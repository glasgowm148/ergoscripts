@Leif Erickson we currently have different full-time and part-time positions in addition to bounties. 
The main directions you can choose from:
1) Ergo Node development in this repo https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo
2) ErgoScript/ErgoTree Interpreter development in this repo https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter
3) Front-end development in Yoroi (working with Emurgo team to fully support Ergo in Yoroi wallet https://github.com/Emurgo/yoroi-frontend)

[08/30/2021 9:18 AM] morphic#4133
Yes, sure, but those I mentioned is of highest priority ATM. The node needs a lot of optimisations to further scale with the growing network usage.


[08/30/2021 9:19 AM] morphic#4133
And Ergo support in Yoroi is lacking behind.

@morphic excellent, thank you!  @greenhat I'll check out sigma-rust soon since it'll take a bit for me to transition in to something in a more dedicated manner.

This is a great idea, I can likely put together one or two.  
For SigmaUSD, are you looking for a walkthrough of the dApp usage?  Or more into the code and contracts.

Hello @everyone! As you may heard, the ErgoHack II will be conducted in the first week of October. 

For having a good ErgoHack, we expect community and core devs to contribute with their tutorials on coding Ergo to support the new inflow of developers.

Tutorials will be rewarded 30-50 ERGs for ecosystem support. To be more organized, I am adding a GitHub link docs that you can reach to Ergo repositoires and add comments or tag yourself on a tutorial topic.

Some other coding tutorials could be:

-ErgoTeam, multi-sig vaults, borrow/lend pools
-Layer 2, sidechains, nipopows
-DEX, AgeUSD, Raffle
-Bridge, EVM compatibility, wrapped assets
-Metaverse, NFT
-Wallets
-Privacy applications
-Timestamp/TX with memo, digital identity


The list below is made by me, so I might confuse the expertise levels because I don't know coding. If you think something is wrong, please notify me in the document. 

If you something in mind, notify me so I can reserve the tutorial topic.

Hey Root, what's the expected format for these tutorials? ReadMEs? Videos? Web pages?


[09/03/2021 10:39 AM] glasgowm#9381
I think all would be suitable


[09/03/2021 10:54 AM] RGL#8584
One thing I asked via DM, but it may just be better to post here. Where do these videos need to be uploaded? Can I upload them on say, my own YouTube channel, or do the finished tutorials need to be sent to someone else to upload? Same with articles and blog posts, would you like to have them posted on the Ergo website, or would my blog be fine?


[09/03/2021 11:49 AM] glasgowm#9381
@root7Z


[09/03/2021 4:14 PM] root7Z#8699
for videos your youtube channel is fine but I will save them to keep an archive of tutorial video in case you delete. For articles and blogposts, if you want to write regularly for Ergo Foundation you should speak with our marketing manager AngieHar(at telegram) or tell me what you want to write so I can contact you to her. or you can post on your own channel as you wish. I'm also DM  ing about this


[09/03/2021 4:14 PM] root7Z#8699
Videos are the priority at the moment, we lack those a lot right now


[09/03/2021 4:16 PM] root7Z#8699
They can also be a general How To Start Coding Ergo explaining tutorial about the ecosystem


[09/03/2021 6:00 PM] root7Z#8699
Also if you don't want to speak in the video, you can include some slide pages for us to follow what you do. In general, it's easier for a new dev to See&Try from video, than writings but if you think that's also needed than please tell me your plan and I'll check how should we do

Honestly, it would be really awesome if we got some **"How to code/create an ERGO mining pool from scratch"** tutorials on YouTube or something because that would definitely help ERGO grow and become more accessible for miners to have more options with how they receive their ergo/payments

For the wallets, do you just mean tutorial on how to setup yoroi / ergo full node (mining and not mining) ?


[09/19/2021 9:08 AM] Elemental#9509
For the wallet, I mean how do we make an app like Yoroi and allow it to create custom wallets for the users
And for the pool, yes. A full detailed tutorial on how to create, and fully setup a custom node/pool for mining

And possibly another tutorial on how to make it (the pool) public with a non-numeric IP like  (website.com), so other miners can connect to the pool

I have spoken to root7z, and started working on a tutorial that is a bridge between **Ergoscript-by-Example** and **AppKit**.  The idea is to take some of the contracts that were written for the Ergo Playground, and use AppKit + local node to actually submit these transactions to testnet.  I feel this documentation is lacking, and would be very beneficial to a brand new Ergo dev.  It will provide most of the knowledge required to actually interact with the blockchain for the first time.

I will do a screen recording video with voiceover.  I'll cover: 
- starting and using the node + wallet
- using appkit as a dependency
- appkit code (communicating with node, boxes, transactions, provers, contracts, etc.)
- basic ergoscript
- walk through transactions in explorer
Any thoughts or additions on this?

Wondering if you can give a quick breakdown of how the randomised pick of winner works? I've read the code and docs but I'm still pretty new to scala and ergoscript


[10/04/2021 12:15 PM] fateme.r#4033
There are different ways of creating random seed based on the blockchain data. We have reviewed and mentioned some of them in the raffle doc.
For example, all box and block ids are random numbers. (Since they are output of hash functions).
But we wanted a random number that can not be influenced by other people. For example, since the box id is the hash of the box contents, the box creator can change the content to create a desired id (By searching and changing the content randomly). Thus a controllable box id is not a good random seed.
We have discussed pros and cons of some random seeds in the raffle doc ‚ÄúRaffle Winner‚Äù section.
https://github.com/ErgoRaffle/raffle-documentation#raffle-winner
Finally we have used the oracle box id as a random seed for our winner selection.

Sorry missed this - sure we could fund something like this @kushti ?


[10/26/2021 10:25 PM] kii#8888
No worries, just wanted to send a ping.


I am trying to get up to speed too, and felt that that would help me and future devs a lot, and have been working through it and being able to see the theories being applied to code helped me understand ergoscript and how to utilize it in a code basis a lot better.

I'm seeing that this could be done in 2 parts, a ergo-playground example, so no set up is needed.

And then also a full setup against test node example. So that people who is trying to onboard onto ergo will know how to set up a test node right away and jump into the good stuff rather than being confused about how to set things up.


I've been asking myself questions while learning like, "How can I learn ergoscript faster?", "How can I apply this to ErgoLend?", "How can I test more contracts faster?" and have found that the above ideas might help me move faster so I can learn more and break things in a controlled environment.


[10/27/2021 10:00 AM] kushti#0978
Yes, there are bounties for submitting such things to the ErgoScript-by-the-Example repo


[10/27/2021 10:09 AM] kushti#0978
It would be awesome if you can document and publish your Ergo endeavours


[10/27/2021 5:31 PM] kii#8888
Okay. I‚Äôll make a pull request to show you what I mean better by EOW. 

I had an idea that is like ergoscript by example, but a little different. 

If we think it‚Äôs better to still have it in the normal ergoscript example format, we can do that too. 

It‚Äôll be clear after I make a PR

Yes. I have and will continue to do so. I‚Äôve mentioned to Glasgow that ive been running a Thursday meet with ergo lend team to explain my understanding of UTXO and ergo and everything ive learned in a more layman understandable way. 

If anyone have time, I‚Äôd love to be able to schedule some time to go through my understanding to validate whether the way I‚Äôm understanding is correct so that I don‚Äôt teach an invalid idea

Calling ERG Artists

Nautilus Wallet needs a logo. 

The name Nautilus is inspired by the Submarine in Jules Verne 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Nautilus is described by Verne as "a masterpiece containing masterpieces", which was built in secrecy, sourcing parts from unnamed sources and roams the seas beyond the reach of land-based governments.

We are offering 10 ERG Tip for the best submission before the end of the year at https://t.me/ergo_nft_trading.

* size: high resolution that can be reduced and remains legible in very small sizes, like 16x16 pixels, or a reduced version of the logo
* format: svg, png and the editable source file

Take a look at the initial concept.

I am looking for an Ergo Script dev to do some paid consultancy work over the next few weeks. 

What I am looking for is a breakdown of how complicated it will be to create 2 smart contracts and a trading bot. (Time taken to code, cost, complexity etc..) 

Short version of the project is bringing something akin to Olympus pro to Ergo. (Smart contract 1) Smart contract 2 is an evolution of that process that offers more flexibility to projects around building treasury and liquidity. 

I have funding, business development, community, and web development resources in place. Ergo script expertise is the final piece of the puzzle to progress this.  

The information from this consultation will be used to complete the pitch deck and feed into the business plan. The Dev that does the consultancy work will be first refusal to take up the lead dev position on the project and receive a revenue share. 

There will not be a token created for this project. Ever.

I posted this before, I dont have funds but the open source version of the ergo miner could use updating and maintaince. It would be a labor of love but it should be the sort of thing blockchain is built off of.

Close sourced miners is against the principles of decentralization
