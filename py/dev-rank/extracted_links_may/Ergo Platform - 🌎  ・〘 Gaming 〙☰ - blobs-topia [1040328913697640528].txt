Is anyone else having buggy issues with the website?

I beat the blobinator, got the 1 ERG reward, and upgraded my armor/weapon.

Sometimes the website shows my post Blobinator blob (with ERG and upgraded), and sometimes it shows my pre Blobinator (less ERG, non-upgraded equiptment)

However, the website always shows my Blobinator victory in history and the spicy outmeal used


[11/30/2022 5:53 AM] Fairchild_freestyle#0000
Wait the blobinator with like 40 wins finally died?

In the "My blob page", you can see the state of the Blob, updated with the current mempool (non-confirmed) transactions.
So the transaction fight result that was making you win at that time was valid and accepted by the mempool.
But it has been not been mined fast enough and was invalidated before the confimation.
Then the transaction making the Blobinator win was valid, accapted by the mempool and confirmed.

A new Blobinator has popup, generated by the fees on the Blob fights, we now have two Blobinators:

(re @Fairchild_freestyle : *Ah wtf.. it showed I had 3.7Σ in my wallet and everything but now it’s gone. Dang it*) 
 
 Did you fought the Bloninator with the fight bot, or from the UI ?


[12/01/2022 10:03 AM] Fairchild_freestyle#0000
From the UI. I don’t know how to use the fightbot I read your explanation but didn’t understand it


[12/01/2022 10:24 AM] ThierryM1212#0000
*How to run the fight bot:
*1) Install nodejs, the bot is tested with nodejs 16.15, but might work on other versions (>= 15)
   https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.16.0/
 (https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.16.0/)2) Checkout blobs-topia repository (need to install git if not installed)
   _$ git clone __https://github.com/ThierryM1212/blobs-topia_
3) Install the dependecies
   _$ cd blobs-topia/blobs-bot
   $ npm install
_4) Install pm2, globally
   _$ npm install pm2 -g
_5) Create the .env file from the example
   _$ cp .env.example .env
_6) Edit the .env file
   The bot will need to sign the transactions for you, and use your mnemonic, the below values needs to be provided
MNEMONIC="abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon"
// Address of the blob owner
ADDRESS="9gzknXKrnvHnoNiFdH5Uywx2FgbSxzGmNT9LX9yyEDa4r6gbcnZ"
// List of blob ID to engage fight
BLOB_LIST="[2,18]"
// min fight value (and default)
MIN_FIGHT_AMOUNT="0.1"
// max fight value
MAX_FIGHT_AMOUNT="0.2"
// Try to engage the blobinator if possible
ENGAGE_BLOBINATOR=TRUE
7) Start the bot with pm2
   _$ pm2 start fight-bot.config.cjs
_   
More:
- Monitor the bot running:
   _$ pm2 monit
_- Stop the bot:
   _$ pm2 stop fight-bot_

 That's a really good idea. This is probably doable but the impact on the contracts wouldn't be that small. And the migration from current Blobs... I've no idea :). That could be v2...

 Good thinking. It would probably be difficult to tie owning the blob to owning the NFT.

(re @Fairchild_freestyle : *Have you talked to mr. stahl? I bet he would help you?*) 
 
 To use AVLTree, it would require to switch to another language, so to re-implement the whole project.


[12/04/2022 9:21 AM] LuivatraEP#0000
yeah and a persistent backend to keep the state of the avl tree


[12/04/2022 9:23 AM] ThierryM1212#0000
Another limitations on the types available forced the code to be a bit more messy than required. For example, just Coll[Coll[Long]] would have helped a lot... but I had to use the more simple Coll[Long]... and to compute the index in the contract 😢


[12/04/2022 9:28 AM] ThierryM1212#0000
(re @LuivatraEP : *yeah and a persistent backend to keep the state of the avl tree*) 
 
 I really like the "without backend" design, at least without a state (database) for the backend. This avoid synchronization issues (or rather delegate this to explorer/node) and make the dApp runs "on the blockchain". Without mysterious operations.


[12/04/2022 9:35 AM] ThierryM1212#0000
I think now the priority is to understand why "random integer modulo 6 = 0" (formula for win of the blob against the blobinator) allows to win far less often than each 6 tries. I would love to find that it requires to be true 2 block in a row to be confirmed, and to have 1/36 winning chance. I could then adjust the displayed probability for the blob and blobinator fights, and the game parameter (Nerf bluib).


[12/04/2022 10:03 AM] ThierryM1212#0000
🤑⚔️ A Blobinator release (https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/bce35dd900cf6bb334b283bf94ad4ca6cf4a8e26782cb55a03539a828f06ac0b) just occured, prepare your bots !

 Fully agree, avltree should only be used when absolutely needed

 Yes, the executable is for windows, the first option (with nodejs and pm2) should work on any platform. But that's require to install sofware and run command lines...

(re @sisyphuspush : *Just got my blob and looking forward to some battles!*) 
 
 Welcome, you can set your Blob "ready to fight for a bet" either manually or using the fight-bot (https://github.com/ThierryM1212/blobs-topia/releases/tag/v1.1.0).


[12/17/2022 5:25 AM] Jpow#2124
would it make sense to have some sort of ratio'd bets for underdogs to incentivize playing even when there's a large discrepancy between players so that let say someone with 33% chance on winning when betting .1 erg instead only risks .07 or something like that? big blob still has favorable odds but small blobs gets a smallish discount and gets to play more games before getting drained.


[12/17/2022 5:26 AM] Jpow#2124
maybe diminishing returns on farming the same blob in a row


[12/17/2022 5:35 AM] Jpow#2124
or let people set a limit on how much power the opponent can have with like a lower limit x% above the player's power. Gives them some sort of risk control.


[12/17/2022 5:39 AM] Jpow#2124
idk seems like there needs to be an incentive for smallers blobs to take on bigger ones and or a deterrent to take on smaller ones.

 Thanks for the suggestions I'm taking notes and will try to improve.
Some explanations and consideration on the subject:

There is currently a "Max power difference" parameter set to 3300 which was supposed to limit the winning ratio to 60%/40% for overpowered Blobs.
The winner of the fight is given by the block ID when the transaction is confirmed by Ergo miners.
It seems the "basic" probability formula cannot be applied and that the power difference gives more advantages than it should.

This is best observed with the Blobinator fights which has an easy formula:
  - Contract: Blob win if (random(int) + BlobId) % 6 = 0 (The rest of integer division, modulo)
    => computed winning ratio: 1/6
    => experimented winning ratio after 566 Blobinator fights: 1/21
    
I've adjusted the Blob and Blobinator fights winning ratio (displayed in the application) to try to be closer to the experimented winning ratio, but the displayed numbers are estimations...

The fight bot can currently "hunt" other engaged Blobs in a bet range... "max power diff" parameter could be added...
Basing the result on the fight history would be really hard to do and a major change.
Having some asymetrical results (a part of the bet returned to the smaller blob in case he lose) could be doable.

I will reduce the "max power diff" in order to nerf Bluib and Wato.


[12/17/2022 8:51 AM] ThierryM1212#0000
The max power diff is now adjusted to 1700 from 3300 which gives back the maximum estimated 60%/40% winning ratio.


[12/18/2022 6:19 AM] Jpow#2124
Thanks for the explanation and cool i'll try again tmr. Out of curiosity have you considering monetizing minting and trading a blob instead of ''p2w'' with oatmeal? No offense im just a salty boi for p2w models xD. But yea aside from removing p2w it'd give players some sort of base value where they can resell to other players at a discount of the mint, gives you "perpetual" rewards with as long as they trade. Expending the item slots and having trades for individual items and rng ''drops'' rarely after fights and all that could be pretty cool and might also be a better way to monetize than straight up paying for advantage. Sry if it's to much feedback lmao, i have no clue how much work ur looking to sink into this or what it implies on your end to do any of this, just spitballing. In anycase, have a great day!

 Thanks for the feedback.

Currently you can put your Blob on Sale for an amount you choose, it will appear in the "Blob's shop".
It seems everyone is loving too much its Blob to sell it.

I've tried to make something more scalable for the items but I've not really manage to do it.
It should be possible to extend... but this would require an upgrade of the Blobs to a new contract.
Make them tradable... this would be a big change.

For the p2w model... I'm quite happy with it, it is intended to make the Blobs fight:
  - Either you can buy *1 Oatmeal for 0.1 ERG*.
  - Or you can use *0.1 ERG* to fight another Blob:
       - lose or win 0.1
       - win *1 or 3 Oatmeal
*       - win 1 Spicy Oatmeal to fight the Blobinator later
       - increase your game statistics

"For the p2w model... I'm quite happy with it, it is intended to make the Blobs fight: - Either you can buy 1 Oatmeal for 0.1 ERG."

My experience was pretty much this, minted blob, put 1erg on it and start from scratch. was fun to play against other starters and averaging close to 50/50 winrate, up until wato and red drops in and it just feels like getting farmed, at which point i stopped. Imnt sure the p2w model is incentivizing anyone to fight, and might be having the opposite effect. thinking it's partly due to the very small playerbase at launch and the massive gap in strength p2w creates. otherwise there'd be at least a dozen bots from people here running non stop fighting against each other, but that's not the case because the result would simply be wato and red takes all and it wouldn't take much time. atm risk/reward just isnt there to incentivize playing imo, especially not automating.

Anyways, that's pretty much all the feedback i got, you do what you will with it and i wish you the best of luck.


[12/19/2022 1:11 AM] ThierryM1212#0000
With 390 fights / 216 victories for Wato and 357 fights / 154 victories for Red, they have not really farmed anyone. And have not required to buy Oatmeal to Equip them.


[12/19/2022 2:06 AM] Jpow#2124
thats fair. was speaking from my perspective as a new player which is obviously flawed. if nothing else hopefully it's an insight as to what players may have as an impression when starting out the game. Maybe im retarded, that's also possible. :lmao:

 The 60/40 max percentage differential means even against those OP ones I do decently


[12/21/2022 9:34 AM] Jpow#2124
i dont have much of a problem iwth the winning odds, it's normal that someone that much higher level has more chance to win and the more chance to earn. It's about the incentive to take the fight as the underdog. asymmetric bets, dynamic oatmeal rewards or whatever idk what would work best just that something is missing imo.


[12/21/2022 9:37 AM] Jpow#2124
like it'd be nice if you would get more oatmeal for fighting someone thats higher than you and vice versa for someone that's lower. allows underdog to catch up faster by taking higher risk and it's less incentive for the bigger player to target the weakest blobs.


[12/21/2022 9:42 AM] Jpow#2124
same idea with asymmetric bets except they don't allow you to close the gap, just to play longer. and maybe there's a middle ground like that if you use a handful of different incentive mechanism so that a bet can be worth it for both party to take a fight. like ''its ez money'' for the big blob but also for the small blob ''its good exp''.


[12/21/2022 9:47 AM] Jpow#2124
system like that would also work to prevent snowballing. leader would always get less ''progress'' than everyone else, and this would help keeping the competition going.


[12/21/2022 10:49 PM] Jpow#2124
:lmao: yea i think im done. gl to ur project.

 Hello, that would be great. I think I still need few adjustments and more tests on my side, but it should come soon. I need first to take a step back and really benchmark the option pricing formula, AND produce documents so users are aware of the benchmark of the formula... the limits... accuracy compared to others...
