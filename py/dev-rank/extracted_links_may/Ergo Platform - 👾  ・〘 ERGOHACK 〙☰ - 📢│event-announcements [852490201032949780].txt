Hello teams! How is your first week of the hackathon going? 

SHORT UPDATES. As you already know, our hackathon will run for three weeks:
the first week is to discuss ideas and the next two weeks to develop a prototype.

At the end of each week, you will be asked to fill out interim reports. This is highly important to capture your sprint achievements and will help our judges in making the right decision. 

Fill in your first week results here https://q9fwzopidh8.typeform.com/to/WR2IOaP1

We encourage Team Leads to fill out the form for simplicity. However, if individual team members also want to participate, feel free!

All the reports have to be filled out by Sunday noon (12PM UTC) 

We wish you good luck!

Hey Teams :kushtii: @ERGOHACKFEST-Participants 

Many thanks for all of your presentations! üéâ  We have received an impressive amount of materials and hope that you'll keep the ball rolling with your projects. All of your work and energy is why we think the Ergo Ecosystem and community are one of the best! 

The judging panel has been confirmed and they have already begun reviewing all of your materials. Our next blog post will highlight the adjudicators and offer a little bit of information about them. As there are many submissions and the judging panel is very busy with other projects, please be aware it may take a couple of weeks for them to fully review the materials and make their decisions. Don't worry, we'll keep you posted!

In the meantime, we would like you to submit your Ergo wallet addresses to us so that we may disperse the side prizes from the Ergo Foundation and our sponsors: ErgoPad and darkfund0. 

**IMPORTANT: **In order to make the payment process more efficient, we will send rewards to Team Leads, and then they can distribute the rewards within their respective teams.

Please use the form to provide wallets for your teams. Try to provide with your wallets no later than **Wednesday, Jun 8** to speed up the process.
