[11/27/2022 6:00 PM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#0000
Is there a way to pull up the rarest citizen of all?


[11/27/2022 6:01 PM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#0000
Like rank #1 or is that dependent on someone just randomly minting it and checking in the cc channel?


[11/27/2022 6:01 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
minting cybercitizens nfts are totally random


[11/27/2022 6:03 PM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#0000
I know but what I mean is, is there a list that one could look at to see all the citizens


[11/27/2022 6:07 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Not at the moment... we had search feature, but it was super messed and only way to search specific citizen for with their ID...


[11/27/2022 6:08 PM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#0000

@Mr.Pixel have you guys started designing the pets yet of that’s far away still?


[11/28/2022 8:18 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
We do have some designs for pets, but they aren’t the final versions. 
We mostly focused on the map, new designs of audio NFTs as you could see in the Halloween airdrop event etc…


[11/28/2022 8:20 AM] Kilver#0000
Well I’m surprised you guys managed to squeeze that in there to already. 😁

How many left to mint?


[11/28/2022 10:02 AM] 3rd#0000
i participated in the ICO, was i meant to get a free audio NFT?


[11/28/2022 10:21 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Still a fair bit left , let me double check for the audio nft, but I do believe so


[11/28/2022 10:33 AM] Kilver#0000
I have picked up Cyberpunk 2077 again a week ago. Haven’t played it since it got released first time. I can’t believe that after so much time and updates the same is still a broken and glitchy mess…


[11/28/2022 10:44 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Oh yeah I’ve noticed your always on there hahahah, damm I heard it got a bit better but never tried it , seems like a super cool game though if not for bugs


[11/28/2022 10:59 AM] Kilver#0000
Yeah they did a bit of polishing and added a bit of extra content. But what good if my game crashes constantly and I’m getting random glitches all the time.


[11/28/2022 11:10 AM] mongocm#0000
Ahh yeah that is a shame :(


[11/28/2022 12:16 PM] Kilver#0000

[11/28/2022 12:17 PM] Kilver#0000
Nice, just testing


[11/28/2022 12:45 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Yah, but we haven’t airdropped it yet


[11/28/2022 12:46 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
If someone is struggling with cybercitizen nft loading in wallet, use this command on discord: !c number

@Mr.Pixel hey you helped me fix Nautilus wallet not loading stuff before. Was it the GraphQL server that needs to change?


[11/28/2022 1:15 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
This?


[11/28/2022 1:18 PM] Kilver#0000
yeah.


[11/28/2022 1:18 PM] Kilver#0000
still doesn't load... hmm..


[11/28/2022 1:19 PM] Kilver#0000
maybe is the explorer url


[11/28/2022 1:19 PM] Kilver#0000
what other options are other than https://explorer.ergoplatform.com?


[11/28/2022 1:21 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
.


[11/28/2022 1:21 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Try to change explorer and graphql instances in nautilus wallet settings: 

Alternative GraphQL instances to put into Nautilus
  - https://ergo-explorer.getblok.io/graphql/
  - https://graphql.erg.zelcore.io
  - https://explore.sigmaspace.io/api/graphql
  - https://ergo-explorer.anetabtc.io/graphql

Alternative Explorer instances to put into Nautilus
- https://ergo-explorer.anetabtc.io/graphql
- https://ergo-explorer.getblok.io/graphql/


[11/28/2022 1:21 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Try one of these


[11/28/2022 1:24 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Strange… will try to send some funds somewhere when I get home


[11/28/2022 1:25 PM] Kilver#0000
thanks for your help! I will try again later when I get home.


[11/28/2022 1:26 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Np 🦾


[11/28/2022 1:29 PM] Kilver#0000
Don’t know why, sometimes on SH I can’t list or change the price of anything. I assume it has to do with  Nautilus


[11/28/2022 1:29 PM] Kilver#0000
Last time your fix worked


[11/28/2022 1:30 PM] ManthanShah#0000
jfi, How do you prove to someone that you are the owner of your nft ...


[11/28/2022 1:31 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Why do you ask? 😆 just send them nautilus wallet nft inventory? Not sure


[11/28/2022 1:31 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Like a screenshot


[11/28/2022 1:32 PM] CM Mongo#0000
you can view the token id on ergotokens.org of the nft and it will specify the mint date and minted collection address and the currrent address, that’s one way to do it


[11/28/2022 1:32 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Ohh yah. This is way better


[11/28/2022 1:33 PM] ManthanShah#0000
yes, but how do you prove that this address belongs to you only. you have to send some erg from that address i guess.


[11/28/2022 1:35 PM] CM Mongo#0000
hmm yeah, I think that would be the only way


[11/28/2022 1:36 PM] ManthanShah#0000
hmmm


[11/28/2022 1:37 PM] Kilver#0000
IAre afraid that someone has or claims to have an NFT on a wallet but is asking for payment on a different wallet?


[11/28/2022 1:40 PM] ManthanShah#0000
no i just want to know, if i say tomorrow that top most erg holding wallet is mine, how you can prove to someone without sending erg from that address, same with nft...


[11/28/2022 1:41 PM] Kilver#0000
Yeah, in that case moving a specific amount around is the only way. That’s the beauty of crypto.


[11/28/2022 1:41 PM] ManthanShah#0000
yes


[11/28/2022 1:43 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
(re  : *<ManthanShah> no i just want to know, if i say tomorrow that top most erg holding wallet is mine, how you can prove to someone without sending erg from that address, same with nft...*) 
 
 Can also post NFT for sale on SH/AH for a specific amount to prove ownership

What’s ordering curb side?


[11/28/2022 4:15 PM] CM Mongo#0000
was grabbing McDonald’s haha they have the app to order on the app and park in a spot and they come out and bring it to you


[11/28/2022 4:15 PM] Kilver#0000
Ah I see.


[11/28/2022 4:16 PM] CM Mongo#0000

[11/28/2022 7:32 PM] Kilver#0000
well initially I just wanted to change some prices and it would never load. so I tried to list one and I got this


[11/28/2022 7:33 PM] Kilver#0000
do I have too many NFTs for sale?


[11/28/2022 7:34 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
No idea. First time seeing this issue... definitely recommend to ask skyharbor team..


[11/28/2022 7:35 PM] Kilver#0000
ok, I will try SH discord, thx!


[11/28/2022 7:36 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
You may have to consolidate boxes


[11/28/2022 7:37 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
I had same issue not too long ago and just created a new wallet for my HODL NFTs and it worked after that


[11/28/2022 7:38 PM] IIAB#0000
Also real ez to consolidate boxes with the tokenJay app!! And you'd have to do it eventually even with your hodling wallet!


[11/28/2022 7:40 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
will be doing list today 🙂

[11/28/2022 8:09 PM] Bonzo#0000
If you haven’t figured it out yet.. you need to send you NFT + ERG (for transaction fees) to yourself. This will create a new UTxO box with just the one NFT in it.


[11/28/2022 8:10 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
It's now added into our WP here

If anyone notice there is missing an audionft, tag me, please. They should be correct tho


[11/28/2022 8:23 PM] Kilver#0000
So send them all in 1 transaction to another wallet. Then can I send them back to the original address?


[11/28/2022 8:24 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Think he means generate another address within your wallet and send between them ? Not 100% sure


[11/28/2022 8:24 PM] Kilver#0000
I do have 2 other addresses that I never used so I ca do that


[11/28/2022 8:46 PM] tyja9#0000
Just send it to yourself


[11/28/2022 9:39 PM] reshadk#0000

[11/28/2022 9:53 PM] Kilver#0000
Surprisingly. As apartments were supposed to be rarer


[11/28/2022 9:56 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
They are rarer. It’s really about a luck.


[11/28/2022 9:56 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

[11/28/2022 10:56 PM] Kilver#0000
Nop. Weirdly enough I can cancel some listings, not all of them. I will try tomorrow to send my NFTs to another address and see if that works


[11/28/2022 11:07 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Just send them to me 😉

Friendly reminder to keep your pass phrases safe. I just had a scare of losing my wallet with almost 100 enft’s I’ve collected over the past year plus.


[11/29/2022 12:57 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
wait what happened?


[11/29/2022 1:05 AM] exoticplug#0000
I needed my addy for the free mint and didn’t have a wallet loaded so I tried restoring what I thought was my main wallet and it loaded with nothing. Scary because I thought I only had 1 phrase then I remembered I might’ve wrote another one down somewhere else and thankfully that turned out to be true and the one with all my assets.


[11/29/2022 1:07 AM] exoticplug#0000
I was shitting my pants for a sec


[11/29/2022 1:17 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
ohh... glad it turned out well.. a similar thing happened to me when I was restoring Cardano's wallet..I was struggling to recover my main wallet due to multiple wallets I had


[11/29/2022 1:26 AM] exoticplug#0000
Yeah I’m just happy I didn’t lose it and now have it much more obvious


[11/29/2022 1:27 AM] exoticplug#0000

Are monkeys rare?


[11/29/2022 4:28 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Yes they are


[11/29/2022 4:30 AM] theta_decay#0000
I think I got some, but they weren't high ranking.


[11/29/2022 4:32 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
What number are they? i think most of them are quite rare


[11/29/2022 4:32 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
like top 200 at least no?

Must be the least rare monkey lol


[11/29/2022 4:36 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
loool maybe, but still a monkey which looks sick in game.


[11/29/2022 5:43 AM] Szabber#0000

[11/29/2022 6:54 AM] MDMTXO#0000
it was middle of the night for me just added an address , thought if someone wasn't mentioned and added their address won't be eligible 🤣🤣


[11/29/2022 6:56 AM] lexymon#0000
i deleted my address again after i understood what it was about lol


[11/29/2022 6:58 AM] IIAB#0000
Lolz, what was it about then? I dont understand either! 🤣


[11/29/2022 6:59 AM] lexymon#0000
if you retweeted a post from nov21st you were tagged in tonights post, if not, you are not eligble.


[11/29/2022 6:59 AM] lexymon#0000
i thiiiink


[11/29/2022 6:59 AM] MDMTXO#0000
twitter didn't bother notify me that someone mentioned me 🤣


[11/29/2022 7:00 AM] Kilver#0000
It did for me, I saw the notification but I didn’t bother to open it I was sleeping already.


[11/29/2022 7:06 AM] IIAB#0000
Riiight! Suppose I was eligible, but extremely late! 🤣


[11/29/2022 7:22 AM] ThatOtherFella#0000
So if you are mentioned in the post are you guaranteed a nft? Or was it just a bonus notification to get in early?


[11/29/2022 7:23 AM] MDMTXO#0000
guaranteed if you commented before 35 people 😅


[11/29/2022 7:23 AM] Kilver#0000
Initially I understood that you automatically get one when you retweet the only tweet but I guess only the 33fastest to reply to last night’s one get it


[11/29/2022 7:23 AM] Kilver#0000

[11/29/2022 7:25 AM] ThatOtherFella#0000
Damn.. I did comment my adress in time then figured I was already in from being mentioned.. so I deleted my post 😩


[11/29/2022 7:25 AM] ThatOtherFella#0000
Twitter novice..


[11/29/2022 7:27 AM] Kilver#0000
I guess it was not really clear in the old tweet that this is how is going to play out.


[11/29/2022 7:27 AM] Kilver#0000
It seemed you just get a free mint


[11/29/2022 7:28 AM] ThatOtherFella#0000
Ahhh I'm so annoyed


[11/29/2022 7:29 AM] Kilver#0000
I thing the wording should have been different like like and retweet for a change to win a free mint for example.


[11/29/2022 7:29 AM] Kilver#0000

[11/29/2022 7:30 AM] lexymon#0000
agree, and the wording of the recent tweet was confusing for everyone who didnt see the first tweet


[11/29/2022 7:31 AM] lexymon#0000
things like that can cause more harm than good on a larger scale, because many people would be upset ^^ luckily ergo is a small family where everyone loves eachother lol


[11/29/2022 7:32 AM] Kilver#0000
At the end of the day is it what it is.


[11/29/2022 7:32 AM] ThatOtherFella#0000
Yea agreed with the wording. One of the reasons why I deleted my comment.. maybe it was logged before I deleted it.. hopefully


[11/29/2022 7:52 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
There is only 80 monkeys out of 2081 NFTs tho


[11/29/2022 7:56 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000

yesterday you posted a publication on twitter, where it said to put your wallet address and you would release a free mint, will it be by lottery?


[11/30/2022 12:11 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
The post was meant to be for 65 people who retweeted our wave3 announcement tweet. All 65 people were mentioned in this post and first 33 out of those 65 people who type their ergo address could receive 1 free minted nft. (cybercitizen)

💤 Good evening, Citizens!
📄 Here is a full list of yesterday's addresses who participated in the FREE MINT event from 65 mentioned ones.

🟦 33 Winners 
🟥 16 Late Participants

🎁 The 33 Winners will receive FREE CYBERCITIZEN within 24 hours
🍾 Congratulations!

🚨 We have also read your feedback regarding this FREE MINT event and will try to be more specific next time. We would like to apologise for this mistake. For this mini event, we didn't pay attention to the "details" because it was one of those smaller events and we just wanted to give some extra gifts to the community. 
🙏 We are so grateful for everyone who is part of the community and constantly engages in the conversation in #deleted-channel.

Not sure, I usually just open ergo explorer with my wallet and see the latest transactions. 
You can check what NFTs you receive in those transactions.

It's gonna be tomorrow on 100%, I promise! We are all overload with work...

Yes. Not sure if I've shared this before. We are pretty much done with 1,3 and 4. (From the roadmap picture)
I fully finished basic UI design for the in-game marketplace like an hour ago. Currently doing last changes on the new version of the map before sending it to game dev. 
Next step 2,5,6 and 7.  (From the roadmap picture)

Two days ago I minted a few citizens for myself as well, and I have to say I felt that FOMO. 😆
I ended up minting 8 CyberCitizens and also got 2 cybereggs and Serum 🦾


[12/01/2022 3:56 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
I suppose I should have minted more than 3.


[12/01/2022 3:57 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

How are you guys veiwing your CyberEggs?


[12/01/2022 8:09 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
You can see CyberEggs NFTs in your wallet, if you received some from wave3 drop.


[12/01/2022 8:10 PM] Futurejon5#0000
I am using Yoroi that is probably why.


[12/01/2022 8:10 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
ohh.... 😅


[12/01/2022 8:10 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

[12/01/2022 8:11 PM] Futurejon5#0000

Hey now lol that was the only wallet thats upported ERG at the time.


[12/01/2022 8:12 PM] Futurejon5#0000
Can't see the Eggs on skyharbor


[12/01/2022 8:12 PM] Kilver#0000
I know. I used it and I hated every second if it.


[12/01/2022 8:13 PM] Kilver#0000
Happy we have a few good options now.


[12/01/2022 8:13 PM] Futurejon5#0000
Oh yes it is horrible 😢 I just need to take the time and migrate.


[12/01/2022 8:14 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
well, there is a drop rate chance to receive cyber egg as a  gift


[12/01/2022 8:14 PM] Futurejon5#0000
Yes it was drop from mint


[12/01/2022 8:15 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
did you get cyberegg along with cybercitizen as a reward?


[12/01/2022 8:15 PM] Futurejon5#0000
Yes


[12/01/2022 8:16 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
you can't see the egg cause it's loading a picture or you can't see it in general in your wallet 😆


[12/01/2022 8:16 PM] Futurejon5#0000
Just data in yoroi and nothing on SkyH


[12/01/2022 8:17 PM] Futurejon5#0000
Yoroi doesn't show NFTs unfortunately

[12/01/2022 8:19 PM] Kilver#0000
Curious to see what egg it is


[12/01/2022 8:19 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
nautilus


[12/01/2022 8:20 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
same here lol


[12/01/2022 8:20 PM] Futurejon5#0000
hmm I use Nautilus to connect to Sky Harbor


[12/01/2022 8:21 PM] Kilver#0000
@Mr.Pixel can you check what egg it is?


[12/01/2022 8:21 PM] Futurejon5#0000
I probably should clean up my shit


[12/01/2022 8:24 PM] Futurejon5#0000
Well, it is purple according to metadata


[12/01/2022 8:24 PM] Kilver#0000
Not bad.


[12/01/2022 8:27 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I use nautilus for everything. Spectrum, skyharbor, duckpools etc...


[12/01/2022 8:29 PM] Futurejon5#0000
Yeah I have it and just have my yoroi linked to it. Nautilus is not showing everything so I will probably just generate a new wallet and transfer everything.


[12/01/2022 8:29 PM] Futurejon5#0000
Ok now it is showing in Nautilus


[12/01/2022 8:30 PM] Futurejon5#0000
Nice.


[12/01/2022 8:30 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
so everything's fine?


[12/01/2022 8:31 PM] Futurejon5#0000
Yup, just needed to open Nautilus and let it catch up


[12/01/2022 8:31 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
glad to hear that!


[12/01/2022 8:31 PM] Futurejon5#0000

[12/01/2022 10:37 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Didn't think I could get more excited for the game to drop, but here we are


[12/01/2022 10:38 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
So the real question I have is, how does one become Elite? That VIP room in the club has my name all over it !


[12/01/2022 10:39 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Will it be related to XP credits and levels?


[12/01/2022 10:40 PM] Kilver#0000
I think it would make sense to be reserved for gold/ platinum EGIO stakers. But I don’t know.


[12/01/2022 10:41 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Yeah, I'm slacking on my EGIO accumulation/staking


[12/01/2022 10:43 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Patience, sir. We just got listed on spectrum 😅 
But the old tokens will definitely be exchangeable


[12/01/2022 10:43 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Why egio staker?


[12/01/2022 10:44 PM] Kilver#0000
CYPX staker?


[12/01/2022 10:44 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
CYPX staking?

[12/02/2022 6:07 AM] IIAB#0000
Same! i'm a very impatient receiver of free stuff. Was it like 6 month ago the list of free mints was made public? I dont know any more, feels like i've been waiting for ever! Is it 2080 yet?  I think the AirDrop delirium is kicking in. 🤣


[12/02/2022 6:38 AM] Mr.Pixel#2557
I’m guys trying 😆 hazey been very busy so I asked him if breehze could airdrop he. After he responded to me yesterday, breehze was already in bed saying he will airdrop it  tomorrow evening (friday)😅

They are planning to do it today.


[12/02/2022 9:35 AM] Kilver#0000
Ugh I just noticed serums stack like songs they are not individual NFTs like eggs. I actually have 2 rainbow and 4 greens ones.


[12/02/2022 9:36 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Yep. Serums and Audionfts stack, cybereggs are unique


[12/02/2022 9:36 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Like unique token ids


[12/02/2022 9:37 AM] Kilver#0000

[12/02/2022 9:11 PM] Futurejon5#0000

**To verify yourself  as a Cybercitizen use !verify address holding Cybercitizen NFT**


[12/02/2022 9:12 PM] Futurejon5#0000
The comand is !verify+ your addy


[12/02/2022 10:22 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
It's a new mini gambling project on ergo. They have only coin flip atm, but they plan to create more minigames. They also listed CYPX today, so you can now bid with cypx tokens. 
Anyway guys, don't gamble. It's addictive LOL

[12/03/2022 3:34 PM] OliverL#0000

I can't seem to find mine 🤔


[12/03/2022 3:37 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Did you get one as a reward? 
In wave3, the real estate has a very low % chance to drop along with cybercitizen as a reward.


[12/03/2022 3:38 PM] OliverL#0000
I minted on yesterday evening. I can supply you with the token ID if you'd need it.

[12/03/2022 6:45 PM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#0000
I'll sell you the apartment for 275 though 😅


[12/03/2022 6:46 PM] Kilver#0000
I’m pretty much broke after the mint, but I will keep your offer in mind.


[12/03/2022 6:47 PM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#0000
Sounds good, don't be surprised though if the price goes up if somebody buys the one for 350


[12/03/2022 7:33 PM] OliverL#0000
So the average selling price reported is mostly small apartments? 🤔


[12/03/2022 8:35 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
is there an average selling price somewhere?  that collection does have small apartments so the floor would reflect that


[12/03/2022 8:40 PM] OliverL#0000
The all-knowing bot seems to post average sales prices in the #sales-bot channels. And I also assume it's tracking is from the skyharbor nft site.
So far 3 small and 2 middle apartments has been sold.


[12/03/2022 8:40 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Ayo @slapshottwelve the pfp….🦾

[12/03/2022 8:48 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
Ahh okay thats the floor price of what is currently for sale.  There are more pages to sales on skyharbor (i did not look close enough the first time either) about 15 sold


[12/03/2022 8:52 PM] CC#1982#0000
Ohh my bad. I glossed over the amount of sales scale in the activity tab


[12/03/2022 8:54 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
how many penthouses are out there?! there must be 1 from the original apartment mint but were there other airdrops?


[12/03/2022 8:55 PM] CC#1982#0000
Not sure my man. This is the first Ergo project I've minted and I joined yesterday :Smile:


[12/03/2022 8:56 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
nope, only 1!


[12/03/2022 8:58 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
there is in total something around 86 Apartments atm


[12/03/2022 8:58 PM] CC#1982#0000
👀 I'm glad I minted one


[12/03/2022 8:59 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
not even sure who got the penthouse from the drop


[12/03/2022 9:02 PM] CC#1982#0000

[12/03/2022 9:03 PM] slapshottwelve#0000

The audionfts haven’t been listed yet. That’s why we mentioned only serums, cyber eggs and body parts. 
They don’t support the audionfts atm.

[12/05/2022 3:17 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
that rainbow serum for only 60 erg?! Seems like a steal for a 1/17 item.  Might just buy it for myself


[12/05/2022 3:22 PM] Kilver#0000
Yeah saw that


[12/05/2022 3:22 PM] Kilver#0000
Too bad I’m erg broke atm


[12/05/2022 3:25 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
looks like we might get another leg down in the markets next month or so.  hoping to accumulate some more


[12/05/2022 3:32 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
woah someone snatched that serum up!


[12/05/2022 3:32 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
why do you think so? 🤔 😅


[12/05/2022 3:38 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
well outside of FTX and genesis blowing up the space... based on the TA i follow on twitter 😅 NFA!  But following bitcoin looks like its stuck in a pretty bearish 60 day cycle...


[12/05/2022 3:38 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
think it needs to break above 18k and todays candle is already way down


[12/05/2022 3:56 PM] Thirdstryker#0000

can someone explain please what egg, parts and serum do


[12/06/2022 4:13 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
From our whitepaper: 

CYBER EGGS - During the wave 3 mint, each minter will have a chance to receive Cyber eggs, which can hatch into pets in the future!

SERUMS - Serums are used to mutate your Citizen and experiment with their bodies. Beware, some experiments can be riskier than others.

BODY PARTS - Upgradeable robotic parts for your CyberCitizen, upgraded traits will have a sleeker view and be made with better materials! (Only robotic traits will be upgradeable)


[12/06/2022 5:51 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
took me 3 more mints but finally got an egg!


[12/06/2022 5:53 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

Today I finished a large Domino’s pizza by myself. I definitely don’t recommend it. I’m so full I can’t even move. I usually keep 3-4 slices for lunch the next day.

I do that but with Oreo cookies, I always regret it and tell myself I’m never eating another Oreo cookie and few days later I see a pack of Oreo cookies and am like oh boy here we go

[12/08/2022 10:46 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
makes you a better investor in the future! i cant tell you how many shitcoins ive bought.... not making that mistake again (i hope)


[12/08/2022 10:52 AM] Kilver#0000
It’s not a coin it’s a miner. And I can stomach being down 73%. Problem is that the price has fallen to 1.07$. If it spends more than 30 consecutive days under 1$ it will get delisted. Also they are not selling any BTC that they are mining so they other sources of revenue bring in around 4-5 mil per quarter and the operations cost them around 50 mil. They have 30mil cash in hand so that means that they will either have to sell some BTC or sell some shared and dilute the shareholders even further. But then the delisting problem appears and if they sell their BTC after vehemently proclaiming a 100% hold strategy for so long it will make them look bad.


[12/08/2022 10:56 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
ohhhh yea thats different.  where are the miners listed?


[12/08/2022 10:56 AM] Kilver#0000
NASDAQ


[12/08/2022 11:00 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
wonder if other miners might be in the same boat....


[12/08/2022 11:02 AM] Kilver#0000
Depends. They are all in a bad situation at the moment.

bad time to sell BTC, bad time to get delisted, seems like selling shares would be best option.  hopefully the gains next bull run makes up for the diluting


[12/08/2022 11:15 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
I thought adding grayscale, coin, etc to my 401k/ira was good at the time (still might be long run) but seems if you involve VCs and earnings in crypto youre going to have a bad time


[12/08/2022 5:31 PM] Kilver#0000
Those are are having their price per share smashed but other than that still solid.


[12/08/2022 10:20 PM] Kilver#0000

Going to celebrate with a mint


[12/12/2022 12:50 PM] ihunt86#0000
Got my body part!Still trying to understand how they will be used.. there are so few of them. Will people be able to buy them in the game, or are these the only ones that will be in the game .


[12/12/2022 12:50 PM] ihunt86#0000
This is a good idea I might have to as welll


[12/12/2022 12:52 PM] Kilver#0000
If your character has a robotic arm you can swap it for that one to make it look cooler


[12/12/2022 12:55 PM] Kilver#0000
I assume they will eventually be available to buy in game with CYPX. We need to give CYPX as much utility as possible not to end up a stake and dump token


[12/12/2022 2:14 PM] ihunt86#0000

we added some glow effects, shades to the map (atm its just for the city)


[12/13/2022 6:31 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Love the glow effects


[12/13/2022 6:42 PM] chuckedup#0000

[12/13/2022 6:45 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
you can also see the new map design


[12/13/2022 6:48 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
Any plans to make map interactive to show location (+details) of various apartments and buildings on it?


[12/13/2022 7:09 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
we do only have for apartments locations this map https://cybercitizens.io/pages/cyberia-estates.html . But we will be redoing it for sure. 
I'm thinking of adding just whole map and mini-map into the game.


[12/13/2022 7:12 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
wrong link: https://cybercitizens.io/pages/cyberia-map.html


[12/13/2022 7:23 PM] chuckedup#0000

[12/13/2022 7:40 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000

[12/13/2022 8:01 PM] Thirdstryker#0000

[12/13/2022 8:02 PM] Kilver#0000
What’s holding you back?


[12/13/2022 8:03 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
Isn't there a mint?


[12/13/2022 8:04 PM] Kilver#0000
Yeah… and?


[12/13/2022 8:10 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
Well I am waiting for that


[12/13/2022 8:14 PM] Kilver#0000
I don't even know when that's goin to happen.


[12/13/2022 11:21 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
Is there another apartment mint? i thought the one in june was the only one.  Figured the only way to get one now is by luck in the cybercitizen mint or secondary markets?


[12/13/2022 11:21 PM] CM Mongo#0000
There will be one in the future, just no concrete dates have been set


[12/14/2022 2:52 PM] chuckedup#0000
how many citizens are left in the mint?


[12/14/2022 2:53 PM] Kilver#0000
My guess is still a lot.


[12/14/2022 2:53 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Maybe 20-25% is my guess


[12/14/2022 2:54 PM] Kilver#0000
You’re saying there are around 200-250left?


[12/14/2022 2:55 PM] Kilver#0000
I think around 400-500 more likely


[12/14/2022 2:55 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Double that, likely


[12/14/2022 2:55 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
There are 2k+ of them


[12/14/2022 2:56 PM] Kilver#0000
Sorry I was calculating the wave 3 only


[12/14/2022 2:56 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
gothca....yeah, I think 4-500 is about where they are at


[12/14/2022 2:57 PM] Kilver#0000
It’s ok. We just need the last dump to happen Jan-March and then ride the wave to lambos and chicken tendies.


[12/14/2022 2:59 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
2K isnt that many given the scope of the game and the anticipated growth of Ergo in general. There are a lot of you whales out there as well


[12/14/2022 3:00 PM] Kilver#0000
We ride the ERGO wave to 0 or hero. Nothing in between.


[12/14/2022 3:00 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
100%


[12/14/2022 3:00 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

[12/14/2022 3:02 PM] Kilver#0000
I might make myself a Christmas gift and do another mint for myself later in the month.


[12/14/2022 3:04 PM] Kilver#0000
But also that 89 erg apartment is winking at me.


[12/14/2022 3:04 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I know, right?


[12/14/2022 3:04 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Someone beat me to the punch for the cheap monkey...been having my eye on a couple more hoping they drop a little


[12/14/2022 3:04 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
and that 10ERG Epic Egg


[12/14/2022 3:05 PM] Kilver#0000
Yeah that monkey hunt was inspired. Good buys.


[12/14/2022 3:05 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
and that 20ERG Epic Egg


[12/14/2022 3:06 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
was playing a barman job yesterday (testing it) and I must say, I need more cybercitizens for myself as well


[12/14/2022 3:06 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
10 ERG serum...so much to buy


[12/14/2022 3:06 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
for stamina


[12/14/2022 3:06 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
i will check later today, but it has been slowed a lot.


[12/14/2022 3:06 PM] chuckedup#0000
Do or die Ergo, keep buying the dip till it stops dipping


[12/14/2022 3:06 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
If you need some testers, let me know...looking forward to slinging drinks with my monkey


[12/14/2022 3:07 PM] Kilver#0000
Can’t go lower than 0 that’s for sure.


[12/14/2022 3:07 PM] chuckedup#0000
Is there an advantage to having multiple citizens. I have many


[12/14/2022 3:07 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
there will be at start, it seems.


[12/14/2022 3:08 PM] chuckedup#0000

Didnt get one of the tradable items so looking to buy 1. Thoughts on serum vs egg? Serums sound fun but scare me a bit, lol


[12/14/2022 3:10 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Also, @Mr.Pixel..Do you know if there will be another wave of Egg drops prior to the hatching event?


[12/14/2022 3:10 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Other than them being randomly dropped to minters.


[12/14/2022 3:11 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Other than them being randomly dropped to CC minters.


[12/14/2022 3:12 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Eggs = pets 
Serums = mutations (new traits may appear on your cybercitizen)


[12/14/2022 3:12 PM] Chuck#0000
So the serum might not work too?


[12/14/2022 3:13 PM] Kilver#0000
I need to understand how the serum works in the first place. Is it on ingame appearance or you burn the old NFT and mint a new one with new traits?


[12/14/2022 3:13 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Yeah, thats what scares me a bit...the unknown


[12/14/2022 3:13 PM] Kilver#0000
I need to understand how the serum works in the first place. Is it only ingame appearance or you burn the old NFT and mint a new one with new traits?


[12/14/2022 3:14 PM] Kilver#0000
If it’s just customization ingame is ok but if it creates a unique new nft then it’s quite valuable


[12/14/2022 3:15 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Possibly...but what if the mutation turns out badly?

It’s the risk you are willing to take


[12/14/2022 3:15 PM] Kilver#0000
Or not


[12/14/2022 3:16 PM] Chuck#0000
Yea, if you get a new NFT with weird mutations, that would be pretty cool


[12/14/2022 3:17 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I swear to baby Jesus...if this project keeps coming up with ways to make part with my $ERG I'll have to be slinging drinks 24/7.


[12/14/2022 3:17 PM] Chuck#0000
I wonder what kind of pets hatch too 🤔

[12/14/2022 3:19 PM] Chuck#0000
Have all of the eternal ones been minted?


[12/14/2022 3:20 PM] Kilver#0000
I don’t know.


[12/14/2022 3:20 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000

[12/14/2022 3:22 PM] Kilver#0000
I know @Mr.Pixel has a diamond one.


[12/14/2022 3:23 PM] Kilver#0000
I need 1 diamond and 1 eternal and I would have 1 of each.


[12/14/2022 3:24 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
You'll need a zoo


[12/14/2022 3:24 PM] Chuck#0000
itching to mint now lmao


[12/14/2022 3:26 PM] Kilver#0000
No joke. I have 24 eggs.


[12/14/2022 3:27 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I believe it. You damn near have an entire village of CCs


[12/14/2022 3:27 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Gonna have to reserve an entire sub-division for you


[12/14/2022 3:27 PM] Kilver#0000
Still nothing compared to @ScoobieSnaccs


[12/14/2022 3:28 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I cant even imagine


[12/14/2022 3:28 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Probably have more CCs than I do NFTs


[12/14/2022 3:28 PM] Kilver#0000
I think he has somewhere between 250-300 CCs don’t remember exactly


[12/14/2022 3:30 PM] Kilver#0000
What’s a man to do with all that power?


[12/14/2022 4:01 PM] CM Mongo#0000

[12/14/2022 4:08 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Believe it would burn the older one and create a new one as nft metadata can’t be directly changed ? I may be mistaken


[12/14/2022 4:09 PM] Kilver#0000
Well it depends if the serum is intended to work as a cosmetic ingame or actually change the NFT itself.


[12/14/2022 4:10 PM] Kilver#0000
I know you technically have to mint a new one in the second scenario. But that would make serums a lot more valuable.


[12/14/2022 9:16 PM] ihunt86#0000
@Kilver @Sisyphuspush  here is what ther serums do per the white paper. Looks to be a whole new NFT that is mutated

[12/14/2022 9:18 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Im wondering if it burns the old one though


[12/14/2022 9:19 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
or creates a new one based off original


[12/14/2022 9:20 PM] Kilver#0000
That’s quite exciting.


[12/14/2022 9:20 PM] Kilver#0000
I might prioritize serums then.


[12/14/2022 9:20 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Curious to see a mutated monkey, but at the same time dont want to ruin it if I dont like mutation. Conversely, I dont want to use on a "regular" one and it be badass and be left wishing I used it on a monkey....Just means I need to buy more and experiment some, I suppose


[12/14/2022 9:21 PM] ihunt86#0000
i would think you would want to mutate your less rare CC.


[12/14/2022 9:21 PM] ihunt86#0000
but i guess it will depend on how it all works out


[12/14/2022 9:22 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Monkey with horns sounds🔥


[12/14/2022 9:22 PM] Kilver#0000
Yeah. You want to make your common CCs more special


[12/14/2022 9:22 PM] ihunt86#0000
the body parts are also a little confusing not sure how that will play out or how rare they really are


[12/14/2022 9:22 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
You are probably right. I need to focus on getting 1st serum 1st


[12/14/2022 9:23 PM] ihunt86#0000
it think the body parts will be cool once you find your main character you can upgrade him all the way


[12/14/2022 9:23 PM] ihunt86#0000
i think the body parts will be cool once you find your main character you can upgrade him all the way

Where's the update


[12/19/2022 8:49 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
On our discord in the announcement channel. We will post medium article today.


[12/19/2022 8:49 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
**ANOTHER UPDATE IS HERE!**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:newMap:  **CITY MAP - 95%**
Since the last update, we added some cool glow effects and darker shades to the city. In the upcoming update we hope to fix more bugs on the city map such as collisions or seeing your character front of roofs.

🔒 **CONNECTING WALLET - 50% **
We found our new solution for verifying NFT ownership after opening the game. We had to use different method which is more secure than from our previous game called "Cyberdino". More information about the solution after it's finished. 

🗃️ **DATABASE &  LEADERBOARD FOR BARMAN JOB  MINI-GAME TO INTEGRATE EARNING FEATURE - 0%**
After we finish connecting wallet, we are ready to start implementing leaderboard with important information for possible earning while playing barman job.

:590: **MARKETPLACE - 50% **
Demo UI is fully finished. Our next step will be implementing Skyharbor dApp to allow players buy NFTs from the game.

🗺️  **MAP & MINIMAP**
We also added minimap & map with also street names to better locate yourself and places.
There are features such as close minimap, open map on the fullscreen, ZOOM IN/OUT, FULL map (it zooms out the map into fullscreen) and also button that will show you your location on the map.

🎮 **ALPHA RELEASE**
There have been a number of delays, but we are nearing the alpha release date.  Expecting alpha release date announcement in the next update.

🎅 **ONGOING CHRISTMAS AUDIONFT AIRDROP EVENT**
We launched a new event where all CyberCitizens holders are eligible to receive an airdrop of FREE Christmas audioNFT after they qualify their address in
our #airdrop room. The event is still live till 22th December 2022.

:Ergopad: **ERGOPAD AUDIONFT AIRDROP**
Today, we airdropped 7 NFTs (CyberCitizens & CyberEggs) to random IDO participants that were contributing in <clipped message>


[12/19/2022 8:50 AM] Thirdstryker#0000

[12/19/2022 8:51 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000

Fun get together! I enjoyed it very much!


[12/19/2022 8:40 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Wish I could have stayed for it all


[12/19/2022 10:28 PM] dumbgenx#0000
Damn, I was out of the house and missed it


[12/19/2022 10:29 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
You can also play it (it was recorded) 🙂 + we will be also on ergogames livestream in a few days 🔥


[12/19/2022 10:30 PM] Kilver#0000
More too look forward to! Woo!


[12/20/2022 4:22 AM] theta_decay#0000
Nice job, I enjoyed it. Thanks for hosting.


[12/20/2022 12:11 PM] Kilver#0000
Sup’ friendos!


[12/20/2022 12:36 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Good morning, sir


[12/20/2022 12:39 PM] Kilver#0000
How are you today?


[12/20/2022 12:40 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Doing good, thanks. Gotta lot of hokiday stuff to do today


[12/20/2022 12:40 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
How the day treating you so far?


[12/20/2022 1:33 PM] Kilver#0000
Not bad. Went to have a blood test and went to the dentist so all the unpleasantries are out of the way.


[12/20/2022 2:37 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
The dentist is enough in and of itself. Probably one of my biggest fears...yeah,  good to get that taken care of early


[12/20/2022 4:20 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Oof remembe when I was small was getting a cavity removed and the dentist froze me up and I could still feel the drill drilling into my teeth and dude didnt believe me and just kept going 🤷‍♂️


[12/20/2022 4:45 PM] Kilver#0000
Damn. I do not enjoy going to the dentist even now.


[12/20/2022 4:55 PM] Tudor CT | Proxies#0000
Hey, Thanks for the appreciation! see you on next time. our Target date is 7 Jan. (wanted to do a couple in between but the holidays are in the way.


[12/20/2022 5:19 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
(re  : *<CM Mongo> Oof remembe when I was small was getting a cavity removed and the dentist froze me up and I could still feel the drill drilling into my teeth and dude didnt believe me and just kept going 🤷‍♂️*) 
 
 Some of my worst life experiences happened in a dentist chair. Anything more than a cleaning now, I'm getting sedated


[12/20/2022 6:12 PM] Kilver#0000
Quick question about the minting rewards. Is it possible that not all rewards will be won by the time all the Citizens will be minted? Or is it a guarantee that they will be minted and if there are 100 citizens left to mint and 100 rewards left that will make the rewards ratio 100%?


[12/20/2022 9:15 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
We will make sure all rewards are distributed during wave3. 🙂


[12/20/2022 9:16 PM] Kilver#0000
Ok fair enough. XD I’m sure you will figure out a fair system or something.


[12/20/2022 9:18 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I see Cyberverse collections in trending again at skyharbor 👀


[12/20/2022 9:18 PM] Kilver#0000
Yeah who else but Quag-lver


[12/20/2022 9:19 PM] Kilver#0000
I got 2 apartments and I’m dying to pop my large apartment virginity but the owner of apartment 79 won’t reach out to me to hear my offer.


[12/20/2022 9:45 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
It’s a bit difficult imo, since there are owners of some Cyberverse NFTs that haven’t joined our discord yet


[12/20/2022 9:45 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
But wish you luck to find the owner and discuss your offer 😁


[12/20/2022 10:16 PM] Kilver#0000
I  hope someone answers eventually. 😁


[12/21/2022 4:43 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
I’ll sell you #0 for your kidneys 😂😂😂😂


[12/21/2022 7:08 AM] Kilver#0000
Damn you would be ripped off. They had a though time while I was in my late teens.


[12/21/2022 10:46 AM] snoobdog#0000
@Kilver I wrote you a dm


[12/21/2022 4:22 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
wish you luck!


[12/21/2022 4:22 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
hey all!


[12/21/2022 4:22 PM] Kilver#0000
Hey!


[12/21/2022 4:23 PM] Kilver#0000
What are you up to?


[12/21/2022 4:24 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
just got home from the work 😁  breehze will also finally come home today, so we will be airdropping the audionfts for IDO participants today. The ones I promised to airdrop 2 days ago 😅


[12/21/2022 4:25 PM] Kilver#0000
That’s cool! Looking forward to hearing it!


[12/21/2022 4:26 PM] Kilver#0000
Should we be worried about SH not being able to pay their bills?


[12/21/2022 4:27 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
i dont think so


[12/21/2022 4:27 PM] Kilver#0000
Oke. Anyway I donated 20 Erg to the raffle.


[12/21/2022 4:28 PM] Kilver#0000
The bear market is taking its toll on everyone.


[12/21/2022 4:29 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
for real


[12/21/2022 4:42 PM] Kilver#0000
Btw what’s left to mint?


[12/21/2022 4:42 PM] Kilver#0000
😁


[12/21/2022 6:14 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
will check later and make a full list


[12/21/2022 6:14 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
no idea honestly, last few days were spent mainly to handle connector issue for the game + irl job


[12/21/2022 6:15 PM] Kilver#0000
No worries. Just curious.


[12/21/2022 6:17 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
things are looking good tho 😁


[12/22/2022 4:17 AM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#0000
@Kilver you forgot that I had a large apartment that we could discuss


[12/22/2022 7:53 AM] Kilver#0000
That is true.


[12/22/2022 1:32 PM] Kilver#0000
@Mr.Pixel hey boss! I remember reading in the old White Paper about being able to have mining rigs in the apartments to earn CYPX. Did that idea get scrapped or is still something you are considering?


[12/22/2022 1:43 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Its still a thing, we just didnt add it to the whitepaper.


[12/22/2022 1:44 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
There’s a lot of things we plan and they aren’t in the whitepaper


[12/22/2022 1:47 PM] Kilver#0000
Oh wow! That’s really existing to hear!   I always thought that was such a great idea!


[12/22/2022 1:47 PM] Kilver#0000
Oh wow! That’s really exciting to hear!   I always thought that was such a great idea!


[12/22/2022 1:49 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
How much will apartment mints be?


[12/22/2022 3:55 PM] Kilver#0000
The next apartment mints have not been disclosed yet. My guess is that it might happen after the game goes live.


[12/22/2022 6:17 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Oof, suppos eto have like 20-30cm of snow today


[12/22/2022 6:19 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
we don't have specific number of mints yet, but there will be next mint sometimes after the game goes live, like Kilver said


[12/22/2022 8:08 PM] Chioz#0000
Is there an event happening now?

[12/23/2022 12:12 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
For those who were watching the stream what are you the most excited about? 👀


[12/23/2022 12:12 AM] Kilver#0000
The jobs. Definitely


[12/23/2022 12:14 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Love to hear that. Once the game is launched we will be focusing on adding more jobs and balance the game mechanics with the community feedback


[12/23/2022 12:14 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Bro....game looks amazing


[12/23/2022 12:15 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Just how much you all have done...the possibility of multi-player, and bartending...were they mixing the drinks before serving?


[12/23/2022 12:15 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
about apartments, i started working on new furniture and fix the old one so it can be added when we get time (hopefully after launch)

[12/23/2022 12:44 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Appreciate that!  
The version of the game is still in the early stages, but all the features that you could see on the stream will be ready for the launch date. 🔥


[12/23/2022 12:45 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
we had to improvise😂


[12/23/2022 12:47 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
Where can I see stream


[12/23/2022 12:48 AM] Thirdstryker#0000

[12/23/2022 12:50 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
i will try to get a recorded version from ergogames team and try to post our part probably on youtube asap. (it may take a day, if they record the stream)

[12/23/2022 1:11 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000

[12/23/2022 10:55 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Wel it’s back, seemed to just flicker for a bit


[12/23/2022 10:56 AM] Kilver#0000
Is it like a warning or something?


[12/23/2022 10:56 AM] Kilver#0000
Or just random storm?


[12/23/2022 11:02 AM] slapshottwelve#0000

Hey all


[12/23/2022 12:23 PM] Kilver#0000
Heya!


[12/23/2022 12:24 PM] Kilver#0000
Damn, by the end of the stream it was 3am in Poland. 😆 I was almost falling asleep.


[12/23/2022 12:24 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Morning all


[12/23/2022 12:25 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
1-2 am was here 😁 Hopefully there is also recorded version of the stream so I could upload our part on YouTube for those who couldn’t watch it. I asked Obrien about it, but he’s probably sleeping


[12/23/2022 12:26 PM] Kilver#0000
That’s a good idea! Probably an edited version would be a good idea.XD


[12/23/2022 12:27 PM] Kilver#0000
That’s a good idea! Probably an edited version would be a good idea also.XD


[12/23/2022 2:59 PM] Kilver#0000

[12/23/2022 3:01 PM] Kilver#0000

[12/23/2022 3:10 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Wow it is like so windy , 130km/hr gusts


[12/23/2022 3:10 PM] CM Mongo#0000

[12/23/2022 4:48 PM] Kilver#0000
My guy, the new Neon Riders track is flames! 🔥 well done!


[12/23/2022 7:21 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Honestly the fact that my power is still up is astounding to me


[12/24/2022 4:34 AM] Samish#0000
I did not get the audio drop yet.  Is it still in progress


[12/24/2022 7:24 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Were you participating in the ido staker and seed round ?


[12/24/2022 7:24 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
The Christmas audio NFTs haven’t been airdropped yet


[12/24/2022 7:27 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Morning all!


[12/24/2022 8:14 AM] Samish#0000
No, I did not do the IDO, I thought the Christmas audio was sent.


[12/24/2022 8:51 AM] Kilver#0000
What has the Neon Riders track dropped for? I don’t remember.


[12/24/2022 9:14 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Ido! 🙂


[12/24/2022 9:15 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Christmas track might be sent today. Don’t worry


[12/24/2022 9:15 AM] Kilver#0000
Care to share? 😆


[12/24/2022 1:32 PM] Kilver#0000
Oh IDO not I do XD took me a few hours but I got you.


[12/24/2022 5:32 PM] Gogo#0000

Also, rarity score needs to be higher to be rarer?


[12/24/2022 5:42 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Lower! , although I’ve seen some cybercitizens that would be considered not rare , rarity value wise but they still look super cool lol


[12/24/2022 7:17 PM] Kilver#0000
@ERGOGO Dude you got a fricking robot!? Damn! #4 congrats!


[12/24/2022 7:18 PM] Kilver#0000
@ERGOGO Dude you got a fricking robot!? Or are you just checking random citizens?


[12/24/2022 7:22 PM] Gogo#0000
LOL! Didnt notice everyone can see what I checked XD


[12/24/2022 7:22 PM] Gogo#0000
Just checking btw, got 3 males


[12/24/2022 7:22 PM] Gogo#0000
best one 930 rarity


[12/24/2022 7:24 PM] Kilver#0000
Ah, that’s ok, rarity is not crazy important. Some of my favorite looking ones are around 1500/2081.


[12/24/2022 7:24 PM] Gogo#0000
You got any interesting?

That’s what my girlfriend’s grandad calls a shot glass. I estimate is around 100ml. He pours some exotic spirits he collected over the years like this tea based one in the glass. I have no Idea what it is but it burns.

[12/27/2022 5:05 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
all it takes is one gnome to drop his collection on fire sale 🔥


[12/27/2022 5:06 PM] Kilver#0000
So one holder decided to sale a few of his gnomes.


[12/27/2022 5:13 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
I think a few was ~30 liquidated. some of which seemed like long term holds


[12/27/2022 5:14 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
then fomo kicked in lol


[12/27/2022 5:24 PM] Kilver#0000
I can’t differentiate between rare gnomes and common ones so I just stay out of it. I burned myself with an angel that I played way too much for.


[12/27/2022 7:12 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
yea angels are tough gotta look up tiers each time.  you ever check ergnome website? series 1,2,3 gnomes are pretty easy to distinguish just based on the background.  the custom ones and promos are tougher to value

[12/27/2022 7:14 PM] Kilver#0000
Yes I saw this chart long ago, as you said there are a lot of new ones that I can’t distinguish.


[12/27/2022 7:15 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
yea and its always had one of the higher floors too. so like you said could pay alot for the wrong one


[12/27/2022 7:25 PM] CM Mongo#0000

a lot of what we plan we’ll have the community vote on I believe


[12/27/2022 7:49 PM] Kilver#0000
Any idea on what the majority will need to be to pass such an implementation?


[12/27/2022 7:50 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Hmm not sure yet


[12/27/2022 7:52 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Ingame polling system would be cool , can submit one vote per cc you own for voting power or something , just a random thought lol


[12/27/2022 7:56 PM] Kilver#0000
@Lgmeister already implemented a goat voter. You can talk to him about it! 😁


[12/27/2022 8:21 PM] CM Mongo#0000

[12/27/2022 8:23 PM] Kilver#0000

I think having special characters to prove your an OG is a good idea.


[12/27/2022 11:26 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Well, the proposal will actually contain benefits for gen1, there is only a few changes - mainly for the nft name. NO MORE SPOILERS TILL ITS ANNOUNCED 😂

we actually wanted to start the proposal before wave3, but decided to wait till the game is launched

Ooh, I can check that out


[12/28/2022 10:07 PM] Kilver#0000
Oh mate… 0% royalties for Ergo Pixels… that sucks.


[12/28/2022 10:09 PM] CM Mongo#0000
haha yeah, our first collection , lessons were learned


[12/28/2022 10:12 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
well some ergopixels were minted almost 500 days ago  😁  it was way before you could mint nfts with royalties, but I don't recommend anyone to buy ergopixels because of the ergopixel nft's "age"

Oooh yeah, that was way back


[12/28/2022 10:14 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
yah, way back when i was minting all 250 nfts manually 😂


[12/28/2022 10:14 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Fun times, and spooky founders lol


[12/28/2022 10:14 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I think it took me 2 whole days - don't remember


[12/28/2022 10:14 PM] Kilver#0000
I see… it’s the same with Ergoats Gen 0, it broke my heart when I first found out that lgmeister is not making any money off them. 😓


[12/28/2022 10:15 PM] CM Mongo#0000
lots of the devs I’ve seen are in it for the long run I feel


[12/28/2022 10:16 PM] Kilver#0000
I don’t want to be the devil’s advocate but imagine if Ergo Pixels are taking off like Crypto Punks one day…


[12/28/2022 10:17 PM] CM Mongo#0000
hahaha , well could be possible , there’s also only 250 so they’re pretty rare , but yeah bummer on no royalties if that were  to happen


[12/28/2022 10:19 PM] Kilver#0000
If they would be playable characters you could still profit from them.


[12/28/2022 10:19 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
there are many obstacles with the current ergopixels collection


[12/28/2022 10:19 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
for integrating them into the game as a playable characters


[12/28/2022 10:24 PM] Kilver#0000
I’m not even going to pretend I understand what the implications are.


[12/29/2022 7:55 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Who’s buying all those ergopixels lol


[12/29/2022 7:56 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Pretty sure I know who got that goat.


[12/29/2022 7:56 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I'm holding off until an Ergonaut becomes available.


[12/29/2022 7:57 PM] CM Mongo#0000
a fair bit of the people who bought ergopixels I feel like have gone mia


[12/29/2022 7:58 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
That would be unfortunate


[12/29/2022 7:58 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Hopefully they come back though haha


[12/29/2022 8:00 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

another game update very soon


[12/29/2022 8:00 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Stops being a trend once it becomes a weekly occurance, LOL


[12/29/2022 8:01 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Minted a couple more CCs the other day


[12/29/2022 8:02 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
it was supposed to be yesterday, but i've been waiting for something  to show you all in the upcoming update...


[12/29/2022 8:02 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Still no luck with eggs and such, but I think I have all the audios now


[12/29/2022 8:07 PM] Kilver#0000
A goat was purchased? Wonder who that could be.


[12/29/2022 8:07 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
bro 😂


[12/29/2022 8:07 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Congrats on the successful hunt


[12/29/2022 8:08 PM] Kilver#0000
Yeah me and the seller agreed on a price yesterday


[12/29/2022 8:08 PM] Kilver#0000
Ty


[12/29/2022 8:15 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Was reading above about Pixels being used in game...QQ...how difficult would it be to use serums on Pixels and have them just made into a new CC?


[12/29/2022 8:16 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
And either burn original Pixel or put a 1 time cap on using serum per Pixel


[12/29/2022 8:25 PM] Kilver#0000
Or ban the pixels from interacting with serums


[12/29/2022 8:41 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
well all 250 were hand-drawn, what do you think? 🤣

I also bought B Cooper because he was cheap and I also have a man crush on him.


[12/29/2022 8:50 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
we will see. Like I mentioned, there will be a proposal and a discussion about the ergopixels (gen1)  🙂

[12/30/2022 1:35 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
I don't think it would make sense to have pixels using serums, already unique


[12/30/2022 4:33 AM] 3rd#0000
who bought Aayan, looks cool lol


[12/30/2022 4:46 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
I gotta grab myself a pixel


[12/30/2022 4:46 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Won’t be home til Jan 19 to make any purchases tho


[12/30/2022 4:54 AM] 3rd#0000
shrek for 700 erg wow lol


[12/30/2022 7:19 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Who wants CC #0 for the their first born child, kidneys and left foot? 😂


[12/30/2022 7:19 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Final offer


[12/30/2022 9:44 AM] Kilver#0000
I don’t think you can manage to sell it in these market conditions.


[12/30/2022 10:48 AM] Kilver#0000
What are you realistically looking to get for it?


[12/30/2022 10:56 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
I'd just keep it, it's a long term investment


[12/30/2022 11:48 AM] Kilver#0000
Agreed. That’s a good sale to a future ergo whale that won’t mind dropping 1k+ erg on an NFT


[12/30/2022 11:49 AM] 3rd#0000
once game is released people will pay


[12/30/2022 12:01 PM] Kilver#0000
Hey anyone wants to update us on the minting situation and what’s left to mint?


[12/30/2022 12:14 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Will do as soon as i get home, I promise!

Oh don’t worry I will.


[12/30/2022 2:53 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Probably at least number 2 top sale on skyharbor as I believe it’s potentially the most valuable NFT on Ergo


[12/30/2022 2:53 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
So prob 2k+


[12/30/2022 2:54 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Yeah I won’t let it go for anything other than a big offer


[12/30/2022 3:02 PM] Kilver#0000
Yeah I doubt you will get that amount in a bear market. Even tho it would be the cheapest time to get it.


[12/30/2022 6:22 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Agreed.

No apartment got a common egg tho


[12/30/2022 7:11 PM] Kilver#0000
I can trade you a few eggs for it if you want.


[12/30/2022 7:11 PM] Kilver#0000
I have every egg except the rarest one


[12/30/2022 7:12 PM] exoticplug#0000

Geez that’s a lot of eggs 😂

Gratz on the 2 diamond ones, I only have 1


[12/30/2022 7:15 PM] Kilver#0000
But I do have 2 white ones


[12/30/2022 7:16 PM] exoticplug#0000
Thank you, gotta love the look of the diamond items. That’s sick wonder what the rarest egg looks like.


[12/30/2022 7:16 PM] Kilver#0000
Or what even comes out if it.

[12/30/2022 9:30 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
I'm holding back from buying because I want others to have an opportunity to get in. I don't want to play by myself


[12/30/2022 9:48 PM] Kilver#0000
Ah way to make me feel like an ass. 😂


[12/30/2022 11:19 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

[12/30/2022 11:20 PM] Kilver#0000
Exciting! 😯


[12/31/2022 9:39 AM] Kilver#0000
I’m planning to make a long Twitter post about the mint today and I noticed on the WP even tho you say there are 9 tiers of rarity you have 10 egg pictures. 🤔

[12/31/2022 12:53 PM] Kilver#0000

[12/31/2022 12:53 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
One of those is not used, I think.


[12/31/2022 12:53 PM] Kilver#0000

Today I will present to you a great opportunity to get your toes dipped into the world of Ergo NFTs. There is an ongoing mint for the @CyberVerse_io project and I think I would do everyone a disservice by not talking about it. So I will write a thread about it. 1/12

[12/31/2022 1:09 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
WAs in the process of doing so. Nice overview


[12/31/2022 1:09 PM] Kilver#0000
Thank you for your support friend!


[12/31/2022 1:11 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
You made me fomo into another mint.... got my first monkey and legendary egg!

[12/31/2022 1:14 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Me making you FOMO is making me FOMO...dammit


[12/31/2022 1:15 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
I had also fomo 3 times prior with nothing so.... hopefully that helps


[12/31/2022 1:16 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I have succumbed to my FOMO 3 times during this mint already, LOL. Gonna have to sell some NFTs to mint more


[12/31/2022 1:21 PM] Kilver#0000
@Mr.Pixel is there a hint towards what one of the serums will look like? The rainbow one has the word Gnome in it. Is it just an easter egg or a future hint?


[12/31/2022 1:21 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
Just think of how many mints you can buy when you sell @Kilver cc 1575!

[12/31/2022 1:25 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
Its hard not to sell the 2 I minted but i think these will be OP once the game is out


[12/31/2022 1:26 PM] Kilver#0000
I’m very curious to see the serums in action.


[12/31/2022 1:27 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
LOL...10...exactly 10


[12/31/2022 1:28 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Need to get me one of those rainbow serums tto


[12/31/2022 1:28 PM] Thirdstryker#0000

[12/31/2022 1:30 PM] $nicnac#0000

hey!


[12/31/2022 1:34 PM] Xur#0000
I have an apartment and a bunch of cyber citizens. Can we stake them or anything yet?


[12/31/2022 1:36 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Not staking yet. But the game release should be finally in January. We ran on some issues which delayed the game launch a lot... What to expect in the early version is barman job minigame, early customizing apartments, ergopixel paints added as well, whole new map version and many more... please check out previous updates and clips in #📃┃announcements and #updates  rooms. Today we will be announcing another update of the game.


[12/31/2022 1:41 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
Sounds sick!!

Citizens, it’s been new years in Poland already! I wish you a happy new year! Even if this year will not bring us wealth, it will bring us one more year of development and one more year of us together, and that’s enough for me! I can say I enjoyed your company and I hope one day when we all make it we will organize a big get together! ❤️🎉


[12/31/2022 11:59 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000

Noobie question: is teh claim to the artist royalties before or after hatching the egg?


[01/01/2023 9:29 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000

[01/01/2023 6:19 PM] ProtoSuckaPunk#0000
Still minting?  The mobile 'mint' button does nothing when pressed, fyi,  and there is a wallet address on site but no amount listed? Thoughts?


[01/01/2023 6:21 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
We recommend to use pc for minting.

Hello guys. What was the mint price for cyber citizens and how many have been minted ?


[01/06/2023 1:57 PM] Kilver#0000
20 Erg to mint 1 citizen and probably <500 left to mint.


[01/06/2023 1:59 PM] Mr Robot#0000
Thanks


[01/06/2023 2:25 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Some whale gonna come and buy em out

If Ergo gets adoption cybercitizen floor gonna moon


[01/06/2023 2:31 PM] Kilver#0000
Yeah. 10000 erg to buy the rest of the 500 citizens. Pocket change for a whale.


[01/06/2023 2:41 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Sounds insane but is really only a little over 10 grand


[01/06/2023 2:42 PM] Kilver#0000
11.600$ as of this second

Like on SkyHarbor? It’s whatever the seller is willing to sell it at.


[01/06/2023 6:49 PM] Gogo#0000
Yeah but i suppose you cant set the price lower than the floor price correct?


[01/06/2023 6:51 PM] Kilver#0000
If you minted your citizen for 20 erg and you need to sell it as fast as possible you can ask  for 19-15 erg. You can list it for 1 erg if you want.


[01/06/2023 7:23 PM] ckjchambers#0000
Been away a long time, but pop in every now and then. Great to see the project nominated for so many catgories in the awards


[01/06/2023 7:27 PM] ckjchambers#0000
I went through and voted for you guys in quite a few and the Walrus Dao in a couple of the catagories


[01/06/2023 7:54 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
Its not calculated. Literally just the lowest priced nft for sale in that collection.


[01/06/2023 8:21 PM] Gogo#0000
Thanks


[01/07/2023 2:02 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Yeah I think with adoption floor prices will matter more. They’re talked about a lot on Cardano

Bruh, I just wanted to grab a 150 dollar gift card from McDonald’s , they charged me 150 but my gift card has 100 dollars on it 😅

150$ McDonald’s gift card? Never knew they do such things.

oh no , can use it as much as you want up till it’s out , just a bit annoying you can’t use it on the app to order online lol

[01/09/2023 12:00 PM] CC#1982#0000
Do you think the up-trend will continue for a while, or do think it'll go down some more?


[01/09/2023 12:04 PM] Kilver#0000
I would not get bullish until we see the next 2-3 CPI reports coming in lower. On the 12th we get the CPI data for December and if we see anything under 6.9% we can expect some green in the markets. I would still be a bit pessimistic for the first half of 2023 until we see a clear downturn in inflation.


[01/09/2023 12:05 PM] Kilver#0000
We are down from 9.1% to 7.1% but that needs to carry on.


[01/09/2023 12:08 PM] CC#1982#0000
For sure!
I'm sitting here watching the crypto market go a bit up and people are already on the Hype train. 
Might be a bit pessimistic, but I doubt this sudden up-trend will hold.


[01/09/2023 12:11 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Good morning all


[01/09/2023 12:12 PM] Kilver#0000
In all honesty crypto has been lagging behind the futures market. Gold and silver have been in a uptrend since September last year. So some green in crypto was overdue.


[01/09/2023 12:12 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I'm hoping it stays bearish til Sept


[01/09/2023 12:12 PM] CC#1982#0000
September you say, how come?


[01/09/2023 12:13 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Still some more bad actors to shake out, I'm poor and need the time, and I think it would give time for a lot of Dapps to get online and working


[01/09/2023 12:14 PM] CC#1982#0000
Oh, I've not been comparing Silver and Gold with crypto. 
But yeah, It makes some sense then.


[01/09/2023 12:14 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Want to see things like Duckpools, nightowl, blitz, etc to be up before next bull hits


[01/09/2023 12:15 PM] CC#1982#0000
Ah I see, in that case I'd like some more of that down-trend again :OMEGALOL:


[01/09/2023 12:24 PM] Kilver#0000
Date staring 10 Oct 2022. The Dollar strength index inflected down and silver and gold inflecting up. Could be a sign of things turning around but you never know for sure.

I really wish the inverse Cramer index was a real thing, we would all be rich in 2022.


[01/09/2023 12:37 PM] Chuck#0000
then we would have an inverse Cramer index bubble


[01/09/2023 12:38 PM] Chuck#0000
the super bubble


[01/09/2023 12:38 PM] Chuck#0000

[01/10/2023 8:20 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
They’re creating a game ^


[01/10/2023 8:27 AM] Cass#0000
Does this game have its own token or do most use $EGIO


[01/10/2023 8:29 AM] 3rd#0000
own token $CYPX


[01/10/2023 8:32 AM] 3rd#0000
in game currency


[01/10/2023 8:32 AM] Cass#0000
Right, cool. Does it have staking mech yet?


[01/10/2023 8:37 AM] Cass#0000
I’m partly lost why/what $egio does, or what it’s future utility is, if it is not the token used for ergo games, anyone know?


[01/10/2023 8:37 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
The characters have s staking mechanism


[01/10/2023 8:49 AM] Kilver#0000
Staking EGIO comes in different tiers and rewards.

[01/10/2023 8:52 AM] Kilver#0000
With cybercitizens you can stake the NFTs themselves in-game, and the more you level up the NFT characters the higher the reward in CYPX is. With CYPX you would be able to buy a lot of in-game items or exchange it for Ergo on Spectrum.


[01/10/2023 8:53 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
@Kilver you can stake the actual NFTs?

[01/10/2023 10:16 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
Lower mire rare


[01/10/2023 10:17 AM] Cass#0000
and second number is just mint number out of 2081


[01/10/2023 10:17 AM] Kilver#0000
There are certain traits that are rarer than others. Like there are like 3 times more males than females. That would increase the rarity. Certain clothing items or hairstyles do the same thing. There are 2081 citizens and 462 is the rank of that citizen compared to the others.


[01/10/2023 10:19 AM] Kilver#0000
High rarity score is good, low rank is good. But in terms of value. People like a clean looking NFT as well.


[01/10/2023 10:21 AM] Kilver#0000
Females will have a higher rarity score than most males but they might not look as good as some males ones.


[01/10/2023 10:22 AM] Cass#0000
its rather confusing here is why.. you might be able to clarify... 🙂


[01/10/2023 10:23 AM] Cass#0000
high rarity score, but high rank.

[01/10/2023 10:25 AM] Cass#0000
i would expect the monkey to have a might higher rarity score based of what you said..


[01/10/2023 10:25 AM] Kilver#0000
No,  I’m wrong.


[01/10/2023 10:25 AM] Kilver#0000
Higher rarity score is apparently worse.


[01/10/2023 10:25 AM] 3rd#0000
correct


[01/10/2023 10:26 AM] Kilver#0000
Sorry confused myself.


[01/10/2023 10:26 AM] 3rd#0000

my favorite is actually not rare at all, rare hair but rest is simple


[01/10/2023 10:28 AM] Kilver#0000
2 random examples where I would personally pay more for the one that is technically less rare. I would pay more for the male one because is cleaner, rather than the better ranked female one.

Both look sick


[01/10/2023 10:39 AM] Kilver#0000
Got this guy 2 months ago. Highest Citizen sale to date. I think his rank is 1300+ or something like that.

there are a lot undervalued


[01/10/2023 10:52 AM] Kilver#0000
I think there are only around 80 monkeys out there. I might be wrong. That makes them quite rare.


[01/10/2023 10:56 AM] Cass#0000
yep 80

On the NFT I think the hat is white. But in-game is black. Which one you guys prefer?


[01/10/2023 11:34 AM] Ninjah#0000
On this one , black


[01/10/2023 11:34 AM] 3rd#0000

Yeah as I thought


[01/10/2023 11:35 AM] Kilver#0000
I had a Citizen with the detective hat and I noticed then.


[01/10/2023 11:36 AM] Kilver#0000
I think is the same with the pink hair. It looks white on the NFT.


[01/10/2023 11:37 AM] Kilver#0000
Certain ones.


[01/10/2023 2:12 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Good morning Citizens!


[01/10/2023 2:14 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
You all been killing the Ergo NFT Awards voting! Amazing to see the Cyberverse community support the project and what the team has accomplished thus far!


[01/10/2023 2:23 PM] Kilver#0000
Pff, I’m disappointed it was so close with the Angels. 😤


[01/10/2023 2:38 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Yeah, some of the votes so far have surprised me a bit.


[01/10/2023 2:40 PM] Kilver#0000
Is the voting still on?


[01/10/2023 2:40 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Its open through end of month.


[01/10/2023 2:41 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
People arent around on a daily basis as much and wanted to ensure as much of the community as possible had a chance to vote


[01/10/2023 2:41 PM] Kilver#0000
Ok. I need to have a word with my ergoat fam


[01/10/2023 2:43 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Please do! Figured they would have a stronger showing in the favorite community vote.


[01/10/2023 5:13 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Does anyone have the Rush, Danger Zone, or Electric Clouds audioNFTs?


[01/10/2023 5:19 PM] Cass#0000
I think I might have rush, let me check


[01/10/2023 5:49 PM] Kilver#0000
Yes, yes and yes.


[01/10/2023 5:50 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000

[01/10/2023 5:53 PM] Kilver#0000
Yeah I have 1 of each. What are you offering?


[01/10/2023 5:53 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I do


[01/10/2023 5:54 PM] Gogo#0000
Very cool one, very clean


[01/10/2023 5:54 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
What do you offer the man who has everything CC related?


[01/10/2023 5:54 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Thank you


[01/10/2023 5:56 PM] Kilver#0000
Dunno…  did you look on SH?


[01/10/2023 5:56 PM] Kilver#0000
Some of them are not that expensive


[01/10/2023 5:57 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000

How did I not know they were listed under ErgoGames?


[01/10/2023 5:59 PM] Kilver#0000
Probably just missed the  drop. It was announced around that time.


[01/10/2023 5:59 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
That may explain why I am missing those in particular


[01/10/2023 5:59 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Those are the only ones listed under EGIO, though?


[01/10/2023 6:00 PM] Kilver#0000
Yes those 4 and some membership cards


[01/10/2023 6:00 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Ahhh


[01/10/2023 6:00 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
WAs reviewing the WP...again...and noticed I didt have those and was wondering how


[01/10/2023 6:01 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Yeah we did have a collab with egio where they released some


[01/10/2023 6:02 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
At least I can hear them on SH....Far too expensive for me RN though. Trying to stock up on CCs


[01/10/2023 6:05 PM] Kilver#0000
Fair. I would have not sold them cheap. XD


[01/10/2023 6:07 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
TBH, without the others on the market it was hard to even determine value. I was going to offer a purple egg for them but now see that would have been a lowball offer


[01/10/2023 6:07 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
And that was just because I want the entire collection and thought it wouldn't be too difficult


[01/10/2023 6:08 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Have to admit, these tracks hit though


[01/10/2023 6:09 PM] Kilver#0000
Well to put it in perspective, when I joined the Platinum tier 1mil EGIO was costing 1000$. So yeah…


[01/10/2023 6:09 PM] Kilver#0000
Now it would cost you 176$ XD


[01/10/2023 6:10 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Yikes!


[01/10/2023 6:10 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I think it should rebound nicely though. I like what the team is building and their approach to doing so

[01/10/2023 6:24 PM] Kilver#0000
Yeah it was quite addicting. It only had 1 stage and 1 map. You have to strategically use the gold you got from killing mobs to buy upgrades. But don’t use too much gold because the no of the mobs killed and the gold you got total you final score.


[01/10/2023 6:25 PM] Kilver#0000
I think this was my highest score.

[01/10/2023 6:26 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Is that your character or a default for testing?


[01/10/2023 6:27 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
It looked fun in the demo. I can see myself slinging some drinks


[01/10/2023 6:32 PM] Kilver#0000
No there were 2 others. But I enjoyed this one the most.


[01/10/2023 6:32 PM] Kilver#0000
I can’t want! 👀


[01/11/2023 4:06 AM] 3rd#0000
I am still confused about the eggs. When we mint a citizen, we get 5% of all future sales (Artist Royalties). With eggs, the mint comes later. So if I sell the egg, do I get the 5% Artist Royalties? Or do I have to wait until after the egg mint to get the 5% Artist Royalties.


[01/11/2023 5:38 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Not sure what do you mean 😅


[01/11/2023 5:43 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
We have to hatch the eggs right? When we hatch the eggs, is that a mint?


[01/11/2023 5:43 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
You can sell the eggs prior to the hatch


[01/11/2023 5:44 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
Who keeps the Artist Royalties? I got the egg with minting the citizen, but if someone else hatches the egg after i sell it, who gets the Artist Royalties?


[01/11/2023 5:54 AM] Cass#0000
Wait, really, the minter get the royalties


[01/11/2023 5:54 AM] Cass#0000
Wait, really, the minter get the royalties?


[01/11/2023 5:55 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
As far as I understand it, everytime it is sold 5% goes to the minter


[01/11/2023 5:55 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
No😅  it goes to the artist (our minting wallet)


[01/11/2023 5:56 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
I see


[01/11/2023 5:57 AM] Cass#0000
That would be wild


[01/11/2023 6:17 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
It makes sense lol


[01/11/2023 6:57 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Where’d you see that haha


[01/11/2023 7:05 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
A friend who runs a nft platform on another chain said that is how his platform works, the minter is considered to be the artist. I thought it was universal but tbh I'm glad the team gets it, makes sense business wise and they deserve it


[01/11/2023 7:20 AM] Kilver#0000
Unless he plans to create and sell unlimited NFTs I don’t see how his project is sustainable financially. Unless it was just a 1 off collection so the minter royalties was a way to make sure it sell out and once he sold out he won’t do anything else with the project. In that case congrats to the minters that’s a great deal but it’s the first time I hear of such practices.


[01/11/2023 7:22 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
Interesting, thanks for the information 👍


[01/11/2023 7:47 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Minting wallet gets the royalties in most projects AFAIK


[01/11/2023 7:57 AM] Cass#0000
Correct, but I the founder/creator is the (first) minter in a way if you use something like ergauctions to mint it like a lot do


[01/11/2023 7:57 AM] Cass#0000

Yer thats true


[01/11/2023 7:58 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
Just saying what I was told, I think the setup here is good


[01/11/2023 8:00 AM] Kilver#0000
When the artist mints the whole collection from 1 wallet you have a way of verifying that what you buy is genuine. How does it work in the case of your friend?


[01/11/2023 8:01 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
I dont know, he runs the tokel project on KMD and the way he explained it to me is the minter gets the royalties unless I completely misunderstood


[01/11/2023 8:07 AM] Kilver#0000
Possibly you did not misunderstood, but I’m just trying to wrap my head around how it would work. 😅 I’m not very blockchain savvy myself so a lot of this are still alien to me.


[01/11/2023 8:08 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
Well when you mint it, your address is attached to the NFT


[01/11/2023 8:08 AM] Kilver#0000
Possibly you did not misunderstood, but I’m just trying to wrap my head around how it would work. 😅 I’m not very blockchain savvy myself so a lot of things are still alien to me.


[01/11/2023 8:08 AM] Kilver#0000
Yes but what stops me to mint a fake?  How would anyone know that mine is fake and yours is real? 😅


[01/11/2023 8:09 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
Not sure!


[01/11/2023 8:10 AM] Kilver#0000
When an artist mints a whole collection at the same time from the same wallet is pretty easy to see.


[01/11/2023 8:11 AM] Kilver#0000
Unless some advanced smart contract are involved in the whole deal. But I might just be reaching.


[01/11/2023 8:18 AM] Kilver#0000
I’m sure @Mr.Pixel or @CM Mongo can weigh in when they are up and about. I’m really curious now. 😁


[01/11/2023 8:31 AM] Cass#0000
Because only the wallet holder can mint, I could mint a fake right now of any project but it won’t be from the same addresses. 

So it won’t show up as part of the verified collection on SH


[01/11/2023 8:32 AM] Cass#0000

[01/11/2023 8:33 AM] Cass#0000
Only nfts minted from those address will show as verified, that’s why buying from verified collections on SC marketplaces is much safer than p2p trading

[01/11/2023 8:50 AM] Kilver#0000
Yes I understand how the normal one works. But in his friend’s case if he had 500 art pieces and he gave them to 500 different individuals for example I have to go and sort through 500 different wallet addresses to see if the one I’m buying is genuine. Yes something like SH will make sure that the NFT will be genuine before even being posted but I’m talking about other ways of trading.


[01/11/2023 8:52 AM] Cass#0000
Nah, he minted 500 under his address. That is the “mint adddress” and also were royalties go. 

What’s happens after that, where they go, doesn’t matter 🙂


[01/11/2023 8:52 AM] Cass#0000
Nah, he minted 500 under his address. That is the “mint adddress” you see in SH and also were royalties go.

[01/11/2023 8:54 AM] Kilver#0000
I’m not sure if you followed the conversation from the beginning, but he was saying that the minters get the royalties not the artist. How does that work?


[01/11/2023 8:55 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
it is possible i just misunderstood tbh


[01/11/2023 9:02 AM] Cass#0000
I could be wrong, but I’m 99% sure the confusion has came from thinking the “minter” is the person who brought the nft instead of the creator 🙂 

The SH smart contact simply pays out the royalty fee to the creator wallet


[01/11/2023 9:10 AM] Kilver#0000
I think you are right. I understood it as the artist sold the art to people who then were allowed to mint the pieces and get royalties from it.


[01/11/2023 9:13 AM] Kilver#0000
Thanks for clearing that up Cass! 🙏


[01/11/2023 9:20 AM] Cass#0000
No problem dude!


[01/11/2023 9:21 AM] Kilver#0000
@ZerD but now saying that. It could be possible that an artist mints 100 pieces on 100 different wallets and after he lists the collection on SH gives the possession of set wallets to buyers so they can collect the royalties?


[01/11/2023 9:26 AM] Cass#0000
Indeed that is possible, they buy the keys basically. A little hacky possible.

A better way I’m investigating on for my project on Cardano, is to have a service watch the royalties wallet and sales on chain. This service would then send a share of ADA to the original buyer.. 

This has some pretty funky use cases for things like (meta) land ownership 😅

That seems like a more streamlined way of doin it than my suggestion. XD


[01/11/2023 9:27 AM] Kilver#0000
Sounds cool!


[01/11/2023 9:27 AM] Cass#0000
Cardano you can set and change the royalties address for each sale  though, have not worked in a ergo contract heavily yet


[01/11/2023 9:28 AM] Cass#0000
Anyway high jacking the chat 🙂 wen game beta 🥹


[01/11/2023 9:28 AM] Kilver#0000
Yeah the Ergo smart contracts are quite strict from what I understand.


[01/11/2023 9:29 AM] Cass#0000

[01/11/2023 3:06 PM] Ninjah#0000
When is game release?


[01/11/2023 3:15 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
This month for beta testers


[01/11/2023 4:46 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Correct.


[01/11/2023 4:50 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
We are trying to finish our last extra updates in upcoming weeks so we could launch the game by the end of the month 🙂


[01/11/2023 4:53 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
Mint up y'all


[01/11/2023 4:53 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

I have not realized until now now much my CYPX is worth. XD


[01/11/2023 7:30 PM] Kilver#0000
I expect it to go down until the game is on the way buy I don’t ming I’m getting CYPX daily. 😎


[01/11/2023 7:31 PM] Kilver#0000
I expect it to go down until the game is out but I don’t ming I’m getting CYPX daily. 😎

Connect your wallet to https://www.ergopad.io

[01/11/2023 8:55 PM] Kilver#0000
I think is important to have some exposure to the main projects built on Ergo. ErgoPad I think is a must. It gives you the advantage on gettin in extremely early on some new projects  that come up. EGIO is very useful for exclusive gaming perks, early access to games and special drops. And CYPX because I love this project.


[01/11/2023 9:25 PM] Gogo#0000
Yeah, definitely


[01/12/2023 1:50 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
I personally am really bullish on Azorus. Can’t wait for th at one. With that being said, I have Ergopad, AHT and CYPX


[01/12/2023 1:52 AM] Cass#0000
Why azo?


[01/12/2023 1:52 AM] Cass#0000
Curious


[01/12/2023 1:56 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
I'm not really sure what it is tbh


[01/12/2023 2:18 AM] Cass#0000
Yea I’ve read it over a few times but still quite don’t understand it


[01/12/2023 2:55 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
A few reasons. They’re a data and analytics platform within UTXO. They’re going multi chain and provide valuable resources for not only big projects but smaller NFT projects as well. The founder is brilliant too imo


[01/12/2023 2:56 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
They have some videos on what they’re all about on YouTube


[01/12/2023 3:18 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
I'll probably invest, I kind of get it, and I see good progress. Why not 😂


[01/12/2023 6:35 AM] Cass#0000
Thanks I’ll check it out


[01/12/2023 9:02 AM] Kilver#0000
I was interested in Azorus but I have PTSd from investing in Palantir.

[01/12/2023 9:14 AM] Chuck#0000
I like the company still


[01/12/2023 9:23 AM] Kilver#0000
I do too but the price action did things to me that I’m only comfortable sharing with my therapist.


[01/12/2023 10:06 AM] Kilver#0000

There will be updated roadmap once we launch cyberverse. We have an expected launch date, but we will wait with this announcement, because every time I said expected date of the release, it got delayed due to other updates. 😅  
But I can tell you it's gonna be really soon. We are adding 2 features that weren't expected on the launch and I think you all will be excited about it + login UI and 3-4 more UI for the features, fixing 1 pretty annoying issue on the map and also securing game code.


[01/14/2023 4:45 PM] Thirdstryker#0000

[01/14/2023 5:15 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Welcome! Game launch is in a few weeks. Here an info what is going on in development 🦾


[01/14/2023 5:17 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
citizen -  playable character that allows access to the game
apartment - fully customized room (walls, floors, furniture), you can place also nfts on walls of your apartment that are supported (currently only ErgoPixels, more later)


[01/14/2023 5:48 PM] Kilver#0000
I saw @Benzel_ bought a CyberPet. What are those?


[01/14/2023 5:49 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Thats not our collection


[01/14/2023 5:49 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
We have only pixelated art for our game


[01/14/2023 5:50 PM] Kilver#0000

[01/14/2023 5:51 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
If it was ours, it would be in whitepaper.

[01/14/2023 5:56 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Not really sure, never used zelcore before. But I will ask around 🙂


[01/14/2023 5:59 PM] WakeBakeStake#0000

[01/14/2023 6:00 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

I thought it was part of the game but they just used similar naming convention. Still a cool modifyable nft so I’ll keep it haha


[01/14/2023 6:24 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Yes, sorry about that. Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do about it 😅


[01/14/2023 6:24 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
anyway how are you doing guys?


[01/14/2023 6:25 PM] Kilver#0000
Good! How about you?


[01/14/2023 6:26 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Pretty good! 🙂


[01/14/2023 6:29 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Right now I'm just checking new sprites for animations that we will use in the future. (Still in the works) 
It's a huge difference between the current one and the new one we've been working on 😄

 You can buy an egg, with that is a future pet


[01/14/2023 8:51 PM] Kilver#0000
Eternal egg on sale! 👀


[01/14/2023 8:53 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Can't wait to see what the pets are. Would be dope if Eternal were dragons or something.


[01/14/2023 8:54 PM] Kilver#0000
Yeah I’m curious too.


[01/14/2023 8:54 PM] Kilver#0000
Can’t afford one at the moment unfortunately.


[01/14/2023 8:54 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000

Why don’t you buy it then?


[01/14/2023 11:15 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
Hmmmmmlol


[01/15/2023 12:55 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
Pretty solid price for only 3 in existence


[01/15/2023 12:56 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
Is there enough space in your apartments @Kilver for a dragon?


[01/15/2023 5:29 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Will there be more apartments for mint?


[01/15/2023 7:45 AM] Kilver#0000
Form what I understand yes.


[01/15/2023 7:45 AM] Kilver#0000
I do have a large apartment. It should be enough.


[01/15/2023 7:55 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
I only have a middle.

(re  : *<Chuck> Are ergopixels going to be playable? 👀*) 
 
 Not at launch...possible community vote for it at a later date....possible


[01/15/2023 1:02 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Can be used to decorate apartments as posters though


[01/15/2023 1:04 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Yah, the utility for ergopixels at launch will be that you can put them on walls of your apartments. Later community vote as Sisy said


[01/15/2023 1:05 PM] Chuck#0000
That's super cool, might pick one up then


[01/15/2023 5:22 PM] Benzel_#6079
I might have to get a large apt if there’s a cheap one available. Need a summer home 😂😂


[01/15/2023 5:23 PM] Kilver#0000
Large ones are not cheap.


[01/15/2023 5:23 PM] Benzel_#0000
Welp, we in a recession lol housing market coming down eventually. 😂😂😂 I’ll be creeping like a vulture


[01/15/2023 5:25 PM] Kilver#0000
Maybe. I got mine for 250 erg and I saw one once sell for 187 erg.


[01/15/2023 5:25 PM] Benzel_#0000
Since there’s a bank I need FHA 😂😂


[01/15/2023 5:25 PM] Benzel_#0000
That’s a great price


[01/15/2023 5:26 PM] Benzel_#0000
I’d buy at 180-250ish  for sure


[01/15/2023 5:27 PM] Kilver#0000
Well I tracked down who owned it and negotiated it down to 250, wasn’t listed for 250.


[01/15/2023 5:28 PM] Benzel_#0000
Well I’m sure they are apart of this discord 😅 hopefully someone sees my comment we work something out


[01/15/2023 5:32 PM] Kilver#0000
You can post in trading if you want. Ask the owner to dm you


[01/15/2023 5:42 PM] Cass#0000
That estate floor 👀🔥


[01/15/2023 5:44 PM] Kilver#0000
Yeah I can see the apartments vanishing from the shop fairly easy.


[01/15/2023 5:46 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
65 for small and 215 for mid are nice floors


[01/15/2023 5:46 PM] Kilver#0000
I did buy myself an apartment whenever I saw a good offer.


[01/15/2023 5:47 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Saving large property purchases for if/when land or houses become available

[01/16/2023 10:26 AM] Samish#0000
They passed in Many categories.   The thing is I'm not seeing the popularity of that Walrus project in real time on Skyharbor.   The data does not match so someone is using IP spinner IMO


[01/16/2023 10:32 AM] Kilver#0000
Possible


[01/16/2023 10:33 AM] Samish#0000
It's funny... you said weird walrus thing


[01/16/2023 10:35 AM] Kilver#0000
It’s is a weird project that pops up on SH from time to time.


[01/16/2023 10:35 AM] Kilver#0000
Don’t know anything else about it


[01/16/2023 11:02 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
They have a connections to big cardano communities that voted


[01/16/2023 11:02 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
They have connections to big cardano communities that voted


[01/16/2023 11:05 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
As far as I know you don't even need an erg wallet to vote

Nope. No wallet is required to vote.


[01/16/2023 11:11 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000
They do have artists in their project that are popular on Cardano, so that is likely to be true.


[01/16/2023 11:14 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
The founder is popular in Cardano.


[01/16/2023 11:20 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I'm surprised you don't know much about them...should give it a look over sometime. Interesting project as far as potential.


[01/16/2023 11:21 AM] Kilver#0000
I’m not big on Caradano. But I will have a look at the project.


[01/16/2023 11:22 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Neither am I these days


[01/16/2023 11:23 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Basically its an NFT DAO and artists onbaoring project, in a nutshell


[01/16/2023 11:27 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
Skyharbor should do a similar contest based on sales! That would beef up activity, raise floors, and provide fees! I'm hoping they do another jpeg mania at least!


[01/16/2023 11:35 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Yeah, jpeg mania was a fun initiative. I'm sure the team has more up their sleeve once these major updates are released


[01/16/2023 12:21 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Yeah I enjoyed it and definitely bought NFTs because of the event


[01/16/2023 12:21 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Got rekt on the prizes tho 😂😂😂😂


[01/16/2023 6:02 PM] Chuck#0000
Does anyone know what this BFT project is, just got a random NFT in my wallet


[01/16/2023 6:02 PM] Kilver#0000
It’s a person sending them to everyone


[01/16/2023 6:03 PM] Kilver#0000

[01/16/2023 6:03 PM] Kilver#0000
Don’t know why.


[01/16/2023 6:03 PM] Kilver#0000
I don’t think anyone knows who he is.

[01/16/2023 6:46 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I have a decent amount of cyberxitizens. Will be buying soon more tho


[01/16/2023 6:48 PM] Kilver#0000
I’m getting 2600 CYPX a day from my vesting key. Pretty happy about that.


[01/16/2023 6:49 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
seeing the price of cypx makes me very happy


[01/16/2023 6:50 PM] Kilver#0000
I’m holding all my CYPX.


[01/16/2023 6:50 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
it's still higher than IDO price


[01/16/2023 6:50 PM] Kilver#0000
I sold some in the first 2 weeks because the price was ridiculous but I held everything since.


[01/16/2023 6:52 PM] Kilver#0000
Are holding some personal CYPX too?


[01/16/2023 7:00 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I have some. But not as many as I would like to have 😄


[01/16/2023 7:00 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I have some. But not as much as I would like to have 😄


[01/16/2023 7:01 PM] Gogo#0000
Where can i stake CYPX?


[01/16/2023 7:02 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
there is no staking for cypx


[01/16/2023 7:03 PM] Kilver#0000
You can’t. ErgoPad stakers got in on CYPX early but we are getting all of it daily instead of all at once to prevent dumps.


[01/16/2023 7:04 PM] Gogo#0000
Thanks

eveyone, good to be here! Any channel that i can view a rarity list?


[01/17/2023 6:43 AM] Kilver#0000
You can go on the one called citizens and type !cc and the no. of the citizen. It will show you it’s rarity score and it’s rank out of 2081.


[01/17/2023 8:52 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000

Okay minted 3 in a row that have afros...Does this qualify me for VIP entry into the Disco?


[01/17/2023 2:22 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
you must be very lucky when it was in a row 😆  i was trying to get 1 and it took me a few mints to get cc with afro


[01/17/2023 2:23 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Thought it may be a sign


[01/17/2023 3:50 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
3 apartments left and I currently own 0. Hmmmmm


[01/17/2023 3:51 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
I also want a body part for CC#0


[01/17/2023 3:53 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
CC #0 doesnt need any body parts


[01/17/2023 3:53 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Hes all diamond...what would it be upgraded to?


[01/17/2023 3:53 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
😂


[01/17/2023 3:53 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

I must be blind


[01/17/2023 3:55 PM] Kilver#0000
Sure only 2 diamond body parts


[01/17/2023 3:55 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
There you go @T U L O (ErgoMinnow)


[01/17/2023 3:55 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Since it has a diamond limb already, does that mean it only needs one to upgrade?


[01/17/2023 3:56 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
We will need to make a better upgradable & crafting system in the future.


[01/17/2023 3:57 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
What if I have 2 CCs with Diamond legs? Can I send a couple over to Gunslinger Pass and let one merk the other and steal their leg?


[01/17/2023 3:57 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
If someone wants to upgrade diamond body arm  on the cybercitizen that already has diamond body arm, he can have cyberium body part


[01/17/2023 3:58 PM] 3rdStryker#0000
progress up to it


[01/17/2023 3:58 PM] Kilver#0000
That makes sense


[01/17/2023 3:58 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Maybe I should upgrade a different monkey hahah


[01/17/2023 3:58 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
this version is just for start, I really believe we can have better system in the future.


[01/17/2023 3:58 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
And leave cc 0 pure


[01/17/2023 3:59 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
i cant imagine what does your collection look like man 😂


[01/17/2023 3:59 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
It’s a pretty good one I think 🙂


[01/17/2023 3:59 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
I have a few on skyharbor as well


[01/17/2023 3:59 PM] Kilver#0000
We will also need more body parts. 12 ain’t gonna cut it chief.


[01/17/2023 4:02 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Im looking forward to using some Serum E-18GN013-313 on one of my monkeys


[01/17/2023 4:03 PM] Kilver#0000
Oh yeah, can’t want for the serums! Can’t wait for the eggs too! Don’t get me started again…


[01/17/2023 4:04 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
You got all your bases covered with the eggs...Serums still leave a lot up oin the air...like which CCs to chose from


[01/17/2023 4:04 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
There will be, but not many until we figure out a crafting system. I've been thinking to have some items for crafting these upgradable parts and other stuff.


[01/17/2023 4:04 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
It would be better imo


[01/17/2023 4:04 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
.


[01/17/2023 4:05 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
Can people talk to each in game?


[01/17/2023 4:05 PM] Kilver#0000
Game will be single player at the beginning right?


[01/17/2023 4:05 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Would be kinda cool if crafting was tied to skill levels and having a certain percentage chance of crafting it correctly.


[01/17/2023 4:06 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Maybe have to do certain jobs to get required skillset to craft


[01/17/2023 4:07 PM] Kilver#0000
Yeah. You would need to farm components and pay CYPX for crafting body upgrades.


[01/17/2023 4:08 PM] Kilver#0000
We need to give CYPX as much utility in game as possible. 😁


[01/17/2023 4:09 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
Absolutely


[01/17/2023 4:09 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Yah. Correct, but it's already online, so all the data are real-time - your stats, saves, etc...
If we had more time, we could also add already a chat system.


[01/17/2023 4:10 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
If everything goes well, we could see multiplayer in Q1-Q2


[01/17/2023 4:10 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
Damnnnnnnnn


[01/17/2023 4:11 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Multiplayer is what will make cyberverse explode


[01/17/2023 4:11 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
I want to flex my citizen on all the Ergonauts I see in game

#noshame


[01/17/2023 4:11 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
Makes me so bullish


[01/17/2023 4:13 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
for now we have cypx for gambling (grandgambit casino) and as a fee for verifying your wallet in the game. More will be added as we will be developing the game.


[01/17/2023 4:14 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Thanks to multiplayer, we can make even more features available, so yeah, I'm super hyped for that as well. 😄


[01/17/2023 4:18 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
You guys have done an amazing job so far with laying the foundation to allow for all of these possibilities. Can't wait to be able to do a Space with the team once the game is released to go over all the features and future plans for the project.


[01/17/2023 4:27 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Is there plans to incorporate robotic legs into the metadata? If so, will it be done in the leveling up process or upgrading process? Apologies for asking questions that may be further down the road....just curious


[01/17/2023 6:08 PM] Gogo#0000
Saw you checking out #1275 😁 What do you think about it?


[01/17/2023 6:11 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Haha...just checking out what you offered for #0


[01/17/2023 6:11 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Its a nice monkey though


[01/17/2023 7:43 PM] Ninjah#0000
Will game be available on mobile, or just pc?


[01/17/2023 7:49 PM] Kilver#0000
Probably on mobile would be a stretch. But it would be cool.


[01/17/2023 9:20 PM] Ccmark_87#0000
Hi when the token will be airdroped to the gen2 holders?


[01/17/2023 9:22 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
are you talking about the holders who hold the old cyberpixels token?


[01/17/2023 9:23 PM] Ccmark_87#0000
Not, the gen2 nft holders


[01/17/2023 9:25 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
not sure what you mean? Where did you read that?
There is still in plans token swap between hold cyberpixels token and new one that is on spectrum. 
@CM Mongo  did we forget on something?


[01/17/2023 9:27 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Thank you very much! We really appreciate it. Looking forward to the space!


[01/17/2023 9:27 PM] Gogo#0000
Its up for sale if anyone is interested 😀


[01/17/2023 9:29 PM] Ccmark_87#0000
I remember read that the gen2 NFT buyers will received an CYPX token airdrop at some point


[01/17/2023 9:29 PM] Ccmark_87#0000
That was when the gen2 NFT went on sale


[01/17/2023 9:30 PM] Ccmark_87#0000

[01/17/2023 9:30 PM] Ccmark_87#0000
I read that in the announcement channel of this discord


[01/17/2023 9:32 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I have a few ideas on how to do this. I can't tell you now because we haven't decided the option yet.


[01/17/2023 9:34 PM] CM Mongo#0000
We did a cypx token drop during the first wave if I remember correctly , is that what you were referring too ?


[01/17/2023 9:35 PM] Ccmark_87#0000
Maybe is that, but I never received that airdrop


[01/17/2023 9:35 PM] Ccmark_87#0000
I just have been received the audio NFT airdrops


[01/17/2023 9:37 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
we did several airdrops, 250 cybercitizens to 250 ergopixel nft holders, cypx token to ergopixels, audionfts, cyberdino nfts to first wave2 minters (i think first 30-40).  Even twitter airdrop giveaway 😂  Don't really remember anymore


[01/17/2023 9:55 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
At launch only on PC

Nothing dodgy happening at my end. Like Slapshottwelve said, we are well connected to the Cardano community which as you know is huge. Our three artists are popular on Cardano and I'm in some good communities, such as the Faha100 and Ore BPM. And we've had some great sales from both our projects on SkyHarbor.

How can I get an Egg or Serum without buying it?


[01/20/2023 7:31 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
You can either mint a CC or buy on secondary


[01/20/2023 7:31 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
minting gives you a % based chance


[01/20/2023 8:14 PM] Gogo#0000

this airdrop happened, yet?


[01/21/2023 2:12 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000
There is a chance they get dropped when CC is minted...along with other tradable items and audio NFTS


[01/21/2023 2:13 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000
If you get one, it will come along with the CC

can you guys explain why someone paid 139 erg for the #225? Is there some trait very especial there or the person loved it personaly?


[01/21/2023 10:34 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
maybe the hoodie but overpaid imo


[01/21/2023 10:34 AM] Cesio#0000
I minted a hood yesterday


[01/21/2023 10:34 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000

[01/21/2023 10:34 AM] Kilver#0000
Because I liked it.

There you go ^


[01/21/2023 10:37 AM] Kilver#0000
Rarity < looks. In my opinion. Unless you have a top 20 or something.


[01/21/2023 10:38 AM] Cesio#0000
a teal pseudowindow stick lokks very nice 👀


[01/21/2023 10:38 AM] Cesio#0000
a teal pseudowindow stick looks very nice 👀


[01/21/2023 10:41 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Maybe, but looks are subjective and speculative whereas rarity is more concrete


[01/21/2023 10:41 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
I think looks do play a part though. No doubt about it.


[01/21/2023 10:42 AM] Kilver#0000
Definitely!  That’s why is not easy to appraise them.


[01/21/2023 10:47 AM] Kilver#0000
I also paid the high price on that one because he just sold me cheap apartment off the SH and felt like it’s not fair to not pay the artist the % they deserve.


[01/21/2023 10:47 AM] Kilver#0000
So I paid extra to make up for the % they lost on the apartment sale.


[01/21/2023 10:56 AM] Cesio#0000
what will be playable?


[01/21/2023 10:57 AM] Gogo#0000

[01/21/2023 2:45 PM] Cesio#0000
What is the issue?


[01/21/2023 2:45 PM] Cesio#0000
I didn't know ergo had this


[01/21/2023 2:45 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I think its a UTXO and data limit per a box thing


[01/21/2023 2:46 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
But I think wallets and dapps know noe and put warning on or don't allow the transaction


[01/21/2023 2:46 PM] Cesio#0000
I remember that using yoroi like 2 years ago was a nightmare


[01/21/2023 2:46 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
But I think wallets and dapps know now and put warning on or don't allow the transaction


[01/21/2023 2:47 PM] Cesio#0000
Because I mined ergo and had a lot of 0,5 and 1 ergo transactions from the pool


[01/21/2023 2:47 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
RIP Yoroi


[01/21/2023 2:47 PM] Kilver#0000
Won’t be missed


[01/21/2023 2:48 PM] Kilver#0000
Apparently moving all your nfts in a single transaction fixes that.


[01/21/2023 2:48 PM] Cesio#0000
I only totaly stoped mining like 1 month ago when my motherboard lit in fire


[01/21/2023 2:48 PM] Cesio#0000
I still didn't sell the GPUs

It helps for sure.


[01/21/2023 2:50 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
But if you have 100+ in there, you may have to do that more than you'd like to


[01/21/2023 2:50 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Especially if you're a Degen and move NFTs around a lot


[01/21/2023 2:51 PM] Kilver#0000
I don’t move them. That’s why they’re there and not in my Nautilus

is the best way to mint still sending 20 erg to that address?


[01/21/2023 2:58 PM] Cesio#0000
I kept mining ergo with three 3080s even when Eth was much better


[01/21/2023 2:59 PM] Cesio#0000
But for the 3080s I never used the pci multiplier


[01/21/2023 3:00 PM] Kilver#0000
I must have bought some Chinese shit. Glad I didn’t burned down my PC or house.

i was 1 mint too early! 😭


[01/21/2023 3:36 PM] Kilver#0000
I haven’t bought one. So I don’t know. But anything under 100 erg it’s a sin


[01/21/2023 3:36 PM] Kilver#0000
Unless you want the erg now.


[01/21/2023 3:37 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
in no rush. Theres one on SH for 150


[01/21/2023 3:37 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
its the second rarest egg as well


[01/21/2023 3:37 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
i was going to say based on kilvers purchases somewhere between 90-193.55


[01/21/2023 3:37 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

[01/21/2023 3:37 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000

Fair assessment


[01/21/2023 3:37 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
maybe 130 erg is fair.


[01/21/2023 3:38 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000

Don't know if it's relevant here. 
But I found this among my PC accessories, a AIO kit for the Radeon VII card. Do you think it's something that miners would find compelling?  🤔

[01/22/2023 7:39 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
what is your ELO in chess, sir? @T U L O (ErgoMinnow)


[01/22/2023 7:41 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
did you follow it through the ergowallet website?


[01/22/2023 7:43 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
1800 rapid on chess .com and 2000 on lichess


[01/22/2023 7:43 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
both rapid ratings.


[01/22/2023 7:43 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
nahh, you are too good lol


[01/22/2023 7:43 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
hehe thank you! I want to get 2k on chess .com haha


[01/22/2023 8:17 PM] Cesio#0000
is there an way to check the generation of the CC?


[01/22/2023 8:23 PM] Kilver#0000
There is only 1 generation in the 2081 citizens. Just released in 3 waves rather than all at once.


[01/22/2023 8:29 PM] Cesio#0000
"The levels and XP credits will be stored directly in the NFT's metadata. We believe this is the best solution for us to avoid cheating . We will be using smart contracts that will be reminting NFTs and rewriting metadatas after every single level up that the owner of NFT makes. " I didn't know that the very metadata from an ergo NFT could be changed like this


[01/22/2023 8:29 PM] Cesio#0000
will this cost a lot of Ergo in fees?


[01/22/2023 8:30 PM] Cesio#0000
energy is expensive 😄


[01/22/2023 8:31 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
it can be changed, when you remint the nft, but for the launch, we will be storing XP and levels in the game. More info will be in the announcement.

@Mr.Pixel wen game? XD


[01/22/2023 8:37 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
We are stuck here, unfortunately. Some of these features are done, but mainly UIs are left. We fixed a bug when player is connecting to the game, which is a good thing and ergopixels nfts on walls had an issue which is fixed as well.


[01/22/2023 8:38 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
as you can see, the nfts on walls are working :k_thumbs_up:

Diamond eggs are pretty rare


[01/23/2023 11:35 AM] Chuck#0000

it will be possible to win ERG in the game?

the cybercitzen give some advantage to gain?


[01/23/2023 4:17 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
You can stake characters for cyberverses token to which you can sell into erg


[01/23/2023 4:18 PM] Thirdstryker#0000

[01/23/2023 4:23 PM] asdjsahndasjisajdioajidasj11#0000
cool! thanks.

another question: the rank has some kind of influence on the gains?


[01/23/2023 4:26 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Welcome! I hope you are doing great! 
In the **early versions** of the game, rank will have no effect on the NFT's rewards.

It’s a combination of both, plus how clean it is plus personal preference.

So just how rare are the diamond body parts 🤔


[01/24/2023 6:39 AM] Kilver#0000
I feel like the % get messed up or something. We definitely pulled more apartments that are supposed to be much difficult to get than body parts.

Morning!


[01/24/2023 9:25 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Its a chance. You could even get 3 apartments in 3 mints if you are lucky enough


[01/24/2023 9:25 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Is it possible to get an egg AND an apartment in the same mint?


[01/24/2023 9:29 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
I minted 8 characters with no eggs 😑


[01/24/2023 9:30 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
No 😆


[01/24/2023 9:40 AM] Chuck#0000
Unlucky, I minted 3 with no extras

hahaha aww


[01/24/2023 9:44 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
the fact theres still a robot and apartments makes me wanna fomo lol


[01/24/2023 9:47 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
I minted 7 in a row, no extras or eggs. I calculated the changes. That is 0.022% of that happening


[01/24/2023 9:48 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
You sure the SM is ok?


[01/24/2023 9:50 AM] Thirdstryker#0000

[01/24/2023 9:59 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
i think youve wasted your bad luck. Time to go buy a lottery ticket.

[01/24/2023 10:27 AM] blai5e#0000

[01/24/2023 10:27 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000

[01/24/2023 10:28 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000

[01/24/2023 10:30 AM] blai5e#0000

[01/24/2023 10:31 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
thought you meant CC #3 LOL


[01/24/2023 10:31 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Shoes, pants, legs aren’t in the metadata of NFTs, since the current picture of citizen shows only half of the body in the nft

let me know when a reward is guaranteed 🙄🤣


[01/24/2023 2:25 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
You cannot stake your citizen while it's on skyharbor right?


[01/24/2023 2:27 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
When the game is released, more than half of those NFTs will be taken off SH.


[01/24/2023 2:27 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
They are just on there temporarily


[01/24/2023 2:35 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
NFTs will be split, some staking, some being on SH, either way, the price of the NFT will increase or you will be staking. Win win


[01/24/2023 2:36 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
On top of that, a good chance of getting a reward once you mint. So I don't understand why there are some mints left.


[01/24/2023 2:39 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
How's my logic? You should all be in fomo mode


[01/24/2023 2:48 PM] yeahokai#0000
How does rarities work? I can see there is a rarity score.. what's the highest score?


[01/24/2023 2:50 PM] 3rdStryker#0000
lower is better


[01/24/2023 2:52 PM] yeahokai#0000
Oh so the lower the rarity score the better?


[01/24/2023 2:54 PM] 3rdStryker#0000
yep, lower rarity score and ranking is better


[01/24/2023 2:54 PM] 3rdStryker#0000
robots, monkey and female tend to be rare


[01/24/2023 2:56 PM] yeahokai#0000
Is the ranking where the trophy is


[01/24/2023 2:56 PM] 3rdStryker#0000
yep


[01/24/2023 2:57 PM] 3rdStryker#0000
you can mint or you can buy off skyharbor


[01/24/2023 2:59 PM] yeahokai#0000
how much left to mint and what's the proce


[01/24/2023 2:59 PM] yeahokai#0000

Yeah if you can’t stake it while it’s on skyharbor then mannnnnnn they’re gonna be more scarce

@3rd gonna make me fomo


[01/24/2023 3:57 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
@Mr.Pixel do you know how much cypx you’ll get per citizen


[01/24/2023 3:58 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
Stake rate will depend on how many are staking and how many on SH


[01/24/2023 3:58 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
Not all will be staking


[01/24/2023 4:07 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
The official launch will unveil the rewards and available features. However, it's important to note that not all features outlined in the whitepaper will be immediately available upon launch. 
Also the features that will available are in an early development stage, so our launch will be mainly for the testing and balancing things.


[01/24/2023 4:08 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Thirdstyker, we will have different type of staking.


[01/24/2023 4:17 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000

Am interested to see how/if overall rankings may change when incorporating robotic legs, upgradable parts, and serums.


[01/24/2023 10:51 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
Those last few mints are going to fly when people know what rewards are left


[01/24/2023 11:14 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
The fact that there is still a large apartment and cyberium egg are enough for me to mint a few more!


[01/25/2023 1:13 AM] Thirdstryker#0000

Hey. The sale processor got stuck… already messaged hazey to look into it. 
Very sorry about it. It looks like there are 3 addresses that haven’t received NFTs yet.

Thanks for the heads up Mongo 💪


[01/25/2023 2:43 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Morning everyone!


[01/25/2023 2:58 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
It's  in our whitepaper, but we have made some adjustments to our system in preparation for the launch of the game. In order to align with the overall gaming experience, we have decided to change the distribution of staking rewards from every 5 days to daily rewards that can be claimed every 24 hours. 
The amount of rewards received will be based on your cybercitizen and level in the upgraded version. 
Additionally, players will be required to keep their citizens in their wallet to be eligible for the rewards and also join the game.

Please note that this is just the beginning and we plan to continue making changes and improvements to the game based on feedback from the community. 

The rewards structure will be reflected in the updated whitepaper.

No problem 😉


[01/25/2023 8:31 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
The development update is scheduled for completion on January 31st. (unexpected delays of several days may occur)
Following the update, we will conduct a private testing phase for a few days before releasing the game to all Cybercitizens holders. This testing is necessary to ensure the functionality of the rewards feature and apartment customization feature. 
We apologize for any delays that may have occurred... The launch date will be announced with game development update. We will also choose a few people from the community to test things out. 
@ihunt86 @3rd

[01/26/2023 2:42 PM] Cesio#0000
@Mr.Pixel you have to hide the mint page from the site


[01/26/2023 2:42 PM] Cesio#0000
I'm telling some people about cibercitzens and they will run away if they mint and it doesn't works


[01/26/2023 2:44 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Thank you for the info. I already messaged Mongo about it. It will be closed within a few hours.


[01/26/2023 2:47 PM] Cesio#0000
Ty


[01/26/2023 2:49 PM] Cesio#0000

[01/26/2023 4:54 PM] CM Mongo#0000

[01/28/2023 8:25 AM] andrΣw | ergogallery.com#0000
I want to buy a citizen. How do I determine rarity 👀 ?


[01/28/2023 8:27 AM] Kilver#0000
Go to #cybercitizens and type !cc followed by the citizen’s number.


[01/28/2023 8:27 AM] Kilver#0000
Ex. !cc 1578


[01/28/2023 8:28 AM] Kilver#0000
You will get all the traits plus rarity score and their position out of 2081. X/2081


[01/28/2023 8:33 AM] andrΣw | ergogallery.com#0000
Oh I was looking for a rarity channel but the naming wasn't obvious thank you!


[01/28/2023 8:34 AM] Kilver#0000
No problem!


[01/28/2023 8:36 AM] andrΣw | ergogallery.com#0000
Really hard to decide which one to buy 😄


[01/28/2023 8:38 AM] Kilver#0000
Yeah, it’s not very straightforward. Most of us think that some citizens with low rarity scores look much better than some of the rarer ones. It’s down to personal preference.


[01/28/2023 8:39 AM] Kilver#0000
I think you should buy what you think it looks cool.


[01/28/2023 8:39 AM] andrΣw | ergogallery.com#0000

Hi, people


[01/28/2023 11:30 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
hey all


[01/28/2023 11:30 AM] Cesio#0000
Can you guys tell about the pets?


[01/28/2023 11:30 AM] Cesio#0000
They will be in this first launch that will happen soon?


[01/28/2023 11:31 AM] Cesio#0000
They will start straight with a utility like staking?


[01/28/2023 11:32 AM] Cesio#0000
all the pets that come from common egg are the same?


[01/28/2023 11:33 AM] Cesio#0000
Or the egg rarity means a better luck to get better pets?


[01/28/2023 11:33 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Nope. There are more important things to do after the launch.  We will be mainly focusing on improving the game first.
For example balancing rewards, xp, adding more stats/skills, more jobs minigames to actually enjoy the game and more features.


[01/28/2023 11:33 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Pets won't have staking. At least its not a plan at the moment.


[01/28/2023 11:33 AM] Chuck#0000
Will there be pet games, like Pokémon 😂


[01/28/2023 11:35 AM] Cesio#0000
will there be some kind of PvP? Or even better, hardcore PvP (where dead people loses stuff)


[01/28/2023 11:35 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Also new movements for cybercitizens are in the work.


[01/28/2023 11:44 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
There are many ideas of what we could do with pets, but first we need to start with something small. 😅 
We'll share everything that will be available at launch in the upcoming development update, which will take place in 3 days.


[01/28/2023 11:45 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Pets also won't be ready at launch. Our artist is having a hard time getting to work on our plans because he has power outages quite often, due to the war in Ukraine.


[01/28/2023 11:45 AM] Cesio#0000
So close :UPTREND:


[01/28/2023 11:45 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
So we need to understand that.


[01/28/2023 11:45 AM] Cesio#0000

[01/28/2023 1:52 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
It would be enough that the pet follows you around imo


[01/28/2023 4:17 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
if any of these games being released on ERGO are anywhere between a gameboy pokemon game and runescape I will be content for life!

How to start my journey with Cyberverse!


[01/29/2023 4:33 AM] iluvass2#0000
How are you!


[01/29/2023 4:33 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
right now, minting is paused, but you can buy a citizen on skyharbor


[01/29/2023 4:34 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
next week the beta will be released


[01/29/2023 4:34 AM] iluvass2#0000
Noice 🚀


[01/29/2023 4:34 AM] iluvass2#0000
What should I buy first?


[01/29/2023 4:35 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
minting will be available around next week, around another 300 to mint


[01/29/2023 4:35 AM] iluvass2#0000
what will there be in beta?


[01/29/2023 4:35 AM] iluvass2#0000
Minting is best or buying?


[01/29/2023 4:35 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
i think two mini games, apartments, very simple to start with


[01/29/2023 4:36 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
its up to you, minting is like a gamble, you have a chance of getting an egg, apartment with the mint


[01/29/2023 4:37 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
skyharbor has citizens up for less than the minting price, but pretty basic looking


[01/29/2023 4:44 AM] iluvass2#0000
Ok... If I buy a citizen I'm good to go?


[01/29/2023 4:45 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
you have access to the game yes


[01/29/2023 4:45 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
you can stake your citizens too


[01/29/2023 4:45 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
so i have more than one


[01/29/2023 4:45 AM] iluvass2#0000

[01/29/2023 8:01 AM] iluvass2#0000
But I have many questions!!!


[01/29/2023 8:06 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Hey! Welcome! I’m currently at work, so I won’t be able to answer all your questions atm, but I will try 🙂


[01/29/2023 8:08 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
To play the game you need a cybercitizen nft. You can either buy it at skyharbor or wait for the next week when we resume our drop that is currently paused.


[01/29/2023 8:09 AM] $nicnac#0000
You are on the right place to get your questions answered


[01/29/2023 8:10 AM] iluvass2#0000
Ok


[01/29/2023 8:10 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
The game will support nautilus wallet at first


[01/29/2023 8:10 AM] iluvass2#0000
What will the mint cost?


[01/29/2023 8:11 AM] iluvass2#0000

N is there any genesis Nft for the game?


[01/29/2023 8:12 AM] iluvass2#0000
Actually I'm looking at skyharbor for one cheap Nft around 13-15 ergo!


[01/29/2023 8:12 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
For wave3 mint costs 20 erg, but you have a chance to also get extra gifts with cybercitizen nft such as serums, or apartment or cyberegg


[01/29/2023 8:12 AM] iluvass2#0000
What should I look for?


[01/29/2023 8:13 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
The game will be available to anyone with cybercitizen nft in the wallet


[01/29/2023 8:13 AM] iluvass2#0000
If i buy wave3 only? For 20ergo!


[01/29/2023 8:14 AM] iluvass2#0000

Cybercitizens  drop was split into 3 waves, due to high amount of NFTs in the collection, but it’s the same generation.


[01/29/2023 8:16 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
No. Just a citizen, since it’s an nft on the secondary marketplace and not a mint.


[01/29/2023 8:16 AM] iluvass2#0000
Okey thanks.... Will wait for wave 3 🔥🔥🔥


[01/29/2023 8:17 AM] iluvass2#0000
What about genesis?


[01/29/2023 8:17 AM] iluvass2#0000
Are all Nft eligible for future drops?


[01/29/2023 8:17 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
You can also check out NFTs how they will look like in the game, simply visit #cybercitizens room and type !cc # number


[01/29/2023 8:18 AM] iluvass2#0000
Will look later 😊 right now learning 🙌


[01/29/2023 8:20 AM] iluvass2#0000
Any exact date wen wave 3 mint will start? N what bout bots sometimes bots buy them all😱🫣


[01/29/2023 8:20 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
We have 2 generations 
1 generation - these won’t be added as a playable characters for the launch, because there is a change needed and we will be announcing a proposal for that after we sell out cybercitizens. However, they are added to the game as **NFTs on the wall** feature. Owner of an apartment who also owns gen1 can place his nft on walls of his apartments. 
Gen2 - cybercitizens


[01/29/2023 8:21 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Don’t worry about bots 😆 all people who wanted to mint before, had their chance with no issue with bots


[01/29/2023 8:21 AM] iluvass2#0000
Didn't understand 😵‍💫


[01/29/2023 8:22 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Next game development update with game launch date, updated whitepaper will be announced this Tuesday

Will there be a snapshot of the wallets at time of alpha game launch or will you be able to buy a citizen post alpha game launch and still participate in the game?

[01/29/2023 2:05 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Works fine on mobile? Will check it out when I get home in a few hours


[01/29/2023 2:07 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
Seems fine for me


[01/29/2023 3:58 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Just got an offer of 1k erg + rank 3 CC for #0.


[01/29/2023 3:58 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Said no though although an amazing offer.


[01/29/2023 3:59 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Was tempted.


[01/29/2023 3:59 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Bro


[01/29/2023 3:59 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I would have done that in a heartbeat, LOL


[01/29/2023 4:00 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
No way man.


[01/29/2023 4:00 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
2k ERG is my bottom.


[01/29/2023 4:00 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
hahaha


[01/29/2023 4:00 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
1.5k ERG and rank 3 i countered with but he wasnt down


[01/29/2023 4:00 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
I have the opinion that #0 is the best NFT on Ergo. Like out of any project.


[01/29/2023 4:01 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
If that's the case, I feel you.


[01/29/2023 4:01 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Still a generous offer


[01/29/2023 4:01 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Yeah it was a great offer


[01/29/2023 4:01 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Very generous


[01/29/2023 4:01 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
made me think lol


[01/29/2023 4:01 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
I agree 1000%


[01/29/2023 4:01 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
i felt like that was about a 1500 ERG value


[01/29/2023 4:02 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
when the bull comes i can see #0 going for a nutty amount.


[01/29/2023 4:02 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Maybe...who knows..hard to value something that market hasn't dictated yet


[01/29/2023 4:02 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
yeah i agree with that.


[01/29/2023 4:02 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
I just know thet ERGnomes have gone for insane amounts in the past


[01/29/2023 4:02 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
and i feel that cyberverse is taking over


[01/29/2023 4:02 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
blue chip status


[01/29/2023 4:02 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
just my opinion i suppose.


[01/29/2023 4:03 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
If thats the case, stack an army and get those staking rewards...not that you don't have a lot already


[01/29/2023 4:03 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Yeah absolutely


[01/29/2023 4:03 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
i think im near 30


[01/29/2023 4:03 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
1000 ERG can get a lot


[01/29/2023 4:03 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
not 100% sure


[01/29/2023 4:03 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
youre not wrong.


[01/29/2023 4:03 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
And a good amount of cybertokens


[01/29/2023 4:03 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
#0 may go for even more than i can imagine if this game blows up too


[01/29/2023 4:03 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
its hard to know lol


[01/29/2023 4:04 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
bit of a gamble


[01/29/2023 4:04 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Depends on price of ERG


[01/29/2023 4:04 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
absolutely.


[01/29/2023 4:04 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I would have secured a great value for it while maintaining a robot


[01/29/2023 4:04 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
diamond skin maybe me diamond hand it baby


[01/29/2023 4:04 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
But I'm poor so FA from me is sketchy, lol


[01/29/2023 4:05 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
What is FA?


[01/29/2023 4:05 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Financial advice


[01/29/2023 4:05 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
XD im not rich either dw.


[01/29/2023 4:05 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
maybe i made a dumb choice but


[01/29/2023 4:05 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
I think #0 is worth a lot.


[01/29/2023 4:05 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
For sure


[01/29/2023 4:05 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
I wouldn't have taken the offer either


[01/29/2023 4:05 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Makes me feel better hah


[01/29/2023 4:06 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
currently countering with my final offer to him


[01/29/2023 4:06 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
1300 erg and rank 3.


[01/29/2023 4:06 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
will let you all know x D


[01/29/2023 4:07 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
Is rank 3 a robot?


[01/29/2023 4:07 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Yes


[01/29/2023 4:07 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Just not a diamond one


[01/29/2023 4:07 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
it is.


[01/29/2023 4:07 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
#0 is only diamond


[01/29/2023 4:08 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Yessir.


[01/29/2023 4:09 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
My thought is, would someone pay that much if ERG is at $5...$10...always thinking of that threshold for these long hold NFTs


[01/29/2023 4:10 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
I think they would. Remember that one ERGNome that went for like 10k ERG on the auction house?


[01/29/2023 4:10 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
or something crazy


[01/29/2023 4:10 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
or was it 1k erg at 20 dollars


[01/29/2023 4:10 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
i dont remember


[01/29/2023 4:10 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
It had about the same value as the ergosaur #1 that sold


[01/29/2023 4:11 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
When the game starts, and alot of the nfts go off SH, people will be paying more I think


[01/29/2023 4:13 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
People will buy just to stake, people will take off to stake and play. Which should reduce supply on SH


[01/29/2023 4:13 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I think it will as well, though you won't need a CC to play. I think good value will be had from staking so floor should increase...just don't know about top ones


[01/29/2023 4:13 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Yeah my declining of the offer is a bit of a long term play i think. risky but we will see.


[01/29/2023 4:13 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I just want to see 1 robot sell to get an idea of market value


[01/29/2023 4:13 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
you dont need a CC to play ?


[01/29/2023 4:13 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
You do for beta


[01/29/2023 4:13 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Im thinking 500 is a good start for a robot


[01/29/2023 4:13 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
what do you guys think?


[01/29/2023 4:13 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
has a robot never sold?


[01/29/2023 4:14 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
I think when game is out of beta you don't need but having citizen gives you lots of extra things


[01/29/2023 4:14 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
No robot sales on open market that i know of


[01/29/2023 4:14 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
ooo someone selling for 450 on SH


[01/29/2023 4:14 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
what character would you use without a CC?


[01/29/2023 4:14 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I'm not sure...maybe a default one


[01/29/2023 4:15 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
Just a standard default character


[01/29/2023 4:15 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Interesting


[01/29/2023 4:15 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
The game wouldn't be any good if it limited the userbase by only letting citizens play, it wouldn't grow


[01/29/2023 4:16 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Good idea to further ingrain the play and earn philosophy...low barrier for entry though perks make owning CC worth it


[01/29/2023 4:16 PM] Thirdstryker#0000
It has to hook people into buying a character, like free to play games and people buying skins


[01/29/2023 4:20 PM] Gogo#0000
but the price of the citizens will grow


[01/29/2023 4:20 PM] Gogo#0000
which makes the game more valuable


[01/29/2023 4:23 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Agreed.


[01/30/2023 1:21 AM] BenSon15#0000
Who wants a rank 18 cc for 30 Ergo?


[01/30/2023 1:25 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
I dont really need more but thats a pretty solid price. I'm sure someone would take that off your hands on skyharbor

Can't wait to list the cybercitizens like the other collection. That's super speed then

I will send the files today for the list 🙂


[01/31/2023 12:39 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000

[02/04/2023 6:54 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
My guess is rankings might not matter as much now if metadata is updated to include robot legs and any morphed CCs from the serums....just a guess though


[02/04/2023 7:07 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Will ranking change?

@andrΣw | ergogallery.com  did a great job with the website!


[02/04/2023 10:23 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

[02/04/2023 10:24 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

[02/04/2023 10:37 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
very very soon


[02/04/2023 10:37 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
will be posting last clips in #game-features  and i will publish the link


[02/04/2023 11:34 PM] Cesio#0000
Why do you recomend to play with only one wallet?


[02/04/2023 11:43 PM] CM Mongo#0000
well you'd need to have all your cyberverse nfts on one wallet , as when you connect with nautilus it checks for any cyberverse nfts and applies them ingame if found


[02/04/2023 11:52 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
Im assuming this means they can not be listed either?


[02/04/2023 11:53 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
You need to have your citizens in your wallet to receive daily rewards


[02/04/2023 11:55 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
Hmm so a full 24 hours in wallet? Or just time of claiming reward


[02/04/2023 11:57 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Oh, you can claim the rewards and after that, list for sale your citizen again 😄


[02/04/2023 11:57 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
if you buy a citizen that has claimed rewards already that day, you will need to wait 24 hours to claim the rewards from that one nft


[02/04/2023 11:58 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
Might as well make them work if they are sitting on skyharbor!


[02/04/2023 11:58 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
btw do you see this channels? i just open them for citizen role

[02/05/2023 12:37 AM] Cesio#0000
I got it


[02/05/2023 12:37 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I refunded you those 2 tx. Just don't spam it 😂 
Refresh the page and send 1 tx before the countdown ends. You should be connected to the game within 10-15 seconds


[02/05/2023 12:38 AM] Cesio#0000
I'm in. The problem is that the wallet I was trying to connect have all the NFTs listed


[02/05/2023 12:40 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
You can play with 2 wallets, it just not recommended. There is no log out, it will automatically log you out in 6 hours, so you can try connect with the other wallet as well to claim the daily rewards OR you can connect with another browser that supports nautilus wallet.

is it possible to send the transaction to confirm wallet ownership from another computer?


[02/05/2023 1:23 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Yes, you can.


[02/05/2023 1:23 AM] Or3l#0000
and then just refreshing should allow me to connect to the game right


[02/05/2023 1:23 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
But you can't play on both devices at the same time. It will kick you from one of the computer


[02/05/2023 1:24 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
You don't have to refresh the site, it will load once the tx is confirmed during verification process


[02/05/2023 1:24 AM] Or3l#0000
what happens if the transaction is not confirmed within 3 min?


[02/05/2023 1:25 AM] Or3l#0000
Asking this question because doesn't look like it worked for me but I am going to try again


[02/05/2023 1:25 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
The tx doesn't have to be confirmed. The game checks if the tx is pending.


[02/05/2023 1:25 AM] Or3l#0000
hum


[02/05/2023 1:26 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000

does it work with nautilus?


[02/05/2023 1:44 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
depends on the type of apartment. Is it small or medium?


[02/05/2023 1:44 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Yes! Only nautilus support for now


[02/05/2023 1:44 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000

the daily rewards take a bit longer to receive, we will try to work on it upcoming days. 
It will be also way better once we add auto-update so it can automatically update your balance without refreshing or NFTs, I promise!


[02/05/2023 2:20 AM] Cesio#0000

[02/05/2023 4:38 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
do you have to login everyday to claim or does it accumlate?


[02/05/2023 4:47 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
I sent the transaction but I didnt login


[02/05/2023 4:48 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
oh i sent ergo not CYPX


[02/05/2023 4:52 AM] ProtoSuckaPunk#0000
I can only send 2 decimal places of CYPX and it needs 4???


[02/05/2023 4:53 AM] ProtoSuckaPunk#0000

[02/05/2023 4:53 AM] aradaiel#0000

[02/05/2023 4:53 AM] ProtoSuckaPunk#0000

[02/05/2023 4:54 AM] ProtoSuckaPunk#0000
Yes


[02/05/2023 4:54 AM] aradaiel#0000
don't add any erg, select cypx and then put in the 4 digit decimal


[02/05/2023 4:55 AM] ProtoSuckaPunk#0000
Okay, that's what I've been trying and it doesn't let me type more than 2 decimal places


[02/05/2023 4:55 AM] aradaiel#0000
it defaults to 2 decimals but keep tying and it will change it

[02/05/2023 7:51 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Have you been playing 6 hours straight? 😳
Tha game automatically logs you out after 6 hours. It will be changed in the next update


[02/05/2023 7:51 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Morning all


[02/05/2023 7:51 AM] lexymon#0000
omg this counter for verifying is... terrible Q__Q


[02/05/2023 7:53 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I never had problem with that 🤣 maybe keep it longer? For 10 minutes instead of 3 🤔


[02/05/2023 7:54 AM] beastrong23#0000
nope but good thing itll be changed. ik 0.1xx cypx is cheap (for now) but i assumed verifying is one time thing 😄


[02/05/2023 7:56 AM] lexymon#0000
3 minutes is also a bit short for a blockchain with 2 minutes blocks isnt it?


[02/05/2023 7:56 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Check out the #game-features


[02/05/2023 7:57 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Nope. The game detects pending tx which is usually visible 10-20 seconds after player sends a fee


[02/05/2023 7:57 AM] lexymon#0000
ah okay


[02/05/2023 7:59 AM] lexymon#0000
does not work..


[02/05/2023 8:00 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Are you doing it the same as on the video I posted?


[02/05/2023 8:00 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
In the announcement


[02/05/2023 8:00 AM] lexymon#0000
let me check


[02/05/2023 8:01 AM] Kilver#0000
Make sure you’re not sending 0.1xx erg instead, I almost did it the first time. XD


[02/05/2023 8:01 AM] lexymon#0000
ya i did


[02/05/2023 8:01 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Also be careful what wallet you connect and from what wallet you are sending a fee or what tokens you are sending 😆


[02/05/2023 8:03 AM] Kilver#0000
Public test is still inaccessible to me. I ‘m not allowed to see anything in there.


[02/05/2023 8:03 AM] lexymon#0000
the first time i did the tx after the countdown was finished, because i didnt know if its  a waiting countdown or "do it within this time". the second time i did it within the time


[02/05/2023 8:03 AM] lexymon#0000
both times didnt work


[02/05/2023 8:04 AM] Kilver#0000
But you are sending cypx, not erg right?


[02/05/2023 8:04 AM] lexymon#0000
yes...

[02/05/2023 8:06 AM] lexymon#0000
probably the first tx which was too late fucked it up?


[02/05/2023 8:07 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Not sure, I already had the same issue that I forgot about the timer 🤣 so i just refresh the site and resend a fee and it worked fine for me


[02/05/2023 8:08 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000

[02/05/2023 8:10 AM] lexymon#0000

[02/05/2023 8:19 AM] Kilver#0000
Dunno what squatter laws are in Cyberia.


[02/05/2023 8:19 AM] Kilver#0000

How do we stake nfts


[02/05/2023 8:48 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
You can claim daily rewards in the bank 
Check out the #game-features for the clip that is showing how it works


[02/05/2023 8:48 AM] Samish#0000
Oh thanks


[02/05/2023 8:54 AM] Samish#0000
Yes I see the  bank deposit


[02/05/2023 8:54 AM] Samish#0000
Nice


[02/05/2023 9:01 AM] Samish#0000
I think ..... only cop 👮‍♂️  citizens should be able to enter the sacred police station.   That and bums with eye patches


[02/05/2023 9:07 AM] Kilver#0000
What is the use of the police station and hospital?


[02/05/2023 9:08 AM] ManthanShah#0000
Total supply of cypx token ?


[02/05/2023 9:08 AM] Futurejon5#0000
Gonna have to give it a go tomorrow, freaking awesome.


[02/05/2023 9:09 AM] Futurejon5#0000
Wish I could walk my Dino around 😪


[02/05/2023 9:10 AM] Kilver#0000
I think 570 mil.


[02/05/2023 9:12 AM] ManthanShah#0000
yes it is mentioned in old white paper, but in new one it says X amount...


[02/05/2023 9:13 AM] Kilver#0000
Hmm… I don’t think the amount would have changed


[02/05/2023 9:13 AM] Samish#0000
How many tokens did you claim


[02/05/2023 9:14 AM] Samish#0000
I got 252.  I think I need more CyberCitizens


[02/05/2023 9:14 AM] Kilver#0000
Me? From the bank?


[02/05/2023 9:14 AM] Samish#0000
Yeah


[02/05/2023 9:14 AM] Kilver#0000
269


[02/05/2023 9:15 AM] Samish#0000
Nice


[02/05/2023 9:16 AM] Samish#0000
I have 72 Citizens  .... regretting selling the 6 sold


[02/05/2023 9:17 AM] Kilver#0000
I don’t know exactly how many I have. But I did buy as many as I could afford.


[02/05/2023 9:17 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
where do you see how much CYPX tokens you got from bank?


[02/05/2023 9:17 AM] Samish#0000
I gave a Monkey to a friend and traded 1 too


[02/05/2023 9:17 AM] Samish#0000
In your wallet


[02/05/2023 9:18 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
like i want to know the exact amount


[02/05/2023 9:18 AM] Kilver#0000
It will take a few minutes for the transaction to happened


[02/05/2023 9:20 AM] Kilver#0000
I don’t think you can find out at the moment. U just have to see what cypx you have and what amount you have after.


[02/05/2023 9:21 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
i see lol


[02/05/2023 9:21 AM] Kilver#0000
Unless you look up the wallet and the transactions


[02/05/2023 9:21 AM] Samish#0000
Yeah I looked at the Mobile wallet transaction details.


[02/05/2023 9:23 AM] Samish#0000
Be cool if the cop nfts could grab citizens and drag them to the police station for a few CYPX.  Just getting paid to clean up the streets


[02/05/2023 9:23 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
i was literally thinking the same thing, a game where people walk around cleaning up trash


[02/05/2023 9:24 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
will be updated soon with the burned tokens from the staker & seed rounds. I'm waiting for marty's response now


[02/05/2023 9:24 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
ATM, nothing. But it will be used in the future.


[02/05/2023 9:24 AM] Samish#0000
Yeah a few good ideas.


[02/05/2023 9:25 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
what is the reward for being top 3 bar tending?


[02/05/2023 9:25 AM] Samish#0000
That was hard.  I could not find the drinks


[02/05/2023 9:25 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
This. But we will add function of "expected daily rewards": 
so people can see how much should they get


[02/05/2023 9:25 AM] 3rdStryker#0000

[02/05/2023 9:26 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000

@CM Mongo  will add a button on the website when he wakes up


[02/05/2023 12:35 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
We also found a bug when claiming rewards, so we stopped it for 1-2 hours to fix the issue.  If you claim rewards and haven't received anything yet, it will be automatically sent once it's fixed 🙂


[02/05/2023 1:16 PM] slapshottwelve#0000

[02/05/2023 2:44 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Do you send erg as a fee or cypx?

[02/05/2023 2:48 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
You need to send CYPX to the address before the timer runs out. 
After you send it, it will connect you within 10-20 seconds.


[02/05/2023 2:48 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Depends on when the tx shows pending on the ergo explorer


[02/05/2023 2:49 PM] ihunt86#0000

cypx utility for now is the grand gambit listing and the in-game fee, which is not the best utility, BUT we plan to push 2 more utilities this month for cypx.

[02/05/2023 5:04 PM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#0000
I can sell you an apartment Mongo


[02/05/2023 5:05 PM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#0000
But it'll cost you 300 ERG :KEK:


[02/05/2023 5:05 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I've been waiting for this price 🤣


[02/05/2023 5:06 PM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#0000
Honestly I don't even know if I'd want to sell it for even that... I'm waiting for the 500 ERG mark xD


[02/05/2023 5:18 PM] sonofawitch#0000
how can i spend that stamina?


[02/05/2023 5:19 PM] CM Mongo#0000
At the club, barman job , uses 1 stamina per play


[02/05/2023 5:21 PM] sonofawitch#0000
:BullRun:


[02/05/2023 5:22 PM] Rothsnapper#0000
how do you move around in the game?


[02/05/2023 5:22 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
WASD or arrows


[02/05/2023 5:23 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
WASD or arrows on the keyboard


[02/05/2023 5:23 PM] Rothsnapper#0000

[02/05/2023 5:40 PM] valkynut#0000
I recommend putting the rarer ergopixels


[02/05/2023 5:48 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
There's already mona lisa and ergonaut just filling the spots, but I think we should do a community vote and add in what people would like

Oh yah, ErgoPixels collection needs to be discussed as well. After we sell out wave3, we should start a proposal & discussion about the future of ErgoPixels.


[02/05/2023 5:52 PM] Kilver#0000
Can’t wait!


[02/05/2023 6:20 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Anyone able to get more than 320 pts in the mini game?


[02/05/2023 6:20 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
seems to be my cap


[02/05/2023 6:21 PM] Colombian#0000
The higher your barman level the more score possible right now. Seems to be the case, I think Pixel talked about it already


[02/05/2023 6:21 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
i didnt 410 i think


[02/05/2023 6:21 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
i did *


[02/05/2023 6:21 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Gotcha


[02/05/2023 6:21 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
correct!


[02/05/2023 6:21 PM] mongocm#0000
Yeah higher level lets you earn more points


[02/05/2023 6:22 PM] Colombian#0000
I like this system as it rewards the grinders a little bit


[02/05/2023 6:23 PM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#0000
I get the mid to high 320's


[02/05/2023 6:23 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
there will be more for grinders


[02/05/2023 6:24 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Calculated it would take 12.5 hours a day to do 5 mini games for each citizen....gonna have the kids grinding on it while at work, LOL


[02/05/2023 6:25 PM] Colombian#0000
Maybe ill start streaming for the culture! Ill be grinding it anyway might as well document it!


[02/05/2023 6:25 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
this would be dope!


[02/05/2023 6:26 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
also we have a new artist to help us with the project


[02/05/2023 6:26 PM] mongocm#0000
Most I've got was 320 I think, my barman level was 3 though


[02/05/2023 6:27 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
(re  : *<Mr.Pixel> also we have a new artist to help us with the project*) 
 
 Very nice. Congrata!


[02/05/2023 6:27 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Thanks!


[02/05/2023 6:35 PM] Kilver#0000
Lol. I thought i did very well and I managed to only get 298 points.


[02/05/2023 6:36 PM] mongocm#0000
getting past 300 at lower levels is rough


[02/05/2023 6:36 PM] Kilver#0000
What does the lvl up give you?


[02/05/2023 6:36 PM] Kilver#0000
More points?


[02/05/2023 6:37 PM] mongocm#0000
I'm not 100% sure but yeah I think customers also wait longer, a small point multiplier


[02/05/2023 6:39 PM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#0000

Citizen level = bonus for daily rewards

 Hey, the game has one minigame you can take part in, you can play 5 times per day as each nft has 5 stamina, and there is a leaderboard keeping track of points and every tier of points you reach awards you some cypx, if you have any of our apartment nfts, you can head to the building and enter you apartment and decorate it how you want, floors walls, all furniture is available, The bank you can claim CYPX once per day per NFT you own (you get more depending on rarity score of citizen)


[02/05/2023 7:04 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
you can claim daily rewards, play barman job and also compete in the leaderboard for extra cypx bonus rewards when you are top 3 places, design your apartments, listen to audionfts and more! 🙂


[02/05/2023 7:04 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
It's still public test version, but you can already earn cypx tokens


[02/05/2023 7:04 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000

Just figured I'd report that as a bug as well


[02/05/2023 7:24 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

[02/05/2023 7:25 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
when this will be fixed, it will be a big difference with gaining points


[02/05/2023 7:25 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
at least 20-40 more

Barman quest needs to be top score? imma wait for reset then xD


[02/06/2023 12:34 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Should just be to hit x points if I remember correctly


[02/06/2023 12:35 AM] aradaiel#0000
so I don't have twitter, does that mean I need to make an account to do this?


[02/06/2023 12:36 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Unfortunately yeah, I could actually remove the follow req for the quests , give me a little bit


[02/06/2023 12:36 AM] aradaiel#0000
I'm wierd, I know


[02/06/2023 12:39 AM] aradaiel#0000
I just made a twitter, don't worry about it unless you want to

[02/06/2023 12:51 AM] CM Mongo#0000
does crew3 let you post two images for quests or just one ?


[02/06/2023 12:52 AM] aradaiel#0000
I think just 1


[02/06/2023 12:52 AM] aradaiel#0000
It wouldn't let me do 2, so I did one screenshot with the requirements in it for the barman one


[02/06/2023 12:54 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Yeah, I can also check in back end with just wallet address so that should be good


[02/06/2023 12:54 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Yeah..just the one


[02/06/2023 12:55 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Its been a team effort today. We want to get that 40k quest

[02/06/2023 12:58 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Enough for 250 mini games


[02/06/2023 12:59 AM] mongocm#0000

Best investment ever!


[02/06/2023 1:12 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
Why stop at the high score when you could have the top 3 high scores?! Give them each their own wallet! 😅


[02/06/2023 1:19 AM] aradaiel#0000

My apartment in gunslinger was not showing too


[02/06/2023 4:01 AM] NinjaZ_Ronin#0000
for it its opening up the yoroi dapp connector by default and not getting option for nautilus


[02/06/2023 4:01 AM] Samish#0000
Good thing I have 3 other apartments to play with


[02/06/2023 4:01 AM] NinjaZ_Ronin#0000
gonna disable yoroi and check


[02/06/2023 4:01 AM] 3rdstryker#0000
just send the funds via nautilus


[02/06/2023 4:03 AM] NinjaZ_Ronin#0000

You put in your erg address and then it will prompt you with how much CYPX to send to an address. Did you use spectrum to grab some CYPX?


[02/06/2023 4:41 AM] russel#0000
ill gt some but its not coming up with amount to send?


[02/06/2023 4:41 AM] russel#0000
its just this screen like this after i clock connect wallet

I validated today so I can't check the actual ui, but it should load with a bar to enter your address

[02/06/2023 8:20 AM] exciter👻#0000
Hey gang!
Long time since I visited the ergoverse. Great advacements , I see! Well done team!
So, my issue...when I go to enter the game I need to send a small amount of cypx, but my Nautilus wallet allows me to enter up to 2 digits pass the comm, i.e. I need to send 0.1686, but I can enter only 0.16
Any ideas? Thank you!


[02/06/2023 8:31 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
You need the new token called CYPX instead of CYBERPIXELS. You can trade cypx for erg on spectrum. 
We will be hosting an swap event where people holding old cyber pixel will be able to swap it of new soon.


[02/06/2023 8:31 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Glad to have you here!


[02/06/2023 8:32 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
And thank you very much. We are still in public test version so many bugs may appear and there are missing a lot of small features that can make the game more user-friendly.

[02/06/2023 9:25 AM] ThatOtherFella#0000
Hey, where do I play the public test version? Been a while since I was here..


[02/06/2023 9:45 AM] lexymon#0000
Are the daily rewards fixed per citizen? Or influenced by anything?


[02/06/2023 9:46 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
i think they can increase if you level up your citizen, but more rarer the citizen higher rewards


[02/06/2023 9:46 AM] lexymon#0000
Ah okay


[02/06/2023 9:46 AM] lexymon#0000
Thanks


[02/06/2023 9:47 AM] lexymon#0000
So unclaimed accumulate or do they have to be claimed daily?


[02/06/2023 9:48 AM] 3rdStryker#0000
im not sure to be honest


[02/06/2023 9:58 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
You need to claim daily. Check out the latest announcement for more info.

[02/06/2023 10:00 AM] Kilver#0000
@Mr.Pixel how is owning a citizen different from not owning one? Can you still play the minigame?


[02/06/2023 10:00 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
You can’t play if you don’t have citizen in the wallet


[02/06/2023 10:01 AM] Kilver#0000
So all you can do is walk around?


[02/06/2023 10:03 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Not sure what you mean how, sorry 😅
Right now the game is for everyone who hold cybercitizen Nft and they have access to all activities


[02/06/2023 10:04 AM] Kilver#0000
So I can’t even access the game if I don’t have a citizen in my wallet? Even if I send the cypx to the address to log in?


[02/06/2023 10:04 AM] Kilver#0000
As I understood from before you could play the game with a generic character.


[02/06/2023 10:08 AM] Kilver#0000
Basically I’m preparing a Reddit post about the game. And if I ask people to check out the game, that means they can’t until they own a citizen right? Is asking to financially commit to something first before they get the chance to see if they would enjoy it first.


[02/06/2023 10:09 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
If you connect the game without any citizen it shows you minting info

[02/06/2023 10:16 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Yeah. 😅 I can help you with it later today when I get home if you want


[02/06/2023 10:18 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
Only citizens during beta


[02/06/2023 10:19 AM] Kilver#0000
Yeah, I will start writing the post at some point today, dunno how long will take me to finish but you will have a look over it before I post anything.


[02/06/2023 10:21 AM] Kilver#0000
So the mandatory citizen ownership is only for the beta version?


[02/06/2023 10:24 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
There are plans to release to public with a standard model. It's in the whitepaper. Eventually it will be open for all as far as I understand


[02/06/2023 10:27 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Yah. It’s our plan with scaling

I think I ended the night 11k in 3rd. 1st and 2nd were way gone at that point lol


[02/06/2023 11:22 AM] Kilver#0000
I guess you can do an average of 1500 points per citizen. So 10 citizens will put you on 15k. 100 citizens will give you a nice 150k points if you grind


[02/06/2023 11:22 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
😳


[02/06/2023 11:23 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Avarage per citizen 300


[02/06/2023 11:23 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Per stamina


[02/06/2023 11:23 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Yah basically 🤣


[02/06/2023 11:24 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
But I don’t think someone would play that much.

To play with 100 citizens only takes 16.6 hours.

For any self repeating grinder, those are rookie numbers.

Sooooo to whoever may be sweeping the floor on skyharbor..... (9eZ9v2jpXHFyneqWZQbnFb1gZr6db6cdsKKJrztuAeTWKRVcnN6) i may have sent you 20 erg by accident instead of to the minting address..... (may have been stalking your purchases) Would be very grateful if you could send it back!! 🙌

You will be glad to know its going to more cyber citizens!


[02/06/2023 12:17 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Should we go for 40k today boys?


[02/06/2023 12:20 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
I see that address a lot. Even on Auction house. They usually buy all of the Cyberpunks. @slapshottwelve Ask Cyberpunk founder. I bet he knows who it is.


[02/06/2023 12:23 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I hope this will be solved…only saw this address on skyharbor. we will try to help you and ask around


[02/06/2023 12:25 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Oh my! Almost did that once as well on AH. Hope you get it back

Did you have nautilus wallet


[02/06/2023 3:08 PM] CM Mongo#0000
I still have 118 erg I sent to a random wallet lol


[02/06/2023 3:08 PM] aradaiel#0000
@CM Mongo he was using nautilus wallet with brave and it wasn't showing the login


[02/06/2023 3:08 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Will look into that today


[02/06/2023 3:08 PM] aradaiel#0000
he tried chrome and it worked


[02/06/2023 3:08 PM] aradaiel#0000
He never said if he was actually able to log in though


[02/06/2023 3:13 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Hmm okay , wowee I have lots of quests to review 😅


[02/06/2023 3:27 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

[02/06/2023 3:34 PM] lexymon#0000
i changed my address im playing with, maybe this will cause a problem? because i made the quests with my old one


[02/06/2023 3:35 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Should be fine as I manually verify in backend , that quest will be changed soon as some people prefer not to show wallet addresses


[02/06/2023 3:40 PM] aradaiel#0000
need more citizens to get more leaderboard points :p

[02/06/2023 4:16 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

[02/06/2023 4:38 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
it was actually less than that. Not sure


[02/06/2023 4:38 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
but at the price of 40-44 erg


[02/06/2023 4:39 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
And erg was at 2$ ? which was a very good drop

Yeah that’s one of then I think


[02/06/2023 5:06 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
these are her spoiled clones, be careful


[02/06/2023 5:06 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
they might attack you


[02/06/2023 5:07 PM] Kilver#0000
Is that what the hospital is for?

no, that one might be used once we add more movements for cybercitizens


[02/06/2023 5:08 PM] Kilver#0000
I can see another minigame happening in the hospital


[02/06/2023 5:08 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
speaking of minigames


[02/06/2023 5:09 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
if you have some concept idea what we could add as a minigame job, just write it in #💡┃ideas room 🙂


[02/06/2023 5:09 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
i would 100% welcome some ideas from the community


[02/06/2023 5:09 PM] Kilver#0000
Will do!


[02/06/2023 5:11 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
we have some ideas for the next jobs, but if community's concept idea will be faster to create for these upcoming weeks, we might just add those

[02/06/2023 5:16 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
People reported this bug a few times already, we will be starting with this, since it's the most annoying bug.  
It also happened to me, but I thought i'm having a problem. 

Sorry about that.


[02/06/2023 5:17 PM] CM Mongo#0000
I've been on for like 12 hours with no problems 😂


[02/06/2023 5:17 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
It always happens when you play the barman job


[02/06/2023 5:17 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Worst timing 😅


[02/06/2023 6:01 PM] lexymon#0000
so... when should an apartment appear ingame after buying it?


[02/06/2023 6:01 PM] lexymon#0000
block is confirmed


[02/06/2023 6:04 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Refresh the game page.
 We still need to add **auto-update** in the next update that will show you  your assets that you receive without refreshing site (real time) + notification about it.


[02/06/2023 6:05 PM] lexymon#0000
i did couple of times already :/


[02/06/2023 6:09 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
it's loading.... it's just the building that hasn't been added and the entry is in the middle of the barrier. 

Okay, don't worry about it, I can borrow you my medium apartment to test the apartment feature till we add the building (it should be added this week)

Just DM me, please.

We will be sending a gift to all the owners of the apartments who can't access the 6th building.


[02/06/2023 6:12 PM] lexymon#0000

[02/06/2023 8:02 PM] Cor#0000
and will the ergopixels have any role in the game ever?


[02/06/2023 8:02 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Yes, we will try with the proposal.


[02/06/2023 8:02 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
If community agrees, we will realize it.


[02/06/2023 8:02 PM] Cor#0000
ok


[02/06/2023 8:03 PM] Cor#0000
does it matter what rarity CC you play with?


[02/06/2023 8:04 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
At the current stage. The rarer ones receive higher daily rewards.

Can we see peoples apartments or only you?


[02/06/2023 10:01 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
only the owners of the apartments


[02/06/2023 10:01 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Apartment owners can only see their own apartments.


[02/06/2023 10:02 PM] CM Mongo#0000
inviting someone to your apartment could be cool xd


[02/06/2023 10:03 PM] Colombian#0000
If I had a penthouse, I would open it as a private art club. Depending on the rarity of artwork, could charge a small entrance fee. Or club membership lol


[02/06/2023 10:04 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
This would be dope. People could host their own drops for tickets 😄


[02/06/2023 10:05 PM] Colombian#0000
I was imaging other artists hosting their own artwork shows, indeed! Would be an excellent community engagement idea


[02/06/2023 10:05 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Can you share the idea in #💡┃ideas  room, please?

yah haha


[02/06/2023 10:07 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
It's because in #💡┃ideas room  we can't lose the ideas that easy as in general chat 😆

Low key was trying to flex my score 👀


[02/06/2023 10:47 PM] Colombian#0000
It’s all relative! The high score will be pushed up every day, as lvls increase.


[02/06/2023 10:47 PM] Colombian#0000
But that’s an excellent score!


[02/06/2023 10:49 PM] Chuck#0000
Oh I didn’t know that, very cool


[02/06/2023 10:50 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Yeah, the higher your skill job and skill barman are, the more points you can earn in a single game


[02/06/2023 10:50 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I can go up to 400 points now with 2 of my characters

not flexing tho

[02/06/2023 10:51 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
still 9 hours to go or so


[02/06/2023 10:52 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
first place only 12k points


[02/06/2023 11:07 PM] aradaiel#0000
someone lemme borrow some NFTs so I can up my score


[02/06/2023 11:08 PM] aradaiel#0000
Is the stamina on a 24 hour timer?


[02/06/2023 11:08 PM] Colombian#0000
be patient. In a week, your scores will be at least double what they are now


[02/06/2023 11:09 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
yessir. Stamina resets in 9 hours


[02/06/2023 11:09 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
along with leaderboard


[02/06/2023 11:09 PM] aradaiel#0000
ok, so it's not 24 hours from where I used it


[02/06/2023 11:09 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
We will be adding also timer for both claim rewards and stamina/leaderboard in the next update as other important things


[02/06/2023 11:10 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
No it's not. You can waste it 2 hours before the leaderboard refreshes and then any time after the refresh


[02/06/2023 11:10 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
No it's not. You can waste stamina 2 hours before the leaderboard refreshes and then any time after the refresh

We should have a call with the founder of skyharbor this week, so I will ask him about the audio NFTs support


[02/07/2023 6:05 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Morning all


[02/07/2023 6:10 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Don’t worry, they didn’t fully  disappear. 
They should be seen when the support will be available for them. 
At least that’s how I understood it.


[02/07/2023 6:10 AM] aradaiel#0000
Oh cool


[02/07/2023 6:12 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Also about the bug with seeing through citizens heads. We just need to add for the character sprites black backgrounds and they should fixed 😆 I will show you what I mean later today, I’m currently travelling to the work 🥲


[02/07/2023 6:12 AM] aradaiel#0000
I think I know what you mean, to make them not transparent


[02/07/2023 6:13 AM] aradaiel#0000
My guy looks like he has a buzzcut because of it, hah

cadebedouin,  i'm not really sure what you mean by this. We don't have any connection with Swamp Audio and all of our audioNFTs tracks are made by our music composer @matheo44. 
We don't use anything what they built. All of our audionfts are minted using auction house.

Maybe I am biased because I’m not a whale but I’m not a huge fan of the Top 3 “Best Players” being based on highest total score. It would make sense to me to have a statistic showing who averages the highest total score per run and rewarded consistency instead of sheer volume.

[02/07/2023 10:13 PM] Colombian#0000
Obviously this would incentivize those to achieve a higher barman lvl to optimize their runs


[02/07/2023 11:11 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
Once there is more things to do it will be much harder for them to keep up with all their citizens


[02/07/2023 11:55 PM] CM Mongo#0000
yeah could be something to look into, have it randomly chosen between top3 + the address with the highest avg score or something like that just speculation

Is the minting re-opened?


[02/08/2023 3:14 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
The address received a CyberCitizen NFT without a reward, since it's not 100% chance to receive also rewards such as apartments, cybereggs, serums and body parts.
It sent a Citizen + AudioNFT


[02/08/2023 3:14 PM] CM Mongo#0000

my head is spinning 😵‍💫


[02/09/2023 5:08 PM] Kilver#0000
The thing is I didn’t really managed to play this week at all so all my citizens are lvl 0. So I can’t score more than 330-340 points per round.


[02/09/2023 5:10 PM] Szabber#0000
Once reach 380.xx today, 3rd day i playing with the citizens.. Missed day one, i'm rookie on that day


[02/09/2023 5:17 PM] Kilver#0000

Lol wtf


[02/09/2023 10:18 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Havent had the chance to deep dive into the minigame. Do you get extra rewards? How much Cypx are you earning?


[02/09/2023 10:19 PM] Kilver#0000
I didn’t manage to get more than 340 so I assume I got 0 CYPX in total.


[02/09/2023 10:19 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
what? 😂


[02/09/2023 10:19 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
you are at maximum tier bro


[02/09/2023 10:19 PM] Kilver#0000
Isn’t that how it works?


[02/09/2023 10:22 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
all the points you have earned in these 24 hours are added together an it gives you a tier that you can see on the left side.
You passed the maximum tier, that means you get 111 cypx + 200 cypx for the first place (we also sending rewards for top 3 players)
The rewards are distributed daily once your points and leaderboard is restarted.

111 CYPX for passing 40,000 points*


[02/09/2023 10:23 PM] Kilver#0000
Oh. So I only need to do 40k.


[02/09/2023 10:24 PM] Kilver#0000
Does it reset every day?


[02/09/2023 10:24 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
well, thats the max we added into the reward tiers for public test.


[02/09/2023 10:25 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Yes, it restarted every day along with your stamina


[02/09/2023 10:25 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
reset*


[02/09/2023 10:28 PM] Kilver#0000
Good to know, thanks. I initially thought that Rewards Tires worked differently. Like if you get over 360 you get 1 CYPX, then after 720 you het 2 CYPX and so on.


[02/09/2023 10:28 PM] Colombian#0000

Anyway welcome! Any questions about the game, let me know! 🙂 We are still in public test to test our features and find as many bugs as we can. We will be adding way more activities and features such as mingames (like barman job), contests, autoupdate of nfts & balance, notifications,  and more... in upcoming weeks.

Just reported this. Already 2 people are having this issue.


[02/11/2023 8:33 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
But there shouldn't be an issue with receiving rewards. We were doing some improvements and sending tx is way faster than before. Check out the transactions

[02/12/2023 1:53 AM] iluvass2#0000
how much total ergo is needed to have


[02/12/2023 1:53 AM] iluvass2#0000
20 for mint


[02/12/2023 1:53 AM] iluvass2#0000
what about gas?


[02/12/2023 1:54 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
fees are generally .001 erg


[02/12/2023 1:54 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
welcome to ergo


[02/12/2023 1:55 AM] iluvass2#0000
and ihave some funds in sol any idea how to convert n send in ergo wallet?


[02/12/2023 1:55 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
pay attention on secondary markets though bc artists can claim royalties if you buy or sell


[02/12/2023 1:56 AM] iluvass2#0000
okey


[02/12/2023 1:56 AM] iluvass2#0000
im looking forward to to wave 3 mint only


[02/12/2023 1:56 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
i would convert sol to usdt and usdt to ergo on kucoin. then send to nautilus


[02/12/2023 1:57 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Yeah, or send sol to kucoin, swap to usdt and buy erg like that


[02/12/2023 1:57 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
*taxable transactions


[02/12/2023 1:57 AM] iluvass2#0000
yeahhbut they take alot...


[02/12/2023 1:57 AM] iluvass2#0000
this was my plan


[02/12/2023 1:57 AM] CM Mongo#0000
That way you only pay sol gas fees and erg gas fees to withdrawing ergo


[02/12/2023 1:57 AM] iluvass2#0000
hoping if there is any bridge


[02/12/2023 1:58 AM] CM Mongo#0000

So send 20 ERG to  9eXCfrmgJSuYKS6hf32snZHZYCFvVeAsBU6LigaKkd5hzjUB3Rf, or follow instructions here - https://cybercitizens.io/#mint


[02/12/2023 2:56 AM] iluvass2#0000
it is safe nah?


[02/12/2023 2:57 AM] CM Mongo#0000
and when you get a cybercitizen, https://spectrum.fi is where you can swap a tiny bit of ergo, maybe 0.1 to CYPX to make it so you can do stuff ingame

Did you receive it yet?


[02/12/2023 3:06 AM] CM Mongo#0000
check nautilus wallet, can take few mins


[02/12/2023 3:11 AM] iluvass2#0000
how to check my nft in wallet?


[02/12/2023 3:14 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Open up nautilus and go to the assets section, or you can go to ergopad.io and they have a dashbaord you can see NFTs on after connecting wallet


[02/12/2023 3:14 AM] iluvass2#0000

[02/12/2023 3:14 AM] iluvass2#0000

Nice, you'll be able to listen to that ingame


[02/12/2023 3:15 AM] CM Mongo#0000
https://playcyberverse.com is the game site, first youll need to grab a small bit of CYPX to enter


[02/12/2023 3:16 AM] iluvass2#0000
ihave .3 ergo left


[02/12/2023 3:16 AM] iluvass2#0000
how much is needed to play game


[02/12/2023 3:17 AM] CM Mongo#0000
not much, that'll be more than enough, swapping 0.15 to CYPX should give you enough


[02/12/2023 3:17 AM] CM Mongo#0000
and leave you enough for gas fees


[02/12/2023 3:18 AM] iluvass2#0000
did it n got 66 CYPX


[02/12/2023 3:19 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Yeah, that's more than enough, only need to send small bits to claim rewards and enter, for now that is


[02/12/2023 3:19 AM] CM Mongo#0000
also can see your ingame cybercitizen by going to #cybercitizens and typing !cc folllowed by the number your cc is


[02/12/2023 3:20 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Okay the website will be going down for a bit while I push changes, game site will be fine though so you can still play

You can play the barman minigame at the club, open up the map to see where it's at, you can see buildings you can enter with a red glow on the map, the bank you can visit and claim cypx every 24 hours , you get more the higher level your nft is and the higher the rarity score, there's a museum dedicated to ergo devs and if you own any apartments you can enter them ingame and decorate them, can check it all in #game-features


[02/12/2023 3:24 AM] iluvass2#0000
n how can i verify myself


[02/12/2023 3:24 AM] CM Mongo#0000

well we just released so not too much to do just yet, we want to fix up any bugs and whatnot, just be sure to claim your rewards every day from the bank as well, and well be releasing a bigger questboard next week sometime after resetting leaderboard and giving out some prizes, because I've got a few more quest ideas

noob alert. anyone could tell me if you could still claim rewards for your citizen from the bank and how to get there?


[02/12/2023 5:25 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Just take a look at the full mini map , you’ll see the bank , you can claim every day so no worries 🙂


[02/12/2023 5:26 AM] iluvass2#0000

[02/12/2023 5:26 AM] iluvass2#0000
where to check if i got something?


[02/12/2023 5:28 AM] CM Mongo#0000
You can check out the explorer https://explorer.ergoplatform.com

Put your wallet address in there and you should be able to see the transaction pending; sometimes block confirmation can take a while

:0_:


[02/12/2023 8:02 AM] Kilver#0000
Yeah. But doing only 1 bartending round gives you 1 CYPX. Using 1 energy can fund your log ins for 6-7 times.


[02/12/2023 8:03 AM] Rishabh#0000
Same question do we have to pay every time we connect our wallet ?


[02/12/2023 8:05 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Nope. After you close the game, you should be logged in for 6 hours.
This doesn't happen very often, it usually happens when we restart something, or push update. Currently working on transfering game on new server, so that might be the issue. 

However, you can claim daily rewards which are worth minimum 1 cypx and doing barman job rewards that can give you even more depends on how many points you gain daily.


[02/12/2023 8:06 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
We will be decreasing the fee for verification even more.  But even now, the fee is not really high.

I look forward to posting my nft in game apartment.   I have about 60 Champions to post in 1 room and about 30 It's a Bubble art to post in another room


[02/12/2023 9:37 AM] Samish#0000
Could almost be like a defi project if nft projects donated staking tokens if we post their art on the walls


[02/12/2023 9:38 AM] Kilver#0000
Might make a personal art museum out of one of my apartments too. 😁


[02/12/2023 9:39 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
imagine using penthouse for the museum 😄


[02/12/2023 9:39 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
that's almost as big as current museum


[02/12/2023 9:41 AM] Kilver#0000
I wonder who owns the penthouse


[02/12/2023 10:19 AM] Samish#0000
Yes a quiet penthouse owner


[02/12/2023 10:20 AM] Kilver#0000
Is it you?


[02/12/2023 10:20 AM] Samish#0000
No, I got 1 large and small on apartment sale


[02/12/2023 10:21 AM] Samish#0000
Then opend 2 more small on mint 3


[02/12/2023 10:22 AM] Kilver#0000
Nice! I also managed to get a med apartment from the mint.


[02/12/2023 10:22 AM] Samish#0000
It was lucky draw.  The penthouse person never spoke up


[02/12/2023 10:22 AM] Kilver#0000
And is not even for sale or anything.


[02/12/2023 10:23 AM] Kilver#0000
I hope is not lost on a random wallet


[02/12/2023 10:24 AM] Samish#0000

[02/12/2023 10:31 AM] Chioz#0000
was wondering if there could be a another job, like say in the harbor areas. a job that require 2 or more citizens


[02/12/2023 10:32 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Hey!


[02/12/2023 10:33 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
can you explain it a bit more? 👀


[02/12/2023 10:33 AM] Chioz#0000
not sure if trying to point the game in a more axie infinity style of earnings model, but thought it could be driving the need for more citizens higher up


[02/12/2023 10:34 AM] Chioz#0000
lets say there is a boat unloading event. they need 2 citizens with at least [str] to help unloading


[02/12/2023 10:35 AM] Chioz#0000
make sense?


[02/12/2023 10:37 AM] Chioz#0000
(Axie infinity had the model of having to buy at least 3 axies to play anything. Cybercitizens would need at least 1, but there could be certain jobs that require more, even if renting from other players in the sense of having a place one put citizens up for rent and people go there and add citizen to their workforce)


[02/12/2023 10:40 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
That is a cool.idea


[02/12/2023 10:40 AM] Chioz#0000
im not sure if im making sense here


[02/12/2023 10:41 AM] Kilver#0000
I see they way it could work. If the citizens could train various  attributes like strength, dexterity, intelligence etc and certain jobs requiring a certain lvl of skill to do.


[02/12/2023 10:42 AM] Chioz#0000
i think this drives need for owners of citizens to level them up to be more attractive for rent, and the need for newcomers to go and rent workforce for jobs that earns more


[02/12/2023 10:43 AM] Kilver#0000
Now, will selling a citizen on SH reset its skill lvl?


[02/12/2023 10:43 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
it wont


[02/12/2023 10:43 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
you can buy a citizen that has xp 500


[02/12/2023 10:44 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
etc


[02/12/2023 10:44 AM] Kilver#0000
That’s quite cool.


[02/12/2023 10:44 AM] Kilver#0000
That would make grinding lvls very attractive


[02/12/2023 10:44 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I think we tested it twice, but i dont remember anymore lol


[02/12/2023 10:46 AM] Chioz#0000
the setup done so far with the whole gameplay seem to lining up perfectly to make more jobs like the barman. I sure this has already been in the plans already 🙂

yes, we got some good suggestions for new minigames job.


[02/12/2023 10:48 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
i need to think more about this more 😆


[02/12/2023 10:50 AM] Chioz#0000
the axie infinity model also made possible to have people use their axie for free, provided the "renter" and the "lender" both get a share of the earnings. So with the utxo model of ergo, this is even better to organize considering the possibility of multiple payments in one tx.


[02/12/2023 10:52 AM] Chioz#0000
you and the team has done awesome work on this. i think you setting it up nicely for the next bull run 😄


[02/12/2023 10:58 AM] Thirdstryker#0000

[02/12/2023 11:04 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
The beauty or restoring wallets. As long as they have the seed phrase they can access the same address from a different wallet. Thats what i did with my yoroi instead of transferring everything


[02/12/2023 11:17 AM] Kilver#0000
Smart!


[02/12/2023 11:18 AM] Kilver#0000
I had to transfer my 42 erg from yoroi and it was the most painful thing ever, I almost gave up on them.

[02/12/2023 11:31 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000

daily rewards


[02/12/2023 11:35 AM] Chioz#0000
not sure if i understand, but i claimed the citizens in the bank. 
is this the process


[02/12/2023 11:35 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
yeah


[02/12/2023 11:35 AM] Chioz#0000
then yes 🙂


[02/12/2023 11:35 AM] Chioz#0000
got me some 160 cypx in wallet now


[02/12/2023 11:36 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
we still need to improve it with autoupdate of the balance, expected daily rewards, countdown etc..


[02/12/2023 11:38 AM] Chioz#0000
love it. 
i think the whole beta game is awesome for seeing how adding and removing jobs that can regulate the ingame economy


[02/12/2023 11:43 AM] Chioz#0000
can even have ergopixels as requiement for certain tasks... (like museum event from [date] to [date] )
or other ergo projects loaning their nfts if ergodinos were to roam the streets for some reason 😄

[02/12/2023 1:45 PM] Kilver#0000
In 10-15 years most jobs will be done by AI so better prepare ahead for it.

It’s helps having at least 1 person there keeping you company while you grind. 😁


[02/12/2023 9:36 PM] Colombian#0000
Especially when you have so many lol. I think I am at my limit of 6 CCs. 1 hour of barman duties every day plus the new mini games that will be dropped it seems like to much time to dedicate daily

We are still working on a solution for the random disconnection.  So the game can be turned off at any time for a couple of hours or the game may ask you for the fee again after joining back.

[02/14/2023 11:01 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
I have about 850 or so for 3.... so close!


[02/14/2023 11:01 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
If its consistent you need to play about 50 minigames for each character to level up


[02/14/2023 11:02 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
so 10 days worth


[02/14/2023 11:04 AM] Kilver#0000

Really sorry that you are experiencing this bug, We've working on a solution 2 days already. We are upgrading the server and it requires a bit more things to change + new update for fixing other bugs & new additions that community reports/suggested.
The update is expecting to be published within 2 days (max 3).


[02/14/2023 8:57 PM] iluvass2#0000
no p


[02/14/2023 9:01 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
There are a lot of things we've been working on actually. That's also the reason why we are so quiet.
This week we are pushing the update I talked about above and by the end of the month we hope to publish another bigger update.

Ah damn that 40k point mission! I wish I took a screen shot of that 50k one I did. XD That’s ok, it gives me the  motivation to go for it again.


[02/15/2023 7:38 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I have a screenshot of the leaderboard when there were 50k points 🤐


[02/15/2023 7:39 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Will do later today when I get home 🦾


[02/15/2023 7:39 AM] Kilver#0000

Hey, any interest in bringing Ergo Nft culture into Bitcoin, before the big Bitcoin Nft hypecycle begins? It's currently boring over there, 99% some eth nft copies. I tend to think Original Ergo creators and Ergo as a whole would benefit pr wise from an active btc ordinals squad. Since we have nothing too fear with superior chain capabilities, but a lot to share culturewise....


[02/15/2023 8:48 PM] Kilver#0000
Much appreciated! 😁


[02/15/2023 9:13 PM] CM Mongo#0000
well could be something to look into in the future but currently with the launch of our alpha and bug fixes and our plans for what’s next continue to remain priority so we can have a functioning and stable game for users as were a small team, also I’d need to look more into ordinals as I have zero clue how they work or anything like that lol


[02/16/2023 7:18 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Just read that audio of a wet fart sold for 280k on ordinals lol

[02/16/2023 5:50 PM] CM Mongo#0000
yeah, until ergo wallet integration is on crew3, then we can automate claiming reward quest etc by having it search for a tx


[02/16/2023 5:50 PM] CM Mongo#0000
but the quests to visit an area etc will always be manual

[02/21/2023 6:21 AM] stro#0000
ok how do i get started now. go ahead and buy an nft on skyharbor?


[02/21/2023 6:39 AM] Kilver#0000
Hi! As the game is in beta you would need a cyber citizen in your wallet to connect to the game and a small amount of CYPX. You can exchange ergo for CYPX on Spectrum.io. CYPX is extremely cheap and you will need to send 0.1xx amount to a specific address to log in to the game and confirm that you are the owner of the wallet.


[02/21/2023 6:40 AM] Kilver#0000
You can buy a citizen from Sky Harbor or mint one from the website.


[02/21/2023 6:41 AM] Kilver#0000
I also recommend checking out #┃official-links and the white paper, there is a lot of information there.


[02/21/2023 6:46 AM] stro#0000
So I just needa buy a cyber citizen from sky harbor?


[02/21/2023 6:46 AM] stro#0000
Kk I’ll read white paper


[02/21/2023 6:48 AM] stro#0000
or should i mint whats the diff


[02/21/2023 6:53 AM] stro#0000
bruh im so excited XD


[02/21/2023 6:54 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
minting gives you a chance of special drops: eggs, apartments, body parts, serums


[02/21/2023 6:54 AM] stro#0000
ok ima mint

[02/21/2023 7:04 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
you can check rarity in #cybercitizens


[02/21/2023 7:05 AM] stro#0000

[02/21/2023 7:37 AM] stro#0000
186 is cool


[02/21/2023 7:37 AM] stro#0000

[02/21/2023 7:42 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000

dang that character so fye


[02/21/2023 7:43 AM] stro#0000
what determines price


[02/21/2023 7:43 AM] stro#0000
its got a high rarity


[02/21/2023 7:44 AM] Kilver#0000
I guess it’s rank x/2081 also how clean it looks. It’s a bit subjective.


[02/21/2023 7:45 AM] Kilver#0000
I should probably let Pixel answer the questions about his own game. XD srry.


[02/21/2023 7:46 AM] stro#0000
so whats next i guess


[02/21/2023 7:47 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Well a lot of things. The less score rarity, the rarer. 
better rank = more daily rewards 
Also the higher your citizens level is in the game, the more benefits/bonuses you get (this should be added in our next update)


[02/21/2023 7:47 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000

For the game, keep in note we are still in testing version so some bugs may appear. #📃┃announcements check our last update announcement. I will be here in 8 hours to respond to any questions you have 🙂


[02/21/2023 7:58 AM] Kilver#0000

[02/21/2023 8:36 AM] stro#0000
true c:


[02/21/2023 8:37 AM] stro#0000
so i could technically play now , since i have a character


[02/21/2023 8:37 AM] Kilver#0000
Yes. You also need a bit of CYPX in your wallet.


[02/21/2023 8:37 AM] stro#0000
alright ill swap som


[02/21/2023 8:40 AM] Kilver#0000
You literally need like 0.1 CYPX to log in. And you get CYPX every day from your bank and by playing the bartender minigame


[02/21/2023 8:41 AM] stro#0000
so i only needa swap once


[02/21/2023 8:41 AM] stro#0000
to initially play


[02/21/2023 8:41 AM] stro#0000
then can start earning


[02/21/2023 8:41 AM] stro#0000
also, can i transfer these items to a new wallet


[02/21/2023 8:42 AM] Kilver#0000
The citizen needs to be on the wallet that you log in with


[02/21/2023 8:42 AM] stro#0000
ok so i can send all these items to a new wallet


[02/21/2023 8:42 AM] stro#0000
im makign a main wallet for the game


[02/21/2023 8:43 AM] stro#0000
cuz i imagine all items will keep going in it, so


[02/21/2023 8:43 AM] Kilver#0000
Also your citizen is rank 400 that mean she will generate you 4 CYPX every day

[02/21/2023 9:32 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000

[02/21/2023 9:34 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000

[02/21/2023 9:34 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
The better and rarer your citizen is, the higher rewards you can get


[02/21/2023 9:34 AM] stro#0000
ya the bot is down

[02/21/2023 9:37 AM] stro#0000
in the future yall gonna try to automate it?


[02/21/2023 9:37 AM] stro#0000
so users dont have to sign tx


[02/21/2023 9:37 AM] stro#0000
and like interact with wallet while in game


[02/21/2023 9:37 AM] stro#0000
ohhh so when u log in it claims per ur nft?


[02/21/2023 9:37 AM] stro#0000
so because i have 2 it claims for both ?


[02/21/2023 9:38 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
You connect your wallet, go to bank, claim rewards and it automatically sends you rewards for all citizens


[02/21/2023 9:38 AM] stro#0000
ya i did


[02/21/2023 9:38 AM] stro#0000
i have 2 nfts tho so i was jus clarifying that it claims for both


[02/21/2023 9:39 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Yah 🙂


[02/21/2023 9:39 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
It would be annoying to claim rewards for each citizen individually 😁


[02/21/2023 9:39 AM] stro#0000
what i was saying tho, eventually are yall gonna work on having it so u dont have to send a tx to interact?


[02/21/2023 9:44 AM] stro#0000
dan i jus got 6 CYPX from daily


[02/21/2023 9:45 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
We haven’t thought about it yet. The reason we made it as a daily rewards is, so people join the game and have to do some activity such as go to the bank and claim the rewards. 😅
However, we are still at the early stage so it can change in upcoming months. 
You can also play a barman game to earn some more cypx  from the specific reward tier you earn and also if you are top 3 places you are getting big bonus of cypx 200/150/100 cypx (1st/2nd/3rd). The rewards are calculated together for all citizens and refreshed daily after the rewards are distributed.


[02/21/2023 9:46 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
More features will be added soon - upcoming 2-3 weeks along with new mini game job

[02/21/2023 10:22 AM] Kilver#0000
At the moment you can’t. The mint was long ago, even before I joined the community. But there will be another mint in the future.


[02/21/2023 10:23 AM] Kilver#0000
So sky harbor is the only place where you can get an apartment at the moment.

Your citizens produce an amount of CYPX per day. Eventually CYPX would have a lot of use cases. To purchase anything on the market, audio nfts, crafting etc.


[02/21/2023 12:21 PM] Kilver#0000
I think even the casino would accept CYPX for gambling at some point. Not not 100% sure.

What is the point of leveling your character? What's the benefits?


[02/21/2023 12:39 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
For levelling up = a bonus for daily rewards (to be implemented), and more benefits will be implemented during the whole year. Our first benefit will be implemented for lvl 1 citizens next update along with other features that are being in the work

E interacts with the bar. WASD moves up and down the inventory, E selects drink, walk up to the customer with that drink and press E again.  If you open up the wrong inventory press X to close.

Make sure you have the keyboard plugged into the computer to play


[02/22/2023 1:48 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Also can go to #verify-your-citizen  and type !verify followed by the address your citizen is on to get the cybercitizen role


[02/22/2023 4:55 AM] stro#0000
how does it verify its me... anyone could use my public address


[02/22/2023 5:00 AM] CM Mongo#0000
well that’s true, this is why the role isn’t really tied to anything special per day , just let’s us know you’ve purchased one , and ideally you’d verify it before someone else but even if someone did verify  your address before you tried to verify it , it would tell you you’ve already verified in which case we could tell who owns it by having them send  a super small amount to prove they own it ,


[02/22/2023 5:04 AM] stro#0000
ah ok

[02/22/2023 11:37 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
I win everyday. But I think the dynamics should change to give people a chance to win. I propose a lottery system. The more characters you play the more likely you win. But everyone still has a chance


[02/22/2023 11:59 AM] Kilver#0000
To get 40.000 points you need to play for around 5 hours with around 23-24 citizens depending of what scored you get. Even if I had 100 citizens I would not have enough time in a day to play with all of them. I think the game is balanced. Yes you won’t get on top 3 with 4-5 citizens unfortunately but 10 citizens will get you a minimum 15000 points a day. I think a lottery system if fair but takes the fun away from competing against each other.

[02/22/2023 12:02 PM] Kilver#0000
Maybe add a leaderboard for the highest score achieved that week and that way it doesn’t matter how many citizens you have.


[02/22/2023 12:02 PM] Kilver#0000
Maybe add a leaderboard for the highest score achieved that week in a single round and that way it doesn’t matter how many citizens you have.


[02/22/2023 12:05 PM] Kilver#0000
I’ll write that down in the idea channel.

id like that!


[02/22/2023 3:26 PM] HeRo#0000
I think there should be a leaderboard for each minigame, so you still have a chance of winning.


[02/22/2023 3:30 PM] HeRo#0000
Job skill work in all minigames that are "Job" type


[02/22/2023 3:30 PM] Kilver#0000
I would assume each minigame would have their own leaderboard. I guess that’s a solution too. You can’t be in top 3 of every minigame there are not enough hours in the day.


[02/22/2023 3:31 PM] HeRo#0000
That is what we have planned from the start.


[02/22/2023 3:31 PM] Kilver#0000

Freezing rain? Like hail?


[02/22/2023 6:48 PM] CM Mongo#0000
uhhh not exactly lol, like it’s just cold enough that the rain is liquid as it’s coming down but then the ground is cold enough so it freezes right when it hits the ground so everything gets coated in ice lol


[02/22/2023 6:48 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Power lines too which is why I guess my power is flickering lol

The whitepaper will definitely help you learn more about the project and our upcoming plans. Keep in mind that we update the whitepaper whenever we complete the current plans in our roadmap section (in the whitepaper).

The current version of the game is to allow cybercitizen holders to try out the game , have fun playing and earn some tokens, even though the game is in a **test** release. 

Another advantage of early play is that people can level up their character now, and the cybercitizen level will remain even when the game offers more features.  When we add a marketplace to the game, buyers will also be able to see the LVL and XP of the cybercitizen NFT before they buy a any, because the LEVELS and XP will stay on the NFT - even if you send it to someone else.

The downside of playing in the early version is that a lot of bugs can appear and sometimes can even trigger you. For example, a lot of people have the problem of getting randomly kicked while playing. This example is the biggest bug we are currently trying to fix, as most of the smaller ones have already been fixed.  So yes, there may be some bugs as we told everyone before connecting wallet to the game.
Also, there aren't many tutorials on how to play the game, but based on your feedback we will upload short videos explaining how to play the game.

[02/23/2023 3:02 AM] stro#0000
havent been doing my dailies.. how does it work? is it a server time?


[02/23/2023 3:06 AM] stro#0000
or is it based on when i did it? should be server time


[02/23/2023 3:06 AM] CM Mongo#0000
pixel will be able to tell you exact times but i think now after you claim rewards it should show a countdown for the reset time


[02/23/2023 3:06 AM] CM Mongo#0000
It’s based off server time


[02/23/2023 3:06 AM] stro#0000
ya it does now


[02/23/2023 3:07 AM] CM Mongo#0000
So you could wait until the last minute and claim them


[02/23/2023 3:07 AM] CM Mongo#0000
And then claim them again


[02/23/2023 3:07 AM] stro#0000

You really don’t pay attention don’t you. XD in #game-features  it tells you how to play the game as we pointed out yesterday.

[02/23/2023 7:17 AM] Kilver#0000
It takes a bit of practice but you’ll get the hang of it.


[02/23/2023 7:25 AM] stro#0000
so i see we have some stats.. any feature that use em? str etc


[02/23/2023 7:26 AM] stro#0000
pvp / multiplayer in future would be fun.. battling and put a stake on the winner,...


[02/23/2023 7:28 AM] Kilver#0000
Stats and multiplayer are coming in the future. A pvp arena/ battlegrounds is still being discussed.


[02/23/2023 7:31 AM] stro#0000

[02/23/2023 7:36 AM] stro#0000
more in docs?


[02/23/2023 7:41 AM] Kilver#0000
Not much. https://docs.cyberversegame.io/whitepaper-v3./cyberverse-guide/real-estate at the moment you can decorate them and make them your own.

But there will be another apartment mint in the future


[02/23/2023 8:56 AM] stro#0000

[02/23/2023 8:56 AM] stro#0000
?


[02/23/2023 8:57 AM] Kilver#0000
I wasn’t around for the initial apartment mint but I believe it was 44Erg per mint. Dunno what the future one will be.

[02/23/2023 7:12 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
I still have power but the internet was on and off yday


[02/23/2023 7:33 PM] Kilver#0000
can I change the address that I play from?


[02/23/2023 7:34 PM] Kilver#0000
I want to send the citizens that i play with to a separate address.


[02/23/2023 7:35 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Yeah you should be able too , just send them over and connect with that wallet


[02/23/2023 7:35 PM] Kilver#0000
and keep the ones that I don't play with on a different one


[02/23/2023 7:36 PM] Kilver#0000
when I go to the game page it only prompts the old address


[02/23/2023 7:36 PM] CM Mongo#0000
need to go into nautilus and connected dapps and delete our site


[02/23/2023 7:36 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Then it’ll prompt the pop up to select


[02/23/2023 7:37 PM] Kilver#0000

[02/24/2023 4:42 AM] CM Mongo#0000
@Mr.Pixel can look into that when he's up


[02/24/2023 4:42 AM] stro#0000

[02/24/2023 4:43 AM] CM Mongo#0000
if you have nautilus wallet it should auto mint now 😄


[02/24/2023 4:43 AM] CM Mongo#0000

[02/24/2023 4:49 AM] CM Mongo#0000
he should be able to reimburse you when hes back on, did you want it sent back to the address it came from ?


[02/24/2023 4:49 AM] stro#0000

[02/24/2023 4:49 AM] stro#0000

[02/24/2023 4:50 AM] stro#0000

[02/24/2023 4:50 AM] stro#0000
but yeah i guess moral of this story is, even non headless users can make mistakes.. LOL we definitely need to simplify this authentication process


[02/24/2023 4:50 AM] CM Mongo#0000
yeah whatever pixel decides, I think he'll most likely just send it back then youll be able to mint , yeah its a bit rough for the average user right now lol

I can work whenever I want pree lose schedule .. kinda a night owl :c


[02/24/2023 4:39 PM] stro#0000
This game requires much less  time and effort than if I were to sit down and play ps5 for an hour at night


[02/24/2023 4:39 PM] CM Mongo#0000
think theres roughly around 25-30 people who go on daily


[02/24/2023 4:54 PM] Kilver#0000
Yeah. 10 mins per citizen means I can play probably with 6 citizens a day after work.


[02/24/2023 5:59 PM] CM Mongo#0000

ima mint few more im tryna get a rare fam LOL


[02/25/2023 4:38 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Gl!!! And getting there haha , levelling up citizens in the barman skill also helps raise the points you can get , gives small point multiplier


[02/25/2023 4:39 AM] stro#0000
so lets say i ahd like 10 characters, to maximize it id need to do 5 barman repeats on each character? LOL


[02/25/2023 4:40 AM] stro#0000
so 50 reps, since stamina is daily recharge


[02/25/2023 4:41 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Haha yeah , if you wanted to try and play on everyone you own , but if you own a lot that’s obviously not super realistic like if you own 30+, but it does increase your daily bank claim when you have more


[02/25/2023 4:42 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Plus when we add more games each one will take a stamina


[02/25/2023 4:43 AM] stro#0000

Yeah that’s crazy.


[02/25/2023 11:46 AM] Kilver#0000
But fair. The more you grind the higher your score gets. I always liked games that you get out what you put in.

had some screw ups and long distance walks lol


[02/25/2023 1:58 PM] lexymon#0000
question: do we only get the barman game related cypx if we claim the daily rewards in the bank?


[02/25/2023 2:01 PM] Kilver#0000
They should be 2 separate things I’m assuming.


[02/25/2023 2:04 PM] lexymon#0000
just asking because usually the distributionis 8am utc-ish and didnt happen yet today


[02/25/2023 2:05 PM] lexymon#0000
and i didnt walked to the bank yesterday because i was lazy


[02/25/2023 2:05 PM] lexymon#0000
lol


[02/25/2023 3:02 PM] CM Mongo#0000
They should be separate


[02/25/2023 3:08 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

[02/26/2023 9:56 AM] 3rdstryker#0000
both 🙂


[02/26/2023 10:02 AM] Kilver#0000
I’m sure the boys are hard at work towards a new update and in general proper are looking towards the next CPI data and eventually the next FOMC meeting to see what the FED will do regarding interest rates. A lot of people are expecting bearish news so the FED saying that the plan is not changing might be a very bullish sign. So March and May are quite important news months. Until then we chill.

I'm so excited to see what's coming up with this project, my favorite out of all my investments


[02/26/2023 10:15 AM] Kilver#0000
Absolutely! The first project I actually don’t regret ape-ing into.


[02/26/2023 10:16 AM] Kilver#0000
Bought myself apartments, minted tons of citizens and cleaned out everyone who was selling white listed CYPX tokens.


[02/26/2023 10:18 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
I wish I knew about the project when the apartment mint was happening lol


[02/26/2023 10:19 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
I only have a one apartment, medium, spent I think 150 erg


[02/26/2023 10:20 AM] Kilver#0000
I wasn’t around for the apartment mint either


[02/26/2023 11:06 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Don't worry, we're still building. Lots of events coming up in March for our project. If everything goes well, next update should bring 4-6 new activities to the game. 
I've been a bit busy with IRL and family events so I haven't really been active on discord, sorry about that.


[02/26/2023 11:31 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
4-6? Wow 😳


[02/26/2023 11:36 AM] lexymon#0000
4-6?! do you want us to give up RL?

do you need cypx to play?


[02/27/2023 1:57 AM] aradaiel#0000
no, you'll earn enough playing the bar game once to last you pretty much forever


[02/27/2023 2:03 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Yeah just a very small amount to get in


[02/27/2023 2:16 AM] Xizzle4Shizzle#0000
Oh cool


[02/27/2023 2:16 AM] Xizzle4Shizzle#0000
Just for in the future might be cool for new ppl to only need a citezin to start playing


[02/27/2023 2:16 AM] Xizzle4Shizzle#0000
Remove as much barriers for onboarding as possible


[02/27/2023 2:18 AM] mongocm#0000
Yeah we do plan on having it so anyone can enter , even without a citizen but having one would give you  more rewards , access to areas etc, it’s still up for speculation


[02/27/2023 2:22 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
And look cooler 😎


[02/27/2023 2:22 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
Right now it's beta, so only for citizens


[02/27/2023 2:23 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Yeah , the testing is closed to holders of citizens only


[02/27/2023 4:17 AM] Xizzle4Shizzle#0000
Hi i connected my wallet and sent the cypx but the timer went to zero and nothing happened so i refreshed and it's asking me to send more?


[02/27/2023 4:18 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
You might have to do it again, make sure you send cypx not ergo


[02/27/2023 4:18 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Hmm it should let you in once you send the required amount , did you send cypx ?


[02/27/2023 4:18 AM] Xizzle4Shizzle#0000
yeah i send cypx


[02/27/2023 4:18 AM] Xizzle4Shizzle#0000
yeah i sent cypx


[02/27/2023 4:19 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Yeah I do see you sent 0.1209


[02/27/2023 4:20 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Could you try one more time ?


[02/27/2023 4:23 AM] Xizzle4Shizzle#0000
yeah i did


[02/27/2023 4:24 AM] Xizzle4Shizzle#0000
i sent 0.1748 this time


[02/27/2023 4:24 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Did you get in ?


[02/27/2023 4:24 AM] Xizzle4Shizzle#0000
do i get let in after the countdown? 😅


[02/27/2023 4:25 AM] Xizzle4Shizzle#0000
also whats with the sending cypx?


[02/27/2023 4:25 AM] Xizzle4Shizzle#0000
Shouldn't the nft in your wallet be enough?


[02/27/2023 4:26 AM] CM Mongo#0000
hmm no, it should let you in a few moments after you send it , let me see if the node that handles that is okay , when you send the cypx it also sends the wallet data over of any nfts you have , the cypx is our method of ensuring people can’t send fake data and trick the server into thinking they own said nfts , but it’s just an early version and will be updated to be smoother for users


[02/27/2023 4:28 AM] CM Mongo#0000
hmm, I was able to get in just now by sending the CYPX 😅


[02/27/2023 4:30 AM] Xizzle4Shizzle#0000
oh ok


[02/27/2023 4:31 AM] Xizzle4Shizzle#0000
cbf doing this a third time 😅


[02/27/2023 4:31 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Maybe like the verification, third times the charm? 😄


[02/27/2023 4:32 AM] CM Mongo#0000
if that doesn't work, can you go into the dev tools for the browser and then go into the network tab and delete the cookies and localstorage and then try again


[02/27/2023 4:33 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Also be sure you are sending it from the wallet you connect with, sometimes opening nautilus with multiple wallets will send you to a random one


[02/27/2023 4:49 AM] Xizzle4Shizzle#0000
yeah doesnt work


[02/27/2023 4:53 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Hmm, can you DM me

27 erg for a white egg. Was that you @stro?


[02/27/2023 9:12 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
Someone sold a white egg that low?


[02/27/2023 9:12 AM] Kilver#0000
Yeah.


[02/27/2023 9:13 AM] Kilver#0000
I mean congrats to the buyer I guess.


[02/27/2023 9:13 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
I'm so confused


[02/27/2023 9:16 AM] Kilver#0000
Yeah me too. You only need to look at the activity tab and see that 2 weeks ago a golden egg sold for 28 Erg which is dirt cheap. I guess the seller didn’t bother to look at the egg chart. Probably because no other white egg got sold before on SH.


[02/27/2023 12:08 PM] stro#0000
relic for 27? not me


[02/27/2023 12:08 PM] stro#0000

Hello @Mr.Pixel


[02/27/2023 12:17 PM] stro#0000
Good morning


[02/27/2023 12:18 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
It was the one listed for 60 for so long....was hoping they would lower it a bit, but my God!


[02/27/2023 12:20 PM] stro#0000
This my first time I minted and had an issue


[02/27/2023 12:20 PM] stro#0000
Btw


[02/27/2023 12:20 PM] stro#0000
My 4th mint


[02/27/2023 12:21 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Did it get sent to correct address?


[02/27/2023 12:21 PM] stro#0000
Yes


[02/27/2023 12:21 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I only ask because I know the it doesn't always copy address when trying to on website and sometimes you end up pasting something else in wallet


[02/27/2023 12:22 PM] stro#0000
Not makin that same mistake twice


[02/27/2023 12:22 PM] stro#0000
😅


[02/27/2023 12:22 PM] stro#0000
I already sent 20erg to the login address once 😂😂


[02/27/2023 12:22 PM] stro#0000
They sent it back


[02/27/2023 12:22 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I'm sure they will get it squared away


[02/27/2023 12:23 PM] stro#0000
It was only 4h ago


[02/27/2023 12:23 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I will fix it when i get home. I’m at the work 😭


[02/27/2023 12:23 PM] stro#0000

[02/27/2023 12:23 PM] stro#0000

[02/27/2023 1:07 PM] Kilver#0000

[02/27/2023 1:09 PM] Kilver#0000
I paid 90 erg for a diamond egg to finish my collection, now this makes me look quite foolish


[02/27/2023 1:10 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Chalk it up to the cost of greatness


[02/27/2023 1:11 PM] Kilver#0000

[02/27/2023 4:47 PM] Kilver#0000
But to be fair unless I’m getting rewarded for going past 40 k points I’m not doing it again.  50k+ points is a lot to grind in a day

[02/27/2023 9:09 PM] Kilver#0000
Will we eventually get the option to choose what wallet we want to connect to the game with? Atm the only way to switch the wallet is to go on settings and delete the page from apps.


[02/27/2023 10:11 PM] stro#0000

[03/01/2023 12:07 PM] stro#0000

[03/01/2023 12:07 PM] Kilver#0000
Ok.


[03/01/2023 12:07 PM] stro#0000
It can change?


[03/01/2023 12:08 PM] Kilver#0000
I assume so. With the body parts upgrades is my guess.


[03/01/2023 12:08 PM] Kilver#0000
Getting an upgrade from gold arm to diamond must increase rarity imo

Don’t know. Need to wait for an official update.


[03/01/2023 12:10 PM] Kilver#0000
I think this talks about the amount not the whole system. We will still get rewards for holding citizens but the amount will be tweaked


[03/01/2023 12:11 PM] stro#0000
May hold out on buying fro market place till this is solidified.. any change will affect pricing whether they increase the amount of CYPX rewarded of decrease it

[03/01/2023 12:12 PM] Kilver#0000
Imo the reward system looks quite fair. I highly doubt it would be lowered.


[03/01/2023 12:13 PM] stro#0000

I would rather buy a clean looking 1800/2081 citizen than a 100/2081 that looks bad.


[03/01/2023 12:16 PM] stro#0000
What about top 10


[03/01/2023 12:16 PM] stro#0000
Do u hav any


[03/01/2023 12:17 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I was thinking same thing...also b/c robotic legs aren't in metadata and serum usage...I believe @Mr.Pixel said it wasn't in the plans though


[03/01/2023 12:18 PM] Kilver#0000
Nop 25 is my highest


[03/01/2023 12:19 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
GM, BTW


[03/01/2023 12:19 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
So rude of me


[03/01/2023 12:19 PM] Kilver#0000
So you say that serums and body part upgrades won’t affect the rarity?


[03/01/2023 12:19 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
That was my understanding of his response


[03/01/2023 12:19 PM] Kilver#0000
Umm…


[03/01/2023 12:20 PM] Kilver#0000
I guess we will see


[03/01/2023 12:20 PM] Kilver#0000
GM btw!


[03/01/2023 12:21 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Maybe upgrades will be in-game only and can be applied and taken off character at will??


[03/01/2023 12:21 PM] stro#0000
Anyone has 1061


[03/01/2023 12:21 PM] stro#0000
#1


[03/01/2023 12:21 PM] stro#0000
Looks so nice


[03/01/2023 12:21 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Though I thought I remember something about serums making a new character all together and needing a remint


[03/01/2023 12:22 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I got #5


[03/01/2023 12:22 PM] stro#0000
Anyone know if 1061 is up still


[03/01/2023 12:23 PM] stro#0000
Wonder how much it’d be worth


[03/01/2023 12:23 PM] stro#0000
Did u mint it


[03/01/2023 12:23 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Yeah...its been minted I believe


[03/01/2023 12:23 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Traded for it


[03/01/2023 12:24 PM] Kilver#0000
Dunno who has it tho


[03/01/2023 12:24 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I dont think any robots have sold on open market, so tough guessing price for it


[03/01/2023 12:26 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I got mine for 140 $ERG and a Gen 0 Goat. That may be the only "valuation" available that I know of

[03/01/2023 12:49 PM] Kilver#0000
I get I think 279 CYPX from my citizens daily but that nothing compared to 3700 CYPX I get daily from buying the white list CYPX tokens.


[03/01/2023 12:50 PM] stro#0000
3700 daily how


[03/01/2023 12:50 PM] Kilver#0000
I bought 400k CYPX white list tokens.


[03/01/2023 12:50 PM] stro#0000
idk what that is lol


[03/01/2023 12:52 PM] Kilver#0000
When CYPX was launched on Ergopad, ergopad stakes got a very good price on CYPX whitelist tokens before the token went live. The only thing is that I got my tokens cheap but I don’t have access to them. I get them daily instead. It’s an anti dump measure.

[03/03/2023 5:28 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
After you type !q walletaddress, the bot checks if you hold an nft, so that's basically the only verification you need to qualify for the airdrop

[03/04/2023 10:05 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
The bot was just stuck, because we have all of our discord features in 1 bot and when 1 thing stops working, all features in that bot will get stuck. 
In this case, I think skyharbor API is down and that's why the bot got stuck. (We used their api for sale alerts feature) - At least nothing is loading on skyharbor to us.

[03/06/2023 8:56 AM] lexymon#0000
I think these recent trend of all ergo projects going crosschain on Cardano is a slippery slope. We should convince more cardanians to come over to ergo instead, but that’s only my two cypx 😉


[03/06/2023 10:22 AM] Kilver#0000
One big reason I have invested in Ergo over Cardano is market cap and coin supply. Cardano needs 1.2 trillion market cap to do a 100x. Ergo needs 10 Billion Market cap to do a 100x. Which one is more plausible? 12 Billion to 1.2 Trillion next bullrun or 100 million to 10 Billion?


[03/06/2023 10:25 AM] Kilver#0000
Of course Caradano is already well established in the crypto community and Ergo is just one of many small ambitious project pushing it’s way to the top but I trust Ergo will make it. High risk high reward and if I don’t make a penny out of it will go out knowing I took a change on something I truly believe in.

[03/06/2023 10:34 AM] lexymon#0000
Same… Ergo is criminally undervalued or many other blockchains are overvalued. Pick what you prefer 😂 but I think if there will be a new bull run, Ergo is positioned well, because it has so much more to offer now. That’s why I’m so grateful for all the devs who spend their time building on Ergo (and not Cardano!!) 😂

[03/07/2023 7:43 PM] Ody#0000
Having a metaverse where you can be and that allow you to escape from a certain reallity  would be great!


[03/07/2023 7:44 PM] Ody#0000
having some bootcamp on the metaverse


[03/07/2023 7:49 PM] Ody#0000
some mix ergo meetup (will happen on this cyberverse and in real life), 
someone in the metaverse could offer a bear to someone physical present at the meetup


[03/07/2023 7:51 PM] Ody#0000
going to school in the metaverse (DeCo having an appartment in the cyberverse )


[03/07/2023 7:52 PM] Ody#0000

[03/07/2023 7:52 PM] Kilver#0000

[03/07/2023 8:12 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Hey! We appreciate that! 
I really like your vision about the project. 🙂 We plan to add multiplayer in the future, but we need more time. We are still at the start with the game and its features and we don't want to rush the process. 

Our priority now is to make workable product with as many features as possible for players to enjoy the game and not get bored after 1 week of playing. 😄 

About the decentralization, it's honestly really hard to make a game fully decentralized, but we will be trying to push this way once we are ready to do it so.

hahaha I was totally just thinking like should I mint one ? There’s still two apartments ….


[03/08/2023 7:55 AM] Bonzo#0000
I think so.. I checked th eaddress before I started minting.  3 mints later.. no apartment


[03/08/2023 8:00 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
You can see on our website how many NFT rewards  are left. The rewards that have the least supply have  very small % chance to get.

Someone minted 30 NFTs and got no apartments, someone minted 6 and got 2 apartments as a rewards.


[03/08/2023 8:03 AM] Bonzo#0000
Are you saying there's no appartment left?


[03/08/2023 8:03 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
There are 2 apartments left

[03/08/2023 8:04 AM] Bonzo#0000
Is it just me or does the website say there's 4 appartments left?

it only happens when people buy nfts and it only stays like that for a bit , trying to figure out why lol

yup. It's updated on my end now too


[03/08/2023 8:08 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Yeah it happens when a user buys an nft , and not sure , tgink it makes a request to check nfts in the middle of sending one out and if it does it then it messes up until the transaction is done and it updates again, updates every 10 seconds


[03/08/2023 8:09 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Well Is 3 am here so I shall fix it tomorrow 😅

The api is buggy, when there is a tx pending for minting, not sure? It’s fine for me till it’s tx pending 😆

Thank for the info 👍🏽
I'm good, have been spending most of my discord quota on Algorand projects lately. Right now there's a major hacking attack related to a popular wallet that has drained a lot people's funds. I luckily secured my wallets before I got hit but several web3 friends have had 1000s of $ worth of funds stolen. Shitty situation, hope it gets resolved soon.

I minted a few cybercitizens yesterday, but a few of them have the image apparently not loading. Do you need the references?


[03/09/2023 1:50 PM] Kilver#0000
@Mr.Pixel  @CM Mongo


[03/09/2023 3:12 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Hey! How are you doing?
As for the not loading problem, it's an ipfs issue, so it shouldn't be a problem with NFT in general.
Ipfs is where all the images of the NFTs are hosted, sometimes it gets I guess laggy so some pictures don't load, it should load if you give it enough time. Keep us updated, please. 

 Even I have that problem with some NFTs from different collections.😅 

That's why we've added a bot that will instantly show you the nfts in #cybercitizens using **!c citizen's_number**
if you type** !cc citizen's_number**, you can see ingame version of the NFTs.

Is there some high ranks listed for a good price on skyharbor?


[03/09/2023 4:57 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
No at the moment. But in our first real estate drop we gave all cybercitizen holders a whitelist access and they could mint an apartment for a bit cheaper mint price. Only 1 Apartment NFT during whitelist tho.


[03/09/2023 4:57 PM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0000

or add them to your wiki or to a faq channel


[03/09/2023 5:25 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
**Not many listed, any future mints for this?**
There will be more real estate drops in the future with not just apartments. 
**How do you play this game? a software to download?**
You don't have to download the game. It's playable on a browser. You only need nautilus wallet and CyberCitizen NFT.
**What happens if you have only the citizen and not an appartment?**
You can play without an apartment. The apartment is an extra feature you can access by owning an NFT.
**Is there still some rare to be minted?**
I would have to check it out.  You can see all the NFTs remaining in this wave here: https://www.ergogallery.com/share/?address=9fFMwTZohTvEAxwtcUsDCKt7sTsJJccsVeR5FreGVVQgKPWMZkp
**Who does your music? is it original and created only for the collection?**
@matheo44 creates all our tracks and the tracks are created only for the collection. 
**What's the goal of the game?**
The goal is to have a game where people can explore, play, have fun or grind  and earn.🦾   We also want to connect projects building on ergo with our game such as marketplace (skyharbor) and many more... Later we want to expand to multiplayer.
**What happens to the daily rewards if you don't claim them daily? Do you have to stake the NFTs to start cumulating?**
At the current daily rewards feature version, people needs to claim rewards daily. If you don't claim your rewards will just disappear.
**Is there going to be a wave 4?**
There will be no Wave 4. The waves were only created because of the large number of NFTs in this collection. 
**Is the CYPX token listed on a dex?**
CYPX is listed on Spectrum Finance (DEX) :  https://app.spectrum.fi/ergo/swap?base=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000&quote=01dce8a5632d19799950ff90bca3b5d0ca3ebfa8aaafd06f0cc6dd1e97150e7f&initialPoolId=7f1759300b19287adbbcd03c877eae6c6de60f4c2962b1fc5ae2c6e2a684220c

The game is expected to be resumed later this month. All CyberCitizens holders have had the opportunity to play the game for most of January and earn tokens by playing our first mini-game (Bartender) or by claiming daily rewards.

When the game is live, you go to the bank and claim the rewards daily.

Here is a short tutorial how it works:

We plan more improvements for claiming rewards in upcoming weeks. Our priority now is to make workable product with fixed main bugs and add more features/activities.


[03/09/2023 9:36 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Thank you very much! It means a lot to us. We are constantly trying to build utilities for our NFTs, ideas and events for our community and hope to continue to do so.

Wouldn't that be dope!


[03/10/2023 12:50 AM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0000
I'll mint another 10 to get to 150


[03/10/2023 12:50 AM] slapshottwelve#0000

[03/10/2023 12:51 AM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0000

[03/10/2023 12:51 AM] slapshottwelve#0000

[03/10/2023 12:51 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Would be quite impressive!


[03/10/2023 12:52 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000
And that much closer to hatching event and serum usage!


[03/10/2023 12:53 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000

yeah realized that the counts were not accurate at all because they were being bought so fast lol


[03/10/2023 12:57 AM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#0000
Definitely glad I've held onto my rare serum


[03/10/2023 12:57 AM] CM Mongo#0000
at this rate the last nfts will get an egg for sure no? I dont think any rewards woudl be left


[03/10/2023 12:57 AM] CM Mongo#0000
think theyre suppose to be given out by the time it hits 0, unless im mistaken lol


[03/10/2023 12:58 AM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#0000

[03/10/2023 12:58 AM] slapshottwelve#0000

[03/10/2023 1:08 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
hard to tell whats left.  nothing has updated after the most recent confirmations lol


[03/10/2023 1:09 AM] CM Mongo#0000
haha yeah thats true as well, takes a bit for it to update with blocktimes


[03/10/2023 1:15 AM] CM Mongo#0000
woah 54 ccs and 52 eggs


[03/10/2023 1:15 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
and 2 body parts


[03/10/2023 1:16 AM] CM Mongo#0000
yeah no one has snagged those


[03/10/2023 1:16 AM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0000
i snagged one I think


[03/10/2023 1:17 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
and actually 9 mints unconfirmed with no eggs


[03/10/2023 1:17 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
.....


[03/10/2023 1:17 AM] CM Mongo#0000
oo , yeah think there was 4 in total, 2 were gotten


[03/10/2023 1:17 AM] CM Mongo#0000
hopefully the processor is set up to refund once its sold out or pixel will have some work to do tomorrow lol


[03/10/2023 1:18 AM] CM Mongo#0000
oh shit


[03/10/2023 1:18 AM] CM Mongo#0000
35


[03/10/2023 1:18 AM] CM Mongo#0000
seems the eggs don't go lol


[03/10/2023 1:18 AM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0000
there's more eggs than cybercitizens.. is that normal?


[03/10/2023 1:19 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
i just picked up 2


[03/10/2023 1:19 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
no eggs big sad


[03/10/2023 1:19 AM] CM Mongo#0000
think when we switched nodes for the sales processor we also swiched how the rewards were distributed, will most likely do a giveaway with remaining eggs though


[03/10/2023 1:19 AM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0000
so there's a possibility that no one gets egg 213?


[03/10/2023 1:20 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
ooof no eggs for me either


[03/10/2023 1:20 AM] CM Mongo#0000
oh no, pretty sure we plan to give the eggs out, we'll think of something for the ones that remain if ccs mint out


[03/10/2023 1:20 AM] CM Mongo#0000
or maybe just randomly drop them to people who minted lol


[03/10/2023 1:21 AM] CM Mongo#0000
someone got a body part


[03/10/2023 1:21 AM] CM Mongo#0000

[03/10/2023 1:23 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
well wonder if egg 213 will even be minted.... dang


[03/10/2023 1:23 AM] slapshottwelve#0000

[03/10/2023 1:33 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000

The website says 29 NFTs remaining.
but I get Error minting coins: [object Object]


[03/10/2023 1:37 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Could you try to disconnect nautilus from the site, by going into connected dapps and removing cybercitizens.io and then reconenct?


[03/10/2023 1:38 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Tried for one more nd its working for me


[03/10/2023 1:38 AM] CM Mongo#0000
if that doesn't work you can always send 20 erg to the address manually from nautilus

but hmm


[03/10/2023 1:42 AM] CM Mongo#0000
weird it works for others but you, it could be a wallet issue , did you try disconnecing nautilus and reconnecting? you can select a different address in the nautilus app too , like switch addresses

[03/10/2023 2:05 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000
And have them battle


[03/10/2023 2:05 AM] CM Mongo#0000

Got to keep them entertained somehow


[03/10/2023 2:07 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Since they can't sling drinks for me RN


[03/10/2023 2:07 AM] CM Mongo#0000
They’ll be grinding your cypx for you soon enough 😄


[03/10/2023 2:08 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000

[03/10/2023 2:10 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Yeah I was surprised , I had to go and fix the counter cause they were being bought so fast it was messing it up lol


[03/10/2023 2:10 AM] 3rdstryker#0000
50 eggs left but only 25 left?


[03/10/2023 2:11 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Yeah seems they won’t all be given out but we’ll most likely do a giveaway with what’s left or something along those lines


[03/10/2023 2:11 AM] Sisyphuspush#0000
IMHO, this has been the most impressive mint since I've been around.  You all have done a great job getting this far and am excited for what the future holds for this project and team.


[03/10/2023 2:11 AM] 3rdstryker#0000
oh nice\\


[03/10/2023 2:12 AM] CM Mongo#0000

[03/10/2023 2:13 AM] CM Mongo#0000

[03/10/2023 2:54 AM] CM Mongo#0000
aww


[03/10/2023 2:55 AM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0000
can I hold my eggs in a separate wallet?


[03/10/2023 2:55 AM] CM Mongo#0000
hmm well for ingame youll most likely need what you want to play with all in one wallet but the eggs arent usable ingame yet


[03/10/2023 2:56 AM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0000
ok, because the wallet my not work properly with so many NFTs...


[03/10/2023 2:58 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Yeah, maybe sending the NFT's and eggs you want to play with to one wallet, and keeping the others on a separate , that way youll have one wallet just for the game and can send any nfts there if you want to play with them in the game

This is quite the paper!

It gave 25 AI agents motivations & memory, and put them in a simulated town.

Hello guys, how are you ? May I ask if The CyberEgg NFTs are verified  on skyharbour?


[04/13/2023 1:49 PM] Sova ❤ 🐝 Proxies#0000
they aren't the part of the collection : CyberVerse Tradable Items ? The new CyberEggs I mean


[04/13/2023 2:17 PM] 3rdstryker#0000
The new eggs will be added soon i believe


[04/13/2023 3:01 PM] Kilver#0000
The new eggs will be added soon to the Tradable Items collection. 😁

[04/13/2023 4:40 PM] Kilver#0000
As much as I would love to grill him, any attention to Ergo is good attention so I’ll let it slide.

all he cares about are clicks, once you look at his responses with that in mind it helps a little.


[04/13/2023 4:49 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Why does ku coin need so many confirmations now :(, I miss my 10 min erg deposits


[04/13/2023 4:49 PM] Kilver#0000
Oh yeah of course that is obvious and honestly it doesn’t bother me if he wants to chase profits but why start slamming Ergo for no reason just because the price has stagnated? Burning bridges for no reason.


[04/13/2023 4:49 PM] Kilver#0000
That’s why I use CoinEx


[04/13/2023 4:50 PM] Kilver#0000
In 2-3 mins I have my USTD in and my Ergo out.


[04/13/2023 4:50 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Oooo, may look into that , ku coin requires only 10 before the whole emission change


[04/13/2023 4:50 PM] CM Mongo#0000
30 now lol


[04/13/2023 4:51 PM] Kilver#0000
Yeah Ku Coin requires too much. I was not comfortable with the amount of IDs and stuff that they needed.


[04/13/2023 4:52 PM] CM Mongo#0000
I don’t think coinex is available where i live


[04/13/2023 4:52 PM] Kilver#0000
My usual route is bank -> crypto.com -> CoinEx -> Ergo wallet


[04/13/2023 4:52 PM] CM Mongo#0000
i mean ku coin is also banned in my province but my account still works LOL


[04/13/2023 4:53 PM] CM Mongo#0000
I hate crypto.com, so many fees


[04/13/2023 4:53 PM] CM Mongo#0000
And spread


[04/13/2023 4:53 PM] Kilver#0000
I do too but that’s why I only use it to buy and sell stablecoins/fiat


[04/13/2023 4:54 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Yeah


[04/13/2023 4:54 PM] Kilver#0000
I don’t exchange any other coins on crypto.com


[04/13/2023 4:54 PM] CM Mongo#0000
good call lol


[04/13/2023 4:55 PM] Kilver#0000
Unless they list Ergo they will be my link to my fiat money


[04/13/2023 4:55 PM] CM Mongo#0000
once I swapped like 2600 usdt into eth and it gave me 2430 eth , after that I never went back


[04/13/2023 4:55 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Like 2430 worth of eth lol


[04/13/2023 4:56 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Unless I absolutely need too


[04/13/2023 4:57 PM] Kilver#0000
I agree, they have horrible spreads. You need to go on Crypto.com Exchange (That I think is not available in the US) and manually set buy and sell limits to get filled exactly where you want.


[04/13/2023 4:57 PM] Kilver#0000
If you select buy at market price they burn you very badly


[04/13/2023 5:00 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Yeah , the spread is abysmal lol

I guess I didn’t have my coffee yet. Also making a list with the number of tracks that got minted takes a bit of time and a bit of greasing @CM Mongo or @Mr.Pixel to be bothered right now to go and check those numbers.

The countdown is for 19:00 UTC


[04/15/2023 1:31 PM] lexymon#0000
So exciiiiiiting


[04/15/2023 1:34 PM] 3rdstryker#0000
no countdown for me lol


[04/15/2023 1:40 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
if you don't see the countdown, don't use it yet, please. 

Mongo had to make a mistake setting up the countdown for different timezone it seems.


[04/15/2023 1:43 PM] 3rdstryker#0000
i thought so lol


[04/15/2023 4:39 PM] ErGonario#0000
hi everyone! what's wrong on skyharbor? i'm trying to buy a citizen and can't do it


[04/15/2023 4:39 PM] ErGonario#0000
I sign the transaction but nothing happens


[04/15/2023 4:40 PM] Kilver#0000
Are you using Nautilus wallet?


[04/15/2023 4:40 PM] ErGonario#0000
yeah


[04/15/2023 4:40 PM] Kilver#0000
How many NFTs do you have in your wallet? Is it many?


[04/15/2023 4:41 PM] Kilver#0000
Might be a Tx box issue.


[04/15/2023 4:41 PM] ErGonario#0000
well a few maybe 15 or so


[04/15/2023 4:41 PM] Kilver#0000
That’s ok… hmmm…


[04/15/2023 4:41 PM] Kilver#0000
@Mr.Pixel @CM Mongo do you have an idea?


[04/15/2023 4:42 PM] Kilver#0000
@quokka


[04/15/2023 4:42 PM] ErGonario#0000
i'll try consolidating


[04/15/2023 4:43 PM] Kilver#0000
Try but 15 NFTs should not really be an issue.


[04/15/2023 4:44 PM] Kilver#0000
I @ some people with more brain power than me so maybe they can help.


[04/15/2023 4:45 PM] ErGonario#0000
thank's a lot!


[04/15/2023 4:57 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Hey! No idea. I bought an NFT yesterday and everything worked fine. 
I definitely recommend you to talk to Quokka who is founder of skyharbor.


[04/15/2023 5:12 PM] ErGonario#0000
(re  : *<Mr.Pixel> Hey! No idea. I bought an NFT yeste...*)

Having issues loading my own wallet on skyharbor. Not sure if related.


[04/15/2023 7:51 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Hatching event will be live in a few hours. We will be doing an announcement once it's live + short tutorial clip. 🦾


[04/15/2023 8:07 PM] Kilver#0000
I guess I’ll hatch some tomorrow on stream.


[04/15/2023 9:29 PM] slapshottwelve#0000

Share it with us!


[04/15/2023 9:37 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Already sent prizes for all the past days since the cyberegg minting event started, except the first one. I realized I picked one of our addresses, so I will raffle the Apartment prize to someone else who minted at least 1 cyberegg 10th May.

I see. Little brown pp too. Congrats!


[04/15/2023 9:46 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Also, to keep you updated and transparent, the reason we didn't announce the hatching event is because Mongo needs to fix one more thing for the hatching page that I noticed today... but he went to his cousin's bachelor party yesterday and he hasn't got back to me since then 😭 😂 
Other than that, everything should be ready.


[04/15/2023 9:46 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
you gotta train that luck


[04/15/2023 9:47 PM] lexymon#0000

How early am I?


[04/16/2023 9:50 AM] 3rdstryker#0000
for the hatching of the eggs?


[04/16/2023 9:53 AM] Kilver#0000
From as scale of early to late, 1 representing extremely early and 100 late. I would say 60.


[04/16/2023 9:53 AM] Kilver#0000
But that’s just an opinion, I’m not part of the team.


[04/16/2023 9:56 AM] briangunner#0000
👍🏻


[04/16/2023 10:05 AM] lexymon#0000
the game is in beta... thats the defintion of early haha

CYPX?


[04/16/2023 10:08 AM] 3rdstryker#0000
best thing to do is buy some citizens off skyharbor, get some cypx off https://app.spectrum.fi/, and mint some eggs

hey! Game with multiple working features, cyberegg nft minting, hatching event for the  first #1 - #300 eggs.. 🦾


[04/16/2023 11:08 AM] Kilver#0000
It costs 250 CYPX to hatch an egg?


[04/16/2023 11:08 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
yes, CyberEgg + 250 cypx


[04/16/2023 11:09 AM] Kilver#0000
Good thing I’ve been collecting my daily rewards.


[04/16/2023 11:09 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
You guys wanted more utility for cypx tokens, so we added a small "fee" for the hatching.


[04/16/2023 11:10 AM] lexymon#0000
i think its a good idea


[04/16/2023 11:13 AM] lexymon#0000
i wonder how hatching is handled in the tax report 😂  technically its a swap. but thats ridiculous. i will just ignore it


[04/16/2023 11:15 AM] slapshottwelve#0000

a baby yeti


[04/16/2023 11:21 AM] Kilver#0000

[04/16/2023 11:22 AM] lexymon#0000
so my diamond egg turned into a pet with golden and silver robotic parts... i guess its me being unlucky again?

Jk. Really cute all of them.


[04/16/2023 11:26 AM] lexymon#0000
so i got a yeti and a penguin. all ice themed


[04/16/2023 11:27 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
The eggs Color doesn’t effect the body parts of the pets, only the animals.  Each egg has different animals that can be hatched from


[04/16/2023 11:27 AM] lexymon#0000
ah i see


[04/16/2023 11:28 AM] lexymon#0000
so a green egg will give you a mouse and a rabbit and a cyberium one a dragon i assume


[04/16/2023 11:28 AM] lexymon#0000
for example


[04/16/2023 11:28 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I don’t want to leak the pet list so people have fun seeing what they get


[04/16/2023 11:28 AM] Kilver#0000
I agree!


[04/16/2023 11:28 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Basically yes


[04/16/2023 11:28 AM] Kilver#0000
Let us have fun finding most of them first


[04/16/2023 11:28 AM] lexymon#0000
so next question! evolve wen and how


[04/16/2023 11:29 AM] lexymon#0000
😂


[04/16/2023 11:29 AM] Kilver#0000
Pfff. Feeding them exp candy of course


[04/16/2023 11:29 AM] lexymon#0000
omg a new struggle... because i assume the baby pengun is much cuter than the stage 3 version. but the yeti i will defintely level up. he looks weird


[04/16/2023 11:30 AM] Kilver#0000
That’s why you need multiple eggs. To complete your live pokedex


[04/16/2023 11:30 AM] lexymon#0000
what i need and what i can afford are two totally different things, unfortunately


[04/16/2023 11:31 AM] lexymon#0000
i could hatch the golden egg i have tho


[04/16/2023 11:31 AM] Kilver#0000
@Mr.Pixel in that video you waited like 5 minutes for it to hatch. Is it how long it actually takes?


[04/16/2023 11:32 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
It depends on tx pending time


[04/16/2023 11:34 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
After you send funds, you have to wait till your tx is confirmed and then our sale processor sends the pet and the site shows what you are getting once you have a receiving tx pending of the pet


[04/16/2023 11:34 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
i think i glitched it.  i sent a third egg but it displayed the same animal from my second hatch

Funds = egg + cypx


[04/16/2023 11:36 AM] Kilver#0000
I think I need around 12.500 CYPX to hatch all my eggs. 🥲


[04/16/2023 11:36 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
It’s maybe because you are sending more transactions at the same time


[04/16/2023 11:37 AM] lexymon#0000
i also had two parallel tx and it worked


[04/16/2023 11:37 AM] lexymon#0000
baby yeti and baby penguin were born in the same block


[04/16/2023 11:39 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
yea i sent another bc i thought the one that popped up was new but it was an old one


[04/16/2023 11:39 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
twins!


[04/16/2023 11:40 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
the penguins are cute af


[04/16/2023 11:42 AM] lexymon#0000

[04/16/2023 11:42 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000

[04/16/2023 11:48 AM] 3rdstryker#0000
how do we know how rare it is?


[04/16/2023 11:50 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
rarity is same as egg.  more body parts more rare


[04/16/2023 11:51 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
waited for all tranactions to confirm before sending anymore and it sent me the first pet i hatched


[04/16/2023 11:53 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000

[04/16/2023 11:53 AM] lexymon#0000
what happens if we send a #300+ egg to the hatching address? there's no measure preventing it


[04/16/2023 11:53 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
We will refund it.


[04/16/2023 11:54 AM] lexymon#0000

[04/16/2023 12:00 PM] 3rdstryker#0000
is there like a ranking, same as cybercitizens?


[04/16/2023 12:02 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
There will be. Not yet.


[04/16/2023 12:02 PM] 3rdstryker#0000
Gotcha!


[04/16/2023 12:06 PM] lexymon#0000

📢Hello fellow ergonauts, I have a very interesting offer for you. A few days ago, the Czech exchange Coinmate contacted me via email asking what other coins I would like to see at this exchange, and I immediately thought of #Ergo.
Twitter


[04/16/2023 12:09 PM] 3rdstryker#0000
eggs that i got from the latest mint are up there too...


[04/16/2023 12:10 PM] Kilver#0000
Only 1-300 will hatch

I mean how the got it at first?


[04/16/2023 12:19 PM] Kilver#0000
They were minted long ago.


[04/16/2023 12:19 PM] Kilver#0000
A second mint is planned for in the future.


[04/16/2023 12:19 PM] Caliburn#0000
I see thank you


[04/16/2023 12:20 PM] Caliburn#0000
is there any guide how many you can get from staking?


[04/16/2023 12:20 PM] Caliburn#0000
i did see i need to lvl up to get more token?


[04/16/2023 12:22 PM] Kilver#0000
So talking about citizens. They will give you different amounts depending on the rarity. And that amount increases in % with the citizen lvling up.


[04/16/2023 12:24 PM] Caliburn#0000
to check the rarity is on the web?


[04/16/2023 12:24 PM] ERGOGO#0000
Hey guys, I want to sell my cyber egg over on HS, but i suppose that the mint address is not verified, and my egg cannot get listed under cyberverse tradable items. Only the 0-300 CyberEggs are listed?


[04/16/2023 12:25 PM] 3rdStryker#0000
thats it


[04/16/2023 12:25 PM] Caliburn#0000
tried to buy CYPX but cant .. Transaction rejected idk why


[04/16/2023 12:25 PM] Kilver#0000
Go on #🔍┃cybercitizens and type !cc followed by the citizens number


[04/16/2023 12:26 PM] Kilver#0000
I don’t know why that might happened


[04/16/2023 12:28 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Unfortunately, for now yes. However we already ask quokka to add another minting address to our page, but he hasn’t got back to me since then.


[04/16/2023 12:28 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
From spectrum?


[04/16/2023 12:52 PM] lexymon#0000
i think someting is broken


[04/16/2023 12:52 PM] lexymon#0000
12 confirmations now and didnt get a pet yet 🤔


[04/16/2023 12:55 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
yah, we are investigating cyberegg #100 nft, is that yours?


[04/16/2023 12:55 PM] lexymon#0000
yup


[04/16/2023 1:19 PM] Kilver#0000
Shouldn’t we do 1x tx at the time?xD


[04/16/2023 1:22 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
you can do more txs at the time, but pets may not all appear hatched on the page (only in your wallet)


[04/16/2023 1:24 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
solved. @lexymon


[04/16/2023 1:24 PM] lexymon#0000
i hope my #100 comes back with 4 diamond gears

Looks like hood Simba!


[04/16/2023 2:13 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
No one else hatching?!? I guess we have to wait for kilver to hatch the other 275 eggs


[04/16/2023 2:14 PM] Kilver#0000
XD


[04/16/2023 2:14 PM] Zacharie#0000
Will hatch some later, had guests at home


[04/16/2023 2:15 PM] Kilver#0000
I have like 45-50. So it will take me a while if I have to wait for the confirmation.


[04/16/2023 2:16 PM] Kilver#0000
I sent the eggs to my main cyberverse   wallet. I always sweat when I put all my eggs in one TX basket.

Better build a script for it… otherwise you’re gonna stream 2 days

xD


[04/16/2023 2:17 PM] Kilver#0000
Hey more content. I can do like 10 eggs a stream. XD


[04/16/2023 2:24 PM] Kilver#0000
@UpwindStrategy - King de Medici needs to stream his eggs hatching! I’m sure he has a few.


[04/16/2023 2:29 PM] Kilver#0000
Damn, BAYC passed 1mil ETH trading volume on OS. Crazy.


[04/16/2023 2:30 PM] Kilver#0000
That’s like 2 Billion $.


[04/16/2023 2:31 PM] 3rdstryker#0000
I am hatching little by little


[04/16/2023 2:38 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
For whatever reason I never got lucky with eggs during mint even though they were the best odds at getting! So I already hatched the 7 I got! Highest rarity only legendary

Hey i have something for you 😄


[04/16/2023 3:00 PM] Kilver#0000
Does he need to close his eyes first? I don’t think he’s falling for that one.


[04/16/2023 3:49 PM] lexymon#0000
hey who delisted the two green eggs i wanted to buy T_T


[04/16/2023 3:51 PM] Kilver#0000
A smart cookie that’s who!


[04/16/2023 4:34 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
wait did the level exp change?  I thought it was just 1k for each level? now its last level + 1k exp?


[04/16/2023 4:35 PM] Kilver#0000
Nop that’s what I thought as well.


[04/16/2023 4:35 PM] Kilver#0000
lvl 2 is 2k, lvl 3 is 3k etc


[04/16/2023 4:37 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
okay cool i actually like that anyway lol


[04/16/2023 4:38 PM] Kilver#0000
Good luck getting to lvl 10 or 100 xD


[04/16/2023 4:38 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
yea it makes it crazy difficult lol


[04/16/2023 4:38 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
hopefully the rewards adjust accordingly


[04/16/2023 4:39 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
for some reason i thought after level 1 it started me at 1000/2000 and level 2 started at 2000/3000 already


[04/16/2023 4:39 PM] Zacharie#0000
The higher the level the higher the potential job lvl aswell so more xp


[04/16/2023 4:40 PM] Kilver#0000
That is true.


[04/16/2023 4:40 PM] Zacharie#0000
But yeah I feel like playing WoW years ago, which is nice. blood and sweat


[04/16/2023 4:42 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I think leveling citizens will be more fun and little bit easier once we add a little bit more features (stats, crafting, inventory, mining, exploring and more minigames)


[04/16/2023 4:43 PM] Kilver#0000
Yes! Straight in my veins!


[04/16/2023 4:43 PM] Zacharie#0000
I sent some eggs to hatch ~40min ago and still no ~~pokemon~~ cyberpets 😦


[04/16/2023 4:43 PM] Kilver#0000
Next VR support and I’m living in the cyberverse full time!


[04/16/2023 4:44 PM] Kilver#0000
Were they 1-300# eggs?


[04/16/2023 4:45 PM] Zacharie#0000
80, 192, 234, 244


[04/16/2023 4:46 PM] Kilver#0000
Hmm. Weird.


[04/16/2023 4:46 PM] Kilver#0000
I’m sure Pixel will have a look


[04/16/2023 4:46 PM] Zacharie#0000

[04/16/2023 5:26 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I think you are using page /eggpage instead of this one https://cybercitizens.io/testeggpage/ ?

the old one we announced last week is buggy and we can't remove it till @CM Mongo  comes back.
 The old page will be removed and the current will be improved a bit tomorrow so people won't see #300+ cybereggs


[04/16/2023 5:34 PM] Zacharie#0000
makes sense


[04/16/2023 5:34 PM] aradaiel#0000
Is there a spot you can view them?


[04/16/2023 5:34 PM] aradaiel#0000

[04/16/2023 5:35 PM] aradaiel#0000
Whitium egg is incubating. 🙈


[04/16/2023 5:35 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
we didn't leak any of them, so people can have fun hatching them 😁


[04/16/2023 5:35 PM] aradaiel#0000

[04/16/2023 5:36 PM] aradaiel#0000
Is there a .cc command to check rarity yet?


[04/16/2023 5:36 PM] aradaiel#0000
I didn't even know what a quokka was until I hatched it, haha


[04/16/2023 5:37 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
.cc command?


[04/16/2023 5:46 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
time to hatch my eggs.


[04/16/2023 5:48 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
make sure you are sending only eggs #1-#300


[04/16/2023 5:49 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
I accidentally sent 2486


[04/16/2023 5:49 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
lmaooooo


[04/16/2023 5:49 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
will be refunded


[04/16/2023 5:49 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Thank you. All of the others were 1-300


[04/16/2023 5:49 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
i have cyberegg 0


[04/16/2023 5:49 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
i might save it idk


[04/16/2023 5:50 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

there are some weirder pets, but im not gonna spoil you anything 😂


[04/16/2023 6:02 PM] aradaiel#0000
Curious to see what these turn into when leveled up


[04/16/2023 6:02 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
yeti is one of them


[04/16/2023 6:02 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Is the rarity just based off of the egg or is the bear actually rare?


[04/16/2023 6:02 PM] lexymon#0000
It’s the egg rarity


[04/16/2023 6:03 PM] lexymon#0000
Yeti is the only one which I think isn’t cute.. I’m looking forward to evolve it 😂

[04/16/2023 6:04 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
There are over 70 pets and each egg has different chances of pets that can drop from them.


[04/16/2023 6:06 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
if the properties of files don't lie, we have 1500 images/layers for this collection

[04/16/2023 6:19 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
CyberEggs and CyberPets holders will vote for the first Pets utility, and one of the ideas that holders will be able to vote for is fights.


[04/16/2023 6:28 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000

Minted an egg with 'epic' rarity.. I don't see that on the site, is this good or bad?


[04/16/2023 7:38 PM] lexymon#0000
5-10 mins normally


[04/16/2023 7:39 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
can you dm me ?


[04/16/2023 7:40 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Thanks for refunding my egg so fast


[04/16/2023 7:48 PM] ProtoSuckaPunk#0000
@Mr.Pixel yes, done


[04/16/2023 8:59 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

[04/16/2023 9:11 PM] Kilver#0000
I have 2 more masterwork eggs to hatch tomorrow. If it’s not a hydra I will be upset. XD


[04/16/2023 9:13 PM] Kilver#0000
I really like that common pink cat it looks very derpy. ❤️


[04/16/2023 9:52 PM] lexymon#0000
Tbh I find almost everything I saw so far quite cool. When the goal was to let the stage 1 pets look super cute, it’s a big success


[04/16/2023 9:52 PM] Kilver#0000
Except the sphinx.


[04/16/2023 9:53 PM] dumbgenx#0000
Just realized that some Cyberian NFTs are Unverified on Skyharbor, including two cybereggs that I have (above #300), Laser Guns and Into Cyberia


[04/16/2023 9:54 PM] Kilver#0000
Yes eggs above #300 will be added soon


[04/16/2023 9:54 PM] lexymon#0000
I hope the stage 1 sprites that suck will be badass in stage 3. Quite difficult to pixel a cute sphinx or other mythical creatures 😂


[04/16/2023 9:55 PM] Kilver#0000
I don’t think the sphinx ever was a baby so yeah.


[04/16/2023 9:55 PM] lexymon#0000
I also don’t like my yeti and my centaur in stage 1 sooo much but I’m optimistic


[04/16/2023 9:56 PM] Kilver#0000
They will look cool in later stages I’m sure.


[04/16/2023 9:56 PM] lexymon#0000
Also I don’t like golden Body parts but ya, fuck my luck today


[04/16/2023 10:01 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
we really appreciate the feedback ❤️


[04/17/2023 12:54 AM] engchitchat#0000
I sent my egg to the address without the 250 CYPX. Can I do that in a separate transaction? Sorry 😦


[04/17/2023 1:20 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Hi I havent received my pet from a few hours ago. Are you guys still working on the processor?

[04/17/2023 2:55 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Our node got stuck, thank you for waiting till we resumed the node.

The cybereggs #102, #44 & #196 were sent back to the owners. 

CyberEgg #13 was hatched into CyberPet #13.


[04/17/2023 2:55 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
You can.


[04/17/2023 3:03 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
For  Hatching With Nautilus Use this page: https://cybercitizens.io/testeggpage/ or send CyberEgg (#1 - #300) + 250 CYPX to this address: 9hGSejCfjTcwiKCAPPMMDhvCgFF33VJvmSdMAALHuSxFJkE5u88

1 extra energy at some point


[04/17/2023 10:33 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
any suggestions for lvl benefits > #💡┃ideas , we have 100 lvl, so we have a lot of free space to add what you suggest

[04/17/2023 10:33 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
my idea is to allow people to gain stamina/energy once stats are added


[04/17/2023 10:34 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
the higher lvl of stamina cybercitizen has, the higher the stamina will be.


[04/17/2023 10:34 PM] lexymon#0000

What do you think about the 7Seas exchange? Have you tried it yet?


[04/17/2023 10:38 PM] Kilver#0000
I have not yet.


[04/17/2023 10:40 PM] theta_decay#0000
Yup, been playing around with it all day. Pretty smooth.


[04/17/2023 10:41 PM] lexymon#0000
I don’t need KYC free exchanges so I won’t use it. They seem to be good guys but you never know


[04/17/2023 10:42 PM] lexymon#0000
It’s cool that they listed ergo native tokens tho


[04/17/2023 10:42 PM] lexymon#0000
Might help us finally getting on cmc and coingecko


[04/17/2023 11:09 PM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0000
For that 7seas would already be needed to be itself listed by cmc and coingecko.. maybe they are not because they are very young still..

[04/18/2023 2:05 PM] lexymon#0000
i was referring to the fact that as long as its an egg it always unhatched haha


[04/18/2023 2:06 PM] stro#0000

[04/18/2023 2:06 PM] stro#0000

Do daily rewards stack each day? Or do you have to claim from the bank each day?


[04/19/2023 5:02 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
each day sadly.


[04/19/2023 5:02 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000

[04/19/2023 5:22 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
@Mr.Pixel I saw that the egg event ends may 9, what happens to the rest of the eggs?


[04/19/2023 6:01 AM] Dilly Dallier#0000
Do the rewards from minigames get sent out automatically each day?

Only eggs 1-300# are listed at the moment. The rest are being added soon.

we are waiting for skyharbor to list the minting address of the nfts

we plan to switch them with some eggs


[04/19/2023 2:14 PM] BOUNCE#0000
When would they be added cause my egg is #1k+


[04/19/2023 2:16 PM] Kilver#0000
Apparently there are like 2 songs left in there


[04/19/2023 2:17 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I asked them about it 8 days ago. We can't really do much about it, it's up to them when they list new collections or edit existing pages...


[04/19/2023 2:18 PM] BOUNCE#0000
Ohhh alrt thanks


[04/19/2023 2:21 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
We are resyncing the node that was used for distributing rewards.  All the rewards that haven't been received (from daily rewards, jobs, daily spins) will be sent once the node is synced again. @Breehze told me it should be tonight. I will announce it, once it's synced. 


Same with #pets-discussion & #ergopixels-proposal. I've been a bit busy with other things, so I haven't posted anything about pets and ergopixels yet.


[04/19/2023 3:42 PM] BOUNCE#0000

[04/19/2023 3:43 PM] BOUNCE#0000
if it is moved to a verifed collection will my sale be canceled

No, it's fine. You can do whatever you want with the egg. 

We raffle address from the tx history on the wallet.

Who won the minting raffle today?! Looks like it went to an empty wallet 🤔

not sure what you mean by empty. The wallet that won has tokens & NFTs


[04/21/2023 9:22 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
Hmm idk this was the only outgoing transaction yesterday so I assumed it was the reward going out

[04/21/2023 9:24 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
It is tough to keep track of rewards. Have to scroll through transactions to see if you won something or not. Maybe a rewards page that list the address for raffles, leaderboards etc?

Hey, how’s it going !


[04/23/2023 6:02 AM] Justin_VIP | Suiswap#0000
I have a problem getting ERG tokens to pay the fees 😅


[04/23/2023 6:03 AM] Justin_VIP | Suiswap#0000
I already went to faucet but they gave me very little


[04/23/2023 6:04 AM] CM Mongo#0000
what was your address I can send you a tiny bit


[04/23/2023 6:04 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Can dm me if you want


[04/23/2023 6:04 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Just tell me when you doc


[04/23/2023 6:04 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Do


[04/23/2023 6:05 AM] Justin_VIP | Suiswap#0000
Thank you 🥲


[04/23/2023 7:21 AM] Justin_VIP | Suiswap#0000
Excuse me, could you give me advice on how to get ERG to buy Citizens?


[04/23/2023 7:44 AM] Kilver#0000
KuCoin or CoinEx have USDT/ERG pairs.


[04/23/2023 7:47 AM] Justin_VIP | Suiswap#0000
I'm a bit confused, the ERG token is not a proof token?


[04/23/2023 7:56 AM] Kilver#0000
Erg is not a token


[04/23/2023 7:57 AM] Kilver#0000
Erg is a PoW coin.


[04/23/2023 8:06 AM] Justin_VIP | Suiswap#0000
I understand, I thought that this was a test coin and that to get it I only had to request it in the faucet 😅


[04/23/2023 8:08 AM] Justin_VIP | Suiswap#0000
So to complete zealy's tasks I have to buy coins in the market, sorry for the confusion hehe


[04/23/2023 8:14 AM] Kilver#0000
What task asks you to buy coins?


[04/23/2023 8:32 AM] 3rdstryker#0000
buy apartments and stuff i guess lol


[04/23/2023 8:33 AM] Kilver#0000
I guess that’s fair.


[04/23/2023 8:34 AM] Justin_VIP | Suiswap#0000
It doesn't ask for it directly, I mean it asks you to play Cyberverse and to play you need to buy an NFT


[04/23/2023 8:35 AM] Justin_VIP | Suiswap#0000
Correct me if I'm wrong


[04/23/2023 8:35 AM] Kilver#0000
Nop, you’re right.

What is the % to loose at the free daily spin ?

I’m sure @Mr.Pixel can answer that. But from what I remember 70% I think.

I minted 5 eggs this morning, fingers crossed :3


[04/25/2023 10:25 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

[04/25/2023 11:28 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
guess im not minting today! bad chance 😂


[04/25/2023 11:29 PM] Kilver#0000
You never know. I did my mint today still.


[04/25/2023 11:30 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
I also have been minting commons consistently so even worse luck lol


[04/25/2023 11:30 PM] Kilver#0000
Every egg is valuable.

Yea good point!


[04/25/2023 11:36 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
I do like the common pets.  More of a homey pet anyway!


[04/25/2023 11:36 PM] slapshottwelve#0000
Idk how my citizens are going to look after a hydra


[04/25/2023 11:37 PM] Kilver#0000
I’m yet to get a hydra. 😤


[04/25/2023 11:39 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
All unminted eggs will be burned which is 🔥


[04/25/2023 11:41 PM] Kilver#0000
Kinda makes me a bit sad. A lot of cool pets will never see the light of day…


[04/26/2023 12:32 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Just think of instead of them being burned , they’re all being sent to a farm to hatch and live off their days 😂


[04/26/2023 12:54 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Makes me happy. Scarcity 🙂

10... might go hard with my last 5 idk yet. I'm pretty content with 10 for now


[04/26/2023 11:09 AM] Kilver#0000
I’m still targeting to have 25 but my work schedule has been very hectic. Hard to find even 30 mins to play.


[04/26/2023 11:10 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
Thats insane! But once you're there those free spins 🤑


[04/26/2023 11:11 AM] Kilver#0000
I know. I’m 16/25 atm


[04/26/2023 11:11 AM] slapshottwelve#0000
Im expecting some more updates for higher levels so gotta keep my core group going


[04/26/2023 11:12 AM] Kilver#0000
I will do the same after those 25. I will try to get some to lvl 2 and 3 in case cool stuff is coming.


[04/26/2023 11:15 AM] Kilver#0000
I also just noticed that I won an apartment from the EGG mint raffle. Nice!

Yes.

We have a token allocation for that.

We'll let you know in a few hours. Mongo is the one who takes care of the crew3 tasks.  Apparently he's still asleep 😁

[04/28/2023 5:25 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I would actually like to know the reason for the rebrand. CREW3 was much more attractive imo


[04/28/2023 5:26 PM] lexymon#0000
I think so too


[04/28/2023 5:28 PM] lexymon#0000
they had a cute logo and a nice name which was perfect for the platform they are... and now just a generic internet startup name + logo

Not bad. Having a day off, resting. You?


[04/29/2023 11:47 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
currently finishing traits for new female sprites, so breehze can generate them later, so busy... 😁


[04/29/2023 11:51 AM] Kilver#0000
What for? 🤔


[04/29/2023 11:51 AM] Kilver#0000

[04/29/2023 11:54 AM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Very fun Saturday 🦾


[04/29/2023 11:55 AM] Kilver#0000
Can’t wait to hatch some of the new eggs!


[04/29/2023 11:56 AM] Kilver#0000
It will be done in-game this time?


[04/29/2023 12:00 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Still on the site. 

But this might be the last drop + hatching event that is hosted outside of the game. 

We really want to host everything in the game in the future.


[04/29/2023 12:05 PM] Kilver#0000
Do you guy think it was a bad decision to mint all the eggs at the same time instead of waves like the cc?


[04/29/2023 12:12 PM] 3rdstryker#0000
CYPX activity dire on seven seas


[04/29/2023 12:13 PM] Kilver#0000
I mean I’m not selling any CYPX at these prices. XD Either hoarding or using.


[04/29/2023 12:21 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
I don't think so. 

We wanted to do 1 month minting event to celebrate Easter, increase eggs/pets NFT amount a bit, as we mentioned in the whitepaper that we plan to do it, collect funds so we can afford building more features (not just those that are in the whitepaper) and BURN unsold ones. 

We don't expect to sell them all, but we minted 3000 anyway thinking there might be a bigger interest since we created a lot of traits and pets and have an upcoming utility for the collection that will be voted by the holders of the cybereggs/pets very soon.


[04/29/2023 12:21 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
give it a time


[04/29/2023 12:23 PM] 3rdstryker#0000
do we have people working full time on the game?


[04/29/2023 12:23 PM] Kilver#0000
Yeah I know…


[04/29/2023 12:32 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
No. We don't have enough funds to hire a full time game developers. 

While Hero is busy with other work, I'm planning next updates and preparing game assets + paying 2 more artist to do icons, buildings, interiors etc.. so he can work on next update when he's available. 

I would say I'm the only one "full-time", but I'm not getting any funds, all the money are spent on the game development, site or other small features we add/create.


[04/29/2023 12:51 PM] 3rdstryker#0000
work outside of crypto?


[04/29/2023 12:57 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Note, this doesn't mean we don't have funds. I would say that we have funds to build SLOWER as we don't have a full time dev. - I'm also trying to be very careful with project's funds. 

That's the reason why we are doing NFT drops actively, but some people call it cash grab, meanwhile we're trying our best to collect funds to deliver more features in a faster timeline.


[04/29/2023 12:57 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
Correct


[04/29/2023 1:00 PM] 3rdstryker#0000
I appreciate your hard work


[04/29/2023 6:17 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Honestly, im willing to mint things in the future simply just to support your development. If we all mint a few, it adds up 🙂


[04/29/2023 6:23 PM] Kilver#0000
Soon CYPX will have a lot of utility and people will have to start buying in top of earning.


[04/29/2023 7:58 PM] flanecz#0000
Can we hatch number 300+ eggs?


[04/29/2023 7:58 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Very soon 😉


[04/29/2023 7:59 PM] CM Mongo#0000
Will make an announcement when it’ll be open 🙂


[04/29/2023 8:23 PM] qx()#0000
Sooooooon :) looking forward to some more pets! My few under 300 are lonely. :)


[04/29/2023 10:18 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000
**🚨 Hatching CyberEggs to CyberPets Event is now live!**

💻 Use Page For Hatching With Nautilus: https://cybercitizens.io/eggpage/ or send manually CyberEgg (#0 - #3000) + 250 CYPX to this address: 9hGSejCfjTcwiKCAPPMMDhvCgFF33VJvmSdMAALHuSxFJkE5u88   

❗️ Note, if you are hatching through the website, you need to wait till the receiving transaction of your CyberPet (after you send Egg + Cypx to hatch)  is confirmed on the ergo explorer to hatch another CyberEgg. This is only so you can see on our website what CyberPet you are getting from the CyberEgg. 
If you are in hurry, you can simply just spam the hatching, but it won't display you the correct pet on the site (only in the wallet).

🐶 Over 70 different pets, 8 backgrounds,  8 skins and body parts!

**🔧   Voting for the first future CyberPets utility will be announced in a few days.**

🦾Good luck with hatching!


[04/29/2023 10:19 PM] Mr.Pixel#0000

I always get a bit nervous when these super blocks happen.. but it was two 10minute blocks after each other and somehow the explorer didn’t update

I sent egg on address without 250 CYPX


[05/01/2023 2:12 AM] CM Mongo#0000
Should be returned although I’m not 100% on that @Mr.Pixel , if it’s not returned sure pixel will return it once he is up 🙂


[05/01/2023 2:13 AM] Ninjah#0000
Can I send 250 cpyx to the same address?


[05/01/2023 2:13 AM] CM Mongo#0000
