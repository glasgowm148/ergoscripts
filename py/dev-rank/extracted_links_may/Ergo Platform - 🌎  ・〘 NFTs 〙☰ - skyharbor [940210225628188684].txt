Hello @skyharbor project team! How is it going with your development, would you provide updates?


[02/11/2022 2:20 PM] quokka#1273
Yeah sure! We just got the putting an NFT up for sale smart contract done and working super easily with nautilus wallet. 

We are now working on retrieving the NFT‚Äôs and displaying them. This will probably get done in an hour or two and then we will work on implementing the buying function

We will implement a minting functionality in the future but it will most likely be a choice on the artist of if we can directly sell on sky harbor


[02/11/2022 3:20 PM] quokka#1273
For now we're focusing on the ability to buy and sell, we will be expanding on minting in the near future


[02/11/2022 4:37 PM] quokka#1273
Just got done displaying the NFT‚Äôs. Working on the buy functionality. Should be done soon. And then it‚Äôs cleaning up the UI and working on the database to make the website faster

I hope the first day is going well Quokka. Please share a few notes from today as we are coming closer to the end of the day. Best regards,


[02/11/2022 9:41 PM] quokka#1273
Hey root, we made some great progress today

Notes:
- Today we had a group call solidifying the best way to deal with blockchain data with db
- @Krasavice Blasen  finished the ERG sales contract and tested NFT buying and selling
- I implemented the buying UI and with help from krasavice, built the selling tx on frontend using nautilus wallet. Putting an nft for sale worked like a charm. 
- implemented displaying the for sale NFT‚Äôs. 

Getting the buy functionality to work currently. Once that is done it will pretty much be a fully functioning marketplace run by smart contracts. We want to make the site run at a tolerable pace so we are waiting until we implement our db to release. We will be working on that Saturday and Sunday with @HazeyOneKenobi

[02/14/2022 2:25 PM] quokka#1273
Here‚Äôs some info about our submission:

Sky Harbor NFT marketplace was built to allow ERGO NFT enthusiasts somewhere to trade and browse NFTs, and is intended to become a community hub where new entrants into the ENFT space can enjoy a welcoming and secure platform to begin their collecting! We also aim to give our existing ergo artists a space to increase their visibility and help bring lasting value to their projects.

Sky Harbor aims to help secure and improve the image of the ENFT space by restricting sales to only collections which are pre-approved by the site administrators, though in future we will be adding some form of unverified collections. We also plan to add lasting value to the ENFT space by tracking metrics on sales such as sales prices over time, volumes traded, etc. and making this data freely available via API for anyone to use.

[04/10/2022 7:54 PM] liquid_phase#4605
does skyharbor allow the minting of NFTs for artists which have been accepted to the platform or is it required to use a third party tool to mint


[04/20/2022 4:43 AM] liquid_phase#4605
Can anyone at sky harbor provide the standards by which projects are judged upon and vetted against? Or is it an insider secret that no one gets to know except the skyharbor team


[04/20/2022 4:43 AM] liquid_phase#4605
Follow up question: are all projects judged by the same standards, or does skyharbor play favorites to specific projects?


[04/20/2022 4:44 AM] liquid_phase#4605
Would love some transparency here if you are to become a big player in the space


[04/20/2022 4:49 AM] liquid_phase#4605
@Krasavice Blasen - the quokka in charge  told me he needs my project to have more volume or be better known by the community - can you tell him we worked together on Ergohack for nightOwl and that i've been active on discord both helping around and promoting my NFTs ? 

If he wants a specific volume traded or selling floor , i need to know that specific volume so i can set a goal.


[04/20/2022 8:44 AM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
We ask for original art that isn't offensive, stolen, etc. Surprised quokka mentioned volume, its too easily faked for me to be content with using it for listing approvals.

All projects are judged by the same standards - though those standards aren't just about metrics on volume, etc. It's also how a project goes about marketing / shilling, their approach to longevity in the space and not just making a quick buck, etc.

There's a lot that goes into it, but our priorities lie with building a great platform with amazing content, protecting buyers and helping artists.

[04/20/2022 11:19 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
You are certainly an active member of the community.
Also to add to what Hazey has already said; we take precautions to ensure collections listed on SkyHarbor consist of original work.
One such precaution is that verified collections do not consist of duplicate works from any chain.  
All verified collections need to satisfy this rule, which is why your collection application was rejected.
If you could burn/take down your listings on opensea then you would satisfy this rule.
Furthermore, whilst I trust the art is your own work - even if we allowed for duplicates cross-chain, since your Ergo collection is of a younger age you would still need to prove you are indeed the owner of your opensea collection and at that point you may as well take the listings off if you plan to appeal to Ergo only? 

The SkyHarbor review process is set up to be objective and thorough and we always welcome community scrutiny over the process, so that we can grow to become the big player you speak of üôÇ


[04/20/2022 2:34 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Great, i'll get my old computer back from the ex girlfriend and hopefully she hasnt formatted it so my firefox saved login to opensea is still there


[04/20/2022 2:35 PM] liquid_phase#4605
as mentioned to quokka, since these were lazy minted they dont exist inside a wallet and cant be burned


[04/20/2022 2:35 PM] liquid_phase#4605
the only way to get rid of them is to login to opensea and delete the collection, which again was taken down for sale last year and never put back up for sale (it's essentially just a photo gallery)


[04/20/2022 2:39 PM] liquid_phase#4605
You need to allow artists to sign up as artists and not just as a collection then - in my opinion. My ARTIST name is liquid phase(i make graphics AND music under this name) and the series is a debut series under the name. now you're essentially forcing me to change my entire artist persona and get rid of an entire series of art if i want to be listed on your site. That's not a fair ask. What is a fair ask is asking me to prove ownership or take down other works, which i am doing diligence on now.


[04/20/2022 2:47 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Adding a section to the form: "Any work on other chains? Link them here and reasons why." may be beneficial for your team - as would a section separating artist information from proposed collection info


[04/20/2022 2:54 PM] liquid_phase#4605
It is original, and one cant steal from themselves. He mentioned volume because he was trying to shut me up.


[04/20/2022 2:55 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Would still like to see your teams standards in writing and on your website, so its transparent for all creators and not just ones who have a problem


[04/20/2022 3:24 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
We thought it would be pretty obvious to be honest. Work on other chains doesn't concern us. Reminting the same nfts without ANY disclaimer does.


[04/20/2022 3:27 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
We do allow this. Your collection would simply be your artist name. You applied with 'liquid phase - 4d gods' so that's your collection under your artist name but separated. We aren't forcing you to change anything about 'liquid phase'. It seems like you're more intent on being annoyed we saw your eth art (very valid concern any buyer would have, do you not care about buyers?) than you are intent on actually getting your art listed responsibly.


[04/20/2022 3:47 PM] liquid_phase#4605
again, not minted - lazy minted. technicalities are important with intellectual property rights.


[04/20/2022 3:48 PM] liquid_phase#4605
You could have saved both mine and all of yours time by pre emptively putting a secion on the form to explain work on other chains


[04/20/2022 3:49 PM] liquid_phase#4605
because I actually do read the FAQs, and yours are sparse


[04/20/2022 3:49 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Yeah thats a mistake for a company, to assume their user base is any sort of competent or will use the product as designed


[04/20/2022 3:50 PM] liquid_phase#4605
I say this as a music publisher with over 42 releases on multiple platforms. If you do due diligence to a a point but not past that point you're no better than Spotify - which you may see as a good thing due to their size, but any musician in the industry hates spotify for their policies and would rather publish elsewhere if it were an option with similar reach


[04/20/2022 3:56 PM] liquid_phase#4605
I am actually just trying to help you -  i see your company as fledgling and this is a good opportunity to cause conflict and bring about a resolution from it - I feel that you should make changes to your application form to make sure others like me (artists who are just learning about crypto, not crypto kids who make art) don't bring about similar conflict in the future.

You can be offended or annoyed, that's fine - it's actually my intent. I don't care if you like me -  i am here to make change.


[04/20/2022 3:57 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091

just a thought, for the background behind a collections, maybe it would be cool to allow the artists to pick a banner or something to fill it out if they didnt want to leave it blank/default


[03/21/2023 11:49 PM] wombo22#5461
not sure if its possible but you know like the banners on twitter and such, just another little customizable thing for the artist
