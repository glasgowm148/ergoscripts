Can this be a public channel?  @glasgowm 
I have reached out to gupadhyaya#1654 about the opportunity to see if he has any additional comments since we spoke about the subject last. He‚Äôs very busy but hopefully I‚Äôll have some notes about moving the concept forward.


[03/06/2022 8:38 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah it is public


[03/06/2022 8:48 PM] Armeanio#0321
Xclaim it is something we can consider.

Mhs thinks the only thing to develop is a Ergo relayer, something like this? 
 https://github.com/ethereum/btcrelay

He thinks potentially it could  be NIPOPOW based too. 

Maybe we can start talking about the requirements and possible collaboration, grants,...

Technically, it could be done pretty easily it seems.

I would be very happy to see a bridge to one. Solid ecosystem.

The only complication, which I think ultimately is a long term benefit, is finding a way to provide liquidity on both sides to collateralize the lock up on both sides. 
There is also creating a front end for providing lock up collateral.
As well as a front end for bridging $ERG to and from the  $ONE blockchain


[03/07/2022 4:57 PM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
The interesting part, is that there was no additional $btc1 bridging because such is not easily possible on BTC but would be possible on $ERG‚Ä¶ although it would be great to just start with $ERG and move beyond that afterwards.


[03/07/2022 5:03 PM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
The complication of both creating a front end to basically stake $ERG or $ONE in order to support the bridge, and convincing the community to stake their funds on both sides. With some kind of incentive rewards to start, and then the bridge fee can be paid to the bridge stakers‚Ä¶

IMO it‚Äôs very simple from a tech side and Harmony should be willing to put forth some Liquidity to make the bridge functional to start.


[03/07/2022 8:34 PM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
Heard back from @gupadhyaya#1654 (Core dev at Harmony who's been leading the 1BTC bridge) and he's excited to move this project forward! I'll post on Talk.Harmony.one tonight and cross post on the Ergo forums as well... 

Anything I should know regarding how the ErgoFoundation might want to be involved? From speaking to the teams at ErgoPad, they were interested in providing liquidity for something like this.

Definitely stoked to bring my two favorite projects together! 

Thank you all for all you do! I'll update soon!

Planning to write something up on the ergo forums, to start a conversation over there about this post.

This is really exciting


[03/09/2022 8:34 PM] MGpai#4313
because this opens up the ecosystem to evm compatible blockchains


[03/09/2022 8:35 PM] MGpai#4313
Imagine some sort of intergration with DOT

I've spoken with Alexei before, planning to speak with him again soon


[03/10/2022 2:40 PM] Frosty#7344
our team has come to the same conclusion, having to build the relayer from scratch. I haven't considered NiPoPows, that's a sweet idea

@EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV where has this landed? Seems like an exciting possibility and i dont want to see it squandered


[03/19/2022 1:01 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
Sorry for the delay! I meant to get back sooner but didn't really have much to report other than they're discussing it.
https://talk.harmony.one/t/ergoplatform-erg-1erg-xclaim-bridge/13590/4
Currently they just reported back asking for some support for specifically why Ergo should receive funding/attention.

I responded but I'm certain there's other things I didn't list: if anyone else wants to comment.
