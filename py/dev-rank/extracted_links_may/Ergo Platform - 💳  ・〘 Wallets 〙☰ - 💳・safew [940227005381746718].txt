Topic: The goal of the project is to improve the security and the privacy of dApps on Ergo blockchain by providing a Wallet that:

allows to use your own node and explorer for the wallet inputs
can sign any transactions from a browser, allowing dApps without any backend transaction, inputs and outputs are visible when the user signs the transaction
adds the account level private derivation (EIP-3 BIP-32 BIP-44) to improve the privacy without using different wallets
is open-sourced Ergo wallet with a simple architecture

Hi, currently working on the ledger integration. As of now, I'm able to connect and discover the addresses to build the wallet. Still working on UI/feature adjustment around the wallet management before starting the transaction signing (I hope tomorrow).

Could you give a quick summary of what you completed over the past few days (to give everyone else a fair chance üòÖ) or maybe what you already had before if it's easier

dApp connector was already working so you've added Ledger support, tx history, and mixing? Why aren't you happy with the mixer part?


[02/14/2022 1:36 PM] haileypdll#3353
I've added the mixer part in the last few days, and the ledger integration.


[02/14/2022 1:40 PM] haileypdll#3353
The mixer part was done too quickly, it does not handle all the states of the mixes. The "Create new mix" would deserve to be integrated also. The Covert addresses are editable... but not for the token part and are not integrated in the other part of the wallet.


[02/14/2022 1:42 PM] haileypdll#3353
So it offers an integration of the ergomixer in the wallet, but incomplete, I hope it is still usable and not too buggy.


[02/14/2022 1:48 PM] haileypdll#3353
What I like in SAFEW, is the dApp connector commucation that I find cleanly done, and the different transactions balances displayed, computed from the transaction or unconfirmed transactions.


[02/14/2022 1:50 PM] haileypdll#3353
This gives some reliability to the displayed numbers (first displayed as input on the screen, then recomputed from the unsigned transaction, finally recomputed from the unconfirmed / confirmed transaction)

The transaction builder has just been added with the 0.4 release. It allows to build custom transactions with a UI.


[02/22/2022 11:44 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
is it compatible with ErgoPay?

Yes, there is a button to generates the ErgoPay QR code, you can use it with a readonly/ErgoPay wallet

may I recommend for the transaction export, being able to export without first "loading all"


[03/09/2022 8:27 AM] Dv#3650
I have 532 transactions in this wallet and I'm not sure if it'll ever load.... lol


[03/09/2022 8:31 AM] Dv#3650
nvm


[03/09/2022 8:32 AM] Dv#3650
export is broken


[03/09/2022 8:32 AM] Dv#3650
even if the transactions are loaded it's only exporting the last 3 days


[03/09/2022 8:32 AM] Dv#3650
sigh


[03/09/2022 2:15 PM] haileypdll#3353
Thanks, yes, there is an issue, it currently loads only 10 transactions per address, I will fix in the next release.


[03/09/2022 2:16 PM] haileypdll#3353
Currently testing with 400+ transactions in the wallet and the performance seems still fine to me. The exported file is less than 100kb, I will keep it as "export all" for now.


[03/09/2022 5:50 PM] haileypdll#3353

[03/10/2022 7:43 AM] haileypdll#3353
hmm, I will need more inputs, because it is working properly for me now. With 0.4.3 version ? with which browser ? Are you using a ErgoPay read only wallet or a wallet with mnemonic ?


[03/10/2022 7:56 AM] Dv#3650
Yes latest version you linked, Chrome, mnemonic


[03/10/2022 8:12 AM] Dv#3650
just tried the latest version with brave as well same issue.


[03/10/2022 8:25 AM] haileypdll#3353
Thanks, could you try to launch "Search used addresses" in the wallet edit screen and retry the export ? (with a fresh install from the link in Brave it is still working for me)


[03/10/2022 8:28 AM] Dv#3650
do I need to wait for the wallet to load all the transactions before attempting to export?

[03/10/2022 8:29 AM] haileypdll#3353
You don't need to wait to load all the transactions, you can just click the export button after having opened the screen.


[03/10/2022 8:30 AM] Dv#3650
I thought so, just making sure


[03/10/2022 8:30 AM] Dv#3650
Yea I'm not sure what the deal is then


[03/10/2022 8:30 AM] Dv#3650
Is it because of the amount of transactions I have in this wallet? I use it for mining, and it gets 4-5 per day


[03/10/2022 8:33 AM] haileypdll#3353
hmm, yes, that should be related to "mining wallet"


[03/10/2022 8:35 AM] haileypdll#3353
I have a mining wallet with less transactions than other wallets and the export was stuck for 30s (but it finally produced the file)


[03/10/2022 8:40 AM] haileypdll#3353
Thanks, I've now reproduced. It seems to occurs with "mining wallet" after a first export. I will investigate.


[03/10/2022 8:46 AM] Dv#3650
No problem thanks for the hard work!


[03/10/2022 8:49 AM] haileypdll#3353
Thanks, so it occurs when the explorer request fails, and this occurs for my "mining address" ,sometimes, fetching the transactions, I will try to handle it properly

Getting this error message when trying to sign a transaction in safew, can anyone tell me why this is happening?

"Transaction signing error: Prover error (tx input index 1): Failed on step2(prover does not have enough witnesses to perform the proof)"

@haileypdll would be the one to ask

I've tried the new version from https://github.com/tesseract-one/ledger-app-ergo/actions/runs/2203348990, but I still get an invalid signature leading to an error posting the transaction to node:


[04/22/2022 5:26 PM] haileypdll#3353
"Malformed transaction: Scripts of all transaction inputs should pass verification. f056a5b820c439f25df650b50bcd348fb63688465c1969ee0890db5ebc58fa2d: #0 => Success((false,10141))"


[04/22/2022 6:57 PM] glasgowm#9381
better asking @capt_nemo but the API has been rewritten so I imagine you'll need to rewrite something on your end too?


[04/23/2022 4:16 PM] haileypdll#3353
Thanks, it seems there is still some development on going on the ergo-ledger-hw-app before the integration can be done.

Is it possible to export all transactions from my address to csv with SAFEW wallet? There are over 2000 transactions received with this address.


[04/29/2022 1:43 PM] N3kurion#5318
When I want to export transactions to CSV it says: "Maximum number of transactions 500".

Hi, currently you can export only the last 500 of each address. But this is in my to do list to improve it.

[05/03/2022 7:59 PM] haileypdll#3353
Hi @N3kurion , you would need to get the list from ergo explorer API. Using a offset for old transactions. https://api.ergoplatform.com/api/v1/docs/#operation/getApiV1AddressesP1Transactions

[05/04/2022 1:05 PM] haileypdll#3353
I'm adding the github reply here, it can provides workarounds.

Thanks for reporting the issue.

This occurs for me when the transaction is "too big", and the QR code fails to be generated.
This is a limitation for transaction signed through QR code, around 4000 characters in the json of the transaction.
I will try to add a proper error message.

This may occurs because your wallet includes many unspent boxes.
As a workaround, you could try to consolidate your wallet before the transaction, by issuing a transaction to yourself, with all the wallet content. This should reduce the size of the ergodex transaction enough so it can be encoded in the QR code.

"Open wallet app": It works only to my knowledge on Android using SAFEW in Kiwi browser. It will open the Android Wallet to propose to sign the transaction. It could be used on Windows probably if a native wallet implement the feature.
This could also workaround your transaction size issue as the transaction will be sent to Android Wallet without QR code.

A future solution, will be the implementation of the second part of the Ergopay standard, with the "Ergopay payment request"...

[05/04/2022 7:21 PM] Velvia#6830
I tried the second solution, but the android wallet wasn't able to build the transaction

I don't know how to do it with a read only cold wallet


[05/04/2022 7:22 PM] Velvia#6830
I used yoroi back in the day to create the wallet in the first place, and it created additional addresses, so my ERG and tokens are all over


[05/04/2022 8:00 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
what was the problem in building the transaction?


[05/04/2022 8:58 PM] Velvia#6830
I don't remember the exact error, but something with "more than 64" and "not multiples of 4"


[05/04/2022 9:00 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042

[05/05/2022 7:48 PM] SoCool#6419
Hmm that's a strange thought but that would rely on a change to the ErgoPay spec to implement a continuation so it knew to continue reading more QRs


[05/05/2022 7:49 PM] SoCool#6419
Actually now that you mention it, I'm inclined to question if the issue with the ergopay link is a size limitation to the doms href, but I don't know what its limited at


[05/05/2022 7:50 PM] SoCool#6419
> The SGML Defines attributes with a limit set of 65k charecters, seen here
So yeah the QR code isn't outstripping the DOM attribute limit


[05/05/2022 7:51 PM] SoCool#6419
I just fucked up however I put it in there; I probably didn't use safe base64 encoding where I should have, I thought the QR codes bytes already had that but I'm a dummy and it of course had raw bytes not base64

[05/06/2022 12:33 AM] SoCool#6419
I fixed it! Except that **I AM TERRIBLE AT TESTING AND VERIFYING MY OWN CODE** so while I was able to submit a TX using the link from Kiwi, who knows what kinda screwy stupid thing I did that may have made it work / not work / whatever.

Don't expect the fix immediately available! I did however isolate the cause of the bug I believe and have a solution. Rely on the very talented Hailey to tell you if a fix makes it in or not and when heh

[06/24/2022 8:29 AM] haileypdll#3353
Hey, guys, I'm working on the CSV export of the transactions in SAFEW and cannot decide a point, could you please give your point of view ?

If you are exporting the transaction history for a specific address, do you expect the transaction balance computed only including that address ? Or including all the addresses of the wallet ?
With another words, exporting for a single address, for an intra wallet transaction, you expect the balance of the transaction to be only the miner fee or the transaction amount + miner fee ?


[06/24/2022 8:31 AM] haileypdll#3353
The transaction builder will show a warning. For a normal transaction, there will be no specific warning but the balance of the transaction will display that the tokens are going out of your wallet.

@haileypdll  any plans on the ability to add a read only wallet from public key? that way it can get all the derived addresses.


[08/01/2022 2:56 PM] haileypdll#3353
There is no real plan to do it. I think that a Extended public key would be required, with its chain_code (probably empty) and the derivation path to get it from the public key. These information would allow to get all the addresses for an "Account" in SAFEW.


[08/12/2022 2:47 PM] NoahErgo#4349

@haileypdll Any issues with dapp connector? Not able to make a connection today.


[08/18/2022 5:41 AM] haileypdll#3353
It is working for me...
You are facing an issue with which Browser, Safew version and dApp ?
There was a slight change in the isConnected function of the connector in the recent v0.6.6 version, it now returns a Promise instead of a boolean in case the wallet is not connected (like Nautilus), this seems not a big change but maybe some dApp have an issue with that.


[08/18/2022 3:27 PM] theta_decay#5677
Thank you for the response. Using Brave browser, Safew Version 0.6.6, the dapp is Ergopad.


[08/19/2022 8:12 AM] haileypdll#3353
Thanks, ok, reproduced, I'll publish a v0.6.7 to address it soon. 
As a workaround, you can connect "manually":
 - Open the ergopad.io page
 - Use F12 key to open the developper tools, select the "console" tab
 - Run the following command in the console: ergoConnector.safew.connect()
 - Click the ergopad "Connect with Nautilus or Safew" button

would anyone be able to help me with SAFEW? trying to send ergo to another wallet, everything looks fine, sign with password, it spins for a bit and returns to the transaction list. but no new transaction ever shows up, balance doesn't change


[12/02/2022 8:15 AM] haileypdll#3353
When it fails sending the transaction, could you open the console developper tool in your browser ("Ctrl + Shift + J" on Chrome) to check if you can find an error there ?


[12/02/2022 7:16 PM] ambrose#5060
thanks i'll try that!


[12/09/2022 4:06 AM] ambrose#5060
@haileypdll looks like firefox was trying to enforce https-only mode and it broke the transaction


[12/17/2022 11:08 AM] haileypdll#3353

hello i sent from this safew wallet    9gXVRBzn7rdh3tcRGVotbumzAYd74Wsb7JEdYANgxoLQMo3xGzY  to exchange but nothiing happens since hours


[01/31/2023 7:28 AM] haileypdll#3353
Hello, the last trasaction for this address is from the 22th January, somehow the transaction has not been validated.
SAFEW "just" displays the information from the explorer. 
At any time you can check your balance and the transactions directly in the explorer or using another wallet with the same mnemonic.

[01/31/2023 8:39 AM] chopchopSamir#1393
OK but UTXO are spent

{"error":400,"reason":"bad.request","detail":"Double spending attempt"}


[01/31/2023 9:05 AM] chopchopSamir#1393
and they dont show up anywhere


[01/31/2023 1:45 PM] haileypdll#3353
The UTXOs are taken from: https://api.ergoplatform.com/api/v1/boxes/unspent/byAddress/9gXVRBzn7rdh3tcRGVotbumzAYd74Wsb7JEdYANgxoLQMo3xGzY  ... this double spending error can occurs sending several transactions in a row... but I've never saw it when all the transactions of the wallet are confirmed. Are you using a custom explorer or node URL ?


[01/31/2023 1:47 PM] chopchopSamir#1393
using chrome on an Imac

That looks like the right one.


[01/31/2023 2:15 PM] haileypdll#3353
You could try to change the explorer url in the configuration to use the one from anetaBTC: https://ergo-explorer.anetabtc.io/ Or try to restore the mnemonic in another wallet, Nautilus for example as a browser extension.

When we log out on front-end, the user still needs to open SAFEW and remove dapp connector

Nautilus offers this solution `await ergoConnector.nautilus.disconnect()`

Hello, there is the same for SAFEW that seems to work for me: await ergoConnector.safew.disconnect()

It seems there was an issue with the default node used by safew to send the transaction. That should be better now: https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/669989266478202917/1070779421461594252

any advice on the steps i can take to resolve it?


[03/06/2023 12:15 PM] haileypdll#3353
Hello, the error message says that the guard script of the inputs(0) replied "false" so the box cannot be spent. Basically it can be signing with wrong wallet. How the transaction is generated?


[03/06/2023 12:31 PM] c8e4d2a#9854
understood, have some weird nautilus/safew interference. Will try it again with a browser which has safew only installed. will take a while


[03/06/2023 12:47 PM] cafebedouin#9837
That might be your problem right there, only one extension. At a time or you'll get weird behavior.


[03/06/2023 1:06 PM] haileypdll#3353
Yes, you can just disable one of them, and keep both installed.

[03/07/2023 1:42 PM] c8e4d2a#9854
The problem is with this line of code:
```
ergoConnector.nautilus.connect();
```
this connects to SAFEW, seems like a bug


[03/07/2023 1:43 PM] c8e4d2a#9854
it should not connect to safew, in what ever configuration.


[03/07/2023 2:47 PM] haileypdll#3353
It connects to SAFEW because Spectrum uses that function to connect and never merged the SAFEW support. I'll remove it when it will not be necessary anymore...


[03/07/2023 2:50 PM] c8e4d2a#9854

Hello, 
There is a demo of the SAFEW transaction builder usage if that can help. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N7Qn2BgH0U 
Looked at the messages in Nautilus thread but I'm not sure what's your issue.
Neither how you would like to fix it.
If you can share the failing transaction or you address in PM, I might be able to check.


[04/07/2023 6:08 AM] openai_bot#6772
Summary of the video:
and see that the transaction is confirmed

-Ergo is a cryptocurrency
-You can send cryptocurrency to multiple people in one transaction using the transaction builder
-The transaction builder creates an input, a minor fee, a first recipient box, a second recipient box, and a change box
-The input is the amount of cryptocurrency being sent
-The minor fee is the fee for the transaction
-The first and second recipient boxes are for the people receiving the cryptocurrency
-The change box is for any cryptocurrency not sent to the recipients


[04/08/2023 5:38 AM] Bryce#8378

‚ö†Ô∏è Several node are stuck and the SAFEW transaction may fails. Currently https://ergo-node.zoomout.io/ is in a good shape and you could use it to fix the issue.
