@kushti I'm running distributed-sig branch which I updated a few weeks ago. Should I update?


[10/08/2020 12:01 PM] kushti#0978
@anon_real yes, and please test


[10/08/2020 12:01 PM] kushti#0978
ordinary pubkey starting with 9... is enough


[10/08/2020 12:30 PM] anon_real#2768
@kushti Updated to the latest commit on distributed-sig but now I can't set api key in node's panel. It says bad api key.


[10/08/2020 12:38 PM] kushti#0978
@anon_real "distributed-signatures" now btw


[10/08/2020 12:38 PM] kushti#0978

[10/08/2020 1:14 PM] anon_real#2768

[10/08/2020 5:09 PM] kushti#0978
@anon_real your point against putting keys into registers (at least for now) is reasonable. Then we can do this:


[10/08/2020 5:09 PM] kushti#0978
atLeast(2, Coll(PK("9i3Qzr12oGobnKUs6GgyVPLqWSgNsmccXevKXFoCpPTMcHxArS8"),PK("9i3Qzr12oGobnKUs6GgyVPLqWSgNsmccXevKXFoCpPTMcHxArS8"), PK("9i3Qzr12oGobnKUs6GgyVPLqWSgNsmccXevKXFoCpPTMcHxArS8")))

[10/09/2020 2:41 PM] filippounits#3593
https://github.com/anon-real/DistributedSigsClient should be a bit more detailed. But is my fault, I'm not that techy guy and there's high probability that I'm not understand well what I need to do for it

looks like fixed on my side with 3.3.5


[10/15/2020 10:19 AM] filippounits#3593
Active sync on my 3.3.5 but it look very slow synching. Should be my bad internet connection, there's also very bad weather here today.


[10/15/2020 10:44 AM] kushti#0978
@filippounits you can generate keys with no syncing . On bad connections, it would be good to check it ) Supposedly, 3.3.5 should recover after connectivity being lost


[10/15/2020 10:50 AM] filippounits#3593
let me try to restart the router with the node active

no recover after connection lost


[10/15/2020 11:00 AM] filippounits#3593
but could be also that f****** internet connection. I'm really pissed off


[10/15/2020 11:03 AM] kushti#0978
How long did you wait for a recovery? Few mins needed


[10/15/2020 11:03 AM] filippounits#3593
about 5 min


[10/15/2020 11:04 AM] filippounits#3593
I've just restated the node

[02/17/2021 10:30 AM] glasgowm#9381
Any reason we're not hosting a demo of this?


[02/17/2021 5:05 PM] kushti#0978
good question @anon_real I guess it is proper time to show it to public ?


[02/17/2021 5:05 PM] kushti#0978
I mean to run some public instance

@kushti @glasgowm I had some plans to rework it and make it easier to use since I have more experience now.

Copy here for people to play with btw: https://zkt.ergonaut.space/

How does it work ? I made a test foundation but it's not clear how one would verify as that foundation, or approve proposals or anything


[04/01/2021 10:57 PM] Dergler#0451
yea I ran into those issues, then i found out that there's a need for front end dev work on ergo.


[04/01/2021 10:58 PM] Dergler#0451
I've picked up the torch but I'm still learning to light it.

you also need to run a client and a node


[04/15/2021 2:18 AM] Dergler#0451
so the UI at zkt.ergonaut.space is more a portal just for that treasury's set of teams and proposals?


[04/15/2021 2:07 PM] anon_real#2768
The server is where users go and request for funds.


[04/15/2021 2:07 PM] anon_real#2768
The client is what team members run and participate in distributed signature.


[04/15/2021 4:47 PM] glasgowm#9381
oh I must've missed the client git. Will have a look


[01/18/2022 1:38 AM] JOFLITO#9983
Hi, is it working?


[01/18/2022 1:38 AM] JOFLITO#9983

nope that was just a preview one I was hosting a while ago. Each person needs to run it locally


[03/09/2022 2:08 AM] Adoo#5093
@anon_real I was testing the ZK Treasury solution.

1. ZK Server is running on 1 node.
2. ZK Client is running on 2 nodes.
3. Created a 2/2 multi sig box with the following script
```{
val pkA  = SELF.R4[GroupElement].get
val pkB  = SELF.R5[GroupElement].get

atLeast(2, Coll(proveDlog(pkA), proveDlog(pkB)))
}```
4. The transaction was built and posted on mainnet using appkit - https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/77b0010784bed74c468d435ae6b29b15211d03772b95b45f7cbae8a5576b4361
5. I entered the address of output box in the 'Address' column while creating a team on ZK-Server.
6. I created a proposal to withdraw some funds on ZK-Server.
7. The proposal is visible on both ZK-Clients.
8. While trying to accept the proposal, I get the following error.

Please guide on what I am doing wrong.

I think neither of them are subscribed to this channel so they may not have gotten the message

Hey, does anybody know how to change the slick jdbc username & password in a client's & server's config?


[07/17/2022 10:58 AM] sakata#4279
I get an unexpected exception whenever they are changed
