ErgoPool is a pool in development by @mhs_sam  . Not related to Ergo core team or Ergo Foundation


[01/30/2020 7:28 AM] mhs_sam#1471
Dear Ergo Community, I would like to announce that the first mining pool for Ergo is coming in the following days. This pool is using collaterals and smart contracts, and it would be almost open-sourced. Technically, we do not have control over what you mine but as an arbiter collect the money and distribute it to the miners. So, the pool is censorship-resistant and somehow decentralized. We hope this step in Ergo mining at the beginning of 2020, mitigates the obstacles of Ergo mining for small/medium miners and spreads the words of Ergo. So please follow this thread for the news.


[01/30/2020 7:34 AM] mhs_sam#1471
to this end, both amd miner and nv miner are modified to support the pool mining.

@ICEman working hard on it. Some last minute bugs are found in integration, we will deliver soon. Also, working on AMD miner at the same time to improve the hashrate.
 So not far, maybe today I hope

[02/19/2020 12:42 AM] mhs_sam#1471
ergopool.io is live now for tester!


[02/19/2020 12:45 AM] mhs_sam#1471
We are on testnet for a few days, if you want to contribute and test the pool plz send us your erg adrs on testnet, we'll send you some test ergs to start mining.
Btw, ui is not complete yet and will be finalized in the following days.
So let the journey begin!

@scalahub we are offline due to migration, we'll be up in 2-3 days on mainnet

is there a step-by-step guide?

@scalahub I see, okay


[03/06/2020 7:17 PM] scalahub#2618

Dear miners, the ergopool.io is going to be operational on mainnet in a few days, just after node 3.2.7 release.

@scalahub now you can use nv miner to mine with ergopool. until it is merged with the official NV miner you can use my fork: https://github.com/mhssamadani/Autolykos-GPU-miner

[09/21/2020 10:45 AM] ponte#8953
is it a problem on my side or a pool thing?


[09/21/2020 11:03 AM] mehran#0528
Hi @ponte, What is the current height of your node?


[09/21/2020 11:05 AM] ponte#8953
@mehran hi! oh i see it's 314370


[09/21/2020 11:05 AM] ponte#8953
so problem is in my node


[09/21/2020 11:06 AM] mehran#0528
Yeah, somehow your node is out of sync and your shares get rejected.


[09/21/2020 11:06 AM] ponte#8953
should i full resync? like from 0 ?


[09/21/2020 11:07 AM] mehran#0528
I'm not sure, maybe restarting the node solves the problem.
If not, I think you should resync from scratch? @kushti


[09/21/2020 11:07 AM] ponte#8953
i already restarted couple of times...


[09/21/2020 11:07 AM] mehran#0528
Are you using docker?


[09/21/2020 11:08 AM] ponte#8953
no, just downloaded the jar


[09/21/2020 11:09 AM] ponte#8953
strange is that the node panel says "node is synced"


[09/21/2020 11:09 AM] mehran#0528
> no, just downloaded the jar
@ponte I have experienced this in case of electricity outage or just force shut downing the node.


[09/21/2020 11:10 AM] mehran#0528
> 
> strange is that the node panel says "node is synced"
> @ponte Maybe check its peers in swagger?


[09/21/2020 11:10 AM] mehran#0528
maybe it can not connect to any other nodes.


[09/21/2020 11:12 AM] ponte#8953
@mehran i got lot of peers connected

btw i'll try with a full resync


[09/21/2020 11:15 AM] ponte#8953
strange is that in my peers list there is me


[09/21/2020 11:15 AM] ponte#8953
or maybe not strange dunno 😄


[09/21/2020 11:16 AM] mehran#0528
I'm not sure )
You can also try to connect it to other nodes in swagger. That helps sometimes.


[09/21/2020 11:16 AM] mehran#0528
for example to this one: http://88.198.13.202:9053/


[09/21/2020 11:16 AM] ponte#8953
ok, i'll try to add this to my peers


[09/21/2020 11:17 AM] ponte#8953
i'll do that later in couple hours and if it doesn't work i'll try resync


[09/21/2020 11:18 AM] ponte#8953
thanks @mehran i'll let you know


[09/21/2020 11:18 AM] mehran#0528
> thanks @mehran i'll let you know
@ponte No problem.


[09/21/2020 11:51 AM] kushti#0978
@ponte restart helps, did you have connectivity issues ?


[09/21/2020 12:06 PM] ponte#8953
@kushti i tried restart even after rebooting but nothing changes... connectivity don't know, i mean my pc is online as i'm reaching it from remote... i'll try adding a peer in the list and if nothing change i'll resync from 0


[09/21/2020 3:42 PM] kushti#0978
@ponte can you send me logs please ?


[09/21/2020 4:38 PM] ponte#8953
@kushti sure lemme see if i can find the right day


[09/21/2020 4:39 PM] ponte#8953
'cos it happened couple weeks ago (didn't had the time to check before today)


[09/21/2020 5:00 PM] ponte#8953
mmm @kushti it's almost impossible to find in which day occurred, logs are hundreds Mb of text... i think better wait for my sync that's going and wait if it happens again


[09/21/2020 5:01 PM] ponte#8953
or maybe there's some trick to find that "happening" without ditching all the logs? can't cat and grep cos i'm on windows


[09/21/2020 6:46 PM] kushti#0978
> mmm @kushti it's almost impossible to find in which day occurred, logs are hundreds Mb of text... i think better wait for my sync that's going and wait if it happens again
@ponte would be problematic without grep )


[09/21/2020 6:53 PM] kushti#0978
@ponte some (likely related ) improvements planned for 3.3.5


[09/21/2020 6:54 PM] ponte#8953
Cool! Will the ergopool work with 3.3.5 ? I'm stuck in 3.2.7 due to pool experiment

@mehran @kushti hi there, so my node had the issue again: node and pool stopped being in sync at block 323896 or 323895 so i think the log i'm sending contains the issue:

what is the simplest way to particpate in ergopool? should I use windows/linux and are there any precompiled binaries? The only restriction is I have nvidia cards


[10/27/2020 6:10 PM] scalahub#2618
and which node versions

> what is the simplest way to particpate in ergopool? should I use windows/linux and are there any precompiled binaries? The only restriction is I have nvidia cards
@scalahub 

now the simplest way is proxy docker image otherwise, use jar file, with node version 3.2.7, proxy yet not compatible with 3.3.x
new version of the proxy that is currently being prepared is compatible with 3.3.x and is easier to work with.

for nv miner you can using [https://github.com/mhssamadani/Autolykos-GPU-miner/tree/master]
