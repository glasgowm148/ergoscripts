thank you


[11/11/2021 1:33 PM] Kir0#2114
will start with what i wanted to ask:
are improvements possible on transaction finality and block time?
can fees be reduced or changed relative to ERG price or are they fixed at 0.01?

block time can't change on the base layer without a HF. Improvements are possible with solutions on top though.

Tx fees are adjustable, but there's research into feeless networks for #deleted-channel

Hey Ergo Team - are there any plans to start a board of advisors? Specifically, Ergo having small team of different skillset-having individuals weighing in on the direction of Ergo as a platform. We have Dan F., who of course would have a seat at the table, but having others with notable skillsets would also be of use. Either way, I'd be interested in volunteering time to such a position for sheer interest in improving the ecosystem; I am a software deployment specialist/manager/director for a large healthcare IT company - the largest in the world.

Is uneven liquidity working as expected on ErgoDex?


[11/13/2021 8:38 PM] teamslow#0524
what is the ERG_SigUSD_LP asset that shows up in your wallet when you provide liquidity via ergodex?


[11/13/2021 9:06 PM] LowKeyNerd#0001
I believe that is simply your return on investment basically.


[11/13/2021 9:13 PM] teamslow#0524
it doesnt look like a real asset to me...     although i was wondering how the fees end up being deposited... i imagine it would happen in some period rate...


[11/13/2021 9:15 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
The LP tokens represent your share in the liquidity pool. Fees are added to the pool every time a transaction occurs so your LP tokens increase in value


[11/13/2021 9:16 PM] teamslow#0524
oh ok


[11/13/2021 9:17 PM] teamslow#0524
so how are they realized as a return as erg or sigma?


[11/13/2021 9:17 PM] teamslow#0524
is there anyway to view the value of the return as another asset?


[11/13/2021 9:18 PM] teamslow#0524
thanks for the info


[11/13/2021 10:18 PM] weirdhousenoisesat837pmeveryday#4778
Right now it‚Äôs a manual process. You click on the pair you provided under the pool section and it will show you the value of your LP tokens in the each currency leg of the pair. Then you‚Äôd have to compare that value to what it was when you first deposited them in the pool.


[11/13/2021 10:18 PM] weirdhousenoisesat837pmeveryday#4778
Likely the next iteration of the UI will include some return metrics.


[11/13/2021 10:27 PM] teamslow#0524

The parts you blurred, that‚Äôs the value of your position


[11/13/2021 10:31 PM] teamslow#0524
ohhhh ok


[11/13/2021 10:32 PM] teamslow#0524
so the fees will be added in either one of the pair sides based on which direction the swap is going?


[11/13/2021 10:32 PM] weirdhousenoisesat837pmeveryday#4778
Yeah so you have to look up how much it was when you first contributed in order to calculate return


[11/13/2021 10:32 PM] weirdhousenoisesat837pmeveryday#4778
That‚Äôs right

A lot of people are having issues with Uneven Liquidity Pool on Ergodex, @glasgowm who is the best person to message, ergodex discord is largely inactive right now


[11/14/2021 12:29 AM] LowKeyNerd#0001
Specifically it's showing the incorrect amounts based off what was originally given. Seems to be a graphical bug.


[11/14/2021 12:36 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
That may be true, but it actually seems to be paying the wrong amount


[11/14/2021 12:40 AM] glasgowm#9381
What do you mean uneven liquidity pool? Ilya is best for bugs but he'll be asleep


[11/14/2021 12:44 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
As in the DEX allows users to input liquidity not at 50/50 ratio


[11/14/2021 12:44 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
So something very unbalanced would be 100 Erg : 2 sigusd


[11/14/2021 12:45 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Which is allowed, and in my experience pays the same LP as 0.2 Erg: 2 SigUSD (Taking 1 Erg = $10)


[11/14/2021 12:47 AM] LowKeyNerd#0001
@glasgowm def something going on visually at least. I submitted 481 erg to sidusd, only showing as like 300


[11/14/2021 12:48 AM] LowKeyNerd#0001
Examples can be seen above.


[11/14/2021 12:51 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Did you submit an even ratio? or uneven btw?


[11/14/2021 12:53 AM] LowKeyNerd#0001
Just basic link pair, even/default ratio.


[11/14/2021 12:54 AM] LowKeyNerd#0001
Like sent 500 erg, swapped to sigusd. Sent another 500 erg. Went to pools, paired the two assets.


[11/14/2021 12:55 AM] LowKeyNerd#0001
Shows around 300 vs the ~489 I actually submitted.

Several others are having that same problem. Can show transactions if needed. Main concern is people just deleting their coins somehow, because that will blow up v fast.

[11/14/2021 1:54 AM] LowKeyNerd#0001
Amount matches the amount in the Wallet, which is good. But, the calculation of said LP tokens worth is off quite a bit. I gave a 500 ERG ratio = ~5k USD and it's sitting at about ~300 ERG = ~3k USD. Showing about 40% less than what it should.

This is redeeming for 200 less erg than it should.


[11/14/2021 1:56 AM] LowKeyNerd#0001
and about 2000 less sigUSD


[11/14/2021 1:59 AM] LowKeyNerd#0001
Beta view still let's you see token amounts themselves. Either tokens are being distributed incorrectly or the math is wrong.


[11/14/2021 1:59 AM] LowKeyNerd#0001
Should be escalated to whatever teams/devs this needs escalating to.

May be worth seeing what happens when you remove liquidity


[11/14/2021 3:41 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
The 2700 missing would allign perfectly well with what the value of LP was yesterday


[11/14/2021 3:41 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Cause by calculations your 260 million or so should have been only 1450 Sigusd


[11/14/2021 3:41 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
which is about that 2700 less

[11/14/2021 9:48 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
And im glad they removed the ability to provide uneven liquidity. Will people be able to issue refunds if they provided at an uneven ratio?


[11/14/2021 10:19 AM] glasgowm#9381
It's for slippage I believe so you're arbitraged automatically. The user above didn't provide at an uneven ratio though, but the pool was at an uneven ratio.


[11/14/2021 10:24 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Yeah, that makes sense for the slippage (similar to how when you swap large amounts you receive a lesser rate), but what about for uneven liquidity?


[11/14/2021 10:40 AM] glasgowm#9381
uneven liquidity is the 'slippage', it's used for depositing liquidity with a volatile price.

Mick Ergo, [11/14/2021 5:18 AM]
I think posting a pin-level post to both subreddits once this is resolved is going to be the best course of action. I don't think the response being shared right now is going to be understood by 99% of people. I can't fathom it at this point either - there was no indication that the pool was uneven at the time of submitting a standard even pair of LP eligible coins.

Mick Ergo, [11/14/2021 5:22 AM]
Ilya Oskin, [14/11/21 6:25 PM][In reply to Mick Ergo] The guy deposited at rate ~9.28$ per ERG to a pool which had a rate of 3.55$/ERG in that moment

Ilya Oskin, [14/11/21 6:25 PM] So that is his valid LP share

Mick Ergo, [11/14/2021 5:22 AM]
Per @oskin ‚Äî "In the UI, it seems there was a fluctuation in reserves ratio when your page was already loaded
But I feel like it's more like a problem of UI, we can't require users to constantly keep refreshing the page to see actual reserve ratio. So we would like to reimburse you. On our side we will add dynamic pool reserves updates in the UI."

I need enlightenment on art NFTs, how they work on our current system outside the blockchain? Let's say I have one NFT, and people all over the internet start using these as profiles on twitter, telegram and so on, what exactly do I own? I'm really missing something. I understand how certificates and documents would work as NFTs as proof of accomplishment, but these are barely being used


[11/20/2021 9:36 AM] Kir0#2114
you own the "patent" / the certificate of ownership / proof of ownership


[11/20/2021 9:36 AM] Kir0#2114
NFT are still in their infancy but the concept is the same as when you would get a PRODUCT KEY / LICENSE


[11/20/2021 9:37 AM] Kir0#2114
or when you buy a physical piece of art with certificate of authenticity.


[11/20/2021 9:38 AM] Kir0#2114
the point is, informed buyer knows who has the real nft. JPEGS are bad examples and mainly speculative bubbles atm because the world is still discovering how to use them (NFTS).


[11/20/2021 12:07 PM] Hamilton#4703
What I thought then, you basically outside the blockchain, doesn't really own much


[11/20/2021 2:20 PM] Kir0#2114
As i told you, the world is discovering it's usage. One could auction a van Gogh painting and instead of the paper certificate sell an nft for it. The owner could then sell the nft worldwide for bids to pass the ownership of the painting for example if a painting was held by a museum


[11/20/2021 3:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
art in real world is mostly used for avoiding taxes, and NFTs are used for that too.

Does Bitcoins taproot upgrade threaten the broader blockchain ecosystem? If for example large numbers of developers start building Dapps on the Bitcoin ecosystem why should users go anywhere else? And I have no experience with software development so I‚Äôd appreciate a developers opinion on my next question. Why not develop on Bitcoin? Thank you to anyone who answers.


[11/20/2021 5:59 PM] apexpool#3878
Developers are not used to UTxO, they will not go to bitcoin.

Is developing on UTXO different than eUTXO?

taproot just enables simple zero knowledge proofs and a few other little things - there won't be rich smart-contracts.


[11/20/2021 6:21 PM] glasgowm#9381
means erg can do trustless cross-chain swaps with btc tho ^^


[11/20/2021 6:30 PM] Milk-Stout337#7586
So Bitcoin having a robust Dapp ecosystem is nowhere in sight? In the scaling solutions article by the ergo foundation it states ergo is compatible with UTXO layer 2 solutions like Bitcoins lighting network. Does that also mean Bitcoin can use layer twos built on ergo? Is Ergo in essence Bitcoin that is ahead of the curve so to speak? I appreciate the responses


[11/20/2021 6:32 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah it won't have capabilities anywhere near what erg has. Scaling solutions are just for throughput - BTC may be able to use something else ERG could - but in general it's rigid and erg is adaptable.

Last question then.  Will adoption affect Ergos adaptability?


[11/20/2021 6:46 PM] glasgowm#9381
not sure what you mean - more adoption = more devs fleshing out erg so in a way yes


[11/20/2021 6:51 PM] Milk-Stout337#7586
I thought a big reason Bitcoin is rigid or hard to update (soft fork) it too many people disagree on proposals. I‚Äôm wholly ignorant on the matter.


[11/20/2021 7:01 PM] glasgowm#9381
yep - but you can do a lot more with soft-forks on ergo because the base layer is a decade ahead. It's hard-forks that are more an issue.


[11/20/2021 7:11 PM] Milk-Stout337#7586
Thank you for the information!


[11/20/2021 7:11 PM] Hamilton#4703
I guess one of the down sides of true decentralization (in this case the lack of the foundation) is that it is probably really hard for people to agree on upgrades


[11/20/2021 7:12 PM] Hamilton#4703
Usually with a foundation behind the project, people have the choice of disagreeing with changes, but they have something to trust

I heard that cardano may need to develop fee market(like eth gas fee) because of increasing transaction volume. Will ergo face the same problem in the future if user increase?


[11/21/2021 10:33 AM] glasgowm#9381
erg already has a fee market I believe (transactions can increase fee to take priority), and it's not like gas.


[11/21/2021 10:33 AM] Holden#1501
oh thank you


[11/21/2021 10:35 AM] Holden#1501
can you  eli5 how its different from gas for layperson please?


[11/21/2021 10:42 AM] glasgowm#9381
for eth there's gas penalties, per tx limits, unpredictability. Gas 'drives' the eth virtual machine.

ADA/ERG use eUTXO for which costs are predictable, the heavy lifting is done off-chain so you'll never see insane 'gas-like' prices like you do in the bloated account-model, tokens are forged on-chain so no tx fee required to transact native tokens, etc.

[11/21/2021 2:57 PM] andee#4722
a swap on Ethereum can spend $40 of gas without being able to complete because of a sudden rise of gas fees leaving you with nothing but an expense. A UTxO transaction will execute until completion as long as it gets included in a block

@glasgowm what language could be used to code in ergo? i'm currently diving into programming and setting up my study roadmap. know solidity is used in eth and python could be used for algorand. is scala the only language for ergo? sorry for my noobishness


[11/23/2021 10:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
You can code in a bunch of languages. Appkit supports JVM (scala,java, kotlin, JavaScript, C/C++, Python, Ruby, R) (tutorial/video available)

http://docs.ergoplatform.org/dev/stack/appkit/

If you mean writing actual smart-contracts it's done in ErgoScript and there's an ergoscript by example repo and other resources here

What‚Äôs our take around the negative sentiment with regards to PoW mining?


[11/28/2021 6:55 PM] Marty#4039
Anyone who comes into crypto because they want an iteration on the current financial system which allows the rich to rig everything is fooling themselves if they think PoS will change that


[11/28/2021 6:58 PM] Marty#4039
The richest holders get the most votes and can change the system to suit their needs. The validators are selected by the users. Staking rewards are higher for the richest holders, and that will never change because there's no competition, no market externalities, like PoW. 

POW has multiple parties vying for control. Miners who have to keep buying new hardware, maintain their hardware, spend their income (keeps the economy moving). Node operators who can decide which software updates to push through, not necessarily the same ones the miners want, and then wealthy holders who can't just hold their money AND be the biggest miners. It takes spending to get there. The argument that PoW helps the wealthiest and yet PoS doesn't is not based in reality, it's more based on a pipe dream that you can have a secure, decentralized network without any economic principals behind it


[11/28/2021 6:58 PM] Marty#4039
The argument only holds water if you're talking to people who think blockchain is a worthwhile energy expenditure..if they don't, it's just a waste of energy no matter what you say.


[11/28/2021 6:59 PM] Marty#4039
The only argument against those people is: do they think it's worth spending energy on a global financial system that provides fair access to all? Do they think the energy wasted on TV watching, Christmas lights, and other frivolous things is more valid than.on blockchain?


[11/28/2021 7:01 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah you can do it, but not in yoroi. Maybe could be added to android


[11/28/2021 7:01 PM] Marty#4039
Saying PoS is a replacement for PoW is like saying a car without a motor is an environmentally friendly replacement for a car with a motor because it uses less fuel. Doesn't mean it functions the same or better.


[11/28/2021 7:02 PM] Marty#4039

And it doesnt give me a clear picture of how the normal dev workflow is suppose to work.  Can someone describe a normal Dev Workflow for me? ie. describe your local dev environment and how I push my work to TestNet to Mainnet? ie. should I be running a FullNode (is this TestNet), and calling transactions to my local testnet through API.

since the desired block time is 120 seconds, what do you have in mind?


[12/11/2021 11:50 AM] somn0z#3708
I think i worded it poorly, normally confirmation time of an transaction is like you stated is around 120s, reducing the confirmation time would result in the bc becoming more centralized, my question is if there is a way to reduce the block time and still keep the same level of decentralization?


[12/11/2021 11:52 AM] FlyingPig#2854
That would be a hard fork which i don't see happen. Why would you need to reducde the block time? 2 minutes should be enough?
Having said that I whish the explorer updated more frequently. It's often slow and it takes 5-10 minutes before I see a transaction as confirmed.

I have a question about nfts and Ergo Utils. Let's say I have audio that was meant to loop and I wanted it attached to an animated loop for constant playback. Is there support for attaching audio to a gif instead of issuing a video NFT, or are video loops supported?

If the block time is 120 seconds, how will trading on the dex allow close to real time transactions?


[12/14/2021 9:57 PM] Welly#3430
I have an incredibly random question. But this is ask-anything so I figure it‚Äôs ok right? One of the things that has attracted me to Ergo is that it‚Äôs a store of value, like BTC, like gold. First question is that am I right that a store of value works because there is finite supply? The second question is therefore while there is finite supply of a particular coin, say BTC, how does the constant influx of (seemingly infinite) new entrants affect that store of value. If I take gold as an example, nobody can come along and market me Gold 2.0 or DogeGold the next day. Does it also therefore follow that as the newer entrants bring better solutions to the table that BTC has to depreciate at some point (because we all know Gold 2.0 is better)? This would mean BTC can‚Äôt be a true store of value because it can be replicated and/or bettered upon? My head hurts thinking about this


[12/14/2021 10:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yes on the finite supply - you're mining it just like gold.

I'm not sure what you mean with the Gold 2.0 comment - arguably BTC is exactly that. Gold does have an intrinsic value but it does not match its market value.


[12/14/2021 10:33 PM] Welly#3430
Thanks for taking the time to reply. What I was trying to get at is that there is a finite supply of accessible gold. I can‚Äôt make a substitute. There is a finite supply of BTC, but I could make an entirely similar blockchain or a better substitute. How does this impact on that original store of value?


[12/14/2021 10:35 PM] Welly#3430
I‚Äôll reflect and see if I can articulate the question better


[12/15/2021 12:07 AM] glasgowm#9381
You can make a substitute as the value is derived from it being a store or value, not intrinsic. So a substitute would be any superior store of value


[12/15/2021 9:16 AM] andee#4722
People buying specialized equipment to mine combined with consumption of electricity does set a floor price, it also gives confidence in the network since there is so much money invested in it. Liquidity is very good so even large companies can buy and be certain that they are able to sell if they have to liquidate their position. Adding all the other use cases like being able to transfer wealth all across the world regardless of sanctions, bypassing the 10% (or so) places like western union charge immigrants for sending money back home to their families etc. one of the main reasons why I think a lot of people see BTC as a store of value is because it is relatively simple and has been proven to be very resillient with a great uptime since its inception combined with having a finite supply

Generally also interested to know how to increase the transactions in real time, as far as I've understood it, l2 solutions will only have an effect on the amount of tx within one block?

Hello, considering the storage-rent fee applied to wallets which are dormant for 4 years or more, the whitepaper has this to say:
> a miner may charge a small fee for every byte kept in the state.

How is this "small fee" determined? Is it proportional to the amount held? And does receiving a transaction reset this 4 year timer?


[12/16/2021 3:03 PM] glasgowm#9381
https://www.ergoforum.org/t/storage-rent-details/256

~0.13 for an ordinary box (based on byte size), don't think receiving would as it's per UTXO not address/wallet.

Storage rent details
In this post I am going to reveal some details about storage rent.  Ergo has pretty aggressive emission curve with all the ergs being emitted in just 8 years. To provide stability after the emission being done, Ergo is introducing storage rent, which is pretty flexible and sophisticated. There are two basic mechanisms in regards with the storage...

Yall im using 84% of my PSU (thermaltake Gold 850watt). This is my 3rd rig and not normal but I got another 3070 and had to put it to use. I move back into all of my equipment in 25 days. Do you think it would be able to run at 84% all safe and efficient for 25 days?


[12/19/2021 2:40 AM] nearozero#8852
i think you are right. gold has intrinsic value, cryptos do not. what cryptos have is network value .. read about Metcalfe‚Äôs Law. The ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of bitcoin is proportional the square of the number of users on the network. The price of bitcoin is just the intersection of supply and demand.


[12/19/2021 2:42 AM] nearozero#8852
i have a question.. is there any news about potential changes to ergo emission schedule?


[12/19/2021 9:48 AM] Welly#3430
Thank you, I‚Äôll take a look. I understand the supply and demand effect I think. It‚Äôs how the store of value proposition holds up in an ever expanding market with new alternative stores of value being created all the time. More reading required I think

[12/21/2021 3:54 AM] rturner20#0130
Random question.... For ERGO to get big there needs to be volume. For there to be volume there needs to be coin available to be traded.   I have been mining ERGO for awhile now with a rather large setup and im holding until it goes ballistic. I see the future of ERGO and its revolutionary. But I also see how few miners there are out there and how it will take longer to mine the coin than it will take to implement all of the projects built on ERGO. Do you run into the issue of not enough coin to use in the projects or does everything just kind of work its self out?  Thoughts?


[12/21/2021 9:29 AM] andee#4722
Emission stays the same with a nethash of 1TH or 1000TH, there might be some early miners that sit on a large amount of the current supply but there are plenty coins in circulation. There is an upcoming proposal for extending the emission to make mining income more predictable for a longer period of time. What do you mean by not enough coins to use in projects?


[12/21/2021 9:33 AM] andee#4722
But the chain is not lacking miners, if we go by the current ~14.5TH nethash and say that a GPU on average hashes 100MH (which might be higher than the average) that's 145000 GPU's


[12/21/2021 3:12 PM] rturner20#0130
@andee It looks we are about 30% of the way through mining the total amount of ERGO.  Can we feasibly have a large stable environment with alot of projects running on it when we wont eveen hit 50% mined until next year at the earliest the way things are going right now.  Its not worth mining at todays prices, Im just holding like I have been for a couple years now.  ETH has over 3 million rigs running and we have about 250 thousand rigs.  Right now our diff is too high for where we are at in my opinion. If none of these coin go to market due to price we as a collective are not winning.   How mind you even at 5 bucks I still have 4GH collecting coin and im selling until its way over 100 a coin.


[12/21/2021 3:19 PM] andee#4722
Currently its right above 49% mined. But I don't see why amount mined would be a limiting factor? Ethereum has no cap, how would you apply the same logic there? Price has to increase for mining to be profitable over time, but what if you flip the coin there. If emission was adjusted to go even faster, what would make it profitable after there is no more left?


[12/21/2021 4:20 PM] Holden#1501
I was wondering the same. If ERG can be BTC 2.0 then some random coin in the future can be ERG 2.0 then what's the point. The supply will keep increasing.


[12/21/2021 4:35 PM] andee#4722
Ecosystem and usage. There are tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies, but not many offer anything unique. They are mostly forks from other projects with some variables changed


[12/21/2021 4:37 PM] andee#4722
What is the point of anything at all? üòÑ


[12/21/2021 4:40 PM] Welly#3430
Yes, that was my point. I think you‚Äôve worded it a lot better though. There are of course other things I love about erg, and I‚Äôm bullish in the mid to long term, but I just wonder about the store of value proposition in general when new alternatives spring up so often.


[12/21/2021 5:23 PM] andee#4722
Store of value depends on how the ecosystem grows of course. Any cryptocurrency with a limited supply that has a great ecosystem with lots of use cases and users can be considered one. But if you distill all cryptocurrencies there aren't too many that have a self developed chain with something unique to offer

I know we've got secure PoW chain, with resistance to 51% attacks among other benefits. I was reading the whitepaper and looking thru here, I haven't seen any info on the topic for a while: Are there any current plans to implement some sort of security against high computational power such as quantum computers? There are already things like XMSS which are considered very quantum resistant. I know we may not see any "quantum attacks" on any coins for a several years still, but ERGO is all about the long term.

So here's a thought I had since I was aware of the Rent mechanism Ergo has. I was watching an interview between Tim Ferris and Balaji Srinivasan, at one point the conversation shifted how governments may take on chains or they become their own type of Nation/State, without borders. Could the rent mechanism could be generalized in some sort of "Citizenship" NFT for access to the perks of said Nation/State for X amount of time, basically a form of tax.  I don't know the level of these perks at this time, but say it gives you access to a living space and other basic commodities. It's a thought, but the idea of building out your own community with some type of perks in this manner really has my brain moving and super excited for the future.

Even if all pools charged payout fees it would be very small since they batch transactions. In one recent payout from nanopool they had 99 payouts in one transaction that they paid a fee of 0.002ERG for.  ~0.00002ERG per miner


[12/28/2021 8:56 PM] andee#4722

I am involved with running an IT services business. We are experts in system administration & IT operations, and we are researching the best areas where we could provide value to the ecosystem in a sustainable/profitable way.

We are happy to invest, and are initially going to be dedicating a full time system administrator and some of our hosted infrastructure & network resources up front. And invest further based on how we go.

Obviously there is investing in mining. And we have some rough ideas on other areas we could get involved in, but interested in other people's thoughts as to where we could possible help / be of assistance to the community?

NFT as a singular piece makes no sense other than it‚Äôs the latest craze for people to not understand but profit from. Where NFT is a shining light in the dark is rights management for collaborative projects no media distribution tracking via blockchain vs. third party media monopolies guiding the way things go


[01/05/2022 5:56 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Example: audio sample licensing. Single one shot as an NFT, with royalties management built into the sample use case.


[01/05/2022 5:56 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Example: video game assets from third party dev companies going to a larger overall project / distribution

[01/05/2022 5:57 PM] liquid_phase#4605
There is literally no purpose for people to do single case NFTs other than that it‚Äôs a craze like Pok√©mon cards for no other reason than the fact that people have a vain understanding of what NFT and blockchain re actually good at doing

Agree! NFTs in its current form makes no sense to me and for that reason I avoid it like the plague. 
I DO understand how NFTs can work for ingame items, event tickets etc. I DO believe it has a purpose and will eventually find it's place and be a big "thing".

However, buying a gif/jpg as NFT....adds no value whatsoever. But each to their own I guess, if people want to spend money on these jpgs and become bagholders, who am I to knock it.

To me it sounds like money laundering üôÇ


[01/06/2022 7:17 PM] zackbeaven#2321
Strongly agree with you  @liquid_phase I think things like ticket sales to try and stop scalpers will be a big use case. 
I do however plan on buying a peice of art out of curiosity, not willing to spend more than 1 or 2 ergo worth. And it not be a crappy character. There seems to be fairly little real art out there

I hear a lot of coding languages mentioned. Which is used where? Such as Java, scala, ergo script, rust. ?


[01/07/2022 6:23 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Guessing node is Java/scala


[01/07/2022 6:24 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Ergo script is the smart contract on top of the block chain?


[01/07/2022 6:25 PM] glasgowm#9381
ergoscript is a scripting language based on scala


[01/07/2022 6:26 PM] glasgowm#9381
http://docs.ergoplatform.org/dev/stack/back-end/

Users of AppKit will usually write Scala code (although AppKit supports many other languages). HDF users will need to write Rust code, allowing it to be used across platforms. (The HDF also provides some additional abstractions on top of the original ergo API). JDE users will have to write JSON.

Why, instead of creating a re-emission schedule, isn't the emission rate just soften to the point the the emission curve is extended up to the same network height that is aimed  by EIP-27?


[01/11/2022 10:41 PM] glasgowm#9381
You original contract is immutable - this is just a secondary one on-top


[01/11/2022 10:45 PM] blackinsecure#3693
which contract?


[01/11/2022 10:46 PM] glasgowm#9381
emission contract


[01/11/2022 10:47 PM] blackinsecure#3693
I'm sorry I don't know more of this stuff, but I'm not following


[01/11/2022 10:49 PM] glasgowm#9381
The original emission is distributed through a smart-contract. It can't be softened or changed - the soft-fork deploys a second smart-contract with a new emission rate ontop of the previous one.


[01/11/2022 11:00 PM] blackinsecure#3693
Maybe then I didn't understand the Proposal properly and EIP-27 already does what I was thinking it should be done


[01/11/2022 11:01 PM] blackinsecure#3693
Does the re-emitted coins comeback to circulation gradually or every 4 years like the graph in ergo.watch suggests?


[01/11/2022 11:05 PM] glasgowm#9381
From the miners perspective it'll hit 3ERG in 2027 and then just continue steadily


[01/11/2022 11:05 PM] glasgowm#9381
It's split into four years on the chart because of the storage rent period I imagine but doesn't mean anything

This is more of an ADA tool to get Ergo in return.  I dont use it, but seems like you need to be staking ADA in an ADA pool.  Then you would link that pool to this one and get Erg in return.  However, Im not sure if its completed as it says something about payouts happening in phase 3.

i envision it as more of a defined percentage of any novel utilization of NFT assets - where a tx fee is a set fee on all actions on the network


[01/20/2022 9:20 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i suppose the use case i see benefitting the most from this, and vice versa ergo from it, is with music distribution and audio sample distribution licensing, as well as visual media assets used in larger scale production such as nft game assets, but i dont yet see how that can form a microeconomy as firmly as music and art can

When solo mining, is the block height reserved to the machine once it starts mining the block? For instance, If i was to start solo mining block height 672000, wether it was an actual block or not, would that mean no other miners or pools could touch that block height?


[01/26/2022 7:11 AM] apexpool#3878
no, all miners compete for the exact block height.


[01/26/2022 12:36 PM] liquid_phase#4605
So a slower miner would never find a block then, because the same@block would always be mined faster by someone with more hash power.. right?


[01/26/2022 12:38 PM] apexpool#3878
almost never. miracles happen from time to time.


[01/26/2022 12:40 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Okay thanks for the info. I find this logical, compared to people on reddit saying they are finding solo blocks under 10% effort with less than 500 mh/s. I think theres disinformation campaigns on reddit to manipulate miners


[01/27/2022 3:59 PM] dusek#6153
Hi, I wanted to ask, when a token is sent, why is there a small amount of erg (around 0.001) always associated with it? Is it to pay storage rent in the future?


[01/27/2022 4:09 PM] glasgowm#9381
it's the transaction fee - added to the block reward


[01/27/2022 4:18 PM] Telefragged#8068
Isn't there a minimum erg requirement per utxo? So when sending a token you also have to send a small amount of ERG - in addition to the tx fee - that sits in the same box as the token


[01/27/2022 4:45 PM] dusek#6153
I'm referring to this. So this is the transaction fee?

Just curious and may be a q more related to marketing channel, but why do I feel there are rarely any news sites that cover ergo or mention it, ever. Could there be any submissions made or interviews given like of updates and advancements made on the ergo platform to get higher media coverage that have the huge reading base, or am I naive and in reality is it just not a high enough market cap yet to garner attention, despite the tech and fundamentals..


[01/27/2022 10:43 PM] XX_BlueFire_XX#3457
Hello I wanted to ask a couple questions. I've been mining for some time now; however, I've been looking into getting more technical into the blockchain space.
1. I'm a bit overwhelmed by the learning curve that I need to overcome before I started developing for any platform, including ergo, and I'm curious where to start?
2. I've been reading through the white paper and I get a general sense of what the Autolykos concences does; however, I'm having trouble understanding all the variables involved and how the protocol differs from others? Additionally, it's important to note that I'm a novice when it come to cryptographic hash, so any resources there would be appreciated! Thank you!


[01/28/2022 9:17 AM] glasgowm#9381
News sites where? The scene is clouded with easy money who spend a sizeable chunk on PRs/paying influencers/etc. Most of the stuff you're seeing is probably paid advertising I'd imagine. But Ergo does get picked up organically occasionally. But yes, mostly developers at this stage and no 'news' for the gen. pop.

we also push out to PR networks
https://cryptonews.com/news/ergo-a-new-layer-defi-solution-celebrates-two-years-of-mainn-10876.htm

and then also do larger PRs on the tier1 sites (bloomberg,yahoo,nasdaq,etc) for big updates

What are your aims? What would you like to do? cryptography is a hard place to start without any dev experience heh, and I doubt many devs working on ergo have picked apart the autolykos variables.  I'd start here and then maybe watch the Appkit by example video or do some ergoscripts by example.

If you have no coding experience at all maybe a python course on https://www.sololearn.com/ would be best but it depends on how you learn best. Maybe a book and youtube course is more your style.

Agreed it likely is mostly paid or sponsored in some manner for other chains to get mentioned more or take more priority, thank you for the links , I suppose patience is key!

 I just found it baffling the limited amount of coverage seen lately in relation to what is happening with improvements and updates.. and don't get me wrong the team are making leaps and bounds on connecting with the community be it on here, on YT videos, reddit etc I guess I wanted to see more of it appearing on non ergo specific sites, aggregators of crypto news and the likes.

Good things are kept in the dark/illegal until bad people understand them enough to profit from them

I have been in the legal cannabis industry in the USA since its inception. I see many parallels in the blooming crypto ‚Äòindustry‚Äô. Just calling it like i see it


[01/28/2022 3:13 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Also, though. As someone with a background in marketing, the ergo foundation could use some help in this regard with their community updates - though i do feel like they are doing a superb job of advertising within the crypto community, not alot of conversions will come to ergo from outside existing crypto spaces simply because the fundamentals of crypto which ergo is best at is not at all widely understood or adopted by masses, so when someone tells them erg is better than eth there is no frame of reference why. There is a fundamental disconnect with most people who dont understand blockchain technology, think its a singular blockchain all the crypto is on, think its like stocks, etc.
IMHO, some really pretty infographics explaining network bloat, transaction types, airdrops, nft, ergoscript, etc - would be beneficial and widely shared. Video media is finicky and people hve short attention spans and want quickly digestible bits of information to help them make an informed decision, or a decision to continue down a rabbit hole on a certain product or technology.


[01/28/2022 3:16 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Turn the features of ergo versus failures of other crypto into memes, like the funny hitler video i saw on reddit comparing eth2 to erg - hilareous, accurate, with high shareability factor even though its video media

Marketing is walking a line between catering to the lowest common denominator, and selling someone a great product they dont know they need/want. Because of the general nature of ergo being superior it means we are the minority and closer to convincing people we have a good product they want or need, which is substantially harder as an marketing tactic than catering to the lowest common denominator(proven psychological triggers)


[01/28/2022 3:20 PM] liquid_phase#4605
It will be up to the ergo foundation and their direction, and manifesto, how they continue to drive marketing. Its my opinion that there should be a bit of dumbing down to some of the concepts to make them more digestible - explain the technology to a 5 or 80 year old and then make it sound pretty and not condescending and more people will be likely to nod their heads in understanding . Theres a way to do this right, and many ways to do the marketing wrong and i believe where much of the crypto industry is right now is because of the wrong direction for marketing,, catering to the lowest common denominator of the financial tech industry which is stock traders and collectors

[01/28/2022 3:26 PM] liquid_phase#4605
I would reccomend to ergo that every time a community update happens in video or a ergo foundation meeting occurs, someone is in the meeting taking key points, key performance indicators, and any important blurbs, and then hire someone on fiverr to turn the data into really pretty infographics  containing the information, which should then be included in the blog posts, video posts and posted to social media.


[01/28/2022 3:28 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Turning education into a marketing campaign can also be a good strategy, such as employing the fact that crypto barrier to entry is high, the ergo marketing could in fact be teaching, hand holding, onboarding onto the platform utilizing the lack of current consumer understanding as an asset


[01/28/2022 3:30 PM] liquid_phase#4605
It could come across more as ‚Äòthe peoples crypto‚Äô in this manner as well as boost adoption rates

So I really enjoy interfacing with hardware and would ideally want find ways to make mining more efficient / work on some sort of way to get ergo payments to companies for products / services. Sort of like a paypal. Those are two thoughts that I've had. So read the docs and look at the Appkit example / ergoscript by example. I assume that stuff can all be found in the docs / git hub?
So I'm fluent in Java and I have a brief understanding of Python. I'm attempting to learn C once some books come in the mail from a friend of mine. Definitely have a lot to learn as I majored in aerospace engineering and not CS lol. Though I love CS and everything I've done has been self taught, so I think it's feasible to educate myself.

I see. I guess my only choice is ASIC miner


[01/30/2022 3:50 PM] liquid_phase#4605
ergo is really efficient compared to other algorithms, less wattage and heat on the video card.

my radeon rx590 has been a beast little miner 24/7 for months without any issues when i switchd it back to windows.

as far as i know, ergo is actually asic resistant and is better mined on standard workstation/gaming GPUs\


[01/30/2022 5:42 PM] hellyea#2223
Yeah I know thats why I am planning to mine KDA since it will mine faster and sell KDA for Ergo haha


[01/30/2022 5:43 PM] hellyea#2223
I will look up to buy rx590


[01/30/2022 5:43 PM] hellyea#2223
So even low quality gpu can also mine Ergo?


[01/30/2022 5:45 PM] liquid_phase#4605
the rx570 and 580 are better than the 590 frm what i understand, im able to get between 60-64 mh/s on erg out of mine depending on the OC settings. i think people are even getting decent hashrates out of the rx 4xx series. i had the rx590 from before mining (gaming) and so did not buy it for mining, but since i got mine its gone way up in price because its a decent mining card


[01/31/2022 2:53 AM] DonatxAK47#7038
all rx 470 480 570 580 590 will be actually the same 64 mhs if you target 110W per card. 4gb is more than enough


[01/31/2022 2:56 AM] DonatxAK47#7038
1190 / 920 / 1900mem. If possible, lower volts. Mining bios is needed, unless you get 45 mhs. samsung hynix elpida all perfect, if they have proper timings. GLHF!


[01/31/2022 2:57 AM] DonatxAK47#7038

[01/31/2022 7:11 PM] liquid_phase#4605
@glasgowm in response to your reddit poll, in my opinion Ergo needs to take a step back with their marketing and ask yourselves "what is our story, what is the story we want to tell people, and what story are we currently telling them?"

right now, it will be very easy for ergo to follow in the footsteps of other crypto going down the wrong road for brand image. to be associated with money, i see as a negative. to be associated with a platform, system, service, community - thats better for standard people. only money-makers will want advertising catered to money, and ergo seems like it wants to be the crypto for the peoples empowerment of their own financial systems and setting their own value - but its right alongside a bunch of stock monkeys who just want to see arrows rise. 

tread carefully in these times, because they are pivotal


[01/31/2022 7:22 PM] glasgowm#9381
Thanks for the feedback! We're in the midst of doing that too as part of a wider rebranding - but need something in the short-term for the new website launch soon and those concepts are a bit harder to make coherent to the masses in a catchy sentence.

I got a few dozen 470/480 4gb mining ergo for months now. Unfortunately didn't sell any ergo and payed for power out of pocket. At current prices and electricity (~0.16$/kWh) it barely gets even $1.8 profit per month per card according to whattomine calculator. Considering ~100W/rig idle power, and miner/pool fees, it might be even making a slight loss, not sure. How would I justify keeping the gpus ? What would you do ? diversify altcoin portfolio (like mine ETC for a while), sell gpus, stop mining, or continue mining hoping prices get better ?

I‚Äôd recommend doing what you think is best. Atm you‚Äôll be mining more coins for less profit but if you hold and ergos price does shoot up the gains will be huge, if prices don‚Äôt recover at all you‚Äôll have wasted some money on it. Eth miners have also struggled with this in the past but the holders who kept mining made some serious cash last year

Will NiPoPoW client allow the same level of interactions with Ergo blockchain? (create, submit transactions, mint tokens, get balance,  etc) ? or will it still require a full node setup

[02/04/2022 5:25 PM] 6directions#1089
regarding ergo addresses...
as I understand it, you can generate new addresses like in cardano.
but in cardano all addresses are "tied" or "related" by the stake address.
so I can have assets across n+1 utxos, but if I enter any of the n+1 addresses in an explorer, the explorer is able to gather information of assets across all my "boxes" bc of the stake address relationship.

is there an equivalent concept in Ergo?
I've noticed I can have, for example, NFTs in different boxes, and if I go to a site like ergonfts.org, the site will ONLY show the NFTs under the given address

If i purchase ADA on changelly do i need to send it to an ada wallet before sending to kukoin or can i send it directly to my kukoin account wallet from changelly ?

A question pertaining to all blockchains/wallets. Since a recovery phrase is just 12-24 randomly generated words is there anything that would stop a hacker from running a program that generates 12-24 Radom words and just running that till they found a wallet with sizable funds to steal? I‚Äôve noticed when using my seed phrase to recover my wallets on new devices that I can create a new spending password without knowing the one that was previously used on the other device. Is it possible to create a password that doesn‚Äôt reset when importing your seed phrase to another device?


[02/05/2022 9:17 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Yes, you can use a mneumonic password, which ensures that someone must know both the mneumonic and the mneumonic password in order to restore your wallet.

on cardano they have nft-maker https://landingpage-pro.nft-maker.io/pro , with all kind of feature such as mass minting , on-demand minting, and vending machine style sales.. their vision is "MAKING NFTs ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE" By taking away the complexity of Cardano Development they aim to make NFT development as easy as possible. .. so i believe ergo also capable to do so in the future since ergo and cardano share the same model

will we have this kind of project/feature soon on ergo?

It is a bare bones app that parses the $erg blockchain and pulls historical price action. With enough community interest I can make improvements to it.

where are this NFT stored? and i mean not the NFT itself (that goes on the wallet) but the NFT data, wich will be a mp3 music + a cover photo, can this be taken down, deleted or censored in any way? thank you very much for your time

Reading all these Ergo whitepapers makes me realize how dumb I am üòÇ. I'm constantly having to re-read stuff...and there's sooo much documentation! 

Ok, the way I understand it- and please correct me if I'm wrong- is that the way the transactions are set up to have thousands of inputs that it pretty much solves the transaction speed issue. Solana leading the pack with 65,000 tps would be a thing of the past then? If Ergo can support mass transactions like this, would it eventually become the best platform for games and metaverses that require a ton of tx?

I don't think that are "major" challenges when it comes to Ergo, is just a problem of time.

New to ergo and wondering what DeFi options there currently are. Looking for something relatively low risk that might generate a little revenue rather than simply leaving my ergo in a wallet. Thanks for any advice and pointers.


[02/14/2022 6:51 AM] root7Z#8699
In ErgoDEX, there are ERG/SigUSD and ERG/SigRSV pairs if you know how impermanent loss works. Also SigRSV is the reserve token of SigUSD protocol so it's a way of locking your ERGs on stable coin protocol but you should further check the protocol on what are its revenue streams and downside risks. Currently there is no lending so I wouldn't say there is a low risk investment here. You can check the pairs on ErgoDEX https://app.ergodex.io/pool?active=positions-overview

Thank you.  Curious if devices and infrastructure for the company/foundation are secured? Hypothetical, but what if one of the team members is phished? Are there controls in place? Is there are security framework  being followed? If someone knows the answer, you can message me privately.


[02/24/2022 11:06 PM] abashai#9101
Unrelated question, about privacy/regulation.  Forgive my ignorance. I believe I heard Charles Hoskinson say that Cardano was being built with regulation and privacy in mind and there would be functionality that could be switched on/off. Is ERGO building something similar? What are the foundation's thoughts on regulation? If governments were to say, only cryptos with XYZ are permitted to be traded on CEXs and used in business, does that hinder ERGO in any way?


[02/24/2022 11:19 PM] abashai#9101

Foundation is secured by a multi-sig wallet. Needs multiple parties to sign


[02/24/2022 11:40 PM] glasgowm#9381
Ergo has optional privacy enabled on the application level. It's separate from the EF/'Ergo' so not a major concern.

Sorry if this is a dumb question but what do Hot wallets do with your seed phrase when you recover a wallet using them? Wouldn't your seed phrase then be stored by that hot wallet making it vulnerable for a data breach?

Hey guys, since we have seen how Metamask banned Venezulian users for not using the wallet can this be experience with Yoroi, Nautlius wallets too?


[03/04/2022 10:23 PM] SoCool#6419
Community wallets can do whatever their devs want.

They're open source though. One can always fork and strip out any pieces they don't like. Given the Ergo community culture I also doubt any wallet will ever go closed source - or a closed source one would be adopted.


[03/04/2022 10:25 PM] SoCool#6419
Nautilus makes a new version which bans users that look like jacked up mice men and you could just use the old version or edit it out to block people who are so cool instead for your own version.

So I was researching Radix, I don't even know what this means, can someone explain me in simple terms what Radix trying to achieve? (Was shilling Ergo to a friend but he prefers Radix) here is what he gave me for Radix, 

Their novel DLT architecture vs blockchain for example would be like comparing a single thread cpu vs a multi-threaded cpu. 

Transactions are parallelized and can occur independently of other shards across the network whereas blockchains process txs per block.

It's just next level DLT.

Does it kinda compete with Ergo in some way?


[03/12/2022 11:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
It's basically a different type of eUTXO with built in sharding. Ergo can implement a variety of scaling solutions as needed. Built that way as there was no clear winner and being adaptable ensures it's longevity.

i've been hearing people call Ergo the 'chainlink' of cardano where chainlink is for eth.

can anyone refute or back that up? or where is that opinion coming from, simply because of the team behind ergo was working on chainlink?


[03/14/2022 3:05 PM] glasgowm#9381
most people don't even know what an oracle is but the fact that ergo can do them and chainlink had a pump in recent history leads to that narrative.

Hi, I am new to Ergo Platform and new to mining! 
QQ:
1) I've seen most mining using Windows or Hive OS( from this linkhttps://www.reddit.com/r/erg_miners/comments/nno576/ergo_mining_stats_spreadsheet/).  Can I use Ubuntu + GTX 1060 6G instead?  Is it doable?  
2) Is there any documentation or site where it can show me how to perform the appropriate settings?  
Many thanks!

First time im hearing of the NCA


[03/17/2022 2:02 AM] liquid_phase#4605
First time using ergodex, connected a liquid test wallet i restored from a phone into Nautilus wallet, with a few erg in it and attempted to buy some Neta - looks like i got the neta but for some reason all the erg and tokens were transferred out of my phone wallet and into another address that nautilus generated


[03/17/2022 2:03 AM] liquid_phase#4605
should note, i only used a portion of my erg in the wallet to buy Neta, but yet all my erg and tokens unrelated to the ergodex transfer are now dissapeared from my phone - but showing in nautilus

regtest is a testnet but there's no private version for ergo afaik - think you just need to run your own one

So I heard somewhere that an ergo smart contract isn't turing complete over a single block but is over a multitude of blocks . Maybe I'm misremembering, but if I'm not, how does this work? How would the language be turing complete over multiple blocks but not a single? Any docs I can read on this?

I sent some assets to a node wallet, but the node never properly sync'd up...

i then used the seed phrase the node wallet provided to try to restore the node wallet to nautilus, but it restored the wrong address and no assets. I then tried adding alternative addresses, hoping it would find a derived address that was correct, but that maxed out at 20 and now i am lost


[03/30/2022 10:51 PM] liquid_phase#4605
The tx shows on explorer, the box shows the assets i sent, and the tx i sent them is has 1400 confirms


[03/31/2022 2:26 PM] SoCool#6419
Try recovering the mnemonic in the mobile wallet on iOS or Android - they use identical library for creating the address from the mnemonic as does the node; if that works, I would send everything to the nautilus wallet as that derivation for addresses had a slight recent change due to an incompatibility found between the Java (node and mobile apps) mnemonic to address derivation and the standard derivation used in web wallets (nautilus, yoroi, safew)


[03/31/2022 2:27 PM] SoCool#6419
You *may* be running into that, or you may not. Restoring on mobile ergo wallet should result in identical behaviour to the node wallet though - then you can just do a send of all the items easily from that wallet to a new one where the mnemonic behaviour is standard


[03/31/2022 2:41 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i did try restoring on mobile wallet (iOS) to no avail. it restored the same incorrect address with no assets.. im now wondering if i wrote down the mnemonic incorrectly but just trying to wonder how that could happen


[03/31/2022 2:43 PM] liquid_phase#4605
thankfully its only 1/3 of an erg... but one day thats going to be worth about a million so..... haha üòâ


[03/31/2022 2:43 PM] SoCool#6419
How old was the node?


[03/31/2022 2:43 PM] liquid_phase#4605
it was a fresh download from github


[03/31/2022 2:43 PM] SoCool#6419
Yeah at 1/3 erg maybe forget about it üòÑ hah


[03/31/2022 2:44 PM] liquid_phase#4605
^it also had some token assets i sent along with it, which i could afford to lose, but still i dont like the thought of losing access to a wallet


[03/31/2022 2:44 PM] SoCool#6419
You likely wrote it down wrong, maybe print it next time if possible üôÇ


[03/31/2022 2:44 PM] SoCool#6419
(this may be bad advice, I don't know why printing something wouldn't be good but I also don't know best practices with security of this stuff)


[03/31/2022 2:45 PM] liquid_phase#4605
technically a printer has its own local memory which could be compromised, among many other methods of compromising data while it moves through software to get to a printer


[03/31/2022 2:45 PM] glasgowm#9381
I don't think it maxes out at 20 does it? Not on mobile anyway


[03/31/2022 2:45 PM] glasgowm#9381
Sometimes people need to generate lots more


[03/31/2022 2:45 PM] liquid_phase#4605
@glasgowm it does on nautilus


[03/31/2022 2:46 PM] liquid_phase#4605
@glasgowm good to know! ill try to restore on mobile ane then keep adding derived addys


[03/31/2022 2:51 PM] liquid_phase#4605
100 derived addresses in, still no luck


[03/31/2022 2:52 PM] liquid_phase#4605
oh well. atleast i was smart enough to test transfer to the node first


[03/31/2022 2:53 PM] SoCool#6419
@liquid_phase Can you use the node to send the funds to another wallet? There may be value in providing the mnemonic to a dev to see about reproduction, but you would want to empty your goods first for your own security. It's *possible* but unlikely there's an issue with that particular mnemonic.


[03/31/2022 2:54 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i cannot as the node never properly syncs. it stops around block 600,000 causing my mac to memory leak


[03/31/2022 2:54 PM] SoCool#6419
Maybe working with a dev to resolve *that* issue is worthwhile. I know there's myriad java CLI switches that often resolve such from reports


[03/31/2022 2:54 PM] glasgowm#9381
Have you tried adding

```
network {
          maxConnections = 10
        }
```


[03/31/2022 2:54 PM] glasgowm#9381
but the mobile wallet should be the same as the node...


[03/31/2022 2:55 PM] liquid_phase#4605
with only 1/3 an erg in the wallet i'd be happy to provide the mnemonic to troubleshoot, though i doubt they have any tools which can help me - as its probably a case of me writing down the second word in the third position, or something user error


[03/31/2022 2:55 PM] glasgowm#9381

[03/31/2022 2:56 PM] SoCool#6419
Well they could at least verify that for you by attempting mnemonic derivation in a node on their own then


[03/31/2022 2:56 PM] SoCool#6419
If you know the precise node version you used, having someone else reproduce with that node version could ensure there's no issue with the mnemonic derivation - and would validate the hypothesis that you just wrote it down wrong


[03/31/2022 2:57 PM] SoCool#6419
If however someone reproduces the same issue then there's something to be chased down


[03/31/2022 2:57 PM] liquid_phase#4605
its ergo node ergo-4.0.24


[03/31/2022 2:58 PM] liquid_phase#4605
if someone has the time and is happy to help, id willingly provide the mnemonic and they could keep the assets in the wallet, if there is a glitch with the node it should be known - but i also think this isnt worth people's time really as its just a simple wallet issue


[03/31/2022 3:01 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i tried various solutions to get the node working but to no avail. i tried the other flags you sent me before too, never had any luck

Anyone have experience with setting up an LLC in the United States in particular Wyoming? Wondering if I can have a LLC in Wyoming, with my mining rig in another state?  Please any advice or personal experience you liked to share, thank you.


[04/01/2022 10:17 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Not financial or business advice: your business can be incorporated in any state and you can have cap-x equipment (your rig) in any location, but you need to file local paperwork if you plan on doing business in the boundaries of that state, such as if you were to sell goods to members of the state when your business was formed out of state. If you were subsequently claiming expenses on the business taxes for service costs, if they were service providers in a different state than business registration that might get testy with the buerocrats... up to a certain amount of revenue / tax claims i'd say you'd be okay but past that point you might raise some red flags just from an automated system perspective


[04/01/2022 10:19 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Delaware has cheap incorporation fees, but  you should also research other states, such as Nevada

i used the swagger interface to run a check on the seed phrase if it matched the wallet, and it came up false
So looks like i either wrote it down improperly, or this is the wrong seed for this node üò¶

It was originally supposed to be a bridge with Gravity - then they fell out with Waves. Then they were going to use Wormhole/SOL - but SOL was hacked. The new plan was to use ETH/FTM - but progress slow and updates lacking

Hey guyz, when we say ergo does not have gas fees, does it means its free to run a smart contract (free processing power)?

Nope, it has transaction fees

I'm thinking about how etherscan allows users to read the code from smart contracts.

[04/17/2022 2:54 PM] liquid_phase#4605
You go to the /swagger interface once the node has started. Swagger is the interface of crypto tools built into the node. Use BLAKE2B to create a APIkey hash out of a value YOU DEFINE. meaning if you want your node password to be 12345, you need to use Blake tool to convert 12345 into the hash, which you then put the hash into the conf file and restart the node

Quick question... I just transferd from yoroi to nautilus.. Should it provide me with a new seed phrase or the orignial one remains?


[04/19/2022 5:38 AM] theodork#3746
When you say you "transfered", did you send your assets or did you restore your wallet into Nautilus?

If you restored your wallet using your previously generated seed phrase, then continue to use that one. If you created a new wallet to send yourself assets, you would've been given a new phrase. In that case, use that one.

I have a question for any experienced miners out there mining the autolykos algo for some time now. I cannot find much information on people using 8gb variants of RX cards for this Algo. I know it is very core dependent, and does not rely on memory as much, so is it just an unknown rule to not mine with these 8gb cards? Should i just rely on using the 4gb cards instead? To anyone that has any insight i would very much appreciate it!

I have read about consolidating UTXOs to improve Yoroi reponsivity. 2 questions: 

1) If I send all to the same/a new address in the wallet, aren't all those previous transactions still present to slow things down?
2) At what number of UTXOs do people typically begin to see Yoroi issues? I only have 94, wouldn't have thought that to be significant.

1. Is there any company behind the ERG (Ergo) project or is it managed by the decentralized community? In first case - what's the name of the company? 
2. Is it possible to find any info about the project team? I didn't find any info regarding them on your website.

Hi everyone! I am looking to set up a node and I'm following the instructions here: https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Set-up-a-full-node.  I am at the "Initialize Wallet" step. When I add the API key (from the previous step), I get "Bad API Key" as an error. What could be causing this issue?

I am using Ergo 4.0.26.


[04/30/2022 1:49 PM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
It should be the phrase you wrote in the swagger api not the hash value


[04/30/2022 1:49 PM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
So for example if it was hello you write hello as the api key

we are looking into porting our Solidity based Game https://FishFight.one to ergo and have begun prototyping an attempt to have mutable data by having a root-nft and n-child-nft which point to our root-nft, where the children will be burned in order to be changed‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs becoming increasingly complex and I‚Äôm curious if there was any advice for how we might accomplish this‚Ä¶ perhaps using registers or reminting the Root-Nft each time instead. 

for reference, our game has a list of values which are mutable per FISH and our contract are the only method of altering our FISH data!

is there a better place to ask this? Was hoping to explore this for a hackathon but need some guidance on the token architecture.

From a non-ergoscript perspective on the rights management of a piece of data, once minted getting a token ID  is essentially the same as getting a Universal product code when distributing other media on legacy platforms - and as such other creators in the rights management space (myself included) are creating solutions to work with NFT based content and rights management utilizing token ID and minting ID as 'universal product identifiers' - since they are really the only thing proving when and who minted an original.

If your goals are to keep the NFT identifier content internal for use in game, then i see no problem creating arrays and heirarchies and nested layer-2 data for organizing NFTs - but if the intent is to distribute the NFTs to users to hold and they will subsequently have some form of re-minting technology built into them i think that is not really a feasible or realistic solution for a token that's going to be a store of value or a store of rarity for users to collect.

thank you very much!  seems like some kind of parent /child relationship is the way, just wanting to figure out as simple an option, where as the game is played over time a doesn‚Äôt become a big mess of searching for child nfts. I think we‚Äôre on the right track but Ive been starting to get ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs got to be a smarter way to do this‚Ä¶‚Äù vibe 

Our issue is that we have a set of core data which doesn‚Äôt change and an array of data which often changes‚Ä¶


[05/09/2022 3:55 PM] liquid_phase#4605
^is it possible to use UI/web backend to add identifying prefix or suffix to the NFT identifier?

Perhaps current game state could be minted regularly but i‚Äôm not wanting to keep things off-chain if that‚Äôs what you mean‚Ä¶ ‚ùî‚ùî
I was also curious if ergoscripts could help‚Ä¶


[05/09/2022 3:57 PM] liquid_phase#4605
in theory, using web you could nest .yaml or json data with heirarchies using all independent objects


[05/09/2022 3:58 PM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
I tried but still waiting on any response


[05/09/2022 4:00 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i have proposed this idea before to night-owl, but a yaml / json file content is hierarchical text data linking to other objects or arrays - in this case, there could be a 'parent' index of NFT identifiers and their relationships stored in json/yaml data - and then every time the relationships change its reminting the yaml/json file because its where the relational data has changed


[05/09/2022 4:01 PM] liquid_phase#4605
each nft would remain its own object and retain its minting/tx id. but the yaml/json data file calling and arranging them on your front end would be re-minted as a new index everytime it would be changed


[05/09/2022 4:04 PM] liquid_phase#4605
```
token_id: erj89ref4f8h48gh348hg48
parent_of: 333j3j3ijfrijgirjgir
child_of: 999vrjr9jr9jgr

token_id: 00005595u9595u95j5j
parent_of: none
child_of: none
```
something like this


[05/09/2022 4:06 PM] liquid_phase#4605
then, if it changed...:
```
token_id: erj89ref4f8h48gh348hg48
parent_of: 00005595u9595u95j5j
child_of: none

token_id: 00005595u9595u95j5j
parent_of: none
child_of: erj89ref4f8h48gh348hg48
```

the token ID's are the same, but the relational data in a single file has changed - and so reminting is more simple than doing each object independently of a parent index


[05/09/2022 6:35 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
So what exactly are you trying to do here? You have some root NFT, and a child NFT, and the child NFTs must be burned to modify some data tied to the root NFT?


[05/09/2022 7:06 PM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
I am honestly trying to figure out how we might mirror what we've built with Solidity (on Harmony), where we have several mutable values on our NFT and several contract interactions where those values can be mutated on chain... 

We want to deploy a new fishing location on Ergo and hoping to mirror all that we've already built or we might have to limit it to start and build it up over time


[05/09/2022 7:09 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Its certainly possible, just has to be done in a different way. I suppose you could have a box tied to a single NFT with a contract that takes different token ids and performs changes to the data held in the box's registers. The NFT in the box would be your "root NFT", and the other tokens would represent different classes of mutable changes that could be applied to the box holding the root NFT.
Every time the root NFT box is spent with another box holding one of the tokens, it outputs a new root NFT box with the applied changes set in its registers.

Okay, so here is this 'fun' (for some definitions of fun) NFT idea I had. It doesn't have a strict utility (though more on that later), yet it might gives ideas to others.

The main pitch could be: NFTs that let holders "decide" on their rarity.

I think you should care more about how to prove the correctness of excuting logic with your nft off-chain on ergo chain rather than how to implement the logic as in evm. a excuting bot may be needed in your situation to conduct those global state change.

for those root nft box, it seems global state and you can tied them to the child nft by address or p2s or p2sh address consisting of consuming condition logic, if the root nft will not be changed and many child nft will rely on it, you can set them as data input utxo.

[05/10/2022 8:52 PM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
An aspect of my goal of porting was actually to create a pathway for other EVM projects to be able to see how it could be done (as an effort to grow Ergo), but I think you're correct... 
Which is why I cam here, Might need to rework the concept to utilize boxes and smart contract interactions to be somewhat completely different than our current concept.

We're looking for a trustworthy developer (unless I can hear back from @weskinner :prayge: ) to help us look into this for FishFight, ideally for this ErgoHack...

May need to derive new addresses or restoring in nautilus/mobile might be easier


[05/13/2022 12:34 PM] sicran19#5895
Ok I'll try to restore in mobile


[05/13/2022 2:45 PM] sicran19#5895
Restoring it on my mobile (using the mnemonic) gave me a totally new primary address with 0 funds üòë


[05/13/2022 2:46 PM] glasgowm#9381
@MrStahlfelge what should be tried if that mismatch bug is in effect? Nautilus?


[05/13/2022 2:47 PM] sicran19#5895
I'll try that too in a few mins


[05/13/2022 2:51 PM] sicran19#5895
Nautilus restored with the same address as the mobile version


[05/13/2022 2:55 PM] glasgowm#9381
Try deriving additional addresses on the mobile wallet incase it pops up


[05/13/2022 2:56 PM] glasgowm#9381
otherwise paste the full error, maybe rescan / derive via swagger


[05/13/2022 2:56 PM] sicran19#5895
I've rescanned.. Took a while..


[05/13/2022 2:57 PM] sicran19#5895
Would derive generate a new address? And do you think it's possible to get the address that holds that change?


[05/13/2022 3:03 PM] glasgowm#9381
you can have multiple derived addresses in one wallet - and yes


[05/13/2022 3:06 PM] sicran19#5895
DerivationPath m/1/2 .... Got me 2 addresses and they're both the same


[05/13/2022 3:07 PM] sicran19#5895
Could be a bug in the panel showing the same address twice..


[05/13/2022 3:14 PM] sicran19#5895
Ok managed to use that extra change - -


[05/13/2022 3:16 PM] sicran19#5895

[05/14/2022 9:58 AM] Strupf#5194
Buy XLM or any other low fee transaction coin, send to Kucoin (no kyc), swap to USDT and then to ERG. That's how I do it

Hi, I use the Ergo wallet on iOS. Does it have an expiration date (do I have to withdraw my ERG) ?


[05/15/2022 3:19 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Not just iOS.. any ergo wallet is subject to storage rent. This is not an expiry date.
over a very long period of time, if you do not ever move the erg , it will slowly be siphoned back into the ecosystem (storage rent). When i say a long time, i mean a very long time - and its not an amount that at this point in time is worrisome - it's just a network defense mechanism to ensure that no ergo can ever be completely locked away into the system and never retrieved

[05/15/2022 3:20 PM] liquid_phase#4605
here is some text directly from the ergo blog:
```
If a box does not have a transaction for four years and it still has something in it, it is subject to storage rent. Storage rent allows miners to spend a box (providing it is older than the storage rent period), enabling them to collect a fee for storing this box over four years. The fee depends on the size of the box in bytes. Most boxes are small and it costs them only ~0.14 ERG and a transaction fee. Paying storage rent allows boxes to remain on the blockchain for longer than four years and ensures the long-term circulation of ERG.Let's put this in perspective. If you had 1 ERG in your box, it would take 32 years from your last transaction for a miner to claim the contents of your box. If a box is not used over that period of time, storage rent reclaims its value for the blockchain.
```

depends on if you care about KYC going INTO crypto. i've found that the easiest and fastest way to get ERG in my wallet is to buy Algo with my coinbase account using bank debit card, sending that Algo to Kucoin trading account, transfer Algo to USDT, and then Buy Erg with USDT and withdraw to an erg wallet... whole process takes less than 10 minutes generall

Kucoin and Coinex are often the top two recommendations. I use and like Kucoin, very low withdrawal fee (0.01ERG vs 0.1ERG on Coinex).

hi i want to build a new gaming computer, do specs matter for mining ERG with high end GPUs or is there like a hashrate limit? I'd like to mine ERG and XMR simultaneously ideally but not sure what specs would be ideal. I also want to do competitive gaming with it also, in full hd 144hz for UE5 engine, and also level design. im already in crypto but never had hardware aimed at mining. I wouldn't want to waste electricity or something because of an oversight, any tips appreciated


[05/19/2022 1:10 PM] Meta#5132
erg mining is mostly about vram speed? or does the graphic processing matter too. im curious about playing while mining maybe

By legit I mean it works and isn't a phishing site or a scam. Beyond that idc lol


[05/22/2022 5:48 PM] liquid_phase#4605
yeah, exactly. It just so happened that my identity / credit card info was "stolen" shortly after using Simplex via kucoin (they ask for ALOT of identifying information just to use a debit card to purchase) You would think that something that big wasnt a scam, but you never know in crypto simply because the market is fairly unregulated. also, for posterity sake, it is completely possible (though unlikely in my eyes) that someone got my data through other means - i just find the timing coincidental


[05/22/2022 5:52 PM] liquid_phase#4605
It should be noted that this doesnt even have to be attributed to the maliciousness of the company doing the payment processing.

Because crypto is so unregulated and hard to work with banks and payment processing, it's not exactly Visa-scale companies that are doing things converting fiat to crypto.

So, human error and systems error are big faults to consider too. in 2021 more people had their identity stolen than ever before by orders of magnitude. Because covid put people out of work, because boredom, because working from home had less security but everyone still needed to 'do their jobs'

Even if someone at the company didnt steal the info, it got leaked somehow, somewhere - and its my fault at the end of the day for putting that info into a payment processor i wasn't sure of.


[05/22/2022 7:47 PM] mr--sabotage#8093
I'll probably.create a dummy wallet and test it with a couple ergo and see if anything happens then go fro.there. thanks for the information

with NIPoPoW is there any issue with lose of data during compression


[05/23/2022 10:42 AM] glasgowm#9381
There's no data compressed (like you'd think traditionally) but is a 'compressed' version of the chain for certain uses  - it's a hash-based data structure (skip-list) that includes the header of each block allowing verification of a subset instead of consecutive blocks.


[05/23/2022 12:41 PM] Teltook#0841
Random question: does a portion of erg used in normal transactions also get 'burnt' into the reserve or only when interacting with the protocol? (I.e. the 2.5% fee)


[05/23/2022 12:42 PM] Teltook#0841
And will this 'burnt' reserve be used to pay miners after erg mining ends? Thanks


[05/23/2022 12:44 PM] Teltook#0841
My thought process was, if the reserves wallet doesn't remain active for 4 years it will start paying miners right?


[05/23/2022 12:44 PM] glasgowm#9381
ERG can't be burned, assume you're referencing the sigmausd fee which is internal to the protocol and put back in the reserve


[05/23/2022 12:44 PM] Teltook#0841
Yea


[05/23/2022 12:45 PM] glasgowm#9381
yeah it's just put into the reserve to slowly build up the reserve-ratio and help offset profits people take.


[05/23/2022 12:45 PM] glasgowm#9381
Also helps prevent front-running


[05/23/2022 12:46 PM] Teltook#0841
Okay, thanks. So if Alice sends Bob 1 erg, the fee is only used to send the transaction. No portion of this fee goes into the protocols reserve unless Alice or Bob decide to later interact with it (the sigmausd protocol)?


[05/23/2022 12:53 PM] glasgowm#9381
yeah it's the sigmausd reserve not related to the erg blockchain - just ontop of it.

I think I am understanding the sigmaprotocol a lot more now. So the advantage for 'HODLers' is that you won't be affected by the 4-year decay if you hold a position in the reserve, and also can't be liquidated in a black swan event right?


[05/23/2022 1:35 PM] glasgowm#9381
Holding a positioning in the reserve just means you get SigRSV in a box still subject to storage rent. No liquidations but the value can still decrease to 0

Hi all, where can I find a more conclusive discussion on Ergo's scaling abilities?
In particular, I'm wondering if there is a limit on transaction size and/or block size?

I want to build a dapp but I want to understand Ergo's limitations first.


[05/23/2022 9:36 PM] glasgowm#9381
4.0.23 has tx size limit of 96 kb by default for the mempool, larger ones need to be included manually by the miner. block cost limit and block size limit are set by miner voting. Currently at 8MB I believe

Ok, yes I see that we limited to 96 which is wayyyyy less than the 400kb of this transaction.

Would this transaction have to have been broken down to 4 different transactions or how could this particular use case be worked on?


[05/23/2022 11:07 PM] glasgowm#9381
Would need to be broken down or you'd have to convince a pool to include it manually (or argue for the limit to be raised)

Why are so many mining algorithms built for GPUs? Why aren't more chains doing CPU mining? Aren't CPUs even more widely available? Or is CPU hashrate more prone to centralisation? Not really into the details of mining, just wondering


[05/26/2022 12:02 AM] liquid_phase#4605
I am not an expert but my layman's understanding of it is that a gpu can distribute a workload where a CPU is based on 1 at a time instruction sets spread out over multiple cores

Why the Erg price is going down?  Why would you sell here? Miners are clear not profitable anymore because the electricity prices, so if they do sell they sell in a loss (I for one i stopped mining), those who bought above 2$ are clear in a loss .. so who is selling? The people who got in at 0.30$ ? Or the price is manipulated by algos on exchanges ? Is 0.30$ the bottom if not ? üßê

[05/27/2022 9:40 AM] Strupf#5194
It's because people assume to buy in lower. I don't know, it's just psychology - BTC will go down so everything else will go down, too, so might as well try to get a lower buy-in.


[05/27/2022 9:41 AM] Strupf#5194
I bought all the way from $16 and I sold plenty of times at a loss to get back in lower

IPFS has lots of network congestion and not the best scaling solutions implemented yet. Currently services like cloudflare are offering IPFS object caching for eth based nfts as a service for profit model - indicating there is also room there in the Erg space to create the same or a similar model

[05/30/2022 7:44 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Also, as IPFS is distributed and not a classic 'server' its is likely not serving any sort of mimetype in the header of the file as it serves it... the end result being, if there is no server side configuration to recognize it - it won't play back through web players, which recognize it as raw data and not stream data. It may very well be that if you went directly to the audio file on IPFS, it would play or downloads to your computer and play, but through a streaming player would have issues


[05/30/2022 8:04 PM] gnuion#3794
Is The Internet Computer (ICP) any good? They already have a decentralized TikTok called CanCan.


[05/30/2022 8:05 PM] gnuion#3794
And they already utilize wasm which is loved among many developers.


[05/30/2022 8:08 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i have no clue i have not researched their platform.

if it is a layer 2 ontop of ethereum id probably stay away from it myself


[05/30/2022 8:48 PM] gnuion#3794
It is the opposite.  It is an ETH killer.


[05/30/2022 8:55 PM] gnuion#3794
Basically instead of mining rigs you need expensive servers to host dApps and you get paid ICP tokens for doing so. It is quite new and I am just a junior developer so still a lot to learn. But the concepts and ideas I find really interesting.


[05/30/2022 8:56 PM] liquid_phase#4605
I just did a brief read up through some of their docs.
While not thorough by any means i have some takeaway thoughts.
1) super cool that they are interoperable with bitcoin (isn't ergo basically capable of the same thing with all the background tech?)
2) they run on nodes specifically at datacenters hosted by private parties, and althoguh those private parties are all different it doesnt take much of a look around the corner to know that large players have most of the financial sway at datacenters nationwide/worldwide. Claims of decentralization, but seems to be a POS network operated by corporate actors - though with some dope dev behind it. I'll keep my eyes on it and see where it goes, but i don't see anything there that ergo can't do


[05/30/2022 8:57 PM] gnuion#3794
yep, it is not perfect. But at least they won't need something like aws  or google cloud because they have their own solution built in.


[05/30/2022 8:57 PM] liquid_phase#4605
^ i think flux is the same thing no?


[05/30/2022 8:57 PM] liquid_phase#4605

hi guys, does ERG have an infinity supply of coins? or ERG supply is elastic ? or does it have a max supply and the new coin can only be generated through mining?


[05/31/2022 12:59 AM] liquid_phase#4605
erg has a max supply, and coins can only be mined

max supply and other stats can be found at the top of ergo explorer:
https://explorer.ergoplatform.com

Note that coinMartketCap has the wrong circulating supply and ergo has submitted tickets with them to fix it to match the current amount. CoinGecko has the correct circulating supply number i believe as do other coin checkers


[05/31/2022 1:00 AM] liquid_phase#4605
ERG supply is somewhat flexible over other types of limited supply coins, in that there is the notion of Storage rent. Every 4 years, if there are no transactions for a specific box, a small deduction of erg will be taken from that box for 'rent' to go back to the miners


[05/31/2022 1:01 AM] liquid_phase#4605
https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2022-02-18-ergo-explainer-storage-rent/


[05/31/2022 1:06 AM] liquid_phase#4605
Ergo is also more energy efficient than other PoW mineable coins, using a memory hard/asic resistant algorithm which can be mined on legacy every day hardware, any video card with 3gb or more of memory can participate in mining ergo, making it a friendly option for everyday users.

Ergo is also a more performant scripting language than other major players in the space (eth, btc) and so you can do very versatile things with it. Currently, the highest amount of outputs (wallets sent to) in a single chained transaction (one transaction can span multiple blocks, in this case 3) on ergo is 53 thousand. 53 thousand different wallets on ergo received an NFT drop over the course of 6 minutes (average block time on ergo is 2 minutes) from one sender

[05/31/2022 10:11 AM] Teltook#0841
Hola,
I asked a question about the sigmausd protocol regarding rent fees. But can't find anything about it.

My question is:
1) If Alice owns sigRSV and doesn't touch her sigRSV for 4 years. Will Alice's sigRSV be used to pay miners rent fees after 4 years?
(edit: I found my answer here: https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2022-02-18-ergo-explainer-storage-rent/)
It seems that Alice will need to pay ~0.14 erg after 4 years of inactivity

2) Hypothetically, Alice doesn't own ~0.14 erg. Only sigRSV in her box. How will storage rent be calculated?
It seems that if Alice doesn't own ERG, she will lose all of her sigRSV (and any other tokens) if she is unable to pay the fee, e.g. 0.14erg

3) Also, is the storage rent iterated every 4 year interval or every-day after the 4-years?
~Can't find anything on this.


[05/31/2022 10:19 AM] Teltook#0841
Another question:
What is the formula for storage rent calculation as a function of memory used?

[05/31/2022 3:28 PM] VertErgo#5544
On a side note, when will Node version updates become more stable (ie. become less frequent)?  I keep up to date with versions (currently on 4.0.31) but from the outside it may look like ERG is still highly developmental.  In the future, I suspect node updates will be scrutinized to a much greater extent.

I just saw a comment on reddit suggesting the yoroi ergo wallet is no longer officially supported - is there any concern for the ergo I've been hodling and stacking in a yoroi wallet?

[06/11/2022 6:24 PM] indigo#5500
I have a bunch of 1 erg that I received over time from mining pools. This means when I try to send a large amount of my wallet balance, there is a huge amount of transactions (122). It's still in the "submit" phase of yoroi send. Do I just let it keep cranking or is this a lost cause? Sometimes with Monero I end up having to do this from the cli

[06/11/2022 11:04 PM] indigo#5500

[06/11/2022 11:30 PM] glasgowm#9381
Full node will work fine for too, never to restore your wallet during the sync or rescan if you add after

[06/13/2022 8:45 PM] Equinox#5557
2 days ago, I tried to file in a transaction on ErgoDex and it failed systemically ("Please try again later.") to transfer my ERGs to Paideia. Told myself, "It's fine, I'll wait a bit." Yesterday and this morning my ERGs also fully showed up in Nautilus (after waiting for it to sync). Fast-forward to now, because I was going to file in a new trade with my ERGs, and I see they've been transferred from 2 days ago. My wallet shows the transaction was passed (and the Paideia tokens of the appropriate amount) 2 days ago.
It's not really a problem, but more of an information request. Is that something that's supposed to happen? I never got a confirmation on ErgoDex, 2 days ago, that any of my failed transactions worked, and I'm just a little surprised because... that wasn't there yesterday and now it is, but if it had come into my wallet shouldn't it have appeared about 2 days ago? Again I'm troubleshooting and also truly curious as to what happened with my wallet.

Hey all, what‚Äôs the average block height increase speed of Ergo? I‚Äôm looking for this information to create a contract that will use this as ‚Äútime‚Äù (for example, after X amount of blocks release some tokens).


[06/15/2022 5:46 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
It's on average 2 minutes per block. In smart contracts, you can also access the exact time (in milliseconds since unix epoch) that the block was created if you want something that is more accurate.

Feel free to ask any questions here or in the respective channels; there is no easy yield at the moment. All have risk; LP on the dex are probably the safest bet and should earn dex tokens in future to sweeten the deal (I believe they're also planning on rewarding them retroactively for those LPing now)

There will be a tier 1 exchange listing right around the corner depending only from their side now. Since ergo has it's own chain, its more difficult for exchanges to implement it compared to ERC-20 tokens.

Is there any actual stress test study on SigUSD publicly available? @glasgowm @Armeanio


[06/17/2022 6:17 AM] Armeanio#0321
You can read the djed paper. 

https://ergo.watch/ is a community resource. 

The assumption of failure is pretty simple, well kind of... 

reserve ratio is 1 erg to X.XX% now

 SigUSD can potentially depeg if ergo price is 1/X.XXth from current price...

If no one mints sigrsv, BUT there is an incentive to mint sigrsv as the price falls so we get into game theory.

[06/18/2022 6:52 AM] Armeanio#0321
I don't think a decentralized stablecoin should exist outside of an ecosystem. That's an unpopular opinion in the space 

External pairs take market making. 
That's not decentralized at all.

I see no benefit in taking on external risks beyond the protocol itself. 

SigUSD within the ecosystem has relatively clear assumptions. 

Many other stablecoins want to replace usdt and compete with usdt directly. This imo is quite a bad idea.


[06/18/2022 6:56 AM] Armeanio#0321
I think we have seen some nice stress tests in our history personally. Bearwhale on v1. Adapted the protocol, has been pretty stable despite volatility.

It is not really the brain child of Ergo tbh, we tested it for IOG and Emurgo.


[06/18/2022 7:18 AM] blackinsecure#3693
Once the token is pegged to something that is outside the system, it already "exists outside of the ecosystem". It's unavoidable by definition.

Also, stress testing the protocol is not the same as advocating for 1:1 collateral model in a centralised dollar account. It's just analysing the protocol to see under which conditions it's most likely to fail. Basic risk management.

the pool holds on to your earnings until you choose to withdraw/get paid out

I was wondering two things : 
1- is there any platform where we can do co-mining ( like comining . io ) 
I'm with a bunch of friend with a couple GH/s and we would like to "SOLO mine" but all together , so more like private ERGO pool

2- If that doesn't exist, it there any way to "own" your own pool , with PPLNS reward / payouts and all as on open source project ? 

Or do you have any work around that can work ?

Thanks a lot

[06/23/2022 8:16 AM] Strupf#5194
No, unless someone decides that it is profitable for him to build some. Ergo is designed to be only mineable by general purpose GPUs, so you had to put a general minimal computer with GPUs into a black box.


[06/23/2022 12:06 PM] Meta#5132
i'm not asking for asic miners. im saying it would be cool to have something like raspberry pi that is designed to mine for erg and secure the network that way using the current consensus


[06/23/2022 12:13 PM] Meta#5132
some device that would be setup out of the box and would work flawlessly.  eventually the point of allowing only regular gpus is so it doesnt become a money and hardware race. but let's face it. gpu mining is destroying the supply chain of the gaming industry because of greedy miners that buy gpus just to mine and abuse the system for their own gains. this new device would put everyone on an equal foothold and hashrate, prevent hardware arms race, be more efficient on energy usage, and cheaper than a full setup. win on the consensus front, win on the supply chain front, win on the security front (hackers would have to go after erg specifically to find exploits rather than be subject to gpu mining exploits in general), etc, etc... and it would help decentralize the network further if people dont have to buy expensive hardware to stand a chance or sacrifice the hardware they need for gaming to mine instead.


[06/23/2022 12:16 PM] Meta#5132
ofc there needs to be a lengthy transition period for it to become the only way to mine erg, for a while it would work in parallel to regular GPUs. but GPUs keep getting more powerful, and they're centralized under 1 or 2 companies. Really not optimal for long term consensus security. specific hardware fixes that in the long run and makes it harder to abuse the system.


[06/23/2022 12:16 PM] Meta#5132
and its manufacturing could be funded on chain directly, to belong to everyone in the network. more utility for ERG


[06/23/2022 2:50 PM] Strupf#5194
You're 100% describing ASICs tbh. No utility other than mining Erg. That's even more wasteful than a GPU. Would also need to change the mining algo, otherwise it's always cheaper and better to get the raw hardware instead of buying it from a 4th party.


[06/23/2022 2:52 PM] Strupf#5194
There was a general global chip shortage at the same time of a pandemic where everyone sat their asses at home, and also at the same time RTX 3000 released, also a crypto boom. I wouldn't blame it on the miners.


[06/23/2022 2:52 PM] Strupf#5194
GPU availability is great nowadays


[06/23/2022 2:53 PM] Strupf#5194
And who would get themselves a device not usable for anything except for some mining, other than Ergo enthusiasts and - guess what - big mining corporations, which leads to centralisation


[06/23/2022 2:53 PM] Strupf#5194
my 0.02$


[06/23/2022 4:59 PM] Meta#5132
you don't get it. it's not about hashrate if it's done right. it's about securing consensus.


[06/23/2022 4:59 PM] Meta#5132
and great for miners, but personally i cant afford to upgrade my gaming rig.


[06/23/2022 5:00 PM] Meta#5132
so why do you use chip shortage as a pro pow argument? i just did the opposite xD


[06/23/2022 5:00 PM] Meta#5132
there are ways to prevent stacking multiple devices on the same network.


[06/23/2022 5:02 PM] Meta#5132
in fact hashrate is detrimental to real decentralization because it encourages you to one up others in a never ending arms race


[06/23/2022 5:03 PM] Meta#5132
the goal is that everyone runs one node, pow was just early attempt at making it work with hardware that's already out there, but we moved passed this now


[06/23/2022 5:05 PM] Meta#5132
the assumption was every has one pc, so one gpu. now you got miners that buy GPUs in bulk, gamers that can't afford market price anymore, and lots of miners willing to get specific hardware, and the space moving towards more energy efficiency. if you know about hosting server companies, they dont run screens and all because it wastes energy. well guess what, running windows or linux wastes energy too. we can reconcile the idea of asic with real decentralization, cheaper prices, more energy efficiency, and anti abuse consensus decentralization


[06/23/2022 5:06 PM] Meta#5132
it would be largely possible to get miners out for like 40 bucks each


[06/23/2022 5:07 PM] Meta#5132
all that while retaining the same pow consensus model at its root


[06/23/2022 7:31 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
I know many Gamers will not upgrade their GPU but they have no problem spending $50-100 a month on game subscriptions or in game items. They also have no problem spending a few hundred dollars a month on junk food, soda and drugs.


[06/23/2022 7:31 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
So while they say they can't afford a new GPU, they can, they just choose to spend and waste money on other things, they want everything as cheap as possible. During the pandemic was an unusual time so prices were simply exacerbated by the chip shortage, and high demand because of eth profitability. The thing that sets GPU's apart from asic's is that that arent application specific. They are multiple purpose and not just used for gaming but also rendering, multiple screen displays, better video quality on a pc etc.


[06/23/2022 7:32 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
The gamers for some odd reason are anti making money, many are anti work and they want everything for free. one thing you have to remember is that mining is most profitable only during bull runs, during the other times it wasn't very profitable to mine if you have a lot of overhead. So it's a lot easier for a game r to simply mine a coin and if he gets enough each month to pay for his WOW subscription, like me when I started would be happy. But they don't think like that, for some reason they have this need to refuse an opportunity which is basically over the long term a way to pay for their gaming, I don't know why some can't see this.


[06/23/2022 7:32 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
Last year I bought a gaming PC for $1500 with a 3060ti in it. Over the last year it paid for itself and my gaming. Now I have a free and clear gaming PC and I can mine some coins for fun to cover gaming costs.

i dont do junk food, i got two months late credit, i upgrade my gaming computer only when necessary, except this time around because its unaffordable. not everyone can afford to put a month and a half in a new computer, but let me guess, youre from the usa where medium salary is like 2000usd a month with inflation

[06/23/2022 7:38 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
There are cpu minable coins, but to expect a company to build something for $40 is kinda unrealistic unless you are mining a cpu coin with an phone


[06/23/2022 7:41 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
In fact you can mine Dero on a $50 used android phone, that's the closest your going to get to $40 is a used phone and cpu minable coin


[06/23/2022 7:43 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
And you don't need a new gpu to mine ergo, I started with a 1650

It's amazing to me that at it's peak, World Of Warcraft had over 5 million monthly users, the users are still there playing other games. Thats 5 million potential gpus that can be mining an algorithm that's not, and for why... no other reason than to be against something


[06/23/2022 7:53 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
The equipment is already out there, there is no need to build something else


[06/23/2022 7:58 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
And many of them are paying subscription each month and for in game items, doesn't it make sense for if you are paying for this stuff anyway... instead of having to pay out of pocket you can just let your gpu run when you're not using it? It seems so simple... I don't get it


[06/23/2022 8:00 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
A smart pool that pays out in video game subscription cards instead of coins, seems like a no brainer I'm not sure why any gamer would be against it

EIP27 keeps rewards going until 2045, after that network utilization should be high enough that the storage rent and tx fees will theoretically all sustain miners

getblok and enigmapool are both community run projects

how much hashrate do you have


[06/28/2022 4:30 AM] liquid_phase#4605
solo mining is best done by large rigs/farms


[06/28/2022 4:30 AM] liquid_phase#4605
pool mining more consistent payouts for smaller rigs

you should definitely do pool considering the low hash rate

how i do that?

[06/28/2022 4:33 AM] liquid_phase#4605
you said solo


[06/28/2022 4:33 AM] liquid_phase#4605
so just connect to their non-solo pool

try getblok its a better pool and better to support community


[06/28/2022 4:34 AM] liquid_phase#4605
larger hash rate doesnt neccesarily mean its a better pool


[06/28/2022 4:34 AM] liquid_phase#4605
but it does mean something, as super low hash rate pools wont find blocks as often


[06/28/2022 4:35 AM] Exotik#7467
hmm

will try set in getblok pool

memory clock more important than core clock for autolykos


[06/28/2022 4:57 AM] Exotik#7467
just a silly question... what about i try mining ETH with 1660 and ERGO with 1050? is possible to mining 2 crypt at once?


[06/28/2022 5:19 AM] VADER#9139
yes you can but the dag size for erg is 2.5gigs so you likely wont have enough mem for ergo or prety much anything else on the 1050


[06/28/2022 3:04 PM] Exotik#7467
i think i can, cause 1050 have 4Gb... but idk, i need study more about crypt to see if worth or i just "burning" my money


[06/28/2022 7:57 PM] VADER#9139
@Exotik then yes you can mime erg with the 1050. Personally I mine over buying.

[06/28/2022 11:58 PM] Filsommer#8173
Hi guys, is it possible to get a history of prices from an oracle?
I can only see the last on in the explorer: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/oracle-pool-state/ergusd


[06/29/2022 12:22 AM] liquid_phase#4605
web 3 is an abstract concept describing the interrelation of layer 1 and layer 2 blockchain operations mixed with classical company architecture and decentralized company architectures.

Yes, Erg can do things 'web 3' - but maybe you should broaden your understanding of what is possible with web 3 to understand the best use cases for various coins on various networks.


[06/29/2022 12:24 AM] MinerCrusader#9217
Thanks for the answer


[06/29/2022 12:24 AM] liquid_phase#4605
most people would probably think NFTs = web3. if that is the description, then yes Erg is very good at web 3.

Ergo is a proof of work chain given value by the people across the world who mine it and then build on the network


[06/29/2022 1:53 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Ergo is not related to eth, btc, ada, or any other chain - it is its own entity


[06/29/2022 2:04 PM] DaP3z#3742
I know this discord will probably be a little bias but whats your thoughts on the potential of flux and a alephium compared to ergo?


[06/29/2022 2:18 PM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Alephium is interesting Casue of there proof of less work. Though it‚Äôs a core heavy algo using Blake 3


[06/29/2022 2:24 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
I like flux's idea to reward node operator's. However I don't like the idea of locking up tokens to receive a reward and I don't think a block reward should be split 50% to nodes and 50% to miners, although something is better than nothing.


[06/29/2022 2:29 PM] Murr#9913
is the flux really locked up? You can take it out at any time without penalty


[06/29/2022 2:30 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
I watched Ergo Prisms interview (which was good) with the guy from flux, and to be honest the impression I got was... "where not here to talk shit about other projects"... then proceeds to talk shit about other projects... It seems like they say all the things you want to hear, which is why I'm skeptical


[06/29/2022 2:30 PM] Murr#9913
the only thing i don't like about flux is their cringey marketing campaign


[06/29/2022 2:34 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
It remains in your wallet but you're not able to use it until the lockup period has expired, you need to maintain it as collateral.


[06/29/2022 2:35 PM] Murr#9913
there is no lock up period, if you delete the node the funds become available


[06/29/2022 2:36 PM] Murr#9913
I have 5 cumulus nodes currently


[06/29/2022 2:37 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
So you don't need to maintain the flux in your wallet as collateral?


[06/29/2022 2:37 PM] Murr#9913
you do as long as you are running the node


[06/29/2022 2:38 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
So, as long as you are running a node it's essentially locked up.


[06/29/2022 2:38 PM] Murr#9913
correct


[06/29/2022 2:38 PM] Murr#9913
so in that sense it's kind of a pryamid scheme lol


[06/29/2022 2:38 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
I thought they had like a few month to a year lock up period, I guess not


[06/29/2022 2:39 PM] Murr#9913
that is going to be for the new nodes that only require like 5 flux


[06/29/2022 2:39 PM] 0xMNITY#6979

Question, so i have a business partner who is looking to deploy his employee and other business contracts as nfts or on the block chain. How would i go about doing that on erg or is that not possible?


[06/30/2022 11:58 AM] glasgowm#9381
There is https://github.com/sigmastamp but would probably need a bit of work to do what you want. He could sell the NFT via escrow and have that transaction count as proof? but IANAL)

@MrStahlfelge any ideas?


[06/30/2022 12:18 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
needs some more information. the contracts should be added as a picture in an nft and should be normal-language contracts and not smart contracts?


[06/30/2022 12:23 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yes normal language contracts, I guess a transaction is all you'd need to prove it lawfully. (or at least rationally). Maybe use one of those transaction purchase messages? üòõ


[06/30/2022 12:24 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
problem I see is to proof that the minting address really is the employer


[06/30/2022 12:25 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
but these are not ergo specific problems, so the answer to @VADER is yes, minting an NFT and sending it is possible


[06/30/2022 12:25 PM] glasgowm#9381
the NFT could include QR code to a verification tweet maybe?


[06/30/2022 1:53 PM] liquid_phase#4605
This is another use case for indexer NFTs. a smart contract itself acts as the employment contract which holds tokens which represent works, services or things. In this case i would probably do the written contract as markdown/yaml and then place it inside a smart contract where it's waiting for the signatures of the two parties in the form of image NFTs, once the smart contract receives the images from the people referenced in it's creation, it locks into a 'vested agreement'


[06/30/2022 1:54 PM] liquid_phase#4605
but now you're getting into some really complicated contractual law stuff.  We are working on a smart contract similar to this at swamp audio

[06/30/2022 4:21 PM] nitram147#5106
Depends on what do author want to achieve. SigmaStamp is currently running it's offchain service only on testnet so it wouldn't be viable to use at the moment.


[06/30/2022 4:22 PM] nitram147#5106
Once I complete InERGitance (currently working on the offchain bots for "holiday protection" purpose), I will also update the sigmastamp and make it working without requirement for a backend (currently it uses the concept of proxy smartcontracts, because it was developed in times where there wasn't any dApp connectpr).


[06/30/2022 4:23 PM] nitram147#5106
Maybe I will keep the support for proxy smartcontract but their completion (the work which is currently being done by the "ergo-assembler" service) should be done on the frontend so we don't need to run any backend üôÇ


[06/30/2022 4:25 PM] nitram147#5106
However current priority is to complete InERGitance and then to complete my hw/sw solution for shamir backup which's hw could be used as an opensource/openhardware hardware wallet for Ergo (but there's tons of work to be done) üôÇ


[06/30/2022 4:25 PM] nitram147#5106
So I don't have any ETA for the SigmaStamp updates yet.


[06/30/2022 4:26 PM] nitram147#5106
And to be honest I would like to wait till the ergoscript compilation will be implemented in the `ergo-lib-wasm` library so the proxy contracts solution can be completely trustless.


[06/30/2022 4:27 PM] nitram147#5106

What you're looking for is possible using smart contracts but its a custom use case which hasnt been made yet, so it would be up to you or someone to make it a reality.

Can't get sigma USD now because reserves are low? If erg continues to head lower what will happen to the peg?


[07/01/2022 8:13 PM] liquid_phase#4605
you can get sigmaUSD via ergodex, you just cant mint any new sigmausd while the reserve ratio is below 400


[07/01/2022 8:14 PM] liquid_phase#4605
sigmaRSV holders assume risk by providing liquidity to sigmaUSD


[07/01/2022 8:14 PM] liquid_phase#4605
the ratio exists to provide incentivization towards rewards on reserve holding when the market recovers

Wish this were easier. Trying to move my stuff from other ecos didn't realize swapping for a stable would be so buggy


[07/01/2022 9:37 PM] liquid_phase#4605
its not buggy, you chose to swap a stable during voltatile market conditions for the stability-saving ratio (it is doing its job properly) if you have purchassed sigUSD via ergodex and you would not have had an issue, but since you tried to mint some when the market conditions were moving alot it got stuck. 

it might sitll go through, it might refund itself, it might need to wait a minute and then you try again because the specific node for sigmausd might be down or having an issue with a block. The nodes are independent run from ergo blockchain and so sometimes they go down, there stilll need to be better solutions made to scale node failure mitigation solutions - but ergo is still early and this doesnt exist yet.


[07/01/2022 9:39 PM] liquid_phase#4605
this is how an algorithmic stablecoin functions. it stays safe by keeping a reserve ratio. if you interact with sigUSD treasury while it's maintaining it's ratio, it might reject to send you any SigUSD. thats why the refund thing is there


[07/01/2022 9:40 PM] liquid_phase#4605
People tend to have more luck with success on tokenjay than with sigmaUSD.io  not sure why, but they seem to.


[07/01/2022 9:41 PM] SBR#0001
I didn't realize minting sigUSD was such a nuanced thing. So ergodex it is

Ok. Fees I'm ok with


[07/01/2022 9:44 PM] liquid_phase#4605
keep in mind due to fluctuating reserve ratio that sigUSD will fluctuate slightly in your wallet. ive seen it at 100 dollars as low as 95 and as high as 105, so there can be market conditions where because of the treasury not being able to mint new stable, that the demand is higher, causing higher price on ergodex, and show price increase/decrease on wallets using the api


[07/01/2022 9:45 PM] liquid_phase#4605
algorithmic stable is slightly different than most people are used to


[07/01/2022 9:45 PM] liquid_phase#4605

this might sounds dumb but i cant find a straight answer online.
is running a node rewarding in anyway just like on flux?

No, it's not


[07/08/2022 7:03 PM] nitram147#5106
(I don't know about "flux", first time I hear that term, but no, running of your own node did not provide any reward for you, except from good feeling üòâ )

Kinda disappointed to see that providing liquidity to a "trusted" 3rd party for a market maker % is more important to the Foundation than adding security to the chain and receiving % of block rewards.

Miners and the community are supposed to trust the Foundation that they aren't being traded against by 3rd parties yet the Foundation isn't even mining with them. hmmm


[07/08/2022 9:07 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
Cryptocurrency organizations are supposed to help digital currencies to reach their full potential while allowing the cryptocurrencies to exist independently. They achieve this by providing support in terms of development, research, education, and marketing without directly benefiting from the cryptocurrency but instead rely on donations.


[07/08/2022 9:08 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
Providing security is supporting development. Hash power is a donation, market making isn't.


[07/08/2022 9:09 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
I don't have any thing else to say on the matter. I said what I needed to.

What does the ERGO platform bring to the world? Basically, why mine it or own it? Is it just another "alt coin", or does it serve a real world purpose?

a pro life tip i learned too late is that you never trust when it comes to business (anywhere money flows freely) - everything exists as either an asset, or a liability. You can only assume based on a number of factors that things will go as advertised - for all else, thats why certain laws, audits and international standards exist when it comes to traditional finance (and other industries). This doesn't mean to be a jaded person who turns away all vendors - it just means to set the expectations at the beginning of the discourse.

Which is why when I found out about funding the market making, I stopped mining and I no longer support the project.


[07/09/2022 7:09 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
"They achieve this by providing support in terms of development, research, education, and marketing without directly benefiting from the cryptocurrency but instead rely on donations."


[07/09/2022 7:10 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
That specifically excludes funding market making and profiting from it.


[07/09/2022 7:22 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
Funding development for example could be providing a mining software which has a 1% hash donation that goes to the foundation. There are a few software's available for miners to chose already and if they chose to support the Foundation they could easily do so by donating hashrate by using said software. I see nothing wrong with that since they are contributing to development and accepting hash rate as a donation from anyone who freely chooses to use said software, not a requirement but a choice. So there is other options that could have been employed to generate funds instead of funding market making for a cut of the profits.


[07/09/2022 7:22 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
Best of luck.

What exchange do you use for buying and selling ERG?


[07/10/2022 3:24 PM] VertErgo#5544
I use either kucoin or coinex.  Both allow for anonymous buying...  I move my erg to private wallets after buying

Of course it is, the algorithm speaks for itself and doesn't need propped up. Liquidity on exchanges does.

[07/12/2022 4:56 PM] blackinsecure#3693
way too low to be consistently mining blocks solo


[07/12/2022 4:56 PM] liquid_phase#4605
ive literally never even heard of FTX


[07/12/2022 4:56 PM] blackinsecure#3693
by volume it's actually bigger than Coinbase


[07/12/2022 4:57 PM] blackinsecure#3693
but just like Binance, it's mostly outside of the US


[07/12/2022 4:58 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i prefer crypto[dot]com to coinbase, as their debit card is a legitimate prepaid card that you must convert crypto to fiat before loading. Coinbase's card only allows you to assign a specific coin/stable to the card as the payment method, meaning your amount could fluctuate (i had UST as my payment method on coinbase and then luna crashed and burned, so even though it wasn't alot of money, it destroyed my payment card lol) - not adequate for using crypto in every day situations with coinbase card versus the other one being much more reliable


[07/12/2022 5:00 PM] blackinsecure#3693
Your analysis is very fair. I only point out that it's US centric. And that's why Binance and FTX are bigger, because they're global. And that's why people here cry so much to be listed in one of those.


[07/12/2022 5:01 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i understand that - i suppose that im also seeing a big global exchange listing as potentially doing as much short term harm as good


[07/12/2022 5:01 PM] blackinsecure#3693
Kucoin is good and global, but much lower volume


[07/12/2022 5:02 PM] liquid_phase#4605
erg can suddenly be arbitraged by a bunch of new bots? i can only see the value of erg plummiting in the short term  -  but im not an expert at such thoughts

I sent ERG from my Ergo mobile wallet app to Kucoin (just trying out). It takes around 25 minutes. Is it a normal transaction time ? Because when i sent from kucoin to ergo wallet, it went faster than this.

Will it get faster in the future with more miner coming to the space?


[07/12/2022 6:04 PM] liquid_phase#4605
kucoin requires 10 confirmations ontop of the initial transaction completion


[07/12/2022 6:04 PM] liquid_phase#4605
every time i have ever deposited into kucoin it always takes between 10 and 30 minutes


[07/12/2022 6:08 PM] blackinsecure#3693
yeah, this sounds like a Kucoin thing instead of a network thing. If it were a network issue, then the transaction in the other direction would also be slow.


[07/12/2022 6:13 PM] blackinsecure#3693
does anyone know where to find manufacturer-suggested prices for NVIDIA cards?


[07/12/2022 6:29 PM] glasgowm#9381
Kucoin gets 1.5x the traffic coinbase does. Usually about the same volume too


[07/12/2022 6:35 PM] glasgowm#9381
I've also only heard of ftx from Americans but seems it doesn't even operate in the US lol


[07/12/2022 6:44 PM] liquid_phase#4605
when i went to google them it brought me straight to a website that had an FTX US logo and was displaying a bunch of US celebrities


[07/12/2022 6:44 PM] liquid_phase#4605
ftx.us


[07/12/2022 6:59 PM] blackinsecure#3693
They have FTX.US just like Binance has Binance.US


[07/12/2022 7:03 PM] blackinsecure#3693
Coinranking, CMC, Messari, and Coingecko, all have Coinbase with more 24h real spot volume than Kucoin


[07/12/2022 7:09 PM] glasgowm#9381
Hence 'usually', kucoin has dropped a bit from its usual spot. Normally 1 - 1.5

what fiat gateways exist for ERG?


[07/18/2022 3:42 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Define fiat gateway


[07/18/2022 3:45 PM] liquid_phase#4605
presently, as far as I am aware, there is no direct method to spend fiat -> receive ERG. You need to purchase an intermediary coin, such as BTC which has existing fiat payment systems like changelly and coinbase, and then send that intermediary coin to an exchange to trade it for ERG. BTC/ERG is a trading pair on kucoin, as is USDT/ERG... but ADA/ERG and USD/ERG are not current market pairs in the market afaik


[07/18/2022 4:00 PM] mconstant#4986
I'm more interested in offramps


[07/18/2022 4:01 PM] liquid_phase#4605
take what i said and put it in reverse, and there you go


[07/18/2022 4:01 PM] liquid_phase#4605
send erg to exchange, trade for intermediary, send intermediary to your fiat/hybrid wallet like coinbase, send funds to your bank or withdraw from debit card


[07/18/2022 4:03 PM] mconstant#4986
done that before with Kucoin or TradeOgre... was talking about more direct routes... thanks

Hi there!
ergoplatform.org is not working for me, I'm consistently getting 403'ed outta it. What's the reason? I'm in the Crimea right now, is it a problem?

However, it works via 4G on my phone.

To summarise: 
In the first case I'm using local ISP and the most of the "IP-based geolocation" services do detect that I'm in Crimea. And ergoplatform.org does not work (403).
But if I use my phone ISP these services are consistently saying that I'm not in Crimea, assuming I'm in some other big cities on the south of the Russia which are situated on the "big land". And ergoplatform.org works fine.

also check the miner's web site or github page. maybe download that latest and greastest miner software again adn copy your BAT file over. and give the miner.exe atuh privs.  AND while you there at there readme ( Plz read the README) lol make sure the NIVIDA Driver is the VER Driver they require to have to run smoothly!! WHat OS u running?? linux , windows . TRY t-rex for RTX and LOLminer is a great one @Miggyy66


[07/23/2022 3:41 AM] coolRiP007#7839
I keep a collections of AMD and NIVIDIA drivers for linux and windows.  and HIVEOS is a great way to mine and it will tell what driver ver u r using and also the miner too...  just the versions they say! and save them just in case. my new evga bro is mining sweet in t-rex in hive os Linux based Bootable thumb drive! and can controll it thru my phone any where i go! and there's simle miner also great remote admin IT stuff @Miggyy66

[07/29/2022 3:09 AM] Matt#0925
My keys are paper, my wallet connects to Ergodex, ergopad, ergo mobile app. Really confused on how this coulda happened and why it'd go to another of my addresses but not one that ergo mobile shows but my nautilus wallet shows it. I'm so confused on how this happened.


[07/29/2022 3:09 AM] glasgowm#9381
Sure it didn't happen as change when you've done some other tx?


[07/29/2022 3:11 AM] Matt#0925
I did do a swap today on Ergodex but not sure why that'd move funds between addresses.

[07/29/2022 4:22 AM] glasgowm#9381
Because you done the tx with nautilus presumably so mobile doesn't have any knowledge of the new addresses. You can derive more manually if you click into the wallet.

Hi there! I'm currently thinking about starting to mine ergo to support the ecosystem.

I'd like start small but keep the option to increase this little mining experiment (e. G. add additional GPUs).

I haven't build a custom rig/pc yet. So I was wondering: does it make sense to just get a (custom?) gaming PC to start and later build on to that?

Any advice / recommendations / shopping lists?

Thanks for any kind of help.


[07/30/2022 11:29 AM] blackinsecure#3693
it does if you're then willing to convert that motherboard and CPU to be dedicated to that

Hey all kind of a newb question here. Given the recent attack on Solana wallets and the fact that we can‚Äôt store ergo on the ledger. If I delete my yoroi browser extension from my device, does that give me more protection from a hack?


[08/03/2022 2:48 PM] Thomas#5320
If I understand it correctly, since ergo is a cross chain currency, doesn't it become vulnerable to hacking like what happend to harmony one, wormhole, chainswap and nomad?


[08/03/2022 2:56 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
Not really anyway to say now until more details come out about how the hack happened, there's talks it was to do with a library that ergo does not use so we aren't affected. If you are concerned you can use an old smart phone as a cold storage wallet though also!

Benjamin Schulte talks us through the new features of Ergo Wallet Android 1.4, which is now released on GitHub and Google Play Beta. An important new feature is the cold wallet functionality which is a valid alternative to hardware wallets. Because it is not obvious how this works, he has prepared a demonstration video for this feature for easie...

Ergo is aiming to be crosschain but isn't crosschain yet. The bridge in development is of a new design so can't be exploited in the same way, but there is always possibility so the devs are taking their time testing everything!

theres always risk but the level of risk probably more depends on what is being used to achieve it


[08/03/2022 4:02 PM] Gugo#0177
Could projects like ZK treasury create 'insurance' solutions for coverage in the event of a hack, a deposit with part of the projects' profits for use after voting by token holders? it would be a dilution of risk within the ecosystem itself, perhaps even with some remuneration for those who provide liquidity for this insurance fund.

Hello,
I want to know why the blockchain is so slow for validations? Is it because of the lack of hashrate? Can this change with a stronger hashrate? or another reason?


[08/05/2022 2:09 PM] blackinsecure#3693
difficulty is adjusted to maintain average time to find blocks around 2min


[08/05/2022 2:10 PM] blackinsecure#3693
but yeah, with more HR it decreases the chances of one block deviating too much from the mean


[08/05/2022 2:20 PM] Sebus#2961
thx, the validation of a block to date is around 20 hours, my question was mainly whether on a day with several THs the block validation could take less time


[08/05/2022 10:51 PM] liquid_phase#4605
it sounds like a failed transaction‚Ä¶ The block chain isn‚Äôt stuck


[08/05/2022 11:32 PM] Sebus#2961
sorry i dont understand your answer, block validation as 720 block rigth ?


[08/05/2022 11:34 PM] Sebus#2961
TTF was ~2mn , 720*2mn = 1440mn/60 = 24h


[08/05/2022 11:35 PM] Sebus#2961
when find a bloc need 24h to be confirmed and ad in block chain

[08/06/2022 5:52 AM] blackinsecure#3693
not really


[08/06/2022 5:52 AM] blackinsecure#3693
are you talking about a mining pool's validation time?


[08/06/2022 5:52 AM] blackinsecure#3693
if so, that's their choice, not a blockchain's feature


[08/06/2022 5:59 AM] Sebus#2961
Yes i talking about mining pool. Thx for answer. Do you know why this time is so long ?


[08/06/2022 6:00 AM] blackinsecure#3693
it's a choice made by the people operating the pool, then you'd have to ask them


[08/06/2022 6:00 AM] blackinsecure#3693
my guess is that their hashrate is low, so they need that time to mine several blocks and accumulate coins and use them to slowly pay the miners


[08/06/2022 6:01 AM] blackinsecure#3693
just as examples, getblok pays much faster but idk the exact number


[08/06/2022 6:01 AM] blackinsecure#3693
I know herominers used to pay in 720 blocks, but now pays in 72

hello, I have a problem when reading the demo project. if  I want to secure there is only one utxo box for one address to contain a bool variable representing true or false, how should I write the guarding ergoscript?


[08/06/2022 11:59 PM] uli.pkm#0359
Hi, where must i write a "simple" idea i had about a extra"feature" to add to Ergo paper wallet who could make impossible for someone else who find (or steal) your stored paper with your seedprase to restore your wallet with the seed phrase and steal your funds. Its a simple idea i had and think it could be feasible to implement but maybe im wrong, i only want to share in case its good and the developers want to take it, im not a developer dont have github account and im not familiarized with github more than to download releases of software.


[08/07/2022 12:04 AM] wombo22#5461
I believe @anon_br maybe one of the developers


[08/07/2022 12:11 AM] uli.pkm#0359

[08/07/2022 3:21 PM] Sleek#2730
Hi all. I just created a paper wallet and am transferring small amounts from my Yoroi wallet to test it out. The transactions are taking forever. Is this normal?


[08/07/2022 7:02 PM] anon_br#2282
Yup, it's me! Please share your ideas


[08/07/2022 7:04 PM] wombo22#5461

[08/07/2022 7:10 PM] wombo22#5461
are you viewing the transactions from the yoroi side?


[08/07/2022 7:11 PM] wombo22#5461
check the explorer to see if it has landed because yoroi may have some syncing issues


[08/07/2022 9:54 PM] Sleek#2730
Yeah I‚Äôm using the explorer and only my first (out of 3) transaction has gone through. The other two say they are not in the meme pool yet. And it‚Äôs been like 8 hours.


[08/07/2022 10:18 PM] wombo22#5461
thats strange, id try to restore the yoroi wallet onto one of the wallets from here: https://ergoplatform.org/en/get-erg/ nautilus, satergo, ergo mobile or safew then try to transfer


[08/07/2022 10:18 PM] wombo22#5461
to the paper wallet


[08/07/2022 10:19 PM] wombo22#5461
im just assuming here that theres an issue with yoroi but if it persists after your try with another wallet then that could be another issue


[08/07/2022 10:20 PM] Sleek#2730
Yeah good idea, I‚Äôll try that. Thanks for the help!


[08/07/2022 10:37 PM] Sleek#2730
Yeah this worked. Just did three transactions in like three minutes. All went thru just fine. Thanks again!

awesome! no worries


[08/08/2022 6:17 AM] uli.pkm#0359
Will try to explain the concept/idea best as i can in few words

bip39 wordlist is 2048 words, can be grouped in tables of 1024 pairs ("matching tables")
My idea is an algorythm in wich with a "password" you get as result an "matching table" and it is used to code and decode your seed phrase.

so you store in paper a coded seed phrase wich are same amount of words and also all bip39 words, but not the right ones they are the pairs according to the obtained table with the algorythm + bip39 wordlist + password.
In order to get the right words you need to type them into the ergo paper wallet "decoder", type the password and get the pairs wich are the right ones, if you do the process with a wrong password you still will be able to "decode" but will only get wrong pairs as they are acording to a "wrong" table.
nothing is stored, its just an Interface, the "password" you type will give always the same matching table table as result after passing thru the algorythm.

thats great already that you know how to run one basically theres no financial incentive to run one for an individual its mainly to increase the security of the network

many different advantages

actually but depends on the person if you would call them huge advantages or not


[08/09/2022 9:08 PM] wombo22#5461
"Full node wallets don't experience the explorer dependencies light wallets do.
Sometimes in periods of high traffic. (Nft drops) that gives a user an advantage"

"Also you can adjust fee more flexibly than most light wallets and potentially have an advantage in the event of race conditions"

now that I wouldn't know but maybe you can ask that in the #node channel and also see what others feel about the benefits to them for running a node/ full node wallet


[08/09/2022 9:14 PM] wombo22#5461
if you cant see the node channel then follow these instructions: You need to enable them in the top channel in each category (best solution until Discord lets you subscribe to channels natively). Enable it in üöß‚îÇdevelopment


[08/09/2022 9:15 PM] wombo22#5461
can get some nice user stories for your video


[08/09/2022 9:52 PM] glasgowm#9381
wdym? You can make your node public using a web server, but still no financial benefit. You can also run off-chain order execution bots or oracles through your node for which there can be financial reward (although not very much atm)

why would I use erg? For example let's say I use crypto to buy csgo items or gamble on crypto sites, unfortunately there are little to no sites that will accept ergo for what i like. so why use ergo instead of btc for example

i like this project and invested, but i have a Q.: What would this project do, if US would ban all POW cryptos? Could imagine that because of climate change.


[08/11/2022 9:56 AM] muffinator#5168
I'm not speaking for the team in anyway but it's almost impossible to ban I think, could you stop them from mining it? Impossible really, stop them from selling it? Maybe you could on US cex's but dex's exist and other cex's exist so you could always exchange it to another crypto and sell it on an exchange, I don't see how it would be possible


[08/11/2022 10:04 AM] roullix#6763
Can the node run on window 98 ?


[08/11/2022 10:05 AM] roullix#6763
(stil trying to use my old laptop..:)


[08/11/2022 10:07 AM] Rissuyu#0480
they can ban it from all the cex's and without them there would be not enough volume to build a big project and get into the top 50 of all coins


[08/11/2022 10:37 AM] muffinator#5168
They can't ban all pow coins because realistically they can't ban Bitcoin if they do that all crypto will struggle


[08/11/2022 11:23 AM] Kecesi#0069
alright that's great to hear, so my main concern with ethereum is centralization and ofc pos and my issue with btc is that there's a large possibility it will become dated in the near future. so I guess my main question about ergo is what does the future hold in terms of decentralization


[08/11/2022 11:44 AM] Rissuyu#0480
good point

Depends what you mean. The development will get more decentralised over time and DAOs will spring up but its already an open system.  Ergo has the fairest start of any smart contract platform giving us the best shot for true decentralisation when combined with PoW, hard cap, etc.

Hi all! I has been a while and i just saw that Yoroi is strongly suggested to be abandonded and transfer funds to a different wallet. I installed Ergo wallet mobile, restored my seed phrase but i see much fewer Ergo than i have... I can see the wallet in the ergo explorer though.
Is it safe to transfer from Yoroi (browser) to a new address ??


[08/12/2022 8:03 PM] Telefragged#8068
If you have the seed phrase you can simply restore it in a different wallet

[08/12/2022 8:05 PM] Telefragged#8068
If you've made some transactions they might be in a derived address. Do you see more than 1 address on the receive tab?


[08/12/2022 8:06 PM] doucaniggia#1198
i did. I can see them in Yoroi but not in Ergo mobile wallet. There i see only 2 transactions


[08/12/2022 8:08 PM] doucaniggia#1198

Can't find a good screenshot, but if you select a wallet, where it shows you the balance, tokens and transactions on the top there should be a panel with 3 buttons: send, receive and addresses

Hi everyone. This is a quite technical question don't k ow if somebody can help with this. What are the capabilities of Ergo to storing data on-chain? I am fairly new to ergo but been long time in Cardano and been seeing discusions lately about the incapability of cardano to store data on-chain for rollups specifically, I know ergo and Cardano have some similarities, does ergo has the same limitation? Can ergo implement rollups and not have the same problem of data storage on-chain?

Currently yes, ergo is the most profitable coin to mine for some cards


[08/14/2022 7:00 PM] jjjllee#5923
interesting. I wonder why the price is going down again


[08/14/2022 7:02 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
When /if eth stops PoW, it's hard to predict what the effects on ergo will be. Personally I expect an increase in chain security and a decrease in ergo price, as miners who can remain more profitable begin to mine erg, driving up TH/s, but these miners are less likely to be concerned with chain future and more likely to sell as soon as possible. Past that initial reaction in the weeks / months after eth pow, it is very hard to say


[08/14/2022 7:04 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
All we know is a large chunk of crypto mining revenue has been removed, and I expect due to that miners will squeeze the rest of the PoW space for revenue

hello everyone
i have a question about ERGO blockchain mining specification
what are:
- Block time?
- Difficulty changing settings? ( every block or every certain point of time or after certain block number)


[08/15/2022 7:59 AM] Steel#8070
2 minute block time average, it adjusts every epoch based on the block times of the previous 8 epochs. Here's a difficulty history chart. https://cds.oette.info/ergo_diff.htm


[08/15/2022 9:12 AM] Khalid#5998
thanks for the reply
and please what is the epoch time?


[08/15/2022 9:17 AM] Steel#8070
I believe it's 64800 blocks

Thank you. I will have a look at it today


[08/16/2022 1:07 AM] liquid_phase#4605
Ergo transactions are eUTXO, that takes the UTXO model that bitcoin uses and extends the registers to hold relevant or arbitrary data. These extended registers along with ergoscript allows for really dynamic programming functionality to take place on chain - but in itself isn't good for storage of data directly on chain like something akin to filecoin - ergo is not that and is not meant to be. The NFTs on ergo, and every other network as far as i know, are all hosted on IPFS, a distributed filesystem hosted by participants across the world. The actual data on chain is relational and object orientation data, as well as smart contract data being big program logic condensed down to an encrypted string, bigger programs = bigger strings so more data can be used in a specific transaction, but i believe ergo does have a hard cap on the size of both block and registers

[08/16/2022 4:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
i like eUTxOs multi send better than roll ups as miners still get fees.  how r ada validators going to get fees post emissions?  theyll need a shit ton of txs. storage rent encourages a bare min or you pay over a 100x tx fee per 4 yr old utxo


[08/16/2022 4:46 AM] blackinsecure#3693
normal market flow


[08/16/2022 4:54 AM] liquid_phase#4605
as erg is a mineable coin pow network, without a consistent run and consistent traction, we are battling against miners selling their erg to take profit. eventually, the miners outweigh the demand - until the demand for erg, and the emission of erg to miners, is such that the miners selling has much less effect on price movement

congestion was on some light nodes which had not upgraded afaik and got stuck on some header height, and i believe they 'fixed' it with a node upgrade but im not entirely sure

Latest version, no specific port unless you mean you want to host a public node? 

Node doesn't require an oracle, there's the oracle-core repo but I've never used it. Should work fine too though.

When is erg gonna be listed on binance ? Make non sens to me that a great project like that is still not on that...


[08/22/2022 8:39 PM] wombo22#5461
got to increase volume and list on other exchanges first


[08/22/2022 9:10 PM] Tchaarm#2402
It is kind of non sens to wait for volume to be listed.. cause listing it on exchange that no one ( or maybe 99% bot and 1% real person use ) will no increase volume...having access to mainstream exchange is THE way to get volume...i'm not a pro and i dont know what listing involve . But guess we will see post merge what happen...


[08/22/2022 9:29 PM] wombo22#5461
ya they are working on a tier 1 exchange currently aside from that Kucoin is currently available which probably isnt 99% bots


[08/22/2022 9:29 PM] wombo22#5461
but the reason is because if you just list on tier one exchanges without any volume it'll cause the price to be pretty volatile


[08/22/2022 9:30 PM] Tchaarm#2402
Kucoin non-bot ? Look a those order lol its only that....that is why the price is so volatile on the contrary its only algo trade...


[08/22/2022 9:32 PM] wombo22#5461
o ya in terms of market making stuff probably bots trading with each other

Hey people. 
I have 2 different wallets on Nautilus. One is my dad's, but I manage his and my rigs at the same time. Before I used to mine only to mine and just write down how much is his, but now when I have 2 I dont know how to switch to the other one in ErgoDEX so I can operate with the assets.


[08/24/2022 8:29 PM] wombo22#5461
Hey! once you open nautilus click on the icon for wallets then there should be an option for connected dapps


[08/24/2022 8:30 PM] wombo22#5461
click on the garbage can at the top right of the wallet connected to ergodex


[08/24/2022 8:30 PM] wombo22#5461
then refresh and it should ask you to pick a wallet to connect again

So during the LHR craziness, I remember you could do dual mining Eth+Erg. And now lhr is over, dual mining is limited to coins like Eth or Rvn+AE,Kas, ect. My question is, is there any dual mining with Erg+some coin that is currently supported?

Hi I am new to ergo and I see you have an active community, I would like to know what are the main advantages of ergo compared to other layer 1s. Is there a specific use? What are the advantages of building on ergo over other layer 1s that already work well and have good speed / low fees?


[08/27/2022 9:50 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Much of this is covered through extensive documentation and blog articles linked on ergoplatforms website, but i can summarize my own viewpoint on it for you. 

Ergo can do everything ethereum can, with lower computational effort and greater built in security assumptions. Ergo, unlike eth, is scarce like BTC and follows crypto first principles. Erg had fair public allocation at 95% just like bitcoin, except founders did not premine, all 5% of coins were released to ergo team over time being mined. Ergo takes care of its miners and believes in GPU proof of work, and builds in the ability to vote with mining nodes, giving the network upgrades a consensus-level of approval needed before implementation. 

The tech, and mission behind it is in alignment with what cryptocurrency started as and what many people wish cryptocurrency still was. The people behind it, and who support it, are some of the smartest people in the blockchain space.

Ontop of this, its very easy to develop on ergo and the community is incredibly supportive of cross collaboration and open source development, and ergo does developer competitions every so often as well to ignite parts of the ecosystem.

heres a video from herominers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SnpCF67kyc&ab_channel=HeroMiners if you already have a wallet, you can skip to the 3 min mark. It just shows how simple it is to mine, the complexity imo probably comes from when you try to figure out profitability and maybe even what pool to choose

Hello! Does anyone know if there are developments in the works to strengthen the security of services like Ergoraffle and Skyharbor? As more and more people join the ecosystem I see an influx of scam attempts and it pains me to see people give money to raffles that are fake, or buy fake NFTs that are copied from other blockchains. As a start it wouldn't be too hard to create a simple "report" button that would mark the submission with a warning if enough people reported it.
People fall for all sorts of things and the crypto world is a mine field of scams. I would love to see Ergo be the safer blockchain, also for the newcomers.


[08/28/2022 9:13 PM] glasgowm#9381
Raffles are refunded so scams aren't actually successful. AuctionHouse has built in artist verification and has more planned in their upcoming release. SkyHarbor is pre-approved only as a safer alternative to the AH.

Thanks for the reply. I guess raffles are refunded if they do not reach their goal, but I think there was a case of someone pretending to be Ergo Whale actually managing to secure some funds. I'll have to do more research on the AH artist verification, this is very interesting!

@wombo22 fiat


[08/31/2022 3:47 PM] wombo22#5461
Depends on where you reside for different options but your mainly sending ergo to a centralized exchange then exchanging there to fiat

kucoin and coinex have direct fiat onramps and offramps with KYC - otherwise you can use those exchanges or TradeOgre paired with something like coinbase or crypto.com (US platforms) or binance to do your fiat ramps

Yep so whenever you wanna liquidate just send to any like the ones listed above

[09/01/2022 10:12 PM] liquid_phase#4605
you can remove the wallet from the wallets page and just restore it with the seed phrase whenever you need to or on a different wallet


[09/01/2022 10:20 PM] Bogdanoff#2948
Ahh so there is no way to simply log out of it. I guess its unsafe to leave it open like it is ?


[09/01/2022 10:28 PM] liquid_phase#4605
depends. even if someone picked up your phone and looked at your wallet, they'd need your spending password or biometric ID to verify an outgoing transaction


[09/01/2022 10:28 PM] Bogdanoff#2948
Awesome thank you

Im pretty new to all this, I appreciate the help


[09/01/2022 10:30 PM] liquid_phase#4605
you can also generate a seed phrase using another phone or nautilus or something - and then use your main iOS device to see the balance in 'read only' mode, where you would need the other device present if you wanted to send funds


[09/01/2022 10:30 PM] Bogdanoff#2948
So my old phone laying around, throw the wallet on that and use read only on my IOS


[09/01/2022 10:30 PM] Bogdanoff#2948
Thats not a half bad idea either.


[09/01/2022 10:31 PM] liquid_phase#4605
if you want to be extra safe - reload the old phone to factory setting, sideload wallet app and never connect that phone to the internet


[09/01/2022 10:31 PM] liquid_phase#4605
you can then use the wallet app to generate signing codes QRs for when you want to send transactions


[09/01/2022 10:32 PM] liquid_phase#4605
my cold storage device has never been online - so it does not say any balance it says 0 - but the same address in read-only mode on an internet connected phone shows the right balance. So the phone never needs to be connected, it only needs to be able to sign transactions via camera QR code signing

Bitcoin was the first up the mountain. there was no trail, bitcoin figured out a way up and made it.

Ethereum, took some time with its approach up the mountain and studied bitcoin's route - and saw areas they thought were dangerous or too difficult so they made their own way up the mountain - using specialized tools they developed specifically to do so. Some of their tools were made from scratch and some, they borrowed.

Ethereum had some major advantages to their approach but their methodology and tooling ended up becoming indredibly expensive to upkeep and maintain, and the rock climbing path they pioneered turned into a tourist's route - where every person who went up crypto mountain went the ethereum route and thought "this is the only real way up this mountain".

Ergo, they know how to build tools better than eth did. The route ergo is taking is closer to BTC's original route - using tools and methods SIMILAR to the approach of both BTC and ETH - but using its own specialized tools developed from its own expertise with nothing borrowed.

Many people, see only one path up the mountain - except those who make paths for others to walk.

how does mining work for ergo? if a share is above network difficulty is that a block? And if so why do we submit low difficulty shares is that just a measure of work being done? is the end goal to find a share above network difficulty?


[09/03/2022 9:33 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Yea, this is how all pool mining works. Shares are just block solutions below the network diff. If you find a block solution above the network diff, then its a block. Pools use shares to keep track of the amount of work done by a miner.


[09/03/2022 10:00 PM] arkadias#4896
so in theory this was a block?

Did you use the copy/paste button icon from paprr wallet, or did you use your mouse to highlight and copy


[09/05/2022 12:05 AM] KillerSalad#4550
I used my mouse to highlight and copy. Its a PDF in its current form.


[09/05/2022 12:06 AM] liquid_phase#4605
that is why you had the spacebreak added to your paste. Text converted to pdf doesnt always render properly depending on your pdf software or method of creating the pdf.


[09/05/2022 12:08 AM] liquid_phase#4605
unfortunately, i would guess  that the ergo is not recoverable because the added space in the withdrawl address .


[09/05/2022 12:09 AM] KillerSalad#4550
Yes. The second transaction I corrected that and yet it still does not appear.


[09/05/2022 12:11 AM] liquid_phase#4605
if the balance is 0 with no transactions originating or destined to, it may not appear in explorer as a valid address sometimes.

you may need to derivate more addrresses until the erg shows up


[09/05/2022 12:16 AM] KillerSalad#4550
The address is separate from the three addresses listed on the paper wallet.


[09/05/2022 12:17 AM] KillerSalad#4550

Gm! Hey quick question, I am trying to find the power consumption of the ERGO network per year and am having a bit of difficulty finding it online. Anyone have any good sources?


[09/06/2022 4:06 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Just curious, what equation will you be plugging it into ? Comparing Ergo to other PoW? or just trying to find some metric to bring up in PoW vs PoS debates? Are you correlating the power consumption to other factors like transaction weight and outputs per tx?


[09/06/2022 4:07 PM] IG#4511
Less looking for metrics, what I am looking at or trying to solve for is what the price of ERGO needs to be at to maintain profitability if half of the hashrate from ethereum were to move to ERGO


[09/06/2022 4:11 PM] IG#4511
There are quire a bit of assumptions involved. For example power consumption would be an average of the miners or a median. Also assuming the hashing power of ETH is directly correlated power consumption so if half of the hashing power moves to ETH so would half the power consumption @liquid_phase


[09/06/2022 4:12 PM] liquid_phase#4605
gotchya - seems like a noble effort - i'm not sure where you can get that info but possibly it could be math'd by assuming an average wattage for an average MH/s and then looking at the total number of miners, etc


[09/06/2022 4:15 PM] IG#4511
My idea currently is to use the mining calculators that exist for profitability to see how profitable it would be to mine ERGO after the increase in hashing power. The other thing trying to solve or find the increase in network difficulty

True, I am going off a recent survey of ETH miners and of the survey 50% favored ERGO.


[09/06/2022 4:50 PM] IG#4511
You are right 50% immediately is way to much.

[09/06/2022 4:53 PM] IG#4511
True true, ideally once I can get closer to a final value changing percentage hashing power moving to ERGO isnt bad. More stuck on difficulty at the moment. How does difficulty of ERGO adjust to the increase in hashing power @blackinsecure

Is there single staking ERG?


[09/06/2022 5:48 PM] liquid_phase#4605
erg is proof of work, not proof of stake.

You can use erg to buy tokens like Ergopad, and stake those tokens on Ergopad's website. But Erg itself is not something you can stake

How about some core devs that are "leftist/rightist"  - I know everyone has a side - but is good to know what side ERGO philosophy is before I enter this battle, to not fight on the wrong side, haha.

I mean, if a core dev put a hack on the code, without other people knowing - I know is open source, but who has time to verify every committed code every day to have sure you aren't running a "hackable" one?


[09/07/2022 1:40 PM] VertErgo#5544
Difficulty adjustment question: What happens if Ergo's hashrate goes way up  and then crashes?  Can we get to a point where there are extremly long block times (approaching infinity theoretically), which causes a negative feedback loop with miners choosing other crypto to mine?  Can a sudden increase in ERG price coinciding with ETH merge (huge Ergo hashrate spike) followed by a modest drop in price and subsequent collapse in hashrate bring Ergo to a crawl?  Perhaps look at a "failsafe trigger" for difficulty adjustments or use other difficulty adjustment protocols.  

I'm just worried folks are ignoring this possibility thinking it'll never happen....

I'm a miner BTW, and the only thing I don't like about ERG is it's difficulty adjustment algorithm.

Difficulty readjustment in Ergo takes into account 8 last epochs (1024 blocks each), it helps to stabilize block time in case of non-linear hashrate changes, and also reduces profitability of coin-hopping. A published paper on that https://t.co/n91wzocRFA #dailyergofact

Well, good one, but in the paper/teory everything is beautiful, put the bad hands on it and we will see, like we have today with the Fiat system, etc.

[09/07/2022 1:56 PM] jadsonlourenco#8953
in 2008 it was hard to fork... But today, including now that a lot of hash power can make many forks in the same time...


[09/07/2022 1:57 PM] glasgowm#9381
Autolykos is slow, but I see it as more of a benefit for the merge. It responds better with steady hash-rate growth ime. Crashes can be painful, but the delay also protects from daily volatility. (and returns higher profits for longer)

A modest drop in price wouldn't do it IMO, a full scale crash would be painful but we've went through a couple of them already

So, is good to think that people are good and bad. But the question I'm asking is: how ERGO is prepared to handle the bad actors that will try to kill the project?


[09/07/2022 1:59 PM] jadsonlourenco#8953
How ERGO is prepared to handle an internal bad actor (is possible)?


[09/07/2022 2:00 PM] jadsonlourenco#8953
White paper don't solve that... I think the "code" solves, but a bad code can kill a good system anyway...


[09/07/2022 2:02 PM] jadsonlourenco#8953
Is one solution, not tested yet with much hash power that will be available after the Merge, but a solution to handle bad miners actors. I think the same, but we will see.


[09/07/2022 2:47 PM] glasgowm#9381
Ergo is against hard-forks, and kushti has already had a proposed soft-fork rejected by community. It handles bad actors by having a strong & active community.

Hello, has ERG been available on Ledger wallet yet?  I saw the integration announcement but I could not find ERG in the Ledger crypto assets searching result.üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è


[09/08/2022 11:08 AM] VertErgo#5544
After the ETH merge ERG will likely be the most profitable coins specifically because of it's difficulty adjustment algorithm.  The nethash on Ergo can easily go up by a factor of 10-20 (not a steady growth), bringing block times down to just 6-12 seconds maybe even less.  Following a few epochs of ERG difficulty adjustments, ERG nethash will drop off a cliff as a huge number of miners chase profitability (other difficulty algorithms adjust much quicker) causing an unstable spiral of miners choosing other projects bringing ERG block times to potentially more than 40 minutes... this is an extremely bad scenario for Ergo and unfortunately the odds of it happening aren't negligible.  Please do not ignore and have a plan in case this happens.  Hope for the best and plan for the worst.


[09/08/2022 11:31 AM] VertErgo#5544
I'm usually very optimistic, sorry about the FUD... hopefully, none of the above happens.


[09/08/2022 11:49 AM] glasgowm#9381

If there is a 10-20x increase in hashrate from miners post ETH merge, there may be a 10-20x decrease in hashrate after a few ERG epochs.  Worst case on this hypothesis is 20x120 secs=40 min block times.

Sigusd supply issues? I love the ergo project and believe in it 100%. What pulled me to the ergo project is the sigusd NCD backed stable coin. I have a roofing supply business and wanted to turn on my roofing customers onto sigusd so we can all transact in it. Our avg order is $75k usd. So I went tk go see how I could buy that much sigusd‚Ä¶ well it turns out an order of that size is considered a large order. And would have to talk to a whale to get it filled.   How is the sigusd network going to scale if 75k is a large order?


[09/08/2022 12:36 PM] texas_miner#9831
@glasgowm  not bashing yall. Just really wanna start goving sigusd some live action and adoption


[09/08/2022 12:37 PM] glasgowm#9381
It wasn't if you'd tried a day earlier. Bearwhale has entered a SigUSD position and he's greedy like that and always takes 100% ^^


[09/08/2022 12:37 PM] texas_miner#9831
So how does the ecosystem scale if one actor can consume supply?


[09/08/2022 12:38 PM] texas_miner#9831
Its a game theory question


[09/08/2022 12:38 PM] glasgowm#9381
By growing big enough that he cant + burning him enough times that he learns his lesson.


[09/08/2022 12:40 PM] glasgowm#9381
And getting more utilisation into SigUSD. Having a big excess (He got 750k) is one of the issues - Until the point where it grows so much he can't consume 100%


[09/08/2022 12:41 PM] texas_miner#9831
I‚Äôm trying to understand that best I can so plz be patient. I‚Äôve looked all over for this topic. So how long will it take till there is a supply of 10,000,000 sigusd? 10B?


[09/08/2022 12:42 PM] texas_miner#9831
Is it all based off of active users on the sigusd network?


[09/08/2022 12:42 PM] texas_miner#9831
Exchange listings (I know thats coming not asking about when lol)  what needle needs to move to get to that supply of sigusd?


[09/08/2022 12:44 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yep, how long is a bit of string. 10B in SigUSD would require a 4x reserve so SigUSD alone would have to be bigger than BNB currently


[09/08/2022 12:46 PM] glasgowm#9381
DexyUSD will be more liquid, The way SigUSD is designed scales slowly and requires demand to build up; in return it's incredibly robust


[09/08/2022 12:53 PM] texas_miner#9831
Oh ok so essentially dexy is designed to solve my liquidity issue. Reading into it rn. Will do more reading later.

hey guys new to ergo community, can someone elaborate how ERGO is PRO Miners? (besides being pow)


[09/08/2022 5:18 PM] glasgowm#9381
Lots of reasons. PoW was specifically chosen (after kushti had worked on PoS). To fill that niche of sound contractual money backed by PoW. Many settings can be changed by miners, and the chain is ultimately governed by them.

https://docs.ergoplatform.com/mining/governance/ 

Larger changes can be made with Soft-forks with a 90% supermajority, and aims to avoid hard-forks completely by having a simple base layer and putting the complexity on the application layer. 

The high flexibility of the ErgoScript programming model and novel features baked into erg will allow a vast miner ecosystem with things like subpooling, PoW-tokens, sidechain fees, L2s, log-space mining, light clients, etc.

When providing liquidity, what is actually happening, and what does "impermanent loss" mean, if you were describing it for a 6 years old child?


[09/08/2022 7:58 PM] mattam#8988
You provide liquidity in a pair. As the pool processes buy/sell orders and the price changes, your distribution of the pair will change ‚Äî you‚Äôll have more of one token in the pair, less of the other. This imbalance compared to your starting pair distribution is called impermanent loss. It‚Äôs permanent when you withdraw you liquidity.

Hi, tried to post on reddit but my threads get auto removed, maybe my acc has to little karma. Anyone else experiencing problems with huobi deposits? I opened a new account deposited some erg (> min. deposit), the transaction went through, got an email from huobi confirming my deposit (more then 16hrs ago) but my balance is still 0, my erg dont show up. Sorry if this is also the wrong place to ask, just trying to find out whats going on or if i missed something


[09/09/2022 2:22 PM] glasgowm#9381
Maybe a keyword trigger removal on reddit. 

Most peoples deposits have been fine from what I've seen, can you see the tx in Huobi? Try opening a support ticket


[09/09/2022 2:32 PM] tapedecky#9672
i cant see anything in the huobi app or website, its complete clean, no record of my transaction. i tried opening a support ticket but the app just keeps refreshing when i try to open the support tab.  The confirmation email has no additional info, just: you have successfully deposited 10erg to your exchange account. Thats why im abit clueless what to do now. Luckily it was just a small test transaction, was planing to provide more liquidity. tx:5ddca7e9bbdbe1d0c89e48b8787f0b19ead3014d9c224ba6535d94d09a5c0c70

Has 449 confirmations so should be clear, there's a support email there you can try - but sounds like your app is a bit buggy

I'm reading up on Ergo Nodes, and from what I've read an Ergo node is basically a device that enables the use of the REST API? But where does it send its requests? Is that where Oracle services comes in to use(to receive Node requests), or is it a local DB? What's the function of an Oracle then?


[09/10/2022 3:54 AM] mugen_mu#1660
So is the long difficulty adjustments to prevent this type of coin hopping? Is it to prevent what's happening to Flux right now? ‚¨áÔ∏è

what would happen if ergo got $100 would the fees be high?


[09/10/2022 12:38 PM] blackinsecure#3693
what fees


[09/10/2022 12:43 PM] Setvin#2532
to call contracts


[09/10/2022 12:44 PM] blackinsecure#3693
you mean transfer fees?


[09/10/2022 12:44 PM] Setvin#2532
fees


[09/10/2022 12:44 PM] blackinsecure#3693
they're around 0.001 ERG


[09/10/2022 12:44 PM] Setvin#2532
so if erg was the price of eth


[09/10/2022 12:45 PM] Setvin#2532
it would still be just as expensive


[09/10/2022 12:45 PM] Setvin#2532
$10


[09/10/2022 12:49 PM] blackinsecure#3693
smart contracts work differently on eUTXO though


[09/10/2022 12:50 PM] blackinsecure#3693
you don't have to call a contract for every single input/output combination


[09/10/2022 12:50 PM] blackinsecure#3693
you can several outputs in one transaction


[09/10/2022 12:50 PM] blackinsecure#3693
record is 15k outputs right now


[09/10/2022 12:58 PM] Setvin#2532
so it would not scale directly


[09/10/2022 12:59 PM] Setvin#2532
larger transactions would theoretically be more efficent


[09/10/2022 12:59 PM] Setvin#2532
up to a point


[09/10/2022 1:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
The fee is adjustable and the point is to scale via off-chain/L2, bundled and settled on Ergo as one transaction.

NFT is usually just a link to an image (on IPFS if you use auctionhouse). Can do on-chain ones as the person above asked but more restrictive and not in common use. So would be a gif rather than css


[09/14/2022 3:45 PM] MGpai#4313
I would talk to Skyharbor and AuctionHouse to implement this


[09/14/2022 3:46 PM] MGpai#4313

Wallets have their own independent development going on where the devs either will or wont add features based on neccessity. For reference to your question, the ergo wallet Terminus app (official wallet app) has something called the Mosaik framework which is a scripting / plugin serialization thing that allows for the wallet to communicate with dApps. it is also open source

On the other hand, Nautilus is open source typescript/javascript and so it can be easily forked or a PR made to add functionality that doesn't currently exist.

I have reached out to Nemo, developer of nautilus, with a similar question about propagating and displaying certain types of NFT in a certain way. The answer is that  Yes, it's definitely do-able, but if it doesn't currently exist and you want it its up to you to make it, everyone is really busy launching their offering during a very hectic time

if you pay Alice with address 1 on your ergo wallet, and then Bob pays on address 2 on the same wallet, is Bob able to see address 1?


[09/14/2022 7:19 PM] liquid_phase#4605
@Balvand 
Address 1 is the primary address, and Address 2,3,... etc are derived addresses which stay disconnected from the main address from the viewpoint of the explorer unless they have a UTXO interaction based on your outputs . 

Example: You have 20 Erg. You received this 20 erg in 5 payments of 4 erg each. This means you have 5 UTXO boxes inside Address 1, and the address aggregates their value into one sum. You send Alice 12 erg from Address 1, and three UTXO boxes each containing 4 erg are 'spent' and send to Alice, where two of the UTXO boxes remain untouched since there was round values used and calculated for. If you were to send 19 erg to Alice, it would use all 5 UTXO boxes, but one of them would come back to Address 1 as a single unspent UTXO with 1 Erg in it.

Now, if Bob sent 10 erg to Address 2, in theory as long as you never interacted between the two addresses on a dapp like a dex (it's easy to have funds move between addresses accidentally using spectrumDex), then in theory that 10erg would be visible to you under the aggregate fund total sum but to the perspective of bob it would be a singular non-connected address.

If you had 20 erg in Address 1 & 5 Erg in Address 2, and sent 25 Erg to Alice, then it would come from both addresses in the transaction and Bob would have visibility on their interaction if he knew address 2

a wallet can contain multiple 'accounts' where each 'account' can contain multiple derived addresses

you can use any node url/ip inside the ergo mobile app settings


[09/14/2022 7:53 PM] rayzor#2563
Yeah but it's mobile. One of the most unsecure devices to use as a wallet.

I'm talking about a normal Gui wallet that most projects have on a PC.


[09/14/2022 7:55 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i believe safew is a node wallet and can be run locally and compiled from source if you are concerned about the mobile app encryption, or you can use an older mobile device (not network connected) as a coldstorage device with a newer connected device in read only wallet mode

the paper uses batching transaction blocks in the main chain blocks for throughput while also using multiple voter chains for faster finality


[09/15/2022 3:35 AM] Porridge#8651
For miners it means more hash outputs can create some type of blocks, adding the benefit of more regular rewards for solo miners

to implement it in practice it would take a lot of work and testing of course üòÑ

Are there any plans the adjust the difficulty quicker. When it spikes up a lot of hash is going to dump out and possibly compromise the security of the chain. I love this project but I think the difficulty adjustment is too slow.


[09/16/2022 12:37 PM] ChrisP#2550
On the flipside when all the hash power rushes back in when the difficulty spikes down miners will be making a lot more than they should which could cause an issue with token supply

Ergo will be listed on Binance when enough of its customers want it. Additionally, the team can never give specifics about a listing until the exchange announces it. Listings are covered by a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and leaks put the listing itself at risk. Just keep your eyes on social media for the announcements.

How do we propose to fix this difficulty, its way to long and we are about to see a 2 day cycle of  "Ergo Difficulty way to high" that causes everyone to jump off ( like it currently is we are at 146T/H), then 2 days later because everyone jumped off the Difficulty will become extremly low causing everyone to jump back on causing this massive influx of people again, then we are going to be in this massive cycle?


[09/16/2022 11:16 PM] carllittle1#3740

[09/16/2022 11:19 PM] Swiny#2983
na your missing the point, were gunna end up in a ping pong because the difficulty takes so long to update

It's just a way to constant attack the difficulty of the network. Wait network to decrease difficulty then mine and when difficulty spike move away.


[09/17/2022 3:37 AM] carllittle1#3740
In the last year there has been much conversation about this.   the  resulting answer is    not changing it


[09/17/2022 3:54 AM] Setvin#2532
its not broken its working as intended


[09/17/2022 3:55 AM] Setvin#2532
there is no update that can be made to force people to buy into ergo, it will just happen naturally overtime as people decide which coin they want to stick to


[09/17/2022 3:56 AM] Setvin#2532
or as the hashrate continues to stay high, the distrubtion will be much higher


[09/17/2022 3:56 AM] Setvin#2532
its not guaranteed of course, but with more people using ergo and rewards being lower - one would think price action must be the eventual result.

[09/17/2022 4:11 AM] Setvin#2532
its essentially a big ass circuit


[09/17/2022 4:12 AM] Setvin#2532
from my understanding fpga is good for training. teaching or simulating things


[09/17/2022 4:12 AM] Setvin#2532
like how architects scale down buildings, fpga scales up micro systems


[09/17/2022 4:13 AM] Setvin#2532
im not sure if it would even be worth it though ,depends on the output of the asic


[09/17/2022 4:13 AM] Setvin#2532
"ghostrider" is the algo, it claims to be "51%" proof but thats not accurate


[09/17/2022 4:14 AM] Setvin#2532
it cycles through 16 other algos, which its not easy but it is possible to make an asic for


[09/17/2022 4:14 AM] Setvin#2532
there needs to be a logic controller

[09/17/2022 6:03 AM] liquid_phase#4605
fpga are a sea of gates or transistors. Where a central professing unit has to refer to instruction sets provided by software, an FPGA circuit is designed to do specifically one thing very well and have a direct path for it - its good for things like on the fly conversion of information like audio visual data and is used in everything from my sound cards to military IR scopes


[09/17/2022 6:04 AM] liquid_phase#4605
there is a fellow here who has built an fpga mining thing. Its pretty intriguing, he has his own channel here‚Ä¶ but, proceed with caution (18+) #deleted-channel

the way I understand, you could use a FPGA to proptype an ASIC


[09/17/2022 7:46 AM] Setvin#2532
once the build is made with fpga you can print it on microchips


[09/17/2022 9:36 AM] PowerMan#9183
Have a question about storage rent. What I understood this is a fee deducted from your balance if you didn't move your funds for 4 years. How this is achieved technically? Because you need to know a private key to be able to spend the funds.

that's not so straight forward. implementing your ASIC on FPGA for prototyping is one thing, but usually comes with many limitations. a lot of work remain after validating your algo on FPGA to make a power efficient ASIC. cost is also another thing (I'd rather buy ergo at this point)


[09/17/2022 4:17 PM] Setvin#2532
the asic would be for something completely different


[09/17/2022 4:17 PM] Setvin#2532

It is possible to spend a box if height from preheader (so height of upcoming block) exceeds reported creation height of the box by storage fee period at least (and a box with creation height more than the current height can not be included into a block, so a user can‚Äôt cheat by reporting a height from future in order to save on storage fee):
```scala
context.preHeader.height - context.self.creationHeight >= Constants.StoragePeriod
```

(ErgoInterpreter, line 64)

Also, to spend the expired box, spending proof must be empty.

Then, anyone can spend the expired box by providing in context extension variable #127 (stored in input) an index of a recreated box (or index of any box of the expired box hasn‚Äôt enough to pay for the storage fee

so if ergo also had the L1 scalability solution of minting transaction blocks that get committed through mainchain blocks we could see more regular rewards for solo mining (less reward per block ofc)

[09/19/2022 2:27 AM] liquid_phase#4605
You are misunderstanding. This is how UTXO works. The sending address is a single smart contract box holding a lot of ERG. It sent 60 erg to an address. A UTXO is like a box within a wallet, if you received 1 million erg in one transaction and 5 erg in another, they would be in 2 ‚Äúboxes‚Äù in the same wallet. So when the person sends 60 erg, the entire box is put into the transaction, the transaction validates the amounts to be sent(Spent to the sender but unspent to the receiver) and the amounts to be returned(unspent to the sender) and then does so.


[09/19/2022 2:29 AM] liquid_phase#4605
further more, that contract address is,i beli3ve, the emission contract for miners not a person actually


[09/19/2022 2:30 AM] liquid_phase#4605
when ergo was created, all ergo were put into existance at once and put into a smart contract at time of genesis block stamped so it can be proven there was no pre mine or insider allocation. The emissions contract unlocks payments to miners

{Reactions}
‚ù§Ô∏è 

[09/19/2022 2:32 AM] liquid_phase#4605
so that 37360236 should add up to the remaining erg left to be mined, which adds up considering the amount of ergo in circulation is around 60 million and the total ever at 97 million


[09/19/2022 8:48 AM] VertErgo#5544
Do long block times create more lag in oracles?  SigUSD price is lagging USD price quite substantially right now. 1 ERG = $3.50 SigUSD vs $3.01 USD

[09/19/2022 1:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
The oracle pool is specific to SigUSD; it's smoothed to prevent front-running on the SigmaUSD bank.

ok I think I sort of might get it. So the oracle tracks the price of erg/usd and the peg is based off that. I see on ergowatch the price of sigusd = .3 ERG, oracle price of 1 erg = 3.30,  which .3*3.3= 0.99 close to peg


[09/19/2022 3:13 PM] no1smove#0177
But Nautilus shows 1 sigusd = 0.95 right now. I wonder where they get that from


[09/19/2022 3:17 PM] no1smove#0177
ehh nm I could be way off with that conclusion I'll get around to reading and understanding the docs one day


[09/19/2022 3:18 PM] wombo22#5461
could ask n #üí≥„Éªnautilus


[09/19/2022 3:22 PM] no1smove#0177
thanks, yeah good point


[09/19/2022 3:36 PM] glasgowm#9381
Maybe spectrum? Price there is set internal to the pool - no oracle


[09/19/2022 3:37 PM] glasgowm#9381
oracle can only move 5% in price every epoch


[09/19/2022 3:51 PM] VertErgo#5544
Can the Oracle update cycle be changed?  The Oracle update cylce should not be based on epochs/# of blocks, it should be based on real-world time should it not?  Block times can vary a lot which can exacerbate the problem of very slow or very fast Oracle updates.


[09/19/2022 3:52 PM] no1smove#0177
That adds up. looks like sigusd price on Spectrum x ERG USD price on ergowatch


[09/19/2022 5:04 PM] munch#5633
Okay, got my first mined ERG, transferred to huobi, traded to usdt, transferred to binance, this is NOT simple.... and full of fee's. :/


[09/19/2022 5:08 PM] Swiny#2983
i dont understand how we went from 220th/s down to 90t/h but the difficulty went from 21.67 to 21.50.......


[09/19/2022 5:09 PM] wombo22#5461
Ergo's difficulty adjustment is based on the last 8 epochs


[09/19/2022 5:09 PM] wombo22#5461
so going to have to wait until the high hash is out of the consideration of the 8 epochs


[09/19/2022 5:09 PM] Swiny#2983
wait so its 8 epochs ago? if thats what your saying then that shit needs fixing ASAP.


[09/19/2022 5:10 PM] wombo22#5461
i could be wrong though but thats from my understanding


[09/19/2022 5:11 PM] Swiny#2983
that shit needs to be fixed ASAP then........ difficulty shouldnt be any more longer then 12 hours IMO


[09/19/2022 5:11 PM] wombo22#5461
theres going to be a diff community chat tom


[09/19/2022 5:32 PM] carllittle1#3740
Diff changes every epoch by using an average from the last 8 so when there's a massive influx of hashrate it takes a while for it to come back down.


[09/20/2022 2:28 AM] VertErgo#5544
I think there were some false assumptions made in the research that led to Ergo's difficulty adjustment mechanism.  Unfortunately, we'll need a hard fork to change it... I for one would  back a hard fork to change the difficulty adjustment at shorter intervals.  I think all sensible miners would back it as well.


[09/20/2022 2:30 AM] Swiny#2983
Oh 100%. It's way to broken currently.


[09/20/2022 2:31 AM] Swiny#2983
Go check "ergo difficulty monitor" on Google and have a look at the 2nd page.  You can't tell me it's not broken.


[09/20/2022 6:58 AM] Fudfood#5969
Other than the mining difficulty that we are all here for...
Are there any plans to have ERG support on other established wallets like SafePal?


[09/20/2022 7:40 AM] WSB | Otherside Gang#3125
Total hash rate have dropped a lot, when will difficulty come down?


[09/20/2022 9:34 AM] Panabas#1258
Blocks remaining in current epoch:
844
Time until next epoch:
~79:26:36 -> 23/09/2022, 18:59:45


[09/20/2022 9:35 AM] Panabas#1258
and it getting worse as hashrate falls


[09/20/2022 11:02 AM] VertErgo#5544
This was easily predicted, but the choice was to stay the course and wait for difficulty and hashrate to stabilize.  We're at 6min+ blocks now, and it may get worse before it gets better.  The difficulty monitor does a really poor job at predicting the next difficulty adjustment when hashhrate varies wildly.  Next adjustment will bring difficulty down way more than it is currently predicting.


[09/20/2022 11:05 AM] VertErgo#5544
This will attract miners again and increase hashrate to bring block times down to where they need to be, likely lower...


[09/20/2022 11:05 AM] glasgowm#9381

is there any possibility that the implementation  of the difficulty math formula is wrong ? Because even with last 8 epoch calculation  is seems strange so small adjustment in difficulty yesterday


[09/20/2022 3:51 PM] Julizzle#5827
Any news on the integration with ledger live ? Somebody here was in contact with the ledger team if i remember correctly


[09/20/2022 3:53 PM] blackinsecure#3693
the epochs are taking forever because the blocks are like over 300s on average


[09/20/2022 3:57 PM] Panabas#1258
yes , and yesterday was 240s before the difficulty  adjustment from 21,66PH to 21,50Ph. only 0,16ph with double time blocks


[09/20/2022 4:00 PM] blackinsecure#3693
because the last 8 epochs are still high HR epochs


[09/20/2022 4:00 PM] blackinsecure#3693
but the current epoch isn't


[09/20/2022 4:01 PM] blackinsecure#3693
so difficulty is high but "very few" HR is trying to find blocks


[09/20/2022 4:04 PM] Panabas#1258
no there's no 8 epoch with high HR, some of them only. So i am not sure the difficulty adjustment yesterday was right

A vast majority of the community would greatly appreciate ledger support and have  wanted it for over a year. As for specifics, people would like some form of timeline to integration or at the very least that its "actively" being worked on

To me it was when blockchain assets were created before the general public miners were allowed access to the binaries etc. Kinda weird as Ergo says no premine etc but the erg exists and is just filtered through an emissions subcontract to pace handing out the block rewards to miners. Really the emmissions contract is just a pacing mechanism. The erg is already there. In my mind that is premined.

What Is Premining?
Premining is the act of mining or the creation of a quantity of blockchain-based tokens or "coins" before a cryptocurrency is launched to the public. Premining is associated with initial coin offerings (ICOs) as a way to reward founders, developers, or early investors into the project. Because premining effectively dilutes the outstanding stock of tokens, large premines are often frowned upon in the crypto community.

Because cryptocurrencies are "mined" using a consensus system such as proof-of-work (PoW), premining essentially begins the mining process by a group of insiders before the blockchain's official launch.

Someone with better knowledge correct me if im wrong but i think the total coin number for ERG was based on an emission schedule and created in full in the genesis block


[09/21/2022 12:04 AM] LSJI07#9400
I apologise. I know what premining is. Im asking because i thought i was going crazy. 

Its also when a group creates their token before any mining happens. As far as I can see all the ERG was created BEFORE any mining happened and ERG is therefore premined.

Its bad marketing and legally sketchy tbh.

[09/21/2022 12:10 AM] sigmabot#9505
Ergo's difficulty algorithm was designed to reduce the incentive to perform coin-hopping and improve stability of inter-block delays. Coin-hopping is defined as an adversarial miner switching from mining one coin to another in the beginning of an epoch then switching back in the beginning of next epoch when difficulty becomes lower. Difficulty in Ergo is adjusted using the least squares method, which adjusts roughly every 34 hrs using the past eight epochs (8 epochs=‚Åì11 days), to obtain the target block interval of 120 seconds or 2 minutes, on average.

I don't think you understand what premine means. All ERG created at genesis. Emissions are via smart contract. %to foundation is public knowledge. They didn't get a head start.  They don't own the ERG that hasn't been emitted.  If they want to change the emission schedule, it gets voted on by miners.  If they want more ERG, they mine or buy it themselves.


[09/21/2022 3:31 AM] deadmanjack#7418
So if they wanted to , could they create more ERGO in a way that isnt public .
I'm pretty sure they cant right ?

[09/21/2022 2:21 PM] LSJI07#9400
PoW has been popularized by Bitcoin as a foundation for consensus in permissionless decentralized network, in which miners compete to append blocks and MINT new currency, each miner experiencing a success probability proportional to the computational effort expended. 

Premining is minting the native token BEFORE any mining happens. Basic stuff. 

Claiming Ergo has not done a premine is sly and disingenuous.

[09/21/2022 2:31 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Ergo does not have any of the connotations of a 'premine', this is an argument over irrelevant semantics. Locked to a smart contract is in effect identical to the guarantee that 21 million BTC will be mined. There is no functional difference, circulating supply is identical, no miners have early access to funds.


[09/21/2022 2:32 PM] LSJI07#9400
its really simple. The ERG was created from thin air before any mining was done. That is a premine. Saying otherwise is just not true.


[09/21/2022 2:34 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
The problem is 'premining' has a lot of dangerous connotations. And at the end of the day, this is not a legal matter, there is no legal definition for premining. 

Without any legal consequence, what is the harm? Its not misleading in any meaningful way for a potential user/investor.


[09/21/2022 2:37 PM] LSJI07#9400
PoW mining creates the native asset as a reward when the solution is found and AFTER the energy is expended. Whatever this is, it is not PoW mining. The problem is most miners will not dig deep enough to find out if Ergo is actually PoW and premined or not. It would be good if the Ergo community didnt falsely advertise the network itself as PoW, with no premine or preallocation of funding for ecosystem building.


[09/21/2022 2:38 PM] Lingula#0929
Had crafted a response about smart contracts and fundamental differences from bitcoin, but I think you're determined to die on that hill.


[09/21/2022 2:41 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
I dont think there is any difference here. There is code as part of the bitcoin protocol which prevents 21 million btc going into circulation and there is code in the Ergo protcol which prevents 93 million ERG going into circulation. Both pieces are of code are not adjustable without hard forking. Both have defined rules for release to miners. Circulating supply is the same. No one had access to early funds. I understand that there may be some disagreement about terminology, and perhaps the Ergo team should avoid saying the word altogether, but regardless this is a semantic difference of very little consequence to users/investors.

This is fair enough too. I think premining must have been quite popular during Ergo's inception, so they felt the need to stress that it is effectively without a premine


[09/21/2022 2:42 PM] Lingula#0929
For some reason it reminds me of how much I struggled as a kid trying to move from BASIC and C to OOP. Now there's functional programming, which makes great sense but is a completely different paradigm.

You may enjoy reading about eUTXO and smart contracts. BTC is very primitive in comparison.

Otherwise, the whitepapers are fine reads. And Im sure there are resources elsewhere, but I find the best way to learn is to build üôÇ
And really, the barrier of entry to start building on Ergo is very low. Anyone (even without coding background) could build some basic contracts (with maybe a little assistance)


[09/21/2022 7:15 PM] glasgowm#9381
> Everything in Ergo is explicit, no special coinbase transactions etc, thus all the coins issued before the genesis block but locked with emission and treasury contracts (as specified in the whitepaper).


> There are no special transactions or outputs in Ergo, no money created out of thin air, and Erg tokens can not disappear. Thus emission is done via a contract living from the pre-genesis state. This contract sets concrete requirements for a spending transaction (2 outputs, 1 is for emission contract, second is for the miner, proper scripts and amounts for both etc).

üëç  I get it. Just everyone I know calls that a premine. ERG was created from thin air at genesis and mining only happened after genesis. Which is fine as long as everyone knows and agrees to it like you said. Marketing team just needs to whip the "no premine" stuff out of literature and websites promoting Ergo otherwise I can see it causing problems for you guys. 

Thanks for the update.


[09/21/2022 8:24 PM] glasgowm#9381
What other coin has a distribution like this? A premine usually implies pre mining a portion before genesis *and distributing* it.  All erg have only been obtainable via mining which is probable on chain and doesn't require agreement.


[09/21/2022 10:15 PM] LSJI07#9400
The point is I walked into Ergo expecting to have no premine and a PoW network. 

PoW since inception with Hal Finney and later Bitcoin has meant that real world energy is converted and minted into digital tokens once a solution is found. The mined solution is found, then the native network token is minted. Ergo currently is not proof of work. 

This is not PoW and was definitely premined. It does not have to be distributed to be a premine. The premined or created ERG just has to exist.

Not seeing anything as yet to prove the ERG reward is created as mined blocks are found. Exactly the opposite. 

The Ergo marketing team needs a kick tbh. I'm being polite in saying its sly wordplay. Others would call it a blatant lie and sue for misrepresentation of facts. Im not doing that. Im telling you there is an issue and other people may take advantage of it. 

Now would be a good time to mitigate the issue, remove the false marketing at least.

.difficulty


[09/21/2022 11:11 PM] sigmabot#9505
Ergo's difficulty algorithm was designed to reduce the incentive to perform coin-hopping and improve stability of inter-block delays. Coin-hopping is defined as an adversarial miner switching from mining one coin to another in the beginning of an epoch then switching back in the beginning of next epoch when difficulty becomes lower. Difficulty in Ergo is adjusted using the least squares method, which adjusts roughly every 34 hrs using the past eight epochs (8 epochs=‚Åì11 days), to obtain the target block interval of 120 seconds or 2 minutes, on average.

I don‚Äôt understand all this fuss about semantics. Premine usually implies *someone* has access to those funds no? If a coin has a total supply of 1000 and 800 of that was ‚Äúpre mined‚Äù but provably inaccessible without a hard fork, what‚Äôs the difference from having a total supply of 200? The emission mechanism is literally an implementation detail, unless you‚Äôre implying ergo foundation has access to those coins without a hard fork (?)

[09/22/2022 7:39 AM] blackmennewstyle#8333
Why people are so angry about the difficulty? Their project, their choice. If they give you the opportunity to change it, exercise your right in a decentralized and democratized way. If you can't stand it, leave it and go support another project, there are thousands of interesting projects out there waiting for support üôÇ


[09/22/2022 8:01 AM] Ricky1#8473
From my understanding the objective of their difficulty is to make it so people don't coin hop. They are failing at this objective because large mining farms are mining ergo when the difficulty is low, which is therefore increasing the difficulty at which point the large farms are switching to a different coin... thus coin hoping. The rest of the small miners who actually care about the project are left mining nothing and paying a lot of money out of pocket.


[09/22/2022 8:04 AM] Ricky1#8473
Basically they are saying that they want to stop coin hoping but are actually creating it. I like the project and want to support it but had to pull my farm off ergo because of the difficulty. They are obviously failing at their objective why not fix it?

The EF has the smallest distribution of any SC platform, ERG are only obtainable via mining on PoW; that is the definition of PoW - not some arbitrary rule that it needs to be minted there. It's provable through the work.

The type of coin-hopping the DAA aims to avoid is a specific attack (that this paper coined before the term was in use to mean profit-mining) wherein the difficulty is manipulated

üßµ A thread for the #mERGe

As ETH mining vanished into the ether, Ergo hash went 10x before the difficulty started to kick in. We've seen a huge influx of new #ergonauts across socials, and I'm sure many will stick around. Equally, many miners are unhappy with low rewards.

I see the discussions. I also disagree with your interpretation of PoW. Fundamentally its flawed but ERG knows about it and choose to run with it. 

Smart people here sure.

They missed the basic fundamental rule of PoW mining.

 It requires the the native blockchain asset is minted when or after the work is done. Minting before is just a premine and has little value as a decentralised digital asset.

Market it correctly. Premined coin and whatever ergo wants to call the coin distribution or emission system. 

PPoW is an option. Premined proof of work. 

True PoW it is not.


[09/22/2022 11:28 AM] glasgowm#9381
Pre-minted, not pre-mined.

How can things published in the whitepaper before the mainnet launch be a secret? Yes, ERGs are locked up in contracts, unlike Bitcoin and its forks which do not have expressive contracts, and so emission hardcoded in client code (which is worse for many reasons, e.g. RVN fork)

The beauty of PoW is that it doesn't require arbitrary definitions. The proof is in the work. 

There are no special transactions or outputs in Ergo, no money created out of thin air, and Erg tokens can not disappear. Emission is done using a contract from pre-genesis state.

hey! can i have a few super noob questions here? i just graduated from uni, working as a developer (mainly using python) but i would like to get a bit more familiar with ergo, just as a hobbi. in my first project i would like to make a discord bot, that gets a token ID (mainly NFT token IDs but i assume it is not important) and returns the wallet address of the holder. Ofc the discord bot part is not what interests me, i am mainly asking for help about the ergo api. I used the "getApiV1BoxesBytokenidP1" to get some basic info about the token. My question is, how hard it is to find the holder by address in an eUTxO world? On Cardano you have a stake address, that is the same with all of your eUTxO addresses, i assume it is similar on ergo? how can i reach this address?

also, any other tutorial is welcomed

[09/22/2022 9:23 PM] orobor#4005
alright, this is not a problem at all. the terms confused me, i was not familiar with the term boxes. on ergo you use one address in parallel as long as they dont consume the same boxes


[09/22/2022 9:23 PM] orobor#4005
this is great, cos it means the user will be able to keep all of his NFTs in one address without any problem


[09/22/2022 9:23 PM] MGpai#4313
dapp connector is the best way since it can return an array of used addresses

- a bot call that checks t1-5 angels on skyharbor and prints it in chat along with the price, tier, rank, and how much airdrops remaining per angel.
- a bot that checks the wallet for angels and reports how many held, the tier, the payout left. etc...

Normally by reorganisation length. The longer the reorganisation the longer the chain of blocks the selfish miner produces and attempts to reorganise the chain. Some blockchains use a no long reorg protection to prevent reorgs longer than say an hours worth of blocks to allow exchanges etc to set a mininmum confirmation time to ensure transactions are not rolled back and double spends avoided.


[09/24/2022 5:19 PM] LSJI07#9400
I look at chaintips generally.


[09/24/2022 5:20 PM] LSJI07#9400
That is a bitcoin answer. Ergo might have other protections.

[09/25/2022 2:10 PM] Lingula#0929
Difficulty went up after huge hash rate influx from the merge. Difficulty is slow to fall back down again. People want fiat immediately, and they want devs to make it happen. 

Ergo is amazing technology. I'd suggest reading the Ergo manifesto and decide if you want to be part of it. It would be much more valuable than taking advice from strangers on discord and YouTube. 

If you are simply looking for short-term easy income, you will be dissatisfied unless you are a whale. The correlation between the global market and crypto is very strong.

GPU mining alone will be a slow grind for a long time.

I am not worried about fiat I care about yield and long term viability. 
Have ergo produce 30-40 Ergo/Gig/month like it's supposed to at 35TH and not have some crazy instability I will mine it a $1 because on the bull run it will hit 20+ again.

[09/25/2022 2:51 PM] whatdouwant#2649
But at this pace you get 2-3 coins /month/gig and there is a problem that will make transfers horrible, it's hard to see the light


[09/25/2022 3:13 PM] Lingula#0929
Difficulty will improve later today but probably not enough to attract much hash rate https://cds.oette.info/ergo_diff.htm

Difficulty will likely go down further after the following epoch.


[09/25/2022 3:14 PM] Lingula#0929
I agree with you; I mine ERG to get ERG and support the network. Will be nice when difficulty is lower


[09/25/2022 3:50 PM] blackinsecure#3693
it will go down after today, but the next epoch will take forever again

I've been reading up on the 51% attacks and not sure if Ergo has something to guard against a 51% attack. I remember Nanopool used to the be top dog for pools. 

So far Callisto Network (CLO - Ethash POW) has PirlGuard to combat that which is interesting and penalizes the bad actors for GPU and ASIC mining. 2miners is their most dominant pool with almost 75% hashrate there.
https://medium.com/pirl/pirlguard-innovative-solution-against-51-attacks-87dd45aa1109

I just hope Ergo has something to combat the 51% attack because I really like the community, the transparency of the devs,  and the what the coin stands for.

im running a node via java, im wondering if we ever going to have a node exe like bitcoin core does?


[09/26/2022 5:24 PM] essaias#5787
what benefit would that add? technically the ergo devs could create a wrapper but that still would use either a bundeled java or the one found on your system.


[09/26/2022 5:26 PM] essaias#5787
currently blocktime is off 'a bit' due to many miners joining after the merge and then leaving again. 100 confs however is a requirement set by the xchange. not ergo. if you are unhappy with that, you need to complain to them üòâ


[09/26/2022 5:28 PM] essaias#5787
current mechanism was set up to prevent coin hopping attacks, it worked better or worse the last years but could not handle the hashrate explosion after the mere + miners now turning off the rigs due to "non existant profit" -> https://docs.ergoplatform.com/mining/autolykos/#difficulty-adjustment

Just wanted to know what the devs and the community take on how they defend against a 51% attack other than proof of stake. So far PirlGuard from Callisto Network sounds like a great idea because it penalize bad actors. 

I do apologize for asking this question numerous times but haven't gotten an answer or an input since if I recall one of the disadvantage of EIP37 Hard fork is increased risk of a 51% attack. Thank you for your time.

So you‚Äôd rather the project dies? Because right now it‚Äôs dieing. 6 days for block maturity is not okay by any margin. More hashrate will shut off and ergo will no longer have a supported chain. I‚Äôd much rather take my chances with a 51% attack which can be prevented than let the project die because of people being stubborn about epoch times

I have a rough idea about if we can create a smart contract to expropriate block reward when large hashrate swarm in, and release the expropriated reward back to loyal miners when block time goes beyond normal block time.

yes, all the nodes that matter, the pools that make the blocks, are already on 100~103.  I think the chance of both the 1st block being made by an EIP-37 supporting node, and 232 of the next 256 after that being made by EIP-37 nodes, is very high in probability.

Hypothetical question. Let‚Äôs say EIP37 didn‚Äôt pass but the devs wanted it to anyhow. What stops the devs from making the change anyway? And what determines who gets to develop on ergo or any blockchain for that matter?


[10/02/2022 6:14 PM] HippiePyro#9777
The devs could write all the code they wanted, but individual miners and pools have to download and run it for to be on the network. For that matter, anyone could code and develop an addition to the chain, submit it as an EIP to be voted on by the miners. Currently need 90% to accept the change for it to be activated in the code. you could make a version that already has it included but youd be the only one on that chain, ie a fork.
im not a dev, just a hippie who aint had coffee yet, but thats the gist of it, least as i understand ergo blockchain. that will vary for other projects based on their code.

Trying to understand ChainCash idea. Would it mean quick transactions of native and wrapped tokens, but the potential for big and slow chained transactions when trying to withdraw collateral or convert to fiat? If collateral and liquidity were different currencies, would withdrawal have similar slippage tolerance limits, nitro, and other features like in Spectrum?  In an absurd chain of events, tech like that could end up making coins like ETC finally useful as currency via wrapping or bridge - LOL

Why did difficulty drop so much ? Was this because of the network update ?


[10/19/2022 6:52 PM] wombo22#5461
.difficulty


[10/19/2022 6:52 PM] sigmabot#9505
Ergo's difficulty algorithm was designed to reduce the incentive to perform coin-hopping and improve stability of inter-block delays. Coin-hopping is defined as an adversarial miner switching from mining one coin to another in the beginning of an epoch then switching back in the beginning of next epoch when difficulty becomes lower. Difficulty in Ergo is adjusted using the least squares method, which adjusts roughly every 34 hrs using the past eight epochs (8 epochs=‚Åì11 days), to obtain the target block interval of 120 seconds or 2 minutes, on average.

Hi, I have a question regarding royalties for NFTs on Ergo. Are they hard-coded into the NFTs themselves or only on the marketplaces they are sold? Would a future owner potentially be able to get past this through p2p transactions? Thinking about minting on Ergo but would like to know more about this, thank you.


[10/21/2022 4:38 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
The royalties are part of the minting metadata and are accessible through smart contracts. This means marketplaces have the option have including this in their sale contracts (which both sky harbor and auction house do). Any listing on a marketplace which respects royalties cannot have the royalties bypassed since it is part of their smart contract. 

That said, NFTs can clearly just be sent p2p to each other (just like when you transfer across wallets) and in these situations or in private sales its up to the discretion of the involved parties

how is the 2ish% fee to mint on sigmausd distributed?


[10/24/2022 11:05 AM] glasgowm#9381
2% goes back into the reserve, helps prevent front-running/manipulation. Increases the base reserves which increases the equity and subsequently the rcRate in the formula here

There's a repository for improvement proposals here but needs someone to lead it. SigUSD was designed by IOHK/Emurgo and launched by an anon dev + community members and is just a contract in the wild, there's governance tokens but needs someone to formalise & push a proposals. 

https://github.com/ergoplatform/sips

Active discussions in #sigmausd which is also bridged with the djed alliance server and has lots of indepth discussions.  

#dexygold is another stablecoin in the end stages of development

[10/24/2022 11:19 AM] Jpow#2124
thx. will look into it. not sure if my assumption is correct about the flaw of the protocol and correct me if im wrong but atm it seems like if collateral drops bellow 100% and nobody wants to take the hit minting reserve coins sigusd depgs and if people do take the hit but ergo price keeps dropping than rsr would start hyper inflating?


[10/24/2022 11:21 AM] glasgowm#9381
If it hits 100% SigUSD gets a fair share of the remainder and RSV is out of luck yes. The incentives in place make hitting 100% unlikely though imo. As you get closer to 100% the incentive to withdraw SigUSD and mint SigRSV increase.


[10/24/2022 11:22 AM] glasgowm#9381
Improvements based on extended-Djed

    When stablecoin is close to losing peg, e.g. 150%, then ERG is moved from liabilities (stablecoin holders) to equity (reservecoin holders). Effectively losing the peg starts at 150% in this case. This solves the zero equity problem.
    When stablecoin starts to lose its peg, then the stablecoin holders are compensated by printing them reservecoin (debt for equity swap). This solves the stablecoin loss of peg at <100% problem.


[10/24/2022 11:25 AM] Jpow#2124
oh that's cool, what about the window of opportunity on redeeming rsv assuming the peg recover after people mass mint to maintain the peg? would it be a shitshow with people left holding the bag, if so how bad could it get? i understand how rsv works as a call option on the reserve if it becomes over collateralized but that seems to me like 1 person could hug every bit of unlocks to himselves.


[10/24/2022 11:27 AM] Jpow#2124
sry if thats anwsered in the math formulas, im to much of a smooth brain for that, i understand game theory tho üòÖ


[10/24/2022 11:28 AM] glasgowm#9381
Not sure what you mean, why would people mass mint to maintain the peg? what window of opportunity?


[10/24/2022 11:31 AM] Jpow#2124
yeah like if price of erg drops to a level that makes it unsustainable for the protocol to maintain the peg, and people just start throwing their ergo to mint rsv to try and keep the peg, i might be missing somethin?


[10/24/2022 11:32 AM] Jpow#2124
the window of opportunity would be the moment the protocol goes from not allowing you to redeem rsv for erg to when it does. like not everyone can redeem at once if its barely above collateral threshold right?


[10/24/2022 11:32 AM] glasgowm#9381
May get a bit of that I guess, but people don't like loosing money - it'd be more people taking a gamble on it going up than trying to 'save' anything.


[10/24/2022 11:33 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah you can only redeem above 400%, but if it had managed to pump back up to 400%, many wouldnt want to withdraw.


[10/24/2022 11:34 AM] Jpow#2124
why not? isnt the point of taking the option to redeem it when the stash is fat?


[10/24/2022 11:36 AM] glasgowm#9381
yep it's the best time to redeem, but people are greedy and would wait for 600%, 800%, etc. Some just leave it in forever. If it'd went way down to 100% and managed to get back upto 400% any panic that would've caused such stringent withdrawals would've dissipated likely. If it hadn't then people would redeem and it'd go down to 399%, then they'd need to wait for it go back to 401% - then a few more could jump out, etc.


[10/24/2022 11:39 AM] Jpow#2124
i mean that's the exact scenario that i would expect would leave a lot of people unable to redeem after a whale redeems all the available ''excess'' collateral.


[10/24/2022 11:43 AM] Jpow#2124
i guess it would depend on the amount of rsv tokens minted per collateral to the rate of redemption per collateral and wheter or not the supply of rsv inflates without people being able to exit due to the limited amount of available excess collateral.


[10/24/2022 11:47 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yep they could be locked out this way, but can still exit on secondary markets like spectrum. The whale has no benefit to doing this other than getting out first though right?


[10/24/2022 11:49 AM] Jpow#2124
yea, im just trying to look at worst case scenario cause well, it's crypto lol. like rn it's pretty under collateralized, let say ergo goes down an other 50% and some whale mints a massive amount of rsv tokens at the low, i could see how when the time comes that the threshold to redeem is reached, he could hug it for a long ass time, which would essentially remove the value proposition of the remaining coins on secondary markets.


[10/24/2022 11:51 AM] Jpow#2124
basically rsv on secondary markets would depeg from rsv on protocol because only that one whale whould be hugging all of the available redemptions.


[10/24/2022 11:53 AM] glasgowm#9381
sure, could happen; also a big risk for the whale though as they'd need to trap millions and risk it going to 0. And when we're 400%+ we're usually pumping and in that time people mint RSV not redeem ^^


[10/24/2022 11:55 AM] Jpow#2124
cant we only mint rsv bellow 400%? or am i misremembering the graphic


[10/24/2022 11:56 AM] glasgowm#9381
Below 800%


[10/24/2022 11:56 AM] Jpow#2124
oh ok my bad


[10/24/2022 12:00 PM] Jpow#2124
i'll have to look more into it more i think. in my mind there's never going to be enough collateral for rsv holder to redeem and that's eventually going to cause problem but more than likely im missing something with the way the tokenomics of rsv work with minting and redeeming.


[10/24/2022 12:02 PM] glasgowm#9381
well we've had a whale trying everything for the past 2yrs and he's not tried that. Maybe in the bull it's more probable
