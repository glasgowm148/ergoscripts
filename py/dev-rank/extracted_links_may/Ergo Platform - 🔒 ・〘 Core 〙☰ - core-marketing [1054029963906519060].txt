Can you make it private again please? Only needs to be switched on/off once for the bridge to work (changes the format of the number assigned to the group)

FYI won't be doing the ama broadcast to twitter this week. It's been pushed to 4pm utc as dan will be on flights and might be doing it by himself. That's 3am for me so won't be jumping on heh


[03/30/2023 11:37 AM] glasgowm#0000
Think we should schedule a monthly Reddit community chat. Have it the same day. Last Friday of the month? 

Can set up automod to post it automatically so we’d just need to remind core people to stop in at some point over that day to answer Q’s

Community chats on Telegram are good when they’re busy. But I’m in the ecosystem 24/7 and they often catch me by surprise. 

In the monthly community chat post, we could post links to smaller focused chats during the month, then I could summarise with chat gpt and post summaries for those who can’t make it.


[03/30/2023 11:42 AM] CW#0000
Yeah been thinking about it too. Last couple the tg/discord haven't seen much engagement as it's quote low generally of late. 

Then was thinking about Reddit, we have the weekly Q theads that are posted but I kind of consider them a little more higher level (somewhat).

Having a thread on there where we all jump in on a specific day, say Friday like ya said give a chance for more Qs but also the community to join in and answer whenever


[03/30/2023 11:43 AM] CW#0000
Feeding chatgpt and getting summaries each month would be good posting on the main twitter too


[03/30/2023 12:11 PM] glasgowm#0000
Weekly ones I often forget about, I imagine other people do too. If it’s a monthly one and we can get kushti and a few other core people to drop by, think engagement would be good.


[03/30/2023 3:49 PM] glasgowm#0000
@AndyLowe @sean_ergonaut - sent you invites to Taiga. 

Please use this instead of Notion going forward - and grab any stuff you want off the Notion. I’ve moved some over already and will migrate some more this week. 

We can have as many users or boards as we want with this. So we could have a seperate ‘Contributors Group’ one, or just invite people to the Ergo Editorial one.


[03/30/2023 3:51 PM] AngieHar#0000
No notion anymore?


[03/30/2023 3:52 PM] glasgowm#0000
No they wanted $2.5k to renew & only a few people using it sparringly. This one is open-source so it can grow with us.


[03/30/2023 3:54 PM] glasgowm#0000
editorial one atm

Thought I had but just sent it there to your hotmail.

nice. Im attempting to add images to tiles, i see that its possible, but not sure how


[03/31/2023 9:42 AM] AndyLowe#0000
so that when you look at the whole kanban, its more clear what everything is


[03/31/2023 9:42 AM] glasgowm#0000
You need to change to the ‘Expanded’ view, might be a way to set it as the default for the board

@seedubya Hey CW, i have a question 
when you publish editorial links to twitter, do you change them somehow? 

i’m interested in regards to stats, because i put bitly link that reflects clicks from telegram, and then additionally we have GA data 
but i don’t see twitter flow 🤷‍♀️

or twitter changes them?


[04/02/2023 10:32 PM] CW#0000
> (re @AngieHar : *@seedubya Hey CW, i have a question

        Using hoot it will change them but for the most part will use the bitly link

        Ah, maybe that’s why there is no data from twitter 
Alright, please try to use bitly, it helps with the stats 🙏🏼

@seedubya Hi CW 

I would like to confirm smth with you 
we were about to make an engagement event with Flux’s team for our communitites 
they propose a poker tournament at the end of April 

Flux Ergo with Kadena Mining Club (they have experience with big cross project poker tourneys

we will use this mobile app where everything is automatic and easy to manage  https://www.clubgg.net/
sigmanauts said they would love to join, so i guess it can be great entartainment for our communities and networking

my question is do we have a small budget for winners? 
Flux will give around 500 Flux ( so not that much) 
and we will make a cross promo 

how does it sound?

(re @glasgowm : *Maybe we should start a newsletter? Do a month...*)
        
        I thought it contradicts the policy


[04/11/2023 2:02 PM] AngieHar#0000
I mean people don’t like to leave emails in the ecosystem


[04/11/2023 2:03 PM] glasgowm#0000
Don’t think many would care. Not like they’re linked to their wallets or anything


[04/11/2023 2:04 PM] AngieHar#0000
I’m general newsletter is extremely good instrument 
On the other hand, even when you send to fill out the g form people were against this sometimes and ask for not sharing the email 
Just my 2 cents


[04/11/2023 2:07 PM] glasgowm#0000
Depends on the context I guess. If the g-form was tying their email to their psuedonym or wallet somehow I could see why there was pushback but if it’s just a newsletter they can subscribe to it or not (Anyone _that_ concerned with privacy should probably have a dummy email anyway though)


[04/11/2023 2:12 PM] AngieHar#0000
(re @glasgowm : *Depends on the context I guess. If the g-form ...*)
        
        do you have an idea why do we need to open the channel with a newsletter? 
for a specific content? bcs usually it’s about lead generation and sales that closely related to content marketing


[04/11/2023 2:13 PM] glasgowm#0000
Retention. Monthly newsletter is infrequent enough to give it a glance which may pull someone back into the ecosystem if they see something that interests them.


[04/11/2023 2:14 PM] glasgowm#0000
& those still in the ecosystem still miss loads - so a monthly summary would bring everyone up to speed.


[04/11/2023 2:14 PM] AngieHar#0000
(re @glasgowm : *Retention. Monthly newsletter is infrequent en...*)
        
        like a summary of the month you mean?


[04/11/2023 2:14 PM] AngieHar#0000
ah cool, agree with it


[04/11/2023 2:17 PM] AngieHar#0000
but if we start it, it’s highly important to connect it with the entire strategy and general content 
this is way big opportunity for the future like posting case stadies/ ebook/ webinars, tools and infographics


[04/11/2023 2:18 PM] AngieHar#0000
but currently no forces for such a content, maybe technical 
but that’s just a thought 
and to try ai maybe


[04/11/2023 5:15 PM] CW#0000
Monthly newsletter/recap is a great idea. I've also floated with doing a monthly recap video at the beginning of the year but struggled with being able to find the time to culminate the info with quite a bit going on. If someone can take the lead on an ecosystem newsletter im more than happy to turn that into a video


[04/11/2023 6:14 PM] glasgowm#0000
Yeah I can keep a log of all the announcements and draft something

@seedubya @AngieHar @glasgowm thoughts on when we are targeting for next hackathon?


[04/12/2023 6:11 AM] NoahErgo#0000
Thinking maybe theme could be Adoption & Integration.

Covers things like wallet integrations, atm integrations, could do urbit frontends for dapps, rosen network additions, integrations with other blockchain platforms

But could also include marketing based projects and things like that.

Would expand possible participants to be much wider net for the community. Of course more ergoscript based projects welcome as well


[04/12/2023 6:11 AM] NoahErgo#0000
could also potentially open up some outside partnership opportunities if we do some digging
