this and exchanges channel will be visible to the same people as before


[01/21/2020 8:25 AM] kushti#0978
nice, thanks!


[01/22/2020 9:31 AM] kushti#0978
so are we going to sell 4 BTC worth of ergs to bez ?


[01/22/2020 9:31 AM] kushti#0978
5000 satoshi each


[01/22/2020 9:32 AM] kushti#0978
hate to sell at such low price


[01/22/2020 9:32 AM] kushti#0978
but bez is bringing smart money as well hopefully


[01/22/2020 9:35 AM] mx#5165
should cover salaries for some time


[01/22/2020 9:39 AM] kushti#0978
+ some cheap promotion (Magnum? etc)


[01/22/2020 9:39 AM] kushti#0978
to get on OKEX


[01/22/2020 9:40 AM] mx#5165
sure, if just for stats, Magnum should be cheap


[01/22/2020 9:46 AM] mx#5165
altcoins vs btc will rather break up at/after halving so would be good to be on Okex by then, in the meantime there will be accumulation and there should be uptrend in usd terms alone, let`s say around March so coinall would be helpful also


[01/22/2020 11:03 AM] kushti#0978
there are more requests, but conditions are worse


[01/22/2020 11:04 AM] kushti#0978
4+4 BTC + 45K USDT in total, aside of bez


[01/22/2020 11:04 AM] kushti#0978
so it seems interest is growing

[01/22/2020 3:34 PM] kushti#0978
filippounits is willing to be the board member, but we do not really have such a procedure


[01/22/2020 3:34 PM] kushti#0978
any thoughts?


[01/22/2020 3:34 PM] kushti#0978
he's also willing to be in the Foundation


[01/22/2020 3:36 PM] mx#5165
I think simple vote on his proposal(why he should be a member) should be ok for now


[01/22/2020 3:38 PM] mx#5165
we won`t verify anything though, even with some rules üôÇ


[01/22/2020 3:38 PM] kushti#0978
why? rules are to follow )


[01/22/2020 3:39 PM] mx#5165
personal meeting with @kushti should be requirement üôÇ


[01/22/2020 3:40 PM] kushti#0978
oh no this should be real community after all


[01/22/2020 3:41 PM] mx#5165
yes i am joking but even if we set some code, anyone will be able to break it without consequences above leaving the board i guess


[01/22/2020 3:42 PM] kushti#0978
hopefully it will be improved with time


[01/22/2020 3:42 PM] mx#5165
we can create new channel with each addition and test for few months üòÑ


[01/22/2020 3:54 PM] kushti#0978
what will be in this channel ?


[01/22/2020 3:55 PM] mx#5165
all fund board things but then there is forum for voting so not an option


[01/22/2020 4:00 PM] kushti#0978
so the filippounits will provide recommendations ?


[01/22/2020 4:04 PM] mx#5165
while being a member he should rather have access to voting also, i believe at the moment chances of exploiting the board are weak so i guess we should trust in his good will


[01/22/2020 4:06 PM] kushti#0978
well actually the idea of testing sounds good


[01/22/2020 4:08 PM] kushti#0978
lets hear other opinions


[01/22/2020 4:08 PM] mx#5165
if someone wishes to exploit the board or share messages he will rather do that in both scenarios


[01/22/2020 5:15 PM] morphic#4133
I think board member should have significant contributions to the community in some way or another.


[01/22/2020 5:17 PM] morphic#4133
It may be one time big contribution, or small contributions over long time period, or both.


[01/22/2020 5:18 PM] morphic#4133
So some principles are better set in stone and not violated even via voting.


[01/22/2020 5:19 PM] morphic#4133
And I think this should be one of the first principles.


[01/22/2020 5:25 PM] morphic#4133
Another principle can be that people should have stakes (e.g. Ergs) in the project to participate in voting. Same way as miners have stakes to do miner voting.

{Reactions}
üëç (2) üíØ 

[01/22/2020 5:30 PM] morphic#4133
And we can  implement contracts for voting and calculating stakes more or less objectively.


[01/22/2020 5:32 PM] morphic#4133
And we can separate strategic and operational everyday decisions and have big and small boards correspondingly.


[01/22/2020 6:49 PM] kushti#0978
well said morphic!


[01/22/2020 6:49 PM] kushti#0978
contracts would be desirable but we're overbusy I guess currently to do that


[01/22/2020 6:50 PM] kushti#0978
so let filippounits stay for longer?


[01/22/2020 6:50 PM] kushti#0978
@mx no private group for Foundation members?


[01/22/2020 6:50 PM] kushti#0978
so lets discuss here


[01/22/2020 6:51 PM] kushti#0978
can we accept him into Foundation ?


[01/22/2020 6:51 PM] kushti#0978
I can ask him about a desirable role in it


[01/22/2020 6:52 PM] mx#5165
I think we should implement first principle suggested by @morphic instantly, maybe also ask him in this direction

{Reactions}
üëç 

[01/22/2020 6:56 PM] kushti#0978
oh so more contributions from him ?


[01/22/2020 6:57 PM] mx#5165
any contributions or planned contributions would be good start, can be first also proposals, similar to podcast if they require ERGs for example


[01/22/2020 7:01 PM] kushti#0978
ok I am on the same page then, let me deliver the decision to filippounits


[01/22/2020 7:01 PM] mx#5165
translation he did i would more consider as paid already bounty


[01/22/2020 7:02 PM] mx#5165
translations he could do in the future i would consider contribution to be board member


[01/22/2020 7:08 PM] kushti#0978
he also contacted me with his friend Francesco, who's working on kinda Shapeshift (started in 2013-14 though)


[01/22/2020 7:08 PM] kushti#0978
but talks about integration w. Francesco have no result to the moment )


[01/22/2020 7:08 PM] mx#5165
that would be solid proposal for sure


[01/22/2020 7:19 PM] morphic#4133
We also can have three level system (don't know how to call them) 1) first level is similar to stakeholders of the company, where a number of votes is based on the number of stocks. Can really use Ergs (or maybe ECT - Ergo Community Token). Not sure it worked for Waves, though. 2) second level will require some visible successful contributions and acceptance can be based on voting of other members of level 2,  and finally 3) is the level of Foundation where the number of people should not be larger than 6-7 but, members should be active (this is like a board of directors)


[01/22/2020 7:20 PM] morphic#4133
For example catena and Robert are perfect candidates to level 2, but not level 3 (catena because it is no longer active, and Robert still on his way accumulating contributions)


[01/22/2020 7:23 PM] mx#5165
voting with tokens accumulated over time isn`t good example i think üôÇ level 2 and 3 sound most solid


[01/22/2020 7:25 PM] mx#5165
i agree also that Foundation number of people shouldn`t be too big at least not at this level


[01/22/2020 7:26 PM] morphic#4133
Yeah, never seen WCT working good on Waves


[01/22/2020 7:29 PM] mx#5165
many people for level 2 starting i think with people like Denys or Amitabh, ending with people like Robert, Jason, MHS i guess in time, maybe 10 people would be ok for Foundation in total till some bigger teams are needed


[01/22/2020 7:30 PM] mx#5165
maybe there will be some big investor or miner in the future wishing to join also, who knows


[01/22/2020 7:35 PM] kushti#0978
as informal picture this layered model is good


[01/22/2020 7:36 PM] kushti#0978
lets keep it in mind


[01/23/2020 3:21 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
> any thoughts?
@kushti I think for newly proposed board members, the newly proposed person should provide something a written summarry of his involvement with Ergo. Who is he/she. What role does he play now (if any) with Ergo. Is he/ she a board member or representitive or ambassador of any other tokens or crypto platforms.  What can he contribute to Ergo? Why does he/ she want to be a board member.


[01/23/2020 3:23 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
And then open a Discord chat with board members + the candidate. Say for like a week, board members could ask questions and discuss anything with the candidate, get to know him/her.


[01/23/2020 3:23 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
And then vote.


[01/23/2020 3:24 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Also, will board members be given a salary just for being on the board? Maybe something to vote on.  My initial instinct is "no".


[01/23/2020 3:41 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I propose that we have an application / questionnaire to get to know new candidates.


[01/23/2020 3:41 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I made an initial draft, please feel free to comment, criticize and edit.

[01/29/2020 7:19 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I don't understand how Waves Association partnership would be make sense for Ergo. That should be for Waves community. Ergo is an independent platform.


[01/29/2020 7:57 AM] kushti#0978
we'll be in their marketing channels


[01/29/2020 7:57 AM] kushti#0978
about ways to cooperate, we need to discuss

[01/30/2020 9:04 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
If we are paying, it might make sense to try to get high profile KOL's. They might see the potential of Ergo and want to buy ERG and then shill for "free".


[01/30/2020 9:05 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674

@kushti 2K ergs he can buy on the market, or you suggest to sell him foundation funds?


[02/04/2020 5:44 PM] mx#5165
2k ergs or 2btc of ergs, if 2k ergs then he should do buy from the market, otherwise we should probably start from 500-1000 and explain this much people get, they are not poor guys also üôÇ


[02/05/2020 8:21 AM] kushti#0978

[02/09/2020 12:12 PM] kushti#0978
and what can we pay to Cassius(articles) and Carlos (design) ?


[02/09/2020 12:27 PM] mx#5165
one article from Cassius was about 300$, one infographic from Carlos was about 500-1000$, if they could agree for 500-1000 ERG monthly that would be the best option for Ergo


[02/09/2020 12:37 PM] kushti#0978

Seems only Sentinel is original. 
We should definitely consider integrations with other platforms.
But I think we should target the with original projects first. Like Waves, Sentinel, Cosmos (maybe).
@kushti are we joining Waves Association?


[02/19/2020 9:05 AM] morphic#4133
And among projects we should select those with clear mission and goals. What unique features they bring to the ecosystem.


[02/19/2020 9:18 AM] morphic#4133
Among BPSAA members only Sentinel and Ether1 have clear mission. And Ether1 have unclear future due to Filecoin, which have the same mission.

I'm in talks now with IOHK , Emurgo and Pantera Capital.


[04/17/2020 4:49 PM] kushti#0978
Seems we can have big guys to jump into


[04/17/2020 4:49 PM] kushti#0978
The question is how much token we can propose, and how much from Dev Fund


[04/17/2020 6:12 PM] mx#5165
10-20% of treasury max i think for such deals at this stage


[04/17/2020 8:22 PM] morphic#4133
Could you please clarify the "jump into" part? Are they willing to support development with money? Or they will mostly support marketing to pump the price, and then foundation can get enough funding from the market?


[04/17/2020 8:40 PM] kushti#0978
@morphic this is a dialogue, so we can ask for whatever (and be rejected for inadequate requests maybe). Details still to be considered


[04/17/2020 8:41 PM] kushti#0978
@mx interestingly , can we find big miners and ask them to sell


[04/17/2020 8:44 PM] kushti#0978
otherwise, the situation would be pretty weird: tokens are cheap, there's sell pressure on one small exchange (where tokens of Sasha's friends being actively traded  mostly), but no possibility to get into for a big buyer


[04/17/2020 8:49 PM] mx#5165
no we can`t and big miners never trade on centralized exchanges


[04/17/2020 8:51 PM] kushti#0978
@mx ok but where they're selling then?


[04/17/2020 8:52 PM] kushti#0978
doubt OTC market is well developed for Ergo


[04/17/2020 8:53 PM] mx#5165
always of the exchange to people full of cash, OTC market is well developed for anything, for Ergo big miner doesn`t even need to do anything, i believe we see very small % of his power


[04/17/2020 8:56 PM] kushti#0978
@mx any evidence ?


[04/17/2020 8:56 PM] kushti#0978
to me it seems currently there're few big farms


[04/17/2020 8:56 PM] mx#5165
similar to evidence that Bitcoin has one market maker


[04/17/2020 8:56 PM] kushti#0978
(different votes etc)


[04/17/2020 8:57 PM] mx#5165
second farm is what 5%?


[04/17/2020 8:58 PM] mx#5165
second farm could be IOHK


[04/17/2020 9:00 PM] kushti#0978
and the first one ?


[04/17/2020 9:02 PM] mx#5165
any industrial miner it seems, they can do the same to the end of emission


[04/17/2020 9:05 PM] kushti#0978
but then they need to sell ?


[04/17/2020 9:05 PM] kushti#0978
to cover ops cost


[04/17/2020 9:08 PM] mx#5165
no they covered costs already with different cryptocurrencies, windows will be more limited in time but for now it is also considered profit for someone mining it at lower cost than others, especially when it is a gem


[04/17/2020 9:10 PM] kushti#0978
then why sell walls on tidex ?


[04/17/2020 9:10 PM] mx#5165
i doubt it is from miners


[04/17/2020 9:11 PM] kushti#0978
I traced a bit, looks like it is from them


[04/17/2020 9:11 PM] mx#5165
from big ones, from speculatives ones there were ton of sell walls instantly at start


[04/17/2020 9:12 PM] kushti#0978
so it is from smaller farms ?


[04/17/2020 9:13 PM] mx#5165
and first investors, small farms have different costs, if big farms would put sell walls on Bitcoin we would be at 2000 now


[04/17/2020 9:17 PM] kushti#0978
early investors mostly holding I guess


[04/17/2020 9:17 PM] kushti#0978
also they can't create such walls


[04/17/2020 9:17 PM] kushti#0978
from observing Tidex wallet


[04/17/2020 9:17 PM] kushti#0978
it seems we can have 300K more sell walls )


[04/17/2020 9:18 PM] mx#5165
i am surprised that guys like Pantera, IOHK, Emurgo are asking for deal, has to be some POS attitude, they should be on exchange already until they think you mine it all with backdoor


[04/17/2020 9:20 PM] mx#5165
usually pump groups are requesting 20% of coins supply


[04/17/2020 9:21 PM] kushti#0978
pump groups not funds ?


[04/17/2020 9:21 PM] mx#5165
yes pump groups


[04/17/2020 9:21 PM] kushti#0978
funds probably more eager even


[04/17/2020 9:22 PM] mx#5165
funds have own researchers


[04/17/2020 9:23 PM] kushti#0978
the miner creating sell walls on tidex is making regular transfers of 40-50 K


[04/17/2020 9:24 PM] kushti#0978
(collecting from mining addresses before)


[04/17/2020 9:24 PM] mx#5165
then he is creating liquidity as requested while making profit already


[04/17/2020 9:26 PM] mx#5165
considering 8 cents from day one he is pretty happy man


[04/17/2020 9:31 PM] kushti#0978
well, ergs needed to get sold


[04/17/2020 9:32 PM] kushti#0978
without big exchanges and marketing could be problematic to sell so much


[04/17/2020 9:33 PM] mx#5165
yes, can see pretty much exactly the same start for any cryptocurrency with new POW algo now


[04/17/2020 9:34 PM] kushti#0978
322K deposited on Tidex for selling account


[04/17/2020 9:35 PM] mx#5165
then while it is nothing you should direct all funds to exchanges


[04/17/2020 9:36 PM] mx#5165
above promised airdrop, tell them it is not POS


[04/17/2020 9:36 PM] mx#5165
with premine


[04/17/2020 9:49 PM] kushti#0978
300K ergs would be not enough for a fund


[04/17/2020 9:49 PM] mx#5165
probably similar to pump group


[04/17/2020 9:50 PM] kushti#0978
funds are bigger than pump groups )


[04/17/2020 9:52 PM] mx#5165
that`s for sure, anyway i don't see how treasury can support any of them, only will hurt core development and grants


[04/17/2020 9:52 PM] mx#5165
they already can buy at industrial miner level


[04/17/2020 9:54 PM] kushti#0978
but how to find those miners )


[04/17/2020 9:55 PM] kushti#0978
treasury is limited yes


[04/17/2020 9:55 PM] kushti#0978
also mostly locked atm


[04/17/2020 9:56 PM] mx#5165
not knowing who are the miners is the plus to me, if funds don`t believe it then we won't help it


[04/17/2020 9:57 PM] kushti#0978
btw distribution is problematic anyway, with funds or not


[04/17/2020 9:57 PM] kushti#0978
not so much tokens going into hands of hodlers


[04/17/2020 9:57 PM] kushti#0978
that's why I am asking about providing liquidity


[04/17/2020 9:58 PM] mx#5165
yes but it will be with any new POW algo, miners understand it


[04/17/2020 9:58 PM] kushti#0978
better have it in the open and spread around exchanges


[04/17/2020 9:58 PM] kushti#0978
that some manipulations on Tidex


[04/17/2020 9:59 PM] kushti#0978
> yes but it will be with any new POW algo, miners understand it
@mx miners should sell provide liquidity on exchanges and sell OTC also ?


[04/17/2020 9:59 PM] kushti#0978
otherwise they're killing the ecosystem slowly


[04/17/2020 10:00 PM] kushti#0978
pricing is not the most important factor atm , we need boost in number of users


[04/17/2020 10:02 PM] mx#5165
if i knew that such big GPU optimizations are possible for any coin my attitude would be different for new algo, yeah the problem is that for industrial miners it was known fact so they don`t give a shit now about that assumption @kushti


[04/17/2020 10:03 PM] mx#5165
it doesn`t touch Ergo only, it touches every GPU coin and whole mining industry, all articles about miners leaving coin are about speculative small farms


[04/17/2020 10:05 PM] kushti#0978
well, mining is another topic we need to discuss )


[04/17/2020 10:06 PM] kushti#0978
but still how a big guy can get into Ergo ?


[04/17/2020 10:06 PM] kushti#0978
even York had a problem


[04/17/2020 10:06 PM] kushti#0978
and bought mostly from Treasury


[04/17/2020 10:06 PM] kushti#0978
now the situation looks better


[04/17/2020 10:07 PM] kushti#0978
but still


[04/17/2020 10:08 PM] kushti#0978
now we have Pantera looking )


[04/17/2020 10:08 PM] kushti#0978
and Emurgo )


[04/17/2020 10:08 PM] mx#5165
there was long time for preparation for industrial miner, there was good promo period before launch, worth an effort for sure with such prices then, now mostly people are interested because they see something is not right


[04/17/2020 10:10 PM] kushti#0978
then switching NO and getting big pools onboard would solve this ?


[04/17/2020 10:10 PM] kushti#0978
Ergo will be like ordinary PoW coin


[04/17/2020 10:10 PM] kushti#0978
which is not bad


[04/17/2020 10:12 PM] kushti#0978
industrial miner will sell slowly


[04/17/2020 10:12 PM] kushti#0978
or will mine through a pool )


[04/17/2020 10:12 PM] mx#5165
no, big pools will need to develop their optimized software first, by NO we revealed that fact being unaware how the business works, the only competition for existing industrial miner is another industrial miner


[04/17/2020 10:14 PM] kushti#0978
well many PoW coins changing alfo


[04/17/2020 10:14 PM] kushti#0978
Ravencoin is going to do another fork


[04/17/2020 10:14 PM] mx#5165
ravencoin is dominated by asics already because developers didn`t give a shit about knowledge that their algo is broken


[04/17/2020 10:15 PM] mx#5165
they had a choice


[04/17/2020 10:16 PM] kushti#0978
if no NO switched off then we need to get price boosted to get big miners onboard. For that we need for big exchanges + promo boost. For exchanges and promo we need for big guys, unfortunately. For big guys, they need for tokens, a lot of them )


[04/17/2020 10:17 PM] mx#5165
otherwise in time small miners will be kicked out from any cryptocurrency till the common field is found like HBM FPGA and GPU competing with each other


[04/17/2020 10:18 PM] mx#5165
yes what we need is based unfortunately on wrong assumption üôÇ


[04/17/2020 10:19 PM] kushti#0978
another option is to hope Jasons' / mhs' / bigevil's pools will be launched and will be quite successful to compete with the big guys


[04/17/2020 10:25 PM] mx#5165
yes, they will for sure be more competitive than known pools, that's the point of keeping existing config as it is, also as for very promising algo enabling competition between HBM FPGA and GPU, NO itself doesn`t matter from Ergo's side, forget about it, it matters only from the side that private optimizations are needed to compete with big farms, by keeping it broken we prove that we admit and learnt how mining works, by disabling or improving it we try to play fools


[04/17/2020 10:34 PM] mx#5165
Ergo already paid price for choosing this scenario while being unaware, it can`t be fixed quickly unless known, also broken algo is chosen, it can have advantage in the very long run unfortunately again as for time


[04/17/2020 10:45 PM] mx#5165
Like Bigevilsolo said, don`t focus on what is now, focus on that all people in the future can compete with big farms if they only wish


[04/17/2020 10:46 PM] mx#5165
that includes leaving NO as it is


[04/17/2020 11:08 PM] kushti#0978
heh ok


[04/17/2020 11:08 PM] kushti#0978
bigevil also said that this is a question of price&liquidity


[04/17/2020 11:09 PM] kushti#0978
so we need to do something with marketing / exchanges in the first place


[04/17/2020 11:09 PM] kushti#0978
big players will help a lot


[04/17/2020 11:30 PM] kushti#0978
Pantera:


[04/17/2020 11:30 PM] kushti#0978
Overview of Structure: We usually send a memo, but since the purchase price has not been decided, I will explain here. 

1. Ergo becomes a Limited Partner of Pantera Capital. 

This involves application and subscription (document to be mailed upon receipt and approval of application). 

2. Upon confirmation of Limited Partnership status, Pantera Capital invests up to 3 million USD in Ergo in the form of purchase of tokens (ERG) with an agreement that you utilize the fund, part or whole, in the development of your project and list in at least 3 major exchanges of good repute (e.g Binace, OKEx, Huobi, KuCoin etc) within an 8-month period. 

In return, Pantera holds the equivalent of ERG within that period (total lock-up). 

At the end of the 8-month period, Pantera can (if it decides to) begin sales of acquired ERG tokens in the form of equal proportions spread over a period of 10 months (Vesting period)... 

Total Investment Period: 18 months. During this period, Pantera Capital will project the interests of Ergo to industry leaders and experts as well as a larger network of investors. 

Also, as is customary, when Ergo becomes a Portfolio Company (Port. Co.) of Pantera Capital (after finalization of investment documentation), Pantera will provide assistance both in the form of advisory service, as well as serve as a link to major exchanges and other Portfolio Companies and Partners ... an effort geared towards further exposure and success of Ergo.


[04/18/2020 5:42 AM] mx#5165
even miners don`t have such amount of tokens, just show them total that treasury holds at the moment and we need to choose % we can offer

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[04/18/2020 6:01 AM] mx#5165
probably they should also know that Ergo foundation isn`t a company


[04/18/2020 6:02 AM] mx#5165
eventually we can offer additionally every month amount needed to cover development cost?


[04/18/2020 6:04 AM] mx#5165
priced in USD


[04/18/2020 6:05 AM] mx#5165
basically we need one partner who would agree to these terms


[04/18/2020 6:05 AM] mx#5165
rest can buy on exchanges


[04/18/2020 6:06 AM] mx#5165
Pantera didn`t do much for Waves as far i remember


[04/18/2020 6:07 AM] mx#5165
they were to create some regulatory body together


[04/18/2020 6:10 AM] mx#5165
IOHK is in different category so i guess we need to create own offer for both Emurgo and Pantera, will be the same for any new potential partner, it is pretty huge deal for anyone at these prices


[04/18/2020 1:10 PM] morphic#4133
If we believe the price is demand/supply ratio, then we need to increase demand while the supply is fixed. We have a fixed emission schedule, so the price can only go up if the demand will be pumped up. With big investors of different kinds we can increase the demand part. 
Based on the Pantera's proposal it seems they don't understand the Ergo situation at all, and proposed a standard agreement template. We need to explain them probably and I agree with @mx we can create ours. 
To keep the organic growth we need for both development and marketing to go in a loop like: 1) created a new #1 feature 2) implemented marketing campain advertising #1 feature 3) in parallel develop #2 feature 4) implement marketing campain for #2 feature etc. New features can bring more users partners and investors. This will be organic growth.
To run this loop we need fiat USD money.
If potential investors are interested, they can express their demand on the market by consuming all sell walls and maybe creating Buy Walls or pumping.  Of cause the want to have some guarantees and take no risks, but I don't think it is in our interests, considering for example 18 months time limit they mention.
I think we are only interested in organic price grows on the market, so the Foundation (whatever it is) can sell tokens and get enough USD to run the loop above. 
Anybody who is interested in Ergo should express his intent on the market.


[04/18/2020 1:17 PM] morphic#4133
In addition I want to remind about platform issues we still have not fixed. I look at the current situation (with Ergo popularity is very low) as the time window and opportunity for us to fix this issues in the most organic and painless way. (again natural growth is on our side)


[04/19/2020 12:19 AM] kushti#0978
From the talk I have had to the moment, my gut feelings prefer Emurgo. It seems they have better execution, understand the market, and have resources.


[04/19/2020 12:19 AM] kushti#0978
They think to do some DeFi projects w. Ergo, such as algo stablecoins for Yoroi wallet users.


[04/19/2020 12:20 AM] kushti#0978
Pantera sent some general stuff yes, we can talk with them with no rush for now and get'em onboard after Emurgo.


[04/19/2020 12:21 AM] kushti#0978
not sure about IOHK, it depends on relationships between IOHK & Emurgo I do not have information about atm


[04/21/2020 2:03 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
RE Pantera, this seems not possible: 
1. Ergo becomes a Limited Partner of Pantera Capital. 
This involves application and subscription (document to be mailed upon receipt and approval of application).


[04/21/2020 2:05 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
There is no existing entity to become a limited partner. And also I don't see how they could "subscribe" to ERG tokens since it is not possible for any new additional ERG to be issued (mined) unless there is a hard fork changing the total coin supply and thus killing Ergo. Seems they do not understand Ergo Platform at all.


[04/22/2020 11:24 AM] kushti#0978
yes, it was some standard text


[04/22/2020 11:24 AM] kushti#0978
concrete details to be discussed


[04/22/2020 11:25 AM] kushti#0978
and maybe they can't get into PoW coin like Ergo at all, let's see )


[04/22/2020 11:25 AM] kushti#0978
sent 5000 ergs to Magnum


[04/22/2020 11:25 AM] kushti#0978
will try to find time to write down expenses , maybe over the weekend


[04/22/2020 11:26 AM] kushti#0978
in general, that's about 1 BTC a month (recently paid from personal money to keep with the pace), also Citex + Magnum (20K ergs in total)


[04/27/2020 9:13 PM] kushti#0978
Emurgo is willing to get into Ergo


[04/27/2020 9:13 PM] kushti#0978
how much can we sell ?


[04/27/2020 9:13 PM] kushti#0978
~500K unlocked ergs currently


[04/27/2020 9:15 PM] kushti#0978
they need more though, we'll look into OTC


[04/27/2020 9:26 PM] mx#5165
I think we should stick to 10-20% of available tokens, everyones needs more, always will need more


[04/27/2020 9:28 PM] mx#5165
especially now


[04/27/2020 9:39 PM] kushti#0978
so 50K ?


[04/27/2020 9:40 PM] mx#5165
50-100 for me at this stage


[04/27/2020 9:41 PM] mx#5165
otherwise they can mine it with their resources


[04/27/2020 9:43 PM] kushti#0978
they do not mine though


[04/27/2020 9:43 PM] kushti#0978
and 100K not big amount currently


[04/27/2020 9:44 PM] mx#5165
it wasn`t big amount either two years ago


[04/27/2020 9:44 PM] mx#5165
but for core development and grants it is big amount always


[04/27/2020 9:45 PM] kushti#0978
I see


[04/27/2020 9:45 PM] kushti#0978
another proposal from them is to get %% from EF rewards each block


[04/27/2020 9:45 PM] kushti#0978
(say, 1/3 rd)


[04/27/2020 9:46 PM] mx#5165
you should present the offer like you can't give them more, that`s more reasonable in the long term


[04/27/2020 9:47 PM] kushti#0978
for example ?


[04/27/2020 9:47 PM] kushti#0978
seems hard to get into Ergo )


[04/27/2020 9:47 PM] kushti#0978
for big guys


[04/27/2020 9:47 PM] kushti#0978
also hard to get big without them


[04/27/2020 9:48 PM] mx#5165
for big miners it is easy, for speculants it is hard, you got the field for negotiation let`s say 20% of rewards from each block


[04/27/2020 9:49 PM] mx#5165
depending on theirs involvement, what they are bringing exactly to Ergo?


[04/27/2020 9:50 PM] mx#5165
IOHK`s name doesn`t do anything


[04/27/2020 9:52 PM] mx#5165
50-100 for me


[04/27/2020 9:54 PM] mx#5165
getting POS partners is some crazy shit btw but looks they are all interested üôÇ


[04/27/2020 9:58 PM] mx#5165
they exist thanks to POW


[04/27/2020 9:59 PM] kushti#0978
it is not IOHK


[04/27/2020 9:59 PM] kushti#0978
Emurgo


[04/27/2020 9:59 PM] kushti#0978
IOHK is insanely slow


[04/27/2020 9:59 PM] kushti#0978
but Emurgo is better


[04/27/2020 9:59 PM] kushti#0978
they have Yoroi wallet with 100K users (Cardano only)


[04/27/2020 9:59 PM] kushti#0978
willing to do DeFi projects


[04/27/2020 10:00 PM] kushti#0978
(algo stablecoin on Ergo)


[04/27/2020 10:00 PM] kushti#0978
help with marketing / exchanges


[04/27/2020 10:01 PM] mx#5165
i mean Charles present support doesn`t bring anything, he brings support by himself, so let`s say comparing to airdrop alos 100k Ergo max for me and for anyone else


[04/27/2020 10:02 PM] mx#5165
Robert works for Emurgo?


[04/27/2020 10:04 PM] mx#5165
i would need to see some special terms to offer more than 100k with 500k holding for core development


[04/27/2020 10:05 PM] mx#5165
they should understand it i believe


[04/27/2020 10:06 PM] kushti#0978
Robert is from Emurgo yes


[04/27/2020 10:06 PM] mx#5165
He is Canadian, having most family in Poland, very cool and skilled guy


[04/27/2020 10:08 PM] kushti#0978
so let's discuss more details and maybe collectively ?


[04/27/2020 10:08 PM] mx#5165
sure, giving away all existing tokens is pretty much useless imo


[04/27/2020 10:09 PM] kushti#0978
well, we're getting new ones each block )


[04/27/2020 10:09 PM] kushti#0978
but yes can be too risky


[04/27/2020 10:10 PM] kushti#0978
would be good to find miners to sell


[04/27/2020 10:10 PM] mx#5165
i can literally can get few sharks in few days who will take 500k and won`t do anything next


[04/27/2020 10:11 PM] mx#5165
partnership should be something else


[04/27/2020 10:15 PM] mx#5165
so my offer to Emurgo would look like this, i am spending 100k of Ergo on core development each month, i can`t offer more than 10-20%


[04/27/2020 10:25 PM] kushti#0978
10-20K a month ?


[04/27/2020 10:26 PM] mx#5165
yes as for a partner who recognizes cryptocurrency market it would be good deal


[04/27/2020 10:27 PM] mx#5165
fair deal


[04/27/2020 10:28 PM] mx#5165
similar for Pantera and anything else


[04/27/2020 10:30 PM] kushti#0978
ok then we need to formulate what we need and ask ?


[04/27/2020 10:31 PM] mx#5165
yes, what we need is in Ergo`s foundation template


[04/27/2020 10:31 PM] mx#5165
we can eventually ask, which part they could support the most


[04/27/2020 10:32 PM] kushti#0978
alright, who will discuss that? Ergo Command?


[04/27/2020 10:33 PM] mx#5165
i think we should discuss as Ergo`s foundation, Ergo`s command can`t be foundation, i can guarnatee that üôÇ


[04/27/2020 10:35 PM] mx#5165
well you as different founder could achieve it but not in short time


[04/27/2020 10:59 PM] kushti#0978
I see, I thought about foundations of Ergo development )


[04/27/2020 10:59 PM] mx#5165
yes, most likely


[04/27/2020 11:00 PM] kushti#0978
so I proposed to Emurgo to establish 3 channels


[04/27/2020 11:01 PM] kushti#0978
for joint efforts


[04/27/2020 11:01 PM] kushti#0978
in dev, marketing, and 3rd channel about getting Emurgo interested ) (so tokens)


[04/27/2020 11:02 PM] mx#5165
yes, tell them i am in random channel üôÇ


[04/28/2020 10:10 AM] kushti#0978
@mx it seems a miner doing sell walls on Tidex is found through an OTC desk


[04/28/2020 10:10 AM] kushti#0978
he has 380K to sell


[04/28/2020 10:11 AM] kushti#0978
and can mine 20K / ergs a day if requested


[04/28/2020 10:11 AM] kushti#0978
so it is a miner #2


[04/28/2020 10:25 AM] kushti#0978
which appeared around January I guess and dumped the price


[04/28/2020 11:07 AM] kushti#0978
And we have ~500K unlocked ergs


[04/28/2020 11:08 AM] kushti#0978
let's use them for speeding up the things


[04/28/2020 11:13 AM] morphic#4133
so, no hopes for prices to go up unless there is a demand for ERGs more than 20K/day


[04/28/2020 11:16 AM] kushti#0978
@morphic that's not bad at all considering that the supply is at 50K/day


[04/28/2020 11:16 AM] kushti#0978
so accumulation is still going on


[04/28/2020 8:10 PM] mx#5165
pretty much we are in accumulation phase, @kushti i am fine with speeding up the things but we should be prepared for many partners and unexpected things imo


[04/28/2020 8:13 PM] mx#5165
and unexpected pumps which can sometimes help more than partners üôÇ


[04/28/2020 9:04 PM] kushti#0978
that's true


[04/28/2020 9:05 PM] kushti#0978
well, as there're 400K outside we can sell a bit ? like 100K


[04/28/2020 9:09 PM] mx#5165
yes, 10-20% is ok for me


[04/28/2020 9:10 PM] mx#5165
of existing 500K

[04/28/2020 10:14 PM] kushti#0978
It seems they're willing to buy all the Foundation tokens )


[04/28/2020 10:14 PM] kushti#0978
probably they don't know most of them are locked


[04/28/2020 10:15 PM] mx#5165
tokens should be hard to get similar like they are hard to mine üôÇ


[04/28/2020 10:19 PM] kushti#0978
well they offer 5x market price


[04/28/2020 10:20 PM] kushti#0978
so they know is easily pumpable


[04/28/2020 10:20 PM] kushti#0978
with enough resources (media, exchanges)


[04/28/2020 10:20 PM] mx#5165
10-20% still for me even at this price, they know it is cheap, no matters if Putin calls also üôÇ


[04/28/2020 10:20 PM] kushti#0978
ahaha


[04/28/2020 10:22 PM] kushti#0978
well, now four variable in the equation:
* Emurgo
* Pantera
* Dev Fund
* A miner who can deliver 15-20K a day


[04/28/2020 10:25 PM] mx#5165
big miner doesn't give a shit about that miner who represents let`s say all small miners at the moment, at least people can buy anything


[04/28/2020 10:26 PM] mx#5165
small people won`t get better chance to invest than now


[04/28/2020 10:31 PM] mx#5165
EFYT holders while being behind with price at the same time pretty much know that they possibly couldn`t buy larger amounts in short term at existing price


[04/28/2020 10:35 PM] mx#5165
so everyone knows that Ergo tokens are too precious to give them away üôÇ


[04/28/2020 10:38 PM] kushti#0978
heh yes


[04/28/2020 10:38 PM] kushti#0978
also IOHK will come eventually I guess they're slow but still


[04/28/2020 10:40 PM] mx#5165
for sure they know power of Ergo


[04/28/2020 10:43 PM] mx#5165
centralized giants will be building now tracking apps and creating new models based on privacy, that will be another filter factor for many blockchains, finally a word decentralization will get a proper meaning


[04/28/2020 10:45 PM] kushti#0978
there're devs in IOHK willing to resign and work for Ergo )


[04/28/2020 10:45 PM] kushti#0978
but we can


[04/28/2020 10:45 PM] kushti#0978
t propose stable rewards


[04/28/2020 10:46 PM] kushti#0978
which is a bit scary


[04/28/2020 10:49 PM] mx#5165
scary would be if there was no treasury, as for decentralization of apps Ergo is on top, i can see revolution coming also to blockchains üôÇ


[04/28/2020 11:00 PM] mx#5165
all these kyc, regulations, lots of pos blockchain fans will have some problems and are confused for sure already while google, apple and fb will develop better in this category things by themselves, all announced the same things, privacy focus can be even more confusing for some blockchain creators üôÇ


[04/28/2020 11:05 PM] kushti#0978
so what if the selling miner will supply Emurgo and then Pantera with tokens for all 2020, small miners getting rewards from the pools coming will accumulate or sell providing liquidity, and EF will slowly provide liquidity for development and marketing efforts


[04/28/2020 11:06 PM] kushti#0978
sounds like win-win-win-win


[04/28/2020 11:08 PM] mx#5165
for now big guys are checking if you provide it for them as foundation, otherwise offering 5x price i would be buying on exchange already like crazy


[04/28/2020 11:09 PM] kushti#0978
heh yes but you can't buy 4M ergs on exchanges anyway


[04/28/2020 11:11 PM] kushti#0978
also may be big guys are in rush to get tokens before bullrun


[04/28/2020 11:12 PM] kushti#0978
especially if USD liquidity is cheap for them


[04/28/2020 11:13 PM] mx#5165
you are aware that weekly Bitcoin volume from 4 years is about 100k a week, if you remove fake volume from it, it will leave you with 10k of Bitcoin possible to buy


[04/28/2020 11:14 PM] kushti#0978
from 4 years ?


[04/28/2020 11:15 PM] mx#5165
yes weekly volume in Bitcoin from 4 years is about 100k Bitcoin a week


[04/28/2020 11:19 PM] mx#5165
industrial miners don`t provide liquidity, they never did


[04/28/2020 11:19 PM] kushti#0978
you mean from first 4 years?


[04/28/2020 11:22 PM] mx#5165
from first 4 years amount are much bigger, now it is almost impossible to buy big amount of Bitcoin


[04/28/2020 11:25 PM] mx#5165
if industrial miners would provide liqudity we would be literally at 2k-3k price at the moment so they don't do it


[04/28/2020 11:27 PM] mx#5165
their otc buyers are providing liquidity


[04/28/2020 11:29 PM] kushti#0978
hmm right


[04/28/2020 11:29 PM] kushti#0978
what OTC market around Ergo looks like  is an interesting question


[04/28/2020 11:32 PM] mx#5165
yes, guys like Pantera and Emurgo also don`t know yet that's why they are trying their chances through foundation, they could be also possibly checking if you are not the big miner, we shouldn't make things easy for them, i would make counter offer for 100k at proposed price by them simply telling that it is 20% of all existing foundation funds at the moment otherwise only exchanges left


[04/28/2020 11:37 PM] kushti#0978
Justin @Justin1000 had an idea of establishing an SPV for getting funds into buying from miners, like funds did with Grin


[04/28/2020 11:38 PM] kushti#0978
it seems the idea is going to be realized now


[04/28/2020 11:42 PM] mx#5165
sounds good, however in Ergo's case i doubt that industrial miner has problem with selling things


[04/28/2020 11:42 PM] mx#5165
looks like problems are creating the ones who want to buy

[04/29/2020 3:42 AM] Justin1000#9555
*Concerned still not on big exchange still not enough awareness of Ergo leading to concentration of coins in few big miners‚Äô hands at very attractive cost. I wish Charles and Sasha would get Ergo listed on Binance ASAP. I sent Kushti excel sheets I did a long time ago showing how much could be made by exchanges by listing Ergo and how undervalued Ergo is versus other PoW coins.


[04/29/2020 3:42 AM] Justin1000#9555
*Pantera: Seems like a prelim expression of interests. The chance of the deal being finalized is far below 100% in my opinion based on my experience dealing with private equity/venture funds. Also, unless you can find the big miners, then $3mm is completely undoable. Even $1mm is completely undoable. Therefore, the deal is undoable. Don‚Äôt think Pantera would bother coming in for $100-200k. Also, if they do, will they still be motivated to do the promotion and exchange listings? Maybe can propose smaller deal like 100k ERGS at lower price (20 cents or something I guess) IF they deliver the exchanges and promotion. That way, they put up little money but just gotta do some work to make that 100k Ergs worth something.


[04/29/2020 3:42 AM] Justin1000#9555
But obvious better solution would be to find just big miner(s) and try to arrange the sale of $1-3mm of Ergs at that price and then do it that way. Miners should be happy to sell at $0.77 I guess. BUT HUGE RISK DEAL JUST DOESN‚ÄôT HAPPEN. These funds like to put things down on paper that promise nothing so they can get to next step and you never know when/if will back out.


[04/29/2020 3:42 AM] Justin1000#9555
*Emurgo: Haven‚Äôt followed lately but always liked them. Don‚Äôt forget they are likely VERY rich as the guy and other people behind it made huge amounts of money on Cardano. This is relevant because if you give them a small deal, not sure get much from them in the end as they won‚Äôt be highly incentivized. 100k very small for them. Maybe 200k? 300k? All still relatively small but may incentivize them. IF they can secure Binance listing and potentially other top exchanges, seems worth it. And sale price secondary at this point ‚Äì urgency is getting the token price up on exchange and LOTS more awareness. Just based on little I know, I‚Äôm more confident Emurgo would follow through and close the deal once the key terms agreed compared to a US-based  VC Fund like Pantera!


[04/29/2020 3:42 AM] Justin1000#9555
*If you guys can‚Äôt get the miners to work with you then you only got the Foundation tokens. So get those into the hands of someone that is going to secure a Binance listing ASAP. #1 Priority!!!! Other than that, promotion but focus should be on that listing which should have happened already! Disappointed  Charles and Sasha haven‚Äôt long since delivered that!


[04/29/2020 10:36 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 
1) Charles and Sasha not  responsive even , they have a lot of problems with their projects I guess (Waves is not doing well, Cardano is postponing releases all the time).
2) Emurgo is huge , yes, they did Cardano's $60M ICO. Also they're friendly , moving fast and have good execution. Also willing to do DeFi projects on top of Ergo as Cardano is not ready. They also did Cardano Futures on Binance recently. However they said that listing will not be free if done through them. 
3) For Binance, we have an insider there, a top dev, he's a member of internal committee and can get enough votes it seems (quorum == listing, even free, rules are changed like daily there though it seems). 
4) Pantera's deal likely will not be finalized.


[04/29/2020 10:37 AM] kushti#0978
Will have another call with IOHK managers next week likely. But they're slow.


[04/29/2020 10:44 AM] kushti#0978
So it seems we're proposing to Emurgo to buy the supply from the miner, and proposing to Pantera to stay in the queue?  Or each buying 10K /day. Then no pressure on exchanges, Ergo likely going back to $.6-1, and EF is covering dev/marketing/listing expenses by selling the ergs ?


[04/29/2020 10:45 AM] kushti#0978
Also Emurgo would be like to have a representative in Dev Fund Board to have oversight over its spendings (to be sure no occasional dump will happen from the Dev Fund)


[04/29/2020 2:36 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
If I understand the Pantera INVESTMENT MEMORANDUM correctly, Pantera wants Ergo to become a Limited Partner of Pantera Capital. That means that Ergo has to first invest USDT50K into Pantera Capital Subscription! ("This involves the Project becoming a Limited Partner of the Fund, opening a capital account with the least sum being 50,000 USDT.") Or am I misunderstanding??

Seems to me that makes it a non-starter.


[04/29/2020 2:36 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Also, "ERGO is eligible for investment funding of 3,000,000 United States Dollars" the key word being "eligible". So Pantera is not obliged to invest a single cent and may not invest anything.
Also, "eight (8) months (within which ERGO is expected to, with the help of Pantera Capital, be listed on at least three (3) reputable Cryptocurrency Exchanges)".  Sounds bad to me. Not clear at all how Pantera would "help". Also I would rather see the burden of listing to be on Pantera, not on Ergo.

[04/29/2020 2:39 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
So yeah, I agree with @kushti "proposing to Pantera to stay in the queue" or similar.


[04/29/2020 7:04 PM] mx#5165
@kushti i can see Emurgo as top priority definitely, still wouldn't go with more than 200k at the moment assuming putting Pantera in queue which doesn`t look much helpful, so maybe 200k + some amount each month to reach their target


[04/30/2020 9:52 AM] kushti#0978
ok but are we selling or giving a grant ?


[04/30/2020 9:52 AM] kushti#0978
It seems they're waiting for the latter heh


[04/30/2020 9:52 AM] kushti#0978
maybe let's establish joint room with them


[04/30/2020 10:36 AM] mx#5165

[05/04/2020 2:19 PM] kushti#0978
EFYTs sent, spendings in EFYTs again under 20K / month

@mx @morphic @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ @Justin1000 let's reward contributors to 3.2.3 release : gtklocker , jasondavies , knizhnik , with 1-2K ergs each. I guess this would be a good step towards incentivization of development decentralization

Proposal from Emurgo, it seems they're still looking for a grant. Range of possibilities is wide though, and they're expecting an offer from us @mx @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ @Justin1000 @morphic


[05/08/2020 6:36 PM] kushti#0978
"Good news, we've  found a big number through an OTC desk who is  selling 400K ergs right now and also can deliver up to 20K daily per request (so up to 40% of generation). 
 
We are also in talks with some big players in the space (very well known in US/Europe/Japan) on implementing DeFi projects on top of Ergo (such as algo stablecoins). 
 
So I think to propose something like following;
1) Pantera is doing accumulation up to a certain point
2) Pantera's representative becomes a member of DevFund  to oversight its spendings.
3) Ergo team and Foundation, its partners and Pantera coordinating marketing and MM. 
 So at certain point from accumulation we're going to aggresive promotion, Also, via promotion in the miners community and improving efficiency of publicly available mining software production cost can be increased at a certain point. "

[05/08/2020 7:34 PM] mx#5165
@kushti looks like donating and selling at the same time could annoy them, 250k grant for all activities with making it clear how much of existing dev fund it is


[05/08/2020 7:41 PM] mx#5165
we can consider additional grant in the future, getting rid of all tokens while gaining such partnership is not an option i think


[05/08/2020 7:45 PM] kushti#0978
We need to choose what do we want also


[05/08/2020 7:46 PM] kushti#0978
so less grant means less things we're asking for


[05/08/2020 7:46 PM] kushti#0978
and would be good to have a joint deal


[05/08/2020 7:46 PM] kushti#0978
Emurgo/IOHK + Pantera


[05/08/2020 7:51 PM] mx#5165
any proposed amount of tokens is symbolic for them so i would offer 250k for everything they propose


[05/08/2020 7:59 PM] mx#5165
even 500k is not enough for any single thing the propose, they are aware of it


[05/08/2020 8:02 PM] mx#5165
IOHK is getting 100k


[05/10/2020 11:21 PM] kushti#0978
what do you guys think about adding bez to the Board? to lobby marketing team interests )


[05/11/2020 10:03 AM] Justin1000#9555
Regarding Emurgo, just my initial thoughts:
-Proposal looks exciting but a little short on details. Since you have had the conversations with them I leave it to you to judge how sincere they really are. They mention Yoroi is only expected to support a few crypto currencies so hopefully they are sincere in adding Ergo and dedicating a lot of effort to promotion etc.
-Giving them a grant of ~200-250k Ergs PLUS giving some access to the liquidity you found with the OTC miner so they can buy more Ergs to increase their exposure would be ideal -> more stake and ‚Äúskin-in-the-game‚Äù Emurgo has, the better. But then concern is managing that versus Pantera (Pantera may want to buy them all for example) 
-They could be more specific on timing and what they will do. Like what exchanges? Binance? Can they deliver? How and when? And more specifics on promotion ‚Äì it all looks good but its easy to draft up a seven page general doc like that. 
-Need to clarify when Ergs will be granted. If don‚Äôt have 100% confidence on Emurgo follow through, don‚Äôt want to just give them a lot of Ergs so zeroing down on details of what they will do when and insuring their SINCERITY is key -> Japanese usually very sincere about such things and agreements in my experience but are their senior leadership/founders also aware of this proposal and on-board with working on Ergo 100%? When will grant Ergs? Upon certain milestones or some agreement being signed?


[05/11/2020 10:03 AM] Justin1000#9555
Working with Emurgo would be great and could be powerful combination of Pantera and Emurgo if can balance all the interests. I would just recommend 1) Ironing out more details with Emurgo; 2) Confirming their 100% sincerity and dedication to Ergo if needed; 3) Consider if appropriate to test waters to see how Emurgo feels about Pantera -> happy to work together?; 4) Make sure they get what they want if are going to do partnership so if grant tokens alone not enough, then maybe give them opportunity to buy from OTC seller but need to be careful this doesn‚Äôt conflict with Pantera‚Äôs interests.


[05/11/2020 10:04 AM] Justin1000#9555
> any proposed amount of tokens is symbolic for them so i would offer 250k for everything they propose
@mx Agree. Offer them the 250k and ask for EVERYTHING PLUS anything MORE you might want from them!


[05/11/2020 9:04 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 right, the offer is very vague, but now they're waiting for some requests from us to start bargaining


[05/11/2020 9:32 PM] kushti#0978
It seems Emurgo is not doing MM , or guys I'm talking with not aware of that. They are not Japanese also but had a call with Kadamo-san.


[05/11/2020 9:34 PM] kushti#0978
So let's think about our needs. Not sure about their merketing machine. On exchanges, we'll pay for them anyway it seems. MM they are likely NOT doing. 
Thus what can we ask for is joint applications (Yoroi, algo stablecoins) + promotion among developers community (they're doing that for Cardano) + contacts (exchanges, funds etc)


[05/11/2020 9:46 PM] mx#5165
Yoroi and they are proposing DEX, I guess we can propose full fledged DEX with GUI + contacts


[05/11/2020 10:02 PM] kushti#0978
also algo stablecoin


[05/11/2020 10:02 PM] kushti#0978
so Yoroi + algo stablecoin + DEX ?


[05/11/2020 10:07 PM] mx#5165
DEX is the most extensive project i guess as it involves payment network protocols, gateways, swaps with different blockchains, wallet, GUI, specs is what matters in such deal if they accept also different projects then sure

Emurgo is aware of Cardano`s plans so other things should probably include privacy preserving ideas


[05/11/2020 10:39 PM] kushti#0978
which Cardano plans ? )


[05/11/2020 10:39 PM] kushti#0978
btw who's willing to talk with them ?


[05/11/2020 10:39 PM] kushti#0978
why its only me heh


[05/11/2020 10:41 PM] mx#5165
i mean Cardano's extended utxo model, i can talk but you know best what can be achieved with Ergo`s design, what i am saying is that we should discuss only full fledged things with them


[05/11/2020 10:44 PM] kushti#0978
yes


[05/12/2020 3:05 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Regarding Emurgo, I wonder if it would make sense to propose that for ERG granted to them for free, they would also  have to buy some proportion of additional ERG. For example, for a grant of  250K ERG they also have to buy 250K (or 125K ERG or  some other  fraction) of ERG at market price as of grant date. This would make them more invested in Ergo's success.  Maybe mention to them that so far, some of the big Ergo community members were early investors who bought EFYT at the then market prices AND put in a lot of their own time and efforts to help the platform.


[05/12/2020 3:06 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Anyhow, for normal private equity, private equity will put cash resources or buy capital for the startup, not just promises to help.


[05/12/2020 3:06 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Looks like their Chief Marketing Officer, Florian Bohnert, is quite interesting.

[05/12/2020 3:11 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
@kushti have you talked personally with their CMO Florian, of just CTO Nicolas? Seems like Florian might be the main guy who will make things happen if we reach agreement. If have not talked with him yet, I think you should try to  have a conversation (or conference call, I would be happy to join) specifically with Florian.


[05/12/2020 3:13 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
By this way we could find out is Florian personally even aware of Ergo? How much does he know about Ergo?


[05/12/2020 3:14 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I am worried of this possible scenario: Maybe the Emurgo proposal you got is mostly just cooked up by CTO Nicolas and the rest of Emurgo team is not yet  too aware of Ergo and/or not really on board.... and then once we agree with Nicolas and grant free ERG to them, only then would  Nicolas  try to sell it to Florian and others who may or may not be too interested. This would not be ideal!


[05/12/2020 3:16 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
So I think Ergo should first talk also at least with Florian and maybe a few other key people on Emurgo team (who else?) to see how sincere and interested they are.


[05/12/2020 3:17 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
And besides Florian, do they have someone else who is the lead person for exchange listings? I think we should definitely talk to him first as well.


[05/12/2020 3:18 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
...with the aim to first hear what they say. Are they aware of Ergo? How much do they know about Ergo? And then what ideas do they have for marketing and exchange listing?


[05/12/2020 3:19 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
And then I think ideally Emurgo and Ergo  come up with a mutual marketing and exchange listing Roadmap with milestones and target dates before any ERG are actually granted.


[05/12/2020 3:32 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
> why its only me heh
@kushti Let's try to schedule a conference call with their CMO Florian, yeah?


[05/12/2020 3:35 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I was about to add the Yoroi extention until I saw this! Yikes, no way I would add something like this! I think this would scare off a lot of users, no? Or is this common for web wallets (I don't have any web wallets or similar extensions so maybe this is normal and I'm just paranoid)?

"If we get tokens we would already have a lot of skin in the game, because the price that we normally get would be way more than what we get from the tokens. So for us to make this worth it, we would be working in bringing value to the ecosystem
5:36
We are going to be spending resources, putting our branding at stake (first blockchain to support besides Cardano), participating in the ecosystem, etc
5:37
I feel is enough skin in the game, and buying tokens for us is not an option, because that would be an investment."

"Perspective about prices:

    Just Yoroi (Desktop + Mobile) development is over 400kUSD in development. We also need to do the integration.
    Exposure to 100k+ users in Yoroi
    Partnerships and helping with adoption for example yesterday I talked to eToro and they would be open to add Ergo to their eToroX platform ‚Äî this would also include market makers
    and the other stuff that I put in the document"


[05/12/2020 4:33 PM] Justin1000#9555
Well that is great then as long as they are serious which seems so. If have doubts about full dedication and sincerity though, still good to talk to more top guys of Emurgo to confirm. But yeah...based on above is great! Kinda surprised they don't seek the opportunity to buy more Ergs now at a attractive price in addition to the grant but is their call.

We should try to use the Emurgo~Ergo Cooperation Announcment (assuming it happens) to make a coordinated price pump.


[05/17/2020 5:53 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
We can talk with Florian about it, hopefully they can help do a price pump on the news.


[05/17/2020 5:54 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
As per a post I made few months ago...


[05/17/2020 5:55 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
As I understand, what a lot of the other coins do is an announcement like the above which is immediately followed by a price pump for the token in the market. Initially, the price pump might need some help, but this can be orchestrated with market making.

Once this happens, then KOL‚Äôs and traders become interested. Why? They see the relationship:
Partnership/use case announcement --> price pump
A delicious pattern which can be repeated in the future, and at greater and greater magnitudes.

So after the first Ergo partnership announcement, some KOLs/traders become interested (especially if there is follow up contacting them from the community) and acquire ERG.
Then another 3rd party use case is announced followed by another price pump.
**But this time the KOLS/traders will be anxious to help promote and so the price pump is not dependent on market making.

And a virtuous cycle is triggered.

@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ @Justin1000 had a call with bez today,  he will be on the call tomorrow and also doing trading and participate in some whales communities.
He's proposing to combine Bittrex listing and Emurgo announcement , prepare with showing some trading signals before (few little occasional spikes) and proper shilling, then with the listing and announcement the price will  grow.
With Emurgo partnerships a lot of Cardanians will come to the community and also to buy, but there's no decent exchange still (

Can you get Gary to do Chinese translation of the press release? We should aim to get English and Chinese press releases out on the same day.


[05/18/2020 4:25 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
And I think we should also do a Chinese paid ad or two  in WeChat on same day as the press release.


[05/18/2020 4:27 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I propose we do two separate press releases for Bitrex listing and Emurgo partnership, spaced by at least a few days. ERG gets some price bounce on the first announcement, and then another bounce on the second announcement, ideally something like this....

[05/18/2020 4:34 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
So in Y weeks from now, when there is another big Ergo announcement, traders will internet search for historical  Ergo news announcements. They will see that X days after Emurgo partnership announcement, ERG price increased xx%... and same for Bitrex announcement.


[05/18/2020 4:34 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Then MORE traders will buy on the news.


[05/18/2020 4:36 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
So spacing these two Bitrex and Emurgo announcements should (I hope) have that same effect. Announce on same day and we blow our load all in one shot, waste of announcement.


[05/18/2020 4:37 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Just my thoughts. I'm also ok with announcing Bitrex and Emurgo as joint press release.

[05/18/2020 11:13 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Sounds good to me. I take it that Florian does not need  get too  familiar or deep understanding of Ergo (or any coin). He leaves that to the tech guys. And Florian  just runs the Emurgo marketing "machine".


[05/18/2020 11:13 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Notes from Call with Florian.

Expect can make Emurgo-Ergo news announcement in 2-4 weeks.

They (not just Florian, different Emurgo guys) have good relationships with a number of exchanges. Are talking with Binance (presumably in general, not about Ergo). ‚ÄúPretty sure we can help‚Äù with exchange listings (although not specified which).

Better to separate news announcements rather than combine.  ‚Äúmilk each announcement‚Äù as much as possible.

Emurgo marketing ‚Äúis a Machine‚Äù. Feed in the main Ergo narrative and it gets distributed across their channels.

They already have ideas on how to create the Ergo narrative (Sebastion and Robert are tech guys who are good at describing things for mass audience). 

Ergo must be presented in a way that will also appeal to Cardano holders (how will Ergo benefit Cardano?); Florian says he has ideas on how to do this (although we did not discuss what).

Expects Ergo might need to spend another US$2-3K / month for maybe 3-4 months for additional marketing. This would be very targeted marketing though that is extension of the the Emurgo Marketing Machine.

The Emurgo marketing Machine does not extend into China, but Florian personally has some contacts and could ask and find a China agency within a day.

[05/19/2020 8:59 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I used to follow notsofast in 2017. He used to pump a lot of shitcoins, presumably after mining a lot for himself. My guess is he is mining ERG and just accumulating.


[05/19/2020 9:00 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Maybe he is happy to just continue mining and accumulating. Waiting for the next crypto bull market and then he'll pump ERG. I have no contact with him, so this is just pure speculation.


[05/19/2020 9:00 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674

What is his opinion of Ergo?


[05/19/2020 9:03 AM] mx#5165
for me that whole group looked like being pushed away at start by bigger miners, they still managed to mine nice amounts as far i remember so they have pretty heavy rigs especially when used standard miners


[05/19/2020 9:15 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I wonder if they are selling or accumulating the ERG they've mined.


[05/19/2020 9:19 AM] mx#5165
their promo was very short so i guess they quit mining with first otcs done, basically any small miner was scared away so i guess now it is right moment for them but to join through standard accumulation as we don`t see for sure full of capabilities of our existing miners especially when they didn't sell anything from the start


[05/19/2020 9:20 AM] mx#5165

1. We need to have a legal opinion from Liechtenstein . Could be about $8-10K
2. They will evaluate our project. They want for an integration to bring $250+K. They are getting numbers by tracking social activity, trading volumes on existing exchanges and so on. We can always compensate difference (so pay up to $250+K).
3. Integration & legal investigation can be done in parallel. But they claim they have about 70 tokens in the queue.

@kushti which announcement you mean? to release Emurgo`s already? i am pretty sure that announcement itself will reach whole crypto space, i also suspect whales from Emurgo are the ones accumulating now


[05/23/2020 7:02 PM] mx#5165
in this case i would rather release ann as agreed in June


[05/23/2020 7:11 PM] mx#5165
"10. Is the token/coin a security or otherwise a regulated product or instrument under U.S. federal securities law or the laws of any other (non-U.S.) jurisdiction(s)? *
If Yes, please tick Yes and also specify jurisdictions in "Other" below. Please note that Binance will not be able to process your application if your token/coin is a security.

[05/23/2020 7:12 PM] mx#5165
as for me, looks like two opinions are needed now


[05/23/2020 7:13 PM] mx#5165
Binance


[05/23/2020 7:14 PM] mx#5165
I think after official partnership, we should try reaching exchanges through Emurgo guys, they will have interest in it also, especially when they see where Ergo is listed


[05/23/2020 7:15 PM] mx#5165
I believe they are responsible for Cardano`s listing


[05/23/2020 7:28 PM] mx#5165
Hopefully we will be able to extend partnership in time to full range


[05/23/2020 8:09 PM] kushti#0978
Emurgo going to connect us with eToroX


[05/23/2020 8:12 PM] mx#5165
Yes, I believe they can do the same with eToro but not yet


[05/23/2020 8:15 PM] kushti#0978
eToro is for cryptos also ?


[05/23/2020 8:16 PM] mx#5165
yes


[05/23/2020 8:18 PM] mx#5165
it is one of the biggest volume generators but it doesn`t provide any stats about it üôÇ


[05/23/2020 8:25 PM] mx#5165
but only like top 20 coins are listed there


[05/25/2020 5:06 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
‚ÄúIt will also cover the full integration & support of Ergo‚Äôs native blockchain token (Erg) into Yoroi
Wallet -‚Äù


[05/25/2020 5:06 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
This is good, they put it in the announcement. Makes me feel more confident that ERG actually gets into Yoroi.


[05/25/2020 5:08 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
‚Äúthis partnership allows for deeper research & specifically tailored solutions development using the
underlying privacy already embedded into Ergo‚Äôs smart contracts which are interoperable with
Cardano‚Äôs network.‚Äù


[05/25/2020 5:09 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Ergo‚Äôs smart contracts are interoperable with Cardano‚Äôs networkÔºü


[05/25/2020 5:09 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
‚ÄúThis will in turn, offer enterprises the flexibility to on-ramp onto larger
blockchain ecosystems such as Cardano or any of its interoperable systems such as Ergo.‚Äù


[05/25/2020 5:10 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I guess this is what Florian meant by how to present Ergo to the Cardano community in a way that answers "how does it benefit Cardano".


[05/25/2020 5:15 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
What do you guys think of this as the message?  For me I think it's fine. Makes Ergo sound non-threatening, as if Ergo is a supplement for Cardano.


[05/25/2020 5:15 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Could let Ergo enter in as a sleeper.


[05/25/2020 8:38 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
> @kushti Regarding Opinion from Liechtenstein,  we should try to get them to accept the one from last Sept from Dentons Rodyk.


[05/25/2020 8:39 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Of course its not from Liechtenstein, but it was from a good  law firm and should be accepted most everywhere.


[05/25/2020 8:40 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
We should at least try using that.


[05/25/2020 8:45 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
> But anyhow if Bitrex has "about 70 tokens in the queue.", and they only list a handful (3?) a week, we could be looking at around another 6 months.


[05/25/2020 8:48 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I would feel nervous about Ergo  paying US$8-10K now to be in a que for a listing not till  around 6 months from now.

[05/26/2020 2:54 AM] Justin1000#9555
Liechtenstein could certainly be an exception but when we got the original opinion from Dentons they said their opinions were accepted in most places around the world no problem even tho no with focus on Singapore law. Remember that we paid a lot for it and Dentons is a good firm! So should definitely try to get Bittrex to accept that send it to them if haven't already.


[05/26/2020 2:56 AM] Justin1000#9555
Also, seems to me, worst case bittrex still insists on an opinion when talking with the Liechtenstein firm should ask them to reduce the quote as much as possible and share with them the Denton's opinion. Hopefully will reduce the cost or increase the speed of getting the opinion at least.


[05/26/2020 2:59 AM] Justin1000#9555
> draft of Emurgo partnership PR
@kushti Took a read through and seems good. I guess one minor thing is to mention specifically in the announcement that Ergo is intended to be the FIRST non-Cardano cryptocurrency integrated into Yoroi if that is indeed the case. Better narrative

{Reactions}
‚òëÔ∏è 

[05/26/2020 3:00 AM] Justin1000#9555
With that announcement and promotion, obviously the biggest missing thing is a great exchange listing or two


[05/26/2020 3:01 AM] Justin1000#9555
After all the news comes out, I can try another push with Bitfinex. But can't be too hopeful as they weren't very responsible to former requests but worth a try.


[05/26/2020 10:14 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 good point about FIRST non-Cardano CC. And please contact Finex guys, maybe even now, you can show them the announcement.


[05/26/2020 10:16 AM] kushti#0978
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ @Justin1000 ok will ask Bittrex on Singaporean opinion. The guy told me that Liechtenstein works only though but lets make another pass


[05/26/2020 10:16 AM] kushti#0978
What exchanges can we try again ?


[05/28/2020 5:08 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ @mx talking with Liquid(Japanese one), BigOne and BiBox now . It seems we have some connections with BitHumb and Korbit also.


[05/28/2020 5:08 PM] mx#5165
nice, they should accept opinion from Singapore


[05/29/2020 6:17 AM] Justin1000#9555
This opinion is based on Sing law but we asked around before (I specifically remember asking at least 2 exchanges) and they all said would accept it no problem even though their jurisdiction was not Singapore. Also some other guy who knew a lot about it and said was accepted pretty much everywhere but probably must be exceptions


[05/29/2020 6:27 AM] Justin1000#9555
> @Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ @mx talking with Liquid(Japanese one), BigOne and BiBox now . It seems we have some connections with BitHumb and Korbit also.
@kushti 1) Any discussions with Gate.io? I think we applied 2x already.  For me they were top choice for exchange outside Top 3 (Gate.io is top 10 and probable bigger than Bittrex). 2) Bithumb...dunno Korea situation...but they are #2 of total volume globally on BTI.live -> maybe Probit and Emurgo can make suggestion?  „ÄÇ„ÄÇ„ÄÇAh I see you are already working on it.  3) Bitmart guy message me. They moved to Shanghai. I think they will be a smaller exchange, probably lots of fake volume but will check in with him anyway (said have "reduced requirements for listing")


[05/29/2020 6:32 AM] kushti#0978
BitMart recently contacted me, asked for 4 BTC


[05/29/2020 6:33 AM] Justin1000#9555
Oh...can't recall details on that exchange but 4 BTC probably way to high given our budget.


[05/29/2020 6:34 AM] Justin1000#9555
Need a breakthrough to a Top 10 exchange. Adding more 2nd and 3rd tier exchanges pretty small benefit.

üëç 

[05/29/2020 7:25 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 yeah. Just had a call w. BiBox guy, is this exchange any good these days?


[05/29/2020 7:25 AM] kushti#0978
CMC changed ratings, now they're sorting by webtraffic


[05/29/2020 7:25 AM] kushti#0978
and BiBox is not looking good


[05/29/2020 7:25 AM] kushti#0978
in that rating


[05/29/2020 10:56 AM] Justin1000#9555
Bibox used to be one of our very top targets. Think we applied at least 2x already. They were around top 10 then but last I looked which was some time ago they were falling in rankings. Dont see them on bti.live at moment. Guess need to do a little more research tho


[06/02/2020 4:23 PM] kushti#0978
Emurgo announcement is on June, 9th, likely

@kushti I don't know any crypto funds. Would they even be interested when ERG not yet listed on a decent exchange? I would guess no, but I have not talked with any of them so not sure.

@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ well, they would like to come earlier than mass traders, so I do not see a problem here


[06/10/2020 9:49 AM] kushti#0978
usually they can help with the exchanges


[06/10/2020 9:59 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Ah, I see. What kind of deal or offer do you have in mind? Crypto fund buys (or is granted) some ERG in exchange for marketing and exchange listing efforts for Ergo?


[06/10/2020 9:59 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
(similar to Emurgo - Ergo deal).


[06/10/2020 10:04 AM] mx#5165
i think that should be next part of partnership with Emurgo in some time, otherwise we will spend probably lots on random mms from exchanges


[06/10/2020 10:06 AM] mx#5165
with each step price should be increasing and there should be less tokens needed for next phase


[06/10/2020 10:06 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674

@mx yes let's try to use Emurgo as much as possible before selling or givng precious and now super undervalued ERG to any new crypto funds.


[06/10/2020 10:08 AM] mx#5165
in case of exchanges talks, i think we should wait at least a month, maybe they will propose something in the meantime also, they should care about listings as well


[06/10/2020 10:08 AM] kushti#0978
I guess funds should buy from miners (still possible) and then do proper MM with defining accumulating levels, breakthrough patterns etc


[06/10/2020 10:08 AM] kushti#0978
with professional MM traders will come

[06/11/2020 8:16 PM] kushti#0978
but lets not rely on anyone


[06/11/2020 8:17 PM] kushti#0978
so what can we do ?


[06/11/2020 8:18 PM] kushti#0978
we are getting on Sistemkoin (small exchange, but just giveaway to their users), Atomars  for $800 (half to be paid in ergs)


[06/11/2020 8:18 PM] kushti#0978
will update on Binance DEX


[06/11/2020 8:19 PM] kushti#0978
could be good to get on CoinEx IMHO, likely much cheaper, also no worse than MXC maybe even


[06/11/2020 8:22 PM] mx#5165
we can`t control listing or volume pretty much, in case of exchanges i guess we could rely on Emurgo, probably IOHK will just contact Emurgo


[06/11/2020 8:23 PM] mx#5165
like i said i would still delay next level of partnership for at least a month


[06/11/2020 8:26 PM] mx#5165
so it will be pretty much big exchange for significant amount of tokens as their mms will do the rest


[06/11/2020 8:26 PM] kushti#0978

[06/11/2020 8:26 PM] kushti#0978
Emurgo is not doing MM it claims


[06/11/2020 8:26 PM] kushti#0978
IOHK is doing likely


[06/11/2020 8:27 PM] kushti#0978
also Cardano Foundation


[06/11/2020 8:27 PM] mx#5165
so we will need probably grants for both in this case


[06/11/2020 8:29 PM] mx#5165
to achieve desired effect of big exchange and volume


[06/11/2020 8:56 PM] kushti#0978
IOHK is going to launch a PoW coin btw (confidential info heh)


[06/11/2020 8:57 PM] kushti#0978
so likely they're considering MM anyway


[06/11/2020 9:00 PM] mx#5165
by looking at their research history, i was expecting this coming


[06/11/2020 9:02 PM] mx#5165

[06/11/2020 9:03 PM] mx#5165
also good for PoW model as a whole


[06/11/2020 9:04 PM] kushti#0978
I'm not sure it will support nipopow heh


[06/11/2020 9:05 PM] kushti#0978
probably not


[06/11/2020 9:05 PM] kushti#0978
it will use EVM also likely


[06/11/2020 9:06 PM] mx#5165
that`s for sure, they mention it from 2018


[06/11/2020 9:07 PM] mx#5165
nipopow is still good for Ergo

[06/18/2020 12:19 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
...but that would mean his mining cost is above current market price of ERG (just under 3K sats), right?


[06/18/2020 2:26 PM] kushti#0978
"when we was mining at scale we was using public
but with diff we did a bit better miner for amd professional lineup gpus
issue is we dont have any big amount of those
and buying them is really a pain to pay 2-3k$ per board"


[06/18/2020 2:27 PM] kushti#0978
they mined like 3 months ago mostly


[06/18/2020 2:27 PM] kushti#0978
"production cost ? if you mean mining there is nothing like "production cost"
you can put your hardware anywhere you want
but your production cost is:
best profit coin /  amount of ergo coins
so if you say mining on vega 64 your best coin will be nimiq coin"


[06/18/2020 2:28 PM] kushti#0978
"i mean production cost of ergo is not that much about ergo
but more about gpu mining market situation
nimiq mining is 1.5-1.6$/day vega64
with 160-170w"

"Dear Ergo board members,

I would like to do a study on this Idea specified in the forum. I understand that the idea has some problems but generally, I'd like to implement a user-friendly endpoint/cli/app for collective signing which may need some studying at first. I'd like to know if such a work is something that Devs care about at this moment and if it would be supported.

I have experience participating in Ergo projects but I'd like to stay anonymous for now."

@kushti Would this stablecoin run on top of Ergo or Cardano, or both?


[07/08/2020 10:24 AM] kushti#0978
Eventually, both


[07/08/2020 10:24 AM] kushti#0978

[07/08/2020 4:17 PM] mx#5165

He is probably the largest Altcoin whale in china as far as I know"

Got this from a guy working in Asian exchange / OTC desk


[07/12/2020 11:47 AM] kushti#0978
The whale is willing to buy ergs for 5-10 BTC for starters


[07/12/2020 11:49 AM] kushti#0978
We need to discuss can/how EF/DevFund be involved in OTC / marketmaking etc


[07/12/2020 11:49 AM] kushti#0978
Another question is about hedging around BTC DF has


[07/12/2020 11:50 AM] kushti#0978
E.g. do we convert into USDT @ some price to minimize volatility-related risks etc


[07/12/2020 7:20 PM] mx#5165
looks like standard guy who should buy on exchange


[07/12/2020 7:23 PM] mx#5165
marketmaking yes, mm with bigger amount only possible with grants i would say, we can consider grants to some solid exchanges


[07/12/2020 7:26 PM] mx#5165
eventually tell him we can award a grant for listing on exchange and market making


[07/12/2020 7:28 PM] kushti#0978
Whale guy ?


[07/12/2020 7:29 PM] mx#5165
what whale guy? whale guy usually has above 10000 BTC, the best price we can get is on exchanges for salaries etc, for hedging strategies there is still lots of time


[07/12/2020 7:34 PM] kushti#0978
I meant: "eventually tell him we can award a grant for listing on exchange and market making" - tell to whom ?


[07/12/2020 7:36 PM] mx#5165
yes to the man willing to buy


[07/13/2020 10:23 AM] kushti#0978
Also, is DF selling ergs ?


[07/13/2020 10:23 AM] kushti#0978
Or will sell at some level ?


[07/13/2020 7:33 PM] mx#5165
it should always sell to have funds for core development


[07/13/2020 7:35 PM] mx#5165
but i think it is better to do it on exchanges with existing requirements


[07/14/2020 10:50 AM] kushti#0978
ok but who will do that and how?


[07/14/2020 10:50 AM] kushti#0978
No procedure is set, previous deals were OTC


[07/14/2020 8:00 PM] mx#5165
now liquidity and available tokens look like enough to do it on exchanges, procedure starts with people having access to funds, next step is sending to exchange and setting sell order, two weeks before salary should be fine


[07/14/2020 8:18 PM] kushti#0978
true


[07/14/2020 8:19 PM] kushti#0978
I also have access to catena's bots, so can try to provide liquidity with them


[07/14/2020 8:19 PM] kushti#0978
actually turned them on from ProBit's ERG/BTC pair today with my personal funds


[07/14/2020 8:20 PM] kushti#0978
on price being increased the bot should earn more than with just sell


[07/14/2020 8:20 PM] kushti#0978
let's see


[07/14/2020 8:20 PM] kushti#0978
however, I would like to pass control over all this stuff )


[07/14/2020 8:20 PM] kushti#0978

if they work also on waves then we should probably turn it on also by foundation funds not personal ones

especially when waves bots(liquid) were considered worse than catena`s bots


[07/14/2020 8:35 PM] mx#5165
control all over this stuff should be done by tether market makers who we avoid like hell because of own bots


[07/14/2020 8:37 PM] kushti#0978
you can loose BTC is ERG/BTC price is going down )


[07/14/2020 8:37 PM] kushti#0978
Also, bots are very limited actually


[07/14/2020 8:37 PM] kushti#0978
Professional MM tools allow for much more I suppose


[07/14/2020 8:38 PM] kushti#0978
With catena's bots hard to get how much was accumulated at what price for example


[07/14/2020 8:41 PM] mx#5165
for sure, i wouldn`t dare also to challenge tether market makers with their control over exchanges, even if i would have 30000 BTC from the ico i wouldn't do it like some do and end badly while trading top coins to gain more BTC


[07/14/2020 8:42 PM] mx#5165

[07/14/2020 9:54 PM] mx#5165
üôÇ mentions in cointelegraph should be doable by him, he is writing articles there, also cryptoglobe, tutorials on cryptocompare, newsletter to few k of their subscribers, otherwise paid articles in cointelegraph is like impossible thing for EF at the moment also it will include "PAID" mention, i know pretty much what waves guys will propose but i would reject it by myself as they should be doing it now already, trying to motivate them some at the moment


[07/14/2020 9:57 PM] mx#5165

Another thing which is coming ( @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ proposed it, but now it is coming into action ) is about hodlers-influencers. E.g. Gains did good work recently, and Alexandre is holding, Gigamesh also bought some, etc.


[07/15/2020 7:38 PM] mx#5165
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ can also use again the man from Weibo for social exposure among crypto audience in China, for 10 days it will cost 1500 USD, for single event 300 USD, other forms of marketing are limited at the moment there


[07/20/2020 11:59 AM] mx#5165
no sign of anything from anyone above the service mentioned from Noah but looks like you are talking with Bez already @kushti


[07/20/2020 12:17 PM] kushti#0978
@mx we discussed some marketing stuff on Saturday


[07/20/2020 12:19 PM] mx#5165
any additional interesting things proposed?


[07/20/2020 5:36 PM] kushti#0978
@mx not much, bez was on vacation and it seems for now (July), we need to revamp Marketing 101 just


[07/20/2020 5:37 PM] kushti#0978
and then in August stablecoin / Yoroi


[07/20/2020 5:37 PM] kushti#0978
community becomes much more active


[07/20/2020 5:37 PM] kushti#0978
we need to use it


[07/20/2020 5:37 PM] kushti#0978
to become really community-driven


[07/20/2020 5:37 PM] kushti#0978
finally


[07/20/2020 5:45 PM] mx#5165
yes, that would be good revamp with more active community, won`t be easy without additional developers but looks like some other people are back now and new from Cardano coming at the same time, Bez and ergonauts looks like will push some more activity on social media, will do probably infographic with roadmap etc, some article but still if nothing additional is proposed till the end of month i think we should support marketing through Emurgo directly


[07/20/2020 5:53 PM] mx#5165
with keeping what we have now


[07/20/2020 6:59 PM] kushti#0978
What could marketing through Emurgo directly be about ?


[07/20/2020 7:34 PM] kushti#0978
Emurgo is planning to do some oracle pools promotion


[07/20/2020 7:35 PM] kushti#0978
Along with PoC implementation release


[07/20/2020 7:35 PM] kushti#0978
in August


[07/20/2020 9:09 PM] mx#5165
things from their proposal, could be also single nice exchange i guess but as you mentioned, it would require probably grant to both Cardano and Emurgo


[07/20/2020 9:41 PM] kushti#0978
to get on a big exchange?


[07/20/2020 9:41 PM] kushti#0978
they can connect


[07/20/2020 9:41 PM] kushti#0978
but no more


[07/20/2020 10:09 PM] mx#5165
yeah, you got this reply from both or just Emurgo?


[07/20/2020 11:22 PM] kushti#0978
what do you mean?


[07/20/2020 11:23 PM] kushti#0978
they haven't provided any valuable connections yet


[07/20/2020 11:23 PM] kushti#0978
time to ask for them likely


[07/20/2020 11:38 PM] mx#5165
as far i remember you said that Emurgo provides connections and Cardano market makers


[07/20/2020 11:39 PM] mx#5165
so in this case i would ask and provide grant to both if there is some occassion


[07/20/2020 11:43 PM] mx#5165
for big exchange


[07/21/2020 11:17 AM] kushti#0978
IOHK is doing MM likely


[07/21/2020 11:17 AM] kushti#0978
Emurgo not


[07/21/2020 11:18 AM] kushti#0978
Emurgo can provide connections w. exchanges for free


[07/21/2020 11:18 AM] kushti#0978
But then we need to pay for listing anyway


[07/21/2020 11:19 AM] kushti#0978
So maybe better to continue community-building and Tier2 exchanges for now


[07/21/2020 11:24 AM] mx#5165
ok, looks like we will need still to pay for tier1 someday but maybe there will be better times then


[07/21/2020 11:27 AM] kushti#0978
also, we'll pay much less after tier2 listings and better situation with liquidity


[07/21/2020 11:29 AM] mx#5165
did coinex mention something about mm?


[07/21/2020 11:30 AM] kushti#0978
it will be done by us it seems

How much he is asking?

[08/20/2020 7:59 PM] Robert K#0722
I was thinking that maybe rebranding it as a Zero Knowledge Treasury protocol could be a good angle that could get press.


[08/20/2020 8:00 PM] Robert K#0722
And we could leave the next steps to be open, saying that further research will be done to expand and build upon this work to build out ZK DAOs as well which would get some good marketing hype imo.

[08/20/2020 11:51 PM] Robert K#0722
Which is great. I'd be happy to have some introductory material finally available.


[08/20/2020 11:52 PM] kushti#0978
Yes, very much needed


[08/20/2020 11:52 PM] Robert K#0722
ZK Treasury is also a feature that Cardano cannot copy for example.


[08/20/2020 11:53 PM] Robert K#0722
And so if we can push this kind of branding/make it more known, then it will be a good point to attract more new comers as well.


[08/20/2020 11:54 PM] kushti#0978
Well, yes, non-interactive mixer and ZK treasury are unique things


[08/20/2020 11:54 PM] kushti#0978

I asked him to create a test/mock introuction video to see how well he speaks on camera, which he'll send to me by Monday.


[08/21/2020 4:22 PM] Robert K#0722
In regards to the grant for running the ErgoCast, how much would we be willing to provide per month? Was it 500 Ergs previously when I proposed? (I forget specifically)


[08/21/2020 9:04 PM] mx#5165
"Initial Expenses

Wordpress theme to speed up website creation [94 Erg]
Purchasing HD webcam/recording kit for better video quality [260 Erg]
Paying for an artist to create a podcast cover art on Fiverr [50 Erg]
Doing all research + setup of the website, podcast infrastructure, branding, design, planning, ‚Ä¶ [2500 Erg]
Total: 2904 Erg

Recurring Expenses

Domain name (ergocast.io) [8 Erg/month]
Web hosting + storage (AWS t3a.small instance to start) [30 Erg/month to start]
Preparing episodes, finding guests, recording + editing + releasing episodes, providing show notes/resource links with episodes, upkeeping the website/all related platforms [1000 Erg/Month]
Total: 1038 Erg/Month"


[08/21/2020 9:09 PM] Robert K#0722
I'll probably still host the site/domain for the rest of the year and help the new host get started for the first couple episodes. 

Would we like to offer 750 Erg/Month for the host at the start then? Or would we like to cap it to a USD value so as Erg increases in value we scale back the total amount?


[08/21/2020 9:29 PM] mx#5165
These services are usually capped in USD, maybe better to hear some proposal first from the host

This would be great if we can have someone pick up the ErgoCast! 
Yes let's wait and see how he comes across on video.
Krannel might be willing to do the first episode or two for free since 1) he's a student so just the experience will likely be valuable for him; 2) Robert will "help him get started for the first couple episodes" especially since he does not have streaming/podcasting experience. 
But even so it is probably good to have a specific compensation number agreed upon at the start in order to avoid mismatch of expectations.

[08/24/2020 2:36 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
ErgoCast would be what frequency or how many per month?


[08/24/2020 2:37 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
@Robert K  maybe you might want to ask in Telegram Ergonauts if anyone is up to hosting ErgoCast, maybe find someone even more qualified? Or maybe not since it would be good to also bring someone new (Krannel) to the Ergo community. Just a thought.


[08/24/2020 2:09 PM] kushti#0978
I imagine from Ergonauts only Lawrence maybe would be interested in that atm.


[08/24/2020 2:10 PM] kushti#0978
got a video w. Krannel to check


[08/24/2020 2:32 PM] Robert K#0722
I think initially starting at 1/month is probably good to get started and make sure it goes well.


[08/24/2020 2:33 PM] Robert K#0722
And yeah, not a bad idea to make it like an "internship" for the first episode or two, and then payout on an agreed specific compensation.

[08/24/2020 9:33 PM] Robert K#0722
Imo his english appears to be good overall, though he does have a bit of an accent which may be a bit harder for some audiences to understand. He seems to have done a little bit of research and gathered a bunch of different topics from the ecosystem for this test video, so he seems willing to put in a bit of work.


[08/24/2020 9:34 PM] Robert K#0722
And he's studying computer science so he's more technical than the average crypto podcast host from what I've seen, so that's a good plus.


[08/24/2020 9:40 PM] Robert K#0722
Admittedly he didn't quite explain ErgoTree right, though I imagine having core devs on to fill in the blanks should work just fine.


[08/24/2020 9:43 PM] Robert K#0722
Someone else showed interest in potentially hosting the podcast, but haven't heard back from anyone else.


[08/24/2020 9:47 PM] Robert K#0722
I'm thinking maybe having him shoot a test episode with me could be a good first trial? The topic could be oracle pools, and we set the episode recording for mid-September. We ask him to read all the research/check out the repos and prepare a full episode worth of content/questions. I'll just join/act as a standard guest, and it'll be up to him to lead the whole conversation, and then do the editing afterwards. We can use this as a test, and if it goes well we could post it, else I still have control of the channels and we simply won't post it.

Repeating this here: Nico (CTO of Emurgo) suggested that we do an Ergo Cast episode with me + him + Sebastien (head of Cardano/manager of Yoroi) when Yoroi is released (hopefully within the next month if something doesn't break catastrophically in Cardano).


[08/27/2020 10:19 PM] Robert K#0722
And in regards to this, I was thinking that maybe I can stay on as a host, and Ollie/Krannel/Sakata could be my co-host? My major issue with staying on as host was originally that I just don't have time to get everything prepared/edited/uploaded, but I can generally spare an hour or two a month to hop on a call and co-host it with Sakata.


[08/27/2020 10:21 PM] Robert K#0722
If he deals with all the leg work of getting everything set up, then I can likely stay on and it should be more lively/interesting with 2 hosts versus just one.

Jun KaiToday at 18:02
Thanks
kushti said I need to talk to you to discuss payment etc for full time work at Ergo
Can you tell me when you will have time to discuss this ?
mxToday at 18:34
Hello, proposals usually go first through foundation voting, what is exactly your topic of interest and things you would like to work on?
Jun KaiToday at 18:36
I would like to work on sigma-rust first
and then move forward with other dapps or something that I can work on.
mxToday at 18:37
Do you have anything specific in mind or just improving sigma-rust implementation? can you share some of your past experience and expected salary?
Jun KaiToday at 18:40
yeah
My CV is ok ?
mxToday at 18:40

My regular expectation salary is $7-8k USD per month.
And I want to work on everything that I can do with JS, rust, golang.
kushti said it might be a good idea to work on sigma-rust first as I am familiar with rust.
And I have created first proposal to update README for sigma-rust
and had discussion with @greenhat
mxToday at 18:46
ok so i think we have enough details now to form some proposal for foundation, unless you have anything more to add?
Jun KaiToday at 18:46
I think I have told what I wanted to say üôÇ
I also have connection with other guys at foundation and kushti and others might know what I can do as well.
mxToday at 18:47
ok thanks
Jun KaiToday at 18:47
you are welcome

[08/31/2020 5:53 PM] Robert K#0722
Eh, imo that is a lot of money for someone completely new to the ecosystem, has never done anything realted to UTXOs based on his CV, and has primarily just done stuff around wallets rather than actual dApp development.


[08/31/2020 7:26 PM] morphic#4133
The problem of the resume is that it includes almost everything. The experience is very diverse, which suggests the knowledge and skills are not very deep (considering 5 years of total experience). Hardly suitable for core development. Primary expertise is also hard to estimate. So doesn't look like a resume for $7-8k per month. 
He also gives some urls to the open source work, but they don't contain program code almost. Mostly documentation, configuration, and fixes here and there. 
I'm not sure why he consider this as development contributions.


[09/01/2020 1:15 AM] kushti#0978
From CV, he's likely mostly in JS / HTML / SDKs so unlikely can do solid things around the core


[09/01/2020 1:15 AM] kushti#0978
Can we consider some trial tasks though ?


[09/04/2020 10:01 PM] mx#5165
sure, would require some specific tasks with price for it if there is some help needed at the moment, or some new dapp at least or new task that is on list but can be delayed heavily by other work, otherwise $7-8k for some non specified work doesn`t bring anything


[09/04/2020 11:08 PM] kushti#0978
yeah, agree


[09/10/2020 11:25 PM] kushti#0978
now Jun Kai is okay with $5K / month, but I don't see any motivation beyond money

Hello, your proposal was rejected through voting in this form, but there could be some trial tasks considered in the form of grants, usually comunity members or devs propose tasks like for example Ledger implementation, needed time and price for it

I'm talking with Marek about potentially giving him a grant to create a streamlined setup process (probably docker) for people to deploy ergo backend explorers


[11/09/2020 3:39 PM] Robert K#0722
So we can have dApps be less reliant on just the public explorer instance, and have the ecosystem be a bit more robust

He said he'd also be willing to do a smaller job without Grafana/ELK support if we wanted to scope the project down.

And are we intending to send Marek 50% prior to starting, and 50% after delivery?


[11/16/2020 11:00 AM] kushti#0978
Sounds good, we need to get his address also


[11/16/2020 11:00 AM] kushti#0978
Btw, we can try experiment with new spending scripts for treasury funds


[11/16/2020 11:02 AM] kushti#0978
And eventually, change spending condition for the Treasury (currently it is 2-out-of-3 multisig, the ring is about me, @morphic and catena, but it is  updateable)


[11/16/2020 11:04 AM] Robert K#0722
Great, I'll message Marek to get his address.


[11/16/2020 11:04 AM] Robert K#0722
Do we want to see if he's up for making this somewhat more marketable?


[11/16/2020 11:05 AM] Robert K#0722
Potentially we could make a public announcement that the EF is pushing forward with a new initiative for sponsoring key tooling to be built in the ecosystem and is starting this initiative off with a grant to Marek from stakenuts.


[11/16/2020 11:30 AM] Robert K#0722
Here is Marek's address: `9hV1TdXD31AZ8wndMDoHR6g277q6AiLB9vsEG1advkyxn4HY94o`


[11/16/2020 11:38 AM] Robert K#0722
And so for the above article/announcement idea, I messaged Marek and he said he'd want to be referenced as `Marek of FiveBianries` (https://www.fivebinaries.com/) which is a small company he and a couple other guys are running (which envelopes StakeNuts).


[11/16/2020 11:38 AM] Robert K#0722
So should I ping Casius to write an article about this grant?


[11/16/2020 1:09 PM] kushti#0978
A short article would be great!


[11/16/2020 1:09 PM] kushti#0978
On key tooling, very important


[11/16/2020 1:10 PM] kushti#0978
I'm still trying to get one guy to implement nipopows validation and node bootstrapping w. nipopows (


[11/16/2020 1:14 PM] Robert K#0722
Great, will get the article setup.


[11/16/2020 1:15 PM] Robert K#0722
Here's what Marek was thinking for the tool/project he's building:
```
so, my idea is that you would have a small shell script, where you would choose what you want to bootstap (node, explorer, frontend, grafan metrics, yoroi endpoints)
```


[11/16/2020 1:15 PM] Robert K#0722
So this might be the go-to setup tool for setting up any infrastructure-related tooling for Ergo.


[11/16/2020 1:16 PM] Robert K#0722
We have a yoroi-backend which we use for Yoroi that provides more user-friendly endpoints for wallets, and he wants to add support for that too.


[11/16/2020 1:16 PM] Robert K#0722
So then it'll also theoretically be more trivial for other light wallets to be built using their own deployment of node + explorer + yoroi backend  and get setup with this tool easily.


[11/16/2020 1:17 PM] Robert K#0722
> I'm still trying to get one guy to implement nipopows validation and node bootstrapping w. nipopows (

[11/19/2020 8:27 AM] Robert K#0722
We've seen that the free airdrop a few months ago didn't do much than attract "where me get airdrop" people, and then the "airdrop" on gate.io just tanked the price due to sell pressure


[11/19/2020 8:27 AM] Robert K#0722
And it's not like anyone who benefits from said airdrops actually cares about Ergo, they just sell and we effectively get no upside.


[11/20/2020 11:08 PM] kushti#0978
Digging through mailbox, there're some proposals
"
Market need:As the crypto markets grows and defi there is need to of safety and security that funds can stay in the market without much volatility. Especially big institutions and high net worth individuals and lastly for common retail investors.Many projects goes down in price and so is investors interest.What we can do is reduce volatility.Proposal: Just like S&P 500 and Nasdaq we can host index that tracks price of top 50 or 100 crypto projects. We will have significant advantage by going first and establishing trust in crypto community. Also, with time maybe we will be able to decouple the market from bitcoin dominance in the future. For example, bitcoin will make maybe less than 5% of this index so that even there is massive sell of in bitcoin other projects are holding strong. This will also provide alternative to stable coins as selling to stable coin is taxable event but buying index maybe not as will be more lucrative for many.I do not have coding background but will fund the right developers paid as the project finishes not all at once. What I require at the moment is $28 000 Usd or Ergo in worth same amount. 
Also, this is just the baby step towards more defi that can be done. If the proposal is accepted and index is done . I have more ideas if Ergo community wants to go forwards
Thank you."


[11/20/2020 11:08 PM] kushti#0978
I guess no need to vote on that  even ? )


[11/21/2020 9:36 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah seems no need to vote due to large amt they want and the fact not even a developer. But the idea of an ETF token on Ergo sounds interesting where one token represents a collection of underlying cryptos in a given % that changes with price as well as does price of the token. Guess could all be done via Oracles and be another synthetic with staking. But something like this probably down the road after stable coin working well as I think be more challenging and also smaller initial user base then a stable coin.


[11/21/2020 9:54 AM] Robert K#0722

I'll be just as motivated with 100 or 1,000 ERG, but 900 ERG for Eva and Chinese community I think can go a long way. More efficient use of resources.

#1 above is the English list of things Jinse will do. Eva will be good at chasing up Jinse and getting most out of them. Attached is minimum they are required to do for us which is also in contract although I think we will get more.


[01/23/2021 3:29 AM] Justin1000#9555
#2 is contract in Chinese. Its mostly list of what they can do with various legal mumbo jumbo. Shouldn't be too controversial as we are just giving them Ergs for their help on media. @kushti are you okay to sign Chinese contract? I can summarize the important parts in english or even do a partial translation...


[01/23/2021 3:29 AM] Justin1000#9555
The delay in getting us the contract is because I asked for an English version which takes them a long time for some reason! So last night i told them just to send Chinese.

found email from Jason Davies from January where he says this:"I would like to ask Ergo Foundation for a total of 100k ERG both as compensation for the bugs that I have found so far, and to fund my research into any current protocol or dApp bugs up until the end of June 2021.  So this would be approximately 50k ERG per year (or 1k ERG per week) as funding for past and ongoing security vulnerability research."


[02/13/2021 11:50 AM] mx#5165
today he sent new email


[02/13/2021 11:50 AM] mx#5165
"Dear Ergo Foundation,

I've found another high severity vulnerability, this time at the protocol level, impacting consensus.

In the absence of any clear guidance on vulnerability funding (see previous email) I'm reluctant to provide further details until this has been agreed.

I can give the following details:

- difficulty of exploitation: very high.
- scope: specific smart contracts only.
- impact: loss of funds.

It can be fixed at the smart contract level, but this would mean every smart contract within scope would need to include an additional check, so arguably it's a flaw in the protocol design, but it's up to the core developers to decide the best way forward.

I'm sorry I can't give any more clues without hinting at what the vulnerability entails!

Thank you,"

Man, Jason has turned out to be a be crummy guy all things considered


[02/13/2021 1:23 PM] Robert K#0722
Takes funds and does whatever the heck he wants and lies about delivery dates.


[02/13/2021 1:24 PM] Robert K#0722
Expects compensation for looking into stuff he wants, and then is effectively attempting to squeeze us for funds because he may have found some exploit even when he has failed to deliver anything previously that he has promised.


[02/13/2021 1:25 PM] Robert K#0722
I would probably respond with something approximating, "We don't trust you will deliver anything after your previous performance, so sadly we cannot give you any Ergs up front,".


[02/13/2021 1:26 PM] Robert K#0722
Plus we shouldn't be compensating someone who is grifting this much, especially when he's asking literally for $220k USD. Just stupid. (Plus we don't know if he'll just dump them all and crash the price immediately)


[02/13/2021 1:27 PM] Robert K#0722

[02/13/2021 3:42 PM] mx#5165
"Dear Ergo Foundation,

It seems vulnerabilities are found in clusters!

Another high severity vulnerability, this time of a different flavour: denial-of-service (blockchain forks, orphans, collapse in effective hashrate and ultimately secure functioning of the chain).

- difficulty of exploitation: high.
- scope: protocol.
- impact: denial-of-service/hashrate collapse.

Thank you,"

Also, every month Eva's salary (paid in ERG) will be fixed at the Gate ERG/USDT market rate as at the 1st of each month at 12:00 noon Beijing/Hong Kong time. I'll send the screen shot of the rate and her address after such time.

I'm not sure what this means. Can someone give a rough number of how many ERG are available to spend already now? Around 100-150K, or 2.1 million?


[02/26/2021 8:13 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
...or 2.1 million?


[02/26/2021 8:27 AM] Justin1000#9555
2.1mm is good...more than I thought. Regardless, I don't think we can be overly stingey in this critical time. Its imperative we take advantage of this bull market and positive momentum to get the ecosystem fully bootstrapped. Hopefully the Foundation ends up with something like ~1mm Ergs and a ~$100 ERG price so enough to last for like 10 years. But main priority now in my opinion is limiting the downside risk and getting ecosystem as built out as possible while things are much better than they have been since launch. The exchange footprint being a key priority - relatively low hanging fruit for the Foundation as we just agree and pay although they are expensive.


[02/26/2021 9:17 AM] Robert K#0722
Indeed I think the hardware wallet support is the first part of that

@kushti @morphic  Salary for Eva this month (Gate ERG/USDT rate as at the 1st of each month at 12:00 noon Beijing/Hong Kong time) should be US$1,500 / 3.3883 = ERG 442.70 sent to her address (same as last time):

[03/01/2021 9:02 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
From the 1,000 ERG being sent to me each month,  the last 2 months each I sent her ERG500 for her as bonus + ERG400 to be used for community airdrops etc. like I said I would do here: https://www.ergoforum.org/t/china-community-eva-salary-increase/534/8?u=mobybit
But I think that would be excessive now so instead I will send her a mere US$500 / 3.3883 = ERG148 so that her total compensation for the month is US$2,000 as she had previously asked for.


[03/01/2021 2:27 PM] kushti#0978

@deleted-role there's one bug buyer which name I can share in PM only who's willing to buy 250K ERG with 10% discount to the market price. I am going to share the name (Robert already knows it) and let's discuss here.


[03/03/2021 12:39 AM] Justin1000#9555
10% seems high. Quite different but for a sale of stock of less than 1% of the outstanding shares, 10% discount would basically be unheard of. So arguably we are giving something of significant value to this buyer if do it. At $3.60, could argue the max value being given is US$90k (10% * 3.6 *250k).
But should probably do it anyway as we need the USDT What we possibly get from it:
1) Liquidity at all once when we need the funds and we don't negatively impact the price - 250k Ergs would definitely hit the price. But we are also providing a lot of liquidity to the buyer so doesn't seem to me best justification
2) Save a lot of time of @kushti selling small bits to raise USDT
3) Get a new [good name] stake holder in - not sure who they are so can't judge this really
4) New stakeholder does stuff to benefit the platform such as exchanges, marketing, other - don't know who they are so I can't say on this but good to get to them to commit to doing some stuff up front

Do we really have 2.1mm Ergs locked and unlocked to be available to the foundation like the address above shows? 

If we really got 2.1mm ERGs and the buyer is good, I think would probably be good to do. As I mentioned somewhere else, I am more worried about protecting against downside risks then anything else and having a lot of USDT on hand is a way to do that. The price a month ago was <$1. Also, seems @kushti has not had the easiest time of raising funds through on-market sales.


[03/03/2021 2:55 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I think we should do it. 10% discount is huuuuuge, but we create "good will" with the buyer by giving him a happy price. And obviously better that we would do it now instead of when ERG price was at less than $1.


[03/03/2021 4:33 AM] Justin1000#9555
Oh I see the buyer. Yeah should do it for sure.


[03/03/2021 8:46 AM] kushti#0978
The buyer is promising to jump on Ergo heavily after buying, so we're attracting smart money kind of.

[03/03/2021 8:49 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yes. This 250k sale at 10 pct discount has my 100% support. I will keep completely confidential but buyer can announce when/if they see fit. Would be added positive.


[03/03/2021 8:54 AM] Robert K#0722
I am for this as well, the funds are needed and this will be a net benefit.


[03/03/2021 9:55 AM] morphic#4133
Hm, the price goes up if demand is higher than supply. If we sell huge chunks of ERGs below the market we are not only reducing the demand and price increase, but we also give people unfair advantage in selling earlier at lower prices.
I don't see any reason why anyone with long-term focus cannot start accumulating on the market. We have $1,420,350 24H volume now, which is twice as more than what is necessary for this buyer. 
And we are interested in the price to go up.

I propose  to make the following deal. 
He buys 125K ERGs on the market, show us his wallet balance and we sell 125K with 10% discount OTC. This will both the push price up a bit, and we also compensate him for price increase.


[03/03/2021 10:24 AM] morphic#4133
I also can help @kushti with accumulating USDT on the exchanges. I can create a separate special purpose accounts on gate, hotbit and coinex and trade there a couple of days per week (e.g. the days kushti wants to free from this)


[03/03/2021 11:03 AM] Justin1000#9555
Its normal in negotiated private financing for companies to reach terms with investors that are based largely on other things the investor can offer besides just financing. This is a strategic investor of the highest order and I think the terms are fine especially when take into account the big financing need we have now, the time constraints we have and fact this investor is willing to buy a large chunk after a large price rise - very bullish sign to whole market. So I have no reservations at all on this and personally do not think it is a good idea to ask the investor to do anything like buy on market or show a wallet balance. Its a bilateral negotiated deal and fair in my view.

[03/03/2021 11:04 AM] Justin1000#9555
Most of that volume is fake, MM wash trading etc. To buy 125k or even 250k is doable but time consuming and slow on multiple exchanges. Way harder than that usd 1.5mm figure suggests. I do not think given what this investor can offer we should insist on that.


[03/03/2021 11:26 AM] kushti#0978
Investor is also willing to have privacy, and his guys are lazy to buy on exchanges


[03/03/2021 11:30 AM] Justin1000#9555
For some more context on why I personally so okay with this proposed sale at a discount is I worked many years at top investment banks for private financings called ‚ÄúSpecial Situations‚Äù, usually highly structured transformative financings for high growth stage of a company with limited financing options who wants money but also wants to attract best investor possible. This has a lot of similarities‚Ä¶kinda like Bain private equity or something doing a ton of work on your company then coming in early with a good size financing. On those type of deals, the actual terms (in this case discount %) are really secondary to quality of investor. We know this investors quality, synergies with Ergo and fact they have done the work and know Ergo well. And we know they can offer a ton of ‚Äústrategic‚Äù help for Ergo.


[03/03/2021 11:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
If another random investor, then I would have some reservations ‚Äì the only selling point would be the big size of the financing after a substantial run-up. At least would be interested to explore if could simply raise the funds on market as you suggest. But I don‚Äôt have any such reservation given the quality of this investor. Another thing is the 10% is actually not that big‚Ä¶have to keep in mind how crazy volatile crypto prices are.


[03/03/2021 11:32 AM] Justin1000#9555
On those special sits deals, the good investors get preferential treatment and better terms than the investors with little to offer. For example, a top tier long-term private equity investor might get much better terms than a hedge fund just looking to flip. So in short...a discount in my view is entirely acceptable and within market norms of even traditional financing, not even to mention the crazy crypto world.

[03/03/2021 11:35 AM] Justin1000#9555
yes. need to **Protect the Downside**. This to me is the Foundations #1 priority right now. and price can move so much so quick in either direction, its just a far secondary concern getting the best pricing. This investor is offering both size and also is just about the highest quality investor we could hope to get in.

Ok, guys, I don't know this investor (not even a clue), but also fully rely on your opinion. Indeed, long-term, high level investor with partnership potential is more important then 10% discount. 
So, I don't have objections against this deal.


[03/03/2021 1:00 PM] kushti#0978
@morphic you can find name in your PM


[03/03/2021 4:06 PM] morphic#4133
yes, but this name doesn't tell me anything, I missed something for sure.


[03/03/2021 9:09 PM] mx#5165
10% discount can be reward for marketing i guess in this case


[03/03/2021 9:18 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
The Investor will be great to have as a strategic investor. Even at 10% discount, in a way I, think we are getting a good deal since it is not back when ERG was less than $1.


[03/03/2021 11:02 PM] kushti#0978

Hedge some part into USDT/C ?


[03/03/2021 11:03 PM] kushti#0978
I am not proficient in portfolio management and predicting markets at all.


[03/03/2021 11:04 PM] kushti#0978
Also, let's think how to spend the money.


[03/03/2021 11:05 PM] kushti#0978
E.g. have 250K reserve for development through a possible cryptowinter, $250K to buyback if ERG is falling below $1 , $250K on listings and marketing ?


[03/03/2021 11:36 PM] Justin1000#9555
Not our job in the Foundation to speculate on the markets. So lets not base decisions based on where we think market is going.


[03/03/2021 11:41 PM] Justin1000#9555
*BTC/USDT: Suggest selling 80% for USDT . Some small amount maybe good for some vendors who want BTC. I suppose an argument could be made for keeping some because the price could blow out a lot more this year. In any case, we shouldn‚Äôt speculate on BTC price. I think it is likely going to ~$200k this year but still doesn‚Äôt change my recommendation for Foundation which is sell so the 80% of BTC for USDT. Only reason don't suggest higher than 80% is there might some correlation between expenses in the industry and BTC price so keeping 20% is kinda like a hedge for that.


[03/03/2021 11:44 PM] Justin1000#9555
(1)    US$250k Reserve for Crypto Winter: I think this is good idea. Can build it further as we have more funds, can consider taking to US$300k if @kushti is more comfortable.
(2)    US$[250]k Held back to Take Advantage of a Dip in Erg Price down to $1 to by more: Don‚Äôt think we need this and can be ZERO. This is more like trading and fund management and do not think we should engage in this because 1) We need to deploy the max funds ASAP to take advantage of market and build out the exchange foot print; 2) our job is to spend Ergs not buy them (and I understand we still got 2 million); 3) Dip to below $1 not likely; 4) We already got the reserve fund above for bad market/low ERG price.
(3)    US$[500]k: Mainly listings. 1) Kucoin; 2) Contact Huobi/Binance/OKEx/Kraken/Bitfinx further after Kucoin announcement. Boost this to $500k by moving all of (2) here. Once on Kucoin we can probably get on one of the other bigger ones mentioned above (Huobi?). Will be expensive but they might give us a deal and hopefully will be within our budget. A small amount could be considered for a developer or marketer. But I note that our China marketing seems fine and community led intnl marketing seems to be picking up without dedicating some huge budget so exchanges are priority I think.


[03/03/2021 11:46 PM] Justin1000#9555
IMPORTANT NOTE: If the investor announces the investment and becomes more active in the community, would be huge plus and likely boost price significantly making (2) even less relevant and insuring we have funds to fully execute on the exchange listings, not to mention the exchanges would view the news positively.


[03/04/2021 8:47 AM] Robert K#0722
I agree with @Justin1000, though I would make the $500k (3) into listings/potential impactful grants. Things like the ledger integration for example are very important as well, and if we want to hire good devs externally typically they'll take usdt/c or btc. So keeping that chunk of the funds open for such things that can make a large direct impact I believe makes sense.


[03/04/2021 9:01 AM] kushti#0978
Alright, so then let's have $300 reserve for a cryptowinter + $450K for fulfilling the roadmap and listings


[03/04/2021 3:26 PM] kushti#0978
The fixed price is $3.20 ((


[03/04/2021 3:26 PM] kushti#0978
so 2.88 with 10% discount


[03/04/2021 3:36 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah frustrating price just took a dip but is what it is. Still quite a lot higher than just 30 days ago...


[03/04/2021 4:20 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 so it seems the deal can be much worse even, we got into some problems


[03/05/2021 10:07 PM] kushti#0978

[03/05/2021 10:09 PM] kushti#0978
So they're interested in grabbing some tokens and also investing in some projects on Ergo


[03/05/2021 10:09 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 you had SPV idea around mainnet launch, maybe doable now ?


[03/08/2021 4:22 AM] Justin1000#9555
I don't know. Are we? Is the deal at US$2.88 still going through as agreed? Or do they want to renogiate the price because of the drop? If normal market volatility then, I would not be too agreeable to renegotiating the agreed price...everyone knows crypto prices are volatile and I don't think we would have renogated had the price risen 20% right after agreement.


[03/08/2021 4:25 AM] Justin1000#9555
But in this case guess the stable coin imploded right after price agreement so not unimaginable they would want to renegotiate. anyway what is going on there? Is the deal done or we need to renogiate? Think we should get it finalized for good asap if not already done.


[03/08/2021 4:26 AM] Justin1000#9555
That was a mining SPV that I was exploring at launch. Seems especially interesting because of non-outsourceability. But I certainly won't be doing anything on that. Not a miner...too technical...tons of work...probably not even that attractive now that we have super competitive pools.


[03/08/2021 4:38 AM] Justin1000#9555
C Fund: Sounds like good news. I think they make sense as an investor and funding projects on top of Ergo should make a lot of sense for them as it is still super early and Ergo DAPPS have already proven to make profit. I see their announced investment target size per investment at launch of fund was $250-500k. If they aren't planning to buy in market and want to buy direct from Foundation then need to discuss how many willing to sell especially as selling so much to other investor already at these prices.


[03/08/2021 9:07 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 so as price fallen significantly, I think we need to make into agreement again on whether we are selling or not to the unnamed buyer.


[03/08/2021 9:08 AM] kushti#0978
On CFund, no need to sell from the Treasury I guess, but where they can grab some tokens then ?


[03/08/2021 10:41 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think we should offer the unnamed buyer 300k ERGs at $2.50 (so basically no discount). That would raise enough funds (the original target), the Foundation can afford it if it has 2mm and can be argued the negative news about stable coin is priced in so don't need a discount. Anyway the price is way lower in terms of dollars, sats and ADA. Noone ever knows what right valuation is in this space so the 10% discount is quite arbitrary.


[03/08/2021 10:42 AM] Justin1000#9555
But if don't have firm solution yet for the Oracle Pool problem, maybe that would be an issue for the unnamed buyer.


[03/08/2021 11:14 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
The price was already fixed at 2.88


[03/08/2021 11:15 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Should keep the agreed price.


[03/08/2021 2:12 PM] Justin1000#9555
Could probably buy on exchanges over like 5 days without pushing price up much. But quite troublesome of course and probably have same concerns as the unnamed buyer. Not sure on latest with OTC but suspect isn't so easy to find coins there because the big miners should be gone and most people who got a big stake of Ergs now probably have strong hands. Could be 100k available there though. I am not even in any of the chats...there was one set up here on discord long time ago by I think "Obiwan".


[03/08/2021 2:15 PM] Justin1000#9555
crypt0biwan set it up the OTC channel i remember before...

[03/10/2021 8:47 AM] morphic#4133
I agree with @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ we need to stick with the agreed price (if there was an agreement). This shouldn't be a big deal for the unnamed investor if he/she is indeed a long-term. The price drop was equally unexpected for everyone, so if the investor wants to take an advantage out of it, then the market is a good vehicle for that.


[03/10/2021 9:13 AM] kushti#0978
So we're selling at 2.88 ?


[03/10/2021 9:25 AM] morphic#4133
Yes, if the price has been agreed upon. We will secure our funds then as was planned.


[03/10/2021 12:20 PM] kushti#0978
I guess that means that the deal is cancelled.


[03/10/2021 12:49 PM] kushti#0978
"Yes, we are ready to buy 250K ERGO from the Foundation at 10% discount on the market price"


[03/10/2021 1:01 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Any idea if they would still be ready to buy 250K ERGO from the Foundation at 10% discount on the market price a month from now?


[03/10/2021 1:07 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Really painful if we lose the 2.88 price. But seems this Investor could add a lot of value. Maybe we can negotiate for 2.50 (which is about in the middle of the 2.88 price and  10% discount on the current market price) or even at the market price.


[03/11/2021 8:01 AM] kushti#0978
Above market price is not realistic


[03/11/2021 8:01 AM] kushti#0978

Probably better to sell 250K ERG at 10% discount to the strategic Investor than to a non-strategic investor.


[03/11/2021 8:20 AM] kushti#0978
The same buyer, different seller


[03/11/2021 11:41 AM] Justin1000#9555
Sell 150k ERG at 10 pct discount to current price is ok with me. Probably going to look like a cheap price in a few months but better that than run out of money


[03/11/2021 11:41 AM] Justin1000#9555
And can get the strategic onboard


[03/11/2021 11:42 AM] Justin1000#9555

Tbh I think selling 250k Ergs at the current price is fine as well. Funds are needed to do anything and being nit-picky when the ecosystems *needs* to keep growing, potentially needing to hire another dev or two to help build things faster, and doing potential exchange listings seems unwise, especially when the buyer will likely push the coin once he has sufficient bags.

[04/16/2021 4:59 AM] Justin1000#9555
From me in early March Ôºö‚Äú*BTC/USDT: Suggest selling 80% for USDT . Some small amount maybe good for some vendors who want BTC. I suppose an argument could be made for keeping some because the price could blow out a lot more this year. In any case, we shouldn‚Äôt speculate on BTC price.

[04/16/2021 5:00 AM] Justin1000#9555
This still seems about right to me but probably should keep more in BTC so maybe only recommend selling 70 percent for USDT or a little more if you like.


[04/16/2021 5:02 AM] Justin1000#9555
General guideline for use of BTCÔºèUSDT funds should be 30 pct held in reserve for ‚Äúcrypto winter‚Äú and 70 pct to be spent on things we need centralized party for. Mainly this will be exchanges but also high impact grants like the ledger integration.


[04/16/2021 5:04 AM] Justin1000#9555
I don't think we should right this minute. We got way more than ever had before and the upside catalysts for ERG price are great in near term. Let's monitor closely but probably have in mind not selling more ERGs for USDTÔºèBTC until ÔΩûÔºÑ10 area. Although we also need to take into account unexpected expenses that may arrive so this is a moving target.


[04/16/2021 6:51 AM] Justin1000#9555
The Foundation could also consider holding like half the crypto winter reserve in SigUSD to free up more of the BTC/USDT reserves for spending. But can decide later. Guess would have to be cautious on that...


[04/19/2021 12:21 PM] kushti#0978

[04/19/2021 12:55 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yes I think it is best policy. Can keep ~30 pct in BTC but safest to convert rest to USDT.

@deleted-role cFund is willing to buy 100K ERG now and do partnership as well. Your thoughts ?


[04/19/2021 2:20 PM] Justin1000#9555
Sounds great! I note that:
*Fund is joint project of IOHK and Wave Financial to invest in projects that are part of the Cardano eco-system
*We already know IOHK well‚Ä¶obviously great to have them invested into Ergo‚Ä¶and I note that Charles is advisor to CFund
*Wave Financial looks pretty good. >$500mm under management, US-based and team has very strong background in traditional finance. Look like a mature group and probably well connected in the US
*This type of sale to a long-term strategic investor is MUCH MUCH better than selling some ERGs on Gate to people we have no idea who they are
*Looks like still got 1.8mm in the treasury so this will only be a small part of that


[04/19/2021 2:22 PM] Justin1000#9555
Hopefully this can accomplish the following:
*Get new professional investor in who will fight for and promote Ergo
*Confirm Ergo as part of the Cardano ecosystem attracting more ADA people in and also more marketing help as part of that ecosystem
*Raise funds which we still need despite the sale of 250k Ergs to the other investor


[04/19/2021 2:23 PM] Justin1000#9555
So I think should do it. But good to ask ahead of time what they imagine doing for Ergo as part of the partnership. Before saying yes to their investment, good to hear from them how they plan to help.

I'm ok to reduce back down to 5000 starting from May. And expect this to be disconnected (as it has always been) from the price for some time, say until end of foundation getting ERG from miners (which is middle of 2021 I guess). 
I have not been selling since mid 2019 essentially spending my savings, so I would like to enjoy some compensation getting the same 5000 when prices are hopefully high, at least for some time.
Also I expect to receive ERGs for Jan, Feb, Mar and Apr as previously agreed (i.e. 4 * 7K = 21K), which I didn't received yet.


[04/21/2021 3:16 PM] Justin1000#9555
I agree with morphic on timing of reduction. In my opinion should not be in a rush to reduce it immediately after a price rise although it does make sense to reduce it like ~2 months after reaching a higher price level. People working for Erg salary should be able to enjoy a little time of excess pay in event price goes up rapidly i think.


[04/21/2021 3:19 PM] morphic#4133
I also don't agree with kushti setting his comp to 0. It is obviously his choice though.

Yes...not good. Now that have funds, probably the solution is getting legal entity and possibly getting accountant and maybe even custodian. I don't know how its done in other Foundations but there are tons of precedents so we should look to gather information right now so we can get it all put into place as soon as possible...but will likely take a little time still.

@deleted-role Please vote on this proposal to make Tango Ergo Ambassador. Please read the detailed proposal by Eva first before considering.


[05/14/2021 5:55 AM] Justin1000#9555
4 votes in favor of Tango as Ambassador so going to consider that a done deal if no objections. We will need to announce him on our website as Ambassador to give him legitimacy. I think it will be good to have an aggressive connected China crypto businessman running around China talking about Ergo but I can't predict exact results.

@kushti Not sure if we have been actively raising USDT lately? At above $8 it would probably make sense to sell ~7.5k ERGs a day for say 10 days for each day it is above $8. I expect the price to keep rising. But it seems prudent to raise some USDT here as never know for sure. Essential to protect downside risk. Also we will probably need a lot of USDT in coming months for big exchange listings.


[05/14/2021 12:44 PM] Justin1000#9555
Price is all over the place. $8 is arbitrary but I feel it is about right. So I suggest selling like 7.5k ERG every day price is above that for a max of 10 days. I don't think we are desperate for USDT right now so maybe no need if below that level.


[05/14/2021 1:18 PM] Justin1000#9555
Maybe 5k ERGs per day. Lets not get in the way of further price risesüôÇ


[05/14/2021 2:37 PM] morphic#4133
yeah, that is what I wanted to propose as well. Setup a grid or sell orders in a range $8-10, small enough to not influence the market. And DCA for some time until we accumulate enough USDT for upcoming listings and also to have half an year reserve for monthly USDT expenses.


[05/14/2021 4:05 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah doesn't have to be 5k a day over 10 days. My point is @kushti is do it over enough time not to smash the price and sentiment. That could be a few days or 20 days but above 8 dollars sounds about right. I guess you know all that already though.


[05/14/2021 8:46 PM] kushti#0978
Agreed, anyone can do that ?


[05/14/2021 8:46 PM] kushti#0978
I am even more overbusy these days


[05/14/2021 8:47 PM] kushti#0978
paid $60K for Changelly / Bitcoin.com, will do a voting later


[05/14/2021 8:48 PM] kushti#0978
sorry for such a mess


[05/15/2021 10:49 PM] morphic#4133
After rounds of discussions with @kushti and because he thinks the amount of ERGs is unfair I decided to propose the following plan:
1) The compensation will be the same 5000 ERG until 1 July, i.e. until the end of the first period when EF gets 7.5 ERG from every block. (only June remains).
2) Starting from July 2021 it will be reduced down to 3000 for 3 months (i.e. when EF gets 4.5 from every block). The decrease is proportional i.e. 4.5 / 7.5 = 3000 / 5000
3) Starting from October 2021 it will be further reduced down to 1000 per month. (i.e. when EF gets 1.5 from every block) and I will work half time.
4) These upcoming 7 months is enough time to finish v5.0, clean up the codebase (remove the old implementation), fully document sigma code, finalize specification.
5) In parallel, EF hire someone who will replace me in further Sigma development (v6.x and above). I will transfer my work to him/her. I don't think some compiler hacker will just join us and do random contributions, EF need to hire professional compiler engineer to replace me.
6) Starting from Jan 2022 no compensation from EF and I will step down from core development.
I will still continue to passively support Sigma and Appkit on demand (by code review and consultations), but hope code contributions will not be required from me in 2022.
7) After stepping down, I plan to work independently on Ergo related projects. If
things go really well (like Erg above $100), chances are I will hire some devs for the projects (if not so well, then will not hire).

In total 17K = 5K + 3 * 3K + 3 * 1K for roughly 7 months, at the current $10 per ERG this is $170K, not totally astronomical amount. If the price drops I will not complain.

This plan is a compromise between my expectations and the reality.
Also I think it reflects both mine and EF long-term interests.
 
So, what do you guys think? Do you agree with the plan?

[05/16/2021 12:06 AM] kushti#0978
so USDT can be risky as well @Justin1000


[05/16/2021 12:07 AM] kushti#0978
@morphic what's current status with finding devs for Sigma? I guess it is being discussed for many months to the moment


[05/16/2021 12:09 AM] kushti#0978
@morphic also, I proposed to fix in USD mostly, as done for other engineers


[05/16/2021 6:07 AM] Justin1000#9555
My general thoughts on compensation below:
*At really low market cap and liquidity (like Ergo historically) I think compensation should be similar to a start-up‚Ä¶low salary but lots of upside optionality

*We are hopefully beyond this point for good now

*So now compensation would ideally be more oriented toward fixed US$ salary but with some added upside optionality ‚Äì this would normally be done with options for a start-up but we don‚Äôt have those of course

*Probably should have a ‚Äúsalary‚Äù number of ERGs linked to USD payable every month + a base amount of ERGs payable per month regardless of ERG:USD price (the upside optionality)

*As mentioned before I don‚Äôt think we need to be in a rush to lower ERG payouts to people because price just spiked. That arguably takes away the upside. So I certainly don‚Äôt oppose keeping the 5k ERG payment to @morphic for June.

*But yes going forward (guess starting July is good), we should probably move to a more USD-oriented ‚Äúsalary‚Äù like @kushti is suggesting


[05/16/2021 6:09 AM] Justin1000#9555
@morphic‚Äôs proposal isn‚Äôt unreasonable to me but I would propose an alternative more USD-linked plan for consideration. 
*5,000 ERGs for June
*1,000 ERGs per month from July to December (the ‚Äúupside optionality‚Äù)
*Such additional number of ERGs to equal USD [16,000] in value based on the ERG:USD exchange rate at each month for July to December at full-time rate
*So that would be total of 11,000 ERGs + US$[16.0]k per month ERG equivalent for July ‚Äì Sep when full-time, US$[8.0]k when part-time during Oct-Dec
*This way if the price goes up crazily, @mophic still gets a lot of upside for this period. But if goes down a lot he gets solid USD-equivalent compensation anyway
*I don‚Äôt think we have to be perfect right now. But moving to something close to above plan may set a better precedent and possibly more consistent with our new scale.


[05/16/2021 6:42 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti another thing that has really been bothering me lately is what i think a huge number of ERGs you paid of pocket for things because it wasn't practical to get Foundation sign-off first. Probably nothing can be done about the vast majority of these. But if there is some big single items that stand out you may want to at least raise them now for consideration. Specifically thinking of the bonus given to the miners at time of Hard Fork...not sure who paid that and if it was paid but if it came from you, maybe we should consider having Foundation pay you back now.

[05/16/2021 6:43 AM] Justin1000#9555
It was never voted on but I would note that at the time @Robert K proposed foundation funding it and that got 3 up votes in the Foundation chat. So that is 4 people that clearly supported Foundation paying for it.


[05/16/2021 6:44 AM] Justin1000#9555
Anyway, we would have to discuss such a big item and implications of Foundation paying for it so long after the date...but probably now is last chance to consider it.


[05/16/2021 7:20 AM] Justin1000#9555
There is a USDC:USDT pair at Gate.io that traded $1mm past 24 hours. We can consider putting USDT in that instead. Circle is backed by Goldman, regulated in US, audited by Grant thornton. Probably USDT is backed enough to maintain its value but the regulatory risk is real...


[05/16/2021 8:58 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 yes, I paid a lot out of my personal money, starting from the Asian RoadShow in 2019 etc. I am not worrying about that much though, and do not have time for accounting right now. Maybe I will just do some donations campaign after ErgoFund is live, or ask EF about some ERG (much less than I paid for sure) when having more time.


[05/16/2021 9:02 AM] Justin1000#9555
Okay. Maybe Foundation can at least give the ERG equivalent now to the USD equivalent you spent on the big items that are easy to calculate. Anyway, I encourage you to put up for a vote soon if you like. Yeah, I think a donation campaign makes a lot of sense. Maybe someone else in the community can start it. Probably community would be very supportive after great success recently. And it would have side benefit of good publicityüôÇ


[05/16/2021 9:24 AM] mx#5165
this is known from many years, it was updated even on the website long ago, and has nothing to do with existing "selloff", if this chart is real then it is better backed than fiat in standard bank


[05/16/2021 9:26 AM] mx#5165
different politics wanting to keep or change existing banking models is another story


[05/16/2021 10:43 AM] morphic#4133
yes, I raised this issue long ago, but:
1) it has never been decided clearly with some action plan, just exchange of opinions
2) I'm still not clear about whether you support it of not. I don't remember you responded like "cool, let's do it" etc. You advertise other positions in twitter but never mentioned this one. Also, last time I mentioned that we need sigma developers, you didn't liked it or otherwise supported.
3) We probably need to have somebody (like Armeanio) who will take care of HR and people management.

I think it is time to have dedicated people in all key directions. Again, I proposed this already long ago, that we need somebody with HR/headhunting experience. I don't remember any shout out in the community channels about this vacancy.

You are asking me about "status", which means you still think I will solve it somehow, I'm afraid it will never happen this way, especially when you ignoring this issue or is neutral to it. I previously already explained why and how I can be involved.

Seems to me you guys were basically working for free in 2020, especially when price was at $0.20, should be rewarded for that kind of dedication and heart and enjoy some upside now.


[05/16/2021 3:07 PM] Justin1000#9555
Seems we need some sort of full service provider if possible that will manage the treasury funds that are with the exchanges and taken out of the original ERGO treasury. And ideally do MM etc as well. Then that would free you up and increase security of assets in theory.


[05/16/2021 3:07 PM] Justin1000#9555
It will surely be expensive but that is a secondary concern now.


[05/16/2021 3:08 PM] Justin1000#9555
I just checked with an old friend who is now at the Tezos Foundation...he said such service providers are available and can make introductions. He should know but I will not vouch is reliability and I have not dealt with this before.


[05/16/2021 3:09 PM] Justin1000#9555
Perhaps I can explore with my contacts but we should also get Armeanio involved? He already had discussions with some top MMs. The main thing is we need to see if can urgently solve the problem and expense is a secondary concern now.


[05/17/2021 12:01 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 I guess we need to incorporate first ?


[05/17/2021 5:45 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think so. I am going to try and confirm discreetly though.


[05/17/2021 5:47 AM] Justin1000#9555
Hoping dentons responds asap on singapore. I am planning to pay harneys to assess ergo for cayman today. But sounds like cayman will take 1 month minimum to get set up if all goes smoothly. I would guess will take a bit longer though.


[05/17/2021 8:33 AM] morphic#4133
The plan from Justin is also ok for me.  If there is no objections, should I put it on the forum for voting?


[05/17/2021 12:49 PM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti Maybe you should also consider if anyone on the team should be given "bonuses" in June. It should all be reasonable of course but if it should be done probably June payouts is good timing. Not sure but it may be more cumbersome in near future to do such things. Also after big improvement lately might be good to award people for their efforts. But leave it to you! Just a thought I had

@kushti wonder roughly what our USDT balance on-hand is? additional exchange listings could cost a lot...


[05/21/2021 11:52 AM] Justin1000#9555
And another thing I think we should all keep in mind is the potential high attractiveness of additional sales of tokens to high quality institutional investors. I met 3 just yesterday. If these guys were to come in, could offer a lot of help to us probably. Maybe we shouldn't be selling on exchange but rather to high quality strategic investors at a 10-20% discount. See exchanges-bizdev chat for more details.


[05/21/2021 12:44 PM] Robert K#0722
I agree that we should treat the Ergs in the EF similarly to equity in a startup.


[05/21/2021 12:45 PM] Robert K#0722
It doesn't make sense to sell equity to random nobodies to just have some cash on hand, but best to sell to investors with connections who can provide you with opportunities and resources that you wouldn't have had access to prior, and they now have a direct benefit in doing so.


[05/21/2021 12:46 PM] Robert K#0722
The sticking point here is that we need to plan ahead a bit more and sell Ergs in advance so that there is lee-way between existing USDT holdings and how much is expected to be spent in the next X months (say 3-6)


[05/21/2021 12:47 PM] Robert K#0722
Which given the current price increases, makes this not a bad moment to start to pursue a strategy like this.


[05/23/2021 10:58 PM] kushti#0978
I guess it can be considered as approved with 4/5 votes , no need to listen to me specifically


[05/23/2021 10:59 PM] kushti#0978
@morphic please put your proposal on voting this month if you're going for that


[05/23/2021 11:01 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 
Bad news: 
I sold only 1 BTC @ ~$56K, other BTCs not touched

Good news:
For all the exchanges and Ledger, enough USDT (so $120K+$150K+$7K - $56K (1 BTC) ) were raised by just selling ERG @ $12-16


[05/24/2021 4:46 AM] Justin1000#9555
That isn‚Äôt enough! The liquidity was such that easily could have sold 50-75k Ergs in that period at prices averaging well over $10. Again probably price is going much higher but we need to be prudent and more aggressive in raising USDT. Should have sold BTC too as that is super easy to sell and liquid. These big exchanges could cost like $500k each I guess.
I recommend:
*Putting in total sell orders for 20k ERG in order size of ERG <1,000 ERG each from current price up to $1 above current price in roughly equal increments
*Putting in sell orders for 50k ERG in order size of ERG <1,000 ERG each for prices $10 to $15 in roughly equal increments
*If price drops to $6.25 or lower, look to close the deal with CFund immediately given we need the funds
*This way 1) you spend minimal amounts of your own time (just need to put in the sell orders); 2) if price pops back up to $10-15, we raise plenty of funds; 3) if price drops to $6.25 or lower we raise plenty of funds from CFunds and bring in a quality new investor
*Just hold the BTC I think. I can‚Äôt advocate selling it at such a big loss now!


[05/24/2021 4:47 AM] Justin1000#9555
Its hard to justify a 20% discount for CFunds if the price is on the way down but we need the funds so should look to close deal ASAP if price drops to $6.25 or lower. Seems Armeanio is already getting them lined up fortunately.


[05/24/2021 9:44 AM] Justin1000#9555
Probably don't need to be precise about orders. 10-15 chunky orders for total of 50-70k ERGs between current price and $15 should be okay. But seems to me we should ensure we have adequate funds in case we enter crypto winter (seems unlikely). Also, we need quite a lot of funds I think for 3rd parties like exchanges, market-makers and many others.


[05/24/2021 5:15 PM] morphic#4133
I gave it another round of thought lately. Regardless of the financial part, the working plan will remain the same as I wrote before.

For financial part, I don't really feel comfortable to receive tokens as compensation for my work since it recently have become forbidden by Russian law.

With the above in mind, ideally, the plan would be:
1) I get 5000 ERG for June and it will be the last transfer
2) I will no longer get any tokens starting from July. 
3) The USDT+ERG payments (as suggested in the plan from Justin) will be postponed until the legal entity is incorporated.
After that, they will be payed in full by bank transfer (in equivalent USD mount on CMC).

Let me know if this is ok? I will create a post for voting.


[05/26/2021 10:41 AM] kushti#0978
@morphic I suppose your engineer salary should be fixed in USD, and possible options package to be discussed with an assigned legal entity executives after. Options should be connected with deliverables and/or long-term (3-5 years) commitments as usually.


[05/26/2021 11:20 AM] morphic#4133

I don't want to spend everybody's time to argue about "the plan". You can follow my plan, or Justin's plan, or not to follow any plan at all. 
I already expressed my expectations and concerns, so I leave the final decision to the board.

FYI: I gave Tango, our China Ambassador 300 ERGs ~2 weeks ago. I think this is in recognition of his past help more than anything. The original proposal approved here was 200 ERGs a month to him for 6 months but I now think we can go without that and just give him these 300 so will be less expensive than originally planned. So far no offline events that needed to reimburse him for. Will push him to do something later...maybe after we get added to more pools/exchanges and got our momentum back.

Dentons says the actual fees may be much lower than the 40k and we can pay in 10k installments if we want and first thing we can cover is those issues I mention to minimize cost in case we change our mind after delving into those. I have dealt with many law firms in past on similar engagements with up front deposit payable and am not worried myself about them overcharging us or not refunding our balance of the deposit though so see no problem with just paying them the 40k.

2. Send 150 Ergs to Galsgow for him to use at his discretion for tip bot and community.


[07/01/2021 8:47 AM] Justin1000#9555
Well you already gave a ton of your own Ergs to Up. What does he need more for?


[07/01/2021 8:49 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think 150 ERGs to Glasgow is fine as long as he thinks he can use them. Probably you should tell him to make them last a month though if he can...like don't give them all away in one day...probably he wouldn't do that anyway...


[07/01/2021 9:05 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Up does not need any more Ergs. In May I (personally) had agreed to send Up a total  of 5,000 Ergs (as per proposal in Word doc Eva posted in Ergonauts in May) spread out from May - Aug. I've already sent him 3,000 Ergs and "owe" him another 1,000 now and the final 1,000 Ergs on 1 Aug. This 300 Ergs from the Special Ops fund would go to me just to partially offset the 1,000 Ergs I am sending him now, not an additional 300 to go to Up.

As for Glasgow, the 150 Ergs would be for full month of July and anything not distributed would roll forward to August.


[07/01/2021 9:27 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
This 300 Ergs would be the first Ergs from EF to go to Up (in case I wasn't clear on that).


[07/01/2021 10:15 AM] morphic#4133
You mean 300 ERGs now as the first EF spending to Up and then the remaining 4700 Ergs out of 5000 total are due to be spent by EF later?


[07/02/2021 3:54 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
No, I will not be asking EF for the remaining 4,700 Ergs in the future. Only asking EF for 300 Ergs now and likely I will ask for another 300 next month for Up, would be total 600 Ergs from EF to Up. The remaining 4,700 (or 4,400 if I ask EF for another 300 Ergs next month) will come out of my own funds. I am not planning on asking for reimbursement. Such large amounts I think should be put to formal vote, which I did not want to do since seems kind of a gamble on Up and I did not want to make a proposal to EF with weak speculative reasoning so easier just to speculate on Up with my own funds instead.


[07/02/2021 3:57 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Up is doing a lot (it seems) in Wechat and QQ and the idea was to front load his rewards in good faith and hope that he will continue to be long term active in building China community.


[07/02/2021 3:59 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
So the grand total from EF to Up would be 300 or 600 Ergs.


[07/02/2021 4:01 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
As for Glasgow, since Kushti announced the Special Ops budget in Ergonauts, I'll let Glasgow draw on it directly, no need for it to go through me. So I wont send Glasgow any Ergs.


[07/02/2021 4:17 AM] Justin1000#9555
I am in favor of a partial reimbursement to you. I have not dug too deeply but I saw that Up was very active and brought in hundreds of people on Wechat and probably did a lot of stuff I am unaware of. On the other hand, I have doubts he was worth the very large number of Ergs you gave him and I don't think the Foundation would have ever signed off on it. But anyway, I support a partial reimbursment so if that is 300 per month from the special operations budget or if you want to put it to a vote and ask for a certain amount and cite all the stuff Up has done I guess it is fine by me at least.


[07/02/2021 7:49 AM] Justin1000#9555

Yeah probably Up did  do a lot and at minimum you should be reimbursed for 30%...maybe more would be deserved but not sure practical. I suppose if you want to ask you can outline all he did and propose it.

"At my regular job, I get around 30 EUR/35 US$ an hour. This as a comparison. A split USDT/ERG is a good thing in my opinion to participate in Ergo's success."
Based on this I propose to give him slighly more and 3 options to choose from (with different USDT and ERG per hour rates) as in the table

Found a simple way to sell ERG, using time condition on gate.io

It was really easy just to put ~1000 ERG sell orders at prices going up from 8 dollars to 20 dollars on gate when price was higher (as i suggested at time). Plenty of liquidity even if may not have looked like it from the order book. Anyway, hopefully price gets another boost soon with DEX, kucoin and better market environment.

So Morphic, me, Noah, Robert and Armeanio all voted in favor of the $50k ERG payment to get on F2 Pool on the Exchanges-Bizdev chat. Kushti voted no but I think we can consider it passed. Guess won‚Äôt get unanimity in every vote and this one while substantial is not a huge amount.


[08/14/2021 9:45 AM] Robert K#0722
Just to clarify that is $50k USD worth of Ergs, not 50k Ergs, correct?


[08/14/2021 10:02 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yes so so less than 5k ERGs at today's prices. I wouldn't vote yes either for 50k ERGs.


[08/14/2021 8:54 PM] morphic#4133

We have a user that is stuck in Sigv1. 

I guess the situational awareness on his side is not so great.. 

"I looked into the amount and it looks like 1ERG ~ 909SigRSV. Looks like 1783969 = 1962.56ERG"

How are we handling the exit from the v1 contract at this point.


[08/24/2021 10:00 AM] Justin1000#9555
Given the higher ERG price and the hopefully imminent set up of the legal entity, I think we need to reconsider compensation. Some initial thoughts from me:
-I feel as though the pure role of being Director/Board Member of Foundation is NOT a full-time job. Rather something that requires like 5-10 hours a week and consists on approving and debating use of treasury funds along with some strategic planning. This is the only formal role I anticipate doing myself and probably this applies to others like Robert and Noah as well. Of course, I may end up spending significantly more than 5-10 hours and will look to do other things too for Ergo but in terms of things actually accountable for and responsible for this would probably be it

-This role though should get some compensation I think. Not sure what that is and I am not concerned about it from personal perspective but still seems necessary. Ideally it would be denominated in USDT terms but could be paid in ERG. Maybe like $[50]k a year or something‚Ä¶but I dunno.  (personally I consider stuff done-to-date mainly volunteer-like basis as ERG price was so low for most of that time it wasn‚Äôt material for me although of course in hindsight the price rose greatly so did very well anyway‚Ä¶). I guess could consider just being volunteer basis‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt care myself.

-Other people who happen to be Foundation Board members seem to have other more time consuming roles with accountability outside of the role of Foundation Board Member ‚Äì this includes:
-Kushti and Morphic as core developers
-Armeanio as head of Biz Dev


[08/24/2021 10:00 AM] Justin1000#9555
These roles should be separately compensated in addition to the Board Member role they perform (probably significantly higher for most part) and regarded similar to full-time positions in marketing or whatever else roles the Foundation hires or employs contractors for

Probably we need to do some collective thinking of what is fair compensation for these type of roles‚Ä¶

I'll gladly vote to pay him, just not clear if that conflicts with what he wants. (unless I am misremembering)


[08/25/2021 6:57 AM] Justin1000#9555
Okay. I am not too worried about it to be honest. Just want to make sure people who are doing all the great work recently are well rewarded and motivated as Foundation finally has real money. But seems everything is going well...

I propose to draw 300 Ergs from the Special Operations budget to send to Eva for China Community spendings. Eva will use these Ergs for future payments to contributing Chinese community members.

Note
Last year I sent (from my own Ergs) total 800 Ergs to Eva to be used for China community. She has proven trustworthy, and used most of those Ergs already, details (rough) as per attached. Payments so far have been to community members Pie, Up, Tongtong and Dr. Wong, for translation, website work, QQ groups, WeChat groups, etc. To clarify, I am not (and will not in the future) asking for reimbursement of the 800 Ergs I sent Eva last year.  These new 300 Ergs from the Special Operations budget would be for ongoing future payments. Will keep a detailed record of spendings.

Sounds good to me. I don't think need that detailed record but guess is good if not too much trouble. From what I see she is really good at getting most out of these. Only a native Chinese plugged into the ecosystem in China like she is can do so.

I will be trying to drop as many exchange offers as I can put together on ErgoForum. I am not attached to any particular outcome just going to start aggressively collecting offers.


[09/08/2021 6:43 AM] Justin1000#9555
Sounds good. I will likely support any top 10 exchanges. Probably cost will be high but it is what it is and still won‚Äôt be near as costly as the equivalent to a Company doing an IPO on the NASDAQ!

As to small exchanges, I would probably only support the ones that offer something unique like a regional exchange. The reason is not cost but team time and resources. Those exchange integrations and marketing take a lot of time and some of their teams suck taking even more time (especially Kushti‚Äôs)

Anyway, totally agree with your approach to just throw everything onto the forum for people to review. Sounds exciting.

Exchanges in my opinion remain the most important single thing for the Foundation to deal with and is the most direct way to boost adoption and price.


[09/08/2021 6:46 AM] Armeanio#0321

Nope. Never responded to my emails. Not sure what the problem is as they seemed keen judging by their initial response. Guess I can shoot them another email. My friend at OKEX is not in the listing department so I don't think can get any more from her besides that initial intro. Some guy who used to work for them that I met at conference contacted me last few days. I could try using him but don't see the point given already got the intro and initial response from their listing dept (shirley). And guys like that annoyingly might want some fee paid to them for their efforts.

ZB is an option waiting for a quote from them. 

Kraken, I am waiting for the application to be completed before submission. It was like 90 pages long. I think having the entitity/liable counterparty will be of benefit.

Sent already? Nothing seems to have went through. Either of those 2 USDT ERC-20  addresses in emails should be fine although the one in the latest email is preferred. thanks  this one...: 0x1d4faCd079ebfb11E1ef0B39895bAd0752b6526C

5 voted "yes", seems to be passed. Will inform Benjamin about it.
@Armeanio please contact Benjamin for legal documents he needs. Maybe, as a future director of EF, you can sign a document with him now, which can later be transferred to EF. I remember Justin wrote about such an option we have while still being incorporating the legal entity.

Some recent spendings made:


[10/21/2021 7:16 PM] kushti#0978
anon_br - 2550 SigUSD (regular payment, but his bill is about $400 now, so paid a lot in advance)
apextheory - 510 SigUSD (irregular, Docker image PR)
pragmaxim - 2040 SigUSD (irregular, for contributions for 4.0.15 node release)
Bitcoin.com merch compensation - 300 SigUSD (irregular)


[10/22/2021 2:24 PM] morphic#4133
Yes, and it is better to have a table with the current montly payments to facilitate the discussion. 
@Armeanio any news about hiring a treasurer?


[10/22/2021 4:32 PM] Armeanio#0321
Yes, we have interviewed a treasurer and proposed a path foward.

The first task will be a bounty to collect organize and document our current payments and run analytics. At this stage things are getting organized on Alex‚Äôs end., we have not started. 

The second will be to port this information to Cryptio and Xero which is the accounting software used by our partners in Singapore. 

I think it best to maintain both as one can be used for forecasting/analytics and the other is for accounting purposes.

Ergo Platform Budgeting initiatives

I conducted a budget for marketing initiatives 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zjWjPo-kkSTI60ksBYO5_mQUZap-oEDLsdynX5_83mo/edit#gid=0

and the EF confirmed it on the previous week 
we eon't do everything at once as it's too hard due to our team and i'll make it step-by step 
so first initiative is to run a crowd marketing campaign for Twitter and Telegram to increase metrics 

then will start influence marketing for Twitter 
on a par with that i'll prepare a PR campaign 

+ working on a content marketing
started a contributor program and now we have first texts 
so Sean has to edit them and then will start medium and telegram blog ( hopefully ü§û) 

also we need traffic campaign as we need advertising, but not now, because im almost dying with all that stuff

+ i started a document with value propositions 
but still require much work to customize it with technologies of ergo 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G3NgdsG2EnYh--WlH9DdzUMiLHVr1kFrvAJZkWtgSTo/edit

on a par with that preparing a presentation of Ergo to pitch to possible partners as Frankfurt blockchain school and other research centers 
need to have 1-2 pager pdf file, select a list of possible connections through linkedin and crunchbase 

my problem is that we need two pitch decks: for developers and for business partners/ investors separately 
so it will take some time 

but feel free to add or comment on right in the document

Could we put some bounties up on the explorer-backend issues? @MrStahlfelge says he's struggling with it - issues have been open for months, he says he can fix it himself next year but would be good to have a set budget allocated for core-devs to chuck on repo's that need love.

Spending look reasonable. I think the last 300 was used so quickly mainly because the low erg price and also the unexpected necessity to buy the Jinse account.

But can we just give her 300 ERGs from now and ask her to try and make it last? Want to be careful not to encourage her to spend too much right now while price is low. 

Also should probably put her monthly bonus down to around 50 ERG level for now.

Added feedback from Ilya on Josef Koval's Scala interview. https://www.ergoforum.org/t/hire-josef-koval-as-a-full-time-scala-developer/3029
I'm now quite confident in his skills and will assign him ErgoScript related tasks. 
@Armeanio I think we should send him a formal offer, because he need to resign, register a business etc. 
From Josef:
"Notice period [for resignation] here is 2 months, starting from end of month when you resign (3 months worst case scenario). I can promise to work full time since beginning of February, as I have some unspent holidays. I can imagine starting to working partially (50%) sometimes during January"

Hi all, from January 2022 I would like to resume already forgotten practice of receiving monthly compensation for development. I'm not sure I will be able to work full-time every month, some months may be more and some maybe less. On average I plan to work around 120 hours/month. 
I was first thinking about time based compensation, similar to how other guys (Benjamin, anon-br, Josef, Monye) are working, but who will check and approve my timesheet? 
Alternatively, we can agree on some average monthly hours I'm expected to work and I will try not to deviate too much.
We also need to agree on the hourly/monthly rate. I  can be flexible about USD/ERG proportion but would prefer to fix the rates for 1 year.
What do you guys think and how we should proceed with this?

[03/25/2022 1:40 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah was having problems. Regarding the debit card I took a prelim look. 

Does the funds stay in ERG up until spending? Seems to imply 3 type of cards:
1. Unbanked Debit Card: says stays in crypto until transaction but doesnt say if that is original crypto used to fund card
2. Unbanked blockcard: says converts crypto to unbanked tokens.
3. Unbanked card: says converts crypto to stable coin.

Dont think we should bother if we are just giving ppl another way to sell ERG for a crappy eth token or some stable coin. But if it is ERG backed up until transaction that is increasing utility of ERG and interesting. 

Other question is how popular is it? Not sure we should spend money and time on it unless somewhat popular already or good prospects of becoming popular soon.

[03/25/2022 2:39 PM] morphic#4133
Yeah, having a debit card backed by ERG would be really good as long as conversion rate is reasonable. I've recently became unbanked being out of Russia with all my Mastercards became useless. This would be great use case for many unbanked Russian expats. 
So, if Unbanked Debit Card backed by ERG means one can top it up with ERGs directly from Ergo blockchain and the conversion rate is reasonable, I'm fully support this proposal, because it will increase hodling and usage. 
However as Justin mentioned, if it is just another way of selling ERGs then I think doesn't worth spending EF funds.


[03/25/2022 2:43 PM] morphic#4133
I have positive experience with Bankoff where I can use  USDT from my wallet to top up the USD balance and spending it via virtual Visa card. Would love to see something like this based on ERGs.

I think regarding Huobi main thing is to nail down final terms and get listing done ASAP and not be too hung up on the amount itself - their behavior is annoying to say the least but this listing is very important for further legitimazation of Ergo in eyes of industry, for market access and to show community we are making real progress on exchanges.

Great news on Kraken. Fully support doing whatever we can to get on there after Huobi.

[05/25/2022 8:08 AM] Justin1000#9555
I took a relatively quick read through it and had attached brief comments on getting account open ASAP and on specifying marketing budget can be paid in ERGs.

I suggest @Armeanio once you have read through it and made any changes you deem necessary to sign and make payment ASAP. No need to wait for others if they have not reviewed by COB Friday. Its standard agreement and I think urgent to get this done. Also, should look to make payment as soon as possible too because there is some risk the price drops even further meaning the deposit of $300k could get really expensive in ERGs. Great deal they are giving us too.

@Stacie  should probably start on opening the Ergo Foundation account with Huobi immediately if not done already. And then push for listing to happen as soon as that is done.


[05/25/2022 8:12 AM] Justin1000#9555
Not sure on our USDT balance but guess we can consider making payment in USDT instead of ERG given low price. But concerned that would deplete our USDT balance too much. Already think we should probably cut back on marketing and other expenses. In theory though, the price should go up post listing so could liquidate some ERG after the listing to replenish balance. Guessing just paying ERG best option though.

[08/14/2022 7:40 PM] glasgowm#9381
Hasn't sent it in yet, this is a bounty request for the content he's already produced


[08/15/2022 1:26 AM] Armeanio#0321
That seems a bit weird... 

So he wants funding after he finished? Idk if that makes much sense. Nobody asked him to contribute.


[08/15/2022 1:28 AM] Armeanio#0321
Considering the amount of community that give support and ask nothing idk I think it sets a negative precedent. 

Could use ladopixel as a good example.


[08/15/2022 1:30 AM] Armeanio#0321
I think the better option is to fund the sigmanaut program and let them manage a grant.


[08/15/2022 9:11 AM] glasgowm#9381
That's how the bounties work generally. Usually pre-defined tasks but there's an option to submit a request too like he's done.


[08/15/2022 9:13 AM] glasgowm#9381
Anything educative to the community is subject to some bounty. This was stated for tutorials but don't know why it wouldn't apply here. 

What about ladopixel? It's good that's he's been able to continue making them without funding but that'd be an easy yes if he requested some support.

[08/16/2022 11:53 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah kinda what I was expecting, bit vague - CW/Sigmanauts should cover most of what they're proposing. Probably not enough there for a contracted role - especially if we shift towards DAOs. But then again with the eth merge likely imminent we might need all hands on deck.  

I was going to suggest to him to formalise some of his ideas a bit more and put them through as a raffle so people can see tangible results; and hopefully we can have the @Sigmanauts voting on specific campaigns to be funded soon. We're almost at 40 now and a bit more structured. Maybe time to start putting some proposals to them for a vote. With things that pass coming to the EF for final approval.

[08/16/2022 12:06 PM] glasgowm#9381
But on this, if we reject his proposal *and* his bounty request; likely going to be less enthusiastic about being involved. The way I see it is if a community member had came to us 6mo ago with a grant request promising to make 20 videos each 1-2hrs, organise and promote them for 1k ERG we'd be daft not to to take it. Views aren't fantastic but with a bit of guidance (shorter vids, teasers, etc) could do well imo. 

I think he did come to us a few months ago asking for funding and we told him 'Proof of Work' - and he has put in the hours. If people aren't keen to award retroactively then we need some other concrete incentive for him as even tho he appears to be a bit abrasive I think he's a good asset in an area we are lacking. Maybe ask him to resubmit as a grant request? (1k erg for x videos, promotions, etc).


[08/16/2022 12:41 PM] glasgowm#9381
We also have anon_reals raffle with 1 day to go at about 60% funded. Not sure if we'd want to top it up or have him resubmit. (Probably didnt do as well as last one as he hasn't released anything since last raffle, team/timeline/roadmap unknown, etc)

[08/17/2022 3:49 PM] Justin1000#9555
Think was mentioned yesterday that maybe anon real would fund it himself because he already had raised enough due to the higher ERG price.

Maybe you can take out whatever is yours and we can replenish it via liquidations? Price not too high but its also not so low we shouldn't be able to do that at least.


[08/21/2022 2:53 PM] Armeanio#0321

Just provide us with an number I think it is very reasonable you are covered for carrying everything as long as you have.


[08/22/2022 5:23 AM] Justin1000#9555
Once we know exact USDT balance EF has on hand maybe we should do a vote for 1) liquidating ~40k ERGs (maybe Kairon can do it before they leave) and 2) sell ERGs om montly basis to cover whatever USDT was spent the previous month. Probably Anastasia could just tell the MM the target amount every month and they could take care of it the following month in a efficient manner.

@everyone -> should get Ergohack VI funding from EF side allocated ASAP.  Causing needless delay in marketing the hackathon and probably pushing back Hackathon date and impacting overall Ergo marketing. Please vote.

If our typical aim is 4 hackathons / year think we stick to it that plan for now. Price could go higher anytime and we have SPF tokens incoming. If situation doesn‚Äôt improve on budget in next 3-6 months only then settle for just 3.

@Stacie Note that all 3 of above should be considered approve per voting. So we need to reflect the new salary payments for @glasgowm and Ben  S. I think Ben S. maybe no change for this month if he still worked full-time last month, else it needs to be reduced to reflect part-time schedule. Somebody will have to confirm. But @glasgowm pay at least should be increased to new level starting next payment.

@kushti as mentioned in forum, for relationship reasons  I don't like the idea of turning down the first small request of Spectrum but maybe you got really valid reasons. Anyway, you need to also consider the relationship aspects of these things. This is their first request and not precedent setting as obviously one-off but yeah you may have valid concerns.

Eva can help but I can also look for someone to do full time (run into ppl here all the time doing marketing). And soon we can even consider a joint partnership with say Jinse. Whats good for Spectrum is good for us and I doubt they have any idea how to do get the China marketing off the ground .

HK going to be HUGE on crypto. China likely going to be back to huge degree. Anyone serious in China wants to do crypto and has a lot of money can move to HK. Also, I am in Shenzhen now, right across border. Will be lots going on here too as they can cross border anytime to do stuff in HK and have joint offices. **So we need to start thinking about getting our partnership back with Jinse and any roadshow should include HK for sure. **

@Armeanio, what is your take on this? Note, on the prior EF call, me and kushti suggested to not be in directors and/or members of the enitity (for various reasons), in particular because the main funds will be in the DAO. Thus the new entity will have higher chance of getting bank account.

probably found wechat account. Li Sha. She was our first China community manager and lives in Belgium. I have offered her 800 ERGs from EF. I will put to vote as soon as confirmed. Will mean I saved EF ~800 ERGs because Up, our only other option wanted like $3k. And also I feel his account is riskier because that guy does all kinds of random crypto promotion in China. Anyway, I will put this to vote as soon as confirmed and hope can get approved ASAP. To be honest should have got this handled a week ago...looking a little inefficient in front of An Xinxin but I have been so distracted.

Li Sha maybe able to help other things too in future. She is UX designer now and turns out she has been closely following Ergo all this time and I didn't even know it.
