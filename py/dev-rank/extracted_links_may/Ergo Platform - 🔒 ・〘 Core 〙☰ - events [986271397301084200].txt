So are they sort of sponsoring the event as well? they are offering prizes for people who build multi-chain and involve alephium as part of the build.. so shouldnt this video be published asap so that people know about this? or was it written elsewhere already


[10/05/2022 2:39 PM] AndyLowe#0000
@NoahErgo also did you see ldg was asking why dont we publish the entire ergo course all at the same time. i dont see it as a big issue either way

(re @AndyLowe : *So are they sort of sponsoring the event as well? they are offering prizes for people who build multi-chain and involve alephium as part of the build.. so shouldnt this video be published asap so that people know about this? or was it written elsewhere already*) 
 
 They just provided this, so I’m sharing 
Yes they provide prizes


[10/05/2022 3:10 PM] NoahErgo#0000
(re @AndyLowe : *@NoahErgo also did you see ldg was asking why dont we publish the entire ergo course all at the same time. i dont see it as a big issue either way*) 
 
 Yes i saw that


[10/05/2022 3:10 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I think its okay if we release rest of videos too


[10/05/2022 3:10 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Didnt realize his intention


[10/05/2022 3:11 PM] NoahErgo#0000
(re @AngieHar : **) 
 
 Nice


[10/05/2022 3:13 PM] NoahErgo#0000
@AndyLowe i think lets do what LGD has asked and then alephium video can come after?


[10/05/2022 3:47 PM] AndyLowe#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *I think its okay if we release rest of videos too*) 
 
 Ok so shall I just make them all public now? They can be in ErgoHack playlist and also in their own playlist


[10/05/2022 4:21 PM] AngieHar#0000
(re @AndyLowe : *Ok so shall I just make them all public now? They can be in ErgoHack playlist and also in their own playlist*) 
 
 What else videos do we have?


[10/05/2022 4:22 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Just the alephium one


[10/05/2022 4:29 PM] AngieHar#0000
Maybe release one more part today 
And other two tomorrow


[10/05/2022 4:42 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Would prefer if we respected his wish for it to all be one release. I know it isnt as great for marketing but he out a ton of effort into it and think should respect his intention


[10/05/2022 5:54 PM] CW#0000
@AndyLowe want to set vids to 5, 6, 7pm UTC for remaining crash course vids


[10/05/2022 5:54 PM] CW#0000
i can reschedule the tweets


[10/05/2022 5:55 PM] CW#0000
for Lucas vids


[10/05/2022 5:56 PM] CW#0000
still my preference to release a section a day, keep daily interest/ awareness of the Hackathon


[10/05/2022 7:55 PM] AndyLowe#0000
Sorry I only just saw this, so haven't published them. What shall I do


[10/05/2022 7:59 PM] AngieHar#0000
i’m voting for disctributing within some period of time


[10/05/2022 8:01 PM] CW#0000
Keep the crash course ones as is. so there is no radio silence on the Hackathon. If the Alephium one is ready we can send that out


[10/05/2022 9:21 PM] AndyLowe#0000
ok


[10/05/2022 9:22 PM] AndyLowe#0000
but @NoahErgo already told lgd on discord that it would be made into one playlist as he seems to think its quite important


[10/05/2022 9:26 PM] AndyLowe#0000
I feel like we could keep it how it is, and tell lgd that as soon as they are all available they will also be in their own playlist


[10/05/2022 9:46 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Sorry busy at work


[10/05/2022 9:46 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Should have bit my tongue


[10/06/2022 10:12 AM] AngieHar#0000
@AndyLowe Andy, could you please duplicate a schedule, I’m a bit confused 
And when does alephium’s video go live?


[10/06/2022 12:11 PM] AndyLowe#0000
Regarding the ergo crash course vids: I think we are sticking to releasing them 1 each day. So yesterday was part 1, today part 2, tomorrow part 3 and then on Oct 8th, part 4.

Alephium video I don't know when, maybe 9th?


[10/06/2022 12:11 PM] AndyLowe#0000
Or do we want that Alephium video sooner?


[10/06/2022 12:14 PM] CW#0000
I think we do Alephium sooner. Some stage tomorrow as we have part 2 of the crash course and AMA today


[10/06/2022 12:37 PM] AndyLowe#0000
Ok


[10/06/2022 2:20 PM] AndyLowe#0000
Alephium is scheduled for 14.00 utc today
https://youtu.be/2Y39exF3tMo


[10/06/2022 5:45 PM] AngieHar#0000
@AndyLowe @seedubya Alephium confirmed participation in AMA on the 20th of October


[10/06/2022 5:45 PM] AngieHar#0000
Flux can’t confirm the available dates yet since their presenters are in vegas


[10/07/2022 12:41 AM] AndyLowe#0000
OK. its honestly fine anyway if its only alephium, we could do Flux the week after maybe?


[10/07/2022 12:42 AM] AndyLowe#0000
but if we have both at the same time, we might want to make the AMA longer than usual, so they can all get enough time to speak and not just be listening to the other


[10/10/2022 3:28 PM] AngieHar#0000
@seedubya Alephium and Flux confirmed their participation in thrursday’s ama in our youtube channel 
1pm UTC 

30-40 min panel discussion 
and then questions from the community

i’m also discussing a panel discussion for the 18th 
how does it sound?


[10/10/2022 6:45 PM] AngieHar#0000
@Ceilican Bruno, would you like to participate in a panel discussion?


[10/10/2022 6:46 PM] Ceilican#0000
(re @AngieHar : *@Ceilican Bruno, would you like to participate in a panel discussion?*) 
 
 About which topic?


[10/10/2022 6:49 PM] AngieHar#0000
(re @Ceilican : *About which topic?*) 
 
 for now checking the availability
we can brainstorm the topic, depends on who will participate


[10/10/2022 6:51 PM] Ceilican#0000
Tuesdays and Wednesdays are difficult days for me, because of many meetings. A panel on Monday, Thursday or Friday woyld be better for me.

How does final submission work for the hackathon teams? @AngieHar @glasgowm


[10/16/2022 4:04 PM] AngieHar#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *How does final submission work for the hackathon teams? @AngieHar @glasgowm*) 
 
 They will have 4 days to prepare presentations and documentation+ interim reports
They will need to submit it in their chatrooms I guess, or we can send a google drive


[10/16/2022 4:05 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I think just asking them to submit in the channel is ok.


[10/16/2022 4:05 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Would you like me to share a reminder for everyone in the hackathon-chat with this info?


[10/16/2022 4:06 PM] AngieHar#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *Would you like me to share a reminder for everyone in the hackathon-chat with this info?*) 
 
 I was planning to drop an announcement with the link to interim report and reminder on Monday

Sounds good, thank you Angie!


[10/17/2022 3:54 PM] AngieHar#0000
@seedubya @AndyLowe Alephium will be guests on our thursday’s ama


[10/17/2022 4:20 PM] AngieHar#0000
Cheng Wang, a founder and core developer will participate from Alephium


[10/18/2022 2:14 AM] AndyLowe#0000
(re @AngieHar : *Cheng Wang, a founder and core developer will participate from Alephium*) 
 
 Cool. No probs


[10/18/2022 7:51 AM] NoahErgo#0000
@AngieHar we have had a few participants deploy their dapps on flux. This is great news for the partnership


[10/18/2022 3:56 PM] AngieHar#0000
hi team
need your thought on this 

>> Flux: We were thinking to give the projects a littl more time to deploy their applications on the Flux Cloud. Let me know what you think 
would be appreciated if you could announce that we're giving them 10 more days until the October 26th to deploy on Flux


[10/18/2022 3:57 PM] AngieHar#0000
to my mind all the projects have to have equal conditions since it’s a competition 
and after the ergohack is completed they can continue working with these projects 

but please let’s discuss such possibilities, maybe we can find a common ground


[10/18/2022 3:57 PM] AngieHar#0000
@seedubya @NoahErgo


[10/18/2022 4:02 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I think it is a bad idea to change the rules to fit what a sponsor wants. And anyway projects were not required to launch on flux


[10/18/2022 4:04 PM] NoahErgo#0000
and anyway most projects are not in a complete state where they could launch on flux either


[10/18/2022 4:05 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I guess for their special prize they can make the rules as they want, which is okay somehow. But I agree it was not a rule to deploy on flux, often participants don't have something complete anyway


[10/19/2022 3:23 PM] AngieHar#0000
@AndyLowe Andy, could you please share a link to tomorrow’s ama


[10/19/2022 3:23 PM] AngieHar#0000
and if you have a zoom link in advance please share too


[10/19/2022 3:24 PM] AngieHar#0000
@NoahErgo a quick question, do we have any videos for closing the hack? from kushti or smbd else?


[10/19/2022 3:47 PM] NoahErgo#0000
We do not

(re @NoahErgo : *I am at work currently*) 
 
 ah, no problem 
i’m creating a form for judging basing on the spreadsheet 
but i think i got the idea already, and will send here when it’s updated


[10/20/2022 11:05 PM] AngieHar#0000
hi team 

i have updated the tracking spreadsheet about hackathon participants 
so all the info is here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iMxAhFhh0Si6ptydqtwa0T66h7rXE-GrWwY8UHaCd5o/edit#gid=0

the tab «Summary Board» shows the list of participants and indicates whether they have fulfilled all the conditions of the competition

participants were required to provide us with two interim reports and upload their solutions

the following teams *did not send* solutions
`raptor-mining
ergonames
sigma-balls
satergo
mine-ergo`

thus, only 10 teams can move on in the voting

@glasgowm Mark, could you please take a look and check the spreadsheet before sending the form to judges? Just to make sure i didn’t miss anyone 
or can anybody else assist? 

and here is the form for judges https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KK6TO-M6otD1Y8O5hBFUAN5xM8xBXBgEl2jPUusyDcg/prefill
also can be checked 

please feel free to comment on

[10/20/2022 11:08 PM] AngieHar#0000
and additionally, Flux still negotiates and wants to give time for 4 projects to deploy on Flux for 10 days more 
i gave them my opinion and shared our voting outcome too, but i assume they don’t want to push the prizes until projects complete the development 

any thoughts?


[10/21/2022 12:45 AM] CW#0000
there was no prerequisite or condition of having to have a project deploy on flux, it was encouraged. 20% of of the projects chose to do so. its my opinion not to extend, kind of gives an unfair advantage of potential prize who didnt do so initially

[10/26/2022 4:03 PM] AngieHar#0000
i’m afraid that we are not able to announce the winners tomorrow because we have just 3 answers so far 
i pinged partners too, but it requires at least one day to analyse all the results we get, especially with their comments, to prepare a blog post announcement etc


[10/26/2022 4:07 PM] AngieHar#0000
so far we have two answers from Alephium
one judge from Flux left 
and waiting the voice of EF and Djed 

@seedubya CW, could we announce in twitter that it’s going to be delayed 
i’m worring that participants will be frustraited if we don’t alert in advance

one judge from Flux left 
and waiting the voice of EF and Djed 

@seedubya CW, could we announce in twitter that it’s going to be delayed 
i’m worring that participants will be frustraited if we don’t alert in advance*) 
 
 Sure I'll put something out shortly


[10/26/2022 11:07 PM] AngieHar#0000
Flux’s team completed their vote

I submitted my Hackathon evaluation form. One concern that I have is that, if you simply apply some mathematical formula to the ratings that I and other judges gave to the projects, you are probably not going to get a meaninful result.


[10/27/2022 10:56 AM] Ceilican#0000
If you need more information from me besides the ratings to determine the winners, let me know.


[10/27/2022 11:36 AM] Ceilican#0000
@AngieHar , here is some additional feedback about this hackathon's judging process:

1) Compared to the previous hackathon, this year it was much easier to find information about the projects. Judging felt much less overwhelming. Thank you!

2) I think "innovation" and "scope" should be separate criteria. Often, being innovative means doing something that is out of scope.

3) I think "Urgency for the Ergo Ecosystem" could be another criterion. For example, "Sigma-Rust-JIT" is a project that seems tob e addressing an urgent need, and it would be good to acknoeledge the importance of addressing urgent needs.

4) I think the submissions can be categorized in 3:  a) ongoing long-term projects; b)  short-term projects/features developed specifically for/during the hackathon; c) research papers (possibly with some preliminary/poc implementation).  It can be considered unfair to compare an (a)-type submission with a (b)-type submission. I think hackathons should be primarily about (b).  Projects from categories (a) and (c) should probably have a separate venue. For instance, there could be a remote "Ergo Workshop" for (c)-type submissions. (a)-type projects could receive longer-term grants, or could be encouraged to submit clearly scoped "features" to hackathons.

5) I found a (0--3) range for interface quality too narrow. It forces many projects to have the same interface quality rating, even if there are differences in quality between them. For example, I may want to give a rating of 1.6 to project A and 1.9 to project B, to show that B is better than A. But the rating system would force me to give a rating of 2 to both of them, making them indistinguishable from an interface quality point of view.

6) On the other hand, I found a (0-7) range for level of completed implementation too wide.  I would prefer to have just a 0-4 range here: 0 for "not started", 1 for "some implementation done", 2 for "almost <clipped message>


[10/27/2022 11:36 AM] Ceilican#0000
11) I think "Difficulty" or "Ambition" could be another criterion. It is easier to score high on "quality of code", quality of user interface" and "level of completed implementation", if I choose a very simple project. I might score higher than a harder more ambitious project that, because of its difficulty, has issues with quality and completion. But does this mean that I should win the hackathon? Probably not necessarily. A "difficulty" or "ambition" criterion could help.


[10/27/2022 3:13 PM] AngieHar#0000
Bruno, thanks a lot for your comment, will definately take into consideration


[10/27/2022 4:33 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Yes, on next round will try to implement some of these ideas!


[11/01/2022 7:43 PM] AngieHar#0000
@NoahErgo hey Noah, are you available now?


[11/01/2022 7:51 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I am working


[11/01/2022 7:58 PM] NoahErgo#0000
@AngieHar whats up?


[11/01/2022 8:00 PM] AngieHar#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *I am working*) 
 
 okay, no problem 
i’m trying to create a pivote table for ergohack, to count resuls
so now i guess i have another idea, but i do it manually, so i thought maybe you know how to create this one automatically out from the results 

and yet they are probably not final results


[11/01/2022 8:00 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Hmmm i dont think i would know how to actually


[11/01/2022 8:01 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Maybe @glasgowm or @seedubya might know they are both pretty clever with this kind of stuff

and that’s what i would like to discuss with someone, what specifically we summarize 
so we do not point out judges, correct? 
and then summarise all the totals of innovations, quality of code, etc separately?

so i mean which parameters should be x and y

I've done a fair but with pivot tables in Office though haven't played in sheets or libre office with them. Assume they'd act the same maybe just some layout differences


[11/01/2022 8:29 PM] AngieHar#0000
Or we can make quotes for any future content, if judges are okay with that

hi team, so let's go over the conditions of the hackathon once again 

Teams are evaluated according to 4 main criteria
Each criteria has a certain maximum number of points
Teams who receive the maximum number of points according to 4 specified criteria get their prize pool 

If everyone is satisfied with this statement and we are on the same page, then I have calculated the results and we have winners of the fifth hackathon 

1st place goes to CYTI
2nd place goes to ergonames
3rd place is for paizo

Judges who voted in the judging process: 

Mikaël Vaivre Alephium 
h0ngcha0 Alephium 
Tadeas Kmenta Flux 
Tim Sulmone Flux 
Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo Djed Alliance
Mark Glasgow EF 
Alexander Chepurnoy EF

Alephium decided to split their prize pool between all the teams equally 

updated the spreadsheet with the new tab «Winners» https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iMxAhFhh0Si6ptydqtwa0T66h7rXE-GrWwY8UHaCd5o/edit?resourcekey=undefined#gid=1462599122

additionally, preparing a wrap up of the hackathon, can include quotes from judges’ comments on teams
if we are not waiting for other judges and go ahead, these results can be announced tomorrow 

let me know your thoughts

And additionally, want to ask our EF members, whether it’s possible to give additional prizes to all teams that we had been doing the previous time ( like 200 SigUSD to all active participants) 
there is not a great amount of teams, but great solutions and judges admitted this
but additonal prizes from Ergo for those who didn’t win but spent two weeks working on their projects for the ecosystem, can be addtional motivational point to participate in the future hacks

Hi all, we are going to host a mini summit on the weekend of November 26/27 with the topic Mining and Minting following ErgoHack V with aim of highlighting participant proposals.

So far we have confirmation from 
SNISP
Ergo Payroll
EIP-38 Partial Voting
CYTI
DumDumDum (Ergo Twitter)
Ergo Audit
ErgoNames
Paizo

Kushti has expressed interest recording his presentation recently given in Dubai, @kushti_ru please confirm subject/topic

At this stage I think we only require intro/outro videos

Aiming to receive final content by 21st Nov (earlier the better) to allow time for editing

Tadeas Kmenta Flux 
Tim Sulmone Flux 
Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo Djed Alliance
Mark Glasgow EF 
Alexander Chepurnoy EF
mhs_sam EF 
Joseph Armeanio EF 

I’m going to share the results with our partners to agree when we publish the announcement 

also we need a day to cover it for a news and blog, but the announcement in twitter can go earlier 
or announce it this Thursday on the AMA ( would be best in terms of timing to my mind)

Some of the low scores have no feedback so may make things worse.

Just curious - how were ergo team judges vs our partner judges as for as scoring


[11/17/2022 3:46 PM] NoahErgo#0000
probably has something to do with it if i were to guess


[11/17/2022 3:47 PM] Armeanio#0000
Idk I think the scoresheet itself was a bit weird since ui was a consideration.


[11/17/2022 3:47 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Yeah i wanted to remove that altogether


[11/17/2022 3:47 PM] Armeanio#0000
My biggest complaint would be that.


[11/17/2022 3:48 PM] Armeanio#0000
Seems silly.


[11/17/2022 3:48 PM] glasgowm#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *Just curious - how were ergo team judges vs our partner judges as for as scoring*) 
 
 ergo-audit got 2 low scores from bruno/mikael (4/8 on code) but havent looked much beyond that


[11/17/2022 3:49 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Only reason ui stayed is that partners already advertised rubric so we weighted it very low only 3 possible points


[11/17/2022 3:49 PM] NoahErgo#0000
but yes next time i would like to remove it


[11/17/2022 3:49 PM] glasgowm#0000
seems they might’ve lost a few points as not related to mining/theme


[11/17/2022 3:49 PM] glasgowm#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *Only reason ui stayed is that partners already advertised rubric so we weighted it very low only 3 possible points*) 
 
 yeh that was hard to answer


[11/17/2022 3:49 PM] NoahErgo#0000
scores shouldnt be related to theme i guess though


[11/17/2022 3:50 PM] Armeanio#0000
(re @glasgowm : *seems they might’ve lost a few points as not related to mining/theme*) 
 
 That was something I considered. Idk should I not have?


[11/17/2022 3:50 PM] glasgowm#0000
Seems they interpreted the ‘scope’ question as scope within the theme


[11/17/2022 3:50 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I see


[11/17/2022 3:50 PM] glasgowm#0000
(re @Armeanio : *That was something I considered. Idk should I not have?*) 
 
 Usually it is I believe from remembering past judgings


[11/17/2022 3:51 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Well next time can clarify i guess. Just feel slightly weird given that my team was a winner and also i designed the rubric hope that wasnt some kind of conflict of interest


[11/17/2022 3:52 PM] glasgowm#0000
Scored highly on scope probably as related pretty directly to mining


[11/17/2022 3:56 PM] glasgowm#0000
‘Quality of Code’ is also hard to answer as a small amount of well documented code will score higher than lots of complex code explained poorly.


[11/17/2022 3:58 PM] NoahErgo#0000
On next go feedback on judging rubric is welcome would love to make it better


[11/17/2022 3:58 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Bruno had some good feedback above as well


[11/17/2022 3:59 PM] NoahErgo#0000
felt a bit backed into a corner on this one trying to tweak weighting because stuck with a wonky rubric

 These numbers also don’t seem to match up with the actual votes? ie CYTI says 71 points for innovation scope but the results say 9+9+9+9+7+7+6+6, or 62

 I didn’t change any numbers 
The spreadsheet is automatic
I just sum the result 

Where did you find that?

I don’t know 
It’s all seems correct 
Check responses by individuals


[11/17/2022 4:38 PM] AngieHar#0000
It reflects correctly if you check all judges separately 
The point in the form and the point reflected in the spreadsheet


[11/17/2022 4:38 PM] AngieHar#0000
(re @glasgowm : **) 
 
 Plus Joseph didn’t use the form

right well thats what it is then

Forwarded from ErgoBridgeBot: <Cheese Enthusiast> Will the grading rubrics by all judges be released? Was hoping to do better, but it is what it is.


[11/18/2022 12:18 PM] glasgowm#0000
Forwarded from ErgoBridgeBot: <Cheese Enthusiast> I personally haven’t received anything yet. Would be nice to know where I did badly. Not to mention many days+nights of work, so would be good to see where I messed up compared to others.


[11/18/2022 12:18 PM] glasgowm#0000
Forwarded from chemmka: still looks like magic to me how the judges dealt with it. 
In any case, can I somehow challenge the decision of the judges and ask for any comments on certain judicial articles? How and where is it best to do this?


[11/18/2022 12:19 PM] glasgowm#0000
What’s the plan here then? Seems Cheese’s project in particular did get nerfed.


[11/18/2022 12:23 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I somehow had access to the sheet and many judges noted obolflip had no UI. Helped them a lot with their UI and I've seen it for sure :-)
But opening the sheet will ask for a lot of challenges like that. So I would not do it. Instead, we should perhaps define some more what s hackathon project is. It seems a good idea is more successful than a good implementation of a common idea. Which to some degree is okay for research projects, but when it comes to me a hackathon is more about implementing something. To add this, a centralized structure is not worth any price but that's just me


[11/18/2022 12:37 PM] glasgowm#0000
I agree opening it up fully will just lead to people being hypercritical - not sure what you mean by 'a centralized structure is not worth any price but that's just me’ though. 

Thinking a summary of comments + maybe total score for each category is probably okay? 

SNIPs had spoiled votes though so does seem unfair to include them. @AngieHar can you share the full sheet with me so I can see if it would’ve made a difference.

 If I understood correctly ergonames uses a centralized backend and keys for their solution, that's what I meant

up to EF members what to do now I think @glasgowm @Armeanio @seedubya


[11/21/2022 8:44 PM] AngieHar#0000
And one more thought 
Alephium will distribute their prize pool equally between all teams 
And Djed Alliance doesn’t provide with prizes 

So in this case maybe separate teams won from EF and Flux?


[11/21/2022 8:44 PM] AngieHar#0000
And flux will send their prizes just to their three first places

 any feedback on the idea? @seedubya


[11/22/2022 12:10 PM] Ceilican#0000
(re @Armeanio : *Yeah external project judges seem like a bad idea moving forward.*) 
 
 Is it "external judges" a bad idea? Or is it actually "external judges with some potential conflict of interest" a bad idea?


[11/22/2022 12:10 PM] Ceilican#0000
In addition to the feedback that I have already given a long time ago above, here is another one:

* because teams are working on entirely different projects, judging will always be a bit subjective. It is like trying to judge a marathon where each runner can choose in which direction to run. Some teams and judges may think that it is more worthy to run 100km on a  beach, whereas others may think that it is more worthy to climb a 1km high mountain. Aggregating such subjective opinions will lead to seemingly random results and to dissatisfaction among those who have a different opinion about what is more worthy. 

One way to solve this is to change the notion of "winner". Instead of having a "first", "second", "third" place, the hackathon could have (small) prizes for everyone who is deemed to have "crossed the finish line" (in whatever direction they decided to "run") plus some special bonus prizes for special achievements ("longest distance", "highest altitude", or analogously "best documentation", "most in scope", "best UI", "most innovative idea",... ).


[11/22/2022 2:11 PM] Armeanio#0000
(re @Ceilican : *Is it "external judges" a bad idea? Or is it actually "external judges with some potential conflict of interest" a bad idea?*) 
 
 Specifically the flux judges. It very well could be a conflict of interest.


[11/22/2022 2:13 PM] AngieHar#0000
(re @Armeanio : *Specifically the flux judges. It very well could be a conflict of interest.*) 
 
 Can we separate them? So they give their prizes just for those whom they assessed 
And EF will award their winners?


[11/22/2022 2:18 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Just for transparency w you guys - As a participant id rather not comment on this and leave it to EF as it may influence ranking team outcomes and i dont want to do that. Conflict of interest moreso than being involved in creating the rubric


[11/22/2022 7:38 PM] CW#0000
(re @AngieHar : *any feedback on the idea? @seedubya*) 
 
 I don't particularly agree with the idea, we are moving the goalposts to address scrutiny of judging to find an outcome 'we' want and discrediting judges decisions based on the current judging rubric.

In saying that if it means we can finalize this hack and pay out rewards then sure. 

The hack is to be Ergo-centric, judges from our ecosystem know what is good for us, what is needed, what complexities, what's on scope, etc, and imo are in the best position to do so. 
The weight of internal judges needs to far outweigh external to keep this in favor for participants. 

There will always be subjectivity around proposal judging as they're always so differing as Bruno mentioned above

Hi angie I've set dates and requested funding from EF for the first hack already as well as a calendar for time periods. 

A number of proposed topics also to hopefully coincide with product releases - oracles v2, rose bridge etc.


[12/21/2022 4:32 PM] CW#0000
4 hacks, 2 weeks in length seems optimal with opportunity for smaller run initiatives in between - pending fund availability

Time for Ergohack VI!

> Date: Feb 8 - 22 (2 weeks)
> Prize Pool: 18k SigUSD (TBC)
> Judging: Feb 22 - Mar 1
> Announce winners:  Mar 2 at weekly AMA

> There have been a number of suggestions and ideas put forth for topics of upcoming Hackathons and would like to discuss what we, as the EF, would like to see be the focus for ErgoHack VI. 

> Ideas include (to name a few):
> Oracles and DeFi
> Education, Tutorials and Documentation
> Green Button Solutions
> Sigma Protocols and ZKPs
> Grassroots Finance
> Arbitrage/Trading Bots and Off-Chain Solutions
> Hack/Harden Current Projects

> My suggestion for ErgoHack VI is Oracles and Defi. Pending Oracle v2 release, building use and utility around the oracle framework and DeFi utilizing such oracles and open to discuss ideas


[12/21/2022 4:34 PM] CW#0000
Will update when I have PC available


[12/21/2022 4:34 PM] AngieHar#0000
okay got it 
but anyway my ideas are more general, about the structure


[12/21/2022 4:37 PM] CW#0000
Just waiting for EF vote on funding and also release on main net of the options mentioned above to set the theme for Hack VI


[12/21/2022 4:39 PM] AngieHar#0000
cool 
so we can announce all hacks in advance, just need to confirm themes, so they coincide with the dates


[12/21/2022 4:43 PM] CW#0000

 i think oracles and defi is a good idea


[12/31/2022 10:14 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Would allow us the opportunity to provide a nice video overview of the oracles v2 framework, similar to the rosen bridge video that was done


[12/31/2022 10:15 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Not sure if greenhat would be interested in providing this or not. And I know @Armeanio said something about creating a similar dexy overview

Forwarded from kushti_ru: @seedubya @glasgowm @AngieHar on ErgoHack, what about to have it very generic and name just "CypherPunk Finance" ? 

Which may include (but not limited to):
- research in hardening PoW , L2 
- hardware wallets (I know a guy who is working on Tangem impl for example), physical Erg coins 
- cold wallets
- p2p financial instruments
- community finance
- improving on- and off-ramp (Bisq-like contracts by @MrStahlfelge and so on)
- minimizing trust in cross-chain and off-chain solutions
- PoW-Fi
- experiments in tokenomics
- degen finance 

and so on, so basically filling holes and building where we have half-baked stuff already , also, with catchy name

 Theme is more of a guideline usually right? + videos/materials on the topic

> A cypherpunk is any activist advocating widespread use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies as a route to social and political change. Originally communicating through the Cypherpunks electronic mailing list, informal groups aimed to achieve privacy and security through proactive use of cryptography. Cypherpunks have been engaged in an active movement since the late 1980s.

Some resources on the privacy aspect here which I will improve before the hack

I think issue with typeform was probably that entry fields were across multiple pages. If it can all be in one simple form on a single page i think people wouldnt have a problem

 Also reports of submissions not registering or missing. Maybe from not following all the way through as its over multiple pages. Also like the registration form to be available whilst the hack is running

 Cheers, tested again and both went through. After submission what are your thoughts on a redirect to the resources page?


[01/18/2023 11:46 AM] glasgowm#9381
Enabled but makes it unclear it's been submitted. Resources page also outdated

Cypher punks advocate the widespread use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies and are encouraged to explore the realms of web3, defi, x, y, z

Just did another once over of the website, fixed up one or two very minor things 

The link preview text has updated on twitter, still waiting on the image to refresh. TG still waiting for both - just a waiting game i think

@glasgowm on the register form i think change the redirect and have a separate page on WP saying the registration has been successful then a call to action to join the hackathon channel on Discord and provide the link to docs.ergoplatform.org for more info on dev/tutorials etc

Outside of that just the prize pool to update shortly. 

Good job guys

Hi all, looking to lock down judges for the current hackathon. Luivatra is happy to be part of the judging panel from the ErgoPad side seeing as they're sponsoring. @oskin would you be interested as another "independent" judge?

@glasgowm @mhs_sam @kushti_ru @Armeanio I can also ask Anon_Br

Aiming for a quick turn around this time as to not leave participants waiting 3-4 weeks on conclusion of the hack. This one ends on 22nd of Feb and hoping to announce at AMA on the 2nd of March so you'll need to set some time aside to assess the proposals that week


[01/22/2023 10:28 PM] CW#0000
Also on the process of judging...

With the vast and varying projects submitted for assessment throughout the history of ErgoHacks, judges are often left comparing apples to oranges.

We are simplifying the judging process as much as possible and return to the judging process that occured at ErgoHack I. This allows the judges to apply subject relevance and utilise their experience, knowledge and ecosystem awareness to assess and rank by the quality of the submission (ranked-choice voting).

The ranking points accumulated for each submission are then accumulated. The submission with the lowest points accumulated is considered first place, the second lowest is second place and so on.

Not getting much engagement. 

- I’d make the title something more like `Community Chat - Ask us anything on Decentralized Lending Protocols`
- 1 day probably not long enough to get a good set of questions. I’d create a set date, last day of every month or something. Post the thread up ~2wks before to get questions in.

guys, I was going to make the usual video I make to help promote the ergohack, and encourage sign ups etc. but I saw on the website that it says 'will run in partnership with ErgoPad and more TBC!' ...so I was waiting to see what those other partners would be so I could include them. Is there still a prospect of there being other partners?

Hi all we are in the concluding stages of the hackathon, judging sheets have been sent out to @glasgowm @Armeanio @anon_br @oskin and Luivatra. Once completed I'll compile rankings together into one sheet. 

Links to each proposal folder is listed in the sheet to make thinks a little easier or the overall folder is located on the link below. 

We will start to see projects making their submissions now and will chase up any who are lagging a little.

(re @seedubya : *Also on the process of judging...

With the vast and varying projects submitted for assessment throughout the history of ErgoHacks, judges are often left comparing apples to oranges.

We are simplifying the judging process as much as possible and return to the judging process that occured at ErgoHack I. This allows the judges to apply subject relevance and utilise their experience, knowledge and ecosystem awareness to assess and rank by the quality of the submission (ranked-choice voting).

 hey CW, is this judging process relevant? 
will it be any other details on that?

 can i publish this one? 

the only thing i don’t get
so overall judges will give their point from one to 10 to assess the project?


[02/22/2023 9:22 AM] CW#0000
No, the 5 judges will rank projects 1 through 19 (I think was the total number of projects, not at PC). 

The sum of the 5 judge's rank for each project will then determine the winner

@seedubya @AndyLowe have requested from participants we get videos back for the mini summit by wednesday March 8th. Will update notion as we get links in. Currently storing them in the events pipe and as we get links to videos in I will move them to the videos pipe

[02/28/2023 2:55 PM] CW#0000
(re @glasgowm : *Issue is they’re not on the judging criteria. Can you amend @seedubya (if they submitted on time?)*) 
 
 I'll check the time the folder was created and if they registered in the tally form in a sec. If after the 21st they're ineligible. 

If that's the case I think provide some comments but ineligible for ranking points/prizes.

Will confirm and get back mate
