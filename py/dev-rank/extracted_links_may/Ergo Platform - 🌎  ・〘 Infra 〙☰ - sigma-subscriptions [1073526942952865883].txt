Hello @cornbelt tried dming you but was not able to

I am assisting Ergo Foundation with the ergohack and they are gathering participants to see if people would be able to create a video presentation on the project each person has created. Ideally would need to have a video back 2 weeks or so following the hackathon. The videos will be shared publicly on the Ergo youtube channel as a way to share what the community has put together during the event! Would you be able/interested?


[02/20/2023 5:05 AM] cornbelt#7268
Ill dm you

@cornbelt sorry for my laziness, I will dive deeper into papers later. Let me ask for now: does your solution provide to a project to set payment in ERG and a TOKEN?


[02/24/2023 2:46 AM] cornbelt#7268
@yb for the hackathon I just focused on getting a proof of concept so it will only enforce ERG as the payment currently. It should take just a slight modification to allow for tokens as well so I do plan to add that.

I am catching up on your work now, but I actually messaged looking for a team for this exact idea (patreon on Ergo) but got caught up with work. Would love to help in any way possible


[04/11/2023 2:25 AM] lllllll#4485
Ah, just saw that lexton and Jerry_slush replied to me a while back in the i-need-a-team thread. Are they involved in sigma-subscriptions?


[04/11/2023 2:26 AM] lllllll#4485
Sigma Subscriptions is a good name, I was thinking maybe PatrAnon


[04/11/2023 3:23 AM] cornbelt#7268
Would love feedback. Everything is on GitHub, links above
