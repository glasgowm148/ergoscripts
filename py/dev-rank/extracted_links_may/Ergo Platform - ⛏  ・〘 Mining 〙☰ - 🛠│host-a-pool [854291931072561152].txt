@mhs_sam


[06/19/2021 12:07 PM] mhs_sam#1471
imagine you have the full hashrate of the network (all hashrate is yours), so at current difficulty, you will receive ONE share in two minutes (approximately), and this share is actually a valid solution.
so, if you're running a pool and want to receive some shares for your accounting you must mimic the diff for your miners, in order to get shares. These shares are not valid solutions for the network. however at some point one of these shares might be a valid solution for the whole network.


[06/19/2021 12:08 PM] mhs_sam#1471
for example: imagine your hr is 600MH and the net is 14.5TH, so about 25000 times more.
it means that if you set diff=25000, you will receive one share approximately in 2 minutes.
so, set the diff 50000 or 100000 and try again.


[06/19/2021 12:21 PM] mhs_sam#1471
For testing the pool deployment, I recommend using the open source miner. As soon as successful deployment you can switch to any miner.
You can use SRB or Nano miners too. There are some issues with NBminer at the moment.


[06/19/2021 1:34 PM] marcioglaser#3380
Good morning Sam.
I greatly appreciate your answer, it was simple and easy to understand.
Now without abusing your help, I would like to share with you my configuration, so that we can analyze where the DIFF error is, especially for me to understand how this parameter's input format should be.

In Start.js (Stratum Server) these values ‚Äã‚Äãare like minDiff: 8, mxDiff: 512, why not entries with numbers like 50000 of diff? What would be the correct format for this entry?

About miner, I will continue testing only with NV_Miner (open source)

Pool is works.
But only in NV_Miner.

Has anyone got it to work with NanoMiner or NBMiner?
Here in these miners the diff does not accept the pool settings, it is only in the total network diff.

What's the difference when using the other miner? (where's the problem)


[06/22/2021 12:55 PM] nitram147#5106
If you use both miners on "ordinary" pool (not yours) do both miners works?


[06/22/2021 2:08 PM] marcioglaser#3380
NB Miner, NanoMiner work perfectly in other pools. I even use it now mining at Hero Miners.
Why do I need them working in my pool? Because they are the miners available in HiveOS. They are also much better miners than NV_Miner which is open source, and with no improvements.
And as I reported, in the pool created here, only NV_Miner accepts the DIFF settings set in the pool. The other miners don't understand this setting, so it can't do any tasks, doesn't send any shares.


[06/22/2021 2:18 PM] nitram147#5106

Where did you get these numbers from?


[06/22/2021 9:56 PM] nitram147#5106
Based on my understanding this is the setting for shares difficulty, so the miners will not DDoS the pool with extreme amount of low difficulty shares


[06/23/2021 12:31 AM] marcioglaser#3380
As you suggest these adjustments, so that it can work for both miners with 100mh and miners with 1Gh.

And can you then mine with another miner other than NV_Miner?

NFTs can be minted with new blocks. Offering an NFT minting service can offer an additional form of revenue for the pool.
Minting NFTs can also be an incentive for miners; an NFT for each new block found can be given to the miner who found that block for the pool or to a random miner through a lottery system.

[06/23/2021 4:59 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
how much time does it take for the node to synchonize? is it hours or days ?


[06/23/2021 5:01 PM] Nythain#6769
varies. some people report it syncing overnight, others are like "i've been syncing for 20 hours!"

@ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ check output of node.  `.ergo`folder should increase in size

the only thing I worry about is my cats trying to play with my router and get me offline lol


[06/23/2021 5:14 PM] andee#4722
I start and stop my node all the time, that shouldn't be a problem


[06/23/2021 5:14 PM] andee#4722
got a corrupted db once and had to resync the node, but that may be because of improper shutdown


[06/23/2021 5:14 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
so it doesnt reset and syncs from the last time it got offline ?


[06/23/2021 5:15 PM] andee#4722
it checks what you already have synced then continues

i've never understood miningpoolstats honestly. i don't know how or why they have two network hashrates posted, though the one on the left is the exact hashrate reported by ergo explorer, just never understood what hte other one is

@ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ I did `npm install` and it worked fine. for solo mining to node that server is overkill though, you should be able to use https://github.com/mhssamadani/ErgoStratumProxy

Hi
What is the version of your node?

Trying to fully understand pools makes me feel so stupid.


[06/24/2021 9:59 PM] MikeyMike87#9350
Haha same here. I just learned what a share actually is and my mind was blown haha


[06/24/2021 10:02 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
It's crazy advanced. Imagine how hard it was for the first people who setup BTC mining pools with no help, no pre-made pool scripts etc.. slush pool is the first I remember, not sure if the first.


[06/24/2021 10:46 PM] MikeyMike87#9350
Haha right. But that fat 50 Bitcoin reward per block paid off in the end :)

not to mentioned that I had a powerloss and when I tried to restart the node it couldnt read/edit the files on .ergo folder (checked all privilledges no issue there) so I had to delete them and by doing so it just worked (albeit I had to wait for it to sync the 6+GB of data again )


[06/25/2021 9:33 AM] zargarzadehmoein#2928
I mean NodeJs )


[06/25/2021 9:37 AM] zargarzadehmoein#2928
The proxy must be connected to the stratum server, not node


[06/25/2021 1:41 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
yea figured as much I mean its in the title its a proxy to the server the same guys make üòõ But since I never done any of thise and most of it seems strange to me anyway (like WTF is Node.js in the first place for example and why cant it have a better more clarifying name üòõ ) and since @andee who helped me in the past suggested it I thought I give it a try


[06/25/2021 1:43 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
I really am not sure which file you are referring to if I run "npm version" I get this and mentions a node file

Node.js isnt referncing the node. Its a javascript runtime. Its what the server was written in.


[06/25/2021 2:44 PM] zargarzadehmoein#2928
you can use this command:
`node --version`


[06/25/2021 2:45 PM] zargarzadehmoein#2928
@vorujack please check the compatibility of the `bigint` packages used in `package.json` with the Nodejs versions.


[06/25/2021 2:47 PM] vorujack#1729
Please check with node version 14


[06/25/2021 5:54 PM] andee#4722
port 9030 is for mining, you used 9053 which is for the UI


[06/25/2021 5:56 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
tried with node version 14.17.1


[06/25/2021 5:56 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
didnt work


[06/25/2021 5:56 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
but I made progress


[06/25/2021 5:57 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
I noticed that on \ErgoStratumServer\node_modules I had almost no module folders there so nothing like on @marcioglaser  print screen above


[06/25/2021 5:57 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
what I did is dir to the node_modules folder


[06/25/2021 5:58 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
and git clone https://github.com/zone117x/node-stratum-pool node_modules/stratum-pool


[06/25/2021 5:58 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
then when I typed npm update  I was getting an error


[06/25/2021 5:58 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'C:\OpenSSL-Win64\lib\libeay32.lib' [D:\ergo\ErgoStratumServer\node_module
s\bignum\build\bignum.vcxproj]


[06/25/2021 5:59 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
Turns out that libeay32.lib (according to this I read https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55476623/cannot-find-libeay32-lib-and-ssleay32-lib-files-when-setting-up-openssl-on-windo ) is no longer called like it but rather libssl.lib


[06/25/2021 6:00 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
so I copied libssl pasted somehwere else and renamed it as libeay32.lib and pasted it back on the openss-win64\lib\ folder


[06/25/2021 6:00 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
and npm update worked!


[06/25/2021 6:00 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
and also I have bignum and other modules folders under \node_modules


[06/25/2021 6:00 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
I thought I was set now!

[06/25/2021 6:03 PM] andee#4722
you have done so many things that you are not supposed to, like why did you clone another repo into the node_modules folder? start from a fresh clone of the server, then do `npm update`


[06/25/2021 6:03 PM] andee#4722
and the proxy server you setup you tried connecting it to port 9053 of the node, which is wrong


[06/25/2021 6:04 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
I did that because my \ErgoStratumServer\node_modules  had like 3 modules on it


[06/25/2021 6:05 PM] andee#4722
the repo you cloned has none of the modules though


[06/25/2021 6:05 PM] andee#4722

could you just like copy the ErgoStratumServer\node_modules\ modules folder into a zip and upload it pleasE? (only the node_modules folder) I think if I get a working fully rostered set of files itll work


[06/25/2021 6:16 PM] andee#4722
I don't know it that would work, there is something wrong with your node.js setup if `npm update`does not work

it does work now after I renamed that file on the openssl folder

which apparently is a missmatch issue with file versions lol

you git cloned other repos etc. just start from a fresh clone of the actual server

---------
So since I dont have a static ip how would I set some dynamic DNS thing to mine on this node outside my lan ?


[06/25/2021 7:19 PM] andee#4722
you would need to set it up on your router or use a dynamic DNS service provider @ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ

[06/25/2021 7:20 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
the only thing is that I chose freedns and my router needs a hash and dont know how to produce that lol but I am looking into it


[06/25/2021 7:21 PM] andee#4722
you could just run a script on the computer that runs the node and stratum for updating


[06/25/2021 7:22 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
I already lost you, how would my computer that runs the node update my miner for the ip in the first place? üòõ


[06/25/2021 7:23 PM] andee#4722
that's not how it works. you get something like `dj_zorbas.freedns.com` that you connect to


[06/25/2021 7:24 PM] andee#4722
the router or the script on your computer just tells freedns to update what IP it points to


[06/25/2021 7:28 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
yea that's setting up a DDNS service via my router (found the hash btw üòõ ) I just thought when you typed 
 "you could just run a script on the computer that runs the node and stratum for updating"

That you were suggesting an alternative to that


[06/25/2021 7:30 PM] andee#4722
I were suggesting that you can run the script that updates the DNS record on the same computer that you run the node and stratum server, that there is no need to configure it on router level


[06/25/2021 7:32 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
sounds interesting but since I have already setup my rooter and created a subdomain that points to my ip

[06/25/2021 7:36 PM] marcioglaser#3380
Let's try it together.

One step earlier, I think it's easier for you to mine first on the same machine. I did it here. But I was only able to mine using NV_Miner, which is not good.
We need to be able to mine with NanoMiner or NBMiner.


[06/25/2021 7:36 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
Oh dont tell me that! I want to mine with teamredminer


[06/25/2021 7:36 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
now that's a deal breaker


[06/25/2021 7:38 PM] andee#4722
the ip address of the miner does not matter. the only thing that needs to be accessible is the stratum server, so it needs a static lan ip and open port on the router


[06/25/2021 7:40 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
the stratum server has a static LAN ip, but in order to access it outside my lan (the node is on a different building than my miners) I am doing that ddns stuff but @marcioglaser just told me that it works only with NV_miner and I am using teamredminer


[06/25/2021 7:40 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
so all that trouble for nothing üò¶


[06/25/2021 7:41 PM] marcioglaser#3380
Ha so you use AMD right.

Well, I hope you get it, I'm still waiting for help from NVidea.

It only worked with the open source miner (NV_Miner) in the case of the NVidea I have.
For other miners it does not "accept" the Diff settings set in the pool.


[06/25/2021 7:41 PM] andee#4722
you made it seem like the miner not having static ip was a problem


[06/25/2021 7:43 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
I dont remember doing that but incase I did then scratch that, the stratum server has a static lan(localhost), the router managing the lan has not a static public ip  and my mining rigs are outside that lan, so I need a DDNs link that points to the stratum server static lan ip


[06/25/2021 7:44 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
have you tried enabling vardif?


[06/25/2021 7:46 PM] marcioglaser#3380
Yes, dont't work.  Look diff, and don't change to adjust.

diff == network diff on that screenshot


[06/25/2021 7:54 PM] andee#4722
@marcioglaser did you input `4` or `4000000` in the config?


[06/25/2021 7:54 PM] marcioglaser#3380
Exactly, it shouldn't be that big.


[06/25/2021 7:54 PM] marcioglaser#3380
This imput

4000000


[06/25/2021 7:55 PM] andee#4722
so probably as expected then, I dont think the config expects KH

[06/25/2021 7:57 PM] andee#4722
try changing the values to GH not KH


[06/25/2021 7:58 PM] marcioglaser#3380
I believe I've tried other ways, but I'll do it again now.

Anyway, with this entry, so it works perfectly with NV_Miner, I make many valid shares.


[06/25/2021 7:59 PM] marcioglaser#3380
I will try now.

Do you believe the entry would be only 4 or 8 for example?

But I just remembered, who gave me this entry form was one of the DEVs, I'll try to locate it.


[06/25/2021 8:01 PM] andee#4722
`                "minDiff": 8, //Minimum difficulty
                "maxDiff": 512, //Network difficulty will be used if it is lower than this
` is the default values in start.js, so I just assume the input is GH


[06/25/2021 8:06 PM] marcioglaser#3380
Here is:

mhs_sam ‚Äî 19/06/2021

imagine you have the full hashrate of the network (all hashrate is yours), so at current difficulty, you will receive ONE share in two minutes (approximately), and this share is actually a valid solution.
so, if you're running a pool and want to receive some shares for your accounting you must mimic the diff for your miners, in order to get shares. These shares are not valid solutions for the network. however at some point one of these shares might be a valid solution for the whole network.
for example: imagine your hr is 600MH and the net is 14.5TH, so about 25000 times more.
it means that if you set diff=25000, you will receive one share approximately in 2 minutes.
so, set the diff 50000 or 100000 and try again.


mhs_sam ‚Äî 19/06/2021

For testing the pool deployment, I recommend using the open source miner. As soon as successful deployment you can switch to any miner.
You can use SRB or Nano miners too. There are some issues with NBminer at the moment.


[06/25/2021 8:08 PM] marcioglaser#3380
Look this inicial test:

Diff on Pool set: 4

Diff on NV_Miner not correspond

[06/25/2021 8:09 PM] marcioglaser#3380
So I've already tested it with inputs like 4 and 8, but I believe as Sam said, input should be like 4000000 or 8000000


[06/25/2021 8:10 PM] andee#4722
`it means that if you set diff=25000, you will receive one share approximately in 2 minutes.`


[06/25/2021 8:10 PM] andee#4722
1 share every two minutes == net diff


[06/25/2021 8:12 PM] andee#4722
I may try setting up myself later, but he said there was problems with nbminer so I would do the same test on another miner

shouldnt I change that "blake" to autolykos ?


[06/25/2021 8:16 PM] marcioglaser#3380
Well, but the fact is that if you can't mine with NB Miner or NanoMiner, it makes it impossible to connect our RIGs with HiveOS.


[06/25/2021 8:16 PM] marcioglaser#3380
No, Dont't change this

In NV_MIner, 1¬∫ share accepted


[06/25/2021 8:33 PM] marcioglaser#3380
For now OK. There are only very few shares, but work. I prefer more shares, this is just pool adjustment.

I will test now with NB Miner or NanoMiner


[06/25/2021 8:37 PM] marcioglaser#3380
Same pool adjust, not change.

In NB Miner Diff is total network.

you know what ? I read in the js comments that if pool difficulty is too low network difficulty will be used


[06/25/2021 8:41 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
try and set low difficulty numbers to see how that goes like 8 min and 32 max


[06/25/2021 8:41 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
or something like that


[06/25/2021 8:44 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
an other thing you could do (to ensure the issue is related to difficulty and not something else) is to connect to 3256 (static difficulty port)


[06/25/2021 8:45 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
and set that to 8


[06/25/2021 8:45 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
if its not a difficulty issue even if the difficulty is high it should produce shares once in a while (within e.g an hour)


[06/25/2021 8:46 PM] marcioglaser#3380
Already tested values ‚Äã‚Äãlike these, have the prints above.


[06/25/2021 8:48 PM] marcioglaser#3380
In NV_Miner everything works perfectly here. Lots of Shares, the variable diff adjusts from time to time, everything works fine.


[06/25/2021 8:58 PM] zargarzadehmoein#2928
In other official pools, diff is set on the pool server for job and then sent job to the miner in this case, NB Miner, but now in stratum server source code, diff is sent to the stratum proxy and after that in proxy diff adjusted for job taken and sent to the NV_miner.


[06/25/2021 9:01 PM] zargarzadehmoein#2928

[06/25/2021 9:07 PM] marcioglaser#3380
Oops, this could be something new. I'm not sure I don't already have this version here, but I'm going to replace everything. And in this case, NB Miner should connect to Stratum Server normally as I test here correct? Connecting directly to the server on port 3032 and not using Proxy?


[06/25/2021 9:09 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838

with other adjustments, such as diff 8000000 and Var diff as minimum 4000000 and maximum 6000000 also did not work.


[06/25/2021 9:35 PM] zargarzadehmoein#2928
the current code does not work with NbMiner (does not adjust the diff). In the next few days, we will make changes to the code and push it in a separate brunch.


[06/25/2021 9:39 PM] marcioglaser#3380
Wow, I'm sorry. I was very excited that I didn't read correctly that you were still sending it.

Can you please let me know if the input parameter of the Diff values ‚Äã‚Äãshould be like 4, 8, 32 as they are in the Start.js template, or should they be like 4000000, 8000000?


[06/25/2021 9:52 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
I am not sure about the units start.j uses.  generally what I see is a number about 8GH on average per 100Mh/s 

But pool difficulty is kind of irrelevant if you dont plan to host a lot of rigs (like 100 or so) because it mainly is an adjustment on how frequently the rigs communicate with the server, especially in a lan setup with a CPU (on the server side) that is from the past decade and like a 100Mbit lan connection  it wont really be an issue

how can I change the ip of the node ?


[06/26/2021 8:51 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
The reason I ask that is that I transfered the node in a computer within the lan


[06/26/2021 8:52 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
the issue though is that the miner cant connect to local host (127.0.0.1) which also the ip that the proxy opens on port 3000


[06/26/2021 8:52 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
(tried also the stratum server ports )


[06/26/2021 8:53 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
and I believe that is because local host of the rig is also 127.0.0.1 (can't change that because its hibe OS and doesnt allow that it is also mentioned in the etc config file of hive OS ) @zargarzadehmoein


[06/26/2021 8:54 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
so I assume it tries to connect to its own localhost instead of the one that runs the node and the stratum server


[06/26/2021 8:57 PM] marcioglaser#3380
Someone should help you.
I don't know enough about networking, so I'm running my tests on a single machine running server, proxy and miner.

When I get this to work normally, then I'll have help to host the pool on a server.


[06/26/2021 8:58 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
Hi Marcio, I noticed that you use a different link on your screenshots to connect (were the miner reposts it connected to the server) how did you do that ? can you remember ?


[06/26/2021 9:42 PM] marcioglaser#3380
This link is when I test with the developer who is working on this process with me. That link (must be the http://damacenohomerouter you are talking about) is the link he created, in this case I access the pool that is on his machine. I'm going to tag him here so he can see if he can help you. @lpsdamaceno

[06/26/2021 9:45 PM] marcioglaser#3380
Mining on the same machine, have you already obtained valid shares?


[06/26/2021 9:58 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
You should have an real ip that has direct access to the world, not an CGNAT ip. If you have this in your router, then you can port forward the outside to your machine that is running the server.


[06/26/2021 9:58 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
Currently my server is down but if anyone want to test something tell me so I can put it online :)


[06/26/2021 10:02 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
but both the node and the mining rig are in the same LAN why would I need a public ip for communicatign within the same home network? (Node,stratumserver,stratumserverproxy) are on PC1 that plugs on my router's lan port 1 and the mining rig is an other computer that plugs on my router's lan port 2


[06/26/2021 10:03 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
isnt there a way to configure the node and stratum server to run on a different ip other than 127.0.0.1?


[06/26/2021 10:03 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
lol


[06/26/2021 10:03 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
Now I get it


[06/26/2021 10:04 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
I think in windows you should only open the firewall ports and then connect it


[06/26/2021 10:04 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
I have done that


[06/26/2021 10:04 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
But in Linux you should deal with iptables


[06/26/2021 10:06 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
the rig runs hive OS and its localhost is 127.0.0.1 (cant change that) the node+stratum run on windows which also have local host as 127.0.0.1 I think when setting the miner to the rig to connect to localhost:3000 (or even type in 127.0.0.1:3000) hive OS tries to find that server "inside it self" if that makes a sense because there is a conflict since both machines have the same localhost ip


[06/26/2021 10:06 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
I believe that if I could configure the node and stratum to run on a different ip other than 127.0.0.1 the issue would be solved


[06/26/2021 10:06 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
any ideas ?


[06/26/2021 10:07 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
Yes that's it


[06/26/2021 10:07 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
You should run the miner inside hive os pointing to the IP of machine running the stratum server


[06/26/2021 10:07 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
192.168.x.x:3000

[06/26/2021 10:09 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
Don't forget the http:// if you're trying to connect to the stratum proxy.

If you're trying to connect directly to stratum server, then the port is 3032 or 3256 and instead http:// use stratum+tcp://


[06/26/2021 10:10 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838

[06/27/2021 5:59 PM] johntheripp3r#9591
I want to share my recent experience with mining with 1+ Gh/s with 3 different pools, herominers, nanopool and woolypooly
1. Herominers work on PROP payment so with me particularly I got 1.6 ERG less rewards if I had been on another pool, I chose herominers initially because it has great UI, easy to change your settings/payouts etc
2. Nanopool UI sucks really badly but PPLNS payment gets your more rewards, pain to change your rewards to something less as it relies on an argument called email which is not supported by NBminer which I use, in order to change the payout threshold you need an email parameter which is available through nanominer which also has more fees for mining ergo, 5%
3. Woolypooly has been the best so far with a nicer UI than nanopool and more payments (based on PPLNS)

In short:
Herominers: Nice UI, easy to use, ease of access, PROP (potentially lower payments), great payment frequency
Nanopool: Bad UI, easy to use, somewhat restricted access, PPLNS (higher payments), great payment frequency
Woolypooly: Nice UI, easy to use/setup, somewhat restricted access, PPLNS (higher payments), low payment frequency


[06/27/2021 6:08 PM] andee#4722
@johntheripp3r I don't like that people use nanopool, but there is no special argument for the email. nanopool uses the same template on all coins ADDR.RIGNAME/EMAIL


[06/27/2021 6:09 PM] johntheripp3r#9591
so you don't need a special email argument? I might be doing something wrong then


[06/27/2021 6:10 PM] andee#4722
I wrote how it works, you just add `/EMAIL`


[06/27/2021 6:11 PM] andee#4722
but please don't mine ergo at nanopool while they have so much of the nethash üôÇ


[06/27/2021 7:20 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
So I think I got it working now, the rig seems to mine (I see a hashrate instead of 0 )

but 1) I dont see any accepted shares (I really dont know how shares are set to work since its solo but I was getting shares soloing on herominers and also @marcioglaser seems to have shares in his print screen as well)


[06/27/2021 7:22 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
2) "Also that duplicate work detected trying to find a work around" message (in yellow on the print screen) concerns me


[06/27/2021 7:22 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
are there any issues or is that how it is supposed to be ?


[06/27/2021 7:24 PM] andee#4722
remove `solo:` from your address


[06/27/2021 7:24 PM] andee#4722
probably doesn't matter, but its not needed for solo mining on your own


[06/27/2021 7:25 PM] andee#4722
I don't know how the payments work, but you probably get them to the nodes reward address without any automatic payouts if not running a pool setup


[06/27/2021 7:26 PM] andee#4722
and if you get no shares its probably because diff = net diff and a share would equal block found


[06/27/2021 7:26 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
lol thanks for the heads up I totally forgot to edit that out (needed for herominers lol )


[06/27/2021 7:27 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
so I shouldnt be concerned that I dont see green accepted share messanges or this yellow saying duplicate work detected ?


[06/27/2021 7:29 PM] andee#4722
I don't know enough to say what is correct, but not seeing any shares indicates that you are not getting lower difficulty shares. I have seen duplicate work from pools too, but not very often

[06/27/2021 7:33 PM] marcioglaser#3380
Diff = 2 (if you mean 2 GH) would be too little for all your hashrate. You would be making hundreds of shares per minute. See what diff appears in your miner.


[06/27/2021 7:34 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838

that's bad I think because nonce is an important value for block verification like if that is messed up you may just mine nothing e.g in order to get a valid block your nonce must be all zeroes


[06/27/2021 8:37 PM] andee#4722
there was a new commit 12 minutes ago

but seems related to diff


[06/27/2021 8:37 PM] marcioglaser#3380
I believe they are still working on these adjustments. Some things still don't work as they should. For example the min diff I set was not supposed to be as low as 2GH but it went down to this value.


[06/27/2021 8:38 PM] marcioglaser#3380

At this point both, the issue is still the same, if I use a value for difficulty bigger than 3 digits I get the errors of low diff as in the previous print screen, If I use a value less than 3 digits (tried several 3 digit ones 2 digit ones and 1 digit one) I get hashrate as I should but only 1 job per table generation followed by "dublicate job detected. Attemping to work around. "  on every job (which is 1 per table generation which seems low on its own)

actually a little slower because it uses FTP I think to sync (even if that is not true bottom line is that it doesnt download the database using your max speed anyways )

not sure what this is about but you can check your .ergo subfolder size


[06/27/2021 10:10 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
if it increases in size given a few minutes from your last check

then it means you are good


[06/27/2021 10:10 PM] marcioglaser#3380
I don't have AMD, so I don't use TRM, but here on the internet I see images where it shows at the start of mining (start mining) the diff information in a yellow line. Why don't you open Shel boxed and restart miner?


[06/27/2021 10:11 PM] andee#4722
cpu speed matters when syncing, you should be able to see new height in the console output


[06/27/2021 10:11 PM] marcioglaser#3380
You need increase a minimum diff.


[06/27/2021 10:12 PM] andee#4722
@ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ you need to run with `--debug` to get anything usable


[06/27/2021 10:12 PM] andee#4722
logs should be in /var/log/miner/teamredminer


[06/27/2021 10:13 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
yea that is not an option I think with hive OS it starts mining via "miner start"  I will try to see if I can find the directory of trm and start it manually to check


[06/27/2021 10:13 PM] andee#4722
you add it to the flightsheet


[06/27/2021 10:13 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
lol


[06/27/2021 10:13 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
ok i try that


[06/27/2021 10:14 PM] andee#4722
when testing like this an alternative could be to add all but one gpu to the flightsheet that mines to a pool, then run 1 gpu manually for testing


[06/27/2021 10:22 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
I added the --debug flag to the flightsheet (lol I always wonder why I dont think of such simple stuff btw :P) but it doesnt seem to show anything more


[06/27/2021 10:23 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
if I go to the physical rig there is a tab that shows what is happening under the hood but I am not near the rig right now I will copy that tab tomorrow


[06/27/2021 11:11 PM] Nythain#6769
Just out of curiosity, how does this pool reward? Prop or pplns or is that configurable?


[06/27/2021 11:16 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
lol  I barely can manage making that think work on my lan for solo üòõ  dont know


[06/27/2021 11:17 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
I cant see any related setting though so I suppose if you want to like actually make a pool you have to use a seperate script for pool rewards based on the shares that the server logs or something


[06/27/2021 11:17 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
the only thing you can set in the stratum server is pool fee


[06/27/2021 11:18 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
as far as I know


[06/27/2021 11:18 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
actually wait a minute


[06/27/2021 11:19 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
yea on swagger (something like the config on the node)


[06/27/2021 11:19 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
you can configure a reward script


[06/27/2021 11:20 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838

do you know since when this pool exists ?


[06/27/2021 11:27 PM] Nythain#6769

[06/27/2021 11:27 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
I talked about that idea in a public discord a month ago hope that they existed before that and didnt steal my idea lol

[06/27/2021 11:32 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
its pretty cool doe I mean I would prefere to solo mine like that


[06/27/2021 11:34 PM] arokace#8057
That is pretty neat.  And I think wooly needs to copy their definition of their pool type lol.  Wouldn't be surprised if it was similar design, ie shares worth less in the beginning of the PPLNS window


[06/27/2021 11:48 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
What is hybrid solo? Like pool solo mode?


[06/27/2021 11:48 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
You can do that easily in miningcore.


[06/27/2021 11:54 PM] johntheripp3r#9591
I think your 3060 overclock is too high


[06/28/2021 12:01 AM] andee#4722
the problem is most likely the stratum server


[06/28/2021 12:16 AM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
@andee so  I took a look at https://github.com/todxx/teamredminer/blob/master/USAGE.txt   and found a flag that shows something more `--pool_debug`


[06/28/2021 12:16 AM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
which shows more stuff gonna dump it and upload it in a few minutes

that was my whole point lol


[06/28/2021 1:22 AM] andee#4722
it does not, but if you are going to operate a pool that instruction shouldn't have to be included. not being rude, just being honest


[06/28/2021 1:22 AM] ziggomatic#9335
what andee said.


[06/28/2021 1:22 AM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
nah I dissagree I mean you shouldnt be a programmer to just solomine with your rig

solo mining is fine, that's a chance to learn


[06/28/2021 1:23 AM] Nythain#6769
Dont need a pool to solo mine


[06/28/2021 1:23 AM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
but you need a stratum server


[06/28/2021 1:23 AM] Nythain#6769
True


[06/28/2021 1:25 AM] andee#4722
what server have people been using before this one?


[06/28/2021 1:25 AM] ziggomatic#9335
no idea. assuming their own


[06/28/2021 1:25 AM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
also by following that logic then why to mention `npm update` in the first place and not assume it as well I mean the only thing an experienced guy whould need is the link to clone


[06/28/2021 1:26 AM] ziggomatic#9335
i'm not gonna split the hairs further

[06/28/2021 1:54 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I think it is a good way to learn, just setting up a pool and going for it with some friends privately. That's how I'm learning. In some months time when I learn how to manage every aspect, and fix any issue that arise, then maybe I will take it public. the hardest part is working out how to add coins that are not supported by the various scripts for me. Installing a pool and adding a popular coin is easy.


[06/28/2021 2:03 AM] ziggomatic#9335
yeah i think you guys are doing a service honestly


[06/28/2021 2:03 AM] ziggomatic#9335
if you keep submitting feedback


[06/28/2021 2:06 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
It doesn't feel as scary as trying to learn how to setup PHP/MYSQL websites the first time I tried, about 20 years ago, so I feel confident. It all seems straight forwards. I'll feel better when I am confident I can back, fix issues and maintain without any confusion. I have two home servers to play with.


[06/28/2021 2:07 AM] marcioglaser#3380
I'm sure we can all help each other.

Around here I can mine 100% ok with NV_Miner, and today we took an important step by getting shares with NB Miner after StratumServer update.

I intend to start testing with friends soon, but only after being 100% ok with NB Miner


[06/28/2021 2:07 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I'm actually playing around with VTC pools right now. But ERG is next on my list. I think NOMP is the best option for both TBH.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[06/28/2021 2:08 AM] marcioglaser#3380
After that, thinking about making it public, then we'll need other friends studying about back end, front end, or someone who has mastered it around here and knows how to make a pool with good UI.


[06/28/2021 2:08 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Maybe Yiimp for VTC if I can work out how to install the coin on it.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[06/28/2021 2:09 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Yep. I mean it can be made public for testing, just with a big red message saying as much and fixed low payouts.


[06/28/2021 2:13 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
How much RAM do you guys get when renting a VPS for a pool?


[06/28/2021 2:14 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I guess it depends on the coins?


[06/28/2021 2:20 AM] ziggomatic#9335
no idea what the requirements are :p


[06/28/2021 2:21 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I think 4Gb should be fine for one coin. I realise some coins like VTC need the DAG/data file loaded into memory though I think.


[06/28/2021 2:21 AM] ziggomatic#9335
what provider is that from?


[06/28/2021 2:22 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I haven't looked at providers much yet, just practising with servers at home, but somewhere like Digital Ocean should be fine, and easy to clone pools to new locations.


[06/28/2021 2:23 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Will probably host the UI and a forum on a different server completely. So the front end doesn't die if one of the pools does.


[06/28/2021 2:25 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
My niche will be UK pool servers.


[06/28/2021 2:25 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
EU is fine, but I know myself and others would rather be a bit closer.


[06/28/2021 2:27 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
This was the first pool I started playing around with, just a simple p2pool for VTC http://acidpool.xyz:9171/ I don't really like mining on p2pool though, rewards never seem to match a busy centralised pool for me.


[06/28/2021 2:28 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Maybe bad luck, but I tested for a month and it seemed a little short.


[06/28/2021 2:54 AM] marcioglaser#3380
Congratulations, it's already well advanced.
This UI is cool.
Could you share her source?

Does it have other features like graphics?


[06/28/2021 3:03 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
The UI was passed to me by the owner of hashalot.net, it's an old project of his. Here is the web-static folder as he gave it to me, it needs a bit of tidying up.

A few of us have these pools up, testing different protocols etc.. it's also possible this will get completely re-written from scratch at some point, as it;s all pretty old and hacky.


[06/28/2021 3:06 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647

I'd also be interested to know more about p2pool and python3 dev if you know more? I can't seem to find much.  I would love to have the time to setup pool or UI in python3 with D3 for visuals... Hobby for now I supposed (like many others here it seems!)


[06/28/2021 8:11 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
The py3 port has only just started to be worked on, just a couple of people in another server working on it: https://github.com/chadouming/p2pool-vtc/commit/1c29200680f46e667f10f9e3056f404588ad57c3.patch will probably be a while before it is finished.

Did you guys have a problem with "rewardRecipients" in ErgoStratumServer or in ergo-nomp? 
I have Yoroi wallet. After I copy wallet address to "rewardRecipients" I get error: "invalid address length for MY_ADDRESS".
Can I use Yoroi in this case or maybe not?


[06/28/2021 1:35 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Every pool I've ever installed requires a legacy address.


[06/28/2021 1:35 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Not 100% this is the case with ERG as I didn't try it yet, but I'm pretty sure it will be the case.


[06/28/2021 1:47 PM] andee#4722
@kijekk ```not used:

"coin"
"address"
"rewardRecipients"
"p2p"```


[06/28/2021 1:57 PM] kijekk#6636
how public pool can work without "address" and "rewardRecipients"?


[06/28/2021 1:57 PM] andee#4722
it would need to be implemented by the operator


[06/28/2021 1:59 PM] andee#4722
and for anyone looking at 'ergo-nomp', I would compare the source to original nomp to see what changes has been made as the inital commit was by the repo owner with only a readme, then another user which now seems to be deleted from github was the one that actually committed all the files


[06/28/2021 2:00 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
That's pretty confusing.


[06/28/2021 2:01 PM] kijekk#6636

[06/28/2021 5:42 PM] andee#4722
if you look at the diff cmd like `diff -r -x .git -x refs node-open-mining-portal/libs/paymentProcessor.js ergo-nomp/libs/paymentProcessor.js` you see what order the files are in, so when it shows < its the content in the first file, and > shows whats on the same lines in the other file


[06/28/2021 5:44 PM] andee#4722
it seems like only a couple things has been commented out and the stratum dependency has been changed to one thats in the same repo as ergo-nomp


[06/28/2021 10:04 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I've got the node sync'd and starting the server, but I get this:
It appears to make a successful API call (and I have verified this with curl)

Can someone explain where im pulling the ip for this?


[06/29/2021 11:59 PM] Nythain#6769
Whatever ip your node is at. If this is running on the same machine 127.0.0.1 should work. If its a seperate machine on the same lan use the lan ip of the machine running the node, and if its hosted elsewhere, well im sure you get the point.


[06/30/2021 12:14 AM] Jerry_slush#5579
thanks


[07/01/2021 5:56 AM] Marty#4039
Does ergo-nomp run the stratum server or do you run that separate?


[07/01/2021 5:57 AM] Marty#4039
So if I'm understanding everything correctly, to run a mining pool with a website you can do this:

1) setup a node
2) run stratum server 
3) point nomp to them and init (after changing the website around since it's not complete really)


[07/01/2021 5:58 AM] Marty#4039
Does that mean you need three separate servers running to make it all work? And with redundancy that's 6 total?


[07/01/2021 6:00 AM] Marty#4039
Or is it more correct to say 

1) run an ergo node
2) run nomp pointing to the ergo node as the coin daemon

Requiring 2 servers (one for the node and one for the webserver) or 4 for redundancy


[07/01/2021 6:02 AM] Nythain#6769
Everything *could* run on same server but its popular to put webui on different server. Could keep node, server and proxy together since if one goes down all 3 are borked anyways. So id say 2, 4 or 5 with redundancy. Yes running a legit pool aint cheap or easy, thus the fees lol


[07/01/2021 6:04 AM] Nythain#6769
I dont have much experience with nomp as a whole though. Just breaking down the main elements. All of this im learning as i go.


[07/01/2021 6:06 AM] Marty#4039
What's the diff between server and proxy?


[07/01/2021 6:06 AM] Marty#4039
Or you just meant web server in that?

[07/01/2021 6:12 AM] Nythain#6769
Basically, and im intoxicated, you could consider the stratum server the core "pool" while the stratum proxy is the miner connection and work management element

Feel free to chime in anyone smarter/less drunk than me for correction or further elaboration


[07/01/2021 2:40 PM] zargarzadehmoein#2928
Hi,
I saw your log. In this log, I did not see a problem with the rejection of your shares.
I also need a log for further review, which includes the details of the job posted by the server and the submission (solution or share) sent by the minor.


[07/01/2021 2:56 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
The rejections happen when I set difficulty to a value greater than 3 digits long


[07/01/2021 2:56 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
if a value is lower than 3 digits i "just" never get a share and always get that "duplicate job trying to work around" allert


[07/01/2021 2:59 PM] ŒîŒ∂_ŒñŒøœÅŒºœÄŒ¨œÇ#9838
and I have tried a variety of 3 digit 2 digit 1 digit  dif settings but still no share and dublicate job alerts on each job (which is just 1 per table generation which I also find low like if I solo on hero miners I get dozens of jobs in between table generations with the same gear)


[07/01/2021 3:08 PM] marcioglaser#3380
Look at this code above. These are what I sent you with the errors as you requested.


[07/01/2021 3:28 PM] zargarzadehmoein#2928
We checked these, It needs further investigation. We should test with other miners. If it is possible for you, please test with other miners as well.
The nonce size problem occurs when the miner checks the interval of the specified between extranonce1 and size of extra nonce2 and does not reach an output, and also does not receive a new job from the server. In this case, the miner continues on the previous job and rejects the interval of the extranonce1.

Anyone have thoughts on chosing between wooly, hero and now leaf pool? Is there an advantage to hopping over to leaf to help for a bit?


[07/02/2021 10:34 PM] Leif Erickson#8939

Does leaf say what there pool fee will be? I know right now it is 0 but that's temporary


[07/03/2021 2:26 PM] andee#4722
I have not seen anything about it but my guess is <= 0.9%


[07/03/2021 2:28 PM] andee#4722
since they go for 60 blocks confirmation as soon as they have enough ERG and a 0.1 payout threshold I think they might actually cut the fee a little to attract miners

[07/04/2021 11:53 PM] Nythain#6769
bah, just had to start over from scratch on the node due to a power saving bug... and that's why you don't try to do anything serious on bleeding edge software


[07/05/2021 4:10 PM] Marty#4039
Power saving bug on your host machine? I'm learning to use k8s to setup a VM cluster now. Next step will be to fire up the node, stratum, proxy, and http


[07/05/2021 5:15 PM] Nythain#6769
You gonna host all elements together or split server and http?


[07/05/2021 5:20 PM] Nythain#6769
not so much my end game host machine, this is more my "learning how to do this" machine which is my daily driver and currently runs win11 (thus the bug)


[07/05/2021 5:35 PM] Marty#4039
I was thinking run everything on separate VMs or docker containers. I might try a raspberry Pi cluster in the future. 

Have you thought to dual boot Linux on your test machine?


[07/05/2021 5:36 PM] Marty#4039
Someone quoted mr Miyagi to me earlier though and said don't jump right into k8s or server clusters or all that. Just see if I can get the pool running first

How much experience do you have with this stuff? I'm catching up. I used to write jquery and PHP for a living but that's all useless now


[07/05/2021 6:08 PM] Nythain#6769
pools in general, none. though i am the hardware/networking/hosting/server kind of guy


[07/06/2021 7:30 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
@Marty I setup a docker compose file for node, stratum, proxy and you can scale with not too much more effort...I don't have a specific goal, just done similar work and enjoy the automation.  I can mine, but I still use wooly


[07/06/2021 1:33 PM] Marty#4039
I looked at the official docker node. I was curious how it handles wallet generation for the node in that case. And things like rest API security. 

Are you sharing your work? Are you interested in starting a pool? I'm a lot better at the UI/UX front end stuff. Was learning the backend so I can launch my own pool


[07/06/2021 1:40 PM] andee#4722
I don't see how it would be any different from running the jar directly


[07/06/2021 1:41 PM] andee#4722
I'm running the node in a container just for testing purposes, but using podman instead of docker


[07/06/2021 6:02 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I can try to get something up...I'm better at backend than UI :). It's basically what you are saying, tho, andee...my goal was to isolate and create some dependencies in the docker compose config for scaling or adding reverse proxy and such more easily


[07/06/2021 6:09 PM] andee#4722
containers are really great. I am going to start playing with a pool myself but I have a hard time focusing on it right now with the heat üòì


[07/06/2021 6:16 PM] Nythain#6769
So @Leif Erickson is good at backend, @Marty is good at front end and ux/ui. I smell new pool colaboration.


[07/06/2021 7:22 PM] Marty#4039
So the docker gets it to the web Gui stage and then you set it up from there manually still?


[07/06/2021 7:44 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I was going to take a front end and make another docker for it...I'll have time at end of the month for a bigger effort, and when I get back home I'll try to get what I have up somewhere.  Might be good to use existing project since I basically just git clone node, stratum and proxy in to own folders currently (and miner in another sir, but just for testing).  Having a gui dir was my next step, and then just tweaks to get everything running smoothly


[07/06/2021 7:48 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
Yes, basically. The gui would talk to the proxy and I expect the gui would be behind nginx/gunicorn or some such.  Configured properly the backend should be able to scale and could setup multiple guis if needed, then a redundant db or redis or whatever is tracking state for the gui.


[07/06/2021 7:49 PM] Marty#4039
I mean the Gui you get when you setup a node


[07/06/2021 7:49 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
Using containers in this way is also nice for dev since you can setup dev config for single system but prod config for cloud or whatever


[07/06/2021 7:49 PM] Marty#4039
Because after setting up a node, there was still config and wallet generation, and some API interactions to get it going. How much of this is done in the docker file ahead of time?


[07/06/2021 7:50 PM] Marty#4039
Yes and perfect for mirrors and k8s system


[07/06/2021 7:50 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
The docker file just makes the gui available...still have to setup the wallet


[07/06/2021 7:51 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I put the configs in a central location and mounted volumes to make it easier to work with in dev


[07/06/2021 7:51 PM] Marty#4039
Copy that. So once you've setup a wallet and all the config, can you build a container that can fully boot up to a running state with your wallet and everything configured?


[07/06/2021 7:52 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
Yes, I run "docker compose up" and after about 30 seconds I can connect my miner


[07/06/2021 7:53 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
Still need to restart the proxy once after stratum is up...need a better way to try again, just need a little time.


[07/06/2021 7:54 PM] Marty#4039
Can I help at all? Maybe we can collaborate on this. 

NOMP has a webpage that launches on top of the other parts. Maybe I can point my nomp server to your stratum and proxy, see if we can get them talking


[07/06/2021 7:55 PM] Marty#4039
I could modify that UI to make it suitable


[07/06/2021 7:55 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
Yeah, that was my plan I just haven't had the time, so some help would be great!  I'll try to get something up before I head out for a few days


[07/06/2021 7:56 PM] Marty#4039
Sure, sounds good. I can also fire up the containers and maybe try to do whatever bits you can't get to in time


[07/06/2021 7:56 PM] Marty#4039
If you give me a few instructions on the missing pieces. I am still educating myself


[07/06/2021 7:56 PM] Marty#4039
I have a server running at home. 

Tulipfarm.one


[07/06/2021 7:57 PM] Marty#4039
SSH setup as well so far, on Ubuntu


[07/06/2021 7:57 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
Sounds good.  Perfect, docker too?


[07/06/2021 7:58 PM] Marty#4039
Yes docked is installed


[07/06/2021 7:58 PM] Marty#4039
Docker*


[07/06/2021 7:58 PM] Marty#4039
Anything else can be added


[07/06/2021 7:59 PM] Marty#4039
It's dynamic DNS


[07/06/2021 7:59 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
Hmm, I may have a few mins to get you the main parts and a.couple.one liners to get going what I have.  I'll dm my email here in a few


[07/06/2021 7:59 PM] Marty#4039
Sounds great


[07/06/2021 8:03 PM] andee#4722
@Marty you still connect to the node as normal, but you isolate the java and node installation to a container. wallet can be shared between multiple nodes by just mounting it


[07/06/2021 8:04 PM] Marty#4039
If you did redundancy with something like k8s, can all that be automated?


[07/06/2021 8:05 PM] andee#4722
everything can be automated üôÇ I have never used kubernetes though

Not able to access swagger ui from public (not using local host)


[07/06/2021 9:10 PM] andee#4722
why do you even want it accessible from the outside? if you open the port on your router it will be, but why?


[07/06/2021 9:11 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
because its a remote server so I can't do local ip


[07/06/2021 9:12 PM] andee#4722
then you use vpn or ssh tunnel


[07/06/2021 9:13 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
guides ask you to point to http://127.0.0.1 but you can't do that from remote location thus using public, i see tons of logs but not sure if you should be able to access swagger from outside (as long as security permits)


[07/06/2021 9:13 PM] andee#4722
or just use the api directly via ssh


[07/06/2021 9:14 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
are you telling me you can't access the node ui using the public IP, makes no sense


[07/06/2021 9:14 PM] andee#4722
its possible if you expose the port, but exposing the port makes no sense..


[07/06/2021 9:15 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
as long as you have whitelist no problem


[07/06/2021 9:17 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
forgot the custom port NOT 80

going back to the error code - is this normal behavior? How can we check the node status?


[07/06/2021 9:20 PM] andee#4722
have you created a wallet?


[07/06/2021 9:21 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
not yet, i'll try to finish up so could access node ui


[07/06/2021 9:22 PM] andee#4722
it clearly says ```Failed to read wallet. Manual initialization is required. Details: 
java.lang.Exception: Cannot readSecretStorage: dir '/home/ubuntu/ergo/.ergo/.ergo/wallet/keystore' doesn't exist```


[07/06/2021 9:27 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
it does exist, getting this error either I do manual pointer or user their filter ${ergo.directory}"/.ergo". Manual was used in one of their guides but on win box so maybe $" is preferred in linux?!

there is no need to specify those directories


[07/06/2021 9:40 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
got to be windows thingy then


[07/06/2021 9:40 PM] andee#4722
and it was not complaining about wallet dir, it was wallet/keystore


[07/06/2021 9:41 PM] andee#4722
and keystore does not exist if you haven't initialized a wallet


[07/06/2021 9:44 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
that one correct, there was another one for main directory, i'll try to finish up the rest and see how it goes....


[07/06/2021 9:51 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
@andee is the default username changed when installing a node? it shouldn't right?


[07/06/2021 9:54 PM] Pgr456#1839
@en4ble | bmoblockchain.us username is not changed when installing a node.
How do you start your node?
And i am seeing that you are logged in as root user on your system but you are trying to use the home directory of the ubuntu user. Does the user ubuntu exist?


[07/06/2021 10:02 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
thank you @Pgr456 just wanted to confirmed, starting a node from ssh(cli), user did exist yes


[07/06/2021 10:03 PM] Pgr456#1839
I meant with starting which command and arguments you use? üôÇ


[07/06/2021 10:04 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
according to the guide>  java -jar ergo-<myRelease>.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf


[07/06/2021 10:04 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
i think my priv key got corrupted thus the issue with username - different issue disregard that one


[07/06/2021 10:08 PM] andee#4722
run the node as the unprivileged user and don't mess with the files as root


[07/07/2021 1:31 AM] Marty#4039
@andee is giving excellent security advice, saving you from yourself


[07/07/2021 1:31 AM] Marty#4039
May I ask though.. if you are running a stratum server, does the node not need to be accessible from the internet? Or do you allow the stratum server to ssh with port tunneling?


[07/07/2021 1:32 AM] Marty#4039
Or do blocks get submitted in another way I'm not familiar with yet


[07/07/2021 2:14 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
you allow specific port for mining


[07/07/2021 9:44 AM] kijekk#6636
@Leif Erickson @Marty I can help you if you want with my sysops/devops experience. If you need a public server, I can prepare it.


[07/07/2021 12:26 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Got some new parts today, just need to swap in an SSD from another machine and I will have a spare box to play about on. Today's mission is setting up a miningcore instance on win server 2019.

@Erazor are you up and running with a pool on testnet?


[07/07/2021 1:03 PM] Erazor#9864
@andee Kind of


[07/07/2021 1:34 PM] Marty#4039
Thanks! Will let you know. Node is up and running, will be testing nomp going into the weekend


[07/07/2021 1:53 PM] kijekk#6636
Ok. If you have a problem, you can text me. Maybe I went through it earlier.


[07/07/2021 1:57 PM] Marty#4039
Awesome, thanks. I'll DM you


[07/07/2021 1:57 PM] Marty#4039
Did you use nomp or something else for the UI


[07/07/2021 2:01 PM] kijekk#6636
I deployed ergo-nomp and the UI is fine, but I have a problem with connection from rig to stratum server


[07/07/2021 2:12 PM] Marty#4039
I wonder if I can just take the UI elements from nomp and run the ergo stratum and proxy servers


[07/07/2021 2:12 PM] Marty#4039
Going to look into it further coming up to the weekend


[07/07/2021 2:16 PM] kijekk#6636
Is proxy server still needed? Can't miners connect directly to stratum server?


[07/07/2021 4:31 PM] Nythain#6769
i believe proxy is still required


[07/07/2021 4:32 PM] Nythain#6769
would probably depend on each miner software though, if it supports stratum or http only


[07/07/2021 4:34 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
guys what are the recommended specs for the node? Assuming its RAM?

I would say minimum 4GB, 3 for node itself. that might grow in the future


[07/07/2021 5:20 PM] kijekk#6636
you need to limit memory for java during start
eg:
java -Xms1024m -Xmx2048m -jar ergo-4.0.12.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf


[07/07/2021 5:29 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
@kijekk otherwise what? will eat everything?


[07/07/2021 5:31 PM] Marty#4039
I ran into the same error en4ble


[07/07/2021 5:32 PM] Marty#4039
It was a remote server with 4gb memory


[07/07/2021 5:36 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
I've noticed it seems like more memory intensive vs cpu. Did you use the limiter or uped the memory?


[07/07/2021 5:36 PM] Nythain#6769
well shit, i should look into this when i get home and see how much my node is using atm lol


[07/07/2021 5:37 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
kk let us know üôè


[07/07/2021 5:42 PM] kijekk#6636
Probably yes. My server has 4GB, but only 2,10 in use with this limits and working a few weeks without problems.


[07/07/2021 5:43 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
@kijekk are you running any script in case of server reboot?


[07/07/2021 5:44 PM] kijekk#6636
Actually no. Its running just on screen


[07/07/2021 5:44 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
i guess it never bounce for you yet üôÇ


[07/07/2021 5:46 PM] kijekk#6636
Maybe but didnt crash due to low memory


[07/07/2021 5:51 PM] Marty#4039
I'll check at lunch too. I have a node running in docker right now

{Reactions}
üôè 

[07/07/2021 5:52 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
Are you running a limiter or no?


[07/07/2021 5:54 PM] Marty#4039
Not sure, I didn't configure it


[07/07/2021 5:55 PM] Marty#4039
Someone else setup the docker. I'll try to determine that


[07/07/2021 5:59 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Feel like I actually accomplished something finally. Not quite an ERG pool, but managed to setup a working VTC pool, on windows server 2019.

[07/07/2021 6:03 PM] Nythain#6769
Well, you figured that much out, should make understanding ergo pool easier


[07/07/2021 6:03 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Yeah, I had to just get any pool working to fully understand. It makes a LOT more sense to me now.


[07/07/2021 6:03 PM] Nythain#6769
i'm lagging behind hardcore. between work and toddler i haven't turned on my computer monitor in 3 days


[07/07/2021 6:04 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I've been so slack, but today I received the parts I need to make this server, and just went at it. TBH I could do with a beer right now, I have had some hair pulling moments in the last 6 hours.


[07/07/2021 6:05 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
But it works. Can only be upwards from here.


[07/07/2021 6:06 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
If one of the big mining scripts add native ergo support, it will make life very easy. This was my whole issue setting up the VTC pool, it's taken me months of trying.. could setup a LTC pool in an hour etc.. but as soon as miningcore added support I found it easy.


[07/07/2021 6:11 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
for me is to understand of the architecture and and requirements which is not well documented imho, congrats btw


[07/07/2021 6:12 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Yeah it is very confusing at first.


[07/07/2021 6:52 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
No limiter, just running in container.


[07/07/2021 6:56 PM] bigpey#5086
Can anyone here show me where to start? I have a lot of experience running servers.


[07/07/2021 7:01 PM] bigpey#5086
Do you get a ergo node setup and then use the stratum servers?


[07/07/2021 7:12 PM] Nythain#6769
that would be the popular (possibly only) way to do it atm. still not confirmed if the stratum proxy is required with current miners?


[07/07/2021 7:16 PM] andee#4722
ergo node + stratum server is the first step. then comes the choice of modifying an existing pool setup or DIY


[07/07/2021 9:33 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I hope miningcore add it eventually to the list of default coins.


[07/07/2021 9:38 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
what you mean?


[07/07/2021 9:39 PM] Nythain#6769
it's another pool software, that doesn't have ergo as a supported coin by default


[07/07/2021 9:39 PM] Nythain#6769
actually pretty limited in coins it supports oob


[07/07/2021 9:41 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Yeah, it will just be easier when the big pool apps add it. Then it will be easy to setup.


[07/07/2021 9:42 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Win server vtc pool project went well, just trying to get a block now to confirm it's working, fingers crossed.

[07/07/2021 9:45 PM] Nythain#6769
so miningcore is what you got vert up and running with? also, is that UI just an admin dashboard or are you running a separate frontend for the pool? (i know this isn't ergo related but it's pool related, the more we learn right)


[07/07/2021 10:12 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
It is yes, they added support for it recently, before that it was a case of DIY and nobody was really sure how, and those that did know didn't want to share. The UI is a pool front end UI made by somebody else, you can see it here, but beware connection info and other stuff is wrong. http://ui.asciidity.xyz/ I'll buy a new domain and tidy it up shortly.


[07/07/2021 10:13 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
The front end is just hosted on a standard LAMP server and gets info from the API


[07/07/2021 10:17 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I think miningcore is solid though, you can just start more instances of it with different coin config, for pplns, or solo.. it wouldn't be too hard for me to just add other coins, especially since they updated the readme from ubuntu 16 times to modern day. Pretty much all of these projects have outdated info a lot of the time.


[07/07/2021 10:18 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I would like ERG, ETC, VTC, RVN, XMR.


[07/07/2021 10:20 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I ran into some windows specific issues.. it tells you to use windows path format if using windows, makes sense, but then doesn't like it when you do. I had to use the root directory for log files and verthash.dat due to this.


[07/07/2021 10:20 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
TBH I didn't expect to get it working today at all.


[07/07/2021 10:23 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
MPOS also interests me as I know some PHP.. but it seems it has been left for dead dev wise. NOMP is also another option but I don't like PPS


[07/07/2021 10:23 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Yiimp is also another option.


[07/07/2021 10:24 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
But honestly I think the best way is to just try and build any pool, whatever one suits your setup, I learned more today than I did in a few months of reading about it. I feel more confident now that I can try other software, I know what it looks like when it;s working etc..


[07/07/2021 10:26 PM] kijekk#6636
Setup Yiimp, MPOS or NOMP is not a problem. The problem is adding a new coin to them.


[07/07/2021 10:26 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Yep.


[07/07/2021 10:27 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
It's easy if they are clones of bitcoin or litecoin etc..


[07/07/2021 10:27 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
But otherwise, not so easy.


[07/07/2021 10:28 PM] kijekk#6636
exactly, all coins based on sha256 are easy


[07/07/2021 10:28 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Yeah, when you have to add in strange algos, with strange .dat files etc.. I spent months trying to figure it out for VTC.. I failed.


[07/07/2021 10:29 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
XMR is pretty simple.


[07/07/2021 10:29 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I actually like the idea of an XMR pool, no real profit, i just like the idea of all those CPUs.


[07/07/2021 10:30 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I don;t have any CPUs good enough, with my electric cost they all run XMR in minus figures.


[07/07/2021 10:31 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
We will look back and laugh at this in ten years.


[07/07/2021 10:31 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647

[07/07/2021 10:42 PM] kijekk#6636

[07/07/2021 11:41 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I'm confident at installing things, maintaining them, and keeping them up for many days. Occasionally I will get obsessed with something and zone out, maybe make a chat script or some PHP forums mods from scratch, but the actual dev of a lot of this stuff is above my head.


[07/07/2021 11:41 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368

High entry barrier is good


[07/07/2021 11:41 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
That;s why I like the idea of an XMR pool so much tBH


[07/07/2021 11:42 PM] Marty#4039

[07/07/2021 11:48 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
why cant you get a approved high level design and blueprint?!


[07/07/2021 11:50 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Well, I noticed it's not too bad here. You're right though, a lot of people don't want to help, it's probably because of the money involved. I know what you mean though, there were people who "could" have told me how to load verthash in miningcore months ago. I can't really moan though as those same people did help me setup p2pool, and gave me a nice UI, and slowly introduced me to things. I can understand why people won;t just give out ELI5 tutorials in some cases.


[07/07/2021 11:51 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368

[07/07/2021 11:51 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I remember building websites back in the day and we would have wars seeing how could add the best new feature the fastest.. and no way would we share directly without payment.


[07/07/2021 11:51 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Haha yeah


[07/07/2021 11:51 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647

well thanks to my unlimited aws resource I can make many mistakes before I get working one!


[07/07/2021 11:53 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Nice. The pool I showed is hosted on a real basic machine, fast connection. I don't think I can gather enough miners to stress it TBH.


[07/07/2021 11:54 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Had similar machines handle busy game servers no issue.


[07/07/2021 11:58 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
That;s the idea here TBH, I'm just mining to the pool we setup with a friend, we have enough between us to a get a block on average every few days. Once we can confirm it;s fully working, I'll move forward and start improving the UI and doing other things for it. Look into adding other coins and server locations later.


[07/07/2021 11:59 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Need to do a few backups/restores, rebuild coin wallets etc.. don't want to get stuck in production.


[07/08/2021 12:00 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
redundancy and restore is a key!


[07/08/2021 12:00 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
same goes with load balancing and scalling


[07/08/2021 12:01 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368

[07/08/2021 12:01 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Yep, all things high in my mind.


[07/08/2021 12:02 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I enjoy building forums so that will serve as support. I'll also link to specific coin discords if I actually use them myself. And yeah, then the "fun" stuff haha.. hopefully nobody hates me too much.


[07/08/2021 12:03 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I enjoy using discord but don't like managing one.


[07/08/2021 12:04 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I can also limit risk at first by forcing low payouts. worse comes to worse I can fix it without breaking the bank or losing miners.


[07/08/2021 12:04 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
All these scripts allow for as many daemons as you like as well, so you can have ten backups if you really wanted.


[07/08/2021 12:05 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
You just use a different data dir


[07/08/2021 12:06 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
The security of NOMP looks very good.


[07/08/2021 12:06 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I feel everything else needs a lot extra on the server.


[07/08/2021 12:06 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I think these things only really start becoming an issue when you are busy though or have some haters.


[07/08/2021 12:08 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Load balancing is something I need to learn about, my solution would be cloning the pool to extra servers. Never really looked into other solutions as I normally just rent managed server space.


[07/08/2021 12:10 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
How do people treat the nodes they have for coin pools? Will they leave them nice and open to act as a node, or limit connections etc.. to save resources??


[07/08/2021 12:13 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
two different load balancing, internal so you can scale out and geo so you don't have to use pointers like us-west/us-east.


[07/08/2021 12:13 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Ah.. Yeah I see. So a geoloaction script that sends to the right place based on ping?


[07/08/2021 12:13 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
based on latency yes...


[07/08/2021 12:15 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
We tried improving the VTC p2pool network like this by making a list ordered by ping, in reality the best solution would be for everybody to run their own, but the next best thing was the closest nodes. I kinda lost hope though as there are 1 or 2 for profit nodes that have hundreds of users and don't care about latency.


[07/08/2021 12:15 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
They cause up to 20% rejects in the network


[07/08/2021 12:16 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Hence my move to a centralised pool


[07/08/2021 12:16 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
The other miner mining with me are in the same country.


[07/08/2021 12:18 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
The idea of p2pool is amazing, but it translates to less coins IME


[07/08/2021 12:19 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
People say it's not true but I'm sure we are punished for others bad setups. I agree in the stats my p2pool looks great compared to the rest, but I know from experience of myself and friends it generates us about 10% less coin.


[07/08/2021 12:20 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
People argue luck, but most of us have decent hashrate and gave it a long shot. the lower earnings were obvious from the start but we gave it a chance.


[07/08/2021 12:21 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
If we are honest there is no way it can be as efficient, as much as it would be cool if it actually was.


[07/08/2021 12:22 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
It's like comparing a torrent to a direct http link.


[07/08/2021 12:22 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Like it's own little side chain of slightly slower shares.


[07/08/2021 12:26 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
The way it takes the fee is crazy as well, it takes it in the form of a random share.. so if you take it from somebody with a real low hashrate, their day will look so bad, and you will get hardly anything, but if the share comes from somebody with a large hashrate they might not even notice, but the pool will get lots more. I don;t think anybody can honestly look at the source and explain how it works to a 5 year old. TL;DR it's inconsistent and can really punish small miners.

[07/08/2021 2:17 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
Guys what do you think, should the coin daemon be separate server from NOMP(stratum) and node.js or can everything be on one server? Thoughts?

[07/08/2021 2:37 AM] Nythain#6769
i'd personally keep the coin daemon (ergo node) and stratum on the same server for ease, but on a different server than the ui/frontend


[07/08/2021 2:39 AM] Nythain#6769
but, if using nomp, not sure how easy it would be to split it up amongst different servers (assuming part of the reason using nomp is the incorporated front end and payment rewards system)


[07/08/2021 3:25 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
If you go with stratum only what you do with or how do you tackle payment system?!


[07/08/2021 3:30 AM] Nythain#6769
well, that's where the tricky part lies and pretty sure people turn to pre-created portal solutions like nomp and yiimp. i lack the dev capabilities to implement something homegrown.


[07/08/2021 3:33 AM] Nythain#6769
so i have a question, if using nomp does one need the official ergo stratum server too? the readme implies nomp contains a stratum server "It contains a stratum poolserver; reward/payment/share processor; and a (not yet completed) responsive user-friendly front-end website featuring mining instructions, in-depth live statistics, and an admin center." but i cant find anything that resembles ergostratumserver within the source for ergo-nomp


[07/08/2021 3:51 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
Would love the answer for that as well


[07/08/2021 4:04 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
It can all be on one server for sure, unless it's getting loads of traffic, or if the machines are very low spec.


[07/08/2021 4:11 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
surely better to have things on the same server unless there is a need not to.


[07/08/2021 4:13 AM] Nythain#6769
well, having web front end on separate server has advantage that miners can still wtf is going on if pool server goes down


[07/08/2021 4:14 AM] Nythain#6769
also, i mean, if one is looking to go production level you'll probably want different servers hosted across teh globe but probably really only need one web interface


[07/08/2021 4:37 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
Yeah i don't think front end needs to be on the same server/network if you only point information to stratum. You can always do GET from front for anything pool related. One front end website, multiple stratum servers


[07/08/2021 4:40 AM] Nythain#6769
That would be my approach.

16 was a no go, we found that out last night


[07/08/2021 12:50 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Yeah that's true, I do that myself but I think having all the parts that speak to each other on the same server is a good idea, unless the site is so busy that the load needs balancing, otherwise you will surely lose latency.


[07/08/2021 12:54 PM] Nythain#6769
Yeah, cant see any reason to split anything else up.


[07/08/2021 1:00 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I think it makes sense in some very busy situations but I honestly can't imagine how much traffic you would need to start stressing modern hardware like that. I always surprise myself just how far you can push some hardware, especially for game servers and such, as long as the connection is solid.


[07/08/2021 1:02 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe there is something I'm missing and it is better to have coind on one machine, pool on another etc.. in the same network, but I'd like to know the reason for a site with low traffic/use. I think maybe it is just "doing it right the first time" preparing for it getting very busy from the very start.


[07/08/2021 1:03 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I was thinking backup daemons but they are no good on separate servers if one with the pool goes down, I think it's more intended for putting them on the same machine in case one needs resyncying etc.. nothing should be just crashing or similar.

I'm not sure what they are using TBH. But a lot of these designs look very similar. I don't see any tell tell signs of it being miningcore but I'm not 100% sure.


[07/08/2021 7:33 PM] Nythain#6769
i guess... just awfully similar with some simple css edits


[07/08/2021 7:33 PM] Nythain#6769
shrink a few tables and reposition them, add a few elements, change some wording and icons and viola


[07/08/2021 7:34 PM] Nythain#6769
but, since pool operators keep their operations more secret than nsa documents the world will never know i guess


[07/08/2021 7:34 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I'm not sure, I mean mining core doesn't actually come with any UI, so most people just use whatever they can find online or make their own. This one is one I found on github but edited a bit.


[07/08/2021 7:35 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
It will be nice when ERG is supported by default. It's pretty easy to set this up as a multipool


[07/08/2021 7:36 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647

Strange, it works on netcat but not nbminer


[07/09/2021 1:33 PM] Marty#4039
@andee @kijekk thanks for checking


[07/09/2021 1:39 PM] kijekk#6636
maybe nbminer needs stratum-proxy?


[07/09/2021 1:40 PM] mrknc#4908
hey, guys, we put up a pool on testnet:

Mining Pool
Transparent, stable and efficient mining pool with fast payouts and 24/7 support.


[07/09/2021 1:43 PM] Marty#4039
Good point. I'll look into that


[07/09/2021 1:44 PM] Marty#4039
Nice work mrknc. Did you get a block with only 300Mh or is the stats displaying wrong?


[07/09/2021 1:54 PM] Nythain#6769
Thats the network hashrate and block find. Testnet not mainnet


[07/09/2021 1:56 PM] Marty#4039
Oh cool


[07/09/2021 2:00 PM] Nythain#6769
Heck of a job. If its still up tonight ill point my little 1050ti at it and further check it out :)


[07/09/2021 2:02 PM] mrknc#4908
@Nythain it will be up and down as we make some changes, but mostly it will be up as long as testnet is working


[07/09/2021 2:03 PM] Nythain#6769
Awesome. Cant wait to check it out. New pools more than welcome


[07/09/2021 2:12 PM] kijekk#6636
Good job @mrknc . Did you use any stratum-server from github or develop it yourself?


[07/09/2021 2:17 PM] mrknc#4908
We have adapted our own pool software to it. I wasn't the one implementing stratum, but if i recall correctly github stuff had to be adjusted to work with availble gpu miners


[07/09/2021 2:19 PM] mrknc#4908
sadly, what they call "stratum" is loosely related assortment of similar approaches of pool-miner communications, there is no consistency between coins/protocols

[07/09/2021 4:04 PM] Pgr456#1839
@en4ble | bmoblockchain.us VIRT 8450M and RES 3924 fully synced running in docker


[07/09/2021 4:04 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
pardon my ignorance, what is VIRT and RES?


[07/09/2021 4:05 PM] Pgr456#1839
RES is physical RAM and VIRT is virtual memory usage. It includes everything, including memory mapped files.


[07/09/2021 4:13 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
would you still recommend to put a limiter on that java?


[07/09/2021 4:28 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
also, is there any kind of recycling for the logs on the Ergo node or it just keeps growing?


[07/09/2021 4:35 PM] Pgr456#1839
When you run the jar you can add -Xmx 3G to the java command that should limit it. It is set to 3G in the Docker container as well so it should be fine with that


[07/09/2021 5:14 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
Thanks, and how do you deal with growing ergo.log?


[07/09/2021 5:16 PM] Pgr456#1839
Which log do you mean?


[07/09/2021 5:19 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
ergo.log - node captures all transactions and its growing fast


[07/09/2021 5:20 PM] Pgr456#1839
In which directory is it?


[07/09/2021 5:20 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
node directory where you store your ergo.conf


[07/09/2021 5:20 PM] Pgr456#1839
Seems like i don't have to handle it because it doesn't exist üòÑ


[07/09/2021 5:21 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
well anybody knows how to disable it?


[07/09/2021 5:26 PM] Pgr456#1839
Have you by accident enabled log lvl debug? According to this config in the github repo the file should only exist when debugging is enabled and it should grow max to 1 GB

@kijekk did you run jar or .sh?


[07/09/2021 8:12 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
i think problem is with .jar


[07/09/2021 8:12 PM] kijekk#6636
jar


[07/09/2021 8:13 PM] kijekk#6636
and about your Unexpected shutdown - I had similar situation earlier.


[07/09/2021 8:14 PM] kijekk#6636
the problem was firewall


[07/09/2021 8:14 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
so how the heck its working different for you? For me its just one file that keeps increasing, both using .jar

[07/09/2021 8:19 PM] kijekk#6636
seriously I have no idea, all I do is:

java -Xms1024m -Xmx2048m -jar ergo-4.0.12.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf
```


[07/09/2021 8:23 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
and the same version LOLOL, the only diff is the xms thats all


[07/09/2021 8:24 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
wonder where the retention policy is, i'll try with the .sh since its seems like you can do more


[07/09/2021 8:37 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
@glasgowm @sakata  can you guys look into this? We are running same .jar but my log is going above 1gb. Please advise


[07/09/2021 8:46 PM] andee#4722
I would think you actually need to run it until there is a next day, from what I see in that code there is no cap on the log file itself but on the total of the rotated logs


[07/09/2021 8:49 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
i'm fine with bigger size but I don't want this to be unlimited, it doesn't seems changable if you run .jar


[07/09/2021 8:49 PM] andee#4722
initial sync spews a lot of stuff, so inital log will be big before actual rotation starts


[07/09/2021 8:49 PM] andee#4722
@en4ble | bmoblockchain.us what other way is there to run the node?


[07/09/2021 8:50 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
Using start script from sbt-native-packager? per gh kb..


[07/09/2021 8:51 PM] andee#4722
not that I have used it, but I seriously doubt that it runs anything else


[07/09/2021 8:51 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
but if you saying all at the end is using .jar then dunno, maybe it is that initial sync, lets wait and see


[07/09/2021 8:52 PM] andee#4722

got the error during the make process, (  CC Makefile.dep not found)  running make test now


[07/09/2021 10:42 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
The REST API stuff was confusing me a bit before, I only really know PHP and all the examples I've seen have been in pure JS. Met another Windows Server and PHP guy who is building a pool earlier, and he showed me the code translated to PHP. It's amazingly simple to grab the variables. For more complicated lists and tables and such, you can just append some HTML to the end of the output etc..


[07/09/2021 10:43 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
My plan is to finally get everything integrated with a forum/community script, all skinned etc.. have the info on a portal with blocks and somewhere to enter wallet that leads them to dashboard.


[07/09/2021 10:43 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Make it dynamic so it grabs any coin pools in the API.


[07/09/2021 10:43 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Have a folder with coin logos and like BTC.png, LTC.png


[07/09/2021 10:47 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I've actually saw a pool somewhere, it was doing just what I want with Invision Power Board, the issue is I was mining some random coins and forgot the name.

I have one tip for you guys.. setup the pool on testnet first. It dawned on me at about 150% block effort, with people already mining, that I'm an idiot and should of done this first.


[07/09/2021 10:51 PM] andee#4722
I don't think that's a properly formatted error

because moving bins to a folder in path is the normal way of 'installing'

Don't set min diff too low. It's better to have a low hashrate miner ramp down after 90 second than a big miner to spam loads of low diff shares and get rejects. Aim it for a 20xx card.


[07/10/2021 12:50 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Or do you think it is a good idea to have a few ports with different starting diff? Or maybe even some with static diff? 

If yes, why??


[07/10/2021 12:55 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Also I retract what I said about hosting stuff on different servers. I think it is now worth separating everything if you have the hardware or cash to rent it all. Extra hops, security.


[07/10/2021 1:02 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647

I notice we might need some way of splitting logs into days. After a few months they will grow stupidly big. Or just delete them on a regular basis. Not nice opening 1GB .txt.


[07/10/2021 1:19 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Also what about backups, is there a safe way of handling a DB backup while the site is live? I think not? Do people just write a maintenance script to run quickly then restart the pool?


[07/10/2021 1:21 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Is just stopping and cloning disks even an option?

No, hoping to add it later. No redis, postgree.


[07/10/2021 10:25 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Not sure how to convert addresses, and not 100% sure how things are with ERG but you need to use a legacy address in most cases IIRC, or it can't process the coinbase transaction?

seems to be a problem authorizing the miner


[07/10/2021 11:29 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
At some point I will install vanilla NOMP and add a few random coins so I understand how it works, get it working with a coin that is easy to setup like LTC. Then I may be able to start helping. I need to see it all working first, but TBH it's probably over my head adding a new coin that isn't a simple clone of one of the "core" type coins.


[07/10/2021 11:34 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I'm really starting to fall in love with  mining core TBH.


[07/10/2021 11:35 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647

[07/10/2021 11:36 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
The worst part of all this for me is the UI. I have no front end skills really. I'm in the process of learning a bit more and getting to grips with using the API.

so another new pool?

yep, by the dev/maintainer of miningcore


[07/10/2021 6:55 PM] Nythain#6769
Lol, so thats why he was here. Hopefully it makes it into the github source.


[07/10/2021 7:01 PM] andee#4722
probably will after it has been properly tested and they have got their own pool of the ground, just guessing though


[07/10/2021 7:01 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
it looks like this is being sent to the daemon: ` {"method":["9fz99bjYPa1vJR5nWutiayyDhNtrWtt15eaXRvgsbVyHyqYeNWS.hello"],"id":1625939501236,"path":"validateaddress"}` the method contains the params and I'm not sure the node can handle that path?


[07/10/2021 7:02 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
with params missing, that's what is causing the params.length error in nomp


[07/10/2021 7:04 PM] andee#4722
I removed the params.length and got `TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "options.method" property must be of type string. Received an instance of Array`


[07/10/2021 7:05 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
right, the method should be, "GET"


[07/10/2021 7:06 PM] Nythain#6769
syncing new node, decided to test setup everything in wsl instead of windows native, for my administrator sanity

[07/10/2021 7:07 PM] andee#4722
it connects fine just using the stratum, but nomp + stratum is problematic


[07/10/2021 7:07 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
something is sending the message incorrectly basically when miner is connecting, I think...just can't find it yet


[07/10/2021 7:07 PM] andee#4722
but I got constant "low diff share" no matter what I set the static diff to


[07/10/2021 7:07 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
what miner are you using?


[07/10/2021 7:08 PM] andee#4722
I need to load it in a IDE with a debugger, and not having any experience with javascript is of no help at all

I tried lol,srb,trm


[07/10/2021 7:09 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
ya, with proxy+stratum I can get nano and nbminer to mine, but nomp doesn't require stratum server and when I connect without userauth it connects but doesn't seem to mine anything


[07/10/2021 7:12 PM] andee#4722
the stratum is in your node_modules. just check package.json


[07/10/2021 8:05 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
yep, but validateaddress (or the newer getaddressinfo) doesn't seem to be in the ergo node api, which is the larger issue


[07/10/2021 8:09 PM] andee#4722
validateaddress is set to use /utils/address/ in the stratum server


[07/10/2021 8:24 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
thanks! I changed to this and miner connects with validation...not seeing shares mined yet


[07/10/2021 8:24 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
@andee @Leif Erickson how did you guys remediate the "assertion failed: Wrong char in Base58 string" issue? aka, do we need to convert ergo wallet to base58?

I haven't figured that one out yet


[07/10/2021 8:25 PM] andee#4722
@en4ble | bmoblockchain.us I haven't gotten the error, where is the address input?

[07/10/2021 8:30 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
interesting, that's good to know! for some reason that's not being detected and validateaddress is passing to the daemon in nomp

ergo-nomp is about a month old currently, is it being updated?


[07/10/2021 8:37 PM] andee#4722

I am wondering where the 40 char limit is coming from. have you seen it in the code?

because I used the rewardAddress which is 81 chars and got no errors


[07/10/2021 8:43 PM] andee#4722
why even use rewardRecipients? there is no payment system working


[07/10/2021 8:43 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
@Leif Erickson so I did recipients address, now pool is not complaining about 58 but this:
2021-07-10 19:42:12 [Pool]      [ergo] (Thread 1) Could not start pool, error with init batch RPC call: "requirement failed: Trying to decode testnet address in mainnet"

did you have this issue?


[07/10/2021 8:44 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
perhaps just to test and see what else is wrong üôÇ


[07/10/2021 8:45 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
with valid ergo wallet address in both the address (for pool deposits) and also a different valid wallet address for rewardrecipient I get `invalid address length for 9123...`

[07/10/2021 8:49 PM] andee#4722
the way I see it the requirements for the address is for btc derived coins, so there is no need to try to brute force an ergo address in there when it wont work either way


[07/10/2021 8:49 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
From what I can gather, ergo-nomp will need to be combined with the ergostratumserver (and maybe ergostratumproxy for standard miners)


[07/10/2021 8:50 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
i thought ergo-nomp had stratum included no?


[07/10/2021 8:50 PM] andee#4722
@Leif Erickson it is combined with it. but its a shitty fork in the same btclinux repo


[07/10/2021 8:50 PM] andee#4722

[07/10/2021 9:09 PM] andee#4722
I don't get why you are insisting on inputting addresses on the rewardsRecipients. use `/mining/rewardAddress` as address and just let the other one stay at the default


[07/10/2021 9:09 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
why can't we just get ERGO devs to pitch in so we all benefit?


[07/10/2021 9:11 PM] andee#4722
In my opinion, which will probably be unpopular.. without being able to put the bits and pieces together and debug it, the skills to operate a pool will also be lacking


[07/10/2021 9:11 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
not insisting it was recommended. There is no repo for /mining/rewardAdress


[07/10/2021 9:11 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
even with the updated dependency, there is still a daemon call for validateaddress that is not getting remapped.  This is causing the params.length error when a miner connects


[07/10/2021 9:11 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
we need to be able to tshoot it when it breaks


[07/10/2021 9:12 PM] andee#4722
the readme on the stratum server says this: ```not used:

"coin"
"address"
"rewardRecipients"
"p2p"```

nomp should be tracking rewards, not the stratumserver


[07/10/2021 9:13 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
where is /mining/rewardAddress?


[07/10/2021 9:13 PM] andee#4722
node API


[07/10/2021 9:14 PM] andee#4722
you are correct, and it does track it in the database. but the whole payment system is commented out in ergo-nomp because it does not work for ergo (from what I 'heard')


[07/10/2021 9:14 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
from the swagger you mean ok..

[07/10/2021 9:15 PM] andee#4722
I meant from the API üôÇ swagger is just a interface to the API


[07/10/2021 9:17 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
you got it from the swagger correct?


[07/10/2021 9:18 PM] andee#4722
its does not matter if you use swagger, curl or any other thing. what you want is /mining/rewardAddress


[07/10/2021 9:19 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
understood, and rewardAddress replaces rewardRecipients correct? What about "address" field we leave it blank/omit?


[07/10/2021 9:20 PM] andee#4722
I put the rewardAddr in address, and did nothing with rewardRecipients


[07/10/2021 9:21 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
ok, did the same but getting same error as before. Not sure where is the testnet address that is throwing that error
2021-07-10 20:03:28 [Pool]      [ergo] (Thread 1) Could not start pool, error with init batch RPC call: "requirement failed: Trying to decode testnet address in mainnet"


[07/10/2021 9:23 PM] andee#4722
do you have testnet and mainnet node running?


[07/10/2021 9:23 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
if we are running same repo your recipient should be 
    "rewardRecipients": {
        "n37vuNFkXfk15uFnGoVyHZ6PYQxppD3QqK": 0.0


[07/10/2021 9:23 PM] andee#4722
correct


[07/10/2021 9:23 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
no just mainnet


[07/10/2021 9:24 PM] andee#4722
ok, because I was confused because I forgot to change port to testnet node. and I think that was when the error went away

[07/10/2021 9:30 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
is there a method in ergo node for `mining.extranonce.subscribe`?


[07/10/2021 9:30 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
...or basically to authorize a miner


[07/10/2021 9:32 PM] andee#4722
that's done in the stratum server, no?


[07/10/2021 9:34 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
oh, actaully, seems to be a bug ... /utils/address returns, "isValid", expects "isvalid"


[07/10/2021 9:34 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
so, I'm logged in, authorized...not sure I'm getting any work tho


[07/10/2021 9:36 PM] andee#4722
what file did you edit?


[07/10/2021 9:36 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
for isvalid?


[07/10/2021 9:37 PM] andee#4722
this line authCallback(isValid);  ?


[07/10/2021 9:37 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I suppose all my worthwhile changes are in libs/poolWorker.js


[07/10/2021 9:37 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
`pool.daemon.cmd('/utils/address/'+ [workerName], 'GET', [], function (results) 
    var isValid = results.filter(function (r) {
        return r.response.isValid
    }).length > 0;
    authCallback(isValid);
});`


[07/10/2021 9:37 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
search for validateaddress, I replaced with /utils/address


[07/10/2021 9:43 PM] andee#4722

@andee @Leif Erickson@Jerry_slush @Nythain @ASCiiDiTY @Marty would you guys be interested in trying to solve this over webex/zoom/whatever and work on **one repo** instead being all over the place? We could have meeting notes/recording of the session for reference. After the merger aka end of eth there will be plenty of hash power so I wouldn't worried. Please let me know your thoughts on this suggestion. Yay or nay is fine....


[07/10/2021 10:26 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
I have access to aws so we can spin up resources really fast if we need to etc...whatever works


[07/10/2021 10:27 PM] andee#4722
I am just messing around with this and have no interest in running a pool since I would lose my mind in prod. I think I am going to start trying to make a stratum server in rust


[07/10/2021 10:27 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
understood, thanks


[07/10/2021 10:27 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
https://coinfoundry.org/pool/ergo <-- probably singals that it will be added to miningcore soon, coinfoundry = miningcore..


[07/10/2021 10:28 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Sorry I don't have the time or energy, it's too complicated and I'm confident it will be added to software I'm already using in the next month or so.


[07/10/2021 10:29 PM] andee#4722
nomp is outdated, running on several deprecated libraries


[07/10/2021 10:29 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I'm interested...kinda hoping to transition to dev in this area from current work by the end of the year


[07/10/2021 10:30 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
just need to figure out how to make some income üôÇ


[07/10/2021 10:30 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
I saw that as well many vulnerabilities. Either way at the end I would run full pen tests/vulnerability scanning to make sure its safe but still its old repo


[07/10/2021 10:30 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368

The fact miningcore was updated 8 days ago and they are actively adding coins to their pool is a major factor for me.

[07/10/2021 10:34 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
back to the `invalid address length...` issue that nomp shows for rewardRecipients, it's crazy but the only place I see that is in the ErgoStratumServer code lib/utils.js, but not in node_modules.  Maybe it's being reflected through the node (i.e. hidden in java), but I can't even find a console.log command that is presenting it...so strange


[07/10/2021 10:34 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
so they shared their source code?


[07/10/2021 10:34 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
It's been public for years.


[07/10/2021 10:35 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
could be that its just incompatible? I mean ergo wallet is using the correct 58 encode


[07/10/2021 10:36 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
if there is a way to make developing work, I'd love to build an open source pool with python/flask/gunicorn/nginx, let the architecture do much of the work ... just dreaming probably :?


[07/10/2021 10:37 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
assuming this is the source of the message, it's around like 260:  `var decoded = base58.decode(addr);

    if (decoded.length != 25){
        console.error('invalid address length for ' + addr + ' ('+decoded.length+')');
        throw new Error();
    }`


[07/10/2021 10:37 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Use legacy address if such thing exists in ergo, sorry I don't know as I only have an exchange wallet and never loaded a node. but addresses other than legacy on other coins can not make coinbase transactions (solo mining).


[07/10/2021 10:37 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
If I use a none legacy address in VTC pool it won't work.


[07/10/2021 10:37 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I'm more stumped on how this is even getting called...if I could figure that out I could adjust it to accept valid lengths


[07/10/2021 10:39 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
got to be the pool config no? can't be nothing there really


[07/10/2021 10:40 PM] andee#4722
rewardRecipients is in nomp and has nothing to do with the node's code


[07/10/2021 10:43 PM] andee#4722
seems like its only found in the stratum, and no reference to it in nomp except the pool config


[07/10/2021 10:43 PM] andee#4722
```            try {
                if (r.length === 40)
                    rObj.script = util.miningKeyToScript(r);
                else
                    rObj.script = util.addressToScript(r);

[07/10/2021 10:47 PM] andee#4722
@en4ble | bmoblockchain.us are you using the address I posted?


[07/10/2021 10:47 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
address I've got is from the node api and i don't this its testnet

don't use mine

testnet or not depends on how you start the node

[07/10/2021 11:08 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I'm thinking that maybe HWinfo has an api server you can activate, if not there will be something similar, instead of just pool stats, show stratum server stats as well, like uptime, cpu, disk, ram etc.. even temps etc...


[07/10/2021 11:09 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Like how you see on some torrent trackers they will show stat boxes for main and backup servers.

this is where the problems start


[07/11/2021 12:34 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
Can you get work for miner?


[07/11/2021 12:55 AM] kijekk#6636
one thing puzzles me - why the Blake algorithm is set instead of Autolykos?


[07/11/2021 1:02 AM] Nythain#6769
Possibly the core encryption algo autolykos is based on, like sha256 and scrypt. Each coin that uses them probably has subtle differences but all based on that type of encryption.


[07/11/2021 1:03 AM] Nythain#6769
But thats just a theory, i spent a night trying to research autolykos and blake but didnt correlate much


[07/11/2021 1:05 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
Same Here


[07/11/2021 1:05 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
Ill give it a try, keep you posted


[07/11/2021 1:17 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
Is there a good example of the miner to pool interaction? Ideally, including node calls as well?  I feel like nomp has the share system kinda working and just need to adjust for certain events?!


[07/11/2021 2:34 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Did ERG used to be on a different algo?


[07/11/2021 3:33 AM] Nythain#6769
nope, always been autolykos, originally autolykos, then the great v2


[07/11/2021 3:34 AM] Nythain#6769
but, i'm pretty sure blake is encryption method and autolykos is hashing algo


[07/11/2021 3:34 AM] Nythain#6769
there are a few more than one blake coins, and actually multiple blake encryptions


[07/11/2021 4:26 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
what is a good mindiff/maxdiff difficulty setting to test with to allow shares to easily generate?


[07/11/2021 7:44 AM] andee#4722
when using the stratum server alone I was not able to get the low diff share problem to go away no matter what number I used as diff


[07/11/2021 7:53 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
what diff settings did you try?


[07/11/2021 7:54 AM] andee#4722
H up to GH


[07/11/2021 8:10 AM] andee#4722
more correctly the other way around. got nomp running but with low diff shares?


[07/11/2021 8:29 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
did you show any shares?  I've tried min/maxDiff = 2000/6000, 2000000/6000000, connects and miner is authorized but not showing shares


[07/11/2021 9:00 AM] andee#4722
not using nomp, only with the stratum server alone


[07/11/2021 9:01 AM] andee#4722
use a miner that shows diff, maybe diff = netdiff


[07/11/2021 5:08 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647

nice


[07/11/2021 5:12 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Really enjoying it so far. Found 5 blocks already. I'm going to setup some other pools on testnet for various other coins as practise. Hopefully learn how to install the different types.


[07/11/2021 5:15 PM] Nythain#6769
well, ya already nailed one, others shouldn't be too difficult üôÇ


[07/11/2021 5:16 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
The marketing side should be interesting.


[07/11/2021 5:16 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Getting listed in things like Hive and similar is a good start.


[07/11/2021 5:19 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647

someone likes that number üòâ


[07/11/2021 8:07 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647

[07/11/2021 8:10 PM] ziggomatic#9335
i think a fair few are

do you run miningcore pools?


[07/12/2021 6:36 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
In the process of building one now http://acidpool.co.uk/


[07/12/2021 7:39 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
looking good!!


[07/12/2021 8:01 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Thanks, I'm struggling TBH. Front end stuff is not my thing. It will do for now.


[07/12/2021 11:57 AM] glasgowm#9381
Sorry just going through missed tags. Why'd you tag sakata here? lol. I had the same issue and set up log rotate, or you can set the max size in docker. @Dmitry Usov / @kushti would know best.

you doing win or linux?


[07/12/2021 4:54 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I'm still stuck on nomp/ergostratimserver and a miner actually mining a share if anyone has ideas? Seems to work well, and I think it's just config...set address to nodes wallet, set difficulty from 32 up to 2T... I expect a share is just a simpler puzzle than actual block puzzle, but can't quite get there.


[07/12/2021 6:12 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
A combination of both.


[07/12/2021 6:46 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I was actually just think to list everything used in this project but it would be pretty long.


[07/12/2021 6:47 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
We have windows server 2019 boxes, a lamp box in another location that I assume is running unbuntu, I only deal with the GUI CPanel side of that. I took some advice from here and hosted everything on different machines/locations. 

All close though.


[07/12/2021 6:51 PM] Nythain#6769
daemon and stratum are windows server right?


[07/12/2021 7:35 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Yes.


[07/12/2021 7:35 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368

awesome. hopefully you can snag them cheap


[07/12/2021 7:40 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Now if you told me to setup WHM/CPanel, or simply host a website on a windows box I'd be googling "how to setup iss"


[07/12/2021 7:40 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I think they are good for full applications, like some GUI game servers etc..


[07/12/2021 7:41 PM] Nythain#6769
i wanted a proper server but decided to just repurpose an old i5 2400


[07/12/2021 7:42 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Most of my stuff is like that, old mobos etc.. this new machine will be old, but "cost ¬£10k a decade ago" old.


[07/12/2021 7:42 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Going to put 2x 1060 6GB blowers in it, 48GB RAM

Why gpu?


[07/12/2021 7:44 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
It will mine and transcode video as well.

{Reactions}
üÜí 

[07/12/2021 7:49 PM] Nythain#6769
ugh, it should be able to transcode on the cpu


[07/12/2021 7:50 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I like playing around with lots of plex users.


[07/12/2021 7:50 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Curious to see how it handles a miner running on low priority when the transcoding kicks in.


[07/12/2021 7:51 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Should just ramp down.


[07/12/2021 7:51 PM] Nythain#6769
and that's why i'd cpu transcode which most intels are pretty darned capable of


[07/12/2021 7:51 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Not 10 year old xeons though sadly.


[07/12/2021 7:51 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Well I mean they are, but not on the scale newer intel is


[07/12/2021 7:52 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
2 blower GPUs in an overkill server is just cool üôÇ


[07/12/2021 7:52 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
New heater.


[07/12/2021 7:53 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I've never actually had a mobo and box suitable for that before.

[07/12/2021 8:13 PM] Nythain#6769
congrats


[07/12/2021 8:13 PM] Nythain#6769
so did you pick both those up? cause that top one was one hell of a deal


[07/12/2021 8:13 PM] Nythain#6769
also, what platform are you finding these on?


[07/12/2021 8:26 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
I‚Äôm done with physical hw ‚òÅÔ∏è


[07/12/2021 8:32 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
The issue is if I want 48GB of RAM in the cloud it costs too much, for this it will cost me ¬£60 for sexy samsung sticks. Just like what I would be renting. Also just a fun project TBH.


[07/12/2021 8:34 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Just the top one, I was watching loads and they all went for about ¬£125+ I'm amazed, but is loads for sale at once.


[07/12/2021 8:34 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
The case is worth loads (made by BMW), the power supplies sell for about ¬£60. Just decade old hardware I guess.


[07/12/2021 8:36 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
They can safely handle 2x 1060s on the single GPU wire as well. I'd use a server powersupply if adding more, but they also have 2 16x PCiE slots and 2 8x speed


[07/12/2021 8:36 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Perfect for a 4x 3060 Ti half limited card rig.


[07/12/2021 8:44 PM] Nythain#6769
also just perfect for well, a home server üòõ


[07/12/2021 8:44 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
It's going to be a monster, and loads better than my existing machine which is more like a decent gaming machine from 10 years ago. Will be a nice addition.


[07/12/2021 8:45 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I don't really need the power of it on my actual workstation, but being able to remote into that will be heaven.


[07/12/2021 8:47 PM] Nythain#6769
i just love all things serverry lol. hell, that could be turned into a baremetal vm station, or or or or soooo many things (with ram upgrade that is)


[07/12/2021 8:48 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Yeah I'm exactly the same. I could geek out on this stuff all day.


[07/12/2021 8:49 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
It was out of reach to me due to hardware costs and literal bad, slow residential internet for years, so I feel I waited a long time to be able to do stuff.. and even then for a long time I was still a bit bottlenecked by connection.


[07/12/2021 8:49 PM] Nythain#6769
is it sata or sas?


[07/12/2021 8:50 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I think it's sata with a caddy. Will put a boot SSD and have a couple of 3TB drives doing nothing.


[07/12/2021 8:51 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I will put 1 3TB and use the other for if it fails.


[07/12/2021 8:51 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
And get a spare PSU, they are unique.


[07/12/2021 8:52 PM] Nythain#6769
i need new spinning rust for my server. the 3tbs aren't cutting it anymore üò¶


[07/12/2021 8:53 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I could probably get away with going full SSD TBH. Would need a couple of 2TBs though.


[07/12/2021 8:53 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
It's only blockchains etc.. I have storage for other stuff.


[07/12/2021 8:53 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I wonder if housing the data/blocks on a HDD would impact performace?


[07/12/2021 8:56 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I'm going to take this chance to test a lot of coins and nodes on testnet as well. Spin up literally loads and loads to see how it handles it.


[07/12/2021 8:58 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
If you are not already following it, keep an eye n the miningcore github "discussions" about ERG.

[07/12/2021 9:02 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
If you see it working on coinfoundry it's great.


[07/12/2021 9:02 PM] Nythain#6769
curious what client that is, since there haven't been any new ergo pools recently (aside from cf but they claim they get to use it cause well, it's theirs lol)


[07/12/2021 9:03 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I'm not sure.. search the source of the websites for miningcore.js.


[07/12/2021 9:03 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Or other tell tale signs


[07/12/2021 9:04 PM] Nythain#6769
not worth that much effort lol


[07/12/2021 9:04 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Remember PROP has been added back so it's not just PPLNS no, also SOLO


[07/12/2021 9:04 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Can it even be anybody on the list?


[07/12/2021 9:04 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Doesn't make sense.


[07/12/2021 9:05 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I'm worried it will be hard to start off, that;s why I started VTC as I have enough hash to solo if needed.


[07/12/2021 9:05 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Really keen to add XMR too.


[07/12/2021 9:06 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I will need to rent hash to kick off an erg pool, but I'll have a go.


[07/12/2021 9:07 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
My UI also can't compete with some others, but then again some pools have terrible UI and are busy. But I feel places like MPH are just farms that spun up a pool to avoid costs and make more money.


[07/12/2021 9:08 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Not too worried about anything other than functionality.


[07/12/2021 9:09 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647

Yiimp UIs are always ugly.


[07/12/2021 9:09 PM] Nythain#6769
not with this community. announce it, let marketing know, and it will take off well enough. we love new pools


[07/12/2021 9:10 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I will do that, but it seems like a huge nethash.


[07/12/2021 9:11 PM] Nythain#6769
well, it worked for leaf and coinfoundry (granted they already had members but i doubt many of them went "zomg ergo!" and jumped off of whatever they were already mining)


[07/12/2021 9:11 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I'll add it and give it my best shot regardless. It fits the theme of my site which is GPU mineable coins and a UK server. I'm sick of connecting to EU. UK is too close to make it worth while.


[07/12/2021 9:12 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647

[07/12/2021 9:16 PM] Nythain#6769
5Gbps line is obscene

[07/12/2021 9:18 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647

[07/12/2021 9:19 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647

3pin 240 here üòâ


[07/12/2021 9:25 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Maybe I don't understand what grounded means.


[07/12/2021 9:26 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
So it doesn't build up static?


[07/12/2021 9:26 PM] andee#4722
no 120V here, but we do have ungrounded plugs. but grounded equipment uses schuko


[07/12/2021 9:26 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Do I need to do something special with it?


[07/12/2021 9:26 PM] andee#4722
I don't know if it helps, but I have lost 2 of those switches when there has been lightning storms


[07/12/2021 9:27 PM] andee#4722
and I noticed there was a screw on the metal case for connection to earth


[07/12/2021 9:28 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I'm hoping the reason I'm so ignorant to this is because the 3rd wire in our plugs is a ground wire.


[07/12/2021 9:28 PM] Nythain#6769
cisco switches usually come with a grounding lug to ground the hardware itself. at least the rack mount ones do. usually connected to a grounded rack or ran to earth like andee said


[07/12/2021 9:29 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Ah okay, the only time i remember seeing this is on record players. Seems I need to educate myself.


[07/12/2021 9:30 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I must be doing something right though as nothing ever seems to just break for no reason here.

[07/12/2021 9:31 PM] andee#4722
this is the same as our 2 pin power supplies, earth is there but not connected to anything


[07/12/2021 9:31 PM] andee#4722
that's usually how those small power supplies are built


[07/12/2021 9:32 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Huh.. okay yeah i have some devices like that, but that isn't a normal plug.

I know, but you don't have connectors like that on a switch power supply was my point

What is the reason a lot of these z600s have two GPUs? CAD?


[07/12/2021 9:35 PM] andee#4722
this got way sidetracked though üòÜ  maybe those cisco's aren't that good, since its the only network gear that has been intolerant of lightning


[07/12/2021 9:35 PM] Nythain#6769

you should have got three of them and given one to me üôÇ


[07/12/2021 9:36 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
This is used in serious production BTW.


[07/12/2021 9:37 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I could install the new autocad but give him a VM with the old version in too.

NGL the feeling of not paying a fee is nice.


[07/12/2021 9:40 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
90% total effort so far.


[07/12/2021 9:41 PM] Nythain#6769
that's close to $200 worth of vtc you've mined there so far, not too bad for a pet project


[07/12/2021 9:42 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
This is just me and a friend.. when new version of OCM come out my site is already in the source code üôÇ I have other ways to market as well, already listed on miningpoolstats, and will write some tutorials and articles that are related and plug the pool. I will make pull requests to HiveOS etc..


[07/12/2021 9:45 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Even if nobody comes (they will) we were solo mining or p2pooling anyway. So really no major lose..


[07/12/2021 9:46 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I can't handle p2pool though, it is not efficient.


[07/12/2021 9:46 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Needs geolocking so people can only join close ones.


[07/12/2021 9:47 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
In all honesty if it gets busy and my UK traffic is over 70% I will geolock this one. I want the best latency.


[07/12/2021 9:47 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
But miningcore and mpos handle it all better anyway.


[07/12/2021 9:48 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
and what about RVN?


[07/12/2021 9:48 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I will add it, but am not a huge fan of the algo.


[07/12/2021 9:49 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
give him your zip and public ip üòõ


[07/12/2021 9:49 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Better to mine in winter.


[07/12/2021 9:49 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
core supports it? I didn't see it under source...


[07/12/2021 9:49 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
No it is the old one now x16, in source, but people know how to do it and it is coming back.


[07/12/2021 9:51 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Even custom coins are easy to add if it's on a supported algo, there is only delays when it's new algos.


[07/12/2021 9:51 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
You just need to know what source files to edit, it isn't many.


[07/12/2021 9:51 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
But somebody will do it and get it pulled in.


[07/12/2021 9:55 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Does ergo node + pool just have normal requirements or does it have some heavy use like XMR?


[07/12/2021 9:59 PM] andee#4722
I don't think ergo is even close to as heavy as XMR is for verification of shares


[07/12/2021 10:00 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I don;t think anything is TBH, not that i have found anyway. Even just using the wallet on a PC is a nightmare.


[07/12/2021 10:00 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I hate it. But I love XMR.


[07/12/2021 10:00 PM] andee#4722
adjust banning parameters on stratum server and set diff really low then spam yourself with shares to check how many shares you can handle per second


[07/12/2021 10:01 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I will do that on a testnet pool.


[07/12/2021 10:02 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
miningcore has decent protection against this though, a friend of mine has used it for a while. You can have it ban on junk and rejected shares or any combo of.


[07/12/2021 10:02 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Will need to turn it off.


[07/12/2021 10:02 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I will be spinning up loads of testnet servers in the next few weeks though. So can be more reckless with them and test.

[07/12/2021 10:07 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
The theory is pretty simple, but not being great with front end stuff, especially tables and such limits me, I'm putting some work in now.


[07/12/2021 10:08 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
^^that one looks nice but is pretty basic and has some issue. Good learning block though.


[07/12/2021 10:09 PM] Nythain#6769
yeah, just threw it out there as another example


[07/12/2021 10:09 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I will integrate it to invision power board forum blocks and pages so I can just buy a new theme for ¬£20 when I get bored. then it will match all the other components that can be added to such a big community script and also gives me a registration system that is 100% site wide. I love building communities.


[07/12/2021 10:11 PM] Nythain#6769
you're a better man than i


[07/12/2021 10:12 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
The other options are paying somebody, or learning bootstrap framework better than I already know the theme system in IPB.


[07/12/2021 10:13 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I'm not a skin guy but have made many mods for IPB.


[07/12/2021 10:14 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Can also sell the mods for miningcore UI blocks.


[07/12/2021 10:15 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I'm so annoyed with my memory, there is a site doing almost exactly what I'm trying to describe but I forget the name.


[07/12/2021 10:15 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
They have all their coins as forum blocks on the portal.


[07/12/2021 10:15 PM] Nythain#6769
interesting


[07/12/2021 10:16 PM] Nythain#6769
well, i'm out for a bit. off work, time to head home, play with teh kiddo, drink a few beers then hope the kiddo falls asleep before me so i can get some pc time in


[07/12/2021 10:17 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Steps are this:
1. Learn REST API
2. Get nice theme
3. Include a .js file in the page
4. start adding the varibles to the right place
5. some things for tables or lists will need HTML appending on the end to make it work if that makes sense?
6. Learn the bootstrap pagition system
7. Learn the bootstrap charts/graphs system


[07/12/2021 10:17 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Okay later


[07/12/2021 10:20 PM] andee#4722
for that I would use https://github.com/coinfoundry/miningcore/wiki/API

{Reactions}
üôè 

[07/12/2021 11:44 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
My main issue is not the API, but being generally useless at making a high end pretty website with all those special touches. I've seen friends spin up lovely stuff in visual studio in minutes. I'm that guy that uses notepad++ and enjoys PHP instead.


[07/12/2021 11:46 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I'll get pretty far.. but will eventually have to outsource for the really fancy pants stuff. I'm putting in some work to learn what i can but I'd rather concentrate on optimisation, latency, all that good stuff that will make us better even if we only have 2 miners. People say I'm wrong, but I believe we can gain a tiny advantage. Maybe even some geolocking.


[07/12/2021 11:47 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Today was spent optimisation the front end

[07/12/2021 11:48 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
The setting up of pool was the bit I has a learning curve with, keep machines online until they die is my thing.


[07/12/2021 11:49 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
When i get some testnet servers up I will invite people to attack them, so we can see what happens.

[07/12/2021 11:51 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
We can give them choice, a server where all is hosted on one, and one where everything is hosted on either separate machines, or separate machines and locations.


[07/12/2021 11:52 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Then get some popcorn and watch the logs.


[07/12/2021 11:53 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Also windows boxes vs linux, i know linux has lower attack surface area, but it is much more likely for a newbie to set something bad and shoot themselves in the foot.


[07/12/2021 11:53 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I feel like win server and win server core are more accepted in 2021


[07/12/2021 11:54 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
2022 preview is honestly impressive if you have high end enterprise needs or just like playing about with that stuff for fun.


[07/12/2021 11:54 PM] marcioglaser#3380
@ASCiiDiTY  Is this pool Vertcoin or is it ERGO?
I don't understand what they are managing to do.


[07/12/2021 11:54 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
For now it is just VTC. I'm waiting for miningcore to add ERG support. Will probably get an XMR pool up next, then ERG.


[07/12/2021 11:55 PM] marcioglaser#3380
I look for someone I can hire to build an ergo pool for me. Or make a business partnership.


[07/12/2021 11:55 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Sorry I know it is a bit off topic, but this is the only place I found with people interested in hosting pools.


[07/12/2021 11:55 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Soon I will add ERG.


[07/12/2021 11:56 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I can help you in a few months time if you don;t find somebody before, but i need to setup and run it first myself.


[07/12/2021 11:56 PM] marcioglaser#3380

[07/12/2021 11:56 PM] Nythain#6769

[07/12/2021 11:57 PM] marcioglaser#3380
I understand. I need it right now. It's a business project, so being ahead is important,


[07/12/2021 11:58 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Cool. I'm not trying to advertise here, I have stuff in place for it to grow in bursts when added to mining software and organically. I just like chatting here because there are loads of people interested in the same thing. ERG would be added if I knew how to do it manually. I am now committed to the couple of friends and myself that is mining VTC. Once others come and I make the ERG pool (and other pools) I can mine what i like.


[07/12/2021 11:59 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Was just the easiest entry point as I have enough hash to solo.


[07/12/2021 11:59 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
XMR next then by the time I finish that MC will have ERG.


[07/13/2021 12:00 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647

Another good experience, Veil was the last time.


[07/13/2021 12:04 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Don't like the confusion over the special payment plan, but it clearly works so doesn't matter.


[07/13/2021 12:04 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
What are pros and cons of PROP? From miner and pool owner view? Need to seed wallet a lot? Or is that PPS?


[07/13/2021 12:05 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I always choose PPLNS myself when mining.


[07/13/2021 12:06 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Also what happens if I give value to testnet coins? this won't stop playing on my mind. What if I start accepting testnet coins as payment? And convincing other to do the same?


[07/13/2021 12:07 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
If I let you pay me ¬£100 in testnet coin for something it has value no? If I repeat it enough and others do the same???


[07/13/2021 12:11 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
We‚Äôve been trying to get ergo working on a super old engine but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it. At least from security stand point. All the current ergo pool operators hold their script tight so unless we get a valid git we are kinda stuck‚Ä¶


[07/13/2021 12:12 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647

It's hard to find techy chat TBH now days in the crypto space. I get so used to people trolling and just being dumb that I probably snap a bit on certain site or may be a bit more condescending. I normally hide in bitcointalk.


[07/13/2021 12:17 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
My first mission was to make payment gateways that used no third parties but also could be run on shared LAMP/Cpanel hosting. I did that many years ago, with xPUB key/s.


[07/13/2021 12:18 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Now pools is my new obsession.


[07/13/2021 12:18 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Also maybe a auction site with crypto. Like a DNM but on clearnet and with real life rules.


[07/13/2021 12:19 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Just set the entry price high to only attract bulk PC part sellers etc.. not so much people who will cause issues over ¬£10.


[07/13/2021 12:21 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
And start lobbying for two types of tax rules from crypto, if you earn it fast enough no cap gains just income tax.

I'd like to get a wild west but slightly controlled legit market going for ex corporate sales. Basically stock clearance on old servers, and in turn anybody who does similar in other industries I don't understand. Somewhere you can come and shop for bulk sales, without an idiot being in charge of escrow.

I dunno but it must be better than a 1060, I have issue trying to work out what the hashrate would be, but trust me, it's a good deal. they would pay for themselves easily.

Day #5


[07/13/2021 1:34 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I'm in my element right now, not even trying yet. Setting it up was the hard part.. setting it up in an OS I can actually manage was even harder than setting it up in Linux that I would probably fail with in 999 situation. Setting up the pool and understanding how all the components worked was the hardest part. The first block at a crazy 221% effort nearly killed us, we almost lost all hope of humanity. It was like the end days.. then boom, block after block. This is the fun bit..


[07/13/2021 1:34 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
When I sober up I will make efforts to advertise.


[07/13/2021 1:35 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647

[07/13/2021 2:03 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Maybe setting it up is the wrong phrase, fully understanding how it was all working, and getting it to work on an OS that nobody in the crypto space uses. When I got stuck at time, I even had friends that knew how to set it up, but they could only trouble shoot in linux.


[07/13/2021 2:04 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
It also dawned on me at one point, that if I didn't do the whole thing myself, I was setting myself up to fail.

Don;t let people bully you into using linux if you are a win server admin. If my pool went down on nix it would take me 3x the time to react properly. Windows I would be ready to throw in a cloned disk and be up in 5 minutes again.

The only thing I don't like about miningcopre is lack of an official UI as a base to work from. Integrating features like withdraw limit per miner with the IP based auth etc.. is kinda complicated.

Gets to the point where static HTML/js is not enough.


[07/13/2021 8:42 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647

What they have there is a full server build that hosts on :3000 pretty sure they are not using mining core.

@ASCiiDiTY not sure this is useful (and it's linux, lol), but I have been working with @Marty on an ergo nomp pool.  It'll be working soon, and mhm_sam convinced us to open source the work.  When it's up, if you are interested I'll have the node, redis and pool running in docker (docker-compose).  If I get some time I can add some notes on dev'ing with docker as well (likely have multiple docker-compose.yml files you can get an idea from)

seems so simple when you say it like that


[07/16/2021 1:25 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
What if I do and can gather enough people that will do the same? People said the same about Bitcoin for years.

[07/16/2021 1:26 AM] Snax#3268
there isn't an answer. Value isn't something you can measure


[07/16/2021 1:26 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
It's something you can dictate if you have enough cash to burn though. If I pay you 1000 TN coins now it has value.


[07/16/2021 1:27 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Or more importantly, if I let YOU pay me 1000 TN coins.


[07/16/2021 1:27 AM] Snax#3268
sure, but then someone will create another testnet. It's free to deploy again.


[07/16/2021 1:27 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
For something of high value, and keep repeating it.


[07/16/2021 1:28 AM] Snax#3268
it's a useless exercise. You're effectively throwing money away doing it


[07/16/2021 1:28 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Yeah but they need to get support for their chain. Correct me if i'm wrong, but it's no different to any other chain. If I fork a core wallet and force it to launch on test net, or do whatever is needed.


[07/16/2021 1:28 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
It is a useless exercise I agree


[07/16/2021 1:28 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647

[07/16/2021 1:29 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Is it really for nothing though, i can see the headlines now.


[07/16/2021 1:30 AM] Snax#3268
why not just fork the coin and then pump that?


[07/16/2021 1:30 AM] Snax#3268
instead of using the dedicated testnet


[07/16/2021 1:30 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Anarchy.


[07/16/2021 1:30 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
There is nothing to stop a group of people that have a lot of goods from declaring it now has value.


[07/16/2021 1:31 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Apart from bankrupcy.


[07/16/2021 1:31 AM] Nythain#6769
Would also wreck testnet, basically making it erg2 as more people mined it due to actual value. New testnet would be borned


[07/16/2021 1:31 AM] Snax#3268
yeah


[07/16/2021 1:32 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Agreed.


[07/16/2021 1:32 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I'm not thinking of doing it BTW, just some crazy shower thoughts.


[07/16/2021 1:33 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Because unlike cloning a coin, somebody with little skills or simple instructions could help hijack an existing chain.


[07/16/2021 1:33 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
That has 0 diff

I've been looking at some frameworks today all based around making apps with REST API into UIs. Pretty interesting stuff with enough advance option like pagination, charts etc.. I can;t get ingratiating it with IPB out of my head though, it's likely the route I will take. It has so many pros when done.


[07/16/2021 1:39 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Bro, you should setup a miningcore pool now with an easy coin like LTC or anything, and work on your UI ready for the ERG release. This could be like the RU / US space race.

ok im dumb


[07/18/2021 7:34 AM] zargarzadehmoein#2928
A proxy is used to operate in a pool and should be connected to a stratum server, not to a node


[07/18/2021 7:35 AM] ProSavage#7131
yeah I just figured that out haha


[07/18/2021 7:35 AM] ProSavage#7131
so I have the official stratum server working


[07/18/2021 7:35 AM] ProSavage#7131
and I connected lolminer to the stratum and it is mining!

I want to know how one can figure out the poolside hashrate etc

[07/18/2021 7:36 AM] ProSavage#7131
poolside hashrate is none


[07/18/2021 7:52 AM] ProSavage#7131
I've looked through ErgoStratumProxy's code


[07/18/2021 7:52 AM] ProSavage#7131
I dont see anywhere, that is calculating a miner's hashrate poolside.


[07/18/2021 7:52 AM] ProSavage#7131
@zargarzadehmoein would you happen to know?


[07/18/2021 7:59 AM] zargarzadehmoein#2928
This code does not calculate the hash rate, this code is a reference code, so some features may not be implemented in it


[07/18/2021 7:59 AM] ProSavage#7131
ok I see!


[07/18/2021 7:59 AM] ProSavage#7131
so I need to be storing how long its taking per share and diff


[07/18/2021 8:03 AM] zargarzadehmoein#2928
yes
for calculate hashrate: `aggregate_difficulty_of_shares_in_PERIOD / PERIOD`


[07/18/2021 8:03 AM] ProSavage#7131
ok I was gonna say


[07/18/2021 8:03 AM] ProSavage#7131
that would be network hashrate what u said before


[07/18/2021 8:04 AM] ProSavage#7131
what does agregate_difficulty of shares mean


[07/18/2021 8:04 AM] ProSavage#7131
I'm new to blockchain in general, just getting into making pools and stuff, sorry for any dumb questions.


[07/18/2021 8:05 AM] zargarzadehmoein#2928
sum of difficulties


[07/18/2021 8:05 AM] ProSavage#7131
I understand that more difficulty means the server will award my miner more shares


[07/18/2021 8:06 AM] ProSavage#7131
so Id want to store my miner's shares + difficulty
so like 10 shares @ 8 difficulty


[07/18/2021 8:06 AM] ProSavage#7131
so I'd end up with 80 shares in period / period


[07/18/2021 8:07 AM] ProSavage#7131
but ofc there must be some multiplier that converts my share  + difficulty into hash


[07/18/2021 8:07 AM] ProSavage#7131
because this does not make sense


[07/18/2021 8:07 AM] ProSavage#7131
so I get valid shares * diff / 60 sec or something


[07/18/2021 8:18 AM] vorujack#1729
Hi.
There are no multiplier
calculation formula is simple
if you have n share with difficulties [d1 ... dn] in period of M seconds 
then total calculated hash in M second is 
SUM(d1..dn)
and hashrate is
SUM(d1..dn)/M
consider that difficulty can changed according to network hashrate


[07/18/2021 8:31 AM] ProSavage#7131
Can I get a numeric example please?
You are telling me to sum difficulties from 1 to difficulty * n share?


[07/18/2021 8:33 AM] ProSavage#7131
Like instead of storing shares I store the difficulty of each share?


[07/18/2021 8:34 AM] ProSavage#7131
Then add just diffs?


[07/18/2021 8:34 AM] ProSavage#7131
And the /M is that just a minute?


[07/18/2021 8:35 AM] vorujack#1729
see explorer block from height 534799 to 534790


[07/18/2021 8:37 AM] vorujack#1729
difficulty of all blocks are 1639157088649216
duration of mining these blocks are 11:46:02 to 12:02:41  (16:39 or 999 seconds)


[07/18/2021 8:39 AM] vorujack#1729
so hashrate is (1639157088649216 * 10) / 999  = 14.92 TH/s


[07/18/2021 8:39 AM] vorujack#1729
Explorer calculate Hashrate for one day (720 block)


[07/18/2021 8:41 AM] ProSavage#7131
Okay makes sense! 

So I need to present shares are blocks and add up each shares diff


[07/18/2021 8:42 AM] vorujack#1729
Shares are same as blocks except that difficulty is lower than network difficulty


[07/18/2021 8:44 AM] ProSavage#7131
Right.
Also I had a hash rate of about 120 mhs client side and waited about 15 min to find a share and see if the ErgoStratumPool would log it


[07/18/2021 8:44 AM] ProSavage#7131
I never got one, was I just really unlucky or is it normal


[07/18/2021 8:45 AM] ProSavage#7131
I say this because I see shares in eth all the time


[07/18/2021 8:49 AM] vorujack#1729
according to current state of Mainnet if you have 13.9 TH/s every 2 minutes you find a solution.
so if your stratum server difficulty set to 200 (for example) and you have 139 GH/s every minutes you can find a share.
you have 120 MH/s shares so you must set your pool difficulty to 10^5 to find about one share every minutes


[07/18/2021 5:03 PM] ProSavage#7131
I've been told increasing the diff means it would find them faster


[07/18/2021 5:06 PM] ProSavage#7131
I told it to log when a share is submitted

[07/18/2021 5:44 PM] ProSavage#7131
but lolminer etc do not


[07/18/2021 5:44 PM] ProSavage#7131
I presume they implemented the RPC or something different


[07/18/2021 5:46 PM] ProSavage#7131
by not working, I mean they are not finding/submitting shares


[07/18/2021 5:46 PM] vorujack#1729
we dont check LOL miner. but for NBMiner and dome other miners you must set multiplyDifficulty to true in your port configuration on pool


[07/18/2021 5:46 PM] ProSavage#7131
yeah I have done so.


[07/18/2021 5:46 PM] ProSavage#7131
from what I see the official miner uses HTTP


[07/18/2021 5:46 PM] ProSavage#7131
but I see other miners use stratum tcp or smth right?


[07/18/2021 5:47 PM] ProSavage#7131
which is why you even need the proxy


[07/18/2021 5:47 PM] vorujack#1729
official miner works with node and by using proxy connected to stratum setver using TCP


[07/18/2021 9:35 PM] ProSavage#7131
are there any good resources on the stratum server on implementing your own from scratch?


[07/19/2021 12:44 AM] Nythain#6769
All miners can handle http. Not sure which if any dont support stratum still, proxy acts a middleman between stratum server and miners to ensure compatability. At least thats my take away of the different elements.


[07/19/2021 3:22 AM] ProSavage#7131
Yeah okay


[07/19/2021 3:22 AM] ProSavage#7131
What about how jobs are created and how shares are allocated


[07/19/2021 3:22 AM] ProSavage#7131
I‚Äôm relatively new to crypto in gneberal and cannot find like any docs on how a pools mechanics really work so one can implement it


[07/19/2021 3:29 AM] Nythain#6769
that, as far as i know is handled by the stratum server. i mean, the stratum server gets new block heights from the node, then creates the job to send to the miners via the proxy, and controls share difficulty (also other stuff but that's the quick and dirty of job/share distribution). i'm probably not the best person to ask, as there are others here who have actually set pools up, i'm just running on my tip toe into the code of each element of a pool


[07/19/2021 4:12 AM] ProSavage#7131
do you know of anyone specifically I can ask?
I am looking for specifics, like how even do I create a job etc.


[07/19/2021 4:12 AM] ProSavage#7131
I'd like to make a open source ergo mining stratum with all the features I need


[07/19/2021 4:24 AM] Nythain#6769
not off the top of my head, but if you stick around this channel, and pay attention to dev-support, autolykos, and node you can catch people asking about stuff and figure out who has experience/who is a pool operator/who is trying to learn the same thing as you


[07/19/2021 4:25 AM] ProSavage#7131
do you think dev-support is appropriate for me if I am building a stratum server for *ergo*?


[07/19/2021 4:25 AM] Nythain#6769
i think people have asked algo specific questions there in the past relating to pools. not sure if it's "appropriate" but worth at least tuning in to, to see who's asking what


[07/19/2021 4:31 AM] ProSavage#7131
does job creation depend on the algorithm?


[07/19/2021 4:31 AM] ProSavage#7131

What do people think of this.... PPLNS + mod... normal PPLNS, but say the bock reward is 25 coins okay.. instead of splitting the 25 coins, split 24, and give the block finder the extra coin?


[07/20/2021 12:42 AM] ProSavage#7131
I mean its pure luck


[07/20/2021 12:42 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
It is, but is it an incentive?


[07/20/2021 12:42 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Is it a huge turn off to small miners....


[07/20/2021 12:43 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I just feel if somebody went to the effort of getting loads of hashrate and finds loads of blocks for a pool, they should be rewarded more. Maybe it's a good idea, maybe not.


[07/20/2021 12:46 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
TBH making rules, setting etc.. turn away small miners isn't a bad thing IMHO.. I kiinda try to do it.. small miners bring latency issues etc.. latency and efficiency is my main concern.


[07/20/2021 12:47 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
There must be an edge, I want it.


[07/20/2021 12:49 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Luck spread over a long period of time just works out to 100% effort. Unless your pool has some type of defect.


[07/20/2021 12:53 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
But I wonder, could we get 94% effort, by being more efficient than other pools? Probably not. They all have multiple locations, but how efficient are they really?


[07/20/2021 12:57 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I feel a  pool with server hosted in the UK, with all UK miners is more efficient than a mixed pool, or even sightly mixed pool? Am I wrong? Is it possible to stay around 95% total effort?


[07/20/2021 1:02 AM] ProSavage#7131
I've made progress on my custom stratum


[07/20/2021 1:02 AM] ProSavage#7131
I can create jobs, poll for new blocks, and then update the job


[07/20/2021 1:02 AM] ProSavage#7131
also in source found that ur supposed to send the `msg`, `b`, and `pk` to the miners to make them solve the block...


[07/20/2021 1:02 AM] ProSavage#7131
so I have those gotten


[07/20/2021 1:03 AM] ProSavage#7131
but I still do not know how this shares stuff works


[07/20/2021 1:03 AM] ProSavage#7131
I understand that you have to prove you're actually working on the block and not just saying you are


[07/20/2021 1:03 AM] ProSavage#7131
but how does that even work


[07/20/2021 1:25 AM] Nythain#6769
This could also incentivise more small miners who otherwise might not be getting a very large slice of the pie without a little luck.


[07/20/2021 1:28 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Yeah I get that. Maybe I'm being a bit selfish. I'd rather have my node with lots of local, low latency people.


[07/20/2021 1:29 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
If a small miner did get the block, it would be a huge reward.


[07/20/2021 1:30 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
But realistically, the promotion was a half sham, we know that either me or kieran will get 90% of the blocks.


[07/20/2021 1:31 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I'll pay him obviously, but wont pay myself.


[07/20/2021 5:49 AM] DQF#9882
is there any docs help me to host a pool?


[07/20/2021 6:52 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
I have been mulling over numbers for pools... Based on .9% pool fee, that's about 50 ergs a month for each Th/s (approximated based on wooly) don't hold me to that. So, when I hear small pool, 1Ths is about 1000 people with 3 Vega 56s on average?  I'm kinda doing these in my head... Am I way off?


[07/20/2021 7:47 AM] andee#4722
your calculation for how much they earn on the fee seems way off


[07/20/2021 7:50 AM] andee#4722
for 50 ERG they only have to mine 82.3 blocks a month


[07/20/2021 8:47 AM] mhs_sam#1471
Ergo Stratum Server is updated:
- fix calculation of 'b' for miner
- fix vardiff tuning
- add 'extraNonce1Size' configuration to the 'start.js' file; so 'extraNonce2Size' = 8 - 'extraNonce1Size'
- mitigate the share rejection issue caused by 'extraNonce2Size'

[07/20/2021 2:09 PM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
Indeed, they're similar.  Nvidia came out with the Ti's because they're 3090s rejects.

[07/20/2021 2:45 PM] andee#4722
higher diff = harder shares

the closer you come to net diff the harder it gets

[07/20/2021 2:46 PM] andee#4722
I don't know what format the config is in, maxdiff seems to be one digit longer than if expressed in Hash/s

```"3256": { //Another port for your miners to connect to, this port does not use varDiff

[07/20/2021 2:47 PM] ProSavage#7131
this is on static for me right now and its finding shares once a minute or so


[07/20/2021 2:47 PM] ProSavage#7131
does it not work the same way


[07/20/2021 2:47 PM] ProSavage#7131
is it inversely done when its vardiff?


[07/20/2021 2:49 PM] andee#4722
then try setting 164319 as minDiff


[07/20/2021 2:49 PM] andee#4722

I haven't tried the latest stratum commits. may check it out later, had problems with any diff last time I tried

either very low, or netdiff


[07/20/2021 3:57 PM] mwalol#0301
i have restarted the node, and it resync from scratch is there a setting should be forced on the conf to avoid this situation? what is wired is that the data folder was 6.5Go and didn't changed


[07/20/2021 4:02 PM] andee#4722
if it worked fine with the other miner, its probably because of nvminer. maybe some of the later changes to the server messed with something. the initial problems was the server not working with anything else than nvminer


[07/20/2021 4:02 PM] mwalol#0301
yes i'm willing to use trex, but now i'm asking about the node itself


[07/20/2021 4:03 PM] andee#4722
just be aware that t-rex has had problems with autolykos. I don't know if they are fully resolved


[07/20/2021 4:04 PM] mwalol#0301
my node was synced and i changed wallet.secretStorage.secretDir setting on the conf and it's now resyncing from scratch is that normal?


[07/20/2021 4:04 PM] andee#4722
unless you move the wallet folder to the new location, my guess would be yes


[07/20/2021 4:05 PM] andee#4722
it needs to sync the wallet at least


[07/20/2021 4:05 PM] mwalol#0301
ah! so i just add this settings and it resync from scratch

yes i have add mining to false for now until it sync then i will change it to true and restart


[07/20/2021 4:06 PM] mwalol#0301
i think this will not force resync from scratch since the wallet will stay the same


[07/20/2021 4:07 PM] andee#4722
with 1TH at pool and 13TH nethash that would be like 138 blocks a day on 100% effort? or am I totally off?


[07/20/2021 4:08 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I just did a quick scan for like 10 days and there was 25ish blocks at ~12Th/s in the sample so I extrapolated numbers from there


[07/20/2021 4:10 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
well, somehow I got closer to 3 blocks a day I think, which I estimated to 90 blocks a month, at 67.5 ergs/block...so 600ish ergs/mt or 30/day for 12Ths, so 2.5ish a day per Th/s...something like that


[07/20/2021 4:12 PM] andee#4722
in a 30 day month with avg. blocktime of 2min there are 21600 blocks


[07/20/2021 4:13 PM] andee#4722
if nethash is 12TH, and pool is 1TH, 21600 / 12 = 1800


[07/20/2021 4:17 PM] mwalol#0301

that undefined is it an issue?


[07/20/2021 4:32 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I believe pools typically calc thier own hashrate, rather than use miner-reported.  This is why folks tend to ask why thier hashrate doesn't match the pool's hashrate


[07/20/2021 4:42 PM] mwalol#0301
how they calc the hashrate to know approximation of the provided by the miners?


[07/20/2021 4:56 PM] Pgr456#1839
Pools calculate the hashrate of the connected miners based on the submitted shares in a specific time and the difficulty of these shares. See the explanation from vorujack:

[07/21/2021 4:45 AM] ProSavage#7131
target is the difficulty the network tries to maintain so that the rate of mining is the same.

So is the `b` value that the `/mining/candidate` endpoint gives us the target?

Why do we divide it by diff1?
I googled the diff1 constant and its the first difficulty of bitcoin.


[07/21/2021 7:59 AM] vorujack#1729
this is calculation of initial difficulty. difficulty adjusted later when we want to send job to miner


[07/21/2021 8:29 AM] ProSavage#7131
what is the intial difficulty mean?
Like i checked it adn i get value like 360000

4g is the most common min diff. 3g really helps us small miners but many pools give no fucks about small miners. And one large pool i know of has an even higher min diff.


[07/23/2021 4:40 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Feels high even with 285MH.


[07/23/2021 4:40 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
0.5 shares a minute IIRC


[07/23/2021 4:41 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
What's stopping people using vardiff?


[07/23/2021 5:41 PM] Nythain#6769
Most people do. Thought we were talking the initial/minimum share diff


[07/23/2021 10:44 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Ahh, the min diff was just too high for me.


[07/23/2021 10:44 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
So it never changed.


[07/23/2021 10:44 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
What's the reason for the high min diff?


[07/24/2021 1:22 AM] Nythain#6769
Well it shouldnt be to high.


[07/24/2021 1:23 AM] Nythain#6769
You want a min diff that is "effective" yet still allows some/all miners to submit shares.


[07/24/2021 1:24 AM] Nythain#6769
Popular consensus with ergo pools is 4g, though 50% of the reason i love and mine wooly is 3g. Cant get shares as often/at all with heros 4g


[07/24/2021 1:26 AM] Nythain#6769
Any lower than 3g and they are pretty much garbage. Any more than 4g and youre excluding some miners. Dont know how many of us really small miners there are but im wooly for life for this reason. Then again, most operators could give a shit less about me so screw them lol


[07/24/2021 1:32 AM] ProSavage#7131
my pool software is up and running with 3GH pointed to it üòÑ


[07/24/2021 1:32 AM] ProSavage#7131

[07/24/2021 1:51 AM] Nythain#6769
Awesome! You are a total pro savage!


[07/24/2021 9:40 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
If it wasn't too high it would adjust. 0.5 shares per minute on my rig is not in line with any other coins, vardiff would normally aim for 4-6 shares per minute, at least that's what I would set it to.


[07/24/2021 9:40 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
What makes ERG different in this respect?


[07/24/2021 9:42 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I remember similar with ETC, is it just a thing on networks with a much higher hashrate? that the min diff needs to be higher?


[07/24/2021 12:30 PM] andee#4722
higher diff shares reduces load on the pools servers


[07/24/2021 10:20 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Ah okay, makes sense.


[07/26/2021 10:14 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
When running a pool with hundreds of miners, what is it that will bottle neck the server first? CPU?


[07/26/2021 10:49 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Is the stress just similar to a busy game server?


[07/26/2021 10:53 PM] Nythain#6769
I would guess cpu, though babdwidth will be pretty important at that point too.


[07/26/2021 11:01 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Yeah I do wonder at what point the connection will give out, but honestly I think we have it pretty good with modern day connections. I've hosted chat sites in the past on shared servers with much less than our current plans decades ago, loads online 24/7 and they were fine. Same with game servers. It's hard to tell without seeing it, but looks like it will just be CPU and is not even a slight worry. Adding more coins will obviously use more ram etc.. but yeah. I only managed to get about 20 online so far.


[07/26/2021 11:04 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Still waiting to upgrade from 12GB to 24GB, I ordered the wrong ram. Luckily I got a crazy deal on what I did buy and can probably sell for twice as much and maybe go for 48GB instead.


[07/26/2021 11:05 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Didn't realise there were two revisions of HP z600 boards.


[07/26/2021 11:06 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I need 2x 1060 6GB, so the server makes money not costs.


[07/26/2021 11:08 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
And some kind of log manager/splitter/organiser.


[07/26/2021 11:10 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Next weekend I am going to start setting up lots of different coins on testnet. A friend from another server has a coin on scrypt, but converting to verthash soon. I want to try and add this, it should be simple. But i like the idea of adding some random new coins that nobody cares about, and it;s also practise in adding coins that may not be supported by default.


[07/26/2021 11:11 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
And practise of how to deal with a coin moving to new algo.


[07/26/2021 11:12 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I need a way to have an API for actual server stats too, CPU usage, RAM usage, Disk usage, all that good stuff.


[07/26/2021 11:19 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
At what point does log size become an issue if it needs to be written to constantly? Does it even matter with modern specs?


[07/28/2021 10:35 AM] Alien Œ£ Crypto#4489
@ProSavage did we figure out how to calculate submitted shares for pay outs?


[07/28/2021 11:44 AM] Reggerriee#5482

Hello everybody!


[07/31/2021 5:07 PM] Shraier#8873
Looking to host a mining pool for ergocoin, wondering which mining pool software you are using and which front-end you suggest to start with


[07/31/2021 5:09 PM] Shraier#8873
What's the difference between ergostratumserver and miningcore (except one is based on .NET core and the other on node.js)?


[07/31/2021 5:33 PM] andee#4722
the first is a stratum server for ergo, the other is a full pool solution but has no support for erg currently


[07/31/2021 5:33 PM] Shraier#8873
I get it, just being through the docs of miningcore


[07/31/2021 5:34 PM] Shraier#8873
what about web front-end for the stratum server to start with?


[07/31/2021 6:19 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Most people start with this one for miningcore: https://github.com/minernl/Miningcore.WebUI

[07/31/2021 6:57 PM] Nythain#6769
As for ergo your options are pretty small right now. *Try* to hack the crap outa nomp/yiimp/whatever. *Hope* that miningcore releases their ergo implementation soon. Or create your own either from total scratch or built upon the already existing stratum server and proxy.


[07/31/2021 7:03 PM] ProSavage#7131
Be a chad


[07/31/2021 7:03 PM] ProSavage#7131
choose the last option


[07/31/2021 7:23 PM] Nythain#6769
it's honestly the best option right now anyways. at least then you know wtf is what and how everything works right


[08/01/2021 8:58 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I'm hoping to start a ground up pool later this year, maybe early next.  I plan to use python, flask, nginx, gunicorn, redis or MySQL, docker and vuejs or react.  One goal would be to build a boilerplate so others can easily setup a pool and somewhat to support decentralization...anyway, dm if interested.


[08/01/2021 9:06 PM] andee#4722
I am going to start on a stratum server written in rust, time will tell if it will work out ü§û


[08/01/2021 9:27 PM] ProSavage#7131
im planning on rust for v2 of my stratum i wrote recently :KEKW:

what did you use for the first version? probably starting on it this week, especially if it continues raining üôÇ


[08/01/2021 9:45 PM] ProSavage#7131
typescript


[08/02/2021 5:33 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
Rust does seem like a great choice...I'm on the fence about typescript since it's not quite a language


[08/02/2021 5:34 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
I did do a project in typescript and the selling point was strong typing...feels like it's just jealous of java or something lol


[08/02/2021 5:47 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
..sry, I'm just trolling on typescript some :)


[08/02/2021 3:36 PM] ProSavage#7131
it's selling point is typing and readability


[08/02/2021 3:36 PM] ProSavage#7131
along with allowing u to compile to older js version targets


[08/02/2021 3:37 PM] ProSavage#7131
javascript is a great tool to rapidly build your applications in, and no types is a issue, thats all it really needs to solve


[08/02/2021 3:37 PM] ProSavage#7131
in the end my code is javascript in prod.


[08/02/2021 6:04 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
Ya, I like the idea of a superset, I'm just skeptical it will be resilient over time and likely to split due to evolution of javascript.  Also, strongly typed is great, it's just not as valuable as is promoted for projects the size of nomp (i.e. single or few maintainers).  No real problems with the language, just hesitant to embrace it fully I guess, but a great one to consider if you didn't know JavaScript!!  I'll keep an eye out your your typNomp project, perhaps you will convince me :)


[08/02/2021 7:31 PM] ProSavage#7131
its not nomp based


[08/02/2021 7:32 PM] ProSavage#7131
I built everything by hand so far.

I think the only part that could have similar code in ErgoStratumproxy since I used it as a reference to see how stuff works


[08/03/2021 1:01 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
Oh sweet!! Sorry, I guess I haven't been catching up on threads.  So, you have a full stratum in typescript?  I originally commented since I think it would be a fun project to create a highly usable pool from scratch.


[08/03/2021 1:02 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
I wouldnt touch the proxy or the node personally, only the pool really and I suppose maybe part of the stratum...anyway, just for fun


[08/03/2021 1:03 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
To be clear, superset refers to typescript and not nomp


[08/03/2021 1:28 AM] ProSavage#7131
yes full stratum in typescript


[08/03/2021 1:28 AM] ProSavage#7131
full pool in typescript actually.


[08/03/2021 2:13 AM] Leif Erickson#8939

[08/03/2021 3:46 PM] Nythain#6769
i know you already have 12 and 24hr average hashrate for the miner, possibly consider throwing in at least a 24hr per worker so miners can make sure each card/rig is performing on par? (just a suggestion, i don't even personally have multiple cards/workers but i could see it being useful info to some)

[08/03/2021 8:11 PM] apexpool#3878
Just out of curiosity: is there a standard tool (software) to setup a mining pool, or everyone should implement his own software for that?


[08/03/2021 8:44 PM] Nythain#6769
at the moment there is no real "standard". there's fairly standard pool software like nomp, yiimp, miningcore but each will require some dedication to implement ergo. and if you have that much knowledge and dedication, you're probably better off implementing your own, either from ground up or an extension of official ergo stratum server and potentially proxy

nanopool pardon me


[08/04/2021 8:59 PM] Nythain#6769
heh, that's what i figured but thought maybe i was missing a bit of info üôÇ


[08/04/2021 8:59 PM] Nythain#6769
only way to do that is pretty much get new miners into ergo and give them good options other than nano


[08/04/2021 9:00 PM] Nythain#6769
i don't see new pools attracting nano miners away... even incentives like zero fees and block find bounties haven't done much


[08/04/2021 9:01 PM] Nythain#6769
without an influx of new miners, atm new pools are just chipping away hashrate of the other smaller pools as the community joins them in support


[08/04/2021 9:01 PM] Marty#4039
yeah that's the thing


[08/04/2021 9:01 PM] Marty#4039
the same 45% of miners are just moving their hash around, nobody is leaving nanopool


[08/04/2021 9:01 PM] Marty#4039
is it because they have their own software?>


[08/04/2021 9:02 PM] Nythain#6769
it's because it's what a lot of miners were told to do, and it "works" so people are like "why bother moving"


[08/04/2021 9:03 PM] Marty#4039
who was telling them that? was it the ergoplatform website


[08/04/2021 9:03 PM] Nythain#6769
just about every "how to mine ergo" guide in existence a while back was "download nano miner, put this info here, ???, profit!"


[08/04/2021 9:03 PM] Marty#4039
ok


[08/04/2021 9:03 PM] Marty#4039
i'm working on launching a pool. when it's launched I'll try to get more youtube views than nanominer based guides üòâ


[08/04/2021 9:04 PM] Nythain#6769
when i got back into mining, i almost landed on nanopool because that's what everything was saying at the time... and for a lot of these miners, they're seeing numbers regularly so it never occurs to them that even though their payouts are frequent they're actually losing money


[08/04/2021 9:09 PM] Marty#4039
it's tough to communicate to people who aren't around here


[08/04/2021 9:20 PM] Marty#4039
anyone who's got close or has launched.. how does it work to use testnet to test payment processing? Do you just switch the node to testnet and then any mining will find blocks quite easily, or is it more complicated than that?


[08/04/2021 9:25 PM] Nythain#6769
just switch to a testnet node, make sure miner wallet addresses are testnet... and yeah, finding blocks should be considerably easier. if you really just wanted some quick tests you could set up your own small network with like, minimal difficulty üôÇ


[08/04/2021 9:28 PM] Marty#4039
so you have to generate a new wallet address too or will the same wallet work on testnet?


[08/04/2021 9:32 PM] Nythain#6769
testnet wallet addresses are different than mainnet


[08/04/2021 9:36 PM] Marty#4039

[08/06/2021 4:52 PM] ProSavage#7131
no clue I use wireshark


[08/06/2021 4:55 PM] venoox#1937
you use wireshark to analyze stratum communication?


[08/06/2021 4:59 PM] andee#4722
v1


[08/06/2021 5:01 PM] venoox#1937
thanks!


[08/06/2021 5:02 PM] venoox#1937
I'm learning how to host a pool mostly for fun and there's so much to learn about üòÑ


[08/06/2021 5:15 PM] Nythain#6769
Verily. Be sure to chat here so others can learn a little too :)


[08/06/2021 5:16 PM] Marty#4039
Btw anyone else trying to connect to testnet, it defaults to a diff port than mainnet. main is 9053, test is 9052


[08/06/2021 5:16 PM] Marty#4039
and you need to create different wallets for testnet


[08/06/2021 5:18 PM] andee#4722
would be great if you collected your findings as you go in a git repo üôÇ


[08/06/2021 5:18 PM] Marty#4039
andee what would be a good way to do that?


[08/06/2021 5:18 PM] Marty#4039
just like.. a wiki sort of?


[08/06/2021 5:22 PM] andee#4722
a readme.md with information that helps people get started would probably do it


[08/06/2021 5:23 PM] andee#4722
if you get a companion on your pool venture its a good way to make them catch up


[08/06/2021 5:24 PM] venoox#1937
I'll try to do that!


[08/06/2021 9:30 PM] Jerry_slush#5579
im really close guys.. should have a new pool by the end of the weekend


[08/06/2021 9:33 PM] Jerry_slush#5579
@ProSavage and thanks for the help yesterday.. the tips opened the flood gated for this to be finally completed after 2 months....lol


[08/06/2021 9:33 PM] ProSavage#7131
congrats.


[08/06/2021 10:43 PM] Marty#4039
@Jerry_slush did you write from scratch or start using another software


[08/06/2021 10:47 PM] Marty#4039
if autolykos is based on blake2b, why is it asic resistant?


[08/06/2021 10:49 PM] Marty#4039
memory hardness?


[08/06/2021 10:49 PM] Jerry_slush#5579
i moded both the stratum and another software


[08/06/2021 10:50 PM] Marty#4039
i am trying to use NOMP


[08/06/2021 10:50 PM] Marty#4039
it's taking a long time


[08/06/2021 10:50 PM] Marty#4039
nomp does use the stratum server


[08/06/2021 10:50 PM] Marty#4039
i don't understand the math in the whitepaper so I cant write from scratch


[08/06/2021 10:51 PM] Marty#4039
but my hashrate are coming up as PH instead of MH


[08/06/2021 10:51 PM] Marty#4039
not sure if it's just an issue with math.pow


[08/06/2021 10:51 PM] Marty#4039
`blake: {
        multiplier: Math.pow(2, 8),
        hash: function(){
            return function(){
                return multiHashing.blake.apply(this, arguments);
            }
        }
    },`


[08/06/2021 10:51 PM] Marty#4039
or if it's got to do with the API in NOMP


[08/06/2021 10:52 PM] Jerry_slush#5579
i pmed you


[08/06/2021 10:53 PM] Marty#4039
does this hashrate look normal before it's been changed?


[08/06/2021 10:53 PM] Marty#4039
`{"hashrate":4128872857600000,"workerCount":1,"blocks":{"pending":134,"confirmed":0,"orphaned":0}`


[08/06/2021 10:53 PM] Marty#4039
like before i run it through the hashrate to readable string function


[08/06/2021 11:11 PM] Marty#4039
anyone using nomp, here's the line in stats.js


[08/06/2021 11:11 PM] Marty#4039
`var shareMultiplier = Math.pow(2, 8) / algos[coinStats.algorithm].multiplier;`


[08/06/2021 11:11 PM] Marty#4039
line 210. It was set math.pow(2, 32)


[08/06/2021 11:14 PM] Marty#4039
could probably rewrite it cleanly to be ergo specific but this hack works


[08/07/2021 7:12 AM] BuzzLiteBeer#8676
@ProSavage Hey I know you are super busy, but do you know anything about solo mining off of your own node rather than using a pools solo mining option?


[08/07/2021 7:14 AM] ProSavage#7131
Yes


[08/07/2021 7:14 AM] ProSavage#7131
All u need to do is mine the actual block so a share represents a block right


[08/07/2021 7:15 AM] ProSavage#7131
And if u find a nonce thay is valid for a block post it to the endpoint for submission


[08/07/2021 7:23 AM] BuzzLiteBeer#8676
Hmm, ive got some research to do to make that easy to do for a guide. Any resources you can direct me to?


[08/07/2021 10:09 AM] neal#4344
@ProSavage hi, our pool's orphan rate is pretty hight(around 5%). And I found our pool submit a solution for some block even 2s earlier than nanopool, but still turned out to be an orphan block. How is that possible?


[08/07/2021 10:22 AM] andee#4722
@neal from what I have seen other pools are far away from 5%


[08/07/2021 10:25 AM] andee#4722
but people are investigating the issue


[08/07/2021 10:25 AM] neal#4344
@andee far away from 5% means greater  or smaller?


[08/07/2021 10:26 AM] andee#4722
if I remember correctly other pools has less orphans, or not reporting having the problem


[08/07/2021 10:27 AM] andee#4722
`- Pools: continuous support. the 666 pool has an issue with orphan blocks, I'm working on it. it seems to me that we have some greedy miners (selfish mining attack).`


[08/07/2021 10:28 AM] neal#4344
yes, that what I suspecting. So I come to ask the data of other pool


[08/07/2021 10:28 AM] neal#4344
I think there is no reason for us to get a orphan block even if we found the solution 2s before other pool


[08/07/2021 10:29 AM] andee#4722
I just asked wooly if they get many orphans


[08/07/2021 10:29 AM] andee#4722
coinfoundry had 5 rejected blocks in a row, but I don't think that's the same as orphaned blocks?


[08/07/2021 10:29 AM] neal#4344
thanks a lot.


[08/07/2021 10:30 AM] neal#4344
rejected for what?


[08/07/2021 10:30 AM] neal#4344
Our pool's orphan rate is close to 0% until some day abount 2 months ago


[08/07/2021 10:30 AM] andee#4722
he didn't say anything else than that they were rejected, and he has not been available since


[08/07/2021 10:30 AM] neal#4344
before that every thing is fine


[08/07/2021 10:31 AM] neal#4344
@andee please help us out. The orphan blocks make us lost a lot


[08/07/2021 10:45 AM] andee#4722
wooly has 0% orphan rate


[08/07/2021 10:48 AM] neal#4344
Can you connect to some smaller pool?


[08/07/2021 10:49 AM] andee#4722
I can try asking coinfoundry


[08/07/2021 10:49 AM] neal#4344
thanks andee


[08/07/2021 10:51 AM] andee#4722
I haven't seen enigma report any orphans yet


[08/07/2021 10:52 AM] neal#4344
so I guess our orphan blocks have nothing to do with selfish mining? since other pool's orphan rate is 0%


[08/07/2021 10:52 AM] neal#4344
Do you have any suggestion on how to improve our orphan rate?


[08/07/2021 10:53 AM] neal#4344
üò´


[08/07/2021 10:56 AM] andee#4722
not really. could it be ISP/network related?


[08/07/2021 10:58 AM] neal#4344
can you be more specific? Do ergo have some public node? a


[08/07/2021 10:59 AM] neal#4344
Maybe I can test our node's network latency with it?


[08/07/2021 11:00 AM] neal#4344
Our another node can receive our broadcast in time


[08/07/2021 11:04 AM] andee#4722
if you check mainnet.conf in the node source you will find the IP of some nodes. I think the IP addresses of the nodes you are connected to is output in the node log too?


[08/07/2021 11:09 AM] neal#4344
thanks!


[08/07/2021 11:22 AM] neal#4344
@andee could you give us the newest node list? some node of our conf is not available anymore. Maybe we should update our mainnet conf


[08/07/2021 11:41 AM] andee#4722
the node should add peers automatically


[08/07/2021 11:54 AM] neal#4344
üò´ so what is the realy problem problem?


[08/07/2021 12:09 PM] Marty#4039
How long does a block normally wait for confirmation


[08/07/2021 12:09 PM] Marty#4039
I mined one at 2pm PST and still not conf


[08/07/2021 12:09 PM] Marty#4039
Wooly


[08/07/2021 12:10 PM] Marty#4039
Is that normal or maybe related to what @neal is talking abt


[08/07/2021 1:22 PM] Nythain#6769
720 confirmations, ~24hrs at a 120 sec block time but varies


[08/07/2021 1:32 PM] Marty#4039
Thank you


[08/07/2021 1:33 PM] Marty#4039
Did you get that info from experimentation or is it posted on the wiki


[08/07/2021 1:41 PM] Nythain#6769
I cant remember which paper its in, possibly the emission essay or autolykos paper? Pretty well known amongst us miners though.


[08/07/2021 1:42 PM] andee#4722
@Marty please use #‚ùì‚îÇmining-support for these kind of questions


[08/07/2021 1:49 PM] andee#4722
@herominers.com hey, do you get many orphaned blocks?


[08/07/2021 2:33 PM] ProSavage#7131
No orphan here I think


[08/07/2021 3:17 PM] venoox#1937
is stratum proxy necessary for hosting a pool?


[08/07/2021 3:20 PM] Nythain#6769
I dont think so anymore. It was mostly used to translate protocols between server and miner software. Think all main miners support natively now. Anyone else feel free to chime in if im wrong.


[08/07/2021 3:23 PM] venoox#1937
I think you're right. If I understand correctly Stratum proxy gets jobs from Stratum server aka pool and sends a http request to the mining software but now all miners support Stratum


[08/07/2021 3:26 PM] venoox#1937
I'm curious if anyone knows about extraNonce? My understanding is that stratum server decides first x bytes of the nonce for each worker and the worker randomly selects the other part of the nonce over and over until it finds a solution. I'm not sure if this is applicable to Ergo too?


[08/07/2021 3:49 PM] danik#0427
hello, where i can find example/tutorial how to host own pool ?


[08/07/2021 3:53 PM] Nythain#6769
I am pretty sure still applicable. Might be a while before proper response cause the only pool operator i know on herd who would answer is on vacation atm so im avoiding pinging lol


[08/07/2021 3:55 PM] venoox#1937
not many pool operators in here üòÑ


[08/07/2021 3:55 PM] Nythain#6769
Atm, there isnt any singular sourcd of info/guide. Some are being worked on but for now its a LOT of google and even more questions here lol


[08/07/2021 3:56 PM] danik#0427
ok thanks, i started ergo node and set miner = true what i should do more ? üòÑ


[08/07/2021 3:57 PM] Nythain#6769
Coinfoundry dev went silent a while ago, hero doesnt really interact much unless theres an issue to be sorted, most active dev is on holiday. Alex of woolypooly hangs on his own pools server but hasnt been know to answer setup questions. Those who run pools keep the info close, dont want to give away money lol


[08/07/2021 3:58 PM] Nythain#6769
For a pool, you will need a stratum server, some form of backend to database and process stuff, then a front end ui for miners to enjoy. And lots of patience and research


[08/07/2021 3:59 PM] venoox#1937
yeah mining pools are very closed and secretive and I don't really blame them but it's hard to find info about anything


[08/07/2021 4:00 PM] Nythain#6769
Thus the birth of this channel. Also, while not erg specific theres a good groop of people and devs on the ascidpool discord


[08/07/2021 4:03 PM] danik#0427
thanks i will try with stratum server first


[08/07/2021 9:35 PM] BuzzLiteBeer#8676
Did you mean to say node rather than nonce?


[08/07/2021 9:41 PM] Nythain#6769
No, they meant nonce


[08/08/2021 2:40 AM] CryptoMinerOS#1745
I saw this link that someone posted before. It is a nomp implementation for ergo  https://github.com/btclinux/ergo-nomp

If you havent tried setting up a pool before then you need a lot of reading.

Basically what you need is.

1. Running daemon
2. Frontend, in this case this is NOMP
3. Stratum server. https://github.com/mhssamadani/ErgoStratumServer (NOMP uses this)
4. Redis server (DB for your pool)
5. Server to host your pool
6. Patience

Pretty short list. Code is written in NodeJS so you should need a little bit of knowledge in JS

Yeah, posted that a while ago myself. Takes a bit of hackery too, not as bad as building from scratch or trying to hammer at stock nomp but i believe at least the payment system is borked. A good start though, thanks for the links :)


[08/08/2021 5:26 PM] Marty#4039
We are working with ergonomp ourselves


[08/08/2021 5:26 PM] Marty#4039
currently on testnet we are mining blocks, but they don't confirm


[08/08/2021 5:26 PM] Marty#4039
"blocks":{"pending":576,"confirmed":0,"orphaned":0}


[08/08/2021 5:26 PM] Marty#4039
this is over a few days time


[08/08/2021 5:27 PM] Marty#4039
Has anyone fixed the payment system and is willing to share anything?


[08/08/2021 5:28 PM] Marty#4039
it shows blocks are pending but the test-erg do seem to show up in the node wallet

I am using the port in the .json file and the command line to run the miner


[08/09/2021 7:01 AM] venoox#1937
I can see that you're using HTTP. Stratum protocol is based on plain TCP with JSON-RPC


[08/09/2021 7:01 AM] BuzzLiteBeer#8676
Hey thanks for the response, I was able to resolve it!


[08/09/2021 7:01 AM] BuzzLiteBeer#8676
Happily solo mining now


[08/09/2021 7:01 AM] venoox#1937
Good!


[08/09/2021 7:05 AM] venoox#1937
Do you maybe know why time is empty? I was also debugging communication between my miner and a pool and I found that miner always sends time as "00000000". My understanding is that timestamp is included in the block header so it can change the hash so shouldn't it be important to send?


[08/09/2021 8:54 AM] CryptoMinerOS#1745
`Note that Ergo node generates the candidate block and this process cannot be outsourced to miners.`

Time is empty because only the node can generate the candidate block. What the miner need is just the msg the target and extra nonce.


[08/09/2021 10:30 AM] venoox#1937
I thought it means only for transactions part, thank you!


[08/09/2021 6:04 PM] Marty#4039
Anyone who's wrote their own payment processor code, can you direct me to some resources you liked that might help us work that out? We are likely going to either start from scratch or seriously alter the code in nomp at this poiunt


[08/09/2021 6:09 PM] andee#4722
I doubt that you will find any guide to this. study the code of other mining portal softwares or just break it down to what needs to be done and start implementing it piece by piece


[08/09/2021 6:18 PM] Marty#4039
about to dive into mining core. good tip, thanks


[08/09/2021 6:36 PM] Nythain#6769
i know Pro is about to start working on that part of enigma pool when he gets back from vacation. he's being super duper careful though because yeah, money, and until then just manually processing payouts. might want to pick his brain a little bit when he gets back, maybe he can offer some starting points.


[08/09/2021 10:00 PM] Marty#4039
he's doing it manually? damn that seems like a lot of work


[08/09/2021 10:00 PM] Marty#4039
will definitely chat with him


[08/09/2021 10:07 PM] Nythain#6769

@Shmocs [MinerPool.Pro - UTC+2] block reward is paid and the "change" is sent back as a new UTxO


[08/09/2021 10:39 PM] Shmocs [MinerPool.Pro - UTC+2]#1564
hmm


[08/09/2021 10:39 PM] Shmocs [MinerPool.Pro - UTC+2]#1564
so it's not similar to usual PoW coins that mint the full block reward as a new/fresh coinbase ?


[08/09/2021 10:41 PM] Shmocs [MinerPool.Pro - UTC+2]#1564
in order to have a UTxO .. the tx has to leave from a previous wallet having funds... so where is the mining/coinbase process happening ?


[08/09/2021 10:44 PM] Shmocs [MinerPool.Pro - UTC+2]#1564
reading the docs/ErgoScript.pdf ...


[08/09/2021 10:48 PM] andee#4722
I'm sure you will find it there. search for emission box if you don't find anything there. its basically a box containing all the ERG left which is destroyed and recreated for each block


[08/09/2021 10:49 PM] Shmocs [MinerPool.Pro - UTC+2]#1564

node seems to not get synced üò¶


[08/10/2021 9:38 AM] andee#4722
have you tried deleting the .ergo folder?


[08/10/2021 9:39 AM] andee#4722
and there is no need to run the node as root, did you run it as root first and then try to run it as the ergo user?


[08/10/2021 11:34 AM] Shmocs [MinerPool.Pro - UTC+2]#1564
no root


[08/10/2021 11:34 AM] Shmocs [MinerPool.Pro - UTC+2]#1564
it runs as it is designed to run in that docker container


[08/10/2021 11:35 AM] Shmocs [MinerPool.Pro - UTC+2]#1564
the mounted volume for .ergo folder is indeed owned by the host root user, maybe this is an issue


[08/10/2021 11:36 AM] Shmocs [MinerPool.Pro - UTC+2]#1564
but i should have seen it complaining about write permissions or something in the log ...


[08/10/2021 12:31 PM] Shmocs [MinerPool.Pro - UTC+2]#1564
yep, that was the issue üôÇ

i chown-ed .ergo folder to 9052.9052 in host and all good now


[08/10/2021 1:39 PM] andee#4722
if there is a problem with permissions it will show up when you start the node, before it starts outputting connections etc.


[08/10/2021 1:41 PM] andee#4722

[08/10/2021 5:07 PM] Shmocs [MinerPool.Pro - UTC+2]#1564
or everything is done just using those RPC calls ?


[08/10/2021 5:09 PM] andee#4722
I don't know of any tool. I just made a bash script with the stuff I needed


[08/10/2021 5:17 PM] Shmocs [MinerPool.Pro - UTC+2]#1564
and the basic actor in that script is `curl` ?


[08/10/2021 5:17 PM] Shmocs [MinerPool.Pro - UTC+2]#1564
i suppose yes... if no other cli is available


[08/10/2021 5:18 PM] Shmocs [MinerPool.Pro - UTC+2]#1564
i also have many helper scripts.. as along the years i needed wallets to be swiped (zcashy coins) as they got piggy because of zs/zc addresses/witness/...


[08/10/2021 5:19 PM] Shmocs [MinerPool.Pro - UTC+2]#1564
but they all used -cli binaries of the coins


[08/10/2021 5:19 PM] Shmocs [MinerPool.Pro - UTC+2]#1564
i will adapt them .. not a problem üôÇ


[08/10/2021 5:21 PM] andee#4722
you can use whatever that can do a http post/get

true


[08/10/2021 6:42 PM] andee#4722
I prefer curl, but your for your use case maybe its better to use python instead of bash. I had low requirements for parsing the response


[08/10/2021 8:25 PM] Shmocs [MinerPool.Pro - UTC+2]#1564
i am more comfortable with bash scripting.. so i will stick to it üôÇ


[08/10/2021 8:58 PM] Marty#4039
Does the s-nomp version you're using have a better payment processor script that needs less work for ergo?


[08/10/2021 9:35 PM] Shmocs [MinerPool.Pro - UTC+2]#1564
i will see when i get there...


[08/11/2021 6:48 AM] andee#4722
probably easier to just write a separate script for payment processing and use systemd or cron to run it x times a day

this seems like a silly question, but if I have a pool with 2 servers, should the modes use the same api keys/wallets? or should the nodes use separate?


[08/12/2021 9:31 AM] andee#4722
considering the pools seem to have 1 address associated with their pool, my guess is that they use the same and that api key could be different for each node

whats the difference beetwen mining on herominers or nanopool, 2miners, and mining for example on leafpool or enigmapool? is it better to connect to a big pool like herominers or nanopool, or its a good option leave them and join to leafpool or enigmapool?


[08/18/2021 1:48 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
@Serotonina the larger pools give you the lower round contribution which means you will recieve a lower share of each block mined.


[08/18/2021 1:50 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Its best to go for a balance of round contribution, low latency, and high payout frequecy


[08/18/2021 1:54 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Its also good to consider the pool's tax


[08/18/2021 2:01 AM] Serotonina#2676
most of the pools fees r 1%-0.9%


[08/18/2021 2:02 AM] Serotonina#2676
whitch pool u recommend with that characteristics?


[08/18/2021 2:04 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
I mine with herominers 2miners is also good but my ping with them was too high


[08/18/2021 2:05 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
You should look at ping first then mine with the ones that look interesting for a day or two and watch/compare your profit over 24 hours


[08/18/2021 2:07 AM] Serotonina#2676
im on herominers rn, but i was thinking to try leafpool, with 0% of fee for now, but im not sure, i use USA server on herominers, and on leafpool will be the same, USA server


[08/18/2021 2:08 AM] Serotonina#2676
leafpool looks good, but its still a little pool compared with herominers or nanopool, i like the web design of leafpool, so clean


[08/18/2021 2:12 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
I normally find ping when i mine. The shares submitted will show on most miners


[08/18/2021 2:12 AM] Serotonina#2676
how do i look the ping that i have on a pool?


[08/18/2021 2:13 AM] Serotonina#2676

100 ms


[08/18/2021 2:14 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Not terrible


[08/18/2021 2:16 AM] Serotonina#2676
i do weekly payouts from herominers, depending on the mining difficulty i receive diffent amounts of ERGO, on leafpool for example how much time ill do to get 6 ERG, for example


[08/18/2021 2:19 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Well i cant recommend which one will be better. Your situation with mining will be very different from mine. I can only give a strategy eliminating pools


[08/18/2021 2:19 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Or atleast wha ive learned


[08/18/2021 2:20 AM] Serotonina#2676
k ill keep in mind


[08/18/2021 2:21 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Ive never mined with small pools btw. Only with pools slightly smaller than the top pool


[08/18/2021 2:22 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
So getting the data for them i cant say exactly if it will be better.


[08/18/2021 2:23 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Most of this will be on luck. You could get paid the 6 ergo within a hour or even a month


[08/18/2021 5:50 PM] Marty#4039
Is this a good idea? Use one node to pay miners and another node to submit blocks?


[08/18/2021 6:40 PM] ProSavage#7131
I guess if wallet is the same?


[08/18/2021 6:41 PM] ProSavage#7131
I need to figure out if I can use the same node address on multiple machines


[08/18/2021 6:41 PM] Marty#4039
I thought it would be fine to just use one node


[08/18/2021 6:41 PM] ProSavage#7131
I use a single node


[08/18/2021 6:41 PM] Marty#4039
You'd like to have redundancy? I haven't solved that problem yet either


[08/18/2021 6:41 PM] ProSavage#7131
yes Id like to write my code in a way where we hit the local node


[08/18/2021 6:41 PM] Marty#4039
Maybe k8s is a good solution, though they've deprecated docker


[08/18/2021 6:41 PM] ProSavage#7131
yeah idk why they depcreate docker


[08/18/2021 6:42 PM] ProSavage#7131
Ive already got containers working


[08/18/2021 6:42 PM] ProSavage#7131
my whole arch is containerized


[08/18/2021 6:42 PM] Marty#4039
I haven't searched for a clustering solution that works with docker yet, but maybe there's something out there


[08/18/2021 6:43 PM] Marty#4039
Our whole thing is containers too


[08/18/2021 6:44 PM] Marty#4039
You could run a diff node at each server locale, then send any mining rewards to one lead node which makes payments


[08/18/2021 6:45 PM] Marty#4039
It could access the databases of each mining server to see who needs payments, but each server's local node could be submitting blocks and sending work to miners


[08/18/2021 6:45 PM] Marty#4039
Did you write the whole thing in JavaScript? What database did you use?


[08/18/2021 7:01 PM] ProSavage#7131
yes nodejs typescript


[08/18/2021 7:01 PM] ProSavage#7131
I use redis and mongodb


[08/18/2021 7:02 PM] ProSavage#7131
I already do what u said except the ergo node is central


[08/18/2021 7:02 PM] ProSavage#7131
I run stratum servers + share processor worker on each region


[08/18/2021 7:05 PM] andee#4722
you can probably do so, but its probably not a bad idea to use a separate node for payments so submission of blocks and generation of block candidates goes smooth


[08/18/2021 7:05 PM] andee#4722
https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/issues/1346


[08/18/2021 7:06 PM] andee#4722
seems like parallel calls can be disruptive


[08/18/2021 7:06 PM] ProSavage#7131
I mean probably not bad idea since as long as u dont submit


[08/18/2021 7:06 PM] ProSavage#7131
u dont have to worry


[08/18/2021 7:06 PM] ProSavage#7131
yeah we're loading our single node pretty hard


[08/18/2021 7:08 PM] andee#4722
and there is nothing stopping you from running the same wallet on different nodes savage. are you connecting different regions to a central node?


[08/18/2021 7:10 PM] ProSavage#7131
yeah and I do not want to do this


[08/18/2021 7:10 PM] ProSavage#7131
should I just use the same memonic


[08/18/2021 7:10 PM] ProSavage#7131
I tried that at once point and it just *didnt* recover it


[08/18/2021 7:10 PM] ProSavage#7131
gave me anew wallet :kekw:


[08/18/2021 7:11 PM] andee#4722
try firing up a VM for testing, if your seed is correct it should give you the same wallet


[08/18/2021 7:12 PM] andee#4722
you could try copying the wallet folder, but I would be a little worried if restoring from mnemonic isn't giving you the same wallet


[08/18/2021 7:13 PM] andee#4722
have you tried `‚Äã/wallet‚Äã/check` ?


[08/18/2021 7:53 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I haven't gotten as far as Savage, but I have used 2 different nodes: 1 for stratum, 1 for payments on same wallet and it works fine


[08/20/2021 9:16 AM] K1pool.com | Pool Admin#0177
Any Ergo dev admin is here ? Need to talk about pool.


[08/20/2021 3:05 PM] ProSavage#7131
Your question literally conveys that you are too lazy to ask your question unless an all powerful entity appears who can guarantee they can answer your question.

You should just ask the question, there aree a couple of "pool dev"s in here along with some people who just might know the answer to your question without being a pool dev.
It's better to just ask and if someone knows the answer they will tell you.

Im a pool dev and I check this server once a day, I might've been able to answer the question if you had *actually* asked it.


[08/20/2021 3:08 PM] ProSavage#7131
See you tomorrow


[08/20/2021 3:11 PM] andee#4722
what progress have you made? are you working on modifying nomp?


[08/20/2021 3:24 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
Yes, the hope is to get a working solution and go live possibly move from testnet to mainnet this weekend and then continue to work on improving the solution ongoing.  I have rewritten the payout system, and a some supporting API calls, and @Marty has done a great job with the website.


[08/20/2021 3:36 PM] ProSavage#7131
What‚Äôs ur site lookin like?


[08/20/2021 4:52 PM] Marty#4039
Tulipfarm.one


[08/20/2021 4:53 PM] Marty#4039
I have a few more data points to add from an API Leif has been working on. Its getting close


[08/20/2021 4:53 PM] Marty#4039
Nomp was missing a lot. Leif wrote a whole payment processing script and new API on top of it


[08/20/2021 5:03 PM] GaryMcNeish#5547
are there any open source pool front ends any one knows of that work with ergo


[08/20/2021 5:04 PM] GaryMcNeish#5547
I managed to get the local node working with trex and nvminer if anyone needs any help I can assist


[08/20/2021 6:02 PM] venoox#1937
does anyone know how to convert from difficulty to target and vice versa?


[08/20/2021 6:31 PM] venoox#1937
or maybe what's the max target then I can calculate the rest


[08/20/2021 9:08 PM] ProSavage#7131
Yes it‚Äôs inverse


[08/20/2021 9:09 PM] ProSavage#7131
Diff is really just a miner friendly value


[08/20/2021 9:11 PM] venoox#1937
max target should be difficulty 1 right?


[08/20/2021 9:14 PM] Marty#4039
are you writing a vardiff service @venoox ?


[08/20/2021 9:14 PM] ProSavage#7131
Service??


[08/20/2021 9:14 PM] ProSavage#7131
Yes


[08/20/2021 9:14 PM] Marty#4039
uh like.. little applet


[08/20/2021 9:14 PM] ProSavage#7131
Why would it be an applet


[08/20/2021 9:14 PM] Marty#4039
i'm using the wrong term


[08/20/2021 9:14 PM] ProSavage#7131
Would need to be integrated into a stratum


[08/20/2021 9:14 PM] venoox#1937
he probably means a module


[08/20/2021 9:14 PM] Marty#4039
module yes


[08/20/2021 9:15 PM] venoox#1937
yeah I'm writing a stratum pool in Go


[08/20/2021 9:15 PM] venoox#1937
including vardiff


[08/20/2021 9:15 PM] Marty#4039
oh, nice


[08/20/2021 9:15 PM] ProSavage#7131
Hot


[08/20/2021 9:15 PM] ProSavage#7131
I have my pool up but I need to write vardiff still


[08/20/2021 9:15 PM] venoox#1937
Go is really good for that kind of stuff, simple and fast


[08/20/2021 9:15 PM] ProSavage#7131
Other more pressing things to fix first


[08/20/2021 9:15 PM] Marty#4039
open source?


[08/20/2021 9:16 PM] venoox#1937
probably


[08/20/2021 9:16 PM] Marty#4039
let us know when you launch it


[08/20/2021 9:16 PM] ProSavage#7131
I follow Wolfys philosophy

Yea


[08/20/2021 9:17 PM] ProSavage#7131
I did mine but never wrote it down lol


[08/20/2021 9:17 PM] ProSavage#7131
I just have the knowledge in my head and still need to write it down


[08/20/2021 9:17 PM] venoox#1937
yeah I have to remind myself to write it xD


[08/20/2021 9:18 PM] ProSavage#7131
I learned a LITTLE bit of go


[08/20/2021 9:18 PM] ProSavage#7131
But I‚Äôm pretty interested in language


[08/20/2021 9:18 PM] ProSavage#7131
I ended up using JavaScript since I‚Äôm good at it


[08/20/2021 9:18 PM] ProSavage#7131
Didn‚Äôt wanna learn go and pool concepts at same time


[08/20/2021 9:18 PM] ProSavage#7131
I want to use either go or rust eventually


[08/20/2021 9:19 PM] venoox#1937
I wanted to write in Javascript first and then later in Go but I just decided to use Go from the start


[08/20/2021 9:19 PM] ProSavage#7131
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing


[08/20/2021 9:19 PM] ProSavage#7131
What u just said


[08/20/2021 9:19 PM] ProSavage#7131
I did the JavaScript already


[08/20/2021 9:19 PM] ProSavage#7131
Need to port to Go once I have time


[08/20/2021 9:19 PM] ProSavage#7131
So are u planning on starting a pool or what


[08/20/2021 9:19 PM] venoox#1937
I would use Rust but it would take too much time


[08/20/2021 9:20 PM] ProSavage#7131
Someone told me once it all clicks rust isn‚Äôt gonna take *that* long


[08/20/2021 9:20 PM] venoox#1937
probably just a mini pool if anyone is interested in using it


[08/20/2021 9:20 PM] venoox#1937
just wanna learn pools in general


[08/20/2021 9:21 PM] ProSavage#7131
It‚Äôs pretty cool


[08/20/2021 9:22 PM] ProSavage#7131
Just don‚Äôt get stuck being a maintainer who gets nothing out of it is all I want to say


[08/20/2021 9:22 PM] ProSavage#7131
I‚Äôve done that countless times for years on projects


[08/20/2021 9:22 PM] ProSavage#7131
I‚Äôll make a software and everyone makes money off of it and I get next to nothing back.


[08/20/2021 9:22 PM] venoox#1937
yeah being a maintainer for free is no fun


[08/20/2021 9:23 PM] ProSavage#7131
It‚Äôs fun for a bit


[08/20/2021 9:23 PM] ProSavage#7131
Lol


[08/20/2021 9:23 PM] venoox#1937
yeah until people come screaming at you to fix something xD


[08/20/2021 9:23 PM] ProSavage#7131
Yes exactly


[08/20/2021 9:23 PM] ProSavage#7131
Like MIT that shit once ur done and call it a day lolol


[08/23/2021 5:20 PM] andee#4722
any new pools making progress?


[08/23/2021 5:29 PM] Nythain#6769
good question.


[08/23/2021 5:30 PM] andee#4722
I know there has been two or three people saying they are working on pools, but never saw them active here


[08/23/2021 7:01 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
@Marty and I are close to releasing...just trying to get something going and continue to improve ongoing


[08/23/2021 7:02 PM] Marty#4039
It works, we're just finishing up a few API calls that the website dashboard needs before we switch off testnet


[08/23/2021 7:06 PM] andee#4722
@Leif Erickson did you end up modifying nomp or just doing a separate script for payments?


[08/23/2021 7:14 PM] andee#4722
do you have much hashrate to boostrap the pool with?


[08/23/2021 10:48 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I'm modified nomp a bit, although some of the changes I made early on were updated in nomp by someone

this pool run this software


[08/24/2021 3:54 AM] ProSavage#7131
as long as you're familiar with c# and .net


[08/24/2021 3:54 AM] ProSavage#7131
you need to modify the code to support ergo üôÇ


[08/24/2021 3:54 AM] ProSavage#7131
I considered this, and ended up just going full custom


[08/24/2021 3:54 AM] ProSavage#7131
since understanding the code was gonna take forever ( I really didnt know much about mining )


[08/24/2021 3:57 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389

https://enigmapool.com


[08/24/2021 4:11 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Well, i don't need to get a pool up right now. I can spend some free time on development.


[08/24/2021 4:12 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
And nice i just started mining on enigma today


[08/24/2021 4:12 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
I should be able to add 1ghs soon


[08/24/2021 4:13 AM] ProSavage#7131
that's cool.

Atleast at first, you need to spend a helluva lot of time on it


[08/24/2021 4:13 AM] ProSavage#7131
Im working on a goal of 1 feature a day right now


[08/24/2021 4:13 AM] ProSavage#7131
some features take a while, so more of "1 thing a day"


[08/24/2021 4:15 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Nice my main goal right now is to expand my farm and move it to an office space. Another is to integrate prometheus and grafana.


[08/24/2021 4:15 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Mostly even if i don't get the pool to run i can atleast get into programming and scrypting


[08/24/2021 4:25 AM] ProSavage#7131
we're looking into grafana and prom for our pool software right now


[08/24/2021 4:34 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Nice im trying to integrate them into my worker. Ive seen a few people do this. And it looks great


[08/24/2021 4:35 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Better pull of data than what i get right now


[08/24/2021 1:54 PM] .Lily#8358
is there any point in creating a pool


[08/24/2021 1:54 PM] .Lily#8358
instead of just mining into one


[08/24/2021 1:54 PM] .Lily#8358
:SenkoThinking:


[08/24/2021 2:19 PM] Nythain#6769
depends on if you charge a fee üôÇ but also there's some people out there who don't have the setup to efficiently mine, and can more easily just create and host something


[08/24/2021 9:19 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
@ProSavageany miners other than NBMiner that you know work with the pool?


[08/24/2021 9:19 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
I tried t-rex and lolminer and both dont register on the page


[08/24/2021 9:19 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
I can connect but the server wont show the worker


[08/24/2021 9:23 PM] ProSavage#7131
with my pool or with the open source one lol


[08/24/2021 9:23 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
enigmapool


[08/24/2021 9:24 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
NBMiner runs a bit to hot for my cards with a higher wattage and gives lower hash on each card


[08/24/2021 9:25 PM] andee#4722
sounds like a config error on your side


[08/24/2021 9:26 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
could be. i cant make the config files since im using Hiveos.


[08/24/2021 9:27 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
well i could i would have to launch from the consol not the server


[08/24/2021 9:27 PM] andee#4722
you do, by configuring the miner settings on the flightsheet


[08/24/2021 9:27 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
i've been doing that. i can get NBMiner to work but none of the others


[08/24/2021 9:28 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
and the miners connect and can send shares but the pool isnt picking anything up

the wallet and worker tempalte is cut off for me there


[08/24/2021 9:32 PM] ProSavage#7131
u can try doing nothing in workername maybe


[08/24/2021 9:32 PM] ProSavage#7131
and put it in wallet and worker


[08/24/2021 9:32 PM] ProSavage#7131
like


[08/24/2021 9:32 PM] ProSavage#7131
%WAL%.%WORKER_NAME% or whatever


[08/24/2021 9:32 PM] ProSavage#7131

no space


[08/24/2021 9:34 PM] andee#4722
no space is what every miner uses though


[08/24/2021 9:35 PM] andee#4722
`%WAL%.%WORKER_NAME%` as savage wrote is what you should use on hive


[08/24/2021 9:39 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
it was probably ignored and the server added the worker name in the next box

I can send a screenshot


[08/30/2021 12:14 AM] ProSavage#7131
yes this is because people did not set a wallet

If anyone has some hashrate to send our way, we've launched tulipfarm.one

Stratum server is tulipfarm.one:8008


[09/01/2021 7:50 AM] Marty#4039
Finishing up the website over the next few days. We'll also release a link to the GitHub repo..it's a hack of nomp, with some Python additions for payment processing. Eventually will be writing a stratum server in python as well


[09/01/2021 3:00 PM] Nythain#6769
that's awesome news. sadly no hashpower to contribute atm though.


[09/01/2021 7:49 PM] Marty#4039
all good! We have a few GH so far, and I'm sure it will grow as I improve the website


[09/01/2021 7:49 PM] Marty#4039
I'm not marketing hard yet, since I think there's some areas that need a bit more work. You can't change your min payout yet, the how-to page is pretty lackluster. It'll come with time


[09/01/2021 7:51 PM] Marty#4039
@Leif Erickson will be working on some of the back-end stuff as well. We have a github too if you'd like to take a look. The payment processing is done with python

[09/04/2021 4:33 PM] Marty#4039
Very cool! Right now our mine has a prop payment system so that's actually better for part-time miners


[09/04/2021 6:36 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
Is there a way to reduce messaging on node?  Or perhaps I'm not current with charges for traffic.  The one thing with starting TulipFarm.one and remote servers is that the traffic will bump my AWS EC2 instance in to the charge are...since not making money right now, hoping to minize charges...which of course may cost some folks to move on...the constant issue of, "takes money to make money" lol


[09/04/2021 6:38 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
btw, if anyone knows of someone or wants to fund some world node/stratum servers so we can give tulipfarm.one longer arms, let's talk!!


[09/04/2021 6:45 PM] andee#4722
what messaging are you thinking of? hard to slim down the stratum communication


[09/04/2021 6:49 PM] andee#4722
if you are only running one node and proxying via the regions, run the nodes on all regions. if you don't run nodes on every region there is no point in having them anyway


[09/04/2021 6:56 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
ya, stratum communication prob only cut down slightly by changing pool difficulty, but I was thinking of the node messaging.  I would want nodes in each region to reduce the latency between it and stratum


[09/04/2021 7:03 PM] andee#4722
are you using vardiff? big rigs on low diff can cause lots of traffic. is it the nodes communication with the network you want to reduce?


[09/04/2021 7:13 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
that makes sense, I just am not seeing where nomp is compensating for adjusting the difficulty by proportioinally adjusting the shares


[09/04/2021 7:13 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I'm also working to build a pplns system so I need to rewrite nomps share tracker in redis anyway


[09/04/2021 7:15 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
...I may be able to get difficulty from the pool stats...it's just timestamped so I'm not sure it correlates directly with share submissions


[09/04/2021 7:18 PM] andee#4722
how are you expecting it to compensate? it should result in fewer shares with higher diff, isn't this stored in the database?


[09/04/2021 7:19 PM] andee#4722
if not each individual share and diff is stored, I would at least expect a share count + total diff of shares to be there


[09/04/2021 7:24 PM] Marty#4039
Does it normally store shares with a difficulty value? My assumption was a share mined at 10x difficulty would just add 10x the shares to the database


[09/04/2021 7:25 PM] Marty#4039
It works either way, just depends how your payments are calculating it


[09/04/2021 7:38 PM] andee#4722
then it would be very hard to display correct share stats


[09/04/2021 7:39 PM] andee#4722
the easiest way would be to store share count and total diff of shares


[09/04/2021 7:59 PM] Marty#4039
The shares just track a miner's contribution to the pool for the purpose of payouts, correct?


[09/04/2021 8:00 PM] Marty#4039
Meaning if I wanted to calculate a payout, it doesn't matter if the shares have difficulty attached, if somewhere else the pool just said a share of 2x difficulty is just added to the worker's database entry as 2 shares. Does that make sense?


[09/04/2021 8:02 PM] andee#4722
for me that sounds more complicated


[09/04/2021 8:03 PM] Marty#4039
Ok fair enough.


[09/04/2021 8:03 PM] andee#4722
if you track the miners total share diff and their shares in the windows its pretty easy to calculate


[09/04/2021 8:03 PM] Marty#4039
As long as the payout knows a share that's 2x the difficulty is worth 2x the payout


[09/04/2021 8:03 PM] Marty#4039
Yeah that's fine


[09/04/2021 8:03 PM] andee#4722
you can also use total share diff of all miners to calculate current effort and the blocks effort when it was found


[09/04/2021 8:03 PM] Marty#4039
Oh good point


[09/04/2021 8:07 PM] andee#4722
but for pplns one would need to keep track of this though. I haven't really studied how they do it, FIFO of x amount of shares?


[09/04/2021 8:16 PM] Marty#4039
Yes


[09/04/2021 8:17 PM] Marty#4039
That's my understanding


[09/04/2021 10:40 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I have a decent example now and playing with the numbers.  I am not sure I understand how the shareDiff is calculated, but the pool diff is setup at 4G (well, 3.999G) and this miner started there but now closer to 2G but the blockDiffActual is 1.15 `{

}`


[09/04/2021 10:41 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
the network difficulty at the time this share occured on testnet was 1267350896640


[09/04/2021 10:42 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I've started storing the current vardiff and the network difficulty at the time a share is generated, which is the only time that vardiff changes difficulty it looks to me (meaning only changes when a share is found, not in between)


[09/04/2021 10:44 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I just want to make sure that I'm fairly applying the right modifier to shares.  For example if someone is mining at 2G and another at 4G and they both find a share, does the 4G miner get 2x shares?  Or, is it relative to the overall network difficulty? Or, is it even a linear relationship?


[09/04/2021 10:44 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
...anyway, off to be brain dead for a bit! üòõ


[09/05/2021 6:45 PM] Marty#4039

I have had some problems with npm in a docker...try `docker exec -it ergostratum bash` and then `npm update` and if that doesn't help, delete node_modules and  `npm install` ... then `docker-compose restart ergostratum`


[09/12/2021 4:02 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
@bforemanl are you running this from docker-compose?


[09/12/2021 4:04 AM] bforemanl#8102
yes running from docker compose


[09/12/2021 4:04 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
it looks like the stratum server is failing on an npm dependency.  You also will get an error if your testnet or mainnet is not fully sync'd


[09/12/2021 4:05 AM] bforemanl#8102
okay


[09/12/2021 4:05 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
the cmd above (docker exec) basically puts you at the command prompt inside the docker container...so it needs to be running

Can anyone share some resources on setting difficulty for your own node? I've setup the node and stratum server but my miner hits so many shares that my server starts rejecting them for low difficulty.

How to host a pool o  ergo


[09/15/2021 5:48 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
In config? Vardiff?  I usually test around 4G and if testing vardiff I set at least 1G


[09/15/2021 2:27 PM] boomer#0823
Thanks for the reply. I'm looking for help setting up the diff/vardiff parameters in start.js. I just tried switching the maxdiff param to 4000000000 and it's showing a 4.91P difficulty. My config currently looks like: 
diff=1
vardiff={mindiff=.1 maxdiff=4000000000}

I'd expect the server to use the target times to start with a difficulty 1 and rip through a ton of shares until the next block. Then multiply the difficulty by b (I can't find where this is set) and continue that process until the difficulty reaches the target time for shares submitted. This is a different issue than I had yesterday but I'm looking more for resources on how to adjust these settings than someone telling me what numbers to use.


[09/15/2021 5:46 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
ah...I'm gonna tag @mhs_sam , but I solved this before latest stratum changes, and have continued to include this change around line 295 in the stratum.js file: `
        var params = [...jobParams]
        if(typeof params[6] !== 'string') {
            if (options.multiplyDifficulty) {
                var b = params[6].multipliedBy(this.difficulty);
                params[6] = b.toFixed(0);
            } else {
                params[6] = params[6].toFixed(0);
            }
        }
        params[6] = BigInt(Math.pow(2, 256)/_this.difficulty).toString()
        sendJson({
            id    : null,
            method: "mining.notify",
            params: params
        });`


[09/15/2021 5:48 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
...you can probably see that the entire if condition isn't really necessary, but I included just kept it in my last revision.


[09/17/2021 7:27 AM] Elemental#9509
Yo. By chance, does anyone know of any tutorials/videos out there showcasing "How to create an ERGO pool"?
If not.. would anyone be able to assist me with where to begin?


[09/17/2021 3:37 PM] boomer#0823
I just went through the process and while I can't say I've done everything, I can tell you that you need to go through the following:
1. https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Mining-Ergo-after-The-Hardening-Upgrade
2. https://github.com/mhssamadani/ErgoStratumServer (unless you just want to use the NV Miner)

[09/17/2021 7:24 PM] boomer#0823
In case anyone jumps in here after me, my problem was with t-rex miner not respecting the difficulty I set for it in the Stratum server in start.js. When I switched to NBMiner, it doesn't use the vardiff params but it at least lets me mine at the rate I set on the server. I'll probably dive into this a little further later on but wanted to close the loop on my own issue. Is anyone else having luck adjusting difficulty or using vardiff with trex?


[09/17/2021 10:10 PM] Elemental#9509
Noted. Thanks for this


[09/17/2021 10:11 PM] Marty#4039
vardiff is not functioning correctly on ergostratumserver


[09/17/2021 10:12 PM] Marty#4039
if someone jumps on that and creates a solution, please push to the repo


[09/17/2021 10:12 PM] Marty#4039
@Leif Erickson mentioned a temp fix he wrote, if you scroll up a bit


[09/17/2021 10:13 PM] Marty#4039
it maybe solves your problem entirely actually


[09/17/2021 10:19 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I haven't tested, but I pushed changes in to my GitHub until I can catch up with mhmsam, cause it seems to be a.pretty simple fix.


[09/17/2021 10:25 PM] boomer#0823
Now that I've gotten a much better understanding of what's expected with that function, I'll test it out and let you know my own results from Leif's changes. Thank you for your reply earlier!


[09/18/2021 1:10 AM] Elemental#9509
Yo. Out of curiosity, would you recommend testing this on my personal gaming pc? or should I get a VPS for this? Or alternately, should I set this up on a secondary pc?


[09/18/2021 1:11 AM] Marty#4039
you can run it locally


[09/18/2021 1:11 AM] Marty#4039
you don't need to open any ports on your firewall or router


[09/18/2021 1:12 AM] boomer#0823
I'm currently testing mine locally on a gaming PC


[09/18/2021 1:13 AM] Elemental#9509
is this safe though? Also, how would I go about connecting a non-numeric IP as the pool ip?
Example: instead of 123.0.0.1, i want the ip to be something like "ergopool.com"


[09/18/2021 1:13 AM] Elemental#9509
^


[09/18/2021 1:13 AM] Marty#4039
it's safe if you don't open the ports... and if you want to open the port to the stratum server, you can, but obviously leave the node port closed


[09/18/2021 1:14 AM] Marty#4039
if you want to use a URL like yoururl.com, you can use dyndns on linux


[09/18/2021 1:14 AM] Marty#4039
and setup an A+ record


[09/18/2021 1:15 AM] Elemental#9509
Honestly I kinda just really wish someone would just go ahead and make a step by step yt tutorial on this üòÇ


[09/18/2021 1:15 AM] Marty#4039
if you don't know these things, perhaps running a pool that handles people's money is not the best idea


[09/18/2021 1:16 AM] Marty#4039
but if you want to just get something going, first fire up a node and unlock the wallet, then run Leif's dockers

[09/18/2021 1:16 AM] boomer#0823
I would push you to keep trying so you continue to learn though! The guides are actually detailed enough if you take the time to go through them. üôÇ


[09/18/2021 1:17 AM] Marty#4039
there are good guides on how to run a node, and the documentation on the stratum server is very straightforward

[09/18/2021 1:39 AM] boomer#0823
Exactly! It's a great way to keep fresh or brush up on your skills while helping a great project.


[09/18/2021 1:49 AM] Elemental#9509
Hey @Marty out of curiosity. Would you recommend using these links as a guide for my pool or do you have any alternative githubs in mind?


[09/18/2021 1:51 AM] Marty#4039
yes get a full node running then use mhs_sam's stratum server


[09/18/2021 1:51 AM] boomer#0823
He mentioned the github from Leif a little earlier. (https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/854291931072561152/886444388769726485) I was looking at it today and it seems like @Leif Erickson has spent a lot of time building out some cool features on top of the bare-bones version of the Stratum server I linked to.


[09/18/2021 1:51 AM] Marty#4039
leif has added a payment processor, postgres database to track shares

[09/18/2021 1:52 AM] Elemental#9509
or better yet. I found this video on yt. It seems like a solid tutorial for setting up a pool but the only thing I'm unsure about is how to setup the non-numeric ip as the pool connection https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubov4oweA20

[09/18/2021 1:53 AM] Elemental#9509
But I do want to learn how others can connect, down the line


[09/18/2021 1:54 AM] Marty#4039
your router will need to allow DHCP reservations and port forwarding


[09/18/2021 1:54 AM] Marty#4039
assuming it's a modem/router, check the settings in there by logging into the admin panel


[09/18/2021 1:55 AM] Marty#4039
you can test it with a basic nginx server or node.js or something before worrying about the pool


[09/18/2021 1:55 AM] Marty#4039
but tbh its really easy to setup mhs_sam's stratum server


[09/18/2021 1:55 AM] Marty#4039
his docs on github are easy to folliw


[09/18/2021 1:56 AM] Elemental#9509
Noted. thanks for that lol


[09/18/2021 1:56 AM] Elemental#9509
I'm gonna stick with a local connection for now though just to test it but I'll definitely let you guys know once I get that fully functional, to learn more about external connections, if you guys would be willing to help lol


[09/18/2021 1:57 AM] Marty#4039
you setup an A+ record with your domain provider, then setup ddclient on your linux box


[09/18/2021 1:57 AM] Marty#4039
change the config file and it's up


[09/18/2021 1:58 AM] Marty#4039
follow the guide i linked


[09/18/2021 1:59 AM] Marty#4039
that'll get your domain running


[09/18/2021 1:59 AM] Elemental#9509
And this is for the non-numeric ip, correct?


[09/18/2021 1:59 AM] boomer#0823
right


[09/18/2021 1:59 AM] Marty#4039
domain.com


[09/18/2021 1:59 AM] Marty#4039
or whatever it is


[09/18/2021 1:59 AM] Elemental#9509
gotcha


[09/18/2021 2:00 AM] Elemental#9509
so just to confirm, the domain.com would be able to work on my local host without opening any ports, correct?


[09/18/2021 2:00 AM] Marty#4039
most ISPs don't have static IPs, that's why you run ddclient and use an A+ record


[09/18/2021 2:00 AM] Marty#4039
it'll check your IP every so many seconds and update the domain so that it always links to your IP


[09/18/2021 2:00 AM] Marty#4039
no, not correct


[09/18/2021 2:00 AM] Marty#4039
the domain is web facing


[09/18/2021 2:00 AM] boomer#0823
That's correct. If you setup a DNS server on your local network using that guide, you don't need to open anything to your network.


[09/18/2021 2:01 AM] boomer#0823
When you look into buying a domain or adding a record to your domain, that's the external stuff.


[09/18/2021 2:01 AM] Marty#4039
are you talking about running your own name server on your  local network?


[09/18/2021 2:01 AM] Marty#4039
i don't know anything about doing that


[09/18/2021 2:02 AM] Marty#4039
just test it on localhost


[09/18/2021 2:02 AM] Marty#4039
leave the domain stuff to when you're running a web-facing server


[09/18/2021 2:02 AM] Elemental#9509
Gotcha


[09/18/2021 2:02 AM] Marty#4039
don't use whatever.com for local testing


[09/18/2021 2:02 AM] boomer#0823
I'm pretty sure if you just set your local hostname to "example.local" or whatever, your internal network defined in your router admin page would let you connect to it from another machine.


[09/18/2021 2:02 AM] Marty#4039
use localhost:port


[09/18/2021 2:03 AM] Elemental#9509
And yeah will do. I don't wanna rush into anything so I'm just gonna test it on a localhost, using the numeric ip


[09/18/2021 2:03 AM] Marty#4039
you can use DHCP reservation and give each computer it's own internal IP that is static


[09/18/2021 2:03 AM] boomer#0823
I haven't done it on a windows machine but I know I did it on a couple of RPis a few years ago.


[09/18/2021 2:03 AM] boomer#0823
That's a good solve


[09/18/2021 2:04 AM] boomer#0823
If you only don't like the "look" of the numbers, you could try using localhost instead of 127.0.0.1


[09/18/2021 2:04 AM] Elemental#9509
I'm not too familiar with linux based stuff just yet so I'm just gonna stick with windows for now


[09/18/2021 2:05 AM] Marty#4039
you can still do dhcp reservation regardless.


[09/18/2021 2:05 AM] Marty#4039
that's at the router


[09/18/2021 2:05 AM] Elemental#9509

[09/18/2021 7:27 AM] Elemental#9509
Which I've done but I keep getting the same error


[09/18/2021 7:27 AM] Marty#4039
you gotta run the right version of node as well


[09/18/2021 7:27 AM] Elemental#9509
It tells me It cannot find a "bignum" folder


[09/18/2021 7:28 AM] Marty#4039
yeah you need to downgrade to the previous version


[09/18/2021 7:28 AM] Marty#4039
i think v12 will work


[09/18/2021 7:28 AM] Marty#4039
npm is gonna install v14 if you don't tell it otherwise


[09/18/2021 7:28 AM] Elemental#9509
so whenever I tried to do 'npm install bignum', it kept failing and told me to instal python, which i then did


[09/18/2021 7:29 AM] Marty#4039
i went through this exact same issue


[09/18/2021 7:29 AM] Marty#4039
try downgrading to the previous version of node


[09/18/2021 7:29 AM] Marty#4039
v12


[09/18/2021 7:29 AM] Elemental#9509
I'm currently using the latest version so I'll try v12


[09/18/2021 7:30 AM] Marty#4039
you're using v16?


[09/18/2021 7:30 AM] Elemental#9509

oh lts


[09/18/2021 7:31 AM] Marty#4039
yeah that's what npm installs by default i think


[09/18/2021 7:31 AM] Elemental#9509
should i try v16?


[09/18/2021 7:31 AM] Marty#4039
no try v12 lol


[09/18/2021 7:31 AM] Marty#4039
hopefully you installed with nvm


[09/18/2021 7:31 AM] Marty#4039
it's the easiest way to downgrade


[09/18/2021 7:31 AM] Marty#4039
but otherwise i think you have to uninstall everything and start again

which of the v12 should I do?


[09/18/2021 7:31 AM] Elemental#9509
most recent?


[09/18/2021 7:32 AM] Marty#4039

this is all it is


[09/18/2021 7:33 AM] Marty#4039
you're in the command line of node


[09/18/2021 7:34 AM] Marty#4039
get back to your command prompt


[09/18/2021 7:34 AM] Elemental#9509
as admin or no?


[09/18/2021 7:34 AM] Marty#4039
you gotta install node v12 with npm, after uninstalling the previous one


[09/18/2021 7:34 AM] Elemental#9509
oh


[09/18/2021 7:34 AM] Elemental#9509
right


[09/18/2021 7:34 AM] Marty#4039
pardon me i mean with nvm


[09/18/2021 7:34 AM] Marty#4039
nvm is the best way to install node beacsue you can change between versions on the fly


[09/18/2021 7:35 AM] Elemental#9509
done uninstalling


[09/18/2021 7:36 AM] Elemental#9509
So which am I downloading again?

i told you


[09/18/2021 7:37 AM] Marty#4039
install it with nvm


[09/18/2021 7:37 AM] Marty#4039
not by downloading the executable


[09/18/2021 7:37 AM] Elemental#9509
what's nvm exactly?


[09/18/2021 7:38 AM] Marty#4039
node version manager


[09/18/2021 7:38 AM] Marty#4039
a piece of software that installs node


[09/18/2021 7:38 AM] Marty#4039
i don't know if it works the same in windows

my node has yet to be fully synced


[09/18/2021 7:50 AM] Elemental#9509
By chance, is there a way for me to check the status of the sync?

i'm out for tonight. good luck


[09/18/2021 8:00 AM] Elemental#9509
Sounds good. Thanks for the assistance. Have a good one


[09/18/2021 8:21 PM] Elemental#9509
Sad. Still another 50k out from syncing


[09/18/2021 8:21 PM] Elemental#9509
Better than 500k though


[09/18/2021 10:58 PM] keiser1080#0143
i am  108K away from sync


[09/18/2021 11:02 PM] Elemental#9509
20k left for me üòÖ


[09/18/2021 11:43 PM] keiser1080#0143
50K now so  in 2h30 it should be 20K (based on your  feedback)


[09/18/2021 11:50 PM] Elemental#9509
It depends on your cpu. The faster the cpu, the faster the sync


[09/18/2021 11:50 PM] Elemental#9509
Debating on building a new pc with a 5900x now just to sync a permanent node fast üòÇ


[09/18/2021 11:53 PM] keiser1080#0143
The sync speed depend on the CPU speed?


[09/19/2021 12:01 AM] Elemental#9509
From what I heard from the a mod, it just depends on the cpu. I'm unsure if it's speed or core/thread amount


[09/19/2021 12:16 AM] keiser1080#0143
i don't think is true still 5,5 k for me.
and its done on a weak cpu ( N2800 )


[09/19/2021 12:17 AM] keiser1080#0143
so 44K in 33 min
Your node is sync ?


[09/19/2021 12:23 AM] keiser1080#0143
@Elemental best block is showing the current block but i still have "Active synchronization"???


[09/19/2021 12:24 AM] Elemental#9509
You on windows or linux?


[09/19/2021 12:24 AM] Elemental#9509
3k blocks left for me


[09/19/2021 12:25 AM] Elemental#9509
Also I'm unsure why yours is still syncing if it's the current block


[09/19/2021 12:26 AM] keiser1080#0143
linux


[09/19/2021 12:27 AM] keiser1080#0143
i don't know, the current height in my node is 11299.
i think the node height have to reach 579725


[09/19/2021 12:30 AM] keiser1080#0143
but it's growing fast, current height is 16663.
What is the height of your node interface ?


[09/19/2021 12:32 AM] Elemental#9509
That's probably why. Linux uses less resources


[09/19/2021 12:32 AM] Elemental#9509
Yes it has to reach the max height


[09/19/2021 12:48 AM] keiser1080#0143
50237 still 45k ,
your node is sync now ?


[09/19/2021 12:52 AM] Elemental#9509
Yep


[09/19/2021 12:53 AM] keiser1080#0143
congratulation üôÇ


[09/19/2021 12:57 AM] Elemental#9509
Thanks lol


[09/19/2021 2:03 AM] Elemental#9509
Hey @Marty I managed to figure out my previous issue and got a bit further ahead. The node is also done syncing so my cpu is no longer being choked so that's cool lol


[09/19/2021 2:04 AM] Elemental#9509
But I did end up running into another issue I was hoping you might be able to assist me with


[09/19/2021 2:05 AM] Marty#4039
as to your cpu discussion, my rpi4 took several hours, but my AMD ryzen 7 took less than 2 hours to sync the node


[09/19/2021 2:05 AM] Marty#4039
i can't remember how long exactly but it was really quick


[09/19/2021 2:05 AM] Elemental#9509
I checked and none of the the "require stack" files are missing so I'm unsure what could be the issue. I'm also not exactly sure where I'm supposed to look for or install "./build/Release/binding"


[09/19/2021 2:05 AM] Marty#4039
what version of node are you running


[09/19/2021 2:06 AM] Elemental#9509
v16


[09/19/2021 2:06 AM] Marty#4039
lmao


[09/19/2021 2:06 AM] Marty#4039
how many times did we discuss downgrading to v12 last night


[09/19/2021 2:06 AM] Elemental#9509
downgraded to v12


[09/19/2021 2:06 AM] Marty#4039
oh hahaha ok good


[09/19/2021 2:06 AM] Elemental#9509
had the same result


[09/19/2021 2:06 AM] Elemental#9509
so went back to 16


[09/19/2021 2:07 AM] Marty#4039
whats your config file look like


[09/19/2021 2:07 AM] Marty#4039
keep in mind this stratum server is based no nomp so it's super old code


[09/19/2021 2:07 AM] Marty#4039
mhs_sam just updated it a bit to work with ergo


[09/19/2021 2:07 AM] Elemental#9509
the 'start.js' file, correct?


[09/19/2021 2:08 AM] Elemental#9509
or are you referring to the ergo.conf file


[09/19/2021 2:08 AM] Marty#4039
i don't remember


[09/19/2021 2:08 AM] Marty#4039
i just followed sams instructions on the git


[09/19/2021 2:09 AM] Elemental#9509
yeah same lol. I feel like it's missing some stuff though


[09/19/2021 2:10 AM] Elemental#9509
specifically with setting up the stratum server


[09/19/2021 2:11 AM] Marty#4039
did you run npm update


[09/19/2021 2:11 AM] Marty#4039
with v12


[09/19/2021 2:11 AM] Elemental#9509
I forgot which version I ran it on, but yes, I did run npm update


[09/19/2021 2:12 AM] Marty#4039
try with v12


[09/19/2021 2:12 AM] Marty#4039
i never got it to work with any newer version of node


[09/19/2021 2:12 AM] Marty#4039
other than that, i don't have any other suggestions


[09/19/2021 2:12 AM] Elemental#9509
alright will do rn


[09/19/2021 2:21 AM] Marty#4039
dunno what to tell you tbh


[09/19/2021 2:21 AM] Elemental#9509
all good. By chance, do you know anyone (on here) who is familiar with setting this up on windows?


[09/19/2021 2:24 AM] Elemental#9509
oh I see what I did wrong. Hold up. Gonna recompile


[09/19/2021 2:39 AM] Elemental#9509
Well I managed to figure it out


[09/19/2021 2:39 AM] Elemental#9509
That was surprisingly a lot easier than it originally seemed to be


[09/19/2021 2:40 AM] Marty#4039
what did you do wrong


[09/19/2021 2:40 AM] Marty#4039
yeah super easy to setup


[09/19/2021 2:40 AM] Marty#4039
same with the node


[09/19/2021 2:41 AM] Elemental#9509
I now have a running node (I still need to mine to test it) but the only issue left is the address I put within this is too long apparently:
```
    "rewardRecipients": {
        "MyAddress": 50, //50% goes to pool op
    },
```


[09/19/2021 2:42 AM] Elemental#9509
So it gives me this error:
```error: [No rewardRecipients have been setup which means no fees will be taken] undefined```


[09/19/2021 2:43 AM] Elemental#9509
I put my address, from Yoroi wallet, in here, and this is what happens ^


[09/19/2021 2:43 AM] Marty#4039
yeah its a bug


[09/19/2021 2:43 AM] Marty#4039
leif has fixed that one i think. i just left it out


[09/19/2021 2:43 AM] Marty#4039
can get them later in your payment processor


[09/19/2021 2:43 AM] Marty#4039
you dont need to stratum server to do it


[09/19/2021 2:44 AM] Elemental#9509
I'm not exactly sure. Everything was done exactly the same way. I think it just might have had something to do with the node version I compiled the original ErgoStratumServer folder on


[09/19/2021 2:44 AM] Elemental#9509
but i just deleted it and recompiled it and everything worked immediately


[09/19/2021 2:45 AM] Elemental#9509
Where would I find the "fixed" version of this?

[09/19/2021 2:46 AM] Marty#4039
check his page, there's a few repos


[09/19/2021 2:46 AM] Marty#4039
it's one of those


[09/19/2021 2:47 AM] Elemental#9509
True. But I think it'd be better for the node to do it if I end up deciding to actually go through with making a fully-functioning public pool


[09/19/2021 2:48 AM] Marty#4039
imean you can get your payout


[09/19/2021 2:48 AM] Marty#4039
like you don't need to hold back 0.5% at the stratum server, just don't pay that much out to the miners later


[09/19/2021 2:50 AM] Elemental#9509
right good point


[09/19/2021 3:14 AM] Elemental#9509
So I currently have the full node setup but I'm not exactly sure what ip/pool url to connect to, on my miner (on hiveos)
Any advice?


[09/19/2021 5:25 AM] Elemental#9509
Hey man. If I may ask.. how did you get past this part? I managed to connect a proxy but I am unable to connect to it, via my secondary pc, on the same network

[09/19/2021 5:26 AM] Marty#4039
if you're connecting from another device on the network, it's not going to be localhost


[09/19/2021 5:26 AM] Marty#4039
you have to find that devices network address


[09/19/2021 5:26 AM] Marty#4039
i told you before about DHCP reservation, that's what i was talking about


[09/19/2021 5:27 AM] Marty#4039
try ipconfig on the stratum server host


[09/19/2021 5:27 AM] Marty#4039
i can't remember if it tells you your internal ip address


[09/19/2021 5:27 AM] Elemental#9509
it does not


[09/19/2021 5:27 AM] Marty#4039
check your router then


[09/19/2021 5:27 AM] Marty#4039
login to your router, it should have a list of connected devices


[09/19/2021 5:28 AM] Elemental#9509
kk


[09/19/2021 5:28 AM] Marty#4039
and make sure to use dhcp reservation to give the host a static internal IP


[09/19/2021 5:28 AM] Marty#4039
that'll help you later too


[09/19/2021 5:28 AM] Marty#4039
and it will mean you don't have to check its assignment each time it reboots


[09/19/2021 5:28 AM] Elemental#9509
How do I do this, if i may ask?


[09/19/2021 5:29 AM] Marty#4039
google it for your router


[09/19/2021 5:29 AM] Marty#4039
if you're not familiar with something, i'd suggest trying to google it


[09/19/2021 5:29 AM] Marty#4039
there's way better answers out there than i can give you


[09/19/2021 5:30 AM] Elemental#9509
yeah I'm pretty much googling everything at this point üòÖ


[09/19/2021 6:39 AM] Elemental#9509
Question. Is NB or NVMiner the only miner that can be used for ergo mining? because I've been looking into setting this up and i keep hearing about changing something within a 'config.json' file on the miner. T-rex miner supports ergo mining but it doesn't have a config.json file so what are my options with setting that up?


[09/19/2021 6:45 AM] Elemental#9509
Or maybe it does but I'm unsure how to access it via HiveOs


[09/19/2021 8:38 AM] Marty#4039
you can use lolminer, team red miner (though that'll throw bad shares with the stratum server you're using), nbminer, t-rex


[09/19/2021 8:38 AM] Marty#4039
i like nbminer


[09/19/2021 8:39 AM] Marty#4039
i use nbminer in hiveos


[09/19/2021 9:09 AM] Elemental#9509
And what about this 'config.json' file that I see people before me, in here, talking about needing to edit and change the port to :3000


[09/19/2021 9:09 AM] Elemental#9509
How do we access that file from hiveos?


[09/19/2021 11:29 AM] keiser1080#0143
the node sync reach the 84567 height but there are no more evolution.
Do you think i need to restart the node ?


[09/19/2021 9:01 PM] Elemental#9509
Yeah. If it's not climbing anymore, Try restarting it


[09/19/2021 9:08 PM] keiser1080#0143
I think is due to the CPU
To weak


[09/19/2021 9:08 PM] keiser1080#0143
I have downloaded all the file to my laptop


[09/19/2021 9:08 PM] keiser1080#0143
Now the node is sync.
So I upload back all the file


[09/19/2021 9:09 PM] keiser1080#0143
7Gb


[09/19/2021 9:10 PM] keiser1080#0143
There is I light config.
If needed I will swap to light node.
I have to figure out how to do that


[09/19/2021 10:29 PM] Elemental#9509
Possibly


[09/19/2021 10:30 PM] Elemental#9509
I'm still stuck on trying to figure out how to connect my rig to my pool/node/proxy üòÖ


[09/19/2021 10:43 PM] Elemental#9509
What makes it worse with trying to figure this out is that everytime I search up anything with "ergo proxy" in it, nothing related to crypto shows up. Just a bunch of anime


[09/19/2021 10:45 PM] keiser1080#0143
Search for ergo crypto proxy


[09/20/2021 9:26 AM] Elemental#9509
I find it really weird how I seemingly have everything setup properly yet I for some reason can't figure why I keep getting a "Broken Pipe" error on my miner (2nd PC) when trying to connect to my node/pool (On the 1st PC)


[09/20/2021 9:39 AM] andee#4722
use node + stratum server. no proxy


[09/20/2021 9:39 AM] Elemental#9509
Pretty sure I tried that already but let me try again


[09/20/2021 9:40 AM] andee#4722
double check stratum node config, connect to the right port


[09/20/2021 9:42 AM] Elemental#9509
You're referring to the start.js config within the ErgoStratumServer folder, correct?


[09/20/2021 9:43 AM] andee#4722
yes, correct "daemons" and using a port that is under "ports"


[09/20/2021 9:44 AM] Elemental#9509
```
    "daemons": [
        {   //Main daemon instance
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": 9053,
            "user": "litecoinrpc",
            "password": "testnet"
        }
    ],
```


[09/20/2021 9:44 AM] Elemental#9509
Am I supposed to replace the 9053 in this section with 3256?


[09/20/2021 9:44 AM] Elemental#9509
```
    "ports": {
        "3032": { //A port for your miners to connect to

```


[09/20/2021 9:44 AM] andee#4722
no


[09/20/2021 9:45 AM] andee#4722
"ports" is what the miner is connecting to


[09/20/2021 9:45 AM] Elemental#9509
kk


[09/20/2021 9:45 AM] Elemental#9509
yeah that's what I got


[09/20/2021 9:45 AM] Elemental#9509
Also


[09/20/2021 9:45 AM] Elemental#9509
actually


[09/20/2021 9:45 AM] Elemental#9509
let me pm you my setup because i dont think saying my ip here would be a good idea lol


[09/20/2021 10:43 AM] Elemental#9509
Yooo so I managed to figure out why my rig wasn't connecting. I had my Networking profile on my pc set to Public instead of Private

[09/20/2021 10:45 AM] Elemental#9509
So it's connected now so that's awesome. It's been running for 15 min now but it doesn't seem to be submitting any shares. Any thoughts?


[09/20/2021 10:52 AM] CryptoMinerOS#1745
What diff is sent by the pool? If it is too high it will take a while for the miner to send shares.


[09/20/2021 10:52 AM] Elemental#9509
256. Is this too high?
```
        "3256": { //Another port for your miners to connect to, this port does not use varDiff
            "diff": 256 //The pool difficulty
        }
```


[09/20/2021 12:42 PM] CryptoMinerOS#1745
Check on your miner and see what the diff is. You should see something like  4GH or something.


[09/20/2021 4:03 PM] ProSavage#7131
reference ergo stratum doesnt use diff like in GH


[09/20/2021 4:03 PM] ProSavage#7131
it was weird, I think it did diff math in target instead


[09/20/2021 4:04 PM] ProSavage#7131
they have to inverse it to put it into human friendly standards


[09/21/2021 1:36 AM] CryptoMinerOS#1745
That is why I asked to look on the miner as the miner should display the equivalent GH value sent by the pool.


[09/21/2021 1:51 AM] Elemental#9509
On trex, The difficulty is 4.04P, at 2164319 diff


[09/21/2021 4:22 AM] Marty#4039
yeah stratum server is doing the math wrong


[09/21/2021 4:22 AM] Marty#4039
4P is 1000x more difficult than the entire ergo network


[09/21/2021 4:25 AM] Marty#4039
does your algoproperties.js have this value: 
`blake: {
        multiplier: Math.pow(2, 8),
        hash: function(){
            return function(){
                return multiHashing.blake.apply(this, arguments);
            }
        }
    },`


[09/21/2021 4:25 AM] Marty#4039
i remember when I was running NOMP before, it was multiplying it wrong


[09/21/2021 4:30 AM] Marty#4039
here's the diff @Leif Erickson set for tulipfarm, this might help you:
`    "ports": {
        "8009": { //A port for your miners to connect to
            "diff": 2000000000, //the pool difficulty for this port
            /*
            * use this parameter to multiply difficulty to b for each request.
            * some miner like NBMiner does not support difficulty method of stratum.
            * if you want your pool work with these miners set this parameters.
            *
            * */
            "multiplyDifficulty": true,
            /* Variable difficulty is a feature that will automatically adjust difficulty for
               individual miners based on their hashrate in order to lower networking overhead */
            "varDiff": {
                "minDiff": 200000000, //Minimum difficulty
                "maxDiff": 200000000000, //Network difficulty will be used if it is lower than this
                "targetTime": 15, //Try to get 1 share per this many seconds
                "retargetTime": 10, //Check to see if we should retarget every this many seconds
                "variancePercent": 30 //Allow time to very this % from target without retargeting
            }
        },
        "8008": { //Another port for your miners to connect to, this port does not use varDiff
            "diff": 2000000000 //The pool difficulty
        }`


[09/21/2021 4:30 AM] Elemental#9509
let me check


[09/21/2021 4:31 AM] Marty#4039
vardiff doesn't seem to work properly, so just connect to the port that doesn't use vardiff while you're testing


[09/21/2021 4:31 AM] Marty#4039
https://github.com/WinterTFG/TulipFarm/blob/dev/stratum/start.js


[09/21/2021 4:31 AM] Elemental#9509
In algoProperties.js
```
    blake: {
        multiplier: Math.pow(2, 8),
        hash: function(){
            return function(){
                return multiHashing.blake.apply(this, arguments);
            }
        }
    },
```


[09/21/2021 4:33 AM] Elemental#9509
should I just delete my ErgoStratumServer and compile this instead?


[09/21/2021 4:33 AM] Marty#4039
no


[09/21/2021 4:33 AM] Marty#4039
that will try to link to the docker IP he set.


[09/21/2021 4:33 AM] Elemental#9509
and edit the start.js* to my info


[09/21/2021 4:33 AM] Marty#4039
look at the part i highlighted that changes pool difficulty, and use what is appropriate for you


[09/21/2021 4:34 AM] Marty#4039
probably best to connect to the port that doesn't allow vardiff


[09/21/2021 4:34 AM] Marty#4039
and instead of using 256, set it to 2GH or 4GH


[09/21/2021 4:34 AM] Marty#4039
`"diff": 4000000000`


[09/21/2021 4:35 AM] Elemental#9509
so leave my StratumServer alone, but just add a new port with ```
"diff": 4000000000
``` correct?


[09/21/2021 4:35 AM] Marty#4039
you could just use the port you're already using


[09/21/2021 4:35 AM] Marty#4039
`        "3256": { //Another port for your miners to connect to, this port does not use varDiff
            "diff": 256 //The pool difficulty
        }`


[09/21/2021 4:35 AM] Elemental#9509
yeah forgot that was an option lol


[09/21/2021 5:05 AM] Elemental#9509
Oh btw @Marty What would I need to do to fix the issue with the address length?


[09/21/2021 5:05 AM] Elemental#9509
where it says it's not valid because it's too long


[09/21/2021 5:05 AM] Marty#4039
i didn't look into it. Just delete that bit


[09/21/2021 5:05 AM] Marty#4039
comment out all the lines that contain addresses


[09/21/2021 5:06 AM] Elemental#9509
you linked Leaf's github but i wasn't sure what part to snip it out from


[09/21/2021 5:06 AM] Marty#4039
except for the one that has the node's wallet address


[09/21/2021 5:06 AM] Elemental#9509
yeah that's what i did for now


[09/21/2021 5:06 AM] Marty#4039
you shouldn't get an error message any more


[09/21/2021 5:06 AM] Marty#4039
it's trying to make the addresses conform to bitcoins standards. you'd have to look through the code and find where it does that. I never bothered


[09/21/2021 5:06 AM] Elemental#9509
yeah lol. just kinda bothers me knowing that there's an issue out in there üòÇ


[09/21/2021 5:06 AM] Marty#4039
we just put the fee in that payout script


[09/21/2021 5:07 AM] Marty#4039
well you could go fix it but it doesn't matter


[09/21/2021 5:07 AM] Marty#4039
the stratum server code there is old af. like 7 years old


[09/21/2021 5:07 AM] Elemental#9509
I noticed


[09/21/2021 5:07 AM] Marty#4039
it's just modified just enough to make it work with ergo


[09/21/2021 5:08 AM] Marty#4039
prosavage went the smart route and figured out how a stratum server works, then wrote his own in typescript


[09/21/2021 5:09 AM] Marty#4039
he analysed the packets sent between miners and servers, and studied how the algorithm works and how a mining pool splits the work between miners, then wrote it himself. he did it over a weekend too i think, so obviously has a lot of experience.


[09/21/2021 5:10 AM] Elemental#9509
I honestly might do this tbh. I kinda wanna code it myself just so ik what exactly is going on


[09/21/2021 5:10 AM] Marty#4039
have you wrote software before?


[09/21/2021 5:11 AM] Elemental#9509
eh, I've written minecraft plugins, developed websites, and learned a bit of C++ when I was into game development for some time


[09/21/2021 5:11 AM] Marty#4039
go through the stratum server code you have and figure out how it works


[09/21/2021 5:11 AM] Elemental#9509
i assume it would be a similar process lol


[09/21/2021 5:12 AM] Marty#4039
you could write it in rust. or javascript. prosavage used typescript which is type-safe javascript


[09/21/2021 5:12 AM] Marty#4039
but first reverse engineer whats there until you understand each function


[09/21/2021 5:12 AM] Marty#4039
maybe fix the team red miner bug. it seems to submit only invalid shares


[09/21/2021 5:13 AM] Marty#4039
leif wrote his version in python, but he didn't write a new stratum server yet


[09/21/2021 5:13 AM] Elemental#9509
I'll take a look into it. Could be fun to write a new stratum server lol


[09/21/2021 5:13 AM] Marty#4039
you should do it


[09/21/2021 5:32 AM] Elemental#9509
figured out the length issue. that was easy lol


[09/21/2021 5:38 AM] Marty#4039
cool, i figured


[09/21/2021 5:38 AM] Marty#4039
i never looked into it


[09/21/2021 5:53 AM] Elemental#9509
I'm kinda just customizing the stratum now at this point. This is already a lot of fun üòÇ


[09/21/2021 6:17 AM] Elemental#9509
the smallest changes always make the biggest difference üòÑ

[09/21/2021 6:42 AM] ProSavage#7131
Ive seen u around I think


[09/21/2021 6:42 AM] Elemental#9509
fancy seeing you here bro


[09/21/2021 6:42 AM] ProSavage#7131
yep


[09/21/2021 6:42 AM] ProSavage#7131
I was looking to be done with minecraft so I did this


[09/21/2021 6:43 AM] Marty#4039
You can probably find where this error message is being generated and just remove that functionality entirely


[09/21/2021 6:43 AM] Elemental#9509
I'm kinda still doing mc but it's not really my main focus anymore


[09/21/2021 6:43 AM] Marty#4039
You could make an NFT based minecraft style Ergo game


[09/21/2021 6:43 AM] ProSavage#7131
haha I dont want to deal with the community anymore


[09/21/2021 6:43 AM] ProSavage#7131
I like my miners on my pool


[09/21/2021 6:43 AM] ProSavage#7131
everyone is mature


[09/21/2021 6:43 AM] Elemental#9509
I spent 3 years developing my own server which has still yet to be released and seeing as mc is pretty much a dead game now, I've kinda lost motivation üòÖ

well


[09/21/2021 6:44 AM] ProSavage#7131
welcome to crypto I guess


[09/21/2021 6:44 AM] Elemental#9509
The community is alright in my opinion, but miners are definitely a lot more fun to talk to lol


[09/21/2021 6:44 AM] ProSavage#7131
I got into it in september


[09/21/2021 6:44 AM] ProSavage#7131
its a fun little thing


[09/21/2021 6:45 AM] Elemental#9509
Nice! I got into it in February lol


[09/21/2021 6:45 AM] ProSavage#7131
Im at around 30 gpus


[09/21/2021 6:45 AM] ProSavage#7131
and decided a mining pool is gonna be fun


[09/21/2021 6:45 AM] Elemental#9509
Just recently decided I wanted to start my own mining pool


[09/21/2021 6:45 AM] Marty#4039
damn


[09/21/2021 6:45 AM] ProSavage#7131
I mostly did it for the boys at flexpool


[09/21/2021 6:45 AM] ProSavage#7131
they asking if anyone can make a mining pool


[09/21/2021 6:45 AM] Marty#4039
do you live someplace cold?


[09/21/2021 6:45 AM] ProSavage#7131
nah


[09/21/2021 6:45 AM] Elemental#9509
and considering ergo for some reason really gets my attention, I figured I'd start here lol


[09/21/2021 6:45 AM] ProSavage#7131
in the south of the usa


[09/21/2021 6:45 AM] ProSavage#7131

see I thought I would be happy with 5


[09/21/2021 6:47 AM] Marty#4039
i think 3080 ti is best bang for the buck right now


[09/21/2021 6:47 AM] ProSavage#7131
1 1660s


[09/21/2021 6:47 AM] ProSavage#7131

[09/21/2021 6:48 AM] Marty#4039
that's really good, best hash to watt you can get i think


[09/21/2021 6:48 AM] ProSavage#7131
come join my little pool


[09/21/2021 6:48 AM] ProSavage#7131
most of us are devs


[09/21/2021 6:48 AM] ProSavage#7131
we doing a little hackathon project in mining as well


[09/21/2021 6:48 AM] ProSavage#7131
for ergo hacks


[09/21/2021 6:48 AM] ProSavage#7131
discord.gg/enigmapool


[09/21/2021 6:48 AM] Marty#4039
are you going to opensource your pool?


[09/21/2021 6:48 AM] ProSavage#7131
eh


[09/21/2021 6:48 AM] ProSavage#7131
at one point yes


[09/21/2021 6:49 AM] ProSavage#7131
Im working on v1 still


[09/21/2021 6:49 AM] ProSavage#7131
long ways to go


[09/21/2021 6:49 AM] Elemental#9509
would have had a 3060 ti and 3080 but sold those. I regret selling the 60ti but the 80 was a $1500 zotac and i was not willing to keep/waste that much on a single card


[09/21/2021 6:49 AM] ProSavage#7131
working on a full scale monitoring sysem right now


[09/21/2021 6:49 AM] ProSavage#7131
i like open source, but its closed source for security reasons


[09/21/2021 6:49 AM] Marty#4039
what data do you want it to track


[09/21/2021 6:49 AM] Marty#4039
yeah makes sense


[09/21/2021 6:49 AM] ProSavage#7131
well


[09/21/2021 6:49 AM] ProSavage#7131
the entire architecture is event driven microservices


[09/21/2021 6:49 AM] ProSavage#7131
I need a whole logging system up


[09/21/2021 6:50 AM] ProSavage#7131
I need a system where the entire pool functions with services down


[09/21/2021 6:50 AM] ProSavage#7131
I need kubernetes support


[09/21/2021 6:50 AM] ProSavage#7131
I need to probably get logstash working


[09/21/2021 6:50 AM] Marty#4039
wow


[09/21/2021 6:50 AM] ProSavage#7131
II need to switch to rabbitmq from bullmq


[09/21/2021 6:50 AM] Marty#4039
we were going to do it with docker swarm


[09/21/2021 6:50 AM] Elemental#9509
Honestly.. If you wanted to help me setup my pool. I'll gladly dedicate all my hashrate to your pool for a while until mine is up and running üòÇ


[09/21/2021 6:50 AM] ProSavage#7131
helping setup pool is iffy


[09/21/2021 6:50 AM] ProSavage#7131
I wont be giving out any code lol


[09/21/2021 6:51 AM] ProSavage#7131
but I cna explain the math


[09/21/2021 6:51 AM] ProSavage#7131
the reference stratum's math is slow


[09/21/2021 6:51 AM] ProSavage#7131
you can make it ~10x faster for share verification


[09/21/2021 6:51 AM] Marty#4039
i've never worked with k8s but i'm told it's not worth the learning curve for less than a 20 server cluster


[09/21/2021 6:51 AM] ProSavage#7131
ne beutger


[09/21/2021 6:51 AM] ProSavage#7131
me neither*


[09/21/2021 6:51 AM] ProSavage#7131
üôÇ


[09/21/2021 6:51 AM] ProSavage#7131
but its something to learn


[09/21/2021 6:51 AM] Marty#4039
i had a feeling about this!


[09/21/2021 6:51 AM] ProSavage#7131
20 servers arent really too little for a mining pool


[09/21/2021 6:51 AM] Elemental#9509
right. I heard something about it being slow prior but wasn't exactly sure what they meant since I'm barely going through the stratum code rn


[09/21/2021 6:51 AM] ProSavage#7131
we have 8 already


[09/21/2021 6:52 AM] ProSavage#7131
keep in mind theyre tiny little clusters


[09/21/2021 6:52 AM] ProSavage#7131
but the whole system is meant to scale horizontally


[09/21/2021 6:52 AM] ProSavage#7131
the stratum code is a cluster fuck but its readable


[09/21/2021 6:52 AM] ProSavage#7131
and it does have the info u need


[09/21/2021 6:52 AM] ProSavage#7131
I did it


[09/21/2021 6:52 AM] Marty#4039
are you using containerd with k8s?


[09/21/2021 6:52 AM] ProSavage#7131
no just docker right now


[09/21/2021 6:52 AM] ProSavage#7131
no scaling yet.


[09/21/2021 6:52 AM] Marty#4039
was thinking of trying to learn it


[09/21/2021 6:52 AM] Marty#4039
since k8s depracated docker


[09/21/2021 6:52 AM] ProSavage#7131
I need to switch to containerd


[09/21/2021 6:52 AM] ProSavage#7131
yeah


[09/21/2021 6:52 AM] ProSavage#7131
was gonna say they depreceated docker


[09/21/2021 6:52 AM] ProSavage#7131
Im working on a side project right now to build a massive hashrate farm


[09/21/2021 6:52 AM] Elemental#9509
oo


[09/21/2021 6:53 AM] Elemental#9509
actually


[09/21/2021 6:53 AM] Elemental#9509
i wanna see your setup now üòÇ


[09/21/2021 6:53 AM] Elemental#9509
got any rig pics?


[09/21/2021 6:53 AM] ProSavage#7131
someone paying me to make them a program that can afk mine on peoples pc for giftcards


[09/21/2021 6:53 AM] Marty#4039
that's pretty cool. you should hit up leif, he's got some investors for some massive crypto mining farms in the states


[09/21/2021 6:53 AM] ProSavage#7131
Im mostly there with my prototype


[09/21/2021 6:53 AM] ProSavage#7131
it works using a browser too


[09/21/2021 6:53 AM] Marty#4039
oh thats different nvm


[09/21/2021 6:53 AM] ProSavage#7131
yea lol


[09/21/2021 6:53 AM] ProSavage#7131
basically a service to to replace the tings where u do surveys for money


[09/21/2021 6:54 AM] Marty#4039
sounds cool


[09/21/2021 6:54 AM] ProSavage#7131
instead


[09/21/2021 6:54 AM] ProSavage#7131
just use ur trustly 1660s and make it mine in freetime


[09/21/2021 6:54 AM] ProSavage#7131
with no install or anything


[09/21/2021 6:54 AM] Marty#4039
may as well, they going to waste otherwise. pay off your expensive GPU üòâ


[09/21/2021 6:54 AM] ProSavage#7131
yerp


[09/21/2021 6:55 AM] ProSavage#7131
@Elemental gimme ur hash bb


[09/21/2021 6:55 AM] ProSavage#7131
we neeeeed it


[09/21/2021 6:55 AM] ProSavage#7131
6 days no blonk


[09/21/2021 6:55 AM] Marty#4039
i was thinking of switching over to your pool too


[09/21/2021 6:55 AM] Marty#4039
i just really like wooly


[09/21/2021 6:55 AM] ProSavage#7131
we have 7.44 ergo bounty


[09/21/2021 6:55 AM] ProSavage#7131
I basically wrote fuckin gambling


[09/21/2021 6:56 AM] Marty#4039
for finding a block?


[09/21/2021 6:56 AM] ProSavage#7131
go read the home page


[09/21/2021 6:56 AM] ProSavage#7131
yea


[09/21/2021 6:56 AM] Elemental#9509
help my get my pool up and running, with a non numeric ip, and sure üòÇ I work out the code efficiency later on


[09/21/2021 6:56 AM] ProSavage#7131
idk wtf u on about non numeric ip


[09/21/2021 6:56 AM] ProSavage#7131
point that bitch on cloudflare


[09/21/2021 6:56 AM] ProSavage#7131
go make a non proxied A record


[09/21/2021 6:56 AM] ProSavage#7131
idk what u trying to do


[09/21/2021 6:56 AM] Elemental#9509
That's my problem bro. Idk how to point it to cloudflare üòÇ


[09/21/2021 6:56 AM] Marty#4039
lol that's waht i told him to do


[09/21/2021 6:57 AM] ProSavage#7131
fuck u mean


[09/21/2021 6:57 AM] ProSavage#7131
change the name servers


[09/21/2021 6:57 AM] ProSavage#7131
profit?


[09/21/2021 6:57 AM] ProSavage#7131
I need to make a guide on a mining pool implementation


[09/21/2021 6:57 AM] ProSavage#7131
but thats really the least of my worries


[09/21/2021 6:57 AM] Elemental#9509
do it


[09/21/2021 6:57 AM] Elemental#9509
rn


[09/21/2021 6:57 AM] Elemental#9509
:stare:


[09/21/2021 6:57 AM] ProSavage#7131
I mean Im too busy


[09/21/2021 6:57 AM] ProSavage#7131
im watching harry potter bro


[09/21/2021 6:58 AM] ProSavage#7131
I just spent like 5 hours working on a school project


[09/21/2021 6:58 AM] Elemental#9509
which one :stare:


[09/21/2021 6:58 AM] ProSavage#7131
I had to write a paralell computing project using child processes in raw c


[09/21/2021 6:58 AM] ProSavage#7131
I wanted to die


[09/21/2021 6:58 AM] ProSavage#7131
mostly because I dont ever use C or know those concepts


[09/21/2021 6:58 AM] Marty#4039
you should be happy


[09/21/2021 6:58 AM] ProSavage#7131
learned how to use a pipe and other coool stuff


[09/21/2021 6:58 AM] ProSavage#7131
was cool


[09/21/2021 6:58 AM] Marty#4039
now you know how to do it


[09/21/2021 6:58 AM] ProSavage#7131
ya


[09/21/2021 6:58 AM] ProSavage#7131
was cool


[09/21/2021 6:59 AM] ProSavage#7131
lowkey wanna fuck around and write a stratum in c


[09/21/2021 6:59 AM] Marty#4039
nothing wrong with C


[09/21/2021 6:59 AM] Marty#4039
people just dont like the extra work


[09/21/2021 6:59 AM] ProSavage#7131
it just does nothing for u


[09/21/2021 6:59 AM] ProSavage#7131
yeah :KEKW:


[09/21/2021 6:59 AM] Marty#4039
and you dont need to


[09/21/2021 6:59 AM] ProSavage#7131
I use javascript baby


[09/21/2021 7:00 AM] Elemental#9509
javascript op


[09/21/2021 7:00 AM] ProSavage#7131
entire pool in javascript


[09/21/2021 7:00 AM] Marty#4039
use rust if you need to have more control over memory access


[09/21/2021 7:00 AM] ProSavage#7131
I wanna learn rust


[09/21/2021 7:00 AM] Marty#4039
are you taking a computer science degree?


[09/21/2021 7:00 AM] ProSavage#7131
im a senior


[09/21/2021 7:00 AM] ProSavage#7131
about to graduate


[09/21/2021 7:00 AM] ProSavage#7131
I dont know any languages other than java/kotlin & javascript/typescript


[09/21/2021 7:00 AM] Marty#4039
like highschool senior?


[09/21/2021 7:00 AM] ProSavage#7131
no


[09/21/2021 7:01 AM] ProSavage#7131
a undergrad senior


[09/21/2021 7:01 AM] Marty#4039
oh i dont know how you americans describe things


[09/21/2021 7:01 AM] ProSavage#7131
yea I got u


[09/21/2021 7:01 AM] ProSavage#7131
no im about to grad college


[09/21/2021 7:01 AM] Marty#4039
cool


[09/21/2021 7:01 AM] ProSavage#7131
hence me getting a dev job with ergo


[09/21/2021 7:01 AM] Marty#4039
i'm too old to go back to school but i would take computer science for sure


[09/21/2021 7:01 AM] ProSavage#7131
yeah in CS there really isnt a bunch of language learning.


[09/21/2021 7:01 AM] Marty#4039
my gf is a mortgage broker, she says all the wealthiest clients are doctors, lawyers, and software devs


[09/21/2021 7:01 AM] ProSavage#7131
its more conceptual and math for me


[09/21/2021 7:02 AM] Marty#4039
any game theory?


[09/21/2021 7:02 AM] ProSavage#7131
which is good


[09/21/2021 7:02 AM] ProSavage#7131
wtf is game theory


[09/21/2021 7:02 AM] Marty#4039
look it up


[09/21/2021 7:02 AM] ProSavage#7131
like software design concepts?


[09/21/2021 7:02 AM] Marty#4039
lol


[09/21/2021 7:02 AM] Marty#4039
they used it a lot to develop cardano


[09/21/2021 7:02 AM] ProSavage#7131
no, not really


[09/21/2021 7:02 AM] Marty#4039
a bunch of the science papers they wrote relate to abstract algebra expressed through game theory, as far as i can tell


[09/21/2021 7:02 AM] ProSavage#7131
I did a class on graph theory


[09/21/2021 7:03 AM] ProSavage#7131
Im in a formal languages course rn


[09/21/2021 7:03 AM] ProSavage#7131
which is math


[09/21/2021 7:03 AM] Marty#4039
it's like... if you're in a scenario where you know your potential outcome, how will you logically behave


[09/21/2021 7:03 AM] Marty#4039
it's like scenarios involving multiple parties and choices


[09/21/2021 7:03 AM] ProSavage#7131
yeah I got u


[09/21/2021 7:03 AM] Marty#4039
the biggest example is the prisoner dillema


[09/21/2021 7:03 AM] Marty#4039
or most popular and basic example


[09/21/2021 7:04 AM] Marty#4039
i don't know graph theory


[09/21/2021 7:04 AM] Marty#4039
but that high level math will serve you well in crypto


[09/21/2021 7:04 AM] ProSavage#7131
Im going to be graduating in a undergrad in CS and a double minor in statistics and business


[09/21/2021 7:05 AM] ProSavage#7131
Ive got a 16 hour semester now and a 16 hour one next sem due to minors


[09/21/2021 7:05 AM] ProSavage#7131
but if I do everything correctly


[09/21/2021 7:05 AM] ProSavage#7131
then we big chillin


[09/21/2021 7:05 AM] ProSavage#7131
no more school


[09/21/2021 7:05 AM] Marty#4039
yeah you'll be fine


[09/21/2021 7:05 AM] Marty#4039
if you're in your 20s you'll be laughing by your 30s


[09/21/2021 7:05 AM] ProSavage#7131
Im 20


[09/21/2021 7:05 AM] Marty#4039
hahaha fucker


[09/21/2021 7:05 AM] ProSavage#7131
lambo speedrun bro


[09/21/2021 7:05 AM] ProSavage#7131
except I wont buy a lambo


[09/21/2021 7:06 AM] ProSavage#7131
too much money to spend on car


[09/21/2021 7:06 AM] Marty#4039
just buy property


[09/21/2021 7:06 AM] Elemental#9509
I should honestly be graduating college soon but I decided to take a break because of covid. There's no way I'm doing online school again


[09/21/2021 7:06 AM] Elemental#9509
they literally don't teach you anything


[09/21/2021 7:06 AM] ProSavage#7131
online school op wdym


[09/21/2021 7:06 AM] Marty#4039
get that degree


[09/21/2021 7:06 AM] Marty#4039
who cares if they teach you it, learn on your own. you'll be self learning the rest of your career


[09/21/2021 7:06 AM] Marty#4039
teach yourself how to teach yourself


[09/21/2021 7:07 AM] Marty#4039
shit changes. I was a web developer 10 years ago, nothing is even close


[09/21/2021 7:07 AM] Marty#4039
it was PHP and jquery and shit


[09/21/2021 7:07 AM] Marty#4039
ruby was new


[09/21/2021 7:07 AM] Marty#4039
i'm relearning everything


[09/21/2021 7:07 AM] Elemental#9509
I learned more going through everything myself than spending 3 months waiting for them to explain something that should have only taken 5 minutes


[09/21/2021 7:07 AM] Marty#4039
yeah learn it, don't wait for them


[09/21/2021 7:08 AM] Marty#4039
maybe it was more than 10 years ago now... damn


[09/21/2021 7:08 AM] ProSavage#7131
I always teach my self + exactly


[09/21/2021 7:08 AM] ProSavage#7131
I can do my degree in less time


[09/21/2021 7:08 AM] ProSavage#7131
I just dont do lectures and learn through projects


[09/21/2021 7:08 AM] ProSavage#7131
and homework


[09/21/2021 7:08 AM] Elemental#9509
honestly


[09/21/2021 7:08 AM] Elemental#9509
they just waste our time üòÇ


[09/21/2021 7:09 AM] ProSavage#7131
online school just meant I got to do like 3 classes in summer too


[09/21/2021 7:09 AM] ProSavage#7131
its stressful


[09/21/2021 7:09 AM] ProSavage#7131
but its really fast and no daily time commitment


[09/21/2021 7:09 AM] Elemental#9509
it's like literally just explain it to us once, give us the final quiz, and we'll all be done with the course by the end of the day


[09/21/2021 7:09 AM] ProSavage#7131
i mean u need to learn it


[09/21/2021 7:09 AM] ProSavage#7131
its just that online many people will give me a good explanation


[09/21/2021 7:09 AM] ProSavage#7131
my professors exist for me to answer questions


[09/21/2021 7:10 AM] ProSavage#7131
Im pretty honest tat I havent been paying too much attention in lectures to them, and tell them here is what i figured out on my own


[09/21/2021 7:10 AM] ProSavage#7131
and ask for help


[09/21/2021 7:10 AM] ProSavage#7131
I go to office hours but not class


[09/21/2021 7:10 AM] ProSavage#7131
I went to office hours a lot when I took assembly programming


[09/21/2021 7:10 AM] ProSavage#7131
:KEKW:


[09/21/2021 7:10 AM] ProSavage#7131
I hated assembly


[09/21/2021 7:11 AM] Elemental#9509
I don't blame you lol


[09/21/2021 7:11 AM] Marty#4039
pro are you pplns or prop


[09/21/2021 7:11 AM] ProSavage#7131
PPLNS 1.5mil shares.


[09/21/2021 7:12 AM] ProSavage#7131
oh right


[09/21/2021 7:12 AM] ProSavage#7131
another point


[09/21/2021 7:12 AM] Marty#4039
how many days is 1.5M


[09/21/2021 7:12 AM] ProSavage#7131
we need to explore more databases


[09/21/2021 7:12 AM] ProSavage#7131
eh like 2-3


[09/21/2021 7:12 AM] Elemental#9509
when's the last time your pool found a block?


[09/21/2021 7:12 AM] Elemental#9509
nvm just found that section


[09/21/2021 7:12 AM] Marty#4039
wdym explore more databases


[09/21/2021 7:12 AM] ProSavage#7131
go https://enigmapool.com/blocks


[09/21/2021 7:12 AM] Marty#4039
for enigma?


[09/21/2021 7:12 AM] ProSavage#7131
idk find higher perf databases for what I do


[09/21/2021 7:12 AM] ProSavage#7131
yeah


[09/21/2021 7:12 AM] ProSavage#7131
Im doing mongodb rn


[09/21/2021 7:12 AM] ProSavage#7131
nosql is great at data aggregation


[09/21/2021 7:12 AM] Marty#4039
have you used postgres


[09/21/2021 7:13 AM] Marty#4039
i'm learning it rn


[09/21/2021 7:13 AM] ProSavage#7131
since I need to take raw data all the time and do math with it


[09/21/2021 7:13 AM] ProSavage#7131

this is for payouts.


[09/21/2021 7:15 AM] ProSavage#7131
javascript is dogshit performance so I just tell database to do any hard work


[09/21/2021 7:15 AM] ProSavage#7131
my javascript just does mostly linear code, no massive loop compute


[09/21/2021 7:15 AM] Marty#4039
this is typescript?


[09/21/2021 7:15 AM] ProSavage#7131

[09/21/2021 7:17 AM] Elemental#9509
doesn't sound bad though tbh lol


[09/21/2021 7:17 AM] Marty#4039
i actually did a lot of those things client side when i was quikcly building the website


[09/21/2021 7:18 AM] Marty#4039
but you can use fastapi and postgres and do it all in the backend


[09/21/2021 7:18 AM] Marty#4039
then provide api endpoints with it alread figured out

I do that because I dont wanna send all the raw data


[09/21/2021 7:18 AM] Marty#4039
just do an async call and present the data


[09/21/2021 7:18 AM] Elemental#9509
this is all i see


[09/21/2021 7:18 AM] ProSavage#7131
the settings button


[09/21/2021 7:18 AM] Elemental#9509
i don't see a "settings button"


[09/21/2021 7:18 AM] ProSavage#7131

I can make it glow


[09/21/2021 7:18 AM] Marty#4039
flash and move

:bitelips:


[09/21/2021 7:19 AM] ProSavage#7131
is my block bounty explanation good enough?


[09/21/2021 7:19 AM] ProSavage#7131
thats the new feature


[09/21/2021 7:20 AM] ProSavage#7131
also join mah pool smh


[09/21/2021 7:20 AM] Elemental#9509
So from my understanding, the more shares you contribute until the block is found, the higher the percentage of that block reward you get, correct?


[09/21/2021 7:20 AM] ProSavage#7131
well


[09/21/2021 7:20 AM] ProSavage#7131
as long as its in last 1.5 mil


[09/21/2021 7:20 AM] Marty#4039
"you will be given a percentage equal to the contribution percentage for your wallet."


[09/21/2021 7:20 AM] ProSavage#7131
yeah we degen gambling hehe


[09/21/2021 7:21 AM] Marty#4039
so if you donate 1% of your profits, you get 1% of the 7 erg bounty?


[09/21/2021 7:21 AM] ProSavage#7131
the bounty leftover rolls to next block


[09/21/2021 7:21 AM] Elemental#9509
I just noticed some "block bounty configurations" are at 50% while others are at 0.5%


[09/21/2021 7:21 AM] ProSavage#7131
yeah


[09/21/2021 7:21 AM] ProSavage#7131
yea


[09/21/2021 7:21 AM] Marty#4039
who gets the rest


[09/21/2021 7:21 AM] ProSavage#7131
its because I didnt announce it yet


[09/21/2021 7:21 AM] ProSavage#7131
the next miner


[09/21/2021 7:21 AM] ProSavage#7131
it rolls over to next block


[09/21/2021 7:21 AM] ProSavage#7131
so


[09/21/2021 7:21 AM] Marty#4039
oh so it slowly grows


[09/21/2021 7:21 AM] Marty#4039
i see


[09/21/2021 7:21 AM] ProSavage#7131
yeah


[09/21/2021 7:21 AM] ProSavage#7131
inb4 50erg


[09/21/2021 7:21 AM] Marty#4039
lol


[09/21/2021 7:21 AM] ProSavage#7131
literally possible


[09/21/2021 7:21 AM] Elemental#9509
oh


[09/21/2021 7:21 AM] Elemental#9509
that's an interesting setup tbh


[09/21/2021 7:21 AM] ProSavage#7131
yeah its a gambling feature


[09/21/2021 7:21 AM] ProSavage#7131
u can just do 0% and mine for free.


[09/21/2021 7:22 AM] Marty#4039
i just gotta pay off the investment


[09/21/2021 7:22 AM] Elemental#9509
i could literally just put 100% and a minute later, a block is found


[09/21/2021 7:22 AM] ProSavage#7131
you dont have to particapate


[09/21/2021 7:22 AM] ProSavage#7131
yea, you could


[09/21/2021 7:22 AM] Elemental#9509
would that mean I get 100% of the block? :happe:


[09/21/2021 7:22 AM] ProSavage#7131
no


[09/21/2021 7:22 AM] Elemental#9509
you make me sad


[09/21/2021 7:22 AM] ProSavage#7131
100% of ur earnings + 100% of bounty


[09/21/2021 7:22 AM] ProSavage#7131
so if ur like 2GH


[09/21/2021 7:22 AM] ProSavage#7131
its like a 14 ergo reward


[09/21/2021 7:23 AM] Marty#4039
anyway check out using postgres/fastapi as your back end


[09/21/2021 7:23 AM] ProSavage#7131
u keep if u find a block


[09/21/2021 7:23 AM] Elemental#9509
The "invalid" amount might be broken btw

[09/21/2021 7:23 AM] ProSavage#7131
oh its just a frontend bug


[09/21/2021 7:23 AM] ProSavage#7131
my dumbass has a if statement if it's 0


[09/21/2021 7:23 AM] ProSavage#7131
it shows preloader


[09/21/2021 7:23 AM] ProSavage#7131
i fix soon


[09/21/2021 7:24 AM] Elemental#9509
oh. so I have to be the one to find the block, to receive it's rewards?


[09/21/2021 7:24 AM] ProSavage#7131
to recieve bounty


[09/21/2021 7:24 AM] ProSavage#7131
if u dont find it u get normal rewards


[09/21/2021 7:24 AM] ProSavage#7131
as u would


[09/21/2021 7:24 AM] Elemental#9509
oh


[09/21/2021 7:24 AM] ProSavage#7131
its a normal mining pool if u dont do block contribution


[09/21/2021 7:24 AM] ProSavage#7131
yeah i mean u dont have to do the gambling


[09/21/2021 7:24 AM] ProSavage#7131
lol


[09/21/2021 7:24 AM] Elemental#9509
yeah i thought i was being scammed for a sec üòÇ


[09/21/2021 7:25 AM] Marty#4039
https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql


[09/21/2021 7:25 AM] ProSavage#7131
does it have caching


[09/21/2021 7:25 AM] Marty#4039
you can add that


[09/21/2021 7:25 AM] ProSavage#7131
like I have litte background tasks


[09/21/2021 7:25 AM] ProSavage#7131
that cache into redis


[09/21/2021 7:25 AM] ProSavage#7131
then te frontend pulls it


[09/21/2021 7:25 AM] Marty#4039
you could have them manually add it


[09/21/2021 7:25 AM] ProSavage#7131
because some data takes like a few sec to compute


[09/21/2021 7:25 AM] Marty#4039
err not manually


[09/21/2021 7:25 AM] ProSavage#7131
yea


[09/21/2021 7:25 AM] Marty#4039
but you could write the code to have them add it


[09/21/2021 7:25 AM] ProSavage#7131
idk im just using express


[09/21/2021 7:26 AM] Marty#4039
good enough though, those backend tasks arent time sensitive really


[09/21/2021 7:26 AM] ProSavage#7131
I also have timeseries database


[09/21/2021 7:26 AM] ProSavage#7131
for hashrate charts


[09/21/2021 7:26 AM] Marty#4039
you've obviously got the stratum server and node running on its own server right?


[09/21/2021 7:27 AM] ProSavage#7131
yeah


[09/21/2021 7:27 AM] Marty#4039
so you can do all the data processing and website on another server and performance isn't an issue


[09/21/2021 7:27 AM] ProSavage#7131
yeah


[09/21/2021 7:27 AM] ProSavage#7131

rest api is designed to be replicated in all regions


[09/21/2021 7:27 AM] ProSavage#7131
I havent gotten to deploying that yet


[09/21/2021 7:28 AM] ProSavage#7131
waiting for k8s


[09/21/2021 7:28 AM] Marty#4039
that's where fastapi would be perfect


[09/21/2021 7:28 AM] Marty#4039
with the postgres database


[09/21/2021 7:28 AM] ProSavage#7131
oh I just wrote a simple setup


[09/21/2021 7:28 AM] ProSavage#7131
so


[09/21/2021 7:28 AM] ProSavage#7131
I've got a master-worker that calculates all data for people every 1 min


[09/21/2021 7:28 AM] ProSavage#7131
and then pushes it to redis in each server cluster


[09/21/2021 7:28 AM] ProSavage#7131
then the server pulls data in local redis


[09/21/2021 7:28 AM] Marty#4039
you have a redis db, mongodb, and a third one?


[09/21/2021 7:28 AM] ProSavage#7131
no


[09/21/2021 7:29 AM] ProSavage#7131
Ive got a redis in the rest api server


[09/21/2021 7:29 AM] ProSavage#7131
so


[09/21/2021 7:29 AM] Marty#4039
oh ok gotcha


[09/21/2021 7:29 AM] ProSavage#7131
restapi * instances + stratum * instances


[09/21/2021 7:29 AM] ProSavage#7131
each server has a redis


[09/21/2021 7:30 AM] Marty#4039
honestly running a pool is not simple


[09/21/2021 7:30 AM] ProSavage#7131
yeah


[09/21/2021 7:30 AM] Marty#4039
the scope is really big


[09/21/2021 7:30 AM] ProSavage#7131
rn I can handle ~2th


[09/21/2021 7:30 AM] ProSavage#7131
but it can scale better


[09/21/2021 7:30 AM] Elemental#9509
seems pretty simple


[09/21/2021 7:30 AM] ProSavage#7131
im getting there


[09/21/2021 7:30 AM] Elemental#9509
only issue is setting it up üòÇ


[09/21/2021 7:30 AM] Marty#4039
lol says the guy who can't setup a dns record


[09/21/2021 7:30 AM] ProSavage#7131
yea kekw


[09/21/2021 7:30 AM] Elemental#9509
nah ik how to do the dns record


[09/21/2021 7:30 AM] ProSavage#7131
it depends on how u do it I guess esot


[09/21/2021 7:30 AM] Elemental#9509
i just don't know how to point my sever to cloudflare üòÇ


[09/21/2021 7:31 AM] ProSavage#7131
I want it to scale easily


[09/21/2021 7:31 AM] ProSavage#7131
so its a lot of upfront work


[09/21/2021 7:31 AM] Marty#4039
yeah like any good full stack app, it's a lot in the beginning, then super simple to operate (if you do it right)


[09/21/2021 7:31 AM] Marty#4039
but that's why its fun


[09/21/2021 7:32 AM] ProSavage#7131
yeah


[09/21/2021 7:32 AM] ProSavage#7131
its really interesting


[09/21/2021 7:32 AM] ProSavage#7131
ive never done a microservice or event driven


[09/21/2021 7:32 AM] ProSavage#7131
its been a lot of research and programming


[09/21/2021 7:32 AM] ProSavage#7131
but pretty damn cool


[09/21/2021 7:32 AM] ProSavage#7131
v1 is gonna be me perfecting architecture


[09/21/2021 7:32 AM] ProSavage#7131
then rebuilding it in go, rust, or elixir for v2


[09/21/2021 7:32 AM] Marty#4039
nice


[09/21/2021 7:32 AM] ProSavage#7131
arch over language speed


[09/21/2021 7:33 AM] ProSavage#7131
lang speed is just per processor


[09/21/2021 7:33 AM] Marty#4039
tons of work but you'll be able to work anywhere after all that


[09/21/2021 7:33 AM] Marty#4039
or build any concept you come up wtih


[09/21/2021 7:33 AM] ProSavage#7131
yeah


[09/21/2021 7:33 AM] ProSavage#7131
I really like doing this


[09/21/2021 7:33 AM] ProSavage#7131
idrc for the coding part


[09/21/2021 7:33 AM] ProSavage#7131
its fun to design


[09/21/2021 7:34 AM] Marty#4039
project managers don't write much code


[09/21/2021 7:34 AM] Marty#4039
i'm gonna get back to work, good chatting with you both


[09/21/2021 7:35 AM] Marty#4039
btw you don't need to do that


[09/21/2021 7:35 AM] Marty#4039
just run whatever dynamic dns software windows has, and use an A+ record


[09/21/2021 7:36 AM] Marty#4039
or follow the cloudflare docs, they're easy too


[09/21/2021 7:36 AM] Elemental#9509
Me: * currently reading about how to point it to cloud flare *
ecot: "yeah don't do that"


[09/21/2021 7:36 AM] Marty#4039
hahahah i said you don't need to do it that way


[09/21/2021 7:36 AM] Marty#4039
keep reading. cloudflare is good too


[09/21/2021 7:36 AM] Marty#4039
good luck. take care homes


[09/21/2021 7:37 AM] ProSavage#7131
U using windows server?


[09/21/2021 7:37 AM] ProSavage#7131
Lol


[09/21/2021 7:37 AM] ProSavage#7131
Linux ftw


[09/21/2021 7:37 AM] Elemental#9509
considering idk nor trust any dynamic dns software, I think I'll just stick with cloudflare for now


[09/21/2021 7:38 AM] ProSavage#7131
What even is ur pool


[09/21/2021 7:38 AM] ProSavage#7131
Do u have a Frontend


[09/21/2021 7:38 AM] ProSavage#7131
A backend that processes and stores shares?


[09/21/2021 7:40 AM] Elemental#9509
just for testing purposes for now. I plan to set it up via linux once I figure it all out and have a better understanding of this

[09/21/2021 7:44 AM] ProSavage#7131
Ur just testing


[09/21/2021 7:44 AM] ProSavage#7131
Just test it with ur own hardware on number up


[09/21/2021 7:45 AM] Elemental#9509
correct


[09/21/2021 7:45 AM] ProSavage#7131
Why do u care about a record

It takes five minutes


[09/21/2021 7:45 AM] Elemental#9509
I managed to get my rig (on 2nd pc) to connect to the pool on my main pc already


[09/21/2021 7:45 AM] ProSavage#7131
Ok


[09/21/2021 7:45 AM] Elemental#9509
I just wanna figure out the non numeric ip part lol


[09/21/2021 7:45 AM] ProSavage#7131
I use ngrok to locally test my code


[09/21/2021 7:46 AM] ProSavage#7131
Go register domain on cloud late


[09/21/2021 7:46 AM] ProSavage#7131
Then go make a A record and make sure the little cloud is gray


[09/21/2021 7:46 AM] Elemental#9509
i wanna be able to put stratum+tcp://miningpool.com:1000 instead of my ip4 address üòÇ


[09/21/2021 7:46 AM] ProSavage#7131
Put server ip in the box


[09/21/2021 7:46 AM] ProSavage#7131
Be done


[09/21/2021 7:49 AM] Elemental#9509

[09/21/2021 7:49 AM] Elemental#9509
The numeric ip is different. I just changed it rn for this example


[09/21/2021 7:49 AM] Elemental#9509
cloud was gray in this example before I set the ip to that


[09/21/2021 7:50 AM] ProSavage#7131
are u dumn


[09/21/2021 7:51 AM] Elemental#9509
yes


[09/21/2021 7:51 AM] ProSavage#7131
no point in hiding numeric ip


[09/21/2021 7:51 AM] ProSavage#7131
ur not gonna proxy


[09/21/2021 7:51 AM] ProSavage#7131
it just resolves to the nmeric ip anyways


[09/21/2021 7:51 AM] Elemental#9509
What's wrong with having it proxied?


[09/21/2021 7:52 AM] Elemental#9509
i disable it and it says it exposes the ip


[09/21/2021 7:52 AM] ProSavage#7131
Omg


[09/21/2021 7:52 AM] ProSavage#7131
It‚Äôs a tcp socket


[09/21/2021 7:52 AM] ProSavage#7131
It‚Äôs not a http call


[09/21/2021 7:52 AM] ProSavage#7131
It stays alive


[09/21/2021 7:52 AM] Elemental#9509
right


[09/21/2021 7:52 AM] ProSavage#7131
Cloudflare only allows specific amount of concurrent tcp connections


[09/21/2021 7:52 AM] ProSavage#7131
I think like 10 when proxies


[09/21/2021 7:53 AM] ProSavage#7131
So if u wanna max at 10 miners, or pay 5k+ for enterprise


[09/21/2021 7:53 AM] Elemental#9509
hmm


[09/21/2021 7:53 AM] Elemental#9509
those 10 miners do sound really promising though


[09/21/2021 7:53 AM] Elemental#9509
:pepeOK:


[09/21/2021 11:45 PM] Elemental#9509
Yeah I have no idea how to point my pool to my website. Can't seem to find anything helpful online either


[09/22/2021 3:22 AM] Elemental#9509
@Marty Did you just delete your msg rn?


[09/22/2021 3:28 AM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
How does your website connect to your pool?  Cloud or on prem?


[09/22/2021 3:32 AM] Elemental#9509
That's what I'm trying to figure out. I was following little Esot's guide rn but someone deleted it


[09/22/2021 3:33 AM] Elemental#9509
My goal is to create an official pool (not just for me), which is why I've been focusing a ton of time on trying to get the non-numeric ip setup
(Also, I'm obviously not gonna release it to the public right away. I'm just trying to figure it all out rn, as well as clean up the code and have my bud test it for me, before i switch it over to linux)


[09/22/2021 6:15 AM] CryptoMinerOS#1745
Do you know how DNS works?
Do you already have your own domain name? 
You basically just need to create an A record pointing to your IP address. That's it. 

Steps:
1. Get domain.
2. Add an A record that is pointing to your IP address.
3. Wait for a few minutes and you should be able to access the domain.

The steps to add an a record depends on your registrar.


[09/22/2021 6:21 AM] Elemental#9509
Just bought the domain today. Currently pointing to cloudflare but I gotta setup the A record. Also, for the ip, you're referring to my static ip, correct?


[09/22/2021 6:22 AM] CryptoMinerOS#1745
yes


[09/22/2021 6:22 AM] CryptoMinerOS#1745
the ip that your stratum server is using.


[09/22/2021 6:22 AM] Elemental#9509
I was honestly really confused before when I was told to change my ip to a static ip but my ip already doesn't change, and has dhcp enabled so that threw me off a bit originally


[09/22/2021 6:23 AM] Elemental#9509
Also, my mining rig points to my ip4 address of my gaming pc. (The one that starts with 192.168)


[09/22/2021 6:27 AM] CryptoMinerOS#1745
Your stratum server is in your gaming PC?


[09/22/2021 6:28 AM] Elemental#9509
For the time being, yes. I'm currently just testing it all on my gaming pc so I have a better understanding of setting the official project up


[09/22/2021 6:29 AM] CryptoMinerOS#1745
if that's the case then you might also need to set some port forwarding so that the stratum server can be accessed publicly. Or you can still set the 192.168 address on the dns 
 just for testing but only you(your miner) can access it.


[09/22/2021 6:32 AM] Elemental#9509
Yeah I already managed to get my mining rig to connect to my gaming pc and mine (using my pc's ip4 address) . Now I'm trying to setup the domain and stuff to allow my bud to connect to it


[09/22/2021 6:32 AM] Elemental#9509
Also, I tried setting up port forwarding on my router but it doesn't seem to wanna work for some reason. It just doesn't save


[09/22/2021 6:32 AM] Elemental#9509
I might have to contact my internet provider for that


[09/22/2021 6:33 AM] Elemental#9509
Which I will do tomorrow


[09/22/2021 8:42 AM] Elemental#9509

[09/22/2021 6:18 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I've been swamped...thanks for input on the open source pool, I'll try to work on this some more in next few weeks.  Goal is to have something pretty straightforward so that anyone can setup a pool with minimal effort.  Much of the hard work is done with stratum and node work, and my previous attempt to convert nomp is entirely converted to Python.  I may work on converting stratum or at least handle miners, which I have done some work on, unfortunately fastapi doesn't support tcp streams, so I've left it out for now.


[09/22/2021 10:29 PM] keiser1080#0143
i am nearly ready to try your opensource poll, still busy on some gpu tuning.
I will continue to send you a feedback.
for tcp stream i am pretty sure you can found something to do that using twisted.

[09/22/2021 10:50 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
Twisted may be the best way to go...I got a class based solution partway with just sockets...not sure how much of the twisted library I would use since the communication is pretty simple


[09/22/2021 10:53 PM] keiser1080#0143
if you have no experience with twisted, check some example it's very different from other python library

@Leif Erickson 
i have started the ergo startum server from your repo.
but i am unable to mine from hiveos teamredminer pointing to stratum+tcp://mydomain.com:8008
on the ergostratum container log i see:
debug: [Unknown stratum method from (unauthorized)
update dont forget to chose autolykos


[09/23/2021 4:16 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I have also found TRM to have issues.  I've tested a little and it seems to be an issue when connected directory to the stratum server (mine or sam's), and why I kinda paused working on this cause I think the next step will require building a miner manner that basically reverse proxies the information from the miner to the stratum.  This additional control is actually ideal, it's also a bit more complex to implement


[09/23/2021 4:54 PM] andee#4722
have checked what method TRM is sending that is unexpected?


[09/23/2021 5:25 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
I dug in a little and have had some generous help, but I don't have a great AMD test setup currently.  It seems to think that the first solution is valid and resubmits right away and bonks pretty quick for invalids by the server


[09/23/2021 5:50 PM] Pulsarz#9208
I think flypool (ethermine) had the same problem


[09/23/2021 5:50 PM] Pulsarz#9208
they fixed it 1-2 days ago


[09/23/2021 5:50 PM] Pulsarz#9208
trm gave a lot of double share submissions in their case


[09/23/2021 5:50 PM] Pulsarz#9208

I imagine setting up a manager to handle miner connections and standardize the interaction is common.  I'm not sure this is true, but something i think would be useful also to handle security and performance


[09/23/2021 10:29 PM] keiser1080#0143
what miner do you recomand , i mean which one is work with ergo stratum and ergotulip ?


[09/24/2021 12:46 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
nbminer if you're using AMD, trex for Nvidia, but thats just my personal pref.  Trex tends to mine at least 1% better than the others making their dev fee a no brainer, plus being a dev I like to support that and it tends to make a better overall product when it's incentivize imho

I honestly do not know. I am actually not the one that got our pool in there in the first place. I just pushed an update for ergo and it was accepted. Maybe there are additional checks when adding a new pool as opposed to updating.


[09/25/2021 11:09 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Hey everyone.  Trying to connect to my ergo node via the ergo stratum proxy. I know it is built right because I can connect to any pool (ie. herominer) however getting some funky json token error.  Anyone seen this and know how to correct?

Apprarently that proxy isn't required


[09/25/2021 11:10 PM] Elemental#9509
You only need the Node and the StratumServer


[09/25/2021 11:11 PM] Elemental#9509
Also, are you trying to connect from a separate pc/rig? or are you mining on the pc the node is on?


[09/25/2021 11:11 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Ok.  I was looking into the server as next steps.


[09/25/2021 11:11 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Same for now


[09/25/2021 11:13 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Why something different if I go through desperate pc?   I thought that‚Äôs what the server stratum was for


[09/25/2021 11:14 PM] Elemental#9509
@√Ör√ñhB√™ Have you already configured your start.js file in the stratum folder?


[09/25/2021 11:14 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Yes


[09/25/2021 11:15 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
But again was focused on the proxy


[09/25/2021 11:15 PM] Elemental#9509
as far as I'm aware, the proxy is irrelevant


[09/25/2021 11:17 PM] Elemental#9509
But if you want the proxy to connect, you need both the node and stratum open/running first (Pretty sure the node needs to be fully synced as well)


[09/25/2021 11:17 PM] Elemental#9509
Let me know if you get the same error


[09/25/2021 11:18 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Ok thanks.  I will build the server and report back.


[09/27/2021 7:28 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289

[10/08/2021 8:16 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
The higher the difficulty, the harder it is to get shares.  Your difficulty should never be above the network difficulty, and if it is the same then mining a share is the same thing as mining the block, as if you were solo mining.  Shares are a pool concept and not required something the blockchain tracks.


[10/08/2021 3:16 PM] -[Art e fakt]-#3785
then it doesn't matter how high the difficult is. it just must not be higher than the network difficulty. But that is certainly not the rule. can you recommend me a value?


[10/08/2021 3:19 PM] -[Art e fakt]-#3785
I only want to do solo mining with it


[10/10/2021 10:31 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
For solo mining, I wouldn't worry about setting difficulty or shares. Shares are only relevant for pools.  I would just setup the node and stratum server and connect directly to the stratum server.  Perhaps a dev has a better solution, although this one is pretty well documented.

[10/15/2021 11:08 PM] keiser1080#0143
The key must be created thought de API.
There is an endpoint you can access without a key to generate the key based on a text.


[10/16/2021 12:59 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
@keiser1080 the key was generated using swagger. It just seems like the  scores{} is just not being applied to the ergo.conf (even though its in there). Could this be somehow permission issues? This is my second node and seems identical to the first one but can't get the  API key hash working.


[10/16/2021 1:01 AM] andee#4722
check the output when starting the node


[10/16/2021 1:14 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
I think it was permissions because even though the node started I've never seen ergo.log to be created, had to mod user priv since running as systemctl, as always @andee I appreciate help!


[10/16/2021 1:35 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
never mind still same issue, scores{} mod with new hash but node still takes old "hello" to access panel, strange, like its not taking the new config from that ergo.conf but using some cache. May need to build from scratch again...Only workaround was to create brand new ergo.conf and rerun script to take an effect. Strange cache.


[10/16/2021 9:32 AM] andee#4722
you have a problem with how you are running it, the node is not caching the config

Looks like there is a critical build failure deep within the the multi-hashing library. What's most interesting to me is the amount of build requirements each of these packages actually requires.


[10/19/2021 11:22 PM] Aquaritek#9015

Step 2: open CMD or PS and run: npm install npm@latest -g

Step 3: install Visual Studio: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/
During the installation make sure that you check the box for "Desktop Development C++" if you already have VS installed you can modify the install to include those packages.

Step 4: Install OpenSSL: https://slproweb.com/download/Win64OpenSSL-1_1_1L.msi
During the install make sure you install it to C:\OpenSSL-Win64
After install is complete open CMD as admin and perform the following
cd C:\OpenSSL-Win64\lib
then
mklink libeay32.lib libcrypto.lib

Step 5: install git for windows https://git-scm.com/download/win use defaults during install

Step 6: install python https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/
If you install python development packages with Visual Studio you can skip this one.
 
Step 7: While in CMD browse to the root ErgoStratumServer-master folder wherever you have it and 
npm update

This will take awhile

Step 8: node start.js

Note: You may need to restart at least once after VS install or just for kicks restart after you have everything installed.

Sorry I had to edit that a couple of times. I'm pretty sure that's everything you need to make it work. Hunting down all the errors is what took the longest lol. This should be in the Readme.md honestly.


[10/21/2021 12:40 AM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
You rock.  Will work on it in a bit and let you know


[10/21/2021 12:46 AM] Aquaritek#9015
I think we should just host the node modules folder complete in that repo lol


[10/21/2021 12:46 AM] Aquaritek#9015
In fact if you continue to have issues I bet I could just shoot you the zip.


[10/21/2021 12:50 AM] Aquaritek#9015
There was one last thing I missed which went in as step 6 totally forgot about python lol. I had it with VS already but you will need it.


[10/21/2021 1:08 AM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Cool, let me try to build from your guide and if I cant Ill just take the zip


[10/21/2021 1:09 AM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
on node.js did you use LTS or current?


[10/21/2021 2:07 AM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Got a funky error.  Some reason trying to link it back to a mining software I was using at one point.  Seems to be conflicting with another build.  Any thoughts?

[10/21/2021 3:15 AM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
I was able to get around that error.  For some reason, I had an old build for the NV miner and it kept pointing to that.   At one point I moved that folder out of my Ergo main folder just to keep it separate.  I put it back in the right directory as it called out and the error went away


[10/21/2021 3:15 AM] Aquaritek#9015
Nice!


[10/21/2021 3:16 AM] Aquaritek#9015
Now you need to let me know if you can get difficulty on the running stratum instance working correctly ha!


[10/21/2021 3:16 AM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Now I need to relocate my SSL folder and hope it doesn't mess up some of my other builds

just as challenging IMO


[10/21/2021 2:14 PM] andee#4722
easy when used to it like most things, with the stratum server a `npm update` was enough


[10/21/2021 2:25 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
I originally started building this in Ubuntu.  Took me a bit but got through the npm update with a little help.   This is where I got stuck on that build.

This is the line holding you back:
138 error C:\Users\rkowi\AppData\Local\node-gyp\Cache\17.0.1\include\node\openssl\macros.h(155,1): fatal error C1189: #error:  "OPENSSL_API_COMPAT expresses an impossible API compatibility level" [Z:\Mining\ErgoStratumServer\node_modules\bignum\build\bignum.vcxproj]

There is definitely something wrong with the openssl installation. You said you were using it for other project builds but I'm wondering if a uninstall and reinstall following step 4 back in my message would get it to work.


[10/21/2021 5:24 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
On the windows build, I followed step 4 on top off what I already had loaded as it was a different version and saved on an externa drive.  Possibly they are still conflicting.  Let me try uninstall and re-installing to only one version and see if that helps


[10/21/2021 5:25 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Any thoughts on this error in Ubuntu?


[10/21/2021 6:14 PM] Aquaritek#9015
I haven't run into any syntax violations on my end. I would think something is going wrong with an import statement. However, the line it's throwing on is very strange. Are you using LTS node.js on your ubuntu instance?


[10/21/2021 6:32 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
I back peddled and started all over.  Seemed it  was conflicting like crazy, so I just reset.  Half way through the build now\


[10/21/2021 7:07 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Got it! Just need a fresh start.  Thanks @Aquaritek   Connected to the standard config pool.  Now need to build my config.

Haha yes, 
First run was 1MH diff and I basically DDOSed myself with a single 3060ti then I altered the values for the configuration and it changed difficulty to 712.15TH and I can't get it to send my miner anything different. I don't think I'll ever submit a single share HA!

Alright, who here is running Stratum server on linux, instead of Windows?  running into issue with connecting to a node, whereas the windows node.js stratum version connects fine to same node.

[10/25/2021 7:09 AM] andee#4722
did you run the server or the proxy on windows?


[10/25/2021 7:11 AM] andee#4722
the proxy is for the open source miners, if you are setting up a pool you need the server


[10/25/2021 2:38 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
I have the pool setup, working fine with a windows-based stratum proxy server. I am trying to setup the stratum proxy server on Ubuntu, but lacks a configuration file which is not documented.  While the windows-based version has the node.js with all the config settings.


[10/25/2021 2:54 PM] andee#4722
if you intend on sending shares you need the server, not the proxy


[10/25/2021 4:03 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
The proxy is needed for miner connectivity.  Already have the server (ergo node).


[10/25/2021 4:04 PM] andee#4722
you dont use the proxy in a pool setup. you need a stratum server that is connected to the node


[10/25/2021 4:04 PM] andee#4722
the proxy is for connecting the open source miners to a stratum server


[10/25/2021 4:07 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273

it say provided 1 even we provide  1 diff 40diff 400diff or 4million diff

try 4B


[10/30/2021 9:16 PM] ProSavage#7131
if you are using the difficulty feature in ergostratumserver reference, that is all wrong


[10/30/2021 9:16 PM] ProSavage#7131
diff is the inverse 2^256 of the target


[10/30/2021 9:16 PM] ProSavage#7131
the reference just uses a "multiplier"


[10/30/2021 9:17 PM] ProSavage#7131
so this multiplier is a horrible way to do this because it is being multipled by network diff.... a value that changes each epoch


[11/02/2021 8:10 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
For multiple nodes in a single mining pool, is the back end architecture simply sharing the data directory between nodes? Or do the nodes operate independently from the stratum infrastructure?


[11/02/2021 8:16 PM] andee#4722
node and stratum server for each deployed region is optimal


[11/02/2021 9:26 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Do nodes have to share the history, state, and wallet state folders?


[11/02/2021 9:27 PM] andee#4722
no, that could get messy


[11/02/2021 9:27 PM] andee#4722
restore using the same mnemonic on all nodes though


[11/02/2021 9:28 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273

I looked online and found that if i dropped my node version down to 10 it would solve it, which it has. It's running now however it isn't showing any network hashrate or diff

Hello, I need your help ! 
I've encountered  issues in ergo mining. 
I succeeded mining for a week on testnet where I received shares and could calculate their difficulty (= share difficulty found by mining software). Everything looked pretty fine.

Though, on Mainnet, when I tried to mine... The shares I received, then converted to a human readable difficulty appear to be most of the time : 1, 2 or 3 instead of 400 000 as previously set with the exact same methods. 

I can convert the b (network difficulty) to a human readable value, that is relevant according to localhost:9053/info ...
Is there any difference between testnet mining and mainnet mining ? 

Thank you by advance !

Node specs, for initial sync I recommend 4 cpu and 16GB of memory. Once its synchronized, 2 cpu 8 gb is fine, possibly less

Hello everyone.  Does anyone here has experience running an Ergo pool? - I‚Äôm a bit stuck interpreting localhost:9052/mining/candidate vs localhost:9052/mining/submit


[11/22/2021 8:00 PM] ProSavage#7131
Candidate is a block you try and solve, and submit is once you solved it


[11/22/2021 9:52 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
Thank you for that information üôèüèº  Im looking at the function signatures, and /candidate sends ‚Äúmsg‚Äù, ‚Äúpk‚Äù, ‚Äúb‚Äù, ‚Äúh‚Äù.   The /submit requires ‚Äúw‚Äù ‚Äúpk‚Äù ‚Äún‚Äù , ‚Äúd‚Äù.   Do you know what each means?   In particular, w, b and d

[12/01/2021 4:18 PM] andee#4722
just asking the questions usually yields faster response, it also helps save time for the people answering since others will be able to search for the answer


[12/01/2021 4:21 PM] valentin#3849
Sure ! Here's the problem, I manage to find the share difficulty on testnet with a decent precision from big Int (fh)... but when I'm mining on mainnet the share difficulty is incoherent and very low, lolMiner sends shares above the pool difficulty Though... Why is it happening ? Is the method different ?


[12/01/2021 4:32 PM] andee#4722
have you checked the reference stratum? this is out of my knowledge, but getting low inconsistent numbers sounds like an overflow


[12/01/2021 4:32 PM] andee#4722
```        const fh = BigIntBuffer.toBigIntBE(blake2b(BigIntBuffer.toBufferBE(f, 32)));
        let blockHash = "";
        //Check if share is a block candidate (matched network difficulty)
        if (job.rpcData.b.gte(fh)) {
            // must submit solution
            blockHash = BigIntBuffer.toBufferBE(f, 32)
        } else {
            //Check if share didn't reached the miner's difficulty)
            if ((new BigNumber(job.jobParams[6])).multipliedBy(difficulty).lte(fh)) {
                return shareError([23, 'Low Difficulty share']);
            }
        }```


[12/01/2021 4:33 PM] valentin#3849
I based my work on this code. 
Then I used a BigToCompact (bigInt to uint32) method on the fh to apply finally a calcWork method


[12/01/2021 4:35 PM] valentin#3849
I reproduced all the code with the exact hex output


[12/01/2021 4:51 PM] valentin#3849
on the left my output, on the right the reference code : 
The solutions are the same, but I can't extract the human readable share difficulty...

[12/02/2021 6:31 PM] valentin#3849
So we can't compute a share difficulty ?


[12/02/2021 6:32 PM] valentin#3849
I mean we can send a difficulty to the miner, but we can't decode the difficulty embedded in the fh ?


[12/02/2021 7:01 PM] andee#4722
is it the share diff multiplier of 2^8 you are missing?


[12/02/2021 9:54 PM] valentin#3849
I'm using it on testnet, it works well


[12/02/2021 9:55 PM] valentin#3849
fh has a length of 68 most of the time with a pool diff of 1 billion on testnet 
On mainnet, fh is 77 characters long for the same pool diff


[12/02/2021 9:56 PM] valentin#3849
I guess that's one of the reasons I get a share diff of 1, 2, 10. 
Share difficulty of 1 means it meets the required difficulty of the pool ?


[12/05/2021 2:19 AM] ProSavage#7131
so you have the correct fh value right?


[12/05/2021 2:20 AM] valentin#3849
yes


[12/05/2021 2:20 AM] ProSavage#7131
get this lib called "bigint-buffer" for me


[12/05/2021 2:20 AM] ProSavage#7131
if you are using nodejs


[12/05/2021 2:20 AM] ProSavage#7131
const fh = BigIntBuffer.toBigIntBE(blake2b(BigIntBuffer.toBufferBE(f, 32)))


[12/05/2021 2:20 AM] valentin#3849
I'm using Go


[12/05/2021 2:20 AM] ProSavage#7131
const shareDiff = (BigInt(Math.pow(2, 256)) / fh)


[12/05/2021 2:20 AM] ProSavage#7131

Hi everyone, I would like to learn more about hosting a pool, are there any good documentation around? Thank you in advance!


[12/05/2021 4:57 AM] Adrarc#9751
I went back quiiite a while to check the older messages. If my understanding is correct, at the very very basic level: You set up a full ergo node on your pc, which is pretty easy to do. mining = true, and you find a way to make the domain available for others to join - you could use something like Stratum for that? is that right? And finally, having a website/webapp interface for it is a "bonus" in the sense that, as long as people mining know your address and port they will be mining on your node. Correct?


[12/05/2021 4:59 AM] Adrarc#9751
So this is the very first take-home that I got after ~haf an hour of reading and checking out the githubs etc.. Then, all the codes you guys are writting in the chat I am not exactly sure of their utilities at this point in time. Is it you trying to figure out how to connect web app with server/mining information from the backend? Or is it the node-mining itself? What are you guys trying to integrate?


[12/05/2021 4:59 AM] Adrarc#9751
And finally, would I have to quit my 9-5 for this lol


[12/05/2021 7:59 PM] ProSavage#7131
we're doing stratum code for mining, you need to use either a custom one or use ErgoStratumServer, however, you will need to code a website and all that yourself


[12/05/2021 8:02 PM] ProSavage#7131
It kinda CAN be fulltime job, I run https://enigmapool.com
It probably is if your pool grows very large, and you have to manage support etc.


[12/11/2021 11:57 AM] Adrarc#9751
Thanks a lot! I like your pool, might mine on it after my next reward. I am familiar with django for quite simple web apps - how do you make your app communicate with the pool to get the current hashrate, number of miners etc.. ?


[12/11/2021 5:14 PM] ProSavage#7131
So that‚Äôs really up to you, you can use a database


[12/11/2021 5:15 PM] ProSavage#7131
I store shares in database and my ‚Äúpool‚Äù reads the data to calculate hashrate etc


[12/11/2021 7:36 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Running a pool out of your pc may be a cool project but won‚Äôt get you far. You need to think about latency between miners all over the world ans your infrastructure, and the performance overhead.  Also finding blocks is a race to who submits it fastest, which all of the above takes an impact. You may find blocks but they are no good if you are late in submitting a candidate. So think about these factors to consider if the effort really is worth it for you.


[12/11/2021 8:09 PM] ProSavage#7131
Well it‚Äôs not exactly expensive - 5 bucks for a 1 cpu 1 gb VM around the world in digital ocean


[12/11/2021 8:09 PM] ProSavage#7131
Latency fixed, write the code so the stratum runs on there and do it in a distributed way


[12/11/2021 8:12 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
True but you won‚Äôt be running a node on 1 cpu and 1 gb ram.  Yes a stratum could but if you run a single node and multiple stratum, yes it will work but latency wins (stratum to node).


[12/11/2021 8:12 PM] ProSavage#7131
True, I did a stratum on one vm, and then got a 4gb ram one for node


[12/11/2021 8:12 PM] ProSavage#7131
Because the node is pretty heavy


[12/11/2021 8:13 PM] ProSavage#7131
So it was like 15$ I think + 5$


[12/11/2021 8:14 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Yeah unfortunately.


[12/11/2021 8:15 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
But I‚Äôm always a proponent for people to try.  Fosters innovation  and competition


[12/11/2021 8:16 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
with peer to peer once nodes get lightweight enough it can be shared and a reward mechanism established


[12/11/2021 8:16 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Right now node is too temperamental and dependent on environment


[12/11/2021 8:20 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Hola. Been off Discord for months. Is anybody running the miningcore implementation ERG sucesfully?


[12/11/2021 8:28 PM] andee#4722
yeah, for the lowest latency solution sadly both node and stratum have to run on the same server which will increase cost depending on the amount of regions. is there any benefit at all of having regions when there is only one central node?


[12/11/2021 8:35 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Reach


[12/11/2021 8:35 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
But you‚Äôll loose the race every time


[12/11/2021 8:35 PM] andee#4722
been some problems with rejected blocks all along, think it was caused by MC being on the previous block instead of the current


[12/11/2021 8:35 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Unless luck


[12/11/2021 8:35 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273

[12/11/2021 8:36 PM] andee#4722
wont miner > region stratum > central node have potential for more latency than miner > central node with stratum ?

This is what worries me. I can't afford anything buggy. the coin we listed to start with has just halved, it's killed profitability. I'm just doing this to avoid fees for myself, and cut down fees for my friends.

I think my next move is cloning my pool on another machine, then adding ERG and seeing what happens.


[12/11/2021 8:40 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
The bug fixes on  discord worry me, it makes me feel like ~I should wait.


[12/11/2021 8:41 PM] andee#4722
you could fire up a devnet and use cpu to test it out


[12/11/2021 8:41 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
github, not discord, sorry I;m drinking beer


[12/11/2021 8:41 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Yeah TBH this is the likely route. I'll set it up in a test environment, maybe ask for help, get, add existing coin and DB etc..


[12/11/2021 8:43 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Sorry I should come back to this seriously later, and I will. Out of principle we are keeping our hash on the coin we have listed but have agreed we need to add a new coin (ERG) within 14 days if nothing changes.


[12/11/2021 8:44 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
The main thing that worried isa  fellow pool opertator gave up on listing it completely, and i consider him smarter than me.


[12/11/2021 8:45 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Maybe I'm just being a pussy. I should probably just fire it up on a test server, but I feel comfortable in my world of pokemon and weed right now.


[12/11/2021 8:46 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I get odd anxiety about this type of thing. sounds harsh but Iu'd rather observe other [people go through all the isssue trhen add it when it;s sorted.


[12/11/2021 8:47 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Yeah tbh testnet is an obvious, between me and my friends we don;t have neough hashrate to kick off the pool IMHO


[12/11/2021 8:47 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
It will be a case of possibly seeding it in some way and then promoting it hard, if it fails it fails


[12/11/2021 8:49 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
If we can get enough hashrate though, so we are finding blocks at a reasonable rate, keeping the actual pool online 24/7 is no issue. I was scared at first to have other people's money, but we kept WD limits at a minimum etc.. and have maintained it easily for  many months now.

I can afford to bail out a fuck up on a small coin, with <100 miners, but not a high hashrate coin with >1000 miners


[12/11/2021 8:51 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
So far the worst I've ran into was a DB crash, which stopped one block from being paid out, had to do it manually. But other than that all issues have been minor.


[12/11/2021 8:53 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I've tried to keep it as local as possible, maybe I'm crazy but I feel people in the UK should be mining on a UK node,, etc.. I feel slight performance loss is possible if people don;t mine as local as posivle


[12/11/2021 9:03 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
This is a real consequence. Happened to us, had to put significant money out of pocket to retain trust due to bugs


[12/11/2021 9:10 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Yeah, I mean I know what I'm doing with nodes clones from bitcoin core, but not as confident around new stuff. I'll just have to give it a go, there is no other way to tackle it, just jump in the deep end.


[12/11/2021 9:12 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
My issue as well, is we don;t have anough hashrate between us to hit blocks fast. We can test on testnet but we need the pool to at least look active to stand a chance.


[12/11/2021 9:13 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
BTW, I'm super drunk and just going to shut up now. I shouldn't be trying to discuss this stuff on a sat night, my bad.

[12/12/2021 9:52 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Yeah same here, I have an unused HP z600 here though. I took a break from all this, have been mostly playing mariokart 8 and other switch games for the last 3 months. Now playing Pokemon BDSP.


[12/12/2021 9:52 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Yeah we are a little worried about that, between me and my friends we only have a few GH.


[12/12/2021 9:53 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Though we have some loyal miners on VTC.. but people are slowly dropping off now as the block rewqard halved, killinmg profit.. but the issue is so many people using the one click miner, and some bright spark hardcoded the block reward in, so the estimated coins, shown to miners is double what it should say if they havne;t updated yet.


[12/12/2021 9:56 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Is the block bug fix in the main miningcore build now?


[12/12/2021 9:57 AM] andee#4722

What are the advantages of hosting a ERG pool ?


[01/21/2022 10:03 PM] Strider#6512
If you host your own node, you will have a better latency to your workers if they are on the same network.


[01/28/2022 9:27 AM] cryptosafe#2323
Ahh I found the right sub group.. im needing exactily this I have the local node but I need to setup a stratum server so I can mine to my local node I do not wish to make a pool its just for me really and I want to be able to use NB miner to mine on the same rig that runs the node also for academy purposes I would love to learn how to setup a stratum server. Videos on youtube skip some parts and I ran into a error the one time I tried it had to fresh install my node to get back to square one 

Im willing to send ergo to anyone who can walk me through the stratum server setup as a thank you


[01/28/2022 9:37 AM] Strider#6512
If your node is synced, I can take you through the stratum setup.

I am setting up a new linux node and stratum right now as well, my Windows one just failed... go figure üòÑ


[01/28/2022 9:39 AM] cryptosafe#2323
Windows seems very buggy with ergos node I made alot of changes just to get the node to this point Im on windows though

I have another 160k blocks to sync.


[01/28/2022 9:39 AM] cryptosafe#2323
Oh you should be done by time i get back to the house

I had to go through several different forum posts to figure it out


[01/28/2022 9:44 AM] cryptosafe#2323
Your a life saver for sure the videos skipped things i think


[01/28/2022 9:45 AM] Strider#6512
also the github guide is missing a config entry thats present in ergo platform guide


[01/28/2022 9:48 AM] cryptosafe#2323
didnt know that i gave up hopes after it failed originaly and left it alone then 2 months later this week I went deep and setup my first full local node solo mine setup on another block chain but i wanted to take what I learned and do it for ergo. Now too


[01/28/2022 9:50 AM] cryptosafe#2323
Will using your method for stratum guve share information in NB Miner when I mine to my node?


[01/28/2022 9:55 AM] Strider#6512
How do you mean? Your node and stratum are on your end, you shouldn't need to share any information.


[01/28/2022 9:56 AM] Strider#6512
Do not share information on a public space with anyone. You will just need to edit the relevant sections and you will be good to go.


[01/28/2022 9:57 AM] cryptosafe#2323
Well thats for a future project I suppose then thats more for like a pool stratum I suppose?


[01/28/2022 9:58 AM] Strider#6512
Yeh I don't know how to make a pool though. Just enough to get both stratum and node working internally.


[01/28/2022 9:59 AM] Strider#6512
Setting up a pool to the otuside has security issues.


[01/28/2022 9:59 AM] cryptosafe#2323
Thats a hell of alot farther than I ever got so im thankful


[01/28/2022 10:00 AM] cryptosafe#2323
Yeah and its not my goals either im happy with local setup I was just curious about share information so I can easily diag if things are not working properly and utilize share check validation in NB miner when solo mining


[01/28/2022 10:08 AM] Strider#6512
Oh share information from the worker? I thought share information as in your own information üòÑ

{Reactions}
üòÜ 

[01/28/2022 10:10 AM] cryptosafe#2323
Lol no i meant like new jobs : difficulties of jobs fron I belive is called rpc daemon and not sure what constitutes how NB miner says (share accepted ) but id like it to show me that if its a thing stratum server can do


[01/28/2022 10:11 AM] cryptosafe#2323
Not sure if its automatic or not To do the whole share thing i know from my experience with Alephium that it does not but theres also not stratum sever on that local node mining setup with that coin. They made it easier to just get a full local node and solo mine


[01/28/2022 10:14 AM] Strider#6512
Not sure really how the share information can be relayed back through a local site. But the miner does report the hashrate.


[01/28/2022 11:30 AM] Strider#6512
also the node seems to timeout closer I get to 600k block


[01/29/2022 10:57 PM] cryptosafe#2323
I noticed  when running ergo local node my gpus hashrates are cut 70% so I guess solo mining on local node is a no go for me?


[01/29/2022 11:49 PM] Strider#6512
depends on the dfificulty you've set


[01/29/2022 11:50 PM] Strider#6512
hashrate is just basically your miner reportinng back. For instance, a single worker reported 2GHs but it doesn't mean anything other than putting more overhead o the network for the hash to be reported back.


[02/03/2022 3:40 PM] vahid#6592
Hi, i hope doing well
What is best value for diff and varDiff for solo mining?

[02/03/2022 3:43 PM] vahid#6592
Anything wrong?
I have 2GH hashrate and got nothing in 7days


[02/03/2022 3:59 PM] Strider#6512
Nothing wrong. 2GH isn't much to find a block but you are looking at 3 blocks per month.


[02/03/2022 4:15 PM] vahid#6592
Thanks for your reply, do you think my  diff and varDiff are correct value?


[02/03/2022 4:15 PM] Strider#6512
it depends how good your network is and how you want the hash to be reported back


[02/03/2022 4:15 PM] Strider#6512
I don't use it, I just have it set to 16gb as I understand if you are solo mining, then the difficulty doesn't matter


[02/03/2022 4:21 PM] vahid#6592
So i use 3256 port for solo mining without varDiff, right?


[02/03/2022 4:23 PM] Strider#6512
yes I guess, or you could set the difficulty higher and disable vardiff


[02/03/2022 4:23 PM] Strider#6512
just go with network difficulty


[02/03/2022 4:28 PM] vahid#6592
Thanks bro


[02/03/2022 8:05 PM] Andre05#9319
Hello. I have a mini farm 6.7 ghs of ethereum.  On every pool i mine i feel they cheat me because in statistics they show me reduced hashrate. For example, from my 6.7 statistics shows my current as 6.5 ghs. after conducting a research I came to conclusion that i have to create my own pool. However, ethereum blocks are too big for me to chew on. This is when ergo comes in handy. I have a question. If i have my own ergo pool, who will provide me blocks to calculate? Am i going to have all my computational power working on ergo blocks without any loss?

How big is ergo's blockchain? What hdd i need to buy to test my server?


[02/05/2022 2:47 AM] Elemental#9509
not large at all. Maybe about 10gb rn (Was at 8gb a few months ago when I last synced mine to test) You could just buy a 120gb SSD if you want (I'd recommend 500Gb for future or alternate use though if you decide to go another route)


[02/07/2022 5:11 AM] Elemental#9509

[02/08/2022 12:58 PM] Strider#6512
In fact, its easier to setup on linux than on windows because you don't need to worry about installing additional libraries

[02/08/2022 12:59 PM] MGpai#4313
oh cool so do you just get it from github and unzip and make sure you have node js?

follow the instructions on the git and you will be fine


[02/08/2022 1:00 PM] Strider#6512
make sure your node is fully synced as is your wallet


[02/08/2022 1:00 PM] Strider#6512
then clone the git repo, run npm update and update your start.js config


[02/08/2022 1:04 PM] MGpai#4313
do you need to also get that lib from open ssl ?


[02/08/2022 1:05 PM] Strider#6512

[02/08/2022 2:25 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
We use MiningCore because it is more geared for pool operators and contains API endpoints to facilitate creating an UI.    You can access the original repo here:

https://github.com/oliverw/miningcore

or the GetBlok.io version which we addressed a NUMBER of bugs and deficiencies for Ergo:

https://github.com/GetBlok-io/miningcore


Some (not all) of the deficiencies and enhancements have been merged to the oliver's main branch.

Everything we use is open sourced in our github account, for the exception of the UI. This is not because we don't want to share, but because we use licensed software that is not open sourced.


[02/08/2022 2:28 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Now if you are looking at our branches, master currently is non-smart contracts enabled, and develop is smart-contracts enabled. So if you are just trying to deploy  regular pool, I would suggest you use oliver's branch until we clean things up

Yes but there are lots of caveats.  It‚Äôs a great platform but you have to configure and run it. You still need a UI.


[02/08/2022 3:39 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273

H ali, keen to get involved in the building the network and running a pool is probably the best I can aim for with my skillsets. I have a few questions.

Is anyone hosting a pool on gcp/AWS could give me a rundown of their setup.

Does hosting a pool go against their no mining TOS. Would there be similar traffic patterns to regular mining that might trip their alerting system?

Anyone got a setup running in k8s? Any pros/cons to that idea? Eg better availability by running replicas or would it not be so simple to scale 

So far I understand you need to run a ergo node, pool server and a proxy. Proxy is trivially scalable I guess. Can the pool servers scale horizontally? Likewise for the node.

Which parts even need to scale when getting more miners?


[02/28/2022 11:10 PM] Ianor#2769
Hey, 
glad to see someone else using miningcore. How did you set up your ERGO nodes and configured the pool? 
I have a dedicated, hidden payoutnode and two fullnodes without privkey. Do I have to set the miningPubKeyHex option for the ergo nodes? What address did you set in the poolconfig? I have a very strange problem atm for not getting the 66ERG reward, just some dust for the last three blocks.

Kind regards

Ianor


[02/28/2022 11:25 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Hey fellow miningcore dude. So much to tell, so little time.  We have about 8 instances of mining core, each with its own node. Very important to ensure nodes are using same wallet in Each node. Funny things happen when a node uses a diff wallet for rewards.  All MC instances should be using same PSQL back end, same pool Id. Ensure only ONE mc stratum is configured for payout.  All others you just config the rewards address but use false for both payout configs.


[02/28/2022 11:26 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Also make sure you using latest code from MC main GitHub, some really bad bugs were fixed.  We‚Äôve forked a long time ago so almost diff code base by now.


[03/01/2022 8:14 AM] Ianor#2769
Thanks a lot for the headup. We use the actual v68 version of miningcore from Oliver himself.
To understand you correctly: 
You have just set mine=true in your ergo.conf file for your "mining" nodes. In the configuration, you've set your public ergo address, the one starting with a 9, not 88. And one stratum (a hidden in my case) has set payout to true.
Yes, every stratum is using the same PGSQL, we even have ZeroMQ Running for shareRealy
(In total 2 stratum for each coin we mine and, 1 payout and  1 api and 1 main MC instance are running for all coins together. payout, stratum and main have enableInternalStratum = false set, each node except payout has payout set to false, in main and pool config)


[03/02/2022 5:45 AM] Elemental#9509
Yoo. Any update on this setup tutorial from scratch, my guy?


[03/03/2022 3:19 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Yep i think you got it. I have not gone as far as splitting mining stratum from payout/api stratum, and mining node to payout node. Seemed diminished return when balancing the infrastructure and maintenance overhead vs performance impact. Of course payout is limited to a single stratum.  But we've layered a CDN globally in front of the API to help minimize the impact to the PSQL db.  Haven't used the ZeroMQ config either, seems to be lacking on documentation pertaining to ERGO so if you have some pointers that would be great. The code is super efficient and high performing that really does well without advanced configuration.  But we are a small pool so maybe we just haven't hit the limits yet.


[03/03/2022 3:20 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Oh thanks for the reminder.  Been so busy this fell to the back burner, but let me see if we can surface it back up.  I know that there were talks about an AMA


[03/03/2022 9:07 PM] Elemental#9509
Sounds good, my guy. Hopefully this gets released soon haha. The project seems really interesting as far as I've read but I feel like we really need a tutorial on how it all works and how to set it up


[03/14/2022 8:29 AM] Elemental#9509
dang setting up a pool using miningcore is a lot harder than it originally led me to believe


[03/14/2022 8:29 AM] Elemental#9509
just feels like a few things are missing


[03/14/2022 8:30 AM] Elemental#9509
anyone care to assist me with getting setup? I'm willing to pay if necessary üòÖ


[03/15/2022 2:56 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Your money is no good.  Glad to help a fellow erg dude.  Where are you stuck?


[03/15/2022 4:28 AM] Elemental#9509
Are you sure, my guy? Also, I'm having issues with pretty much getting started. I downloaded miningcore as well as PostgreSql (latest version), but I'm unsure how to run either of the programs because the miningcore github seems to be missing some context in it's setup tutorial. I opened the psql console and ran the commands as far as it allowed me but on the 4th command, it tells me it's wrong and closes the console/cmd promt


[03/15/2022 8:44 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
@AllCloudy | GetBlok.io You seem to be the Mining Core dude to talk to. Been skimming through the channel here a bit. I'm pretty new to all this, so how do you suggest running a simple Ergo pool? Like what all software is required and how should that be set up? My environment right now is hosting on a local machine for testing purposes until I get everything setup.

I want to make sure miners get paid appropriately and have access to a web interface. I've never done anything like this before, but I've been reading the ergo docs over at ergonaut.space. I'm confused on how you exactly use Ergo Stratum Proxy and Ergo Stratum server. Ergo NOMP isn't what I'm looking for either. Mining Core looks a lot more like what I want to get going, but I'm having trouble understanding if I would need to use Stratum Server with it or not. The documentation on all of this is a bit scattered feeling to me.

So first and foremost, running a mining pool requires IT infrastructure and computing/network/database fundamentals. If you have never deployed a database, a server, or a website you will be surely frustrated. Worst of all you may put your mining rewards all at risk of being either stolen or end up with a bunch of miners bugging you with ‚Äúwen payments‚Äù.  It‚Äôs not for the faint of heart.  So I think you should first be honest with yourself if it‚Äôs worth your journey.


[03/15/2022 10:07 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
You need to get a psql instance running, you may be having issues with the pg_hba config denying your connection. What command are you running?


[03/15/2022 10:16 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Mining core provides a strong high performing stratum to connect to your node and handle miner connections, and all the calculations and actual payout. It also publishes an api for use by any web Ui.  But you will need to handle the web front end, which is harder than said and done.  We also had to modify and expand the apis to offer what you see in GetBlok.


[03/15/2022 10:27 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
Okay I think that's what I needed to know


[03/15/2022 10:28 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
I've actually went to college before for database design. I'm familiar with designing and creating them.


[03/15/2022 10:29 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
I'm not expecting it to be easy just need to have an idea for what I need to do to get things done.


[03/15/2022 10:30 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
I'm also very familiar with *nix systems and how they operate on a low level. I have a Debian VM right now running the ergo node and I want to install pool software on it to get a basic testing environment.


[03/15/2022 10:32 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
It's possible that I may even have some ergo stuff included with a distribution I've been developing, but that's all a rant for another day.


[03/16/2022 12:14 AM] Elemental#9509
I just deleted the previous files so I'm starting at the beginning again so we could walk me through this step by step. Currently installing postgresql. I am curious though. Will all these options be necessary to download? or what would I need?

[03/16/2022 12:15 AM] Elemental#9509
(Keep in mind, this is currently being setup on my windows 10 pc locally, just to get a better understanding of how to set it up)


[03/16/2022 1:05 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
I would ensure you have it running and you can login with the postgres default user.  Once you can do that, you can load the SQL schema for miningcore.


[03/16/2022 1:05 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
You can just do the default install


[03/16/2022 2:02 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
I'll post this here for those looking at miningcore, which IMO is the best open source mining pool out there (and we looked at a LOT) if you are not a developer:

1) Use official GitHub Repo.  While GetBlok's is a fork, we have customized it quite a bit to work with the smartpool code side and its still a work in progress. So for now, I would stay with main repo if you want something turn key:  https://github.com/oliverw/miningcore 

2) You must deploy a working PostgreSQL database. I would use the newest version you can find here: https://www.postgresql.org/download/   Be careful of other distros and download links, this is the official link.

3) Install and configure PostgreSQL, many articles in the interwebs on how to do this.  If you are just kicking the tires, dont worry about scalability.  If you are deploying in production, you REALLY need to be careful on I/O and disk/cpu/memory as a public Miningcore API will pound on your database.    Keep all things default for now, here's a good simple article: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql/

4) Installing Miningcore will depend if you are on windows or Linux.  I personally prefer Ubuntu, so your mileage may vary here. Pay close attention to the dependencies needed as depicted in the https://github.com/oliverw/miningcore README.md.  Stay away from docker, you don't need it if you are just kicking the tires and want to mine to your own pool.  

5) Load the database schema.  Miningcore operates under the schema "miningcore" by default.   The steps are pretty simple:

- Login to postgres:  sudo -u postgres psql 
- Create schema:  

CREATE ROLE miningcore WITH LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'your-secure-password';
CREATE DATABASE miningcore OWNER miningcore;


[03/16/2022 2:05 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
-Load the schema. You MUST be able to connect to your database with the "psql" command before trying this.  As the postgres operating system user, run:

psql -d miningcore -f miningcore/src/Miningcore/Persistence/Postgres/Scripts/createdb.sql

-Apply partitions for the shares table. I would do this up front even if you dont think you will need it:

psql -d miningcore -f miningcore/src/Miningcore/Persistence/Postgres/Scripts/createdb_postgresql_11_appendix.sql

-Create your new pool. You do this ONCE for each new pool you create. 

CREATE TABLE shares_mypool1 PARTITION OF shares FOR VALUES IN ('mypool1');

"mypool1" becomes the unique identifier for your pool. Name it wisely üòÑ


[03/16/2022 2:19 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
6) Configure a pool config named <something>.json, place it in the build directory of miningcore.  Here's a sample file to use.  (extract the GZ and make sure its named <something>.json)

https://www.getblok.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ergo1.zip


[03/16/2022 2:29 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273 (pinned)
7) Start the pool.  You should configure it to auto start via a startup script. 

cd build
Miningcore -c <your config>.json

We use a different startup configuration that is pool specific so you may have to play around with it.  The JSON config specifies the log files you should look at for startup errors/issues/etc.  If you got this far, below is the startup log message you should get indicating you are running a healthy miningcore ergo pool:

Indicates your Node is online and synced: 

[2022-03-16 14:26:12.9080] [I] [ergo1] All daemons online
[2022-03-16 14:26:12.9345] [I] [ergo1] Daemon is synced with blockchain

Indicates Pool is online:

[2022-03-16 14:26:14.4346] [I] [ergo1] Pool Online

Indicates the diff setting, your fee, and that its a go:

Mining Pool:            <YOUR POOL NAME>
Coin Type:              ERG [ERG]
Network Connected:      <testnet|mainnet>
Detected Reward Type:   POW
Current Block Height:   <BLOCKHEIGHT>
Current Connect Peers:  5
Network Difficulty:     <NETWORK DIFF>
Network Hash Rate:      <NETWORK HASHRATE>
Stratum Port(s):        3056, 4056, 3156, 4156  <THIS SHOULD BE THE PORTS YOU HAVE CONFIGURED>
Pool Fee:               <YOUR FEE>

Pay close attention to the stats above in regards to the network. If your diff setting is wrong, the network difficulty wont be right.  

Hope this helps you guys and the community to grow decentralization!

Thanks for the tutorial, my guy. I really appreciate it. I'm a bit confused with step 5 though. I notice you said **- Login to postgres:  sudo -u postgres psql**
Is this supposed to be what you run immediately after opening the psql console? Or do I run this AFTER I am already logged in?


[03/16/2022 5:39 PM] Elemental#9509
I tried both ways and got errors so I'm confused on what the purpose of that cmd line is


[03/16/2022 6:08 PM] Elemental#9509
Also I seem to be having some issues with the final part of step 5. Any advice?

[03/16/2022 6:17 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
In windows when you open psql it already puts you in the psql terminal session


[03/16/2022 6:18 PM] Elemental#9509
so no need to run this command I'm guessing?


[03/16/2022 6:18 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Any database command should be in psql session


[03/16/2022 6:19 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
And seems like you already have the miningcore db created


[03/16/2022 6:19 PM] Elemental#9509
yeah i just ran those commands again to make sure they were


[03/16/2022 6:19 PM] Elemental#9509
^


[03/16/2022 6:19 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
for the partition command you need to do a step to drop existing share table and recreate it


[03/16/2022 6:20 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
I think it‚Äôs in the Oliver GitHub read me


[03/16/2022 6:27 PM] Elemental#9509
what about the syntax error I got?

correct me if I'm wrong but everything seems to be the way it should be


[03/16/2022 6:28 PM] Elemental#9509
I also ran that create table command again with a different name and got this message so I'm kinda stumped now:

The CREATE TABLE command needs to be in psql session

try psql -d miningcore


[03/16/2022 6:31 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
then run the CREATE TABLE syntax


[03/16/2022 6:32 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
i kind of dont like importing someone elses sql script because it makes it harder to troubleshoot. Can you post the createdb_postgresql_11_appendix.sql here so I can look?

ok let me review


[03/16/2022 6:39 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
so if you start a psql session and paste each of those lines individually, can you see where it fails?


[03/16/2022 6:39 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
start with SET ROLE then DROP TABLE


[03/16/2022 6:40 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
then paste the whole "CREATE TABLE" all the way to "PARTITION BY LIST" line.


[03/16/2022 6:40 PM] Elemental#9509
want me to delete then reinstall the miningcore build? just to get a fresh start for this rn lol


[03/16/2022 6:40 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
nah just the db...leave the miningcore build


[03/16/2022 6:41 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
all that is done is dropping a table in the DB so it can recreate it with partitioning


[03/16/2022 6:41 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
make sure you are in a psql session

what you pasted to me above


[03/16/2022 6:41 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
1) enter into psql session:

psql -d miningcore

2) Run the following commands:


[03/16/2022 6:42 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
SET ROLE miningcore;
DROP TABLE shares;


[03/16/2022 6:42 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273

[03/16/2022 6:43 PM] Elemental#9509
after I recreate the sql (using the following) you told me to delete, correct?
```psql -d miningcore -f miningcore/src/Miningcore/Persistence/Postgres/Scripts/createdb_postgresql_11_appendix.sql```


[03/16/2022 6:43 PM] Elemental#9509
or is this creating it?


[03/16/2022 6:44 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
that is simply modifying one table


[03/16/2022 6:44 PM] Elemental#9509
ah


[03/16/2022 6:44 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Again try what I suggested above first


[03/16/2022 6:45 PM] Elemental#9509
kk will run this cmd later then


[03/16/2022 6:45 PM] Elemental#9509
if still necessary


[03/16/2022 6:45 PM] Elemental#9509
but yeah running you cmds now


[03/16/2022 6:45 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
doing that appendix sql now is better than later. Because later you'll have data in that table from miners submitting shares


[03/16/2022 6:46 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
so the process is more complicated to ensure you dont loose any shares data


[03/16/2022 6:46 PM] Elemental#9509

happe 

[03/16/2022 6:56 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
open up the createdb.sql script into notepad. And copy and paste each command up to and including the semicolon (;)


[03/16/2022 6:57 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
You should get some response to each command indicating a success

copy each command and paste it in the psql session


[03/16/2022 7:02 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
a sql command ends with ;


[03/16/2022 7:02 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
so copy and paste up to and including the semicolon


[03/16/2022 7:03 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
The other thing I suggest as a tool for you to have is to install PGAdmin, it helps facilitate the management of the database


[03/16/2022 7:04 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
so you dont have to keep using the psql utility

I apologize if I'm basically repeating the same questions. I just like to clarify as much as possible when learning new things so I don't have to ask about something or run into issues later on üòÖ


[03/16/2022 7:10 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
you first need to create the database, so run the commands in the file I specified above


[03/16/2022 7:10 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
once that is done, then put the commands in the file appendix


[03/16/2022 7:10 PM] Elemental#9509
would you mind replying to the comment of which commands please? just making sure I am using the right one üòÖ

Hey @AllCloudy | GetBlok.io! so I just started from scratch again and I think I managed to figure almost everything out but I seem to be stuck on this last part and am unsure how to get past it:

[03/16/2022 11:45 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
I was afraid of this.  I can‚Äôt help ya on windows.  But check the version of .net core specified on the instructions.  I know I‚Äôve gotten tripped up on it before


[03/16/2022 11:46 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Also check the config, remove the cluster name


[03/17/2022 12:12 AM] Elemental#9509
removed but no fix:
```
//"clusterName": "us-west",
```


[03/17/2022 1:24 AM] Elemental#9509
Alright tried with the eth.json config from github and I got further now but now I'm stuck with it trying to come online ig? What would I need to do here to get it online?

[03/17/2022 2:17 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
no nodes


[03/17/2022 2:21 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
when MC comes online, it checks that it can talk to the node (daemons) and if they are ready for mining.  I can't talk about eth, as I dont use it for eth, but for ergo that means the ergo node isn't sync'ed or not ready or not configured right


[03/17/2022 2:26 AM] Elemental#9509
Does miningcore not create the node on it's own?


[03/17/2022 2:33 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
nah my man.  Node is blockchain specific.  MC is only a stratum.  The way mining works is this relationship:

miner -> stratum -> Node


[03/17/2022 2:33 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
so for ergo, you need to deploy a full node (reference client)


[03/17/2022 2:34 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
function of stratum is to broadcast to miners which block/problems to solve.  Miners submit those as shares to stratum, who in turn submit to the node.


[03/17/2022 5:39 AM] Elemental#9509
gotcha. So I still need to setup a full node like in here? https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Set-up-a-full-node Or do I need to setup a proxy as well? Or is that what the stratum is?
(Although this seems outdated) (And also I'm pretty sure we're gonna need a new video tutorial because of that big security issue or something that happened recently)

[03/17/2022 9:00 AM] Elemental#9509

            ],
```


[03/17/2022 1:23 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Can you access your node on localhost:9053? And use your api key info?


[03/17/2022 8:05 PM] Elemental#9509
I think that worked? It's just waiting for the node to finish syncing now. But also I got this error when StatsRecorder started (at the beginning with the rest of the stratum) . Any thoughts on how to get rid of the error? It says "relation poolstats does not exist". How do I correct this?

Yeah you should drop the database and recreate it.  You are missing some things from the db creation


[03/18/2022 2:50 AM] Elemental#9509
I literally just downloaded/compiled the entire miningcore files from scratch yesterday. How could I be missing something?


[03/18/2022 3:03 AM] Elemental#9509
also just wondering, how do I access the psql database to see all the tables and stuff?


[03/18/2022 3:05 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
not minincore files.  the database itself


[03/18/2022 3:05 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
you are missing something from the schema


[03/18/2022 3:05 AM] Elemental#9509
oh


[03/18/2022 3:06 AM] Elemental#9509
so just reinstall psql (postgresql)


[03/18/2022 7:40 AM] Elemental#9509
Trying to "Import the database schema". Anyone know what the command for this would be in windows?
```-d miningcore -f miningcore/src/Miningcore/Persistence/Postgres/Scripts/createdb.sql```I tried
```\d miningcore -f miningcore/src/Miningcore/Persistence/Postgres/Scripts/createdb.sql```but it said "relation 'miningcore' not found"


[03/18/2022 3:46 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
you dont really need to delete postgres, just drop the database miningcore


[03/18/2022 3:47 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
you can google for the command for it, plenty of examples


[03/18/2022 6:26 PM] Elemental#9509
Too late lol


[03/18/2022 6:27 PM] Elemental#9509
And yeah I spent about 2 hours last night looking around for how to import things but the tutorials are only from pgadmin, which doesnt work for me for some reason. Can't seem to find a psql version. Not giving up though lol. I'll try again when I hop back on my pc


[03/19/2022 9:08 AM] Elemental#9509
~~weird. I am currently resyncing the entire node from scratch and for some reasons it's going so much faster than before. And my pc isn't randomly freezing or lagging like crazy. Did we get a massive performance increase "recently"? within the last 10 updates? lol~~ was just the first half of the syncing that was fast. slowed down the closer I got to the current block


[03/21/2022 8:12 PM] Elemental#9509
Just wondering, is there a way for me to get more than 1 address from this node? ("more" just reveals the address string. No additional options)

Hey @AllCloudy | GetBlok.io So I managed to figure it all out but it seems that after the stratum said the node was synced, it threw this error and won't startup anymore without throwing this error. Any idea what I could do to fix this?

Just wondering, under the "pools" section in the ergo.json, am I supposed to put a number there as well or something for it to work properly?

            "coin": "ergo",
```


[03/21/2022 11:53 PM] Elemental#9509
I just noticed that on the github, it says the id is **mypool1**
```
CREATE TABLE shares_mypool1 PARTITION OF shares FOR VALUES IN ('mypool1');
```


[03/21/2022 11:54 PM] Elemental#9509
and in the eth pool example file, it has **eth1** for the id


[03/21/2022 11:54 PM] Elemental#9509
so is the name "ergo" interfering with the coin or something? thus preventing me from starting up


[03/22/2022 12:37 AM] Elemental#9509
Tested. Still getting the same error so I don't think it's the name


[03/22/2022 2:03 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
the id is just something unique


[03/22/2022 2:04 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
and should match what you enter in the create table above


[03/22/2022 2:04 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
'mypool1'  should match the id in the json config


[03/22/2022 2:09 AM] Elemental#9509
that's the confusing part. It does match


[03/22/2022 2:10 AM] Elemental#9509
I'm not sure if this would help but I could send you my ergo.json file if you think that might help


[03/22/2022 2:45 AM] Elemental#9509

Sorry buddy been tied up on other things. Glad you solved it, did seem like an authentication issue


[03/25/2022 9:51 PM] Elemental#9509
all good. It was a lot more simple than I actually expected it to be tbh haha


[03/25/2022 9:56 PM] Elemental#9509
Just gonna put this here for anyone that becomes interested in creating a pool with windows:

```Setting up MiningCore on windows 10:```

**Step 1) Install PostgreSQL 10 (or latest version)** https://www.postgresql.org/download/
(When installing, the "StackBuilder" tool is not required)

~~----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~~

**Step 2) In the windows search bar; search for "psql" and login using the info provided next to the questions in the pSQL Shell** (The password is the one used when installing PostgreSQL)

~~----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~~

**Step 3) Run the following commands:** (Replace "myPassword" with your own password)

CREATE ROLE miningcore WITH LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'myPassword';
CREATE DATABASE miningcore OWNER miningcore;

~~----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~~

**Step 4) Search your pc for the location the following files and run the following commands:** (Replace the paths under in commands, with the path to these files on your pc)

__Files to locate:__

createdb.sql
createdb_postgresql_11_appendix.sql


__Commands:__

\i c:/Users/Admin/Desktop/miningcore/src/Miningcore/Persistence/Postgres/Scripts/createdb.sql
\i c:/Users/Admin/Desktop/miningcore/src/Miningcore/Persistence/Postgres/Scripts/createdb_postgresql_11_appendix.sql

~~----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~~

**Step 5) Create the pool (for each coin you setup) using the following command:** (Only needs to be done ONCE per pool per coin) (Replace "coinName" with the name of your choice)

CREATE TABLE shares_coinName PARTITION OF shares FOR VALUES IN ('coinName');

~~----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~~

**Step 6) In your miningcore directory folder, in the "build" directory; create a coinName.json file and configure it** (Change the name to whatever coin you're setting up) (Make sure that under "logging", "logFile" and "apiLogFile" are not empty (The names could be "coinName_core.log" and "coinName_api.log") (Replace "coinName" with your coin name)

Example of what to put in your file: https://github.com/oliverw/miningcore/wiki/Configuration

~~----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~~

**Step 7) In your miningcore directory folder; create a bat file to run the following commands:** (Replace "coinName" with the name used in the previous step)

cd build
./Miningcore -c coinName.json

~~----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~~

**Step 8) Miningcore setup done. Enjoy!**   (Make sure your Node is synced completely for this to work)

You probably learned tons about what it takes to run a pool, looking forward to see you succeed buddy!


[03/26/2022 7:38 PM] Elemental#9509
I definitely did haha. It was honestly a really fun experience to learn how to do get it all setup


[03/26/2022 8:01 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
How are your payouts working? Getting any weird errors yet?  Make sure to test your pool on testnet so you don‚Äôt have to wait many days before finding a block then come to find issues


[03/26/2022 8:02 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
You will need a separate node configured with testnet but you can use same MC code, just setup a new pool id


[03/26/2022 8:51 PM] Elemental#9509
I have yet to test payouts yet but as far as I'm aware, the only errors I'm getting are on my node and it's this one:

It doesn't seem to affect the node but this error just occurs randomly


[03/26/2022 10:18 PM] Elemental#9509
Yo just wondering, what exactly is the factor under the payoutSchemeConfig supposed to indicate? And would it be recommended to change it from 2.0?
```
            // Generate payouts for recorded shares
            "paymentProcessing": {
                "enabled": true,
                "minimumPayment": 0.01,
                "payoutScheme": "PPLNS",
                "payoutSchemeConfig": {
                    "factor": 2.0
                }
            }
```

Anyone running the ergo daemon in docker?


[03/28/2022 1:20 AM] ProSavage#7131
I‚Äôm having an aneurism trying to get it to run and be stable.
It launches and runs fine without issues but it just likes to fucking freeze

I‚Äôve tried multiple machines and they have some pretty good specs too.


[03/28/2022 1:42 AM] ProSavage#7131
The containers will just freeze and won‚Äôt even respond to docker kill commands.


[03/28/2022 2:07 AM] ProSavage#7131

@here Pool Operators.
What version of node are you using? Are you using Linux or Windows?


[04/06/2022 5:22 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Linux latest version (I think .24)


[04/06/2022 10:36 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
Could I have a recommendation on what ergo.conf should look like for MiningCore?


[04/06/2022 10:47 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
Also where do I put the node API key for MiningCore?


[04/06/2022 10:48 PM] Elemental#9509
ergo.conf? or ergo.json?


[04/06/2022 10:49 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
nvm I figured this out


[04/06/2022 10:49 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
ergo.conf


[04/06/2022 10:50 PM] WheezyBackports#7260

Why would that be unrelated? I want to make sure I have the daemon setup for mining to work with Miningcore. I'm just double checking my settings since this is my first time.


[04/06/2022 10:52 PM] Elemental#9509
miningcore and the ergo node are 2 different things lol


[04/06/2022 10:52 PM] Elemental#9509
but miningcore utilizes the node to work together


[04/06/2022 10:52 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
Yeah, I already got the ergo.conf setup with the API hash and mining enabled.


[04/06/2022 10:53 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
Yeah, that's my point.


[04/06/2022 10:53 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
I wanted to know if there were any settings that are recommended for the node while using Miningcore for the pool software.

Also https://github.com/oliverw/miningcore/wiki/Configuration


[04/06/2022 10:57 PM] Elemental#9509
and alright awesome okay so luckily you only need to configure a few things within the ergo.json and you should be done


[04/06/2022 10:57 PM] Elemental#9509
let me check


[04/06/2022 10:58 PM] Elemental#9509
windows or linux?


[04/06/2022 10:58 PM] WheezyBackports#7260

> Stratum Port(s):        3056, 4056, 3156, 4156  <THIS SHOULD BE THE PORTS YOU HAVE CONFIGURED>

Are these ports for different difficulties? If so what difficulties should I have set?


[04/06/2022 11:01 PM] Elemental#9509
correct


[04/06/2022 11:01 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
ye


[04/06/2022 11:01 PM] Elemental#9509
also up to you. I think I was told that 0.4 was a good starting point


[04/06/2022 11:02 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
So just increment by 0.4?


[04/06/2022 11:02 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
For each port specifically


[04/06/2022 11:02 PM] Elemental#9509
increment by 0.1


[04/06/2022 11:02 PM] Elemental#9509
starting at 0.4 I'd say


[04/06/2022 11:02 PM] Elemental#9509
personally I like 0.5

[04/06/2022 11:04 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
So like start with 0.4 in place of 1024?


[04/06/2022 11:05 PM] Elemental#9509
for the difficulty


[04/06/2022 11:05 PM] Elemental#9509
yes


[04/06/2022 11:05 PM] Elemental#9509
the port can be whatever you want it to be


[04/06/2022 11:05 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
Okay


[04/06/2022 11:05 PM] Elemental#9509
if you plan on using var diff, make sure you set the min diff to be the same as the difficulty


[04/06/2022 11:06 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
so basically
```
3056: 0.4
4056: 0.8
3156: 1.2
4156: 1.6
```


[04/06/2022 11:06 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
Alright


[04/06/2022 11:06 PM] Elemental#9509
that's really high lol


[04/06/2022 11:06 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
Oh wait


[04/06/2022 11:06 PM] Elemental#9509
that's 4 different ports for users to connect to, each that you set with an even higher difficulty


[04/06/2022 11:07 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
duh meant to increment by 0.1 like you said


[04/06/2022 11:07 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
Anyway basically the jist right?


[04/06/2022 11:07 PM] Elemental#9509
0.5 for the base port is already good enough in my opinion


[04/06/2022 11:07 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
Alright


[04/06/2022 11:07 PM] Elemental#9509
then maybe 1.0 for a high difficulty port if you want one of those as well


[04/06/2022 11:07 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
I'm a little bit worn out lol been having to work my ass off recently to get some stuff going.


[04/06/2022 11:08 PM] WheezyBackports#7260

[04/06/2022 11:08 PM] Elemental#9509
here's an example of mine: 
```
                "5555": {
                    "difficulty": 0.5, //0.5 is good
                    "varDiff": {
                        "minDiff": 0.5, //0.5 is good
                        "maxDiff": null,
                        "targetTime": 15,
                        "retargetTime": 90,
                        "variancePercent": 30,
                        "maxDelta": 500
                    }
                }
```


[04/06/2022 11:09 PM] Elemental#9509

up to you. personally I'm leaving it uncapped


[04/06/2022 11:57 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
For all ports?


[04/06/2022 11:57 PM] Elemental#9509
for the base port


[04/06/2022 11:57 PM] Elemental#9509
i only plan to have 1 port for now


[04/06/2022 11:57 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
oh alright


[04/06/2022 11:58 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
Should I even have any specific difficulty ports or nah?


[04/07/2022 1:03 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
no no, the ports have nothing to do with difficulty. they are just for different purposes. One port can be var diff non ssl, the other vardiff ssl, another for high diff non ssl, and another for high diff ssl

I've used both my own config and edited the one found here. I still have issues connecting with both miners.

Oh yeah I should note I cloned the github repo and didn't compile a specific version. When I tried to build a specific version using the tar.gz source download I got an error about .git not being found when using the debian 11 script to build it. I didn't feel like messing around trying to manually compile it with the specific version.

Hello, I have a problem with my node. I just installed it in order to create a pool. The problem is that it has been two hours that the synchronization is not done. That of the Node and that of the Wallet. Does anyone have a solution to this problem please?
Or should I just wait longer?

Hello, my node and my mining server are working fine locally but I would like a friend to be able to connect to it so that he can mine.
Later on, why not put my node and my mining server on a cloud server but for the moment I just want to learn and do some tests. Do I have to open the ports of my box? Or should I use a VPN and transmit the ip to my friend?
Thanks to those who will take the time to answer üôÇ


[04/11/2022 7:59 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
You would only have to just open your pool ports. From there your friend can connect to your ip address using ip.ip.ip.ip:PORT


[04/11/2022 8:00 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
If you wanted to add some security you could use a VPN that allows you to do port forwarding


[04/11/2022 8:00 PM] WheezyBackports#7260

I'm not sure why you can't find your miner in the explorer. All I can say is you basically just need to open the ports that are used for connecting to the server and you're good to go.


[04/11/2022 8:04 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
If you're using a firewall like UFW on your machine (assuming you're using linux) you need to make sure to open them there too along with your router.


[04/11/2022 8:05 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
If you aren't using a firewall on your server I recommend installing UFW. This will give you some extra security.

[04/27/2022 6:54 PM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Hi folks I am new to this, I was curious about creating a pool. I have a node setup on the main net. The test net was giving me struggles. I had a few questions. When creating a pool in terms of payments do those get given out from the node wallet? If so can I use a lite node on a raspberry pie to give the rewards out? This would have the setting of mining false.  Also is there any port forwarding Involved and am I able to create a local pool that would allow multiple people in my network to join?(for example computers/miners on my network). Are there any other settings the node needs for mining? Disclaimer: I am new sorry if I asked any stupid questions.


[04/28/2022 12:23 AM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
No stupid questions.  You will need a stratum server. Check the pins I think that will be the most helpful.  A pi node is a challenge in its own.  I don‚Äôt believe it will have the resources to host a stratum server.


[04/28/2022 12:25 AM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Thanks for answering back ya. It seems that‚Äôs the case. I am slowly working on creating the pool by looking at the pinned comments but some of the wording can be miss read. But ya I can see what your saying.


[04/28/2022 12:26 AM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
I ended up moving the node to a spare computer I had lying around.


[04/28/2022 12:30 AM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
That‚Äôs a better option but keep in mind that will only support local connectivity.  To scale you will need regional servers which at that point cloud infrastructure would be needed. 

If you are just looking to mine yourself then you don‚Äôt need to worry about that.


[04/28/2022 12:30 AM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Yea pretty much. I just want to mine with my gpu from my desktop and have like one of my family members mine. If that‚Äôs even possible.


[04/28/2022 12:31 AM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Sorry for ping it would all be locally


[04/28/2022 12:32 AM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
No prob. If they are close by and you open the port for them then it should work depending on distance.  The other thing to keep in mind is if you only have one GPU it‚Äôs going to take a loooooong time to find a block if ever.


[04/28/2022 12:35 AM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Yea they are in the same residence as me on the same network. But ya that‚Äôs true. Though I was thinking more along the lines of like mining and getting paid for shares regardless of  finding block. Also when you say opening port you mean on the router?  I just wanna make sure I am following the process correctly


[04/28/2022 12:40 AM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
If your on the same network it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem.  But taking a step back.  You will need to find blocks to get paid if you set up your own pool.  You will only get paid for shares by joining an established pool.  For example our pool is PPLNS (pay per last N share) which without getting too technical the pools payments are being disbursed based on the miners contribution of shares submitted.  In our case it goes back to the last 50000 shares N=50000.  So using round numbers if you contributed 10000 of those shares you would receive 25% of the block payout


[04/28/2022 12:42 AM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Oh interesting so I would need to essentially have the node find blocks and then have the gpu mine them. So what would you say is a good payout system for a starting pool?


[04/28/2022 12:52 AM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
The node is basically validating the blocks. GPU-> Mining Software -> Stratum -> Node


[04/28/2022 12:52 AM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Ah!


[04/28/2022 12:52 AM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
And edited the above.  We are 50000 shares.  That‚Äôs fairly standard for pplns.


[04/28/2022 12:55 AM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
So for a pool that‚Äôs brand new with like only 1-3 miners would PPLNS be fair or PPS? Also a question about the creation using mining core I am on the portion where I loaded the schema and all that. Do I create the coin config/ pool config first then run the Create table ‚Äúmypool1‚Äù? Or run that sql then the config


[04/28/2022 12:56 AM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
You could go either way honestly


[04/28/2022 12:58 AM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Ya cause those steps are confusing. Hha. But even for payments eh I could do either PPLNS or PPS interesting. I think I might do PPS for a short time. Is it bad to switch payment methods on the fly?


[04/28/2022 1:07 AM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
I don‚Äôt think it would make much of a difference as it‚Äôs only calculated when a block is found.


[04/28/2022 1:09 AM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Ah I see thank you.

Hi again does anyone know how the payment to miners works in mining core?


[04/28/2022 4:00 PM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Hi everyone I am back again sorry for the spam of questions. I was just curious as my node is close to syncing and I was curious about connecting my miners locally. So the node and pool is on a laptop and my miner is on a desktop(both are on the same network/wifi). In order to get the miners to connect do I set the listening address to a certain port in the pool to be set to the laptops ipv4 address or the default gateway? Would I have to portforward?


[04/30/2022 1:55 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
I can't speak to all software, but typically pools pay miners 99% and keep 1% of total block reward.   That 99% is typically further split proportionate to customer miners hashrate.


[04/30/2022 2:00 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
If you're doing everything over LAN, port forwarding isn't necessary.  You may have to open a port between your miner and your stratum server however, depending what port you put stratum on. 

If you keep the node and pool on the same server, the two can communicate via the internal loop (localhost, i.e. 127.0.0.1), but if you separate the programs to different machines, make sure traffic is allowed on 9053 (mainnet) and/or 9052 (testnet).


[04/30/2022 2:02 PM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Ooooh


[04/30/2022 2:03 PM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
I see what your saying so I would need to open the port from the desktop to the laptop node to run the miner? If I think what your saying is correct.


[04/30/2022 2:04 PM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Casue ya both my node and pool are on the laptop. But ya logically I was thinking you could run the miner to the pool with out any port forwarding Casue both are in the same network


[04/30/2022 2:05 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
Correct.  On your firewall.  Especially if you're running Windows.


[04/30/2022 2:06 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
Port forwarding only applies to WAN.  You'll get there eventually üôÇ

It's also possible to have all three (node, pool, miner) on the same machine!  Networking becomes very easy then.

[04/30/2022 2:10 PM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820

All questions are always welcome! üôÇ


[04/30/2022 2:12 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
Correct.  Typically, you just need to open the port on the Stratum servers.  Most machines allow all outbound connections, but block incoming.


[04/30/2022 2:13 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
Since the miner is initiating the traffic, stratum pool just needs to be ready to accept it. It would rare, but I suppose it is possible that your miner's OS is preventing outbound traffic as well.


[04/30/2022 2:14 PM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Oh I see ok. Ya so opening the port to the pool instead.


[04/30/2022 2:15 PM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Casue logically the miner is connecting to the pool and pool is talking to the node which are on the same machine.

9) If you host your miner, pool, or node on separate machines, you'll need to open ports to allow that traffic.

Illustration of initial mining traffic:
Miner -> (connects on your defined Stratum port I.e. 3746) -> pool server -> connects to node RPC (9053, mainnet or 9052, testnet) -> node
Once connections are established, traffic becomes bi-directional.

Note: you will not need to open ports if any of the above layers are on the same machine.  Internal traffic runs via the internal loop (localhost). 

Typically, machines block incoming traffic (but allow outgoing) by default. If you're just testing on LAN, you'll simply need to open these ports on your OS's firewall.  But when you get to WAN, you'll additionally need to set up port forwarding on your network router.

Only way to do it is to go into the code and add it in with a new db call. At least on older versions. Not sure if its included in newer ones


[05/14/2022 3:48 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
There is one.  Search Google for miningcore ui and you‚Äôll find some examples.

Hello everyone üëã, quick question.... If it exists, where can I find a simple docker compose or something for quickly setting up or hosting a pool (full node, miningcore,postgres etc...)?

Hey guys. I got the node running, wallet, #swagger working and node syncing. Got mining = true and running  ErgoProxyServer but can't get hiveOS to connect to my node. When i run node start.js on startum server i get error: Invalid 'main' field of multihashing; cannot read properties of null ( reading 'proof of work') any ideas? Or does an easier option exist - no manual labour üòã


[05/26/2022 10:17 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
you need to deploy a stratum to handle the miner connections. You dont mine directly to your node.


[05/26/2022 10:18 PM] CryptoHP#8991
I have done this but could not get hive to connect to the startum. Does anyone have a proper tutorial


[05/27/2022 6:51 AM] Numark#2678
You need to make sure that the stratum server is connected to the node, if they are on different server check that the corresponding ports are open. The stratum server is like a proxy to the node, your mining software from hive connects to the stratum server and the stratum server connects to the ergo node


[05/28/2022 4:22 PM] Babelfish24#2887
Hi, I need some help: I have stared a node and have the stratum server running, However when I mine to it I am not getting and shares on the miner. I can see that the miner is building the new dataset for each block, but it never finds a share.  If I mine to a pool, the miner has no issues with finding and submitting shares.  Here is a screen shot of the Node powershell.

during the creation of my node I have an error when I replace mining = false by mining = true 
my error message is "Mining is enabled, but chain.reemission.checkReemissionRules = false , set it to true"
is there a command line to add?

Problem solved by adding
ergo {

how?


[06/22/2022 5:27 AM] Babelfish24#2887
There needs to be a modification to the instructions
Step 3) Run the following commands: (Replace "myPassword" with your own password)

CREATE ROLE miningcore WITH LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'myPassword';
CREATE DATABASE miningcore OWNER miningcore;

\q     (to quit pSQL)

Step 4) Search your pc for the location the following files and run the following commands: (Replace the paths under in commands, with the path to these files on your pc)

Files to locate:

createdb.sql
createdb_postgresql_11_appendix.sql

Start pSQL again and login with  miningcore for database and user (using the miningcore password)

Commands:

\i c:/Users/Admin/Desktop/miningcore/src/Miningcore/Persistence/Postgres/Scripts/createdb.sql
\i c:/Users/Admin/Desktop/miningcore/src/Miningcore/Persistence/Postgres/Scripts/createdb_postgresql_11_appendix.sql

then procede to step 5

For some reason, we have an instance of your v69 that we fixed for our pool but don‚Äôt remember what we fixed to push the fix back to you.

[07/02/2022 4:36 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
So I assume you have a running testnet node that is sync‚Äôed?  

And you built a MC instance and configured it to point to that node in your MC json file?

Does MC start up and logs that all daemons are online?

[07/02/2022 4:38 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
It takes time, people have to be familiar with your pool and trust you.  Up time and payouts are the deciding factor


[07/02/2022 4:38 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
If I were you, test your pool on testnet so that you get blocks payment processing working


[07/02/2022 4:38 PM] Kyiv pool#2973
We dont have our first bloxk yet to make payments


[07/02/2022 4:38 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
It could take you weeks if not months to then find out payment processing isn‚Äôt working


[07/02/2022 4:39 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
second, test every single miner on your pool. For example, MC V69 has a big where TRM doesn‚Äôt work


[07/02/2022 4:39 PM] Kyiv pool#2973
But in general it works as it should?

[07/07/2022 6:24 AM] Babelfish24#2887
I'm looking for suggestions for my config.json file. I have an ERGO node setup and just want to mine to my node. I just want the rewards to go to the node wallet. What should I put in the config.json file for that... Also if I am mining to my own node, should I use varidiff? Or should I just set a static difficulty? Would it be more likely to hit a block with a low static diff like 1.0 if I'm not worrying about network congestion?

Any help would be appreciated üôÇ

Few questions: From top to bottom of the config.json file
1. What are the options for logging level?
2. This is a Windows install, should I delete the banning section?
3. I don't intend on using the notifications, should I delete the section or just set all the trues to false?
4. If the miningcore setup is just for personal use, should I set the paymentprocessing enabled to false?  I just want the reward to go to the node wallet.
5. under reward recipients fee percentage, what should I put here for a personal server? 100% or 0%?
6. For ports, should I maximize the number of shares with a static diff as long as I'm not getting too many rejected low diff shares?  Would that give me a higher chance of hitting the block?  How should I set up the port for that?
7. Under the daemons, are the username and password used?  I'm not sure where these are for the ergo node?
8. Under the payment processing enabled, should I change this to false for personal node mining?


[07/08/2022 3:14 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
You still need all the sections, and you still need payment processing. But I hear payment processing is broken in miningcore. We dont use MC for payment processing so can't help you here.  Fee you can leave it 0% since its not for a pool mining.  The rest you should research and test.


[07/09/2022 9:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
Payment processing is not broken. I was broken for Ergo EIP27 before the v70 release. And just for Ergo.


[07/09/2022 2:39 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Good to know. Also figured out the cluster deployment setup.  And lastly the TRM issue is fixable.  We fixed it on our running instances but unfortunately don‚Äôt have a copy of source code we compiled from and can‚Äôt remember what we did to fix it.  Saw you closed the issue on your repo?

okay, I found the issue -- you must launch psql specifically at the miningcore database üôÇ


[08/11/2022 9:52 PM] CharlZ#1426
Ok so I have been hitting my head on a problem here. Been researching everywhere and trying different things, but nothing does it.


[08/11/2022 9:52 PM] CharlZ#1426
1. Miningcore is running, it's binded to a domain , I can mine to it from external, good.


[08/11/2022 9:52 PM] CharlZ#1426
2. I have configured a miningcore WebUI with the domain, so I can see it form the internet, and the api works, good. ( HERE, i'm using http only)


[08/11/2022 9:52 PM] CharlZ#1426
3. When I configure SSL, so my pool website is assed with https (which works), the API stops working : Either the WebUI tries to clal the api using HTTP ( http://mydomain.com:4000/api/ ), but the secured pages in https refuses to load a non-secured http componant, or else I try to load the api using HTTPS ( https://mydomain.com:4000/api/ ), but I get : GET https://mydomain.com:4000/api/pools net::ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR


[08/11/2022 9:53 PM] CharlZ#1426
**Does anyone know how we can actually pass the API through SSL ?** @Deleted User @AllCloudy | GetBlok.io  maybe ?


[08/11/2022 9:53 PM] CharlZ#1426
I even tried to bind a certificate in the miningcore json config file ( which was converted from the same 3 files, inclusing the key, that I use for the SLL config on my web server, with openssl pkcs12 -export [...] ), but changed nothing


[08/11/2022 9:53 PM] CharlZ#1426
( EX : "api": {
"enabled": true,
// Binding address (Default: 127.0.0.1)
"listenAddress": "0.0.0.0",
// Binding port (Default: 4000)

)


[08/11/2022 10:05 PM] Balvand#0653
@CharlZ I think I am right behind you in terms of progress, so if I get there and solve it I will let you know. I am only trying to get everything working on LAN, however, but in theory our SSL battle should be similar.

miner 1 hasn't hashed in more than a day, and miner 0 does not have that hashrate anymore. So I am confused how one would build a semi-accurate/up-to-date pool UI when the underling API has issues

Been playing a lot with that lately and ended up with a fully working mining pool ( Based on another miningcore ui : https://github.com/minernl/Miningcore.WebUI )
BUT it seems that there are issues with the miningcore api itselfs updating / not updating top miners and workers , especially inactives one still being shown. But aside from that the api works pretty well

@AllCloudy | GetBlok.io I have it running yes.


[08/18/2022 3:22 PM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
So i copied along and lurked... from what SOAT and some others here did and I have everything up and running.  
postgres  in aws, 
local node running on a VM in proxmox
the webui running on another machine in a docker container.
The miningcore software i had to build and run native, I couldn't get it to build properly in the docker container.

I copied and modified the ergo config file that the guys from getblock shared ( thanks for that, it was really really needed)

Just wanted to say thank you to all.


[08/18/2022 3:54 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Glad you got it going.  Yes we run in docker but build outside of it.  easier to manage.

[08/18/2022 5:38 PM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
So I have been playing around with the config file and added the variable high diff pool ( basically copied the config from GetBlok.io)
```
  "3057": {
           "name": "HIGHDIFF POOL GPU",
           "listenAddress": "0.0.0.0",
           "difficulty": 0.931315,
           "varDiff": {
             "minDiff": 8,
             "maxDiff": null,
             "targetTime": 15,
             "retargetTime": 10,
             "maxDelta": 500,
             "variancePercent": 30
           }
         }
       },
```

I am seeing quite a few reject shares now, from difficulty being too low and my ratio is 28.9% reject.

I understand varDiff ( or maybe I don't), but i am confused by the reject shares and why i'm getting them.


[08/18/2022 5:51 PM] Balvand#0653
Difficulty too high for your hashrate I think


[08/18/2022 5:52 PM] Balvand#0653
Or I noticed my rigs get the same behavior on high diff default settings, anyways


[08/18/2022 5:59 PM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
Are there any documents or FAQ's anywhere that talk about setting the varDiff?


[08/18/2022 8:45 PM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019

sorry for the spam I am just excited with my first block unlocking. 
the only remaining confusion: why did my pool wallet keep 4 of the 48 ergo available from the block when poolFeePercent is set to 1?


[08/20/2022 12:05 AM] CharlZ#1426
Because it's PPLNS , most probably ! If some (you) shift the hashrate before the block has its 720 confirmations, the pool keeps the rest ( And usually, fee wallet should ideally be another wallet than the pools's main wallet )

What does 'pendingshares" in the miningcore api ( which is also displayed in the ui I am using ) indicate?       Is it the number of blocks that I've submitted before the pool has found a block?


[08/22/2022 6:46 AM] arkadias#4896
how do i expose the stratum to the web so i can point rented hash at my local instance of miningcore? currently i can point my rigs on the local network at it fine. i have a domain name and cloudflare and run nginx on my server but i'm pretty daft in what i do to connect the dots haha

yeah i'm looking at the miningcore api and it doesn't pass along the id.  It maybe a config file that has to be more fleshed out, not sure yet.

I just created another wallet address and added another pool entry into the config with a different wallet address and different ports.

Also @jvx why do you need more peers? The peers are for your node staying in sync with the network. Functionally, this will be the same for your pool at 30 peers or 300


[08/29/2022 5:32 PM] Balvand#0653
That is my understanding anyways


[08/29/2022 5:39 PM] Cryptonite#4578
You're right, but I wanted to test it at first like this, it looked easier to set up but yes after understanding how it's working I will switch it. this line look like this. üôÇ

Hi. I agree. But, I would like to know. Do you know where I can setup the number of peers?


[08/29/2022 6:12 PM] Balvand#0653
I believe it would be in the ergo node config @jvx


[08/29/2022 6:15 PM] Cryptonite#4578
Do you have an idea about this probleme ?


[08/29/2022 10:00 PM] Balvand#0653
no, i would look at the (non-commented) lines above that line and look for an error potentially though


[08/29/2022 10:01 PM] Balvand#0653
it's trying to use daeons as a key in a dictionary but is trying to convert string to int i think (?) but idk why


[08/29/2022 10:01 PM] Balvand#0653

[08/30/2022 12:42 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
You have something wrong defined in the mc config.


[08/30/2022 12:42 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
For daemon section


[08/30/2022 12:42 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Sometimes specifying value as integer versus string can cause issues


[08/30/2022 12:42 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Best idea is to look at one of the posted sample configs


[08/30/2022 12:46 AM] jvx#0292
Any documentation showing how to setup the number of max peers in ergo conf file?

It takes time. Also helps if your node is in a good internet connection and has enough memory and JVM size is larger than default. I suggest a 6GB JVM size for nodes.  Oh, and which region you are from. Our node in far out Australia only gets a handful, while our nodes in USA gets lots of attention.

@Balvand I'm facing a lot of rejects using Trex in a 6x3070 rig. Miningcore log showing the message rejected low share diff. What difficulty are you using to test your pool? I'm using one and vardiff uncaped.


[08/31/2022 3:09 PM] Balvand#0653
I think effort is misleading because they calculate using net hash and difficulty and that stat currently updates very slowly with miningcore

[09/01/2022 1:18 PM] jvx#0292
Morning! I've been facing a lot of miner timeouts. My node is fully synced, and I have oliverw Miningcore version installed, configured, and running, using @AllCloudy | GetBlok.io json config example I setup 2 ports, low and high difficulty. On low difficult port, I'm using the lastest nbminer on Windows and the High port I'm using Hiveos. Both workers are working fine, connecting and sending shares accordyling. From time to time, both get disconnected simultaneously, keep a few minutes trying to connect again, showing the socket operation timeout error, and 2 minutes later, they connect again. I asked some friends to test it when it happens, all workers get disconnected. No matter if it was connected through local or external network. I checked miningcore core.log, and the only input I can see there when the clients get disconnected is multiple lines of "Connection Closed". Have anyone experienced something like this? I don't know if it is a miningcore bug, or a miner (nbminer) behavior. Besides this momentaneous timeout problem, everything is working pretty well.


[09/01/2022 3:25 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Well, all I can tell you is that running a mining pool requires high performing network and compute. If you are getting intermittent drops, that means something is not performing well or able to handle the connections.  This is I often tell@people, leave pool operations to pool operators.  Running your own local pool sounds cool, until you run into these nuances.  At best, keep it simple and run it all on a single machine with sufficient memory and cpu.


[09/01/2022 3:41 PM] jvx#0292
Thanks. But I'm not running a local pool. It is a Ubuntu VPS machine with 16 vcpus and 32mb ram, inside a huge datacenter infrastruture. Are you using your own version of Miningcore @AllCloudy | GetBlok.io ?

Hi. I want to implement my own pool for mining ERG.
There are a few questions I don't understand.

1) Response of /mining/candidate got pk. Is it public key of my coinbase address?

Body of /mining/solution should have values with following keys: pk, w, n, d. 
2) Should I use same pk from /mining/candidate in this body?
3) What is the value w and d means? What should I set here?

I should set a parameter version in a mining work. 
4) Should I always request /info and use value of parameters.blockVersion here? Or this value can be hardcoded and I can not request /info before (or after) request a new blocktemplate via  /mining/candidate?

Thank you!

Hi people!

I've successful set my Ergo node that is running and it is up to date.  I have miningcore running fine as well and I'm using nbminer for mining and getting accepted shares in a good amount. Now I'd like to implement a front end web page to monitor de process. is there anyone can help me on this?


[09/04/2022 3:33 PM] jbsacminer#6897
And a question I still have  is how can I check if my shares are really reaching de mainnet? I'm worried the accepted shares I'm seeing in the miner could be only a response from miningcore and no real interactions with mainnet.

We have to find good numbers for the diff values. But how i know if they are right?


[09/06/2022 7:55 PM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
if your miners have issues submitting shares, it's probably wrong.  honestly it's why i copied the values from the getblok guys.  They run more in production than I do.


[09/06/2022 8:04 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
It‚Äôs a perpetual thing, our low diff has been a good baseline for months. But it‚Äôs not uncommon to have a low/medium/high diff setting


[09/06/2022 8:05 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
it‚Äôs about finding a balance on how many shares miners are submitting. If it‚Äôs too easy then they submit too many shares which can cause banning from pools. Too little (long time between submitting shares) means you may be working on a candidate block that has already been found


[09/06/2022 8:16 PM] jvx#0292

[09/06/2022 8:23 PM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
the 0.9313 is what we all used.  We had 40Gh and we were hitting blocks up until Saturday morning, after that difficulty was too high.


[09/06/2022 8:25 PM] jvx#0292
we are still in a testing phase just 10ghs. Yesterday I noticed the node stuck in one block forever, so weird, I need to reboot everything


[09/06/2022 8:28 PM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019

just ensure you have EIP27 enabled in your ergo node. miningcore will not warn you and it will throw scary errors and fail on payments without it enabled in ergo node config.

@Balvand node {

  } this option needs to be setup to true or false? I've seen examples with this true and others false.

mining = true
external miner is true because you aren't using the cpu of the node to do the mining.... that's for test net stuff

Yo so what are the average VPS specs that you guys would recommend for a multi-coin pool? I currently plan to start with ergo for now but plan to expand to more later on and want to know if I should get high quality specs now or just get the minimum and upgrade later?

Alternatively, what would be the minimum required specs for an ERGO pool?


[09/08/2022 5:56 AM] KOBERIT#3829
I started the same project last week and got a bigger vps with 8vcores 16gm ram and nvme ssd. During the syncprocess it was struggling with 600% cpu usage. After completion the ergo node and miningcore only use 10%. So take middleway.

Make sure the password is the same password you used when installing postgres

Lessons learned running Miningcore on GetBlok.io:
1) Your PSQL database will be your first bottleneck. This is due to heavy dependency on the shares table, and even with partition, looking back at 50,000 shares and calculating stats starts to cause a bottleneck.  At scale, you will need premium SSD drives for low latency and high I/O in the DB layer. Plan on offloading old shares from shares table to an archive table, to reduce overall row size.
2) Globally distributing Mining Core can be a compounding effect. It is not designed to have multiple instances of MC pointing to same DB back end. For that, you need to scale using the Share Relay mechanism built in to MC.
3) UI and API access will become a bottle neck and ultimately impact your DB back end.  For this, you need to leverage a CDN caching mechanism other wise your API will get hammered by UI calls, and while MC API is high performance and does fine, the db back end will not.
4) Size of Mining core instance can be as small as 2 cpu and 4 gb memory if you distribute the Share handling (stratum), API, and share calculations (master relay).  MC performs super well in high load.  

Most of the above starts applying to you once you get 200-400 GH/s hashrate but also dependent on users accessing your UI.

Hi All. Any tip for using mining rentals or nicehash with miningcore.? I've noticed that users that use those are getting a lot of disconnections and zombie worker messages.


[09/08/2022 4:45 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Make sure you use a pool that has a high diff port


[09/08/2022 6:25 PM] jvx#0292
How high? I have a Port with 8, but I also test with d=40, and I have the same result


[09/08/2022 6:48 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
well, our high diff port at GetBlok.io has unlimited max high (null).  I think we start with 8 min diff, and retarget 10, target 15, variance 30, maxdelta 500.  But we are still tuning.


[09/08/2022 6:51 PM] jvx#0292
thanks man. I will try with maxhigh null. I let this not null, because in our former ETH pool, a hacker managed to use this to double the number of shares he sent.


[09/08/2022 6:58 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
how? increasing diff = harder to send shares


[09/08/2022 6:59 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
but with MC, the banning mechanism for bad shares is also useful


[09/08/2022 7:15 PM] jvx#0292
I really don't know. But he told us that this was the way he did.  He sent a message offering his services and proofing the payment.

Hi all. Is any particular configuration needed to run Miningcore with Nicehash or Mining Rentals? I rented a rig to test it, and I get disconnected as soon my worker is authorized.


[09/10/2022 12:41 PM] KOBERIT#3829
What does the value pending shares mean?


[09/10/2022 2:50 PM] jvx#0292
It is the number of valid shares that you send in the current round.


[09/10/2022 2:52 PM] jvx#0292
Some findings so far.

Hash Rental:
Nicehash and MiningRentals are not working; they connect but disconnect immediately. No matter the difficulty. I tried 3 different rentals with same result, and I also tried other Ergo Miningcore pools and got the same result.  Using the debug mode, the message is just a "Received EOF" and "Connection Closed". 

MINERS:
More stable one, any ports, low or high. NBMINER 42.2
Trex 0.26 works well with high fixed diff like 20, but my friend and I experienced weird disconnections.
Lolminer didn't work for me


[09/10/2022 4:11 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Hmm did you test GetBlok?  We have done nicehash rentals and works fine during our tests

[09/11/2022 7:38 PM] Balvand#0653
i.e.        "maxActiveJobs": 20        means the 21st worker/rig will have issues? or am I misunderstanding and this limits something else

Has anyone experienced the node losing sync? It happened twice to me.  The console is showing "node is synced," but when I look at the current height and compare it with the last block found, the node is some blocks behind, and the miners are sending shares for the same block.

[09/13/2022 2:30 AM] Balvand#0653
i think there must be a setting in miningcore to tell it you are using testnet and not mainnet


[09/13/2022 2:31 AM] Balvand#0653
my node says it is synced, anyways


[09/13/2022 2:31 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273

you don't need user, that's why it is commented. Password is your wallet password

Hey guys, i just started a node to support network. I think now about setting mining pool. Is it MUCH harder than node? Do i need public ip?


[09/16/2022 9:17 AM] Patryk Smoli≈Ñski#9893
If i understand correctly, i need to wait for my node to sync and then setup ErgoStratumServer now, and then copy the ergo-nomp to my NODE folder, and configure and run ergo-nomp? Why i need ErgoStratumProxy then?

I got miningcore on an ergo testnet (the official testnet is busted) to test custom payout threshholds, but miningcore doesn't like it when you try to get hundreds of blocks to batch in a single tx (MaxInputsExceededError) üòÇ


[09/16/2022 6:04 PM] Balvand#0653
I think it's wild that there is no testnet right as merge happened lol
I just want to mine like 1-2 blocks and then wait for them to confirm, but if you're the only miner, you need to mine 720 blocks... leading to a feedback loop of way too much ERG in your wallet for miningcore's batch tx logic lol


[09/16/2022 6:06 PM] Balvand#0653
not sure what your hashrate is, but you may be waiting a while. Consider spinning up another miningcore on the testnet! üòâ

Where it is confirmed? Miningcore?


[09/16/2022 6:52 PM] KOBERIT#3829
yes and if i view my node and its wallet the balance is ok, but in the block explorer there is nothing


[09/16/2022 6:53 PM] jvx#0292
So, you can see the balance in Node Wallet? But not in the wallet address in block explorer? That's it?


[09/16/2022 6:55 PM] KOBERIT#3829
yes if i visit the node panel and unlock the wallet i can see 60.XXXX ERG. but if i watch it at explorer.ergoplatform.com theres nothing


[09/16/2022 6:55 PM] KOBERIT#3829

Or maybe i'm stupid


[09/16/2022 7:09 PM] KOBERIT#3829
when i open the node and unlock the wallet. so i can take this address and look it up at the explorer of ergo and theres 0 balance

it is normal. look at this block I mined. My pool wallet is:     9edq1bwf88Zx ‚Ä¶ hMer2ChHpqf2 but you will see it nowhere on this confirmation page: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/blocks/c036087bef7f12da0136d411716411de907108122c4e6ba1821d300e4a3365b4/transactions

those are the Ubuntu distro versions


[09/17/2022 6:47 AM] blackinsecure#3693
Ubuntu has a new release every 6 months, April (hence the .04) and October (.10)


[09/17/2022 6:47 AM] blackinsecure#3693
you gotta run the one equivalent to the Ubuntu you have installed


[09/17/2022 6:48 AM] Elemental#9509
I see. So which would you recommend I install? and why, if I may ask?


[09/17/2022 6:48 AM] blackinsecure#3693
22.04, the latest LTS (long-term support) one


[09/17/2022 6:49 AM] blackinsecure#3693
the ones launched on April of even years are LTS


[09/17/2022 6:49 AM] blackinsecure#3693
so 22.04 and 20.04 are the last two LTS ones


[09/17/2022 6:50 AM] blackinsecure#3693
18.04 lost LTS because it's too old now


[09/17/2022 6:50 AM] Elemental#9509
I see. So why would people be telling me to download 18 then?

[09/17/2022 6:54 AM] blackinsecure#3693
stick to either 22 or 20, because 18 isn't LTS anymore


[09/17/2022 6:55 AM] blackinsecure#3693
newer things might start breaking because of no support


[09/17/2022 7:06 AM] Elemental#9509
I see. So if that's the case, how would I go about setting up a pool for neoxa? It says the requirements are 18 for some reason

1) So stick with 22 or just do 18 as stated? I plan to create a pool for both ergo and neoxa
2) I'm aware which is why I was hesitant to ask üòÖ


[09/17/2022 7:14 AM] blackinsecure#3693
I'd stick with 22 and only go to 18 if it's 100% absolutely necessary


[09/17/2022 8:26 AM] Elemental#9509
Noted. Also, quick question. Is it common for newer pools to host their entire pool (node and database) on a single VPS? Or what is the common setup people do to get these pools up and running?


[09/17/2022 8:32 AM] blackinsecure#3693

[09/17/2022 8:42 AM] KOBERIT#3829
I host my node pool and db on a vps with 8 cores and 16gb ram with 70gh. All fine only 20% hardware use. If you have a view 100gh you should scale from my point of view


[09/17/2022 8:43 AM] Elemental#9509
What's being used more? Cores or ram?


[09/17/2022 8:44 AM] Elemental#9509
That's my current setup rn but wanna make sure I didn't just waste money on an overkill setup, when I should have bought multiple or something üòÖ


[09/17/2022 8:46 AM] KOBERIT#3829
On normal running ram. Only on payouts it gets high for a view seconds. I would start with a medium size vps. My vps is oversized for that small pool. I think miningcore recommends 3 servers splitted but you can find it on the website. Start small and scale and dont wast money because its hard to find miners for the own pool


[09/17/2022 8:55 AM] Elemental#9509
Would you mind linking me to where this is recommended please?

If you want to lure hack3rs to p0wn your db, this is what you would do üòÜ


[09/17/2022 1:37 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Seriously, separate the db from internet facing services. Never never make you db internet accessible


[09/17/2022 1:38 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Only internet facing should be ui abd stratums. All else make private


[09/17/2022 1:38 PM] Elemental#9509
hmm. So would you recommend the 3 VPS to divide everything up or would 2 be sufficient enough?


[09/17/2022 1:39 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
You could do 2.  One for public, the other private.

it‚Äôs all dependent on risk but usually don‚Äôt recommend putting db all in one of you are serious


[09/17/2022 1:42 PM] Elemental#9509
Also, I was looking at the miningcore website that Koberit linked above, and I was just curious about this:
```
1x Server with 4 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM and 100 GB SSD (Master & Database)
1x Server with 2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM and 100 GB SSD (Coin Daemon/Node)
1x Server with 2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM and 40 GB SSD (Stratum)
```
I noticed that #2 and 3 were separated, doesn't miningcore combine the node and stratum into one anyways? or am I missing something here?


[09/17/2022 1:43 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Nope you should keep node separate. Only port 9053 should be internet facing


[09/17/2022 1:44 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Don‚Äôt expose your node api


[09/17/2022 1:44 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
You can run in same server as MC but again depends on your security risk tolerance


[09/17/2022 1:45 PM] Elemental#9509
Also what's the actual difference between 1 and 2? I assumed postgres was used alongside the node, but is postgres actually meant to be separate?


[09/17/2022 1:46 PM] Elemental#9509
oh no yeah I'm willing to spend a bit more for the other 2 servers if they're necessary but I'm just trying to understand the real usage/purpose behind each of them


[09/17/2022 1:47 PM] Elemental#9509
honestly. I'm really surprised that no one has created an in-depth tutorial (yt vid) on setting up miningcore, and explaining the purpose/usage of each VPS, just yet üòÖ


[09/17/2022 2:06 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
In ergo, we are probably the one doing the more extensive deployment of mc that I‚Äôm aware.  I‚Äôve been meaning to do something like that but not enough time.


[09/17/2022 2:06 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273

[09/17/2022 2:11 PM] Elemental#9509
yeahh I remember asking you a while about it for one but didn't wanna pester you about it because you seemed like a busy guy üòÖ but I mean if you genuinely want me to ping you about it or something at random times, I can do that, so long as you're okay with it lol


[09/17/2022 2:11 PM] Elemental#9509
and yeah mc seems like such a great project, but it just needs some more attention/dedication towards it


[09/17/2022 6:18 PM] Balvand#0653
so do you guys recommend running external stratums for miningcore? or am i misinterpreting


[09/17/2022 6:28 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
No, MC is the stratum. It‚Äôs the only thing that should be reachable from internet

@KOBERIT anything is possible, it's just how much work do you want deal with migrating when the time comes üòâ


[09/17/2022 6:33 PM] Balvand#0653
I would say it's easier to separate everything on potatoes so when the time comes you can just power down add resources and spin back up with minimal changes


[09/17/2022 6:34 PM] Balvand#0653
this also gives you the benefit of helping optimize services/queries, for example, if you are adding/altering psql statements for features, it is much easier to assess "expensive transactions" on an isolated machine


[09/17/2022 6:35 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Yes but will cause your pool to go down


[09/17/2022 6:35 PM] Balvand#0653
both miningcore and psql, and even the ergo node are memory heavy


[09/17/2022 6:36 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Getting psql right is the most critical part.  Otherwise moving data takes long time

[09/17/2022 10:43 PM] Elemental#9509
Yo @AllCloudy | GetBlok.io so if #3 is MininingCore (the stratum), and #2 is the Node. What is the Master & Database supposed to be? Is that where we are supposed to keep postgres? I originally assumed postgres was a part of the stratum, but now I'm kinda confused


[09/17/2022 10:44 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Yeah.  Master is if you deploy mc in relay mode. Don‚Äôt worry about that now


[09/17/2022 10:46 PM] Elemental#9509
So just to clarify, the Master & Database IS where we keep Postres, correct?
(ik you just said yeah but just wanna make sure you're not agreeing to the "part of the stratum" bit lol)


[09/17/2022 10:46 PM] Elemental#9509
Also, what does relay mode do for me again? Or where could I find more information about this if you don't mind me asking üôÇ


[09/17/2022 10:49 PM] Balvand#0653
There is basically no documentation on relay mode from my research


[09/17/2022 10:49 PM] Elemental#9509
Also, if yes that Postgres IS the Master/Database, do we need anything else in there other than Postgres? or is that all that's required?


[09/17/2022 10:49 PM] Balvand#0653
Postgres = database


[09/17/2022 10:59 PM] Elemental#9509
Oh okay just making sure. So to clarify what I need


[09/17/2022 11:01 PM] Elemental#9509

VPS 2) Coin Daemon/Node (Node)
VPS 3) MiningCore (Stratum)

Hey @Elemental I applaud you trying but if you are not familiar how to run a database and system administration functions, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend you run a pool.  You are exposing yourself to a lot of risk with other peoples money.  It‚Äôs not for the faint of heart and you really need good IT and infrastructure background to do it right and securely.

[09/17/2022 11:54 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273

[09/17/2022 11:55 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
we learned some hard lessons, even lessons which I had to pay miners out of pocket because of those growing pains.  Miners do not forget, and it‚Äôs really tough to keep it going.  It‚Äôs not a get rich quick scheme.


[09/17/2022 11:55 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Again, if it‚Äôs for your own use, just put it on a single machine and keep mining on


[09/17/2022 11:56 PM] Elemental#9509
I'm aware of and willing to take the risks. Can't get anywhere without taking chances üôÇ And I am familiar with using databases but I'm just not familiar with splitting a mining pool between multiple servers


[09/17/2022 11:57 PM] Elemental#9509

"Miners do not forget, and it‚Äôs really tough to keep it going.  It‚Äôs not a get rich quick scheme."
very true words. running a 24x7 service is not easy, and basically impossible if you've never done basic sysadmin in the first place. there are no off-hours to fuck around and fix things without jeopardizing availability. 
and you can have 1th/s on ergo with a 1% fee and it won't even pay rent so definitely not a get-rich quick scheme for sure


[09/18/2022 12:35 AM] Elemental#9509
Soo either of you guys able to walk me through it by chance? I'm currently running Ubuntu 22 if that matters, but I also noticed miningcore doesn't have a 22 options when building the server. It seems they only have 20 and 21 so I'm not sure if that'll affect anything but I assume I just build the 21 version on my 22 server?

I would stuck with 20.04 if I were you.  The command above is pretty much it to build the MC stratum but you need to build your postgres db first and load the schema


[09/18/2022 2:44 AM] Elemental#9509
why 20.04 if I may ask?


[09/18/2022 2:52 AM] Elemental#9509

So I seem to be making progress now on my 1 VPS on Ubuntu 20.04. I installed postgres, then installed mining core and built ubuntu-20.04.sh, then I typed the following commands:
```
sudo -u postgres psql

CREATE ROLE miningcore WITH LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'your-secure-password';
CREATE DATABASE miningcore OWNER miningcore;
```
I changed the password of course, then I typed \q, but now I seem to be stuck when trying to import the database schema and I'm not entirely sure why because I checked the location and this file is confirmed in this location
```
# I am currently on this command

sudo -u postgres psql -d miningcore -f miningcore/src/Miningcore/Persistence/Postgres/Scripts/createdb.sql

what is the proper way to handle node updates with miningcore? I was able to simply hot-swap a single-node-miningcore install from 4.0.4 to 4.0.45 with no issues on the node's behalf, but it caused miningcore to hang on a block, and upon rebooting/restarting the miningcore server, I was getting exceptions pictured here:

[09/20/2022 2:24 PM] Elemental#9509
what if I have plans to add more than one coin?


[09/20/2022 2:24 PM] Elemental#9509
also quick question. How would I go about creating a config.json file in Ubuntu?


[09/20/2022 2:24 PM] Pgr456#1839
Then you need to only run this on a clean db:
sudo -u postgres psql -d miningcore -f miningcore/src/Miningcore/Persistence/Postgres/Scripts/createdb_postgresql_11_appendix.sql

and for each pool/coin you want to add this:
CREATE TABLE shares_mypool1 PARTITION OF shares FOR VALUES IN ('mypool1');


[09/20/2022 2:25 PM] Elemental#9509
just to clarify, I replace "mypool1" with the coin name, correct?


[09/20/2022 2:25 PM] Elemental#9509
or what exactly is a proper example of what it's supposed to be?


[09/20/2022 2:26 PM] Pgr456#1839
no with the pool id you are going to set in config.json


[09/20/2022 2:26 PM] Elemental#9509
what's an example, if I may ask?


[09/20/2022 2:27 PM] Elemental#9509

also thank you for assisting me so efficiently. I'm kinda passing out rn so really appreciate it üôÇ


[09/20/2022 2:27 PM] Pgr456#1839
If you look at the example config here: https://github.com/oliverw/miningcore/wiki/Configuration
"pools": [
        // Repeat the following section for multiple coins
        {
            // DON'T change the id after a production pool has begun collecting shares!
            "id": "dash1", <-------- this is the id you need @Elemental 
            "enabled": true,
            "coin": "dash",
            // Address to where block rewards are given (pool wallet)
            "address": "yiZodEgQLbYDrWzgBXmfUUHeBVXBNr8rwR",

Normal text editor should work. If you have only access to commandline try: nano config.json

[09/29/2022 8:49 AM] Balvand#0653
it separates the boys from the men üòâ 
you must have a reverse proxy sitting between mining core API and the client frontend which calls it that is capable of handling the SSL for you, because miningcore has no support for HTTPS natively. modern browsers yell at you for mixed content types, which is why your front-end will yell at you even if it's served over HTTPS, because it's trying to pull that unencrypted API over HTTP and that is bad practice


[09/29/2022 8:51 AM] Balvand#0653

Hi, with the last available version 4.0.101, is there any change needed in the ergo.conf file? I've upgraded my node, and it has been syncing since then, for more than one hour. In my last upgrades, the sync happened very fast.

I have a complaint regarding this group. what is the point of having a dedicated channel for people who want to have a pool if nobody helps, nobody collaborates and laughs at you? They only respond to people who are very knowledgeable about the subject. Let's see, let's think among all, if I had a lot of knowledge I wouldn't be here right?. When you ask something basic that you don't understand, they answer you wrong! it is a constructive criticism, it would be very good if they understood that the people who join, it is because "they are just starting", be patient, know how to understand, know how to listen, and remember that it would be great if we all helped each other, the community would grow exponentially .

hello everyone... I am a little disappointed, and I am already thinking that my pool has some configuration problem, I currently have 60 ghs of hashrate and 4 days ago a block has not come out... is it normal??


[10/28/2022 8:47 PM] Balvand#0653
effort variance on a block by block basis can be very substantial. 60 gh/s is only 27 blocks / month on average, but this doesn't mean that you are guaranteed blocks, it's only the statistical expectation. you can have blocks which take 2,3,4,5x or more the expected time.

https://2cryptocalc.com/erg-mining-calculator?hashrate=60000#solo-mining-calculator


[10/28/2022 8:48 PM] Balvand#0653
also if more hash comes online, difficulty changes, the calculation is always varying


[10/29/2022 8:47 PM] DishBrain#1197
Are you sure no blocks have come? I just recently found out/figured out, that the block rewards do not automatically go into whatever wallet you had set up in the Node GUI.  Though, you should still see the amount of ERG shown in that wallet section regardless.

Anyway, turns out that the Node generates a mining specific wallet address where the 57 ERG of the block will be held (45 ERG that would be yours, and 12 that gets submitted back to the re-emission thingy).

if you go to the Swagger UI, be sure to authorize with the botton at the top with your API Key, and go to the /mining/rewardAddress and click to expand, click "try it out" and then "execute". The response will be a wallet address starting with 88. Put that into ergo explorer and see if there's any ERG in it.


[10/29/2022 8:50 PM] DishBrain#1197
I found that out, and then from the Node GUI, I went to the Wallet section and in Payment Send I just tried sending 5 ERG to my personal wallet address (which is the one I had imported into Node and had set as my wallet address in the start.js file of ErgoStratumServer). And then when I went to the transaction in ergo explorer I saw that a transaction happened from that 88 wallet address to my personal wallet address which contained transfers of the 5 ERG I sent myself, and also the remaining 40 ERG as well. It also showed it sending the 12 reemission ERG to wherever it needs to go.


[10/29/2022 8:50 PM] DishBrain#1197
I'm sure there's programmatic ways to set this up, but I haven't bothered to put in the time to do that work yet.

Hello people, sorry for bothering you, I am currently using miningcore, and I have 100/110 ghs in the pool... it turns out that we are not even close to the estimated number of blocks... could it be that the vardiff is influencing not being able to obtain blocks? The average of the pool is still 55 ghs, will that also have something to do with it? And if it is not those things, what could be affecting it? I can't believe it's just luck.

calculate luck of the pool properly, and see if it differs too much on the run of 100-200 blocks from 100-105% then there is a problem

see how many shares your miners solve, and calculate how many blocks u found (with their difficulty as number of shares u need to solve to get solution)


[11/01/2022 7:38 PM] AIunic#4160
divide one by other, u see the luck

late reply, but this was happening to me the other day trying to build it on bare metal on an old dell. i recommend looking into building it with docker, as running it in a container worked on the problematic machine for me. hope this helps.


[11/04/2022 9:28 PM] Balvand#0653
more peers is good, as long as it is within your bandwidth constraints and not driving up costs that way etc. 
when your daemon finds a valid block, it propagates this block, or distributes it, among the connected peers it has. they then distribute it to their peers, and so on. other miners start mining on top of your valid block solution, making new blocks and therefore confirmations, solidifying your block is a confirmed block on the ergo mainnet üôÇ


[11/08/2022 4:58 PM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
@AllCloudy | GetBlok.io - do you know if its possible in miningcore to have a solo and a pplns ergo pool **AND** have the hashrate of the solo pool go into the pplns pool?  Obviously the solo miner, if he hits a block would get the full payout.

I don't think that is possible in MC from the code searching I have done.


[11/09/2022 2:24 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Uh no, that doesnt make sense.  But not that I know of


[11/09/2022 2:31 AM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
There is some rumor going around that the big pools do this or report it that way to miningpoolstats


[11/09/2022 7:57 PM] Balvand#0653
you can see miningpoolstats aggregating solo and pplns pools hash together -- it does not make sense and honestly shouldn't be done if you ask me; it is reporting a time-to-find that neither pool will meet, barring some lucky streak on a localized timeframe. I don't want to name any names but if you need an example you can PM me, not hard to find out either way

Assuming this thing is good:  https://github.com/oliverw/miningcore   i'm using the ErgoStratumServer but then, i don't really have a portal or a payment processing solution ... also had some issues with that vardiff algo on ErgoStratumServer


[11/10/2022 3:02 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
The aggregation is done by miningpoolstats not the pools. It‚Äôs just pulling both api data


[11/10/2022 3:23 AM] Balvand#0653
yes that is true, i didn't mean to say it was the pool operator's fault - by default when you submit a miningcore api to that website it will separate them, however


[11/10/2022 3:24 AM] Balvand#0653
it's a minor inconvenience at worst, no worries really üôÇ


[11/10/2022 3:25 AM] Balvand#0653
miningcore will handle stratum and payment for you out of the box. it has no UI and some features require implementation or enabling, but it is probably the best open-source starting point if you ask me

look in your ergo1.json config on line 18 for the value "integrated" ?


[11/13/2022 8:18 PM] Balvand#0653
i can't tell - but if you're on windows I wouldn't even bother btw


[11/13/2022 8:18 PM] Balvand#0653
it's not a supported production environment so why develop in it, is my reasoning


[11/14/2022 12:24 PM] cannon#3541
So is it based on miningcore code or something a pool operator (yours for example) is setting in parameters and being interpreted a certain way by mps? Some pools show solo vs pplns on mps while pools have all their options aggregated. Thanks in advance!! It only takes a click from pool landing page to ascertain typically, but I've always been curious why there's a discrepancy (so to speak)


[11/17/2022 2:33 PM] MaMa#7975
can i pm u mate? m not using windows, using ubuntu 18


[11/17/2022 5:53 PM] Balvand#0653
sure


[11/17/2022 9:47 PM] Balvand#0653
why is ubuntu 18 a necessity, btw? miningcore only has build scripts labeled for 20.04, 21.04, and 22.04 perhaps there is a reason for that


[11/30/2022 3:20 PM] bambi#6770

@Wolf9466 saw adaverse mention you in his video, wondering if you know if there's a way to calculate TTF (time to find) for Ergo based on network difficulty and hashrate?


[12/07/2022 9:02 PM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
Hi guys i'm having some problems with my ergo node paying out.  I've asked in a couple different rooms here and I haven't been able to get any support.


[12/08/2022 3:18 AM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
@Cheese Enthusiast  - Sorry I have to ask you this, but there is a lack of information out there.   I believe we had our first orphaned block on the pool... basically it's stuck in pending and after talking with one of the developers here Glasgow he said the  mining address ( starts with 88) was 2 miners.  SO i'm assuming that means we have an orphan.  Ok that's fine.

My question is when setting up miningcore, do you use the 88 address from the /mining/rewardAddress endpoint? As the miningcore pool address and the rewardRecipient address?  I've always used the main wallet address.

Thanks


[12/08/2022 3:34 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I believe it's just the normal address, not the 88 one. Would have to double check though


[12/08/2022 3:34 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
The node itself handles the emission transaction and posting of rewards to the correct 88 address, so miningcore doesn't really need that info


[12/08/2022 3:36 AM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
There must be something going on with this new V5.0.4 node or something, miningcore keeps the block in "new" instead of marking it as an orphan


[12/08/2022 3:38 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Miningcore uses the node to confirm the block, is your node synced to the latest height?


[12/08/2022 3:39 AM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
yes, we had two blocks confirm after the 'orphan' block


[12/08/2022 3:40 AM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
block height 890065
https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/blocks/21deb81fa7b1111019efe3e5d27d0e10b7148c34a931a1f058b48ff8bc0c980a
( which i have no idea how the developer knew that went to  2miners)


[12/08/2022 3:41 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Hmm not too sure then, could be a variety of issues like something with the db, api, node, etc. I would just mark it as orphaned for right now and watch to see if it happens again.


[12/08/2022 3:41 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Each pool has a unique 88 address, so you can tell which pool mines which block if you know them by memory


[12/08/2022 3:42 AM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019

Hello, I have a big issue with the ergo node of my pool, it seems it mines blocks but nobody sees it except itself... The last 5 blocks my pool mined are only visible on the node pool, and the node is acting normally unless I'm trying to pay these blocks to miners


[12/17/2022 1:43 PM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
This is the faulty node with the wrong balance:

Looks like it's corrupted. Resync from scratch.


[12/22/2022 10:37 AM] glasgowm#9381
Not enough details here for anyone to help you.

conf file?

Did you check the blocks are yours?

[12/22/2022 10:38 AM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
but it was resyncing from scratch since 2 days, it didn't even finished!!


[12/22/2022 10:38 AM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
I didn't had the time to check, data got corrupted I had to resync from scratch!


[12/22/2022 10:38 AM] glasgowm#9381
I dont see how that is relevant? It can happen during unexpected shutdown, are you using some old HD?


[12/22/2022 10:39 AM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
I have 2 nodes on 2 VPS


[12/22/2022 10:39 AM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
both have the same issue


[12/22/2022 10:39 AM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
it is the only node that have this kind of behaviour


[12/22/2022 10:40 AM] glasgowm#9381
common denominator is you, what is the same about the 2 nodes?


[12/22/2022 10:40 AM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
it's on docker


[12/22/2022 10:40 AM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
can't say, I didn't have this issue before the 5.0.2


[12/22/2022 10:42 AM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
during unexpected shutdown? the nodes crash like every 2 minutes at least while resyncing! the probability it happens is very high then üòë


[12/22/2022 10:42 AM] glasgowm#9381
What vps? Most VPS providers block nodes as cryptocurrency mining


[12/22/2022 10:43 AM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
at OVH


[12/22/2022 10:43 AM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
they are not blocking mine


[12/22/2022 10:43 AM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
they block the mining, not nodes


[12/22/2022 10:44 AM] glasgowm#9381
gCloud will shut down your node and cause the error above. OVH should be fine tho


[12/22/2022 10:45 AM] glasgowm#9381
Something wrong with your setup then, this doesnt happen usually.


[12/22/2022 10:45 AM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
so it's wrong but just since the v5.0.2? what changed??


[12/22/2022 11:14 AM] glasgowm#9381
Not sure but nobody else reporting the same. Are you on the latest v? Search your logs and submit an issue.

https://docs.ergoplatform.com/node/install/troubleshooting/


[12/22/2022 12:03 PM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
I'm on the v5.0.4


[12/22/2022 12:04 PM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
I reviewed my conf deployment of docker swarm, and I tried to change how it handle the reboot after the node crashes, to avoid some kind of parallelism


[12/22/2022 12:05 PM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
it shouldn't have been an issue, as all my services, including databases, are using this way of deployment, and it never has been an issue, but I don't have any idea of what it breaks so...


[12/22/2022 12:43 PM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
just guessing, I had absolutely no log about the crash, so I just expended the ram allocated to more than 2GB (I've put max 4GB), and it is not crashing anymore. I had a docker error 137, meaning OoM for the container. Maybe you should change this page: https://docs.ergoplatform.com/node/install/docker/ because it is obviously wrong in the deployment details.


[12/22/2022 1:22 PM] glasgowm#9381
max heap size is specific to machine based on specs/distribution. 4-6 is usually recommended but if 2 works for you then go for that.


[12/22/2022 3:26 PM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
sure, but as I was using the example of the doc, that is using the official ergo docker image, so I don't mod anything here, and there is a deploy section in the docker compose example. The thing is that section is specific to docker swarm deployment, and I bet that not so much ppl use it but me, so it just get ignore when using it with docker compose. I can recommend u either to change it with a working value or to remove this section, as this is a non working example

Is there a way to add trusted peers to the node, that won't get evicted after a while?

Also it looks like after a while all the connections from the peers are Incoming. Is this okay?


[02/05/2023 6:05 PM] deathgripson#2395
Dont add your address there just note out the contents of the reward recipients object. Add your address right above there where it says ```"address": ""//Address to where block rewards are given```

[02/05/2023 10:35 PM] fantom#7219
Ok so I will have to make a bot that manually sends out mined ergo to wallets of the miners? "mined ergo" - "my commission fee" = "ergo sent to miners' wallet" since I (the pool owner) will be receiving 100% of the block rewards?


[02/05/2023 10:50 PM] deathgripson#2395

Hi there! I'm developing a pool, and I'd like to set up a couple of Ergo nodes for that. Can I somehow make them all share the same rewardAddress? I tried to copy keystore directory around, but Swagger endpoints show different addresses


[02/28/2023 2:58 PM] deathgripson#2395
are they all using the same API key? They would have same address if they did. Also IDK if you can run multiple nodes w the same address at once on my end it caused some issues


[03/01/2023 9:15 AM] charlie-wasp#7322
what kind of issues, can you please elaborate?

and how API key affects wallet? It seems weird üôÇ


[03/01/2023 7:14 PM] deathgripson#2395
Yea running same exact node instance lead one of the nodes to stop running properly then when it restarted its index or db would get corrupted


[03/01/2023 7:16 PM] deathgripson#2395
and yea I could be wrong but I dont think I am here, when trying to recover my node on another PC I tried to use a different API key the first time and got a completely different pubkey for my main address but when I use the same API key I can recover it normally therefore I conclude that the API key helps set the private key values. It makes sense if you think about it, they API key itself is required to do any serious calls to your wallet
