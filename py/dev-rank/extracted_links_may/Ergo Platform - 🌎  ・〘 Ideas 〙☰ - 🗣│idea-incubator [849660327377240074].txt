I wanted to hear some community feedback from ergonauts.

Drop your ideas, thoughts comments.

What would you like to see built on Ergo?

What solutions or topics would you like to see teams teach at ergohack?

Who knows... A dev team might read your idea and do something with it üòé

Topics proposed already for the hackathon below.

* Visual tool for constructing multi-signatures
(This could be a good first step for visual tools to construct more complex scripts)

* Tokenization schemes

(Decentralized ownership is a good way to distribute wealth, how can it be done in a fair manner?)

* Tools for NFTs

(A smart contract for a lottery selection from a numbered lot.)
(Have a collectible section to the auction house or a way to group by policy so that the auction house isn't overwhelmed by these 1/10,000 pieces)
(Group Minting of NFT‚Äôs Allow minting more than 1 under the same policy)

* Applications for data notarization and names registration

* Stealth addresses pool implementation
(stealth pools)

* Applications on top of mixer API

(stealth dApps) 

* More data connectors for the oracle pools
(expanding oracle date computational ability)
(expand the number of oracle pools)

* Improvements to ErgoScript 

(not all the ErgoTree features are projected into Ergoscript)

* Improvements to Ergo AppKit
(basic library for constructing transactions and building off-chain logic on top of for Java and JVM languages)

* Improvements to Ergo Node Interface and - Ergo Headless dApp Framework 3
(improvements to the basic library for constructing transactions and building off-chain logic with Rust)

* Applications on NiPoPoWs

This is one thing that would require plutus coding as well and may only require Eego as an oracle but I think it is a really good idea.

Staking ADA pays rewards every epoch, and spending ADA has transaction fees. These constant financial incentive to save ADA make it harder to justify spending.

Enter the Layer 2 Nano sidechain, wrapped Nano and the Cardano-Nano Oracle powered by Ergo. Nano is fast, feeless and very eco friendly. It‚Äôs feelessness and speed makes it an incredible asset to be used as a cash like reward. It provides excellent liquidity.

The problem that Ergo could solve here is providing an Oracle to check the relative value of NANO-ADA. This (coupled with Nano as a layer 2 blockchain and wrapped asset) would enable Cardano Stake Pool Operators to offer Nano in lieu of ADA as a portion of a staking reward.

Each epoch, a smart contract is generated between the participating stake pool operator and the delagator. The function of that contract is to define what % of the delegators staking reward will be provided in Nano.

At the end of an epoch, the value of Nano is calculated based on the Oracle‚Äôs information. And that amount sent to the delagators wallet as liquidity.

This may require a Nano stable coin like smart contract or perhaps even one for each stake pool operator that wants to participate in the program to ensure efficient use of the code.

This idea sees Nano as essentially a public service. It financially incentivized the Cardano network operators to support Nano, as delagators would be willing to forgo some of their ADA for Nano.

Tools for NFTs:

    Creator's account/page linked to their address: this helps with authenticity (you see who you're buying from, avoiding scams), and helps creators build their brand image.

Without these, artists won't feel encouraged to actively participate in the Auction House as it would keep them anonymous.

    Being able to save your favorite creators, browse all the NFTs they have up for auction with one click, and (ideally) get notified when they have something new up for auction,: increases retention, customer engagement and repeat purchases
    Newly auctioned NFTs could be shown as small icons/previews in the empty space between "Active auctions" and the "New Auction" button.

This gives more exposure to newer auctions, which otherwise would only appear on the main page when they're closer to end (because the default sorting option is "lowest remaining time".

Of course people could sort by "Latest bids", but showing them as previews in that empty space would a) optimize empty space, and b) avoid users from clicking multiple times (i.e. more efficient user experience)
```

I know it seems cheesy and overdone but I think a simple Ergo lottery could bring in a lot of users.
Make it provably fair using the blockchain to randomize and select the winners. Most smart contract platforms have at least some sort of lottery/gambling related dapp. Rather than focus on gambling, I think a lottery is 'safe' enough that it wouldn't tarnish the projects reputation. You could even use some of the proceeds to donate to charity or the BPSAA or other decentralization efforts.

Maybe additional defi projects like lending/borrowing, integration with CEX to get more liquidity for trading. Lastly, projects that comes out of any of our hackathon or other ergo event should be part of our future launchpad project where ergo holders should have an opportunity to invest in these projects early on not venture capitalist or whales.

Hey everyone, my team has an idea for the hackathon that's basically a platform for making mutual funds that invest in various user-specified cryptos using the Ergo DEX, which I see is still in development but has a CLI. It would provide useful functionality for anyone who wants to pool funds into their own diversified portfolio, and I haven't seen anything like this on any other blockchain (the closest I've seen is crypto20.com, which doesn't allow users to make their own indexes). We have a frontend and backend developer and are planning on making a proof of concept or at least presenting the details of how it could work on Ergo. Any thoughts or feedback is welcome!

So someone could make their own index, and others could join if they like the spread? What's the benefit of it being a mutual fund?


[06/08/2021 10:44 AM] Vesi Hiisi#2550
I have seen similar ideas, where not having to actively manage own investments, and passive income are used as selling points.

2 (easysh) ideas

- Extend Telegram tip-bot. Combot has a karma rating system, something similar could be implemented (or utilised from combot directly) to award the most upvoted people in the chat a % of ergs from a prize pool each month. Community Marketing Machine üôÇ
-- More elaborate, but https://www.ergoforum.org/t/a-lottery-on-top-of-ergo/137 could perhaps be combined also.
- Discord bot for tips, price queries, etc. I've used RedBot before which is good, There is a 'cog' library for add-ons, and people can make their own cogs fairly simply.

I'm with Lactem¬†

Outside of the financial benefits of decentralized pooled investing at-scale, we see this project as an opportunity to eventually enable trustless atomic swaps across a variety of networks


[06/08/2021 6:24 PM] CryptoTheo#7410
Yeah exactly! Ideally it would be a platform that allows for both -- mutual funds suit some people better because the (riskier) active management style has a potentially higher upside than a passive index


[06/08/2021 11:21 PM] kushti#0978
Mixicles - simple private contracts on top of oracle data https://research.chain.link/mixicles.pdf . Implementation-wise, onchain part would simple, p2p offchain interaction is needed (and would be the most labor-intensive part likely)

Another suggestion for ErgoHack is to have better error messages when script reduced to false.. like what exactly caused it .. more dev oriented but will be useful for general adaption

Good idea, but it is hard to do in v4.x and not worth the efforts. 
It is however make perfect sense to do in v5.x.


[06/10/2021 6:10 PM] Krypto#8713
Yes in most "wealth management" apps people are encouraged - rightly - to split their store of value into self managed and pooled funds.


[06/10/2021 6:14 PM] Krypto#8713
The general problem with this is the atomicity of more complex swaps.  For instance, even as simple a transaction as a motherboard maker hedging against copper and chip prices for a simple 3 scenario hedge (5 is more robust, 7 is pro) might require a half dozen trades. Those all have to be kept open to narrow limits for long enough to line up all trades then they have to all execute or not.  This alone is why big brokerages dominate swaps & why banks view them as not core business for even commercial clients that need to hedge much more.


[06/10/2021 6:15 PM] Krypto#8713
Look how screwed up supply chains are now.  If everyone had hedged both by inventory & investing then inflation would not be up for uncertainty or gouging.


[06/10/2021 6:17 PM] Krypto#8713
Both excellent proposals. The Tip bot is a super friendly entry point.  Imagine also a choice of such bots, each with degrees of personality customized say by stake pools that then compete to make the base bot tech better.

[06/10/2021 6:19 PM] Krypto#8713
So if I run "Aphrodite stake pool" then I customize the bot (ideally libre software license ) to make it super friendly for people who want crypto for, um, "dating".  And if I run Artemis stake pool, I'm targeting preppers.


[06/10/2021 6:20 PM] Krypto#8713
So when you get your first tip you can choose base or trust a stake pool with this low stakes wallet for a while before trusting then with your big stakes.


[06/10/2021 6:21 PM] Krypto#8713
This encourages improving the bot to suggest things of use to different audiences, help set up accounts of interest to different audiences.  But still gives enough control to pull the code license from scammers


[06/10/2021 6:22 PM] Krypto#8713
Need a wiki for these kinds of things, kick em around for a few weeks before coding


[06/10/2021 6:28 PM] Krypto#8713
Indexes are critical to evolve the platform. One thing I would definitely get involved in, is a simple means to make portfolios of mixed stock, bond, fiat, crypto, commodity assets that are well vs poorly placed in case of specific tech events including patent licensing, standards adoptions by specific vendors  & of course breakthroughs.  So you can make an EV index that will go up with EV prevalence.  And a hedge for a specific fiat that should go up as the fiat goes down. The point of doing this with ERGO is that market makers then can treat it directly as an instrument you can buy and then execute a complex order atomically.


[06/10/2021 6:29 PM] Krypto#8713
A few cases showing how cheap this is to do with Ergo vs setting up a hedging indicator index with a bankster, and you'll get fintech people pouring in.

Group minted NFT seems really strategic.  Artists make limited print runs all the time, it's an established paradigm to have print 2/25, 454/1000 often handwritten on the print by the artist who may hand sign it. It also reduces the NFT price to a tolerable amount.  Just certifying existing prints in a provenance system adds value.


[06/11/2021 2:57 PM] sakata#4279
@here seeing as we have so many pairs of hands on board, i thought why not share some ideas for inspiration? what i've been thinking about:
- an extension/integration for ergoauctions that allows the drawing onto a canvas (or some web app) & uploading directly as an auction // functionality to pull & initiate an auction for a tweet
- dice & general randomness games
- p2p escrow
- library for taking payments in erg on a website
- basic social networking using NFTs to represent an account
- basic database mapper contracts (?) for integrating ergo alongside an existing db solution

I have two separate ideas for possible consideration.

1) a Rotating savings and credit association (ROSCAS) or Tanda  ( informal loan club) app. Each member puts $ in the pot and receives the pot every ‚ÄòX‚Äô. I know many people that use this as a method of saving $ , especially when income is low.

1) sports squares app. Based on a ‚Äòsuper bowl square‚Äô format . 2 teams ‚Äòx‚Äô and ‚Äòy‚Äô. 10 columns and rows for 0-9 scores . You can have all sorts of fun with the payouts . Would require use of oracles ( which is far far far beyond my comprehension ) but I think the application and market for this is massive .

They're only used internally for sigmausd at this point afaik. Maybe gravity too but that's yet unreleased. No active development on them. I'd guess once they're a bit more tested there and people aren't working on ergodex there'll be work to make them more accessible.

a lottery


[07/23/2021 3:20 AM] JOFLITO#9983
but instead of a ticket you buy a number of shares on the mining process


[07/23/2021 3:21 AM] JOFLITO#9983
if you mine the block you get the reward


[07/23/2021 3:21 AM] JOFLITO#9983
if you don't then it's the same than any real life lottery/raffle


[07/23/2021 3:22 AM] JOFLITO#9983
I think the best is to wait for the charity raffle and smart-pool projects to finish


[07/23/2021 3:22 AM] JOFLITO#9983
and then find a way to merge them

what do you guys think?


[07/24/2021 1:16 AM] Neuch#0684

Is there an escrow agent service in the ergo ecosystem? I‚Äôve been thinking it may be a good idea to develop.


[08/12/2021 7:46 PM] weirdhousenoisesat837pmeveryday#4778
For instance if I‚Äôd like to swap crypto directly with an individual that I don‚Äôt know, but with some pre agreed parameters (amount, exchange rate, etc)


[08/12/2021 7:47 PM] weirdhousenoisesat837pmeveryday#4778
(Maybe the ergodex will address this in some way)


[08/12/2021 7:51 PM] weirdhousenoisesat837pmeveryday#4778
So seller contributes their asset into an escrow account, and buyer contributes their funds to the same escrow account, and the exchange of assets/funds only goes through if both parties satisfy their conditions


[08/18/2021 4:12 PM] kushti#0978
Who's selling the shares ?


[08/18/2021 4:21 PM] kushti#0978
For onchain assets we have atomic swaps (ErgoDEX is built on), would be good to get escrow services for physical goods (and maybe crosschain ? )


[08/18/2021 4:39 PM] weirdhousenoisesat837pmeveryday#4778
Thank you for the response. Yes, trustless purchase of goods was the use case I was thinking. Although not strictly physical, for example it could be a PDF. I‚Äôm assuming a file is not an on chain asset, but forgive me if I‚Äôm wrong as I‚Äôm relatively new.

[08/21/2021 3:18 AM] JOFLITO#9983
it is like renting hashrate, but a very very small amount


[08/21/2021 3:18 AM] JOFLITO#9983
so it's cheap, with a very low chance of winning, but with great returns, like a lottery


[08/21/2021 3:20 AM] JOFLITO#9983
I think that it could be a merge between the raffle and smartpools


[08/21/2021 3:23 AM] JOFLITO#9983
And that opens up the option to mine for a few hours everyday, some of us have notebooks with GPUs that we use for work and gaming


[08/21/2021 3:24 AM] JOFLITO#9983
so we can only mine once in a moontime and with low hashrate


[08/21/2021 3:24 AM] JOFLITO#9983
pools prefer miners that are steady


[08/21/2021 3:24 AM] JOFLITO#9983

maybe not directly shares, but lets say a 1 in 10^6 chance to mint the block. I don't have a clue of how many shares would that be

It is renting mining hash, but you are obligated to rent solo mining.

I wonder if this idea from Chia whitepaper could be added via a smart contract. Still have some details to work out, but something like this:

I use paper wallets as a backup to storing my coins on a computer. But if someone finds my paper wallet they can basically take everything.
What about smart contract generated paper wallets where you have settings and final say from your device. So like if I have my erg on a password encrypted wallet on my smartphone, and someone grabs my paper wallet, it let's them access those coins but first it has like a 5 day (or optional time length) delay in which time my smartphone is notified via the wallet and I have an opportunity to say "no, that wasn't me, disable that paper wallet." Or, if it WAS me and I lost my phone, I just wait for the time to expire and I get control of that paper wallet back.

It also works if you forgot the password on your phone, just time-delays recovery

Hi! i have a idea -> p2p NFT dex trustless trade plattform. Bob have a NFT, Alice who is a friend of a friend want to buy it from him directly, they reach an agreement on the price, so alice have to send the ergs to bob and trust him will send the NFT. what if the auction house or other make a trustless tool for this and have a little fee over the transaction. i think it would be a lot usefull!


[09/03/2021 4:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
bob put the NFT the PRICE and the only ADDRESS who can buy it, the wallet who can buy it have to send the 100% of the price, if buyer dont send the 100% the trade is canceled, if buyer send the 100% trade is completed, if the buyer send more than 100% trade is also completed and the excedent is sent back to buyer with the NFT in the same tx, if the buyer never send any erg, after X time, the NFT is sent back to owner wallet


[09/03/2021 4:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
i know 0 of dev, but i think it is possible to do and usefull for that purposes, sorry if i am wrong or if this already exists and im doing ridiculous lol

15  Hackathon Projects there for inspiration


[09/09/2021 10:51 AM] morphic#4133
It may be an interesting topic for the hackathon to implement this EIP-0020: Ergo Pay ( https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/pull/37)
There are two parts: 
1) proof of concept online service 
2) proof of concept implementation in Android application.
A team can either do both from scratch, or alternatively, extend existing projects. For example auctionhouse (as online service) and ergo-wallet-android (as Andorid app).

Some ideas for ErgoHack that someone may want to steal from me (I have no time).

    Create an Ergo tipping bot for use on r/erg_miners or other parts of reddit. They have fresh ERG coming in on a regular basis, so might be willing to tip ERG. They also value ERG so would like be tipped in it.
    Create a tool to calculate how much ERG one is up or down by in their wallet only factoring in transactions where they bought SigRSV and coverted back to ERG later. It could also show what they would be up or down by for a specific set of conversions if they completed the conversion back to ERG now.
    Get really creative and come up with an alternative earning model for investing in DEXes. We need an alternative model that offers a way to avoid impermanent loss. I don't want to see any comments saying this is not possible. I'm not saying it is or is not possible, but many things that seemed impossible in the past have been figured out. I'm just suggesting it is worth trying to come up with something. Impermanet loss is terrible, and for the most part, the people who are willing to take on that risk are the ones who don't fully understand it. With impermanent loss, if the coin goes up in value, you lose and if it goes in value you lose. You are almost guaranteed to lose except for with stable assets. That's my point, it's a broken model for the liquidity provider.


[09/10/2021 12:28 AM] manansh#7167
Wanted to run an idea by you guys. I was thinking about cool ways we could get the community more involved and onboard new users. I was thinking we use a similar model to what coinbase earn does (https://www.coinbase.com/earn).

Have users complete & learn about Ergo for a small reward. Similar premise to (1729.com)

The benefit is that we give people an excuse to participate in our ecosystem while educating them. For ex: One task may be to install a Yoroi wallet. After completing the task, they now have the wallet and have funds in it. We have removed the friction people may have without an incentive like this. They are now free to engage with other dApp's etc.

I have created a quick mockup on figma: https://www.figma.com/proto/cVu5S4g4QvtGsvYIdVgNxt/ERGO-Platform-Copy?node-id=668%3A212&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=668%3A212&show-proto-sidebar=1&hide-ui=1

Let me know what your thoughts are and what possible constraints you guys see. I feel like this would be a great marketing / onboarding tool to have.


[09/10/2021 3:09 AM] jahnreektor#4775

Hi there! I just want to bring an idea for hackathon. Or maybe for private dev who may be interested in it. Imagine a smart-contract that will reveal a secret string to the first owner of NFT with certain value. For example if I buy NFT for 100usd (above threshold preset in smart contract) I will additionally receive kinda token with a secret string in it. I‚Äôm not a dev, sorry. Is it possible?


[09/11/2021 1:39 AM] tryv1#3141
I think it's a great idea. I was able to get a couple of my friends into crypto through the Coinbase earn program which is very newb friendly.

Hello guys! I have a problem with my wifi smart plug, it uses 3rd party app and I don't know if it's going to be around in the future. Same for my wifi 360 degree camera bulb. Wouldn't it be nice if I could access those through a dapp?  Maybe it could handle storing data also (camera data and power monitoring data), but encrypted, so only me would be able to access those. 

Are we going to touch the Internet of Things industry? I think huge potential there! Just as an example...


[09/15/2021 1:17 PM] glasgowm#9381
yes that is a problem those apps are terrible but I would I imagine it's generic proprietary software that no one has bothered cracking


[09/15/2021 1:19 PM] gnuion#3794
yes, because I am also worried about my privacy. I know that my camera data go to a unknown server and I have no guarantee that someone is not observing me right now.

@gnuion what does a dapp solve that a self hosted solution (e.g home assistant) cannot?


[09/15/2021 7:20 PM] boomer#0823
I could see some benefits to having a centralized platform for those 3rd party devices as long as its funded and maintained properly. In the long term, you'd have to choose which devices would fall out of support based on the standards and such you publish.... It'd remove the easy vulnerabilities commonly exploited on the crappy 3rd party apps that those devices ship with but it'd be tough to keep up with all of the models out there, especially when most of those solutions are designed to be as cheap as possible. They wouldn't reach for your platform unless you made it cheaper than what they're already doing. Then you also have the issue of supporting new features to make sure they stay on your platform. I'm also wondering why would you use a dApp?


[09/15/2021 8:58 PM] gnuion#3794
A dApp would be used to provide a universal platform to access the devices that is guaranteed to work for ever. The point of a dApp I think is to make something that can exist on its own. You would not need to maintain the servers and infrastructure needed for a dApp. It's maintained in a decentralized manner by the community. Like the Bitcoin ledger. It does not need a central authority to maintain it.


[09/15/2021 9:00 PM] gnuion#3794
I would like the transition from self hosted to community hosted. I hope I can make sense...


[09/16/2021 6:38 PM] GreenEggsAndSam#7091
Spitballing an idea here: I want to see if building an NFT based login service is an idea that has legs. Anyone heard of something similar on ergo or a different chain?


[09/17/2021 1:03 AM] coop#2582
Not to ruin that, but what application do you seeing this used as? Wouldn't a password manager or 2FA key solve something this is trying to do?


[09/17/2021 2:25 AM] GreenEggsAndSam#7091
Highly transferrable accounts, minimum credentials for accounts, do away with login via Google, fb, LinkedIn, etc. I suppose if someone used the some NFT for a ton of services, it would have the opposite effect by creating a digital identity

An idea I really like is how to utilize a smart contract to initiate another smart contract on-chain for crypto lending through developing trust or a credit system,  crowd funded lending would be able to utilize such to develop a credit system for participating addresses, this I think would allow for crowd funding to move from legacy solutions to Blockchain solutions.

I previously made what's for me a lot of money from Bitcoin purely because my crypto was spread out in a bunch of wallets. some of which were on damaged hard drives that I had to recover and remember the password for. 

So is there a way to make a smart contract where it's difficult to get access but not a time lock you just have to do something really tedious to get in or solve some kind of math problem


[09/19/2021 8:45 PM] Walrus#9577
Maybe solve a Rubik's cube but I'm thinking tedious is better then hard


[09/19/2021 8:46 PM] Walrus#9577

[09/22/2021 3:07 AM] manansh#7167
Hey guys. Give me your thoughts on the following idea.

Is it possible to create infrastructure for an ad displaying application/service? The vision is this. You mint NFT's from a smart contract. Just like you would on Ergo Auction House. However, that NFT has a use case which is that it can be burned or exchanged (whatever makes sense money wise) in return for ad space.

You partner with 2-3 popular dApp's (integrate with their dApp's somehow) and let people display *ergo relevant* ads on there. One use case here is that if you're dropping a new NFT collection and want to get the word out. It's a way to drive traffic to your collection while also incentivizing dApp creators to keep making cool things by collecting a small fee.  

If this makes you want to *throw up* please let me know and make sure to tell me why?

If any devs are interested in teaming up hmu. I am a UX/UI/Interaction designer and researcher and I'm building some mockups rn for fun so I'd love to see if anyone was interested. Adtech is ripe for crypto.

@quokka thoughts?

"Decentralized Casino. I've mentioned this before in the telegram, but would love to see it and believe it would drive adoption to crypto in general.

People can provide liquidity and be the 'house' and others can bet on classic casino games like roulette, blackjack, which all slightly favor the house (like normal casinos).

So if someone plays roulette, hits red and wins they get their winnings, if they lose, it goes to the house rewarding those that provided liquidity.

Could then add sports at some point using oracle pools."


[09/23/2021 10:26 AM] lgd#5847
There's a project on Cardano called Ridotto that does this. You should check that out too.


[09/23/2021 2:38 PM] glasgowm#9381
Sounds interesting, you could make it simpler though I think and basically have a clone of the auctionhouse, with a set fee to mint based on duration. Then you could scrape the page / do an api call and pull the NFTs into participating dApps.


[09/23/2021 6:52 PM] manansh#7167
That is even better. So essentially, the NFT itself would act as the ad. Participating dApps would just need to pull that in and display the NFT itself.

You know if anyone else has the bandwidth for a project like this?

did anyone think how you could solve inheritance problems with blockchain? In a sense that if coin holder X dies, someone can inherit his coins


[09/28/2021 12:51 PM] glasgowm#9381
Storage rent on the blockchain level solves this.

If you mean so a family member can inherit - could do a simple contract that triggers the coins  (or seed phrase)  to be sent if you don't tell it you're not dead every year.

i have a few questions regarding the ideas:
1.  what's the difference between collectibles and group minting (i don't understand it from the explanations)?
2.  i don't understand what is meant with `Visual tool for constructing multi-signatures`
3.  what are stealth pools?
4.  what are stealth dapps?
5.  i don't understand `Ergo DB Mapper`


[09/29/2021 1:34 PM] glasgowm#9381
1. Collectibles is like Ergnomes, group minting would be multiple owners (I think) edit: "(Group Minting of NFT‚Äôs Allow minting more than 1 under the same policy)" - so might be the same thing actually
2. A visual tool to help developers build multi-sigs
3. 'stealth-address based microwallet which sends from the stealth pool to the mixer automatically' (for miners I believe)
4. Applications built ontop of mixer API
5. basic database mapper contracts (?) for integrating ergo alongside an existing db solution

I guess incentivization should be done a bit differently here. Assume that there‚Äôs some Privacy Reward Token (PRT).

thanks for the answers!
1.  Is it possible that Group Minting is having 10 replicas of the same (n)ft?
2.  is that meant as part of the wallet?


[09/29/2021 2:08 PM] glasgowm#9381
1. It could be the same picture and look the same but they'd have a different ID / be a different NFT technically.

An Informal Approach To Specifying Multi-Stage Contracts
Hey there everyone. After taking a stab at designing oTokens recently, I ended up thinking about what the best way to informally write a spec for a multi-stage contract would be. As such, this piece is the result. Please do note that the hyperlinking seems not to work in the forum, but if you check it out on github then you can get the full expe...

Hey everyone. @Leif Erickson, @encode | Eternaeon, @isomorpheric, and myself are going to be building a dashboard that will display your wallet holdings and their value. Any NFTs and tokens you own will be displayed, and if we can pull their value from ergodex or anywhere they're traded, it will be displayed in a graph. You'll have displays for your overall portfolio values and where your tokens are staked, as that functionality begins to come on board.

A fun thing for ergo. May be a platform kind of like twitch streamers... with the base coin being ergo. The content creator can be paid via ergo for streaming. The viewers can earn crypto for the time they are watching on the platform and use it to tip the streamer
Also would tie into the faucet üôÇ unless a coded like miner can be coded in for the viewer like a toggle on thing. üôÇ

Would anyone be interested in creating a sort of mining subpool based on smart contracts? Currently me and my friends all mine on the same pool and to the same wallet address which I currently control. I recently thought about it and realized that my friends shouldn't have to trust me to distribute our mining rewards according to our hashrates. I am quite sure a smart contract should be able to do this and I've already started working on the backend side of things in scala to start creating this.

[09/30/2021 1:18 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I was wondering if this could maybe serve as a first step to the smartpools described in the last ErgoHack. I was also thinking that this could encourage more people with smaller gpus to start mining. I was able to introduce 10 different people to ergo by making this little "subpool" and Im hoping more people would be open to the idea if an algorithm could control the funds instead of a person.


[09/30/2021 1:21 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I also feel like ergo is specifically poised to do well in this type of pool because of the lower hardware requirements and mining temperatures.


[09/30/2021 8:50 AM] Adoo#5093
I want to propose two ides:
1) **Multi Sig Wallet** : A multi-sig wallet with good frontend UI. Multi sig wallet capability exists in Ergo ecosystem but it is not easily usable to an average joe. I have been fiddling with ZK-Treasury code but couldn't get it to work after 5 days of effort. A working and easy to use solution is fairly doable and adds real utility to Ergo users.

2) **Real-World Data for Smart Contracts - Oracle Pool / Other Options** : Currently only USD:ERG oracle pool exists. I am not sure how to even get started to use real-world data for Smart Contracts. In Ergohack, I want to explore how to create a new oracle pool or find alternative way to execute smart contract from real-world data. This effort will be documented in open-source manner so that future developers can use the same construct or improvise it further.

Hear me out:

**Multi-chain liquidity pools.** You pair up similar tokens on different blockchains/sidechains. For example, you pair up BSC USDC:ETH USDC tokens, enabling users to *withdraw* their BSC USDC to an ETH address without paying for insufferable bridge fees. This would require some creative *"multi-chain"* smart contract to pool available liquidity from both blockchains and send them out accordingly, mimicking Binance's approach in withdrawing to different blockchains/networks (this could lead to centralization concerns but this could be worked out ithink). This could also work for L2 solutions such as Polygon or sidechains like Ronin.  Taking the idea further, you could pair different tokens together such as Ergo SigmaUSD:Cardano ADA. 

What do you guys think?

Is there any particular reason you want to use a smart contract and not a normal tx?


[10/02/2021 9:36 AM] Stef#0241
so, i don't have any technical knowledge but i was wondering: is it possible to implement an automatic taxation system within ergo (or blockchains in general) via "innate" smart contracts? like a new node/wallet is created and it's associated with a person (with his/her data stored possibly in a decentralised way), and that node has a smart contract that lasts forever (or for a set amount of time until taxation changes) with the state's node, that makes it send a percentage of the total erg received from other addresses once every set amount of time + a state storage rent to encourage spending. i'm thinking about a possible future time when most transactions globally are made on blockchains and traditional money almost disappears, but states still have to exist and operate in some way


[10/02/2021 9:39 AM] Stef#0241
how can we build cryptos in such a way that help combat evasion in states that work well but at the same time provide an escape if you live in an oppressive state?


[10/02/2021 9:39 AM] Stef#0241
and also how can we make them as much environment friendly as possible

Hello all. Last Hackathon my team submitted SmartPools, an early decentralized mining solution. 

This team my team will be aiming to produce an on chain music streaming/ library platform where artists can share  their audio NFTs, while (ideally) remaining in possession of the NFTs, and listeners can donate to the artists if they so choose, while building their own music library. 

The project is inspired by FunkWhale, an open source federated music streaming platform for Creative Commons licensed music. 

For the Hackathon I aim to produce a whitepaper and ideally function smart contracts (this should be relatively easy, as the auction house contracts can be adapted). 

In the future, light clients can be constructed that allow listeners to download their library from blockchain. 

It would be lovely to merge my team with any others, or have others join my team. üòÉ

idk if it has been proposed before, but I think some kind of "address pinning service" or "ergo name service" would be interesting. 
For example there is https://ens.domains/ for eth. In eth, however, the address is permanent for an account. So the situation with eutxo is a bit different, however one can use the same address for a long time.

Simply, the idea is to build a service in which a user can pin some identity info into an address (or a set of addresses). In action, other services like auction house can query this service (onchain data) to fetch proven identity of an artist, showing identity instead of address.

For developer, implement ergo nft game , smart contract. Play to earn or not, implement game that have ergo.


[10/08/2021 6:09 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
An idea I've been thinking of for the last few days. To create a process of adding more ergo to the maximum supply called prospecting. 

Goals: general increase in decentralization both with ergo hoarding and net hash.  To incentivise ergo mining well beyond the last block reward.

What it's based off? Just like in mining there is an ammount of gold that is known (both mined and in reserve). And there is undiscovered ammounts that could be discovered through very risky ventures that take alot of effort called prospecting.

 How it could work? I picture a few ways this could be implemented. One is combining staking and ergo mining. stakers can stake their coins on ergo mining pools for a chance to create an extra ergo reward shared between the pool and stakers. Pools will have the chace to recieve an extra reward based on their blocks per min. With a higher chance multier given to the pools with lower blocks per minute that have stakers. For some pos coins there could even be a function to burn the coins after the ergo is found or after each epoch making prospecting very risky and only rewarding in the case the ergo becomes too rare. The chance for extra ergo could be increased as more people stake on the network. Creating a market force to increase the ergo supply if the venture becomes rewarding enough to justify.

Note: The goal isn't to turn ergo into a limitless inflationary asses but to give 
small chance with enough market force to increase the ergo supply in the case that ergo becomes to scarce.

[10/09/2021 6:58 PM] g_w87#1147
Another way to think of it or another example - the explorer currently has the rich list, but what are the balances of those wallets over time? Are they holding / accumulating / selling? How are they behaving more or less? I can pull each wallet individually and look at their transaction, but I can‚Äôt figure out how to do that in an automated way


[10/09/2021 7:00 PM] abchris#8522
Since you like SQL, your best bet is to have an instance of the explorer DB running.

That what ergo.watch is based off. If you work with docker, there's images available from the github.

So you need to have a synced node and then have the chain-grabber filling the db. Takes about a day or so.


[10/09/2021 7:39 PM] abchris#8522
If you look into the docker-compose file, you only need the `node`, `db` and `grabber` services.


[10/09/2021 7:39 PM] g_w87#1147
Ok - will first have to set up a node - been meaning to do that

if i understand that correctly you would need to know when you will die to use such contract üòõ


[10/10/2021 12:24 AM] vegycslol#1714
so basically what i would want to have is to have a regular script that locks by address to be `pkA || inherit<pkA>` where `inherit<pka>` would somehow have an additional lock (maybe `inherit<pkA>` could only spend it to create such tx whose unlock is `pkA || inherit<pkA> && height>this_tx_mined+1year` and the wallet could recognize such tx and tell you someone is trying to claim your crypto inheritance and you could just spend it to cancel if it's a bad request üòõ


[10/10/2021 2:50 AM] g_w87#1147
Question as I didn‚Äôt totally appreciate what this link was at first - instead of setting up my own node I can use one of these nodes ?


[10/10/2021 3:36 AM] abchris#8522
Yes, you could use that one instead of a local node. if you plan on running the chain-grabber to generate the explorer db, you'll be querying that node heavily for a while, which might be faster if it's local. The db will be around 40-50GB, to give you an idea.


[10/10/2021 3:41 AM] g_w87#1147
Ok that makes sense - already ordered my a mini pc for a node, but may need to grab an external hard drive for that beast


[10/10/2021 3:49 AM] g_w87#1147
I went through all your documentation as well as the ergo blockchain explorer read me. Following at a high level that ergo watch backend leverages some of those modules to pull data and build the db. Where I‚Äôm stuck is I need the order of operations / how to step guide‚Ä¶. I can DM when I get my node up and running


[10/10/2021 3:50 AM] g_w87#1147
Also went through the db.py file so I‚Äôm definitely following the queries and how they relate to the 3 ergowatch sites!


[10/10/2021 3:54 AM] g_w87#1147
Getting up and running will be my challenge / take the most time‚Ä¶ once I have the raw on chain data I can let it rip


[10/10/2021 4:00 AM] abchris#8522
Yes, the whole chain-to-db train is handled by the explorer's chain-grabber. That's what you'll need to get running once you're done with the node.


[10/10/2021 4:01 AM] abchris#8522
You can run them natively, or in docker containers, whatever you prefer.


[10/10/2021 4:10 AM] g_w87#1147
My preference would be whatever is easiest for a novice!


[10/10/2021 4:12 AM] g_w87#1147
I‚Äôm familiar with databases, but this is more like step or two before I‚Äôm  typically involved if you know what I mean.


[10/10/2021 4:12 AM] abchris#8522
If you've never used docker and are on linux, then go native. If on windows and running into issues trying to compile the chain-grabber, docker might be worth picking up.


[10/10/2021 4:13 AM] g_w87#1147

Hello, just recently I am having some aggravation with eBay. My account got flagged for some reason I don't know, and I am unable to make any purchases. So my idea is, why use eBay at all? Let's have a dApp where payments are settled in crypto and tracking is done also via blockchain. When package gets delivered and the buyer signs its location, this would stratify a smart contract and the seller would get paid.


[10/24/2021 12:17 PM] Herk#6019
just a thought, let's say you buy a gpu and the seller sends an empty box

uhm, it doesn't really work like that, and that was just an example, but generally falls under the "not as described or pictured" on ebay


[10/24/2021 5:55 PM] Herk#6019
which is hard to do even for them and heavily abused


[10/24/2021 5:59 PM] gnuion#3794
It works just like that. If you don't like the item don't accept it. And if you order from  a verified wallet, like from a trusty company you could extend the model to include returns, warranties und refunds. This is the future of money, we like it or not. Future is blockchain.


[10/24/2021 6:11 PM] Herk#6019
not sure where you live but over here if you order from ebay you don't have the chance to not sign it or not accept it.


[10/24/2021 6:11 PM] Herk#6019
I just mentioned the empty box as it happened to me quite recently


[10/24/2021 11:33 PM] gnuion#3794
Then the seller won't get paid without your signature. You don't understand what I am saying.


[10/24/2021 11:36 PM] gnuion#3794
Besides eBay is useless for me now, maybe good just for scraping data. Their stupid algorithm flagged my account and I am unable to buy. Support is very slow and a waste of time really. I got so aggravated I am taking it personal. I urge for an alterative.


[10/24/2021 11:36 PM] Herk#6019

wallet signature.


[10/24/2021 11:38 PM] Herk#6019
so the seller doesn‚Äôt get paid but sends the item first?


[10/24/2021 11:38 PM] gnuion#3794
yes.


[10/24/2021 11:40 PM] gnuion#3794
a smart contract would be used instead of paypal or ebay. and only if the item is accepted by the buyer funds will be released to the seller. otherwise it's a refund to the buyer.


[10/24/2021 11:42 PM] gnuion#3794
If I were smart enough to implement such a dApp myself, I'd be so rich...

Project idea if anyone interested or would be able to make it work.
An investment dapp. Like dragons den (shark tank) on the blockchain. Can be a space for people that want to build projects on ergo and a place for ergo holders to be able to invest in projects they believe in. People could propose an idea or already working on something but require funding. They can offer a share of ownership tokens of their project up for funding (maybe similar to how mixer wants to sell tokens for ownership and share profits) and investors interested in the ideas/projects can offer funds if it's something they are interested in for a share of the company.


[11/07/2021 1:38 AM] Cris7#9283

Proof-of-Work Backed Tokens
This is how useful proof of work can be implemented. When combined with service tokens.  And looks like the idea can be extended to not just tokens but any hash in registers can be used as a nonce. And then once obtained can be checked in contracts.  Very cool.

Hi, wasn‚Äôt sure where to post this in either idea incubator or defi-daps. Not a developer so couldn‚Äôt make this myself so just throwing this out there.I‚Äôve been seeing an uptrend in airdrops from meme contests. Just though of an idea that could maybe help out the coin owners and participants.

Also, thought it just incorporates a few of the auction house and raffle components to make either a new contest site/dapp or ergo raffle can incorporate this into their site. 

Idea would basically be someone sets up a contest were people can post all there memes, videos or anything to. The contest owner can set the parameters for the entry such as how much it costs to post something be it free to post or some unit of coin (erg, sigusd, whatever) (also there could be discussions about if they should be minting there entry like into an nft or just uploading off there computers). 

Then there can be different parameters set depending on how the contest owner would like to conduct the contest.

 I‚Äôve seen a lot of recent, just post your meme and leave your address and i‚Äôll air drop you coins. You can set a parameter that collects your address like raffle and by the end of the contest you get coins from a contract the contest owner sends their coins into. (I feel like this can add some safe of mind to people when the owner puts their coin into a contract vs they hold all the coins and are flipping through posts on reddit or wherever and sending coins individually to the address in the post). 

You can set up how much coins someone gets like 5k for each post until the amount runs out or distribute to each post evenly from the  initial amount the contest owner send into the contract. Or like the raffle, if it costs an amount to post, the contest can collect the amount to add to a pot.

You could also allow for the contest owner to  check a button which allows voting where viewers can come in and vote then top posts by the end of the contest wins an amount.

[12/15/2021 7:16 PM] gnuion#3794
And maybe this would be a good use case for multi pool oracles?

I have an idea. Not sure that now is the time to pursue this, but I was thinking of which communities would benefit most from ergo's values and settled on Native Americans in the US. Those not from here might not know the history so well, but basically the US has destroyed these people and forced them to either live on small reservations or assimilate to american culture. They live today as technically sovereign states, but they face all sorts of challenges (poverty, no healthcare, no education, loss of culture) and rely on the US for lots of things. I think crypto in general could give them a way to take control of their own economic situation and be less reliant on the US govt. This would also give them an incentive to learn and participate in a worldwide economy, when otherwise they have very low participation in stem fields. Lastly... Casinos. Gambling is mostly illegal in the US, save for a few states and on many reservations. Online gambling is almost completely illegal, even for Native Americans despite them being sovereign. I wonder if the mixer could empower them to offer private online gambling to a worldwide audience? Any thoughts?


[12/22/2021 6:13 PM] timreg7#6732
I've found only 2 Native American specific crypto projects, neither has really done anything significant.


[12/23/2021 12:25 PM] gnuion#3794
I wonder how gambling could help Native Americans. Micropayments on the other hand could offer an alternative to the fiat dollar and communities could mint their own currencies. I think a layer two scaling solution for ERGO might be useful as even low transaction fees such as 0.01ERG ($0.05) could be a lot if you buy bread and I don't know the transaction finality. A less secure layer two scaling solution with even lower fees and instant finality could be a solution. I don't know, I need to educate myself more about ERGO.


[12/23/2021 3:17 PM] timreg7#6732
I agree that gambling is not so healthy, but that is how many native communities support themselves (operating a casino, not gambling). People travel to their casinos bc nothing else is legal I'm their area. The idea is that this would get them out from under the thumb of the US govt.


[12/23/2021 3:19 PM] timreg7#6732
I'm thinking there would be many use cases for LETS, I'm areas where tech and other business is limited


[12/28/2021 2:51 PM] timreg7#6732
Another idea: what if we had NFTs for something like Magic The Gathering? Your NFTs have certain properties that allow you to play against others and a website connects to your wallet, allowing you to visualize the game being played.


[12/28/2021 2:52 PM] timreg7#6732
Then you could use smart contracts to wager against people, or host tournaments. Like an 8 person winner take all bracket


[12/28/2021 2:55 PM] timreg7#6732
And on the issuance side, you could sell packs of cards just like irl. You could mint like 10k cards initially with random features according to a specific rarity, just like people do with nft drops. Then after that you can slowly release more cards, like once per month


[12/28/2021 2:56 PM] timreg7#6732
There could be a whole marketplace for the cards to be bought and sold, collecting a small royalty

@AggerGakker  Sync up with @√Ör√ñhB√™  we are actively looking to add on capabilities to the GetBlok.io SmartPool concept, and your idea makes sense - but has some intricacies that need to be explored/discussed.  For example, mine ergo -> get paid in eth? or mine ergo -> get paid in fiat?

My idea was initially just to get it to work with ERGO native tokens


[12/29/2021 7:46 PM] AggerGakker#4449
Since i would be taxed double if i minted SigUsd with my ERGO


[12/29/2021 7:47 PM] AggerGakker#4449

[01/04/2022 1:40 PM] gnuion#3794
it is somehow against the philosophy of crypto if we now somehow are required to submit tax reports. i think the idea was to separate the state and money. And now they are getting your financial data. Getting back to the old bank system.


[01/04/2022 1:52 PM] gnuion#3794
I don't think the definition of privacy should be Banks, The Government and I . But this is what is understood by law. I wonder if we should really adapt to the old system, or just continue defining the future.


[01/04/2022 1:53 PM] AggerGakker#4449
It's actually supposed to reduce the tax footprint by eliminating the swap


[01/04/2022 1:54 PM] gnuion#3794
But it doesn't work for all countries. For example in Portugal trading is a non taxable event. You can't reduce the tax any further.

ErgoAcademy, a static way to teach some interested people with some programming knowledge, easy to maintain, easy to create.
I dont think It would take longer than 2 days for any head developer to think of documentation/videos that would introduce people with certain programming knowledge(my case) to ErgoScript and eutxo programming, and obviously sorting such documentation/videos so that It goes from easier to harder.

[01/06/2022 9:30 PM] timreg7#6732
Ive been thining about non-art NFT use cases. The thing that comes to mind is titles, deeds, registration, etc. This information is already stored centrally, but using NFT's to manage them would likely be much less expensive. There would have to be an onboarding process that includes creating digital identities that are linked to social security numbers, then everything could be associated with that (driver's license, etc). Once people had these, home / car titles could be sent to these public wallets, and identity could be verified without people ever having to share their social security ever again. Like they could cryptographically prove their identity without disclosing their secrets. This could then lead to things like degrees, certifications, & medical records being minted as NFTs, and things would be much more secure.


[01/06/2022 9:31 PM] timreg7#6732
I imaging this would have to be run as a side chain, and all of the UI would have to be built out before you could market it to a state government or something similar

Another idea I had for online games: We could have some pvp game (anything, really) and set up tournaments where people pay an entry fee and get placed randomly in a bracket. Then a smart contract facilitates the matches, advances through the brackets, and pays the winner the sum of the entry fees.


[01/06/2022 11:39 PM] timreg7#6732
Would need some sort of oracle I suppose, idk how that would be executed. but it sounds fun and i'd bet on myself to win a game like checkers, tic tac toe, excite bike... anything. If you could get something like an old school fighting game (mortal kombat, DOA, Tekken, etc) that would be super popular

[01/10/2022 1:49 PM] Chingy Macaroni#3838
Here's an idea I had, but like all ideas guys I have no clue how to implement or if there's enough interest

**-Tokenized Scientific Research and Publishing-**
-Publishing, approved access/references, and funding of research on Ergo Chain
-Use of smart contract/oracle to approve funding payment terms (50% upfront, 50% upon publishing, whatever kind of contract you want as the funder)
-Escrow of funds, could match Erg-Fiat via an oracle in case price swings wildly during the research term. Multisig/voting/change order on research possible via contract
-Anonymous funding and NFT-ified patents or authorship on the paper
-Permanent, uncensored publishing of research
-Encrypted publishing of results available to funders for x years as per contract, if wanted by financier
-Kickbacks for researchers if their paper is cited
-Payment for other researchers for experimentally verifying the research (there is a crisis in reproducibility in published research that this could help) 
-Getting research out from behind a paywall and to the people, where more ideas can flourish.

Also saw your post on the smartpool channel regarding connecting a Dex to get autoswaps and get paid other than in ergo. 
Not a developper myself, but there is a ETH pool taht embrace this concept (prohasing) where you mine what you can with your hardware and get paid in the multi currencies of your choice, in the proportions of your choice, like auto-building a portfolio. Maybe you can check out their pool / website to get an idea on how to implement something similar


[01/17/2022 3:47 PM] AggerGakker#4449
Yes. There's also unmineable and zergpool. But unmineable does it through their own wallet and zergpool through a CEX. With ERGO it's possible to do instant swaps via a dex

Hello, as I have many friends that are not very blockchain friendly and they prefer simple things, most don‚Äôt want to go through exchanges stuff and then create a wallet and then buy NFTs or ERG. (Also Ergo not being in major exchanges is no-no for some). Is any feature in development that will alow users to directly buy Ergo from Yoroi, Ergo Wallet, Nautilius ? Maybe a integration with moonpay, banxa, etc?

Is someone building a TOKEN CHART website like poocoin on ERGO ?  I noticed and addressed this similar issue on Cardano. As the ecosystem grows many tokens will be minted and some basics stats like price over time candles, market cap, holders could help users avoid scams and win a lot of time for investors. Someone asked the same question but related to ErgoDEX on their discord, but I think a separate app for this will be better. Also I don't have the dev knowledge how this can be built if it can, I'm just very intersted in the idea.  :ergo_orange:

How will it be decentralized? I think the verification process makes it hard to de decentralize, like the problems such as if the product arrived or how will be the refund process.

Maybe a similar design to NFT market can be forked with escrow contracts, it can work as P2P commerce platform, then the risks will be on the two ends being trustful


[02/17/2022 9:36 PM] root7Z#8699
Maybe a group of people can run a DAO on top of the e-commerce to take the responsibility of verification and we may expect it being further decentralized when users of the platform get voting power on disputes through the airdrop ü§î

[02/27/2022 3:54 PM] gnuion#3794
Maybe there is a way to mint domain names on the Ergo blockchain with a pointer to a IPFS resource. Not using the traditional DNS system at all.


[02/27/2022 3:59 PM] gnuion#3794
Also, another note, I don't know if it is on the road map, but I would advocate for a more use friendly address. Something the NEAR protocol already has implemented for their blockchain.


[03/02/2022 12:46 PM] HelixEvo#2120
ErgoDNS I think is in the works for address friendliness. As for DNS for domains, are you referring to something like unstoppable domains type of idea?


[03/03/2022 3:07 PM] gnuion#3794
I think of a technology that bypasses the traditional domain resolution system, because by design the traditional DNS is hierarchical and therefor centralized. I don't think unstoppable domain really a solution, as it still operates as a centralized company following the ICANN standard, correct me if I am wrong. I just was shocked to see how centralized the internet really is.


[03/03/2022 3:10 PM] gnuion#3794
Okay, from a quick google search I read that unstoppable domains  are focused on building domain systems that are not part of ICANN.

I've been thinking a lot about this tweet from @Armeanio : https://twitter.com/CuriaCrypto/status/1499903917395611648?s=20&t=gIw9YXwAsiOhBvNwhckRiA

we desperately need an "Umbrel for Ergo" type service (https://getumbrel.com/). 

Setting up a node at this point in time is like constructing a nuclear fusion reactor from scratch with nothing but palm trees and coconuts. if the technically savvy amongst us are facing issues (https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/669989266478202917/918129569272311830) then I can only imagine the frustration levels for a person who is less technically inclined (https://www.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/comments/p2pn3y/my_experience_setting_up_an_ergo_node/).

this would address and solve a number of things:
1) strengthens network decentralization and adoption
2) encourages privacy by interfacing with node instead of 3rd party
3) fast and easy install process to get up and running
4) makes ergo very attractive for new/veterans of the space
5) acts as a "gateway" to other ergo products

Most of these issues have appeared over the past year as the blockchain has grown so much - once UTXO set snapshots are out and we can sync with <1MB this will be much less of an issue. 

This mostly works as a one-liner for UNIX systems and could work with some modifications/testing on WSL I think. 

https://github.com/glasgowm148/ergoscripts/blob/main/sh/install_gui.sh

Further improvements
1. Generate blake2b without starting server
2. Switch to correct jvm version cross-platform
3. Better debugging analysis

this is great...any idea ETA on UTXO set snapshots? i may have to try again getting a node setup on rpi with the above bash script


[03/08/2022 3:42 PM] glasgowm#9381
Think most of the heavy lifting is done in the node and sigma-rust. Full node writing snapshots done 24/11. P2P messages done 19/01 and moving onto bootstrap logic. So hopefully not too much longer.

I'm about to run through the script on my Pi to test will let you know how it goes.

Hey Guys, Looking for a Dev to work on a project i'm trying to get off the ground.  The project has no token, purely smart contract and website UI. If anyone can point me in the right direction I would appreciate it üôÇ


[03/19/2022 3:56 PM] NoahErgo#4349
Post your idea and maybe you can get some traction


[03/19/2022 9:53 PM] Galim81#0252
Hey Noah, As a starting point is is to bring a service similar to Olympus Pro to Ergo, Protocol owned liquidity. 1 additional service that allows projects greater control over their liquidity, treasury and token volatility. (An evolution/expansion on what Olympus pro offers). There is one further service i'm looking at but haven't fully fleshed it out as of yet and I would need to understand if it could be delivered through smart contracts. I have funds to pay for a Dev and also happy to discuss % share. I also have contacts with Dev's that have delivered a similar service on EVM chains. They would be willing to support for a % share, in particular around the front end development.


[03/20/2022 1:25 AM] NoahErgo#4349
You should apply for help from ergopad devs

https://ergopad.io/apply

Even if theres no token involved they can help

Hi all, 

Our team organizes a new hackathon for the ecosystem. However, we see the next event as more extensive and supportive for the ecosystem. Therefore, we would like to increase the time frame for development and engagement. One of the tasks is to provide support for projects, both with additional promo and development.

We want to attract more developers from outside and get them building on Ergo.  To do this it would be appreciated if you could describe any issues or bottlenecks on what you think needs improved to help onboard new devs.  This is an integral part of building up Ergo and in gratitude anyone who submits such feedback will be eligible for part of the ergohack prize pool.

And also each project has the opportunity to participate in our Promo week on the official ergo youtube channel. To do this, you need to record a short video presentation of the project and send it to our video manager Andy (I think that most of you have already received his personal invitation)

I look forward to your feedback, as the idea of the next hackathon aka hack fest (which we will announce very soon) is entirely dedicated to ecosystem projects. 

Please use the typeform answering just 4 short questions, it would be highly appreciated üëáüèΩ

‚Äú‚Ä¶help onboard new devs‚Ä¶‚Äù 

This is my anecdotal evidence but I see messages over discord Twitter and Reddit that many people actually do want to pick up ergoscript and contribute but examples/tutorials are just way over the head of everyone and it goes from 0-100 really quick (even for myself with partial programming experience). The template answer on reddit right now is "sign up for deco" but not everyone can commit to a dedicated set time schedule every week.

The on-ramp needs to be a bit smoother IMO. The information is all over the place. Dav009 has a good starter guide in getting dev workflow setup. But then what? How to start from the most basic parts to a full contract? Again there are examples but the cognitive load to sift through and ‚Äújust figure it out‚Äù is way too high. i have start-stop this learning more times than i can count.

There really needs to be a single resource/guide/tutorial for this that people can use as a jumping point to go down the rabbit hole or reference again in the future. Right now you have to find it on ergo docs, medium, github, etc. This is something I have been wanting to do for awhile but goes back to everything I mentioned above.

yeah I agree & that's what I've been trying to do here - https://docs.ergoplatform.com/dev/

For scala/appkit there's a fair bit, but yeah still very steep. But anything you find on medium/git should be added/relinked here - plan is to have it step-by-step.

PRs/comments always welcomed (I also asked Stacie to push through the bounties requests that were hanging earlier). But yeh - long process. Education partnerships we're working on + whatever we can pinch from DeCo should help push it along a bit again soon.

^Here are my ideas on minable tokens and NFTs on ergo


[04/09/2022 2:04 PM] Mx62#7304
as far as feedback, im curious what R&D has been do so far on PoW tokens, if someone with more advanced cryptographic experience can comment on the security of my proposal, and if RSA decryption can be or is implemented in sigma propositions


[04/09/2022 2:04 PM] Mx62#7304
i know armeanio has been interested in this subject, do i tag him?


[04/10/2022 1:00 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Its an idea we have considered previously at getblok, could theoretically work well with our subpooling concept.


[04/10/2022 1:04 AM] Mx62#7304
are you talkin about the idea in general of minable coins, or the specific use of RSA?


[04/10/2022 1:06 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
We have thought about both, there's ways to make it such that nfts can be provided as tokens on top of normal ERG mining, and also ways to make it so that the work being performed is only useful for mining the NFT itself.


[04/10/2022 1:07 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Theoretically also possible to perform some sort of dual mining set up. Where you set a separate target value that is checked against the hash of the block. Essentially you could mine blocks but then also randomly mine tokens depending on whether or not the hash of the block you mined was lower than the NFT target value.


[04/10/2022 1:09 AM] Mx62#7304
did you read my writeup? if youve thought about using RSA this way, what were the technical challenges?


[04/10/2022 1:09 AM] Mx62#7304
@Cheese Enthusiast


[04/10/2022 1:13 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Have not looked at it thoroughly yet, sorry. From a general overview I wonder if it is maybe a bit more complicated then it needs to be, but that depends on your goals for the project.


[04/10/2022 1:23 AM] Mx62#7304
yeah we could axe the record boxes and some other features


[04/10/2022 1:25 AM] Mx62#7304
the main thing i was curious about is if anyone here had talked about using RSA bruteforcing for mining since it would prevent frontrunning


[04/10/2022 1:34 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Are you worried about miners being able to frontrun the transaction by providing the same nonce in order to spend the box guarding the NFT? I think there are likely easier ways to solve this, for example require two inputs to the transaction. Input 1 being the guarding box holding the NFT, and input two being a box under the NFT miner's pk, that will hold the nonce in R4. The guarding box checks input 2 to see if its box id is less than some target value, and if it is then it will unlock. Now if someone were to try and create a separate box with the same nonce, the box id would be completely different and would not be able to unlock the guarding box.

Didn't put too much thought into this set up so it would still have to be analyzed for security risks, but the general idea seems easier to implement then the rsa encryption you mentioned.

 You cannot run a project in crypto and not have a telegram. People will assume its a scam.

I mean, I'm an american and literally not one person i know uses telegram - not sure how much i believe your statement.


[04/21/2022 5:57 PM] cafebedouin#0000
I, too, am an American and use Telegram because it was literally the only way to get some of my crypto problems solved.


[04/21/2022 5:58 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Whether you believe it or not, the fact that the IDO has it listed should be a clue in it is kind of important.


[04/21/2022 5:58 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Okay, well. I am a business man - Who is getting into the crypto space. Are you saying that having a telegram in the space is like having a linkedin in the corporate one? is it ENTIRELYT neccessary to cultivate a message board just to launch a business, even if it has no plans to be community driven project?


[04/21/2022 5:59 PM] liquid_phase#4605

 If you have users, you'll need somewhere to communicate with them. Discord could work if your clients are IT pros I suppose, but do IT pros outside crypto use Discord? I have no idea.


[04/21/2022 5:59 PM] liquid_phase#4605

[04/21/2022 6:00 PM] cafebedouin#0000
As curbside said, you could leave it off the Ergopad application, but you'll need something to communicate with prospective people you might need to say, buy tokens to launch the project, communicate with devs, communicate with marketing people on your team, etc.


[04/21/2022 6:01 PM] liquid_phase#4605

 Another thing that is common in life is not everyone is going to like you. I'm leaning toward mild dislike. But you seem capable, and I like capable people. If you reign in that ego a bit, we'll probably get along just fine. I voted for you to be added to the sigcans group, saying that you are pain in the ass, but so am I. So, here we are.

[04/21/2022 6:16 PM] cafebedouin#0000

[04/21/2022 6:33 PM] liquid_phase#4605
the company i worked with pioneered the ethanol process line for bulk extraction and distillation for pen cartridges. 

personal preference i choose water hash, rosin, or butane hash when made properly.

the lab i just designed for cosmic gardens, currentlty CTO of this company, is a type 7 extraction lab for hydrocarbons (butane/propane)

 No CO2?


[04/21/2022 6:35 PM] liquid_phase#4605
CO2 is incredibly slow throughput anmd you need co-solvent injection of ethanol to perform winterization of the CO2 crude to make it usable in pens


[04/21/2022 6:35 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
> JŒµnniŒµ D re @Marty: No CO2? 
 
 I don't think he's watched your interviews/amas


[04/21/2022 6:35 PM] Marty#0000
Yeah you do need ethanol winterization


[04/21/2022 6:36 PM] liquid_phase#4605
a co2 system costs a million, needs ASME rating, takes 12 hours to perform what ethanol or butane could do in 2 hours


[04/21/2022 6:36 PM] liquid_phase#4605
its not a good methodology for bulk. and its too expensive for personal


[04/21/2022 6:36 PM] Marty#0000
It's a lot easier to get regulated for CO2 than butane extraction


[04/21/2022 6:36 PM] liquid_phase#4605
the company i built out was Delta Separations


[04/21/2022 6:36 PM] liquid_phase#4605
our ethanol line pioneered the regulation


[04/21/2022 6:36 PM] Marty#0000
Of course if you've already built the butane facility then there's no point


[04/21/2022 6:36 PM] liquid_phase#4605
we merged with apeks supercritical once purchased by gibraltar


[04/21/2022 6:37 PM] Marty#0000
CO2 is beautiful, you get a lot fuller spectrum


[04/21/2022 6:37 PM] liquid_phase#4605
the founder of this company im currently at is highly preferential on DIAMONDS. doesnt want carts or wax.


[04/21/2022 6:38 PM] liquid_phase#4605
CO2 is great for dialing in terpenes, and for specific use cases, when merged with ethanol injection you get some great results - im not questioning it. I m just from the bulk side of getting it done cheaper and faster. CO2 needs some barriers of entry (cost/speed) to come down for it to be production usable


[04/21/2022 6:38 PM] Marty#0000
Btw CO2 doesn't cost a million if you know what you're doing. We built one for $200k w/ 16lb capacity


[04/21/2022 6:38 PM] liquid_phase#4605
id love to have an actual conversation with you on this some day if it is one of your passions


[04/21/2022 6:39 PM] liquid_phase#4605
^ our centrifuge for ethanol did 15 lbs capacity PER RUN (15 minute run time) - up to 450 lbs per working day of cannabis processed


[04/21/2022 6:39 PM] liquid_phase#4605
CO2 just cant touch that


[04/21/2022 6:39 PM] fruittree#0000
honest question, why extracts? When i was quitting weed/drugs like over a decade ago everyone in denver  etc was almost exclusively smoking extracts. Maybe im old but why don't people like to smoke the whole herb anymore?


[04/21/2022 6:40 PM] Marty#0000
Gives you a lot more options


[04/21/2022 6:40 PM] Marty#0000
You can isolate specific flavor profiles, specific highs


[04/21/2022 6:40 PM] Marty#0000
Stores much longer


[04/21/2022 6:40 PM] liquid_phase#4605
I know co2 systems can be made cheaper, and actually once we merghed with apeks supercritical they were working on some cheaper units too - but again, its all about point of diminishing returns for me

Co2 gives you options for terpenes, but those options are now available by using microwave distillation

 Yeah CO2 can't touch that at all


[04/21/2022 6:40 PM] liquid_phase#4605
CO2 extract does not store as well as butane extracts.

id love to talk more about this with you marty (really, i would, because its not often you find people who know how to build closed loop systems, and im sure you can see moreso how my mind operates now that you see im used to dealing with volatiles ands explosives and gray markets  all day) but i am actually pretty busy today. I really am not SEEKING to piss anyone off, and me talking the way i do is just sort oif a recognition that it happens wether i want it to or not. Generally speaking i tell people that they're going to dislike me until the moment they really like me - im just sorta like that. All i'm trying to do is increase quality and value.

Forwarded from ErgoBridgeBot: <Cheese Enthusiast> Hey guys, today I took some time to write about the general offchain transaction framework I designed for SubPooling. Though it was designed with our specific dApp in mind, it may have uses for anyone dealing with large sets of related txs, and so I have described it in a very abstract way. The goal is to maximize scalability and throughput using chained transactions, while also ensuring failed transactions are localized when possible. Write-up is here if anyone is interested:

 Yeah, all in scala though but can see what concepts we can use


[04/23/2022 4:25 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Our implementation is in scala but the general idea can be applied and implemented in any language. Some of the important parts I didnt go into as much include pre-calculating the ERG and tokens needed in the beginning, along with using the boxes from the initial stage as fuel for any other transaction in the group. 

Another important part is ensuring transaction cost is minimized, but this is partly based on contract design. We ensure this by only assigning 10 miners to a subpool, which lowers the amount of iterations performed.


[04/23/2022 4:28 PM] Luivatra#0000
We are handing staking rewards to 2000+ boxes everyday so we both batch together and chain


[04/23/2022 4:33 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Cool, batching and chaining with some extra rules is pretty much the gist of what I wrote imo. Do some of your guys transactions ever unexpectedly fail / not go through?

 y is a vowel in context, it's not always a vowel ... w is never a vowel

I remember watching that with cockney slang subtitles (which only had subtitles for Pitt's character), and then an  extra was some basic cockney linguistics.  But what the f*ck do I know about pikey slang anyway?


[04/26/2022 8:41 AM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
I actually love this conversation.
Just to add to the insanity, in Italian "j" is a vowel. It used to be a variant of the letter "i" and imediately followed it in dictionaries. Then we started important English words so it's still in the dictionary, but following the English alphabetical ordern.

Its about telling a west cork farmer he must get a dog license. The man is irate and claims that he has no dogs, then one barks in the background. Hilarious!

There is an analogous US gypsy language, "Carny Talk", I think also called Ciazam.  It's mostly to obscure the conversation so that it's private as I understand.  I've only heard it a couple times, it's very unique...sounds a bit like gibberish imho.

ABSTRACT


[05/12/2022 11:30 AM] mijbil#7005
In relation to oracle-pools: Random number generation would be super useful for a range of DeFi dapps. What would the usefulness of an oracle-based random-number generator be? From a quick google it seems like geiger-counters can record the random decay of material which forms a gaussian distribution. Statistics can the transform the gaussian distribution into a uniform distribution between any set value like 0 - 10 or 1 - 100 etc.. I can imagine the night-owl casino could use this somehow. I was also wondering if weather data (which is more accessible than geiger-counters) could be used in a similar manner.

it makes the market


[05/14/2022 7:19 PM] TheSentientNFT#0744
but this improvement would be a normal distribution of liquidity around the geometric mean of the assets price derived from the mean of several oracle prices


[05/14/2022 7:52 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Is this a particularly complex set of computations to do? Its certainly possible to do in ErgoScript, but I would ask yourself how you can offload such computation into off chain code. Try to design the contracts in such a way that the bulk of the computation is done off-chain, and verification that the computations were done correctly is handled on-chain.


[05/14/2022 7:56 PM] TheSentientNFT#0744
I mean looking at the uni V3 contract the logic wouldnt be any more computationally intensive than what they are doing


[05/14/2022 7:56 PM] TheSentientNFT#0744
1) Oracle price aggregator contract


[05/14/2022 7:56 PM] TheSentientNFT#0744

2) LP Factory Contract


[05/14/2022 7:57 PM] TheSentientNFT#0744
takes in oracle price data and shifts the probably distribution fuction accordingly


[05/14/2022 7:58 PM] TheSentientNFT#0744
3) Uni Price Oracle at the start of each block contract


[05/14/2022 7:58 PM] TheSentientNFT#0744
This simplifies the computations since time is weird on the blockchain wed drop the integrals and just use summations of each block

but we wouldnt need to use the integral cause wed quantize the curve like in uniV3


[05/14/2022 8:02 PM] TheSentientNFT#0744
into bips (0.01%) ticks


[05/14/2022 8:03 PM] TheSentientNFT#0744
it might actually be more simple now that im thinking/typing it


[05/14/2022 8:04 PM] TheSentientNFT#0744
so expanding on the V3 whitepaper when you pass outside a tick you dont get any LP rewards. The AMM could use this to recenter the price LP distribution


[05/14/2022 8:05 PM] TheSentientNFT#0744
Users provide token pairs


[05/14/2022 8:05 PM] TheSentientNFT#0744
AMM does what its supposed to


[05/14/2022 8:05 PM] TheSentientNFT#0744
makes the market


[05/14/2022 8:05 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Think the integral would be the hardest part of that, so if you can simplify that into summing over some discrete values that would likely be the best way forward

If I understand this correctly, you want to filter out those feeds that are not within the standard deviation of the mean?
If so, filtering oracle-feeds by these standard deviations would require meeting the central limit theorem (CLT). Assuming the feeds will form a normal distribution (seems like a good assumption) then you would need > 30 independent feeds to trust the mean which you would calculate the standard deviations from. If you use standard deviations but the incoming feeds don't match a normal distribution then the mean wouldn't be trusted and your standard deviations might be way out of whack

so it will take in several prices I think 30 is more than enough in your example you then take the mean of those prices and set that as the mean for the Gaussian distribution

this would be done at the begging of each block and checked against the mean value the dex sets (this part is similar to uniswaps own oracle which tracks price at each block)

**Idea: ergo mining pool alliance toolset**

Open source code repo or tutorials on how to spin up your own mining pool which includes node setup, config parameters, basic payout settings, where and how to host, templates, etc. a ‚Äúquick start‚Äù package and up to the owner to customize their offerings.

It is the conscious choice of keeping the blockchain decentralized as much as possible for the long term even if they forgo profits. Also removes periodic reminders of ‚Äúspread out your hashrate‚Äù

Idea: Lucid Charts for Ergo Smart Contracts 

An easy way to build smart contracts with visual diagrams that complies into ErgoScript. This would make it easy for community members to build out smart contracts for whatever needed specification in a no code way.

Trying out the new Discord Forum feature in #incubator-forum  - maybe suited for Incubator ideas? Keeps discussion organised and allows people to upvote.

seems similar to reddit posts

pretty cool

Aggregate information of circulating supply and market cap of all tokens on the network, just like ERC-20 tokens being shown on CMC / CoinGecko


[08/13/2022 4:36 PM] blackinsecure#3693
currently Spectrum displays only Price


[08/13/2022 4:36 PM] blackinsecure#3693
also that info should account for the tokens being delivered via subpool mining

Did not do any research or so , and probably said a milion time but just my 2 cent...might be a good idea to think about a bsc integration via wERG or something similar....would greatly improve chance to be listed on binance ( just look at flux )
