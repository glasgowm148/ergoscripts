It's def worth it...great SW and it's for free...TBH I do not get it. Everything so good cost a small fortune these days:)...Maybe there are some extra paid brush sets somewhere, but usually you can find even this for free. You have to use different ways how to make certain effects than in Photoshop, but still...

Game update: 
We still need to fix few bugs :
-exit button while playing
-ghosts visual behavior after they are killed
-markeplace proper redirect link
-leaderboard bugs

Do you want us to deploy this for testing anyway and fix the bugs on the way ?


[06/25/2022 5:09 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Always think its a good idea to let people test things out and break stuff...

Hi guys
How are you? It's been long time since I check an Ergo NFT


[06/25/2022 5:30 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Hello and welcome back!


[06/25/2022 5:30 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
I'm sure it's grown a lot since you last seen.


[06/25/2022 6:23 PM] ClayTale#0000
Hello üëã Welcome back wish you a happy day


[06/25/2022 7:42 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
All those who have ergo angels listed, the 97 remaining angels are now minted so idk when they‚Äôre doing the snapshot but make sure the angels are in your wallet for that to receive the NETA airdrops


[06/25/2022 7:42 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
I‚Äôve delisted all 5 of my angels but idk when snapshot is coming


[06/25/2022 7:44 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Good call! Don't want to miss those juicy Neta rewards!


[06/25/2022 7:54 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Yeah I wanna sell them but I think I‚Äôll nearly make all my erg back from the airdrops


[06/25/2022 8:13 PM] MoodSoggy#0000
Pfff...lucky guys...I still have some bad dreams about Aneta mint:D...I've tried it like 10 times and...all transactions failed:D.


[06/25/2022 8:13 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
I wasn‚Äôt white listed sadly


[06/25/2022 8:13 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
But on the final 97 Angels there was a public mint and I sniped 2


[06/25/2022 8:14 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Sadly both tier 5


[06/25/2022 8:14 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
But still a decent deal for 22 erg each


[06/25/2022 8:34 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
For sure


[06/25/2022 8:35 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
You have the worst luck with drops and mints, bro

[06/26/2022 2:47 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Ive asked Frosty if wants to airdrop NETA rewards to listers on skyharbor. 
It would be easy to do, just up to them if they think its a good idea.


[06/26/2022 2:47 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
People wouldnt need to delist then, either way Im sure there will be announcement before the snapshot


[06/26/2022 2:54 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
That would be wonderful, but I kinda thought the incentive was for hodlers‚Ä¶ maybe I‚Äôm wrong (and I hope he‚Äôs down üòÇ)


[06/26/2022 2:55 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Yeah it would Be nice if there was an announcement before


[06/26/2022 2:55 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
It could also send the price of angels up too


[06/27/2022 12:03 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
@Krasavice Blasen any update ? Did frosty get back to ya?

Hi guys. two quick news.

The following has been defined:

The collection will have 40 epic units and will be the only ones that will automatically receive the physical units for free (only shipping costs will be charged).


for the other rarities, the requirements for receiving the respective physical arts will still be defined after the epic drop (not free).

I will drop all epics first (1 every 2 days) and the snapshot will be taken after the last epic drop to speed up the shipments.


(This will encourage hold and increase the value of the arts. It will also make it easier to create and ship the physical arts all at once)

the size of the dolls will be the big one (30 CENTIMETERS  2 kilos). Acrylic presentation box will be sold separately and will be optional

Forwarded from Ergo Nation Announcements: ErgoNation Œ£ID verification event #2 is in one week, and the collectible flyer NFTs are already in the Auction House. 

The flyer collection that grows by 10 pieces every event, is used for marketing, and provides a small financial incentive for the event organizers. Mr. Stahlfelge has done the heavy lifting in building the game which will be used in this event. You can support his work by using the products on the tokenjay.app site, to save fees on sigmabank interactions, and to exchange Ergo assets without a middleman.

The proceeds from sales of flyers and royalties from re-sale go to the artist, who designed them. Here is the link for the auctions:

ergnomes is the oldest and most dope collection imo, if you want to buy now you will rebuy from people that mint earlier. you can always wait for the next series

ERGnomes was the 1st fully fledged series on Ergo - each character has their own name, title, and description :)

It was first minted in March 2021, and the ERGnomes devs developed the very first vending machine and mass-minting script on Ergo

Every month a few (3 to 5) 1/1 different ERGnomes are auctioned as part of special events, and every bidder gets a chance to win some rewards (the Ergo Summit Special event just started yesterday, see Twitter / Discord for more info!)

I think that when you sell older #ENFTs, from a time when royalties weren't possible (thanks for making that happen @ErgoAuction!), it's only right to give the artist the royalty they've worked in now
What do *you* think?

As AI proves itself capable of creating great art, interesting conversations are popping up trying to answer the age-old question: "what is art"?
What do *you* think #Ergonauts? Is AI generated art, art? Is it ok if it's just an aid? Should artists be upfront about it?

Vector Minimalism. The first vector on-chain NFTs on ERGO ü•≥

https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/active?type=all&artist=9fve6n3dFYdGsHepEjVWpz8ZS9trWSWmgyHocLwvymwzZeyTxZt&searchValue=Minimalism

All art data are in Ergo blockchain (as on-chain svg), external storage like imgbb/ipfs not used.
I was inspired by the work of artists of the 60s, such as Frank Stella, Ellsworth Kelly and many others.
Compositional conciseness and a simple palette make these works not intrusive, and everyone will find their mood in the bend of the line and the depth of color.
Minimalism allowed me to fit into the 4Kb (ERGO box size) restrictions for on-chain art.

You've probably seen my collection earlier. I painted them to honor Hans Christian Andersen, my favorite childhood author. I know this story is too sad, but I really wanted to practice with colors and make it my own style.

 It seems that you did not notice the word "on-chain" there and do not understand what the point is? üòâ

As for Juan's collection graphiko.net/logos, it is clear that the pictures are drawn in vector. But he minted them in raster format like a jpg, gif or png (old AH minter placed them on imgbb.com), you can check this in ergotokens.org, R9 register (Link to the artwork).

 You tell me üòÖ

If one approach the technical side of the question, here's what can be said about Ergo NFTs. I think almost everyone knows this but still...

For example, let's take your NFT "47394b9319353dee45621c5a8d1ffb00cc21c946913f148df5fa4f721fefa8d0"

Here's how the NFT name/description/URL is stored on each Ergo node, somewhere among the 25GB (https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/charts/blockchain-size) of all blockchain data.

This is the background of the vast majority of NFTs on all blockchains (Ergo, Ada, Ethereum, etc). In other words, only the name, description and link to the image are stored on the blockchain (other technical parameters depending on the blockchain/NFT standard was omitted for brevity).
The picture itself is stored somewhere on a third-party storage (ipfs, imgbb.com, etc).
 
On-chain NFTs do not use third-party storage, their images are stored directly on the blockchain. Here is the fundamental difference with regular NFTs. But there are significant limitations (in any blockchain) for on-chain NFTs. In Ergo, for example, the size cannot exceed 4Kb. It's a challenge for an artist to be able to fit something more or less interesting for a collector into such a small size.

You can also see my conversation with @nitram147, @curbsideprophet and @MGpai in Ergo Discord #development chat.

According to the nomenclature in eip0004's token standard extension, I would like to create a collection of distinct "NFT - picture artwork" tokens that would serve also as "Membership token - threshold signature" and that would be parsed correctly (visually) by wallets and marketplaces. I still don't understand very well concepts like a 'box'. Where can I learn how to handle this stuff from 0? Struggling a bit to find content.

Probably, @MrStahlfelge, anon_real (both not in this chat), and @LuivatraEP have more to share.

 Tokens and NFTs are not smart contract based, no ergoscript needed, just mint and use. It is important to be aware of the wallet minting the nfts as that is used to check authenticity. A standard for collections is being made as others mentioned already.

Hello everyone, I‚Äôm ErBug. Im here to introduce myself and join the ergo nft ecosystem. I‚Äôm a nature and insect enthusiast that enjoys the company of Mother Nature far more than people. Im slowly working on an ErBug nft collection of insects photographed in the wild. It‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea but every photograph is a snapshot of a world that mostly goes unseen by man. I convey the feeling the subject of the photograph imprints on me in that specific moment in every NFT of the collection. Im happy to contribute to the ergo ecosystem.

[09/15/2022 12:02 PM] cometeer#0000
They are interesting, but not as much as Ergo to me. It's the ethos of Ergo that interest me, it's somewhat similar to Cardano.


[09/15/2022 12:02 PM] cometeer#0000
Polkadot is still better than ETH PoS imo.

I'm all about creating energy from other than coal, gas and petrol!
At proxies we have 5 missions (financial sustenability, mental health, tech inovation, art and Environment sustenability)

 Their relaychain/parachain layout is more efficient and seems less centralized than the Beacon chain setup.

"Polkadot uses a Relay Chain to connect different shards (parachains). Each parachain operates independently. However, Polkadot‚Äôs Relay Chain is more flexible than Beacon Chain in the way it accepts shards. Each shard (parachain) makes its own rules (Meta Protocol). The Relay Chain accepts different parachains, which are executed by Relay Chain Validators using standard WebAssembly allowing for higher interoperability than Beacon Chain. External chains connect to Polkadot‚Äôs Ecosystem using bridged chains.

In effect, applications from Ethereum 2.0 can connect to Polkadot‚Äôs Ecosystem, but Polkadot apps cannot connect to Ethereum 2.0. This is because Ethereum 2.0‚Äôs Beacon Chain does not offer bridging for decentralised apps (dApps) developed outside the Ethereum ecosystem, as Polkadot‚Äôs Relay Chain does."

It accepts apps made outside the Polkadot ecosystem by bridging. The fact that apps made in other chains and normal programming languages can connect to it makes it vastly scalable.

Polkadot‚Äôs higher interoperability offers a significant advantage over Ethereum 2.0. It allows developers to use other chains but still connect to Polkadot‚Äôs Ecosystem and enjoy a larger network. Ethereum 2.0 limited interoperability is yet to overcome this scalability issue.

If I've a minted few 1/1 NFT collections on polygon that I've managed to sell due to them having unlockable content (nudes, process videos, alts, psd files, etc..) or people just wanting to speculate with them. Would it be in poor taste to replicate said collections in ergo?

 As an artist myself , I would say yes . 

It would lower the value of the NFT for your patron . 

However, it isn't a problem if you have 2 distinct artworks on 2 different blockchains . 

Also make sure your patrons know before they bid , so  include as much relevant info as possible in the readme . 

Your reputation is what will bring you the moolah and reputation must always be spotless


[09/16/2022 5:02 AM] FiRez#8896
Thanks for the comment, I was thinking it could have been ok since both are different blockchains but i see what you mean. Unfortunately due to art communities general anti crypto stance I've not been able to fully get into NFTs I basically have sold mine without any marketing hoping people find my work by chance on OS


[09/16/2022 5:04 AM] FiRez#8896
I will see if can try to come up with a different collection that's exclusive to Ergo

(re  : *<FiRez> I will see if can try to come up with a different collection that's exclusive to Ergo*) 
 
 This is the way. Ergonauts are very supportive and it's a small community. 

Tag your  work on twitter and also on this group and the discord channel. 

You will definitely get noticed by the right bidders

So @MagicEden finally made the move to 0% royalties.

There is now very little incentive to utilise NFTs as part of your business model. Welcome to the era of parasitic VCs and NFTs as second class citizens. Enjoy.

 It is up to the marketplace to enforce them tho

Somebody doing a p2p swap doesnt have to pay attention to them for example

its in the name, nonfungible with unique id

I think in Ergo case, EIP-004 with Registers R7-R9.


[10/22/2022 8:27 PM] cometeer#0000
Not sure that's is entirely correct, if its a text only NFT


[10/22/2022 8:56 PM] glasgowm#0000
(re @cometeer : *its in the name, nonfungible with unique id*) 
 
 Could also be a singleton, nft usually implies some attached artwork


[10/22/2022 8:57 PM] Gstoiti#0000
(re @cometeer : *its in the name, nonfungible with unique id*) 
 
 Yes. Quantity 1 without decimals, otherwise it is fungible. That's also my opinion.

The survey is motivated by the question how to sort tokens in wallet UI. E.g. there are "NFTs" on Ergo where people minted multiple tokens (one ID with quantity 5 and 1 picture instead of 5 IDs with quantity 1 and the same picture, but numbered in the metadata).


[10/22/2022 8:59 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Technically it's an easy question, but what if the community uses NFT in another way than what it technically means?

(re @glasgowm : *Good old fashion shaming ?*) 
 
 I just discussed with Mr. Stahlfelge that I would like if wallet devs and marketplaces "enforced" the "quantity 1, no decimals" rule for their NFT definitions. He responded that then people start to complain and blame the wallet dev.


[10/22/2022 9:05 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Is it too late to train the community? Is chaos unavoidable? The poll suggests there is still hope üòÅ

According to some scientists, wearing ugly pants could be responsible for the actual market crash.
IF the scientists are not wrong, we all know who is to blame! I'm not telling names here, Mr. Kush...i but I think the Ergo community has to do somethng! Pls. choose 2 save crypto!

 not sure what you mean. you want to mint an NFT paying the fee with a token such as neta or comet instead or erg?

 Where do u mint that doesn‚Äôt ask for direct erg tho? AH asks for erg as payment.


[11/24/2022 7:40 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @dadreboi : *Where do u mint that doesn‚Äôt ask for direct erg tho? AH asks for erg as payment.*) 
 
 oh right  , dapps need to implement babel in their FE


[11/24/2022 7:41 PM] dadreboi#0000
Well. They just need to accept tokens as payment.


[11/24/2022 7:41 PM] dadreboi#0000
Then u pay with tokens and also use babel for tx.


[11/24/2022 7:41 PM] dadreboi#0000
I could be misunderstanding tho?


[11/24/2022 7:42 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @dadreboi : *I could be misunderstanding tho?*) 
 
 in FE they ask for min fee prob , that was 0.001 erg as we knew .


[11/24/2022 7:43 PM] dadreboi#0000
Mgpais python script will make nft with jsut tx fee I think.


[11/24/2022 7:43 PM] dadreboi#0000
Maybe fleet does this too?


[11/24/2022 7:43 PM] koutelier#0000
so now they need to ask for something else. haven't check how a babel fee tx is being build . but i assume pretty similar , instead of asking nano ergs they ask for the equal of nano erg? or maybe they don't ask at all about fees and nautilus is handling it all


[11/24/2022 7:44 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @dadreboi : *Maybe fleet does this too?*) 
 
 fleet is a library that helps you build tx. so i am sure nemo added babel fees tx there. but most dapps don't use fleet


[11/24/2022 7:44 PM] koutelier#0000
we are in the wrong channel chatting though lol


[11/24/2022 7:45 PM] dadreboi#0000

[11/24/2022 7:46 PM] dadreboi#0000
i'm looking at MGPai's git with example nft mint and there is no extra, just the tx from what i can tell https://github.com/mgpai22/ergpy/blob/main/examples/example_5_bulk_mint_with_royalty.py

[11/24/2022 7:46 PM] koutelier#0000
if you build your own tx you can mint an nft with native tokens that have a babel pool

Hi, Ergonauts, SigmaFi needs a nice-looking logo, so I'm offering 50 ERG for the best logo submission. 

  - I like to imagine SigmaFi as a P2P-focused financial services platform on Ergo. So keep this in mind when drawing;
  - The logo must work well on light/dark themes;
  - Accepted file formats: any vector-based format;
  - Submit your work at @sigmafi chat.

I could list probably 10-15 more collections on Skyharbor that are probably dead/rugs. However, everyone's definition of that is different I suppose.


[02/16/2023 9:19 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Ergo is also a bit different in that we have more artists than project founders.

Is it there a dapp in the ergo ecosystem that allows user to mint generative nfts ? Which means, we upload the assets files and generate the images (all combinations of assets files uploaded) directly in the dapp and then select (or unselect) the generated images we do not want to mint and then mint the Nfts ?

Twitter pages that had activity for a while and suddenly stop
They totaled minimum 2k erg on skyharbor and this without counting any AH sale and not counting ‚Äúlegit‚Äù BroonChain art collection.
All are somewhat linked on-chain and on twitter to Bro, (47/59)

I need to hurry up and give away the rest of these porcelain ducks so I can work on my next project. 

I am thinkin all of those who are holders of the duck can be the base of the airdrop for my next project? 

If you wanted one please post your ergo address on the twitter post for me.

Created this "Porcelain Duck" which is an NFT on the ERGO network. I am looking to distribute 200 of these! You can comment below or message me if you are interested, just promise not to drop it! 

Just give me your Ergo address and why you want one!

Got an idea for the ART token


[04/09/2023 2:38 PM] velvia695#0000
Use it as gov token to decide where NFT treasury funds go


[04/09/2023 2:38 PM] velvia695#0000
For example to fund marketing, EIPs or development on ergo


[04/09/2023 2:39 PM] velvia695#0000
NFT treasury = an optional tax/royalty for NFT sales/listings


[04/09/2023 2:40 PM] velvia695#0000
Then that tax gets put into a treasury that is governed by the ART token


[04/09/2023 2:40 PM] velvia695#0000
Not sure how to distribute it though


[04/09/2023 2:41 PM] velvia695#0000
Or maybe the AHT token can be used instead? ü§î

NFT Collection creators, I have questions:

1) Do you follow the NFT Collection Standard EIP 34? https://t.co/Dol1lwrZ4h

2) Do you have an API where an NFT gallery could pull a list of all the tokens in your collections?
