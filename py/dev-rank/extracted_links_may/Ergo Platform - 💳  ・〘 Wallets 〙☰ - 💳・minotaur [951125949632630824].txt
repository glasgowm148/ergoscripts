If you want to use extended public key in nautilus you must convert it from base58 to hex.
Its a great tool for that.
In future releases, hex display of extended public key will be added.


[03/17/2022 1:11 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
That would be great, Android wallet also uses hex
ErgoPay: Does the wallet register for ergopay: uri scheme like Android wallet or does it show qr codes like safew?


[03/17/2022 1:19 PM] vorujack#1729
We used url scheme like ergo wallet app

All versions of minotaur has same functionality.
So this feature also available in desktop version

possible to build the iOS version of minotaur as a safari extension you think?

HI @vorujack when dapp connector becomes integrated can you be sure to include a warning if native assets are going to be burned in the signed transaction? Similar to this: https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/940210065099591741/985302919597408336


[06/14/2022 5:25 PM] vorujack#1729
Hi.
In minotaur-wallet we do this another way.
User can see whole transaction. all inputs and outputs of transaction then sign it.
But it can be done to display burning tokens.


[06/14/2022 5:26 PM] NoahErgo#4349
Great, as long as some warning or visibility is present. But yes I think a warning might also be good if the user does not full understand how to read inputs and outputs


[06/14/2022 5:27 PM] NoahErgo#4349
I accidentally burned large amount of funds and am looking for ways to create safety nets for users in all our community wallets


[06/14/2022 5:28 PM] vorujack#1729
Minotaur DappConnector completed and we are doing final tests.
Due to other active projects, development process of minotaur-wallet is slow.
But I think DappConnector released in about 2 or 3 weeks.


[06/14/2022 5:30 PM] vorujack#1729
It is a great idea to show the burned tokens to the user in a different way


[06/14/2022 5:43 PM] NoahErgo#4349
Great thank you very much!


[06/24/2022 4:35 AM] vorujack#1729
Minotaur wallet 1.0.7 released.
In this release:
* Show updating wallet
* Fix a bug cause lost tracking of all tokens.
After update to this version wallet resynced to blockchain.

Has anyone else have issues with sending to the mintoaur wallet? Sent funds from mobile wallet to desktop minotaur and confirmed on the block explorer but nothing on the wallet

Hi. We have some sync issue on minotaur and it will be fixed soon.


[10/16/2022 4:38 AM] H7#4402
Thank you, in the meantime, can I use the same seed from Minotaur into satergo?

Yes.

[10/16/2022 12:40 PM] H7#4402
And my seed didn't even recover the funds from minotaur lol


[10/16/2022 12:41 PM] H7#4402
@vorujack Are there quite a few issues with this wallet? Concerning as its listed on the ergo discord, website, etc. for people to use


[10/16/2022 12:53 PM] glasgowm#9381
Seed shouldn't be impacted, guessing either your previous tx went through (to a diff wallet?) Or you need to derive additional addresses


[10/16/2022 2:12 PM] vorujack#1729
No. This wallet has a known issue in syncing with blockchain. we working on it and it will be fixed soon.


[10/16/2022 3:50 PM] H7#4402
Not sure how either of these scenarios are even possible. I guess I need to do some additional digging today to figure out what is happening


[10/16/2022 5:02 PM] glasgowm#9381
Well the addresses are derived from the seed which just lets you spend your boxes on the blockchain. Seems the issue is minotaur-mobile syncing, in which case the seed used in minotaur will still work elsewhere and should show your funds. The only reason this wouldn’t happen is if you sent the funds to a derived address as some wallets only generate the first one when you restore (and then you’ll need to generate more manually).


[10/16/2022 5:23 PM] H7#4402
That makes total sense actually, I did send funds to a dervived address on Minotaur.


[10/16/2022 5:25 PM] H7#4402
So based on me doing that, I’m assuming I just need to wait for the syncing issue to be fixed in minotaur

Hi! Trying to send 1 ERG with miltisig 2/2 (the two are on Android). But I "Copy data to clipboard" on first wallet, then on the second wallet I go to "Multi-sig communication page" and click on the "Clipboard" button. Nothing happens, and that's all, I get stuck there... Can I get some help?


[12/02/2022 10:06 AM] vorujack#1729
Hi. Are you see any error on any change in page?
If you click on ClipBoard button it must show you password screen.


[12/02/2022 11:54 AM] DaℵiΣl#1671
No, when I click the button it does nothing.. Stays on the same screen without any error message or anything..


[12/02/2022 12:59 PM] DaℵiΣl#1671
Now I've tried on Linux. The same.. Aftre click on CREATE COMMITMENT nothing happens. No error, nothing.


[12/02/2022 3:54 PM] vorujack#1729
In Linux version please click on view menu ->  Developer option. then send me any error available in Console tab of new window.


[12/07/2022 6:26 PM] DaℵiΣl#1671
Finally I been able to finish the tx. With two Linux wallets. On Android I couldn't do it.


[12/07/2022 6:30 PM] DaℵiΣl#1671
It would be great to add QR for communication between android devices, the clipboard system is complicated. I love the multisig feature, but implemented like this is complicated for daily use.
I'll come back when this feature matures (QR😉).


[12/08/2022 10:44 AM] vorujack#1729
We working on QRCode communication. I hope to release it soon.

I have built it for Macos M1 as suggested in readme. 
npm run build
npm run electron:pack
npm run electron:make
Then found a newly created mintaur-wallet.app in `electron/dist/mac-arm64` directory.
Then created a new wallet got this screen

after reload the wallet have disappeared


[01/28/2023 4:52 AM] vorujack#1729
in `electron/src/setup.ts` comment line 146 `this.MainWindow.setMenu(null);` and build it again
then open `View/Toggle Developer Tools` 
then process setup multisig wallet again 
send me  logs to track problem.


[01/28/2023 7:51 PM] morphic#4133
should I somehow install the app after it is built? And how to run it? How can I check it has a connection to the blockchain?


[01/28/2023 9:48 PM] vorujack#1729
no installation is required. 
to build project only run 
`npm i && npm run sync` in project directory then run
`npm run electron:make` in electron directory
then executable file avalable in `electron/dist` directory.
connection to blockchain does not displayed in UI. you can see requests in Developer Tools window.

[01/29/2023 4:42 AM] vorujack#1729
double check your mnemonic words.


[01/30/2023 9:14 AM] morphic#4133
Does it look up the chain for existence of some boxes?


[01/30/2023 9:16 AM] vorujack#1729
Minotaur scan path from /m/.../1 to find old used addresses


[01/30/2023 9:33 AM] morphic#4133
So I cannot choose the mnemonic myself for a new wallet?


[01/30/2023 9:34 AM] morphic#4133
after applying the fix you suggested, tried to create a new wallet. The same empty screen. Should it work on Mac M1 at all?


[01/30/2023 9:36 AM] morphic#4133
All the steps work ok, but the final operation fails somehow.


[01/30/2023 9:36 AM] morphic#4133
Where can I find the logs?


[01/30/2023 9:37 AM] morphic#4133
The body is like this
<body><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"></div></body>


[01/30/2023 9:38 AM] vorujack#1729
From menubar choose `edit -> Toggle Developer Tools`


[01/30/2023 9:38 AM] morphic#4133
And then?


[01/30/2023 9:40 AM] vorujack#1729
Open Console tab


[01/30/2023 9:40 AM] vorujack#1729
You can view logs in this page.

[01/30/2023 9:44 AM] vorujack#1729
You can create new wallet or enter your own mnemonic to restore a new wallet. Scanning process used to find derived address if exists


[01/30/2023 9:44 AM] vorujack#1729
Do you select Network type?


[01/30/2023 9:44 AM] morphic#4133
yes, mainnet


[01/30/2023 9:46 AM] vorujack#1729
Let me check it. It seems network type not selected to create new wallet.

Please Delete this log.


[01/30/2023 9:48 AM] morphic#4133
Can I create a new wallet with the words I already written out?


[01/30/2023 9:51 AM] vorujack#1729
Yes, you can. But words must be a valid mnemonic phrase


[01/30/2023 10:17 AM] morphic#4133
what you mean "valid"? any words are valid. Mnemonic is just a string.


[01/30/2023 10:30 AM] vorujack#1729
Do you create a mnemonic using 15 random word or create mnemonic using a wallet.


[01/30/2023 10:44 AM] vorujack#1729

It is a browser based version. This version jas a series of limitation such as database size can not exceed 5 MB. Currently you can't run minotaur app multiple time on same system.


[02/27/2023 5:17 AM] vorujack#1729
This is a multi-signature wallet. First, one of the signers must create a transaction and give it to you. Then you pass it to wallet to continue signing process.

Hi. I see your video. There some hints about it.
1- video time is two long
2- you made 2-of-3 signature. So the signing process is done with the participation of two wallets. No need to send data to third wallet.


[03/01/2023 6:52 PM] Rishabh#7490
Yaa i know and i said that to that signing of 2 wallet is sufficient in video btw thanks for the feedback 🙂
