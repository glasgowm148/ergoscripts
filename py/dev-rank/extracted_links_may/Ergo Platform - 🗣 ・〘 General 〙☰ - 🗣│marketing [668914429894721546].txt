To do contracts on the Ergo blockchain, a dev is protecting outputs with scripts in ErgoScript, kinda Solidity of Ergo. ErgoScript compiles down to ErgoTree, kinda typed abstract syntax tree to be stored on the blockchain. #dailyergofact

Signatures in Ergo preserve zero-knowlegde, e.g. from a signature for "pubkey1 or pubkey2" it is not possible to get who actually signed it. This is a real ring signature. ZK is preserved for complex statements like "(pk1 or pk2) and (pk3 or pk4)" as well. #dailyergofact

See how necessary is #schnorr for bitcoin.
In ergo it is built-in, which facilitates lots of applications, e.g. mixing and multisig for free. 
Ergo is not a privacy coin, but it is much cheaper to achieve privacy in ergo rather than most of privacy coins. https://t.co/DTz6Ync...

As the saying goes, like attracts like, therefore our support for sigma-protocols makes it possible so that users can spend using cryptography protocols such as the Diffie-Hellman-Tuple

Oracle Pools - A New Oracle Model
As a part of Emurgo Research, and the new partnership between Emurgo & Ergo Foundation, we have released a new piece called Oracle Pools. This is a brand new model for oracles which utilizes a number of the key benefits of UTXO systems. We will be implementing oracle pools on top of Ergo first, and more details will be released in the coming wee...

or maybe a thread showing the features from other known coins which will be available on erg (UNI/LINK/XRP/DAI/etc)


[01/27/2021 8:29 PM] glasgowm#9381
```The lack of a decentralized infrastructure for the switching of oracles is a challenge for smart contract solutions implemented on Ethereum and other blockchains and similar services. Especially for fast, automated Smart Contracts, it is important to react quickly to problems with an Oracle provider.

Chainlink promises to have solved this problem with a kind of meta-block chain for trading with oracles. However, the essential parts of the project are still in a constant state of development. Whether the system works as hoped, time will tell.

Smart contracts are important, among other things, to enable payments between users of different blockchains. An efficient and reliable market for oracles can increase the permeability and compatibility between the different cryptocurrencies.

I share more intimate thoughts in a monthly newsletter that you can check out here. Please let me know in a comment and join me on various social media platforms:```

The block reward will be therefore 67.5 $ERG (base) + 50.625 $ERG (extra) = 118.125 $ERG (total)

Agreed, Ergo has a solid foundation and once these products start rolling out, I would love to see some high-level / vision / outcome oriented content to help people understand what exactly is being built and why it's important.

I think there are a lot of people out there like me who are interested in Ergo, but have a hard time wrapping our heads around what's being built. A lot of the communications of what's being built are on the what and how level, at the right point in time, I would love to see some why level communication.


[02/14/2021 7:39 PM] Claydo#3635

Some things that come to mind are concise communication around the projects being made, what they might look like once they're finished, how we'll be able to use them and for what. How they all fit together in the larger Ergo ecosystem, then how they might fit into Cardano's ecosystem.

I also really like the idea that Ergo is bringing all the benefits of Proof of Work to Cardano so we'll have the best of both worlds, and what all the implications of that might be.


[02/14/2021 7:49 PM] Claydo#3635
I also think the sooner this kind of communication starts flowing, the more interest will be generated which can fuel development where it counts (the products)

@Dmitry Usov (or anybody else who sees this) I have a question regarding this paragraph on Ergo's website:

"Ergo Foundation is committed to make efforts to maximize the number of valuable ecosystem developments done in an open-source way with least permissive license possible."

do you mean that you're sharing the necessary info only, as in - using the most strict/least liberal license? (asking for translation purposes, to make sure I understand it 100%)

I will try my best: 

"Ergo Foundation is committed to make efforts to maximize the number of valuable ecosystem developments done in an open-source way with least permissive license possible."

We are sharing everything using the most liberal license.


[02/25/2021 7:47 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
@guru_meditation0 This is how I understand


[02/25/2021 7:53 PM] guru_meditation0#6096
@Dmitry Usov that would make sense, but the wording suggests the most strict license


[02/25/2021 7:53 PM] guru_meditation0#6096
which also makes sense üòâ


[02/25/2021 7:54 PM] guru_meditation0#6096
so "we're sharing, but we're trying not to be too liberal so that people do not copy the entire project" or something


[02/25/2021 8:00 PM] Armeanio#0321
Open source knowledge is built with a  collaborative spirit and benefit from new actors building on common foundations. 

With technology, tooling, and code it means take what they have made, try to break it or improve it. Either way is beneficial. 

I imagine in private contractual dealings the ergo foundation is subject to non disclosure agreements, trade secrecy, standard business privacy liabilities. 

So for the practical business function I am sure there are areas they have limited license or ability to disclose information. 

That is how I interpret the statement.


[02/25/2021 8:03 PM] guru_meditation0#6096
thank you, agreed

They really need some marketing strategy for customer acquisition, and what you suggested is a good start


[03/24/2021 9:48 PM] Foeniculum#3278
Also, most people I've spoken with can't see what it is that makes ERG different from most projects. 
Focusing their marketing communications on differentiation would help a ton as well

Very true, but the trouble is you need a easy to access/mainstream exchange

if they even make it


[03/25/2021 8:15 AM] Foeniculum#3278
Agree, even only KuCoin would be a game changer for ERG


[03/25/2021 8:16 AM] Foeniculum#3278
However, building up their social media presence would help a lot with giving ERG credibility, its low mcap might make people skeptical at first but if they found more recent YT videos (about the roadmap, for example), they would feel more comfortable looking into the project


[03/25/2021 8:17 AM] Foeniculum#3278
Personally, I discovered ERG through a trusted person. And so did others on the same discord.
Word of mouth can only do so much, hence the need of more easily accessible and understandable material on socials targeting new potential buyers


[03/25/2021 8:18 AM] Foeniculum#3278
Everyone's slowly running out of cash investing in projects that are getting traction lately like VRA and THETA, the longer ERG waits the lower the number of people with more disposable income left for low caps

fully agree on the marketing, there's plenty of rough edges still there. However, if the DEX comes with ADA-ERG pairs liquidity and price discovery can get a major boost

Not sure if this is the right channel, but this might be someone to reach out to. Popular tech guy/youtuber that's looking into Cardano's upcoming projects. Since Ergo has a lot of interaction with ADA, this might be an opportunity for a partnership.

My goal is to know the cardano space like the back of my hand and get in mega early 

$cards and $c3 are 2 I'm very very hyped about. Spoke with their team extensively and if Cardano pops...these will mega pop.

Not  financial advice.

Have a few more but need to vet them more.

@GMO the two projects he is chilling looks sketchy to me, no info about team, no github. Only buzzwords


[05/04/2021 8:09 AM] Buck#2600
c3 and cards? they're pretty well known in the ada community. For whatever that's worth.


[05/04/2021 8:37 AM] andee#4722
@Buck seems like every critical question anywhere about cardstarter just gets rude answers and responses about missing something big. Their tier's gives me onecoin feelings. Charli3 has a whitepaper that has no actual technical details about how it works, there is a picture with a github logo in there, but there is no github repo to be found anywhere. They have 'Team' on top of their page, but its non existent on their page. Of course I could be wrong about everything but I used the same research efforts and intuition that I have avoided scams with before, so I trust my gut

Hey folks I'm gonna go ahead and ask. How can I get in touch with someone in the Ergo/SigmaUSD marketing team to potentially work on marketing and UI designs? I had pimped up a couple of quick explainer designs now pinned in the SigmaUSD Telegram and got a good response. I'm wondering if I can get some gainful employment working with the team. I'm happy to continue putting out simple designs for the community as I have any way. A shot in the dark, cuz I'm outta work atm, and in the red like everyone else.

hello! it was suggested on telegram that an official Ergo team member reach out to CoinGecko via  hello@coingecko.com, and suggest adding the search tags "stablecoins; oracle; decentralized finance (DeFi)" to Ergo to improve visibility.
Perhaps this is Armeanio's cup of tea?


[06/17/2021 1:54 AM] Howler#1913

I think the same is true of Ergo!  Enabling decentralized mining would have made it a lit harder to ban Bitcoin mining in China. https://twitter.com/D_DellaRocca/status/1408017826456162308?s=19

The excess turbulance caused by #Bitcoin mining centralization through ASICs, makes it clear that decentralized mining through ASIC resistant algorithms like #Vertcoin 's #Verthash algorithm is very important. Let's keep mining where it should have been all along, on people's PCs

I am, it's a very interesting and powerful platform.  I wish I heard of it sooner.   Trying to pick winners amongst a lot of garbage and noise can be difficult.   I hold 2 cryptos VTC and ERG.  I talk about ERG on the VTC Discord as well...

[07/05/2021 8:52 AM] iamlindoro#0491
To save a click, I had some grammar and language feedback-- same would go for both the infographic and web site:


[07/05/2021 8:52 AM] iamlindoro#0491
Cross-chain Exchange: awkward language, missing words. Suggested revision: The eUTXO model enables revolutionary functionality such as shared liquidity across exchanges and ecosystems like the Ergo and Cardano blockchains.

AMM and Orderbook: awkward language and sentence fragments, non-explanatory language. Suggested revision: Classic AMM (Automatic Market Maker) functionality on the Ergo blockchain has already been implemented and tested. Decentralized orderbook functionality, which enables advanced trading features such as limit orders, is coming soon.

Transparent tokenomics: Grammar issues, miscapitalization, needs more descriptive language. Suggested revision: In ErgoDEX, each participant is incentivized to perform their function well. Users benefit from DEX services, liquidity providers receive a share of the protocol fees, and the DEX is funded by fixed transaction fees.


[07/05/2021 8:53 AM] iamlindoro#0491

I am not a moderator for /r/ergonauts, or a moderator in any of the telegram. But I would just like to say that this tactic worked very well for Monero. In every big public even you'll see a Monero flag, in every city there are stickers with the Monero logo on signs and walls. This works, we just need to use it.

If everyone who holds and believes in Ergo should go to all the groups and chat places for ada and promote ergo.
All we need people to buy 50 to 100 bucks worth and erg will be on the map.
Just look at 35b worth of ada out there. We need to have all those people to buy some ergo

I agree, cardano fans should naturally be huge fans of ERG they just need to get informed


[07/22/2021 12:33 AM] hodlingtherapy#5868
The difficulty is the the competition amongst layer 1 blockchains is fierce. It is really hard to differentiate from one another at this point even if you have innovative features. Ergo needs to adopt a broader user base starting by listing in mire popular exchanges. I am sure that time will come. Just gotta be patient.

Had my SPO make a video about ergodex a bit ago so hopefully that helped a bit. 

Might move my ada over to the ERGO pool would move ERG rewards. Pool is already having massive growth

Willing to help anyhow I can. If someone has informative links about ERG ill post them wherever I can.

Hopefully all the EIP 1559 mining refugees flocking to ERGO will be a catalyst for price pump and a decent chance for some marketing to garner more hype for this coin.

We will try to use our internall resources that we have inside to fast track the progress and make it faster.`

A lot more people looking into $ERG, means a lot new questions; one of the questions that comes up regularly is why #ergo gets called the "spiritual successor to Bitcoin". This article can help you understand, new #ergonauts!

tbh I've fallen a bit for ERGO since I started mining. Come next year I will have the ability to travel all across the world, in connection to my other work. If you guys need someone to make video content for ERGO ( dev interviews, content pieces etc. ) I'd like to help

@WSJ New #cardano $ADA holders may want to look into #ergo too. $ERG, is one of the only three cryptos Charles Hoskinson  (founder of Cardano) holds (btc, ada and erg) and in his words:

We were thinking of doing a series of short videos to explain ergo in layman terms to people who are not particularly tech-savvy. So I would do short interviews with devs and people directly involved in ergo to introduce concepts such as nipopows, eUTXO etc. If you are on TG I could invite you to the group?

anyone is free to spin up something like that and run it on ergo though


[08/31/2021 1:55 PM] Kiljoy#3695
I cant believe Ergo hasnt been added to coinbase or binance, its literally all thats holding us back from mass adoption. WHATS IT GUNNA TAKE? If there is a fee involved start a gofundme and let the community pitch in and lets get this done, this is ridiculous. Charles hoskinson has done more for advertising Ergo then anything else out there. Do him and all of us a favor and lets see Ergo get the attention and VOLUMN it deserves on a major exchange. We got screwed with changelly, bitcoin.com and kucoin ü§Æ

Patience young padawan


[08/31/2021 2:22 PM] Kiljoy#3695
We've been patient and have put up with announcements of announcements for months, all to have weak listings. We need to get listed on coinbase sometime this bull run! You guys dont need short videos to explain ergo in layman terms to people who are not particularly tech-savvy, WE NEED BIG EXCHANGES. Its as simple as people are more likely to use something thats easy for them to get. So does anyone know how we make that happen? Thats why i posted this to the Marketing section


[08/31/2021 2:23 PM] Kiljoy#3695
Our volumn compared to ravencoin and multiple limited use case coins is embarassing


[08/31/2021 2:28 PM] Kiljoy#3695
The most attention Ergo has gotten to date is when it was listed on Coinbase under their 'top movers' category for a couple days, thats when ERG hit its highest. The fact that being even mentioned on coinbase did more than being available to trade on kucoin says it all. Wake up and smell the obvious please, you dont have to like coinbase or binance to understand that our chances of mass adoption are slim to none without them


[08/31/2021 2:33 PM] losado#1827
Although I dont agree with your way of delivering the message, I kinda agree with your point to be honest. Having to buy a bag from an exchange that you dont use is such a massive hassle, and would 100% make me consider other cryptos that my exchange supports/lists instead :/


[08/31/2021 2:34 PM] losado#1827
The argument of "oh but binance will have too much control" is not a very digestible concern to be honest... might be a necessary evil kind of scenario


[08/31/2021 2:36 PM] losado#1827
especially while maintaining a 0.5b market cap


[08/31/2021 2:38 PM] Kiljoy#3695
Sorry my tactfulness has faded over the last 8 months but thank you for understanding the message. Not being a fan of binance or coinbase myself i still see the absolute need for them from a marketing and ease of access standpoint. Lets get this done as a community if we can if funding is all thats lacking. We just need some direction and organization. Anyone have this ability on here? Ill be the first to donate to the cause


[08/31/2021 2:46 PM] losado#1827
Thats fair, but team has been working super hard in terms of over all business development. It might not seem like much but getting everything deployed on bitcoin.com and jelly + kucoin in such a short time deserves some serious credit. That shit must be unbelievably difficult to accomplish especially in that time frame. I really think it is one of two scenarios, either some exclusivity contract with kucoin, or some strategic decision to not go with binance. Either way just saying its to not "give up control" is not a respectable response to the community or investors as a whole.


[08/31/2021 2:54 PM] glasgowm#9381
exchange listings take a long time and take a lot of funds. Funds ergo did not have until recently. Bigger exchanges are being approached - but kucoin and smaller exchanges are required to build up so one exchange doesnt have control


[08/31/2021 2:54 PM] Kiljoy#3695
I doubt they would do an exclusive contract with kucoin, thatd be a horrible business move. I know marketing is not on their top list of priorities, as it shouldnt be. The ergo devs are crushing it and shouldnt change their priorities but whoever they have doing their marketing should enlighten us a little of their reasoning and goals or ask the community for help in the form of donations if its needed. The main struggle with Ergo at this point is the lack of volumn, we need mass adoption and we will not be able to get it with the exchanges we currently get. 1 or 2 people could dump their big bags on Kucoin and tank the price or ergo because it doesnt have the volumn of people to eat up whats for sale. Come ONNNNNN lets go, ErgoDex will still not make up for not being on coinbase or binance


[08/31/2021 2:54 PM] glasgowm#9381
erg was already a 'top mover' by the time coinbase listed it so I dont follow that logic (nor did i hear of it happening)


[08/31/2021 2:56 PM] Kiljoy#3695
Coinbase no longer lists coins on their 'top movers' category that they dont personally have available to exchange on their platform. That changed right after Erg was on their top movers list for 2 days, when ERG hits its ATH


[08/31/2021 2:56 PM] losado#1827
I can imagine listings taking 10x as long to list during market bull cycles, I have not thought about that to be honest


[08/31/2021 2:57 PM] glasgowm#9381
ERG hit its all time high due a massive community marketing effort + influencer mentions + and a few successful posts on r/cc and r/cardano (plus topping whattomine). I dont think coinbase's top list had much to do it with it


[08/31/2021 2:57 PM] glasgowm#9381
especially if you're not erc20


[08/31/2021 2:57 PM] Kiljoy#3695
Yeah coinbase listing had lots to do with it, it was that and it was finally the most profitable coin to mine on whattomine


[08/31/2021 2:58 PM] glasgowm#9381
well you're the first to mention it ever afaik. what listing?


[08/31/2021 2:58 PM] losado#1827

[08/31/2021 3:02 PM] Kiljoy#3695
Well im not making it up, Im sure other people saw it and i have a screenshot of it somewhere. Well glad to know its being worked on at least and there are funds available. Please ask the community for donations if you can if youre short of whats needed for a big exchange listing im sure the community would pitch in


[08/31/2021 3:02 PM] glasgowm#9381

Although I do agree we need further listings to facilitate ERG's price discovery/evolution you do realise ERG has made a run from 0.30USD to currently forming a floor around 17USD eh? We cannot complain in terms of price action, especially given the current state of DeFi competitors.


[08/31/2021 3:24 PM] Platypus#2410

[08/31/2021 3:26 PM] Platypus#2410
The most difficult part was getting somewhat traction with the fair launch. Luckily, Reddit and Twitter have more than kickstarted, fire is difficult to extinguish now.


[08/31/2021 3:27 PM] Platypus#2410
And now it brings a model to the table which is very unique in the current VC backed field. Could very well attract purists/old school crypto guys/pure devs because of ERG manifesto and mindset (COMBINED WITH THE INSANE TECHNICAL STACK!!)


[08/31/2021 3:28 PM] Platypus#2410

Has nothing to do with price, even tho it‚Äôs still amazingly low mc. I want to see mass adoption, and my friends to take me seriously and not lose interest or be off put by having to use a new exchange to get it

[08/31/2021 6:29 PM] Terremot#4855
Be patient and keep on with it. If it pumps too quickly it will dump again. It will be an earner in the longer term. Its not a 6 month project


[08/31/2021 6:35 PM] glasgowm#9381
It will come, Ergo has grown a lot in the past 6 months. Expansion plans are starting to take shape.


[08/31/2021 6:42 PM] Kiljoy#3695
Oh i am definitely looking for block rewards to have the first cut. I love the block reduction schedule for ergo mining i think itll do very well. I get this isnt a quick mass adoption thing thats not what im asking or what i think the goal should be, and when i say mass adoption i mean in the existing crypto maket not newcomers, i know ergo wont be the bridge that brings people to crypto because it literally cant but to think that people need to be shown in laymen terms how ergo is multifaceted is whats needed most, it isnt. People will investigate first into the projects that they have easy access to. I get there is community support and outreach that drives the marketing because ive been apart of it heavily IMO with the tools i have access to. Its amazing to see and shouldnt stop, we need attention to Ergo as much as possible.... and its hard to argue that a major exchange would bring that attention. Its the boost that ergo will thrive from, its not a shit coin that people will pump and dump in the first 24 hours like every other project that ends up on those exchanges. Devs keep on slaying with the important work and keep in mind that the community is ready to help out if funding is ever whats lacking. We believe in the project or we wouldnt be here and putting all our mining power towards it. Maybe ErgoDex will be a huge help towards bringing attention to Erg at least we have the 12th to look forward to


[08/31/2021 10:14 PM] roku_to_the_moon#8958
I also think that at some point we will need bigger exchanges. I just wrote on the weekly reddit that I am extremely disappointed about the volume of changelly and BTC.com. you do not even feel any difference. Their volume is so low ... And we get daily questions where to buy erg and stuff like that. It's just crazy, that so many people who would want to buy erg just can't. ErgoDex launch would be an ideal time to have erg on kraken or Coinbase. That would help to really get things going. And looking in the future, when eth 2.0 comes we better have a much higher price and stable volume incl. some exchanges to attract those miners. Grassroots is fine, but at some point a community needs security, otherwise people leave projects because they do not think it can deliver longterm.


[08/31/2021 10:54 PM] Terremot#4855
Ergodex is big. It will make ergo much more mainstream. The devs haven't stopped trying to get ergo onto larger trading platforms. Today saw a 52% increase in volume, which is what exchanges like to see. Granted, it isn't a price increase but there will be dips along with price increases.


[08/31/2021 11:01 PM] roku_to_the_moon#8958
Maybe I have wrong data here but CMC shows a decrease of volume of 35%


[08/31/2021 11:03 PM] Terremot#4855
Hmm. Was showing +52% when I was on my pc


[08/31/2021 11:05 PM] roku_to_the_moon#8958
Which site? CMC?


[08/31/2021 11:05 PM] Terremot#4855

[08/31/2021 11:06 PM] Terremot#4855
It does some odd things at times


[08/31/2021 11:06 PM] roku_to_the_moon#8958
Is there a way to track volume over time?


[08/31/2021 11:06 PM] Terremot#4855
Ah. I think that it jus compares to exactly 24h ago


[08/31/2021 11:07 PM] Terremot#4855
So it's a not very reliable bit of info


[08/31/2021 11:07 PM] roku_to_the_moon#8958
Ah okay. Yeah found a way. On CMC you can see historic data


[08/31/2021 11:08 PM] roku_to_the_moon#8958
I think it went up reasonably since beginning of august


[08/31/2021 11:08 PM] Terremot#4855
Makes sense


[08/31/2021 11:08 PM] roku_to_the_moon#8958
From one to about 6 million on average


[08/31/2021 11:08 PM] Terremot#4855
That's a respectable increase


[08/31/2021 11:09 PM] roku_to_the_moon#8958
Yep, can't argue that


[08/31/2021 11:10 PM] Terremot#4855
There will be a bit of a decline as miners move away, but most of them will be mining to sell immediately, which reduces the price


[08/31/2021 11:11 PM] Terremot#4855
So when they move away, there's a chance that the price will improve

The timing is crucial . Release of the token in popular exchanges, coinciding with ada smart contract release , with a strong 1st mover message in DEX (even defi?) marketing should push ERGO


[09/04/2021 3:30 PM] kallu#3508
But there must be a strong reason not releasing in pop exchanges yet (scalability concerns, trying to nail down right time?)

Thank you for replying!

My organization- Finstreet undertakes educational campaigns to improve awareness of your projects to Indian audiences.

We would create educational video and tutorials for Ergo using our various highly successful social media platforms.

We have previously collaborated with AAVE, Huobi, NEM, FTX, Bybit and more. We have been recently listed as Polygon (Matic) official marketing partners.

We have over 4 Million + following collectively on our social platforms.


[09/07/2021 6:48 AM] AggerGakker#4449
@Angira.Finstreet that sounds great. You are free to create content surrounding Ergo as it is a decentralized project. Is there anything specific you need from us?


[09/07/2021 9:07 AM] Angira.Finstreet#5017
It will be a paid collaboration. 

We handle the entire campaign process end to end. In every process, you'll be in loop. When our collaboration begins we will share a content calendar of all the video topics and upload date and time.

Im really interested to see where both $ada and $erg go with the #eutxo model.

May there will be some news at the Cardano summit?

@AggerGakker I would like to propose a give-a-way through the ergodex twitter using sweepwidget or something similar to boost the twitter/reddit community. 

If we can get around 300 ERG donated on the raffle and give 5 to each random winner selected for liking, sharing, joining the community. 

This would be great if we can rush this and give it out on the 12th to celebrate ERGODEX and smart contracts on Cardano

Thought it would be a good way to market... Sundea swap did giveaways and is a new project and has 131k followers in 5 months... compared to 31k Ergo(4yrs) /15k Ergodex (4months)

Hi Doomelf, are you talking about gifting ERG to people as a way for them to get the first ERG?


[09/09/2021 6:18 PM] Doomelf#7740
I want people to follow and build the community. If you follow you get put into a drawing on each platform. Winners would get ERG


[09/09/2021 6:18 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#1687
That's interesting. I don't know if raffle does tiered prizes yet.


[09/09/2021 6:19 PM] Doomelf#7740
Would be nice to give out to about 60 people about 5 ERG each


[09/09/2021 6:19 PM] Doomelf#7740
i think we could get alot more eyes on ERG


[09/09/2021 7:08 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#1687
I trust you find the perfect formula. If they aren't already involved in erg it can be tricky. In the sense that they might do whatever just to get the erg and them buy something else with it and forget all about erg. 
Maybe something that will keep them in before handing out the rewards. In this sense I think Quokka's Ergo meme contest was good. Because he had it go on for a few weeks, then another few weeks to decide the winner etc. So it kept people *in* the community without them even realizing it.


[09/09/2021 7:15 PM] Doomelf#7740
An Ergo meme contest would be awesome too. Do you have a link to that? They should do another one soon, i feel like we lack Ergo memes. 

Dragging it on longer wouldnt be a bad idea to get more people involved


[09/09/2021 7:50 PM] Kiljoy#3695
Lets start a fund for paying whatever fees it takes to get Erg listed on binance and coinbase


[09/09/2021 8:07 PM] Doomelf#7740
Maybe the raffle is the wrong way to go about this, doesnt seem like thats a way to get donations for something rather than just posting an address to send ERG too


[09/09/2021 8:15 PM] Rolf#8961

It won't be out immediately, but it will basically put a stop to the threat of impermanent loss

Hey guys, was thinking about how to promote Ergo a bit more. Since ETH is moving to PoS, couldn't we contact Binance about making an Ergo mining pool? If Ergo would get listed in Binance it would probably be very good promotion! This would also mean that less people will start usining nanopool so we can prevent an actual 51% attack

Hi!

In spare time i run some minor esports tournaments for fun. We always have some kind of prizepool. One time from the developer of the game, other times selffunded. 

I was thinking to use ERG as a potential price for a tournament, which would also be provided by ourselves or mined by our pcs.

This could be some marketing aswell, althouhh ergo is not associated with gaming in any way whatsoever.

I was hoping for some ideas or input into this idea.

I'm kind of freaking out on behalf of SOL investors (not the big ones, that iny tiny common folk percentage like me) and I tweeted this with the thought of giving them an opening to look at something else. This may be off mark, but I think there may be a few SOL investors out there wanting to get out. Unless the piles of money they made makes them not care about decentralization Idk.

This isn't tribalism, or maximalism, or even crypto warmongering. But if I'd invested in $SOL, I would be pretty scared rn. The now beyond evident amount of control given to a select group, and them wielding it, is the biggest red flag. Not FA, but come have a look at $ERG

Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I'm Aparajita from Cryptic Entertainments, a Crypto Edutainment venture. We are currently creating music brand anthems, documentaries, short films & web series for reputed projects like Polygon, IOST, WazirX, etc. & helping them create lifelong art pieces for their respective communities.

On similar lines, I would like to create a brand anthem for Ergo Platform. 

It would be great if you can provide me with the contact of the concerned person. 

Thank you

[10/11/2021 1:51 AM] ! Raul#4559
Hey , I've noticed we're trying to market Ergo as a Bitcoin replacement , and as much as the devs think it is , we can't fight them , lets try to market it as something that can make the idea of bitcoin improve itself instead of being like , yeah we are going to replace it , its like if we are on a highschool football team and we are really good but we are saying , yeah we are gonna win the superball , and it might become true in 10 years where all of our players are on the NFL and we have the infrastructure to be able to fight it , for now lets market ourselves as the highschool team who is going to win our national league before we try to fight the big boys

[10/11/2021 8:07 AM] glasgowm#9381
what makes you think we're being marketed as a bitcoin replacement?

Erg advanced on bitcoin's tech - but is built to be interoperable and can start doing trustless Schnorr Swaps with BTC after it's Taproot fork


[10/11/2021 12:00 PM] ! Raul#4559
doesnt matter that charles said cuz we are putting it there so it counts as us marketing it like it , and this is the first of many , like i didnt do much digging to find it

with these type of articles you're just saying , Bitcoin is the old thing , we are here to take over , basically what I explained earlier


[10/11/2021 12:08 PM] glasgowm#9381
Those articles are explaining the improvements made on Bitcoins original design.


[10/11/2021 12:09 PM] ! Raul#4559
Yeah but we are getting the most important thing wich is the title wrong


[10/11/2021 12:11 PM] glasgowm#9381
What title would you suggest?


[10/11/2021 12:50 PM] ! Raul#4559
Ergo UTXO Model 
Bitcoin as a foundation for Ergo


[10/11/2021 12:51 PM] ! Raul#4559
Basically ur saying the same thing just picturing to a more friendly stand point with bitcoin , instead of being like this or that


[10/11/2021 12:52 PM] ! Raul#4559
@glasgowm


[10/11/2021 12:59 PM] glasgowm#9381
Fair enough, the foundation one works better. I did raise this when the article was written and downgraded it from 'Improving' to 'Advancing' iirc. UTXO one kinda needs a bit more context for most people but I think people are a wee bit hypersensitive about the btc thing and it stifles discussion. ERG aims to be interoperable with BTC and the Taproot HF will make that possible.


[10/11/2021 1:18 PM] ! Raul#4559
I know what Ergo is trying to do , I'm not saying thats the problem , I'm saying we are picturing it horribly wrong , It's not the first time I introduce someone to Ergo and as soon as they read anything that hints what I have explained they are lost , they dont like the project , and it's simple , id say a big part of crypto people are btc maxis so we need to aim to make the project likeable for those people too


[10/11/2021 1:18 PM] ! Raul#4559
its not like we need to change a whole lot


[10/11/2021 1:19 PM] ! Raul#4559

For me, the fair distribution of Ergo is extremely important when I think about its global (political) adoption. Also that Alex is not a social media guy who has a public opinion on everything is a benefit for this. VC funds and a popular front man like Charles Hoskinson are good for marketing and accelerating projects and applications, but I can't imagine that any western government will accept a currency of which 10%+ are held by insiders or that someone wants to base serious economy or parts of it on a chain which is represented by a man that regularly rants about different things on twitter or youtube.
The second thing which makes Ergo special is that I fully trust Alex to work on it during the next bear market (if there is one). Regarding some other popular chains I am highly sceptical about that work will continue during a bear market, especially if it is funded by VC money. (re @nirvanush: I mean i do care that the coin is well distributed and not manipulated by VC‚Äôs. But i also don‚Äôt mind that dev get their reward for for the work they do and the innovation..)

I think, usually the BTC are locked in some contract and can only be redeemed by the owner of wBTC. So you could always redeem for real BTC and sell that. So the minimum value of one wBTC should be the price of BTC less fees for unwrapping. (re @nirvanush: Really curious about this project.

Also central banks love to print money, they use it as an economical tool to stimulate consumption, so I don‚Äôt see they will shoot themselves in a leg with fixed supply coin. 
The only exception is Bitcoin, and not because some ideals, but because Bitcoin owners has a huge political lobby now, they can actually buy politicians.

**Frostyausty:** 
Yes, AnetaBTC represents the actual Bitcoin, so the value of anetaBTC is tied to the real world price of Bitcoin. It may be slightly slightly different because of premiums and associated bridge fees. But the users Bitcoin is locked on the Bitcoin protocol and anetaBTC is a representative version of the actual bitcoins value (re @nirvanush: Really curious about this project.

**Gstoiti:** 
Sure, there is a long long way for Ergo to become political relevant in some sense and we don't know if it will happen anytime, but it would not necessarily mean that Erg is the only accepted coin. So it could be fiat money + gonvernment coin + other coins and to get there I think the chances for those VC coins are really really low (even compared to Ergo), because of counterparty risks.

UTXO based digital gold with limited supply and most fair tokenomics like $BTC as well as highly programmable like $ETH but at the same time extremely secure due to its outstanding smart contract language #ErgoScript

Crypto was supposed to bank the poor, the oppressed and the unbanked.

We will not get there by charging a monthly salary for each transaction.

Let's not become the banks we revolted against.

At a point Charles realizes that ergo is a very direct competitor and if he mentions it too much before cardano is really up and running.. thats a bit dangerous for his business.
Just looking at aspects like pos vs pow regulation risk, nipopows likely coming from ergo to Cardano. The main plus factors of Cardano are the business teams , the community following and huge funds in the treasury. (re @nirvanush: No love this times from Charles üòïüòÖ

[11/24/2021 11:30 AM] BridgeBot#9505
**fruittree:** 
In the not so distant future (2023?) when it is mostly cross chain based, but until that really happens and the projects with more use case and value are the focus. I think this will happen because of the actual protocol level choices based on numbers n data when defi/ crypto automation is more common.
So i imagine a little while after cross chain and quality defi are everywhere the market rankings will settle in more steady positions, and hopefully reorganize more focused on use case values. (re @Gazza_ERG: I don't think we are a direct competitor, we are both in the UTXO alliance, we all realize the need to collaborate to increase research into the new tech!)

I don‚Äôt think you can really compare the quality of community and tools and code between ergo and cardano, it‚Äôs not objectively correct. My main point here is that when cardano was around 40B market cap it didn‚Äôt have no smart contracts, no defi, no NFTs. Ergo has all of it but still x200 less then cardano in market cap those days. So everybody who say ‚Äúwhen we will have that fancy tool or defi on ergo the price will explode‚Äù doesn‚Äôt know wtf he is talking about. Tools and quality of code doesn‚Äôt directly translate to the price and market cap. ‚ÄúBuild it and they will come‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work in software market.

You have to come out and sell your shit to people, they‚Äôll not come by themselves.)

Can I wireframe a mock up of the erg homepage with some examples of new copy?


[11/24/2021 9:27 PM] BridgeBot#9505
**louis_berlin_style:** 
I think that feedback can just be put into some user stories. To update the ergo homepage.
1. As a person unclear of ergos functions, I would like an ‚Äòin a nutshell‚Äô description that reflects ergos full scope, so that I can quickly register and understand it better.
2. As a user who is non technical and am not a strong reader I would like to see content more engaging than text.  For example a hero Video of all of ergos features and functions or an elevator pitch, this is so that I don‚Äôt need to read too much in order to understand the ergo platform.
3. As a person who is interested in ergos functionality, and who navigates crypto space by using coin market cap and analysing the home pages of projects, I would like homepage show the features that ergo has. For example this may include dynamic and interactive viewports to sigma verse, Ergo explorer and more, so that the dapps and features of ergo and more quickly noted when I‚Äôm analysing the investment.


[11/24/2021 9:27 PM] BridgeBot#9505

So, I was watching the Lex Fridman podcast and I was thinking, Alex would be down? There is a place on reddit for people to request guests, I think it would be a nice fit, Lex is russian and just love russians, programmers, recently he said he was pretty interested on blockchain oracles and there was also an introduction of Alex from when Charles was on the podcast, but of course, it depends on both Alex and Lex decisions.

I feel that is specific. We have the only non interactive, non custodial, multi asset mixer. and yes, PoW is a very relevant topic. Use the opportunity to attract miners

Day #2
With the rising debate on Indian Gov, banning 'private' cryptos, I again realised the beauty of $ERG, the fact that it offers privacy as a choice and not a compulsion.

That doesn't hinder the smart people with money to accumulate. So hodl you coins or do your best to accumulate (re @nirvanush: Was really surprising to me that fair distribution is the main thing people look at.

[11/25/2021 11:30 PM] BridgeBot#9505
**Armeanio:** 
I get asked that by exchanges periodically since privacy coins can be somewhat of a liability on different jurisdictions. 
I always just say it's the product of having a flexible smart contract language. Ergo supports sigma protocols for their well researched security assumptions.


[11/25/2021 11:34 PM] BridgeBot#9505

Got you, thanks for the explanation! It does looks like ergo tries to emphasize its privacy feature from the content that being published. (re @Armeanio: I get asked that by exchanges periodically since privacy coins can be somewhat of a liability on different jurisdictions.

We support choice, privacy with high assumptions is an option, hopefully in time integrated as a pretty seamless gateway.

I would love to integrated seamlessly in wallets. On the send page users have a box to check (like mxsend) that just adds the mixer fee and uses the mixer as a gateway.

Was thinking about the exact same thing a few days ago - having mixer as an option inside the wallet. 
Ergo‚Äôs own wallet is essential to integrate ergo specific features. It‚Äôs the only way to own your user experience from end to end. Now we kinda depend on yoroi and it slows things down.

@Armeanio  I remember  Kushti mentioning in AMA something about additional nodes to strengthen the network. I would operate a node, but I don‚Äôt know anything about it - I guess that does count for other non tech natives like me as well. So I was wondering if there is a step by step instruction? Like which hardware components do I need, where to get those, which  software/programs do I need and where to get those. Everything to set it up step by step. If not yet, might be an idea for a blog post or something like that. Does that make any sense or is someone with no upfront knowledge absolute lost an too far away even with such instructions.

This is missleading and can fool people. Current inflation of ergo is 35%. Yep it has fixed max suppy but not now. After 6yrs it can become hedge vs fiat inflation but for now fiat devaluate less.

I would say it depends. The fiat inflation countries measure and publish is mostly based on products/energy anyone needs for their daily lifes. If you‚Äòd count in the inflation of assets like properties, shares and so on the real inflation is much much higher. There are no numbers of course but I bet it is equal if not higher than 35% (re @machinatos: )

So @glasgowm, the wording here makes it sound like oracles V2 is ready for broadcasting across chains, and they're tweaking incentives. Is that correct?


[11/29/2021 7:05 PM] BridgeBot#9505
**glasgowm:** 
Forwarded from Armeanio: So the goal is to create flexibility longer term both have API's that can be called by other blockchains, and have an onchain source of truth (Ergo's Datapoint) that can be bridged to multiple networks. 
I think the first thing that makes sense is an enterprise based "trusted" oracle pool that can allow us to play with the parameters, economic incentives for providers etc. 
This will start with a bridge for oracle data to Waves Enterprise. Already in development and testing.

**glasgowm:**

Hey @CuriaCrypto @DanielTetsuyama you guys know how big of a market India can be(now that it is starting to get some regulation). However the catch is we won't be allowed to use private wallets or foreign exchange wallets to store our coins.

It will be a multi blockchain world

Interoperability is going to be the key

Blockchains that can scale rapidly will be able to become the DApp centers of the world. These chains will see maximum value accumulation

Any good argument for #Bitcoin and proof of work is also a good argument for #Ergo proof of work. So if any new POW miners spin up rigs they might want to mine ERG since the hardware is more plentiful and easier to acquire, and the use cases more vast.

This figure shows amount of $ERG available on various CEXs, i.e. liquidity.

TL;DR: liquidity is rising, which historically is correlated with rising price

I managed to convince him to create a twitter and start creating NFT's on the ERGO's chain

I think so ya, havent set it up myself yet but I believe it goes to their Twitter name then creates them an account like here on telegram! (re @AndyLowe: So you can tip anyone, it's that simple?)


[12/16/2021 6:02 PM] BridgeBot#9505

So they will get a private message or something that tells them how to access their new wallet? And they have the options to send funds to a different wallet etc?


[12/16/2021 6:04 PM] BridgeBot#9505
**Gazza_ERG:** 
Yeah it will create a wallet with an autogenerated password and they will be given a seed, wallet address and be asked to change password if it's like telegram

Mh, I just scrolled through every tip in the ErgoTipperBot Twitter profile and nobody before you tipped him before.

I noticed that a lot of the successful other projects that have marketed themselves well, have one main thing that is 'their thing', their USP, like a new type of consensus, high tps, extreme scalability, or whatever it is. So what is that one main thing for ergo?


[12/17/2021 8:32 PM] BridgeBot#9505
**Daniumy:** 
Yep (re @nirvanush: When i think about it again, maybe someone tipped him in the past and it was already created. Doesn‚Äôt necessarily require any action from his side.)

I think flexibility is a big one isn't it? Ergo is built to be easily appendable and buildable to do what you want it to do (re @AndyLowe: Guys, what do you all think is Ergo's unique selling point? What should be the best angle to present ergo to the world?

flexibility isn't a super marketable quality in the current market tho, people want huge scalability and transaction speed. Thats the hype right now. Or metaverse but thats a stupid way to go imo

I think the best advertising is to transition the focus to dapps rather than just the base layer.
Dex/mixer/bridges/stablecoins/oracle pools -defi 
Ergolend/LETS/Raffle- countereconomic tools
Auctionhouse/NFTs/Tipbot- social/cultural tools. 
For miners the potential for another pow smart contract platform post ETH. (re @AndyLowe: Guys, what do you all think is Ergo's unique selling point? What should be the best angle to present ergo to the world?

[12/17/2021 9:53 PM] BridgeBot#9505
**Seedubya:** 
This is my thinking, inadvertently brings awareness to Ergo.
Ergo is its own beast, it is hard to pin point at the base layer as it currently offers or or able to offer many of the features of the many top 100 chains combined.
As kushti said, the king of chains (re @Armeanio: I think the best advertising is to transition the focus to dapps rather than just the base layer.

[12/17/2021 9:54 PM] BridgeBot#9505
**AndyLowe:** 
Yes, this is the problem almost, being able to offer a lot of things that are already offered elsewhere, you are not necessarily offering anyone one thing that is new. Or at least, it's hard to summarize it in an easy to understand way for the masses (re @Seedubya: This is my thinking, inadvertently brings awareness to Ergo.

**AndyLowe:** 
I think it's time for ergo to step out of the shadow of Cardano.. there was definitely a phase where association with Cardano (via nice comments from charles, eUTXO similarities, and ergoDex) was this big selling point. And the latest price surge I personally believe was linked to the flurry of activity towards dexes, people getting confused between ergoDex on cardano and ergo. So.. 
I think we should make a new emphasis on ergo as it's own thing and avoid cardano links


[12/17/2021 9:59 PM] BridgeBot#9505

The two things that Ergo has a natural advantage in is privacy and SPV lite clients.

Sigma protocols, how value is created, the mixer.. privacy has a couple of big benefits relative to cardano specifically.

The mixer is pretty unique in the space, and this can only be done with sigma protocols which are unique to ergo as far as I'm aware.

I think the same. Otherwise it may prevent partnerships with other chains and make ergo a pale satellite of Cardano and never break through the market price trends. Most cardano crowd came to ergo because of dex and oracle deals and run away when they heard it‚Äôs not going to happen. Crypto space is really a blue ocean of possibilities, why limit to Cardano‚Äôs breadcrumbs? (re @AndyLowe: I think it's time for ergo to step out of the shadow of Cardano.. there was definitely a phase where association with Cardano (via nice comments from charles, eUTXO similarities, and ergoDex) was this big selling point.

Something else I've thought about- Cardano also has some significant negative sentiment. I mean there's real prejudice out there, sometimes legitimate hatred it'd seem.

.@ergoplatformorg, like the #ergo ecosystem, has grown exponentially in the 7 months I've been here. It's hard to keep up with the updates, the new #ergonauts  appearing every day, the projects, dApps, grants, development. It's crazy. I feel honestly blessed to be part of this. https://t.co/S8PpdE3MwK

The biggest economic network today is the US with over $22.6T 

The biggest economic networks of tomorrow would be decentralised networks that achieve mass adoption

Mass adoption would be achieved when someone solves the Blockchain Trilemma 

It will be solved ‚úåÔ∏è

I share these tweets to maybe provide some ideas on bringing out the real image and potential of ERG out, (short shilling ideas)
Nischal asks very nice questions when it comes to the future of crypto and blockchain, these questions should be used by erg team to answer and do some free marketing probably : )

We know it, the devs know it, not ordinary people. Nobody's gonna read a blog to know it as well. Need facts like these to be put out on the market more over philosophical and ideological statements for marketing, in a short and precise way.

@mcergs @theaggergakker It will cause liquidity shock, #ERGO wont be so unhealthy profitable as it is now  so miners will be forced to hold until price pump. Also SF comming + ETH PoS = üí•üí•üí•üí•. I can see #ERGO in Top20 EO22 if ETH deploy what they propose.

**ergomergoadargo:** 
For those who don't know, Ergonaut of the Month is a campy community award for which there is no reward other then 1. the glory, 2. the community tips and 3. the certificate minted into an NFT.
It is purposely not given to ergonauts employed by Ergo. It reward community initiatives than end up benefitting the ecosystem.
What I think speaks volumes about our community is the fact that every month choosing one winner is especially difficult. There is an incredibly big number of ergonauts who voluntarily contribute to the space in an impactful way- how varies depending on their skills.

**ergomergoadargo:** 
During the AMAs and ErgoPulse they thoroughly explained the challenges of t1 & t2 listings while also disclosing it was in the works.
As they've explained, it  isn't a matter  of picking up a phone and setting it up. It takes time and a series of conditions that have to be met in order for that not only to happen but for it to end up being good for Ergo.
There is no specific date, if that was what you were asking. (re @Michael: Will ergo launch on a bigger exchange anytime soon?)

What I love about both the $ada and $erg community is that there's a willingness to learn from each other.

In a market increasingly filled with tribalism and maximalism, this is a breath of fresh air.

The Terra blockchain is a proof-of-stake blockchain, powered by the Cosmos SDK (opens new window)and secured by a system of verification called the Tendermint consensus.


[01/05/2022 11:58 AM] BridgeBot#9505

Binance Chain (BNB), Terra (LUNA), Crypto.com Coin (CRO) are built with the SDK

[01/05/2022 12:32 PM] BridgeBot#9505
**rothhamilton:** 
Honestly, I kinda think it is marketing, but what they're trying to portray is that the parachains on Polkadot are the L1 and polkadot is the L0, cause Polkadot itself for example doesn't have smart contracts, cause that is not the goal of the "L0" (re @glasgowm: but it‚Äôs just an interoperable layer 1 is it not + marketing? Calling themselves a layer 0 is confusing as it already means something lol)


[01/05/2022 12:34 PM] BridgeBot#9505

They call the L0 the Relay Chain


[01/05/2022 12:38 PM] BridgeBot#9505

Interesting, didn‚Äôt know DOT was SC-less


[01/05/2022 12:38 PM] BridgeBot#9505

The parachains are the ones with SC

[01/05/2022 12:42 PM] BridgeBot#9505
**rothhamilton:** 
Polkadot is quite complicated, cause, technically Polkadot as a solution has SC, but the thing is, the Relay Chain (L0) doesn't have SC, but the Parachains(L1) have, but as far as I know, the parachains are built using a format built by web3 (that also develops Polkadot)


[01/05/2022 12:43 PM] BridgeBot#9505
**rothhamilton:** 
That being said, I think it works the same with Cosmos, cause I think cosmos itselft also doesn't have SC


[01/05/2022 12:49 PM] BridgeBot#9505
**rothhamilton:** 
I guess the hard thing to portray on this image about Cosmos/Polkadot is that if you say they don't have smart contracts, people will complain that they do have using other chains, but also, if you say they have, people will try to correct you LOL

That is actually something to consider in general. 
BTC maxis have been approaching politicians and journalists by sending them books or printed letters in Finland.
Some of them actually took the time to read and learn.

**nirvanush:** 
You can‚Äôt convert maxi with logic and facts. They are too much invested in it financially and emotionally. The day BTC maxis admit that there is a place for other coins btc will loose the competition and there will be no legitimation to btc to exist.

I agree that there is no way to convert. 
I am talking about offering defi, privacy, and  other services that might interest maxis. 
Jack has taken a stance against web3.0 because of VC crap. Well, Ergo can offer that without the VC crap. 
If a BTC maxi does not want any other services, then there is no hope. However, I know that there are many who would like better privacy for example. (re @nirvanush: You can‚Äôt convert maxi with logic and facts. They are too much invested in it financially and emotionally. The day BTC maxis admit that there is a place for other coins btc will loose the competition and there will be no legitimation to btc to exist.)

Has there been any discussion to expand the marketing team to sub-teams, like a marketing team for each big feature of Ergo like an oracle marketing team?
There's an article on CoinTelegraph "Oracle tokens turn bullish as blockchain projects focus on interoperability" and Ergo isn't even mentioned, but a project ranked in 1000+ is there

I suspect they're pulling from cryptoslate which is a paid directory service. 
Oracles aren't profitable in v1 so not much uses rn. V2 is around the corner - but they're more of a framework developers can use rather than a service ergo is providing with data feeds like other oracle projects.

I believe the mentioned article is getting their sources from Messari and Twitter. And it seems like Messari is getting more popular source for journalists to pull from.
Although oracles aren't profitable, there's the marketing and attention part of it that matters. The same thinking like Ergo's current marketing team: before Ergo can get listed on top tier exchanges we need to get listed on the smaller to increase the volume, and the same can be done through marketing the oracle feature more broadly.
That being said, I believe you already tried to request sites like coingecko to add the oracle tag? Would be great to get that tag soon (re @glasgowm: I suspect they're pulling from cryptoslate which is a paid directory service.

**Ile:** 
I disagree. They serve different purposes. 
Best thing for BTC would be to completely stop development. Just serve that one purpose of not being changeable. Change requires governance, and there is the coding core elite too. Both are vulnerabilities.
Ergo is on a path to fulfill those needs for change. It has the strong spirit of decentralization, which sets it apart from all the Solanas out there. The tech sets it apart from Ravencoins out there.
Ergo will need to adapt to serve the now, and future crypto services in a decentralized way. Bitcoin should not even try. (re @machinatos: There is hope, cover BTC under Ergo tech.)


[01/07/2022 12:06 PM] BridgeBot#9505
**Ile:** 
That does not mean Bitcoin becomes obsolete. No change reduces risks, which is great for storing value.
Of course, some unforseen advances in tech could then put bitcoins in risk, and then the capital would flee. However, human control over the system is riskier.


[01/07/2022 12:29 PM] BridgeBot#9505
**rothhamilton:** 
The store of value narrative is quite problematic I think, for a simple reason... store of value is like a "social construct", a thing only turns into a store of value if enough people believe in it, just like... gold, I'm not saying BTC can't be a store of value, what I'm saying is that isn't as of yet.

[01/07/2022 12:38 PM] BridgeBot#9505
**Ile:** 
Agree 100% on both points.
Lindy effect is important for a store of value. People talk about bitcoin like it has been there forever, and proven its security. In reality just a decade. 
Gold has held its value for thousands of years. As you point out, the value is just a social construct stemming from scarcity. However, it is just a shiny rock, and everyone could stop valuing it tomorrow. (re @rothhamilton: That being said, I don't think any smart contract plataform should use the "store of value" argument, cause, it is contradictory  to DeFi for example)


[01/07/2022 12:40 PM] BridgeBot#9505

That applies to any store of value. Nothing exists free from the human subjectivity in terms of value. Some are just more reliable than others.

[01/07/2022 1:21 PM] BridgeBot#9505
**Ile:** 
Diamonds are actually an interesting case in SOV. As I understand, the scarcity is gone due to synthetic diamonds. Yet, the perception and value are kept up by big players. That probably can't go on for long. 
Making diamonds was probably considered impossible, when they got the SOV status. In a similar way, gold and bitcoin might face some value destroying discoveries in future. Eg. Gold from space or quantum computing. (re @rothhamilton: Well, humans like shiny rocks  üíé)

Be great if it was an official ergo foundation pod, and over time maybe you can have shorter interviews with community members. Something to think about; put ergo on as many platforms as possible

Forwarded from fruittree: It takes a long time to build a blockchain, the software tools to build on the blockchain, the dApps using those tools, and a whole ecosystem of dApps that interoperate. Three years is literally no time in terms of software development on this scale.
Where was Linux after 3 years of development? It was released in September 1991. I started using Slackware in 1999, and I can tell you Ergo's development and user experience is light years of Linux then, after eight years of development.
So, the problem with the Ergo chain is your expectations. It's going to take time. If you're experiencing FOMO, go and find some chain you find promising. You don't have to use Ergo.
But, before you go, let me offer a word of caution. The thing people don't understand about crypto is that software has a lifecycle. When's the last time you used WordStar, WordPerfect, or Applix? How about Netscape or Microsoft Explorer? When's the last time you logged into AOL or Compuserve? Don't you think this pattern is going to repeat in crypto?
Here's a trajectory to think about. In 1995, WordPerfect had 50% market share of the document processing market. Within a decade, it was below 1%. Who's the WordPerfect of crypto?
It goes the other direction too. When WordPerfect was big in the 1990s, everyone thought Apple was dead. It's not dead now.
The more interesting question people should be asking themselves is not which chain is going to moon this bull market, which seems to be the framework you are using. I'm thinking about a different question: which chain is going to be around in ten years? Who's WordPerfect? Who's Apple? Who's Linux? Ergo looks more like Apple and Linux to me. But, maybe it looks like WordPerfect to you. We all can look at the same set of facts and come to very different conclusions.
Speaking of facts, here's a couple to think on: When were the following released on Ergo?
The SDK for Java <clipped message>

#Ergonauts - Is there anyone out there working on bringing wrapped $ERG on @SundaeSwap?
I think this would create a looot of awareness to people that do not know #ERG yet.

Eth 2.0 was an original thing was supposed to be one single event where all the updates would take place at once


[01/16/2022 4:45 PM] rothhamilton#0000
The majority of upgrades of 2.0 are already in place


[01/16/2022 4:46 PM] rothhamilton#0000
Sharing for example is part of the "The Surge", also a part of "2.0" and it is supposed to happen in 2023


[01/16/2022 4:47 PM] rothhamilton#0000
The change to PoS is "The merge", it is only one part of 2.0, not the 2.0 itself


[01/16/2022 4:47 PM] rothhamilton#0000
But people call the change to PoS, or the merge as 2.0, because they have that same idea of 2017 when it was one single thing

Random q: is ergowallet.io a scam site?


[01/16/2022 9:28 PM] glasgowm#0000
The P2P/sigma stuff that makes it 'unstoppable smart money'. Other mixers can go down, ergo can have a trustless one. Alternative economic systems, etc. That and/or multi-stage chain contracts and the key things to try and make digestible. (re @TIMRŒ£G7: Which other unique features are you looking to include?)


[01/16/2022 9:29 PM] glasgowm#0000
No just old community wallet that isn't maintained (re @J: Random q: is ergowallet.io a scam site?)


[01/16/2022 9:29 PM] J#0000
Looks very shady and can scare off new people lol


[01/16/2022 9:30 PM] glasgowm#0000
Or alternatively first principles. But something that makes it not generic. Shouldn't be able to put it on another blockchain site (re @glasgowm: The P2P/sigma stuff that makes it 'unstoppable smart money'. Other mixers can go down, ergo can have...)


[01/16/2022 9:31 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
It will be hard to cram all that into a single sentence. I suggest using a second one that focuses on fairness and privacy. You make a good point about this not being able to go on another site... (re @glasgowm: The P2P/sigma stuff that makes it 'unstoppable smart money'. Other mixers can go down, ergo can have...)


[01/16/2022 9:31 PM] J#0000
@glasgowm Ithink those things that you mentioned just now can be hard to capture in those 1-2 sentence subtitles.


[01/16/2022 9:31 PM] J#0000
I think instead of unstoppable, how about reliable?


[01/16/2022 9:32 PM] J#0000

I would‚Ä¶ get a sense of‚Ä¶ tackiness or corniness I guess. To me these words need to be carefully chosen, and the design of the website is also a big part of that. It‚Äôs the same thing as the vibe/design of an office/restaurant‚Ä¶ first impressions and all of that. If I see one a tacky fake fish decoration in a supposedly high end sushi place, I would question if it was actually high end or whether it was good (re @glasgowm: Yeh but would you be curious what it meant)

It is possible (re @glasgowm: I can ask the dev but should be possible yeh)


[01/16/2022 10:46 PM] rothhamilton#0000
And it is one of the most fucking annoying things in the history of websites lol


[01/16/2022 10:46 PM] rothhamilton#0000
Cause usually what happens with this is that, even if I try to reach the ".com" it redirects me to my regional version


[01/16/2022 10:47 PM] rothhamilton#0000
So usually, the preferable thing to do is to have the option to change languages on the header or footer


[01/16/2022 10:47 PM] rothhamilton#0000
Instead of automatically changing it based on location


[01/16/2022 10:49 PM] Daniumy#0000
Im pretty sure for 99% of the people, if the website is in their regional version, they would rather read that (re @rothhamilton: Cause usually what happens with this is that, even if I try to reach the ".com" it redirects me to m...)


[01/16/2022 10:49 PM] Daniumy#0000
Unless you are visiting other country


[01/16/2022 10:49 PM] Daniumy#0000
Or like this case, the website in spanish may not be as full of blog posts as the english one


[01/16/2022 10:49 PM] rothhamilton#0000
Can't talk about everyone, I'm computer engineer and in my field people are used to use everything in english, so I'm biased towards that lol


[01/16/2022 10:50 PM] rothhamilton#0000
Also, one thing that I noticed is that people don't like flags when selecting languages, some people get sensitive lol


[01/16/2022 10:51 PM] Daniumy#0000
I am also studying that but it has nothing to do with the language you would rather read a blog post regarding politics


[01/16/2022 10:51 PM] rothhamilton#0000
But that is a lot regarding technology (re @Daniumy: I am also studying that but it has nothing to do with the language you would rather read a blog post...)


[01/16/2022 10:55 PM] rothhamilton#0000
I think the middle ground is some kind of warning like "We see that you're visiting from X region, would you like to change to Y language version?" written on Y language and one option saying "Continue in english" (re @Daniumy: I am also studying that but it has nothing to do with the language you would rather read a blog post...)


[01/16/2022 10:55 PM] rothhamilton#0000
Instead of forcing it, as some websites do


[01/16/2022 10:56 PM] Daniumy#0000
What I said here (re @Daniumy: or maybe showing a prompt under the "ENG": "there is also an spanish version available!")


[01/16/2022 10:57 PM] rothhamilton#0000
Oh, I didn't see that


[01/16/2022 10:58 PM] Daniumy#0000
But most people would rather have it forced than having to select it (outside technology related websites) (re @rothhamilton: Instead of forcing it, as some websites do)


[01/16/2022 10:59 PM] rothhamilton#0000
Well, I think "choice" is always better than "force" in these cases haha


[01/16/2022 11:01 PM] Daniumy#0000
If with "these" cases you mean tech/programming/crypto stuff yes


[01/16/2022 11:02 PM] rothhamilton#0000
I don't think you understand what I mean by forced, there are websites out there, that just won't allow me to change the language and it will ALWAYS redirect me to the regional version unless I use a VPN or something


[01/16/2022 11:02 PM] rothhamilton#0000
That is the thing I'm against


[01/16/2022 11:05 PM] Daniumy#0000
Oh, I thought that you meant that it automatically set you to your regional language, but not that you could not change it lol


[01/16/2022 11:05 PM] Daniumy#0000

Giveaway ended with 200+ RTs and 150+ followers, and the tweet had 12.000 impressions.
A little bit less than expected, I found it hard to break the breach that separates the Ergo community and the rest of spanish communities.
However it is still a step forward, more engagement.
Thanks to those that contributed to the 20 Ergs, Jennie, LadoPixel, a spanish guy that is not here, and an anon user that donated ~15 Ergs to the raffle.
The other 5 ergs were mine.

[01/20/2022 11:26 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
We had close to 50 bots joining a few times a day and sending DM'S to everyone, it was painful to stop it, the new solution has been promising though! (re @OlNick: I got in now mate so no worries , thanks)


[01/20/2022 12:05 PM] OlNick#0000
That's a big pain, quite a few verification bots out there, do you think those are less effective? I'm looking to run one in a channel I'm going to admin , so any pointers would be great. My son (pretty big gamer) suggested YAGPDB.xyz and carl-bot as the best he's seen


[01/20/2022 2:07 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
All have failed miserably apart from the current one, Wick! (re @OlNick: That's a big pain, quite a few verification bots out there, do you think those are less effective? I...)

The top one, captcha bot was useless, didn't stop a lot of them


[01/20/2022 2:07 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
I use wick for verification and carl-bot for auto moderation

We need "Yoroi Dapp Connector" Extension to get removed from Browsers. To this day users are not aware that it is obsolete and causing bugs.

maybe they could push an update the just removes functionality altogether for the extension


[01/23/2022 9:50 PM] c8e4d2a#0000
i was assuming there is a centralized way of getting it deleted for all users. that happens when extension is reported. (re @Gazza_ERG: If it's removed from the store can you force a mass uninstall for people? Or will it have to be done...)


[01/23/2022 9:50 PM] c8e4d2a#0000

[01/24/2022 12:23 AM] AndyLowe#0000
couple of points that I feel might be worth adding.. (re @TIMRŒ£G7: Yes sir)


[01/24/2022 12:23 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
go ahead


[01/24/2022 12:29 AM] AndyLowe#0000
firstly, ergo having the ability to amend itself should be seen as a strength, you mentioned that btc is unamendable. but that amendability is part of ergos intentional design to make it future proof. that also ties in to my second point which is about the smart contracts and dapps running on ergo. the long term prospect for a PoW chain that doesnt have any transaction volume is pretty... unclear shall we say... since all those million people securing bitcoin are only there for the emission, which will end. And even before it ends, it will halve itself to be so small that many miners are no longer profitable. With ergo, if there are enough good applications and people using the network, in theory that shouldnt be a problem. So the amendability of the tx fees, and storage rent etc, is all part of the survivabiity, to be able to tweak incentives. Also, storage rent, did you mention it?
finally, there are some interesting additional things that armeanio has been talking about recently, to do with as PoW governance, the framework that getblok are creating that allows miners to vote with their hashpower, can be expanded into other forms of governance, and could even be used as a sort of initial token offering to launch new projects (get paid in new tokens for your hashpower). So there are interesting things that can be done in the future on ergo that only adds to the decentralisation.
your article is great btw, very well written


[01/24/2022 12:30 AM] AndyLowe#0000
üëÜforgot to reply (re @TIMRŒ£G7: go ahead)


[01/24/2022 12:33 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
yes, all good points! I was trying to balance length and what I think a BTC loving audience would like to hear, and I wonder how well received ammendability and storage rent would be. The pow governance is fantastic, and just came out after I had already written it, or else I would likely include it. (re @AndyLowe: firstly, ergo having the ability to amend itself should be seen as a strength, you mentioned that bt...)


[01/24/2022 12:34 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
The views have seriously begun to taper, so I'm thinking the best thing to do would be to just write another article focusing on the ammendability of Ergo. This would have a different intended audience and i could include all of those things, as well as the details of how the soft fork is happening


[01/24/2022 12:34 AM] AndyLowe#0000
I think we need to own the amendability. its a clear design choice that argues that it is the best way to go. you just have to make the case for it (re @TIMRŒ£G7: yes, all good points! I was trying to balance length and what I think a BTC loving audience would li...)


[01/24/2022 12:35 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000

[01/24/2022 12:36 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I agree that ammendability is what makes ergo sustainable long term


[01/24/2022 12:36 AM] AndyLowe#0000
its all part of the debate about the long term viability, which is a serious topic for bitcoin maxis as well. so it should be interesting. also the argument that transaction fees alone are not enough to support bitcoins security model.. its a pretty essential conversation to have (re @TIMRŒ£G7: The views have seriously begun to taper, so I'm thinking the best thing to do would be to just write...)


[01/24/2022 12:37 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Also, thank you for the feedback. I gave this to a ton of people and only got a couple of suggestions back. I'll ping you for edits if I get around to writing a second one


[01/24/2022 12:37 AM] AndyLowe#0000
extending the emission without modifying the original design of ergo from the whitepaper, its only possible due to storage rent, so storage rent has multiple benefits


[01/24/2022 12:37 AM] AndyLowe#0000
another one is, if the foundation suddenly ceased to exist (they all die lets say, or, never spend any money again) all those funds end up with miners eventually


[01/24/2022 12:39 AM] AndyLowe#0000

Forwarded from lifeofifa: Guys I am so exited to share this with you! One of the biggest things everyone is always going on about is hype and marketing when it comes to crypto and Ergo in particular.¬†
Now I know we have a solid project going here and it's success doesn't rely on marketing and me, but I do feel that leading more people to Ergo in 2022 and giving it the shine it deserves is the way to go and this is the way I can contribute. 
So, for the last two months I have been conceptualising and working my butt off to bring something awesome to the table with my skillset and ability as I won't do much good trying to join the dev team...¬†In a couple of days time I will be launching the first of a series of creative films on Ergo. 
Part 01 is titled CREATION and it resembles the birth of Ergo. From it's birth you will have to wait and see where the road leads next (Part 02)... With the release of each film I will be dropping some additional goodies not to be missed and will share more with you guys on this shortly!

hey everyone, we just got our first Ergo pool up, would love some help testing and any feedback on the site design


[02/04/2022 5:12 PM] arcadiancomp#0000
Our idea is to launch as a 0% Fee / PROP payout pool, until we get people mining with us, then switch to 1% to cover costs as we grow, but if people stake ADA with our RKDN stake pool, we'll let them stay at 0% fee even after we switch.

[02/10/2022 2:54 PM] Chrostpher#8935
I hear a lot of people in the cypto space show concern about energy demands of PoW.  Understanding there will be some who have their minds made up about environmental impacts, I feel there is room for improvement in this area.  Among miners, we often joke about our rigs being space heaters in the colder regions.  I have also read articles of home mining farms being used to convert the heat into other uses around the home.  Perhaps some more ideas can be brought to the table on how PoW can be used with more intent to offset the energy use into something more productive than simply mining for profit.


[02/10/2022 4:34 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
This is a very interesting thought.  We are exploring clean initiatives at GetBlok.io for mining with various other sources other than fossil fuels.  We started a poll on this yesterday. https://twitter.com/getblok_io/status/1491482969810350085?s=21

What are your thoughts on #PoW (Proof-of-Work) mining based on clean energy? 

While considering energy costs, does this interest you as a miner?
Twitter


[02/10/2022 4:38 PM] SoCool#6419
Purely from a marketing standpoint, this is that much more reason to lean into the integration efforts with Cardano and whenever we have them in ErgoDEX being publicly loud about how it allows us to mine and support PoS initiatives; the tree planting project Cardano has for instance.


[02/10/2022 4:40 PM] SoCool#6419
Could think about making a green and non-green pool; green pool maybe have some experimentation around offsetting; perhaps fee goes from 1% to 1.3% with the assurance the .3% piece will be spent on green initiatives (Cardano tree planting, other specified green projects around the world which could be marketed as such etc)


[02/10/2022 5:24 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Interesting you say that.  We are exploring something very similar.  Except remember in the future we plan on supplying subpools.  So in theory we could have a subpool assigned to green mining or various other causes.  A PoW backed fundraising platform.

[02/10/2022 10:06 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
As @√Ör√ñhB√™  mentioned, GetBlok.io has committed to be a fully clean and renewable energy sources for our managed hosting offering currently under design and implementation.  The question I have is how can we be a disruptor to the PoW perspective that it is dirty?  A few ideas come to mind, like what you suggested:

1) How can we incentivize miners to actually make greener choices in their consumption of energy?  As we all know, miners are primarily incentivized by rewards and revenue. Yes, some of us believe that its the right thing to do, but it is an uphill battle when majority of miners do not have the means or access to greener energy sources. 
2) How do we validate that any particular miner is actually making greener choices?  Since PoW is a trustless model, I could say "show me your power bill" but I don't believe its a reasonable request due to certain miners wanting (and rightfully so) to protect their KYC identity.  
3) On the topic above, maybe what you suggested is sufficient for miners to choose GetBlok (Or any other pool) by committing in investing a portion of the mining pool fees to a certified and real-life initiative (e.g. tree planting, etc).  My thoughts is that the mining pool fees are just not enough to cover or make a significant impact on the cause?  
4) The other thought is to have miners elect to donate a portion of their hash rate to community-approved and selected causes (using the POV mechanism).  Miners can then choose a percentage they wish to grant.
5) The last idea is to formulate a variation of PPLNS.  Call it "PPLNS+G" for Green where based on certain criteria (see #2) miners can participate in a selective subpool where they earn extra rewards.  Again issues of #2 comes to mind.  

In any case, let's discuss.

NFT security in Ethereum account model based chains is a shitshow. One approval leaves the door open for any later discovered attack vectors. 
I think eutxo is safer in this regard. With the opensea drama in full swing, this could be used to advertise in social media. 
Is there any technical writeup to explain this? 
Otherwise, here are some threads to praise eutxo/Ergo:

Here's the most correct recap of what's happening with OpenSea right now.

tl;dr The security of web3 platforms depend entirely on wallets with universally poor security UX, and there's very little the platforms can do about it.

Clicking 'mint' on mobile will prompt the ergo wallet app to open! This is huge as it opens the market up to mobile only users. Hopefully other NFT marketplaces intergrate ErgoPay!

In less than 24hrs, #Ergo miners will be guaranteed block rewards until ~2046

A selfless act by #miners forfeiting a % of current block rewards which will be placed in a re-emission contract

This ensures crypto-economic #security of the protocol for years to come

think armeanio or andy were in touch after his last vid but iirc it focused mostly on the website so we were waiting for relaunch


[03/08/2022 10:30 PM] Bobatoshi#0000
Awesome to hear! I watched a couple of his videos after he did the first one on erg, seemed very concise. Great networking! (re @glasgowm: think armeanio or andy were in touch after his last vid but iirc it focused mostly on the website so we were waiting for relaunch)

CMC is crap for a lot of projects not just ours


[03/08/2022 10:32 PM] Bobatoshi#0000
Maybe put a huge button on the site to see erg/coingecko? Only solution I could see is SEO for erg prices


[03/08/2022 10:32 PM] glasgowm#0000
I think its just what he uses for everything - lots of people do.


[03/08/2022 10:37 PM] Bobatoshi#0000
He asked for a live AMA. Wonder if that would be possible with the new roadmap introduced? Honestly so much to cover. I wonder how much preparation he would put in for such an interview


[03/08/2022 10:38 PM] Bobatoshi#0000
He doesn't really cover too many of the key areas surrounding privacy and security in the video.


[03/08/2022 10:39 PM] Bobatoshi#0000
Or even the price point for mass transactions.


[03/08/2022 10:40 PM] Armeanio#0000

It's because were not on binance, if we were on binanace they would probably be like. Oh yes, that will be resolved in 2 hours.


[03/08/2022 10:43 PM] Bobatoshi#0000
I would think they put all of that work as the top priority.


[03/08/2022 10:47 PM] Bobatoshi#0000
On a side note you guys really been doing a great job. Ryan Matta is really digging for an AMA. I would not pass it up considering the outreach. Maybe supplement a weekly AMA for a show with him if it's too much for a week.


[03/08/2022 10:47 PM] Bobatoshi#0000
Can't hurt right?

[03/08/2022 11:02 PM] glasgowm#0000
They‚Äôre at it. Had to fill in all sorts of forms explaining what all the top wallets are - they say it‚Äôll be updated if they agree - otherwise you won‚Äôt hear from them.
But its nonsense as their ‚Äòindependent verification‚Äô doesn‚Äôt even matter as the issue is that they‚Äôre not dynamically updating the supply with mining emission. So I guess their argument is we‚Äôre not PoW and don‚Äôt have miners ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (re @Bobatoshi: It's because were not on binance, if we were on binanace they would probably be like.

Its Been 3 months i m part of the community .. 
I love the community but i think we need to work more and structure better our 
-Content writting
-Graphic Designer
-Marketing 
We know we are in a industry where a constant develpment and posts are what most of public gets attracted to, we are doing great explaining ergo to people with knowledge about how blockchains work, but not really a easy guide For people Who dont know and dont even care to know about blockchains, Who love to see numbers and facts..
I m not in any position of calling For   creating a structure For future ,if ERGO hits back hard like in 2019...
We need to keep people more update, creat more contests,give some to get some ... If u think what i am saying has some l√≥gic to It,please drop a comment below of what can u provide , we creat a diferent Groups and every one tales care of one thing and help ERGO and help ourself ü•∑

There is the ergo explainer series and videos to match in the works + a lot of organisation stuff going on behind the scenes in contributor chats (See pinned message to apply). 
What‚Äôd you have in mind specifically? 
Sure any competition or initiatives you want to run could be easily funded through the raffle.

"The easiest coin to move to outside of ETC after the merge, will be $erg"

I think @SonOfATech makes a good point here. Mining Ergo takes basically the same overclocks and is definitely easier on the cards than most of the other algorithms.

Hey, has Ergo been in talks with different universities? I think since different universities are starting to accept crypto as a means of donation, this can help the project. Just food for thought since my university I currently attend is mining crypto and has taken Ethereum donations in the past.

WHY ERGO ?
Let me give you 3 simple reason For miners
-Less stress on the GPUs
-Less transaction fees
-Profitability  is greater.

not surre what you mean, fee on kraken is generally high, kucoin fee is very low, including trades, atleast for the stuff i withdraw. i dont withraw erc20 that's always high in kucoin.

Kucoin is lowest 0.01ERG


[03/28/2022 9:33 PM] Mx62#7304
i know its nothin crazy, but they also charge a 2% premium on USDT for their onramp, which you need to trade for ERG, then a trading fee, then their withdrawal fees are typically larger than krakens, so im hoping kraken would be a more convenient and cheaper place to get it


[03/28/2022 9:33 PM] Mx62#7304
i know @jespow cares about privacy, custody, and freedom, would be cool if he would list ERG


[03/28/2022 9:33 PM] cardelayno#0000
transfer usdt through TRX from kraken to kucoin, dont want to onramp directly kucoin


[03/28/2022 9:35 PM] cardelayno#0000
there will be usdt on ergodex in the future, through susybridge, if that decides to happen


[03/28/2022 9:36 PM] Mx62#7304
yeahhh i could do that
i also dont like having to dirty my hands with USDT or hold it for more than the 30 seconds i need it
if anything id favor buying BTC and using anetaBTC to onramp

I‚Äôd like to create a few graphics for upcoming AMA‚Äôs. I‚Äôm not too savvy with Discord (forgive me if this isn‚Äôt the best place), but can I share files here? I.e. .ai, PNG, or JPEGs? My next question would be-who‚Äôs editing the video and what programs are they using.

I remember this being an issue for Cardano a year or two ago. Maybe once Ergo grows, they keep it updated.. But in the meantime, it‚Äôs definitely frustrating.

[04/06/2022 4:45 AM] liquid_phase#4605
is this a 3d file or a vector?


[04/06/2022 4:50 AM] Bryce#8378
A vector file within a composition that is stacked multiple times, then the camera is moved around the stacked compositions. I can also use vector outlines and add extrusion depth to the vector outlines... not sure if that answers your question-I'm not sure if I really could, honestly. The files used are .ai for vector image, .aep for movement, and .prproj to add footage behind the image.


[04/06/2022 4:51 AM] liquid_phase#4605
can you link/send me the vector file please

Sigma protocols as a concept is abstract and hard to relate for the avergae joe/joanna. 

The Sigma Protocol is also the title of a book which is ".. the story of the son of a¬†Holocaust¬†survivor who gets entangled in an international conspiracy by industrialists and financiers to take advantage of wartime¬†technology."

I believe that Sigma Protocols might be a bit too militaristic, and hard to adapt into enterprise.

I think instead, for marketing endeavors, we could instead start to call them 'Ergonomics' - which serves to simplify, add sex appeal, show inherent flexibility and still get the point across.


[04/08/2022 4:32 PM] liquid_phase#4605
This also serves if we are looking at the phrases etymologically.
Economics = Habit/environment Law - dictating the rules of engagement and interaction between human and environment.
Ergonomics = Therefore/Work Law - dictating the rules of engagement and interaction between pre-existing and new inter-working systems.


[04/08/2022 4:39 PM] liquid_phase#4605
First man must build systems with and around nature, so economics has dictated the world. Now, man has essentially conquered nature with technology, ERGO, the rules of engagement need to change

i mean, it seems a little harsh to expect a non-native english speaker (and what appears to be some kind of autistic genius) to speak the language eloquently. English is my native language and I butcher it constantly, with likes and uhms.

You might have a false perception that all people with money care about is sleek and sexy marketing. That's what the middle class wants and what's good for mass adoption MAYBE - but really nothing to do with the enterprise or b2b world where a product or person is judged on the merit of the value being provided to a system


[04/08/2022 9:41 PM] fruittree#0000
better than a bunch of robots with no character, although i understand that might negatively impact newcomers also, we can motivate them to take public speaking classes etc, bring in people that have the knowledge and that can fill their public speaking roles, or anything that we can imagine and implement.


[04/08/2022 9:43 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i think armeanio has the best point about this. its not about ERGO necessarily but the devs and what they build. ergo is the platform to build on/in.

Only real estate and construction developers care about the inner workings of buildings - but everyone who has a home lives in one


[04/08/2022 9:44 PM] liquid_phase#4605
The point being that ergo doesnt need to be glammed up - it needs to be robust and available to talented people who can build sexy things that attract the masses


[04/08/2022 9:45 PM] liquid_phase#4605
So i see Ergo the network like concrete


[04/08/2022 9:46 PM] liquid_phase#4605
it is the foundation and makes up the buildings, but what you bring inside and build out from it is all on you - concrete is so good it's been around a millenia and ergo has the same potential


[04/08/2022 9:48 PM] liquid_phase#4605
and like concrete, you'd never really think about it from a sexy or glam level - its a utility and serves a purpose

And speaking from experience, the concrete trade show in las vegas is probably the largest enterprise trade show i've ever seen. But do you stop and ever think to yourself how the sidewalk is different concrete than a building or subway platform? Concrete is not sexy but it makes up the foundation for almost everything around you in modern society

#Ergonauts! I'm in need of a logo for my upcoming YouTube channel. 

Instead of paying a company for logo design, I thought it would be great to open it up to the #Ergo community. 

Something clean and simple with the text "CW"

I've seen lots of confusion recently about how wallets and the Ergo Blockchain work. Your wallet doesn't hold any funds, it is just a door to your address on the Blockchain. Your seed phrase is the key to that door, any Ergo wallet can be used to access your funds with your key!

Ryan Matta is like losing his shit after this Kadena/Kadex situation went viral. 

I honestly feel bad for him. A few of us #Ergonauts should reach out to him, extend an olive branch and invite him to explore Ergo more.

Show him why Ergonauts have the crown for BEST crypto community, hands down.
Then we'll ease into friendly debate over the pros and cons of both Ergo & Kadena.

 I think we did a nice approch to him he did only 2 videos on ergo and since then i didnt see a thing on his channels related to ergo, i dont know if It was generic traffic gained threw his videos o he was taking "advantage of the eth pos and miners getting to ergo" he has audiance, yes. But i think ergo doesnt required a manipulation of that type like flux and kadena were offering maybe... We follow our b√°sic rules and grow slowly,thats my opinion.

 Beyond just assigning roles, I think getting the Erg mining community to be more active on social channels during that time can help a ton. There's a lot of people who can help who aren't active on daily basis.

1/ Over the past several days, market volatility across crypto assets has been significant. 

The market turmoil is also reflected by the past week's uncertain macro conditions across legacy asset classes.

Yesterday showed the strength of sigusd in holding peg. Its 1$, zero volatility.
Today we see the strength of its liquidity. Every other stablecoin will have problems providing liquidity to people mass panic selling. This is because they have collateral in assets that can't be sold immediately.
Sigmausd.io lets you exit sigusd whenever and as much as you like. Even the whole circulating supply. 100% liquid.
(External services will have problems if you want to exit erg after that, but that is out of the protocols scope.)

SigUSD has been running for ages and never lost its peg, even when erg dropped from $17 to $2.10. #Lunacrash  #StableCoin 

They keep saying DJED never lost its peg, but it's never been tested in the wild either.

Recent events once more show that 99.9% of all crypto projects are as bad or even worse than #TradFi.
Primarily crypto should be about values but not those kind measured in APY/ROI- it should be way more about the values why crypto exists in the first place‚Ä¶üßµ

On a slightly more serious note:
This week has been very difficult for many people. I hope everyone is coping ok.
I want so share that it‚Äôs Mental Health Awareness Week runs from Monday 9 - Sunday 15 May 
because of the volatility of the products - I feel that crypto organisations have certain a duty of care to share guidance and facts about supporting mental health while investing in crypto. Everyone has experienced moments being in the space for so long, so it‚Äôs good to talk openly about this and form a healthy community culture around mental health. 
As a suggestion maybe the Ergo can make a few posts over the weekend for mental health awareness week. Perhaps by sharing resources to help people cope who might be facing mental health difficulties during this period.

(re @AndyLowe : *Iv heard he's an actor*) 
 
 I'm sure he was an "actor" but essentially he's the presenter for the channel  he's been doing it for years right


[05/18/2022 10:28 AM] glasgowm#0000
But ERG is easy to shill, and a small-cap. Would be easy views for a big channel not sure why no ones latched on yet.


[05/18/2022 10:30 AM] Sofaclese#0000
I've always found him to br pretty reasonable in comparison to other YouTube shills 
Always seems to attempt to cover the good and bad...just look at his coverage of cardano which he owns 
Never liked any of the shiller youtube bitboy gang if this world
 but always found him to be more rounded in his coverage and way more open about what he does and doesn't own


[05/18/2022 10:30 AM] Sofaclese#0000
(re @glasgowm : *But ERG is easy to shill, and a small-cap. Would be easy views for a big channel not sure why no ones latched on yet.*) 
 
 I agree
He does say he tends to steer clear of coins outside the top 100 as there are so many flash in the pan scams


[05/18/2022 10:30 AM] AndyLowe#0000
He's probably getting paid behind the scenes by Solana VCs. Who knows

(re @Sofaclese : *I agree

[05/18/2022 10:32 AM] Sofaclese#0000
(re @AndyLowe : *He's probably getting paid behind the scenes by Solana VCs. Who knows*) 
 
 I mean
He makes a point of saying he doesn't accept payment from people for coverage 
Not sure if that would put him at risk if it turned out to be the case he had taken money
It's possible of course

But it is relatively less risky

$ERG was notably missing from @coinbureau's latest video on decentralisation.

Why?

- Largest community allocation of any smart-contract platform (95.57%)
- ASIC resistance
- Attempted pool resistance (SCs make them unfeasible)
- Grassroots.

 Agree 
Although in theory if you've been paid I gather legally you are required to disclose that info these days in line with "influencer rules"  on social platforms


[05/18/2022 10:45 AM] Sofaclese#0000
Doesn't stop people slipping some into an anon wallet of course


[05/18/2022 10:46 AM] glasgowm#0000
For print anyway you need to just have ‚Äòadvertorial‚Äô on it and it to be obvious. That‚Äôs either not a requirement for social or nobody adhears to it


[05/18/2022 10:49 AM] Sofaclese#0000
(re @glasgowm : *For print anyway you need to just have ‚Äòadvertorial‚Äô on it and it to be obvious. That‚Äôs either not a requirement for social or nobody adhears to it*) 
 
 You are supposed to disclose it in caption - usually with #AD  or such 
From my work with brands and knowing some celebs/ Influencers they do adhere to through fear/ risk of legal action generally
No idea if that translates to the crypto youtube space so much though 
But could land some of them in hot water eventually if they don't 
Given CBs advertising that they actively refuse to cover projects for payment it would be extra scandalous
Does whole videos disclosing his portfolio....could be a ruse of course


[05/18/2022 10:52 AM] glasgowm#0000
we‚Äôd only have to use that when they paid for the spot actually. If they pay you lots for something else and then you do a double-page spread review, all ok.


[05/18/2022 10:52 AM] glasgowm#0000
for us it was actually legit (big advertiser, also makes good products we review). So I imagine it‚Äôs even more of a grey area on yt

(re @Sofaclese : *What changed?

 If someone says Solana can be the most decentralised crypto then they instantly lose all credibility in my view


[05/18/2022 10:54 AM] AndyLowe#0000
That's either a bag shill or a fundamental lack of understanding


[05/18/2022 10:54 AM] AndyLowe#0000
Either way I'm no longer interested in what they have to say


[05/18/2022 10:55 AM] glasgowm#0000
the tech itself for solana is decentralised - at some point in the future when computers are faster. But yeh no escaping from their tokenomics


[05/18/2022 10:55 AM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
(re @Sofaclese : *Agree

 I think there is always a way around those rules on traditional markets too. It is just less obvious, or stays within the bounds of law. 
When some big VC decides to push Solana, you see it in every media. It might not be influncer fees exchanging hands, but the end result is the same: not objective influencing.


[05/18/2022 11:12 AM] AndyLowe#0000
(re @glasgowm : *the tech itself for solana is decentralised - at some point in the future when computers are faster. But yeh no escaping from their tokenomics*)

Hi guys, any plans on tapping into the SEA market? highest rates of crypto adoption is occuring in Asia, most specifically Philippines where millions of people's first financial instrument is a metamask wallet instead of a bank account.

I think it is important to define a hashtag for each event that takes place in ERGO, and that people posting about that particular topic use it. 
There is no better search engine in social networks than a hashtag.

 Lets make It more interesting then , how about tell me the places you are visiting and we creat like a quest game of QR Codes and there is one secret QR Code in location not marked on Map, if the person scans all the Codes and does a TX of 0.001 erg o something like this, they get a nft or something as reward, just a idea to make It more fun... Would like to get more suggestions to how we can make It fun üî•üî•

.@iamhasaniqbal has done a great job!
Now the community has 3 additional sticker designs with QR-Codes.
1. Link to #Ergo manifesto
2. Link to @ergoplatformorg 
3. Link to https://t.co/SrQ2d3rZMw
These work for 4 & 6 cm stickers.

Hey members of the ERGO discord:)

Im not sure if this is the right channel to post this, but Onchain University is looking for instructors/contentmakers on its platform. OnchainUni is offering a Learning Management system for people who want to educate newbies, communitymembers or anybody who wants to learn about Web3. The courses will be freely available for everyone who wants to take the courses.
We managed to get funded by Project Catalyst, so we are able to pay instructors a fee to incentivise them to make courses.
For more information, see the Antimo application page: https://antimo.app/apply_for_role/1654266422867x887406486605791200?tab=1
Or you can send me a DM
kind regards, Raymond from OnchainUni

(re  : *<Halasz> Hey members of the ERGO discord:)

Im not sure if this is the right channel to post this, but Onchain University is looking for instructors/contentmakers on its platform. OnchainUni is offering a Learning Management system for people who want to educate newbies, communitymembers or anybody who wants to learn about Web3. The courses will be freely available for everyone who wants to take the courses.

I know when i joined ergo i said that we need marketing and blabla , i  think at the time i didnt understand the crypto world and neither Ergo, i was all money Game and after being here For almost 5 months now i think marketing Is not what we really need but there is one thing i would really like to propose
Few of us are very active on Twitter and want to Take advantage of that..things we can do
-Daily  posting + retweeting time frames depending on ur time done
For example , 
10 active members at 5:00 pm in Am√©rica and around 3:00 pm in Spain are the time user mostly gets a free time to login to there social...

At that time frame .. main channel does a tweet and  people just retweet on daily bases.
Why to do that?
Posts gets way more interraction when its shared by more then one person at the same time...now that all the users Who Will share have nicely build profile It wont look like spam...

 marketing is what we need - just not what most people consider ‚Äòmarketing‚Äô. 

Having `x` people retweet daily at a certain time I‚Äôm not sure what impact that‚Äôd have an end up with inconsistencies as you‚Äôre relying on other people. 

The type of marketing we need is the part that drives compounding growth - so as someone who is new(sh) to the ecosystem the best thing to do is start contributing to ergonaut.space and adding in bits that tripped you up to make it easier for the next person. Common resources or tweets they can cover, accounts to follow, tricks for twitter marketing, etc. Maybe a seperate Telegram just for Twitter stuff may be worthwhile with people leading it?

Coinbase has user reviews now. Even though $Erg isn't on there yet, you can still leave a review. #Ergo has a 5 star rating so far. Maybe if more ppl leave reviews it'll start catching some eyeballs.

Yeah I‚Äôve already started ramping up the marketing towards miners. I don‚Äôt think we need to try very hard to attract hash considering there‚Äôll likely be too much to go round anyway. 

But we need clear pathways, good explanations of all the cool stuff on ergo for miners, etc.

I think ERGs fundamentals are what should be targeted. Most Miners don‚Äôt like premines. That puts ergo at the top with RVN and RVN doesn‚Äôt have as good as tech.


[06/13/2022 7:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
What RVN has over ERG is there is already lots of Media about mining it since it used to be super profitable so more videos on mining setups would be helpful as well.

Forwarded from Mr_Kwibs: We're making plenty of progress actually. Since we all work out of passion we are not much effected by the market conditions. 

AVAX and ERGO bridges are both as good as ready and will likely be deployed very soon. We also talked to Armeanio over the phone last week about further collaborations.

Meanwhile our web wallet is now client-side based. So no servers to rely on anymore. 

The Conceal App is also ready for its 2nd release with a lot of new features, you can check out the sneak peak here: https://twitter.com/ConcealNetwork/status/1536666286662766592?t=nYV7hoyjBH6lGKs58b9D8w&s=19

You can also read our latest monthly update for all the other things were working on such as a soft rebranding: https://concealnetwork.medium.com/conceal-network-monthly-update-may-2022-c5300b7aaab9

And if you need a refreshment on what CCX is all about we recently released our pitchdeck which is pretty much up-to-date: https://twitter.com/ConcealNetwork/status/1529207314208669698?t=SzVuHWh6b33EY037EiNCQg&s=19

After years of studying it, I believe that cryptocurrency is an inherently right-wing, hyper-capitalistic technology built primarily to amplify the wealth of its proponents through a combination of tax avoidance, diminished regulatory oversight and artificially enforced scarcity.

They could even have a hobby GPU section to learn more about Mining and Decentralization. I think if ERG mining is profitable enough, you could set up miners in each store that pay for the rent and utilities of the building. Idk if ERG mining will be that profitable ever or if there is enough GPUs to go around but just a thought.

you need to use incognito mode for personalized results but i see ergo platform site as #1.

also, using our SEO tools that crawls google search results every day indicates we are #1 as well for the very broad search term for "ergo" (which as glasgow mentioned we wouldn't optimize for anyways).

Impressive we're first tbh, you'd expect we'd be rekt by the dictionary or something

(re @glasgowm : *Impressive we're first tbh, you'd expect we'd be rekt by the dictionary or something*) 
 
 that was my impression as well since we are competing against wikipedia (author rank 21) and merriam-webster (author rank 707) versus our author rank of 153k.

i will have to dig deeper but i suspect it's 1) the volume of mentions from other websites 2) the velocity that we are getting them and 3) optimized anchor text that people are linking back to the site (which associates the crypto to "ergo" related terms)


[08/04/2022 5:05 AM] curbsideprophetz#0000
top external linking anchor texts all have the word "ergo" in it

Forwarded from unknown: Hey Guys, as an effort to get the word out on Ergo, Andy and I discussed a community driven effort promoted by Ergo for an 'Discover Ergo Day'. The goal would be to get many genuine tweets on this day and hopefully start a snowball effect to bring new members onto the community. We do not want to be 'shilly', so the prompt would be something like 'What are your favorite things about Ergo? or 'What brought you to Ergo?'. 

We also want to get a pool of funds for the top 10 tweets. If you guys are willing to put some into the fund please let me know. 

It will be crucial for all projects on Ergo to participate so I ask that you guys get a tweet or a couple ready for the day. 

It will happen September 15th, a few days before the estimated ETH merge. The hashtag we will use is #DiscoverErgo (tg://search_hashtag?hashtag=DiscoverErgo) although i suggest to also add $ERG which is the classic one used. There will be more information coming as we need to make everyone in the community aware that it is coming! 

Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions üôÇ

My suggestion would be to incorporate technical comparisons with the top layer 1 projects if possible and hashtag them as well in order to get to their communities. No negative comparisons bashing other projects, more of a constructive approach so they feel welcome

[08/24/2022 4:57 PM] machinatos2#0000
Tweets with teasing contet. Decentralisation, fair start, sigma protocols, BTC evolution, NiPoPoW (simple usecase), dApps, but also risk reward calculator, max supply, emission reduction. AND MAINLY : GOAL 

They have to be written simple, clearly and attractive - ideologically and financialy.

i would give half to engagement half random


[08/24/2022 5:34 PM] koutelier#0000
so you will spam but with quality


[08/24/2022 5:34 PM] dann#0000
While I also think that giving maybe some % of the whole treasury to a random tweet with #Ergo could also work nicely, as some people would just spam the # with 20 tweets


[08/24/2022 5:34 PM] koutelier#0000
double the% of winning

After this, the proof-of-work chain will migrate to proof-of-stake upon hitting a specific Total Difficulty value. The Bellatrix upgrade is scheduled for epoch 144896 on the Beacon...

NiPoPoWs

Extended support of light nodes makes Ergo friendly for end-users, allowing them to run contracts on common devices such as mobile phones without centralised intermediaries.


[08/30/2022 12:52 PM] glasgowm#0000
Storage Rent

Another unique feature of Ergo is the concept of storage-rent, which is the ability of miners to take out a small amount of Ergs from boxes that have remained unspent for four or more years (the box is spent, and a new box is created with the lower value). This feature also allows Ergo to avoid long-term bloat of the UTXO set.

 I imagine @AndyLowe has it locally / backed up.


[09/05/2022 2:49 PM] AndyLowe#0000
I keep recent files locally but I don't keep every video ever. I can go and download them all and archive them but it would be probably a terabyte or more of data so I would need to invest in a new external harddrive. I'm looking into diversification away from reliance solely on YouTube, for streaming as well. It would be good to store things on more than one place. But I'm also not too worried about YouTube deleting old videos, I feel like they have multiple backup servers and it's not in their interests to sabotage their content creators. 

On the topic of non-reliance on one platform we should also look at an alternative to GitHub, seems much more important than losing old videos, but that's a separate issue.

@Darkkknight111 there is already someone taking the mp3s and making them into a podcast, would this satisfy the same need that you want the mp3s for? I'm not sure exactly what you are working on so please explain what you need and I will try to figure out the best way for you to get it

If you're into proof of work, I'd recommend checking out @ErgoFoundation. Ergo is one of the few coins in the PoW space still innovating and has a great community.

Hey everyone the marketing channel was suggested to me by Glasgow for collaboration on ergonaut.space which is the Ergonaut community wiki. 

Anybody currently (or previously) doing any work on the wiki? I know of a couple like Glasgow √Ör√ñhB√™ and cafebedouin but anyone else that's active here in #üó£‚îÇmarketing involved or interested in pitching in to wiki at any level?

Today we noticed a >20% surge in @ergoplatformorg $ERG and a nearly 12% rise in its TVL.

What is #Ergo and how has it been building so far?

$ERG difficulty is growing super fast (now 3.16 PH) while network hash rate quite stable for a few weeks (around 24TH/s).

Mining profitability goes down despite token price goes up.

Can anyone explain why difficulty keeps growing?

Ergonauts, as many of you may already know, the community initiative known as " #DiscoverErgo Day " was conceived in this group chat, so we will use this group as the main HQ for organising the event and hopefully smashing our target of 2500 tweets containing the hashtag #DiscoverErgo on September 15.  (00:00 utc - 00:00 the next day, 24 hours)

In order to help make this happen, myself and @TheRealErgoGod propose a system where members of this group volunteer to be 'captains' at certain times of the day on September 15. The role of captain will change hands during the day, so for example you could just do 1 hour, then someone would take over from you.  we have people in most timezones so we should be able to cover the full 24 hours. 

Whoever is the captain at any given time will be responsible for essentially 'rallying the troops' - encouraging ergonauts to take part in the event and to keep the momentum going, that would be mainly in this community marketing group, as this will be the HQ for the event. On september 15 we want this group to be a hotbed of activity and all encouraging each other as we collectively spread the word or Ergo!

The captain will also be encouraged to find relevant twitter threads to share the links to here, and to compel ergonauts to go and comment on it, retweet, etc, if it is relevant to ergo.

The captain would also be encouraged to try to maintain the 'rules' of the event, don't shill too much, just inform. this event is about trying to encourage people to discover and learn about ergo. dont mention price action unless its relevant. be polite, etc.

this is a community run event so nobody can really control anyones actions or tell you what to do, but with a little organisation I think we can make it more of a success. 

Here is a spreadsheet showing the current timeslots that are available to be a captain. if you would like to volunteer, message me or J or reply here <clipped message>

Time to Start Crypto Mining ERGO!
Today ERGO got implemented into Zelcore! For me this is the OK to start mining ERGO. Before ERGO was in Zelcore, I was NOT interested in Mining it. Now that It is going to be easy to Mine and acquire ERGO in a decent wallet, I am excited to see what happens to it after the Ethereum Merge.

Ethereum Is About To Change Everything - Prepare Now
Ethereum merge is happening very soon and Ethereum is prepared to change the crypto markets once and for all. The battle of L1s is in play as ETH moves from proof of work to proof of stake. What happens if Ethereum merge fails? What happens if it succeeds?

(re @OlNick : *@AndyLowe what do we actually need to do other than be here?*) 
 
 The whole initiative is to spread awareness in twitter, so make lots of tweets using the hashtag #DiscoverErgo


[09/08/2022 1:35 PM] AndyLowe#0000
There is a Reddit post that explains everything and gives suggested links to find inspiration about what to tweet etc


[09/08/2022 1:35 PM] OlNick#0000
I get that and can tweet myself a bit , but I guess it would be good if people drop their tweets here and as many as possible retweet them

(re @OlNick : *I can be here in the morning for at least an hour possibly two, but I cant say I have been very active here*) 
 
 We are trying to reinvigorate this group at the same time, so the hope is that the 15th will be a hotbed of activity and it will kickstart a new wave of enthusiasm

(re @OlNick : *I get that and can tweet myself a bit , but I guess it would be good if people drop their tweets here and as many as possible retweet them*) 
 
 Yes. That's the idea. We all want to make it a big team effort. There will also be 'captains' whose job will be to make sure we don't lose momentum and drops twitter thread links here to encourage comments etc

We are going to monitor the number of tweets using Hootsuite and another tracking site, our goal is 2500 tweets. But the total prize pool is now more like 4500usd, and we will now reward 50 people. So I think we can easily smash 2500


[09/14/2022 11:39 AM] AndyLowe#0000
At various times during the day there will be 'captains' who will be harassing cajoling and coercing the community to keep up the momentum and get our hashtag trending

[09/14/2022 1:33 PM] AndyLowe#0000
(re @Darkkknight111 : *can someone please provide a template for a post , hashtag etc*) 
 
 The hashtag is #DiscoverErgo .. you can also add other hashtags that are relevant to what you are posting about such as #PoW #mining #Blockchain #Ergo2Top10 (or #Merge if it's about Ethereum merge) etc. 

All this info is in the Reddit post which can be used as a reference for everything. And remember, it's all about informing people, not shilling!


[09/14/2022 2:07 PM] AndyLowe#0000
Top 25 tweets by engagement and 25 chosen at random will share the prize pool. We will check all winning tweets to make sure they are not empty tweets or have no useful content so just spamming the hashtag won't improve chances of winning anything. The whole point is really all about spreading the word of Ergo and the hope is that everyone is behind this objective and not just doing it to try and win some prize

(re @AndyLowe : *The hashtag is #DiscoverErgo .. you can also add other hashtags that are relevant to what you are posting about such as #PoW #mining #Blockchain #Ergo2Top10 (or #Merge if it's about Ethereum merge) etc. 

All this info is in the Reddit post which can be used as a reference for everything. And remember, it's all about informing people, not shilling!*)

Found some spelling mistakes. Don't underestimate how quickly people are turned off by them and assume your product is garbage because of simple mistakes like these.

- Decentralized casino, not decentrelized casino
- Launchpad, not laucnhpad

Also, what's up with the inconsistent placement of the #discoverergo tag? Other than that, great work man! Keep it going.

I recognized that many make threats but put the #DiscoverErgo just in the first Tweet of the threat.

(re @AndyLowe : *The first tweet in a thread normally gets all the shares and likes doesn't it?*) 
 
 Yeah, but all the other ones do not show as #DiscoverErgo Tweets in the KPI.


[09/15/2022 1:03 PM] mrtn_ergo#0000
What I want to say. 
A threat with 30 Tweets and every Tweet contains the Hashtag then all of them show in the KPI. 
If just the first Tweet contains the Hashtag just 1 shows in the KPI.

I wanted to ask about Discover Ergo day submissions on Twitter. I made one submission. If another person makes a hundred tweets with #DiscoverErgo and I only make one with #DiscoverErgo, are they more likely to win rewards?

(re @Bye : *I wanted to ask about Discover Ergo day submissions on Twitter. I made one submission. If another person makes a hundred tweets with #DiscoverErgo and I only make one with #DiscoverErgo, are they more likely to win rewards?*) 
 
 You can also do 100 quality tweets,+ your win rate


[09/15/2022 2:19 PM] Bye#0000
At that point it‚Äôs schilling.

(re @Bye : *I wanted to ask about Discover Ergo day submissions on Twitter. I made one submission. If another person makes a hundred tweets with #DiscoverErgo and I only make one with #DiscoverErgo, are they more likely to win rewards?*) 
 
 If a tweet is lazy and doesn't really contain any useful content it won't be eligible for any winnings


[09/15/2022 2:20 PM] AndyLowe#0000
So quantity alone doesn't achieve any higher chance of winning

I don't know but I would cover the whole year with community actions or initiatives, in addition to the projects and things that EF promotes.  it would be a whole year of engagement.  maybe one lighter and one more powerful but it seems strategically good

‚ÄúThe way I look at the crypto industry is like we‚Äôre still in 1990. We just gained access to the internet and email.

There are so many real world applications for NFTs and the Metaverse that have yet to come to life.‚Äù

We came close to 1000 unique tweets. I think the momentum we built up today was amazing, people will continue to use the hashtag and we will see 1000 before USA goes to sleep. And including retweets, almost 5000 total


[09/16/2022 2:38 AM] AndyLowe#0000
I haven't had a chance to analyse the data yet - will be interesting to see how many people were driving this forward, if it was just a smallish group tweeting like crazy, or if it started to snowball. I saw a few examples of random entities joining the party and tweeting with our hashtag. Thats what it's all about, we must have reached many new people today. Also the lunarcrush thing was nice, showing that ergo socials were on fire. üî• Nice job everyone

Forwarded from K: Definitions change ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, according to the Ergo twitter subpooling means the ability to mine tokens. That was never the definition I had in mind but I think that's how most people have probably learned about the term now.

In that respect, neither my or your definition has any effect on what people think when they hear the term.


[09/16/2022 3:28 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
What about moving it to Tuesday instead?

So that newbies interested in Ergo can then learn more techy bits on Wednesdays dev chats and ask questions on Thursdays' AMAs!

 dont want to share the stats immediately incase anyone draws a premature conclusion from them (ie assumes they have won). need to go through all the data first. there was over 5000 tweets including retweets and the analytics site i was using for the first time. so just gimme a sec to make sure I know what the data is telling me

*After reading & asking **#ergo* *miners "**w_hat is main reason behind turning off there rigs?_"
*There are 3 main patterns in multi-language groups
_- Difficulty
- Ergo price
- Electricity cost
_‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
my main concern here is simple
D*o people know enough about ergo ecosystem and its assets?
*-no
*What  other assets do we have in our ecosystem which competitors dont? what + can we offer to the miner?
*- Nft's ecosystem and great nft artists who would love to help
- Getblok subpools, which can be created fast
- Ergopad , which can help spread the word fast
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
*What do miners like ? 
*Rewards !
what do we need?
keep them happy and no make them focus to much on the daily erg only, give them more options

my proposal is simple , we creat a treasure hunt for miners, what is that?
-Portal which lists subpools of treasure hunt 
 example:
Option one
Ergnomes wants to sell or donate few nfts :
- Setup a subpool free or pay to mine
- Set max hashrate allowed
- Set number of Blocks mining required 
- Random number gets all the extra nfts 
- loosers  get payed in erg of what they mined.
Option 2: 
Ergnomes wants to sell or donate few nfts :
- Setup a subpool as lottery
- Miner buys entry , selects the desired lottery number
- Set max hashrate allowed
- Set number of Blocks mining required 
- loosers get payed in erg of what they mined.

we can  creat Influencers private pools where they can announce merch giveways to the winners
- few youtube mining influencers like the idea already
by doing this , we are providing a + reward on mining
and they are securing our network
Disclaimer:
- looking for devs to help me make this into reality and present for a hackathon

I think the ergoplatformorg's twitter post worked really well
What else could we do?


[09/19/2022 9:31 AM] CW#0000
Could have focused feature days, I.e #ErgoNFTs day, #ErgodApps etc. 

Put a spotlight on what's happening on the chain


[09/19/2022 9:36 AM] CW#0000
As I mentioned on the NFT artist front, our dApps are quite modest. Get them out and about posting what's going on their platform.

For example the AH and sky harbor could post daily sales, and floor prices, and promote different feature sets. 

NightOwl beta coming up in a couple of weeks.

ErgoPad and Paideia are posting constantly and seeing some good engagement.

Just a handful of examples/suggestions there

 There‚Äôs no CMs in any regional communities. It‚Äôs a decentralised ecosystem each region has to run itself. Any roles are merit based (proof of work) from existing community members with dedication to promoting erg.

Hey everyone,‚úã I don‚Äôt understand marketing, but I think we should:
1- Get verified on twitter. 
2- Airdrop of some cool enft project.
3- Get news from the ledger team.

I saw a few people say they couldn't find the discussions for the last AMA in discord because they weren't aware it was in the General channel. We should probably have a mention it's in the General channel when we market it. Maybe in the future we could have a specified Discussions/AMA channel?


[09/20/2022 6:48 AM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
That's a good idea! Let's see what we can come up with :)


[09/20/2022 6:51 AM] Steel#8070
A specified channel would also help with readability for people who don't make it on time and want to check it out later. General chat isn't a good option because all the messages will get lost due to off topic discussion.

üßµ A thread for the #mERGe

As ETH mining vanished into the ether, Ergo hash went 10x before the difficulty started to kick in. We've seen a huge influx of new #ergonauts across socials, and I'm sure many will stick around. Equally, many miners are unhappy with low rewards.

How does a similar event to DiscoverErgo sound for ErgoHack V? Any thoughts? We need to drum up some excitement. Djed Alliance, Flux, Alephium. We should be able to get a lot of applicants. Registration until Oct 2 and the event is Oct 3-20. Maybe we could coordinate for later this week or early next week?

Hackathon - ErgoHack V
Welcome to ErgoHack V! Ergo‚Äôs hackathons have become an incredibly important and identifying feature of the blockchain after four highly successful events in the past year.

 Absolutely, that is a great idea


[09/20/2022 5:15 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
Today is the 20th, so maybe we could make an effort and spread it over the whole of next week starting Monday?
We could focus both on details of the upcoming one but also celebrate past winners (I can get you guys those)
Hashtags could be #discoverergo and #ergohack of course but we could/should add #hackathon, #devs (at least) to reach a broader audience


[09/20/2022 5:16 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
We could/should also tag (where we use graphics of any kind) the projects mentioned, ergoplatform, but also alephium, djed and flux to reach a broader audience

- keep them simple or add flags in bg ?
Personal preference 
- without flags because most of languages are used in more then one county

-  we need some serious community stuff sharing people and a few shillers too (this industry needs it)
- The main concern now is the difficulty and let's promote getblok subpooling and +25% rewards.
- find Nft artists who would like to drop some giveaways or maybe some attractive offers
*When we have new difficulty numbers
*- Let people know on their own and we prevent a few % of incoming hash

@glasgowm . I'm new to Ergo. I did good amount of research and decided this project has a very good chance of becoming one of the dominant PoW projects in the mid to long term future. For that reason, I have accumulated a very significant position in ERG. I'm not really technically oriented and I don't have the time to mine and maintain a mining rig. Is there a way I can put my ERG to work to earn more rewards? Or mining is the only way. Thanks.

I'm not a bot or scammer. Just a new guy to ERGO trying to learn and get to know the community.

(re @glasgowm : *This is what you‚Äôre looking for*) 
 
 But staking on ERG is not live or ready yet, right?


[09/22/2022 3:39 PM] glasgowm#0000
well it‚Äôs proof of work so there‚Äôll never be actual staking on the base layer


[09/22/2022 3:40 PM] Dizer#0000
I meant a mechanism to somehow deploy my ERG to earn more ERG. Perhaps lending apps or some other DEFI mechanism


[09/22/2022 3:40 PM] glasgowm#0000
(re @glasgowm : *Some options here; more in future

https://ergonaut.space/en/Guides/yield*) 
 
 Yes the available options are listed here. Spectrum SigUSD/ERG pool probably safest bet. duckpools is also in beta testing. ErgoLend soon, and a few other options


[09/22/2022 3:40 PM] theta_decay#0000
(re @Dizer : *But staking on ERG is not live or ready yet, right?*) 
 
 Staking is only available for ergo native tokens via smart contract. To earn yield on Erg, the link Glasgow provided is your guide.


[09/22/2022 3:41 PM] Dizer#0000

Registration for the upcoming #ErgoHack is still open! 

Great opportunity for #developers & #miners to submit ideas/proposals around #mining & #minting.

Exciting time to be building on #Ergo & to be a part of the #Ergonaut community.

I don't know if the tools exist, but if they do, I think we should reward miners who are hashing from now to the end of the Epoch with a special 'We overcame the mERGe' NFT? As a bonus, some miners will view it as an incentive to turn their rigs back on.

But besides these honorary mentions, the main goal is to push the ergohack which should attract a whole lot of ppl if done right
It's a bearmarket for everybody, so the pool prizes should be enticing to devs that maybe are out of work/wouldn't have normally participated
And miners are just roaming aimlessly for something to bet on after ETH went pos

Hey everyone, just an idea but maybe a video tutorial on how to read and use the difficulty & epoch monitor could be worthwhile?

It‚Äôs great we have this, but a lot of people don‚Äôt know how to read it or what it all means.

@seedubya


[09/26/2022 4:47 AM] bennyk2#0000
If we can establish things like this as a standard, people will go to other blockchains and ask ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the difficulty monitor?‚Äù

And so ergo becomes the standard for others to live up to, a bit like the Eth has been up to this point.

Guys from EU.
What is your strategy to buy crypto, mainly erg ATM?
When you convert eur to dollar 100 corresponds around 97 dollars. Assuming value of erg stays the same or you keep your money in a stable coin if euro/dollars goes from 0.97 to 1.2 again the 97 dollars will correspond to around 80 euros... S√≥ we are losing more than 20% just converting eur to a stable coin or buying a crypto assuming price stays the same... Any tips?

What you can do is , convert into sigusd or any other stable coin, because euro hit 0'9588 this morning...more drops to come in next days... Today is a key day for EU

I doubt most ppl (and even most hobbyist miners, which are addressed by the video) will get the point or even an idea what it means. 

I think we need some more "press style" footage on what makes Ergo special by explaining its features with easy language. And maybe some all day usage examples.

Does such material exist?

My views on the "@IOHK_Charles Gifting his old spare account to Ergo" event
There's nothing to do a drama about, if that account would had "real 600k" ETC only fanboys who followed it only for ETC will surely unfollow after this event and refollow the new account with the handle.

 There is a plug-in that accepts Ergo, SigUSD and a bunch of other crypto currencies that you can use in a UI.  https://cryptocurrencycheckout.com/coin/ergo

But for the dropship programs im not sure if any of them accept crypto to hold on the account as collateral basically.  It doesn‚Äôt really cost you anything. Just stored on the account if something goes astray.  Also for KYC I‚Äôm sure.

this seems like paying people with monopoly money for talking about real money, or is that crypto in a nutshell?

The token is on spectrum, in the roadmap we plan to allow ErgOne & ergo owners to tip twitters, choose the next project to support‚Ä¶

 Oh yeah I know its not off the ground yet. but I imagine you could tie this to any hashtag and then funding could be provided from any project


[10/22/2022 5:22 PM] MKUltraCorp#1953
such as what utility beyond a store of value does the project offer, how was the projected founded and funded, how active are the development teams, is there a roadmap with clearly stated future goals, etc


[10/22/2022 5:22 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
For example, if blitz wanted a marketing campaign, they could provide funds and you'd set up the bot to pay out when their hash appears


[10/22/2022 5:23 PM] k0ukarin#0000
We have 4 groups depending of results of users: 
- 25% most actives will earn 60% of monthly rewards
- 25% less active will earn 25%
- 25% users again les active 15%
‚Ä¶


[10/22/2022 5:23 PM] MKUltraCorp#1953
and 25% don't use it and will earn 0?

 Makes me wonder if you'd be better off with a sort of vending machine for people to redeem their tokens, rather than LP that can fluctuate in value. I'm just spitballing my thoughts, don't let me annoy you with ideas. Glad you're working on this!

 People that say this often don't know anything about marketing. For example, I haven't read the paper above, but the text here suggests an incentive system for marketing. In a marketing plan for a particular product, you have to identify things like: who are you talking to? What media do they use? What do the like about your product? What don't they like? How will you measure the effectiveness of your marketing campaign? Etc. So, as an exercise, who is Ergo's target market? Is it young men who already use crypto and are on Twitter? Is it people who have never used a cryptocurrency before? Maybe you want to increase engagement with people that have already used Ergo? These are the types of questions that people that think Ergo needs marketing haven't thought about or answered, because they often don't know jack shit about putting together a marketing plan.

 Is it?

In my agency, planners would have called people on crypto twitter, "brand believers", people that are already invested in something and may not even be willing to try your product.

I'm probably that for Ergo. I'm largely not interested in the cryptocurrency of the week.

 Not sure you can compare ergo to a ‚Äúproduct‚Äù.

The idea is to make:
- silent twitter users more active promoting ergo
- YouTubers create content about ergo


[10/22/2022 5:41 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @Giufa : *These are the users of twitter oriented crypto*)

 Ergo is both a product and a story. You have to know what story you want to tell and who you are telling it to before you market anything.


[10/22/2022 5:43 PM] MKUltraCorp#1953
@cafebedouin thank you for digging in deeper on this - I think these are questions that we should be asking about ANY marketing efforts for Ergo


[10/22/2022 5:43 PM] Giufa#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *Imagine for a moment you were marketing a new cryptocurrency to me, trying to win me over from Ergo. How would you do it?*) 
 
 I don't understand the nature of your question
We are not here to promote a cryptocurrency

But to encourage Ergonauts to tweet about their favorite token (ERGO)


[10/22/2022 5:44 PM] MKUltraCorp#1953
so if someone uses the #ergo tag on twitter, but in a negative context, do they get rewarded?


[10/22/2022 5:45 PM] Giufa#0000
Our audience is as I said #ergonauts
Because they know ERGO better than anyone else

and what better way to talk and share about their favorite token than as an Ergo fan


[10/22/2022 5:46 PM] k0ukarin#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *Ergo is both a product and a story. You have to know what story you want to tell and who you are telling it to before you market anything.*) 
 
 Ergonauts will decide the story‚Ä¶ each of us has is own story about ergo and crypto and we are free to share it how we feel it.
Some are interested by charts, others by tech, others community‚Ä¶
Everyone can talk about what he likes.

 So, the reality is we are talking about a decentralized incentive system. The question is: what are you incentivizing? Depending on how it's done, you may very well incentize shilling.

 I think cafe has a good point. Perhaps a goal of yours could be to assemble a marketing toolkit for people. After you see some success, you could use earnings to hire a legit consultant to empower people to be more effective with their marketing.

(re  : *<MKUltraCorp> so if someone uses the #ergo tag on twitter, but in a negative context, do they get rewarded?*) 
 
 Yep, if it receives a lot of likes and retweet.

If you read the paper, there is also a specific role of Architects that are here to keep the core value. (Validating some tweets points and so on). They also will earn some rewards


[10/22/2022 5:50 PM] Darkkknight111#0000
Ok, why twitter any YouTube? Why not make a portal and rewards on uploading content on it ? Like YouTube for example


[10/22/2022 5:50 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I also think he has a point about going directly after crypto twitter. We want new users. I think twitter and youtube are good to pursue, but a million views by btc maxis will not reap much reward


[10/22/2022 5:50 PM] Darkkknight111#0000

 We encourage them to shill
In compensation they receive tokens and NFTs

These NFTs will serve as a governance tool

For example: decision making by all "Architects" via community votes

(re @Darkkknight111 : *@glasgowm  thoughts on this?*) 
 
 Think it‚Äôs a solid idea on the marketing front, I‚Äôve been thinking of ways to try and implement something like this into Ergo myself. We even have a proposed Twitter rewards campaign ongoing for Sigmanauts at the moment. Small improvements like this in the ‚Äògrowth mechanism‚Äô can yield substantially improved outcomes overall. (especially in an area like crypto where 90%+ of growth is due to network effect). 

Token doesn‚Äôt cost anything and the product capability and ethos encourages referral.   

I imagined it‚Äôd be a DAO/funded by donations that wasn‚Äôt too concerned with value but launching it as a token with a foundation may work too, changes the optics a bit though and make sentiment the biggest hurdle. 

Fonts/Colours/Padding on website will also raise flags

(re @k0ukarin : *Here the post Announcement of the announcement üòâ:

We have built a tool to reward most active ergonauts on twitter (and YouTube).

A kind of #DiscoverErgo day but every day.

The ergonauts subscribe to the app and just have to tweet with the #ergo.

The tool automize the analisys of retweets and likes and reward them with a  token (ErgOne).

The idea in the long run is to create decentralized marketing but the first years, it will be dedicated to Ergo. Here a link to understand how it works:

It's long enough for that amount of SigRSV to actually be worth something. Also, if this works, it might take years for it to be established as a token with some value.


[10/29/2022 7:24 PM] cafebedouin#0000
With this set-up, each Wooden Nickel starts at 0.01 SigRSV.


[10/29/2022 7:29 PM] Gstoiti#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *It's long enough for that amount of SigRSV to actually be worth something. Also, if this works, it might take years for it to be established as a token with some value.*) 
 
 I am not sure that the value of SigRSV will increase a lot long-term. Can always happen that the market crashes 2033, the reserves are basically empty and the value of SigRSV is back where it is now.

Did you think about pairing it with another token?


[10/29/2022 7:30 PM] Gstoiti#0000
For example, Neta or Exle


[10/29/2022 7:55 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @Gstoiti : *For example, Neta or Exle*) 
 
 People are free to create other pairings, if they wish. SigRSV is a leveraged long on Erg and SigUSD adoption, which makes the most sense to me. The idea the SigRSV will be drained is possible, but I think very low probsbilty. It's the token I like best on a 12 year timeline.

 It's not a leveraged long on Erg and SigUSD adoption. If it were a long position on Erg and SigUSD adaption that would mean that if the Erg price and SigUSD adaption (=circulating supply?) are higher than at the time you bought, your SigRSV should be worth more. But that's not always the case.

But SigRSV might be a good choice for locking, because it's not a governance token.

But that's not always the case.

 Maybe not always true on a 1.5 year time line, but probably 99% chance it will be in 2035 if price of Erg goes up from current levels and SigUSD gains more than 10x current market cap. 

Further, I'd argue that there aren't a lot of people that have spent the time to understand SigRSV that I have.


[10/29/2022 8:18 PM] cafebedouin#0000
One risk is that DEXY or another stable coin protocol eliminates the demand for SigUSD and limits the upside. If you wanted to eliminate SigRSV risk, then it would be best to use Erg as the pair, that way it is just a bet on the ecosystem, but not the same level of upside.

 Yeah, that's one risk. Another risk is that the protocol is a game versus other players and that they might be better than you, especially if you commit to a hold and do nothing strategy.

 You're fighting the last war on this one. Look at other top 20 stable coins and look at their adoption curves and market cap over time. The way SigmaUSD has traded until now is not how it will be 12 years from now.

 I am just not that convinced as you are, but I am happy to agree to disagree. 

But I think your idea is very cool. If the SigRSV are worth a lot in 11 years it will be a lot fun to watch the top holders list and the "tipping game" will get a lot attention, although it might have been nearly forgotten for years.

 It's both a promotion and a kind of art project. Also be interested in having this kind of IDO and the yearly LP returns which should be fairly easy to figure out. So, doing it because I think there's interesting information that might come out of it.

Hello Everyone, you might think am a bot or an imposter I get because I use to think like that too when I see messages like this but I can prove to you am 100% real if maybe  my account won't get spam after this message.
I am from spain by birth and have a citizenships in England 
Anyone who as suffered on the hands of crypto like me will totally say am saying rubbish but it's the truth. I have encouraged so many loss that I gave up on crypto for 2 years and something out of the blue just told me to try but this time with a research and I did made a couple of them and came across this platform.
I don't want to say much because am busy at the moment but this companies is sure and legit just don't give like I did, I mean of I found this company 2 years ago I would have gone far but you have an opportunity now you make your own decisions and only fate can help you ü´∂ü´∂

Not sure if it has been discussed earlier. tip.cc has reduced the listing fee by 50% until 25th Nov.
(Cite: List your coin/token with @hart (or via listings@tip.cc), prices start from $500, and in most cases are that.)

Any ideas about that?


[11/18/2022 7:15 AM] glasgowm#0000
I imagine those prices are based on erc20s which don't need much work.

yes, or bsc. anything with its own chain is prob. more expensive as it needs anew node...


[11/18/2022 12:48 PM] essaias#5787
but my intention was to find out what you guys think about a listing: might that help adoption and awareness?

(re  : *<essaias> yes, or bsc. anything with its own chain is prob. more expensive as it needs anew node...*) 
 
 I‚Äôve emailed and asked either way but its criminal spending erg at these prices üôÇ

(re  : *<essaias> but my intention was to find out what you guys think about a listing: might that help adoption and awareness?*) 
 
 Maybe if we get people spamming people with erg on other discords


[11/18/2022 12:54 PM] essaias#5787
well let me try a comparison: I know flux is on it for some yrs. but that "spamming" usually occurs not with it but some tokens or other sht coins. 
ppl are happy when you "airdrop" flux, but its traded/kept as a rare gem. I foresee the same for ergo.

 I‚Äôm not sure the significance of what you‚Äôre saying. So you think it‚Äôs a low-impact/bad thing?


[11/18/2022 1:11 PM] essaias#5787
I really cannot tell. I am sure it boosts awareness, but not sure it will have a big impact.


[11/18/2022 1:12 PM] essaias#5787
thats why I'm asking for other opinions and not just suggesting it


[11/18/2022 1:17 PM] glasgowm#0000
oic, yeah I‚Äôd imagine you‚Äôre right. Maybe the odd person checks out ERG from it, but probably pretty low numbers. Maybe if we could get them to implement native tokens too, and people could make up their own and start tipping their pals, etc it could gain a bit of momentum that way though.


[11/18/2022 1:26 PM] essaias#5787
yes, probably. IDK if the funds are available in the EF or a dedicated marketing fund

@ergomergoadargo The #Ergo community has been steadily growing over the past two years. 

A look at total social engagements in the 2-year time period tells you that the community has grown tremendously.

I strongly suggest to increase the fee if you want faster transaction confirm times.

I would appreciate if you gave me feedback and warned me about bugs in case you find any.

1) Ergo builds on the 10 years of blockchain development,  

2) And combines tried-and-true concepts with the top peer-reviewed academic studies in encryption, consensus models, and digital currencies.

The huge gap in market cap b/t ERG and ADA is surprising, given that ERG is such a capable chain.

üî• The Ergo Foundation is pleased to announce that users can now use Babel fees to pay for transactions on the blockchain. This important update significantly increases efficiency for performing transitions on the network.

With the introduction of Babel fees on Ergo, users can now pay for transaction fees without $ERG. Simply put, Babel fees now allow a wallet to use native assets to pay transaction fees. This new technology greatly increases accessibility on Ergo, as some users may have several wallets where they only hold NFTs or other native Ergo assets. In those scenarios, those wallets would have had to procure $ERG in order to commit a transaction on the network. Going forward, a user can use the native assets they hold in a wallet to complete a transaction (as long as Babel Fee Bank Box).

For full details and how to use this new feature, please see the latest blog post on üëâ Babel fees

$SPF is going to be the biggest investment opportunity Q1 2023 in #Crypto for many reasons its possible @SpectrumLabs_  could surpass the $ERG MC easily as they roll out update after update - I won't be surprised if they smash the ceiling.

 I suggested to creating a rewarding system for sigcans to check there dedication and qualifications , portal where you list tasks and people can assign themself,and get rewarded

(re @HQ3rr : *I suggested to creating a rewarding system for sigcans to check there dedication and qualifications , portal where you list tasks and people can assign themself,and get rewarded*) 
 
 I was thinking about something similar for normal users. Imo one problem Ergo has is that people aren't using the chain, they are "just" investing. My idea would be to create a list of tasks and assign points to each task. If someone completes the task, he gets the points added to his overall score. It should work like gamerscore and achievements for xbox, playstation, steam etc.

Could be tasks like:
- make a swap on Spectrum
- provide liquidity on Spectrum
- withdraw liquidity on Spectrum
- make a p2p transaction
- make a transaction with increased fees
- mint a nft in the auction house
- buy a nft on SkyHarbor
- mint SigUSD
- ....

Then we could make a website with addresses/wallets and rank their scores. Could also distribute prizes to the first x ranks or probably better make a lottery for everyone with a score higher than y.

Imo the real problem is verifying that people completed the tasks. Since I am not a dev, I have no idea what can be checked with apis and bots (e.g., Spectrum transactions, minting nfts using the auction house). Manually verifying might be possible atm, but not if the ecosystem grows.

 You talking about the the old "do this to download this"but in this case you recieve tokens


[12/05/2022 10:25 AM] HQ3rr#0000
I can find something web 2 like that but payments would need to be done manually and not sure if that's what we are looking for ...


[12/05/2022 10:33 AM] Gstoiti#0000
No tokens. Just a score on a website. Like all the gaming platforms do it. It is important that you can't buy a score (hence, no tokens). Should motivate people to use the chain through competition with other users (My Sigmascore is 2300, I am an Ergo og, yours is only 450, you are a noob üòÖ). Could also display the score on social profiles (like reddit or telegram), but that would mean linking wallets to socials, which is not really fostering privacy. The score is just for flexing and maybe taking part in lotteries once in a while.


[12/05/2022 10:34 AM] Gstoiti#0000
It's just an idea. I am just not satisfied with that the majority of people don't use blockchains, they just buy and hold.

How about a dapp and token for sending emails or texts that you can invite people with. Maybe a reward for signing up and signing people up.

They could ask for hackathon funds for token liquid or just pay out erg

(re  : *<Jpow> [reply]: like that ur trying to improve engagement with the chain buy please lets not start a social credit score üòÖ*) 
 
 Lol üòÖ. It would give you points only for the first time doing something and one can't lose points. As I said, it's more about flexing. 

One could also run it differently. Every dApp could distribute (unlimited) stamps to users and once someone has 10 stamps from different dApps he can change them for a NFT. One could use fungible tokens as stamps and let people trade them. Maybe that's less social credit system like and would encourage using the chain. But there is the risk of people farming stamps. However, since they are for free and unlimited I don't think that risk is big. But one would need to limit the NFTs.


[12/07/2022 5:45 PM] Jpow#2124
I was mostly joking, i like leaderboards üòõ As far as usage vs speculation, it's kind of normal. It's not like there is much to do on chain for casuals like me. just need more project that are easy to use and provide real utility like Spectrum to come online and usage should rise along.


[12/07/2022 5:47 PM] Jpow#2124
As far as im concerned, there needs to be way more speculation on ergo, because if we want people to build on the potential that the chain offers, price appreciation is a pretty big part of the incentive.

Hey #Ergo frens üëã

Occurred to me that a lot of your dApps are already designed for eUTxO architectures!

If you're interested in porting your dApp to Cardano ‚òéÔ∏è me maybe?

He's a big dev in the Cardano space, this would be huge for Ergo dapps!


[12/09/2022 1:36 PM] Jpow#2124
How would that create value for ergo tho?

(re  : *<Jpow> How would that create value for ergo tho?*) 
 
 Puts a spotlight on them


[12/09/2022 2:55 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
Loads of Cardano peeps I met at cnftcon and the summit didn't even know Ergo had smart contracts nor NFTs


[12/09/2022 2:56 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
this gives us a chance to show them how advanced the ecosystem is


[12/09/2022 4:22 PM] Jpow#2124
I don't see how it does anything like that without ada users interacting with the ergo network. It's basically using ergo as a test chain for ada at this point, while it can create value for projects, it doesnt create any value for ergo itself if the fruit of the labor moves over to benefit the ada ecosystem.


[12/09/2022 4:23 PM] Jpow#2124
For value to be created for ergo than ergo needs to be used to interact with the products, not ada.


[12/09/2022 4:24 PM] crandano#0000
(re  : *<Jpow> I don't see how it does anything like that without ada users interacting with the ergo network. It's basically using ergo as a test chain for ada at this point, while it can create value for projects, it doesnt create any value for ergo itself if the fruit of the labor moves over to benefit the ada ecosystem.*) 
 
 I think it depends on the project. Spectrum and ErgoPad would be good examples where if you're within the app you'd have the ability to easily interact with Ergo as well as Cardano. The same would go for a NFT Marketplace.


[12/09/2022 4:26 PM] crandano#0000
(re  : *<Jpow> For value to be created for ergo than ergo needs to be used to interact with the products, not ada.*) 
 
 there could be use cases to bring ADA over to Ergo and use it and vice versa


[12/09/2022 4:27 PM] crandano#0000
imagine Paidea's DAO tooling maybe Cardano DAOs would like to utilize it? the barrier to do things from one chain to the other will keep getting simpler for the end user over time


[12/09/2022 4:28 PM] Jpow#2124
but if you're an ADA user, why would you interact with ergo if all the dapps with valuable usecases on ergo get ported over to ada?


[12/09/2022 4:29 PM] Jpow#2124
I fail to see what incentive would ADA users have to switch over to Ergo for any reason what so ever if there is nothing they can't do on ada that they could on ergo. having unique products that are valuable to users is the incentive, if you port that over than whats the point?


[12/09/2022 4:33 PM] Jpow#2124
For instance having a bridge that lets ada users move to ergo to interact with products that arent available on ada would create value for ergo.


[12/09/2022 4:34 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Cross-chain apps increase familiarity and brand recognition. I started with Ada and moved to the Ergo ecosystem because Yoroi supported both. The more I learned about Ergo, the less interested I was in Cardano.

üëç 

[12/09/2022 4:35 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Same effect can happen with a dApp, Spectrum is an obvious example.


[12/09/2022 4:52 PM] Jpow#2124
i can see how it's beneficial to a project to be on multiple chains, i don't see how it's good for the niche L1 coin. Just doesn't seem like a worthy tradeoff. Can't say i've ever started carrying about a coin just because it was in a multicoin wallet xD

[12/09/2022 9:47 PM] MKUltraCorp#1953
i think putting both ergo and ada into the same arena gives the crowd the choice to cheer for pos or pow, whichever way they lean, while generally cheering for a unified team


[12/09/2022 9:49 PM] MKUltraCorp#1953
here is this great dapp that lets you use either or - you might not have access to it if you leaned towards the other proof method


[12/09/2022 9:53 PM] MKUltraCorp#1953
Look at it from the perspective of a shop owner (the dapp in this case). For years, you have been loyally selling brand A, but customers have started asking more and more about brand B. Do you turn them away and give the business to competition or even worse, deny your customers access to a product they have come to you about and said "Hey, stock this and I will buy it, so will others."


[12/09/2022 9:54 PM] MKUltraCorp#1953
There are a lot of things to consider as that shop owner before making a decision. Will bringing in brand B diminish your relationship with brand A? Will your other customers get upset or confused by you stocking both brands? If the answer is no to both, I think it would be smart to stock both brands.


[12/09/2022 9:55 PM] MKUltraCorp#1953
Not only does it give your customers choice, it helps keep brand A honest about their pricing, ethics, etc. because competition makes the world work.

Forwarded from Tefcek21: Most of the media's attention goes to centralized projects that aren't open source or transparent, even though these projects tend to be the least useful and valuable.

Even though Ergo and Cardano are becoming more important, they haven't gotten the attention they deserve.

Instead of focusing on rug pulls, fake news, and centralized projects that don't add much value, shift your focus to projects that are decentralized, open-source, and transparent.

‚ö†Ô∏èWe want everyone in the Ergo ecosystem to support this post so that the media and the general public will pay more attention to projects that deserve it.üßë‚ÄçüöÄ

Did you know ‚ÅâÔ∏è

$ERG / $BTC trades on @bisq_network were 5-10% higher than market üí∞

People value trustless anonymity and will pay for it üßê

A strategy could be buy BTC on CEX > Sell on #Bisq at premium > Repeat üåÄ

Ergo has a problem, and it's not tech related.....How can we bring USERS into the ecosystem? [Marketing]
There have been a few campaigns focusing on this. The #DiscoverErgo event on Twitter, not to mention all the great infographics the community has pumped out. (Linked at the bottom of this post) 
This is linear marketing, and a vital component in kicking off exponential growth-- providing the right foundations are in place. 
Poor retention is a killer and vital for growth, so before worrying about...

 Honestly it was the first free image of a roulette I found, I am not a gambler so I didnt even know there were different types of roulette, but I would have probably chosen this one even if I knew at first.

After all there are 5 more games in the site where you can gamble with fair odds and multiply from 2 to 10 your bet if you want to play that rather than roulette, I am not winning anything on those except for a small fee.

Anyways I just want to eventually build every single game possible, adding both roulettes American and European should take almost no effort, just finding a free image of an European Roulette with no copyrights or anything

 I think craps would be a good game for this. More complex, but it's a fun game.

Would be interesting if people could play together on the same board. Or with the same dice rolls at least, and you could see all active bets

 That would be very cool, but if I were to do such thing I would start with simple things such as a "multiplayer" ergflip, where the coin flipping would be the same for many people

Ergo has a problem, and it's not tech related.....How can we bring USERS into the ecosystem? [Marketing]
Very interesting proposals, especially on repo! 
On bringing users, I think, it makes sense to use different languages and tools for different groups: 

people who are already in crypto, for Ergo and projects no need to invent anything, people who are already in the space usually do understand Proof-of-Work, limited emission, DEXes, etc
tech-savvy people (digital artists, developers): they need fo...

For @drehaf For Ergo Champions, we have prioritized being able to help others through our project. In the past, we have collaborated with Blitz TCG in a charity fundraiser for Filipino families. Now, honouring our initial goal in our roadmap, we are taking 3% of mint profits and aiding in sponsoring a feeding program here in the Philippines. We have a part of helping various families and over 120 children. Today on Dec 31st, myself and other sponsors are hosting games for adults and kids in different Baranguays (small communities) where there are prizes for everyone. We are also handing out essentials to families and providing lunch and dessert for everyone who shows up. Here are a few pictures I‚Äôve gathered so far.

Update from Walrus DAO. The sale of Degen Divers will continue by random sales processor on Saturday 14th January at 12 a.m. (midnight) UTC. The price will be 18 ERG. There are 255 Divers to sell. As a recap, we sold 45 on the Auction House, but had to stop the sale because there were too many fakes. After all the Divers have sold there will be an airdrop to holders of 1,000 WALRUS per NFT.

Hello everyone! I love this new initiative where we can share the news of our projects.

Within my project allcyberpunk.com, the first Cyberpunk Collection is sold out, and can only be found on the secondary market, at the Auction House or SkyHarbor.

I am working on my new collection Cyberpunk Mythology, based on the mythology of different cultures, will be my cyberpunk interpretation of some of the characters from those stories that have been passed down from generation to generation. 

I haven't said the release date yet, but it will be very soon! üî•

For Blitz TCG - Card Artwork completion is reaching 70% complete, so something like 120 out of 170 characters/cards needed for Blitz's release are finished. There is a special art collab being worked on between us and someone you all love within the Ergo Community, so stay tuned for that. The months of January/February will be used to focus on the website a bit as it's been in its current state for a couple months and I want to get Cardano integration up and running alongside Ergo. I also want to release our Lore pages because Lore is cool :). At some point in late January/early February, I will post a new build to the Discord for people to play around with, and probably organize a small event for us to test matchmaking (i.e. two players finding one another for an online match and that match being initiated).

- Trying to help push to ball forward on koinly

- kind of a lull in utxo alliance news because of the holidays. crandano and I are hoping to find ways of bringing the community in there. If you are a project seeking to get more involved with the alliance let me know. Current ‚Äúofficial‚Äù alliance meetings seem very focused on L1 and foundation-based collaboration, but i still want to support projects building on top to find cross chain collaboration

- no news from sigmaverse for a while. Dmitry busy helping spectrum with their yield farming development so that is priority

- been helping exle with private testing, and also anetabtc wrapping with private testing. Both are going well, iterating on bugs found

**[CYBERVERSE]**

**üö®IMPORTANT UPDATE TO BE DONE BEFORE RELEASEüö®**    
-Apartments building and data in the game and server ‚úÖ 
-Load apartments as you load the character NFT from wallet address ‚úÖ 
-Another update for the apartments in the server, split the apartments data from the user data ‚úÖ 
-Added all 250 ErgoPixels NFTs of walls ‚úÖ 
-Added Music NFT/token ‚úÖ 
-Fully integrated CYPX and ERGO token in the game  ‚úÖ 
-Split the character NFT data from the user data (in server and database)  ‚úÖ 
-Start of using a true database, convert all the demo data in a server to a true data from database, load, save and get a true data that won't be reset. ‚úÖ 

**ROADMAP UPDATE**
**üîí Connecting Wallet  ‚úÖ **
 We are proud to announce the login and authentication for entering the game is completed! We will prepare new UI for the page.
‚ùì **How does it work?**
    Upon visiting our page, you will be able to connect your wallet via nautilus, after connecting, the server will generate a code corresponding to the fee amount you are instructed to send (~0.0014$). You will have 2 minutes (120 seconds) to complete this, our server will keep checking if the correct fee has been sent by the indicated address. After the user sends the fee, our server will check to ensure the correct amount has been sent by cross-checking the amount sent with the generated code. Once this is completed and the server verifies the correct amount has been sent from the correct wallet, it will build a random login string and save it within the localstorage for future logins. This login string will be saved in a database for 6 hours, allowing users to login instantly after connecting their wallet.

**CHARACTERS**
We also started working on new animation sprites that includes: jumping, running, fishing, consuming, dancing, drinking..

**WAVE3 REMAINING NFTs**
**CYBERCITIZENS**: 493
**Rewards left:**  
**CYBER EGGS**: 156
**Serum SIG-V1**: 44
**BODY PART**: 9
**APARTMENTS**: 3
**AUDIONFTS:**
**Blue Lights**: 180
**Cybernetic Shine**: 129
**Cyberlykos**: 128
**Hashrun**: 96

üéÆ **ALPHA RELEASE**
This update we were suppose to announce a date for our alpha release, due to delays caused by the holidays and working through issues with blockchain integration, our last few tasks before we planned before launch got post-poned. We hope to deliver a game that is both secure and enjoyable for our launch, requiring us to delay the launch for a few weeks.
The goal is to launch the alpha release of the game in January 2023.

Should we open up to public testing and start developing UX priorities although we know we have some things to clean up?  I would like to stress test our backend a bit - more test's more stress.
Or should we tighten it up a little more first?

We recently released a sneak peek for series 2, Tiger & Magpie, which is in the Korean folk art style. Something which hasn't been done in NFTs before. More reveals in the coming weeks.

Grand Gambit sigmaupdate:

- Just launched the rebranding, so far it is all going smooth.

- Completely new UI for the site www.grandgambit.com, now ergflip.com should redirect to it too.

- Regarding what is coming next... probably fixing some small details and I am starting to research about possible RNG (decentralized results), I also am starting to think about the next game.

My Cyberpunk Mythology collection was released on Monday the 9th and has been very well received by the Ergonauts and CyberErgonauts who follow my project! I want to thank everyone for their support! I have already auctioned at the Auction House a quarter of the collection and practically everything has been sold and in a few seconds! üî• 

The allcyberpunk.com project page is updated with the nfts in the collection and you can log in with your Nautilus wallet and see the nfts you have in your wallet from my two collections.

If you reach the sum of 2500 with the rarity of all the nfts in my new collection you get a free CyberUnicorn! Also if you reach the sum of 3500 in total with the nfts of my two collections, you enter the Hall of fame and you get a special Phoenix like this one attached.

The rarity of each NFT is random, it is decided by the blockchain generating the id.
Its rarity level is the result of the sum of each of the numbers that appear in its id.

I will continue minting and auctioning all week long.

I have talked about ways by which ergo can improve its community building and marketing building.  It will be better yo have Regional teams who will create community activities,  marketing,  business development and others including physical and online events that is unique to their regions. 
Second this groups write out proposals which will be vetted by for now the core team from ERGO FOUNDATION ...

Install a full Ergo node simply thanks to Satergo
1. Connect on https://satergo.com/ and download the package
2. Extract files, and run.bat
You'll have a windows security warning you can ignore it without risk
3. Create or import a wallet 

And let's run your own Ergo node !

Many of the significant crypto hacks have been characterized by bridge exploits. They often contain lots of money & have few trusted key holders. Hacks such as the wormhole exploit encouraged the creation of a #Ergo centric bridge put forth by @mhs_sam.

Yo #Ergo people:

Right now the testnet is only mined by 2 ppl. If somebody out there wants to contribute about 30 to 50mh/s worth of hashing power, let me know, and I will get you setup!  Can even mine direct to node, don't need complicated stratum setups.

I continue with my Cyberpunk Mythology collection. I have already minted 75% and I am very happy with the support I am getting.
For now you can find mythological characters like the Phoenix, Dragon, Chimera, Kraken, Minotaur, Anubis, Ganesha, among others. 

The total of the collection is 40 characters, 8 nfts of each one (like the sides of Ergo's octagon), which makes a total of 320 unique NFTs, so very soon the collection will come to an end.

I have launched on twitter a proposal for the Ergonauts and CyberErgonauts to choose one of the mythological characters that I will include in the collection. I leave the link of the tweet for those who want to participate!

Grand Gambit

Not much from me as I had to dedicate more time to my job, the rebranding needed a lot of time.
 
- Working on allowing the user to do faster plays, can probably expect this feature within 1 week aprox.
- Working on allowing to turn down volume of the roulette while it is spinning with a simple slider.
- After that, I want to add a gambling addiction section to help some people with gambling issues.
- Probably after all these points I will start looking for random numbers generation in a decentralized way.

A lot of partnerships for Season 2 have been agreed upon. Our front and back end dev and I are in agreement for them to run our mint again. Also, we are collaborating with the founder of another NFT project who is going to build us a PvP discord bot. I will announce who it is at a later date once part of the bot is up and working. Chris from the Azorus team has also agreed to add another mint address to the snapshot code for us and is going to build another rarity bot for season 2. 
(This is all for Ergo Champions) I‚Äôll have more info to provide soon as well.

 Ergo is still in the stage of building where it‚Äôs putting out lots of stuff like this aimed at devs:

I imagine that perspective will change once more things for end-users launch (EXLE, NightOwl, duckpools, SigmaFi, Paideia, DexyGold, SigmaJoin, etc). 

Comments where though? Twitter? Reddit?

(re  : *<mikeyctc1> r/EthMining - Blaocked me from posting it .*) 
 
 Maybe try removing "ERGO" from the title. The whitepaper does state that the protocol will be blockchain indifferent.

Yeah, I tried and it still shut me down.

Is the focus there mostly on Bitcoin, or has the market really expanded into alt coins? 
What is it about Ergo in particular that draws your attention?

 Yeah, some people view Ergo as a Cardano testnet and that's not cool. 

But from a marketing perspective being included in the newsletter probably doesn't hurt, especially since there is no connection to the Ergo foundation or Sigmanauts.

#hodlergs, as you've noticed- I've taken a step back to reevaluate my campaign. I believe, we can make a bigger impact in #ERGO adoption together. 

Non-developers, let's hear your thoughts on how we can onboard new users. Let's shape a campaign to achieve true decentralization.

you guys want to know something weird. I was in ergo, and cardano at the same time, in 2020 and didn't know they had anything to do with each others marketing lol 
literally ergo was my PoW hedge against eth because of Alex Cherp, and Cardano was something I was also learning about at the time.

I continue with my Cyberpunk Mythology collection.
There are only 4 characters left to be minted, out of a total of 40. One of the characters remaining to be minted has been chosen by the community and another of them is CyberUnicorn who will be given away at the end of the minting to all those who reach the sum of 2500 with the rarity of their NFTs.

I'm launching all the NFTs at the Auction House! Here is the direct link: https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/active?type=all&artist=9fPgLW8jYUbpNxvXA2sCLKaw1t1ULiE4PWMK2XPoY5jcWzEmUAw

I invite you to my website https://allcyberpunk.com/ to see the rest of the project! üî•

Thank you. It did fairly well so far. Wish I would have been able to promote it more last couple of weeks, but hopefully another few pushes this week can help it close strong.

One of our biggest updates to date for Ergo Champions incoming


[01/28/2023 3:28 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
For those of you who didnt know, I collaborated with the founder of AdventurersDAO and hired him to build us a PvP bot for our champions to bring more utility and fun to the project. He exceeded my expectations. The PvP bot for Season 1 is complete and S2 WILL be added a little later. I believe sometime next week (Wednesday Feb 1 I think) you guys will be able to experiment and use the PvP bot but will get a concrete date. Also, although fun is the primary goal, there will be monthly prizes for the strongest warrior ;). You will earn Prestige points or lose them with every battle. Orobor created a ranking table so we can check who is on top and where you fall in the order. Also, there will be a wallet verification component which is a HUGE deal for our project! Orobor has also coded in a way I can reset the points on a monthly basis so that the winner doesnt just run away with 1st place forever. We have also added in random events in addition to rarity based strength so that the rank 1 champion doesnt always win. This is honestly huge guys. Onwards and upwards.

Grand Gambit

Testing quicker bets, it looks like it works, will probably release both fast plays and auto-refund (e.g for buggy plays where the user signs the tx but nothing happens) at the same time within 1-2 weeks.

After that I will probably be listing both EGIO token and Flux token, Flux team have already sent me a few tokens to start with.

I have already minted 100% of the NFTs from the Cyberpunk Mythology collection and almost 90% of them have been sold! 
I am enormously grateful for all the support! It makes me happy to know that there are people from Cardano who have inaugurated their collection of Ergo NFTs with my NFTs.

Ergo NFT Award voting has closed. Will make an official announcement with graphic on Friday. Sent list of winners to award artist so they can complete the personalization of each award. Will start reaching out to winners this week to get wallet address for NFT and try to coordinate shipping of physical tokens. Still some work to be done with awards until they are completed, but hoping to get them sent out within the next 2 weeks. Appreciate everyone's participation in this event and I look forward to an even bigger one next year. Special thanks to @hq3r and ERGCube for hosting voting and for assistance with graphics.

hello ergonauts - 

Discover Ergo: after a bit of confusion its all been sorted out, I have been transferred the funds from the wallet anastasiia from the EF had been using to hold the funds for us. 

For full transparency, the wallet address is: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/addresses/9eXuqcZdnnbwfksDMaSLdmJVyTYi3EqCrUCpBsfkQtUgi7Jn848

Now I need to give out all the tips. I created a new account on twitter to use Luivatras tipper bot, but that account got blocked, probably because it was new and not belonging to a 'real human'? (twitter rules? I dont know). So now I need to try to use either my personal twitter account to give the rewards, or just ask for wallet addresses and send. Might do a combination of the two, since twitter bot would be easier, but I need wallet addresses to send the NFTs anyway for the top 5 winners. 

Hopefully its all distributed soon. whatever happens, this has been a good learning experience so the next community run event like this will be much more smooth.

(re @NoahErgo : *After months of pushing and prodding and working behind the scenes can finally say ergo integration is planned for koinly üòÖ this was purely community effort and really came down to stubbornness lol so serves as good example of how we can organize around integrations*) 
 
 This is brilliant, well done whoever was pushing them. Do you know when it is due to be rolled out?

Season 1 mint has concluded and the rest of the collection is being burned to promote scarcity.

Our PVP bot went live today!


[02/01/2023 10:53 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Orobor, founder of AdventurersDAO has coded several things for our project including: Wallet verification, the PVP bot, ability to check what champions someone holds in their wallet, a Prestige ranking table to show who is leading the PVP charts


[02/01/2023 10:54 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
COMMANDS:

/add_wallet(address): Use this command to register a wallet, than send 0.XXXX $erg from yourself, to yourself to verify ownership.
/battle(your_nft_id, opponent_nft_id): Simulate a battle between two champions.Expects two id number, you must own the first one, you can't own the second one, and both campions must be well rested. The bigger the rarity rank difference is, the less point you gain or lose.
/check_nft(champion_id): Displays a champion and the champions before and after it. Needs only a number, like 1823 for example.
/check_user(discord_name): Check what NFTs does a person hold, needs the full discord name (like orobor#4005 for example).
/display_top_warriors: Returns the top 10 warriors.
/display_top_mages: Returns the top 10 mages.


[02/01/2023 10:54 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Those are the commands that are working with our new PVP bot.

Here is a picture of what our PVP bot looks like!

 Wow. Some dumb comments there at the bottom. The ergo litmus test. If someone hates ergo and can‚Äôt tell you a good reason why, it‚Äôs a pretty clear indicator they are a fanatic investor and not dealing with them can save you a lot of time.

Hey guys, I'm don't keep track of this marketing thread, but wanted to share a thought, I really enjoyed Kushti's recent KYA post and learned a lot. This kind of information could be disseminated better, like education on Bitcoin's security assumptions and hardware requirements versus Ergo's. Learning about these differences  convinced me even more that Ergo is a good direction to go towards considering the foundational goals of the crypto movement, yet they're not readily obvious to a newbie or normie such as myself.

Our PvP bot is LIVE! Orobor, founder of AdventurersDAO has coded several things for our project including: Wallet verification, the PVP bot, ability to check what champions someone holds in their wallet, a Prestige ranking table to show who is leading the PVP charts.

More on our mint: We have the same front end and back end devs running our mint for a smooth and seamless experience for Champion holders. It will be as easy as connecting a Nautilus wallet and inputting how many NFTs you want.

Grand Gambit

I ve been sick, slow progress this week, however quick bets are being tested by some community members, I ve shared the link to test them at Grand Gambit's telegram group. They will probably be officially release at grandgambit.io within the next 1-2 days.

I ve also helped out ErgoLend with some stuff regarding wallets and txs, hopefully I was helpful.

Future developments in mind: PvP is all I have in mind, probably coinflip as the first game, if it is succesful probably some more complex games I guess, ELO.. ranking... we ll see how it goes

Flux token will be also listed very soon

Forwarded from ErgoBridgeBot: <mhs_sam> Rosen Bridge:
as @greenhat  said:" WIP spent some time digging into the custom wasm-bindgen/wasm-pack to enable weak ref TC39 support on CI, but luckily new version of wasm-bindgen came out with our fix, so it's ready for testing https://github.com/ergoplatform/sigma-rust/pull/682"

it's a good news for us; we're going to update the wasm but not for the public test.
- we're almost ready for the public test since the tests are completely done.
- however there are some errors and warnings in the logs, but it seems the bridge is working perfectly and these errors are not critical and will not affect the overall bridge's functionality. We're investigating these logs and will fix any remaining issues.
- we've done a mild stress test with 9 concurrent transfers and the bridge was successful in handling them. By the end of this week, we'll hopefully finish our final stress test with much more concurrent txns. 
- meanwhile, a few improvements and changes are under development, but these changes will not be available and necessary in the public test mode. 
- it seems the public test can begin very soon.

**Announcing Ergada NFT project**

The NFT project "Ergadas" celebrate the collaboration between the Ergo and Cardano ecosystems, highlighting both their distinctive qualities and the shared principles that bring them together. Ergadas are minted on Cardano in a limited edition of 700 NFTs and on Ergo as a 1/1 Concept NFT.

**On Cardano:**
Ergadas are ON-CHAIN NFTs: While IPFS hosted metadata and images are more common, there exists an alternative type of NFTs where the data is stored fully on-chain directly in the NFT token. Instead of a link, the NFT returns an encoded data including svg data that can be rendered in browser.
A SVG offers the same benefits of a vector file but uses shapes, numbers and coordinates rather than pixels, making it resolution independent and infinitely scalable without sacrificing quality, no matter a screens size.

The collection is divided in 7 sets of 100 colors:
1) Mining Ergadas
2) Hodling Ergadas
3) Mooning Ergadas
4) Minting Ergada
5) Staking Ergada
6) Bridging Ergada
7) Interoperating Ergada

Each set of 100 Ergadas in each type is declined in the same 100 colors, so you can collect up to 7 Ergadas for each color!

**On Ergo:**
There is also 1 "original Ergada Concept idea NFT" minted on Ergo:
https://www.skyharbor.io/token/9fda0b43ccde31996ea1b165cf550a3c81d9f194e5fb3d6cdec4e507ecda59f2 
This "Concept" NFT was minted on 3.3.2021 in the following transaction: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/00dcd3d67ecb3513f6b9c5b9fc3de713e4d1b74e529f63d45f20bb1eeaefd28a
This NFT is not for sale and serves as additional on-chain proof of my  ownership of this idea back to this date.
The NFT is named "ERGOxCARDANO. A vision of the future." 

**When mint?**
Ergadas are already minted. You can check them here: https://pool.pm/$ergadas
The public sale on Cardano is scheduled to start on August 19th 2023.

**What is the utility of Ergadas?**
Ergadas are mainly a digital Collectible which aim is to raise the awareness of Cardano and Ergo as close ecosystems, and they will also give you access to exclusive channels in the Ergada Discord and giving the community the networking tools for Cardano and Ergo enthusiasts. The community is also free to suggest any additional ideas.

Fast plays are live! Go check them out at grandgambit.io/pot üíô

https://twitter.com/Grand_Gambit/status/1623676857525628936

How to:

Deposit x amount, once it is confirmed you will be playing with that deposited amount, therefore your next plays will not need to wait for confirmation.

If you press play/spin on a game and the transaction you have to sign is a 0.001 ERG one, it means it is using the funds you deposited earlier in the speed pot and you do not have to send it from your wallet.

Please let me know if you encounter any problem, it is a beta, manage your risks, speed pot deposits are limited for now

Kushti‚Äôs KYA post and Armeanio‚Äôs saying ‚ÄúDecentralization is collective localization‚Äù both  generate visions that are particularly tangible to me. Ultimately to answer the question, in which direction is blockchain tech going and where should I look or partake? Based on the two sources mentioned above, here are a few nuggets that speak to me loudly; objective statements that attract interest of the curious and/or thoughtful.

{Reactions}
k_thumbs_up 

[02/15/2023 12:46 AM] GabGno#6889
KYA
Traditional financial institutions are doing privacy invasive checks known as KYC/AML practices. In a bankless world of cryptographically-powered decentralized finance it is natural to expect reversion of control, that is, now users are checking protocols for their properties.

KYA
Crypto/blockchain empowers the user by giving them control
To be in control is to make decisions to protect oneself
To protect oneself you must know what risks you are exposed to
Banks take on that control over your funds, in crypto you have that control

KYA
In traditional finance, an investment is associated with a projected profit and a risk profile. De-Fi often provides neither with sufficient clarity. KYA

Explicitly state assumptions: Ergo pundits can do more of this
Such as broadcasting details like
For digital signatures, Ergo is using Schnorr signatures (which are simpler, and their security is formally proven) on top of secp256k1 curve used in Bitcoin
Or
For Ergo, since day one the focus was on achieving possible maximum set of features securely from modest Bitcoin‚Äôs set of assumptions, or even to rely on less.

(much more can be said on Ergo security assumptions, but my technical understanding is not sufficient currently)


[02/15/2023 12:46 AM] GabGno#6889
Decentralization is collective localization
Ergo relies on consumer-level hardware accessible to as many people as possible, allowing for best possible distribution of the network.

Decentralization is collective localization
Ergo is friendly to basic consumer-level hardware. Peer-to-peer security is maximized through accessibility.

Decentralization is collective localization
Each peer on the Ergo network can help secure it; Mine with GPU to secure blockchain, Run a node and validate the blockchain.

 Brilliant. Perhaps one day we‚Äôll look back on the ‚Äúfiat age‚Äù where financial literacy and was highly limited among many people‚Ä¶ just like today how we look back on medieval times when literacy (reading and writing) was also severely limited.

SigmaFi needs a nice-looking logo, so I'm offering 50 ERG for the best logo submission. 

  - I like to imagine SigmaFi as a P2P-focused financial services platform on Ergo. So keep this in mind when drawing;
  - The logo must work well on light/dark themes;
  - Accepted file formats: any vector-based format;
  - Submit your work at @sigmafi chat;
  - Submission will be accepted until Feb.22.

Question for the group, if I made 4-5k ergo stickers, would any of you want some mailed to you too to stick around and give out. I have a manufacturing/Distribution agency for a lot of apparel brands and can get stickers really cheap and fast. Could be fun to have Ergo Stickers placed around to world for other ergonauts to run into? Weird part is how would I send them to ergo community and not feel weird about needing addresses. 

The Design I would make would incorporate a QR code for people to link directly to ergoplatform.org 

I‚Äôll probably post a couple options and get a vote on what everyone likes most.

 Cool idea. I think some people would be willing to receive stickers.

<mhs_sam> Rosen Bridge:
- the bridge is under stress test with a lot of concurrent txns. We pushed the bridge till it broke and by this test a few new bugs has be discovered. Now, working on the fixes. 
we will restart the tests after fixing these minor bugs and will test again. Hopefully, it would be last round of tests before the public test launch. 

- we have reported a bug in explorer, causing some issues for the bride (fixed on bridge side):  https://github.com/ergoplatform/explorer-backend/issues/250

Minotaur Wallet:
- version 1.1.3 is released with a few bug fixes.
- if you are using versions older than 1.1.1 I recommend you to delete the database and restore the wallets. Some BIP39-related package has been updated in this period, resulting in a different datatype structure. By recovering your wallet, your keys will be supported by the new version.
https://github.com/minotaur-ergo/minotaur-wallet/releases/tag/v1.1.3

I encourage everyone to use the multisig feature of Minotaur and provide feedback. Storing personal funds in a personal multisig wallet is a good way to improve your safety if you know your assumptions however. 

Anyone familiar with the multisig procedure who wants to contribute? I have an idea to provide a signing service (with fees) that cosigns with you. sth like what green wallet is doing for BTC. So for example you'll have a 2-out-of-2 wallet which one of the signers is this signing server. This service will authenticate you by email/password/otp/etc and will cosign. Bounties are available for this service. Reach me out if you are interested.

Maybe Best Way to Send Stickers out is Like Hubs, Send A bulk out o a few key people in different regions and they can link with members in there area?  or I can send Envelopes out to everyone individually. . Figured if I get 50-100 people that wanted stickers, that wouldnt be to crazy of a shipping cost. couple hundred bucks at most if im sending 30-40 stickers out to a person.

<Luivatra> Paideia:
- @Cheese Enthusiast done with his first review, will take his feedback into consideration as I am going through the "polishing off" phase of the MVP development

NFT/INO platform:
- Digging through the collection and artwork v2 standard and made a mass minter supporting it (initially for internal use), will open up a frontend when tested and used a bit more if the demand is there
- Looking into what it takes to setup an IPFS pinning service allowing for fast image retrieval for NFT's on the platform

Koinly CSV export:
- this is a side project, so havent made that much progress, but aim to have a decent working version before the end of the month
- Remaining tx types are vesting and staking

Im leaning toward 1. & 5. sticker size will be 3-4inches, at the widest/Tallest, slisghtly larger than credit card and fit well in envelopes for shipping. Ive checked QR codes too. You think QR straight to Ergoplatform.org is best? Thats what im thinkning would be..

I only have 200$ worth of COMET at the treasury, I dont think I could afford to do that kind of strategy to make some Flux guys try Grand Gambit, I would quickly run out of COMET.

This has test tokens, not 100% if its still live though

(re @Grand_Gambit : *I only have 200$ worth of COMET at the treasury, I dont think I could afford to do that kind of strategy to make some Flux guys try Grand Gambit, I would quickly run out of COMET.

However what you said is a good idea, maybe I should add a "Free test" page where they could just claim a bunch of no value test tokens and play around with those*) 
 
 maybe something the COMET Treasury wants to support @koutelier - seems to fit with the ethos. But yeah any token would work, removes the barrier of having to get ahold of some ERG at least

(re @Grand_Gambit : *It sounds good but I insist, 200$ worth of comet will disappear way too fast I think*)

[02/21/2023 3:38 PM] qx()#0000
well, they can, but it's only my 50ERG worth and i had no plans to ever rug that anyway


[02/21/2023 3:56 PM] qx()#0000
also, can you integrate babelfees into the contract somehow? so that if you give out comet or love on twitter to a new wallet, they can come to grandgambit, bet love or comet, and then check a box that says "pay tx fee with comet/love" with a link explaining babel fees.....then they don't need any erg. i imagine if you give out tokens on twitter or other places and they come to your site and can't do it because they have no ERG....could be bad or good, not sure yet lol

 Oh wow I havent ever seen anything regarding babel fees, first time hearing it on Ergo but it would be helpful in case they were completely new people with 0 ERG in their wallet


[02/21/2023 5:03 PM] Satergo.com#0000
Do babel fees work with 0 ERG though? I thought every box needs to have a non-zero amount of ERG


[02/21/2023 5:06 PM] glasgowm#0000
The box does but Babel fees can work without erg. So you could receive some comet (with the min erg) and use comet for the tx fees


[02/21/2023 5:10 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Someone just needs to create a large enough box though....

[02/21/2023 6:50 PM] qx()#0000
it was a way to circumvent tx fees with a bullshit token but then i realized it relies on someone ELSE to make the babel box unassumingly thinking it would be a good idea to do so.

essentially...if you make a BS token and provide liquidity in specturm like 1 ERG deep...price is high...then someone else comes along and makes a babel box at that exchange rate, they get boned and essentially are eating the tx fees because your token isn't worth that much in reality and they are making the babel box based on that exchange.

wtf 

[02/21/2023 9:02 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Right. So, for example, you could create a Gambit token, and use that to subsidize transaction fees and eliminate the need for Erg.


[02/21/2023 9:02 PM] cafebedouin#9837

(re  : *<cafebedouin> Right. So, for example, you could create a Gambit token, and use that to subsidize transaction fees and eliminate the need for Erg.*) 
 
 yeah, exactly. but whoever makes the babel box would be the one getting boned.


[02/21/2023 10:20 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I can see where covering tx fees might be a net profit for Gambit. For example, Gambit might cover txs above some threshold, and since the fees are tiny, you'd net profit because you are pulling more interface fees, more bets = more profit for house or whatever. Same principle as a Casino offering free drinks, comping rooms or whatever.

Grand Gambit

- Added both FLUX and EGIO token listings to the site. Announced it through twitter and the tweet got 23k views, Flux's tweet got 18k views, EGIO tweet 1k views, which is quite a record breaking statistic for my twitter account, getting better at marketing üòÖ 

-Also posted this tweet https://twitter.com/Grand_Gambit/status/1628022234152411138 talking about why Ergo was the right choice for me and it got 10k views.

- Notifications section probably coming today, will be helpful to notify users that dont check socials but play daily about announcements such as the prize pool of 15% from Grand Gambit's profits in 1 month for the top 3 biggest winners that I posted on twitter.

- Working on a gambling addiction help page due to someone asking me for it because of past experiences, im glad he asked me for it.

- Future developments/news: gambling help page, getting COMET rewards when you lose/win randomly, naming system for addresses maybe, pvp?

I first joined #Ergo due to its relation to #Cardano, I started building and immediately had some known Ergo developers willing to help me.

Ergo was definitely the best blockchain choice I could make, all I have built was done within 3 months mainly due to the open source spirit

The new type of decentralized exchange we are designing will not be an order book. 

It will be ordered based... 

New DEX on Ergo will use grid order contracts, collectively these can replace liquidity pools. 

The goal here is decentralization and p2p trade.

Also if anyone in the ecosystem is interested in getting stickers made in bulk, i can provide excellent pricing and will take payment in Erg. These sticker were Appx $.12 USD per sticker ( 5" x 2.5" Vinyl), not including shipping, but shipping has been very affordable on them.  I can also help with design for a small fee as well.  Production is typically 2-4 weeks depending on Qty. Shipping typically 5-10 days.

**Grand Gambit**

Added a COMET reward system where every player has a 50% chance of receiving free 10k $COMET (currently 0.12$ which is a solid amount imho, thanks to COMET team for this) for every play made.

Grand Gambit had 1.5k txs a day, which lead me to waking up with a few reported bugs, all fixed now. Last 3-4 days there has been around 3.5k txs done.

Soon I will be listing more tokens within the Ergo ecosystem, known projects by the way.

Soon I will be launching a discord server too for those that use discord and not telegram.

- Adobe has ruined Figma and neutered the free plan :( Moved the ergo figma to Lunacy, mostly exported fine but not perfect. 

https://lun-us.icons8.com/d/fIazIQ_l20y1ofqf4UWrIg?page=JNK_hxOoH0Wh1Xqo8yoT9w&vp=-79433,-32035,29513,16862

- Added a page for the Howey test in light of the SECs drama. May be something the community could push at the moment with this narrative going around? Ergo is well positioned here compared to most. https://docs.ergoplatform.com/security/

- Updating ecosystem standards (Check this page if you're building on Ergo!)
https://docs.ergoplatform.com/contribute/standards/ 

- Created a post for Liquidity Provision/Yield Opportunities and Experiences on Ergo. https://www.ergoforum.org/t/liquidity-provision-yield-opportunities-and-experiences/4220#impermanent-loss

This is something underutilised in the ecosystem we should also try to push as it improves liquidity. Open to any ideas here! Spectrum Farming and other dApps coming out of beta should help a bit.

Satergo - I _intend_ to work on:
- Implementing ErgoPay
- Adding the Ledger process to the UI. The entire protocol is already implemented and works (since 1 year ago, ErgoHack 3. Been waiting for Ledger to approve the ergo app)
- Making improvements to the transaction history, adding support for exporting being one planned feature among others

(These features will hopefully be implemented at that time but the release will be some time after.)

[03/10/2023 4:02 PM] NoahErgo#4349
What do you have in mind?


[03/10/2023 4:06 PM] scasplte2#7091
Awesome üéâ IOG is waiting on some internal things to resolve so we (Topl) met with Ignacio to see how we could continue moving forward in the meantime. We spoke about trying to identify reps from each member org to facilitate this so we could unblock.


[03/10/2023 4:08 PM] scasplte2#7091
If you're up for it @NoahErgo could I ping you in the UTxO discord and connect you with the Topl marketers who will be working on content?


[03/10/2023 4:08 PM] NoahErgo#4349

I suggest we get @AngieHar involved as she deals with marketing in EF as well


[03/10/2023 4:09 PM] scasplte2#7091
I think we just need to identify a rep that would relay to their respective community

Next week I will start to gather info for anyone who would like stickers. Still thinking on what the best method for doing this would be. I'd like ot provide larger amounts to key community members, that could maybe distribute them within their circles so its not to much info  im having to gather. If anyone has a good solution Im all ears.


[03/10/2023 11:19 PM] Austen Milbarge | mikeyctc1#6303
I feel like its weird to be asking addresses, so some of you are pretty close already so maybe best to do it thorugh one individual that already know multiple key memebers info. @drehaf maybe sigmanauts have a solution?

 Most of sigmanauts are from diverse regions of glob, but @dadreboi  can give these a nice utility for the university students


[03/10/2023 11:24 PM] wombo22#5461
- emporas would be one, anyone who purchase anything on their site gets stickers


[03/10/2023 11:24 PM] wombo22#5461

[03/10/2023 11:25 PM] Austen Milbarge | mikeyctc1#6303

[03/10/2023 11:28 PM] Austen Milbarge | mikeyctc1#6303
It doesnt have to be that major either, I do just want to send them to community members that will use them and are active members in the space.

[03/10/2023 11:34 PM] Austen Milbarge | mikeyctc1#6303
Oh, I have no problem Shipping and doing all that. its more about how do I gather community members addresses without them feeling weird and reducing the amoutn i have to gather, if thers a way not to send multple packages to one region, like Australia.. juts send one large amount to one person there and they can maybe send to others in australia..


[03/10/2023 11:38 PM] Austen Milbarge | mikeyctc1#6303
need a mixer for addresses, so you send only a code, but I can ship to that code and it links to an address in a shipping system, but I never actually see the address,ya know..


[03/10/2023 11:48 PM] drehaf#0090
I‚Äôd love to put them up on campus. I can also ship to people if they reveal their addresses to me in the USA. No problem. I‚Äôm pretty doxxed so maybe people feel more comfortable about it. Idk. I‚Äôm in tho for whatever. Just lemme know.


[03/10/2023 11:54 PM] Austen Milbarge | mikeyctc1#6303
Yeah, I'm farily new in here so I figured someone like you could connect with more people comfortably. I do want people like Armeanio & CW to get some if theyd like,  but understand that they may not be into providing that info. Don't want that to prevent them from getting some though.  So, That would be great. I can send a good amount out to you then! Do you want to DM me info? or how would you like to communicate  it.

We have taken community feedback to heart and decided to rethink our minting process. We are actively working on a new approach that relies on AVL trees and smart contracts to remove reliance on centralized keys. Stay tuned for more updates.

(re @HQ3rr : *Done! I would still suggest to mint your own tokens, and use these ergs as liquidity pool :)*) 
 
 I have considered it, much better option for profit probably.

However once you have "investors" behind it means that there are people paying and expecting something in return.

My project is no where close to be a perfect product, it isn't perfect, it is still very simple, not a lot of games, etc etc. I dont want people investing on something that is not a good product yet, also I could just leave anyday for whatever reason and leave those investors hanging.

The calmness that I feel since nobody is expecting anything from me is all I want at this moment, I could announce I am leaving the project for a few months anyday, and I would not feel bad for it


[03/13/2023 1:09 PM] Grand_Gambit#0000
That is how I see it, maybe in the future I will take this more seriously but atm I want to feel like I am still just having some fun and learning

 I remember you funding the reserves from your own pockets, that kind of converts it into a bussiness, but if you don't feel comfortable with a token, it's totally understandable


[03/13/2023 1:16 PM] Grand_Gambit#0000

 I‚Äôm suggesting 3-5 erg, but because of the value of erg now. It may be a good idea to put the cost in sigusd amount that way it stays consistent, when erg returns to ATH or beyond you‚Äôd have to adjust your model. 1 erg now is too cheap, but 1 erg 2025 too expensive. $5-10 seems legit for creating your own user name.


[03/13/2023 1:49 PM] AustenMilbarge#0000
Cost listed in sigusd, pay with erg.


[03/13/2023 2:29 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Ergopad does it thus way. Cost in stable, payment in either.

I am looking to Mine crypto coins with market cap under $100 mil in this Bear market:

Most known minable crypto coins like #BTC #ETC and so on are worth hundreds of millions in market cap, but what about other projects that are still minable and yet undervalued for some reason?

Seems we have a fair few things upcoming in the next few weeks which could be great timing if the price keeps up. Will create some graphics to showcase this.

The big ideas dropping this Hackaton are unreal.

Ergo ecosystem is building novel things the right way, open source with community oriented development. 

 We hear BUILD in crpyto, but it has to start on a strong foundation. 

Otherwise, its just the same shit. @Ergo_Platform

Showed my son the script and he is excited to film. Became animated and started spouting out ideas, he will be a good subject.

Located "hot gamer chick" in my geographic area. Reached out to her last night on twitch on her live stream in the comments. Fingers crossed on a collaboration there...

This is marketing group right? Nothing to do with freedom or aneta... maybe you are confused. I'm just giving my point of view and of course, you can take it or leave, no worries. ERG is like 25% of my portfolio, so I'm really interested in ERGO going to TOP10.

 yup! the only standard we can police is if they are a sigmanaut and not upholding the mission WHILE discussing or representing ERGO.

 Of course, ergo community should discuss ideas and not attack people. As sigs we will do our best to make sure to faciliate that by example.

I completely understand when the discourse goes beyond more than calling your methods out by members of the community, it's harder for you to engage within it, which isn't good for anybody. 

In short, we can do both....lets all do better to support as well as be repectifully skeptical. When shit starts flying eveyone ends up getting a little on them...

Hopefully you can keep up with the marketing updates so we can promote those tweets along with the other projects!

Not a Neta specific criticism, but it would be helpful if there was one place to hear about what is happening in the ecosystem. Mostly, I pay attention to the Wednesday dev updates. But, I have no idea what's going on with Aneta. I think the only way, at this point, is to be on Aneta's Discord/Telegram. The few times I have seen Aneta in the dev chat, it's been standard boilerplate, like:

anetaBTC

‚ÅÉ Finalizing private testnet
‚ÅÉ Testing transactions page#
- Securing backend
- Announcing public testnet date later this week/early next week

And there's weeks between updates. End result: a lot of people not spending time in your specific channels have no idea what's going on with your project. So, kind of appropriate to raise this as a marketing issue.

Seeing the messages from Ergo community asking to get listed on @krakenfx and crickets. Actually concerning that a coin like Aptos comes out of nowhere with no community but VCs balls deep and gets listed on a gazillion exchanges on T=1 but Ergo doesn‚Äôt. Centralisation baked in

I have a commitment from @katZillaax3 to work on the ErgoTv piece I've been talking about to help with onboarding and ergo wallet adoption. According to bf she's quote "on board and excited." 

They'll be in Japan for vacation till about the end of April. I'm going to Greece end of July. I am hoping to have the piece ready before I leave. There are multiple subjects I have to shoot, I'm still learning the camera, it'll be tons of editing to patch screen shares from twitch to make everything look seamless and pretty. But this may be the best piece of marketing to come out of crypto so there's that.. or it could be garbage who knows ü§∑ü§£

        Our reflexion is very early because really busy on some different changes until mid-April.
But, then we will focus on incentives for content creation.
The way we are thinking to do that at the moment is to reward content created and published more than promises of content creation‚Ä¶ 
Content could be on twitter, YouTube video, podcast, infographics, blog post‚Ä¶ 
But for the moment, we are just in an early reflexion stage. Everything can change üòÖ

        Got 1.5k views and 10comments.. before getting taken down though. Taken down for ‚Äúlow effort‚Äù content. But it‚Äôs just short and to the point. r/Cc rules are insane. Essentially everything breaks the rules but they only enforce it on posts that don‚Äôt support bigger agendas or put up by probably paying accounts or something.

@TuloErgo has been great getting some ideas together for promoting on twitter‚Ä¶ i just came across this fresh thread from the recent open sourcing of twitter code itself that will help guide Ergonauts.

Lots of interesting stuff here- dig in!

Here is exactly how your tweets are ranked

Found this in the algorithm code

The tweet's like count is the biggest impact. 30x the impact of replies.

Next is retweet count. 20x the impact of replies

Post something offensive? Tweet is dead in the water

Multiple hashtags?‚Ä¶

I plan to start a crew3 invitation event (‚Äòsprint‚Äô) after Easter, with some prizes etc. hopefully this will onboard more people and we could use this platform to boost specific Tweets as well. Right now, I have almost daily ‚ÄúTweet of the day‚Äù quest but no one really participates, except 2-5 people. You can also set what you want the user to do: follow, like, retweet and/or comment. Never used ‚Äúcomment‚Äù so much but I guess in the future I‚Äôm going to

Yes, that would be great. I still don‚Äôt know tho if the marketing for the event should start at the same time the even starts, or prior to it. So more people can make use of the invitation feature

        tbh I‚Äôve been thinking the same. If people just spam links here then some people will switch off and not check this chat. Similarily people will be less prone to sharing a link if they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ‚Äòworth‚Äô pinging everyone over. 

Could still share links here if you wanted too but might help with the noise.

My update:

Ive created a twitter for SigmaO

The UI designer Inspiredude has sent back some initial previews of the SigmaO and it looks amazing, not ready to share publicly but as we start getting more images to share I will be posting on the twitter and get some hype around the dapp

@theta_decay is also helping with some documentation for SigmaO and I will be tweeting short bits to help users better understand how the platform works cause it an be confusing at first glance

Scraped all chat convos so we could get some more detailed analytics (built in ones are pretty naff). Still tidying the data due to the bridge bot but think it could be a valuable resource. 

Sentiment over 1.2M messages in the attached image. Can filter this by channel too (Compare activity of dApps, mining sentiment, etc).

We can feed the chats into a AI chat-bot along with the docs to improve it's responses. (Maybe exclude a few channels though üòÖ)

I definitely don't have the bandwidth to run with this, but was thinking that it may be worth it to have a video series on design decisions of ergo, short, sweet, to the point, either kushti or someone familiar with:

1) Minting vs Emissions
2) POS vs POW
3) Boxes, Scripts, & Sigma Statements 

There is an animator (psychADAlias) in telegram maybe he'll want to pick it up. Or anyone here. Specifically #3 would work well with animation. I think having stuff like this may help with adoption, motivating more developers to use Ergoscript, and reassuring the curious public that we are legit. So many stupid questions in chat "ergo is scam?"

Also I'm curious to know more about all this, but taking time away from a developer who's actively developing to work on this is definitely not something urgent ATM, but may be a good idea at some point.

@trdrmorz @ergomergoadargo You say mining dosent work when it's been working and is the pride and joy of user & dev? 

90% Vote by miners ensures that users have an opportunity to veto changes brought forth by the devs. It's a more useful tool than you may realize.

PoS means only the rich get that power.

Here is exactly how your tweets are ranked

Found this in the algorithm code

The tweet's like count is the biggest impact. 30x the impact of replies.

Next is retweet count. 20x the impact of replies

Post something offensive? Tweet is dead in the water

Spitballin' trying to reach outside of our Ergo bubble on Social media... Feel free to brainstorm and suggest anything at this point. Be productive if you're going to shoot any ideas down. Offer a counter solution. This is a community thinktank, we solve issues at Ergo, not create them.

What if we crowdfunded via an NFT collection or some other community event/offering and used the revenue to take out adspace on streaming platforms such as YT, CNET,  Bitcoin Magazine and other popular resources Crypto enthusiasts visit everyday. This would extend ergo notoriety outside of social media, and branch crypto into mainstream advertising avenues


[04/11/2023 10:35 PM] wombo22#5461
@T U L O (ErgoMinnow) had the same idea to fundraise using an nft collection, was also looking for ideas on what to use the funds for


[04/11/2023 10:36 PM] wombo22#5461
idea was to throw it into a vote on what to use it for


[04/11/2023 10:38 PM] wombo22#5461
me personally, if i see crypto ads or any tbh , I ignore it but it is an idea. what sort of things did you have in mind for the ad


[04/11/2023 10:38 PM] wombo22#5461
like anything in particular you thought of that would be on an ad


[04/11/2023 10:39 PM] SigmaUTXO#3203
To add to this: We could bring in community projects to assist. Reach out to Grand Gambit and see if they want to contribute somehow, or see if other community devs would be willing to allocate a tiny percentage of revenue to assist with the funding. Run incentives to use dApps during this crowdfunding period, to incentivize users to use the ecosystem.


[04/11/2023 10:41 PM] SigmaUTXO#3203
Yeah. Less words the better. QR codes, and intelligent graphic design.


[04/11/2023 10:42 PM] SigmaUTXO#3203
We could utilize Ergo Raffle, and offer up a chance to win free Ergo merch. And utilize a percentage of the raffle revenue to go towards targeted marketing

if you also interested in receiving some, if hes still giving some away maybe reach out, can stick these around for free


[04/11/2023 10:45 PM] SigmaUTXO#3203
Im open to anything. The problem that remains is the classic echo chamber issue. How do we educate and inform about Ergo and the dev tools it offers to someone going through college, looking to get into blockchain development? That person isnt in Ergo twitter. So we have to find a way to get out of that bubble somehow.


[04/11/2023 10:54 PM] wombo22#5461
o sorry saw you were new here and had some ideas so thought you would like some stickers wasnt actually suggesting we do stickers as an avenue of advertising instead of ads


[04/11/2023 10:55 PM] wombo22#5461
but ya back to your thoughts on ads, honestly funds raising can easily be done, like I someone on reddit fund raised for ads on reddit or somewhere forgot exactly

I support a T1 Listing but thats going to be roughly $1.5 Million, and theres no guarantees that onboards new users to the ecosystem. Also, that amount of money can go alot further to address the main issue, which is spreading the word about Ergo. Problem #2 is that the US is the 2nd largest demographic of crypto investors in the world, and Ergo isnt on any main US based T1 exchanges. Its a 2 part issue with no easy answer.

        Oh Yes, these are all valid concerns and issues... who knows what will happen... and we can always vote within Ergo to decide hwo the funds are allocated... but Ideally helping toward a US based T1 would be ideal.. but we are a long way from that. we dont have anything set in stone. except a funny meme coin

Anyone heard of chainge finance? Cross chain dex. Maybe getting listed on that would help more people access Ergo


[04/12/2023 12:14 AM] wombo22#5461
you can probably ask anyone for input, probably some marketing people out here in the ecosystem but it really comes down to us as the individuals/ecosystem to take the initiative and do things ourselves/ do what we feel is right

[04/12/2023 12:34 AM] SigmaUTXO#3203
If we did go with the adspace idea, and started advertising Ergo in different avenues, Centralized exchanges would take notice, especially if its in places like YT, BTC magazine and other places. Might pressure some of them to list given the missed opportunity.

        When ever you share some dapp or critic info about ergo, add the documentation link or tag the projects, saying ... "You should check out rosenbridge" to a unknown or new comer is not best practice :)

        the faucet can do airdrops? or you mean it was a pickup?


[04/13/2023 4:13 PM] qx()#0000
maybe they just never picked it up


[04/13/2023 4:14 PM] Giufa#0000

so that it appears in the Faucet

        faucet is just a pickup, so if they never came to it and picked it up, the didn't get it.


[04/13/2023 4:23 PM] Giufa#0000
The distribution never took place 
is that what I'm supposed to understand?


[04/13/2023 4:24 PM] qx()#0000
i'm saying ErgoFaucet is a faucet, not an airdrop tool


[04/13/2023 4:24 PM] qx()#0000
if you gave ergofaucet tokens to distribute, they added them as an option for people to get, but the people need to actually go there to get them


[04/13/2023 4:25 PM] qx()#0000
like here, there are two options now

i imagine your ErgOne was an optoin at one point?


[04/13/2023 4:26 PM] qx()#0000
this is the airdop tool: https://ergoutils.org/#/airdrop


[04/13/2023 4:26 PM] Giufa#0000
The principle is that you leave your Ergo address on the Faucet and you get a whole series of tokens that are offered
We offered 50000 tokens for 5000 different addresses
It is impossible that they all sold


[04/13/2023 4:26 PM] qx()#0000
correct


[04/13/2023 4:26 PM] qx()#0000
but people need to GO to the faucet


[04/13/2023 4:26 PM] Giufa#0000
(re @dadreboi : *i'm saying ErgoFaucet is a faucet, not an aird...*)

        Yes i Know


[04/13/2023 4:27 PM] qx()#0000
so if people never went, then the 5000 people never fullly collected


[04/13/2023 4:27 PM] qx()#0000
so maybe only a small percent went, like 232 people


[04/13/2023 4:28 PM] Giufa#0000
When it's free, everyone comes to collect


[04/13/2023 4:28 PM] hq3r#0000
(re @Giufa : *When it's free, everyone comes to collect*)
        
        not always


[04/13/2023 4:29 PM] Giufa#0000
when someone enters his address on the faucet, he receives each token offered

The 5000 users have been made
it's 100% sure


[04/13/2023 4:29 PM] NoahErgo#0000
(re @Giufa : *When it's free, everyone comes to collect*)
        
        I think it isnt currently even claimable from the faucet


[04/13/2023 4:29 PM] NoahErgo#0000
even if you sent to faucet address does not mean users can claim it from the faucet


[04/13/2023 4:30 PM] NoahErgo#0000
The option to claim has to be added by devs


[04/13/2023 4:31 PM] Giufa#0000
So the developers would have kept the token for themselves?
and sold them


[04/13/2023 4:32 PM] qx()#0000
what process did you go through with the devs?
you told them to present 5k erg one tokens to anyone holding ergone?


[04/13/2023 4:32 PM] qx()#0000
and what did you say to do with the tokens that people didn't pick up?


[04/13/2023 4:33 PM] Giufa#0000
We have sent the tokens to this address

Which Cardano & Ergo wallets are 100% open-source?

No gimmicks or marketing tricks: this means we should be able to find the entire wallet code base on GitHub, audit the code, and determine seed phrases and IP address are never recorded.

No "trust me bro"

By now I have done a few round trips between Cardano and Ergo using @RosenBridge_erg and I have to say the UX is pretty fantastic

Bridging isn't even that slow, a few hours and tokens arrive

Soon we will have public test using @CometMooning and everyone can try it out!

Good evening Ergoers, it's time to talk tokens! $ERG

What tokens would you like to see listed and what market would you want to trade them against?

Token/USDT ?
Token/ERG ?

or maybe even .. 
Token/SigUSD

Let us know!

Why #Ergo DeFi is a breath of fresh air:

DeFi on Ergo just started. Sigmafi for p2p loans, Duckpools for pooled loans, and Spectrum as a DEX.

- No shady APYs for providing liquidity, (all around 0-10%) 
- All open source
- No "mysterious fees" beyond tx fees

We need battle cards against the other PoW coins. Tokenomics, emissions, and dapps. There is no other PoW coin that can compete with all 3.

Wow, @7SeasExchange, impressive. If you are so good with #Ergo, how about this idea of Exchange-native dApps? https://t.co/zWqarx5NSv

It came out before all the necessary components were fully implemented, but now they are all available:

Should we start the marketing for the Ergo 6.0 node upgrade?


[04/16/2023 2:28 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
Node upgrades are a hard market, probably better to focus on Rosen for now as that's something people can understand. Had node v6 plans actually been decided yet?


[04/16/2023 2:35 PM] panasonic#9004
That‚Äôs fair. Node 6.0 is still a long way for sure. Just thinking of a better way of promoting this upgrade since it‚Äôs a significant one. Alephium recently just had an upgrade and they were great communicating about it.


[04/16/2023 3:56 PM] glasgowm#0000
Forwarded from glasgowm: Everyone - please add any regional admins to this chat if they‚Äôre not already here. 

Need to up our regional marketing game.

Currently linear marketing (stickers, flyers, etc) are the easiest to tackle. I will collect all resources best suited and make them available somewhere. 

We should make tailored marketing approaches for each region based on their needs & culture and then push local education and awareness campaigns to pull people in.

What else can we do? Is there anywhere I/the EF could help more?

Weekly sigma

**Grand Gambit**

Soon af plinko ready to be launched, with a sexy video, lets try to break records on twitter once I post it in a few days.

Plinko will only be playable with speed pot just like in normal casinos where u deposit and play, time between each play is around 15 secs which is much more enjoyable, so far my fav game.

Same thing for the listing announcement of an ecosystem token, ready to be launched soon

The Brazilian community woke up studying #Ergo with @castacrypto . A high-level and respected fundamentalist in Brazil. More people are knowing and understanding the value of #Ergo. At this moment in the photo, he marvels at the genius of storage rent.

A single-time immutable object containing core data such as value, guard script, etc, and several registers for arbitrary use.

Still sounds pretty techy

        A box is the digital equivalent of a bank note. 

Your wallet can contain multiple bank notes (boxes). 

When you spend your crypto, you have to use at least one whole box‚Ä¶ but you can get change in the form of a new box (bank note).

One difference is that unlike a bank note, a box can be of any size, it doesn‚Äôt have to be a set amount ($5, $10, $20 etc).


[04/22/2023 8:48 AM] CW#0000
(re @bennykonan : *A box is the digital equivalent of a bank note...*)
        
        I'm thinking more along the lines of what the box contains also


[04/22/2023 9:10 AM] k0ukarin#0000
In ergo, a box contains all data and rules allowing to spend the coins/token inside whether for a simple transaction or a very complex smart contract.

        Good point. I can‚Äôt think of a good metaphor for this‚Ä¶ i guess you just say that a box can have different things in it such as tokens like xyz/abc? But a box always has a least a little bit of erg in it.

Seeing as how you can't get @Canada's premier chip flavor in The States, I enlisted the help of a fellow #Ergonaut to get these to me.

> Let's assume each NFT output takes up 200 bytes (this is a rough estimate as the actual size may vary depending on the NFT's complexity). With this assumption, you can include 480 NFT outputs in a single 96kb transaction (96,000 bytes / 200 bytes = 480).

> Now, to mint 1 million NFTs, you would require 2,083 transactions (1,000,000 / 480 = 2,083.33, rounded up to 2,083).

> As mentioned earlier, the fee per transaction is 0.0011 ERG[5]. With 2,083 transactions, the total transaction fees would be 2.2913 ERG (2,083 * 0.0011).

> For the box's minimum erg requirement, let's assume that the total size of the NFTs and other necessary data in a transaction is 96kb. With the requirement of 360 nanoerg per byte, the cost per transaction would be 34,560,000 nanoerg (96,000 * 360). Since 1 ERG equals 1,000,000,000 nanoerg, the cost per transaction in ERG is 0.03456. For 2,083 transactions, the total minimum erg requirement would be 71.98 ERG (2,083 * 0.03456).

> So, the estimated cost to mint 1 million NFTs on the protocol level would be the total transaction fees plus the minimum erg requirement for the box, which is 2.2913 ERG + 71.98 ERG = 74.2713 ERG.

Missing something? Can costs be reduced with plasma?  @MGpai probably knows)

You can only mint 1 NFT per transaction, so it would require a million transactions to mint 1 million NFTs. Plasma as used by Lillium is good for practical purposes like distributing the NFTs in as few transactions as possible, but the initial bottleneck is hard to get past.

Almost 2 years into planning & development, 13 artists, and over 20 team members later, we've almost completed all characters necessary to launch Blitz. 

A new way to play - no NFTs, just tokens with NFT qualities. No ICO, just a fair start.

Isnt it .003 to mint an NFT?

I'm not sure who is taking care of ergoplatform.org but I recommend to have a link to sigmaverse.io somewhere prominently on the landing page. I'd been in the ecosystem for awhile and had so many questions about different dapps that I didn't realize are easily answered on the sigmaverse page. I'm putting up the marketing stickers which link to ergoplatform, which is fine, good content there as well, but I don't want people to have the same issue I had.

Might be worth sharing this thread


[04/29/2023 6:49 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Probably should add to the SigmaFi Gitbook as an example and include the Ergopad API endpoint to verify the key. In this case: https://api.ergopad.io/vesting/vestedWithKey/1ca92b5e84c3d0f29bc9950954b8069ae4a96d6de15af3185d2a9622e951b7c0


[04/29/2023 6:50 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Tokenid is added to the end

(re  : *<cafebedouin> Probably should add to the Sigma...*)
        
        My guy. I just asked this question in the ergopad channel.


[04/29/2023 6:52 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I don't know what you did to get that, though


[04/29/2023 6:54 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I bought a bunch of SPF keys secondhand. That api is key for tokenjay escrow trades of Ergopad keys.
