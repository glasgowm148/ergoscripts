App build is finished, waiting for Apple AppStore to review it and publish it. In the meanwhile, I requested a TestFlight version so the ergonauts can test the app.
The code is made available for public on Github: https://github.com/ach2swift/ErgoStats

wonderful stuff guys, keep it up!!


[02/26/2023 1:28 PM] Platypus#2410
i was wondering, are you planning to expand the dashboards on ergo.watch and/or stats to include the data like on lookintobitcoin.com?


[02/26/2023 1:28 PM] Platypus#2410
or what backend stuff do we need before we can support additional on chain analytics?

I am not the developer of ergo.watch, so I could not answer to that question üôÇ My app only uses the ergo.watch api to present the data
