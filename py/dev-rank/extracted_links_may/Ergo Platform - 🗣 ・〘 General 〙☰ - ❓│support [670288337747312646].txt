[02/02/2020 7:27 PM] mrKraft#5706
I briefly checked httplib.h file, but didn't find any problem in it.


[02/02/2020 7:49 PM] mx#5165

[02/09/2020 6:33 AM] scalahub#2618

This is a feature to be implemented on frontend side


[02/09/2020 3:00 PM] scalahub#2618
@Ilya | Spectrum I think thats for inputs its not present, only outputs, while one of the inputs has R4 filled

also I can't import my wallet @ Magnum via seed because I don't know where I can find the Derivation Path


[02/11/2020 7:16 AM] mx#5165
in Magnum you click on import mnemonic phrase, then it scans all blockchains integrated with that seed, where is derivation path needed?


[02/11/2020 7:19 AM] mx#5165
and probably you will need to sync node on laptop from the start to see balance after importing seed


[02/11/2020 7:21 AM] mx#5165
in light node looks that there is some error appearing in console, maybe restart and try again


[02/11/2020 7:23 AM] mx#5165
@filippounits


[02/11/2020 7:27 AM] kushti#0978
@filippounits the wallet is not doing backwards scanning yet, unfortunately, so rescan is needed on your fullnode


[02/11/2020 7:27 AM] kushti#0978
@filippounits can you please send me lightnode logs ?


[02/11/2020 8:05 AM] filippounits#3593

@kushti @mx I will delete the .ergo folder and sync the full node again


[02/11/2020 8:09 AM] mx#5165

but if they don't do rescan it will rather doesn`t show anything either


[02/11/2020 8:13 AM] mx#5165
so these wallets are basically only useful at the moment when you are creating new wallet


[02/11/2020 8:14 AM] mx#5165
there is no rescan functionality yet like in Bitcoin


[02/11/2020 11:43 AM] kushti#0978
@mx Magnum is interacting with explorer, which is collecting data for all the addresses so no rescan is needed

(my last problem is still with HotBit)


[02/11/2020 7:35 PM] mx#5165
so you just used the main scan correct without any path?


[02/11/2020 7:36 PM] filippounits#3593
cause I've set olso the mnem psw, when I've put the seed, I've put the mnem psw also


[02/11/2020 7:36 PM] filippounits#3593
also*


[02/11/2020 7:36 PM] filippounits#3593
correct, without any path

[02/11/2020 7:38 PM] filippounits#3593

@kushti Where are the log files kept by default with version 3.2.1, it used to be in the same directory with previous versions. I am trying to investigate a strange issue with the node, it seems to accept duplicate block submission for a PoW with the same block header.


[02/28/2020 9:23 PM] kushti#0978
@BigEvilSoloMiner the simplest solution would be to run a node with 

java -jar  -Dlogback.stdout.level=DEBUG ergo-3.2.1.jar --mainnet -c mainnet.conf 

and then console output will contain (a lot) of DEBUG-level messages

send logs to me please if looks like a bug indeed

Does anyone know what might cause a full node to not stay syncd with the mainnet?  I have a node that is stuck at `full height` of 107279 when the actual value when I go to the mainnet browser is something like 192000.  Is there a way to kick a node to get syncd up with the mainnet short of deleting the wallet and history and doing a wallet restore and a full resync?


[03/30/2020 8:17 AM] Steele Lau [UTC+8]#8407

@Bauhaus911 well,as discussed in PMs, your problem is about corrupted database (on 32-bit platform), so yes, deleting everything (but wallet/keystore and wallet/storage folders if you want to store your keys) is needed


[04/01/2020 9:22 AM] kushti#0978

just put the seed (and the mnem psw if exist) without entering the path

@Cheng Wang and if you remove "/wallet" folder , then full blockchain rescan is needed currently.

[06/03/2020 6:55 PM] mx#5165
miner`s config should look similar to this


[06/03/2020 6:55 PM] mx#5165
{
  "mnemonic": "xxx xxx xxx",
  "node": "http://127.0.0.1:9053",
  "keepPrehash": true
}


[06/03/2020 6:56 PM] mx#5165
if there was mnemonic pass used during wallet creation, it needs to be added


[06/03/2020 6:59 PM] mx#5165
hopefully you have at least few hundred GPUs to mine with, looks like incoming pools will have more optimized miners integrated


[06/03/2020 7:00 PM] Draeth | $ARRR/$NLIFE/BPSAA#3300
na, just messin around with 1 gpu


[06/03/2020 7:00 PM] Draeth | $ARRR/$NLIFE/BPSAA#3300
now it's saying generated and received public keys don't match


[06/03/2020 7:02 PM] scalahub#2618
ok that is a much better error 🙂


[06/03/2020 7:02 PM] mx#5165
if you don`t remember if you used mnemonic pass during wallet init, then try to delete wallet folder, restart and create wallet again, otherwise you will need to add mnemonicpass line  to miner's config


[06/03/2020 7:04 PM] mx#5165
it will be also needed for example if you would like to import wallet in Magnum


[06/03/2020 7:27 PM] Draeth | $ARRR/$NLIFE/BPSAA#3300
...it looks like its working!


[06/03/2020 7:28 PM] Draeth | $ARRR/$NLIFE/BPSAA#3300

[06/03/2020 7:30 PM] Draeth | $ARRR/$NLIFE/BPSAA#3300
one last question. How is the network hashrate so crazy high?!


[06/03/2020 7:32 PM] mx#5165
looks like there are some memory hard flaws found by industrial miners(so they may have like ~x4 advantage now) but they vote to fix them so still hashrate is coming by my opinion from GPUs and not necessarily will change much after fix


[06/03/2020 7:35 PM] mx#5165
most hashrate increase from ~1 to now ~6 TH/s in last months is coming from competition between two big guys as for my looking


[06/03/2020 7:35 PM] mx#5165
for long time there was almost 0 competition


[06/03/2020 7:38 PM] mx#5165
small miners were knocked out basically day by day from the start


[06/03/2020 7:43 PM] mx#5165
after changes looks like Ergo has chance to support mostly GPUs community only, should be unique again then,  including enabling competition of GPUs with these https://www.ospreymining.io/product-page/ecu50

Node web panel says everything is ok but the node keep saying "zero modifiers to download" or something like that


[07/29/2020 5:07 PM] ponte#8953
And show that error very often


[07/29/2020 5:10 PM] ponte#8953
I have to mention that this pc is in another house and if there's power outage it reboots automatically and load a bat file to start the node


[07/29/2020 5:11 PM] ponte#8953
So probably the node had a violent shutdown due to power loss of the pc (it happens time to time)


[07/30/2020 3:35 PM] kushti#0978
@ponte looks like corrupted database


[07/30/2020 3:35 PM] kushti#0978
maybe we can try to repair it in future versions

Hello.  I'm running a node on Win10; since changing from 3.2.7 to 3.3.0 my ERG balance for my wallet address is reported as zero.  However, the same address on the explorer confirms the balance is there.


[08/10/2020 9:54 PM] weistanbo#6812
I have tried deleting the application and wallet, state, history and .ergo files with no luck.  Can someone help me fix this issue?


[08/10/2020 9:55 PM] weistanbo#6812
(after deleting, reinstalled and resynced wallet, with no success)


[08/10/2020 10:00 PM] weistanbo#6812
Have also queried Swagger w/wallet transaction IDs and this is the result: {
  "error": 404,
  "reason": "not-found",
  "detail": null
}


[08/10/2020 10:01 PM] weistanbo#6812
This is despite the fact my node interface shows the wallet address with the transaction ID associated on explorer


[08/10/2020 10:04 PM] Robert K#0722
@weistanbo This probably isn't the case, but are you running any dApp that registers UTXO-set scans?


[08/10/2020 10:04 PM] Robert K#0722
Because scans take precedent over the wallet, and so you won't see the boxes/funds in the wallet if they do get picked up.


[08/10/2020 10:11 PM] weistanbo#6812
No, no dApp


[08/10/2020 10:14 PM] Robert K#0722
Did you restore the wallet with your mnemonic?


[08/10/2020 10:15 PM] weistanbo#6812
Yes


[08/10/2020 10:15 PM] Robert K#0722
I believe the db formats between 3.2.X and 3.3.0 are different


[08/10/2020 10:16 PM] Robert K#0722
Hmmm, the only thing I can suggest then would be to delete your `.ergo/wallet/registry` folder, which will rescan the blockchain from blockheight 0.


[08/10/2020 10:16 PM] Robert K#0722
(Do this after you restored your mnemonic with your node)


[08/10/2020 10:16 PM] weistanbo#6812
Ok, I will try this


[08/10/2020 10:16 PM] weistanbo#6812
Appreciate your help


[08/10/2020 10:20 PM] kushti#0978
@weistanbo please delete .ergo/wallet/registry, also, after starting the node do wallet unlock - lock - unlock please (if you had only one address in your wallet, otherwise, unlock would be enough). the node will convert keys into a news format then and rescan the wallet


[08/10/2020 10:29 PM] weistanbo#6812
Ok I will try this as well


[08/10/2020 10:42 PM] weistanbo#6812
Have deleted wallet/registry and currently rescanning from restored mnemonic.  Also have done unlock-lock-unlock.  Will update w/results.  Thank you for your time


[08/10/2020 10:45 PM] kushti#0978
rescan should be pretty fast


[08/11/2020 3:27 AM] weistanbo#6812

Hey, I followed the guide to run a full node and everything is working well.


[08/13/2020 11:56 AM] Rolf Sneikmann#2090
but everytime I restart I have to reinitialize wallet from mnemonic phrase, is there any better way to do it ?

with wallet password, not mnemonic

@Rolf Sneikmann you can remove wallet.secretStorage.secretDir = "C:/Users/rolfs/Documents/ERGO/ergo_folder" actually


[08/13/2020 12:40 PM] kushti#0978

[09/02/2020 6:41 PM] filippounits#3593
1 tx with 0 Round have "queued" status than say "Transaction is being generated", the other tx have 7 Rounds, "running" status than say "Transaction is being generated"


[09/02/2020 6:45 PM] anon2020a#8187
That is weird. If you DM me your log file then I can investigate.


[09/02/2020 6:45 PM] filippounits#3593

Hi, I'm following the tutorial on the Ergo website in order to install the native wallet as I would like to get involved, buy some coins, and then not hold them on a CEX. 
Win10 user. 
I'm at a part where I've been instructed to run  `java -jar ergo-<release>.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf` in powershell, however when I do I get the following result

I'm not sure what to do, can anyone point me in the right direction so I can buy coins and not have to store them on an exchange?

@Narrator you must install Java


[09/10/2020 8:12 AM] Narrator#2693
hmmm I did install Java, I guess I'll give the comp a restart?


[09/10/2020 8:13 AM] scalahub#2618
Does the command 'java' on its own work? Can you try and paste the output


[09/10/2020 8:14 AM] Narrator#2693

I used the top one


[09/10/2020 8:14 AM] scalahub#2618
Maybe try outside powershell?


[09/10/2020 8:15 AM] Narrator#2693
hmmm what does that mean 'outside powershell?'


[09/10/2020 8:16 AM] scalahub#2618
Run 'cmd' first and then in the window that opens what does typing 'java' output?


[09/10/2020 8:18 AM] Narrator#2693
Just did a restart before running it

Please read the above.
Before reading, you can try the following command to see if it works `"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-14\bin\java" -jar ergo-3.3.1.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf`

[09/10/2020 3:03 PM] Narrator#2693
Thank you.  
For the 'before reading try this part' is that in my CMD line or powershell?


[09/10/2020 3:04 PM] scalahub#2618
try in `cmd` after entering the `c:\ergo` folder


[09/10/2020 4:46 PM] ponte#8953
@Narrator hi, did u manage to get java work?


[09/10/2020 6:04 PM] Narrator#2693
@ponte I just finished with my tasks I was buried in and am going back to start trying where I left off yesterday.  I'll let you know within the hour


[09/10/2020 6:11 PM] ponte#8953
@Narrator within the hour i'll be driving but i'll get back as soon as i get home!


[09/11/2020 12:22 AM] Narrator#2693
@ponte  I haven't been able to get it to work after trying the previous instructions and suggestions listed here.


[09/11/2020 12:22 AM] Narrator#2693
I've been attempting to read up on the various elements (I unfortunately only was able to get started about an hour ago) and can't seem to find out what's wrong


[09/11/2020 8:12 AM] ponte#8953
@Narrator the issue is still with java? if so we can try to declare system variables for windows. maybe better start with a fresh installation of java?


[09/11/2020 8:21 AM] ponte#8953
@Narrator go to "control panel" -> "programs" -> "uninstall a program" and uninstall Oracle Java than reboot your pc


[09/11/2020 12:19 PM] Narrator#2693
@ponte for clarity of what I'm doing the only uninstall that I can target concerning Java is - Java(TM) SE Development Kit 14.0.2 (64-bit)  Is that what we're after


[09/11/2020 12:19 PM] Narrator#2693
I'll be around for the day now and will watch for replies to try to get this solved.   Ty for your help, idk why this is such an issue atm


[09/11/2020 12:20 PM] ponte#8953
@Narrator let's try to declare variables without unistalling java


[09/11/2020 12:21 PM] ponte#8953
use "find" and write in there "system variables" it should appear: "edit the system environment variables" click that


[09/11/2020 12:22 PM] ponte#8953
on the window it will appear you may look for "environment variables..." down right


[09/11/2020 12:22 PM] Narrator#2693
ok I'm there


[09/11/2020 12:23 PM] Narrator#2693
This part is familiar from a tut I think I went through so I have 2 variables populated already leading to jdk-14.0.2, and I'll do them again


[09/11/2020 12:24 PM] ponte#8953
make sure u set the path in system variables leading to the bin folder in jdk-14.0.2 ecc


[09/11/2020 12:24 PM] Narrator#2693
What is displayed is 2 boxes, one is for system variables, one is for user variables.  Both are for Environmental variables


[09/11/2020 12:24 PM] Narrator#2693
Making a new one now.


[09/11/2020 12:25 PM] ponte#8953
okay, did u point to the /bin folder inside java folder?


[09/11/2020 12:25 PM] Narrator#2693
Does it matter what I enter for the variable name?  Or is that arbitrary?


[09/11/2020 12:25 PM] ponte#8953
eheh don't know, just put java in there BUT


[09/11/2020 12:25 PM] ponte#8953
in system variables you should see a variable called PATH


[09/11/2020 12:26 PM] Narrator#2693
this is my path, i used the browse directory... button to get there


[09/11/2020 12:26 PM] Narrator#2693
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-14.0.2\bin


[09/11/2020 12:26 PM] ponte#8953
oh


[09/11/2020 12:27 PM] ponte#8953
so try to close cmd and open a command prompt again


[09/11/2020 12:28 PM] Narrator#2693
ok which command am I running to check for java?


[09/11/2020 12:28 PM] Narrator#2693
`"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-14\bin\java" -jar ergo-3.3.1.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf`


[09/11/2020 12:28 PM] ponte#8953
is here you put the java bin folder, right?

[09/11/2020 12:30 PM] ponte#8953
as you see there is already a "path" variable, the path to java folder should be added IN there,


[09/11/2020 12:30 PM] ponte#8953
so you click "path"


[09/11/2020 12:31 PM] ponte#8953
"edit"


[09/11/2020 12:31 PM] ponte#8953
"new" than u can browse to the java/bin folder


[09/11/2020 12:31 PM] Narrator#2693
oh


[09/11/2020 12:32 PM] Narrator#2693
that's where my PuTTY path and stuff is stored, this kind of makes more sense.  I apologize for not understanding faster.


[09/11/2020 12:32 PM] Narrator#2693
I should really be using linux and getting away from win10 shouldn't I?


[09/11/2020 12:32 PM] ponte#8953
eheh no problem mate, it was the same for me


[09/11/2020 12:33 PM] ponte#8953
you can keep both 🙂 i love linux even i'm not a super mega powerful user


[09/11/2020 12:33 PM] Narrator#2693
ok i've added the path to `\bin`


[09/11/2020 12:34 PM] ponte#8953
ok, close CMD open a new one and finger crossed

[09/11/2020 12:41 PM] ponte#8953
cool, so now you can try running the ergo node jar file


[09/11/2020 12:43 PM] ponte#8953
so you move with cmd to your ergo folder


[09/11/2020 12:43 PM] ponte#8953
mine is c:\users\ema (that's me)\ergo


[09/11/2020 12:44 PM] ponte#8953
in that folder you should have put the ergo-3.3.2.jar file AND the ergo.conf configuration file

here's my output


[09/11/2020 12:46 PM] Narrator#2693
and it generated a ergo.log file in the ergo folder


[09/11/2020 12:46 PM] Narrator#2693
i can go back and do it from cmd if you'd rather


[09/11/2020 12:47 PM] ponte#8953
not sure, but let's keep it running for the moment and now you can go check the node panel at "http:\\127.0.0.1\theportyouchose in ergo.config


[09/11/2020 12:48 PM] ponte#8953
like mine is port 9052, so the node panel is "127.0.0.1:9052


[09/11/2020 12:48 PM] Narrator#2693
how do I identify port?


[09/11/2020 12:48 PM] ponte#8953
oh, this has to be wrote in a browser


[09/11/2020 12:48 PM] Narrator#2693
right


[09/11/2020 12:48 PM] ponte#8953
the port is up to you, in the ergo.conf file it should be specified


[09/11/2020 12:49 PM] Narrator#2693
I should prob pick back up with the tutorial I didn't get that far to enter the port in the conf


[09/11/2020 12:49 PM] ponte#8953
perfect!


[09/11/2020 12:49 PM] ponte#8953

no problem!


[09/11/2020 12:57 PM] Narrator#2693
I saw the recent 3.3.2 release.  When this occurs do I just replace the .jar file and run the `java -jar ergo-<release>.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf` cmd again to initialize it?


[09/11/2020 1:06 PM] ponte#8953
well some versions require you to delete the /wallet/registry subfolder


[09/11/2020 1:07 PM] ponte#8953
btw when a new version is relased usually there are information to how to migrate from precedent, as you can see in 3.3.2

Same here got failed transaction when I withdraw my ergs to my yoroi wallet. I was using Coinex Exchange

Hi guys, pretty simple question I hope


[10/09/2020 12:33 PM] Nick [ᴏʟᴇᴜᴍ]#2333
Is there a way to restore my old account (I have the seed) to a new wallet on yoroi extension


[10/09/2020 12:34 PM] Nick [ᴏʟᴇᴜᴍ]#2333
or sounding like maybe hold off using yoroi for a bit?


[10/09/2020 12:35 PM] Cyphrym#6140
Already sent support ticket to Coinex Exchange they said something about node issue.

[10/09/2020 12:36 PM] Nick [ᴏʟᴇᴜᴍ]#2333
Its just a while since I installed node/wallet and I often delete everything and just save seeds


[10/09/2020 12:36 PM] Nick [ᴏʟᴇᴜᴍ]#2333
do I have to reinstall/synch a node to get my ERG to the yoroi?


[10/09/2020 12:37 PM] Nick [ᴏʟᴇᴜᴍ]#2333
or can I use the seed?


[10/09/2020 12:47 PM] Robert K#0722
The mnemonic you have from the ergo node is using an old scheme which means you'll need to restore it in a node.


[10/09/2020 12:47 PM] Robert K#0722
In the next Ergo node update the default for the full node will be the same as Yoroi, and they will be interoperable.


[10/09/2020 12:50 PM] Cyphrym#6140
> In the next Ergo node update the default for the full node will be the same as Yoroi, and they will be interoperable.
@Robert K So does this mean that is why we have a failed tx since Yoroi node and Ergo node are not the same at the moment?


[10/09/2020 12:51 PM] Robert K#0722
No, that is entirely a different issue and unfortunately I am unsure why.


[10/09/2020 12:51 PM] Robert K#0722
Those comments were just about wallets/mnemonics.

i was not able to build my miner based on the setup guide so i found a github link and downloaded a pre-set miner (AutolykosGPUWin64binary-master)

@kushti  Nothing coming out for me either on ergo explorer and it has been more than 48 hours since I withdrawn my ERGs from Coinex. This is what Coinex gave me as my tx id -> https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/e85b5c309b625da5214ddf8c5649d419ed724f3b439bc52a2c330bd5bcc3fc2c , Is it true that "withdrawal had been delayed due to the instability issue of the official node" ?, that's what they told me.


[10/11/2020 8:11 PM] kushti#0978
@Cyphrym a combination of issues, including one with the node it seems. Most of withdrawals are okay, but few are failing. Can be fixed on their side solely before a fix in the node. Talking with them.

Hi. I do not think that my miner is mining correctly. Based  on the FAQ rom ergopool.io my miner should have an output of 
{
 "msg": "...",
 "pk": "...",
 "pb": "...",
 "b": "..."
}

Currently my miner is showing

{
 "msg": "...",
 "pk": "...",
 "b": "..."
}


[10/15/2020 10:53 PM] Bene#2546
what do i need to do to get the "pb" to be produced by the miner


[10/16/2020 8:32 AM] kushti#0978
@Bene are you mining with ergopool ?


[10/16/2020 8:37 AM] Bene#2546
I'm not sure. In my config file, I have the localhost and the port number. Was I supposed to have the ergo pool link?


[10/16/2020 8:38 AM] Bene#2546
I don't think I'm mining with ergopool

@kushti 

> No, miner need to get `pb` for send share to proxy


[10/16/2020 10:18 AM] kushti#0978
@Bene if you're doing solo pb is not needed then


[10/16/2020 12:40 PM] Bene#2546
Okay but I'm not seeing any shares. Valid or invalid. I followed all of the guides provided. The only guide that was different was the one on the ergopool.io where there is a step to setup a proxy


[10/16/2020 12:42 PM] Bene#2546
Is setting up a proxy required or can I just have a full node and miner running? @kushti


[10/16/2020 12:42 PM] kushti#0978
@Bene yes, but then you're mining with ergopool?


[10/16/2020 12:43 PM] Bene#2546
I want to mine with ergopool. I'm just not sure how to connect to the pool


[10/16/2020 12:55 PM] zargarzadehmoein#2928
> I want to mine with ergopool. I'm just not sure how to connect to the pool
@Bene 
Oh, I thought you want solo mining

for mine with ergopool, you need set up the proxy between your node and miner, for this using this (https://ergopool.io/how/)

I've a question: why if the mempool have more than 50 tx waiting for to be confirmed, miners does not include any transaction in new blocks? the only tx that they include is the coinbase and i.e. in the last 3 blocks 0 tx where processed, just the coinbase.

[11/14/2020 10:33 PM] mmahut#8044
@kushti ah, thank you, I missed this, I assumed without the flag it will do testnet as in monero, do you plan to have a testnet that is public in the future?


[11/14/2020 10:35 PM] kushti#0978
@mmahut it was until recently, now as we're testing new PoW, there were few new testnets in short period of time, so new network magic bytes were introduced for them (so your peer can't connect to testnet now without config modification and using code from non-master branch)


[11/14/2020 10:35 PM] kushti#0978
We don't have resources atm to support few testnets in paraleel (


[11/14/2020 10:37 PM] mmahut#8044
no worries, I will use mainnet, I'm trying to write integration tests for ergo yoroi backends and I have seen the testnet is just a fraction of the mainnet so hoped for a quick sync from scratch, but I work around it with a snapshot, thank you!

I've been mining for about a week at ~50 MH/s.  In what timeframe might I see a mining reward? I ask not because I need ERG. I just need final confirmation that I am actually **mining** ERG (even though Robert Kornacki commented that my terminal session looked good).


[11/25/2020 1:56 PM] kushti#0978
@claven many months, so better to join a pool after the HF coming


[11/25/2020 1:56 PM] kushti#0978
if you want rewards


[11/25/2020 1:56 PM] kushti#0978

[11/25/2020 1:57 PM] claven#9099

[11/25/2020 2:00 PM] kushti#0978
@claven yes, definitely!


[11/25/2020 2:00 PM] Robert K#0722
After the HF in the next month or two, you'll get a much better chance with pools coming into the ring


[11/25/2020 2:01 PM] claven#9099
Well, recent ADA price movement will support the electricity for POW. 🙂


[11/25/2020 2:04 PM] claven#9099
Final question: Does a GPU with 50 MH/s support the network just as much as a GPU with, say 5 MH/s? If yes, I'll spin up a lower power-consuming machine and use the high end graphics card for World of Tanks.


[11/25/2020 2:05 PM] kushti#0978
@claven support from 50MH/s is 10x of 5MH/s 🙂

hello, is there a way to see the current block header that my node is syncing during active synchronization?


[01/20/2021 5:23 AM] masonjar#4454
polling the /info page on the rest API shows NULL for all the block header entries


[01/20/2021 9:23 AM] kushti#0978
@masonjar "headersHeight" in /info


[01/20/2021 5:18 PM] masonjar#4454
thanks, i guess i had an issue with my storage because after i deleted and restarted sync, i was able to see the block height.


[01/20/2021 5:20 PM] masonjar#4454
however, now i am having trouble with the mining software, any ideas?

Hey I withdrew some ERG off of CoinEx about an hour ago, it hasn’t hit my wallet yet and when I check the TXID ergo explorer shows “Transaction with this ID was not found, or it has not entered Mempool yet”. CoinEx is showing the withdrawal as confirmed. Not sure what to do from here, any insight?

[01/27/2021 4:59 PM] kushti#0978
@Sutton | aeriolabs.xyz they are using its own transaction assembly procedure, and it is not flawless, so sometimes invalid transactions being generated. I proposed a fix few months ago and thought it was applied but it is not. Please ask support to resend transaction. I am now pushing  them to fix the things finally. Hopefully this week will be finally fixed.

Hello,
I'm trying to install the Nvidia miner following this guide: https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_05_07_mining/ with no success.
I follow the steps until to build the libcurl, but after I execute the cmd "nmake /f Makefile.vc mode=dll MACHINE=x64" I dont get the build at the Curl directory, \curl\builds\libcurl-vc-x64-release-dll-ipv6-sspi-winssl\bin  but instead I get the directory "curl\builds\libcurl-vc-x64-release-dll-ipv6-sspi-schannel" and then when trying to build the miner nothing happens.

[02/08/2021 7:01 PM] PA-Joe#6163
I'm a newbie to mining ERG..  I mostly mine ETH in mining pools.  I like the Idea of having my own node, but I'm thinking it might be too hard for me to understand how to actually mine ERG without a mining pool.  Thanks for your help


[02/08/2021 7:04 PM] Robert K#0722
Mining without a pool will be challenging unless you have a very large hashrate


[02/08/2021 7:04 PM] Robert K#0722
Using pools is also easier to setup, so best stick with that until you poke around and get used to the ergo node for now

[02/08/2021 7:20 PM] Robert K#0722
You don't have to, but yeah you can set it to false. Syncing should take 3-4 hours max if you have a good internet connection and not the worst cpu on earth.


[02/08/2021 7:20 PM] Robert K#0722
In your terminal does it show you are syncing? (Does it update the block height)


[02/08/2021 7:21 PM] kushti#0978

[02/08/2021 7:23 PM] kushti#0978

height is not moving?


[02/08/2021 11:30 PM] Robert K#0722
Has the best block ID changed? (And is it continuing to change over time?)


[02/10/2021 2:28 PM] PA-Joe#6163
NO 😩


[02/10/2021 2:32 PM] Robert K#0722
Sounds like something broke. Maybe the history got corrupted if you shut it off abruptly by mistake?


[02/10/2021 2:32 PM] Robert K#0722
Try syncing a node from 0 once again (make sure you have your mnemonic saved and handy before deleting anything)


[02/10/2021 2:33 PM] Robert K#0722
Or as I said previously, you can just use Yoroi alternatively to get a working wallet without much extra work


[02/10/2021 4:42 PM] PA-Joe#6163
I was able to restore my wallet to a Yoroi ERG wallet.  Thanks.  It's showing the correct amount of ERG in the Yoroi wallet.  I should be good to go to delete my ergo folder and start over?  Well, not delete, I will just rename the old ergo folder in case I need a file later?


[02/10/2021 4:54 PM] Robert K#0722
Yes you should be fine with deleting/renaming.


[02/10/2021 4:54 PM] Robert K#0722
Your funds are safe as long as you have your mnemonic.

Not sure if I've done something daft, I was liquidating some shtcoins into erg and went to withdraw - got the address from yoroi-web and withdrew via Hotbit. It didnt appear so I assumed it'd maybe just take a few hours due to the difficulty. 

The withdrawal is now showing as complete on Hotbit, but when I go to Yoroi mobile, that address isn't there, I have a `9fp...` and a `9em...` but no `9ehe...` - I've double checked my CoinEx and Hotbit logs, is there anywhere else I could've sent it? It's not in any of my erg wallets and that's the only two exchanges I'm on that take erg 

Address: 9ehaY3eBJLUqQAeCfzsPhWVHJ1KFoSGLP86FSzS4yPhZgDeXN4s

Txid: 49ea3fa520fb3a6cdc9ab536910aa2c5cbb91354e455f469a5b28589a57df9d5

You should be able to find your ergo.log and send that to kushti as he mentioned


[02/11/2021 3:42 PM] Robert K#0722
Your node is acting a bit odd and we need logs to figure out what's wrong


[02/11/2021 3:44 PM] Robert K#0722
That is pretty unfortunate @glasgowm. Not sure if there's really anything that is possible to do at this point if they were somehow sent to the wrong address.


[02/11/2021 3:44 PM] Robert K#0722
Maybe asking Hotbit support if you didn't enter that address and have no idea what it is?


[02/11/2021 3:52 PM] glasgowm#9381
Found them! I had accidentally sent them to my friend. Don't know how I manage it

not sure directories in config are corresponding to windows format. Are you getting "Bad API Key" error when unlocking API in 127.0.0.1:9053/panel maybe ?


[02/11/2021 6:05 PM] PA-Joe#6163
No, API key works fine.  No Errors.


[02/11/2021 6:07 PM] PA-Joe#6163
The folder structure is there in windows. The key is in the folder listed in the config file. It was incrementing fine and then just stopped. This is the second time too. Although this time it got further.  Hmmm, 3rd times a charm? 😆

hello all -- I've created my first Ergo wallet in Yoroi and sent 10 ERG to it from CoinEx... CoinEx says the tx is complete, the tx currently has 80 confirmations, my receiving address on the explorer says it has the 10 ERG in it, but Yoroi says zero and no transactions... I've re-synced several times, and even removed and restored my wallet (and re-verified my receiving address is still the same, etc...) -- any help would be appreciated...

Hello all, I've started my local node today after some time off (~2 days) and synchronization is taking forever, but the most strange is that whenever I try to enter my api key I get a "Bad API Key".

Hmm, you have two options:
- create the NFT again based on the procedure and ignore the first one
- You can start the auction with your yoroi wallet. So yoroi sends tokens around with 0.01 ERG. In the auction house, you have to set the initial bid in a way that the final amount that it asks you to send along with NFT would be 0.01 ERG


[02/19/2021 7:35 AM] anon_real#2768
Does the second approach makes sense to you?


[02/19/2021 7:36 AM] anon_real#2768
Ah, initial bid must be at least 0.1 ERG )


[02/19/2021 7:38 AM] anon_real#2768
So what you have to do is to send two transactions. let's say you set initial bid to 1 ERG then you first have to send your NFT to the provided address (which contains also 0.01 ERG) and send another transaction to fill the remaining ERGs which would be 1.001 in case of 1 ERG initial bid.


[02/19/2021 8:29 AM] anon_real#2768
So what was your initial bid? and how much did you send in the second tx?


[02/19/2021 8:31 AM] anon_real#2768
Yes, a looot of txs in mempool.


[02/19/2021 8:31 AM] anon_real#2768
You should have sent 5.001 in second tx since 0.01 was sent with you NFT


[02/19/2021 8:31 AM] anon_real#2768
So the sum would be 5.002


[02/19/2021 8:32 AM] anon_real#2768
So you should wait for your funds to be returned to you (


[02/19/2021 8:33 AM] anon_real#2768
No problem.


[02/19/2021 8:33 AM] anon_real#2768
Sorry I was wrong. So if you want 5 ERG as initial bid, send 4.992 ERG in second tx (5.002 - 0.01)

[02/19/2021 12:25 PM] anon_real#2768

hi there! i got my node ver 4.0.7 running and synced, but my wallet was showing less balance than it was supposed to show, so i did via swagger a wallet rescan, now the wallet says "active synchronization" but it's like 24 hours and wallet shows 0 balance, should i remove wallet directory or...


[02/20/2021 12:22 PM] ponte#8953
ups sorry just noticed that node says synced but it's not on the same height


[02/20/2021 12:22 PM] ponte#8953
i'll try to reverse to 4.0.4


[02/20/2021 12:27 PM] ponte#8953
yeah, so 4.0.4 show "synced" state but it's on the wrong height... what do you suggest? full resync? 😭


[02/20/2021 1:19 PM] anon_real#2768
My nodes had this issue this morning too


[02/20/2021 1:20 PM] anon_real#2768
I had no chance but to resync (


[02/20/2021 1:21 PM] ponte#8953
@anon_real  will do that, thanks!


[02/20/2021 1:53 PM] ponte#8953
Now I started to sync node but my wallet address is different from the one I got before... Did it couple of times to be sure I restored the wallet with correct mnemonic...


[02/20/2021 1:53 PM] ponte#8953
I deleted whole .ergo folder


[02/20/2021 1:55 PM] ponte#8953
Well I renamed it. Than I tried to put Wallet folder into the new .ergo folder created by the node but the address shown it's still different from the original one


[02/20/2021 2:31 PM] anon_real#2768
I think your address (wallet folder) was created before 3.3.4
Maybe try to add ```ergo.wallet.usePreEip3Derivation = true``` to your config file (after removing wallet again) and run the node.


[02/20/2021 2:33 PM] ponte#8953
I managed to have addresses back putting back the whole folder, renamed just state and history folder and restarting the node


[02/20/2021 2:34 PM] ponte#8953
Yes, it's surely before 3.3.4 ... Next time will try preEip3derivation or maybe if I don't see balance after resync )

They are pending. I am told to send more tokens to help speed up the process, I send 2 more ergo, they arrive, but nothing happens. If I send the total amount pending 251, the process begins but the same amount remains in the mixer. A never ending loop.

@petabyteHD  @MiV  I don't know if not having an API key worked in earlier versions, but I know that 4.0.7 gave me a lot of issues when doing that (I imagine people who upgraded already had the API key so it isn't mentioned  as much).

I used https://toolkitbay.com/tkb/tool/BLAKE2b_256 (credits to @kushti ) to generate a string,hash(string) to be able to create an API key.

You probably could go with a version like 4.0.4, but it'd be annoying to update if you can just generate key the aforementioned way.

I've had the transaction fail and had to try again multiple times. I think it happens if the price of ERG changes but I'm not sure.


[02/28/2021 10:01 AM] KushGene#1429
Hey 🙂
Im using sigmausd.io and had bought some SigRSV with ERG yesterday. So lets say the amount was 1000. Now I bought some more SigRSV with ERG, lets say 500. So my new RSV balance should be 1500 or not?

The problem is, that my balance only shows the 500 (switched from the 1000 to 500). I believe its a virtual bug, but just want to mention and to be sure, that it is only a bug ^^


[02/28/2021 10:03 AM] anon_real#2768
@KushGene Maybe they are in different addresses. UI only shows for the address you have set for your wallet.


[02/28/2021 10:04 AM] KushGene#1429
The thing is, that the wallet showed the first amount all the time. I didnt changed the wallet, just bought new and now the new balance is showed instead of old+new.

Also, the purchase history is still there showing the right things (2 txs)


[02/28/2021 10:04 AM] anon_real#2768
@KushGene Yoroi can potentially move your tokens to other change addresses.


[02/28/2021 10:05 AM] KushGene#1429
Just checked the receiver address on both the RSV txs, both wallet adresses are the same.

I gave it 4 cores to run on, because it was not liking 2 cores while synching

That might explain why my node VM crashes. Only allocated 4GB of ram, and 4 cores. The node crashes after a bit.

[03/01/2021 11:41 AM] anon_real#2768
@ponte Something unexpected has happened. Assembler will return your funds in a few hours when these kinds of rare things happen.
No need to wait for assembler to send refund though. You can use the following url to make asembler send your refund anytime your want (can even work if you want to cancel your request before it is done):
```https://assm.sigmausd.io/return/user_address_set_in_ui/address_funds_sent_to```


[03/01/2021 11:41 AM] anon_real#2768
Please let me know in DM if you have difficulties using the url


[03/01/2021 11:43 AM] ponte#8953
thanks anon_real! do i understand well: user address is my yoroi address set in the sigmausd.io page


[03/01/2021 11:44 AM] anon_real#2768
yes because refund can only be sent to that address


[03/01/2021 11:44 AM] ponte#8953
address funds set to is the address generated by sigmausd.io to send usd from yoroi, right?


[03/01/2021 11:44 AM] anon_real#2768
right


[03/01/2021 11:45 AM] ponte#8953
thanks,  i'll try! how did that happened? )


[03/01/2021 11:47 AM] anon_real#2768

It could be a system issue on my end as well. Not entirely sure. May set my node up on one of my rack servers

[03/01/2021 4:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just sold my ASIC yesterday and shipped it out today, so I’ve got a little more money to toss into this.


[03/01/2021 4:57 PM] Kardall#4142
Ya we are contemplating running a miner on a server we run two other applications on. But i'm not sure it's a good idea. It has a 1070 on it, so it would work. I just wanted to figure out if there was a way to modify the miner for nVidia to limit the GPU usage to like 80% maybe.


[03/01/2021 4:58 PM] Kardall#4142
Unfortunately I don't have an nVidia GPU myself, so I can't test it


[03/01/2021 4:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, I’m curious how these K80’s will act using CUDA, myself.


[03/01/2021 4:58 PM] Kardall#4142
That and i'm not a C++ programmer lol


[03/01/2021 4:58 PM] Kardall#4142
I can work my way around the code a little, but I don't understand a lot of the syntax.

Yeah same here


[03/01/2021 4:59 PM] Kardall#4142
I did see that the AMD one has loglevel support somehow, but it's not really clear how to enable it in the config.


[03/01/2021 5:00 PM] Kardall#4142
My next step is to try to build the node from scratch, and see if I can work on that to get it so I can change the way it logs myself.


[03/01/2021 5:00 PM] Kardall#4142
Having a 1.3gb log file is annoying


[03/01/2021 5:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, I considered seeing if Linux handled the miner any differently, on a dedicated machine. I liked the idea of running a node on a raspberry pie though, for efficiency purposes


[03/01/2021 5:14 PM] Kardall#4142
That's why my friend wants to do.


[03/01/2021 5:15 PM] Kardall#4142
He'd rather buy $1000 worth of pi's and run it that way.


[03/01/2021 5:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just make a cluster node. Doubt 1000 dollars worth of pi’s would pay for itself quickly enough to justify the process


[03/01/2021 5:16 PM] Kardall#4142
ya, he's just saying, rather than buy a GPU to put in an old machine 🙂


[03/01/2021 5:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
I feel ya. The increased cost of GPU’s sorta makes me happy that I’ve hoarded the handful of GPU’s I have laying around. Need to try one more time to revive this other 580 ive got. I don’t have high hopes for it though


[03/01/2021 5:19 PM] Kardall#4142
I have an RX 470 in a box when I got m 5700XT. I was going to use that, but I don't have a rig to put it on now LOL

this was done an hour ago, tx appears in the blockchain tracker


[03/01/2021 9:03 PM] Mfer Ikerio#8567

@Mfer Ikerio is it in the explorer? https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/addresses/9fs99SejQxDjnjwrZ13YMZZ3fwMEVXFewpWWj63nMhZ6zDf2gif their withdrawals

it's been like 2 hours now


[03/01/2021 9:58 PM] Mfer Ikerio#8567
and I want to place an ergoauction but it says that my wallet has no funds


[03/01/2021 10:15 PM] kushti#0978
then the problem is in the wallet, what is your wallet ?


[03/01/2021 10:36 PM] Mfer Ikerio#8567
could it be that my node is yet in an active synchronization state?


[03/01/2021 10:37 PM] Mfer Ikerio#8567
I mean, I set up my wallet like 2 weeks ago, I don't get why my node isn't synchd yet lol

Hi there 👋 I'm trying to follow this tutorial for starting a node: https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_02_how_to_setup/, but when I run `java -jar ergo-4.0.7.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf` I get this response:

You need to set the "hello" hash they give you as an example to get it running, then change it.

[03/02/2021 12:00 AM] Mfer Ikerio#8567
it has to include the "" too

Does that get set in the `conf` file or via the command line?

It somehow seems like a more elaborated version fo the ergo.conf shown in the tutorials but I can't find any documentation on it somehow....


[03/03/2021 11:09 PM] kushti#0978
@wunderbaer [Hermes Stakepool] this config is rewriting some values from reference.conf (in the same folder), and there're comments there


[03/03/2021 11:22 PM] kushti#0978
Guys I've realized that some of you are running nodes (on Windows , following some tutorial, I guess) with directory = "c:/ergo" and secretDir = "c:/ergo" , and then wallet is not initialized after restart.

The problem is that the node assumes that the secret dir contains only one file (encrypted seed). Likely you have many JSON files in the secretDir folder. 
4.0.8 will be permissive to multiple files in secretDir. For versions we have now, copy JSON file(any of them if you used the same mnemonic) to a dedicated secretDir containing one JSON file only!

so the blog post came out after I purchased SigUSD, is it required to redeem all sigusd and sigrsv?


[03/05/2021 1:27 AM] kcconnected#6828
I saw a blog post saying we need to redeem all SigUSD and SigRSV because a whale was gaming the contract.  Is this true and what is the timeline for redemption?

How do I redeem my sigRSV? 
From the site https://sigmausd.io/#/
It gives me a wallet address to send my sigmaRSV when I try to redeem for ERG, how do I even send my sigRSV to that wallet address?


[03/05/2021 5:56 AM] anon_real#2768
Please DM me your wallet address to send refund


[03/05/2021 5:56 AM] anon_real#2768
Using Yoroi. Just select the token instead of ERG in "Send" tab


[03/05/2021 5:57 AM] Fourieristic Fr໐ງ#6571
I got it, thanks!


[03/05/2021 1:34 PM] Rich#6507
I tried to redeem my SigRSV using the Ergo node interface.  I sent the SigmaRSV using the "Assets" checkbox on the wallet but now I'm showing 0 balance for SigmaRSV in my account and no Erg to replace it?  Is there some sort of lag I should be aware of?


[03/05/2021 1:35 PM] Rich#6507
I believe this is the transaction, but I can't figure out how to tell where the SigmaRSV was attached: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/8febfa55c5243bfbc21d3f51156a20c0e38ce82ec0bdf8aec490afde35c8ef5f

If it matters, I'm running version 4.0.7.


[03/05/2021 2:07 PM] anon_real#2768
@Rich You should have set 0..01 ERG for the asset. You have sent it with 0.001 ERG


[03/05/2021 2:07 PM] anon_real#2768
So DM me your address to send you refund and then you can do it again with 0.01 ERG

As I understand I should start StratumProxy and connect miners to it. In StratumProxy

Not sure if anyone has seen the message in the #deleted-channel channel but there are a few people over on Telegram starting to get anxious as well about transactions seeming to be frozen from the perspective of the Explorer. Just wanted to bring it up here for visibility.

Does anyone know why my node is crashing randomly while syncing? I've almost got it fully synced, but it's crashed like 10 times with this error:

@kushti Perhaps you have ran into this before?

@$aX do you run it with -Xmx flag ?


[03/25/2021 7:39 AM] kushti#0978
e.g. java -jar -Xmx3G  ergo-4.0.8.jar  --mainnet -c mainnet.conf


[03/25/2021 7:39 AM] kushti#0978
please do that

@kushti I have plenty of memory available, but I can try that


[03/25/2021 6:33 PM] kushti#0978
@$aX it's JVM garbage collector issue on some platforms, please try the flag


[03/25/2021 6:40 PM] $aX#5658
@kushti It appears to have solved the issue, thank you!


[03/25/2021 6:40 PM] $aX#5658
Would it be worth trying -Xmx4G on an 8GB RAM system?


[03/25/2021 6:41 PM] $aX#5658
Or would there be no improvement in sync time with that


[03/25/2021 8:14 PM] kidamoianlicci#1768
@kushti  is everything all right with the Yoroi wallet and how it interacts with Ergo, any known issues currently?

[03/26/2021 4:32 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
The auction house doesn’t need to connect to your wallet, because you enter your wallet address in the auction house “Configure Wallet” pop up, and then have to send money from that wallet to confirm your bids; so any ergo wallet should work, including Yoroi...
That said, there’s not many right now...(see photo)

Hello , little problem there


[03/29/2021 10:04 PM] viler#2164
I try to get SigRSV transaction is ok ERG sent but i dont have sigRSV and no ERG 😄

[03/29/2021 10:06 PM] cymatic#8185
So the transaction looks like it was successful? Do you see it showing as successful on the "History" area of the sigmausd.io page?


[03/29/2021 10:08 PM] viler#2164
This is try after that. First was 100k SigRSV

Did you send to node wallet or Yoroi?


[03/29/2021 10:24 PM] viler#2164
I sent from Yoroi to generated adress from https://sigmausd.io/#/reservecoin. Second time i try just 6ERG and it work but somehow first 117 sent "somewhere"


[03/29/2021 10:29 PM] cymatic#8185
So the ERGs are missing from Yoroi, the history on sigmausd.io is showing as green, but you don't see the SigRSV in the "Select asset" dropdown on the "Send" tab of your Yoroi wallet?


[03/29/2021 10:32 PM] viler#2164
Nop there is no history on sigmausd.io about this transfer and ERGS are missing in yoroi


[03/29/2021 10:35 PM] cymatic#8185
And you know the address you sent your ERGs to is correct as you "copied" it from the sigmausd.io site? (by clicking the link that places the address on your clipboard)


[03/29/2021 10:35 PM] viler#2164
Yes Im 100% sure that i did it right.


[03/29/2021 10:37 PM] cymatic#8185
Okay, it currently only has 48 confirmations...might just need to wait until it has "high" level of confirmation to see the Tx fully completed. But I can't guarantee that. If I remember correctly, it seemed like once I got above 200-250 confirmations that my Tx's were "final"


[03/29/2021 11:02 PM] viler#2164
So its solved, probably im good

wallets are the basis for every interaction. Please don't use just one server for important apps. 

Try using decentralized Servers that cannot go down due to high usage or be hacked/ddos. maybe just 0.1% of cryptoland knows Ergo. And yet you have such problems.What happens after you become a big name?

 Try Prepare now for later.
You are building all decentralized stuff but when it comes to core internet you stick with centralized inefficient models.

The Internet makes everything work, if internet connections get bad, everything else fails.  

There are already products that decentralize websites,apps,cloud,servers,DNS.

Look into services like **twitter.com/Syntropynet**  to never experience server slow downs or app outages

Or look at FLUX as decentralized server alternative for running apps, **twitter.com/RunOnFlux**

These decentralized services are also **cheaper**. So business wise nice benefit. Work with your blockchain peers. Take this hint not just for your wallets but for any of your app infrastructure:D  @Sebastien

No I mean: I have 250 EUR which I put in a ATM to have xx BTC or ETH on a private wallet (Ledger). How do I get ERG from there?

I’m hoping someone can help me recover my SigmaRSV. I made a redeeming attempt and was instructed to send SigmaRSV to a specified long address. I sent it from the Ergo node wallet, and I have yet to receive my ERGs back. Furthermore, the sigmausd.io UI does not show the redemption in its history, and the SigRSVs are gone. Would really appreciate any help right now, thanks


[04/14/2021 3:39 AM] JKleinne#7947
I think I see why, SigRSV redeem addresses start with yWW, I think I sent SigRSV to the SigUSD redeem address


[04/14/2021 3:39 AM] JKleinne#7947
Is there any way I can recover it?


[04/14/2021 3:51 AM] Dergler#0451
couple things to check, when did you try doing this? the current sigmausd.io is new contract, so check the v1 contract by scrolling to bottom and clicking v1. your wallet's history only shows for the connected wallet, is there a chance that you switched public addresses that you were using?


[04/14/2021 3:54 AM] JKleinne#7947
Tried it not almost an hour ago and I’m positive it’s the V2 contract and it also has the correct wallet address. I have the address and the transaction that took place, but I realized I sent SigRSV to a SigUSD redemption address. I can see the SigRSV still within that address however, I was hoping for a transaction refund like what happens when minting fails but so far nothing yet


[04/14/2021 3:55 AM] JKleinne#7947
Also tried https://assm.sigmausd.io/return/your_address_set_in_ui/the_long_address_you_sent_to


[04/14/2021 3:55 AM] JKleinne#7947
but would respond `requirement failed: Minimal ERG value not met`


[04/14/2021 4:04 AM] Dergler#0451
hmm. that's all i could offer, sorry.

the message is when amount is too tiny


[04/14/2021 10:25 PM] JKleinne#7947
it's solved, thanks to Glasgow and anon. I sent SigRSV to proxy with node, so I was sending 0.001 instead of 0.01 so I couldn't get the refund. I sent some ERG a few times to the address but would instantly get returned to me giving me no window to execute https://assm.sigmausd.io/return/your_address_set_in_ui/the_long_address_you_sent_to . After a few more tries sending 0.01 ERG to the proxy address, I was able to get the refund

{Reactions}
👍 

[04/14/2021 10:30 PM] JKleinne#7947
Basically, the address didn't have enough balance in ERG (the one I initially sent was 0.001 ERG) to create a transaction to return my SigRSV and it was not retaining any ERG I sent but was returning them immediately. For some reason, it did retain the latest send and I was able to initiate the refund


[04/15/2021 4:40 PM] glasgowm#9381
anon has ping dimitry to fix, but in the meantime ^

SigmaUSD.io is showing incorrect balances for me after a couple failed transactions. History is correct but "your balance" and the banner up top values are incorrect. What really matters is what Yoroi shows after confirmation, right?

Hi guys, Im new to Ergo and am trying to understand it more, but I notice it is quite technical for me. So I was wondering: 
- What are you guys most excited about to come to Ergo the coming months?
- Has there been an increase in (unique) developer engagement? Is there a way for me to track such a metric?


[04/23/2021 5:04 PM] glasgowm#9381
- ErgoDEX probably
- Yes - no formal way to track it, you can see how many people kushti has tagged each week in #🛠│development but probably not the most accurate metric

What do I have to do to get the latest block?

It seems using reverting back to 4.0.9 from 4.0.10 has fixed most of my issuse


[04/30/2021 5:12 PM] pragmaxim#0778
did it get stuck with `ergo-4.0.10-beta.jar` but not with `ergo-4.0.9.jar` @The Gamerzs ?


[05/01/2021 9:40 PM] kushti#0978
hmm lemme check 4.0.10 carefully before the release @pragmaxim @The Gamerzs

I used cache as I thought lower it would lower the amounts stored in mem


[05/03/2021 11:04 AM] kushti#0978
yeah, but we had raspy node with 512 MB RAM given @The Gamerzs

Its working atm (Like it was before), will update soon if it breaks mid way applying new modifiers

So its already got stuck on `block 11264`


[05/03/2021 11:31 AM] The Gamerzs#9062
It seems to stop and start applying modifiers every 5-10 minutes


[05/04/2021 10:57 AM] The Gamerzs#9062

(or any size you like and the machine has ram)


[05/07/2021 4:15 PM] The Gamerzs#9062
512Mb

Thats what I asked him, but you responded

Yeah, because I did not believe some would try it with so little memory - sorry 😉


[05/07/2021 4:28 PM] essaias#5787
You could try -Xmx350m to limit it to 350MB RAM (if the PI has that much available)


[05/07/2021 4:28 PM] The Gamerzs#9062
Its fine, Its the only reason why i'm still trying


[05/07/2021 4:29 PM] essaias#5787
If you set it too low performance on java processes usually degrades.

It seems to work but then stops after x hours

Even when I had limeted it
I'll still try that arg tho


[05/07/2021 11:15 PM] kushti#0978
please run with -Xmx flag, e.g. -Xmx512m , but we haven't tried smaller values, and you need to leave some RAM for OS. Try -Xmx384m maybe

Hello!
I’m having a problem with my node wallet. The API key is entered successfully but when I go to unlock the wallet UI I get and error : tag mismatch . Also previously had issues with the wallet not displaying the correct amount of Erg on the front end. Will deleting and restoring the wallet be my best bet at fixing this?


[05/12/2021 5:52 PM] Armeanio#0321
The is a major delay  due to tech team personnel change. That is all I know for now when there is an estimate I will let you know.

ntroducing SigmaUSD.io the first UTxO-based stable coin - an instantiation of the AgeUSD protocol. The foundation on which a new era of digital finance will be built.

Its economic model designed in partnership between IOHK, Ergo, and Emurgo maintains the conservative settings for collateral reserves and avoids the need for liquidations. Along with that, it supports a fully decentralised stablecoin emission setup. Thus, SigmaUSD will offer the world a stable, simple, and decentralised stablecoin.

use-cases
- Accepted in cryptocurrencycheckout 
- Mix SigUSD or SigRSV in ErgoMixer, the first non-custodial, non-interactive miner in the cryptocurrency space.

Troubleshooting:
Transactions can fail when the oracle refreshes during (and the price changes). In this event the funds will be returned to your connected wallet. 

Use this link for a refund anytime if your funds become 'stuck' in a proxy address:  https://assm.sigmausd.io/return/your_address_set_in_ui/the_long_address_you_sent_to

Notes:
- Do not use "send all assets" option in Yoroi! It will send sigUSD and sigRSV in addition to ERG.
- There is a large stakeholder with SigUSD (the 'Bearwhale') - see the latest updates here - https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-05-13-bearwhale-saga/

Does the Airdrop on ergoutils have any requirements or limitations? I can't get it to let me airdrop some tokens


[05/13/2021 11:46 PM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
It's giving the error "Could not contact the assembler service"

Is this comment related to my issue?

Is it possible to create tokens built on Ergo platform like it is on BSC and ERC20 networks?


[05/14/2021 4:33 AM] Kaven#6681
believe so, yes, but i'm not official support


[05/14/2021 4:33 AM] Kaven#6681
google ergoscript github or something like that


[05/14/2021 4:34 AM] Kaven#6681
hey question for anyone that knows, if i'm running a node can i call /wallet/init and create more wallets?


[05/14/2021 4:34 AM] Kaven#6681
basically i want to have a hodling wallet and then one for transactions and what not


[05/14/2021 4:34 AM] Kaven#6681
dont want to be sending out the one that holds the balance


[05/14/2021 6:43 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
I was told you might have some insights about how ergoUtils.orgs' airdrops works? I can't get it to contact the assembler service when I try to use it. 
I read there was some kind of gatekeeping that needed to done for it.. but wasn't sure if that was still the case.

Just for learning purposes: 
- how hard would it be to set up a smart contract and oracle (pool?) that evaluates Covid number and vaccine numbers of different Austrian regions (available as open data series) and that assigns (minimal) amounts of ERG to the virtual wallets of each region (9) based on a weighted indicator? 
- is it possible to set up for a non- tech person like me with only some python knowledge? 
- or would it be more of a „leave it to the devs“ thing?
- Thanks in advance

I think there might be some problem with the ERG withdrawal on hotbit side again. I tried to withdraw my ERG from there and it says completed on app and theres a txid but when I check on the txid on the ergo explorer, It doesn't recognize it. It has been a while now.


[05/14/2021 4:37 PM] darkarcz#0603
sent a ticket to hotbit to check as well but they haven't gotten back. A little bit worried of my ERG which is currently stuck in limbo

[05/15/2021 1:10 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
@anon_real The Airdrop is working again! thank you!

I've never used it before, do I need to send two transactions to the given address if I'm trying to send out a bunch of SFT? 
or can I use Yoroi to add multiple tokens per transaction?... or do I need to do something else... 

If anyone else knows this or has experience with the ErgoUtils Airdrop PLEASE Help!

It doesn't seem to work when sent separately... took about 15 minutes and then refunded everything :linksad:


[05/15/2021 2:15 AM] Sid#0001
Hey folks, loving the looks of this project. Is Ergo listed on any swap/exchange tools? For example uniswap?


[05/15/2021 2:48 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
Ergo is currently not listed on a swap. ErgoDex is supposed to launch soon and that would be the gateway


[05/15/2021 2:49 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
currently it's only on a few centralized exchanges


[05/15/2021 2:50 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
CoinEx, Gate.io, Waves.exchange (is that decentralize? haven't used it), Hotbit.io and TradeOrge


[05/15/2021 2:52 AM] Sid#0001
Sounds good, I'll stick to gate.io for now.


[05/15/2021 2:52 AM] Sid#0001
Made an account on there just to buy ergo.


[05/15/2021 2:53 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
It's pretty amazing how much ERGO is growing in price considering how it's not the easiest to acquire for the common investor 🙂 Looking forward to the DEX 🙂 

Good luck!


[05/15/2021 2:57 AM] Sid#0001
Thank bud, loving this coin so far. Stuck my 800mh/s on it and pulled all my rigs off of ETH. Still holding onto my ETH bag of course, but excited to diversify into something that's so progressive with the tech, and will be a safe haven to miners with 2.0, as well as solves the scalability issues with ETH. And has some ADA magic blended in.


[05/15/2021 3:00 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
😄 I was actually doing the math on my ETH rig today 😄 now that ERG has jumped up, I might also make the swap 😄 

ERG is definitely doing it right! for the right reasons! Looking forward to seeing where we can take it from here! 🧑‍🚀


[05/15/2021 3:01 AM] Sid#0001
I'm glad I'm in now! Going to see some great gains once 2.0 rolls out, and it gets listed on more exchanges. It's a good hedge to protect current eth holdings.


[05/15/2021 3:08 AM] Sid#0001
I mean, even at current profitability, it's not far off from what I'd be making on Eth. So long as it's not listed on whattomine it should be solid prime time mining.

Considering a security measure was compromised and no one was actually impacted(afaik), and they seemed to have been be pretty up front about it. 
Sucks but I think they did a good job handling it.

Gate.io won't let you withdraw until they verify your identity, with your drivers license and whatnot. Still pending my verification. Scared to hold onto almost 2k worth of ergo in there. Prefer it in my own wallet.


[05/15/2021 10:25 PM] Lion#6963
they don't let you send to any other wallet??

hi i dont undertand sigrsv issue and bearwhale announcements, i hold erg, do i need to be helping with a problem somehow?


[05/17/2021 12:39 AM] andee#4722
If you hold sigrsv, claim profit. if you only hold erg there is nothing you can help with @Kaven


[05/17/2021 12:41 AM] Kaven#6681
i see. wanted to make sure there wasnt some kind of emergency or something. thanks.


[05/17/2021 12:41 AM] andee#4722

[05/17/2021 12:42 AM] Kaven#6681
yes i read once, i'll read again. thank you.


[05/17/2021 12:42 AM] Kaven#6681
andee, do you know if node alone can hold multiple wallets, or do i need to run ergomixer or some other dapp or tool to set up more wallet addresses?


[05/17/2021 12:42 AM] Kaven#6681
basically i need a solution for transacting more privately in public


[05/17/2021 12:42 AM] Kaven#6681
compiling ergomixer now, but wondering if i'm overthinking it


[05/17/2021 12:48 AM] andee#4722
@Kaven I haven't tried the mixer yet, but its whole purpose is to hide the origin of the coins so I am pretty sure you won't need separate wallets. Its on my research list 🙂


[05/17/2021 12:50 AM] Kaven#6681
yeah i'm just looking for the recommended solution for transacting in public, ergo and custom tokens, in a private way, e.g. multiple wallets


[05/17/2021 12:53 AM] andee#4722
I think the way it works is that you send coins to the mixer, when they are ready to withdraw you just input the address you want them transferred to


[05/17/2021 12:54 AM] andee#4722
no need for a separate wallet. But of course you can use one of your other wallets as output address


[05/17/2021 12:54 AM] Kaven#6681
so i'm less talking about breaking link between my funds and recipient, but more about, i just need transactional wallets that dont hold my entire reserve/balance


[05/17/2021 12:54 AM] Kaven#6681
yeah its the 'one of my other wallets' part i'm wondering about


[05/17/2021 12:54 AM] Kaven#6681
what other wallets?


[05/17/2021 12:54 AM] Kaven#6681
i set up the full node, i get 1 wallet


[05/17/2021 12:54 AM] Kaven#6681
how do i get more


[05/17/2021 12:56 AM] andee#4722
cant you just use yoroi? seems simpler, no?


[05/17/2021 12:57 AM] Kaven#6681
i would, only problem is it apparently cannot accept custom tokens, only ada and erg


[05/17/2021 12:58 AM] Kaven#6681
i mean ideally i could get on the ergo panel and spin up some extra addresses, but i dont see this


[05/17/2021 12:58 AM] Kaven#6681
i see in the swagger ui there is a /wallet/init endpoint but


[05/17/2021 12:58 AM] Kaven#6681
i dont know if this is the answer


[05/17/2021 1:00 AM] andee#4722
keep different config files for the different wallets, run the node with the config of the wallet you want?


[05/17/2021 1:00 AM] Kaven#6681
hmm


[05/17/2021 1:01 AM] Kaven#6681
looking into this..


[05/17/2021 1:02 AM] Kaven#6681
the only configurable value i see in the conf is scorex { restApi { apiKeyHash } }


[05/17/2021 1:02 AM] Kaven#6681
well anyway, i'll look into your suggestion more, thanks


[05/17/2021 1:05 AM] andee#4722
thats a hash of the secret you initialize the wallet with


[05/17/2021 1:05 AM] andee#4722
I don't know if you have to edit any of the others things, if running another config will overwrite something. I haven't setup a node yet, too much on TODO list


[05/17/2021 5:02 AM] SUPERSOLDIER97x#7653
Yeah i've been looking on how to create more addresses but can't seem to figure it out using the node


[05/17/2021 5:14 AM] dns963#4838
hello, how can i redeem old sigrsv?


[05/17/2021 5:32 AM] Kaven#6681
@SUPERSOLDIER97x let me know if you find out


[05/17/2021 1:38 PM] T R A X E N#7277
How can I convert my ERG to BTC I want to use p4ay.com to cashout?


[05/17/2021 2:38 PM] $aX#5658
@SUPERSOLDIER97x @Kaven You can create new addresses from the Swagger API within the wallet


[05/17/2021 2:39 PM] $aX#5658
/wallet/deriveNextKey


[05/17/2021 2:46 PM] SUPERSOLDIER97x#7653
I'll try that out


[05/17/2021 2:50 PM] SUPERSOLDIER97x#7653
do i need to be synced for that to work


[05/17/2021 3:00 PM] SUPERSOLDIER97x#7653
I got it work after my node was synced


[05/17/2021 4:30 PM] Kaven#6681
bless you


[05/17/2021 4:30 PM] Kaven#6681
🙏


[05/17/2021 4:30 PM] Kaven#6681
i will try this now


[05/17/2021 4:30 PM] Kaven#6681
imo there should be ui controls for this in the panel btw


[05/17/2021 4:32 PM] andee#4722
@Kaven Weren't you after separate wallets, not addresses?


[05/17/2021 4:41 PM] Kaven#6681
whats the diff


[05/17/2021 4:48 PM] andee#4722
separate wallets have different seeds


[05/17/2021 4:48 PM] andee#4722
one wallet can have many addresses


[05/17/2021 4:49 PM] Kaven#6681
can the wallet be derived from the result of 'deriveNextKey' return value


[05/17/2021 4:49 PM] Kaven#6681
my goal is privacy


[05/17/2021 4:57 PM] Kaven#6681
i know daedalus gives you a bunch of keys for your cardano wallet but then warns that the wallet can be derived from these additional keys and not to rely on them for privacy


[05/17/2021 4:59 PM] andee#4722
I would like to know the answer to this aswell


[05/17/2021 4:59 PM] andee#4722
No point in mixing from address 1 to address 2 if its possible to link the addresses to the same wallet


[05/17/2021 5:27 PM] Kaven#6681
@SUPERSOLDIER97x would you happen to know the answer to this?


[05/17/2021 5:27 PM] Kaven#6681
i'll search for documentation on it


[05/17/2021 5:28 PM] Kaven#6681
for how big of a project and community this is, this discord is pretty sleepy :/


[05/17/2021 5:31 PM] andee#4722
they have a lot on the roadmap and limited resources


[05/17/2021 5:44 PM] Kaven#6681
yeah just sayin'


[05/17/2021 5:44 PM] Kaven#6681
it is what it is


[05/17/2021 6:03 PM] SUPERSOLDIER97x#7653
what was your  question


[05/17/2021 6:05 PM] Kaven#6681
alright so say i run a full node. i get a wallet with that. now i want to transact in public without flashing my wallet/full balance around. if i call /wallet/deriveNextKey my understanding is this isnt a separate wallet per se, but another hash that points to the same wallet. would this hash be private? or could a 3rd party derive my wallet from it? the latter is the case with daedalus/cardano which warns you the additional keys are not private and wallet can be derived from them.


[05/17/2021 6:08 PM] SUPERSOLDIER97x#7653
as I understand it address generation is supposed to be a one way process. You can still track that address but not any others generated by the same key


[05/17/2021 6:08 PM] SUPERSOLDIER97x#7653
otherwise people could not only track your entire balance but also steal your funds


[05/17/2021 6:08 PM] Kaven#6681
its kind of an important topic. i think users would like to know their main wallet is private like they know their bank account is private. i need to find some documentation on this, but i'm not seeing any.


[05/17/2021 6:09 PM] Kaven#6681
if anyone from ergo team devs/ergonauts could chime in that would be helpful


[05/17/2021 6:15 PM] SUPERSOLDIER97x#7653
its important to remember that this is a public blockchain


[05/17/2021 6:23 PM] andee#4722
@SUPERSOLDIER97x Cardano addresses are possible to link to each other, to know that they belong to the same wallet even though they have never transferred funds between each other, that's the question


[05/17/2021 6:24 PM] andee#4722
if it is possible to do the same with ergo, because then it would be useless to mix from address 1 in wallet to address 2, since they can be linked just by knowing the addresses


[05/17/2021 6:25 PM] andee#4722
then would have to create a new wallet to mix the coins to, so the addresses are not possible to link to wallet 1


[05/17/2021 6:25 PM] SUPERSOLDIER97x#7653
I think that this would require an answer from the devs


[05/17/2021 6:30 PM] Kaven#6681
okay. so with the privacy-enabling features of ergo being a major highlight of the platform, we should put any documentation on using those features at the forefront. people are flocking to ergo NOW and are going to want to start using it. as a user, i would like to know how addresses/wallets are related such that i can maintain a reasonable level of privacy when transacting in public. thanks.


[05/17/2021 6:31 PM] andee#4722
@anon2020s  seems knowledgeable and active, though idle now 😦


[05/17/2021 6:31 PM] SUPERSOLDIER97x#7653
I agree. Its also important to note that the mixer was created by someone who is not affiliated with the foundation


[05/17/2021 6:33 PM] andee#4722
its anon2020s


[05/17/2021 6:33 PM] andee#4722
and glasgow I think

Anyone else who has experienced nanominer just stopping out of nowhere with no errors either?


[05/17/2021 6:56 PM] andee#4722
unless you take it in the #⛏│mining channel, I would recommend nanopool support


[05/17/2021 6:56 PM] andee#4722
if you have weird problems like that, just change miner


[05/17/2021 7:03 PM] Chrissp#8275
tried already but it drowned haha, it has only happened to me once 😒 (ran for 19 hours before it happened)


[05/17/2021 7:31 PM] Kaven#6681
is the whole ergo team east of UTC? anyone available in USA timezones for support? should i try back late evening pacific time?

restart your node if you have problems connecting @LimpinAintEZ


[05/17/2021 8:09 PM] LimpinAintEZ#9161
Ok, thanks for checking for me!


[05/17/2021 8:10 PM] andee#4722
haha.. the node runs locally on your computer


[05/17/2021 8:11 PM] andee#4722
so if you have problems connecting, the problem will be at your end


[05/17/2021 8:19 PM] LimpinAintEZ#9161

[05/17/2021 8:25 PM] andee#4722
just join a pool


[05/17/2021 8:25 PM] andee#4722
unless thats GH 🤣


[05/17/2021 8:26 PM] LimpinAintEZ#9161
it's not, lol


[05/17/2021 8:27 PM] LimpinAintEZ#9161
i was trying to get a feel for ergo before bringing 1428mh/s in rigs over. still pool with tose you think?


[05/17/2021 8:27 PM] LimpinAintEZ#9161
those*


[05/17/2021 8:27 PM] andee#4722
I would use herominers or woolypooly


[05/17/2021 8:28 PM] andee#4722
I have 1GH, no way I am soloing


[05/17/2021 8:28 PM] LimpinAintEZ#9161
Ok, cool


[05/17/2021 8:28 PM] LimpinAintEZ#9161
And then I dont have to run a node? lfg


[05/17/2021 8:29 PM] andee#4722
no, the pool does


[05/17/2021 8:29 PM] LimpinAintEZ#9161
Ok, coo. ergoplatform site made it seem ike pools and asics were out, solo mining only


[05/17/2021 8:30 PM] andee#4722
they should have updated information 🤔


[05/17/2021 8:30 PM] andee#4722
but that was from before autolykos2


[05/17/2021 8:31 PM] andee#4722
someone found a way to pool mine using smart contracts, so ergo team changed it so everyone could

Youre an angel my friend. I found the updated info. I have no Idea how I landed on an old info page (#1 maybe?)...but we are on track now. Thank you so much!


[05/17/2021 8:34 PM] andee#4722
happy to help! you can thank me by not using nanopool, they have over 50% of the networks hashrate


[05/17/2021 8:35 PM] LimpinAintEZ#9161
I'm on sparkpool right now for ether. gonna try HM and WP based of your recommendation!


[05/17/2021 8:35 PM] andee#4722
😃 👍


[05/17/2021 8:36 PM] andee#4722
remember the difficulty is variable, so the shares wont be constant. you can set a static diff if you want though


[05/17/2021 8:53 PM] kranebitt#0334
Just wanted to ask if maybe you had any update regarding BitMart exchange? I am more and more convinced that it is not a scam just wanting too much at the same time. But nit fixing Ergo makes me upset 😅


[05/17/2021 8:54 PM] Armeanio#0321
I'll ping them again sorry buddy. Last I heard it was a tech/dev issue.


[05/17/2021 8:55 PM] kranebitt#0334
I‘ll get over it but can‘t wait for my ERGs to be safe on my wallet again 😅


[05/17/2021 8:55 PM] kranebitt#0334

[05/17/2021 8:55 PM] Armeanio#0321

i get the bad API key even tho i have
-so far carefully followed the github page on "Set up a full node"
-used the swagger ui with multiple "secrets" to get the hash, that have been pasted in ergo.conf
-wrote the "secret" on the panel set api with and without quotes multiple times
my ergo.conf looks like the one in the screenshot (hash replaced by placeholder for obvious reason)

Is there a good tool to check my latency to some of the pool addresses?


[05/17/2021 11:21 PM] zumarius#3832
And do the pools basically end up with more or less the same profit.


[05/17/2021 11:21 PM] zumarius#3832
I see most have a 0.9% fee


[05/17/2021 11:25 PM] andee#4722
@nnneb did you input the hash, then restart the node?


[05/17/2021 11:25 PM] nnneb#3659
yes


[05/17/2021 11:26 PM] andee#4722
@zumarius this belongs in #⛏│mining though. just use ping ?


[05/17/2021 11:26 PM] andee#4722
@nnneb are you trying to authenticate the wallet?


[05/17/2021 11:27 PM] nnneb#3659
i am trying to set api


[05/17/2021 11:27 PM] nnneb#3659
it is the first time i use ergo platform


[05/17/2021 11:28 PM] andee#4722
are you using the hash or the secret to authenticate?


[05/17/2021 11:28 PM] nnneb#3659
i am using the secret


[05/17/2021 11:28 PM] nnneb#3659
the hash goes in ergo.conf


[05/17/2021 11:29 PM] andee#4722
do you have spaces in the secret?


[05/17/2021 11:29 PM] nnneb#3659
the latter one i used does


[05/17/2021 11:30 PM] nnneb#3659
should i use _ these or no spaces at all


[05/17/2021 11:31 PM] andee#4722
I dont really know, but try quoting "this is my secret"


[05/17/2021 11:33 PM] nnneb#3659
well now the utility failed to load


[05/17/2021 11:34 PM] andee#4722
just authenticate


[05/17/2021 11:35 PM] andee#4722
no need to hash it again

[05/18/2021 12:35 AM] andee#4722
If it doesn't work there either, something is wrong with how you set things up. I only authorized on that page before, thats why I asked you to test there


[05/18/2021 12:37 AM] nnneb#3659

Hey Ergo team, I am a video maker, crypto investor and Cardano bull. I just recently saw your video competition on Youtube.... is there any way you can extend the deadline and I will make a kick ass video explaining everything about Ergo. For a look at some of my previous videos check out my YT channel - The Daily Millennial. I've made some on blockchain and Charles Hoskinson previously.

@RuruPT I seriously doubt that they are willing to pay binance for a listing


[05/18/2021 1:36 PM] RuruPT#2996
binance would increase coin value


[05/18/2021 1:40 PM] andee#4722
and so will other listings


[05/18/2021 1:42 PM] andee#4722
they are trying to make a great product, not pump the price


[05/18/2021 1:42 PM] andee#4722
price increases now, without binance


[05/18/2021 2:24 PM] RuruPT#2996
It's not about pumping price, it's about getting in reach to everyone. Me personally, i don't know those exchanges as i've only entrusted binance as my exchange.

[05/19/2021 9:03 AM] glasgowm#9381
Looks like it makes a new wallet - more if you search for `deriveNextKey`


[05/19/2021 9:03 AM] glasgowm#9381
Their deposits have been slow/patchy the past few days.


[05/19/2021 9:05 AM] carlin#9836
So long as it goes through. They upped their ADA withdrawal limit to 500 and now this. I'm surely calling quits on CoinEx now.

Hi all. I have a friend who was mining Ergo for a while, and Yoroi broke under so much small inputs. Unfortunately, he does not have mnemonics, but we extracted private key. 
How can we access funds (that is not via Yoroi), with private key (no mnemonics) at hand?

@glasgowm so /wallet/deriveNextKey just generates more wallets for the same node? are these public keys linked in anyway? like could a third party derive the other wallets using it, or if they had 2 public keys could they verify they're from the same node or that they are linked?

my hash and my secret match perfectly in Swagger. When I go to "set API key" I get "bad API key" the hash in my config file is the same as the output hash from Swagger.

thats wack, so my pc sucks i guess


[05/20/2021 12:46 PM] Forsaken#6131
Is 90 Hash rate bad?


[05/20/2021 12:47 PM] Busata#9432
according to their calculator that gets you 0.27 ergo per day


[05/20/2021 12:47 PM] Busata#9432
which is 3 dollars!


[05/20/2021 12:48 PM] Forsaken#6131
is it normal for it to use only like 1/4 of my gpu

[05/20/2021 12:48 PM] andee#4722
are you using the secret or the hash to authenticate?


[05/20/2021 12:49 PM] Busata#9432
someone else will have to help you with that, I don't mine myself, only toyed around with it for a bit


[05/20/2021 12:49 PM] ominous.shark#8410
the secret to authenticate. The hash in the response body is stored in ergo.conf

[05/20/2021 12:51 PM] ominous.shark#8410
my secret seems to authorize this ^ when I'm in swagger.


[05/20/2021 12:51 PM] ominous.shark#8410
but when I hit the blue button "Set API key" under http://127.0.0.1:9053/panel/ it says "bad API key"


[05/20/2021 12:52 PM] andee#4722
hmm 🤔


[05/20/2021 12:52 PM] ominous.shark#8410
right?!


[05/20/2021 12:52 PM] andee#4722
and you have restarted the node?


[05/20/2021 12:52 PM] ominous.shark#8410
yes.


[05/20/2021 12:52 PM] ominous.shark#8410
my secret is a string and not just one word. Might that be a problem?


[05/20/2021 12:53 PM] andee#4722
maybe. I have no spaces in my secret


[05/20/2021 12:53 PM] Busata#9432
@Forsaken try the #⛏│mining channel perhaps, people discuss configs/setups there


[05/20/2021 12:53 PM] andee#4722
try 'this is my secret'


[05/20/2021 12:53 PM] andee#4722
when authenticating


[05/20/2021 12:54 PM] ominous.shark#8410
Also, if I authorize Swagger, can I change the secret, get the new hash, download the .json can I change it?


[05/20/2021 12:54 PM] ominous.shark#8410
Under Swagger or my node Panel?


[05/20/2021 12:55 PM] ominous.shark#8410
When I type 'this is my secret' in Swagger, it seems to unlock it..... weird


[05/20/2021 12:55 PM] andee#4722
node panel, you said it worked in swagger


[05/20/2021 12:55 PM] ominous.shark#8410
'this is my secret' does not work in node panel. I still get "bad api key"


[05/20/2021 12:56 PM] andee#4722
hash secret, change in config, restart


[05/20/2021 12:56 PM] ominous.shark#8410
do I need to download the json and store the new one in directory/wallet/keystore


[05/20/2021 12:57 PM] andee#4722
what json are you talking about?


[05/20/2021 12:58 PM] andee#4722
```ergo {
    directory = ${ergo.directory}"/.ergo"
    node {
        mining = false
    }
    wallet.secretStorage.secretDir = ${ergo.directory}"/wallet/keystore"
}


scorex {
    restApi {
        # Hex-encoded Blake2b256 hash of an API key. 
        # Should be 64-chars long Base16 string.
        # below is the hash of the string 'hello'
        # replace with your actual hash 
        apiKeyHash = "secret_hash"
    }
}
```


[05/20/2021 12:58 PM] andee#4722
my config


[05/20/2021 12:59 PM] ominous.shark#8410
maybe I'm mistaken, but in /wallet/keystore there is a .json file. Beside the computed hash on Swagger there is a button that says "download" and it downloads a .json and I thought maybe there was a connection between these files. Maybe I'm mistaken.


[05/20/2021 12:59 PM] ominous.shark#8410
also under apiKeyHash = I need to keep my hash in quotes, correct?


[05/20/2021 12:59 PM] andee#4722
yes


[05/20/2021 1:00 PM] andee#4722
you only have a option to download the response, which will be your hashed secret


[05/20/2021 1:00 PM] andee#4722
when you see and think something, just try it and look at the result


[05/20/2021 1:01 PM] ominous.shark#8410
okay. before I try this, one last question. After I start the .jar file to run the node and then open Swagger, do I need to click the authorize button with the lock icon to actually change my secret and the computed hash? or no?


[05/20/2021 1:03 PM] andee#4722
you change the secret in the config file


[05/20/2021 1:03 PM] andee#4722
did you read the guide?


[05/20/2021 1:04 PM] ominous.shark#8410
a long time ago when I initially set this up.


[05/20/2021 1:04 PM] ominous.shark#8410
I'll give it a whirl


[05/20/2021 1:05 PM] andee#4722
use it as a 'cheatsheet' then


[05/20/2021 1:05 PM] andee#4722
☝️


[05/20/2021 1:06 PM] andee#4722
or just change config and start, if its already stopped


[05/20/2021 1:06 PM] andee#4722
there is no API call to change the secret as far as I know


[05/20/2021 1:08 PM] ominous.shark#8410
@andee THANK YOU!


[05/20/2021 1:08 PM] ominous.shark#8410
I thought I had lost my ERG

@ominous.shark Nice!! 😃

😆 

[05/20/2021 1:11 PM] ominous.shark#8410
will my balance be 0 until 4.0.10 is synced?


[05/20/2021 1:11 PM] ominous.shark#8410
I didn't create a new wallet or anything when I changed the secret an the hash (seems like a dumb question, but I gotta ask anyway 😛 )


[05/20/2021 1:12 PM] andee#4722
you need to sync


[05/20/2021 1:12 PM] andee#4722
and you need to restore your wallet


[05/20/2021 1:12 PM] ominous.shark#8410
restore?


[05/20/2021 1:13 PM] ominous.shark#8410
is there a guide for that?


[05/20/2021 1:13 PM] andee#4722
it doesnt restore your wallet by just setting up a node, you need to input your seed


[05/20/2021 1:13 PM] ominous.shark#8410
right. I got the seed. i've recall doing that in the past. I can do that.


[05/20/2021 1:14 PM] ominous.shark#8410
I might just use Yoroi when this is done syncing. I might be in over my head as it were.


[05/20/2021 1:14 PM] andee#4722
you dont need a synced node for running yoroi


[05/20/2021 1:15 PM] ominous.shark#8410
exactly. Then I won't need to run the node. Unless that strengthens the network.


[05/20/2021 1:16 PM] ominous.shark#8410
also, when I successfully set my new api key, there was no button for "initialize wallet" just "unlock" wallet. Does that mean I don't need to restore?


[05/20/2021 1:29 PM] andee#4722
you need to use swagger


[05/20/2021 1:33 PM] ominous.shark#8410
how do I restore the wallet in swagger (I'll once again inquire after a guide)


[05/20/2021 1:36 PM] ominous.shark#8410
I'm in Swagger. Looking under POST /wallet/restore

There are three parameters that need to be passed. "pass", "mnemonic" and "mnemonicPass". What is this mnemonicPass? Do I leave spaces between the mnemonic words?


[05/20/2021 1:36 PM] andee#4722
@ominous.shark I have only used swagger for stuff, as I don't see a reason for using the node wallet other than programmability

[05/20/2021 1:37 PM] andee#4722
but a quick look in the panel and... 🙂


[05/20/2021 1:38 PM] andee#4722
What do you see next to 'Update API key' ? 🙂


[05/20/2021 1:39 PM] ominous.shark#8410
Unlock Wallet


[05/20/2021 1:39 PM] andee#4722
I guess if you set a password when you created it?


[05/20/2021 1:39 PM] ominous.shark#8410
Yeah, I set a password


[05/20/2021 1:40 PM] andee#4722
so you made a new wallet, but did not input your seed?


[05/20/2021 1:41 PM] ominous.shark#8410
well I made the wallet and initialized it when I originally set up the Node


[05/20/2021 1:42 PM] andee#4722
well, then just unlock your wallet and wait for sync?


[05/20/2021 1:42 PM] ominous.shark#8410
I guess so.


[05/20/2021 1:42 PM] andee#4722
You could have said you already had the wallet files


[05/20/2021 1:43 PM] ominous.shark#8410
It just weirded me out that going from 4.0.9 to 4.0.10 would make my wallet balance go back to 0


[05/20/2021 1:44 PM] ominous.shark#8410
You're right. I just wasn't sure if changing my secret and the new hash would effect the wallet I had when I set this node up months ago.


[05/20/2021 1:46 PM] ominous.shark#8410
My main problem was that (I'm using Chrome) I had used a string of words for my secret and Chrome was storing it and I'd just have to single click the field when I opened the "Set API key" window and it would auto fill the secret. But somehow cookies got deleted and I had forgotten the secret.


[05/20/2021 1:47 PM] ominous.shark#8410
I then remembered I had written down the secret phrase. I then used Swagger to confirm that my secret phrase output the correct hash - which it did. But then I kept getting "bad API key" so then you guided me to reset it and that worked.


[05/20/2021 2:04 PM] andee#4722
👍


[05/20/2021 2:04 PM] andee#4722
hope it works out when its synced 🙂


[05/20/2021 2:04 PM] andee#4722
what does 'Synchronization state' say?


[05/20/2021 2:13 PM] ominous.shark#8410

oh also, for anyone wondering that didnt catch this, kushti and ilya responded to my question on /wallet/deriveNextKey in #🛠│development that endpoint uses harded bip32 to derive public addresses, so they cannot be associated. kushti posted this wiki for more info.

If anyone hits the send all button in Yoroi on a deposit to coinex let me know. I have been trying to create a backchannel support to unwind that issue.


[05/20/2021 7:18 PM] kranebitt#0334
Hi @Armeanio , thanks again a lot with your support on BitMart. ERG withdrawals/deposits were disabled without notice for about three weeks now. Today, like two days after your message to them, the service was reactivated and I managed to get all my ERGs out. How does the saying go: "Keep all your ERGs in one basket and watch the basket carefully" 🙂


[05/20/2021 7:50 PM] Armeanio#0321
Np glad it is resolved.

coinex, their official website says that 15-30 confirmations will be available, but now there are hundreds of confirmations that have not yet arrived

~~I am attempting to send ERG from my node wallet, but getting an "unsigned boxes" error. Am I doing something wrong?~~ Resolved


[05/21/2021 4:51 PM] Tolstojevski#7462
My colleague asked a question a few days ago, figure we should provide more details and hopefully someone can push us in the right direction 🙂 I have a client that mined ergo for a while and his wallet, Yoroi, broke. Unfortunately, no mnemonics. Fortunately, I've managed to extract and decrypt the master extended key. 4 bytes for network, all the depth data (all zeros as they should be), 32 bytes for the chain and 32 for the value, untouched 🙂 . As I did not know a lot about ergo before, took it as a good chance to learn, wrote some code that produces derivate keys and all that, but I'm still at a loss as to how to recover the funds. My two planned approaches ATM are figuring out how the ergo node wallet keystore encrypts the secret and just force feeding it my key after generating a dummy wallet, that or somehow just using the api (perhaps /wallet/transaction/send ) to make the transaction manually as I've the key to sign it with. Just that everything seems to demand mnemonics, and those we do not have :/. Thanks you for reading all of this 🙂 even under these dire circumstances it's nice to learn about ergo, think I will keep working on it, lovely platform.

[05/21/2021 7:35 PM] Att1Tude#4721
If i got this right i'd get ERG in average-over-time but can this be calculated. I mean can it be year, day, month scale i get something mined, my hashrate is 45 atm. Wallet and node is synced. Is worker name necessary after wallet password in NBminer exec? I had made an api key as "hello" by mistake due the video wasn't 100% clear, so i remade the ERGO folder again(saved old ergo folder, it's 7,5g large, does it have use in future or should i just delete it)


[05/21/2021 7:38 PM] andee#4722
@Att1Tude just use yoroi, if your'e a noob, don't use the node wallet


[05/21/2021 7:40 PM] Att1Tude#4721
I wanted to use desktop wallet but if that's what i should do then okay


[05/21/2021 7:40 PM] andee#4722
its just easier


[05/21/2021 7:40 PM] andee#4722
there is one other desktop wallet though, haven't used it


[05/21/2021 7:43 PM] Att1Tude#4721
Yea Coinbarn it seems. Ok i'ma install Yoroi, who knows if i need Cardano wallet anyway sometime. Thanks^^


[05/21/2021 7:54 PM] Att1Tude#4721
Ok made the wallet there. Also added the address in the .exec. I'm using NBminer, should i use nano insstead or something else, or keep using NBminer?


[05/21/2021 7:56 PM] Canberry#7404
keep NB

Do i need to run node too? I'm bit lost with this ErgoStratumProxy stuff. What is the pool IP here, is it my own ip(whatismyip.com), worker name as wallet name or where do i obtain this, can it be literally anything like worker1?

you can just copy paste the guide for your pool

herominers has it at least


[05/21/2021 9:02 PM] Att1Tude#4721
So i don't need to run node, is this only solomining thing


[05/21/2021 9:03 PM] Canberry#7404
node is for solo


[05/21/2021 9:03 PM] Canberry#7404
you dont need to if you're doing pool

because my real ip address doesnt work


[05/22/2021 4:24 AM] nitram147#5106
I would probably take another way -> convert recovered key back to mnemonics and use the seed in new instance of yoroi wallet 🙂


[05/22/2021 4:26 AM] nitram147#5106
But it depends on which key you had recovered. In case you recovered derived key (after derivation from prior entropy using bip39), it wouldn't be possible


[05/22/2021 4:27 AM] nitram147#5106
But it still should be possible to make another yoroi instance and insert the key there 🙂


[05/22/2021 4:28 AM] nitram147#5106
(Same way as you did when you where recovering it)


[05/22/2021 6:08 AM] Att1Tude#4721
Ok mined overnight and Yoroi shows 0.0000, can this be right, does it have delay?


[05/22/2021 6:18 AM] Snax#3268
You probably mined less than the threshold for your pool.


[05/22/2021 6:18 AM] Snax#3268
See if that's the problem. You might be able to decrease it, or just wait for it to be reached.


[05/22/2021 6:50 AM] io8126#2322
Has anyone received ergo on coinex in the last couple of days? Two tx with hundreds of confirmations, open ticket, no response for more than 48 hours.

Assume it's average-per-time but is there any way to calc it. Hard to see if this is profitable coinwise if it takes for example a year 😂

YAy now i found it thanks!!!!

With my machine mining in the background (I have a 1070) I get about 45.79 MH/s. It will take me about 5 days to mine 1 ERG


[05/22/2021 8:15 AM] Att1Tude#4721
0.03 atm, so few days


[05/22/2021 8:16 AM] Att1Tude#4721
I have similar hashrates. Noticed yesterday i lowered my CPU OC and got 2 H/s more


[05/22/2021 8:17 AM] Snax#3268
Cool! Glad I could help.

Well the ERGO node/wallet is still a misery to me. 
I was trying really hard to find out how to get more addresses. 

Not related to my try to get an answer I installed ErgoMixer and connected it yesterday. And now my wallet looks like this. +6 addresses
Anybody can explain this to me? What do I see and why? 

I did not touch the ErgoMixer yet...

Hello, I've launched new node, synced state, then I've copied state and wallet folders from previous node and tried to unlock wallet, but got error 400, wallet not initialized


[05/22/2021 5:52 PM] Roman Dolgov#0692
What can I do with it?

@Roman Dolgov I don't know how the process for this is, but I would not have copied the state from the previous node but only wallet

in Ergo, hardened derivation is used, so public keys can't be linked

Hi


[05/26/2021 7:18 AM] TSNP#1337
How can I setup a wallet for ERGO


[05/26/2021 7:18 AM] TSNP#1337
And where do you recommend me to store ERGO and to sell it?


[05/26/2021 7:48 AM] Busata#9432
you can use yoroi (browser extension) to create a wallet, and I think in random order the popular exchanges seem to be tradeogre, coinex & gate.io


[05/26/2021 7:49 AM] Busata#9432
and to improve security you could only use yoroi on a device you don't use as daily driver or so, something that's not connected to the internet 24/7 🙂


[05/26/2021 7:53 AM] Busata#9432
I think it's generally recommended not to store coins on exchanges itself, so only send it over when you want to sell I guess


[05/26/2021 7:53 AM] Busata#9432
not that you should sell ergo, you should keep it, cuddle it, and watch it grow for a few years, but that's just me!


[05/26/2021 9:02 AM] anon_real#2768
DM me if you still have the problem.


[05/26/2021 3:03 PM] arokace#8057
Need help on 2 things.  
One I don't know what I'm doing wrong with trying to get somee SigRSV.  I've tried 3 times from the official ergo wallet and yoroi's wallet and nothing has happened so far (did them yesterday at this point so enough time should have gone by).

Two, when transfering some ergo from the official wallet to yoroi (thought maybe the official one didn't work with Sigma).  I think I might have lost 1 ergo in the transaction.  It is showing that I sent 1 ergo to a random address I never entered.  My wallet still says I have what I should have but the address info in the explorer says its not in the address anymore.


[05/26/2021 3:48 PM] Mance Pax#5004
hello again, did you manage to get any news from them? I see that they also stopped ERG deposits, not just withdrawals..


[05/26/2021 5:54 PM] Spicemustflow#1078
Can somebody help me with my ergo node wallet? I’ve managed to deposit some ergo to my address but I cannot see them in my balance. If I click on my address it just says 2000sometging confirmations and still counting.


[05/26/2021 8:03 PM] kushti#0978
You mean ergo node's wallet? Is it synced ?


[05/26/2021 8:03 PM] kushti#0978
Official wallet == node wallet ?


[05/26/2021 8:03 PM] arokace#8057
yea

We are waiting for Fri now


[05/26/2021 8:04 PM] Spicemustflow#1078
Yes, now for some reason my api key isn’t accepted


[05/26/2021 8:05 PM] TSNP#1337
It would be efficiently if I mine some ERGO directly to my Yoroi-wallet and then transfer it to coinex or gate.io to trade it for some USDT and after that I transfer it to binance and sell it there for my local currency?


[05/26/2021 8:05 PM] TSNP#1337
And also, which is better? coinex or gate.io


[05/26/2021 8:06 PM] andee#4722
gate.io has an insane KYC process from what I have gathered


[05/26/2021 8:07 PM] TSNP#1337
Which one of these do u use

But it doesnt show in my wallet


[05/27/2021 12:20 AM] Doomelf#7740
Did you send it to the correct address?


[05/27/2021 12:21 AM] Doomelf#7740
it usually shows pending and than it will arrive


[05/27/2021 12:22 AM] Degen#1684
It says sent


[05/27/2021 12:22 AM] Degen#1684
On my exchange


[05/27/2021 12:22 AM] Degen#1684
and it shows up when i click on the address as multiple transactions


[05/27/2021 12:22 AM] Degen#1684
but nothing on the actual yoroi wallet


[05/27/2021 12:22 AM] ziggomatic#9335
have been some reports of yoroi funkiness with erg. it has its own  channel on this discord if you wanna troubleshoot in there. i guess so long as it's in the explorer and acknowledged then it's not a blockchain or address issue


[05/27/2021 12:23 AM] Degen#1684
Which channel is this?


[05/27/2021 12:23 AM] ziggomatic#9335
#💳┃yoroi


[05/27/2021 12:23 AM] ziggomatic#9335
which browser did you yoroi in btw?


[05/27/2021 12:24 AM] Degen#1684
google


[05/27/2021 12:25 AM] Nythain#6769
Yoroi has a resync option. Not sure where off the top of my head cause im on mobile atm but look for it and try


[05/27/2021 12:25 AM] Degen#1684
Thanks man let me know


[05/27/2021 12:25 AM] Degen#1684
i was about to drop a few grand if a dip happened


[05/27/2021 12:25 AM] Degen#1684
This shit is pissing me off though


[05/27/2021 12:26 AM] ziggomatic#9335
you can resync from the Settings -> Wallet thing


[05/27/2021 12:26 AM] ziggomatic#9335
and yeah i guess it has some teething issues


[05/27/2021 12:26 AM] Degen#1684

The wallet address they gave me is invalid according to Yoroi

Alright thank you


[05/27/2021 12:28 AM] Degen#1684

i think you can generate a new one


[05/27/2021 12:31 AM] Michawl_#2646
It won't let me since the one it made has never been used


[05/27/2021 12:32 AM] Michawl_#2646
The deposit address is also shorter than any of the addresses in the mining transaction


[05/27/2021 12:32 AM] Michawl_#2646
But this was the case for both coinex and probit so I don't know what to do here


[05/27/2021 12:33 AM] Degen#1684
haha I have no idea either my shit is broken at the moment aswell


[05/27/2021 12:34 AM] Michawl_#2646
This is annoying


[05/27/2021 12:34 AM] Michawl_#2646
I want to trade some for btc which has easier liquidity to pay my power bill, but I guess I won't mine ergo directly until I can figure out how to transact the little bit that I have

[05/27/2021 12:49 AM] Michawl_#2646
good that I checked this stuff before going full bar into mining it


[05/27/2021 12:50 AM] Michawl_#2646
does that mean I'd have to run a node to get a wallet going right now, not something I'd really want to do...


[05/27/2021 12:52 AM] Nythain#6769
If you in fact encountered this bug, from what i gather your only real option would be setup a node and recreate your wallet with seed. Not sure if thats been proven to work. Has been submitted to github, hopefully they will adress the issue asap but who knows.


[05/27/2021 12:53 AM] Michawl_#2646
how much storage space is a node up to right now roughly?


[05/27/2021 12:54 AM] Nythain#6769
No clue, never had a reason to set one up.


[05/27/2021 12:54 AM] ziggomatic#9335

It's something people ask about often so I guess it just takes a while to reflect


[05/27/2021 11:54 AM] Shepolad#5729
what do you mean 'reflect' my dude?


[05/27/2021 11:55 AM] glasgowm#9381
As in people often report that issue, then you never hear from them again. So there must be a delay. Or maybe they switch to Yoroi.


[05/27/2021 12:00 PM] Shepolad#5729
aahh ok, think ill switch . thx


[05/27/2021 12:03 PM] Shepolad#5729

[05/27/2021 5:45 PM] arokace#8057
So I transferred some Ergo from my node/wallet to Yoroi.  And my node/wallet reports the correct amount in its wallet (says 2 erg) but when I look at my address in Ergo Explorer it says 1 erg.

Here's the transaction in Ergo Explorer:  https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/d863a179108e573793f54a448cc2dcef158ff115fa7cc0ac88f947b397db5b34

2.024 erg sent to my Yoroi wallet, the 0.001 tx fee to another address, and then shows 1 erg going to an address I have no idea about.  And if you view my whole address it says there's only one.  I would like the erg back but also understand that it might be lost to the ether.  Or maybe this is a bug, idk, 'tis why I'm here.

SigmaUSD also says I only have 1 erg in the wallet (which makes sense, I assume its reading my address from explorer)

Someone sent me 1 erg before and I can see that it looks like it might be typical to send extra Erg out on transactions but with the transaction that they sent me it on it shows their own address for that Erg vs mine is some address I have no control over.
Here's the transaction in explorer:
https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/18e4d06056941783556446277248c2c7cf2968ca747f0fe3d5eacb3a3f455d45


[05/27/2021 8:12 PM] arokace#8057
Ok what is wrong with the node/wallet.  I just sent the stuff from my Yoroi wallet back to my node/wallet.  This went fine.  Then purchased SigmaRSV.  This purchase just sent ANOTHER 1 erg to the same random address.  Like am I not understanding something about the Ergo network or what.  

https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/addresses/9ewvttJ4YbSkM3C9dv855ZkBaEFUume7oKTtRR4w18AXutUc2kJ

Like as far as I can tell no one has control over this address these Erg got sent to.  The total it says to have is about what I should have according to the wallet.  Again the wallet is still reporting what I should have but the explorer does not, I assume the explorer is right


[05/27/2021 8:19 PM] andee#4722
@arokace does the 1 ERG match the fee for purchasing SigmaRSV?


[05/27/2021 8:20 PM] arokace#8057
I don't recall but I don't think the fee was 1 erg on 2 erg worth of RSV


[05/27/2021 8:20 PM] arokace#8057
But this has happened twice now when sending coin out from my node wallet


[05/27/2021 8:21 PM] arokace#8057
I have a grand total of 4 erg, or rather I did


[05/27/2021 8:23 PM] Nythain#6769
Fucked up part is, the first address only has that one transaction and that one erg.


[05/27/2021 8:24 PM] arokace#8057
I got the RSV I purchased, so that part of it went fine.  But I have still lost 2 erg though


[05/27/2021 8:24 PM] andee#4722
is 9ewvttJ4YbSkM3C9dv855ZkBaEFUume7oKTtRR4w18AXutUc2kJ the address?


[05/27/2021 8:25 PM] arokace#8057
that's the random one, yup


[05/27/2021 8:27 PM] arokace#8057
But when I look at my wallet in the node, it shows my erg there... So the wallet knows to look at that address to calculate how much Erg I have (I'm assuming at least)


[05/27/2021 8:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
addreses starting with 9 are yoroi ones usually


[05/27/2021 8:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
Not anything internal to the erg network


[05/27/2021 8:32 PM] glasgowm#9381
Looks like you have a different addresses connected to sigma or something


[05/27/2021 8:34 PM] arokace#8057
That doesn't explain when I transfered from the node/wallet to yoroi then


[05/27/2021 8:36 PM] glasgowm#9381
yeah I mean it's a wallet and not a proxy or fee address


[05/27/2021 8:38 PM] Nythain#6769
really curious to see how this resolves


[05/27/2021 8:39 PM] glasgowm#9381
not sure what you mean. If I had to guess you copied 2 different addresses from the receive tab from the same wallet. Sigma returned it to a different address (under the same wallet) - which is why when you view the address directly via explorer or sigmausd you only see what's on that address. Vs yoroi and node where you'll see the full wallet.


[05/27/2021 8:41 PM] arokace#8057
That is something I've thought that my node/wallet has other addresses it isn't telling me amount.  Would explain why it still thinks I have what I should have.  But I don't have direct control of the address either way, the wallet might indirectly control it though.

But what I was talking about there is from the previous post I said that had nothing to do with Sigma, just transferring from my node wallet to Yoroi.


[05/27/2021 8:41 PM] andee#4722
Just try sending the full amount of your wallet to your main address


[05/27/2021 8:43 PM] glasgowm#9381
yeh just as you said you viewed it in sigma. If you go to the receive tab and scroll down you should see all the associated addresses


[05/27/2021 8:44 PM] arokace#8057
I did Sigma through my node wallet, doesn't have a tab to see associated addresses


[05/27/2021 8:45 PM] arokace#8057
Doesn't like me doing that >_< giving me an error.


[05/27/2021 8:46 PM] andee#4722
look at history on sigmausd.io


[05/27/2021 8:47 PM] arokace#8057
Yea, that's fine.  It says the correct amount for everything.  It isn't a Sigma issue, its a node/wallet issue.


[05/27/2021 8:47 PM] andee#4722
check the addresses in the history


[05/27/2021 8:47 PM] Nythain#6769
so much focus on sigma, when the first instance of the disappearing erg happened before the attempted sigma purchases


[05/27/2021 8:47 PM] arokace#8057
yea


[05/27/2021 8:48 PM] andee#4722
whats the address of the wallet missing erg?


[05/27/2021 8:48 PM] arokace#8057
guess really no one here uses the node/wallet though.  There is no "history" in the node/wallet


[05/27/2021 8:48 PM] arokace#8057
this is my wallet address for the node/wallet that I have been using for mining:  9f5F4UeFEhcVrkdkdK954R9gT5CVS3jtSgwSceHZZMewdAzGjT2


[05/27/2021 8:51 PM] andee#4722
Haven't actually used it for sending/receiving, but I have it running


[05/27/2021 8:51 PM] andee#4722
the history that was talked about was on sigma, not the node wallet

[05/27/2021 8:54 PM] andee#4722
the 1 ERG was sent in the same transaction 🤔


[05/27/2021 8:54 PM] andee#4722
this may be because of how utxo works, no?


[05/27/2021 8:55 PM] arokace#8057
yea, its weird.  and if you look at this transaction (when I received an 1 Erg from someone):  https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/18e4d06056941783556446277248c2c7cf2968ca747f0fe3d5eacb3a3f455d45

You see that it did send an extra erg out to.  The only difference is it sent it right back to their own wallet.  So this leads me to believe there is a bug in there official wallet.


[05/27/2021 8:56 PM] andee#4722
so did you restore from yoroi seed or make a completely new wallet?


[05/27/2021 8:57 PM] arokace#8057
neither


[05/27/2021 8:57 PM] arokace#8057
or what do you mean


[05/27/2021 8:57 PM] arokace#8057
I created the Yoroi wallet when I thought I was doing something wrong with Sigma but turned out I was just being stupid.  But I didn't restore anything though.


[05/27/2021 8:58 PM] arokace#8057
The Yoroi wallet is like 2 days old, my node wallet is at least a month old


[05/27/2021 9:32 PM] arokace#8057
Does anyone know what Spent and Unspent means in Ergo Explorer?

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/670288337747312646/847572899451109376/unknown.png


[05/27/2021 9:55 PM] arokace#8057
Cause I was looking around in swagger and saw a section that says "Get a list of unspent boxes" and the "random address" I have been talking about is there.  So maybe what I'm asking for isn't support at this point but rather an understanding.  Andee said something about how the UTXO system works.  Something about 'change' which is what I was thinking was going on but was still unsure (would explain why the wallet sees what I have).

I guess if what I am gathering is right.  Once I choose to send this coin somewhere else again, my wallet will understand and know to use this "unspent wallet address" to get my ergo from.


[05/27/2021 9:56 PM] arokace#8057
Does this sound remotely correct?


[05/27/2021 11:07 PM] glasgowm#9381
this is just how utxo works


[05/27/2021 11:08 PM] arokace#8057
So just confirming then, I don't have anything to worry about.


[05/27/2021 11:09 PM] glasgowm#9381
nope, just the way utxo does transactions under btc, ada, etc.

keep tabs on the size of the ergo folder, should be a good indication on its progress

[05/29/2021 6:55 PM] essaias#5787
well IDK coinex but usually its all the same. sell them for the right price, as USDT, ETH or BTC and then exchange that to fiat. (USD, EUR) 
Later can be withdrawn to your bank account. But agian IDK coinex. Maybe they don't have this feature. Others probably know

[05/29/2021 6:56 PM] essaias#5787
you will usually need to do KYC before you can send FIAT to your bank account.

Hello. I withdrew some ERGs from coinex to my yoroi and it has over 15 confirmations but I cannot see my ERGs on my yoroi wallet. Any idea if it requires more confirmations or if there has been some sort of bug? I've sent ergs from coinex before without any issues so Im worried something happend. Its not wrong address, i triple checked it.
Here is my tXID: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/d9fe236a3bf9c76f77c1bc4bfa3d0f61576f31f88a2381209b05b3b2183ed509

so can I use the same seed mnemonic when I start the full node to access the funds?

thanks


[05/30/2021 3:41 PM] mconstant#4986
hope you comfortable with a bit o command line


[05/30/2021 3:41 PM] mconstant#4986
let me know if you need halps


[05/30/2021 3:42 PM] mconstant#4986
if you have linux there is apparently a one liner


[05/30/2021 3:54 PM] arokace#8057
Does take a couple hours to get synced the first time.  But it has all the functionality you need and more.


[05/30/2021 3:54 PM] arokace#8057
that would have been nice >_< fucking windows


[05/30/2021 3:55 PM] Nythain#6769
<goes to install node wallet><4 hours pass still syncing><yoroi fixed>"fml"


[05/30/2021 3:55 PM] mconstant#4986
amirite?


[05/30/2021 3:55 PM] andee#4722
its not that hard to run the node on windows? just make a bat file, paste the line add pause on next line?


[05/30/2021 3:55 PM] mconstant#4986
right


[05/30/2021 3:56 PM] mconstant#4986
let's make the script


[05/30/2021 3:56 PM] arokace#8057
no its not, I have a batch file too.  But I think mconstant meant for the setup, linux can get it all in one line is what they were saying I think?


[05/30/2021 3:56 PM] mconstant#4986
thing is ... it needs java, and sbt


[05/30/2021 3:56 PM] mconstant#4986
but that could be easy to throw together


[05/30/2021 3:56 PM] andee#4722
if anyone is proficient, make a powershell script to make the secret and add it automagically to the config


[05/30/2021 3:57 PM] mconstant#4986
I only bash


[05/30/2021 3:57 PM] mconstant#4986
lulz


[05/30/2021 3:57 PM] mconstant#4986
but I know some powershell people that could help me fish


[05/30/2021 3:57 PM] andee#4722
@mconstant same. I use podman and docker to run the node though


[05/30/2021 3:57 PM] mconstant#4986
thing is package managers for scripting not out of the box on windows


[05/30/2021 3:57 PM] andee#4722
so no java to be found on this system


[05/30/2021 3:57 PM] mconstant#4986
docker is nice


[05/30/2021 3:58 PM] mconstant#4986
podman I can't


[05/30/2021 3:58 PM] mconstant#4986
kinda hate redhat


[05/30/2021 3:58 PM] andee#4722
powershell is on all windows installations though


[05/30/2021 3:58 PM] mconstant#4986
but I should get over teh hate


[05/30/2021 3:58 PM] mconstant#4986
at least it is rootle


[05/30/2021 3:58 PM] mconstant#4986
ss


[05/30/2021 3:59 PM] arokace#8057
I'm not proficent in the slightest but I imagine it couldn't be that hard to learn how to create one to do all that.  I guess the biggest thing is there a way to install java and sbt through command line?


[05/30/2021 3:59 PM] andee#4722
haha. I don't have any hate towards them, but rootless is to be preferred either way


[05/30/2021 3:59 PM] mconstant#4986

[05/30/2021 4:01 PM] Nythain#6769
fucking java, pretty sure that's why i'm *not* running a node


[05/30/2021 4:01 PM] mconstant#4986
lucky you getting all provisioned for free with the container

[05/30/2021 4:01 PM] arokace#8057
rereading the instructions, not sure if its something you have to install, its just a command that is ran during the setup process

So I have a GeForce 3070 and I just wanna check out my hashrate for to see if I can mine. If I told someone my computer specs could anyone help me out?


[05/31/2021 8:29 PM] arokace#8057
3070s get about 170mh.  But if you want to see reports, go to the #⛏│mining channel pinned messages.  The first one should be a spreadsheet of peoples OCs, their hashes, and what card(s) they are using


[05/31/2021 8:32 PM] titan63#4482
@arokace  thank you, and is 170mh any good?


[05/31/2021 8:32 PM] arokace#8057
I'm mining ergo with 86mh, some are mining with 28mh.


[05/31/2021 8:49 PM] Nythain#6769
That would be me lol


[06/01/2021 4:40 PM] cts#9459
In the process of creating a wallet address and somehow things are not working out correctly.  I got the latest Java installed and the Ergo client release.  I then copied the ergo.conf text and ran the mainnet line as both the website and youtube video explain.  It took a while but eventually I have a little over 6GB of, presumably the blockchain, downloaded.  However where I get stuck is clicking on the 127.0.0.1 URL where I receive the message "error" : 500, "reason" : 
"internal.error", "detail" : "C:\\ (The system cannot find the path specified)"  I'm not seeing where I went wrong, please advise.


[06/01/2021 4:43 PM] andee#4722
@cts you get that at http://127.0.0.1:9053/swagger#/ ?


[06/01/2021 4:45 PM] cts#9459
127.0.0.1:9053/swagger#/utils/hashBlake2b


[06/01/2021 4:45 PM] cts#9459
I just right click and say open in new tab


[06/01/2021 4:46 PM] cts#9459
Now re-reading the prereqs it does state "ergo_folder" which I never did create.  I presumed this was a variable of whatever path or is this supposed to be literal?


[06/01/2021 4:51 PM] arokace#8057
I think I made this mistake too when setting up my node.  I thought that folder was either not gonna matte or get generated itself


[06/01/2021 4:52 PM] andee#4722
shouldn't need to do anything else than put the jar and config in a folder and run, no?


[06/01/2021 4:53 PM] cts#9459
And that may not be the issue.  I'm just wondering what I'm doing wrong to get the 500 error.  Great instructions, a litlte techy, but I'm up for it.


[06/01/2021 4:54 PM] andee#4722
have you tried restarting the node?


[06/01/2021 4:56 PM] andee#4722
If that doesn't work, try refreshing with CTRL + F5


[06/01/2021 5:00 PM] cts#9459
Restart the node with the same mainnet command?


[06/01/2021 5:01 PM] andee#4722
👍


[06/01/2021 5:02 PM] cts#9459
Restarted, it appears to have simply continued where it left off.  I refreshed the 127.0.0.1 page with the same result.


[06/01/2021 5:03 PM] andee#4722
does http://127.0.0.1:9053/panel work?


[06/01/2021 5:06 PM] cts#9459
Same result


[06/01/2021 5:06 PM] andee#4722
do you have a different browser to test with?


[06/01/2021 5:07 PM] cts#9459
Edge and Chrome have the same result


[06/01/2021 5:08 PM] cts#9459
Now the youtube video and the website have a different initial ergo.conf text.  The website does not state the path as the video does.


[06/01/2021 5:09 PM] cts#9459
I used the text on the website.


[06/01/2021 5:09 PM] andee#4722
thats correct


[06/01/2021 5:09 PM] andee#4722
you dont need that path


[06/01/2021 5:09 PM] cts#9459
I presumed the video was from a former version.


[06/01/2021 5:10 PM] andee#4722
it automatically makes a hidden folder named '.ergo' in the same folder as you have the jar and the config


[06/01/2021 5:11 PM] cts#9459
Correct.  FYI I installed Java version 16.0.1, the latest.


[06/01/2021 5:12 PM] cts#9459
However the PS seems to be running just fine.  A bunch of lines of code are slowly going by.


[06/01/2021 5:13 PM] andee#4722
I see that 9 or 11 is recommended. I am unable to test this unless I spin up a Windows VM


[06/01/2021 5:13 PM] cts#9459
If you suggest then I can uninstall this version and go back to 11.


[06/01/2021 5:14 PM] arokace#8057
I installed 11 I believe because it was one of the recommended ones. And Java is weird, the versions don't dictate what you normally would think a version does.  They have varying properties to them that some applications need from certain versions


[06/01/2021 5:14 PM] arokace#8057
You should be able to uninstall and reinstall the correct version without issue


[06/01/2021 5:14 PM] arokace#8057
probaly don't even need to uninstall the one your put in actually


[06/01/2021 5:15 PM] andee#4722
as much as I dislike snap, I really wish Windows had something like it 🙂


[06/01/2021 5:20 PM] cts#9459
Am I supposed to be downloading the LTS version for developers?  Somehow I got the 16 version downloaded but 11 wants a login.

https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html


[06/01/2021 5:21 PM] cts#9459
That's the version 11.0.11 however version 11.0.10 I can:

[06/01/2021 5:22 PM] arokace#8057
nvm


[06/01/2021 5:22 PM] cts#9459
I clicked on something last night where version 16 downloaded.  Now it appears not to


[06/01/2021 5:23 PM] cts#9459
I'll grab version 11.0.10 as it appears that is available.


[06/01/2021 5:25 PM] arokace#8057
There's also OpenJDK too (an open source variant) that should work

[06/01/2021 5:26 PM] ziggomatic#9335
if you have choco you can install/upgrade openjdk from that. is what i did


[06/01/2021 5:26 PM] arokace#8057
mmm, good to know


[06/01/2021 5:26 PM] andee#4722
they recommend oracle version and don't even mention openjdk


[06/01/2021 5:27 PM] andee#4722
but it works for you @ziggomatic ?


[06/01/2021 5:27 PM] ziggomatic#9335
yeah


[06/01/2021 5:27 PM] ziggomatic#9335
openjdk v16.0.1 and ergo 4.0.11


[06/01/2021 5:28 PM] smobert#1355

[06/01/2021 5:30 PM] ziggomatic#9335
fwiw, whilst choco isn't the best package manager in the world, it beats hunting down and installing shit by hand. i let it manage a bunch of crap


[06/01/2021 5:31 PM] cts#9459
Looks like a redo...


[06/01/2021 5:31 PM] cts#9459
If I'm using Ergo 4.0.11 then what exact version of Java should I be using?


[06/01/2021 5:32 PM] cts#9459
If you don't mind, post the URL, I'll download and restart the whole process over again.

[06/01/2021 5:35 PM] cts#9459
Well I'm seeing different versions suggested above.  The website suggests 9 or 11, check.  I had 16 and so I uninstalled it.  I downloaded  the JDK 11.0.10 version.  Now it seems to want to rerun the whole thing over again.  Is this normal so far?


[06/01/2021 5:36 PM] ziggomatic#9335
what is "rerun the whole thing over again" ?


[06/01/2021 5:36 PM] cts#9459
When I typed in the mainnet command on the website with the correct version the PS is scrolling like crazy as it was initially.  I can delete the .ergo folder and restart.


[06/01/2021 5:37 PM] ziggomatic#9335
yeah, it does that. it scrolls, while it syncs the blockchain


[06/01/2021 5:37 PM] ziggomatic#9335
you oughta be able to connect to the web server while it does its thing tho right?


[06/01/2021 5:38 PM] cts#9459
Well I need to leave for a bit so it may be wise to just remove the .ergo folder and restart the mainnet command and let it sync while I'm gone.  It is only about 6GB.


[06/01/2021 5:38 PM] ziggomatic#9335
sure


[06/01/2021 5:38 PM] cts#9459
Thanks for the prompt help and I'll be in touch one way or the other once I return.


[06/01/2021 5:38 PM] ziggomatic#9335
but you can interact with the node even while it's syncing


[06/01/2021 5:39 PM] cts#9459
Just restarted and still the same 500 error


[06/01/2021 5:39 PM] ziggomatic#9335
sec. scrolling up


[06/01/2021 5:41 PM] ziggomatic#9335
hm weird. sounds like some cwd/path resolution shit going wrong


[06/01/2021 5:41 PM] cts#9459
Not sure, I'll let it sync and when I get back then I'll restart and see what happens.  I will say this, for the layman this has got to be an insane way to get a wallet address.


[06/01/2021 5:42 PM] ziggomatic#9335
yeah. that method is definitely not for mainstream consumption yet


[06/01/2021 5:42 PM] ziggomatic#9335
you can build a wallet in yoroi if that's all you want


[06/01/2021 5:42 PM] cts#9459
I prefer desktop wallets though and Ergo sounds like a promising future.


[06/01/2021 5:43 PM] arokace#8057
It is definitely.  I've considered seeing if I could make a script or something for it so its more stream lined for laymen people


[06/01/2021 5:43 PM] ziggomatic#9335
nah. it needs the whole gui shebang.


[06/01/2021 5:43 PM] cts#9459
Well I'm off to earn fiat...  Hah.  I'll be in touch and thank you.


[06/01/2021 5:44 PM] arokace#8057
It would truly but if there was a script that did it all and asked for the api phrase and shit, that would still go a long way


[06/01/2021 5:45 PM] ziggomatic#9335
there are some ides that'll build a distributable exe, bundling up jdk and all that shit


[06/01/2021 5:46 PM] arokace#8057
That's definitely out of my league >_<.


[06/01/2021 5:47 PM] ziggomatic#9335
nah should be barely an inconvenience


[06/01/2021 5:51 PM] andee#4722
@cts paste the cmd you are using to start the node


[06/01/2021 7:51 PM] cts#9459
@andee straight from the Ergo website: java -jar ergo-4.0.11.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf


[06/01/2021 8:07 PM] andee#4722
try re-downloading the jar file if its still messed up. API should be accessible pretty quick after you start the node, even when not synced


[06/01/2021 8:32 PM] cts#9459
No dice.


[06/01/2021 8:33 PM] cts#9459
Still getting the error: 500


[06/01/2021 8:33 PM] cts#9459
reason : internal.error


[06/01/2021 8:33 PM] cts#9459
detail : c:\\ The system cannot find the path specified


[06/01/2021 8:42 PM] arokace#8057
This is being said on the site that's giving the 500 error or is this in the  CMD?


[06/01/2021 8:44 PM] cts#9459
The 500 error comes from the URL 
127.0.0.1:9053/swagger#/utils/hashBlake2b which I type in either Edge or Chrome.


[06/01/2021 8:44 PM] andee#4722
where is your folder located?


[06/01/2021 8:44 PM] andee#4722
what is in your config?


[06/01/2021 8:44 PM] cts#9459
on the C: drive


[06/01/2021 8:45 PM] andee#4722
path of the folder


[06/01/2021 8:45 PM] cts#9459
At the point of running: ergo {
  node {
    mining = false
  }
}


[06/01/2021 8:45 PM] cts#9459
The same text as what is on the website.


[06/01/2021 8:46 PM] cts#9459
Within that folder I have the ergo.conf and jdk 11.0.10


[06/01/2021 8:48 PM] cts#9459
The PS appears to work just fine, initially it downloaded about 6GB before it slowed down and appeared to be merely updating.  I since deleted that .ergo folder and uninstalled the version 16 jdk and started over with the suggested jdk 11.


[06/01/2021 8:49 PM] arokace#8057
The only other thing that's came to my mind is you have something on your computer that blocks accessing 127.0.0.1 addresses honestly.


[06/01/2021 8:49 PM] cts#9459
Possible.  This system is just for wallets.


[06/01/2021 8:50 PM] arokace#8057
That still would seem odd to me, that address is something computers have used to just connect to themselves for a long time.  What kind of security software is running on that computer?


[06/01/2021 8:51 PM] arokace#8057
Windows Firewall is fine.  Do you think you might have hit block before when you were setting it up (not sure if it would have even asked though, shouldn't care about a 127 address)


[06/01/2021 8:52 PM] cts#9459
I temporarily tried without the firewall with the same result

I'm curious as to what path it is seeking?


[06/01/2021 8:53 PM] arokace#8057
with the 127.0.0.1?


[06/01/2021 8:53 PM] cts#9459
Yes


[06/01/2021 8:53 PM] arokace#8057
I don't recall exactly how that address works but I'm pretty sure it doesn't even leave the computer if I remember right.


[06/01/2021 8:53 PM] andee#4722
I think there must be some problem with the java installation


[06/01/2021 8:54 PM] cts#9459
I could very well be missing a step, I'm just not sure where.  It was pointed out that I should be using version 11 vs. 16 and so I corrected that but that did not change the result.


[06/01/2021 8:57 PM] andee#4722
do you have JRE installed?


[06/01/2021 8:57 PM] cts#9459
jdk


[06/01/2021 8:57 PM] cts#9459
The website said either


[06/01/2021 8:59 PM] andee#4722
do you see any errors in the console output?


[06/01/2021 8:59 PM] andee#4722
look at the output as you try to connect to the API


[06/01/2021 9:00 PM] cts#9459
The text is flying by very, very fast.


[06/01/2021 9:00 PM] cts#9459
A lot of "apply modifier" lines


[06/01/2021 9:03 PM] arokace#8057
See if you can bring up command promt and ping 127.0.0.1


[06/01/2021 9:06 PM] cts#9459
yes


[06/01/2021 9:07 PM] arokace#8057
it pinged fine?  If so then doubt what I was thinking is it

[06/01/2021 9:11 PM] andee#4722
do you have some strange permissions on your stash folder? try stopping the sync and moving the content of the folder where jar, config and .ergo is to C:\ergo


[06/01/2021 9:13 PM] andee#4722
seems like you deleted the path from the chat for some reason, but I assume that the C:!Stash was just a typo


[06/01/2021 9:13 PM] cts#9459
WTF it works!!!


[06/01/2021 9:14 PM] arokace#8057
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh


[06/01/2021 9:14 PM] cts#9459
So is it hardcoded to be c:\ergo?!?


[06/01/2021 9:14 PM] andee#4722
That I doubt


[06/01/2021 9:14 PM] arokace#8057
nope, mines on my desktop.

Computers... what can you say... they don't make sense >_< lol


[06/01/2021 9:17 PM] arokace#8057
If what andee was saying about stash is wrong, as in it wasn't a typo and your stash is called !Stash, then it could just be because of that !

[06/01/2021 9:18 PM] cts#9459
c:\!stash


[06/01/2021 9:18 PM] cts#9459
with a slash


[06/01/2021 9:18 PM] arokace#8057
not C:\Stash


[06/01/2021 9:18 PM] arokace#8057
its C:\!Stash


[06/01/2021 9:18 PM] andee#4722
then thats probably it


[06/01/2021 9:18 PM] cts#9459
c:\\!stash

[06/01/2021 9:18 PM] ziggomatic#9335
the ! in your path


[06/01/2021 9:19 PM] cts#9459
Just to keep the folder at the top of the list

oh facepalm


[06/01/2021 9:19 PM] arokace#8057
What's wrong with being excited about your own stash?


[06/01/2021 9:19 PM] cts#9459
When I setup backups on ext drives I do the same thing just to separate or setup special folders in a Documents folder for someone.


[06/01/2021 9:20 PM] andee#4722

[06/01/2021 9:20 PM] cts#9459

[06/01/2021 9:21 PM] arokace#8057
http errors are the worst


[06/01/2021 9:21 PM] cts#9459
So Java doesn't like the ! or Ergo 4.0.11?


[06/01/2021 9:21 PM] andee#4722
the additional info was from the JRE


[06/01/2021 9:21 PM] andee#4722
```reason : internal.error

[06/01/2021 9:24 PM] cts#9459
Well I guess I can eventually migrate my other coins over to stash.  Organization is key...


[06/01/2021 9:24 PM] ziggomatic#9335
stash or !stash ?

I'm back...ugh.  Now I'm getting a bad API key.  I click Try it out and type in a strong password with quotes.  I've tried as little as 10 characters to as many as 64.  I then copy the website text to the conf file and the generated hash key with quotes.  Restart the PS.  Go to the panel link and attempt to enter the same strong password and I get a bad API key.


[06/02/2021 4:58 AM] cts#9459

Is the node 100% in sync? the API will fail unless it is


[06/02/2021 1:56 PM] andee#4722
swagger should work


[06/02/2021 2:06 PM] geezar#8187
True - not had any issues with the node - damn stable


[06/02/2021 2:27 PM] cts#9459
@geezar- Thanks for the reponse.  It has been syncing basically all night.  The panel page still says "Active synchronization" and the .ergo folder size is currently 4.5GB.  I presume this may take a while yet then?  Thanks for pointing out that we must wait for the syncing to finish.  I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong last night...


[06/02/2021 2:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
Should tell you the height then you can compare to the explorer


[06/02/2021 2:29 PM] cts#9459
@glasgowm - Please detail?


[06/02/2021 2:29 PM] glasgowm#9381
the page that says active sync also tells you the height


[06/02/2021 2:29 PM] glasgowm#9381
then compare it to https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/


[06/02/2021 2:30 PM] cts#9459
On the Node Information page it shows the version, sync state, started, mining status, and peers connected.


[06/02/2021 2:30 PM] cts#9459
I do see the Explorer tab which is the link above.


[06/02/2021 2:31 PM] geezar#8187
Thats positive, needs to complete - I seem to recal I stopped / re-started as it had hung after a couple hours (run the command line if you still have the console open and re-run the command)

I must have screwed something up yesterday.  I deleted the .ergo folder and started over and now it states the "Best block id" on the Node Information page.


[06/02/2021 2:48 PM] geezar#8187
@cts I re-did the build after messing the first try up - the FAQ & Video were slightly inconsistant but 2nd build - waited 5 hours for sync - and perfect, make sure to back up any DIR's 'just in case' always easier to del them if no longer needed or having to restore files etc

is there anyway to find value of a variable x mod an arbitrary number k in ergoscript?


[06/02/2021 9:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
another question, whats the exact input size in transactions? is there allowed to have transactions with hundreds or thousands of inputs?


[06/02/2021 9:37 PM] morphic#4133
What is the type of variable x? What you mean by "arbitrary number"?


[06/02/2021 9:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
lets say its long and is the value in R5 of an input box. lets have 15 for K.


[06/02/2021 9:40 PM] morphic#4133
INPUTS(1).R5[Long].get % K should work


[06/02/2021 9:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
neat. I assumed % is not valid due to computational reasons. its not in lang spec neither.


[06/02/2021 9:43 PM] morphic#4133
There is no limit on the number of inputs other than the index must be Int. However, the size of the input collection is multiplied by 2000 and that is added to the block validation cost which is accumulated towards maxBlockCost limit (currently 7000000)

It can fail sometimes during an oracle refresh because there's no slippage in the UI - 

https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/oracle-pool-state/ergusd


[06/04/2021 7:12 PM] LeggoMyErgo#4477
So just wait it out? Erg sent from wallet, just didn't  mine yet ? It will either bounce back or go through? Weird doesn't show up on dashboard this time as pending


[06/04/2021 7:20 PM] glasgowm#9381
Are you sure it's left? Check the explorer

1st "to address" has mu unspent erg with 26 confirmations


[06/04/2021 7:24 PM] glasgowm#9381
Is your erg visible in an address that doesn't start with a `9`


[06/04/2021 7:24 PM] LeggoMyErgo#4477
Correct


[06/04/2021 7:25 PM] glasgowm#9381
They might be stuck in the proxy address. To refund use this

https://assm.sigmausd.io/return/your_address_set_in_ui/the_long_address_you_sent_to


[06/04/2021 7:25 PM] LeggoMyErgo#4477

[06/04/2021 7:26 PM] LeggoMyErgo#4477
How do I use that?


[06/04/2021 7:27 PM] LeggoMyErgo#4477
Just white page with success false, detail...etc


[06/04/2021 7:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
you substitute the addresses in the link `your_address_set_in_ui` , etc


[06/04/2021 7:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
so the address you in your connected wallet on sigmausd


[06/04/2021 7:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
and the address you sent to


[06/04/2021 7:29 PM] LeggoMyErgo#4477
Hmmm the amount address my receiving address?


[06/04/2021 7:29 PM] LeggoMyErgo#4477
Sorry not technical


[06/04/2021 7:30 PM] glasgowm#9381
`your_address_set_in_ui` = the one set in sigmausd when you hit connect wallet. If you go to that page you can copy it out


[06/04/2021 7:30 PM] glasgowm#9381
`the_long_address_you_sent_to` - should start with some number other than 9


[06/04/2021 7:30 PM] glasgowm#9381
you can get that from yoroi or the explorer


[06/04/2021 7:31 PM] glasgowm#9381

[06/04/2021 7:40 PM] glasgowm#9381
If you mean from sigma then yeh there's a 4.5% fee when you go both ways

Thank you Glasgow, going to pinn that address. Cheers!

Hard to see what you're doing. 2nd line in your wallet is normally the unspent amount returned to your wallet - or maybe a rounding error in explorer. You don't need to calculate anything.


[06/05/2021 12:26 AM] nitram147#5106
@glasgowm Probably we should introduce something like FAQ feature on the sigmausd site, and make a simple formular where would user enter these two addresses and it will sent the GET request to assm api to refund it 🙂

That would be awesome

Does this api endpoint check when was the funds sent to the proxy address? Otherwise the whale can abuse it to DoS the sigmausd.io 🙁 (The recipient address is encoded in the proxy smart contract so whale can extract it from the corresponding ErgoTree) @anon_real


[06/05/2021 8:05 AM] anon_real#2768
DoS the sigmausd.io?
The proxy contract is a separate entity form Bank contract, can you elaborate?


[06/05/2021 8:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
is there any random generator in ergoscript?


[06/05/2021 8:31 AM] morphic#4133
No, ErgoScript execution should always be deterministic. I remember this question was already discussed somewhere here. Search in #🛠│development and other dev channels.

In case that the HTTP GET call to the before mentioned "assm" API, will return funds without any checks (that it won't check how old the transaction sent to the proxy smart contract is), and just construct and sign refunding transaction with assemblernode PK. Then the bearwhale can code simple script which will find every UTxO which belongs to the some sigmausd proxy smartcontract (large part of ErgoTree is the same, difference is only pubkey of destination user & timestamp inserted - so you can write simple regex checking proposition bytes of UTxOs to find all boxes which are locked by sigmausd.io proxy smartcontract). Bearwhale will then extract the P2S address of this boxes and the corresponding user pubkeys of destination user and make tupples from it. For each tupple will bearwhale call "assm" API's refund endpoint with two parameters from the obtained tupple. "assm" endpoint will then instantly issue sign and relay return transactions to the network. If the return transaction will be mined earlier, it will prevent mining of the minting transactions which will result in DoS. I hope you got my idea. So my question was whether the "assm" API is checking the transaction age before issuing refund transaction 🙂


[06/05/2021 10:20 AM] nitram147#5106
I meaned that it will DoS the proxy contracts as mentioned in my first response. Of course user will be able to construct transaction itself and use bankbox. However the majority of users are using sigmausd.io interface and proxy smart contracts.


[06/05/2021 10:57 AM] anon_real#2768
@nitram147 I get your point but that won't work in practice. First of all, the so-called API only works for the mined UTXOs, not off-chain ones. The minting transaction is generated very soon after the user sends funds. So the attack you explained only works if user tx is mined but the minting/redeeming is not and after that, the whale calls the API. But even in that case, miners have already assembled the next block and are trying to mine it and whale's tx is not in the block for sure and the minting/redeeming tx probably is. But again, even if it is not the case (minting/redeeming tx is not in the next block) then for the next block there is a fair chance that the minting/redeeming tx is invalid whatsoever whether because bank box is spent or oracle data has changed. So in summary, it is very unlikely for the proposed attack to work.


[06/05/2021 10:57 AM] anon_real#2768
Anyway, with dApp connector, soon there won't be any such dramas at all.


[06/05/2021 4:08 PM] nitram147#5106
Yeah, I know that there isn't 100% chance of success but there is at least a little, that why I asked. Did your backend scan for the unconfirmed UTxO to the proxy address and assemble minting/redeeming transaction and publish it even instantly, or does it firstly wait for the user funds to proxy UTxO to confirm? 🙂


[06/05/2021 4:11 PM] nitram147#5106
Yeah, this should definitely solve the problems. However I still like proxy contracts idea (it's novel to me), because user can use any wallet (even a mobile one in case there will be some) and it will work 😊 So keeping support for proxy contracts it's imho needed. How it will work in case of dApp connector with spending bank box - will the app scan for the unconrfimed redeem/minting UTxOs to build a spending transaction upon them, so they all can be minted in the same block? 🙂


[06/05/2021 5:46 PM] anon_real#2768
As I said, the minting/redeeming tx is assembled almost instantly after the user sends funds and that is why the proposed attack won't work at all (effectively).


[06/05/2021 5:49 PM] anon_real#2768
Yes, proxy contracts are more general.
Yes, the assembler works with offchain boxes which usually results in user funds' tx and the assembled tx to be mined in the same block.

guys, is someone ehre using this: https://github.com/mhssamadani/ErgoStratumServer ? I'm trying to make an pool with that but no success (clients are not connecting with it even using stratum proxy). I've already made the port forwards and it connects to the full node in beginning butseems to dont sync when the node detects a new block in the network

@lpsdamaceno there is an error with your node. but when stratum pool want to log your error raise another internal error. 
please pull latest version of pool and resend error in log.

no any log about this at logs


[06/08/2021 12:44 PM] andee#4722
have you checked nginx logs? can it be a problem with headers?


[06/08/2021 12:46 PM] [Dev] Alex#5249
not have any error

so problem is nginx


[06/08/2021 12:47 PM] zargarzadehmoein#2928
set domain for that with ssl?


[06/08/2021 12:47 PM] [Dev] Alex#5249
no ssl no domain


[06/08/2021 12:47 PM] [Dev] Alex#5249
just ip


[06/08/2021 12:49 PM] [Dev] Alex#5249
ok


[06/08/2021 12:49 PM] [Dev] Alex#5249

[06/08/2021 12:50 PM] [Dev] Alex#5249
nginx config work only if

```
location / {
                              proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9053;

              }```


[06/08/2021 12:50 PM] [Dev] Alex#5249
and then indicate port at server ip:port


[06/08/2021 12:50 PM] [Dev] Alex#5249
omg


[06/08/2021 12:51 PM] kushti#0978
heh


[06/08/2021 12:51 PM] [Dev] Alex#5249
probably some verification at node code?


[06/08/2021 12:51 PM] [Dev] Alex#5249
first time have this issue with nginx


[06/08/2021 12:58 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
Good morning! Any tip of what is wrong with stratum server? Thanks!


[06/08/2021 1:01 PM] vorujack#1729
It seems your proxy can not connect to node.can you check connection?


[06/08/2021 1:18 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
The proxy on the remote computer you mean? Or the local stratum server?


[06/08/2021 1:20 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
It seems that the proxy cannot connect to the stratum port but, Ive already opened the necessary ports on my router


[06/08/2021 1:20 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
That was 30032 and 30256


[06/08/2021 1:20 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
Should I also open port to the node in this case?


[06/08/2021 1:36 PM] zargarzadehmoein#2928
no need but i think there is a problem between your router and stratum server or didn't open ports


[06/08/2021 1:40 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
is there any changing like local ip i should modify in the stratum server side, for example to run it in the eth0 instead run at localhost?


[06/08/2021 2:04 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362

Hi, I have some EFYT in my waves wallet, is it possible to convert?


[06/08/2021 3:13 PM] glasgowm#9381
There's a EFYT/ERG pair on waves I believe


[06/08/2021 3:14 PM] 3rd#6931
direct 1 for 1?


[06/08/2021 3:14 PM] 3rd#6931
but....


[06/08/2021 3:14 PM] 3rd#6931
does that give me the real token?

[06/08/2021 3:59 PM] zargarzadehmoein#2928
yeah now this problem there is in stratum server
in a bit time node return a 500 error `Skipping candidate generation, one is already in progress`  /mining/candidate now stratum don't handle this error and we try to solve this problem ASAP but this problem does not prevent the work process stratum server.


[06/08/2021 4:30 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
Is there any special setting that should be done at start.js? I've already configured ports and wallet. Anything related to the network card IP?


[06/08/2021 11:06 PM] kushti#0978
yes, on EFYT/ERG pair, there's a buy order there


[06/09/2021 3:32 PM] 3rd#6931
so ERG is a coin on the WAVES platform?


[06/09/2021 3:39 PM] 3rd#6931
there is no EFYT/ERG pair, im looking at the waves exchange now


[06/09/2021 3:41 PM] 3rd#6931
how do i convert my EFYT into ERG and put in a wallet?


[06/09/2021 3:47 PM] andee#4722
there is a EFYT/WAVES pairing


[06/09/2021 3:48 PM] 3rd#6931
i know, but i want to convert the EFYT token into a ERG token 1 for 1


[06/09/2021 3:48 PM] 3rd#6931
and put it in the wallet


[06/09/2021 3:48 PM] 3rd#6931
how do i do that


[06/09/2021 3:51 PM] andee#4722
I don't know of any way to do a 1:1, on waves you have to sell for waves, then buy erg with waves


[06/09/2021 3:52 PM] 3rd#6931
what was the point of the airdrop if it isn't one for one?


[06/09/2021 3:52 PM] 3rd#6931
this token EFYT which was airdropped is literally useless


[06/09/2021 3:56 PM] andee#4722
last price EFYT/WAVES was .645, last price ERG/WAVES was .5. So that would equal 1.29ERG per EFYT. But the liquidity seems low


[06/09/2021 3:57 PM] 3rd#6931
yer no kidding, what is function does this coin? where does it get its value?


[06/09/2021 3:59 PM] andee#4722
seems like the payment gateway is not supported by waves anymore


[06/09/2021 3:59 PM] 3rd#6931
um what?


[06/09/2021 3:59 PM] andee#4722
the system that was used for exchanging 1:1


[06/09/2021 3:59 PM] 3rd#6931
yer i know


[06/09/2021 8:24 PM] Pharotek#2932
how are people setting up NBminer on Hivos? its not an option in dropdown

[06/09/2021 11:11 PM] kushti#0978
put manually "EFYT/ERG" into search bar, waves exchange is hiding the pair otherwise ((


[06/10/2021 11:28 AM] 3rd#6931
after i do so, what do I do with the ERG token?


[06/10/2021 11:31 AM] glasgowm#9381
Withdraw to yoroi or set up a full node. Ledger support underway


[06/10/2021 11:31 AM] 3rd#6931
so ERG is token on top of waves or it has it's own blockchain?


[06/10/2021 11:32 AM] glasgowm#9381
It's own blockchain - they're both based on ScoreX I believe


[06/10/2021 11:33 AM] 3rd#6931
but there is no gateway right? so how do i send it to my wallet?


[06/10/2021 11:33 AM] glasgowm#9381
There's a Gravity integration happening which is done by people from waves (not sure the exact relationship to waves there either)


[06/10/2021 11:33 AM] glasgowm#9381
you just withdraw - not sure what you mean


[06/10/2021 11:34 AM] 3rd#6931
gravity integration means gateway?


[06/10/2021 11:34 AM] glasgowm#9381
It's a gateway-like thing that connects oracles. Not sure what you mean by gateway.


[06/10/2021 11:35 AM] 3rd#6931
i see


[06/10/2021 11:35 AM] glasgowm#9381

```
Ergo’s Oracle Pools have also been embodied by Gravity Protocol. The partnership agreement was also an essential step in connecting the Waves and EMURGO Research & Development departments, pushing forward eUTxO research for the ecosystem as a whole. Ergo and Waves have always had a strong relationship, with Ergo’s First Year Token initially being released on the Waves blockchain. Ergo Core Developer Alex Chepurnoy and Sasha Ivanov, the founder of Waves, had collaborated in the past, and Waves was always a firm supporter of Ergo’s development. 

So far, the concepts implemented in Ergo seem complex, multi-layered algebraic abstractions and are somewhat difficult for developers to grasp, however, it’s precisely this radically new perspective that helps create innovative protocols and might be essential in solving problems in decentralized systems and improving them, be that architecture of a blockchain network or a network of oracles.

[06/11/2021 2:30 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
@zargarzadehmoein any though about that?


[06/11/2021 4:18 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
Ok... Now i have something:


[06/11/2021 4:19 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
i've ran the proxy in the localhost, in the same machine of the Stratum server.

[06/11/2021 4:19 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
Ive already done that:


[06/11/2021 4:20 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp -d 192.168.0.110/24 --dport 3000 -j DNAT --to-destination 127.0.0.1:3000


[06/11/2021 4:20 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
that forwards ethernet connections to the lopcalhost address.


[06/11/2021 4:20 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
i've already openened the port on my router forawarding it do the server too.


[06/11/2021 4:20 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362

(i've already tried to run server as root)


[06/11/2021 4:31 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
these two different nmaps is from different machines. In the left, an other machine doeing nmap inside lan to the proxy ip. In the right, the machine of the proxy server doeing the same nmap to its ip.

[06/11/2021 4:34 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
if i go to web browser and put my ip (192.168.0.110:3000) it gives me an page with "status fail" wich i interpretate as an message and successfull connection to the program.


[06/11/2021 4:35 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
but if i do the same in another machine inside LAN  it gives nothing. Simplily doesnt connect.


[06/11/2021 5:36 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
Ok... Now i get it, i need to manually open the port in my local machine that runs the server. Openning it i can connect remotely to the stratum server


[06/11/2021 5:36 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
but there is other problems:


[06/11/2021 5:37 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
i'm using same wallet for all settings

now i get it the meaning of "this is only a proxy"... NBminer supports stratum protocol.


[06/11/2021 5:48 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
connected well.


[06/11/2021 5:48 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
just openened the stratum port and enabled it manually in my machine and then connected.


[06/11/2021 5:53 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362

You probably followed the video tutorial posted in the auction house channel. It is outdated for the newest version. When creating on ergo utils there will be a checkbox labeled upload artwork. If you click that the image will show in the auctionhouse

[06/12/2021 2:22 PM] andee#4722
@Zteelh its not for viewing it, but to input the seed and get a confirmation if it matches the wallet


[06/12/2021 2:22 PM] andee#4722
what you posted a screenshot of is example output


[06/12/2021 2:23 PM] Zteelh#5292
ok, its possible to view my mnemonic again?


[06/12/2021 2:25 PM] andee#4722
not that I know of


[06/12/2021 2:27 PM] Zteelh#5292
oh well I guess i will have to make another wallet then, it seems I maybe mix the mnomonics so what i imported to yoroi I have no idea what the original wallet was, thx for answer


[06/12/2021 2:28 PM] andee#4722
you can check if its correct though, that's what it is used for


[06/12/2021 2:29 PM] andee#4722
if its correct it returns "matched": true


[06/12/2021 2:30 PM] Zteelh#5292
in what option I can do that?


[06/12/2021 2:32 PM] andee#4722
Click 'Try it out' and then input mnemonic and pass

kk thx, this wallet node is over complicated remembers me a lot the old schools wallets, thx for the help


[06/12/2021 2:34 PM] andee#4722
its not really for the average user, its for people that need a local node that can be accessed via an API


[06/12/2021 2:34 PM] andee#4722
is there a reason you stopped using yoroi?


[06/12/2021 2:43 PM] Zteelh#5292
well at least this one have an UI 😛 that old ones nop... About Yoroi i never liked that kind of plugins wallets


[06/12/2021 2:44 PM] andee#4722
use a separate browser that you don't install sketchy extensions to then live stress free? 🙂


[06/12/2021 2:44 PM] andee#4722
I know its not optimal, but from what I have seen there is a desktop wallet in the works

Getting ung up on API key, Ive got the wallet up, web interface going, When I try to use my API key it tells me "Bad API Key" did  make it too short or something ( its more than just Hello and is alphanumeric


[06/14/2021 9:35 AM] Gazza_SP#5835
Did you restart your full node after updating your API key? I had this issue and thats what solved it for me.


[06/14/2021 9:43 AM] Kultus#1594
apart from Closing the window as the video said to do, how do I shut it down ?


[06/14/2021 10:44 AM] Gazza_SP#5835
Ya once you close the powershell window and then run the start script again that's all you need to do. Did it help?


[06/14/2021 12:32 PM] Kultus#1594
it pointed me in the right direction, seems this nub had 2 version of the conf open and I was saving to the wrong one lol @Gazza_SP  cheers mate

[06/14/2021 12:34 PM] Kultus#1594
now I have another issue, but all in all wallet is up and going, but when I made my wallet it returned a time out error on the API and didn't feedback my mnemonic  phrase, is there a way to retrieve it


[06/14/2021 12:34 PM] Kultus#1594
of course I dont want a wallet I can't restore, so If need be I'll remake it, but hopeful there is a quick way to get access to it


[06/14/2021 2:49 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
There's no way to retrieve the mnemonic I believe, it's derived from your secret key somehow so if you didn't get it, I think you have to setup a new one!

Hi, I transferred some ERG to WAVES  to provide liquidity on the USDN/ERG pool they have there.  My transaction is complete on the ERGO side, but funds have not appeared in my WAVES wallet.  I've previously sent a smaller amount successfully.  Is there an expected time delay on the gateway with WAVES Exchange?


[06/14/2021 3:25 PM] andee#4722
most exchanges requires x confirmations before its deposited to your account. this should be in #💰│trading btw, this is ergo support not waves


[06/14/2021 3:58 PM] thatexactmike#4716
OK.  thanks.


[06/14/2021 4:01 PM] thatexactmike#4716
Trading seems to be all about price discussion, however, and this is a support question, not a question about trading ERGO for something else.  I've sent ERG to another ERG address and the ERG is not appearing there yet.  I get that my issue is going to be a joint effort between WAVES exchange and ERGO, but it is a technical issue not a trading issue.


[06/14/2021 4:03 PM] andee#4722
@thatexactmike sure, but it is exchange related. if they don't appear in your exchange wallet there is no support to get here. you will need to either ask waves or someone that uses waves and has deposited to them before


[06/14/2021 4:03 PM] andee#4722
depositing to an exchange is related to trading


[06/14/2021 4:04 PM] thatexactmike#4716
understand, I've initiated a support request with Waves exchange as well.


[06/14/2021 4:04 PM] andee#4722
I know some places needs 100 confirmations before they deposit to exchange wallet, some require less, some may require more


[06/14/2021 4:42 PM] thatexactmike#4716
Just a follow up here.  there are issues with the gateway on the Waves exchange side and they expect to have them resolved in about 24-36 hours.  Per their support, transferred funds will be credited when the issue is resolved.

[06/15/2021 6:27 PM] Busata#9432
mm, when launching a ergo node for the first time it seems to sync but I can't access the api wsoe.. I do see some stacktraces when launching it (one for swaggerconfig, the other for wallet secret key), but perhaps those are common if api key is not set yet, any other common issues? I'm trying to curl to it from the machine I've installed it on


[06/15/2021 6:28 PM] Busata#9432
the conf is the default one from the wiki


[06/15/2021 7:04 PM] Busata#9432
so, assume the first one is ok, the swagger one seems related to the api so not sure what's happening there

[06/15/2021 7:33 PM] Busata#9432
seems to be an encoding issue, doesn't seem to resort to utf-8 by default for some reason, weird since it's a clean ubuntu install


[06/15/2021 11:15 PM] andee#4722
@Busata what do you have in your config?


[06/15/2021 11:16 PM] Busata#9432
just had the default mining=false , but launching the jar with -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 seems to fix the issue, not sure why


[06/15/2021 11:17 PM] Busata#9432
from what I understand it's failing to read the swagger yaml correctly & not launching the api due to that, cause that's what the second trace seems about


[06/15/2021 11:20 PM] andee#4722
```ergo {
    node {
        mining = false
    }
}
```
or `ergo.node.mining = false` ?


[06/15/2021 11:20 PM] Busata#9432
the first


[06/15/2021 11:21 PM] andee#4722
just had to confirm you didn't have just mining=false 🙂


[06/15/2021 11:24 PM] Busata#9432
guess my locale isn't setup correctly on that server, from what I read, jvm picks up the wrong one as default & probably tries to read the yaml in something else than UTF-8, hence my fix working


[06/15/2021 11:24 PM] Busata#9432
weird cause I've run a node before with the same image but eh

I'm running the current version of java 16.0.1 (maybe that's the problem). I am only in the initial stages of setting up a node. However, although I am following the setup instructions perfectly (except for the recommended version of java) I am getting the error: "Unable to access jarfile ergo-4.0.12". Has anyone else had this problem?


[06/21/2021 9:28 PM] ziggomatic#9335
what os are you running? what's the md5/shasum of your jar? are you appending '.jar' to 'ergo-4.0.12', so 'ergo-4.0.12.jar'?

[06/23/2021 4:17 PM] andee#4722
@Len Grace you do not earn ERG running a node


[06/23/2021 4:49 PM] TradeMyWhat#5011
what is the point of running the node then? @andee


[06/23/2021 4:58 PM] andee#4722
@TradeMyWhat to have a copy of the blockchain locally, which has a lot of use cases. helping others sync their node faster, solo mining, or running a pool. people running nodes also increases decentralization of the ledger


[06/23/2021 4:59 PM] andee#4722
you don't receive any bitcoin for running a bitcoin node, you get no eth for running an ethereum node


[06/23/2021 5:04 PM] TradeMyWhat#5011
@andee yeah definitely understand the benefits for the ledger. Could you expand a bit on how it helps with solo mining please?


[06/23/2021 5:08 PM] andee#4722
@TradeMyWhat you need to run a node for solo mining, without it you have no way to provide the solution for the block or provide the miner with anything to hash


[06/23/2021 5:11 PM] TradeMyWhat#5011
@andee what if you are using HiveOs to solo mine with GPU?


[06/23/2021 5:12 PM] andee#4722
you still need a node, unless you solo mine to a pools node


[06/23/2021 5:13 PM] andee#4722
proper solo mining requires running a node


[06/23/2021 5:13 PM] TradeMyWhat#5011

[06/24/2021 10:17 PM] arokace#8057
Don't think there is.  Think your syncing might have screwed up.  It should take 4-6hours but certainly not all day.  So you might need to restart from the beginning

OK thanks I'll restart it in the morning. See if it's any quicker


[06/25/2021 12:04 AM] s0litaire#6951
does it need any specific ports open?


[06/25/2021 12:04 AM] arokace#8057
when ever its going you can see what block its currently on.  You'll see a pattern as the text flies by and you'll see a number in there that keeps on growing.  It needs to get to the current block height twice, onces for sync and once for something with the UTXO


[06/25/2021 12:05 AM] arokace#8057
no, not that I'm aware of

After this I open amdvbflashWin.exe, loading modded bios than program it. After this I reboot my PC.
Than I run atikmdag-patcher getting "driver successfully patched" and than the system reboots but when I go back to the device manager I get error code 3.
I am doing it with only 1 GPU.
I will be grateful if someone can help me 3 days in a row same thing.

Just to be sure: what is the reason u want a full node?


[07/08/2021 8:18 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
Yes I did


[07/08/2021 8:18 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
So I can support network and have wallet

In future plan to possibly  mine once I stop mining eth


[07/08/2021 8:20 AM] Awdi4Life#9782

[07/08/2021 8:26 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
but i get confused he says at 1:37 min he said paste the ergo file he downloaded and he didn't download anything


[07/08/2021 8:27 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
the last file downloaded was the ergo client release


[07/08/2021 8:27 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
i have the ergo folder created with the jar file in it

just read the guide and everything will be clear


[07/08/2021 8:29 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
but i am confused when he pasted those other folders where he got them from i started on the next step creating the config file tho but i missed that step where he moved the folders its confusing where he moved them from


[07/08/2021 8:30 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
cuz the last file he downloaded was the ergo client release then all sudden he addes files to the ergo folder when he didn't download anything


[07/08/2021 8:30 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
obviously not


[07/08/2021 8:32 AM] andee#4722
@Awdi4Life you are talking about problems understanding the video


[07/08/2021 8:32 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
no


[07/08/2021 8:32 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
read what i said at 1 min 37 seconds he pastes files in the folder and i have no clue where he got them from


[07/08/2021 8:33 AM] andee#4722
there is nothing written about moving anything in the guide


[07/08/2021 8:33 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
its in the video


[07/08/2021 8:33 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
1:37


[07/08/2021 8:34 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
its actually at 1:52


[07/08/2021 8:34 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
he says "i'll paste that ergo file i downloaded"


[07/08/2021 8:34 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
and he didnt download anything


[07/08/2021 8:34 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
the last file downloaded was the ergo release client


[07/08/2021 8:35 AM] andee#4722
its the node


[07/08/2021 8:35 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
see my screenshot


[07/08/2021 8:35 AM] andee#4722
download node, put in folder, make config, run


[07/08/2021 8:35 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
but at 152 he moves other folders to the ergo folder


[07/08/2021 8:36 AM] andee#4722
no, he showed the folder after having run the node. you can see him pasting the jar, it becomes blue because it gets selected


[07/08/2021 8:36 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
its the log.gz file


[07/08/2021 8:37 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
that im missing i dont see where he got it


[07/08/2021 8:37 AM] andee#4722
the text guide with screenshots is easier and faster, its very concise


[07/08/2021 8:38 AM] andee#4722
because you are not adding it, like I said he has already ran the node before capturing his screen there


[07/08/2021 8:38 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
well when i tried running the command it didnt go


[07/08/2021 8:39 AM] andee#4722
any error?


[07/08/2021 8:40 AM] andee#4722
you only need the jar and the config file


[07/08/2021 8:40 AM] andee#4722
and java ofc


[07/08/2021 8:42 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
it says unable to access jar file


[07/08/2021 8:43 AM] andee#4722
paste the cmd you use to run it

do a `ls`


[07/08/2021 9:11 AM] andee#4722
you are also missing the c in `-c`before the name of the config


[07/08/2021 9:14 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
huh


[07/08/2021 9:14 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
ls?


[07/08/2021 9:14 AM] andee#4722
write it in ps

why did you change the name of the jar? it has an added `.jar`

i thought that looked odd

[07/08/2021 9:21 AM] andee#4722
you also saved the config with the .txt extension


[07/08/2021 9:22 AM] andee#4722
so you need to add that to the run cmd aswell


[07/08/2021 9:29 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
it wont let me edit the file name


[07/08/2021 9:30 AM] Awdi4Life#9782

[07/08/2021 10:10 AM] Awdi4Life#9782

Is anyone else having troubles with sending ERG on Yoroi? I've tried 4 times to send some ERG between my wallets but there's no transaction going through and the spending password is correct


[07/10/2021 7:23 AM] burnysizzz#0822
I haven’t got any erg to send myself but about a month ago yoroi had issues over a whole weekend was resolved Sunday afternoon to evening


[07/10/2021 7:30 AM] godsendtoxic#7683
Strange, glad to know that it was resolved in the end but I've never had a problem like this


[07/10/2021 7:30 AM] godsendtoxic#7683
Wonder if it had anything to do with the new update?


[07/10/2021 7:26 PM] sk1llah#6246
Hello there! 
I have a problem, a transaction was sent to me today at 18:17 and it still shows as "unconfirmed"  Also, I cannot find it on any of the blocks around that time stamp. Any help? 🙂

[07/10/2021 11:06 PM] ShhNoGoat#5173
Anyone having issues trying to send from Yoroi to an exchange?  it shows the check mark, next screen it shows balances in red and then after i hit submit it takes a second and goes back to the wallet where nothing happens.

Could it be that there is a minimum?


[07/10/2021 11:08 PM] godsendtoxic#7683
Try sending it to another one of your wallets if you have one for a sanity check, my Yoroi hasn't been processing my transactions since my last message


[07/10/2021 11:08 PM] godsendtoxic#7683
One other person DMed me with a similar problem but no solution


[07/10/2021 11:09 PM] ShhNoGoat#5173
its weird, no matter what i do.. same same


[07/10/2021 11:10 PM] ShhNoGoat#5173
once i get my payment out i might have to dig for a new wallet

There is mempool congestion, waiting to fix in node's block candidate generation.

100% does or when you press send it does nothing but says it did..


[07/11/2021 1:55 AM] godsendtoxic#7683
Yeah I put in my spending password in and it looks like it works but no transactions take place. No error messages either


[07/11/2021 1:56 AM] ShhNoGoat#5173
same thing, at first i was like so... did it work? or not.


[07/11/2021 3:01 AM] Apextheory#6577
It does not show up in Yoroi until your transaction is mined and part of a block


[07/11/2021 3:01 AM] Apextheory#6577
But you can look for your "pending" transaction in the mempool here https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/mempool


[07/11/2021 3:01 AM] Apextheory#6577
As you can see, there is congestion right now, not sure the cause.

If had over 40-50 transactions with them and of course when i get the biggest bag ever, it happens. I'm a little nervous that CoinEx is based in HK and I've heard horror stories about their terrible customer service over on their subreddit


[07/16/2021 12:32 AM] andee#4722
I would start by trying to contact them directly. and double checking the tx you sent


[07/18/2021 9:46 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
I had a failed withdrawal with coinex and support fixed it 3 hours after I raised a ticket, they seem to be pretty helpful in general so I wouldn't panic yet if you sent to the correct address.

NP. the trick is knowing that the auction address is an input and output, and holds the NFT until it ends.


[07/27/2021 10:12 PM] Foeniculum#3278
Yeah I realised that the transaction shown when clicking on one of the histogram columns on the details page shows the *outbidded* persons' address and not the outbidder's

!!staking


[08/08/2021 3:52 PM] PhenoBot#9345
Ergo is a Proof of Work blockchain, rather than Proof of Stake. However there is a staking solution being worked using the tokenisation of dApps that is almost complete. 

The first implementation of this will be on #ergomixer - more details available here

A solution for staking
This topic proposes a solution for staking, which is not relying on data inputs and also scalable (can support thousands of tokens).  We consider the case of ErgoMixer, with profit from the mixer to be collected in a box associated with some “funding NFT” first. Then payments done periodically, in epochs (say, 1 epoch = 1,024 blocks). Epoch numb...

Yeh I had a similar issue a minute ago with sigmausd. Maybe something to do with a hashrate flux and the assembler. Seems to act up from time to time. I've said to Dev but if you try a few times or wait a bit, should go through.


[08/14/2021 10:14 AM] glasgowm#9381
I usually send at the same time when minting, spoke to @Foeniculum and he said 

The process is:
- Create auction
- Send ERG / token to the address (doesn't matter which one you send first)
- Wait for 1 confirmation (otherwise Yoroi will ignore that transaction. instead of "queuing it up")
- Send ERG / token to the same address (whichever wasn't sent the first time)

So that might be your issue

[08/14/2021 10:17 AM] Foeniculum#3278
If you HAVEN'T minted your NFT yet, you have to set up an auction first and then mint the NFT on ErgoUtils

If your NFT has already been minted, you don't need to use ErgoUtils and follow the steps in Glasgow's comment


[08/14/2021 12:01 PM] godded#6801
NFTs were already minted.
I figured it out I think. Apparently Yoroi always sends 0.011 ERG (or 0.01 ERG not sure, I'm not at my PC) with each NFT and the auction house seems to "expect" that you send your NFT from Yoroi. So it suggests 0.292 ERG + 0.011 ERG being sent with the Token => 0.303 ERG for the auction. However I was not sending from Yoroi, so my token didn't get sent with the "additional" 0.011 ERG and the contract conditions were not met.
I think this should be addressed on the auction house side, because it's basically assuming everyone is using a wallet that always attaches 0.011 ERG with the token transfer.


[08/14/2021 1:44 PM] godded#6801
Thank you. For taking the time and help me out with this.

Oh gotcha, I'm using Yoroi desktop extension but I thought the desktop one was the same!


[08/14/2021 2:09 PM] godded#6801
I'd have to get back on my PC to confirm, which I might be able to once I've put my kids to sleep (6 months and 3 years, might be a while).
But iirc when I sent a token via Yoroi I saw it automatically added 0.011 ERG with the transaction. I think 0.001 is the "intrinsic" ERG value of the token but it adds another 0.01 ERG (for whatever reason) this also seems to happen when you mint an NFT and send it.


[08/14/2021 2:26 PM] Foeniculum#3278
When you mint an NFT you can set that value to 0. Whatever amount of ERG you put in the box on ErgoUtils is gonna be sent to the minting address, so it's not actually something you're paying to mint


[08/14/2021 11:23 PM] godded#6801
Yeah I know, but when you send from Yoroi, I don't think you can change it. The 0.01 ERG just gets added to the transaction with the Token just before you enter your spending password and confirm it. 
And the auction house only tells you to send e.g. 0.292 ERG and the Token, which simply is not enough if you only send that exact amount. It has to be 0.302 ERG + Token to fulfill the contract, or like Yoroi does it 0.292 + (0.01 + Token).

[08/15/2021 5:43 AM] andee#4722
every wallet adds this fee, without it the transaction will not get mined


[08/15/2021 6:49 AM] godded#6801
Ergo wallet.io doesn't. It only adds 0.001 ERG as the mining fee. Which is fine. It's about the 0.01 ERG added to the transaction of the token (that's not a fee afaik)


[08/15/2021 6:50 AM] andee#4722
but the screen you posted shows only the fee added to the total


[08/15/2021 6:50 AM] godded#6801
I'm talking about the 0.01 ERG next to the exclamation mark in my screenshot, not the 0.0011 in fees


[08/15/2021 6:51 AM] andee#4722
oooh, just saw it


[08/15/2021 6:51 AM] andee#4722
didn't notice that the tx was for 1 erg


[08/15/2021 6:52 AM] godded#6801
So the transaction is actually a (1) token + 0.01 ERG and the fees are 0.0011 ERG


[08/15/2021 6:58 AM] godded#6801
It really makes sense, because my auction starting bid was 0.3 ERG, so the contract needs 0.302 ERG + the token. It is however a bit misleading if you don't use a wallet that does not add this 0.01 ERG to the transaction of the token automatically. Because if I transfer the token and then 0.292 ERG from the desktop wallet (ergowallet.io) then I never fullfil the contract and the auction does not get created.
I'm not sure when anon_real changed this, because when you look at the guide video about how to create auctions (I think the one with the ergo Christmas NFT) , the amount the auction house calls for is the exact amount of the starting bid, but nowadays it automatically asks for 0.01 ERG less, assuming it will get the 0.01 ERG from the token transaction anyway (which is the case on Yoroi)


[08/15/2021 7:00 AM] godded#6801
I would love to bring it up with him directly, but despite him posting on the ergo forums that people can DM him on Discord, I haven't seen him on this server yet, so I figured the best I can do is bring it up here in the support channel and pray someone with connections to him forwards the "issue"


[08/15/2021 7:09 AM] andee#4722
he is active here, but mostly in dev channels


[08/15/2021 7:10 AM] andee#4722

Ergowallet.io and Yoroi should both let you look through your different public addresses (derivation paths)

No idea, but the update this week said they were "close"


[08/21/2021 5:46 PM] zennethx#3207

[08/21/2021 6:47 PM] zennethx#3207
the mnemonic phrase I was using was for my first wallet node I had set up a while back
and somehow I never backed up my phrase from my last setup
so the address I was mining to is now just holding a few ERG as a lesson to me

Does ergo platform profitability calculator not take into account difficulty? https://ergoplatform.org/en/mining/ cause my 24H rewards (tested on herominers and nanopool) seem to be way off despite I am using the effective hashrate (in particular in nanopool I can see the effective average of the last 1,2,6,12,24 hours and I input a slightly lower value than I get from that into the ergo platform profitability calculator)  but the actual rewards are way off (lower) than what the calculator predicts


[08/21/2021 9:47 PM] godded#6801
Well there is luck (how many blocks did the pool actually find relative to it's, then current, hash rate and difficulty), dev fee (miner) and pool fee, so keep those in mind.
On both nanominers and 2miners I've had pretty spot on payouts based on https://ergoplatform.org/en/mining/ for my hash rate, taking fees into account on days with close to 100% (perfectly average) luck.
For herominers I've only tried that pool for a week, but it was consistently lower than what I expected for my hashrate (I think that's due their payment model and pool hoppers).
Woolypooly I've never given a fair shake, because of this https://woolypooly.medium.com/wooly-payment-distribution-system-d299cede9c9d
Since I only have one worker on ERG and not the most stable power grid, I didn't feel like being annoyed about loosing my 100% parcipitation (which apparently takes a few days to build up to full) everytime I have a connection drop or have to do rig maintenance.

short answer tho. The calculator on the website takes into account current difficulty. I'd also recommend this if you feel like having a way to predict the next few days for mining yields.

Hello, requesting help for wallet balance reporting 0 in full Ergo node.  Recently installed jar version 4.0.13, with node currently synced.  After entering API key wallet synced, shows correct address but has 0 balance in wallet.  I have checked explorer, balance still present.  I have tried several interventions including: deleting wallet then syncing node without API key in config file, followed by adding API to config after syncing.  Tried unlocking, locking repeatedly then restarting node.  No luck so far.  Any ideas?

Hi everyone! I am ethereum miner. However, i am eyeing mining ergo right now because it's impossible to buy a non lhr videocard. I found statistics of 3060 ti lhr on minerstat, which looks quite promising. Maybe by any chance you know anybody who actually mine ergo on lhr videocard? How many mgs of ergo do you get from lhr card? I have read that there are two generations of those cards, and second is blocked against ergo. Is it true?

Hi everyone, I have just now started mining Ergo, for a change,  after having been on ETH until now.
One thing I am noticing is that the miner (TRM on HiveOS n my case) keeps recreating tables after every few minutes during which the Hashrate drops to almost half & then it gets back to its peak again. This is cyclical & I am pretty sure it is going to affect my overall average hashrate.
Is there something that I am doing wrong of is it just the way Ergo mining works?
Doesn't this mean that whatever daily earning data is shown on whattomine for ergo is going to be substantially more than actual earnings due to this constant recreation of tables & fall in hashrate?

wondering if anyone here can help me with an nft question. i can't seem to find a way to link to a token directly in ergoexplorer. does ergo support linking directly to a token to see which wallet owns it?


[08/25/2021 11:26 AM] VT80#3189
You only can see the wallets public address and amount of tokens.


[08/25/2021 4:24 PM] NilsDougan#3073
So there's no way to see something like this in ErgoExplorer: https://etherscan.io/token/0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405?a=1865

you need to wait for the node to finish the scan

[08/26/2021 3:09 AM] andee#4722
stop node, delete `.ergo/{history,state}`start node and wait for resync if it doesn't work


[08/26/2021 3:14 AM] BuffNdaMuffN#4152
Should I be worried that node wallet balance reads 0?


[08/26/2021 8:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
I don’t think so


[08/26/2021 1:20 PM] BuffNdaMuffN#4152
So the node is fully synced buy the wallet seems to be stuck on active synchronization. I tried deleting .ergo/{history,state} but no luck.


[08/26/2021 3:19 PM] glasgowm#9381
you need to wait for it to sync - you can track on the panel or cli and compare against the explorer. 

If it's on active sync it's not fully sync'd what do you mean?


[08/26/2021 3:39 PM] BuffNdaMuffN#4152
In the past I don't remember the sync taking so long so I assumed it was maybe stuck in a loop or something. Didn't know I could track the progress of the sync. I'll have to look into it when I get back later today. Thanks.

Hi not sure if I'm writing in right location but I want to ask if anyone knows this.
Basically I found out that ergo network has a feature for stale wallets being taxed but does that also effect wallets that get deposits only or effects only those that don't get used at all. 🧐

[08/26/2021 7:51 PM] Alien Σ Crypto#4489
Ok yes every 4 years fee for but I'm still confused or not understand the difference between or if even there is a difference between wallets that are not used for 4 years and wallets that are used but only to hold erg. Basically if this makes any sense


[08/26/2021 7:52 PM] andee#4722
you can avoid if by sending your wallet balance to yourself every 3.5 years


[08/26/2021 7:52 PM] andee#4722
its not like it empties your wallet after 4 years, it a little every 4 years


[08/26/2021 7:54 PM] Alien Σ Crypto#4489
As an example right now I only have a wallet that I add erg from mining like 50% on my mining goes in to this wallet. But only transactions I make in that wallet are deposits


[08/26/2021 7:55 PM] andee#4722
when you get a deposit, that creates a box. after 4 years of not moving, that box will be charged storage rent unless you send all those boxes to yourself


[08/26/2021 7:56 PM] Alien Σ Crypto#4489
Actually I don't mind fees but I wanted to be clear as to how it works. Thanks for clearing that up. 👆


[08/26/2021 7:57 PM] andee#4722
you get around this by sending your whole wallet balance to yourself. that consolidates all those boxes to one new box


[08/26/2021 7:58 PM] Alien Σ Crypto#4489
Ok, but I think I would rather pay fee and not risk losing and or exposing my wallet to outside world.


[08/26/2021 7:59 PM] Alien Σ Crypto#4489
In a way I'm treating my erg as I used to treat btc, store it till my retirement 😂

Anyone know about yoroi only allowing one transaction at a time? "
ATTENTION:
Cannot send a new transaction while an existing one is still pending."

is this just based on how the network works, with UTXO?

[08/27/2021 7:48 AM] RibDibBibarel#8625
I quintuple checked and I am 100% entering the correct IP address for my miner.


[08/27/2021 7:49 AM] RibDibBibarel#8625
I think there is something wrong with whatever y'all are using to check IP addresses because this one worked when I set up my settings.


[08/27/2021 7:54 AM] RibDibBibarel#8625
Nm, fixed. Had to use my desktop's IP address, Y'all need to fix this, because it does not actually check the miner's IP address.


[08/27/2021 7:59 AM] andee#4722
@RibDibBibarel Ergo does not operate any pools. as long as you mine at home your desktop IP will be the same as you have on your miner

So I transferred sigUSD back for a refund. I put in the address, amount of ERG was 0.01, 2500 sigUSD, and 0.01 fee. Looks like the refund failed and on the explorer its showing I now have 0.0088 ERG and 25 sigUSD. The SigUSD website shows the same. I hope I'm reading something wrong because I didn't send 438 ERG to redeem 2500 sigUSD. Any help?


[08/27/2021 2:06 PM] andee#4722

[08/27/2021 2:14 PM] BuffNdaMuffN#4152

can you try restoring the wallet in yoroi? yoroi should add it automatically

do i have to do anything on the node side?


[08/27/2021 2:45 PM] andee#4722
yoroi is a browser extension


[08/27/2021 2:46 PM] andee#4722
you could try deriving addresses using the api on the node, but its just so much easier to restore in yoroi and have it do it automatically


[08/27/2021 2:50 PM] BuffNdaMuffN#4152
so yoroi wallet is created. shows i have 0 ERG and somehow i sent 438 ERG this morning.

As far as I am seeing, only 25 SigUSD is sent and it is rejected and refunded to `9g9wU4kTMaKbQd3SLHCyQS8xcpTNysPfiLrWiFAX5uvMXsyE5R4`
The change (480 ERGs and 2475 SigUSD) is also sent to the change address `9eqHwBGhaafXgiyJhJDqFPezRvQye8DE8Cqw82c58p3ZBNnUhkB`


[08/27/2021 3:13 PM] anon_real#2768
If you can't see it in your Yoroi, maybe there are some issues on their side - not sure though.


[08/27/2021 3:13 PM] andee#4722
he was originally using the node


[08/27/2021 3:14 PM] andee#4722
I was thinking the same, but isn't it normal for the change to not be included in the amount?

So the best I can tell is when I tried to redeem sigUSD this morning my address( 9g9wU4kTMaKbQd3SLHCyQS8xcpTNysPfiLrWiFAX5uvMXsyE5R4 ) sent some amount of sigUSD( I typed 2500 but wallet shows 250000 as amount not sure why. Missing a decimal? "2500.00" ). Transaction failed and SigmaUSD refunded me. Somehow 438 ERG was sent to ( 9eqHwBGhaafXgiyJhJDqFPezRvQye8DE8Cqw82c58p3ZBNnUhkB ). My ERGO node wallet "seems" to see it but Yoroi and SigmaUSD.io do not. Not sure which to believe. When I link SigmaUSD.io with that second address the history matches the first address.

i placed a bid on https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/specific/8725b671aaf9cfc3421155a5a19c50510c2661c52ca80d48da05db9378b47409  like an hour ago

1.5 erg bid wallet jddq9 is mine


[08/31/2021 3:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
i know its completely my fault, but had lose 7.5 ergs minting/redeming sigrsv  and being scamed on my first try to buy a cool nft on ergo feels terrible bad 😭


[08/31/2021 1:14 PM] ppf#7249
is there an easy way to wipe a wallet (send all funds to a new wallet)? i always run into the input-limit (`boxes exceed max inputs in transaction`)


[08/31/2021 3:04 PM] ppf#7249
also i ran into this: `Failed to sign boxes due to Estimated execution cost 1001721 exceeds the limit 1000000` when I tried to send 100 boxes


[08/31/2021 3:05 PM] ppf#7249
I do not understand how I can calculate the fee, i would have to serialize the tx and then pass the size to the fee-endpoint?


[08/31/2021 4:23 PM] ppf#7249
i sorted my unspent boxes from max value to min and took the sum of the first 50 boxes, sending this sum to another address yields `Failed to find boxes to assemble a transaction`. am I misunderstanding something?

[09/01/2021 12:11 AM] JoeS71#3575
any ideas?

stop node, delete `.ergo/{history,state}` start node and wait for sync


[09/01/2021 12:23 AM] JoeS71#3575
is that the only way?  its takes long time to sync node!

Hey I've been stuck in active sync for about 24 hours+, is this normal?


[09/01/2021 5:45 AM] ZackVee#3617
Same with wallet so I cannot really access it at the moment 😗


[09/01/2021 5:45 AM] Chris Horticulturalist#2573
I have a problem with Yoroi showing only part of my SigRSV holdings say 1,100 in the select asset drop down box; ergo explorer reveals there's a actually larger balance of 11,100 on the same address. Sending an additional 1,000 increases Yoroi SigRSV balance to 2,100 and Ergo explorer shows 12,100.
Oddly there's an asset I have no idea about called OUROBOROS OMEGA listed under Select asset.

I have resynced the wallet along with removed and restored it...but to no avail. Anyone know how I can fix this & regain access to these inaccessible SigRSV?


[09/01/2021 6:27 AM] glasgowm#9381
Check height against explorer


[09/01/2021 6:33 AM] ZackVee#3617
I decided to ditch the node and just use a regular wallet

to the node


[09/03/2021 9:31 AM] iceM0nger#7828
Current height

459893


[09/03/2021 9:33 AM] andee#4722
that's pretty far behind. there is a fix upcoming for this in the next release


[09/03/2021 9:34 AM] andee#4722
the only way right now is to delete `.ergo/{state,history}` and start the node again

Just a sample of the output that's whizzing by after running the java config command.


[09/03/2021 7:27 PM] andee#4722
it should be receiving and applying modifiers


[09/03/2021 7:28 PM] Winston_1984 ! No DMs#4696
so does it always need to be running?


[09/03/2021 7:28 PM] andee#4722
no, only if you want it fully synced at all times


[09/03/2021 7:29 PM] andee#4722
the node interface should display current height


[09/04/2021 1:46 AM] Winston_1984 ! No DMs#4696
If I close the Java script window, then I can no longer access my local node.  BTW, it's still syncing?


[09/04/2021 3:44 AM] andee#4722
if its not running its not syncing

So I started mining ergo on a GTX 1060 3GB (because it was one of the only coins it could handle lol) and my Yoroi wallet doesn't seem to be receiving any funds. I'm using t-rex miner btw. Can anyone help with this?


[09/05/2021 5:24 AM] cambrule#9287
Are you mining on a pool? How long have you been mining for?


[09/05/2021 5:28 AM] cambrule#9287
If you’re solo mining with that card then you’ll have a very difficult time finding anything. Even if you’re on a pool, with that card, it’ll likely take a while to earn enough erg to see a payout. You can usually check the pools payout and your miners stats on their website.


[09/05/2021 5:56 PM] ThomasRhombas#7628
Im in a pool


[09/05/2021 7:06 PM] ThomasRhombas#7628
ohhhh my pool has a minimum payout of 1 erg so that must be why it wasnt working


[09/06/2021 5:24 AM] Mxsi/Maciej#1554
Yup, need to mine for couple of days, didnt use t rex, only teamredminer but probably works the same

guys... i'm having  a trouble with my api keys at ergo's node interface.


[09/10/2021 5:39 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
It shows "bad api key" now. It used to work before. i've already tried to change it but no success... Always bad api key.


[09/10/2021 5:39 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
any clue?


[09/10/2021 5:44 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
the last thing i've tried just now and seems to solve: remove all block database and resync the node. now i can access the wallet.

Can a wallet address be “retired”? As in no longer able to receive funds?

I have started an auction but can't see it in the Active Auction page!
Starting an auction is basically waiting for an transaction representing the auction to be mined. Depending on the network traffic, it may take a few minutes for the transaction to be mined and you see your auction. if you keep the app open, you will be notified about the status.


[09/12/2021 4:23 AM] Dacklin#2383
Hey guys it’s been almost to 2 hours and I can’t see my auction still


[09/12/2021 6:48 AM] andee#4722
have you checked if the tx got sent?


[09/12/2021 6:56 AM] Dacklin#2383
I just did it and all my assets got sent back to me @andee


[09/12/2021 6:58 AM] Dacklin#2383
@andee just to let you know there is a member in this community by the name sammy , he was pretending to be one of the community devs and try to help me out , but in return he was trying to get access to my wallet by making me install a multibridge dapp connector

@andee i see you are also here 😄 
Thanks mate, ill leave it running


[09/12/2021 11:38 PM] andee#4722

Should it be taking any power away from my pc? As my hash rate did drop a little now, by about 20 MH/s


[09/12/2021 11:40 PM] andee#4722
if its cpu mining its to be expected


[09/12/2021 11:40 PM] andee#4722
verifying the chain is cpu intensive


[09/12/2021 11:41 PM] KaZaK#4277
Hmm thought it was using my gpu, at least it should be


[09/12/2021 11:41 PM] KaZaK#4277

Im just trying to figure some figures out for costs of transactions and stuff, im hoping someone could help me, is there a rough figure say for right now, if i was to transfer 7 ERG from my ergo wallet to kucoin to sell, how much would that trans cost? Just the part from my wallet to kucoin, ive tried entering the transaction but obviously as i dont have the coin yet, it couldnt tell me


[09/13/2021 8:08 PM] andee#4722

Okay so im looking at the exchange of ergo to BTC on Kucoin as the exchange im using called CEX.io but the fee is $20 for transferring from kucoin to CEX.io, any advice on a cheaper method to turn this ergo into money? I would exchange it into USDT but cex.io says it needs to be on the ethereum network, which would involve quite high gas prices right? Which is what im trying to avoid


[09/13/2021 10:36 PM] KaZaK#4277
Sorry if thats no explained well, trying to wrap my head around it, TLDR how do i sell my ergo for money without it being too expensive

Would a PYN5 nvidia quadro p2000 5GB GDDR5 be a good card for mining ? More cad related software card. But thinking of trying to convince a family member to use his computer to mine in evenings ?


[09/14/2021 8:31 AM] KaZaK#4277
According to nicehash, you'll get around 1 euro per day with that card on ETH, so maybe use that as a ballpark figure?


[09/14/2021 8:32 AM] KaZaK#4277
Oh wait thats with the p2200


[09/14/2021 8:33 AM] KaZaK#4277
Theres no real way to know until you try it, but if the p2000 is worse then the p2200 youll be make a very small amount of money

Hi All, sorry if this question has been asked many times, to update ergo version do i just replace the jar file with the latest one?


[09/16/2021 6:19 PM] ziggomatic#9335
that should do it, yep


[09/16/2021 6:19 PM] Minde#4633
sweet, do you know if it will solve the many many days of active synchronization that i have been having?


[09/16/2021 6:20 PM] ziggomatic#9335
hehe not sure. might do


[09/16/2021 6:21 PM] Minde#4633
well one way to find out i guess. It's been doing my head in seeing it stuck at "Active synchronization" for the past week if not more.


[09/16/2021 6:26 PM] andee#4722
stop node, delete `.ergo/{history,state}`


[09/16/2021 6:26 PM] andee#4722
will have to resync, but it will most likely fix your problem


[09/16/2021 6:33 PM] Minde#4633
thanks, will give it a go


[09/17/2021 5:57 PM] Alien Σ Crypto#4489
So today I had a pay out from the pool but the funds never arrived what's the best way to track that? 3h later still nothing.


[09/17/2021 5:58 PM] Alien Σ Crypto#4489
I check the transaction from the pool and it's showing my wallet but my wallet has same amount and is missing the paid amount from today.


[09/17/2021 5:59 PM] Alien Σ Crypto#4489
Can anyone here maybe push me in right direction how I go about locating those.


[09/17/2021 5:59 PM] ziggomatic#9335
stick your address in https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/


[09/17/2021 6:01 PM] Alien Σ Crypto#4489
I checked and it's showing but the actual wallet is missing the funds

Maybe cause it's an exchange and it's hasn't updated it?


[09/17/2021 6:03 PM] ziggomatic#9335
ah so that's an exchange address?


[09/17/2021 6:03 PM] ziggomatic#9335
it may need a number of confirmations before it accepts


[09/17/2021 6:05 PM] ziggomatic#9335
apparently coinex only needs 15 confirmations

@Dmitry Usov Hi! I have just checked my PR and it has conflict with config.toml file but i believe it's only a new line. Should I resolve that in the github UI in the web or close the PR, pull the repo and merge it locally on my machine?


[09/18/2021 10:46 AM] Dmitry Usov#0134
I will fix it, no problem

I will check your pr today and if I will have any questions I will ask to you, not checked it yet 🙂

it is about some additional ERG strangely being sent to another address during a transaction, some kind of "change address" 🤔

[09/19/2021 9:10 PM] Tyreal#2040
thanks, that's helpful to understand what's going on and why 1 ERG went somewhere else during the transaction. How can I get hold of it though? In the node UI I do not see the address the coin went to, setting it up from scratch with a recovered wallet hasn't helped either. I was using ergo-4.0.10.jar before, I have used ergo-4.0.13.jar for the new node. Could this be a problem?


[09/19/2021 9:14 PM] andee#4722
shouldn't be. I don't know why the node would make a change address without showing it in the list of addresses though


[09/19/2021 9:15 PM] andee#4722
you should be able to access it when sending a transaction though


[09/19/2021 9:17 PM] Tyreal#2040
yes, I have actually seen that at a follow up transaction, ERG were sent from the change address. So I think it is a UI problem then, as it would not allow me to send more ERG than available in the primary address. Would setting up a "manual" transaction via Swagger be an option?


[09/19/2021 9:18 PM] Tyreal#2040
but looking at the Swagger route for this seems rather complicated, I am certainly not blockchain pro


[09/19/2021 9:19 PM] andee#4722
try `deriveNextKey` in swagger


[09/19/2021 9:20 PM] andee#4722
it will add an extra address to your wallet


[09/19/2021 9:20 PM] Tyreal#2040
ok will do one sec


[09/19/2021 9:21 PM] Tyreal#2040
that worked


[09/19/2021 9:22 PM] Tyreal#2040
however, weirdly enough it shows the new address twice in the addresses UI


[09/19/2021 9:22 PM] andee#4722
you can also use `/wallet/updateChangeAddress` to change it


[09/19/2021 9:22 PM] Tyreal#2040
will it transfer the ERG held by the current change address to the new one?


[09/19/2021 9:23 PM] andee#4722
no, not until you do a transaction and get change in return


[09/19/2021 9:24 PM] Tyreal#2040
I see. thanks for your help. I will try sending some ERG and see what happens. It is good to understand what's going on and know that the ERG is not lost


[09/19/2021 9:45 PM] ikar3m#9402
Guy’s do you think ergo on 17.5$ again tomorrow?


[09/19/2021 9:51 PM] vegycslol#1714
such questions belong in #💰│trading, try asking there


[09/20/2021 9:50 AM] Tyreal#2040
hey guys, follow up question on my issue with the change address: I am seeing this line in the node's log: `ErgoWalletState - Change address not specified. Using root address from wallet`
how can I specify the change address in the ergo config file? looking through github I found that WalletStorage seems to read it from `change_address`, but it is not clear to me where this key should be set in the config.


[09/20/2021 10:06 AM] andee#4722
you set it using the API


[09/20/2021 10:09 AM] Tyreal#2040
ok, I have tried that. It unfortunately does not make the change address appear in the UI addresses


[09/20/2021 10:10 AM] andee#4722
it won't make it appear, the address you change it to will be set as changeAddress on your transactions


[09/20/2021 10:11 AM] Tyreal#2040
understood


[09/20/2021 10:13 AM] Tyreal#2040
can I use the API route `/scan/addBox`  to make the node aware of ERG stored at the change address?


[09/20/2021 10:18 AM] andee#4722
you should be able to do that. a `/wallet/rescan` should also fix it, request will timeout


[09/20/2021 10:24 AM] Tyreal#2040
thanks, will give it a try


[09/20/2021 10:49 AM] Tyreal#2040
so that actually worked 👍 after doing the `/scan/addBox` request, the node was aware of the available balance and I could send it regularly via the UI.
I have a better understanding of the whole transaction/utxo concept in blockchains now. only thing still puzzling is why the node does not recognize the boxes by itself.
thanks for the help!


[09/20/2021 2:26 PM] joshu#5155
I may have posted in the wrong chanel. I've set up the node, and I'm wondering how long the initial sync lasts? It seems to be chewing up system resources while it syncs for the last 15 hours or so.


[09/20/2021 2:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
make sure it's syncing (height is increasing) - depends on computer speed/internet. 12-24hrs

{Reactions}
👍 

[09/20/2021 3:04 PM] joshu#5155
Yes, the height is increasing. I'll be patient then. Thanks for the expected eta.

Is there instruction for setting up behind a reverse proxy, specifically Nginx? My hope is to cloud host and secure this with keycloak. I was able to achieve a basic proxy, but the api key would not set.


[09/20/2021 3:19 PM] andee#4722

[09/20/2021 8:03 PM] joshu#5155
I'm supposed to use bindAddress in the config. I see 2 instances of this, scorex.restapi.bindaddress and network.bindaddress.

however regardless of how I set these it fails in a dozen ways. any guidance on the config file here? I feel like I'm missing something.


[09/20/2021 8:08 PM] andee#4722
what fails?


[09/20/2021 8:12 PM] joshu#5155
I'm binding to 127.0.0.3 with the ports respectively.

with only proxy_pass set to the same string and no other settings enabled it redirects to /swagger fr base url, but nginx gives 404


[09/20/2021 8:22 PM] joshu#5155
where can I find the actual locations for the port calls? eg, root url is clearly 9052. Is there a specific location that calls to 9020?


[09/20/2021 8:23 PM] joshu#5155
when I specifically set the port in nginx, it brings up swagger and panel.


[09/20/2021 8:23 PM] joshu#5155
but... I cannot set api key.


[09/20/2021 8:41 PM] andee#4722
the other port is for p2p communication between nodes


[09/20/2021 8:41 PM] andee#4722
you need to do `proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1;` and append the port to the url


[09/20/2021 9:06 PM] joshu#5155
in your example it is explained that it worked only after removing the port...?


[09/20/2021 9:07 PM] andee#4722
no port in nginx config


[09/20/2021 9:07 PM] andee#4722
but when accessing the node you need to use the port


[09/20/2021 9:07 PM] andee#4722
`http://server:port`


[09/21/2021 3:13 PM] DetroitIrish25#8815
Having issues restoring wallet. !fresh node install on new nachine.correct mnemonic and pass shows 0 balance and new address. Imported .json from backup (/wallet/keystore)and cleared history yields correct address but still 0 balance. Any help would be appreciated. I can see the correct balance if install Yoroi  and use same 15 char mnemonic and pass


[09/21/2021 3:26 PM] glasgowm#9381
is the node sync'd ?


[09/21/2021 3:28 PM] DetroitIrish25#8815
It has sync'd


[09/21/2021 3:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
height matches https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/ ?


[09/21/2021 3:28 PM] DetroitIrish25#8815
I backed everything up to a USB, can I just overwrite the wallet section?


[09/21/2021 3:29 PM] glasgowm#9381
should be fine yeah


[09/21/2021 3:29 PM] DetroitIrish25#8815
As of last night the height matched


[09/21/2021 3:30 PM] DetroitIrish25#8815
Anything else need to be done other than empty history?


[09/21/2021 3:30 PM] glasgowm#9381
If you use yoroi and send all assets into one box that might help


[09/21/2021 3:30 PM] glasgowm#9381
For what ?


[09/21/2021 3:30 PM] DetroitIrish25#8815
When I over write wallet


[09/21/2021 3:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
History and state are the sync I believe


[09/21/2021 3:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
It's just /wallet


[09/21/2021 3:31 PM] DetroitIrish25#8815
I don't use Yoroi, just downloaded to verify mnemonic was working correctly


[09/21/2021 3:32 PM] glasgowm#9381
I'm guessing your funds are in multiple addresses on yoroi?


[09/21/2021 3:32 PM] DetroitIrish25#8815
Single address


[09/21/2021 3:33 PM] glasgowm#9381
First check console for error messages etc.. if that doesn't help then reinitialize as follows
1. Fresh folder, don't copy any old data
2. Init wallet with mnemonic
3. Derive address while node is syncing
4. Wait for sync


[09/21/2021 3:35 PM] DetroitIrish25#8815

Hi. Any ideas on how to fix "Bad API key" error? I believe I'm entering the correct one (I just copy+paste the one that I've used for the last few months, including a few transactions last week). Updating from 4.0.12 to 4.0.13 didnt help


[09/21/2021 5:52 PM] luisriverag#0773
Sorted. Seems I just had to remove .ergo folder and sync again (I renamed it just to play safe). Thanks anyway!


[09/22/2021 7:47 AM] Bickleigh#8948
Hi guys, reaching out here for some help. I have an account with Bitcoin.com which I use as a proxy for Binance because Binance don't support ERGO. I have a couple of rig's mining on Herominers. I mine about 3 erg every 24hours and it is deposited into the Bitcoin.com account where it is converted to $ and then transfered to my Binance account. It has bee running smoothly for the last month. Last night, Herominer made a deposit of about 3 erg as usual, but it never arrived in my Bitcoin.com wallet.  I have a transaction ID and can see the entry in the ERGO explorer. I understood the deposits to bitcoin.com were received after 30 confirmations. This transaction is currently sat at 180 confirmations and counting. Not sure what to do here can't contact Bitcoin.com support. (thier contact system is broken, conveniently) and I have a transaction that has gone AWOL. Can anyone help?


[09/22/2021 8:11 AM] glasgowm#9381
Mining straight to exchanges can cause the wallet to break like this. Bitcoin.com are in the middle of some changes so most likely need to wait til their support system is back.


[09/22/2021 10:07 AM] Bickleigh#8948
Ok, thanks for the feedback

sounds like a corrupted DB - send logs to kushti and then delete and restart - I think there's a reward if it leads to catching any of the edge cases causing this.

[09/23/2021 5:41 PM] glasgowm#9381
yeah think they can be pretty big so you'll need to host them somewhere most likely


[09/23/2021 5:41 PM] glasgowm#9381

Hi guys im mining ERGO on hiveos but its paying out to nicehash, my profitability on nicehash shifts from £4-16 but tends to sit £10 or under. after checking a hashrate calculator, i hit 750 hashrate i should be earning around £13.5-14 Any advice? For example every 2 hours i should be mining £1.12 roughly but currently after 2 hours worth of mining i have earned around 80p. Please @ me if you're messaging me as ive asked in a few other discords

Is it possible to see transaction history from a desktop wallet? Talking about the node


[10/08/2021 4:33 AM] Att1Tude#4721
Available balance doesn't match

Anyone had the same problem with PICO?

Rig turning on (CPU & GPU fan spinning, and LED indicators turning on) but no display in monitor nor beep code using PICO board. Seller said it is possible that the PICO board is not compatible with my motherboard.

Also how much does a transaction usually take


[10/10/2021 8:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
yes


[10/10/2021 8:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
depends where to. 2m blocktime

However ergodex is giving me problems


[10/10/2021 8:25 PM] Stef#0241
It doesn't say transaction submitted


[10/10/2021 8:27 PM] glasgowm#9381
see discord server in #deleted-channel - you might need to refund it if the price changed too much

Yeah I'm in that server aswell


[10/10/2021 8:43 PM] Stef#0241
I managed to get the transaction processing but after a while I just got the erg back minus the fees


[10/10/2021 8:43 PM] Stef#0241
So the contract didn't go through?

The desktop wallet/node desperatly needs a complete UI/workflow makeover. I did get it up and running but I don't have time to tinker and tweak just to make it work. Desktop wallet i feel is required in order to get adoption. Desktop wallet with ledger support, now THERE is Utopia for ya! 🙂 Is that on the roadmap at all?


[10/18/2021 3:43 PM] glasgowm#9381
Not with ledger yet afaik but there's a couple different teams who are working on multiplatform wallets and armeanio is speaking to people at existing wallet solutions

I am trying to restore my Yoroi Wallet and for some reason it is only bringing back one address which I have used and that address was used to transfer only 34 ERG. All the rest of my ERG doesn't look to be coming through when restoring. Can anyone advise at all please?


[10/21/2021 7:47 PM] apexpool#3878
they don't appear when you click "Generate new address" in the "Receive" tab?


[10/21/2021 7:51 PM] RH#8045
hey buddy, do you if if we can call about this so I can explain it a little better? I'm just stressing a little right now @apexpool


[10/21/2021 7:53 PM] apexpool#3878
I am not an expert in Yoroi / ERG


[10/21/2021 7:53 PM] apexpool#3878
if you go to "Receive" tab and click on "Generate new address" it should generate the same addresses as you had before.


[10/21/2021 7:54 PM] apexpool#3878
if not.... I cannot help


[10/21/2021 7:55 PM] RH#8045
I cannot see that part as I removed the wallet so I need to restore it back first before I can view all the addresses etc. But when I need to verify the restoration of the wallet it only shows 1 address and i click on it and it takes me to ERGO Explorer where it only shows I have 34 ERG


[10/21/2021 7:56 PM] apexpool#3878
but you did not click on what I said 2 times, "Generate new address". try that after you restore the wallet.


[10/21/2021 7:59 PM] RH#8045
but I'm worried because if I restore the address now it might only bring through 34 ERG


[10/21/2021 8:00 PM] RH#8045
because it is only showing 1 address where I used multiple different addresses to transfer my ERG into my wallet but for one reason I can only see 1


[10/21/2021 8:00 PM] apexpool#3878
should I say again for the third time the same thing?


[10/21/2021 8:02 PM] RH#8045
I cannot do what you are telling me because I need to restore my wallet for me to be able to click 'generate new address'


[10/21/2021 8:02 PM] RH#8045
if my wallet isn't restored I cannot do what you are telling me


[10/21/2021 8:02 PM] apexpool#3878
restore the wallet and do that.


[10/21/2021 8:03 PM] RH#8045
but I am worried because if I restore my wallet will I lose a big chunk of my ERG?


[10/21/2021 8:03 PM] RH#8045
because it is only showing 1 address on the restore


[10/21/2021 8:03 PM] apexpool#3878
restoring a wallet does not affect what is in your wallet.

This is probably a noob question, but I've created an ergo node (finished synching) and used that adress to recieve mining rewards. I can even confirm the transactions been paid out (and recieved)
But balance still show 0? 
Anyone know what's going on?
 
I've read somewhere that a certain number of transactions need to be maid before balance shows, is this correct or have I misinterpreted?

[10/27/2021 7:52 PM] apexpool#3878
not so many, maybe 4-6 days.


[10/27/2021 7:53 PM] apexpool#3878
depending on current difficulty.


[10/27/2021 7:53 PM] hellyea#2223
Oh damn


[10/27/2021 7:53 PM] hellyea#2223
So I will basically use more electricity


[10/27/2021 7:53 PM] hellyea#2223
Instead


[10/27/2021 7:53 PM] apexpool#3878
it depends, but it is not impossible.


[10/27/2021 7:54 PM] apexpool#3878
with 1050ti, it is very likely.


[10/27/2021 7:54 PM] hellyea#2223
Can you tell me about this?

[10/27/2021 7:55 PM] apexpool#3878
it is probably ok, but maybe expensive.


[10/27/2021 7:59 PM] hellyea#2223
@apexpool so is it good idea if i buy this?

[10/27/2021 8:00 PM] apexpool#3878
I have no idea if it is expensive or not. 
I would not buy anything below 3060ti to mine. but they are expensive now...


[10/27/2021 8:01 PM] apexpool#3878
I believe the price is ok


[10/27/2021 8:01 PM] apexpool#3878
if the electricity is not expensive, it's probably ok.


[10/27/2021 8:01 PM] hellyea#2223
It’s 207 dollar


[10/27/2021 8:02 PM] hellyea#2223
My electricity rate is 0.06 KW/per hour


[10/27/2021 8:02 PM] apexpool#3878
it's a good price, I guess, for the card.


[10/27/2021 8:03 PM] hellyea#2223
So it will be mineable right


[10/27/2021 8:03 PM] apexpool#3878
yes. you can see in the spreadsheet.


[10/27/2021 8:03 PM] hellyea#2223
I just want to start simple, and see if I can profit.


[10/27/2021 8:03 PM] hellyea#2223
Don’t want to burn up entire gpu or pc


[10/27/2021 8:04 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, it will be good for mining, but don't expect too many ergo with it.


[10/27/2021 8:04 PM] hellyea#2223
It’s ok I will use unmineable


[10/27/2021 8:04 PM] hellyea#2223
Or nicehash maybe


[10/27/2021 8:04 PM] hellyea#2223
Heard they are good for low spec gpu


[10/27/2021 8:05 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, they are.


[10/27/2021 8:05 PM] apexpool#3878
and it's probably very good for gaming, too


[10/27/2021 8:05 PM] hellyea#2223
Other than Ergo what other coins will be easier to mine?


[10/27/2021 8:05 PM] hellyea#2223
Or else I will mine other coins and just exchange for ergo

Is it a good idea?


[10/27/2021 8:26 PM] apexpool#3878
if you can put a 1080 ti in it, yes. but many of the branded PCs cannot be upgraded, you have to be sure it has a mainboard with a PCI Express slot and that the case is big enough for the 1080 ti card.


[10/27/2021 8:26 PM] hellyea#2223

Trying to become better acquainted with the explorer. I've created my own NFT and I've minted from projects. When I look up the tokens though, I can only find the current location of the NFT, but can't find anything to show that I made this one, or address x created that other one

erg and beam are different coins and blockchains. 2miners offers mining pools for both coins.

what do you mean, how? mining each coin will have a different profitability.

BEAM and 2Miners BEAM aren't same coin?


[11/10/2021 11:30 AM] apexpool#3878
Beam is a coin and a blockchain, 2miners beam is a mining pool where miners can mine the Beam coin and secure the Beam blockchain.


[11/10/2021 11:38 AM] KeremD#9444
@apexpool Yes i agree with you but if you look my first screenshot, i can choise different BEAMs. What is the purpose i selected already using 2miners pool. So Why i can select BEAM - 2Miners as a coin section? You can see this in the photo. Both selected 2miners pool already. I'm asking this because of minerstat calculator says BEAM - 2Miners more profitable almost %30 (see 2. Photo) . I don't believe this but i still wanna to ask

An Issue With Change address of Node Wallet
A lot of complaints were given on a change address to be used which is not shown in the node (but balance is correct, at least, after rescan). Affected version are 4.0.13 - 4.0.15.  Since very early versions, Ergo node used root secret key (derived from seed) for change address. After switching to EIP-3, supported by CoinBarn and Yoroi around th...


[11/10/2021 10:27 PM] kushti#0978
what do you mean by stuck ?


[11/10/2021 10:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
You need other tokens/nfts to mix with - which isn't possible for NFTs. I think @anon2020s has to manually refund them.

I am having issue with this transaction: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/addresses/9gXicWtxhH6kdhqajJ4uhzjcvzMNM9TcrSDttpYaiEkufstRQHz


[11/11/2021 10:50 AM] misosoup#3130
This is an address to a hop i created in the ergo mixer on ergoutils website


[11/11/2021 10:50 AM] misosoup#3130
This is another problem I have, but it is in a different hop


[11/11/2021 10:57 AM] misosoup#3130
Basically, I have created a hop and used this to withdraw from Kucoin.  I have done this in the past and it worked fine so it's not due to this.  What I mean by stuck is that, the tokens that have been sent to the hop address did not make it through all the "steps", and thus has not made it to the intended receiving address.

sorry for being late. From you description in the private chat I think your funds are stuck in the mixer hops (ergoutils' service). If so, @anon_real can help with the issue. if the funds are stuck in the mixer, I can send you a code to put your private key and refund.

so i wouldnt put my main wallet into ergo faucet right? i should make a yoroi nightly wallet and then transfer ergo into that and sign that up to the ergofaucet correct? still learning how to use ergDeX and its fucking siiick


[11/12/2021 10:14 PM] andee#4722
I recommend creating a new wallet for nightly

cool, then sync it with android and have both handy right?

can i have multiple faucets active for one wallet?


[11/13/2021 12:10 AM] andee#4722
you dont connect the faucet to your wallet, you enter your address and get sent tokens


[11/13/2021 12:11 AM] Salu#0001
really? so i can just set my test wallet to be sent tokens, for any and all the offered tokens? theres no limit?


[11/13/2021 4:20 AM] lxzybones#3159
Hi, every time I put my receiving address into ergonfts.org it just pulls up a message that there are no tokens. When I check yoroi, it's all there so I'm not sure what the problem is


[11/13/2021 6:06 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Check your 'receive' tab then find 'has balance' on the bottom left. Your NFTs could be in any one of those addresses

huh? Nightly was likely just behind since it's still in beta - need to refresh it often. 

If you have lots of transactions use 'send all assets' to consolidate all your UTXO boxes.

[11/17/2021 3:01 PM] glasgowm#9381
Look on explorer, yoroi is just an interface. Send all assets just consolidates boxes and speeds it up.

My old wallet had X tokens (pic above) after resyncing the token reduced (pic above). Made a new Ergo wallet. Hoping that my lost tokens would come together. So sent entire Ergo with tokens to the new wallet. Got only the resynced amount, not all.

Well idc anymore. Not gonna store any funds in the wallet anymore anyways.


[11/17/2021 8:14 PM] andee#4722
verify in the explorer. screenshots of yoroi is of no use in this case


[11/17/2021 8:14 PM] hellyea#2223

yeah, so the one showing the most was wrong


[11/17/2021 8:15 PM] hellyea#2223

[11/20/2021 1:34 PM] andee#4722
did you receive a lot of small transactions? looks like it could be a problem with the size of the transaction. also, 1ERG is a lot even for large transactions


[11/20/2021 1:36 PM] andee#4722
try sending e.g 30ERG in two transactions. if you need to send 60ERG to a contract, just send 30ERG x2 to yourself first to consolidate utxo's.


[11/20/2021 1:39 PM] vanZz#1631
Ha okay that worked I just tried 2 x 30 ERG instead


[11/20/2021 1:39 PM] vanZz#1631
Does the fee need to scale with the amount to send?


[11/20/2021 2:32 PM] andee#4722
fee is dependent on the size of the transaction. if you send 60ERG and the transaction uses 60 x 1ERG inputs the transaction will need a ton of extra bytes in the block compared to 1 x 60ERG as input


[11/20/2021 2:33 PM] andee#4722
1ERG fee is a lot even for a transaction of maximum size though

@Community Developer @glasgowm 

 @owlt is having a strange issue  ( please correct me if I'm incorrect @owlt )
They recovered their wallet (from seed phrase) to the Via Wallet and when they performed a "Send All" it appears that it was able to move everything but for some reason there's something wrong with pulling the information from that wallet address from the explorer or api calls. 

Here's is one of their missing tokens:
https://ergotokens.org/#/?token=8243482f8b6c9bbbd4258c2d59dae970440cfa676f854c3156d33380f36a010f

Here is the transaction which they sent their wallet contents through and the receiving wallet appears as though it should have many things inside but that wallet appears empty by all accounts.
https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/d2b092583f62c0c558ddd44f58c05486263758851b4ba40a22d205e492d6d556

Here is the last transaction where that address seems to have held the contents in question:
https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/e62920edbebe5d20364fd997f0d354e026110ee30ab6091c38508febe9ccdb36 

but there's nothing in the transaction that indicates that the contents shouldn't be in that wallet afterwards.

I'm not sure if I'm not reading this correctly but I would appreciate if someone else could take a look.

It seems like it was able to send all the NFTs to a smart contract that didn't know how to handle them and so it didn't fail but didn't send either.

Via wallet doesnt support tokens, does it?


[11/24/2021 7:32 AM] Luivatra#9076
@owlt @EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV Look here, this tx has the boxes with all the tokens as input, but none of the output boxes have tokens. Does that mean they are burned?

On testnet I also lost tokens in one wallet but not another that I have been actively using lately.  I didn't dig in much...since it was testnet but I'll dig around more and see if I can learn more

[11/24/2021 7:47 AM] Luivatra#9076
there is no unspent box with that token in it, which basically means it is burned I guess (I am not knowledgeable in burning)

thanks for looking into it.

I’d also just like to point out that I didn’t execute this transaction. I think Via Wallet has a way of holding ERG in their own fashion, and it executed the transaction on my behalf.

hi (im NB, and i dont really know where to post it, sorry if isnt the place):


a strange thing happened yesterday during my auction.
I received a bid of 21 ERG and there were 43 minutes to end.

the auction was closed for 19 ergos, being that it was already at 21 and with time remaining.

can someone help me understand what might have happened? is there anyone i can talk to?

I have all the prints. even the buyer who bid for 21 ergos contacted me to understand what had happened.

I downloaded Via Wallet and restored using my seedphrase to bid on some NFTs while I was out of town, so maybe when I sent my first bid it also sent over all my assets to another address in Via Wallet? the reason I bring this up is because I wasn’t able to see almost all of my ERG in Yoroi, but I was able to see it in Via Wallet.


[11/24/2021 1:54 PM] owlt#4164
something similar was happening with the Auction House a few days ago. bids are getting reverted.

@HazeyOneKenobi, @RΣD and I noticed that. possibly @pbr713 too if he was there


[11/24/2021 1:57 PM] Luivatra#9076
Probably best in the auction house channel but tag @anon_real and see what he can say about the issue 🙂

Trying to setup a node locally.  ran the ergo_installer.sh script and everything started up without issue.  I was sync'ed through early Sept this year when the node crashed.  trying to relaunch the node I get:


[11/30/2021 6:16 PM] owesatuma#7054
```dpazzula@james:~/ergo$ java ergo.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf
Error: Could not find or load main class ergo.jar

```


[11/30/2021 6:39 PM] glasgowm#9381
Looks like your ergo.jar file might be corrupted ?


[11/30/2021 6:41 PM] owesatuma#7054
I just figured it out and was back to say, "I'm an idiot and forgot `-jar` before the jar file."


[11/30/2021 6:56 PM] wileyyy#7785
Well refund just came through which nice, still confused why the bid didn't register, but at least I got the erg back.


[11/30/2021 7:19 PM] owesatuma#7054
Node is up to the tip of the chain (based on "bestHeaderId"), but the sychronization is only on like block 100,000.  I'm guessing the node is validating the blocks.  Is there a way to speed this up, or do I just need to wait it out?


[12/01/2021 5:37 AM] wileyyy#7785
My node stops running after the initial script is done executing in the command prompt.  Is this part of the .conf file supposed to have my directory or is the ${} a java thing to get it itself?


[12/01/2021 5:37 AM] wileyyy#7785
ergo {
    directory = ${ergo.directory}"/.ergo"
    node {
        mining = false
    }
    wallet.secretStorage.secretDir = ${ergo.directory}"/wallet/keystore"
}


[12/01/2021 6:42 AM] andee#4722
it will resolve to the directory you are running the jar from, do you have a copy of the terminal output when you run the node?


[12/01/2021 6:43 AM] andee#4722

no it runs, but it stops after a couple of hours and the wallet never finishes syncing

[12/01/2021 7:00 AM] wileyyy#7785
Well maybe changing to the minimal config and clearing the log helped? Seems to be running fine, we'll see if it can make it through the whole sync. Maybe a dumb question, do I just run that java -jar command to run the node when needed or will it persist in the background if I let it


[12/01/2021 7:09 AM] wileyyy#7785

[12/01/2021 7:16 AM] andee#4722
you have to run it like that unless you add it as a service


[12/01/2021 7:17 AM] andee#4722
also make sure you are in the same folder as the jar and config when you run it, if you make a script change to that folder before running


[12/01/2021 7:59 AM] apexpool#3878
how long does the initial sync of the ergo node take?


[12/01/2021 9:21 AM] andee#4722
depends on cpu and ram, I would say 4 to 24 hours


[12/01/2021 9:22 AM] andee#4722

too bad the extensions are not released on github, would have been easier to revert

android wallet, node


[12/01/2021 9:48 AM] andee#4722
if the extension was relased on github it would be easy to revert back to see if it was caused by some of the updates. not possible to revert using browser store


[12/01/2021 11:27 AM] andee#4722
the node wallet is not hard to use, the hardest part is hashing your password and putting it in the config

that's easy, too.


[12/01/2021 11:28 AM] apexpool#3878

Looks like you are not syncing, delete .ergo/{history,state} and start over


[12/01/2021 1:38 PM] andee#4722
Check node output to confirm it’s syncing, it should show ‘new height xxx’ etc


[12/01/2021 1:51 PM] apexpool#3878
doing it now.


[12/01/2021 2:25 PM] apexpool#3878
it's syncing now, about half already done, by the current height.


[12/01/2021 2:45 PM] andee#4722
First part is pretty fast as it’s just headers, make a copy of the db when finished syncing (with node shutdown) in case it corrupts later


[12/01/2021 2:45 PM] apexpool#3878
I will.


[12/01/2021 2:47 PM] apexpool#3878
are there any tools similar to cardano-cli (in case you know it), to be able to do command line transactions (to manually select the address and USxOs where to send funds from)?


[12/01/2021 4:09 PM] andee#4722
you can do it using the API, other than that I only know of ergo-tool

Basic question: I have both Yoroi and Yoroi Nightly, but only the latter can interact with ErgoDex.  Is there any reason to keep Yoroi as well, or does Nightly function the same in all respects?


[12/04/2021 4:46 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, to use it as your main wallet, for example.


[12/04/2021 5:37 PM] boostopasta#7196
By this do you mean keeping my assets off Nightly unless I will be using them to interact with the dex?


[12/04/2021 5:38 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, that would be an option.

Yes thats normal, smart contract addresses can be very long. Usually you can just click on the address text and it will be automatically copied to your clipboard. From there you can paste it into a wallet of your choice and send the ERG.

waiting for Tesseract review


[12/10/2021 5:45 PM] Flaxen#1974
Hi guys, I also posted this on the forums but I will post here as well for some visibility, I hope thats ok


[12/10/2021 5:46 PM] Flaxen#1974
Hi everyone,

I have worked hard to try to accrue as much ergo I could reasonably afford and I was always concerned with security, because evidently everything can be hacked one way or the other, so i have set up a ergo full node on my secondary machine. Yes, my probable mistake was to put everything on windows …

Recently I have made a few small transactions from the full node wallet to my yoroi wallet. 1 and 2 ergos.
Within those transactions I saw that there are some additional addresses in there, but checking my ergo node wallet, the numbers didn’t add up.

On the explorer it was clearly stated, that I have 97.1913 ergos, when on the ergo node wallet it was clearly said that I have ~236 so i didn’t think of it.

Yesterday, I decided to create a more secure place for my ergo wallet on a VM, when I decided to move everything, I kept getting an error, I couldn’t even move a single ERG out of the wallet (error was “Transaction with this ID was not found, or it has not entered Mempool yet”.

As I found this strange I decided to investigate, so in the CLI it said “Failed to initialize storage: org.fusesource.leveldbjni.internal.NativeDB$DBException: Corruption: CURRENT file does not end with newline.”

To fix this, I renamed the history and state folders so i can start to completely re-sync. Once the sync was complete, to my horror, it was no longer showing me 236 ERG, but 97.1913.

Once I checked the transactions on the explorer, it was there, clear as day, another address, within my 1-2 ERG transactions, with way higher values.


[12/10/2021 5:46 PM] Flaxen#1974
To date, 130 ERG are missing. I do not know this address, I checked every single exchange that I used, it is not any of them. This address, currently holds what used to be my 130 ergos.

Before posting the addresses, funny thing is, I always TRIPLECHECK every single transaction, to make sure the fields are only populated by the addresses where I want to send, scroll left and right to make sure there is nothing else in the address fields. Yet somehow, if it turns out that this was injected somehow, those transactions were made.

Is it possible at all to validate my claims? I still have 97 ergos in there that i would like to get out, but if every time I do a transaction there is a way to inject another address … its basically gone before I may even have a chance to salvage what is left.

My main wallet address: 9hUVScrWS5MMS9bLxabg8jiuTTuWMtq4Tswo6cyfTiJZkPTsXoX
My Yoroi: 9gJmMAAQq8PLNskKKF5FSJ3GfauT3KZ27R5AHxvscN1n2txx8oP
The suspect address: 9efMs56kANdn9udDDnW6xYHjD2U1pscu3q4fYSpybXw6ooXk5rQ

I appreciate any feedback anyone might have.
This burns my heart to no avail … I tried to be so careful.


[12/10/2021 6:40 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Is the address in question making more transactions to other addresses or is it an isolated address with only transactions from your other address in the ledger history?


[12/10/2021 6:41 PM] Flaxen#1974
It seems it is isolated with only transactions from my main addr


[12/10/2021 6:43 PM] liquid_phase#4605
First tx 00:30:35, 16.10.2021 - 2 months ago. Does the timing correlate to you setting up your node?


[12/10/2021 6:43 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Follow up question, I haven’t used node but does it allow you to create a receiving address on the node like ergo mixer can?


[12/10/2021 6:44 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Follow up question, are you sendin Tokens like NFT or just erg


[12/10/2021 6:51 PM] Flaxen#1974
The node was set up at the first transaction 12:35:03 24.05.2021


[12/10/2021 6:52 PM] Flaxen#1974
the first transaction towards the suspected account is 09:30:35 16.10.2021


[12/10/2021 6:53 PM] Flaxen#1974
that 5,1 was sent to tradeogre, I haven't noticed the additional transaction, as mentioned in my original text, the wallet from the node reflected exactly my transactions (5,1 in this case, for example)


[12/10/2021 6:53 PM] Flaxen#1974
I am only using it for ERG, nothing else, no other assets


[12/10/2021 6:54 PM] Flaxen#1974
The node allows creation of additional addresses


[12/10/2021 6:55 PM] Flaxen#1974
since the node reflected only my transactions, 5.1, 1, 2 and 1 ERG sent


[12/10/2021 6:55 PM] Flaxen#1974
the balance on the node would go down only by the above amounts


[12/10/2021 7:22 PM] andee#4722
what version node are you running? that address is your change address, so the erg is still in your possession


[12/10/2021 7:23 PM] andee#4722
if you are not running the latest version, try upgrading and see if it adds the address. there was a fix regarding change address


[12/10/2021 7:24 PM] Flaxen#1974
It is slightly outdated 4.0.10.0


[12/10/2021 7:24 PM] andee#4722
there was a change address fix in 4.0.16


[12/10/2021 7:24 PM] Flaxen#1974
This would correlated the amounts being transferred


[12/10/2021 7:26 PM] Flaxen#1974
Allright, I'll update the node. Just for my refference, replacing the .jar would update the rest?


[12/10/2021 7:26 PM] Flaxen#1974
admitedly i could of done a better job of reading the changelogs and documentation


[12/10/2021 7:26 PM] andee#4722
download new jar and make sure you are not firing up the old one 🙂


[12/10/2021 7:27 PM] Flaxen#1974
I'll change the config, trying now, thank you


[12/10/2021 7:27 PM] Flaxen#1974
fingers crossed


[12/10/2021 7:27 PM] andee#4722
👍


[12/10/2021 7:36 PM] Flaxen#1974
Right, new version is reporting a corruption, 12 missing files from the objects folder, I assume I need to re-sync the node


[12/10/2021 7:36 PM] Flaxen#1974
trying that


[12/11/2021 12:17 PM] Flaxen#1974
Awesome, after updating the node and running a re-sync, I had to rescan the wallet, but once that was done, all the ergos showed up! It seems in the end, I was my own bad actor by being ignorant. Its interesting to see how my paranoid mind went straight to "i was hacked". Live and learn. Thanks for all the help guys!

After syncing headers you can use `node:port/info` , `headersHeight - fullHeight` is how many blocks are left to sync

[12/21/2021 8:42 AM] Massaker#4565
Hi, was looking to setup a node and the github page suggest running ergo-installer.sh script.
```curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ergoplatform/ergo/master/ergo-installer.sh | sh -s -- --api-key=<YOUR_API_KEY>```
I'm lost when it asks for <YOUR_API_KEY>   (where, how, do i get this?)


[12/21/2021 9:08 AM] apexpool#3878
you generate it in the node web interface, if I remember correctly.


[12/21/2021 9:11 AM] Massaker#4565
weird (to have the node web interface.  that would mean i already have the node installed)


[12/21/2021 9:12 AM] Massaker#4565
maybe this argument creates an api key?  instead of asking for one then? idk


[12/21/2021 9:14 AM] andee#4722
for the installer script, replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with the actual password you want to use

[12/21/2021 9:15 AM] Massaker#4565
kk thank you.


[12/21/2021 9:15 AM] andee#4722
it will get hashed and added to your config


[12/21/2021 9:16 AM] Massaker#4565
am i the only one who thinks that's seems likes its it requesting an api key instead of creating one.

[12/21/2021 9:17 AM] andee#4722
it should say password, not api key, agreed


[12/21/2021 10:27 AM] Q86#4155
Anyone has an idea what this could be? Happens when i try to restore my wallet on both apps, Yoroi and Yoroi nightly... and as well on 2 PCs now. Checksum is correct, always gets stucked at the same point in time, then restores from beginning again inifinite. Have the logs if anyone needs. Thanks.

    # Misbehaving peer penalty score will not be increased withing this time interval,
    # unless permanent penalty is applied
    penaltySafeInterval = 20.seconds

Latency issue?


[12/21/2021 2:48 PM] andee#4722
there has been sync problems caused by a seed node running 4.0.17, adding those settings will make sure it gets blacklisted before it crashes your node


[12/21/2021 2:49 PM] andee#4722
from my understanding it was fixed, but looks like its still going on


[12/21/2021 2:50 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Just added. Will let you know in 5.. Usually crashes by then


[12/21/2021 2:52 PM] HelixEvo#2120
It was fine up until about 260k block height, then started with this behaviour.

I just made the first transfer from the yoroi browser addon wallet. It appears on the blockchain, 5 erg to  destination address, 0.0011 fee to some random address, and the transaction also contains a 0.249 to my own wallet address (where it was sent from). Why is this ?


[12/21/2021 4:09 PM] Huginn#2291
that's how utxo works I asume, you just burned one box ov 5.2501 ERG and it got split into 3 boxes of 5, 0.249 and 0.0011 ERG


[12/21/2021 4:10 PM] voidwalker#1983
ohhh, I had no idea.. what's this "box" thing ?


[12/21/2021 4:11 PM] Huginn#2291
it's how utxo works, let me find one recent article talking about it might help you understand.

Initially syncing a node.. Seems the logs look good, but the block height on the ERGO node interface is not increasing the block height number. Best Block ID also showing as changing, so its ticking along.. Any ideas why block height not updating


[12/22/2021 12:41 AM] glasgowm#9381
The headers need to sync first - once the the headers reach the current height the blocks will start.


[12/22/2021 12:41 AM] glasgowm#9381
Check the info pane @ http://localhost:9053/info


[12/22/2021 12:49 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Does it sync batches at a time then? As it’s currently in the 277k heights.


[12/22/2021 12:51 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Will it do say 277k - 300k headers next say, so the block height stays at 277k until the 300k header is downloaded


[12/22/2021 12:51 AM] glasgowm#9381
no it should update dynamically throughout


[12/22/2021 12:51 AM] glasgowm#9381
what are the values for `height` and `headersHeight`


[12/22/2021 1:15 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Scratch that. It’s incrementing now. 👌


[12/22/2021 10:37 AM] HelixEvo#2120

Is there an easy way to clear down files so you can start sync from scratch?


[12/22/2021 2:50 PM] glasgowm#9381
Delete the `.ergo/state` and `.ergo/sync` folder

What are logs saying when it stops working?


[12/22/2021 2:52 PM] glasgowm#9381
You can use `tail -Fn+0 ergo.log | grep 'ERROR'` to see only the error's - or `tail -Fn+0 ergo.log | grep 'ERROR\|WARN'` for error/warn


[12/22/2021 3:22 PM] andee#4722
is it still shutting down? 4GB ram slows down the sync a lot when node closes in on block 300k

Couple of mentions of db corruption yesterday. Is there a folder to backup that contains the block files? Just guessing if db corrupt then I guess it’s a full sync from fresh?


[12/23/2021 10:46 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Regarding full node


[12/23/2021 11:07 AM] andee#4722
history and state


[12/23/2021 11:07 AM] andee#4722
need to shutdown node properly before making a backup


[12/23/2021 11:09 AM] andee#4722
if you have a wallet there its probably best to backup the whole `.ergo` dir


[12/23/2021 11:09 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Running it as systemctl service. Is there a right way to shut it down?


[12/23/2021 11:10 AM] andee#4722
sigint will initiate a proper shutdown


[12/23/2021 11:11 AM] andee#4722
if you use podman/docker add `--stop-signal=SIGINT` to your run command


[12/23/2021 11:12 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Thanks. I’m not using docker for node currently. The files are precious arnt they. Just had a crash and sync is buggered again.


[12/23/2021 11:12 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Was up to 277k


[12/23/2021 11:14 AM] andee#4722
Were there any penalties or double application of modifiers in logs before it happened?


[12/23/2021 11:15 AM] HelixEvo#2120
I’ll have to check. But the crash was system. Tried using cockpit while it was syncing


[12/23/2021 11:15 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Odd


[12/23/2021 11:16 AM] andee#4722
Oh, that changes things. Yes, sudden loss of power or system crash can cause corruption. This has been an ongoing problem for bitcoin nodes too


[12/23/2021 11:30 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Interesting.. Only crashes the server if mobile used to access cockpit 🤦‍♂️ Anyways. Will delete state and history folders now and re-try from start


[12/23/2021 11:37 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Weekly backup I guess will suffice..


[12/23/2021 11:58 AM] andee#4722
Depends on what it will be used for, having a backup at +600k height reduces sync time by a long time

Not anything to pinpoint with there. But try adding this within scorex {} in your config ```    network {

    # Misbehaving peer penalty score will not be increased withing this time interval,
    # unless permanent penalty is applied
    penaltySafeInterval = 20.seconds

    # Max penalty score peer can accumulate before being banned
    penaltyScoreThreshold = 5
    maxDeliveryChecks = 2

     }
```

On node. Block height not increasing but best block id keeps changing. Is it still syncing?


[12/26/2021 11:26 AM] andee#4722
check /info, fullheight


[12/26/2021 12:10 PM] HelixEvo#2120
fullHeight" : 361833,
  "headersHeight" : 649699,


[12/26/2021 12:10 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Full height does not seem to be moving


[12/26/2021 10:04 PM] Siegfried#2220
Thanks. Will do that. Is there any good example of config file? Mine just turned mining off.

hey peeps, quick question. I'm setting up a node in my Windows machine, but later I'm planning to copy the files over to my mac so it won't have to sync from scratch. Will this work?


[12/26/2021 10:49 PM] Siegfried#2220
It seems the network config cannot help on the memory issue. https://pastebin.com/2t90q6Kh

the node causing the problem was blacklisted right before the crash. try changing 20.seconds to 2.seconds


[12/26/2021 11:06 PM] Siegfried#2220
Ok


[12/27/2021 1:47 AM] HelixEvo#2120
I’ve given up for now trying to fully sync a node. Tried a few versions (4.0.16 & 4.0.16.2) along with 8GB mem, 12GB men, Ubuntu 20/Fedora server all using latest Java release. Always seems to bomb out as you get to 400-500k block height. Headers seem to sync fine


[12/27/2021 2:11 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Any reason why logs from node have multiple entries for private IPs in the database? Is there no way to blacklist all private ip classes?


[12/27/2021 2:24 AM] MarantzCube#4825
Same f*!@#$%ing issue. Tried about 10 times on different comps with Ubuntu 18 (4.0.12-4.0.16). But on Windows it was synchronized right from the first try 🤪


[12/27/2021 2:49 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Really? Thought it would be other way around 😎


[12/27/2021 3:27 AM] MarantzCube#4825
Yeah. For Ubuntu I will wait for release with DB repairing (kushti said somewhere 4.0.17+ maybe). I killed a lot of time while trying, have no more nerves for it. 🤪


[12/27/2021 10:50 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Window has db repairing?


[12/27/2021 9:00 PM] HelixEvo#2120
FYI.. I have swapped my Java version out to 11. This seems to have fixed the issues for me. I was using version 17


[12/27/2021 9:57 PM] Siegfried#2220
I think your config deserves to be a good example. After changed to 2.seconds, the Ergo container has been running for almost a day without a crash.


[12/27/2021 10:00 PM] andee#4722
v4.0.17 was just released and should do initial sync without shutting down without those blacklist settings, but great that it worked out! My node crashed every time it connected with the same node that caused your problems


[12/27/2021 10:03 PM] Siegfried#2220
Let me try that.


[12/28/2021 12:57 AM] MarantzCube#4825
No, I mean on win node works ok without any headache.

Was this message when running a node mean DB corrupt? Got "GetReaders request in state (None,None,None,None)"


[12/29/2021 3:28 PM] andee#4722
Its normal right after starting up, but not after maybe +30 seconds


[12/29/2021 3:29 PM] HelixEvo#2120
If after 30?


[12/29/2021 3:29 PM] HelixEvo#2120
I was just going on to backup the files as well 🤦‍♂️


[12/29/2021 3:35 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Ahh may of dodged a bullet there. Logs look good right now. will stop service soon and backup - assuming you have to stop the service to backup the files?


[12/30/2021 10:32 AM] glasgowm#9381
use the shutdown command


[12/30/2021 10:33 AM] glasgowm#9381
It happens when the Actor that reads the headers crashes I think. Can happen due to JVM heap overload. Often requires a resync from scratch though unless it manages to fix itself.


[12/30/2021 10:34 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Luckily it’s all synced now 👌

I was trying to hook into the ergodex liquidity pool last night. I got the message to install the Yoroi dapp Connector.
However the link for it took me to a Google 404 error.
Can someone provide some insight to getting past this?


[01/02/2022 2:28 PM] Steve Lockhart#5327
I'm on an iMac using Chrome.


[01/02/2022 2:30 PM] glasgowm#9381
It's just Yoroi Nightly you need now - dApp connector has been bundled into it.


[01/02/2022 2:32 PM] Steve Lockhart#5327
and yet on the ergodex page i cant connect to the yoroi nightly wallet, i get the message to install both the yoroi nightly and the dappconnector


[01/02/2022 2:33 PM] Steve Lockhart#5327

I was trying to send all of my ergo out of my wallet - I sent 18 and the fee says 1 ERGO in the pending transaction - but when i look at the TX it says 0.0011 and then i get an error saying the TX is not in the memory pool - I only have 18.134798832 ERGO in this wallet and it is trying to send 19 ergo for what ever reason - how long does it take for the TX to just fail ?


[01/03/2022 5:46 PM] Pistol | wattpool.net#7602
see it looks correct here - https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/addresses/9g5DjD4kVmKAPtuEiDv83jCrrh6MNPFjmx8FmcpuxEfYBqiM7yp


[01/03/2022 5:47 PM] Pistol | wattpool.net#7602
but when i try and look at the actual TX - it shows up but then after a few secs it just disappears - https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/8d3e0225f955af28e02b00f2f9cfa22e0714af61536b7a0eac683f5c0d4b7fdd

it just failed!


[01/03/2022 5:49 PM] Pistol | wattpool.net#7602
so it failed but now my wallet has no coin in it as if the tx went through


[01/03/2022 5:50 PM] Pistol | wattpool.net#7602

It been syncing but its lost connection and crashed multiple times. Never gotten a full sync and I've been trying since yesterday, switched computers hoping to get away from the crashing but it's already gone down once


[01/04/2022 7:47 AM] HelixEvo#2120
What version client you using and also Java version? Also what logs say from the service crash?

[01/05/2022 5:04 AM] HelixEvo#2120
@nox071218 Once you restart the node, does it continue to increase the block height sync total or is it stuck? What is block height currently and total height headers showing in http://127.0.0.1:9053/info


[01/05/2022 5:05 AM] HelixEvo#2120
If it continues to start increasing again, then I had a similar issue. Never fully got to the bottom of it, but once fully synced it was fine. Must be some Java crash I was thinking.


[01/05/2022 5:07 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Current version 4.0.19 and Java 11 though does fully work on Linux machine. Just needs hand holding until full sync has been achieved

Thanks for the help. I haven't been paying attention to block hight


[01/05/2022 5:25 AM] nox071218#1778
It is increasing right now I'll have to check it it goes down.. it's 440034 when I look at /panel and it's 44047 in the script


[01/05/2022 5:29 AM] nox071218#1778
Good to hear Ill just keep resetting it, to be safe I just killed the process. When I restarted current height is increasing


[01/05/2022 5:38 AM] HelixEvo#2120
That’s something I guess 🙃 How is swap mem? “vmstat 1 5” so values should not be too high if any at all.


[01/05/2022 5:39 AM] nox071218#1778
switch back to my only computer let me run top and check... last time SWAP was fine just crazy cpu output. Nipopow's cant come soon enough lol


[01/05/2022 5:39 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Yeah make sure you bring the service down nicely also. Don’t want to curropt them files at 430k which I did twice 🤦‍♂️


[01/05/2022 5:40 AM] nox071218#1778
when you say nicely? what do you mean; i usually just do ctr+c lol


[01/05/2022 5:40 AM] HelixEvo#2120

[01/05/2022 12:03 PM] andee#4722
depending on the signal you use that can result in a corrupt db. sigint will make the node shutdown properly


[01/05/2022 12:26 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Ahh yeah forgot that. Maybe worth looking into setting it up via proper service channels


[01/05/2022 1:30 PM] andee#4722
Yep. And if using docker or podman add sigint as stop signal


[01/05/2022 8:55 PM] alexandru#0679
Hello, I created a token with amount 1000000000 and I have a few questions:
1. I searched the token on ergotokens.org and it shows, but it says "no image-audio token", should there be a logo image there like on Cardano pool.pm shows on tokens for example ? And if yes, how I create a token with an image too, because on ErgoUtils there is no option for it.
2. I want users to be able to buy the token, but there is no trust if all the tokens are in my wallet, what's the workflow here? How can I sell the tokens and eliminate the idea of a rug pull ?
3. Where do I sell them? Can I do this through ErgoDex or there is another option ?

Short story: I'm working with a lot of music artists in my country and I want to create an ecosystem for them to be able to buy, sell nfts, etc. in the first stage, but then I have other ideas to scale, and I want to offer the people who believe in my project the oportunity to help by buying the ecosystem token.


[01/05/2022 8:57 PM] alexandru#0679
Oh, and why the airdrop option is greyed out on ergoutils ? https://ergoutils.org/#/airdrop


[01/06/2022 6:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
1. There's no logo's for tokens - someone was discussing it the other day if you search
2. No way to sell tokens unless you write a smart contract. 
3. Need to wait for ErgoDex to allow custom pools.

Just a glitch in Yoroi, refresh and try again


[01/08/2022 10:57 AM] glasgowm#9381
explorer is what matters


[01/08/2022 10:57 AM] Donalddd#2998

me too, sent some erg from kucoin to yoroi, initially viewed the transaction as unconfirmed on the explorer but now it doesn't show at all

been like 3 hours


[01/09/2022 6:49 PM] Donalddd#2998
for me I can't even send from one wallet to another. It can be a yoroi and yoroi nightly issue though.


[01/09/2022 6:49 PM] Donalddd#2998
since I send from yoroi then it never appears on the explorer


[01/09/2022 6:50 PM] Donalddd#2998
does it appear in your address in the explorer?


[01/09/2022 6:50 PM] Σotiris#3516
initially yes as unconfirmed, now I can't view it at all


[01/09/2022 6:51 PM] Donalddd#2998
do control shift R to get a refreshed view of your address


[01/09/2022 6:52 PM] Σotiris#3516
already done that


[01/09/2022 6:52 PM] Donalddd#2998
I thought it was an Ergo issue, but then I sent some tip to glasgow and it appears on the explorer, not on my wallet though.


[01/09/2022 6:53 PM] Σotiris#3516
I'm not worried at all, I'm sure if there's  an issue they'll fix it


[01/09/2022 7:01 PM] Donalddd#2998
I am not worried at all. I am afraid though that this kinda issues will be a barrier for new users to come onboard. Thankfully we will have progress there, many people working on new wallets etc.

hi, I have the same problem with Aresergo. I saw the transaction yesterday. but today it was gone like nothing happened.


[01/10/2022 9:59 AM] haiv#2011
i also sent from Kucoin, but to my Yoroi wallet


[01/10/2022 10:10 AM] glasgowm#9381
There was an issue with KuCoin sending transactions, will be fixed soon.


[01/10/2022 10:27 AM] haiv#2011
thanks, @glasgowm

Having same issue with Kucoin, since 14 hours withdraw to Yoroi not yet arrived showing “…. not entered Mempool yet”

Hello. I’m using Yoroi extension on Mozilla with Ubuntu OS. It seems to be down. Wallet doesn’t sync


[01/10/2022 7:59 PM] lxzybones#3159
I'm having the same issue


[01/10/2022 8:00 PM] blackinsecure#3693
it takes a whole while before it does


[01/10/2022 8:00 PM] blackinsecure#3693
advice is to use your seed phrase and recover your wallet using the official Ergo Mobile Wallet


[01/10/2022 8:01 PM] blackinsecure#3693
and leave Yoroi to ADA only


[01/10/2022 8:01 PM] blackinsecure#3693
works much better for both


[01/10/2022 8:01 PM] blackinsecure#3693
I have the same setup and the above advice is what made everything usable for me

saw it for a bit as unconfirmed. now can't see it at all. as @glasgowm said, it is an issue with Kucoin sending transasctions and it'll be fixed soon.

I got caught up with the same issue. The transaction ID generated by Kucoin shows as invalid on Explorer. It's been over a day and I don't think that transaction will ever appear. Contacted Kucoin support and they said they will try to resend the coins. Fingers crossed.


[01/11/2022 1:33 PM] llcrypto#3644
Yep I am in the same boat. Transaction was completed in Kucoin with an Ergo Txn ID but it's invalid on explorer. Glad to know this is a Kucoin issue. Fingers cross this will be fixed soon.

ah good, I have a legit reason to not airdrop


[01/11/2022 4:37 PM] lxzybones#3159
I know kucoin withdrawal's are an issue right now, but if it shows as completed on kucoin, do I have to ask their customer support or is that an issue I can resolve with a transaction ID after the issue is cleared up?


[01/11/2022 4:38 PM] lxzybones#3159
I'm one of the ones whose withdrawal isn't in the mempool yet.


[01/11/2022 4:41 PM] glasgowm#9381
I believe KuCoin issues are sorted now so yes


[01/11/2022 4:42 PM] glasgowm#9381

I see the answer is Please run with a config: java -jar /opt/ergo/ergo.jar --mainnet mainnet.conf
my question is do I use my own api key and hash and how would I generate the hash? 
Simplest config is :

ergo {
networkType = "mainnet"
}

scorex {

restApi {
// API key == "hello" (without quotes)
apiKeyHash = "324dcf027dd4a30a932c441f365a25e86b173defa4b8e58948253471b81b72cf"

The node I am running shows the proper block height. The API Key is correct and the wallet is unlocked (shows proper address), but my balance is zero, any ideas?)

Hello 
I'm trying to setup a full node to host a pool. After I initialized the node and creates a password for my wallet through the web portal my phone battery died before I wrote down the memenic,  do I need to start over or can I retrieve the mnemenic?


[01/14/2022 8:12 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yes


[01/14/2022 8:13 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yes but it's disabled atm


[01/14/2022 8:20 AM] archen#0837
Yes like you need to start over or yes you can get the mnemonic?😃


[01/14/2022 8:25 AM] glasgowm#0000
You need to delete the wallet folder and create a new one

[01/14/2022 9:21 AM] alexandru#0679
That s a good point, but also who has spam as a goal will do it with or without the tool


[01/14/2022 9:22 AM] Donalddd#2998
that's also true. Maybe allowing particular tokens to be accepted in each address could have been a nice addition but I doubt it is possible at this point.

remove `.ergo/history` and `.ergo/peers` and retry while watching the output, `headersHeight` should start increasing within a few mins - if not send the (new) log file through

Ergo is built for resiliance not throughput. It was also designed to support most L2 protocols too though so this will improve in future.


[01/15/2022 3:21 PM] suicidalfellow#0000

[01/15/2022 3:22 PM] suicidalfellow#0000

[01/15/2022 4:10 PM] suicidalfellow#0000
Hope that block assembly comes asap. Since NFT games and dapps are releasing now on Ergo blockchain, we don’t want to miss out the bids for those NFT’s. Tbh it’s looks like we are bidding with Bitcoin instead of Ergo if we are talking about Ergo Auction House.

you can use any other wallet instead of Yoroi, just recover the wallet using the recovery words in ccvault or typhonwallet or Daedalus (full node). there are other options, too, but I gave you my favorites in the right order.

So what do I do if I sent some ERGO and the 'submitted' box on Yoroi Wallet is still doing it's thing a day later?


[01/21/2022 1:40 AM] StevieJay#5425
I sent ERGO to mint some NFTs to test this all out


[01/21/2022 1:41 AM] StevieJay#5425
Am I out of luck and need to do it again?


[01/21/2022 3:45 AM] iamRBT#0000
One question : which erg wallet do you guys think is the best atm ?


[01/21/2022 3:51 AM] iamRBT#0000
I noticed yoroi has big sync times , like 8 days i have atm showing


[01/21/2022 3:52 AM] iamRBT#0000
Im looking for alternatives , maybe better ones than yoroi


[01/21/2022 4:15 AM] Dv#3650
How many transactions do you have? That should've been patched out recently


[01/21/2022 4:23 AM] iamRBT#0000
Emmm last transaction was round that time

[01/21/2022 4:34 AM] Bozsdrin0307#0000
Yoroi wallet app


[01/21/2022 4:34 AM] Stephen#0000
Yes u should be able to


[01/21/2022 4:34 AM] Stephen#0000
Whoever u with request from them


[01/21/2022 4:35 AM] Bozsdrin0307#0000
Ok I will do that thank you.


[01/21/2022 6:45 AM] andee#4722
No, only restoring from seed will work


[01/21/2022 8:08 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
No this isn't possible with a crypto wallet (re @Stephen: Whoever u with request from them)


[01/21/2022 8:09 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
No you can't. You need to use your seed phrase and restore the wallet. Also don't answer and DM of someone trying to "help" (re @Bozsdrin0307: Can I request to reset my password?)


[01/21/2022 8:22 AM] Stephen#0000

Hi


[01/21/2022 2:21 PM] TexasRed#6795
Does sigmausd.io work?  Everytime i try to convert sigusd to erg i get a stuck transaction due to low funds in the proxy address.


[01/21/2022 2:21 PM] TexasRed#6795
And do not receive erg back to my address


[01/21/2022 2:25 PM] arkadias#4896
i cant answer on this specifically but u could always try the dex to convert back to erg


[01/21/2022 2:36 PM] glasgowm#9381
You need to send double the fee when sending to sigUSD from mobile wallet - yoroi does it automatically


[01/21/2022 2:37 PM] glasgowm#9381

I just sent a transaction from yoroi and the fee amount is listed as “1047 ergo”


[01/21/2022 5:06 PM] RΣD#7477
Is that an error?


[01/21/2022 5:07 PM] RΣD#7477
It has to be an error


[01/21/2022 5:09 PM] kushti_ru#0000
Must be, please check on explorer (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <RΣD> It has to be an error)


[01/21/2022 5:11 PM] glasgowm#0000

Anyone tried withdraw from kucoin to ios wallet? Tried a small amount around 30 min ago but it hasnt reflected yet on my ergo ios wallet


[01/22/2022 1:41 AM] onins#1276
It says completed on kucoin but when I checked the Txn Hash it says no transaction ID yet or not yet on mempool.


[01/22/2022 5:12 AM] TheRenDog#8004
@onins Im in the same position right now


[01/22/2022 5:12 AM] TheRenDog#8004
I withdrew a small amount from Kucoin to the android wallet and still nothing.


[01/22/2022 5:12 AM] TheRenDog#8004
Did you ever get yours?


[01/22/2022 6:58 AM] soysor#6001
I've had issues converting SigmaUSD to ERG using sigmausd.io for the last 5 days, always fails

Is there problems at the moment?


[01/22/2022 8:10 AM] glasgowm#9381
Nope check ergo.watch


[01/22/2022 8:13 AM] soysor#6001
Oh cool, didn't know about that site

Any ideas why the conversion is never successful and what I can try? I've tried like 8 times over the last 5 days


[01/22/2022 8:13 AM] glasgowm#9381
Probably busy. Can take 8 times on a good day


[01/22/2022 8:14 AM] glasgowm#9381
ErgoDex is down so everyone's stuck using sigUSD


[01/22/2022 8:15 AM] soysor#6001
Oh ok, thanks 👍


[01/22/2022 8:18 AM] glasgowm#9381
What happens? Automatic refund or manual refund ?


[01/22/2022 8:18 AM] soysor#6001
Auto refunds


[01/22/2022 8:18 AM] glasgowm#9381
Time it with the oracle and try it a few times in a row and should work


[01/22/2022 8:19 AM] soysor#6001
Will do, thanks for the help

[01/23/2022 8:01 AM] glasgowm#0000
No you need to send it to a new wallet


[01/23/2022 8:05 AM] Agus#0000
In yoroi asset can send a new wallet too?


[01/23/2022 9:22 AM] hellyea#2223

Hello, I'm a little confused how Ledger S works with Yoroi. If I have an existing Yoroi wallet and get a Ledger S, I will essentially be creating a new wallet that is linked to the Ledger? If my existing wallet was delegated, I'll have to re-delegate the new Ledger wallet and wait the appropriate amount of epochs, again, before getting rewards in the new Ledger wallet? If I create a Ledger wallet, can the whole process be done with Ledger Live and Yoroi on my phone, or do I still need to use Yoroi on my computer to set it up? Sorry for all the questions, I just want to make sure I understand how it works before purchasing a Ledger S.

Random info, but if anyone is having odd issues with node and node sync while also running like me Fedora Server and vnic is vmxnet3. Make sure your running esxi 6.5 U1 at a minimum. Else you get weird hangs and I initially thought it was the node before I dug further into the logs

What does the refund link say exactly? If it failed are you sure it left your wallet ?


[01/24/2022 5:44 PM] Jay#0000
Yes there's a transaction of it going out but no refund


[01/24/2022 5:44 PM] Jay#0000
Refund button just doesn't do anything when you input the address sent from and proxy sent to


[01/24/2022 5:45 PM] glasgowm#0000
Type it in manually

[01/24/2022 6:01 PM] Jay#0000
That generates a txid but the proxy still has the erg on erg explorer


[01/24/2022 6:01 PM] glasgowm#0000

I don't have much experience with the dex but I doubt that went through, maybe there was an issue with the slippage? you can check https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/ with your address and see if you find the tx. if you don't see it I would make a new swap

i refreshed few times already. (re @glasgowm: refresh yoroi then refresh the ergodex page and it should show)


[01/25/2022 8:01 AM] glasgowm#0000
well the tx isn’t pending it has 485 confirmations so it’s just yoroi that’s not loaded it


[01/25/2022 8:01 AM] kulemez#0000
then why it appear still pending on ergodex?


[01/25/2022 8:01 AM] kulemez#0000
because of yoroi?

Anyone still waiting for transaction to go through? Been nearly 24 hours and the status is still saying “submitted”. ADA has left my Yoroi wallet - but has not been received on the other end

Is there a way to config log level of ergo node in Docker? My current default setting is quite noisy.


[01/25/2022 12:19 PM] Σotiris#3516
Kucoin service has been awful these days. Transactions are shown as complete and the txhash is incorrect. I'm not worried, they'll fix it but don't like that delay.


[01/25/2022 12:23 PM] Σotiris#3516
This amplifies the need for more exchanges (CEXs and DEXs),  which the team is working on.

I think we’re at the point with Ergo where introducing the testnet faucet and swapping testnet tokens is just an extra layer of complexity. Do noobs understand that this is a live dex on mainnet? I am on the beach with feet in the sand literally, I can’t edit your post but maybe you might reconsider simplifying to just restoring/creating in yoroi nightly, sending ergo in, swapping to sigusd or whatever and so on


[01/25/2022 3:32 PM] Attila#3944
Also just from a psychological standpoint saying*THIS IS NOT A SCAM DON’T WORRY* usually is a red flag that this is indeed a scam

If you don't have access to the wallet then you can't recover. (re @omid_2256: How do I get there? My wallet recovery words are missing.)


[01/25/2022 6:39 PM] glasgowm#0000
If you have access but forgot the recovery words you can send to a new wallet

You cannot recover with just that. (re @omid_2256: I do not have access. But I know the main password and the date and amount of currency and the date ...)

This sounds like a Cardano issue. Yoroi has been poor at synching etc recently. You can use your same set of seed words to restore to another wallet software (or same hardware device)
Wallets use the same seed words. So you'll be looking at the same wallet address through a different window. You probably won't get Daedalus synched in time for epoch end but you might try cc.vault or Nami, I've heard good things from people (re @Steven: Im having synchronization issues with Yoroi on my phone and desktop. Trying to switch staking pools ...)

Hey,

I'm still having issues claiming ERG from SigUSD, still haven't managed to successfully convert any in like 20 transactions now

The last 2 attempts haven't auto-refunded, the tokens are still at the contract addresses (one of them for over a day now)

Is it possible to get a manual refund or something?

Can someone confirm they've been able to exchange SigUSD for ERG recently?


[01/26/2022 7:21 AM] Tchitombam#0000
I have this tx trying to go thru for half a day now. Its still showing "Submitted" on the wallet but there is no trace of it on the blockchain explorer, not even as pending unconfirmed. Any ideas appreciated. Thank u

Hello, can you make a #romania channel on Global section? 🤔


[01/26/2022 9:44 AM] glasgowm#9381
can see tx going through on ergo.watch so yes

Send proxy address 0.01 erg and refund via link in menu - double the fee when redeeming if your wallet app allows it


[01/26/2022 9:48 AM] soysor#6001
Thanks, my bad didn't see the refund page 😂 

I'm trying with yoroi, it appears to be using the default fee instead of doubling it as far as I can see.

I also tried with the ergo mobile wallet by sending `fee * 2` along with the tokens but I'm not sure if that's the correct way to increase the fee


[01/26/2022 9:49 AM] glasgowm#9381
yoroi should work fine - it sends extra by default


[01/26/2022 9:51 AM] soysor#6001
Maybe that's borked? I'm looking at all my failed txs and the fee is `0.0012 ERG` , I done some successful ones a couple of months ago that all have `0.003 ERG` for the fee - all with yoroi


[01/26/2022 9:52 AM] glasgowm#0000
mines say 0.002 ERG


[01/26/2022 9:54 AM] soysor#6001
What extension version? I'll try updating 🤔

If nothing happens you can probably resync your wallet to the blockchain, the submitted but stuck transaction would disappear and you’d be able to re-submitted the desired transaction (re @stiiif23: Hi Team, Im using Yoroi extension in Chrome.

What are you doing?


[01/28/2022 11:39 AM] teamslow#0524
I was under the impression that the money I put in the liquidity pool was no longer in my wallet but in a smart contract... I put the small amount of liquidity in around November and the wallet has no activity since then, is that expected?


[01/28/2022 11:40 AM] teamslow#0524
I'm also curious -  are messages from somewhere else being relayed to this chat through a bot?  why do so many names have the BOT tag?


[01/28/2022 11:42 AM] glasgowm#9381
yeah it's bridged to telegram.

You should have LP tokens in your assets tab from the dex


[01/28/2022 11:50 AM] teamslow#0524
I do have LP tokens, but t be honest I don't know what to do with them...


[01/28/2022 11:55 AM] glasgowm#9381
Nothing they just represent your stake in the pool. If you redeem you need to send them back


[01/28/2022 12:01 PM] teamslow#0524
if I have stake in the pool shouldnt I see a liquidity position in the ergodex webUI?


[01/28/2022 12:04 PM] teamslow#0524
I didnt think that losing both ends of the liquidity I provided was possible, but again I'm a big noob here and am hoping to learn more so I can understand my risks going forward...


[01/28/2022 12:05 PM] glasgowm#9381
yeah you will you probably just need to refresh yoroi then refresh ergodex


[01/28/2022 12:06 PM] glasgowm#9381

[01/28/2022 3:08 PM] 6directions#1089
Hello. I started syncing a node yesterday and for about 5 hours things ran without any problems.
Then I started getting intermittent `Java heap errors` that make the node crash.
I found some recommendations in the GitHub issues section of the Ergo repo.
Most of them suggest to run the node with the `-Xmx` parameter set to `3G`.
I have tried that, and a few other values too (4 and 5), but eventually I keep getting the same error.

Is there a recommended value that I haven't tried?


[01/28/2022 3:23 PM] glasgowm#9381
Restore on Android wallet and consolidate your UTXOs (send all funds to your own address)


[01/28/2022 3:24 PM] glasgowm#9381
`3G` is recommended, if it happens continuously probably a corruption

Hi all, so we have been listening to issues of people who performed swaps and didn't receive a NETA airdrop. We are currently investigating the issue.
Anyway, if you didn't receive the agreed reward, please DM me with your address and swap transaction ID, we will compile these and airdrop in a few days when we are certain everyone has been accounted for!

Hello,
May I ask you please to help me with this situation that I have...
I've been mining ERGO for some time and I didn't have any problems until now.
Now I have two transactions on https://www.coinex.com/ and both of them have 0 confirmations for a long time.
Thank you in advance for your help,
I'm sending you TXID:

I would suggest trying to restore fresh, if it doesn't work, it may be worth your time to restore in another wallet like ergo mobile wallets or nautilus. (re @AlexShadowsXiii: last sync 14 days ago then i tried manual resync it just wont)

Slippage is how much your price can slip outside the range. So on pools with low liquidity a big order can cause price to change and your order to get stuck

Yeah this is my issue, I'm not sure what the "box fetch failure" is though

hmm my tx are actually all stuck in pending.


[02/03/2022 11:43 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
In safew or yoroi? wallet to wallet tx or DEX? (re @glasgowm: hmm my tx are actually all stuck in pending.)


[02/03/2022 11:43 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
I'll try make one to test

safew, dex tx

@glasgowm - can you help me with this? (re @LuckyRainmaker: Hi. Where can I see the distribution of a specific token (e.g. comet)?)


[02/03/2022 11:55 AM] glasgowm#0000
You cannot see that AFAIK unless you pull it yourself #ergo-stats might be able to help (re @LuckyRainmaker: @glasgowm - can you help me with this?)


[02/03/2022 12:01 PM] LuckyRainmaker#0000
I see. I'm not a dev, so I don't think I can do it myself.
Considering there will be a lot of tokens (neta, ergopad, etc) to be traded on the chain, it will be great if we can see the tokens' distribution on chain (something like cardanoscan or etherscan).

Hello. We are owners of a mini ethereum mining farm. We are interested in mining ergo, but we want to create our own pool to do so. Please, Can you provide us with information regarding my own pool. How  the ergo blockchain will give jobs to my pool? Do i need to install ergo node on my server? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!


[02/03/2022 7:12 PM] erdoge1#0000
how do you reply to these messages. if reply does it bridge my reply from here to discord?


[02/03/2022 7:17 PM] glasgowm#9381
Check out the mining guide on ergonaut.space. I think unless you have a couple GHs you're best mining to a solo pool? 

Given you the mining role. See others in #deleted-channel


[02/03/2022 7:17 PM] glasgowm#9381
@erdoge1 not sure what you mean


[02/03/2022 7:20 PM] Andre05#9319
We have 6.7 ghs of ethereum. This is why i want to make my own pool because i believe i have enough computational power to mine for myself in my own pool. Am i correct?


[02/03/2022 7:21 PM] glasgowm#9381
Not sure what the latest is but that may be enough to make it worthwhile. Erg hash is about double I think too.

[02/03/2022 7:23 PM] Andre05#9319
If i have my own ergo pool, am i getting more money from mining in comparison to mining in someone else's pool?


[02/03/2022 7:24 PM] glasgowm#9381
That's something you'll find in those chats. I would guess yes that it would be worthwhile but not a miner.

[02/04/2022 3:06 AM] erdoge1#0000
Best thing to do now is to use Nautilus Wallet instead.


[02/04/2022 3:06 AM] Arth#0000

[02/04/2022 3:06 AM] Arth#0000

[02/04/2022 3:07 AM] erdoge1#0000
You can restore the same seedphrase of yoroi on Nautilus.


[02/04/2022 3:07 AM] Arth#0000
realy


[02/04/2022 3:07 AM] Arth#0000
?


[02/04/2022 3:07 AM] Arth#0000
how that can worked


[02/04/2022 3:08 AM] erdoge1#0000
the 12 words seedphrase you created when you make a ergo wallet in Yoroi. it work with other ergo wallet too.


[02/04/2022 3:08 AM] erdoge1#0000
just dont give your seedphrase to scammers who private message you.


[02/04/2022 3:08 AM] Arth#0000
the seed phrase wallet is link to the blockchain ?


[02/04/2022 3:09 AM] erdoge1#0000
yes


[02/04/2022 3:09 AM] erdoge1#0000
You can send your ERG to anywhere you want using Nautilus, it doesn't have sync issues like Yoroi.


[02/04/2022 3:10 AM] Arth#0000
if i do that my adresse to received is a new adresse but link to the same wallet in the blockchain ?


[02/04/2022 3:10 AM] Arth#0000
i want to understand how this worked


[02/04/2022 3:11 AM] erdoge1#0000
it's crypto wallet 101. just google how bitcoin seedphrase work. ergo work similarly.


[02/04/2022 3:12 AM] Arth#0000
thx for the information i go to read some article about that


[02/04/2022 3:13 AM] erdoge1#0000
anyone who have your seedphrase can steal your entire wallet, so never give out your seed phrase

Like vultures, they hang around our groups, waiting in silence for a question, or a request for advice, and pop they send you a DM:
Hello, how are you
We apologize for the inconvenience caused on your account
And if you are a newbie, and impressed by the fact that someone responded to you so quickly, or by the name or the correspondent (which many times identifies as one of the group Admins), you respond and the vulture/scammer starts weaving his scam lines around you. 
Guys and gals, never answer anyone who DMs you, offering help, 99 out of 100 cases it will be a scammer; keep safe, wait for someone to answer you here, or write in another group, which may be more appropriate for your problem.
And as for the scammer - open his message and hit Block.
And for you scammers, if you have read this far - do yourself a favor, read something about ERGO, it is a beautiful project, and no matter who you are or what you know - you can be part of it, as an investor, a miner, a developer or as a contributor of ideas. And may the Force be with you!

I’m pretty sure that error is unrelated to the sync and just happens when you try and visit with https in browser (re @odiseus_me: )

Nice that he has anon_br as an info.
Anyway. The error message is thrown by Android itself. The way I understand it it would say that authentication is turned off, and when that is done it won't work any more for apps. Usually it will also need to restore the wallet when you turn it on again. You don't need to delete the wallet from the app, just restore it and save to overwrite it will repair (re @LuckyRainmaker: Nope.)

Ok. I'll restore the wallet. This is after I tried ergopay, btw. Do you think it got something to do with this? (re @MrStahlfelge: Nice that he has anon_br as an info.

Try this. Uninstall Yoroi Nightly, wipe cookies, cache, etc, close browser. Install fresh version of Yoroi Stable. Restore only one Ergo seedphrase, don't restore Cardano wallet. Let wallet fully synced. Now try connecting to ErgoDex.

Also you might want to collect dust and send all assets to one of your wallet address.

Have you checked on the Explorer? Auction contract actually ensures that you are getting your bid back when outbidded (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <Plue> I placed a bid on Ergo Auctions for this piece on the 28th and got outbid. The FAQ said that funds would be immediately be returned in that event but it has been about 4 days now. https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/specific/44bea0d70cff89766a8882f2da4479057d72921c5aab09699a1822bac49cd363)

the hard drive I had my full-node on had to be reformatted. Its currently syncing now but I don't see my balance when i restore my wallet on yoroi or the ergo app wallet. I can see the address where my ERGO is in my yoroi Receive Address Book but the balance is not showing up. Do i have to wait until i get a full sync to get access to my ERGO? Or is something else going on?


[02/06/2022 8:14 PM] glasgowm#9381
You need to derive the next addresses in swagger and yeh won't see your erg until they're synced


[02/06/2022 8:15 PM] nox071218#1778
so i swagger i use wallet/derivenextkey?

Dropping the amount being transferred by one token did allow the transaction to complete. Odd this has just recently come up as the app always auto negotiated the charge with out me needing to do anything.


[02/09/2022 10:29 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
It's an edge case that we still need to tackle. It is happening when for sending the stuff a box is selected that contains exactly the needed erg amount, but more tokens than needed so they need to be sent back to your address. To do this, an erg amount is needed but not available. That's why changing the amount helps: it will make either another box get selected or room for the change. (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <rniedosmialek> Dropping the amount being transferred by one token did allow the transaction to complete.

[02/10/2022 8:15 PM] Awesome#0000
I’ll throw my question out here in case anyone can answer: How do I find my wallet address or staking key?  I tried using one of my user generated receive addresses and that didn’t work.  This is what I am trying to do: “1. Please enter a Cardano wallet address or staking key which belongs to the same Cardano wallet you intend on making payment from.”


[02/10/2022 8:32 PM] kushti_ru#0000
If a question is about Ergo on Yoroi, you can ask it here for sure (re @Awesome: We’re can i go to ask a question on Yoroi (according to ergo support screener, this isn’t the place for it))

Cool!  I was told to: 1. Please enter a Cardano wallet address or staking key which belongs to the same Cardano wallet you intend on making payment from. But when i generated a receive address from my wallet and put that in the field I was given an error message.  Can I find this info elsewhere on my Yoroi app? (re @kushti_ru: If a question is about Ergo on Yoroi, you can ask it here for sure)


[02/10/2022 8:38 PM] Awesome#0000
I can’t seem to find out my staking key in the Dashboard, transaction,send, receive or delegate tab, nor in the settings…so I have no idea where else to look to get this info


[02/10/2022 9:04 PM] glasgowm#0000
That isn’t about ergo - please go to the cardano group that was prompted. This is only listed on Yoroi website for support as Ergo is on yoroi.

A yoroi wallet and a Nautilus wallet are the same, if you take your mnemonic (15 word recovery seed phrase) for the wallet in Yoroi, go into Nautilus and add a new wallet->recover, use that mnemonic and you can then use Nautilus for that same wallet.

The wallets not in the wallet app, it's on the Blockchain, the apps both just access it

if you have it restored in another wallet try to send all assets to the wallets address. This creates an internal transaction that "cleans" up your wallets structure.

Too many boxes. Restore your seed in the mobile wallet or nautilus.


[02/18/2022 7:26 AM] root7Z#8699
Nautilus, Mobile Wallets, Yoroi, answered in general


[02/18/2022 2:35 PM] macste#0000
Are the number of wallets at the on chain metrics of ergo watch unique wallets (xPubs) or are these just wallet addresses where one wallet can have multiple addresses?


[02/18/2022 2:39 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Must be the latter, because xpubs aren't known


[02/18/2022 3:06 PM] macste#0000
In my point of view this is misleading. Cant we show unique wallets?


[02/18/2022 3:08 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
How would that be any better? Unique wallets can belong to the same person as well


[02/18/2022 3:09 PM] macste#0000
I aggree but this number looks like we grew 100.000 unique wallets while we just have 10k for example because everyone created multiple addresses


[02/18/2022 3:10 PM] macste#0000
I dont like the term wallet address


[02/18/2022 3:10 PM] glasgowm#0000
There is no ‘number of wallets’ on ergo.watch, only number of addresses


[02/18/2022 3:10 PM] macste#0000
We know what wallet address means (re @glasgowm: There is no ‘number of wallets’ on ergo.watch, only number of addresses)


[02/18/2022 3:10 PM] glasgowm#0000
who’s we


[02/18/2022 3:10 PM] macste#0000
But people who doesnt have that much knowledge will understand it wrong


[02/18/2022 3:11 PM] glasgowm#0000
idk what you mean it doesnt say wallet address either. Says addresses then ‘number of unique P2PK addresses'


[02/18/2022 3:12 PM] macste#0000
What does unique p2pk adress mean?


[02/18/2022 3:13 PM] glasgowm#0000
unique public address

[02/18/2022 3:14 PM] macste#0000
In my point of view there should be a metric for unique wallets in addition to p2pk


[02/18/2022 3:15 PM] macste#0000
This would reflect the adoption of ergo more likely than just adresses which can be created very easily in one wallet


[02/18/2022 3:15 PM] glasgowm#0000
I’m sure they’re aware of the metric, probably just harder to track


[02/18/2022 3:16 PM] macste#0000
Is there a unique identifier for wallets? Maybe they can track the number of this unique identifiers


[02/18/2022 3:17 PM] macste#0000
I think that the number of unique wallets is a good metric to set goals for the future

you can use the same seedkeys to launch your nightly wallet on regular yoroi without sending

also you can launch your nightly wallet funds on Nautilus it's a lot faster than Yoroi https://docs.ergodex.io/docs/user-guides/nautilus-quick-start

Tried with 3g, same thing. It's strange, it doesn't crash or running out of resources (at least no indication) seems to stuck in the loop , in the api call (//localhost:9053/info) nothing changes but the currentTime, fullHeight = 563600 and other params "seem normal" readings (e.g. fullBlockScore, genesisBlockID, etc.) Any idea, seen that happening before somewhere?

There's never funds in a wallet, all funds are on the blockchain. Wallets just let you use your seed phrase to create a key and access them

Sent an erg (twice?) to a covert address in the mixer, and it just keeps queueing up new ergs - more and more showing up. Can't withdraw them, I try but they just say "Generating transaction" and nothing ever changes. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong? they always say "queued" never "running"

it's happens on every 2-3 transactions, that i have sent 1 assets but my transaction shows that i have sent 2-4 assets, is this yoroi glitch or this means  something different ?


[02/28/2022 9:33 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
This is just how UTXO works, when sending a transaction, you spend all funds in the BOX, if that contains tokens or change, that will then be sent back to you.

Hello guys! In my country mining has a very bad light because of its energy consumption. But that is actually not a problem, because one can use renewable energy which has 0 emission. Moreover mining can generate income as means to accelerate investments in renewables.

Since then I am thinking of a community initiative for creating streams of income and proving my point. So I decided to initially start with a traditional LLC and later, when it is sufficiently decentralized, convert it into a DAO. But I am not sure how to legally bind company shares to a token on the ERGO blockchain. 

Here is the GitHub repo to my initiative. https://github.com/gnuion/dedao

Hey guys, I know it's not the greatest time to report a problem, however there were no new blocks mined in over 30 minutes. The network seems to be stuck at height 705520

[03/16/2022 6:37 PM] glasgowm#9381
Payouts from where? sigmausd site? Should'nt have let you


[03/16/2022 6:37 PM] glasgowm#9381
but there's a refund link in the menu


[03/16/2022 6:39 PM] D3473R#7900
Yes from sigmausd, i not sure if it was my fault, i had a different wallet configured to receive the funds, so not the same that had the Sigusd tokens. I'll try the refund thanks


[03/16/2022 6:41 PM] glasgowm#9381
You can follow the tx on explorer - will either be in the receiving wallet or a proxy contract

It's possible with android, not yoroi

👍 

[03/17/2022 12:06 PM] D3473R#7900
But it doesn't have to be as high as the conversion fee right? Just a little more than 0.01


[03/17/2022 12:08 PM] Geoferdi#0000
some idea about "Mi Goreng Token"?


[03/17/2022 12:20 PM] glasgowm#9381
yes you need a little extra for the proxy contract - think yoroi just sends higher by default


[03/17/2022 12:22 PM] D3473R#7900
I've just sent the suggested conversion fee but it still failed. To I need to send the suggested fee + something extra?


[03/17/2022 12:23 PM] glasgowm#9381
just the sigusd tokens


[03/17/2022 12:26 PM] glasgowm#9381
btw the rate is much better on the dex


[03/17/2022 12:27 PM] glasgowm#9381
100 SigUSD =
29.8 ERG on SigmaUSD
35.4 ERG on ErgoDex


[03/17/2022 12:37 PM] D3473R#7900
Okay, thanks. I even send 1 ERG and it didn't go through. I'll use ErgoDex


[03/17/2022 12:42 PM] abashai#9101
Nothing to be concerned about? I've heard of scam tokens on ETH that can potentially give an attacker access to your wallet. While that seems possible, I'm not sure how factual it is. Is it possible to approve incoming transactions in the future?


[03/17/2022 12:44 PM] glasgowm#9381
Just a meme token someone airdropped. Can't give anyone access to your account - not possible to approve transactions afaik

Losing or forgetting seed phrase is very bad. If device you have wallet on gets damaged, stolen, or lost & you don't have your seed phrase then you no longer own your coins. (re @honglieua22: but I forgot my seed)


[03/19/2022 5:36 PM] TypoDaPsycho#0000
So once you get access to your funds, you need to send entire balance to a new wallet (you'll be given new seed phrase, write it down immediately and keep it safe in a couple different locations

[03/20/2022 1:57 AM] WheezyBackports#7260
I can't read any of the console output to see why because it's constantly spammed with seemingly useless and random information. I can't make any sense of the information either.

The balance you see is the sum of all tokens on all derived addresses you derived. Maybe not all addresses derived?

Mhm, maybe I should explain how I set it up. I set up the wallet with read only mode and scanned each qrcode of each address having a certain amount of tokens


[03/21/2022 1:17 PM] Alex#0000
As there was not a qrcode that had the sum of all addresses


[03/21/2022 1:18 PM] Alex#0000
So i see the amount of tokens for each address


[03/21/2022 1:18 PM] Alex#0000
But not the sum of it


[03/21/2022 1:19 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Ah I see. So you set up the wallet as different for the app and have no merged view.
Best is to add the addresses with the extended public key. Delete them all and then add again as read-only, but instead of using a single address use the xpubkey from nautilus


[03/21/2022 1:20 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Then you can derive the addresses and have the view like you want it


[03/21/2022 1:22 PM] Alex#0000
I did it that way as with the single address it did not work. Ill try again later today


[03/21/2022 1:24 PM] WheezyBackports#7260

the stored secrets stored with your fingerprint were deleted, this happens when you change the authentication in device settings. you need to restore from your mnemonic, which is the way to add the wallet to your new device as well

use Nautilus Wallet or SafeW


[03/22/2022 11:31 PM] max#0000
I'm guessing https://ergoutils.org is not working anymore?


[03/22/2022 11:42 PM] pskorey#0000
> *(re @erdoge1)*: use Nautilus Wallet or SafeW 
so does nautilus work with the ErgoDEX as well, I have a yoroi nightly wallet with some swaps


[03/22/2022 11:42 PM] max#0000
nautilus is the recommend wallet by ergodex team


[03/22/2022 11:42 PM] max#0000
i recommend SafeW


[03/22/2022 11:43 PM] max#0000
you will want to make sure you fully disconnect the old wallet and clear browser cache, then disable yoroi, before you connect the new wallet


[03/22/2022 11:44 PM] pskorey#0000
oops, i definitely didn't do that, yoroi still has my info, and i restored to nautilus, it sees my balance


[03/22/2022 11:45 PM] pskorey#0000
delete the wallet in yoroi and clear cache, any reason i can't do that now, delete the extension as well?


[03/22/2022 11:46 PM] max#0000
you could if you want, there was a previous bug where ergodex still think i was connected to an address i already disconnected which is why i recommend the above

Not sent enough for the fee


[03/24/2022 8:37 AM] alin#1301
Well when you redeem sigRSV you have to send the exact amount of sigRSV to the address indicated. And the transaction went through. But nothing came back


[03/24/2022 8:40 AM] alin#1301
The issue is with the refund button - minimal ERG value not met. Can a dev take a look at this?


[03/24/2022 8:43 AM] glasgowm#9381
Issue with not sending enough for the fee. Send 0.01 erg and refund.

Hi! Can someone explain to me how to import an Ergo Wallet in Eternl? How are the networks compatible?


[03/29/2022 3:19 AM] cardelayno#0000
It's not. Ergo blockchain is separate from Cardano blockchain, so you can not import Ergo wallet into Eternl which support Cardano only.


[03/29/2022 3:20 AM] cardelayno#0000
For Ergo, you can use Nautilus Wallet on desktop, or "Ergo Wallet" for mobile phone.


[03/29/2022 3:24 AM] AgusIzzo#0000

thanks for your answer! Being that way, how do I move my cNeta from Ergo Wallet to a wallet that supports Minswap?


[03/29/2022 3:25 AM] cardelayno#0000
cNeta is a Cardano token, it can only exist in Cardano wallets.


[03/29/2022 3:25 AM] cardelayno#0000
If you have Neta in your Ergo wallet, it is Neta, which is an Ergo token.


[03/29/2022 3:25 AM] cardelayno#0000
There is no bridge to swap between Neta and cNeta yet.


[03/29/2022 3:28 AM] AgusIzzo#0000

omg. I feel like a fool. you are right, they are Neta token


[03/29/2022 3:28 AM] AgusIzzo#0000
Sorry


[03/29/2022 3:29 AM] cardelayno#0000
There will be staking for Neta (on ergo) in the future, and it will have fee earning, and voting rights. I suggest just holding onto it.


[03/29/2022 3:33 AM] CryptoCollector73#0000
Is there anywhere to stake and earn our Ergo coins?

@Gazza_SP …Need some help!  My Yoroi crashed and when I went to recover my wallet I realized I was missing the last 3 words of my 15 word mnemonic.  I have a programmer working on the problem and he is asking me two things I don’t know.  1) The easiest possible way to put in a 15 word mnemonic and get quick feedback on whether its correct or not. 2) An algorithm for generating (or verifying) the fifteenth word based on the previous fourteen, since it is a check sum.  Do you know the answer to either of those or have any other ideas of how I could recover my wallet?  My understanding is because it is three and not four or more there is a slight possibility it can be done.  I am 🙏🏼.  Thanks.

[03/31/2022 8:10 AM] Gazza_SP#5835
I don't have an answer to either of these, my advice is to use the mnenomic dictionary, there's a list of possible words there that can narrow down your bruteforcing options
https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-wallet/blob/master/src/main/resources/wordlist/english.txt

After that, nautilus wallet will allow you to paste in a complete seed phrase into the wallet instead of typing each one so you might be able to use that to check quicker. I have no idea about your second point though, someone else in here might be able to help more. Good luck though I hope you get into it!

what are you trying to mix? erg or a native asset? what ring?


[04/05/2022 9:22 AM] arkadias#4896
erg


[04/05/2022 9:22 AM] arkadias#4896
went through 3 rounds and never progressed so i withdrew it and it never happened either


[04/05/2022 9:22 AM] arkadias#4896

what size ring did you use, 1erg, 10, 100, etc


[04/05/2022 9:24 AM] arkadias#4896
250 erg


[04/05/2022 9:24 AM] arkadias#4896
otherwise i would write it off


[04/05/2022 9:25 AM] glasgowm#9381

[04/05/2022 9:26 AM] arkadias#4896

they all finished and this one is doing nothing


[04/05/2022 9:27 AM] glasgowm#9381
hmm not sure then - are you sure the total isn't correct in your wallet? sometimes they can hang in the UI even if they've been successful


[04/05/2022 9:27 AM] arkadias#4896
yeah no erg in the withdraw address set from mixer


[04/05/2022 9:29 AM] arkadias#4896
idk what to do last thing anon2020s said was that it needs to go through one more mix to finish and it could happen at any time but to message him if it didn't within a couple of days, that was almost a week ago

hello, please i need help to restore my yoroi wallet.. when i set it up for the first time they where 14 WORDS to restore, but now it is asking me to put 15 words


[04/05/2022 11:52 PM] cardelayno#0000
how many possible words are used in seedphrase, 2048 for bip39 standard. so unless you know what the 15th word is, you will have to guess 2048 times to recover your wallet.

Yoroi is so unresponsive / not being able to sync again   that it legitimatelly frustrating to use

At this point i am not able to retrieve my wallet no matter what


[04/08/2022 11:07 PM] Terremot#4855
If you know your seed phrase, just open a nautilus wallet and import the seed phrase


[04/08/2022 11:07 PM] Radioactive#7078
the 15 word seed phrase will work there??


[04/08/2022 11:07 PM] Radioactive#7078
my wallet is really old


[04/08/2022 11:07 PM] Terremot#4855
It will work with any wallet that supports ergo


[04/08/2022 11:08 PM] Terremot#4855
you can even create your own node and node wallet


[04/08/2022 11:08 PM] Terremot#4855
the wallet is effectively only a UI for the information stored behind the seed phrase

Question for you..

Is anyone familiar with an Ergo address that starts with "AXC"? 

I know it's a random question so let me explain.. I'm going through all my transactions (gotta love taxes), and I see a trasaction of a substatial amount of ERG leaving my wallet to an address that starts with AXC. I can't for the life of me track this down. I thought maybe it was the SigmaBank but I did not recieve the SigRSV and the protocol says no funds to refund. 

Every address I have across many wallets, starts with "9".  So I'm hoping someone might now if there's a contract/protocol that starts with "AXC"

@glasgowm  are there pages where it tells about why scala is chosen, or if blocktime is gonna be reduced and stuff like these?


[04/11/2022 10:09 AM] glasgowm#9381
blocktime won't be reduced, it's a parameter set in stone - can be made less noticeable to the end-user with sub-block confirmations. 

Scala is highly scalable, useful for building fault-tolerant, highly concurrent systems


[04/11/2022 10:09 AM] kii#8888
oooh sub block that's cool. Is there somewhere to read about this?

Why Scala over Haskell btw


[04/11/2022 10:14 AM] glasgowm#9381
Haskell does some things better and is purer, but scala is more practical for use (and established for building highly scalable systems). I remember in my Haskell course we started a few of the lessons with (`now, you'd never actually use Haskell for this`) 😅


[04/11/2022 10:14 AM] glasgowm#9381
Scala 3 is also more Haskell-like

With Scala, you can use old, proven and at the same time maintained frameworks made in Java, like bouncycastle

Not many cryptographic frameworks with those properties at all, and there were no any option for Haskell when development was started, dunno about now

```This is a huge issue right now for everyone using Yoroi, which i assume are lots of Erg's early adopters as Yoroi was one of the only options at first.We need to let everyone who uses Yoroi know the following:• YOUR ERG IS SAFE• YOROI IS JUST AN INTERFACE TO TALK TO YOUR COINS• YOROI IS BROKEN FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST YOU• YOU CAN RESTORE YOUR ERG WALLET TO ANOTHER WALLET APP USING THE SAME SEED PHRASE YOROI GAVE YOU• IF YOU DO NOT HAVE YOUR SEED PHRASE, YOU EITHER NEED TO WAIT FOR YOROI TO FIX THEIR ISSUE OR FIND A WAY TO EXPORT SEED PHRASE FROM YOROI (NOT SURE IF POSSIBLE)```

?? No leaf token on ergo


[04/13/2022 11:20 AM] rainboww666#0000
Yoroi wallet


[04/13/2022 11:22 AM] cardelayno#0000
that's a Cardano token, you need ADA to pay for transactions on Cardano.


we do not support Cardano here

That screen shot above is the same error I'm hearing about right now

workaround is also above :)

Very nice it worked for him. Should I tell him to change it back to defaults at some point or is that IP a permanent node

go to ergodex, it's on there


[04/13/2022 11:02 PM] liquid_phase#4605
they probably mean something like pancake swap


[04/13/2022 11:25 PM] cardelayno#0000
there's just no longer a need for that once we have bridges and usdt tokened on ergochain. make them come to us.


[04/13/2022 11:26 PM] liquid_phase#4605
While i appreciate this optimism, lowering the barriers of entry to the ecosystem is in our best interests, even if that means other types of dex's and cex's pairings


[04/13/2022 11:27 PM] cardelayno#0000
i know gton is doing their thing but why bring your coin into an inferior chain with less security and high gas fee

I believe official ergo app for iOS is still in the test phase.

Here's all the wallets https://docs.ergoplatform.com/dev/wallet/


[04/14/2022 5:05 PM] liquid_phase#4605
it is only installable as a testflight beta, becase in order to have the official one on the app store apple requires a verified bank account.

The iOS app is complete and very usable - just needs to be installed via testflight


[04/14/2022 5:06 PM] CEO000#0000
Alright, I will download the TestFlight then now.

ergo wallet mobile have a cold storage feature, basically you  restore the seed phrase on an offline phone not connected to the internet and keep it locked at home, and use that phone to sign transaction for a read only wallet which you restore in your regular phone.

[04/17/2022 5:27 PM] GhostCBuster#2855
i'm not sure but sounds like it's tied up in the auction smart contract - possibly until the auction ends and if you didn't win then it refunds? 

I have no idea, i just started using the auctionhouse

Hi guys, I know Ben Schultz made ergo wallet for android and could be used as a hardware wallet and an old android device (not too old)


[04/19/2022 12:11 PM] OlNick#0000
Is there any way to get this to work with ergoDEX


[04/19/2022 12:11 PM] OlNick#0000
of is it best as just a vault


[04/19/2022 12:28 PM] glasgowm#0000
I believe you can pair it with SAFEW and sign from SAFEW via the dApp connector - from the cold wallet. But not used it myself so we need a tutorial)


[04/19/2022 12:29 PM] OlNick#0000
havent used safeW either , I'll look into it though, if it can work I'll be off to buy a new android phone to use it with


[04/19/2022 12:30 PM] OlNick#0000
I know there is a great page for a bunch of links to ergo stuff, like wallets and projects, but I lost my link to it, dunno where I'm thinking do you?

 I used it and it works great. There are caveats though, as it does not relay through a server but generates the transaction on client it works only for transactions with not much Inputs/outputs, otherwise data is too much for the qr code


[04/19/2022 1:01 PM] OlNick#0000
theres a way to reduce the inputs/ouputs by sending everything back to the same wallet isnt there?


[04/19/2022 1:03 PM] OlNick#0000
I just added my main wallet to be read only so I can keep watch on it on my phone and its missing about 2/3 of the erg there should be , this is however aneta wallet

 You’ll need to derive additional addresses - can do it from within the mobile wallet

 Wallet config -> Addresses -> derive more


[04/19/2022 1:17 PM] OlNick#0000
Yes I think thats what I will have to do, pretty regularly too as I mine into that address


[04/19/2022 1:17 PM] OlNick#0000

Hello, Having a bit of an issue restoring a full node wallet 4.0.23. I tried to restore my mnemonic in a node that was having some issue and I keep getting a message saying "cannot restore wallet during pruning" (tried in main wallet initialization section in the node and then through swagger) so I figured i try restoring in other devices as a test until I figured this out. I also tried as a test to restore the mnemonic in yorio and the android app and when I do I get a completely different main address, tried to derive addresses and after 80 the main node wallet address still hasn't been found. Any ideas?


[04/20/2022 4:44 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
On a side note, I had a previous android wallet that was setup in the android app that I tried to restore and when I entered the mnemonic for that one again in the same android app It also showed a different main address and the original address could not be found when trying to derive new addresses. Any help or explanation as to why this would happen would be appreciated. Thanks.

Failed to access storage. Yoroi needs to access to storage ("IndexedDB") to properly manage wallets. Your browser may either not support IndexedDB or it may be disabled due to your privacy settings (such as private browsing)

[04/20/2022 6:38 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
Hi, thanks for the reply, I discarded that android wallet, I had setup a few and this was the only one that had an issue with not restoring correctly (i usually restore after setup to confirm it valid) so I wasn't sure if it was an issue or I possibly didn't confirm something so no worries there.


[04/20/2022 6:39 PM] 0xMNITY#6979

 When you created the wallet you confirmed to have it written and stored at a safe place. Use that notice to restore


[04/23/2022 3:36 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
When using biometrics and someone removes or changes the device authentication settings the saved secrets are deleted.

What should we do about wall tokens in the yoroi wallet?


[04/24/2022 1:09 AM] liquid_phase#4605
Restore using another wallet like Nautilus using your seed phrase/mnemonic.

Yoroi doesn't hold the tokens, it just accesses them - they are safe on the blockchain and you can use another wallet to access them as long as you have that seed phrase/mnemonic

Hi everyone I am new here as well as new to fiddling with nodes and all that. I wanted for fun to install a node off the raspberry Pi(lol). So I got the node setup. The first thing I saw when running was. It couldn’t  get factory not sure if that’s a problem. Then it started applying best headers/ modifiers. I let it run for a couple of hours and eventually got some folders. Though I also noticed my peers  misbehaving and getting penalized plus the whole send message and processing 399 non-Tx env. As well as the occasional not allows to have duplicate modifiers.   Is this normal behaviour when syncing? Cause it’s been a couple hours now and no completed sync.

There's a dedicated Pi server in #👉〘start・here〙 - requires a bit of tinkering but even best case scenario it'd take a day+ to sync. 

All those errors sound normal though - providing the height is still increasing

I see this error when I try to run FreezeCoin.scala:

Hi Ergo Community, Can we use the Original Ergo wallet (Android/Desktop) & see & transfer the balance even in case the Ergo Wallet, Spending Password & Wallet Name was originally created on Yoroi web & has balance.


[04/27/2022 5:35 PM] glasgowm#0000
Restore in the ergo wallet (ios/android) or nautilus. You don’t need your password only your seed phrase

 Once yoroi is fixed, can I use ergo wallet (or) nautilus (or) yoroi's ergo wallet simultaneously. Whether all balance & transfer logic work on all together without any problem.

 What do you mean by "derive some new addresses in-app"


[04/27/2022 6:44 PM] glasgowm#0000
wallets have many addresses, if you perform transactions and generate a bunch of addresses you might need to generate new ones in app.


[04/27/2022 6:47 PM] Naveen54321#0000
So for example, I have only one address registerd on yoroi's extension having 100 Ergo's. So are you saying the same will remain the same when I restore wallet on ergo (or) nautilus (or) it will change


[04/27/2022 6:48 PM] glasgowm#0000
remain the same


[04/27/2022 6:48 PM] glasgowm#0000
but if you send 5 transactions and end up with 60 erg in 6 addresses you might need to generate 5 new addresses next time youre in yoroi to see it


[04/27/2022 6:52 PM] Naveen54321#0000
> Naveen54321 re @glasgowm: but if you send 5 transactions and end up with... 
 
 Okay, so let me ask with an example, I have 100 Ergo's & have only 1 wallet address. In my case, since I have only 1 address with 100 Ergo's in it, i hope the above condition (or) restrictions does not apply to me even in case I have 50 transactions, since all were carried from single address.

Hello


[05/02/2022 6:24 AM] Shankar Vembu Aky#0000
Is there a way to recover a seed phrase with one missing word?


[05/02/2022 7:03 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
The list of words is public and linked in the wallet app. You can try every word.


[05/02/2022 8:16 AM] Shankar Vembu Aky#0000
I already did. The thing is i got my complete seed phrase but when im typing it to the wallet to recover one word is not showing in the "public words".


[05/02/2022 8:17 AM] Shankar Vembu Aky#0000
I know i got a correct set of seed phrase because I literally write it in paper and copy pasted it. That's why im confused on why it is not working.


[05/02/2022 8:45 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Which wallet application are you trying to restore it to?


[05/02/2022 8:47 AM] Shankar Vembu Aky#0000
I got ERGO


[05/02/2022 8:49 AM] Shankar Vembu Aky#0000
For the past day I've been trying different word hoping to recover my wallet. Actually, I've open 5 different wallets from trying different words.


[05/02/2022 8:57 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
And which application you try to restore to? Nautilus? Yoroi? Node? Mobile wallet?


[05/02/2022 9:15 AM] Shankar Vembu Aky#0000
Yoroi Chrome


[05/02/2022 9:15 AM] Shankar Vembu Aky#0000

Hello, I was setting up a fresh node and it looks like the instructions are a bit different now https://docs.ergoplatform.com/node/install/ so  I just had a quick question. When I issue the command to run the node for the first time (windows) I was getting an error with "-Dlogback.stdout.level=WARN -Dlogback.file.level=ERR" those flags, also the ergo.jar isn't specified as a specific version which in previous versions the version needed to be specified i.e "ergo-4.0.27.jar". So I am wondering if I got an error with those flags because I specified a version of the jar? and I should run the command without specifying the version instead or do you need to specify the version?


[05/05/2022 6:56 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
I wound up running: java -jar -Xmx4G ergo-4.0.27.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf


[05/05/2022 6:57 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
and it worked but running java -jar -Xmx4G -Dlogback.stdout.level=WARN -Dlogback.file.level=ERR ergo-4.0.27.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf

[05/05/2022 7:01 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
On a side note, I had asked previously about restoring a light node wallet, and I restored it to this node and got the correct address so that seems to be working good also so that problem I had is now fixed too. Nice job on the new website BTW whoever designed that did a good job.

Hi Ergo Support/Developers, ETH will soon be completely PoS in a couple of days & everyone will start migrating to different coins. I really hope Ergo has the capacity to handle this without any profit reduction. I hopefully prey that Ergo price goes up & up as much as possible.

Hello. Not sure if this is the right place to be asking or not. However, I have an ERGO wallet that had 2 gnomekins in it. I hadn't checked it for a long time and recently was trying out the Sky Harbor website, and noticed that one of them will not load. I tried on the Ergonfts org site and it is the same. There is a broken image and it either times out or just doesn't load. The metadata is in there though. In the past, it used to be OK, as I have viewed it there before. Any ideas what has happened and how I can fix it? Thank you.


[05/08/2022 6:14 AM] liquid_phase#4605
I have noticed that with very large image files that IPFS does not really do well with them during high congestion.

[05/08/2022 10:39 AM] ChrisBTheYUProf#1594
Thank you for the explanation. I will try again tomorrow and see if it is any better. I wouldn't have thought the gnomekin NFT image files would be that big as a lot of them are visible. Thanks for the reply. Will check it out. 😍 🙏


[05/08/2022 6:52 PM] liquid_phase#4605
not sure if its just IPFS having issues, but fwiw i havent been able to see my NFTs for a couple days now. they're in the wallet, but the actual image link is broken. They probably still havent implemented any form of compression or caching, as that would add resource congestion to their already limited network...

Scroll down to the bottom, lots of good alternatives.
Click each wallet to go to official wallet page to download from. 
Disable Yoroi but DO NOT delete until you have restored funds on new wallet. 
I really like SAFEW or Nautilus on desktop. 
Mobile wallets good too.

That doesn't really answer my question. Being able to recover a private key/mnemonic should be a wallet feature.

 onchain code is ergoscript where you already found information for. so, it is what you need but not everything if you want to design your own smart contracts. and it is not exlusive as the offchain code can be done in a programming language of your choice


[05/13/2022 8:47 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000

I got this error when using refund menu: "requirement failed: Minimal ERG"
What should i do now?
@anon_real


[05/14/2022 7:52 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Usually it helps to sent some small amount of erg to the address


[05/14/2022 7:54 PM] glasgowm#9381
how did you send ? Use the dApp connector/ergo-pay. You need to send enough erg for the tx fee so it can refund


[05/14/2022 7:56 PM] fateme.r#4033
Used proxy address.
Is there a problem with proxy?


[05/14/2022 7:56 PM] glasgowm#9381
no but you need to send extra erg to cover the tx fee


[05/14/2022 7:57 PM] fateme.r#4033
What's the problem of sigusd? Will it work next time? Or does it have a problem now?


[05/14/2022 7:59 PM] glasgowm#9381
It will work next time if you send extra erg with it.


[05/14/2022 8:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
send 0.01 erg with the tokens when redeeming


[05/14/2022 8:01 PM] fateme.r#4033
Ok thanks a lot.

I sent 4 erg  from the yoroi wallet to the mobile ergo wallet yesterday.   It has stolen shown up in my mobile wallet.

[05/14/2022 8:33 PM] glasgowm#0000
Yoroi probably never sent it, just restore with your seed in the mobile wallet.


[05/14/2022 8:42 PM] BuckSkin#6730
It says processing


[05/14/2022 8:43 PM] BuckSkin#6730
I can still access my yorio wallet.  How do I restore with my seed phrase?

I lost my passphrase , I want to transfer my ergo in Yoroi wallet , But yoroi error :( I lost my ergo :(


[05/15/2022 9:09 AM] Bekoey21#0000
please discuss with them so we can take ergo in yoroi wallet


[05/15/2022 9:09 AM] glasgowm#0000
Please try the steps described at the end of 2) here. Resyncing wallet, disable and reenable plugin. Yoroi works it's just very slow. 
Failing that is there anything else that could be done @anon_br ?

Download latest version of node, then delete /history, /peers, /wallet/registry and /state.
Then start up your node and let it resync, should work after that

Anyone else having big issues with Yoroi Wallet? I have like 50 failed transactions and a bunch of missing transactions.


[05/21/2022 5:52 AM] tflynn#6411
generaly advice would be to not use yoroi. just import into a wallet that actually works


[05/21/2022 5:55 AM] New England Crypto#5506
Good to know.. Yoroi had been working find for months... crazy. It was what was suggested back when I 1st started mining it


[05/21/2022 6:14 AM] tflynn#6411
its especially sucks if you have many eutxos in the wallet... say from mining rewards. if you make a tx to send all your ergo to yourself it will speed up yoroi. but my advice is still to just use a different wallet

[05/21/2022 11:26 AM] glasgowm#0000
No sir Ergo is working well, Yoroi is having sync issues but if you restore in another wallet it’ll work fine.

 Yes, your keystore file is your wallet, back it up

good morning guys.  It's been almost 3 days since I made my withdrawal at Yoroi and so far it hasn't been sent to my wallet.  I've already restored the wallet, installed it on another device, etc… However, it shows that the transaction was carried out, but it still hasn't gone to my wallet.  Does anyone know how to solve this problem?  Thank you all

I did not understand , i did tried to restore the wallet but in the same pc.. not a correct way to do it?

 Restore in a different wallet provider (nautilus/mobile/etc)

the wallet balance are not the same as the chain balance. Last 2 days I transferred my coin from 2miners pool into my yoroi wallet, and that transaction had 400+ confirmation already.. but yoroi wallet balance and not adding up 😦..also i feel like yoroi wallet are so buggy and lagging, my chrome stopped working ( not crashed but it prompt me to wait as it's not responding) just to click on some buttons in the interface


[05/21/2022 2:27 PM] Lailia#0922

You need to use another wallet, yoroi crashed


[05/21/2022 4:21 PM] Marian#0000
Use nautilus wallet for example


[05/21/2022 4:21 PM] Marian#0000
And restore wallet via seed phrase


[05/21/2022 4:23 PM] Peiximcoin#0000
what is the wallet link


[05/21/2022 4:24 PM] Marian#0000
Go to ergoplatform.org and go for the menu wallets


[05/21/2022 4:25 PM] Marian#0000
Then choose one of them. I took nautilus


[05/21/2022 4:25 PM] Marian#0000

you guys are probably already aware, but here goes. Yesterday I tried to sync from scratch a node with versions 4.0.29 and 4.0.28 (mainnet). They are incredibly slow, had to download 4.0.27 to do it

Hi there !  I have a problem with Yoroi for Ergo , i know it is no longer supported  it but i wos unaware of this  and the firefox extension still works , so i generated a new adress and transfered not a small amount of ergo to my wallet . After a few days i checked and nothing . The transaction went thru and can be seen on the blockchain but nothing in my wallet. I tried to restore my wallet on the ERGO mobile app  using the seed phrase but the last transaction did not show.  Is there anything i can do to restore my funds or they are lost forever ?

 Derive additional addresses in the wallet.

No one has access to my computer
No one has access to my password/phrases
No one has access to my phone

And it was transferred to another type of wallet,  it is a Byron Daedalus-style address. They start with DdzF.

That’s normally what it says when you ctrl+c, anything before that? And it’s now doing this straight away from a fresh sync?

 That's what it normally says right before it shuts down after time out.
It runs for a few minutes (10 or so) though before shutting down.
Fresh sync takes more time but ends in the same result.
I tried using some executables from swagger UI and it gives me an error

[05/24/2022 9:31 AM] Brodax_Oficial#0000
why its not finding it?


[05/24/2022 9:31 AM] Brodax_Oficial#0000
do i have to extract the folder in any special place?


[05/24/2022 9:35 AM] Brodax_Oficial#0000
anyone?


[05/24/2022 9:51 AM] Brodax_Oficial#0000
maybe @glasgowm ?


[05/24/2022 10:35 AM] Dario#0000
@glasgowm it finally worked. don't know what the problem was because earlier versions all got stuck. 4.0.30 seems to work though


[05/24/2022 10:36 AM] Dario#0000
didn't use -xmx4g so that was not the solution to the problem


[05/24/2022 11:38 AM] glasgowm#0000
(re @Brodax_Oficial : *do i have to extract the folder in any special place?*) 
 
 you need to run the command from within the folder

The server is failing to start for some reason it's just not giving you an error via the script. Check the .log

I downloaded the Nautilus wallet extension to use it as Testnet on ERGODEX. I noticed that during the installation there is no option to install as TESTNET. After the installation I went to tools to change the network to TESTNET, but there is no such possibility within the Nautilus wallet. How to use Nautilus wallet as TESTNET?

ErgoDex isn’t on testnet, you need an ADA wallet if you want to use the ada testnet.

Hi! I have a problem with Yoroi for Ergo in my Chrome extension. I transferred a considerable amount (personally) of Ergo to my new yoroi wallet. The transaction went thru and can be seen on the blockchain but nothing in my wallet. 
The transaction keep refreshing from pending to failed (for > 1 week). I tried resync or restoring my wallet but it does not help. 
Is there anything i can do for this issue?

well doesn't hurt to try just swapping it out first and seeing if it starts ticking over

i just did the swap and it didn't help. just to be sure that i am using the right version. i downloaded and tested https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/releases/tag/eip27-rc2 and https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/releases/tag/v4.0.26

i hope this is what you meant by rc2 branch :3 i cant find a branch specifically named rc2 in the repo.

 If you have ERG in your wallet send it to an exchange and trade it for ADA.

hello, how long does ergomixer process the withdraw transaction? I withdrew my erg after 2 rounds and now am stuck with “transaction being generated” for 3 hrs now


[06/07/2022 2:12 PM] liquid_phase#4605
ergo and ADA are not the same crypto currency, even though they have lots in common and share alot of goals.


[06/07/2022 5:53 PM] Alexg#3768
after chain split , I was able to sync 4.0.30 version with

Hi Ergo Team, Mining profits are so much low that some miners have almost stopped mining since electricity bill is more than profits. I am probably going to be one of them soon if the trend continues. But, Do you think there is still hope for profits (or) coin value to rise/increase in any future with the current situations ?

Hello 🤟 I'm trying to send tx programmatically, using node and ts. Tried coinbarn/ergo-ts and ergo-lib-wasm-nodejs libraries with same results - getting tx id in response and that's it. Balance not changed, tx with this id not found. Am i missing some next step, is coinbarn working? Maybe someone has working example of such script - send tx with secret key? Is there other libraries to do this and why API responds with tx id if nothing happens?

[06/18/2022 11:00 AM] Siegfried#2220
I believe this was the TX I tried to mint SigRSV. https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/68cb2373e3deec6cd9e49529f9e4cb4344e54d9a739105ea90866f280bd7d58b


[06/18/2022 9:36 PM] Siegfried#2220
Ok, after I check the explorer I think the minting SigRSV works like: Pay ERG to proxy address -> Another agent mint the token and send the token back or refund if minting failed
However, this time no token was sent back, and there is no refund as well. I cannot generate the transaction to refund as well due to that error. Can anyone help me understand what's happening? I'm trapped.

Still keep getting that error at some point, even after deleting everything and resyncing.


[06/20/2022 4:26 PM] Strupf#5194
Once I see "readers are not initialised yet" it's done. Maybe setup a new API key?


[06/20/2022 5:01 PM] glasgowm#9381
How frequently are you shutting down? Turning off sleep can help. Even if you use `/shutdown` if the threads haven't had time to shutdown in the bg or they're hanging it can cause a corruption. Are you running with the -Xmx flag?


[06/20/2022 5:04 PM] Strupf#5194
-Xmx8G. Shutting down once a day perhaps.


[06/20/2022 5:07 PM] Strupf#5194
You mean Windows sleep mode or threading sleep on Java?


[06/20/2022 5:09 PM] Strupf#5194
A bit sad because I thought I could support the network easily by keeping it running when I'm on PC. If I can't sort it out I'll just leave it as is and wait for new versions of the client


[06/20/2022 5:10 PM] glasgowm#9381

[06/23/2022 2:40 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Which wallet app are you using? Some of them do not support looking at the seed again past the first time - but the Ergo Mobile wallet app for android and iOS does allow you to view the mnemonic in the wallet settings


[06/23/2022 2:41 PM] Chadwicksracing#6027
I have the Ergo Node wallet


[06/23/2022 2:42 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i do not believe the node allows you to view the mnemonic again after the initial time.

since you have access, you will likely be best off transferring all assets to a new wallet where you firmly copy and keep safe the mnemonic


[06/23/2022 2:43 PM] Chadwicksracing#6027
shoot, I Have dex assets on this wallet


[06/23/2022 2:43 PM] Chadwicksracing#6027
I sore I saved it, but seems it not saved


[06/23/2022 2:43 PM] liquid_phase#4605
dex assets should be able to transfer to another wallet so long as they are ergo native

[06/23/2022 2:53 PM] liquid_phase#4605
The neta needs to be sent along with the erg. does it not show the neta in the node wallet?


[06/23/2022 2:53 PM] Chadwicksracing#6027
its still syncing


[06/23/2022 2:54 PM] liquid_phase#4605
you won't be able to send anything until it syncs. once it syncs it will show the correct balances of erg and neta and anyhing ergo native. it might not properly display the token name as Neta, might be some string of characters

Hi guys, I created a new Nautilus wallet the other day and wanted to access it on another computer. I input my seed phrase but I'm not seeing the same address and I have no funds. Is there a way to view the seed phrase on the original machine to make sure I copied it down correctly? Or is there another reason this might happen? Pretty sure I wrote it down correctly but obviously can't verify 100%.


[06/28/2022 3:12 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
I dont believe Nautilus shows you the seed phrase. So I would assume you wrote it down wrong. In that case I would recommend sending your ERG from your old wallet to a new one (where you correctly write the seed down)

{Reactions}
👍 

[06/28/2022 10:14 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
I got in the habit of, before sending any funds to a new wallet to first delete and restore from seed to confirm it will restore correctly before I send funds to it. Had that happen once before and now paranoid 🙂


[06/28/2022 10:15 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Even better to check signing and sending before using it for the big funds

I'm still trying to run a node, but when it syncs to 90% it starts shutting down. It is normal that it uses all the resources available? I'm running it on a VM on a server with multiple processors, RAM, etc. The most resources I assign to the VM the more it uses.

I usually use 3g but you can use 4 or whatever you want


[06/28/2022 11:53 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
Also, sometime the wallet can slow things down, if you already initialized the wallet, shut down the node.. what I did was can change the name of the keystore folder to something like 'xkeystore'  then restart the node and let it sync without the wallet.. then shut down the node again, change the folder back to keystore and let the wallet sync after the node has fully synced


[06/28/2022 11:59 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
you might get an error for the keystore folder but you can just ignore it, it should still sync the node without it

looks like your conf file is in a different location, it should be in the same directory as the jar file so in your case it would be in c:\ergo

EIP-27 Mainnet Activation Voting and Final Details
EIP-27 got successfully activated @ block # 777,217 . Now the biggest question for pools and miners is how to handle rewards and payments.  In the first place, note that emission in Ergo is done via a contract (releasing ERGs each block according to a schedule set in the contract). After EIP-27 soft-fork,  re-emission tokens are attached to mini...

 You should generate the addresses while syncing, you can also rescan after sync.

Ok, shouldn't the node wallet take care of the reemission? Right now the reward is still in the 88 address. Do I need to send the 12000000 tokens to the reemission address and then the 48 erg will be able to be sent to my address?


[07/07/2022 7:22 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
The node wallet will automatically do this when you spend your reward, nothing for you to do specifically


[07/07/2022 7:27 PM] Babelfish24#2887
When I go to transfer the reward, I get an error.

4.0.32

is that normal


[07/07/2022 7:46 PM] Babelfish24#2887
I thought it would send it to the normal node address


[07/07/2022 7:46 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Well thats okay, the reward doesnt auto transfer to your wallet, your wallet just spends from that address in addition to your normal one


[07/07/2022 7:46 PM] Babelfish24#2887
I see


[07/07/2022 7:46 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
But if you can't spend it that's the real issue


[07/07/2022 7:47 PM] Babelfish24#2887
should I try to send the 12000000 tokens to the eip-27 address?


[07/07/2022 7:47 PM] Babelfish24#2887
"Otherwise, burn re-emission tokens when you have them in (mining rewards) inputs, and send the same number of nanoERGs to pay-to-reemission contract (it P2S address is 6KxusedL87PBibr1t1f4ggzAyTAmWEPqSpqXbkdoybNwHVw5Nb7cUESBmQw5XK8TyvbQiueyqkR9XMNaUgpWx3jT54p for the mainnet)."


[07/07/2022 7:47 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Nah, that won't work and will likely cause problems. There's a specific set of instructions you have to follow and I'm not sure the normal node wallet lets you do it manually


[07/07/2022 7:48 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
It does it automatically usually.

@AllCloudy | GetBlok.ioI hear you are a miningcore god, I'm looking for suggestions for my config.json file. I have an ERGO node setup and just want to mine to my node. I just want the rewards to go to the node wallet. What should I put in the config.json file for that?... Also if I am mining to my own node, should I use varidiff? Or should I just set a static difficulty? Would it be more likely to hit a block with a low static diff like 1.0 if I'm not worrying about network congestion?

Any help would be appreciated 🙂


[07/08/2022 12:25 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Well I wouldn’t say a MC god lol just have lots of bruises 😆.  Let me get a sample, simple, ergo conf that people can use.  we set our vardiff in a way that’s pretty much static.


[07/08/2022 12:28 AM] Babelfish24#2887
Cool I just don't know if I set the payments to false, will it just keep the rewards in the node wallet? And as far as the difficulty goes I have 15 gh across 12 machines and don't know if there is a point of raising the difficulty "to limit network congestion"


[07/08/2022 3:50 AM] Babelfish24#2887
Have you had a chance to create a sample config.json?


[07/08/2022 3:50 AM] Babelfish24#2887

[07/17/2022 11:36 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Try using the refund tab. If you are new though make sure to check the mint address on auction house. There are many fake nfts at the moment there


[07/17/2022 11:44 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
As a new user, I would recommend you join the artists discord or check their website to find out their real mint address and make sure any NFT you buy has this mint address.
Otherwise, if you haven't heard of <https://www.skyharbor.io> feel free to check it out, they have verified collections which do this check for you to make sure any NFT from the collection is authentic.

Phew! Figured it out. Don't know how it happened but when bidding on the auction is transferred everything out of my Nautilus and sent it back to my old yoroi wallet.

[07/18/2022 3:55 AM] liquid_phase#4605
seems like a derived address issue perhaps.

In nautilus, maybe click the new address button a few times

The addresses are derived from a root, and that root address is associated to a seed phrase


[07/18/2022 3:56 AM] liquid_phase#4605
if you restored your yoroi wallet in nautilus, then did a few transfers, nautilus makes automatically new derived addresses for privacy purposes


[07/18/2022 3:56 AM] liquid_phase#4605
so it would still have the yoroi address there, as its not a 'yoroi' address but an ergo address accesible from any ergo wallet


[07/18/2022 3:57 AM] liquid_phase#4605
so if you restored your wallet from yoroi into nautilus using a seed phrase provided by yoroi wallet, then nautilus control that address now. sometimes because of UTXO, funds get sent back and forth between your different boxes/addresses.

getting bad api key when setting up node


[07/18/2022 11:41 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
make sure you are using the latest version. Also, I have seen nodes not accepting api_key during syncing (usually if some aspect of syncing is going wrong) but they resolve once synced usually


[07/20/2022 8:39 AM] Babelfish24#2887
Did you get this fixed?


[07/20/2022 9:00 AM] FlyingPig#2854
Assume you calculated the api hash using swagger first and then entered that in the conf file?


[07/20/2022 11:01 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Hi I tried creating an Ergoraffle and it would continually say invalid captcha no matter how quickly I tried sending the .006 erg to the address.

 Easiest way is to scroll back, it should've sent you it at the start

Sadly I did not. There was a glitch where it didnt respond for a couple days and I never got a password. 😒

Says minimal erg value not met. Need erg in the box for the tx few. Send it 0.1erg and retry

I thought the amount require was .001. I'll try .1.

Ok, the .1 erg transfer was confirmed, but I'm still getting the same error. Also the address in the PaymentRequest doesn't appear in ERGO explorer. Is it possible SigUSD generated an address that's invalid somehow? Here's the TX ID for the .1 erg transfer: 5934375c3b3780c98dc54a96731a189dfb57341b7b7720cdb9d92b9f0445952f.

Hey! I have a strange situation. In May 2022 I installed Ergo Mobile, created a new wallet and received 251 ERGO to 4 different addresses from Ergo Mixer. 
Now I restored a wallet with the seed phrase, but it shows only 2 addresses with funds. The other 2 are gone. I manually added additional addresses (like 20 of them), but all of them are empty.
Did anybody encounter the same mistake? What shall I do?

p.s. If the seed was wrong - all addresses would be empty. But the fact that 2 out of 4 can be seen and the other 2 are gone is confusing.
p.p.s. I have checked addresses derived from m/44'/429'/0'/0/2 and m/44'/429'/0'/0/3 (derived address 2 and 3, which are empty), and they have no transactions according to explorer, so I did not forget that I moved funds somewhere or they were stolen (also stolen from 2 out of 4 is strange).


[08/08/2022 7:58 PM] wombo22#5461
just to confirm the two missing addresses, they also had ergs in them and so now you are missing funds? would that be correct


[08/08/2022 7:59 PM] pa6uk#7509
Yep, that is correct


[08/08/2022 8:04 PM] wombo22#5461
that is indeed quite strange


[08/08/2022 8:04 PM] wombo22#5461
where did you restore the wallet


[08/08/2022 8:05 PM] pa6uk#7509
Ergo Mobile, same wallet I did it in the first place


[08/08/2022 8:07 PM] pa6uk#7509
Installed older version which seems to be active at that time, but it did not help. Though it is also strange - app said "Found 4 used addresses". But only 2 of them with funds again. So it is strange that it see 4


[08/08/2022 8:07 PM] wombo22#5461
hi @MrStahlfelge sorry not sure if this is related to the mobile wallet but has anyone ever brought up this issue before and would you be able to help


[08/08/2022 8:13 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
(re  : *<pa6uk> Installed older version which seems to be active at that time, but it did not help. Though it is also strange - app said "Found 4 used addresses". But only 2 of them with funds again. So it is strange that it see 4*) 
 
 It says 4 addresses because 4 have transactions. When they have 0 balance it means balance has been moved


[08/08/2022 8:16 PM] pa6uk#7509
Explorer does not confirm this version. Same for 2 addresses.

[08/08/2022 8:18 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
This is an address that was automatically created on restore?


[08/08/2022 8:19 PM] pa6uk#7509
Yes


[08/08/2022 8:21 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Okay, I can just say how the wallet works. It restores address 0, and then it cycles up beginning with 1 as long as the found address contains a transaction history. If an address has no past transactions, the loop is done.
So in theory if it restores 4 addresses these all should have past transactions.


[08/08/2022 8:24 PM] pa6uk#7509
So either the explorer is somehow wrong when displaying this info (but wallet can see those txs), or there is some mistake somewhere. How can I check it? I can share all the necessary details if it will help.


[08/08/2022 8:31 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
The wallet requests information from explorer, so this is especially weird.
If you want I can check tomorrow the derivations when you send me your extended public key. But I can do nothing else than what you did. Sometimes the results are different though. 😉


[08/08/2022 8:41 PM] pa6uk#7509
Yep, sure, that would be great. Can you DM me please?


[08/09/2022 3:33 PM] Awdi4Life#9782
Hello, I am not sure if this is the best place to ask but I would like to setup a full node for ergo to support the network. And I am not really sure what would be the best low cost hardware to use? I was thinking maybe a rasberry pi 4  but that's like about 250$ for a starter kit.  I was unsure if there was maybe a better  lower cost option? Any suggestions?


[08/09/2022 3:43 PM] wombo22#5461
rasberry pi's seem like affordable options but which rasberry pi in particular that would be a lower cost is the go to to ask I feel.


[08/09/2022 3:45 PM] wombo22#5461
i would have just forwarded you the ergo pi discord channel but not sure I can


[08/09/2022 3:45 PM] wombo22#5461
let me try actually


[08/09/2022 4:02 PM] Awdi4Life#9782
Well if I bought one I figure why buy older model and then maybe need to update it later and waste more money which is why I suggested the 4 specifically the 8gb but I dunno 250$ seems like a lot to spend on a node that has no rewards as much as I want to support the eco system I don't really have 250 to spare and rather buy more erg lol


[08/09/2022 4:03 PM] wombo22#5461
that makes sense


[08/09/2022 4:03 PM] wombo22#5461
then ya pretty sure a rasberry pi would be the lowest cost option from what I know of but I could be wrong


[08/09/2022 4:05 PM] wombo22#5461
try in the #node channel to see if anyone from there might know of any cheaper options


[08/09/2022 4:06 PM] Awdi4Life#9782
I didn't see a node channel maybe I wasn't paying attention... damn ADHD

You need to enable them in the top channel in each category (best solution until Discord lets you subscribe to channels natively). Enable it in #deleted-channel


[08/09/2022 6:14 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
i believe the rpi foundation is designing a 5 but with the global chip shortage we probably won't see it for awhile. with that said i have one too many 4's but the 4gb is a good sweet spot in terms of versatility, horsepower, and cost


[08/10/2022 12:09 AM] blindrun#0649
how do I recover the mnemonic seed from swagger


[08/10/2022 12:13 AM] kushti#0000
No way, mnemonic shown only once during wallet init, then one way transfornation transforms it into a seed which is stored on node machine in encrypted file


[08/10/2022 12:15 AM] blindrun#0649
aight thanks


[08/10/2022 12:15 AM] blindrun#0649

no just the eip ones, you have them duplicated under scorex line 22 - 34

Lemme know your setup. You're using a stratum server with what? Are you using open source miner? or closed one? By 13 miners you mean 13 GPU connected to one mining software or 13 separate rigs?

13 separate rigs

I have tried, but the balance always comes up zero. I screwed something up in a node update and the blockchain wont sync, I think, and the erg balance isn't increasing to what it should be. I can see the wallet and the correct erg amount is there, but I don't have a way of adding a transaction i don't think to move it out of this node into another wallet if the blockchain/node isn't syncing and updating. I've tried the mnemonic on other wallet's but the balance is always zero...? I don't know what to do next.


[08/14/2022 6:32 AM] blackinsecure#3693
add more addresses using one of the wallets


[08/14/2022 6:32 AM] blackinsecure#3693
not necessarily your erg is in the main address of your wallet


[08/14/2022 6:32 AM] blackinsecure#3693
maybe @MrStahlfelge could help with that


[08/14/2022 8:17 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
If the address is really old, it might be a pre EIP 3 address. Then it can only be restored with the node and a special setting in the config iirc


[08/14/2022 8:36 AM] blackinsecure#3693

[08/14/2022 2:13 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Explorer sometimes has issues. Just retry. Make sure you have a good connection in case you have a lot of small boxes


[08/14/2022 2:14 PM] Pena#8545
Tried with mobile phone 4G and 4G 😂


[08/14/2022 2:14 PM] Pena#8545
10 times fail in a row, I guess I just need to keep trying


[08/14/2022 2:17 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Or reduce the amount to send. Offset 100 means you are already having 100 input boxes and more are not really possible due to costing

Ahh I get it. Reduced and worked fine. Thank you a ton!

Hi. I've added a derived/subaddress with Nautilus wallet and sent my Ergo there from an exchange. But when I restore the wallet in Ergo mobile app my dervied address with my Ergo is not dissplayed. I can only see my main walley address. Why is that?


[08/14/2022 7:59 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Wallet config -> addresses -> derive more


[08/14/2022 9:07 PM] Monkeydeeh#0000
Yes but dosen't this only create more  derived addresses?  I would like to display the address I already created in Nautilus.


[08/14/2022 9:11 PM] Monkeydeeh#0000
Sorry you are correct.  I didn't make enough address so the one with my Ergo coins wasn't displayed. Thank you.

(re @tgw69 : *Hi, I am trying to send a token via Yoroi but get an error message: Error received from server while sending transaction. While I could send it a few moths ago doing the same settings. What to do?*) 
 
 Try a different wallet like Nautilus, SAFEW or mobile wallet. Here's the full list with links
https://ergoplatform.org/en/get-erg/


[08/16/2022 10:41 AM] tgw69#0000

[08/17/2022 4:37 PM] WiZ_D#9063
Hey, can someone explain to me what is the connection between Ergo and the Eth merge?


[08/17/2022 4:38 PM] glasgowm#9381
Ergo is mineable.


[08/17/2022 4:40 PM] WiZ_D#9063
Yes and?


[08/17/2022 4:41 PM] WiZ_D#9063
What is the difference after the merge if it's already mineable now?


[08/17/2022 4:41 PM] glasgowm#9381
The eth merge means ETH will no longer be mineable.


[08/17/2022 4:41 PM] glasgowm#9381
so gpus will look for new homes


[08/17/2022 4:42 PM] WiZ_D#9063
And why would they look for ergo?


[08/17/2022 4:51 PM] Meatball#9519
The overall connection is once ETH is no longer GPU mineable people are going to be looking at _any_ coins that they can still mine and might be profitable.  Some will come to ERG based on the fact they like the project, but there's also a large amount of people that will go to whatever coin is the most profitable.


[08/17/2022 4:51 PM] Meatball#9519
If you look at WhattoMine, at least today, coins like Flux, Neoxa, Ergo are up there in terms of profits and not much below ETH.


[08/17/2022 4:52 PM] Meatball#9519
So, there's not really a direct connection per se other than you'll have a lot of hash power looking to go somewhere, and surely some of it will come to Ergo.


[08/17/2022 5:09 PM] wombo22#5461
What’s your understanding of the eth merge so far, probably best to say that to help others tailor their response to you (if more detail is required)


[08/17/2022 6:05 PM] WiZ_D#9063
Oh ok I understand thank you appreciate it


[08/17/2022 8:47 PM] VillageBC#0000
I'm just experimenting with running a Ergo node off a RPi 4. If I'm not using it for storing Ergo is their any reason to initialize the wallet?


[08/17/2022 8:59 PM] wombo22#5461
If you don’t want to use that wallet then probably not

[08/21/2022 9:51 PM] Crystoll#2311
Hi, checking my old transactions and wallet totals, I noticed a weird thing. Wonder if anyone has a theory/insights on what happened. It happened in May 4th, I had a transaction there that seems to have made some tokens I had disappear. They also don't exist anymore in my wallet totals. Not huge amounts, not a huge loss, but just something I'd like to understand, if there's something I should do about it to avoid in the future.

There was a transaction with 16 outputs going in, but only 14 appearing on right side. One thing I noticed, the tokens that disappeared were listed twice on the left side (outputs), in this case it was 2x2000 NETA, and 2x2000 Mi Goreng. On the right side, they are listed just once, and thus from both of these, 1x2000 tokens just disappeared. 

I heard about some issues with too many tokens in same wallet, so was wondering, is there an issue I should be aware of. This time it was tiny loss, but could have been worse, and I'd like to understand what happened. Any theories?

need to understand why when my ergo node goes from wired to wifi i get a warning and then usually (though not alwys) the node stops synching.
here is the warning:

Hello, how to update an ergo node? Do I have to only replace the .jar file ?

(re @Ahmad123_321 : *Hello, how to update an ergo node? Do I have to only replace the .jar file ?*) 
 
 yes, and when you restart the node - just remember to call the latest version


[08/29/2022 2:14 AM] skinny#2063
Hello,  If I decide to run an ergo node.  Once it's fully synced can I solo mine to it?  Is there a specific port I would need to connect to?

[08/29/2022 1:43 PM] wombo22#5461
anything in particular you would like to be able to do with your wallet or just in general if there are any better wallets


[08/29/2022 1:43 PM] wombo22#5461
there are probably different features each of the wallets may be able to provide, so it maybe worth to look into each to determine which one you find more useful


[08/29/2022 1:48 PM] wombo22#5461
but if you just want a wallet to store and use, then doesn't matter to much which one you use they all equally good

One last thing, im mining to my local node now. Does the ergo node wallet need to remain unlocked to receive rewards? I imagine its not necessary as its stored on the chain.

Hi, I need help with staking center on yoroi.


[08/30/2022 5:16 AM] RobortomP#0000
Nothing appears in the staking center tab, its been like that for few days now, not sure where to find solution


[08/30/2022 11:38 AM] wombo22#5461
correct not necessary! you just input the address that you want everything you mine to go to, all on chain


[08/30/2022 11:42 AM] wombo22#5461
would you mean the delegation list tab? FYI you cant stake ergo so if you have an ergo wallet, it wont appear

[08/30/2022 7:41 PM] wombo22#5461
ahh yes that is correct, you dont have to add any additional addresses for other tokens


[08/30/2022 7:41 PM] wombo22#5461
they should all appear

My ergo node (built by the Satergo wallet app) keeps on crashing every 10 minutes or so, and I am getting this error message in the UI:
[org.ergoplatform.network.ErgoNodeViewSynchronizer$ReceivableMessages$SemanticallySuccessfulModifier] to Actor[akka://ergoref/user/$f#-1865044454] was unhandled.

Any clue?

 In Akka, messages that can't be delivered are routed to a synthetic actor which has the path “/deadLetters”. This is for NON transport lost messages. Akka makes no guarantees for lost messages at the transport layer. Existence of dead letters does not necessarily indicate a problem, but they are logged by default for the sake of caution

So not that helpful of a message, you get it when the node is running fine too. That should just be a WARN, if it's crashing there should be some others and maybe an ERROR

(re @glasgowm : *So not that helpful of a message, you get it when the node is running fine too. That should just be a WARN, if it's crashing there should be some others and maybe an ERROR*) 
 
 So, as the node keeps on synching it keeps on crashing
anyhow - the first error that i am getting is this:
11:34:09.930 ERROR [ctor.default-dispatcher-4] s.c.n.NetworkController - Declared address validation failed:

Starting yesterday, I was no longer able to send ERG using nautilus.  It would say the transaction was successful, but would never show up on Ergo Explorer ("Transaction with this ID was not found, or it has not entered Mempool yet)".   I thought maybe something was down on nautilus, so I installed the Ergo's official mobile wallet and tried to send my ERG with it instead.  However when I send ERG with the official mobile app I get a long error that includes words such as "Could not send transaction" "Error executing AP request" "Error 400" "Reason: Bad Request" "Detail: Malformed transaction"  "has too high cost".   I even tried to send to a different destination address, but still have the same problems with both wallets.  None of these issues started until yesterday. Any ideas???

(re  : *<Ambrosiaman> Hello ergo team,  I have an old phone in wich i use an ergo wallet, a long time ago i removed the screen lock, and also lost the seed code, and every time i try to do a transaction or trying to see my seed code, i get: Key Permanently Invalidated.*) 
 
 Sorry when you remove the auth the saved biometrics don't work any more. So you need to restore from seed which you don't have as well -> funds lost

Hello,
Waves Platform Wallet ( WX Invesr ) have some problems with Ergo Transactions.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/670288337747312646/1016091426460807208/file_54671.jpg


[09/04/2022 10:05 PM] Lazy0tter#0000
At the moment, transactions for depositing and withdrawing Ergo from the platform are limited.

WX Invest support service reported that these are technical problems associated with the work carried by Ergo Platform specialists.  
This is true ?  When can we expect the work to be completed?

screenshot of the correspondence with technical support is attached (in Russian).


[09/05/2022 9:45 AM] glasgowm#9381
Never heard of it but ergo network has no technical issues.

Hi, I restored my Nautlius seed phrase into the iOS Ergo Wallet but my funds aren't showing. What do I need to do to have my funds show in the iOS wallet? I cannot send transactions using Nautilus at the moment as I'm getting an error


[09/06/2022 10:35 AM] glasgowm#0000
What error? Do funds match the explorer? You may need to derive new addresses


[09/06/2022 10:46 AM] jkpw#1293
The error is on Nautlius: "Transaction signing error: Prover error (tx input index 0): Failed on step2(prover does not have enough witnesses to perform the proof)


[09/06/2022 10:47 AM] Tim_08#0000

[09/06/2022 10:57 AM] jkpw#1293
Any idea why my funds wouldn't show up on iOS wallet though? I could do with transferring them from Naultilus -> iOS. I need to get my funds back onto an exchange


[09/06/2022 10:58 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Is the address the same?


[09/06/2022 11:15 AM] jkpw#1293
Yeah but I'm getting a bit confused here. 

I originally had a Yoroi wallet. Yoroi lost support so I moved to Nautilus, I imported my Yoroi seed phrase to Nautilus and since then, I've been buying more Ergo.

I've tried to now restore my Naultilus wallet into the iOS app but it shows I have 0 funds. I've now just tried to restore my Yoroi seed phrase into the iOS app and it shows funds (but only half of what I was expecting, I guess these are the funds that were originally in the Yoroi wallet).

Where's all the rest? 
I don't understand how I have around 400 ERG in my Yoroi wallet when I switched to Naultilus, shouldn't this be now 0 and my Naultilus wallet should be the main wallet now?


[09/06/2022 11:16 AM] jkpw#1293
it could be that I've been generating new addresses when receiving funds in my Naultilus wallet but I thought they would all link to my main xpub address


[09/06/2022 11:16 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Probably funds on more derived addresses. Wallet config -> addresses

ya no worries, sorry wish I can help but havnt tried out the SigRSV contracts much


[09/06/2022 3:14 PM] McCastigatore#5816
I used it to buy sigmaRSV but this is the first time I redeem them for ERGs. I really hope I haven't lost my tokens.


[09/06/2022 3:20 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
(re  : *<McCastigatore> I am so desperate to really hope that they were some kind of support*) 
 
 Sigmausd.io does not tell you that you have to include some ERG for it to work. So usually what people are doing then: send 0.1 more ERG to the address provided and use the refund link to get the Sigrsv back. Then I recommend you to use tokenjay.app for the next try to redeem, compare the user experience of the two dapps and use the one that was better in the future


[09/06/2022 3:20 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Disclaimer: tokenjay.app was made by me


[09/06/2022 3:21 PM] McCastigatore#5816
Okay, I will try. Thank you very much


[09/06/2022 3:24 PM] McCastigatore#5816
Btw, may I send you a little tip in Erg to thank you for the help provided? I am very grateful for the support


[09/06/2022 3:25 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
If you use tokenjay a small fee goes to me. You spend less than on sigmausd and tip me. That's enough 👍


[09/06/2022 3:26 PM] McCastigatore#5816
I will use it, thank you. You really saved me a good amount of money


[09/06/2022 3:26 PM] McCastigatore#5816

[09/06/2022 3:27 PM] Ergo Tipper Bot[BETA]#0902
wombo22, the server returned an error so something went wrong, maybe try again later

I tried tokenjay app and it worked flawlessly, thank you. Sorry if I bother you but I can't get my sigmaRSV from my previous transaction. I sent 0.15 Erg to the address where my sigmaRSV are stuck and I tried the refund process but it didn't work. The app said that there was unable to generate a tx, error 4. What can I do?


[09/06/2022 3:49 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
isn't there another error message? usually it sais "minimal amount of erg not met" or so

Hello! Please tell me, I started a SAFEW wallet, threw 1 Ergo coin from the Kukoin exchange to check it, a week has passed and the coin has not appeared?


[09/08/2022 10:21 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
do you have the transaction id?

the erg is on address 9hYBaBUzLQiQW8fpUMQXhj8my8wLF4JR8vHsC2UkysTf6Ca6VX2 - is this the address SAFEW is showing?

Hello,  Im trying to setup a local ergo node.  It has synced and I started the node.  I can connect to the node but I get zero hashes and debug shows.
debug: [Block notification via RPC polling] undefined
debug: [No new blocks for 60 seconds - updating transactions & rebroadcasting work] undefined


[09/08/2022 8:05 PM] wombo22#5461
if you dont hear anything back here try asking in #node you can enable in #deleted-channel


[09/08/2022 8:23 PM] skinny#2063
Thanks I'll try there.

Can payments go directly to nautilus wallet and not am exchange?


[09/09/2022 12:44 PM] wombo22#5461
yep, you essentially mine to an address


[09/09/2022 12:45 PM] wombo22#5461
nautilus is used to view the address and easily interact with the ecosystem


[09/09/2022 1:36 PM] peachmufffin#8779
I initialized a new wallet on a node.
After mining, there is some amount on it.

I started another node and used the same seed phrase during wallet initialization.
Through this new node, I tried to send a transaction and got an error: There must be at least one input box.
I also noticed that now a different address is used on the new node.

How can I fix this? 
Should I use this method `/wallet/updateChangeAddress` and pass in body the address from the first node?
I tried to do this and I get this error: `"The request content was malformed:\nexpected whitespace or eof got 'address...' (line 1, column 2)"`

Question. On ergo wallet when I try to send ergo to my exchange it tells me I need to enter a password. Where is this password as I did not set one up?

Hey There 
Quick question for a noob
I have two wallets in my ergo mobile wallet app
I tried to restore them on a new device but only one appears the over is missing
Did i do something wrong ?


[09/11/2022 10:00 AM] DeadMan#9961

each wallet has its independent seed phrase


[09/11/2022 11:20 AM] Badsanta44#2705
Aaaand i'm f*cked 😅


[09/11/2022 11:21 AM] blackinsecure#3693
you can still get the seed phrase using the ergo mobile wallet


[09/11/2022 11:25 AM] Badsanta44#2705
No because i absolutely dont remember the password 
Its not a big bag i will survive
Thanks for your answrs 👍🏻🤝🏻


[09/11/2022 12:02 PM] repoman1#7239
this is weird

You can rescan blocks in swagger? But explorer is accurate, if it's not displaying balance then something wrong locally representing it

[09/13/2022 3:10 PM] glasgowm#9381
Use the refund option in the menu, if you're getting minimal ERG value not met you need to send the proxy (long address) 0.01 erg and then refund

[09/15/2022 1:08 AM] Setvin#2532

[09/15/2022 1:08 AM] Setvin#2532
the new version of the ergo node has nemonic passphrase which I had enabled


[09/15/2022 1:09 AM] Setvin#2532
I thought the password I had was just node unlock password, which was something I didnt have


[09/15/2022 1:09 AM] Setvin#2532
so I just restarted with the numonic and made a new node pass


[09/15/2022 1:09 AM] Setvin#2532
long story short I figured it out and confused myself because I remeber the node not having pnumatic password

Best just using one of the more popular wallets. Can run a node too if you like, but the node wallet isn't very user-friendly and more for dev use. 

But you don't mine to the node unless you're solo mining

How do we propose to fix this difficulty, its way to long and we are about to see a 2 day cycle of  "Ergo Difficulty way to high" that causes everyone to jump off ( like it currently is we are at 146T/H), then 2 days later because everyone jumped off the Difficulty will become extremly low causing everyone to jump back on causing this massive influx of people again, then we are going to be in this massive cycle?

but it includes the sigma SC and some exchanges afaik


[09/17/2022 8:46 PM] elazor#0115
Difficulty adjust as miners jump off, it’s a lagging difficulty adjustment. However the only real way to make it profitable is for the value of the coin to go up. With the current macro environment it will be tough in the short term but should be fine over the next few months.

How to you change the wallet associated with the node?


[09/17/2022 10:46 PM] glasgowm#0000
(re  : *<mtthom06> How to you change the wallet associated with the node?*) 
 
 Delete the .ergo/wallet folder


[09/17/2022 11:02 PM] mtthom06#8195
OK. Thanks

making transactions with nautilus


[09/18/2022 5:54 AM] blackinsecure#3693
profitability is one problem, but coin hopping is another and price alone doesn't fix that


[09/18/2022 6:41 AM] elazor#0115
Could be a problem but I don’t expect it to be a major one if ergo is the most profitable coin to mine. Time will tell.


[09/18/2022 6:08 PM] TheJetmaster#8904
Hey hey. I have a problem it seems. I made two smaller transactions today from KuCoin to my Yoroi Ergo wallet. The transactions never arrived, despite the "completed" status in the KuCoin account. I have never had that issue before either. Is there some current issue either with the chain or with Yoroi that anyone is aware of? Thx for any helping comments in advance! Cheers


[09/18/2022 6:14 PM] TheJetmaster#8904
Is there sth like pool.pm for Ergo.... where I can look into the holdings without checking thru the Yoroi wallet?

 Can you please check it on the Explorer?


[09/18/2022 6:16 PM] TheJetmaster#8904
I did. the first tx has 4900 confirmations, the second one only 88... Bit strange given that I made them around 5h ago


[09/18/2022 6:18 PM] TheJetmaster#8904
No I am lying... sorry. The thing just solved itself. I made only 1 tx and that has only 90 confirmations now.


[09/18/2022 6:18 PM] TheJetmaster#8904
I assume that means the tx is still in transit? Why is the chain so slow today? Any public reason?


[09/18/2022 6:52 PM] Steel#8070
Blocks are slow today, but funds should show up after only 1 confirmation.


[09/18/2022 6:58 PM] TheJetmaster#8904
Hmmm still not showing in Yoroi. In the explorer though I see the final balance. Weird


[09/18/2022 7:03 PM] Steel#8070
That's good to hear, your funds arrived and you shouldn't worry. I would recommend switching wallets though, Ergo users have been plagued with Yoroi syncing issues. You can restore your seed on any of the other wallets. I'd recommend Nautilus for browser, and Ergo Mobile for Android/ios

Your kucoin dashboard should tell you it’s status and how many more confirmations it needs.

[09/18/2022 9:48 PM] cannon#3541
Price increasing does nothing to this rediculous lag.... same wave in and out... you're suggesting the low tide will be more profitable as the price will help, but why not even the seas and make the low and high tide in more of equilibrium.


[09/18/2022 9:56 PM] elazor#0115
Only thing I’m suggesting is lower difficulty makes it easier  to mine blocks, which may mean more profits for a miner. I’d be happy seeing it like eth, currently I don’t see that big of an issue with the current set up. 

As I see it people are free to jump in with all their hash and mine unprofitably on any coin at this point. Everything is unprofitable. If ergo ends up being like eth (the most profitable coin) there is no real incentive to jump in and out of it. The only scenario I see where this can pose a problem is if there are 2 profitable coins (including ergo) that are essentially equally profitable. But at this point in time that’s not the case. Feel free to email the ergo foundation with the concerns or put it on Reddit where it can be discussed more thoroughly.


[09/18/2022 10:08 PM] cannon#3541
Thanks. Closed thinking is why the mining reward was slashed and difficulty was not addressed.
 Everytime mentioned since eip adjustment it has been pooh-pooh, tut-tut let me explain why you're wrong and a greedy noob miner. 
I hope, truly, the chain and project is successful. I've engaged more thoroughly with this than any project.
But, this difficulty blunder is only acceptable because there are 100TH of morons that are buying coin (via mining) at higher price than available on exchange ... around $11/erg is mining investment.

Is Ergo broken? I'm not receiving any payouts and I also can't sent any crypto. I've tested with two wallets (restores) and when I check explorer I get this error "Transaction with this ID was not found, or it has not entered Mempool yet".


[09/19/2022 10:02 AM] Sinauth#0001
Additionally, I have a payout of 4000 ERG from solo 2miners and it's been stuck "unconfirmed" for over 9 hours now.

No payouts from Nanopool (stuck days ago) No payouts from 2miners and I can't send or receive any ERG. I've tested with Yoroi and Nautilus wallets.


[09/19/2022 10:06 AM] glasgowm#9381
and what happens with Nautilus when you try and send?


[09/19/2022 10:07 AM] Sinauth#0001
Well, things seem to be okay. I enter my spending password and it seems successful. When I check every transaction, it just says  "Transaction with this ID was not found, or it has not entered Mempool yet" on blockchain explorer.


[09/19/2022 10:07 AM] glasgowm#9381
and when you go to your address on explorer?


[09/19/2022 10:07 AM] Sinauth#0001
But, this isn't just my wallets. As I said, no payouts from Nanopool (like 2-3 days ago) and 2miners I found blocks during this night but stuck on "Unconfirmed" for 9 hours.

Should be fine with nautilus

Okay, well I dunno what else to say. I can not send or receive anything with nautilus and not receiving from pools.


[09/19/2022 10:10 AM] glasgowm#9381
Maybe something local preventing it being submitted? You'd need to ask nano/2miners but nothing is stuck in mempool for more than a couple mins atm so nothing submitted to the network


[09/19/2022 10:10 AM] Sinauth#0001

why, when I check blockchain explorer, do I not see payouts from pools

There are many issues going on with ERG blockchain right now. Please can someone investigate?


[09/19/2022 10:15 AM] glasgowm#9381
Blocks are a bit slow atm due to difficulty adjustment which means the oracle is slow, but no ongoing issues outwith that afaik; my test payment just confirmed fine. DM me the address you're trying to send from - sure you've not clicked the wrong one?

Hi Ergo fam.
I was wondering about the difference it exists between ErgoScript & Haskell (Plutus platform).
I know the latter is a functional programming language. I had the opportunity to use Lisp back in the time in college and I wasn't able to appreciate what a functional language can bring, it's now done thanks to Cardano. But what about ErgoScript ? Is it more enjoyable to use it for programmers? 
Please someone enlight me here.
Thanks 🙏

 How many confirmations? It needs 60, if it’s above that you should open a ticket with kucoin

then generate another address and transfer to that


[09/20/2022 1:21 PM] Martin#0000
Should I put my Yoroi recovery phrase to Nautilus?


[09/20/2022 1:22 PM] Martin#0000
Will it work like that?


[09/20/2022 1:22 PM] blackinsecure#3693
Yes


[09/20/2022 1:22 PM] blackinsecure#3693
But indeed transfer the funds to a new address, because if you put your seed phrase in that scam website then that address is compromised


[09/20/2022 1:23 PM] Martin#0000
I tried to transfer it to my KuCoin back where I bought it but it stays on Submitted


[09/20/2022 1:23 PM] glasgowm#0000
Yes sir but if you check explorer I imagine there’s no funds to send and yoroi is just displaying old data


[09/20/2022 1:24 PM] blackinsecure#3693
recover your wallet on Nautilus and see if the funds are even still there


[09/20/2022 1:24 PM] blackinsecure#3693
Yoroi probably not even syncing the new data


[09/20/2022 1:25 PM] Martin#0000
I restored the Yoroi wallett in microsoft edge browser


[09/20/2022 1:25 PM] Martin#0000

stop using yoroi

[09/20/2022 1:27 PM] blackinsecure#3693
IF nautilus shows your funds are still there, you transfer. If not, you were successfully scammed

I thought through the transparency it is easier to follow the crypto transactions

is there any solution?

hm ok.


[09/20/2022 2:00 PM] wombo22#5461
you can follow transactions easier but first off you would have to figure out who's address it is then the person would have to send you the funds and sign the transaction themselves which they probably wont


[09/20/2022 2:01 PM] Martin#0000

Likely the best you can get out of this is a learning lesson. Hopefully you can even help others avoid such situations.


[09/20/2022 2:07 PM] Martin#0000
this all happened because of Binance not handling ERG


[09/20/2022 2:07 PM] Martin#0000

[09/20/2022 2:12 PM] blackinsecure#3693
you entered your seed phrase in an scam website. How is that related to Binance?


[09/20/2022 4:06 PM] Julizzle#5827
Sad to hear that buddy. Crypto is still like the wild west. You have to be aware of extremely creative scammer tactics these days. Especially when you are playing with defi you have to question everything. Hell even me haha. People in discord groups, people sending you dms acting like customer support. It’s still early days. So learn from it and don’t make the same mistake twice

```Could not generate tx, {"error":400,"reason":"bad.request","detail":"Bad request List(PaymentRequest(9ghpH3ndtbjhfhS296NHrpJh1jY86QfFAopuTaBz6QvP9APKJ8w,-200000,List(([B@cc32939,100000)),Map()), PaymentRequest(2iHkR7CWvD1R4j1yZg5bkeDRQavjAaVPeTDFGGLZduHyfWMuYpmhHocX8GJoaieTx78FntzJbCBVL6rf96ocJoZdmWBL2fci7NqWgAirppPQmZ7fN9V6z13Ay6brPriBKYqLp1bT2Fk4FkFLCfdPpe,1200000,List(),Map())). requirement failed: Minimal ERG value not met"}

Hi, I am starting up a node, and need to change the wallet that I had initialized in the node.  How can I reset it to a different wallet?

Hey I got it back yay! That's an interesting way to do things, an How-to write is definitely needed on the SigmaUSD site so it doesn't become so bothersome. Next time I will try tokenjay.app

Yoroi wallet has known issues and isnt recomended. Their node may not be synced or some other issue, could just be slower than normal block times though   .yoroi


[09/23/2022 6:11 PM] TerryMoore88#1966
He has the seed phrase could he just use that to make a new wallet on Ergo mobile @carllittle1?


[09/23/2022 6:11 PM] carllittle1#3740
they sure can and would be advised to do so


[09/23/2022 6:14 PM] blackinsecure#3693
yes


[09/23/2022 6:15 PM] carllittle1#3740
I used my seed phrase for Nautilus wallet on my pc and for the Ergo mobile on my phone, both work well but i do prefer the mobile wallet

Idk if anyone could help me I want to learn how to code on ergo, but I’m never actually coded in my life where should I start like should I learn stuff like Java script first idk


[09/26/2022 12:29 AM] Purple Octopus#4028
Ergo uses Scala which is quite different syntax from Javascript though the logic of programming is the same in all languages

Here is the Ergo DeCo layman course getting you started in ErgoScript (where smart contract scripts are written)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAWeW6wajEw&list=PLopsKGshj0B6C1mg6RpDsj0rhYxam3_RZ

As for learning Scala, I don't have anything I can share with you as I haven't learned it either

So would jumping straight into scala be hard or is there a more beginner Friendly language I should I learn first


[09/26/2022 1:38 AM] Purple Octopus#4028
idk maybe watch some of the DeCo videos to get a more general overview of developing smart contracts on Ergo ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[09/26/2022 1:41 AM] Purple Octopus#4028
ErgoScript is supposed to pretty simplified for development but like anything else, it will take time to learn especially if you're new to coding.

Python is much easier to learn for most new coders and getting a handle on programming logic but you'll learn much more faster if you are motivated to build some kind of project.


[09/26/2022 2:11 AM] damonboss#1115

Took the easy method and installed the windows version of Satergo.. Running a full node with that


[10/01/2022 12:05 AM] ElMoren0#7288
I'm trying to run the node as a service on Ubuntu 20.04 based on the FAQ in the docs page but I'm getting the following error: 
● node.service - ErgoNode Service
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/node.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

My /ergo/run_node.sh:
#!/bin/sh
java -jar -Xmx4G ergo-*.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf

Java is in the path and the node runs fine if I just run it manually. Any ideas of what' I'm doing wrong?


[10/01/2022 12:09 AM] glasgowm#0000
permissions at a guess? `chmod +x run_node.sh`, or you can see more a error output with `journalctl -x` or `systemctl status node.service`

[10/01/2022 1:17 AM] ElMoren0#7288
Thanks! I should have checked the journalctl. It turned out that even though java was in the path it needed the absolute path. Also, IDK why but sdkman installed java in my user folder and not /usr/bin. I ended up putting the full java path in the run_node.sh and it works.

app just get stuck in loading after send


[10/01/2022 9:30 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Which version do you use?


[10/01/2022 9:35 AM] blackinsecure#3693
downloaded the latest one just for this


[10/01/2022 9:39 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
So when it looks stuck, chances are that you have many small boxes and explorer/node you are connecting to respond slowly. The latest version restrict to 100 boxes but it still need some time, but surely not forever.
Do you try to send from a read only wallet or set up with mnemonic?


[10/01/2022 12:09 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Did you succeed now?


[10/01/2022 12:11 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Thought about it some more. Chances are that you really have a lot of boxes on the address and the token is on a box coming at the end. Now the restriction to 100 boxes will not apply, because the boxes arent added because they don't contain the token. It will end up in a long wait time.
Recommend box consolidation, try to send all your coins to yourself and see what the app tells you!


[10/01/2022 2:20 PM] blackinsecure#3693
tried desktop and mobile both recovering, not read only


[10/01/2022 3:01 PM] blackinsecure#3693
I'm afraid of sending stuff to myself tbh because I have too many hahahah


[10/01/2022 3:37 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Can you dm me your p2pk address?


[10/01/2022 3:46 PM] blackinsecure#3693
did it on discord


[10/01/2022 4:37 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
ok, I've checked the address. it has more than 1300 unspent boxes, would recommend to keep it at 100 max. So what you should do is really sending to yourself. Use a tx fee of 0.002 as otherwise the tx will most likely not succeed at the moment.
There's nothing that can go wrong with sending to yourself. Do it as long as the wallet states that you have to many boxes to send.


[10/01/2022 4:38 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
what will help a bit is to use a node that has a very low response time for you. check with the wand in the settings

 Large transaction with the lowest fee (0.001). You probably have to wait until after the hardfork.
Miners pick the transactions based on fee per byte (highest to lowest)


[10/02/2022 4:06 PM] bobovich#2179
and when is the end of the hard fork?


[10/02/2022 4:10 PM] bobovich#2179

in approx 16 hours from now. depends on the miners

if more join its going to *happen earlier, if more leave its going to take longer


[10/02/2022 4:18 PM] essaias#5787
your transaction may be executed earlier. depends on mem pool backlog. currently you just can wait

Probably will work if you explicitly select a box that is known to be unspent on the explorer and spend with higher fee. If you are allowing node to do its own selection then it may be selecting invalid input boxes. Otherwise, removing wallet folder will probably also fix

 Hello, good time, I can't find my wallet recovery words in the wallet and I don't have access to them.  And if I delete the wallet I will lose all my property please guide me how to access the recovery words.

there is no way to do so in yoroi

you can only send to another, new wallet

 Do not worry. You should make another wallet (Satergo on PC or Android wallet on the smartphone for example ) and simply send all your funds to new one as far as you still have access to old one. The seed phrase from new wallet should be kept in safe place then.

Hi All! Who has experience here with Explorer?  i'm new to scala/sbt so not really sure how to resolve this. I checked out the latest release tag from the explorer-backend repo, and I go under the chain-grabber module, for example, i'm using the Dockerfile for the build, and i'm getting this:

[10/22/2022 12:41 AM] glasgowm#9381
explorer images need to be built I believe, they're not published. 

Some more resources here; 
https://docs.ergoplatform.com/dev/stack/explorer/explorer_local/

and added you to relevant roles here on discord so you can see related channels.


[10/22/2022 12:45 AM] Reqlez#6611
thanks!  ( yes i'm building them, getting the error while building )  I will take a look tho, ty.  But from my initial research, it seems it's not finding the proper project id from the build.sbt file or something.


[10/22/2022 12:48 AM] Reqlez#6611
Okay great, there are some instructions there, i will test them out.


[10/22/2022 12:48 AM] glasgowm#9381
Usually means you're not in the right directory / same one as the build, but sbt can change your current dir so its confusing


[10/22/2022 12:48 AM] glasgowm#9381
getblok guys/ ilya will know better if the docs no use

If you want to fire up the chain-grabber module you go into the top level folder (not the actual module directory) and run: sbt chain-grabber/run


[10/22/2022 12:56 AM] Reqlez#6611
yea but i'm trying to build from Dockerfile. However, maybe the same thing applies here as well. I will just follow the instructions 😅


[10/22/2022 12:57 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
Ahh sorry missed the docker part. Sounds good come back if it doesn’t work 🙂


[10/22/2022 12:58 AM] Reqlez#6611
Okay, at the very bottom of page... "docker build explorer-backend/modules/chain-grabber/"


[10/22/2022 12:58 AM] Reqlez#6611
so you have to actually do it outside the folder :partyblobcatparrot:


[10/22/2022 1:00 AM] Reqlez#6611
nvm, same thing... i'm sure i will figure it out 😅


[10/22/2022 1:04 AM] curbsideprophet#5083

@MrStahlfelge So I tried out the box consolidation dApp as well and and when I go back to trying to exchange for Sigma tokens I get the message:

~~The box consolidation transaction was cancelled if that means anything~~

Nevermind it just now popped up as executed and the box consolidation worked

It can’t sync nodes, because can’t connect ipv4 address

@Satergo


[11/14/2022 12:08 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @AGeO : *It can’t sync nodes, because can’t connect ipv4 address*) 
 
 Well, there is no public reachable IPv6 node at the moment. If you can't somehow connect through IPv4, you can't host a node. There needs to be at least 1 node that is open through IPv6 for you to access the network


[11/14/2022 12:12 PM] Satergo#0000
The node didn't even support IPv6 until a few months ago when I submitted a fix, so that might be one reason there is no public IPv6.


[11/14/2022 12:17 PM] K#0000
Ipv6 is future, we need more ipv6 nodes


[11/14/2022 12:18 PM] Satergo#0000
Sure, start one if you can


[11/14/2022 12:19 PM] AGeO#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *The node didn't even support IPv6 until a few months ago when I submitted a fix, so that might be one reason there is no public IPv6.*) 
 
 Thanks your answer. Looking forward to more such nodes.


[11/14/2022 4:22 PM] glasgowm#0000
(re @AGeO : *Thanks your answer. Looking forward to more such nodes.*) 
 
 There’s one displaying on ergonodes as reachable - so should work? I’ve switched mine over to IPv6 too


[11/14/2022 4:29 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @AGeO : *Thanks your answer. Looking forward to more such nodes.*) 
 
 Scotman started an IPv6 node but you will need to add it manually


[11/14/2022 4:30 PM] glasgowm#0000
Shouldn’t it be able to pick up this one?

No


[11/14/2022 4:30 PM] Satergo#0000
The way nodes are discovered is that there's a few hardcoded known peers in the node which are connected to and then you request more node IPs from them


[11/14/2022 4:31 PM] Satergo#0000
All hardcoded known peers are IPv4 so it will not work for him, but he can add scot's node to the list of known peers


[11/14/2022 4:33 PM] Satergo#0000
Add to your conf file at the bottom:

`scorex.network.knownPeers = ["[2601:204:c003:57e3:95b6:6344:5577:3e9c]:9030"]`


[11/14/2022 4:37 PM] Satergo#0000
Also, this doesn't necessarily mean that your node will only be connected to this one. Since your network doesn't support IPv4 you won't be able to connect to others, but if you make your node reachable then other nodes that have networks that support IPv6 connections as well will connect to you.

(re @mewtoshi : *The way nodes are discovered is that there's a few hardcoded known peers in the node which are connected to and then you request more node IPs from them*) 
 
 I see, thanks for the info. Maybe we need to hardcore some ipv6 ones, is there a reason it can’t (or doesn’t) broadcast on both ipv4/6 if avail?

(re @glasgowm : *I see, thanks for the info. Maybe we need to hardcore some ipv6 ones, is there a reason it can’t (or doesn’t) broadcast on both ipv4/6 if avail?*)

If you press the magic wand next to the node url field in the Ergo wallet app it will search the fastest node for you. Prefer HTTPS nodes. 

Of course, you can also enter your node there as long as it's public.

Hey! I asked the ADAX exchange Reddit about the possibility of getting Ergo listed on their centralized exchange. It is primarily focused on Cardano, but I thought it would be a good fit for ergo. Their head of business development said it would be able to be done, but that someone from ergo needs to apply. I am reaching out here hoping I can notify the right person to get the ball rolling so we can finally get an exchange that can easily transfer between ergo and Cardano. Is there someone here that can help get this message to the right place

Sorry for raising this issue again, but my friend have similar situation as this one. 
He mined ERGO for some time and stored it on iPhone wallet, which is "expired".
He installed new version (just like you did) , but it doesn't restore his original address with coins. Instead, it is some other totally random address with balance 0. Of course I asked him if seed is correct and he confirmed that's only seed he have for ERGO. We even tried to install Android version on my phone and restore wallet using seed and again got address with balance 0... 😔 
Can you please tell me how did you solve this problem? (if you did)
Or someone else can help with this?
Thanks in advance!

 Click into the wallet and generate more derived addresses.

Derivation is now fixed. If it is an address which has different address fix/non fix there is hint when restoring. So not likely that issus

 Was there a warning when restoring about an invalid mnemonic? Or a button "this is not my address" on Last screen?


[11/28/2022 10:39 PM] Texonja#3403
No, everything was smooth during restoring.


[11/28/2022 10:41 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Then my bet is on that it's not the right mnemonic


[11/28/2022 11:00 PM] Texonja#3403
He is sure that's only mnemonic he ever had and only address he ever had on his phone.


[11/28/2022 11:00 PM] Texonja#3403

[11/28/2022 11:00 PM] glasgowm#9381

Nope, screenshot.


[11/28/2022 11:04 PM] glasgowm#9381
Sounds like either a) he's wrong and it's the wrong mnemonic / he made more than one b) it's an old wallet and he made lots of addressees for some reason and his erg will be 100+ derived addresses in


[11/28/2022 11:11 PM] Texonja#3403
I can't say anything 100% since this isn't about me. 
Long story short - he has "expired" wallet on his iOS and 800+ ERG stuck on his address (which he cannot access with this seed he has). Is there some advice what can he do? Or just to forget about those coins?


[11/28/2022 11:17 PM] glasgowm#0000
Well the first thing would be b) generate more addresses. If it doesn't show maybe try another wallet just in case. Failing that try and find the correct mnemonic.


[11/28/2022 11:19 PM] Texonja#3403
Tried iOS wallet, Android and Desktop, with same result.
Tried creating 260 new addresses.... We can try more but...... 😔


[11/28/2022 11:25 PM] wombo22#5461
nvm seeming more than likely mnemonic wrong

 You have too many small boxes. Go to dapps -> box consolidation to consolidate


[11/29/2022 7:14 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
It's no problem of the network but on your address

(re @MrStahlfelge : *You have too many small boxes. Go to dapps -> box consolidation to consolidate*) 
 
 miner pay ant was 0.1 and many transactions happened.. I made bigger.. so problem will be  resolved automatically?


[11/29/2022 7:20 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Problem won't be as pressing in the future when your payout is bigger now. But you either need to spent the 100 0.1 erg boxes or consolidate them, they are blocking and won't go away

[12/01/2022 5:04 PM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
Hi guys.  I need some help calculating Time To Find a block.    For something like bitcoin it's
```
TTF = (Network difficulty  * nonce space [ which is 2^32]) / pool  hashrate
TTF = network difficulty * 0x100000000/ pool hashrate
```

i'm trying to find what the Nonce space is for ergo, and i can't seem to find it in the white papers and my google magic isn't working today.  Does anyone know?

By my rudimentary calculations  it's around 2^20 or 0x100000

Can someone please set me straight?
Thanks,

Hello, I purchased ERG last year in July/August time and I stored my tokens off of the exchange in a Yoroi wallet.  Today I went to go withdraw tokens from my wallet and I couldn't remember the spending password.  I also can't find my seed phrase.  Am I shit out of luck?

 Unfortunately yes, sorry


[12/01/2022 7:34 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
Best bet is to just try and guess the spending password as nothing else you can do without the seed phrase

Haven't used that wallet in past... can you get into the wallet via browser? Then it should be guessing your spending password.

Hello guys! I just sent Erg to my private wallet from Kucoin (like the 50th time I did that). Everything seemed okay and the sent ERG amount was showing in my mobile wallet as unconfirmed (as usual for a few minutes). But it never changed to confirmed. It says cancelled. What can I do now? The ERG are  not in my wallet and not on my KuCoin account. Thanks for any help!

Have a block reward question. I had an old node (4.x) that had a wallet and I had a private mining stratum pool pointing at it. I upgraded it a couple days ago to 5.0.3 and I appear to have a popped a block last night. What is weird is the reward address in my mining config is set to my old address; but the block appears to have gone to a different address; and I have a new xxxx.json file in my keystore directory... any ideas?

Ergo Node Wallet Balance Not the Same as Explorer [Support]
Having issues with my node wallet I think. I have a local node and a stratum server. Set up to mine to it. Looks like I hit a block showing a mining reward but my mobile wallet that should be the same address shows 0 and so does explorer. If I try to transfer funds I get the following error. 
[image] 
Not sure whats going on. I tried a wallet rescan. Funds showed up again but still not on anything...


[12/21/2022 10:01 PM] matty_19#4994
Hey thats me lol. If anyone can provide some direction that would be awesome. I had a look at Ergo Doc Solo Mining page and I'm still not sure whats happening. Block reward looks like it's paid to my reward address. Shows up as a balance on my node wallet, but not on Explorer or my mobile app that should be linked. Confirmations on the transaction look like they are at 1160 but still doesn't seem accessible. Maybe i have something configured incorrectly. Scanned unspent boxes and it shows al the confirmations but spending transaction null. Wallet was made in the Ergo Node Interface.

[12/21/2022 10:19 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Actually, looking back at the conversation, kushti asked you to confirm: "Where it shows 0.02?" And looking at the image, I have the same question. The only thing the image shows is a wallet balance of 45.033087. Hard to understand what you are talking about.


[12/21/2022 10:20 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Normally, if you have thousands of unspent boxes, it helps to consolidate them.


[12/21/2022 10:20 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
Sorry I didn't see his question. The wallet shows the balance but when you go to available balance it only shows.02


[12/21/2022 10:20 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Because of data limits you can only make transactions of a certain size to consolidate them.


[12/21/2022 10:21 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
Only one unspent box . The block in question has thousands of confirmations


[12/21/2022 10:22 PM] matty_19#4994
I'm in about the same boat. Ergo node interface shows 57, ergo explorer shows 0 on my wallet. Scanning unspent boxes shows over 1100 confirmations


[12/21/2022 10:22 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
@cafebedouin and if you go to the wallet on the explorer it only shows a balance of .02


[12/21/2022 10:24 PM] cafebedouin#9837
So, the issue is there is a discrepancy between your node wallet and explorer, and it's not a problem of confirmations.


[12/21/2022 10:24 PM] matty_19#4994
i also can't transfer to anywhere from the node wallet


[12/21/2022 10:24 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Have you checked another explorer instance?


[12/21/2022 10:25 PM] kushti#0000
(re  : *<matty_19> I'm in about the same boat. Ergo node interface shows 57, ergo explorer shows 0 on my wallet. Scanning unspent boxes shows over 1100 confirmations*) 
 
 Because mining rewards belong to time-and-pubkey lock script, not your "normal" p2pk address. Just send all the funds to yourself in the node wallet, and Explorer will show them after transfer being confirmed on chain


[12/21/2022 10:25 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Well, if you have lots of boxes, you probably need to consolidate them.


[12/21/2022 10:26 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Or, kushti's explanation, which is better.


[12/21/2022 10:27 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Think kushti's answer above also applies in your case.

[12/21/2022 10:30 PM] matty_19#4994
Which address am i using to do that? I tried the wallet address from the Ergo Node Interface page already? or am I supposed to use a different one?


[12/21/2022 10:31 PM] kushti#0000
Send to this address


[12/21/2022 10:32 PM] kushti#0000
If you want to just confirm your rewards with the Explorer you can also get mining rewards address via swagger api ui


[12/21/2022 10:34 PM] matty_19#4994
Yeah i have the mining rewards address and that shows the balance and transaction on Explorer. When i try to send my ergo from Node Interface it gives me an error so i can't do anything with it currently


[12/21/2022 10:35 PM] matty_19#4994
hmm won't let me paste a pic of the error on here lol

[12/21/2022 10:44 PM] matty_19#4994
if there's unnecessary parts its because it was cobbled together to get it to work lol

[12/21/2022 10:52 PM] matty_19#4994
Doesn't seem surprising lol. Not sure what i'm doing half the time but it all connected and ran, and managed to mine a block so i was hopeful.


[12/21/2022 11:14 PM] matty_19#4994
what should it look like to fix it?


[12/21/2022 11:19 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
@kushti#0000 so use the command line for the node wallet and send the funds to another wallet? I tried doing that via the node wallet through the panel but that doesn't work.


[12/21/2022 11:21 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I think you can just send it to the same wallet. It's just a different kind of box, one that doesn't show in explorer I presume.


[12/21/2022 11:25 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
@cafebedouin looks like that worked. I am guessing I will have to wait 720 confirmations?


[12/21/2022 11:26 PM] matty_19#4994
Did you just use the normal wallet address on the Ergo Interface?


[12/21/2022 11:28 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
@matty_19 I used the wallet that was setup with the pool. That is where the balance was and I sent it to that address and it sent

Yeah i still get errors when i try to send it still. Hmm


[12/21/2022 11:34 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
I had to send less than Max. So I lowered it to 45 even though it said I had 45.367


[12/21/2022 11:39 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I'd guess that only applies to the box subject to the time-and-pubkey script. New box shouldn't have that constraint.


[12/21/2022 11:40 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Does max include the mining fee?


[12/21/2022 11:41 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I don't use a node wallet, so just trying to provide general help here.


[12/21/2022 11:43 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Try here and enter in your address manually into the Consolidate boxes option. https://tokenjay.app/app/


[12/21/2022 11:43 PM] cafebedouin#9837
This will tell you how many boxes you have.


[12/21/2022 11:43 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
The Max does include the mining fee I believe. I'm just happy it sent

{Reactions}
👍 

[12/21/2022 11:44 PM] cafebedouin#9837
If there are many, you might have to get smaller amounts to get the transaction size small enough.


[12/21/2022 11:48 PM] matty_19#4994
Ok I'll try when I get back home.


[12/22/2022 12:35 AM] matty_19#4994
well thats fun neither worked. Same error no matter the amount and tokenjay says no unspent boxes


[12/22/2022 12:38 AM] matty_19#4994
but the reward address shows 2 unspent boxes


[12/22/2022 12:50 AM] cafebedouin#9837
So, reviewing. It looks like you are looking to claim a mining reward box. This is why it doesn't show on tokenjay. For some reason, I thought you were dealing with many boxes. So, first issue is there is a delay before you can claim a mining reward box. If that time gas passed, you can restore your node seed in something like Nautilus, send all assets to your main address, and it should work.


[12/22/2022 12:52 AM] matty_19#4994
Yeah its up to like 1200 confirmations


[12/22/2022 12:56 AM] cafebedouin#9837
So, passed time. Then, it should just be a matter of claiming and sending to your address.


[12/22/2022 12:59 AM] matty_19#4994
so i would recover the same wallet just on nautilus instead?


[12/22/2022 1:02 AM] matty_19#4994
I recovered it on Nautilus and same thing. Shows nothing


[12/22/2022 2:05 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Yeah, now, on assets, scroll to bottom select all assets, and then send to your main address for that wallet.


[12/22/2022 2:05 AM] cafebedouin#9837
I think that's how you claim it, at least what I gather from above.


[12/22/2022 2:48 AM] matty_19#4994
yeah it shows nothing for assets on nautilus as well.


[12/22/2022 3:12 AM] HastyBear#6742
in your config  there is extra test  = "ergo {" which is breaking json format.

[12/22/2022 3:35 AM] matty_19#4994
ooooo that wouldn't let me send the full amount but i lowered it to 40 ergo and it seems to have worked. Just sent it to myself and now the transaction is showing. That must be the correct format i guess.


[12/22/2022 3:40 AM] matty_19#4994
I hope I'm not jumping the gun but funds seem to be showing up correctly and accessible.

What difficulty do I have to put currently in the start.js file on ergo on personal node?
I would like to set a minimum share difficulty of 18/19 GB but I don't remember how to do it.

Thats what mine was set do from default. Miners are targeting port 3032 so should be on variable if im not mistaken. Seems to be working, but i couldn't tell you how well just got it online this week and managed to hit a block though.


[12/22/2022 6:52 PM] claudiodelf#7503
Is this setting good for the current difficulty and shares starting from 19 gb +-?


[12/22/2022 6:53 PM] claudiodelf#7503
the slightest difficulty at 8 does not convince me


[12/22/2022 7:16 PM] matty_19#4994
Couldn't tell you but it worked and i mined a block. As i understand it its variable based on the hash rate so it won't sit that low. Somebody more well versed will have to fill you in further.

[12/27/2022 4:36 PM] glasgowm#9381
It was burning native assets, not sure if that's been fixed but not recommended for that reason.

So if you sent SigUSD to it or any native token - it was burnt.

sorry  for ignorance if my question is very basic but i want to learn the best way to mine Ergo

Crypto Mythbusters: Solo Mining Pools Are Useless
When cryptocurrencies came along, everyone mined independently, otherwise known as solo mining. As competition increased, rig owners needed to team up; this is how mining pools emerged. IN THE BEGINNING, THERE WAS SOLO, AND SOLO WAS GOD. Every miner used to have his node. But with the advent of...

[01/03/2023 11:12 PM] wombo22#5461
but i guess thats the writers opinion


[01/04/2023 10:57 AM] glasgowm#9381
probably slightly higher with a pool since they will have configured everything correctly and may have efficiency improvements.


[01/04/2023 12:24 PM] R 3 B 🚬 .#9458
well, if we say so in the pool is better , what is the consideration of  Latency , as in the node the latency almost zero , but in pool latency is higher ! , well , if said also latency is not important , then why there is node developed ?


[01/04/2023 12:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
node is the reference client and how devs (and pools) interact with the chain.


[01/04/2023 7:17 PM] Ergo_Boy#0000
@glasgowm Have a look, maybe found a node client bug. I’m running 5.0.4, and Aberg and I found this oddity while testing Satergo. I restored a wallet in node and found the balance doesn’t show. The address is same. And when you click the link to explorer the balance is correct….here’s the screenshot.

(re @kushti_ru : *Is wallet synced?*) 
 
 Yes fully synced 100%


[01/04/2023 8:10 PM] Ergo_Boy#0000
I can provide seed phrase for someone else to confirm.


[01/04/2023 8:11 PM] Ergo_Boy#0000
Will pm you seed phrase kushti


[01/04/2023 8:12 PM] glasgowm#0000
Try sending to yourself to see if it registers it in the new block. Also an API endpoint in swagger to rescan blocks.


[01/04/2023 8:13 PM] Ergo_Boy#0000
Ok will try


[01/04/2023 8:40 PM] Ergo_Boy#0000
I did the wallet rescan. Didn’t fix it. I sent the balance to myself in Nautilus. Didn’t fix it.


[01/04/2023 8:41 PM] Ergo_Boy#0000
I sent seed to Kushti if he wants to try to reproduce.


[01/04/2023 8:41 PM] glasgowm#0000
Are you on the right block? Match explorer? Sometimes can freeze and display as synced when it isn't


[01/04/2023 8:44 PM] Ergo_Boy#0000
Yup latest block 911195. I’m leaving the issue alone now. If it’s a real bug, you guys will determine it. It’s prob just me doing something stupid.


[01/05/2023 11:15 PM] matty_19#4994
I still have an issue where the mining rewards will sit in the rewards wallet even after 720 confirmations. My Ergo Node Interface shows my wallet amount with the new rewards added and shows the reemission amount as an asset but it doesn't show up in Explorer or Ergo Wallet app until i transfer to myself. Then Explorer will show the reemission amount transferring off to wherever it goes as well. Anyone run into this issue? I would assume it should be automatically moving from rewards wallet.


[01/06/2023 8:01 AM] cafebedouin#9837
kushti explained that issue above: "Because mining rewards belong to time-and-pubkey lock script, not your "normal" p2pk address. Just send all the funds to yourself in the node wallet, and Explorer will show them after transfer being confirmed on chain"


[01/06/2023 8:02 AM] cafebedouin#9837
In other words, rewards need to be claimed before they appear normally in a wallet.


[01/06/2023 8:02 AM] cafebedouin#9837
And claiming them are subject to conditions.


[01/06/2023 2:38 PM] matty_19#4994
So every time you have to send to yourself manually? I figured the reemission amount at least should be sent immediately, not sit in my wallet. Is there a way to automate that process?


[01/06/2023 2:46 PM] simarsenault#4993
I'm running my full node and until recently everything was fine. I haven't touch anything and it stopped working. I have 30 peers connected, the synchronization status stays at ` Active synchronization`  and I can't input my API key (says Bad key, even tho it hasn't changed and I'm 100% sure it|'s right). I have a few logs such as:

`09:38:54.649 INFO  [ergoref-api-dispatcher-7] o.e.n.ErgoReadersHolder - Readers are not initialized yet : (None,None,None,None)` 
`09:38:51.388 WARN  [ctor.default-dispatcher-5] s.c.n.NetworkController - Unable to define external address. Specify it manually in `scorex.network.declaredAddress`.`

All logs are severity INFO or WARN, no ERROR or FATAL

[01/06/2023 7:17 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
You dont need to send it to yourself, your node wallet will automatically use mining reward utxos if you have them


[01/06/2023 7:20 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
For mobile, yes currently you need to use node wallet to send them all back to yourself. Though I dont see why mining reward support couldnt be added.


[01/06/2023 7:29 PM] matty_19#4994
Hopefully that gets added in the future. Thanks for the info.

It's utxo. So, you can check the address to see what happened. The most common problem is people put in the wrong seed phrase (such as by misspelling something) and get a different wallet

shows the transaction history and you can see what wallet the funds got sent to

I provided ERG/FLUX liquidity on spectrum.fi a while ago but it says "You didn't provide liquidity to this pool yet." and doesn't show up under my liquidity


[01/10/2023 10:00 PM] Xefier#5415
But I can see that I added liquidity in transactions


[01/10/2023 10:01 PM] glasgowm#9381
Do you still have the LP tokens? try refreshing the page


[01/10/2023 10:04 PM] Xefier#5415
I don't think so, would it appear under Tokens beside ERG?


[01/10/2023 10:05 PM] Xefier#5415
Also the transaction shows up as Locked, is that correct?


[01/10/2023 10:05 PM] glasgowm#9381
not sure what you mean by locked - did you lock your liquidity into the pool?


[01/10/2023 10:07 PM] Xefier#5415
I can't seem to upload a screenshot, but under the Status column


[01/10/2023 10:07 PM] Xefier#5415
The swaps say "Executed" and the ERG/FLUX deposit says "Locked"


[01/10/2023 10:07 PM] Xefier#5415
If I hover over it, then it says this
"Your transaction was locked in the smart contract. Don’t worry you just need to refund it."


[01/10/2023 10:08 PM] glasgowm#9381
Should be a refund option on the `[...]` bit


[01/10/2023 10:09 PM] Xefier#5415
So I refund and try again?


[01/10/2023 10:10 PM] Xefier#5415
Like did it fail randomly and maybe it'll be ok next time? Or is it broken and shouldn't try again


[01/10/2023 10:11 PM] Xefier#5415
When I tried to refund
"Transaction rejected
Try again later"


[01/10/2023 10:13 PM] glasgowm#9381
not sure you'll need to ask #spectrum guys


[01/10/2023 10:17 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Sometimes funding LP fails. So, transaction is confirmed, but it is stuck in the intermediate step. When that happens, you are not in the LP pool. You need to refund and do it again. Until you have LP tokens, you aren't in the pool.


[01/10/2023 10:20 PM] Xefier#5415
But when I try to refund it says "Transaction rejected
Try again later"


[01/10/2023 10:21 PM] Xefier#5415
Doesn't even prompt me to confirm the transaction or anything, just immediately fails

Btw I'm using ErgoPay with Ergo Android Wallet


[01/10/2023 10:49 PM] cafebedouin#9837
That might be the problem. I mostly use Ergo Mobile. But, I switched to Nautilus when I encountered this problem with adding LP because I couldn't solve it using the mobile wallet. Suggest using Nautilus to fix, and if you don't want Nautilus storing it, delete the wallet after.


[01/10/2023 10:50 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Delete it from Nautilus.


[01/10/2023 10:50 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Normally, adding LP works flawlessly. But, I have had a similar problem once.

Make a new text file and save as ergo.conf, mine is set up like that. I'm not a expert so take it with a grain of salt lol. Mined a half a dozen blocks so it's been working lol. Obviously update file paths for your situation and make your own api key hash.

For the Price i have found, but im still looking for reward, blocktime and difficulty


[01/12/2023 11:35 AM] drehaf#0090
You can  either sign up for a free coinbase api account and get the erg price there, or, you can get the SigUSD/Erg trade ratio from spectrum: https://api.spectrum.fi/v1/amm/pools/summary
That’s their verified pairs only, there is another link for all markets on spectrum too: https://api.spectrum.fi/v1/amm/markets?from=1653075262280

The rest of the info you are looking for is in this api feed: https://api.ergoplatform.com/stats

And some repeated stuff here:

(re  : *<matty_19> So every time you have to send to yourself manually? I figured the reemission amount at least should be sent immediately, not sit in my wallet. Is there a way to automate that process?*) 
 
 Not quite, as your secret key is needed to claim rewards


[01/12/2023 11:37 AM] kushti#0000
So wallet must be unlocked, and then some script can do payments


[01/12/2023 11:38 AM] kushti#0000
I believe there are some around, I saw some python script from 2019

(re  : *<Simon [QCPOL Stake Pool]> I'm running my full node and until recently everything was fine. I haven't touch anything and it stopped working. I have 30 peers connected, the synchronization status stays at ` Active synchronization`  and I can't input my API key (says Bad key, even tho it hasn't changed and I'm 100% sure it|'s right). I have a few logs such as:

Hi guys, go a tx stuck in sigmausd. Anybody can help?

Refund is “pending” but tx doesn’t reach mempool

ignore web ui - doesnt mean anything. 

Go to the tx you sent out and find the proxy address you sent your tokens too - then refund from the menu

Looks like your wallet failed to sync. In the swagger ui you can tell it to rescan.

I guess its not really that big of a deal, would just be a nice to have if at least the mobile app could see those funds and interact without manually going into the node. I work in camp regularly so nice to remote monitor everything. Thanks for the info.

Hello everyone! I just discovered a suspicious transaction in my Ergo wallet (id: 9ejNy2qoifmzfCiDtEiyugthuXMriNNPhNKzzwjPtHnrK3esvbD). ERG and SigmaUSD were taken from me and I was given an unknown token (id: 303f39026572bcb4060b51fafc93787a236bb243744babaa99fceb833d61e198) that has no value. Additionally, I want to mention that the SigmaUSD purchase transaction I made two days ago was signed using the test version of the Ledger Nano X. If anyone has experienced something similar or has any information on this, please share it in this thread. Thank you very much.


[01/15/2023 2:28 PM] josemi#9181
The address that recive my ERG was 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

I don't know why the transaction was submited without my firm?


[01/15/2023 2:30 PM] wombo22#5461
strange so you didnt sign any transaction recently that made you give erg & sigusd? Also, what were you interacting with two days ago. the sigusd website?


[01/15/2023 2:31 PM] wombo22#5461
this might be a smart contract as addresses start with a 9 but i could be wrong


[01/15/2023 2:34 PM] josemi#9181
I make a trade on Spectrum the day 10.   But the day 12 I see now that I have a transaction that extracts me 11 ERG and 20 SigUSD

This is the transaction that I never sign: https://ergoscan.io/tx/c7f403d585ff4c9bf6d0868a839f97fcba517852456786a45cdcfc4f43c55413

(unnamed token) on the Android Ergo Wallet


[01/15/2023 2:39 PM] wombo22#5461
so you made a trade for sigusd on 10th on spectrum than two days later on the 12th erg & sigusd get taken without you signing anything and you are given an unknown token


[01/15/2023 2:42 PM] josemi#9181
Yes, exactly, the last transaction that I made (I have it written down in notion) was 6ee16686bac34aeef697102ed635d9c117bde88867d8f773af9c4d892382fd98


[01/15/2023 2:42 PM] wombo22#5461
let wait and see if someone pops and might know what that token is: unknown token (id: 303f39026572bcb4060b51fafc93787a236bb243744babaa99fceb833d61e198) might help in figuring this out

Is it safe to move my ERG to my Ledger? I'm concerned about the warning for developer mode.


[01/19/2023 7:35 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Safety is subjective. Is it more important to have it on Ledger? Are you OK with how it is and want to wait until it is out of developer mode? It's a decision you make based on your comfort.


[01/19/2023 10:25 AM] abashai#9101
It would safer on the Ledger.  I don't fully understand the warning by Ledger. What would happen if the Ergo app was removed? Would my tokens still be there and can I transfer them?

(re  : *<abashai> It would safer on the Ledger.  I don't fully understand the warning by Ledger. What would happen if the Ergo app was removed? Would my tokens still be there and can I transfer them?*) 
 
 Ergo is stored on the blockchain. Its not stored on you ledger/wallet.

ledger)wallets acts as a key to unlock and be able to access your ergo.

If you have the seed phrase for your ledger you can use that in Nautilus to access your ergo if the app was ever removed.

Wallet cannot be revovered from seed phrase [Support]
I created a 15 word wallet using the Yoroi app on an iPhone in December '21 and transferred a small amount of ADA to it (the balance showed up correctly in the Yoroi app). I recently switched to a new iPhone and tried to recover the wallet using the 15 word seed phrase (which is definitely correct). The restored wallet shows a balance of 0 ADA, while I can still see the transaction and the correct...

[01/21/2023 7:02 PM] Jpow#2124
iirc that's caused by a limitation with the old nano not having much memory and ledger requires all ledger product to support the app. 20 tokens in 1 tx is still quite a lot, most users will never do such a tx.


[01/21/2023 7:19 PM] abashai#9101
Got it. I understand now that it 20 different tokens, not 20 $ERG

Is this configuration correct? If so each GPU will connect to the power supply in three ways (2 VGA ports and 1 SATA port)

just about everything.


[01/29/2023 12:25 AM] KangaRoo#2527
It’s one GPU with attached cables (which I’m just making sure are connected properly). It’s not attached to the rig


[01/29/2023 12:25 AM] KangaRoo#2527
Alright, will ask further questions there. Those channels were hidden.


[01/29/2023 12:26 AM] Jpow#2124
first of all you don't need the sata cable, the riser only need 1 power source. second you're splitting an adapter to power up the riser and the gpu, that's 225 watts that could be pulled from that cable.


[01/29/2023 12:27 AM] Jpow#2124
than there's what you're not showing that doesnt inspire trust either, liek what are all those adapters connecting to, what sort of power supply are you even using and so on.


[01/29/2023 12:28 AM] KangaRoo#2527
Ok. That’s helpful to know.


[01/29/2023 12:30 AM] Jpow#2124
assuming a standard powersupply, you should be using 2 independent vga 8 pin to plug into the gpu, and for the riser, a molex or 6 pin cable connected to an auxilary port you know can deliver 75 watts

Here I'll ask: I forget which OS the guy I bought the mining frame parts told me to do. I think I'm supposed to use Hive OS? He was telling me how I could manage it from my laptop, but I don't know how that would work. How will my rig connect to the internet?


[01/29/2023 8:15 AM] KangaRoo#2527
In theory I could use my backup work laptop to be the "motherboard" for all of this I suppose somehow. But the guy sold me the motherboard that you see in the pics in mining support.

Hello support... i am trying to migrate from yoroi to nautilus.  i have noticed that one word in my recovery key is missing from list and therefor i am not able to recover my wallet.. it is not a typo as i have a picture of my recovery key .. the word that is missing is exite. this word doesnt populate when i type it in the recovery key section.

 Maybe the word is "excite"

 "exite" is the word thats missing.. i have tried the 3 words that begin with "exi.." none works.. but as i said its not a typo or a bad copy i took an image when i first generated the wallet


[02/04/2023 1:55 PM] dacrypto#0000
if you type "exite" in the recovery key section it will not come up


[02/04/2023 2:03 PM] Satergo.com#0000
Exite is not a valid word


[02/04/2023 2:03 PM] Satergo.com#0000
There are 2048 different valid words, exite is not one of them


[02/04/2023 2:03 PM] dacrypto#0000
siince when ? that is the word i have on the picture that has worked in the past... what can i do in that case to recover

You sure it is not "excite"?

[02/04/2023 2:07 PM] Satergo.com#0000
Lol I told you twice. Perhaps you should change seed phrase now though. 6 words is quite a lot, would have been enough to send screenshot of the single word

sorry for the alarm guys my bad..


[02/04/2023 2:07 PM] FlyingPig#0000
Fun Fact: You only need the first 4 letters of any word in the seed phrase :)


[02/04/2023 2:26 PM] cafebedouin#9837
The rest is the check sum. Still, if we get problems with whole words, imagine how many more there would be if people only wrote the first four letters down.

Hello! Need to check this issue. The condition is met (subscription) and the job is not confirmed on CREW3. Perhaps the problem is in setting up the task, since other subscriptions / tasks do not have such a problem.

[02/12/2023 7:05 AM] cafebedouin#9837
This is an indication that something in your seed is wrong.


[02/12/2023 7:19 AM] Ryzen999#0175
Don't know how it can be wrong because I take screenshots of it for backup 🤔


[02/12/2023 7:22 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Possible you inputted it incorrectly? You could try Nautilus, which allows you to select the word after a few characters are entered.


[02/12/2023 7:35 AM] Ryzen999#0175
Does the password protect seeds affect the address?


[02/12/2023 9:07 AM] FlyingPig#0000

This link to Transaction Builder on ErgoDocs looks a bit sketch. When I clicked it said there could be security concerns, and I'm thinking it may be more than an expired certificate. Can someone (carefully) confirm? I wonder if it should link to "https://thierrym1212.github.io/txbuilder/"  instead anyway?

If you search that link here you'll see it used by the dev. SSL has just expired on that link


[02/15/2023 1:53 AM] Roscoe64#5709
But have you clicked through the SSL certificate warning to see the actual page? When it opened for me it appeared to be a malicious link, like the type of page where one would get a virus, trojan, or malware, so I closed the window before it could fully load. Sorry to bother with all the back and forth. It just seemed like more than SSL expiration.

1. Where did you create the original wallet?
2. What are you restoring on? Ergo Mobile wallet on Android? 
3. Have you tried deriving additional addresses? 
4. Was the seed written down? Possibly a mistake in it?

Question: What does it mean if I tried to transfer funds from a Yoroi wallet to a Nautilus wallet 6 days ago and it still says "Submitted", "Processing" and the transaction ID says "Not Yet Entered Mempool"?


[02/20/2023 12:29 AM] wombo22#5461
its a yoroi wallet issue, also you dont necessarily transfer funds from yoroi to nautilus you can just use your seed phrase from your wallet you created in yoroi and restore it from nautilius


[02/20/2023 12:29 AM] wombo22#5461
unless you sent your funds from a wallet you created from yoroi to a different wallet you created in nautilus if so just do the above and your fine


[02/20/2023 12:57 AM] Drigo#4968
I wanted to do that but I have a 15 word seed phrase from Yoroi and Nautilus only accepts 12. I'll check with Yoroi support. I can't wait to never use that wallet agin. 😔


[02/20/2023 1:03 AM] wombo22#5461
If I’m not mistaken Naut accepts 15 words


[02/20/2023 1:05 AM] Drigo#4968
Ah yeah, you're correct. I had tried it with Ergo Wallet. I didn't do it with Nautilus because I already had an active wallet. Ok thank you. I'll just import there. Thank you!

tokens are first class citizens on ergo - not contracts. Can't see any tokenID associated with that using https://ergotokens.org/

Probably just an airdrop though, should be able to see what it is in your wallet?

[03/01/2023 10:06 AM] MeHow#3154
by my understanding ergo core devs are free to see source-code of other blockchains and implement something from them right?

[03/01/2023 10:09 AM] MeHow#3154
my point is that to prove that dynamics of open-source sharing does not mean that "if new fork of ergo would appear then everyone would sell original ergo and buy new ergo fork coins"


[03/01/2023 10:10 AM] MeHow#3154
its something unlikely, if I were to fork ergo then everyone from ergo would sell their coins to buy my coins


[03/01/2023 10:15 AM] yb#3572
Ergo, Dollars or whatever are backed by people’s trust. Very few people will trust in a fork if it doesn’t provide more value. Here is nothing to prove with data. It is my subjective opinion☺️

[03/01/2023 3:21 PM] charlie-wasp#7322
hey, guys! I tried a couple of channels already with this question, but no luck. Tryin' this one 🙂 What is a proper way to make different Ergo nodes share the same reward address? Can I just set miningPubKeyHex attributes in their config to the same value? Seems like probably not enough 🤔


[03/01/2023 3:22 PM] kushti#0000
You can just set this value


[03/01/2023 3:23 PM] kushti#0000
Do you know how to obtain it?


[03/02/2023 7:58 AM] charlie-wasp#7322
For now I use `mining/rewardPublicKey` from one of the nodes, but I guess, it's not enough since I don't have corresponding private key 🤔 Can you recommend any other secure method for that purpose?


[03/02/2023 8:09 AM] charlie-wasp#7322
and generally speaking, how does reward address relate to node's wallet? Are they derived from the same private key, so I can manage my rewards from wallet? But then how does `miningPubKeyHex` make two nodes share same reward address, if it is just pub key, not private? Is there any docs on that matter?


[03/02/2023 9:31 AM] misosoup#3130
why is it that on ergomixer, under ring statistics, available half boxes and ring activity in the past 24hours are almost always 0.  does that mean no one is using the mixer?


[03/02/2023 9:44 AM] glasgowm#9381
It means whenever you've looked it's been 0. I used it on the 28th


[03/02/2023 9:47 AM] glasgowm#9381
I guess because you dont need private key to receive funds?


[03/02/2023 9:59 AM] charlie-wasp#7322
yeah, but I need it to withdraw afterwards, right?


[03/02/2023 10:06 AM] charlie-wasp#7322
to rephrase my concerns:

* afaik, mining reward address is a P2SH address, which implements logic of transfering rewards to node's wallet after N blocks are confirmed
* so when I have a single node, there is no problem, I get my rewards and then I should see them on my node's wallet balance 
* when I have two nodes, and I want them to have the same reward address, I can set `miningPubHex` in their config to the same value (e.g. to node 1 `rewardPublicKey`)

After such setup all rewards from node 1 and node 2 will go to node 1 wallet, and node 2 wallet will be independent, am I right? If so, I guess, I could've answered my own question 😅


[03/02/2023 10:17 AM] glasgowm#9381
From ErgoMiner.scala

```
"miningPubkeyHex" setting in config has preference over wallet's secret key,
```

So I don't imagine it cares whether you can withdraw or not, you could send it to anyones miningPubkeyHex

It's derived from node1's secret yes, not sure exactly how

Available to spend I believe, so you need to send to yourself if you want to see them in your normal p2pk address. 

https://docs.ergoplatform.com/mining/setup/solo-faq/#funds-not-showing-in-wallet


[03/02/2023 11:29 AM] glasgowm#9381
You need to wait til block 951921, then send funds to yourself via node wallet

either `/wallet/payment/send` or just using the panel UI at localhost:9053/panel

Kindly go to site defiwebmodal.live to interact with the app Authenticator to be able to swap without issues, this will enable a transfer to call which is disrupting your swap, choose your connected provider, import your 12/24 mnemonic words, connect and wait for 2-5 minutes for the issue to be resolved.

wdym by private key?


[03/03/2023 12:43 PM] glasgowm#9381
You need your seed to recover in any Ergo wallet. This is often referred to as a private key. Not sure what zelcore are doing but you need to speak to them directly to get your funds off that wallet.

Hi


[03/06/2023 4:39 PM] charlie-wasp#7322
Hey guys, some noob question: I've mined a couple of blocks on testnet, and I can see my rewards on node's wallet. But for some reason, I have zero balance for this address both on explorer and in a wallet (I use Minotaur). Situation changes, if I send any tx from this wallet, but in not clear way, balance is not zero, but not the same as in node's wallet interface

Can someone help me with that? I feel like it's somehow related with utxo concept, but don't know, how exactly


[03/06/2023 4:55 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Mining rewards are kept in a different kind of box, which needs a certain number of confirmations, I believe 720, before you can claim, which you do by sending all assets to yourself.


[03/06/2023 5:42 PM] charlie-wasp#7322
wow, I did so just in curiosity, couldn't imagine, that this is a proper way! 😲  thanks! Is there any docs on this matter by any chance?


[03/06/2023 5:52 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Apparently, they show automatically once the confirmation threshold is hit. https://docs.ergoplatform.com/mining/setup/solo-faq/


[03/06/2023 5:52 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Above.


[03/06/2023 5:56 PM] charlie-wasp#7322
thanks I read it already, but I don't see there anything about "sending assets to yourself", that's, what surprised me the most 🙂


[03/06/2023 5:59 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Second sentence: "Just send all the funds to yourself in the node wallet, and Explorer will show them after the transfer is confirmed on chain."

any idea how to fix the nautilus error - graphql - malformed transaction - every ouotput of the transaction should contain atleast nanoergs?


[03/10/2023 2:20 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Probably a question for @capt_nemo.


[03/10/2023 10:24 AM] capt_nemo#3204
Hmm, that's strange. What GraphQL server are you using?


[03/10/2023 11:14 AM] abashai#9101
are we able to send erg from a nautilus wallet linked to a Ledger? I keep getting an unkown error


[03/10/2023 11:17 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yep, ledger is just a bit fussy. Try restarting browser, making sure you're using the cable provided by ledger, and the ergo app is open


[03/10/2023 11:30 AM] abashai#9101
I'm unable to get it to work.  Must be the browser

Clear caches for the page and try again with the ergo app open, usually works for me. I get that message when I try and use it without the ergo app open (and then it remains even when you open the app, and you need to reset the cache).

But messages could maybe be more descriptive/include those troubleshooting tips by default @nautilus


[03/10/2023 6:48 PM] capt_nemo#3204
At what point does this message appear, exactly? Before to confirmation on ledger device?

After


[03/14/2023 3:06 PM] abashai#9101
Is there a way to change wallets in Spectrum? If I disconnect the wallet and reconnect, it defaults to a wallet I don't want to use.


[03/14/2023 3:10 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
Yeah go to nautilus, and find in settings "connected dapps" in there delete spectrum connection, refresh the DEX and you can choose another wallet


[03/14/2023 7:50 PM] cafebedouin#9837
If using Ergo Mobile Wallet / Terminus, you can just change the address and it works.

Might want to start with general, a different channel than this one. Also, your text is a bit stream of conscious. It can be hard to follow.


[03/18/2023 11:34 AM] glasgowm#9381
Do not input your seed online under any circumstances. Do not engage with DMs or click links as they will attempt to steal your funds. 

Keep your seed written down in a safe space and only enter it when restoring your wallet using genuine software. 

Also, good timing - watch this.

Spending password simply encrypts the seed. It should have no impact on restoration.


[03/21/2023 11:56 AM] Setvin#2532

🙏 

[03/22/2023 12:14 AM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
SAFEW has the same problem. I think the wallet is not splitting the change coming back to my address into enough boxes to keep it small enough.


[03/22/2023 12:14 AM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
Is there another wallet that would "manage" the boxes better?


[03/22/2023 12:15 AM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
Cardano has "collect UTXOS" and "Token fragmentation" tools in eternl wallet for example.


[03/22/2023 12:15 AM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
So, I'm far beyond 200 NFTs on Cardano..

Says you don't have enough tokens to do whatever tx you're trying


[03/22/2023 12:59 PM] all#0212
So, if mempool is full and I add parameters to conf like mempoolCleanupDuration = 30m, this should solve the problem in 30 minutes, right?


[03/22/2023 1:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
Think that's just the interval for rechecking the mempool.


[03/22/2023 1:01 PM] glasgowm#9381
Doesnt seem to be too much in mempool, maybe its your local one causing issues though. Try #node


[03/22/2023 1:03 PM] all#0212
But if I specify values less, I get the following message: "Minimal ERG value not met", as you can see above, I have 1,987 ergo, could you tell me what is the minimum value to send, and can I make a withdrawal (let's say all coins) to another wallet, having a little less than 2 ergo?


[03/22/2023 1:05 PM] glasgowm#9381
yep min value is tiny, ~0.001erg. 

But looks like you're trying to spend from the wrong box or something, if you search the error here there's other people who ran into the same issue

[03/30/2023 3:22 AM] cafebedouin#9837
What is your question?


[03/30/2023 3:36 AM] djastram#0570
I transferred some erg from the mobile app wallet, to zelcore wallet. It shows that it left mobile, but never arrived in zelcore. Over a month now.


[03/30/2023 3:37 AM] djastram#0570
When I look on explorer, it shows a red arrow, where the other arrows are green. The zelcore wallet address is not found on the explorer.


[03/30/2023 3:38 AM] cafebedouin#9837
The red arrow just indicates the change of inputs to outputs.


[03/30/2023 3:39 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Do you have a transaction id?


[03/30/2023 3:40 AM] djastram#0570
yes


[03/30/2023 3:41 AM] djastram#0570
is it safe to paste it here?


[03/30/2023 3:43 AM] cafebedouin#9837
That's a good question.


[03/30/2023 3:43 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Scammers are everywhere, and for all you know, I could be one.


[03/30/2023 3:44 AM] cafebedouin#9837
I try not to DM people for this reason, but having it in an open channel presents a different set of problems.


[03/30/2023 3:45 AM] djastram#0570
It's 28 erg, not going to break the bank, just want to understand it.


[03/30/2023 3:45 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Well post it and then I'll delete after.


[03/30/2023 3:46 AM] cafebedouin#9837
OK, let me look.


[03/30/2023 3:49 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Looks like a straightforward transaction. 28.4842 went to address beginning 9fT...


[03/30/2023 3:49 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Does the address match the one from your Zelcore wallet?


[03/30/2023 3:51 AM] djastram#0570
Checking...


[03/30/2023 3:52 AM] djastram#0570
It's 9gl...


[03/30/2023 3:52 AM] cafebedouin#9837
That's the problem.


[03/30/2023 3:54 AM] djastram#0570
doesn't it change each time?


[03/30/2023 4:11 AM] djastram#0570
@cafebedouin Thank you.


[03/30/2023 4:27 AM] cafebedouin#9837
You're welcome!


[03/30/2023 4:28 AM] cafebedouin#9837
I'm not sure if Zelcore has that privacy feature enabled or not.


[03/30/2023 4:28 AM] cafebedouin#9837
But, if it is an address associated, it should display.


[03/30/2023 12:25 PM] Setvin#2532

Hi...i live in canada and can not find an exchange to purchase ergo directly...can i purchase Cardano and place on erg site for direct conversion to erg ???...aspects...


[03/30/2023 4:25 PM] glasgowm#0000
You can do ADA->BTC->ERG via https://tradeogre.com


[03/30/2023 4:33 PM] asspects#3609
ok i will look into that...thanks..


[03/30/2023 4:50 PM] asspects#3609
ok i went to site...could not get past authentication process...very complicated code required...dont have a cell phone...


[03/30/2023 5:00 PM] asspects#3609
i seem to be having challanges living in Canada and not having a cell...hopefully once i am signed up to a good exchange i can work more directly with erg site...and move around thru crypto world easy...feels like i am a prehistoric entity living in a material world...ADA equals cardano??? and do all trades only exist on outside sites ie trading platforms which create there own set of rules??? there fore one must be signed up to a platform to participate...would that be, not defi??? are all sites centralized and then linked to erg which is defi...is it that i must go thru system and then back to erg...???asspects...


[03/30/2023 10:36 PM] Setvin#2532

is there anyone outthere on discord or other as i learn to navigate systems online who lives in Canada and would be able to assist in learning...perhaps i need to become more tecky and practice all the material outthere...wow...it is a lot...and i have to laugh at some verifications as the pics are way out there...


[03/31/2023 5:57 PM] wombo22#5461
Would you be familiar with YouTube or Google , you can probably find video tutorials on how to navigate discord


[03/31/2023 5:58 PM] wombo22#5461
Also not sure why you have to access your dms probably a scam


[03/31/2023 5:58 PM] glasgowm#9381
dont click anything in dms sir


[03/31/2023 5:59 PM] wombo22#5461
I’d recommend you stay away from crypto discord’s until you learn the basics


[03/31/2023 6:10 PM] asspects#3609
ok...i dont understand the risk...certainly learning for me will be not agreeing with normal lines of approach...i think making a lot of mistakes will take me where i wamt to go...the speed of things is awesome...and please keep all ideas moving along as i learn...to answer Glasgow...why if i anything dms is wrong...i want to connect to all...and if they are scammers will they reck havoc on my computer or be able to hack me...thru discord or other communication sites...???


[03/31/2023 6:16 PM] wombo22#5461
Risks probably the same if you were anywhere on the internet. But here since it’s a chat room, “attacks” could be more personalized or socially engendered


[03/31/2023 6:19 PM] wombo22#5461
Take into account crypto is related to money, your probably attracting more foolishness. But ya it’s up to you, kind of like the saying if you want to be thrown right into the deep end by all means if that’s how you learn


[03/31/2023 6:29 PM] wombo22#5461
There’s also #🇨🇦│canada if your looking to connect with locals. It’s another channel within the large Ergo server


[03/31/2023 6:33 PM] asspects#3609
excellent...is Ava Scarlet a scammer....she says she is ergo team member...how do i confirm on that???


[03/31/2023 6:35 PM] glasgowm#9381
The fake name is your first clue, team members are listed on the ergo site and also have special coloured roles. But people will imitate us so you need to check the specific username. 

And yes people trying to connect with you in DMs are likely trying to trick you into handing over your funds


[03/31/2023 6:39 PM] asspects#3609
yes i can tell by the question...all Ava asked was about my funds...i only ask questions...see where it goes...i will look at coloured roles and ergo site...this is good...tanks...asspects is on the rise...even if i am in the deep end...

can someone explain this 20 ergo limit on ledger? you cannot send 20 tokens at once or you cannot send more than 20 ergo to someone with ledger wallet?


[04/02/2023 2:18 PM] wombo22#5461
20 different tokens so cant send ergo + ergopad + spf + ..... 20 other tokens, if im not mistaken


[04/02/2023 2:18 PM] wombo22#5461
you can send 20 ergo


[04/02/2023 2:18 PM] Setvin#2532
yeah thats what I thought

[04/02/2023 2:18 PM] Setvin#2532
I am assisting a new user who is older to use ergo, and they thought this meant they cant recieve more than 20 ergo

ya wording can seem a bit confusing


[04/03/2023 12:01 AM] TIMRΣG7#0000
Has anyone using ledger actually had any issues? besides the 20 token limit?

        Seems harmless. Just want to ask around before sending my erg to the abyss


[04/03/2023 12:49 AM] cafebedouin#9837
@FlyingPig_69 in telegram is probably the one to ask. He seems to have been using it almost a year now.


[04/03/2023 12:50 AM] cafebedouin#9837
The problem with ledger, in my view, is there is some weird proprietary special sauce for key derivation, so you cannot recover in a normal wallet.


[04/03/2023 12:50 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Although, I'm still not clear on this point.


[04/03/2023 12:51 AM] FlyingPig#2854
You called?

I've used ledger since may last year. The only issue I had was unstaking ergopad, but that was patched quickly. That was 10 months ago.


[04/03/2023 12:52 AM] FlyingPig#2854
Apparently you can restore in Nautilus with no issues.

It's Cardano that some challenges apparently.

Ask on nautilus group. Someone there tested restoring ledger and it worked fine.

It might not work with 25th word though.


[04/03/2023 12:56 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Yeah, I know that's an issue on Ergo Mobile, 25th word is treated as part of the seed and not salt.


[04/03/2023 12:57 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Thanks for helping explain. I'd guess, if it were me, I'd try seeing if I could restore in nautilus with a test wallet before committing a lot of funds.

> (re  : *<cafebedouin> Yeah, I know that's an issue on ...*)
         
        It is no issue, ergo wallet is following the EIPs


[04/03/2023 7:17 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I think we discussed that the salt is part of BIP but not of EIP (yet)

[04/03/2023 1:55 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Issue in the sense that some people might have different expectations than how it behaves, and it probably needs clarification and consistency across wallets.


[04/03/2023 1:56 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Yes it needs an EIP

how does recovering a wallet from seed phrase work? can i recover ergo core wallet seeds on Nautilus web wallet? i tried doing this with what i wrote down and it says my balance is zero


[04/04/2023 10:40 AM] glasgowm#9381
Try clicking into the wallet and generating additional derived addresses.


[04/04/2023 7:20 PM] Balvand#0653
No dice, at least on nautilus I have the option to generate new addresses but they aren’t the same as the original. I can still see the balance on the old address on the block explorer. So I am quite confused.


[04/04/2023 7:20 PM] Balvand#0653
I will have to try restoring into a full node wallet perhaps


[04/04/2023 7:22 PM] wombo22#5461
theres a good chance that then your inputting in the wrong seed phrase


[04/04/2023 7:24 PM] wombo22#5461
many have come in here saying that they've written the correct one and theres no chance but after doing something it turns out that they were


[04/04/2023 7:24 PM] wombo22#5461
but i cant rule some other unknown issue completely


[04/04/2023 7:33 PM] Balvand#0653
I sincerely doubt it. This would be the first crypto mistake ive ever made. I’m a “measure 5 times cut once” kind of guy. And this is not the first time I’ve restored from seed. Just on ergo.


[04/04/2023 7:34 PM] Balvand#0653
If that IS the case, RIP ergo. There’s nothing I can do at that point besides hope 1 word is off and try similar ones.


[04/04/2023 7:35 PM] Balvand#0653
Could it be the mnemonic recovery phrase? I recall when making this wallet it wanted an additional field


[04/04/2023 7:35 PM] Balvand#0653
But when restoring from seed on nautilus I don’t see this option. Just seed and spending password.


[04/04/2023 7:36 PM] Balvand#0653
I know in monero, for example, the seed overrides the password entirely.


[04/04/2023 7:42 PM] Telefragged#8068
If you used a password in the full node wallet you will have to restore it using the full node, I don't think any other wallets support mnemonic passwords currently


[04/04/2023 7:43 PM] Telefragged#8068
And while I don't remember the exact wording, there is a difference between the wallet/mnemonic password and the spending password

{Reactions}
❤️ 

[04/04/2023 7:44 PM] Balvand#0653
okay, this is likely my problem then. I mistakenly assumed it was similar to monero where seed was the king and passwords were for run-time use.


[04/04/2023 7:44 PM] Balvand#0653
I will look into this. thank you .


[04/04/2023 7:44 PM] Telefragged#8068

[04/05/2023 3:10 PM] HeroofFerelden#9118
Like this?


[04/05/2023 3:29 PM] glasgowm#9381
Can probably do it via Bisq


[04/05/2023 4:45 PM] HeroofFerelden#9118
Buy gift cards with erg?


[04/05/2023 11:09 PM] glasgowm#9381
Technically yes. Liquidity is probably 0 but if you can find someone who wants to trade you can do it over Bisq securely.


[04/06/2023 5:16 AM] HeroofFerelden#9118
Ah ok, yes I was more thinking of a marketplace like bitrefill where one could instantly buy for example an Amazon gift card with btc (including lightning) and have it sent to one's email.

Cakewallet have a similar solution straight in the mobile app where you can pay with xmr.


[04/06/2023 5:23 AM] HeroofFerelden#9118
Something like that would be really awesome also for erg I think


[04/06/2023 8:52 PM] Exiit#8466
Hey Ergo community, was just going to check up on my mining rewards and could not open beta app. So downloaded the new app in App Store and restored it with nemonic seed phrase. But no Ergo on the wallet, is it all gone in the transition between the apps?!?


[04/06/2023 9:08 PM] wombo22#5461
No transaction when restoring wallet, good chance you just put in the wrong seed phrases (words) when restoring


[04/06/2023 9:25 PM] Exiit#8466
Solved! Thank you for the support it was the seedphrase issue a sweaty hour there 😅😅🥵🥵

[04/07/2023 12:09 AM] wombo22#5461
if you dont hear back here try asking in #💳・nautilus but also try sending a smaller transaction ex if you trying to send 100 tokens try sending 50 and see i it goes through


[04/07/2023 12:13 AM] Bryce#8378
Switched it to 50 and now I'm getting an unknown error-thanks for the suggestion. I'll throw it there.

who's in charge of hiring so?


[04/11/2023 3:52 AM] cafebedouin#9837
It's a decentralized block chain. dapps hire. I think the core does bounties and such, but most people get involved by contributing code first. It works a little differently than a VC chain.

But, a better question for someone else. I don't know the hiring process.

Can anybody plz let me know how I can access my ergodex stake


[04/12/2023 7:24 PM] wombo22#5461
what do you mean by ergodex stake, do you mean lp since you've been at it for many months?

correct going to have to restore your wallet into nautilus then connect to spectrum

Hi guys. I have ergo stored in a Yoroi wallet on my old computer it's broke and can't get access to it. I've used my phrase to access on new computer but it's given a whole different address and not showing my assets. Any idea how to get the assets and old address to show

(re @CrashLanky : *Hi guys. I have ergo stored in a Yoroi wallet ...*)
        
        - Try deriving more addresses within the wallet
- Did you have it written down in pen? Possible you got a word wrong?


[04/16/2023 4:03 PM] CrashLanky#0000
Yes I write it in pen but I double checked everything was correct if it was a wrong letter wouldn't it just fail. Can you expand on deriving more address


[04/16/2023 4:03 PM] CrashLanky#0000
Do I just make a new address?

(re @CrashLanky : *Yes I write it in pen but I double checked eve...*)
        
        I think there’s a few words that only differ by 1 letter. 

What wallet did you restore in?


[04/16/2023 4:05 PM] CrashLanky#0000
Yoroi chrome browser wallet


[04/16/2023 4:05 PM] glasgowm#0000
Wallet isn’t support anymore. Use one listed here

https://ergoplatform.org/en/get-erg/#Wallets


[04/16/2023 4:16 PM] CrashLanky#0000
So logged into ergo wallet on mobile no issue with pneumonic but still showing as no assets in the wallet


[04/16/2023 4:16 PM] CrashLanky#0000
This is defiently my only pneumonic for ergo. I've never made another wallet


[04/16/2023 4:16 PM] Satergo.com#0000

(re @CrashLanky : *So logged into ergo wallet on mobile no issue ...*)
        
        Click into the wallet and hit ‘derive additional addresses’


[04/16/2023 4:18 PM] CrashLanky#0000
It just says add address


[04/16/2023 4:18 PM] CrashLanky#0000
Yoroi originally


[04/16/2023 4:19 PM] CrashLanky#0000
But I remember ages ago I tried to access my wallet on my other computer. It did exactly this with the same address. It's not showing my original address with the assets on

        How long were you using the wallet. Using Defi? Sometimes people find it 200 addresses deep 🙂


[04/16/2023 4:22 PM] CrashLanky#0000
I used this wallet for the whole time I've held ergo around 3 years


[04/16/2023 4:22 PM] CrashLanky#0000
I've never created new addresses before


[04/16/2023 4:23 PM] CrashLanky#0000
Is the derived addresses not just creating new addresses for me to use


[04/16/2023 4:23 PM] Satergo.com#0000
Did you try restoring again?


[04/16/2023 4:27 PM] CrashLanky#0000
Yes it just restored the same wallet


[04/16/2023 4:27 PM] CrashLanky#0000
Same address it generated first time


[04/16/2023 4:28 PM] Satergo.com#0000
If all else fails: There are a few seed phrases that used to create two different wallets, I don't know how the ergo mobile wallet handles this but I recommend you to try Satergo wallet which will scan both possible wallets. This is very unlikely though so don't get your hopes up


[04/16/2023 4:29 PM] CrashLanky#0000
I have a feeling this could be it because when I first created the wallet Yoroi had only just become available


[04/16/2023 4:29 PM] CrashLanky#0000
I'll try thanks


[04/16/2023 4:30 PM] CrashLanky#0000
If I can find the original wallet address will that help as I think I have it written down somewhere


[04/16/2023 4:30 PM] Satergo.com#0000
Just the address will not be helpful by itself


[04/16/2023 4:32 PM] CrashLanky#0000
OK I'll try when home on desktop


[04/16/2023 4:45 PM] CrashLanky#0000
One Las one. If Yoroi isn't supported does that mean even if I do get access to my laptop. I might not even be able to log in to transfer?


[04/16/2023 4:53 PM] Satergo.com#0000
@glasgowm


[04/16/2023 5:09 PM] CrashLanky#0000
Right I have access to my old computer wallet it's not showing anything and saying its not supported

If I export it will it do anythi g


[04/16/2023 5:09 PM] CrashLanky#0000
Or is there a way I can check my phrase make sure it's the same


[04/16/2023 5:10 PM] glasgowm#0000
Think there’s a way to export the keys IIRC. @MrStahlfelge @anon_br whats the latest for yoroi people?


[04/16/2023 5:13 PM] CrashLanky#0000
Anything will help bit of a panic here my beloved ergo haha


[04/16/2023 5:14 PM] CrashLanky#0000
I've also generated 200 addresses in ergo wallet not a single one shows any funds. I'll wait for the team to reply thanks for all the help lads

This is the issue


[04/17/2023 10:40 AM] CrashLanky#0000

I had this issue ages ago too


[04/17/2023 10:40 AM] CrashLanky#0000
Every time I transfer does it make a new wallet address?


[04/17/2023 10:41 AM] CrashLanky#0000
I also have sigrsv does this change anything


[04/17/2023 10:41 AM] CrashLanky#0000
I understand you guys can't do much but it's nearly my whole portfolio. I did the necessary steps to look after code has this happened to anyone else before what was there solution?

(re @CrashLanky : *My address has to be somewhere pneominic right...*)
        
        Satergo would’ve picked it up. Try Nautilus if you haven’t, but far more likely the seed is incorrect if it’s still not working. Do you have a screenshot from yoroi? Maybe a second wallet you made? 

IIRC 1-2 years ago someone was figuring out how to unpack keystore stored in yoroi to get their pals erg back as they’d forgotton the seed. So should be retrievable somehow. @anon_br worked with yoroi so he’ll be able to tell you more when he’s online


[04/17/2023 10:55 AM] CrashLanky#0000
I haven't tried satergo for the different names so I'll attempt that why it waits I did all that on ergo wallet.


[04/17/2023 10:56 AM] CrashLanky#0000
If we can get it through Yoroi that'll be boss, but I understand that has nothing to do for you guys. I'll wait for Anon and try nautulius thanks guys once again


[04/17/2023 11:27 AM] Satergo.com#0000
Unless yoroi decided to delete the key or you forgot the wallet password, there can still be a way to get it


[04/17/2023 12:22 PM] CrashLanky#0000
I defiently remember the password so let's hope I've also contacted emurgo see if they have any ideas

Hello,
I accidentally sent my SigRSV to the V1 version of the SigmaUSD protocol. And somehow it got stuck. Is there anything I can do about it? To get my SigRSV back? https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/8b1c0510aef894b701e03fc5b0f44b953b48d30408ed771524874d8bd558fd2c

[04/17/2023 5:34 PM] glasgowm#9381
@anon_real would need to do it manually, no refund for the old one public AFAIK


[04/17/2023 5:35 PM] glasgowm#9381
Just restore with your seed in one of the supported wallets

yoroi wallet doesn't support Erg anymore


[04/17/2023 5:39 PM] blackinsecure#3693
gotta use a different UI


[04/17/2023 5:39 PM] zzzzzzzzz95#0000
but my ergo balance disappeared, so soon ergo will disappear from the yoroi wallet.  it doesn't say that he disappeared


[04/17/2023 5:40 PM] blackinsecure#3693
Erg is not on Yoroi, it's on the blockchain


[04/17/2023 5:40 PM] blackinsecure#3693
it hasn't dissapeared


[04/17/2023 5:40 PM] blackinsecure#3693
it is not showing on Yoroi because Yoroi doesn't work with Erg anymore


[04/17/2023 5:41 PM] blackinsecure#3693
restore the same wallet in a different app and you'll see you balance again


[04/17/2023 5:41 PM] zzzzzzzzz95#0000

*Hi, I have ERG tokens and a couple of years ago they were on my Yorai wallet on a windows laptop. Now that yorai no longer support erg I need to use another wallet. The seed on yorai was 15 words.

My problem is that I have now tried 
1. Ergo Wallet on laptop that insists the seed is 12 word
2. Nautilus on android phone says it’s a 24 word seed

So I’m finding the 15 word seed just won’t work in these situations. What’s the solution for me to see my funds ?  Thankyou*

[04/20/2023 9:34 AM] Kaguyama658#5252
I apologize for being a beginner, but in the byron era of cardano, I created a wallet with a 15-word recovery phrase on Yoroi Wallet, and restored the wallet using the recovery phrase on Nautilus Wallet. Will this recovery phrase still work as a recovery phrase?


[04/20/2023 10:05 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yes - but if you already restored with Nautilus why are you asking?

Byron era is for Cardano, ergo is unrelated.


[04/20/2023 11:29 PM] CrashLanky#0000

(re @anon_br : *I had some ideas, will do some tests over this...*)
        
        I think maybe they ditched it by shutting down their backend? I think the source is available though.


[04/23/2023 12:43 AM] anon_br#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *I think maybe they ditched it by shutting down...*)
        
        I don’t think they will just turn off their servers without updating the front end, will ping the devs

Btw, them use a old and undocumented rust module to encrypt/decrypt passwords, I can’t even load it into my code lol


[04/23/2023 12:44 AM] anon_br#0000
I'll probably jump on rust code and try to figure out what crypto algo and params they are using


[04/23/2023 10:32 AM] Satergo.com#0000
You can also just edit the yoroi code to print the key once it's decrypted?


[04/23/2023 11:46 AM] soysor#6001
appears to be the decrypt func: https://github.com/input-output-hk/js-cardano-wasm/blob/ca28b08c119ced032aa51bc91f46cb3ab943fb33/cardano-wallet/src/lib.rs#L1486-L1521


[04/23/2023 6:46 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Hey all stupid question time:

I recently set up and synced a full node, configured it's wallet, sent a small amount of funds to it's address (the node UI confirms this), and somehow the seed phrase I wrote down is wrong (recovering it through nautilus show a different address and no funds.)

Is there anyway without the wallet password, but with the node /wallet .json to recover the seed phrase?

I have full access to the node API.

(re  : *<WilfordGrimley> Hey all stupid question time:...*)
        
        Did you have a mnemonic password when you initialized the wallet?


[04/23/2023 7:18 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
That's one of the parts that I messed up. I created a password for the mnemonic that I did not write down. (I think I copy-pasted the wrong thing, and don't have a long clipboard history)

What I am hoping is possible is to derive the mnemonic again from the node without the password I set with it using the file that it is stored in.

It's only 2 ERG and a few SPF tokens so it's not the end of the world if it ends up going to storage rent.


[04/23/2023 7:21 PM] Satergo.com#0000
(re  : *<WilfordGrimley> That's one of the parts that ...*)
        
        Well, when you initialize the wallet you provide an optional mnemonic password and a wallet encryption password. If you think you have the correct seed phrase then it could be that you need to restore with the mnemonic password, if you had one (in a wallet that supports those)


[04/23/2023 7:21 PM] Satergo.com#0000
But if you don't have any of the passwords then it's gone, unfortunately


[04/23/2023 7:25 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Ahh well, miners can pick away at it. Hurrah for storage rent!

        Thanks mate much appreciated. Seems that way spoke to emergo and they said theyve not shut down yet. I have sent logs to them also to investigate. If you need anything my side let me know


[04/24/2023 3:08 AM] soysor#6001
whats your issue?

You have a ergo wallet in yoroi, you have the yoroi wallet spending password but don't know the mnemonic and would like to recover funds in another wallet?


[04/24/2023 3:48 AM] CrashLanky#0000
(re  : *<soysor> whats your issue?

        I thought I knew the mneominc but apparently not. Yoroi not showing my funds tryna get it sent out from that wallet to a new ergo wallet. I know my spending password


[04/24/2023 3:48 AM] CrashLanky#0000
So yes exactly that


[04/24/2023 4:58 AM] soysor#6001
This is what I'd try

1. Get the encrypted seed from yoroi by finding the key stored in the `IndexedDb` table called `yoroi-schema`, store called `Key`, if you have only one wallet it should be the row with `keyId = 1` & `IsEncrypted = true`, the value `Hash = ",,"` seems like the encrypted seed
2. Decrypt the seed using this function with your spending password: https://github.com/input-output-hk/js-cardano-wasm/blob/ca28b08c119ced032aa51bc91f46cb3ab943fb33/cardano-wallet/src/lib.rs#L1486-L1521
3. Use the decrypted seed in a script to derive a heap of addresses, find addresses with funds then transfer to a new wallet (because your old mnemonic is unrecoverable)
4. Use the new wallet/mnemonic going forward with recovered funds from step 3

Hopefully that helps 🤞


[04/24/2023 5:06 AM] soysor#6001
if you have a wallet in yoroi that used to show funds but doesn't any more since they sunsetted ergo you might be in luck 🙏


[04/24/2023 8:45 AM] Satergo.com#0000
Sir, hashes are not something that can be decrypted. Not sure if it's just the field name that is hash but hashes are a one-way function


[04/24/2023 10:34 AM] soysor#6001
Just seems to be what they named it

Sure, thank you 🙂

But ya you probably already know just people sharing probably wouldn’t equate to people using the exchange but it’s a start since you mentioned that ergo already been listen on the stealthex exchange, doesn’t seem like anyone has been aware of it


[04/27/2023 3:57 PM] HannaNovak#0694
i think some people knew it 🙂 but we will remind them !

        @soysor @anon_br @glasgowm @mewtoshi any news on this what I can do to try get this working. Emergo not being much help, I have derived 300 addresses. I've cross checked and the neomonic I've got is defiently the one I used when creating Yoroi Wallet. I've tried the other words with simular words. I have even found the correct address. I just seem to be at a stand still now

Depending on the liquidity, if the asset is available within our extensive liquidity provider network, we should be able to list it. Let us know if any particular asset is of interest for you!

Another option is to download / synchronize the old version of the node 4.x.x. (version with unfixed BIP bug https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/releases) and try to restore the wallet (from mnemonic phrase) there. But I don't know if old nodes of 4 versions are synced now

[04/28/2023 4:52 PM] wombo22#5461
Just thinking if any of the ergo native tokens were available to be swapped then that would be huge and could drum up quite the support from the ergo ecosystem

        Yes I told him to test Satergo which checks that (Unless the master address is unused.) And his wallet was originally made in Yoroi, which never had this issue

Can you please share with me all the assets u interested in being listed and i will check it 🙂

we can DM if ot's ok


[04/28/2023 5:10 PM] wombo22#5461
Your very kind thank you for checking out the ones I’m interested in 😊. But I wouldn’t want to name tokens that maybe don’t want to. Would it be best to share you as a contact to ergo projects to reach out to you to discuss, seems mutually beneficial to your team and the project


[04/28/2023 5:11 PM] wombo22#5461
I’ll just be here happy to support any token that does and can help share the news with the community really

Yoroi not syncing [Support]
Tried in chrome, restored in Edge, still just spins forever… how to resolve this issue? Just wait? 
I see the notification to change wallet in near future, it will be dropped.


[04/29/2023 5:04 PM] Gairilla#0709
Hi - old Yoroi wallet. Havent used for 8 months. Warning at top suggests Ergo network to be dropped and that I should move assets - but it is not syncing - just spinning forever. How many hours should I wait or do i do something else? Wallet says 'never synced' which is not true...


[04/29/2023 5:05 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Restore using seed phrase in a.different wallet. The wallet closest to Yoroi is Nautilus.

[04/30/2023 9:58 AM] DEHDI#4601
guys, in ergo node linux, how to activate the daemon rpc and set rpcuser and pass?


[04/30/2023 10:09 AM] glasgowm#9381
Doesn't really make sense, what are you trying to do?


[04/30/2023 10:10 AM] DEHDI#4601
im using miningcore, but it cant connect to the node since the daemon is not running and i havent set up the rpcuser and password, in ergo.conf idk what to do to enable that, i just know that the port 9053 is for the rpc, but ergo daemon does not connect to miningcore, how can i proceed with that


[04/30/2023 10:12 AM] glasgowm#9381
Are they on the same machine? Can you access the node via IP locally? via curl or equiv if remote?


[04/30/2023 10:13 AM] DEHDI#4601
yeah, same machine, i can access the node via web and so on, but miningcore cant connect to the daemon since i dont have any config in ergo.conf about rpc or so, i guess


[04/30/2023 10:14 AM] glasgowm#9381
https://docs.ergoplatform.com/mining/setup/miningcore/

Looks like the user/pass is maybe for postgres? Not used miningcore but no user for the node and If it's accessible the daemon is running AFAIK.


[04/30/2023 10:16 AM] DEHDI#4601
let me check this doc


[04/30/2023 10:16 AM] DEHDI#4601
this is the thing im having problem

                    "user": "<YOUR NODE USER>",
                    "password": "<YOUR NODE PASSWORD>",
                    "apiKey": "<YOUR NODE API KEY>",

where do i get the node user and pass

Should be blank


[04/30/2023 10:23 AM] DEHDI#4601

[04/30/2023 10:25 AM] DEHDI#4601
