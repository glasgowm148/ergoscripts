My env is Win10 x64, VS2019

[02/02/2020 7:27 PM] mrKraft#5706
I briefly checked httplib.h file, but didn't find any problem in it.


[02/02/2020 7:49 PM] mx#5165

This is a feature to be implemented on frontend side

also I can't import my wallet @ Magnum via seed because I don't know where I can find the Derivation Path


[02/11/2020 7:16 AM] mx#5165
in Magnum you click on import mnemonic phrase, then it scans all blockchains integrated with that seed, where is derivation path needed?


[02/11/2020 7:19 AM] mx#5165
and probably you will need to sync node on laptop from the start to see balance after importing seed


[02/11/2020 7:21 AM] mx#5165
in light node looks that there is some error appearing in console, maybe restart and try again


[02/11/2020 7:23 AM] mx#5165
@filippounits


[02/11/2020 7:27 AM] kushti#0978
@filippounits the wallet is not doing backwards scanning yet, unfortunately, so rescan is needed on your fullnode


[02/11/2020 7:27 AM] kushti#0978
@filippounits can you please send me lightnode logs ?

but if they don't do rescan it will rather doesn`t show anything either


[02/11/2020 8:13 AM] mx#5165
so these wallets are basically only useful at the moment when you are creating new wallet


[02/11/2020 8:14 AM] mx#5165
there is no rescan functionality yet like in Bitcoin


[02/11/2020 11:43 AM] kushti#0978
@mx Magnum is interacting with explorer, which is collecting data for all the addresses so no rescan is needed

so you just used the main scan correct without any path?


[02/11/2020 7:36 PM] filippounits#3593
cause I've set olso the mnem psw, when I've put the seed, I've put the mnem psw also

also*


[02/11/2020 7:36 PM] filippounits#3593

@kushti Where are the log files kept by default with version 3.2.1, it used to be in the same directory with previous versions. I am trying to investigate a strange issue with the node, it seems to accept duplicate block submission for a PoW with the same block header.


[02/28/2020 9:23 PM] kushti#0978
@BigEvilSoloMiner the simplest solution would be to run a node with 

java -jar  -Dlogback.stdout.level=DEBUG ergo-3.2.1.jar --mainnet -c mainnet.conf 

and then console output will contain (a lot) of DEBUG-level messages

send logs to me please if looks like a bug indeed

Does anyone know what might cause a full node to not stay syncd with the mainnet?  I have a node that is stuck at `full height` of 107279 when the actual value when I go to the mainnet browser is something like 192000.  Is there a way to kick a node to get syncd up with the mainnet short of deleting the wallet and history and doing a wallet restore and a full resync?

@Bauhaus911 well,as discussed in PMs, your problem is about corrupted database (on 32-bit platform), so yes, deleting everything (but wallet/keystore and wallet/storage folders if you want to store your keys) is needed


[04/01/2020 9:22 AM] kushti#0978

just put the seed (and the mnem psw if exist) without entering the path

@Cheng Wang and if you remove "/wallet" folder , then full blockchain rescan is needed currently.

        # Hex-encoded Blake2b256 hash of an API key.

[06/03/2020 6:55 PM] mx#5165
miner`s config should look similar to this


[06/03/2020 6:55 PM] mx#5165
{
  "mnemonic": "xxx xxx xxx",
  "node": "http://127.0.0.1:9053",
  "keepPrehash": true
}


[06/03/2020 6:56 PM] mx#5165
if there was mnemonic pass used during wallet creation, it needs to be added


[06/03/2020 6:59 PM] mx#5165
hopefully you have at least few hundred GPUs to mine with, looks like incoming pools will have more optimized miners integrated


[06/03/2020 7:00 PM] Draeth | $ARRR/$NLIFE/BPSAA#3300
na, just messin around with 1 gpu


[06/03/2020 7:00 PM] Draeth | $ARRR/$NLIFE/BPSAA#3300
now it's saying generated and received public keys don't match


[06/03/2020 7:02 PM] scalahub#2618
ok that is a much better error üôÇ


[06/03/2020 7:02 PM] mx#5165
if you don`t remember if you used mnemonic pass during wallet init, then try to delete wallet folder, restart and create wallet again, otherwise you will need to add mnemonicpass line  to miner's config


[06/03/2020 7:04 PM] mx#5165
it will be also needed for example if you would like to import wallet in Magnum


[06/03/2020 7:27 PM] Draeth | $ARRR/$NLIFE/BPSAA#3300

[06/03/2020 7:30 PM] Draeth | $ARRR/$NLIFE/BPSAA#3300
one last question. How is the network hashrate so crazy high?!


[06/03/2020 7:32 PM] mx#5165
looks like there are some memory hard flaws found by industrial miners(so they may have like ~x4 advantage now) but they vote to fix them so still hashrate is coming by my opinion from GPUs and not necessarily will change much after fix


[06/03/2020 7:35 PM] mx#5165
most hashrate increase from ~1 to now ~6 TH/s in last months is coming from competition between two big guys as for my looking


[06/03/2020 7:35 PM] mx#5165
for long time there was almost 0 competition


[06/03/2020 7:38 PM] mx#5165
small miners were knocked out basically day by day from the start


[06/03/2020 7:43 PM] mx#5165
after changes looks like Ergo has chance to support mostly GPUs community only, should be unique again then,  including enabling competition of GPUs with these https://www.ospreymining.io/product-page/ecu50

Node web panel says everything is ok but the node keep saying "zero modifiers to download" or something like that

And show that error very often


[07/29/2020 5:10 PM] ponte#8953
I have to mention that this pc is in another house and if there's power outage it reboots automatically and load a bat file to start the node


[07/29/2020 5:11 PM] ponte#8953
So probably the node had a violent shutdown due to power loss of the pc (it happens time to time)

Hello.  I'm running a node on Win10; since changing from 3.2.7 to 3.3.0 my ERG balance for my wallet address is reported as zero.  However, the same address on the explorer confirms the balance is there.


[08/10/2020 9:54 PM] weistanbo#6812
I have tried deleting the application and wallet, state, history and .ergo files with no luck.  Can someone help me fix this issue?


[08/10/2020 9:55 PM] weistanbo#6812
(after deleting, reinstalled and resynced wallet, with no success)


[08/10/2020 10:00 PM] weistanbo#6812
Have also queried Swagger w/wallet transaction IDs and this is the result: {
  "error": 404,
  "reason": "not-found",
  "detail": null
}


[08/10/2020 10:01 PM] weistanbo#6812
This is despite the fact my node interface shows the wallet address with the transaction ID associated on explorer


[08/10/2020 10:04 PM] Robert K#0722
@weistanbo This probably isn't the case, but are you running any dApp that registers UTXO-set scans?


[08/10/2020 10:04 PM] Robert K#0722
Because scans take precedent over the wallet, and so you won't see the boxes/funds in the wallet if they do get picked up.


[08/10/2020 10:11 PM] weistanbo#6812
No, no dApp


[08/10/2020 10:14 PM] Robert K#0722
Did you restore the wallet with your mnemonic?


[08/10/2020 10:15 PM] weistanbo#6812
Yes


[08/10/2020 10:15 PM] Robert K#0722
I believe the db formats between 3.2.X and 3.3.0 are different


[08/10/2020 10:16 PM] Robert K#0722
Hmmm, the only thing I can suggest then would be to delete your `.ergo/wallet/registry` folder, which will rescan the blockchain from blockheight 0.


[08/10/2020 10:16 PM] Robert K#0722
(Do this after you restored your mnemonic with your node)


[08/10/2020 10:16 PM] weistanbo#6812
Ok, I will try this


[08/10/2020 10:16 PM] weistanbo#6812
Appreciate your help


[08/10/2020 10:20 PM] kushti#0978
@weistanbo please delete .ergo/wallet/registry, also, after starting the node do wallet unlock - lock - unlock please (if you had only one address in your wallet, otherwise, unlock would be enough). the node will convert keys into a news format then and rescan the wallet


[08/10/2020 10:29 PM] weistanbo#6812
Ok I will try this as well


[08/10/2020 10:42 PM] weistanbo#6812
Have deleted wallet/registry and currently rescanning from restored mnemonic.  Also have done unlock-lock-unlock.  Will update w/results.  Thank you for your time


[08/10/2020 10:45 PM] kushti#0978
rescan should be pretty fast

but everytime I restart I have to reinitialize wallet from mnemonic phrase, is there any better way to do it ?

[09/02/2020 6:31 PM] filippounits#3593
manually withdrawn


[09/02/2020 6:33 PM] anon2020a#8187
> manually withdrawn
@filippounits Ok so are the transactions generated or it says they are being generated?


[09/02/2020 6:41 PM] filippounits#3593
1 tx with 0 Round have "queued" status than say "Transaction is being generated", the other tx have 7 Rounds, "running" status than say "Transaction is being generated"


[09/02/2020 6:45 PM] anon2020a#8187
That is weird. If you DM me your log file then I can investigate.


[09/02/2020 6:45 PM] filippounits#3593

Hi, I'm following the tutorial on the Ergo website in order to install the native wallet as I would like to get involved, buy some coins, and then not hold them on a CEX. 
Win10 user. 
I'm at a part where I've been instructed to run  `java -jar ergo-<release>.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf` in powershell, however when I do I get the following result

@Narrator you must install Java


[09/10/2020 8:12 AM] Narrator#2693
hmmm I did install Java, I guess I'll give the comp a restart?


[09/10/2020 8:13 AM] scalahub#2618
Does the command 'java' on its own work? Can you try and paste the output

[09/10/2020 8:16 AM] scalahub#2618
Run 'cmd' first and then in the window that opens what does typing 'java' output?


[09/10/2020 8:18 AM] Narrator#2693
Just did a restart before running it

Thank you.  
For the 'before reading try this part' is that in my CMD line or powershell?


[09/10/2020 3:04 PM] scalahub#2618
try in `cmd` after entering the `c:\ergo` folder


[09/10/2020 4:46 PM] ponte#8953
@Narrator hi, did u manage to get java work?


[09/10/2020 6:04 PM] Narrator#2693
@ponte I just finished with my tasks I was buried in and am going back to start trying where I left off yesterday.  I'll let you know within the hour


[09/10/2020 6:11 PM] ponte#8953
@Narrator within the hour i'll be driving but i'll get back as soon as i get home!


[09/11/2020 12:22 AM] Narrator#2693
@ponte  I haven't been able to get it to work after trying the previous instructions and suggestions listed here.


[09/11/2020 12:22 AM] Narrator#2693
I've been attempting to read up on the various elements (I unfortunately only was able to get started about an hour ago) and can't seem to find out what's wrong


[09/11/2020 8:12 AM] ponte#8953
@Narrator the issue is still with java? if so we can try to declare system variables for windows. maybe better start with a fresh installation of java?


[09/11/2020 8:21 AM] ponte#8953
@Narrator go to "control panel" -> "programs" -> "uninstall a program" and uninstall Oracle Java than reboot your pc


[09/11/2020 12:19 PM] Narrator#2693
@ponte for clarity of what I'm doing the only uninstall that I can target concerning Java is - Java(TM) SE Development Kit 14.0.2 (64-bit)  Is that what we're after


[09/11/2020 12:19 PM] Narrator#2693
I'll be around for the day now and will watch for replies to try to get this solved.   Ty for your help, idk why this is such an issue atm


[09/11/2020 12:20 PM] ponte#8953
@Narrator let's try to declare variables without unistalling java


[09/11/2020 12:21 PM] ponte#8953
use "find" and write in there "system variables" it should appear: "edit the system environment variables" click that


[09/11/2020 12:22 PM] ponte#8953
on the window it will appear you may look for "environment variables..." down right


[09/11/2020 12:22 PM] Narrator#2693
ok I'm there


[09/11/2020 12:23 PM] Narrator#2693
This part is familiar from a tut I think I went through so I have 2 variables populated already leading to jdk-14.0.2, and I'll do them again


[09/11/2020 12:24 PM] ponte#8953
make sure u set the path in system variables leading to the bin folder in jdk-14.0.2 ecc


[09/11/2020 12:24 PM] Narrator#2693
What is displayed is 2 boxes, one is for system variables, one is for user variables.  Both are for Environmental variables


[09/11/2020 12:24 PM] Narrator#2693
Making a new one now.


[09/11/2020 12:25 PM] ponte#8953
okay, did u point to the /bin folder inside java folder?


[09/11/2020 12:25 PM] Narrator#2693
Does it matter what I enter for the variable name?  Or is that arbitrary?


[09/11/2020 12:25 PM] ponte#8953
eheh don't know, just put java in there BUT


[09/11/2020 12:25 PM] ponte#8953
in system variables you should see a variable called PATH


[09/11/2020 12:26 PM] Narrator#2693
this is my path, i used the browse directory... button to get there


[09/11/2020 12:26 PM] Narrator#2693
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-14.0.2\bin


[09/11/2020 12:26 PM] ponte#8953
oh


[09/11/2020 12:27 PM] ponte#8953
so try to close cmd and open a command prompt again


[09/11/2020 12:28 PM] Narrator#2693
ok which command am I running to check for java?


[09/11/2020 12:28 PM] Narrator#2693
`"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-14\bin\java" -jar ergo-3.3.1.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf`


[09/11/2020 12:28 PM] ponte#8953
is here you put the java bin folder, right?

as you see there is already a "path" variable, the path to java folder should be added IN there,


[09/11/2020 12:30 PM] ponte#8953
so you click "path"


[09/11/2020 12:31 PM] ponte#8953
"edit"


[09/11/2020 12:31 PM] ponte#8953
"new" than u can browse to the java/bin folder


[09/11/2020 12:31 PM] Narrator#2693
oh


[09/11/2020 12:32 PM] Narrator#2693
that's where my PuTTY path and stuff is stored, this kind of makes more sense.  I apologize for not understanding faster.

[09/11/2020 12:41 PM] ponte#8953
cool, so now you can try running the ergo node jar file


[09/11/2020 12:43 PM] ponte#8953
so you move with cmd to your ergo folder


[09/11/2020 12:43 PM] ponte#8953
mine is c:\users\ema (that's me)\ergo


[09/11/2020 12:44 PM] ponte#8953
in that folder you should have put the ergo-3.3.2.jar file AND the ergo.conf configuration file

here's my output

and it generated a ergo.log file in the ergo folder


[09/11/2020 12:46 PM] Narrator#2693
i can go back and do it from cmd if you'd rather


[09/11/2020 12:47 PM] ponte#8953
not sure, but let's keep it running for the moment and now you can go check the node panel at "http:\\127.0.0.1\theportyouchose in ergo.config


[09/11/2020 12:48 PM] ponte#8953
like mine is port 9052, so the node panel is "127.0.0.1:9052


[09/11/2020 12:48 PM] Narrator#2693
how do I identify port?


[09/11/2020 12:48 PM] ponte#8953
oh, this has to be wrote in a browser


[09/11/2020 12:48 PM] Narrator#2693
right


[09/11/2020 12:48 PM] ponte#8953
the port is up to you, in the ergo.conf file it should be specified


[09/11/2020 12:49 PM] Narrator#2693
I should prob pick back up with the tutorial I didn't get that far to enter the port in the conf


[09/11/2020 12:49 PM] ponte#8953

[09/11/2020 12:57 PM] Narrator#2693
I saw the recent 3.3.2 release.  When this occurs do I just replace the .jar file and run the `java -jar ergo-<release>.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf` cmd again to initialize it?


[09/11/2020 1:06 PM] ponte#8953
well some versions require you to delete the /wallet/registry subfolder


[09/11/2020 1:07 PM] ponte#8953

fa921f32f2202e3275add54e4578b7114d2e4cad76f76bc065474a70dd95c6fd
Nothing is coming up on the ergo explorer


[10/08/2020 11:07 PM] SnaeuX#2503
Hello, I seem to having an issue with setting my api key to access nodes requests. When I enter my word I get the message 'bad ip key' is anyone able to give me some advice?

Same here got failed transaction when I withdraw my ergs to my yoroi wallet. I was using Coinex Exchange

Hi guys, pretty simple question I hope


[10/09/2020 12:33 PM] Nick [·¥è ü·¥á·¥ú·¥ç]#2333
Is there a way to restore my old account (I have the seed) to a new wallet on yoroi extension


[10/09/2020 12:34 PM] Nick [·¥è ü·¥á·¥ú·¥ç]#2333
or sounding like maybe hold off using yoroi for a bit?


[10/09/2020 12:35 PM] Cyphrym#6140
Already sent support ticket to Coinex Exchange they said something about node issue.

[10/09/2020 12:36 PM] Nick [·¥è ü·¥á·¥ú·¥ç]#2333
Its just a while since I installed node/wallet and I often delete everything and just save seeds


[10/09/2020 12:36 PM] Nick [·¥è ü·¥á·¥ú·¥ç]#2333
do I have to reinstall/synch a node to get my ERG to the yoroi?


[10/09/2020 12:37 PM] Nick [·¥è ü·¥á·¥ú·¥ç]#2333
or can I use the seed?


[10/09/2020 12:47 PM] Robert K#0722
The mnemonic you have from the ergo node is using an old scheme which means you'll need to restore it in a node.


[10/09/2020 12:47 PM] Robert K#0722
In the next Ergo node update the default for the full node will be the same as Yoroi, and they will be interoperable.


[10/09/2020 12:50 PM] Cyphrym#6140
> In the next Ergo node update the default for the full node will be the same as Yoroi, and they will be interoperable.
@Robert K So does this mean that is why we have a failed tx since Yoroi node and Ergo node are not the same at the moment?


[10/09/2020 12:51 PM] Robert K#0722
No, that is entirely a different issue and unfortunately I am unsure why.


[10/09/2020 12:51 PM] Robert K#0722
Those comments were just about wallets/mnemonics.

@Robert K I see I will just wait for Coinex to resolve it then. Thanks for replying.

@CushtyCrypto I wonder what exchange you are using since I have also failed withdrawal transaction to my Yoroi wallet.

[10/10/2020 5:15 PM] Bene#2546
i was not able to build my miner based on the setup guide so i found a github link and downloaded a pre-set miner (AutolykosGPUWin64binary-master)

> @CushtyCrypto CoinEx ?
@kushti  Nothing coming out for me either on ergo explorer and it has been more than 48 hours since I withdrawn my ERGs from Coinex. This is what Coinex gave me as my tx id -> https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/e85b5c309b625da5214ddf8c5649d419ed724f3b439bc52a2c330bd5bcc3fc2c , Is it true that "withdrawal had been delayed due to the instability issue of the official node" ?, that's what they told me.


[10/11/2020 8:11 PM] kushti#0978
@Cyphrym a combination of issues, including one with the node it seems. Most of withdrawals are okay, but few are failing. Can be fixed on their side solely before a fix in the node. Talking with them.

Hi. I do not think that my miner is mining correctly. Based  on the FAQ rom ergopool.io my miner should have an output of 
{
 "msg": "...",
 "pk": "...",
 "pb": "...",
 "b": "..."
}

Currently my miner is showing

{
 "msg": "...",
 "pk": "...",
 "b": "..."
}


[10/15/2020 10:53 PM] Bene#2546
what do i need to do to get the "pb" to be produced by the miner


[10/16/2020 8:32 AM] kushti#0978
@Bene are you mining with ergopool ?


[10/16/2020 8:37 AM] Bene#2546
I'm not sure. In my config file, I have the localhost and the port number. Was I supposed to have the ergo pool link?


[10/16/2020 8:38 AM] Bene#2546
I don't think I'm mining with ergopool

@kushti 

> No, miner need to get `pb` for send share to proxy


[10/16/2020 10:18 AM] kushti#0978
@Bene if you're doing solo pb is not needed then


[10/16/2020 12:40 PM] Bene#2546
Okay but I'm not seeing any shares. Valid or invalid. I followed all of the guides provided. The only guide that was different was the one on the ergopool.io where there is a step to setup a proxy


[10/16/2020 12:42 PM] Bene#2546
Is setting up a proxy required or can I just have a full node and miner running? @kushti


[10/16/2020 12:42 PM] kushti#0978
@Bene yes, but then you're mining with ergopool?


[10/16/2020 12:43 PM] Bene#2546
I want to mine with ergopool. I'm just not sure how to connect to the pool


[10/16/2020 12:55 PM] zargarzadehmoein#2928
> I want to mine with ergopool. I'm just not sure how to connect to the pool
@Bene 
Oh, I thought you want solo mining

for mine with ergopool, you need set up the proxy between your node and miner, for this using this (https://ergopool.io/how/)

I've a question: why if the mempool have more than 50 tx waiting for to be confirmed, miners does not include any transaction in new blocks? the only tx that they include is the coinbase and i.e. in the last 3 blocks 0 tx where processed, just the coinbase.

so you  can't connect to them


[11/14/2020 10:33 PM] mmahut#8044
@kushti ah, thank you, I missed this, I assumed without the flag it will do testnet as in monero, do you plan to have a testnet that is public in the future?


[11/14/2020 10:35 PM] kushti#0978
@mmahut it was until recently, now as we're testing new PoW, there were few new testnets in short period of time, so new network magic bytes were introduced for them (so your peer can't connect to testnet now without config modification and using code from non-master branch)


[11/14/2020 10:35 PM] kushti#0978
We don't have resources atm to support few testnets in paraleel (


[11/14/2020 10:37 PM] mmahut#8044
no worries, I will use mainnet, I'm trying to write integration tests for ergo yoroi backends and I have seen the testnet is just a fraction of the mainnet so hoped for a quick sync from scratch, but I work around it with a snapshot, thank you!

I've been mining for about a week at ~50 MH/s.  In what timeframe might I see a mining reward? I ask not because I need ERG. I just need final confirmation that I am actually **mining** ERG (even though Robert Kornacki commented that my terminal session looked good).


[11/25/2020 1:56 PM] kushti#0978
@claven many months, so better to join a pool after the HF coming


[11/25/2020 1:56 PM] kushti#0978

[11/25/2020 2:00 PM] Robert K#0722
After the HF in the next month or two, you'll get a much better chance with pools coming into the ring

Well, recent ADA price movement will support the electricity for POW. üôÇ


[11/25/2020 2:04 PM] claven#9099
Final question: Does a GPU with 50 MH/s support the network just as much as a GPU with, say 5 MH/s? If yes, I'll spin up a lower power-consuming machine and use the high end graphics card for World of Tanks.


[11/25/2020 2:05 PM] kushti#0978

polling the /info page on the rest API shows NULL for all the block header entries

@masonjar "headersHeight" in /info


[01/20/2021 5:18 PM] masonjar#4454
thanks, i guess i had an issue with my storage because after i deleted and restarted sync, i was able to see the block height.

@Sutton | aeriolabs.xyz they are using its own transaction assembly procedure, and it is not flawless, so sometimes invalid transactions being generated. I proposed a fix few months ago and thought it was applied but it is not. Please ask support to resend transaction. I am now pushing  them to fix the things finally. Hopefully this week will be finally fixed.

I'm trying to install the Nvidia miner following this guide: https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_05_07_mining/ with no success.
I follow the steps until to build the libcurl, but after I execute the cmd "nmake /f Makefile.vc mode=dll MACHINE=x64" I dont get the build at the Curl directory, \curl\builds\libcurl-vc-x64-release-dll-ipv6-sspi-winssl\bin  but instead I get the directory "curl\builds\libcurl-vc-x64-release-dll-ipv6-sspi-schannel" and then when trying to build the miner nothing happens.

I'm a newbie to mining ERG..  I mostly mine ETH in mining pools.  I like the Idea of having my own node, but I'm thinking it might be too hard for me to understand how to actually mine ERG without a mining pool.  Thanks for your help


[02/08/2021 7:04 PM] Robert K#0722
Mining without a pool will be challenging unless you have a very large hashrate


[02/08/2021 7:04 PM] Robert K#0722
Using pools is also easier to setup, so best stick with that until you poke around and get used to the ergo node for now

[02/08/2021 7:20 PM] Robert K#0722
You don't have to, but yeah you can set it to false. Syncing should take 3-4 hours max if you have a good internet connection and not the worst cpu on earth.


[02/08/2021 7:20 PM] Robert K#0722
In your terminal does it show you are syncing? (Does it update the block height)

You are using private key of another coin. Make sure you are using only the private key of your ergo wallet


[02/08/2021 9:22 PM] xfly (œÉ, œÉ)#5520
it is


[02/08/2021 9:23 PM] xfly (œÉ, œÉ)#5520
it is the file from the magnum wallet


[02/08/2021 9:23 PM] xfly (œÉ, œÉ)#5520
Wallet: Ergo (ERG)


[02/08/2021 9:23 PM] xfly (œÉ, œÉ)#5520
then the adress followed by the pk and the Mnemonic

[02/10/2021 2:32 PM] Robert K#0722
Sounds like something broke. Maybe the history got corrupted if you shut it off abruptly by mistake?


[02/10/2021 2:32 PM] Robert K#0722
Try syncing a node from 0 once again (make sure you have your mnemonic saved and handy before deleting anything)


[02/10/2021 2:33 PM] Robert K#0722
Or as I said previously, you can just use Yoroi alternatively to get a working wallet without much extra work


[02/10/2021 4:42 PM] PA-Joe#6163
I was able to restore my wallet to a Yoroi ERG wallet.  Thanks.  It's showing the correct amount of ERG in the Yoroi wallet.  I should be good to go to delete my ergo folder and start over?  Well, not delete, I will just rename the old ergo folder in case I need a file later?


[02/10/2021 4:54 PM] Robert K#0722
Yes you should be fine with deleting/renaming.


[02/10/2021 4:54 PM] Robert K#0722
Your funds are safe as long as you have your mnemonic.

Not sure if I've done something daft, I was liquidating some shtcoins into erg and went to withdraw - got the address from yoroi-web and withdrew via Hotbit. It didnt appear so I assumed it'd maybe just take a few hours due to the difficulty. 

The withdrawal is now showing as complete on Hotbit, but when I go to Yoroi mobile, that address isn't there, I have a `9fp...` and a `9em...` but no `9ehe...` - I've double checked my CoinEx and Hotbit logs, is there anywhere else I could've sent it? It's not in any of my erg wallets and that's the only two exchanges I'm on that take erg 

Address: 9ehaY3eBJLUqQAeCfzsPhWVHJ1KFoSGLP86FSzS4yPhZgDeXN4s

Txid: 49ea3fa520fb3a6cdc9ab536910aa2c5cbb91354e455f469a5b28589a57df9d5

You should be able to find your ergo.log and send that to kushti as he mentioned


[02/11/2021 3:42 PM] Robert K#0722
Your node is acting a bit odd and we need logs to figure out what's wrong


[02/11/2021 3:44 PM] Robert K#0722
That is pretty unfortunate @glasgowm. Not sure if there's really anything that is possible to do at this point if they were somehow sent to the wrong address.


[02/11/2021 3:44 PM] Robert K#0722
Maybe asking Hotbit support if you didn't enter that address and have no idea what it is?


[02/11/2021 3:52 PM] glasgowm#9381
Found them! I had accidentally sent them to my friend. Don't know how I manage it

not sure directories in config are corresponding to windows format. Are you getting "Bad API Key" error when unlocking API in 127.0.0.1:9053/panel maybe ?


[02/11/2021 6:05 PM] PA-Joe#6163
No, API key works fine.  No Errors.


[02/11/2021 6:07 PM] PA-Joe#6163
The folder structure is there in windows. The key is in the folder listed in the config file. It was incrementing fine and then just stopped. This is the second time too. Although this time it got further.  Hmmm, 3rd times a charm? üòÜ

hello all -- I've created my first Ergo wallet in Yoroi and sent 10 ERG to it from CoinEx... CoinEx says the tx is complete, the tx currently has 80 confirmations, my receiving address on the explorer says it has the 10 ERG in it, but Yoroi says zero and no transactions... I've re-synced several times, and even removed and restored my wallet (and re-verified my receiving address is still the same, etc...) -- any help would be appreciated...

[02/19/2021 6:48 AM] anon_real#2768
A pop-up comes in asking you to send some amount to an address


[02/19/2021 6:48 AM] anon_real#2768
After you do that, your NFT will be issued

How To Issue an Artwork NFT Auction - Ergo Blockchain
In this video we take you step-by-step through how to create an Artwork NFT using https://ergoutils.org and then auctioning it off on the Ergo Auction House https://ergoauctions.org/.

[02/19/2021 7:10 AM] anon_real#2768
If any questions remained, let me know


[02/19/2021 7:35 AM] anon_real#2768
Hmm, you have two options:
- create the NFT again based on the procedure and ignore the first one
- You can start the auction with your yoroi wallet. So yoroi sends tokens around with 0.01 ERG. In the auction house, you have to set the initial bid in a way that the final amount that it asks you to send along with NFT would be 0.01 ERG


[02/19/2021 7:35 AM] anon_real#2768
Does the second approach makes sense to you?


[02/19/2021 7:36 AM] anon_real#2768
Ah, initial bid must be at least 0.1 ERG )


[02/19/2021 7:38 AM] anon_real#2768
So what you have to do is to send two transactions. let's say you set initial bid to 1 ERG then you first have to send your NFT to the provided address (which contains also 0.01 ERG) and send another transaction to fill the remaining ERGs which would be 1.001 in case of 1 ERG initial bid.


[02/19/2021 8:29 AM] anon_real#2768
So what was your initial bid? and how much did you send in the second tx?


[02/19/2021 8:31 AM] anon_real#2768
Yes, a looot of txs in mempool.


[02/19/2021 8:31 AM] anon_real#2768
You should have sent 5.001 in second tx since 0.01 was sent with you NFT


[02/19/2021 8:31 AM] anon_real#2768
So the sum would be 5.002


[02/19/2021 8:32 AM] anon_real#2768
So you should wait for your funds to be returned to you (


[02/19/2021 8:33 AM] anon_real#2768
No problem.


[02/19/2021 8:33 AM] anon_real#2768
Sorry I was wrong. So if you want 5 ERG as initial bid, send 4.992 ERG in second tx (5.002 - 0.01)

[02/19/2021 12:25 PM] anon_real#2768

hi there! i got my node ver 4.0.7 running and synced, but my wallet was showing less balance than it was supposed to show, so i did via swagger a wallet rescan, now the wallet says "active synchronization" but it's like 24 hours and wallet shows 0 balance, should i remove wallet directory or...


[02/20/2021 12:22 PM] ponte#8953
ups sorry just noticed that node says synced but it's not on the same height


[02/20/2021 12:22 PM] ponte#8953
i'll try to reverse to 4.0.4


[02/20/2021 12:27 PM] ponte#8953
yeah, so 4.0.4 show "synced" state but it's on the wrong height... what do you suggest? full resync? üò≠


[02/20/2021 1:19 PM] anon_real#2768
My nodes had this issue this morning too


[02/20/2021 1:20 PM] anon_real#2768
I had no chance but to resync (


[02/20/2021 1:21 PM] ponte#8953
@anon_real  will do that, thanks!


[02/20/2021 1:53 PM] ponte#8953
Now I started to sync node but my wallet address is different from the one I got before... Did it couple of times to be sure I restored the wallet with correct mnemonic...


[02/20/2021 1:53 PM] ponte#8953
I deleted whole .ergo folder


[02/20/2021 1:55 PM] ponte#8953
Well I renamed it. Than I tried to put Wallet folder into the new .ergo folder created by the node but the address shown it's still different from the original one


[02/20/2021 2:31 PM] anon_real#2768
I think your address (wallet folder) was created before 3.3.4
Maybe try to add ```ergo.wallet.usePreEip3Derivation = true``` to your config file (after removing wallet again) and run the node.


[02/20/2021 2:33 PM] ponte#8953
I managed to have addresses back putting back the whole folder, renamed just state and history folder and restarting the node


[02/20/2021 2:34 PM] ponte#8953
Yes, it's surely before 3.3.4 ... Next time will try preEip3derivation or maybe if I don't see balance after resync )

They are pending. I am told to send more tokens to help speed up the process, I send 2 more ergo, they arrive, but nothing happens. If I send the total amount pending 251, the process begins but the same amount remains in the mixer. A never ending loop.

@petabyteHD  @MiV  I don't know if not having an API key worked in earlier versions, but I know that 4.0.7 gave me a lot of issues when doing that (I imagine people who upgraded already had the API key so it isn't mentioned  as much).

I used https://toolkitbay.com/tkb/tool/BLAKE2b_256 (credits to @kushti ) to generate a string,hash(string) to be able to create an API key.

You probably could go with a version like 4.0.4, but it'd be annoying to update if you can just generate key the aforementioned way.

I've had the transaction fail and had to try again multiple times. I think it happens if the price of ERG changes but I'm not sure.


[02/28/2021 10:01 AM] KushGene#1429
Hey üôÇ
Im using sigmausd.io and had bought some SigRSV with ERG yesterday. So lets say the amount was 1000. Now I bought some more SigRSV with ERG, lets say 500. So my new RSV balance should be 1500 or not?

The problem is, that my balance only shows the 500 (switched from the 1000 to 500). I believe its a virtual bug, but just want to mention and to be sure, that it is only a bug ^^


[02/28/2021 10:03 AM] anon_real#2768
@KushGene Maybe they are in different addresses. UI only shows for the address you have set for your wallet.


[02/28/2021 10:04 AM] KushGene#1429
The thing is, that the wallet showed the first amount all the time. I didnt changed the wallet, just bought new and now the new balance is showed instead of old+new.

Also, the purchase history is still there showing the right things (2 txs)


[02/28/2021 10:04 AM] anon_real#2768
@KushGene Yoroi can potentially move your tokens to other change addresses.


[02/28/2021 10:05 AM] KushGene#1429
Just checked the receiver address on both the RSV txs, both wallet adresses are the same.

I gave it 4 cores to run on, because it was not liking 2 cores while synching


[03/01/2021 3:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
That might explain why my node VM crashes. Only allocated 4GB of ram, and 4 cores. The node crashes after a bit.

is tx in the mempool or what ?


[03/01/2021 11:19 AM] ponte#8953
Hello all, I tried to buy either sigUSD and sigRSV and it went smooth. Now I don't want to have USD instead of ergs or RSV so I tried to redeem my USD but transaction in sigmausd.io shows "pending" since more than half an hour. When I click the transaction it shows that it's not in the mempool yet but in yoroi I can see the transaction happened


[03/01/2021 11:21 AM] ponte#8953
tx id is: 1d368b0b72cf540413fbedd2b986ae85ef692e59f7ca63c7fc01f3298492c393  (from yoroi)


[03/01/2021 11:37 AM] ponte#8953
transaction from sigmausd.io is:  fab343af25e529b265615ae0351e706f4d1c654587977dd6133de4fbe389d360


[03/01/2021 11:41 AM] anon_real#2768
@ponte Something unexpected has happened. Assembler will return your funds in a few hours when these kinds of rare things happen.
No need to wait for assembler to send refund though. You can use the following url to make asembler send your refund anytime your want (can even work if you want to cancel your request before it is done):
```https://assm.sigmausd.io/return/user_address_set_in_ui/address_funds_sent_to```


[03/01/2021 11:41 AM] anon_real#2768
Please let me know in DM if you have difficulties using the url


[03/01/2021 11:43 AM] ponte#8953
thanks anon_real! do i understand well: user address is my yoroi address set in the sigmausd.io page


[03/01/2021 11:44 AM] anon_real#2768
yes because refund can only be sent to that address


[03/01/2021 11:44 AM] ponte#8953
address funds set to is the address generated by sigmausd.io to send usd from yoroi, right?


[03/01/2021 11:44 AM] anon_real#2768
right


[03/01/2021 11:45 AM] ponte#8953

[03/01/2021 4:57 PM] Kardall#4142
Ya we are contemplating running a miner on a server we run two other applications on. But i'm not sure it's a good idea. It has a 1070 on it, so it would work. I just wanted to figure out if there was a way to modify the miner for nVidia to limit the GPU usage to like 80% maybe.


[03/01/2021 4:58 PM] Kardall#4142
Unfortunately I don't have an nVidia GPU myself, so I can't test it

I did see that the AMD one has loglevel support somehow, but it's not really clear how to enable it in the config.


[03/01/2021 5:00 PM] Kardall#4142
My next step is to try to build the node from scratch, and see if I can work on that to get it so I can change the way it logs myself.


[03/01/2021 5:00 PM] Kardall#4142
Having a 1.3gb log file is annoying

Yeah, I considered seeing if Linux handled the miner any differently, on a dedicated machine. I liked the idea of running a node on a raspberry pie though, for efficiency purposes

That's why my friend wants to do.


[03/01/2021 5:15 PM] Kardall#4142
He'd rather buy $1000 worth of pi's and run it that way.

Just make a cluster node. Doubt 1000 dollars worth of pi‚Äôs would pay for itself quickly enough to justify the process

I feel ya. The increased cost of GPU‚Äôs sorta makes me happy that I‚Äôve hoarded the handful of GPU‚Äôs I have laying around. Need to try one more time to revive this other 580 ive got. I don‚Äôt have high hopes for it though

[03/03/2021 11:09 PM] kushti#0978
@wunderbaer [Hermes Stakepool] this config is rewriting some values from reference.conf (in the same folder), and there're comments there


[03/03/2021 11:22 PM] kushti#0978
Guys I've realized that some of you are running nodes (on Windows , following some tutorial, I guess) with directory = "c:/ergo" and secretDir = "c:/ergo" , and then wallet is not initialized after restart.

The problem is that the node assumes that the secret dir contains only one file (encrypted seed). Likely you have many JSON files in the secretDir folder. 
4.0.8 will be permissive to multiple files in secretDir. For versions we have now, copy JSON file(any of them if you used the same mnemonic) to a dedicated secretDir containing one JSON file only!

Please DM me your wallet address to send refund

I tried to redeem my SigRSV using the Ergo node interface.  I sent the SigmaRSV using the "Assets" checkbox on the wallet but now I'm showing 0 balance for SigmaRSV in my account and no Erg to replace it?  Is there some sort of lag I should be aware of?


[03/05/2021 1:35 PM] Rich#6507
I believe this is the transaction, but I can't figure out how to tell where the SigmaRSV was attached: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/8febfa55c5243bfbc21d3f51156a20c0e38ce82ec0bdf8aec490afde35c8ef5f

@Rich You should have set 0..01 ERG for the asset. You have sent it with 0.001 ERG

Not sure if anyone has seen the message in the #deleted-channel channel but there are a few people over on Telegram starting to get anxious as well about transactions seeming to be frozen from the perspective of the Explorer. Just wanted to bring it up here for visibility.

@$aX do you run it with -Xmx flag ?

e.g. java -jar -Xmx3G  ergo-4.0.8.jar  --mainnet -c mainnet.conf

please do that

@kushti I have plenty of memory available, but I can try that


[03/25/2021 6:33 PM] kushti#0978
@$aX it's JVM garbage collector issue on some platforms, please try the flag


[03/25/2021 6:40 PM] $aX#5658
@kushti It appears to have solved the issue, thank you!


[03/25/2021 6:40 PM] $aX#5658
Would it be worth trying -Xmx4G on an 8GB RAM system?


[03/25/2021 6:41 PM] $aX#5658
Or would there be no improvement in sync time with that


[03/25/2021 8:14 PM] kidamoianlicci#1768

[03/26/2021 4:32 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
The auction house doesn‚Äôt need to connect to your wallet, because you enter your wallet address in the auction house ‚ÄúConfigure Wallet‚Äù pop up, and then have to send money from that wallet to confirm your bids; so any ergo wallet should work, including Yoroi...
That said, there‚Äôs not many right now...(see photo)

[03/29/2021 10:06 PM] cymatic#8185
So the transaction looks like it was successful? Do you see it showing as successful on the "History" area of the sigmausd.io page?


[03/29/2021 10:08 PM] viler#2164
This is try after that. First was 100k SigRSV

Did you send to node wallet or Yoroi?


[03/29/2021 10:24 PM] viler#2164
I sent from Yoroi to generated adress from https://sigmausd.io/#/reservecoin. Second time i try just 6ERG and it work but somehow first 117 sent "somewhere"


[03/29/2021 10:29 PM] cymatic#8185
So the ERGs are missing from Yoroi, the history on sigmausd.io is showing as green, but you don't see the SigRSV in the "Select asset" dropdown on the "Send" tab of your Yoroi wallet?


[03/29/2021 10:32 PM] viler#2164
Nop there is no history on sigmausd.io about this transfer and ERGS are missing in yoroi


[03/29/2021 10:35 PM] cymatic#8185
And you know the address you sent your ERGs to is correct as you "copied" it from the sigmausd.io site? (by clicking the link that places the address on your clipboard)


[03/29/2021 10:35 PM] viler#2164
Yes Im 100% sure that i did it right.


[03/29/2021 10:37 PM] cymatic#8185
Okay, it currently only has 48 confirmations...might just need to wait until it has "high" level of confirmation to see the Tx fully completed. But I can't guarantee that. If I remember correctly, it seemed like once I got above 200-250 confirmations that my Tx's were "final"


[03/29/2021 11:02 PM] viler#2164
So its solved, probably im good

wallets are the basis for every interaction. Please don't use just one server for important apps. 

Try using decentralized Servers that cannot go down due to high usage or be hacked/ddos. maybe just 0.1% of cryptoland knows Ergo. And yet you have such problems.What happens after you become a big name?

 Try Prepare now for later.
You are building all decentralized stuff but when it comes to core internet you stick with centralized inefficient models.

The Internet makes everything work, if internet connections get bad, everything else fails.  

There are already products that decentralize websites,apps,cloud,servers,DNS.

Look into services like **twitter.com/Syntropynet**  to never experience server slow downs or app outages

Or look at FLUX as decentralized server alternative for running apps, **twitter.com/RunOnFlux**

These decentralized services are also **cheaper**. So business wise nice benefit. Work with your blockchain peers. Take this hint not just for your wallets but for any of your app infrastructure:D  @Sebastien

[04/14/2021 3:24 AM] JKleinne#7947
I‚Äôm hoping someone can help me recover my SigmaRSV. I made a redeeming attempt and was instructed to send SigmaRSV to a specified long address. I sent it from the Ergo node wallet, and I have yet to receive my ERGs back. Furthermore, the sigmausd.io UI does not show the redemption in its history, and the SigRSVs are gone. Would really appreciate any help right now, thanks


[04/14/2021 3:39 AM] JKleinne#7947
I think I see why, SigRSV redeem addresses start with yWW, I think I sent SigRSV to the SigUSD redeem address


[04/14/2021 3:39 AM] JKleinne#7947
Is there any way I can recover it?


[04/14/2021 3:51 AM] Dergler#0451
couple things to check, when did you try doing this? the current sigmausd.io is new contract, so check the v1 contract by scrolling to bottom and clicking v1. your wallet's history only shows for the connected wallet, is there a chance that you switched public addresses that you were using?


[04/14/2021 3:54 AM] JKleinne#7947
Tried it not almost an hour ago and I‚Äôm positive it‚Äôs the V2 contract and it also has the correct wallet address. I have the address and the transaction that took place, but I realized I sent SigRSV to a SigUSD redemption address. I can see the SigRSV still within that address however, I was hoping for a transaction refund like what happens when minting fails but so far nothing yet


[04/14/2021 3:55 AM] JKleinne#7947
Also tried https://assm.sigmausd.io/return/your_address_set_in_ui/the_long_address_you_sent_to


[04/14/2021 3:55 AM] JKleinne#7947
but would respond `requirement failed: Minimal ERG value not met`


[04/14/2021 4:04 AM] Dergler#0451

[04/14/2021 10:25 PM] JKleinne#7947
it's solved, thanks to Glasgow and anon. I sent SigRSV to proxy with node, so I was sending 0.001 instead of 0.01 so I couldn't get the refund. I sent some ERG a few times to the address but would instantly get returned to me giving me no window to execute https://assm.sigmausd.io/return/your_address_set_in_ui/the_long_address_you_sent_to . After a few more tries sending 0.01 ERG to the proxy address, I was able to get the refund

{Reactions}
üëç 

[04/14/2021 10:30 PM] JKleinne#7947
Basically, the address didn't have enough balance in ERG (the one I initially sent was 0.001 ERG) to create a transaction to return my SigRSV and it was not retaining any ERG I sent but was returning them immediately. For some reason, it did retain the latest send and I was able to initiate the refund


[04/15/2021 4:40 PM] glasgowm#9381
anon has ping dimitry to fix, but in the meantime ^

Hi guys. When I want to use SRBminer I need to specify my Worker name


[04/18/2021 5:10 PM] eMBe#4363
what's worker name pointing at ?


[04/18/2021 5:13 PM] eMBe#4363
is it just my rig name ?

I replied to my support ticket again & they asked for all the info I had already provided again so I dunno, exactly the reason I want this in my wallet instead of relying on such amateurism

SigmaUSD.io is showing incorrect balances for me after a couple failed transactions. History is correct but "your balance" and the banner up top values are incorrect. What really matters is what Yoroi shows after confirmation, right?


[04/20/2021 9:47 PM] glasgowm#9381
Hm, sure you don't have a different wallet connected? Sigmausd.io should display the SigUSD/RSV of the connected wallet

which version do you have ?


[04/21/2021 1:13 PM] kushti#0978

Hi guys, Im new to Ergo and am trying to understand it more, but I notice it is quite technical for me. So I was wondering: 
- What are you guys most excited about to come to Ergo the coming months?
- Has there been an increase in (unique) developer engagement? Is there a way for me to track such a metric?


[04/23/2021 5:04 PM] glasgowm#9381
- ErgoDEX probably
- Yes - no formal way to track it, you can see how many people kushti has tagged each week in #üõ†‚îÇdevelopment but probably not the most accurate metric

yeah, but we had raspy node with 512 MB RAM given @The Gamerzs

If you set it too low performance on java processes usually degrades.

please run with -Xmx flag, e.g. -Xmx512m , but we haven't tried smaller values, and you need to leave some RAM for OS. Try -Xmx384m maybe

ntroducing SigmaUSD.io the first UTxO-based stable coin - an instantiation of the AgeUSD protocol. The foundation on which a new era of digital finance will be built.

Its economic model designed in partnership between IOHK, Ergo, and Emurgo maintains the conservative settings for collateral reserves and avoids the need for liquidations. Along with that, it supports a fully decentralised stablecoin emission setup. Thus, SigmaUSD will offer the world a stable, simple, and decentralised stablecoin.

use-cases
- Accepted in cryptocurrencycheckout 
- Mix SigUSD or SigRSV in ErgoMixer, the first non-custodial, non-interactive miner in the cryptocurrency space.

Troubleshooting:
Transactions can fail when the oracle refreshes during (and the price changes). In this event the funds will be returned to your connected wallet. 

Use this link for a refund anytime if your funds become 'stuck' in a proxy address:  https://assm.sigmausd.io/return/your_address_set_in_ui/the_long_address_you_sent_to

Notes:
- Do not use "send all assets" option in Yoroi! It will send sigUSD and sigRSV in addition to ERG.
- There is a large stakeholder with SigUSD (the 'Bearwhale') - see the latest updates here - https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-05-13-bearwhale-saga/

Something happened over the night and I started my node set the API key put in the wallet password and boom. Successful with the correct balance unlike before ü§î  so it beyond my comprehension what it was was but I have successfully accessed the wallet . Thank you!


[05/13/2021 7:35 PM] stakeman#4490
@glasgowm thank you for the info. Just one more headsup. What about redeeming. As a test pilot currently it doesnt let me redeem more than 0 based on Reserve status? what does that mean . Thanks in Advance

Does the Airdrop on ergoutils have any requirements or limitations? I can't get it to let me airdrop some tokens


[05/13/2021 11:46 PM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
It's giving the error "Could not contact the assembler service"

Is it possible to create tokens built on Ergo platform like it is on BSC and ERC20 networks?


[05/14/2021 4:33 AM] Kaven#6681
believe so, yes, but i'm not official support


[05/14/2021 4:33 AM] Kaven#6681
google ergoscript github or something like that


[05/14/2021 4:34 AM] Kaven#6681
hey question for anyone that knows, if i'm running a node can i call /wallet/init and create more wallets?


[05/14/2021 4:34 AM] Kaven#6681
basically i want to have a hodling wallet and then one for transactions and what not


[05/14/2021 4:34 AM] Kaven#6681
dont want to be sending out the one that holds the balance


[05/14/2021 6:43 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
I was told you might have some insights about how ergoUtils.orgs' airdrops works? I can't get it to contact the assembler service when I try to use it. 
I read there was some kind of gatekeeping that needed to done for it.. but wasn't sure if that was still the case.

Just for learning purposes: 
- how hard would it be to set up a smart contract and oracle (pool?) that evaluates Covid number and vaccine numbers of different Austrian regions (available as open data series) and that assigns (minimal) amounts of ERG to the virtual wallets of each region (9) based on a weighted indicator? 
- is it possible to set up for a non- tech person like me with only some python knowledge? 
- or would it be more of a ‚Äûleave it to the devs‚Äú thing?
- Thanks in advance

I think there might be some problem with the ERG withdrawal on hotbit side again. I tried to withdraw my ERG from there and it says completed on app and theres a txid but when I check on the txid on the ergo explorer, It doesn't recognize it. It has been a while now.


[05/14/2021 4:37 PM] darkarcz#0603
sent a ticket to hotbit to check as well but they haven't gotten back. A little bit worried of my ERG which is currently stuck in limbo

@anon_real The Airdrop is working again! thank you!

I've never used it before, do I need to send two transactions to the given address if I'm trying to send out a bunch of SFT? 
or can I use Yoroi to add multiple tokens per transaction?... or do I need to do something else... 

If anyone else knows this or has experience with the ErgoUtils Airdrop PLEASE Help!

Hey folks, loving the looks of this project. Is Ergo listed on any swap/exchange tools? For example uniswap?


[05/15/2021 2:48 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
Ergo is currently not listed on a swap. ErgoDex is supposed to launch soon and that would be the gateway


[05/15/2021 2:49 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
currently it's only on a few centralized exchanges


[05/15/2021 2:50 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
CoinEx, Gate.io, Waves.exchange (is that decentralize? haven't used it), Hotbit.io and TradeOrge


[05/15/2021 2:52 AM] Sid#0001
Sounds good, I'll stick to gate.io for now.


[05/15/2021 2:52 AM] Sid#0001
Made an account on there just to buy ergo.


[05/15/2021 2:53 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
It's pretty amazing how much ERGO is growing in price considering how it's not the easiest to acquire for the common investor üôÇ Looking forward to the DEX üôÇ 

Good luck!


[05/15/2021 2:57 AM] Sid#0001
Thank bud, loving this coin so far. Stuck my 800mh/s on it and pulled all my rigs off of ETH. Still holding onto my ETH bag of course, but excited to diversify into something that's so progressive with the tech, and will be a safe haven to miners with 2.0, as well as solves the scalability issues with ETH. And has some ADA magic blended in.


[05/15/2021 3:00 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
üòÑ I was actually doing the math on my ETH rig today üòÑ now that ERG has jumped up, I might also make the swap üòÑ 

ERG is definitely doing it right! for the right reasons! Looking forward to seeing where we can take it from here! üßë‚ÄçüöÄ


[05/15/2021 3:01 AM] Sid#0001
I'm glad I'm in now! Going to see some great gains once 2.0 rolls out, and it gets listed on more exchanges. It's a good hedge to protect current eth holdings.


[05/15/2021 3:08 AM] Sid#0001
I mean, even at current profitability, it's not far off from what I'd be making on Eth. So long as it's not listed on whattomine it should be solid prime time mining.

Gate.io won't let you withdraw until they verify your identity, with your drivers license and whatnot. Still pending my verification. Scared to hold onto almost 2k worth of ergo in there. Prefer it in my own wallet.

that is the zip


[05/16/2021 7:15 PM] andee#4722
have you unzipped it?


[05/16/2021 7:16 PM] aldigidi#7180
yes is that the second image?


[05/16/2021 7:16 PM] aldigidi#7180
or no?


[05/16/2021 7:16 PM] andee#4722
no, its still compressed


[05/16/2021 7:17 PM] aldigidi#7180
how do i unzip?


[05/16/2021 7:17 PM] aldigidi#7180
i thought double clicking


[05/16/2021 7:17 PM] aldigidi#7180
unzips


[05/16/2021 7:17 PM] andee#4722
that only opens the archive


[05/16/2021 7:17 PM] andee#4722
right click the file and uncompress/unzip, whatever


[05/16/2021 7:18 PM] andee#4722
should also be an alternative inside the archive, but you cropped too much of it to see


[05/16/2021 7:18 PM] aldigidi#7180
extract all?


[05/16/2021 7:18 PM] andee#4722
yes

If you hold sigrsv, claim profit. if you only hold erg there is nothing you can help with @Kaven

yes i read once, i'll read again. thank you.


[05/17/2021 12:42 AM] Kaven#6681
andee, do you know if node alone can hold multiple wallets, or do i need to run ergomixer or some other dapp or tool to set up more wallet addresses?


[05/17/2021 12:42 AM] Kaven#6681
basically i need a solution for transacting more privately in public


[05/17/2021 12:42 AM] Kaven#6681
compiling ergomixer now, but wondering if i'm overthinking it


[05/17/2021 12:48 AM] andee#4722
@Kaven I haven't tried the mixer yet, but its whole purpose is to hide the origin of the coins so I am pretty sure you won't need separate wallets. Its on my research list üôÇ


[05/17/2021 12:50 AM] Kaven#6681
yeah i'm just looking for the recommended solution for transacting in public, ergo and custom tokens, in a private way, e.g. multiple wallets


[05/17/2021 12:53 AM] andee#4722
I think the way it works is that you send coins to the mixer, when they are ready to withdraw you just input the address you want them transferred to


[05/17/2021 12:54 AM] andee#4722
no need for a separate wallet. But of course you can use one of your other wallets as output address


[05/17/2021 12:54 AM] Kaven#6681
so i'm less talking about breaking link between my funds and recipient, but more about, i just need transactional wallets that dont hold my entire reserve/balance


[05/17/2021 12:54 AM] Kaven#6681
yeah its the 'one of my other wallets' part i'm wondering about


[05/17/2021 12:54 AM] Kaven#6681
what other wallets?


[05/17/2021 12:54 AM] Kaven#6681
i set up the full node, i get 1 wallet


[05/17/2021 12:54 AM] Kaven#6681
how do i get more


[05/17/2021 12:56 AM] andee#4722
cant you just use yoroi? seems simpler, no?


[05/17/2021 12:57 AM] Kaven#6681
i would, only problem is it apparently cannot accept custom tokens, only ada and erg


[05/17/2021 12:58 AM] Kaven#6681
i mean ideally i could get on the ergo panel and spin up some extra addresses, but i dont see this


[05/17/2021 12:58 AM] Kaven#6681
i see in the swagger ui there is a /wallet/init endpoint but


[05/17/2021 12:58 AM] Kaven#6681
i dont know if this is the answer


[05/17/2021 1:00 AM] andee#4722
keep different config files for the different wallets, run the node with the config of the wallet you want?


[05/17/2021 1:00 AM] Kaven#6681
hmm


[05/17/2021 1:01 AM] Kaven#6681
looking into this..


[05/17/2021 1:02 AM] Kaven#6681
the only configurable value i see in the conf is scorex { restApi { apiKeyHash } }


[05/17/2021 1:02 AM] Kaven#6681
well anyway, i'll look into your suggestion more, thanks


[05/17/2021 1:05 AM] andee#4722
thats a hash of the secret you initialize the wallet with


[05/17/2021 1:05 AM] andee#4722
I don't know if you have to edit any of the others things, if running another config will overwrite something. I haven't setup a node yet, too much on TODO list


[05/17/2021 5:02 AM] SUPERSOLDIER97x#7653
Yeah i've been looking on how to create more addresses but can't seem to figure it out using the node


[05/17/2021 5:14 AM] dns963#4838
hello, how can i redeem old sigrsv?


[05/17/2021 5:32 AM] Kaven#6681

How can I convert my ERG to BTC I want to use p4ay.com to cashout?


[05/17/2021 2:38 PM] $aX#5658
@SUPERSOLDIER97x @Kaven You can create new addresses from the Swagger API within the wallet


[05/17/2021 2:39 PM] $aX#5658
/wallet/deriveNextKey


[05/17/2021 2:46 PM] SUPERSOLDIER97x#7653
I'll try that out


[05/17/2021 2:50 PM] SUPERSOLDIER97x#7653
do i need to be synced for that to work


[05/17/2021 3:00 PM] SUPERSOLDIER97x#7653
I got it work after my node was synced


[05/17/2021 4:30 PM] Kaven#6681

[05/17/2021 4:30 PM] Kaven#6681
i will try this now


[05/17/2021 4:30 PM] Kaven#6681
imo there should be ui controls for this in the panel btw


[05/17/2021 4:32 PM] andee#4722
@Kaven Weren't you after separate wallets, not addresses?


[05/17/2021 4:41 PM] Kaven#6681
whats the diff


[05/17/2021 4:48 PM] andee#4722
separate wallets have different seeds


[05/17/2021 4:48 PM] andee#4722
one wallet can have many addresses


[05/17/2021 4:49 PM] Kaven#6681
can the wallet be derived from the result of 'deriveNextKey' return value


[05/17/2021 4:49 PM] Kaven#6681
my goal is privacy


[05/17/2021 4:57 PM] Kaven#6681
i know daedalus gives you a bunch of keys for your cardano wallet but then warns that the wallet can be derived from these additional keys and not to rely on them for privacy


[05/17/2021 4:59 PM] andee#4722
I would like to know the answer to this aswell


[05/17/2021 4:59 PM] andee#4722
No point in mixing from address 1 to address 2 if its possible to link the addresses to the same wallet


[05/17/2021 5:27 PM] Kaven#6681
@SUPERSOLDIER97x would you happen to know the answer to this?


[05/17/2021 5:27 PM] Kaven#6681
i'll search for documentation on it


[05/17/2021 5:28 PM] Kaven#6681
for how big of a project and community this is, this discord is pretty sleepy :/


[05/17/2021 5:31 PM] andee#4722
they have a lot on the roadmap and limited resources


[05/17/2021 5:44 PM] Kaven#6681
yeah just sayin'


[05/17/2021 5:44 PM] Kaven#6681
it is what it is


[05/17/2021 6:03 PM] SUPERSOLDIER97x#7653
what was your  question


[05/17/2021 6:05 PM] Kaven#6681
alright so say i run a full node. i get a wallet with that. now i want to transact in public without flashing my wallet/full balance around. if i call /wallet/deriveNextKey my understanding is this isnt a separate wallet per se, but another hash that points to the same wallet. would this hash be private? or could a 3rd party derive my wallet from it? the latter is the case with daedalus/cardano which warns you the additional keys are not private and wallet can be derived from them.


[05/17/2021 6:08 PM] SUPERSOLDIER97x#7653
as I understand it address generation is supposed to be a one way process. You can still track that address but not any others generated by the same key


[05/17/2021 6:08 PM] SUPERSOLDIER97x#7653
otherwise people could not only track your entire balance but also steal your funds


[05/17/2021 6:08 PM] Kaven#6681
its kind of an important topic. i think users would like to know their main wallet is private like they know their bank account is private. i need to find some documentation on this, but i'm not seeing any.


[05/17/2021 6:09 PM] Kaven#6681
if anyone from ergo team devs/ergonauts could chime in that would be helpful


[05/17/2021 6:15 PM] SUPERSOLDIER97x#7653
its important to remember that this is a public blockchain


[05/17/2021 6:23 PM] andee#4722
@SUPERSOLDIER97x Cardano addresses are possible to link to each other, to know that they belong to the same wallet even though they have never transferred funds between each other, that's the question


[05/17/2021 6:24 PM] andee#4722
if it is possible to do the same with ergo, because then it would be useless to mix from address 1 in wallet to address 2, since they can be linked just by knowing the addresses


[05/17/2021 6:25 PM] andee#4722
then would have to create a new wallet to mix the coins to, so the addresses are not possible to link to wallet 1


[05/17/2021 6:25 PM] SUPERSOLDIER97x#7653
I think that this would require an answer from the devs


[05/17/2021 6:30 PM] Kaven#6681
okay. so with the privacy-enabling features of ergo being a major highlight of the platform, we should put any documentation on using those features at the forefront. people are flocking to ergo NOW and are going to want to start using it. as a user, i would like to know how addresses/wallets are related such that i can maintain a reasonable level of privacy when transacting in public. thanks.


[05/17/2021 6:31 PM] andee#4722
@anon2020s  seems knowledgeable and active, though idle now üò¶


[05/17/2021 6:31 PM] SUPERSOLDIER97x#7653
I agree. Its also important to note that the mixer was created by someone who is not affiliated with the foundation


[05/17/2021 6:33 PM] andee#4722

i get the bad API key even tho i have
-so far carefully followed the github page on "Set up a full node"
-used the swagger ui with multiple "secrets" to get the hash, that have been pasted in ergo.conf
-wrote the "secret" on the panel set api with and without quotes multiple times
my ergo.conf looks like the one in the screenshot (hash replaced by placeholder for obvious reason)

And do the pools basically end up with more or less the same profit.

Hey Ergo team, I am a video maker, crypto investor and Cardano bull. I just recently saw your video competition on Youtube.... is there any way you can extend the deadline and I will make a kick ass video explaining everything about Ergo. For a look at some of my previous videos check out my YT channel - The Daily Millennial. I've made some on blockchain and Charles Hoskinson previously.

@RuruPT I seriously doubt that they are willing to pay binance for a listing


[05/18/2021 1:36 PM] RuruPT#2996
binance would increase coin value


[05/18/2021 1:40 PM] andee#4722
and so will other listings


[05/18/2021 1:42 PM] andee#4722
they are trying to make a great product, not pump the price


[05/18/2021 1:42 PM] andee#4722
price increases now, without binance


[05/18/2021 2:24 PM] RuruPT#2996
It's not about pumping price, it's about getting in reach to everyone. Me personally, i don't know those exchanges as i've only entrusted binance as my exchange.

[05/19/2021 9:03 AM] glasgowm#9381
Looks like it makes a new wallet - more if you search for `deriveNextKey`


[05/19/2021 9:03 AM] glasgowm#9381
Their deposits have been slow/patchy the past few days.


[05/19/2021 9:05 AM] carlin#9836
So long as it goes through. They upped their ADA withdrawal limit to 500 and now this. I'm surely calling quits on CoinEx now.

Hi all. I have a friend who was mining Ergo for a while, and Yoroi broke under so much small inputs. Unfortunately, he does not have mnemonics, but we extracted private key. 
How can we access funds (that is not via Yoroi), with private key (no mnemonics) at hand?

Hey, how long does it take to recieve Ergo in my yoroi wallet. I have been mining for couple hours now

@glasgowm so /wallet/deriveNextKey just generates more wallets for the same node? are these public keys linked in anyway? like could a third party derive the other wallets using it, or if they had 2 public keys could they verify they're from the same node or that they are linked?

@Forsaken pools normally have a minimum payout, perhaps something like that?


[05/20/2021 12:39 PM] ominous.shark#8410
my hash and my secret match perfectly in Swagger. When I go to "set API key" I get "bad API key" the hash in my config file is the same as the output hash from Swagger.


[05/20/2021 12:40 PM] ominous.shark#8410
@Deleted User does my node need to be fully synced before I can enter my API key to get in?

but when I hit the blue button "Set API key" under http://127.0.0.1:9053/panel/ it says "bad API key"

[05/20/2021 12:52 PM] ominous.shark#8410

[05/20/2021 12:52 PM] andee#4722
and you have restarted the node?


[05/20/2021 12:52 PM] ominous.shark#8410
yes.


[05/20/2021 12:52 PM] ominous.shark#8410
my secret is a string and not just one word. Might that be a problem?


[05/20/2021 12:53 PM] andee#4722
maybe. I have no spaces in my secret


[05/20/2021 12:53 PM] Busata#9432
@Forsaken try the #‚õè‚îÇmining channel perhaps, people discuss configs/setups there


[05/20/2021 12:53 PM] andee#4722
try 'this is my secret'


[05/20/2021 12:53 PM] andee#4722
when authenticating


[05/20/2021 12:54 PM] ominous.shark#8410
Also, if I authorize Swagger, can I change the secret, get the new hash, download the .json can I change it?


[05/20/2021 12:54 PM] ominous.shark#8410
Under Swagger or my node Panel?


[05/20/2021 12:55 PM] ominous.shark#8410
When I type 'this is my secret' in Swagger, it seems to unlock it..... weird


[05/20/2021 12:55 PM] andee#4722
node panel, you said it worked in swagger


[05/20/2021 12:55 PM] ominous.shark#8410
'this is my secret' does not work in node panel. I still get "bad api key"


[05/20/2021 12:56 PM] andee#4722
hash secret, change in config, restart


[05/20/2021 12:56 PM] ominous.shark#8410
do I need to download the json and store the new one in directory/wallet/keystore


[05/20/2021 12:57 PM] andee#4722
what json are you talking about?


[05/20/2021 12:58 PM] andee#4722
```ergo {
    directory = ${ergo.directory}"/.ergo"
    node {
        mining = false
    }
    wallet.secretStorage.secretDir = ${ergo.directory}"/wallet/keystore"
}


scorex {
    restApi {
        # Hex-encoded Blake2b256 hash of an API key. 
        # Should be 64-chars long Base16 string.
        # below is the hash of the string 'hello'
        # replace with your actual hash 
        apiKeyHash = "secret_hash"
    }
}
```


[05/20/2021 12:58 PM] andee#4722
my config


[05/20/2021 12:59 PM] ominous.shark#8410
maybe I'm mistaken, but in /wallet/keystore there is a .json file. Beside the computed hash on Swagger there is a button that says "download" and it downloads a .json and I thought maybe there was a connection between these files. Maybe I'm mistaken.


[05/20/2021 12:59 PM] ominous.shark#8410
also under apiKeyHash = I need to keep my hash in quotes, correct?


[05/20/2021 12:59 PM] andee#4722
yes


[05/20/2021 1:00 PM] andee#4722
you only have a option to download the response, which will be your hashed secret


[05/20/2021 1:00 PM] andee#4722
when you see and think something, just try it and look at the result


[05/20/2021 1:01 PM] ominous.shark#8410
okay. before I try this, one last question. After I start the .jar file to run the node and then open Swagger, do I need to click the authorize button with the lock icon to actually change my secret and the computed hash? or no?


[05/20/2021 1:03 PM] andee#4722
you change the secret in the config file


[05/20/2021 1:03 PM] andee#4722
did you read the guide?


[05/20/2021 1:04 PM] ominous.shark#8410

[05/20/2021 1:04 PM] ominous.shark#8410

[05/20/2021 1:05 PM] andee#4722

‚òùÔ∏è


[05/20/2021 1:06 PM] andee#4722
or just change config and start, if its already stopped


[05/20/2021 1:06 PM] andee#4722
there is no API call to change the secret as far as I know

[05/20/2021 1:11 PM] ominous.shark#8410
I didn't create a new wallet or anything when I changed the secret an the hash (seems like a dumb question, but I gotta ask anyway üòõ )


[05/20/2021 1:12 PM] andee#4722
you need to sync


[05/20/2021 1:12 PM] andee#4722
and you need to restore your wallet


[05/20/2021 1:12 PM] ominous.shark#8410
restore?


[05/20/2021 1:13 PM] ominous.shark#8410
is there a guide for that?


[05/20/2021 1:13 PM] andee#4722
it doesnt restore your wallet by just setting up a node, you need to input your seed


[05/20/2021 1:13 PM] ominous.shark#8410
right. I got the seed. i've recall doing that in the past. I can do that.


[05/20/2021 1:14 PM] ominous.shark#8410
I might just use Yoroi when this is done syncing. I might be in over my head as it were.


[05/20/2021 1:14 PM] andee#4722
you dont need a synced node for running yoroi


[05/20/2021 1:15 PM] ominous.shark#8410
exactly. Then I won't need to run the node. Unless that strengthens the network.


[05/20/2021 1:16 PM] ominous.shark#8410
also, when I successfully set my new api key, there was no button for "initialize wallet" just "unlock" wallet. Does that mean I don't need to restore?


[05/20/2021 1:29 PM] andee#4722
you need to use swagger


[05/20/2021 1:33 PM] ominous.shark#8410
how do I restore the wallet in swagger (I'll once again inquire after a guide)


[05/20/2021 1:36 PM] ominous.shark#8410
I'm in Swagger. Looking under POST /wallet/restore

There are three parameters that need to be passed. "pass", "mnemonic" and "mnemonicPass". What is this mnemonicPass? Do I leave spaces between the mnemonic words?


[05/20/2021 1:36 PM] andee#4722
@ominous.shark I have only used swagger for stuff, as I don't see a reason for using the node wallet other than programmability

[05/20/2021 1:39 PM] ominous.shark#8410
Yeah, I set a password


[05/20/2021 1:40 PM] andee#4722
so you made a new wallet, but did not input your seed?


[05/20/2021 1:41 PM] ominous.shark#8410
well I made the wallet and initialized it when I originally set up the Node


[05/20/2021 1:42 PM] andee#4722
well, then just unlock your wallet and wait for sync?


[05/20/2021 1:42 PM] ominous.shark#8410
I guess so.


[05/20/2021 1:42 PM] andee#4722
You could have said you already had the wallet files


[05/20/2021 1:43 PM] ominous.shark#8410
It just weirded me out that going from 4.0.9 to 4.0.10 would make my wallet balance go back to 0


[05/20/2021 1:44 PM] ominous.shark#8410
You're right. I just wasn't sure if changing my secret and the new hash would effect the wallet I had when I set this node up months ago.


[05/20/2021 1:46 PM] ominous.shark#8410
My main problem was that (I'm using Chrome) I had used a string of words for my secret and Chrome was storing it and I'd just have to single click the field when I opened the "Set API key" window and it would auto fill the secret. But somehow cookies got deleted and I had forgotten the secret.


[05/20/2021 1:47 PM] ominous.shark#8410
I then remembered I had written down the secret phrase. I then used Swagger to confirm that my secret phrase output the correct hash - which it did. But then I kept getting "bad API key" so then you guided me to reset it and that worked.


[05/20/2021 2:04 PM] andee#4722

Hi @Armeanio , thanks again a lot with your support on BitMart. ERG withdrawals/deposits were disabled without notice for about three weeks now.

[05/21/2021 4:51 PM] Tolstojevski#7462
My colleague asked a question a few days ago, figure we should provide more details and hopefully someone can push us in the right direction üôÇ I have a client that mined ergo for a while and his wallet, Yoroi, broke. Unfortunately, no mnemonics. Fortunately, I've managed to extract and decrypt the master extended key. 4 bytes for network, all the depth data (all zeros as they should be), 32 bytes for the chain and 32 for the value, untouched üôÇ . As I did not know a lot about ergo before, took it as a good chance to learn, wrote some code that produces derivate keys and all that, but I'm still at a loss as to how to recover the funds. My two planned approaches ATM are figuring out how the ergo node wallet keystore encrypts the secret and just force feeding it my key after generating a dummy wallet, that or somehow just using the api (perhaps /wallet/transaction/send ) to make the transaction manually as I've the key to sign it with. Just that everything seems to demand mnemonics, and those we do not have :/. Thanks you for reading all of this üôÇ even under these dire circumstances it's nice to learn about ergo, think I will keep working on it, lovely platform.

If i got this right i'd get ERG in average-over-time but can this be calculated. I mean can it be year, day, month scale i get something mined, my hashrate is 45 atm. Wallet and node is synced. Is worker name necessary after wallet password in NBminer exec? I had made an api key as "hello" by mistake due the video wasn't 100% clear, so i remade the ERGO folder again(saved old ergo folder, it's 7,5g large, does it have use in future or should i just delete it)


[05/21/2021 7:38 PM] andee#4722
@Att1Tude just use yoroi, if your'e a noob, don't use the node wallet


[05/21/2021 7:40 PM] Att1Tude#4721

[05/22/2021 3:08 AM] MoistyRoss#0456
because my real ip address doesnt work


[05/22/2021 4:24 AM] nitram147#5106
I would probably take another way -> convert recovered key back to mnemonics and use the seed in new instance of yoroi wallet üôÇ


[05/22/2021 4:26 AM] nitram147#5106
But it depends on which key you had recovered. In case you recovered derived key (after derivation from prior entropy using bip39), it wouldn't be possible


[05/22/2021 4:27 AM] nitram147#5106
But it still should be possible to make another yoroi instance and insert the key there üôÇ


[05/22/2021 4:28 AM] nitram147#5106
(Same way as you did when you where recovering it)


[05/22/2021 6:08 AM] Att1Tude#4721
Ok mined overnight and Yoroi shows 0.0000, can this be right, does it have delay?


[05/22/2021 6:18 AM] Snax#3268
You probably mined less than the threshold for your pool.


[05/22/2021 6:18 AM] Snax#3268
See if that's the problem. You might be able to decrease it, or just wait for it to be reached.


[05/22/2021 6:50 AM] io8126#2322
Has anyone received ergo on coinex in the last couple of days? Two tx with hundreds of confirmations, open ticket, no response for more than 48 hours.

[05/22/2021 8:13 AM] Snax#3268
you need to have mined at least 1 ERG for it to automatically withdraw

it might be higher by default

With my machine mining in the background (I have a 1070) I get about 45.79 MH/s. It will take me about 5 days to mine 1 ERG


[05/22/2021 8:15 AM] Att1Tude#4721
0.03 atm, so few days


[05/22/2021 8:16 AM] Att1Tude#4721
I have similar hashrates. Noticed yesterday i lowered my CPU OC and got 2 H/s more

Well the ERGO node/wallet is still a misery to me. 
I was trying really hard to find out how to get more addresses. 

Not related to my try to get an answer I installed ErgoMixer and connected it yesterday. And now my wallet looks like this. +6 addresses
Anybody can explain this to me? What do I see and why? 

I did not touch the ErgoMixer yet...

How can I setup a wallet for ERGO


[05/26/2021 7:18 AM] TSNP#1337
And where do you recommend me to store ERGO and to sell it?


[05/26/2021 7:48 AM] Busata#9432
you can use yoroi (browser extension) to create a wallet, and I think in random order the popular exchanges seem to be tradeogre, coinex & gate.io


[05/26/2021 7:49 AM] Busata#9432
and to improve security you could only use yoroi on a device you don't use as daily driver or so, something that's not connected to the internet 24/7 üôÇ


[05/26/2021 7:53 AM] Busata#9432
I think it's generally recommended not to store coins on exchanges itself, so only send it over when you want to sell I guess


[05/26/2021 7:53 AM] Busata#9432
not that you should sell ergo, you should keep it, cuddle it, and watch it grow for a few years, but that's just me!

Need help on 2 things.  
One I don't know what I'm doing wrong with trying to get somee SigRSV.  I've tried 3 times from the official ergo wallet and yoroi's wallet and nothing has happened so far (did them yesterday at this point so enough time should have gone by).

Two, when transfering some ergo from the official wallet to yoroi (thought maybe the official one didn't work with Sigma).  I think I might have lost 1 ergo in the transaction.  It is showing that I sent 1 ergo to a random address I never entered.  My wallet still says I have what I should have but the address info in the explorer says its not in the address anymore.


[05/26/2021 3:48 PM] Mance Pax#5004
hello again, did you manage to get any news from them? I see that they also stopped ERG deposits, not just withdrawals..


[05/26/2021 5:54 PM] Spicemustflow#1078
Can somebody help me with my ergo node wallet? I‚Äôve managed to deposit some ergo to my address but I cannot see them in my balance. If I click on my address it just says 2000sometging confirmations and still counting.


[05/26/2021 8:03 PM] kushti#0978
You mean ergo node's wallet? Is it synced ?


[05/26/2021 8:03 PM] kushti#0978

Yes, now for some reason my api key isn‚Äôt accepted


[05/26/2021 8:05 PM] TSNP#1337
It would be efficiently if I mine some ERGO directly to my Yoroi-wallet and then transfer it to coinex or gate.io to trade it for some USDT and after that I transfer it to binance and sell it there for my local currency?


[05/26/2021 8:05 PM] TSNP#1337
And also, which is better? coinex or gate.io


[05/26/2021 8:06 PM] andee#4722
gate.io has an insane KYC process from what I have gathered

[05/27/2021 12:32 AM] Michawl_#2646
The deposit address is also shorter than any of the addresses in the mining transaction


[05/27/2021 12:32 AM] Michawl_#2646
But this was the case for both coinex and probit so I don't know what to do here

[05/27/2021 12:50 AM] Michawl_#2646
does that mean I'd have to run a node to get a wallet going right now, not something I'd really want to do...


[05/27/2021 12:52 AM] Nythain#6769
If you in fact encountered this bug, from what i gather your only real option would be setup a node and recreate your wallet with seed. Not sure if thats been proven to work. Has been submitted to github, hopefully they will adress the issue asap but who knows.


[05/27/2021 12:53 AM] Michawl_#2646
how much storage space is a node up to right now roughly?

hey question, i had some extra addresses i created using /wallet/deriveNextKey and they would appear in the panel under wallet addresses. i have since restored that wallet from the mnemonic, but now the other addresses are not visible there.

what do you mean 'reflect' my dude?


[05/27/2021 11:55 AM] glasgowm#9381
As in people often report that issue, then you never hear from them again. So there must be a delay. Or maybe they switch to Yoroi.


[05/27/2021 12:00 PM] Shepolad#5729
aahh ok, think ill switch . thx

[05/27/2021 5:45 PM] arokace#8057
So I transferred some Ergo from my node/wallet to Yoroi.  And my node/wallet reports the correct amount in its wallet (says 2 erg) but when I look at my address in Ergo Explorer it says 1 erg.

Here's the transaction in Ergo Explorer:  https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/d863a179108e573793f54a448cc2dcef158ff115fa7cc0ac88f947b397db5b34

2.024 erg sent to my Yoroi wallet, the 0.001 tx fee to another address, and then shows 1 erg going to an address I have no idea about.  And if you view my whole address it says there's only one.  I would like the erg back but also understand that it might be lost to the ether.  Or maybe this is a bug, idk, 'tis why I'm here.

SigmaUSD also says I only have 1 erg in the wallet (which makes sense, I assume its reading my address from explorer)

Someone sent me 1 erg before and I can see that it looks like it might be typical to send extra Erg out on transactions but with the transaction that they sent me it on it shows their own address for that Erg vs mine is some address I have no control over.
Here's the transaction in explorer:
https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/18e4d06056941783556446277248c2c7cf2968ca747f0fe3d5eacb3a3f455d45


[05/27/2021 8:12 PM] arokace#8057
Ok what is wrong with the node/wallet.  I just sent the stuff from my Yoroi wallet back to my node/wallet.  This went fine.  Then purchased SigmaRSV.  This purchase just sent ANOTHER 1 erg to the same random address.  Like am I not understanding something about the Ergo network or what.  

https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/addresses/9ewvttJ4YbSkM3C9dv855ZkBaEFUume7oKTtRR4w18AXutUc2kJ

Like as far as I can tell no one has control over this address these Erg got sent to.  The total it says to have is about what I should have according to the wallet.  Again the wallet is still reporting what I should have but the explorer does not, I assume the explorer is right


[05/27/2021 8:19 PM] andee#4722
@arokace does the 1 ERG match the fee for purchasing SigmaRSV?


[05/27/2021 8:20 PM] arokace#8057
I don't recall but I don't think the fee was 1 erg on 2 erg worth of RSV


[05/27/2021 8:20 PM] arokace#8057
But this has happened twice now when sending coin out from my node wallet


[05/27/2021 8:21 PM] arokace#8057
I have a grand total of 4 erg, or rather I did


[05/27/2021 8:23 PM] Nythain#6769
Fucked up part is, the first address only has that one transaction and that one erg.


[05/27/2021 8:24 PM] arokace#8057
I got the RSV I purchased, so that part of it went fine.  But I have still lost 2 erg though


[05/27/2021 8:24 PM] andee#4722
is 9ewvttJ4YbSkM3C9dv855ZkBaEFUume7oKTtRR4w18AXutUc2kJ the address?


[05/27/2021 8:25 PM] arokace#8057
that's the random one, yup


[05/27/2021 8:27 PM] arokace#8057
But when I look at my wallet in the node, it shows my erg there... So the wallet knows to look at that address to calculate how much Erg I have (I'm assuming at least)


[05/27/2021 8:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
addreses starting with 9 are yoroi ones usually


[05/27/2021 8:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
Not anything internal to the erg network


[05/27/2021 8:32 PM] glasgowm#9381
Looks like you have a different addresses connected to sigma or something


[05/27/2021 8:34 PM] arokace#8057
That doesn't explain when I transfered from the node/wallet to yoroi then


[05/27/2021 8:36 PM] glasgowm#9381
yeah I mean it's a wallet and not a proxy or fee address


[05/27/2021 8:38 PM] Nythain#6769
really curious to see how this resolves


[05/27/2021 8:39 PM] glasgowm#9381
not sure what you mean. If I had to guess you copied 2 different addresses from the receive tab from the same wallet. Sigma returned it to a different address (under the same wallet) - which is why when you view the address directly via explorer or sigmausd you only see what's on that address. Vs yoroi and node where you'll see the full wallet.


[05/27/2021 8:41 PM] arokace#8057
That is something I've thought that my node/wallet has other addresses it isn't telling me amount.  Would explain why it still thinks I have what I should have.  But I don't have direct control of the address either way, the wallet might indirectly control it though.

But what I was talking about there is from the previous post I said that had nothing to do with Sigma, just transferring from my node wallet to Yoroi.


[05/27/2021 8:41 PM] andee#4722
Just try sending the full amount of your wallet to your main address


[05/27/2021 8:43 PM] glasgowm#9381
yeh just as you said you viewed it in sigma. If you go to the receive tab and scroll down you should see all the associated addresses


[05/27/2021 8:44 PM] arokace#8057
I did Sigma through my node wallet, doesn't have a tab to see associated addresses


[05/27/2021 8:45 PM] arokace#8057
Doesn't like me doing that >_< giving me an error.


[05/27/2021 8:46 PM] andee#4722
look at history on sigmausd.io


[05/27/2021 8:47 PM] arokace#8057
Yea, that's fine.  It says the correct amount for everything.  It isn't a Sigma issue, its a node/wallet issue.


[05/27/2021 8:47 PM] andee#4722
check the addresses in the history


[05/27/2021 8:47 PM] Nythain#6769
so much focus on sigma, when the first instance of the disappearing erg happened before the attempted sigma purchases


[05/27/2021 8:47 PM] arokace#8057
yea


[05/27/2021 8:48 PM] andee#4722
whats the address of the wallet missing erg?


[05/27/2021 8:48 PM] arokace#8057
guess really no one here uses the node/wallet though.  There is no "history" in the node/wallet


[05/27/2021 8:48 PM] arokace#8057
this is my wallet address for the node/wallet that I have been using for mining:  9f5F4UeFEhcVrkdkdK954R9gT5CVS3jtSgwSceHZZMewdAzGjT2


[05/27/2021 8:51 PM] andee#4722
Haven't actually used it for sending/receiving, but I have it running


[05/27/2021 8:51 PM] andee#4722
the history that was talked about was on sigma, not the node wallet

the 1 ERG was sent in the same transaction ü§î


[05/27/2021 8:54 PM] andee#4722
this may be because of how utxo works, no?


[05/27/2021 8:55 PM] arokace#8057
yea, its weird.  and if you look at this transaction (when I received an 1 Erg from someone):  https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/18e4d06056941783556446277248c2c7cf2968ca747f0fe3d5eacb3a3f455d45

You see that it did send an extra erg out to.  The only difference is it sent it right back to their own wallet.  So this leads me to believe there is a bug in there official wallet.


[05/27/2021 8:56 PM] andee#4722
so did you restore from yoroi seed or make a completely new wallet?


[05/27/2021 8:57 PM] arokace#8057
neither


[05/27/2021 8:57 PM] arokace#8057
or what do you mean


[05/27/2021 8:57 PM] arokace#8057
I created the Yoroi wallet when I thought I was doing something wrong with Sigma but turned out I was just being stupid.  But I didn't restore anything though.


[05/27/2021 8:58 PM] arokace#8057
The Yoroi wallet is like 2 days old, my node wallet is at least a month old


[05/27/2021 9:32 PM] arokace#8057
Does anyone know what Spent and Unspent means in Ergo Explorer?

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/670288337747312646/847572899451109376/unknown.png


[05/27/2021 9:55 PM] arokace#8057
Cause I was looking around in swagger and saw a section that says "Get a list of unspent boxes" and the "random address" I have been talking about is there.  So maybe what I'm asking for isn't support at this point but rather an understanding.  Andee said something about how the UTXO system works.  Something about 'change' which is what I was thinking was going on but was still unsure (would explain why the wallet sees what I have).

I guess if what I am gathering is right.  Once I choose to send this coin somewhere else again, my wallet will understand and know to use this "unspent wallet address" to get my ergo from.


[05/27/2021 9:56 PM] arokace#8057
Does this sound remotely correct?


[05/27/2021 11:07 PM] glasgowm#9381
this is just how utxo works


[05/27/2021 11:08 PM] arokace#8057
So just confirming then, I don't have anything to worry about.


[05/27/2021 11:09 PM] glasgowm#9381
nope, just the way utxo does transactions under btc, ada, etc.

keep tabs on the size of the ergo folder, should be a good indication on its progress

well IDK coinex but usually its all the same. sell them for the right price, as USDT, ETH or BTC and then exchange that to fiat. (USD, EUR) 
Later can be withdrawn to your bank account. But agian IDK coinex. Maybe they don't have this feature. Others probably know

Hello. I withdrew some ERGs from coinex to my yoroi and it has over 15 confirmations but I cannot see my ERGs on my yoroi wallet. Any idea if it requires more confirmations or if there has been some sort of bug? I've sent ergs from coinex before without any issues so Im worried something happend.

#üí≥‚îÉyoroi is having issues right now


[05/30/2021 1:33 PM] Melid#1510
I see thanks!


[05/30/2021 1:36 PM] Melid#1510
@glasgowm Btw, does this effect the transaction or just not showing up my total amount?


[05/30/2021 1:41 PM] glasgowm#9381
Your tx is visible on the explorer so it's there, just not displayed by yoroi


[05/30/2021 1:42 PM] Melid#1510
I see then I dont need to worry, thanks again


[05/30/2021 2:51 PM] mconstant#4986
I see a tx on the explorer as well, but not in yoroi


[05/30/2021 2:51 PM] mconstant#4986
can I just try and send the funds?


[05/30/2021 2:54 PM] mconstant#4986
I can't. The wallet address has erg funds on chain, but they don't show in yoroi. Even after 'Resync'


[05/30/2021 2:55 PM] mconstant#4986
please help


[05/30/2021 2:55 PM] mconstant#4986
I think I may avoid yoroi for the time being and start the full node

[05/30/2021 2:55 PM] Nythain#6769
yoroi is experiencing technical difficulties atm. good news is, the funds are where they're supposed to be, the bad news is, yoroi wont show it until they fix the issue


[05/30/2021 2:56 PM] mconstant#4986
so can I use the same seed mnemonic when I start the full node to access the funds?


[05/30/2021 2:56 PM] mconstant#4986
or are the just in limbo till emurgo gets that sorted?


[05/30/2021 2:57 PM] Nythain#6769
you can recreate teh same wallet with the full node


[05/30/2021 3:32 PM] mconstant#4986

amirite?


[05/30/2021 3:55 PM] andee#4722
its not that hard to run the node on windows? just make a bat file, paste the line add pause on next line?


[05/30/2021 3:55 PM] mconstant#4986
right


[05/30/2021 3:56 PM] mconstant#4986
let's make the script


[05/30/2021 3:56 PM] arokace#8057
no its not, I have a batch file too.  But I think mconstant meant for the setup, linux can get it all in one line is what they were saying I think?


[05/30/2021 3:56 PM] mconstant#4986
thing is ... it needs java, and sbt


[05/30/2021 3:56 PM] mconstant#4986
but that could be easy to throw together


[05/30/2021 3:56 PM] andee#4722
if anyone is proficient, make a powershell script to make the secret and add it automagically to the config


[05/30/2021 3:57 PM] mconstant#4986
I only bash


[05/30/2021 3:57 PM] mconstant#4986

[05/30/2021 3:57 PM] mconstant#4986
but I know some powershell people that could help me fish


[05/30/2021 3:57 PM] andee#4722
@mconstant same. I use podman and docker to run the node though


[05/30/2021 3:57 PM] mconstant#4986
thing is package managers for scripting not out of the box on windows


[05/30/2021 3:57 PM] andee#4722
so no java to be found on this system


[05/30/2021 3:57 PM] mconstant#4986
docker is nice


[05/30/2021 3:58 PM] mconstant#4986
podman I can't


[05/30/2021 3:58 PM] mconstant#4986

[05/30/2021 3:58 PM] andee#4722
powershell is on all windows installations though


[05/30/2021 3:58 PM] mconstant#4986
but I should get over teh hate


[05/30/2021 3:58 PM] mconstant#4986
at least it is rootle


[05/30/2021 3:58 PM] mconstant#4986
ss


[05/30/2021 3:59 PM] arokace#8057
I'm not proficent in the slightest but I imagine it couldn't be that hard to learn how to create one to do all that.  I guess the biggest thing is there a way to install java and sbt through command line?


[05/30/2021 3:59 PM] andee#4722
haha. I don't have any hate towards them, but rootless is to be preferred either way

[05/31/2021 8:29 PM] arokace#8057
3070s get about 170mh.  But if you want to see reports, go to the #‚õè‚îÇmining channel pinned messages.  The first one should be a spreadsheet of peoples OCs, their hashes, and what card(s) they are using


[05/31/2021 8:32 PM] titan63#4482
@arokace  thank you, and is 170mh any good?


[05/31/2021 8:32 PM] arokace#8057

That would be me lol


[06/01/2021 4:40 PM] cts#9459
In the process of creating a wallet address and somehow things are not working out correctly.  I got the latest Java installed and the Ergo client release.  I then copied the ergo.conf text and ran the mainnet line as both the website and youtube video explain.  It took a while but eventually I have a little over 6GB of, presumably the blockchain, downloaded.  However where I get stuck is clicking on the 127.0.0.1 URL where I receive the message "error" : 500, "reason" : 
"internal.error", "detail" : "C:\\ (The system cannot find the path specified)"  I'm not seeing where I went wrong, please advise.


[06/01/2021 4:43 PM] andee#4722
@cts you get that at http://127.0.0.1:9053/swagger#/ ?


[06/01/2021 4:45 PM] cts#9459

[06/01/2021 4:45 PM] cts#9459
I just right click and say open in new tab


[06/01/2021 4:46 PM] cts#9459
Now re-reading the prereqs it does state "ergo_folder" which I never did create.  I presumed this was a variable of whatever path or is this supposed to be literal?


[06/01/2021 4:51 PM] arokace#8057
I think I made this mistake too when setting up my node.  I thought that folder was either not gonna matte or get generated itself


[06/01/2021 4:52 PM] andee#4722
shouldn't need to do anything else than put the jar and config in a folder and run, no?


[06/01/2021 4:53 PM] cts#9459
And that may not be the issue.  I'm just wondering what I'm doing wrong to get the 500 error.  Great instructions, a litlte techy, but I'm up for it.


[06/01/2021 4:54 PM] andee#4722
have you tried restarting the node?


[06/01/2021 4:56 PM] andee#4722
If that doesn't work, try refreshing with CTRL + F5


[06/01/2021 5:00 PM] cts#9459
Restart the node with the same mainnet command?


[06/01/2021 5:01 PM] andee#4722
üëç


[06/01/2021 5:02 PM] cts#9459
Restarted, it appears to have simply continued where it left off.  I refreshed the 127.0.0.1 page with the same result.


[06/01/2021 5:03 PM] andee#4722
does http://127.0.0.1:9053/panel work?


[06/01/2021 5:06 PM] cts#9459
Same result


[06/01/2021 5:06 PM] andee#4722
do you have a different browser to test with?


[06/01/2021 5:07 PM] cts#9459
Edge and Chrome have the same result


[06/01/2021 5:08 PM] cts#9459
Now the youtube video and the website have a different initial ergo.conf text.  The website does not state the path as the video does.


[06/01/2021 5:09 PM] cts#9459
I used the text on the website.


[06/01/2021 5:09 PM] andee#4722
thats correct


[06/01/2021 5:09 PM] andee#4722
you dont need that path


[06/01/2021 5:09 PM] cts#9459
I presumed the video was from a former version.


[06/01/2021 5:10 PM] andee#4722
it automatically makes a hidden folder named '.ergo' in the same folder as you have the jar and the config


[06/01/2021 5:11 PM] cts#9459
Correct.  FYI I installed Java version 16.0.1, the latest.


[06/01/2021 5:12 PM] cts#9459
However the PS seems to be running just fine.  A bunch of lines of code are slowly going by.


[06/01/2021 5:13 PM] andee#4722
I see that 9 or 11 is recommended. I am unable to test this unless I spin up a Windows VM


[06/01/2021 5:13 PM] cts#9459
If you suggest then I can uninstall this version and go back to 11.


[06/01/2021 5:14 PM] arokace#8057
I installed 11 I believe because it was one of the recommended ones. And Java is weird, the versions don't dictate what you normally would think a version does.  They have varying properties to them that some applications need from certain versions


[06/01/2021 5:14 PM] arokace#8057
You should be able to uninstall and reinstall the correct version without issue


[06/01/2021 5:14 PM] arokace#8057
probaly don't even need to uninstall the one your put in actually

[06/01/2021 5:35 PM] cts#9459
Well I'm seeing different versions suggested above.  The website suggests 9 or 11, check.  I had 16 and so I uninstalled it.  I downloaded  the JDK 11.0.10 version.  Now it seems to want to rerun the whole thing over again.  Is this normal so far?


[06/01/2021 5:36 PM] ziggomatic#9335
what is "rerun the whole thing over again" ?


[06/01/2021 5:36 PM] cts#9459
When I typed in the mainnet command on the website with the correct version the PS is scrolling like crazy as it was initially.  I can delete the .ergo folder and restart.


[06/01/2021 5:37 PM] ziggomatic#9335
yeah, it does that. it scrolls, while it syncs the blockchain


[06/01/2021 5:37 PM] ziggomatic#9335
you oughta be able to connect to the web server while it does its thing tho right?


[06/01/2021 5:38 PM] cts#9459
Well I need to leave for a bit so it may be wise to just remove the .ergo folder and restart the mainnet command and let it sync while I'm gone.  It is only about 6GB.


[06/01/2021 5:38 PM] ziggomatic#9335
sure

[06/01/2021 5:41 PM] cts#9459
Not sure, I'll let it sync and when I get back then I'll restart and see what happens.  I will say this, for the layman this has got to be an insane way to get a wallet address.


[06/01/2021 5:42 PM] ziggomatic#9335
yeah. that method is definitely not for mainstream consumption yet


[06/01/2021 5:42 PM] ziggomatic#9335
you can build a wallet in yoroi if that's all you want

I prefer desktop wallets though and Ergo sounds like a promising future.


[06/01/2021 5:43 PM] arokace#8057

That's definitely out of my league >_<.


[06/01/2021 5:47 PM] ziggomatic#9335
nah should be barely an inconvenience


[06/01/2021 5:51 PM] andee#4722
@cts paste the cmd you are using to start the node


[06/01/2021 7:51 PM] cts#9459
@andee straight from the Ergo website: java -jar ergo-4.0.11.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf


[06/01/2021 8:07 PM] andee#4722
try re-downloading the jar file if its still messed up. API should be accessible pretty quick after you start the node, even when not synced


[06/01/2021 8:32 PM] cts#9459
No dice.


[06/01/2021 8:33 PM] cts#9459
Still getting the error: 500


[06/01/2021 8:33 PM] cts#9459
reason : internal.error


[06/01/2021 8:33 PM] cts#9459
detail : c:\\ The system cannot find the path specified


[06/01/2021 8:42 PM] arokace#8057
This is being said on the site that's giving the 500 error or is this in the  CMD?


[06/01/2021 8:44 PM] cts#9459
The 500 error comes from the URL 
127.0.0.1:9053/swagger#/utils/hashBlake2b which I type in either Edge or Chrome.


[06/01/2021 8:44 PM] andee#4722
where is your folder located?


[06/01/2021 8:44 PM] andee#4722
what is in your config?


[06/01/2021 8:44 PM] cts#9459
on the C: drive


[06/01/2021 8:45 PM] andee#4722
path of the folder


[06/01/2021 8:45 PM] cts#9459
At the point of running: ergo {
  node {
    mining = false
  }
}


[06/01/2021 8:45 PM] cts#9459
The same text as what is on the website.


[06/01/2021 8:46 PM] cts#9459
Within that folder I have the ergo.conf and jdk 11.0.10


[06/01/2021 8:48 PM] cts#9459
The PS appears to work just fine, initially it downloaded about 6GB before it slowed down and appeared to be merely updating.  I since deleted that .ergo folder and uninstalled the version 16 jdk and started over with the suggested jdk 11.


[06/01/2021 8:49 PM] arokace#8057
The only other thing that's came to my mind is you have something on your computer that blocks accessing 127.0.0.1 addresses honestly.


[06/01/2021 8:49 PM] cts#9459
Possible.  This system is just for wallets.


[06/01/2021 8:50 PM] arokace#8057
That still would seem odd to me, that address is something computers have used to just connect to themselves for a long time.  What kind of security software is running on that computer?


[06/01/2021 8:51 PM] arokace#8057
Windows Firewall is fine.  Do you think you might have hit block before when you were setting it up (not sure if it would have even asked though, shouldn't care about a 127 address)


[06/01/2021 8:52 PM] cts#9459
I temporarily tried without the firewall with the same result


[06/01/2021 8:52 PM] arokace#8057
kk


[06/01/2021 8:52 PM] cts#9459
I'm curious as to what path it is seeking?


[06/01/2021 8:53 PM] arokace#8057
with the 127.0.0.1?


[06/01/2021 8:53 PM] cts#9459
Yes


[06/01/2021 8:53 PM] arokace#8057
I don't recall exactly how that address works but I'm pretty sure it doesn't even leave the computer if I remember right.


[06/01/2021 8:53 PM] andee#4722
I think there must be some problem with the java installation


[06/01/2021 8:54 PM] cts#9459
I could very well be missing a step, I'm just not sure where.  It was pointed out that I should be using version 11 vs. 16 and so I corrected that but that did not change the result.


[06/01/2021 8:57 PM] andee#4722
do you have JRE installed?


[06/01/2021 8:57 PM] cts#9459
jdk


[06/01/2021 8:57 PM] cts#9459
The website said either


[06/01/2021 8:59 PM] andee#4722
do you see any errors in the console output?


[06/01/2021 8:59 PM] andee#4722
look at the output as you try to connect to the API


[06/01/2021 9:00 PM] cts#9459
The text is flying by very, very fast.


[06/01/2021 9:00 PM] cts#9459
A lot of "apply modifier" lines


[06/01/2021 9:03 PM] arokace#8057
See if you can bring up command promt and ping 127.0.0.1


[06/01/2021 9:06 PM] cts#9459
yes


[06/01/2021 9:07 PM] arokace#8057
it pinged fine?  If so then doubt what I was thinking is it

do you have some strange permissions on your stash folder? try stopping the sync and moving the content of the folder where jar, config and .ergo is to C:\ergo


[06/01/2021 9:13 PM] andee#4722
seems like you deleted the path from the chat for some reason, but I assume that the C:!Stash was just a typo


[06/01/2021 9:13 PM] cts#9459
WTF it works!!!


[06/01/2021 9:14 PM] arokace#8057
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh


[06/01/2021 9:14 PM] cts#9459
So is it hardcoded to be c:\ergo?!?


[06/01/2021 9:14 PM] andee#4722
That I doubt

nope, mines on my desktop.

[06/01/2021 9:17 PM] arokace#8057
If what andee was saying about stash is wrong, as in it wasn't a typo and your stash is called !Stash, then it could just be because of that !

I'm back...ugh.  Now I'm getting a bad API key.  I click Try it out and type in a strong password with quotes.  I've tried as little as 10 characters to as many as 64.  I then copy the website text to the conf file and the generated hash key with quotes.  Restart the PS.  Go to the panel link and attempt to enter the same strong password and I get a bad API key.

True - not had any issues with the node - damn stable


[06/02/2021 2:27 PM] cts#9459
@geezar- Thanks for the reponse.  It has been syncing basically all night.  The panel page still says "Active synchronization" and the .ergo folder size is currently 4.5GB.  I presume this may take a while yet then?  Thanks for pointing out that we must wait for the syncing to finish.  I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong last night...


[06/02/2021 2:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
Should tell you the height then you can compare to the explorer


[06/02/2021 2:29 PM] cts#9459
@glasgowm - Please detail?


[06/02/2021 2:29 PM] glasgowm#9381
the page that says active sync also tells you the height


[06/02/2021 2:29 PM] glasgowm#9381
then compare it to https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/


[06/02/2021 2:30 PM] cts#9459
On the Node Information page it shows the version, sync state, started, mining status, and peers connected.


[06/02/2021 2:30 PM] cts#9459
I do see the Explorer tab which is the link above.


[06/02/2021 2:31 PM] geezar#8187
Thats positive, needs to complete - I seem to recal I stopped / re-started as it had hung after a couple hours (run the command line if you still have the console open and re-run the command)

@cts I re-did the build after messing the first try up - the FAQ & Video were slightly inconsistant but 2nd build - waited 5 hours for sync - and perfect, make sure to back up any DIR's 'just in case' always easier to del them if no longer needed or having to restore files etc

another question, whats the exact input size in transactions? is there allowed to have transactions with hundreds or thousands of inputs?


[06/02/2021 9:37 PM] morphic#4133
What is the type of variable x? What you mean by "arbitrary number"?


[06/02/2021 9:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
lets say its long and is the value in R5 of an input box. lets have 15 for K.


[06/02/2021 9:40 PM] morphic#4133
INPUTS(1).R5[Long].get % K should work


[06/02/2021 9:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
neat. I assumed % is not valid due to computational reasons. its not in lang spec neither.


[06/02/2021 9:43 PM] morphic#4133
There is no limit on the number of inputs other than the index must be Int. However, the size of the input collection is multiplied by 2000 and that is added to the block validation cost which is accumulated towards maxBlockCost limit (currently 7000000)

[06/04/2021 7:24 PM] LeggoMyErgo#4477
Correct


[06/04/2021 7:25 PM] glasgowm#9381
They might be stuck in the proxy address. To refund use this

How do I use that?


[06/04/2021 7:27 PM] LeggoMyErgo#4477
Just white page with success false, detail...etc


[06/04/2021 7:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
you substitute the addresses in the link `your_address_set_in_ui` , etc


[06/04/2021 7:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
so the address you in your connected wallet on sigmausd


[06/04/2021 7:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
and the address you sent to


[06/04/2021 7:29 PM] LeggoMyErgo#4477
Hmmm the amount address my receiving address?


[06/04/2021 7:29 PM] LeggoMyErgo#4477
Sorry not technical


[06/04/2021 7:30 PM] glasgowm#9381
`your_address_set_in_ui` = the one set in sigmausd when you hit connect wallet. If you go to that page you can copy it out


[06/04/2021 7:30 PM] glasgowm#9381
`the_long_address_you_sent_to` - should start with some number other than 9


[06/04/2021 7:30 PM] glasgowm#9381
you can get that from yoroi or the explorer


[06/04/2021 7:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
dm me the address if you want me to have a look


[06/04/2021 7:31 PM] LeggoMyErgo#4477
The same one that I sent it to via sigma.io starts with amk

Okay tried that link Glasgow to get it returned and just got an address that starts with a numer


[06/04/2021 7:37 PM] glasgowm#9381
Think that's your receipt - funds should be returned to you


[06/04/2021 7:37 PM] glasgowm#9381
providing it didnt give you an error


[06/04/2021 7:39 PM] LeggoMyErgo#4477
Okay, so lost small % due to fee?


[06/04/2021 7:39 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeh think you lost the tx fee, but it's like 0.0011 erg


[06/04/2021 7:40 PM] glasgowm#9381
If you mean from sigma then yeh there's a 4.5% fee when you go both ways


[06/04/2021 7:41 PM] LeggoMyErgo#4477
Yeah, I didn't  lose that ad never minted just the nominal small fee


[06/04/2021 7:41 PM] LeggoMyErgo#4477
Even that transaction is pending....we'll  see

The problem is it always only transfers 0.08-0.07 erg, and i have to transfer 0.092 erg. Im typing it in but üëÄ


[06/04/2021 7:46 PM] Niko#1921
Do i have to calculate something?


[06/04/2021 7:48 PM] Niko#1921
I tought the fee is added automatically, hence why 0.093erg


[06/04/2021 7:52 PM] LeggoMyErgo#4477
Thank you Glasgow, going to pinn that address. Cheers!


[06/04/2021 8:05 PM] glasgowm#9381
Hard to see what you're doing. 2nd line in your wallet is normally the unspent amount returned to your wallet - or maybe a rounding error in explorer. You don't need to calculate anything.


[06/05/2021 12:26 AM] nitram147#5106
@glasgowm Probably we should introduce something like FAQ feature on the sigmausd site, and make a simple formular where would user enter these two addresses and it will sent the GET request to assm api to refund it üôÇ

Does this api endpoint check when was the funds sent to the proxy address? Otherwise the whale can abuse it to DoS the sigmausd.io üôÅ (The recipient address is encoded in the proxy smart contract so whale can extract it from the corresponding ErgoTree) @anon_real


[06/05/2021 8:05 AM] anon_real#2768
DoS the sigmausd.io?
The proxy contract is a separate entity form Bank contract, can you elaborate?


[06/05/2021 8:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
is there any random generator in ergoscript?


[06/05/2021 8:31 AM] morphic#4133
No, ErgoScript execution should always be deterministic. I remember this question was already discussed somewhere here. Search in #üõ†‚îÇdevelopment and other dev channels.

[06/05/2021 10:18 AM] nitram147#5106
In case that the HTTP GET call to the before mentioned "assm" API, will return funds without any checks (that it won't check how old the transaction sent to the proxy smart contract is), and just construct and sign refunding transaction with assemblernode PK. Then the bearwhale can code simple script which will find every UTxO which belongs to the some sigmausd proxy smartcontract (large part of ErgoTree is the same, difference is only pubkey of destination user & timestamp inserted - so you can write simple regex checking proposition bytes of UTxOs to find all boxes which are locked by sigmausd.io proxy smartcontract). Bearwhale will then extract the P2S address of this boxes and the corresponding user pubkeys of destination user and make tupples from it. For each tupple will bearwhale call "assm" API's refund endpoint with two parameters from the obtained tupple. "assm" endpoint will then instantly issue sign and relay return transactions to the network. If the return transaction will be mined earlier, it will prevent mining of the minting transactions which will result in DoS. I hope you got my idea. So my question was whether the "assm" API is checking the transaction age before issuing refund transaction üôÇ


[06/05/2021 10:20 AM] nitram147#5106
I meaned that it will DoS the proxy contracts as mentioned in my first response. Of course user will be able to construct transaction itself and use bankbox. However the majority of users are using sigmausd.io interface and proxy smart contracts.


[06/05/2021 10:57 AM] anon_real#2768
@nitram147 I get your point but that won't work in practice. First of all, the so-called API only works for the mined UTXOs, not off-chain ones. The minting transaction is generated very soon after the user sends funds. So the attack you explained only works if user tx is mined but the minting/redeeming is not and after that, the whale calls the API. But even in that case, miners have already assembled the next block and are trying to mine it and whale's tx is not in the block for sure and the minting/redeeming tx probably is. But again, even if it is not the case (minting/redeeming tx is not in the next block) then for the next block there is a fair chance that the minting/redeeming tx is invalid whatsoever whether because bank box is spent or oracle data has changed. So in summary, it is very unlikely for the proposed attack to work.


[06/05/2021 10:57 AM] anon_real#2768
Anyway, with dApp connector, soon there won't be any such dramas at all.


[06/05/2021 4:08 PM] nitram147#5106
Yeah, I know that there isn't 100% chance of success but there is at least a little, that why I asked. Did your backend scan for the unconfirmed UTxO to the proxy address and assemble minting/redeeming transaction and publish it even instantly, or does it firstly wait for the user funds to proxy UTxO to confirm? üôÇ


[06/05/2021 4:11 PM] nitram147#5106
Yeah, this should definitely solve the problems. However I still like proxy contracts idea (it's novel to me), because user can use any wallet (even a mobile one in case there will be some) and it will work üòä So keeping support for proxy contracts it's imho needed. How it will work in case of dApp connector with spending bank box - will the app scan for the unconrfimed redeem/minting UTxOs to build a spending transaction upon them, so they all can be minted in the same block? üôÇ


[06/05/2021 5:46 PM] anon_real#2768
As I said, the minting/redeeming tx is assembled almost instantly after the user sends funds and that is why the proposed attack won't work at all (effectively).


[06/05/2021 5:49 PM] anon_real#2768
Yes, proxy contracts are more general.
Yes, the assembler works with offchain boxes which usually results in user funds' tx and the assembled tx to be mined in the same block.

[06/08/2021 12:51 PM] kushti#0978
heh


[06/08/2021 12:51 PM] [Dev] Alex#5249
probably some verification at node code?

first time have this issue with nginx


[06/08/2021 12:58 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
Good morning! Any tip of what is wrong with stratum server? Thanks!


[06/08/2021 1:01 PM] vorujack#1729
It seems your proxy can not connect to node.can you check connection?


[06/08/2021 1:18 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
The proxy on the remote computer you mean? Or the local stratum server?


[06/08/2021 1:20 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
It seems that the proxy cannot connect to the stratum port but, Ive already opened the necessary ports on my router


[06/08/2021 1:20 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
That was 30032 and 30256


[06/08/2021 1:20 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
Should I also open port to the node in this case?


[06/08/2021 1:36 PM] zargarzadehmoein#2928
no need but i think there is a problem between your router and stratum server or didn't open ports


[06/08/2021 1:40 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
is there any changing like local ip i should modify in the stratum server side, for example to run it in the eth0 instead run at localhost?


[06/08/2021 2:04 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362

Hi, I have some EFYT in my waves wallet, is it possible to convert?


[06/08/2021 3:13 PM] glasgowm#9381
There's a EFYT/ERG pair on waves I believe


[06/08/2021 3:14 PM] 3rd#6931
direct 1 for 1?


[06/08/2021 3:14 PM] 3rd#6931
but....


[06/08/2021 3:14 PM] 3rd#6931
does that give me the real token?

[06/08/2021 3:59 PM] zargarzadehmoein#2928
yeah now this problem there is in stratum server
in a bit time node return a 500 error `Skipping candidate generation, one is already in progress`  /mining/candidate now stratum don't handle this error and we try to solve this problem ASAP but this problem does not prevent the work process stratum server.


[06/08/2021 4:30 PM] lpsdamaceno#7362
Is there any special setting that should be done at start.js? I've already configured ports and wallet. Anything related to the network card IP?


[06/08/2021 11:06 PM] kushti#0978
yes, on EFYT/ERG pair, there's a buy order there


[06/09/2021 3:32 PM] 3rd#6931
so ERG is a coin on the WAVES platform?


[06/09/2021 3:39 PM] 3rd#6931
there is no EFYT/ERG pair, im looking at the waves exchange now


[06/09/2021 3:41 PM] 3rd#6931
how do i convert my EFYT into ERG and put in a wallet?


[06/09/2021 3:47 PM] andee#4722
there is a EFYT/WAVES pairing


[06/09/2021 3:48 PM] 3rd#6931
i know, but i want to convert the EFYT token into a ERG token 1 for 1


[06/09/2021 3:48 PM] 3rd#6931
and put it in the wallet


[06/09/2021 3:48 PM] 3rd#6931
how do i do that


[06/09/2021 3:51 PM] andee#4722
I don't know of any way to do a 1:1, on waves you have to sell for waves, then buy erg with waves


[06/09/2021 3:52 PM] 3rd#6931
what was the point of the airdrop if it isn't one for one?


[06/09/2021 3:52 PM] 3rd#6931
this token EFYT which was airdropped is literally useless


[06/09/2021 3:56 PM] andee#4722
last price EFYT/WAVES was .645, last price ERG/WAVES was .5. So that would equal 1.29ERG per EFYT. But the liquidity seems low


[06/09/2021 3:57 PM] 3rd#6931
yer no kidding, what is function does this coin? where does it get its value?


[06/09/2021 3:59 PM] andee#4722
seems like the payment gateway is not supported by waves anymore


[06/09/2021 3:59 PM] 3rd#6931
um what?


[06/09/2021 3:59 PM] andee#4722
the system that was used for exchanging 1:1


[06/09/2021 3:59 PM] 3rd#6931
yer i know


[06/09/2021 8:24 PM] Pharotek#2932
how are people setting up NBminer on Hivos? its not an option in dropdown

you can set to any miner, just click to expand it

Ergo support, not hiveos ü§£


[06/09/2021 11:11 PM] kushti#0978
put manually "EFYT/ERG" into search bar, waves exchange is hiding the pair otherwise ((


[06/10/2021 11:28 AM] 3rd#6931
after i do so, what do I do with the ERG token?


[06/10/2021 11:31 AM] glasgowm#9381
Withdraw to yoroi or set up a full node. Ledger support underway


[06/10/2021 11:31 AM] 3rd#6931
so ERG is token on top of waves or it has it's own blockchain?


[06/10/2021 11:32 AM] glasgowm#9381
It's own blockchain - they're both based on ScoreX I believe


[06/10/2021 11:33 AM] 3rd#6931
but there is no gateway right? so how do i send it to my wallet?


[06/10/2021 11:33 AM] glasgowm#9381
There's a Gravity integration happening which is done by people from waves (not sure the exact relationship to waves there either)


[06/10/2021 11:33 AM] glasgowm#9381
you just withdraw - not sure what you mean


[06/10/2021 11:34 AM] 3rd#6931
gravity integration means gateway?


[06/10/2021 11:34 AM] glasgowm#9381
It's a gateway-like thing that connects oracles. Not sure what you mean by gateway.


[06/10/2021 11:35 AM] 3rd#6931
i see


[06/10/2021 11:35 AM] glasgowm#9381
read through #deleted-channel - you got lucky with an airdrop if you dont even know what erg is lol

```
Ergo‚Äôs Oracle Pools have also been embodied by Gravity Protocol. The partnership agreement was also an essential step in connecting the Waves and EMURGO Research & Development departments, pushing forward eUTxO research for the ecosystem as a whole. Ergo and Waves have always had a strong relationship, with Ergo‚Äôs First Year Token initially being released on the Waves blockchain. Ergo Core Developer Alex Chepurnoy and Sasha Ivanov, the founder of Waves, had collaborated in the past, and Waves was always a firm supporter of Ergo‚Äôs development. 

So far, the concepts implemented in Ergo seem complex, multi-layered algebraic abstractions and are somewhat difficult for developers to grasp, however, it‚Äôs precisely this radically new perspective that helps create innovative protocols and might be essential in solving problems in decentralized systems and improving them, be that architecture of a blockchain network or a network of oracles.

@zargarzadehmoein any though about that?


[06/11/2021 4:18 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
Ok... Now i have something:


[06/11/2021 4:19 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
i've ran the proxy in the localhost, in the same machine of the Stratum server.

[06/11/2021 4:19 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
Ive already done that:

[06/11/2021 4:20 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
that forwards ethernet connections to the lopcalhost address.


[06/11/2021 4:20 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
i've already openened the port on my router forawarding it do the server too.

(i've already tried to run server as root)


[06/11/2021 4:31 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
these two different nmaps is from different machines. In the left, an other machine doeing nmap inside lan to the proxy ip. In the right, the machine of the proxy server doeing the same nmap to its ip.

[06/11/2021 4:34 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
if i go to web browser and put my ip (192.168.0.110:3000) it gives me an page with "status fail" wich i interpretate as an message and successfull connection to the program.


[06/11/2021 4:35 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
but if i do the same in another machine inside LAN  it gives nothing. Simplily doesnt connect.


[06/11/2021 5:36 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
Ok... Now i get it, i need to manually open the port in my local machine that runs the server. Openning it i can connect remotely to the stratum server


[06/11/2021 5:36 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
but there is other problems:


[06/11/2021 5:37 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362

now i get it the meaning of "this is only a proxy"... NBminer supports stratum protocol.


[06/11/2021 5:48 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
connected well.


[06/11/2021 5:48 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
just openened the stratum port and enabled it manually in my machine and then connected.

You probably followed the video tutorial posted in the auction house channel. It is outdated for the newest version. When creating on ergo utils there will be a checkbox labeled upload artwork. If you click that the image will show in the auctionhouse

Don't need to upload on the BB site.

[06/12/2021 2:22 PM] andee#4722
@Zteelh its not for viewing it, but to input the seed and get a confirmation if it matches the wallet


[06/12/2021 2:22 PM] andee#4722
what you posted a screenshot of is example output


[06/12/2021 2:23 PM] Zteelh#5292
ok, its possible to view my mnemonic again?


[06/12/2021 2:25 PM] andee#4722
not that I know of


[06/12/2021 2:27 PM] Zteelh#5292
oh well I guess i will have to make another wallet then, it seems I maybe mix the mnomonics so what i imported to yoroi I have no idea what the original wallet was, thx for answer


[06/12/2021 2:28 PM] andee#4722
you can check if its correct though, that's what it is used for


[06/12/2021 2:29 PM] andee#4722
if its correct it returns "matched": true


[06/12/2021 2:30 PM] Zteelh#5292
in what option I can do that?


[06/12/2021 2:32 PM] andee#4722
Click 'Try it out' and then input mnemonic and pass


[06/12/2021 2:32 PM] andee#4722

kk thx, this wallet node is over complicated remembers me a lot the old schools wallets, thx for the help


[06/12/2021 2:34 PM] andee#4722
its not really for the average user, its for people that need a local node that can be accessed via an API


[06/12/2021 2:34 PM] andee#4722
is there a reason you stopped using yoroi?


[06/12/2021 2:43 PM] Zteelh#5292
well at least this one have an UI üòõ that old ones nop... About Yoroi i never liked that kind of plugins wallets

[06/12/2021 2:44 PM] andee#4722
I know its not optimal, but from what I have seen there is a desktop wallet in the works

Getting ung up on API key, Ive got the wallet up, web interface going, When I try to use my API key it tells me "Bad API Key" did  make it too short or something ( its more than just Hello and is alphanumeric


[06/14/2021 9:35 AM] Gazza_SP#5835
Did you restart your full node after updating your API key? I had this issue and thats what solved it for me.


[06/14/2021 9:43 AM] Kultus#1594
apart from Closing the window as the video said to do, how do I shut it down ?


[06/14/2021 10:44 AM] Gazza_SP#5835
Ya once you close the powershell window and then run the start script again that's all you need to do. Did it help?

now I have another issue, but all in all wallet is up and going, but when I made my wallet it returned a time out error on the API and didn't feedback my mnemonic  phrase, is there a way to retrieve it


[06/14/2021 12:34 PM] Kultus#1594
of course I dont want a wallet I can't restore, so If need be I'll remake it, but hopeful there is a quick way to get access to it


[06/14/2021 2:49 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
There's no way to retrieve the mnemonic I believe, it's derived from your secret key somehow so if you didn't get it, I think you have to setup a new one!

Hi, I transferred some ERG to WAVES  to provide liquidity on the USDN/ERG pool they have there.  My transaction is complete on the ERGO side, but funds have not appeared in my WAVES wallet.  I've previously sent a smaller amount successfully.  Is there an expected time delay on the gateway with WAVES Exchange?


[06/14/2021 3:25 PM] andee#4722
most exchanges requires x confirmations before its deposited to your account. this should be in #üí∞‚îÇtrading btw, this is ergo support not waves


[06/14/2021 3:58 PM] thatexactmike#4716
OK.  thanks.


[06/14/2021 4:01 PM] thatexactmike#4716
Trading seems to be all about price discussion, however, and this is a support question, not a question about trading ERGO for something else.  I've sent ERG to another ERG address and the ERG is not appearing there yet.  I get that my issue is going to be a joint effort between WAVES exchange and ERGO, but it is a technical issue not a trading issue.


[06/14/2021 4:03 PM] andee#4722
@thatexactmike sure, but it is exchange related. if they don't appear in your exchange wallet there is no support to get here. you will need to either ask waves or someone that uses waves and has deposited to them before


[06/14/2021 4:03 PM] andee#4722
depositing to an exchange is related to trading


[06/14/2021 4:04 PM] thatexactmike#4716
understand, I've initiated a support request with Waves exchange as well.


[06/14/2021 4:04 PM] andee#4722
I know some places needs 100 confirmations before they deposit to exchange wallet, some require less, some may require more


[06/14/2021 4:42 PM] thatexactmike#4716
Just a follow up here.  there are issues with the gateway on the Waves exchange side and they expect to have them resolved in about 24-36 hours.  Per their support, transferred funds will be credited when the issue is resolved.

mm, when launching a ergo node for the first time it seems to sync but I can't access the api wsoe.. I do see some stacktraces when launching it (one for swaggerconfig, the other for wallet secret key), but perhaps those are common if api key is not set yet, any other common issues? I'm trying to curl to it from the machine I've installed it on


[06/15/2021 6:28 PM] Busata#9432
the conf is the default one from the wiki


[06/15/2021 7:04 PM] Busata#9432
so, assume the first one is ok, the swagger one seems related to the api so not sure what's happening there

[06/15/2021 7:33 PM] Busata#9432
seems to be an encoding issue, doesn't seem to resort to utf-8 by default for some reason, weird since it's a clean ubuntu install


[06/15/2021 11:15 PM] andee#4722
@Busata what do you have in your config?


[06/15/2021 11:16 PM] Busata#9432
just had the default mining=false , but launching the jar with -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 seems to fix the issue, not sure why


[06/15/2021 11:17 PM] Busata#9432
from what I understand it's failing to read the swagger yaml correctly & not launching the api due to that, cause that's what the second trace seems about


[06/15/2021 11:20 PM] andee#4722
```ergo {
    node {
        mining = false
    }
}
```
or `ergo.node.mining = false` ?


[06/15/2021 11:20 PM] Busata#9432
the first


[06/15/2021 11:21 PM] andee#4722
just had to confirm you didn't have just mining=false üôÇ


[06/15/2021 11:24 PM] Busata#9432
guess my locale isn't setup correctly on that server, from what I read, jvm picks up the wrong one as default & probably tries to read the yaml in something else than UTF-8, hence my fix working


[06/15/2021 11:24 PM] Busata#9432
weird cause I've run a node before with the same image but eh

@Len Grace you do not earn ERG running a node


[06/23/2021 4:49 PM] TradeMyWhat#5011
what is the point of running the node then? @andee


[06/23/2021 4:58 PM] andee#4722
@TradeMyWhat to have a copy of the blockchain locally, which has a lot of use cases. helping others sync their node faster, solo mining, or running a pool. people running nodes also increases decentralization of the ledger


[06/23/2021 4:59 PM] andee#4722
you don't receive any bitcoin for running a bitcoin node, you get no eth for running an ethereum node


[06/23/2021 5:04 PM] TradeMyWhat#5011
@andee yeah definitely understand the benefits for the ledger. Could you expand a bit on how it helps with solo mining please?


[06/23/2021 5:08 PM] andee#4722
@TradeMyWhat you need to run a node for solo mining, without it you have no way to provide the solution for the block or provide the miner with anything to hash


[06/23/2021 5:11 PM] TradeMyWhat#5011
@andee what if you are using HiveOs to solo mine with GPU?


[06/23/2021 5:12 PM] andee#4722
you still need a node, unless you solo mine to a pools node


[06/23/2021 5:13 PM] andee#4722
proper solo mining requires running a node

[06/24/2021 10:17 PM] arokace#8057
Don't think there is.  Think your syncing might have screwed up.  It should take 4-6hours but certainly not all day.  So you might need to restart from the beginning

does it need any specific ports open?


[06/25/2021 12:04 AM] arokace#8057
when ever its going you can see what block its currently on.  You'll see a pattern as the text flies by and you'll see a number in there that keeps on growing.  It needs to get to the current block height twice, onces for sync and once for something with the UTXO


[06/25/2021 12:05 AM] arokace#8057
no, not that I'm aware of

I even used separate batch files for that particular card and it still doesn't make a difference


[06/28/2021 8:14 PM] Terremot#4855
Checked to make sure I had Gen2 enabled in bios and above 4g decoding, which at this stage shouldn't really matter


[06/28/2021 8:16 PM] Terremot#4855
Has anyone any idea what could be causing the issue?


[06/28/2021 8:17 PM] Terremot#4855
The power is stable at 88W on the card, whereas the other card I have, it keeps dropping to 65W

Hi Admins/Mods can you please block ban:  Dapps|query handler#7175 sending dm's claiming to be from support, thanks


[07/03/2021 4:24 PM] T R A X E N#7277
Hey, I am facing some bios modding problems.
So I save the original bios than I open Polaris Bios Editor, open the original bios one time patching it and than saving it.
After this I open amdvbflashWin.exe, loading modded bios than program it. After this I reboot my PC.
Than I run atikmdag-patcher getting "driver successfully patched" and than the system reboots but when I go back to the device manager I get error code 3.
I am doing it with only 1 GPU.
I will be grateful if someone can help me 3 days in a row same thing.

HI folks, I hope you have a great weekend! Could some share his knowledge and tell me more on what **coin daemon is and its purpose(your 2 cents or any good kb url would be great)? **New to this stuff and I'm not sure if I'm looking the right information. Additionally, I've been playing with ergo-nomp from github and one of their requirements is to obtain ***"Coin daemon(s) (find the coin's repo and build latest version from source)"*** Where could I get more info ergo daemon coin? That you in advance for any feedback. Cheers!

y in the world they couldn't call it ergo node ? @andee so to confirm that should be ergo node and not just node js package correct?


[07/04/2021 4:02 PM] andee#4722

[07/08/2021 8:26 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
but i get confused he says at 1:37 min he said paste the ergo file he downloaded and he didn't download anything


[07/08/2021 8:27 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
the last file downloaded was the ergo client release


[07/08/2021 8:27 AM] Awdi4Life#9782

just read the guide and everything will be clear


[07/08/2021 8:29 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
but i am confused when he pasted those other folders where he got them from i started on the next step creating the config file tho but i missed that step where he moved the folders its confusing where he moved them from


[07/08/2021 8:30 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
cuz the last file he downloaded was the ergo client release then all sudden he addes files to the ergo folder when he didn't download anything


[07/08/2021 8:30 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
obviously not


[07/08/2021 8:32 AM] andee#4722
@Awdi4Life you are talking about problems understanding the video


[07/08/2021 8:32 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
no


[07/08/2021 8:32 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
read what i said at 1 min 37 seconds he pastes files in the folder and i have no clue where he got them from


[07/08/2021 8:33 AM] andee#4722
there is nothing written about moving anything in the guide


[07/08/2021 8:33 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
its in the video


[07/08/2021 8:33 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
1:37


[07/08/2021 8:34 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
its actually at 1:52


[07/08/2021 8:34 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
he says "i'll paste that ergo file i downloaded"


[07/08/2021 8:34 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
and he didnt download anything


[07/08/2021 8:34 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
the last file downloaded was the ergo release client


[07/08/2021 8:35 AM] andee#4722
its the node


[07/08/2021 8:35 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
see my screenshot


[07/08/2021 8:35 AM] andee#4722
download node, put in folder, make config, run


[07/08/2021 8:35 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
but at 152 he moves other folders to the ergo folder


[07/08/2021 8:36 AM] andee#4722
no, he showed the folder after having run the node. you can see him pasting the jar, it becomes blue because it gets selected


[07/08/2021 8:36 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
its the log.gz file


[07/08/2021 8:37 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
that im missing i dont see where he got it


[07/08/2021 8:37 AM] andee#4722
the text guide with screenshots is easier and faster, its very concise


[07/08/2021 8:38 AM] andee#4722
because you are not adding it, like I said he has already ran the node before capturing his screen there


[07/08/2021 8:38 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
well when i tried running the command it didnt go


[07/08/2021 8:39 AM] andee#4722
any error?


[07/08/2021 8:40 AM] andee#4722
you only need the jar and the config file


[07/08/2021 8:40 AM] andee#4722
and java ofc


[07/08/2021 8:42 AM] Awdi4Life#9782
it says unable to access jar file


[07/08/2021 8:43 AM] andee#4722

Anyone having issues trying to send from Yoroi to an exchange?  it shows the check mark, next screen it shows balances in red and then after i hit submit it takes a second and goes back to the wallet where nothing happens.

Could it be that there is a minimum?


[07/10/2021 11:08 PM] godsendtoxic#7683
Try sending it to another one of your wallets if you have one for a sanity check, my Yoroi hasn't been processing my transactions since my last message


[07/10/2021 11:08 PM] godsendtoxic#7683
One other person DMed me with a similar problem but no solution

same thing, at first i was like so... did it work? or not.


[07/11/2021 3:01 AM] Apextheory#6577
It does not show up in Yoroi until your transaction is mined and part of a block


[07/11/2021 3:01 AM] Apextheory#6577
But you can look for your "pending" transaction in the mempool here https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/mempool


[07/11/2021 3:01 AM] Apextheory#6577
As you can see, there is congestion right now, not sure the cause.

If had over 40-50 transactions with them and of course when i get the biggest bag ever, it happens. I'm a little nervous that CoinEx is based in HK and I've heard horror stories about their terrible customer service over on their subreddit


[07/16/2021 12:32 AM] andee#4722
I would start by trying to contact them directly. and double checking the tx you sent


[07/18/2021 9:46 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
I had a failed withdrawal with coinex and support fixed it 3 hours after I raised a ticket, they seem to be pretty helpful in general so I wouldn't panic yet if you sent to the correct address.

NP. the trick is knowing that the auction address is an input and output, and holds the NFT until it ends.

!!staking


[08/08/2021 3:52 PM] PhenoBot#9345
Ergo is a Proof of Work blockchain, rather than Proof of Stake. However there is a staking solution being worked using the tokenisation of dApps that is almost complete. 

The first implementation of this will be on #ergomixer - more details available here

Yeh I had a similar issue a minute ago with sigmausd. Maybe something to do with a hashrate flux and the assembler. Seems to act up from time to time. I've said to Dev but if you try a few times or wait a bit, should go through.


[08/14/2021 10:14 AM] glasgowm#9381
I usually send at the same time when minting, spoke to @Foeniculum and he said 

The process is:
- Create auction
- Send ERG / token to the address (doesn't matter which one you send first)
- Wait for 1 confirmation (otherwise Yoroi will ignore that transaction. instead of "queuing it up")
- Send ERG / token to the same address (whichever wasn't sent the first time)

So that might be your issue

If you HAVEN'T minted your NFT yet, you have to set up an auction first and then mint the NFT on ErgoUtils

If your NFT has already been minted, you don't need to use ErgoUtils and follow the steps in Glasgow's comment


[08/14/2021 12:01 PM] godded#6801
NFTs were already minted.
I figured it out I think. Apparently Yoroi always sends 0.011 ERG (or 0.01 ERG not sure, I'm not at my PC) with each NFT and the auction house seems to "expect" that you send your NFT from Yoroi. So it suggests 0.292 ERG + 0.011 ERG being sent with the Token => 0.303 ERG for the auction. However I was not sending from Yoroi, so my token didn't get sent with the "additional" 0.011 ERG and the contract conditions were not met.
I think this should be addressed on the auction house side, because it's basically assuming everyone is using a wallet that always attaches 0.011 ERG with the token transfer.


[08/14/2021 1:44 PM] godded#6801
Thank you. For taking the time and help me out with this.

Did you send the ERG from the Android mobile wallet by any chance?


[08/14/2021 2:06 PM] godded#6801
Desktop - ergowallet.io


[08/14/2021 2:06 PM] andee#4722
@godded is it this the 0.0011ERG you are thinking of?

[08/14/2021 2:06 PM] Foeniculum#3278
Oh gotcha, I'm using Yoroi desktop extension but I thought the desktop one was the same!


[08/14/2021 2:09 PM] godded#6801
I'd have to get back on my PC to confirm, which I might be able to once I've put my kids to sleep (6 months and 3 years, might be a while).
But iirc when I sent a token via Yoroi I saw it automatically added 0.011 ERG with the transaction. I think 0.001 is the "intrinsic" ERG value of the token but it adds another 0.01 ERG (for whatever reason) this also seems to happen when you mint an NFT and send it.


[08/14/2021 2:26 PM] Foeniculum#3278
When you mint an NFT you can set that value to 0. Whatever amount of ERG you put in the box on ErgoUtils is gonna be sent to the minting address, so it's not actually something you're paying to mint


[08/14/2021 11:23 PM] godded#6801
Yeah I know, but when you send from Yoroi, I don't think you can change it. The 0.01 ERG just gets added to the transaction with the Token just before you enter your spending password and confirm it. 
And the auction house only tells you to send e.g. 0.292 ERG and the Token, which simply is not enough if you only send that exact amount. It has to be 0.302 ERG + Token to fulfill the contract, or like Yoroi does it 0.292 + (0.01 + Token).

[08/15/2021 5:43 AM] andee#4722
every wallet adds this fee, without it the transaction will not get mined


[08/15/2021 6:49 AM] godded#6801
Ergo wallet.io doesn't. It only adds 0.001 ERG as the mining fee. Which is fine. It's about the 0.01 ERG added to the transaction of the token (that's not a fee afaik)


[08/15/2021 6:50 AM] andee#4722
but the screen you posted shows only the fee added to the total


[08/15/2021 6:50 AM] godded#6801
I'm talking about the 0.01 ERG next to the exclamation mark in my screenshot, not the 0.0011 in fees


[08/15/2021 6:51 AM] andee#4722
oooh, just saw it


[08/15/2021 6:51 AM] andee#4722
didn't notice that the tx was for 1 erg


[08/15/2021 6:52 AM] godded#6801
So the transaction is actually a (1) token + 0.01 ERG and the fees are 0.0011 ERG


[08/15/2021 6:58 AM] godded#6801
It really makes sense, because my auction starting bid was 0.3 ERG, so the contract needs 0.302 ERG + the token. It is however a bit misleading if you don't use a wallet that does not add this 0.01 ERG to the transaction of the token automatically. Because if I transfer the token and then 0.292 ERG from the desktop wallet (ergowallet.io) then I never fullfil the contract and the auction does not get created.
I'm not sure when anon_real changed this, because when you look at the guide video about how to create auctions (I think the one with the ergo Christmas NFT) , the amount the auction house calls for is the exact amount of the starting bid, but nowadays it automatically asks for 0.01 ERG less, assuming it will get the 0.01 ERG from the token transaction anyway (which is the case on Yoroi)


[08/15/2021 7:00 AM] godded#6801
I would love to bring it up with him directly, but despite him posting on the ergo forums that people can DM him on Discord, I haven't seen him on this server yet, so I figured the best I can do is bring it up here in the support channel and pray someone with connections to him forwards the "issue"

Does ergo platform profitability calculator not take into account difficulty? https://ergoplatform.org/en/mining/ cause my 24H rewards (tested on herominers and nanopool) seem to be way off despite I am using the effective hashrate (in particular in nanopool I can see the effective average of the last 1,2,6,12,24 hours and I input a slightly lower value than I get from that into the ergo platform profitability calculator)  but the actual rewards are way off (lower) than what the calculator predicts


[08/21/2021 9:47 PM] godded#6801
Well there is luck (how many blocks did the pool actually find relative to it's, then current, hash rate and difficulty), dev fee (miner) and pool fee, so keep those in mind.
On both nanominers and 2miners I've had pretty spot on payouts based on https://ergoplatform.org/en/mining/ for my hash rate, taking fees into account on days with close to 100% (perfectly average) luck.
For herominers I've only tried that pool for a week, but it was consistently lower than what I expected for my hashrate (I think that's due their payment model and pool hoppers).
Woolypooly I've never given a fair shake, because of this https://woolypooly.medium.com/wooly-payment-distribution-system-d299cede9c9d
Since I only have one worker on ERG and not the most stable power grid, I didn't feel like being annoyed about loosing my 100% parcipitation (which apparently takes a few days to build up to full) everytime I have a connection drop or have to do rig maintenance.

I found statistics of 3060 ti lhr on minerstat, which looks quite promising. Maybe by any chance you know anybody who actually mine ergo on lhr videocard? How many mgs of ergo do you get from lhr card? I have read that there are two generations of those cards, and second is blocked against ergo. Is it true?

Hi everyone, I have just now started mining Ergo, for a change,  after having been on ETH until now.
One thing I am noticing is that the miner (TRM on HiveOS n my case) keeps recreating tables after every few minutes during which the Hashrate drops to almost half & then it gets back to its peak again. This is cyclical & I am pretty sure it is going to affect my overall average hashrate.
Is there something that I am doing wrong of is it just the way Ergo mining works?
Doesn't this mean that whatever daily earning data is shown on whattomine for ergo is going to be substantially more than actual earnings due to this constant recreation of tables & fall in hashrate?

i know that the wallet worked at one time since i did a test send first


[08/24/2021 4:13 PM] glasgowm#9381
I don't recognise the interface but it's probably on a derived address. Yoroi is the first option then node if that doesn't work

You only can see the wallets public address and amount of tokens.

you need to wait for the node to finish the scan

[08/25/2021 11:50 PM] BuffNdaMuffN#4152

stop node, delete `.ergo/{history,state}`start node and wait for resync if it doesn't work


[08/26/2021 3:14 AM] BuffNdaMuffN#4152
Should I be worried that node wallet balance reads 0?


[08/26/2021 8:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
I don‚Äôt think so


[08/26/2021 1:20 PM] BuffNdaMuffN#4152
So the node is fully synced buy the wallet seems to be stuck on active synchronization. I tried deleting .ergo/{history,state} but no luck.


[08/26/2021 3:19 PM] glasgowm#9381
you need to wait for it to sync - you can track on the panel or cli and compare against the explorer. 

If it's on active sync it's not fully sync'd what do you mean?


[08/26/2021 3:39 PM] BuffNdaMuffN#4152
In the past I don't remember the sync taking so long so I assumed it was maybe stuck in a loop or something. Didn't know I could track the progress of the sync. I'll have to look into it when I get back later today. Thanks.

Hi not sure if I'm writing in right location but I want to ask if anyone knows this.
Basically I found out that ergo network has a feature for stale wallets being taxed but does that also effect wallets that get deposits only or effects only those that don't get used at all. üßê

[08/26/2021 7:51 PM] Alien Œ£ Crypto#4489
Ok yes every 4 years fee for but I'm still confused or not understand the difference between or if even there is a difference between wallets that are not used for 4 years and wallets that are used but only to hold erg. Basically if this makes any sense


[08/26/2021 7:52 PM] andee#4722
you can avoid if by sending your wallet balance to yourself every 3.5 years


[08/26/2021 7:52 PM] andee#4722
its not like it empties your wallet after 4 years, it a little every 4 years


[08/26/2021 7:54 PM] Alien Œ£ Crypto#4489
As an example right now I only have a wallet that I add erg from mining like 50% on my mining goes in to this wallet. But only transactions I make in that wallet are deposits


[08/26/2021 7:55 PM] andee#4722
when you get a deposit, that creates a box. after 4 years of not moving, that box will be charged storage rent unless you send all those boxes to yourself


[08/26/2021 7:56 PM] Alien Œ£ Crypto#4489
Actually I don't mind fees but I wanted to be clear as to how it works. Thanks for clearing that up. üëÜ


[08/26/2021 7:57 PM] andee#4722
you get around this by sending your whole wallet balance to yourself. that consolidates all those boxes to one new box


[08/26/2021 7:58 PM] Alien Œ£ Crypto#4489
Ok, but I think I would rather pay fee and not risk losing and or exposing my wallet to outside world.


[08/26/2021 7:59 PM] Alien Œ£ Crypto#4489

Anyone know about yoroi only allowing one transaction at a time? "
ATTENTION:
Cannot send a new transaction while an existing one is still pending."

is this just based on how the network works, with UTXO?


[08/27/2021 5:42 AM] Marty#4039

"Error: We haven't seen that IP for your address"


[08/27/2021 7:48 AM] RibDibBibarel#8625
I quintuple checked and I am 100% entering the correct IP address for my miner.


[08/27/2021 7:49 AM] RibDibBibarel#8625
I think there is something wrong with whatever y'all are using to check IP addresses because this one worked when I set up my settings.


[08/27/2021 7:54 AM] RibDibBibarel#8625
Nm, fixed. Had to use my desktop's IP address, Y'all need to fix this, because it does not actually check the miner's IP address.


[08/27/2021 7:59 AM] andee#4722
@RibDibBibarel Ergo does not operate any pools. as long as you mine at home your desktop IP will be the same as you have on your miner

So I transferred sigUSD back for a refund. I put in the address, amount of ERG was 0.01, 2500 sigUSD, and 0.01 fee. Looks like the refund failed and on the explorer its showing I now have 0.0088 ERG and 25 sigUSD. The SigUSD website shows the same. I hope I'm reading something wrong because I didn't send 438 ERG to redeem 2500 sigUSD. Any help?


[08/27/2021 2:06 PM] andee#4722
what address?


[08/27/2021 2:14 PM] BuffNdaMuffN#4152

Are you aware of a problem with transactions?

I still experience some problems... Transactions not being processed


[08/27/2021 2:26 PM] phoenix#1525

[08/27/2021 2:41 PM] andee#4722
can you try restoring the wallet in yoroi? yoroi should add it automatically


[08/27/2021 2:42 PM] BuffNdaMuffN#4152
do i have to do anything on the node side?


[08/27/2021 2:45 PM] andee#4722
yoroi is a browser extension


[08/27/2021 2:46 PM] andee#4722
you could try deriving addresses using the api on the node, but its just so much easier to restore in yoroi and have it do it automatically


[08/27/2021 2:50 PM] BuffNdaMuffN#4152
so yoroi wallet is created. shows i have 0 ERG and somehow i sent 438 ERG this morning.

[08/27/2021 3:12 PM] anon_real#2768
As far as I am seeing, only 25 SigUSD is sent and it is rejected and refunded to `9g9wU4kTMaKbQd3SLHCyQS8xcpTNysPfiLrWiFAX5uvMXsyE5R4`
The change (480 ERGs and 2475 SigUSD) is also sent to the change address `9eqHwBGhaafXgiyJhJDqFPezRvQye8DE8Cqw82c58p3ZBNnUhkB`


[08/27/2021 3:13 PM] anon_real#2768
If you can't see it in your Yoroi, maybe there are some issues on their side - not sure though.


[08/27/2021 3:13 PM] andee#4722
he was originally using the node


[08/27/2021 3:14 PM] andee#4722
I was thinking the same, but isn't it normal for the change to not be included in the amount?

[08/27/2021 4:53 PM] BuffNdaMuffN#4152
So the best I can tell is when I tried to redeem sigUSD this morning my address( 9g9wU4kTMaKbQd3SLHCyQS8xcpTNysPfiLrWiFAX5uvMXsyE5R4 ) sent some amount of sigUSD( I typed 2500 but wallet shows 250000 as amount not sure why. Missing a decimal? "2500.00" ). Transaction failed and SigmaUSD refunded me. Somehow 438 ERG was sent to ( 9eqHwBGhaafXgiyJhJDqFPezRvQye8DE8Cqw82c58p3ZBNnUhkB ). My ERGO node wallet "seems" to see it but Yoroi and SigmaUSD.io do not. Not sure which to believe. When I link SigmaUSD.io with that second address the history matches the first address.

hey, I have been trying to make an auction recently, Ive made a few auctions successfully a few days ago but now the transaction keeps failing and getting sent back to me, currently my token is at the auction address sitting there, just waiting for it to return but Ive tried like 3-4 times and everytime the transaction fails, this is the explorer link for the auction https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/addresses/2Bgo5pjW1XN8hC1KLW1Uh1XpSMUpuctKBFkTszHCAVuYA2pW8e9FEzPzoQVBwtKbCrFX9r6fZgWLG2zDxgndxGBAcyZWD4CYb919EHa1no933M9y776kLsKQkHkFe97xkXUGPwyyhDxnRA6JLGVDzj3xMa2TDoTNsSyiPiCmG4vqmrxYoDcWLYYooY1VZpow1zW7MRhqiCdnVirEvfNkhGvUB6mVGfcC4xqAMuq5azKaagkXbzD9nRgGyYxpX4o51untRwy5Ym5NFPQxx


[08/30/2021 2:16 AM] Mlorp#2578
do I need to send it in two separate transactions or is there a way to send both token and erg in one transaction?

[08/31/2021 1:14 PM] ppf#7249
is there an easy way to wipe a wallet (send all funds to a new wallet)? i always run into the input-limit (`boxes exceed max inputs in transaction`)


[08/31/2021 3:04 PM] ppf#7249
also i ran into this: `Failed to sign boxes due to Estimated execution cost 1001721 exceeds the limit 1000000` when I tried to send 100 boxes


[08/31/2021 3:05 PM] ppf#7249
I do not understand how I can calculate the fee, i would have to serialize the tx and then pass the size to the fee-endpoint?


[08/31/2021 4:23 PM] ppf#7249
i sorted my unspent boxes from max value to min and took the sum of the first 50 boxes, sending this sum to another address yields `Failed to find boxes to assemble a transaction`. am I misunderstanding something?

[09/01/2021 5:45 AM] Chris Horticulturalist#2573
I have a problem with Yoroi showing only part of my SigRSV holdings say 1,100 in the select asset drop down box; ergo explorer reveals there's a actually larger balance of 11,100 on the same address. Sending an additional 1,000 increases Yoroi SigRSV balance to 2,100 and Ergo explorer shows 12,100.
Oddly there's an asset I have no idea about called OUROBOROS OMEGA listed under Select asset.

I have resynced the wallet along with removed and restored it...but to no avail. Anyone know how I can fix this & regain access to these inaccessible SigRSV?

that's pretty far behind. there is a fix upcoming for this in the next release

Just a sample of the output that's whizzing by after running the java config command.


[09/03/2021 7:27 PM] andee#4722
it should be receiving and applying modifiers


[09/03/2021 7:28 PM] Winston_1984 ! No DMs#4696
so does it always need to be running?


[09/03/2021 7:28 PM] andee#4722
no, only if you want it fully synced at all times


[09/03/2021 7:29 PM] andee#4722
the node interface should display current height

If you‚Äôre solo mining with that card then you‚Äôll have a very difficult time finding anything. Even if you‚Äôre on a pool, with that card, it‚Äôll likely take a while to earn enough erg to see a payout. You can usually check the pools payout and your miners stats on their website.


[09/05/2021 5:56 PM] ThomasRhombas#7628
Im in a pool


[09/05/2021 7:06 PM] ThomasRhombas#7628
ohhhh my pool has a minimum payout of 1 erg so that must be why it wasnt working


[09/06/2021 5:24 AM] Mxsi/Maciej#1554
Yup, need to mine for couple of days, didnt use t rex, only teamredminer but probably works the same

Hi was withdrawing my ERGO from Kucoin to Yoroi, after 10 minutes it appeared in my Yoroi but then transaction failed


[09/09/2021 5:29 PM] Zeiezee#0876
what happened?


[09/09/2021 5:30 PM] Zeiezee#0876
though in ergo explorer the txhash still says unconfirmed


[09/09/2021 6:00 PM] glasgowm#9381

[09/09/2021 6:02 PM] Quinnt#4533
Yep check the Yoroi board here and also the Ergo support forums...seems that Yoroi isn't synching with the chain


[09/09/2021 6:02 PM] Zeiezee#0876
Ahhh ok, thank you!

guys... i'm having  a trouble with my api keys at ergo's node interface.


[09/10/2021 5:39 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
It shows "bad api key" now. It used to work before. i've already tried to change it but no success... Always bad api key.


[09/10/2021 5:39 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
any clue?


[09/10/2021 5:44 AM] lpsdamaceno#7362
the last thing i've tried just now and seems to solve: remove all block database and resync the node. now i can access the wallet.

I have started an auction but can't see it in the Active Auction page!
Starting an auction is basically waiting for an transaction representing the auction to be mined. Depending on the network traffic, it may take a few minutes for the transaction to be mined and you see your auction. if you keep the app open, you will be notified about the status.


[09/12/2021 4:23 AM] Dacklin#2383
Hey guys it‚Äôs been almost to 2 hours and I can‚Äôt see my auction still


[09/12/2021 6:48 AM] andee#4722

Okay so im looking at the exchange of ergo to BTC on Kucoin as the exchange im using called CEX.io but the fee is $20 for transferring from kucoin to CEX.io, any advice on a cheaper method to turn this ergo into money? I would exchange it into USDT but cex.io says it needs to be on the ethereum network, which would involve quite high gas prices right? Which is what im trying to avoid


[09/13/2021 10:36 PM] KaZaK#4277

Would a PYN5 nvidia quadro p2000 5GB GDDR5 be a good card for mining ? More cad related software card. But thinking of trying to convince a family member to use his computer to mine in evenings ?


[09/14/2021 8:31 AM] KaZaK#4277
According to nicehash, you'll get around 1 euro per day with that card on ETH, so maybe use that as a ballpark figure?


[09/14/2021 8:32 AM] KaZaK#4277
Oh wait thats with the p2200


[09/14/2021 8:33 AM] KaZaK#4277
Theres no real way to know until you try it, but if the p2000 is worse then the p2200 youll be make a very small amount of money

that should do it, yep


[09/16/2021 6:19 PM] Minde#4633
sweet, do you know if it will solve the many many days of active synchronization that i have been having?


[09/16/2021 6:20 PM] ziggomatic#9335
hehe not sure. might do


[09/16/2021 6:21 PM] Minde#4633
well one way to find out i guess. It's been doing my head in seeing it stuck at "Active synchronization" for the past week if not more.


[09/16/2021 6:26 PM] andee#4722
stop node, delete `.ergo/{history,state}`


[09/16/2021 6:26 PM] andee#4722
will have to resync, but it will most likely fix your problem

[09/17/2021 6:03 PM] ziggomatic#9335
it may need a number of confirmations before it accepts

@Dmitry Usov Hi! I have just checked my PR and it has conflict with config.toml file but i believe it's only a new line. Should I resolve that in the github UI in the web or close the PR, pull the repo and merge it locally on my machine?

it is about some additional ERG strangely being sent to another address during a transaction, some kind of "change address" ü§î

[09/19/2021 9:10 PM] Tyreal#2040
thanks, that's helpful to understand what's going on and why 1 ERG went somewhere else during the transaction. How can I get hold of it though? In the node UI I do not see the address the coin went to, setting it up from scratch with a recovered wallet hasn't helped either. I was using ergo-4.0.10.jar before, I have used ergo-4.0.13.jar for the new node. Could this be a problem?


[09/19/2021 9:14 PM] andee#4722
shouldn't be. I don't know why the node would make a change address without showing it in the list of addresses though


[09/19/2021 9:15 PM] andee#4722
you should be able to access it when sending a transaction though


[09/19/2021 9:17 PM] Tyreal#2040
yes, I have actually seen that at a follow up transaction, ERG were sent from the change address. So I think it is a UI problem then, as it would not allow me to send more ERG than available in the primary address. Would setting up a "manual" transaction via Swagger be an option?


[09/19/2021 9:18 PM] Tyreal#2040
but looking at the Swagger route for this seems rather complicated, I am certainly not blockchain pro


[09/19/2021 9:19 PM] andee#4722
try `deriveNextKey` in swagger


[09/19/2021 9:20 PM] andee#4722
it will add an extra address to your wallet


[09/19/2021 9:20 PM] Tyreal#2040
ok will do one sec


[09/19/2021 9:21 PM] Tyreal#2040
that worked


[09/19/2021 9:22 PM] Tyreal#2040
however, weirdly enough it shows the new address twice in the addresses UI


[09/19/2021 9:22 PM] andee#4722
you can also use `/wallet/updateChangeAddress` to change it


[09/19/2021 9:22 PM] Tyreal#2040
will it transfer the ERG held by the current change address to the new one?


[09/19/2021 9:23 PM] andee#4722
no, not until you do a transaction and get change in return


[09/19/2021 9:24 PM] Tyreal#2040
I see. thanks for your help. I will try sending some ERG and see what happens. It is good to understand what's going on and know that the ERG is not lost


[09/19/2021 9:45 PM] ikar3m#9402

[09/20/2021 9:50 AM] Tyreal#2040
hey guys, follow up question on my issue with the change address: I am seeing this line in the node's log: `ErgoWalletState - Change address not specified. Using root address from wallet`
how can I specify the change address in the ergo config file? looking through github I found that WalletStorage seems to read it from `change_address`, but it is not clear to me where this key should be set in the config.


[09/20/2021 10:06 AM] andee#4722
you set it using the API


[09/20/2021 10:09 AM] Tyreal#2040
ok, I have tried that. It unfortunately does not make the change address appear in the UI addresses


[09/20/2021 10:10 AM] andee#4722
it won't make it appear, the address you change it to will be set as changeAddress on your transactions


[09/20/2021 10:11 AM] Tyreal#2040
understood


[09/20/2021 10:13 AM] Tyreal#2040
can I use the API route `/scan/addBox`  to make the node aware of ERG stored at the change address?


[09/20/2021 10:18 AM] andee#4722
you should be able to do that. a `/wallet/rescan` should also fix it, request will timeout


[09/20/2021 10:24 AM] Tyreal#2040
thanks, will give it a try


[09/20/2021 10:49 AM] Tyreal#2040
so that actually worked üëç after doing the `/scan/addBox` request, the node was aware of the available balance and I could send it regularly via the UI.
I have a better understanding of the whole transaction/utxo concept in blockchains now. only thing still puzzling is why the node does not recognize the boxes by itself.
thanks for the help!


[09/20/2021 2:26 PM] joshu#5155
I may have posted in the wrong chanel. I've set up the node, and I'm wondering how long the initial sync lasts? It seems to be chewing up system resources while it syncs for the last 15 hours or so.


[09/20/2021 2:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
make sure it's syncing (height is increasing) - depends on computer speed/internet. 12-24hrs

{Reactions}
üëç 

[09/20/2021 3:04 PM] joshu#5155
Yes, the height is increasing. I'll be patient then. Thanks for the expected eta.

Is there instruction for setting up behind a reverse proxy, specifically Nginx? My hope is to cloud host and secure this with keycloak. I was able to achieve a basic proxy, but the api key would not set.


[09/20/2021 3:19 PM] andee#4722

[09/20/2021 8:03 PM] joshu#5155
I'm supposed to use bindAddress in the config. I see 2 instances of this, scorex.restapi.bindaddress and network.bindaddress.

however regardless of how I set these it fails in a dozen ways. any guidance on the config file here? I feel like I'm missing something.


[09/20/2021 8:08 PM] andee#4722
what fails?


[09/20/2021 8:12 PM] joshu#5155
I'm binding to 127.0.0.3 with the ports respectively.

with only proxy_pass set to the same string and no other settings enabled it redirects to /swagger fr base url, but nginx gives 404


[09/20/2021 8:22 PM] joshu#5155
where can I find the actual locations for the port calls? eg, root url is clearly 9052. Is there a specific location that calls to 9020?


[09/20/2021 8:23 PM] joshu#5155
when I specifically set the port in nginx, it brings up swagger and panel.


[09/20/2021 8:23 PM] joshu#5155
but... I cannot set api key.


[09/20/2021 8:41 PM] andee#4722
the other port is for p2p communication between nodes


[09/20/2021 8:41 PM] andee#4722
you need to do `proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1;` and append the port to the url


[09/20/2021 9:06 PM] joshu#5155
in your example it is explained that it worked only after removing the port...?


[09/20/2021 9:07 PM] andee#4722
no port in nginx config


[09/20/2021 9:07 PM] andee#4722
but when accessing the node you need to use the port


[09/20/2021 9:07 PM] andee#4722
`http://server:port`


[09/21/2021 3:13 PM] DetroitIrish25#8815
Having issues restoring wallet. !fresh node install on new nachine.correct mnemonic and pass shows 0 balance and new address. Imported .json from backup (/wallet/keystore)and cleared history yields correct address but still 0 balance. Any help would be appreciated. I can see the correct balance if install Yoroi  and use same 15 char mnemonic and pass


[09/21/2021 3:26 PM] glasgowm#9381
is the node sync'd ?


[09/21/2021 3:28 PM] DetroitIrish25#8815
It has sync'd


[09/21/2021 3:28 PM] glasgowm#9381

[09/21/2021 3:28 PM] DetroitIrish25#8815
I backed everything up to a USB, can I just overwrite the wallet section?


[09/21/2021 3:29 PM] glasgowm#9381
should be fine yeah


[09/21/2021 3:29 PM] DetroitIrish25#8815
As of last night the height matched


[09/21/2021 3:30 PM] DetroitIrish25#8815
Anything else need to be done other than empty history?


[09/21/2021 3:30 PM] glasgowm#9381
If you use yoroi and send all assets into one box that might help


[09/21/2021 3:30 PM] glasgowm#9381
For what ?


[09/21/2021 3:30 PM] DetroitIrish25#8815
When I over write wallet


[09/21/2021 3:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
History and state are the sync I believe


[09/21/2021 3:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
It's just /wallet


[09/21/2021 3:31 PM] DetroitIrish25#8815
I don't use Yoroi, just downloaded to verify mnemonic was working correctly


[09/21/2021 3:32 PM] glasgowm#9381
I'm guessing your funds are in multiple addresses on yoroi?


[09/21/2021 3:32 PM] DetroitIrish25#8815
Single address


[09/21/2021 3:33 PM] glasgowm#9381
First check console for error messages etc.. if that doesn't help then reinitialize as follows
1. Fresh folder, don't copy any old data
2. Init wallet with mnemonic
3. Derive address while node is syncing
4. Wait for sync

Hi. Any ideas on how to fix "Bad API key" error? I believe I'm entering the correct one (I just copy+paste the one that I've used for the last few months, including a few transactions last week). Updating from 4.0.12 to 4.0.13 didnt help


[09/21/2021 5:52 PM] luisriverag#0773
Sorted. Seems I just had to remove .ergo folder and sync again (I renamed it just to play safe). Thanks anyway!


[09/22/2021 7:47 AM] Bickleigh#8948
Hi guys, reaching out here for some help. I have an account with Bitcoin.com which I use as a proxy for Binance because Binance don't support ERGO. I have a couple of rig's mining on Herominers. I mine about 3 erg every 24hours and it is deposited into the Bitcoin.com account where it is converted to $ and then transfered to my Binance account. It has bee running smoothly for the last month. Last night, Herominer made a deposit of about 3 erg as usual, but it never arrived in my Bitcoin.com wallet.  I have a transaction ID and can see the entry in the ERGO explorer. I understood the deposits to bitcoin.com were received after 30 confirmations. This transaction is currently sat at 180 confirmations and counting. Not sure what to do here can't contact Bitcoin.com support. (thier contact system is broken, conveniently) and I have a transaction that has gone AWOL. Can anyone help?


[09/22/2021 8:11 AM] glasgowm#9381
Mining straight to exchanges can cause the wallet to break like this. Bitcoin.com are in the middle of some changes so most likely need to wait til their support system is back.


[09/22/2021 10:07 AM] Bickleigh#8948

sounds like a corrupted DB - send logs to kushti and then delete and restart - I think there's a reward if it leads to catching any of the edge cases causing this.

I don't know of any tools available for testing if it works, but you could always write one. plenty of password generators available

Anyone had the same problem with PICO?

Rig turning on (CPU & GPU fan spinning, and LED indicators turning on) but no display in monitor nor beep code using PICO board. Seller said it is possible that the PICO board is not compatible with my motherboard.

Also how much does a transaction usually take


[10/10/2021 8:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
yes


[10/10/2021 8:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
depends where to. 2m blocktime


[10/10/2021 8:00 PM] Stef#0241

[10/10/2021 8:00 PM] Stef#0241
However ergodex is giving me problems


[10/10/2021 8:25 PM] Stef#0241
It doesn't say transaction submitted


[10/10/2021 8:27 PM] glasgowm#9381
see discord server in #deleted-channel - you might need to refund it if the price changed too much

Yeah I'm in that server aswell


[10/10/2021 8:43 PM] Stef#0241
I managed to get the transaction processing but after a while I just got the erg back minus the fees


[10/10/2021 8:43 PM] Stef#0241
So the contract didn't go through?

The desktop wallet/node desperatly needs a complete UI/workflow makeover. I did get it up and running but I don't have time to tinker and tweak just to make it work. Desktop wallet i feel is required in order to get adoption. Desktop wallet with ledger support, now THERE is Utopia for ya! üôÇ Is that on the roadmap at all?


[10/18/2021 3:43 PM] glasgowm#9381
Not with ledger yet afaik but there's a couple different teams who are working on multiplatform wallets and armeanio is speaking to people at existing wallet solutions

I am trying to restore my Yoroi Wallet and for some reason it is only bringing back one address which I have used and that address was used to transfer only 34 ERG. All the rest of my ERG doesn't look to be coming through when restoring. Can anyone advise at all please?


[10/21/2021 7:47 PM] apexpool#3878
they don't appear when you click "Generate new address" in the "Receive" tab?


[10/21/2021 7:51 PM] RH#8045
hey buddy, do you if if we can call about this so I can explain it a little better? I'm just stressing a little right now @apexpool


[10/21/2021 7:53 PM] apexpool#3878
I am not an expert in Yoroi / ERG


[10/21/2021 7:53 PM] apexpool#3878
if you go to "Receive" tab and click on "Generate new address" it should generate the same addresses as you had before.


[10/21/2021 7:54 PM] apexpool#3878
if not.... I cannot help


[10/21/2021 7:55 PM] RH#8045
I cannot see that part as I removed the wallet so I need to restore it back first before I can view all the addresses etc. But when I need to verify the restoration of the wallet it only shows 1 address and i click on it and it takes me to ERGO Explorer where it only shows I have 34 ERG


[10/21/2021 7:56 PM] apexpool#3878
but you did not click on what I said 2 times, "Generate new address". try that after you restore the wallet.


[10/21/2021 7:59 PM] RH#8045
but I'm worried because if I restore the address now it might only bring through 34 ERG


[10/21/2021 8:00 PM] RH#8045
because it is only showing 1 address where I used multiple different addresses to transfer my ERG into my wallet but for one reason I can only see 1


[10/21/2021 8:00 PM] apexpool#3878
should I say again for the third time the same thing?


[10/21/2021 8:02 PM] RH#8045
I cannot do what you are telling me because I need to restore my wallet for me to be able to click 'generate new address'


[10/21/2021 8:02 PM] RH#8045
if my wallet isn't restored I cannot do what you are telling me


[10/21/2021 8:02 PM] apexpool#3878
restore the wallet and do that.


[10/21/2021 8:03 PM] RH#8045
but I am worried because if I restore my wallet will I lose a big chunk of my ERG?


[10/21/2021 8:03 PM] RH#8045
because it is only showing 1 address on the restore


[10/21/2021 8:03 PM] apexpool#3878
restoring a wallet does not affect what is in your wallet.

This is probably a noob question, but I've created an ergo node (finished synching) and used that adress to recieve mining rewards. I can even confirm the transactions been paid out (and recieved)
But balance still show 0? 
Anyone know what's going on?
 
I've read somewhere that a certain number of transactions need to be maid before balance shows, is this correct or have I misinterpreted?


[10/25/2021 4:55 PM] andee#4722
you node is probably not synced

Hello. Long time lurker...first time poster. Can someone break down pros/cons of mining Ergo for someone like me who has zero experience/expertise?

Im willing to invest around $5000US for a dedicated mining rig if I think it's something i could handle.

Hello, 

others including me had problems with verification and been stuck in verification channels for some days. 

Now it seems that some admin or moderator has taken care of the situation. 

Whoever this was, thank you very much! We were a bunch of people who all wanted to join the community but were stuck for longer.

Thank you for solving this‚úåÔ∏è

it's pinned in the #‚õè‚îÇmining channel


[10/27/2021 7:50 PM] apexpool#3878
1080ti is ok, much better than 1050ti


[10/27/2021 7:51 PM] apexpool#3878
but you will still need many days for 1 ERG


[10/27/2021 7:52 PM] apexpool#3878
not so many, maybe 4-6 days.


[10/27/2021 7:53 PM] apexpool#3878
depending on current difficulty.


[10/27/2021 7:53 PM] hellyea#2223
Oh damn


[10/27/2021 7:53 PM] hellyea#2223
So I will basically use more electricity


[10/27/2021 7:53 PM] hellyea#2223
Instead


[10/27/2021 7:53 PM] apexpool#3878
it depends, but it is not impossible.


[10/27/2021 7:54 PM] apexpool#3878
with 1050ti, it is very likely.


[10/27/2021 7:54 PM] hellyea#2223
Can you tell me about this?

it is probably ok, but maybe expensive.


[10/27/2021 7:59 PM] hellyea#2223

I have no idea if it is expensive or not. 
I would not buy anything below 3060ti to mine. but they are expensive now...


[10/27/2021 8:01 PM] apexpool#3878
I believe the price is ok


[10/27/2021 8:01 PM] apexpool#3878
if the electricity is not expensive, it's probably ok.


[10/27/2021 8:01 PM] hellyea#2223
It‚Äôs 207 dollar


[10/27/2021 8:02 PM] hellyea#2223
My electricity rate is 0.06 KW/per hour


[10/27/2021 8:02 PM] apexpool#3878
it's a good price, I guess, for the card.


[10/27/2021 8:03 PM] hellyea#2223
So it will be mineable right


[10/27/2021 8:03 PM] apexpool#3878
yes. you can see in the spreadsheet.


[10/27/2021 8:03 PM] hellyea#2223

Don‚Äôt want to burn up entire gpu or pc


[10/27/2021 8:04 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, it will be good for mining, but don't expect too many ergo with it.


[10/27/2021 8:04 PM] hellyea#2223
It‚Äôs ok I will use unmineable


[10/27/2021 8:04 PM] hellyea#2223
Or nicehash maybe


[10/27/2021 8:04 PM] hellyea#2223
Heard they are good for low spec gpu


[10/27/2021 8:05 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, they are.


[10/27/2021 8:05 PM] apexpool#3878
and it's probably very good for gaming, too


[10/27/2021 8:05 PM] hellyea#2223
Other than Ergo what other coins will be easier to mine?


[10/27/2021 8:05 PM] hellyea#2223

Is it a good idea?


[10/27/2021 8:26 PM] apexpool#3878
if you can put a 1080 ti in it, yes. but many of the branded PCs cannot be upgraded, you have to be sure it has a mainboard with a PCI Express slot and that the case is big enough for the 1080 ti card.

[11/07/2021 1:37 PM] Kaufi#6036
Hello a few days ago I sent all my assets in this tx: 0cb064c6307a02ad2afe37f9492b3723f83da84d0bb5ba4a1c6c468d5e62c1ce to another wallet but the erdoge I have held at this address: 0cb064c6307a02ad2afe37f9492b3723f83da84d0bb5ba4a1c6c468d5e62c1ce somehow went lost.


[11/07/2021 1:37 PM] Kaufi#6036
What can I do to get them back?


[11/07/2021 1:43 PM] glasgowm#9381

[11/07/2021 1:46 PM] hellyea#2223
Fixed it. It was called Tara wallet, I reinstalled it.


[11/07/2021 1:46 PM] hellyea#2223
Weird didn‚Äôt find any ‚ÄúTara‚Äù info anywhere


[11/07/2021 1:47 PM] glasgowm#9381
I've never heard of Tara Wallet


[11/07/2021 1:47 PM] glasgowm#9381

[11/07/2021 1:47 PM] hellyea#2223
I will give screenshot when i reach home


[11/07/2021 1:48 PM] hellyea#2223
It wasn‚Äôt even Ergo


[11/07/2021 1:48 PM] hellyea#2223
But it got so much cool options


[11/07/2021 1:48 PM] hellyea#2223
Much better than Ergo and ADA wallet


[11/07/2021 1:48 PM] hellyea#2223
Not sure how I came to that lol


[11/07/2021 1:49 PM] hellyea#2223
@glasgowm Also how do I check all my tokens and coins using my address? Because on one of my PC yoroi shows I have 240 Erdoge, and another pc shows I have only 70 Erdoge. Resynced wallet, re installed the wallet, still same issue.

@glasgowm Can you help me? I had 240 Erdoge, but it's showing 84 Erdoge now? How do I exactly check I really have all the Erdoge in my wallet?


[11/08/2021 5:49 AM] bonfiggy#3939
can anyone help me with a failed nft listing by chance? I sent the erg and nft to the address for my listing and they both got confirmed etc but it didnt seem to make it to the auction house?

Hi, i using 2miners. I see those and what is the difference with ERG- 2miners ERG and Beam - 2miners Beam. Does it affect Profit??

[11/10/2021 7:45 AM] apexpool#3878
erg and beam are different coins and blockchains. 2miners offers mining pools for both coins.


[11/10/2021 10:44 AM] KeremD#9444
I mean whose. Looks like 2Miners BEAM is more profitable but how?

[11/10/2021 11:13 AM] apexpool#3878
what do you mean, how? mining each coin will have a different profitability.


[11/10/2021 11:29 AM] KeremD#9444
BEAM and 2Miners BEAM aren't same coin?


[11/10/2021 11:30 AM] apexpool#3878
Beam is a coin and a blockchain, 2miners beam is a mining pool where miners can mine the Beam coin and secure the Beam blockchain.


[11/10/2021 11:38 AM] KeremD#9444
@apexpool Yes i agree with you but if you look my first screenshot, i can choise different BEAMs. What is the purpose i selected already using 2miners pool. So Why i can select BEAM - 2Miners as a coin section? You can see this in the photo. Both selected 2miners pool already. I'm asking this because of minerstat calculator says BEAM - 2Miners more profitable almost %30 (see 2. Photo) . I don't believe this but i still wanna to ask

An Issue With Change address of Node Wallet
A lot of complaints were given on a change address to be used which is not shown in the node (but balance is correct, at least, after rescan). Affected version are 4.0.13 - 4.0.15.  Since very early versions, Ergo node used root secret key (derived from seed) for change address. After switching to EIP-3, supported by CoinBarn and Yoroi around th...

what do you mean by stuck ?


[11/10/2021 10:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
You need other tokens/nfts to mix with - which isn't possible for NFTs. I think @anon2020s has to manually refund them.

This is an address to a hop i created in the ergo mixer on ergoutils website


[11/11/2021 10:50 AM] misosoup#3130
This is another problem I have, but it is in a different hop


[11/11/2021 10:57 AM] misosoup#3130
Basically, I have created a hop and used this to withdraw from Kucoin.  I have done this in the past and it worked fine so it's not due to this.  What I mean by stuck is that, the tokens that have been sent to the hop address did not make it through all the "steps", and thus has not made it to the intended receiving address.

so i wouldnt put my main wallet into ergo faucet right? i should make a yoroi nightly wallet and then transfer ergo into that and sign that up to the ergofaucet correct? still learning how to use ergDeX and its fucking siiick

you dont connect the faucet to your wallet, you enter your address and get sent tokens


[11/13/2021 12:11 AM] Salu#0001
really? so i can just set my test wallet to be sent tokens, for any and all the offered tokens? theres no limit?

Hi, every time I put my receiving address into ergonfts.org it just pulls up a message that there are no tokens. When I check yoroi, it's all there so I'm not sure what the problem is


[11/13/2021 6:06 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Check your 'receive' tab then find 'has balance' on the bottom left. Your NFTs could be in any one of those addresses

huh? Nightly was likely just behind since it's still in beta - need to refresh it often.

[11/17/2021 3:01 PM] glasgowm#9381
Look on explorer, yoroi is just an interface. Send all assets just consolidates boxes and speeds it up.

My old wallet had X tokens (pic above) after resyncing the token reduced (pic above). Made a new Ergo wallet. Hoping that my lost tokens would come together. So sent entire Ergo with tokens to the new wallet. Got only the resynced amount, not all.

Hello, I used to mine on the pool some time ago and left some ergos because the amount was not sufficient to transfer to my wallet, but now these ergos are gone, how can I retrieve them? @Ergonaut_Alpha

[11/20/2021 1:34 PM] andee#4722
did you receive a lot of small transactions? looks like it could be a problem with the size of the transaction. also, 1ERG is a lot even for large transactions


[11/20/2021 1:36 PM] andee#4722
try sending e.g 30ERG in two transactions. if you need to send 60ERG to a contract, just send 30ERG x2 to yourself first to consolidate utxo's.


[11/20/2021 1:39 PM] vanZz#1631
Ha okay that worked I just tried 2 x 30 ERG instead


[11/20/2021 1:39 PM] vanZz#1631
Does the fee need to scale with the amount to send?


[11/20/2021 2:32 PM] andee#4722
fee is dependent on the size of the transaction. if you send 60ERG and the transaction uses 60 x 1ERG inputs the transaction will need a ton of extra bytes in the block compared to 1 x 60ERG as input


[11/20/2021 2:33 PM] andee#4722
1ERG fee is a lot even for a transaction of maximum size though

I'm trying to run a node - it's been quite a learning experience thus far. I've begun to sync with mainnet, but the link from ergo platform to compute my hash is inoperable atm, or maybe out of date / obsolete. Have not been successful in solving this by myself yet. Emotional support would appreciated, and technical support even more so


[11/21/2021 10:45 PM] andee#4722
the API endpoint is correct, are you by any chance running the node on a different computer?

No

I can't see my NFT's in my wallet. can anyone help? I've looked through my transactions and couldn't find any trace of them leaving my wallet, I've used all of my different addresses and put them in ergonfts.org - nothing, nothing in my assets in Yoroi.


[11/24/2021 3:43 AM] owlt#4164

@Community Developer @glasgowm 

 @owlt is having a strange issue  ( please correct me if I'm incorrect @owlt )
They recovered their wallet (from seed phrase) to the Via Wallet and when they performed a "Send All" it appears that it was able to move everything but for some reason there's something wrong with pulling the information from that wallet address from the explorer or api calls. 

Here's is one of their missing tokens:
https://ergotokens.org/#/?token=8243482f8b6c9bbbd4258c2d59dae970440cfa676f854c3156d33380f36a010f

Here is the transaction which they sent their wallet contents through and the receiving wallet appears as though it should have many things inside but that wallet appears empty by all accounts.
https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/d2b092583f62c0c558ddd44f58c05486263758851b4ba40a22d205e492d6d556

Here is the last transaction where that address seems to have held the contents in question:
https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/e62920edbebe5d20364fd997f0d354e026110ee30ab6091c38508febe9ccdb36 

but there's nothing in the transaction that indicates that the contents shouldn't be in that wallet afterwards.

I'm not sure if I'm not reading this correctly but I would appreciate if someone else could take a look.

It seems like it was able to send all the NFTs to a smart contract that didn't know how to handle them and so it didn't fail but didn't send either.


[11/24/2021 6:13 AM] Luivatra#9076
Via wallet doesnt support tokens, does it?


[11/24/2021 7:32 AM] Luivatra#9076
@owlt @EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV Look here, this tx has the boxes with all the tokens as input, but none of the output boxes have tokens. Does that mean they are burned?

On testnet I also lost tokens in one wallet but not another that I have been actively using lately.  I didn't dig in much...since it was testnet but I'll dig around more and see if I can learn more

[11/24/2021 7:47 AM] Luivatra#9076
there is no unspent box with that token in it, which basically means it is burned I guess (I am not knowledgeable in burning)

hi (im NB, and i dont really know where to post it, sorry if isnt the place):


a strange thing happened yesterday during my auction.
I received a bid of 21 ERG and there were 43 minutes to end.

the auction was closed for 19 ergos, being that it was already at 21 and with time remaining.

can someone help me understand what might have happened? is there anyone i can talk to?

I have all the prints. even the buyer who bid for 21 ergos contacted me to understand what had happened.

I downloaded Via Wallet and restored using my seedphrase to bid on some NFTs while I was out of town, so maybe when I sent my first bid it also sent over all my assets to another address in Via Wallet? the reason I bring this up is because I wasn‚Äôt able to see almost all of my ERG in Yoroi, but I was able to see it in Via Wallet.


[11/24/2021 1:54 PM] owlt#4164

Node is up to the tip of the chain (based on "bestHeaderId"), but the sychronization is only on like block 100,000.  I'm guessing the node is validating the blocks.  Is there a way to speed this up, or do I just need to wait it out?


[12/01/2021 5:37 AM] wileyyy#7785
My node stops running after the initial script is done executing in the command prompt.  Is this part of the .conf file supposed to have my directory or is the ${} a java thing to get it itself?

Looks like you are not syncing, delete .ergo/{history,state} and start over


[12/01/2021 1:38 PM] andee#4722
Check node output to confirm it‚Äôs syncing, it should show ‚Äònew height xxx‚Äô etc


[12/01/2021 1:51 PM] apexpool#3878
doing it now.


[12/01/2021 2:25 PM] apexpool#3878
it's syncing now, about half already done, by the current height.


[12/01/2021 2:45 PM] andee#4722
First part is pretty fast as it‚Äôs just headers, make a copy of the db when finished syncing (with node shutdown) in case it corrupts later


[12/01/2021 2:45 PM] apexpool#3878
I will.


[12/01/2021 2:47 PM] apexpool#3878
are there any tools similar to cardano-cli (in case you know it), to be able to do command line transactions (to manually select the address and USxOs where to send funds from)?


[12/01/2021 4:09 PM] andee#4722
you can do it using the API, other than that I only know of ergo-tool

Basic question: I have both Yoroi and Yoroi Nightly, but only the latter can interact with ErgoDex.  Is there any reason to keep Yoroi as well, or does Nightly function the same in all respects?


[12/04/2021 4:46 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, to use it as your main wallet, for example.


[12/04/2021 5:37 PM] boostopasta#7196
By this do you mean keeping my assets off Nightly unless I will be using them to interact with the dex?


[12/04/2021 5:38 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, that would be an option.

Yes thats normal, smart contract addresses can be very long. Usually you can just click on the address text and it will be automatically copied to your clipboard. From there you can paste it into a wallet of your choice and send the ERG.

[12/10/2021 5:45 PM] Flaxen#1974
Hi guys, I also posted this on the forums but I will post here as well for some visibility, I hope thats ok


[12/10/2021 5:46 PM] Flaxen#1974
Hi everyone,

I have worked hard to try to accrue as much ergo I could reasonably afford and I was always concerned with security, because evidently everything can be hacked one way or the other, so i have set up a ergo full node on my secondary machine. Yes, my probable mistake was to put everything on windows ‚Ä¶

Recently I have made a few small transactions from the full node wallet to my yoroi wallet. 1 and 2 ergos.
Within those transactions I saw that there are some additional addresses in there, but checking my ergo node wallet, the numbers didn‚Äôt add up.

On the explorer it was clearly stated, that I have 97.1913 ergos, when on the ergo node wallet it was clearly said that I have ~236 so i didn‚Äôt think of it.

Yesterday, I decided to create a more secure place for my ergo wallet on a VM, when I decided to move everything, I kept getting an error, I couldn‚Äôt even move a single ERG out of the wallet (error was ‚ÄúTransaction with this ID was not found, or it has not entered Mempool yet‚Äù.

As I found this strange I decided to investigate, so in the CLI it said ‚ÄúFailed to initialize storage: org.fusesource.leveldbjni.internal.NativeDB$DBException: Corruption: CURRENT file does not end with newline.‚Äù

To fix this, I renamed the history and state folders so i can start to completely re-sync. Once the sync was complete, to my horror, it was no longer showing me 236 ERG, but 97.1913.

Once I checked the transactions on the explorer, it was there, clear as day, another address, within my 1-2 ERG transactions, with way higher values.


[12/10/2021 5:46 PM] Flaxen#1974
To date, 130 ERG are missing. I do not know this address, I checked every single exchange that I used, it is not any of them. This address, currently holds what used to be my 130 ergos.

Before posting the addresses, funny thing is, I always TRIPLECHECK every single transaction, to make sure the fields are only populated by the addresses where I want to send, scroll left and right to make sure there is nothing else in the address fields. Yet somehow, if it turns out that this was injected somehow, those transactions were made.

Is it possible at all to validate my claims? I still have 97 ergos in there that i would like to get out, but if every time I do a transaction there is a way to inject another address ‚Ä¶ its basically gone before I may even have a chance to salvage what is left.

My main wallet address: 9hUVScrWS5MMS9bLxabg8jiuTTuWMtq4Tswo6cyfTiJZkPTsXoX
My Yoroi: 9gJmMAAQq8PLNskKKF5FSJ3GfauT3KZ27R5AHxvscN1n2txx8oP
The suspect address: 9efMs56kANdn9udDDnW6xYHjD2U1pscu3q4fYSpybXw6ooXk5rQ

I appreciate any feedback anyone might have.
This burns my heart to no avail ‚Ä¶ I tried to be so careful.


[12/10/2021 6:40 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Is the address in question making more transactions to other addresses or is it an isolated address with only transactions from your other address in the ledger history?


[12/10/2021 6:41 PM] Flaxen#1974
It seems it is isolated with only transactions from my main addr


[12/10/2021 6:43 PM] liquid_phase#4605
First tx 00:30:35, 16.10.2021 - 2 months ago. Does the timing correlate to you setting up your node?


[12/10/2021 6:43 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Follow up question, I haven‚Äôt used node but does it allow you to create a receiving address on the node like ergo mixer can?


[12/10/2021 6:44 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Follow up question, are you sendin Tokens like NFT or just erg


[12/10/2021 6:51 PM] Flaxen#1974
The node was set up at the first transaction 12:35:03 24.05.2021


[12/10/2021 6:52 PM] Flaxen#1974
the first transaction towards the suspected account is 09:30:35 16.10.2021


[12/10/2021 6:53 PM] Flaxen#1974
that 5,1 was sent to tradeogre, I haven't noticed the additional transaction, as mentioned in my original text, the wallet from the node reflected exactly my transactions (5,1 in this case, for example)


[12/10/2021 6:53 PM] Flaxen#1974
I am only using it for ERG, nothing else, no other assets


[12/10/2021 6:54 PM] Flaxen#1974
The node allows creation of additional addresses


[12/10/2021 6:55 PM] Flaxen#1974
since the node reflected only my transactions, 5.1, 1, 2 and 1 ERG sent


[12/10/2021 6:55 PM] Flaxen#1974
the balance on the node would go down only by the above amounts


[12/10/2021 7:22 PM] andee#4722
what version node are you running? that address is your change address, so the erg is still in your possession


[12/10/2021 7:23 PM] andee#4722
if you are not running the latest version, try upgrading and see if it adds the address. there was a fix regarding change address


[12/10/2021 7:24 PM] Flaxen#1974
It is slightly outdated 4.0.10.0


[12/10/2021 7:24 PM] andee#4722
there was a change address fix in 4.0.16


[12/10/2021 7:24 PM] Flaxen#1974
This would correlated the amounts being transferred


[12/10/2021 7:26 PM] Flaxen#1974
Allright, I'll update the node. Just for my refference, replacing the .jar would update the rest?


[12/10/2021 7:26 PM] Flaxen#1974
admitedly i could of done a better job of reading the changelogs and documentation


[12/10/2021 7:26 PM] andee#4722

[12/10/2021 7:27 PM] Flaxen#1974

[12/10/2021 7:36 PM] Flaxen#1974
Right, new version is reporting a corruption, 12 missing files from the objects folder, I assume I need to re-sync the node


[12/10/2021 7:36 PM] Flaxen#1974
trying that


[12/11/2021 12:17 PM] Flaxen#1974
Awesome, after updating the node and running a re-sync, I had to rescan the wallet, but once that was done, all the ergos showed up! It seems in the end, I was my own bad actor by being ignorant. Its interesting to see how my paranoid mind went straight to "i was hacked". Live and learn. Thanks for all the help guys!

i have a full mainnet node on the same machine and all the api calls to 9053 work fine


[12/12/2021 1:17 PM] musclesonvacation#7366
ok, tried 9053 worked, then flipped back to 9052 and it worked


[12/12/2021 1:23 PM] musclesonvacation#7366
stop the daemon, start daemon. back to ``Miner has not started yet``


[12/12/2021 1:25 PM] musclesonvacation#7366
maybe i need to wait 5-10mins after starting node for miner to start on testnet?

If its failing, it's probably due to it being close to the oracle refresh which happens every 12 minutes, just try again once it refunds!

After syncing headers you can use `node:port/info` , `headersHeight - fullHeight` is how many blocks are left to sync

no time estimate available, made a script to do it but it was jumping all around the place


[12/21/2021 8:42 AM] Massaker#4565
Hi, was looking to setup a node and the github page suggest running ergo-installer.sh script.
```curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ergoplatform/ergo/master/ergo-installer.sh | sh -s -- --api-key=<YOUR_API_KEY>```
I'm lost when it asks for <YOUR_API_KEY>   (where, how, do i get this?)


[12/21/2021 9:08 AM] apexpool#3878
you generate it in the node web interface, if I remember correctly.


[12/21/2021 9:11 AM] Massaker#4565
weird (to have the node web interface.  that would mean i already have the node installed)


[12/21/2021 9:12 AM] Massaker#4565
maybe this argument creates an api key?  instead of asking for one then? idk


[12/21/2021 9:14 AM] andee#4722
for the installer script, replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with the actual password you want to use

[12/21/2021 9:16 AM] Massaker#4565
am i the only one who thinks that's seems likes its it requesting an api key instead of creating one.

    # unless permanent penalty is applied
    penaltySafeInterval = 20.seconds

Latency issue?


[12/21/2021 2:48 PM] andee#4722
there has been sync problems caused by a seed node running 4.0.17, adding those settings will make sure it gets blacklisted before it crashes your node


[12/21/2021 2:49 PM] andee#4722
from my understanding it was fixed, but looks like its still going on


[12/21/2021 2:50 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Just added. Will let you know in 5.. Usually crashes by then


[12/21/2021 2:52 PM] HelixEvo#2120
It was fine up until about 260k block height, then started with this behaviour.

I just made the first transfer from the yoroi browser addon wallet. It appears on the blockchain, 5 erg to  destination address, 0.0011 fee to some random address, and the transaction also contains a 0.249 to my own wallet address (where it was sent from). Why is this ?


[12/21/2021 4:09 PM] Huginn#2291
that's how utxo works I asume, you just burned one box ov 5.2501 ERG and it got split into 3 boxes of 5, 0.249 and 0.0011 ERG


[12/21/2021 4:10 PM] voidwalker#1983
ohhh, I had no idea.. what's this "box" thing ?


[12/21/2021 4:11 PM] Huginn#2291
it's how utxo works, let me find one recent article talking about it might help you understand.

Initially syncing a node.. Seems the logs look good, but the block height on the ERGO node interface is not increasing the block height number. Best Block ID also showing as changing, so its ticking along.. Any ideas why block height not updating


[12/22/2021 12:41 AM] glasgowm#9381
The headers need to sync first - once the the headers reach the current height the blocks will start.


[12/22/2021 12:41 AM] glasgowm#9381
Check the info pane @ http://localhost:9053/info


[12/22/2021 12:49 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Does it sync batches at a time then? As it‚Äôs currently in the 277k heights.


[12/22/2021 12:51 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Will it do say 277k - 300k headers next say, so the block height stays at 277k until the 300k header is downloaded


[12/22/2021 12:51 AM] glasgowm#9381
no it should update dynamically throughout


[12/22/2021 12:51 AM] glasgowm#9381
what are the values for `height` and `headersHeight`


[12/22/2021 1:15 AM] HelixEvo#2120

Is there an easy way to clear down files so you can start sync from scratch?


[12/22/2021 2:50 PM] glasgowm#9381
Delete the `.ergo/state` and `.ergo/sync` folder

What are logs saying when it stops working?


[12/22/2021 2:52 PM] glasgowm#9381
You can use `tail -Fn+0 ergo.log | grep 'ERROR'` to see only the error's - or `tail -Fn+0 ergo.log | grep 'ERROR\|WARN'` for error/warn


[12/22/2021 3:22 PM] andee#4722
is it still shutting down? 4GB ram slows down the sync a lot when node closes in on block 300k

Hi, where can I grab a `mainnet.conf`? I tried to setup a full node in Docker as the Github instructed, but got these error:
```
Exception in thread "main" com.typesafe.config.ConfigException$Missing: /tmp/mainnet.conf: 1: No configuration setting found for key 'ergo.directory'
```


[12/23/2021 3:40 AM] Siegfried#2220
The command was like `sudo docker run --rm -p 9030:9030 -p 127.0.0.1:9053:9053 -v /path/on/host/to/ergo/data:/home/ergo/.ergo ergoplatform/ergo --mainnet`


[12/23/2021 8:31 AM] andee#4722
```sudo docker run -d \
    -p 9030:9030 \
    -p 127.0.0.1:9053:9053 \
    -v /path/on/host/to/ergo/data:/home/ergo/.ergo \
    -v /path/on/host/system/to/myergo.conf:/etc/myergo.conf \
    -e MAX_HEAP=3G \

Couple of mentions of db corruption yesterday. Is there a folder to backup that contains the block files? Just guessing if db corrupt then I guess it‚Äôs a full sync from fresh?


[12/23/2021 10:46 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Regarding full node


[12/23/2021 11:07 AM] andee#4722
history and state


[12/23/2021 11:07 AM] andee#4722
need to shutdown node properly before making a backup


[12/23/2021 11:09 AM] andee#4722
if you have a wallet there its probably best to backup the whole `.ergo` dir


[12/23/2021 11:09 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Running it as systemctl service. Is there a right way to shut it down?


[12/23/2021 11:10 AM] andee#4722
sigint will initiate a proper shutdown


[12/23/2021 11:11 AM] andee#4722
if you use podman/docker add `--stop-signal=SIGINT` to your run command


[12/23/2021 11:12 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Thanks. I‚Äôm not using docker for node currently. The files are precious arnt they. Just had a crash and sync is buggered again.


[12/23/2021 11:12 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Was up to 277k


[12/23/2021 11:14 AM] andee#4722
Were there any penalties or double application of modifiers in logs before it happened?


[12/23/2021 11:15 AM] HelixEvo#2120
I‚Äôll have to check. But the crash was system. Tried using cockpit while it was syncing


[12/23/2021 11:15 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Odd


[12/23/2021 11:16 AM] andee#4722
Oh, that changes things. Yes, sudden loss of power or system crash can cause corruption. This has been an ongoing problem for bitcoin nodes too


[12/23/2021 11:30 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Interesting.. Only crashes the server if mobile used to access cockpit ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Anyways. Will delete state and history folders now and re-try from start


[12/23/2021 11:37 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Weekly backup I guess will suffice..


[12/23/2021 11:58 AM] andee#4722
Depends on what it will be used for, having a backup at +600k height reduces sync time by a long time


[12/23/2021 7:05 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583

Not anything to pinpoint with there. But try adding this within scorex {} in your config ```    network {

    # Misbehaving peer penalty score will not be increased withing this time interval,
    # unless permanent penalty is applied
    penaltySafeInterval = 20.seconds

    # Max penalty score peer can accumulate before being banned

the node causing the problem was blacklisted right before the crash. try changing 20.seconds to 2.seconds


[12/26/2021 11:06 PM] Siegfried#2220
Ok


[12/27/2021 1:47 AM] HelixEvo#2120
I‚Äôve given up for now trying to fully sync a node. Tried a few versions (4.0.16 & 4.0.16.2) along with 8GB mem, 12GB men, Ubuntu 20/Fedora server all using latest Java release. Always seems to bomb out as you get to 400-500k block height. Headers seem to sync fine


[12/27/2021 2:11 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Any reason why logs from node have multiple entries for private IPs in the database? Is there no way to blacklist all private ip classes?


[12/27/2021 2:24 AM] MarantzCube#4825
Same f*!@#$%ing issue. Tried about 10 times on different comps with Ubuntu 18 (4.0.12-4.0.16). But on Windows it was synchronized right from the first try ü§™

[12/27/2021 3:27 AM] MarantzCube#4825
Yeah. For Ubuntu I will wait for release with DB repairing (kushti said somewhere 4.0.17+ maybe). I killed a lot of time while trying, have no more nerves for it. ü§™

[12/27/2021 9:00 PM] HelixEvo#2120
FYI.. I have swapped my Java version out to 11. This seems to have fixed the issues for me. I was using version 17


[12/27/2021 9:57 PM] Siegfried#2220
I think your config deserves to be a good example. After changed to 2.seconds, the Ergo container has been running for almost a day without a crash.


[12/27/2021 10:00 PM] andee#4722
v4.0.17 was just released and should do initial sync without shutting down without those blacklist settings, but great that it worked out! My node crashed every time it connected with the same node that caused your problems


[12/27/2021 10:03 PM] Siegfried#2220
Let me try that.


[12/28/2021 12:57 AM] MarantzCube#4825

use the shutdown command


[12/30/2021 10:33 AM] glasgowm#9381
It happens when the Actor that reads the headers crashes I think. Can happen due to JVM heap overload. Often requires a resync from scratch though unless it manages to fix itself.

@nox071218 Once you restart the node, does it continue to increase the block height sync total or is it stuck? What is block height currently and total height headers showing in http://127.0.0.1:9053/info


[01/05/2022 5:05 AM] HelixEvo#2120
If it continues to start increasing again, then I had a similar issue. Never fully got to the bottom of it, but once fully synced it was fine. Must be some Java crash I was thinking.


[01/05/2022 5:07 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Current version 4.0.19 and Java 11 though does fully work on Linux machine. Just needs hand holding until full sync has been achieved

depending on the signal you use that can result in a corrupt db. sigint will make the node shutdown properly

Hello, I created a token with amount 1000000000 and I have a few questions:
1. I searched the token on ergotokens.org and it shows, but it says "no image-audio token", should there be a logo image there like on Cardano pool.pm shows on tokens for example ? And if yes, how I create a token with an image too, because on ErgoUtils there is no option for it.
2. I want users to be able to buy the token, but there is no trust if all the tokens are in my wallet, what's the workflow here? How can I sell the tokens and eliminate the idea of a rug pull ?
3. Where do I sell them? Can I do this through ErgoDex or there is another option ?

Short story: I'm working with a lot of music artists in my country and I want to create an ecosystem for them to be able to buy, sell nfts, etc. in the first stage, but then I have other ideas to scale, and I want to offer the people who believe in my project the oportunity to help by buying the ecosystem token.


[01/05/2022 8:57 PM] alexandru#0679
Oh, and why the airdrop option is greyed out on ergoutils ? https://ergoutils.org/#/airdrop


[01/06/2022 6:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
1. There's no logo's for tokens - someone was discussing it the other day if you search
2. No way to sell tokens unless you write a smart contract. 
3. Need to wait for ErgoDex to allow custom pools.

Anyone ran Ergo dex bot successfully? please let me know an easy guide how to set it up


[01/08/2022 10:43 AM] Donalddd#2998
I don't know where I should write this so I am writing here.

I made a transaction yesterday from wallet A to wallet B. I am using Yoroi Nightly for wallet A. The transaction seems stuck since yesterday.

I am getting ```Transaction with this ID was not found, or it has not entered Mempool yet```


[01/08/2022 10:46 AM] Donalddd#2998
Is this a problem with the wallet (transaction was never really submitted) or ergo?


[01/08/2022 10:56 AM] glasgowm#9381
Just a glitch in Yoroi, refresh and try again


[01/08/2022 10:57 AM] glasgowm#9381
explorer is what matters


[01/08/2022 10:57 AM] Donalddd#2998
Ok thanks. I will refresh. I just thought to mention it in case there is something else underlying.


[01/09/2022 2:38 PM] Shano#6718
i am having issues with my erg wallet it wont let me send funds i moved from yoroi because it was rubbish but atleast it let me send my money am i missing something?


[01/09/2022 2:46 PM] Shano#6718
dont worry sorted it, doesnt seem to like being sent to gate.io


[01/09/2022 6:40 PM] Donalddd#2998
for me I have problems sending transactions


[01/09/2022 6:48 PM] Œ£otiris#3516
me too, sent some erg from kucoin to yoroi, initially viewed the transaction as unconfirmed on the explorer but now it doesn't show at all


[01/09/2022 6:48 PM] Œ£otiris#3516
been like 3 hours


[01/09/2022 6:49 PM] Donalddd#2998
for me I can't even send from one wallet to another. It can be a yoroi and yoroi nightly issue though.


[01/09/2022 6:49 PM] Donalddd#2998
since I send from yoroi then it never appears on the explorer


[01/09/2022 6:50 PM] Donalddd#2998
does it appear in your address in the explorer?


[01/09/2022 6:50 PM] Œ£otiris#3516
initially yes as unconfirmed, now I can't view it at all


[01/09/2022 6:51 PM] Donalddd#2998
do control shift R to get a refreshed view of your address


[01/09/2022 6:52 PM] Œ£otiris#3516
already done that


[01/09/2022 6:52 PM] Donalddd#2998
I thought it was an Ergo issue, but then I sent some tip to glasgow and it appears on the explorer, not on my wallet though.


[01/09/2022 6:53 PM] Œ£otiris#3516
I'm not worried at all, I'm sure if there's  an issue they'll fix it


[01/09/2022 7:01 PM] Donalddd#2998
I am not worried at all. I am afraid though that this kinda issues will be a barrier for new users to come onboard. Thankfully we will have progress there, many people working on new wallets etc.


[01/09/2022 7:05 PM] Œ£otiris#3516
I'm sure it'll be fixed asap


[01/09/2022 8:00 PM] gorkel#5593
I'm having the exact same issue as you.  sent from Kucoin to yoroi.  showed up in explorer for a while as unconfirmed, now nothing.  the transaction hash also now does not show up in explorer now.


[01/09/2022 8:13 PM] Donalddd#2998

[01/09/2022 9:28 PM] Andrew P#6277
Mine has not


[01/09/2022 9:29 PM] Donalddd#2998
yes it arrived, but it was not a transfer from kucoin. Just between wallets


[01/09/2022 9:33 PM] Andrew P#6277

Hi, I sent Ergo from Kucoin yesterday and it appeared in my Android wallet as "unconfirmed" for about 8hrs but not has gone now without the amount of ergo being added to my balance. Is there something I can do or is this  just a time issues and I just have to wait? Thanks


[01/10/2022 9:59 AM] haiv#2011
hi, I have the same problem with Aresergo. I saw the transaction yesterday. but today it was gone like nothing happened.


[01/10/2022 9:59 AM] haiv#2011
i also sent from Kucoin, but to my Yoroi wallet


[01/10/2022 10:10 AM] glasgowm#9381
There was an issue with KuCoin sending transactions, will be fixed soon.

[01/10/2022 8:00 PM] blackinsecure#3693
it takes a whole while before it does


[01/10/2022 8:00 PM] blackinsecure#3693
advice is to use your seed phrase and recover your wallet using the official Ergo Mobile Wallet


[01/10/2022 8:01 PM] blackinsecure#3693
and leave Yoroi to ADA only


[01/10/2022 8:01 PM] blackinsecure#3693
works much better for both


[01/10/2022 8:01 PM] blackinsecure#3693

I got caught up with the same issue. The transaction ID generated by Kucoin shows as invalid on Explorer. It's been over a day and I don't think that transaction will ever appear. Contacted Kucoin support and they said they will try to resend the coins. Fingers crossed.


[01/11/2022 1:33 PM] llcrypto#3644
Yep I am in the same boat. Transaction was completed in Kucoin with an Ergo Txn ID but it's invalid on explorer. Glad to know this is a Kucoin issue. Fingers cross this will be fixed soon.

I know kucoin withdrawal's are an issue right now, but if it shows as completed on kucoin, do I have to ask their customer support or is that an issue I can resolve with a transaction ID after the issue is cleared up?

I see the answer is Please run with a config: java -jar /opt/ergo/ergo.jar --mainnet mainnet.conf
my question is do I use my own api key and hash and how would I generate the hash? 
Simplest config is :

ergo {
networkType = "mainnet"
}

scorex {

restApi {
// API key == "hello" (without quotes)
apiKeyHash = "324dcf027dd4a30a932c441f365a25e86b173defa4b8e58948253471b81b72cf"

Hi, is there someone I can chat to directly about a wallet issue. In short I tried to consolidate boxes yesterday from mining in Yoroi. Yoroi has since crashed and when I‚Äôve restored the wallet on the mobile app the account is empty‚Ä¶

Don‚Äôt answer any PMs - but you probably need to derive some new addresses. (re @Zeus: Hi, is there someone I can chat to directly about a wallet issue.

You need TestFlight installed then search for it. Waiting on bank account approval before we can get an app store account

That s a good point, but also who has spam as a goal will do it with or without the tool


[01/14/2022 9:22 AM] Donalddd#2998
that's also true. Maybe allowing particular tokens to be accepted in each address could have been a nice addition but I doubt it is possible at this point.

Hope that block assembly comes asap. Since NFT games and dapps are releasing now on Ergo blockchain, we don‚Äôt want to miss out the bids for those NFT‚Äôs.

what's the difference between the two pls? (re @glasgowm: use the mobile wallet - https://ergoplatform.org/en/wallets/)


[01/17/2022 4:21 PM] glasgowm#0000
It won‚Äôt have sync issues for starters and is more secure.


[01/17/2022 4:34 PM] apexpool#3878
I guess it is using different backend servers, not the same ones as Yoroi...

only 9030 and 9053, but different ports already set in the testnet config (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <apexpool> thanks. I see that the mainnet node is using 3 ports, should I change all of them for tes...)


[01/17/2022 4:50 PM] apexpool#3878
thanks. I found the settings for both and I was able to start the node. I also made a copy-paste error, I had in the config nodeType "testnet", but in the startup script "--mainnet", but I found it and fixed it. it is syncing now.


[01/18/2022 2:42 AM] CryptoPesh#0000
Man this is frustrating, anyone get any insights into when this will be fix for Yoori. Wallet still showing still syncing view with 0 Ada. I was hoping to staking for the airdrops.

Cek dm sir üôèüèª (re @kushti_ru: Hard to say atm, will check with pools)


[01/18/2022 6:11 AM] apexpool#3878
you can use any other wallet instead of Yoroi, just recover the wallet using the recovery words in ccvault or typhonwallet or Daedalus (full node). there are other options, too, but I gave you my favorites in the right order.


[01/18/2022 6:44 AM] blackinsecure#3693
Ergo Wallet for Ergo and CCVault for ADA

Yoroi wallet becomes super slow, after generating many address. Even tho my generated address is used, it still takes lots of time for wallet to sync.

Hi, I have a problem at the beginning of making Walt Argo, that is, where should I get the words to enter in the boxes?


[01/20/2022 4:04 AM] wlroque#0000
Forget support aNETA, solve nothing i complained all day there and nothing solve, do not waste time, buy ERG that ta in good price because this is a good project (re @Arohbe: This room is for Ergo support.  The tokens you are looking for is built on Ergo, but not Ergo itself...)


[01/20/2022 4:17 AM] BickusDickus710#9623
Everytime I try and send ergo from one address I always get this as a response 

"Attempt to invoke virtual method 'java.lang.String org.ergoplatform.restapi.client.ErgoTransactionOutput.getBoxId()' on a null object reference"

I am able to send from other wallets. Any ideas? This is from the ergo android wallet

If you are making a new wallet - it will give you the words. You just need to copy and save them. (re @d_Sahhh: Hi, I have a problem at the beginning of making Walt Argo, that is, where should I get the words to ...)

So what do I do if I sent some ERGO and the 'submitted' box on Yoroi Wallet is still doing it's thing a day later?


[01/21/2022 1:40 AM] StevieJay#5425
I sent ERGO to mint some NFTs to test this all out

Am I out of luck and need to do it again?

Im looking for alternatives , maybe better ones than yoroi

No this isn't possible with a crypto wallet (re @Stephen: Whoever u with request from them)


[01/21/2022 8:09 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
No you can't. You need to use your seed phrase and restore the wallet. Also don't answer and DM of someone trying to "help" (re @Bozsdrin0307: Can I request to reset my password?)

Does sigmausd.io work?  Everytime i try to convert sigusd to erg i get a stuck transaction due to low funds in the proxy address.

And do not receive erg back to my address


[01/21/2022 2:25 PM] arkadias#4896
i cant answer on this specifically but u could always try the dex to convert back to erg


[01/21/2022 2:36 PM] glasgowm#9381
You need to send double the fee when sending to sigUSD from mobile wallet - yoroi does it automatically

Nope check ergo.watch


[01/22/2022 8:13 AM] soysor#6001

Any ideas why the conversion is never successful and what I can try? I've tried like 8 times over the last 5 days

Probably busy. Can take 8 times on a good day

[01/22/2022 8:18 AM] glasgowm#9381

How can i get recovery phrase in yoroi wallet? I lost it


[01/23/2022 7:59 AM] glasgowm#0000
You cannot. (re @Agus: How can i get recovery phrase in yoroi wallet? I lost it)


[01/23/2022 8:00 AM] Agus#0000
Then can i sync to yoroi extencion on chrome with only password?


[01/23/2022 8:01 AM] glasgowm#0000
No you need to send it to a new wallet


[01/23/2022 8:05 AM] Agus#0000
In yoroi asset can send a new wallet too?


[01/23/2022 9:22 AM] hellyea#2223
So in the coming future will we expect for fast transactions like 1 - 2 seconds max instead of 1-2 minutes using Ergodex?

Hello, I'm a little confused how Ledger S works with Yoroi. If I have an existing Yoroi wallet and get a Ledger S, I will essentially be creating a new wallet that is linked to the Ledger? If my existing wallet was delegated, I'll have to re-delegate the new Ledger wallet and wait the appropriate amount of epochs, again, before getting rewards in the new Ledger wallet? If I create a Ledger wallet, can the whole process be done with Ledger Live and Yoroi on my phone, or do I still need to use Yoroi on my computer to set it up? Sorry for all the questions, I just want to make sure I understand how it works before purchasing a Ledger S.

[01/23/2022 9:22 PM] Tim_08#0000
is this related to the DDOS, or just yoroi assembly/congestion?

Random info, but if anyone is having odd issues with node and node sync while also running like me Fedora Server and vnic is vmxnet3. Make sure your running esxi 6.5 U1 at a minimum. Else you get weird hangs and I initially thought it was the node before I dug further into the logs

What does the refund link say exactly? If it failed are you sure it left your wallet ?

Yes there's a transaction of it going out but no refund

Refund button just doesn't do anything when you input the address sent from and proxy sent to

I think we‚Äôre at the point with Ergo where introducing the testnet faucet and swapping testnet tokens is just an extra layer of complexity. Do noobs understand that this is a live dex on mainnet? I am on the beach with feet in the sand literally, I can‚Äôt edit your post but maybe you might reconsider simplifying to just restoring/creating in yoroi nightly, sending ergo in, swapping to sigusd or whatever and so on


[01/25/2022 3:32 PM] Attila#3944
Also just from a psychological standpoint saying*THIS IS NOT A SCAM DON‚ÄôT WORRY* usually is a red flag that this is indeed a scam

Hey @glasgowm , I have recently translated the Ergo Manifesto into Slovak. I was wondering, am I eligible for the bounty? Or maybe for the Paper Wallet which I have done as well. I know one guy who did a small translation for SigUSD and he got a little bit of ERGs.

This sounds like a Cardano issue. Yoroi has been poor at synching etc recently. You can use your same set of seed words to restore to another wallet software (or same hardware device)
Wallets use the same seed words. So you'll be looking at the same wallet address through a different window. You probably won't get Daedalus synched in time for epoch end but you might try cc.vault or Nami, I've heard good things from people (re @Steven: Im having synchronization issues with Yoroi on my phone and desktop. Trying to switch staking pools ...)

Hey,

I'm still having issues claiming ERG from SigUSD, still haven't managed to successfully convert any in like 20 transactions now

The last 2 attempts haven't auto-refunded, the tokens are still at the contract addresses (one of them for over a day now)

Is it possible to get a manual refund or something?

Can someone confirm they've been able to exchange SigUSD for ERG recently?


[01/26/2022 7:21 AM] Tchitombam#0000
I have this tx trying to go thru for half a day now. Its still showing "Submitted" on the wallet but there is no trace of it on the blockchain explorer, not even as pending unconfirmed. Any ideas appreciated. Thank u

can see tx going through on ergo.watch so yes

Send proxy address 0.01 erg and refund via link in menu - double the fee when redeeming if your wallet app allows it


[01/26/2022 9:48 AM] soysor#6001
Thanks, my bad didn't see the refund page üòÇ 

I'm trying with yoroi, it appears to be using the default fee instead of doubling it as far as I can see.

I also tried with the ergo mobile wallet by sending `fee * 2` along with the tokens but I'm not sure if that's the correct way to increase the fee


[01/26/2022 9:49 AM] glasgowm#9381
yoroi should work fine - it sends extra by default


[01/26/2022 9:51 AM] soysor#6001
Maybe that's borked? I'm looking at all my failed txs and the fee is `0.0012 ERG` , I done some successful ones a couple of months ago that all have `0.003 ERG` for the fee - all with yoroi


[01/26/2022 9:52 AM] glasgowm#0000
mines say 0.002 ERG


[01/26/2022 9:54 AM] soysor#6001

I was under the impression that the money I put in the liquidity pool was no longer in my wallet but in a smart contract... I put the small amount of liquidity in around November and the wallet has no activity since then, is that expected?


[01/28/2022 11:40 AM] teamslow#0524
I'm also curious -  are messages from somewhere else being relayed to this chat through a bot?  why do so many names have the BOT tag?


[01/28/2022 11:42 AM] glasgowm#9381
yeah it's bridged to telegram.

You should have LP tokens in your assets tab from the dex


[01/28/2022 11:50 AM] teamslow#0524
I do have LP tokens, but t be honest I don't know what to do with them...


[01/28/2022 11:55 AM] glasgowm#9381
Nothing they just represent your stake in the pool. If you redeem you need to send them back


[01/28/2022 12:01 PM] teamslow#0524
if I have stake in the pool shouldnt I see a liquidity position in the ergodex webUI?


[01/28/2022 12:04 PM] teamslow#0524
I didnt think that losing both ends of the liquidity I provided was possible, but again I'm a big noob here and am hoping to learn more so I can understand my risks going forward...


[01/28/2022 12:05 PM] glasgowm#9381
yeah you will you probably just need to refresh yoroi then refresh ergodex


[01/28/2022 12:06 PM] glasgowm#9381
and make sure the right address is selected


[01/28/2022 12:06 PM] teamslow#0524
ok ill do a full yoroi refresh when i get home from work


[01/28/2022 12:06 PM] teamslow#0524
thanks


[01/28/2022 12:07 PM] glasgowm#9381
I mean the refresh button in browser - usually all it takes


[01/28/2022 12:07 PM] teamslow#0524
oh... I tried that a bunch of times- but I didnt do a full resync with yoroi...


[01/28/2022 12:08 PM] glasgowm#9381
ah right well yeh try that next - and making sure right wallet/address is selected

Haven't been able to connect to my yoroi nightly wallet for two days now on the web app. NETA drops today, so I'm trying to get this connected asap.


[01/28/2022 3:08 PM] 6directions#1089
Hello. I started syncing a node yesterday and for about 5 hours things ran without any problems.
Then I started getting intermittent `Java heap errors` that make the node crash.
I found some recommendations in the GitHub issues section of the Ergo repo.
Most of them suggest to run the node with the `-Xmx` parameter set to `3G`.
I have tried that, and a few other values too (4 and 5), but eventually I keep getting the same error.

Is there a recommended value that I haven't tried?


[01/28/2022 3:23 PM] glasgowm#9381
Restore on Android wallet and consolidate your UTXOs (send all funds to your own address)


[01/28/2022 3:24 PM] glasgowm#9381
`3G` is recommended, if it happens continuously probably a corruption


[01/28/2022 3:52 PM] 6directions#1089
Thanks for replying. Corruption of what, and what might I do to resolve it? Or should I should start from scratch?

Anyway, if you didn't receive the agreed reward, please DM me with your address and swap transaction ID, we will compile these and airdrop in a few days when we are certain everyone has been accounted for!

I'll tell you about my experience... if you don't swap them in 5-10 min, don't wait any longer... refound and swap again with 25% slipage and 10 nitro... that was the only way I could

Slippage is how much your price can slip outside the range. So on pools with low liquidity a big order can cause price to change and your order to get stuck

Guys does anyone know why I'm getting a really low hashrate (around half) on ERGO in all the new versions of Nanominer? If I go back to 3.3.6 it's all good but anything past that is halved. Card is 3080ti

@anon_real could you help with not receiving my losing bid back from ergo auction? I sent 100 erg to Foeniculum's privacy gnome on the 28th but have not gotten my bid back. https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/specific/b3b2db9317d10765ce4023dd470d208a141d0411ec02381ecc6489268b5b8e3a
Here is the transaction for the bid.

I see. I'm not a dev, so I don't think I can do it myself.
Considering there will be a lot of tokens (neta, ergopad, etc) to be traded on the chain, it will be great if we can see the tokens' distribution on chain (something like cardanoscan or etherscan).

Hello. We are owners of a mini ethereum mining farm. We are interested in mining ergo, but we want to create our own pool to do so. Please, Can you provide us with information regarding my own pool. How  the ergo blockchain will give jobs to my pool? Do i need to install ergo node on my server? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

how do you reply to these messages. if reply does it bridge my reply from here to discord?


[02/03/2022 7:17 PM] glasgowm#9381
Check out the mining guide on ergonaut.space. I think unless you have a couple GHs you're best mining to a solo pool? 

Given you the mining role. See others in #deleted-channel


[02/03/2022 7:17 PM] glasgowm#9381
@erdoge1 not sure what you mean


[02/03/2022 7:20 PM] Andre05#9319
We have 6.7 ghs of ethereum. This is why i want to make my own pool because i believe i have enough computational power to mine for myself in my own pool. Am i correct?


[02/03/2022 7:21 PM] glasgowm#9381
Not sure what the latest is but that may be enough to make it worthwhile. Erg hash is about double I think too.

That's something you'll find in those chats. I would guess yes that it would be worthwhile but not a miner.

You can restore the same seedphrase of yoroi on Nautilus.

how that can worked


[02/04/2022 3:08 AM] erdoge1#0000
the 12 words seedphrase you created when you make a ergo wallet in Yoroi. it work with other ergo wallet too.


[02/04/2022 3:08 AM] erdoge1#0000
just dont give your seedphrase to scammers who private message you.


[02/04/2022 3:08 AM] Arth#0000
the seed phrase wallet is link to the blockchain ?


[02/04/2022 3:09 AM] erdoge1#0000
yes


[02/04/2022 3:09 AM] erdoge1#0000
You can send your ERG to anywhere you want using Nautilus, it doesn't have sync issues like Yoroi.


[02/04/2022 3:10 AM] Arth#0000
if i do that my adresse to received is a new adresse but link to the same wallet in the blockchain ?


[02/04/2022 3:10 AM] Arth#0000

[02/04/2022 3:11 AM] erdoge1#0000
it's crypto wallet 101. just google how bitcoin seedphrase work. ergo work similarly.


[02/04/2022 3:12 AM] Arth#0000
thx for the information i go to read some article about that


[02/04/2022 3:13 AM] erdoge1#0000
anyone who have your seedphrase can steal your entire wallet, so never give out your seed phrase

Like vultures, they hang around our groups, waiting in silence for a question, or a request for advice, and pop they send you a DM:
Hello, how are you
We apologize for the inconvenience caused on your account
And if you are a newbie, and impressed by the fact that someone responded to you so quickly, or by the name or the correspondent (which many times identifies as one of the group Admins), you respond and the vulture/scammer starts weaving his scam lines around you. 
Guys and gals, never answer anyone who DMs you, offering help, 99 out of 100 cases it will be a scammer; keep safe, wait for someone to answer you here, or write in another group, which may be more appropriate for your problem.
And as for the scammer - open his message and hit Block.
And for you scammers, if you have read this far - do yourself a favor, read something about ERGO, it is a beautiful project, and no matter who you are or what you know - you can be part of it, as an investor, a miner, a developer or as a contributor of ideas. And may the Force be with you!

Nice that he has anon_br as an info.
Anyway. The error message is thrown by Android itself. The way I understand it it would say that authentication is turned off, and when that is done it won't work any more for apps. Usually it will also need to restore the wallet when you turn it on again. You don't need to delete the wallet from the app, just restore it and save to overwrite it will repair (re @LuckyRainmaker: Nope.)

Anyway. The error message is thrown by Android itself. The way I understand it it would say that authentication is turned off, and when that is done it won't work any more for apps. Usually it will also need to restore the wallet when you turn it on again. You don't need to delete the wallet from the app, just restore it and save to overwrite it will repair)


[02/05/2022 9:38 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
No, that doesn't affect anything encryption related. (re @LuckyRainmaker: Ok. I'll restore the wallet. This is after I tried ergopay, btw. Do you think it got something to do with this?)

[02/05/2022 1:06 PM] danny#0000
I still couldn't see my ergo balance in yoroi chorme. Either it crashes or circle loading forever.. any help from admin? It happened for more than 5 days


[02/05/2022 1:17 PM] apexpool#3878
there is a much better alternative for android, the Ergo wallet.


[02/05/2022 1:49 PM] danny#0000

Try this. Uninstall Yoroi Nightly, wipe cookies, cache, etc, close browser. Install fresh version of Yoroi Stable. Restore only one Ergo seedphrase, don't restore Cardano wallet. Let wallet fully synced. Now try connecting to ErgoDex.

Also you might want to collect dust and send all assets to one of your wallet address.

I'm using Brave btw.

the hard drive I had my full-node on had to be reformatted. Its currently syncing now but I don't see my balance when i restore my wallet on yoroi or the ergo app wallet. I can see the address where my ERGO is in my yoroi Receive Address Book but the balance is not showing up. Do i have to wait until i get a full sync to get access to my ERGO? Or is something else going on?


[02/06/2022 8:14 PM] glasgowm#9381
You need to derive the next addresses in swagger and yeh won't see your erg until they're synced


[02/06/2022 8:15 PM] nox071218#1778
so i swagger i use wallet/derivenextkey?


[02/06/2022 8:15 PM] nox071218#1778

Dropping the amount being transferred by one token did allow the transaction to complete. Odd this has just recently come up as the app always auto negotiated the charge with out me needing to do anything.


[02/09/2022 10:29 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
It's an edge case that we still need to tackle. It is happening when for sending the stuff a box is selected that contains exactly the needed erg amount, but more tokens than needed so they need to be sent back to your address. To do this, an erg amount is needed but not available. That's why changing the amount helps: it will make either another box get selected or room for the change. (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <rniedosmialek> Dropping the amount being transferred by one token did allow the transaction to complete. Odd this has just recently come up as the app always auto negotiated the charge with out me needing to do anything.)

I‚Äôll throw my question out here in case anyone can answer: How do I find my wallet address or staking key?  I tried using one of my user generated receive addresses and that didn‚Äôt work.  This is what I am trying to do: ‚Äú1. Please enter a Cardano wallet address or staking key which belongs to the same Cardano wallet you intend on making payment from.‚Äù

Cool!  I was told to: 1. Please enter a Cardano wallet address or staking key which belongs to the same Cardano wallet you intend on making payment from. But when i generated a receive address from my wallet and put that in the field I was given an error message.  Can I find this info elsewhere on my Yoroi app?

I can‚Äôt seem to find out my staking key in the Dashboard, transaction,send, receive or delegate tab, nor in the settings‚Ä¶so I have no idea where else to look to get this info


[02/10/2022 9:04 PM] glasgowm#0000
That isn‚Äôt about ergo - please go to the cardano group that was prompted. This is only listed on Yoroi website for support as Ergo is on yoroi.

A yoroi wallet and a Nautilus wallet are the same, if you take your mnemonic (15 word recovery seed phrase) for the wallet in Yoroi, go into Nautilus and add a new wallet->recover, use that mnemonic and you can then use Nautilus for that same wallet.

The wallets not in the wallet app, it's on the Blockchain, the apps both just access it

There's http://localhost:9053/swagger#/wallet/checkSeed or you can make a new wallet and just send the funds over instead.

[02/16/2022 1:46 PM] Luivatra#9076
if you have it restored in another wallet try to send all assets to the wallets address. This creates an internal transaction that "cleans" up your wallets structure.

Too many boxes. Restore your seed in the mobile wallet or nautilus.


[02/18/2022 7:26 AM] root7Z#8699
Nautilus, Mobile Wallets, Yoroi, answered in general


[02/18/2022 2:35 PM] macste#0000
Are the number of wallets at the on chain metrics of ergo watch unique wallets (xPubs) or are these just wallet addresses where one wallet can have multiple addresses?


[02/18/2022 2:39 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Must be the latter, because xpubs aren't known


[02/18/2022 3:06 PM] macste#0000
In my point of view this is misleading. Cant we show unique wallets?


[02/18/2022 3:08 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
How would that be any better? Unique wallets can belong to the same person as well


[02/18/2022 3:09 PM] macste#0000
I aggree but this number looks like we grew 100.000 unique wallets while we just have 10k for example because everyone created multiple addresses


[02/18/2022 3:10 PM] macste#0000
I dont like the term wallet address


[02/18/2022 3:10 PM] glasgowm#0000
There is no ‚Äònumber of wallets‚Äô on ergo.watch, only number of addresses


[02/18/2022 3:10 PM] macste#0000
We know what wallet address means (re @glasgowm: There is no ‚Äònumber of wallets‚Äô on ergo.watch, only number of addresses)


[02/18/2022 3:10 PM] glasgowm#0000
who‚Äôs we


[02/18/2022 3:10 PM] macste#0000
But people who doesnt have that much knowledge will understand it wrong


[02/18/2022 3:11 PM] glasgowm#0000
idk what you mean it doesnt say wallet address either. Says addresses then ‚Äònumber of unique P2PK addresses'


[02/18/2022 3:12 PM] macste#0000
What does unique p2pk adress mean?


[02/18/2022 3:13 PM] glasgowm#0000
unique public address

[02/18/2022 3:14 PM] macste#0000
In my point of view there should be a metric for unique wallets in addition to p2pk


[02/18/2022 3:15 PM] macste#0000
This would reflect the adoption of ergo more likely than just adresses which can be created very easily in one wallet


[02/18/2022 3:15 PM] glasgowm#0000
I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre aware of the metric, probably just harder to track


[02/18/2022 3:16 PM] macste#0000
Is there a unique identifier for wallets? Maybe they can track the number of this unique identifiers


[02/18/2022 3:17 PM] macste#0000
I think that the number of unique wallets is a good metric to set goals for the future

I just restored my yoroi ergo wallet today and it keeps loading?? Been 3 hours. Will not show my funds


[02/24/2022 8:22 PM] Speedehh#0000
Need help


[02/24/2022 8:30 PM] glasgowm#0000
Use nautilus instead. Available in the extension store.


[02/24/2022 8:34 PM] Speedehh#0000
Huh?? What is that


[02/24/2022 8:34 PM] Speedehh#0000
I already have a yoroi wallet


[02/24/2022 8:35 PM] Speedehh#0000
This is support for yoroi, yes?


[02/24/2022 8:35 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
It supports yoroi but yoroi can have connection issues for some users like you described above


[02/24/2022 8:35 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
Here's a guide to setup Nautilus if you want to.

[02/24/2022 8:37 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
If you restore your wallet in nautilus with seed, it will be the exact same balance


[02/24/2022 8:37 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
Funds are tied to address not wallet maker

There's never funds in a wallet, all funds are on the blockchain. Wallets just let you use your seed phrase to create a key and access them

it's happens on every 2-3 transactions, that i have sent 1 assets but my transaction shows that i have sent 2-4 assets, is this yoroi glitch or this means  something different ?

This is just how UTXO works, when sending a transaction, you spend all funds in the BOX, if that contains tokens or change, that will then be sent back to you.

Hello guys! In my country mining has a very bad light because of its energy consumption. But that is actually not a problem, because one can use renewable energy which has 0 emission. Moreover mining can generate income as means to accelerate investments in renewables.

Since then I am thinking of a community initiative for creating streams of income and proving my point. So I decided to initially start with a traditional LLC and later, when it is sufficiently decentralized, convert it into a DAO. But I am not sure how to legally bind company shares to a token on the ERGO blockchain. 

Here is the GitHub repo to my initiative. https://github.com/gnuion/dedao

(re @ErgoBridgeBot: <gnuion> Hello guys! In my country mining has a very bad light because of its energy consumption. But that is actually not a problem, because one can use renewable energy which has 0 emission. Moreover mining can generate income as means to accelerate investments in renewables.
Since then I am thinking of a community initiative for creating streams of income and proving my point. So I decided to initially start with a traditional LLC and later, when it is sufficiently decentralized, convert it into a DAO. But I am not sure how to legally bind company shares to a token on the ERGO blockchain. 
Here is the GitHub repo to my initiative. https://github.com/gnuion/dedao)

Yes from sigmausd, i not sure if it was my fault, i had a different wallet configured to receive the funds, so not the same that had the Sigusd tokens. I'll try the refund thanks


[03/16/2022 6:41 PM] glasgowm#9381
You can follow the tx on explorer - will either be in the receiving wallet or a proxy contract

yes you need a little extra for the proxy contract - think yoroi just sends higher by default

I've just sent the suggested conversion fee but it still failed. To I need to send the suggested fee + something extra?

[03/17/2022 12:42 PM] abashai#9101
Nothing to be concerned about? I've heard of scam tokens on ETH that can potentially give an attacker access to your wallet. While that seems possible, I'm not sure how factual it is. Is it possible to approve incoming transactions in the future?


[03/17/2022 12:44 PM] glasgowm#9381
Just a meme token someone airdropped. Can't give anyone access to your account - not possible to approve transactions afaik

Losing or forgetting seed phrase is very bad. If device you have wallet on gets damaged, stolen, or lost & you don't have your seed phrase then you no longer own your coins. (re @honglieua22: but I forgot my seed)


[03/19/2022 5:36 PM] TypoDaPsycho#0000
So once you get access to your funds, you need to send entire balance to a new wallet (you'll be given new seed phrase, write it down immediately and keep it safe in a couple different locations

I can't read any of the console output to see why because it's constantly spammed with seemingly useless and random information. I can't make any sense of the information either.

Hello admin


[03/20/2022 10:39 AM] max#0000
We don't support Cardano here.
I think you need to include atleast 0.001 ADA along with the token you are trying to send in order to continue.

Hi ergonauts, would be nice on ergo wallet app to have the total amount of erg (of each address) displayed somewhere. Btw if you need some help for UI/ux improvement I can provide some help and create mockups, prototypes on figma & protopie


[03/21/2022 11:55 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
What do you mean with total amount of erg of each address? Asking because that's the biggest number shown so I guess I misunderstand your request üòâ (re @Alex: Hi ergonauts, would be nice on ergo wallet app...)

My ergo node won't sync correctly with the network. I get no report from /peers/syncInfo other than `[]` and when I look at the logs I'm not able to connect to any peers. I have only started encountering these issues after the node software crashed once.

[03/21/2022 1:04 PM] Alex#0000
I mean that within my ergo wallet there are different addresses registered with different amounts of tokens, with the nautilus wallet I can view the sum of all my tokens as well as the division of tokens per each address while on the wallet app I can only see them divided per addresses. (re @MrStahlfelge: What do you mean with total amount of erg of e...)


[03/21/2022 1:05 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Are you talking of derived addresses or completely different wallets?


[03/21/2022 1:07 PM] Alex#0000
Derived addresses


[03/21/2022 1:07 PM] Alex#0000
Registered in the same unique wallet


[03/21/2022 1:14 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
The balance you see is the sum of all tokens on all derived addresses you derived. Maybe not all addresses derived?


[03/21/2022 1:16 PM] Alex#0000
Mhm, maybe I should explain how I set it up. I set up the wallet with read only mode and scanned each qrcode of each address having a certain amount of tokens


[03/21/2022 1:17 PM] Alex#0000
As there was not a qrcode that had the sum of all addresses


[03/21/2022 1:18 PM] Alex#0000
So i see the amount of tokens for each address


[03/21/2022 1:18 PM] Alex#0000
But not the sum of it


[03/21/2022 1:19 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Ah I see. So you set up the wallet as different for the app and have no merged view.
Best is to add the addresses with the extended public key. Delete them all and then add again as read-only, but instead of using a single address use the xpubkey from nautilus


[03/21/2022 1:20 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Then you can derive the addresses and have the view like you want it


[03/21/2022 1:22 PM] Alex#0000
I did it that way as with the single address it did not work. Ill try again later today

[03/22/2022 3:19 PM] yvsingh55#0000
Please help


[03/22/2022 3:23 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
is this on your new device and you've set up authentication with biometrics on your old device?


[03/22/2022 3:28 PM] yvsingh55#0000
This is on my old device only


[03/22/2022 3:28 PM] yvsingh55#0000
I was looking to transfer the wallet from old to new


[03/22/2022 3:28 PM] yvsingh55#0000
But don't find option


[03/22/2022 3:29 PM] yvsingh55#0000
So I thought to empty this to the exchange when I am sending it is giving this error


[03/22/2022 3:29 PM] yvsingh55#0000
I use same pattern lock fingerprint


[03/22/2022 3:35 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
the stored secrets stored with your fingerprint were deleted, this happens when you change the authentication in device settings. you need to restore from your mnemonic, which is the way to add the wallet to your new device as well


[03/22/2022 3:39 PM] yvsingh55#0000
Oh no if mnemonic is misplaced


[03/22/2022 3:39 PM] yvsingh55#0000
Then


[03/22/2022 3:55 PM] yvsingh55#0000
?


[03/22/2022 3:55 PM] yvsingh55#0000
Any other option please


[03/22/2022 3:55 PM] yvsingh55#0000
Can I restore my device


[03/22/2022 3:56 PM] yvsingh55#0000
What is it security of device change so wallet security will be interupted?


[03/22/2022 4:19 PM] yvsingh55#0000
Anyone faced the same issue?


[03/22/2022 4:20 PM] glasgowm#0000
not sure if there‚Äôs a workaround to deleting your stored secrets.

Hello


[03/22/2022 4:42 PM] yvsingh55#0000
I got the keys now can you tell me the steps


[03/22/2022 4:42 PM] yvsingh55#0000
To transfer wallet and balance from one device to other


[03/22/2022 4:42 PM] abashai#9101
I performed a withdraw from KuCoin this morning but never received the funds. The transactions says it completed. When I view the the tx hash, it says "Transaction ID was not found"


[03/22/2022 5:05 PM] abashai#9101
I have the same issue


[03/22/2022 5:05 PM] abashai#9101

use Nautilus Wallet or SafeW


[03/22/2022 11:31 PM] max#0000
I'm guessing https://ergoutils.org is not working anymore?


[03/22/2022 11:42 PM] pskorey#0000
> *(re @erdoge1)*: use Nautilus Wallet or SafeW 
so does nautilus work with the ErgoDEX as well, I have a yoroi nightly wallet with some swaps


[03/22/2022 11:42 PM] max#0000
nautilus is the recommend wallet by ergodex team


[03/22/2022 11:42 PM] max#0000
i recommend SafeW


[03/22/2022 11:43 PM] max#0000
you will want to make sure you fully disconnect the old wallet and clear browser cache, then disable yoroi, before you connect the new wallet


[03/22/2022 11:44 PM] pskorey#0000
oops, i definitely didn't do that, yoroi still has my info, and i restored to nautilus, it sees my balance


[03/22/2022 11:45 PM] pskorey#0000
delete the wallet in yoroi and clear cache, any reason i can't do that now, delete the extension as well?


[03/22/2022 11:46 PM] max#0000
you could if you want, there was a previous bug where ergodex still think i was connected to an address i already disconnected which is why i recommend the above

Not sent enough for the fee


[03/24/2022 8:37 AM] alin#1301
Well when you redeem sigRSV you have to send the exact amount of sigRSV to the address indicated. And the transaction went through. But nothing came back


[03/24/2022 8:40 AM] alin#1301
The issue is with the refund button - minimal ERG value not met. Can a dev take a look at this?


[03/24/2022 8:43 AM] glasgowm#9381
Issue with not sending enough for the fee. Send 0.01 erg and refund.

Hi guys, a Chinese user failed to restore his Yoroi Wallet only using his wallet's mnemonic words. Whenever he restored his wallet using his mnemonic words, the wallet is empty. How can he get back his tokens in his wallet.

He can view his tokens in his wallet on explorer using his wallet address but cannot get access to his wallet.

Hi! Can someone explain to me how to import an Ergo Wallet in Eternl? How are the networks compatible?


[03/29/2022 3:19 AM] cardelayno#0000
It's not. Ergo blockchain is separate from Cardano blockchain, so you can not import Ergo wallet into Eternl which support Cardano only.


[03/29/2022 3:20 AM] cardelayno#0000
For Ergo, you can use Nautilus Wallet on desktop, or "Ergo Wallet" for mobile phone.

thanks for your answer! Being that way, how do I move my cNeta from Ergo Wallet to a wallet that supports Minswap?


[03/29/2022 3:25 AM] cardelayno#0000
cNeta is a Cardano token, it can only exist in Cardano wallets.


[03/29/2022 3:25 AM] cardelayno#0000
If you have Neta in your Ergo wallet, it is Neta, which is an Ergo token.


[03/29/2022 3:25 AM] cardelayno#0000
There is no bridge to swap between Neta and cNeta yet.

@Gazza_SP ‚Ä¶Need some help!  My Yoroi crashed and when I went to recover my wallet I realized I was missing the last 3 words of my 15 word mnemonic.  I have a programmer working on the problem and he is asking me two things I don‚Äôt know.  1) The easiest possible way to put in a 15 word mnemonic and get quick feedback on whether its correct or not. 2) An algorithm for generating (or verifying) the fifteenth word based on the previous fourteen, since it is a check sum.  Do you know the answer to either of those or have any other ideas of how I could recover my wallet?  My understanding is because it is three and not four or more there is a slight possibility it can be done.  I am üôèüèº.  Thanks.

[03/31/2022 8:10 AM] Gazza_SP#5835
I don't have an answer to either of these, my advice is to use the mnenomic dictionary, there's a list of possible words there that can narrow down your bruteforcing options
https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-wallet/blob/master/src/main/resources/wordlist/english.txt

After that, nautilus wallet will allow you to paste in a complete seed phrase into the wallet instead of typing each one so you might be able to use that to check quicker. I have no idea about your second point though, someone else in here might be able to help more. Good luck though I hope you get into it!

There's a docker with a sync'd node if you're still struggling. But please open a git issue with the following details (or paste them and I will)

- Node version
- Java command used
- RAM/CPU
- OS
- JVM version
- Storage location (Cloud, SSD, etc)
- output of ERROR/WARN

Hi! Can someone help please?
I'm trying to redeem SigRSV. I have sent the SigRSV tokens to the correct address, but I'm not receiving the ERGs.. üò¨
Everything from Ergo Wallet (Android)


[04/03/2022 7:39 AM] octopus_shepherd#0000
Can't get it to work with Nautilus either..


[04/03/2022 7:41 AM] octopus_shepherd#0000
Every time y try to redeem nothing happens. No error, just the ERGs doesn't transfer to my wallet. I have to do a refund from sigmausd.io site. Thankfully the refund works and I don't lose my SigRSV..

What do you mean? On same GPU not really. In same Rig on different cards. Yes. In T-Rex bitcointalk dualmining on Erg + x is denied due to new DAG (?) on ERG every new block.

Disable Yoroi (disable NOT delete) and download a better wallet to restore your funds on.

Nautilus for web browser and both mobile wallets are great ime but there's many good options in that link.

@glasgowm anyone else able to help with stuck mixer tx, anon2020s hasn't been back on afaik, last thing he said was the half box needs to become a full box before it will withdraw, my mix has been stuck for a over a week now


[04/05/2022 9:22 AM] glasgowm#9381
what are you trying to mix? erg or a native asset? what ring?


[04/05/2022 9:22 AM] arkadias#4896
erg


[04/05/2022 9:22 AM] arkadias#4896
went through 3 rounds and never progressed so i withdrew it and it never happened either


[04/05/2022 9:22 AM] arkadias#4896
log says  Sufficient confirmations (8225) but its still a half box


[04/05/2022 9:23 AM] glasgowm#9381
what ring?


[04/05/2022 9:23 AM] arkadias#4896
what do you mean which ring sorry?


[04/05/2022 9:23 AM] glasgowm#9381
what size ring did you use, 1erg, 10, 100, etc


[04/05/2022 9:24 AM] arkadias#4896
250 erg


[04/05/2022 9:24 AM] arkadias#4896
otherwise i would write it off


[04/05/2022 9:25 AM] glasgowm#9381
sent some erg into mine @ 250 ring so there should be something to mix with now at least


[04/05/2022 9:26 AM] arkadias#4896
appreciate it but one of the other mods at ergodex had mixers go through after mine, i also did others after this one


[04/05/2022 9:26 AM] arkadias#4896
they all finished and this one is doing nothing


[04/05/2022 9:27 AM] glasgowm#9381
hmm not sure then - are you sure the total isn't correct in your wallet? sometimes they can hang in the UI even if they've been successful


[04/05/2022 9:27 AM] arkadias#4896
yeah no erg in the withdraw address set from mixer


[04/05/2022 9:29 AM] arkadias#4896
idk what to do last thing anon2020s said was that it needs to go through one more mix to finish and it could happen at any time but to message him if it didn't within a couple of days, that was almost a week ago


[04/05/2022 10:44 AM] glasgowm#9381
prob just need to wait for him to be about then

[04/05/2022 11:52 PM] cardelayno#0000
how many possible words are used in seedphrase, 2048 for bip39 standard. so unless you know what the 15th word is, you will have to guess 2048 times to recover your wallet.

[04/08/2022 11:07 PM] Terremot#4855
If you know your seed phrase, just open a nautilus wallet and import the seed phrase


[04/08/2022 11:07 PM] Radioactive#7078
the 15 word seed phrase will work there??


[04/08/2022 11:07 PM] Radioactive#7078
my wallet is really old


[04/08/2022 11:07 PM] Terremot#4855
It will work with any wallet that supports ergo


[04/08/2022 11:08 PM] Terremot#4855
you can even create your own node and node wallet


[04/08/2022 11:08 PM] Terremot#4855
the wallet is effectively only a UI for the information stored behind the seed phrase

Question for you..

Is anyone familiar with an Ergo address that starts with "AXC"? 

I know it's a random question so let me explain.. I'm going through all my transactions (gotta love taxes), and I see a trasaction of a substatial amount of ERG leaving my wallet to an address that starts with AXC. I can't for the life of me track this down. I thought maybe it was the SigmaBank but I did not recieve the SigRSV and the protocol says no funds to refund. 

Every address I have across many wallets, starts with "9".  So I'm hoping someone might now if there's a contract/protocol that starts with "AXC"


[04/10/2022 11:58 PM] BridgeBot#9505

@glasgowm  are there pages where it tells about why scala is chosen, or if blocktime is gonna be reduced and stuff like these?


[04/11/2022 10:09 AM] glasgowm#9381
blocktime won't be reduced, it's a parameter set in stone - can be made less noticeable to the end-user with sub-block confirmations. 

Scala is highly scalable, useful for building fault-tolerant, highly concurrent systems


[04/11/2022 10:09 AM] kii#8888
oooh sub block that's cool. Is there somewhere to read about this?

[04/11/2022 10:10 AM] kii#8888
I really enjoy scala too. Someone was asking, why scala, you should answer. And honestly I dont know the answer lol. 

Why Scala over Haskell btw


[04/11/2022 10:14 AM] glasgowm#9381
Haskell does some things better and is purer, but scala is more practical for use (and established for building highly scalable systems). I remember in my Haskell course we started a few of the lessons with (`now, you'd never actually use Haskell for this`) üòÖ


[04/11/2022 10:14 AM] glasgowm#9381
Scala 3 is also more Haskell-like


[04/11/2022 10:18 AM] kii#8888
i love that comment. hahah


[04/11/2022 10:18 AM] kii#8888
I came from a Java background, so learning scala was pretty much just plug and play. I loved it.


[04/11/2022 10:18 AM] kii#8888
You do engineering too?


[04/11/2022 10:26 AM] glasgowm#9381
took CS at Glasgow, the home of Haskell - so would be rude not to take it)


[04/11/2022 10:27 AM] kii#8888
did you move out of glasgow, and thats why you're in scala now? haha

With Scala, you can use old, proven and at the same time maintained frameworks made in Java, like bouncycastle


[04/11/2022 10:50 AM] kushti#0000
Not many cryptographic frameworks with those properties at all, and there were no any option for Haskell when development was started, dunno about now

[04/11/2022 12:24 PM] stef132#2698
it seems that the wallet is not synchronised with the blockchain


[04/11/2022 12:29 PM] glasgowm#9381
Please use one of the other wallets (Nautilus/Mobile are most popular)

The Yoroi app in chrome does not open and remains blank.
Is there a problem?


[04/11/2022 8:48 PM] liquid_phase#4605
```This is a huge issue right now for everyone using Yoroi, which i assume are lots of Erg's early adopters as Yoroi was one of the only options at first.We need to let everyone who uses Yoroi know the following:‚Ä¢ YOUR ERG IS SAFE‚Ä¢ YOROI IS JUST AN INTERFACE TO TALK TO YOUR COINS‚Ä¢ YOROI IS BROKEN FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST YOU‚Ä¢ YOU CAN RESTORE YOUR ERG WALLET TO ANOTHER WALLET APP USING THE SAME SEED PHRASE YOROI GAVE YOU‚Ä¢ IF YOU DO NOT HAVE YOUR SEED PHRASE, YOU EITHER NEED TO WAIT FOR YOROI TO FIX THEIR ISSUE OR FIND A WAY TO EXPORT SEED PHRASE FROM YOROI (NOT SURE IF POSSIBLE)```

hi guys, don‚Äôt know if you remember but i was the guy that had only 14 frases for the recovery.. i was trying with all the frases aviable and it seems that i had it


[04/12/2022 2:09 AM] j_2518#0000
but when i enter they were no ADA on it.. and i had some in some pool


[04/12/2022 2:09 AM] j_2518#0000
is it posible that i enter to another wallet?


[04/12/2022 2:09 AM] j_2518#0000
or that is blocked or something?


[04/12/2022 2:09 AM] cardelayno#0000
this is an ergo support group. ergo is completely different blockchain from cardano.


[04/12/2022 2:09 AM] cardelayno#0000
you want to try your phrase on a cardano wallet


[04/12/2022 2:10 AM] j_2518#0000
oh


[04/12/2022 2:10 AM] j_2518#0000
i tried on cardano wallet, yoroi


[04/12/2022 2:10 AM] cardelayno#0000
yoroi works pretty poorly, i try a different wallet like eternl


[04/12/2022 2:10 AM] cardelayno#0000
or nami


[04/12/2022 2:15 AM] liquid_phase#4605
In regards to the node wallet issue i was having and am still having:

I discovered that using swagger i can export a '32byte hash' of a seed. Is this seed it generates A) tied to my mnemonic and/or B) convertable to human readable mnemonic?


[04/12/2022 2:21 AM] j_2518#0000
is it possible that i entered another wallet?


[04/12/2022 2:22 AM] liquid_phase#4605
why do you ask


[04/12/2022 2:23 AM] j_2518#0000
becouse i have no assets on my wallet


[04/12/2022 2:23 AM] j_2518#0000
when i restored it


[04/12/2022 2:23 AM] j_2518#0000
with the 15 words


[04/12/2022 2:25 AM] cardelayno#0000
you can restore it on any wallet you want. like i said try nami or eternl


[04/12/2022 2:26 AM] j_2518#0000
okay max, thanks!


[04/12/2022 2:26 AM] j_2518#0000

[04/12/2022 7:55 AM] stef132#2698
@Oberluss#0000  i have the same problem and when i reinstalled it with my recovery phrase the balance is equal to zero where as my address blockchain is not equal to zero@


[04/12/2022 7:56 AM] stef132#2698
@cardelayno#0000 with the same recovery phrase???


[04/12/2022 12:26 PM] glasgowm#0000
you need to derive additional addresses

Yoroi wallet


[04/13/2022 11:22 AM] cardelayno#0000
that's a Cardano token, you need ADA to pay for transactions on Cardano.


we do not support Cardano here

there's just no longer a need for that once we have bridges and usdt tokened on ergochain. make them come to us.

While i appreciate this optimism, lowering the barriers of entry to the ecosystem is in our best interests, even if that means other types of dex's and cex's pairings

it is only installable as a testflight beta, becase in order to have the official one on the app store apple requires a verified bank account.

The iOS app is complete and very usable - just needs to be installed via testflight

ergo wallet mobile have a cold storage feature, basically you  restore the seed phrase on an offline phone not connected to the internet and keep it locked at home, and use that phone to sign transaction for a read only wallet which you restore in your regular phone.

Trying to perform a transaction in auction house. It has taken the ergo for my wallet, given it 8 confirmations,  but it hasn‚Äôt registered it on my auction house platform. It has since taken another bid, but not refunded my bid. Anyone able to offer direction?


[04/17/2022 5:27 PM] GhostCBuster#2855
i'm not sure but sounds like it's tied up in the auction smart contract - possibly until the auction ends and if you didn't win then it refunds? 

I have no idea, i just started using the auctionhouse


[04/18/2022 7:31 AM] wackamg#0683
What do i need to do when i get this error?

Hi guys, I know Ben Schultz made ergo wallet for android and could be used as a hardware wallet and an old android device (not too old)


[04/19/2022 12:11 PM] OlNick#0000
Is there any way to get this to work with ergoDEX


[04/19/2022 12:11 PM] OlNick#0000
of is it best as just a vault


[04/19/2022 12:28 PM] glasgowm#0000
I believe you can pair it with SAFEW and sign from SAFEW via the dApp connector - from the cold wallet. But not used it myself so we need a tutorial)


[04/19/2022 12:29 PM] OlNick#0000
havent used safeW either , I'll look into it though, if it can work I'll be off to buy a new android phone to use it with


[04/19/2022 12:30 PM] OlNick#0000
I know there is a great page for a bunch of links to ergo stuff, like wallets and projects, but I lost my link to it, dunno where I'm thinking do you?

 I used it and it works great. There are caveats though, as it does not relay through a server but generates the transaction on client it works only for transactions with not much Inputs/outputs, otherwise data is too much for the qr code


[04/19/2022 1:01 PM] OlNick#0000
theres a way to reduce the inputs/ouputs by sending everything back to the same wallet isnt there?


[04/19/2022 1:03 PM] OlNick#0000
I just added my main wallet to be read only so I can keep watch on it on my phone and its missing about 2/3 of the erg there should be , this is however aneta wallet

 You‚Äôll need to derive additional addresses - can do it from within the mobile wallet

 Yes, sending all assets will put everything into one utxo/address


[04/19/2022 1:13 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000

 Wallet config -> Addresses -> derive more


[04/19/2022 1:17 PM] OlNick#0000
Yes I think thats what I will have to do, pretty regularly too as I mine into that address


[04/19/2022 1:17 PM] OlNick#0000
Maybe I'll send syuff to a new wallet and just mine in the old one


[04/19/2022 1:18 PM] OlNick#0000

 @MrStahlfelge can tell you - not sure it‚Äôs documented (maybe on the play store)

It's written on the GitHub page :-)

[04/20/2022 4:41 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
Hello, Having a bit of an issue restoring a full node wallet 4.0.23. I tried to restore my mnemonic in a node that was having some issue and I keep getting a message saying "cannot restore wallet during pruning" (tried in main wallet initialization section in the node and then through swagger) so I figured i try restoring in other devices as a test until I figured this out. I also tried as a test to restore the mnemonic in yorio and the android app and when I do I get a completely different main address, tried to derive addresses and after 80 the main node wallet address still hasn't been found. Any ideas?


[04/20/2022 4:44 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
On a side note, I had a previous android wallet that was setup in the android app that I tried to restore and when I entered the mnemonic for that one again in the same android app It also showed a different main address and the original address could not be found when trying to derive new addresses. Any help or explanation as to why this would happen would be appreciated. Thanks.

[04/20/2022 6:38 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
Hi, thanks for the reply, I discarded that android wallet, I had setup a few and this was the only one that had an issue with not restoring correctly (i usually restore after setup to confirm it valid) so I wasn't sure if it was an issue or I possibly didn't confirm something so no worries there.


[04/20/2022 6:39 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
Was still wondering about the "cannot restore wallet during pruning" issue in the full node ( light node version 4.0.23) when trying to restore a wallet. If anyone has a solution for this would appreciate it, thank you again.

Hey, thanks for getting back to me I appreciate it. that's cool I'll setup the light node with a fresh wallet and when I have some time I can restore the other one on a full node. Thanks again for the help.

You need to restore the wallet with your mnemonic, the biometric keys were invalidated

 When you created the wallet you confirmed to have it written and stored at a safe place. Use that notice to restore


[04/23/2022 3:36 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
When using biometrics and someone removes or changes the device authentication settings the saved secrets are deleted.

What should we do about wall tokens in the yoroi wallet?


[04/24/2022 1:09 AM] liquid_phase#4605
Restore using another wallet like Nautilus using your seed phrase/mnemonic.

Yoroi doesn't hold the tokens, it just accesses them - they are safe on the blockchain and you can use another wallet to access them as long as you have that seed phrase/mnemonic

Hi everyone I am new here as well as new to fiddling with nodes and all that. I wanted for fun to install a node off the raspberry Pi(lol). So I got the node setup. The first thing I saw when running was. It couldn‚Äôt  get factory not sure if that‚Äôs a problem. Then it started applying best headers/ modifiers. I let it run for a couple of hours and eventually got some folders. Though I also noticed my peers  misbehaving and getting penalized plus the whole send message and processing 399 non-Tx env. As well as the occasional not allows to have duplicate modifiers.   Is this normal behaviour when syncing? Cause it‚Äôs been a couple hours now and no completed sync.


[04/26/2022 9:14 PM] glasgowm#9381
There's a dedicated Pi server in #üëâ„Äòstart„Éªhere„Äô - requires a bit of tinkering but even best case scenario it'd take a day+ to sync.

 Once yoroi is fixed, can I use ergo wallet (or) nautilus (or) yoroi's ergo wallet simultaneously. Whether all balance & transfer logic work on all together without any problem.

[04/27/2022 6:44 PM] Naveen54321#0000

 What do you mean by "derive some new addresses in-app"


[04/27/2022 6:44 PM] glasgowm#0000
wallets have many addresses, if you perform transactions and generate a bunch of addresses you might need to generate new ones in app.


[04/27/2022 6:47 PM] Naveen54321#0000
So for example, I have only one address registerd on yoroi's extension having 100 Ergo's. So are you saying the same will remain the same when I restore wallet on ergo (or) nautilus (or) it will change


[04/27/2022 6:48 PM] glasgowm#0000
remain the same


[04/27/2022 6:48 PM] glasgowm#0000
but if you send 5 transactions and end up with 60 erg in 6 addresses you might need to generate 5 new addresses next time youre in yoroi to see it


[04/27/2022 6:52 PM] Naveen54321#0000
> Naveen54321 re @glasgowm: but if you send 5 transactions and end up with... 
 
 Okay, so let me ask with an example, I have 100 Ergo's & have only 1 wallet address. In my case, since I have only 1 address with 100 Ergo's in it, i hope the above condition (or) restrictions does not apply to me even in case I have 50 transactions, since all were carried from single address.

Is there a way to recover a seed phrase with one missing word?


[05/02/2022 7:03 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
The list of words is public and linked in the wallet app. You can try every word.


[05/02/2022 8:16 AM] Shankar Vembu Aky#0000
I already did. The thing is i got my complete seed phrase but when im typing it to the wallet to recover one word is not showing in the "public words".


[05/02/2022 8:17 AM] Shankar Vembu Aky#0000
I know i got a correct set of seed phrase because I literally write it in paper and copy pasted it. That's why im confused on why it is not working.

Hello,  Looking for help.  My Disk where I was running my Local ERGO Node became corrupt and of course its Mirrored pair the same.  I get errors when trying to sync.  I do have a backup of the wallet directory and it was uncorrupted.  I recreated my node but kept the wrong 15 word key to restore the wallet (From a test node)  Is there anyway to reintegrate my wallet into my new node ?  I can see all my coins in the ios app but its a read only wallet

Hello! I have a few problems with Yoroi+Ledger.
There is a "Error received from server while getting account state." while Im trying to sync with blockchain.

Hello, I was setting up a fresh node and it looks like the instructions are a bit different now https://docs.ergoplatform.com/node/install/ so  I just had a quick question. When I issue the command to run the node for the first time (windows) I was getting an error with "-Dlogback.stdout.level=WARN -Dlogback.file.level=ERR" those flags, also the ergo.jar isn't specified as a specific version which in previous versions the version needed to be specified i.e "ergo-4.0.27.jar". So I am wondering if I got an error with those flags because I specified a version of the jar? and I should run the command without specifying the version instead or do you need to specify the version?


[05/05/2022 6:56 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
I wound up running: java -jar -Xmx4G ergo-4.0.27.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf


[05/05/2022 6:57 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
and it worked but running java -jar -Xmx4G -Dlogback.stdout.level=WARN -Dlogback.file.level=ERR ergo-4.0.27.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf


[05/05/2022 6:57 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
did not work


[05/05/2022 6:58 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
Anyway it's working but I wasn't sure if this was an issue and the website needed to be updated because people could find it confusing or just me not doing things the way I should. Thanks


[05/05/2022 7:01 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
On a side note, I had asked previously about restoring a light node wallet, and I restored it to this node and got the correct address so that seems to be working good also so that problem I had is now fixed too. Nice job on the new website BTW whoever designed that did a good job.

log level settings have been moved to the config file in the latest version that can be removed now. ergo.jar is just a placeholder for the actual `.jar` in the folder. I've swapped it for `ergo-*.jar` but not sure if wildcards work on win

Hi Ergo Support/Developers, ETH will soon be completely PoS in a couple of days & everyone will start migrating to different coins. I really hope Ergo has the capacity to handle this without any profit reduction. I hopefully prey that Ergo price goes up & up as much as possible.

Hello. Not sure if this is the right place to be asking or not. However, I have an ERGO wallet that had 2 gnomekins in it. I hadn't checked it for a long time and recently was trying out the Sky Harbor website, and noticed that one of them will not load. I tried on the Ergonfts org site and it is the same. There is a broken image and it either times out or just doesn't load. The metadata is in there though. In the past, it used to be OK, as I have viewed it there before. Any ideas what has happened and how I can fix it? Thank you.

Thank you for the explanation. I will try again tomorrow and see if it is any better. I wouldn't have thought the gnomekin NFT image files would be that big as a lot of them are visible. Thanks for the reply. Will check it out. üòç üôè


[05/08/2022 6:52 PM] liquid_phase#4605
not sure if its just IPFS having issues, but fwiw i havent been able to see my NFTs for a couple days now. they're in the wallet, but the actual image link is broken. They probably still havent implemented any form of compression or caching, as that would add resource congestion to their already limited network...

Disable Yoroi but DO NOT delete until you have restored funds on new wallet.

Ah right. Yeh docs are still a bit messy. Not sure if there's a tutorial specific for webapps but those two are good for the communication bit. Will have a look.

Ergo does not have the script reference input thingy yet, no? Meaning I need to have the full script in R1 each time? Are there any limits to that, and are they practically relevant?

 I don't mind telegram over discord or vice versa, I just have a lot of partically dumb questions and don't want to clog up the wrong channels...
I know about data inputs but I mean script inputs, hence me referring to R1


[05/13/2022 8:41 AM] glasgowm#0000
ah right, not sure then - not got that far myself.
Discord is better then, #dev-support, #development, #ergoscript-support, etc. enable the channels with the reaction roles

(re @performance_review : *I just see that there have been more replies by Mr Stahlfelge, looking through them now. But "there is no onchain code" gives me the expectation that this is not what I need either*) 
 
 onchain code is ergoscript where you already found information for. so, it is what you need but not everything if you want to design your own smart contracts. and it is not exlusive as the offchain code can be done in a programming language of your choice


[05/13/2022 8:47 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
but as glasgow pointed out, you are better asking on discord #dev-support

Hi, Is there any problem with sigUsd? I have sent 50 sigusd to the generated address, but received nothing. The refund is not working as well.
I got this error when using refund menu: "requirement failed: Minimal ERG"
What should i do now?
@anon_real


[05/14/2022 7:52 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Usually it helps to sent some small amount of erg to the address


[05/14/2022 7:54 PM] glasgowm#9381
how did you send ? Use the dApp connector/ergo-pay. You need to send enough erg for the tx fee so it can refund


[05/14/2022 7:56 PM] fateme.r#4033
Used proxy address.
Is there a problem with proxy?


[05/14/2022 7:56 PM] glasgowm#9381
no but you need to send extra erg to cover the tx fee


[05/14/2022 7:57 PM] fateme.r#4033
What's the problem of sigusd? Will it work next time? Or does it have a problem now?


[05/14/2022 7:59 PM] glasgowm#9381
It will work next time if you send extra erg with it.


[05/14/2022 8:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
send 0.01 erg with the tokens when redeeming


[05/14/2022 8:01 PM] fateme.r#4033

please discuss with them so we can take ergo in yoroi wallet


[05/15/2022 9:09 AM] glasgowm#0000
Please try the steps described at the end of 2) here. Resyncing wallet, disable and reenable plugin. Yoroi works it's just very slow. 
Failing that is there anything else that could be done @anon_br ?

Hello, I need some help. I have some ergopad tokens in my Nautilus wallet. I am trying to stake it but the ErgoPad keeps telling me to ‚Äúeliminate form errors‚Äù. What am I doing wrong? I created the Nautilus wallet by inputting the seed phrase from Yoroi which now has been quite dysfunctional. Could this be the problem? How to stake my ergopad tokens? Thank you!

Hello admins, I have swapped some ERG tokens for ergopad ones. I can see both in my Nautilus wallet but when I connect my walet and go to the Dashboard of the app the ergopad ones are missing in the balance. Hence I cannot stake them. What should I do to be able to see and stake them? Thank you!

Download latest version of node, then delete /history, /peers, /wallet/registry and /state.
Then start up your node and let it resync, should work after that


[05/20/2022 5:08 PM] Alexg#3768
nope , it doesn't ... I started syncing from scratch yesterday , "appVersion": "4.0.29",  (I guess latest)

If not, then download 4.0.25 version tagged with RC1 I believe. Then follow these instructions:

Anyone else having big issues with Yoroi Wallet? I have like 50 failed transactions and a bunch of missing transactions.


[05/21/2022 5:52 AM] tflynn#6411
generaly advice would be to not use yoroi. just import into a wallet that actually works


[05/21/2022 5:55 AM] New England Crypto#5506
Good to know.. Yoroi had been working find for months... crazy. It was what was suggested back when I 1st started mining it


[05/21/2022 6:14 AM] tflynn#6411
its especially sucks if you have many eutxos in the wallet... say from mining rewards. if you make a tx to send all your ergo to yourself it will speed up yoroi. but my advice is still to just use a different wallet

Hi there !  I have a problem with Yoroi for Ergo , i know it is no longer supported  it but i wos unaware of this  and the firefox extension still works , so i generated a new adress and transfered not a small amount of ergo to my wallet . After a few days i checked and nothing . The transaction went thru and can be seen on the blockchain but nothing in my wallet. I tried to restore my wallet on the ERGO mobile app  using the seed phrase but the last transaction did not show.  Is there anything i can do to restore my funds or they are lost forever ?

I don't know what is happening but someone had access to my wallet and stole all the ada i have 
No one has access to my computer
No one has access to my password/phrases
No one has access to my phone 
I didn't click on any shady link 
And it was transferred to another type of wallet,  it is a Byron Daedalus-style address. They start with DdzF.

That‚Äôs normally what it says when you ctrl+c, anything before that? And it‚Äôs now doing this straight away from a fresh sync?

(re @glasgowm : *That‚Äôs normally what it says when you ctrl+c, anything before that? And it‚Äôs now doing this straight away from a fresh sync?*) 
 
 That's what it normally says right before it shuts down after time out.
It runs for a few minutes (10 or so) though before shutting down.
Fresh sync takes more time but ends in the same result.
I tried using some executables from swagger UI and it gives me an error

@glasgowm it finally worked. don't know what the problem was because earlier versions all got stuck. 4.0.30 seems to work though


[05/24/2022 10:36 AM] Dario#0000
didn't use -xmx4g so that was not the solution to the problem

I downloaded the Nautilus wallet extension to use it as Testnet on ERGODEX. I noticed that during the installation there is no option to install as TESTNET. After the installation I went to tools to change the network to TESTNET, but there is no such possibility within the Nautilus wallet. How to use Nautilus wallet as TESTNET?

Hi! I have a problem with Yoroi for Ergo in my Chrome extension. I transferred a considerable amount (personally) of Ergo to my new yoroi wallet. The transaction went thru and can be seen on the blockchain but nothing in my wallet. 
The transaction keep refreshing from pending to failed (for > 1 week). I tried resync or restoring my wallet but it does not help. 
Is there anything i can do for this issue?

Try 4.0.25, specifically the rc2 branch

thank you for the tip, i will try it now.


[05/31/2022 7:07 PM] xerofyme#2026
should i delete the .ergo folder and try synching again for it to work tho? D:


[05/31/2022 7:10 PM] glasgowm#9381
well doesn't hurt to try just swapping it out first and seeing if it starts ticking over


[05/31/2022 7:21 PM] xerofyme#2026
i just did the swap and it didn't help. just to be sure that i am using the right version. i downloaded and tested https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/releases/tag/eip27-rc2 and https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/releases/tag/v4.0.26


[05/31/2022 7:22 PM] xerofyme#2026
i hope this is what you meant by rc2 branch :3 i cant find a branch specifically named rc2 in the repo.


[05/31/2022 7:24 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeh looks like it's 4.0.26

[05/31/2022 7:24 PM] glasgowm#9381
And yeh if swap didn't help, delete .ergo and restart (keep the wallet folder inside if you want to restore that)

so my issue got fixed. at first i tried using both eip27-rc2  and v4.0.26 and neither worked. @TimL gave me a good tip and i edited the conf file and added peerDiscovery = false and  checkEIP27 = true which worked in the end. both node and wallet are synced now üôÇ

Yes, replace x with the number you like

As far as I know there is a refund link on sigmausd.io that can be used.
Btw: if you use tokenjay to interact with the AgeUSD bank, funds can't get stuck. Try it next time. :-)

[06/18/2022 9:36 PM] Siegfried#2220
Ok, after I check the explorer I think the minting SigRSV works like: Pay ERG to proxy address -> Another agent mint the token and send the token back or refund if minting failed
However, this time no token was sent back, and there is no refund as well. I cannot generate the transaction to refund as well due to that error. Can anyone help me understand what's happening? I'm trapped.

How frequently are you shutting down? Turning off sleep can help. Even if you use `/shutdown` if the threads haven't had time to shutdown in the bg or they're hanging it can cause a corruption. Are you running with the -Xmx flag?


[06/20/2022 5:04 PM] Strupf#5194
-Xmx8G. Shutting down once a day perhaps.


[06/20/2022 5:07 PM] Strupf#5194
You mean Windows sleep mode or threading sleep on Java?


[06/20/2022 5:09 PM] Strupf#5194
A bit sad because I thought I could support the network easily by keeping it running when I'm on PC. If I can't sort it out I'll just leave it as is and wait for new versions of the client

[06/23/2022 2:40 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Which wallet app are you using? Some of them do not support looking at the seed again past the first time - but the Ergo Mobile wallet app for android and iOS does allow you to view the mnemonic in the wallet settings


[06/23/2022 2:41 PM] Chadwicksracing#6027
I have the Ergo Node wallet


[06/23/2022 2:42 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i do not believe the node allows you to view the mnemonic again after the initial time.

since you have access, you will likely be best off transferring all assets to a new wallet where you firmly copy and keep safe the mnemonic


[06/23/2022 2:43 PM] Chadwicksracing#6027
shoot, I Have dex assets on this wallet

[06/23/2022 2:54 PM] liquid_phase#4605
you won't be able to send anything until it syncs. once it syncs it will show the correct balances of erg and neta and anyhing ergo native. it might not properly display the token name as Neta, might be some string of characters

Hi guys, I created a new Nautilus wallet the other day and wanted to access it on another computer. I input my seed phrase but I'm not seeing the same address and I have no funds. Is there a way to view the seed phrase on the original machine to make sure I copied it down correctly? Or is there another reason this might happen? Pretty sure I wrote it down correctly but obviously can't verify 100%.


[06/28/2022 3:12 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
I dont believe Nautilus shows you the seed phrase. So I would assume you wrote it down wrong. In that case I would recommend sending your ERG from your old wallet to a new one (where you correctly write the seed down)

I'm still trying to run a node, but when it syncs to 90% it starts shutting down. It is normal that it uses all the resources available? I'm running it on a VM on a server with multiple processors, RAM, etc. The most resources I assign to the VM the more it uses.

Hi!  I am using the ergo mobile wallet on my phone.   When I send ergo to an exchange with it, what network does it use?


[06/28/2022 10:23 PM] BuckSkin#6730
I sent some ergo to Coinex, and it arrived there.  However it is frozen until a certain number of block confirmations occur.  What block chain did the ergo use to get to Coinex?

 Ergo uses its own blockchain

I usually use 3g but you can use 4 or whatever you want


[06/28/2022 11:53 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
Also, sometime the wallet can slow things down, if you already initialized the wallet, shut down the node.. what I did was can change the name of the keystore folder to something like 'xkeystore'  then restart the node and let it sync without the wallet.. then shut down the node again, change the folder back to keystore and let the wallet sync after the node has fully synced


[06/28/2022 11:59 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
you might get an error for the keystore folder but you can just ignore it, it should still sync the node without it

I can reach my node with 127.0.0.1:9053. but I can't reach from another device on the network


[06/29/2022 10:59 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
127.0.0.1 is a pseudo IP for referencing the machine itself.. you have to check out what the IP of your machine is in your network

Hey there

Hi, hope someone can help. My first time sending ERGO from kucoin to ErgoWallet on iphone. Kucoin shows that withdraw status completed. I got a TxHash but when I click on it, it says 'Transaction with this ID was not found, or it has not entered Mempool yet'
Does it take long for this? It's been 30 minutes

 30m not that unusual if busy

If what is busy? Kucoin or ergo network? Ergo network doesn't seem to be that busy

Kucoin


[07/03/2022 4:48 AM] Sam46#2169
Seems like a KuCoin issues even though it says it was completed. Didn‚Äôt receive anything. Send one directly from mining to the same wallet and got it in minutes.


[07/03/2022 5:00 AM] SBR#0001
I'm having the same issue on KC. I submitted a ticket. Says 'completed' but the TXID doesn't exist

Open issues with kucoin


[07/03/2022 4:58 PM] SBR#0001
So I just got my ERG withdrawal from Kucoin. Just wanted to note that the transaction hash is different from the one they posted the other day. So I'm not sure what's going on there. I might have to change exchanges because it seems shady. Does anyone have a recommendation for a better more reliable exchange for ERG?

No rewards/incentives for running a node, you can avoid the pool fees by mining to your own node though.

looks like your conf file is in a different location, it should be in the same directory as the jar file so in your case it would be in c:\ergo


[07/06/2022 5:25 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
and then you run the jar from c:\ergo as well

EIP-27 Mainnet Activation Voting and Final Details
EIP-27 got successfully activated @ block # 777,217 . Now the biggest question for pools and miners is how to handle rewards and payments.  In the first place, note that emission in Ergo is done via a contract (releasing ERGs each block according to a schedule set in the contract). After EIP-27 soft-fork,  re-emission tokens are attached to mini...

 You should generate the addresses while syncing, you can also rescan after sync.

[07/07/2022 7:22 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
The node wallet will automatically do this when you spend your reward, nothing for you to do specifically

When I go to transfer the reward, I get an error.

Well thats okay, the reward doesnt auto transfer to your wallet, your wallet just spends from that address in addition to your normal one

"Otherwise, burn re-emission tokens when you have them in (mining rewards) inputs, and send the same number of nanoERGs to pay-to-reemission contract (it P2S address is 6KxusedL87PBibr1t1f4ggzAyTAmWEPqSpqXbkdoybNwHVw5Nb7cUESBmQw5XK8TyvbQiueyqkR9XMNaUgpWx3jT54p for the mainnet)."


[07/07/2022 7:47 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Nah, that won't work and will likely cause problems. There's a specific set of instructions you have to follow and I'm not sure the normal node wallet lets you do it manually

maybe there is some delay after the node starts?

I think, the wallet shows 48erg now

Yeah thats the correct amount

instead of 60

It has been a real struggle


[07/07/2022 7:55 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Well if you've figured it out, I'm sure many other solo miners would appreciate a guide if you could make one.

@AllCloudy | GetBlok.ioI hear you are a miningcore god, I'm looking for suggestions for my config.json file. I have an ERGO node setup and just want to mine to my node. I just want the rewards to go to the node wallet. What should I put in the config.json file for that?... Also if I am mining to my own node, should I use varidiff? Or should I just set a static difficulty? Would it be more likely to hit a block with a low static diff like 1.0 if I'm not worrying about network congestion?

Any help would be appreciated üôÇ


[07/08/2022 12:25 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Well I wouldn‚Äôt say a MC god lol just have lots of bruises üòÜ.  Let me get a sample, simple, ergo conf that people can use.  we set our vardiff in a way that‚Äôs pretty much static.


[07/08/2022 12:28 AM] Babelfish24#2887
Cool I just don't know if I set the payments to false, will it just keep the rewards in the node wallet? And as far as the difficulty goes I have 15 gh across 12 machines and don't know if there is a point of raising the difficulty "to limit network congestion"


[07/08/2022 3:50 AM] Babelfish24#2887
Have you had a chance to create a sample config.json?


[07/08/2022 3:50 AM] Babelfish24#2887

Can someone help me, i've send ERGO to buy an NFT to the ERGO Auction House but my funds are gone but I didn't win the bid and there it hasn't come back to my wallet. Any idea how this can be resolved or who to contact. It was to but an Neta Angel - sort of new to this.


[07/17/2022 11:36 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Try using the refund tab. If you are new though make sure to check the mint address on auction house. There are many fake nfts at the moment there


[07/17/2022 11:44 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
As a new user, I would recommend you join the artists discord or check their website to find out their real mint address and make sure any NFT you buy has this mint address.
Otherwise, if you haven't heard of <https://www.skyharbor.io> feel free to check it out, they have verified collections which do this check for you to make sure any NFT from the collection is authentic.

[07/18/2022 3:55 AM] liquid_phase#4605
seems like a derived address issue perhaps.

In nautilus, maybe click the new address button a few times

The addresses are derived from a root, and that root address is associated to a seed phrase


[07/18/2022 3:56 AM] liquid_phase#4605
if you restored your yoroi wallet in nautilus, then did a few transfers, nautilus makes automatically new derived addresses for privacy purposes


[07/18/2022 3:56 AM] liquid_phase#4605
so it would still have the yoroi address there, as its not a 'yoroi' address but an ergo address accesible from any ergo wallet


[07/18/2022 3:57 AM] liquid_phase#4605
so if you restored your wallet from yoroi into nautilus using a seed phrase provided by yoroi wallet, then nautilus control that address now. sometimes because of UTXO, funds get sent back and forth between your different boxes/addresses.

make sure you are using the latest version. Also, I have seen nodes not accepting api_key during syncing (usually if some aspect of syncing is going wrong) but they resolve once synced usually

I've been testing out token maximum amounts, and when I mint `Long.MaxValue` amount of tokens or around that much (9,223,372,036,854,775,807) the Ergo Explorer and Ergo Node Interface displays a number which is higher and rounded up. (9,223,372,036,854,776,000)

Here's an example transaction: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/eead913e7fc4b6cfdf5a1bd9bbcda0738280332194b2ec3a0a3583aeb4b28205

I'm not sure if the Node Interface/Explorer is bugged or if I'm minting more tokens than I desired

 This is only J's bug which comes from number format of JavaScript.
It's only display wrong amount.

[08/06/2022 1:39 PM] CorvaMox#2528
I started mining in pool to make up for lost time


[08/06/2022 1:40 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
If you switch from solo to standard mining I believe you lose your effort on that pool.


[08/06/2022 1:41 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
There is usually a time window if you aren‚Äôt mining it will reset your effort or luck


[08/06/2022 1:41 PM] CorvaMox#2528
change after waiting 8 hours the block after the luck is reset


[08/06/2022 1:42 PM] CorvaMox#2528
Ok no problem. Ty for you time


[08/06/2022 1:43 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
I believe hero shows a list of blocks found at the bottom of their page.  If there is no block listed there for you then something else probably happened.   If not, They have a channel in Telegram you can try for more support.


[08/06/2022 1:44 PM] CorvaMox#2528

Correct. Happens a lot.  Could be due to latency to the pool or just unfortunate luck.

they have minimum amount to payouts

check out on their UI how much it is and how much you are owed by them

[08/08/2022 7:44 PM] pa6uk#7509
Hey! I have a strange situation. In May 2022 I installed Ergo Mobile, created a new wallet and received 251 ERGO to 4 different addresses from Ergo Mixer. 
Now I restored a wallet with the seed phrase, but it shows only 2 addresses with funds. The other 2 are gone. I manually added additional addresses (like 20 of them), but all of them are empty.
Did anybody encounter the same mistake? What shall I do?

p.s. If the seed was wrong - all addresses would be empty. But the fact that 2 out of 4 can be seen and the other 2 are gone is confusing.
p.p.s. I have checked addresses derived from m/44'/429'/0'/0/2 and m/44'/429'/0'/0/3 (derived address 2 and 3, which are empty), and they have no transactions according to explorer, so I did not forget that I moved funds somewhere or they were stolen (also stolen from 2 out of 4 is strange).


[08/08/2022 7:58 PM] wombo22#5461
just to confirm the two missing addresses, they also had ergs in them and so now you are missing funds? would that be correct


[08/08/2022 7:59 PM] pa6uk#7509
Yep, that is correct


[08/08/2022 8:04 PM] wombo22#5461
that is indeed quite strange


[08/08/2022 8:04 PM] wombo22#5461
where did you restore the wallet


[08/08/2022 8:05 PM] pa6uk#7509
Ergo Mobile, same wallet I did it in the first place


[08/08/2022 8:07 PM] pa6uk#7509
Installed older version which seems to be active at that time, but it did not help. Though it is also strange - app said "Found 4 used addresses". But only 2 of them with funds again. So it is strange that it see 4


[08/08/2022 8:07 PM] wombo22#5461
hi @MrStahlfelge sorry not sure if this is related to the mobile wallet but has anyone ever brought up this issue before and would you be able to help


[08/08/2022 8:13 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
(re  : *<pa6uk> Installed older version which seems to be active at that time, but it did not help. Though it is also strange - app said "Found 4 used addresses". But only 2 of them with funds again. So it is strange that it see 4*) 
 
 It says 4 addresses because 4 have transactions. When they have 0 balance it means balance has been moved


[08/08/2022 8:16 PM] pa6uk#7509
Explorer does not confirm this version. Same for 2 addresses.

[08/08/2022 8:18 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
This is an address that was automatically created on restore?


[08/08/2022 8:19 PM] pa6uk#7509
Yes


[08/08/2022 8:21 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Okay, I can just say how the wallet works. It restores address 0, and then it cycles up beginning with 1 as long as the found address contains a transaction history. If an address has no past transactions, the loop is done.
So in theory if it restores 4 addresses these all should have past transactions.


[08/08/2022 8:24 PM] pa6uk#7509
So either the explorer is somehow wrong when displaying this info (but wallet can see those txs), or there is some mistake somewhere. How can I check it? I can share all the necessary details if it will help.


[08/08/2022 8:31 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
The wallet requests information from explorer, so this is especially weird.
If you want I can check tomorrow the derivations when you send me your extended public key. But I can do nothing else than what you did. Sometimes the results are different though. üòâ


[08/08/2022 8:41 PM] pa6uk#7509
Yep, sure, that would be great. Can you DM me please?


[08/09/2022 3:33 PM] Awdi4Life#9782
Hello, I am not sure if this is the best place to ask but I would like to setup a full node for ergo to support the network. And I am not really sure what would be the best low cost hardware to use? I was thinking maybe a rasberry pi 4  but that's like about 250$ for a starter kit.  I was unsure if there was maybe a better  lower cost option? Any suggestions?


[08/09/2022 3:43 PM] wombo22#5461
rasberry pi's seem like affordable options but which rasberry pi in particular that would be a lower cost is the go to to ask I feel.


[08/09/2022 3:45 PM] wombo22#5461
i would have just forwarded you the ergo pi discord channel but not sure I can


[08/09/2022 3:45 PM] wombo22#5461
let me try actually


[08/09/2022 4:02 PM] Awdi4Life#9782
Well if I bought one I figure why buy older model and then maybe need to update it later and waste more money which is why I suggested the 4 specifically the 8gb but I dunno 250$ seems like a lot to spend on a node that has no rewards as much as I want to support the eco system I don't really have 250 to spare and rather buy more erg lol


[08/09/2022 4:03 PM] wombo22#5461
that makes sense


[08/09/2022 4:03 PM] wombo22#5461
then ya pretty sure a rasberry pi would be the lowest cost option from what I know of but I could be wrong


[08/09/2022 4:05 PM] wombo22#5461
try in the #node channel to see if anyone from there might know of any cheaper options


[08/09/2022 4:06 PM] Awdi4Life#9782
I didn't see a node channel maybe I wasn't paying attention... damn ADHD

You need to enable them in the top channel in each category (best solution until Discord lets you subscribe to channels natively). Enable it in #deleted-channel


[08/09/2022 6:14 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
i believe the rpi foundation is designing a 5 but with the global chip shortage we probably won't see it for awhile. with that said i have one too many 4's but the 4gb is a good sweet spot in terms of versatility, horsepower, and cost

[08/13/2022 9:22 PM] mhs_sam#1471
sorry I was away.
Lemme know your setup. You're using a stratum server with what? Are you using open source miner? or closed one? By 13 miners you mean 13 GPU connected to one mining software or 13 separate rigs?


[08/13/2022 9:47 PM] blindrun#0649
13 separate rigs


[08/13/2022 9:48 PM] blindrun#0649
about 130 gpus


[08/13/2022 9:48 PM] blindrun#0649
I have the node running and the stratum


[08/13/2022 9:48 PM] blindrun#0649
the rigs are running a mix of lolminer and trm


[08/13/2022 9:52 PM] blindrun#0649

Please send me the stratum and miner log, here or DM


[08/14/2022 12:00 AM] dmorrison91#2829
I have tried, but the balance always comes up zero. I screwed something up in a node update and the blockchain wont sync, I think, and the erg balance isn't increasing to what it should be. I can see the wallet and the correct erg amount is there, but I don't have a way of adding a transaction i don't think to move it out of this node into another wallet if the blockchain/node isn't syncing and updating. I've tried the mnemonic on other wallet's but the balance is always zero...? I don't know what to do next.


[08/14/2022 6:32 AM] blackinsecure#3693
add more addresses using one of the wallets


[08/14/2022 6:32 AM] blackinsecure#3693
not necessarily your erg is in the main address of your wallet


[08/14/2022 6:32 AM] blackinsecure#3693
maybe @MrStahlfelge could help with that


[08/14/2022 8:17 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
If the address is really old, it might be a pre EIP 3 address. Then it can only be restored with the node and a special setting in the config iirc


[08/14/2022 8:36 AM] blackinsecure#3693

Wallet config -> addresses -> derive more

Hey, can someone explain to me what is the connection between Ergo and the Eth merge?


[08/17/2022 4:38 PM] glasgowm#9381
Ergo is mineable.


[08/17/2022 4:40 PM] WiZ_D#9063
Yes and?


[08/17/2022 4:41 PM] WiZ_D#9063
What is the difference after the merge if it's already mineable now?


[08/17/2022 4:41 PM] glasgowm#9381
The eth merge means ETH will no longer be mineable.


[08/17/2022 4:41 PM] glasgowm#9381
so gpus will look for new homes


[08/17/2022 4:42 PM] WiZ_D#9063
And why would they look for ergo?


[08/17/2022 4:51 PM] Meatball#9519
The overall connection is once ETH is no longer GPU mineable people are going to be looking at _any_ coins that they can still mine and might be profitable.  Some will come to ERG based on the fact they like the project, but there's also a large amount of people that will go to whatever coin is the most profitable.


[08/17/2022 4:51 PM] Meatball#9519
If you look at WhattoMine, at least today, coins like Flux, Neoxa, Ergo are up there in terms of profits and not much below ETH.


[08/17/2022 4:52 PM] Meatball#9519
So, there's not really a direct connection per se other than you'll have a lot of hash power looking to go somewhere, and surely some of it will come to Ergo.


[08/17/2022 5:09 PM] wombo22#5461
What‚Äôs your understanding of the eth merge so far, probably best to say that to help others tailor their response to you (if more detail is required)


[08/17/2022 6:05 PM] WiZ_D#9063
Oh ok I understand thank you appreciate it


[08/17/2022 8:47 PM] VillageBC#0000
I'm just experimenting with running a Ergo node off a RPi 4. If I'm not using it for storing Ergo is their any reason to initialize the wallet?

If you don‚Äôt want to use that wallet then probably not

Hi, checking my old transactions and wallet totals, I noticed a weird thing. Wonder if anyone has a theory/insights on what happened. It happened in May 4th, I had a transaction there that seems to have made some tokens I had disappear. They also don't exist anymore in my wallet totals. Not huge amounts, not a huge loss, but just something I'd like to understand, if there's something I should do about it to avoid in the future.

There was a transaction with 16 outputs going in, but only 14 appearing on right side. One thing I noticed, the tokens that disappeared were listed twice on the left side (outputs), in this case it was 2x2000 NETA, and 2x2000 Mi Goreng. On the right side, they are listed just once, and thus from both of these, 1x2000 tokens just disappeared. 

I heard about some issues with too many tokens in same wallet, so was wondering, is there an issue I should be aware of. This time it was tiny loss, but could have been worse, and I'd like to understand what happened. Any theories?

anything in particular you would like to be able to do with your wallet or just in general if there are any better wallets


[08/29/2022 1:43 PM] wombo22#5461
there are probably different features each of the wallets may be able to provide, so it maybe worth to look into each to determine which one you find more useful


[08/29/2022 1:48 PM] wombo22#5461
but if you just want a wallet to store and use, then doesn't matter to much which one you use they all equally good

(re @odiseus_me : *My ergo node (built by the Satergo wallet app) keeps on crashing every 10 minutes or so, and I am getting this error message in the UI:

 In Akka, messages that can't be delivered are routed to a synthetic actor which has the path ‚Äú/deadLetters‚Äù. This is for NON transport lost messages. Akka makes no guarantees for lost messages at the transport layer. Existence of dead letters does not necessarily indicate a problem, but they are logged by default for the sake of caution

So not that helpful of a message, you get it when the node is running fine too. That should just be a WARN, if it's crashing there should be some others and maybe an ERROR

Just getting started in Ergo (coming from cardano)
I'm interested in mining ergo on my laptop and wanted to know if it was worth it 
I have an AMD Ryzen 7 3700U with Radeon Vega Mobile Gfx     2.30 GHz

Also, any recommendations on software?

(re @glasgowm : *So not that helpful of a message, you get it when the node is running fine too. That should just be a WARN, if it's crashing there should be some others and maybe an ERROR*) 
 
 So, as the node keeps on synching it keeps on crashing
anyhow - the first error that i am getting is this:
11:34:09.930 ERROR [ctor.default-dispatcher-4] s.c.n.NetworkController - Declared address validation failed:

Starting yesterday, I was no longer able to send ERG using nautilus.  It would say the transaction was successful, but would never show up on Ergo Explorer ("Transaction with this ID was not found, or it has not entered Mempool yet)".   I thought maybe something was down on nautilus, so I installed the Ergo's official mobile wallet and tried to send my ERG with it instead.  However when I send ERG with the official mobile app I get a long error that includes words such as "Could not send transaction" "Error executing AP request" "Error 400" "Reason: Bad Request" "Detail: Malformed transaction"  "has too high cost".   I even tried to send to a different destination address, but still have the same problems with both wallets.  None of these issues started until yesterday. Any ideas???

At the moment, transactions for depositing and withdrawing Ergo from the platform are limited.

This is true ?¬† When can we expect the work to be completed?

What error? Do funds match the explorer? You may need to derive new addresses


[09/06/2022 10:46 AM] jkpw#1293

[09/06/2022 10:58 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Is the address the same?


[09/06/2022 11:15 AM] jkpw#1293
Yeah but I'm getting a bit confused here. 

I originally had a Yoroi wallet. Yoroi lost support so I moved to Nautilus, I imported my Yoroi seed phrase to Nautilus and since then, I've been buying more Ergo.

I've tried to now restore my Naultilus wallet into the iOS app but it shows I have 0 funds. I've now just tried to restore my Yoroi seed phrase into the iOS app and it shows funds (but only half of what I was expecting, I guess these are the funds that were originally in the Yoroi wallet).

Where's all the rest? 
I don't understand how I have around 400 ERG in my Yoroi wallet when I switched to Naultilus, shouldn't this be now 0 and my Naultilus wallet should be the main wallet now?


[09/06/2022 11:16 AM] jkpw#1293
it could be that I've been generating new addresses when receiving funds in my Naultilus wallet but I thought they would all link to my main xpub address


[09/06/2022 11:16 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Probably funds on more derived addresses. Wallet config -> addresses

(re  : *<McCastigatore> I am so desperate to really hope that they were some kind of support*) 
 
 Sigmausd.io does not tell you that you have to include some ERG for it to work. So usually what people are doing then: send 0.1 more ERG to the address provided and use the refund link to get the Sigrsv back. Then I recommend you to use tokenjay.app for the next try to redeem, compare the user experience of the two dapps and use the one that was better in the future


[09/06/2022 3:20 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000

I submitted a transaction to exchange SigRSV for ERG which was confirmed at 2022-08-12 16:07:52. It&#39;s been over 12 hours and the ERG has not been sent, nor has the original SigRSV been sent...

Any ideas?


[09/07/2022 8:18 AM] McCastigatore#5816
Maybe my problem is correlated with this (I have 710000 RSV stuck on a proxy address, I sent 0.15 Erg and tried the refund process but it didn't work)


[09/07/2022 8:20 AM] ayfant#0000
Maybe proxys are unreachable for some reason


[09/07/2022 8:22 AM] McCastigatore#5816
On reddit a developer told me that the bufferunderflow exception means not enough ERG in the proxy address. I will try sending a bit more ERG and let you know

Can payments go directly to nautilus wallet and not am exchange?


[09/09/2022 12:44 PM] wombo22#5461
yep, you essentially mine to an address


[09/09/2022 12:45 PM] wombo22#5461
nautilus is used to view the address and easily interact with the ecosystem


[09/09/2022 1:36 PM] peachmufffin#8779
I initialized a new wallet on a node.
After mining, there is some amount on it.

I started another node and used the same seed phrase during wallet initialization.
Through this new node, I tried to send a transaction and got an error: There must be at least one input box.
I also noticed that now a different address is used on the new node.

How can I fix this? 
Should I use this method `/wallet/updateChangeAddress` and pass in body the address from the first node?
I tried to do this and I get this error: `"The request content was malformed:\nexpected whitespace or eof got 'address...' (line 1, column 2)"`

so I just restarted with the numonic and made a new node pass

Best just using one of the more popular wallets. Can run a node too if you like, but the node wallet isn't very user-friendly and more for dev use. 

But you don't mine to the node unless you're solo mining

How do we propose to fix this difficulty, its way to long and we are about to see a 2 day cycle of  "Ergo Difficulty way to high" that causes everyone to jump off ( like it currently is we are at 146T/H), then 2 days later because everyone jumped off the Difficulty will become extremly low causing everyone to jump back on causing this massive influx of people again, then we are going to be in this massive cycle?

Difficulty adjust as miners jump off, it‚Äôs a lagging difficulty adjustment. However the only real way to make it profitable is for the value of the coin to go up. With the current macro environment it will be tough in the short term but should be fine over the next few months.

No I am lying... sorry. The thing just solved itself. I made only 1 tx and that has only 90 confirmations now.


[09/18/2022 6:18 PM] TheJetmaster#8904
I assume that means the tx is still in transit? Why is the chain so slow today? Any public reason?


[09/18/2022 6:52 PM] Steel#8070
Blocks are slow today, but funds should show up after only 1 confirmation.


[09/18/2022 6:58 PM] TheJetmaster#8904
Hmmm still not showing in Yoroi. In the explorer though I see the final balance. Weird


[09/18/2022 7:03 PM] Steel#8070
That's good to hear, your funds arrived and you shouldn't worry. I would recommend switching wallets though, Ergo users have been plagued with Yoroi syncing issues. You can restore your seed on any of the other wallets. I'd recommend Nautilus for browser, and Ergo Mobile for Android/ios

Price increasing does nothing to this rediculous lag.... same wave in and out... you're suggesting the low tide will be more profitable as the price will help, but why not even the seas and make the low and high tide in more of equilibrium.


[09/18/2022 9:56 PM] elazor#0115
Only thing I‚Äôm suggesting is lower difficulty makes it easier  to mine blocks, which may mean more profits for a miner. I‚Äôd be happy seeing it like eth, currently I don‚Äôt see that big of an issue with the current set up. 

As I see it people are free to jump in with all their hash and mine unprofitably on any coin at this point. Everything is unprofitable. If ergo ends up being like eth (the most profitable coin) there is no real incentive to jump in and out of it. The only scenario I see where this can pose a problem is if there are 2 profitable coins (including ergo) that are essentially equally profitable. But at this point in time that‚Äôs not the case. Feel free to email the ergo foundation with the concerns or put it on Reddit where it can be discussed more thoroughly.


[09/18/2022 10:08 PM] cannon#3541
Thanks. Closed thinking is why the mining reward was slashed and difficulty was not addressed.
 Everytime mentioned since eip adjustment it has been pooh-pooh, tut-tut let me explain why you're wrong and a greedy noob miner. 
I hope, truly, the chain and project is successful. I've engaged more thoroughly with this than any project.
But, this difficulty blunder is only acceptable because there are 100TH of morons that are buying coin (via mining) at higher price than available on exchange ... around $11/erg is mining investment.

someone else reporting an issue with 2miners in #üó£‚îÇgeneral


[09/19/2022 10:12 AM] Sinauth#0001
There are many issues going on with ERG blockchain right now. Please can someone investigate?


[09/19/2022 10:15 AM] glasgowm#9381
Blocks are a bit slow atm due to difficulty adjustment which means the oracle is slow, but no ongoing issues outwith that afaik; my test payment just confirmed fine. DM me the address you're trying to send from - sure you've not clicked the wrong one?


[09/19/2022 10:17 AM] Sinauth#0001
I've been mining for more than 3 years. I am confident with what I'm doing.

UTXO chains? 'cause it's pretty easy to get mixed up with derived addresses


[09/19/2022 4:34 PM] nessim#0000
Hi Ergo fam.
I was wondering about the difference it exists between ErgoScript & Haskell (Plutus platform).
I know the latter is a functional programming language. I had the opportunity to use Lisp back in the time in college and I wasn't able to appreciate what a functional language can bring, it's now done thanks to Cardano. But what about ErgoScript ? Is it more enjoyable to use it for programmers? 
Please someone enlight me here.
Thanks üôè

Spectrum Labs | Ergo x Cardano Cross-Chain DEX! | episode #20
Today, I sat down with the founders of Spectrum Labs. They are actively developing a cross-chain decentralized exchange for e-UTXO Chains such as Ergo and Cardano in particular. They will also launch other cross-chain compatibilities with Ethereum's blockchain and offer a non-custodial wallet solution with the DEX also built-in.

Yes I was

What is token jay?


[09/19/2022 6:18 PM] wombo22#5461
Mr. S made it, the creator of the ergo mobile wallet, it just an better experience with dealing with the protocol

you can also check out the ergo mobile, it has it built into it

 What an amazing explanation! 
From 10:00 to 20:40
Everything is said and it's very hard to deny the real life experience of the Spectrum team as they are working both in the ergo and Cardano ecosystem.
I'll share the info on twitter as well.
Thanks mate üòä

 How many confirmations? It needs 60, if it‚Äôs above that you should open a ticket with kucoin


[09/20/2022 11:15 AM] Martin#0000

Yes of course, never put your phrase anywhere or give it to anyone (other than restoring from verified downloaded sources)

if you have to ask, it is extremely likely that it is

I did it sadly and there was a failed transaction on my Yoroi wallet when I just logged back in so the Ergo is still there what was


[09/20/2022 1:18 PM] Martin#0000
Now I tried to send it quickly back to my KuCoin account to be safe and the transaction is stuck submitted status


[09/20/2022 1:18 PM] Martin#0000
How long could it take to go through?


[09/20/2022 1:20 PM] glasgowm#0000
restore on nautilus and send, yoroi is useless


[09/20/2022 1:20 PM] blackinsecure#3693
Yoroi is not recommended. Use your seed phrase in a trusted wallet

Yes

But indeed transfer the funds to a new address, because if you put your seed phrase in that scam website then that address is compromised

I tried to transfer it to my KuCoin back where I bought it but it stays on Submitted


[09/20/2022 1:23 PM] glasgowm#0000
Yes sir but if you check explorer I imagine there‚Äôs no funds to send and yoroi is just displaying old data


[09/20/2022 1:24 PM] blackinsecure#3693
recover your wallet on Nautilus and see if the funds are even still there


[09/20/2022 1:24 PM] blackinsecure#3693
Yoroi probably not even syncing the new data


[09/20/2022 1:25 PM] Martin#0000

you can follow transactions easier but first off you would have to figure out who's address it is then the person would have to send you the funds and sign the transaction themselves which they probably wont

[09/20/2022 2:07 PM] Martin#0000
this all happened because of Binance not handling ERG

Sad to hear that buddy. Crypto is still like the wild west. You have to be aware of extremely creative scammer tactics these days. Especially when you are playing with defi you have to question everything. Hell even me haha. People in discord groups, people sending you dms acting like customer support. It‚Äôs still early days. So learn from it and don‚Äôt make the same mistake twice

Ergo uses Scala which is quite different syntax from Javascript though the logic of programming is the same in all languages

Here is the Ergo DeCo layman course getting you started in ErgoScript (where smart contract scripts are written)

So would jumping straight into scala be hard or is there a more beginner Friendly language I should I learn first


[09/26/2022 1:38 AM] Purple Octopus#4028
idk maybe watch some of the DeCo videos to get a more general overview of developing smart contracts on Ergo ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[09/26/2022 1:41 AM] Purple Octopus#4028
ErgoScript is supposed to pretty simplified for development but like anything else, it will take time to learn especially if you're new to coding.

Python is much easier to learn for most new coders and getting a handle on programming logic but you'll learn much more faster if you are motivated to build some kind of project.

Is it possible to ask my node what the current network difficulty is?


[09/26/2022 5:20 PM] essaias#5787
yeah, the /info call contains a difficulty item.

my server is not listening on 9053 after I run the "java -jar -Xmx4G ergo-4.0.101.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf" command


[09/29/2022 4:03 AM] XfEnE#5891
what can i check to get the API running on port 9053?


[09/29/2022 5:25 AM] essaias#5787
Is rpc enabled in your ergo.conf? Which port?


[09/29/2022 1:42 PM] XfEnE#5891
not sure I just did a basic conf .. i was going by the https://docs.ergoplatform.com/node/install/#prerequisites how would I enable the rpc?


[09/29/2022 1:44 PM] glasgowm#9381
Is this a remote server? Do you have a webserver setup?

this is just a local machine I have debain running on


[09/29/2022 2:04 PM] glasgowm#9381
Then `9053` should work providing it's running. What does the output of the command say?

I'm trying to run the node as a service on Ubuntu 20.04 based on the FAQ in the docs page but I'm getting the following error:

Java is in the path and the node runs fine if I just run it manually. Any ideas of what' I'm doing wrong?


[10/01/2022 12:09 AM] glasgowm#0000
permissions at a guess? `chmod +x run_node.sh`, or you can see more a error output with `journalctl -x` or `systemctl status node.service`

[10/01/2022 1:17 AM] ElMoren0#7288
Thanks! I should have checked the journalctl. It turned out that even though java was in the path it needed the absolute path. Also, IDK why but sdkman installed java in my user folder and not /usr/bin. I ended up putting the full java path in the run_node.sh and it works.

downloaded the latest one just for this


[10/01/2022 9:39 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
So when it looks stuck, chances are that you have many small boxes and explorer/node you are connecting to respond slowly. The latest version restrict to 100 boxes but it still need some time, but surely not forever.
Do you try to send from a read only wallet or set up with mnemonic?


[10/01/2022 12:09 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Did you succeed now?


[10/01/2022 12:11 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Thought about it some more. Chances are that you really have a lot of boxes on the address and the token is on a box coming at the end. Now the restriction to 100 boxes will not apply, because the boxes arent added because they don't contain the token. It will end up in a long wait time.
Recommend box consolidation, try to send all your coins to yourself and see what the app tells you!

[10/01/2022 4:37 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
ok, I've checked the address. it has more than 1300 unspent boxes, would recommend to keep it at 100 max. So what you should do is really sending to yourself. Use a tx fee of 0.002 as otherwise the tx will most likely not succeed at the moment.
There's nothing that can go wrong with sending to yourself. Do it as long as the wallet states that you have to many boxes to send.


[10/01/2022 4:38 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
what will help a bit is to use a node that has a very low response time for you. check with the wand in the settings

 Large transaction with the lowest fee (0.001). You probably have to wait until after the hardfork.
Miners pick the transactions based on fee per byte (highest to lowest)


[10/02/2022 4:06 PM] bobovich#2179
and when is the end of the hard fork?


[10/02/2022 4:10 PM] bobovich#2179
and if 0 is sent?....as on the Ether...maybe it will be canceled


[10/02/2022 4:11 PM] bobovich#2179

[10/02/2022 4:16 PM] essaias#5787
in approx 16 hours from now. depends on the miners

if more join its going to *happen earlier, if more leave its going to take longer


[10/02/2022 4:18 PM] essaias#5787
your transaction may be executed earlier. depends on mem pool backlog. currently you just can wait

Probably will work if you explicitly select a box that is known to be unspent on the explorer and spend with higher fee. If you are allowing node to do its own selection then it may be selecting invalid input boxes. Otherwise, removing wallet folder will probably also fix

 Do not worry. You should make another wallet (Satergo on PC or Android wallet on the smartphone for example ) and simply send all your funds to new one as far as you still have access to old one. The seed phrase from new wallet should be kept in safe place then.

While Binance is, in fact, the largest exchange in the world, Ergo is only a few years old and step by step has been achieving all its goals, so eventually, sooner or later, they will inevitably list Ergo.

Hello is @MrStahlfelge online? I'm getting a weird error when using Ergo Mobile wallet to exchange for Sigma tokens. I'm using 2.2.2220. 
MrStahlfelge had an old development post about what looks like the same problem back in April
https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/669989266478202917/976475221404024832

@MrStahlfelge So I tried out the box consolidation dApp as well and and when I go back to trying to exchange for Sigma tokens I get the message:

*Message from dApp: Could not prepare your exchange transaction: You don't have XXX tokens on this address, only 0. Please retry (EFHZRL)*


[11/07/2022 6:50 AM] Purple Octopus#4028
However, my amount still pops up on my wallet. Very confused


[11/07/2022 6:53 AM] Purple Octopus#4028
~~The box consolidation transaction was cancelled if that means anything~~

Nevermind it just now popped up as executed and the box consolidation worked


[11/07/2022 6:55 AM] Purple Octopus#4028
And the Sigma token message is going through on the tokenjay dapp

[11/14/2022 12:08 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @AGeO : *It can‚Äôt sync nodes, because can‚Äôt connect ipv4 address*) 
 
 Well, there is no public reachable IPv6 node at the moment. If you can't somehow connect through IPv4, you can't host a node. There needs to be at least 1 node that is open through IPv6 for you to access the network


[11/14/2022 12:12 PM] Satergo#0000
The node didn't even support IPv6 until a few months ago when I submitted a fix, so that might be one reason there is no public IPv6.


[11/14/2022 12:17 PM] K#0000
Ipv6 is future, we need more ipv6 nodes


[11/14/2022 12:18 PM] Satergo#0000
Sure, start one if you can


[11/14/2022 12:19 PM] AGeO#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *The node didn't even support IPv6 until a few months ago when I submitted a fix, so that might be one reason there is no public IPv6.*)

[11/14/2022 4:22 PM] glasgowm#0000
(re @AGeO : *Thanks your answer. Looking forward to more such nodes.*) 
 
 There‚Äôs one displaying on ergonodes as reachable - so should work? I‚Äôve switched mine over to IPv6 too


[11/14/2022 4:29 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @AGeO : *Thanks your answer. Looking forward to more such nodes.*) 
 
 Scotman started an IPv6 node but you will need to add it manually


[11/14/2022 4:30 PM] glasgowm#0000
Shouldn‚Äôt it be able to pick up this one?

[11/14/2022 4:30 PM] Satergo#0000
No


[11/14/2022 4:30 PM] Satergo#0000
The way nodes are discovered is that there's a few hardcoded known peers in the node which are connected to and then you request more node IPs from them


[11/14/2022 4:31 PM] Satergo#0000
All hardcoded known peers are IPv4 so it will not work for him, but he can add scot's node to the list of known peers


[11/14/2022 4:33 PM] Satergo#0000
Add to your conf file at the bottom:

`scorex.network.knownPeers = ["[2601:204:c003:57e3:95b6:6344:5577:3e9c]:9030"]`


[11/14/2022 4:37 PM] Satergo#0000
Also, this doesn't necessarily mean that your node will only be connected to this one. Since your network doesn't support IPv4 you won't be able to connect to others, but if you make your node reachable then other nodes that have networks that support IPv6 connections as well will connect to you. AGeO

(re @mewtoshi : *The way nodes are discovered is that there's a few hardcoded known peers in the node which are connected to and then you request more node IPs from them*) 
 
 I see, thanks for the info. Maybe we need to hardcore some ipv6 ones, is there a reason it can‚Äôt (or doesn‚Äôt) broadcast on both ipv4/6 if avail?

(re @glasgowm : *I see, thanks for the info. Maybe we need to hardcore some ipv6 ones, is there a reason it can‚Äôt (or doesn‚Äôt) broadcast on both ipv4/6 if avail?*)

If you press the magic wand next to the node url field in the Ergo wallet app it will search the fastest node for you. Prefer HTTPS nodes. 

Of course, you can also enter your node there as long as it's public.

Hey! I asked the ADAX exchange Reddit about the possibility of getting Ergo listed on their centralized exchange. It is primarily focused on Cardano, but I thought it would be a good fit for ergo. Their head of business development said it would be able to be done, but that someone from ergo needs to apply. I am reaching out here hoping I can notify the right person to get the ball rolling so we can finally get an exchange that can easily transfer between ergo and Cardano. Is there someone here that can help get this message to the right place

looks like they did also mention that they would list ergo for free but hopefully its not anything fishy behind the scenes


[11/28/2022 10:13 PM] Texonja#3403
Sorry for raising this issue again, but my friend have similar situation as this one. 
He mined ERGO for some time and stored it on iPhone wallet, which is "expired".
He installed new version (just like you did) , but it doesn't restore his original address with coins. Instead, it is some other totally random address with balance 0. Of course I asked him if seed is correct and he confirmed that's only seed he have for ERGO. We even tried to install Android version on my phone and restore wallet using seed and again got address with balance 0... üòî 
Can you please tell me how did you solve this problem? (if you did)
Or someone else can help with this?
Thanks in advance!

 Click into the wallet and generate more derived addresses.


[11/28/2022 10:31 PM] Texonja#3403
Created like 40+ of them, but all are empty.
Should I create more ?

[11/28/2022 10:38 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Derivation is now fixed. If it is an address which has different address fix/non fix there is hint when restoring. So not likely that issus

 Was there a warning when restoring about an invalid mnemonic? Or a button "this is not my address" on Last screen?


[11/28/2022 10:39 PM] Texonja#3403
No, everything was smooth during restoring.


[11/28/2022 10:41 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Then my bet is on that it's not the right mnemonic


[11/28/2022 11:00 PM] Texonja#3403
He is sure that's only mnemonic he ever had and only address he ever had on his phone.


[11/28/2022 11:00 PM] Texonja#3403
I don't know what else to try...


[11/28/2022 11:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
Is it hand written?


[11/28/2022 11:01 PM] Texonja#3403
Nope, screenshot.


[11/28/2022 11:04 PM] glasgowm#9381
Sounds like either a) he's wrong and it's the wrong mnemonic / he made more than one b) it's an old wallet and he made lots of addressees for some reason and his erg will be 100+ derived addresses in


[11/28/2022 11:11 PM] Texonja#3403
I can't say anything 100% since this isn't about me. 
Long story short - he has "expired" wallet on his iOS and 800+ ERG stuck on his address (which he cannot access with this seed he has). Is there some advice what can he do? Or just to forget about those coins?


[11/28/2022 11:17 PM] glasgowm#0000
Well the first thing would be b) generate more addresses. If it doesn't show maybe try another wallet just in case. Failing that try and find the correct mnemonic.


[11/28/2022 11:19 PM] Texonja#3403
Tried iOS wallet, Android and Desktop, with same result.
Tried creating 260 new addresses.... We can try more but...... üòî


[11/28/2022 11:25 PM] wombo22#5461

[11/29/2022 7:20 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Problem won't be as pressing in the future when your payout is bigger now. But you either need to spent the 100 0.1 erg boxes or consolidate them, they are blocking and won't go away

Hi guys.  I need some help calculating Time To Find a block.    For something like bitcoin it's
```
TTF = (Network difficulty  * nonce space [ which is 2^32]) / pool  hashrate
TTF = network difficulty * 0x100000000/ pool hashrate
```

i'm trying to find what the Nonce space is for ergo, and i can't seem to find it in the white papers and my google magic isn't working today.  Does anyone know?

By my rudimentary calculations  it's around 2^20 or 0x100000

Can someone please set me straight?

Ergo Node Wallet Balance Not the Same as Explorer [Support]
Having issues with my node wallet I think. I have a local node and a stratum server. Set up to mine to it. Looks like I hit a block showing a mining reward but my mobile wallet that should be the same address shows 0 and so does explorer. If I try to transfer funds I get the following error. 
[image] 
Not sure whats going on. I tried a wallet rescan. Funds showed up again but still not on anything...


[12/21/2022 10:01 PM] matty_19#4994
Hey thats me lol. If anyone can provide some direction that would be awesome. I had a look at Ergo Doc Solo Mining page and I'm still not sure whats happening. Block reward looks like it's paid to my reward address. Shows up as a balance on my node wallet, but not on Explorer or my mobile app that should be linked. Confirmations on the transaction look like they are at 1160 but still doesn't seem accessible. Maybe i have something configured incorrectly. Scanned unspent boxes and it shows al the confirmations but spending transaction null. Wallet was made in the Ergo Node Interface.


[12/21/2022 10:03 PM] matty_19#4994
Did you end up finding the issue?


[12/21/2022 10:06 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
@matty_19 nope. Still shows a balance but no availability. Shows in unspent boxes and thousands of confirmations


[12/21/2022 10:06 PM] matty_19#4994
im in the same boat


[12/21/2022 10:06 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
Yeah and no help


[12/21/2022 10:07 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
I've pretty much chalked it up to lost. Not sure if I'm going to start my pools back up and support a project that doesn't help the small guys

[12/21/2022 10:11 PM] cafebedouin#9837
@glasgowm, any suggestions for these gents?


[12/21/2022 10:19 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Actually, looking back at the conversation, kushti asked you to confirm: "Where it shows 0.02?" And looking at the image, I have the same question. The only thing the image shows is a wallet balance of 45.033087. Hard to understand what you are talking about.


[12/21/2022 10:20 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Normally, if you have thousands of unspent boxes, it helps to consolidate them.


[12/21/2022 10:20 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
Sorry I didn't see his question. The wallet shows the balance but when you go to available balance it only shows.02


[12/21/2022 10:20 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Because of data limits you can only make transactions of a certain size to consolidate them.


[12/21/2022 10:21 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
Only one unspent box . The block in question has thousands of confirmations


[12/21/2022 10:22 PM] matty_19#4994
I'm in about the same boat. Ergo node interface shows 57, ergo explorer shows 0 on my wallet. Scanning unspent boxes shows over 1100 confirmations


[12/21/2022 10:22 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
@cafebedouin and if you go to the wallet on the explorer it only shows a balance of .02


[12/21/2022 10:24 PM] cafebedouin#9837
So, the issue is there is a discrepancy between your node wallet and explorer, and it's not a problem of confirmations.


[12/21/2022 10:24 PM] matty_19#4994
i also can't transfer to anywhere from the node wallet


[12/21/2022 10:24 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Have you checked another explorer instance?


[12/21/2022 10:25 PM] kushti#0000
(re  : *<matty_19> I'm in about the same boat. Ergo node interface shows 57, ergo explorer shows 0 on my wallet. Scanning unspent boxes shows over 1100 confirmations*) 
 
 Because mining rewards belong to time-and-pubkey lock script, not your "normal" p2pk address. Just send all the funds to yourself in the node wallet, and Explorer will show them after transfer being confirmed on chain


[12/21/2022 10:25 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Well, if you have lots of boxes, you probably need to consolidate them.


[12/21/2022 10:26 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Or, kushti's explanation, which is better.


[12/21/2022 10:27 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Think kushti's answer above also applies in your case.

Which address am i using to do that? I tried the wallet address from the Ergo Node Interface page already? or am I supposed to use a different one?


[12/21/2022 10:31 PM] kushti#0000
Send to this address


[12/21/2022 10:32 PM] kushti#0000
If you want to just confirm your rewards with the Explorer you can also get mining rewards address via swagger api ui


[12/21/2022 10:34 PM] matty_19#4994
Yeah i have the mining rewards address and that shows the balance and transaction on Explorer. When i try to send my ergo from Node Interface it gives me an error so i can't do anything with it currently


[12/21/2022 10:35 PM] matty_19#4994
hmm won't let me paste a pic of the error on here lol

Doesn't seem surprising lol. Not sure what i'm doing half the time but it all connected and ran, and managed to mine a block so i was hopeful.


[12/21/2022 11:14 PM] matty_19#4994
what should it look like to fix it?


[12/21/2022 11:19 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
@kushti#0000 so use the command line for the node wallet and send the funds to another wallet? I tried doing that via the node wallet through the panel but that doesn't work.


[12/21/2022 11:21 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I think you can just send it to the same wallet. It's just a different kind of box, one that doesn't show in explorer I presume.


[12/21/2022 11:25 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
@cafebedouin looks like that worked. I am guessing I will have to wait 720 confirmations?


[12/21/2022 11:26 PM] matty_19#4994
Did you just use the normal wallet address on the Ergo Interface?


[12/21/2022 11:28 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
@matty_19 I used the wallet that was setup with the pool. That is where the balance was and I sent it to that address and it sent

Yeah i still get errors when i try to send it still. Hmm


[12/21/2022 11:34 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
I had to send less than Max. So I lowered it to 45 even though it said I had 45.367


[12/21/2022 11:39 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I'd guess that only applies to the box subject to the time-and-pubkey script. New box shouldn't have that constraint.


[12/21/2022 11:40 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Does max include the mining fee?


[12/21/2022 11:41 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I don't use a node wallet, so just trying to provide general help here.


[12/21/2022 11:43 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Try here and enter in your address manually into the Consolidate boxes option. https://tokenjay.app/app/


[12/21/2022 11:43 PM] cafebedouin#9837
This will tell you how many boxes you have.


[12/21/2022 11:43 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
The Max does include the mining fee I believe. I'm just happy it sent

{Reactions}
üëç 

[12/21/2022 11:44 PM] cafebedouin#9837
If there are many, you might have to get smaller amounts to get the transaction size small enough.


[12/21/2022 11:48 PM] matty_19#4994
Ok I'll try when I get back home.


[12/22/2022 12:35 AM] matty_19#4994
well thats fun neither worked. Same error no matter the amount and tokenjay says no unspent boxes


[12/22/2022 12:38 AM] matty_19#4994
but the reward address shows 2 unspent boxes


[12/22/2022 12:50 AM] cafebedouin#9837
So, reviewing. It looks like you are looking to claim a mining reward box. This is why it doesn't show on tokenjay. For some reason, I thought you were dealing with many boxes. So, first issue is there is a delay before you can claim a mining reward box. If that time gas passed, you can restore your node seed in something like Nautilus, send all assets to your main address, and it should work.


[12/22/2022 12:52 AM] matty_19#4994
Yeah its up to like 1200 confirmations


[12/22/2022 12:56 AM] cafebedouin#9837
So, passed time. Then, it should just be a matter of claiming and sending to your address.


[12/22/2022 12:59 AM] matty_19#4994
so i would recover the same wallet just on nautilus instead?


[12/22/2022 1:02 AM] matty_19#4994
I recovered it on Nautilus and same thing. Shows nothing


[12/22/2022 2:05 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Yeah, now, on assets, scroll to bottom select all assets, and then send to your main address for that wallet.


[12/22/2022 2:05 AM] cafebedouin#9837
I think that's how you claim it, at least what I gather from above.


[12/22/2022 2:48 AM] matty_19#4994
yeah it shows nothing for assets on nautilus as well.


[12/22/2022 3:12 AM] HastyBear#6742

Not sure if that looks better? I'm not super well versedin working with JSON files


[12/22/2022 3:35 AM] matty_19#4994
ooooo that wouldn't let me send the full amount but i lowered it to 40 ergo and it seems to have worked. Just sent it to myself and now the transaction is showing. That must be the correct format i guess.

I hope I'm not jumping the gun but funds seem to be showing up correctly and accessible.


[12/22/2022 5:54 PM] claudiodelf#7503
Gentlemen, some information
What difficulty do I have to put currently in the start.js file on ergo on personal node?
I would like to set a minimum share difficulty of 18/19 GB but I don't remember how to do it.

Thats what mine was set do from default. Miners are targeting port 3032 so should be on variable if im not mistaken. Seems to be working, but i couldn't tell you how well just got it online this week and managed to hit a block though.


[12/22/2022 6:52 PM] claudiodelf#7503
Is this setting good for the current difficulty and shares starting from 19 gb +-?


[12/22/2022 6:53 PM] claudiodelf#7503
the slightest difficulty at 8 does not convince me


[12/22/2022 7:16 PM] matty_19#4994
Couldn't tell you but it worked and i mined a block. As i understand it its variable based on the hash rate so it won't sit that low. Somebody more well versed will have to fill you in further.

I also don't think share difficulties matter all that much if you're solo mining as i understand it. More of a feedback indication unless I'm mistaken.

Not sure if this is the right place to ask but I'm using via wallet app for storage of all my ergo but that wallet is not mentioned as safe wallets for self custody. Can anyone here can say if that wallet is safe or not.. Just curious


[12/27/2022 4:36 PM] glasgowm#9381
It was burning native assets, not sure if that's been fixed but not recommended for that reason.

So if you sent SigUSD to it or any native token - it was burnt.

Hello , just now completed the installation / procedure to make Ergo Node , currently syncing blocks ,  but i have couple of question please : 1- into my hive flightsheet , i should add my <node ip>:9053 , is the port 9053 is the correct one ?  my second question is :  is it possible to use Zelcore wallet address once i do mining instead of swagger UI created wallet address ?  my last question what is the suitable hashrate you think it is worth to do solo mining with Ergo node , example 5 G/hash is good ?

Crypto Mythbusters: Solo Mining Pools Are Useless
When cryptocurrencies came along, everyone mined independently, otherwise known as solo mining. As competition increased, rig owners needed to team up; this is how mining pools emerged. IN THE BEGINNING, THERE WAS SOLO, AND SOLO WAS GOD. Every miner used to have his node. But with the advent of...

but i guess thats the writers opinion


[01/04/2023 10:57 AM] glasgowm#9381
probably slightly higher with a pool since they will have configured everything correctly and may have efficiency improvements.


[01/04/2023 12:24 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
well, if we say so in the pool is better , what is the consideration of  Latency , as in the node the latency almost zero , but in pool latency is higher ! , well , if said also latency is not important , then why there is node developed ?


[01/04/2023 12:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
node is the reference client and how devs (and pools) interact with the chain.


[01/04/2023 7:17 PM] Ergo_Boy#0000
@glasgowm Have a look, maybe found a node client bug. I‚Äôm running 5.0.4, and Aberg and I found this oddity while testing Satergo. I restored a wallet in node and found the balance doesn‚Äôt show. The address is same. And when you click the link to explorer the balance is correct‚Ä¶.here‚Äôs the screenshot.

Try sending to yourself to see if it registers it in the new block. Also an API endpoint in swagger to rescan blocks.

Ok will try


[01/04/2023 8:40 PM] Ergo_Boy#0000

I sent seed to Kushti if he wants to try to reproduce.

Are you on the right block? Match explorer? Sometimes can freeze and display as synced when it isn't

Yup latest block 911195. I‚Äôm leaving the issue alone now. If it‚Äôs a real bug, you guys will determine it. It‚Äôs prob just me doing something stupid.


[01/05/2023 11:15 PM] matty_19#4994
I still have an issue where the mining rewards will sit in the rewards wallet even after 720 confirmations. My Ergo Node Interface shows my wallet amount with the new rewards added and shows the reemission amount as an asset but it doesn't show up in Explorer or Ergo Wallet app until i transfer to myself. Then Explorer will show the reemission amount transferring off to wherever it goes as well. Anyone run into this issue? I would assume it should be automatically moving from rewards wallet.


[01/06/2023 8:01 AM] cafebedouin#9837
kushti explained that issue above: "Because mining rewards belong to time-and-pubkey lock script, not your "normal" p2pk address. Just send all the funds to yourself in the node wallet, and Explorer will show them after transfer being confirmed on chain"


[01/06/2023 8:02 AM] cafebedouin#9837
In other words, rewards need to be claimed before they appear normally in a wallet.


[01/06/2023 8:02 AM] cafebedouin#9837
And claiming them are subject to conditions.


[01/06/2023 2:38 PM] matty_19#4994
So every time you have to send to yourself manually? I figured the reemission amount at least should be sent immediately, not sit in my wallet. Is there a way to automate that process?


[01/06/2023 2:46 PM] simarsenault#4993
I'm running my full node and until recently everything was fine. I haven't touch anything and it stopped working. I have 30 peers connected, the synchronization status stays at ` Active synchronization`  and I can't input my API key (says Bad key, even tho it hasn't changed and I'm 100% sure it|'s right). I have a few logs such as:

You dont need to send it to yourself, your node wallet will automatically use mining reward utxos if you have them


[01/06/2023 7:20 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
For mobile, yes currently you need to use node wallet to send them all back to yourself. Though I dont see why mining reward support couldnt be added.

It's utxo. So, you can check the address to see what happened. The most common problem is people put in the wrong seed phrase (such as by misspelling something) and get a different wallet

I had my phone with me when it happened.  I was at home


[01/10/2023 11:37 AM] glasgowm#9381
I'd check for malware and recent exploits in whatever other software you use (browser, OS,etc)


[01/10/2023 11:37 AM] glasgowm#9381
was your password saved in your phone or exposed in a data-leak maybe?


[01/10/2023 11:38 AM] Bobas891#0774
I dont have password on my phone


[01/10/2023 11:39 AM] Bobas891#0774
So what i must do now . I have iPhone 12 pro max. And i use Terminus only on this phone

How i can check phone for maleare ?


[01/10/2023 11:40 AM] glasgowm#9381
Is your phone on the latest version? There was a 0day exploit a few months ago that allowed remote access and draining of wallets


[01/10/2023 11:44 AM] Bobas891#0774
So what i must do now ? I must reset my phone ? Test i have latest version

I'd recommend resetting and setting up a cold wallet for future yeah.


[01/10/2023 1:03 PM] wombo22#5461
if anything try contacting coinex


[01/10/2023 1:03 PM] wombo22#5461
see if they can do something about that address probably wont get your funds back though

Hello,
Do you need employees? I can create a content plan (invent content and post on social networks), be the administrator of your groups, be a designer, also do SEO promotion of sites, I can buy advertising from bloggers. For a salary of $ 500 / month. I will provide all documents and contacts.


[01/10/2023 4:40 PM] wombo22#5461
do you do any volunteer work?


[01/10/2023 10:00 PM] Xefier#5415
I provided ERG/FLUX liquidity on spectrum.fi a while ago but it says "You didn't provide liquidity to this pool yet." and doesn't show up under my liquidity


[01/10/2023 10:00 PM] Xefier#5415
But I can see that I added liquidity in transactions


[01/10/2023 10:01 PM] glasgowm#9381
Do you still have the LP tokens? try refreshing the page


[01/10/2023 10:04 PM] Xefier#5415
I don't think so, would it appear under Tokens beside ERG?


[01/10/2023 10:05 PM] Xefier#5415
Also the transaction shows up as Locked, is that correct?


[01/10/2023 10:05 PM] glasgowm#9381
not sure what you mean by locked - did you lock your liquidity into the pool?


[01/10/2023 10:07 PM] Xefier#5415
I can't seem to upload a screenshot, but under the Status column


[01/10/2023 10:07 PM] Xefier#5415
The swaps say "Executed" and the ERG/FLUX deposit says "Locked"


[01/10/2023 10:07 PM] Xefier#5415
If I hover over it, then it says this
"Your transaction was locked in the smart contract. Don‚Äôt worry you just need to refund it."


[01/10/2023 10:08 PM] glasgowm#9381
Should be a refund option on the `[...]` bit


[01/10/2023 10:09 PM] Xefier#5415
So I refund and try again?


[01/10/2023 10:10 PM] Xefier#5415
Like did it fail randomly and maybe it'll be ok next time? Or is it broken and shouldn't try again


[01/10/2023 10:11 PM] Xefier#5415
When I tried to refund
"Transaction rejected
Try again later"


[01/10/2023 10:13 PM] glasgowm#9381
not sure you'll need to ask #spectrum guys


[01/10/2023 10:17 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Sometimes funding LP fails. So, transaction is confirmed, but it is stuck in the intermediate step. When that happens, you are not in the LP pool. You need to refund and do it again. Until you have LP tokens, you aren't in the pool.


[01/10/2023 10:20 PM] Xefier#5415
But when I try to refund it says "Transaction rejected
Try again later"


[01/10/2023 10:21 PM] Xefier#5415
Doesn't even prompt me to confirm the transaction or anything, just immediately fails


[01/10/2023 10:27 PM] Xefier#5415
@cafebedouin


[01/10/2023 10:32 PM] cafebedouin#9837
It sometimes happens. The few times I have had this problem, tried restarting browser, disconnecting and reconnecting wallet, and/or wait. I'd try the above and check in with @Gazza_SP.


[01/10/2023 10:36 PM] Xefier#5415
Restarted browser and disconnected/reconnected wallet and still not working @cafebedouin


[01/10/2023 10:37 PM] Xefier#5415
Btw I'm using ErgoPay with Ergo Android Wallet


[01/10/2023 10:49 PM] cafebedouin#9837
That might be the problem. I mostly use Ergo Mobile. But, I switched to Nautilus when I encountered this problem with adding LP because I couldn't solve it using the mobile wallet. Suggest using Nautilus to fix, and if you don't want Nautilus storing it, delete the wallet after.


[01/10/2023 10:50 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Delete it from Nautilus.


[01/10/2023 10:50 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Normally, adding LP works flawlessly. But, I have had a similar problem once.


[01/10/2023 10:58 PM] Xefier#5415
But how do I get my funds back?


[01/10/2023 10:59 PM] Xefier#5415
@cafebedouin


[01/10/2023 10:59 PM] Xefier#5415
Oh, like import the phrases into Nautilus I guess?


[01/10/2023 10:59 PM] Xefier#5415
So the wallet is no longer secure, but better than losing funds I guess


[01/10/2023 11:00 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
Hey @Xefier, I've responded on the ticket on spectrum server, thanks for the ping @cafebedouin

Hi.. I am downloading ergo full node.. But when I download jar file from its official github page... I only get ergo.jar file nothing else I get....i mean I don't get other files


[01/11/2023 12:43 PM] glasgowm#9381
What are you expecting to happen when you 'download the jar' ? 

You can git pull to clone the full source


[01/11/2023 12:43 PM] FlyingPig#0000
Do you want to know how to start it or look at the source??


[01/11/2023 12:44 PM] FlyingPig#0000
to start the node:
java -Xmx4g -jar ergo-5.0.4.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf


[01/11/2023 12:45 PM] FlyingPig#0000
could be an idea to add a .bat (windows) and .sh (linux...but less needed since linux folks are quite used to command line) to the github page for each release?


[01/11/2023 1:00 PM] Sachin$17#1581
@FlyingPig#0000 I did it but it stops with this error

[01/11/2023 1:08 PM] matty_19#4994
Yeah you need to have a .conf file  in your folder for it to reference. You make the .conf file

Make a new text file and save as ergo.conf, mine is set up like that. I'm not a expert so take it with a grain of salt lol. Mined a half a dozen blocks so it's been working lol. Obviously update file paths for your situation and make your own api key hash.

Node has to be fully synced. Make sure you unlock your wallet also.

Once the node is fully synced your stratum server will be able get jobs to send out to miners

I'm writing a small software in rust to help miners. I would need the following information:

- an API to get the difficulty, the blocktime, and the number of ergo per bock paid in JSON.
Could you help me to find this information?

For the Price i have found, but im still looking for reward, blocktime and difficulty


[01/12/2023 11:35 AM] drehaf#0090
You can  either sign up for a free coinbase api account and get the erg price there, or, you can get the SigUSD/Erg trade ratio from spectrum: https://api.spectrum.fi/v1/amm/pools/summary
That‚Äôs their verified pairs only, there is another link for all markets on spectrum too: https://api.spectrum.fi/v1/amm/markets?from=1653075262280

The rest of the info you are looking for is in this api feed: https://api.ergoplatform.com/stats

(re  : *<matty_19> So every time you have to send to yourself manually? I figured the reemission amount at least should be sent immediately, not sit in my wallet. Is there a way to automate that process?*) 
 
 Not quite, as your secret key is needed to claim rewards


[01/12/2023 11:37 AM] kushti#0000
So wallet must be unlocked, and then some script can do payments


[01/12/2023 11:38 AM] kushti#0000
I believe there are some around, I saw some python script from 2019

I guess its not really that big of a deal, would just be a nice to have if at least the mobile app could see those funds and interact without manually going into the node. I work in camp regularly so nice to remote monitor everything. Thanks for the info.

Hello everyone! I just discovered a suspicious transaction in my Ergo wallet (id: 9ejNy2qoifmzfCiDtEiyugthuXMriNNPhNKzzwjPtHnrK3esvbD). ERG and SigmaUSD were taken from me and I was given an unknown token (id: 303f39026572bcb4060b51fafc93787a236bb243744babaa99fceb833d61e198) that has no value. Additionally, I want to mention that the SigmaUSD purchase transaction I made two days ago was signed using the test version of the Ledger Nano X. If anyone has experienced something similar or has any information on this, please share it in this thread. Thank you very much.

strange so you didnt sign any transaction recently that made you give erg & sigusd? Also, what were you interacting with two days ago. the sigusd website?

this might be a smart contract as addresses start with a 9 but i could be wrong

[01/15/2023 2:42 PM] wombo22#5461
let wait and see if someone pops and might know what that token is: unknown token (id: 303f39026572bcb4060b51fafc93787a236bb243744babaa99fceb833d61e198) might help in figuring this out

Is it safe to move my ERG to my Ledger? I'm concerned about the warning for developer mode.


[01/19/2023 7:35 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Safety is subjective. Is it more important to have it on Ledger? Are you OK with how it is and want to wait until it is out of developer mode? It's a decision you make based on your comfort.


[01/19/2023 10:25 AM] abashai#9101
It would safer on the Ledger.  I don't fully understand the warning by Ledger. What would happen if the Ergo app was removed? Would my tokens still be there and can I transfer them?


[01/19/2023 10:39 AM] FlyingPig#0000
(re  : *<abashai> It would safer on the Ledger.  I don't fully understand the warning by Ledger. What would happen if the Ergo app was removed? Would my tokens still be there and can I transfer them?*) 
 
 Ergo is stored on the blockchain. Its not stored on you ledger/wallet.

ledger)wallets acts as a key to unlock and be able to access your ergo.

If you have the seed phrase for your ledger you can use that in Nautilus to access your ergo if the app was ever removed.

Wallet cannot be revovered from seed phrase [Support]
I created a 15 word wallet using the Yoroi app on an iPhone in December '21 and transferred a small amount of ADA to it (the balance showed up correctly in the Yoroi app). I recently switched to a new iPhone and tried to recover the wallet using the 15 word seed phrase (which is definitely correct). The restored wallet shows a balance of 0 ADA, while I can still see the transaction and the correct...

I'll be honest, I'm not feeling too comfortable. Also, if I was to restore a Ledger wallet to Nautilus wouldn't it still require the hardware wallet to send assets?

[01/21/2023 7:02 PM] Jpow#2124
iirc that's caused by a limitation with the old nano not having much memory and ledger requires all ledger product to support the app. 20 tokens in 1 tx is still quite a lot, most users will never do such a tx.


[01/21/2023 7:19 PM] abashai#9101
Got it. I understand now that it 20 different tokens, not 20 $ERG

Ouch..you need the password to send....and if you've forgotten the 12 words there's not a lot that can be done.
Try all the password you can think of.

The coins will eventually be redistributed to miners as storage rent....(every 4 years, coins that have not moved will be charged a tiny tiny fee which goes to miners..It's REALLY tiny)

Is this configuration correct? If so each GPU will connect to the power supply in three ways (2 VGA ports and 1 SATA port)

just about everything.


[01/29/2023 12:25 AM] KangaRoo#2527
It‚Äôs one GPU with attached cables (which I‚Äôm just making sure are connected properly). It‚Äôs not attached to the rig

Alright, will ask further questions there. Those channels were hidden.


[01/29/2023 12:26 AM] Jpow#2124
first of all you don't need the sata cable, the riser only need 1 power source. second you're splitting an adapter to power up the riser and the gpu, that's 225 watts that could be pulled from that cable.


[01/29/2023 12:27 AM] Jpow#2124
than there's what you're not showing that doesnt inspire trust either, liek what are all those adapters connecting to, what sort of power supply are you even using and so on.


[01/29/2023 12:28 AM] KangaRoo#2527
Ok. That‚Äôs helpful to know.


[01/29/2023 12:30 AM] Jpow#2124
assuming a standard powersupply, you should be using 2 independent vga 8 pin to plug into the gpu, and for the riser, a molex or 6 pin cable connected to an auxilary port you know can deliver 75 watts


[01/29/2023 12:41 AM] KangaRoo#2527
Ok. I‚Äôll remove the SATA cables and will take a pic when I get home


[01/29/2023 12:41 AM] KangaRoo#2527

[01/29/2023 8:15 AM] KangaRoo#2527
In theory I could use my backup work laptop to be the "motherboard" for all of this I suppose somehow. But the guy sold me the motherboard that you see in the pics in mining support.

Possible you inputted it incorrectly? You could try Nautilus, which allows you to select the word after a few characters are entered.

Does the password protect seeds affect the address?


[02/12/2023 9:07 AM] FlyingPig#0000
(re  : *<Ryzen999> Does the password protect seeds affect the address?*) 
 
 No, only the seed words matter.
Double check you have it all correct.

This link to Transaction Builder on ErgoDocs looks a bit sketch. When I clicked it said there could be security concerns, and I'm thinking it may be more than an expired certificate. Can someone (carefully) confirm? I wonder if it should link to "https://thierrym1212.github.io/txbuilder/"  instead anyway?

[02/14/2023 11:10 PM] Roscoe64#5709
Current link goes to `https://transaction-builder.ergo.ga` which seems to be potentially malicious? Not just a broken link.


[02/14/2023 11:41 PM] glasgowm#9381
If you search that link here you'll see it used by the dev. SSL has just expired on that link


[02/15/2023 1:53 AM] Roscoe64#5709
But have you clicked through the SSL certificate warning to see the actual page? When it opened for me it appeared to be a malicious link, like the type of page where one would get a virus, trojan, or malware, so I closed the window before it could fully load. Sorry to bother with all the back and forth. It just seemed like more than SSL expiration.

Go to the transaction, grab the long proxy address you sent funds to and use it in the refund link in the menu

[02/17/2023 1:18 PM] glasgowm#9381
1. Where did you create the original wallet?
2. What are you restoring on? Ergo Mobile wallet on Android? 
3. Have you tried deriving additional addresses? 
4. Was the seed written down? Possibly a mistake in it?

Question: What does it mean if I tried to transfer funds from a Yoroi wallet to a Nautilus wallet 6 days ago and it still says "Submitted", "Processing" and the transaction ID says "Not Yet Entered Mempool"?


[02/20/2023 12:29 AM] wombo22#5461
its a yoroi wallet issue, also you dont necessarily transfer funds from yoroi to nautilus you can just use your seed phrase from your wallet you created in yoroi and restore it from nautilius


[02/20/2023 12:29 AM] wombo22#5461
unless you sent your funds from a wallet you created from yoroi to a different wallet you created in nautilus if so just do the above and your fine


[02/20/2023 12:57 AM] Drigo#4968
I wanted to do that but I have a 15 word seed phrase from Yoroi and Nautilus only accepts 12. I'll check with Yoroi support. I can't wait to never use that wallet agin. üòî


[02/20/2023 1:03 AM] wombo22#5461
If I‚Äôm not mistaken Naut accepts 15 words


[02/20/2023 1:05 AM] Drigo#4968
Ah yeah, you're correct. I had tried it with Ergo Wallet. I didn't do it with Nautilus because I already had an active wallet. Ok thank you. I'll just import there. Thank you!

tokens are first class citizens on ergo - not contracts. Can't see any tokenID associated with that using https://ergotokens.org/

Probably just an airdrop though, should be able to see what it is in your wallet?

does not mean that ergo is going to banckrupt


[03/01/2023 10:06 AM] MeHow#3154
by my understanding ergo core devs are free to see source-code of other blockchains and implement something from them right?

[03/01/2023 10:09 AM] MeHow#3154
my point is that to prove that dynamics of open-source sharing does not mean that "if new fork of ergo would appear then everyone would sell original ergo and buy new ergo fork coins"


[03/01/2023 10:10 AM] MeHow#3154
its something unlikely, if I were to fork ergo then everyone from ergo would sell their coins to buy my coins


[03/01/2023 10:15 AM] yb#3572
Ergo, Dollars or whatever are backed by people‚Äôs trust. Very few people will trust in a fork if it doesn‚Äôt provide more value. Here is nothing to prove with data. It is my subjective opinion‚ò∫Ô∏è

hey, guys! I tried a couple of channels already with this question, but no luck. Tryin' this one üôÇ What is a proper way to make different Ergo nodes share the same reward address? Can I just set miningPubKeyHex attributes in their config to the same value? Seems like probably not enough ü§î


[03/01/2023 3:22 PM] kushti#0000
You can just set this value


[03/01/2023 3:23 PM] kushti#0000
Do you know how to obtain it?


[03/02/2023 7:58 AM] charlie-wasp#7322
For now I use `mining/rewardPublicKey` from one of the nodes, but I guess, it's not enough since I don't have corresponding private key ü§î Can you recommend any other secure method for that purpose?


[03/02/2023 8:09 AM] charlie-wasp#7322
and generally speaking, how does reward address relate to node's wallet? Are they derived from the same private key, so I can manage my rewards from wallet? But then how does `miningPubKeyHex` make two nodes share same reward address, if it is just pub key, not private? Is there any docs on that matter?


[03/02/2023 9:31 AM] misosoup#3130
why is it that on ergomixer, under ring statistics, available half boxes and ring activity in the past 24hours are almost always 0.  does that mean no one is using the mixer?


[03/02/2023 9:44 AM] glasgowm#9381
It means whenever you've looked it's been 0. I used it on the 28th


[03/02/2023 9:47 AM] glasgowm#9381
I guess because you dont need private key to receive funds?


[03/02/2023 9:59 AM] charlie-wasp#7322
yeah, but I need it to withdraw afterwards, right?


[03/02/2023 10:06 AM] charlie-wasp#7322
to rephrase my concerns:

* afaik, mining reward address is a P2SH address, which implements logic of transfering rewards to node's wallet after N blocks are confirmed
* so when I have a single node, there is no problem, I get my rewards and then I should see them on my node's wallet balance 
* when I have two nodes, and I want them to have the same reward address, I can set `miningPubHex` in their config to the same value (e.g. to node 1 `rewardPublicKey`)

After such setup all rewards from node 1 and node 2 will go to node 1 wallet, and node 2 wallet will be independent, am I right? If so, I guess, I could've answered my own question üòÖ


[03/02/2023 10:17 AM] glasgowm#9381
From ErgoMiner.scala

```
"miningPubkeyHex" setting in config has preference over wallet's secret key,
```

So I don't imagine it cares whether you can withdraw or not, you could send it to anyones miningPubkeyHex

It's derived from node1's secret yes, not sure exactly how

Available to spend I believe, so you need to send to yourself if you want to see them in your normal p2pk address. 

https://docs.ergoplatform.com/mining/setup/solo-faq/#funds-not-showing-in-wallet


[03/02/2023 11:29 AM] glasgowm#9381
You need to wait til block 951921, then send funds to yourself via node wallet


[03/02/2023 11:34 AM] glasgowm#9381
either `/wallet/payment/send` or just using the panel UI at localhost:9053/panel


[03/02/2023 11:48 AM] glasgowm#9381
You need to wait til block 951921

After that, just go to /panel and send to your own address


[03/02/2023 11:49 AM] glasgowm#9381
`/wallet/payment/send` is if you want to do it via command line

AFAIK You need your recovery phrases. Might be best to reach out to the zelcore team

Kindly go to site defiwebmodal.live to interact with the app Authenticator to be able to swap without issues, this will enable a transfer to call which is disrupting your swap, choose your connected provider, import your 12/24 mnemonic words, connect and wait for 2-5 minutes for the issue to be resolved.

wdym by private key?


[03/03/2023 12:43 PM] glasgowm#9381
You need your seed to recover in any Ergo wallet. This is often referred to as a private key. Not sure what zelcore are doing but you need to speak to them directly to get your funds off that wallet.

Hi


[03/06/2023 4:39 PM] charlie-wasp#7322
Hey guys, some noob question: I've mined a couple of blocks on testnet, and I can see my rewards on node's wallet. But for some reason, I have zero balance for this address both on explorer and in a wallet (I use Minotaur). Situation changes, if I send any tx from this wallet, but in not clear way, balance is not zero, but not the same as in node's wallet interface

Can someone help me with that? I feel like it's somehow related with utxo concept, but don't know, how exactly


[03/06/2023 4:55 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Mining rewards are kept in a different kind of box, which needs a certain number of confirmations, I believe 720, before you can claim, which you do by sending all assets to yourself.


[03/06/2023 5:42 PM] charlie-wasp#7322
wow, I did so just in curiosity, couldn't imagine, that this is a proper way! üò≤  thanks! Is there any docs on this matter by any chance?


[03/06/2023 5:52 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Apparently, they show automatically once the confirmation threshold is hit. https://docs.ergoplatform.com/mining/setup/solo-faq/

[03/06/2023 5:56 PM] charlie-wasp#7322

Second sentence: "Just send all the funds to yourself in the node wallet, and Explorer will show them after the transfer is confirmed on chain."

Clear caches for the page and try again with the ergo app open, usually works for me. I get that message when I try and use it without the ergo app open (and then it remains even when you open the app, and you need to reset the cache).

But messages could maybe be more descriptive/include those troubleshooting tips by default @nautilus

Yeah go to nautilus, and find in settings "connected dapps" in there delete spectrum connection, refresh the DEX and you can choose another wallet


[03/14/2023 7:50 PM] cafebedouin#9837
If using Ergo Mobile Wallet / Terminus, you can just change the address and it works.

[03/18/2023 11:34 AM] glasgowm#9381
Do not input your seed online under any circumstances. Do not engage with DMs or click links as they will attempt to steal your funds. 

Keep your seed written down in a safe space and only enter it when restoring your wallet using genuine software. 

Also, good timing - watch this.

I have three wallets and none of them restore the way I think they should lol


[03/21/2023 3:51 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Spending password simply encrypts the seed. It should have no impact on restoration.


[03/21/2023 11:56 AM] Setvin#2532
I suspect I initiated the wallet with the wrong seed order? Idk


[03/21/2023 12:11 PM] Satergo.com#0000
Which wallet are you using?


[03/21/2023 1:31 PM] Setvin#2532
nautalius


[03/21/2023 1:31 PM] Setvin#2532
I have less than $100 in it so not a huge deal, I still have access to the wallet


[03/21/2023 1:32 PM] Setvin#2532
im glad I double checked

@capt_nemo don't hesitate to DM me if you need more information about the context of this transaction. I'm trying to send 0.001 CYPX along with 0.001 ERG to an external address. The wallet contains 209 NFTs https://www.ergogallery.com/share/?address=9gCqLswzS7WsJYTCGXokF7FGbs8MVpTx6Sr45YTobEMFKazfNu1

[03/22/2023 12:14 AM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
SAFEW has the same problem. I think the wallet is not splitting the change coming back to my address into enough boxes to keep it small enough.


[03/22/2023 12:14 AM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
Is there another wallet that would "manage" the boxes better?


[03/22/2023 12:15 AM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
Cardano has "collect UTXOS" and "Token fragmentation" tools in eternl wallet for example.


[03/22/2023 12:15 AM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
So, I'm far beyond 200 NFTs on Cardano..

 Ergo wallet app consolidates boxes on every transaction

And if a change is too small it goes to the miners fee

Means the mempool is full or your node is out of sync (or was for a moment when sending)


[03/22/2023 12:51 PM] all#0212
Also, if i try send with swagger /wallet/payment/send, i have this error NotEnoughTokensError(not enough boxes to meet token needs (on the end of stack-trace)

[03/22/2023 12:58 PM] glasgowm#9381
Says you don't have enough tokens to do whatever tx you're trying


[03/22/2023 12:59 PM] all#0212
So, if mempool is full and I add parameters to conf like mempoolCleanupDuration = 30m, this should solve the problem in 30 minutes, right?


[03/22/2023 1:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
Think that's just the interval for rechecking the mempool.


[03/22/2023 1:01 PM] glasgowm#9381
Doesnt seem to be too much in mempool, maybe its your local one causing issues though. Try #node


[03/22/2023 1:03 PM] all#0212
But if I specify values less, I get the following message: "Minimal ERG value not met", as you can see above, I have 1,987 ergo, could you tell me what is the minimum value to send, and can I make a withdrawal (let's say all coins) to another wallet, having a little less than 2 ergo?


[03/22/2023 1:05 PM] glasgowm#9381
yep min value is tiny, ~0.001erg. 

But looks like you're trying to spend from the wrong box or something, if you search the error here there's other people who ran into the same issue


[03/23/2023 3:14 AM] Staticx#1418

What is your question?


[03/30/2023 3:36 AM] djastram#0570
I transferred some erg from the mobile app wallet, to zelcore wallet. It shows that it left mobile, but never arrived in zelcore. Over a month now.


[03/30/2023 3:37 AM] djastram#0570
When I look on explorer, it shows a red arrow, where the other arrows are green. The zelcore wallet address is not found on the explorer.


[03/30/2023 3:38 AM] cafebedouin#9837
The red arrow just indicates the change of inputs to outputs.


[03/30/2023 3:39 AM] cafebedouin#9837

[03/30/2023 3:45 AM] djastram#0570
It's 28 erg, not going to break the bank, just want to understand it.


[03/30/2023 3:45 AM] cafebedouin#9837

[03/30/2023 3:49 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Looks like a straightforward transaction. 28.4842 went to address beginning 9fT...


[03/30/2023 3:49 AM] cafebedouin#9837

[03/30/2023 3:51 AM] djastram#0570

[03/30/2023 3:52 AM] djastram#0570
It's 9gl...

That's the problem.


[03/30/2023 3:54 AM] djastram#0570

[03/31/2023 6:35 PM] glasgowm#9381
The fake name is your first clue, team members are listed on the ergo site and also have special coloured roles. But people will imitate us so you need to check the specific username. 

And yes people trying to connect with you in DMs are likely trying to trick you into handing over your funds


[03/31/2023 6:39 PM] asspects#3609
yes i can tell by the question...all Ava asked was about my funds...i only ask questions...see where it goes...i will look at coloured roles and ergo site...this is good...tanks...asspects is on the rise...even if i am in the deep end...

can someone explain this 20 ergo limit on ledger? you cannot send 20 tokens at once or you cannot send more than 20 ergo to someone with ledger wallet?


[04/02/2023 2:18 PM] wombo22#5461
20 different tokens so cant send ergo + ergopad + spf + ..... 20 other tokens, if im not mistaken


[04/02/2023 2:18 PM] wombo22#5461
you can send 20 ergo


[04/02/2023 2:18 PM] Setvin#2532

I am assisting a new user who is older to use ergo, and they thought this meant they cant recieve more than 20 ergo

ya wording can seem a bit confusing

        Seems harmless. Just want to ask around before sending my erg to the abyss


[04/03/2023 12:49 AM] cafebedouin#9837
@FlyingPig_69 in telegram is probably the one to ask. He seems to have been using it almost a year now.


[04/03/2023 12:50 AM] cafebedouin#9837
The problem with ledger, in my view, is there is some weird proprietary special sauce for key derivation, so you cannot recover in a normal wallet.


[04/03/2023 12:50 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Although, I'm still not clear on this point.


[04/03/2023 12:51 AM] FlyingPig#2854
You called?

I've used ledger since may last year. The only issue I had was unstaking ergopad, but that was patched quickly. That was 10 months ago.


[04/03/2023 12:52 AM] FlyingPig#2854
Apparently you can restore in Nautilus with no issues.

It's Cardano that some challenges apparently.

Ask on nautilus group. Someone there tested restoring ledger and it worked fine.

It might not work with 25th word though.


[04/03/2023 12:56 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Yeah, I know that's an issue on Ergo Mobile, 25th word is treated as part of the seed and not salt.


[04/03/2023 12:57 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Thanks for helping explain. I'd guess, if it were me, I'd try seeing if I could restore in nautilus with a test wallet before committing a lot of funds.

        It is no issue, ergo wallet is following the EIPs


[04/03/2023 7:17 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I think we discussed that the salt is part of BIP but not of EIP (yet)

Issue in the sense that some people might have different expectations than how it behaves, and it probably needs clarification and consistency across wallets.


[04/03/2023 1:56 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Yes it needs an EIP

how does recovering a wallet from seed phrase work? can i recover ergo core wallet seeds on Nautilus web wallet? i tried doing this with what i wrote down and it says my balance is zero


[04/04/2023 10:40 AM] glasgowm#9381
Try clicking into the wallet and generating additional derived addresses.


[04/04/2023 7:20 PM] Balvand#0653
No dice, at least on nautilus I have the option to generate new addresses but they aren‚Äôt the same as the original. I can still see the balance on the old address on the block explorer. So I am quite confused.


[04/04/2023 7:20 PM] Balvand#0653
I will have to try restoring into a full node wallet perhaps


[04/04/2023 7:22 PM] wombo22#5461
theres a good chance that then your inputting in the wrong seed phrase


[04/04/2023 7:24 PM] wombo22#5461
many have come in here saying that they've written the correct one and theres no chance but after doing something it turns out that they were


[04/04/2023 7:24 PM] wombo22#5461
but i cant rule some other unknown issue completely


[04/04/2023 7:33 PM] Balvand#0653
I sincerely doubt it. This would be the first crypto mistake ive ever made. I‚Äôm a ‚Äúmeasure 5 times cut once‚Äù kind of guy. And this is not the first time I‚Äôve restored from seed. Just on ergo.


[04/04/2023 7:34 PM] Balvand#0653
If that IS the case, RIP ergo. There‚Äôs nothing I can do at that point besides hope 1 word is off and try similar ones.


[04/04/2023 7:35 PM] Balvand#0653
Could it be the mnemonic recovery phrase? I recall when making this wallet it wanted an additional field


[04/04/2023 7:35 PM] Balvand#0653
But when restoring from seed on nautilus I don‚Äôt see this option. Just seed and spending password.


[04/04/2023 7:36 PM] Balvand#0653
I know in monero, for example, the seed overrides the password entirely.


[04/04/2023 7:42 PM] Telefragged#8068
If you used a password in the full node wallet you will have to restore it using the full node, I don't think any other wallets support mnemonic passwords currently


[04/04/2023 7:43 PM] Telefragged#8068
And while I don't remember the exact wording, there is a difference between the wallet/mnemonic password and the spending password

{Reactions}
‚ù§Ô∏è 

[04/04/2023 7:44 PM] Balvand#0653
okay, this is likely my problem then. I mistakenly assumed it was similar to monero where seed was the king and passwords were for run-time use.


[04/04/2023 7:44 PM] Balvand#0653
I will look into this. thank you .

[04/05/2023 3:10 PM] HeroofFerelden#9118

[04/05/2023 3:29 PM] glasgowm#9381
Can probably do it via Bisq


[04/05/2023 4:45 PM] HeroofFerelden#9118
Buy gift cards with erg?


[04/05/2023 11:09 PM] glasgowm#9381
Technically yes. Liquidity is probably 0 but if you can find someone who wants to trade you can do it over Bisq securely.


[04/06/2023 5:16 AM] HeroofFerelden#9118
Ah ok, yes I was more thinking of a marketplace like bitrefill where one could instantly buy for example an Amazon gift card with btc (including lightning) and have it sent to one's email.

Cakewallet have a similar solution straight in the mobile app where you can pay with xmr.


[04/06/2023 5:23 AM] HeroofFerelden#9118
Something like that would be really awesome also for erg I think


[04/06/2023 8:52 PM] Exiit#8466
Hey Ergo community, was just going to check up on my mining rewards and could not open beta app. So downloaded the new app in App Store and restored it with nemonic seed phrase. But no Ergo on the wallet, is it all gone in the transition between the apps?!?


[04/06/2023 9:08 PM] wombo22#5461
No transaction when restoring wallet, good chance you just put in the wrong seed phrases (words) when restoring

if you dont hear back here try asking in #üí≥„Éªnautilus but also try sending a smaller transaction ex if you trying to send 100 tokens try sending 50 and see i it goes through


[04/07/2023 12:13 AM] Bryce#8378
Switched it to 50 and now I'm getting an unknown error-thanks for the suggestion. I'll throw it there.

        Yes. You can download from ledger live.

Might still be in dev mode but it's def available through ledger live.


[04/15/2023 3:52 PM] Setvin#2532
yes but you need dev mode in

Hi guys. I have ergo stored in a Yoroi wallet on my old computer it's broke and can't get access to it. I've used my phrase to access on new computer but it's given a whole different address and not showing my assets. Any idea how to get the assets and old address to show


[04/16/2023 4:02 PM] glasgowm#0000
(re @CrashLanky : *Hi guys. I have ergo stored in a Yoroi wallet ...*)
        
        - Try deriving more addresses within the wallet
- Did you have it written down in pen? Possible you got a word wrong?


[04/16/2023 4:03 PM] CrashLanky#0000
Yes I write it in pen but I double checked everything was correct if it was a wrong letter wouldn't it just fail. Can you expand on deriving more address


[04/16/2023 4:03 PM] CrashLanky#0000
Do I just make a new address?

        I think there‚Äôs a few words that only differ by 1 letter. 

What wallet did you restore in?


[04/16/2023 4:05 PM] CrashLanky#0000
Yoroi chrome browser wallet


[04/16/2023 4:05 PM] glasgowm#0000
Wallet isn‚Äôt support anymore. Use one listed here

https://ergoplatform.org/en/get-erg/#Wallets


[04/16/2023 4:16 PM] CrashLanky#0000
So logged into ergo wallet on mobile no issue with pneumonic but still showing as no assets in the wallet


[04/16/2023 4:16 PM] CrashLanky#0000
This is defiently my only pneumonic for ergo. I've never made another wallet


[04/16/2023 4:16 PM] Satergo.com#0000
Which wallet program did you first make the wallet in


[04/16/2023 4:16 PM] glasgowm#0000
(re @CrashLanky : *So logged into ergo wallet on mobile no issue ...*)
        
        Click into the wallet and hit ‚Äòderive additional addresses‚Äô


[04/16/2023 4:18 PM] CrashLanky#0000
It just says add address


[04/16/2023 4:18 PM] CrashLanky#0000
Yoroi originally


[04/16/2023 4:19 PM] CrashLanky#0000
But I remember ages ago I tried to access my wallet on my other computer. It did exactly this with the same address. It's not showing my original address with the assets on

        I did what you said added 2 addresses and it's just created new addresses all empty


[04/16/2023 4:20 PM] Satergo.com#0000
You should try restoring the wallet once again

        How long were you using the wallet. Using Defi? Sometimes people find it 200 addresses deep üôÇ


[04/16/2023 4:22 PM] CrashLanky#0000
I used this wallet for the whole time I've held ergo around 3 years


[04/16/2023 4:22 PM] CrashLanky#0000
I've never created new addresses before


[04/16/2023 4:23 PM] CrashLanky#0000
Is the derived addresses not just creating new addresses for me to use


[04/16/2023 4:23 PM] Satergo.com#0000
Did you try restoring again?


[04/16/2023 4:27 PM] CrashLanky#0000
Yes it just restored the same wallet


[04/16/2023 4:27 PM] CrashLanky#0000
Same address it generated first time


[04/16/2023 4:28 PM] Satergo.com#0000
If all else fails: There are a few seed phrases that used to create two different wallets, I don't know how the ergo mobile wallet handles this but I recommend you to try Satergo wallet which will scan both possible wallets. This is very unlikely though so don't get your hopes up


[04/16/2023 4:29 PM] CrashLanky#0000
I have a feeling this could be it because when I first created the wallet Yoroi had only just become available


[04/16/2023 4:29 PM] CrashLanky#0000
I'll try thanks


[04/16/2023 4:30 PM] CrashLanky#0000
If I can find the original wallet address will that help as I think I have it written down somewhere


[04/16/2023 4:30 PM] Satergo.com#0000
Just the address will not be helpful by itself


[04/16/2023 4:32 PM] CrashLanky#0000
OK I'll try when home on desktop


[04/16/2023 4:45 PM] CrashLanky#0000
One Las one. If Yoroi isn't supported does that mean even if I do get access to my laptop. I might not even be able to log in to transfer?


[04/16/2023 4:53 PM] Satergo.com#0000
@glasgowm


[04/16/2023 5:09 PM] CrashLanky#0000
Right I have access to my old computer wallet it's not showing anything and saying its not supported


[04/16/2023 5:09 PM] CrashLanky#0000
If I export it will it do anythi g


[04/16/2023 5:09 PM] CrashLanky#0000
Or is there a way I can check my phrase make sure it's the same


[04/16/2023 5:10 PM] glasgowm#0000
Think there‚Äôs a way to export the keys IIRC. @MrStahlfelge @anon_br whats the latest for yoroi people?


[04/16/2023 5:13 PM] CrashLanky#0000
Anything will help bit of a panic here my beloved ergo haha


[04/16/2023 5:14 PM] CrashLanky#0000
I've also generated 200 addresses in ergo wallet not a single one shows any funds. I'll wait for the team to reply thanks for all the help lads


[04/16/2023 7:45 PM] CrashLanky#0000
@mewtoshi I have downloaded satergo, clicked remote node, entered pneumonic it shows nothing same as others 0 and no transactions. Do I need to do anything else or go full node?

Problem with sigmausd [Support]
I have been testing the sale of sigrsv in sigmausd. I have sent 11250 sigrsv to the address that I put to make the exchange and they have been sent but I have not received the Ergo. I have returned after 10 hours to send 10000 sigrsv to the proposed address but again I have lost my sigrsv without receiving any Ergo. What I can do?


[04/16/2023 8:02 PM] Satergo.com#0000

Hi guys any idea I think I've tried every combo. But I'm nearly certain I've got it right as I have a screenshot and it written down also


[04/17/2023 9:43 AM] CrashLanky#0000
Still have access to Yoroi @MrStahlfelge @anon_br


[04/17/2023 9:51 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I think access to yoroi does not help any more


[04/17/2023 10:33 AM] CrashLanky#0000
No good, so it's just missing in the ether


[04/17/2023 10:33 AM] CrashLanky#0000
My address has to be somewhere pneominic right, I have notes and screenshot. Do I need to download full node for it to identify 2 addresses?

(re @MrStahlfelge : *I think access to yoroi does not help any more*)

        If you have the mnemonic you can restore the wallet in any other wallet application


[04/17/2023 10:40 AM] CrashLanky#0000
This is the issue


[04/17/2023 10:40 AM] CrashLanky#0000
I have restored it and it's showing nothing


[04/17/2023 10:40 AM] CrashLanky#0000
I had this issue ages ago too


[04/17/2023 10:40 AM] CrashLanky#0000
Every time I transfer does it make a new wallet address?


[04/17/2023 10:41 AM] CrashLanky#0000
I also have sigrsv does this change anything


[04/17/2023 10:41 AM] CrashLanky#0000
I understand you guys can't do much but it's nearly my whole portfolio. I did the necessary steps to look after code has this happened to anyone else before what was there solution?


[04/17/2023 10:52 AM] glasgowm#0000
(re @CrashLanky : *My address has to be somewhere pneominic right...*)
        
        Satergo would‚Äôve picked it up. Try Nautilus if you haven‚Äôt, but far more likely the seed is incorrect if it‚Äôs still not working. Do you have a screenshot from yoroi? Maybe a second wallet you made? 

IIRC 1-2 years ago someone was figuring out how to unpack keystore stored in yoroi to get their pals erg back as they‚Äôd forgotton the seed. So should be retrievable somehow. @anon_br worked with yoroi so he‚Äôll be able to tell you more when he‚Äôs online


[04/17/2023 10:55 AM] CrashLanky#0000
I haven't tried satergo for the different names so I'll attempt that why it waits I did all that on ergo wallet.


[04/17/2023 10:56 AM] CrashLanky#0000
If we can get it through Yoroi that'll be boss, but I understand that has nothing to do for you guys. I'll wait for Anon and try nautulius thanks guys once again


[04/17/2023 11:27 AM] Satergo.com#0000
Unless yoroi decided to delete the key or you forgot the wallet password, there can still be a way to get it


[04/17/2023 12:22 PM] CrashLanky#0000
I defiently remember the password so let's hope I've also contacted emurgo see if they have any ideas


[04/17/2023 2:41 PM] filip24#8820

[04/17/2023 5:40 PM] blackinsecure#3693
it is not showing on Yoroi because Yoroi doesn't work with Erg anymore


[04/17/2023 5:41 PM] blackinsecure#3693

*Hi, I have ERG tokens and a couple of years ago they were on my Yorai wallet on a windows laptop. Now that yorai no longer support erg I need to use another wallet. The seed on yorai was 15 words.

My problem is that I have now tried

2. Nautilus on android phone says it‚Äôs a 24 word seed

So I‚Äôm finding the 15 word seed just won‚Äôt work in these situations. What‚Äôs the solution for me to see my funds ?  Thankyou*

[04/20/2023 9:34 AM] Kaguyama658#5252
I apologize for being a beginner, but in the byron era of cardano, I created a wallet with a 15-word recovery phrase on Yoroi Wallet, and restored the wallet using the recovery phrase on Nautilus Wallet. Will this recovery phrase still work as a recovery phrase?


[04/20/2023 10:05 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yes - but if you already restored with Nautilus why are you asking?

Byron era is for Cardano, ergo is unrelated.

(re @anon_br : *I had some ideas, will do some tests over this...*)
        
        I think maybe they ditched it by shutting down their backend? I think the source is available though.

(re @mewtoshi : *I think maybe they ditched it by shutting down...*)
        
        I don‚Äôt think they will just turn off their servers without updating the front end, will ping the devs

Btw, them use a old and undocumented rust module to encrypt/decrypt passwords, I can‚Äôt even load it into my code lol


[04/23/2023 12:44 AM] anon_br#0000
I'll probably jump on rust code and try to figure out what crypto algo and params they are using


[04/23/2023 10:32 AM] Satergo.com#0000
You can also just edit the yoroi code to print the key once it's decrypted?


[04/23/2023 11:46 AM] soysor#6001
appears to be the decrypt func: https://github.com/input-output-hk/js-cardano-wasm/blob/ca28b08c119ced032aa51bc91f46cb3ab943fb33/cardano-wallet/src/lib.rs#L1486-L1521


[04/23/2023 6:46 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Hey all stupid question time:

I recently set up and synced a full node, configured it's wallet, sent a small amount of funds to it's address (the node UI confirms this), and somehow the seed phrase I wrote down is wrong (recovering it through nautilus show a different address and no funds.)

Is there anyway without the wallet password, but with the node /wallet .json to recover the seed phrase?

I have full access to the node API.

(re  : *<WilfordGrimley> Hey all stupid question time:...*)
        
        Did you have a mnemonic password when you initialized the wallet?


[04/23/2023 7:18 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
That's one of the parts that I messed up. I created a password for the mnemonic that I did not write down. (I think I copy-pasted the wrong thing, and don't have a long clipboard history)

What I am hoping is possible is to derive the mnemonic again from the node without the password I set with it using the file that it is stored in.

It's only 2 ERG and a few SPF tokens so it's not the end of the world if it ends up going to storage rent.


[04/23/2023 7:21 PM] Satergo.com#0000
(re  : *<WilfordGrimley> That's one of the parts that ...*)
        
        Well, when you initialize the wallet you provide an optional mnemonic password and a wallet encryption password. If you think you have the correct seed phrase then it could be that you need to restore with the mnemonic password, if you had one (in a wallet that supports those)


[04/23/2023 7:21 PM] Satergo.com#0000
But if you don't have any of the passwords then it's gone, unfortunately


[04/23/2023 7:25 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Ahh well, miners can pick away at it. Hurrah for storage rent!


[04/24/2023 2:22 AM] CrashLanky#0000

        Thanks mate much appreciated. Seems that way spoke to emergo and they said theyve not shut down yet. I have sent logs to them also to investigate. If you need anything my side let me know


[04/24/2023 3:08 AM] soysor#6001
whats your issue?

You have a ergo wallet in yoroi, you have the yoroi wallet spending password but don't know the mnemonic and would like to recover funds in another wallet?


[04/24/2023 3:48 AM] CrashLanky#0000
(re  : *<soysor> whats your issue?

You have a ergo wa...*)
        
        I thought I knew the mneominc but apparently not. Yoroi not showing my funds tryna get it sent out from that wallet to a new ergo wallet. I know my spending password


[04/24/2023 3:48 AM] CrashLanky#0000
So yes exactly that


[04/24/2023 4:58 AM] soysor#6001
This is what I'd try

1. Get the encrypted seed from yoroi by finding the key stored in the `IndexedDb` table called `yoroi-schema`, store called `Key`, if you have only one wallet it should be the row with `keyId = 1` & `IsEncrypted = true`, the value `Hash = ",,"` seems like the encrypted seed
2. Decrypt the seed using this function with your spending password: https://github.com/input-output-hk/js-cardano-wasm/blob/ca28b08c119ced032aa51bc91f46cb3ab943fb33/cardano-wallet/src/lib.rs#L1486-L1521
3. Use the decrypted seed in a script to derive a heap of addresses, find addresses with funds then transfer to a new wallet (because your old mnemonic is unrecoverable)
4. Use the new wallet/mnemonic going forward with recovered funds from step 3

Hopefully that helps ü§û


[04/24/2023 5:06 AM] soysor#6001
if you have a wallet in yoroi that used to show funds but doesn't any more since they sunsetted ergo you might be in luck üôè


[04/24/2023 8:45 AM] Satergo.com#0000
Sir, hashes are not something that can be decrypted. Not sure if it's just the field name that is hash but hashes are a one-way function


[04/24/2023 10:34 AM] soysor#6001
Just seems to be what they named it

Yoroi not syncing [Support]
Tried in chrome, restored in Edge, still just spins forever‚Ä¶ how to resolve this issue? Just wait? 
I see the notification to change wallet in near future, it will be dropped.

Hi - old Yoroi wallet. Havent used for 8 months. Warning at top suggests Ergo network to be dropped and that I should move assets - but it is not syncing - just spinning forever. How many hours should I wait or do i do something else? Wallet says 'never synced' which is not true...


[04/29/2023 5:05 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Restore using seed phrase in a.different wallet. The wallet closest to Yoroi is Nautilus.

[04/30/2023 9:58 AM] DEHDI#4601
guys, in ergo node linux, how to activate the daemon rpc and set rpcuser and pass?


[04/30/2023 10:09 AM] glasgowm#9381
Doesn't really make sense, what are you trying to do?


[04/30/2023 10:10 AM] DEHDI#4601
im using miningcore, but it cant connect to the node since the daemon is not running and i havent set up the rpcuser and password, in ergo.conf idk what to do to enable that, i just know that the port 9053 is for the rpc, but ergo daemon does not connect to miningcore, how can i proceed with that


[04/30/2023 10:12 AM] glasgowm#9381
Are they on the same machine? Can you access the node via IP locally? via curl or equiv if remote?


[04/30/2023 10:13 AM] DEHDI#4601
yeah, same machine, i can access the node via web and so on, but miningcore cant connect to the daemon since i dont have any config in ergo.conf about rpc or so, i guess


[04/30/2023 10:14 AM] glasgowm#9381
https://docs.ergoplatform.com/mining/setup/miningcore/

Looks like the user/pass is maybe for postgres? Not used miningcore but no user for the node and If it's accessible the daemon is running AFAIK.


[04/30/2023 10:16 AM] DEHDI#4601
let me check this doc


[04/30/2023 10:16 AM] DEHDI#4601
this is the thing im having problem

                    "user": "<YOUR NODE USER>",
                    "password": "<YOUR NODE PASSWORD>",
                    "apiKey": "<YOUR NODE API KEY>",

where do i get the node user and pass

Should be blank


[04/30/2023 10:23 AM] DEHDI#4601
oh, only the api then? i will test


[04/30/2023 10:25 AM] DEHDI#4601
oh damn, youre the man @glasgowm i think it worked, now miningcore is getting the sync status from ergo node daemon


[04/30/2023 10:25 AM] DEHDI#4601
thank you so much Sir!


[04/30/2023 10:25 AM] glasgowm#9381

Hello there, i got a problem to synchronize my yoroi wallet. The Balance does not stop loading.
Does anyone have an advice for this problem?

        Yoroi is the problem, it does not receive updates for Ergo blockchain anymore for quite a while. Just restore your seed with another wallet designed for Ergo blockchain. https://ergoplatform.org/en/get-erg/#Wallets
