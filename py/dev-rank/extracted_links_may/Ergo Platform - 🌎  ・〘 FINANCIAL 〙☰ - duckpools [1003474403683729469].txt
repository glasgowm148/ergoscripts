Hi!


[09/01/2022 3:56 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Is it possible to share a link to the duckpools discord here @glasgowm


[09/01/2022 4:25 PM] glasgowm#9381
of course, I can bridge this chat too if you'd like


[09/02/2022 9:18 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Yeah I think that would be a good idea too üôÇ DM me the details of any bot you need to add


[09/02/2022 2:12 PM] jhon_moio#2140
I Wanted to know how will be the apy be paid?


[09/02/2022 2:12 PM] jhon_moio#2140
In ergo or duck Pool tokens?


[09/02/2022 2:15 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Currently there is no duck pool token. All initial versions of the protocol will pay pool earnings in the pool's currency. So for the ERG pool, earnings are received as ERG.


[09/02/2022 2:18 PM] jhon_moio#2140
And that payment comes from the Pool fees?


[09/02/2022 2:21 PM] jhon_moio#2140
Are you a duck Pool dev?


[09/02/2022 2:24 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Currently it comes directly from repaid loans, so earnings are not realised until loans are repaid/ liquidated. At scale the difference between receiving continuous earnings and actual earnings (receiving when loans are settled) is likely to be miniscule. That said, setting up some smart contracts to fund the pull continuously using active loan data would make this more seamless


[09/02/2022 2:24 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Yes üôÇ


[09/02/2022 2:25 PM] jhon_moio#2140
I like the idea of a non emissive protocol


[09/02/2022 2:25 PM] jhon_moio#2140
Like $Kujira


[09/02/2022 2:25 PM] jhon_moio#2140
Do u know it?


[09/02/2022 2:26 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
I don't actually, just googling it now!


[09/02/2022 2:27 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
What emissions are you referring to here?


[09/02/2022 2:27 PM] jhon_moio#2140
Many defi protocol pays highers apy with their protocol tokens


[09/02/2022 2:28 PM] jhon_moio#2140
Which comes from emission


[09/02/2022 2:29 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Oh yes, in that case I would consider myself in favour of non-emissive protocols too.


[09/02/2022 2:31 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
I think its important to align with the core values of Ergo and an emissive protocol to me seems like a step away from the core values


[09/02/2022 2:33 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
That said, things are very early and I don't want duckpools to commit to any one structure just yet üôÇ The primary focus at this stage is to produce a solid foundation for the protocol.


[09/02/2022 2:33 PM] jhon_moio#2140
Kujira is a l1 protocol, but has $orca where you can buy tokens at a liquidation price from liquidated loans, Fin that is a dex with order book and you can stake kujira but apy is paid by fees of all their protocols ( non emmision)


[09/02/2022 2:35 PM] jhon_moio#2140
And all these with bridges across various ecosystem haha


[09/02/2022 2:35 PM] jhon_moio#2140
I think you can take good ideas from them


[09/02/2022 2:38 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Right, well for duckpools this continous apy can really be self-sustained (both fees or emitted tokens wouldn't really even be needed) since loans will eventually settle debts and Ergo smart contracts can reference active loans. All that would be needed is some bootstrap capital


[09/02/2022 2:39 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Yeah I am sure there are some fine ideas out there worth checking out. Just as I feel chains in the future will look to Ergo for good ideas üöÄ


[09/02/2022 2:40 PM] jhon_moio#2140
How much ergo can i put now? I think its in beta isnt it?


[09/02/2022 2:43 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
We have a 0.5ERG limit per tx at the moment, but I actually would recommend waiting for the next release, this current one is incomplete and its intention was to simply test out the lend/borrow/repay/withdraw cycle.


[09/02/2022 2:44 PM] jhon_moio#2140
Ok thanks

Hello,

This doesn't seem to exist anymore, it's empty. I just tried going via the Duckpools website to make sure I wasn't dreaming, but it's definitely empty. Is that correct? Or am I looking incorrectly? I was hoping to check out the liquidation comments, again.


[12/23/2022 4:32 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Hey, yeah we made it private when we were considering a bug bounty competition


[12/23/2022 4:32 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000

Comments regarding the threshold is described best probably in the collateral contract section.


[12/23/2022 4:47 AM] DeanP#0000
Awesome, thanks for this. I was only reading the documentation a few weeks back, and I just wanted to refer back to it. 

I'll keep my eye on things as best I can. I believe you're looking at the possibility of a token, and I liked your previous comments on this matter. I look forward to seeing more details of your plan for the project.


[12/24/2022 1:46 AM] yeahokai#0000
After lending ergo to pool is it meant to show up on the 'your assets in pool'?


[12/24/2022 1:47 AM] yeahokai#0000

Id like to see some liquidations during the beta which hasnt happened yet!


[01/10/2023 11:38 AM] DeanP#0000
Damn, I had a higher risk loan I paid back yesterday. I'll put one back on. I don't mind taking one for the team üòâ

By the way, the Twitter Space the team were involved with on Sunday with Cardano Proxies was really insightful. It was nice to hear about the plans for the future. Keep up the great work.


[01/10/2023 7:42 PM] Foeniculum ERGnomes#0000
Love to hear that! We're considering having a more in-depth space about lending with Duckpools and e.g. Aada Finance from Cardano üòÅ


[01/11/2023 6:08 AM] DeanP#0000
That would be awesome. Something being a little more centered around Duckpools would be very useful. I'm not saying don't try and include Aada Finance, I absolutely would love to hear that. I just think something a little more personally would be great. May be dropping some targets Q1 or Q2 (whenever it may be) for a token sale on Ergopad would help as well. Some may want to make sure they organise their Ergo and Ergopad accordingly üòâ 

I'll keep my eyes peeled for the Whitepaper.


[01/11/2023 6:13 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
I'd love us to release a date for the token sale, nothing official yet but I would count on it coming very soon. üôÇ
Having Aada Finance join us would be great, but totally agree something more personal is needed too. 
I do plan on hosting a couple AMAs leading up to the token sale so that will be a good opportunity for that. 

Whitepaper is just about ready, but we are waiting on some legal advice before we can release.


[01/11/2023 12:41 PM] Foeniculum ERGnomes#0000
Having a Cardano counterpart helps with showing them what Ergo and its devs are capable of, as well as with reaching out to Cardano peeps that don't know much about Ergo DeFi ü•≥


[01/11/2023 5:35 PM] MGpai#0000
@Krasavice Blasen Have you considered using NFTs as collateral?


[01/11/2023 11:39 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Yes, but perhaps better as a sky harbor product. On duckpools it would be fine too so long as nft offers are setup so nfts could actually be immediately liquidated


[01/17/2023 7:53 PM] Noah#0000
this will be possible on SigmaFi


[01/17/2023 7:54 PM] Noah#0000
any native token including stake keys could be used as collateral


[01/17/2023 9:32 PM] quokka#0000

[01/22/2023 10:01 PM] DeanP#0000
I was curious to know if you have you now seen this happen? 

I had some positions in place, but they seem to have disappeared. The problem I've got is I haven't tallied everything up as good as I had hoped for you, and the Ergo explorer is defeating me at the moment haha. 

This had me thinking will their be something showing the transactions an individual has made? This would make things much easier.


[01/22/2023 10:05 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Yeah we plan to have a full user dashboard which shows all sorts of things, one of which is tx history


[01/22/2023 10:10 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Oh wow! I actually hadn't looked through the history when I made this statement, I thought there were no liquidations since my position hadn't been liquidated (and I bought at an extreme) but it seems like many have been already!


[01/22/2023 10:11 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Here is an example of a liquidation transaction: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/1bf959cf7dd2b51155ba4f3ae358530331f36c2dcc0a05d49e4716dfa10c3063
So if you are looking for your own, follow the path of your txs to where it ends up at ``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`` (this is the collateral contract) and then you should find it being spent


[01/22/2023 10:18 PM] DeanP#0000
I'm sure someone would have already mentioned this, but because I noticed my positions looked liquidated I thought I would mention something. 

What you've mentioned sounds like just the thing needed.


[01/22/2023 10:26 PM] DeanP#0000
Nice. I shouldn't be happy to see my positions liquidated, but I'm glad they've helped the team haha. It goes to show that positions particularly with all the volatility going on need to be monitored. Obviously, I'm only playing with small figures to help. 

Thanks for sending me an example of a liquidated position. I'll have a play with things, and I'll try and locate mine.

I discovered Duckpools yesterday via a newsletter. 
I would like to offer for **free** an interview on my blog. 

Please have a look at some of my previous interviews. 
https://thesurferinvestor.com/analysis/interview-0xsilkroad-teaparty/
https://thesurferinvestor.com/analysis/interview-supriyo-hyy-pe/

I do it to support early stage founders. 
I would send you some question in writing, you answer them via voice message or writing (you decide) - then I work on making a bullish article and you have final approval. Then I publish. 
It should take around 30mins of your time.

what's up


[01/31/2023 11:14 PM] Austen Milbarge | mikeyctc1#6303
Hello, i have a Question about Lending on DuckPools, say I wanted to commit 1000 Erg to the Pool right now, and there's only 331 ERG currently in the pool, so that makes 1331 total ERG available for Borrowing, if someone Borrows 500 Erg, am I locked into holding My entire 1000 in until they repay, or could I pull out 831, and have to hold 169 in until the ERG Deposited for Lending goes above 669 to pull my other 169 out?


[02/01/2023 12:03 AM] Foeniculum#0000
Hi!
Fyi you can only lend 1 ERG atm cause Duckpools is still in beta

(you've just posted the same message 3 times in case you didn't notice)


[02/01/2023 12:22 AM] Austen Milbarge | mikeyctc1#6303
oh, Unsure why it posted 3 times.. , yes I understand current situation,  Im just asking for Reference in the future hown it works


[02/01/2023 1:30 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
In your hypothetical situation you could pull out as much as availble, you dont need to wait for the full 1000. But, it is unrealistic for one person to make up so much of a major pool, so without 1 Erg limits this would be close to impossible for the Erg pool


[02/01/2023 1:32 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Maybe if a community created novelty token with low traction was made, one person might make up the majority of the pool and have to deal with this. But again, if this is an issue then we can just create locked liquidity contracts too


[02/01/2023 2:38 AM] Austen Milbarge | mikeyctc1#6303
I see, so pools will have limits so this doesn‚Äôt happen. Just trying to learn how I could commit enough to make the APY return a couple Erg a day. And what type commitment that amount of erg has to be to the pool.


[02/01/2023 2:39 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
No no, pools won't have limits!


[02/01/2023 2:39 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
They just do for now with testing stage


[02/01/2023 2:40 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
I was just saying once the limits are gone, the ERG pool is likely to have significantly more liquidity so it will be very difficult for one person to make up even 20% of the pooled funds


[02/01/2023 2:42 AM] gcarrharris#0000
Was curious on the wallet snapshot for the QUACK how much do you have to be staking on ergopad


[02/01/2023 2:42 AM] gcarrharris#0000
Couldn‚Äôt see that


[02/01/2023 2:42 AM] gcarrharris#0000
To be eligible for sale


[02/01/2023 2:49 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
From my understanding of the info at https://www.ergopad.io/staking
it looks like you need at least 12,500 Ergopad staked. Let me confirm with marty


[02/01/2023 2:51 AM] Austen Milbarge | mikeyctc1#6303
Oh I got ya. Thank you for taking the time to explain


[02/01/2023 2:52 AM] gcarrharris#0000
Ok thanks so that looks like minimum tier if I remember without looking, so if you are minimum tier on the snapshot you should be eligible


[02/01/2023 2:53 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Yeah that sounds correct to me. I'll let you know if otherwise as soon as I can üôÇ


[02/01/2023 10:35 AM] WickedRider17#0000
Hi Blasen, with regard to this ergopad stake. Let‚Äôs say the stakers registering for the whitelist have a total of stake of 10mil ergopad and my stake represent, say, 0.1mil ergopad (i.e 1%). Does that mean I can only purchase 1% of 3.15mil Quacks = 31,500 tokens?


[02/01/2023 11:04 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
So my understanding is that the maximum amount of tokens allocated to you would be: (your tier allocation / total allocation weigh registered) * 3.15 mil tokens. This roughly equates to what are stating. 0.1 mil has a allocation weight of 96. So you would get 96/ amount registered * 3.15 million


[02/01/2023 11:06 AM] WickedRider17#0000
I see


[02/01/2023 11:07 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
The nature of our token launch is to raise the  amount of funds actually needed, not some speculative figure. The consequence of this is the supply can be quite limited. But I do hope that this increases token ownership decentralization


[02/01/2023 11:07 AM] WickedRider17#0000
1. Is there a table for the tier allocation?
2. What if someone does not buy up all the token allocated for them?


[02/01/2023 11:08 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
In the page linked if you click tiers it explains the allocations


[02/01/2023 11:08 AM] WickedRider17#0000
Totally agree on the token ownership decentralisation üíØ


[02/01/2023 11:10 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
2. I have asked Marty to confirm exactly how we proceed with unsold tokens. Unsold tokens will definitely be resold, it most likely will be a first come first served so there wont be allocation shenanigans there.


[02/01/2023 11:10 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
But yeah hopefully he can back soon so I can give a how and when for that one


[02/01/2023 11:10 AM] WickedRider17#0000
Thanks a lot. Found it!

[02/01/2023 11:11 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Yep keep in mind the tiers stack which is why 100k should have 96 weight


[02/01/2023 11:22 AM] FlyingPig#0000
100k would have 58 as weighting as the Gamma tier.
If you have 125k you get the 100k weight for Gamme which is 58 and the 25k weight for Alpha which is 10, totalling 68.


[02/01/2023 11:46 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Ahhh ok, I misunderstood that makes sense! Thanks for clarifying


[02/01/2023 11:47 AM] WickedRider17#0000
I see. Yeah that makes more sense üò¨


[02/01/2023 3:23 PM] gcarrharris#0000
Hey GM all


[02/01/2023 3:23 PM] gcarrharris#0000
Is it safe to say if you are staking on at least minimum tier, you can get some $quacks


[02/01/2023 3:24 PM] gcarrharris#0000
Or is it not guaranteed


[02/01/2023 3:29 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Yeah it should be guaranteed you receive the whitelist tokens which you can use to purchase your allocated $quacks


[02/01/2023 3:29 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
You can purchase anytime during the staker contribution phase


[02/01/2023 3:30 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
You can purchase anytime during the staker contribution phase, it is not first come first served for staker round


[02/01/2023 4:15 PM] gcarrharris#0000
Ok thanks and if your not staking ergo pad you can‚Äôt participate in the snapshot first round is that correct?


[02/02/2023 2:07 AM] yeahokai#0000
When is contribution phase?


[02/02/2023 2:08 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Yeah you will need to wait for the public round


[02/02/2023 2:10 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Staker contribution is Feb 4 at 18:00 UTC


[02/02/2023 2:52 PM] muffinator#5168
what are your thoughts/the main differences between sigmafi and duckpools on the surface they are very similar?


[02/02/2023 2:55 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
This exact question was asked on twitter today! https://twitter.com/duckpools_io/status/1621109011268636672?s=20&t=puVV11XJkX1m5oi5kz5NOA

@ndogg11421204 SigmaFi is p2p lending. So every request for a loan needs a lender who is willing to accept those specific conditions. duckpools is pooled lending. So lenders just drop assets in a pool, borrowers just borrow from the pool - all instantly! No need to wait for individual backers
Twitter


[02/02/2023 2:59 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
As mentioned it really boils down to p2p lending vs pool to peer lending. duckpools enables more reliable liquidity sources, you can say with great confidence that if you come to duckpools you could get a loan for just about any amount instantly. On sigmafi you would need to wait for a lender to match your specific conditions


[02/02/2023 2:59 PM] muffinator#5168
that was handy, Thank you!


[02/02/2023 3:03 PM] muffinator#5168
not sure this would be possible but what if someone made a token or artificially inflated a tokens value and then took out a large loan using the inflated value of the other token as collateral from the pool what would happen? and would that be possible?


[02/02/2023 3:05 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
So is the suggestion to use a token with artifically inflated value as collateral?


[02/02/2023 3:06 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
If so, then keep in mind pools have a select set of accepted collateral. So a brand new token couldn't just be easily accepted as collateral for a pool


[02/02/2023 3:06 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Pools can add collateral types over time, but they would need to go through governance and there would be a large window of warning so lenders who disagree with it can withdraw positions if needed


[02/02/2023 3:07 PM] muffinator#5168
Thank you for the quick reply and great answer


[02/02/2023 3:08 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
No worries, also to add, pools can set different liquidation thresholds for every asset accepted as collateral. So perhaps $sigusd might be considered a safe collateral it could have low liquidation threshold, but some risky token like $comet for example should have a higher threshold


[02/02/2023 3:09 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
The pools themselves are designed to be quite customizable actually üôÇ


[02/02/2023 4:23 PM] StarboyNeon#0000
Why are people having bot tag


[02/02/2023 4:24 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
There is a #duckpools channel in the main Ergo discord and messages there are being bridged here by a bot


[02/02/2023 4:26 PM] StarboyNeon#0000
ooh


[02/03/2023 10:11 AM] Xizzle4Shizzle#0000
Will we be able to earn QUACKS just by using the platform e.g lending and borrowing?


[02/03/2023 10:16 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Its possible as the holders can vote to set this up using treasury tokens and its in the spirit of decentralized ownership and rewarding those with regular use of the platform


[02/03/2023 10:18 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
But no explicit definition of this has beeb planned yet, coming up with fair reward systems free from exploits takes some time to plan and research


[02/03/2023 10:18 AM] Xizzle4Shizzle#0000
Oh that's strange I thought it would've just been a given considering most defi you get rewarded by using the platform


[02/03/2023 10:19 AM] Xizzle4Shizzle#0000
Yeah that makes sense


[02/03/2023 10:20 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
But no explicit definition of this has been planned yet, coming up with fair reward systems free from exploits takes some time to plan and research


[02/03/2023 10:48 AM] George208H#0000
Has duckpools launched? I only see 300+ ERG locked?


[02/03/2023 10:57 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Launched as a proof of concept beta. The beta has transaction limits of 1 ERG, hence the low liquidity. We had this in place to protect users during testing phase. Full launch will have no limits after some additional security checks and audits, as well as some UI redesign and more borrowing features and lending pools üôÇ


[02/03/2023 10:58 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
But keep in mind the beta is fully functional from lending to borrowing, dynamic interest rates and liquidations. But full launch will be even better!


[02/03/2023 11:36 AM] XupEdd#0000
Any future plans to collaborate with Spectrum DEX?


[02/03/2023 12:31 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Definitely! We already use Spectrum DEX for liquidations on insufficiently collateralized loans. In phase 3 of our token launch a candidate feature to be developed is undercollateralized loans in restricted spending environments - one example of a restricted spending environment might be on spectrum, so margin trading tools for spectrum up to 100x leverage for example


[02/03/2023 12:32 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Similar to a margin trading account on a CEX, duckpools could be used for this on spectrum DEX


[02/03/2023 3:39 PM] Kikubaaqudgha#0000
Hasn't been here for a while, did the initial airdrop happened?


[02/03/2023 3:42 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
The airdrop rewards are still safely being held. We were just waiting for beta closure which got delayed a bit as we prioritized token launch in order to grow faster


[02/03/2023 3:42 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
But, that said I think we should announce an end date for it. Get a last minute flurry of testing as the public token launch round comes into play!


[02/03/2023 3:43 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Expect an annoucement in the next 2 days, thanks for bringing it up!


[02/03/2023 3:51 PM] Kikubaaqudgha#0000

[02/03/2023 3:51 PM] gcarrharris#0000
Hey all Gm


[02/03/2023 3:51 PM] Kikubaaqudgha#0000
looking forward to the full launch


[02/03/2023 3:53 PM] gcarrharris#0000
Spent some time reading the white paper and I love the project, however the last page of WP I am curious about the anonymous entity‚Ä¶do investors get access to the multi sig info and all that? I was super comfy and about to stake ergopad but after that last page it makes me a bit cautious, anywhere to read more about the entity and will the community be involved in anyway managing the treasury?


[02/03/2023 4:03 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
So the disclaimer is there for legal reasons to recognize that, as with most tokens, just because a project makes claims about its token's offerings they usually don't carry any legal weight. Generally, people purchase tokens in good faith, which is the sad reality of the lack of good regulation for crypto in the world right now. 

Some of the legal advice we received recommended using a different entity to run the token sale, so we as founders, wouldn't be liable for any possible damages. We have gone down this route. 

All I can really say is that I vouch for and trust this entity 100%. I believe that they will act responsibly. As mentioned in the whitepaper, financial statements will be prepared for token holders, which will show exactly how funds have been spent.


[02/03/2023 4:05 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Also, keep in mind phase 2 looks to create even greater funding levels than phase 1, so I would argue that the greatest incentive is to deliver on the proposed works


[02/03/2023 4:09 PM] gcarrharris#0000
where is the entity of the anonymous jurisdiction?


[02/03/2023 4:09 PM] gcarrharris#0000
location wise


[02/03/2023 4:09 PM] gcarrharris#0000
and thx for the explanation


[02/03/2023 4:12 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
A jurisdiction with more relaxed regulations on crypto token sales üôÇ 
I can't be more specific than that sorry!


[02/03/2023 4:13 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
No worries, I am glad you are doing your research. duckpools afterall is about sound finance. I really hate how dubious things need to be!


[02/03/2023 4:18 PM] gcarrharris#0000
I understand regulations are hard trust me I‚Äôm also building a project, just hard to get serious investors to put money in an ‚Äúanonymous entity‚Äù and also not disclose where they are located


[02/03/2023 4:18 PM] gcarrharris#0000
I‚Äôm sure you have heard of INDIGO on cardano but an example of posting public all the legal docs they have, the cayman island jurisdiction and paperwork, etc.


[02/03/2023 4:19 PM] gcarrharris#0000
They have been building for over a year and are blowing up now, it‚Äôs synthetics so a bit different but just as a regulatory example


[02/03/2023 4:20 PM] gcarrharris#0000
As I remain in cardano and venture into ergo, I‚Äôm looking for great projects like this, but this above would hold me back personally from investing a large amount, that‚Äôs just me doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs right or anything


[02/03/2023 4:29 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
For sure, I do agree that serious investors would beware or at least not invest with large amounts and this is perfectly reasonable to me. 

Fortunately, phase 1 has a very minimal target funding. Even small contributions from the many will likely allow us to reach funding goals. 

Thereafter, code becomes law. Phase 1 transitions the protocol in its entirety to a DAO-like structure at smart contract level. Subsequent token sale tokens are locked by smart contracts unless follow-on phases are successful. Promises become reality in code and subsequent funding rounds require less and less trust in the token sale conductor.


[02/03/2023 4:31 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Really, the legal structures become less and less useful. And the protocol and token sale become rather isolated from legalties


[02/03/2023 4:32 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
That said, it's possible some of those filings INDIGO has could become public information. I would need to consult with some legal advice first though!

Ergopad team are very active on telegram, I'd suggest you ask them on there


[02/03/2023 7:28 PM] bitsolver#0000
yeah, I've just posted on their discord, and so did someone else who was just trying to signup but I guess their form submission failed as "soldout" ... and, no offense, but IMHO telegram is hot garbage and it can fucking die ... its UI/UX is so god-awful I don't know how it ever gained any traction at all


[02/03/2023 7:30 PM] Foeniculum#0000
haha fair enough, I personally find it useful when asking for help to DeFi protocols like DEXes etc

Hi,  Is there a bug with the  borrowing tab?  I posted 31 SigRSV of collateral to receive 1 ERG and signed my transaction.  THe 31 SigRSV are gone but I did not receive the 1 ERG and the borrowing key.

NEVERIND- The trade got reversed and my SigRSV is back in my account.  I guess that side of the dApp is not ready yet to be tested.

Basically there is indeed a bug with an API call so your order was automatically refunded

@Planotesta Borrowing has been functional on the beta, there is a bug retrieving some data from an API right now. So your borrow order was automatically refunded after it did not go through due to the bug! We will post update in discord when fixed (should be soon)

[02/04/2023 1:00 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Haha secretly I share your telegram sentiment. Looks like ErgoPad messed up with their dates on their tweet. As you can see they extended it and now there are 2 hours left


[02/04/2023 1:01 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Fortunately, it wont delay any other part of the token launch


[02/04/2023 1:20 AM] planou#0000
Thanks


[02/04/2023 2:18 AM] Marty#0000
Sorry about all the issues everyone. Just a reminder the staker snapshot is in 45 minutes


[02/04/2023 2:18 AM] Marty#0000
The signup form will be live until then as well


[02/04/2023 11:46 PM] cyrusk40#0000
Any whitelist leftovers someone has for quackpools staker round contribution?


[02/04/2023 11:46 PM] cyrusk40#0000
Missed that one


[02/05/2023 12:50 AM] mattam#0000
Beta was only 1900 Quacks ü•≤


[02/05/2023 12:52 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Fortunately there is still public round and beta staking gets 1 hour early access on signup


[02/05/2023 12:55 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
As mentioned there has been so much demand that supply is really stretched!


[02/05/2023 1:43 AM] planou#0000
My stake key was on a different address than the one I whitelisted ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Will need to wait for public round


[02/05/2023 1:44 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
I am afraid so, sorry! We can't change allocations post signup as it would adjust everyones allocations

Is there anything that explains the staking details and benefit? Have any tokens listed on ergopad appreciated since launch? Thx


[02/05/2023 3:28 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
There is no staking for duckpools token. 

I am not sure about the details regarding if other tokens have depreciated after their launch. 

I think though, in general most have declined in value. But I think with duckpools since we have a modest funding target (low supply) and there is no staking (no supply to be added) and seemingly high demand. I, personally, believe appreciation is rather likely - but this of course is not financial advice and just my opinion üôÇ

[02/05/2023 3:31 PM] cannon#0000
Mention staking here... in ergopad, yes? It is all confusing a bit honestly and I'm a finance guy. But I haven't focused a ton of time on the raises for any tokens. Was curious on this one.


[02/05/2023 3:32 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
The round is called the staker round since you need to stake Ergopad to qualify for allocations in that round. But thereafter, no staking exists at all for $QUACKS


[02/05/2023 3:33 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
I think a lot of projects do use staking which is why that word is so visible on the sit

[02/05/2023 3:33 PM] cannon#0000
Stake ergopad, then it converts to quacks?


[02/05/2023 3:33 PM] cannon#0000
Pledge of an asset effectively?


[02/05/2023 3:36 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
No, so our token launch phase 1 has to subrounds:
1. Staker Round
2. Public Round

In the staker round you can signup to purchase $QUACKS at a reduced price but with a longer vesting period. To signup you need to stake ErgoPad tokens. When you signup you are allocated a portion of the staker round offering. You can chose to buy those $QUACKS in Ergs/sigUsd.

In the public round you don't need to stake ErgoPad at all. Anyone can signup when signups open to buy in the public round


[02/05/2023 3:37 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
No, so our token launch phase 1 has 2 subrounds:
1. Staker Round
2. Public Round

In the public round you don't need to stake ErgoPad at all. Anyone can signup when signups open to buy in the public round


[02/05/2023 3:39 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Basically anyone ALWAYS has to purchase the $QUACKS. Staking ErgoPad just allowed purchase of the tokens for a reduced price over a longer vesting period.


[02/05/2023 3:40 PM] cannon#0000
Do you get the ergopad tokens back after the round/snapshot is completed?


[02/05/2023 3:41 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Yeah so you can unstake at anytime but unstaking fees apply as follows depending on when you unstake:

[02/05/2023 3:46 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
If you are interested in the staker round just know it has already been completed.

For some perspective though, the staker round allocation makes up just 9% of the tokens planned to be publicly sold so the amount offered to each person was quite limited due to minimal supply on offer.


[02/05/2023 3:54 PM] cannon#0000
No worries... just trying to understand it all without investing a ton of time. Probably not the best way, but time is limited


[02/05/2023 3:55 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Yeah I fully understand. Theres a lot of info out there, so even if you have just a small question I am happy to answer anything üôÇ


[02/05/2023 3:57 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Its good to build an understanding of how it all works even if you are just participating in the public round


[02/05/2023 4:03 PM] cannon#0000
Is there any document/presentation that lays it out... nothing I've found thus far does and that is ...


[02/05/2023 4:16 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
The whitepaper covers just about everything at a general/overview level in the tokenomics.


[02/05/2023 4:18 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Maybe some outside context is needed (i.e. what exactly is an ergopad staker) but I feel most of the key parts (token distribution, token sale prices, vesting periods) is all described in the whitepaper


[02/05/2023 4:21 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
I feel something that really walks you through it would be nice to have, but at this stage the whitepaper is the best resource available


[02/05/2023 5:08 PM] StarboyNeon#0000
Thanks


[02/05/2023 7:50 PM] HelixEvo#0000
Is everyone getting less tokens than what they put down in the whitelist?


[02/05/2023 7:51 PM] HelixEvo#0000
I have only received ~790 whitelist tokens.


[02/05/2023 9:13 PM] Foeniculum#0000
I think for issues like these it'd be easier to reach out to Ergopad directly

The duckpools telegram group has flown under the radar and I think it needs some love! 

I will be giving away 4 vesting keys of 2,000 $QUACKS (valued as +$50 USD at IDO) to a random choice of 4 of the first 200 people to join the telegram üëá

Lending ADA(or wrapped tokens) using bridge is in the plan?


[02/09/2023 5:53 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Lending any ergo native asset is in the plan and will actually be supported in just phase 1 of the development works


[02/09/2023 5:53 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Lending any ergo native asset (including any bridged assets) is in the plan and will actually be supported in just phase 1 of the development works


[02/09/2023 5:55 AM] XupEdd#0000
Ok, but it's going to support multi-chain in the future? Can I suggest that?


[02/09/2023 5:59 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Certainly, it could be something to look into for phase 3 or treasury funded works. But it would most likely be best to partner with a bridge service (since the bridge project would have done the research for us already) to facilitate direct cross-chain lending and borrowing


[02/09/2023 6:00 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
So all in all, wrapped ada will be lendable and borrowable in the very near future, whereas using native ada or other cross-chain assets would be reserved until at least phase 3


[02/09/2023 6:00 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000

Also to add to this. When you go to signup it will ask you to select a wallet. To paste in your address, click mobile and then it will let you put an paste an address there

The platform will be in beta until token sale is complete to use funds raised to perform security audits and allow for adjustable pool parameters

[02/19/2023 8:57 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Its the same round, whitelist tokens were allocated first come first served to those who signed up earliest (roughly those on the 9th/10th when signups first opened) and remaining signups were placed on waitlist.


[02/19/2023 9:01 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
All in all 3.15m Public tokens are being sold, early signups have had a reserved period of time to make their contribution and waitlist will be able to purchase any remaining quacks at first come first served when it opens up Feb 20, 0001 UTC.


[02/19/2023 9:02 AM] legitimate#0000
So those who manage to buy on Feb 20 will get it at the same $0.0019 per with 6 month lock?

One too many zeros I think

[02/22/2023 10:26 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
They will be burnt

[02/22/2023 10:27 AM] NuTt#0000
i thought it will go for fund reserve


[02/22/2023 10:27 AM] NuTt#0000
we got sold all 3.5M on staker round right?


[02/22/2023 10:28 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Staker sold out, just about a million left on public.


[02/22/2023 10:28 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
As mentioned in whitepaper tokens are burnt which will effectively increase everyones relative ownership to supply


[02/22/2023 10:29 AM] NuTt#0000
it‚Äôs nice to hear that


[02/22/2023 10:30 AM] NuTt#0000
hopefully everything will be sold out in public sale too


[02/22/2023 10:30 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Indeed!


[02/23/2023 7:42 PM] Bublik#0000
Sorry if this has been asked already, but is there any estimated date for when the beta ends and more deposits into duckpools will be available?


[02/23/2023 11:49 PM] NuTt#0000
if anyone has extra tokens please send 10000 whitelist tokens for my friend wallet address 

thank you for advance

[02/24/2023 4:20 AM] arkadias#0000
How did public round go?


[02/24/2023 10:38 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
73% sold out!


[02/24/2023 10:38 AM] arkadias#0000
That's great to hear!


[02/24/2023 10:57 AM] DeanP#0000
A sold out staker round, and 73% sold out in the public round is amazing. I know a number of projects in the crypto world have struggled to do well on their token sales in recent times. This is very nice to see.


[02/24/2023 12:02 PM] jozinek#0000
anyone still having unused whitelist tokens?


[02/24/2023 6:04 PM] bitsolver#0000

now i have zero ergs, 
only ducks ü¶Üüòú

need to wait for next paycheck to buy erg again üòÖ


[02/24/2023 6:38 PM] NuTt#0000
i never seen this type of lending model before on cardano, sol, eth


[02/24/2023 6:38 PM] NuTt#0000
it‚Äôs easy to understand people 
what is meaning of decentralized


[02/24/2023 6:38 PM] quokka#0000
haha understandable, lots to read through


[02/24/2023 6:39 PM] quokka#0000
Yeah. AVAX has it but there is much more possibility on Ergo eUTXO


[02/24/2023 6:40 PM] quokka#0000
We also didn't ask for a million dollars like a lot of tokens do, so our price evaluation is much more reasonable


[02/24/2023 6:41 PM] NuTt#0000
never looked on inside after Luna, i thought next Avax ü§™


[02/24/2023 6:42 PM] NuTt#0000
simply was on cardano but felt ergo is the thing what i was expecting from cardano


[02/24/2023 6:42 PM] NuTt#0000
here there are more tools to build


[02/24/2023 6:43 PM] NuTt#0000
hope in future many devs find the way


[02/24/2023 6:43 PM] quokka#0000
Same thing happened to me when I first got here. Was excited for Cardano smart contracts and when I saw what they were like I pivoted 100% towards Ergo. I think it was the right decision


[02/24/2023 6:44 PM] quokka#0000
And now the community seems to be imploding lol. I think it's temporary and they will get sentiment back, but I enjoy that there is no huge drama like that here currently


[02/25/2023 5:06 PM] planou#0000
Hi
Is the borrow feature not working?
I wanted to test it last night but got my SigRSV refunded.
If it‚Äôs not working, could the button be disabled? Or some pop-up telling us not to go through with signing the transaction.


[02/26/2023 12:05 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
The intention is for it to be working but it currently is not due to an api issue that we need fixed. Been a little caught up with the ido but now that its over should have a chance to fix in the coming days


[02/26/2023 12:27 AM] planou#0000
Great thanks


[02/26/2023 8:13 PM] slkev7#0000
Sorry if this has already been answered, when does the vesting period start for the public sale and other rounds?


[02/27/2023 3:50 AM] cafebedouin#9837
It had its IDO already. So, it is over.


[02/27/2023 3:51 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Oh, vesting can be redeemed at Ergopad.io


[02/27/2023 3:51 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Dashboard.


[02/27/2023 3:51 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Already begun.


[02/28/2023 2:34 PM] Jpow#2124
was lurking n trying things, are we not supposed to be able to redeem liquidity atm?


[03/01/2023 10:54 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Yeah you can redeem your tokens on the Ergopad dashboard!


[03/01/2023 2:10 PM] Jpow#2124
i don't mean tokens i mean erg in liquidity pool


[03/01/2023 2:11 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Ah on duckpools.io? Yeah you should be able to withdraw lent ergs just fine


[03/01/2023 2:12 PM] Jpow#2124
In this case seems like there's something wrong. Deposited 1erg 2 days ago, tx is confirmed, and nothing happened aside from that. withdrawal still greyed out. Dont have a token to redeem or anything like that in my wallet.

[03/01/2023 2:16 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Ahh this timeline aligns with something that occurred recently on another project. Seems like a node issue on an off-chain bot


[03/01/2023 2:17 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
I will reset up our off-chain bot and your tx will be refunded. After that you are welcome to try adding liqudity again

Sounds good


[03/01/2023 2:36 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Ah the problem was we decided to take down an off-chain bot to reduce costs until full launch. But the back-up bot had outdated code


[03/01/2023 2:36 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Refunds should have hit wallets now


[03/01/2023 2:40 PM] Jpow#2124
Yeap, it did.


[03/01/2023 2:42 PM] Jpow#2124

is ergo-lend(exle) a rug ?


[03/01/2023 4:35 PM] NuTt#0000
for now, Sigma fi is P2P and ducks is p2pool right


[03/01/2023 5:09 PM] quirk220#0000
exle is non collateralized lending protocol for unbanked countries.  It has an excellent team and is almost in beta.


[03/01/2023 5:25 PM] NuTt#0000
i felt it‚Äôs a rug üòÖ because no updates


[03/01/2023 5:26 PM] NuTt#0000
you mean it‚Äôs only works in certain countries?


[03/01/2023 5:27 PM] NuTt#0000
i am trying to explore ergo ecosystem more but it‚Äôs bit tougher üòâ actually


[03/01/2023 5:27 PM] NuTt#0000
hopefully we get more tools üõ†Ô∏è sooner/later


[03/01/2023 6:05 PM] quirk220#0000
It will work anywhere but the target audience for the launch are those who are unbanked.


[03/02/2023 5:08 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Thanks for sharing, a few more issues to resolve regarding the change in off-chain bots. Minor fixes but currently I am somewhat occupied with other work. I will make an announcement when it has been fixed and tested


[03/03/2023 8:26 PM] NuTt#0000
is it possible to get know quacks token id ?

why i am not able check easily on ergo, like on cardanoscan ?


[03/03/2023 8:27 PM] NuTt#0000
totally supply ?
something like that way

https://www.ergopad.io/projects/duckpools


[03/03/2023 11:16 PM] quokka#0000
As for token ID, that‚Äôs a good point we should put that somewhere more obvious


[03/04/2023 9:01 PM] k1ngjohniii#2980
I know this is a dumb question but what am I doing with my duckpoola public whitelist token on ergopad? I can't seem to figure out what to do with it now ..any help would be appreciated


[03/05/2023 10:03 AM] Roger Dodger#2680
Ser EXLE is a legit project and there are updates. You can join the telegram and communicate with the founder (Chris Ray) directly. @Chris Ray , it‚Äôs one of the more exciting programs in the space and they are actually bringing an important use case to an underserved part of the world. You can even see their first loans.


[03/05/2023 1:12 PM] planou#0000
GM, how is the development going? When will we be able to borrow? I tried a few times and get refunded my collateral.

Also, when do you expect to be ready to go 'live‚Äô with more than 1 erg? 

This platform is very similar to Liqwid on Cardano or Aave on Eth and has the potential to be very powerful. 

Exciting times ahead‚Ä¶


[03/05/2023 2:58 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Borrowing should be working since yesterday, feel free to give it a go again!

As for going live we need to implement adjustable protocol design so that parameters can be changed without "hard fork" and do security audits. For specific time, I think a realistic assessment of this is May, but more optimistically April.


[03/05/2023 6:17 PM] planou#0000
Thanks for the update. Just sent a borrow trade. I will check if it remains or if Inget reimbursed


[03/05/2023 7:28 PM] planou#0000

[03/12/2023 9:53 PM] planou#0000
When should we expect a go-live? Will api be similar to current beta version or will it adjust based on lend/borrowing ratio like in Aave, Liqwid and other similar tools?


[03/15/2023 12:12 AM] planou#0000
Is there another community where people exchange about this project, like Telegram or is this a dead duck?


[03/15/2023 12:23 AM] cannon#3541
Think @Krasavice Blasen said was focusing on other work in short term... back on Mar 2nd

[03/15/2023 2:04 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Regardless, I do expect it to be fairly quiet until closer to full launch. Preparations for full launch have been going on in the background (engaging contractors, final processing of the ido)


[03/15/2023 2:05 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000

[03/15/2023 11:21 AM] cannon#3541
I see a lot of activity in general on ergo but not a lot of marketing or hype for most projects. Not commenting on if that's a good thing, just an observation over part half year or so

There‚Äôs a small limit like 1 ergo you can use to test


[03/23/2023 11:09 PM] gcarrharris#0000
As far as I knew the protocol was not live


[03/27/2023 12:16 PM] wombo22#0000
tvl displayed on website, live with limits if im not mistaken

but my wallet is short an ergo


[03/28/2023 2:10 AM] Setvin#0000
does it take more than 10 confirmations?


[03/28/2023 2:14 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
No it should take only a couple, I will check this out soon for you


[03/28/2023 2:16 AM] Setvin#0000

[03/29/2023 2:20 PM] Setvin#0000
I made a duck ergo nft


[03/31/2023 12:52 PM] Setvin#0000
oh wow you airdropped NETA?


[03/31/2023 12:52 PM] Setvin#0000
thank you!


[03/31/2023 1:00 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Yeah neta and a few other tokens I believe were part of it. It was small airdrop setup a while ago to encourage testing


[03/31/2023 1:01 PM] Setvin#0000
I have a lot of time on my hands lets just say that. I made a porcelain duck nft you want one lol. Have been trying to test the ecosystem


[03/31/2023 1:01 PM] Setvin#0000
are you also involved with skyharbor? I was hoping to get verified on that platform so I can think about making a collection.


[03/31/2023 1:02 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Yeah, Ive been working with quokka on setting up an automatic verification system so in the future new applications can instantly have a profile


[03/31/2023 1:03 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
But in the meantime, if you want to get verified apply very early as waiting times tend to be long without the automation


[03/31/2023 1:04 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Haha sure, Id love to see it. Ill send you an address to send to üôÇ


[03/31/2023 1:05 PM] Setvin#0000
yes I have submitted my app, so I will continue to exercise patience


[03/31/2023 1:07 PM] Setvin#0000
also I did have a question about the platform. Will you be able to show how much interest you accrued? I see right now says I just have "1 ergo" but maybe I have earned .0000145 interest lol


[03/31/2023 1:07 PM] Setvin#0000
you could show those decimal places slowly going up it make user want to use site more cuz monkey brain


[03/31/2023 1:11 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
If you hover over your erg it should show a precise amount


[03/31/2023 1:12 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
In the development scope we will have real time updates that should literally grow as you watch your screen

But yeah it would all be part of the lender dashboard in phase 2


[03/31/2023 1:13 PM] Setvin#0000
also would you be able to clarify in your announcement what will happen to tokens that are not withdrawn before the end of testing. Will they just return in liquidity if that is not done?


[03/31/2023 1:13 PM] Setvin#0000
happy to report, that should be quick fix


[03/31/2023 1:14 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
If they are not withdrawn there will be no UI to access them. If you are savy you could try and use a node and build the transaction manually to withdraw from the smart contracts.


[03/31/2023 1:15 PM] Setvin#0000
but when you return with phase two funds will still be there?


[03/31/2023 1:17 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
No, since it will be a complete "hard-fork" update. If people ask for it though we can have the old protocol running on a separate site/domain (like auction house v1) so people can still access old funds there


[03/31/2023 1:18 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
This should be at least for quite some time, the last update of this nature. So future updates will work as you mention where user funds carry over.


[03/31/2023 1:18 PM] Setvin#0000
ok I think it will be better if users remove funds now


[03/31/2023 1:19 PM] Setvin#0000
thanks for clarifying

Created this "Porcelain Duck" which is an NFT on the ERGO network. I am looking to distribute 200 of these! You can comment below or message me if you are interested, just promise not to drop it! 

Just give me your Ergo address and why you want one!

I still have a few left to give out! Would love to include you. 

If you want one please reply with your wallet address on reddit or preferably twitter. 

If you know anyone who might be interested dont be shy! 

The addresses I collect can and will be used for future airdrops as well.

[04/08/2023 12:51 PM] Setvin#0000
I need to hurry up and give away the rest of these porcelain ducks so I can work on my next project. 

I am thinkin all of those who are holders of the duck can be the base of the airdrop for my next project?

üì¢  Our beta will be closing April 17 to prepare for full launch.

It will be difficult to access funds held in the smart contracts after this closure date. Ensure you withdraw your funds prior.

üéâ  Part 1 of the beta tester airdrops have been released, so check your wallets!

[04/14/2023 1:08 AM] Setvin#0000
like 80% of the people who deposited did not withdraw their ergo, still like 300 in the beta lol


[04/14/2023 1:08 AM] Setvin#0000
Do you have a way to automatically send those funds back to their account holders?


[04/14/2023 7:37 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
No as that would require custody over their funds.


[04/14/2023 10:32 PM] Setvin#0000
maybe they can make an announcement in the main ergo discord? seems like many users will lose thier funds

[04/15/2023 2:36 AM] zuli#0000
Maybe he's intentionally trying to sabotage public image for newcomers. We should be wary of trolls.


[04/15/2023 2:36 AM] quokka#0000
I just dont think he knows discord too well. anyway he shouldve made me an admin


[04/15/2023 2:36 AM] quokka#0000

[04/15/2023 3:05 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
His messages are deleted? Are you saying to clear the spam too?

[04/15/2023 3:08 AM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
No he did not and no we are on differing. He should have ban, just never really setup the discord/look at settings since creating it


[04/15/2023 3:24 AM] Yanhui Zhu#0000

Hey mate, I'd like to recommend sharing the "beta closing" announcement in the tg group.


[04/15/2023 3:10 PM] quokka#0000
Sure


[04/15/2023 3:10 PM] quokka#0000

[04/15/2023 7:21 PM] NuTt#0000
any information about when we can see lending/borrowing for SigUSD/ERG/SigRSV


[04/15/2023 10:38 PM] theta_decay#0000
Sounds like they're getting close. Hopefully we'll get more details soon.


[04/16/2023 5:22 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
It was moved to the full launch package, so there will be numerous pools with no lend/borrow limits at full launch


[04/17/2023 12:16 AM] Khelben#0000
Ada?


[04/17/2023 1:42 PM] panasonic#0000
Guys, when's the full launch again?


[04/17/2023 1:43 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
There is no official date yet, but we are aiming for End of May


[04/17/2023 1:43 PM] Krasavice Blasen#0000
Yes we will offer wrapped Ada when the rosen bridge is ready


[04/20/2023 9:10 AM] F Kavka#0000
So duckpools is like AAVE on Ergo? When mainnet?


[04/20/2023 10:34 AM] bunnywabbit#0000
Basically yes, and It's already launched on main-net as beta version, which means lending and borrowing has been limited to 1 erg. Full release coming in +1 month
