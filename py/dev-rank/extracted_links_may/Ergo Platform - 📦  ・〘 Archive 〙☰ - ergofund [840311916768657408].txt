Hi there. I have some questions about funding. How does it work? Where can I pitch, etc? Thank you for taking the time to respond. All the best!


[05/12/2021 11:43 AM] glasgowm#9381
I take it you mean for funding from the Ergo Foundation? 

Please reference this article for scoping your own grant
https://www.dropbox.com/s/jnive23amb0f7od/Screenshot%202021-05-12%20at%2011.40.42.png?dl=0

and send it to ergoplatform@protonmail.com if you have a project that you believe is worth being funded Proposals, at the moment, need to be approved by four of six votes of Ergo Development Fund Board Members.

giveth looks like it uses virtual DOM. Guys, what framework to use, I have started flutter for mobile, but it isn't really mature for web. Currently I am learning React. What does the team think, what framework to use? As many people are now mobile, I think it's important to target those devices as well. So we need UI/UX design for mobile also.

I think we need SEO with ergofund. So I think next.js is a good pick as a framework?

What's that got to do with next.js?


[08/26/2021 8:05 AM] gnuion#3794
next.js offers SSR (Server Side Rendering) which is needed for SEO.


[08/26/2021 8:06 AM] glasgowm#9381
Sure, think you could do that with most implementations tho

I do not think there is anything special on the scanner! For ergoFund, @ezi0.audit0re  is working on it I do not know the final status, once the ergoFund structure is ready, we can proceed to the front in two parts (chain functionality / UI).

Hello! Who is willing to learn nextjs with me and work together on the frontend? Also, for the backend I tend to use nodejs just because I got into JavaScript and there is a greater community around it. But if the API endpoint work fine, we can build microservices on different containers and languages...


[10/03/2021 8:52 PM] ezi0.audit0re#1533
Hi. I am just working on the backend using Rust. Since @code_For_Uss and kushti had a discussion before about separating frontend and backend, I think we can go on with microservices.


[10/03/2021 8:53 PM] gnuion#3794
Awesome! Rust is a pretty solid and fast programming language!


[10/03/2021 8:54 PM] ezi0.audit0re#1533
However, It would be nice if you mention the usecases in the frontend so I can provide API endpoints for each.


[10/07/2021 1:10 AM] gnuion#3794
Hello Ezio, I might need to fetch data related to:
- Login (maybe it can also be a zero-knowledge proof, same as mina protocol wants to use for login. I find that idea interesting)
- For storing client data, we may want IPFS to keep the app decentral. So we need Endpoints for that to POST and GET data. But for the prototype, we might use a central server...
- Endpoints to fetch current projects (Project Name, Description, Percentage Completed, Goal) and be able to create new projects.

We might introduce later  a governance token to vote on platform changes like for example Uniswap did. I think this project has huge potential, but we need more developers. I am a newbie myself, but I think I can handle the UI, i.e. create the react components.


[10/07/2021 1:13 AM] gnuion#3794
Those tokens could also be used to monitor the content of the projects posted. So the community would be in charge and regulate harmful content.


[10/07/2021 1:36 PM] LADOPIXŒ£L#6072
I'm waiting for the API development to start working. I also don't have much experience in this kind of development but I think it can be very useful to review the code of ErgoRaffle, ErgoUtils, etc.

I think with endpoints similar to ErgoRaffle it is already possible to realize this website.

[10/07/2021 5:49 PM] ezi0.audit0re#1533
Cool! Thanks for your comments.
So I guess I will go with the endpoints for data fetching first, then others.


[10/07/2021 5:51 PM] ezi0.audit0re#1533
Also I believe there is no need to wait for the API to start working on the frontend. Using dummy data is one solution. However, the API will be ready soon. ü§ò

Hello guys! I will be creating the Next.js app following these practices. I am not currently using typescript. If you can, please share some resources on Next.js, what you think what guidelines should we stick to. I am also looking for ways to host the Next.js app. I tried Namecheap, but it turned out to be unstable. There is always the possibility to export the app to static HTML and hosted anywhere really without the need of a Node.js server.  Maybe I should try Heroku just for prototyping and testing the application. I am wondering though, is there a way of decentralized hosting?

I am hosting our frontend on vercel using nextjs - however because of the VM requirements for a typescript ENV - running the backend on lambdas is maybe not ideal.


[10/25/2021 7:29 PM] torchTheMall#9228
ergolend.org is next/vercel


[10/25/2021 7:29 PM] torchTheMall#9228
but we have to host our backend elsehwere - we went with scala.  I was looking into seeing if google cloud functions would work


[10/25/2021 7:29 PM] torchTheMall#9228
you can write scala functions


[10/25/2021 7:30 PM] torchTheMall#9228
the idea being that our react front end will just tunnel through vercel to whatever backend functions we create elsewhere


[10/25/2021 9:06 PM] gnuion#3794
That's awesome! Is it a good stategy to use microservices on docker containers to be more resource efficient?


[10/25/2021 9:09 PM] torchTheMall#9228
well im not sure really- I was looking into hosting and I would think if we could run scala and ergoscript on a google cloud function, perhaps we dont need a docker setup.

vercel doesnt really offer a docker setup its just typescript / node lambdas and you dont have many options

you can trigger functions quite a few ways, you can of course have an http gateway - or you can use pub/sub or even firebase database triggers


[10/25/2021 9:12 PM] torchTheMall#9228
again - not sure - as im not much of a scala dev - if this works with ergo appkit and everything


[10/25/2021 9:12 PM] torchTheMall#9228
but its something I wanted to explore - as that way if nobody is using it - youre not keeping a docker server running somewhere


[10/25/2021 9:12 PM] torchTheMall#9228

Hello guys! I already started designing React Components from scratch, but I don't know if that's a good idea... Maybe it's more wise to use a library? I also started to think about what state management tool we will be using. Is redux okay?


[10/28/2021 1:00 PM] gnuion#3794
Or are react hooks sufficient?

Hello @platos_solids! Should we create a telegram group for our project we can chat about?


[10/30/2021 8:38 AM] gnuion#3794
About the UI library. I checked tailwind and material UI. They both require payment to enjoy full features. Correct me if I am wrong. On the other hand Semantic UI looks to be completely free.


[10/30/2021 10:03 AM] platos_solids#8520

So i have started a basic flow diagram to move toward the wireframe, please do add comments, changes and information, this flow diagram is just to capture the key information some parts of the flow which is common to any website is understood, on the left hand side on tabs with data on page just keep adding any kind of button or information that you think should be seen on it. i will organize and remove as i see fit so do not worry about that. once we more or less agree on the overall flow i shall move to wireframing the prototype


[10/31/2021 5:55 AM] platos_solids#8520
cheers and have a great day team. ( i am not sure if this information already exists somewhere but as a designer i am just going about my process so do notify me when you see redundant stuff. PS i cannot read code efficiently enough that is why i require stuff like this lol )


[10/31/2021 5:56 AM] platos_solids#8520
this will continue being adapted and edited it is underprocess and collaborative

If you're using the ergo logo you should use those guidelines in general but no restrictions otherwise afaik


[11/06/2021 11:00 AM] platos_solids#8520
One of these can be the ergo fund logo , it would be cool if you guys could maybe vote on one, or if there are other options let me know and i can integrate that to the webpage.

I am trying to make a nextjs app for ergofund. If you want to step in that could be great!


[11/13/2021 8:10 PM] gnuion#3794
https://ergofund.vercel.app/
As you can see I made little to no progress. I think however I made a solid choice with nextjs. I also decided to use css modules instead of styled components because of separation between application business and styling. However it also got its downsides by having to jump more around files.  Maybe I start learning Semantic UI or Material UI and start working that way instead of writing CSS myself.

[11/14/2021 12:03 AM] rafaelsv#9903
@glasgowm Awesome that is what I'm looking for, trying to help the community.


[11/14/2021 12:05 AM] rafaelsv#9903
@gnuion Where are you looking at what needs to be built for the frontend? Do you have like a set of functional requirements or what is the scope/features of what this project is going to support? I'm just lost not understanding what is going to be there. I suppose once @platos_solids has the figma ready we can chat about the modules to build and the screens with the right flow.


[11/14/2021 12:08 AM] rafaelsv#9903
Nextjs is a great solution, and I always prefer to use some sort of UI Library cause otherwise the work is too much and also working as a team it's best to have something that is documented already and we all know how to use/develop with the most basic UI elements. I've been using Chakra-UI https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui recently and the teams that I've been working with have been able to understand how to use it very quickly and we've been very productive as a whole. Think of it as a Tailwind UI but developed directly with React in mind


[11/14/2021 6:25 AM] gnuion#3794
Awesome! In the meantime I start learning Chakra-UI. I clearly don't have as much experience as you do, so bare with me üòÖ. It's great to have an experienced frontend developer in the team! üòÅ Regarding state management what do you prefer, for example redux, react hooks or both?


[11/14/2021 7:23 PM] rafaelsv#9903
I reach out to redux via the redux toolkit and rtk-query when the app is going to use a lot of data from the backend, and if there are a lot of global state used across multiple parts in the app, otherwise just redux hooks, with something like context api

this is the link to the figma link, please note this is not fully complete and still requires 2-3 pages remaining like dashboard and finer details from all of your comments, after discussing changes @gnuion and @rafaelsv can tell me which parts they will require first and i shall structure the figma clearly in that hierarchy, so that we can work on things simultaneously, right now the figma is NOT ready for hand over


[11/16/2021 1:15 AM] platos_solids#8520
i recommend using the desktop client as we are using a free figma it keeps crashing even for slightly heavy files

Great work! As a user, I would want to go straight into searching a project, but I can't find the search bar on the first page. It would be also nice to have the cards display information about current progress of funding. What percentage of the goal is reached.


[11/16/2021 8:02 AM] platos_solids#8520
aah solid suggestions, will incorporate üëç


[11/18/2021 5:18 AM] lgd#5847
I feel like these options don't really say anything about funding. It's cool that all the ergo logos for the different projects are different, it makes it more fun. Maybe there is a way to indicate that it's related to funding, money, or projects? I think another cool example is the ergo-lend logo, which doesn't even have the sigma, its two hands shaking hands around the octagon. Just as an idea for example, maybe the sigma could be like a piggy bank and have a dollar sign on top of it, as though you are filling it up with money? I like the gold-like color though.

the old logo was something like you described right? i have no issues implementing that if that is what is preferred, guess the team just has to take a call

Hello! I have created a temporary github repository for the frontend, but it isn't very active. It uses nextjs and vercel for hosting. You can if you want play around, fork it, open threads, contribute or anything you would like. I am currently taking a nextjs course and after that I want to write some code for ergofund. https://github.com/gnuion/ergofund-frontend

[11/24/2021 8:11 PM] LADOPIXŒ£L#6072
It occurs to me to adapt ErgoRaffle for ErgoFund by reducing the winning percentage to 0% and allocating the remaining 100% minus the fees to the charity management.

In theory, the minimum amount, the duration of time and the different participants are already contemplated, it would only be necessary to modify the code to send the money to the creator of the crowdfunding alone (charity), instead of dividing it in 2 to send the different percentages.

I do not know if it is contemplated that each person who contributes to crowdfunding must obtain a reward that they have previously selected.


[12/08/2021 6:57 PM] rafaelsv#9903
@gnuion @platos_solids would you guys say that the design for ergo fund is approved? If that is the case I can start slicing the modules from it. I think there was a plan to make it responsive as well so we start from mobile towards desktop


[12/08/2021 7:04 PM] gnuion#3794
Yes, sounds modern! Will we use chakra-ui? The benefit of using a ui library is that many of the coding is done for you and you don't need to worry too much about responsibility.


[12/08/2021 7:19 PM] gnuion#3794
I think https://ergopad.io/ is similar to ergofund. I think they are doing a great job and are good organized.


[12/08/2021 8:36 PM] rafaelsv#9903
We can build any frontend as long as we have the design for it

Slicing it is not a problem, it's creating the design and idea that takes time


[12/08/2021 8:39 PM] rafaelsv#9903
I'll get started this week creating the boilerplate and slicing some of the card modules, once we have the modules we can place them in different ways


[12/14/2021 2:37 PM] rafaelsv#9903
hey @gnuion could you invite me to your repo, I'll send tonight the baseline for a nextjs project with Chakra-UI and Storybook so we can start slicing the modules


[12/14/2021 4:38 PM] gnuion#3794
Sure! I have started learning Chakra-UI and I must say it's awesome! Love the built in dark mode feature! Fantastic! Is this your github? https://github.com/Rafael-SV

Cool, sent an invitation. It looks like there are three concurrent projects, ergoraffle, egopad and ergofund. I don't have a clear documentation for the ergofund project, just that it should look something like giveth. We might figure out things as we go. For me it is a very interesting journey and I am so happy people here are so  keen to help! @rafaelsv you are now the core frontend developer for ergofund I guess.


[12/14/2021 9:24 PM] rafaelsv#9903
Thank you @gnuion I believe in all of us having the same level of involvement in this and helping each other out to accomplish our goal which I know will have more people involved as soon as we get this moving

Build a Modern User Interface with Chakra UI
After completing this course, you will be able to build well-designed user interfaces without spending a lot of time (if even) styling every component and element. You will drastically simplify your front-end work and learn to modify and build on top of existing design systems.

[02/10/2022 7:26 AM] NoahErgo#4349
Any updates on this?


[02/11/2022 2:52 AM] wombatz#4715
what exactly is Ergo Fund?


[02/19/2022 6:15 PM] gnuion#3794
Not really, I got stuck on state management. I am just a junior software developer. Having docs around Ergo Fund would help. To the answer what exactly Ergo Fund is, I don't know. Maybe a dapp that aims to be similar to ergoraffle and ergopad.


[02/23/2022 12:04 PM] glasgowm#9381
ErgoRaffle is a crowdfunder too, I suppose it's kinda similar to ergopad too but hadn't thought about it that way. 

But ErgoFund is just the more fleshed out version with more bells & whistles AFAIK but maybe @kushti can add to this. 

Would be cool if you could do stuff like see all the DAOs (once we have DAOs) and contribute to them,  kick-start projects (could even implement refundable ICOs).

is this project dead?

i remember seeing a ui mockup that was pretty cool.


[04/11/2022 7:36 PM] lgd#5847
this project could really be useful to smaller projects looking for crowd funding without legal issues selling tokens, something kinda like kickstarter.

I am trying to understand what the backend does. I ran the docker-compose up command and now this is the output on my terminal. What is it doing?

Just looks like it's processing the chain?

```
Thus this scanner is providing a way to scan and extract boxes and corresponding transactions block-by-block, with forks handling, database storage, configurable database schema and blockchain scanning rules.
```

[04/20/2022 8:31 PM] gnuion#3794
I am keen to learn more üòä.  This is so cool! So the campaigns are stored on the blockchain and the backend is extracting the information from the blockchain? Are there any campaigns active yet? Does ergoraffle use this backend?


[04/27/2022 12:33 AM] gnuion#3794
Guys, added redux-toolkit to the frontend and setup automatic hook generation for the fetch API. This is very cool! Maybe you can give me some input of how the interface for a campaign should look like. Here a sample of how an interface looks like:

```typescript
interface Campaign {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  image: {
    url: string;
  };
}
```


[04/27/2022 12:37 AM] ezi0.audit0re#1533
Hey guys.

The backend is using https://github.com/ergoplatform/scanner. Once you setup the backend, the scanner starts and searches the network block by block to find the boxes we need. e.g. campaign boxes, seller box, campaign setting box, etc.


[04/27/2022 12:38 AM] ezi0.audit0re#1533
ErgoRaffle is not using this backend. They have their own backend available here: https://github.com/ErgoRaffle/raffle-backend

[04/27/2022 12:39 AM] gnuion#3794
So cool! Okay, we need to extract information and put it on the docs.


[04/27/2022 12:39 AM] ezi0.audit0re#1533
Definietly.


[04/27/2022 12:45 AM] gnuion#3794
Can we separate the scanner as a microservice? I like using express.js, just learned it, and would like to use it. I never used Scala before. So I'd only need to know the API for the scanner  and how it works. What data does it send, and what data does it store. Campaign images are for example too heavy, so we might use something like Arweave permaweb to store those and use the information on the blockchain as a pointer.


[04/27/2022 12:47 AM] ezi0.audit0re#1533
The scanner is a separate service. If you look at the docker compose file here: https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergofund/blob/main/docker-compose.yml

You can see that the backend (which is written in nodejs) communicates with the scanner (which is written in scala).

[04/27/2022 12:48 AM] ezi0.audit0re#1533
What the frontend really needs is the API that the backend provides. It would not want to directly contact the scanner.


[04/27/2022 12:49 AM] ezi0.audit0re#1533
For the images, surely we have to store them on a separate file server. IPFS is the best choice to store the original images.


[04/27/2022 12:49 AM] ezi0.audit0re#1533
We can leverage a centralized file server like Amazon S3 to server thumbnails if we want.


[04/27/2022 12:50 AM] ezi0.audit0re#1533
Or maybe IPFS for thumbnails too :))


[04/27/2022 12:50 AM] gnuion#3794
No, web2 as less as possible.


[04/27/2022 12:51 AM] gnuion#3794
As for development, we can surely use web2 at first, but plan to make more and more features web3.


[04/27/2022 12:52 AM] ezi0.audit0re#1533
Not sure what you mean by web3 but I believe using decentralized approaches like IPFS is fair.


[04/27/2022 12:53 AM] gnuion#3794
web3 means trustless, where mathematics and law of physics are the 3rd party. You can come up with your own definition of web3 üòÇ.


[04/27/2022 12:54 AM] ezi0.audit0re#1533
Good.


[04/27/2022 12:55 AM] ezi0.audit0re#1533
By the way, the EIP of ErgoFund has changed and I believe the backend should change too.


[04/27/2022 12:58 AM] gnuion#3794
Well, I'll try to bake something with web2. When the backend is ready, we make it web3. I will try to make a indiegogo clone with a dummy mongodb database. Then we replace some of the database with ergofund backend api.


[04/27/2022 1:04 AM] ezi0.audit0re#1533
I agree.


[06/13/2022 8:30 PM] LADOPIXŒ£L#6072
I already have the backend working at local, I'm going to start working on a frontend on my own, I'll upload the progress.
