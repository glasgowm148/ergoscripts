We have 90 candidates in total now. These are the 30 planned for first SIGCAN cohort. Let me know if there are any objections, you should be able to see this via the onboarding doc too. 

Figure this is better than opening the floodgates straight away. Could also be reduced to a smaller number if preferable.

@Sigmanauts please vote !

**SIGCAN COHORT 1 PROPOSAL**

**Proposal**: The following (33) people to be admitted to the training programme as 'sigmanaut candidates' (SIGCAN). They were added based on the time they able to commit, experience, and activity within the community. 

**Voting**: Vote must be passed unanimously (no one disagrees) using the thumbs up/down emoji's on the comments contained within this thread. Everyone gets a tag/notification and then has 24 hours to respond (to allow for timezones, other commitments, etc). Please read the thread below, reply there with any concerns or additions.

Congrats @Sigmanauts  - your first vote that'll impact how Ergo operates. 

**Proposal**: Should Lunadog get their own channel on Discord. (#lunadog)

- Don't want to open the floodgates to every shitcoin. 
- $COMET does have one, but I suppose at least @JOFLITO is doing a SC
- They are on ErgoDex however. 

**Voting:** Same rules as above. Please discuss in the nested thread - and use the emoji's to vote

I'm going to start setting up some votes to admit some @SigCan into the @Sigmanauts role then invite some more SIGCANs in. (Or we can leave them a bit longer - up for discussion)

Please discuss in the thread for each person. (You should have perms to create one here). Use Emoji's to vote.  Will let this run til Monday to get enough votes

Overall, I'm really optimistic for the direction Ergo has been heading in, and I constantly see improvements.

I want to add something for those who maybe don't follow him asking to check him out before voting. I think he'd be a great asset. No "ergo maxi" vibes, sincere appreciation, killer threads (not daily, but to the point), twitter peppered with appreciation for other chains too (pro: utxo alliance ones, like ckb). (No idea why my name is pink, but I like it :1636happypepe: )

5 more applicants over the past 10 days @Sigmanauts. Please evaluate  vote & start threads with any comments.

he's got great ideas, is very passionate about anything ERG and ADA and has been active on socials since I joined Ergo


[05/16/2022 6:51 PM] Chris Ray#2713
Before I vote yet more into the Sigcan program it seems like a good idea to reevaluate who is already a part of it and question whether or not they should remain in it at all or if they should be advanced forward, not a very lively bunch over there tbh (just consider me abstaining).

I've labelled them all here

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yv3EJcLsp8tY-E827BhdaQH9Io-QJizb5guHzmS6aZo/edit#gid=1621253460

32 total - There's a few active elsewhere that are probably due a sigmanauts promotion.

- FathersFollly / AffableVillain (very active on the reddit moderation/answering Qs)
- Alex Tuturescu - active in the community spaces, made up those romanian graphics
- Sisyphuspush participating in ERGOHACK with an idea similar to the sigmanauts

Then you have people like AllCloudy (GetBlok) illya (Sigmavalley), Edd Norris (Harmony One Ambassador?) who I'm thinking worthwhile promoting. I suppose it depends on how active we want people to be in the programme itself to get the promotion. 

~10 I could trim for inactivity - but also a few I'd be prone to leave for SIGCANs a while longer to see if they do anything.

**[PROPOSAL] Promotion to Sigmanaut**
@Affable Villain

~ 2 months of active moderation on r/ergonauts

https://old.reddit.com/user/FathersFolly/

**What would you improve**
> I value Ergo for what it is. Being a very "grass roots" oriented project, it brings me joy to witness the brilliance and creativity of various Ergo developers, as well as Foundation and community members, in finding workarounds to problems that many other projects could and/or would simply throw money at until they went away. What I would like to see improved is the public understanding of what Ergo is, freed from recurring misconceptions, and to have a clarity brought to the visualization of what Ergo and it's blooming ecosystem could be.

**Roles**

[PROPOSAL] Demote SIGCANs

So these 7 selected I think can probably demote. They can always re-apply if they become more active. I'd give the 4 above a bit longer.

I'm wondering if most are even aware they're SigCans and where to go to get involved with the Sigmanaut program. I know it took me quite a while before I understood what was going on.


[05/18/2022 11:08 PM] Chris Ray#2713
Ya maybe we need to do proper introduction


[05/19/2022 12:15 PM] glasgowm#9381
Not to dissuade yous, but I think a good % of people forget about crypto when the price is down. The ones up on the chopping block I think that's the case. But can contact them individually and checkup.


[05/19/2022 12:25 PM] glasgowm#9381
Pinned a message.


[05/19/2022 7:37 PM] Chris Ray#2713
Ya we don't need to remove them, you are so correct, people get depressed when crypto is down and might stay away, or even take part at a lesser capacity.


[05/23/2022 9:09 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
Is our long term goal to onboard as many Sigmanauts into program as possible? I guess it'd be unwise to hard-cap admission numbers, but maybe it's possible to have too many Sigmanauts? Just curious, something I've been thinking about lately &  I'd appreciate hearing other opinions.  :)

Ergo doesn't have to become Marques Brownlee but if Space Design Warehouse can do killer videos with barely any followers so can the Ergo Community imo.

@Sigmanauts I propose that we start using a super-majority vote that must reach a threshold of 90% to include new people into the Sigmanaut program, this should apply to active votes only and a vote *not present* should be an indication of abstaining or acquiesce,this 90% threshhold should include bringing people into the SigCan role and continue as people are promoted to Sigmanaut/ Captain and other roles that may come up in the future, I propose this so that no single person slows this program down.

This proposal will run for one week and I will withdraw it if it gains any votes against it

Please vote Below, this needs to be a unanimous decision or we just continue what we have been doing which has obvious problems when someone does not come online.

 👍  = In favor of 90% voting threshold.

👎 = Not in favor of 90% threshold.

I want to add to this; I think a majority or super majority should vote for the vote to be valid 
A quorum of 60% seems pretty doable

[09/12/2022 3:34 PM] Chris Ray#2713
I think that would be good also, would be reason for someone who is proposing to promote someone to go ensure they get enough votes.

@Sigmanauts - There is a new SIGCAN Applicant: @bubsandstonks
Roles: Creator

Experience: Academic with PhD in Chemistry (academic research writing/editing)
Improvements:Ergo's tech is insanely good and sophisticated and there are some really incredible developers and probably jets coming out that will truly be revolutionary. However, one thing I would improve (and I understand this has to start at the grassroots level) is the fostering of RealFi projects. The manifesto talks about a blockchain for the People, so there should be projects that are approachable for non-tech people to still participants and stakeholders. Something that comes to mind is maybe a mining pool project that links to agriculture. Something that takes the act of mining and boot straps it to the securing of food production. Or simpler projects like getting local businesses to start accepting Ergo as payment (similar to the massive BCH following in North Queensland, Australia).
Of course these ideas take devs to make them, but I think Ergo should start getting put into the hands of "regular" people as soon as possible.

I suggest Dingo go straight through to Sigmanaut. He has written 3 articles which have been published on our blog under "Blockchain for Beginners" and has a few more in the pipeline. We need more writers for articles,  he is already in the contributors channel but recently changed name to ErgoDingo

Has Ergodesign been in the candidate tier and contributed enough to be promoted? I saw some commentary and since I don't know what they've been up to, I thought I'd ask.

Would like to make a note here, we do not have a timeframe for voting decided on as a procedure that we have voted in to be practiced, how long should the vote be available? We should really hammer down on this, should I make a proposal for a timeframe @Sigmanauts ?
Or any one of you can also.
Let's develop some operating procedures so we are all clear on how to move forward, otherwise we are just shooting from the hip making proposal's.
