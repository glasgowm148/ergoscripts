Do you know any casino games that might have an easy ergo script ? 
I was thinking about poker but it's quit hard 
I mean creating a game and solving the hand afterwards is not that challenging but call, raise and check are going to be complex 

on the other hand games like poker which requires user wallet interaction might not possible because of transaction time 
also unlike other wallets like Metamask, Yoroi doesn't give you access to wallet and user has to go to her wallet and send erg then come back and continue the game.


[10/08/2021 4:11 PM] glasgowm#9381
Not aware of any existing contracts for that @ERGOHACK Mentor ?

Yes the block-time does make certain types of gaming impractical. There is a dApp connector (like metamask) in beta but not sure if it provides that access.

Can you tell me how can I figure this out ? if we have the access it makes it a lot easier 
anyone used the dapp connector ?

and slot machines are really close to lotteries there are just more conditions and more winners instead of just one person taking everything

slot machine would be an easy implementation yes. so for a card game, what is necessary to encode all combinations into ergoscript? What would be the steps?


[10/08/2021 4:56 PM] catalyst244#7869
We can do some stuff off-chain but that wouldn't make a true dApp 
if we need a completely decentralized game, we might have to.

[10/08/2021 8:53 PM] sepehr#3795
I totally agree with it. we can have a short chat to share some ideas


[10/08/2021 8:54 PM] catalyst244#7869
I actually wanted to implement roulette initially but I didn't have the sufficient funds to backup a casino üòÖ  that's why I proceed towards multiplayer games instead of games that are playing against casino.


[10/08/2021 10:00 PM] Thales#6915
yes but you can always start small, with max amount and by the law of large numbers, you will not lose right?


[10/08/2021 10:00 PM] Thales#6915
we actually have a very nice plan, but we want to keep it on low key until we go live. we think it could go viral !

Great, our team will be available tomorrow early, so if you would propose any time, we would be up for it!


[10/08/2021 10:45 PM] mhs_sam#1471
Idea about what exactly?üòÄ 
I think roulette is very easy to implement but games like poker or card games are much harder. So, if you want to proceed, let's start with a simple game like roulette. Later you can add more complicated games to your casino.

‚ÄúThoughts on this Dapp idea?

Decentralized Casino. I've mentioned this before in the telegram, but would love to see it and believe it would drive adoption to crypto in general.

People can provide liquidity and be the 'house' and others can bet on classic casino games like roulette, blackjack, which all slightly favor the house (like normal casinos).

So if someone plays roulette, hits red and wins they get their winnings, if they lose, it goes to the house rewarding those that provided liquidity.

Could then add sports at some point using oracle pools.

Is anyone still looking for a Casino-style idea? If you are interested in targeting the Japanese market for example which I think could be interesting then you could look into making a Pachinko style game with people being able to redeem their winnings for NFTs for example

[01/07/2022 12:23 AM] timreg7#6732
J, I know that native Americans in the US run most of the casinos in the country. Gambling is heavily regulated here, but they host it on reservations where they are sovereign (not sure if you're from the us). My point is that if you develop this, you could probably market the code to them and help them develop their own version of it with their brand. Online gambling is illegal here, too, even for them, so integrating the mixer might empower them to do what they want and access a bigger market.


[01/07/2022 12:26 AM] timreg7#6732
I also know there is a lot of inequality in how the funds from those casinos are distributed. A dao or a profit sharing dapp like you mentioned might be a good, transparent solution for this. These communities are often very poor and rely on income from gaming, so this could be really helpful for them if it was able to be done fairly.


[01/07/2022 7:38 PM] J - The Ergod#0899
i like it -i would have to look into it more as i dont know much about how they operate but it could be a good lane to go after. thanks for bringing it up


[01/07/2022 10:58 PM] timreg7#6732
For sure. It might be a major hurdle to get them on board, but they distrust of the us government  and crypto could really power them if they did it right. I know it's a long ways out, but if you ever want to pursue this I would be glad to help.

We are writing a swap contract that can swap our Night Owl token for sigUSD in 1:100 ratio. The contract simply has an arbitarily large amount of Night Owl tokens and when paid sigUSD releases some amount of Night Owl Tokens and stores the sigUSD for later redemption.

[02/11/2022 2:13 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Would be good to hear your thoughts ^^ as this Swap contract is similar to how Im thinking our liquidity contract will be. Whenever you are free üôÇ

@scalahub please feel free to check also


[02/11/2022 5:02 PM] kushti#0978
Likely similar to emission box contract you made


[02/11/2022 5:08 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
ahhh okay, potentially was just going to replace this implementation with user writing to register or using proxy contract but this could work too


[02/11/2022 5:50 PM] J - The Ergod#0899
update on frontend: @liquid_phase  is implementing the css classes necessary to turn the mockup into a web-ready UI, and  is about 75% done with the home page CSS/JS. Once the home page is done, he is creating the swap and coin flip pages, which will go quickly since they are smaller modules than the whole page


[02/11/2022 6:10 PM] kushti#0978
will there be only one box with this contract ?


[02/11/2022 6:13 PM] kushti#0978
@Krasavice Blasen sigUSD is denominated in cents, so with tokenAmount * 100 , you're selling 100 owls for 1 US cent ?


[02/11/2022 6:43 PM] J - The Ergod#0899
good catch, 1 owl should =  1 cent - thanks!

[02/11/2022 10:03 PM] J - The Ergod#0899
Hey @root7Z - For **frontend**, home page is 90% done.  Liquid mentions the site code is playing nice with responsiveness and menu break point. Only missing finishing up connect wallet button and some minor styling details. Liquid will then proceed with coin flip page and swap page (these should be quick).  Mockup for swap will be finalized tonight by Fuzy. For **backend**,  Supreme continues working on Nautilus integration and should be mostly done by tonight.  The smart contract for swap and liquidity is complete. Roulette contract is under review (will provide completed tomorrow). Coinflip smart contract will be completed by tomorrow as well.  Started work on designing ErgoMixer integration. We are on track to launch first game by end of hackathon for testing. In addition, worked on updating white paper and put out a blog on Night Owl privacy and security.

Yes although unsure how and if its necesary to have this in multiple boxes. With high usage will tx-chaining be fast enough?

@kushti 
What is the best approach to access the next block header Id in a script.
I have done this: 
```val index = HEIGHT - SELF.creationInfo._1 - 2
val randomNumber = byteArrayToLong(CONTEXT.headers(index).id)```


[02/12/2022 8:11 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
I felt this approach was good since from any CONTEXT, the index points to SELF creationHeight + 1


[02/12/2022 8:12 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
But Ive used this before and had trouble with txs not being mined and occassionally removed from mempool, maybe theres a better way?


[02/12/2022 8:26 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
What do you mean by next blockId?


[02/12/2022 8:35 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
And what happens if say the box is spent 15 blocks after it was created, wouldn't that make the transaction invalid? I think you can only access the last 10 headers in from CONTEXT but have to double check


[02/12/2022 9:10 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
next block header id


[02/12/2022 9:11 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
correct. But they should be spent withing 10 blocks. Theres no way to reference further than 10 without storing the block header id somewhere


[02/12/2022 9:27 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Ah I see so the box is designed to be spent within 10 blocks. Maybe it's being dropped if a miner attempts to include the transaction when `HEIGHT == SELF.creationInfo._1 + 1`? That would make index = -1


[02/12/2022 9:28 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Ive been broadcasting the txs after 2 block delay.


[02/12/2022 9:29 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
the method may actually be sound and that something else in the script was causing this. Was mainly interested to see if this is even a good approach at all


[02/12/2022 9:40 AM] ahrnsetido#7634
Here's some ppt slides explaining the swap contract @Krasavice Blasen and I have designed.

Locking SigUSD into OWL liquidity means more usage of SigUSD -> more incentive for people to mint SigUSD -> more TVL in Ergo ecosystem -> better SigRSV performance for RSV bagholders -> Gamble on liquidity you provided so you earn fees on your own LP -> PROFIT

Will you guys have a way to settle bets like if someone in trading chat says i bet this is the last dip.. they lose how can that get paid out? randomized mediators get paid or something?

interesting (re @fruittree: then people can make more broad bets lol)


[03/21/2022 6:17 PM] fruittree#0000
say everyone gets like 3 options(approve, ???, flag/open disbute), mediator gets like 2% if all parties approve, 1% if parties didn't approve and it goes on to extra mediation costing extra fees which are held upon signing..


[03/21/2022 6:18 PM] fruittree#0000
maybe an option for not sufficiently specific bet and it all gets refunded minus fees as a third option..


[03/21/2022 6:21 PM] fruittree#0000
with 3 approvals it closed contract.. with a mix it goes into a extra mediator space where there are a range of fees depending on ho well mediator is rated or what route he chooses.


[03/21/2022 6:22 PM] fruittree#0000
Front end just needs a bet description, and later the approve/dispute pages.. I'd pressure peopel into betting a lot more online with this kind of tool


[03/21/2022 6:23 PM] fruittree#0000

Glasgow mediating every other bet


[03/21/2022 6:30 PM] fruittree#0000
ok paying 5%  of your bet for a dispute or some extra level with a conversation that gets reviewed by multiple mediators..


[03/21/2022 6:32 PM] fruittree#0000
if someone is upset about losing, they continually choose dispute options.. maybe because mediators are corrupted or because they are just wanting to perpetually lock up the funds to not let them be released.. then what?


[03/21/2022 7:00 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
no plans for that yet but good idea ! going to share it in the discord public ideas channel. i think the tough part would be figuring out the mediator aspect or how that could be agreed upon

No problem, the King's Prize pot continues to get bigger and bigger... How big do you think it can get? Will you win it all? ü§î üëëüí∞üåôü¶â

in all of the casino games, it is assumed a percentage goes to the founders, right? 
but also liquidity providers, do they become the house?

what will be the founders cut?


[04/05/2022 6:42 PM] Jack_ington#0000
imo, there has to be enough incentive to keep the casino looking nice and inviting, but also liquidity providers will of course want a piece of that. just curious really

Are there any casino project already running succesfully on any other blockchain or this is the first ?


[04/22/2022 3:09 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
yea there‚Äôs many other casino projects, this is the first fully open source / decentralized and first w own stable token

 Great....
How are u guys gonna make randomness in the games so that nobody or urself can crack it or hack it .


[04/22/2022 3:18 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
two methods of rng depending on the game. one using oracle pools (verifiably random) for faster paced games. second method is Verifiable Delay Functions (VDF) for slower paced like lottery


[04/22/2022 3:19 PM] J - The Ergod#0000

 Yes you will get OWL for providing liquidity based on profit from the casino. There will be not be any extra rewards for long term holders, there will however be a lock period of 1 month to prevent attempts at gaming the system

 yea - when providing liquidity, you are acting as the ‚Äòhouse‚Äô. Meaning if a player wins a bet, the money from the liquidity pool would go to the player. if they lose, the money would go to the pool as profit and split between the liquidity providers. Every casino game is built with a house advantage, meaning long term the providers will always make a profit.

1 sigusd= 100 OWL so in this scenario you would swap 100 sig usd for 10k OWL then go to the liquidity provision page and provide liquidity. the image is a mock-up

essentially you  ‚Äòstake‚Äô your owl in the liquidity provision page to participate in the profits


[04/22/2022 4:35 PM] NoahErgo#0000
What happens if the house pool gets drained by big wins and there arent any people putting back sigusd into pool, are OWL holders fucked?

 If OWL is also the governance token, then how do you ensure decentralized governance?


[05/02/2022 10:30 PM] KrasaviceBlasen#0000
> KrasaviceBlasen re @Ile: If OWL is also the governance token, then how ... 
 
 I would pose that our vision is kind of analogous to the blockchain itself. Night Owl will have its core foundational protocols (things you cannot change without a hard fork) and on top of that there will be votable facets to the platform (soft forks)


[05/02/2022 10:34 PM] KrasaviceBlasen#0000
In regards to the token- it may not necessarily be what is used to vote but it could be what qualifies you to vote through a snapshot. Snapshots can also give information about the type of voter you are (a player, a LP provider, etc) and these factors could allow for custom voting rules (like soft forks pertaining to a gaming category should represent the players more)

```
1. Random Number Generator
    1.1 VDF(Verifiable delay function) implementation for higher security games (lottery)
    1.2 ETH Oracle-Based RNG for dynamic and fast paced games like Roulette

2. Creating a React Package that embeds the dApp connector for Nautilus and maybe for Safew too, and also includes the possibility of retrieving amount of tokens in the wallet and display them (therefore not only the connection to the dApp itself) this way any new dApp would simply have to import the package as a dependencie and not have to worry about coding the dApp connector

3. Create a resilient ETH oracle scanner, which will use the block headers on the ETH block chain and pair them with unconfirmed night owl bets from the ERG block chain (for the dynamic games mentioned above)

4. Create bet verifier for roulette, this will analyze the oracle scanner and execute the pay outs to the player on a win or to the house if it's a loss

5. Finish Roulette, backend and frontend wise, which has been a hard game to develop so far! 

6. Keep developing what we already have specified in our roadmap, but at a higher speed and asking for some ErgoScript suggestions

7. Implement lottery and it‚Äôs respective VDF based rng

I always wanted to improve the lottery system on pancakeswap by using marbles on stream to do a power ball type of lottery


[05/12/2022 2:52 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
6 races


[05/12/2022 2:52 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
10 marbles 0-9


[05/12/2022 2:52 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
Last race is the power ball


[05/12/2022 2:52 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
Stream it on twitch


[05/12/2022 2:53 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
So there‚Äôs entertainment factor as well as proof of no malfeasance since there is no true randomness on the block chain

have you guys looked into this for random number source?: https://www.random.org/

https://www.random.org/
RANDOM.ORG - True Random Number Service
RANDOM.ORG offers true random numbers to anyone on the Internet. The randomness comes from atmospheric noise, which for many purposes is better than the pseudo-random number algorithms typically used in computer programs.

Everything is great, but what will admins do with angry people, who will lose?
Yeah, it will be a pure casino, but human nature is to blame someone else in failures

odds are transparent

(re @ibetuwill : *Everything is great, but what will admins do with angry people, who will lose?

 if you go to the slots and lose all your money, you dont complain to the casino managers


[05/14/2022 9:13 PM] NoahErgo#0000
in this case its even less an issue because its all smart contract based. If they complain, so what? It‚Äôs their fault if they gambled more than they can risk


[05/14/2022 9:23 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
it‚Äôs decentralized + anyone can choose to play or not, or provide liquidity or not. we‚Äôre as transparent and fair as possible, but the choice to play will always be there.

1/2 As you all know, we had originally targeted July to launch V0.1.0. At this time, it's looking like we will have to push back this date to September. A LOT of progress has been made, but we need to ensure we have time to properly test before launching.

Ahh ok.  Currently betting on games but the 20% cut from the middle kinda hurts. I mean you could copy the odds from other gambling site just create a pool for people to send the money before the game starts then automatically distribute the winnings depends on how many people bet or something with lesser cut.

‚ÄúGreat points! The Night Owl team is currently using private servers and domain hosting. Longer-term goals include having a downloadable client (like ErgoMixer). Ideally, we want to build a platform where if it's shut down for whatever reason, it can be sprung up by anyone. NO is also exploring additional options like the one you mentioned!
This is a community project so any input is highly encouraged!‚Äù

As of tomorrow, new developers will no longer have to worry about their Ergo dApp connection if they code in React. Just a few clicks, and they will be ready to go. 

Expect the release and demo tomorrow!

The package contains a component that is an Ergo dApp Connector, which means that by downloading it and calling it in your code, you will have handled the whole dApp Connection!

 Same type of question ...
Like in coin flick game...the coin flip for every individual is different and flip it any time player want....
Or it is flipped every few minutes collectively and all the player during this time will see the same result?

 The ETH block header is 32 bytes long, 5f50653f6ca5c70c3e1d1ea5cdb375ea7184eef1411e8c30cad911f1710191b5 and heads or tails requires just a 1 or 0 and the ETH block hash has 265 of them so when a user plays coin flip there would be a 1/256 chance of getting the same ETH hash digit as someone else

[06/01/2022 1:15 PM] J - The Ergod#0000

[06/01/2022 1:17 PM] shivshuttler#0000
(re @TheRealErgoGod : *yes, we havent made coin flip yet but likely all flips will be unique*) 
 
 Ok...
I am asking it because suppose every second there are 20k player playing coin flip game...is there chance in that sec...or any time frame like in 5 milliseconds ...they all will get the same result...


[06/01/2022 1:21 PM] shivshuttler#0000
I thought coin flip will work like in every 2 min. there will be coin flip ..in that 2 min. Player will select there side of choice...and then the coin will be flipped after 2 min...all those player who chooses that side will will and others will loose.....
It might be done with 2 min. Block time of ergo??
Do you think anything sensible here which is good??

(re @Rj : *Can the coin flick be automatic like a built in bot?*) 
 
 what do you mean ?


[06/02/2022 7:51 PM] Rj#0000
I played before a coin flip game. Where you can set parameters like when it loses it would double the bet on the next round and a parameter would be added if how many rounds would it bet twice than before it would reset the bet amount. The bot would bet always heads or tails or randomly per round. It would stop if the funds where drained.

[06/07/2022 5:02 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
Would it be possible to set up the casino with a game in a way where if you lose your bet a portion of the bet is sent to a burn address instead of just the house winning? Eventually the funds could be mined out through the storage fees if the wallet went dormant. IDK just thought this would be a cool little feature to add to a game.


[06/07/2022 5:04 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
def possible

Looking at the architecture, it looks like the backend determines the random number and submits to the smart contract. Can you clarify how you are preventing someone from just submitting their own random number to the smart contract

(re  : *<Marty> Looking at the architecture, it looks like the backend determines the random number and submits to the smart contract. Can you clarify how you are preventing someone from just submitting their own random number to the smart contract*) 
 
 We will be constructing an oracle. 
Any user can run the eth scanner and report the latest boxes and hashes. 
We have not built the consensus contract, but essentially there will be a contract that holds an oracle NFT and can be spent based on various consensus rules. For our games, they will check that the dataInput has this oracle NFT (our game contracts dont do this yet, but will be modified when we make the consensus contract)


[06/10/2022 2:09 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
We are going to open roulette to test without the consensus contract


[06/10/2022 2:09 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
We will also test with consensus, but most of the bugs we may run into will be with other parts of the game


[06/10/2022 2:10 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
We dont believe we can use the current oracle contracts since they handle a single datapoint and the contracts just take the average, that is why we are making our own btw

 Hey guys - Guess i should post on it here. It was mostly due to some clash of personalities + disagreements in monetary values. We are still in good standing with Fuzy and wish him the best moving forward and he will be properly compensated for his time. Just had to do what‚Äôs best for Night Owls future and what we thought was fair to all members of the team.

(re @KrasaviceBlasen : *In regards to the token- it may not necessarily be what is used to vote but it could be what qualifies you to vote through a snapshot. Snapshots can also give information about the type of voter you are (a player, a LP provider, etc) and these factors could allow for custom voting rules (like soft forks pertaining to a gaming category should represent the players more)*) 
 
 üëç I liked the ideas for testing different kinds of voting systems here.

I just don't see how "democratic" could be achieved without IDs. So, dropped by to shill ErgoNation again üòÑ

 Shooting some questions while listening to this. 

How does owl minting work? Send 1 sigusd to smart contract, get 100 OWL? 

Or something fancier?

Is that contract immutable?

(re @Ile : *Shooting some questions while listening to this. 

How does owl minting work? Send 1 sigusd to smart contract, get 100 OWL? 

Or something fancier?

Is that contract immutable?*) 
 
 there‚Äôs actually some info on that here!:

(re @TheRealErgoGod : *there‚Äôs actually some info on that here!:*) 
 
 I am not technical enough to understand all that, so pardon me if I ask something that is already in there.

I can see the need for upgradeability. SigUSD, or some other stablecoin might have problems at some point. You just need to be really careful with governance on those changes. There are plenty of examples on ethereum, where governance attack is used to drain the liquidity.

(re @TheRealErgoGod : *https://github.com/nightowlcasino/ERGOHACK-III-*) 
 
 It might also make sense to have small fee to discourage ddos attacks and arbitrage use. 

When you have more than one stable, they can be arbed via OWL.


[06/23/2022 7:25 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
(re @TheRealErgoGod : *there‚Äôs actually some info on that here!:*) 
 
 If you wanted, you could even aim for partly or fully independent system. Meaning no liquidity providers. 

For example,

If I put in 100 sigusd, then is that just sitting in the smart contract until someone takes it out? 

A part of that could be put into liq pools. (Sufficiently small and safe to ensure liquidity in case of a bank run). That part would generate yield. That yield could further be put to liq pools.

Assuming continuous usage, after some time, the cumulative interest would give deep protocol owned liquidity to your games.

This idea is similar to what I suggest here for sigusd:

 Definitely, our work into governance is only just beginning but this is something we need to consider.

 For sure, if necessary. When we support multiple stables arb is vital to consider. ddos perhaps a bit too, although mining fee (albeit tiny) is always present for that.

 Yeah you are right, the majority of the liquidity pool funds were to sit idle. There are of course risks to using the funds for liquidity provision elsewhere, but its a nice idea and one we will consider

 Yes. Might be unnecessary risk. If there are fees, then just those could be used.

It may dilute the investors ability to "be the house", but increases resiliency and liquidity. Not sure if that is worth it.

 You cant, it is just a sticker


[07/04/2022 2:35 AM] dann#0000
Starting to think we should not allow this sticker if it causes confusion


[07/04/2022 2:35 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
Oh ! so are we just waiting for Sep.?


[07/04/2022 2:36 AM] dann#0000
Correct, hopefully for September!

 You sound doubtful?

(re @SUPYOLLL : *You sound doubtful?*) 
 
 That is our target üòÅ


[07/04/2022 2:41 AM] dann#0000
Didnt mean to sound doubtful, probably because I am not a native english speaker I didnt see hopefully as a doubtful way of expressing myself


[07/04/2022 2:42 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
I've seen the AMAs and the way I understand it ,the roulette game should be ready by then , am I being too optimistic?


[07/04/2022 2:42 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000

(re @SUPYOLLL : *I've seen the AMAs and the way I understand it ,the roulette game should be ready by then , am I being too optimistic?*) 
 
 Roulette game could be declared as finished tbh, but we dont want to launch Night Owl simply with Roulette


[07/04/2022 2:45 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
Are you one of the guys that was speaking with CW?


[07/04/2022 2:46 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
(re @Daniumy : *Roulette game could be declared as finished tbh, but we dont want to launch Night Owl simply with Roulette*) 
 
 yes + we‚Äôre doing some internal testing then will prob open it up for public testing soon too


[07/04/2022 2:46 AM] dann#0000
Nope not me, I am a frontend dev, the guys who talked with CW were Supreme, Krasavice (backend devs) and J


[07/04/2022 2:48 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
right now we‚Äôre working on liquidity provisioning, testing roulette, need to finish lottery UI and that‚Äôs pretty much it


[07/04/2022 2:49 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
some other minor things as well but yea should be good for september for first version if all goes well w testing


[07/04/2022 2:50 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
(re @Daniumy : *Roulette game could be declared as finished tbh, but we dont want to launch Night Owl simply with Roulette*) 
 
 I used to work in casinos and cruiseships all over the  world and I can honestly say the roulette game is enough to launch. Apart from the USA (where Blackjack is more popular) and China(where Bacarat is more popular) roulette  is the most popular gambling game all over the world.


[07/04/2022 2:52 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
yes! i think roulette will be great. The other games don‚Äôt really require much UI work compared to UI so we decided to just lump them together with the release, since we were going to take roughly same amount of time regardless :)


[07/04/2022 2:52 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
if we see issues w some of the other games during testing we would for sure launch w just roulette until it‚Äôs all sorted out


[07/04/2022 2:52 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
but hopefully that doesn‚Äôt happen!


[07/04/2022 2:53 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
For me this project is a like a dream come true ,since I worked in casinos for more than 15 years ,am now studying programming and just got started dabbling in crypto


[07/04/2022 2:54 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
(re @SUPYOLLL : *For me this project is a like a dream come true ,since I worked in casinos for more than 15 years ,am now studying programming and just got started dabbling in crypto*) 
 
 ah that‚Äôs awesome! You could build your own game and list it on night owl


[07/04/2022 2:54 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
how‚Äôs your programming coming along ?


[07/04/2022 2:54 AM] dann#0000

 I think here in Spain it s very popular too


[07/04/2022 2:57 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
(re @TheRealErgoGod : *how‚Äôs your programming coming along ?*) 
 
 I've been studying Java , but I think it's not that much of a leap to Scala to Ergo-Scrypt , from what I understand


[07/04/2022 2:58 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
I would have to make sure that nobody owns the rights to it


[07/04/2022 3:00 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
(re @TheRealErgoGod : *ah that‚Äôs awesome! You could build your own game and list it on night owl*) 
 
 The way I understand it , we can bring our own games to the platform,but I think its up to the platform to make sure that nobody owns the rights to those games eg.three card poker .I was surprised to find out that there was a company that owned the rights  to that game.

 If you build it from the scratch then it‚Äôs yours I believe . You just change the name and maybe a rule and It‚Äôs a brand new game

 they can do nothing sir. what they are gonna sue you for? for creating a new card game


[07/04/2022 3:06 AM] koutelier#0000
you can't put super mario in the casino that's copyright . but you can make any card game

(re @SUPYOLLL : *I just figured we don't want to give any  government department an excuse to sniff into our dealings*) 
 
 if they are gonna do it they will do it for others reasons anyway

 Well they shouldn't do it by us infringing on patented property


[07/04/2022 3:09 AM] koutelier#0000
sir in order to sue you for copyrights you have to take the game with the exact form , the exact code and use it without permission . if you write the code and you change few things it's yours now . this is how coding works . you just don't call it three card poker


[07/04/2022 3:09 AM] koutelier#0000
you call it night card poker


[07/04/2022 3:11 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000

 If you knew anything about casino games you would know that is not how 'they' will take it.


[07/04/2022 3:11 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
'They'  make the rules as they go


[07/04/2022 3:11 AM] koutelier#0000
(re @SUPYOLLL : *If you knew anything about casino games you would know that is not how 'they' will take it.*) 
 
 and what "they" will do sir if they ever care? stop the blockchain from working ?


[07/04/2022 3:12 AM] koutelier#0000
they have no power over the blockchain


[07/04/2022 3:12 AM] koutelier#0000
i can clone the casino and play from my pc


[07/04/2022 3:12 AM] koutelier#0000
this is the fun stuff . if it's 100% decentralized they can't stop it


[07/04/2022 3:12 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
They can stop the onramping of fiat to crypto


[07/04/2022 3:12 AM] koutelier#0000
mixer


[07/04/2022 3:12 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
And you know they can


[07/04/2022 3:13 AM] koutelier#0000
you use mixer they can't track


[07/04/2022 3:13 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
It's got nothing to do with the blockchain


[07/04/2022 3:15 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
(re @SUPYOLLL : *It's got nothing to do with the blockchain*) 
 
 The biggest challenge we face in the crypto community is that almost all of the value we posess  or claim is derived from fiat  currency.


[07/04/2022 3:15 AM] koutelier#0000
ergo sir is POW


[07/04/2022 3:15 AM] koutelier#0000
that means i can mne it . that means i don't need fiat


[07/04/2022 3:15 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
It's still priced in USD


[07/04/2022 3:16 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
Even it's stablecoin is priced in USD


[07/04/2022 3:16 AM] koutelier#0000
yeah but i can use it regardless the price in usd . i can use erg . i can bet in the casino if the sc are deployed in the blockchain


[07/04/2022 3:16 AM] koutelier#0000
i can you mixer to withdraw the winnings


[07/04/2022 3:16 AM] koutelier#0000
and they can't do anything


[07/04/2022 3:16 AM] koutelier#0000
this is the magic of the blockchain


[07/04/2022 3:17 AM] koutelier#0000
it's priced not pegged


[07/04/2022 3:17 AM] koutelier#0000
i can price it to gold or other cryptocurrencies .


[07/04/2022 3:17 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
(re @koutelier : *i can you mixer to withdraw the winnings*) 
 
 Where will you withdraw if your government says you can't exchange crypto for fiat?


[07/04/2022 3:17 AM] koutelier#0000
so they casinos will force the governments ?


[07/04/2022 3:17 AM] koutelier#0000
sir what are you talking about ?


[07/04/2022 3:18 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
Let's start from the beginning


[07/04/2022 3:18 AM] koutelier#0000
also the whole mindset of cryptocurrencies is that one day you don't have to use fiat . you trade cryptos


[07/04/2022 3:18 AM] koutelier#0000
if you want to go that far


[07/04/2022 3:19 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
If you have crypto and your government says the crypto exchanges  are not allowed to exchange your crypto for fiat , what good will your crypto be?

(re @SUPYOLLL : *If you have crypto and your government says the crypto exchanges  are not allowed to exchange your crypto for fiat , what good will your crypto be?*) 
 
 how this is related to what we are talking about ?


[07/04/2022 3:20 AM] koutelier#0000
you are making scenarios that have nothing to do with what we are talking about.


[07/04/2022 3:21 AM] koutelier#0000
casinos don't have that powers sir. governments won't even care they will just put taxes or they won't allow cryptos for other reasons


[07/04/2022 3:21 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
(re @koutelier : *how this is related to what we are talking about ?*) 
 
 The fact whether you like it or not , that for crypto to be any use in the real world(buying food and paying for rent )


[07/04/2022 3:22 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
It has to be allowed by the government


[07/04/2022 3:22 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
As things stand


[07/04/2022 3:23 AM] koutelier#0000
and casinos will stop that because you created a card game ?


[07/04/2022 3:23 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
(re @koutelier : *casinos don't have that powers sir. governments won't even care they will just put taxes or they won't allow cryptos for other reasons*)

[07/04/2022 3:25 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
Are you still with me?


[07/04/2022 3:27 AM] koutelier#0000
sir you understand that first of all they literally can't sue you for creating a card game. they can sue you if you use their brand name . or the exact name of the game . and if they ever care about that there is literally nothing they can do to stop it .


[07/04/2022 3:27 AM] koutelier#0000
the scenarios you are talking are extreme and will never gonna happen . most likely if casinos see that dex casinos are moneymaking machines they will join the ride .


[07/04/2022 3:29 AM] koutelier#0000
you can't force government to shutdown cryptos because of one or thousand casinos


[07/04/2022 3:29 AM] koutelier#0000

[07/04/2022 3:31 AM] koutelier#0000
you have to understand how copyrights work sir , especially in gaming and coding .


[07/04/2022 3:33 AM] koutelier#0000
with your thinking if i code a social media platform facebook will come and sue me ?


[07/04/2022 3:39 AM] koutelier#0000
The biggest concern about night owl would be how to make available in most countries .because in most countries that have certain gambling laws the domain will be not accessible without vpn .


[07/04/2022 3:39 AM] koutelier#0000
have you thought about that @TheRealErgoGod ?


[07/04/2022 3:41 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
(re @koutelier : *have you thought about that @TheRealErgoGod ?*) 
 
 Flux and handshake can easily take care of that.

[07/04/2022 3:44 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
(re @koutelier : *what do you mean ?*) 
 
 Those are two projects and protocols that can take care of that problem, however my main concern is if someone who is not familiar to crypto and they just want to gamble (nothing else ) how do you onramp them?


[07/04/2022 3:44 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
Whether we like it or not we will have e to work with the go to

i don't know about usa but online gamlbing laws in most Europe are pretty strict


[07/04/2022 3:48 AM] koutelier#0000
so there will be definitely a problem. there isn't a way to add a vpn service in the front end right ?


[07/04/2022 3:53 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
Guys ,I'm not trying to be antagonistic for no reason,but we have to be realistic. The people that will be playing will have to exchange their fiat to crypto. And if we're just relying on crypto-savy people to play, then we will be running at a loss. Look anywhere in the world and surprisingly you will find that the biggest gamblers are the 50- 75 category.


[07/04/2022 3:55 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
yea, end goal is to get there. many steps to go

 sir if you come to play in a dex casino you already know how to swap. with bridges coming it will become easier and easier


[07/04/2022 3:56 AM] koutelier#0000
also ergodex will make a way to deposit fiat but not with ramps


[07/04/2022 3:56 AM] koutelier#0000
better

 target is ergo community->other chains ->regular people


[07/04/2022 3:57 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
but throughout the process, make it easier and easier to play


[07/04/2022 3:57 AM] koutelier#0000
yeah but until the last step are things that needs to be done that it's not in night owls hands


[07/04/2022 3:58 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
we can help and think of developing new technologies to see if possible to break barriers


[07/04/2022 3:58 AM] J - The Ergod#0000

when the rosen bridge is final here and ergo is spreading through other blockchains it will be really easy to trade other crtypto for erg


[07/04/2022 3:59 AM] koutelier#0000
other blockchains have already off ramp solutions


[07/04/2022 4:00 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
yea,  would be revolutionary though for someone to come up with a decentralized on-ramp , from fiat to crypto


[07/04/2022 4:00 AM] koutelier#0000
also p2p would be better


[07/04/2022 4:00 AM] koutelier#0000
if you want to keep the whole decentralized thing


[07/04/2022 4:01 AM] koutelier#0000
you send some fiat with paypal and you get erg or something


[07/04/2022 4:01 AM] koutelier#0000
binance used that


[07/04/2022 4:01 AM] koutelier#0000
off ramp and on ramp solutions need kyc and that sucks .. also they can do whatever they want with your money

 in some countries you don't but in most countries you need to , it would be interesting though if you added an on ramp solution and then right away you mix the erg


[07/04/2022 4:03 AM] koutelier#0000
so you know who i am but after that you complete lost my tracks .


[07/04/2022 4:03 AM] koutelier#0000
but mixing takes time and casinos must be fast


[07/04/2022 4:04 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
Are you guys not understanding what I'm saying? 
I am crypto -savy.
The other crypto-savy people that we are expecting to play on our platform do not fall into the demographics of people that spend alot of money and time in a casino.
We have to find a way to onboard the traditional gamblers (50 - 75 year olds)onto our platform ,since they have the most money to spend and the time to actually spend that money.
I hope I am making sense.

[07/04/2022 4:09 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
we haven‚Äôt even launched sir, we‚Äôre going to only get ergo community for a period of testing then target cardano, and think of ways to on-ramp people as easy as possible throughout the whole process


[07/04/2022 4:09 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
it‚Äôs continuous


[07/04/2022 4:10 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
but yea the target is online casino players market obv


[07/04/2022 4:11 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
we could easily compete with any big online casino because we have the distinct advantage of being able to provide funds and be the house


[07/04/2022 4:11 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
but yea goal is obv to make it super easy for a regular joe to go on our site and play


[07/04/2022 4:14 AM] SUPYOLLL#0000
I'm interested in providing funds for the pool , that's the reason I joined this group. 
What they didn't clarify in the AMA is , is it one pool per game or is it one pool for all the games?


[07/04/2022 4:25 AM] J - The Ergod#0000
one pool for all games for now

 yup! but since backend of liquidity provision is being built out simultaneously frontend for lottery will be able to be built out. i think likely when lp is finished well have roulette and lottery and maybe coin flip we‚Äôll see

"In addition, Night Owl third-party developers can benefit by using existing liquidity provider funds for their games, allowing for a quicker ramp-up and the utilization of OWL for their game currency."

Can liquidity providers opt out? Or are games checked before allowing liquidity use? Otherwise someone might drain existing liquidity with a bad game where the house loses in expectation.

 it uses ethereum hash for random number so ~15-20 seconds per spin (which is pretty similar to irl). the result is then transcribed into erg

(re @ahmmdu_Mod : *Min bet and max bet?*) 
 
 1.5% of total liquidity so if we have total liquidity for the house of 200k for example, max bet would be 3k per spin (assuming 1 to 1 payout like black or red, numbered bets would be less accordingly)

just as 'digital gold' became the triumphant narrative and use case for bitcoin in the last cycle

slowly and surely, the 'decentralized casino' thesis is emerging as the consensus narrative for crypto at large [filling the void left by 'web 3']

The Ethereum merge will fundamentally change crypto, forever

This may be explosive for other #PoW coins as $ETH miners move over their rigs

its all in one. why complicate it ?


[09/16/2022 4:31 PM] norluc#0000
All Im afraid is that the profitability from the casino alone doesnt become a strong incentive to provide liquidity in the long run


[09/16/2022 4:32 PM] norluc#0000
But I certainly didnt put as much thought in it as the team


[09/16/2022 4:32 PM] norluc#0000
Thats why Im asking


[09/16/2022 4:33 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
i see - honestly not really worried about the amount of liquidity we get. More worried about number of transactions for profitability, so for that we just need to make games that people will actually play + some good marketing pushes üòÅ

 Have u approached vcs?


[09/16/2022 4:34 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
however, casinos are very profitable. So, if we get people playing, returns should be worthwhile


[09/16/2022 4:34 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
(re @alohaaki : *Have u approached vcs?*) 
 
 no

(re @TheRealErgoGod : *no*) 
 
 Good


[09/16/2022 4:35 PM] norluc#0000
Specially considering that the profitability is not a constant function, its intuitive to me to have dynamic price "shares"


[09/16/2022 4:36 PM] norluc#0000
(re @norluc : *Specially considering that the profitability is not a constant function, its intuitive to me to have dynamic price "shares"*) 
 
 I mean open to market


[09/16/2022 4:36 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
what do you mean by that ?


[09/16/2022 4:37 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
dynamic price shares ?


[09/16/2022 4:37 PM] norluc#0000
I mean price subject to market


[09/16/2022 4:38 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
i disagree. The beauty of stable bets is that there‚Äôs no volatility. Bear or bull. As an investor you will make a return over time


[09/16/2022 4:38 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
doesn‚Äôt matter if the price of the token drops


[09/16/2022 4:38 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
not a speculative investment


[09/16/2022 4:38 PM] norluc#0000
Im not saying that the bets arent stable


[09/16/2022 4:39 PM] norluc#0000
Let me put a simple example


[09/16/2022 4:40 PM] norluc#0000
We have 10k usd liquidity at stage 0


[09/16/2022 4:40 PM] norluc#0000
In owl


[09/16/2022 4:40 PM] norluc#0000
People bet


[09/16/2022 4:41 PM] norluc#0000
And their really lucky even tho the expect value for investors was positive


[09/16/2022 4:41 PM] norluc#0000
*they're


[09/16/2022 4:41 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
there‚Äôs a dynamic max bet


[09/16/2022 4:41 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
1.5% of total liquidity


[09/16/2022 4:42 PM] norluc#0000
Is that 1.5% parameter subject to governance?


[09/16/2022 4:42 PM] NoahErgo#0000
(re @norluc : *Is that 1.5% parameter subject to governance?*) 
 
 Bad idea


[09/16/2022 4:43 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
it‚Äôs subject to only liquidity. so at 10k max bet is 150 for a 1:1 bet


[09/16/2022 4:43 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
at 50k it‚Äôs 750 for a 1:1 bet


[09/16/2022 4:44 PM] norluc#0000
I understand that, but I mean the factor. Are liquidity providers able to vote on changing it from 1.5% to 1% or 2%?


[09/16/2022 4:45 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Seems risky


[09/16/2022 4:45 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
no, that‚Äôs the number decided on as to protect the house


[09/16/2022 4:45 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Imo terrible to have this changeable


[09/16/2022 4:45 PM] norluc#0000
Hm


[09/16/2022 4:45 PM] norluc#0000
Do you think liquidity providers will be dumb and increase the risk?


[09/16/2022 4:46 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
i think it‚Äôs not worth putting into discussion as that was a mathematical calculation that was made in which the probability of making a run at the house becomes impossible


[09/16/2022 4:47 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
governance e should be more tied on game fees, new games, etc


[09/16/2022 4:47 PM] norluc#0000
I mean its always impossible if you consider one stream


[09/16/2022 4:48 PM] norluc#0000
Is that calculation available somewhere?


[09/16/2022 4:48 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
if they want to increase returns to house they can vote on increasing game fees at some point


[09/16/2022 4:49 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
i will dig it up - will be available in white paper though once we release


[09/16/2022 4:49 PM] norluc#0000
What if they want to be more conservative?


[09/16/2022 4:50 PM] norluc#0000
I mean my only fear is in the first stages


[09/16/2022 4:53 PM] norluc#0000
I didnt do the math, but it seems very high


[09/16/2022 4:53 PM] norluc#0000
Is it a normal value in the industry?


[09/16/2022 4:53 PM] norluc#0000
This 1.5% factor


[09/16/2022 4:55 PM] norluc#0000
Are this limits enforced through sequence betting?


[09/16/2022 4:57 PM] norluc#0000
So if 100 people are playing at the same time are they going to have their transactions failing because concurrent bets made the limits change?


[09/16/2022 4:58 PM] norluc#0000
Sorry for being annoying, just trying to understand fully how that is going to be done


[09/16/2022 4:59 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
no worries! i welcome the questions. i will get back to this though, g2g for now. be back soon


[09/16/2022 5:00 PM] norluc#0000
Thanks!


[09/16/2022 5:00 PM] NoahErgo#0000
(re @norluc : *What if they want to be more conservative?*) 
 
 This would be the only reasonable option


[09/16/2022 5:01 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Was concerned you wanted higher lol


[09/16/2022 5:03 PM] norluc#0000
It would be nice to have expected value for the profitability after n limit bets for multiple n values and different factors


[09/16/2022 10:16 PM] KrasaviceBlasen#0000
(re @norluc : *So if 100 people are playing at the same time are they going to have their transactions failing because concurrent bets made the limits change?*) 
 
 Yes, in most cases no transaction will be made though, they will not be permitted to go through


[09/16/2022 10:16 PM] KrasaviceBlasen#0000
(re @norluc : *I mean my only fear is in the first stages*) 
 
 Yeah, which is why it will be important to build strong initial liquidity

Heart 100% aus. I'm a realist though lol. Our form isn't great but I guess as everyone knows, down write us off. 

Be good to see NZ/IND final


[10/30/2022 2:06 AM] ThatOtherFella#0000
Yea betting with your heart can be dangerous. Very wise lol.
Coming in as an underdog can be good tho. And you never know about those Aussies üòâ.

Is there going to be a user pot balance, or will it currently run like Grand Gambit, which has to wait for confirmed tx before results?

(re  : *<HelixEvo> Is there going to be a user pot balance, or will it currently run like Grand Gambit, which has to wait for confirmed tx before results?*) 
 
 we use a different method for RNG which pulls drand.love and uses oracle. This will allow betting every ~30 seconds

(re @TheRealErgoGod : *@KrasaviceBlasen can go into detail but  you will be able to play every ~30 seconds but money wont be paid out until confirmed by Tx*) 
 
 Yes this is the way, what happens if say I have 2 Erg that I‚Äôve played and lost (now I have zero when the next transaction happens) but choose to play again straight away (cause technically I still have 2 Erg cause the transaction hasn‚Äôt hit yet?)

Would it be the win/loss wouldn‚Äôt register either way AFTER I hit play (and even get a result) (so I‚Äôm essentially just pressing a useless button?)
