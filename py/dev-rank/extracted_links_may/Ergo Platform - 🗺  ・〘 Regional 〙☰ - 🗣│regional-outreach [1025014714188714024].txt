Everyone - please add any regional admins to this chat if they‚Äôre not already here. 

Need to up our regional marketing game.

Currently linear marketing (stickers, flyers, etc) are the easiest to tackle. I will collect all resources best suited and make them available somewhere. 

We should make tailored marketing approaches for each region based on their needs & culture and then push local education and awareness campaigns to pull people in.

What else can we do? Is there anywhere I/the EF could help more?

Hey @farzamehsani quick question,
have you considered listing @Ergo_Platform yet?

I know you get daily listing requests, but if you want to learn more about our project, we #ergonauts would happily answer your questions!

Thanks for building the best exchange in Southern Africa.

        Aww yes!!! DM me addressed youd like them sent. And they will be on the way.

I will send you bulk, so if there are any other members in Australia you can distribute from your location too.


[04/16/2023 8:29 PM] CW#0000
Sweet. Happy to distribute down here üî•


[04/16/2023 8:34 PM] AustenMilbarge#0000
Also, I believe it was @dadreboi that suggested this, but the QR code is a service provided one. So when we get most of these stickers distributed and feel like they are being seen all over the world, we could update the QR code for a period time and run A contest or giveaway, like a scavenger hunt type deal. Scan QR code, enter giveaway with an ergo wallet address. Maybe figure out a way to see coolest place one of these stickers makes it to. Like it geo tags it or something.


Let‚Äôs see who can get one stuck in the White House. Or US capitol building. Lol.

[04/16/2023 9:31 PM] hq3r#0000
I have an idea but Dam it's to ambicious.... 15 diferent stickers with different qr , placed on big known cities and a treasure hunt website


[04/16/2023 9:31 PM] hq3r#0000
Every month u change the qr


[04/16/2023 9:35 PM] AustenMilbarge#0000
Lol. Most ambition.. maybe we start with just getting all stickers out and people putting them up. 

Then.. once we maybe get some people seeing them around we just try a ‚Äúfind a sticker, scan qr to enter‚Äù then it‚Äôs a raffle type deal. And we can make a webpage or something that geotags where the geotags of the origin of scan. And shows dots on a global map of all the locations peoples have found stickers. 

Disclaimer - don‚Äôt stick one in your house and scan it. Lol

More cexes also means splitting liquidity

Make sure to join your regional space #ergonauts! Europe/Asia are leading the way, but we have too many people from #pakistan, #turkey,  #arabic, #balkans, etc out in the cold. 

If your region is missing, or if you want to help spread ergo locally join

        There are thousands of coins not listed on Binance, if everyone is trying to promote their favorite coin on their channel‚Ä¶ it would be a mess. Even if it‚Äôs not positive for ergo, I can understand their policy. üòÖ
