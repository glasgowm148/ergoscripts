Hey @Stacie ! New channel here between you and the EF.


[12/02/2021 12:58 PM] glasgowm#9381
In terms of paying for stuff (subscriptions, twitter promotions). Are we on hold until we can get a bank account/card? Or could we use a preloaded card in the interim?


[12/02/2021 12:59 PM] Stacie#8189
Hey, @glasgowm. Thank you for creating this group. I will check with Alex and get back to you


[12/06/2021 10:27 AM] Stacie#8189
Hey @glasgowm. I have checked with Alex. He told that before for some subscriptions and tweet post he paid with his card, but then it became impossible to pay with Russian Card for foreign advertising.


[12/06/2021 10:27 AM] Stacie#8189
And we will have a permanent solution once we have our Bank account open


[12/06/2021 4:46 PM] Armeanio#0321
How close are we to getting a financial picture of the Ergo Foundations overall holdings?


[12/06/2021 4:46 PM] Armeanio#0321
As soon as we get the incorporation paperwork it will be needed to get clarity regarding banking.


[12/06/2021 4:47 PM] Armeanio#0321
Once the books are sorted would be possible to get a bimonthly report prior to EF meetings?


[12/06/2021 4:50 PM] Stacie#8189
We have already organised the Financial expenses for previous month; however, unfortunately, the date was not tracked, hence, it’s very difficult to reinstate. Plus I have requested books for previous months. Alex promised to send it.


[12/06/2021 4:50 PM] Stacie#8189
Sure, it’s a nice idea. So we will be all in the same page


[12/10/2021 8:29 AM] Stacie#8189
Hi!

@Armeanio#032, @glasgowm   , @Justin1000 and @kushti our Singapore Partners asked to arrange the call on the 15th Dec 2pm, SG date and time. Could you tell me please is it fine for everyone? Thank you

[12/10/2021 3:59 PM] Armeanio#0321
Sounds good to me


[12/15/2021 9:50 AM] Stacie#8189
Hi everyone 

Please find below some informant points which should be discussed on EF meeting or earlier if it’s needed:
1. Decide which tax system we will choose: Singapore Tax Resident or Singapore Tax Non-Resident;
2. Choose the Bank where we are going to open a Bank account;
3. Meeting with Cryptio.com representatives will be arrange to discuss further the the details of accounting - approximate date is 22nd of December 2021.

Thank you.


[12/15/2021 9:58 AM] Stacie#8189
I believe it would be nice to prepare the list of questions you would like to discuss on EF meeting. It will make it organised and structured. 

I will prepare the list. Please, send me to DM or here any topics or and questions you would like to discuss. 

I will conclude one day prior and share with EF here, hence, everyone will have a copy of it.

What do you think?


[12/15/2021 10:59 AM] glasgowm#9381
Please add it to the running EF agenda document pinned in #foundation


[12/15/2021 1:14 PM] Stacie#8189
Sure, @glasgowm, I will do it

[12/16/2021 5:40 AM] Justin1000#9555
@everyone Regarding tax jurisdiction of Singapore or leaving it ambiguous please read the notes above from my call with Dentons tax partner in late August. Guess is self explanatory. Not clearcut but probably better to file in Singapore to avoid ambiguity given there the EF should have minimal to no taxes due anyway.

[12/16/2021 6:05 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Stacie Guess you can take lead on filling this out. I think when it is done, then the Foundation legally has assets. Ideally should be signed by @morphic @kushti @catena (Dmitry Meshkov).


[12/16/2021 7:41 AM] Stacie#8189
Hi Justin, sure, I will fill it out.


[12/16/2021 12:55 PM] Stacie#8189
The points have been added to the Agenda


[12/16/2021 1:55 PM] Stacie#8189
And I have a question: do we have a digital place where we keep all documentation related to Ergo foundation LTd or it should be created?


[12/16/2021 2:16 PM] glasgowm#9381
Don't have one yet - should probably be linked on Notion once we have premium and can hide stuff based on permissions


[12/16/2021 2:18 PM] Stacie#8189
That’s great. For now I will keep on my Desktop that documentation. 

Meantime, I can place on Google Disk if it’s needed. 

Please, let me know once we are ready to link it on Notion.


[12/16/2021 3:31 PM] Stacie#8189
@Justin1000 I have some questions regarding filling out the document:
1. Dmitry Meshkov and Aleksandr Slesarenko are not mentioned in the Directors list. Shall I mention them anyway, otherwise, their names are not listed at the Ergo Foundation LTD, however, we are putting them at the Deed of Confirmation.
2. Only common wallet for Ergo Foundation LTD should be written there or individual wallet addresses too?
3. And there are some questions to Dentons in the end of the document. Do we have answers on that?

Thank you


[12/17/2021 1:47 PM] Stacie#8189
@Justin, I have prepared the document and will sign it with Alex. However, I believe that the account in Gate.io is supposed to be put in there. Am I right? As of now, I have put a Common Wallet in Yoroi. Please, advise on that.

And another question: who is supposed to be witness? Lawyer, notary or anyone else?

[12/17/2021 1:48 PM] Stacie#8189
Hi Everyone.

I am verifying an account for ERGO FOUNDATION LTD on Gate.io and to submit KYC verification as a company, I have to prepare and upload some documents.

One of them is the Board of Members Consent about opening an account on Gate.io.

Kindly sign the document below, so I can submit the verification.

Please, advise how it will be convenient to do so as there are 6 signatures required. There are several options:

1. You can sign, scan and send it here back one by one in order to mentioned names in the document;
2. You can send me in DM your e-signatures and I can put it to the document and send it back as a final version here once it’s done.
3. I have placed the document in Google disk and you can find the link here, so you can e-sign it there:

https://docs.google.com/file/d/1OkZztIDPrPYxKLmVX4xEIJesC4nr155W/edit?usp=docslist_api&filetype=msword

Let me know, please, what is the best option for you or there is an alternative way.

I count on your prompt cooperation in order to complete the verification as soon as possible.

Thank you

I tried sending a request for signature through Adobe to Ching, @kushti , @Armeanio, @glasgowm, @Noah ~ 贺能 . probably they can just sign it easily there via email. (shouldn't need adobe)


[12/17/2021 3:25 PM] Stacie#8189
Okay, I will do in the same way. Let me try


[12/17/2021 3:27 PM] Justin1000#9555
I think requires a subscription for sender. I got the adobe acrobat DC subscription. seems to work well for stuff like this.


[12/17/2021 3:28 PM] Stacie#8189
Thank you, @Justin1000, I will search about it


[12/17/2021 4:43 PM] Stacie#8189

Also, I have filled out the Deed of Confirmation and added the wallet address in Gate.io (I have gotten it by choosing the deposit ERGO token option).

However, one question is still pending: who is the witness supposed to be? Notary?

She seems to say its ready now. You can login and check. I can't because don't have access to email. If not ready let me know. It should be VIP level 12 for free first month.

@Armeanio, @Justin1000, @kushti, @glasgowm, @Noah ~ 贺能  our Singapore Partners asked to arrange the call on the 23rd Dec 11 am, SG date and time. Could you tell me please is it fine for everyone? Or we should reschedule it to 2 pm Singapore time if they can as it can be tight for Mark and Alex. 

Thank you


[12/22/2021 10:02 AM] Justin1000#9555
Its okay with me. But I would be more keen to know what the Denton's tax partner thinks. I sent him an email and cc'd you.


[12/22/2021 10:29 AM] Justin1000#9555
Looks pretty good. Probably you should add a "CONFIDENTIAL" watermark somewhere on every page. Doesnt have to be huge but clearly visible


[12/22/2021 10:53 AM] Stacie#8189

[12/22/2021 5:22 PM] Stacie#8189
You are right. The salary of the Development team has mixed up with the Salary of EF. Changed.

Seems like good prospect that Wise might work for account first and then get a comprehensive full service bank account when can meet the minimum balance requirements. IF Wise is offering enough to satisfy things like apple store etc.

I am fooling out the application to a Bank Frick (Switzerland) and I need to put the information for Board of Directors and it requires on this step to have Tax IDs and dates of birth of each member. 

What do you think shall I continue and collect this information or on this step they are asking too much?


[12/23/2021 7:40 PM] Armeanio#0321
We will need this information gathered anyway for most large exchanges.

Hi everyone.

@Noah ~ 贺能, @Justin1000, @Armeanio, @glasgowm, @kushti 

Please, be informed that the Ledger for Singapore is ready. Only 2 transactions are supposed to be clarified with Alex as it might be done from a different wallet and I couldn’t find out the proof of transaction on ERGO explorer.

The Ledger and proof are saved on the Google disk. Please, find the link below:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/124Xo7GbQFLhKzy_s5AnOvoj7O8FrLbY1

If there are any comments, please, let me know.

Thank you.


[01/03/2022 6:55 AM] Justin1000#9555
*Yes, need it signed by Dmitry, Alex and Alex because they were all holders of private key to the original treasury and probably also had biggest early contributions to github that designed the treasury mechanism. Anyway that was what Dentons requested. For Dmitry and Alex, if they don't have any wallets outside the multi-sig treasury they can just sign for that. The other yoroi and exchange wallets may need to be signed by Kushti if he controls though.


[01/03/2022 6:55 AM] Justin1000#9555
*Per response by Denton's on Dec 22 "No need for notary. " -> implies anyone can be witness.


[01/03/2022 7:10 AM] Stacie#8189
Sure, @Justin1000, no problem. I will amend the form and send it to Alex again. 

And sign from my side as witness as I am the one who sends documents on DocuSign.

Thank you

Hi @Stacie 

Eva (China community)'s monthly compensation is US$1,800 fixed plus discretional bonus of up to 100 Ergs. To be paid at the beginning of each month. USD/ERG rate is the rate as of about 12:00 noon time (Beijing time zone) on the 1st of each month.


[01/04/2022 12:23 AM] Noah ~ 贺能#5674
For Jan 2022, at your earliest convenience please send to Eva:
USD1,800 / 4.864 = 370 Ergs + 100  Ergs bonus = total 470 Ergs
Please send to Eva's address:

Full discretional 100 Ergs since Eva did a lot of extra work and took the lead on a lot of things for contacting miners and coordination in regards to the soft fork.

@Stacie Lets be cautious with how we deal with Ching and Le Yu. I see they are asking a bunch of questions about "missing" transactions. They will be really concerned on ongoing basis about compliance and reporting so lets try and get everything sorted to max degree possible on our end before raising issues with them. You didn't do anything wrong of course but something to keep in mind going forward.


[01/06/2022 6:37 AM] Justin1000#9555
It occurs to me if helpful, it MIGHT be possible to start financial reporting from the date the Deed of Confirmation is completed if you think we need more time. I could call le Yu and ask them if you want. But probably ideally it would be best to start reporting with Jan 1 this year or as of incorporation.


[01/06/2022 6:38 AM] Justin1000#9555
In any case we do need to get the Deed of Confirmation's done as some assets and accounts are not in name of Foundation yet. Actually you may also consider opening accounts at all exchanges in the Foundation's name as well although I dont think we can expect you to complete this ASAP given all the other tasks...just when you have time.


[01/06/2022 7:38 AM] Stacie#8189
@Justin1000, thank you for your message. 

I understand your point and will not send to Mr. Ching uncomplicated documents. My thought there was that we cannot keep them without updates for a long, otherwise, they will be still concerned about the reason why we were not able to fo it faster. 

And the reason why these details are missing for now is simple: some transactions are paid by Alex himself from different wallets and I do not have access to these wallets or other information like all all wallets of the team with names: now in Yoroi transactions have same amount, but different wallets and I am not able to identify to whom it belongs.

About Deed of Confirmation. If I understood correctly, there we should put all wallets opened on foundation name only, right? In this case I believe as of now it is only in Gate.io. Please, correct me if I am wrong. However, actually  Deed Of Confirmation now has 2 wallets: Gate.io and Yoroi wallet. Additionally, if we are going to open any new wallet, do we need to create a new Deed of Confirmation or it will be another document?

Regarding the starting day, I believe that the report should start from the announcement of the incorporation - 9th of December 2021 as otherwise, it would be wrong as treasury was actually spent.

I will do my best to complete everything by today with the information what I have.

Thank you.


[01/07/2022 6:03 AM] Justin1000#9555
In my opinion, we just need those initial 3 Deeds signed by Kushti, Alex, Dmitry. They should include all the assets and personal wallets and accounts where Foundation assets are held. Then after that, I think it will be sufficient to carefully track assets and not necessary to sign any additional “transfer” deeds. Denton’s would know best but they are slow to respond to any questions so recommend the above.

Over time we should move away from using accounts opened in personal names and get accounts opened in Foundaton’s name wherever needed. but I don’t think this is the most urgent task as have a lot of other things to do.

I note there was a 71k ERG buy order on Gate.io during last 24 hours. Good to get the Gate account in Kairon’s hands soon so they can better market-make. Also, @kushti please note. 

Also, note the email exchange with Equity Bank / Liongate. We probably need to discuss amongst the broader team but I think we can go with them for opening a bank account (Equity Bank) and a crypto custody account (Liongate). By keeping USDT and possibly Bitcoin there, we might also be able to avoid too many troublesome multi-sig arrangements for different crypto and will be easy to convert to Fiat on demand.


[01/07/2022 6:25 AM] Stacie#8189
I have prepared new Deed of Confirmation.

Here is the link:

https://docs.google.com/file/d/1Q9L4vX_xdHxscyX2ZqXaDMGHhsElObC3/edit?usp=docslist_api&filetype=msword

I have texted Alex Slesarenko and requested to provide the information about his passport number and wallets. Plus I have asked how I can find Dmitry.

If you have any ideas, please, give me a hint. 

Thank you

Please, kindly have a look and give your feedback if any changes/additions should be added.

Thank you

[01/10/2022 3:52 PM] Stacie#8189
Likewise, there are some engagements letters from Singapore’s colleagues:
1. Engagement Letter about Accounting Services where they are suggesting a company who we provide our accounting books and they are uploading it to Xero. However, here I would like to propose to change the engagement letter from providing accounting services to consulting ones. As I would prefer to upload all accounting information by myself to Xero and they will be reviewing and providing audit.
2. Engagement letter about Audit - Definitely should be signed as no one from us have a strong knowledge about Accounting system in Singapore as of now. 
3. Engagement letter for GST completion - Definitely should sign. 
4. Engagement letter for other taxes - should be signed.

Engagement letters (3) and (4) - I would like to be involved in the preparation of taxes as I want to know how to do it so in the future we can independent in this question and do not spend a lot on third party services. 

Please, share your ideas and thoughts.

Thank you

@Justin1000, I would like to reconfirm if it is needed to include Alex Slesarenko and Dmitry Meshov to Deed of Confirmation as their names are not included in the official list of Members and I think it might raise some questions about them from our partners in Singapore like if they have an impact on EF why they are not included to the Board of Members and so on. 

What do you think?


[01/15/2022 10:55 AM] Justin1000#9555
For auditors, I think we need for fiscal year ended Dec 31, 2022 (not 2021)


[01/15/2022 12:37 PM] Stacie#8189
I think it’s better to check with Mr. Ching


[01/15/2022 12:37 PM] Stacie#8189
I will send message to him


[01/15/2022 1:57 PM] Justin1000#9555
Believe they said on the call we just need reports starting end of this year. We certainly would want to strongly avoid incurring cost and time of doing any reports just for final month of 2021.


[01/15/2022 2:06 PM] Justin1000#9555
Hard to say. Dentons recommended we get it signed by all 3 but Dentons is slow to even respond to our emails. When I spoke to them about it months ago sounded like it was more of a best practice than something clearly absolutely necessary.


[01/15/2022 2:18 PM] Stacie#8189
Okay, maybe we can try with Alex Chepurnoi and Alex Slesarenko and I believe it will be enough


[01/15/2022 2:21 PM] Stacie#8189
Honestly, I believe it would be better to double check this with Mr. Ching as for me it seemed weird if the company incorporated in the beginning of December, however, financial transactions started from 2022 only. 

However, I am not insisting, just discussing.

Thank you


[01/15/2022 3:53 PM] Justin1000#9555
I think he said the first financial period would cover the period from incorporation. So if you incorporate in Nov or Dec the first financial period include the entire first 13-14 months but no need to rush out any reports for the first month or two.


[01/15/2022 3:56 PM] Stacie#8189
Okay, got it. Let’s just double check on that


[01/15/2022 6:35 PM] Stacie#8189

Please, find my points below and what I was working on:

3. Financial Analysis for 2 weeks of January 2022 is ready.
4. Budgeting is on going. Will share once it is ready. First - for 1 year and then for 3 years horizon which will he revised every month. Plus monthly comparison how accurate our forecast was and corrections 
5. Project updates. Today I have sent the type form to the teams. Weekly we have between 4 and 6 teams who share updates via Type form + ErgoPad want to be included to ErgoPulse + Review of ErgoDex Business plan 
6. Deed of Confirmation will be added by today and submitted for signature. Alex Slesarenko and Alex Chepurnoi only. 
7. Gate.io verification has been approved. We need to set Google authentication, hardware security key and sms setup

Hi everyone.

@glasgowm, @Armeanio, @Justin1000, @Noah ~ 贺能, @kushti, @morphic

Please, find below approximate budget for 2022. 

- Lines highlighted blue are expenses in ERGO, hence, the total amount will depend on the market price of ERG token.

- Joseph has suggested to consider different price models. I would like to consider 3 different scenarios:
   a) the most likely or realistic;
   b) optimistic;
   c) pessimistic.

Please, share your thoughts.

Once we finalise with Budget on 2022, I will prepare budget for 2023 and 2024.

Thank you

For Development budget, can we have an estimation of it's breakdown and why 27000 ERGs will be enough, considering out current/planned expenses?


[01/20/2022 4:45 PM] Stacie#8189
Hi @morphic, 

Thank you for your feedback. I will definitely give an explanation of the logic which has been used, however, I will give it by Monday-Tuesday next week as I don’t have my laptop for now. 

However, Development expenses for December 2021 are approximately the same as forecast plus in forecast I have put some increment every quarter as ERGO is growing. 

Thank you


[01/20/2022 4:46 PM] Stacie#8189
And the forest has been built only based on one month - December 2021 as only from December 2021 we have recording of expenses.


[01/20/2022 4:53 PM] morphic#4133
Monday-Tuesday is ok. From January 2022 I will also start recording timesheet for my development job, which I didn't before. You can add expenses similar to that of Benjamin to the budget.
Talking about Benjamin, as far as I remember he will start working full time from January (if I remember it right) and his compensation will increase comparing to December.


[01/20/2022 4:57 PM] Stacie#8189
Yes, I have calculated the budget including increased costs for Benjamin’s work and I will review the budget and put expenses for you development job.

Thank you for highlights.


[01/21/2022 10:49 AM] Stacie#8189
Hi everyone,

@morphic, @Justin1000, @glasgowm, @Armeanio, @kushti

Any thoughts on that so I can reply to Mr. Ching?

Thank you


[01/21/2022 3:02 PM] Justin1000#9555
I think my only comment was above on Auditor - "that we audit the financial statements of the Company which comprise the
statement of financial position as at 31 December 2021 and the statement of profit or loss and other
comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the financial
year then ended" -> this should be 31 December 2022 (the "financial year" will include the rump period in 2021 so no need to do 2 financial statements or pay them 2x)


[01/21/2022 3:03 PM] Justin1000#9555
Besides that, in general we probably need to start seeing where can save money and pay stuff later where possible. Probably we will need to pay closer attention to financial planning now. ERG price is really low and market is also bad in general...


[01/21/2022 4:04 PM] glasgowm#9381
Looked okay to me but not really sure how to evaluate it


[01/21/2022 4:05 PM] glasgowm#9381
Could you add commitment in USD to this (ie, what needs to be paid in fiat/USDT rather than ERG)


[01/21/2022 5:12 PM] Stacie#8189
All budgeting part is in USD as I thought it is much easier to understand and compare


[01/25/2022 6:01 AM] Stacie#8189
Payments in ERG have been highlighted, the rest - USD/USDT


[01/25/2022 6:05 AM] Stacie#8189
Hi everyone

Please, find below detailed salary expenses below. Without Alex Slesarenko it was ERG25,789. After it became - ERG29,289.

[01/25/2022 6:01 PM] Stacie#8189
It is normally twice per month; however, I believe the dates here are not so important as we need to find only total number to plan.

In order to open Bank account we need to provide some information about directors and board members. Hence, please submitted as soon as possible:
- certified, signed, legible, valid copy of passport 
- recent (within 3 months) original or certified copies of proof of address.

Thank you


[01/29/2022 10:36 AM] Justin1000#9555
I sent you mine in DM in discord. But I do not have a certified true copy within 3 months, just the last one from when we set up the entity but I did in September so about 4 months.

It’s a big hassle to get Certified True Copies as we all discovered when setting up entity. Maybe Equity Bank/Lion Gate can accept a Certified True Copy from ~4 months ago. And if needed we can send a non-certified copy that will show same info but within 3 months. (so I sent you a more recent bank statement too…) 

If they don’t accept that, to get Certified true copies will be big hassle for everyone and lead to a significant delay.

Thank you, @Justin1000, for your reply. 

I will speak to them and get back to you. For now - thank you for sending what you have right now.

Hi everyone,

Kindly be informed that I have prepared the documents for a Bank Account opening.

Please, have a look and let me know if any changes should be applied. You can find the documents here:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YwkCMcpbt8ayb3H78YDsORitbaJFwSSi

Additionally, I have sent an email to Equity Bank of Bahamas to clarify:
1. The validity of proof of address - if it can be extended.
2. I have drafted the Resolution of Board of Directors regarding Bank Account opening. Once it is confirmed from Equity Bank of Bahamas side, I will send you all to sign it.

@Noah ~ 贺能, please send to me in DM certified passport copy and a proof of address in order to complete the set. 

@Armeanio, please fill out some additional documents as you are an American citizen:
1. Declaration of status for US Tax Purpose Form;
2. W-9 Tax Form

Thank you.


[02/01/2022 12:18 PM] glasgowm#9381
It seems for everyone but Justin it's only the certified passport that's in the folder. Do you need us to resend the old one through? But yeah same issue, 9th of October mine was done so ~4mo. But just a day-trip for me so let me know if you need a fresh one.

Likewise, please find the comparison of Budget and Actual for January 2022.

Please, be informed that the difference in salary for Developers will be significant (saved a lot). It occurred due to:
1. Alex’s Slesarenko Salary has not been approved yet, hence, it was not actually paid;
2. Monye David’s salary has not been approved yet;
3. Salary for Amitabah, Ilya, Greenhat has been considered as it is paid in ERG, however, actually it was paid in USDT. 

However, my suggestion is to keep budget for Development on the level where it is set up now as the situation can be changed any minute and we can bring on board new mining power or other developers.

You should be able to see full Discord analytics now and I can send you Reddit ones if you send me your username. Unique Users is probably a more useful metric than subscribers. # of devs is off it should be 246. This was a mistake in the excel sheet calculation which has been fixed.


[02/08/2022 12:49 PM] glasgowm#9381
It would be good to have the Foundation holdings in this sheet taking into account the burn rate. Then on the tabs different price scenarios. We need to forecast a bear (~0.10-40c) and bull scenario and ensure we're covered for all our USD commitments for ~2 years. 

Should probably be DCAing out via MMs regardless of price to build that reserve (and maybe putting some of it to use in stuff like ERG/SigUSD pool)


[02/08/2022 12:53 PM] Stacie#8189
I will change the Statistics and send the report back.

My user ID on Discord is Stacie#8189


[02/08/2022 12:57 PM] Stacie#8189
It’s a good idea to put holdings and understand for how long treasury will be enough to cover expenses. 

And for sure we can consider different scenarios of the price, however, for this month the price forecast was pretty accurate.


[02/08/2022 12:59 PM] Stacie#8189
And may you please advise where I can find this Statistics?

Hi everyone.

The results of our meeting with Dentons:
1. There ate chances to get COR for ERGO Foundation LTd;
2. For now there is no urgent need to get it done. However, I e should consider it for the nearest future as it will be a protection from double taxes and brings us treaty benefits.

And if we want to have it in 2023 we should think about it in 2022 and we can apply from October 2022 for 1 year in advance.

Let’s keep it in mind and get back to this question in 2 months.


[02/09/2022 9:14 AM] Stacie#8189
Likewise, I have prepared analysis of the price year to year and all years together to predict the price and understand the dynamic.

Conclusions:
1. ERGO has potential to grow in 2022 and it is shown in Exponential indicator (it is more that 1) and dynamic is positive.
2. It might be some dropping down in the nearest month, after all it should be stabilised and change to growing.

I have sent an account opening application. Please, sign it as soon as possible.

Thank you


[02/10/2022 8:17 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think the source of funds should be changed to the Ergo Foundation with ergo Foundation address. Using Kushti's name and address could potentially raise a lot questions. Also all assets belong and are controlled by Foundation. Kushti is just executing transactions on behalf of Foundation. 

After name and address there you could also put in parens "(account to be funded by liquidation of Ergo Foundation crypto assets custodied with Liongate after account set up)" - we will fund the bank account this way and not via bank transfer


[02/10/2022 8:26 AM] Stacie#8189
Thank you, @Justin1000, noted. I will change


[02/12/2022 5:26 AM] Stacie#8189

Looks fine to me.
Morise PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ACCOUNTING SERVICES TO ERGO FOUNDATION LTD, only thing I suggest is to remove "You shall indemnify us" and replace with just "You shall hold us harmless". As I understand, if we agree to indemnify Morise,  we are agreeing to be fully liable if some 3rd party sued Morise. Not reasonable. Also AssentSure does not have such clause.

[03/02/2022 8:16 PM] Armeanio#0321
So the credit score?


[03/02/2022 11:32 PM] glasgowm#9381
Bank reference is a letter confirming you can meet a financial commitment usually - but not sure what commitment we're making here that requires credit?


[03/03/2022 6:53 AM] Stacie#8189
I believe they just want to understand that all members of the company are trustworthy


[03/03/2022 6:53 AM] Stacie#8189
For me it’s a little bit too much


[03/03/2022 7:56 AM] Justin1000#9555
Got one of those before from my bank. Think is just basic letter saying you have account in good standing or something. Anyway painful but just spent an hour on phone with my bank and seems I can get one couriered to here by about one week from now. So I will send a scanned copy through when I have it. But note they probably don't even need one from me as I have an account with Equity Bank already!


[03/03/2022 7:56 AM] Justin1000#9555
I guess Character reference letter should be no problem although annoying.

Looks like the community-dev field was over-written on the spreadsheet, i've fixed it now. 

Not sure how useful growth as a metric is for Discord due to the amount of spam accounts that flood the server and then either get removed or muted.  Maybe message activity is a better metric

I agree with you, Mark, but spam or not spam all subscribers are our audience and it is supposed to be displayed. If we could segregate there spam users and healthy ones, would be good. What do you think is it possible? And I have added message activity to the report. It’s a good idea

@everyone 

Kindly be informed that I had a meeting yesterday with Nikita Nikiforov - VP Business Development from Ezil.

We gave some ideas regarding alternative options for the Bank account opening:
1. Bahrain. They are very flexible with documents, limits and procedures. Everything goes through exchange. However, there is one drawback - the company is supposed to be incorporated in one of Gulf Countries: the UAE, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, for example. 

We can consider it for the future if we would like to incorporate the profit company as there is no income tax in Free Zone where Dubai is included, for instance.

2. Dominica or Switzerland. Ezil works with them and Nikita will ask them if they can help and share the contacts.

Additionally be informed that they would like to do some projects with Ergo and mine Ergo.

I will keep you posted.

`the complaint is supposed to be incorporated in one of Gulf Countries: the UAE, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, for example. `

Not sure what this means - Do you mean 'The company should not be incorporated in one of the Gulf Countries' ?

Hi @everyone,

Due to a long time KYC-verification process, we wanted to consider some alternative options. The one I am working on now is Migom Bank which has placed on Dominica.

I have communicated with their representatives and got the information about the Bank and needful documents to pass KYC-verification.

The information about the Bank itself and services you can find by following the link below:

bit.ly/MigomBank-drive

I filled out the documents for KYC-verification and will be needing your support in terms of signing documents. I will be initiating it shortly and you will receive an email about it. It would be highly appreciated if you can sign it as soon as possible.

You feedback will be more than welcome too.

Thank you

Bank account rejected 😭 could they not have told us this months ago?


[05/31/2022 6:30 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah. Despicable. Suppose we must find an alternative now. Just any bank that can fill the role. Probably won't be near as good and won't have crypto custody though :(


[06/01/2022 6:33 AM] Noah ~ 贺能#5674
@Stacie Hi Stacie,

please send monthly salary to Eva:
USD1,800 / 2.63 = 684 Ergs + 55 Ergs bonus = total 739 Ergs

Please send to Eva's same address, thanks:

[06/01/2022 1:10 PM] Justin1000#9555
Regarding bank account, the only ideas I have from my end at this point are:
1 – Consultant: I can check with that consultant I mentioned a long time ago. He is the guy that introduced me to Equity Bank years ago. He may be able to find us a bank for a fee.
2 – Ergodex: Yasha is checking to see if his lawyer has any suggestions. They still haven’t opened an account though so not sure will be much help.
3 – Le Yu: Can check again with Le Yu. Don’t recall how we left that but feel like they didn’t seem very confident given our low balance and that was before the sanction issue.


[06/10/2022 2:04 PM] Stacie#8189
Hi everyone,

Please, find below the Financial Report for May 2022.

[06/10/2022 2:09 PM] Stacie#8189
And I have updated Budget VS Actual. Please have a look.

However, there is no payments for Nairobi and Jense there. @kushti, please, update if the payments have been completed or not yet. If it was done, please advise what is the amount and when was it paid. 

Thank you

[06/12/2022 6:04 PM] morphic#4133
@Stacie, does EF have verified business/corporate account on any of the crypto exchanges?


[06/12/2022 6:12 PM] Stacie#8189
Not yet, @morphic. But we can already send international transfers, however, IBAN is under process


[06/12/2022 6:17 PM] morphic#4133
You mean SWIFT transfers?


[06/12/2022 6:19 PM] Stacie#8189
Yes, we can do Swift transfers, but we do not have INAN number


[06/12/2022 6:19 PM] Stacie#8189
That’s the reason, I haven’t shared yet the news


[06/12/2022 6:20 PM] morphic#4133
from which account?


[06/12/2022 6:20 PM] Stacie#8189
And one more thing - I will order a virtual debit card


[06/12/2022 6:21 PM] Stacie#8189
I was working on Corporate account with Global Unit Pay


[06/12/2022 6:21 PM] Stacie#8189
And they approved it


[06/12/2022 6:21 PM] morphic#4133
Oh, that is something I've been waiting for


[06/12/2022 6:23 PM] Stacie#8189
However, for now they are working on implementation of IBAN creation system, but it has not finished yet


[06/12/2022 6:23 PM] Stacie#8189
I will keep you posted


[06/12/2022 6:26 PM] morphic#4133
IBAN is necessary for receiving fiat, right?


[06/12/2022 6:27 PM] morphic#4133
It is not necessary for payments


[06/12/2022 6:27 PM] Stacie#8189
Yes


[06/12/2022 6:27 PM] Stacie#8189
We can make payments now


[06/12/2022 6:27 PM] Stacie#8189
And we should try how it works


[06/12/2022 6:27 PM] morphic#4133
so, I can send you invoice, and you can pay it from corporate EF account


[06/12/2022 6:28 PM] Stacie#8189
Yeah


[06/12/2022 6:28 PM] Stacie#8189
We can try how it goes


[06/12/2022 6:28 PM] morphic#4133

[06/12/2022 6:28 PM] Stacie#8189
Sure


[06/12/2022 6:29 PM] Stacie#8189
I have some technical issues with two-factor authentication. But should be solved soon


[06/12/2022 6:29 PM] Stacie#8189

What is the USDT outgoing and do you have it with list of items? I believe in the budget its accounted for already but converted to ERG value, right?


[07/02/2022 6:09 AM] Justin1000#9555

Let me know if anything else is needed


[07/11/2022 11:16 PM] kushti#0978
@everyone Noticed that @Stacie sold 3K ERGs on KuCoin to compensate for USD sent to greenhat, instead of asking for USDT we have. I thought we've decided to keep ERGs intact for now ?


[07/12/2022 3:37 AM] Justin1000#9555
Not sure we addressed specifically issue of selling ERGs to pay salaries. I didn't even know we were doing that.

But anyway yeah I don't think we should right now assuming the USDT balance is above say $100k. We should be conserving ERGs for longer term.


[07/12/2022 3:38 AM] Justin1000#9555
So I would suggest just using USD balance on hand for those payments for now. Hopefully get some major relief on ERG price in late July/August or September latest.


[07/12/2022 10:13 AM] Stacie#8189
Noted, will inform next month to send USDT to convert to USD for GreenHat. 

Thank you for letting me know


[07/12/2022 11:50 AM] Stacie#8189
Hi Everyone,

Sorry for the delay. I was waiting for the Statistics of Marketing channels. Reddit and Discord is not up to date still, unfortunately. However, it was way to long to wait further.

Did we not use the last of our USDT paying huobi? I don't think Stacie should be selling at all, ideally pay who we can in ERG and otherwise pay from a USDT pot that Kairon keeps funded by cashing out erg passively.

The best option for minimizing price impact on ERG is coinex swap. 

Swap erg to another cryptocurrency.
Transfer that and sell it to usd.

[07/18/2022 4:30 PM] kushti#0978
In short, no changes for us probably, FL 331 is extending  FL 259 in regards with new sections buzz is coming about, and I do not see how crossborder payments are in FL 259 scope. In general, EF is not solving compliance and taxation problems for any jurisdiction, as we have a lot of them, with a lot of specific details for every jurisdiction.


[07/18/2022 4:39 PM] glasgowm#9381
I see, thanks. The translated excerpt makes it seem like a blanket ban on Russians recieving crypto as payment for services so I don't want to put anyone at risk as the community will inevitably ask.

[08/20/2022 10:59 AM] Stacie#8189
Hi @everyone. Kindly share your opinion on the questions: which currency exchange rate should be used when we are reimbursing the payments done on the behalf of EF? If ERG got sold for the payment shall we reimburse the amount of ERG sold to get fiat or actual payment in fiat should be exchanged to ERG at the day of reimbursement? Or shall we think about a different way to get USDT, for example, for the payments and do not sell ERG?

What do you think?


[08/20/2022 11:10 AM] glasgowm#9381
context: I need to cash out erg to pay the quoted subscriptions - and have ended up with less erg due to price bump. We should be paying people at the time of invoice (for people reclaiming erg spent anyway)


[08/20/2022 3:10 PM] morphic#4133
If we have due payment on some date, we can use Open Price of that day on coingecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ergo/historical_data) for conversion between ERG and USD in both directions.
For payments in USDT EF should have USDT reserve which is replenished monthly by scheduled ERGs liquidations. And then USDT payments are always done from the reserve.
Depending on the ERG's market price we can either liquidate more (to increase the reserve) of liquidate less (to save ERGs). This should be part of monthly budget planning and execution. 
Every month Stacie can come up with motivated proposal for amount of ERGs to be liquidated, then after approval she can execute the liquidation using whichever method is most appropriate (grid bot on exchange, market maker's service, regular manual orders on exchange)

I am withdrawing from fmfw atm, so no need for cosig


[08/21/2022 11:07 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think it would be good to add a balance sheet page to the monthly report. Could  include the USDT balance (after taking out any of Kushti's personal funds from calculation of course), BTC balance, ERG balance, SigUSD balance. Might consider breaking ERG balance into whatever is in the treasury multi-sig and short-term wallet if you think easy.


[08/21/2022 11:08 AM] Justin1000#9555
Subject to discussion but maybe a good idea for liquidations to target replacing whatever monthly USDT spending is. Would think easy enough for the market maker to just target that on a monthly basis. If price, goes higher then could consider a more opportunistic larger size liquidation.

Hi @everyone,

Kindly be informed that:
1. I have sent email to Karm Legal Services with the request to arrange a meeting and I will update you once I get a reply.

2. I have spoken to a Manager at Unit Global Pay and he has informed that a virtual card is always attached to a name of individual, not to the company. If you would like, the name can be changed. Just let me know and we can complete KYC-verification for this person, will add as admin/employee and change the name on the card. 

Thank you


[08/31/2022 2:39 PM] morphic#4133
So, company name cannot be on the card?  BTW, how much EF pays for the card monthly?


[08/31/2022 7:04 PM] Stacie#8189
It will be corporate card by under the name if representative


[08/31/2022 7:04 PM] Stacie#8189
There is one time charge only


[09/01/2022 6:15 AM] Justin1000#9555
Eva should be 566.34 ERGs this month (1800/3.1783). No need for bonus from now on. Note I think she continues to do a really good job though and be important member of team. It's just given the current market conditions, our budget constraints and fact she was given quite a lot of ERGs at a low price that we can probably go without bonus for now. Maybe can consider a raise at some point if market improves or ergo does well.

The DLT activity doesn't include software development and I'm not sure what "providing database management solutions" means. Is there a list activities we can choose from? (with descriptions)

@everyone, I would like to discuss with you the optimisation of salary distribution.

Over 60% of monthly wages are paid to Developers which is pretty logical outcome. Majority of them are paid in ERG. What do you think if we propose to them to be paid in ERG and SigUSD. Proportion can be 30% ERG and 70% SigUSD. In this case if they agree to this, we can minimise ERG treasury expenses and protect it from volatility spikes. 

Please, share your thoughts about it.

Thank you

[09/20/2022 9:03 AM] morphic#4133
Seems like none of this reflects the actual EF activities. Maybe no need to use "crypto related" activities and just use Software Development as the company's main activity?


[09/20/2022 9:03 AM] morphic#4133
Another question is whether such a company can put crypto assets on its balance sheet and do operations with crypto assets (custodial/non-custodial is also a question) and under which conditions.


[09/20/2022 9:08 AM] morphic#4133
In other words, if we register just a regular company there, what crypto operations we will be able to do and how crypto assets are taken into accounting?


[09/20/2022 9:10 AM] Stacie#8189
Crypto assets we can take into a bank account very easily by using either BitOasis app or services of Coinmena. To exchange crypto assets we might need 3-4 working days, but it will definitely work


[09/20/2022 9:12 AM] Stacie#8189
However, I am not sure that we will be able to establish a regular company in Dubai when basically we are doing Node development and software development for crypto asset. They are very particular here


[09/20/2022 9:13 AM] Stacie#8189
However, we can check this information as it is assumptions and we don’t know for sure


[09/20/2022 12:53 PM] morphic#4133
As there is not clear choice I think we need a local consulting.


[09/20/2022 12:54 PM] morphic#4133
The most tricky question is legalisation of the EF treasury which we now have on multisig address.


[09/20/2022 12:56 PM] morphic#4133
How we can put the treasury on the balance sheet?


[09/20/2022 12:57 PM] morphic#4133
The next question (which should be kept in mind) is how to convert the treasury into fiat on bank account?


[09/20/2022 12:58 PM] morphic#4133
Those are the main reasons we need a legal entity in a first place.


[09/20/2022 1:01 PM] morphic#4133
We don't do mining. Don't organise exchange or trading. Don't issue new assets. Don't provide any services for money, so the company will not have income. The company will only have spending.


[09/20/2022 1:03 PM] morphic#4133
If I'm right, these are conditions which need to be communicated to a local lawyer to find appropriate structure of the entity.


[09/20/2022 1:23 PM] Stacie#8189
Yes, we definitely need to have a consultation and proper planning, however, my concern here only with activity and, in my point of view, we should have an activity which allows us to have some income as never know what can be useful in the future. Hence, if there is a possibility to have an activity which does not close the door for getting profits, we should take that. Especially in Dubai when till June 2023 you will not have any income taxes involved, after that date 9% of tax will be implemented.


[09/20/2022 1:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
Was there not an option presented on the meeting that was most suited for Layer1's? Think it was just 'Blockchain' or something IIRC?


[09/20/2022 1:35 PM] Stacie#8189
It was Distributed Ledger Technology Services.


[09/20/2022 2:07 PM] glasgowm#9381
'database management solutions and ancillary services' 

So basically means 'providing necessary support to the primary activities or operation of an organization, system, etc.' to a blockchain. Think that would be an ok fit?


[09/20/2022 2:08 PM] glasgowm#9381
But not sure if using a market-maker would count as 'trading' ?


[09/20/2022 2:58 PM] Stacie#8189
Yeah, there are a lot of nuances which we need to discuss

[09/20/2022 4:02 PM] Justin1000#9555
FYI for reference: the agreement drafted in Singapore for the confirmation of asset ownership. It was just to make it all legally clean.


[09/20/2022 5:04 PM] morphic#4133
Yes, it is best to choose activity type which reflects our actual business. On the other hand special purpose legal entity can be created when necessary so that EF can be 100% owner of another entity with appropritate special business activity.


[09/20/2022 5:06 PM] morphic#4133
By restricting every entity into one particular activity type they probably encourage creation of many entities.


[09/20/2022 5:59 PM] Stacie#8189
I am not sure that it is the best to create a company under every activity. It will increase costs and paper work which might not be necessarily and can be avoided. The structure is supposed to be simple. If we can find the activity which can include both, why not then?


[09/20/2022 6:00 PM] morphic#4133
yes, that is for sure

[09/21/2022 12:16 PM] Stacie#8189
@everyone, we got a reply from Singapore. 

Referring to the context, I would like to suggest:
1. Ask Singapore team to prepare an invoice for 6 months of Nominee Director agreement and Company’s secretary fees. Hence, instead of SGD17,265.50 we will be paying SGD8,632.75. However, we might need to extend their services if there are any complications with company’s strike off. And our goal here is to make the liquidation as fast as possible. 
2. We need to share with them our Accounting Book which is prepared from our side in the format Singapore has requested. I just need to know if the format is the same or there is another form. And we do not have any debts from any Creditor. 

After that some paper work will be applied and we can initiate the liquidation. Costs might be between SGD3,500 and SGD4,500.

Hence, as the f now and in optimal conditions our costs for liquidation will be between SGD12,132.75 and SGD13,132.75

Please, advise if I can go ahead and request new invoices for 6 months services

@everyone, I have spoke to Amin from Coinmena and he said that the Banks in Dubai are very condescending to crypto and might ask questions only with the deposit more than $1 million. Hence, with our capacity $50K per month it will not raise any questions even if the company does not deal with cryptocurrency as a main activity. 

Just in case if there are any questions, we can provide as a proof the agreement with Coinmena and that’s it. This what happened on his practice.


[09/23/2022 2:42 PM] morphic#4133
This means we don't need to choose crypto related activitiy and can just choose something like Software Development?


[09/23/2022 2:58 PM] Stacie#8189
Yes


[09/23/2022 2:58 PM] Stacie#8189
Indeed


[09/26/2022 4:56 PM] Stacie#8189
Hi @everyone,

Kindly be informed that we have received 2 activity options to choose from Karm Legal. Please advise if there is anything which suits us the most.

TRC-20


[09/29/2022 5:40 AM] Justin1000#9555
Some of Sing expenses in S$ right? If so, will need to convert to USDT at fx rate (guess is about 1.435).


[09/29/2022 5:41 AM] Justin1000#9555
Reminder there is a S$15k (~$10k) deposit owed back to us from last year so that will make up for a lot o the Singapore expenses when it comes back when everything is done.


[09/29/2022 5:44 AM] Stacie#8189
Yes


[09/29/2022 5:45 AM] Stacie#8189
Singapore works with the company who receives USDT and sends to their account SGD


[09/29/2022 5:45 AM] Stacie#8189
So we can send USDT


[09/30/2022 1:30 PM] Stacie#8189
@everyone, please be informed that I have communicated with DMCC directly and they have shared their company setup plans and License activities. Please, find it below. 

Kindly review and let me know which option will be chosen:
1. Karm Legal 
2. DMCC

And which activity we will be taking.

Thank you

[10/03/2022 2:01 PM] morphic#4133
Couldn't find info on Karm Legal.


[10/03/2022 2:06 PM] morphic#4133
With DMCC do we need any physical office? 
It seems Option 4: Standard Setup Fees is good enough for us.


[10/03/2022 2:16 PM] morphic#4133
However EF will need to pay 22,110 AED annually so for 3 years it will cost 34,185 + 2*22,110 = 78405 AED (~21349.21 USD).
At the same time if we choose `PP OPTION 1:PrimePlus Package` (which has 3-year license) we will need to pay 76100 AED upfront. 
So it seams that if we go with DMCC then OPTION 4: is our best choice.


[10/03/2022 4:34 PM] Stacie#8189
Depends on the activity. Some of them require office, some of them - not. There is a column in the sheet where this requirement is mentioned


[10/03/2022 4:36 PM] Stacie#8189
Yes, agreed. For 3 years it is better option


[10/03/2022 4:37 PM] morphic#4133
I meant option 4, for one year upfront and then 2 renewals, it looks cheaper


[10/03/2022 5:52 PM] Stacie#8189
Yeah, I meant for 3 separate years extension


[10/03/2022 5:59 PM] morphic#4133
and the activity should be Software House, this looks like the most reasonable.


[10/03/2022 6:36 PM] Stacie#8189
Alright, let’s discuss it tomorrow on the EF meeting and finalise it


[10/03/2022 6:36 PM] Stacie#8189

And please @everyone advise if we can remove the transaction from the accounting book where we do not have proof of transaction. It was some transactions that had been paid in BTC or USDT in the beginning and will not affect our overall performance. I have suggested this option as @kushti  is only the one who can assist with it, however, he is busy with other things and it might take some time. Please, share your thoughts. Thank you.


[10/04/2022 3:54 PM] Justin1000#9555
I think it is fine. Our transactions are all just non-profit outflow transactions anyway. Main thing is the numbers are properly presented and all make sense and no red flags. All numbers should balance.

@everyone, kindly be informed that I have calculated our expenses from the launching company in December till 3rd of October, and our spending is around $2m ($1,946,127 to be precise) which is  SGD 2,782,961. In this case, our Strike Off would be more complicated as if the expenses are more than SGD 1,000,000 it brings additional attention to the company. Please, advise what do you think we should do.

@Armeanio do we already have a voting post?


[10/06/2022 1:51 PM] Justin1000#9555
What kind of attention and from whom? Did Ching mention this in one of the calls? Not sure we can do anything about it but if is potentially a serious problem, maybe we should have a quick call with Ching before we send over the data. 

I took a look and the lists of transactions look good and comprehensive to me. But I would suggest below changes to help with presentation.

*Some monthly reward payments for December without name specified. Should try to infer who those were to and put in there.
*See if can fill in some more details on some of the lines as some details missing. For example one line says “for 4.0.23” so not sure what this is and to whom. 
*A lot of misspellings that should fix – spell check. And can double check names…some are misspelled.
*Capitalize names where possible
*”ErgoDex Funding” -> “ErgoDex Grant”
*For balance sheet data, we should make sure the beginning balance less spendings in this sheet equal the ending balance


[10/06/2022 3:03 PM] morphic#4133
I'm not sure but the "attention" may include Source of Funds request (for the funds EF had spent) as an example.


[10/06/2022 4:40 PM] Stacie#8189

So what do you think? @everyone


[10/07/2022 8:05 PM] morphic#4133
What will be the GST registration fees?


[10/07/2022 8:09 PM] Stacie#8189
That’s the question is in progress. I will let you know once I get the answer. So if I understood correctly, first, we need to register our company for GST companies list and then initiate Strike off and reverse registration fees


[10/07/2022 8:09 PM] Stacie#8189
The procedure is becoming more complex in this case


[10/07/2022 8:09 PM] Stacie#8189
But I will get details


[10/08/2022 9:37 AM] Stacie#8189
1. If you have overseas expenses paid to suppliers > SGD1m, then the company needs to register for Reverse Charge GST.

2. The GST Registration is slightly complex. The company needs to register with the supplier invoices and the amount billed/paid by the co. The IRAS-GST will evaluate and then fix a GST Registration Date.

3. From this date, the company needs to pay 7%(next year 2023 is 8% and 2024 9%) as Reverse GST to IRAS. 

4. For payment, Company needs to pay in SGD. On-going the company's bank account is to be GIRO-linked to for auto-debit after the submission (quarterly or monthly). 

5. It is quite complex. It is not advisable to get onto GST, especially if you are going for Strike-off. 

6. I can discuss with you and Joseph or other members if you can send me a link here. I am available at 11am, 8th Oct, Sat. 

Thanks.


[10/08/2022 9:38 AM] Stacie#8189
@everyone, here is a reply from Mr. Ching. Please let me know your thoughts about it


[10/08/2022 9:59 AM] Justin1000#9555
That is crazy and strange they never mentioned this. Would never have gone with Sing had we known.


[10/08/2022 10:15 AM] Justin1000#9555
But the amount in USDT as base currency is only US$377,723. And I imagine the amount in relation to actual contracts signed even including Huobi listing and including ERG payments is below S$1mm. 

Can you calculate how much was paid under contracts signed? Including to exchanges and developers etc. As far as I know, most people don’t get rewards under contracts. And not sure exchanges even count as "suppliers" per the rules.


[10/08/2022 10:24 AM] Stacie#8189
However, EF paid to the people and exchanges and it was our expenses anyway. 

I will calculate only contracted expenses and send to you in the evening.

Thank you

For October we are expecting to complete following salary payments:
- ERG 15,970;
- SigUSD 30,400 (inclusive of Raffles payment);
- USDT 11,836 (Angie, Morphic and Greenhat’s transfer).

If we are calculating everything in  ERG, it will be approximately ERG 35,168 (1 ERG = 2.2 USD).

@kushti, @morphic, please assist with transferring of the amount to pay salaries for October.

Seems okay to me.

Did you say for the company in Dubai that russian citizens need to be resident in the middle east @Stacie ?


[10/19/2022 3:50 PM] Stacie#8189
No, it is not like that. I just heard from 2 sources that due to geopolitical situation right now it might be difficult to open a company in Dubai if one of owners has Russian passport only and there is no other residency.

However, we can double check this with the legal entity we will be working with.

Anyway, I am sure there are some options to overcome this condition.


[10/19/2022 3:51 PM] Stacie#8189
As I have seen other examples when Russians are setting up companies in Dubai and everything works


[10/19/2022 3:52 PM] Stacie#8189
It was just a question to keep in mind


[10/19/2022 4:12 PM] Justin1000#9555
Okay, if it comes up the can tell them so few transactions because we set up the entity in order to open a bank account and that fell through early this year hence moving to new location.


[10/19/2022 4:18 PM] Stacie#8189
Alright, I think we came to the conclusion and I can share it with Singapore. I will do it tomorrow, hence, if anyone wants to share any additional thoughts, please let me know.

Thank you

I had a meeting with a Firm in the US that is helping El Salvador craft crypto legislation around creating a business environment.   

I think that is an environment we should consider rotating too instead of Dubai.   First is they have maintained neutrality, so members nationality is not an issue.   

Banking has a low barrier of entry so that should be much easier.   The process itself is relatively quick, and would give us pretty early access to a jurisdiction I think long term may be more stable regarding larger geopolitical drama.


[10/19/2022 9:35 PM] Armeanio#0321
The cost itself is relatively low compared to Singapore. We could get white gloved by a firm that is crafting actual legislation and come into a fresh market with some nice contacts that potentially could adopt or provide education about some of the technology we build.


[10/20/2022 7:43 AM] Stacie#8189
Can we see some numbers for the setting costs?


[10/20/2022 8:02 AM] Stacie#8189
The reasons why I have proposed Dubai are:
1. I am physically there and kushti regularly comes, hence, in term of Business development face to face meeting will be more effective than online calls. It gives stronger impression. 
2. There are a lot of head offices of big crypto companies here, for example, Binance. And there are plenty of conferences and forums in Dubai related to crypto. 
3. The environment itself is crypto friendly and constantly growing.
4. In long term prospective, the entity in Dubai will have stronger power and greater potential.


[10/20/2022 9:59 AM] morphic#4133
I think we can fallback to El Salvador option if Dubai doesn't work for us. For international business (which we want to do) Dubai is more established jurisdiction and we should try  open EF entity AND bank account there. 
And I think the key point, is having an account with IBAN, not the entity itself.
So, we need to find a lawyer partner which will be able to do it as a package (entity + account), the lawyer who knows how to overcome limitations and can help with bank application for account opening.


[10/20/2022 10:06 AM] morphic#4133
EF don't need yet another entity without bank account

Please, let me know if I can sell ERG to USDT or we will use some another option? And I have USDT2999 as remaining balance. 

Thank you


[11/01/2022 5:41 PM] morphic#4133
I think yes, you can sell, but for next month we definitely need to have some discussion on budget and liquidation strategy. I don't think selling at current prices is fortunate for EF.
At the same time EF is not efficient at using market conditions for optimal ERG liquidation.  Just recently the price was above $5 with big enough volume and EF had all the insider information for what is coming. Yet no liquidation happened. We already voted about it and decided many times that EF should do liquidations when price is up.
Now,  EF is faced with current obligations and has to liquidate unfavourably.
I propose:
1) We need to assign someone responsible for liquidation (and this shouldn't be kushti, he told many times he don't want to manage funds). 
2) The responsible person should have enough ERGs at hand (say 20K) and be ready to create orders once the price is up. The liquidation decision for certain condition should be pre-approved.
3) We need to reduce monthly budget leaving only essential spendings


[11/01/2022 5:52 PM] Stacie#8189
I agree, however, wanted to tell that we do not have any unnecessary spendings, it is just salaries, Raffles, Hackathon and some times marketing. 

Unfortunate situation is the low price which brings us to the situation we are now.

I completely agree that we should wisely sell ERG when the price is high and maintain the balance of USDT and SigUSD.


[11/02/2022 7:39 AM] Justin1000#9555
At this terrible price, I think should just sell enough to cover the required USDT outgoing.

I don’t have confidence myself in EF predicting price changes despite having “insider info”. Crypto market seems random most of the time and Ergo perpetually undervalued to me. 

I think what happened last time was the new MM was taking over in early September and price ran up right before merge, then dropped through floor soon after MM had taken over and liquidation had not yet had time to be executed. 

Armeanio can confirm if CoinLS is ready now to execute sales next time at short notice. I guess main takeaway for me this time is when price reaches target, should just execute whatever sales desired in short time period and not spread it out as price could drop rapidly like this time. There were some extinuating circumstances but we were too passive and should not wait to seize any opportunity in future. Volume is high enough to absorb quickly whatever little EF sells anyway, especially if price rising when executed.

The price situation is really bad by the way. Must be having big impact on new project launches and Ergopad, Nightowl, Spectrum etc. The inflation rate is way down vs last year but still high. I guess what is happening is that without new exchange listings and with the bad market, there is few new buyers to absorb the miner sales and price is pulled down. Maybe Rosenbridge(+Cardano community marketing) and/or new exchange listings could turn it around.


[11/02/2022 10:06 AM] morphic#4133
yeah, I'm not comfortable predicting the market either, but my point is we don't need CoinLS at all to liquidate for 3 months EF USDT budget needs. The responsible person can use grid bots (on Kucoin for example, gate.io and huobi also have them) to create market orders. 
As for price, EF should start DCA once the price is above $4 and until enough USDT accumulated for 3 month.


[11/02/2022 10:07 AM] morphic#4133
what is the average USDT spending per month (for the last 3 months)?


[11/02/2022 10:51 AM] morphic#4133
@Stacie I looked at your table `Budget VS Actual_2022` and couldn't get USDT monthly obligations. One problem with the table is that everything is shown in USDT, but EF have obligations nominated in ERGs. Those ERGs budget is fixed from month to month, but USDT obligations depend on the price. Could you please add a column for each month (at least for 3 last months) with ERGs values.


[11/02/2022 11:16 AM] Stacie#8189
I will share with you the numbers. Just give me please some time


[11/02/2022 11:27 AM] Stacie#8189
From the budget it is not convenient to take payments in different currency as in the budget everything is USD and all charges are transferred to USD for better understanding, because we use many currencies for payments.


[11/02/2022 11:29 AM] Stacie#8189
However, I can send monthly total amount of ERG, USDT and SigUSD paid


[11/02/2022 11:39 AM] morphic#4133
Yes, but you also loose actual financial information. How you can do fin-planning if you don't know how much you need to liquidate? How much USDT reserves you need for next 3-6 months? 
Also USDT nominations have big impact on EF financials during market downturn, and should be reduced. When market goes up, them ERG nominations can be reduced.
So, I suggest to put all the original information in the sheet and have both better transparency for the USD values and also clear values for ERG, USDT budget components.


[11/02/2022 11:40 AM] morphic#4133
Yes, please.


[11/02/2022 12:20 PM] Stacie#8189
I think that will make it a little bit difficult to understand when in one table different currencies are combined. Maybe we can have a separate predictions for USDT and SigUSD and analyse it. To make everything clear.

Additionally, our USDT payments do not include only salaries, it contains also the payments for some press releases and so one. Moreover, I believe if the price for ERG is high, we can have USDT treasury and support the volume of it


[11/02/2022 12:26 PM] morphic#4133
I don't know which way, but having data in the table is way more useful than not to have it at all and not be able to do simple calculations.


[11/02/2022 12:29 PM] Stacie#8189
Yes, I agree. That is why I am considering the simplest way to prepare the predictions and prepare a separate sheet where we will clearly see what is happening and take a rational decision


[11/02/2022 12:32 PM] morphic#4133
please do


[11/02/2022 12:40 PM] Stacie#8189

I like it more - normal Excel. And I share sheets on the Google drive where you can see up to date transactions. But I don’t have any issues to start using Google workbooks


[11/02/2022 4:22 PM] morphic#4133
So we are burning on average every month 25966 ERGs directly and 18000 ERGs via USDT payments. (with $2 liquidation price)
I excluded the one time payments where obvious


[11/02/2022 4:23 PM] morphic#4133
Please put and share a link


[11/02/2022 4:24 PM] morphic#4133
@Stacie the ERG values don't overlap with SigUSD and USDT, right?


[11/02/2022 4:26 PM] morphic#4133
One benefit of google table, is that anyone can contribute and suggest edits (not do them directly)


[11/02/2022 4:29 PM] morphic#4133
@Stacie so you put Benjamin to ERGs category?


[11/02/2022 4:29 PM] Stacie#8189
Yes, based on his agreement


[11/02/2022 4:30 PM] Stacie#8189
No


[11/02/2022 4:32 PM] morphic#4133
This is wrong. The contract is based on fixed USD rate  and also fixed ERGs rate. So USD part should go to USD spendings. I doesn't matter how you pay, the obligation part matters.


[11/02/2022 4:34 PM] morphic#4133
So you need to review all the spendings and separate
1) regular from one-time
2) nominated in USD, EUR, etc. and nominated in ERGs


[11/02/2022 4:34 PM] morphic#4133
I want to understand our burn-rate.


[11/02/2022 4:35 PM] morphic#4133
For this I don't need one-time payments, so they need to filtered out


[11/02/2022 4:35 PM] morphic#4133
And for others I need to see fixed obligations in ERGs and separately fixed obligation in non-ERG currencies


[11/02/2022 4:39 PM] Stacie#8189
I think for us it will be very confusing if we consider payments based on obligation, but not in paid currency. 

Otherwise, we need to review agreements and make some amendments there


[11/02/2022 4:44 PM] morphic#4133
I created this table which shows how fast the remaining treasury will be burnt out

[11/02/2022 4:46 PM] morphic#4133
The ERGs liquidated depend on price while ERGs payed doesn't.


[11/02/2022 4:48 PM] morphic#4133
You need to record all the original transactions in the currency that is used. this is a transaction log. It can be further analysed. But if you don't include currency information, it is not possible to analize.


[11/02/2022 4:49 PM] morphic#4133
The values in the table are not correct, Benjamins salary is included into `ERGs payed` and doesn't decrease when the price increase, but it should.


[11/02/2022 4:59 PM] morphic#4133
@Stacie as you can see `ERG payed` is very high, and it doesn't depend on price. I doubt we really have such high  obligations in ERGs.


[11/02/2022 5:01 PM] morphic#4133
So, to calculate the burn rate accurately, we need to separate true ERGs obligations. And also separate all one-time payments.


[11/02/2022 5:02 PM] Stacie#8189
I just did not get that you want to see permanent payments in ERG and payed in ERG


[11/02/2022 5:03 PM] morphic#4133
I don't care how we pay, I want to understand `how much` we pay.


[11/02/2022 5:03 PM] Stacie#8189
Here in the table were displayed in actual payed currency


[11/02/2022 5:04 PM] morphic#4133
And `how much` we need to pay in USDT directly influence how much ERGs need to be liquidated.


[11/02/2022 5:04 PM] morphic#4133
And this depends on the price.


[11/02/2022 5:06 PM] morphic#4133

[11/02/2022 5:17 PM] morphic#4133
Ok, I suggest you do part of it as an example and let me see. I will try to calculate the burn rate table. 
The key thing is to identify fixed obligations in ERGs and non-ERGs separately.


[11/02/2022 5:19 PM] morphic#4133
And also separate one-time payments from monthly recurring payments.


[11/02/2022 6:39 PM] Stacie#8189

Thank you


[11/18/2022 4:14 PM] morphic#4133
Hi, no, his timesheet is not reasonable. 
He likely spent no more than 5 working days (judging by his 1 commit to sigma and 3 commits to explorer-backend and the amount of committed changes) 
Also we already payed for September.
If we assume he was working for 8 hours/day then I suggest:
1) we agree for 40 hours final payment for October
2) do the payment.

For November we are expecting to complete following salary payments (calculated with the price 1 ERG = 1.35 USD):
- ERG Paid - 17,330;
- ERG liquidated - 41,086.

Total ERG 58,416.

@kushti, @morphic, please assist with transferring of the amount to pay salaries for November. 

Thank you


[11/23/2022 10:26 AM] glasgowm#9381
Why are we liquidating that much? Looking at October seems only about 12k ERG needed from SigUSD/USDT?


[11/23/2022 10:40 AM] glasgowm#9381
Maybe someone can write a bot that trades from the common wallet into SigUSD using the dex? @Ergo Foundation 

We should have 6figs in SigUSD at a minimum IMO - even at these prices. Creates no sell pressure, and we would've saved a ton of money of the past year if we'd been doing this consistently


[11/23/2022 12:08 PM] morphic#4133
I believe the numbers should come from the Google table you've recently tided up https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sMoX34djjielB9i8Elw82QkpeT4xnMscqtx_A7bkNzM/edit?usp=sharing
But, there is no numbers for November. 
@Stacie, which table you used for 
- ERG Paid - 17,330;
- ERG liquidated - 41,086
?


[11/23/2022 12:11 PM] Stacie#8189
This is an actual spending and will be filed out once all payments are completed

@everyone I added one column (`Reduced`) to the table on the first sheet. 
And I propose uniform reduction of all USDT lines by approx. 50% (the amounts are my suggestions). 
The reduced amounts are put `on-hold` i.e. they will become EF's debt. 
This debt can be payed out as soon as ERG price is above $3 (of maybe even $4, please suggest).
Once the price is above the threshold, @Stacie can liquidate enough ERGs to repay the debt.

[11/23/2022 10:21 PM] mhs_sam#1471
"Raffle" aka My team will hit hard by this reduction. However, I'm willing to accept it.


[11/23/2022 10:24 PM] mhs_sam#1471
btw, I was receiving 22700 USD equivalent in ERG, IDK if it's correct to put it in ERG liquidated section..


[11/23/2022 10:27 PM] mhs_sam#1471
Since I have to pay 22.7k USD monthly to my team, I have to provide the reduced amount out of my pocket. anyway, as I said I'm willing to accept it.


[11/23/2022 11:03 PM] morphic#4133
It is not about how the payment is done using ERGs or USDT. It is about in which currency the obligations are. Benjamin is also receiving in ERGs, but the obligation is fixed in USD, so ERG price dropping automatically means more ERGs to be liquidated for the same USD amount to pay.
Most of the obligations in ERGs was established when the price was around $10. In USD equivalent they all now more that 5 time less valuable for people receiving them.
That is why I think it is fair to cut USD obligations leaving ERG obligations as is.
And note, that the amounts in Reduced column will become kind of investments until the price is above the threshold, the which point they will be payed.
We need to minimize non-ERG obligations as much as we can.


[11/23/2022 11:07 PM] mhs_sam#1471
oh, I got the meaning of liquidated Erg now. 
Yeah it's completely reasonable to reduce the ERG payments atm.


[11/23/2022 11:19 PM] glasgowm#9381
Confusing phrasing, assumed we were liquidating the ergs to pay them the  USDT/SigUSD. 

Who are we actually paying in USDT?


[11/23/2022 11:23 PM] morphic#4133
Again, it is not how we pay. It is about how much ERG need to be sold. If you expect to receive 1000 in USD equivalent there are two ways: 1) I convert ERG to USDT and send you USDT or 2) I send you ERGs, but so much that you can convert them to USDT and get expected 1000 USD.


[11/23/2022 11:24 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah I get it just stating it's confusing. Should be ERG paid (at USD rate) unless we're actually liquidating imo


[11/23/2022 11:30 PM] morphic#4133
yes, the word `liquidated` is not ideal here. But at the same time, we really have many ways to pay which are not important. What is important is to understand how much ERGs we need spend from the treasury based on our monthly obligations. When obligations are fixed in ERGs it is simple case. When they are fixed in USD, then amount of ERGs depend on the price and becomes critical now.


[11/23/2022 11:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
or `ERG Salaried`, `USD Base` maybe; 'paid' implies that ERGs are sent and `ERG liquidated` implies 'erg sold' 

But do we have any strict USDT obligations or are we sending everyone on this list ERG?


[11/23/2022 11:32 PM] morphic#4133
I receive USDT via GUP transfer to have legal documents of income.


[11/23/2022 11:34 PM] morphic#4133
Benjamin is receiving ERGs, but he is immediately converting them to USDT and then withdraw on EUR bank card.


[11/23/2022 11:35 PM] glasgowm#9381
Fair enough, I imagine the sigusd ones are erg, raffle team is erg; so probably not a big % - but should try and switch anyone else on USDT to ERG.


[11/23/2022 11:36 PM] glasgowm#9381
If they sell they sell but saves us doing a bunch at once + probably more likely to hold a bit


[11/23/2022 11:36 PM] morphic#4133
I would do the same as Benjamin, but my accountant go nuts hearing about crypto


[11/23/2022 11:40 PM] morphic#4133
conversions itself is not a big deal, the main issue is USD obligations when the price is dropping.
Remember just recently we were discussing to switch everyone to USD obligations actually when ERG prices were skyrocketing.


[11/23/2022 11:44 PM] glasgowm#9381
The good ol' days


[11/23/2022 11:44 PM] morphic#4133
So I think accumulating debt on EF side is a solution to no change agreements, but save the treasury from burning too fast. Also this kind of `forced investments`, later we can pay in full and even with some interests.


[11/24/2022 12:03 AM] glasgowm#9381
yeah seems fair to me. $4 would be better for the treasury ofc. $3 does seem to be the point below which we struggle though and would probably opt for that especially for anyone dependent on the income so too much debt doesnt build up.


[11/29/2022 9:10 AM] Stacie#8189
@everyone, please advise about the salaries for this month: will we pay only fixed amount in ERG or put everything on hold for now?


[11/29/2022 2:38 PM] mhs_sam#1471
@morphic with you're new message, I'm a bit confused. My teams payment is 22.7k USD per month; it seems you've considered it 12700 usd.


[11/29/2022 3:00 PM] kushti#0978
EF is already in debt before me and Justin, it is too risky to increase obligations I think


[11/29/2022 3:02 PM] kushti#0978
I proposed to mint sigusd few times, but proposals got no support


[11/29/2022 3:05 PM] morphic#4133
sorry, my bad, fixed the table now


[11/29/2022 3:09 PM] morphic#4133
I also accumulated 50K+ debt. But what we should do, fire people? Risk is moderate for EF, as it is long term and no interest on top of it. Also we should be prepared to liquidate immediately on the first chance.

👍 

[11/29/2022 3:19 PM] glasgowm#9381
Maybe it could be paired with some sort of bonus - the longer the wait (in terms of price), the more they get? Might soften the blow and help the treasury.  

We should be liquidating slowly via MM to repay kushti/Justin already imo - thought we were. But it's a bit of a black box since only kushti/morphic have access to do these things. Didn't remembering seeing any proposals for sigusd minting, would've supported it - what do we need to do to start this? I can chuck up a general proposal on the forum to vote on but exact liquidation numbers I'm not sure on.


[11/29/2022 3:58 PM] kushti#0978

@Armeanio @Justin1000 please join the discussion and vote.


[12/02/2022 10:08 AM] Justin1000#9555
FYI: I am not familiar at all with Cardano dexes but just took a quick look and seem valuations very roughly:
*Sundae Swap – not sure but price down from 20 cents to 1.5 cent over past 1 year so probably not that high
*WingRiders - $10mm valuation fully diluted per coingecko (only US$5k trading volume)
*Minswap – looks like could be $60mm fully diluted valuation because coingecko says total supply is 5bn
*Muesliswap – US$8.5mm according to Coingecko

So we might not want to read too much into that initial “$100mm” valuation for SPF if that is indeed implied by the IDO price. I think room for optimism they will do much better than all the above and they are more than just a Cardano dex but there is certainly a lot of uncertainty about what sale price valuation of SPF tokens might be over time so should keep in mind when thinking of budgeting.

[12/04/2022 5:16 AM] Justin1000#9555
I was thinking about what to say if investors ask about “burn rate” etc. And came up with this overly simple model. But maybe useful for discussion on cuts. I am doubtful we should be rushing to make such deep cuts and accumulate debt etc. 

Just for discussion but my prelim thinking is maybe the case to use for short-term planning is the highlighted one. 

We could cut say 12k ERGs, assume for now SPF long-term valuation will be around $30mm and then be looking at 36 months run-time (not accounting for higher price or big one-off expenses). Now 36 months is not long enough when considering the need for one-offs expenses but maybe its good enough for now because:
-Can always see how thing shape out over next 60-90 days and make deeper cuts later if needed (or more hopefully reverse cuts).
-I am doubtful need say guaranteed ~5 years runway (especially at $1.35 price...) because of diminishing role of EF and because if in 2-3 years Ergo adoption is not taking off at all, long-term viability is in question.
-The current price is a joke (1/130th Cardano mkt cap for example). If ERG really stays at $1.35 for say ~2 years despite falling inflation rate, again long-term viability in question.


[12/06/2022 7:59 AM] Stacie#8189
@Justin1000, could you advise please how much we should pay Eva for this month?


[12/06/2022 8:53 AM] Justin1000#9555
Well I got the calculation. Its 1800/1.3834=1301.142114. But I am not clear if we are intending to cut that or not. I think going forward, it needs to be cut given the market and current ERG price but not sure its good practice to cut for a month already gone. Also, I don't agree with the really steep cut proposed in the sheet initially. Eva did agree to get rid of her bonus months ago. So guess just hold off for a little while until its clearer what we are doing...


[12/06/2022 9:00 AM] Stacie#8189
Alright, I am waiting for your confirmation. Thank you


[12/08/2022 8:50 PM] Stacie#8189
@Armeanio, @glasgowm, I have sent a request to sign accounting sheet. Please, kindly sign


[12/09/2022 4:37 AM] Justin1000#9555
Just pay this. I will now tell her there needs to be a cut at least as long as price stays low and try to come to some good arrangement. But I guess for November work already done we should stick to what was pre-agreed. Kinda too late to talk to her now about cutting pay for last month and I haven't had the time!


[12/09/2022 9:34 AM] Stacie#8189
Alright


[12/09/2022 3:38 PM] morphic#4133
@Stacie, from Jozinek
"Hey Alexandr, Stacie wanted me to contact you as she cannot for some reason sent me salary for October, even when I explained to her that we agreed to terminate the contract on October 15th. Can you please contact her and confirm that "
What is the problem?


[12/09/2022 4:47 PM] Stacie#8189
I will complete the payment


[12/11/2022 4:42 AM] Justin1000#9555
I proposed to Eva:
*ERG $1.00-2.00, monthly pay $1,000 in ERG
*ERG $2.00-3.00, monthly pay $1,250 in ERG
*ERG $3.00-5.00, monthly pay $1,500 in ERG
*ERG >$5.00, monthly pay back to $1,800 in ERG
*And when ERG goes above $10, we get Jinse partnership back and consider further pay hike but no promises. 

She is not too happy about it but accepted. She normally puts in long hours so I told her she could cut her hours a little under these circumstances (maybe she will do some translation work on side). So guess shouldn’t be at risk of losing her in short-term anyway.


[12/11/2022 2:31 PM] Stacie#8189
@everyone, kindly accept my sincere apologies with the delay with Financial report and budgeting. Got busy with work and personal things. I will be completing everything in the nearest 3 days.

@Ergo Foundation


[12/13/2022 8:06 PM] glasgowm#9381
Optimistic case is very optimistic given ergo market-cap is currently only at $89m, but could yield a decent amount for the EF over time. 

I'm not too concerned about issues with viability impacting price, more with global macro. Sure this could be the bottom, but we could also get a decade of stagflation instead, erg could go back to $0.20 and we'd be contractually obliged to give MrS alone 45k ERG per month so need to decide what to do here. 

But outside a few high spendings think most of the fat has already been trimmed and agree a couple years is probably good enough to see if erg becomes viable.


[12/14/2022 5:54 AM] Justin1000#9555
*Ergo’s current market cap might not be that relevant and was even passed by Kaspa (ridiculous). The crypto market is a disaster and incapable of even close to efficiently valuing projects over time. Also I don’t think Ergo is going to stay so cheap for long…
*More importantly,Spectrum will be on Cardano, market cap 130x Ergo’s and they are going to get millions of funding there. That kinda money in their hands should deliver some big results on dev and marketing front. 
*The $100mm assumes fully diluted valuation but they have a long emission schedule. I think less than ½ their tokens issued after ~4 years. So for example in 2 years, if they only had 25% outstanding that would be only $25mm mkt cap (but we could be selling well before then when supply is tight).

So I don’t think overly optimistic and the seed investors seem pretty happy and they came in at $30mm. But who knows with crypto so I don’t like to speculate too much. And something could go wrong big time for them. But I could also imagine a much higher average valuation as well over nest 3 years for them.

My main point was we can assume that middle case for now for budgetary decision making, check back in 90 days and see how reality is matching up with that and adjust then rather than making big cuts now.


[12/14/2022 5:59 AM] Justin1000#9555
On market in general, I tend to agree with Arthur's latest, bottom probably in unless some more crazy stuff happens like Binance collapse. I have hard time imagining Ergo at $0.20 myself…would be pretty much disastrous but I think also imply catastrophe for the whole industry. Ergo has held the 8000 sats pretty well post 2020 so that might imply $2500 bitcoin. Pretty much wipe out! 

But might a good point about those contracts. It is still possible something crazy happens and we drop below a dollar for a short time at least. I guess ideally would be clause in there capping the payment at below $1. Else we will just have to ask them to waive part of the payment or something. I dunno…pretty extreme situation.

Maybe @Stacie can can do new budget with all the cuts made to date so we can check latest?


[12/14/2022 8:28 AM] mhs_sam#1471
Last time I checked, even the market cap of cardano's Apes was very close to ERG's market cap, which is ridiculous. I think a fully diluted 100mm is not much optimistic.


[12/14/2022 5:59 PM] Stacie#8189
Sure, we can forecast different scenarios of the price development.


[12/14/2022 6:02 PM] Stacie#8189
And we need to complete the payment for Eva. I have ERG725 left in the wallet. @Armeanio, please if you could send ERG577 to complete the payment.

Thank you

In addition, we need to send ERG1755 to MrStahlfelge for 2 weeks of December. 

@Armeanio, @kushti#0978, @morphic.

If it would be more convenient, you can send ERG in one tranche for December’s Salaries: ERG 60,446. 

Clarification is in the Accounting sheet

[12/27/2022 4:17 PM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti I think I must have said many times at least in different pieces but my proposal currently to approach budgeting is:
1)    Make some moderate cuts to expenses – some has been done already. Not sure anymore pending. If so, can be done and then posted here.
2)    Insure we get the SPF tokens – shouldn’t be an issue. Yasha has stated clearly the 3% is set aside for the EF.
3)    Decide vesting/disposal framework for SPF. I would have done up a proposal already but sick. But anyway, think its basically going to be 24 month vesting with gradual disposal over this period with some layered on complexity from Kusthi/MHS ideas. Communicate our ideas to SPF team so they know what we are planning. And can also mention here other ways we might be able to help SPF going forward. We need to announce the grant of SPF tokens from SPF at the right time when its finalized. Probably only minimal details disclosed but this should alleviate a lot of community concerns.
4)    Do a new burn sheet/scenario analysis based on this new assessment – probably won’t deviate much from the original one I did. If so, we take cautiously optimistic approach for now.
5)    Sit tight and pay bills for 60 days till March 1st, 2023 or 90 days till April 1, 2023. Then update everything and reassess.

I really don’t know what else to do besides above. There just too many moving parts like crypto market, Rosenbridge, IOG, SPF, investors, etc etc. Its crappy situation but there are also a lot of potential positive catalysts and everything can change quickly.

[12/27/2022 4:17 PM] Justin1000#9555
Mabye @Stacie can do a new sheet like the one @morphic had showing the expenses line by line before the cuts were made, the cuts made so far and the new current situation.


[12/27/2022 6:31 PM] Stacie#8189
Sure, Justin, will do that. I will get my off day on 3/1/2023 and prepare the sheet


[12/29/2022 11:51 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti You can find updated sheet here from Glasgow which incorporates the cuts to-date. It met the "Moderate Cut" amount (~12k ERG) I had earlier proposed. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sMoX34djjielB9i8Elw82QkpeT4xnMscqtx_A7bkNzM/edit#gid=813692145 per this https://www.ergoforum.org/t/treasury-burn-out-reduction-plan/4077/14, assumes that Mr. S is moved to part-time as was proposed by Glasgow in the Foundation channel forum proposal.

@kushti new burn sheet based on $1.20 price and the new "Moderate Cut" which are already done pending voting approval of new Mr. S payment. If calcs are right, this shows we got 18 months runway even at $1.20 and even with no SPF tokens and a full 32 months runway with SPF tokens and a relatively conservative assumption of $30mm valuation for SPF tokens. I think this is a good enough basis to leave budget cuts alone for now and focus on other things for the next 60-90 days. I don't know what others think?

[12/29/2022 11:59 AM] Justin1000#9555
**SPF**: Main thing will be getting the SPF tokens so making a proposal to them and getting final agreement on details from SPF team. We should aim to get proposal over to them within 2 weeks or less I think. I have sent another DM to Yasha reminding them to be careful about over regulating themselves and letting lawyers getting them tied into knots trying to comply with limitless possible future regulations. Hopefully, they will get the tokens out soon. The deadline set now in the seed agreement for TGE is** MARCH 1, 2023**.


[12/29/2022 12:01 PM] Justin1000#9555
**Rosenbridge**: Should try to secure funding ASAP. I will intro any VCs I can (supposed to have a few calls...would have already but got sick). If can't get actual token fund raised right away, I suggest not delaying things if can be avoided but launching with some sort of other mechanism like MHS mentioned and getting the bridge active to hopefully get more users/investors from Cardano.


[12/29/2022 12:02 PM] Justin1000#9555
**IOG**: @Armeanio  should continue to push them to take action sooner rather than later. Market is terrible and poor conditions are delaying a lot of projects and activity on Ergo I feel.


[12/29/2022 12:04 PM] Justin1000#9555
**Investors**: Will continue to push and target investors and add to list (starting to set up some calls now). Just can't count on this much in the short-run. Could work in short-run but it also could be something that pays a more long-term dividend. Impossible to predict...


[12/29/2022 12:06 PM] Justin1000#9555
Think that sums up my views on budgeting. Most things outside our control or only partially in our control but think we go with our current budget for 60-90 days and focus on those points above along with normal stuff like marketing.


[12/29/2022 10:47 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 @Stacie @glasgowm @Armeanio got into agreement with anon-real , as he recently done pretty successful fundraising, no need to send him 1000 ERG monthly from now

[01/05/2023 4:58 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah before the cuts. ie Robert hasn't been paid in a long time AFAIK so makes it look like more was cut than actually was.


[01/05/2023 6:42 PM] Stacie#8189
I took the situation from the moment I have started the work with ERGO.

If you prefer I can make for the period of time. In this case, please advise the starting point

Sorry, probably wasn't clear but I was just looking for an update for this sheet so we could update the burn scenario analysis: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sMoX34djjielB9i8Elw82QkpeT4xnMscqtx_A7bkNzM/edit#gid=813692145 and posted it to one of the forums.

@kushti please start new transfer for 30K ERGs. This is not for next salaries, but rather to have them at hand in the case of price spike. 
We have some kind of local bull run at the markets now. More likely a bull trap, but if the ERG price rise to $3-4 region would be stupid not to take advantage of it just because we are not prepared.


[02/02/2023 6:57 PM] mhs_sam#1471

Anastasiia @alex_slesarenko Hi Anastasiia 

We seek your urgent attention & assistance on this from Aleksandr because
the pro-rated service fees paid to us previously is for period covered up to: 

13 March 2023. 

If we go beyond the above date, we will need to continue pro-rate again for our services rendered till the company is officially struck off from the Registrar as this process takes at least another 4 to 5 months..

$500 SigUSD to 9fBsHLKBVbK7zd5kRv9wYDYiSECq18Zp9gjf9B14QpoSHXmuGhM for dev bounty. 

Not sure how you're currently handling bounties @kushti ? I never see people ask for them so assume you're speaking to them privately? I'll paste any I get in here. Then @Stacie can check to avoid double-spendings and send?

How much ERG are you actually selling though? For USDT.


[02/21/2023 1:08 PM] glasgowm#9381
Oh nm, I see it in the sheet. 2,836 total?


[02/21/2023 1:25 PM] Stacie#8189
No, 2,836 is the actual amount to be paid in USDT. If we are talking about the amount of ERG to be sold to cover USDT expense, it is ERG 1,593


[02/21/2023 1:26 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah I got that thanks, but is there other ERG to be sold for USDT outside of salary expenses (ie, MM payments, subscriptions, etc) ?


[02/21/2023 1:29 PM] Stacie#8189
For now - no as the rate is not so good still. That was the reason for the proposal to keep extra ERG in the common wallet to liquidate ERG once the rate reaches 3-4$ per ERG.


[02/21/2023 1:30 PM] Stacie#8189
And could you advise please aboutBenjamin: is he with us or not yet? I haven't seen any updates for 2023 in his time sheet.

pls check what docs i sent you a few months ago. i recall we should be getting a return of deposit from Le Yu for director role for one year or something (Maybe S$15k?). I think I was reimbursed for it by Foundation (pls confirm - probably i said in earlier emials) already so whoever takes that can then return equivalent after transaction expense to the Foundation. Or alternatively apply it to expenses to set up Dubai entity.


[02/26/2023 3:42 AM] Stacie#8189
Alright, I will look into it


[02/26/2023 10:54 PM] kushti#0978
Please try to mint SigUSD instead of dumping on exchanges whenever possible, and do not dump all at once


[02/27/2023 8:59 AM] Stacie#8189
If you can explain me, please, how to get SigUSD from ERG correctly, I will do that


[02/27/2023 9:03 AM] Stacie#8189
Or it is simple swiping?


[02/27/2023 11:39 AM] Stacie#8189
@Justin1000, kindly be informed that the deposit which was given as Nominee Director guarantee was $15,000.

And you were reimbursed for the payment to Singapore.

[03/01/2023 4:10 PM] Stacie#8189
@kushti, @morphic, due to reduced priced on ERG to complete salaries obligations we need to have additionally ERG5,000 for the payment to Morphic and GreenHat. Thank you


[03/02/2023 10:24 AM] kushti#0978
ok, will do later today . How, how much,  and when did you liquidate ERGs ?


[03/02/2023 10:27 AM] Stacie#8189
Liquidated:
- 1200 ERG on 28/02/2023 - salary for Angie (USDT 1836)
- 1200 ERG on 2/3/2023 - an outstanding balance from cNFTcon from last year for Dan

With the payment to Dan to settle salaries for this month we need to have ERG 6200


[03/02/2023 10:29 PM] kushti#0978
So 6200 is needed instead of 5000 ?


[03/03/2023 3:53 AM] Stacie#8189
Yes


[03/03/2023 4:48 AM] Justin1000#9555
Okay this is a Foundation issue...nothing to do with me personally. I suggest next week sometime (pls don't do right now as I just had a call with Ching), gently and politely ask them for the deposit back. They can send the money to my account since I paid originally and Foundation doesn't have bank account. The money can be applied in USD equiv at the time of transfer to 1) paying toward setting up next entity in Dubai or wherever or 2) striking off part of the $52.5k debt owed to me. I am okay to go with (1) given current situation of Foundation treasury. Hopefully they give it back with no issue. I think working with Le Yu has been really good experience overall (not like Dentons).


[03/04/2023 7:46 PM] Stacie#8189

How much BTC in Treasury? BTC price and dominance rising and Balaji has bet will be over 1 million in 90 days. I don't believe that but what we have in treasury could be very meaningful soon.

No, this is not for salaries. This amount we should always have in our wallet to make sure that we release ERG at the right price.

I haven’t calculated salaries yet. I will share it later

we have, was 9BTC but some was put into Kucoin @Justin1000


[03/20/2023 5:12 PM] Justin1000#9555
Ok, I think we should find out exactly how much it is and properly protect it. The BTC narrative very strong right now with macro fears becoming more prevalent and I think we could see bitcoin dominance rise to like 60% or even higher. Possible anyway. In that scenario, Ergo maybe forgotten in short-term but on the positive, with the BTC in treasury we maybe able to buy a top 3 exchange listing (Binance or Kraken).

👍 (3) 

[03/21/2023 12:17 PM] kushti#0978
the price at the moment of acquisition was ~$56K. As a reminder, I proposed to sell part of it but you was bullish on BTC back then so opposed. I think we need to consider next time liquidation strategy not depending on market sentiment.


[03/21/2023 1:35 PM] Justin1000#9555
Not sure I was bullish on btc or not but it was good to keep the treasury somewhat diversified.


[03/21/2023 1:36 PM] Justin1000#9555
I think we need to stay out of business of predicting prices or active asset management hence my efforts to automate the sale of spf and future token grants


[03/21/2023 1:37 PM] Justin1000#9555
But this btc stake maybe a little different. It's btc after all. But if it surges in value and we can make use of it would be nice. Good thing is it should be as good as usdt to a third party like exchange


[03/21/2023 1:39 PM] morphic#4133
@Justin1000, @kushti I think the easiest strategy is to create balanced portfolio (say BTC, ERG, SPF, USDT) and keep the balance. Like say BTC - 10%, ERG-50%, SPF-30%, USDT-10%. 
Then every month we can do rebalancing in the most optimal way.
This way we can do monthly spending from USDT part, and then top it up in order to restore the balance.

{Reactions}
👍🏻 

[03/21/2023 1:41 PM] morphic#4133
if some asset grows, it can be liquidated in favor of the other declined assets.


[03/21/2023 2:01 PM] Justin1000#9555
I think we should just sell all token grants per the liquidation program I made already. They are too risky and unestablished. We could make it even more simple if preferred. I have already made clear my view we sell those project tokens over time in a mechanical way to close to zero or leave some % that might be of use to us in helping the ecosystem (making markets or whatever )

Discretionary management should be confined to ERG. and btc probably qualifies as well. I am saying here if we see bitcoin dominance jump to 60 to 80 pct we can use it to buy a listing maybe. Alts probably follow at some point. And again not predicting this will happen but does look possible.


[03/21/2023 2:16 PM] morphic#4133
Yes, agree, I added SPF as an example, so I agree with your liquidation proposal. 
Can have balanced portfolio of BTC, ERG, USDT and then every month decide just on the percentages. Once they are decided, the subsequent action plan follows from that decision.


[03/21/2023 2:57 PM] Stacie#8189
I think it’s pretty good idea


[03/21/2023 3:04 PM] kushti#0978
There are a lot of good ideas expressed over past years, this one sounds good as well. Who is gonna work on that though


[03/21/2023 4:42 PM] Justin1000#9555
Work on what? It is just selling stuff. I think I have made my views crystal clear repeatedly. I took hours to draft the liquidation program. And I don’t care about any portfolio %...forget about that. Too complicated for us – we failed to even liquidate ERG at the right price when I said repeatedly we should.
-Any project tokens – sell down (**CONVERT TO ERG**) to near 10-20% of whatever given per the doc I already drafted. I already made a model for it. If that is too complicated, just do 30 months and 10% remaining regardless of any ERG price/token etc. Still need to think about when to start the program though. You cannot dump SPF or RSN when they are just launching.
-The only thing we manage discretionary is ERG, BITCOIN AND USDT. We don’t have many BTC so probably its just a question of when we liquidate ERG – we should be able to manage that - just tell the market maker when to sell and give them the ERGs. its pretty simple. 
-Custodian: As I also made very clear, it is important in the long-term to have a custodian to manage assets and their disposal. They can convert to anything at a simple instruction. AND they can keep it SAFE. For example if you sell $2mm worth of ERG, then the USDT goes to the custodian and we don't have to worry about it.

@kushti , you really have enough to worry about already. The only thing here I think you need concern yourself is if you want to liquidate project tokens in a certain way. Like you said with SPF. Well in that case the tokens go to you on a monthly basis to put in the grid or whatever it is you want to do and you sell them. Else, just give them every month to Stacie to dump on market on a daily basis or something. I don’t have the answer for that but important to minimize market impact.


[03/21/2023 4:42 PM] Justin1000#9555
Feel like I am repeating myself at this point. If someone else has a better idea can do it and put to a vote.  I have given my views many times.


[03/21/2023 8:26 PM] morphic#4133
We already voted and decided that @Stacie will do regular liquidations to have enough USDT and SigUSD in advance to pay monthly expenses. Today on the call she confirmed, so this task is on her now. 
@Stacie, don't hesitate to post gentle reminders here daily until you get what is necessary to execute. And keep a track record of the liquidations. Also, as you do liquidations and once the amount of ERGs you have drops below 10K, request a new transfer of 30K.


[03/22/2023 3:43 AM] Justin1000#9555
Okay. @kushti yes sorry there is indeed an execution issue in disposal of project tokens per the mechanism I suggested. I mentioned this in the very beginning and wondered if it might be possible to do is some automated way where each month we just dump the designated amount of tokens to be sold  in a contract or something and they are converted to ERG via Dex on a daily basis for a month. You mentioned grids yourself but I don't know if that is most time efficient for you and effective. Someone like Stacie or one of us converting project tokens (SPF, RSN etc) on daily basis for erg seems highly inefficient though.


[03/22/2023 6:17 PM] Stacie#8189
Hi everyone. I have prepared the sample of ERG liquidation sheet. Please, have a look if anything else should be added.

👍 

[03/23/2023 3:35 PM] Stacie#8189
Also, I was thinking: in the proposal which Justin prepared there is a price of ERG 3$ and 4$. What do you think if ERG reaches 2.5$ we sell ERG5,000 to have some USDT balance?


[03/23/2023 9:10 PM] morphic#4133
I think by default you can sell in a regular time intervals with small orders to always have a reserve for next month in advance. 
For example if you sell sell every day 100 ERGs you will liquidate 3000 per month, so probably you need to sell about 300 ERGs per day or 600 ERGs every two days.
It is really hard to time the market, nobody can do that predictably, so simple regular liquidation will give a good average price. 
What we want to avoid is to sell at lower than average prices just because we don't have reserves.
When price spikes like 30-40% it make sense to sell 500-600 ERGs right away, in addition to regular selling.


[03/24/2023 6:42 AM] Stacie#8189
Got it and agree with that


[03/27/2023 7:06 AM] Stacie#8189
@everyone, please be informed that in our common wallet we have:
- ERG 36,072;
- SigUSD 121.9;
- USDT 4,656

For March 2023 we are expecting to complete following salary payments (calculated with the price 1 ERG = 1.52 USD):
- ERG Paid - 16,209;
- ERG liquidated - 26,076.

Total ERG 42,285.

@kushti, @morphic, please assist with co-signing of the amount to pay salaries for March. 

Thank you

@kushti, @morphic - gentle reminder about salaries tranche 🙏🏻


[03/28/2023 4:00 PM] kushti#0978
Where is this voted on?


[03/28/2023 4:12 PM] morphic#4133
There was this voting https://www.ergoforum.org/t/40k-ergs-to-treasury-wallet-for-liquidation-pending-price-targets/4202
Not exactly the same words, but the same goal.


[03/28/2023 4:19 PM] kushti#0978
Will you sell 26k erg for usdt???


[03/28/2023 4:20 PM] mhs_sam#1471
the vote implies that if price >3 and >4 however.


[03/28/2023 4:22 PM] morphic#4133
yes, but we need to have a reserve to wait for the better price.


[03/28/2023 4:22 PM] glasgowm#9381
No this is people paid in a USDT base-rate. They're still paid in ERG, but amount varies with price so it's down as 'Liquidated'. 

Confusing wording I agree, actual ERG sold for USDT is very little


[03/28/2023 4:22 PM] Stacie#8189
Yes, that’s true


[03/28/2023 4:23 PM] mhs_sam#1471
You're right and I agree, but it needs another vote.


[03/28/2023 4:23 PM] morphic#4133
@Stacie could you please create a vote for the liquidation process (based on what I wrote above)


[03/28/2023 4:24 PM] Stacie#8189
But we have ERG and non-ERG payments, hence, whatever is paid in non-ERG will be in the field of ERG-liquidated


[03/28/2023 4:24 PM] Stacie#8189
Sure, I will do that


[03/28/2023 4:26 PM] Stacie#8189
And the majority of this amount is Raffles payment - $22,700. March payment is the last for the project


[03/28/2023 4:28 PM] Stacie#8189
In majority of payments, if the salary needs to be paid in SigUSD, for instance, I send equivalent in ERG; and this transaction depends on the ERG price, hence, it will be also ERG liquidated


[03/29/2023 8:41 AM] Stacie#8189
@kushti, @morphic, just a reminder for the salaries tranche🙏🏻


[03/29/2023 4:13 PM] kushti#0978
I am away from access to a key till Fri. @morphic can initiate payment but never doing that for unclear reasons. But you can start payments, last time you asked for additional transfer few days after starting payments


[03/29/2023 4:19 PM] Stacie#8189
Yes, I will start sending salaries; I asked for additional tranche as the price dropped.

@morphic, if you can initiate the process would be great as I don’t want to spend ERG which we have for liquidation for salaries


[03/29/2023 9:06 PM] morphic#4133
1) I don't know why @kushti thinks I can initiate, I never did it.
2) Even if I did, still kushti's signature is necessary, once he is back and initiate, I will sign shortly after him as I always do. 
I suggest to do it the usual way.


[03/30/2023 6:34 AM] Stacie#8189
Hi @everyone.
I have prepared proposal “ERG liquidation - additional procedure” for voting.

Should be arrived, please check


[04/04/2023 6:00 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Stacie can you pls follow up with Leyu and ask them current status of strike off and if they can refund the deposit of S$15k to my account? I will then convert to USD and let everyone know the final amount refunded (if we get any) and it can be used to strike off a portion of the $52.5k debt from before. Then we can decide later how we are going to pay for next entity set-up.


[04/04/2023 8:15 AM] Stacie#8189
Sure, Justin, I will check with them

21/6 - 21/8 - strike off will happen during this time frame


[04/04/2023 9:45 AM] Stacie#8189
@kushti, @morphic, please kindly send more ERG to keep in the wallet as now we spent all ERG which we had in the wallet for salaries and there will be nothing left for the liquidation as was decided based on Justin’s proposal.

And I think it is wise to keep ERG and liquidate when the price is rIght. 

Please, kindly initiate the tranche of ERG40,000.

Thank you

[04/12/2023 6:03 PM] morphic#4133
@kushti, please don't ignore. I still not received salary for March because Stacie has not enough ERGs to make all payments and I usually the last in line (for some reason) for the payments.

[04/14/2023 12:01 PM] kushti#0978
@Stacie 15k withdrawal done, can you mint sigusd ?


[04/14/2023 12:01 PM] Stacie#8189
Yes, I can


[04/14/2023 12:03 PM] kushti#0978
So I guess minting for the whole amt would be better than dumping for USDT


[04/14/2023 12:10 PM] Stacie#8189
I believe we should keep some amount in ERG, USDT and SigUSD as we have payment in multiple currencies


[04/14/2023 12:11 PM] kushti#0978
Currently the bank is open, so good chance to mint sigusd, and after hackathon payments you will have sigusd for next month I guess


[04/14/2023 12:12 PM] kushti#0978
And no more than that


[04/14/2023 12:13 PM] morphic#4133
yes, it is better you do daily sell with small amounts. Especially when the price at $2.


[04/14/2023 12:13 PM] Stacie#8189
Understood


[04/14/2023 12:14 PM] Stacie#8189
Agree with that. But I believe we need to get voting done first


[04/14/2023 12:14 PM] kushti#0978
SigUSD is better in fixing anything above $1K . Then it is always possible to get back in Erg or slowly liquidate


[04/14/2023 12:20 PM] morphic#4133
not sure. At which price you sold ERGs for the recent salary?


[04/14/2023 12:22 PM] Stacie#8189
I was selling small amount daily at the best price I could get


[04/14/2023 12:22 PM] kushti#0978
@Stacie arrived, please mint. You can send me in sigusd for servers btw


[04/14/2023 12:23 PM] Stacie#8189
Alright, will do that after work

Hi everyone,

Sorry, was not able to join today - I was at work


[04/19/2023 12:44 PM] kushti#0978
Any progress on that ?


[04/19/2023 4:29 PM] morphic#4133
There are two ways to do this: 
1) wait until multisig is implemented in Mobile wallet (this is WIP now) 
2) based on the distrib branch we usually use for withdrawal you can somehow setup a correct transaction which we will then sign as usual.


[04/24/2023 1:30 PM] Stacie#8189
@everyone, please be informed that in our common wallet we have:
- ERG70;
- SigUSD 1,100;
- USDT 1.26;
- GUP 312$

For April 2023 we are expecting to complete following salary payments (calculated with the price 1 ERG = 1.64 USD):
- ERG Paid - 16,469;
- ERG liquidated - 9,412.

Total ERG 25,881.

@kushti, @morphic, please assist with co-signing of the amount to pay salaries for April. 

Thank you

EF Treasury + Balances on exchanges/MM + MultiSig

- BTC Amount unclear. 1.5 on the MM, added 3 from gate but unsure of exact number. (9 minus whatever was spent on kucoin listing)
- Wouldn't let me add USDT for some reason hence using USDC

[04/27/2023 12:13 AM] kushti#0978
Were BTCs used on listing? I guess MM only


[04/27/2023 12:13 AM] kushti#0978
Some BTCs still on fmfw MM account


[04/27/2023 12:13 AM] kushti#0978
and btw ~12K USDT there


[04/27/2023 12:14 AM] kushti#0978
so I guess 9 BTC minus possible MM losses by Kairon but need to check

[04/27/2023 1:16 AM] Justin1000#9555
Didn't we lose MM funds at Hotbit? This was last report I got from July 9, 2022. 0.40 BTC there as of then and might have been more orginally before adjusted into other assets. Don't recall what was originally deposited. Anyway, I got these daily reports every day up until the hack or whatever and then stopped. But that could explain ~0.5-1.0 BTC loss. Not aware we ever got anything back.


[04/27/2023 11:27 PM] kushti#0978
Hotbit was before we got btc from the deal


[04/27/2023 11:29 PM] kushti#0978
MM is out control it seems


[04/27/2023 11:30 PM] kushti#0978
MM on Huobi not working since Jan


[04/27/2023 11:30 PM] kushti#0978
Because of expired keys


[04/27/2023 11:31 PM] kushti#0978
Coinls contract expiration will be another surprise I guess


[04/27/2023 11:33 PM] kushti#0978
Dunno what is going on on HotBit


[04/27/2023 11:34 PM] kushti#0978
No one is working on all these things


[04/28/2023 5:24 AM] Justin1000#9555
I am not invovled in any MM. But nothing to do on hotbit I think. I already asked for money back or at least a BTC pair...they ignored my request and asked for more money for btc pair so seems clear they won't return it. They do their own MM and have been making okay volume. Think just move on.


[04/28/2023 5:27 AM] Justin1000#9555
But I share your concerns on MM. Thought with  coinls, would get kucoin and huobi and any new exchanges all going strong but huobi volume down to near 0. And nothing ever got started at gate even when I got the account updated to VIP status (think was before coinls though).
-If won't do MM on Huobi can I get my $52.5k back now provided specifiically for MM? If we are going to get MM started on Huobi, do we need the full $52.5k or can I get part back now? Has been forever already and seems we don't need it if not using. 
-Suggest making sure Coinls is doing something on Kucoin/Huobi. Else we are wasting money paying them. 

Probably Gate too but I have no idea our current account status or if will upgrade us again.


[04/28/2023 5:52 AM] Justin1000#9555
If Coinls is not even doing MM on Huobi, are they doing anything? Is all our volume just organic on the major exchanges? If so, maybe we don't need them but note the Huobi is looking at delisting tokens below <$50k a day volume. I doubt will delist Ergo given probably see it has potential but can't rule it out.


[04/29/2023 1:04 AM] kushti#0978
They are doing KuCoin. Sent them new Huobi key just.


[04/29/2023 1:16 AM] kushti#0978
Huobi acc currently has $54.4K USDT + 18.2K ERG


[04/29/2023 1:16 AM] kushti#0978
what are mm deposit conditions ?


[04/29/2023 2:32 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Armeanio Maybe armeanio can recap the situation. I am happy to leave it all there if needed until we get the price back up. But if some can be repaid to me that would be nice too.

Main thing tho is fix the volume on Huobi ASAP. We need to be over $50k a day at minimum. Thanks


[04/29/2023 11:42 AM] CW#8500
Hey @Stacie can you please send 150 ERG to the following address sometime in the next couple of days. These are rewards for the cross chain poker tournament. Thanks!

@Stacie  EVA this month: 1000/1.643 = 608.64 ERGs + 180.0132 ERGs for normal community stuff to cover 6 months per attached sheet. = total of **788.653 ERGs.**
