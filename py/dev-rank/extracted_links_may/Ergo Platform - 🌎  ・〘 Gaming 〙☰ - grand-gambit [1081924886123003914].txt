Add cypx to the speed pot


[03/07/2023 11:54 PM] ABCLend#0000

(re @ABCLend : *Wait you say that ios doesn‚Äôt work, but it let me add CYPX then sign a war transaction. No animation though*) 
 
 Yes it works with certain actions, and with plays it will work sometimes (if using speed pot and the game isn't roulette) even tho animation isn't triggered


[03/07/2023 11:57 PM] Grand_Gambit#0000
But it is easier to say it doesnt work than to explain all that and have a bad UX for iPhone, I have to find a way to make it work, if I only allowed speedy plays it would be much easier


[03/07/2023 11:58 PM] Grand_Gambit#0000
I will ask the community at some point if I should just remove the option of betting without speed pot and playing with raw funds leaving users' wallet which gives a worse User Experience and also makes my work harder

So I remember hearing about this strategy where you gamble on a 50/50 game. You always bet on the same side so if it‚Äôs coin flip always on heads or tails. If you win you keep going at 1 erg, if you lose you double up to 2erg, if you win you go back to 1 erg, if you lose though you go to 4erg, etc‚Ä¶ so if you lose again you go to 8erg and as long as you have enough float you‚Äôll likely never lose enough in a row to go broke and your profit is the 1ergs you win straight away. Anyways I lost 23erg ü•π

[04/10/2023 12:16 PM] Grand_Gambit#0000
Just like in normal casinos, plinko is such a fast game I think people should always use speed pot, in fact I would like to have speed pot being the only way of playing in the whole casino, makes development much easier, and also user experience much better

[04/11/2023 11:44 AM] HelixEvo#0000
(re @koutelier : *Why?*)
        
        Somewhere on backend you are keeping balances of everyones address? If jacked, someone could increase a speed bots balance?

        Yes


[04/11/2023 11:50 AM] Grand_Gambit#0000
That is why speed pot limits were low so that some crazy mfer didnt deposit like 10k ERG and some other mfer hacked it or whatever


[04/11/2023 11:51 AM] Grand_Gambit#0000
Security should be just fine, there are also ways to do the speed pot without a centralized backend too, but that is just for the future

It is being privately tested.

I assume it's the same odds of winning if I play 5 single ball games, or one 5 ball game?


[05/01/2023 1:48 PM] Grand Gambit#0000
yes the same odds


[05/01/2023 1:48 PM] bunny#0000
also, does the ball speed setting affect anything, or is it just visual?


[05/01/2023 1:50 PM] Grand Gambit#0000
it is just visual, but sometimes when speeding the ball, it falls to a different bucket than what the result actually returns and shows on the results table, e.g it could fall on the 0.5 multiplier but in reality it should have fallen to the 1.1 one, or viceversa, the table showing results is always the one showing the true results

however, i think i fixed all of those visual bugs after fighting for a few days against every ball interaction


[05/01/2023 1:50 PM] Grand Gambit#0000
if u encounter one of those please let me know


[05/01/2023 1:50 PM] Hekek#0000
sometimes the animations never plays


[05/01/2023 1:51 PM] Grand Gambit#0000
dang it, can you open the console of the browser and tell if there is any error showing there? thought i fixed that


[05/01/2023 1:52 PM] Grand Gambit#0000
it is a minor bug as it simply doesnt receive the play, and nothing happens, so dont worry about lost tokens, but I have to get that fixed asap


[05/01/2023 1:52 PM] Grand Gambit#0000
thanks for the warning @Hekek


[05/01/2023 1:52 PM] Hekek#0000
had to refresh the browser, if it happens again i will send you the log


[05/01/2023 1:52 PM] Grand Gambit#0000
thank you a lot

also to explain how the odds work, basically for each row the server has a 50% chance of telling the ball to go right, and a 50% chance of telling the ball to go left.

Therefore it is hard for the ball to reach the corners multipliers, as it would have to return e.g "right" several times, which would cause the chances to go 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5.... (0.5^rows).

Which ends up in a very low percentage of actually happening, so manage your risks guys, have fun but be cautious, it is a very addicting game


[05/01/2023 2:03 PM] Hekek#0000
@Grand Gambit  should i open a ticket?


[05/01/2023 2:03 PM] Grand Gambit#0000
Sure do it to keep the general chat clean üôÇ


[05/01/2023 2:18 PM] bunny#0000
Damn, Plinko is fun af


[05/01/2023 2:19 PM] bunny#0000
I think I just found the best use case for my Comet üòÖ


[05/01/2023 2:19 PM] Grand Gambit#0000
fun == dangerous tho


[05/01/2023 2:19 PM] Grand Gambit#0000
oh okay if it is using comet then no worries, worthless token as they claim


[05/01/2023 2:19 PM] Grand Gambit#0000
hahaha


[05/01/2023 2:19 PM] bunny#0000
it's basically air!


[05/01/2023 2:22 PM] bunny#0000
I think you could even lower the min bet in some places (if possible), I really only play for fun so I'm not degenerate enough to bet 1 Erg as min bet üòÖ


[05/01/2023 2:23 PM] Grand Gambit#0000
first person to claim not being a degen


[05/01/2023 2:23 PM] Grand Gambit#0000
and you own comet? wow


[05/01/2023 2:23 PM] bunny#0000
lmao


[05/01/2023 2:24 PM] bunny#0000
But I think $0.20 (min bet) seems to be pretty standard across online casinos, something to keep in mind


[05/01/2023 2:26 PM] Grand Gambit#0000
I will add it to todo list


[05/01/2023 2:26 PM] Grand Gambit#0000
thanks buny
