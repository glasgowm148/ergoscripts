The BPSAA communications ring is almost complete, waiting on sentinel


[08/02/2020 10:51 PM] <Pistol | etho.pink>#0000
Well i have an exciting tomorrow. I ordered a RX 5700 XT 8GB and my 5500 XT 8GB is replacing the aging XFX RX 570 4GB that is in my rig. So im down to 6 4GB cards to be replaced with 8GB cards! Its time to expand and maybe by the end of the year i will have 1GH/s of ETHASH mining!


[08/02/2020 10:52 PM] <Pistol | etho.pink>#0000
AND AND ---- i sold the XFX and 2 broken 4GB RX 570's for $50 plus cost to ship


[08/02/2020 10:52 PM] <Pistol | etho.pink>#0000
5GH/s is my goal and i can live off crypto profits !


[08/02/2020 10:52 PM] <Black_Turtle>#0000
How does this bot work


[08/02/2020 10:53 PM] <Black_Turtle>#0000
Does it send from bpsaa to here and from here to bpsaa?


[08/02/2020 10:53 PM] <greywolf || Polarity.Exchange |#0000

neat huh?


[08/02/2020 10:53 PM] <Draeth - Project Lead/HR>#0000
basically it uses webhooks for a speific channel in each discord (and the bpsaa telegram) and relays messages


[08/02/2020 10:53 PM] <cryptorev>#0000
What about gifs


[08/02/2020 10:53 PM] <Black_Turtle>#0000
So what discord is connected here?


[08/02/2020 10:53 PM] <wolfofwaves>#0000
all discords tied to bpsaa channel


[08/02/2020 10:53 PM] <wolfofwaves>#0000
and vice versa


[08/02/2020 10:54 PM] <Draeth - Project Lead/HR>#0000
so far, pirate, tn, ether-1 and ergo's discord, along with the bpsaa tg, are connected


[08/02/2020 10:54 PM] <wolfofwaves>#0000

[08/03/2020 11:27 PM] <Black_Turtle>#0000
Is this a public group? If so we might need to be carefull with these talks (re @cryptorev: anyone know how herb can get a bunch of new phone numbers to resurrect his army of telegram shills? They cracked down on his old ones.)


[08/03/2020 11:28 PM] <cryptorev>#0000
yes it's public - that's the point of it


[08/03/2020 11:29 PM] <wolfofwaves>#0000

Bot army's or telegram shills can hurt us if some public people report this stuff, since they are both illegal for the rules

it's just for herb

[08/04/2020 4:13 AM] <CaptainDraeth>#0000
Should I announce the BPSAA telegram on Twitter tomorrow?


[08/04/2020 4:14 AM] <CaptainDraeth>#0000
Our should I wait a few days


[08/04/2020 4:20 AM] <cryptorev>#0000
we still have the opportunity to revert this back to a private group for us all to simply have a central hub for essential and other communication within the BPSAA


[08/04/2020 4:20 AM] <cryptorev>#0000
so now would be the time to debate the merits of either approach


[08/04/2020 4:22 AM] <cryptorev>#0000
i, for one, feel like this chat room is kind of special - it's the first time i have seen multiple different projects all connected through discords under a common banner


[08/04/2020 4:22 AM] <cryptorev>#0000
so keeping it invite only might at least allow us to preserve its authenticity


[08/04/2020 4:23 AM] <cryptorev>#0000
there's a sort of inspirational comraderie vibe i get with this place (re @cryptorev: i, for one, feel like this chat room is kind of special - it's the first time i have seen multiple different projects all connected through discords under a common banner)


[08/04/2020 4:26 AM] <CaptainDraeth>#0000

[08/04/2020 4:28 AM] <CaptainDraeth>#0000
i'll hold off on announcing then


[08/04/2020 6:13 AM] <cryptorev>#0000
I moved the group to private status on telegram for the time being. Here is the invite link to share.

[08/04/2020 6:33 AM] <Draeth - Project Lead/HR>#0000
Honestly I think we should make it public

All private convos can be had in the BPSAA discord or via DMs


[08/04/2020 6:35 AM] <Draeth - Project Lead/HR>#0000
After giving it some thought, it makes more sense to have a public tg


[08/04/2020 6:36 AM] <cryptorev>#0000
Private doesn't mean only members can join


[08/04/2020 6:41 AM] <cryptorev>#0000

[08/04/2020 6:42 AM] <Draeth - Project Lead/HR>#0000

Yeah it's just not indexed (re @BPSAA_CommsBot: <Draeth - Project Lead/HR> That's its join by link only?)


[08/04/2020 6:49 AM] <cryptorev>#0000
Nobody can search for it if it's private.


[08/04/2020 6:49 AM] <Draeth - Project Lead/HR>#0000
Ah


[08/04/2020 7:17 AM] <filippounits>#0000
why not maintain this @bpsaa private as cross-chat for teams members only and create another public one i.e. @bpsaaofficial ?


[08/04/2020 6:58 PM] <CaptainDraeth>#0000
We have a private discord for team members only, so there isn't a real need for a team member only tg (re @filippounits: why not maintain this @bpsaa private as cross-chat for teams members only and create another public one i.e. @bpsaaofficial ?)


[08/04/2020 6:58 PM] <cryptorev>#0000
Should we make the bpsaa telegram invite only or public?

Do you keep missing all the **Uniswap** action and are you never able to get in at the bottom or the best price? Then you should participate in the **Hedge Protocol (HEDGE)** presale deal that starts in a few hours. Spaces are limited and you get almost **20% bonus** on the listing price, which means you are instantly in profit.

HEDGE is the newest Uniswap gem that is building a very specialized new DeFi protocol by using Chainlink oracles. There are a lot of DeFi scams going around, but this one has the technology to back it up!

Have you heard about **Hedge Protocol (HEDGE)**? It‚Äôs the newest **Uniswap DeFi** project that has their presale tonight! They are the first of its kind Decentralized Insurance Protocol that offers protection against smart contract hacks, stolen assets and exit scams through a peer-to-peer insurance market place. 

Presale participants will receive a **16.67% bonus**, which means you invest in this hot project at only a $75k valuation! I‚Äôm sending this message because of the invite contest, but I think HEDGE can easily go 10x-15x after their launch tonight!

They are also doing an airdrop to drop 0.1% of the entire supply of TN, the gas needed to operate their underlying platform structure.
For context: if the 100th biggest coin airdropped 0.1% of their supply that airdrop would be worth almost $90k

Looking into getting a telegram support group set up for the soul tribe. Is there a spambot one could use that prompts every new user to enter a password? That way we can give the password out privately but still have a public custom link.

In regards to the TN node code, which we discussed during the BPSAA meeting yesterday. And on suggestion from @scalahub 
https://github.com/TurtleNetwork/TurtleNetwork
We got 2 test suites that we don't understand why they are broken.
1) DataTransactionBodyBytesByteVectorSuite => if you run  'sbt node-it/docker' and then 'sbt node-it/testOnly *.DataTransactionBodyBytesByteVectorSuite'
Gives following error:
Cause: com.wavesplatform.it.api.UnexpectedStatusCodeException: Request: POST http://localhost:32769/transactions/broadcast; Unexpected status code (400): {"error":307,"message":"Transaction is not allowed by account-script","transaction":{"type":12,"id":"8sKPGSggNoxyubSVDvzYprPFdj19EZp5XUvkW9rU6vQD","sender":"3HhwWXZ6XKcZLtnaHpswiZi8Pfqy4LVu6ui","senderPublicKey":"5sUrfKpNqnRBjhWPN7smE1kdeZBBuCMriQR84VyNWhB6","fee":330000000,"feeAssetId":null,"timestamp":1600691549463,"proofs":["4ALG7BGPzL5NSKrhw4HbwcfusXxABtLuWdfYBcvFmHtYEhSddPbE9S5ce8UkddtQMXcV9TxMe6Pm72vBEfJ1S9uY"],"version":2,"chainId":73,"data":[{"key":"a","type":"binary",

What should happen: it should be allowed and all tests from this suite should pass

hope someone can look at it. Can you link to the file that is giving problem and maybe more details (like the error with which the test is failing)

SponsorshipDiffTest => running : 'sbt testOnly *.SponsorshipDiffTest'

GIves following error:

[info]     Location: (SponsorshipDiffTest.scala:264)

What we however expect is that the tx fails since we pay to few fee

If I got it right it has to do with BLOCKV5 feature. If I would remove this activation from the test then the sponsorshipdifftest does work completly, 
Xucito also looked at it but has no clue yet.

I don't know how expensive it is to use bucaneer, but I think BPSAA needs to get the community involved with some monetary incentive, and bucaneer is one solution that works. The power of it should be harnessed by all BPSAA members.

Polarity has a large selection of fees it collects from sponsored assets to the gateway fee structure. This doesn‚Äôt begin to account for the future products and services we are developing.

[10/14/2020 9:03 PM] <Draeth - Project Lead/HR>#0000

Thank you.


[10/14/2020 9:23 PM] <cryptorev>#0000
depends on the nature of security in the wallet; non-cold storage is a pretty wide selection of different wallet types (re @ElvaQi: Beginner question: what are your thoughts on using cold storage wallets vs. hot storage wallets?)

I want all of our BPSaa members to succeed and I am willing to risk a great deal of capital to make it successful... I have mined 1000 coins of pirate from the start a day until 200 a day and I üíØ think it‚Äôs the wave of the future and this great alliance... but we need marketing and capital....

[10/18/2020 2:38 AM] <CaptainDraeth>#0000
where was this review? 
Also, I absolutely agree in regards to marketing. I am about to drop $3000 on setting up the non-profit so that we can start accepting donations and grants, which will allow us to properly market ourselves once we have some funding rolling in


[10/18/2020 2:39 AM] <hugaum>#0000

Yes, @PayPal's announcement is great for adoption, but if most of it's features are limited, what's the difference?

Decentralization
Privacy
Limitless transactions
Controlled supply
Permissionless
Transparent

@PayPal's "crypto" has none

Burst coin works based on proof of space?


[11/30/2020 12:25 PM] <Tinmans>#0000
What do you do with the space?


[11/30/2020 12:27 PM] <Exlo of $ETHO since Oct'18>#0000
Proof of capacity (PoC)


[11/30/2020 12:27 PM] <Nivok Spilkommen>#0000
It's proof of capacity, it's not as many people believe just filling up hardrives with useless data, the space is used to pre-compute nonces to make up blocks, so it is proof of work only the work is done once when the plots are first formed and then used as a look up table instead of calculating the nonces every round like traditional PoW cons.


[11/30/2020 12:29 PM] <Tinmans>#0000
Thanks. Sounds like a time-memory tradeoff algorithm where more memory equates to less time in processing, i presume?


[11/30/2020 12:30 PM] <Tinmans>#0000
But assuming the memory is fast enough like Nvme


[11/30/2020 12:32 PM] <Tinmans>#0000
I get the idea. Thanks!


[11/30/2020 1:06 PM] <Nivok Spilkommen>#0000
The way I look at it, it's like using a lookup table rather than calculating a result every time.  Saves orders of magnetude of power comsumption when compared to bitcoin.


[11/30/2020 1:17 PM] <ohager>#0000
No fast hard-drive necessary. As @Nivok said: it's merely like a huge look up table. This way no big entry barrier for miners and though favors decentralization. (re @Tinmans: But assuming the memory is fast enough like Nvme)


[11/30/2020 1:21 PM] <Nivok Spilkommen>#0000
With the current 4min block times there is plenty of time to submit your nonces so no expensive hardware required, I mine with a Raspberry Pi and a couple of redundant usb drives.


[11/30/2020 1:43 PM] <Tinmans>#0000
I see. Ok. (re @ohager: No fast hard-drive necessary. As @Nivok said: it's merely like a huge look up table. This way no big entry barrier for miners and though favors decentralization.)

What's Wrong with Signal, Whatsapp, Telegram, Protonmail, Tutanota?
Some are quick to promote apps as being safe for your use just because they are encrypted. I will talk about how many of the popular apps that are commonly thought to be safe because of encryption are...

[12/11/2020 6:19 AM] <+dreamTim - Marketing/SEO>#0000
you are right about this
we use certain social channels due to their popularity, not because of their encryption
at the same time, we try and support alternative social media platforms such as flote and mastodon
we are also planning to launch a group in keybase


[12/11/2020 6:19 AM] <Xair>#0000
fair enough, although I would advise against keybase, it seems to have similar issues as telegram and was recently bought out by another company


[12/11/2020 6:19 AM] <Xair>#0000
mastodon is neat though


[12/11/2020 6:20 AM] <Xair>#0000
federated systems are usually good :p


[12/11/2020 6:20 AM] <+dreamTim - Marketing/SEO>#0000
i know, right? zoom bought them, but from an encryption perspective is hard to find something that matches keybase


[12/11/2020 6:20 AM] <+dreamTim - Marketing/SEO>#0000
we do support this aspect


[12/11/2020 6:20 AM] <Xair>#0000
ahh yeah, I mean keybase just makes public key crypto super easy, so I understand that


[12/11/2020 6:21 AM] <Xair>#0000
I am bias because I spend 90% of my day inside terminals lol

[12/11/2020 6:21 AM] <+dreamTim - Marketing/SEO>#0000
actually we have discussed for all members of the BPSAA to have a presence in the fediverse


[12/11/2020 6:21 AM] <+dreamTim - Marketing/SEO>#0000
we do like pgp, and we are also looking to develop more tools that help us communicate safely


[12/11/2020 6:22 AM] <+dreamTim - Marketing/SEO>#0000
pirate chain has such a project in place


[12/11/2020 6:22 AM] <+dreamTim - Marketing/SEO>#0000
also communicating via memos in our wallets provides very high encryption
the memo is sent on the blockchain, and can only be decrypted by the receipient of the transaction


[12/11/2020 6:23 AM] <+dreamTim - Marketing/SEO>#0000
so its possibly as safe and as powerful as pgp

there is a new project that will make the sending and receiving of highly encrypted messages even easier


[12/11/2020 6:35 AM] <Xair>#0000
I guess memos on the blockchain would work pretty decently


[12/11/2020 6:35 AM] <+dreamTim - Marketing/SEO>#0000
instead of pgp, it will utilise zk-snarks


[12/11/2020 6:37 AM] <Xair>#0000
does that project exist yet?


[12/11/2020 6:38 AM] <Xair>#0000
I would be interested in how you build secure chat systems with zk-snarks


[12/11/2020 6:38 AM] <+dreamTim - Marketing/SEO>#0000
yes, it is an active project for pirate chain


[12/11/2020 6:39 AM] <Xair>#0000
nice


[12/11/2020 7:15 AM] <Xair>#0000
if you could send me a link about that zk-snarks chat system it would be cool tim, I am a little busy right now but will definitely look into it


[12/11/2020 7:25 AM] <+dreamTim - Marketing/SEO>#0000
sorry no link yet, all work in progress at the moment


[12/11/2020 7:34 AM] <Xair>#0000
fair enough, anywhere I can read about it?


[12/11/2020 7:34 AM] <Xair>#0000

It's simple, here's a totally random example, BTDEX, I use that to make cross chain trades, in the case of a dispute it's way easier to check what happened on a open chain, so greater peace of mind.  If I want to trade regularly, it is i my interests that anybody can check my transaction history and see that I am honest and reliable.  Sometimes the need to establish trust is more important than keeping things hidden.  Actually it should be that way most of the time IMO.

[12/13/2020 1:36 PM] <Tinmans>#0000
There is another side to it. Say you accumulated 100k $ and its all visible to every one on the chain. 
Further, say they are able to link your wallet id to your real identity.
A  bunch of thugs break in to your place and demand to transfer all that money to their wallet.


[12/13/2020 1:39 PM] <Tinmans>#0000
There was a case in 2018 or 2019 where a russian kid live streamed a lot of crypto money in his account to his viewers. Some body recognized him and knew were he lived, a group of masked men broke into his apartment, punched him in the face and took his money.

Being honest isn't same as being sheep. The wolves and vultures are circling.

You make a good point. It's one of the many reasons why I don't stream.

Exposing wealth put you always on risk. Here in Brazil it's common to be assaulted just because you have a more or less luxury car. My kids are not allowed to publish on tiktok, yt, insta, Fb and others...

I can add fact to that as well, I grew up with a lday who it was very common for families to be abducted for yrs at a time for ransom where she was from, her parents were held for 3 yrs for ransom.  they were only mildly wealthy


[12/13/2020 7:04 PM] <theekgb - Dev>#0000
they also grew up learnign to make sure they appear less fortunate


[12/13/2020 9:33 PM] <Societus>#0000
Privacy by default is definitely important for many use cases, but a trustless economy only works between those who have shown some way of determining trust in advance (buying online in an impossible to trace currency, on a platform with no auditing system, with untrusted sellers [initially] is a very slow, cautious, and expensive to enter, economy. There will always be a place for transparent coins, as long as the option of privacy still exists.


[12/14/2020 7:03 AM] <Xair>#0000
yes, this is a core concept of the transparent transactions in zcash based on zk-snarks, you can transact in cleartext by choice after mixing your coins with shielded transfers


[12/14/2020 7:04 AM] <Xair>#0000
it creates an infinitely complex network of internal transactions which makes tracing even a clear text transfer very difficult


[12/14/2020 7:04 AM] <Xair>#0000
as it is transferred in and out of shielded addresses too


[12/14/2020 7:04 AM] <Xair>#0000
this way you get benefits of a transparent coin while having the ability to transact privately


[12/14/2020 8:58 AM] <Legend LooTz>#0000
I disaggree


[12/14/2020 8:59 AM] <Legend LooTz>#0000
this is what viewing keys are for


[12/14/2020 8:59 AM] <Legend LooTz>#0000
once you give up consent, you give up you freedom


[12/14/2020 8:59 AM] <Legend LooTz>#0000
once you give up consent, you give up your freedom


[12/14/2020 9:38 AM] <Xair>#0000
viewing keys are nice, that's essentially what you get with partially shielded transactions and stuff, you can hide one side but not the other or unlock certain things once you want to see them


[12/14/2020 9:39 AM] <Xair>#0000
but if you had like $500 in money sitting in a shielded address, to spend it publicly anywhere, all you need to do is transfer it to an unshielded address and it will be as  good as any other transparent transaction which can be verified by anyone without revealing where the money came from still


[12/14/2020 9:40 AM] <Xair>#0000
it adds optional transparency, the default should still be private ofc


[12/14/2020 11:57 AM] <Nivok (3TB)>#0000
Not unless you mix infinitely, all mixing does is make computers do a little busy work.

what you are not factoring in is that chain analysis is not just based on transactions but overall data points. transparent addresses create far too many data points, which makes privacy non-existent

essentially you either have 100% privacy or you have no privacy at all, and then we go back to BTC


[12/14/2020 2:35 PM] <Tinmans>#0000
100% privacy excluding rubber horse cryptanalysis. (re @BPSAA_CommsBot: <+dreamTim - Marketing/SEO> what you are not factoring in is that chain analysis is not just based on transactions but overall data points. transparent addresses create far too many data points, which makes privacy non-existent

[12/14/2020 2:37 PM] <Tinmans>#0000
I wonder if anyone tried doing a diehard test or compression tests on these privacy blockchain node db?
It should well be worth it to determine the quality of the chains.


[12/14/2020 2:55 PM] <Tinmans>#0000
For 100% privacy, the chain data need to appear 100% random. This, maybe relaxed for some  header fields that stay constant over a consequent number of blocks (e.g difficulty for pow). Ofcourse this is information leak  but likely insignificant.


[12/14/2020 3:18 PM] <Nivok (3TB)>#0000
I see that, any attempts to 'black box' a privacy chain by probing the inputs and outputs would be greatly aided by having some public transactions available.  The price of this privacy is the chain being far less attractive to exchanges and traders.


[12/14/2020 3:25 PM] <Tinmans>#0000
I am not sure i understand why privacy coins is less attractive to exchanges and traders.
Take the Bpsaa polarity dex for example. It issues a proxy coin on the public and tranaparent turtlenetwork blockchain.
All privacy coins tx is now transparent on the chain and suitable for traders.

Did i misread what you mentioned?


[12/14/2020 3:31 PM] <Nivok (3TB)>#0000
I was talking about CEXs, they would have to do  more work to support the chain and take on more risk.  Did I miss something?  The 'security' of most blockchains lies in the fact that they are the exact opposite of private.


[12/14/2020 3:32 PM] <Nivok (3TB)>#0000
Don't forget the US govt is trying to stop CEXs from touching privacy chains at all.

[12/14/2020 3:36 PM] <Tinmans>#0000
Not from a technical point but from a practical view point, is the coin marketmaker usually not one or more of the coin whales? Is there a significant risk to the CEX? (re @BPSAA_CommsBot: <Nivok (3TB)> I was talking about CEXs, they would have to do  more work to support the chain and take on more risk.  Did I miss something?

I'm talking from a purely pragmatic viewpoint and there are more barriers to mass adoption than open chains.  DEXs are the way forward, especially the very forgetful ones.

You are looking for a perfect solution which requires bare minimum effort.
That does not exist.
If a solution like that already existed the price of all the coins you are trying to buy would be much higher already. (re @Alektra7: So link is the only one I will find here?  Why would I need to change back to usd? Cannot buy w eth)


[12/19/2020 1:14 AM] <Chuckufarley1>#0000
Out of all the tokens/coins that you listed Link and Ether are currently the only ones listed though the list of coins continues to grow rapidly. Polarity has USDT as it's reserve currency so at present time it is necessary to use it in order to trade into and/or out of coins/tokens. (re @Alektra7: So link is the only one I will find here?  Why would I need to change back to usd? Cannot buy w eth)


[12/19/2020 1:16 AM] <Chuckufarley1>#0000
Although, there is another solution to use the coin/token that you would like to trade for the trade fees but in my opinion it would be more cost efficient to use USDT. (re @Alektra7: So link is the only one I will find here?  Why would I need to change back to usd? Cannot buy w eth)

I don't really think it's the solution she's looking for.

Its actually a clever solution on Polarity. They run it like a stock exchange where everything is brought and settled in us dollar.
Coin 1 to coin2 conversion has 2 moving ends. What they did is to fix one of those ends to avoid slippage. This is necessary for mid to large scale financial investors. Atleast this seems to be their vision from what i understand. I.e., they plan to target more than the small traders and investors we routinely see. (re @Alektra7: So link is the only one I will find here?  Why would I need to change back to usd? Cannot buy w eth)

Something we've been working on for quite sometime, always feels good when something that was just a theory materialises into a working product


[01/01/2021 8:08 PM] <Breakingdead>#0000
True decentralised private messaging, no central servers, all done with AODV style routing. Never been done before which makes it extremely exciting.


[01/01/2021 8:10 PM] <Breakingdead>#0000
We are a couple of weeks out from having our first working crosschain swap inside the chat app ECC to LTC


[01/01/2021 8:15 PM] <Breakingdead>#0000
Some key advantages we have over any of the current competition...
1 - fully decentralized - no central server
2 - instant delivery - no need to wait for a new block be mined
3 - no logging of message anywhere - neither content nor metadata
4 - secure message routing with no verifyably direct connection which means there is no possibility of metadata collection (proof of association) by state agencies
5 - integrated payments
6 - plans for multi-chain payments (none of the others have this)
7 - plans for integrated atomic swaps (none of the others have this)
8 - foundation of a quote oriented DEX protocol and trading apps
9 - decentralized social media platform with fully integrated payments and trading

Nice. It's something we've been planning for a while just had a lot of infrastructure to build in regards to dex usability


[01/02/2021 5:39 PM] <samurai6 - Marketing>#0000
And now we happen to release at a time when people are turning the cold shoulder on privacy coins. So I guess that worked out wellish

It is a centralized option, which carries many risks. 
There are decentralized options to buy Pirate as well.
TNDex and Polarity are great DEX options allowing you greater security benefit. (re @Dawnl: Hi I've just signed up to tradeorge to buy some pirate.  Is this the best place to buy ? üòÅ)

Picking up Arrr and storing it in a secure off chain wallet is pretty establish with Polarity at this point


[01/02/2021 9:25 PM] <Dawnl>#0000
What's the difference between the local account and polarity account ? I've done the polarity account and have to input my seed word every time I log in . Is this correct ?


[01/02/2021 9:27 PM] <swordofdavid>#0000
The polarity security account has a secure vault, you can store many accounts in the vault (re @Dawnl: What's the difference between the local account and polarity account ? I've done the polarity account and have to input my seed word every time I log in . Is this correct ?)


[01/02/2021 9:28 PM] <swordofdavid>#0000
the vault is encrypted by the master password you add

[01/13/2021 4:12 PM] <swordofdavid>#0000
I‚Äôd say deposit and withdraw are fundamental parts of using crypto. 
If an exchange can‚Äôt maintenance their node, why do they even bother?


[01/13/2021 4:20 PM] <cryptorev>#0000
I had a direct run-in with one of their agents. He straight up misrepresented their business to me. 
So I did some digging and it took me seconds to find some pretty foul stuff (re @BPSAA_CommsBot: <eurocry $ARRR> Coinex is an honest exchange to me so far. Only problem is that they don't give a damn to upgrade their ARRR node quickly, so withdrawals and deposits are offline.)

Forwarded from unknown: The purge is escalating.  Tech companies are starting to break contracts with companies in the firearms industry that they've had relationships with for years.  This could easily spread much further as a massive escalation of Obama's Project Chokepoint, only this time with the full support and coordination with massive corporations.

An incentive mechanism (which we call money) which is paramount for susteinance of public blockchains. Take it away, what remains is an impractical usecase.

But please remember that this pair must be searched for manually by typing in the search box on the Turtle Dex market pairs area. And also note that it appears that when there is volume for this market pair, Monero/Arrr, it will not show up in the Turtle Dex volume column unless it is highlighted with a blue star.

A great article about the initial intentions of $BTC to become a censorship resistant and fungible currency, how it was side-tracked and how privacy cryptocurrencies are filling the gap.

One of the most important points it argues, is how Bitcoin is a transparent asset compared to privacy coins which are now the only viable currencies (or medium of exchange) as real money has to be private.

The cryptocurrency revolution is only truly possible with privacy attached. The alternative is that the existing financial system will adopt and absorb crypto, thus exterminating it's positive effect and the opportunities it gives to make the financial playing field more fair.

If we do not embrace privacy, transparent blockchains will lead us to the opposite result. More centralization and financial oppression. This time with an undeniable digital footprint following us everywhere.

Thanks for the intro @wookie25 , appreciate it!
And yes it's good. A little more about RAZE Network: 
Raze Network is a Substrate-based cross-chain privacy protocol for the Polkadot ecosystem. It is built as a native privacy layer that can provide end-to-end anonymity for the entire DeFi stack. 
The objective is to enable cross-chain privacy-preserving payment and trading systems, while protecting the transparency of your assets and behaviors from surveillance. Eventually, Raze Network can anonymize all the cryptocurrency across all chains.

You can just use a local account (all signing is happening locally). Otherwise the vault is not using custodial, its e2e encrypted and you can apply onchain multisig to further secure the wallet.

Hi sent is an ERC20 token so any ETH wallet will do. 
You can buy sent from bilaxy and from hotbit.
Take a look at sent on coinmarketcap . That will tell you where you can get it from (re @UndaWadda: I was exposed to your DVPN through Crytporich. Love your work! Did some research and I can't seem to put my finger on your TSENT token here in Oz or find a wallet that will hold it.

I apologize if it came off that way - but we had to stay in schedule. It was a miscommunication between me as the stream operator and the emcees who thought we had more time for more questions (it was during the q&a when we cut to the break)

For future we will setup a better way to communicate off-air during the stream so it's more smooth.

CR is not a scammer, this i know for sure. He may have been duped into minexcoin (I have no knowledge of this, as i haven't seen the videos he's done on it), but that doesn't make him a scammer. All of the videos i've seen him do are informative and are on solid projects.

[04/05/2021 10:37 AM] <SaveThePlanet>#0000
I can't recommend third party devices, I do it myself. 
I actually provide security to my clients. I could sell you a phone but I think you could easily do it your self plus a learning experience. 
Buy a Moto G Stylus, OnePlus, Nexus device and add your own OS


[04/05/2021 10:37 AM] <SaveThePlanet>#0000
I think that's all librem is anyways....


[04/05/2021 10:37 AM] <SaveThePlanet>#0000
Just PureOS not a google branded OS. You could do it yourself for way cheaperm they charge $800


[04/05/2021 10:37 AM] <SaveThePlanet>#0000
But if it's worth saving time, buy it lol


[04/05/2021 10:41 AM] <D>#0000
Thanks for the input much appreciated üôè so it‚Äôs called PureOS?


[04/05/2021 10:44 AM] <SaveThePlanet>#0000
Well that's the OS they use, there is plenty of open source OS out there that does not involve google out there.


[04/05/2021 10:44 AM] <SaveThePlanet>#0000
If you have a amazon account over year old with rep, buy a Nexus or OnePlus. Say it never came.
Boom free $700


[04/05/2021 10:46 AM] <D>#0000
Cool thanks for your help. Is there any good instruction manual online for booting your own os?


[04/05/2021 10:52 AM] <SaveThePlanet>#0000
Yes XDA forum. Google the model of the phone there will be a guide, and there will be OS reviews on XDA too


[04/05/2021 10:52 AM] <SaveThePlanet>#0000
Make sure to follow the instructions all the way, it can be easy to fuck up sometimes

Hello, I am interested in ETHO Protocol from the BPSAA. Does ETHO have any competitors? I was under the impression that Web 3.0 already existed and sites like LBRY and others could not be taken down and were already censorship-proof. Or are sites like that using ETHO in some way?

Just a quick development update on Etho Protocol:

Etho.Black has pushed out our test version Etho Protocol Upload App 2.0 using the newly built ethofs sdk npm module which will help us onboard more users and applications more efficiently going forward as we continue evolving toward a fully functional protocol, usable in all aspects of decentralization; from decentralized websites, DeFi and all way to NFTs. This is a critical step in testing the usability of the SDK as we re prioritize 2021 as the year of onboarding people and applications into the Etho ecosystem.

https://uploads.ethoprotocol.com

You can test it out and report bugs at:

https://github.com/etho-black/etho-upload-app

And if you are feeling brave, I encourage you to test out the SDK. We are continuing to add more functionality to the module as testing progresses allowing for a broader range of applications and usability.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ethofs/sdk

An interesting metric to watch is the sdk module download stats as more and more begin to utilize  the protocol.

AtromG8 is a service to society, delivered through technology in the form of software. Technology is the infrastructure. Passion and to make the world a better place is our motivation!

ATROMG8.com has come a long way. When the network
joined forces in 2013, everyone was still working on other
projects and was able to gain initial experience with the
‚Äúnew‚Äù blockchain technology.

Everyone spokes a word about blockchain on which the
leading technological minds have agreed after long
arguments to describe a process that began many years
before and was anything but new.

What was new about this concept, however, is that a
pseudonym called Satoshi Nakamoto took it to a new level
in 2008. For the first time, there was a realistic alternative
solution that could free us from the clutches of the banks.
An industry was created out of the ground and has since
conquered the world. Within a little more than 10 years,
the value of Bitcoin has grown from a few cents to over
USD 50,000 last week. Millions of percent in growth.
Nothing has developed in value like Bitcoin. Anyone who
shopped back then and experienced all the difficulties
and still stood by the project is now a rich man or woman.
The trick is not to let yourself be unsettled by difficulties,
but to solve them and move on.

Like everyone else, we dreamed of new concepts and also
dealt with wallets and all other products that the world
could need, and that did not exist back then. It was also
very important to us from the start that we can do our part
to make the world a better place and to develop
intelligent solutions. Much has changed since then.

Just a quick update. The _Signum_ hard fork on  *Burstcoin* went smooth today. A new consensus algorithm called _Proof of Commitment_ went live today and all seems stable. The new algo is a hybrid of Proof of Capacity and Proof of Stake favoring small miners though reducing chances of centralized mining.

Best email unless you host your own is proton mail but email is always weak on security because there are TWO SIDES, so you can have the most secure mail on the planet but if you are talking to someone using Gmail it does not matter and all us companies must keep all email for a time, pretty sure it is 7 years. (re @foxfire_actual: Before I do this, is there a decentralized email in the bpsaa?)


[04/25/2021 2:42 PM] <SurvivalPodcast>#0000
so even when karen in hr deletes her email it is still on a back up storage server, thats any public company


[04/25/2021 2:43 PM] <foxfire_actual>#0000
Kinda what I was wondering. Almost like we all need a dozen trash burner emails.

too bad, someone needs to do social media on blockchain right, why the hell no one will IDK, we know what works, we know what people like to use, so instead of building that with a wallet lets pour in tons of work to building something NOT like that

Right.

I've been in hive and steem since 2017. Been largely ignoring it as everything but the blogging platform. (re @SurvivalPodcast: I tried dbuzz good idea, buggy as all hell, tons of steps just to try to use it seems to me everything associated with Hive is needlessly complicated)


[04/25/2021 3:01 PM] <foxfire_actual>#0000
The lack of more innovation there is saddening. I really liked steepshot, but they didn't keep up. Did really well fundraisinging a chicken flock on fundition, and that platform flopped. Was in on the development of one of the most active communities there, but social pressure says "hey, don't cash out that $25k, it'll tank everything."


[04/25/2021 3:02 PM] <foxfire_actual>#0000
Matter of fact, I'm liquidating a good bit of my meager stake there to roll into bpsaa projects.

I've been deeply involved with LBRY/Odysee for over 4 years. Wouldn't it be great if LBRY was also part of this. It's the same thinking they have. However, LBC is a BTC fork and with it being a surveillance coin, it means anyone publishing free speech content can potentially be tracked and persecuted, thus it's can't really be the free speech tool it wants to be.

As you might know, LBRY Inc is already being targeted by the powers that be, via the SEC. As a result, LBC is under threat. If worst comes to worst and they have to do a new coin, I think teaming up with Pirate Chain would be a match made in heaven.

Just throwing that our there! Food for thought! :LBC: :LBC: :LBC: :LBC:

As you might know, LBRY Inc is already being targeted by the powers that be, via the SEC. As a result, LBC is under threat. If worst comes to worst and they have to do a new coin, I think teaming up with Pirate Chain would be a match made in heaven.
Just throwing that our there! Food for thought! :LBC: :LBC: :LBC: :LBC:)

Hi John, for partner evaluation we have an application process. On the bpsaa.vision website you can fill out a partnership application and then we can evaluate it and bring you in for an interview if things check out and the orgs are aligned.

@Draeth | $ARRR/$NLIFE/BPSAA 
I'm wondering why Bpsaa partnered with dragonchain, who is working on creating covidpasses. 
This sounds globalist and I was shocked to see such a project work be endorsed by Bpsaa


[04/28/2021 2:15 AM] <Draeth - Project Lead/HR>#0000
they also provide privacy and security for businesses


[04/28/2021 2:15 AM] <Draeth - Project Lead/HR>#0000
as well as provide notarization services for other chains, rendering 51% attacks useless pretty much


[04/28/2021 2:19 AM] <Susie>#0000
Dragon chain is pushing for digital identification. The same things as bill gates and other globalist organizations

About BURST.
Will there be any publications or promotions in connection with the upcoming Signum hard fork?
It would be nice if the team updated the guides and minting instructions. I watched YouTube and all the videos are very old.
I think this should be done, given that Chia (a competitor for minting on hard drives) has filled YouTube with various fresh information, including in different languages.
It would also be nice to update the original Bitcointalk forum post.
All information is outdated. The topic starter logged into the forum for the last time in September 20, and the last post dates back to May 20. 
It's not looking good.
After all, BURST has a lot of interesting things ahead in development, somehow more activity is needed.
The community and newcomers should know for sure that BURST is alive and kickingüí™

[05/06/2021 4:46 PM] <whobiz>#0000
Hey all. I‚Äôd like to discuss potential opportunities between BLUR and BPSAA as we strengthen our ties to the KMD ecosystem this year.
I plan on submitting an application via website, but thought it might be wise to chat about ways we can collaborate first.


[05/06/2021 4:47 PM] <whobiz>#0000
We‚Äôre actively working hard to make DPoW interoperable with XMR-style networks. I think we could mirror these efforts similarly toward the strengthening of BPSAA‚Äôs capabilities.


[05/06/2021 4:55 PM] <cryptorev>#0000
Sounds intriguing


[05/06/2021 5:02 PM] <whobiz>#0000
Our work on bridging incompatibility between XMR/BTC networks can be expanded further, with some relative ease. 
We‚Äôve already solved problems like incompatible JSON-RPC specs, and adding some basic BTC-style functionality to our codebase (including API endpoints, bitcoin types in code, doublesha256 hash algo...)


[05/06/2021 5:03 PM] <whobiz>#0000
Potential to open up some options for both BLUR and BPSAA, it seems to me

Bpsaa brothers - the ergo community is growing nicely. This project has a lot of momentum now but it's still very undervalued. The ergoDex is coming in a couple of months (swap platform for ADA and ERG) and the cardano crowd are slowly coming over to discover ergo. The price is rising and it's deserved because the fundamentals are so strong

Whenever the PirateDEX is coming out officially, I would like to help translating it into Estonian language, so that even those, who do not speak English very well, could use the app. And I will then definitely create an instruction video in Estonian on how to use the PirateDEX.
So the Pirate Chain Team or Komodo Team - please let me know, if and how we could make this happen. Thanks in advance!

Great interview just watched the whole thing. I‚Äôm excited for all of the developments and the new nodes and the launch on cosmos..
I liked the party about the Graviety Dex. It‚Äôs coming out in a couple weeks. My understanding is you can swap Cosmos (Atom) directly for DVPN. The only other way you can get DVPN now is from the MXC exchange...
Can you ask him next time if DVPN is planned to be listed on bigger exchanges? That‚Äôd be huge if it got on Binance or Kraken? 
It‚Äôs cool they‚Äôre going for a million users, I wonder when they‚Äôll hit that? (re @CR202020: üëç)

I see. Oh so they charge the dev team a listing fee? How much are these fees in the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of $?
I see yeah Dex‚Äôs will improve people‚Äôs access over time but it‚Äôs a multi step process. Most people like using binance/kraken/coinbase because all they have to do is push a button to buy a crypto....
On a Dex, they‚Äôd have to figure out where to buy cosmos on a centralized exchange , then transfer it off and to a Dex to then figure out how to swap it for DVPN, then set up a wallet. Most people are either or too uneducated to do that... (re @CR202020: The problem with big exchanges, is that they charge really big listing fees.

The people across the bpsaa did pretty thorough due diligence on the Dragonchain product.


[05/23/2021 7:27 PM] <Swarm10>#0000
yes but the point is that we're not the type to have  blind faith in any central authority, including the bpsaa. needs to be report of why they passed so called due-diligence, otherwise bpsaa and dragonchain are both suspect.

Make sure your spending key starts with secret-extended-key if you need more help please open a support ticket on our discord channel (re @jos_sothoth: If I may bother you again...I was able to import the View key without issues. However, when I copy and paste the spending key it keeps coming up as invalid. Is this a known issue? I am hesitating to upgrade the wallet but would have after this had been done. Thank you.)

Turtle Community, it's time to provide liquidity in https://t.co/Qesh6Mv9jS.
It's easy, it's cheap and it's good for both the $TN and $WAVES 
interoperability.
Also a nice fact your $USDN provided is automated staked, earning even more APY.

Hi BPSAA Community, I want to let you guys know that Conceal.Network will apply today for a BPSAA membership. If there are any questions you can always DM me. Thankyou.


[08/07/2021 1:24 PM] <yogisha>#0000
Sinovate.io has already applied for BPSAA membership couple of months ago.  We have never heard back from the team.  I am surprised because sinovate is a no ico or pre-mine project with active financial reports since 2018 and among the top 100 blockchain project with github commits. üòäüëç
It was me who told the sinovate team to apply for the membership with BPSAA.  I have been with BPSAA projects like ETHO,  ERGO,  ARRR since the begining.  I thought Sinovate is also an amazing project just like the others which I mention above. So I kindly request the BPSAA team to look into this.

I was about to order https://poolpartynodes.com/product/pirate-chain-cuffed-beanie/ and a pillow, but when the payment checkout page came, it only offered ETH and BTC as crypto payments. I cancelled the deal, because of no ARRR in the selection. Will ARRR be accepted at one point in poolpartynodes? :) (re @Lastsamurai6: https://twitter.com/PoolPartyNodes/status/1433535212307324931?s=19)

[10/09/2021 10:33 PM] <vestedcrypto>#0000
From verbal updates in the weekly BPSAA board meetings. I don‚Äôt recall specifics, it‚Äôs kind of a rapid-fire download from everyone, but they check in every week and, like all the other projects, provide high-level project updates. Sometimes it‚Äôs not much more than ‚Äúyeah we‚Äôre just super busy working on things, no major milestone updates to report this week‚Äù. 
Same goes for us at ETHO - we‚Äôve been working on the same handful of things for like two months now, and each week it‚Äôs like ‚Äúyeah, still plugging away at it - no big announcements ready yet‚Äù (re @jArcanum: How do you know? What are some examples of what they are working on?)

Sentinel still not hiding ipv6 location.... When will they protect users against this leak? (re @CR202020: )


[11/14/2021 11:09 AM] <Kellydiana86>#0000
Hi everyone, how did you spend the weekend?üòä


[11/14/2021 11:29 AM] <t_slam>#0000
unfortunately yeah (re @Luc11: Sentinel still not hiding ipv6 location.... When will they protect users against this leak?)


[11/14/2021 3:58 PM] <Luc11>#0000
Is big issue, i cant change/disable the wifi router as its not mine so if my connection to a site is monitored they'll see the ipv4 address is totally different place to ipv6, which shows a location near me! 
This must be remedied if sentinel hopes for mass adoption by non techy people, who maybe using it thinking their location is hidden but actually they are standing up naked in a cornfield... 
I'm not techy myself but am aware how to check basic privacy protocols online. Most potential users will be oblivious to whether their vpn is hiding them or not. Bpsaa need to put pressure on sentinel, as a member of bpsaa, to up their game and not make false adverts on keeping you private whilst connected to their nodes (re @t_slam: unfortunately yeah)

[11/14/2021 11:00 PM] <Luc11>#0000
I am unable to disable as i dont have access to it as its not mine to mess with. But im bringing it up because what "normal" everyday person would be faffed to do that or even know of this crucial leakage... Sentinel just need to hide location on ipv6 by default , like pirate chain... Private at the default level... A vpn organisation needs to implement this ethos too. It's future proofing it too as ipv6 will become normal standard. (re @MindOverMatter5: Disable ipv6)


[11/14/2021 11:01 PM] <Luc11>#0000
I did a while back but was told to just disable it.... That's not an acceptable solution esp in this covidian era of surveillance (re @yogisha: Did u pt dis in sentinel group?)


[11/15/2021 1:24 AM] <MindOverMatter5>#0000

Masq is a joke they are pro proprietary software, this is right in their FAQ
"Since MASQ Network is built on an entirely unique network protocol, it operates on the top of the network stack using leading edge communication - no out of the box OpenVPN protocols or other means"
So instead of implementing a proven open source solution they decide to create their own then confuse you with tech jargon so they can shit on open source by calling it "out of the box". As if some private company can suddenly create a better product than years of open source development (re @t_slam: what you guys think of this?

So instead of implementing a proven open source solution they decide to create their own then confuse you with tech jargon so they can shit on open source by calling it "out of the box". As if some private company can suddenly create a better product than years of open source development)


[11/19/2021 7:52 PM] <cryptorev>#0000
It would be quite difficult to find any group of more than a very small amount of people where people didn't make statements while overlooking details. As long as you aren't doing it yourself there's nothing for you to get upset over. (re @KauriHero: I'm open to criticism any time, but it didn't seem like he read much more than 2 mins before posting that info.
I'm not a snowflake, but right away he failed to miss that the project is open source and not a private company at all)


[11/19/2021 7:53 PM] <KauriHero>#0000
Yeah totally understand, and that's a fair point
Just an interesting view put out which surprised me (re @cryptorev: It would be quite difficult to find any group of more than a very small amount of people where people didn't make statements while overlooking details. As long as you aren't doing it yourself there's nothing for you to get upset over.)


[11/19/2021 7:54 PM] <KauriHero>#0000
It's true in many instances actually, as often the open source solutions or projects have a slower development speed due to smaller budgets and volunteer contributors. (re @dumrod: In many industries this is not a hypothetical, private ventures routinely create better products than 'years of open source development')


[11/19/2021 7:56 PM] <KauriHero>#0000
Crypto landscape changed that in the way capital can be be raised without all the red tape usually found in VC and Angel investing into new tech.
I'm speaking from starting back in 2017 of course - now there's more regulation and restrictions coming through in that area


[11/19/2021 7:57 PM] <dumrod>#0000
@cryptorev Although comments like 'Masq is a joke' that's a fairly liberal definition of open discussion and collaboration. The comment overall seemed more suggestive of animus than a desire to collaborate. Just my reading


[11/19/2021 7:58 PM] <cryptorev>#0000
yeah that's true - it was unnecessarily hostile


[11/19/2021 9:17 PM] <KauriHero>#0000

Apologies,  those were the comments from another telegram group while I was searching about "masq" 
just posted it here to know others opinion..
I believe and support in privacy projects and huge efforts are taken by the teams for the great web 3.0, have to really appreciate every team and members here.  Sorry üëçüòä (re @KauriHero: Entitled to your opinion I guess.
But you sound like ole boy Alan Greenspan a few years ago when Defi was first born.
I joined this group as I love the idea of your Privacy Alliance, but if this is the attitude towards new idea or members I'll see my way out.)


[11/20/2021 2:46 AM] <KauriHero>#0000
No worries! Appreciate your reply. 
Our team are advocates for all privacy and freedom centric projects - that's Def what attracted me to your alliance and community too.
I'm sure the people who have doubts will come round once we make the beta software public, which is very soon.
Open to feedback as well from everyone in the space, to improve our software and project.
Thanks again and have good weekend everyone (re @yogisha: Apologies,  those were the comments from another telegram group while I was searching about "masq"

Signum

1,000,000 Blocks Mined on Signum Blockchain
Signum is a public blockchain platform with very unique features. It went online on August 11, 2014 under the name "Burstcoin" without a premine or ICO. It was the first blockchain to offer a Turing-complete smart contract engine (Ethereum went online in July 2015). Another differentiator is the mining algorithm, which started as proof-of-capaci...

Hello, has somebody experiences with the sentinel dvpn app? Is it good or bad?


[04/08/2022 11:55 PM] <Channel_Bot>#0000
I am disappointed mostly. Vision is great and connects with many core values of why I entered this space. But their products shipped recently haven't been the quality I expect. I'm treating it as a longer term investment as the premise is very promising. (re @GEZwungener: Hello, has somebody experiences with the sentinel dvpn app? Is it good or bad?)


[04/09/2022 12:33 AM] <GEZwungener>#0000
Why are you disappointed? What is not working so well? Are there any other similar projects? (re @Channel_Bot: I am disappointed mostly. Vision is great and connects with many core values of why I entered this space. But their products shipped recently haven't been the quality I expect.

Yes, from testing on an android I can see they have. Looking forward to the solar apps. More visibility in the Devs and Alex is doing great things (re @Luc11: Have they dealt with the ipv6 leaks yet?)


[05/02/2022 9:03 AM] <Luc11>#0000
Thats good. I had ipv6 leaks on android but only when using wifi from landline routers like bthub. But when using mobile internet or mobile hotspot wifi there was no ipv6 leaks... I thought that strange. (re @Channel_Bot: Yes, from testing on an android I can see they have. Looking forward to the solar apps. More visibility in the Devs and Alex is doing great things)

Polarity or Kucoin (re @foxfire_actual: What exchanges can be used to buy dvpn tokens for using sentinel?)
