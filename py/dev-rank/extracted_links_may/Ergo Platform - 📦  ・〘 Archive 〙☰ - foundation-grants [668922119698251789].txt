Hi Community,

I would like to apply for grants about a project/idea on Distributed Signatures which I have explained here https://www.ergoforum.org/t/app-on-distributed-signatures/342. The project has arisen from a discussion with Kushti over email.
I tried to provide needed information in the forum post but please let me know if anything else is needed.

I also have an idea about a tutorial on developing app on top of Ergo's blockchain which has also arisen from a discussion on discord about lack of materials regarding this subject. I will propose this idea after the decision about the first one is made.

Hi! @Mark Stopka (The Storage Guy) how's it going ?

@kushti hi, how is it going?


[10/30/2020 9:54 PM] Mark Stopka (The Storage Guy)#1826
I have a AMA tomorrow at DIGI channel (Rick McCracken if you know him), I was wondering if it's ok, to mention that we spoke about partnering with you guys regarding the GPU compute part of dCloud

Hi team,
Your 2021 roadmap caught my eyes actually. I was wondering if there is some mechanism and incentive for outsiders to contribute to the project and be supported somehow?

I see this already in work in other channels, right? Is it transparent how the teams is supporting such contributions or is it not really needed currently?


[11/13/2020 12:29 PM] Robert K#0722
@JohnThelen The Ergo Foundation is always open to taking in grant applications for anything you think would be valuable to add to the ecosystem: https://ergoplatform.org/en/foundation/

The vast majority of work is transparent, with some projects here and there being private until they reach a point where they can be showed off publicly.


[11/13/2020 12:30 PM] Robert K#0722
It'd be great to have you contribute if you have a great idea/the ability to execute. What were you thinking of implementing?


[11/13/2020 12:43 PM] JohnThelen#4283
@Robert K Thanks a lot. I just was going through your video about introduction to ergo script and here https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergoscript-by-example. Very good stuff, thanks.


[11/13/2020 12:45 PM] JohnThelen#4283
I don't have any particular idea right now, I just was wondering about the overall mechanisms. So I was going through the projects and it seems like the core team is currently focusing on the big picture stuff like dex and stable coins, right?


[11/13/2020 12:47 PM] JohnThelen#4283
So I suppose there is a lot of possibilities for outsiders to develop other apps like the above but didn't see any clear explanation about the mechanism. Has this "The Ergo Foundation supports a grant program (guide will be announced soon)" been announced somewhere?


[11/13/2020 12:47 PM] Robert K#0722
Yep, we're checking off all the core foundational stuff in every direction pretty much.


[11/13/2020 12:48 PM] Robert K#0722
From dApps, to developer tools, to making things more user friendly, it's all in the works.


[11/13/2020 12:49 PM] Robert K#0722
Unfortunately that has not been released, but if you wish to submit a grant feel free to give an overall summary, intended goals, how much you are asking for, and timeline for a grant proposal.


[11/13/2020 12:51 PM] JohnThelen#4283
That makes sense, thanks. Will be in touch üòÄ


[11/13/2020 8:51 PM] kushti#0978
@JohnThelen there're also alternative funds even, e.g. DarkFund0 just established, no announcement yet even, it will support privacy-oriented efforts mostly. The fund #0 is for testing the things, thus small, but nevertheless )

Is there any interest in a grant for a blockchain based grant management system

We already have the ZK Treasury which effectively can be used for an on-chain grant program: https://github.com/anon-real/DistributedSigsServer

Okay awesome, I'll check it out, thanks


[01/02/2021 8:05 PM] QU‚Ç≥Z‚Ç≥R#0436
would this manage state/federal grants?


[01/02/2021 8:06 PM] QU‚Ç≥Z‚Ç≥R#0436
i'm not a developer so while I can go to github and poke around, I'm not experienced enough to appreciate everything that is there.


[01/02/2021 11:40 PM] kushti#0978
@QU‚Ç≥Z‚Ç≥R ZKT is intended for small funds controlled by few folks who do trust each other but willing to preserve privacy of on-chain voting


[01/02/2021 11:42 PM] QU‚Ç≥Z‚Ç≥R#0436
Understood, thank you. So a miniature risk pool, to a degree


[01/02/2021 11:44 PM] kushti#0978
@QU‚Ç≥Z‚Ç≥R yes, like that


[01/02/2021 11:45 PM] QU‚Ç≥Z‚Ç≥R#0436
Im in the insurance space, been creating risk pools IRL, so much more fun doing it with crypto/blockcbain

Rewind, the grant management system we've designed is for state/federal grant mgmt


[01/02/2021 11:49 PM] QU‚Ç≥Z‚Ç≥R#0436
ZKT and oracle pools is a match made in heaven


[01/02/2021 11:50 PM] QU‚Ç≥Z‚Ç≥R#0436
Should there be a desire to eliminate the voting or perhaps assist in the voting


[01/04/2021 10:45 PM] kushti#0978
how so ?


[01/04/2021 10:46 PM] QU‚Ç≥Z‚Ç≥R#0436
Using oraclew pools to manage treasuries


[01/04/2021 10:47 PM] QU‚Ç≥Z‚Ç≥R#0436
or assist in managing them


[01/04/2021 10:49 PM] QU‚Ç≥Z‚Ç≥R#0436
I'm not a dev and also not completely caught up on ergo, so if I am wrong, please correct me.


[01/04/2021 10:51 PM] QU‚Ç≥Z‚Ç≥R#0436
My specialty is in insurance/risk management, product/program development.  Check out parametric insurance if you have a chance @kushti
