[06/10/2021 2:45 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Hey all, as my comment says here I am working on smart contract mining pools. The goal is to have them be shardable, with a global saturation function  to financially encourage decentralization.

To make this possible, the project will need developers with (or a willingness to learn) ergoscript. Scala and Haskell knowledge would likely also be an asset.

I have a day off work, so I will put together a presentation including all of my research and reasoning for the different tiers of smart contracts, and how this project could expand.

[06/10/2021 2:54 PM] danandbeard#3509
let me know if anyone can use my skillset - sr. software dev that works mostly with distributed systems
can do GUI stuff but mainly backend dev - no experience with smart contracts, but I can figure them out


[06/10/2021 3:17 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
ErgoScript is very simple. (Scala based I think, someone correct me if I'm wrong.)

You (and anyone honestly would be welcome to join my team if you like, but if you have gui experience there are other projects that are looking for GUI devs. (including the Ergo team itself, I think.) I wouldn't want to pull a GUI dev to learn other stuff when there are teams in Ergo looking for ya! üôÇ


[06/10/2021 3:19 PM] danandbeard#3509
I'll check out your presentation and see if I fit in - I can do GUI work, but that's not my expertise by any means

I'd be happy to join if you don't mind, I've only started with ERGO script and SCALA, I have a background in an automation language similar to assembly so havent used high level languages in years.

[06/10/2021 6:04 PM] Reed#7093
Like pooled mining?


[06/10/2021 6:10 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
Pooled mining but not in the traditional sense, an approach that used decentralized pool mining and attempts to stop larger pools with huge hash power. Very interesting idea!


[06/10/2021 6:11 PM] Reed#7093
Is this related? https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/044.pdf

Stone, paper, scissors game with bets. Know I've seen a tutorial in Solidity like that.

Perhaps a simple dice game depending on if ergoscript can provide random number generation?

Regarding intermediate tutorials I'm thinking a betting system underneath common card games where funds are held in an address/contract for a certain amount of games/time. Maybe "Ergo poker" :yum:

We are more or less complete. We are planning to build a tool for data notarization

But if there will be somebody frontend (webdesign) oriented who will not have any team, we have no problem and would welcome him in our team. We are mainly backend (@nitram147, @zas_henten ) developpers and one frontend [javascript] developper (@Pavol Hejny). But we are lacking any webdesign guy/girl.```

I've been developing in Python, C#, Nodejs, RN, and React. Would be able to work on something backend and frontend, though I'm most interested to get my hands dirty in crypto coding. 

I'm chill and enjoy being on a discord server, working while grabbing pizza, or making food. Have occasional breaks and also play games to relax. I play Dota. I'd also get intoxicated and smoked too.

Let me know if you have an idea, and need my skills, and also enjoy the same chill vibe! üôÇ

It would probably be good to have some standard for nfts, eg: collection has: category, subcategory, rarity etc so that you could filter them, eg. Show all mtg cards, filter by rarity etc

Hi All. I am a Strategy & Ops Manager working in a FinTech Unicorn. I have 5 years experience in coding (worked as a developer till 2017 - JS, Java, Scala, Python, ASP.NET, Shell Scripts, etc). I am looking for 1-2 people to work on solving a business problem using Ergo's toolkit (which I honestly believe is comprehensive and powerful). I am hoping for people who have some understanding of Ergo's toolkit (at the very least - have setup your own Ergo node and gone through the Swagger API; good to have - experience in Ergoscript, Rust, ZK Proofs, NiPoPoW).

I have a few ideas which can increase Ergo's utility for users. I am open to discussions and we will be shortlisting a project based on a framework approach. Once done, we can work over the Hackathon on developing a PoC and then decide whether the project warrants further efforts for a scalable solution.

Please feel free to ping me to form a team.

There seems to be quite a few people (including myself) who are looking for exploratory work and not necessarily committing to a submission for the hackathon. Is this by design or are there other resources that should be utilized?

Typical remote hackathon problems. Just want to make sure I find a path to be productive even if there isn't necessarily a final product since there will be a learning curve

Check out the following channels for seed projects @ERGOHACK II Participants 

Discuss the ideas here and form teams. Leave a note saying 'interested' if it's something you'd want to participant in. 

I can tag people based on skillsets if needed too based on what they filled out in the form. More will be added based on the poll once I clarify the suitability of each.  

#deleted-channel 
#deleted-channel 
#deleted-channel 
#deleted-channel 
#stealth-addresses 
and #üèû‚îÇnft-projects 

Or if you'd rather your own channel for a idea you have just @ me and I can make one up.

Hi, I'm looking to broaden my blockchain - ergo knowledge. I'm an experienced scala developer with a tiny bit of ergoscript fooling around.
Anyone interested in signing me in for the hackathon?


[10/03/2021 6:58 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Hello all. Last Hackathon my team submitted SmartPools, an early decentralized mining solution. 

This team my team will be aiming to produce an on chain music streaming/ library platform where artists can share  their audio NFTs, while (ideally) remaining in possession of the NFTs, and listeners can donate to the artists if they so choose, while building their own music library. 

The project is inspired by FunkWhale, an open source federated music streaming platform for Creative Commons licensed music. 

For the Hackathon I aim to produce a whitepaper and ideally function smart contracts (this should be relatively easy, as the auction house contracts can be adapted). 

In the future, light clients can be constructed that allow listeners to download their library from blockchain. 

It would be lovely to merge my team with any others, or have others join my team. üòÉ


[10/03/2021 6:58 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
If you don‚Äôt have a team, you are welcome to join mine, see my post above. üôÇ


[10/06/2021 1:15 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
@glasgowm I‚Äôm currently working on a scala application that allows groups of people to send their mining pool rewards to a single smart contract which automatically distributes rewards back to the miners in a way that is proportional to their hashrate. 

The goal is to create subpools of low hashrate miners that can pool together their hashrates without a third party controlling the rewards. 

I‚Äôm just wondering if I could submit this project for the hackathon?


[10/06/2021 1:21 PM] glasgowm#9381
of course! I presume you've read through #üß†‚îÇsmartpools who done the foundation for this the last ergohack right?


[10/06/2021 1:24 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Yeah I was inspired by that project and my own need for a smart contract based solution for this problem. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm well versed enough to help contribute to smartpools just yet, but I see this as a first step.


[10/06/2021 1:27 PM] glasgowm#9381
cool just checking üôÇ got a name in mind?


[10/06/2021 1:28 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
ergo-subpooling is what I thought of.

Hi all ! Just quit from Nervos hackathon2. Unfortunately we don‚Äôt accomplish the target of  building a landing/borrowing platform with some sort of creation due to team reason and immature skills.                      I just setuped a full node of ergo and start mining. Maybe establish a mining pool later.                                        I don‚Äôt familiar with Java and so ergoscript. But I know some JavaScript and Python instead.                            I have learned that the importance of team so hope cooperate with people who can take responsibility to lead the project to the end and take it easy as well. In this course we all can benefit from each other ‚úåÔ∏è


[10/06/2021 11:12 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
This is great! What you are describing is an essential component of SmartPools functioning!

Hey guys, I'm a full stack developer working on understanding how a wallet app generates wallets and stores them for mobile phones. I use Cordova for development and am trying to implement it in JavaScript html and css. I have a node but from my understanding, a node only allows you to have one wallet, so would each phone be its own node?


[12/02/2021 5:07 AM] soysor#6001
I believe you're right about a node only supporting one wallet. If you use your mobile app to manage the wallet keys instead of the node you can support multiple wallets on each phone

Hello everyone!


[12/29/2021 5:53 PM] quokka#1273
I'm looking for someone to work on a project with me for the hackathon. This project will be long-term but we can probably create a decent MVP by the end of the hackathon. I'm looking for someone who can help me write the ErgoScript contracts and set up-deploy the contracts/backend, I can do the front-end with React and have experience building the front-end for a headless dApp (ergosaurs.io - hdapp for auction house). I also have experience building backends so I can help with that if needed. 

I want to create an NFT marketplace where people can list their NFT's, with approved projects. I think this is needed for Ergo NFT's because people don't like that hassle of having to do an auction every time they want to sell something. While the auction house brought in a lot of artists, I think this marketplace would bring in a lot of traders. Since Ergo NFT's also have royalties I think this would be great for the artists in this space as well. I think this is required to make the ENFT space flourish.

The project would be a variation of the current open-source contracts of the auction house. I've already written a *very* rough draft of the ErgoScript and I'm taking the hackathon as an opportunity to find someone who also thinks this would be good for the space, as well as take advantage of the mentors available.

If you're interested just lmk!

Seems to me like you have a transferable experience that could be utilized for many projects that might have a need for data analysis, researching, and/or system thinking, as the focus of the hackathon is on Privacy and Security I could see your skillset very useful to a team that has an ambition to win and with you on board they could have a very well written analyzed write up to submit for the final submission - I wish you had been around for ErgoHack II cause I was forced to write up our final submission and I think I am very lucky to have won cause that was like pulling teeth for me to properly submit my teams proposal.

I hope you find a team for this I really do, it is inline with privacy and should not go unnoticed, not to mention if you can pull it off the automatic switching you are looking to build would open up so many routes of development through a Dex as wrapped assets become available, looking forward to this Hack for sure.


[01/04/2022 7:57 AM] AggerGakker#4449
We are discussing in our ErgoLearn group about signing up. We've had one other who was interested, so that would technically make us four people already. As is the usual dilemma, most of us have limited coding experience, but we all have the same mindset that this is more about just learning. I've been looking into the ErgoDex SDK and have begun to deconstruct things. I believe it's doable. Let's see where things go ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[01/04/2022 9:18 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Can't wait to see what you guys end up making. This is such a crucial ability for miners to have, and doing it in a smart contract environment really goes to show that traditional mining pools could become a thing of the past.

hi guys! is anybody working on a mixing yield platform? Would be awesome to build one that incentivizes mixing. Meaning, users could take their LP's (Ergodex for now) and then stake them (mix) in "tumble finance' or whatever you wanna name it. We could incentivize the whole thing with a '$Tumble' token for example. Mixing of ERGO or SigUS, AnetaBTC etc could be incentivized as well with that mechanic. If we want to make private defi a thing - this is my idea üôÇ 
Considering that cross-chain bridges are being build, would that not be the one service that money from other chains would "need" from ergo?

I don't need a team but I have an idea. How about developing an ipsec vpn or Tor client as a dapp to the wallet? The wallets public key or an nft could be used for authentication. The server side VPN could be stood up by a users provided cloud server through Algo (https://github.com/trailofbits/algo) or a public\paid hosted choice. Of course it would be called ErgoTunnel.

It would be cool if the wallet could store key pairs besides its own, like a password keeper. Or an nft could store metadata like encrypted key pairs that are decrypted by the wallets private key.

Hi guys! I have an idea for hackathon but I am not a dev. Would be happy to share the idea in depth if anybody is interested. Basically, it would be a kind of liquidity pool that dynamically provides liquidity to ergodex or the ergomixer so that when people are trying to mix there is good liquidity, and when people arent mixing the tokens are locked in ergodex generating profits off of fees

Hi Ergonauts!

I have a proposal for ErgoHack III and I‚Äôm in need of developers!

My proposal draws inspiration from Umbrel (Twitter: @getumbrel) which allows users to ‚Äúrun a personal server with a bitcoin and lightning node in your home and self-host open source apps‚Äù all on a Raspberry Pi using Umbrel OS.

I believe the value proposition for this idea on Ergo is that users will be able to easily support the network by having their own node, while also having the ability to safely and securely access both already available open source applications (e.g. password managers, photo vaults) and the applications/utility that will continue to emerge from the Ergo ecosystem (i.e. DeFi Platforms, NFT Markets, Mixers, Bots, etc.) via an open source Ergo dApp store self-hosted on a Raspberry Pi. 

I‚Äôm confident that there are many market participants (investors, speculators, hobbyists) that will find value in a low barrier method to participate in a blockchain like Ergo, that has solid fundamentals, high assurance, and innovative utility.

If you‚Äôre interested or can offer any constructive feedback I would greatly appreciate it! Good luck to all the teams involved!

How to setup an Ergo node on a Raspberry Pi
Mute if you dont want to hear my vega64‚Äôs breathing in the background. I made this because the official one contains some errors and leaves out some useful information. If you follow along and do as I did, you will have a fully running node, it will take some time for it to fully sync the node on your pi. This process is nearly identical for set...

Hey, I'm looking to work on a stealth address library for ergo hack if anyone is interested (https://www.ergoforum.org/t/stealth-address-contract/255)

Implemented in Rust (likely making heavy use of `sigma-rust`), breakdown of functionality:

- Sharable public key generation (merchant)
- Buyer key + shared secret generation (buyer)
- Box creation (buyer)
- Box checking (merchant - is box at script address spendable)
- Probably other stuff I don't know of yet

Extra stuff if there's time - library is the priority but if that looks good then wallet-x integrations:

(React/TypeScript/Rust)

- wasm bindings
- Add wasm lib to wallet-x (https://github.com/ross-weir/wallet-x)
- Add UI to wallet-x for displaying & generating sharable public addresses
- Other integrations (merchant monitoring spendable boxes, etc)

**"Oracel Pool Hub"**

A platform to match oracle operators with pool creators whilst enhancing security through transparency and documentation. Actual name TBD.

Objectives:
- Lowering the technical threshold to onboard oracle operators by providing scripts and or installers.
- Providing a web based interface to configure and launch new pools.
- Maintaining a register of (aspiring) operators to facilitate matching with pool creators.
- Tracking reliability of oracle operators through on-chain monitoring and optional verification levels.
- Build documentation and infographics to educate and raise awareness

Contributes to security, at a higher level, by:
- Facilitating decentralisation of oracle operators
- Making it easier to "background check" oracle pools and oracle operators
- Empowering the broader community (KYA)

More info:

Hope I am not too late to the ErgoHack 3 party. 

I am proposing a project that uses Petri Nets as a tool to define and validate Smart Contract Protocol specifications (EIP-0006), for creation of headless dApps.
Formally, a Petri Net is a state transition graph that maps Places (circles) to Transitions (rectangles) and Transitions to Places via Arcs (arrows).
It is well suited for describing the flow of concurrent processes. This maps perfectly to the of Stages (Places) and Actions (Transitions)

Petri Nets are more concise than other process flow descriptions (like UML or BPMN) in that they have an exact mathematical definition of their execution semantics, with a well-developed mathematical theory for process analysis. Bounded Petri Nets exhibits Categorical Semantics in the way that concatenable processes, as strict Monoidal categories, model Net computations.

Because of its Markov property - states depend only on the current marking -  Stochastic Petri Nets are also used for validating and testing the Liveness, Boundedness and Reachability of distributed networks.

I have done previous work on Petri Nets using Scala, and I am looking for a team to help extend it  for use in specifying dApps for the Ergo Platform.

Hey! I'm SigmaValley dev. 
In this hackathon I'm working on interactive tutorials for dapp developers with nodejs/javascript stack exclusevely  - dAppstep

Javascript is the most popular language in web development with the most active ecosystem across the internet. 
Lowering the entry barrier for the army of javascript developers to create products on Ergo is my mission.  This is how we make Ergo dApps scene bloom! 

Most dApps don't need servers and dockers. We want to show what can be achieved with some javascript, react, and minimum serverless lambda backend.

My goal is to build a series of interactive editable dApp tutorials with open code that allows developers to learn any aspect of dApp development on Ergo:
1. Smart contracts with ErgoScript: debugging/developing circle, cheatsheet, 
2. Transaction assembling: send funds, send funds to a smart contract, mint token, release token from SC
3.  Interaction with Nautilus wallet API: Wallet login, list tokens, sign tx
4. Interaction with Explorer API.

Most tutorials will have fully functional dApps utilizing javascript tools only that users can interact with and modify in the browser.
Open code will allow devs to copy chunks of ready-to-use code to their dApps.
In browser ErgoScript editor with syntax highlighting and compilation errors.

*Looking for a FE dev*
I'm looking for a FE dev for a specific task at the moment - a react component for a transaction visualizer. For educational purposes, I want to visualize transactions used in dApps to lock tokens in SC, release tokens, and other things. If you feel like you have what it takes and ready to grab some prizes - DM me!

[05/10/2022 5:33 PM] digdug#5494
**Idea:** Magellan Nodes

**Problem: **Public Ergo Explorer does not have the bandwidth to support the growing number of dApps. As a result, dApps need to run their own instance of Explorer.  This can be time consuming, cumbersome, and delay potentially-promising dApps.
There is also a shortage of public Full Nodes on Ergo‚Äôs network.


[05/10/2022 5:34 PM] digdug#5494
**Solution:** Magellan Nodes.  A Magellan Node is a dockerized image of prebuilt Ergo Explorer and/or Full Node that can be pointed at to support network load for airdrops, mints, etc. 
In order to run a node, node operators will be required to stake ERG to a smart contract that in turn activates a license to operate the node.


[05/10/2022 5:35 PM] digdug#5494
**Tokenomics:** MAGE tokens will be distributed daily to Node Operators who meet the required uptime. The longer a node is online, the more MAGE can be earned (up to a certain percent of the daily distro.)


[05/10/2022 5:35 PM] digdug#5494
**Future plan:** Magellan Nodes will be free to use for the community, including dApp developers.  To support large projects or major events, Devs can reserve X amount of Magellan Nodes for their project in exchange for a pre-specified amount of MAGE.

[05/10/2022 5:56 PM] NoahErgo#4349
what is the use case of MAGE? Why does there need to be a token?


[05/10/2022 6:00 PM] digdug#5494
Good question, this was one of the main debate points in my mind for quite a while.
The conclusion I reached: Running a node, whether virtually or locally, costs money. In order to incentivize the node network to provide reliable service, the token "MAGE" is used. It also allows for future scaling operations should the demand for Magellan Nodes ever grow beyond the current natural rate of adoption.


[05/10/2022 6:01 PM] NoahErgo#4349
where will MAGE get its value though, you can't just say it has value haha


[05/10/2022 6:02 PM] NoahErgo#4349
If that is the model you want to adopt, there needs to be some external component that creates incentive for ownership of MAGE


[05/10/2022 6:03 PM] NoahErgo#4349
and pls dont say staking


[05/10/2022 6:06 PM] digdug#5494
The future use cases of the node network; in my mind, this is supporting DEXs and large airdrop projects. MAGE can be purchased and redeemed in exchange for "commercial" use cases of the node network.  The immediate timeframe would of course require that usage of the Magellan Nodes would be free for everyone, though.


[05/10/2022 6:09 PM] NoahErgo#4349
Interesting. Maybe write up a paper detailing how you see this working. I would expect in time this kind of infrastructure will be open source for everyone so there would need to be some edge that magellan nodes would provide to make people wantto buy in


[05/10/2022 6:12 PM] digdug#5494
For sure. I dont see how the node-as-a-service could work without a token, though I could be thinking too narrow.
When looking at the current space, Ergo itself has a major lack of public nodes and only one Public API Explorer.  People wanting to launch projects all must point to that API or build the Explorer on their own and hope their hardware is enough to scale to their project's demands.
Outside of Ergo, other blockchains usually rely on 3rd party websites that are swamped with ads, since the service they offer is "free" to the end-user

[05/12/2022 3:41 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
I wanted to do like a proof of work dex/bridge to evm


[05/12/2022 3:42 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
I have a pretty good back ground in evm dev and I was thinking the easiest way would be a burn contract that sends ‚Äúwrapped‚Äù or another version of the token that‚Äôs minted on evm chains


[05/12/2022 3:43 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
It‚Äôll allow ergos ecosystem more access to deep liquidity


[05/12/2022 3:43 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
Also a good way to introduce the platform to people who may not know about it


[05/12/2022 3:44 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
I‚Äôd say most people have heard of eth or btc


[05/12/2022 3:44 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
It could even be like doge/ltc mining


[05/12/2022 3:44 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
Same algo


[05/12/2022 3:44 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744

[05/12/2022 4:20 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
What's meant by a PoW dex here? Just a dex on a PoW chain, i.e Ergo? Or is it a dex whose token is distributed via PoW?


[05/12/2022 4:22 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
I was thinking the issues with worm holes and bridges and they are transfer points security wise. So if you isolated a dex that was a bridge and it‚Äôs transactions were on like a forked chain


[05/12/2022 4:22 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
Mining ergo could also give you the other token


[05/12/2022 4:22 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
Like when you script mine ltc doge


[05/12/2022 4:23 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
But the dex token has actual utility


[05/12/2022 4:23 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
It been a you participated in the validation that the bridging of the assets was successful


[05/12/2022 4:23 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
Then you add other utility‚Äôs ancillary


[05/12/2022 4:24 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
Like staking farming ect


[05/12/2022 4:24 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
Entertainment like lottery system and predictions


[05/12/2022 4:25 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
But like genosis predictions


[05/12/2022 4:27 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
So the dex would be on its own PoW chain and would act as a bridge between other chains like ETH? Along with the other utilities you mentioned ofc


[05/12/2022 4:29 AM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Would you be able to mine the token to exchange for other coins?


[05/12/2022 4:31 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
Yea


[05/12/2022 4:32 AM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
ü§îü§îü§î that sounds sooo cool


[05/12/2022 4:32 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
And maybe to mitigate centralization with pools you give the benefits to solo miners


[05/12/2022 4:33 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
So the mining reward now is like 63 ergo per block right so you give like 5 dex tokens as well for the bridge chain


[05/12/2022 4:33 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
It‚Äôs like a simplified version of harmony with all there shards


[05/12/2022 4:34 AM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Right.


[05/12/2022 4:34 AM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
That seems really interesting. Would be really cool to have an idea like that.


[05/12/2022 4:34 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744

Any frontend devs here? I have an idea for a miner governance playground simulator similar to the ageusd playground. @abchris would you be interested? Basically could have the different miner governance parameters, 10 (arbitrary amount) different mining pool nodes each with adjustable hashrate and each with their own gov parameters. Can run a simulation of an epoch and then at the end you can see outcome based on which pool minted which blocks over the epoch

Like the ageusd simulator: https://sigusd.abchris.xyz/

Noah, I love your idea!!!

I have no dev experience, but would love to drop my ideas on you regarding miner governance, and potentially join forces for the ErgoHack if your team is not full.

Awesome, what is your idea? Im still trying to assemble team cause I also have no dev experience üòÖ


[09/25/2022 5:09 AM] WilfordGrimley#0124
I want to find the best way to give each individual miner a vote on any peramiter that could be changed on chain even if the miner is participating in a traditional stratum pool, or in a collateralized smart pool.

My current thinking on the best way to implement this is an EIP that allows nodes to submit 'partial' votes. (For example: a pool could mine a block with 70% support in favor of a change to the network) 

This would remove one of the largest downsides to disabling non-outsourcability: pool majority censoring a true super majority.

If pools had a way to track how their miners want to vote on any given issue (GetBlok attempted this with EIP 27) and were enabled to directly report how their miners are voting we would make the chain more democratic, and give further power to miners. 
  
An end goal of such a change would be an easy to use front-end where miners could choose any number of perameters to support (up to the maximum allowed currently) and be shown any pools (stratum, plasma, collaterized smartpool or other) that vote similarly to the way that they do on those issues such that consensuses can be reached, and sidechains and velvet forks can happen intuitively. 

Such a front end could even be tied to a full or light node, and enable solo miners to create their own collateral pools if no one on the network is yet voting the way they intend to.

[10/11/2022 6:42 AM] Chris Ray#2713
Definitely looking for some front-end work familiar with Ergo, and as at @NoahErgo said not Hackathon related, however, it is tied to previous Hackathon of the past, backend of the project is ready for public testing and needs UI to come online, and the Exle social network is ready to start using the UI, we have had a couple hurdles lately and we need to get past them.

Hey guys!

I have some ideas for the upcoming Hackathon, very on-theme

Front-end and back-end help would be needed üôå

OR if you're an existing team: I can help with branding, marketing and socials

Good evening. I'm a reformed finance guy... done big5 audit, corp accounting, s&p500 c-suite finance, raised funds for startups, formed companies, run small biz, etc... would like to connect with another small group to develop a great concept


[01/20/2023 2:55 AM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#2653
@Foeniculum and @cannon I need a team to try and get a great concept off the ground, you gentlemen interested in helping?


[01/20/2023 2:56 AM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#2653
Also anyone else here that would be willing to put in front end and backend dev work


[01/20/2023 2:59 AM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#2653

I am working on a crypto wallet app with the Node/Vue/Electron framework. I also use Python, Java, Kotlin, and Flutter. I like to work on security related issues, authentication and privacy.


[02/02/2023 10:57 PM] lexton#4994
I also mine ERGO and I am reverse engineering the open source Ergo Wallet App on github.com, I'm looking to add features for miners

@lllllll can I DM you? I'm interested in building the Patreon model with Ergo project. @Jerry_slush would you be interested in meeting about this project.  Is there a voice channel on this Discord where people can meet?  I'd like to put together a roadmap for the project, overall objectives and what frameworks/languages will be used.


[02/08/2023 11:48 PM] wombo22#5461

[02/09/2023 12:21 AM] lexton#4994
Can we use Google Meet? that's what I use for my dev meetings but it would be nice to keep meetings on this discord. Can we use a separate text channel or maybe a new thread inside this channel?
