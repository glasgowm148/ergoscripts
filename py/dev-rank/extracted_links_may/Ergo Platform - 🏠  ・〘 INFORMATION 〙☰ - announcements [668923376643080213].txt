Whale has jumped out with ~100k ERG loss compared to v1. The reserve ratio is still very disproportionate to SigUSD utilisation.

If you stay in, you risk the bearwhale (or others) - Having a lot of space to short erg and lock the contracts.

Markets go up - markets go down. There is always risk. 99%+ of RSV holders should be able to withdraw with-profits right now.

Considering buying SigUSD to secure profits for bear market and solidifying the protocol going forward.

"We need content.

Would you be interested in helping put together content for the Hackathon. 

For content we are asking for all @Community Developer to prepare some video or instruction tutorial that may be useful to a new developer who is learning about working with Ergo. 

A screen recording/walkthrough/tutorial would be great. 

What are you working on? What have you learned? 

It is a good opportunity to share what you are building. 
 
Apologies for the last minute ask. We are trying to throw together an event on a short timeline. Kushti redirected me to try to help get things done. 

We are going to try to get things ready for launch by June 11th. 

Appreciate the help, if you are up to contributing some content please let me know @Armeanio "

Why Ergo? 

Ergo is the inevitable next step in the evolution of Proof of Work blockchain technology, designed for creating and implementing powerful, efficient and highly secure financial contracts.

It is an open-source, decentralized network that builds advanced cryptographic features and radically new DeFi functionality on the rock-solid foundations laid by a decade of blockchain theory and development.

Why choose Bitcoin or Ethereum when Ergo offers the best of both blockchains? Ergo utilizes the eUTXO model for enhanced privacy & scalability options while also employing expressive smart contracts for DeFi applications. Add our commitment to cross chain development and the future of blockchain seems pretty clear.

They can issue tokens to miners (on top of their normal ERG reward), can launch projects, distribute NFTs, and can use these features to create governance systems, with EIP027 soft-fork voting as the perfect real-world example.

Apologies for the ping @everyone but saves re-answering this question.

**Some recent changes to this Discord** - to help with the bloat, you can now enable channels individually. This is done from within the channels marked with the üöß emoji at the top of each category.

> The `BOT` messages you can see are messages being bridged from Telegram and other Discords. Please match your usernames on both platforms to have your avatar displayed on bridged messages.

**RECENT NEWS**
- **Ledger** in beta, join the Nautilus channel via #deleted-channel if you'd like to try it out! (Only Nano S supported during beta)
- new **website** is out! (with a referenced roadmap!) 
- **EIP-27** will activate block 777,212

+ More ecosystem updates than I can list here but the updated https://sigmaverse.io website should have you covered. (most should have a dedicated channel under #deleted-channel )

**ERGOHACK**
Whether it's the bottom or the bear ergo keeps building so join us in #deleted-channel as we begin our 3-week ERGOHACK-FEST in partnership with ErgoPad)

GuapSwap | Ecosystem Promo Month by Ergo Platform
GuapSwap: Ergo Decentralized Miner Profit Swapping Protocol In some tax jurisdictions, swapping mining profits incurs hefty tax events. Echoing the spirit of the Ergo Manifesto, if privacy is meant to protect the individual from society, then we believe that it is the miners right to be paid out in the token of their choice without having to incur a financial penalty from the government. We want to develop a profit swapping smart contract that can be used with any mining pool - smartpool or otherwise - to swap profits via ErgoDex. In this way, a miner is free from the burden of doing manual swaps and is saved from the additional taxable event. We see this as a great addition to the ecosystem as it improves the quality of life for ergo miners, freed from excessive taxation; increases transaction volume for both ErgoDex and the people running the off chain execution bots; and provides anyone implementing smartpools with the ability to integrate a new feature benefitting miners, thereby enhancing their attractiveness while adding to the decentralization of the blockchain. Team: AggerGakker#4449 GEORGEOUS#1661 Lgd#5847 Links: Twitter : @GuapSwapErgo Linktree: https://ift.tt/oXSO68V Mail: GuapSwap@protonmail.com Ergo Ecosystem Promo Month: Is an open opportunity for any project building something on Ergo to show off their work. We are not deciding which projects to showcase; it is open to all. For this reason, we must stress that you should do your own research and Know Your Assumptions. Projects may or may not be run by anonymous developers or have closed source code. Featuring on Ecosystem Promo Month is by no means an endorsement or a seal of approval from the Ergo Foundation or by this YouTube channel. Always Do Your Own Research. But also, enjoy the content that has been provided by the wonderful people who are building the future of the Ergo ecosystem. -------------------------------------- ERGOHACK FEST: https:/...

New channel selector feature roled out.

At the top of the channel list you should now be able to see `Channels & Roles` where you can customise which channels are visible to you. 

 If you click into the dropdown on the very top-right there is also a `Show all channels` selector.


[12/20/2022 2:34 PM] glasgowm#9381
@everyone 

If you're confused as to why there's loads of extra channels. It seems existing members can see all channels by default with this change. 

Simply navigate to the `Channels & Roles` option at the top of the channel list to pick what you want to see! 

We use these pings sparringly so if you've not looked at this server for a while make sure to check out all the dApps, dev tooling and infrastructure being built or head over to https://sigmaverse.io/

:ergo_orange: Weekly Dev Update - January 22, 2023:
https://youtu.be/TsaxuI6dBSs

:ergonaut: Weekly Community Chats are now held on Reddit! :ergonaut: 

Previously the chats were held on Telegram and Discord; this new format will allow for questions to be posted and responses can be made from the community and team members throughout the day.

Kicking off this new format, we're revisiting decentralized lending protocols. We are seeing a number pop up throughout the ecosystem including collateralized, uncollateralized and pool-based lending, plus the addition of options and bonds etc.

It is exciting seeing these products come to life on Ergo, if you have any questions for the teams or how they work, drop your questions on the link below and look out for the responses on Tuesday!

@aer45958 Hey, the ERGO app is in full release, not in dev mode

If you do not see it in the apps catalog, then your Ledger setup might need an update, if so, please check out the order and tips mentioned here: https://t.co/MTyfVKFNJB
