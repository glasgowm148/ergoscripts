https://t.me/+ziSfcLUfRtI2NzYy

This was the first internal(sh) team chat. It contains early promoters of the ecosystem, people from other projects/chains, people working on erg, etc.. It's used as a Marketing chat, similar to Sigmanauts but without the entry pathways with people added at random. 

#sigmanauts should still be the main place to discuss internal day-to-day stuff, but #ergonauts is handy as 'core team' is a bit more active there.

lets' have public marketing and also private-marketing channels ?


[01/21/2020 2:43 PM] mx#5165
there is social-marketing or maybe should be renamed to marketing?


[01/21/2020 3:03 PM] kushti#0978
I would prefer just marketing, or we can create such channel later


[01/21/2020 3:04 PM] mx#5165

so with new active members (bez is coming , @Richard Wild , @filippounits) and old awesome contributors (incredible @mx, Chinese wing consisting of powerful @Noah and @Justin1000 , and guru @Dmitry Meshkov ) let's try to do smart and coordinated campaigns. core developers can help with content and other means. For example, @morphic has something planned for the next Monday. @morphic go ahead!

Good call @kushti I have started a document that I will continue to work on tomorrow. Maybe better to have everyone add to it now as I'm very green, and need steer from everyone on how Ergo is structured. Think of it as an audit of how the project/brand/marketing is structured + what areas of focus we do/ would like to do.

I only just started and I'm grafting a lot of prior experience I have from ethereum and IOHK/Cardano, so some things might fit, other might not. The goal here is to get a clear picture of everything we want to do, who can have ownership of said thing, then a view to timelines.

i.e. Global meet ups. Who is responsible? How many per week should we have? How are these coordinated? Should we create a rep programme to accommodate this? What are our key global locations?


[01/22/2020 8:18 PM] Richard Wild#8481
Further to this I would like to ask everyone the following questions to help me on a broader-scale see if I can bring some deeper value to the project.

Currently, there is no real marketing budget, and no real marketing plan strategy. Marketing is kind of being done "on the fly" (ad hoc), people posting on social media, writing articles and so on. I guesse we might call this a "grass roots" approach. Besides that, also last Sep. we did do an an Ergo Asia Roadshow; Alex did Meetup presentations in Tokyo, Seoul, Ho Chi Minh, Hong Kong and Shanghai. Justin and I thought Alex doing these in person Meetups were very effective, the most bang for the buck, and we also think that this would be the best approach for marketing in the near term at least (of course better to also do other things, but limited budget).


[01/23/2020 6:05 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Those cost money. Each meetup cost us about US$5,000 (we wanted to do Singapore too but it was too expensive).


[01/23/2020 6:08 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Earlier in the year last year, we also did a couple of Youtube sponsored pieces (Bad Crypto Podcast/Youtube and for some reason I can't recall the other one).


[01/23/2020 6:09 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
And we did a few paid advertisements in China (Weibo posts, WeChat article and 8btc.com article), which of course costs money.


[01/23/2020 6:15 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
But currently it seems that the Ergo marketing "strategy" is just the grass roots approach as mentioned above + some ad hoc events. In particular, Alex is also planning to go to Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2020  (https://fc20.ifca.ai/) in Malaysia in mid Feb. and also probably do one Meetup on Shanghai around then. I was hoping Alex could also do Ergo Meetup presentations in Seoul and Beijing and maybe Hong Kong, but currently there is not budget for that.


[01/23/2020 6:22 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
@kushti pls correct me if this is off but as I understand the current Ergo monthly  spending budget is around:


[01/23/2020 6:23 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
18,000 EFYT for "salaires" for regular contributors (includes some coders and community/ marketing people).


[01/23/2020 6:23 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
US$10,000 for coding/platform development


[01/23/2020 6:25 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
If we are budgeting and spending US$10,000 / month for coding/platform development, should we also have a fixed budget for marketing?


[01/23/2020 6:25 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
(keeping in mind that Ergo is already a fully functioning mainnet, compared to other projects that spend obscene amounts on marketing and maybe only have a testnet).

[01/23/2020 6:27 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Or we should just hope that the current Grass Roots marketing approach + some ad hoc marketing spend (so far just for one conference and maybe one meetup for month of Feb) will be enough?

[01/23/2020 11:19 AM] kushti#0978
on marketing, we definitely need to have some budget for that, but lets' consider a plan first. bez is coming, he's in favor of grassroots marketing , reddit / twitter etc 

So please discuss a strategy, views are very different (as well as backgrounds), but that's actually very good.

Meanwhile, as we have news coming (DEX , roadmap for 2020), lets plan and do grassroot campaigns. in my opinion the problem is that we're spreading the content mostly within our community only which is making community growth stalling. I would like to propose to consider how to reach outer communities. 

Also, lets do AMA with ProBit and other things which are cheap and efficient. 

@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ it seems I'm going Malaysia and back only ((


[01/23/2020 1:04 PM] Richard Wild#8481
>Those cost money. Each meetup cost us about US$5,000 (we wanted to do Singapore too but it was too expensive).

@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ Wow, thats quite expensive?


[01/23/2020 1:06 PM] Richard Wild#8481

[01/23/2020 1:08 PM] Richard Wild#8481
Further to the above, I think once we have as much info down as possible in the doc (selfishly for my own understanding of things more than anything) Then perhaps we could then collaborate on listing items that could be cost effective for marketing, and a list of items that come at a cost + then the things we really must spend on.


[01/23/2020 1:09 PM] Richard Wild#8481
I would suggest we assign owners to the various areas, and agree on a project structure so that we have clear lines of responsibilities and outcomes once we have agreement on focus areas.


[01/23/2020 1:10 PM] Richard Wild#8481
I would like to suggest an "Ergo Representatives programme" (like we set up for Cardano - Cardano Ambassadors Programme)  I think it would be a boon for us to have persons across the globe that could help support a grassroots strategy.


[01/23/2020 1:15 PM] Richard Wild#8481 (pinned)
First, walk before we run, and get a clear outline of how things are in the document. Once we have all the information written, I would suggest we condense it down to a concise list of agreed strategy.

‚úÖ  1. Grassroots - cheap 
- Ergo Reps
- Meet ups
- Written blogs
- Demo videos
...

‚úÖ 2. Budgeted - low cost 
- Video content
- Hackathons
- ErgoCore team talks (conferences)

‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Must have - High cost 
- Advertisements
- Exchange listings

‚õî 4. Nice to have - Cant do, but would if we could. 
- Ergo Summit
- Lambos for everyone

on events I think it is better to try to get into conferences. e.g. for Instanbul Blockchain Economy I was proposed to get accepted into speakers if case of $3K+ sponsorship. Which is cheaper than $5K and also more efficient in terms of coverage

[01/23/2020 8:33 PM] mx#5165
Waves should have lots of contacts in this direction


[01/23/2020 8:54 PM] morphic#4133
if we are going to start more systematic and planned campaigns, I think we should have some kind of Buffer (or queue) of materials (newsbreaks), which is somehow scheduled as part of more broad activities. 
For example, if I have something to tweet, I should not do it right away, I need to put this tweet in a buffer so that you guys can decide when I should tweet it, now or later. And ergoplatform shouldn't tweet it on my behalf because my tweet is my tweet üôÇ 
And I think we shouldn't anounce new developments immediately after we have them. Because sometimes we can produce something for the next week, and sometimes we cannot. 
So in order to have stable stream of events it is better to have something in the buffer and use it at the right time.

[01/23/2020 8:56 PM] kushti#0978
@morphic you mean some big materials right ?


[01/23/2020 8:56 PM] kushti#0978
like security audit, Foundation announce, DEX announe ?


[01/23/2020 8:58 PM] morphic#4133
Yes, when some new artefact is created, something that people can read, use, etc.


[01/23/2020 9:00 PM] morphic#4133
So, daily tweets for example can also be used as preparation for big things, once you see them already in the Buffer, you can prepare your audience in daily ergo facts.


[01/23/2020 9:02 PM] morphic#4133
But, I suggest to discuss the strategy of such tweets here to not harm the upcoming campaign


[01/23/2020 9:02 PM] mx#5165
daily ergo facts are very cool, at least people will know what is box or Ergo`s capabilities, we should make also article based on this one https://www.coindesk.com/what-bitcoins-white-paper-got-right-wrong-and-what-we-still-dont-know

[01/23/2020 9:10 PM] kushti#0978
I also have an idea for a talk and also an article titled "What Are You Buying?" about assumptions you explicitly or implicitly making when but cryptocurrencies (and not only). Will explain why Bitcoin is still dominant and Ergo will be in the long-term )


[01/23/2020 9:12 PM] mx#5165
In current market conditions and existing economy model it will be like why are you buying stocks üôÇ


[01/23/2020 9:12 PM] kushti#0978
like in Bitcoin you have a minimum of assumptions (few basic crypto primitives, honest majority, no visible overtake from devs or miners)


[01/23/2020 9:13 PM] kushti#0978
and in other cryptocurrencies it is much more complicated (e.g. miners can introduce 12.5% dev fund on the way, Great Chancellor can propose DAO bailout etc)


[01/23/2020 9:15 PM] kushti#0978
and we we do understand this mechanics


[01/23/2020 9:16 PM] kushti#0978
we can replicate it with technically much better blockchain


[01/23/2020 9:16 PM] kushti#0978
i.e. Ergo


[01/23/2020 9:16 PM] kushti#0978
(in the long-term)


[01/23/2020 9:18 PM] mx#5165
from tech point of view yes it will be good article, otherwise stagnation in Bitcoin starts to be scary with liquid represented by untrusted exchanges taking over far from perfect lightning, well they said some time ago by themselves if lightning doesn`t work we will start over again üôÇ


[01/23/2020 9:23 PM] mx#5165
it will end like being not minimalist but primitively unique, liquid will deliver volume so everyone will be still happy i guess

I guess @Richard Wild nailed the problems we have very well (probably because of such impressive background). We need to formulate the vision behind Ergo. We need to find short and catchy stories. And then concrete and solid roadmap linked to the vision and the stories.


[01/24/2020 6:47 PM] kushti#0978
"Resilient Platform for Contractual Money" is not that good probably


[01/24/2020 6:47 PM] kushti#0978
"AAA class of PoW blockchains" also


[01/24/2020 7:14 PM] Richard Wild#8481
I do think it would help us define our unique selling propositions and aligning around them. We should be laser focused on areas that set us apart from the rest of the space.


[01/24/2020 7:15 PM] mx#5165
I am not surprised that a lot of people may not understand different things, lot of impressive, valuable things are not being understood by most people everyday also but there are always few that do and I believe that hashrate comes from those people and probably there is a lot more of it, It may be troblesome though for developers and people building things to wait for long time and this time is also limited a lot by treasury with existing conditions. So as for stories, projects usually pick features or feature, in case of Ergo there is plenty of uniqueness inside, best of its story is Sigma i believe which leads to building most of things possible in cryptocurrency world at the moment in full p2p style with privacy in mind


[01/24/2020 7:18 PM] mx#5165
noone at the moment is able to build trustless LETS system, multisig with no signers disclosure. trustless payment network,, real ring signatures preserving zero knowledge correct ?


[01/24/2020 7:19 PM] mx#5165
At least I don`t know any project in cryptocurrency who is capable of these things above Ergo


[01/24/2020 7:21 PM] mx#5165
Roadmaps are there from decade, Ergo can beat roadmaps by delivery only I believe


[01/24/2020 7:23 PM] mx#5165
Most of things are implemented, I think roadmap should be about showing these things to every joe in crypto where 90% are able to click only


[01/24/2020 7:24 PM] mx#5165
Centralized mixers go down, Ergo can have fully trustless one

[01/24/2020 7:32 PM] mx#5165
We are not living in times though when people will discorver it like Bitcoin, it is not event that can be repeated, most developers accepting ERGs are for sure waiting for market improvements also, we need to sell it as only programmable, survivable commodity with cash features

some comments:
1) markets: I think english-speaking and Chinese-speaking first. We have website and a lot of other resources translated into Chinese
2) on dev roadmap, we can do that next week.
3) I can do some presentation after the roadmap. Thought to draw some slides for investors anyway (Barry Silbert asked for that)
4) why Medium and not own blog? Medium has big enough internal traffic?
5) we have local threads on BCT in Deutsch, Italian, Spanish, Russian. Also topics on some other forums, in English and Russian
6) on paid AMAs on TG, there are few offers. also ProBit AMA is coming on Feb 6th
7) We have monthly ErgoCast, weekly updates like Charles is doing? 
8) Talking w. Sasha about possible ways of cooperation, but its going slow ( are you in touch with him these days? On IOHK, talks started just recently, but currently the company focused on delivering  stakepools & smart contracts into Cardano mainnet, so Charles said some partnership is possible in the second half of 2020 only.

@Richard Wild so "Ergo: Simple, Solid, Efficient, Innovative cryptocurrency" is not that catchy ?


[01/26/2020 2:52 PM] Richard Wild#8481
No so much about it being catchy. More that it needs to be unique.


[01/26/2020 2:53 PM] Richard Wild#8481
You could argue bitcoin or maybe another project could also be defined as: "Simple, Solid, Efficient, Innovative" These are not unique attributes. We need something that really stands out as different, unique.


[01/26/2020 2:54 PM] Richard Wild#8481
Do we have something(s) that *really are different* to the rest of the market


[01/26/2020 2:57 PM] Richard Wild#8481
i.e. Cardano we went with:

bitcion = 1st Generation (simple immutable money) 
ethereum = 2nd Generation (smart contracts)
Cardano = 3rd Generation (PoS, Haskell and peer reviewed science)


[01/26/2020 2:59 PM] Richard Wild#8481
Ergo = 3rd Generation (Revolutionised PoW, most secure in class smart contracts, peer reviewed science) 

 ... anything else that might be unique? Has to be something not found anywhere on the market


[01/26/2020 3:02 PM] kushti#0978
ain't generations sold also ?


[01/26/2020 3:02 PM] kushti#0978
to the moment


[01/26/2020 3:08 PM] kushti#0978
may be 
"self-sovereign money and financial contracts" ?


[01/26/2020 3:09 PM] kushti#0978
so Bitcoin is about self-sovereign money


[01/26/2020 3:09 PM] kushti#0978
Eth = decentralized computer for contracts


[01/26/2020 3:10 PM] kushti#0978
Ergo simplifies contracts, embedding them into money, and the money and the contracts are self-sovereign


[01/26/2020 3:13 PM] kushti#0978
@mx lets have more catchy and provocative twiiter, promotion messages or digest w. major updates in the pinned message , and also campaigns like daily ergo fact but no so techy


[01/26/2020 3:15 PM] kushti#0978
@Deleted User what do you think about airdrops? for Magnum the price would be 0.2 BTC + ergs for setup and promotion, they claim bots are mostly filtered out (3 out of 4 filtered in some campaigns, they have some examples)


[01/26/2020 3:34 PM] Deleted User#0000

[01/26/2020 3:50 PM] Richard Wild#8481
"self-sovereign money and financial contracts" 

self-sovereign money = bitcoin right?
financial contracts = ethereum?

Without labouring the point too much, I'm just trying to see if there is anything we can "own" and independently unique to Ergo. You will have someone or group of people say "yeah, well, self-sovereign money = bitcoin right?" and "So Ergo does financial contracts? Donest ethereum do that? I'll just stick with ethereum. It's number 2"


[01/26/2020 3:52 PM] Richard Wild#8481

[01/26/2020 3:57 PM] Richard Wild#8481
Why the name Ergo? What is the meaning behind it? Does it connect to the unique core properties?


[01/26/2020 4:01 PM] mx#5165
in Greek it is "work"


[01/26/2020 4:02 PM] Richard Wild#8481
Is that the reason it was chosen?


[01/26/2020 4:03 PM] Richard Wild#8481
--
The adverb ergo is a fancy version of "therefore." Use it as a connector between thoughts and sentences that logically follow. &/ or Ergo may refer to: A Latin word meaning "therefore" as in Cogito ergo sum. A Greek word Œ≠œÅŒ≥Œø meaning "work".


[01/26/2020 4:04 PM] mx#5165
yes but some interpret it as therefore also


[01/26/2020 4:05 PM] Richard Wild#8481
-- It's good... Ergo is a better bitcoin. Ergo = simplified contracts,(embedding them into money). So a better bitcoin *that just works* (work / ergo) It all makes sense. It's secure, safe efficient etc.


[01/26/2020 4:06 PM] Richard Wild#8481
*BUT* I know the competition also claim to be secure, safe, efficient have better smart contracts (maybe even more simplified contracts) also claim to be the next bitcoin..


[01/26/2020 4:06 PM] Richard Wild#8481
You see my point?


[01/26/2020 4:08 PM] Richard Wild#8481
I think we need to find (or maybe even consider a pivot) to something we can claim/ own and unique to us. Something nobody has done, said or communicated. A proposition that is interesting, gets peoples attention/ click. Makes writers want to write about. Something fundamental, innovative, clever, unique, interesting, sticky.


[01/26/2020 4:08 PM] Richard Wild#8481
I think the name Ergo could still "work" (pun intended üòâ

Ergo terminology: a Box and a Register
Ergo has Bitcoin-like UTXO transactional model: a transaction is spending one-time objects and creating new one-time objects. We call this object a box. A box is immutable object which could be only created or removed. A box is not simply a coin, rather, it is contains regist...

What would be useful - maybe a mind map of all the aspects of Ergo?


[01/26/2020 4:22 PM] Richard Wild#8481
Maybe a google doc not the best format to capture all of these properties.

@Deleted User what is MAU ? )

@Richard Wild a lot of food for thought, thanks for nailing down the proposition issue!


[01/26/2020 9:12 PM] kushti#0978
ok so while we continue to think about proposition, lets do something right now
1) @Deleted User any content we have to try to get into reddits ? 
2) lets do monthly digest to the end of the week
3) what kind of articles do we need to start writing right now? 
4) let me ask for CoinAll announcement date 

what else? 

I am worried that we're covering our own circle currently. AMA with ProBit is a good example how to get new people into the circle. but what can we do for the next week ?


[01/26/2020 9:19 PM] mx#5165
content from blog and github for example is very good but should be distributed in reddits to get new people, especially things like LETS, mixing, ico etc, monthly digests should be very good in Ergo`s case let`s say with one example of contract in each, youtube that`s rather only paid shilling, otherwise engagment on twitter


[01/26/2020 9:28 PM] mx#5165
if @kushti had time for one whole day of engagment during the week that would be very cool, after it is succesful and new members are there, amas, blog and other own sources will have more sense

FYI China is effectively "closed" for events until further notice due to the Wuhan virus.  7 day national holiday has been extended by the national government to 14 days to try to contain the spread if thevirus. So no meetups.

@kushti I thought we were going to leave out GJ.com since is seems not such a reputable exchange (people were having to wait a long time for withdrawals).... I remember that's why we did not include it in the exchanges web page https://ergoplatform.org/en/exchanges/

so I've done roadmap during this week, doing January digest. What can I do next week ?


[02/02/2020 9:11 PM] kushti#0978
I think the biggest problem we have now is that we're hitting Ergo circle mostly with current marketing efforts, and so circle is not growing. Ergo is going to be listed on CoinAll in Feb, and in case of getting 1000 users trading Ergo there, Ergo will be listed on OKEX. OKEX listing could be huge and opens possibilities to get listed on other major with much less hassle and also to get into CMC-top100 which will get us on complete different level. 

So I propose to spend February on creating some basic content for external circles (me, Cassius, morphic, amitabh) and push it through Reddit / TG / forums /etc (bez, boldT), and also around our circles. 

Also AMAs, let's try to do 1 or 2 in Feb. 

At the same time, lets work on clear positioning and updating the website. Current slogan "Resilient Platform for Contractual Money" is for nerds, probably, lets continue to iterate to find another one.

[02/03/2020 3:43 PM] mx#5165
What Is Smart Money?
Smart money is the capital that is being controlled by institutional investors, market mavens, central banks, funds, and other financial professionals. Smart money was originally a gambling term that referred to the wagers made by gamblers with a track record of success.


[02/03/2020 3:43 PM] mx#5165
sounds provocative for sure üôÇ


[02/03/2020 3:46 PM] hir0#9158
Yes üôÇ In the Google doc, I've said this  should remain implicit - which the 'smart' features of Ergo can be discussed in detail


[02/03/2020 3:47 PM] hir0#9158
```
Welcome to ‚Äòsmart money‚Äô

Multiple meanings:
Programmable money via smart contracts (this point is made explicit)
Smart money vs dumb money ‚Äì the big investors who are patient enough to wait for their opportunity and make profits (background point, left implicit)
```


[02/03/2020 3:48 PM] hir0#9158
Point would be that it is:
1) Intelligent, programmable, versatile
2) A smart choice for investors


[02/03/2020 3:48 PM] hir0#9158
Of course we don't shill 2 like that


[02/03/2020 4:07 PM] morphic#4133
Smart Money 2.0?


[02/03/2020 4:22 PM] hir0#9158
I kind of feel we should avoid any over-used buzzwords, anything 'innovative', 'next-gen', '2.0', etc. Not committed to Smart Money though, so if people have better ideas, say!


[02/03/2020 8:51 PM] kushti#0978
"Welcome to Smart CryptoMoney"? to highlight our achievements in crypto (sigma protocols etc)


[02/03/2020 9:05 PM] hir0#9158
Maybe... though I think all the crypto stuff will come in everything else üôÇ It's all crypto


[02/03/2020 9:06 PM] hir0#9158
I think the 'smart' angle has a lot going for it though, there are so many smart things (money, contracts, watch, meter, motorway, city, TV, home, hub...)  it's a good reference to make


[02/03/2020 9:06 PM] hir0#9158
Maybe just 'Welcome to smart crypto' but I liked the 'smart money' connotations


[02/03/2020 9:08 PM] hir0#9158
There is already a SMART crypto though, so we might compete in the search engine rankings against that


[02/03/2020 9:15 PM] kushti#0978

[02/03/2020 9:15 PM] kushti#0978
so just "Welcome to Smart Money" ?

[02/03/2020 9:24 PM] hir0#9158
If people really don't like smart money, then 'smart finance' might work. At this point, we risk this getting to be design-by-committee and taking forever to decide. I think if no one strenuously objects, we should go with one of these for the sake of getting things off the mark.


[02/03/2020 9:24 PM] hir0#9158
If it needs changing in the future, so be it - a rebrand isn't the worst thing to happen to a crypto

[02/04/2020 3:30 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Obvious that "Smart Money" here has double meaning.


[02/04/2020 3:30 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Normall smart money refers to institutional money in finance.


[02/04/2020 3:31 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
But here is also means smart (as in like  smart phone) programable money as  @hir0 already explained.


[02/04/2020 3:32 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
So its very clever. I like it.


[02/04/2020 3:34 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674

Nobody in our Chinese channels cares when I post anything. Why? Simple. They have been seeing my posts since last June and the ERG price is still consistently in the gutter. 

They want to see that Ergo is being adopted in real life use cases. Of course they also wouldn‚Äôt mind an ERG price pump too!

Other tokens would call these real life 3rd party use cases ‚Äúpartnerships‚Äù, like for example what Waves does:

[02/04/2020 7:50 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
But Ergo is decentralized so it would not be correct to call any 3rd party use cases an Ergo ‚Äúpartnership‚Äù. But instead, there would be announcements of‚Ä¶
‚ÄúABC 3rd party and XYZ dev team partner up to build AMAZING-USE-CASE on Ergo Platform‚Äù

So for example, a headline‚Ä¶
‚ÄúJapanese Sawayaka Foundation announces it is building a LETS system on top of Ergo Platform‚Äù (don‚Äôt worry that they are not building it yet‚Ä¶ all that would be needed really is their INTENTION to build, which could be explained in the text of the article).
~note, see here for LETS explanation: https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_04_22-lets/

[02/04/2020 7:50 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
As I understand, what a lot of the other coins do is an announcement like the above which is immediately followed by a price pump for the token in the market. Initially, the price pump might need some help, but this can be orchestrated with market making.

Once this happens, then KOL‚Äôs and traders become interested. Why? They see the relationship:
Partnership/use case announcement ÔÉ† price pump
A delicious pattern which can be repeated in the future, and at greater and greater magnitudes.

So after the first Ergo use case announcement, some KOLs/traders become interested (especially if there is follow up contacting them from the community) and acquire ERG.
Then another 3rd party use case is announced followed by another price pump.
**But this time the KOLS/traders will be anxious to help promote and so the price pump is not dependent on market making.

And a virtuous cycle is triggered.


[02/04/2020 7:51 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
But anyhow I think all of this is for later.

@kushti Well, this is  unfortunate situation I should say. How come that mostly useless academic term is more attractive to people than very practical construction which we can implement and use.


[02/06/2020 10:17 AM] morphic#4133
If the Cardano guys will popularise Mealy machines, then, when we come to the understanding of the machines, we will be followers. At the moment this is still our competitive advantage. So I suggest to educate people and explain why it is important.

- With as much socials (Twitter, Telegram, Linkedin, Facebook, reddit, others) we can try to use https://ifttt.com/ for a faster/easier/organized/cleaner shill of ERGO post/news. The service is free and very powerfull;

- Add the push notification @ Blockfolio Signal. Here https://blockfolio.com/signal. Blockfolio is one of the most downloaded crypto-related app for ios and android. Dozens of other similar apps exist and it's well known that a large part of the traffic come from mobile devices;

It was popular back in 2016-17 to consider some insane and non-financial contracts on top of the "blockchain" (often, a permissioned one). We explicitly said back then that contracts should be tied with money, or no reason to have them on a public blockchain

Interesting project https://filecoin.io/  
They rely on Ethereum as a Contracts platform. 
I think we can consider integration with Filecoin so that Ergo dApps can store data in IPFS with guarantees of replication and persistence (this is what Filecoin adds on top of IPFS)
By default IPFS doesn't guarantee your data will persist, unless somebody "pin" them

So we need some marketing material for BPSAA to announce Ergo partnership. One short description like here --> https://bpsaa.vision/members and another coin-specific description like here --> https://bpsaa.vision/ether1  I can create something based on existing Ergo announcements but if you have anything specific, please infor me

I was thinking that it may be worth releasing a piece on the Ergo blog about what oracle pools mean for the future of the Ergo ecosystem.

The announcement we'll (Emurgo) release on the 28th isn't going to be super technical/full of details, so maybe it would makes sense to have an Ergo-specific blog post we release on the following week about how oracle pools aid in building out the future of DeFi (with facts like anyone can use the oracle pools via data-inputs, thereby opening the doors wide for developers to jump in and use the oracle pools without being stuck behind a pay-per-use wall to acquire data for their dApp)

Is the thing about nanopools inflating their hashrate true? Don't want to tell people if it's not. If it is - can we adjust anything to display their true hash so they're not at 51%+ (or less than what they are currently)

[05/24/2021 4:34 PM] Armeanio#0321
We have a few new pool providers that are in the process of creating new pools. With autolykos being profitable I hope this issue may naturally be resolved as things come online.

@glasgowm We need to hire potentially up to 4 full-time people: 
1) Core Dev for Ergo Node, 
2) Core Dev for ErgoScript  compiler/interpreter 
3) Technical Writer to create and maintain Developer Portal
4) Devops engineer to maintain all server and tooling infrastructure
What would be the best repository to commit Job Descriptions?


[07/23/2021 4:39 PM] glasgowm#9381
Maybe awesome-ergo? Might get lost on grow-ergo.


[07/23/2021 9:51 PM] morphic#4133
I was not clear enough, sorry. Do we have a repository where I can put markdown files with job descriptions, so that others (you, @kushti etc) can review/edit/approve them before the final publication elsewhere?


[07/24/2021 4:12 PM] glasgowm#9381
Not that I'm aware of? Want me to make one up on mine?


[07/24/2021 4:29 PM] glasgowm#9381
Happy to help but I don't have access to the ergoplatform git so unclear why you're asking me (unless I'm missing something)


[07/25/2021 11:18 AM] morphic#4133
Ah, it looks like I'm missing something since I'm not involved in ergonauts work. 
In EF we had a preliminary agreement that we need to hire more devs. I was advised to create JD and contact ergonauts in search for a help to organise hiring. Would be really cool if you and Angie organise search of new candidates so that we (me and kushti) could choose from and do an interview.
I created the JD for Compiler Engineer position (for ErgoScript compiler and interpreter). But we also need Tech Writer and Core Dev for Ergo Node.


[07/26/2021 9:46 AM] glasgowm#9381
Cool, I've created a private repo here and invited you and kushti to push drafts to

https://github.com/glasgowm148/ergo-jobs

I'll liaise with Angie and see how best to push


[07/28/2021 12:04 PM] morphic#4133
Created a PR there, but maybe ergo-grow is a better place for this


[07/28/2021 12:06 PM] glasgowm#9381
Put them on ergo-grow when they're finalised? This is a private one to review/edit/approve before final publication


[07/28/2021 12:07 PM] morphic#4133
I think we can do all review/edit/approve in public.


[07/28/2021 12:08 PM] morphic#4133
Anyway, it is up to the ergonauts team to decide.


[07/28/2021 12:13 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah sure just keeping it all on `grow-ergo` suits me


[07/28/2021 12:20 PM] morphic#4133

I think Jennie D, Juan and Marcelo should be rewarded (not sure if Marcelo already is being so from his work with ergodex). 

Jennie runs a insta for us and is super active on twitter (a little too active as you might see lol)
Juan does the graphics for the blog, and is very active in community marketing as well as doing his NFTS. (I suggested he make up ones for the regional chats). But despite how active he is - he only holds 150 erg so far.
And well, marcelo's graphics speak for themselves and I think we should have him as our main designer. 

kushti said he'd jump on bounties soon so they can be taken out that - just putting it here for discussion/so I don't forget. 

Juan also said he put a proposal into the EF so would be good to get a response to him (if that's not already done).

Hi, guys, I noticed the Developer stats on coingecko is poor https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ergo#developer 
At least sigmastate, appkit, sigma-rust repos need to be added there.


[08/19/2021 1:36 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
it only shows the main repo, and only it's main branch while the development is done on other branches


[08/19/2021 2:50 PM] morphic#4133
for Ethereum it shows many repos, for Bitcoin it also shows 2 repos


[08/19/2021 3:37 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
so it is possible, good to know!

What is going on with the derived address issues? Never used to be a problem but seems constant now.

By this I mean people restoring their wallets and not seeing their funds - because it's on a derived address within the same wallet which isn't being linked up by Yoroi. Is this anything to do with Ergo or should I be opening bug reports with the yoroi guys?


[08/28/2021 2:15 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
for me it feels like ergo node switched back to non-eip3 addresses


[08/28/2021 2:15 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
because Android and Yoroi use eip3 addresses and people complain that node address is different

Hey all, I‚Äôve been setting up a new Ergonauts server. My aim is to bridge the existing internal telegrams allowing people to stay on telegram if they prefer. I think the existing discord is best used for public/development - and this one more for a mix of prominent community members, contributors, ambassadors, potential partners, along with the core team/devs - with tiered permissions for sensitive information

Oh, one more thing, reckon you would have some info. Being a startup on the edge of Europe it is pretty much a struggle month to month. If there are any grants to be had, pushing that angle would allow us to divert more time&resources to this tech. Now, I do not need a commitment of any kind, but I would like info on how to apply if they exist and all that jazz, so we could maybe apply after we drop some cool .net ergo stuff :).

I told him he could send any formal proposals to the email. But passing this on in case you or @kushti had any better ideas of how to utilise them.

Yeah, we are now pushing to get to to .net nativly understanding ergo blocks with the end goal of having a .net interpreter that can both understand&write complex smart contracts. Pack that up with a user friendly wallet and I think that would be a first :D

Plus, I reckon having a decent .net lib for people to lean on will allow for a rapid ecosystem expansion in the .net space :) plans are to keep everything open source and available to all

Hello,

We've just released our multichain multisig wallet WH Cypher and looking for new projects to cooperate with.

Our multisigs are based on Threshold signature schema and looks like a single user transactions on blockchain. Here is an example of transaction signed jointly by 2 users on Binance Smart Chain

https://bscscan.com/address/0xaa19ab731f7087cc544beb62b3a4abd872a3803b

We currently support secp256k1 and ECDSA signatures, but from what I learned ERGO replies on this cryptography. 

We also just launched a non custodial crosschain swap platform WhalesHeaven. Currently we support Bitcoin, Ethereum + ERC20 tokens. We will release Binance Smart Chain + BEP20 support this week. This month we plan to add Avalanche, Matic, Litecoin and Doge. 

Let me know if you would be interested in cooperation.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Max
Founder and CEO

@kushti_ru why did you decide to build a Solana bridge before a Cardano bridge?


[01/11/2022 12:44 PM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
Question from the community


[01/11/2022 12:55 PM] glasgowm#0000
Forwarded from mhs_sam: we had the gravity bridge and the susy team is mostly the same as the gravity team. So using the susy to bridge was the best choice to deliver a bridge at the minimum amount of time.


[01/11/2022 12:55 PM] glasgowm#0000
Forwarded from mhs_sam: we're done on our side and the contract and services are complete and under review. So it mostly depends on the susy side to integrate the bridge. should be quick


[01/11/2022 12:55 PM] glasgowm#0000
Forwarded from glasgowm: Is SuSy the SOL part of Wormhole or something?


[01/11/2022 12:55 PM] glasgowm#0000
Forwarded from glasgowm: or why SOL over ETH?


[01/11/2022 12:55 PM] glasgowm#0000
Forwarded from mhs_sam: I'm researching some bridge options and will decide and start implementing one of them after finishing the susy one. so now let's focus on the susy


[01/11/2022 12:55 PM] glasgowm#0000
Forwarded from mhs_sam: susy is like gravity while the consensus and logics takes part on solana network rather than a complicated and multi-layer gravity one.
so there are no need for lots of contracts on ergo or any other chains to manage the bridge. simply each new network must implement the IB and LU ports (issue/burn, lock/unlock).


[01/11/2022 12:55 PM] glasgowm#0000
Forwarded from mhs_sam: SOL is their choice due to it's low fees


[01/11/2022 12:55 PM] glasgowm#0000
Forwarded from mhs_sam: the current agreement is to bridge from solana to ergo (one way) and there will be about 7 tokens like usdt, btc, sol, eth, uni, link, gton,... to be available on ergo (one by one).
There is no obstacle to have the other side of bridge from ergo to solana, since the services and contracts are available. We will discuss this with them as soon as the first milestone is live.


[01/11/2022 12:56 PM] glasgowm#0000
^ mhs_sam explains here, SOL was their choice due to low fees (re @DanielTetsuyama: @kushti_ru why did you decide to build a Solana bridge before a Cardano bridge?)


[01/11/2022 12:59 PM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
@glasgowm can you do me a favor and just sum it up more succinctly for Twitter? Or maybe if you have a link to a convo I can post


[01/11/2022 1:32 PM] glasgowm#0000
‚ÄòSOL was the choice of the @SusyOne team due it‚Äôs low-fees, this bridge will bring ~7 tokens over from SOL, with further expansion plans in the works‚Äô

[01/11/2022 3:09 PM] veriumfellow#0000
Yes, mainly extra slow. When restoring a wallet all tokens  were not visible, I had to move them in the old Yoroi to a new address in the same wallet so that they all appeared in the restored version of the same wallet on another browser. The ERG balance was correct though. (re @kushti_ru: Any concrete bugs?)

It's also nice to reinforce the idea that ergo and cardano are not joined at the hip, the more ergo is bridged to other chains, the more people can move on from that narrative that ergo is somehow part of the wider cardano ecosystem

[01/11/2022 8:33 PM] mhs_sam#0000
sorry I saw your question right now.
why not cardano? since when we begun builing the bridge there was no smart contract on cardano. That's the cause. 
Building the bridge took a long time, I'm really sorry for that. There was lots of reasons which I do not want to explain here.
We started again with the SOL bridge when cardano had the sc. but, the sol bridge was selected since the researches and codes was reusable and the bridge could be made quickly.
I think cardano bridge will be the next one. (re @DanielTetsuyama: @glasgowm can you do me a favor and just sum it up more succinctly for Twitter? Or maybe if you have a link to a convo I can post)


[01/11/2022 8:41 PM] mhs_sam#0000
back to Gravity, ergo was the first (e)utxo chain to be integrated. If the gravity project was live now, building cardano-gravity bridge was a matter of weeks. This way, the ergo and cardano could be bridged to lots of chains and to each other. Unfortunately, the Gravity team had been failed with the bridge and ergo-gravity failed as a result.
I think, when we finish the ergo-sol bridge, the cardano-sol bridge would be easy. Making both chains connected to each other, SOL, and possibly other chains.


[01/11/2022 8:46 PM] glasgowm#0000
How's testing going? (re @mhs_sam: back to Gravity, ergo was the first (e)utxo chain to be integrated. If the gravity project was live now, building cardano-gravity bridge was a matter of weeks.

all good on our side, test VAAs (verifiable action approval) are being recieved and the whole process is done. There are still doing some optimizations and improvements which is not important.
On the other side, they was somehow cofused about how eutxo smart contracts work. Yesterday, we had a meeting and lots of their questions is addressed now. Tomo, we have another meeting regarding the oracles and maybe other stuff.
The remaining part is the oracles, which they was implementing in their nodes in order to fetch data from Ergo. It's easy btw.

Ergonauts Bi-Weekly Call 12 Jan 2022
Angie:
-Just come back to my desk. We had a talk with our Editorial team
-We are working on twitter telegram medium web blog. Focusing on the content planning and the updates. We are going to change our twitter policy. I will deliver it today. I will also deliver Telegram vision. We want to change our focus and design of telegram group. To make more unique content and make it educational. We are working with a new writer.
-We are launching our medium, initially it will mostly duplicate our main blog. Then we will change the main blog a bit.
-We are launching a contributors program, there are many people but the quality is not very good. We will create guidelines and we will be able to deliver specific texts on different channels.
-We had a talk with Andy, we will make few videos with influencers. We are selecting appropriate channels for January and February. This week we will know which channel to launch first. 
-Our marketing timeline for 2022 is almost ready, we covered basics. We are working with marketing agencies. We will have a talk, maybe tomorrow. We will talk about branding and corporation policy. 
-Will hold the hackathon privacy event. We have a few submissions already and our goal is to remind everyone about the hackathon and prolong the registration period if needed. But I think we need to accept everyone who wants to participate. We have at least 5 subscriptions right now.
-We are following up our participants about privacy summit. Results are not good for now, I think because of dates. We will remind the people that we are waiting for the videos so follow up will come.
-This month we will push our educational partnerships with universities. We will talk with Daniel very soon. We want to be supported by multi-universities.
-For the January we will focus mostly our basic communication planning and branding we are planning to have it by the end of Fe <clipped message>

Armeanio:
-I have few of spending proposals on Forum, let's take a look today
-Looking for bank in Bahamas regarding Foundation funding. We made a lot of progress about financing procedures. There‚Äôs a bottleneck to get a corporate account
-I have a couple of meeting with potential partnerships, I have a meeting with Ledger and they fixed the bug and Yoroi and Android wallet will come in relatively soon time-frame
-Making videos and doing interviews for looking into the economics of storage rent. Also to get out the real information, I am publishing about EIP0027
-To get listed in exchange we have to follow some procedures about the localization of exchanges. I am also working with a firm in Malta, to learn how Ergo can fit 
-We will be talking on Son of a Tech‚Äôs podcast. we will continue talking about EIP0027 
Glasgow:
-Past week I mostly work on design for new websites
-Checking around Discord and Telegram groups 
-I posted the Incubator post for looking out ErgoHack
-Next weeks I will be doing the content with ErgoHack
Sakata:
-I was wondering about possibly renaming ErgoSummit, Summit is for conventions and conferences online. Possibly we can tying it with a space thing like Sigmaverse.
-I proposed to Alex that I had the idea for code name convention for Ergo Node, each main release will coincide with the hardening update that we had last year. 
-In addition to those 2 ideas, we had a day for the ErgoCast which will be Monday
-What's the topic for the ErgoCast, we will be talking about networking. Komodo will come talk about notarization and about the DEX. I am not sure where the scope goes. If you have any ideas, let me know
Glasgow: networking ErgoPad?
Sakata: I am talking about more like p2p communication kind of thing
Anastasia:
-Updates from my side, I completed the financial report for 2021, we are doing with Ergo Foundation
-I will be preparing new reports for 2 weeks of January and it <clipped message>

root7Z:
-We had a talk with the editorial team. Building for the content plan
-I had my final exams so I was busy last week, I will focus again on new content creation
-Checking with Matthew for ErgoSummit participants, not many response. I will try to finalize this week, then I will be making contact with Andy.
-About ErgoHack, I agree with Mark's concerns that people do not have ideas about Privacy & Security theme so as Angie said it's a good idea to check it by next weeks to see if we are having a good return and if not maybe we can accept other projects.
-Next 2 weeks is important, I will help finalize the preparation of ErgoHack and ErgoSummit events

@kushti_ru (from @justin1000 in Discord foundation channel)
need to go back and ask the pools to confirm if they are voting in favor of the fork. But I can‚Äôt just ask them‚Ä¶I need to tell them some new info at same time. Just a few short bullets is fine. Can you confirm the below:
*Voting will commence on schedule on block 666,625 (699,393 ‚Äì 32,768) which is expected to start on next Tuesday (~6.6 days from now), correct?
*You will provide detailed specific instructions to pools on process, correct? On what day can you provide these instructions?
That is probably all I need to know to ask them their final views. If you want, you can let me know if they will need to upgrade their node ahead of the vote? Or if they just need to upgrade their node between blocks 699,393 and 732,161 during the activation period? But these details not really needed for this purpose.


[01/16/2022 10:07 AM] Noahneng#0000
Is the vote going ahead per schedule and do miners know how to vote? Don't think I have seen any update?


[01/16/2022 10:07 AM] Noahneng#0000
@kushti_ru I just want to make sure everything is on schedule and miners either know how to vote or will be told before vote starts before we go back to mining pools and ask them to confirm their position. Else we can annoy them, lose credibility etc and make this all harder.  Some pools already asked before how to vote so apparently don't know.


[01/16/2022 10:48 AM] kushti_ru#0000

I think we need for non-standard activation to use standard one for 5.0 activation.
I think we can do indicative voting, starting from tomorrow. If hashrate polling will show 90+% hashrate support, we can do activation via a releasing a special version,that is more of less okay I guess (re @Noahneng: @kushti_ru I just want to make sure everything is on schedule and miners either know how to vote or ...)

Indicative voting for EIP-27 soft-fork proposal
Dear Ergo miners!  It seems after the hard-fork no changes in parameters were done, maybe because it was not known to the new generation of miners how to do that. Back in 2019, I provided some instructions on how to change block-related limits (see e.g. [Voting proposal] Increasing maximum computational cost for block ).  Voting on parameters al...


[01/18/2022 12:05 AM] glasgowm#0000
Is that the voting live now for 32 epochs (32,768 blocks ~ 46 days)? And requires 50%+ of blocks mined within those epochs? (re @kushti_ru: https://t.co/k03PmwKLbo)


[01/18/2022 9:20 AM] kushti_ru#0000
No, we will see block cost limit parameter being changed. Votes will appear if at the first block of an epoch a miner will put a vote into block header. Block cost limit will be changed if more than 50% of hashrate vote for it over an epoch. (re @glasgowm: Is that the voting live now for 32 epochs (32,768 blocks ~ 46 days)? And requires 50%+ of blocks min...)


[01/18/2022 9:22 AM] kushti_ru#0000
Block cost limit can be raised by 1% per epoch, so we will have about 17days of gauge voting


[01/18/2022 9:22 AM] kushti_ru#0000
And we can get concrete support %% from block headers


[01/18/2022 9:26 AM] glasgowm#0000
17 days from now the vote ends? (re @kushti_ru: Block cost limit can be raised by 1% per epoch, so we will have about 17days of gauge voting)


[01/18/2022 9:30 AM] kushti_ru#0000
Not quite, vote for block cost limit happens every epoch. And for every epoch we can get support %%

[01/18/2022 10:00 AM] justin1000#0000
@kushti_ru I don't think your intentions are that clear to most people. Is it the case you want to use this mechanism as a way to find out in a very reliable way current miner support for the fork and then decide next steps? That makes sense and we can tell pools to indicate their interest that way. One negative to doing it this way though we should just be aware of is that some pools have already complained the process is difficult and this adds an additional step.


[01/18/2022 10:02 AM] kushti_ru#0000
Yes, this is indicative voting only for now, not causing any activation.

Dear Nanopool, as you may know, EIP-27 emission prolonging soft-fork is hot topic in the community now, especially around miners. Some pools already made polls to get miners opinion. Now it is time to signal (or not) support for EIP-27.
The voting is not causing any activation, so just indicative. We will just check support and then decide how to activate or make a voting with activation.
To vote on EIP-27, please vote on insignificant (~15%) increase for block cost limit. Details are in https://www.ergoforum.org/t/indicative-voting-for-eip-27-soft-fork-proposal/3259

Indicative voting for EIP-27 soft-fork proposal
Dear Ergo miners!  It seems after the hard-fork no changes in parameters were done, maybe because it was not known to the new generation of miners how to do that. Back in 2019, I provided some instructions on how to change block-related limits (see e.g. [Voting proposal] Increasing maximum computational cost for block ).  Voting on parameters al...

Kicking things off with Nautilus wallet, since their tweets gained a lot of traction lately; this should help give a quick elevator pitch of the wallet

A similar solution for Ergo would make the development of a wallet with a good performance much easier. 
I talked with a creator of https://raywallet.io and he said that this solution allowed them to significantly improve performance and speed up the development of their wallet. 
Yoroi's performance issues are mostly caused by an inefficient scheme of queriying blockchain data.

Much needed. Lots of time was taken from us during the bridge development since there was no RPC for ergo node. The same for stratum server.
I think adding RPC support to either node or explorer, and adding Graphql support to the explorer is needed. I would say that Graphql is a priority though and can be achieved sooner. (re @oskin: https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/ogmios

I would like to give a more elaborate explanation as to why Sigma Protocols make the Ergomixer more efficient than its competitors, however the explanation given in the blog doesn't really talk about the specifics

[01/26/2022 2:05 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
No, it is still a manual setting with your node as the default. Still need to change that. By the way, is there any API returning the public nodes? I know about the conf setting file but that's static (re @kushti_ru: Are you doing round Robin?)


[01/26/2022 2:07 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
but the user said he tried different nodes so it seems the others aren't completely synced?

[01/26/2022 2:09 PM] Luivatra#0000
Maybe it would be good to spin up a node dedicated to the wallet, these public nodes are always going to be targets for attacks (even if that is not the case right now)

-We are working with Singapore to be tax compliant as Ergo Foundation
-We've been in contact with Son of Tech regarding EIP27, Kushti will join to a podcast
-Increasing partnership meetings, sidechain meetings can bring funding
-Hackathon is going, I will ask Angie to see what support is needed
Angie:
-I proposed to go through ErgoHack schedule. It starts on 11th Feb. There are two videos scheduled; one is welcome video from Alex and one as a AMA with Dan and Joseph. I'm hoping for a special guest, I am talking with Armeanio to have wallet dev as guest. Special AMA
-Second day we scheduled web seminar. We are talking with Benjamin. The same day I'm planning an event for interaction, we are talking with Sigmavalley. I will have updates this week. Open for proposals on this,  about metaverse space or some other interaction ideas. We may replace Sigmavalley. In the end we'll have 1 web seminars or if there is anyone who have expertise on privacy, this slot is open.
-3rd day we are planning to make a guest interview and a closing video from Kushti. The schedule is this, shared in telegram group. Please discuss if there is anything to change
-For privacy event, we are getting more videos. It's about 5 now, we are about to ask assistance to push for partners. We have basic amount of videos but it's better to push it next week
-Andy updated that he is collecting a quiz to make for a privacy event. We can maybe make an NFT drop devoted t <clipped message>


[01/26/2022 3:27 PM] root7Z#0000

Next ErgoHack?
Kushti: Next ErgoHack with a partner - with ErgoDEX? ErgoHack on tokenization apps on ErgoDEX maybe with ErgoPad, the sooner the better.

Armeanio: Kushti I will send you meeting with IOG 9AM 
Kushti: tomorrow I will be half day of, will be available during weekend 10 AM works 
Armeanio: Works for me
Andy:
-We got the videos working inside twitter. It was an extreme success 7-8k views, we managed to to how to make it embedded. There are a lot views coming so it has a lot of potential. It was kind of tricky and we figured it out, Sean figured out how to do it on Twitter.
-Chasing people people to make them videos for summit. They say they will do, but then they don't
Armeanio: It will be more efficient if we make a group call and record it
Andy: People need to come up with content and there are some people who didn't reply, some people say they are busy. We already make 1 month time but still low return
Armeanio: If we just make it like a group call and we ask questions it might be easier.

I'm afraid this image makes more trouble in the future again.
specially the second bullet saying ergo will release three projects on cardano: ergodex (okay), ageusd, and oracle pools.
At least more clarification is needed.

[01/29/2022 10:40 AM] Luivatra#0000
I am sure 99% of requests to the explorer api are from dapps, so if we can cut that away the public explorers should be fine


[01/29/2022 10:40 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
wallet requests will be a lot as well.

[01/29/2022 12:36 PM] eilemust#0000
I don't think it's a silver bullet. The problem is that we don't have disk space monitoring on our explorer servers, we just need to add it first.
There are now more than 80% free disk space on each of 3 servers, I think this will be enough for years. (re @kushti_ru: We can add third server in coming days)

- We have a discussion about Ergo Course that will be regarding our hackathon participants and teams. We will try to conduct a library for future onboarding developers. February, we focused on educational aspects and content creation. We have one journalist writer sticking to tending topics for medium channels.

some corrections/additions - maybe Wigmanauts is a better name though üòÖ
Glasgow
- Getting Discord up to scratch for ERGOHACK III
‚Äî Added reaction roles to tidy it up a bit
‚Äî Set up channels/roles for hack
‚Äî ergo-dns gained 4 members, 11 teams total I think (HYPO10 TBC)
‚Äî Also added lots of regional channels. WIP with ambassadors/sigmanauts
- Fleshing out ergodocs for hack + node barrier of entry
- Promoted some SIGCANs and admitted some new ones. 31 Sigmanauts + 23 SIGCANs. People are starting to step up a bit and do stuff - DAO release/setup should give people a bit of agency.
- ERGOHACK graphics, promotion
- pushing dev bounties
- carl-bot on Discord (management)
- r/ErgoNewsFeed for logging articles
- updated CMC
- New telegram quiz bot (seems to have solved most of the spam in #support)
- Working with webdev. Got access to git but not moving as quick as i‚Äôd hoped. Will chase. (re @root7Z: Ergonauts Biweekly Call 09 Feb 2022

[02/09/2022 3:03 PM] AndyLowe#0000
Hello all, apologies the zoom thing failed. I set it to have no waiting room, so I'm not sure why it didn't work. 
My updates;
Ergohack videos are all ready, apart from one from luivatra that was just submitted today. I will schedule them all in accordance with the timetable. 
Additional Hackathon video was made yesterday by @kushti_ru and @Armeanio and it makes sense to post it soon, will discuss with Angie.
Summit videos are coming together, a couple of videos are in, and there are 2 more that promised to send them today. I can process them quite quickly and get them ready for YouTube, but still it's preferable not to have them all at the last minute. So I think it will be ok. 
I am also creating a quiz using Google forms, to encourage people to learn from the hack and summit and test their knowledge. @glasgowm agreed a prize of 100erg (10erg each for 10 winners) of the quiz, to incentivize participation and learning. 
Have been in touch with some YouTubers trying to build relationships for future collaborations, got a nice reply from CTO Larsson who did a review of Kadena (said it was shit) so I said he should try ergoscript and make video. Also Max maher has replied to me with a concept for a video with @kushti_ru, so now the microphone and camera is set up, it can happen hopefully soon. So I am making progress there.
GetBlok Pulse was a success
YouTube channel passed 4000 subs
Also, made video for Nautilus wallet which was cool

I think so, but this has been an ongoing discussion for a bit.  
Anyway multiple open source solutions are a good thing for competition/growth/evolution. (re @NoahErgo: interesting, aren‚Äôt a bunch of devs on this for ergohack already?)

Hoping the handle solution solves the fake NFT issue.
 If the AH or new NFT marketplace can call the handle instead of the wallet address, it could be a big improvement. (re @NoahErgo: interesting, aren‚Äôt a bunch of devs on this for ergohack already?)


[02/10/2022 8:16 AM] CMParada#0000
Guys in the very beginning of the project we established that this kind of announcements should use some specific backgrounds to reinforce brand recognition, I remember making a few different versions but i guess as more and more people were added to the core group the idea  faded away, I will leave below one of them (one I could find) and i would recommend to use it, but ultimately is up to you.

This is their announcement (re @CMParada: Guys in the very beginning of the project we established that this kind of announcements should use some specific backgrounds to reinforce brand recognition, I remember making a few different versions but i guess as more and more people were added to the core group the idea  faded away, I will leave below one of them (one I could find) and i would recommend to use it, but ultimately is up to you.)


[02/10/2022 9:19 AM] CMParada#0000
I know G - just dropping that there in case you guys wanna use that's all.


[02/10/2022 9:21 AM] glasgowm#0000
We use ones when we publish our announcements but this was on their end so nothing faded.

Is it possible to add tail emotions to ergo via smart fork in the future as mining emissions run out? If the community was interested in this


[02/13/2022 1:16 AM] NoahErgo#0000
isnt that what the current EIP-027 is about??


[02/13/2022 1:16 AM] martyergo#0000
No that's just lengthening the emission schedule by a bit


[02/13/2022 1:16 AM] martyergo#0000
Tail emissions would add some level to erg generation forever


[02/13/2022 1:17 AM] Arohbe#0000
Well it‚Äôs actually storing erg in storage boxes to be distributed to miners once the emission schedule ends.


[02/13/2022 1:17 AM] martyergo#0000
It creates a scenario called dis-inflation, where the rate of inflation declines over time, since it's a fixed rate of new token generation but a larger total pool of tokens each time


[02/13/2022 1:17 AM] Arohbe#0000
EIP-0027 that is (re @Arohbe: Well it‚Äôs actually storing erg in storage boxes to be distributed to miners once the emission schedule ends.)


[02/13/2022 1:18 AM] martyergo#0000
Yeah the ultimate effect being that emissions are a bit slower but they still run out a few years later i think? (re @Arohbe: EIP-0027 that is)


[02/13/2022 1:19 AM] Arohbe#0000
Hang on I had a chart somewhere


[02/13/2022 1:19 AM] martyergo#0000
The idea being that by then, transaction fees should be enough to satisfy the cost of securing the network by incentivizing enough mining


[02/13/2022 1:19 AM] martyergo#0000
But transaction fees are very limited, since there's a hard cap on total block space per block


[02/13/2022 1:19 AM] martyergo#0000
If I'm not mistaken


[02/13/2022 1:22 AM] Arohbe#0000
This could be a little inaccurate as I put it together based on what info is out there but if EIP is passed the initial emission schedule is actually exhausted sooner

But then Re-emission follows this schedule (I beleive)

[02/13/2022 1:24 AM] martyergo#0000
Oh it's 3 per block till 2045? That's pretty good. Does it end then?


[02/13/2022 1:25 AM] Arohbe#0000
Thats how I understood it (assuming there are no other fork proposals between now and then)


[02/13/2022 1:25 AM] martyergo#0000
That gives plenty of time to figure out if a new tail emission is necessary


[02/13/2022 1:32 AM] Arohbe#0000
Yes, if Im right haha.....Ergo Watch shows a similar scenario so I am assuming its close (re @martyergo: That gives plenty of time to figure out if a new tail emission is necessary)

Block size can be increased gradually over time via miner voting. Just as the computational cost limit of a block can. (re @martyergo: But transaction fees are very limited, since there's a hard cap on total block space per block)

[02/13/2022 6:18 PM] martyergo#0000
Yes essentially, but inflation decreases over time since new tokens will be less ratio to overall supply

[02/14/2022 7:42 PM] kushti_ru#0000
4.0.23 has tx size  limit of 96 kb by default for the mempool. So bigger tx can be included by a miner directly only (re @glasgowm: Wdym? As they have a 25k one planned next)

Other than that, each output adds 300 to tx cost, and 25k outputs currently above block limit

She said they have tools to track wallets and funds and she would not disclose more info about that. The other problem no one talks about is that a suspiscion is enough to freeze or close a bank account without any possible legal recourse against the bank. And the fact that this is announced as a permanent measure.
They want cash to disappear and we might well also enter a world where unidentified sources of income for which you can‚Äôt provide proofs of provenance might be just blocked right away by default.

If they can go from law to enforcement in such a short period.   It just shows they are already monitoring things. Probably using private 3rd parties.


[02/18/2022 4:54 PM] Armeanio#0000
Maybe not it's hard to know. But that type of efficiency isn't common in governments.

[02/18/2022 5:00 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
It didn‚Äôt need to get to this stage. The police didn‚Äôt arrest those who broke laws. To me, it‚Äôs that simple. Arrest those who are committing crimes and investigate them - do not enact sweeping measures that invade everyone because of the actions of a small group.


[02/18/2022 5:00 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
Here is a report that already indicates some worrisome info based on the enactment of these extreme powers:

‚ÄòFreedom convoy‚Äô fundraising: No rise in suspicious transaction rep...
The deputy director of Fintrac testified Thursday as the National Security Committee probed violent extremism and those funding it, against a backdrop of protests unfolding across the country against vaccine mandates and health restrictions.

[02/18/2022 5:02 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
The problem is how easily flexible is nowadays the definition of unlawful.. and how quickly one can become a criminal, as soon as one‚Äôs actions are identified as threatening political (and soon to come: financial) stability.


[02/18/2022 5:27 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
Agreed. I am NOT in favor of these sweeping powers that the government has enacted.
I‚Äôm not talking about political associations though. I‚Äôm talking about actual crimes that break laws, including harassment, assault, hate crimes, deliberate blocking of emergency vehicles (like ambulances), and attempted arson with the intent to harm. These are some of the crimes that have been committed at regular frequency unfortunately. Do they represent the majority of protestors? Probably not.


[02/18/2022 5:28 PM] martyergo#0000
I think it would be more sensible to arrest those individuals


[02/18/2022 5:28 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
It‚Äôs a pattern we can also see in crypto unfortunately

[02/18/2022 5:29 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
that was the failure here in Ottawa (re @martyergo: Protect people with policing)


[02/18/2022 5:29 PM] martyergo#0000
It's obviously politically motivated and the protests were just a catalyst


[02/18/2022 5:30 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
But nonetheless what we have seen in Ottawa was trully beautiful and gave a lot of hope everywhere in the world, and their reaction and ban of crypto is good marketing for crypto as a tool to avoid coercition.


[02/18/2022 5:31 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
It‚Äôs just that every camp is building tools, on one side to have more control, on the other to avoid it.


[02/18/2022 5:32 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
But evolution can‚Äôt be without any resistance of the old world, we knew that already.


[02/18/2022 5:32 PM] martyergo#0000
The harder they push the wrong way, the faster they'll drive people to crypto. So in that sense I guess it's a good thing, but I never expected Canada of all places to be the instigator


[02/18/2022 5:33 PM] upwindstrategy#0000

Is it possible to put a load balancer on the mining protocol that could prevent 51% attacks by decreasing mining rewards as a single mining node approaches 40% of the network


[02/18/2022 7:17 PM] martyergo#0000
Similar to how cardano does that to prevent stake pools from getting to large


[02/18/2022 7:19 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
It would have to be done by the mining pools I think. We looked into this with smart pool idea, when a limit is reached create a subpool to take the excess. I don't think the big mining pools are too concerned about it though. (re @martyergo: Is it possible to put a load balancer on the mining protocol that could prevent 51% attacks by decreasing mining rewards as a single mining node approaches 40% of the network)


[02/18/2022 7:24 PM] Arohbe#0000
Correct. Can only be controlled by the pools as they configure their nodes and at times have multiples. There is even a challenge with subpools. Even with a subpool the hosting server is still the same and the pool operator still controls it.  Possibly if the reference client was updated for all nodes but then who‚Äôs to say that pool is using the latest version. (re @Gazza_ERG: It would have to be done by the mining pools I think. We looked into this with smart pool idea, when a limit is reached create a subpool to take the excess. I don't think the big mining pools are too concerned about it though.)


[02/18/2022 7:28 PM] martyergo#0000
So there's not much you can do to prevent 51% attacks or Sybil attacks if someone was determined?


[02/18/2022 7:28 PM] martyergo#0000
And had a lot of resources


[02/18/2022 8:20 PM] Arohbe#0000
afaik. We have some ideas but none are feasible at this point.  However, I think I read somewhere that these attacks on ergo would only limit other pools from finding blocks. Which still sucks but


[02/18/2022 8:20 PM] martyergo#0000
It wouldn't allow double spends?


[02/18/2022 8:24 PM] Arohbe#0000
Not sure.  Let me track down where I saw that.  Possibly was Kushti in a video (re @martyergo: It wouldn't allow double spends?)

In the case of big competitive networks and industrial POW miners, it is being used to lower the position of some clone or to fork when visions split and continue as another blockchain, sometimes industrial miners support few visions and their popularity. In any case dedicated miners quickly eliminate or bypass the rogue player, in the case of Bitcoin I would give it one block to sort out things even with some double-spend which wouldn't cover even the cost of attack. Additionally, with only one gov attack there is a problem. To get such significant computing power in the case of Bitcoin, they would need to capture and control most pools at once but the multinational attack is always a possibility, they still aren`t able to shut down the whole grid and internet what they practice in different countries in the last years. In the case of Ergo and usually new, different POW algos and concepts, industrial miners get more profit just by mining it especially when competition is almost nonexistent including mining software development. Evil forking at this stage of very heavy and significant core updates, low popularity and a number of developers is not likely. More likely is fork because of some mistake :) Pools attack each other also what was visible in Ergo before but in the case of honest mining, it didn`t do any harm, similar to huge solo mining power at the start.

Forwarded from Sofaclese: Hello Ergo fam
https://youtu.be/Zx09-aPiOLI
this interview is great, the guy speaks really well and passionately‚Ä¶but the aesthetic and production values are an absolute abbhoration, Im pretty sure that background gave me an STD? The Sound also awful..the lighting muggy and flat
Please lord can Ergo put aside some budget for a videography team or at least invest in a team camera for this sort of thing and a very simple lighting set up‚Ä¶Im happy to talk through some tips on how to light and film things better with some simple steps 
I know it seems petty and in a utopia it wouldnt matter, but clean visuals do help capture peoples attention and create a sense of value and belief in the professionalism of the project. There are so many more interesting ways an interview like this can be filmed. The guy speaks well and convincingly. I know this may seem petty - and ya welcome to ignore this as unimportant‚Ä¶ but I genuinely thing this is an aspect that doesnt help the projects adoption and/or investment
just my 2 cents

[02/19/2022 9:59 PM] AndyLowe#0000
@martyergo  the problem is the deadlines were ignored, I was getting sent content with no time to ask for people to make changes. I was sent videos as recently as 2 days ago and right now I am still waiting for 1 video so if it's not good quality there is no time to ask them to do it again. The people sending videos are just volunteering their time so we cant tell them what to do 
The brand of 'ergo' is a community of contributors, different projects.. if they send footage that is pro or not it's more of a reflection of their project than of ergo if you ask me. (re @NoahErgo: Thats not a bad idea either)


[02/19/2022 10:00 PM] AndyLowe#0000
A lot of people are too busy to make content so then we can't also demand that they learn to be a pro videographer also. They would probably just not make a video at that point


[02/19/2022 10:00 PM] martyergo#0000
Yeah fair enough. I think Noah is just recommending some guidelines and where bounties are concerned, encouraging community members to use better equipment and meet some specification.


[02/19/2022 10:00 PM] martyergo#0000
Nothing against you, you're doing a fantastic job


[02/19/2022 10:01 PM] martyergo#0000
Yeah I recall you asked us to meet a deadline in January for this. That's actually why I dipped out, I didn't have time to prepare something I felt would be professional enough


[02/19/2022 10:03 PM] AndyLowe#0000
There are no bounties for summit content, people are not paid. They only gain some exposure in exchange for their efforts to make a video. So the incentive is with them to make the quality as high as they want, as it reflects on their project


[02/19/2022 10:04 PM] AndyLowe#0000
If you look at how big the ecosystem is right now, imagine next summit there could be 100 projects on ergo. They can't all expect to be sent camera equipment it's not feasible. And then there is the question of how to use it


[02/19/2022 10:05 PM] martyergo#0000
Definitely not, I think that was just spitballing


[02/19/2022 10:05 PM] AndyLowe#0000
I'm all for increasing quality but I think educating and giving advice is the way, not sending gear


[02/19/2022 10:05 PM] martyergo#0000
I agree


[02/19/2022 10:06 PM] AndyLowe#0000
Frosty (anetaBTC) was quite new to making videos and actually, the sound that you hear on the video was the improved version. I has to go through very word and sync up their backup recording because the original version they sent sounded like it was recorded underwater


[02/19/2022 10:06 PM] martyergo#0000
Framing the picture better is free, using lighting with lamps can make a big difference


[02/19/2022 10:06 PM] AndyLowe#0000
But I gave him advice to improve it next time


[02/19/2022 10:06 PM] martyergo#0000
A big one is mic position and setup

I know.. also we had Matthew contacting people this time round and he was just sort of an unnecessary middleman to slow down communication (re @martyergo: Framing the picture better is free, using lighting with lamps can make a big difference)


[02/19/2022 10:07 PM] AndyLowe#0000
Yes, took 2 hours (re @martyergo: Damn that's time consuming)


[02/19/2022 10:08 PM] AndyLowe#0000
But, on the other hand, people who take the time to make content is good, the video was good overall and we can't expect everyone to be a pro the first time they make some content


[02/19/2022 10:08 PM] AndyLowe#0000
I actually disagree with sofa about the visuals, I think the visuals on frostys video is nice


[02/19/2022 10:08 PM] AndyLowe#0000
Personal taste I guess


[02/19/2022 10:09 PM] martyergo#0000
For the backdrop? It's a bit distracting imo.


[02/19/2022 10:09 PM] martyergo#0000
But better framing would have made a difference, and made the backdrop less distracting


[02/19/2022 10:10 PM] AndyLowe#0000
Ultimately it all comes back to the decentralised community, every project is independent, whatever content they submit reflects on them


[02/19/2022 10:10 PM] AndyLowe#0000
Like if ergopad makes some super pro content it looks good on you


[02/19/2022 10:10 PM] AndyLowe#0000
If you make amateurish content it looks bad


[02/19/2022 10:10 PM] AndyLowe#0000
It's the essence of ergo it's an open community


[02/19/2022 10:10 PM] martyergo#0000
Anyway it's just suggestions. If you send out a short guideline on some ways to improve quality in the future, it might go a long way. Something to consider


[02/19/2022 10:11 PM] AndyLowe#0000
Yeah i agree


[02/19/2022 10:11 PM] martyergo#0000
Agreed, and I'm trying to improve that iteratively. (re @AndyLowe: If you make amateurish content it looks bad)


[02/19/2022 10:11 PM] AndyLowe#0000
Next time also I want to start the process much much sooner


[02/19/2022 10:11 PM] martyergo#0000
It's surprising how fast what seem like long time frames just disappear on you


[02/19/2022 10:12 PM] AndyLowe#0000
Yes. Maybe next summit we can have a quality control element. But it requires at least some time to let people go away and make a new version


[02/19/2022 10:57 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Not sure if gear would help. I recorded my videos with my smartphone for the picture and MacBook internal mic for the sound, zero extra gear and it seems to do the job good enough.
For frosty's video, only thing I would change is zooming in and showing less background. (re @AndyLowe: I'm all for increasing quality but I think educating and giving advice is the way, not sending gear)


[02/19/2022 11:00 PM] martyergo#0000

[02/19/2022 11:00 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
If there was a problem with the original sound, it is just a good practice to record the sound with a second device. By the way, the sound was okay so if it was not good to begin with your editing did wonders


[02/20/2022 7:09 AM] upwindstrategy#0000
The good thing I liked with the editing is that they cut out all the unnecessary time of hesitations in the speech so that it‚Äôs very easy to listen to.

Mining is suppressed in China. 666 pool had to be shut down for a while. getblok should take technical actions to hide the web address via which Chinese miners connect their GPU devices to getblok so that getblok will not become the next target similar to 666. (re @Arohbe: @Rongrong21 can you elaborate on this?)

on how to build on this and actually reach people check out the ambassadors section
https://sideways-stove-8c5.notion.site/Ambassadors-f8e585880b584c02b602abc07294c789
regional ambassadors & meetup organisers can do on-the-ground grassroots marketing. Stickers, events, flyers, etc. 
Then we need ambassadors for each space (FB/Twitter/etc) who know it well - can build up erg with a structured plan. But yeh seems like the DAO is a missing component here. Think I will just see if they can go with a zkt for now to get the ball rolling.

Armeanio: We are still waiting for the toolsets.  
Angie: How long will it take
Armeanio: We are waiting ErgoTeam and ErgoPad also planning but that's still raw
Kushti: We can start something with ZK-Treasury, that's small scale tool and for tech savvy people
Armeanio: I think we are doing good job with Sigmanauts group that's being incubating
Glasgow: I will get people get involved
Angie: I aim to have 2-3 public pieces could be good for public strategy
Kushti: How are we planning to attract people from outside. Marketing machine working towards community, we need some sales pitches to go outside. That's still a problem there. 
Angie: What as sales pitch, crowd marketing?
Kushti: How to sell Ergo in couple sentences. We are targeting cryptocurrency community, maybe average reddit users. What are we doing to get there.
Glasgow: smart money, trustless financial contracts, non-custodial, peer-to-peer, 
Kushti: How to get people from other channels
Angie: Raise ranking in Google in keywords, start targeting advertising in Google AdWords. Either we take and give advertising to digital advertisers. This and the contributor roles and projects
Angie: we can have 2-3 ads and see the ranks and organize SEO. 
Glasgow: we can help other projects by our core dev contributions


[02/23/2022 6:07 PM] martyergo#0000
We are meeting James from "your cardano update" later today to discuss a biweekly ergo news show for YouTube..would be ergopad sponsored but targeting a much more general audience, outside of ergo community perhaps


[02/23/2022 6:07 PM] martyergo#0000
Speaking to kushti's mention of getting outside our bubble with marketing


[02/23/2022 6:07 PM] martyergo#0000
I was thinking guests could be more general, like discuss crypto defi as a whole, crypto technology, things of that nature, yet still bring it back to ergo


[02/23/2022 6:08 PM] martyergo#0000
I think appealing to a more general audience is a great idea since everyone in the community is already sold on ergo


[02/23/2022 10:06 PM] kushti_ru#0000
"We now have a Twitter account for the AH. @kushti please promote if possible )

[02/23/2022 10:59 PM] AndyLowe#0000
What does ergopad sponsored mean? (re @martyergo: We are meeting James from "your cardano update" later today to discuss a biweekly ergo news show for YouTube..would be ergopad sponsored but targeting a much more general audience, outside of ergo community perhaps)


[02/23/2022 11:16 PM] martyergo#0000
funded by ergopad (re @AndyLowe: What does ergopad sponsored mean?)


[02/23/2022 11:17 PM] martyergo#0000
we are open to partnering with the Ergo foundation on sponsoring this project


[02/24/2022 12:08 AM] martyergo#0000
Pretty sure this project will be a go. If anyone has recommendations for interviewees within or outside the ergo ecosystem, please share them. Show topic ideas are also welcomed


[02/24/2022 1:04 AM] NoahErgo#0000
Would be cool to interview the dcspark guys since they were previously heavily involved with Ergo
People from indigo on cardano talking about synthetics on eutxo could be cool i know theres been some interest from them in ergo
Maybe Romain pellerin could be cool hes involved with the utxo alliance (re @martyergo: Pretty sure this project will be a go. If anyone has recommendations for interviewees within or outside the ergo ecosystem, please share them. Show topic ideas are also welcomed)


[02/24/2022 1:07 AM] NoahErgo#0000
Ideally people that are related to ergo in some way but arent specifically only in the ergo community in-group


[02/24/2022 1:51 AM] NoahErgo#0000
I know ray network is also interested in ergo and they have ergo on their roadmap


[02/24/2022 12:08 PM] AndyLowe#0000
@martyergo who will be the host of the show?


[02/24/2022 12:13 PM] kushti_ru#0000
Would be good to discuss, as well as other possibilities (re @martyergo: we are open to partnering with the Ergo foundation on sponsoring this project)


[02/24/2022 12:14 PM] kushti_ru#0000
Can get Romain on some show relatively easily I guess (re @NoahErgo: Would be cool to interview the dcspark guys since they were previously heavily involved with Ergo
People from indigo on cardano talking about synthetics on eutxo could be cool i know theres been some interest from them in ergo
Maybe Romain pellerin could be cool hes involved with the utxo alliance)

We‚Äôre on the same page with Adaverse. Working to rebrand and become a ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù news source for Ergo. We‚Äôll incentivize growing our channel when the rebrand is complete. Going to hire more writers and interviewers (re @martyergo: Pretty sure this project will be a go. If anyone has recommendations for interviewees within or outside the ergo ecosystem, please share them. Show topic ideas are also welcomed)


[02/24/2022 1:11 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
I love what Adaverse is doing. (re @Frostyausty: We‚Äôre on the same page with Adaverse. Working to rebrand and become a ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù news source for Ergo. We‚Äôll incentivize growing our channel when the rebrand is complete. Going to hire more writers and interviewers)


[02/24/2022 1:59 PM] Frostyausty#0000
Thank you...we plan to keep growing it. It's defintely a slow process right now as there is a lot going on. When the rebrand is done we can ask Kyber to come on the show, that should help get attention from ETH community (re @ergomergoadargo: I love what Adaverse is doing.)


[02/24/2022 3:45 PM] AndyLowe#0000
@kushti_ru @DanielTetsuyama @Armeanio - who will be on AMA tomorrow?


[02/24/2022 3:47 PM] AndyLowe#0000

[02/24/2022 3:49 PM] Armeanio#0000

[02/25/2022 3:03 AM] tortodelivery#0000
A Brazilian guy got invited to enter in a telegram group called ergonauts with 5k members I asked him to add me to check more about it. But he can‚Äôt invite me.


[02/25/2022 3:13 AM] AndyLowe#0000

Ergo is not enforcing privacy by default, targeting support for contracts in the first place. Even more, no concrete implementations of cryptographic protocols are in the core protocol. But the protocol has building blocks to build cryptographic protocols as applications.
First applications already implemented:
* ErgoMixer (based on ZeroJoin protocol https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/560.pdf), which allows to restore fungibility of funds via a non-interactive protocol, so without relying on a trusted service.  There is a new mixing protocol just discovered https://www.ergoforum.org/t/yet-another-mixing-protocol/3359 
* Stealth addresses , which allow to preserve privacy of a payment recipient (which can be good for receiving donations anonymously etc) 
* Verifying signatures in contracts (useful for bridges etc)
They can be used in conjunction with DeFi applications, there are examples of that already. (re @lootzlootz: one question... what survellance problem does ergo solve ? (I wanna add you to an interview as an example)

Yet Another Mixing Protocol
Below is an idea for mixing coins motivated from ErgoMixer (aka zerojoin). Hence, some basic idea of ErgoMixer will be useful in understanding the motivation.   Motivation The primary motivation is to develop a better variant of ErgoMixer.    Mix more than 2 boxes: In ErgoMixer, we can mix only two boxes at a time and it will be good to have a s...

Where is that from?
I guess this is because token information is not returned reliably from explorer atm (re @kushti_ru: When you open a wallet, everything is ok and correct. After ~3 min balance is getting crazy and shows millions. After another 3min balance is normal. After another ~1 min balance gets crazy again)

thats definitely not the narrative in europe.. there is no anti-russian sentiment. only the leadership is criticised. its the same in all of history when this kind of thing happens, the general population are never to blame (re @Frostyausty: Yes, it also reminded me how much the West wants us to be divided.

180 million Russians and Ukrainians may lose 50% of their life savings exchange value in a week because of the choices of a small group. Massive economic collateral damage potential. 
That should say everything for building decentralized, open and fair systems.

Yes, in addition to communities struggling from wars, shortage of drinkable water, lack of access to basic humanitarian goods around Middle East, Caucasus, Subsaharian Africa, Donbass, failing currencies in LatAm, turkey etc, we are getting new zones of conflict, high inflation, etc (re @Frostyausty: Not to be dramatic but it feels like Ergo is the one glimmer of hope in the world right now)

Should look at a handshake domain as a backup for this very reason. This point was made in Johnny Wu's summit video, domain names are centralised and can be censored by whoever controls them. A handshake name will provide a backup (re @kushti_ru: Not so good news in regards with domains we have)

We are going to start initiating a shift in marketing. 
The goal is to create more separation between Ergo Platform and Ergo Foundation. As well as empower projects in our ecosystem to increase their marketing and awareness abilities. 
We are going to be bringing @Seedubya on board to be the Marketing Manager of Ergo Platform.
The goal is to drive engagement, community awareness and marketing for projects on top of Ergo. This is the initial step to activating the Sigmanaut group that Glasgow has put together. Hopefully as DAO tooling comes together, we can further evolve this concept. 
Our current Editorial Team and Event Team will be shifting towards the Ergo Foundation (blog/twitter). Idealy the content/planning will still have overlap and can have a nice synergy in terms of parallel support.
More to come as this framework evolves/finds its rhythm.

The medium acc @ergoplatformes I used to post articles will be a good site to have a lot of handy articles together, probably as the community keeps growing more spanish speakers members will gain interest in knowing more.
However, I would love to help with the new method of marketing, engagement and community awareness with the Sigmanauts group, essentially I would like if someone simply assigned tasks to me or gave ideas on what to do (re @Armeanio: We are going to start initiating a shift in marketing.

[03/01/2022 4:21 PM] Daniumy#0000
Also I would like to suggest: 
After ergo's website revamp im guessing there will be some sort of button/link about "Why Ergo?" 
Imho although we have a lot of documentation to read in a journey of researching about Ergo, mostly on ergonaut.space and articles, I will always be a huge fan of having the why ergo button redirecting to a single page that gathers all the info and orders it, maybe the order should be sorted by understanding difficulty, could be something like:
Index
-
Introduction
-
1. Manifesto
- Links that redirects to it
2. Ergo deep dive
- Link to it
3.DeFi
- Links to blog posts/articles about it and regarding Ergo's fair launch
n-2. Autolykos
- Links to documentation, prob technical docs.
n-1. Sigma protocols
...
n. NiPoPoWs
...
I think you get the idea, the hardest part for any project will always be the ability of maintaining users after they finally decide to research about the project itself.
If we ease that job for them by not only having all the info gathered in one single doc that simply redirects to the rest but also ordering it in terms of difficulty, I think they would find it easier to keep reading documentation.


[03/01/2022 4:22 PM] glasgowm#0000

Sorry if this doesn't make sense, it's 3 am üòÇ Looking for to working with everyone! 
Can't wait to devote my time and energy to bringing more engagement through social channels. 
Glasgow and I have done a little work on Sigmanaut Notion regarding a strategy for Twitter. Ill is refining this over the next week.
The aim is to create a more engaging social presence and reach outside of our echo chamber. 
Community sentiment looks to be picking up, @NoahErgo great work with sigmaverse, love it. 
Also looking forward to working closely with @AngieHar and the editorial team! You guys are a wealth of knowledge! 
Fun times ahead!

@Seedubya sometime would love to discuss strategy for expanding outside of ergo community on twitter. I find its a lot of the same people liking and retweeting


[03/01/2022 4:24 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
Anyone want the access codes to ergo_platform's IG I am ready to hand them over. I really did try but it's still struggling 7 months in.


[03/01/2022 4:25 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I think instagram isnt a platform with a big crypto community

but not a huge need to keep on top of it daily. High quality/irregular is fine for now - and yeh pass me the details @ergomergoadargo and I can update it once in a while too (re @NoahErgo: I think instagram isnt a platform with a big crypto community)


[03/01/2022 4:28 PM] Daniumy#0000
Same, as I said would love to get some guidance and some ideas on what to do, I tried to get to communities outside of Ergo but I just couldnt do it (re @NoahErgo: @Seedubya sometime would love to discuss strategy for expanding outside of ergo community on twitter.

[03/01/2022 4:31 PM] Daniumy#0000
I feel like that left side bar could be moved a bit to the left giving more padding to its right?

My first impression was that it was not perfectly easy to focus my vision into the text in the middle

[03/01/2022 4:42 PM] Daniumy#0000
Just a sentiment tho, It was a bit hard for me to focus only on the main text, and simply shift my attention to left side bar if I wanted to switch to other sections, which brain by default will simply not worry about that left side bar unless It wanted to go to other sections


[03/01/2022 4:42 PM] Daniumy#0000
Love it. (re @AndyLowe: Yeah I'm gonna make 2-3 minute explainer videos for each topic and that should be the easiest way to quickly get that info to people who don't want to trawl through loads of articles)


[03/01/2022 4:43 PM] Daniumy#0000
Probably for each section add 
1. short video explaining
2-3-4.. docs maybe a bit more hard to understand and ordered by such difficulty


[03/01/2022 4:44 PM] Daniumy#0000
And keep that format for all the sections, surely some people will simply take a look into the easy understanding videos and then decide whether to take a look at the harder docs or not.

After struggling for a long time to figure out how to make ‚Äúgood‚Äù tweets, here are some things I‚Äôve learned that‚Äôve helped me/aneta a bunch. Feel free to use or not üôÇ 
1. Less is more (people hate reading long tweets. People want to know instantly what the point of a tweet is. I try to do 1 idea per 1 tweet. I try to never put two ideas/concepts in 1 tweet)
2. A nice graphic is key (doesn‚Äôt have to be with all tweets, but with most tweets i think is important, even if using a similar graphic each time)
3. Hashtags bad (it seems counterintuitive, but I try to never use hashtags. Especially general hashtags like #bitcoin #crypto #tech #aneta‚Ä¶I realized it makes my tweets look ugly and add an extra layer of complexity that I realized wasn‚Äôt worthwhile (at least for me). Although I think #Ergo $ERG is good. 
4. Emoji after a sentence are good.  emojis before a sentence bad. I like this emoji haha ü•≥ (re @NoahErgo: Ive similarly been trying to ramp up marketing effort on twitter with the Sigmaverse page so if you guys ever have ideas on how that can be improved please lmk!)

Agreed, esp with less is more and graphics/pictures. 
Not so much on hashtags. On par with mentions ime. To open up to other communities and get erg trending I think they are necessary. 
Two different approaches, neither really "wrong". (re @Frostyausty: After struggling for a long time to figure out how to make ‚Äúgood‚Äù tweets, here are some things I‚Äôve learned that‚Äôve helped me/aneta a bunch. Feel free to use or not üôÇ

@eilemust at this point it would be inefficient to discuss things that May potentially happen I guess. I will transfer domains ASAP, then we need to track news from hetzner, digital ocean and cloudflare and github for sure.

I also have a suggestion for ergo projects looking to attract investors that didn't get into Ergopad but still would love to invest in early seed stage of Ergo projects (also beyond Ergopad projects), there's a lack of go-to place to be informed on when and how to participate. Maybe just a simple page in calendar form would be enough.


[03/04/2022 4:38 PM] eilemust#0000
I can add the website with calendar if anyone want to support this idea.


[03/04/2022 4:38 PM] eilemust#0000
And admin panel to add the content


[03/04/2022 4:38 PM] eilemust#0000
Or maybe better to do it as part of sigmaverse.io


[03/04/2022 4:39 PM] eilemust#0000
@NoahErgo what do you think?


[03/04/2022 4:40 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I guess i feel like at the moment this isnt important. How often is this kind of calendar event happening? Not often


[03/04/2022 4:40 PM] eilemust#0000
Maybe it can be part of the new website


[03/04/2022 4:41 PM] eilemust#0000
For all ergo events


[03/04/2022 4:41 PM] NoahErgo#0000
That might be a better idea


[03/04/2022 4:41 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I like that


[03/04/2022 4:42 PM] NoahErgo#0000

[03/04/2022 5:06 PM] NoahErgo#0000
An added benefit will be cross project promotion as well. If a person goes to the calendar to look for an ergohack date maybe they see tomorrow is last chance for an ido or something and they will get interested when they might not have known about it otherwise

[03/05/2022 12:54 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
I suggested to Paideia to think about integrating a DAO royalty that could be added to the Artist Royalty of NFTs. This way, an artistic collection could pay directly a cause without having the artist to receive the money, pay taxes on it, then give it further. If it's paid directly by the blockchain, the artist can create a subsidiary community, cause, goal to his artwork and make it integreated into the coming Ergo DAO tools. It could be pretty powerful.


[03/05/2022 12:56 PM] Luivatra#0000
I dont think that is a dao tool though, it would be an nft tool, allowing to pay royalty to a specified address other than the minter. This address could then be the dao treasury (re @upwindstrategy: I suggested to Paideia to think about integrating a DAO royalty that could be added to the Artist Royalty of NFTs.

[03/05/2022 12:59 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
That's exactly why I also mentionned it here, as I have the feeling it would need some higher level coordination to make it happen. But my experience with "The Ape Society" on Cardano made this need very clear to me. I think they created a smart contract for the DAO, but having it incorporated at the NFT level would be even more secure probably for the NFT investor.

Claims that Russia is disconnecting from the Internet are inaccurate (for now)

After cyber attacks, the Ministry of Digital wants all gov't website to switch to Russian domestic DNS, stop using foreign hosting, web analytic tools, etc.

Quick ergopad update:
- luivatra is changing vesting contract to provide a transferable NFT instead of locked to one address. This has delayed Paideia contribution dates. 
- website API was basically frozen due to huge growth in daily users. We pushed some caching code which has helped freed up the API significantly
- working on a new news show called Proof of Ergo which will be released early April. It will be biweekly. More updates coming soon
- still trying to get CMC to listen to us.

Yes we paid back in 2019 (re @martyergo: May I ask if you paid for ergo probit listing? They are reaching out to list ergopad)


[03/10/2022 2:34 PM] martyergo#0000
Thanks kushti. We have to decide if we'll use any cex at this stage. Might be worth it


[03/10/2022 3:06 PM] kushti_ru#0000
Will further listings of Ergo tokens be cheaper? (re @martyergo: Thanks kushti. We have to decide if we'll use any cex at this stage. Might be worth it)


[03/10/2022 3:27 PM] martyergo#0000
They are charging 30k for one token


[03/10/2022 3:27 PM] martyergo#0000
50k for two simultaneous listings (10% discount this month)


[03/10/2022 3:28 PM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
@martyergo tell me what exchanges you want to target and I'll negotiate


[03/10/2022 3:28 PM] martyergo#0000
80k for 3 but you get perks. Should be cheaper for 3 tbh.. 20% discount on that tier though


[03/10/2022 3:28 PM] martyergo#0000
Thanks Dan, let me run it by the team and see if we do want to push for cex listings right now (re @DanielTetsuyama: @martyergo tell me what exchanges you want to target and I'll negotiate)

[03/10/2022 4:15 PM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
It could work. Let's have a call and we'll talk about what your goals are with the token. Then we'll figure out where would be the best place to get out listed


[03/10/2022 4:17 PM] upwindstrategy#0000

Ergowatch top 10 doesnt list known cex wallets but maybe new ones that arent known yet


[03/10/2022 4:37 PM] glasgowm#0000
Top 10 is selected so it's exchanges consolidating UTxOs I would guess (re @upwindstrategy: )


[03/10/2022 4:39 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
Probably this, because I don't think someone can buy 1M Erg without having a huge impact on price (re @glasgowm: Top 10 is selected so it's exchanges consolidating UTxOs I would guess)


[03/10/2022 4:42 PM] glasgowm#0000
Yeah exchanges mess up a few of the metrics unfortunately.


[03/10/2022 4:45 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
Saw the Paideia video today, I'm very impressed by the quality of what they have done so far. We need more people to realise the power of the Ergo engine, and this is exactly what will showcase this. It's very promising for Ergo.


[03/10/2022 4:45 PM] kushti_ru#0000

Hi, could someone advice technical challenges for the next hackathon? I mean we need to propose technical tasks for devs in boarders of ETHD conference. It may include requests for bridge, cover defi, or request to bring a specific solution. Looking forward to discuss and find common formulation üôèüèΩ

I think crosschain bridges are a huge must for Ergo. If we could have more developers attacking that it could hopefully help make some extra progress for the current ongoing bridges.

If erg goes up does RSV go up?


[03/16/2022 8:51 PM] martyergo#0000
The problem is the fee is too high


[03/16/2022 8:52 PM] NoahErgo#0000
to get the reserve ratio above 400% again would require nearly 260,000 erg to be spent

[03/16/2022 8:54 PM] NoahErgo#0000
yeah there is no incentive to mint


[03/16/2022 8:55 PM] NoahErgo#0000
it is a real problem that keeps getting ignored imo


[03/16/2022 8:55 PM] martyergo#0000
Maybe if the fee was removed when RSV is needed, on the Rsv side


[03/16/2022 8:55 PM] seedubya#0000
5200 erg fee (2% of 260k)


[03/16/2022 8:56 PM] NoahErgo#0000
you mean like below 400% there is no resv fee?


[03/16/2022 8:56 PM] martyergo#0000
So if someone wants to mint sigusd when it's in demand, have a high fee, but if they want to mint sigrsv right now when there's no demand, make it free


[03/16/2022 8:56 PM] martyergo#0000
Yeah


[03/16/2022 8:56 PM] NoahErgo#0000
seems exploitable maybe


[03/16/2022 8:56 PM] martyergo#0000
If it means the reserve ratio gets back to an appropriate level, why not?


[03/16/2022 8:56 PM] martyergo#0000
As soon as reserve ratio is ok again, turn the fee back on


[03/16/2022 8:57 PM] martyergo#0000
Honestly for ergopad treasury we would have used the system a lot more but it was costing us too much


[03/16/2022 8:57 PM] martyergo#0000
Like for $50k it cost $2k or something crazy


[03/16/2022 8:58 PM] NoahErgo#0000
yes and for small individuals knowing the risk of RSV plays and also the amount of fees involved, nobody wants to touch it


[03/16/2022 8:58 PM] martyergo#0000
As soon as fee is gone on sigrsv we can mint some


[03/16/2022 8:58 PM] NoahErgo#0000
the go to answer is ‚Äúwell in the future there will be more use case for sigusd‚Äù but now we are in a predicament


[03/16/2022 8:59 PM] martyergo#0000
Its good to diversify the treasury


[03/16/2022 9:00 PM] NoahErgo#0000
somebody said it before I think Ile, that sigmausd should not require generosity or altruism to keep the protocol afloat


[03/16/2022 9:02 PM] martyergo#0000
No it should incentivise

There‚Äôs a good summary here:

Dear all,  DJED paper:   TLDR  minimal djed = sigmausd  Extended djed seeks to correct the following shortcomings: Reserve draining attack (read bearwhale), wholesale discount (buying in one tx is cheaper than the same amount with multiple tx, because the price changes in between), Zero equity (at 100% reserve ratio, reservecoin is worthless), r...

[03/16/2022 9:03 PM] anon_br#0000
Not sure where I read that but I saw somewhere this fee was increased after bearwhale


[03/16/2022 9:04 PM] martyergo#0000

[03/16/2022 9:06 PM] glasgowm#0000
I don‚Äôt think it does. Who‚Äôs donating? RR at its lowest is about 250% and the incentives to mint rsv / redeem sigusd work well so I dont think it‚Äôs in danger of loosing the peg - but defo need more utilisation ofc (re @NoahErgo: somebody said it before I think Ile, that sigm...)


[03/16/2022 9:06 PM] martyergo#0000
Who runs sigusd? Should definitely implement some suggestions from that paper!

The bank box runs sigusd


[03/16/2022 9:07 PM] glasgowm#0000
needs more community discussions, SIPs were discussed - not sure how much can be changed with current vote tokens though - maybe just the fee.


[03/16/2022 9:07 PM] martyergo#0000
My mistake, fee is quite low


[03/16/2022 9:07 PM] martyergo#0000
To mint sigrsv right now


[03/16/2022 9:09 PM] martyergo#0000
To mint 10k erg worth of sigrsv costs 242 erg


[03/16/2022 9:09 PM] martyergo#0000
And the same to redeem later


[03/16/2022 9:10 PM] martyergo#0000
To take a risk and help the system you're being charged


[03/16/2022 9:11 PM] martyergo#0000
$1500 in this case


[03/16/2022 9:16 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
The fee goes into RSV anyway, so it is discussable if minting and redeeming RSV should cost a fee.
The vote tokens can change the whole contract


[03/16/2022 9:16 PM] martyergo#0000
are these vote tokens available?


[03/16/2022 9:16 PM] martyergo#0000
is there a dao?


[03/16/2022 9:18 PM] martyergo#0000
there should be no fee for doing things that return the RR back above 400% and vice versa on the other end IMO

How would a vote be proposed?


[03/16/2022 9:31 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Guess this is the right channel. 
The nicknames of the board members were somewhere on the forum or a blog post iirc


[03/16/2022 9:33 PM] martyergo#0000
my theory is this: there should be an immediate financial incentive to mint sigrsv when it is this far below the peg to bring balance to the system. The further from the peg, the more financial incentive. Without financial incentive to keep the system self-adjusting, the system simply won't self-adjust


[03/16/2022 9:33 PM] martyergo#0000
right now, you would have to pay a significant fee to take on the risk of helping the system. Two dis-incentives.


[03/16/2022 9:45 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
I think the fee was mainly to make it harder to profit from price manipulation,  because there‚Äôs time passing between price points. Does djed solve that in another way?


[03/16/2022 9:46 PM] martyergo#0000
the ideal percentage peg is 400 to 700% or something. We're at 350% right now


[03/16/2022 9:47 PM] martyergo#0000
if there was no fee to mint sigrsv right now, wouldn't that encourage some to mint now while it's free?


[03/16/2022 9:47 PM] martyergo#0000
knowing that when it rises above 400% again, the fee will be reinstated


[03/16/2022 9:48 PM] NoahErgo#0000
From the above djes forum post:
Dynamic fees for buying and selling reservecoin and stablecoin. E.g. when reserve ratio is below 600%, then minting fee of stablecoin and redeeming fee of reservecoin go linearly up to 100%. This solves the rigid fees and bank runs problems.


[03/16/2022 9:48 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
That would be a change to the smart contract, which means v3 and current v2 deprecated?


[03/16/2022 9:48 PM] martyergo#0000
this is what djed does, if i'm reading correctly the link from mr stahlfelge


[03/16/2022 9:48 PM] martyergo#0000
a v3 would be good using dapp connectors as well


[03/16/2022 9:49 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
Maybe we should have more datapoints also, maybe using the ergodex bots?


[03/16/2022 9:49 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
I agree we should strive towards the lowest fees possible


[03/16/2022 9:53 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
When will djed be operational? Maybe we wait and see if it works well?


[03/16/2022 10:02 PM] martyergo#0000
fair point


[03/16/2022 10:02 PM] martyergo#0000

[03/16/2022 10:10 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000

if you didn't need to redeem sigrsv to get rewards, just hold it, that might change things. and if it is below peg value, it could be free to mint sigrsv

Perhaps a simple periodic airdrop of new tokens or profits would be sufficient idk. (re @martyergo: i was wondering that. Sort of a staking model ...)


[03/17/2022 4:06 PM] Armeanio#0000
Removing the fees below 400 may be useful.

There is no guarantee for no kyc based on amount or other factors for any exchange, just common rules changing over time

In the past several days, many Chinese people started to stake Ergopads, however, now, they are complaining about the speed of Yoroi wallet and hope that we can solve the issue so that they can stake smoothly. Some guys said Nautilus Wallet works smoothly. However, this wallet has not be security audited. I think that the solution is to improve the Yoroi wallet's user experience and/or audit the security of Nautilus Wallet so that people have good user experience in staking ergopad or playing on ErgoDEX.


[03/19/2022 2:05 AM] martyergo#0000
Nautilus is a much better experience

@kushti_ru some users got these error on Android wallet using your node exactly on this block height:
https://twitter.com/Ergo_Prism/status/1505149551379988486
That means node/info returned another height than it accepted. do you have an explanation for this? did we have an orphan block or some kind of rollback on this height?

I think we should remove the Multisig column on the official wallet page and add a column stating ergopay/web dApp connector support. What do you all think? @glasgowm in special?


[03/20/2022 11:37 AM] dann#0000
Agreed


[03/20/2022 11:39 AM] dann#0000
Also probably adding a small section or clickable buttons which take you to some tutorials regarding how to use and install the wallet/ErgoPay 
The tutorials are already recorded and uploaded, so it should be an easy task

[03/20/2022 4:08 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
about audited/not audited, maybe we simply should add separate sections for that. 
SAFEW supports ErgoPay bridging for now, it can convert dapp connector requests into ErgoPay QR codes so maybe needs half a check in that column as well


[03/20/2022 4:48 PM] glasgowm#0000
can hyperlink the asterixis for more info.

@Frostyausty i am trying to organize a separate hackathon (different from ergohack) that is going to be primarily run by ergopad @martyergo said they might be able to contribute 100k ergopad in prizes, was wondering if you guys might be down to contribute some NETA as well. Hoping to get DeCo involved and maybe have a DeCo student or whitepaper only category so that the playing field is more even. The idea of the hackathon in addition to prizes is that winner would get an opportunity for their project to receive launchpad support through ergopads platform

[03/21/2022 3:36 PM] martyergo#0000
Approved up to 250k


[03/21/2022 3:37 PM] martyergo#0000
Also I think as the organizer, you should take some for yourself. We can also put some extra toward marketing if you have some specific proposals for how to do it. It would be interesting if we could capture an audience outside the existing ergo community


[03/21/2022 3:37 PM] martyergo#0000

@Frostyausty @martyergo 
Please let me know what you think of this rewards structure. Im waiting to hear back thoughts from DeCo as well but we discussed forgoing the final project of the semester and utilizing this hackathon for their final project instead
EDIT: no longer going to use this, going to create smaller rewards so more semesters can have rewards
DeCo Ergoscript Developer Course - Prototype or some kind of meaningful build
100K Ergopad + 200K NETA
Prizes
1st 50k Ergopad + 100K NETA + a slot in the Ergopad roster of projects to be developed via launchpad

3rd 20k Ergopad + 40K NETA
DeCo Layman Course - Whitepaper submission
25k Ergopad 100K NETA
Prizes
1st 12k Ergopad + 50k NETA
2nd 8k Ergopad + 30k NETA

Open to feedback from everyone, trying to find a fair distribution that encourages the most innovation is tough


[03/21/2022 9:22 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Ken said he didnt think the layman course would be a great fit but i didnt want them to be left out. Additionally I think we could announce this after the semester begins as a way to prevent gaming of the course for prizes and also encourage class retention


[03/21/2022 9:27 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Ken is concerned the prize pool feels too big


[03/21/2022 9:28 PM] NoahErgo#0000
He thinks maybe splitting up those lump sums into smaller amounts to provide the option of future hackathons would be better


[03/21/2022 9:30 PM] seedubya#0000
announcing before the semester can provide incentives for devs to jump into some ergoscript. totally get what you're saying re people trying to game it though


[03/21/2022 9:30 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I think the class has prereq classes so that makes it less easy to game


[03/21/2022 9:32 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Kens thinking maybe this semester could be a small trial run of just the dev class and next semester we could do the real deal


[03/21/2022 9:32 PM] seedubya#0000
yeah have to attend 2/3 of the 3 meet ups. something with this big a prize pot is a great incentive to bring in devs, as many as possible


[03/21/2022 9:35 PM] seedubya#0000

Can he restore wallet using ergo mobile app? (re @Rongrong21: He has no authority to speak there.)

Hi, we planned it for May, but can consider making it closer in April


[03/23/2022 10:03 AM] Anastasiia#0000
Hi everyone.
Hopefully, you are doing well.
Unfortunately, I will not be able to join Ergonauts meeting today.
My updates you can find below:
1. Financial report for 2 weeks of March has been completed and shared with EF;
2. Bank account opening. All scope of documents has been completed and sent to Equity Bank for consideration.
3. 22/03 - I had a meeting with Colleagues from Singapore and we discussed Accounting services and Audit.
They have supported our ideas for the accounting services and will be reviewing our General Ledger on monthly/quarterly basis.
@kushti_ru -  please assist with pending transactions for General Ledger in order to complete the file. 
After that we can go for Xero and upload all details there.
Additionally, be informed that topic about Tax Residency came up and Mr. Ching told if one of Executive Directors will be in Singapore, our chances to get Tax Residency in Singapore will be significantly increased.
Thank you


[03/23/2022 10:44 AM] seedubya#0000
Hey all, I also won't make the meeting, it's at 1 am Eastern Aus time. I‚Äôve been a little unwell so catching up on sleep. 
What I've been up to...
 
1. Sigmanauts.
A couple of the Sigmanauts have engaged to write some Twitter Threads on various topics. The recent ‚ÄúWhat is Ergo‚Äù thread did well, currently at ~22k impressions. Hopefully, we can continue to simplify the content for everyday people. The content creation team is helping out which is great. 
 
2. Spaces. 
I Started Twitter Spaces on the ErgoPlatform account. A couple of spontaneous general chats and one with the DeCo team for the scheduled one on Sunday afternoons.  
 
All were well received, apart from the odd buffoon jumping in.  
 
I‚Äôm hosting the GetBlok team this Sunday at 4 pm UTC.  
 
As always, seeking feedback on how to improve etc. 
 
3. Video Content.
I‚Äôve begun to transcribe various topics for video content, beginning with how to set up a node on Linux and Windows. I don‚Äôt have access to a Mac, maybe someone can screen record for me and I can do the voice over. 
 
4. Animations.
Animations are a good tool to grab attention, I‚Äôve been writing down some ideas regarding content for some simple info animations, that could tie in with Sigmanauts Twitter threads.  
 
These can be useful tools to grab attention when making replies to influencers' Tweets. 
 
5. Cross-platform. 
As with animations, planning on ideas for cross-platform content. As the audience is limited when it comes to Crypto, I‚Äôm thinking of some simple infographics with links to articles. 
 
Thanks, this will continue to keep me occupied :)

Hi guys this is the proposal I have put together for a new Hackathon separate from Ergohack.

I worked closely with Keith (not Ken, I had his name wrong before) of DeCo to try and figure out the best way to use the sponsored funds and sustain over multiple DeCo semesters. We decided that keeping the hackathon internal to DeCo pupils only would be a good way to incentivize participation and future enrollment in the course, while also creating a pipeline of new ideas into the Ergopad incubator.

[03/23/2022 3:13 PM] NoahErgo#0000
@martyergo @Frostyausty since your teams would be sponsoring this I am especially interested in your opinions and feedback.
@AngieHar proposed dates would align with the end of semester, Hackathon: Week 7 May 13-15, May 16-20 judging, Announce results May 21
Luivatra indicated that he would be able to judge, @kushti_ru I would love if you could judge as well as I indicated in the proposal.
@AndyLowe in the community involvement I outlined a section about creating a few videos for the students during the hackathon, if the proposal is received well by all here we could chat about that separately

Awesome thank you!


[03/23/2022 6:56 PM] martyergo#0000
In our case, the devs don't help with the whitepapers much


[03/23/2022 6:57 PM] martyergo#0000
The whitepaper is an outline of the concept and a bit of a roadmap as to the steps we'll take to make it real, along with revenue projections. More of a business side of things. The specific development details are usually not fully fleshed out in the whitepapers we create at this time


[03/23/2022 6:57 PM] martyergo#0000
I know that's not specifically how the Bitcoin one was written, or even the ergo ones, but from an ergopad perspective its more of an descriptive pitch deck in a sense


[03/23/2022 6:58 PM] martyergo#0000
Would the whitepapers you'll request be more about the ergoscript and technical details?


[03/23/2022 6:58 PM] martyergo#0000
"Project should attempt to be as fully realized as possible from a nuts and bolts
perspective rather than a marketable front end dev perspective."


[03/23/2022 6:58 PM] martyergo#0000
This makes sense


[03/23/2022 7:00 PM] martyergo#0000
This looks like it will bring a ton of interest to the Deco courses

I dont think so, given that its coming out of the layman course. I think the goal is to get the laymen participating still so they feel motivated to return to the dev course and bring their idea to life


[03/23/2022 7:02 PM] NoahErgo#0000
layman course will present ‚Äúwhitepapers‚Äù with their project idea and dev course will be building actual projects


[03/23/2022 7:03 PM] NoahErgo#0000
creating rewards structure for both courses encourages retention and return of the layman to the advanced dev course the following semester


[03/23/2022 7:21 PM] guybrandon#0000
Hey guys. Long time no see :) Hope it's all going well here.
Just a thought: ETC is getting some love and the narrative is that miners are leaving ETH ahead of PoS. 
Maybe there's an opportunity to pitch Ergo as another home for miners?

- Let's do a community chat on EIP27 another on about the state of DeFi, it seems both are quite good especially DeFi chat. We need to continue community chat and text AMA in addition to video. 
- I also can make some videos if there are any ideas. I 'm going to have one video a week or so, except next week I'm in Dubai it seems.
- Devs chat going well
- Maybe I can also get other developers to be more communicative for organizing chat AMAs
- For the hackathon I'm supporting if help is needed. I'm in chat with Kim, we are discussing EF support for DeCo, there are talks about possible support from DarkFund0 for Guapswap. We are working for incorporating Guapswap maybe some help would also be needed for ErgoLend. I think the biggest issue to support projects after hackathon
Angie: Could you say please about prize pool for next hack
Kushti: Prize pool could stay the same, it‚Äôs quite good I believe. The biggest problem is to support projects after ErgoHack. For prize pool there is no problem there
Foeniculum:
- Working on Ergnomes series 3 for representing all the new projects on Ergo, this has several benefits, 
- They will buy a representation of a project on Ergo and I think it will increase the bond not only with NFT and also with the project. This may help to reach different people who invested in different projects to check other project
- I joined the marketing team of NightOwl Casino to represent all characters which they mentioned in their site. release possibly in May
- I received a message from a Cardano project interested in Ergo 
- Skyharbor on average 250 tx a day, lots of people using it. Demand for NFTs still pretty high despite prica action of ERG
Ollie:
- 2 months of study left so need to focus on that
- Rescheduled Autolykos episode with Alex, going with my work
Austin: 
- Just got the zoom with HackHarvard, they will also make in Oct-Nov with sponsorship they'll give all th <clipped message>

CW:
1. Sigmanauts.
A couple of the Sigmanauts have engaged to write some Twitter Threads on various topics. The recent ‚ÄúWhat is Ergo‚Äù thread did well, currently at ~22k impressions. Hopefully, we can continue to simplify the content for everyday people. The content creation team is helping out which is great. 
 
2. Spaces. 
I Started Twitter Spaces on the ErgoPlatform account. A couple of spontaneous general chats and one with the DeCo team for the scheduled one on Sunday afternoons.  
 
All were well received, apart from the odd buffoon jumping in.  
 
I‚Äôm hosting the GetBlok team this Sunday at 4 pm UTC.  
 
As always, seeking feedback on how to improve etc. 
 
3. Video Content.
I‚Äôve begun to transcribe various topics for video content, beginning with how to set up a node on Linux and Windows. I don‚Äôt have access to a Mac, maybe someone can screen record for me and I can do the voice over. 
 
4. Animations.
Animations are a good tool to grab attention, I‚Äôve been writing down some ideas regarding content for some simple info animations, that could tie in with Sigmanauts Twitter threads.  
 
These can be useful tools to grab attention when making replies to influencers' Tweets. 
 
5. Cross-platform. 
As with animations, planning on ideas for cross-platform content. As the audience is limited when it comes to Crypto, I‚Äôm thinking of some simple infographics with links to articles. 
Anastasiia:
1. Financial report for 2 weeks of March has been completed and shared with EF;
2. Bank account opening. All scope of documents has been completed and sent to Equity Bank for consideration.
3. 22/03 - I had a meeting with Colleagues from Singapore and we discussed Accounting services and Audit.
They have supported our ideas for the accounting services and will be reviewing our General Ledger on monthly/quarterly basis.
kushti -  please assist with pending transactions for General Ledger in order t <clipped message>

Supporting projects after the hackathon is what my goal is with the deco hackathon, to create a pipeline into ergopad

Awesome!


[03/23/2022 9:58 PM] NoahErgo#0000
If everyone is on board Ill confirm with Keith so they can prepare for the semester which starts at the end of the month. Would like to hold off on any announcements until then


[03/23/2022 10:00 PM] martyergo#0000
I'm ok with it


[03/23/2022 10:01 PM] martyergo#0000
Did you take some of the tokens for yourself as the organizer of all this? It will be a lot of work. And some for marketing materials


[03/23/2022 10:05 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I left some cushion (20k ergopad) in the funds provided as an option for paying anybody who might be involved. For the following semesters after the prototype run we can always adjust winnings amounts too


[03/23/2022 10:16 PM] martyergo#0000
This is going on for how many months?


[03/23/2022 10:20 PM] NoahErgo#0000
The deco semester lasts 8 weeks but the actual hackathon is just a weekend. Students will be forming ideas over the course of the semester. The hackathon basically replaces the original plan for the final presentation that Keith had planned


[03/23/2022 10:21 PM] NoahErgo#0000
it slots in pretty nicely into the existing DeCo semester so honestly should be manageable


[03/23/2022 10:22 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Keith and Cheese Enthusiast are the two people teaching the course so they will be judges as well


[03/23/2022 10:23 PM] NoahErgo#0000
and the idea is that every semester for the following four semesters the hackathon will take place again for the next cohort of students as their final projects


[03/23/2022 10:24 PM] seedubya#0000

[03/23/2022 10:25 PM] martyergo#0000

We're good to go whenever you'd like, and we can make social posts to share it around


[03/23/2022 10:26 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Nice, yeah I want to wait until the semester begins as a surprise for the students involved and then we can push marketing on socials


[03/23/2022 10:27 PM] martyergo#0000

Hi all, I am getting a few reports of people not able to check transactions for their address in the explorer. For example here, they have a balance of 8 ERG but no transactions, 3 people have contacted me with the same problem. If you search the wallet address, it won't show, you need to access it by following a tx ID.

@MrStahlfelge Can the user restore his  wallet only using his mnemonic words?


[03/28/2022 5:32 AM] Rongrong21#0000
A Chinese Yoroi wallet user failed to get back his tokens using his wallet's mnemonic words on Ergo Mobile Wallet, Nautilus Wallet, Yoroi Wallet?


[03/28/2022 5:35 AM] Rongrong21#0000
Alternatively, @Gazza_ERG the current user may encounter the same issue that the previous user Ella encountered. The problem is that he has only one wallet? That means his ergopad tokens in his sole wallet may be transferred to another wallet? But which wallet?


[03/28/2022 7:17 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Another address, he need to go to wallet config -> addresses and derive more


[03/28/2022 9:28 AM] Rongrong21#0000
@Gazza_ERG The current user probably encounters the same issue as the one encountered by Ela. The sole difference is that the user didn't create other wallets on the same computer. The wallet is the sole one where he stored his tokens. How can he get back his tokens. He repeatedly restored his wallet using his mnemonic words. However, he still cannot get back his wallet address where his tokens are stored. These lost tokens can be viewed on explorer.

Some people used Nautilus wallet to import tokens to mobile wallet, the balance in Nautilus is displayed normally, but the balance in Ergo mobile wallet is zero, the wallet address is the same.

I'm not sure that what is the root cause that results in he cannot get back his tokens. His mnemonic words are correct. He restored the wallet. However, the wallet address where his tokens are stored isn't in his restored wallet. Yoroi, Nautilus and  Ergo Mobile Wallets have been used for restoration. Still, he cannot see his address where his tokens are.


[03/28/2022 10:05 AM] Rongrong21#0000
Is there a function that can help him get the verification code for this wallet via his wallet address that holds his tokens? He can only check and see the tokens in that address on explorer  instead of in his restored wallet.

"Still, he cannot see his address where his tokens are." 
as @MrStahlfelge said he must derive more addresses until he finds all the used addresses

this functionallity can be added to the wallet that when restoring a wallet, it derive all previously used addresses automatically. Pretty common in wallets

Yes it looks like it is needed. Stayed away from it for now because it depends on being online on wallet creation and, when users don't understand what is happening, they will have a bad time as soon as their other wallets creates the next address. So it was better if automatic address generation would be an opt in.

Things are not so easy. Careful investigation is needed, there are two possibilities I guess, whether we have subtle difference in verification context between real one used during verification and modelled one, but I doubt ErgoPad contract can exploit that even if difference exists, or there is some bug in ErgoTree interpreter, or maybe dirty state not cleaned properly between txs

Currently reworking the DeCo Hack proposal a bit, they are merging all students into the same class so the laymen will work alongside the more advanced devs as a way for them to learn.
I am also thinking that roughly 1/5 of the funds you guys have offered go to the DeCo treasury as a way for the program to continue to hire teachers, etc. and budget for its needs. Any funds not used to maintain the program will go toward future hackathons.
Trying to make the funds sustain the program and the partnership, but want to make sure that proposal feels reasonable to you both

I think having them biweekly not only would cause more interest simply by being more uncommon, but also you guys will have more interesting news to "announce", which will also increase the interest in the AMA

The AMA is not about hype. It's about bringing a constant stream of information to the community and maintaining transparency about what's happening with the project.

I agree, AMAs are about reassuring investors that the project is active. The weekly AMAs are already packed with a lot of interesting information, and sometimes some information is good to know without delay. It‚Äôs also the cheapest form of marketing.

If they're losing interest in getting info, that is not a problem with AMA constancy. That would be more of a format or content issue


[04/01/2022 1:09 PM] dann#0000
I think that 1k views are probably always coming from the same people, I do not imagine the average community member with around a 30% interest in hearing/reading about some news willing to watch the AMA and see if his investment is becoming fruitful, because they are a common thing.
It is subjective opinion.
But still, there are a lot of people that are active in the community but do not watch the AMAs, Rerolabs comes to my mind, he is always around, and he is always looking for juicy news in any project, but he just doesnt care about AMAs anymore

[04/01/2022 1:12 PM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
Again, it's not about hype, it's about transparency. AMAs are not really meant for juicy announcements. It's more of a progress report to the community.
Also, if that group in particular doesn't find the AMAs useful, we need to ask them what they would find useful in a regular update.
On top of that, even if it's the same people watching the AMA, then those people are getting value out of them. A thousand people is no joke. It's an audience


[04/01/2022 1:12 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
(Sorry for barging in and changing the subject, if you weren't finished).


[04/01/2022 1:12 PM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
And as we increase in numbers, the viewership will increase

I think something needs to change, that is why I proposed biweekly AMAs, I myself have lost a bit of interest sometimes I simply do not watch them


[04/01/2022 1:16 PM] dann#0000
I get your point of transparency and not hype, but well there you have my opinion if it s any useful


[04/01/2022 1:17 PM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
And I really appreciate your input. That's why I wanted to take the time to engage with you and give you my thoughts on the matter


[04/01/2022 1:19 PM] Armeanio#0000
I'll do either way


[04/01/2022 1:20 PM] dann#0000
Maybe I dont see 1k views a really big audience, but that s not a precise opinion at all, I dont have a criteria to know if It s big audience or not.
I remember that one AMA that was done via reddit last year, that one was a really interesting AMA, but again because I am thinking more about the community hype rather than a weekly transparency, I think that transparency without people interested in it is not worth it, but then again it derivates from the fact that I think the 1k viewers is not enough interest


[04/01/2022 1:21 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
An AMA that starts with the most important news condensed in a few minutes and is followed by questions allows to achieve a sweet spot of being short for those that don‚Äôt have the time to listen to the full AMA and more informative for people that want to soak in as much information as possible about what‚Äôs going on in the ecosystem and sometimes the questions are as interesting as the answers.


[04/01/2022 1:22 PM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
That's exactly it. A constant thousand views is definitely a captive audience.


[04/01/2022 1:23 PM] glasgowm#0000
Think it‚Äôd be better mixed up between platforms. 1 week on YT, one on reddit, one ergopulse, one somewhere else. I think 90% of those views are after the recording too so no need to do it live


[04/01/2022 1:25 PM] dann#0000
> *(re @upwindstrategy)*: An AMA that starts with the most important new... 
I think that "most important news" sounds very interesting for everybody, but if you tune in every time and see that those "important news" are always the already known word *soon* people will lose its interest in important news


[04/01/2022 1:25 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
Why not push one content on all platforms at the same time, I think Charles did that at some point, but he came back to Youtube only I think..


[04/01/2022 1:26 PM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
It's still important to a live event for the same reason. Transparency. We're working for the community and a live stream gives the community an opportunity for instant access


[04/01/2022 1:26 PM] dann#0000
But things take time, obviously, the "soon" is inevitable, that is why my idea was to make them biweekly, because then the soon "disappointment" for the average user would be 2 times less common


[04/01/2022 1:26 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
> *(re @Daniumy)*: I think that "most important news" sounds very... 
The updates from Charles in crypto winter were exactly that for a long time, but today the Cardano community is the strongest because it was built during that time.


[04/01/2022 1:26 PM] glasgowm#0000

They are - but lots of people (myself included) dont watch video. I imagine the summaries get more views


[04/01/2022 1:28 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
I see that there‚Äôs a lot more than just exchange coming soon in the development updates, and it‚Äôs gonna just get more and more difficult to follow all development as it will continue to accelerate.


[04/01/2022 1:28 PM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
The symptom you're describing is just an effect of an evolving community. A consistent, frequent and constant content stream like that checks off a lot of boxes for engagement and eventually fills the volume you envision for it.


[04/01/2022 1:28 PM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
Again, this is coming from my personal experience building Cardano. My technical updates were completely neglected, until they weren't.


[04/01/2022 1:28 PM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
I did those every week like clockwork


[04/01/2022 1:29 PM] dann#0000
> *(re @ergomergoadargo)*: I came in here to get your ideas on something-... 
Probably some cardano known twitter people quoting some sentences from the ergo pulse, like, imagine charles eventually saying:
"Yh I dont see why Ergo and Cardano could fit well together"
Then some known guys like the ADA Whale *could* quote it on twitter


[04/01/2022 1:29 PM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
What it also does is create a precise paper trail for our progress


[04/01/2022 1:30 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
> *(re @DanielTetsuyama)*: Again, this is coming from my personal experie... 
It does seem to me that it's something that builds community a lot. It's bound to seem/feel underwhelming until the tipping point is reached, but that doesn't mean momentum isn't building.


[04/01/2022 1:31 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
And the AMAs themselves have offspring like quotes, clips, memes even sometimes that spread throughout the community.


[04/01/2022 1:32 PM] dann#0000
Havent got much else to say! That is my input, just describing as it affects me, I am aware of every little update that is coming soon, but I ve lost interest in keeping a detailed track of it, because I expect this week nothing will be finished, neither next week, neither in 2 weeks
So again, that why I thought maybe having them biweekly would make me think, "Hmmm it could be finished within the next 2 weeks, I will be attention"


[04/01/2022 1:35 PM] dann#0000
But yh, there s not much to say, they are 2 opposite POV, one focusing more on the constant stream of info sacrificing a bit of interest and sudden juicy news, and the other one is more about keeping the hype because some big news could suddenly be dropped, but sacrificing the weekly and super constant updates


[04/01/2022 1:38 PM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
Like I said, juicy news are not meant for AMAs. Those should be handled in a different way. And it's all about community building. Some people fade in and out of the regular content. That's natural. Interests change. But it's slow until it isn't. And it gets like that pretty quickly. Again, going by personal experience.


[04/01/2022 1:39 PM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
Hopefully, as the community grows, you will find the weekly AMAs more appealing to you


[04/01/2022 1:39 PM] dann#0000
Will let you know my opinion again in the future if needed!


[04/01/2022 2:05 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
Where would Ergo be on that graph? just to be sure I don't say anything not 100% verified?

Perfect! Thanks!

We should remove Yoroi from the wallets on Ergoplatform website, at this point it's creating such a bad experience for all new users that it's totally counterproductive. We might have some people leaving the project for good after seeing how it "works".


[04/01/2022 8:08 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
We could replace it with Nautilus wallet for example

It‚Äôs so difficult for newbies to join, if they see a wallet that does not load, they don‚Äôt know why. Nautilus loads fast and gives a good impression. Or otherwise at least remove yoroi because it‚Äôs really too bad for user experience.


[04/01/2022 8:45 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
100% agree on removing Yoroi


[04/01/2022 8:47 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
I‚Äôve been spending some time educating some smart people to buy NFTs on Cardano and it made me realise how many things one must know. So I got more aware of the importance of making things easy to use.


[04/01/2022 8:49 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
I needed 2 hours to explain everything about how to buy NFTs on Cardano üòÖ avoid yoroi was one of the advice i had to give


[04/01/2022 9:23 PM] glasgowm#0000

Need some input here on what columns we have. Going to link to sigmaverse for all wallets - and display popular ones here. (and drop Yoroi/viawallet)

We‚Äôre kinda limited by space - so can‚Äôt have 10 columns. I reckon these work well but could swap out Native Assets for cold storage?

[04/05/2022 1:53 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
Would need to add the Ledger column :)


[04/05/2022 1:53 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
More than native assets


[04/05/2022 2:09 PM] dann#0000
Maybe remove native assets and add cold storage instead, adding Ledger column, and since they all allow native assets, a very small text could be added somewhere if a wallet doesnt allow native assets warning about it


[04/05/2022 2:10 PM] dann#0000
Or like a small red asterisk/star after the name, and below the columns u type something like "* : doesnt allow native assets"


[04/05/2022 2:14 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Every wallet on the list should support tokens anyway so no need to have the column


[04/05/2022 2:15 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Type column could be omitted by grouping the entries by platform.


[04/05/2022 2:15 PM] glasgowm#0000

agree


[04/05/2022 2:16 PM] glasgowm#0000
What about dApp connector/ErgoPay? Hopefully they‚Äôll all support both in future and we could free that other column up (ie for Mixer, or dApp stack in minotaur?)


[04/05/2022 2:20 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Dapp connector can't be supported by non web wallets


[04/05/2022 2:21 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
That's why its full name is web dApp connector


[04/05/2022 2:21 PM] glasgowm#0000
I meant with the signing capability (ie safew) but yeh not sure how to represent it.


[04/05/2022 2:22 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Btw minotaur said to support ergopay


[04/05/2022 2:22 PM] glasgowm#0000
nice, will add an in-progress icon


[04/05/2022 2:24 PM] glasgowm#0000
could maybe change the design later on and allow more columns (and angle the text)

Ergonauts Biweekly 06 Apr 2022
Kushti:
- Probably the biggest achievement on my side, doing a podcast with Charles and Dan.
- Maybe I can do another podcast made by IOHK folks called Impact Podcast.
- It seems an exchange integration is to be finished soon, maybe we consider marketing campaign for it.
- For ErgoHack I'm not in touch with what's going on at the moment. Will jump on that after getting in touch with Angie.
- In regards with developers' chat going well, things are going quite well tech side.
- Missed most of AMAs recently, probably I'll do next one
- ErgoLend is going for public beta testing, maybe we can consider promotion.
- Guys from Ezil, a mining pool combining Ethereum and Ziliqa, they are integrating more cryptocurrencies, they are interested in integrating Ergo.
Glasgow:
- Past Sunday we had Twitter spaces with CW. It's recorded
- I'm focused on websites mostly, reworking with Marcelo.
- Updating notion, gave access to Armeanio and Kushti.
Armeanio:
- Working out for the banking, stuck in perpetual review process.
- I have a video coming up about Marty's project.
-Talking to Charles about setting CFunds.
-Ledger team is back at their offices this week. They‚Äôre finalizing integration.
- BPSAA is interested in doing an ErgoHack that's focused on interoperability. That could be our future ErgoHack focus.
- Setting up couple of more interviews, I'll update when it's landed.
Anastasia:

[04/06/2022 5:59 PM] AndyLowe#0000
Guys sorry I keep missing these ergonaut calls.. life is sometimes busy at those times. 
My update:
Obviously the Charles video was a big hit, the most popular video since I started managing the channel. 
In 48 hours we have 6000 views, over 600 likes and over 100 comments. Also gained almost 100 new subscribers as a result of the video. 
The channel is rapidly approaching 5000 subscribers, which will be a nice milestone as when I took over it was around 2.2k I think so more than doubled so far. Next stop 10k
Working on an ecosystem promo week event with Angie. 
Also I'm ready for any ergohack videos whenever they come. 
Next ergo pulse is lined up and ready, will record it in a couple of weeks.


[04/06/2022 6:03 PM] NoahErgo#0000

Hosting the SkyHarbor team this week.
2. Working with a couple of people to bring weekly YouTube streaming content. Info soon when we have more defined detail.
3. We've seen a nice little uptick in followers from the Ergo Pulse. Congrats to all involved, it was a great hit.
4. Reviewing the new website for attention to details. Correct information, links etc.
5. Regarding my studio. It's almost finished. A camera will arrive today, new PC for editing/stream processing will arrive either Friday or Monday.

Hi guys, I think we should continue to spend some time on getting in touch with the mining pools on Ethereum mining pool list to attract more GPU miners to mine ERGs so that the miners can know where their GPU devices will go when Ethereum switches to PoS.

Is there any way to accelerate this? Feels like erg bridge is just an after thought at this point


[04/07/2022 4:06 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Forwarded from unknown: Hi, yes, the bridge is still in the works, however what SuSy is primarily focused on right now is building and supporting infrastructure for GTON ecosystem, and there's lots of progress in this regard.
We've already established several decentralized oracle networks with datafeeds for Pathway and are doing R&D about bridging and layer 2 solutions, in accordance with GTON's plans of becoming a sovereign blockchain.

[04/07/2022 8:21 PM] seedubya#0000
agreed, having dedicated people or 'specialist' who can dedicate their time to build reputation and relations across different sectors is extremely beneficial. Give the parties/sectors a point of contact also.


[04/07/2022 8:25 PM] seedubya#0000

@Tefcek21 and I are discussing paying for an article on CoinTelegraph. We are thinking maybe it makes sense to do a general Ergo article, and mention Ergopad and more specifically Paideia. Would there be any interest to partner on paid promotions like this from EF?


[04/07/2022 10:45 PM] Tefcek21#0000
Hey guys excited to be here. Recently I had a call with the marketing staff of CoinTelegraph about some advertising and press release for Ergopad. Once we want to share some articles or do some advertising for Ergopad we've to add a brief summary  about Ergo and the Ecosystem. Therefore we had the Idea to wrap all this stuff up and make an explanation post about Ergo and the Ecosystem including Ergopad and Paideia. Cointelegraph is one of the most popular Cryptocurrency related Blog / Platform, could be a good marketing for all of us.

[04/09/2022 10:16 PM] BridgeBot#9505
mhs_sam yes, it was shit. We do not have any persian group right now. I'm still looking for a good moderator to begin with, but no success yet. btw, there is a persian cardano group which I'm pretty active there.


[04/09/2022 10:19 PM] mhs_sam#0000
I also recommend not working with persian tg moderators for your projects. I think I said it personally to sigmavalley and a few other projects. I let you know if I found a suitable person to handle the group.


[04/09/2022 10:38 PM] BridgeBot#9505
Gazza_ERG We have had similar issues with the Persian groups, they make them then demand money to maintain and if you don't they attack with huge bot members spamming

I grilled him about this on twitter and got a kinda indirect answer


[04/11/2022 1:44 AM] NoahErgo#0000
This project was created to perpetuate a store of value over time.
We want to give the opportunity to all those who missed the chance to get into Bitcoin in 2009.

We know this white paper is special, we are just trying to convey our emotions through these words, time will prove that we are sincere. We are loyal Ergo hodlers. 

We've been holding it for over a year and we're also involved in mining Ergo.

We are really like the atmosphere of computer code and coding, I understand that it can seem strange.

ErgOne's goal is to have its own space in the Sigmaverse
(area or building) to allow users to come and exchange their tokens for ours, to buy our future NFTs or to trade them. 

We want to become a strong store of value, create several liquidity pools

In the end, ErgOne should be completely diluted between the different players of the ERGO ecosystem

We are not against offering percentages
ErgOne will be introduced in the Faucet very soon
Users will set the trend

We thank you for your interest in our project and we are open to any suggestions for improvement

 Git itself is highly decentralized, everyone of us has the whole history and source code on our device. What will get lost when GitHub is gone for whatever reason is issues, PR discussions, stats and such stuff


[04/15/2022 5:09 PM] martyergo#0000
Difficult to make a web3 version of that. Requires fast database access for the web2 interface


[04/15/2022 6:41 PM] Eva Qing#0000
I think it is urgent to establish a fully decentralized github-like platform for developers that will never disappear. that is, the newly built platform will save the open-source codes for hundreds of years, so that next next next next generations are able to maintain the ergo blockchain and build dapps on it. you know ergo is designed to survive for hundreds of years. if github disappears years later, where the next next next generation developers can find the full open-source code written for ergo blockchain and dapps on its or other codes written for other blockchains? if there are no places for next next next generations to get data for study and innovation based on these data, how ergo survives for hundreds of years, especially one hundred years later, when few of us can still contribute to the building of the ergo ecosystem.

 I'm wondering if Halo2 is vulnerable to that vectors


[04/19/2022 1:10 PM] kushti#0000
FS is about going from some scheme to its non-interactive variant, and problems are implementation wide here. Halo2 may have other issues, especially during instantiations using concrete curves.


[04/19/2022 1:10 PM] kushti#0000
Halo is very new thing still


[04/19/2022 1:11 PM] oskin#0000

 Guys sorry I missed it again, today I was working on a video for this guy called Dan Friedman and his commercial project. 

It's been a bit quiet for me lately since no Dev updates and I missed the last AMA, but I am ready for the upcoming ergohack fest, and then ecosystem promo week. I have been receiving messages from various people who are making content.

I have agreed with CW to help support his channel and provide technical assistance, with whatever he needs to get things going. So I will probably become busy again soon


[04/20/2022 5:09 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Which brings me to the question: why are there no dev updates by armeanio anymore? I miss them


[04/20/2022 5:15 PM] Armeanio#0000
> Armeanio re @MrStahlfelge: Which brings me to the question: why are there... 
 
 Will be getting back to that with CW


[04/20/2022 5:15 PM] Armeanio#0000
Hoping to bring other on maybe as well make it more interactive.


[04/20/2022 5:16 PM] Armeanio#0000

[04/20/2022 5:21 PM] Armeanio#0000
> Armeanio re @NoahErgo: Sounds fun 
 
 I think if we can pull in community projects, devs, ef members etc it would be a better force multiplier for marketing etc. 

I will make special videos just around core updates when needed.


[04/20/2022 5:22 PM] Armeanio#0000
I guess we should about eip27 @kushti_ru. When it is ready.


[04/20/2022 6:30 PM] AndyLowe#0000
maybe we can also reach out to channels that are committed to covering ergo like for example Ergo Prism, and some projects could independently organise with prism to go on his channel once per month or whatever, and do a project update. these are opportunities for mutual gain from the perspective of the projects and the channels.. so i dont know why they dont already do it


[04/20/2022 6:30 PM] AndyLowe#0000
Having CWs channel is going to be a help but we should try to achieve more of a mesh of channels, to reach the widest audience


[04/20/2022 7:45 PM] CW#0000
Sorry all, once again, slept through my reminder. I need to be more vigilant!

Update from me, 
Helping Glasgow with the website, most of the issues identified he had them fixed up quick smart. Thanks mate

Usual twitter stuff, blew up the subreddit with a thread on NIPoPoWs. Glasgow has amended the bot to only post tweets from EP with the hashtag #ergonauts now.

Working with ergolend and their team on the ground in Africa to get to know the different personalities and how its being used/planning to be used. Will host them on Spaces once everyone is comfortable.

As mentioned by others, my YT channel is good to go, finally! 

 @AndyLowe has agreed to help on the production side. 

Worked with @NoahErgo yesterday to fix up my audio as my hearing is a slightly impaired by industrial deafness.

Working with @Arohbe to iron out details to host a weekly mining stream.

@Armeanio and I are planning a fortnightly vid, more of a laid bad chat about the happenings is ergo, the community and overall industry. Reached out to sigmanauts for help with naming. I should have talking points to you today my time

I've spoken to numerous community members such as ergo_prism and quokka (and others), they're happy to to streams/vids together which is exciting.

I've been making some overlays and what not. If someone can help out with that it would be great also. 

Overall I've been extremely busy learning and getting this all together so now hopefully the fun begins

Cheers all.

yeah sounds good to me, could do a tweet thread/article about open source


[04/21/2022 8:29 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
especially since robovm is an example that open source can't die. microsoft bought the company in 2016 and closed them in 2017 because a cross-platform Java toolkit was unwanted competition for Xamarin. it is still here and vivid because it was open-source before Microsoft bought it.

Forwarded from ErgoBridgeBot: <FlyingPig> Hi. Any chance to remove the Yoroi link from the Ergo website?
As you may know the Aneta folks are doing an NFT sales and whitelisting people with 1k+ NETA in their wallets.
There are a LOT of people that will come on to the ergo platform from cardano. These people are asking for wallet names and many are using Yoroi because that's the wallet on the ergo platform.

Hey ergonauts,

Have you ever thought about brand adjustment and brand strategy?
It is very important for the ‚Äúmass adoption‚Äù strategy execution.
I mean to update design, identity, website structure, and text not only base on your‚Äôs or the designer‚Äôs personal opinions but relating to data, market research, and user interviews?
We in ErgoDEX have contacts with guys (branding studio) who are very good at brand strategy. They also provide redesign and other services. But the main thing that they provide is deep market research.
I see that we both (Ergo and ErgoDEX) have issues with brand identity, identity language, positioning, and communication language. We hired a senior brand manager from that design studio to improve this situation regarding ErgoDEX but this process will consume several months because we have only one person who is focusing on brand strategy. To speed up the process you can hire the whole studio.
EF board, if you are interested in such services please let me know. The pricing will be smth like $80-120k depending on how deep they will research the market and users.

*PS: not an ad, just a suggestion.

 Do they have experience with crypto / case studies? 

The rebranding efforts that have been underway the past ~6mo are backed by deep market research. But doubt the EF would go for such a proposal until the market is in a healthier position.

[05/03/2022 5:42 PM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
Yeah, the issue isn't about finding a band strategy firm. I have connections with several various firms across the board. It's a matter of return on investment for the CF


[05/03/2022 5:44 PM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
Or as Mark was saying - timing.


[05/03/2022 6:12 PM] kushti#0000
I think for a cryptocurrency corporate gimmicks like "brand adjustment and brand strategy" does not make sense basically. What is needed is that to formulate and spread first principles and vision (Ergo Manifesto etc) , also, allow for free improvisations around that (so to propose alternative visions etc) to have broad and diverse story in the long term. That's how Bitcoin won over "blockchain projects" despite failing to deliver most of ecosystem building tools promised by its core devs.


[05/03/2022 6:20 PM] Torto#0000
Well, I work with brand strategy and design and I've had a design office for 20 years. I agree with Yasha, a project well done and with deep research can help something genuine and true to walk more and more to the right place. But this timing is not always perfect (the timing to spend 120k on a brand strategy). Sometimes some things need to happen in a project for other things to happen.


[05/03/2022 6:34 PM] glasgowm#0000
brand strategy helps sell those first principles to people who don‚Äôt care (or know they care) üôÇ - but yeh we have a pretty solid resource with the community currently and have made great strides with making it communicable

 Glasgow did a good point. Brand strategy is about communication. The need of communication is not exclusive for corporates.

 Ilya on the subject of communication, I would say you are one of the best communicators that ergo has, and you know everything about blockchain development and ergo, so it would be good if you can help with some tutorials, videos etc. We can make content to help communicate about what Ergo has to offer. If you have time


[05/03/2022 9:12 PM] oskin#0000

 The question is how to organize the production of such tutorials. From my experiance one lecture (~ hour long) takes 3-4 days to prepare, assuming you have  +-detailed plan of the course. 
For now it's unaffordable for most Ergo devs including me.


[05/03/2022 9:51 PM] AndyLowe#0000
> AndyLowe re @oskin: The question is how to organize the production... 
 
 Maybe we can come up with some ways to increase the efficiency and get the biggest result from the least drain on your time. We can even do some basic concepts in an interview (teacher and student) style which you would not even need to prepare for. I was actually thinking about this concept which I would call 'Please Explain' as a new video series, and it would be like conversational short videos (5-10mins) where 'the teacher' is just explaining something to 'the student' who is asking questions. Basic stuff, not things that will require preparation. We can hopefully communicate concepts in an accessible way. I was thinking to do different topics and use different 'teachers' depending on people's availability. It's just an idea, can see if it's any good


[05/03/2022 9:52 PM] AndyLowe#0000
I was thinking to ask people like yourself, armeanio, Dionysis, kushti, Marty, etc


[05/03/2022 9:58 PM] CW#0000
I'm happy to be a part of that as the student


[05/03/2022 10:07 PM] AndyLowe#0000
I was actually gonna try being the student on this one @seedubya (but I might be rubbish). Because the thing is you actually do know stuff.. you are doing the dev updates. Whereas I am not super knowledgeable so I represent the person who actually doesnt know the answers


[05/03/2022 10:07 PM] AndyLowe#0000
If that makes a difference, we will see


[05/03/2022 10:08 PM] AndyLowe#0000
Unless you can pretend to know less than you do. Might be a bit confusing for the audience when on the Dev updates you are meant to know loads about it in order to summarise the complex stuff


[05/03/2022 10:12 PM] AndyLowe#0000
We could also have different students depending on the difficulty of the subject matter


[05/03/2022 10:20 PM] CW#0000

 Sure thing! By no means am I knowledgable on the technical level, dont claim to. I would say I have a reasonable high level understanding of most concepts.

Hi all, update from me as I will soon be asleep, it's now 10pm AEST.

The first Dev Update recorded with Armeanio was released last week. From my perspective, I think the new format was well received. Learned quite a lot and made a number of adjustments to my set-up to make things look a bit better. Also think the nerves will die down considering the first one is out in the wild! 

Recording this week's Dev Update tomorrow.

A quick EIP27 update video will be recorded either tomorrow or Friday, my time. Explainer to say what EIP27 is and all things going well, when it will come into effect.

Continuing to write a script on ‚ÄúWhat is Ergo‚Äù. I'm putting quite a lot of time and effort into this. My goal is to create a go-to video resource for people, so want to do it justice both with content and production. This will include title slides, B roll footage and infographics. It's a fine line to break down concepts with enough information into easy digestible content yet not have a 2hr video.

Once I have the script drafted, it would be great if one or two could look over it for accuracy.

Reached out to Rob and co about possibility to host the first ‚ÄúDark Cave Miners‚Äù stream this weekend. I just need to make sure I‚Äôm comfortable with the stream controls and overlays. Thanks to Andy, exploring the possibility to have real time stats such as block height and what not displayed on the stream.

I‚Äôm quite happy with the direction things are headed, though must admit I am a little frustrated with the time it's taking to get things rolling. Hopefully, once this ‚ÄúWhat is Ergo‚Äù video is out, things will progress a lot faster!

As always, feedback and input would be appreciated!

Cheers!

Launching our new UI v2 on Monday.  Site will have improved stats and the basic frame work for integration of SubPooling including user based subpools.  

Once this is launched anyone can create a subpool with a few clicks of a button. 

Plasma is under development.  Currently being tested for functionality. Planning to launch a beta version with some basic functionality in the next couple of weeks.

Angie:
*- Past week we prepared a partnership with Indodax and an AMA. The AMA will take place on the 17th of May. Launched a press release. 
- We focused on the promotion of Ergo Hackathon on 15 platforms.
- We have 1 press release ready for our website relaunch. After today some small thing fixed, we will release it. There is some news ready to be released. Ledger integration and EIP27 and 1 more exchange listing.

- Preparing educational materials for ErgoHack with DeCo. 
- Bruno sent his materials to be edited, schedule for ErgoHack will be ready soon. We are trying to understand specific topics.
- One more AMA session with Bitcoincom is on the way. We will discuss more details next week I guess.
_Kushti:_ How many participants registered for ErgoHack? 
_Angie:_ 20 for now. I think we need to prolong the registration. I think it will be okay to prolong. 
_Kushti:_ You mean prolonging after 7th? 
_Angie:_ Yes, 1 week more. Some teams didn't register all participants. I will check the hackathon chatroom tomorrow.
_Kushti_: I am in discussion with whales. We will have additional prizes maybe as SigUSD or from DarkFund0. It will be more than twice the prize from the last one.
_Angie:_ We also said there will be additional prizes.

*Kushti:
*- For the whales and DarkFund0, I will try to finalize the things today then let's do announcements. It'll bring additional like 6k SigUSD in prizes.
- I am mostly concentrating on development work as usual. 
- EIP27 finalized, I made a forum post for instructions for mining pools, we are contacting pools.
- Currently we have many pools, we need to reach all of them in case of ill voting. To have them onboard. 
- Not sure what I'll do on Friday. yesterday we recorded a session for ErgoHack. 
- Also doing some writing targeting not for Ergo peopl <clipped message>


[05/04/2022 5:16 PM] root7Z#0000
*Foeniculum:
*- I'm focused on Ergnomes series three.
- I'm waiting to fix issues on NFT minting.
- Waiting to launch on 8th of May which will be with Ergo Fest. Hopefully the hype from Ergonauts will continue.
- I hope it will be good as the former one, ErgoHack Privacy was very useful.
- Let me know if anything is needed for ErgoHack.
- Working with Krasavice, dev from Skyharbor. The owner of Ergnome earn some items which will be used for summoning some features. Hopefully for this July.

[05/04/2022 6:23 PM] Marty#0000
Ergopad launched ErgoLend's first round of funding with off-chain fulfilment bots. Our last round, users were having to submit multiple times because transactions would hit the mempool then just disappear. Now, we have bots that resubmit until the tx goes through, or refund if erg price slips too far from oracle price. 

This has had some small issues but we are monitoring and the overall UX has been drastically improved. 

We are working on a notification system that can offer a push notification solution for those interacting with blockchain (using sockets). This will work for many application, including games who need to know what NFTs are being held by a wallet, to ensure in-game assets are up to date and to avoid exploits. We will run a service for various platforms who need this in a package, so they can focus on their off-chain code and leave the blockchain interaction to us if needed. 

We are discussing an ergoscript audit service. Luivatra noticed an exploit in Comet's new smart contract and the team has been notified. We will look to building an audit company in the coming months, so that new teams have someone to consult on their smart contracts before going live.

Set to release tweet at Tuesday 10pm UTC

your thoughts on this?
djed on cardano could be insovlent if it uses an oracle data which does not smooth the price change. Good oppurtunity for ADA shorters. if true, idk about their data source.


[05/11/2022 2:36 PM] glasgowm#0000
Not sure but I imagine anyone who tries to buy a worrying/shorting amount will just be turned away?


[05/11/2022 2:38 PM] mhs_sam#0000
yeah, that's probably the solution since COTI is the centralized manager here

[05/11/2022 3:14 PM] Armeanio#0000
Forwarded from unknown: Dear subscribers,
We are sharing some of our insights on the current situation specificly on LUNA & UST.
Macro backdrop: Fed announced 50bps hike last week and implied further aggressive hiking plan to sustain high inflation, both Nasdaq and Crypto are impacted and experienced large sell-off, with BTC testing the $30K support. The panic mode is prevailing in the crypto market
UST Depeg process:
* Trigger: 
On May 8th, LFG withdrew $150M UST from Curve's UST-3Crv pool in the preparation of the new 4 Crv Curve pool, but around 10 min later, an unknown address suddenly sold 84M UST in the UST-3Crv pool, and this caused the large imbalance of the pool, in order to recover the balance of the pool, LFG followed and removed another $100M UST. All the above LFG's operations were not broadcasted in advance, and resulted in rumors on Twitter that LFG is dumping the UST. Although Do Kwon clarified that purpose of the operation in Twitter immediately, the panic sentiment has been spread quickly across the crypto world, especially in the backdrop of crypto sell-off, and some Whale account on Binance started dumping UST as well, and this caused UST to fall to $0.95
* Depeg acceleration: 
The $0.95 depeg from weekends didn't recover immediately as LFG didn't take actions yet, and soon the UST from Anchor started joining the sell-off, this time, Do Know moved quickly and announced they will loan out their $750M BTC + $750M UST to market maker to help the repeg, although this helped UST to back to around $0.9, when market realized that LFG already spent all BTC reserves, the dead spiral continues again
* Last Resort: 
Given LFG cannot recover the peg by themselves, the market started expecting some new financing from other big players like Jump, Alameda, Binance, and Do Kwon twittered twice a new plan will be announced. Before the  announcement from Do Kwon published,  there were resources on <clipped message>

SigUSD has been running for ages and never lost its peg, even when erg dropped from $17 to $2.10. #Lunacrash  #StableCoin 

They keep saying DJED never lost its peg, but it's never been tested in the wild either.

Terra validators have decided to halt the Terra chain to prevent governance attacks following severe $LUNA inflation and a significantly reduced cost of attack.

Forwarded from louis_berlin_style: On a slightly more serious note:
This week has been very difficult for many people. I hope everyone is coping ok.
I want so share that it‚Äôs Mental Health Awareness Week runs from Monday 9 - Sunday 15 May 
because of the volatility of the products - I feel that crypto organisations have certain a duty of care to share guidance and facts about supporting mental health while investing in crypto. Everyone has experienced moments being in the space for so long, so it‚Äôs good to talk openly about this and form a healthy community culture around mental health. 
As a suggestion maybe the Ergo can make a few posts over the weekend for mental health awareness week. Perhaps by sharing resources to help people cope who might be facing mental health difficulties during this period.

Terra Ecosystem Revival Plan
There‚Äôs been several community and validator groups discussing launching a fork of the Terra chain to make the ecosystem whole from the UST depegging event. Wanted to offer my perspective on how this should be done.  As of this time, there are still several billion dollars worth of UST, and the value of Luna token has fallen to essentially zero....

I posted in the nautilus channel but wanted to suggest here as well. Does anybody have any idea what the process of getting better integration into koinly would be like?
Recently they implemented cardano native tokens and you can import public keys from Eternl wallet so that it integrates super easily:
https://koinly.io/integrations/eternl/
I know Yoroi had the ability to export public keys for Ergo so could probably be integrated into Nautilus or Mobile Wallet.
We would have to organize for a push to integrate Ergo native tokens as well, but given they just implemented Cardano tokens they should at least have an understanding of eutxo now which was a roadblock before.
I think this would be a huge quality of life improvement for the community as more new tokens start to pop up and tracking trading becomes more and more complicated

 I made a lot of requests back in 2019-20 , they were always slow with their terrible responses


[05/18/2022 2:33 PM] Tefcek21#0000
I remember that we had to submit 3 different listing request until we got ErgoPad listed... maybe worth to send another listing request again?


[05/18/2022 2:33 PM] Marty#0000
It took us a while to get an untracked listing but we just kept applying then out of nowhere it worked


[05/18/2022 2:35 PM] Tefcek21#0000
New people are always searching on platforms like CMC and CoinGecko therefore this should be prioritized. I will watch out for some contacts to speed up things

Ergonauts Biweekly 18 May 2022
Angie:
-Preparations are going for ErgoHack, have ideas for ErgoHack websites to implement this and next week. Preparing a proposal for ErgoHack participants
-This month we're going for ErgoSummit, preparing a schedule
-Negotiating with media organizations for media packages. Preparing press releases
-We have one sponsored article in collaboration with ErgoPad, one more article will be about our stable coin.
-About the AMA session we completed the document. Afterwards we are going with FMFW which is previously bitcoincom
root7z: I can help for the Summit about contacts and organization if needed
Angie: Yeah let‚Äôs brainstorm about the ideas in chat
Kushti: When is ErgoSummit?
Angie: In June
Kushti: ErgoVersary in July maybe we can combine them? 2 events would be hard
Armeanio: Maybe we make a week long event
Angie: Like ErgoHack Fest?
Kushti: Yeah 1st of july is important, it's the 3rd year event
Angie: Maybe we‚Äôll do it offline?
Kushti: It would be very tough to organize
Armeanio: Maybe we make it like a week-long run with community content on Ergo Youtube, not 10hours long like last year but chopped up in days.
Kushti: We can think an offline event another time maybe in autumn
Angie: I was thinking of moscow for developers
Kushti: For ErgoVersary it makes sense to make it more global. We may think of another Asian tour in autumn. 
Angie: What about the conference in October? How will we join?
Kushti: I'm making videos right?
Armeanio: It's in Denver I can join, they ask for some presentation. I also talked with Marty but not concrete plans yet
Angie: So okay no need for a booth now, it will be expensive
Armeanio: Yeah it's a Cardano event so I'm not sure what'll do in a Cardano event
Angie: Okay we're preparing the materials but not going for the booth
Kushti: Sounds good
Kushti:
-My next week schedule can be unstable
-Made two new versions of the node. Two days t <clipped message>


[05/18/2022 4:40 PM] root7Z#0000
Glasgow:
-Launched the website
-Main focus is on hackathon, most registered people are participating 
-Trying to keep up after this Terra fiasco, organizing discussions 
-Talking about Sigma Improvement Protocols that were dormant for a while
-Sigmanauts are coming, there are couple more candidates, organizing some small tasks to clarify rewards
Kushti: In regards with ErgoHack, I have approval from DarkFund0, 1k SigUSD
Armeanio: Did we hear anything back from GuapSwap?
Kushti: He is one of good whales, but not very responsible these days because of holidays
Armeanio: I‚Äôll try to get him this week
Sakata:
-Still working to finish my studies
root7z:
-Me too still studying, not any updates
-I will help for the next ErgoSummit-ErgoVersary organization
Noah:
-This week I worked on adding Dev Tools category to Sigmaverse and some new featured carousel images for anetabtc, ergopad, skyharbor, and nautilus 
-I have also been pursuing better integration for koinly. Still working on this if anybody has information about the process

Ergopad update from our marketing side: 
- Thinking about making general cryptocurrency posts on Reddit, where we include Ergo but don't make it an obvious Ergo shill. For example posts like "what cryptocurrencies will survive this bear market and why?" 
- Making a post something like this https://discord.com/channels/@me/937319533763518514/976247272411111455 asking for devs to come to Ergo and work on this innovative blockchain

[05/18/2022 10:27 PM] CW#0000
Hey guys, I've had a little going on unexpectedly in my personal life. Hopefully everything is ok in the coming days.
1. Streamed our first Dark Cave Miners video with the team from GetBlok. Was a little rushed with AV testing the hitting live so will be smoother going forward with scheduling. DCMs will stream weekly. We have been in contact with other mining influencers to come on as guests which is all coming together.
2. In addition to 1. I've been trying to make inroads into the YT/Twitter mining community which is going well. A number of them know of the mining algo and the pros but havent really looked into Ergo itself so i have been in their ears in DMs and what not.
3. Still drafting the What is Ergo script. People keep asking what is Ergos elevator pitch... it's a little difficult to summarise the feature set with a couple of sentences so finding that balance still. 
4. Record weekly dev update with Armeanio after getting home from hospital in a few hours. 
5. Started the RaspPi video, recorded up to active sync. the Pi is humming away now. will finish the video once its completed syncing. 
6. talk with ergo prism, we may be recording a vid in the coming days
7. Armeanio/Kushti would love for you guys to come on for a video maybe next week? Light hearted discussion. The feel I am going for is a relaxed forum where we can discuss anything happening with Ergo or crypto as a whole but also for the community to see a lighter side of the people behind Ergo

Hey Ergonauts! We got some problems with the permissions of the offline NFTS event in Sardinia, I'm thinking to send back all the ergs of the raffle, maybe funding the ergohackfest. I'm very disappointed but I must go back on my steps because for many reasons that location in Porto Cervo is  not available anymore. I'm very sorry to have made all this mess for nothing. Please, let me know what I can do with all those ergs. I also made a little poll on tweeter to hear what the community says. Please Vote

Ergo community please vote on this poll.
The offline event planned for this summer in Sardinia was canceled due to problems with permits on public land in the chosen location. What should we do with all these ergos in the wallet?

 my suggestion is to refund all donors. You will lose 10% (winner and service). I think you should refund all donors without any deduction. If it went through, I will refund you with 5% service fee at the end, so finally you will lose the 5% winner btw.

Was saying It because Night Owl was making the Ergo dApp connector package for react and we found some problems when providing both wallets Nautilus and Safew, I think we should just release the package only working with Nautilus for now, and maybe in the future update it allowing safew too


[05/23/2022 12:56 PM] glasgowm#0000
Don‚Äôt they both use the same library? I‚Äôd expect a conflict as a user and only have 1 enabled at a time.


[05/23/2022 12:57 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Always not good to build something targeting only one option, in my opinion.

 Since it is an ErgoHack goal, I wouldn't like to mark It as a "non-finished" goal when ErgoHack ends


[05/23/2022 1:00 PM] dann#0000
Is there any dApp implementing both Nautilus and Safew?


[05/23/2022 1:00 PM] glasgowm#0000
ergodex?


[05/23/2022 1:01 PM] glasgowm#0000
not used safew much but it‚Äôs worked the same places nautilus has IIRC


[05/23/2022 1:01 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Yes it should be fully compatible. I only used safew as dapp connector so far because of its ergopay bridge


[05/23/2022 1:02 PM] anon_br#0000
SAFEW and Nautilus have distinct connection APIs, ergoConnector.nautilus.connect() and ergoConnector.safew.connect(), the problem is that SAFEW overwrites Nautilus API when the user has both installed, so in such scenario, calling nautilus.connect() or safew.connect() will always call SAFEW


[05/23/2022 1:03 PM] dann#0000
Hmmm I see, that s the problem I saw, didnt know It was because of overwriting Nautilus API


[05/23/2022 1:04 PM] dann#0000
(re @glasgowm : *ergodex?*) 
 
 Doubt it, when I had installed both Safew and Nautilus and tried connecting to ErgoDex, It would just try to connect to safew as Anon said


[05/23/2022 1:05 PM] dann#0000
But not because I clicked on "safew" option, I chose Nautilus, well there was no safew option anyway in Ergodex

I'm just waiting to gather the rest of the funds, surely will refund all the donors! Thank's everyone.  I gave up this project and getting some offline time for me to think.

 Yeah reading this i cant tell if you plan to refund or not? Could you clarify


[05/24/2022 9:47 PM] ErGonario#0000
I Will Noah. Daniu, I can't now, because I want refund averything together, as MHS_Sam suggested, and I'm missing 145ergs. I have to share that with Li3Re. That's the reason.


[05/24/2022 9:48 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I dont understand, why hold the raffle in the first place?


[05/24/2022 9:51 PM] dann#0000
I dont either understand the time offline to think, you are taking a break right when you got a big amount of Ergs via a raffle, it looks sus to me, just saying my thoughts dont want to be disrespectful.


[05/24/2022 9:55 PM] ErGonario#0000
I understand your points guys. "It was just my paranoia", just want to be safe, It was a shared wallet. You can check the address anytime you want. I think that in a few days all the ergs will be inside the founders wallets. I'm not working right now, and can't afford to use my money to pay back the founders right now, and I'm Sorry about It. If you guys think that It Is not fair I understand It, but this are the reasons.


[05/24/2022 10:00 PM] ErGonario#0000
Anyway don't want to look dodgy. I Will start sending the ergs right now, no problem. Will start from the smaller donor and for the last batch will send the 145erg when I'll get them. I'm very sorry about this. Just wanted to be fair with everyone.


[05/24/2022 10:03 PM] dann#0000
Dont get me wrong, if the ergs will be back into the funders wallets in a few days that s more than fair and good bud

 I probably explained it in the wrong way, my bad.  Everything was sent minus 145 ergs. I'm Sorry about It, I really don't want to look like a scammer or something.  I Will send the rest of the ergs, when I'll get them.

Ergo should be a smart contract platform rather than Cardano Ecosystem.

Hi guys, I think we need to add Social Channels to the bottom of ergoplatform.org just like what Cardano do so that Ergo community members can find their official local community channels, thus preventing scam channels.

Some thoughts from my side:¬†
We launched ErgoHack for Developers, the participation and contribution is amazing, but I do think it's necessary, to provide opportunities for non developers too. How can we get a mass adaption or better said, how can we better explain what Ergo is trying to build and provide? We should more focus on explaining such content to people having zero knowledge about coding and tech. Therefore, I suggest that we launch such contest for non-devs such as a media contest, in which we launch a prize pool for providing articles, explaining content, some sort of shilling, media and artworks, social content and any type of contribution in these niche.¬†
What I'm trying to say is delivering a good tech and platform is important, but explaining and involving the rest of our community is important too.

 Or maybe it could be nice to have some workshop or event before the hack, where only non - developers discuss different ideas and brainstorm what could be built. Then after they come up with their ideas, they go forth and find developers to join their teams

Forwarded from unknown: 1. I am the creator and I am providing all of the liquidity. GramSwap is a CEX however I have the intention of decentralizing portions of the exchange over time. I am currently developing a Ecosystem Update that will be the foundation to allow others to provide liquidity as well as earn staking rewards, and more. 
2. Yes this project is very new and I have not taken the time to provide documentation on the website itself. I intend to provide more documentation after the Ecosystem Update is completed since it will be required; it will include a Developer API, and instructions to become a member of the ecosystem and later on how to run a node, etc
3. Yes, I have ERG implemented and I have tested it locally so it is pretty much ready to ship out. I am currently finishing a feature that will allow swapping tokens that are exchanged in different exchanges; Multi-Exchange swaps, I intend to finish this feature and ship it alongside ERG support

In the recent days, I saw several debates in tw regarding PoS and PoW. Would be great if we can jump in to gain some attentions to Ergo's PoW.
These debates might be accelerated due to recent proposals of PoS-ed Bitcoin. It's however a two sided blade for us, since we might have some debates with Cardano fans.

What are some talking points you like to bring up?


[05/26/2022 9:39 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
For me, i like to bring up market externalities. People always say in PoW the rich only get richer because they can afford the best hardware and control the supply chain. This is true of ASIC mined chains, but not of ASIC resistant chains like ergo where consumer grade hardware is just as competitive. 

Add to the fact that in PoW the rich must spend money in the economy to build and maintain their mine, whereas with PoS if the rich have more tokens than you, they will always make more profit, forever, and nothing external to system will affect their profits. It also requires zero economic input to continue, so that disconnect from any external economy makes it hard to justify using as a global store of value.

Would be up to the tokenomics of the project behind it, but its a cool idea


[06/01/2022 2:47 AM] Rongrong21#0000
Every new project may reserve a small sum of fund for this incentive action.


[06/01/2022 3:25 AM] Rongrong21#0000
Alternatively, the projects that have completed IDO via Ergopad and participated in previous hackathons may donate for hackthons using a small portion of their reserved marketing tokens. This is similar to that the excellent graduates from top global universities come back to donate for their old universities when they make a lot of money.


[06/01/2022 3:30 AM] Rongrong21#0000
The universities will have continuous fund sources to fund their building and cultivate more excellent graduates to create more values for the society. I think this applies to ergohacks. Ergohack serves as a university and the project serves as an excellent graduate.

Hey guys, I've tried to stay up though can now hardly keep my eyes open.

On the Twitter front, continuing with the usual on the EP account. Chiming into comments where I see fit. Any comments on how I've transitioned the messaging is appreciated.

Trialing different managment software for scheduling to see what best suits our needs. One day left with buffer free trial, moving onto hoot suite next.

Trying to concentrate a little and make inroads on the mining front in Twitter leading up the Eth Merge.


I've been a little quiet on the vid front, had a couple fall through from the holiday weekend in the US and others feeling unwell. Hopefully get those rescheduled shortly. 

Kicked off Dark Cave Miners with the GetBlok guys, 2 live streams and have gone well. Learned a lot just from those 2 alone on the live process and running OBS.

Bought components for a mining rig and will do an Ergo oriented build video piecing that together once it turns up.

Recorded a vid on syncing a raspberry pi 4 but with node *.28 took too long sync headers and gave up. Tried *.31 this afternoon and was much better. Formatted and set up new OS install and will re record that one in the morning.

Continuing with the weekly dev updates with Armeanio. I'm really enjoying these now that the nerves have settled.


Sigmanauts, couple of brief comments between Glasgow and I regarding incentives

Holding the first Sigmanut monthly catch up zoom call this Sunday to touch base, share ideas and what each other are working on.

*Discussion
*_Kushti:_ We started to judge ErgoHack submissions. Judging will take up to 10 days. Angie, what do you think? Usual time would be too optimistic
_Angie:_ I have 1 more week optionally so 13th of June also works. 
_Kushti:_ Then, we need to plan the summit
_Angie:_ Let‚Äôs talk about it at the end of the week. Not completed the document and let's define concept
_Kushti:_ Yes
_Armeanio:_ How will the Summit be organized? Ergo Summit week or what's the game plan?
_Angie:_ I want to extend the time, if we request videos it takes 2-4 weeks to provide materials, for example if we start this week and we reach out the other week so we have 1 month. And we have also promo month that Andy and I decided to do 2 times a year and the Summit might be the same that we post videos throughout the month. We need to decide the topics. 
_Armeanio:_ I recommend 1 change, that we might set up calls with CW. It will be easier than collecting videos from participants.
_Angie:_ We can discuss it with CW too, how can we organize.
_Armeanio:_ I can talk too, I try to add him to BPSAA also.
_Angie:_ We can think of a trendy topic that we can discuss and then prepare a list of participants.
_Armeanio:_ We need 3 parts: external, community and core.
_Kushti:_ Sounds good. We can have even different sections, different texts, colors
_Angie: _Okay, got it

My updates;

Sorry I missed the call, I'm on full time dad duty today because my wife is has a mild case of covid.

- ergohack
videos all done (apart from the reveal of the winners). I was thinking it could be nice to reveal the winners in video form, perhaps showing each judges vote (Eurovision style) for full transparency.. 

- ecosystem promo month
It was a decent success, perhaps we could have had more entries, but some projects didn't have time. Still awaiting Skyharbors video. Like Angie said, we can repeat it every 6 months. I'm hoping it can be a nice spotlight on the ecosystem especially for outsiders who want a snapshot of what's been built.

- Channel
Passed 5000 subscribers
Passed 250,000 views 

I will be away from June 9 - 12, so I will be miss that AMA on June 10.

Forwarded from unknown: GramSwap Update: ERGO Support + Multi-Exchange swaps

*BRIEF

*- ERGO Support
- Multi-Exchange Swaps
- Swap Fee calculation update
- Minor UI changes, automation & processing improvements

*ERGO

*You can now swap your mined ERGO for XRP or any other token on GramSwap. Swapping ERGO has browser wallet support. The "Nautilus" browser wallet was chosen as the supported browser wallet since it is well designed and appears to be properly maintained so it is recommend when swapping as it will automate the process.

NOTICE: When Swapping ERGO for something like XRP, a transaction can take a couple of minutes to be confirmed on the ledger, from testing it appears to take between 2-5 minutes. In other words, after sending your ERGO, it will take up to 5 minutes for GramSwap to acknowledge your funding and send you your swapped tokens.

Swapping the other way around is a bit faster (e.g TON/XRP for ERGO) since the service will consider sending the ERGO to you as succesful as soon as it is in the mempool and before there is a single confirmation. This means the transaction will appear as succesful but the amount of ERGO you receive will not appear on your wallet for 2-5 minutes (Until there is at least 1 confirmation).

I am wondering if I should consider a tx in the mempool as reliable instead of waiting for a node confirmation, however I have not been able to find any information about double-spending vulnerabilities or lack-thereof, if it is determined to be reliable I may be able to reduce the wait time when swapping ERGO for another token to less than a minute.

*Multi-Exchange Swaps

*It is now possible to swap any token for any other token regardless of whether or not they are found in the same exchange. GramSwap will automate the process of coordinating the exchange & transfers between separate exchanges in order to allow you to swap any token pair, seamlessly. This means you c <clipped message>

Forwarded from LuivatraEP: Yes, but vested or staked tokens won't be burned, they just can't be taken out of the contract, so they will be released due to storage rent in a couple of years


[06/10/2022 12:11 PM] Rongrong21#0000
@LuivatraEP  does this mean the ergo tokens including ergopad, paideia, egio and exle that are inaccessible to its holders due to key losses will be recovered via ergo storage rent by ergo miners?


[06/10/2022 12:15 PM] Rongrong21#0000
that is, all lost or forgot ergo tokens including erg, ergopad, paideia and so on can be re-released and circulated again via storage rent? if yes, this means ergo miners will have more revenue sources to secure the ergo network?


[06/10/2022 12:20 PM] Rongrong21#0000
if this is true, this will be big good news to ergo miners. Chinese miners are worrying about their income sources when erg block rewards comes to an end.

 yes, via storage rent you will get erg boxes which can include tokens.

The txs failed yesterday, will be resubmitted today


[06/12/2022 12:38 PM] kushti#0000
(re @Frostyausty : *The txs failed yesterday, will be resubmitted today*) 
 
 Recent versions of the node do not accept into their mempools transactions of more than 96 KB in serialized length, by default. So your tx with 20K outputs having size of more than 1MB got propagated around few nodes only. Unlikely miners do run old version or override default limit at the moment.


[06/12/2022 1:39 PM] Rongrong21#0000
@kushti_ru yesterday, Chinese community members discussed with me on the transaction priority fee on ergo network which is similar to the ethereum gas fee. if the transaction priority fee still exists on ergo, that will mean the fee may be uncappped. the miners will with priority process the transactions that provide high priority fees and the transactions with the minimal fee set by regular users may be rejected to enter the pool especially when congestion comes to ergo.  


for this reason, I have an idea that why not divide transactions into different tiers based on their urgency. for example, tier 1, 50sigusd per transaction, tier 2, 40sigusd per transaction, tier 3, 30sigusd, ... tier 10, 5 sigusd per transaction, .... tier 20 minimal fee. of course, these figures may be changed as the case may be. in this way, the maximum priority fee will be fixed to avoid the extreme condition that thousands of sigusd dollars will be charged against  a transcaction that containes 100 million sigusds.


[06/12/2022 2:12 PM] kushti#0000
Tx fee is not part of the core protocol. Currently miners are using the node to form block candidates, and the node is just deterministically sorting transactions by fee per byte. Could be not ideal in many situations. But hopefully this year  we will provide an interface to miners to form block candidates on their side (which is harder than in Bitcoin, as more data structures and rules here), then different miners can follow different strategies


[06/12/2022 2:17 PM] Rongrong21#0000

Hi everyone.

Sorry, will not be able to join today.

Updates from my end:
1. Financial report and Budgeting have been completed and shared with EF;
2. Now we have a virtual debit card and can send bank transfers via Global Unit Pay; however, we do not have IBAN for now. The work there is on progress. I will keep you posted accordingly.

Thank you

Did you know? ISPOs where not covered anywhere in the history Cardano research on blockchain security or the incentives model. Ada was considered as the underlying security asset but not native assets. ISPOs are more like an oversight (a bug, not a feature).

 Would be good to compare jitc vs aotc for real world contracts!

Real world contracts? Alex can you elaborate?


[06/24/2022 1:53 PM] CMParada#0000
I have been recently in talks with some pool operators (pos, mind you) of waves enterprise and I'm feeling positive about sparking some interest towards us, we should expect increased mining activity soon.

 could you elaborate on this?


[06/24/2022 10:25 PM] CMParada#0000
Is just that some pool operators that usually focus on POS are thinking to take the step towards expanding their operations in the POW world and I'm trying to evangelize them a bit about Ergo, that's all.

- Also with Pirate chain,
- Hash-it-Out videos,
- Weekly dev updates,
- I'm in contact with Rob from Getblok to get out a video in Ergoversary. We are figuring out a time as he is traveling currently. Might be able to do it on Monday. Maybe we move Skyharbor up front.

*Glasgow:
*- Past few weeks. doing dev stuff and contributing pages

 Hi guys, my updates:

Missed 2 AMAs due to wedding and subsequent holiday, back in the game now and ready to push on. Last week's AMA was smooth, and I am continuing to do the usual dev updates, helping CW with hash it out,  and preparing for ergoversary (processing videos) and tonight and tomorrow I will be scheduling them all. I created a new intro animation to, it shows the change from the old style to the new and is meant to visually celebrate the progress of ergo since the beginning:

@kushti_ru do you have some release notes for 5.0? IE what has changed and why


[06/30/2022 7:29 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
I don't want to make a mistake when I'm sharing the info with the community, and we'd like to mention it in Proof of Ergo


[06/30/2022 7:29 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Is this correct: 
"5.0 brings in some interesting new features including JIT costing. That means that smart contracts will cost less, and network congestion will be reduced! "


[06/30/2022 7:30 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
I think it could be a worthwhile thing to make a big deal about

Forwarded from unknown: To the Ergo Team,

First off, want to say thank you for nurturing a great community and holding the ErgoHacks that motivate many people around the world to build on Ergo.

With that being said, I think there are some improvements that could be made to the ErgoHack process to ensure fairness and to streamline the judging process to be as transparent as possible. 

There was improvement in this area this time around by releasing the judges on the panel but there is still no clear criteria on what is judged. In this last ErgoHack, it seemed pretty arbitrary on the selection process as some of the winners did not submit any code and only provided a short description of what they wanted to do.

Nothing wrong with this and nothing against the teams, but there were many other teams that provided a lot more concrete work and details into their implementation. Yes, I say this from our own perspective, representing Night Owl, but also many other teams that submitted  with a great deal of explanation, code, insight, plans, etc.

One of the possible solutions is to create a simple criteria table listing 5-8 different judging points. These points can have a description mentioning what they will judge on and should be released to the community. Then each judge can go through each row, giving a score of 1-10. Then the teams with the highest points win.

Again, love this community and the teams building on it, so it‚Äôs nothing personal. Just felt it was the right thing to do for me to address. Much love to you all üíú

Hearing some rumours that KuCoin could be halting withdrawals in the near future. 

Apparently they ‚Äúsuffered immensely‚Äù from the $LUNA collapse. 

If you have funds on KuCoin, consider withdrawing them. After all, it‚Äôs better to be safe than sorry given recent events.

Partitions are always possible afaik (CAP Theory) - fault tolerant (partitioned network) consensus (availability and consistency) is unachievable in asynchronous systems, but he assumes no partition can be tolerated while maintaining consistency and availability, but this can be easily observed to not be the case.

So the more appropriate questions are:

How severe of a Partition can the system tolerate, while maintaining both Consistency and Availability?
When the system cannot maintain both Consistency and Availability, which is lost?

 I've read them yes, I don't agree with the messaging or the way it's presented. I.e singling out clauses of a contract.

Ergo has had quiet serious and somewhat complicated messaging regarding the tech etc. I feel these fall into that category.

Everything I've been working towards since taking on my role with Ergo is the messaging from the socials, making a more simplified, approach to garner more engagement and outreach for the everyday person.

I've had numerous comments internally and externally that they like this new approach to bring awareness to both Ergo and the projects building in the ecosystem.

Market sentiment aside, I believe that it is working


[07/10/2022 4:56 AM] marty_ergopad#0000

yes the user adds a purpose message.
it is not appkit that can't parse the tx @mhs_sam node is failing on costing. that's why we already have a wallet app release removing the purpose message from the app. no one noticed that it makes problems with proxy addresses, and I did only test the feature with p2pk addresses.
Most users don't specify a purpose message when sending to a contract, that's why you see it in most cases with the same address - that user does it

*Ergonauts Biweekly 13 July 2022

Angie:
*- Completed ErgoVersary campaign.
- Previous week, did some organizational stuff, made landing page, collect statistics from press releases
- Collected a list of offline events for 2022
- We have a list of articles pending to be released
- We have one more announcement about ErgoSummit
- Waiting some update in Ergo chat about Summit
- In the spreadsheet, I see we have materials to be released. Waiting to include this info to the announcement. 1 press release pending for the event. 
- We have testing 2 more writers that are in house writers

*Armeanio:
*- Doing a lot of video stuff. Dev update with CW, Joined an interview yesterday. The day before made HashItOut
- Pushing for exchange listings
- Talking with Alex about long term goals

*Glasgow:
*- Shot video with CW Tuesday for Summit
- Getting Ergo History for an ErgoVersary text
- NFT server
- I'll be away from Saturday

*Anastasia:
*- We are trying to get IBAN as soon as possible.
- I try to communicate with our partners in Global Union. No update yet, will share when I have
- Plan is to have IBAN and problem solved, if not we'll try something else
- Financial report and budgeting done

_Armeanio:_ Are ErgoHack payments sent?
_Anastasia:_ Only one pending and I still have 8k SigUsd fund
_Angie: _Mark please send community favorites selections‚Äô payment, 40erg for payments

*Sakata:
*- Summit is my concern at the moment. Lot of guests decline participation. We've got 7 confirmations and we have three who haven't got back yet. Kushti is doing a different video based on ErgoScript so we technically have 8. About the deadline, which is 15th, we might have a few overhangs. I still haven't done mine yet. We should get about 10 videos.
- Also I'm happy to help out with AMA or Dev update videos if yo want

_Angie: _Need to understand what to do with Summit; do you have any videos?

They said only thing we can do is make more noise on the proposal with likes and comments. Otherwise devs will ignore it. Would love any support you guys can offer in sharing this message, thanks!

Most long-term Blbitcoiners are too tired to engage with this bullshit again, but for the one of you new around here: "PoS" is logically broken (specifically: circular), as explained to Wei Dai in 1998 and as definitely crystalized by Andrew Poelstra here:

Giacomo is a good guy and most of the time I agree with what he says (as the general content PoS vs PoW within this tweet), even if I really don't like his maxi-know-it-all tone.

[07/26/2022 9:35 PM] CW#0000
(re @Tefcek21 : *Is there any Ergo merchandise? üëÄ*) 
 
 I've looking into getting a fair few things made (t-shirts, hats, flags, cups) and shipped off to various people, in particular mining influencers. 

Shipping cost isn't feasible doing it from Australia unfortunately. Cost to ship one product is the same, if not more than the product itself.

I need to look into something from the US/EU


[07/26/2022 9:36 PM] Tefcek21#0000
Maybe we could partner with a merchandise company and sell some. Additionally we can do giveaways and also reward active members with small gifts?


[07/26/2022 9:36 PM] Tefcek21#0000
They usually have lower costs and lower shipping prices.


[07/26/2022 9:36 PM] AngieHar#0000

 Yes sure, we sent some t shirts as a giveaway and also after one hackathon 
But it was too hard to control actually, they mixed everything

*Ergonauts Biweekly 27 July 2022

Angie:
*- In regards to the Summit, we have 8 confirmed participants. It's around 5 hours of content. Ergodex wants to run a live AMA for the summit.
- We had to shift Summit to August because most people are on breaks. We are still waiting for participants to provide contents for August, the date limit is 11th of August. Waiting for materials, and a few more articles based on videos.
- For the upcoming hackathon ,we have not defined dates but it‚Äôll be sometime in September. Since the first Bruno who wants to sponsor, we are discussing the contents, he has some specific ideas for this event so we are discussing contents and we'll launch as soon as possible. Maybe we can find more sponsors.
- I want to connect to some VC funds for the hackathon, starting with Ergo miners, it'll about the ecosystem. For now I have 2 soft commitments who are investors who fund hackathons but we need to get a presentation first to them. We need to look at other ecosystems like Solana, they are giving grants etc. maybe we can get some sponsors etc.
- I sent a new task to the copywriter but it's summer break. I researched some information for how to reconstructure content strategy for blog, to make it more useful for our target audience, working this with Sean. 
- Conference previous week, pitched Ergo, connected with new marketing agencies who provide journalism services but it's not very easy because of the editorial team. We are in contact with another influencer with 100k subscribers.
- I started a conversation with CyberAcademy and CryptoAcademy. CyberAcademy is a Russian speaking community so we can make several AMAs, waiting for confirmation. Maybe we can provide some courses like UDEMY. CryptoAcademy has a good user base of developers so they can promote our hackathons to get more people from outside.

*Anastasiia: 
*- Not much updates about IBAN yet.
- We got refused from Lithuania and Switzerland so we still continue.
- Alex sent me one website of a German bank but I'm not sure about geopolitics so I need to hear advice. Should we continue with alternatives or we switch to Dubai for opening a company.
_Armeanio:_ I think for the short term Dubai can be on our roadmap at least for payment to greenhat.
_Anastasiia:_ For sending a 3rd party we need IBAN. Global Union pay refused first options to open so we continue. So we need IBAN and geopolitics is complicated. We can work either direction so we need to find someone from Dubai. I'll arrange a meeting with Nikita to find out about this company. Here in Russia the link didn't go through. So I think it won't work but we should keep trying
_Armeanio: _I agree

*Sakata:
*- Past couple weeks working on Horizon episode on ErgoCast, was pretty hefty.
- Working on another episode but not so practical episode. 
- With ErgoSummit I'm recording an episode with ErgoLend
- I have problems on ZK-Treasury due to the fact on how to generate a smart contract payment on testnet.
- In general ErgoSummit can be a little bit better.
- Been brainstorming other things along with Summit and Hackathon and things that we can do as a project but have not come up with anything yet.

_CW:_ There is also a community organized a treasure hunt, I hid one in HashItOut. We will do it one more on Weekly Developer Update so I think it's good for engagement. Sigmavalley is also involved it will be a fun topic
_Sakata:_ I can also add a bit on videos
_CW:_ I'll send you a DM on discord
_Sakata:_ We'll be doing in 2.5 hours

just a comment, Germany's banks are not crypto-friendly. only exception is fidor partnering with kraken.
cypto-friendliest country around is Liechtenstein


[07/27/2022 4:23 PM] filippounits#0000
Here in Panama City Towerbank had declared itself crypto-friendly and is open to receive private entities and financial institution. Thinking about the geopolitical situation, Panama has clearly declared itself neutral. I think it would be worth a try

@kushti_ru @Armeanio I am working with a couple teams that need to develop some oracles for their platforms. These are oracles that can pick up data like sports outcomes, or info for synthetic stocks. If you're free to discuss this with the teams, and bring in other relevant people, maybe it would be good to work together to build these systems in a general way for the ergo ecosystem


[07/27/2022 5:13 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Much like how plasma is helping us expand our capabilities, we'd like to build oracles that help everyone else as well

 Yes we also had a discussion about this at Night Owl, unfortunately every single betting house has mistakes, a mistake on an hypothetical decentralized betting house that cant suspend a concrete game bet would lead to instant pool draining

No actual retrieving odds from any offchain source

Oh I see


[07/27/2022 5:41 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
you can pay for sport result data streams, but it would be better to decentralize that


[07/27/2022 5:42 PM] dann#0000
Ideally yes, and would that sports result be always accurate?


[07/27/2022 5:42 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
when you pay for the data stream it's likely very accurate, but it would be a centralized source and costly


[07/27/2022 5:42 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
it isn't cheap.

Great news. Will release first public plugin tomorrow


[07/27/2022 6:15 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
So far my only other feedback would be that the button which opens the transaction in a browser window is using a "share" icon, but i think it might make sense to use a "link" icon or something more self explanatory. At first I thought there was no way to open in browser


[07/27/2022 6:15 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Or perhaps the transaction ID could be the link to open in browser, and the share icon could be replaced with a copy to clipboard icon on desktop


[07/27/2022 6:21 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Ah thanks for the feedback. Yes direct copy of the mobile UI but there is no share action on desktop üòâ noted to change to link icon!


[07/27/2022 6:30 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
if i sync it and walk away, it says "synced just now" even if its been several minutes. Maybe it could say "synced at X time" if it can't update automatically as time passes, like on mobile

 Usually done via a signature from data provider, so you moving trust from an oracle to data provider, federated Oracles like oracle pools also help by spreading trust

An interesting update from me:

Petur the Product Manager at Koinly showed up and has been asking questions in dev support channel about ergo after my months of asking them to integrate lol. Reached out to him directly and he says:

‚ÄúReally appreciate your support! We're still just in the planning phase but we'll surely have some questions once the devs start working on it later this year‚Äù

Excited that I was able to get some movement on this


[08/01/2022 8:55 PM] NoahErgo#0000
also have been communicating with the gemlink devs about their wallet integration that was voted on a few weeks back. Have been talking with them to make sure it isn‚Äôt another viawallet situation where it burns tokens. So far seems safe but too early too know for certain

Something no one is talking about:  after the Merge, there's will be a strong case that Ether will be a security. The token in any proof of stake system is likely to be a security.

I am uncovering what seems to be a massive widespread malware attack on @github.

- Currently over 35k repositories are infected
- So far found in projects including: crypto, golang, python, js, bash, docker, k8s
- It is added to npm scripts, docker images and install docs

 Very bad news


[08/10/2022 4:07 PM] root7Z#0000
*Ergonauts Biweekly 10 August 2022

Angie:
*- We have 2 events to discuss:
- First is ErgoSummit, which will be held tomorrow. We discussed it with Andy, waiting for him to upload all videos to Youtube channel. Wee have 8 videos. Schedule will start at 12 UTC with Kushti, then we'll have an AMA with a special guest from ErgoDEX, Ilya. Then we'll have interviews which CW hosted and Frosty, Bruno. It was a bit challenging to gather videos because of summer break but it will continue all day long. So the event will take place tomorrow.
- Another one is our Hackathon that will take place somewhere in September, late Sep or beginning of October. Concept is under development. I want to discuss this. Firstly the main topic is DeFi, maybe Alex can help with brainstorming and give some thoughts about the topic. Let‚Äôs discuss it later
- We have a promotion for 4 weeks, then 2 weeks for registration, then 2 weeks of coding. Main change from the previous one that it will have specific categories and judges will vote more easily. We are talking with Bruno, he wanted to be sponsor of this event but can't be the sole sponsor, so we were discussing this mostly. There is one category from him called Alliancing SigmaUSD, he's proposing some ideas for improvement. Then DeFi infrastructure and Web3 builders. Please add any ideas
- We have a list of contents to cover these topics, every info is pinned in the event chatroom so we need to start promotion and change content on the website. Sean will also go on vacation next week and he'll be off for 2 weeks. We have writers but he is the editor so it‚Äôs better to prepare now. I need some help about some tasks for promotion. 
- And besides this we have some pending announcements. I'm waiting for these to be released. They'll be about mining and exchanges. Basic information prepared for press releases.
- We have some presentations about the Ergo ecosystem. I'm talking wit <clipped message>


[08/10/2022 4:07 PM] root7Z#0000
*Sakata:
*- I went back to first summit in 2021 and wrote descriptions for each of the videos. 
- Recorded video with Chris Ray
- I got an episode on programmable money
- Happy to help out in upcoming hackathon
_Angie:_ First we need to understand the topic to prepare the initial documentation
_Glasgow:_ I think education could be good topic
_Angie:_ Okay if any other ideas please discuss, please check the document on the chatroom so we can start promotion in August
_Sakata:_ What kind of tasks there are for the hackathon?
_Angie:_ I put all the promotion to the document, for more detail you can reach out to me. I have the documentation, the main thing is to update the information on the website and promote on external channels.

 You will find that indodax is usually a quite underestimated exchange, been a great liquidity source for waves through the years and is one of the best options if not the best in SEA.

Also a solid ramp up/down crypto for Singapore/Indonesia/Malaysia.

he ran a regional chat or two. Can‚Äôt remember which but Iranian/Persian, Arabic, and Portugese were all ran by people filling it with low-effort bots. Jose and Marcelo managed to sneak everyone out the Portugese group because the owner didn‚Äôt even speak Portugese or knew how Telegram worked üòÖ

nasty, gotta be careful with these regional chat admins :S


[08/12/2022 2:59 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
But then tried to blackmail people for money for filling these servers with bots, refusal to pay meant spam attacks

Yeah a few of them had owner rights and muted the groups, tried to flood the main tg with 10k+ bots

 yes I know, since the diff in eth is adjusting very fast only one miner can reach the target. that's only funny to imagine a big f to vitalik

I was thinking of a video section somewhere, probably in sigmaverse.io, which collects the youtube vids regarding ergo. specially vids from outsiders like max maher, sonofatech, Charles H,...

any opinions?

[08/13/2022 12:13 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
Then you got a bunch of platforms in the pipeline who are slowly getting their friends to onboard before it's too late. Spreadly, Dan's zengate

And spectrum rebranding


[08/13/2022 12:13 AM] mhs_sam#0000
(re @marty_ergopad : *What to mine now showing ergo as #2 behind eth*) 
 
 depends on the GPU, on some of them ERG is more profitable (checked 1 hour ago)


[08/13/2022 12:14 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
But it's a cascade. People see it going up so they fomo in


[08/13/2022 12:14 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
Which causes it to go up which causes people to fomo in

[08/13/2022 12:15 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
It also has 0 gas fees. Partly the reason people went to BSC is because it's eth with low gas fees. So ergo is BSc but way better


[08/13/2022 12:16 AM] CW#0000
(re @marty_ergopad : *Then more poeole start looking into it and realize this is the ONLY POW chain with smart contracts now*) 
 
 I've made a big effort to engage with the miner "influencers" over 3 months or more. 

Its amazing how little many of them know about coins outside of Eth. Been in their DMs slaving away üòÖ

Yeah honestly PoS was kinda the new thing last bull run. Every new coin was a POS L1. Ergo is the only altcoin that's actually an iteration on Bitcoin


[08/13/2022 12:22 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
Yield


[08/13/2022 12:22 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
People love yield. That pulls a ton of people who don't care about crypto


[08/13/2022 12:23 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
On BSC there were platforms that would add their own staking on top of other more popular staking platform's


[08/13/2022 12:24 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
So you'd add liquidity to pancakeswap then you could stake the LP tokens, but then you could stake those LP tokens on pancake bunny and get bunny tokens on top of cake tokens.. and stack and stack. Most of them were scams but BNB went from $4 to $600 in matter of months because of those. 

So erg has a chance to do something similar, without the scams


[08/13/2022 12:24 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
Though the scams will probably find their way over, we'll stay the course and keeping building solid stuff, and if people show up because of yield and find the good stuff we're doing, great


[08/13/2022 12:26 AM] LuivatraEP#0000
If this actually brings users it will be a long painful wait for 5.0

real fomo kicks in when people grasp that they can buy one day of network's work in 2026 with only $7500 today. And, Ergo will go through 4 halvings (bitcoin-wise) in 4 years.

We use IFTTT for our twitter which forwards to discord and tele.  Not bad but a little delayed.  Careful with Reddit automation.  My long term account was instantly banned for using it.

It is reported that some Chinese erg holders store their ergs in TP wallets and cannot get back their money any more. I think it is necessary to tweet that TokenPocket Wallet has not been integrated into Ergo and request the erg holders to adopt Ergo wallets published on ergoplatform website.

 I dont see that ergo is supported in that wallet.. how did they even store it?

 IFTTT takes the old basic/visual basic IF X THEN Y command and put it on steroids, is quite cool, you can "link' real life devices automation" with SSMM as well, would be cool to see some smart contract integrations on it btw, I've talked a few times with Waves Enterprise Devs about this.


[08/15/2022 4:56 AM] CMParada#0000
You can link a lot of stuff with events N triggers from SSMM

[08/18/2022 2:40 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Forwarded from NoahErgo: Preliminary ideas for Ergohack: The Merge

Announced Just before the time of the merge, maybe September 10 or so?
Event mid October maybe October 15/16
Intro video: Collection of videos by influencers -  what do people want?
   - SOAT - DJ Waters - Hobbyistminer - Chump Change - Red Panda Mining - maybe    Flux?

Closing Video: could be Alex or Joe talking about the post merge world for miners and PoW, importance of capturing attention of miners, miners are users, etc.

 This interests me.  Me and my team have been discussing how we can support a Hackathon.  We were originally thinking a tie in with some of the local programs we are signing up for with local colleges and tech organizations in Pittsburgh.  Would love to support a mining themed hackathon.

Hey, I was just wondering if the Ergo foundation employed any designers or graphic artists that could be able to assist us in creating fresh pictures for mining. 

Short postings with attractive designs, especially now that the EthereumMerge is a major dilemma, in my opinion, could encourage more people to join Ergo. Daily tweets regarding mining connected to the EthereumMerge have been sent out by Flux, and the attention they are receiving is enormous. 

To bring in more individuals, we should start launching significant promotional campaigns.

Also instead of having long interviews about mining, shorter videos on twitter could get more attention. 

Especially videos, in which the content is explained shortly and point forward.

üö® Parallel #mining is changing the game! 

It dramatically improves the profitability of Flux #GPU mining. 

For every native #Flux earned by a miner or a node operator, an additional 10% of each parallel asset is earned on top (excluding fees).

Instead of publishing a lot articles, it may show a better conversion rate if we could use this funds to expand the media on Twitter especially with such type of media like flux did


[08/21/2022 9:28 PM] CW#0000
(re @Armeanio : *make some cuts? @seedubya @AndyLowe*) 
 
 All doable. Andy and I have been discussing making more shorts.

 Not sure we have the expertise in the community to make these types of vids. Definitely eye candy and engaging. Will look into costs to produce

Might be a bad comparison but the music industry is making a lot use of shorter songs, usually they get more attention. üòÇ


[08/21/2022 9:32 PM] CW#0000
Yeah, tiktok has a big influence here. Short, engaging content. Prob is people straight on to the next clip (on that platform). Usually longer engagement on twitter/others

(re @seedubya : *Not sure we have the expertise in the community to make these types of vids. Definitely eye candy and engaging. Will look into costs to produce*) 
 
 Sure, might be worth to cut fundings on different type of media. Then you could track the conversion and see what works better. 

Personally I'm not a fan of long articles on different platforms, since there are way too much projects doing the same stuff. However these type of media is eye catching, and showing way better conversion. 

What I would suggest is, give it a try and look what works out better.


[08/21/2022 9:33 PM] Tefcek21#0000
Are there tracked links for all media that the Ergo foundation is doing regarding paid media?


[08/21/2022 9:34 PM] CW#0000
Not aware we have paid media outside of our blog articles and some media releases


[08/21/2022 9:34 PM] Tefcek21#0000
(re @Tefcek21 : *Are there tracked links for all media that the Ergo foundation is doing regarding paid media?*) 
 
 If not, I can share something that we make use of with ErgoPad. It's nothing special but it's helping iut.

 Diversity of media is important. People consume in different ways, some love to read, others watch videos, some neither and want a quick hit. 

We have to cater for all, work in progress

(re @seedubya : *Diversity of media is important. People consume in different ways, some love to read, others watch videos, some neither and want a quick hit.

 Sure, however if the conversion is way lower than other type of media, we should consider focusing more on what is showing a better conversion than the other one. I'm not saying to cut all articles, but lowering it and give other type of media a chance.


[08/21/2022 9:40 PM] CW#0000
Yep for sure, just need the resources, expertise to create certain types

(re @AndyLowe : *this poll is biased because it was only conducted on twitter. it should be expected that the results show twitter as the top answer*) 
 
 Thats true, thats why I suggested to use tracked links, and tools for the conversion.

[08/21/2022 11:08 PM] AndyLowe#0000
I am all in favour of making a concise explainer video, but I need help to refine the script and figure out exactly what the message is. in the case of flux, it seems they have a clear idea of how they want to pitch themselves


[08/21/2022 11:09 PM] AndyLowe#0000
btw - has anyone ever heard or or used the phrase 'smarter contracts'?


[08/21/2022 11:09 PM] AndyLowe#0000
i think its a nice way to grab peoples attention and its basically saying - our smart contracts are better


[08/21/2022 11:10 PM] AndyLowe#0000
could be used as a marketing tool


[08/21/2022 11:14 PM] Tefcek21#0000
For each short video pick a question to answer, and let other peoples double check. 

1. What makes Ergo unique / What differentiate Ergo from other blockchains? 

2. Why should I mine Ergo? / How do I mine Ergo? 

3. Why is there no leading team behind Ergo? How does it work? 

4. What is the Ergo mixer, and what's the purpose of it? 

5. How can I start building on Ergo / How can I connect to other Developers? 

6. Is Ergo a secure blockchain, if so why? 

7. How is Ergo powering the future of finance?


[08/21/2022 11:15 PM] Tefcek21#0000
Explaining in short videos around 1 minute, with some visuals such as a Diashow. Free marketing that can be used everywhere: Twitter, Reddit, Tiktok, Instagram or so.


[08/21/2022 11:18 PM] AndyLowe#0000
question 1 for example can not be summarised into a 1 minute video imo


[08/21/2022 11:19 PM] Tefcek21#0000
(re @AndyLowe : *question 1 for example can not be summarised into a 1 minute video imo*) 
 
 It's not possible for sure. Just give the most important points and link a blog article or so. 

If you want attract more people, you can't start talking about too complex things. Give them those points, what makes them excited and the rest can be found in the article.


[08/21/2022 11:20 PM] Tefcek21#0000
If you start talking about everything in detail, people or better said the average person gets bored. Thats how advertising works.


[08/21/2022 11:24 PM] Tefcek21#0000
These are just personal thoughts btw., I might be wrong but this seems like a good way to me. Or better said the best way for a mass adaption and to reach out to the average user

(re @Tefcek21 : *These are just personal thoughts btw., I might be wrong but this seems like a good way to me. Or better said the best way for a mass adaption and to reach out to the average user*) 
 
 There is another question about who is the target audience, as far as I know there are three audiences for Ergo, so there isnt just one average user to try to appeal to. There are holders, developers, and miners. each group is looking for different things and needs it in completely different levels of detail

 Well, you can decide the target audience for each video, it's up to you. If you want to talk about technical things, which takes more time to explain make longer videos on youtube. If you want to reach out to the average user, use shorter videos.

Hi all, have to provide a text update this week. Little one has been sick, just got back from hospital. Hopefully on the mend now but still on caring duty.

Past few days have been limited as will maybe next 1-2 days due to the above. 

Videos recorded and released
2 x HashItOut. State of NFTs and TC fallout
2 x Dark Cave Miners live streams. Decentralization in PoW mining and Sigmavere/dApp highlight today.
2 x weekly dev updates
1 x ergo wallet installation run through
1 x mixer intro and run through

Recorded 
Short ErgoPOS interview, need to clean up a little. The language barrier is a little tough

Miner interview with 60gh farm. Also needs cleaning up, the chap was quite erratic

Twitter
Just the usual going on. Have seen a nice uptick in engagement in CT as you might have noticed. Good to see the ergonauts energized again.

I've jumped into the Ethermine discord a couple of times to help with wallet recommendations and OCs. I will make an effort for other pools also

Working on some documentation, hopefully, have this finished up shortly and catching up on the discussions I have missed over the previous couple of days.

I‚Äôm also in discussion with them for marketing collab


[08/24/2022 4:46 PM] root7Z#0000
*Ergonauts Biweekly 24 August 2022

Angie:
*- First focus was on Hackathon development. We have the document of concept promotion and the whole idea. All tasks are mentioned in the document. We discussed also with Noah about some ideas and topics.
- Better to start with our partners for hackathon. Firstly Djed Alliance, they had some ideas, Bruno will provide some NFT prizes. We discussed some main concepts about specialization tracks. It will be easier for judgement process
- Another is Flux and they supported this, I don't know what are their thoughts on the ideas. 
- Main bottleneck is the topic 
- Due to ETH Merge September from Noah‚Äôs point of view, we should make the event early in September but we don't have time for promotion. So I propose start the promotion soon for making the event in October.
- So the topic is still not clear; thinking Djed and Flux for specialization. I hope that we get the common ground today. We talked with Bruno yesterday but it's not clear what topic we will do. This topic is needed to prepare content better 
- Apart from promotion we have all documents ready, Ollie put advertisement messages into these groups. Due to the ETH merge, it's better to mix advertisements together.So this is the main focus.
- We have partnerships with Flux and Zelcore. We are preparing announcement and some extra marketing activities like AMA sessions. I'm waiting for them to provide me some details so we're in touch.
- For Ethereum merge we need to run another campaign. To see how to recruit ETH miners. Not only Twitter campaign but also with media, social media, and other platforms: I have a question; if we are able to buy a web subscription for a couple of months that we can also share with ErgoDEX. I usually used this with my personal email and corporate email but I don't have any more access. It's an analytical platform about our competitors and traffic and which websites to put ou <clipped message>

update on Koinly:

Hi Noah,
We're aiming to launch this integration before the end of the year which means we'll probably start working on it actively around October.
For now, we've done the research and the planning so there won't be much happening until the devs start working on it


[08/24/2022 6:04 PM] filippounits#0000

 There is a Brooklyn-based Ergonaut called Garry Golden (@garrygolden on twitter) who is trying to organize a NY Ergo meetup. I imagine he must know more New Yorkers that are into Ergo than any of us because of it.
I messaged him asking him to tell me more about  it and will report back.
It might take a minute though, he is a normal person who tweets sporadically, not like me üòÇ
I will let you know what he says

Is EIP 28 close to being approved?


[08/27/2022 7:38 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
It is completely done this way in wallet app and could be approved when it is me. But I think it is implemented differently in nautilus, unfortunately so might be discussions needed.
You already implemented it IIRC? Comments of actual using developers would be appreciated.


[08/27/2022 8:05 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
Yes we have it implemented for your wallet and nautilus


[08/27/2022 8:05 AM] marty_ergopad#0000

@abhishekp7 @trappert did you have any feedback about ergoauth implementation? Maybe this is the best place to discuss


[08/27/2022 8:08 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
@MrStahlfelge we are ready to launch alpha testing for our web2 implementation of Paideia using 100% ergoauth with no username/password stuff. Users are authenticated then can engage in discussion based on the Dao tokens they hold.

I think the second approval should come from someone with good security knowledge like @mhs_sam - and I think nautilus does not follow the EIP

There is a spectrum of being completely open, using correct channels, and being silenced. The correct channels are mostly there and being used. Openess is there.

The attempted silencing by Charles wrt @adamKDean @amw7 and @SebastienGllmt is an issue.

you can only withdraw erg on coinex, and it is the only wallet available officially on both app stores.

viawallet burns tokens, but there are no tokens available to buy on coinex - only erg.

unrelated question: for babel fees... I know the ergo mobile wallet was implementing on test net... any updated info on that? I'm trying to explain Ergo's babel fees from Nitro147 Github page... would like to end with any implementation info. It's a bit trickier than how cardano did it.


[09/01/2022 7:34 PM] anon_br#0000
(re @jameskever : *unrelated question: for babel fees... I know the ergo mobile wallet was implementing on test net... any updated info on that? I'm trying to explain Ergo's babel fees from Nitro147 Github page... would like to end with any implementation info. It's a bit trickier than how cardano did it.*) 
 
 Actually, Nautilus is doing that, in both networks fees are paid in native tokens (ada and erg), the difference on Ergo is that a swap is done under the hood using a babel box.

So differently than than Cardano, on Ergo we need to have liquidity pools for babel fees (something very close to a dex pool), the advantage of it is that you don't need to wait for someone to accept your tokens and pay the fee for you.


[09/01/2022 7:36 PM] jameskever#0000
is it wrong to refer to the utxo as having a piggy bank of a babel token the user can decide to buy from or not (based on price parameters in the utxo)?


[09/01/2022 7:39 PM] anon_br#0000
(re @jameskever : *is it wrong to refer to the utxo as having a piggy bank of a babel token the user can decide to buy from or not (based on price parameters in the utxo)?*) 
 
 It's a good analogy, but the person that is sending the transaction actually sells babel tokens for erg


[09/01/2022 7:39 PM] anon_br#0000
You buy erg to pay the miner fee


[09/01/2022 7:41 PM] jameskever#0000
so the utxo has a piggy bank of erg... and depending on parameter ratio, the transactor can trade babel fees (per defined ratio) for erg, used to pay the tx


[09/01/2022 7:42 PM] jameskever#0000
oi my brain hurts lol


[09/01/2022 7:42 PM] Armeanio#0000
I think one of the benefits to ergos model is bots can be used to minimize slippage and also profit.


[09/01/2022 7:42 PM] jameskever#0000
that's a juicy detail that needs to get in there


[09/01/2022 7:43 PM] Armeanio#0000
If babel box prices are different from the dex price there is profit motive involved. So an economic incentive to arbitrage using bots.


[09/01/2022 7:44 PM] anon_br#0000
(re @jameskever : *so the utxo has a piggy bank of erg... and depending on parameter ratio, the transactor can trade babel fees (per defined ratio) for erg, used to pay the tx*)

[09/04/2022 11:32 PM] Tefcek21#0000
If through the support service, mostly you have one person who is usually watching about the token / coin. In our case it was a guy named Suaraz, and I have been talking all the time to him instead of always to another person, and it was helpful.

 If so would be cool if someone could confirm, Dan and me were looking on different ways to get spectrum on CMC with the price tracking, so we can have price charts for all the native tokens. Maybe we can find a way for Ergo too, while doing this.

 that's about 22M 3060 GPUs, isn't it?

3060 is 40Mhs for eth, 115 Mhs for erg

 asic will go to ETC mostly (idk if any other options), so it would be non profitable for GPU miners to go there, at least in the begining. 
with high price of elec in current world, RVN is off the table for lots of them.

[09/06/2022 10:35 PM] CW#0000
Ive been in various mining discords and sub reddits the last few weeks and tons of chatter on switching to Ergo. Efficiency is the hot topic, need significant price appreciation for profitability to be worth while, especially where running costs are high

They need more than anyone else a high market cap coin - but do they have an influence on it? Did they contribute to the price appreciation of Ethereum or did they just profit from it?


[09/06/2022 10:41 PM] mhs_sam#0000
I used to mine RVN at launch, at the very first two weeks I had roughly around 30% of its net hr. In this two weeks (solo) and the next two weeks after that (pooled), I gained more than one year of my regular profit. 
however, I abondanded it quickly since I lost 10 1080ti in a month and the heat was crazy, and never touched it again.
Miners know it is bad for their GPUs.

I was looking for days for the wallets and snapshots but didn't find them yet.


[09/06/2022 10:43 PM] CW#0000
Id say a driving force to Eth growth. Miners are users, devs, community members. Incentive for them is to attract users, returns are tx fees, block rewards and what not. often cop flak and seen as just extracting value but they add a heap to ecosystems outside of security alone

 yeah, but price matters. 
I had 4x 64btu AC and the GPU fans was 100%. Also 6 gpus in a case with 6 extra fans. however, in not a cold region tbh.

by this setup, it was not feasible to use the full power of cards. So, I had to reduce the power and reduce the gains. at the end, I decided to abandon it. 

I'm not saying that no one will mine it, but it's obviously not your best option as a miner.

 high prices of elec nowadays is one of the best chances for Ergo


[09/06/2022 10:51 PM] mhs_sam#0000
another interesting thing to me is that 3000 series are better for ergo and 2000 series are better for flux. by chance, miners mostly use 3000 series over 2000. Actually, 2000 series are not as popular as 1000 and 3000 ones. Again, a good thing for ergo


[09/06/2022 10:52 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
They must have a very large war chest after so many years of mining ETH. It could well be oriented to first raise the price of Ergo by just buying it massively, while mining without selling, and only start disposing of the mined coins once the price is at a level equivalent to current Ethereum's price. I don't see any other possible strategy viable in the long term.


[09/06/2022 10:53 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
You can't mine for a long time with so many GPU's an Ergo at 5$.


[09/06/2022 10:55 PM] CW#0000

 2070 are apparently beasts on flux. 30 series like you said in ergo are lovely. Then there will always be the flavour of the day/week regarding profitability


[09/06/2022 10:55 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
Unless they managed the life duration of their GPUs by having mostly old GPUs and are ready to throw everything away, they have a strong incentive to have a real alternative to ETH.


[09/06/2022 10:56 PM] CW#0000
(re @upwindstrategy : *You can't mine for a long time with so many GPU's an Ergo at 5$.*) 
 
 Eth is giving miners about $25m a day in rewards. All the pow chains combined outside of Eth is lucky to come to $1m.


[09/06/2022 10:57 PM] mhs_sam#0000
most non-eth miners are selling only. so they mine and sell immediately. 
in large farms, I saw some limited number of rigs dedicated to adventurous mining of very low cap coins, in order to hoard and bet on their price explosion. 
Things are somehow different with eth. Miners usually hold a portion of mined coins.

due to very aggressive reduce of erg emission in the next 4 years, we should emphasize on that. So, the best strategy for an Erg miner would be *buy now* and start mining- sell regularly.
but most of the newcomers might be ignorant about erg emission and its impact. Might be good if we can educate them about it.

[09/06/2022 10:59 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
Unless we come with some algo that uses almost no electricity until then, they'll need an expensive Ergo, and if they have the money to move the price of a coin, seriously, it's so easy for them regarding their wealth, it's mind blowing.

 cannot say that. I used to have both BTC miner and GPUs. Lots of miner are mixed miner, lots of them only on asic or gpu.


[09/06/2022 11:23 PM] CW#0000
(re @upwindstrategy : *Interesting. Do the mining farms have a diversified portfolio of mining machines? (ASIC vs GPUs?)*) 
 
 Asics are extremely efficient in comparison to gpus but along with that comes cost (extremely expensive) and availability. In some/most instances it can be more profitable for manufactures to mine and not sell them. 

Then you have the major players getting first dibs.

Any business though prob good to have a little diversification but asics on eth would have been extremely profitable from late 2020 but now limited in what they can do. Some expensive paper weights?

Imagine for some reason Twitter is no longer a feasible platform for Cardano, then as soon as @mercurychatio implement ADA handles I‚Äôd in theory be able to find key people in the community on here instantly

What are your roadmap of UI improvements? 
UI/UX of the only mobile wallet is an important point in adoption of Ergo. We have a good UI/UX designer who worked on ErgoDEX and then Spectrum + we have a complete design system of ErgoDEX which is very friendly to Ergo branding (orange/black/white). I thought we can adapt it for Terminus. The question is will you be ready to implement this design in code?

 the UI layer of iOS is really hard to work with, no real preview, recompile and restart needed for every UI change, buggy with lots of workarounds described on stackoverflow. not fun to work with and really eats a lot of time.
what can be done without problems is easy improvements regarding colors, margins, some shapes. most UI designers that sent suggestions seem to only know CSS where nearly everything is possible so their suggestions were not really applicable for UIKit since some of the elements on iOS are not only UI but also UI behaviour control. best is to let someone do the task who is experienced with UIKit already and does not want to reinvent the wheel but just spice up the existing controls


[09/07/2022 3:05 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
so, I have no roadmap for UI changes. until the release we had only around 6k users on ios. let's see how it changes now.

@MrStahlfelge 
The UX/UI is ok for true ergo believers but not enough for mass adoption
Spectrum team can allocate resources and build design library and full set of UX/UI mockups for iOS and Android mobile wallets.
It would be cool if you have time to integrate spectrum swap form to the wallet, like 1inch did (see screen shot).
If you are interested we can discuss it.

We launched the new payout system on Ergo pools. It allows you to mine Ergo and receive the payouts in BTC!

You just need to set the BTC wallet address in your mining software if you want to get the payouts in BTC.

(re @AndyLowe : *so selling erg on an exchange then*) 
 
 Yeah in a sense.  Was just discussing with my team.  Will definitely be helpful for miners because it makes liquidation a lot easier with BTC since you can pretty much liquidate anywhere.  The downfall perpetual sell pressure on erg for the miners using it.


[09/07/2022 10:05 PM] AndyLowe#0000

Would it be possible to set 2 or more different addresses with each its own royalties when creating an NFT? 
I think that this could open very interesting new use cases for NFTs.
And multiple royalty receivers at protocol level could incentivise much more collaboration.

(re @mhs_sam : *how being a flux parallel asset affect ergo? how it works?

 I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a flux/erg token that‚Äôs minted on ergo and given to miners who mine on flux as a parallel asset. This token can be used as an asset within the ergo ecosystem (LPs and such) or be swapped for flux or other flux tokens.


[09/11/2022 3:58 PM] mhs_sam#0000
I guess not. So you mean it's a totally different asset minted on ergo? what's the value of that?
They are saying they will send Ergo to their miners. That would be on flux or ergo chain, that's another question btw.
if it's another token, problem solved. 
if it's Erg, how?

@anon_br you may know?


[09/11/2022 4:02 PM] mhs_sam#0000
(re @MrStahlfelge : *You can swap in their app*) 
 
 I think swap is possible but it's another feature. I read somewhere that if you mine 100 flux for example, you will receive that plus 100 flux equivalet of parallel assets. idk if it's an automatic process or they have to swap.

 From what I understand it‚Äôs like @Arohbe said, we‚Äôll have a FLUX token on Ergo that can be swapped 1:1 per a native FLUX on their app, not sure about distribution though

Majority are extremely interested (prob say that with everyone) when they dive in a bit deeper. 

Their concern is the difficulty adjustment and that potentially being gamed. I.e huge influx of hash, speed up block time, they jump off once difficulty starts to adjust. Rinse and repeat


[09/11/2022 9:10 PM] mx#5165
yes, very impressive work during the whole show, well difficulty adjustment has its own paper and it is there for a reason, most quick adjustments are fine when you are a small chain, but the problems start when you are big


[09/11/2022 9:11 PM] mx#5165

 I think it will not happen, since we will not see a very huge wave after the merge. Not ergo, but even others like flux, rvn, etc.
Probably the EthPW will be the first station for miners and that's incredibly positive for us. Later, it'll fail and more miners will seek new homes. It's my hypothesis and if it happens, I guess we will not encounter Diff Adjustment issues.

Beside that, and if not true, I still bet on that not to happen.
By any chance if that happens the solution is easy but the decision is hard. We cannot do anything before it happens except a Hard Fork. If that happens however, we have to do the hardfork.

So, let's hope for it and if that happens we have no choice except HF. We can do the HF now, but we can wait and see, maybe HF is not necessary at all.

Just thinking loudly, don't take it seriously and do not shareüòÇ

 The price level influences the influx of hashrate to ergo. If erg price is enough high, the miners will quickly switch their hashrate to ergo. The current erg price cannot support more hashrates. Many miners are profit-seeking.


[09/12/2022 12:15 AM] AndyLowe#0000
miners are profit seeking, yet if hashrate goes up before price rise it indicates they are happy to mine at a loss and hold, so clearly they do not want to instantly sell at a loss. It's another form of increased demand.
The result is sell pressure from miners disappears, which allows price to rise, reaching equilibrium again.


[09/12/2022 12:16 AM] AndyLowe#0000
Hashrate would only rise before price if there was increased demand from miners, that they want to accumulate and hold erg


[09/12/2022 12:31 AM] kushti#0000
Briefly checked whattomine, likely not a huge influx we will see around the merge but lets see


[09/12/2022 12:35 AM] CW#0000
i was on a call with 20 off of the miner influencers yesterday, i think all mentioned theyre splitting majority of their hash between flux and ergo. i guess this could be considered retail mining with pretty big following base. 

The question is what will the big guys do

The biggest Ethereum mining pool, @ethermine_org, officially announced it will not be offering services to miners on the network once The Merge happens, and it won't be servicing any of the planned PoW forks either.

looks like through next 6-7 hours hash rate will be dropping slowly of eth and going in different places, maybe not so bad with the diff in the end


[09/15/2022 12:13 AM] kushti#0000
eth hashrate already slowly dropping , like minus 10-15 % in last 24 hrs to the moment


[09/15/2022 12:13 AM] kushti#0000
ASICs will stay till the merge likely

see how many really were on there


[09/15/2022 12:14 AM] kushti#0000

Higher hashrate means lower sell pressure in theory? As some miners do always sell and others hold, but the distribution is spread further

(re @NoahErgo : *New pool cool2mine just popped up with 2th*) 
 
 Now their pool is down.  I think alot of those are small pools messing with nice hash or individual miners. NiceHash has about 2th in their market.  Seen a couple pools spike up and down very quickly.


[09/15/2022 5:21 AM] filippounits#0000

We are forced to upgrade ERGO Pool data storage mechanism right now to improve the ERGO pool and website performance.

Unfortunately, we would be forced to erase the hashrate charts in the ERG mining pool.

The mining process, your rewards and payouts would not be affected anyhow

[09/15/2022 5:39 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Sure, they want the fees. But it doesn't matter for most users complaining about no listing.


[09/15/2022 5:39 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Refering to Kushti's argument above


[09/15/2022 5:40 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Anyone who sleeps on ergo because it's not on binance or coinbase will be the same people willing to dish out $50 per erg


[09/15/2022 5:40 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
They're the ones that got into eth when it was over $2k.


[09/15/2022 5:46 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
For me getting on gate.io at the time was a tremendous leap to make. I know it's ridiculous but I think I perhaps am the normiest of the ergonauts. It really feels foreign.
I think one of the considerations a lot of people may make include safety too. They equate the big exchanges with reliability. Like their funds won't be siphoned out by a hack.


[09/15/2022 5:46 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
Have you guys ever helped your mom with her email?


[09/15/2022 5:47 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
It's not *that* bad (for people who buy crypto) but it's not far off.

(re @Gstoiti : *Yeah, and liquidity doesn't matter for them. They just market buy without looking at the order book.*)

Good evening!

My name is Ivan ‚Äî I am a co-founder and editor-in-chief of the Jiwo.ru internet informational portal. We write about everything related to cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and metaverses.

We plan to write a review of your crypto coin in the upcoming material, and to revitalize the article, I came up with an idea to add some conversation and your commentaries. In this regard, I am writing to you with quite an interesting proposal. Would you be interested in a short interview, where I would ask one of your workers (or just one worker) a couple of questions concerning your project?

The interview will last under 5-10 minutes, so it will not take much of your time. Moreover, I may propose some kind of a written-form or voice-form interview via email or social networks, so the interviewee would just write or say a couple of sentences on each question in chat or through voice messages.

Tell me, please, what you think about the proposal and if you are ready for the cooperation. Thank you in advance!

Sincerely yours,
Ivan Krikunov

 On Twitter it'd make for a great follow up to yesterday's event


[09/16/2022 2:11 PM] koutelier#0000
Twitter is the best I believe but not all miners have twitter


[09/16/2022 2:11 PM] koutelier#0000
Why not YouTube and promote it in every platform?


[09/16/2022 2:11 PM] koutelier#0000
Or how Charles does twitter and YouTube at same time

[09/16/2022 2:14 PM] Frostyausty#0000

 Think this requires some technical maneuvering, probably some media platform


[09/16/2022 2:15 PM] Frostyausty#0000
(re @koutelier : *Twitter is the best I believe but not all miners have twitter*)

(re @glasgowm : *Don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve ever been able to do a Twitter one successfully*) 
 
 That was mainly due to technical issues though, people did jump in on the space iirc

r/cc pins AMAs from time to time, have you tried asking them if they'd be open to have an Ergo one?

(re @FoeniculumNFTs : *r/cc pins AMAs from time to time, have you tried asking them if they'd be open to have an Ergo one?*)

[09/16/2022 3:00 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @kushti_ru : *Maybe it is time to start buzz about upcoming emission reduction also*) 
 
 Reduce emission means miners will earn less?


[09/16/2022 3:01 PM] kushti#0000
Less ergs yes


[09/16/2022 3:01 PM] kushti#0000
Not necessarily less


[09/16/2022 3:01 PM] kushti#0000
Also depends on messaging btw


[09/16/2022 3:02 PM] kushti#0000

[09/16/2022 3:02 PM] koutelier#0000

 Yeah it only increased on the charts . Maybe they are miners looking for profits not the actual tech behind


[09/16/2022 3:03 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
And it is a good thing yes


[09/16/2022 3:03 PM] kushti#0000
You can update old ones with manifesto etc @seedubya @AngieHar


[09/16/2022 3:03 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Many new miners are doing market sell to BTC. It's killing erg price


[09/16/2022 3:03 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Lower emission is a great thing


[09/16/2022 3:03 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
It means fewer erg sold


[09/16/2022 3:04 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @marty_ergopad : *And it is a good thing yes*) 
 
 I am not familiar with mining . But the word less makes me think that less profit for them and I do know that they only care about profit

The Benefits of Building on Ergo

Ergo is no...

I get how it influences difficulty based on hash... with the difficulty jumping so much yesterday... it might be interesting to try and explain all this in a reader on Proof of Ergo.

 It was set at genesis, the difficulty adjustment algorithm attempts to keep it at 120s on average, works well during steady hashrate changes; but uses the linear least square method (an average) of the hash over the past eight epochs (8x1024 blocks). So each time the difficulty adjusts it‚Äôs taking an avg of the past 8 epochs; so sudden spikes or drops can take a long time to be fully reflected in difficulty.

Ergo already uses an epoch length of ~1.5 days (with normal block rate), compared to Bitcoin's two weeks. Having a quicker difficulty readjustment can lead to Timewarp attacks (amongst others - kushti mentioned drifting attacks today)


[09/16/2022 5:18 PM] jameskever#0000
Are time warp and drifting attacks similar but different?


[09/16/2022 5:20 PM] glasgowm#0000
may be the same thing actually - hadn‚Äôt looked into it yet

and this would be an attack using hash over time to influence difficulty... somehow affecting price... am I on the right track?

(re @jameskever : *and this would be an attack using hash over time to influence difficulty... somehow affecting price... am I on the right track?*) 
 
 No I think you‚Äôre referring to the coin hopping attack mentioned in the difficulty paper. That‚Äôs saying it helps prevent people manipulating the difficulty (jumping on with lots of hash to change it for gain) since it‚Äôs smoothed out (basically)


[09/16/2022 5:24 PM] glasgowm#0000
(re @jameskever : *and this would be an attack using hash over time to influence difficulty... somehow affecting price... am I on the right track?*) 
 
 Oh sorry a timewarp attack is similar actually üòÖ

> In simple terms, a timewarp attack occurs when a miner manages to put an incorrect timestamp into the blocks in order to reduce the subsequent mining difficulty.


[09/16/2022 5:25 PM] jameskever#0000
is this even possible on Ergo?


[09/16/2022 5:26 PM] jameskever#0000
the part I'm struggling with is "manages to put" How does the protocol allow a miner to "manage to put" an incorrect timestamp?

no problem, bit confusing as a few different things are grouped under it. Originally a ‚Äòoff-by-one‚Äô bug in bitcoin was called the Time Warp bug and was fixed

> Yes, that's true. In fact, that's how a reorg of any size is considered. However, that wasn't always the case. In the first version of Bitcoin, the client compared purely by chain height. In version 0.3.3 (released July 2010) we switched to comparing by chain work. Today, you can't pull off a timewarp attack without a majority of hashpower.

> However, let's say that you did have a majority of hashpower. What could you do with a time warp attack? You could mint an arbitrary number of blocks, and get more mining reward than you're entitled to. You could prevent the timestamp from advancing.

I more or less understand how an attacker (with less than 50%+1 of the hashing power) can artificially lower the block difficulty by messing with timestamps. I also understand how such an attacker ...

(re @NoahErgo : *Profitability taken a huge hit*) 
 
 Nothing is profitable at the moment unless you have no costs, still a lot of miners moving about so people leaving are being replaced by new miners and sustaining the hashrate a bit. 

The next adjustment difficulty should drop a little (hopefully) and give us our fourth epoch with high hash and start smoothing out a bit.


[09/17/2022 9:24 AM] glasgowm#0000
Big chunk of hash (670TH/s on Kaspa currently) moving about and cannabilising what‚Äôs most profitable. I imagine people will slowly drip off that, GPU miners giving up on ETC, people giving up on ETHw, etc.

What do you think about utilizing block reward divided by mining difficulty as a proxy of miners willingness to pay for one erg?

That would be like a stablecoin pegged to a commodity basket of energy and machines.

Currently that is not stable at all, but in the very long term it might stabilize, or?

The advantage is that it would be an oracle that is as secure as the chain itself.

- Mostly managing influx of miners, re. diff adjustment. Promoting community dicussions, push ergohack, huobi LPs, ecosystem projects.
- Wrote some threads on Twitter that got some good traction. Have another draft for miners giving them an overview of ecosystem and some useful links/threads.
- Set up a Regional-Outreach channel to try give the regional segments some structure/guidance.
- Updating pins, resources, ergonaut.space, ergodocs, website, etc. 
- Will make up Qs for Huobi AMA

*Ergonauts Biweekly 21 September 2022

Angie:
*- We launched the ErgoHack campaign, started with 7 press releases, and made 1 publication with a publishing service to support promotion.
- Listed ErgoHack in different free listing and going to add more. 
- Updated website on ErgoHack, now we‚Äôve 1 event with Alephium that will be on 29th of Sep on their Discord server.
- Communicated with Flux, discussing the educational materials from their side and their promotion stages.
- We have a list of articles on our roadmap, they are pending. Also 1 pitch deck presentation about the Ergo ecosystem is almost ready, working on the slides content.
- All focus is on promoting ErgoHack now, we need to find developers. Awareness is good on press releases. I will prepare a report on statistics. However not many applicants registered so we need to push the promotion. I'm thinking of additional platforms.

*Kushti:
*- In regards with marketing; organized and participated in 2 community chats recently regarding post-merge situation. Protocol development and Roadmap
- Need to do welcome video for ErgoHack, 
- Will participate in 2 AMA, with Huobi and Alephium community 
- Tweeting and participating in chats aside from development

Hey guys im right now editing an article based on Ergo's roadmap going forward. Trying to cover the complexities that is Dexy. Could anyone here let me know if what im saying here is accurate and if it isnt, provide me with some extra clarification? Here is the excerpt.


[09/21/2022 4:04 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Chepurnoy states that they try to avoid burning the stablecoin by first burning reserves in the case of a catastrophic event. The bank and liquidity pool charges fees to build its reserves up which allows the burning of reserves to take place rather than burning the stablecoin initially


[09/21/2022 4:05 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385

Been working on promoting and building NFT community. Started NFT Twitter community to have streamlined NFT feed for artists and community. At about 80 Ergonauts RN. Starting NFT Twitter spaces next week (likely Friday). Will try to have guest speakers attend to give updates to community. Will be updating Discord tomorrow with new artists/projects coming onboard. Hoping to have Sisyphus Collection completed in the next month and will proceed with getting the collage artwork done and preparing for airdrop to all SH and AH users. Always looking for new ideas to help bring awareness to the space, so if anyone has any, please let me know.

Would be good for some more reasoning/advantages to doing it the way Ergo does.


[09/22/2022 10:34 AM] glasgowm#0000
Found this from kushti but not much else on the topic 

> Everything in Ergo is explicit, no special coinbase transactions etc, thus all the coins issued before the genesis block but locked with emission and treasury contracts (as specified in the whitepaper).


> There are no special transactions or outputs in Ergo, no money created out of thin air, and Erg tokens can not disappear. Thus emission is done via a contract living from the pre-genesis state. This contract sets concrete requirements for a spending transaction (2 outputs, 1 is for emission contract, second is for the miner, proper scripts and amounts for both etc).


[09/22/2022 10:43 AM] eilemust#0000
Then I found a specific percent of that supply of native assets was preallocated to fund an ecosystem.

All this while claiming to be a Proof of Work chain with no premine & no preallocation of assets.

That blew my mind. I only popped in for a less than a day to try help out.

How can things published in the whitepaper before the mainnet launch be a secret? Yes, ERGs are locked up in contracts, unlike Bitcoin and its forks which do not have expressive contracts, and so emission hardcoded in client code (which is worse for many reasons, e.g. RVN fork)
Twitter


[09/22/2022 11:30 AM] kushti#0000
Rvn had a hard fork because of a bug in emission code, which was exploited and so many extra rvns reached exchanges before the fork

just to be sure, Vasil is bringing these 5 items to Cardano. All of them already available on ergo, right?

also, Vasil brings Diffusion pipelining. I'm not sure about it's equivalent in ergo. However, I guess it's not necessary due to our 2 mins block time. Not sure here.

Having emission stated explicitly in a contract is helping with making emission logic observable, cleaner and testable, which, in turn allows to avoid emission bugs like ones happened in Bitcoin and Ravencoin https://t.co/8Ii8e39sBe

Registration for the upcoming #ErgoHack is still open! 

Great opportunity for #developers & #miners to submit ideas/proposals around #mining & #minting.

Exciting time to be building on #Ergo & to be a part of the #Ergonaut community.

 I have 25% going by the diff adjust calculator, do you have 35% forecast? 

Would 16PH difficulty with 30TH network hash be 6-8 min block time? (4.5 to 5.5 day next epoch)

It's hard to say how miners will react at time of adjustment. Some saying will try to spike it again, others may have to turn off due to running costs (have kept hash on just to get through this epoch) and at the mercy of time and markets

Have been keeping, and pushing for open dialogue around the diff adjustment subject.

 it is very possible the new difficulty code prediction isnt perfect, we will see in a few hours I guess :) I have noticed it jumping around a bit which shouldnt really happen this far into the epoch, maybe my "time remaining in epoch" calculation is a bit off


[09/25/2022 1:36 PM] CW#0000
Yeah, we have see the hashrate between 30-38, been constantly monitoring to see when the next epoch will tick over and have solid numbers. Looking likely to occur 5-7am for me

Thanks for looking at that code btw mate


[09/25/2022 1:47 PM] LuivatraEP#0000

From Flux discord today:

‚Äúwe will not be enabling swap on Erg till the difficulty issues on Ergo are fixed, they are busting ass now to fix the issue. Opening swap now would flood there mempool and be a real mess.

They are referring to the problems that a submitted transaction is not propagated to all nodes and is therefore not shown in explorer.


[09/26/2022 9:43 AM] kushti#0000
This could be the case during normal block times as well, since 4.0.42 release, the node is limiting incoming unconfirmed transactions per block based on their execution cost.


[09/26/2022 10:01 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
sure, but with two minute block times it is barely noticeable and evens out very fast.


[09/26/2022 12:40 PM] mx#5165
slow times in cryptocurrency are the best to try to improve things, hopers will possibly join mining in 4-5 epochs, this time should be enough to prepare things, when you are accumulating you are kicking out all competition if possible, top hashes can reject HF as well, there was some NiPoPoW fix to do in HF if i remember right


[09/26/2022 12:46 PM] mx#5165
even if HF passes let`s say this week, it will only speed up reaching the bottoms of everything

They support HF if miners will vote for it

Yes it is above ^


[09/27/2022 11:08 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Ah so we don't need to take any action if its voted for, we will automatically fork with the network


[09/27/2022 11:08 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Amazing kushti, nice work


[09/27/2022 11:09 PM] NoahErgo#0000
as long as you are on newest release so make sure you update and encourage others to as well


[09/27/2022 11:09 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
I felt the diff adjustment was too slow even before eth miners dumped on us. This is a great update. I hope it passes

(re @marty_ergopad : *Ah so we don't need to take any action if its voted for, we will automatically fork with the network*) 
 
 yes


[09/27/2022 11:09 PM] kushti#0000
Miners decide update or not basically


[09/27/2022 11:10 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
What is the criteria for a for vote?


[09/27/2022 11:10 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Certain hash? Or blocks submitted?


[09/27/2022 11:10 PM] koutelier#0000
This hard fork won‚Äôt bring any drawbacks or cons ?


[09/27/2022 11:10 PM] Armeanio#0000
Block based voting


[09/27/2022 11:12 PM] kushti#0000
(re @marty_ergopad : *Certain hash? Or blocks submitted?*) 
 
 Blocks with votes over some period


[09/27/2022 11:13 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Is there a way to get a list of how mining pools are voting? We can encourage miners to support them

I saw it was something like 250 votes needed?

is one block = one vote?

Depends on what is being changed


[09/28/2022 12:58 AM] NoahErgo#4349
Hard fork just means a breaking change that is not backward compatible in the chain

{Reactions}

[09/28/2022 1:08 AM] filippounits#0000
and in the other hand, a Soft Fork is backward compatible in the chain and do not require an update of the older versions to the last one (although it would be better to always stay up to date)


[09/28/2022 1:16 AM] NoahErgo#0000

[09/28/2022 3:21 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
If we would have waited for original voting schedule it would have meant waiting way too long to get block times stabilized, with this we should speed up the process while still honoring a supermajority governance vote.                                                                                                                                           EIP-37 could be adjusted further or even replaced but that will have to wait until we get network back to running at close to normal block production rate

 so we have around 700 views of the ergohack website 
224 views of the application form 
and 11 submissions including Jennie 
so the conversion rate is 4,9% this time which is quite low comparing to the ergohack fest 

any external factors could also influence this, maybe timimg was chosen not right, maybe overall, need to research because the awareness at the average level due to views within a specific period


[09/28/2022 12:05 PM] LuivatraEP#0000
maybe due to bear market fatigue, it's a shame all we got out of the merge was short sighted miners and no (or few) devs

 It‚Äôs a not for profit magazine inside of a district (doork east) of the Ape Society, the NFT project on Cardano of which I‚Äôm the #1 holder. All work done on it by everyone is pro bono. I doubt that any NFT project on ETH has anything like that.

thank you


[09/30/2022 6:46 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
They should default it to yes


[09/30/2022 6:46 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
Unless the miner intends on it being a no


[09/30/2022 7:00 AM] LuivatraEP#0000
The latest version defaults to yes.


[09/30/2022 7:19 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
How does it work with getblok? Each miner sets their own vote manually?


[09/30/2022 7:21 AM] LuivatraEP#0000
Miners get gov tokens according to how much they have mined and send it into a contract before a deadline to indicate yes or no


[09/30/2022 7:23 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
So they will be voting no on all their blocks until the miners send in their votes, so does that change past blocks somehow?


[09/30/2022 7:27 AM] NoahErgo#0000
No it does not


[09/30/2022 7:33 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
Sorry, I don't get it


[09/30/2022 7:33 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
If the vote is cast when the block is mined, how do they later cast a vote?


[09/30/2022 7:36 AM] LuivatraEP#0000
The proposal is passed when 90% are for. The proposal is turned down if it isnt passed before block 9xx.xxx


[09/30/2022 7:37 AM] LuivatraEP#0000
People seem to panic for no reason


[09/30/2022 7:39 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
I just don't understand how getblok passes votes. And once the proposal passes, doesn't it automatically HF at that moment?


[09/30/2022 7:41 AM] LuivatraEP#0000
If more than 50% of getblok miners vote yes by getbloks deadline they will switch to voting yes


[09/30/2022 7:53 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
Until then, only no?


[09/30/2022 7:53 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
So because the vote went early, getblok wasnt ready it sounds like. Do you know their deadline?


[09/30/2022 8:15 AM] Gstoiti#0000
If everyone else votes yes, can they block the hardfork?


[09/30/2022 8:18 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
90% will pass it


[09/30/2022 8:19 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
If getblok is responsible for more than 10% of the votes, all of which are no, then it will not pass at that time.


[09/30/2022 8:19 AM] LuivatraEP#0000
Correct

That's me. I ran the dust-collecting script once two days ago because my oracle ground to a halt. That run generated a couple of hundred txs. I've never run that operation again after that. I'd happily remove my txs from the mempool, but I'm not sure it's possible. I'm looking into it now.

Ok thank you!

Shouldn't the network be able to handle these type of transactions without it affecting other users


[09/30/2022 11:12 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
It seems like an easy and cheap way to attack the network if you can just submit big transactions and it prevents others from submitting successfully


[09/30/2022 12:05 PM] AndyLowe#0000
But is there any incentive to do that


[09/30/2022 12:08 PM] glasgowm#0000
(re @marty_ergopad : *Shouldn't the network be able to handle these type of transactions without it affecting other users*) 
 
 Network doesn‚Äôt usually have 10m blocks heh. There‚Äôs also issues going on with kucoin and described issues may be specific to explorer front-end/unrelated rather than due to the network

(re @marty_ergopad : *It seems like an easy and cheap way to attack the network if you can just submit big transactions and it prevents others from submitting successfully*) 
 
 Big tx should pay more to get included. You can submit big txs to occupy pools just but in case of pool being overfull big txs will be replaced with ones paying more per byte or execution unit.


[09/30/2022 12:24 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @marty_ergopad : *So because the vote went early, getblok wasnt ready it sounds like. Do you know their deadline?*) 
 
 We planned around the initial voting window and then it changed.   Unfortunately the contract was written to finalize our vote by block 844625.   The contract is also built to ensure we place the correct vote otherwise it prohibits the pool from finding blocks.   So we‚Äôre kind of stuck and why we were not thrilled with the change last minute.

(re @kushti_ru : *Big tx should pay more to get included. You can submit big txs to occupy pools just but in case of pool being overfull big txs will be replaced with ones paying more per byte or execution unit.*) 
 
 The current apis to get recommended tx fee doesn't seem to work well. Promising fast execution times for 0.001 right now.
Additionally, light wallets can't predict the tx size before actually building the tx.

[09/30/2022 12:35 PM] kushti#0000
I did not check apis, knizhnik built them do ask him if estimations are not working well. But I guess for small tx 0.001 is enough now, small txs paying this fee are included quickly


[09/30/2022 12:38 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Just wanted to explain that for end users it is not possible to set a good fee right now. We still have work to do here


[09/30/2022 12:38 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I was aware of that but it did not seem important until 10 days ago


[09/30/2022 12:40 PM] kushti#0000
(re @MrStahlfelge : *Just wanted to explain that for end users it is not possible to set a good fee right now. We still have work to do here*) 
 
 What is the issue?


[09/30/2022 12:42 PM] kushti#0000
We had bigger issues when gate.io collected its dust with high fee txs


[09/30/2022 12:49 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I remember that incident, I integrated the API afterwards. So I don't know what it predicted at that time.
Problem is also how the API is designed. It expects a byte size for the estimation. I don't know the byte size of a usual transaction, and it is not clearly documented if it is the size of the serialized tx or something else. It doesn't make sense to use the size of a serialized tx because costing will take other stuff into account.
Additionally, building the tx before the user sets the fee has some downsides right now because we are lacking an API to get unspent boxes by address. Waiting for this to get resolved before I can take a look at the prediction.


[09/30/2022 1:00 PM] kushti#0000
Back then txs were sorted by fee per byte in the mempool, now by default during the startup sorting order is chosen randomly, whether fee per byte or fee per cost unit


[09/30/2022 1:00 PM] kushti#0000
But if no size what could be an input for fee estimation?


[09/30/2022 1:09 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I don't know the inner workings of costing. For normal p2pk tx the amount of input boxes seem to make the difference


[09/30/2022 1:34 PM] kushti#0000
Number of outputs is more important, as an output is bigger usually than an input for p2pk case


[09/30/2022 1:35 PM] kushti#0000
But then you can estimate tx size if you know number of inputs and outputs


[09/30/2022 1:37 PM] anon_br#0000
They can also be serialized individually, should be a really close estimation


[09/30/2022 2:19 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
is it just the byte size of the serialized box?


[09/30/2022 2:27 PM] kushti#0000
Tx conrains only inputs and outputs. For p2p input size is fixed. For p2pk output, depends on number of tokens included only


[09/30/2022 2:37 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
but what exactly is the size? I can calc with number of inputs and number of outputs. for a usual wallet app transaction, outputs are three - the interesting variability is in the inputs. so what to use as the constant to multiply the number of inputs with?


[09/30/2022 3:41 PM] NoahErgo#0000
@Armeanio @kushti_ru need ergohack video by tomorrow so andy has time to edit sunday before kickoff monday. Kushti i know you are a bit sick so if you arent able to do this plz let me know so we can find alternative solution

(re @MrStahlfelge : *but what exactly is the size? I can calc with number of inputs and number of outputs. for a usual wallet app transaction, outputs are three - the interesting variability is in the inputs. so what to use as the constant to multiply the number of inputs with?*) 
 
 Will check, but an input for p2pk is just about sig which is 64 bytes, output id, so 32 bytes, and few more extra bytes


[09/30/2022 4:12 PM] kushti#0000
So about 100 bytes


[09/30/2022 4:15 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Currently I use a constant of 1000 for the API request. This is good for a few inputs but not enough for a lot of input boxes. 
Anyway, API returns negative numbers as wait time right now.


[09/30/2022 4:18 PM] anon_br#0000
Why not serialize the transaction and get the precise size in bytes?


[09/30/2022 4:18 PM] anon_br#0000
Or at least serialize inputs and outputs individually, fee box can be a constant in most cases I guess


[09/30/2022 4:22 PM] NoahErgo#0000
(re @kushti_ru : *I am still sick yes*) 
 
 I will sort out. Thanks, hope you feel better soon üôè

(re @anon_br : *Or at least serialize inputs and outputs individually, fee box can be a constant in most cases I guess*) 
 
 yes, I can do that. but right now the endpoint returns negative waiting times, so there is not much sense in optimizing the request http://159.65.11.55:9053/transactions/waitTime?fee=1000000&txSize=100


[09/30/2022 4:32 PM] justin1000#0000

@DanielTetsuyama here‚Äôs a discussion following the problem we had as we had to mint every frame separately yesterday at the ape society (i had to do 284  separate mints one by one!!),  what is learned there (once it reaches IOHK, which seems very difficult to achieve) should be also shared with ergo (and vice versa) from a perpsective of foreseeing future needs for NFTs that will make us stand out from the crowd once we have mass adoption arriving, as eUTXO probably shares a lot of common problems regarding the implementation of NFT standards, it would be nice to see even harmonisation of ideas, cross learning, and in the longer run, we would even find use cases for Ergo‚Äôs PoW capabilities that could be used by Cardano‚Äôs NFTs as moving NFTs accross different blockchains is imminent. For example smart NFTs requiring PoW minted on Ergo and ported on Cardano would maybe require a standard of recognition of these special cryptographic proofs.

(re @marty_ergopad : *What is going on with mempool? still transactions from the 28th. I can't submit new transactions even with a node*) 
 
 why can't submit ? Even if your txs are there, the node is supporting chaining in the mempool

[10/03/2022 12:07 AM] mhs_sam#0000
(re @marty_ergopad : *It says the tx is successful but never makes it to mempool*) 
 
 mempool is full, so cannot be in mempool immediately. It takes at least one block to be mined, then it will appear in the mempool. Probably it's too late to be in that block's candidate so it will be mined in the next block. So about 3 blocks of waiting. If you resend the tx during this period probably you'll end up with more waiting and no success.

 The node said it was a success, and provided a link. When I checked that explorer link, the transaction didn't enter mempool at any time. I tested a few transactions a few separate times this morning. I can check to see if this is still an issue


[10/03/2022 12:34 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
(re @mhs_sam : *mempool is full, so cannot be in mempool immediately. It takes at least one block to be mined, then it will appear in the mempool. Probably it's too late to be in that block's candidate so it will be mined in the next block. So about 3 blocks of waiting. If you resend the tx during this period probably you'll end up with more waiting and no success.*) 
 
 So no expectation of seeing it on explorer at all until after a couple block confirmations?


[10/03/2022 12:35 AM] mhs_sam#0000
(re @marty_ergopad : *So no expectation of seeing it on explorer at all until after a couple block confirmations?*) 
 
 one block to be mined, then expect it. if not there, probably some other issue

(re @mhs_sam : *one block to be mined, then expect it. if not there, probably some other issue*) 
 
 As you said, it was all there, just not showing in mempool. Now I know. Something to consider adding to the wallet section if anyone ever has time is a local mempool so you know what transactions are waiting. Until now I thought it would always show up on explorer. 

I was doing 1 erg miner fees to try to get it through, so donated at least 6 erg to miners by accident. They deserve it

I think he‚Äôs talking about a very specific idea that was done on other chains. I can ask him for more info on specific example and how it promoted the other chain. The idea is to promote Ergo mainly I think.

 Talking about apes, I stumbled across the guy who owns $demedici. Dm me for details. Just figured you might want it to be able to spread firstname@demedici subhandles to de' Medici family members once that's possible.


[10/03/2022 10:53 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
But of course it would be nice to also have an Ergo NFT on Cardano staked in a cabin, I could use the Alex NFT I commissioned from cryptofly777 for this. I‚Äôve also a color version of Pioneering Charles from her too, they could be together in the same cabin. Just an example. If you have other ideas why not, but the main question is if there‚Äôs interest and if yes, get the right person in contact with Cardman to continue the discussion outside of this chat.

 simplest way could be having an ape-specific bridge:
- ape society officially mints a bank of all 7001 apes on ergo. (officially may have different definitions here). 
- bank is a multisig wallet on ergo.
- apes to be sent to a multisig wallet on Cardano to be locked
- each locked ape on cardano, will be unlocked on Ergo
- for NFTs better to not burn/mint them, however possible.

I don't know if someone already had this idea, but what if our Oracle would be able to propose the service of making snapshots of token or NFT holders on others chains? A sort of dynamic Rosen-style bridge that could serve as enabling the use of more sophisticated solutions on Ergo, like for example the amazing DAO we have. Just brainstorming, in case that could be something interesting.

Hi guys, I think it is necessary to tweet our related twitter accounts like Ergo Foundation, Ergopad, ERG ‰∏≠Êñá @QingTranslator on Ergo_Platform new twitter accounts so as to increase their followers.


[10/06/2022 5:02 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
The Ergo_Platform account; it's not a good look
A few voices rising against it in the community (from people who are usually ok with anything) myself included
It looks cheap and scammy- an account from 2016 
Idk, I'd like to hear the reasoning behind this move

I think will be good in long run. Lots of rustled feathers but will bring lots of eyes to ergo. Important bit is that there is good transparency and messaging around it which i know there will be

I think the whole thing is hilarious, and like others said, any marketing is good marketing. I do understand it not feeling right to some people, though. Maybe we can use this account or the old one to gift to UTXO alliance or some other project that shares ethos....pay it forward in a way

[10/06/2022 5:51 PM] CW#0000
I think either, if Sigmanauts take control (of the ergoplatformorg account) they need to define their messaging/tone/voice for the account and anyone who has access should follow that

If you say it is the new account, and then change it after a couple weeks it could be bad, since many people will unfollow and have to follow again

I think we are at a key moment with that new Twitter account, if we simply try to post dozens of tweets I think a good amount of such tweets will just be like wtf when did I follow these guys *unfollow*.

I think we should try and make a post that encourage everyone to read what it says, I was thinking maybe link to one of the articles that talk about everything inside ERG's ecosystem and have kind of a quiz where they reply to questions after having read it and for the first 10 who reply properly and have RT'd get 50 ERGs ir something like that


[10/06/2022 7:00 PM] dann#0000

 I agree in principle except for the giveaway part
I haven't seen it done if not by influencers trying to gain followers


[10/06/2022 7:02 PM] dann#0000
Erg foundation has already done some quiz's with prize pool, It s not like a giveaway to gain new followers, It s more like a incentive for current followers to deep into Ergo

(re @ergomergoadargo : *Yep, the more that sinks in, the more this seems not so bad*) 
 
 I would estimate that audience exposure (per tweet) in many of the marketing packages I look at is 3-5k to buy exposure. (600k+)

Considering it is extended to all projects... I see it as an opportunity.


[10/06/2022 7:05 PM] Armeanio#0000

 A clear explanation of what happened is needed.

 I agree. It's a weird move, especially without any explanation. Looks like the account has been hacked and doesn't make Ergo look trustworthy.

Is it good marketing? I don't know. Tweets seem to get less response than on the old account. Imo the project tweets look a bit random and rushed. I think if one does something like this, there should be a very good marketing plan. That's just my perspective as a user without any marketing expertise.


[10/06/2022 9:35 PM] CW#0000
We are limited in what we can express in an official capacity regarding the hand over of the account. Without prompting, the community is expressing the reason as to how it was handed over

I'm definately not of the marketing mind, only supported requests over the years, and I want to suggest that the overall marketing strategy should be clear... Something like, educating and informing on the product, and the tactics are things like this that gain followers. If that is reasonable, then I would simply treat this with the strategy in mind and not address the method itself.

... Again, not a marketer, and I may be way off base

[10/07/2022 9:01 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
I'll be completely honest I think we're fooling ourselves if we think keeping the Twitter account long term will work, it's causing more harm than good. It's a CH move not a kushti move, and instead I suggest we keep it for 2 weeks and hammer out good informational tweets at end of two weeks say "here's this back anyone wanting more #Ergo see @ergoplatformorg".                                               

The brutally honest truth is, I think Charles should have returned the  account & handle a long time ago, if you leave a project you shouldn't hold a Twitter account hostage while you go and start a competitor. Childish and possibly illegal (definitely illegal in every regulated financial industry), IDK I'm not happy with what this does to Ergo's image


[10/07/2022 9:16 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I agree. I still did not follow/unfollow because my hopes are that this is a time limited campaign.

Forwarded from unknown: Just one question: Whose decision was it to migrate the ETC account and create Ergo_Platform on Twitter? I'd like to know who is responsible, and I'd like them to explain why this was a good idea here. Thanks.


[10/07/2022 11:35 AM] Gstoiti#0000
Imo we shouldn't blame whoever made this decision (some people like it, some don't), but it would be interesting to know what the reasoning was.


[10/07/2022 11:38 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I think the reasoning is obvious, but disputable. What's really important is that it is also obvious that our community is not satisfied how things are


[10/07/2022 11:39 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
the opinions are pretty diverging, and that is not good for the community as a whole. we have good reasoned reddit posts downvoted to hell. not good.


[10/07/2022 11:47 AM] Gstoiti#0000
Maybe that was a once in a lifetime event (like the merge üòÖ), but imo one should discuss who should decide about such important things. I guess it's no option to let the community vote on such decisions beforehand, but did foundation members vote/discuss? Were trustworthy community members (e.g. Sigmanauts like Noah) involved in the discussion? Why has the Ergo platform account been replaced and not the Ergo foundation account? What's the difference between those two accounts and are they run by the same people?


[10/07/2022 12:03 PM] glasgowm#0000
Was discussed in the foundation chat, FUD was expected but figured it was too good of an opportunity to pass up to get Ergo out there to the wider market (and no real equivalent moral issue in my view - it‚Äôs crypto twitter!). Sentiment is mostly positive so far I think, Telegram/Discord is always a bit noisy but usually driven by a handful of people. Reddit probably the best place to measure sentiment easily (or twitter if you have lots of time). If we‚Äôre thinking of the same post probably downvoted due to dramatic title. 

Making it the EF account would have been worse, was discussed giving it to sigmanauts, utxo alliance - but Ergo Platform works better for the news cycle. I‚Äôm not too fussed about where it goes after the cycle - Original handle kept as a backup and there were plans to change it to EF.

He just wants attention


[10/07/2022 2:16 PM] koutelier#0000
He is where the crowd is . When the raven was trending he tweet he supports it . When ergo was hot the same . Man has to increase followers somehow


[10/07/2022 2:17 PM] koutelier#0000
He is looking for etc miners or supporters to follow him and like him imo

Personally I am glad ergo ditch the natural growth strategy . This is how it gets done . We have a well develop ‚Äúproduct‚Äù nothing to be afraid of , even the fuds bring huge exposure

(re @glasgowm : *Was discussed in the foundation chat, FUD was expected but figured it was too good of an opportunity to pass up to get Ergo out there to the wider market (and no real equivalent moral issue in my view - it‚Äôs crypto twitter!).

 Perhaps some community dissatisfaction might stem from these 2 things. 

1. With committing to use an account with 600k followers, it can be argued there is a moral issue. Newcomers could easily be under the impression the followers are legit, and thus deceived. 

2. Saying it‚Äôs just crypto Twitter might be downplaying it a bit maybe (?). Twitter is the largest and arguably the most important medium of communication in crypto.


[10/07/2022 2:23 PM] Frostyausty#0000
I think it‚Äôs nice that Charles offered the account, but doesn‚Äôt mean ergo had to accept the offer. Charles even said in the ama probably 90% of the followers are bots üòÉ


[10/07/2022 2:24 PM] Frostyausty#0000
I think koutelier makes a good point though. The foundations of ergo are so strong, it probably won‚Äôt have a negative effect long term üëç


[10/07/2022 2:28 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
Charles is a visionary, a king maker. His decision to ask us to make good use of it is an honour. We won‚Äôt scam anyone with this account, people will maybe learn more about us, for my part I‚Äôm forever grateful to Charles to have used his Cardano Youtube account to make me know about Ergo.


[10/07/2022 2:28 PM] koutelier#0000
I would suggest a huge giveaway with few ergs and tokens and nfts from all or most projects for the users that will follow the ‚Äúold‚Äù twitter if it‚Äôs still active and like and retweet the post . In that way both accounts will get huge. Then you can rebrand the old one to something else . Ergo miners or something


[10/07/2022 2:28 PM] koutelier#0000
Also in that way people will learn about ergo projects and nfts


[10/07/2022 2:32 PM] koutelier#0000
I think ergo platform account needs to tweet about the projects and the artists and everything Is currently being build no matter if it‚Äôs a serious project or just something funny. . Miners it‚Äôs not everything and shouldn‚Äôt be because at some point no miners will be active when everything is mined . So we need to show to people why ergo is kind of chains no matter what occasion or fuds

 1. People are deceived on a daily basis by bots, nation states, crypto-scams, influencers and more for malicious intent. I don‚Äôt think showing some followers some related tweets of a project innovating is some egregious crime all things considered.
2. No doubt an important medium, I meant creating some noise on crypto Twitter is what it‚Äôs good for.  

But yeh their twitter is pretty dead so maybe best returning after news-cycle for a positive spin

One downside is that the account can be used to scam people once we sell it. Reputational harm can potentially outweigh all benefits then.

I think we should accept this big parcel of gift from Charles Hoskinson. Ergo doesn't have enough marketing fund to attract as many as  600k  followers in a short period or in several years. Chinese community feels excited about this gift. Why not accept it.


[10/07/2022 3:09 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
I would agree, but it does seem that almost all followers are completely inactive, our original Twitter accounts posts had even more engagement than the new one, so not sure if it is actually worth it in the end


[10/07/2022 3:11 PM] Rongrong21#0000
Bear market makes the whole crypto community less active relative to the bull market.


[10/07/2022 3:12 PM] LuivatraEP#0000
Enjoy the buzz and then either give it back to ch or etc. If some of those 670k read up on ergo we xan call it a win. It would be foolish to think we get 670k active followers out of it. Might as well buy bot followers then


[10/07/2022 3:15 PM] Rongrong21#0000
Charles Hoskinson' action has caught the ETC community' attention. More and more people show interest in Ergo. However, before this, many Chinese ETC community members don't know Ergo.


[10/07/2022 3:18 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
You can also consider that maybe many of the followers of ETC were there because of Charles‚Äô involvement in it, and if he now thinks that Ergo is the place where these ideas are represented best, we have to respect his decision and accept it with humility but also with our own energy.


[10/07/2022 3:28 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
My 2 cents for what its worth...I 1st wonder if what is gained from it worth any negative feedback, both from within and outside of community. Though they have a large number of followers, how many are active and open to such messaging in this manner? 2nd, I understand it is Crypto Twitter, but I ask..Is it Ergo? Does it match our ethos? Do our ethos change depending on the platform and what is normally acceptable on it? In the end, I dont think it is as big of a deal as some may, however I do wonder if it is worth what we hope to gain from it.


[10/07/2022 3:40 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Also coming off the drama of difficulty adjustment and EIP-37, I wonder if this is what we want to be defending and justifying?


[10/07/2022 3:41 PM] mhs_sam#0000
Twitter account worths shit, the news around it is priceless indeed.
We knew that almost 90% of its followers are bots/inactive. It doesn‚Äôt matter at all.
CH did a vid today, it says it all. ETC is dead and a scam, ergo is spiritual successor of btc. That is the signal anything else is noise.

 Should apply ethos contextually yeah, seems pretty cyberpunk to me


[10/07/2022 3:42 PM] Rongrong21#0000
I believe that most of 600k inactive followers on the new twitter account will become active when the erg price rushes to a very high level when the bull market comes.


[10/07/2022 3:43 PM] Rongrong21#0000
If the twitter account is useless, why ETC community wants to get it back. The quantity of the followers on the account is key to them, so it is also important to ergo in the future.


[10/07/2022 3:50 PM] justin1000#0000
Yeah, when bull market returns, could be huge difference in having a twitter account with 70k followers and 700k followers in attracting new users even if it appears right now not to be so important. Ergo is built for mass adoption...adoption by many millions.


[10/07/2022 4:01 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
I get the importance of followers regarding perception of a project, and agree it can be a good tool to have. It is very cyberpunk, and personally I find the whole thing amusing. It seemed very sudden and without much planning involved, which may have been the case. So I guess my next question would be the best way to utilize it, which seems to be where you all are at now. Thoughts on it (or original acct.) be given to Sigmaverse?  Might be a very useful avenue to share whats going on in the ecosystem as a whole.

I can't speak for others, but that's not the part that gives me pause. CH & whats left of ETC community have their thing and that's on them to do what they please. CH had every right to do whatever he wanted with the account, IMO.

(re @Gazza_SP : *I would agree, but it does seem that almost all followers are completely inactive, our original Twitter accounts posts had even more engagement than the new one, so not sure if it is actually worth it in the end*) 
 
 this is perhaps the best analysis we should do. Of these 600k followers, how organic and active and engaged are they or will be, what are dead accounts, bots and fakes? will this account increase our real engagement, these metrics I believe twitter itself can pass Idk but it can be a comparison with the other twitter account, it's certainly a big billboard outside the bubble and that's incredible.


[10/07/2022 4:51 PM] Torto#0000
the moral part of the issue is more complicated to produce an analysis imo, as we have the bipolarity of crypo issues and twitter versus Ergo's purposes and resilience statements.

Community spent years building a good rep, ruined overnight by a few core actors and for what? Some more disapproving eyes on ergo? Now nobody looks at us and can believe what's in the manifesto, they know we'll stoop to dishonesty and false advertising if it's beneficial.

Many devs and community members have spoken out about what's happened here. Sad truth is its irreversible now, crypto has noticed us finally, for all the wrong reasons.

This is many people's first impression of Ergo, operating in scammy ways for attention and twitter followers. 
Same as buying followers IMO. Charles gifting the account shouldn't even come into it.
You can't make a twitter for one thing and rebrand to another. It's not honest or acceptable and everyone on twitter knows that.
Imagine if someone core has a falling out with ergo, changes the twitter pass and hands over to say, raven. That's what's happened here, it's a shit thing to do.

because there‚Äôs nuance, same way white lies aren‚Äôt deceptive


[10/07/2022 7:05 PM] glasgowm#0000
I‚Äôm more for the news-cycle though, not arguing for keeping it permanently

What is the news-cycle? What does that mean?


[10/07/2022 7:05 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
White lies are still deceptive, even if done with good intentions. I think your point is that if it helps ergo, it doesn't matter how its done. I disagree massively, and would argue its not helped at all.


[10/07/2022 7:06 PM] glasgowm#0000

 Yeah but you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre mums a deceptive bitch after you find out santa aint real is the point. Deceptive implies malicious intent - especially how you‚Äôre using it


[10/07/2022 7:07 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Yeah, it got some media attention and lots of tweets and hashtags. Even haters were using $erg and #ergo


[10/07/2022 7:08 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
So you think it's completely OK for projects to buy follows? Or just OK for ours? I think with foundation doing this, they're paid and obviously financially incentived. So the deception could very well be malicious here.


[10/07/2022 7:08 PM] glasgowm#0000

I'm hoping we can vote on a switch back. I'm personally considering dipping from ergo if this is what the foundation want to start doing.


[10/07/2022 7:11 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
How is it not the same result? We have taken on an account for advertising and clout purposes. Its exactly the same result as buying them.


[10/07/2022 7:11 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
We didn't need to protect etc investors or give them a better option. Even then, that account could've posted ergo content and had the same effect in a more respectable way

Regardless of sides, both agree that there is marketing/perception impact.  With many efforts being made by the community to help with that, it seems as though a descision made by a few has had a big impact. Thats my main takeaway from all this

I think in the spirit of decentralization a vote is probably best.


[10/07/2022 7:52 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Then at least the community will have its say which is at the core of what Ergo values more than anything.


[10/07/2022 8:00 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
How do you determine is someone gets a vote? How much ergo they hold?


[10/07/2022 8:00 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
No, everyone would get an equal vote imo.


[10/07/2022 8:01 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Maybe holding 1 erg in your wallet is enough.


[10/07/2022 8:01 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
That way bots wont have a chance to influence because theres no way bots are gonna be bothered to buy an erg just to vote.


[10/07/2022 8:01 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
idk how the vote would be implemented i just think one should probably happen if the community is this divideded

[10/07/2022 8:02 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
It needs to happen

(re  : *<HazeyOneKenobi> So pretty equivalent to me. We get followers we didn't earn*) 
 
 I don‚Äôt agree with the idea we didn‚Äôt earn them. We earned them because Charles, the owner of the account decided it. When a company takes over another one, they change the name of the company and it‚Äôs up to the clients to leave if they want, no one is obliged to remain subscribed, it doesn‚Äôt cost them anything to unsubscribe. Charles invested millions in the development of ETC and without him, ETC would not even be what it is today. I have a tremendous respect for his thought process in this delicate matter, we all know he tried to help ETC in many ways and it was rejected. Given what happened during this time, he would never have given the account back to ETC. I don‚Äôt see it as a breach of the manifesto. When I came to Ergo, I left the Verium community, and for this occasion I also changed my name and twitter handle. That‚Äôs the effect of Ergo, it makes twitter handles change.

If you are gifted things you have not earned them. Social media accounts for crypto aren't businesses, they aren't interchangeable. I'm not even gonna try and make that make sense bcos businesses doing that doesn't happen and it'd definitely be frowned upon. If you really want an analogy, It's like my gym becoming a cycling shop and sending me cycling promotions from then on out, it just doesn't happen. 

The issue for me isn't who made the account, or if we should be showing eth people ergo. It's us using an account which makes it seem like we have a ton of followers when we didn't legitimately build that following.

Currently, DeFi space has a lot of issues. Stablecoin protocols are requiring solid overcollateralization or depend on external actors to preserve peg (such as Luna Foundation Guard). No any framework to combine collaterals and trust has been proposed to the moment. As a result, DeFi is not widely used outside of cryptocurrency users circles.  I...

 Evolution is the process of natural selection. It‚Äôs cruel but it is what makes you so strong today. Growing Ergo means the death of other systems, I accepted it when I left Verium and embraced Ergo.


[10/08/2022 7:56 AM] lgd#5847
This would technically be artificial selection in our case. If it was really natural selection then you couldn't take any artificial advantage and just have to wait and see how the cards play out.


[10/08/2022 7:58 AM] lgd#5847
Also evolution has nothing to do with survival of the fittest, it's actually a misnomer. It has to do with organisms that are able to adapt when their environment changes. Evolution is the act of being adaptable. This is why humans are an interesting species, because we are able to adapt to different situations very easily, tho not without some pain haha.


[10/08/2022 8:02 AM] upwindstrategy#0000
Charles is one opinion among others, he cannot by himself make ETC die, although he has by himself let it survive. If we choose to let this account just left inactive I‚Äôm totally fine with it, but hand it over to ETC would also be immoral regarding the will of the person who gifted this account to us. I‚Äôm not saying we should use it, I‚Äôm saying that it‚Äôs a signal that ETC faith is more than likely sealed. In our communities, people have to spend energy time and money to make the community grow, if it doesn‚Äôt grow anymore, the community adapts and looks for alternatives of more efficient use of their energy.


[10/08/2022 8:08 AM] lgd#5847
The problem with trying to fit your analogy to processes of nature is that logically you can extend that argument to then justify doing anything. This is incredibly dangerous.

Very strange how people keep projecting their morals on others. No, you cannot justify anything with the logic laid out here - you are just using harsh words to browbeat people into thinking your opinion is the right one and it's very disappointing to see from people in ergo

I cannot understand why the English community is unhappy with the new Twitter account. I just know that the whole Chinese community was very happy when they heard the news about the new account. It is good to the entire Ergo community. Ergo was fairly launched, resulting in no enough marketing budget. Charles gave us the gift and we just accept it and use it properly.  ETC lost his twitter account not because of Ergo but because of the conflict between ETC and Charles Hoskinson. If Ergo didn't accept it, ETC community will still lose this account and have to create a new one.

I think we should do better to show all the followers on the new account that Ergo is much better choice than ETC and let them find that Ergo is really a gem that has a great promising future. Maybe in the future, this action by Charles save a lot of ETC followers if ETC was really a dead horse.

 See why I said Sam, don't. This requires sugar coating...(because I know your nature..complusive but accorate...) We love the fundaments and potencia of ergo but having debate and right to vote is the beauty of decentralized community, where governance persids in everyone .... By selling erg and buying etc we are not fixing any thing.... We can still buy erg and agree with fundaments, cause but disagree with the decisions made... Tulo is just saying the maybe a feedback before things things of this huge impact should be voted  and discussed with community atleast... Why do we do voting for EIP's then? Why not just implement and we done.

 thanks for the advise, I appreciate it.

again, I was not into "you" as specific people and I think the debate is needed and helpful. I was not going to suppress opinions here. No one should accept anything by force. however, I think it is necessary to be clear in what we base our opinion are. In this case, "returning to ETC" is bs, if you want to debate you should base your opinion on "returning to CH".

about voting and decentralization, we should definitely separate things. The chain is decentralized and we do not force any change on it, even node 5 that took more than a year of hard work needs an onchain voting, simple.

When things come to another kinds of decision, still decentralization matters but the context is different. That's why we have EF, we have this group of ergonauts, we have sigmanauts,...

In the tw case, the thing is voted in EF. Not all of EF members was supporting it for sure, but when decision is made, every member will support it. Do you know my vote?

Okay, then you may say it should be voted in this group. Despite the NDA nature of some deals, what if it was voted yes in this group and a broader audience was against it now? 
Also, this kind of things are not singleton decisions and it's more about bigger partnerships and roadmaps. Anyone here against partnership with IOG and Cardano? Should we disclose the details here while there are NDAs?

It's pretty great to see ergo maturing. Change is high tech is always messy, and change for a community as sweet as ergo is bound to be bumpy, but I have much of my career and also my financial faith in ergo.

This Twitter debacle will not be the last. Maybe it's a good thing, but to those who feel it's, "lemons" please make us some delicious lemonade!

Hi everyone!
I started this account with memes about an important topic. @ErgoFoundation made the decision to use an account with many followers from the ETC community. Many #Ergo community members don't like this decision, but ultimately, it's the foundation's decision. (1/5)

Perhaps this is just my personal experience, but it seems that a lot of community members are unaware on how to formally create a future EIP.

What is the criteria/specific rubric required for a real proposal, how can we make it more familiar & approachable for prominent members to submit a proposal?

Prior to EIP-37 implementation, in my Twitter Space, there was some confusion about how it was created and the decision-makers involved. (As if only the EF can create EIP37s or are the best suited to propose EIPs due to Alex being the author of #37 it seems)

To the best of my knowledge, this is not true. They would like more transparency, guidelines, and accessibility to the formal process of EIP formulation. Thanks üôèüèº 

I can submit proof of this desire, I recorded the EIP37 space about a week ago with Ilya from Dappstep & Cheese Enthusiast from GetBlok

[10/11/2022 2:56 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
But spectrum bots require running a node. So, technically speaking, node operators have additional revenue streams not available to those who don't run nodes. Although I know that answer doesn't satisfy everyone lol.

in general, it should work on a normal system - can't see a problem there. but we already talked about it, you can expect some losses when device dozes.
On my former day job, we kept a bunch of android devices always on for testing purposes, always plugged in. the devices are not built for that, constant problems with bloating batteries etc.


[10/11/2022 9:16 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I think we discussed before, I still think a raspi with a good custom case is better suited for node.


[10/11/2022 9:19 AM] Darkkknight111#0000
I personally think that if we do android device, user can give it more utility to an android device then a raspi... You can use android box as media streaming while it's doing node stuff

 I agree. And there are more points which aren't mentioned: 

- Some followers of the old Ergo account who didn't check twitter last week will not notice that they have to follow a new account. They will just don't see any new news/tweets.

Last I'll comment on it...Descision, regardless of where you stand on it, was top-down driven without input from the community who has been taking the mantle of spreading awareness and Manifesto Principals. I dont agree with that type of descision making  when the repercussions involve the community so much.. CH, EF, nor the Ergo Community should be the ones who decide who 670k people (and bots) follow, especially in a manner that for all intents and purposes was quite centealized. Regardless of how we feel about ETC as a project, why do CH and then EF feel as if it is their duty to make that choice for users and followers? How and why did this become their issue to solve and our issue to debate in the aftermath? For me, those are the main points/questions.


[10/11/2022 2:55 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Effects and reasoning of descision are all important, I just argue that they should be at the front end of these type of imapctful initiatives rather than the back end.

 CH made an offer, not a choice. Yes the EF is centralised and it‚Äôs purpose is to make these strategic decisions (But also all EF members came from community). The goal is decentralisation and what we strive for but not there yet. Hopefully this pushes us a bit closer.

 let's try full decentralization for the next exchange listing. let the community know in advance and choose the next exchange, vote for it and collect $1M for the listing fees. Or it is sth that EF is responsible for?

With all due respect, I think that's taking my perspective a bit further than was laid out. EF does amazing work for a community that always wants more...and for that I am grateful. There wasn't an argument made that all descisions, especially the type you mentioned, should be left to comminity.

Thanks for clarification, so we're in the same page.
okay then, FYI EF is not a single person who decides. It's a few guys from the community. Every single decision of EF might have opponents in the EF too. That's why we vote for any single decision and if the Yay votes are the majority it will be the EF decision. Then every single EF member will and should support it.

Every single community member may like or dislike some decisions and that's fine and natural and everyone should respect it.


[10/11/2022 3:23 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Tis the beauty of decentralized communities,  no? Not always gonna get your way but you push forward and see the forest through the trees. Im just trying to reverse engineer this whole thing for clarity and understanding so that we can all get back to the things that matter just as proudly as we have prior to this happening.

 Although I don't like the decision, I agree that it is the Ergo Foundation's decision. 

I, as a community member, would like to see more public information about the Ergo Foundation. There is a blog post listing the members and a rather inactive twitter account. Afaik there is no website. The foundation has a lot of responsibility and power, but imo close to zero visibility. I think it is often difficult to understand which decision is made by the foundation, what are the relationships between core devs and the foundation, how is the foundation governed,... 

I don't want to check how the foundation spends funds or what are its daily activities, but I would like to learn more about the structure of the foundation and related entities.


[10/11/2022 3:42 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I think part of it somewhat relates that we're so used to the EF taking the community's opinions into account that when that didnt happen this time a lot of people were taken aback. I appreciate the honesty in admitting that the EF and some of the decision making is centralized. I am for keeping the account FYI, however it probably should have gone to vote. Either way, I'm good with getting Ergo out in the public more. However, it's been a lot of bad press which sucks. I guess we will just wait and see what happens. I don't think it's as big of a deal as many are making it out to be. Just my 2 cents.

 Yes, in the dashboard we convert the keys to the staked/vested tokens, which may be all you really need if you already grab prices.  

Anyway, I can send you a link to our epic in github for danaides and also call out the specific task for this when I create it if you like?

 Yes! Saw Armeanio a few times. Good stuff. People are hyped on Ergo. The Delivery Manager for MLabs really wants to do a Catalyst Proposal for getting ErgoScript into Cardano Node / on-chain. They‚Äôve had a lot of success on funding there and they were talking about how it would be so much better programming-wise with that implementation. I have contact info I can send to anyone and we can start working on that talk setting up a proposal and what those guys are thinking if there‚Äôs a best route to go about all this just let me know Ergonauts

Someone is seriously fucking with BSV lol. Mining pool "Unknown" is grabbing the majority of blocks, doesn't put any transactions in these blocks, meanwhile bankrupting the other mining pools if they can keep this going for a while. Hilarious. What a trainwreck. üòÇ

 I think they will do update all social branding with the upcoming V3 platform, but @anon_br might be able to give more details.

[10/24/2022 5:40 PM] Tefcek21#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *As sigmaverse i try to stay neutral and retweet everything in the ecosystem*) 
 
 and I think everyone appreciates that, I'm not actually challenging everyone to share their opinion, just to mention them, so they can get a chance to be discovered.


[10/24/2022 5:41 PM] Tefcek21#0000
Projects such as Paideia, Azorus, Blitz, Spectrum have huge potential to expand Ergo and onboard new community member. I might be wrong with that, thats why I wanted to open up the discussion here.


[10/24/2022 5:42 PM] NoahErgo#0000
No i think its true. Just tough right now even when things are shared engagement is pretty low


[10/24/2022 5:43 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Still gotta keep at it anyway

Or what it even is

(re @ergomergoadargo : *We could use the marketing or sigmanaut channels (or make a new one) as the place where projects give a breakdown of things that are great about their projects (in simple language preferably)
And then ergonauts/sigmanauts can pick up on those and tweet away*) 
 
 @Tefcek21 what about alliance chat for such purposes


[10/24/2022 5:46 PM] Darkkknight111#0000
Ooh we could start working on creating guild and giving task to each group,one does marketing, graphics,content and shilling

(re @AngieHar : *@Tefcek21 what about alliance chat for such purposes*) 
 
 Hi Angie! 
That would be great, now that I'm "out" as the voice of Auction house I should join


[10/24/2022 5:47 PM] Tefcek21#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *No i think its true. Just tough right now even when things are shared engagement is pretty low*) 
 
 That might be true, but I'm sure we can find  a way to keep the engagement high, for example by giving each project a week or so. 

I am addressing this just because, last friday I was kinda upset and felt bad for Azorus, when they presented the Alpha Demo and there were like 20 people which is in my opinion really underrated for such a project with a huge potential. 

So I thought me as a Sigmanaut, how could we change that and support these smaller projects?

 Thanks Alexis! We were expecting 10 but a solid 20ish showed up for the entire demo. The low attendance makes it more intimate and since it's still low exposure gives us more time to improve our presentation style so I wouldn't sweat it too much üòâ

edit: especially in this market condition, general crypto sentiment (tired), we aren't ready to IDO, and what we are building isn't as straightforward - i would say it exceeded our expectations

(re @Tefcek21 : *I think the Auction House team is doing good, and the project deserves more attention especially with having a ton of development already, however its hard to sellout during such a market.*) 
 
 I think it is better to launch one or more IDOs whenever the ERG price rises instead of on a fixed monthly basis.


[10/25/2022 3:48 AM] Rongrong21#0000
The community members like to pay less ergs for new ido project tokens.


[10/25/2022 3:50 AM] Rongrong21#0000
For example, if the IDOs for ergopos and auction house were done when the erg prices rise to over 5usd, I think more people would like to contribute to these projects.


[10/25/2022 5:22 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I tend to agree.

We are seeking growth points for Spectrum Finance. And we realised that it‚Äôs impossible to grow the product without driving the ecosystem growth.

 The objective should be 

a) showing how active the Ergo ecosystem is development-wise, and 

b) making Ergo an appealing playground for Cardano devs - @Armeanio shines at this imo

hey guys, while i work on the voting thing i was thinking...is there an easy way to scrape mining addresses for the last week before the difficulty change? i'd like to design and mint a nice token or nft to distribute to the miners that stuck through it. @Cheese Enthusiast ?


[11/01/2022 11:08 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
It would be pool specific.  We could pull our data but you would need the same for each pool. Current API would only show miners currently mining.  

Possibly you could get all the wallet addresses from each pool and then check explorer payouts for those addresses for a given time period.

Hello.
I‚Äôd like to suggest to contact with Moonpay (or similar service) and add a ‚ÄúBuy ERG‚Äù link (something like this (https://www.moonpay.com/buy/ada)) to the Ergo website.
From the Spectrum‚Äôs side we will add the same link to Spectrum Finance app (1inch example (https://app.1inch.io/#/1/unified/swap/ETH/DAI), see ‚ÄúBuy ETH‚Äù button in the header).

*What are the theoretical benefits?*
Such a link reduce the level of entry into the ecosystem by creating a fiat -> crypto funnel in our ecosystem. This way the conversion to Ergo user (or holder) can increase.

 Yeah it‚Äôs a good idea and something we‚Äôve tried to do before (via yoroi). Have you looked into Moonpay and it‚Äôs requirements? Issue with the buy now button via yoroi was that we had no ERG/FIAT pair on Changelly and weren‚Äôt able to get it due to some legal requirement IIRC

 1. What exactly were the legal issues? 2. Is there a way to resolve them with current resources? 3. Can we prioritize this task in your backlog? 4. Is something else needed to resolve it?

 Don't remember, was related to changelly and getting the fiat pair added.  but not important as yoroi is mince anyway and not something we'd want a button on. Reincorporating in Dubai I believe so can look into it after that.

 I don‚Äôt suggest adding the button in Yoroi or somewhere else. I suggest to add it to ergoplatform.org and app.spectrum.fi firstly.
The link will be available for everyone, so that all other dapp will be able to add it to their platforms.
When can we back to this conversation?

 The fastest way to include this to the website is to link to bit2me: https://bit2me.com/buy-ergo

Had a call with one of the largest Wallet-Engine providers today.

Outcome: "We support Cardano but no Cardano Native Tokens yet because there's not enough demand."

This is a typical reaction. We need MORE stuff in Cardano. More builders, more money, more everything.

 You need censorship/freeze features to directly support a flat crypto funnel on chain.

You can do it through liquidity partners (exchanges)

 Awesome, before that - Jami is organizing a twitter space matching Ergo devs to their Cardano counterparts next Thursday (Nov 10th)
Based on @oskin , @yashablack and Jami's time availability, it's likely to be at 8pm UTC

It'd be great if you - and as many Ergo devs as possible - could join that too üôèüèª

Rosen bridge is already running since yesterday. We did some misestimation about resources needed by guards that resulted in time outs and crashes. I'm working on adding 1-2 more servers and redeploy the guards.
Meanwhile, we got an probably memory-leak issue with wasm. Greenhat is helping on this and also we're going to reduce/change using the wasm library. so far so good.

I'll announce it publicly in a week when the servers are ready and the first txns are being processed. Please keep this info private and do not publish it.

 Not sure what permission you're after exactly. Webhooks? Don't think there is one for adding a bot to a specific channel otherwise.

For ERG/SigUSD, there are 4 kinds of DEXes already, SigUSD bank, Spectrum's AMM LP, grid trading smart orders, babel fees. With out-of-box composability, liquidity is immediately shared when a new kind of DEX is launched.

Hi guys, I have two marketing ideas:

1. With the launch of the babel fee and the Rosen bridge on Ergo and Cardano, we should cooperate with Charles in marketing these two features so that the crypto lovers inside and beyond the Ergo and Cardano communities can better understand the advantages of these key features. For example, by holding  AMAs on the launch of babel fees and Rosen bridge on Charles' youtube account or by publishing news on babel fees and rosen bridge on mainstream media agencies like cointelegraph so that the people in the entire industry can know what is happening on Ergo and Cardano and what advantages Ergo and Cardano can provide.

2. Create a dedicate twitter or use the old twitter account to aggregate the important tweets on Ergo, projects built on top of ergo, hot events that have happened or are happening in the crypto space, like FTX exchange bankruptcy, so that the ergo followers can get key  information via one twitter account instead of several or many accounts.

 Idea 1..
I like it   ,but doing it will require us to change of doing things in future ( adapting to how things are normally done in other chains "make an event" promote and launch...it requires planning and  takes time.... At ergo we like to drop tools and dapps as surprise. Without any pre-planning)

Second idea
There are already few account which do erg/ada content , I m focusing on video content / content creators / events / podcasts on ergcube

@MrStahlfelge @anon_br In bip32, there is a 4 byte checksum which is missing in eip003. Is that intentional? 
currently, minotaur is using this checksum and therefore its xpub is not compatible with nautilus and mobile wallet. should I get rid of these checksum? or should we update the eip?


[11/13/2022 6:36 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Yoroi implemented it this way, paper wallet followed and we then as well to be compatible.
Changing the EIP would need backwards compatibility fallbacks all over the place, so would suggest to keep it that way.

 okay, sounds good. I'll add it as an alternative to minotaur then, so it can work with both.

 does it make sense to describe the process and any interchanged data and its formatting in an EIP?

Hi, guys, why not hold an event on creating the same logos with different numbers for all ergonauts. We number these logos according to the date of an ergonaut who joined the Ergo team or Ergo community. For example, Alex may get the logo marked No. 1. We can also number their names on the logo. Just  like the work permit for  the No. 1 employee. Then, we can use our logos on Telegram, Discord, Twitter and anywhere possible. We can add our nickname or name on that logo too.  Through this event, I think more people we will get to know ergo via our special logo. The Ergo community members will have sense of belonging, namely, they are part of Ergo and are willing to spread Ergo to the public via their logos on the social media.

 in simple words, you want a identity card for everyone, which can be minted and also sold as nfts, but i think it will make more sense if people invest in ergonames and get the ergoname :)

 ok, so besides that and the work we need correcting new users, it's mainly cardano they've boned from that standpoint of genesis funds.


[11/17/2022 7:36 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
As far as I understand, maybe I‚Äôm wrong, they left to work on solutions for Solana and got VC funding for it.

(re @yashablack : *Absolutely agree but we don‚Äôt know everything about their internal situation regarding wallets to build 100% opinion that their devs and management suck and so on.*) 
 
 I don‚Äôt know every detail of their organisational structure, but enough to comment, don‚Äôt see why Emurgo is above critique anyway. 

I did have to deal with them directly (as well as the thousands of annoyed yoroi users) over the years-long debacle; while they ignored us - asked us to tell our users to be nicer and refused to meet with Armeanio after some feedback - and other equally ridiculous things. The wallet is a direct interface people use and makes a big impression, so it is hugely valuable and not hard to solve with seemingly unlimited funds. As expected, it had a huge impact on the image (even in the Cardano community). 

Hopefully, they can get their act together and contribute something meaningful, but since dcspark left, they‚Äôve mostly been an embarrassment.


[11/18/2022 2:55 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Even before the dcSpark guys left, Yoroi wasn't really great. Especially the mobile version for Cardano.


[11/18/2022 3:00 PM] glasgowm#0000
At least they were trying and responsive tho, afterwards they done things which exarcerbated issues like scrapping their explorer instances and relying on the default instance which created a ton of issues for a long time IIRC - and not somewhere you should be cutting corners if you‚Äôre throwing around $100m‚Äôs


[11/18/2022 3:09 PM] Armeanio#0000
They want to discontinue yoroi for ergo at some point. Trying to get them to extend the life of the product in some form while encouraging users to switch.


[11/18/2022 3:09 PM] Armeanio#0000
We will need to put together some sigmanaut and marketing support to let everyone know.

 But what's the benefit? Cardano people don't use Yoroi anymore, so that's no argument. And they will always be late with updates and support.

Monero's social media team decided to go on full attack mode against midnight, fudding on the project, Cardano, IOG and Charles, whilst getting their "facts" from a poorly written coindesk article, instead of going to the heaps of published papers, that prove their rants to be complete false.
Not only did they do that, they decided to double down on this malarkey several times after.
This kind of behavior cannot go unchecked. They're spreading lies.
I will not allow this to happen in any ecosystem that I am involved in. If someone decides to spread lies about Ergo, I will be just as vocal with zero regrets

 Does Monero have an official social media team? That's what I am asking. Or is the account just run by fans/community members.


[11/19/2022 11:28 AM] Gstoiti#0000
I am not against calling out if someone spreads lies. That's great. The questions is just is Monero as a project spreading lies or just someone who owns the @Monero twitter handle?


[11/19/2022 11:29 AM] Gstoiti#0000
That's a huge difference


[11/19/2022 11:33 AM] glasgowm#0000
not really an important distinction since it‚Äôs the main account / representative of the brand


[11/19/2022 11:34 AM] glasgowm#0000
but his tweets call out the actions of that account directly anyway


[11/19/2022 11:34 AM] Gstoiti#0000
For example on getmonero.org there is no marketing workgroup listed. The only two twitter accounts listed are @xmroutreach and @MoneroSpace

We had the same problem weeks ago. People discredited Ergo as a project, because the foundation made a twitter move with the main Ergo account.

Yeah, just make sure to only shit on his face and not on the face of other people working on the same project who weren't involved in the decision.


[11/19/2022 11:49 AM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
If anyone in the Monero community feels like the account doesn't speak for them, they're welcome to come out and be heard, just like people from the Ergo community did that did not agree with the ETC account handover.

We also need to clearly distinguish Spectrum and other DEXes from simulations like Serum, which was compromised recently: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/solana-based-serum-may-compromised-151742537.html

"According to a report, Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko said in a tweet message that Serum's original key may have been compromised with the FTX hack, and developers are working on forking Serum's code."

Spectrum does not have keys to compromise.

Equalizing Spectrum on top of Ergo with pseudo-DEX Serum on top of pseudo-blockchain Solana is insulting to developers and supporters who do care about decentralization.

just my 2 cents , whatever is build on ergo needs to be promoted by ergo as long as it's not a scam and it has good intention
  because this is the life of ergo. especially if that is the only dex that probably give the a lot of daily tx on the network and the huge marketing to ergo platform.

 Noted mate and fair point. Angie can you please update. 

As for other points made, theyre taken on board and always open to idea and suggestions on what to cover. 

What id like to see is Ergo promote the protocol, the technology, values (manifesto) etc. As well as education and general blogs that are easy to digest. 

The ecosystem whilst still young, is growing rapidly. We are seeing more apps, utilities, projects coming online that also need to find their voice which many have are are doing. 

For example the article Kushti posted about Serum hack is a great opportunity for Sprectum to highlight the key differences of the platforms. 

Yes from Ergo side we can like, retweet, cross post those projects content on our various main social channels


[11/19/2022 10:57 PM] CW#0000
I've been trying to lure some more copy writers into the ecosystem for internal writings but also we/the ecosystem can lean on sigmanauts skills throughout to help promote the ecosystem. 

I think previously while we were still small enough the core had enough bandwidth to cover the ecosystem as a whole but as we grow and evolve, focusing on core releases and how the ecosystem/users/developers can benefit from their usage has the biggest impact 

The biggest draw cards to the ecosystem as it grows are the projects building on Ergo, we can help promote them but as mentioned, as the ecosystem grows through size and competition between projects increases it's up to them to highlight key points of difference

hey sorry for bringing this back up but as someone who has 15+ years of professional fortune 100 SEO experience this is the incorrect mindset.

SEO optimizes for search engine visibility but they should always be placed as a secondary content consumer. Your primary target should be the human reader - everything else after that you are optimizing in terms of keywords, link, etc is just a bonus for search engines to crawl, index, and ultimately rank your page. 

IMO if Ergo content strategy is "it's for bots" then we've already failed. In fact, we should be asking: if someone lands on this page what do we want them to do? What is the call to action? OK now I know the difference between CEX vs DEX. So what? What is the next step in the user conversion funnel? Should they join Discord? Create a wallet? Sign up for a CEX instead so we can make money off affiliate links?

+1 to @yashablack mentioning earlier that we need stronger strategic and marketing support here. Happy to chat and help out where I can but needs to start thinking about the big picture and not just riding off SEO keyword tools that say we should target X keyword because it has Y searches per month.

 i do what i do for free and it's a majority of my spare time. there is sooo much to cover but i can understand both points of view pretty well (since i do community dev stuff as well as social stuff as well as try to be everywhere at once). 

it's easy to get wrapped up in this with voices seemingly isolated on each side considering each individuals experience. i've been to places in ergo and cardano that have no idea what others in the community are doing because they are so hyper focused...and also have no chance of relating to eachother or able to put themselves in their shoes. important thing is to bring those viewpoints and experiences together to fill in the gaps. 

We can do this without getting any panties in a bunch too. Official comm not putting out stuff you agree with, hit them up and let them know, which yasha/kushti did pretty well. CW/Angie respond and hear it, expresses what some other issues they deal with are, and adds other solutions for the community to also help. Now, there is a community accountability check in place.

And the kicker, if we don't like what is happenning then we do it our GD selves. At least, that's what ERGO means to me.

@yb I didnt write the original article but I did provide updates. I will be adding a section on spectrum as per Angie's requests. As she stated, the best thing to do is to just politely ask. Very simple. I will make sure thats done tonight. Cheers!

(re @yashablack : *@seedubya just curious, why ergo marketing team writes article about dexes and cexes, promotes (aka mentions cexes) and don‚Äôt mention its own ecosystem dex. Why?*) 
 
 Initially i wrote it, but seems it's updated. At the time ErgoDEX not even released beta. Article was a general information piece mentioning some bit about DeFi on Ergo. There are articles later released about ErgoDEX specifically. Yes it could've been also mentioned in that article

To demonstrate using leverage on https://t.co/eTeI8L7bzY, I have created a fresh wallet with exactly 1 Erg on it. 

I will use this ERG to go long on sigRSV with about 3x leverage. 

I will post updates as my position progresses.

(re @FoeniculumNFTs : *Guys we seriously need devs or their marketing team to push their products more aggressively*) 
 
 Yeah this is required. We have amazing products live and in development but modest about making noise themselves. 

A number are making waves and on the right track. It takes a lot of time and commitment to keep engagement high. 

For example on the nft side there could be posts about daily sales, weekly KPIs posted, random sale info, artist highlights on there platforms 

Mining side we have get blok and I've talked at length about possibilities around smart pools, miner defi, fimo and all that with rob. Be great to see pool stats, posts highlighting miner defi, how it's achieved, pay outs rewarded 

Ergopad is going to town on their Ico's etc.

Spectrum starting to find their voice, could integrate marching for large trades, deposits or similar nature. 

Just a couple of quick brain stormed ideas and examples that I could see things improve and see more consistent engagement.

Once again its a dedicated time and financial commitment to keep it up

The community will rally behind this sort of thing 100%

 Thanks @NoahErgo for the mention üôåüèΩ

We had this discussion internally in our team, and I think we could do way way better with more resources and funds for the marketing. 

We need support from each and everyone in the Ecosystem, you found a good way share it with the other teams, apply for listings, share your resources / connections, ask for help and share advise, do collaborations in posting articles.


[11/21/2022 9:14 PM] Tefcek21#0000
What I personally is really sad is that we as ErgoPad and Paideia are using our platform to help other Ergo projects too, for example by posting or commenting their stuff. 

I'm challenging everyone here to do the same, take 15minutes every day and keep commenting and liking other peoples / projects tweets.


[11/21/2022 9:14 PM] Tefcek21#0000
How is it possible that we have more than 50-100 sigmanauts but less then 50 likes on some projects tweets ?


[11/21/2022 9:14 PM] Tefcek21#0000
Thats the most simple task for a Sigmanaut.


[11/21/2022 9:15 PM] Tefcek21#0000
Twitter activity is important, if a newbie is going through a Twitter profile and see a lot of engagement he is way more attracted to the project.


[11/21/2022 9:16 PM] Tefcek21#0000
Look at Charles, he is the best marketing guy in cypto imo. He keeps talking about hot news and headlines. He calls out solana and eth, or any other project and is getting a lot of attention to Cardano through that


[11/21/2022 9:17 PM] Tefcek21#0000
We still waiting for the ERGO integration on CMC and CG. Which is hurting us a lot!

(re @Tefcek21 : *Twitter activity is important, if a newbie is going through a Twitter profile and see a lot of engagement he is way more attracted to the project.*) 
 
 This can't be underestimated. Like, comments, retweets from a community perspective drives engagement/impressions in turn shown to more people.

From the project/user perspective need the regular commitment to posting 2-3 times a day to drive the above


[11/21/2022 9:22 PM] HQ3rr#0000

(re @HQ3rr : *You remember when I said "you guys have to promote more ergopad then the IDOS" first you have to creat your base and then the stakers and investors will come automatically :)*) 
 
 You know how hard it is to do that without people not knowing about Ergo, how Ergo and the wallets are working, without being listed 100% on these important platforms such ad CMC and CG? 

And do you know how much resources it takes to do that. This can't be done by only one project.


[11/21/2022 9:27 PM] Tefcek21#0000
We need support from other people and projects, otherwise each and everyone will only be responsible for themselves which is not efficient.

 I try to make conversation with cardano community wherever possible. Many people are interested there just been waiting for certain things to come online like bridge, more dapps, etc. I think rosen will be a huge gateway for people interested in ergo to dip their feet into the water.

and it made me extremely bullish on Ergo


[11/21/2022 11:12 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *@Tefcek21 does amazing work in this regard*) 
 
 Yess!! The main problem is that lots of smaller projects might be lacking the funding and/or expertise to market their products like they'd deserve


[11/21/2022 11:13 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
We can leverage the Sigmanaut program in that regards


[11/21/2022 11:13 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
ü•∫Problem: 
Ergo is thriving with amazing gems, who are flying under the radar due to lack of marketing communications caused by teams' lack of funds / expertise

üòãSolution:
Assign a number of Ergonauts to different Ergo projects, whose aim is to translate devs updates of their assigned project in 

a) easily understandable words and 

b) visually pleasing, professional ways: e.g. well written twitter threads, articles, infographics and or COMPARISONS W/ CARDANO COUNTERPARTS! (e.g. how's Duckpools different from Liqwid Finance?)

üòéExample:
1) I'm assigned to Duckpools.
I ask Duckpools devs questions such as:
-What makes Duckpools unique?
-What are you working on atm?
-Any question that makes me better understand the project

2) I create content in the form of a simple tweet, a twitter thread, or an infographic related to a specific topic e.g. leveraged lending on Duckpools!

üòçResult:
Newbies will learn about Ergo gems who don't have funding to hire marketing teams.

Non-newbies will be kept up to date easily, which in turn will make it easier for them to share such content and get a nice ripple effect


[11/21/2022 11:14 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
TLDR: assign different Sigmanauts to different projects building on Ergo;

They'll be like marketing interns, communicating with the teams to learn about their project and producing content covering it

(re @FoeniculumNFTs : *TLDR: assign different Sigmanauts to different projects building on Ergo;

 I am not sure, if all sigmanaut's have time & desire to do that...maybe because there isn't any kind of "funding"

(re @HQ3rr : *I am not sure, if all sigmanaut's have time & desire to do that...maybe because there isn't any kind of "funding"*) 
 
 Well Sigmanauts join the program because they like to support Ergo, this just gives them a bit more structure rather than let such amazing resources sit idle or without a precise goal to work on


[11/21/2022 11:18 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000

[11/21/2022 11:19 PM] HQ3rr#0000
In yesterday meeting i suggested to creat some kind of a dapp where people can get rewards by doing tasks , that's how ,we can track the dedication of new sigcans and also see who is good on what, and lacks on what.... Then we can start creating groups and evolve


[11/21/2022 11:19 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000

(re @Tefcek21 : *How is it possible that we have more than 50-100 sigmanauts but less then 50 likes on some projects tweets ?*) 
 
 I don‚Äôt think this is particularly fair to the Sigmanauts, 47 now, all promoted for individual reasons. Some won‚Äôt be on Twitter, many not every day, some are devs busy with their own projects or life, or doing their own thing as Sigmanauts like hosting discussions, writing articles, making sites or helping build up the structure of the programme itself - so shouldn‚Äôt be any expectation they‚Äôd be doing anything other than contributing. It _is_ a good tactic, and something myself and others have reminded people of occasionally (and in the onboarding docs); but such reminders will always need repeating and the sigmanauts role is more to have discussions like these and figure out ways to bake it into the community so it happens automatically. Whether that be something like reminding the community to do it, setting up some structure - and I‚Äôll just hit send here as Foen just has)

 Honestly I feel like lots of people -including myself- feel a bit too overwhelmed by Discord so we naturally avoid it if we can

The Ergo discord especially is not easy to navigate due to the large number of channels, so that might be keeping people from engaging with the Sigma-can/naut channels

Commenting on the video may make him notice . Do we have a nice documentation about roses perks ?


[11/22/2022 10:07 PM] LuivatraEP#0000
a lot of bridge "hacks" happened because the hacker got a hold of a majority of keys in a multi sig setup. rosen also uses multisig


[11/22/2022 10:08 PM] LuivatraEP#0000
just from documentation it wont show much, it is all about decentralizing the watchers and guardians as much as possible


[11/22/2022 10:08 PM] LuivatraEP#0000
not like some bridge where one dev had a whole bunch of keys on his machine üòÖ


[11/22/2022 10:09 PM] koutelier#0000
Rosen also requires smart contracts from one side isn‚Äôt that making it more secure as well?


[11/22/2022 10:09 PM] LuivatraEP#0000
not if the guardians' keys are compromised


[11/22/2022 10:10 PM] LuivatraEP#0000
but yes it is better than smart contracts on both sides because the ergo side can be focused on to be secure, then all that is left is ensure the guardians themself are secure

hello marketing folks, I think the time is right to make some more noise about the cold wallet functionality of our wallet app. it is a feature that is rare on crypto, and many people don't understand or don't believe at first that it is possible to sign and submit transactions without internet connectivity. we have two videos on the feature, but videos need to be watched and understood. what we need is a good informational graphic explaining the concept so that it can be used in a single tweet or post. is someone here able to do that?

 Having no idea on the apple side of things, am I correct in thinking it can't be sideloaded like android? Needs to be hot for a short amount of time to install?


[11/24/2022 9:38 AM] HQ3rr#0000
What's the minimum android  and iOS V required for the cold wallet?

(re @seedubya : *Having no idea on the apple side of things, am I correct in thinking it can't be sideloaded like android? Needs to be hot for a short amount of time to install?*) 
 
 yes, you need to install the app from app store and air gap then. it is not a problem when you generate your secrets later, but updates are not possible. you don't need to update though.


[11/24/2022 9:40 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000

 Android 7.0, iOS 13.0, for raspi 64 bit is needed, for the other desktop versions I honestly not know

Lil request and suggestion here, we have too many unfollowed projects which might be 30% done and lack things which  most of experienced Devs can help with ... I m listing dapps and all other stuff on ergcube and I am not seeing any of projects which popped up in community chats, past 6 months ..can we focus on finishing projects? I know Rosen is the main focus now... Start working on multichain stuff maybe?

> "Here's my 2 cents, we understand your frustrations about the delays with our beta launch. We are working as fast as we can, but please understand that, for most of us, Nightowl is not our full time job and we work on it when we have available time. Unfortunately, some of us had other priorities in life that we needed to take care of which delayed the release of the beta launch. We want to deliver a solid product that gives the best user experience and that takes time. We discovered some bugs with our final testing and are in the process of fixing them correctly.

[11/24/2022 4:47 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Unless you are a dev willing to help or have money to throw at a project to incentivize them what is the point of this kind of complaining

I know, we can't push people to "make it happen" but maybe a time to time check won't be bad

Some months ago, I was asked what I thought would be #Cardano "next big thing".

At the time, we only had a vague idea of what Leios was. The recent CIP from Duncan & al has shed some more light on it. 

Ouroboros Leios is definitely the most promising L1 upgrade to come

What would be the steps needed for miners to raise the fees?


[11/27/2022 1:43 AM] CW#0000
(re @Gstoiti : *What would be the steps needed for miners to raise the fees?*) 
 
 It's a simple majority for them to adjust. More than 50% of mining pools agreeing on a fee update

Ergonauts biweekly meeting notes:
- qx() entered a cold and dark zoom meeting, no one was to be found.
- Hello, hello? he said? no one answered....maybe his mic wasn't working.
- He rebooted his computer and charged the flux capacitor to no avail, he was alone.
- Alone and empty...

@Armeanio @mhs_sam please let us know how sigmanauts can help with utxo alliance operations. Currently feels like in those meetings its a bit hierarchical by necessity but if there are action items you want to delegate out I think that is a good place to start

 There are bandwidth issues that they need a community to fill


[11/30/2022 4:12 PM] Armeanio#0000
My perception


[11/30/2022 4:12 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Yes I think so. Having project core teams do this stuff doesn‚Äôt seem so effective


[11/30/2022 4:13 PM] Armeanio#0000
I keep getting pushed to take more responsibility but it makes sense to put people projects with a natural incentive in such roles because it makes their life and project more efficient vs less.

(re @NoahErgo : *but even with that said leveraging sigmanauts is always a good idea, I wanted to mention that at end of meeting but it wrapped up too quickly that if there are non-technical tasks we have people in our community available*) 
 
 what do you think about the creation of a group similar to Sigmanauts for the UTXO Alliance? would be great to find like-minds in those projects to collab with, help drive the alliance, things like that

or maybe a workgroup in the future in those breakout workgroups  based around ambassador-like programs for people in those communities to join - creating a bridge between all the project's ambassador programs essentially to learn from each other and see what's working and not working


[11/30/2022 6:02 PM] Armeanio#0000
I think if we push the merit/contribution driven approach that should open the dooor for such groups or DAO's


[11/30/2022 6:02 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Yes but i want to avoid fracturing


[11/30/2022 6:02 PM] dadreboi#0000
Sigmanauts are already starved a bit üôÇ would be more beneficial to pump them first imho


[11/30/2022 6:02 PM] dadreboi#0000

[11/30/2022 6:04 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I would like to lead utxo alliance working group within sigmanauts unless others feel inspired to do so


[11/30/2022 6:05 PM] dadreboi#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *I would like to lead utxo alliance working group within sigmanauts unless others feel inspired to do so*) 
 
 this feels not fragmented to me (thumbs up)


[11/30/2022 6:11 PM] crandano#0000
i see what you guys mean about fracturing/fragmenting. what i mean is more-so creating a breakout room based around ambassador programs where people from those other project's programs could join in and we can see how everyone is operating or give ideas to those that are working from square 1 on their program.

something i'm working out with SWARM (funded by Catalyst to help projects create proposals among other things) is creating a breakout room after the Catalyst Townhalls to do something similar to this (ie a place for ambassador programs / people thinking about governance/treasuries to come together to discuss where they're at, what they're thinking, give/discuss tips)

already in the SWARM meetings talking about Ergo i see a big interest brewing. with things like Rosen and Paidea coming these types of things could be really beneficial to spread awareness about interoperability and DAO solutions


[11/30/2022 6:13 PM] dadreboi#0000
so you mean Sigmanauts/Ergo sends and coordinates these breakouts after the town hall for more informal discussions with other projects?


[11/30/2022 6:16 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Something we discussed on the townhall is figuring out role of projects (not foundations) within the alliance. So i think my first plan was first establishing which projects on ergo would be interested here. Offhand i know azorus, rosen, but i know probably zengate, spectrum, paideia, aneta, blitz would all be interested as well


[11/30/2022 6:16 PM] NoahErgo#0000
is that kind of what you mean crandano ?


[11/30/2022 6:18 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Oddly i feel like cardano community is least involved in the alliance, currently its just iog so that feels like low hanging fruit for a place to get community involvement


[11/30/2022 6:19 PM] crandano#0000
(re @dadreboi : *so you mean Sigmanauts/Ergo sends and coordinates these breakouts after the town hall for more informal discussions with other projects?*) 
 
 anyone could come,  i'll definitely rep Ergo and discuss Sigmanauts. i'm also part of SingularityNET and do some stuff with SWARM. these breakout rooms typically have leaders taking initiative to drive the conversation. 

i'll work on a post soon for the governance/treasury workgroup in Sigmanauts. it all plays into it. learning what others are doing and what we can do to improve is a big part of it


[11/30/2022 6:20 PM] dadreboi#0000
u coming this sunday?


[11/30/2022 6:20 PM] dadreboi#0000
i'll put the discussion the agenda...you too @NoahErgo ? able to make it sun 2pm UTC?


[11/30/2022 6:22 PM] crandano#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *is that kind of what you mean crandano ?*) 
 
 i just mean it would be cool to get a conversation rolling with the UTXO Alliance projects where everyone's ambassador-like projects could meet every once in a while to discuss what they're doing and ideate best ways to move forward and catch up with each other. whether that's a future breakout room / workgroup like they discussed today or something on our own initiative


[11/30/2022 6:33 PM] NoahErgo#0000

What are your thoughts? Should I do it? Be genuine please

I think requesting payment for services is completely fair

Id also like to bring up while were talking about undistributed prizes, the ergo meetup NFTs were never sent out yet either.

I agree with Noah. Just be careful to navigate the difference to feeling entitled to get back things after giving. If you want to make something, make it with intent. If that intent is to charge a fee for a service, good. If it's to create something helpful with no strings attached, that's good too. If it's the latter that turns into the former (what you are proposing), cool. Just be clear to the people helping you along the way (with content and code) of what kind of service you are offering in the end üôÇ

 On this topic, we are ready to distribute rewards, all winners have been chosen and I have set up a twitter account to use Luivatras tipper bot to send rewards directly to the winning tweets. It took a long time to go through everything and find the winners. Also J the Ergod was my partner in this initiative and he became very busy with nightowl and life I suppose.

 @LuivatraEP might be able to give u their tipper bot address if u supply their Twitter ID to him (after you tip them a tiny bit first so it‚Äôs created).


[12/02/2022 12:05 PM] dadreboi#0000
Then u could send the nft to that without having to wait for them to get u their address.

Hello everybody,

We are posting this message here in our small community circle of highly trusted people and don't make this public for now. Please, don't let this info leak.

We are facing a compliance issue for the SPF token launch via Ergopad. We spoke with our lawyer, who warned us about the serious risks associated with the SEC (becoming unregistered security) when selling the SPF token without KYC process. Unfortunately, without KYC, we cannot organize a Public Sale on the Ergo blockchain.

We'd like to know you opinion about this situation. Could you answer the following questions and a short text with your opinion about KYC during SPF token sale of the Ergopad platform?

1. How do you feel about selling an SPF token with KYC?
2. How much will the presence of KYC affect your decision to buy an SPF token?
3. Is a detailed description of this issue with the reasons for making decisions important to you?

Your opinion is critical for us to make further decisions.

Thanks!


[12/06/2022 3:43 PM] LuivatraEP#0000
Would an ISPO be different legally? Because you basically sell tokens in exchange for ada?


[12/06/2022 3:44 PM] Frostyausty#0000
Thanks for telling us Yasha. It is okay. 

1. I understand. Certainly it‚Äôs not ideal but one of those situations where it is what it is. 

2. Probably it will have a decent affect as I foresee less people participating naturally, but maybe won‚Äôt have a huge effect. 

3. The explanation you gave is very transparent and think most people will understand the situation üëç


[12/06/2022 3:45 PM] yashablack#0000
(re @LuivatraEP : *Would an ISPO be different legally? Because you basically sell tokens in exchange for ada?*) 
 
 No regulations regarding ISPO for now, it will be most likely without KYC


[12/06/2022 3:46 PM] Armeanio#0000
I wouldn't think legally there is much difference between an ido or ispo other than 2 letters.


[12/06/2022 3:46 PM] Frostyausty#0000
(re @LuivatraEP : *Would an ISPO be different legally? Because you basically sell tokens in exchange for ada?*) 
 
 Think it‚Äôs a bit different because ADA is earned ‚Äúrandomly‚Äù (winning blocks) as opposed to directly selling tokens for other tokens


[12/06/2022 3:47 PM] yashablack#0000
(re @Frostyausty : *Think it‚Äôs a bit different because ADA is earned ‚Äúrandomly‚Äù (winning blocks) as opposed to directly selling tokens for other tokens*) 
 
 According our legal advise ISPO is ok to be held without KYC


[12/06/2022 3:47 PM] Armeanio#0000
The only difference is stake pools themselves probably are inheriting some potential liability.


[12/06/2022 3:48 PM] koutelier#0000
1.Since we are old in the ecosystem and we know the team i feel more conformable buying with KYC but new people i don't know if they are

2.If i know that my data are safe not so much, who is gonna KYC or how is gonna happen ?

3.The more description the best for people to understand why you choosing this path if you do so

 The ada is earned randomly, but then exchanged for a token. But then again, what do the lawmakers know :)

[12/06/2022 4:37 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Just a reminder: there are parts of the world not affected by US laws. So for many people it doesn't matter if it is a security or not


[12/06/2022 4:38 PM] yashablack#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *Possible to ‚Äúrequire‚Äù users to be in certain countries to participate and users must sign TOS to join*) 
 
 ToS is just a part of the history, but it‚Äôs not enough to not be considered as an unregistered security in the future. There are uncertain rules among all jurisdictions and regulators. We‚Äôd like to minimize long term risks.
Imagine how people will hate the project if no one CEX will list the token. Or if all the treasury of the dev team will be paid as a fine.


[12/06/2022 4:40 PM] yashablack#0000
(re @MrStahlfelge : *Just a reminder: there are parts of the world not affected by US laws. So for many people it doesn't matter if it is a security or not*) 
 
 But the team (and hence the project) is still affected. If the team/project/entity affected the community is affected. Pretty straightforward chain of reasoning. Our goal is always the community success and sustainability.

unpopular opinion: The only time I have a problem with KYC is when I'm declined without a reason why. Stripe did this to me.


[12/06/2022 9:12 PM] dadreboi#0000
sorry, just catching up....this is only for the sale, not for the trading of them after? ie: if someone wants SPF and no KYC they could swap on the dex with whatever LP was there (more expensive possibly)? @yashablack


[12/06/2022 11:20 PM] K#0000
Would structuring the IDO similarly to the sale of EFYT help prevent regulation as a security? If not, would that mean the EFYT was a security sale as well?


[12/06/2022 11:25 PM] glasgowm#9381
EFYT was airdropped, not sold.


[12/06/2022 11:26 PM] K#0000
I thought it said it "raised a small amount of funds" as well? Basing off this article: https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_05_20-curve/


[12/06/2022 11:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
Think it just means from trading/market-cap, never seen any mentioned other than the airdrop in the chats but before my time.

[12/07/2022 2:25 AM] Armeanio#0000
Interesting


[12/07/2022 2:25 AM] dadreboi#0000
so the 50k would go to placing ads in their search results/portal


[12/07/2022 2:26 AM] dadreboi#0000
doesn't brave have bat tokens that u get when u use it? or something like that? who here uses brave? this seems a little bit like a commercial version of brave perhaps at a shallow level?

Keyword advertising ‚Äî value $50,000
The ability to select keywords that are related to the project, and to have their ad displayed at the top of the search results when users enter those keywords. 

Site takeover ‚Äî value $45,000
The opportunity to ‚Äòtake over‚Äô as the daily sponsor of the site for 2 days. This includes prominent display of the advertiser‚Äôs logo at the top of Presearch along with a link to the project‚Äôs website.

[12/07/2022 2:33 AM] dadreboi#0000
Here is someones take on it (carl sagan baloney detection), sorry sorta off topic:

1. How reliable is the source of the claim?
2. Does this source often make similar claims?
3. Have the claims been verified by another source?
4. How does the claim fit with what we know about how the world works?
5. Has anyone gone out of the way to disprove the claim, or has only supportive evidence been sought?
6. Does the preponderance of evidence point to the claimant's conclusion or to a different one?
7. Is the claimant employing the accepted rules of reason and tools of research, or have these been abandoned in favor of others that lead to the desired conclusion?
8. Is the claimant providing an explanation for the observed phenomena or merely denying the existing explanation?
9. If the claimant proffers a new explanation, does it account for as many phenomena as the old explanation did?
10. Do the claimant's personal beliefs and biases drive the conclusions, or vice versa?

 yep, you allow ads if you want to. i feel like it gives you 2 ads (no images, just a pop up with text you can exit out of or go to the site it's advertising) per hour or something like that.

you can keep that off though. they have a built in wallet as well. also make it really easy to tip people like on YouTube or other sites or contribute to websites

20 mins in so far and he seems pretty genuine.


[12/07/2022 2:59 AM] dadreboi#0000
unless it takes a turn for the worse it seems ok and he seems like he has a good vision of what he's doing...he wants to make money of ads for sure, he's not shy about that, but other than that he hopes to be able to curate an index up to the level of googles but it's a stepping process, for now he's using other's of course and working on building an index of common searches.


[12/07/2022 3:01 AM] dadreboi#0000
you can check out the search engine without any signups <https://presearch.com/>


[12/07/2022 3:23 AM] dadreboi#0000
45 mins in.....i can see why people in this sphere might not like this tho...not for everyone. a lof ot this so far is talking about how to deliver ads and sponsor. nothing wrong with that, ads are just not everyones cup of tea.


[12/07/2022 3:28 AM] dadreboi#0000
so in short, you use the tokens to stake search result keywords....so i could stake XX tokens to take the "crypto" keyword and pop in something curated about ergo in the search results.


[12/07/2022 3:30 AM] dadreboi#0000
guess that means we can stake any keyword and have some results show...so the more money the more they can "own" the results....just like real advertising.

One feature I suggested was having an "easy mode". I think Eternl tx history does this perfectly, just type in a wallet address and get a list like this that any user will be able to follow without knowing anything about UTXO. It can then be expanded to get more advanced details such as boxes used and ID's and what addresses boxes were sent to.

Ergo Raffle
Ergo raffle is a crowdfunding system based on ergo contracts

(re @Gazza_SP : *One feature I suggested was having an "easy mode". I think Eternl tx history does this perfectly, just type in a wallet address and get a list like this that any user will be able to follow without knowing anything about UTXO. It can then be expanded to get more advanced details such as boxes used and ID's and what addresses boxes were sent to.*) 
 
 Looks like what wallet app shows, or is there a difference I don't see?


[12/08/2022 9:10 AM] Gazza_SP#0000

 I was just confused because you used a wallet from another ecosystem as an example, thought there is some twist we should adopt

before you make another one, I would recommend assigning a higher percentage to the winner. Collecting 15k erg with only 1 percent to winner is not straightforward.


[12/08/2022 9:49 AM] Gstoiti#0000
Also, I would think about splitting it into multiple parts with smaller tasks (if feasible). Probably easier to get 5k, then deliver a feature and ask for another 10k than to collect 15k at once.

If you do that, then put in the description that there will be more raffles.


[12/08/2022 9:52 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
especially since this does not deliver any features to the end users, but some figma stuff to be handed over to explorer devs.

 Agree, i had to learn that part ... There is no comparison between what ergcube and what you are  doing ...but seeing how to Industry and knowing how I got funded those 200 erg (thanks to most of core) ..community won't be supporting much in things like this ...unless you make it interesting and a fun gamble or maybe combine raffle with Spf some how where you airdrop amount of Spf to every contributer to the raffle

 We don‚Äôt want to use it like you proposed. Currently we just have some time and free hands to improve smth in the ecosystem. If there is no demand, we can always find ways to focus on smth else.
The ruffle is the simplest way to understand whether there is demand for a product/improvements or not.

 I use OBS studio for the stream itself, it's open source and free, and much more powerful than streamyard. Zoom is just how we do the video call element. But we could do any kind of other video call like Skype, Google meet, etc, and still run the stream

From Facebook:

 "An important milestone for The Open Network, Telegram and the entire decentralized world: the Telegram messaging service team has launched the sale of virtual numbers with the prefix +888 placed as collectibles on the TON blockchain.

 These numbers cannot be used to call or register for third-party services, but allow users to create anonymous Telegram accounts.

 Now everyone can log in using the anonymous numbers based on the TON blockchain available on the Fragment platform and benefit from maximum privacy.

 Purchased numbers can be kept in a normal TON wallet, transferred to other users and put up for sale on the markets, just like any other TON NFT." 


Is there a way to do it on ergo? As ergonames or something?  This could be a nice way to gather mor people!

 In order to connect with ergo number the social media platform or whatever will have to allow that. This is why for now Ton numbers are only supported on telegram

 Telegram systems are built on the assumption of a phone nr being there. Making this system was probably easier than refactoring everything. They could easily have made this service for free with fake numbers under the hood but that would be scammer heaven, so this way they earn some money as well

(re @yashablack : *ToS is just a part of the history, but it‚Äôs not enough to not be considered as an unregistered security in the future. There are uncertain rules among all jurisdictions and regulators. We‚Äôd like to minimize long term risks.
Imagine how people will hate the project if no one CEX will list the token. Or if all the treasury of the dev team will be paid as a fine.*) 
 
 Just imagine how people will hate the project if their personal data will be leaked or misused, and that happens all the time btw.

 Thanks for reminding us one more time. The skin is on the line, we work out the best solution together with the community.


[12/10/2022 12:20 PM] kushti#0000
@yashablack what if your lawyer will tell you that trading must be kyced as well according to ofac rules? Or if ofac will block some addresses like happened in Eth?

(re @kushti_ru : *@yashablack what if your lawyer will tell you that trading must be kyced as well according to ofac rules? Or if ofac will block some addresses like happened in Eth?*) 
 
 I am involved in one project that is failing due to self-overregulation.

They issued ETH tokens and were so afraid of regulators that they built their own full KYCed exchange only to trade their own token vs ETH.

As expected after 5 years lots of dev resources wasted. Token has no liquidity on their own exchange and project perspectives look bad.


[12/10/2022 12:58 PM] justin1000#0000
Seems odd to bend over backwards to comply with OFAC and expect a law firm‚Äôs opinion to protect you from them. Suppose in crypto they can come after whoever they feel like and change rules whenever. Sets a bad precedent if that is the motivation especially for a dex. But on the other hand, if this is strictly about needing a legal opinion stating you are not a unregistered security to list on top exchanges and this is the only way to get it, maybe it is necessary. Need to make sure you are getting good legal advice and check what other big projects are doing. I would also make certain they are going to give you that opinion, exchanges will accept it (have exchanges accepted their opinions in the past?) and you have clear answers about all other methods of token distribution like ISPO etc so they don‚Äôt pull any surprises on you and ask you to KYC that too! Else, you may quickly end up getting into over regulation like Richi is warning.


[12/10/2022 12:59 PM] justin1000#0000
Anyway, that specific reason MIGHT be valid to require KYC on this offering in my opinion (however distasteful), afterall it is only a portion of your total fund raising and if you believe top listings on CEXes is required for you then hard to jeapardize that.


[12/10/2022 3:57 PM] oskin#0000
(re @kushti_ru : *@yashablack what if your lawyer will tell you that trading must be kyced as well according to ofac rules? Or if ofac will block some addresses like happened in Eth?*) 
 
 Well, that‚Äôs always about tradeoffs between the value that the service is supposed to provide to users and fitting into existing regulations. 
In this particular case the question that we‚Äôre currently discussing with the community is whether KYC on one of the distribution channels (only direct sale via ergopad, those who don‚Äôt want to opt-in into kyc will still be able to buy another way) is an acceptable tradeoff for clearing the way for the token to exchanges. Again, as Justin just noted, on our side we should make sure that this level of ‚Äúcompliance‚Äù provides feasible guarantees.


[12/10/2022 4:03 PM] oskin#0000

 Self over-regulation is certainly a risk, but that‚Äôs exactly why we are checking with the community before making any decision

damn, i wonder what the threshold was for them to be profitable? i wonder if it's a lot more than it currently is or if it would have been possible to drive awareness again for a month or so to make them profitable


[12/11/2022 3:34 AM] justin1000#0000
I think in general it is inevitable for these type of things to happen with the price being so low and Ergo being so tremendously undervalued relative to much less promising blockchains. And I am sure the non-visible impact from this situation (delayed projects, ppl working part-time etc) is much greater than the visible ones like this announcement.

So we all have to continue to try and address the price and liquidity issue so people can build profitable businesses on Ergo and dedicate themselves to it full-time.

I wouldn‚Äôt overreact to this though. Crypto is just really volatile, market very inefficient and everyone working in it needs to be ready to accept that. I think Ergo community probably much stronger in these circumstances than most. And as soon as price and excitement comes back, should see a quick rebound in project and business activity on Ergo.

(re @crandano : *damn, i wonder what the threshold was for them to be profitable? i wonder if it's a lot more than it currently is or if it would have been possible to drive awareness again for a month or so to make them profitable*) 
 
 It was a lot. Several thousands of dollars per month.  Unfortunately when we began market conditions were much different.   With less than 1% of the hashrate it was too far of a reach to break even.


[12/11/2022 9:38 AM] HQ3rr#0000
would any of the foundation member like to attend the sigmanaut meeting today?
 we should act quickly and properly after getblok quiting , i know that there main reason of quiting is the current state of crypto and also money flow .
What we learn from this loose?  potencial flows we should consider on working.
-Maybe creat some internal marketing funds for projects who are really an Innovation not only for ergo but for whole crypto space , give maximum attention to people who are putting there skin and money in project for ergo and that's minimum we can do for them .
-We are missing the marketing just because of "money" and it's painfull to see projects quiting... 
My 1 love = 2 cents

How did we lose an opportunity? Was pushed quite a bit.


[12/11/2022 11:09 AM] koutelier#0000
So in case i am not make it to the meeting. I will just bring this up , no hate to anyone just things that most of us discuss between us. First if you want to call EF decentralized. You need a burn dao that will allow ALL erg holders not just miners because ergo is much more than miners to vote on certain things. EF members or other entities can create issues/questions. The ergs won't get burn but will go back to miners with storage rent. Second i see sigmanauts do a lot of work for free , i believe they should paid for the work that is supposed to be done by other members of EF that get paid to do it. Last but not least EF needs to check who hires and for what , and if after certain amount of time they or the community sees they are not suitable for the position they should fire and hire someone better. Also if you like transparency and decentralization EF should show numbers to the community members as well. Some things can't be on a dao like nda about listing that understood but most of things can be. If you want power to the community this is how you will deliver it in a safe way imo.


[12/11/2022 11:09 AM] koutelier#0000
i hope this won't bring any hate. Just things we all discuss between us some times , it's not for someone specific just in general

 I dont think any projects on Ergo are lacking community support, within the ergo ecosystem they were fairly well known for anyone paying attention (many miners dont engage with community at all and are unreachable). Problem is miners weren‚Äôt convinced enough to move sure - but not such a simple problem to solve.

 Wdym by burn DAO? Theres a possibility of user-activated soft-forks too on-chain but sounds like you‚Äôre conflating it with the treasury. This was originally planned with ergofund but other infrastructure took priority. EF does also constantly review who we‚Äôre paying btw.

 A dao when erg holders vote by giving away ergs. 1 erg = 1 vote for example. Those ergs can't be burned but they go back to miners with rent storage , this can make ergo minable forever lol so for example erg holders see that kushti is a lazy dev , doesn't do anything for the ecosystem and doesn't develop. Also EF members notice that so they create an issue . `do we fire kushti ?` community votes then EF fires. also you may want to run a marketing campaign but you want to ask the community for their opinion if EF should spent money to it or not. Although those things should be handle by professionals if you want to make it decentralized this is the way. You open everything to the community (roles,payments,tasks) and let them decide what to do with treasury and how to pay or not . Issues can be created by trusted people that hold an nft , that nft can be transferred to new people when they don't feel like being in the ecosystem for any reason.


[12/11/2022 11:43 AM] koutelier#0000
I bring the dao here as a solution because you want EF decentralized . or else i propose the EF to review who and how much they pay members or people that work for EF, cut salaries or fire if they don't deliver or they are not match the requirements and create task for people that are willing to help more and then hire new people like sigmanauts or other community members or not community members. if you deliver you get paid if not the task can be assigned to someone else. 

Again i bring this up because more and more often i get to hear that EF in some areas is like being runned by amateurs. I don't personally hate or accuse anyone , we all want ergo to succeed so i bring this up so you all are aware. People usually don't talk about those things but i can't help my self to be straight forward to people i know for a long time and to a project that i have spent a great amount of time

(re @koutelier : *I bring the dao here as a solution because you want EF decentralized . or else i propose the EF to review who and how much they pay members or people that work for EF, cut salaries or fire if they don't deliver or they are not match the requirements and create task for people that are willing to help more and then hire new people like sigmanauts or other community members or not community members. if you deliver you get paid if not the task can be assigned to someone else.

 How should I know if you do it or not ? Or how the community can know ?


[12/11/2022 11:50 AM] glasgowm#0000
It would be the default unless you had any particular concerns? How would you like to know? Dont know if I agree if those kinds of things should be public - are they public anywhere else?

 I‚Äôm know EF has small % to manage this is why it needs to be done in the best possible way. I don‚Äôt accuse anyone.

 Well EF is promoting decentralization and the end goal is to give power to the community . So if you want to achieve that then you have to go public with your community I believe

About to sleep a bit before the meeting and there‚Äôs things I want to reply to. Good conversation.

Not sure a burn DAO would work just throwing it out there you want people to burn ERG for a vote and it ends up going to miners? Sounds like people with a lot of money would have a lot of control. But maybe you need to elaborate more or I need to think with a more clear head. 

I do wonder what EF spends on marketing per month / what the budget looks like there. Is that available? 

Will follow up later. Goodnight


[12/11/2022 11:54 AM] glasgowm#0000
Was at $20k/month - but got cut recently I believe with price. And things like marketing demands from exchanges are a multiple of that so sometimes a lot more

 EF is already community-ran technically, the tokenomics are what make it decentralised. Unless we get a huge pump and tons of tokens donated then it‚Äôll fizzle out and support decentralistion that way.

 Does EF Tracks everything ? Do you have a dashboard with analytics on how much devs/members and people that work for EF get payed and what everyone does ?


[12/11/2022 12:00 PM] glasgowm#0000
Yep but work done is mostly by performance monitored by their managers or in dev chat.


[12/11/2022 12:02 PM] koutelier#0000
Well I believe EF should start keeping better track . Setting certain goals in all areas (marketing /dev) and see how much each member /dev delivers


[12/11/2022 12:03 PM] koutelier#0000
I had the opportunity to work with spectrum guys and they have a pretty decent way of keeping track / assign tasks and all .

(re @koutelier : *Well I believe EF should start keeping better track . Setting certain goals in all areas (marketing /dev) and see how much each member /dev delivers*) 
 
 Continous process sir, very few people getting paid and for varied roles. We‚Äôve been trying to get more devs on timesheets recently but then who checks them? Few small self-managed teams (rust, bridges, etc) with autonomy; and the remaining people have vastly different goals.

 Would be good to see more details on burn DAO. On other issues raised, I very much agree.

With growing ecosystem maybe it makes sense to establish Ergo Association, and put EF (along with sigmanauts) only on non-profit matters, and pass control over treasury spendings to Association mostly

 Who checks them? EF , or the lead of the specific area .


[12/11/2022 12:12 PM] HQ3rr#0000
These are key questions that we as sigmanaut should know, to know why and what we are lacking at... Too me it's not funds issues , because we are focusing on other aspects of marketing and not taking advantage of daily basis marketing stuff


[12/11/2022 12:13 PM] kushti#0000
Originally, me and catena thought that control must be split between miners, users (ordinary ones) and significant ecosystem players. And unlike the launch moment, not we have the third part.

Technically, PoW chain is controlled by miners. But in reality miners are following community (or developers) decisions most of the time.

 What we should do is , maybe creat a "sigmanut core " of people who we really know and what they are good at ... And creat few more rules under ...core assigns tasks...by doing this we are giving EF relief on certain parts

(re @glasgowm : *no just a budget*) 
 
 Curious on salary as well and a breakdown of how the budget is spent (ie November could be an example). I‚Äôm sure a lot goes on with the $20K and it would be nice to see how it‚Äôs broken down and people could give suggestions knowing the total marketing budget along with how it‚Äôs utilized

 First step is to record everything and review everyone . Since the % of money EF has is small and since us the only thing that keeps ergo active on development we all need to make sure money is well spent . If EF struggles to keep track this is the part we should start


[12/11/2022 12:17 PM] koutelier#0000

 This is not a job for one person.

 Maybe it is the wrong word, it is named controller here. Someone looking at the expenses and what they earned back. Then talking with the people responsible if there's a problem and giving advice.


[12/11/2022 12:21 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
(re @koutelier : *Well I don‚Äôt know if one person has the knowledge to evaluate everyone.*) 
 
 That's why the job usually has a lot of meetings involved. You have to talk to stakeholders


[12/11/2022 12:21 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
And the controller does not fire and hire but only gives advise to the decision makers. Which is the boss or the board in normal companies


[12/11/2022 12:21 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
And the boss still can talk to the stakeholders and form another opinion.

 EF is not decentralized atm . And shouldn‚Äôt be imo . It needs better management imo


[12/11/2022 12:23 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
A boss is usually not decentralized. If the decision making is decentralized here, it is. To form an opinion about the value of someone's work, I have the opinion that someone really getting into it might be better than a team. Because sometimes a team falls to very short sighted decisions because no team member spends enough time to look into details

EF needs strong CEO for growth. This is centralisation, but evolution doesn‚Äôt work in an opposite direction. Centralisation may come to decetralisation with right management. Otherwise we will observe Brownian motion, which is entropy in its essence.

 It will not work fine, coz each ecosystem part should know what to do consistently to reach community goals and not do what is not needed.
Doing needs time, if you do wrong things which will not lead to any results - you learn, but not achieve.

 One thing should be kept in mind that Marty mentioned when talking about getting through a bear: not everyone can accept reduced hours or hire and fire lifestyle. If you set some people back in the hours they got paid, they might be forced to get another job and you'll completely loose them.

If you set some people back in the hours they got paid, they might be forced to get another job and you'll completely loose them.
All these dependencies need to be kept in mind by a good controller*) 
 
 One thing to keep in mind as well is that there is a world crisis . When things goes rough salaries reduced in order to sustain your business . If you keep paying money you don‚Äôt have sooner or later you will left with no money.
Also in crisis more employers are Available duo to this. I am not saying reduce money for people that work and deliver

But if someone is paying full time and just working part time needs to get payed for part time

In the future you could use the Paideia DAO for managing the Marketing budget or the Foundation


[12/11/2022 12:58 PM] Tefcek21#0000
and please keep in mind that anyone who is into marketing knows that in this time it is really hard to get good conversion rates. What I do support is that marketing wise you might need for some new stuff, and replace the stuff which is not working. 

And the best way to do that, is firstly have a good Organisation, scheduled agenda, scheduled posts and so on.

 I don't think so. Paideia won't have that much expensive fees, and I'm not sure if it's possible to make exceptions but that can be discussed. 

I would love the fact that EF makes use of Paideia, and while doing that supporting a project trying to build a great tool for it's community and ecosystem.


[12/11/2022 1:06 PM] Tefcek21#0000
Nothing set in stone yet, but this is a proposal on Paideia that still has to be discussed and voted on.

 Well I am not even part of EF . This is just my opinion lol . Support off course can come with or without using paideia as EF .

The dao probably for such an entity will have to be special so in your end you will have to do some development if this is what EF will do . But this is long way imo since a lot of things need to be discuss before that.

Doesnt make sense to say EF is not transparent enough on the inner workings/management and at the same time saying the inner workings/management need to be done better.


[12/11/2022 2:12 PM] dadreboi#0000
Interesting conversation in the wee hours. My 2c

This may be from becoming a motherless child early on in my life, but I believe, especially in this case, that recognition comes from within and from the community. If you can‚Äôt recognize your own value then no amount of praise or monies from others will satisfy that. We don‚Äôt need the EF to be our parents. We don‚Äôt need someONE to look up to to give validation when something goes right. 

If I died tomorrow I‚Äôve left nothing secret so that someone or group could easily pick up the pen and continue forward. 

In fact, if someone with more time comes along and starts doing what I‚Äôm doing better, they have the freedom to share that pen, or also pick it up, or fork the effort if there isn‚Äôt consensus. 

We preach open source, open source, and enjoy software that has been released this way yet at the same time sometimes seek ways for only a subset of efforts to be recognized. We can‚Äôt eat our cake and have it too. 

It‚Äôs natural to idolize or to feel like you need a leader. That‚Äôs why Ergo feels strange to some. Granted, there are some things leaders will give benefit for, listings, legal dealings, motivation‚Ä¶but that can also be solved by a sub group with transparency and votes to back up the decisions. There are 3rd party legal options to explore. 

Leaving ergo in the hands of the community will be hard, as we are seeing now, but with good principals and a solid framework it can be built to withstand what other groups with a single figurehead cannot. The EF has done so much work getting it this far already and that should not be taken lightly by the community. 

I see ergo as a community run project with a voting board that is held accountable not by themselves, but by the people who they represent. If people want to see leaders in that, it‚Äôs prob unavoidable.

In the end, I think we are on the right track for the future of ergo  <clipped message>

The ETC business illustrates part of the problem with the EF. I still don't know the constraints involved in that decision. I do know there was zero community discussion about it beforehand, and it wasn't a good look. I'd like a whole lot less of that. This is not to negate all the good work EF has done, but I use it to illustrate the issue of concentrating decision-making.


[12/11/2022 3:59 PM] Gstoiti#0000
(re @MrStahlfelge : *Maybe it is the wrong word, it is named controller here. Someone looking at the expenses and what they earned back. Then talking with the people responsible if there's a problem and giving advice.*) 
 
 People outside of German speaking countries know this position/department probably under the name of management accounting. Like you said, someone who keeps track of the budget (and tasks), but to support management and decision making and not for external needs (like financial accounting does with financial reports for investors/regulators).

Part of that job is to create/discuss and review decisions, performance measures and compensation contracts to align the goals of employees with the goals of the company. Especially with a tight budget, every spending decision affects each department. If we spend more for marketing, we have less for development. The problem is that one needs the reports of specialists (like dev team leaders or marketing team leaders) about benefits and costs of investments to choose how to allocate funds. However, usually every team thinks that they need more money for their area and there is the risk of overestimating benefits or underreporting costs. Hence, one needs to align the goals of the team leaders with the goals of the company. It's all game theory (under the constraint of keeping employees happy) in the end. 

I have no idea how the Ergo Foundation works and allocates funds. I guess someone is doing that already.

(re @Tefcek21 : *In the future you could use the Paideia DAO for managing the Marketing budget or the Foundation*) 
 
 agreed, Marketing for Ergo could likely be a DAO. and i think we are seeking a bit more transparency from EF as we're curious on how it operates - this is beneficial for the Sigmanauts Program as we are laying out the groundwork for how it operates.

I think for Marketing it would be nice to see how that budget (~$20K/mo, before salaries for marketing within EF) was utilized in November as an example would be nice


[12/11/2022 4:35 PM] crandano#0000
and hopefully it's obvious that there's a massive appreciation for EF. I'm sure there's a lot going on in the background and it would be cool to get some insight.

 i'm interested in this to know where Sigmanauts stand in the future. what is the normal month of marketing for EF? it would be great information to have

Forwarded from Tefcek21: Most of the media's attention goes to centralized projects that aren't open source or transparent, even though these projects tend to be the least useful and valuable.

Even though Ergo and Cardano are becoming more important, they haven't gotten the attention they deserve.

Instead of focusing on rug pulls, fake news, and centralized projects that don't add much value, shift your focus to projects that are decentralized, open-source, and transparent.

‚ö†Ô∏èWe want everyone in the Ergo ecosystem to support this post so that the media and the general public will pay more attention to projects that deserve it.üßë‚ÄçüöÄ

 Paying miners beyond the protocol rewards?

 Storage rent

1 erg = 1 vote


[12/11/2022 7:52 PM] koutelier#0000
That way erg can be mineable forever and also everyone has voice not just miners. This also supports miners since they are the life of the blockchain(by life I mean without miners no network)


[12/11/2022 7:52 PM] Armeanio#0000

OR however you want to call it in the future


[12/11/2022 7:55 PM] Armeanio#0000

 Storage rent is a miner subsidy.

[12/11/2022 9:26 PM] CW#0000
The heavy lifting of ecosystem marketing needs to come from the projects building on Ergo themselves. Promote their good and services, the benefits of using their product whether for business or fun etc. EF is promoting the protocol and features of the protocol, education, development and what not. 

There is limited funding and bandwidth of the EF. I for one as director of marketing have had to be extremely frugal with accepting offers or collabs from partners due to market conditions.

A lot of assumptions and speculation is being thrown around some warranted, some absurd. There is a budget, there is management of funds, there are numerous reviews of outgoings across the board.

When I joined the EF as a non voting member i reviewed the marketing budget. As @glasgowm mentioned there is technically $20k a month for operational marketing, this is to include listings, EF events, partner events, PRs etc. Its a stretch to say 10-15% of that is currently utilized (rest unspent) to pay for editorial writings and subscription services for Notion, Discord/TG services (bots etc).

Regarding marketing salaries im happy to discuss mine but not at liberty to discuss my teams members. a quick glance and the total marketing salary is 10% of monthly EF total salaries. 

The purse strings are tight, price is shit and we're in a bear market.

I understand the CW part, we have given you the tools, you raise your baby's on ur own and if help is needed they will help with day caring but you are the parents


[12/11/2022 9:48 PM] dadreboi#0000
(re @koutelier : *sir you joined yesterday . more and more people are getting inactive or leaving after a certain amount of time if they don't get paid from a project or from another source of income . You can't ask for people to dedicate so much time on this for free when others getting paid for it. especially in this market.*) 
 
 but i do understand what you're saying Koutelier. We need to figure this out.


[12/11/2022 9:49 PM] dadreboi#0000
can't expect everyone to run on hugs and /t 10 love


[12/11/2022 9:50 PM] Tefcek21#0000
For example I know that Armeanio is working a lot behind the scenes doing all the work with exchanges, listing and other stuff which I really appreciate and he is doing an amazing work which works out nice, so thats something that I wouldn't change. However on the other side I think the media coverage is not handled well, in terms of catching attention and farming engagement outside the ecosystem, that would be something that has to be changed.


[12/11/2022 9:50 PM] Armeanio#0000
One thing I would like to see is more independence from projects in terms of marketing.


[12/11/2022 9:50 PM] Armeanio#0000
Why am I making more content than all the projects combined?


[12/11/2022 9:51 PM] Armeanio#0000
Videos etc would be nice to see more even from projects not just the sigmanauts.


[12/11/2022 9:51 PM] Tefcek21#0000
See Charles - he keeps attacking and catching up on hot topics by mentioning Cardano. Do the same and see how it works out.


[12/11/2022 9:51 PM] Armeanio#0000
This is not something sustainable long term imo. Projects need to step up there.


[12/11/2022 9:52 PM] Tefcek21#0000
(re @Armeanio : *One thing I would like to see is more independence from projects in terms of marketing.*) 
 
 Well on our side as ErgoPad and Paideia I would say that we are doing a lot in terms of social media presence, networking and so on. However we don't have a 20k budget and a limited amount of people who are working behind the scenes.


[12/11/2022 9:52 PM] Armeanio#0000
The Cardano Foundation isnt marketing for projects.


[12/11/2022 9:53 PM] Armeanio#0000
There is more independence which is good I think.


[12/11/2022 9:53 PM] koutelier#0000
projects can go much further if ergo is unknown/unreachable , not listed to big cex and has the marketing power. i would prefer to know ergo first and then the tokens of ergo personally.

 Technically correct in favorable market conditions. see my post above


[12/11/2022 9:54 PM] Armeanio#0000
(re @koutelier : *projects can go much further if ergo is unknown/unreachable , not listed to big cex and has the marketing power. i would prefer to know ergo first and then the tokens of ergo personally.*) 
 
 That's just a matter of cost and exchange priorities mostly.


[12/11/2022 9:54 PM] Tefcek21#0000
Okay then say if the EF is not about the marketing, who is responsible for that? Who makes sure that Ergo gets media coverage, how people will find out about Ergo?


[12/11/2022 9:54 PM] koutelier#0000
or passing a mindset that erg is a sidechain on social medias .


[12/11/2022 9:54 PM] dadreboi#0000
(re @Tefcek21 : *Okay then say if the EF is not about the marketing, who is responsible for that? Who makes sure that Ergo gets media coverage, how people will find out about Ergo?*) 
 
 The community and the projects.


[12/11/2022 9:55 PM] Tefcek21#0000
(re @dadreboi : *The community and the projects.*) 
 
 Okay and how do you expect the community to expand, the projects to collect funds to do marketing and that more developers join?


[12/11/2022 9:55 PM] dadreboi#0000
i think projects should be conceptualized and planned with a healthy marketing plan in place


[12/11/2022 9:55 PM] HQ3rr#0000
(re @Tefcek21 : *Okay and how do you expect the community to expand, the projects to collect funds to do marketing and that more developers join?*) 
 
 SIMPLE question, will the projects share there rewards with ef ?


[12/11/2022 9:56 PM] koutelier#0000
we have only one dex and we lack on promoting it. if this project dies all ergo projects dies and probably ergo itself. you can't expect just from projects to market ergo. i think armeanio you are asking projects to market ergo . projects should market their selves


[12/11/2022 9:56 PM] Armeanio#0000
(re @koutelier : *or passing a mindset that erg is a sidechain on social medias .*) 
 
 You have 3000 SPOs pounding the drum to get stake. Making content.


[12/11/2022 9:56 PM] Armeanio#0000
Videos socials etc.


[12/11/2022 9:56 PM] Tefcek21#0000
(re @dadreboi : *i think projects should be conceptualized and planned with a healthy marketing plan in place*) 
 
 How? Without funds and enough resources?


[12/11/2022 9:56 PM] CW#0000
word of mouth, likes, retweets, coining conversations, social movements. guerilla marketing has always been a focus of ergo


[12/11/2022 9:57 PM] CW#0000
or we can pay 10-40k for a crypto media PR.


[12/11/2022 9:57 PM] Armeanio#0000
(re @Armeanio : *You have 3000 SPOs pounding the drum to get stake. Making content.*) 
 
 We have like 2 sources of content.


[12/11/2022 9:57 PM] Armeanio#0000
Consistent content anyway.


[12/11/2022 9:57 PM] Armeanio#0000
Now 3 with Sigma Update üî•


[12/11/2022 9:57 PM] koutelier#0000
what those lend to?


[12/11/2022 9:58 PM] CW#0000
education, awareness, promotion

(re @seedubya : *word of mouth, likes, retweets, coining conversations, social movements. guerilla marketing has always been a focus of ergo*) 
 
 I don't think that this is enough by far. Maybe an unpopular opinion.


[12/11/2022 9:58 PM] koutelier#0000
dev update and sigma update is pretty similar so far . only members of the ecosystem watch


[12/11/2022 9:58 PM] koutelier#0000
whats the point of content if it doesn't bring new people ?


[12/11/2022 9:59 PM] HQ3rr#0000
(re @koutelier : *dev update and sigma update is pretty similar so far . only members of the ecosystem watch*) 
 
 i am planning to change that, wil ldrop each day a update on projects in easy infographics


[12/11/2022 9:59 PM] HQ3rr#0000
from the dev update


[12/11/2022 9:59 PM] Armeanio#0000
Ergo platform youtube, proof of ergo, and sigma. I guess Blitz has done pretty well too.


[12/11/2022 10:00 PM] HQ3rr#0000
and i am working alone. (i feel frustrated too when i ask for a simple , what is sigusd article and no one can write that for the community ot why use cold wallets when we were having a nice moment of sharing these things)


[12/11/2022 10:00 PM] CW#0000
(re @koutelier : *dev update and sigma update is pretty similar so far . only members of the ecosystem watch*) 
 
 provides confidence to the community to show activity. community members can cut that info into short clips, like retweet, comment, jump into other influencer channels, comment, discuss, set up non paid interviews with influencers


[12/11/2022 10:00 PM] HQ3rr#0000
but i suck it up, and i continue


[12/11/2022 10:01 PM] Tefcek21#0000
And also to all those who are running a project, support others projects too. Thats really important. 

ZenGate introduced their projects and made a really really huge partnership, I would love to see all projects doing at least a RT.

[12/11/2022 10:01 PM] koutelier#0000

and sorry if i am being to verbal here, sometimes you have to gamble by giving to the community and you might get more back.. , i would love to see projects to give and not only take too


[12/11/2022 10:03 PM] CW#0000
(re @Tefcek21 : *I know but what about the other I don't know 30-40 projects?*)

[12/11/2022 10:03 PM] koutelier#0000
maybe it's just me but i don't see a marketing plan. Rather  than creating dev updates , and creating AMa's. What is the long term or short term marketing plan ? like what will happen in the next year or so. what are the goals, how you will achieve those goals. What will happen if sigmanauts disappear is EF capable of continuing marketing


[12/11/2022 10:04 PM] HQ3rr#0000
the bussiness i know is , you give free drink and make a better and loyal client . not sure if crypto is same , which i think it is.


[12/11/2022 10:04 PM] koutelier#0000

I know that we had these discussions a couple times, just wanted to share my thoughts one more time here. 

If you think that me as the Paideia and ErgoPad marketing lead that I should do something different in terms of marketing our own platform and the Ergo ecosystem, I welcome everyone to share there feedback and suggestions with me so I can do our part to support everyone here better.


[12/11/2022 10:07 PM] CW#0000

 Well, responding to the tag on Discord asking you to amend the ergopad section(s) on the slides would‚Äôve been helpful - and having these discussions in a structured, productive way on the sigmanauts forum on Discord would be a good start. Many of the concerns raised today are precisely why it was created, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very productive or appropriate here.

 In terms of Paideia we're planing to go cross-chain so we are preparing our project to introduce it to the Cardano folks. While we are doing this we plan to onboard people from Cardano to Ergo and from Ergo to Cardano. 

I don't know if I am allowed to share more, so I will leave it here.

[12/11/2022 10:22 PM] dadreboi#0000
we aren't that far yet, the hope is that people interested in supporting and furthering the community will initially join...then together, we can figure out how to best tackle this collectivly.

I read something about EF funding sigmanauts or community helpers etc.

I think it is a great idea but I also think only a few people deserve funding, there are some people who claim to deserve something in return for what they do for the community but I don't think it is really worth it, imo yes EF should "gift" some people something in return, but there should be someone that takes care of deciding who really deserves something in return and who doesn't.

Noah, qx, cw are the ones that I see ALWAYS actually providing useful things for the ecosystem, those should be offered something in return (maybe they already have, I have no clue)

There are some others who seems like hey they are somewhat helpful at some points we could offer them a small amount and lets see how this amount makes them behave, they beg for more, they work even harder, they keep doing exactly the same, and then after one month decide whether to stop giving them gifts for what they do or not.

As an example I will provide one that I lived myself a year ago or so, Jos√© and I were taking care of the spanish community, not a hard task.

But jos√© even did some AMAs, I think if I was the EF I would have seen there an opportunity to offer him a monthly gift if he took care of those kind of deals and kept dealing with the spanish community while adding some new tasks such as looking some new possible interviews in spanish youtube channels, or amas, or write media content in spanish etc etc.

Similar thing happened with me, I was also dealing with the spanish community but most of my helpful input was in translations, I think if I was the EF once again I would have offered some kind of monthly gifts, to keep me motivated, hey after all this guy is litterally bringing every post to any spanish speaker person. ( I did get some sigUSD from deadit üíö) 

Maybe after taking those decisions Jos√© could have become a spanish community manage <clipped message>

this can be a potential issues with such a large group and potentially providing sensitive information. leaks, front running announcements, potential delays after such announcements made etc. 

these are considerations the projects need to make when handling and scheduling announcements, making info known prior etc


[12/11/2022 11:59 PM] dann#0000
TL;DR
I suggest to have one trustworthy and active person with a certain amount of funds to decide who to give those funds each month, to try and keep motivation of those whose work is hard and is paying off.

The same person will have to decide when to stop giving those funds to a certain person if for whatever reason it isn't working out as expected.

Not really a fan of the gift concept. But, if you were going to do it, I think one approach is to give a lot of people a small amount and tell them to pass it on to the person that they saw being the most helpful this month, or whatever period. Personally, I think this is more properly in a whale or community fund territory, if done at all. It's not something EF should be doing, but YMMV.

 Dont think this kind of be generous if you see somebody helping doesnt work, reality is that a new sigmanaut joins and wants to help and wants to provide new ideas etc, but at the end of the day if there is nothing rewarding you at the end of the month, the sigmanaut will lose motivation fast


[12/12/2022 12:34 AM] dann#0000
Hey sigmanaut, looks like what u do is helpful, here is the offer, monthly payment.

At the end of the month maybe the ef member notices that sigmanaut work isnt helping, and either he continues doing that thing for free or receiving less, and same way around, if sigmanauts feels like he is bringing a lot of value, he can ask for more, if he doesnt receive he can do whatever he wants to do


[12/12/2022 12:36 AM] cafebedouin#9837
I've been here a year. If anything, I'm more involved. Most things I do aren't public facing. It can also get into bad feelings. For example, I know of at least one instance where someone wanted to be full-time. When they didn't get it, they left the community. But, really not my area. I don't like having to worry about other people's feelings. So, I leave it to those that are more capable than I am (pretty much everyone).

EF needs strong CEO for growth. This is centralisation, but evolution doesn‚Äôt work in an opposite direction. Centralisation may come to decetralisation with right management. Otherwise we will observe Brownian motion, which is entropy in its essence.
Alex is the best developer ever, but his skills and time are limited as it is for every person on earth. We can't do several things per second.*) 
 
 I think goals and scope of EF to be defined first, especially since it is temporary non-profit entity by design. Race for abstract "growth" is a way to nowhere. 

For EF, I think supported activities are:

* support of protocol research, development of reference client, alternative clients (if needed),  libraries, dev tooling etc
* creating materials to educate developers and users 
* promoting adoption of Ergo
* get Ergo on centralized exchanges, hardware wallets, bridges etc 

Not sure genius CEO is needed for that, proper management 101  would be enough
Most of marketing can be done by community  I guess, with EF providing info on its plans and achievements, and also handling some sensitive issues (listings are under NDAs all the time etc)

 Absolutely agree. But even a non-profit entity has goals and success or failure in achieving a goal is determined by numbers, i.e. metrics (you don't wanna an entity to stagnate, isn't it?). The thing is that growth should not be abstract. It should be represented in metrics.
You have listed several tasks for EF. How do you measure success or failure in achieving the results of the tasks you just published? After all, you can't just do something for the sake of doing it. Everything has to have a meaning and a result. Do you have such a person who directs the EF team to reach those specific goals (or do these specific tasks) to achieve this and that metrics, or is this just a kind of a Brownian motion? Who is directing the team's efforts?

For example:
- We plan to list on 3 CEXes to reach ERG price X in a bull and Y in a bear market in 2022. What can we do to achieve it?;
- We need new Z addresses per month to ensure the community grows; What can we do to achieve it?

When you have specific goals, the team's actions become more specific and the entity evolves from Brownian motion into people who focus their efforts on what's needed.

I agree that a CEO is just a formalization. It's just a job title. A man who can steer the team toward measurable goals is enough.


[12/12/2022 12:12 PM] yashablack#0000
And one more thing. We usually think that path from A to G (goal) can be hit linearly. In fact, to get to G you need to test a huge number of hypotheses. This is the only way to understand the world around us (especially when it comes to business No matter profits or non-profits). I can say with confidence that if a team doesn't test at least one hypothesis a month to grow their metrics, they stagnate because they're not learning anything.

 I agree. I think where that's really a problem is "adoption of Ergo". That's also where I struggle with marketing/promotion activities as a Sigmanaut.

Sometimes I have the feeling the focus is on climbing rankings (mcap, users, social media impressions), but on the other hand people are talking about the Ergo manifesto und creating "real" utility.

I don't see a clear goal with respect to adoption, because the term adoption is way too abstract. When I read the manifesto, I get the feeling 5 people using Ergo for their every day transactions to friends or one succesful loan on Exle is more important than 1000 guys holding Erg just to speculate. I know that some basic level of economic activity is required to support the price, miners and exchanges and hence, that's important as well. I just don't know whether people are doing the right thing regarding promotion.That's where I am puzzled. Imo at least from the Sigmanauts perspective we are lacking goals and metrics in this area and hence, are doing stuff very untargeted. We are just hoping that doing more stuff solves our problems. Maybe it will work, but it is not efficient.

 I think the sigs are pretty focused and targeted at the moment TBH, we really just started fresh again...

With the sigs, we can't really front load this stuff without a framework or it will be a waste.

We decided to build three subcomittes to start:
1. Governance
2. Treasury
3. Social

- We JUST got a mission statement ready to vote on.
- Social is essentially "getting our feet wet with twitter" and finding people who are interested to train so they are ready
- Fast tracked community showcasing with the Sigma Update
- Treasury is the next big focus after this mission statement
- We are breaking out with Ambassador sub group and onboarding subgroup

Once those are in place we can attempt to raise funds for the treasury either from external sources, ongoing activities, a proposal to the EF, or other ideas.

With that strength and hopefully an increase of numbers, we can sucessfully engage the community to establish a framework moving forward...

That being said...it's a lot to do for the 5-7 sigs that frequently show up to the meetings and add to the agenda...need a few more üòâ

 I think in some sense we agree and in some sense not.

I was specifically talking about adoption, promotion and marketing and I know that some people do a lot, but I also know that atm we don't really measure and monitor the results. I know we are getting there.

Imo the natural way of doing things is 
1) (vague) mission statement 
2) identify more specific goals derived from the statement
3) build workgroups and identify subgoals and metrics measuring success/performance
4) start to put in effort

Atm we are doing all three at the same time and some people putting in effort in 4) aren't involved in 1) to 3). 

I am just talking about efficiency and effectiveness.

Personally, I am not a big fan of live meetings with many people. I prefer to think about things and write my thoughts down. And also focus on some topics. But that's just my preference.

 Gotcha, I don't think that all numbers need to be involved in other numbers above tho, and can be done concurrently. Can you help me understand a process where your preferred method of gathering can scale in this kind of environment, especially where we are this early and trying to get some baselines done?

In my experience static text and forms fall to the wayside against face to face or real time interactions...If you have a method of stopping that from happenning i am very interested in hearing it so that we can continue to involve as many people as possible. 

And i don't think asking other people to ingest it and present it on a large scale would be feasable, even though i'm asking people to do that to the agenda at this current moment in time as a stop gap.

 The reality is quite simple. 

The Ergo Foundation does not have the funding to pay for entry. A fair launch prevents ponzinomics. 

 A CEO will not change that. 

Ftx could have listed ERG.

At a list cost of 2 million USD and a daily expectation of 25 million volume. (Could be achieved with a market maker at a cost) 

Waves was offered 1.7 million. Also larger and has better preexisting market access. 

We could get on the front of basically any media... if we paid enough.

(re @Gstoiti : *I agree. I think where that's really a problem is "adoption of Ergo". That's also where I struggle with marketing/promotion activities as a Sigmanaut.

Sometimes I have the feeling the focus is on climbing rankings (mcap, users, social media impressions), but on the other hand people are talking about the Ergo manifesto und creating "real" utility.

I don't see a clear goal with respect to adoption, because the term adoption is way too abstract. When I read the manifesto, I get the feeling 5 peo...*) 
 
 Maybe that is just a result of different goals different groups within the community have in mind? And I think it is normal to have different goals btw, even more, no big community can exist  without such diversity

(re @kushti_ru : *With or without paid listings? üòÅ*) 
 
 lol


[12/12/2022 4:47 PM] kushti#0000
Historically, most of funds were spent on listings / MM requirements


[12/12/2022 4:47 PM] koutelier#0000
if they are plans for listing already add that amount on expense if not no lol


[12/12/2022 4:48 PM] koutelier#0000
if EF runs out of money for example in 5 years with current price , or if price drop 50% in 2.5 years and bull market takes longer we need to think of solution of keeping ergo alive


[12/12/2022 4:48 PM] kushti#0000
With no listings, 2 years at least


[12/12/2022 4:48 PM] koutelier#0000
this is too low


[12/12/2022 4:49 PM] kushti#0000
Historically, we were able to reduce ef spendings without slowing down dev


[12/12/2022 4:50 PM] kushti#0000
Which often meant me spending personal money though


[12/12/2022 4:50 PM] koutelier#0000
that's also not good


[12/12/2022 4:51 PM] koutelier#0000
EF can go bankrupt if bear market continues for more than 2 years. and personally i believe we will see even lower prices and even shittier market in all areas not just crypto


[12/12/2022 4:51 PM] koutelier#0000
For the sake of ergo EF needs to think of strategies for all scenarios if they haven't already


[12/12/2022 4:52 PM] kushti#0000
We are discussing different options since 2021 üòÅ


[12/12/2022 4:54 PM] Armeanio#0000
Discussed moving away from the EF eventually towards a private for profit oriented development. 

The rough idea is to potentially take a portion of that to create funding and keep core/community development incentivized.


[12/12/2022 4:54 PM] koutelier#0000
i will try to write down few ideas about funding that will might help EF , miner and the community at the end point. The dao i proposed could help bring some transparency and control over ergo from the community in a safe way but they are others solutions i believe. We can all find pros and cons and start raising money to keep ergo alive and maybe increase the marketing area


[12/12/2022 4:57 PM] koutelier#0000
@Armeanio i didn't understand how we take miners money if we make a dao that people vote with ergs


[12/12/2022 4:58 PM] Armeanio#0000
(re @koutelier : *@Armeanio i didn't understand how we take miners money if we make a dao that people vote with ergs*) 
 
 Oh I thought you were discussing redistributing storage rent


[12/12/2022 4:58 PM] koutelier#0000
no


[12/12/2022 4:58 PM] Armeanio#0000
heh then forget everything


[12/12/2022 4:58 PM] koutelier#0000
erg holders can vote with ergo tokens that a % will go back to miners with storage rent mechanism and % to EF .


[12/12/2022 4:59 PM] koutelier#0000
but EF goes that way needs to be fullly transparent on how those money are being handling


[12/12/2022 4:59 PM] Armeanio#0000

i am not talking about nda situations off course


[12/12/2022 5:00 PM] koutelier#0000
but salaries , expenses and everything need to be transparent. if community pays for everything they need to know where their money go


[12/12/2022 5:00 PM] koutelier#0000
off course they won't have fully access or won't be able to propose crazy things . only EF members will have that ability. Members can change by internal voting or with dao voting from the community


[12/12/2022 5:02 PM] koutelier#0000
we could even do raffles that will fund certain marketing things .for example community wants to hire a famous influencer we create a raffle and if they fund it we procced


[12/12/2022 5:03 PM] koutelier#0000
they are numerous ways of making money but we need to be transparent . they already know that EF has limit amount of money and this is why it takes so long for marketing. we have hundreds of thousand of addresses one erg of each address can achieve huge things


[12/12/2022 5:03 PM] kushti#0000

And such "market conditions" are quite insightful after all


[12/12/2022 5:13 PM] koutelier#0000
agree. When there are crisis also a lot of great opportunities can be created. Ergo has the fundamentals, has strong community so i believe if we give them a bit more power over the ecosystem we make ergo more decentralized and we will solve EF funding problem and hopefully we will increase the years EF can continue supporting devs or fast forward marketing


[12/12/2022 5:13 PM] koutelier#0000
ground rules has to be set before a huge move though if EF decides that such a movement is reasonable or much their policy


[12/12/2022 5:17 PM] koutelier#0000
for example EF should never create dao to support certain projects with money or spent marketing money that already have investors . that may seems strange but investors can grab this opportunity and manipulate the dao in their own benefit.  just a though

For those wondering how the EF marketing tasks are assigned and managed. this is a snippet of the main pipeline. there are 7 pipelines in total - Editorial, Events, Graphics, PR, Social Media, Video and Contributors.

Tasks are assigned, cards are moved along timeline depending on progress. All details are included in the cards themselves i.e links. uploading assets like docs, images anything relevant. Due dates assigned etc etc

(re @crandano : *hey man, I'll be around to kick it off if nobody else does and can join the conversation for about the first 30minutes

only question I'm not sure about is similar to this:

https://www.vxtwitter.com/theaggergakker/status/1601225202964516865

"What if it's a box with 0.001ERG and a lot of NFTs/Assets in it? What happens to the NFTs?*) 
 
 Miner can grab assets in this case. There was a proposal to disallow this in some soft-fork coming by scalahub but not sure it has enough support

@chepurnoy So to my understanding they can only charge 0.001 ERG og what's in the box yes?

What if it's a box with 0.001ERG and a lot of NFTs/Assets in. What happens to the NFTs ?

[12/13/2022 8:44 AM] CW#0000
Thanks for clarifying


[12/13/2022 8:45 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
so far there was no one speaking up against it, there were only approvals expressed


[12/13/2022 8:52 AM] crandano#0000
interesting, so the answer right now would be pointing towards the EIP and letting it be known that the conversation is currently ongoing?

if the soft fork happens the difference would be that the tokens are burned - I'm not understanding the difference if the options are: 
a) miner gets the tokens
b) the tokens are burned

other than this could be a nice miner incentive. the EIP mentions security ramifications that I may not be grasping though

how is the miner who gets to spend the box selected?


[12/13/2022 9:00 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
there is no real conversation ongoing, everyone expressed support for the suggestion

 can start discussing during eip chat this wed/fri (pending which way voting goes on when to hold it)


[12/13/2022 9:21 AM] crandano#0000
i'm still not understanding why the miners wouldn't get the tokens for incentivization? i think i'm missing something on this point and the EIP mentions it's security related

also how is the miner selected who gets to spend the box?


[12/13/2022 9:37 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
tokens like NFTs can't be distributed in a pool, value is very different so mining a token is something like a lottery, tokens might give rights to real world objects like real estate etc. a lot of difficulties and problems.


[12/13/2022 9:42 AM] HQ3rr#0000

 Miner is not selected, actually, anyone can collect storage rent. But we may assume that miners are not lazy (careless about their profits) and so will collect it ahead of others as they can do that. However, in reality miners are very lazy atm )

Miners can effectively switch storage rent off


[12/13/2022 11:05 AM] kushti#0000
By setting per-byte price to zero

 for contracts, often box preservation is checked, and for ERG value I saw this

SELF.value == selfOut.value


[12/13/2022 11:08 AM] kushti#0000
but in the presence of storage rent should be >=

Yeah I understand that now, switching to that


[12/13/2022 11:09 AM] kushti#0000
and contract should not prevent topping up in other ways (e.g. limiting number of inputs, rarely there's a reason for that)

 thanks, is how the miner would go about claiming posted somewhere?

so overall it kind of sounds like we're in limbo on Storage Rent in the sense that the conversation is ongoing on how to exactly handle it especially in light of a token potentially being property rights (ie it could represent a house in the future)

it would be problematic to allow a miner to claim that - also problematic to burn that

any other solutions that came up?

 nemo was not the only one implementing it, the first contract suggestion was made by nitram, several developers made suggestions and changes until eip was accepted. afaik nemo has not build anything to provide liquidity yet, in short: using the time effort he spent for integrating the feature into nautilus is not the time needed to develop it

 Will research more on for detailed article , will drop what bable fees are for now


[12/13/2022 12:04 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
what you should highlight and market is that babel fees on ergo are nothing more or less as just another smart contract. that's why it was so simple to add it.


[12/13/2022 12:07 PM] HQ3rr#0000
Just confirm this for me  " you can pay tx fees with bable fees, for things  like  ,trades, swapping tokens, minting nfts, staking fees " we can do all that today right?

[12/13/2022 12:28 PM] glasgowm#0000
The have no backwards control over the protocol, the only thing they‚Äôd get is the output which is burned in the alternative scenario. EF I would agree shouldn‚Äôt be included, a DAO of all ergo holders though? Or doing anything but burning it - stash it away somewhere until we can figure out what to do with it, would be a better idea imo.

 The weaknesses of DAO will affect the protocol. Also, not clear how it would be better than miners taking assets


[12/13/2022 12:55 PM] glasgowm#0000
The DAO could evaluate the asset and liquidate it and pass it on to miners if appropriate, or if it was something like a bank quorum key or oracle NFT they‚Äôd probably opt to return it. Better as a DAO of every ergo stakeholder could decide that rather than nanopool. Maybe could even distribute DAO tokens to addresses proportional to their mining rewards over time if you wanted a miner DAO

[12/13/2022 7:52 PM] cafebedouin#9837
On the topic of non-fungible assets, not being able to pay rent and multiple interested parties, the normal tradfi solution is  to auction the asset. Easy to imagine an auto-auction solution. It goes to a smart contract, bids are made in Erg, proceeds are sent to miners, valuable  NFTs are kept in circulation, people with valuable assets are incentized to maintain them or lose them. It is also possible for people that are worried about this issue can form a DAO to pay rent for assets of others based on some criteria, until the issue has a full solution.


[12/13/2022 7:58 PM] CW#0000
Dids was mentioned earlier which is interesting. Say someone comes into ergo, sets up id and interacts for what ever amount of time then becomes inactive or deceased estate etc. 

In this case it's wise to burn so access to the id isn't granted to a miner or someone purchasing it.


[12/13/2022 8:06 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Then, I suppose that suggests having some criteria for defining that kind of box. Normal path is auction. Special cases get burned that were predefined at box creation time.


[12/13/2022 8:06 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Since DIDs aren't implemented in ERGO, afaik, that could be part of that EIP.


[12/13/2022 8:12 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Also, DIDs could have limited life and scope by definition. Presumably, you would not want to keep valuable assets in a DID box, and they should have limits, maybe funded to an average lifespan level by default. The DID can be canceled on death as some kind of defined sequence, turned into oracle event that feeds into a smart contract with assets. Remaining ERG in the DID go to miners.


[12/13/2022 8:14 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Probably need an update feature where: dead or still living are options, that allow for burning the box and/or adding more ERG to it if one lives beyond the average.

@seedubya what could be a good topic for next community chat?


[12/14/2022 10:59 PM] kushti#0000
Fpga and asic resistance, upow?


[12/14/2022 11:13 PM] CW#0000
(re @kushti_ru : *@seedubya what could be a good topic for next community chat?*) 
 
 Sure! Very interesting topics there


[12/14/2022 11:17 PM] CW#0000
I have a list of topics compiled to pluck from week to week. 

I've seen some chatter recently from the mining community about widespread fpga use and potential asics. Been good to discuss how resistance to these is achieved


[12/14/2022 11:23 PM] CW#0000
UPoW is also on the lips of miners and non miners alike. Lots of questions to answer there outside of what it is etc. Such as UPoW 
- incentives to point hw there 
- main chain or side chain concensus/computation 
- decentralised marketplaces for people/entities seeking computation 

Just to name a few


[12/14/2022 11:23 PM] Tefcek21#0000
Could we also include some topics about specific projects each week? Maybe weekly we feature one project and give them 5 minutes to explain ?

 We could host a specific community/ecosystem/project chat each week. 

We are doing something similar now on Sigma Updates videos, highlighting different people, projects, social events etc but can also have a dedicated weekly text based chat

(re @kushti_ru : *Where does GreekErgo live?*) 
 
 There is no Greek ergo I believe. Although I have notice in miners groups  that people talk about ergo from Time to time . This twitter space is being schedule by Theodore who he is a well know Greek cardano community member , he is currently working with Dan friedman . This space was a Greek cardano space mainly but they talk in general about other coins and crypto news.

@ergomergoadargo if you speak to Theodore can you ask him if the space will have some questions to introduce ergo to cardano community ? Maybe with the proper questions we can keep the conversation in the right path


[12/15/2022 7:40 PM] koutelier#0000

Raffle are fun, 
Seeing how industry is , we should try to build  loan systems for dapps where if they don't fullfill, the lender can have  % stake In there dapp... It will make more sense for people to see as bussiness and invest more .. my 2 cents

 we gave a shotout to ergcube, sigmaverse, azorus and comet. We talked about ergo in general though so we didn't have the opportunity to talk more about projects maybe next time

 i totally feel you bro, whenever i eat late at night i have the same thing lol


[12/21/2022 7:12 PM] koutelier#0000
So ergonauts i have a proposal to make that we think will make ergo community stronger and it will bring more people to ecosystem. Ivan(spectrum team) proposed a very interesting marketing idea.

-Ergo needs activities to recruit mass audience
-In order to create space for informal communication brand Mascot is needed
Comet is a great option to be Ergo's Mascot 
-In order to start this path we are going to start a campaign, like Cometizzing Ergo, the main purpose of which will be growing knowledge that Comet is Ergo's Mascot.
-During the campaign we'll do:

-Weekly medium articles talking about what $COMET does in the ecosystem(always in $COMET funny/sarcastic way)
-Social giveaways for users that use $COMET tools or projects tools example: (Making comments on $COMET's paideia dao @marty_ergopad )
-Twitter spaces and youtube funny AMA's example: ( calling @kushti_ru and asking funny questions that community wants to know such as: wen new pants? how honored you feel $COMET is on ergo?)  

-But we need help from EF and projects at the period of the campaign:

-Spectrum Finance: UI integration @yashablack  @oskin 
-CW inviting $COMET or adding more $COMET "products to videos" such us adding $COMET to the nfts area he has behind him @seedubya 
-neta , adding $COMET on the staking pool @Frostyausty 
and many more we can discuss 


I would like to hear your feedback on this or your ideas

Also FYI i am not taking any founder token from $COMET so i don't have a personal benefit from making $COMET mascot of the ergo rather than the benefit i will have for promoting ergo itself

(re @NoahErgo : *I dont think EF should get involved with comet ü§£ü§£ü§£ but for all others is fun idea*) 
 
 EF might need $COMET at some point though. $COMET is fun but also has the ability to be the bad boy if needed. Things EF can't speak $COMET can and won't be criticized .lol


[12/21/2022 7:20 PM] NoahErgo#0000
well that is my point any kind of endorsement from EF is impossible, gets too complicated legally speaking and also they need to remain impartial

(re @NoahErgo : *well that is my point any kind of endorsement from EF is impossible, gets too complicated legally speaking and also they need to remain impartial*) 
 
 we don't ask for funds or smth like that

For ergo community as a whole, great but EF cannot do what you are asking


[12/21/2022 7:22 PM] NoahErgo#0000
they have said so


[12/21/2022 7:29 PM] koutelier#0000
yeah understood. You want to keep EF impartial , since we don't ask for funds or investors i don't see that as a problem tbh. Since $COMET will keep being honest and saying it doesn't do anything and people shouldn't not buy it


[12/21/2022 7:32 PM] koutelier#0000
to make it even safer for you guys i was gonna propose to make a multisig wallet together with EF to keep all $COMET tokens that are not distributed or won't be locked for the founders so there are no bad actors or doubts of rugs in any way.


[12/21/2022 7:33 PM] koutelier#0000
but if this is not appropriate for EF it is understandable and we respect that off course.


[12/21/2022 7:34 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Btw i cant speak for ef cause im not part of it but i have heard some of them say this before so thats why i say it. But i think could be fun thing for community to get involved with

Comet is in almost all ergo areas lol it‚Äôs good though to have this discussing we as comet already promote as much as we can ergo project and we will keep doing it anyways . The campaign will be launched with or without ergo ‚Äúsupport‚Äù lol

 Nooo I mean the mascot itself just represents them


[12/21/2022 9:04 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
i.e. the average "Lambo or food stamps" sort of character


[12/21/2022 9:16 PM] koutelier#0000
Even lambo , noodles people are necessary lol . Just take a look on most active tg chats on ergo. Are the chats that there is fun to be around.


[12/21/2022 9:17 PM] koutelier#0000
Ergo is making is making great job on engaging people on the ecosystem but we need to figure out ways to make people outside the ecosystem starting engaging with the blockchain

 I'm doing a spaces with a Cardano dude soon to talk about Ergo, I'll bring up Comet as much as I can 
Spectrum Labs will make it all much easier though


[12/21/2022 9:19 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
Totally agree with that!
I just find the idea of embodying fun too hard kinda risky for a blockchain whose image is mainly associated with big brains and techy advancements


[12/21/2022 9:20 PM] crandano#0000
(re @FoeniculumNFTs : *Nooo I mean the mascot itself just represents them*) 
 
 Similar to my opinion.

Ergo doesn‚Äôt need a meme coin as the mascot. I‚Äôm already tired of DEXs being food and animal themed. Ergo, to me, is a more serious vibe. Wants to help people and bring tools to the average person. Comet doesn‚Äôt represent that to me. 

I do appreciate the stuff Comet is doing though so don‚Äôt get me wrong there. Just making everything Comet - for me personally - not a great look.


[12/21/2022 9:22 PM] koutelier#0000
Hmm maybe mascot isn‚Äôt the right word . Not saying ergo should rebrand to comet for sure don‚Äôt get me wrong on this lol


[12/21/2022 9:23 PM] crandano#0000
If I was looking into another cryptocurrency for the first time and the Space or the AMA/update videos were meme coin themed I‚Äôd nope out pretty quickly and not take it serious.

(re @FoeniculumNFTs : *Totally agree with that!

 Well average user doesn‚Äôt understand shit about the tech tbh so no need to focus on one area if you want to achieve mass adoption

(re @crandano : *If I was looking into another cryptocurrency for the first time and the Space or the AMA/update videos were meme coin themed I‚Äôd nope out pretty quickly and not take it serious.*) 
 
 I don‚Äôt mean ergo should promote comet . Comet will promote ergo . But support will be needed


[12/21/2022 9:24 PM] koutelier#0000
Small things like adding comet behind the cw for example like he has nfts atm


[12/21/2022 9:24 PM] koutelier#0000
Not big changes

Or coming over funny  AMAs


[12/21/2022 9:25 PM] koutelier#0000
I am not asking for EF to promote comet . This will work the other way around

(re @koutelier : *Well average user doesn‚Äôt understand shit about the tech tbh so no need to focus on one area if you want to achieve mass adoption*) 
 
 They don't understand the technicalities but they can perceive them, and that's what can make Ergo stand out in their eyes; if we slap a dog coin everywhere, we'll lose that sort of brand image


[12/21/2022 9:33 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
I do agree that COMET does have a big reason to exist and it can be extremely useful at attracting that fun-seeking audience!


[12/21/2022 9:33 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
I'm just warning that the EF adopting the mascot might skew Ergo brand image into the wrong direction


[12/21/2022 9:34 PM] crandano#0000
I like your ideas on weekly medium articles, giveaways, comments on Comet‚Äôs Paideia DAO, and things like that.

I‚Äôm biased because I‚Äôve been in crypto for the potential benefits to humanity. I‚Äôm not big on the memes and turning everything into a joke. So I‚Äôm biased. The Ergonaut is Ergo‚Äôs mascot to me.

Not trying to rain on your fun though and definitely create spaces and promote anything you want and enjoy life. 

It is good to have a fun account that can call out bs that faces in the community or EF cannot.


[12/21/2022 9:41 PM] koutelier#0000
first of all we just spitting ideas to help with marketing in any way we can not all ideas are good lol. i hear your concerns and they are reasonable, making everything cometish on ergo wasn't the end goal and off course  we will keep doing those things since we had already plans for those things . we just though that maybe this campaign could bring even more people to ecosystem.


[12/21/2022 9:42 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
I think it'd be helpful to brainstorm ideas that have been battle tested on other chains and have proven to be successful imo


[12/21/2022 9:43 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
Twitter Spaces are keeping the Cardano space alive, and they're versatile enough to range from very technical ones, to shilly ones, to chill ones


[12/21/2022 9:43 PM] koutelier#0000
vitalik was wearing shibainu pants. maybe we should gift comet pants to kushti lol


[12/21/2022 9:43 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
That's something that COMET can easily gain a foothold on, chill Ergo twitter spaces


[12/21/2022 9:44 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @FoeniculumNFTs : *That's something that COMET can easily gain a foothold on, chill Ergo twitter spaces*) 
 
 we plan on doing twitter spaces. Also i was thikning of youtube fun interviews


[12/21/2022 9:45 PM] koutelier#0000
like the one Zach Galifianakis was doing if you know him


[12/21/2022 9:46 PM] koutelier#0000
people tend to invest on persons not chains with all those scandals and stuff


[12/21/2022 9:46 PM] koutelier#0000
if you know what i mean


[12/21/2022 9:46 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
That's amazing man! If I can suggest, make sure you have some basic structure for the space to avoid awkward silence or pure chaos - set a purpose for the space and stick to it, so people know what to expect next time they tune in

 the perks of being meme is we can trow a space that chill music will play for 2 hours if we don't have something to say. need to keep it stupid and fun lol

We need some solid marketing plan to push Rosen when it comes out

1) Twitter spaces to:
a) handhold Cardano peeps on how to use it, 
b) reassure people of its security by explaining what makes it more secure than e.g. Nomad bridge
c) generic Q&A to establish a relationship with the Cardano Community and gain their trust

2) Infographics on:
a) Ergo basics such as which wallets to use and DeFi info, 
b) Comparison with other bridges to highlight its security features
c) Recap all the dApps Cardano peeps can play with once they bridge their tokens; highlighting those that DO NOT exist on Cardano such as Ergopad, ergflip.com, Comet Lottery etc

@glasgowm  @Armeanio do you have stats on how many people followed after the new account (taking into consideration a bunch of eth prob left it too, so it would only count new followers not people who left)....would be interesting to see how many people came over (sorry, would ask CW but hes on da boat).

(re @FoeniculumNFTs : *it'd be shilling if we were talking about a token, we'll be educating and reassuring people about a unique tool they've never seen before*) 
 
 We have to ask @mhs_sam  also about if he's ok with that :)

(re @FoeniculumNFTs : *In the same respect, Spectrum joining spaces with their official account rather than with @Gazza_SP 's would make it easier for newbies to check out what Spectrum is all about, follow it etc*) 
 
 Good point, I'll start doing this going forward it may look a bit better to observers


[12/22/2022 3:42 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Just thought I'd point out that there is a subset of people that don't like how the @Ergo_Platform was put into play. I, for example, will never follow or retweet from it. It's a dead issue, and I don't want to beat a dead horse about it. But, I also am not going to support that decision moving forward.

 lemme see if i can look up some stats, be back in a bit


[12/22/2022 3:43 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
From my recent spree of cardano Twitter spaces I think a lot do know of ergo at least, the comments and questions related to ergo are always very positive

 That's a sub-group that will be "replaced" by all the newbies joining once Rosen is up imo, and said sub-group can still be reached by joining and sharing the space from the 65k one


[12/22/2022 3:44 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
It may be the issue that the majority are just inactive currently so they aren't listening to these spaces, a good average listerer count would still be less than 200


[12/22/2022 3:44 PM] HQ3rr#0000
And please , clarification on "ergo is cardano testnet " is must


[12/22/2022 3:44 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Well, you might view people as fungible. I don't share that view.


[12/22/2022 3:45 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
(re @Gazza_SP : *From my recent spree of cardano Twitter spaces I think a lot do know of ergo at least, the comments and questions related to ergo are always very positive*) 
 
 Yessir, and the main problem is that most of them are either:
a) lazy, won't touch ERG until it can be swapped for ADA
b) don't know about all the dapps, NFTs etc


[12/22/2022 3:46 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
(re  : *<cafebedouin> Well, you might view people as fungible. I don't share that view.*) 
 
 It's an objective statement, I didn't mean to be disrespectful:

If X people stopped following the new one, that drop in followers will be filled up by brand new people (the "post-Rosen era") who won't even know or care as much about the ETC drama


[12/22/2022 3:48 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Descriptive. There is a replacement cycle. I'm not the market for Twitter Spaces in any event, but I did think it was worth mentioning


[12/22/2022 3:49 PM] koutelier#0000
By making distinctions on those accounts we will keep the drama going . It‚Äôs happened and now it‚Äôs over . We all go on with our lives and mission


[12/22/2022 3:50 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
(re  : *<cafebedouin> Descriptive. There is a replacement cycle. I'm not the market for Twitter Spaces in any event, but I did think it was worth mentioning*) 
 
 Exactly; it's sad what happened within thd community following the ETC drama, but we need to focus on the future of Ergo and building a new follower base on the main account is critical to keep everyone updated on what's going on in the ecosystem


[12/22/2022 3:51 PM] cafebedouin#9837
No one gets a clean slate. The move was a declaration of character. Going along with it is also a declaration of character, one I'm not going to make. You all are free to do as you wish.

 Bad or good decision it happened . Some agree some not . The thing is you can‚Äôt change the past so let‚Äôs change the future . The character of ergo is not formatted by accepting something from a friend and trying to communicate with etc for finding a solution to this . Anyway everyone has different opinion and all are respected .

Sigmanauts Meeting Agenda 1/8/22
Sigmanauts Meeting Agenda 1/8/23 3pm UTC  Sigmanauts!  Recap on action items from last year  Sigmanauts twitter hosting community spaces events  From FOE:We need some solid marketing plan to push Rosen when it comes out 	This would engage with the MAIN EF account, so CW, Angie, would be great if...

[12/22/2022 3:58 PM] koutelier#0000
It would be nice to see ergo platform and not sigmanauts on this space since from the first look people know what to research or what is all about imo . Like foe said we need to show spectrum not gazza . Research who is who is an extra step that most users wont even do


[12/22/2022 3:59 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000

 Yep we need to hand-feed them as much basic info as possible at first, then it's up to them to do more research if they like what they see!


[12/22/2022 3:59 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
But we do need the Sigmanaut one too to extend the reach and slowly make people familiarize with the Sigmanaut program too


[12/22/2022 3:59 PM] HQ3rr#0000
(re @FoeniculumNFTs : *Yep we need to hand-feed them as much basic info as possible at first, then it's up to them to do more research if they like what they see!*) 
 
 Not EF task, more of sigmanauts thing


[12/22/2022 4:00 PM] HQ3rr#0000
But yeah, main can provide the traffic and show of affection


[12/22/2022 4:00 PM] HQ3rr#0000
Towards the community and projects


[12/22/2022 4:00 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
(re @HQ3rr : *Not EF task, more of sigmanauts thing*) 
 
 That's literally everyone's task; if the main Ergo account is the MAIN one - i.e. the place that welcomes newbs who are typing "Ergo" in the twitter search bar - then that account too must welcome them with the basics


[12/22/2022 4:01 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @HQ3rr : *Not EF task, more of sigmanauts thing*) 
 
 Introducing Rosen to twitter and cardano folks is a task EF should do IMO


[12/22/2022 4:02 PM] HQ3rr#0000
(re @FoeniculumNFTs : *That's literally everyone's task; if the main Ergo account is the MAIN one - i.e. the place that welcomes newbs who are typing "Ergo" in the twitter search bar - then that account too must welcome them with the basics*) 
 
 I think we have been in discussion for months now ...where EF wants to take core dev and research path... But yeah, Rosen is different, mhs is EF member too..


[12/22/2022 4:02 PM] dadreboi#0000
(re @FoeniculumNFTs : *That's literally everyone's task; if the main Ergo account is the MAIN one - i.e. the place that welcomes newbs who are typing "Ergo" in the twitter search bar - then that account too must welcome them with the basics*) 
 
 sigmanauts are supposed to be the community...ergo, everyone....admittedly, the EF has a much broader reach for now and it's good to talk about this....


[12/22/2022 4:04 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
(re @dadreboi : *sigmanauts are supposed to be the community...ergo, everyone....admittedly, the EF has a much broader reach for now and it's good to talk about this....*) 
 
 It's common sense:
as a newbie to the Ergo ecosystem, the first thing I look for is the crypto's main account.

If I find basic info there to familiarize with the ecosystem then my "learning journey" becomes much smoother rather than hopping between accounts (that, by the way, I would have no clue they exist in the first place, such as the Sigmanaut one)


[12/22/2022 4:04 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @dadreboi : *sigmanauts are supposed to be the community...ergo, everyone....admittedly, the EF has a much broader reach for now and it's good to talk about this....*) 
 
 The sigmanauts channel can promote projects and ergo pretty well but Rosen is ergo product and since it will be a public introduction in twitter for first time from main channel EF members and core devs if possible should be there and talk imo


[12/22/2022 4:04 PM] dadreboi#0000
sorry, i don't mean to be conflating this


[12/22/2022 4:04 PM] dadreboi#0000
yes, agree rosen is a core dev thus EF is going to promote the heck out of it id imagine


[12/22/2022 4:05 PM] dadreboi#0000
i was going further into the future with other things


[12/22/2022 4:05 PM] koutelier#0000
So we can all promote it as an official introduction and the right people speak about it.


[12/22/2022 4:05 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
Yep we don't want it to flop like the ERG / FLUX pair on Spectrum


[12/22/2022 4:05 PM] koutelier#0000
You want armeanio or Sam (or official members )to talk about it to cardano whale for example not a community member imho


[12/22/2022 4:06 PM] koutelier#0000
The community can talk about it in other spaces off course to promote it


[12/22/2022 4:06 PM] HQ3rr#0000
Start Creating  hype. And don't drop the bomb next day..drag it a bit ,if you see some nice turn in overall crypto condition, drop it


[12/22/2022 4:06 PM] dadreboi#0000
but rosen brings other things that shouldn't take up the EF spaces per say.


[12/22/2022 4:06 PM] dadreboi#0000
and as you say @koutelier can break out to side promote community effects of it


[12/22/2022 4:07 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @HQ3rr : *Start Creating  hype. And don't drop the bomb next day..drag it a bit ,if you see some nice turn in overall crypto condition, drop it*)

[12/22/2022 4:08 PM] Armeanio#0000
What am I needed for?


[12/22/2022 4:08 PM] HQ3rr#0000
And one more thing which I already suggested, Rosen isn't only ergo project, it's cardano too... Maybe getting a launch event ama on YouTube with charles


[12/22/2022 4:08 PM] HQ3rr#0000
(re @HQ3rr : *And one more thing which I already suggested, Rosen isn't only ergo project, it's cardano too... Maybe getting a launch event ama on YouTube with charles*) 
 
 Convince Charles to be at launch .


[12/22/2022 4:09 PM] dadreboi#0000
(re @Armeanio : *What am I needed for?*) 
 
 was looking for some twitter stats, found some online tho. mark answered already too.


[12/22/2022 4:09 PM] HQ3rr#0000
(re @Armeanio : *What am I needed for?*) 
 
 That's your task, convince Charles on do Rosen launch  on YouTube channel or spaces


[12/22/2022 4:09 PM] Armeanio#0000
Oh I don't have access to that account.


[12/22/2022 4:09 PM] dadreboi#0000
also, when CW gets back perhaps he can detail out the marketing approach for rosen launch


[12/22/2022 4:10 PM] dadreboi#0000
and then come to meeting on the 8th to hear community suggestions too (like Foe's above)


[12/22/2022 4:10 PM] Armeanio#0000
(re @HQ3rr : *That's your task, convince Charles on do Rosen launch  on YouTube channel or spaces*) 
 
 lol


[12/22/2022 4:10 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
(re @Armeanio : *What am I needed for?*) 
 
 Hosting a space on the main Ergo twitter account when Rosen drops to teach, hand hold and reassure Cardano peeps about it

That will also help the "new" Ergo twitter account to build a new follower base


[12/22/2022 4:11 PM] HQ3rr#0000
(re @Armeanio : *lol*) 
 
 Will make @Dan do it, he knows how to do emotional blackmailing üòÇ


[12/22/2022 4:11 PM] koutelier#0000
Sigmanauts/everyone can do something cool . Start tagging and asking respected Cardano people to be in that space


[12/22/2022 4:11 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
Cardano Whale liked and commented my tweet about the bridge news, someone like him sharing the space would drive a lot of traffic to the new twitter account


[12/22/2022 4:12 PM] dadreboi#0000
Foe, we don't know what's planned yet with CW's social group. I think it would be great to hear that first and go from there to know what Sigs can do and what you can suggest to enhance EF from your standpoint.


[12/22/2022 4:12 PM] dadreboi#0000
otherwsie i feel we are making assumptions

 True, we have to wait for CW; I'm just getting very excited and want the Rosen launch to be as successful as possible üéÖüî•


[12/22/2022 4:13 PM] dadreboi#0000
im just gunshy about pitchforks...sorry, don't mean to cool you off...by all means, shine bright bud


[12/22/2022 4:13 PM] Armeanio#0000
I think it is best to avoid trying to making things charles centric. He is busy. 

Some discussions and potential for 2023 but anyway best to proceed independently.


[12/22/2022 4:14 PM] HQ3rr#0000
(re @Armeanio : *I think it is best to avoid trying to making things charles centric. He is busy.

 We can have other cardano guys, rick is nice guy

(re @Armeanio : *I think it is best to avoid trying to making things charles centric. He is busy.

 For sure, that's why spaces would put the spotlight on the main Ergo twitter account


[12/22/2022 4:15 PM] Armeanio#0000
We have a weird line to walk there anyway. Most cardano peeps are somewhat anti pow.


[12/22/2022 4:15 PM] dadreboi#0000
(re @Armeanio : *We have a weird line to walk there anyway. Most cardano peeps are somewhat anti pow.*) 
 
 NFT cardano groups seem to not care and are interested, good avenue in


[12/22/2022 4:15 PM] Armeanio#0000
Ergo is more of an extension of bitcoin than similar to cardano. Other than smart contracts.


[12/22/2022 4:16 PM] dadreboi#0000
as foe or someone said, the handfull of cardano nft meetups have been 100% amazed by ergo nfts


[12/22/2022 4:16 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
(re @Armeanio : *We have a weird line to walk there anyway. Most cardano peeps are somewhat anti pow.*) 
 
 If we don't have any infographics on the pros of PoW we can prepare them too

Especially how it adds extra security to PoS


[12/22/2022 4:16 PM] Armeanio#0000
The testnet narrative is funny though.


[12/22/2022 4:16 PM] HQ3rr#0000
@dadreboi  do we have any sigmanaut  with scouting and delivering msgs abilities?  crandano  & @NoahErgo  can get some cardano folks interested for the Rosen and start spreading the word too


[12/22/2022 4:16 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
(re @dadreboi : *as foe or someone said, the handfull of cardano nft meetups have been 100% amazed by ergo nfts*) 
 
 And by dapps / defi such as Ergo building the protocol DJED is based on etc


[12/22/2022 4:16 PM] Armeanio#0000

 what are you speaking about here?


[12/22/2022 4:21 PM] Armeanio#0000

what do you like more, NFT's or Twitter Spaces?


[12/22/2022 4:22 PM] Armeanio#0000
We are uniquely positioned to potentially support both darkfi and defi.

 Well a bridge is made of 2 blockchains so in this case it's only logical to welcome the other chain by educating them

Plus, Rosen was built by a member of the EF, showing that Ergo can easily build masterpieces on its own


[12/22/2022 4:22 PM] HQ3rr#0000

 Well that's just bridge 1.

What I don't want to see "cardano build Rosen bridge"


[12/22/2022 4:23 PM] Armeanio#0000
Once Rosen is built out cardano is just a side piece.


[12/22/2022 4:24 PM] dadreboi#0000
Joe, any plans for the EF to push forward and persue other chains to cross to? or are you waiting for a more organic effort?


[12/22/2022 4:24 PM] Armeanio#0000
(re @dadreboi : *Joe, any plans for the EF to push forward and persue other chains to cross to? or are you waiting for a more organic effort?*) 
 
 Yes but it's not the EF. Rosen is its own team.


[12/22/2022 4:25 PM] dadreboi#0000
but rosen devs are funded by ef no? or just one of them?


[12/22/2022 4:25 PM] Armeanio#0000
Similar to how Ilya was our main explorer dev then pivoted into spectrum.


[12/22/2022 4:25 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
(re @Armeanio : *Once Rosen is built out cardano is just a side piece.*) 
 
 Unlike others, Cardanians are unfamiliar with bridges tho, hence the extra educational help they can benefit from


[12/22/2022 4:25 PM] Armeanio#0000
Still helps with the explorer.

 ok, so there are fundamental profit gaining initivates that are in the future to support the team building rosen?

Yes there will be a Rosen token. But specifics are a wip.

(re @dadreboi : *of course, just trying to gauge where the drive would come from in the future to hop to other chains*) 
 
 Projects expanding into new markets, and then arbitrage trading probably.


[12/22/2022 4:29 PM] Armeanio#0000
Cheaper than exchange costs and less barriers for decentralized projects.


[12/22/2022 4:29 PM] dadreboi#0000
(re @Armeanio : *Projects expanding into new markets, and then arbitrage trading probably.*) 
 
 do we have a out of the gate plan developed yet? meaning, anything on cardano that will use the bridge on day one besides for arbitrage?


[12/22/2022 4:29 PM] dadreboi#0000
any project that we can talk to to give us a day one you can do this kinda thing


[12/22/2022 4:30 PM] Armeanio#0000
I have discussed this a bit with some yes.


[12/22/2022 4:30 PM] dadreboi#0000
anything you can talk about in public?


[12/22/2022 4:30 PM] Armeanio#0000
Nope


[12/22/2022 4:30 PM] Armeanio#0000
Not without making drama potentially.


[12/22/2022 4:30 PM] dadreboi#0000

[12/22/2022 4:30 PM] dadreboi#0000
new token?


[12/22/2022 4:31 PM] Armeanio#0000
Once we are closer perhaps. For now IMO the best support is around just awareness.


[12/22/2022 4:32 PM] Armeanio#0000
I have recommended MHS put up the Kaching bot on twitter for public testnet.


[12/22/2022 4:32 PM] Armeanio#0000
Also when it is live.


[12/22/2022 4:32 PM] dadreboi#0000
did you get the source for kaching?


[12/22/2022 4:32 PM] Armeanio#0000

Binance CEO publicly called Tether a black box. 

This is coming from the world's largest crypto exchange. 

We now learn, 

Binance's former chief financial officer did not have access to the company's full accounts during his three-year tenure.

The story is getting good, no?

 On the media aspect of that concern...

Part of this is in the plan already for sigs...you can see us starting it here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V7nNTVHEJ-ndBwa19kPOraivGU2zaDKdF6O17QXz76g/edit
We've asked Rishabh to index every show or media event that mentiones ergo, and they are off to a great start. From there, I'll create a front end to a db that's searchable and allows sigs to add things to it for indexing. Even grabbing the transcript from youtube and indexing that. 

This will allow any community member to search for a keyword in a large database of media and get a timestamp from a video on where something is mentioned.

For now, I usually give people a link to a hash it out, ama, sigma update, right at the timestamp of importance. This gives my friend to choice to continue watching after they see the initial part of the clip 

As far as NEW short clips of important things that we can really make simple for non devs...i think we can manage this soon with fairly low bandwidth requirements, even if I have to do it myself, and will stick it up on the agenda for next years meeting.

Maybe we can merge these with the sigmanauts meetings and have a big one with everyone in it?*) 
 
 Sorry. I overslept.


[12/28/2022 2:23 PM] glasgowm#0000
No worries - just a quick one as most people are on holiday.

Discussed 
- ERGOHACK, need to finalise a topic to announce. 
- Increasing focus on regional outreach/meetups and guidance/structure for people to take that on.
- Few editorial pieces in the works (yield, EF transparency). 
- Merging ergonauts meeting with sigmanauts meeting as
  - It currently conflicts with dev-meeting
  - Nothing in these meetings that can‚Äôt be discussed with sigmanauts, and keeping them in the loop would be better. 
  - One busy meeting would be better IMO.

 I am for the merge, too many chats and calls for me already, a developer should develop in the first place


[12/31/2022 8:06 PM] crandano#0000
next meeting would be January 8 @ 15:00 UTC, 

then Sigmanauts hold meetings every Sunday at the same time. maybe we could have the first Sunday of the month (with january starting on the 8th, then it would be February 5th) be the most 'important' meeting to attend as a group? 

then of course everyone is welcome to the following Sunday meetings

thoughts?


[12/31/2022 8:07 PM] crandano#0000
or maybe there's a better day/time, so far that day/time has worked for Sigmanauts, but first meeting of the month could be different day/time as a group if that works better

 Are you doing this from Paideia/Ergopad Twitter or from the main Ergo Platform one? IMO we should leverage the latter, make the most of those followers


[01/04/2023 3:33 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
Plus many Ergo newbies might just be following that main account rather than every single dapp ones


[01/04/2023 3:33 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
Otherwise you'll end up hosting an echo chamber among your usual followers rather than maximising outreach and get new peeps into Paideia


[01/04/2023 3:37 PM] Alexis#0000
(re @FoeniculumNFTs : *Are you doing this from Paideia/Ergopad Twitter or from the main Ergo Platform one? IMO we should leverage the latter, make the most of those followers*) 
 
 To be honest, this one will be held on ErgoPad, as we will make important announcements and explain our upcoming plans.


[01/04/2023 3:38 PM] Alexis#0000
And I think we might onboard a lot of Cardano people, since it will cover Cardano and Catalayst topics.


[01/04/2023 3:40 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
(re @Alexis : *And I think we might onboard a lot of Cardano people, since it will cover Cardano and Catalayst topics.*) 
 
 Which is great, but where's your audience?
If they're following Ergopad, you've already onboarded them

You need to target those who have a superficial knowledge about Ergo because e.g. Charles shilled it, or because they heard about it when the merge happened, or when FLUX allowed for ERG/FLUX swaps, and the first thing those people do is to follow the main Ergo account


[01/04/2023 3:40 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
They might not even know Ergopad exists


[01/04/2023 3:40 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
That's why we need to leverage the main Ergo account for Spaces, it's crazy that it hasn't been done before

 Flux on spectrum is a parallel asset that you get from swapping flux in their wallet zelcore. It is a centralized bridging process

basically a wrapped token

Note: You have to turn on Developer mode in the settings in Ledger Live. Keep in mind this is still experimental mode so heed precautions.

Hi everyone. I remember seeing a comment that the EF just has 800k ERG left in the treasury. May I ask how long this treasury can support the EFs salaries/dev work for? 
I‚Äôm a tad bit concerned as the $ERG price is so low. At a $1 ERG (did not calculate exactly) we have nearly 1M USD. Big difference if $ERG was $20. How does the EF plan for longevity right now?

Okay so based on my calculations of total salaries monthly at $ERGS current price, the EF only has about 10 months left of funding. This does not include anything other than salaries. Is this accurate? This seems very concerning to me


[01/07/2023 9:00 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I know the eventual goal is a community takeover per se, just not sure that should happen within a 10 month timeframe.

Each space needs to have an objective: e.g. acquisition vs retention, who's our audience? e.g. PoW skepticals, Ergo newbies, DeFi hunters, old school cypherpunks etc

 It's neither - it's just reaching out to a broader audience via a medium that they use regularly and that's proven to be more effective than e.g. YouTube

As a whole, the ecosystem hosting regular spaces whether projects talking about their product, community members talking about ergo or simply having general interest categories can go a long way to attracting people here, enticing people into 'our' hosted spaces instead of join others

 Exactly, and that's why we should use the Ergo Platform account to reach out to the huge number of followers it has


[01/08/2023 4:40 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
just like loads of other projects do, like in the screenshots I showed you

This is but one account, yes there is a large following but like I mentioned above, having numerous entities finding their voices and driving this constant engagement will limo be more beneficial to the ecosystem as a whole

 We need to start somewhere tho, and the account everyone - newbies and veteran Ergonauts - follow is the main one

It helps projects like Paideia / Ergopad etc with reaching out to that audience that wouldn't have known about them otherwise


[01/08/2023 4:58 PM] CW#0000
There is a willingness on the cardano side for apps, nft projects, nft fans, community members, interest groups etc etc to all host spaces, we are starting to see a little of it on our side with people/projects joining these hosted by cardano peeps. 

It would be good to see it replicated here with numerous entities in our ecosystem hosting to spread the word of their product/passion


[01/08/2023 4:58 PM] Chris Ray#2713
Let's start with the Sigmanaut channel and have the Ergo_platform listening, I have noticed that I join spaces mostly based on who else is listening.

@Foeniculum we talked about this today and qx0 is willing to spearhead hosting (I think), I am willing to assist although I can't get too detailed on technicals I can however chit-chat, soo with that in mind and with the pointer that Sisyphushpush suggested I will start a doc as a guide for an upcoming space.


[01/08/2023 5:01 PM] CW#0000
Chris be great for example for regular exle spaces, updates on the co-op, social side happening in Kenya, updating on ui/ux testing. Talking about the vote recently proposed

 You're comparing us to an ecosystem that's way more evolved though, with many sub-cultures that have already developed

We don't have that on Ergo yet, so if each project hosted their own spaces it risks to end up an echo chamber due to the low reach

The main Ergo Platform account, followed by e.g. Cardano peeps, Flux / Alephium peeps, eutxo alliance ones etc, can be used to showcase Ergo projects that also host their own spaces


[01/08/2023 5:01 PM] CW#0000
Just one example

(re @seedubya : *Chris be great for example for regular exle spaces, updates on the co-op, social side happening in Kenya, updating on ui/ux testing. Talking about the vote recently proposed*) 
 
 But his audience will be people already familiar with EXLE, how do your reach those outside that?

By using the Ergo platform account

 Not sure why we are so afraid to use the one account we know is followed by the whole community, newbies and not


[01/08/2023 5:09 PM] Chris Ray#2713
I don't want to be so ummm... restricted on how I present myself, just using the Sigmanaut account kind of worry's me cause it is somewhat official, using the official platform account will be good when discussing Core development, I would like to talk about community projects.


[01/08/2023 5:09 PM] Chris Ray#2713
And showing support for community projects also is a goal of the Sigmanaut program, so it goes hand in hand


[01/08/2023 5:10 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
(re  : *<Chris Ray> And showing support for community projects also is a goal of the Sigmanaut program, so it goes hand in hand*) 
 
 You need to go where your audience is; if the majority is on the Ergo Platform main account, that's the one that will maximise our reach


[01/08/2023 5:11 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
Osmosis, Oasis Protocol, Fetch etc are all doing that with great results - thousands are joining


[01/08/2023 5:12 PM] Chris Ray#2713
Soon as Exle is in public test I will do some of that, I just have such a hard time saying soon anymore to be honest.


[01/08/2023 5:12 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
meanwhile we keep pushing e.g. live AMAs on YouTube where not even 100 people will join


[01/08/2023 5:15 PM] Chris Ray#2713
ok we can look at it for sure, I am not disagreeing with you, let's first start a Sigmanaut spaces and go from there, we need a solid plan to host from the main channel and maybe a little practice too.


[01/08/2023 5:15 PM] Chris Ray#2713
I see exactly what you are saying


[01/08/2023 5:19 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
(re  : *<Chris Ray> ok we can look at it for sure, I am not disagreeing with you, let's first start a Sigmanaut spaces and go from there, we need a solid plan to host from the main channel and maybe a little practice too.*) 
 
 Imo that will be confusing as people will have to bounce between Sigmanauts and Ergo Platform accounts for the same Twitter Space content

Instead, we can leverage both accounts to achieve different objectives

E.g. the main account can focus on customer acquisition: host cross-chain chats with Ergo projects and their eutxo alliance counterparts, showcase individual projects' major updates (e.g. beta releases, demos etc) as well as new projects

The Sigmanaut one can focus on retention, by building a closer relationship with the followers via e.g. laid back twitter spaces with community members, no shill just chill


[01/08/2023 5:25 PM] Chris Ray#2713
I am all for having a laid back no shill just chill spaces where others feel comfortable joining, it is the main account proposal you make I am less comfortable with, like a lot.

(re  : *<Chris Ray> I am all for having a laid back no shill just chill spaces where others feel comfortable joining, it is the main account proposal you make I am less comfortable with, like a lot.*) 
 
 What makes you uncomfortable about that?


[01/08/2023 5:27 PM] Chris Ray#2713
Have to mind your manners if you are speaking from the main channel, that is no fun.


[01/08/2023 5:27 PM] Chris Ray#2713
If it is not me hosting I can assist with it


[01/08/2023 5:28 PM] Chris Ray#2713
but someone has to speak from the channel, so we are going to need a volunteer, and that is if its ok to use it also.


[01/08/2023 5:28 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
(re  : *<Chris Ray> Have to mind your manners if you are speaking from the main channel, that is no fun.*) 
 
 I think it's less about what's fun or not, it's more about helping the ecosystem thrive by leveraging the marketing tools at our disposal

(re  : *<Chris Ray> but someone has to speak from the channel, so we are going to need a volunteer, and that is if its ok to use it also.*) 
 
 Sure, and that would be the next step - finding a reliable moderator


[01/08/2023 5:35 PM] Chris Ray#2713
Count me in, I will work on the Sigmanaut channel, no shill just chill open conversations, and I can help support the Ergo_Platform endeavor also, you get to find the mod tho, or be it maybe? üòâ

 Love to hear that man! I'll be happy to join you üòÅ

I can assist a moderator but I don't think I'd be a good one, plus there might be a conflict of interests since it'd look like the main Ergo account is doing favoritisms to a NFT project by letting them host a space on the official account


[01/08/2023 5:46 PM] Chris Ray#2713
I feel that too, I have a large interest in gaining traction for Exle and although I have been in the ecosystem for a long while I still want to avoid the favoritism look, its a hard spot to be in.

@FoeniculumNFTs can you ask speakers what their experience is like developing on cardano vs ergo


[01/08/2023 8:40 PM] NoahErgo#0000
challenges of each


[01/08/2023 8:41 PM] crandano#0000
it sucks twitter spaces requires the phone app, right? or is there a way to do it on pc (to talk)?

because it might be cool to do the Weekly Update & AMA where it's recorded as it normally is - but also plugged into a Twitter Space via the main account, then could make the decision to field questions from the audience (or not do that, could be a pain to manage - just take questions normally and field them on a Twitter post and YouTube)

 lame. yeah makes something like what i just said enough of a pain in the ass to not do. something to think about though even if it's once a month or quarterly update & ama

 You can jump in and ask yourself if you want? Seeing more speakers asking questions really helps with engagement imo ;)

 Sorry fell asleep when talking last night, it was 4am. I'm happy offering my time contributing and discussing things.

Hosting/moderating is a whole different energy required and one that I don't find particularly comfortable in that enviroment. I would have it a guess I'm not the only one also. Many express the desire to join/listen/contribute but are reluctant to host/moderate for what ever their reason. 

That being said I can give the stage for others to do so

Do you think it‚Äôs worth extracting the framework into a separate lib? Makes debugging contracts much faster.

No magic here. To test logic of contracts we created a DSL that mirrors ErgoScript syntax and built-in functions so that ErgoScript can be copy-pasted to IDE as-is.

 If we do something like that interview with Gazza you mentioned, lots of inside jokes might be lost on the Cardano community tho so just keep that in mind when picking who your target audience is and who to invite to speak/what to talk about !

Focus on cardano side for marketing and not new users, times suck for bringing new users  in to crypto ...community marketing and creating tools ,with content to share in future to gain more attraction 
Let's focus on simple stuff today, tommorow we will see what happens ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• my 2 cents

Hello, tomorrow is Ergonauts Biweekly day but after last meeting it was proposed to merge with Sigmanauts meeting. Will there be meeting tomorrow or the day is changed?

 I think @dadreboi can answer your question!


[01/10/2023 10:51 AM] Foeniculum#0000
For the next Ergo x Cardano space, the main topic is bridges, interoperability and sidechains

Sebastien from DcSpark/Milkomeda agreed to join as a speaker, would be nice if @mhs_sam and/or @Armeanio could join to speak about Rosen Bridge

Anyone else knowledgeable on the topics above is more than welcome to speak too!

Time/day: edit: Sunday at 7pm UTC seems likely

Forwarded from seedubya: Had the Presearch call this morning (my time) it went well. We are receiving 3 elements to the grant. 

1. The first is $50k worth of advertising on their search engine. The way it works is we are given an account on their platform preloaded with 250,000 'PRE' tokens and you bid on key words. If someone searches that term the site displays our ad on top of returned results. 

The Presearch team will go through our website and white papers etc to give us a list of terms to potentially use. I suggested a number of aspects such as zkp/privacy, pow/mining, defi/lending, bridges etc. 

It's up to us to pick terms we want to use, find a balance of common terms and ones that directly relate to what Ergo is about. We need to have a couple of short descriptions for what Ergo is for the ads

This element runs until we receive 25,000 link clicks. There is no limitation on ad views.

2. The second element is having a site take over. This means the Ergo logo with links on their main page, think google search page with 'google' being replaced with the Ergo logo. This runs for 2 days, I recommended to do this late Feb/March but we can decide when it occurs, I figured to best do it with release of features such as Rosen, Oracles v2, community projects etc. We can decide on the date. This is valued at about $45k

3. The third element is social, cross posting partnership, attend each others AMA's, and a couple of other minor initiatives. 

The team was great to talk to, they will set up and account by late next week with a list of key words for us to choose from, in addition to anything we thing could be relevant!

@seedubya @glasgowm @AngieHar on ErgoHack, what about to have it very generic and name just "CypherPunk Finance" ? 

Which may include (but not limited to):
- research in hardening PoW , L2 
- hardware wallets (I know a guy who is working on Tangem impl for example), physical Erg coins 
- cold wallets
- p2p financial instruments
- community finance
- improving on- and off-ramp (Bisq-like contracts by @MrStahlfelge and so on)
- minimizing trust in cross-chain and off-chain solutions
- PoW-Fi
- experiments in tokenomics
- degen finance 

and so on, so basically filling holes and building where we have half-baked stuff already , also, with catchy name

Is that good idea or bad one? Hahaha

@MrStahlfelge Does Ergo Mobile Wallet have the feature that allows the wallet owners to recover their lost tokens including Erg and Ergopad now?  One Chinese community member still fails to find back his erg and ergopads using his recovery phases after he restored his wallet using Ergo Mobile Wallet last March.


[01/15/2023 10:32 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
The wallet derived addresses as long as transactions are found on the address. But nothing helps when the mnemonic is wrong


[01/15/2023 12:28 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Two questions. 1) Does the Erg and Ergopad tokens appear in the wallet address in explorer. This is to determine if they remain at that address. 2) if so, then the question is access. Do they have the correct seed phrase? If you do not have the correct seed, you cannot spend the funds. If you restored the seed in another wallet and know the spending password, you could send the funds to a new wallet. These are the options.

So, something in the seed is wrong. Most common reason is the seed was either copied or inputted incorrectly. If it were me, I would try entering the seed in Nautilus, which has the nice feature of providing a pulldown list of word choices that help eliminate spelling errors and help you figure out what word it might be if you didn't copy it correctly.

Sigmanauts Meeting Notes 1/15/23

VOICE and Screenshare Recording can be found here: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AxGY_DsTx4tFWqF8wRjEfarK6oGinUKo/view?usp=sharing>

Transcript is at the bottom of the agenda here: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y8qLOIROHMNJpl8xvU01PwhnVUUU2VxMQqL03XhG-1A/edit?usp=sharing>

VOTING PARTICIPATION
- Chris furthered the discussion from last week about EF members voting on proposals as well as the agreed upon sigcan/sigmanaut member voting. 
- qx() volunteered to write a voting proposal that would not just cover this, but all large and influential groups that could come into the ecosystem. For example, broad language to allow sigmanauts to voting power as long as they adhere to the sigmanauts mission. The vote should be up soon.

TRANSPARENCY of SIG PROGRAM
- Chis brought forward some community concerns about them feeling in the dark about sigs. There was much discussion about how best to mitigate this, please look at the transcript or listen to the recording. The summary was that we need to be proactive about the different efforts that are in the Sigmanauts (full in all the way to someone simply participating in chats). If the vote for transparency and posting meeting notes public is passed, that should help a lot as well. 

PRUNING
- Chris brought forward concerns about bad actors in the ecosystem as well as actors that are both sigs and not representing the ERGO. General consensus was that we can adhere people to the sigmanauts mission statement and bring forth discussions when members feel that other members have violated these principals. 

MEETING TIMES PROPOSAL
- qx() had an inquiry about a meeting time that would be more flexible for people. He will send out a link in main chat to get a heatmap on times that work best for everyone (to get more feedback than just people in the meetings).

VOTING
- Seems to be a lul in voting this week even though there are many things to vote on. qx() will DM all sigs to get them to vote before some of the votes expire. 

TWITTER SPACES
- qx() will put out a time suggestion heat map for the first twitter space. Suggested first topics include Introduce the sigs as well as discuss what the sigs are, how to join, how to follow us. 

ONBOARDING
- Kill_it_with_coffee is working on making a very clear landing page for Sigcans/Sigs so that they can get a good feel for what it is to be a sig, he's made great progress this week. The ideas is that one could visit that page as a welcome and have a full idea of what's up, and then, can dive into the HUGE depth of material that has already been there. 

COMMUNITY CALENDAR
- HQ is working on allowing public calendar submissions that members (some sigs or sigcans) can then approve. The display page is very attractive. 

EF
- Angie spoke about some sigmanauts possibly joining in the Contribution telegram channel to help with some editorial aspects, Kill_it_with_coffee Volunteered to test those waters. 
- Angie spoke about the upcoming hackathon and that Sigs should be aware to help promote it as it will be trying for a MUCH broader reach this time outside of the ergo ecosystem.

[01/16/2023 1:58 AM] Rongrong21#0000
LIE IOR's erg and ergopad tokens still cannot be found back with the methods you gave us.


[01/16/2023 2:00 AM] NoahErgo#0000
if he has the seed phrase correct he should be able to restore it. Is it possible he does not have the correct seed phrase?


[01/16/2023 2:00 AM] Rongrong21#0000
His seed phrases were photographed with old phone, so seed phrases are correct.


[01/16/2023 2:01 AM] Rongrong21#0000
I found similar cases in other wallets on other blockchains like Ethereum.


[01/16/2023 2:01 AM] NoahErgo#0000
(re @Rongrong21 : *I found similar cases in other wallets on other blockchains like Ethereum.*) 
 
 it is not the same on ergo


[01/16/2023 2:02 AM] NoahErgo#0000
he should be able to restore the wallet if the seed phrase is correct


[01/16/2023 2:02 AM] Rongrong21#0000
Restored but the wallet address was changed. The original wallet address that holds tokens cannot be found.


[01/16/2023 2:03 AM] NoahErgo#0000
which wallet is he restoring it in


[01/16/2023 2:03 AM] Rongrong21#0000
yoroi, nautilus, ergo mobile wallet and other wallets that support ergs.


[01/16/2023 2:05 AM] NoahErgo#0000
i dont know how to help to be honest


[01/16/2023 2:05 AM] NoahErgo#0000

[01/16/2023 2:07 AM] qx()#0000
(re @Rongrong21 : *yoroi, nautilus, ergo mobile wallet and other wallets that support ergs.*) 
 
 What wallet did he used to use. Did he set it up with a mnemonic password?


[01/16/2023 2:07 AM] Rongrong21#0000
yoroi


[01/16/2023 2:08 AM] Rongrong21#0000
yes, he wrote it down and photographed it with old offline phone.


[01/16/2023 2:09 AM] qx()#0000

can you have him restore it in nautilus, and then have him screenshot a picture if the receive tab, and also the settings window


[01/16/2023 2:14 AM] qx()#0000
looks like he was a miner with about 1gh of power at one point


[01/16/2023 2:15 AM] Rongrong21#0000
ÔΩôÔΩÖÔΩì


[01/16/2023 2:15 AM] qx()#0000
you're 100% sure he used yoroi?


[01/16/2023 2:15 AM] Rongrong21#0000
yes


[01/16/2023 2:15 AM] qx()#0000
and created the seed/wallet on yoroi


[01/16/2023 2:17 AM] Rongrong21#0000
most of us at that time point underwent the bad yoroi wallet use experience when we participated in ergopad staking. Later, we used nautilus. But Lie Ior failed to get back his tokens.


[01/16/2023 2:19 AM] NoahErgo#0000
have him restore in nautlius and screenshot the windows i mentioned before


[01/16/2023 2:19 AM] NoahErgo#0000
otherwise not sure i can help


[01/16/2023 2:20 AM] qx()#0000
yea, follow Noah's advice, Yoroi did not allow for mnemonic password, so, the seed phrase should work if it was the correct one.


[01/16/2023 2:20 AM] qx()#0000
as others have said, type it in as well instead of copy paste

[01/16/2023 2:55 AM] NoahErgo#0000
(re @Rongrong21 : **) 
 
 I think it must be a different address. This wallet already has a bunch of used addresses which means it is not a ‚Äúnew‚Äù wallet address


[01/16/2023 2:56 AM] Rongrong21#0000
Thank you. He still believed that his seed phrases are correct.


[01/16/2023 3:53 AM] Justin1000#0000
(re @Rongrong21 : *Thank you. He still believed that his seed phrases are correct.*) 
 
 Its pretty obvious the most likely issue: He just made a mistake. He took a pic of a seed phrase but somehow it wasn't the one he thought it was and his Ergs are behind a different seed phrase and he simply forgot or didn't even know at the time. He should think back if he took another pic or wrote another one down somewhere else and try to recover from that. This can happen pretty easily (even easier if he created multiple wallets?)...so when doing seed phrases you have to be very deliberate and double check everything and also have some way of remembering what you did in case you need it years later. In setup he should have re-created the wallet on that seed phrase and doublechecked the addresses were same 2x in a row before sending any coins there is another thing. In future he should be more careful.

(re @HQ3rr : *Thoughts on these default pfps to list on ergcube in download portal ?*) 
 
 love the idea! B/w mascot kind of fades in the background, you sure you dont' wanna go for the colored version?


[01/20/2023 6:43 PM] Torto#0000
(re @HQ3rr : *Thoughts on these default pfps to list on ergcube in download portal ?*) 
 
 I like it.  the sigma symbol doesn‚Äôt appear and looks like a rectangular glitch in color on the ergonauta's hand.  

I think I would remove the sigma symbol since it doesn't make that much of a difference.  
Maybe putting the astronauts in the tone of the background colors will be fun.


[01/20/2023 6:47 PM] hq3r#0000
I asked for other artists to contribute and creat a mascot and creat diver version of one

@Ergonauts 
FIRST PUBLIC POSTING OF WEEKLY MEETING
Sigmanauts/Sigcans/Ergonauts meeting 1/22/23

- Welcomed new Sigmanauts and Sigcans: rustinmyeye, kill_it_with_coffee, cheese

- Did a recap of accomplishments since the Zoom meetings started:
    - SigmaVote app for sigmanaut voting and proposals
    - Twitter account (tweetdeck) distributed among a few members to allow for tweeting
    - Twitter account on qx()‚Äôs phone so that it can join and host spaces, which is currently being organized for our first space soon.
    - Ambassador stewardship by Noah and Cran to be mindful of outreach and interactions from like minded chains/projects.
    - Mission statement created and voted into place by sitting sigmanauts
    - Draft/Sample org structure
    - Recording of meetings and publishing in the public channel
    - Logo voting method for Dexy sorted out via HQ‚Äôs ergcube
    - And i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôve forgotten many more‚Ä¶

- Had a fairly long discussion about reaching out to other forms of engagement such as tiktok shorts, youtube shorts. Being fairly up front about the fact that a lot of influencers on the platform are young, physically and or emotionally attractive people, it brought up some interesting points. Also, Coffee will gain access to the Sigs youtube and post short clips of things for quicker engagement. The general consensus was that as Sigmanauts it is our job to hold to the mission of the group. Even if some platforms encourage stretching the truth or making promises not backed up by data, as a sig it is our responsibility to not be sucked into that method and continue to state facts based on data in our outreaches no matter the platform. There will be non sigs that will come along eventually making those videos and that will be plentiful, as it is with other chains.

- Spoke about hosting weekly or bi-weekly spaces with the sigmanauts twitter. Several interested people willing to host/co-host. First space we will reach out to invite Kras (duck pools) as well as talk about the sigs. There was a group heatmap time poll sent out for interested parties and we have a good idea now on when the available times are for hosting it.

- Lots of good ideas about the treasury. Concerns for legal issues as well as perhaps making it fully anon and or DAOs and or WY DAO LLC, many things to consider. Mark suggested the last two. Our next steps were to reach out to ergopad and spectrum to get some guidance on how they leveraged legal in similar matters. Mark suggested playing around with Minotaur and some burner tokens to get the group acquainted on how it functions, Cran said he would front that test Minotaur effort with the help of interested parties.
 
- There was little support and engagement for proposing a new time for these weekly meetings, i will leave the poll up for a bit and advertise it again in case people missed it. 

- Coffee spoke about his ergohack entry and the struggles of finding a dev, check out the video for an overview and his paper, if anyone is interested, please reach out. 

- Angie noted there were also contact info on the last ergohack page if there are any questions about the process/event.

- Angie has many articles in the pipe, one about sigs as well! Please do your best to promote and or tweet these as they come out, community engagement is a quick easy way to have a BIG impact!

- HQ w/ergcube is ready to host the Dexy Logo vote. We will start planning on the social side the tweets leading up to it. Will continue work to the best way to implement his community calendar as well.

- Coffee will start modifying the initial onboarded page in the next few weeks.

Who could speak for Sigfi?

Nothing here suggests lending, might wanna add that and pin a twitter thread explaining exactly what Lithos is about mybe?

 From the litepaper:

‚ÄúCollateralization serves as the second half which backs the Lithos protocol. Collateralizized mining pools allow for local block creation and full censorship resistance. Miners may choose whatever transactions make it into their block, and may also set parameters related to governance of the Ergo blockchain. Collateralization also supports a native DeFi application built into the Lithos protocol, in which lenders provide collateral to miners in return for fees.‚Äù

(re @FoeniculumNFTs : *Nothing here suggests lending, might wanna add that and pin a twitter thread explaining exactly what Lithos is about maybe?*) 
 
 Yeah the lending will be a little different as it‚Äôs backed by PoW but agree it needs to be highlighted more   .  There are several use cases that need to be called out better.  Kirat and I are working on some highlights then plan to include and update our LitePaper.  There is so much value within Lithos that needs to come to the forefront because although it is a mining platform there is so much more for non-miners.


[01/23/2023 3:10 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @HQ3rr : **) 
 
 Something like this could be built once Lithos is fully launched.


[01/23/2023 4:53 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Curious. Why would a lender collateralize the protocol, for a relatively steady stream of income, like an annuity, or some other reason?


[01/23/2023 4:56 PM] NoahErgo#0000
(re  : *<cafebedouin> Curious. Why would I lender collateralize the protocol, for a relatively steady stream if income, like an annuity, or some other reason?*) 
 
 You get a portion of block rewards


[01/23/2023 4:56 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Similar to how mining pools take a cut of fees


[01/23/2023 4:57 PM] K#0000
(re  : *<cafebedouin> Curious. Why would I lender collateralize the protocol, for a relatively steady stream if income, like an annuity, or some other reason?*) 
 
 Steady stream of income from pool fees, can be used to initiate FIMOs for new tokens, loans are about as risk free as they can possibly get (as lenders are paid back using the actual Ergo block reward)


[01/23/2023 4:57 PM] NoahErgo#0000
yep no risk of liquidation


[01/23/2023 4:57 PM] NoahErgo#0000
or anything weird


[01/23/2023 4:59 PM] K#0000
I don't expect people to get any crazy returns on collateralization, however I think it will be a great way to safely and consistently earn 1-3% yield on your ERG


[01/23/2023 4:59 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Good option for risk averse users


[01/23/2023 5:00 PM] NoahErgo#0000
kind of similar to the yamfore model of lending kn cardano, they payback lenders with staking rewards


[01/23/2023 5:12 PM] cafebedouin#9837
There are definitely people that would go for a park and forget staking option. Interesting.

I minted them on Cardano because I think it's a good way to promote Ergo to Cardano users. And  with briding coming soon, it will be possible to port them to Ergo for those who prefer that.


[02/03/2023 1:58 PM] Foeniculum#0000
(re @upwindstrategy : *I minted them on Cardano because I think it's a good way to promote Ergo to Cardano users. And  with briding coming soon, it will be possible to port them to Ergo for those who prefer that.*) 
 
 Love the idea, but how does the promotion actually happen? And also, wouldn't it be better to design something more aesthetically appealing that does represent the techy bits of Ergo you want to promote among the Cardano community?

E.g. a mascot representing oracles, one representing ergoscript and so on

Their metadata can include a description of the bit of Ergo tech they represent

I'd be happy to help, 6 months is more than enough time to create something very unique :)


[02/03/2023 2:09 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
1. Promotion will be automatic because people will see it on Cardano NFT marketplaces and they will ask question to understand what it represents:
"Ergadas celebrate the collaboration between the Ergo and Cardano ecosystems, highlighting both their distinctive qualities and the shared principles that bring them together."

2. The techy bits is another good idea, indeed, but it could be a different project. I chose the way of simplicity, because NFTs are about emotions rather than technical explanations.

3. The 6 months is for tax reasons so I don't have to pay taxes, but the NFTs are already minted.

 1. That seems like a very passive approach, as you're counting a lot on other people's action without a clear way to pull them in; in a space where users are bombarded with information, a more proactive approach would be more efficient

Imo good aesthetics will be more likely to pull them in because that's the first thing they see in an NFT: if they like it, they'll be more motivated to look into what it's all about (and by doing so, they'll have to read the metadata, which will educate them about Ergo)

2. It's hard to convey emotions with something that a user cannot relate to on a physical, psychological or behavioural level (e.g. humans, apes, etc), that's where character design really shines

Sorry if I sound pedantic, I love what you're doing and I'm just trying to give my 2 cents to help you achieve your objective in the most effective way possible ü§ô

[02/03/2023 3:14 PM] Foeniculum#0000
For example, as you can see now there's a strong shift towards streetwear (ORE ORE ORE, Alley Katz), which people tweet about highlighting their relatability to it (e.g. people rocking a Kobe tank top if they're sporty etc)

(re @upwindstrategy : *i'm doing the white list by hand for example, only to real people I know that are really interest, no impersonal minting tool to a hord of flippers.*) 
 
 I think we're talking about two different things: 

I'm talking about how to make it easier for people to get attracted to the NFTs to the point where they'll want to read about what they represent (i.e. Ergo tech) rather than the logistics behind it (which, as you mentioned, is very straightforward and perfect as it is)

 Do you suggest replacing the current pictures with something new?


[02/03/2023 3:33 PM] Foeniculum#0000
(re @upwindstrategy : *Do you suggest replacing the current pictures with something new?*) 
 
 Yessir; considering you have a 6 months window, we can easily do something a bit more visually elaborated

E.g. we can set specific objectives (e.g. who we're targeting, how to represent Ergo tech in a visually appealing and relatable way) and define a strategy to achieve them

You have a great reputation in the Cardano community, so whatever you'll do will definitely attract the right eyes to it; the better we define the above, the more likely your project is gonna benefit Ergo imo


[02/03/2023 3:34 PM] Foeniculum#0000
No well known people on Cardano have ever done anything like this for Ergo before, and I'm really grateful for what you're doing and think it can have great results; now you see why I'm so emotionally invested in this ü§£


[02/03/2023 3:37 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
Yeah, it's been a lot of work, also because I wanted to include something else in it which was very time consuming already. But it was too complex for a first collection. These are probably good enough to be the equivalent of little "Berrys". Other art would then be another project that would need to be conceptualised from scratch, in addition to this one. I'm certainly open to any ideas on that matter  if it can help Ergo of course.


[02/03/2023 3:38 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
For the moment, I see already quite a good interest for the whitelist, so it's difficult to say to people interested in this that I will give them something else.


[02/03/2023 3:40 PM] Foeniculum#0000

[02/03/2023 3:43 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
For a first collection, yes. I hope I'll learn a few things and I have also a lot of other free work I do already for the communities I'm in, and my time is a bit limited, but tried to do as much as I can while being on many fronts.

@Ergonauts 

Meeting Notes 2/5/23:

**ERGOHACK VI Marketing Support**
Noah offered to get a list of dev‚Äôs to reach out to (we can possibly use the Sigmanauts twitter) to invite them to check out the i need a team channel in discord as well as submit a proposal. 
Signanauts twitter will post daily updates from the team channels in a single post to help with exposure (assuming teams are updating the channels with progress).

**Temp Multisig Wallet**
The wallet has been created. We will send a few tests to make sure we have controlling functionality of it before putting any significant funds in it.
All users are anon to each other, will check with them in the next few days to see if they are ok with me giving the list of their usernames to one other person (NOAH) for the sake of wallet recovery.

**SIGMAVOTE**
Finishing up programming this week
When system is live again the following will occur
- Sigmanauts and Sigcans can simply bring in (sponsor) a sigcan, no voting needed, just ask Glasgow or qx() for discord permissions and announcement for the new person
- Vote weekend will occur at the end of each month
- Submissions will be disabled a week before voting happens each month
- All votes pass if there are any ‚Äúyes‚Äù votes and no ‚Äúno‚Äù votes. If there are any no votes the vote is on hold for a discussion at the next weekly where a quorum shall be had on whether to pass or fail. 

**Understanding SigmaUSD/RSV, DEXY**
Discussed that we should all do our best to understand it as best we can so that we can help out on twitter, chats, reddit, etc‚Ä¶
Same goes for some of the dapps. The better we understand it all, the better we can help out in the ecosystem
qx() working on a graphic for sigRSV and DEXY, RSV already done, dexy next, will drop in chat at some point. 

**Kushti**
Working on polishing DEXY
For marketing support there is the "Assumptions" article he wrote recently that we can promote

Know Your Assumptions
This topic is going to provide affrmative answers to few important questions  which seem to be largely ignored in the cryptocurrency industry, despite the  fact that the questions are very basic ones, and, in our opinion, existence of  the industry is heavily relying on them.

Ergada Discord server has now almost 1K members in just a few days. (https://discord.gg/ergada)

The demand and enthusiasm of the community exceeds all expectations, which is great! Thank you to all who supported the idea from start.

I created a channel called "ergo-ressources" that links to the main websites to learn more about Ergo. If anyone wants to check there and wants to add something, or if something needs to be corrected, feel free to let me know.

 Will there be any usefulness to these aside from speculation?


[02/06/2023 5:19 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I mean no disrespect but i imagine the community interest is likely because you are an nft whale and people are hoping to piggyback and make some profit


[02/06/2023 8:41 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *Will there be any usefulness to these aside from speculation?*) 
 
 No planned usefulness, but open to ideas.


[02/06/2023 8:43 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
For the moment the big question is how to distribute them.


[02/06/2023 8:46 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
The basic idea is that we will have special access to special holders channel in the discord. That will be the first one for sure, and if it can help promote Ergo to the Cardano community in a fun way, then I would also be very happy. I already see a lot of interest.

Hello everybody, I was talking to Eric (CEO at Godwoken, DevRel at Nervos) and he wants to reach out at someone in management in Ergo to talk about development. 
So this is a message to let you know he's legit (prob going to reach out to @glasgowm & @Armeanio)
But since he asked, if anyone is more particularly interested you could? @kushti_ru @mhs_sam @anon_br @DanielTetsuyama ?
His handle on twitter is @TheVanderWal

 PPC is a fun one üòÇ the tricky part is to figure out a different bundle of keywords for each stage of the customer journey

Forwarded from ericatnervos: Hi Mark. I hope you dont mind me reaching out via Telegram. I am the CEO of Godwoken Blockchain. We are the EVM L2 for Nervos, where I was formerly the director of developer relations and support engineering. 

We were the first team to build optimistic rollup outside of the Ethereum ecosystem and first EVM L2 on a UTXO blockchain (Nervos). 

I am currently reaching out to a few other UTXO chains to test the waters around build EVM L2s for them.

Hey all. I really have a desire to improve explorer's user experience so I'll try to get funding one more time üòä 

We at Labs would like to propose a new design for the explorer UX/UI for our ecosystem on Ergohack VI. If we win it, we will deliver a high-quality explorer UX/UI to the EF team as Figma files. Our output will include:
- A design system for all the UI components for the explorer app, including charts
- The most common use cases, such as searching for tokens, viewing a single transaction, viewing a list of transactions, and viewing an address state

We would like to inquire about the following prior to proceeding:
1. Are UX/UI proposals accepted, or only coding proposals are accepted?
2. @Dmitry Usov , do you have the time to create a new UI kit and explorer screens?


[02/08/2023 8:04 PM] eilemust#0000

 We created a system few years back for stuff like this , we had a dam leak and few provinces of Spain were almost drowned , 
Consists in : 
- Convert local places or shops into a small Wearhouse where people can can leave food or things needed. Things are sorted in boxes..
- we use local private ambulances to take stuff to near airport (if there isn't enough money for cargo,we send a big trucks or ambulances )
- ones they reach the destiny, we have a stand with red cross where the things get distributed


[02/12/2023 9:12 AM] hq3r#0000
All the economical donations go to a bank account which geta converted into "affected area,local needs"


[02/12/2023 9:13 AM] hq3r#0000
This time we had to be carefull to not sent any pork food or things which contain port, just to respect the ethnicity of people ... So,sometimes it's easier to buy there and provide then exporting from spain

Cardano had an upgrade today that allows Plutus language to "easily verify transactions from other blockchains using ECDSA and Schnorr standards."
https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/about/secp

Ergo uses ECDSA and Schnor (https://docs.ergoplatform.com/crypto/#crypto-primitives)

Might be an area to explore for any projects interacting with cardano such as spectrum or rosen @oskin @mhs_sam 

Maybe it's not relevant but if it isn't you can tell me so :D

Hi guys, I found many coins/tokens have been listed on Weiss Ratings. Why not request Wessis Ratings to list ERG there?


[02/19/2023 12:45 PM] Rongrong21#0000
Many crypto citizens will check the rating of a coin/token before they buy them from Weiss Ratings. If ERG is listed there and get a high rating, more people will find out erg and show interest in Ergo.


[02/19/2023 12:47 PM] Rongrong21#0000
In addition to Erg, other ergo tokens may be listed there if possible.

(re @koutelier : *This is just my personal view though I don‚Äôt know if I am right or wrong.*) 
 
 I agree, although I also think Grand Gambit guy would raise some capital if he did an IDO with Ergopad.

I dont know why he doesn't do it, projects create a token without even having an MVP launched and raise a lot of money for their development yet he has a working product, a decent one actually and decides not to.

Maybe he just doesn't know how tokenizing a project works and doesn't really worries him, however he has been a great addition to the evosystem, he is doing good despite his low budget

@dadreboi  tipped me 1k love yesterday want to giveaway  to the community and the only option I see reliable rn is talking to ergone guys and airdrop love to all who provide content and marketing on socials , I know it's not a huge number of tokens but will help ergone too .. thoughts?


[02/22/2023 11:45 AM] hq3r#0000
@tefcek21  I think ergopad can use ergone too, not sure if it's as effective as crew3 but you reward those who market your product

[02/22/2023 3:43 PM] koutelier#0000
Forwarded from lano_p: The Cardano tip bot has a rain function. You can rain x amount of Hosky for all users that were in the chat in the last y hours.
Some people tip it back or rain it back and others cash it in. This creates activities in the chat and some use for the token.
Might be something to look into here as well.


[02/22/2023 3:43 PM] koutelier#0000
@LuivatraEP maybe this will keep activity up? Is this doable time wise?


[02/22/2023 3:45 PM] Luivatra#0000
hmm, possible sure, no time for it right now but could look into it when I finally get to the tip bot refactor I have been wanting to do. But will it give valuable activity? I have grown quite allergic to airdrop hunters

My pushing mood is on again, how are we doing with dexy? :) @kushti_ru @Armeanio


[02/28/2023 3:50 PM] hq3r#0000
Been brainstorming on the influencers payment stuff and have reached the conclusion of using ergonames
Example :
Lilly created a video and says , I will be givingaway X amount of erg / nft or anything  to make attractive deal for users , go and  mint $lilly#000- limit  (we set up) 
How do we fund this?
By providing marketing to ergo and ergonames, we can ask them from a cut on the mint price and pay the influencer with that %
let's suppose if minting is 1 Erg and 100 ergonames are minted  , we ask for 10% of total 100 erg = 10erg from ergnames and pay influencer  doing simple division of 10/100 = 0.1 erg/ mint 
What future usercase can this bring?
Influencers know who there supporter's are, they can just input ergonames in sender field and airdrop stuff to people , can be usefull for future tooling too...for whitelisting  etc
Been in touch with mgpai and he sees this as a potencial marketing strategy too and requires more opinions from you guys  @dadreboi @ergomergoadargo @NoahErgo

[02/28/2023 6:44 PM] AngieHar#0000
my 2 cents is that working with influencers more effective planning a campaign of more than 5 channels, than having just one for a specific reason 
they can be small, but in this terms you mix audiences and the conversion rate is higher, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs better to have a news and plan 5 to 10 channels to drop up their content and spread within their media 
just in this case the product can see the outcome from the campaign 
but anyway testing

https://docs.ergoplatform.com/dev/Integration/guide/ is probably the best resource? exodus repo appears to be mostly JS so maybe nautilus too. 

I believe the indexed node also helps alleviate the need for an explorer at all in a wallet. Can just discover nodes

A Chinese member complained that he received too few SPF token airdrops.


[03/03/2023 3:08 AM] Rongrong21#0000
He said that Uni dydx won great exposure in the crypto space by airdropping a lot of tokens.


[03/03/2023 3:11 AM] Rongrong21#0000
I think it is necessary to take similar actions to attract new users to  follow Spectrum and then Ergo after spf ido on Cardano.  Although the new users of spectrum is rewarded by airdrops, it is also important to attract new users to understand Spectrum and participate in Ergo ecosystem by airdropping tokens to new users.


[03/03/2023 3:27 AM] NoahErgo#0000
The terms of the airdrop have been know for a long time. If you think more should be sent feel free to make your own and send it with ergo utils


[03/03/2023 3:27 AM] NoahErgo#0000
sounds to me like somebody complaining they didnt get enough free money


[03/03/2023 3:29 AM] Rongrong21#0000
Sorry for my unclear description. I just got a marketing idea from his complaint that we should attract more users to ergo ecosystem by airdropping some tokens to new users.


[03/03/2023 3:31 AM] NoahErgo#0000
Its ok i was being a jerk about it. Sorry üòÖ


[03/03/2023 3:32 AM] NoahErgo#0000
Have seen a lot of people begging for more airdrop


[03/03/2023 3:38 AM] Rongrong21#0000
Airdrop can increase the exposure of a project. Maybe, we can hold a Q&A event that requires the new users to answer what is Spectrum, what is Ergo and what projects have been or are being built on Ergo before airdropping tokens. We can airdrop tokens to the new comers who provide correct answers.


[03/03/2023 3:46 AM] Rongrong21#0000
Perhaps, a knowledge contest about Spectrum and Ergo can be held to let the existing and/or new user fully understand Spectrum and Ergo. The people who won the first, second and third places will be rewarded with some airdropped tokens. However, we need to prepare a question bank to conduct such contest.


[03/03/2023 3:51 AM] Rongrong21#0000
We can judge whether they are new users or not according to the time when they joins telegram groups.


[03/03/2023 3:51 AM] NoahErgo#0000
I think probably spectrum team has considered their airdrop very carefully at this point but a community organized thing is possible if you want to do that


[03/03/2023 8:08 AM] Gazza_SP#0000
The airdrop was based on a pretty fair calculation on how much people traded and added liquidity by ERG weight over the life of the DEX, if people just traded for example 0.01 erg 1000 times the airdrop was tiny, otherwise it would have went entirely to airdrop hunters who did try and game it shortly after announcement. I think airdrops are also not a good marketing tool at this point. Brings the wrong type of people to the community that couldn't care less about the product. They spam the chats and make it impossible to have a real conversation for weeks on end making the project look like a scam half the time.


[03/03/2023 11:33 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Agree with Gazza. Airdrops and rewards are probably more trouble than they are worth for projects.


[03/03/2023 11:42 AM] Gazza_SP#0000
I guess on the flip side, for us it did prove useful for stress testing the protocol, but for purely marketing it's not the most effective tool


[03/03/2023 11:44 AM] yashablack#0000
(re @Rongrong21 : *I think it is necessary to take similar actions to attract new users to  follow Spectrum and then Ergo after spf ido on Cardano.

 The prelaunch phase is over. Time is already lost.
All future airdrops will be giving away other users' money to new users, which contradicts our vision
If he wanna earn tokens he can provide liquidity or stake liquidity (super soon) and deserve them. We do not engage in manipulation and subtle tricks.
There will be many more opportunities to get a token, but never for free. You have to participate in the community to get something back from it. Everything else is stupid gambling. We don't need gamblers, let them go to sports betting.


[03/03/2023 11:45 AM] yashablack#0000
The value is not in the token, but in the protocol and services it brings to the table. Our task is to explain those values properly, so that new people understand them and decide to join


[03/03/2023 11:50 AM] yashablack#0000
The idea is that the token is the lifeblood of the protocol. It is not an investment instrument or a securitization tool. New features will be added gradually. In general, the token is needed to be spent (utilize) within the protocol, nothing more or less.
Maybe I don't understand something, please explain if this is the case.


[03/03/2023 12:04 PM] Rongrong21#0000
Just a marketing idea to attract more users. A small amount of tokens may be used to direct crypto guys to Spectrum Community and Ergo ecosystem. For example, 20000 tokens may be issued to 10000  Erg-supported wallet addresses of those new comers who join the telegram group for spectrum. In this process, people have to learn how to download Ergo wallets and use Spectrum DEX before they can sell these tokens. If some guys are speculators and just want to receive the airdropped tokens, they still remember the Spectrum DEX when Ergo and Spectrum become very famous in the crypto space. Most importantly, i believe many of them will stay in the Spectrum community and can follow what is happening in Spectrum community. I think it is necessary to have a test.


[03/03/2023 12:11 PM] qx()#0000
The allocation I received was more than fair and even too much for doing nothing but trading. Paying for exposure for a dex that most of those people won‚Äôt even use except to cash out their airdrop is a marketing event that should be analyzed with metrics, not with complaints from airdrop ‚Äútesters‚Äù who say they didn‚Äôt get enough. As someone who has provided sole LP for a swap pair you come to realize what‚Äôs happening when u cash out your airdrop pretty quickly. IMHO there are better ways to burn through your funds than to satiate people with free but not really free money. I could be wrong, but where are all the airdroppers from the last big event where the channels were flooded? Most didn‚Äôt stay‚Ä¶


[03/03/2023 12:13 PM] qx()#0000
Look at anetabtc. Lots of giveaways and a huge Twitter following. Most of the people complained until they received their free aneta or tosi and then didn‚Äôt stick around.


[03/03/2023 12:14 PM] qx()#0000
And I can speak to those metrics since I did some of the airdrops.


[03/03/2023 12:16 PM] Rongrong21#0000
The key purpose of the marketing idea is not to give more tokens to  existing users, it is just to attract new users by airdrop. We can consider these airdrop tokens as a marketing fee to attract more users to know Spectrum and how to use it. If they are interested in spectrum and believe that Spectrum has a bright future in the crypto space, they may buy more spf tokens.


[03/03/2023 12:17 PM] qx()#0000
Yah. I‚Äôm saying unless you have metrics to prove otherwise, the probability of those airdroppers staying is super low.


[03/03/2023 12:19 PM] qx()#0000

Gaining attraction Is not hard these day, it's cheap... We have am example of Paideia airdrop giveaway post in twitter which surprasses almost all generic traffic of ergoplatform ... Finding genuine users Is a hard task to achieve , airdrops being useless bots and maybe few genuine potencial users , but to make them stay, you have to have a am product ready to Sell them... Sadly, spf Is just a token now .

@yashablack @Gazza_SP  question, Is yield farming somehow profitable for "wallets" to have there own liquidity pools?
 Example :
Exodus has it's own liquidity pools inside the wallet app , were you dep√≥sit x amount of x token and user gets rewards from it  and exodus as lp operator get % of it?
Can be nice way to attract More wallets


[03/04/2023 9:40 AM] Gazza_SP#0000
You mean just have a UI interface for spectrum inside wallets like mosaik? Not sure if it would be any more profitable as it will be possible to access with all wallets anyway

[03/04/2023 9:48 AM] Gazza_SP#0000

 I know minting there own tokens and creating lp can be chaotic and rugpulls but i think Someone like this can be done for wallet providers ... We know that "charge %" on tx's ... But giving them another option to win More and giving option to there users of providing liquidity can be very helpfull for dex and whole ecosystem

 1 thing to understand is `your can use protocol from any UI which is connected to the protocol wheather it app.spectrum.fi or any other`

Answering your question -- you can do it. Here is a guide:
1. Create a liquidity pool via SF UI
2. Attract liquidity or add it yourself
3. Create a farm via SF UI
4. Go to your wallet app
5. Install @ergolabs/ergo-dex-sdk (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ergolabs/ergo-dex-sdk) package
6. Use the package to create all needed UI elements and operations
*7. Also you can add swap form and pass an address to TX builder to earn more from UI fees

 Liquidity Is a future plan to give More visibility and utility to Rosen Bridge , i Guess you can't swap erg to Any other non ergo native Co√≠n inside wallets right now.. only pairs available on cexes are  btc,eth and usdt right?

Something like this could be attractive for different projects (including wallets) I suppose

 Exodus is closed source so impossible to know the dynamics of the swap. Could be fair, could be they have a finger in the pie. 

Generally I think the assumption should be if there is an economic attack vector in a black box assume it is happening as there is a profit incentive.

[03/04/2023 4:47 PM] Armeanio#0000
Well the first is to integrate support the network. 

Then custom work is possible. I imagine when we see than on the cardano side, since they are much larger that opportunity will be possible. For ergo itself I would assume the time/resources needed is a harder sell due to size and liquidity.


[03/04/2023 4:47 PM] Armeanio#0000
For spectrum specifically cardano integration would probably appear first.

 Okay. I'd like to.  However, my ability of  understanding your discussions is poor because before I joined ergonauts I am a text translator between English and Chinese. I got to know ergo by translating an announcement about ergo's partnership with emurgo in oracle pools in early 2020.

 This kind of looks like what DeCo is building here

https://deco-education.github.io/deco-docs/docs/intro/

There‚Äôs also the basic intro tut here: https://docs.ergoplatform.com/dev/stack/basics/

But can make a general 1-page descriptive intro on the docs. Would be good to do an education push or maybe ergohack at some point to get more of the developer community involved as feels a bit fragmented atm

I've been thinking of learning Ergoscript & Scala. What do you see as the equivalent of "Project Based Python Programming" for Ergo?

The Ergo Manifesto is a kind of philosophical executive summary. Do you think "Manifesto for a Democratic Civilization" by Ocalan, is a good source for theory? Or, do you prefer something else? How about you @glasgowm, anything foundational in the Agorist theory canon that you think all devs should read?

Also, as a practical question, do most devs working in Ergo use Intellij, or are there alternatives? I've read no one serious programs Scala with emacs.

I'll take a look at whatever is recommended and see if I can understand enough to write something like thus DarkFi Hacker's Study Guide for people new to programming, software development and/or Scala. I won't be able to do much but preliminary reading before April.

There's a lot going on in Intellij. Makes the learning curve steeper. I'll also try your set-up. I think presenting different coding environments is important, but it needs to be updated frequently since it evolves so much.

[03/15/2023 7:52 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Right. Just looking at the Darkfi Agorism Hacker's Study guide kushti linked to and they are focusing on the philosophy, or why, or learning to program. In this context it would be in the spirit of being a full "citizen", with the ability to be more involved.


[03/15/2023 7:54 PM] cafebedouin#9837
It directly references "Manifesto for a Democratic Civilization" by Ocalan. Link is broken but I went ahead and bought the first volume. Then, it talks about a standard Python learning text. So, trying to adapt the format to Ergo in my mind. People tend to discount theory, but it is often important to the "why" of deciding to do something, like learning to code Scala/Ergoscript.

 Yeah just not sure what would be appreciated ropriate that wasn't heavy on the politics side (ie an agorists primer). 

Towards a private digital economy is what hooked me, that and a few other options here

Bite-sized ideology on its own path with bite-sized code. Maybe combine like a crypto version of the Quaker Faith & Practice. I'm sure that sounds like an abomination, and it might be! Just seems like someone trying to code might turn into a how to of sorts, assuming they have an ideological bent. Anyway, I like the idea, and will look into whether I can write something useful. I'll probably also do some editing of the Ergo documentation, while I'm in there.

We're still gathering results from judges. The process has been greatly simplified but with the quality and difference in proposal I think it's fitting to give judges time to go through and allocate time to each project to just on each's merit

 Sorry for failure to attend the meeting tonight. I am very tired now because of a very busy day. My suggestions are below:

Irrespective of pictures, articles, tweets or amas, Twitter space or youtube videos, I hope that these contents are easily understood by regular people without technical knowledge about cryptos  and blockchains. We should let regular people easily know what is ergo and what revolutionary things ergo will bring to the regular people.

Additionally, I hope there's a big picture that can connect all components of the  blockchain industry based on ergo show how they are interacting with one another and what roles they play. The big picture named Qingmingshanghetu  shows the economy status of  the song dynasty. We can understand what was happening in song through the big picture. Similarly, the big picture showing ergo-centric blockchain world will make people easily understand what is going on in the blockchain world. These components may include ergo platform itself as underlying blockchain, oracle pools, Rosen bridge, wallets, dex, launchpad, ntf marketplaces, ergo mixer and so on.  If this big picture is created, it may become one of the most valuable nft works because it witnesses the growth history of ergo or even the development history of the blockchain industry.

 Keep doing what we‚Äôre doing but it‚Äôs easier?, focus more on marketing and increase spending there in line with price rises. Pull in the masses from ADA with rosen and any other routes we can.

It would be cool to take immediate  collective actions to push the ecosystem together.

 Yep I‚Äôve been putting feelers out to cypherpunk/privacy groups but ADA will be the bulk of it with the upcoming bridge. Then we can push BNB/BTC/ETH or whatever bridge is live next

(re @glasgowm : *Yep I‚Äôve been putting feelers out to cypherpunk/privacy groups but ADA will be the bulk of it with the upcoming bridge. Then we can push BNB/BTC/ETH or whatever bridge is live next*) 
 
 small blockchains might help ergo more? since they need marketing as well, that way since ergo is superior ergo can be a bridge in communication and building dapps in various blockchains ?


[03/21/2023 3:01 PM] koutelier#0000
for example we attract blockchain A that doesn't have smart contracts and we introduce them the bridge and the ability to build dapps that users will be able to use their coin to interact ?

(re @NoahErgo : *@yashablack do you have any suggestions for onboarding new devs from other ecosystems? I tried to contact many during ergohack5 and was not really successful*) 
 
 as much as more devs is great, I would argue we need more users first, we have way more functionality than many much larger blockchains, we need more users to bring life to the existing dapps and more liquidity to support more devs


[03/21/2023 3:06 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
Yeah liquidity is by far the biggest issue on ergo now, there's just not enough to go around all the existing dapps


[03/21/2023 3:06 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
Rosen is the best shot at bringing liquidity in the immediate future though from Cardano


[03/21/2023 3:06 PM] glasgowm#0000
(re @koutelier : *for example we attract blockchain A that doesn't have smart contracts and we introduce them the bridge and the ability to build dapps that users will be able to use their coin to interact ?*) 
 
 Sounds good, ADA/BTC/ETH provide more value initially tho. Need to get erg on some dex‚Äôs and ADA alone should help massively with accessibility as we can just tell people to swap ADA on spectrum rather than having to pick a CEX. 

Nothing stopping smaller chains from starting to build those integrations themselves tho if they‚Äôre keen.


[03/21/2023 3:08 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
I am hopeful a lot of cardano people will jump onto ergo DeFi once the bridge is complete, I've talked alot about ergo on a bunch of cardano Twitter spaces and there's always huge interest


[03/21/2023 3:08 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
Just need to make it even more accessible than it currently is, for some reason a lot of cardano people have the idea that erg is impossible to buy since it's not on binance üòÇ

Isn't the problem that when I do that, there's a change box created with all NFTs in it that goes back also to myself, and instead of creating 2 or more change boxes and splitting them into them, Nautilus tries to pack all these 205 NFTs into one signel box, so the transaction doesn't pass because one box can't have so many NFTs in it.

On Cardano, I've the impression that the wallets create boxes in which the user can decide how many assets you have in, usually 20 is a good number. That's done automatically at each transaction.

I think the ability to have all NFTs like that together is nice to show collections. And for example, for the ape society, we have non custodial staking and I have to have all TAS assets in the same wallet to be able to use them in the game.


[03/22/2023 7:13 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
The frames for example, can be used only by the wallet that minted them.


[03/22/2023 7:17 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
I struggle also quite a lot on Cardano, but that gave me some experience also, which can be interesting, specially as Ergo will have more usecases and will probably have to be able to manage these cases.

Eternl has a good understanding of these issues. They are working on an upgrade soon that will resolve some problems they currently have with memory, but even on Cardano, I have to use several wallets depending on what I'm doing.


[03/22/2023 7:19 PM] Luivatra#0000
can certainly be solved by the wallet, just need to split the boxes up like you already said, I do wonder how the cardano ledger implementation works with so many though


[03/22/2023 7:19 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
When I'm doing many transactions one after the other (on Cardano you can only mint one asset at a time), then I usually prefer Nami that has less options but calculates the transactions more quickly. Eternl is more powerful, but it tends to use a lot of computer ressources and takes much longer to open the transaction window.


[03/22/2023 7:52 PM] qx()#0000
i wonder if the only way out of this is a custom tx to three different wallets


[03/22/2023 8:01 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @upwindstrategy : **) 
 
 That‚Äôs really strange, transaction builder must split change boxes with max tokens limit per box


[03/22/2023 8:01 PM] nemo429#0000
Let me do some investigation


[03/22/2023 8:01 PM] Luivatra#0000
But how much nanoerg in each change box?


[03/22/2023 8:04 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @LuivatraEP : *But how much nanoerg in each change box?*) 
 
 0.001, if memory serves well, but probably not enough for a box with 120 tokens


[03/22/2023 8:07 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @upwindstrategy : *still same problem*) 
 
 Hmm, probably transaction builder is splitting correctly but not inserting enough erg (more than 0.001) on change boxes with many tokens


[03/22/2023 8:07 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
(re @nemo429 : *Hmm, probably transaction builder is splitting correctly but not inserting enough erg (more than 0.001) on change boxes with many tokens*) 
 
 no, there 9 ERG in the big box


[03/22/2023 8:07 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
but there's more than 120 in this box


[03/22/2023 8:08 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
note that i have the same problem with safew


[03/22/2023 8:08 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @upwindstrategy : *no, there 9 ERG in the big box*) 
 
 Yeah, but these 9 ERG are going to the external address, the problem is in change


[03/22/2023 8:13 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @upwindstrategy : *note that i have the same problem with safew*) 
 
 That‚Äôs hard to replicate, change splitting in transactions with 120+ tokens is something well tested, but this issue with not enough ERG for change is new to me. Should be easy to fix, but changes will be published in one or two days due to google‚Äôs review.

Have you tested it with Ergo Mobile Wallet? It uses a different transaction builder implementations so must worth a try.


[03/22/2023 8:20 PM] upwindstrategy#0000
(re @nemo429 : *Yeah, but these 9 ERG are going to the external address, the problem is in change*) 
 
 no, 9 ERG is in change coming back


[03/22/2023 8:21 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @upwindstrategy : *no, 9 ERG is in change coming back*) 
 
 Are you able to see the change boxes in the transaction review screen?


[03/22/2023 8:24 PM] nemo429#0000
If you enable dev mode in settings you can see the transaction json object, would be helpful to see how much change boxes are present

[03/22/2023 8:39 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @upwindstrategy : *ok great thank you :)*) 
 
 No problem, for now you can try to avoid using more than one input by sending it to another wallet with a minimum of 0.001 ERG to see what happens, if the input that contains the token you are trying to send contains enough erg to pay the fee, and send the change it will probably work

[03/22/2023 9:20 PM] nemo429#0000
BTW, please be careful while using SAFEW with too many NFTs, it still uses a bugged version of sigma-rust which caused a big NFT burning incident some time ago.

Hi guys, I just translated this picture and got an idea that we should create more similar pictures for ergo and its ecosystem projects and make an album so that the readers can understand ergo by reading a picture book. I think this action will make regular people better understand ergo.


[03/28/2023 7:22 AM] Rongrong21#0000
In my opinion, due to the complicity of blockchain technologies, it is hard to make regular people understand Ergo quickly and easily. If we create a picture book for them, just like creating English picture books for children, regular people can understand Ergo and its ecosystem  projects easily and quickly.

i have two stupid ideas. First does ergo has any marketing plans for 1st of april ?


[03/29/2023 4:11 PM] koutelier#0000
also chatgpt is hot lately . maybe we could use this for ergo marketing. Maybe integrating chatgpt to a smart contract or something and then market it ?

smart contract getting a data pull from an oracle that gets it from chatgpt?

is that even possible without offchain code?

`Yes, it is possible to integrate ChatGPT to a blockchain node. However, the specifics of the integration would depend on the blockchain network you are using and the type of node you want to integrate ChatGPT with.

Here are some general steps you could follow to integrate ChatGPT to a blockchain node:

Determine the use case: Determine how you want to use ChatGPT in conjunction with the blockchain node. For example, you might want to use ChatGPT to provide conversational interfaces to blockchain applications, or to analyze transaction data and provide insights.

Identify the appropriate APIs: Depending on the use case, you may need to use different APIs to integrate ChatGPT to the blockchain node. For example, you might need to use the blockchain node's API to access transaction data or execute smart contracts, and ChatGPT's API to perform natural language processing.

Develop the integration: Once you have identified the appropriate APIs, you can develop the integration. This might involve writing custom code or using existing libraries to interface with both the blockchain node and the ChatGPT API.

Test and deploy: After the integration is developed, you can test it to ensure that it is functioning as expected. Once you are satisfied with the results, you can deploy the integration to the blockchain node and begin using it in production.

Overall, integrating ChatGPT to a blockchain node can enable a wide range of conversational and analytical capabilities for blockchain applications. By providing natural language interfaces to blockchain data and functionality, ChatGPT can help increase accessibility, usability, and adoption of blockchain technology.

`or

`One way to achieve secure and decentralized storage with Ergo blockchain and ChatGPT is by using a combination of smart contracts and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) or another decentralized storage system. Here's how it could work:

I swear, people using ChatGPT sound like Joey finding out about the thesaurus


[03/29/2023 4:25 PM] koutelier#0000
for april 1st ergo could say a lie that might go viral

example 1.

Tweet: Just in.
Ergo network halted

and after few hours/min post an article about why this is unlikely to happen

example 2.

Tweet: Ergo network rewards miners with $ETH 

Average fee per tx now is at 150$

example 3:
Tweet: 

Ergo Blockchain just announced our new initiative to mine cryptocurrency using hamster wheels! Say goodbye to expensive mining equipment 

example 4
Tweet:

We're excited to announce our latest partnership - Ergo Blockchain x $COMET x Ergdoge! Together, we're taking cryptocurrency to the moon


Drama is more likely to go viral than genuine articles also it would be april fools  lol

I love the Cardashift team. They're very strong and deeply connected to the real world with their non-Web 3 companies.

Another Cardano company moving to Polygon is not a good sign.

some simple stuff still sucks in cardano, try yourself with having a wallet in different wallets like yoroi, flint, nami. In each wallet, you'll have different bad experiences with your assets, tokens, fee calculation, min ada, etc

transfer tracking UI is not ready yet, so it's not easy for you to track your transfer process. I'll provide some APIs and steps for those interested to dive in.


[03/29/2023 8:05 PM] mhs_sam#0000
also, test tokens are not registered in cardano-token-registry (I told you about the bad UXüòÅ) so you will see 1 Erg to be wrapped as 10^9 RST_ERG (wallets cannot distinguish decimals). 
it will be sorted out later since we'll register the tokens.

I can get Chinese answers about ergo from chatgpt. However, I will have more talks with chatgpt to correct its answers about ergo and its ecosystem projects in Chinese so that chatgpt can provide correct answers to other people who are interested in ergo when they heard of ergo and these new potential users can better understand ergo through talking with chatgpt. I think this a free marketing channel for ergo to enable new users to understand ergo

        Listing erg on okx is important because okx got a license in Hongkong, which means more Chinese individuals or organizations can invest in cryptos via okx. If erg is listed there, more fund may come to erg.


[03/31/2023 6:13 PM] marty_ergopad#0000

It can lead to other listings too for any token


[03/31/2023 6:18 PM] Rongrong21#0000
Gateio likes to list new tokens because it is famous for listing as many as different tokens among cexes. That is to say, many new tokens can be found on Gateio while they cannot  be found on  other cexes

        Yep, before any discussions begin there is the whole NDA ordeal. 

There is always the line "we don't charge listing fees" but they certainly have hefty a "marketing fee" to make up for it.

Crowdfunding could be a way to raise capital for listings with a slight hurdle on not being able to specify actual amount to raise. Could say a round number like $1m to be used for listings

There is also a potential liability listing in the US with uncertainty going on at the moment with a crack down on exchanges, SEC fines, crypto banking rails, regulation uncertainty and all that.

Hate for something to go ahead, spend significant amount of Treasury or crowd funded monies only to be rugged by some action in the US

        sorry, i am sick these days. My marketing ideas are as follows.

Thanks for amazing pictures about ergo recently published.


I think we should make beautiful leaflets based on these pictures and even print them so that all community members can show these leaflets to other crypto people when they attend offline crypto events in the countries or regions  where such offline events are permitted.

My second idea is that ergo doesn't have an official ad video. I think it is necessary to create a long ad video.

Well, I tried to convince some admins of Hispanic channels but looks like there is not interest, I will personally do "ergo cardano ecosystem" in Spanish in upcoming weeks , already got in touch with 4 different pools and fre Spanish ambastors of cardano ... If there is any Spanish guy who want to help, let me know ‚ù§Ô∏è

Hi ergonauts, I think it is very necessary to write and publish a series of articles introducing our smart developers like kushti and Alex Slesarenko and other developers. In the past, I just got to know that Kushti published many blockchain research articles. Now, I got to know Alex Slesarenko. He published so many patents.  That is amazing. Please try to find out more gem-like developers from our dev community and let the community know the power of our development teams including ergo core developer and ergo ecosystem developers.

Do you know the answer to this question by chance?


[04/04/2023 8:45 AM] Luivatra#0000
I have no clue about eth, but I guess sending to a multi sig is cheaper than interacting with a bridge smart contract


[04/04/2023 8:45 AM] Luivatra#0000
but again, no clue

        @LuivatraEP is right. Interacting with a multisig wallet is requiring less gas fees rather than other smart contracts.
Also since rosen does not need any oracle or additional smart contract on eth side, probably it would be technically cheaper in most cases.

How do I add ErgoScript dependencies to an Eclipse Scala IDE?


[04/07/2023 10:04 AM] hq3r#0000
> (re @DanielTetsuyama : *How do I add ErgoScript dependencies to an Ecl...*)
         
        Chatgpt answer : 

To add ErgoScript dependencies to an Eclipse Scala IDE, you can follow the steps below:

Open your Eclipse Scala IDE.

Right-click on the project you want to add the ErgoScript dependency to.

Select "Build Path" from the context menu.

Click on "Configure Build Path" to open the Build Path settings.

Click on the "Libraries" tab.

Click on the "Add External JARs" button.

Browse to the location where you have downloaded the ErgoScript library (JAR file).

Select the ErgoScript JAR file and click "Open."

Click "OK" to close the Build Path settings.

The ErgoScript dependency should now be added to your project's build path in Eclipse Scala IDE. You can now use the ErgoScript library in your code.


[04/07/2023 10:04 AM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
Does it go in as a jar?


[04/07/2023 10:05 AM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
Thanks


[04/07/2023 10:05 AM] hq3r#0000
Wait for Someone to confirm :)


[04/07/2023 10:05 AM] hq3r#0000
Mostly it's correct


[04/07/2023 10:05 AM] DanielTetsuyama#0000
You have a link to the ErgoScript core? Or a built JAR?


[04/07/2023 10:06 AM] hq3r#0000
ErgoScript core library from its official GitHub repository at https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo.

To download the ErgoScript core library, navigate to the "ergo-script" folder in the repository and download the JAR file named "ergo-script.jar". You can then follow the steps I provided earlier to add the ErgoScript dependency to your Eclipse Scala IDE.


[04/07/2023 10:06 AM] Luivatra#0000

btw, it wont solve your sbt issues but you dont need to compile appkit from scratch, you can include it as a dependency in your build.sbt:
libraryDependencies += "org.ergoplatform" %% "ergo-appkit" % "5.0.1"

@Armeanio @CW @glasgowm If I was going to take on the initiative of creating a 10k collection on Ergo, and because I assume t1 cex funding isnt going to happen, is there a part of the ecosystem that would be extremely beneficial if it had more funding? Im going to get in touch with the Lilium guys and see if we could be the first 10k collection and all profits go to the EF.


[04/07/2023 7:02 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
We can link the EF treasury wallet or something for full transparency. I'd really like to go ahead with this and make something special happen.


[04/07/2023 7:04 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I dont have coding knowledge, but im good on the NFT side of things and have some social media presence. I think we can make something great happen. I'd like to be a part of pushing this ecosystem forward as much as I can.


[04/07/2023 7:05 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
However, I dont want to go to the community and just said "for the EF". Might be better if we have a target area where the funding could be put into.

        You could set up a multi sig with some other sigs and then vote what to spend it on. Not sure who needs it most but if you put out a call I'm sure you'd get some applicants


[04/07/2023 7:51 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Thats also a good idea.

Ergo is the only chain doing eUTXO as it should

Is there a JAR of the ErgoScript compiler?


[04/08/2023 6:06 AM] Rongrong21#0000
Hi guys, I have got an idea that why not explain about Ergo and its ecosystem projects using the terms that are often used on Ethereum. For example, what solution on Ergo is equivalent to Roll-up on Ethereum, ergoscript vs solidity. Since the exposure of Ethereum is dominating the industry, I think we should let the regular people know what Ethereum owns is also owned by Ergo and what Ergo owns is not owned by Ethereum. The conceptions of Ethereum and its ecosystem projects have gone into the crypto people or developers in the industry. They only are acquainted with the terms and conceptions from Ethereum and know a little about Ergo since Ergo has many different expressions.


[04/08/2023 9:16 AM] upwindstrategy#0000
How useful can chatGPT be to create Ergoscript code? Is it the same with Solidity?

Ergo's transaction validation protocol tries to be leanest government possible. Thus it does not care about tx fee, it does not even know about it. Tx fee is a result of agreements between nodes in the network & between miners and users

ErgoPad for example is listed there, but there is no price tracking as there is no support for Spectrum yet

        Alexis, I would focus more on spectrum development for now , after the tokens dashboard  I have reached the conclusion that we are missing so much metrics and development on spectrum end

I hope you have the patience of a thousand patient people


[04/10/2023 11:51 PM] hq3r#0000
If your value is comming from spectrum, would Invest more time in SPF and build stuff , then focus on listing

Very interesting tweet from Ales: 
https://twitter.com/berry_ales/status/1647569450940416000

I would be really interested to know what's Ergo's advantage in this field, specially in the light of the comment made by zygomeb saying that the Leios paper didn't address the problems of finality and reorg problems in case of conflicting transactions. Is PoW better suited for "horizontal scalability"? Maybe some smart minds could add some interesting things about Ergo in this thread.

I was reading the Ouroboros Leios paper. Something really sparked my interest and that is horizontal scalability. Basically the more resources you add to the system the more txs it can process.

@singh_annn An Xinxin. Very influential member of blockchain community in China. He was CEO of Jinse Caijing and built it to #1 crypto media company in China. Also he is a big Ergo believer and has contributed greatly already to ergo during past 2+ years. Actually probably i should have brought him into ergonauts before.

@Cococryptoer Coco is his assistant and is also very knowledgeable and big into crypto. She speaks fluent English and Russian in addition to Chinese. She is newer to ergo but am confident she will become a big ergonaut herselfüôÇ

Crypto/blockchain/web3 or whatever you want to call it I think is entering a new era in China. Last week we attended the web3 festival in HK with 10k plus ppl. It is set apart by the fact it was led by mainland chinese firms and most attendees mainland chinese. I expect very rapid development going forward with HK being the epicenter but can also expect a higher level of activity in mainland China. We will strive to work with An Xinxin to build Ergo market in China and ride the wave. üí™

Lithos will provide potential for tokens to have fair launch emissions so that could be something in future too

Transaction fees would be very high with mass adoption. Especially in 2045...


[04/20/2023 11:51 PM] Rongrong21#0000
You means each block contains tons of transactions, that is, the total fee of many transactions in one block is high enough to give miners a high block reward?

$1,000 erg is a $1 tx fee at current rates. Tx fee can be changed at any time with miner consensus to account for rising prices. Not a huge issue at all.

        Yes. That is what I would expect long term if mass adoption. Low fees per transaction but huge number of transactions so in aggregate a lot of compensation for miners.

So yeah, transaction fees (and MEV) , storage rent, and custom emission contracts rewarding miners with non-native tokens as part of FIMO (Fair Initial Mining Offering) etc. 
I guess there is no article covering all these methods combined?

I forwarded flipo tg to interested parties and also to flipo but since then I have no update.


[04/23/2023 9:09 AM] Rongrong21#0000
(re @seedubya : *@justin1000 can help Eva maybe with a Chinese ...*)
        
        It is unnecessary to do AMA in current Chinese community. The people who still stay in Chinese groups at this hard times are Ergo supporters who are waiting for Ergo to rise up. What is important is that we should attract newcomers to join Ergo Chinese community by taking new strategies, for example, publishing Chinese articles about ergo and its ecosystem to attract more Chinese people to support Ergo as Singh An suggested. Currently, we are trying to solve the problem of how to get a Chinese Wechat public account.


[04/23/2023 9:18 AM] Rongrong21#0000
I have an idea that we should prepare lists of FAQs about Ergo and its ecosystem projects so that people can understand them easily by reading these FAQs and publish the lists in the form of articles so that we don't have to answer questions repeatedly and we can enable newcomers to read FAQs to initially understand ergo and its ecosystem projects and in future AMAs we just need to answer new questions.


[04/23/2023 9:22 AM] Rongrong21#0000
A series of pictures introducing ergo and its ecosystem projects enable people to understand them easily. I think listing FAQs is also a good way to make regular people to understand ergo and its ecosystem projects.


[04/23/2023 9:23 AM] Rongrong21#0000

[04/23/2023 2:51 PM] Torto#0000
this idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãsimple FAQs can help to create another series of graphics and images, threads, little cuts 'easy to use and share' that can make us leave Ergobubble and reach others

That is true, unfortunately. Interest from miners can be expected when storage rent affect weight of their pockets heh


[04/25/2023 7:11 AM] upwindstrategy#0000
For FT it could be some sort of babel fees, but for NFTs that could be impossible. And the question is also would the miner get it or the mining pool?

Hi guys, is there an article that describes how to prevent rug-pull on ergo?

A Chinese community member reminded us of learning marketing experience from China Shandong Zibo, a small but the most popular tourism city in China due to its barbecue at present.

At rest time, I watched a lot of videos about zibo shaokao (barbecue) and found the truth why the city is so popular in China now. The truth is being honesty.

I think Ergo and its ecosystem projects here also feature this good quality, being honesty, no scams, no rug-pulls.

As we know, rug-pulls or scams often happened in the crypto space. Therefore, if there are some methods that prevent scams or rug-pulls, for example, refundable ico, code audit, locking the team's tokens using smart contracts or any other similar rug-pull resistance methods, I believe the crypto people will show more confidence in ergo and its ecosystem projects.


Most importantly, we should highlight this ability of rug-pull resistance by creating an article or picture that describes this ability.

        Thank you


[04/28/2023 1:28 AM] Rongrong21#0000
I have read these two articles. However, they just tell the people how to avoid scams. My point is that since there are some scam projects that pretend to be a true project by using such terms as fair launch, decentralized, open-source, transparent, high tps and other words that are often used by a true blockchain project. These scam projects are trying to make regular people confused when they meet so many blockchain projects because it is hard for the regular people to judge which one is really decentralized, fairly launched and open-source. 

In my opinion, it is necessary to explain to the public about the rug-pull or scam resistance mechanisms that are adopted by Ergo and its ecosystem projects, for example, refundable ico, locking the team's tokens with smart contracts for at least two years, providing code audit report.  These measures can set Ergo apart from other potential fake projects. That is, through understanding these anti-scam mechanisms, people can distinguish a true blockchain project from fake ones. People can find that Ergo is a gem.

If we do marketing for Ergo with the slogan of "rug-pull resistant public chain" and people can understand that Ergo can make it by these anti-scam mechanisms, this may attract much attention. Maybe, in the future, other blockchain projects may have to prove that they are true by providing anti-scam actions.

        You make a good point and that kind of message will attract a new subset of people.


[04/28/2023 1:40 AM] Rongrong21#0000
So, an explainer article about these anti-scam mechanisms is quite required.

(re @Rongrong21 : *So, an explainer article about these anti-scam...*)
        
        I just don't know if this is the appropriate name ‚Äòanti-scam' because ergo it's not anti-scam in fact since any individual can create a project enlist others in the community attract investment and engagement and disappear.  what makes ergo attractive against scam are the mechanisms of the projects, how they stand up for community audit and why the purposes and principles of the ergo can contribute to it going strong.

[04/28/2023 2:34 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Perhaps we need a different framework. The analogy that seems closest is "literacy". It's not just for words, but it is also used for numeracy, information, financial products, cryptocurrency projects, etc. There's a straight-line through these ideas about how to judge quality, a literacy in a domain if knowledge, that feels relevant here...

        you're right I would love to produce something graphic about this, both this anti-scam concept and something based on literacy has strength and importance.  I also think that telling the same things in different ways is always a great strategy, we are at least positioning ourselves.


[04/28/2023 3:02 AM] Rongrong21#0000
I will request the editorial team to write an article about the rug-pull resistance mechanisms adopted by Ergo and its ecosystem projects like Paideia so that you create a picture based on that.

I know three rug-pull resistance mechanisms by translating many English articles and tweets into Chinese. They are locking the team's tokens using smart contracts for a long period such as two years, refundable ICO and code audit. If there are more similar mechanisms, you guys here can share them with us.
