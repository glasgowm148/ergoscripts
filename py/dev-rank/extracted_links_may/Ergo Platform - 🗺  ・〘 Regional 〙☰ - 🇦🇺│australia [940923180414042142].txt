Hello!


[04/23/2022 1:04 AM] CW#8500
Hey mate, didnt know you were an Aussie!


[04/23/2022 3:00 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Seem to be a pretty rare breed here


[04/29/2022 10:23 AM] CW#8500
I'd say! I've got quite a few into Ergo IRL, not into socials though

Hey mate, welcome, one by one we are growing! lol

@CW what is the difference between ergo foundation? Ergo core and sigmanaughts?


[05/12/2022 7:08 PM] CW#8500
Ergo Foundation are board members of the not for profit

Ergo core are core members of Ergo Platform 

Sigmanauts are a cohort of community members offering their time, experience and services to the progression if Ergo. 

If the Sigmanaut program sounds interesting you can sign up

Anyone mining Erg in Australia?


[08/15/2022 1:19 PM] raidboss#6754
Yeah I mined ERG for about 4 months over last summer but then decided to Mine eth and convert straight to ERG.


[08/15/2022 1:20 PM] raidboss#6754
@CW Hello CW Love your Youtube channel! Is it possible if you make a guide on how to read and use the ERGO explorer effectively? Would be a great resource for the community. I kinda just work out when things are coming in and out of my address and don't fully understand all the other cryptographic information etc.

hey mate good idea! it can be a little tricky coming from an account based model. I'll add it to the list!


[08/16/2022 5:21 AM] CW#8500
yep sure am!


[08/16/2022 5:33 AM] Batman#7422
I did the math with the cost of electricity here and it hardly seemed worth it. My new place has a moderate solar system so I'll look into it again then.

[08/16/2022 6:29 AM] CW#8500
power prices here a pretty ridiculous. solar is the go. helps to significantly reduce the number. even if only mining throughout the day, there is no cost incurred for the most part. 

I have a 13.2kw system, its chews up a huge amount of my usage both directly and indirectly (selling to the grid) each year


[08/22/2022 12:00 PM] no1smove#0177
I didn't realise there was an Australia channel, just thought I'd pop in to say g'day!


[08/22/2022 12:04 PM] no1smove#0177
CW thanks heaps for all your content, I'm driving a lot for work so I just set it up, drive away and listen. Good to have the opportunity to learn and think about what's really important instead of my day job üòÇ

Cheers guys!


[08/25/2022 11:59 PM] CW#8500
Any of you going to the crypto convention on the Goldie? Might head up if i can find some time


[08/27/2022 11:57 PM] raidboss#6754
I am down in Melbourne. Would do it if I was in GC. Maybe Ergo needs a stand at one of these conventions one day.


[08/28/2022 11:36 AM] no1smove#0177
I'm in Perth so yeah nah too far. Funnily enough I was at that exact place a couple weeks ago repping a stand at another convention for work

{Reactions}
üî• 

[08/28/2022 11:44 AM] no1smove#0177
Couldn't agree more. A stand at this one starts at 2k AUD so it's the kind of thing that's possibly within the range of what an ergo raffle could muster even


[08/28/2022 11:55 AM] no1smove#0177
I'd man a stand for Ergo any day! Till then I'll keep dreaming one day they'll host a crypto convention in Perth ü•≤

[08/29/2022 12:42 AM] CW#8500
A stand is pretty cheap. I'm heading there, booked everything this morning. Not too sure on a stand, hard to tell the size of the convention regarding retail traffic. Ill be sure to make some noise there so poeple know about Ergo heh


[08/29/2022 12:43 AM] CW#8500
Have to organize an Aus Ergonaut meet up. @no1smove on the east coast anytime soon?


[08/29/2022 6:29 AM] no1smove#0177
Yeah I was talking generally, not this conference. If that stand fee is the going rate for crypto conventions it could be an option for the future.
Gotta know your audience and plan what you want to get out of a convention before taking the leap


[08/29/2022 6:38 AM] no1smove#0177
At this stage I'm in Melbs last week of Oct and Sydney early mid Jan. Whenever I'm East I'm working and the schedule is hard to predict, but if stars align I'd be keen for an Ergo meetup. Tricky one to organise with our geography!


[08/29/2022 6:39 AM] no1smove#0177
Where abouts are you CW?


[08/29/2022 6:48 AM] CW#8500
Im a bit rural but closest to Canberra


[08/29/2022 7:32 AM] no1smove#0177
Ah right yeah I don't think I'll ever find myself out that way! Damn big beautiful country

Clarifying crypto not taxed as foreign currency | Treasury.gov.au
On 22¬†June¬†2022, the Government announced it would introduce legislation to exclude crypto assets such as Bitcoin from being treated as a foreign currency for Australian income tax purposes. The proposed legislation maintains the current tax treatment of crypto assets and removes uncertainty following the decision of the Government of El Salvado...


[09/06/2022 12:48 PM] no1smove#0177
My interpretation is in some ways good - decentralised crypto should never be "foreign"
But in other ways it seems like it could have implications by excluding it from being classed as money, now and in the future.
Unfortunately I didn't major in law or accounting so I'm probably losing a lot in translation though

How was crypto con CW? Anyone else here go along?

G'day from a fellow Aussie enjoying a Friday public holiday üôÇ


[09/24/2022 10:02 PM] CW#8500
It was good in some respect, networking and spreading the Ergo word. 

On the hand it was just an EVM shill fest promising to solve all the worlds problems. Most of the educational seminars were people ultimately just shilling their products lol


[09/24/2022 10:02 PM] CW#8500
Hey mate!


[09/25/2022 2:57 AM] Sam2Can#6957
Just letting you know, I saw SoaT's video the other day and am doing my bit with a home miner contribution of 3.9gh (Solo, because why not, given the current state of things)


[09/25/2022 2:58 AM] Sam2Can#6957
Looking forward to the EIP getting up.


[09/25/2022 3:08 PM] CW#8500
cheers mate, nice size outfit. what are you running?


[10/08/2022 9:28 AM] Batman#7422
How's your mining rig going CW?


[10/09/2022 10:28 PM] CW#8500
Still churning away, yield dropped for obvious reasons. i have solar so that also helps


[10/21/2022 11:05 AM] CW#8500
Is anyone impacted by all this flooding?


[10/24/2022 11:38 PM] Batman#7422
The bridge I take to work got damaged


[10/24/2022 11:38 PM] Batman#7422
Worked out pretty well as I got to work from home for a few days


[11/22/2022 9:14 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Unlucky loss I suppose


[11/24/2022 11:21 AM] CW#8500
cant discredit having a crack for sure


[12/19/2022 10:30 PM] Zach | Picaro#5270
Can we bisq this group? Forget about capital gains altogether. That‚Äôd be swell. Free up a lot of AUD capital for the bigger life purchases.


[03/24/2023 11:59 AM] raidboss#6754
For all the Victorians the VIC gov is handing out money to help pay electricity bills. I missed the last one by 1 day which was yesterday. But you can sign up back to back takes 2 seconds and they deposit  $250 it into your bank acc.
I'm turning on my 1gh/sec miner cus it's starting to get cold down here. https://compare.energy.vic.gov.au/
