I’m currently working on a scala application that allows groups of people to send their mining pool rewards to a single smart contract which automatically distributes rewards back to the miners in a way that is proportional to their hashrate. 

The goal is to create subpools of low hashrate miners that can pool together their hashrates without a third party controlling the rewards.

Hello! I think this idea is really interesting! Let me know if you're looking for team members.


[10/07/2021 8:30 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Hey yeah id be interested in hearing your ideas and would love some help if you wanna join this team


[10/07/2021 8:32 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I’ll make a github repository tonight with a readme explaining the basic approaches we could take for solving this problem.


[10/07/2021 8:34 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Also thanks for inspiring to me make this project! My hope is that this can eventually serve as a first step to the smartpools you described.


[10/08/2021 3:34 AM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Thank @kushti and the rest of those involved in the Collateralized Smart Contract paper. 🙂

It’s possible, you can just use network tools to figure it out btw


[10/08/2021 10:17 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Alright, I'll try using the network tools to figure it out, if I need any help ill make sure to tag you


[10/08/2021 10:17 PM] ProSavage#7131
So what exactly are u doing in general?


[10/08/2021 10:17 PM] ProSavage#7131
I was going to do hackathon but forgot about my trip I’m on right now 😪


[10/08/2021 10:59 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
The goal is to allow groups of people to distribute mining rewards from a mining pool amongst themselves using smart contracts


[10/08/2021 11:00 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Essentially a pool in a pool, except this pool automatically distributes the rewards without a centralized authority


[10/08/2021 11:01 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I will likely have to hook into the different mining pool api's to achieve this but for right now I'm probably just going to focus on one pool


[10/08/2021 11:25 PM] ProSavage#7131
Lmk what I can do to help.


[10/08/2021 11:35 PM] ProSavage#7131
My girlfriend says that it is confusing people more. 
I explained the concept to her, and I do kind of see it. It’s more complex and will need to be explained really well.


[10/08/2021 11:36 PM] ProSavage#7131
I can probably build this software quickly - and I do see how it can be cool because you can do mini pools for ur friends and get paid quickly instead of every 4 days or something.


[10/08/2021 11:36 PM] ProSavage#7131
Shit. I could do this on my pool right now and just claim it’s a pool right


[10/08/2021 11:36 PM] ProSavage#7131
@WilfordGrimley this was your idea right?


[10/08/2021 11:45 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Yeah I'm hoping that this will allow more people to consider smaller pools by getting paid quicker, thereby increasing decentralization


[10/08/2021 11:46 PM] ProSavage#7131
So it would be like a pseudo way for pools to get paid


[10/08/2021 11:46 PM] ProSavage#7131
This can be almost predatory


[10/08/2021 11:47 PM] ProSavage#7131
I can see a way to utilize this


[10/08/2021 11:47 PM] ProSavage#7131
So what if I submit shares to other pools


[10/08/2021 11:47 PM] ProSavage#7131
But if the share diff is higher than network diff meaning it’s a block


[10/08/2021 11:47 PM] ProSavage#7131
I just submit the share for ourselves


[10/08/2021 11:47 PM] ProSavage#7131
Basically getting us more rewards


[10/08/2021 11:51 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Well in the end I'm relying on the api of whatever mining pool is being used to show accurate numbers for the shares being spent. Ideally the mining pools wouldn't have to change anything. A group of people can generate a Pay2Script address of the smart contract from the app, the pool then pays the rewards to that address as it would normally. Once the rewards are sent to the smart contract it will go through multiple stages before being distributed back to the miners who made the script using the dApp.


[10/08/2021 11:52 PM] ProSavage#7131
Hmm okay


[10/08/2021 11:52 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I definitely have to be careful in how this is done, because it could theoretically be easy to fake share numbers so that one miner could get more rewards than what he deserved.


[10/08/2021 11:52 PM] ProSavage#7131
So this isn’t like a mid level stratum


[10/08/2021 11:52 PM] ProSavage#7131
It’s a smart contract address?


[10/08/2021 11:53 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Yea it's really just a smart contract address that automatically distributes the rewards back.


[10/08/2021 11:54 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Pools shouldn't have to change anything ideally, the dapp will hook into the pools api and work from there.

[10/08/2021 11:55 PM] ProSavage#7131
I learned everything I know about crypto while building my pool


[10/08/2021 11:55 PM] ProSavage#7131
I only know what I needed to know to build pool lol


[10/08/2021 11:58 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Yeah no problem if there isn't much you can do on that side of things. I'm working on the smart contract stuff right now, once that's done ill work on the off chain code that hooks into mining pool api's. The off chain code is where I might dm you for some questions regarding enigma pool's api and stratum in general.

[10/09/2021 12:42 AM] WilfordGrimley#0124
@Cheese Enthusiast was inspired by my paper from the last Hackathon that was linked above. Subpooling is a requirement for SmartPools to work as suggested in the paper. 🙂


[10/09/2021 12:45 AM] WilfordGrimley#0124
@Cheese Enthusiast will collateral be required by your design?

What is to ensure the accuracy of the hashrates reported by miners?

{Reactions}
ergo_white 

[10/09/2021 1:09 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
There are a few different ways to go about ensuring hashrate accuracy. For the basic model that I'm creating, each miner will independently sign an output transaction that includes a collection in R4. This collection will map each miner's public key to the share numbers that were retrieved from the mining pool. These output transactions will go to another smart contract that then tries to make a consensus about the number of shares that each miner submitted.


[10/09/2021 1:09 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
The current(and simplest) strategy that I'm working on will simply take the average of each miner's collection and consider that as the consensus. Although this strategy isn't ideal, I want to focus on hashing out the logic of everything and making a product that works for right now. There are a number of different strategies that could be used to find a consensus so I'm confident that I could slowly add them in over time.


[10/09/2021 1:14 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Collateral shouldn't have to be required by this design, and I've also avoided using oracles because I dont think I'm advanced enough to incorporate them yet. As I learn more I'll try to incorporate these things as they should make the consensus more accurate and easier to handle.

The smart contracts certainly worked on the testnet but I have yet to see if the actual program works on the mainnet with real miners mining to a pool.


[10/13/2021 10:52 AM] gilgaMesh#8262
this concept looks interesting, I would like to read a detailed description!(github description was not enough xD)


[10/13/2021 4:46 PM] glasgowm#9381
shared in the mining chats


[10/13/2021 5:24 PM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
@Cheese Enthusiast just DM you lets talk


[10/13/2021 10:05 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Thanks, I appreciate it!


[10/13/2021 10:11 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
@gilgaMesh I'll paste the instructions that I sent @ÅrÖhBê here. Ill put up a more detailed description on github tonight but essentially all this program does is create an ergo address that multiple people can mine to. A group of friends can all mine to some mining pool(For right now either enigma pool or herominers) and then put this same address in their mining programs.


[10/13/2021 10:13 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Once a payout is sent to this address, each friend can send a withdraw request using the program. When everyone has sent a withdraw request, anybody from the friend group can type the distribute command and all of the payout money will automatically be distributed to each miner. The money will be paid according to the proportion of shares each miner sent to the mining pool.


[10/13/2021 10:21 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
For example, lets say Alice and Bob are mining to Herominers and decide to make a subpool. They go through the program instructions and then mine to the subpool for a few days until they get their payout of 0.5 ERG. Alice decides to send a withdraw request first, she enters the withdraw command which pings Herominers for information about the subpool. Herominers then sends the information back to Alice's subpooling program. The information consists of 3 things: Alice's Share #, Bob's Share #, and the total Share #. Lets say during Alice's withdraw request, the information she got was ```[50, 25, 75]```


[10/13/2021 10:25 PM] sankRian#7431
Great job 👌 bro, and I have questions, according what you say  anyone can submit the wd request, so if there is some member of the subpool didn't reach min. Ammounnt of tx fee cuz of he just start to mine is his reward getting through the transaction or still stuck in the subpool address?? Or one of the sub member don't want to wd yet til certain amount that he wish.. can this smart contract did that?😁👍


[10/13/2021 10:31 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
A day later Bob sends his withdraw request, which has this information from the mining pool: 
```[100, 50, 150]```
Now that both Bob and Alice have sent withdraw requests, either Bob or Alice can enter the distribute command. Bob sends this command to the smart contract which takes the average from both withdraw requests and comes to a consensus about how many shares Alice or Bob sent. In this case the consensus will look like this:
```[75, 37.5, 112.5]```
Alice will get ```(75 / 112.5) * (0.5 - (MinTxFee / 2)) = ~0.32``` while Bob will get  ```(37.5 / 112.5) * (0.5 - (MinTxFee / 2)) = ~0.16```


[10/13/2021 10:40 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
So in your case, first everyone would submit the withdraw request. And then some person would enter the distribute command to distribute the money. If some member of the pool got an extremely low amount of money, they should still get that money sent to them because the transaction fee is split up amongst every member of the subpool. In the example I put above, Bob and Alice each paid half of the transaction fee during the distribution phase.

For your second question, the amount of money to withdraw is essentially determined by your mining pool's payout. for example in HeroMiner's it is 0.5. If you manually changed your pool's payout to 1.0 and ensured that 1.0 is inputted when you create the subpool, then the subpool should still work the same way.


[10/13/2021 10:50 PM] sankRian#7431
Thanks, I will give it try soon.. 😁👍


[10/13/2021 10:57 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548

[10/14/2021 4:28 PM] mhs_sam#1471
hey,
what's the purpose of 'wallet' field in the subpool_config.json file? there is no info in the readme.

to whom it belongs? 
and why it is required?


[10/14/2021 4:36 PM] mhs_sam#1471
- would you please briefly describe what is the economical reason to subpooling? who will benefit from joining a subpool rather than joining the pool itself, and who will be in loss?
- what are the other (non-economical) reasons?
 - is it a fair distribution mechanism? It looks that in this system all the shares are considered to be equal, but in most cases it is not true.


[10/14/2021 4:52 PM] sankRian#7431
1) i think for 24/7 miner who has big hashrate didn't get more advantage using this, but for smaller miner and didn't do it for 24/7 it will help them to get pay out more faster rather than waiting the pool min. Pay out,. And also for me as 24/7 miner I can use it for distributing my reward directly to my main wallet and CEX wallet for selling and cover the cost without send it manually and cost me the tx fee again also waiting confirmation from the cex
2. This is early stage maybe in the next stage it become smartpooling so anyone can make their own node and make hashrate distribution more desentrelise rather than relaying on conventional pool
3) Idk maybe the dev will explain

😁👍


[10/14/2021 4:53 PM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
@mhs_sam we have a small subpool formed and being tested.  DM me or Rian if you have interest


[10/14/2021 11:45 PM] root7Z#8699
why dm just @Cheese Enthusiast


[10/14/2021 11:47 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Hey @mhs_sam and @root7Z, apologies I didnt explain the wallet field too well on the github.


[10/14/2021 11:48 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
The wallet field is to help verify that an address pertaining to a miner is actually inside the subpooling smart contract. Essentially it allows members of a subpool to sign withdraw requests and distribution transactions.


[10/14/2021 11:49 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
As far as I can tell, to verify that an address is yours, you need the secret key corresponding to that address to prove your ownership, thats all the wallet field is being used for


[10/15/2021 12:01 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
The reason for joining subpooling is to get rewards faster than mining alone. This is especially true for smaller miners or miners that are currently mining to small mining pools(so not nanopool). In many ways, time is money. Having access to funds quickers may increase the value of those funds simply because you can do more with money that isnt locked away.


[10/15/2021 12:05 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I feel that subpooling adds a very social aspect to mining that can help encourage more people to mine. My own group of friends all made a discord channel for subpooling so that we could look our pc's mine and analyze how much money we're getting back. A few of the people here who have been helping me test like @sankRian and @ÅrÖhBê also made their own telegram group to look at their subpool. I think this is a great way to get miners, both new and old, into the system.


[10/15/2021 12:06 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I also feel like Ergo and subpooling can work specifically well together, given that the AutoLykos algorithm is ASIC resistant. By combining subpooling with the fact that normal gpus can be used for mining Ergo, you allow for smaller miners to really see results while mining, even if the pool they're mining to is small.


[10/15/2021 12:11 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I think it is fair to analyze who will be at a loss, and I suppose in that case it will be smaller miners who stay out of subpools. I think it is unlikely that large and small miners join in a subpool together because the different proportion of shares will be offputting for smaller miners. I can see larger miners joining together in subpools, but I am not sure how much of an effect this has on the mining ecosystem. These larger miners were mining anyway, I do not think that their money going through a smart contract to be distributed will have a large effect on them mining or not as they can always get lots of money quickly. The biggest effect I see is smaller miners joining together because they benefit the most from quick rewards. I also think small mining pools will see a boost in usage since people will be able to get rewards quicker from them.


[10/15/2021 12:12 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
In terms of the distribution mechanism, this is actually the part that I find most interesting because there are actually a huge number ways to go about distributing the money.


[10/15/2021 12:13 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Currently the distribution works by taking the proportion of *valid* shares submitted a miner to the number of total *valid* shares that all subpool miners submitted.


[10/15/2021 12:14 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I think taking valid shares only is the best way to make sure that the shares being submitted actually matter.


[10/15/2021 12:17 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
There is the problem of PPLNS, where technically only the most recent shares matter. This definitely makes things harder in some ways. I've been thinking about how to go about solving PPLNS schemes for subpooling, but I'm not sure where I can get the information from the pool about which N number of shares actually contributed to the payout.


[10/15/2021 12:23 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Regardless, subpooling is intended for groups of people who trust each other. The potential for abuse by some people does exist, but that abuse cannot be hidden. Any member of the subpool can go on their mining website and see who has been contributing. In addition, all transactions on the blockchain are public. Therefore any member can see how much money everyone else got and can correspond that to the share number's they submitted. I have also given the equation used to calculate box values on the github so if someone is trying to fake it through the system they will likely be caught pretty quick. At that point, all someone has to do is kick that member and create a new subpool.


[10/15/2021 12:24 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Anyways, the current holding and distribution method will not be the only one. I have plans for more smart contract options, some that require more trust, and some that require less.


[10/15/2021 12:26 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I hope that explains all of your points @root7Z and @mhs_sam, Sorry that I ended up writing an essay! 😅

[10/15/2021 7:52 PM] gilgaMesh#8262
its great for a group of miners who are friends, instead of having to wait for 2-3 days for getting payouts if mining individually they can mine together yet remain separate and help each other get rewards faster without having to switch to solo mining or using one wallet address for combining the hashrates together.

@Cheese Enthusiast Ive been banned from talking from your server so I gotta ask here

Do people submit shares to a smart contract too?

[12/05/2021 2:35 AM] ProSavage#7131
ya from what I see it just says payouts


[12/05/2021 2:35 AM] ProSavage#7131
so we still need to trust you for counting shares and then reporting that to the smart contract


[12/05/2021 2:35 AM] ProSavage#7131
so you can still lie to the users about share counts


[12/05/2021 2:36 AM] ProSavage#7131
So you might as well just run a normal pool no?


[12/05/2021 2:36 AM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
The SmartPooling Contracts allow for an open and honest payment distribution system. Each payment will have information about who received the payments, what numbers(in this case share numbers)


[12/05/2021 2:36 AM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
Please read


[12/05/2021 2:36 AM] ProSavage#7131
yeah but we submit shares to a smart contract?


[12/05/2021 2:36 AM] ProSavage#7131
does my miner submit share counts to a database and then you report it to the smart contract?


[12/05/2021 2:36 AM] ProSavage#7131
if so


[12/05/2021 2:36 AM] ProSavage#7131
you are the medium reporting for me


[12/05/2021 2:36 AM] ProSavage#7131
and its not completely trustless


[12/05/2021 2:38 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
So currently, share verification is the harder part of making a smart pool. If we're following WilfordGrimley's model, we will need oracle pools that miner's submit their share numbers too.


[12/05/2021 2:38 AM] ProSavage#7131
yeah I really dont see how this is really possible since it would be so high demand right?


[12/05/2021 2:38 AM] ProSavage#7131
I mean Im sure its possible to do


[12/05/2021 2:39 AM] ProSavage#7131
and its an interesting problem


[12/05/2021 2:39 AM] ProSavage#7131
but it needs to be accepted ASAP since the whole concept of stales etc


[12/05/2021 2:39 AM] ProSavage#7131
like your stratum itself just broadcasts me  job


[12/05/2021 2:39 AM] ProSavage#7131
and then the verification is some smart contract executed


[12/05/2021 2:39 AM] ProSavage#7131
and then stored on chain


[12/05/2021 2:40 AM] ProSavage#7131
and then the data is pulled from chain on payment and then paid according to chain data


[12/05/2021 2:41 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Yeah it's complicated to implement right now. I want to wait for oracles v2 to be released before dipping my toes into that side of the smart pool. Until then I'm focusing on making a smart contract that is modular enough that it can eventually take that data from the oracle and use it to distribute accordingly.


[12/05/2021 2:41 AM] ProSavage#7131
okay so cool, just payments for now, and the stratum is pretty much normal.


[12/05/2021 2:42 AM] ProSavage#7131
Now, why is it called 'subpool'


[12/05/2021 2:42 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Right now we're focused on making the payment side of things completely transparent and verifiable. You will be paid an exact value according to the shares submitted.


[12/05/2021 2:42 AM] ProSavage#7131
can I eventually use multiple pools ?


[12/05/2021 2:42 AM] ProSavage#7131
because I can see like a pool supporting and directly paying using some smart contract to the pool which is picked up by the subpool software's contract and paid to the user


[12/05/2021 2:42 AM] ProSavage#7131
and the trustless part is achieved for the *subpool*


[12/05/2021 2:45 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
With the way I'm currently building these SmartPool contracts, they will allow SmartPools to have their own subpools of miners. This means that we can have multiple users decided on how they are paid. The only payment that the smart pool decides is the initial payment to the subpool itself(Like it would for any member of the SmartPool). Once the ERG has been paid to the Subpool, they may vote and decide how many shares each member of the subpool gets.


[12/05/2021 2:48 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
So yeah the subpooling aspect would currently be more trustless, but I would say that moving to the SmartPool in general will mean that cheating in terms of payments and share verification is much harder. This in combination with the fact that the smart pool will auto-fork once it reaches a certain hashrate means that it should be pretty safe and decentralized.


[12/05/2021 2:51 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I'm certainly not claiming that we're 100% decentralized just yet, but I also think that achieving that goal is going to take a lot of work. In the meantime I am happy with how the smart contracts are looking and working, and I am confident that by making things in this way we can eventually achieve full decentralization. Until then, I think most people will be happy with a half way compromise that makes cheating very hard, but keeps share verification as a stratum job.


[12/05/2021 4:36 AM] danandbeard#2312
read this paper if you want to see how you could feasibly handle shares on-chain so that the pool is actually trustless (i.e. people could mine to literally any node, including their own) https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity17/sec17-luu.pdf


[12/06/2021 3:38 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Interesting. Where is this implementation on ETH now, if it’s so feasible?


[12/06/2021 12:28 PM] danandbeard#2312
IIRC they mention in the paper that it was an academic exercise, but they got it working and successfully mined multiple blocks before shutting it down as they were not interested in maintaining it.


[12/06/2021 1:09 PM] glasgowm#9381

[12/06/2021 1:38 PM] danandbeard#2312
that seems like a different layer of functionality than smartpooling, no?


[12/06/2021 1:38 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Curious about why did it end at the academic phase, and not in production yet.


[12/06/2021 1:38 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Wonder if they ran into some economics or scalability challenges to do it large scale. The paper mentions some challenges in handling the transaction volumes


[12/06/2021 1:39 PM] danandbeard#2312
it _was_ in production, they didn't want to maintain it. I can't speak to their motives as I don't know the authors, but I suspect they're more interested in academia than maintaining projects


[12/06/2021 1:40 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
No what they described was a prototype to validate their research, that's far from being production.


[12/06/2021 1:41 PM] danandbeard#2312
there are some interesting problems to solve on ergo, but I think they can be solved.  I imagine a centralized service that would put a contract on-chain for each miner (where they could set their own share difficulty) - that contract would reward them with tokens.  Those tokens could then be used to claim rewards from the "main" contract where all participating miners send mining rewards


[12/06/2021 1:42 PM] danandbeard#2312
from the paper

>Results. We have implemented SMARTPOOL and a sta-
ble SMARTPOOL implementation has been released and
deployed on the main network via a crowd-funded com-
munity project [12]. As of 18 June 2017, SMARTPOOL-
based pools have mined in total 105 blocks on both
Ethereum and Ethereum Classic networks and have suc-
cessfully handled a peak hashrate of 30 GHs from 2 sub-
stantial miners.


[12/06/2021 1:42 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
30 GHs from 2 miners is not production.  Production is multi-region, globally deployed architecture


[12/06/2021 1:43 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
You run into all kinds of other challenges when going global unfortunately


[12/06/2021 1:43 PM] danandbeard#2312
ETHs blockchain is global, so this meets even your strange definition of production


[12/06/2021 1:44 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Miners have to mine to stratum, correct? Miners are global, not single location based


[12/06/2021 1:44 PM] danandbeard#2312
no


[12/06/2021 1:44 PM] danandbeard#2312
you should read the paper, they discuss all of this


[12/06/2021 1:45 PM] danandbeard#2312
tl;dr; individual miners build data structures that represent their shares - they submit them directly to the smart contract, which is globally accessible


[12/06/2021 1:47 PM] danandbeard#2312
don't get me wrong - there are definitely some challenges with moving that work onto ergo, but I think those problems are solvable


[12/06/2021 1:47 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Here's the challenge that I think you guys are missing, and why the project never went large scale.  Enabling this type of capability large scale, stable, and functional, takes effort and dollars to support.  When you are fully decentralized, who do you go to for help when things dont work?  Miners are not always able to solve their own problems, therefore they rely on the pool operator to do that for them.  Decentralization is great until you are left isolated from being able to get answers as to why you are not getting paid, when things dont go well. I suspect those challenges will be addressed as we progress to determine how far decentralized can we go before we are disconnected from being able to provide a consistent and stable product.


[12/06/2021 1:48 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
I think those are theories on how it will really work in real life, which is part of our journey and what we are trying to achieve


[12/06/2021 1:49 PM] danandbeard#2312
so you want to make something purposefully not decentralized, then?


[12/06/2021 1:49 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
No, that's not what I am saying


[12/06/2021 1:49 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
I think that to make this successful, there has to be a community of support


[12/06/2021 1:49 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
So that any miner can take advantage of the capabilities in a manner that is safe and transparent


[12/06/2021 1:49 PM] glasgowm#9381
yep sorry didnt notice the diff on my first pass. Interesting tho


[12/06/2021 1:50 PM] danandbeard#2312
very interesting, especially once DEX is full swing on ergo


[12/06/2021 1:50 PM] danandbeard#2312
MEV is an incredibly interesting subject


[12/06/2021 1:51 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Our #1 goal is to provide a User Experience and transparency that miners can take advantage of smart contracts-based mining. I think you can agree that such goal cannot be achieved if we are not able to manage and control the user experience. Otherwise how can we help?


[12/06/2021 1:51 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
How far do we go with decentralization I think is to be determined. We may choose to stop shy of a certain goal, or go past it. That's tbd


[12/06/2021 1:52 PM] danandbeard#2312
>  I think you can agree that such goal cannot be achieved if we are not able to manage and control the user experience.
who are "we"? I think _any_ kind of smart contract based mining will have community support, which means support from people who will get literally zero financial reward.  This kind of support exists heavily in this discord channel already


[12/06/2021 1:52 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
I think your thinking like that is why such capability has never been implemented.


[12/06/2021 1:53 PM] danandbeard#2312
yep, decentralization is all about tradeoffs, if the smartpool paper isn't what you want, I can understand the decision - either way it's a very interesting paper


[12/06/2021 1:54 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
User experience IMO is everything.  Depending on a discord channel for help when things dont go wrong is not for everyone


[12/06/2021 1:54 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
its #1 adoption issue with Ergo, and many other coins in my humble opinion.


[12/06/2021 1:54 PM] danandbeard#2312
more than happy to agree that we disagree here.  Something not existing doesn't mean the incentive wasn't there, things can not exist for many reasons outside of not having sufficient incentives


[12/06/2021 1:55 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Correct.


[12/06/2021 1:55 PM] danandbeard#2312
maybe I'll implement it myself sometime - certainly not a trivial project or I probably already would have


[12/06/2021 1:56 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
I don't have control outside of the parameters I am able to address with our team.  We have a mission and we are sticking to that.  May not be for everyone, but so far it is pretty exciting and a lot of interest from the community.  And like you said and I said before, if it was easy it would have been done by now.


[12/06/2021 1:57 PM] danandbeard#2312
indeed, well best of luck - I'd also talk to whoever on your team is claiming y'all have removed the 51% attack risks.  I'd be happy to discuss why that isn't possible to remove if we disagree on that point


[12/06/2021 1:58 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Yeah that is a whole conversation on it's own with it's own challenges.  Just throwing miners to an unrelated and unqualified pool is not the answer here.


[12/06/2021 1:58 PM] danandbeard#2312
even redirecting shares would not solve that problem - no matter which pool you redirected them too...if anything that would _increase_ the risk


[12/06/2021 1:59 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
It may not be a problem that can be addressed at all after all


[12/06/2021 1:59 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
but we are open to suggestions, its a commitment we have and we will address it


[12/06/2021 1:59 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
But there has to be bumper guards


[12/06/2021 2:00 PM] danandbeard#2312
imagine the scenario where someone hacks your stratum servers, which themselves are just redirecting shares...the community would see the biggest pool has 30% of the shares, when in reality maybe 75% of shares are going through servers y'all control....the hacker would then control 75% of the shares and it would be a lot harder to detect


[12/06/2021 2:01 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I have been thinking that looking at it through the lens of disincentivizing might be better. Might be better to make it less profitable for miners somehow if the hashrate reaches too high. Not a sure thing yet though, its a tough problem to solve.


[12/06/2021 2:02 PM] danandbeard#2312
I believe in order to solve the 51% problem in a similar way to what someone on your team was claiming - you'd have to rewrite miners such that pool(s) could submit data to the miners about what % of mining any pool controls...then miner clients could independently make decisions about which pool they would mine to

that's just one approach out of a few I could think of - more interesting to me would be the smartpool paper, which would solve the problem (imho) more directly


[12/06/2021 2:03 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
The challenges are multi facented:  miner incentive, pool operator incentive, and blockchain incentive.


[12/06/2021 2:03 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
they will have to be balanced, otherwise no miners, no network. no pool operators, no miners. without those two, no blockchain


[12/06/2021 2:04 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
and yes goes back to the paper's suggestion of removing pool operators from equation, which goes back to our previous discussion and those challenges.


[12/06/2021 2:08 PM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
To be clear @danandbeard instead of firing shots at our marketing.  I don’t think there is anything wrong with our statement that we are devoted to decentralization and committing to a pool fork.  How we do it.  Still to come.    Just wish people were a little more supportive instead of firing shots.


[12/06/2021 2:08 PM] danandbeard#2312
I'm more than happy to fire shots at any for-profit organization making false claims.  Ideally I'd fire shots directly at you on your own channels so the general public isn't involved, but I got banned from your channels. It's not okay to make false decentralization claims.


[12/06/2021 2:09 PM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
You guys came in with a fud attack and you know it.  I’m in enigmas room.


[12/06/2021 2:09 PM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
That’s why I banned you


[12/06/2021 2:09 PM] danandbeard#2312
I'm sure the claims were made with good intentions, but they were and are still false claims.


[12/06/2021 2:10 PM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
There is no false claim.


[12/06/2021 2:10 PM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
And by the way no profit has been made


[12/06/2021 2:10 PM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
We actually lost 100 erg supporting the pool


[12/06/2021 2:10 PM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
Of our own erg


[12/06/2021 2:10 PM] danandbeard#2312
okay, explain how y'all have solved 51% attack risk then.


[12/06/2021 2:10 PM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
Did we say we solved it.  And if it’s not done yet why would we share our plans with you


[12/06/2021 2:11 PM] danandbeard#2312
yes you literally said that


[12/06/2021 2:11 PM] danandbeard#2312
you specifically said that on reddit


[12/06/2021 2:11 PM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
- 51% Attack Prevention

SmartPool is devoted to pure decentralization by committing to pool forking if pool hash exceeds 40% of the total network hash.


[12/06/2021 2:11 PM] danandbeard#2312
okay so pool forking does not solve the 51% attack


[12/06/2021 2:11 PM] danandbeard#2312
as I explained above - if anything it makes the threat worse


[12/06/2021 2:12 PM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
Dude. Go find something to do lol


[12/06/2021 2:12 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
@danandbeard  this is why no one with any capital or resources wants to solve this problem. Because people like you are being short sighted.  You do realize that running a global mining pool with low latency and fantastic quality of service costs money. Lots of money.


[12/06/2021 2:12 PM] danandbeard#2312

you're more than welcome to tell people whatever you want, just know I'll be more than happy to call you out anytime you mislead people about 51% attack prevention

to quote you from https://www.reddit.com/r/erg_miners/comments/qnpvfh/new_ergo_pool_getblokio_smartpool/

> >> The differences are profound: 1) our code design is based on automatic forking if we ever get to a 51% network hashrate size - eliminating the risk of a 51% attack.

is wrong. You presumably were just mistaken when you said it back then, but if you continue saying it going forward after I explained why this is wrong then I'll have to assume you're willingly misleading people


[12/06/2021 2:21 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
misleading would be to tell people a lie when they ask about such feature. Any and everyone who has asked about our capabilities we have been 100% truthful about what we do today, and what we are doing in the future.  You are beating a dead horse, most likely for some alternate reason besides making the internet whole.


[12/06/2021 2:22 PM] danandbeard#2312
can you point to any publisized text correcting your mistake that continues to go unedited on reddit?


[12/06/2021 2:22 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273

You’re not banned on Our discord.  Feel free to go through all the chat.

[12/06/2021 2:38 PM] danandbeard#2312
well a quick skim thru your discord for "51" shows that apparently someone else was telling y'all the same thing - that you aren't preventing 51% attack and then y'all just continue to defend your position even with multiple people telling you that you're wrong


[12/06/2021 2:44 PM] danandbeard#2312
and for the record, I don't hate you - I don't even care about you or your pool.  I care about ergo and this whole thing started when someone came to enigmapool discord asking about the pool and saying "oh I thought getblok was already entirely using smart contracts" - which upon investigation y'all were claiming to be a smartpool (at the time) on your website

then upon further investigation you're claiming to have solve the 51% attack problem..needless to say after seeing multiple questionable marketing pieces from y'all's team I started caring that ergo had deceitful people coming in.

After talking with you I'm now starting to form the opinion that you're not trying to mislead people, you were just making mistakes, but instead of correcting those mistakes you see yourselves as victims of an attack - which I get it...it's hard to not feel attacked on the internet...either way I have no hard feelings or otherwise towards you or your pool. I'll continue to be protective of ergo, though


[12/06/2021 2:56 PM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
@danandbeard for now let’s just agree to disagree.  We too love ergo and if you knew anything about me you would see that I am not only a huge supporter of Ergo.  I have also made several contributions to the community.   Whether it is a mining guide, multiple room bots, and ongoing support to other community members.   We are here to stay and will solve many use cases including this one.   Appreciate you protecting ergo and we will continue to do the same.  Let’s put it this way.  If we fail (and we won’t) we will own that we made a mistake.   Until then it’s all progress.


[12/06/2021 2:59 PM] danandbeard#2312
for sure there are plenty of points I'm more than happy to "agree to disagree" on - there are other points like the 51% attack prevention that I believe I can prove categorically you cannot solve from the server side.

Either way, I don't believe y'all are trying to be malicious which was my main concern. I hope you'll reconsider your marketing or at least have more in-depth conversations with the community before making risk-prevention claims, but I also understand that decentralization is extremely hard and much easier to mess up than get right, so again - I'm not operating in bad-faith and trying to claim malice from y'all


[12/06/2021 3:00 PM] danandbeard#2312
I do think that y'all's focus on utilizing smart contracts and learning how you can use those to benefit mining decentralization is a worthy direction though - so I do wish y'all the best with making improvements on that front


[12/06/2021 3:20 PM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
Thank you.  There are many use cases we feel we can solve with the use of smart contracts.  Right now the focus is basic functionality and ease of use.   For example Subpooling is a thing already as you know, but not necessarily the easiest thing to use for the average end user.   Phase one was getting a standard pool up and running which has been completed.  Next phase is smart contract integration.  We will most likely spend a lot of time in this area before even scratch the surface on centralized hashrate control.   I think we have some time anyways lol.  Nano going to take a while to chip away at.

Why not trundle down the layers a bit to IPs and connections and just setup some load balancer that feeds off API info of hash on pool and then redirects to pool from its algo? Whether it be pools you have in different zones or third party ones. As long as the API feed in from say mining pool stats or something is fed into the algo then it would stop people all heading to one pool?


[12/14/2021 1:47 PM] danandbeard#2312
Well, that's not solving anything from the pool.  A mining client could implement something like that, but doing that from the pool is just trusting the pool, which if the pool is trustworthy then why would you redirect solutions to another pool which may not be trustworthy? Granted if you're dynamically redirecting to pools such that you don't send to any pools with high % of hashrate, the redirection to an untrustworthy pool isn't much of a concern, but it does create another concern. How much hashrate is being funneled thru a proxy a single pool controls?  If a single pool control a proxy which controls the direction of 51% of the hash, then it's even worse because no one in the community would notice and if someone were to hack that proxy they would immediately have access to a 51% attack


[12/14/2021 1:54 PM] danandbeard#2312
wouldn't even have to be a physical proxy either, if hash flow is being determined by a pool, lets say via a client API that accepts data from a single pool and that single pool tells the client where to mine...then if you control that single pool API and 51% of hashrate is being directed by that API, well that API can lie any time it wants to execute a 51% attack


[12/14/2021 7:26 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Great thoughts.  The 51% dilemma is not easy to solve. We are investing in Smart Contracts-based approach to address *some* of the transparency issues when dealing with solving this challenge.  It will be an evolution, not an event, and require lots of input from community to get it right.  I think to even achieve a goal of "mutual trust" between pools that want to participate in this "anti-51%" effort, some standardization of api, metrics, and information needs to be defined as a barrier for non-trustworthy/non-performing sources from joining this concept.    Just food for thought.


[12/14/2021 9:10 PM] andee#4722
I like P2Pool for Monero, if that could work together with non-outsourceability that would be great

I dont know enough to know if its feasible, my gut tells me that merge mining on a sidechain wouldn't work. But I dont really dont have a clue, I really like how it works though. Solo mining to your own node and sharing profits without any trust, no central point of failure / potential for bad behavior


[12/15/2021 7:31 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Yes agreed. Problem is for low hash rate miners. This is where smart contract based subpooling will solve that


[12/15/2021 7:56 PM] andee#4722
P2Pool works great for small miners, everyone is solo mining but sharing profits using PPLNS

[12/20/2021 12:47 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Would this smart contract approach not put extra pressure on the network. Almost making it do extra work just for the mining hash rate funnelling? I’m just thinking aloud.

What is Getblok's fee?


[12/21/2021 12:37 PM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
0% through year end.  Normally 1%


[12/22/2021 4:53 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Phase 1 still leverages stratum and node  architecture to handle shares.  The block rewards and payouts are held on chain and defined in smart contracts, therefore removing pool operator from holding the reward.  Phase 2 and follow on will explore transitioning Marie functions to the blockchain.


[12/22/2021 4:54 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Honestly the node and stratum architecture provides a purpose for the ecosystem, it is easy to dismiss it in the name of decentralization but not sure it’s the right path.  We’ll be sure to have those conversations at the right time.


[12/23/2021 1:48 PM] andee#4722
How will GetBlok be voting about the emission?


[12/23/2021 5:37 PM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
We plan to conduct initial votes on how the pool would like to vote (ie Majority rules or other) Then from there we will host a poll on the decision.  Working through details as we speak.

There are several benefits some are currently available and others are being worked on

Current Benefits:
-On-chain payment processing which provides additional transparency
-PoV (Proof-Of-Vote) token distribution of GBGT tokens 
-Decentralized community pool built by Ergo Miners and Developers

Future Benefits
-Subpooling  - Contribute hashrate in a solo effort with your friends
-PoW based token distribution other than GBGT

51% was the threshold selected for the pool to vote yes or no on the soft fork.

Wasnt it 90% Super majority? Was the term I heard in the proposal

That's awesome tho I'm glad it was approved


[02/21/2022 2:38 PM] Chrostpher#8935
Super majority is required for the actual soft fork vote. This was to decide which way the pool is voting. I believe soft fork voting begins March 5th. Last I heard all pools are in support so it’ll likely pass.


[02/21/2022 2:39 PM] Salu#0001

[02/21/2022 7:49 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
The proof-of-vote contract which gives the mechanism to show that the pool voted properly isnt out on mainnet yet. That will be up on the blockchain when real node-based voting starts for the soft fork (not indicative voting like right now)


[02/23/2022 6:54 PM] SoCool#6419
Anyone else see the math for hashrate on the website pretty far different from what nbminer is declaring? My nbminer is solidly reporting ~10-26 on my old 1050 (surprised it pops so much out!) and on my 3070 LHR I have a stable consistent 145

I should see 155-170 for my address if nbminer is correct (perhaps it's not?)

However the getblok UI always reports me around ~200-225

I presume nbminer is more accurate? Regardless, I just enjoy looking at the UI and feeling like I'm spitting our more hashes than I would expect 😄


[03/09/2022 5:15 PM] stateanomaly#4764
Haven't gotten a payment in 24 hours. Is this related to the soft fork?

I'd like to make a suggestion to the website's UI: all the plots do not show relevant information by restricting themselves to just the last 24h. They all should be in a range of at least a week.


[03/28/2022 11:17 AM] SoCool#6419
I second this, I do look occasionally at the charts and then realize they're not covering a sample period with meaningful enough volatility to be informative


[03/28/2022 7:14 PM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
Hey guys.  Thanks for the feedback.  Charts in our new V2 that we are working on are going to be much better with selectable time frames.

***ATTENTION*** MINERS:  We completed the first phase of our migration to Subpooling. There are *KNOWN ISSUES* - if you encounter these, try these work arounds:

1) "I CANT CONNECT" - make sure you are using ergo.getblok.io as your stratum address.  While other regional addresses *may work*, we cannot confirm until we are complete with our migration.
2) "MY MINER SHOWS FAILED TO PARSE RPC ERROR" - there is a known issue with Team Red Miner and our stratum code. Work around currently is to use NBMiner or any other miner.  We are continuing to investigate.
3) "BLOCKS SHOW ORPHANED" - this is a known issue, due to new codebase not recognizing the old blocks.  This will be fixed going forward.
4) "I DONT SEE MY MINERS!!" - the UI will catch up due to Global caching. You can always look at real time data directly via the api by using https://api.getblok.io:4443/api/pools/ergo1/miners/<YOUR ADDRESS> 

If you are experiencing another issue, please let us know and we will continue to investigate. Thank you.

✅ Attention https://t.co/2eRiEOP6B4 Miners ✅

We have successfully implemented a fix that will allow for 5 blocks to process in one transaction.  This will allow us to catch up rapidly on block payouts.  

We truly appreciate everyone’s patience as we worked through the issues

 There are certain scenarios that causes people not to get paid when they think they should. It has often been due to pool hopping. But shoot us your address and we will give you the GetBlok.io treatment.

@admin I have added all the rewards and all the payouts and there's a mismatch of 45 NETA. Currently the pool shows no pending balance (0 NETA confirmed owed, 0 NETA unconfirmed owed).

(re @Raul : *@admin I have added all the rewards and all the payouts and there's a mismatch of 45 NETA. Currently the pool shows no pending balance (0 NETA confirmed owed, 0 NETA unconfirmed owed).*) 
 
 blocks are still confirming and the conversion is done at the time of calculation it's not a flat or fixed conversion so that could be some of the "difference" if you don't have shares pending in another block


[06/22/2022 11:55 PM] Glitch_04#0000
The contract converts based off the oracle and price of Neta as it arrives

is the balance supposed to go up like a regular pool or is this pool different?

The balance goes up when the blocks are confirmed / processed for the shares you submit currently there are still several blocks pending


[06/23/2022 2:20 AM] Glitch_04#0000
Your shares are likely still not yet confirmed as they are from those pending blocks you can see the pending blocks from https://ergo.getblok.io/blocks

 That’s correct.  As long as the miner is compatible with Autolykos you will be fine.

hello raul can you please check 9gzkyRpRPY92PEnqAGRQDcAEyHaDzKDSYFSxKhheHFAYcTFmjng I have been mining and switching for a while this is my mining address in my wallet, the main address in my wallet is 9gKc1su6Jzvo74cDsfoMcZw1m1t8vuhWVt1UWUnDr42NNCUhgtZ can you please check? I've been using the second address before as well

(re @VonRoy : *Hey guys ! Is NETA price estimation simply a translation of ERG's price? Or are other factors that decrease it? Thanks @admin*) 
 
 Neta is calculated based on the erg mined and then its converted to Neta with a 22% increase.


[06/23/2022 12:42 PM] HipHopBlond#9606

That first address timed and got an error when trying to enter it.  Which usually means it’s not connected.   The second address loaded but showed 0 workers.  Maybe just cache delay.


[06/23/2022 1:13 PM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
Also oof comet.  That’s why no rewards.  They haven’t found a block in days.   Very low hashrate there so it’s almost like solo mining.


[06/23/2022 1:18 PM] HipHopBlond#9606
might be a switchup in wallets and setting the wrong one as default in Nautilus?
I know it doesn't make much sense but just a thought, anyway you cleared things up with comet hahah, thank you for taking the time

 Just because you got nothing paid doesn’t mean something is wrong.  There are factors that we don’t control which could cause for you to not be paid, such as pool hopping etc.  @Arohbe can you look at this and get an answer pls

 Unfortunately. Not yet.  But you can use a standard hashrate calculator for now and then convert erg to Neta plus 22%.

 1 ERG is not equal to 1000 NETA. That is just a conversion used for min payments. Right now, 1 ERG = ~300 NETA.

 @Arohbe  can reach out if not already to set that up. Need to understand if it fits within the model we currently have launched or if its something different. The more we can stay within the current model for COMET and AnetaBTC the easier/quicker we can launch for you.  Not that we can't do something custom for you, but would take longer/more effort.

After switch to Neta pool for 60 hours
In brief notes:
There is a progress at all ( block processing/UI ) but still not the best or what we want it 

First 24 hours don't expect any reward , it begin after 25-27 hours

Payments work smooth for some hours and stopped for hours without a reason

UI need to be in real time (need more accuracy)

Thanks for the good team who work hard doing a big progress in less time

 You get 22% more erg when swapping the Neta.  I guess if you call that meaningless than I don’t know what you  consider to be meaningful.

The pool mines a block.  Block reward is 51 erg rn.  That then takes the exchange rate from ergodex and adds 22% to be distributed to the miners.

 Not really an auto convert.  AnetaBTC team funded 10m neta to the smart contract.  So the neta is coming from the pool not the dex.


[06/24/2022 3:28 AM] Arohbe#0000
Think we’re saying the same thing in a sense


[06/24/2022 3:28 AM] curcifertechies0#0000
well there is no human interaction, its smart contract right ,, so auto.. xd… ok got it..

Giving the pool another crack, hopefully you’ve sorted payments out - I’ve lost a considerable amount of Neta but ill put it down to bugs.

(re @Craze : *Giving the pool another crack, hopefully you’ve sorted payments out - I’ve lost a considerable amount of Neta but ill put it down to bugs.*) 
 
 You should not have lost a drop of NETA. If there was an issue we suggest you complete a ticket.  We can’t fix what we don’t know and miners not getting paid is not something we take lightly.

[06/24/2022 1:38 PM] Nick#0000
I have a suggestion for the UI that would answer of a lot of the constant questions about payment status: add a block counter to the personal stats that the miner has participated in that is pending to be paid and number of paid blocks. This type of stat would really help cause it's kind of hard to tell from the blocks page what you may have mined in or not. I think it would have a positive impact on retention and less questions

Like with the blocks section, the number of blocks that have been found and are in process. Like there are 10 blocks pending smart contract execution not reflected in your balances. It's tough to see from the blocks section how much are due to be paid. When I switched my one rig I converted NETA too soon with because I though I had been paid out.

 There are still 11 blocks to process that were found in the last 8 hrs.    The payment processing can pause for multiple reasons. 

-Waiting for blocks to be available in sets of 5 
- Maintenance being done on payout manager 
- Payments being processed on other pools. 

We are working to improve this further but in the meantime there could be minor gaps in processing.  

As soon as those blocks are paid it will reflect in your payments and rewards table.  We can explore if there is a better way to reflect this that may make it easier to view.

guys the exchange rate for neta->Ergo keeps going up..
will it go back down eventually or will it keep going up without end and should exchange for it real time??
there is no data has to why it goes up


[06/24/2022 4:28 PM] VillageBC#0000
What does "unspent" in the transaction for payouts? It looks like I have some ERG that's paid out but not yet hit my wallet.

you paid too much transaction fee maybe

it'll come back


[06/24/2022 4:30 PM] VillageBC#0000
Yeah, not worried. GetBlok has always paid out even if it's been delayed. Just curious what it meant in the transaction block explorer


[06/24/2022 4:35 PM] Red1l#5832
Does the rate neta->ergo goes up, because of the 22% bonus?? We get more neta than minted Ergo and when exchanged ... the liquitidy for Ergo goes down quicker? 🧐

(re  : *<Red1l> Does the rate neta->ergo goes up, because of the 22% bonus?? We get more neta than minted Ergo and when exchanged ... the liquitidy for Ergo goes down quicker? 🧐*) 
 
 The exchange to Neta is based on real time when the block is processed.  The neta comes from the pools smart contract not the liquidity in Ergodex.

Have the upgrades to the dashboard been completed? If so, it still is not picking up completed blocks for unconfirmed rewards. If not, please cheerfully ignore this. Lol

 Depends when you are counting the 40hrs.  I would see how many blocks haven’t been paid yet within that time frame and add that to your balance.

[06/26/2022 4:38 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @J : *But many blocks after 779305 has paid status, i did't receive it......*) 
 
 Blocks are processed in batches of 5 so each payment reflect 5 blocks worth of payments.


[06/26/2022 4:39 PM] Arohbe#0000
And posts the last block# paid on the table.

(re @J : *I thing dashborad should show more message clearly......*) 
 
 Yeah we’re working on some updates that will make this clearer.  The focus has been on improving block reward processing speed.  Intended to do that following the launch just got side tracked by 1000 miners and 1th lol.


[06/26/2022 4:58 PM] Arohbe#0000
Once we improve the payment processing we will revert back to improving the way the stats display on the UI.

The NETA price is always down......

all the selling right after they mine


[06/27/2022 10:54 AM] curcifertechies0#0000
Actually thats what I said a few days ago… 
If u mine neta, should just hodl it first, it will accumulate price since neta pool will auto swap erg to neta, which mean increasing the price of neta because neta supply stay same if no one swap it immediately after got neta.

Netapool -> mine ergo -> auto convert to neta with 22% bonus.

Thus neta supply minus
Erg supply on neta rise

Thus price will raise little by little.
but its up to you when to swap as well, ur strategy. 🤣🔂

 the price is given by ergodex, but there is no autoswap on ergodex from erg to neta. The aneta team provided 10 million NETA tokens independent from the dex to the mining pool. so everytime someone sells neta on ergodex, there is more neta in the ergodex pool and less erg, that's why the price is always dropping.

 Exchanges on Ergodex can go down a lot when Neta staking is live. I hope soon.

 No you should be fine as long as you are still in the pool.

 Depends how long your are off the pool.  If you run outside the Pplns window. You may have to re-select your subpool.

 Thats bad luck. I've got 310k shares and 3 blocks found. I should be in solo pool. Haha. Then my luck would drop.

 You’re always best using our global point.  Ergo.GetBlok.io:3056 or 4056 for SSL.   It will point you to the closest server.

 Balance doesn't appear until the blocks have processed


[06/30/2022 5:25 AM] Cai#0000
It just than it been mining for more than hours


[06/30/2022 5:32 AM] Glitch_04#0000
Check the blocks page it shows how many blocks are pending (there are several) and what their status currently is, compare that with the "time" you have been mining. The contracts are what handle the payouts.

The payment processing can pause for multiple reasons. 

-Waiting for blocks to be available in sets of 5 
- Maintenance being done on payout manager 
- Payments being processed on other pools. 

We are working to improve this further but in the meantime there could be minor gaps in processing.  

As soon as those blocks are paid it will reflect in your payments and rewards table.

 ?


[06/30/2022 3:17 PM] allcloudy#0000
(re @gentleberry : *?*) 
 
 Its already faster than 720 confirmations....what issue are you encountering?  We start processing as soon as 20 confirmations are done for a block.


[06/30/2022 3:19 PM] gentleberry#0000
Oh no issues. It's just payment seems too slow. All i got today is like ~400 NETA. 1200+ pending.


[06/30/2022 3:19 PM] gentleberry#0000
I was just wondering if there was any upgrades going on

 it shows you have 14k shares so you are connected and those will be paid when the pool you are in hits blocks and they confirm

RT @SonOfATech: I mined 6 of the blocks on @GetBlok_io this month which would equate to 306 ERG. But I was using the NETA smart pool which ended up being 402 ERG total. Was better off on NETA than solo mining.

Hi all! A couple of questions:
1. Can I use KuCoin wallet for mining aNeta?
2. I connected to the aNeta smart pool just yesterday afternoon, now I have accumulated 700 NETA tokens, but only 0.001 Ergo came to the KiCoin wallet 2 times, when can I receive the NETA payout?


[07/05/2022 10:33 AM] rubenserg#0000
i thing you cant use kucoin wallet, probably burn neta tokens . just install nautilus wallet for mining and hold neta or shell in ergodex w nautilus


[07/05/2022 11:59 AM] Glitch_04#0000
Don't use exchange wallets for native assets (neta etc) they don't support the token so you lose them

 That means you already got 2 neta payments. You get an additional little ergo for each payment. but since they don't support neta, you lost them i think.

Hi i was mined in comet pool last week. I did stop mining to the pool because 3 days = 0 block. Do i still get payout when finding a blok ?


[07/05/2022 1:42 PM] Red1l#5832
You're paid in Neta not Ergo, if the token doesn't exist on the exchange, you can't mine into it.

But the token is not burned, it belong to the exchange now because they have the key (not your key, not your Crypto)

The only way to recover your Neta tokens, it's if Maybe in a distant future the NETA token is supported by kucoin, and if they use the same public key as your current Ergo one.

(re @Rickykris23 : *Hi i was mined in comet pool last week. I did stop mining to the pool because 3 days = 0 block. Do i still get payout when finding a blok ?*) 
 
 No you will need to remain on the pool to be included in block rewards.

 Do you mean you have issues seeing it connected on the dashboard of the website? or the rig is not connecting to the stratum ?

1.58 g/h in  average. But its ok now. I think that is in right way. Just the Personal Stats in my Dashboard don't show the complete info.  The 6th of July was so poor in mining. But its possible. 985.66 neta.

No. it's all good now.
👍


[07/10/2022 2:28 PM] gentleberry#0000
Hey @admin
I'm curious. when i mine ergo in this pool, shares are sooo much more than other pools. why's that?


[07/10/2022 2:34 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @gentleberry : *Hey @admin

 Rn I believe it stores shares for two week time period and if reflecting that number.


[07/10/2022 2:40 PM] Emphasisx#0000
I’m liking the lowered difficulty. My 3080 mined a solo block.


[07/10/2022 2:41 PM] Emphasisx#0000
Also, I don’t know if it’s known but the pool stats is showing the incorrect network difficulty. It shows 279.k instead of 1.2P


[07/10/2022 4:02 PM] allcloudy#0000

Yeah let me look into why it changed


[07/10/2022 4:27 PM] allcloudy#0000
(re @K : *Yeah let me look into why it changed*) 
 
 Curious if it’s due to partitioning the regions.  Although I thought you said that column isn’t used from the shares table.


[07/10/2022 5:12 PM] universalbutter#0000
(re @Arohbe : *Morning @gentleberry @universalbutter are you still experiencing issues?*) 
 
 It’s been better now. Yeah it’s intermittent but for now everything is good


[07/10/2022 7:50 PM] curcifertechies0#0000
Do u know how many hash power needed to be able to solo mine comfortably?


[07/10/2022 8:29 PM] Glitch_04#0000
personally wouldn't attempt it under 10gh and that's going to still be hit and miss


[07/10/2022 8:30 PM] Murr#9913
yeah I have about 8.5gh and I am not having any luck solo mining despite the difficulty level going down


[07/10/2022 8:30 PM] Glitch_04#0000
haven't checked lately but thought it was in the range of 15-20gh where things used to level off


[07/11/2022 7:49 AM] curcifertechies0#0000
Oh man, 10gh… im still 1gh haha… by looking at my personal stats it was able to blockmined 4, i wonder it is just a bug UI or am i really found a block..

i guess my luck is only when pool mining, solo mining will be catastrophic, even with 1000% luck wont trigger a block


[07/11/2022 7:50 AM] curcifertechies0#0000
The UI just an illusion of short euphoria (just joke)

Are subpool hashrates shared, but payouts based on what pool you are in? Or is each pool on it's own finding it's own blocks.

(re @VillageBC : *Are subpool hashrates shared, but payouts based on what pool you are in? Or is each pool on it's own finding it's own blocks.*) 
 
 Each pool has it own hashrate and the blocks found are split between the miners on the Subpool only.

Forwarded from GetBlok News and Announcements: ⚠️ *ATTENTION MINERS* ⚠️ 

We are working with Ergo developers on a reoccuring issue with our Ergo Nodes.  This issue causes nodes to fall out of sync, which have high probability of causing orphan blocks to be found by any of our subpools.  

Our architecture leverages redundant pairs of nodes for any one region, which reduces the likelyhood of this happening, but if both of those nodes are out of sync, this issue will occur.

While we are still narrowing down this bug, please be certain that ALL MINERS who mined on an orphan block will be rewarded. We are working with Ergo Foundation to ensure all miners affected are taken care of.

This is not the first time this has happened in the history of mining pools at ergo, and therefore many who have been with us for a long time know that when we say you will be rewarded for an issue that is not your fault or bad luck - we mean it.  

As always - thank you for your commitment and patience, pls feel free to reach out in our #🆘-support  channel if needed.

Honestly, any plans of paying on the Comet Pool? There's still a confirmed block from July 3rd pending payment.  Now there's 2 new blocks mined unpaid. Don't want to waste hash power if no one is monitoring valid payout issues. That's 10+ days pending payout? Thanks in advance.


[07/14/2022 6:26 PM] K#0000
The problem with comet pool is that payouts for all pools are batched together. We can only payout when 5 blocks have been hit, no more and no less. I did try paying out the comet pool earlier but it had some undesirable effects during pre-processing.


[07/14/2022 6:28 PM] d3b0m3n#0000
Ah, someone with real answers. Noice. I'm that case I'll get back to mining those last 2 needed blocks 👍


[07/14/2022 6:28 PM] K#0000
So to solve that problem, I'm implementing batch sizes per pool, that will allow certain pools to payout say every 1 or 2 blocks, while bigger pools can payout every 3 to 5. But its not so simple to implement so its taking some time. The change will likely come out at the same time plasma pools launch for the default and solo pool.

[07/14/2022 6:30 PM] K#0000
Essentially we're gonna be having a big payout upgrade, likely early next week, to implement all of this. Once that happens comet pool will payout quicker. Though if it can find 2 more blocks then we won't have to wait at all.

how do i know if this worked?


[07/15/2022 4:59 PM] Flying Pig#0000
If you have the bat file in a different folder than the trex.exe then the first line should be

cd /D <path>

That will change the working directory to the path.
After that just enter the actions you want performed without the path . I'm not familiar with all the setx variables but as long as you are in the directory where trex is located it should work.

Nice!


[07/16/2022 4:15 AM] smanda25#0000
(re @Flying Pig : *If you have the bat file in a different folder than the trex.exe then the first line should be

cd /D <path>

That will change the working directory to the path.
After that just enter the actions you want performed without the path . I'm not familiar with all the setx variables but as long as you are in the directory where trex is located it should work.*) 
 
 so i started mining yesterday, when will i see erg coming into my wallet?

 Hmm let me take a look.


[07/16/2022 12:45 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @smanda25 : *anyone help please*) 
 
 How long have you been mining? Keep in mind the pool pays out 5 blocks at a time.  Which means 5 blocks need to be found on the pool.


[07/16/2022 12:46 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @Craze : *Looks like the dashboard is stuck again*) 
 
 Wdym stuck?

i am mining with my gaming laptop. seems like i will get 0.1930 ERG daily. not sure if its highly profitable

[07/16/2022 12:53 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @Craze : *The blocks page has been like that quite a while*) 
 
 I’ll take a look.  Are you saying the payment status has been the same?


[07/16/2022 12:54 PM] Craze#0000
The confirmation status too, but yeah…unless its a caching issue, the last block i see is 794567


[07/16/2022 12:55 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @Craze : *The confirmation status too, but yeah…unless its a caching issue, the last block i see is 794567*) 
 
 That’s correct that was the last block found.


[07/16/2022 12:56 PM] Craze#0000
The last 4 blocks have been confirming at 0% for quite some time.


[07/16/2022 12:57 PM] Arohbe#0000
Looking into it now.


[07/16/2022 2:12 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @Craze : *The last 4 blocks have been confirming at 0% for quite some time.*) 
 
 Not sure what happened but looks like it fixed itself.

 Can you please try again and see if it works? If not please take a screenshot and send the url you are using.

 Look at the announcements above.  It means how difficult it was to find your block in laymens term.  Lower than 100% is good luck, above 100% is not so good luck

(re @Xhariel : *Also, seems like no rewards have been distributed after block 796223 (aneta subpool)*) 
 
 Currently the other pools are processing (solo and standard) once completed it will begin processing the neta pool. (Which looks like it already begun)

 Not really based on time but on block finds and which pool has 5 blocks ready to process.

 Sonic cleaner is good although i've had mixed results. Some cards that were just overheating fail to post after sonic cleaning. So I stopped doing unless 100% necessary.


[07/19/2022 9:56 PM] allcloudy#0000
Sonic cleaned ~ 50 cards, about 3 or 4 failed. So < 8% failure rate

if they were submerged cards prob would've still worked 😂


[07/19/2022 10:07 PM] allcloudy#0000
could that have been it? sure. I doubt it.  I used same process. After sonic cleaning, they get submerged in alcohol, and then blown dry by air compressed air. Then sit for 24 hours before being put online.

 How long have you been mining?  Last payout was about 3.5 hours ago.  Currently 3 blocks pending on neta pool and it needs 5 to process the next payout.

does it save money if using ups on electricity for mining?


[07/21/2022 5:46 AM] Glitch_04#0000
nope likely increase between the loss of conversion to recharge


[07/21/2022 5:48 AM] Glitch_04#0000
The only way it would reduce would be if the batteries were charged by additional (excess) solar in the day but having a ups battery large enough to run the system over night would be rather expensive depending on the rig

[07/21/2022 11:33 AM] Xhariel#0000
UPS are basically a surge protector + small batery to let you safely turn off your PC/rig. You can have solar + UPS, but the UPS will not act as a overnight battery, the batteries on UPS are realtively low capacity and only serve to give you a short time to safely power down, not to sustain the operation through a blackout/night.

 As part of the Plasma upgrade, all minimum thresholds were set to 0.001. This was to ensure that no balances were kept in the old smart contracts. They should work like normal again, now that the upgrade is complete.

How long these days before unconfirmed balances are updated?

(re @Marcus : *How long these days before unconfirmed balances are updated?*) 
 
 Depends which pool.  The standard pool (plasma) will be much faster.   All the other pools will be the same until they are converted over to plasma.

[07/26/2022 6:02 AM] Glitch_04#0000
depends on how many are in the pool and how many blocks are hit in that period for both pools


[07/26/2022 7:51 AM] Craze#0000
Hey guys, if you join the neta pool before the 5th block is found, do you count towards the rewards on payment? I joined the neta pool before the 3rd block 5 was found and got nothing after payment.

 Yes.  You should have been included if you were submitting shares before the block was found.   What are you using to gauge timing of when you were mining?


[07/26/2022 4:17 PM] Craze#0000

 You’re good.   I realized Block payments are on hold rn while the Neta pool is being updated.  Once completed everything should go back to normal.

The @anetaBTC team has decided to extend phase 2 yet again 😱

Another 5m $NETA will be added to the SmartPool at an 8% bonus.  This will be the last extension before Phase 3 is launched.  We expect this phase to be completed in the next 2 weeks

@Arohbe quick question about sub pool mining NETA. If I switch my rigs over to doing that, are we rewarded with the ERG + NETA? Or just NETA?

 If you're mining normally then you're already in the Plasma pool. Plasma is just a scaling solution that we've implemented (only on the default pool so far) that allows us to pay up to 150 miners per transaction. The previous smart contracts only let us pay 10 people per transaction.

Anyone know when ergopad token will be available to mine on getblok?

(re @JOEM1984 : *Anyone know when ergopad token will be available to mine on getblok?*) 
 
 Afaik when they release plasma token pools, which iirc is a couple weeks away. But I'm sure someone else here will have a better idea


[07/31/2022 6:02 PM] JOEM1984#0000
Ok. I watched sonoftech video and I thought they said it would be on July 31st but I may have been mistaken.

How to mine Ergopad with GetBlok.io
Ergopad is launching a Getblok.io subpool! Miners will be able to directly mine Ergopad while also mining Erg. Find out how it all goes…

No block found in the last 12h? Damn


[08/01/2022 8:25 AM] jukihu#0000
Is this mean I can get 100% mined ERG + 10% of ergpad?

90% ERG, 11% Ergopad


[08/01/2022 8:32 AM] jukihu#0000
Hmm, question is 1% extra of ergopad come from where


[08/01/2022 8:33 AM] jukihu#0000
I thought 1.1x the current exchange rate is get ergopad less instead?


[08/01/2022 9:39 AM] Eddie#0000
pool fee for the ErgoPad smartpool is too high. Why would we want mine at a 3% pool fee to earn 10% extra on 10% of what we mine? When we can mine pure ERGO at 1% pool fee (and buy ergopad if you want to)? 
Ergo pool = 99% earnings. Ergopad pool = roughly 98% earnings.


[08/01/2022 9:44 AM] Eddie#0000
Don't get me wrong, i really like what getblok is doing in general, but please don't set up traps like this.

[08/01/2022 9:56 AM] jukihu#0000
Unless we understand wrongly, else this smart pool is like disadvantage to me


[08/01/2022 10:03 AM] koutelier#0000
The pool fees is because running a sub pool is costly if I have  understand that right . The rewards are set up by the token not getblok


[08/01/2022 10:08 AM] Eddie#0000
well either way it's not a good product and comes across as a trap and/or greedy to me. I'm not paying an extra 2% to getblok just to get 1% back from ergopad. It's bad for ergopad. I'd rather buy ergopad in that case. 

Ergopad guys said they were afraid people would sell off what is mined and affect price negatively - well if you just mine ergo and buy ergopad you would do both Ergopad and yourself a favour.

So this giveaway is up for a long time and people failed to register their $ergo address so if people doesn’t  register their $Ergo address until next week it will be canceled. And instead of that we will give 10k $COMET token to our ONIRIC NFT HOLDERS

 Well they want to distribute more tokens and keep the investors safe . It’s up to miners if they want to mine in this sub pool . Imo this was a good call.


[08/01/2022 10:21 AM] koutelier#0000
I talk as an investor and not as a miner .


[08/01/2022 10:44 AM] Eddie#0000
of course it's the miner's choice - i'm just saying if you do, you're giving away 3% of your earnings to getblock for the "privilege" of getting 10% extra on your 10% back from ergopad, in other words reducing miner income and potentially causing ergopad inflation, just to line the pockets of getblok.

 I don’t think any pockets are getting filled mate . We asked about that fee when we wanted to put comet there and this fee is just for the expenses that are needed in order the sub pool is up.


[08/01/2022 10:55 AM] Eddie#0000
ok, so is the getblok default pool so much cheaper to run then, or is it running at a deficit at 1% fee?


[08/01/2022 10:57 AM] Eddie#0000
i get they need to cover expenses and i want them to make money, but that the ergopad subpool product is not the way to go.

Trying to understand few things about mining as well


[08/01/2022 11:02 AM] Eddie#0000
Yep, well i'd be happy to be proven wrong, it's just that I'd like to warn other miners that the ergopad pool will lose you money compared to mining erg in the default pool and buying ergopad on ergodex. 🤷‍♂️


[08/01/2022 11:07 AM] Xhariel#0000
You're right, righ now the reward is too little to compensate for the increased fees. But I think this is something that should be discussed with the ergopad team and not getblock team imho


[08/01/2022 11:08 AM] Xhariel#0000
Thanks for the warning anyway, I've accumulated some NETA already and switched to the ergopad pool before realizing I was actually losing compared to normal ERG pool.


[08/01/2022 11:09 AM] Xhariel#0000
Please update us if you get in contact with the Ergopad team and you get any update on this, would love to participate in fairer distribution rather than just trading for ergopad.

 Thanks for bringing it up in the ergopad channel just now, and i agree with both of you that getblok is not the right target of critisism, so sorry for that.


[08/01/2022 11:27 AM] Xhariel#0000
No worries mate, we're all here to help each other out. Mining is rough atm but I believe there is future for cryptos


[08/01/2022 11:27 AM] Eddie#0000
hope they make the pool competitive so i can contribute to the distribution on ergopad!

(re @Eddie : *Don't get me wrong, i really like what getblok is doing in general, but please don't set up traps like this.*) 
 
 No traps here.  Our mining fees were established when we first launched SubPools.   It was broken down 1% for standard mining 2% for solo and 3% for SubPools.   This is all to cover infrastructure costs to operate the pools.  I find it somewhat disrespectful to come and say we are “lining our pockets” without understanding the costs associated with running a global back end infrastructure.    I can appreciate criticism but that’s taking it too far.

 The mining economics is not ours to determine, it is the subpool project's responsibility.  I suggest you go vocalize your discontent with the Ergopad folks. Or, don't use it. You sir have the power to do what you want to do.

[08/01/2022 5:58 PM] Glitch_04#0000
well the default pool hit 3 after that long stretch but needs 5 to pay out


[08/01/2022 5:59 PM] Glitch_04#0000
well 4 total so one more


[08/01/2022 5:59 PM] Glitch_04#0000
in that time period


[08/01/2022 6:00 PM] the_batman_24#0000
Okay, great


[08/01/2022 6:00 PM] the_batman_24#0000
Ill let things stabilize , then ill switch back to getblok

 Yep I’ve been on it almost all day still no blocks found. Maybe if we had a lil more hash it would do better.

 I just saw that. Well the wait continues. We are getting some more hashrate in the pool so that will help. I’ll give it another 24hrs and see what happens.


[08/02/2022 12:35 AM] jukihu#0000
Can someone help explain about this? What does it mean 8% increase in mining reward? Do I get 100% normal erg mining reward and also 8% in neta?

No, neta pool pays in neta


[08/02/2022 12:36 AM] EctomorphicThor#0000
You get 108% rewards versus a normal ergo pool, but it’s paid in neta


[08/02/2022 1:15 AM] jukihu#0000
(re @EctomorphicThor : *You get 108% rewards versus a normal ergo pool, but it’s paid in neta*) 
 
 Hmm, do you know how does neta come out that extra 8% to the miner?


[08/02/2022 1:18 AM] AffableVillain#0000
(re @jukihu : *Hmm, do you know how does neta come out that extra 8% to the miner?*) 
 
 Smart contract holds a reserve of neta. When a block is mined, it pays miners 1.08 erg worth of neta per 1 erg mined


[08/02/2022 1:23 AM] Arohbe#0000
(re @jukihu : *Hmm, do you know how does neta come out that extra 8% to the miner?*) 
 
 It is also is based on the current exchange rate at the time the block is processed.  So it bounces off of ergodex and will always give you 8%


[08/02/2022 2:35 AM] meatbeater9000#0000
Hmm 4 vega 56 only got me 3.39 ergo pad in the past 24h


[08/02/2022 2:36 AM] meatbeater9000#0000
That’s less than a dollar 😂


[08/02/2022 2:37 AM] Glitch_04#0000
the struggle is real


[08/02/2022 2:38 AM] Glitch_04#0000
I turned off 20 today it's going to be hot all week anyway


[08/02/2022 3:10 AM] EctomorphicThor#0000
Anyone know if you can stake neta?


[08/02/2022 3:11 AM] EctomorphicThor#0000
On any website, or if you can cross chain go Cardano and stake it there?

Hmmm


[08/02/2022 3:31 AM] meatbeater9000#0000
So is it normal for 550mh to only get 3.39 ergo pad in 24h lol


[08/02/2022 3:31 AM] Glitch_04#0000
always depends on how many are in the pool and how many blocks are found


[08/02/2022 3:32 AM] Glitch_04#0000
it was a brand new pool


[08/02/2022 3:54 AM] meatbeater9000#0000
(re @Glitch_04 : *it was a brand new pool*) 
 
 Ah ok that kinda make sense . 1 block found so far


[08/02/2022 3:54 AM] meatbeater9000#0000
hmmm


[08/02/2022 3:54 AM] meatbeater9000#0000
kinda doesn’t make sense I’m wasting 500w for 1$


[08/02/2022 3:55 AM] Glitch_04#0000
could be wasting 500w and hit 3-4blocks as well but likely wouldn't be having this convo


[08/02/2022 3:55 AM] Glitch_04#0000
it goes both ways 😂

Ok I think I found the reason lol


[08/02/2022 4:23 AM] meatbeater9000#0000
last night it was 40 miners connected


[08/02/2022 4:23 AM] meatbeater9000#0000
This morning boom 356 miners


[08/02/2022 4:37 AM] K#0000
(re @meatbeater9000 : *last night it was 40 miners connected*) 
 
 It's only 76 miners at the moment and 50 GH/s. Yesterday it started at 0 H/s. In general you're going to get less blocks on a pool if it started right from 0.


[08/02/2022 4:38 AM] K#0000
Now that things are starting to stabilize a bit, it should get better. Just need to get more blocks rolling in.


[08/02/2022 4:38 AM] meatbeater9000#0000
yeah I thought I would get more pie but a lot more ppl hopped on

 It depends what subpool you're on. You should see an unconfirmed balance now though, we've increased processing speed for all plasma based pools today.

(re @K : *It depends what subpool you're on. You should see an unconfirmed balance now though, we've increased processing speed for all plasma based pools today.*) 
 
 yes, now is more faster process.
just need more better UI with much add. info. much more charts for every worker, and we need also pool sending email when miners stop..
thanks K.


[08/08/2022 12:53 PM] Red1l#5832
it's been a while since we've found a block (default or egopads), so that's why you have no rewards

 It evens out the longer you mine, with a small pool you can't look at 1 day profit cause its not gonna be accurate.

 The Neta pool is still at 5 block batch processing.  Looks like we have 4 waiting on the 5th.  Once found the 5 blocks will payout.

 Not easily.  Would require using a Dex and cex to convert Neta>Erg>Ada>Cneta.  Don’t think there is another way until there is a bridge between Erg and Ada

it is problem that we don't mined any block last 36h on solo pool ?


[08/14/2022 12:56 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @Milan : *it is problem that we don't mined any block last 36h on solo pool ?*) 
 
 Hey Milan are you referring to the pool itself…..or you haven’t found a block in 36hrs?  Last solo block found was about 8hrs ago.


[08/14/2022 1:37 PM] Milan#0000
(re @Arohbe : *Hey Milan are you referring to the pool itself…..or you haven’t found a block in 36hrs?  Last solo block found was about 8hrs ago.*) 
 
 I mean before this two last block, we didn't find almost 36h - it's period of maintenance


[08/14/2022 2:29 PM] Arohbe#0000
Nothing that I’m seeing.   The maintenance only took about an hour yesterday and the pool is functioning as it should since then (all pools would be affected if there was an issue).


[08/14/2022 2:41 PM] blackinsecure#3693
I've been receiving regular payout today, so idk if it's all normal or it was a backlog or something


[08/14/2022 3:39 PM] allcloudy#0000
(re @Milan : *I mean before this two last block, we didn't find almost 36h - it's period of maintenance*) 
 
 No not how this works.  Our pool never goes down, we perform maintenance on regions but the pool overall always is up.


[08/14/2022 3:46 PM] Xhariel#0000
The pool is actually a smart contract in ERG in the end, right?


[08/14/2022 3:47 PM] Xhariel#0000
Or does it need a server to work?


[08/14/2022 3:47 PM] Xhariel#0000
Like unless a bug is found or it reaches max capacity and you need to update/change the smart contracts it should never actually go down


[08/14/2022 8:08 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @Xhariel : *The pool is actually a smart contract in ERG in the end, right?*) 
 
 The pool itself is a standard pool that uses a stratum server just like any other.  The difference is the processing all goes through a smart contract. 

We have multiple global end points.  So when we do maintenance we do them one region at a time so the other regions act as redundancy.  This is the main reason why we tell everyone to use our global endpoint so if we are doing maintenance it will balance the load to another region.  

If we do maintenance to the smart contracts, we still collect and store shares in the back end.  So this will not impact mining either.  However it may disrupt stats reflecting in the UI.

So apparently ergo is flux’s next parallel asset


[08/16/2022 1:15 AM] EctomorphicThor#0000
Anyone have plans for an ergo / flux pool on getblok?


[08/16/2022 1:16 AM] EctomorphicThor#0000
Since flux will be added to ergodex (spectrum)


[08/16/2022 1:16 AM] K#0000
Don’t think we have any specific plans, but it would be very easy to implement


[08/16/2022 1:17 AM] EctomorphicThor#0000
I think it would do very well


[08/16/2022 1:18 AM] EctomorphicThor#0000
Since flux is a main competitor post eth merge


[08/16/2022 1:18 AM] K#0000
We will look into it when flux launches in spectrum, the actual implementation should be very easy to do so not much planning required I guess


[08/16/2022 1:19 AM] K#0000
Do they have any set dates on when it will happen?


[08/16/2022 1:43 AM] Arohbe#0000
(re @K : *Do they have any set dates on when it will happen?*) 
 
 I believe sometime in October.


[08/16/2022 5:24 AM] odiseus_me#0000
The UI was showing that I have mined 5 blocks (since subpooling begun here); yesterday the number dropped down to 4; any idea what is happening?


[08/16/2022 6:33 AM] K#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *The UI was showing that I have mined 5 blocks (since subpooling begun here); yesterday the number dropped down to 4; any idea what is happening?*) 
 
 I have to look more in the UI code a bit, but my guess is it queries up to 1000 blocks and if your block was from before then, it wont show up in the counter. We can change the number pretty easily if necessary


[08/16/2022 7:23 AM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @K : *I have to look more in the UI code a bit, but my guess is it queries up to 1000 blocks and if your block was from before then, it wont show up in the counter. We can change the number pretty easily if necessary*) 
 
 Not a real problem at all, however - as long as you have this number - either call it for what it is (“blocks found within last 1,000”) or just query further into the past.


[08/16/2022 7:25 AM] K#0000
Yeah I'll look into extending it further tomorrow, I figured 1000 blocks would take as long as it did last time but our hashrate increased

Question on the ergopad subpool


[08/16/2022 5:17 PM] EctomorphicThor#0000
1.1x the exchange rate… is that the entire reward, or just 1.1x on the 10% ergopad reward?

few Q. please, If I do solo at cca 1.5GHs, my accepted shared doesn't affect to mininig a block at all ? It's only lucky to find a block with hash power or I have some befefits from shares like PPLNS mining when we mined a block ?

 When solo mining you only get rewards for the blocks you mine. No other benefits involved.


[08/17/2022 12:46 PM] Milan#0000
I know that, but how long I should be mining a 5-10 blocks with 1.5HGHs aprox. and what have an effect through time execpt hash power ?


[08/17/2022 12:49 PM] Xhariel#0000
Depends on your ping to the pool, your personal luck and network difficulty.


[08/17/2022 12:51 PM] Xhariel#0000
With current diff and 100% luck you should be hitting a block every 22 days

Edit: not 22, i fucked up the calculation. Aprox 11.34 days


[08/17/2022 12:51 PM] Arohbe#0000
Someone made this a while ago    Not 100% accurate but can be used as an indicator

[08/17/2022 12:54 PM] Xhariel#0000
You can calculate it yourself, with this formula if you asume 100% luck and no uncles.

NetworkDiff/YourHashrate = secondsToHitABlock


[08/17/2022 12:55 PM] Xhariel#0000
Keep in mind networkDiff is expressed in PetaHash and you are hashing in GigaHash so current calculation would be


[08/17/2022 12:55 PM] Xhariel#0000
1.47 * 10⁶ / 1.5


[08/17/2022 12:56 PM] Xhariel#0000
Which is 980000 seconds or 272 hours or 11.34 days

[08/20/2022 4:07 PM] Xhariel#0000
@Arohbe do you know why miners do not send "reported hashrate" when mining ergo?


[08/20/2022 4:07 PM] Xhariel#0000
Every pool I tried does not show reported hashrate, only actual hashrate


[08/20/2022 4:09 PM] allcloudy#0000
(re @Xhariel : *Every pool I tried does not show reported hashrate, only actual hashrate*) 
 
 Because that's the only statistics that matters.


[08/20/2022 4:09 PM] Xhariel#0000
Not really, I use reported hashrate to check when I have a problem with any of my miners :)


[08/20/2022 4:10 PM] Xhariel#0000
Actual hashrate fluctuates, but reported hashrate is pretty constant


[08/20/2022 4:10 PM] Xhariel#0000
So I have a bot for eth that reads the api of my mining pool


[08/20/2022 4:10 PM] Xhariel#0000
And sends me a telegram message if reported hashrate is lower than what i have configured


[08/20/2022 4:10 PM] Xhariel#0000
But I cant do that with acutal hashrate since it fluctuates


[08/20/2022 4:19 PM] allcloudy#0000
reported hashrate is a goose chase, each miner reports it differently and not accurately. I say actual hashrate is only thing that matters and stale shares because that is what you are compensated for (actual hashrate and valid shares)


[08/20/2022 4:27 PM] Xhariel#0000
It still has an use case, it's the first thing that will alert you of a problem with your miner

[08/21/2022 4:35 AM] Arohbe#0000
(re  : *<RammsteinPT> 3hrs ?*) 
 
 Depends on the pool. Although the total hashrate is ~400gh it’s spread between 5 pools.  It could be 10 min or 10hrs.  The average between all pools is 0.8 hours over the last 100 blocks.

The Ethereum merge will fundamentally change crypto, forever

This may be explosive for other #PoW coins as $ETH miners move over their rigs

The strongest contenders to ride this wave seem to be $RVN $FLUX $ERG & $ETC

But which one is brings the most to the table?👇

once the unconfirmed reaches confirmed you will pay out around 20 erg

Well it depends on what blocks were found in that time.

I stopped mining, it's a nice idea but a ton or variation. Ergo should do something similar to flux. You mine it, you get cumulative rewards over time in other coins. My 2 cent

(re @Arrakis : *I stopped mining, it's a nice idea but a ton or variation. Ergo should do something similar to flux. You mine it, you get cumulative rewards over time in other coins. My 2 cent*) 
 
 Subpooling has that.  You mine ERG and can get ErgoPad, Neta, or Comet.  Only difference it’s not over time.   As bridges are built to connect to other blockchains this will open the door for further assets to be distributed in a similar way.


[08/24/2022 3:59 PM] Arrakis#0000
I know, and I get that. But you get pay for ex in neta, etc. That's how I've seen it. Flux just pays in flux, and dividends get converted and paid in flux over time. Less volatility. I do understand it, but with neta I woke up and conversion was X, then z, then y. I understand it, but just think that although flux is not perfect as it does not support project like ergo, in the future post merge is something ergo should consider as people mine a coin, they may even support other things, but the miner mines ergo, that's what 90 of miners see. Don't know if I explained correctly still.my opinion

 The beauty of smart contracts is that they’re flexible. For example, the ergopad pool pays 90% in ERG and 10% in ergopad (with a bonus added on). Lots of different ways to go about this, in the end its up to the project owners to decide how they want their subpool to work.


[08/24/2022 4:05 PM] Arohbe#0000
Yeah exactly. That’s just how the subpools are set now but appreciate feedback like this because it gives us insight as to what miners are looking for.   I think as Ergo develops and there is future interoperability it will allow for several creative options.   For example possibly mining to a staking contract that stakes the rewards earned and can potentially provide dividends with APR returns.  Lots of possibilities.


[08/24/2022 4:06 PM] Arrakis#0000
I'm comparing to flux as from time to time I do mine it. After Eth, easy of use is key and flux is basic, pool , point miners, returns are X, done. This is also an alternative although more tricky


[08/24/2022 4:07 PM] Arrakis#0000
Calculations wise at least


[08/24/2022 4:10 PM] Arrakis#0000
As the main coin is the payment currency, the broader the support on changing stake etc


[08/24/2022 4:13 PM] K#0000
(re @Arrakis : *I'm comparing to flux as from time to time I do mine it. After Eth, easy of use is key and flux is basic, pool , point miners, returns are X, done. This is also an alternative although more tricky*) 
 
 Calculations wise, it depends on the subpool you use. If you're just looking for a set amount of tokens per rewards then comet pool can do that as well (Full ERG reward + 5000 comet per ERG).

NETA and Ergopad are more complicated because they're token emission is pegged to their price. If price goes down you get more tokens, if it goes up you get less. This can make personal calculations more confusing, but on the other hand you are 100% guaranteed an increase in profitability by doing this.

In the end, its up to you for what you wish to mine. If you want future subpools to work in a certain way, then I would ask project / subpool owners about it. All we do is implement the contracts based on their specifications.


[08/24/2022 4:15 PM] Arrakis#0000
Not a problem, just giving my opinion as we all want to profit and you may have a better way to provide context to them;)

(re @EctomorphicThor : *No blocks since last night ?*) 
 
 Blocks are coming in.  Some maintenance is being done right now and they just aren’t reflecting in the UI.  Sorry I thought the twitter bot forwarded a notice must not have come through.  Will keep you guys updated when we’re complete.  As always, Mining is not impacted.

Although y'all are during amazing updates just be careful in this critical time period during the merge where miners test the waters with ERG mining


[08/24/2022 10:39 PM] MGpai#4313
1) We dont want ERG mining to seem buggy
2) We want as many decentralized miners as we can get!

(re @Milan : *just in the pool*) 
 
 Ok.  Yes we’re aware.  Woke up to an odd drop in our API which was causing the stats not to update.  It was just restored so should be back to normal.


[08/25/2022 2:05 PM] Milan#0000
you should be inform all miners about any crash in the pools


[08/25/2022 2:34 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @Milan : *you should be inform all miners about any crash in the pools*) 
 
 Yes we generally always do.  It was a matter of timing this morning. There was no crash with the pool itself. The API was impacted overnight in the early AM.  It was looked at first thing and restored fairly quickly.  Right around the time you sent a message asking.  Nevertheless, we are planning to implement a notification system that will post issues directly in the UI.   This will help so miners don’t need to check socials for updates.   Apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your feedback.

 Yes they are still combined and then mathematically split.  Still fairly accurate though.

Hey guys, after the maintenence yesterday we're prioritizing block processing (unconfirmed balances) over block payouts (confirmed balances and payments) because processing is a heavier smart contract and we're a little behind.

Payouts should begin tonight once things are ready.

 Why? Let’s just say I mine 30 cards for two days, no updates on issues.. Then all of a sudden it’s realised that there Was a bug and none gets paid for their work last two days. That’s me out of pocket in costs, so the energy comment is valid.

 Depends when you started mining.  We had maintenance and then an issue following that  which was restored last night.   So still some catching up to do on block processing.


[08/27/2022 1:35 PM] davewalitza#0000
ok i thanks. I realized the bug and stopped mining yesterday, but i just returned with my 3-card testbench just to see if its fixed. I can see my balance grow but it stays all unconfirmed with no progress. Ïm on Ergo/Ergopad and have 1,126 Erg in my balance as unconfirmed. My payout threshold is 0,01 Erg. Can you look into it please?

looks like a typical txn, but it's the very first threshold-signed txn on #Cardano testnet by 3 Rosen's guards; a lot of tests and refactors are still remaining.

 10% of your reward is paid in ErgoPad, at 1.1x the current exchange rate.

[08/28/2022 10:21 AM] Glitch_04#0000
GetBlok.io Default Plasma Pool or GetBlok.io Solo Plasma Pool

Is solo still pplsn?


[08/28/2022 10:22 AM] Glitch_04#0000
No you earn when you create blocks so it's a gamble unless you have a lot of hash power


[08/28/2022 10:23 AM] Mrck#0000
So getblock completely erased the option to mine ergo other than doing solo, right?


[08/28/2022 10:23 AM] Glitch_04#0000
No I just listed both options


[08/28/2022 10:23 AM] Glitch_04#0000
The default plasma pool is pplns ergo only

 Everyone starts in the "default" pool you have to select a smartpool

 go to this page on the left click the "subpool" tab https://ergo.getblok.io/SubPoolSet  put the external ip of your MINING RIG (not the local) your wallet address and select the default pool then save it

 That’s odd.  Something must have been changed on your side.  Pools do not switch unless a miners enters their IP address.  It’s set that way for security reasons.

 Hi Frank the 25th is when the maintenance started so payments were paused during that time and then paid out later.  This is why the payment on the 27th was over 50 ERG


[08/28/2022 1:51 PM] Xhariel#0000
Is there any way to see the pool luck/blocks/hash rate by pool instead of the aggregation of all sub pools?

(Or any API endpoint where I can get this info from)

(re @Xhariel : *Is there any way to see the pool luck/blocks/hash rate by pool instead of the aggregation of all sub pools?

 Not currently.  A new API endpoint must be designed splitting the pools out.


[08/28/2022 1:58 PM] Xhariel#0000
Could this be done with reasonable effort? Or is it something you have in your scopes?


[08/28/2022 2:06 PM] Xhariel#0000

(re @Mrck : *This is the thing I have selected nothing yet I'm in the ergopad pool apparently*) 
 
 Is it possible someone knows your ip and address? Not really sure how you could be switched without someone doing it for you manually


[08/28/2022 5:32 PM] K#0000
Default pool is ERG only


[08/28/2022 5:32 PM] K#0000
So switch back to that


[08/28/2022 5:34 PM] K#0000
(re @HelixEvo : *Are unconfirmed/confirmed balances on dash delayed? Mine are both zero for a few hours now. Currently running 4.6GHs*) 
 
 What pool are you mining on? Balances are updated 10 mins after a block is found (unless your on the NETA pool)


[08/28/2022 5:35 PM] K#0000
Currently no blocks so thats why your balance is not updated.

(re @Xhariel : *Is there any way to see the pool luck/blocks/hash rate by pool instead of the aggregation of all sub pools?

(Or any API endpoint where I can get this info from)*) 
 
 You can see blocks here: https://ergo.getblok.io/blocks
Use the tab at the top right to filter by pool

You can see hashrate here:
https://ergo.getblok.io/smartpool

Current effort per subpool isn't possible at the moment, though block effort (which is made after the block is found) reflects the effort put in by only that subpool

 What pool are you on? All pools except NETA have payments going through, and NETA should be fixed by tonight.

im on ergopad


[08/28/2022 9:31 PM] Arohbe#0000
Looks like you earned 1.4erg past 24hrs and .18 for the current block pending


[08/28/2022 11:19 PM] An1M4S#0000
How long does it take for the pool to start paying?


[08/28/2022 11:33 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @An1M4S : *How long does it take for the pool to start paying?*) 
 
 Depends on which subpool you’re on.  Miners are paid following block finds.  So the larger subpools like ergopad will find blocks and pay more frequently. Once a block is found it takes 20 confirmations and then some processing time to pay out.


[08/29/2022 8:20 AM] Xhariel#0000
Using the data from https://ergo.getblok.io/blocks i got the following
From the last 2000 blocks, 186 have been from default plasma pool and out of those 10 have been orphans which is about 5.37% orphan rate, is this normal? Seems like way too high of an orphan rate.

 Sorry, I misscalculated, it's actally 8/186 (4.3%). But that seems way too high too

 Are you using the correct IP address?   Sometimes if you have a dynamic IP it could have changed on you from the last time you tried.

 You can see them in your wallet under tokens.  Also on the pool when your viewing your personal stats you can click on the payments section and a side bar will slide over showing the breakdown of tokens earned.

[09/01/2022 9:28 PM] dadreboi#0000
1 - you can look at their code on github
2 - you can find the average payout your cards usually run for other people and compare that to what you get when running trex. 
3 - keep an ear out to the community to see if you hear anything changing

the prjoect is pretty open and up front with all this, i think it's as good as you could expect from at least viewing their git repository and readme.md


[09/01/2022 10:02 PM] jameskever#0000
thank you. Forgive me please... I'm on github. I see the command line options. But that's not the code to the miner... Are you sure this is open sourced?

(re @jameskever : *thank you. Forgive me please... I'm on github. I see the command line options. But that's not the code to the miner... Are you sure this is open sourced?*) 
 
 Unfortunately, there are very very few optimized miners that are open source.


[09/01/2022 10:03 PM] jameskever#0000
so the statement that I can look at their code on github is not actually accurate?


[09/01/2022 10:03 PM] K#0000
If I had more experience myself I'd make one, but not my specialty


[09/01/2022 10:05 PM] jameskever#0000
nor mine. I just have a problem trusting people.


[09/01/2022 10:05 PM] K#0000
(re @jameskever : *so the statement that I can look at their code on github is not actually accurate?*) 
 
 For all the mining software that I know of? Nope, you can't usually check the code. The open source miners for Ergo are made by members of the EF, but tend to be much less efficient.


[09/01/2022 10:07 PM] jameskever#0000
so the only way to verify fees are as promised I can "find the average payout your cards usually run for other people and compare that to what you get when running trex." or keep my ear to the ground about changes.


[09/01/2022 10:07 PM] Arohbe#0000
One thing to think about is a lot of these miners are used globally and it is a business for them.  So if they conduct foul play and profits don’t line up then it would kill their reputation.  Yes not trustless by any means but supported by hive and some of the larger mining software companies so usually there is good intention.


[09/01/2022 10:08 PM] jameskever#0000
okay... maybe I can swallow that pill.


[09/01/2022 10:08 PM] jameskever#0000
these are questions that made nvminer appealing.


[09/01/2022 10:09 PM] Arohbe#0000
Algos change so the mining software constantly needs to be maintained an updated. Data tables, New coins added etc.  so there is a cost of development that is warranted.


[09/01/2022 10:09 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @Arohbe : *Algos change so the mining software constantly needs to be maintained an updated. Data tables, New coins added etc.  so there is a cost of development that is warranted.*)

[09/01/2022 10:13 PM] jameskever#0000
would be nice to have a benchmark on how much faster trex is compared to nvminer... something tangible that can really win me over. I'm new to all this though. Apparently there may be a glut of gpus flooding the market. This plus the show... I think now's a good time to hammer all this down.

A2000 might be THE BEST GPU for mining after ETH 2.0, here's why! (...
In this video I test the RTX A2000 for mining after Ethereum 2.0 in 2022. I review the mining hashrate, efficiency, profitability and overclock settings for this GPU on over 25 coins. In this A2000 mining review I test it on Ethereum, Ravencoin, Flux, Ergo, Conflux, Conceal, Bitcoin Gold & Aeternity. However, the same coin algorithms are used fo...

 how have you found the performance of cards that have been baking for a long time you buy used? do you notice a difference? I saw some specs on someone trying to game with one that had been mining for a year, some decrease in FPS it showed...


[09/02/2022 9:59 PM] Glitch_04#0000
These were new cards they do run hot so I have them turned down a little but they run from 96.85 -94.81 mh/s   54/74 c @ 69w  on their current settings for Ergo I can turn them up but am waiting on winter.


[09/02/2022 10:00 PM] Glitch_04#0000

They say they announced to close staking pool x. So Its our fault that we did not withdraw. And now we have to fill out a form. People wait for 4 weeks. NO REPSONSE. And the form is now closed because of the limited amount of requests they can handle and reopens when possible. Also the funds have to Come from the founders.. WHY? 

WHY not just autowithdraw, auto hop to new stakingpool or whatever.

This sets be back
ETH/ERG for the send fees
0.5% trade fees on KuCoin
1USDT for transfer of USDT on TRC20

But they've closed temporarily/permanently due to investigations from regulatory agencies (One of the directives was acused of fraud). I lost 600$ there 🤷‍♂️

I prefer using Strike to buy BTC and send over to TradeOgre to swap for ERG.  KuCoin works too.


[09/03/2022 4:36 PM] allcloudy#0000
(re @Xhariel : *I normally do ETH/ERG -> USDT -> Send it to Bitrefill (Prepaid gift cards for amazon and major retailers) via TRC20 (Tron network). 

This sets be back
ETH/ERG for the send fees
0.5% trade fees on KuCoin
1USDT for transfer of USDT on TRC20*) 
 
 Not bad.

Discover Ergo Super Blok Bounty Month - September 2022 - GetBlok.io
As the Ethereum merge to Proof of Stake is closely upon us, GPU miners will be looking for the next best algorithm to mine. While many have already shifted over to other blockchains, we felt inspired to provide miners with a deeper insight to Ergo. To support this effort, GetBlok.io in collaboration with ErgoPad, AnetaBTC, and Comet has an on-go...

(re @allcloudy : *For US, best path I found for erg -> FIat in US is KuCoin -> Binance.us, but you need to exchange Erg to BTC or USDT or something else*) 
 
 I just convert mine then loan against w/ Nexo > pay off repeat for now, you could also withdrawal direct if you wanted might be fewer steps (also less fees) 🤷‍♂️


[09/03/2022 8:25 PM] Glitch_04#0000
would be way easier if someone would convince them to add ERG to their platform 😂


[09/03/2022 8:31 PM] markg87#0000
Why not use KuCoin?


[09/03/2022 8:32 PM] Glitch_04#0000
MEXC / KuCoin are used to convert the issue is getting funds directly out to Fait requires KYC


[09/03/2022 8:32 PM] markg87#0000
Ah ok


[09/03/2022 8:33 PM] Glitch_04#0000
would be easier if there were a platform like nexo that supported it direct


[09/03/2022 8:33 PM] Glitch_04#0000
less fees 😂


[09/03/2022 8:34 PM] markg87#0000
You can order precious metals, pay with crypto, have it shipped to your home..

 Yeah we are working on the fix for this


[09/03/2022 8:40 PM] markg87#0000
Did we really just get 4 blocks today? With the complete pool? Or also backlogged

 Dumb question seen the vid about the whole "quad" mining have you attempted that on the same pool or split rigs completely and launched them solo to see if they have more hits or the same ?


[09/03/2022 8:45 PM] Glitch_04#0000
Random thoughts after seeing that video just never attempted it personally from the additional steps required

 Originally when I first connect they’re all on the same pool. I didn’t leave it that way but it worked for a little while before I started changing them. So I don’t see why it wouldn’t be possible.  Not sure if it would improve chances of finding blocks or anything like that though

 You can trade for USDT and use something like bitrefill to get gift cards

Yeah you can do that with bitpay also it's just a hassle dealing with those cards

its supposed to do 215 but not sure what overclocks to use in erg. Using 100 core 3000 mem from ETH


[09/04/2022 2:26 AM] allcloudy#0000
at $1552.76 a pop, its $7.23/mh

 Not sure which way I'm leaning since we will be doing it in stages first batch is like 33 450w pannels @ around $0.58/watt

thats around 14? ish depending on what they actually put out


[09/04/2022 2:34 AM] Glitch_04#0000
Should cover the small rigs I have for now


[09/04/2022 2:36 AM] allcloudy#0000
you DIYing or having someone build for you? and doing battery storage?


[09/04/2022 2:37 AM] allcloudy#0000
i'm trying to get a rooftop setup for our new facility, about ~57kwh, to power the building power (hvac, heater, lights, etc).  And its a pain because i can't just do it myself, roof is 30+ feet high


[09/04/2022 2:37 AM] Glitch_04#0000
DIY, partner is the electrical wiz we can get close to cost for everything the batteries are tbd it would be grid tie for now


[09/04/2022 2:37 AM] allcloudy#0000
ah that helps big time on cost


[09/04/2022 2:37 AM] Glitch_04#0000
yep


[09/04/2022 2:38 AM] Glitch_04#0000

and this is before the new bill bumps it up to 30% an dmore


[09/04/2022 2:42 AM] allcloudy#0000
right, and cost of electricity which is increasing too


[09/04/2022 2:42 AM] Glitch_04#0000

[09/04/2022 2:44 AM] Glitch_04#0000
(re @allcloudy : *ya and materials.  Anything i order commercial, there is always clauses indicating the material price is not guaranteed*) 
 
 you have a lower rate for power for now though don't you


[09/04/2022 2:45 AM] allcloudy#0000
well its a catch 22.  Yes Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) lock me in, but i could be buying too high as well, all depends on 1) how much power you commit to and 2) when you buy it


[09/04/2022 2:45 AM] allcloudy#0000
right now its a terrible time to setup PPAs


[09/04/2022 2:45 AM] allcloudy#0000
apparently feb-apr next year it will be better time


[09/04/2022 2:46 AM] Glitch_04#0000
ah


[09/04/2022 2:46 AM] allcloudy#0000
it gets cheaper the larger amount of power you buy, like 5 MW and up lol


[09/04/2022 2:47 AM] allcloudy#0000
for little guys (< 5M) at least here in PA you get what the regulated utilities give you, or you shop out of state (and that can be good for residential, but not usually for commercial)


[09/04/2022 2:48 AM] allcloudy#0000
Solar is the way.  But even then its a pain in PA. You have to pay an interconnection fee (that building there? its 9k fee) to grid tie in.  And you are not allowed to do non-grid tied in solar.  And you need to have 3 months of power consumption established before they let you because they are required to buy power from you (net metering), but dont want to risk the grid


[09/04/2022 2:49 AM] Glitch_04#0000
damn


[09/04/2022 2:49 AM] Glitch_04#0000
the tie in is the cost of my first set of panels


[09/04/2022 2:50 AM] allcloudy#0000
The price is based on the kw generated. Plus they bump fees if you go over a certain tiers


[09/04/2022 2:50 AM] allcloudy#0000
I wanted to go standalone, battery storage but cant


[09/04/2022 2:55 AM] Glitch_04#0000
Yeah those stand alone systems with the giant battery are pretty sweet out of my price range 😂

battery tech is crazy expensive


[09/04/2022 2:55 AM] allcloudy#0000
besides, with miners, no power will go unused lol


[09/04/2022 2:55 AM] Glitch_04#0000
Priced out both ways it's almost cheaper to go standard battery and replace them half way through vs standalone


[09/04/2022 2:56 AM] allcloudy#0000
that's a better mix for commercial property (that building), is mixed use - commercial/residential and mining farm


[09/04/2022 2:56 AM] Glitch_04#0000
well not almost it was price wise minus labor to do the swap


[09/04/2022 2:56 AM] allcloudy#0000
regular lead acid batteries?


[09/04/2022 2:57 AM] Glitch_04#0000
I think they were AGM


[09/04/2022 2:57 AM] Glitch_04#0000
We have battery contacts as well


[09/04/2022 2:57 AM] Glitch_04#0000
Lead acids would gas and need a different room


[09/04/2022 2:58 AM] Glitch_04#0000
Preferably not in the building 😂


[09/04/2022 3:03 AM] allcloudy#0000
now there are those LiPo batteries too


[09/04/2022 3:05 AM] Glitch_04#0000
Yeah have a little longer life but higher price


[09/04/2022 6:53 AM] 86u_yhLx30#0000
easy q, with all the new miners/ ergo price move


[09/04/2022 6:53 AM] 86u_yhLx30#0000
is the neta still 8% above?


[09/04/2022 6:55 AM] K#0000
Yes, the 8% tracks the exchange rate of NETA/ERG, so you always get +8% regardless of number of miners and/or price of ERG.

Yeah well I can’t do solar in my condo because my roof isn’t large enough


[09/04/2022 10:31 AM] EctomorphicThor#0000
What pool is giving the best $ right now between neta/plasma default/ and ergopad?


[09/04/2022 10:32 AM] EctomorphicThor#0000
I see ergopad has most gh, but I wonder if the default pool’s 0% fee would be yielding more


[09/04/2022 10:32 AM] EctomorphicThor#0000
Anyone run stats recently ?

(re @86u_yhLx30 : *if im mining neta under eg. I've recently started (last night) and its showing the shares in the dashboard but confirmed balance and unconfirmed balance remain at 0*) 
 
 Hey 👋 The Neta pool currently processes payments in batches of 5 blocks.  Once the 5th block is hit and goes to “pre-processed” it will update your unconfirmed balance.   You can track this on the blocks page. https://ergo.getblok.io/blocks

Block processing will improve significantly when phase 3 is launched as it will be plasma based.

I recently moved my rigs over to here. How does the mining work?


[09/04/2022 3:53 PM] Patos27#0000
A portion of erg is sold to get a portion of what we are mining


[09/04/2022 3:53 PM] Patos27#0000
I’m mining ergopad


[09/04/2022 3:59 PM] K#0000
Yea that’s essentially what happens with the ErgoPad pool. 10% of your ERG payout is “exchanged” for ErgoPad, you then get an extra bonus on top of that.

 You should be able to see your threshold in the personal stats page.  It will be right below any unconfirmed/confirmed balance you may have.

Also depending which pool you are on blocks may be a bit slower (for example the default pool) as some are smaller than others.

[09/05/2022 2:45 AM] Arohbe#0000
Yeah that makes sense.  The last block paid was about 9hours ago.  One was found a little over an hour ago and then another one just about 5-10min ago.  You will be paid for those two shortly (once processed)


[09/05/2022 2:46 AM] J#0000

 Smaller pool will be a little less consistent but all balances out, similar to ETH if you mined on a smaller pool


[09/05/2022 2:47 AM] Arohbe#0000

[09/05/2022 3:09 AM] Arohbe#0000
Hmm the infamous 3090ti.   I dont know much about them from an OC standpoint.  You could try my standard 3090 settings and see how that performs for you


[09/05/2022 3:10 AM] Arohbe#0000
Actually try to pair your 3090


[09/05/2022 3:11 AM] Arohbe#0000
You may also want to give it a little more wattage.  Go up to 270 PL and boost your fan on the 3090 to 85-90% must be steamy where your rig is


[09/05/2022 3:11 AM] J#0000
Yeah i happened to get a good deal on ebay during an auction for a new one lol


[09/05/2022 3:12 AM] J#0000
It is about 85 in the room with a big fan blasting on it and another blasting out the window


[09/05/2022 3:13 AM] J#0000
Believe it or not these Temps are pleasant to look at just earlier today before I switched from eth to erg my vram on the regular 3090 was 102


[09/05/2022 3:14 AM] Arohbe#0000
Oh yeah, ERG is usually a 20-25% drop on thermals.


[09/05/2022 3:15 AM] Arohbe#0000
Here is what I use for a 3090

(re @Philippsi : *Hi Guys, can anyone help me? I'm mining for over 12 hours now and haven't received any unconfirmed or confirmed balance. Is this normal?*) 
 
 Hey @Philippsi payments are dependent on block finds for the pool.  So it depends how many blocks were found in that 12hr time period.  Then processing time applies before it hits your unconfirmed balance.   Here is a reference of our payout process https://www.getblok.io/2022/06/26/smartpool-payout-reference/

{Embed}
https://www.getblok.io/2022/06/26/smartpool-payout-reference/
SmartPool Payout Reference - GetBlok.io
Currently payments are processed after 20 confirmations from the block find. This is typically less than 1 hr or shortly after 20 confirmations for the block find. *Note:  As we are continually improving our code, currently all SubPools process payments in batches of 5 blocks. This means that payments are not initiated until 5 blocks are...

(re @BATMAN : *Wait till 24 hours is up 👍*) 
 
 you gotta wait till the pool finds blocks bro the higher % pools finds them more but getblok has a unique pool system that pays you slightly more.


[09/05/2022 3:30 PM] Philippsi#0000
It says the pool has found 16 Blocks since I started mining.

(re @J : *It's still get neta instead of ergo?*) 
 
 Depends which smartpool you’re on.


[09/05/2022 6:41 PM] Arohbe#0000
AnetaBTC pool is an exchange pool that gives you 8% additional rewards during the conversion to Neta 

Comet is a bonus pool and gives you comet on top of ERG 

Ergopad is kind of a hybrid giving you 90% ERG 10% ERGOPAD with a 10% bonus on the Ergopad portion.


[09/05/2022 6:42 PM] Arohbe#0000

one Q. please - with old diff. pool at 1.4P and today 2.88P - that's mean today is need twice more time to minig a block ?

(re @meatbeater9000 : *Is NETA almost done with Phae 4*) 
 
 Working on phase 3 launch currently which is currently being tested prior to launch.   Phase 2 has been extended a few times and there is still Neta remaining in the emissions contract to be mined.

(re @Milan : *one Q. please - with old diff. pool at 1.4P and today 2.88P - that's mean today is need twice more time to minig a block ?*) 
 
 In theory yes.  The network difficulty will adjust as the hashrate increases to maintain the average block time.

[09/06/2022 11:08 PM] Arohbe#0000
The erg payment does reflect on your dashboard when you’re mining to that pool.  You switched to neta so it does not show as the daily payment anymore.  However if you click on the payments it will show you the erg you earned while mining on that pool.   Now that you’re on NETA pool and have a balance pending your payout will process once you hit your min payout.  

The Neta pool is a little tricky as it processes 5 blocks at a time versus the plasma pools that are much faster.

Does this mean it’s harder to mine NETA


[09/07/2022 4:34 AM] Glitch_04#0000
Has more hash power means more probable blocks but also less to go around share wise


[09/07/2022 4:35 AM] Glitch_04#0000
it's hard to gauge you want a goldilocks zone not too little not too much etc

 Look at your pending balance lower your minimum and you would be paid as soon as it confirms


[09/07/2022 8:42 AM] Glitch_04#0000
You have to wait for the confirmation to approve for the payments


[09/07/2022 8:44 AM] BATMAN#0000
(re @Glitch_04 : *You have to wait for the confirmation to approve for the payments*) 
 
 Hi, it's been suck like that for over 4 days now ,


[09/07/2022 8:51 AM] Glitch_04#0000
(re @BATMAN : *Hi, it's been suck like that for over 4 days now ,*) 
 
 From what I can see it looks like you are waiting on the blocks to confirm the aneta pool only pays out after 5 confirmed blocks until they update it to the new system, I don't have the ability to look further into the system then that you will need to wait for the developer or one of the owners to look at the Aneta payments when they are available in around 4 hours (it's like 3:50am)


[09/07/2022 8:53 AM] Glitch_04#0000
also your payout is 5000 aneta and so far unless the next block is the 5th to confirm it looks like you would need to reduce your payment or wait for the additional blocks to reach your payout


[09/07/2022 8:55 AM] Glitch_04#0000
You will get paid for your work but it only gets paid out in accordance with the pool production (how often that subpool hits blocks), how the contracts are set to pay and how you have set your minimum payment.


[09/07/2022 8:59 AM] Glitch_04#0000
When they update the aneta pool's contract it will be able to payout faster like the others but until then it still has the 5 block payout minimum.

BATMAN numerous people have explained this to you.  If you don’t understand our pool and our processing maybe this pool isn’t for you.   We sent you the payment tx that you received and explained the neta process.  Going to multiple chat rooms and people in the chat rooms is making you look really bad.  If you want to understand the projects that’s one thing and we’re here to help but you have been bashing multiple projects here on Ergo and I’m tired of it. The great thing is you have a choice.   If you don’t want to mine here, don’t.   If you don’t want to stake on ergopad, don’t.  But stop spamming the chats with your nonsense.

(re @meatbeater9000 : *or I need 10Gh*) 
 
 You could try with 8.5gh but with the recent difficulty spike will all be luck based.


[09/07/2022 4:22 PM] Xhariel#0000
(re @meatbeater9000 : *Hey so I got about 8.5gh*) 
 
 Asuming 100% luck you'd find a blokc every 4.3 days


[09/07/2022 4:22 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
Ahh


[09/07/2022 4:22 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
Hashrate will probably increase more


[09/07/2022 4:23 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
After merge


[09/07/2022 4:23 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
if I have different IP addresses mining into the same wallet. Will I have more luck

RT @no1smove: @ErgoMinnow We thought we knew all that mining pools could do until @GetBlok_io came along. The kind of creative devs that Ergo attracts, plus the functionality and expressiveness of the protocol, I honestly think Ergo has the potential to offer Defi tools other chains will only dream of

 1 gpu, can hit a block,


[09/07/2022 5:11 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
Hmm I see


[09/07/2022 5:11 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
So more GPUs more entries


[09/07/2022 5:12 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
hmm 4.3 day / block

(re @meatbeater9000 : *hmm 4.3 day / block*) 
 
 At current difficulty and assuming 100% luck


[09/07/2022 5:30 PM] Xhariel#0000
You might have better or worse luck, and difficulty can change (But that will affect pool mining too)


[09/07/2022 5:33 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
yeah probably better to solo under 10g


[09/07/2022 5:33 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
maybe can go solo arund 15-20


[09/07/2022 5:44 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
should i just pick neta


[09/07/2022 5:44 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
cuz it has less hashrates?


[09/07/2022 6:08 PM] JOEM1984#0000
How does block bounty work? I thought snapshots would be taken and we would receive extra rewards daily.


[09/07/2022 6:26 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @meatbeater9000 : *cuz it has less hashrates?*) 
 
 Neta is a good pool but keep in mind it processes slower than all the other pools currently.   Once phase 3 launches, it will be plasma based and be much faster.


[09/07/2022 6:26 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
Ah so it is final phase


[09/07/2022 6:26 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
After that can’t mine NETA yeah?


[09/07/2022 6:29 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @JOEM1984 : *How does block bounty work? I thought snapshots would be taken and we would receive extra rewards daily.*) 
 
 Basically at the end of the week we will capture all the miners day to day activity.   The miners who mined that day will receive the extra rewards.  So calculating daily but paying weekly.


[09/07/2022 6:29 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @meatbeater9000 : *Ah so it is final phase*) 
 
 We’re already discussing phase 4 😜

AnetaBTC Phase 3 Update:  

We will be pausing payments on the AnetaBTC pool to integrate phase 3.  Payments will not be issued during the integration period.  However, mining will not be impacted and the rewards stored will be applied to the new Phase 3 emissions contract.  Further details regarding phase 3 will be announced by the AnetaBTC team prior to launch of the pool which is expected to be tomorrow.  Miners do not need to take any action as you will automatically be placed in the new pool.  Additionally, phase 3 will be plasma based which means block processing will be reduced to single block batch sizes.  This will drastically improve block processing and payment time on the AnetaBTC pool. We appreciate your patience during this amazing integration with Aneta Angels NFTs.

[09/08/2022 6:24 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
I have about 5-6 rigs if that increases the chances


[09/08/2022 6:25 PM] Arohbe#0000
May take a few days or a week to find a block with that gh.  Maybe more with the diff increase.  A moving target but that hashrate is solo worthy.


[09/08/2022 6:35 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
hmm


[09/08/2022 6:36 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
I am slowly increasing my hashrate a tho . I block is 44 ergo?


[09/08/2022 6:36 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
If I can hit 1 in 4 days it still even out as I pool mine lol


[09/08/2022 6:36 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @meatbeater9000 : *I am slowly increasing my hashrate a tho . I block is 44 ergo?*) 
 
 48 currently.

(re @meatbeater9000 : *If I can hit 1 in 4 days it still even out as I pool mine lol*)

ah ok


[09/08/2022 6:37 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
well quite doesn’t make sense to risk


[09/08/2022 6:37 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
If I already avg 52$ a day on ergo


[09/08/2022 6:39 PM] Arohbe#0000
True.  A few weeks ago would have been way better with lower diff.  Now it’s iffy but possible.


[09/08/2022 6:39 PM] Arohbe#0000
Youll find them just a matter of when and the ongoing frequency.

Maybe we should look into ways to increase chances for soloing


[09/08/2022 6:41 PM] meatbeater9000#0000

(re @meatbeater9000 : *welp 🤷🏻‍♂️maybe provide node services ?*) 
 
 funny you mention this, we are planning to offer a "Mine at home" feature where we will deploy a node+stratum closest proximity to you for ultra low latency. Edge Computing.


[09/08/2022 7:04 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
Yassssssss


[09/08/2022 7:04 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
Something like kaspa?


[09/08/2022 7:06 PM] allcloudy#0000
Not quite, a service to offer certain clients the lowest latency possible when mining.


[09/08/2022 7:06 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
maybe people can promote their nodes and chain mine together under 1 node as solo . And even out the reward based on hashrate %


[09/08/2022 7:06 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
ah okc


[09/08/2022 7:06 PM] meatbeater9000#0000

 oh what we have in store for you guys.  its gonna get there


[09/08/2022 7:07 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
Anyways to stabilize the hashrate from fluctuating


[09/08/2022 7:07 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
Nice


[09/08/2022 7:07 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
I believe !


[09/08/2022 7:35 PM] BATMAN#0000
(re @dadreboi : *quad? from the brief video i watched you can hit many sub pools at once to different wallets, yup*) 
 
 Basically, for me ,is easiest to use the 1 wallet, Nautilus, just add another address or even 4 address's from the same wallet, 
Excellence 💪

 we are processing neta blocks to catch up, rest will be enabled shortly


[09/10/2022 2:46 AM] allcloudy#0000
This is the last hurrah on the legacy Neta pool, so we are trying to get people caught up on payments. All the other pools are blazing fast in payment processing so shouldnt take long for them to catch up once we switch back to normal mode


[09/10/2022 3:07 AM] allcloudy#0000

 Alright we are back to normal programming, all other pools are in normal processing time

Hi guys, just so i get this clear, does switching sub-pools cause issues with unconfirmed balances? Because this morning i had 12+erg in unconfirmed with a threshold of 10erg….now its saying i have 6.3 confirmed and 3.09 unconfirmed….where have the other 3+ gone? Thanks.

no balance here @ ergo/ergopad


[09/10/2022 4:19 PM] Fishb00ne#0000

[09/10/2022 4:31 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @Fishb00ne : *and ergo/comet pool. been minging for 20 hours+/-*) 
 
 Comet hasn’t found blocks in a while.  Very very small pool


[09/10/2022 4:31 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @Fishb00ne : *no balance here @ ergo/ergopad*) 
 
 If you DM me your address I can check for you.


[09/10/2022 4:32 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @meatbeater9000 : *24h still nu show payouts T_T set payouts at 5 ergo*) 
 
 Same here.


[09/10/2022 4:33 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
Hm maybe top 1 priority we can look into better gui


[09/10/2022 4:33 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
For viewing/ tracking mining rewards


[09/10/2022 4:33 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
also somewhere to check hashrate validations , stale , rejected etc


[09/10/2022 4:38 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @meatbeater9000 : *Hm maybe top 1 priority we can look into better gui*) 
 
 We have a dev onboard as of last week working on updates.


[09/10/2022 4:38 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @meatbeater9000 : *For viewing/ tracking mining rewards*) 
 
 As for this you can track when you click on the payments section on your personal stats.


[09/10/2022 4:39 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @meatbeater9000 : *also somewhere to check hashrate validations , stale , rejected etc*) 
 
 You can see your hashrate if you click the contribution stat section.


[09/10/2022 4:40 PM] Arohbe#0000
Also keep in mind @meatbeater9000 neta is still 5 block processing til phase 3 launches.  That’s probably why you aren’t seeing updates.


[09/10/2022 4:43 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
ahh


[09/10/2022 4:43 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
Ok I think only 3 blocks found on the pool so far today


[09/10/2022 4:43 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
maybe I should just payout to 10 ergo


[09/10/2022 4:44 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @meatbeater9000 : *maybe I should just payout to 10 ergo*) 
 
 Honesty id keep it low for the first payout.


[09/10/2022 4:44 PM] Arohbe#0000
With your hashrate it should be a nice chunk anyways.


[09/10/2022 4:45 PM] Arohbe#0000
Make sure the payments flow right before setting Min payout so you get used to it


[09/10/2022 4:45 PM] Arohbe#0000
But again phase 3 was built on plasma so won’t really be an issue anymore


[09/10/2022 4:46 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
I mined NETA around phase 2 for a bit


[09/10/2022 4:46 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
sorta familiar


[09/10/2022 4:46 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
welp! Good to know! Thanks a lot


[09/10/2022 4:47 PM] Arohbe#0000
Ah cool. Same stuff.  We had too many blocks for the contract to process so had to set it to batches of 5.   Plasma solved that.

Forwarded from GetBlok News and Announcements: ⚠️ ATTENTION MINERS ⚠️ 

Recently a miner was scammed trying to get support with staking.  They were told it was an Ergopad tool to fix staking.  

As a reminder to please be aware of scams.  No one from this platform or any platform built on Ergo will ever ask you for your wallet address and password.  If you ever receive a DM from “support” it is likely a scam.

Also 3rd party links should never be used to fix wallet issues.  This are scam sites.


[09/10/2022 8:28 PM] Scheisuss#0000
is the getblok.io neta mining reliable now?


[09/10/2022 8:28 PM] Scheisuss#0000
i think i should use my neta angels and take the extra 9%...


[09/10/2022 8:29 PM] dadreboi#0000
the p3 will be using plasma so faster i believe. @Arohbe can correct.


[09/10/2022 8:32 PM] Scheisuss#0000
For every 1 ERG mined, that wallet will earn 1.09 ERG (not including 3% subpool mining fee) paid in the equivalent amount of NETA.


[09/10/2022 8:33 PM] Scheisuss#0000
my bad english.... for better understanding, the 3 % mining fee are coming at the end to that?


[09/10/2022 8:33 PM] Scheisuss#0000
so its like 6% extra with the netas?


[09/10/2022 8:33 PM] dadreboi#0000
nope....0 angels get 3% which covers the reward


[09/10/2022 8:33 PM] dadreboi#0000
so they get 0% bonus


[09/10/2022 8:33 PM] dadreboi#0000
3 angels get 9% bonus - 3% fee


[09/10/2022 8:34 PM] Scheisuss#0000
ah ok

[09/11/2022 2:47 AM] Glitch_04#0000
tbh I'm not sure I still have faith in the project anymore but what I do hold is all I'm willing to risk long term until they have a functional product


[09/11/2022 2:48 AM] dadreboi#0000
thanks for being honest, from what i've seen in the back stage when i help out with some random coding, they are a great bunch and are working hard. i'm for sure holding and and very confident in those guys.


[09/11/2022 2:49 AM] Glitch_04#0000
It's hard to say I do see some work like the staking portal but everything is incomplete there's no real detail to the project

appears to be


[09/12/2022 4:09 AM] Glitch_04#0000
because it depends on how often the pool finds blocks and the total hashrate of the pool fairly sure the aneta pool had a dip in luck as well but @allcloudy  or @Arohbe  would have to confirm


[09/12/2022 4:15 AM] allcloudy#0000
Guys we can’t be second checking everyone’s payout.  Look at the rate of blocks found for the pool, difficulty level, and hash rate.  Read up on PPLNS.


[09/12/2022 4:15 AM] allcloudy#0000
If it’s something blatant or you are not getting paid after a while, open a support ticket in discord or email us.

maybe a way to export all the payouts and dates


[09/12/2022 1:18 PM] Xhariel#0000
I can make that for you @meatbeater9000 this evening/tomorrow. All the info should be there in some endpoint or in the interface itself.

erm im talking about general on website


[09/12/2022 1:19 PM] Xhariel#0000
Should be a pretty easy bookmarklet that jus executes some JS code


[09/12/2022 1:19 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
u can directly export


[09/12/2022 1:19 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
like 2miner or flexpool


[09/12/2022 1:20 PM] Xhariel#0000
Yeah, I'm talking about that, but instead of being in  the webpage since im not associated with getblok I usually build myself some scripts to fetch me the data I want


[09/12/2022 1:20 PM] Xhariel#0000

Fyi for neta miners concerned about their confirmed balances prior to the phase 3 upgrade:  

we believe we narrowed down the issue and hope to have a fix for you this afternoon.  Don’t worry, your confirmed balances are fine.  We’ll track it down and make sure everyone receives what they are supposed to. We have always done that and will continue to.  Just give it time for us to resolve it.

Forwarded from GetBlok News and Announcements: ⚠️ Attention AnetaBTC miners ⚠️

We identified that previous balances shown prior to implementation of phase 3 are still within the phase 2 contract.   We will have a fix that will flush out the balances later today.  We apologize for the inconvenience and as always will ensure everyone is paid out appropriately.  We appreciate your patience.  Thanks.

how long wait payment?


[09/13/2022 5:46 PM] Arohbe#0000
Intel sorry accidentally deleted you message along with some spam.  You can check the pinned messages.  All pool payments are fine.  However if you were on the neta pool during phase 3 conversion we do have some minimum payouts that still need to be released from the phase 2 contract.   Working on it now.  Thanks.

 Same here, I think it's a good way to diversify income. The server components gets really expensive. I've been looking at some of the 3rd party on demand rentals but it's hard to calculate what the revenue/utilization rates would be

 Right, it’s completely different server components and gpu lineup than what is used for mining, so hard to buy one asset/multiple customers.

Not being in the AI/HPC space also harder to properly formulate a business case.  Now, the infrastructure (power/space/cooling) is all useable.

 A4000s are efficient enough and they can be connected bridged with nvlink. Last time I looked at the rentals there were a good amount of rigs with a4000s and 3090s. I'd like to get a warehouse but it's hard to bank on 100% mining revenue without having an uncorrelated revenue stream. I can see it would be a big headache managing client HPC rigs and I don't think a lot of miners are willing to shell out the rigs costs

 We are looking to add a display that shows all tokens in your balance.  This way if someone jumps around on pools they can see all of the tokens they have pending.

 Is it possible to add the function I mentioned above while u at it 😎


[09/14/2022 4:46 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @meatbeater9000 : *Is it possible to add the function I mentioned above while u at it 😎*) 
 
 It’s something we can def look into.  Basically just a calculation of rewards based on how many shares submitted by rig against total shares submitted.


[09/14/2022 4:47 PM] Arohbe#0000
But curious what’s the use case other than just being a cool stat to know.


[09/14/2022 4:47 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
Oh yes


[09/14/2022 4:47 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
hmm maybe when ur on a large scale operation


[09/14/2022 4:47 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
You put it down in excel


[09/14/2022 4:49 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
Each rig use how much power each day, earn how many tokens , at which price


[09/14/2022 4:49 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
Minus power cost


[09/14/2022 4:53 PM] Arohbe#0000
Hmm.  I can see that being of use.   definitely something to consider.


[09/14/2022 4:58 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
Ty kind sir! So far it’s a bit hard to keep track especially with the new +9% reward

 You can stake your Neta or provide liquidity for additional rewards

Are there penalties for invalid shares?


[09/14/2022 7:29 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @Nick : *Are there penalties for invalid shares?*) 
 
 You can get banned if you submit too many invalid shares.


[09/14/2022 7:29 PM] Arohbe#0000
I think like 50%


[09/14/2022 7:30 PM] Arohbe#0000
They also do not count.  Generally you should be >99% valid shares.

i did try to config other coin settings, so took a few rigs off


[09/15/2022 3:39 AM] meatbeater9000#0000
but the reward in difference is kinda huge


[09/15/2022 3:40 AM] meatbeater9000#0000
or it has to do with blockfind


[09/15/2022 3:40 AM] meatbeater9000#0000
in the past 24h


[09/15/2022 3:40 AM] Arohbe#0000
Block find and price movement


[09/15/2022 3:40 AM] Arohbe#0000
you will always get the same % increase compared to the dex price


[09/15/2022 3:41 AM] Arohbe#0000
so if neta price drops you will technically get more tokens


[09/15/2022 3:42 AM] Arohbe#0000

that makes sense


[09/15/2022 3:43 AM] meatbeater9000#0000
its just moving slow and finding blocks slower


[09/15/2022 3:44 AM] Arohbe#0000

Yikes, we’re at 110TH


[09/15/2022 10:20 AM] Xhariel#0000
The diff will skyrocket to compensate for all the extra blocks that are being created


[09/15/2022 10:21 AM] Xhariel#0000
The network is producing 4x more blocks than the target


[09/15/2022 10:21 AM] Xhariel#0000
So, the diff will at the very least 4x


[09/15/2022 10:32 AM] Craze#0000

NVIDIA and AMD


[09/15/2022 2:35 PM] buLL#1017
I will start configurating my NVIDIA because it's where I have more hashrate!


[09/15/2022 2:35 PM] Arohbe#0000

 You can use NB miner or LOL if you want to use one miner for both.

 All Europe has similar situation and I'm not big enough to look for hosting or deals with the power company. I've total 3 rigs with 24 GPUs and they are not even using server cades, just open air frames. 

So hosting is impossible due to those two reasons, nobody is offering it at decent prices and I'm unable to send it as it's not prepared to be on a facility.

 Didnt know other eu countrys have similar problems just talked today with my boss from work and he sayd he searches for a contract with a power company for 50ct and he would be happy if he findes some


[09/15/2022 3:37 PM] Xhariel#0000
My only alternative is solar, but my place has low irradiation and it would also mean like 30k investment for any meaningful generation 🙃


[09/15/2022 3:37 PM] JoeyK2#0000
Anyway i will look into hosting but right now idk how much more it would be profitable because of all the hashrate ergo got today and will get. I am also pritty small miner with like 3 rigs

What's the advantage for block time targets of around 2 mins versus something like eth that had 13/14 sec block times?


[09/15/2022 7:57 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @Nick : *What's the advantage for block time targets of around 2 mins versus something like eth that had 13/14 sec block times?*) 
 
 Good question. Maybe security?


[09/15/2022 8:00 PM] Nick#0000
Ya, I have no idea. There has to be some reasoning behind it. If the block rewards and times were reduced the block distributions might even out rewards to the pools


[09/15/2022 8:02 PM] Nick#0000
Any ideas on where I might find that information on the block times?


[09/15/2022 8:07 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @Nick : *Ya, I have no idea. There has to be some reasoning behind it. If the block rewards and times were reduced the block distributions might even out rewards to the pools*) 
 
 Well also keep in mind ergo is limited supply.  Eth wasnt.


[09/15/2022 8:07 PM] Arohbe#0000
So I’m sure it’s tied to supply and emissions as well.

emissions would be dropping like a stone


[09/15/2022 8:16 PM] Nick#0000
(re @Arohbe : *So I’m sure it’s tied to supply and emissions as well.*) 
 
 In theory if they block time target was 30 seconds and the block rewards were cut down to 12 Erg it would be the same emissions daily.


[09/15/2022 8:16 PM] Arohbe#0000
When he said block distributions it struck me lmao.

[09/15/2022 8:17 PM] Arohbe#0000
We decide


[09/15/2022 8:18 PM] Arohbe#0000
That would require a soft fork potentially where a vote would be required.  Miners control the vote. Well pools do.  Just another reason why one pool holding all the hash is not a good thing.


[09/15/2022 8:18 PM] Arohbe#0000
EIP-27 just passed recently and was very similar.


[09/15/2022 8:19 PM] Arohbe#0000
Extended emissions by cutting down the block reward

(re @Arohbe : *That would require a soft fork potentially where a vote would be required.  Miners control the vote. Well pools do.  Just another reason why one pool holding all the hash is not a good thing.*) 
 
 If a pool only solves one block a day versus having the potential to mine more blocks it would technically be more efficient in terms of gpus spending time no solving blocks?

(re @Arohbe : *That would require a soft fork potentially where a vote would be required.  Miners control the vote. Well pools do.  Just another reason why one pool holding all the hash is not a good thing.*)

 What's the bulk rate on the xc3s?


[09/15/2022 10:58 PM] allcloudy#0000
EVGA hard to negotiate bulk at the moment, specially xc3s which are in short supply.  Prices range from low to mid $500 USD


[09/15/2022 11:01 PM] allcloudy#0000
I am working on an allocation of 3070s and 3080ti xc3s


[09/15/2022 11:15 PM] Nick#0000
(re @allcloudy : *I am working on an allocation of 3070s and 3080ti xc3s*) 
 
 What hashrate/wattage do 3080tis run? 3080 is the highest 30 series I have and I haven't gotten the efficiency anywhere close to my 3070s


[09/15/2022 11:16 PM] Nick#0000
I like the 3060ti's, they are pretty close in efficiency to 3070s


[09/15/2022 11:17 PM] allcloudy#0000
I’ll get you the data I have it all.  3060ti are sweet but unobitanium at wholesale prices

What can we offer to miners to bring hashpower on getblok? Let's gather some ideas


[09/16/2022 12:04 AM] Nick#0000
(re @Darkkknight111 : *What can we offer to miners to bring hashpower on getblok? Let's gather some ideas*) 
 
 I wonder how the miner retention is or if they are hoping on/off


[09/16/2022 12:08 AM] Nick#0000
I think part of the problem is the miners connect and mine for a couple hours and they don't see a block being hit for a couple hours or a different subpool hits the block and they don't see rewards coming in.


[09/16/2022 12:10 AM] Nick#0000
Potentially, if the pool hashrate is combined and then rewards are distributed to all the miners based on what pool they are in would help with retention (I have no idea if this is even possible or how difficult this would be)


[09/16/2022 12:11 AM] Nick#0000
It was discouraging for me when NETA goes on a lucky run and Ergopad goes dry for a long time


[09/16/2022 12:12 AM] allcloudy#0000
(re @Nick : *Awesome, thanks!*) 
 
 This is based on my data of distributor prices we (GetBlok) are able to get.  Hashrate is ballpark, some we have validated some are based on public info.

 What overclocks do you run on the 3070s? Those efficiency numbers seem low for 3070s my average is around 1.3-1.5


[09/16/2022 12:20 AM] Nick#0000
Was there another attachment with the pricing?

Definitely the crypto with the highest jump in hashrate. It’s not even close


[09/16/2022 1:45 AM] EctomorphicThor#0000

Haven’t looked at any news today. How’s the pool doing?


[09/16/2022 2:22 AM] EctomorphicThor#0000
With the diff spike, it’s going to be hard to find consistent blocks until we get above 1th in a single pool

 Exactly ...this will be great if its possible......thatswhy i also stop mining with neta pool...because every sub pool behave like a different pool...which is not good for miners who are not able to run there for 24×7.....less profitable for them...

 @Arohbe any possibility of combining the whole getblok hashrate as one....and then distribute the rewards based on the selected pools.....


[09/16/2022 3:23 AM] Arohbe#0000
(re @shivshuttler : *@Arohbe any possibility of combining the whole getblok hashrate as one....and then distribute the rewards based on the selected pools.....*) 
 
 Not currently.  Would required a complete rebuild and all of the projects would have to agree.  Kirat Cheese can fill you in on how complex it may or may not be


[09/16/2022 3:50 AM] shivshuttler#0000
(re @Arohbe : *Not currently.  Would required a complete rebuild and all of the projects would have to agree.  Kirat Cheese can fill you in on how complex it may or may not be*) 
 
 There is not doubt that it will be very complex.....but to become a successful pool it will be best if it behave like a pool not a dashboard for different pools......
Suppose i am able to run my rig for 18 hours in day.....can anyone guess which pool is most profitable for me...for now it is 2 miners...and before it is nanopool....but its really bad for decentralisation and dont want to do that.....
Yes someone is able to run rig 24×7 for whole year than it doesn't matter ...but i think miner like gamer and miner from places where electricity cutoff are normal it really hard mine 24×7 ...thats why they choose pool with the most hashrate


[09/16/2022 3:56 AM] shivshuttler#0000
I really want that getblok become a success and mine with the pool....but by joining the subpool and  waiting for subpool to find a block while other subpool are getting block found...then suddenly my electricity cutoff...then my subpool will find a block...what i got ..nothing....
And i think there will be alteast 10- 20 more projects in future who want to work with getblock....then again all the hashrate will be divided even more


[09/16/2022 4:00 AM] shivshuttler#0000
I think atleast the OG 10-15 Terahash ergo miner would have switched to getblok if it worked like that....


[09/16/2022 4:14 AM] Seabass#0000
With varying electrical cost a PPS might attract different miners then pplns


[09/16/2022 4:18 AM] allcloudy#0000
Nope PPS is against the grain of what all of this stands for.  Pool hopping is not what we want.


[09/16/2022 4:19 AM] allcloudy#0000
There is a reason for the evolution of things, such as PPLNS

[09/16/2022 5:51 AM] Nick#0000
(re @Mrck : *Pretty unfair not doing it this way.*) 
 
 Its tough out there, especially with everyone's electricity rates. A partnership with a mining farm that would be able to provide stable hasrate. BBT is an OG about decentralization and the smartpoolin and goverenance sounds right up there alley.


[09/16/2022 5:53 AM] Mrck#0000
How can they advertise and bring more hr if the purest of the mining pool doesn't sign blocks because the HR is spread in uther useless coin like neta.


[09/16/2022 5:54 AM] Nick#0000
Maybe implementing referrals/affiliate codes to SOAT and miners and maybe some sort of loyalty program for retention


[09/16/2022 5:55 AM] Nick#0000
(re @Mrck : *How can they advertise and bring more hr if the purest of the mining pool doesn't sign blocks because the HR is spread in uther useless coin like neta.*) 
 
 Its about involing miners in the defi space. Neta has a very active development team and has a lot on their roadmap


[09/16/2022 5:56 AM] Mrck#0000
(re @Nick : *Its about involing miners in the defi space. Neta has a very active development team and has a lot on their roadmap*) 
 
 Currently neta has nothing delivered to date and they have been out for over a year. I really hope they pull it off but come on why more neta?


[09/16/2022 5:58 AM] Nick#0000
(re @Mrck : *Currently neta has nothing delivered to date and they have been out for over a year. I really hope they pull it off but come on why more neta?*) 
 
 Maybe it's an educational piece but they still make up a third of the hashrate so others seem to be buish on their development and long term prospects


[09/16/2022 5:59 AM] Mrck#0000
What dissapoints me is that they drove through  the revenue collection using ISPO, nft and token trading yet they still convice miners to mone with them... oh well. Btw I have neta in my wallet but I don't trade.

 Has nothing to do with fairness or pureness, if it was simple to implement we would've by now

This is just the beginning of the defi space and look at what the tokens on eth became.

[09/16/2022 6:00 AM] Mrck#0000

 I get your point I suppose the business model evolved into this and I can only complain ha


[09/16/2022 6:00 AM] K#0000
But will take time to write new code out, modify smart contracts, change how emissions work, etc.


[09/16/2022 6:01 AM] K#0000
Also would rather wait til things settle down after the merge before rushing into decisions that change our roadmap (for example collectivizing all the hashrate defeats the purpose of user-made subpools which a lot of people also want)


[09/16/2022 6:04 AM] K#0000
Until then all we can hope for is more hashrate to join the pools, which will also negate the problem. If it continues to be an issue then we don't have much of a choice but to change things.


[09/16/2022 6:05 AM] Mrck#0000
Because the revenue of the pool literally gets splitted its internal pool miners I can't even call this subpooling whitebranding. so then the getblock poll neta miner should be called neta mining pool alone and appear as a stand alone one  in the list of public pool miners, you get me?


[09/16/2022 6:05 AM] Rickykris23#0000
It is also unfair when you stopmining on subpool. If you are not hop in when pool find a block. You get nothing. Even you sent hundred thousand share. It happened to me on COMET pool few months ago


[09/16/2022 6:08 AM] Nick#0000
(re @K : *Until then all we can hope for is more hashrate to join the pools, which will also negate the problem. If it continues to be an issue then we don't have much of a choice but to change things.*) 
 
 I think we are missing the lazy miners. If I had to guess the majority of get lok miners keep up with all the benefits. The Ergo niche turned mainstream and is competing pretty closely to Etc in hashrate.


[09/16/2022 6:09 AM] Mrck#0000
I personally give 0 f about the subpools other than ergopad because they are doing some really good work yet my contract was initiated with getblok and now I'm being "penalized " by the design of the smart contract because I'm mining in the generic pool and that one has fewer miners.

 Definitions change 🤷‍♂️, according to the Ergo twitter subpooling means the ability to mine tokens. That was never the definition I had in mind but I think that's how most people have probably learned about the term now.

In that respect, neither my or your definition has any effect on what people think when they hear the term.

 Hey 👋 welcome.  The pool is Pplns based so rewards are paid as blocks are found.  The pool calculates your percentage of shares submitted and then pays based on that ratio.   Block status by pool can be tracked here https://ergo.getblok.io/blocks

(re @K : *Has nothing to do with fairness or pureness, if it was simple to implement we would've by now*) 
 
 True ...we are just asking is it possible??

(re @K : *Until then all we can hope for is more hashrate to join the pools, which will also negate the problem. If it continues to be an issue then we don't have much of a choice but to change things.*)

This 16 is rediculous

Is there any issues with payouts on the default subpool? I've had a confirmed balance for a few days that hasn't paid out yet.

 It's in the photo. Set for 0.7

(re @d3lta19 : *Is there any issues with payouts on the default subpool? I've had a confirmed balance for a few days that hasn't paid out yet.*) 
 
 No issue with payouts.  Block finds are very slow right now.  The next block found should push out your confirmed balance.


[09/16/2022 4:44 PM] d3lta19#0000
(re @Arohbe : *No issue with payouts.  Block finds are very slow right now.  The next block found should push out your confirmed balance.*) 
 
 OK. That's kind of what I was thinking, but there has been quite a few block finds since my balance went confirmed and no payout. i'll give it another couple blocks and DM you if nothing happens. Thanks.


[09/16/2022 5:46 PM] Xhariel#0000
(re @Arohbe : *About 325 blocks.  Expected to come down a little.*) 
 
 How does that even happen? It's supposed to be increaing even more... With 164TH it should be 19,68PH diff, and that's without taking into account the average block time recently has been super low, to keep emissions in check they should be compensating therefore increasing diff even mroe.


[09/16/2022 5:48 PM] Xhariel#0000
It's not that I want DIFF to be hight I just want to understand how it works, it seems so counterintuitive that we still have this delay by choice and now if it reduces diff it will deviate even more from 120s per block


[09/16/2022 6:27 PM] RelevantData#9545
Does holding Aneta Angel nft's provide any perks for mining Erg on getblok?

 Yeah it’s weird.  Yesterday it was estimating 32ph at 198th.  We dropped a little bit in hash so is that why?   Not really sure tbh.  But agree my understanding is that it is to balance the emissions and control the block time back to the 2min target.


[09/16/2022 6:54 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re  : *<RelevantData> Does holding Aneta Angel nft's provide any perks for mining Erg on getblok?*) 
 
 Yes if you are mining on the Neta pool you will receive additional rewards for holding an Angel in the same wallet you are using for mining.

can someone explain to me what is smart pool about


[09/16/2022 11:16 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @NazhanHamdan : *can someone explain to me what is smart pool about*) 
 
 Sure its basically a mining pool that uses smart contracts to process alot of the pool data on chain. (share calculations, payments, pool data such as fees) This gives you as a miner more transparency that the rewards the pool is earning is being paid out appropriately. 

In addition to that


[09/16/2022 11:16 PM] Arohbe#0000
Hit enter too soon lol


[09/16/2022 11:19 PM] Arohbe#0000
In addition to that we use the smart contract framework for other usecases like voting in the past for EIP-27, a donation platform for Ukraine, but also SubPools which allows us to make multiple pools below ours using the same smart contract processing.


[09/16/2022 11:20 PM] NazhanHamdan#0000
thanks for the explanation


[09/16/2022 11:21 PM] NazhanHamdan#0000
is the daily profit same as other pool +-


[09/16/2022 11:22 PM] Arohbe#0000
Overtime yes but cant compare on a day to day basis, especially with this insane increase.   Some of the SubPools are token pools for other projects on Ergo.  Some of them provide additional incentives

 Normal now that other pools have 50+TH/S people are dropping off give it time


[09/17/2022 2:37 AM] Alex#0000
(re @Nick : *Potentially, if the pool hashrate is combined and then rewards are distributed to all the miners based on what pool they are in would help with retention (I have no idea if this is even possible or how difficult this would be)*) 
 
 What like p2pool on monero?


[09/17/2022 2:49 AM] Nick#0000
(re @Alex : *What like p2pool on monero?*) 
 
 Like the hashrate would be one pool so 1 th finds a block and it is distributed to miners based on payout preferences. So the block rewards are distributed evenly to all the miners


[09/17/2022 2:59 AM] meatbeater9000#0000
We probably won’t get a pending balance for awhile


[09/17/2022 2:59 AM] meatbeater9000#0000
Cuz we can barely find a block


[09/17/2022 3:01 AM] Alex#0000
Didn't we just find one? And ya p2pool is everyone basically is solo minning but share the rewards of all blocka found


[09/17/2022 3:03 AM] Nick#0000
(re @Alex : *Didn't we just find one? And ya p2pool is everyone basically is solo minning but share the rewards of all blocka found*)

How on earth did the diff go to 21?


[09/17/2022 3:23 AM] EctomorphicThor#0000
When the hashrate dropped down go 131th?


[09/17/2022 3:24 AM] EctomorphicThor#0000
Projected was saying like 13-15


[09/17/2022 3:27 AM] chrostpher#0000
looks like the block time is closer to what is should be


[09/17/2022 3:31 AM] meatbeater9000#0000
it’s the sudden spike in hashrate


[09/17/2022 3:31 AM] meatbeater9000#0000
Pushing difficulty sky high


[09/17/2022 3:32 AM] EctomorphicThor#0000
Yeah but from 16 to 21?


[09/17/2022 3:32 AM] EctomorphicThor#0000
Hashrate is down from the 16 diff spike


[09/17/2022 3:35 AM] Glitch_04#0000
yep and if it remains down then the next difficulty will reflect that


[09/17/2022 3:37 AM] Arohbe#0000

Seems pretty extreme. I get the skyrocket in hashrate. But it feels like the previous Epochs aren’t being taken into account

Unless the hashrate/difficulty/block timing  still hasn’t evened out


[09/17/2022 3:57 AM] Arohbe#0000

[09/17/2022 6:46 PM] Alex#0000
Wow is that just the delay? Diff at 21p yet network hashrate going down so hold on people are turning off.


[09/17/2022 6:47 PM] Alex#0000
Im new to getblok, I was here with that last block. Do we need to have 50,000 shares first before payout? Mines hanging at unconfirmed


[09/17/2022 6:49 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
Total hashrate for getblok is how many gh

Well vs the the entire hashrate


[09/17/2022 6:59 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
das why payout is slow


[09/17/2022 7:00 PM] meatbeater9000#0000

 Is 1.8 GH/s


[09/17/2022 7:21 PM] juangui3000#0000
@meatbeater9000 so is better 2miners?


[09/17/2022 8:38 PM] Glitch_04#0000
(re @juangui3000 : *@meatbeater9000 so is better 2miners?*) 
 
 No it's actually worse for the network because it has so much hashrate it's at risk of a 51% attack


[09/17/2022 8:38 PM] Glitch_04#0000
If the hash power was more even the block creation would be as well


[09/17/2022 8:44 PM] Red1l#5832
It won't last, the profitability is too low, many miners will switch or turn off everything until it's somewhat durably profitable again.

But yeah because of the instability, maybe nicehash like services has enough hashrate to 51% every network right now


[09/17/2022 9:24 PM] EctomorphicThor#0000
(re @juangui3000 : *@meatbeater9000 so is better 2miners?*)

As for payments.  Check the blocks page.  Blocks have been very slow due to the high hashrate and difficulty https://ergo.getblok.io/blocks

I've stopped mining waiting for hashrate difficulty to even down a little. 
But I've left some dust on getblock, like 0.8 ERG prior to the merge, it's like a week of mining nowadays 😅😅

Working on some more updates to the back end during this slow period.  Stats on the dashboard will be impacted during this time.  Mining will not be affected.  Also we will be pushing a small UI update in the next day or two. We will let everyone know once completed.  Thanks

 Im still at the unconfirmed been over 24hours. Guessing its need more blocks found or shares at 50,000 dont know


[09/19/2022 1:13 AM] Arohbe#0000
Hey guys. Please see pinned messages.  Balances won’t reflect properly until updates are completed.

 4.5 min block times


[09/19/2022 5:26 PM] Nick#0000
Once the difficulty drops then more hash will come on drop the block times then difficulty increases miners drop off


[09/19/2022 5:26 PM] Nick#0000
rinse and repeat


[09/19/2022 5:32 PM] EctomorphicThor#0000

Crazy that the last diff adjustment didn’t drop


[09/19/2022 7:50 PM] Red1l#5832
Yeah block time 2 times longer so it'll take 2 time more than usual.

But the up/down difficulty that we had before, will be exponential now with every miners going after profitability.


[09/19/2022 7:51 PM] Red1l#5832
Will go from 20ph to 10ph or less regularly


[09/19/2022 7:52 PM] Red1l#5832
20ph staying longer because of block time increasing as miners drop off the network


[09/19/2022 7:52 PM] Red1l#5832
Not good

[09/19/2022 7:58 PM] Red1l#5832
Hashrate still dropping, so difficulty won't go away any time soon


[09/19/2022 10:25 PM] HelixEvo#0000
(re  : *<Red1l> 20ph staying longer because of block time increasing as miners drop off the network*) 
 
 Is there not a fail safe for this ? Could in theory the chain break if difficulty gets crazy then hash suddenly moves away? Maybe some timer if Block not found after an hour or something


[09/19/2022 10:48 PM] Red1l#5832
I just know not that for a difficulty change we need 1024 blocs, I'm not aware of other conditions


[09/19/2022 10:53 PM] Red1l#5832
We're at 65Th/s right now, dropping to a point where it's gonna be profitable again eventually when the difficulty drop, getting all the miners back for another round at 200Th/s,
 mining 1024 blocs in half a day 
and going back at max difficulty for a week.


[09/20/2022 12:22 AM] Alex#0000
Yes basically a week of high difficulty where even A2000 gpu mine at a lost. Then 1 day at profitability to have everyone flood the network with miners. However with people caring about erg's price to USD and being a bear market hopefully most people will stay off till 2024/25


[09/20/2022 12:25 AM] Alex#0000

Yeah, I stopped everything, cleaned and reorganized my rigs in one place. Now I'm working in my electric installation so I can have 6 mm wires there and internet connection. Also, I will re wire a consumption meter with 6 mm wire so everything is safe to restart mining in a couple o weeks / months.

We're paying the low block times we had and the ammout of erg that was emmited, we were yielding way more that we should have and now it's balancing it out.

 True,  but considering the capital available in the US, a missed opportunity for ergo.  Goes back to on/off ramp.  Ergo is a highway and a ramp is missing for the greatest playground on earth


[09/20/2022 1:04 PM] blackinsecure#3693
I mean, it's not like people don't want to list


[09/20/2022 1:05 PM] blackinsecure#3693
but you can't put a gun to the CEXs heads


[09/20/2022 1:07 PM] blackinsecure#3693
US CEXs have been slower to include new tokens / coins since they're being investigating by the SEC for listing tokens that were clearly securities

 Use the ergo ecosystem.
Share with your friends and family all the cool things you can do in it.
More users and activity will attract more devs and projects. Which will fill blocks and the chain will flourish!

I dont know if this is allowed, admins feel free to remove my message if you feel this is not acceptable.

I'm a developer and finding hard times lately with all the crash so if anyone wants a bot for telegram to monitor your rigs or whatever else that has an API (I've been thinking about coin price alerts, network hashrate/difficulty alerts, blocks found by pool or by yourself in case you're solo mining) please contact me and we can see your needs and negotiate a price. Hosting would be included as I have a server for other needs :)

Block times are irrelevant for miners, the only thing that affects your yield is diff

[09/20/2022 5:52 PM] Nick#0000
(re @Xhariel : *Block times are irrelevant for miners, the only thing that affects your yield is diff*) 
 
 higher block times means less total emissions for the day so the yield goes down


[09/20/2022 5:53 PM] Xhariel#0000
For you, that's what difficulty means


[09/20/2022 5:53 PM] Xhariel#0000
Higher block times means there is less miners than there should be


[09/20/2022 5:53 PM] Xhariel#0000
So, there is less emissions, yes, but there is less miners too.


[09/20/2022 5:54 PM] Xhariel#0000
The problem is not block times, the problem is difficulty


[09/20/2022 5:54 PM] Xhariel#0000
And when block times are lower, it still does not matter


[09/20/2022 5:54 PM] Xhariel#0000
Cause yes, there is more emission but there are more miners


[09/20/2022 5:54 PM] Nick#0000
True true, it's just frustrating the difficulty adjustments takes so long to change.


[09/20/2022 5:54 PM] Xhariel#0000
so those emissions are getting diluted


[09/20/2022 5:55 PM] Xhariel#0000
At the end of the day, what you need to pay attention to is the difficulty. And yes, I've been talking about this being a problem way before the ETH merge :)


[09/20/2022 5:55 PM] Nick#0000

It’s probably been asked for and already in the works, but one feature I value on other pools (eg flexpool, flypool) is a 24hr graph of individual miner hashrate.

(re @Arohbe : *You mean like this but with sorting by worker?*) 
 
 Oh i see - it is there just slightly hidden!… perhaps when you change to the personal tab , the graph on the main screen can change from Pool hashrate to individual hashrate?

 Sorting by worker would be bonus but not essential imo

[09/21/2022 4:31 AM] K#0000
(re @d3lta19 : *This has been sitting like this for 6 days. Multiple blocks found since then*) 
 
 Likely because you have not been included in the latest blocks (did you shut off your miner?), which is required for payout. 

I am actually working on this as we speak, so that inclusion into blocks is not necessary to get your payout out of the contract.

 This is no longer the case, all pools pay block-by-block again due to the integration of plasma

I did shut off my miner. Didn't realize that was required for payout. How long do I have to mine to pool to initiate payout?

(re @d3lta19 : *I did shut off my miner. Didn't realize that was required for payout. How long do I have to mine to pool to initiate payout?*) 
 
 Enough to get 0.001 ERG at the very least. Though like I said, I am working on it so that you won't have to do this anymore. Aiming to get that update out later this week.

 No issues other than no blocks found on that pool for quite some time due to the difficulty increase.  You may be better switching to our default pool for right now since it has the most hashrate.

 I believe you are working with allcloudy on this as it does not relate to the pool.  I also do not think everything was validated yet.  Best to check with him in discord.  He is usually free later in the evenings.

 Victor, look at your portal for your wallet. Difficulty has gone up which means less blocks found.

 Depends on which pool you’re on but very slow blocks for everyone right now with the high difficulty.


[09/21/2022 8:58 PM] Tom666#0000
If I tried with any value less then 0.5 erg I get an error msg that min 0.1 is the minimum, even when I try with 0.4. With 0.5 it updates to 1,000 neta, even though it says that 1,000 neta is 1 erg

[09/22/2022 4:50 PM] K#0000
Nah, hardfork requires 90% miner consensus so quite unlikely. What will probably happen is that everyone running nodes will have to update if the HF is decided

Is there any talk of increasing asic resistance while adjusting diff algorithm in the process?

Have not heard of that but sounds like a good idea


[09/22/2022 4:56 PM] K#0000
There is an ergo forum post called the HF wishlist, to add things to the potential HF outside of just diff retargeting. Might be good to post there.

(re @K : *Nah, hardfork requires 90% miner consensus so quite unlikely. What will probably happen is that everyone running nodes will have to update if the HF is decided*) 
 
 And since we saw around 200TH/S those miners could come back on to have the major vote on keeping the diff the same so they can keep just popping on to ergo when diff is low reduce the times for blocks get more reward than fuck off when diff goes up and wait for us to mine the now 9.5 minute blocks until its time to repeat the cyclw

 Pretty unlikely actually, as the problem would solve itself in that case. A vote passing simply requires one epoch with > 90% of the vote to succeed. If large miners wish to continuously stop the vote from going, then they must continually mine to the chain. And if they're continuously mining to the chain, then the problem is solved.


[09/22/2022 11:00 PM] K#0000
If they leave when the diff goes high again, then the remaining miners will control the vote and fix the diff issue.


[09/22/2022 11:03 PM] Alex#0000
Oh and by miners other than getblok we mean pools for voting


[09/22/2022 11:04 PM] K#0000
So in that sense, a fix to the diff problem is inevitable. Either miners will leave and loyal miners will vote to fix it, or bad actors will inadvertantly fix the problem themselves by mining to the chain for multiple epochs.


[09/22/2022 11:06 PM] K#0000
(re @Alex : *Oh and by miners other than getblok we mean pools for voting*) 
 
 Pools aren't really the issue here, because pools have an incentive for a good diff algo as it gets them more profits. They have infrastructure supporting the chain regardless of the diff, so its in their best interest to fix the diff algo rather than having peaks and valleys.


[09/22/2022 11:12 PM] Alex#0000
Or bad miners will turn on to vote time will tell


[09/22/2022 11:13 PM] K#0000
(re @Alex : *Or bad miners will turn on to vote time will tell*) 
 
 That's the great part. If they turn on to vote, they have to turn on for multiple epochs. And if they're on for multiple epochs, then the problem is solved.


[09/22/2022 11:14 PM] Alex#0000
Not really, they can turn on vote against it then turn off lol


[09/22/2022 11:15 PM] K#0000
Votes run for multiple epochs. You only need one epoch with > 90% to pass. So if they turn off when the diff goes high, all the loyal miners will be > 90% and will vote in the diff fix.


[09/22/2022 11:15 PM] K#0000
Votes run for multiple epochs (Usually 10 - 20 if I remember correctly). You only need one epoch with > 90% to pass. So if they turn off when the diff goes high, all the loyal miners will be > 90% and will vote in the diff fix.


[09/22/2022 11:16 PM] K#0000
If after 20 epochs the vote doesn't pass, then it can quite literally just be submitted again until it does pass.

As hashrate turns off or moves away from Ergo, block times increase thus extending an epoch.

To assist short-term, point hash rate towards Ergo to help reduce adjustment time

Something weird I noticed with my miner on 4 different rigs. Every 24-25 mins, the connection to the pool gets reset and upon miner reconnect the block height becomes 843386. Until a block is found then it advances to the current block height.


[09/23/2022 12:38 PM] Antonis#0000
@Arohbe if you please can check whether it’s a pool issue 🙏🏼

Right now all my rigs are reconnecting to the pool and the block height is correct (843463)

 Hashrate is really a measurement of difficulty.  So the number shows is just reflecting a miscalculation since the difficulty is so high.

 I think you can pull the API without one.

I made a suggestion to Aneta's admin to give NETA bonuses to the angel gamblers in the pool, by drawing every season of Ergo. This could attract miners and help with the transition from post merge difficulty to a definitive solution by the developers.

[09/25/2022 8:53 PM] Antonis#0000
Network hashrate is derived from network difficulty and avg block time. Since the difficulty dropped, it’s natural that the network hashrate shows as having dropped as well. Not saying that it didn’t drop, just saying that it’s not accurate at this point.


[09/25/2022 9:24 PM] Xhariel#0000
That makes sense


[09/25/2022 9:27 PM] Xhariel#0000

That's a bug

(re @Alex : *Has to show erg is profitable to mine on whattomine otherwise noone comes you saw them flock to kaspa*) 
 
 Nothing is profitable right now...
People are spec mining the coins they think will succeed.

Many have turned rigs off.

Eventually an equilibrium will be found. And right now, in a bear market, that will probably a price which just about covers the lowest kWh price. (a few cents....)

I have a Radeon RX Vega 56 card that stopped mining. When I ask Hive for info about it, it says Malfunction. Any idea how to further explore its condition, or try to fix it?


[09/26/2022 12:52 PM] cannon#3541
It is not all running negative. Profit depends on infrastructure - gpu model, oc settings, electricity and room/facility. If you're $0.12 and below there are positive options if you have proper infrastructure.

 Unless you got latest generation cards AND you run them at the absolute lowest watts (max efficiency) oc settings, even 0.11$ per kWh is not profitable. Meaning, you are better off buying any given coin directly -with the money saved from electricity- instead of buying it.


[09/26/2022 7:04 PM] ÅrÖhBê#8289

 You can just lower your threshold (e.g., to 0.1 erg) and get paid

(re @Alex : *If no one mines you can't buy them*) 
 
 You are buying tokens that have been mined long time ago. Also, there’s always someone that will be mining. As the less people mining the more profitable it becomes. So, buying instead of mining at the moment is good for two things: A) helping maintain (or even rise) the price of the coin and B) making it more profitable for the (remaining) miners. 😉

So how do we stand on the matter? With no time to do it properly, I guess there’s no way to have a fair vote.
At first I was hoping that we could spin up a poll on the site; one wallet currently running on getblok = one vote. Share on socials etc
But that might be infeasible

 Barely enough time to think it over, hopefully the plan is not too rushed and the eip is worth the fork. Would be nice to have some other key ideas  since its a hard fork oh well putting my trust in the devs and getblok

(re @Alex : *If no one is mining that coin the transaction will not be verified and you will not get your coin*) 
 
 Buying on CEX’s (Coinbase, cryptodotcom) doesn’t work like that. There’s no transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain (until you need to withdraw your coins to your non-custodial wallet obviously). But, really, what are we discussing here? If no1 is mining a PoW project then that project is dead, so what would someone want to buy? I already said that the possibility of no1 being left to mine is close to zero, because mining works like that, the less people mining the more profitable it becomes for the rest, so they simply don’t stop mining.


[09/28/2022 5:49 AM] Antonis#0000
(re @allcloudy : *Odd ball, fluctuation i suppose*) 
 
 It “glitched”, if you see the fan is reporting 0%. It’s a well-known error in hiveos since the early 3060 LHR days. When a card crashes while mining it goes into “glitch-mode”, with fans reporting 0% and obviously not mining fully. A reboot is required. 👍🏼

(re @Shiny_Umbreon : *For some reason my 3060ti’s like -300 core and my 3070’s like -500. Both with set pl. locked cc gives me worse efficiency on all cards except my 3060’s*)

Just be careful putting trust in that a cex will give you those coins since you dont own the keys to them. Example Celsius

 Ok trex here too. Core -300 / Mem 3800 / PL 103 (trex reads 102w) - obviously it’s a silicon lottery Hynix 3060 Ti (samsungs can’t clock that high). So I guess 1.52 is a new record? 😎

 I have a v2 Hynix that can clock to 3800 but it doesn’t get anywhere near 1.52 lol
I’m getting 1.32 best

Hehe yeah v1 Hynix suck (at least in mem intensive algos like eth or ergo). But they are equally good (or sometimes better) in other algos. So don’t just ditch them right away if you happen to come across one.

 Under no circumstance is this an option unless you want 2miners to effectively be able to perform a 51% attack.

 Yes I agree. I thought about directing my mining farms there to help with the voting process, as the first 'no' popped up due to the node not updating. I'll wait a little longer.

Have you guys ever dropped your memclock and gotten bigger hashrate?


[09/30/2022 3:06 AM] Shiny_Umbreon#0000
I’m hardcore power limiting my cards for efficiency and I’m finding that dropping mem clock increases my cards hashrate when drastically reducing PL


[09/30/2022 3:08 AM] elazor#0115
Nice what mem are you using


[09/30/2022 3:09 AM] Shiny_Umbreon#0000
Both my 3060tis and 3070’s


[09/30/2022 3:09 AM] Shiny_Umbreon#0000
I usually do -500 core 2600 mem at 120pl for my 3070’s


[09/30/2022 3:10 AM] Shiny_Umbreon#0000
But I’m powerlimiting to 110 and setting mem to 1800 is gaining more hashrate rather than leaving the mem at 2600 with the pl of 110


[09/30/2022 3:11 AM] Shiny_Umbreon#0000
Of course I get less hasrate if the pl is higher with mem 1800


[09/30/2022 3:11 AM] Shiny_Umbreon#0000
It’s like when you lower pl you need to lower mem as well

[09/30/2022 6:34 AM] Antonis#0000
(re @Shiny_Umbreon : *It’s like when you lower pl you need to lower mem as well*) 
 
 Makes sense, because with lower mem clocks you got less needs for power so less “competition” between core and mem, since the power limit is very low.

(re @Antonis : *Makes sense, because with lower mem clocks you got less needs for power so less “competition” between core and mem, since the power limit is very low.*) 
 
 It surprises me because with ethash you always just crank up the memory and it will yield higher hash. I think it’s probably because ergo has some core aspect to it in comparison to ethash


[09/30/2022 7:17 AM] Antonis#0000
(re @Shiny_Umbreon : *It surprises me because with ethash you always just crank up the memory and it will yield higher hash. I think it’s probably because ergo has some core aspect to it in comparison to ethash*) 
 
 Yes. With a PL set so low, with mem clocked really high, there’s not so much power left for core, so the underclock is such that it impacts hashrate. As you said, ergo is different than eth in that aspect, it needs a bit of core in order to support the mem controller.

 Why not just make 2 pools with different nodes. If people want yes, then they join the yes pool, if they want no, then they join the no pool. Of course this will limit payouts to only 1 pool, but it will allow the network to hardfork more quickly once the threshold is met. Obstaining- or being neutral now is the equivalent of a 'No' vote on the blockchain. See block 844332.

It will also limit votes.  We need block finds to vote. 

We’re not going to change our process.  We built it around the first announcement of the voting window and now we are going to stick to it.

Ok, but why would miners- who mostly want to hardfork asap- direct hash power to a network voting no on the chain? I be moving. Thanks for the innovation- sucks you can't admit to a mistake where hardforks are concerned.

 We made no mistake.  We built based on the original announcement of when the voting process would start.  We are leaving the votes to the miners which is the way it’s supposed to be.   Sorry we are doing things the right way.  Our code is built and there is no going back. We are not voting no.  We are allowing true governance over our pools decision.

 I mean no disrespect, but mayhaps a more efficient method of voting hardforks could be evaluated and put in place for future use. It is the time sensitive nature of this vote that lends to my view of Getbloks voting style as inefficient- you are right, you made no mistake, you just didn't find -imo- the best solution.

 None taken but let’s be clear.  If the voting starting window didn’t change yesterday this would not be an issue.  The solution is fine.  The software is built to ensure we vote properly and vote within a certain time period.  If the rules are changed after the fact unfortunately nothing we can do. 

Granted this is an EIP for a hard fork but picture any election that has a set election date and then the date was moved up by two weeks.  In that scenario would we blame the poll houses and the voters for not being ready?

 I get your point, and normally this would be a non-issue, but adaptability is supposed to be one of the advantages that DeFi is trying to emulate. Sometimes that means changing tracks. In this instance, why would we have polling booths if we can just go out in the parking lot and ask all those who vote yes to stand on one side and those who vote no on the other side, and let the scales decide? The inefficiency is in the bureaucratic nature of the vote when there is an inherent one built into the hardfork mechanism. I get that it's set up this way for now, maybe approaching it differently in the future will allow for a more agile footing should things change quickly.


[09/30/2022 2:04 PM] Kenial#0000
All of this aside, the pool is voting no until the vote comes in for the tickets on the chain. There is no neutrality on the blockchain. This is the point I'm trying to make.

 Keep in mind.  The current voting process is not very democratic.   It leaves the decision in the hands of the pool operators.  Granted one can choose their pool accordingly but we built Proof of Vote to be the most democratic approach for the governance process on ergo.  Possibly this EIP it may not be as impactful but if this was an EIP with strong opposition then possibly it will apply.   Here is another way to look at it.  What if ALL the pools votes yes but none of the miners agree.   Do miners now have a fair say?   They are forced to decide to mine ergo or not and that’s not how the governance model should work if changes in the protocol are to be decided by the miners (not the pool operators). Sure that’s an extreme scenario but still possible.


[09/30/2022 2:25 PM] Kenial#0000
I agree completely, your approach is better than the others in that it gives a choice. However in this instance that choice is delayed and defaults to No in real time. I get that things changed last minute, but as it stands Getblok is likely to be one of the only pools that will have voted no on chain for most of this hardfork. Sure there are nuances, but the chain is absolute, and you can't go back. You could have provided the same functionality, just by giving 2 pools instead of Proof of Vote once things did change. The option to vote is still there for anyone who does not want the EIP, but your stance on chain is also represented accurately on chain. History will only show that for the majority of the hardfork voting process Getblok voted No. The nuanced part doesn't get recorded for all time, just the vote. So even if almost all people in the pool want to vote yes, they may not even get the chance to have their voice heard and they have to accept that the pool is voting No until the internal PoV process reveals the pools stance.

 i suspect that the people that care about this will already know about the nuance and remeber what geblok did with it's truely democratic approach to the matter.

It's a non issue practically, but on principle it should matter, especially considering the pool's stance on governance.

(re @dadreboi : *i suspect that the people that care about this will already know about the nuance and remeber what geblok did with it's truely democratic approach to the matter.*) 
 
 I would challenge that. Democratic would only apply if the default wasn't No. By the time the pool gets to Yes on chain, it may already be over, so how does that democratically represent the miners in this pool?

[09/30/2022 2:31 PM] Arohbe#0000
Also from a development standpoint.  What you propose with two pools kind of defeats the purposes.  We would be diluted to minority and our vote wouldn’t count either.   Also the development time required would push us way past the voting period.


[09/30/2022 2:31 PM] Kenial#0000
I understand, but that doesn't change the reality on chain.

 They don't have to be 2 nodes really. You could just update the node to reflect the sub pool with the most hashrate, which you can easily find. This also has its issues, but at least the miners vote on chain would be more representative.


[09/30/2022 2:34 PM] Kenial#0000
It's done for now. As you said, there is no time to develop a new system. But we can learn and move forward. 😊


[09/30/2022 2:35 PM] Kenial#0000
At least your pool is trying to do right by miners in the fundamentals.

 Still that takes development and complete refactoring of the subpool code.  Nevertheless the voting process will be fine.  We will start voting today and be finished by Saturday.  Honestly I think future efforts should be around more organization of the EIP itself to ensure everyone can adapt appropriately.  It seems easy from afar but development takes time and money.

 Agreed. But this would have to be a community driven effort. All the tools we need are already built into the framework. It just needs to be leveraged. Unfortunately, there is money to be had by building out those tools, and so they are not a focus. Thank you for your efforts in this regard, this pool system is revolutionizing and my intent is not to disparage it - only to suggest avenues of amelioration.

 Too much time spent crying when essentially there’s zero practical value in what you say. You proposed two pools, as if you know for sure this is easier to implement. Also, have you thought what would happen in this scenario? With the current pool hashrate and the block times, the already low hashrate would be split even further. Practically the pool might have found zero blocks. So again, it wouldn’t count towards your “yes-goal” anyway. And what about the miners? Where would the pool put them by default? In the “yes” or the “no” pool? Problem again. So you see it’s easy to throw farts in the wind when there’s no actual thought behind it. Getblok done nothing wrong. And it’s definitely not their fault for the current ergo situation. Quit crying and start mining 🦾

No contract will not display until a token is submitted.  

Also keep in mind there may be some delays due to unconfirmed transactions.  As mentioned by @Gazza_SP there are a ton of small tx in the mempool and slow blocks. By adding a little extra fee greater than .001 ERG it will help your tx become prioritized.

If all the GBGT left voted no, would the yes still win?

In other words, are there enough votes left to change the results?

Good question. Would be cool if voting ended once 51% of votes logged for in yes or no wallets

(re  : *<elazor> Good question. Would be cool if voting ended once 51% of votes logged for in yes or no wallets*) 
 
 We considered this.   If there is no possible way for a “no” vote due to majority of the tokens being “yes” then we can vote yes and still meet contract rules.


[10/01/2022 5:08 AM] Arohbe#0000
The UI needs an update it’s showing in NanoGBGT lmao


[10/01/2022 5:10 AM] blackinsecure#3693
but are there any no votes at all?


[10/01/2022 5:10 AM] blackinsecure#3693
and also, why 51% and not 50% + 1?

34.4 Yes votes, 0.4 No Votes


[10/01/2022 5:15 AM] K#0000
1200 distributed in total


[10/01/2022 6:24 AM] Z7_7_Z#0000
Sorry if this has been discussed before but is there a reason why generic GBGT tokens are distributed vs eip specific?

Let’s say you got GBGT earlier this year but felt indifferent on eip27. If you didn’t send them for a vote, is there anything stopping you from voting “twice” on eip37 with your old eip27 GBGT tokens?

If that IS possible. Can you (GetBlok) just name them “GBGT27”, “GBGT37”, etc as the proposals come out?


[10/01/2022 6:41 AM] GliTch_40#0000
might just be simplicity sake as we will likely have more in the future and will end up with leftover tokens after the vote has ended


[10/01/2022 6:42 AM] GliTch_40#0000
I don't think voting in future proposals would hurt that much but 🤷‍♂️ time will tell there is always someone to game the system


[10/01/2022 6:44 AM] elazor#0115

I saw that, but don’t quite understand it. How many of the total 1200 GBGT have actually voted? If the majority have voted and it’s a clear “yes” (that can’t be changed even if all the rest votes are “no”), perhaps the pool can switch to the “yes” node already?

 That was an oversight meaning anything over 50%.

around a day


[10/01/2022 4:47 PM] odiseus_me#0000
(re  : *<blackinsecure> around a day*) 
 
 Would that be in time for the general vote to pass/happen? Also - if we are over 50% and there is no way we can get below 50% - why not vote now?


[10/01/2022 4:50 PM] Arohbe#0000
50% of the votes so far are in favor but 50% of the tokens for voting have not been used yet.   However as we get closer to the end of voting we will most likely convert our node over.  Voting end block 844625


[10/01/2022 4:51 PM] blackinsecure#3693
there's a small chance the HF is activated before the vote is finished, isn't there?

Due to overwhelming support (>90% Yes) for the hard fork we have decided to begin voting now. If the vote changes prior to block 844625 we will revert back. #EIP37 #Ergo $ERG

Thanks.  Miners can still vote up until that block height before the contract is complete. But I agree I wish the voting window could have been longer.


[10/01/2022 7:42 PM] Antonis#0000
They missed the chance by not actively taking part in the voting system (aka sending the GBGT tokens). They had (and still have) time to vote though, for sure.

Will post what I put in discord:

We followed the details here on setting voting: https://www.ergoforum.org/t/eip-37-hard-fork-voting-and-activation-details/3989/2 
 
For whatever reason, seems like it didn't work. So going to instead update to 4.0.103 (which we would have rather avoided due to PoV being a little harder to deal with there)

Im not sure how 2miners gets their numbers, but if they integrate diff into their calculation then it makes sense that it shows an erroneous hashrate drop


[10/03/2022 8:06 AM] K#0000
Diff dropped by 2x and the hashrate shown also dropped by that amount


[10/03/2022 8:06 AM] Shiny_Umbreon#0000

So are we in a new epoch now?


[10/03/2022 8:09 AM] K#0000
Yep, the fork caused a new epoch which lowered the diff by half.


[10/03/2022 8:10 AM] Shiny_Umbreon#0000
Got it. Is diff adjustment the same? Based on previous 8?

[10/03/2022 6:40 PM] Antonis#0000
(re @Arohbe : *Looking into this.  Yeah if posted and you were mining it will be paid.*) 
 
 I don’t have doubts. Just you need to check UI if something’s wrong or it’s just because blocks are not 100% confirmed yet. I am so used to eth blocks being confirmed faster (hence pool rewards appeared faster) and sometimes ergo blocks and their rewards can be confusing. ☺️


[10/03/2022 6:43 PM] Shiny_Umbreon#0000
Is getblok still 60 blocks to confirm?


[10/03/2022 6:44 PM] Shiny_Umbreon#0000
Also, how does that work with normal pools now (for 720). That means it takes 5.6 epochs for blocks to confirm ?🤣


[10/03/2022 7:00 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @Shiny_Umbreon : *Also, how does that work with normal pools now (for 720). That means it takes 5.6 epochs for blocks to confirm ?🤣*) 
 
 Normal block confirmations on Ergo are 720 confirmations.  So if you were to host your own pool and mine solo that is the starting point.   Many pools add ERG to their pool wallets and shorten the confirmation timing in the code written for the stratum server.  This is basically the pool fronting the money to miners before the block is paid out.   36-72 confirmations is standard for many pools.  We are at 20, but we also have smart contract processing which sends transactions into the mempool to be processed by other blocks.   Once the tx is processed then our payments are issued.   So timing on the smart contract side is hit or miss.  It could be 40 min it could be hours depending on tx traffic in the mempool and block times.


[10/03/2022 7:29 PM] Shiny_Umbreon#0000
Some pools still take 720 blocks, so that means with the soft fork, we are looking at 5.6 epochs to complete for confirmation?


[10/03/2022 7:29 PM] Shiny_Umbreon#0000
and getblok is 20 confirmations, not 60?

Will this be similar to parallel assets on flux, or structured more like the current ergo pad / neta?

(re @Alex : *Anyone know the formula to figure out how many BTU you have if you know the cubic volume of the room with its temperature's rate of rise from the miners? (If that question made sense)*) 
 
 Just multiply the amount of watts you are consuming by 3.41

Multiply the watts by pi eh

There’s a math too for how many tons of ac cooling you need per BTU

Everybody want the slice of erg

4000~ worker is listed and each worker hash around 2,5gh
So total would be like 10Ths …
They are big player..
I guess 3080ti x 40000 
Its 32million usd if 3080ti 800usd each… 
Huge investment ☠️

How does this pools work, when do we get Ergo and when token (Neta, Comet etc.). Sorry for a nooby question, I can't find logic in my payouts

(re @KnBal_aka_Dilema : *How does this pools work, when do we get Ergo and when token (Neta, Comet etc.). Sorry for a nooby question, I can't find logic in my payouts*) 
 
 What subpool are you on? If you mine Neta you only get paid out in Neta. Ergopad is Erg + Ergopad and same thing with Comet. The tokens are paid out with the Erg when the block is confirmed, processed, and then paid out


[10/04/2022 1:41 PM] KnBal_aka_Dilema#0000
I've just set getblock in hive


[10/04/2022 1:41 PM] Nick#0000
You can use the tokens to participate in Defi like staking with the projects or adding liquidity for additional yield on top of your mining rewards


[10/04/2022 1:42 PM] Nick#0000
(re @KnBal_aka_Dilema : *I've just set getblock in hive*) 
 
 It puts you on the default pool which is Erg only. You can go to settings and change your subpool from there

 Right but would evga do their own pcb or just rebrand it


[10/05/2022 1:09 AM] elazor#0115
All the aibs use nvidia / amd Pcbs , they just add cooling. That is my understanding at least. I imagine the same will be done with intel


[10/05/2022 1:10 AM] Nick#0000
There used to be more odd stuff coming out of AIB but amd/nvidia limited what they could do


[10/05/2022 1:11 AM] allcloudy#0000
May be that the evga break up will spur up some innovation. Hope intel supports it

@admin Gents been running on Plasma pool for a while but have received zero payout, Tried a different wallet, same. Now I am on Ergopad sub pool with 9G. Still no payouts. Am I doing something wrong? I also had this issue on Ergominers.com. Shares never confirm, just stays pending. Would also like to propose a change. It would be nice if one could see when the shares confirm. Like on 2Miners. That feature alone makes me go back to them. I am all for supporting smaller pools and decentralization but we're running blind on Getblock.io


[10/05/2022 8:13 AM] Xhariel#0000
Ergopad has only 150gh of HR, it takes long to find blocks. You can check all blocks found here https://ergo.getblok.io/blocks and filter by pool


[10/05/2022 8:56 AM] BATMAN#0000
(re @Xhariel : *Ergopad has only 150gh of HR, it takes long to find blocks. You can check all blocks found here https://ergo.getblok.io/blocks and filter by pool*) 
 
 I agree,  it's  sucks, it don't function as it should,  then ya ergopad will disappear, 
Just expressing my own experience, to many problems, = high risk,
I suggest  Forget about all that staking  nonsense ,  just go straight mining,  no headache then your in control of your own assets, 
Not you keys not your ergopad


[10/05/2022 9:11 AM] Xhariel#0000
It functions exactly as expected. If you want more blocks, more reliability, go and throw more HR at the subpool or go a do a campaign to get it. The thing is, it will even out in the long run. Your attitude proves you're just here seeking profits and dont care about the project at all, you just want those juicy dollars.

Recently I've seen many people complaining and they barely understands the basics of mining and blockchain, I'm no expert by any means but you need to do one of two things: drop the bitchy attitude or go learn the basics and bring up a legit complaint. Ideally do both.


[10/05/2022 9:14 AM] Xhariel#0000
Y'all just sound like you want to get everything given  to you on a silver platter and want to do 0 effort to understand what's behind it.


[10/05/2022 9:15 AM] Xhariel#0000
Anyway, rant off, I admire how the team at Getblok have so much patience to deal with all the incoming requests, I just lost mine here. Kudos there guys

(re @Xhariel : *Ergopad has only 150gh of HR, it takes long to find blocks. You can check all blocks found here https://ergo.getblok.io/blocks and filter by pool*) 
 
 So i might aswell attempt solo at this point?


[10/05/2022 12:29 PM] Xhariel#0000
Yes and no


[10/05/2022 12:29 PM] Xhariel#0000
If you go solo, you lose the benefits of ergopad


[10/05/2022 12:30 PM] Xhariel#0000
If you stick to the pool, when you eventually hit a block, you will get a huge payout


[10/05/2022 12:30 PM] Xhariel#0000
If you are 9 out of 150GH


[10/05/2022 12:30 PM] Xhariel#0000
You will get 2.88 ERG aprox


[10/05/2022 12:33 PM] Xhariel#0000
Also, if you go solo, you will hit 48ERG but you will take 20 times as long 🤷


[10/05/2022 12:33 PM] Xhariel#0000
That's just how blockchain works


[10/05/2022 12:33 PM] Xhariel#0000
Nothing new for ergo or getblok


[10/05/2022 12:34 PM] Xhariel#0000
Also, keep in mind that your rewards will be reduced if you pool hop


[10/05/2022 12:34 PM] Xhariel#0000
Since the payout scheme is PPLNS


[10/05/2022 12:34 PM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @Xhariel : *You will get 2.88 ERG aprox*) 
 
 But it also depends on the hash you contribute - so if a block is found (even by you) only minutes after you joined, you will get very little

[10/05/2022 2:53 PM] Arohbe#0000
Correct payments are a bit different on our pool because they run through smart contracts to store certain data on chain.  But the unconfirmed balance is basically an estimate of the block reward before it’s paid.  It’s based on your shares submitted and gets updated once the block is marked “pre-processed.”

 I was a little unclear on some of the interviews about asic resistance. I don't think asics will be good for long term


[10/05/2022 5:49 PM] Xhariel#0000
There is a problem with the ASIC stuff


[10/05/2022 5:51 PM] Xhariel#0000
By the time we realize they are active and hashing away, it will be too late to stop them. 
An algo change would require a hardfork and by the time they are making trouble ASICs would control more than 10% of the network, so good by to the 90% governance.

 probably, unless it would be voted on now that the current community agrees staying gpu focused. Asic only projects don't get nearly as much traction and I don't think it really fits in with the ethos of decentralization as much as GPUS. I like the fact that a dude with a gaming pc and one gpu can participate in the network

It only takes less than 10th to stop the vote. Someone with money can eat the losses to control the vote for asics

 You will be rewarded accordingly for the number of shares you submitted WHEN a block is found. If you want to get paid according to your hashrate -whether the pool finds a block or not- you should choose a PPS pool.

 I think it’s a 50/50 shot rn. I’ve heard some interviews on YouTube and they denied having an nvidia contract that prevents them from making other brand GPU’s. The guy interviewing laughed and said the nvidia ceo would never sign something like that. Also, I know intel this week has met with evga. Now, we don’t know regarding what (could be for new raptor lake motherboard specs) but it wouldn’t be a shot in right field for them to ask about GPU’s

What happened to NETA smartpool? Since 30 of september no new blocks found. I have unconfirmed balance pending since then.

(re @Raul : *What happened to NETA smartpool? Since 30 of september no new blocks found. I have unconfirmed balance pending since then.*) 
 
 well it was in a slump w/ low hashrate like the other pools with long block times


[10/06/2022 2:13 AM] GliTch_40#0000
even now it's lower hashrate which means it's less likely to hit blocks


[10/06/2022 2:14 AM] GliTch_40#0000
But it should be hitting blocks again soon ™️

 The next block was found 6 hours ago, my balance is still in confirmed state. I know the pool is not finding too many blocks, but how long it takes for payment to be made after a block?

 It should pay right after it’s marked paid.  Are you currently mining?  If not that’s the issue.


[10/06/2022 8:12 PM] Tom666#0000
No, I'm not mining anymore. I don't think this should be a problem, even if it is

 You do need to be mining in order to change settings.  The back end requires confirmation that you’re connected in order to change.

 That's likely the source of the issue then. Though we are working on a way to force old balances out after a block or two of not mining. So if you don't feel like mining again, your balance should be sent to you once that update is out.

(re @Shiny_Umbreon : *Rigs are turned off until I get my solar panels installed*) 
 
 If you have a balance your need to mine to get .001 erg.  Once you do the balance will push out.  Otherwise we will have a fix in about a week or so that forces balances out after a few blocks of miners not being on the pool.


[10/08/2022 9:21 PM] Shiny_Umbreon#0000
So it won’t confirm the balance unless I’m mining ?


[10/08/2022 9:22 PM] Shiny_Umbreon#0000
Because with my unconfirmed I would have hit my minimum to withdraw

 Lower your min payout to 1 and mine for a bit and the confirmed will push out.  The .263 is probably as Kirat explained.

 A getblok only vote would be good for promotion and decentralizing hashrate. Plus the ones who have strong opinions on it will definitely move over to cast their vote


[10/09/2022 2:51 AM] GliTch_40#0000
Best not get involved if the community wants it they can establish lines of communication organize a full vote with options to move forward at that point others could get involved otherwise its just barking into open space


[10/09/2022 3:08 AM] Nick#0000
True true, I just don't think an accurate vote would be had if large pools or solo miners are voting because there is no incentive to do so. It would be cool of PoV could be implemented network wide so the individuals are voting instead of the pool operators/large solo farms


[10/09/2022 3:18 AM] GliTch_40#0000
Not even that you could distribute a token to wallets that were active in x days with x balance

[10/13/2022 5:30 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @Nick : *Are you able to subscribe to pool specific? I dont want to get my hopes up and have it be another pool haha*) 
 
 The bots both ours and ErgoPort will show all pools.  ErgoPorts bot is faster than ours since our bot posts when the block is confirmed.


[10/13/2022 5:44 PM] dadreboi#0000
(re @rubenserg : *ergoport is sacam?*) 
 
 you gonna make me cry, no scam here ;)


[10/13/2022 5:48 PM] dadreboi#0000
@Arohbe is correct @rubenserg . my bot (ergoport) reads the direct API and notifies of EVERY change each block makes...such as NEW BLOCK FOUND, and then it notifies every time the status changes for example: confirmed, processing, paid, etc....


[10/13/2022 5:48 PM] dadreboi#0000
if you are waiting for a block to be paid you can look for the number at the top of my bot


[10/13/2022 5:49 PM] dadreboi#0000
when a new block is found, then just wait for the notification when that same ID number goes to paid.


[10/13/2022 5:50 PM] dadreboi#0000
I've been considering allowing people to be tagged in the paid and new block notifications, still thinking it over

 No additional bonuses but can be very helpful for AMD miners since AMD GPUs are not as efficient on flux versus NV

All done through GetBlok.  You will be getting Flux-Erg tokens which can be exchanged on zelcore and spectrum.

 Nautilus will still work but you will need zelcore to swap with tokens on that side.

[10/14/2022 8:10 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @Nick : *Better to use Zelcore for the flux pool then?*) 
 
 It’s your call. Flux is also on Spectrum but the liquidity pool is still small.  But could be some benefit to swap their potentially.


[10/14/2022 8:53 PM] Nick#0000
(re @Arohbe : *It’s your call. Flux is also on Spectrum but the liquidity pool is still small.  But could be some benefit to swap their potentially.*) 
 
 I saw that, I'm not sure how the APR works. I was providing liquidity for Neta and Ergopad  but it made more sense to stake. The amounts would fluctuate so it was hard to gauge what was increasing. For the Flux/Erg liquidity pool are both assets supposed to grow at the variable rate or is it just the exchange one?


[10/14/2022 8:53 PM] Nick#0000
I would definitely add to the liquidity; it will be good for both projects


[10/14/2022 9:00 PM] Nick#0000
For taxes it makes it more difficult to track too


[10/14/2022 9:25 PM] Arohbe#0000
Correct also with LP there is risk of impermanent loss since it’s based on both assets in the pool.  I meant depending on the size of the liquidity in the pool the value of the token can be different than that on zelcore.


[10/15/2022 12:06 AM] Nick#0000
(re @Arohbe : *Correct also with LP there is risk of impermanent loss since it’s based on both assets in the pool.  I meant depending on the size of the liquidity in the pool the value of the token can be different than that on zelcore.*) 
 
 Ah, I' understand. It will be a really good thing with the add liquidity and volume for Ergo


[10/15/2022 12:12 AM] Nick#0000
On miningpoolstats it might be worth testing out something like "ERGO + Flux + ErgoPad + Comet + Bonus Rewards." I think it would help on attracting new miners as some miners not know what a smartpool is but they will definitely understand mining Flux and Erg at the same time


[10/15/2022 2:18 AM] Ligs20#0000

(re @Arohbe : *It’s your call. Flux is also on Spectrum but the liquidity pool is still small.  But could be some benefit to swap their potentially.*) 
 
 When the unconfirmed balance can be fixed？

In the update we pushed yesterday it now forces out all of the balances (below Min payout) you had on other pools.  For example.  If you leave a small balance on Neta pool and move to default it will push out the balance on the Neta pool.

 This is a nice feature. Any ETA on the UI update?

(re @atom7ktm : *This is a nice feature. Any ETA on the UI update?*) 
 
 Should be today.   We have a few new improvements in there as well.  We’re also working on a full update we are calling v3.  That’s out at least a month though.

 My rig has been up over 24hrs no issues.


[10/15/2022 9:19 PM] atom7ktm#0000
Ok I was curious because the cards mining kaspa on another pool didn’t disconnect. But I am mining at ergo-euwest. Maybe it was the specific node having issues? 🤔

(re @atom7ktm : *Ok I was curious because the cards mining kaspa on another pool didn’t disconnect. But I am mining at ergo-euwest. Maybe it was the specific node having issues? 🤔*) 
 
 Hmm don’t think so.  I would use the global point anyways. Will always redirect you


[10/15/2022 9:41 PM] atom7ktm#0000
(re @Arohbe : *Hmm don’t think so.  I would use the global point anyways. Will always redirect you*) 
 
 I tried it when I first started mining on GetBlok, but I had worse ping for some reason. Maybe it wasn’t redirecting me to euwest, I dunno. So I used euwest in flight sheet.


[10/15/2022 9:42 PM] atom7ktm#0000
But now that you mention it. I should probably add the global point as a secondary (failsafe) pool, after euwest

Is it possible for a group of miners to create a subpool on getblock and mine together and share the rewards equally based on hashrate? Similar to a 'party pool'?

 Oh if you are asking about making a custom subpool I don't think that is active yet so there is no info on the rate yet


[10/16/2022 4:02 AM] GliTch_40#0000
They have been busy with the current subpools and the merge stuff so that information will come later

(re @Alex : *Hows that payout fix coming along, any others have a stuck balance? Anything us miners can do to help?*) 
 
 Yes they are moving slowly. Working on improving the throughput.  Slow because it needs to consolidate boxes which is making it laggy.

So just need erg address because it is a erg token that flux agreed is valued at 1:1 ratio and switch to the new smart pool


[10/17/2022 3:07 AM] Nick#0000
It's closer to 1:3 on Spectrum erg/flux


[10/17/2022 3:10 AM] allcloudy#0000
We're not trading based on spectrum


[10/17/2022 3:11 AM] dadreboi#0000
(re @allcloudy : *We're not trading based on spectrum*) 
 
 so payout will be based on 1:1 ratio and not a live trade of spectrum?


[10/17/2022 3:11 AM] Nick#0000
Is it 1 erg payout is .75 erg and .25 flux?


[10/17/2022 3:11 AM] dadreboi#0000
so getting 1/3 less or am i misunderstanding?


[10/17/2022 3:12 AM] allcloudy#0000
The exchange rate is determine by the Zelcore / Flux team

(re @allcloudy : *The exchange rate is determine by the Flux team*) 
 
 interesting


[10/17/2022 3:12 AM] Alex#0000
Would be like mined 1erg get .75erg and w.e .25erg is in flux value as flux-erg token im guessing


[10/17/2022 3:13 AM] dadreboi#0000
yeah, but the .25 is 1:1 and not 1:3


[10/17/2022 3:13 AM] dadreboi#0000
i might be tired and just not getting it
*edit, ratio is not what I had thought, will know more details at release.


[10/17/2022 3:13 AM] Nick#0000
There is a benefit with mining erg because it's cheaper to run than flux algo


[10/17/2022 3:15 AM] allcloudy#0000
(re @Nick : *There is a benefit with mining erg because it's cheaper to run than flux algo*) 
 
 That was the reason for launching a subpool on Autolykos, cater to a whole host of GPUs that do not do well on flux natively


[10/17/2022 3:15 AM] allcloudy#0000
So will be *very* interesting to see outcome of cards performance and profitability

[10/17/2022 3:19 AM] allcloudy#0000

 And its not arbitrary exchange value. Its based on market exchange rates. We'll be posting more details very soon.


[10/17/2022 3:19 AM] Nick#0000
(re @allcloudy : *So will be *very* interesting to see outcome of cards performance and profitability*) 
 
 It's about 1kw difference for my 28 cards that are running from Flux to Ergo

dang


[10/17/2022 3:22 AM] Nick#0000
I've been wanting a miner to do flux + erg but this way is going to be better because there isn't any extra electricity usage and get to add to the bags of my two favorite projects


[10/17/2022 3:22 AM] allcloudy#0000
Now would be interested on how much you yield in autolykos

because network difficulty still applies

 Which wallet address going to be use?
Ergo-Flux
Flux-Ergo


[10/17/2022 4:31 AM] Arohbe#0000
It will need to be an ergo address


[10/17/2022 4:32 AM] Arohbe#0000
Not an exchange address though. Nautilus, mobile, zelcore will all be OK to use


[10/17/2022 4:33 AM] Madsen#0000
(re @Arohbe : *It will need to be an ergo address*) 
 
 Ergo is 75% , how about another 25% ?
Going to which address?

I would just wait until there is support for the majority of miners unless you use T-rex cause they just updated

hmm so far only good with windows I heard


[10/17/2022 4:37 PM] allcloudy#0000
(re @Nick : *Anybody upgrade to the new nvidia drivers?*) 
 
 I did on my 3060ti and 3080 LHR cards.  Nothing earth shattering, maybe more stable hashrate.

(re @allcloudy : **) 
 
 Have you tried core -300 on your 3060 Ti cards? I am getting better results with that.


[10/17/2022 4:47 PM] allcloudy#0000
(re @atom7ktm : *Have you tried core -300 on your 3060 Ti cards? I am getting better results with that.*) 
 
 what are you getting? lower power? higher power/higher hash?


[10/17/2022 4:47 PM] allcloudy#0000
i tried a few, it has been a trade off of efficiency/hash


[10/17/2022 4:47 PM] allcloudy#0000
that is on NBMiner too. Trying LOL right now with the new driver


[10/17/2022 4:49 PM] atom7ktm#0000
I am getting best results with trex and gminer. Lately I sticked to gminer because it averages out hashrate better after a while (not so many dips due to dag generation after each block)


[10/17/2022 4:50 PM] atom7ktm#0000
(re @allcloudy : *what are you getting? lower power? higher power/higher hash?*) 
 
 With -300 I was able to go a bit lower in PL while not losing hashrate, which means better efficiency of course.


[10/17/2022 4:52 PM] allcloudy#0000
Thanks for feedback, will try it out


[10/17/2022 4:53 PM] allcloudy#0000
Hmm NBM better hash rates on 3080s than LOL. Also tweaked the core/mem a bit and getting into 200s now


[10/17/2022 4:53 PM] atom7ktm#0000
(re @allcloudy : *Thanks for feedback, will try it out*) 
 
 No worries. Let me know how it went 😉
Also try gminer as well


[10/17/2022 4:53 PM] allcloudy#0000
yeah will do


[10/17/2022 4:54 PM] allcloudy#0000
its one of those problems when you have a lot of GPUs, you dont get to tinker to squeeze out as much as you possibly can


[10/17/2022 4:54 PM] allcloudy#0000
you kinda pick a baseline (at the time) and leave it be


[10/17/2022 4:54 PM] allcloudy#0000
then realize months later that you could have gotten more or better efficiency

Yeah I know exactly what you mean. Which is partly the reason I sold all my AMD cards. Less stuff to tinker with. It was nice when I had 5 cards. But with 25 it’s not so much fun anymore! ☺️

 Use 1100/2400, you will lower your power by a lot and gain more stable hashrate

 It should be once shares are seen from your miner. But there is a delay from caching so depending where you are in the world it may take a little time

 looks in the $200-250 range

Which is still pretty expensive for what they are. I don't enough miner's have capitulated or they aren't selling

 Ya no worries man, I'll work with you on the prices if you decide to move forward. The 2070 FE might be a good card to test immersion with, it's a pretty small board/single 8pin

(re @Shiny_Umbreon : *My 3080 is amazing*) 
 
 Ya, they are good cards. Mostly efficient but I just prefer efficiency over density. gddr6 is just easier to deal with and I don't have a full rig of 3080s so I'd rather consolidate and build out for ease of managing

 That would be cool.

(re @Nick : *I have my dad's erg address on Zelcore, the flux-erg will automatically be added when he get's his first payout?*) 
 
 Yeah he should have received payment from the first block.  I also heard if you hold the flux-erg your entitled to their PA snapshot.  Yet to be seen but that would be a nice incentive.


[10/19/2022 1:57 PM] Nick#0000
(re @Arohbe : *Yeah he should have received payment from the first block.  I also heard if you hold the flux-erg your entitled to their PA snapshot.  Yet to be seen but that would be a nice incentive.*) 
 
 I have him mining on Flux right now but I'm going to switch him over so he wasn't in the first block. You have to have a decent amount of Flux to cover fees for the swaps

(re @Arohbe : *I saw 2 flux fee in zelcore to swap up to 500 flux.*) 
 
 Im not sure of the parallel asset swaps. But its 6 flux fee to claim and you get 4% of your total flux held in zelcore, titan, and staked in coinmetro. I think the fee used to be 8


[10/19/2022 3:13 PM] Nick#0000
Deducted from the PA claim


[10/19/2022 4:13 PM] atom7ktm#0000
I was thinking today, isn’t it better to mine flux and get all parallel assets, instead of mining ergo and getting only 25% flux and no parallel assets?


[10/19/2022 4:54 PM] Xhariel#0000
Zelhash is heavier on your GPUs


[10/19/2022 4:55 PM] Xhariel#0000
And takes more power


[10/19/2022 4:55 PM] Xhariel#0000
And you can swap your erg to flux


[10/19/2022 4:56 PM] Xhariel#0000
Hold it on Zelcore and get the PAs for holding Flux


[10/19/2022 5:06 PM] Nick#0000
(re @atom7ktm : *I was thinking today, isn’t it better to mine flux and get all parallel assets, instead of mining ergo and getting only 25% flux and no parallel assets?*) 
 
 Potentially, it's hard to say what is better. The amount of Flux that I got in the first payout was a lot more than what I was expecting. Once the pool grows a little more and consistently finds more blocks it might be equal or slightly higher in yield. 1 K/sol gets you about 3 flux/day + 1.75 pa/fpa per day.


[10/19/2022 5:09 PM] Nick#0000
I've been mining Flux for a while but the flux smart pool might be the way to go with the electricity savings


[10/19/2022 5:27 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @Xhariel : *Hold it on Zelcore and get the PAs for holding Flux*) 
 
 This is correct. If you holding your flux assets in zelcore you will be eligible for their snapshot.  The next one is scheduled to be 8.5%

 You are paid PPLNS for a shared pool. Its not a solo pool, you don't get the full reward.

Who's not on the flux pool and wants to try it out? I'll pay .5flux/g/h on the flux pool for new miners who switch now. I'll verify from the last block for new participation and you have to post your screenshot of your dashboard/wallet for me to verify. Only new miners that switch pools and and not on the last block and have provided screenshots will be paid. You can pm me or post in here the details. Sorry Getblok employees not eligible 😘 Payments will be in the form of Flux-Erg

I didn't use any of the cables that came with it and I wouldn't order one with a PSU


[10/21/2022 1:51 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
I think with psu and mobo is like 200-300$


[10/21/2022 1:51 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
I mean if it gets the job done


[10/21/2022 1:51 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
lol


[10/21/2022 1:52 PM] Nick#0000
It's very cheaply built. Me personally I'd rather have a PSU I can trust


[10/21/2022 1:52 PM] Nick#0000
It's also loud as fuck, you can't adjust the fans


[10/21/2022 1:54 PM] allcloudy#0000

 That’s a cool feature of the octos. Fans are so quiet when not full speed

welp if it gets the job done. It’s all that matters


[10/21/2022 2:43 PM] elazor#0115
I got a decent case with 8 slots with 2400w pay on Amazon for like $600 couple months back. Wanted to try it out before splurging on an octo . So far it’s been solid. Vrteu is the brand


[10/21/2022 2:46 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
so far close case wise, i only paid for 90$ for an auction


[10/21/2022 2:47 PM] meatbeater9000#0000
came with 3300w psu

Main thing to look out for is the PSU and wiring harnesses with most of these PSUs being a couple hundred dollars alone just keep in mind you get what you pay for.

(re  : *<elazor> I would get the octominer if I could get k to prices. Miner dude mark up kinda sucks*) 
 
 I get them direct from octo. Usually order 20 at a time, lowers prices abbot. Agree miner dude is too much

But due to the high gas prices the gov has put a new tax that we don't know


[10/21/2022 4:45 PM] Xhariel#0000
Previous two months that tax was .14

I thought you had 5-10 CTS per kWh there


[10/21/2022 4:54 PM] Nick#0000
In terms of Flux mining it is more profitable. I can't compare on if I was mining 100% ergo but the payouts are good. Plus I'm always trying to get more Flux


[10/21/2022 4:55 PM] Nick#0000

(re @Xhariel : *I thought you had 5-10 CTS per kWh there*) 
 
 Maybe in west Texas, but rest of country it’s all gone up. For example, for GetBlok we had .08 on RENEWABLE energy fixed rate.  Now we are inching .14/kWh.


[10/21/2022 4:55 PM] allcloudy#0000
with threat of it going up 25% more

 Yeah.  I’m in NY close enough to the city for them to justify crazy rates.

Single power authority.  So even if you outsource you still need to pay the local for “supplying” the service.

Solar


[10/21/2022 5:08 PM] allcloudy#0000
Commercial solar, fully installed 20 year warranty permits and all should be $2/w or below.


[10/21/2022 5:08 PM] allcloudy#0000

(re @koutelier : *i was looking on adding solar to the family business. prices has increased like a lot while electricity raised*) 
 
 if you are in US, it’s a good time. Lots of tax incentives and SREC credits are going up on price. Plus you make nice money selling back to grid


[10/21/2022 5:12 PM] allcloudy#0000

[10/21/2022 5:12 PM] koutelier#0000
i am in greece. soon there will be programs from eu for business that will give you like 50-80% back from your investment if you go solar


[10/21/2022 5:13 PM] koutelier#0000

Or how cumbersome or additional money to do the roof at a later date


[10/21/2022 5:16 PM] GliTch_40#0000

(re @Nick : *The roof I'd be putting it on is like 15 yrs old so idk if it would be worth it without replacing the roof*) 
 
 Do it. You can write off extra 60% of roof cost if you do solar.


[10/21/2022 5:17 PM] allcloudy#0000
IRS rule


[10/21/2022 5:17 PM] Xhariel#0000

(re @allcloudy : *Do it. You can write off extra 60% of roof cost if you do solar.*) 
 
 Interesting, I need to get some general pricing. Any others besides Tesla that do solar tiles?


[10/21/2022 5:18 PM] GliTch_40#0000
afaik most tiles are still way over priced compared to the panels

[10/21/2022 5:19 PM] Xhariel#0000
(re @GliTch_40 : *afaik most tiles are still way over priced compared to the panels*) 
 
 But are they overpriced if you factor in the roof replacement price? Like roof+solar is cheaper than solar tiles?

(re @Xhariel : *But are they overpriced if you factor in the roof replacement price? Like roof+solar is cheaper than solar tiles?*) 
 
 typically yes at base price


[10/21/2022 5:21 PM] Xhariel#0000
I see, I just like to be informed. I don't even own the flat I live in let alone a detached house where I can put solar 😂


[10/21/2022 5:21 PM] GliTch_40#0000
also depends on where you are located and how long you want to live there

(re @GliTch_40 : *also depends on where you are located and how long you want to live there*) 
 
 My rigs are so graciously hosted by my parents so it would be their house. Haha, I don't mind paying for the solar but I wouldn't want to pay for the roof replacement

[10/21/2022 5:25 PM] GliTch_40#0000
they have insurance to cover the roof  you cover the solar


[10/21/2022 5:26 PM] Nick#0000

[10/21/2022 5:26 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @allcloudy : *off grid is not “allowed” in PA*) 
 
 Same issue here.  The power co connection surcharge makes it not worth it for many.  Although I haven’t looked at it in years.  Maybe better programs now.


[10/21/2022 5:26 PM] Arohbe#0000
(re @Nick : *Roof + solar maybe looking like 30k?*) 
 
 There’s also the 3rd party route where they cover all the costs but then they reap the benefits of the power not utilized.


[10/21/2022 5:28 PM] GliTch_40#0000
I'd like to find a sucker for that option

 Nah don’t do the solar city deal.  For roof mounted, find a reputable company that will install but you get all the credits

 Yeah it’s a scam imo but many fall for it.  I guess it’s good for an average user who has no capital and wants to save a few bucks.

As for solar, be sure to factor in avg daylight annually per side of your roof.
Solar reps usually try to sell you on the whole thing but frequently one side is marginally better than the other. You can reach your ROI faster if you determine which side is optimal


[10/21/2022 7:55 PM] Shiny_Umbreon#0000

(re @Nick : *Is everyone else finding they are actually in profit on the Flux pool? I have about 5g/h and I'm running at a profit*) 
 
 Well with the block luck and only 80GH in the pool ya the rewards are awesome. Dont care about the profit as im not selling coins right now

And we’ll do this every day, 12 GPUs a day, until it’s the baddest subpool around (second to Comet, of course).

[10/21/2022 11:54 PM] allcloudy#0000
So close


[10/21/2022 11:55 PM] allcloudy#0000
Maybe this incentivizes @dadreboi  to finally put that gpu to use


[10/21/2022 11:55 PM] Nick#0000
(re @allcloudy : *100ghs*) 
 
 Hmmmm, do we go 3060tis or 3070s? I need another octominer


[10/21/2022 11:55 PM] allcloudy#0000
Both are fine choices.


[10/21/2022 11:57 PM] Nick#0000
(re @allcloudy : *Both are fine choices.*) 
 
 You guys have Octominers to sell or do you dropship them?


[10/21/2022 11:59 PM] allcloudy#0000
I have 10 spare from the 20 last ordered. may production. You said you were Ohio right? Our secret facility is just over the border in PA.

(re @allcloudy : *I have 10 spare from the 20 last ordered. may production. You said you were Ohio right? Our secret facility is just over the border in PA.*) 
 
 Yep, right in the middle of Ohio. Are they x12 or x8?


[10/22/2022 12:01 AM] allcloudy#0000
X12 high spec


[10/22/2022 12:01 AM] Nick#0000
Is that 240v only?

[10/22/2022 12:16 AM] Nick#0000
Dang, I didn't end up doing my panel upgrade so I'm still running on 110v. They definitely aren't the 3x1200 ones?


[10/22/2022 12:23 AM] allcloudy#0000
(re @Nick : *Dang, I didn't end up doing my panel upgrade so I'm still running on 110v. They definitely aren't the 3x1200 ones?*) 
 
 2x 1800 on the newest


[10/22/2022 12:23 AM] allcloudy#0000
I can check to see if they support 120 but I doubt it


[10/22/2022 12:23 AM] allcloudy#0000
Your panel probably just needs a 240 breaker installed


[10/22/2022 12:25 AM] Nick#0000
The panel is completely filled with breakers so I don't have any room left, it's only a 150amp panel


[10/22/2022 12:26 AM] allcloudy#0000
Ah


[10/22/2022 12:26 AM] allcloudy#0000
I know that dilemma


[10/22/2022 12:27 AM] Nick#0000
My girlfriend's house has plenty of room on her breaker but she isn't so thrilled about rigs coming over. But the garage would be just fine haha

 I can probably get another rig or two at my apartment. Got a few slots left on one of my rigs too. Might be able to squeeze out about another 2-3 g/h


[10/22/2022 3:23 AM] Shiny_Umbreon#0000
(re @Nick : *How much is the all-in costs?*) 
 
 24k with a 12 year 1.99% loan

14 Hyundai panels giving 5.6kw system. Going to be giving me 650-900kw/month


[10/22/2022 3:27 AM] Shiny_Umbreon#0000
And I get the 30% tax credit


[10/22/2022 7:32 AM] elazor#0115
Any reason why you put them on racks instead of just stacking them?


[10/22/2022 7:35 AM] elazor#0115

 That's a good APR. So it pays for one octominer rig per month about. About a 10ish year return with the tax credit?


[10/22/2022 2:19 PM] Nick#0000
Less if electricity continues to go up

 Flux-Erg is a different address in Zelcore so I think it might be counted separately in the snapshot. I'm not 100% sure though, I converted a stack to native flux and planning in putting it in as another Titan node stake

But the problem is the payment doesn’t show up on the website. And there’s still a 0.068 ERG “Unconfirmed Balance” which is there for a couple of weeks now (it was there when I was in default plasma pool and it is there now that I switched to flux smartpool). 🤷‍♂️

 Nope, they are in confirmed status so amounts havent been distributed to miners yet

[10/27/2022 12:36 AM] Alex#0000
A2000, 3070, or 3060TI for erg mining anypoint for the 3070 vs 3060ti if for autokytos2 only

(re @Alex : *A2000, 3070, or 3060TI for erg mining anypoint for the 3070 vs 3060ti if for autokytos2 only*) 
 
 Go for the 3070 if you can get it for the right price.  More bang for your buck with less efficiently.


[10/27/2022 2:16 AM] Alex#0000

(re @Alex : *With 100gh/s on flux subpool we should find about 1.5blocks a day no?*) 
 
 Probably closer to one a day right now but thats over time.  Could be 3 one day and 0 for the next 2 days.


[10/30/2022 7:48 AM] atom7ktm#0000
Assuming 100% luck (which is practically impossible) and no extreme difficulty fluctuations, 100gh/s should be netting a block every ~16 hours. It’s more realistic to say around 50 blocks per month.

 I thought he shut down all his rigs

(re @atom7ktm : *I thought he shut down all his rigs*) 
 
 Think he has like 30ish rigs up? Mostly on ergo/flux and a little bit on kaspa


[10/31/2022 1:40 AM] Nick#0000
He could lower that electricity usage, his 3070 ocs aren't the most efficient


[10/31/2022 1:42 AM] Nick#0000
He would be pretty much solo mining erg/flux lol


[10/31/2022 1:43 AM] Nick#0000
If he turned on all of his rigs he might be around 450g/h on erg


[10/31/2022 1:57 AM] Alex#0000
Yes he was pure eth knew nothing else so learning a lot now.


[10/31/2022 1:57 AM] Alex#0000
Someone did just turn on 50gb on default pool


[10/31/2022 1:58 AM] Alex#0000
Wonder if we will have to combine all hashrate on a single pool to compete with 2miners in the future

 I wouldn’t use server psu for such big cards. Those 6-pin connectors on the breakout boards tend to melt. They can’t withstand the watts (their spec is 75w max)

 Looks like you got paid for the block found a couple of days ago. Since then no blocks on ergopad pool which is why it’s not reflecting in your 24hr balance

(re @Al : *I can see in the personal stats

 In personal stats blocks mined is if your rigs actually found the block. Otherwise only care if the subpool you are in is finding the blocks

Actually not TRM related and not Hiveos Related as I'm getting the problem on other computers as well (that are not on hiveos)


[11/09/2022 7:03 PM] HipHopBlond#9606
it's either SSL encryption server problem, Or something in EU, or something on your end... idk

(re  : *<HipHopBlond> It's probably something in our Countries if a VPN helped you bypass it*) 
 
 Yeah it’s weird.  Just had one miner with the same issue but ended up working with 3056.   He ask had an issue because he was mining flux on the same rig.

hello, I've heard some rumor that soon ergo would be mineable with asic, is there any truth to this? Do you think that the ergo team would look for a solution to continue being resistant?

(re @rubenserg : *hello, I've heard some rumor that soon ergo would be mineable with asic, is there any truth to this? Do you think that the ergo team would look for a solution to continue being resistant?*) 
 
 From my understanding, it's not an asic. There are probably FPGAs already on the network but whoever has the capability of running them  aren't telling many people. The one from Osprey says that an update will come later for Ergo but it's hard to say if there are other companies developing asics or not

@Arohbe hi, like you see, in the 11/09/2022 I have been paid more than 0,95 ergo for 24 hours of mining, but for the last 24 hours or more and for the same hashrate, I have been paid only 0.201. Any clarification for that? The difficulty is the same (between 5. 5 and 6)

For more than 32 hours of mining with 1.30 Gh I got 0.2 as payement


[11/11/2022 8:36 AM] AhmedBoussema#0000
All shares was valid


[11/11/2022 8:36 AM] AhmedBoussema#0000
This is not legal at all


[11/11/2022 8:38 AM] AhmedBoussema#0000
In any profitability calculator, with 1.4 Gh in 32 hours, the minimum payout must be at least 1.3 ergo


[11/11/2022 8:40 AM] AhmedBoussema#0000
This is not good at all for the reputation of a new pool


[11/11/2022 8:42 AM] AhmedBoussema#0000
Despite they are no clear stats, no informations about the payment status, we trusted this pool, but like you see the payout not correctly at all😡


[11/11/2022 8:46 AM] AhmedBoussema#0000
We pay the fees of the electricity and we mine with negative profit, and you don't pay the real payout, you pay 15% of the correct earned amount


[11/11/2022 8:47 AM] glasgowm#0000
Same answer as above, not how mining works - rewards are based on the blocks found.


[11/11/2022 8:48 AM] K#0000
(re @AhmedBoussema : *This is not legal at all*) 
 
 It has nothing to do with legality, and everything to do with probability. Over time, you will get paid the same, but because we have a smaller hashrate, some days will have few blocks while others will have a ton.


[11/11/2022 8:48 AM] Xhariel#0000
Do yourself a favour and check out how PPLNS works @AhmedBoussema


[11/11/2022 8:49 AM] Xhariel#0000

My only complaint is the front end of the website. It’s really underwhelming and doesn’t do justice to the whole GetBlok pool and effort. That’s the only reason someone will not pick this otherwise great pool!

 Yeah it’s interesting as I recall when we first started developing this pool many said they were sick of the data pages where you can get lost in data.   Yet still seems that is what many are driven to.

[11/14/2022 11:04 PM] atom7ktm#0000
Being simple is one thing, being easy to use and eye-catching is another. These two don’t go hand in hand. I have seen complex websites being easy to use and eye-catching and I have seen simple websites being ugly and hard to use. Web design is a form of art.

Having used GetBlok for 2 months, I can say with relative certainty that the way the website works, keeps a lot of people away. A different front-end would surely attract a lot more miners and hashrate. Just my 2 cents, with love and good-willingness ❤️


[11/15/2022 12:44 AM] FlyingPig_69#0000
I find the website hard to navigate. Lack of intuitive navigation and slow.

For simplicity, look at flypool.
For datanerds, look at herominers.

I mine ergo, but in a different pool. 
I want to be able to get my mobile out and quickly get a glance on the status of my rigs, hashrate and payouts.

I don't want to spend more than 30 seconds...

With getblock thats not possible, the mobile view is not optimized, the info is in different pages and is slow to load.

Technology is awesome, but presentation needs improvement.

However, I understand that working on getting tech right is priority for now. Eventually, however, you should address the visual and navigational aspect.

[12/02/2022 4:44 PM] Xhariel#0000
To help understand how Smart Contracts-based payment processing occurs, the following is a break down of the sequence status and what happens in each phase:

Confirmed – Block has received 20 confirmations. Effort for the block has been calculated now, and our notification bot has sent a message to our miners about it.
Pre-Processed – Block has had its shares calculated and an estimate of unconfirmed balances have been made.
Processing – Block has been sent to the smart contracts. We’re awaiting confirmation of the transaction to finalize balances.
Processed – The transaction which sent the block to the smart contracts has been confirmed, and unconfirmed balances have been finalized. Because some of our SubPools requires that we interact with external exchanges (such as ErgoDEX), unconfirmed balances may change slightly once we send it to the smart contract.
Initiated – Initial payments have been made and are awaiting confirmation of these transactions on-chain.
Paid – All payment transactions have been confirmed on-chain. Miners have received their assets in their wallet. Payment, earnings, and confirmed balances are also updated at this point

(re @Telegram : *⚠️ Attention GetBlok.io Miners ⚠️

We have some unfortunate news.  Effective tomorrow we will be closing the SmartPool.  

We want to thank everyone who supported us.  It was a hard decision but has to be. 

Please read the article below for further details as to what is next.

(re @Raul : *Can someone tell me why there's 67 NETA pending which is not being confirmed. I'm mining on NETA smartpool and the dashboard confirms and pays what I mine but there's always 67 NETA of pending unconfirmed balance.*) 
 
 Was almost certainly already paid to you, but the UI balance was not updating. It won't show up in the UI but can be seen in the explorer if you look around.

 So sad to hear this guys. Your setup is awesome and the knowledge of your team is beyond stellar. It’s been an honor to be able to mine to your smart pools and be part of it all. I’ll be geared up and waiting for wherever or whatever you come up with next.  Much ❤️!

 Really hope this is only a “bye for now” as you say. I wish all the best to you guys. Take this opportunity to sit back a bit and relax for a little while, clear up thoughts, regain strength and bounce back in the (near) future. I am sure you will all come back stronger and I am looking forward to hearing your next project(s). 🦾🥰👍🏼

 No unfortunately not.  Although the original subpooling is open source and functional iirc.  A bunch of miners could potentially group together and subpool off of hero or enigma.

I had the honor of mining the very first block on GetBlok and hate to see this wonder of a mining pool disappearing.
I am going to hang around this TG channel until you find a way to go back online, soon, I hope. Many thanks personally @Arohbe @allcloudy and team; it has been an extremely fun ride.

with getblok closing subpools, is the code open source to allow others to try to prop up independent ones?


[12/22/2022 8:08 PM] cannon#3541
I believe that was part of their announcement or stated somewhere here on discord. Enigmapool did a swapping ERG for a token that someone was launching. @ProSavage ran that... not sure if PROs code is open, but I believe he has put several things on git in the past


[12/23/2022 3:35 AM] allcloudy#0000
(re  : *<liquid_phase> with getblok closing subpools, is the code open source to allow others to try to prop up independent ones?*) 
 
 All our code is open source except UI. But it’s not as simple as just git pull and run.


[12/23/2022 5:59 PM] Alex#0000
Hey guys just asking this here because your all so smart.

I have my seed phrase for erg mobile wallet. Is there a way to get the private key ? 

The problem is the seed phrase restores a wallet with no erg, the blockchain shows nothing was moved

Is it possible to have a seed phrase decrypt two different private keys?


[12/23/2022 6:04 PM] Alex#0000

[12/23/2022 6:08 PM] GliTch_40#0000
generally means it was a recovery seed that used a different derived path from a different device (hardware) or wallet .... or that you have used an incorrect word in your original and unluckily that opened a new wallet that is empty


[12/23/2022 6:12 PM] GliTch_40#0000
like they mentioned on that page > use the original app or device to restore access if possible create a new one on the proper standard and transfer between them to restore access


[12/23/2022 7:15 PM] Alex#0000
it was the ergo mobile app on iso which is gone. Hmm... Oh well what can you do.

[12/23/2022 7:21 PM] GliTch_40#0000
What did you recover it in this time?


[12/23/2022 7:22 PM] GliTch_40#0000
or can you find an old version and restore that to regain the wallet in the short term


[12/23/2022 7:22 PM] GliTch_40#0000
then use one of the available to create a new one and transfer the funds to

 Todays Back to the Past lesson:

1/ We had enough of waiting 3 months for electrical service hookup from the Duquesne Light Company. It is now impacting our business and revenue.

So we wrote (gasp) a letter and mailed to their president on Monday.
