@everyone The Ergo Foundation would like to start gathering a general consensus regarding the upcoming Soft Fork Vote.


[12/29/2021 7:05 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
GetBlok will be leaving the decision to the miners on our pool and will be doing some form of a pre-vote.   As you know, we are exploring other methods such as POW issued tokens if time allows.  The miners being vocal appear to be generally opposed and continue to focus on profitability related to current price

Getblok's view is close to ours - miners decide. However a lot of them already DM'd me and ask to support the soft fork.

Dear pool operators and solo miners, please note that EIP-27 is locked in now and will be activated at height 777,217 . Please check your node version (should be 4.0.29+, 4.0.31 is preferable) and config (4.0.31 will not start if config has no EIP-27 checks set on in case of mining being enabled). , see https://www.ergoforum.org/t/eip-27-mainnet-activation-voting-and-final-details/3585/2 for more details.

EIP-27 Mainnet Activation Voting and Final Details
EIP-27 got locked in on the mainnet: there was an epoch already with more than 888 votes out of 1024 (actually , there were few epochs with more than 92% hashrate support).  Thus this is mandatory for miners to check EIP-27 rules by using this setting:  ergo {   chain {     reemission {       checkReemissionRules = true     }   } }  otherwise, a...

Dear mining pools and solo miners, EIP-27 successfully activated @ 777,217. Now please check rewards and payouts carefully. Maybe you can find this forum post useful: https://www.ergoforum.org/t/eip-27-mainnet-activation-voting-and-final-details/3585/3

EIP-27 Mainnet Activation Voting and Final Details
EIP-27 got successfully activated @ block # 777,217 . Now the biggest question for pools and miners is how to handle rewards and payments.  In the first place, note that emission in Ergo is done via a contract (releasing ERGs each block according to a schedule set in the contract). After EIP-27 soft-fork,  re-emission tokens are attached to mini...

Dear mining pools and polo miners, new version is released, and in particular it is fixing some issues causing increased orphans rate sometimes.

Dear miners! 

As 5.0 activation is coming after successful voting, please update your nodes to 5.0.1 or later. No rush, the update must be done before block #889,856 (in ~20 days approximately). In case of non-update, there is a chance of non-valid blocks generation.

More details: https://www.ergoforum.org/t/ergo-5-0-activation-details/4043

Ergo 5.0 activation details
On block #824,320 ( Ergo Explorer ) voting for 5.0 was started. The voting got concluded with block #857,087, with enough (90+%) support for 5.0 given.  With block #857,088 pre-activation delay started. And 5.0 will be activated on block #889,856.  5.0 is soft-fork, so old nodes do not need to update. However, mining nodes do need for update. Fo...
