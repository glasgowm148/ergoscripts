trying to get ergo-bootstrap running on my computer but when i copy paste the command from github all it does is open the file and doesnt run the code


[10/19/2021 9:03 PM] g_w87#1147
im doing this to get the db and chaingrabber installed and then moving onto the ergo.watch installation


[10/19/2021 9:04 PM] g_w87#1147
do i need to modify the ergo-bootstrap file type? its show up on windows as just "file" and not an .exe

[10/19/2021 9:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
Think you're better using AppKit - don't think ergo bootstrap is maintained.


[10/19/2021 9:46 PM] g_w87#1147
Ok thank you


[10/19/2021 9:48 PM] g_w87#1147
I‚Äôm trying to install chaingrabber and figured bootstrap was the way to do that‚Ä¶ appkit has chaingrabber?


[10/19/2021 10:07 PM] glasgowm#9381
Now you have Appkit enabled in your project, but what can you do now? Appkit provides methods for the following tasks:

Fetch data from Ergo Explorer API
Interact with Ergo Node, both public and private methods
Build transactions and sign them
Helper methods to handle cryptographics like calculating PK addresses from secrets

[10/19/2021 10:11 PM] g_w87#1147
thats what im working up towards - but it requires explorers chaingrabber and database


[10/20/2021 2:26 AM] abchris#8522
I started with ergo bootstrap as well, but ran into issues and was stuck on older versions.
Since you're using docker, the ergo watch repo has a `build.sh`, which prepares a Dockerfile for the chain-grabber. If you understand what's in there, you can replicate the steps on Windows. I can add a `build.bat` equivalent if that helps.


[10/20/2021 2:27 AM] g_w87#1147
Def won‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs in there


[10/20/2021 2:28 AM] g_w87#1147
Or at least can‚Äôt promise I can


[10/20/2021 2:28 AM] g_w87#1147
But will def try


[10/20/2021 2:30 AM] abchris#8522
haha, no worries, it just downloads the explorer backend source, unzips it and moves the dockerfile that comes with some directories higher up.


[10/20/2021 2:30 AM] g_w87#1147
Ok ok


[10/20/2021 2:32 AM] g_w87#1147
I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm using docker either - all I did was download it in an effort to try to figure this out


[10/20/2021 2:33 AM] g_w87#1147
So if there are other solutions I‚Äôm all ears


[10/20/2021 2:34 AM] abchris#8522
I see.


[10/20/2021 2:36 AM] abchris#8522
Step 1: you need to download the explorer-backend source (latest release) and then compile the chain-grabber.


[10/20/2021 2:37 AM] abchris#8522
I'm new to scala too, but what I know is that you need to have SBT installed and then run `sbt chain-grabber/assembly` to compile the grabber (see the explorer-backend readme).


[10/20/2021 2:38 AM] g_w87#1147
Ok


[10/20/2021 2:38 AM] g_w87#1147
Thank you


[10/20/2021 2:38 AM] g_w87#1147

[12/01/2021 7:37 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
no problem i just started a couple days ago too and learning as i go along. 

for your rpi definitely recommend mounting an SSD to it since you're looking at 50GB+ of historical blockchain data

then you'll need the backend explorer: https://github.com/ergoplatform/explorer-backend


[12/01/2021 7:38 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
i mean i was half hoping i could just query @abchris database for ergowatch haha but looks like you need a local node to get that info

[12/05/2021 4:06 AM] abchris#8522
I thought you had a node running. But seems you're using the public node in the default config.
I'm guessing that's why it's taking so much longer to sync...

@curbsideprophet You're syncing the database right now right? Did you do the with explorer_backend/chaingrabber or something else?


[12/05/2021 6:03 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
inside the `explorer-backend-9.4.3` i just executed `sbt chain-grabber/run`

[12/05/2021 6:07 PM] quokka#1273
and once I run the sbt chaingrabber does that interract with my node at all or do those cooperate later on?


[12/05/2021 6:07 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
i am not sure of the specifics but it loops through each block and dumps that data into your postgres db


[12/05/2021 6:10 PM] quokka#1273
I'm guessing it doesnt use the node for that though


[12/05/2021 6:10 PM] curbsideprophet#5083

@abchris any chance you know if i turn off the chain-grabber sync to reboot and then run it again will it know where to pick up or start from the beginning again? what about handling duplicate entires?

[12/05/2021 7:45 PM] cookieKun#0322
although based on my observation each exchange has multiple addresses and recently KuCoin has been moving around the reserves (for dust collection?) so it can get tricky to track net inflow/outflows

There's over a 1M ERG that goes through 9 addresses and ends up in Gate.io's current main address (confirmed by an Ergonaut on reddit). Here's the list:
```
9iKFBBrryPhBYVGDKHuZQW7SuLfuTdUJtTPzecbQ5pQQzD4VykC (current main)

9exS2B892HTiDkqhcWnj1nzsbYmVn7ameVb1d2jagUWTqaLxfTX (first accumulating)
```
Pic above is based on first 3 addresses.
I was going to consider the lot as Gate addresses, but here's the thing, 9exS2B89 started transacting in October 2019, 1 year before Gate.io listing ERG. Seems odd... What do you guys think? Common practice for exchanges?


[12/07/2021 12:10 PM] glasgowm#9381

looks great and i wonder if the 9 is an exhaustive list


[12/07/2021 12:31 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
using only `node_outputs` table is leaving me flying blind on what is being sent vs what is retained in the wallet. not sure if i'm missing something or ya'll have a workaround


[12/07/2021 12:57 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
in my mind, if i wanted a SQL query to compute total ERG for a single wallet address, I am unable to do that with the current schema since utxo model requires the input data to join on the output table. is that a correct assumption?


[12/07/2021 1:07 PM] curbsideprophet#5083

Definitely not üôÇ


[12/07/2021 5:24 PM] abchris#8522
Yeah, you need to join outputs and inputs using the box_id. Basically, outputs show you when a box was created, and the inputs if/when it was spent.


[12/07/2021 5:25 PM] abchris#8522
ergo watch takes a snapshot of unspent boxes every 24. For more resolution and a single address you can use something like this:
```
with outputs as (
    select timestamp
        , sum(value) as value
    from node_outputs nos
    where nos.main_chain
        and nos.address = '9exS2B892HTiDkqhcWnj1nzsbYmVn7ameVb1d2jagUWTqaLxfTX'
    group by 1
), inputs as (
    select txs.timestamp
        , sum(nos.value) as value
    from node_inputs nis
    join node_outputs nos on nos.box_id = nis.box_id
    join node_transactions txs on txs.id = nis.tx_id
    where nos.main_chain and nis.main_chain
        and nos.address = '9exS2B892HTiDkqhcWnj1nzsbYmVn7ameVb1d2jagUWTqaLxfTX'
    group by 1
), balance as (
    select coalesce(nos.timestamp, nis.timestamp) as timestamp
        , coalesce(nos.value, 0) - coalesce(nis.value, 0) as diff
        , (sum(coalesce(nos.value, 0) - coalesce(nis.value, 0))
           over (order by coalesce(nos.timestamp, nis.timestamp) rows between unbounded preceding and current row)
          ) as bal
    from outputs nos
    full outer join inputs nis on nis.timestamp = nos.timestamp
    order by 1
)
select to_timestamp(timestamp / 1000) as t
    , diff / 10^9 as diff
    , bal / 10^9 as balance
from balance

Yes, it's all ready to go, just been holding off while "fine-tuning" the list of cex addresses


[12/07/2021 5:27 PM] abchris#8522
The tx_id in inputs is the spending tx, the tx_id in outputs is the creation tx.

Hi, I'm listening to Ergo Pulse and just heard about this. I was actually just looking at doing something like this. I was looking at how to import the data into Neo4j


[12/07/2021 7:14 PM] KuantumWinter#1976
I'll go through the chat and see what you have done but I would like to help if possible


[12/07/2021 7:15 PM] NoahErgo#4349
are new ergo.watch features coming soon? Can't wait to get my hands on this and play around


[12/07/2021 7:16 PM] abchris#8522
In less than 24h. Just need to sync the database accounting for new CEX addresses. I'll post it here and on reddit when live.

Welcome! Just googled Neo4j, seems promising!!!


[12/07/2021 11:32 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
shouldn't be too hard. to confirm the formula is it...

`(ERG miner sell price) / avg(ERG miner sell price last 365 days) `

?


[12/07/2021 11:35 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
or...is it just `price / avg price last 365 days`


[12/07/2021 11:35 PM] abchris#8522
Looks like amount of coins issued times price at time of issuance


[12/07/2021 11:35 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
ahh


[12/07/2021 11:36 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
` (ERG mined * ERG $ value) / avg 365 (ERG mined * ERG $ value) `

Well it's definitely eye-opening, thanks for bringing this up!
The explorer's backend dumps the blockchain in a postgresql database. Neo4j seems to have some guidance on how to import such RDBMS data: <https://neo4j.com/developer/relational-to-graph-import/>. That's probably the best place to start. üî•


[12/08/2021 8:33 AM] Platypus#2410
good take, lets add >10 erg, >100 erg, and >100,000 erg

We can also add HODL waves etc. (by calculating the age of the unspent boxes)


[12/08/2021 8:33 AM] Platypus#2410
Man i'm hyped for this

You're welcome. Thanks for the link! I was just looking at how to import the data first to python and then read it with Neo4j. 

I was lucky to find Neo4j. I was at a Tech Expo in Amsterdam a couple of weeks ago and meet with one of their representatives. So I started looking into it

in the future, and don't get me wrong i'm hyped as fuck, it would be cool to correct for entities (sometimes holding multiple wallets) in stead of single wallets. is there anything known on methodology of glassnode how they correct for this?


[12/08/2021 8:37 AM] abchris#8522
And here's some example queries from the explorer api: <https://github.com/ergoplatform/explorer-backend/tree/master/modules/explorer-core/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/explorer/db/queries>


[12/08/2021 8:41 AM] abchris#8522
Nothing open as far as I'm aware. They do have good blog posts about their general approach tho. Seems they apply statistical inference to determine what is linked to an exchange/entity and tend to be pretty conservative, i.e.  avoid false positives.

[12/08/2021 4:18 PM] Hamilton#4703
These are pretty nice, I only wish these type of charts would be a little more polished lol


[12/08/2021 4:19 PM] Hamilton#4703
In terms of functionality they're nice and all, but I would like to see something done in apache echarts for example


[12/08/2021 4:20 PM] Hamilton#4703
But that is a common thing in "all places data", usually the tools to chart are not the most beautiful


[12/08/2021 4:38 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
Yeah I hear you. I think there‚Äôs a trade off between scale and mass consumption


[12/08/2021 4:39 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
So i imagine ergowatch is like macro info of the platform


[12/08/2021 4:39 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
What I want to focus on is the micro level stuff that‚Äôs hidden in the details


[12/08/2021 4:39 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
That‚Äôs where we can fine tune and get more polished


[12/08/2021 4:40 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
But overall I agree the charts are not the best for ease of consumption it hurts the eyes with all that data haha


[12/08/2021 4:42 PM] Hamilton#4703
I'm a embedded system developer, so this is out of my expertise, but last month I was doing some portfolio analytics, python is extremely easy and useful for that, but their visualization is disgusting, so I decided to do a full web application with python-django in the backend and angular on the front end and I was using apache echarts ( they absolutely beautfiul and so much better than chartjs), but then, it started to be just too much to do (front end, back end, data analytics, deployment) for a person that never worked with these before, so I understand why some people keep their charts simples and don't care that much about looks


[12/08/2021 4:42 PM] Hamilton#4703
In the end, the important thing is the data, but I think, having beautiful pages make a difference lol


[12/08/2021 4:43 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
I use python at work but in terms of data science visualization I think R specifically ggplot2 is the best

How did no one think of that before... Probably more parsing work ahead, but clever approach.
You'll have to keep up with any format changes (if any). The explorer grabber uses the node api to sync its own database, so any node schema changes are abstracted away.
Keep us posted on how it goes!

I have to step up my on-chain analysis first I guess lol


[12/09/2021 12:26 PM] Hamilton#4703
There are lot of information that can be gathered but I'm not sure how to use it


[12/09/2021 12:27 PM] Hamilton#4703
Is that an information that is somehow stored in transaction, or you want to relate the datetime of the transaction to the datetime of price?


[12/09/2021 12:29 PM] g_w87#1147
Maybe a bit of both? If there were 100 ERG it would be the avg price that those 100 ERG were last transacted for?

[12/10/2021 8:12 AM] apexpool#3878
I think the update that made TRM drop the hashrate with about 25% affected it more.

HODL waves could be very interesting, and Long Term Holder and Short term holder supply (and ratio)

LTH  are defined by wallets who have not moved coins at least 155 days, STH shorter than 155days 
https://insights.glassnode.com/sth-lth-sopr-mvrv/ for the analysis on defining those. If i may suggest, we should perform the same analyses just to benchmark, but for comparability reasons we could copy Glassnode's definitions (maybe BTC should be regarded as the most accurate dataset for methodology). We could then show it like these waves https://insights.glassnode.com/follow-the-smart-money/ 

And calculate the ratio between them https://twitter.com/WClementeIII/status/1427416746034704384/photo/1

could we in a way differentiate between DIY miners (retail) and professional mining operations?


[12/10/2021 11:13 PM] Platypus#2410
just food for thought


[12/11/2021 2:13 AM] g_w87#1147
Interesting thought but no idea! the commercial miners would definitely have more incentive to sell given their need to pay for fixed costs in fiat. Do you think differentiating is material?


[12/11/2021 2:13 AM] g_w87#1147
Retail miners are probably a much smaller % of mining emissions but that‚Äôs pure speculation


[12/11/2021 2:16 AM] g_w87#1147
Emissions + hodling isn‚Äôt sell pressure while emissions + selling drives down the price


[12/11/2021 9:13 AM] Platypus#2410
exactly, i don't know if we can make a cut off based on hashing power or so, also because miners might often be joined in mining pools. Could ask MHS_Sam maybe?


[12/11/2021 9:28 AM] abchris#8522
Pools are just like exchange addresses üôÇ I've  seen the getblock one in some other channel, so we could break that down.


[12/11/2021 9:28 AM] abchris#8522
Haven't looked at all at what miner related data is available. How does one determine hashing power? From rewards amounts/frequency? Or is this something that the network is aware of.


[12/11/2021 9:42 AM] andee#4722
difficulty / (avg block time x blocks)


[12/11/2021 9:44 AM] abchris#8522

will have to add a disk to my server and get everything setup, easier to contribute then starting something üôÇ


[12/11/2021 10:05 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
one way i've been thinking about the above:
1) identify miner wallets
2) determine their payout schedule
3) classify retail vs industrial miners based on the above (ex: consistent payout of 1 erg every 7 days then retail...if 300 payout every 1 day then industrial, etc.)


[12/11/2021 10:07 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
obvi the n amount would differ based on default pool settings or what the miner has configured (ex: 1 is default but they select 100 as payout). either way if we can identify frequency and movement to exchanges can give an idea of macro miner behavior


[12/11/2021 10:09 AM] curbsideprophet#5083

I'd find it hard to believe if it wasn't for what we see in TVL:

[12/12/2021 10:13 PM] abchris#8522
Seems like mining rewards went to a lot of different contract address, then all got folded in Q1 2020. Can see that the top1000 addresses amount to over 10M ERG...


[12/12/2021 10:15 PM] abchris#8522
If you switch back to relative view, that's 87% of circ supply back then!
The top100 contract addresses have held 50% pretty much since mainnet launch up to Q1 2020.


[12/12/2021 10:17 PM] abchris#8522
If that was a single miner, he had well over 50% of the hashing power over a long period.


[12/12/2021 10:18 PM] cookieKun#0322
that's some foresight damn


[12/12/2021 10:20 PM] cookieKun#0322
would it be possible to figure out which addresses these ERGs went to?


[12/12/2021 10:21 PM] cookieKun#0322
would be good to figure out how much influence this miner has left on ERGs price


[12/12/2021 10:24 PM] abchris#8522
Possibly. But from the looks of it it went to 100's of wallet addresses (you can see the nb of addresses with over 1k/10k erg jump in april 2020)


[12/12/2021 10:55 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
talk about a literal early bird!


[12/12/2021 11:00 PM] abchris#8522
Anyone knows when miners managed to circumvent non-outsourcability through smart contracts? If that was like weeks after launch, then that's what we're seeing here.  Total TVL was a steady 87% of circulating supply during Q4 2019 and Q1 2020.


[12/12/2021 11:06 PM] g_w87#1147
Is that the hard fork Armenio has talked about in the past?


[12/12/2021 11:07 PM] g_w87#1147
1 mining pool, multiple addresses when they distribute rewards (is that how it works?) either way sounds like you‚Äôre saying 10m early bird whale isn‚Äôt supported by the data unless 1 person owns those 100+ addresses?


[12/12/2021 11:09 PM] g_w87#1147
And like @glasgowm said, I always attributed BW to SigUSD / SigRSV manipulation and not purposely depressing the ERG price


[12/12/2021 11:10 PM] g_w87#1147
Although I guess that can go hand in hand


[12/12/2021 11:11 PM] abchris#8522
Yes, Ergo's only had 1 hard fork so far, in feb 2021, and that was to turn non-outsourcability off since miners found a way to bypass it using smart contracts.


[12/12/2021 11:12 PM] abchris#8522
Yep. I mean why would you mine to a contract if you're the only one managing the funds?


[12/12/2021 11:12 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
safe to assume it is because they didn't want to have mining pools? (like we have now)


[12/12/2021 11:13 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
i just mine the thing but i dont know the history of it all and i joined in apr/may 2021


[12/12/2021 11:14 PM] abchris#8522
That was the idea yes


[12/12/2021 11:15 PM] glasgowm#9381
we noted 150k ERG walls started appearing when he was in a short position - we sat at $3.99999 for weeks


[12/12/2021 11:16 PM] g_w87#1147
Ok right, I know the last time he jumped on RSV he dumped the price hard first so what I said is def not totally correct


[12/12/2021 11:16 PM] glasgowm#9381
sounds like something to do with the HF then maybe


[12/12/2021 11:17 PM] g_w87#1147
HF = ?


[12/12/2021 11:17 PM] g_w87#1147
Hedgies?


[12/12/2021 11:17 PM] abchris#8522
hard fork


[12/12/2021 11:17 PM] g_w87#1147
Oh


[12/12/2021 11:18 PM] g_w87#1147
Hard fork would pollute past data?


[12/12/2021 11:19 PM] abchris#8522
No, not at all, doesn't affect the data.


[12/12/2021 11:19 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
it's just context around historical data


[12/12/2021 11:19 PM] g_w87#1147
Yeah didn‚Äôt think so, so this 10m whale is a myth or what?


[12/12/2021 11:21 PM] abchris#8522
If it was a contract grouping miners, it wouldn't be needed after the HF anymore, so might explain why they stopped mining to it. Don't know when HF was announced but it only took place in feb this year.


[12/12/2021 11:26 PM] g_w87#1147
Selling walls can just be algos or even exchanges too


[12/12/2021 11:27 PM] quokka#1273
I remember THE DAY this broke and it shot up


[12/12/2021 11:27 PM] glasgowm#9381
So looks like 90% of the supply was put in a contract on the date of the HF then slowly comes out the next 2 months?


[12/12/2021 11:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
maybe someone with a private bot, size of the walls makes it unlikely to be exchanges/trading bots/etc imo


[12/12/2021 11:28 PM] g_w87#1147
For sure


[12/12/2021 11:29 PM] g_w87#1147

[12/12/2021 11:38 PM] glasgowm#9381
yeah it'll just be measuring the popular contract addresses (sigusd/ergodex/auctionhouse). So not sure what's going on with that spike - 90% of the circ supply was put into hundreds of different contract addresses across the top 1k?


[12/12/2021 11:40 PM] g_w87#1147
Sorry, top 10 identical to top 100; was missing an extra 0


[12/12/2021 11:41 PM] glasgowm#9381

Still wild to see wallets 11-100 Are such a small %


[12/12/2021 11:45 PM] abchris#8522
Nah, what it shows is that 90% of emission went to contracts, then contracts distributed to 100's of wallet addresses in April 2020, HF was in Feb 2021.


[12/12/2021 11:46 PM] glasgowm#9381

It is TVL, just showing TVL in top 10 contracts with highest TVL, then 100 etc.

[12/13/2021 12:00 AM] g_w87#1147
That makes sense


[12/13/2021 12:01 AM] glasgowm#9381
in the context of this before we had pools people figured out they could pool together with SCs


[12/13/2021 12:01 AM] g_w87#1147
TVL wouldn‚Äôt totally relate to whale hunt right?


[12/13/2021 12:01 AM] g_w87#1147
Oh ok


[12/13/2021 12:01 AM] g_w87#1147
Good context


[12/13/2021 12:01 AM] glasgowm#9381
Autolykos v1 originally had non-outsourcability built-in, however, it became apparent that with smart contracts it's basically impossible to prevent pools, so they turned it off so that not only larger players were able to take advantage of the loophole. Ergo is now focusing on memory hardness in an attempt to keep mining as fair as possible, which should help prevent ASICs mining at least. There are also some improvements for pooling, e.g. Stratum 2 protocol

‚ÄúBypassing Non-Outsourceable Proof-of-Work Schemes Using Collateralized Smart Contracts‚Äù https://ia.cr/2020/044 was presented by Alex Chepurnoy at WTSC workshop associated with Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2020 in Malaysia

Look at contract counts

It starts to increase linearly around that time. Seems they changed how it worked


[12/13/2021 12:10 AM] glasgowm#9381
Is it maybe people mining to their own contract address, then dipping when people shifted to make-shift pools?


[12/13/2021 12:11 AM] abchris#8522
Each reward going to a different contract

[12/13/2021 12:14 AM] abchris#8522
Anyways, guess 10M solominer wasn‚Äôt that solo after all


[12/13/2021 12:16 AM] g_w87#1147
For my sake, how do you see that in the data


[12/13/2021 12:21 AM] abchris#8522
Nothing confirmed yet, but I find it odd that a solo miner would mine to a contract (unless he wanted to cover his tracks somewhat) and above all, that he would have had 87% of total hashing power for over 6 months straight! Sure, things were different back then, but 87%?


[12/13/2021 12:21 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
And rejects the hypothesis that one person is suppressing the price ?


[12/13/2021 12:22 AM] g_w87#1147
Ok I‚Äôm following!


[12/13/2021 12:23 AM] abchris#8522
What would the motivation be? More miner rewards?


[12/13/2021 12:24 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
No idea but a year or so into the project with one miner handling 87% of HS when there is definitely more profitable coins is an anomaly to me at least


[12/13/2021 12:24 AM] g_w87#1147
It would have to correspond with a larger short position in order to benefit


[12/13/2021 12:26 AM] g_w87#1147
Also u have to be a big time miner to maintain that kind of position for 6+ months considering the level of inflation


[12/13/2021 12:26 AM] curbsideprophet#5083

Without looking at the data, price action / slow bleed is related to inflationary emissions

Miners paying for fixed costs / selling rewards

Emission is only a tiny fraction of our avg daily volume.


[12/13/2021 7:27 AM] g_w87#1147
10%?


[12/13/2021 7:29 AM] g_w87#1147
(67.5 x 60 x 24) / 2 x $5.75 = $280k


[12/13/2021 7:30 AM] g_w87#1147
Volume ~$2M


[12/13/2021 7:34 AM] glasgowm#9381
AVG is 5 but that's dropped in the past few weeks. About 10% tho yeh


[12/13/2021 7:36 AM] g_w87#1147
Not a massive % but seems material, at least that‚Äôs what I have to tell myself with this price action


[12/13/2021 7:42 AM] glasgowm#9381
Well if he was solo he wouldn't need contract addresses. Assumed to be a group working together.

10m would take ~200 days to mine if you won every block straight. Not sure  that 10m Œ£ whale is real unless every miner in the early days worked together


[12/13/2021 8:57 AM] glasgowm#9381
or the ones that did won the blocks

TVL back then sat at 87% of circulating supply for months and peaked above 10M

I once asked about decompiling ergotree contracts. Will try to dig up the answer I got, but would be helpful if we can inspect what those contracts had for spending conditions.

Early TVL activity is definitely mining. Absolute value is linear growth while % is straight line. I think spending conditions would be interesting to understand because the drop in TVL corresponds with price decrease and also the Covid flash crash of bitcoin and stock market

So that‚Äôs also your answer for who BW is most likely? Like you said in your article, it was most likely an early miner


[12/13/2021 9:50 AM] g_w87#1147
Seems like that farm is the one who had the bags to pull the strings


[12/13/2021 10:05 AM] glasgowm#9381
Doubtful, he proposed a HF to fix it. If you read the discussions there seems there was 2 competing public pools, private pools, mining farms, individual miners, etc. So unclear how to interpret the chart

It looks like bigevil released his miner with optimisations around that date - before that top 100 had 6M ERG from miners mining to multi-sig addresses presumably. 

Once there was a public miner the rest of supply jumped into contract addresses with their collateral and we see the 1k spike. A week later the top 100 withdraw 700k ERG, then three weeks later the top 10 withdraw 1M erg - and then the remaining 600k over the next few weeks


[12/13/2021 10:37 AM] glasgowm#9381
Full 6M withdrawn between Feb-May 2020, but unclear how many entities that is exactly

Idk why it jumps ahead a day when I copy the link‚Ä¶ @kushti ‚ÄúThe nonce pattern analysis I‚Äôve done suggests that there are two farms, a big one and a much smaller one. But does it really matter how many farms are there, when one controls over 90% of the hashrate?‚Äù

[12/13/2021 11:21 AM] g_w87#1147
More for the trading folks, but BigEvil basically comes up with a pricing model / break-even price for ERG given difficulty + emissions + fixed costs. He also seems to suggest that miners have to be crazy to mine and hold anything but BTC and ETH so it seems like that 10% sell pressure from miners is real


[12/13/2021 12:54 PM] glasgowm#9381
well the good news is only 1.5M erg have ever been mixed so should be traceable

mhs_sam going to dig into it later this week, seems 1 farm jumped on from genesis and had 90% of hash and only large farms could compete, then private pools appeared and ultimately public pools and a HF to remove non-outsourceability.

Hey @abchris - Saw your tweet about ergo analytics and would love to help in any way I can! 
I don't have much linux experience for configuring a node and syncing with Postgres, so that would be a learning curve for me.

Well I can confidently say now that using your own node vs the master node made no difference for my chain grabber

What is going on here‚Ä¶ what grabber version are ya‚Äôll using?

how did you come to this conclusion?


[12/15/2021 6:32 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
i am using this: https://github.com/ergoplatform/explorer-backend


[12/15/2021 6:32 PM] quokka#1273
I left my node running long with the chaingrabber for a day and managed to go from block 390k to 403k


[12/15/2021 6:33 PM] quokka#1273
me too


[12/15/2021 6:33 PM] abchris#8522
Sure, but which release, I think I‚Äôm still on an older one


[12/15/2021 6:33 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
9.4.3: https://github.com/ergoplatform/explorer-backend/releases/tag/9.4.3

You‚Äôre running it on a desktop, right? So pi‚Äôs not the issue


[12/15/2021 6:35 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
yeah quokka is running not on pi (windows i believe)


[12/15/2021 6:36 PM] quokka#1273
Yessir. Windows 10, 8gb ram, 1tb HDD (I highly recommend SSD though)


[12/15/2021 6:36 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
and for me: rpi4 4gb ram with 2tb ssd & ethernet connection


[12/15/2021 6:36 PM] quokka#1273
processor should be fine, its an I7, so ram/HDD might be the issue


[12/15/2021 6:37 PM] quokka#1273
ok so maybe my problem isnt ssd lol


[12/15/2021 6:37 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
i am not running local node. quokka is using local node.


[12/15/2021 6:38 PM] abchris#8522
I have it on 4th gen i5, doing just fine, cpu‚Äôs not an issue


[12/15/2021 7:47 PM] abchris#8522
I'm on 9.4.3 as well, but went through most of the syncing with an older version. Doubt that's issue the tho.


[12/15/2021 7:49 PM] abchris#8522
At this point, the only difference I see is that I use Docker and have it configured to rotate log files and limit their size to 10MB or so. So wondering if you guys just don't have a huuuge logfile that's causing things to slow down somehow? Maybe try clearing the log?


[12/15/2021 7:50 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
where to find that file? and what's the best way to rotate without starting from scratch at docker?


[12/15/2021 7:59 PM] abchris#8522
I have an `explorer.log` next to my grabber jar. Just stop the grabber, delete the log, turn it back on. If you were asking about docker, I've got log settings configured in the `docker-compose.yml` on github.


[12/15/2021 8:24 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
i hvae all this stuff in that folder lol

[12/15/2021 8:26 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
safe to delete? it wasn't there before when i first started (not sure how that would make a difference)


[12/15/2021 8:33 PM] abchris#8522
Oh so it is already rotating the logs‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt bother then


[12/15/2021 8:35 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
üò¢  lol


[12/15/2021 8:36 PM] abchris#8522
But you can defo rm the zipped logs, unless you want to look into them


[12/15/2021 8:38 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
yeah keep `explorer.log` and `rm explorer*.gz` is what i'm thinking


[12/15/2021 8:38 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
i mean i have a ton of space available so i'm scratching my head


[12/15/2021 8:39 PM] abchris#8522
Won‚Äôt speed up your sync, that‚Äôs for sure


[12/15/2021 8:41 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
i mentioned this stalling in the weekly dev update and kushti mentioned it might be a firewall restriction since it is a node controlled by him: https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/669989266478202917/920668567437967391


[12/15/2021 8:42 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
he sent me a DM and waiting for response if there's a different endpoint i should reference instead


[12/15/2021 8:52 PM] abchris#8522
That‚Äôs why I suggested trying a local node, but that didn‚Äôt help quokka much üòï


[12/15/2021 9:31 PM] Hamilton#4703
Just so I understand, the explorer API would provide the same data as the chain grabber? Cause I assume the explorer is receiving the data from the chain grabber


[12/15/2021 9:31 PM] Hamilton#4703
Just trying to understand what you guys are doing


[12/15/2021 9:32 PM] Hamilton#4703
Eventually want to mess with the data too, trying to understand the process


[12/15/2021 9:48 PM] quokka#1273
Could it be an issue with the chaingrabber? Maybe something is fundamentally different with ergo at block 360k that slows down the grabber


[12/15/2021 9:48 PM] quokka#1273
The explorer backend has the chain-grabber in it


[12/15/2021 9:49 PM] quokka#1273
The chaingrabber uses the explorer API to fill up a database of a all block info


[12/15/2021 9:56 PM] quokka#1273
I may be wrong


[12/15/2021 10:11 PM] Hamilton#4703
I see, so, the problem you're having is downloading all the data from the blockchain? Wasn't that suppose to be light? Sorry, I'm lost lol


[12/15/2021 10:16 PM] abchris#8522
The grabber use a node's api (not the explorer's) to fill a db. The explorer exposes that db's content through the explorer's api.


[12/15/2021 10:18 PM] abchris#8522
I don't know what to think anymore. I just spun up a empty db and started the grabber from scratch. If it is as slow as yours, then the grabber version is to blame.


[12/15/2021 10:19 PM] abchris#8522
I synced a while back, using an older grabber version. So that could explain the difference.


[12/15/2021 10:19 PM] quokka#1273
Yeah I think I‚Äôm just going to let it run for a few weeks. If it‚Äôs the chaingrabber version I might try an earlier one. Any version recommendations?


[12/15/2021 10:21 PM] abchris#8522
I was using 8.1.0 then had to switch to 9.3.3-HF which fix a blocking issue, recently switched to 9..4.3.


[12/15/2021 10:22 PM] abchris#8522
You can probably use 8.1.0 up to a certain height before running the issue that requires 9.3+


[12/15/2021 10:23 PM] Hamilton#4703
What would be the size of said database now?


[12/15/2021 10:24 PM] abchris#8522
In postgres it's over 50GB including indexes and all, but the compressed dump is around 13GB.


[12/15/2021 10:26 PM] abchris#8522
I'll see if I can make that db dump downloadable from ergo watch when I get the time. Need to read up on nginx settings.


[12/15/2021 10:32 PM] Hamilton#4703
I see, which brings me to the next question, 50GB is not that big, so why does it take days~weeks to get it?


[12/15/2021 10:32 PM] Hamilton#4703
I don't know if I'm missing blockchain knowledge or data knowledge lol


[12/15/2021 10:44 PM] abchris#8522
It shouldn't be that long. Was done in a bit more than 24 for me. The grabber queries data from the node through it's api, parses it, does al sorts of checks to deal with orphan blocks and forkings, then updates it's db. So normal for it to take some time, but not weeks as seen by others in here.


[12/15/2021 10:44 PM] abchris#8522
1 hour after starting a fresh sync it's at block 132k. Will keep ya posted.


[12/15/2021 10:45 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
here is my progress trajectory

[12/15/2021 10:46 PM] abchris#8522
So 1 day to reach ~280k?


[12/15/2021 10:46 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
current rate suggests I won't be completing for another 3 weeks and the block generation is going to surpass me that i can't even catch up


[12/15/2021 10:46 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
day 1 about 150k-180k


[12/15/2021 10:47 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
day 2 puts me at 280k-300k


[12/15/2021 10:47 PM] abchris#8522
I'm at 145k, not even 70 minutes in...


[12/15/2021 10:48 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
i'm probably not tracking progress correctly too


[12/15/2021 10:48 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
so it's not exactly 24hours but whenver i have the chnce i would record the number


[12/15/2021 10:49 PM] abchris#8522
You didn't know you'd have to : )


[12/15/2021 10:49 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
LOL right?


[12/15/2021 10:49 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
after day 3 i was like i should track more consistently


[12/15/2021 10:49 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
so it does start to taper off after 350k (coincides with what quokka experience)


[12/15/2021 10:55 PM] abchris#8522
I remember seeing a slow down too, but not at that scale


[12/15/2021 10:58 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
how long did it take you in previous version? no more than 4 days?


[12/15/2021 10:59 PM] abchris#8522
A bit over 24h iirc, height was under 600k I think, but still

[12/15/2021 11:00 PM] abchris#8522

[12/15/2021 11:09 PM] abchris#8522
We‚Äôre basically using the same jars, except mine run in docker

It is really nice and not confusing at all, that you, a scientist, do the job of what I was expecting to be the job of an analyst lol

No, I mean, I watched and read so much stuff about the difference between data Engineer/Scientist/Analyst


[12/16/2021 1:44 AM] Hamilton#4703
And I was expecting "viz the data and figure out the future" to be the analyst job haha


[12/16/2021 1:44 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
OHH yeah it depends on the company


[12/16/2021 1:45 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
at uber at least: eng manages the pipeline. scientist builds the models, predictions, and run simulations of what is possible (based on certain business constraints). analyst describe the world of what happened. all of them viz data in different ways


[12/16/2021 1:48 AM] Hamilton#4703
I see


[12/16/2021 1:48 AM] Hamilton#4703
That is quite what I expected


[12/16/2021 1:48 AM] Hamilton#4703
I just expected the viz to be kinda shared between scientist/analyst


[12/16/2021 1:48 AM] Hamilton#4703
But, usually when I think viz, I think dashboards


[12/16/2021 1:49 AM] Hamilton#4703
And that kinda makes me think it is more to the analyst side


[12/16/2021 1:49 AM] Hamilton#4703
but what you said makes sense


[12/16/2021 1:49 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
i mean you're not wrong. the dashboards are for "these are the set views". for scientist we use it to explore and diagnose the data (find outliers, relationships, etc). otherwise your models get F up thanks to a few errors or anomalies haha


[12/16/2021 1:50 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
often times you wont understand the data until you visulaize it first. if you want to break into data world get a good grasp of that. imo at least

13GB dump of grabber db at ~642200


[12/16/2021 4:00 AM] abchris#8522
Am guessing it requires an empty db (no grabber schema) since I didn't pass  `--data-only` to pg_dump.

i'm guessing `sudo -u postgres psql explorer < grabberdb.dmp` after truncating all existing tables (or a clean postgres install) ?


[12/16/2021 5:47 AM] abchris#8522
The dump is in postgres custom format so you have to use pg_restore


[12/16/2021 5:48 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
`pg_restore -h localhost explorer < grabberdb.dmp`

[12/16/2021 5:50 AM] abchris#8522
Have a look at the docs, am guessing something like pg_restore -d dbname grabberdb.dmp


[12/16/2021 5:50 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
yeah


[12/16/2021 5:50 AM] abchris#8522

yes sir thank you üôè


[12/16/2021 5:51 AM] abchris#8522
pg_restore is quite powerful, you can use it to convert the dmp to plain sql if you want to inspect it first, or tweak it


[12/16/2021 5:52 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
btw quick update: i was gone for about 3 hours and my block height moved from 400k to 402k so i dont know if it's an IP node issue ( i connected to kushti custom ip node)

even bitcoin rpi with 700gb or so takes a week at most


[12/16/2021 5:58 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
so i'm scratching my head


[12/16/2021 5:58 AM] abchris#8522
Well bitcoin in a week is just for a full node, right? Ergo full node is ~24h right now I guess.


[12/16/2021 5:59 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
oh right just node and not chain grabbing


[12/16/2021 5:59 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
you're right not apples to apples


[12/16/2021 6:07 AM] abchris#8522
If my attempt fails like yours, then my theory is this: so far the grabber's only purpose was to support the explorer. It was developed fairly early and the explorer db probably never had to sync from scratch since then - the explorer db just went through some migrations as the grabber evolved.
Now we're reaching a stage where the blockchain gets large enough that the node's API can't cope with the load from the grabber.
Just a theory so far, will see how this sync goes... But would make more sense than docker. Older version might still be factor too: grabber does more stuff than in earlier versions, so takes more time...

if you are running the OS from microsd that is probably the bottleneck since it will be swapping there. I benched 170-280MB/s transferring small and big files to ssd, 64bit kernel though, default 32bit was a little slower


[12/16/2021 7:58 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
hrmm maybe boot from SSD instead?


[12/16/2021 8:03 AM] andee#4722
works much better that way, sd card is fine for regular pi use cases but for stuff with a lot of disk IO I avoid them


[12/16/2021 8:03 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
ok i gotta figure that out without losing all the progress i've made thus far

Nice one! What's that big spike all about?

Also @Luivatra why can't I tip in this channel? :[


[12/16/2021 4:47 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
from https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/puell-multiple/

```The chart above highlights periods where the value of Bitcoin's issued on a daily basis has historically been extremely low (Puell Multiple entering green box), which produced outsized returns for Bitcoin investors who bought Bitcoin here. It also shows periods where the daily issuance value was extremely high (Puell Multiple entering red box), providing advantageous profit-taking for Bitcoin investors who sold here.```


[12/16/2021 4:51 PM] glasgowm#9381
So because there was a big spike from 0.40 - > 2.50 and directly before that miners held their profitability was much higher - if i'm interpreting right?


[12/16/2021 4:52 PM] abchris#8522

And ip of course, to map countries


[12/16/2021 4:54 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
you'll want to use the left axis since the right is for USD price. but essentially the spikes indicate points in time where coins entering market > historical average and it was financially sound for them to take profits


[12/16/2021 4:54 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
for the investors: sell above the red and buy at/below the green (not financial advice)

we'll being the first does have some privs. There was tons of battles of BTC too - but by the time these networks had built up btc had matured. New chains have to try and grow underneath that competing with big players

@abchris some tips about storing the data would be appreciated, I am considering using postgresql. But I am unsure about how to manage it, if I do queries to check if nodes already exist and if they do do I just update timestamp or do I just add everything and remove duplicates etc. separate from the crawler?


[12/16/2021 7:53 PM] abchris#8522

I'd use the ip's as primary keys and then use `insert ... on conflict update ...`. Simple way to keep latest known attribute of each ip. See <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-insert.html> for syntax.


[12/16/2021 9:12 PM] abchris#8522
When done updating that table after a crawl, use it to query nb of nodes seen recently and store that timestamped result in a second table.


[12/16/2021 9:17 PM] andee#4722
Thanks! Will share it with you after refactoring and actually having implemented the crawling. After getting a DB up and running I will start on the crawling


[12/16/2021 9:18 PM] andee#4722

if you click on "details" in pgadmin it should auto scroll to latest steps

but it sequentially populates each table and index from the .dmp file


[12/17/2021 12:00 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
you'll know it's working if you run a simple query like `select * max(height) from node_headers;`. if it gives a block height > 640k then you are fine

Most of the queries should be in the py files under the syncer directory.
SigmaUSD stuff is still 100% sql under db dir, but will be refactored under syncer at some point.


[12/17/2021 1:36 AM] g_w87#1147
is that part of the pg-restore process?


[12/17/2021 1:38 AM] g_w87#1147
like would i have them if i just restored your db?


[12/17/2021 2:28 AM] abchris#8522
Nope, the dump is only grabber data. Most of the things in the ergowatch schemas can be recreated in minutes, except for the metrics, takes a good 24h to recreate the whole history at daily intervals.


[12/17/2021 2:32 AM] g_w87#1147
Ok thanks, that‚Äôs what I guessed. And that sounds about right for the daily metric


[12/17/2021 2:39 AM] g_w87#1147
Would imagine those are kind of impossible to recreate as is if we‚Äôre restoring your database. Would need CG to append the data once it‚Äôs built to make it tenable?


[12/17/2021 2:44 AM] abchris#8522
There‚Äôs a python script that takes care of the CG data. It‚Äôll fetch whatever is missing for EW.


[12/17/2021 2:49 AM] g_w87#1147
Ok I think I‚Äôm following. Essentially bootstrap from block 642k from your .dmp file and then the py script is appending from that‚Ä¶ was thinking I would just grab an updated .dmp with new history, but we can just skip downloading all history independently from CG and start at 642k now‚Ä¶?


[12/17/2021 3:05 AM] abchris#8522
I‚Äôm not following üòÑ, what do you want to achieve?


[12/17/2021 3:06 AM] g_w87#1147
Hahaha sorry. The dmp file allows us to skip the hard part from CG?


[12/17/2021 3:07 AM] abchris#8522
No, no cg in there.


[12/17/2021 3:07 AM] g_w87#1147
Right, but could I start CG from block 642k to get current?


[12/17/2021 3:08 AM] abchris#8522
There‚Äôs many ways to use cg data, i only use price at the start of each day utc


[12/17/2021 3:08 AM] abchris#8522
Using the py script from EW?


[12/17/2021 3:09 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
They are two separate services


[12/17/2021 3:09 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
The .dmp is all block data specifically from chain grabber module


[12/17/2021 3:09 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
The CG data from EW is another service to load it into EW related schemes


[12/17/2021 3:10 AM] abchris#8522
Exactly


[12/17/2021 3:11 AM] g_w87#1147
Ok ok


[12/17/2021 3:11 AM] g_w87#1147
I guess I was using CG to describe the process of updating the database every block


[12/17/2021 3:12 AM] g_w87#1147
But starting from genesis block is taking people forever


[12/17/2021 3:12 AM] g_w87#1147
So what I was trying to describe was, could we take your dmp file and update it from the last block


[12/17/2021 3:13 AM] g_w87#1147
And skip blocks 1-642k


[12/17/2021 3:13 AM] abchris#8522
The grabber will append it, yes

You can give it a try, the schema is in the project. The indexes can be recreated from there.

Might also drop the entire ad proof table which no one will use.


[12/17/2021 10:58 PM] error#5683
If you‚Äôll be dropping the tables I guess, you also have to comment some things out/ remove them from the chain grabber so it doesn‚Äôt run into an error


[12/17/2021 11:00 PM] abchris#8522
Was thinking of using a trigger, but that might slow things even more. A custom grabber would certainly be useful

I‚Äòm not a scala dev, but I dived a little into the code and it‚Äòs pretty good structured, I think it can be modified to suit different scenarios/integrate extra tables and it is pretty performant also.

I‚Äôm assuming the 365 day avg was still pretty high after that first spike up?


[12/18/2021 12:36 AM] g_w87#1147
Or maybe you used a smaller moving avg?


[12/18/2021 12:51 AM] curbsideprophet#5083

I'd compare it against the hashrate


[12/18/2021 1:15 AM] glasgowm#9381
Hashrate has cycles not related to the market due to the delayed difficulty


[12/18/2021 1:17 AM] g_w87#1147
Interesting, I have seen on the mining Reddit they talk about trying to time the difficulty adjustment


[12/18/2021 1:19 AM] g_w87#1147
Would guess it‚Äôs also related to ergo being a smaller market cap project and was a reaction to bitcoin dropping


[12/18/2021 1:19 AM] glasgowm#9381
Not sure how you could time it, big dip in price causes a drip in profitability then a few painful weeks for miners

[12/18/2021 1:28 AM] g_w87#1147
I wonder if the puell needs to be factored by some rate if there are big differences


[12/18/2021 1:30 AM] glasgowm#9381
The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks based on the time it took to find the previous 2016 blocks. At the desired rate of one block each 10 minutes, 2016 blocks would take exactly two weeks to find. If the previous 2016 blocks took more than two weeks to find, the difficulty is reduced.

Rewards to miners didn‚Äôt change and 365 day avg was much higher during second peak‚Ä¶ but would‚Äôve expected the Puell to be higher given the 3-4x move in price

Bitcoin 10x‚Äôd in its second peak‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll just assume Erg is too young at this point to really read trends into puell? This double peak was 4-5 years after the genesis block so maybe not a great compare for where we are currently.


[12/18/2021 2:28 AM] glasgowm#9381
I assumed it was from the influx of new miners


[12/18/2021 2:28 AM] g_w87#1147
Actually take all that back, probably fine‚Ä¶ double peak was 10x from top, this was just back to the ATH


[12/18/2021 2:29 AM] g_w87#1147
Would that impact daily issuance to miners tho? That should be constant until Jan 22


[12/18/2021 2:56 AM] glasgowm#9381
Jan 22? Not sure I'm following. But if there's an influx of miners they'll have the benefit of a reduced difficulty the first few epochs so more coins per day issued


[12/18/2021 3:48 AM] g_w87#1147
January 2022‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs about when mining emissions go down


[12/18/2021 3:56 AM] g_w87#1147
Ok that‚Äôs interesting I thought emissions was 67.5 per block which was about every 2 min? Didn‚Äôt think difficulty had anything to do with emissions. Puell is daily miner emissions vs 1y avg price. If daily mining is fixed (for now) then what‚Äôs driving the multiple is the price or at least that was my assumption


[12/18/2021 4:02 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
It‚Äôs calculated by daily miner emission over 365 day average daily miner emission (not price)


[12/18/2021 4:04 AM] g_w87#1147

[12/18/2021 9:01 PM] andee#4722
low diff, plenty miners join, emission increases before diff increases

Didn‚Äôt know that! Good stuff


[12/18/2021 9:01 PM] g_w87#1147
Ok so that‚Äôs why in the beginning block time looked like a couple seconds


[12/18/2021 9:01 PM] andee#4722
diff increases, miners leave, leaving the loyal miners left with high diff and longer block times. longer block times equals longer between diff adjustments

If / when ETH miners migrate to ERG and hash rate goes up, what is expected to happen?

[12/18/2021 9:04 PM] andee#4722
diff adjustment is every ~34.1 hours at ideal block time, but can be +47 hours after a big amount of hash swept in and then left abruptly


[12/18/2021 9:04 PM] andee#4722
block time decreases

until diff catches up to nethash

So ~2 minutes should continue to be the block time but will fluctuate


[12/18/2021 9:12 PM] andee#4722
current diff = 1949000324349952 H ==  ~1949 TH. if current average block time was 60 seconds that would equal ~ `1949 / 60 = 32.48 TH/s`  nethash


[12/18/2021 9:13 PM] andee#4722
diff algo targets 2 minutes, so if block time goes to 80s because of large influx that leaves after diff increases block time will increase by roughly the same percentage that it dropped to keep the average at 120s

Say pass if too much, but interested in getting your opinion. Given nuances of Ergo‚Äôs emissions, how would you adjust Puell Multiple calculation?


[12/18/2021 9:30 PM] g_w87#1147
Seems like hash rate would accomplish same thing as emissions since one is a function of the other? - this is probably wrong, should look into it‚Ä¶

Enjoy your wine and melatonin!


[12/18/2021 9:36 PM] andee#4722
sorry but thats too much to read at this time of day, (and without reading too much) I dont see how it translates to Ergo, at least right now at current nethash

[12/18/2021 9:53 PM] andee#4722
hashrate without diff would make emission completely unpredctable

I'm getting Pg_restore errors still... first it was "missing ew schema" now it is "function ew.notify_new_header() does not exists" any ideas? @curbsideprophet


[12/19/2021 8:39 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
Is it breaking the pipeline ? Are you still getting new blocks to come in ?


[12/19/2021 8:39 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
Those are ergowatch functions and not part of chain grabber


[12/19/2021 8:40 PM] g_w87#1147

[12/19/2021 8:41 PM] curbsideprophet#5083

But try doing a fresh start dropping entire database


[12/19/2021 8:46 PM] g_w87#1147
Yeah starting fresh... it seems like the errors kill the restore but perhaps everything is fine before it shuts down

[12/20/2021 4:34 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
i'm still trying to make sense of it but the general idea: ERG send/receive relationship between different addresses


[12/20/2021 4:35 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
in this particular case honed in on a couple ERG mining farms


[12/20/2021 4:42 PM] Hamilton#4703
Oh I see


[12/21/2021 5:08 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
Good idea or no: run full ergo node on same RPi as chain-grabber?


[12/21/2021 5:09 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
or use a separate RPi for the node? trying to figure out how much storage i need (without buying another ssd lol)


[12/21/2021 5:38 PM] abchris#8522
Node will add about another 10GB. Think ram may be more of an issue. Try shutting the grabber down while the node catches up.


[12/21/2021 5:39 PM] abchris#8522
Is it a 4 or 8GB pi?


[12/21/2021 5:48 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
4gb


[12/21/2021 5:48 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
so what i'm hearing if i want to have a dedicated cpu to do all things ergo at a single location then definitely move off the pi


[12/21/2021 5:53 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
in other words: i want to ape into all ergo dev services lol (full node, chain grabber, ergodex tx bot, etc.)


[12/21/2021 6:10 PM] abchris#8522
Then dedicated pi it probably is. Though I don‚Äôt think anyone tried node + grabber on pi before ; )


[12/21/2021 6:14 PM] curbsideprophet#5083

[12/22/2021 8:36 AM] Platypus#2410
Looking at the metrics, wallet holders 1MM & 100k are stable/accumulating; and largest selling by 10k & 1k has resided it seems. 

However when looking at the distribution graphs of top 10 and top 100 addresses there's a linear decline. Do we have any idea who these entities are? Miners? It's just relentless selling everyday on the same pace


[12/22/2021 8:39 AM] Platypus#2410
This would imply there's addresses 100k-1MM spending, but still remaining >100k


[12/22/2021 8:40 AM] Platypus#2410
Interesting as they do not adjust the spending to price appreciation, in contrast to large entities in BTC, which sell into strength and hold/accumulate during weakness


[12/22/2021 8:42 AM] Platypus#2410
also this insane, and vertical accumulation does indicate to 1 (or at least a very concentrated group of) address(es) i think?

[12/23/2021 5:49 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
based on the whitepaper for miner emission schedule (page 12), it says that box should have a total of 93.41M $erg but I am only getting 85.05 $erg.... which makes it come up short by about 8.4m $erg


[12/23/2021 5:50 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
however i was able to replicate the treasury emission scale without a problem


[12/23/2021 6:21 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
```During blocks 525,600 - 590,399 (3 month), a
miner will be able to collect 66 Erg, and after that, the block reward
will be reduced by 3 Erg every 64,800 blocks (3 months) until it
reaches zero at block 2,080,799.``` 
based on this schedule, it is my understanding that by block `1,886,400` to `1,951,199` miner rewards come out to 3 per block. what happens at block `1,951,200` ? it wouldn't hit 0, would it? there are still 129,600 blocks before hitting the 0 miner rewards at block `2,080,799`. 

also, by block `1,951,200` the cumulative miner supply will be 84.67M which is 8,747,996 $erg away from max miner supply

[12/23/2021 6:36 AM] abchris#8522
Doesn‚Äôt sound right‚Ä¶


[12/23/2021 6:39 AM] abchris#8522
Emission is 75 ERG/block up to block 525599, then 72 for the next 64800, then 69 for the next 64800 and so on. At each block, anything above 67.5 ERG/block goes to the treasury and the rest goes to miners.


[12/23/2021 6:44 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
the above is straight from the whitepaper. it breaks it down into `miners` and `treasury`. so miners get 67.5 and treasury gets 7.5 for the initial 525599 blocks...that comes out to 75 erg/block


[12/23/2021 6:45 AM] abchris#8522
Yep


[12/23/2021 6:46 AM] abchris#8522
But `During blocks 525,600 - 590,399 (3 month), a miner will be able to collect 66 Erg` isn't right. Miner rewards are still at 67.5 right now.


[12/23/2021 6:47 AM] curbsideprophet#5083

To me, it looks like a mistake in the description. The 66 ERG/block for miners starts in Jan 2022 at block 655200.


[12/23/2021 7:03 AM] abchris#8522
And that's also when treasury emission come to an end (in practice treasury funds have been sitting in a contract and slowly unlocking, but boils down to the same).

Your miner_rewards at 655199 should be 67.5, then 66

[12/23/2021 9:20 AM] Platypus#2410
could very well be! but shouldn't we exclude the emission wallet/box from the top XXX? It is not a holder ie it cannot change the rate of emission/distribution


[12/23/2021 9:20 AM] blackinsecure#3693
maybe log scale is better for visualization? idk maybe worth a try


[12/23/2021 9:24 AM] abchris#8522
It is excluded. What I meant is that your graph was showing % of supply held by top addresses, which decreases, while the balance doesn‚Äôt.


[12/23/2021 9:30 AM] abchris#8522
For the x-axis you mean?


[12/23/2021 9:30 AM] blackinsecure#3693
and the y-axis on the left

also a label on x-axis to make clear it's block height

otherwise great job though


[12/23/2021 9:37 AM] Platypus#2410
my bad, also regarding switching to absolute view


[12/23/2021 11:37 AM] glasgowm#9381
This is an old version, apologies. The new one was on the git but nobody had moved it over. Just compiled and pushed there. (but will take a bit to update). This is the latest version.

If you feel at ease with sql, try dropping some of the indexes and restore them once you‚Äôre synced. If not, don‚Äôt worry about it, will just take a bit longer to reach current height.

[01/09/2022 6:30 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
@abchris by any chance you know how we define ergo miners? here's a miner address inside the `blocks_info` table: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/addresses/88dhgzEuTXaRxf1rbqBRZ6Zbw9iigdB4PCdjyFKLrk22gnmjKcxZBe53vqJVetRa4tTNF9oowQWPp2c6


[01/09/2022 6:32 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
is my understanding correct: there is no way a miner (solo or pool) could send their ERGO directly to a `9XXetc` address but has to go through the `88dhgXXetc` first?


[01/09/2022 8:41 AM] andee#4722
you are correct, block rewards go to 88* addresses where the funds are locked for 720 blocks before they can spend


[01/09/2022 8:56 AM] abchris#8522
Cheers Andee. So in the case of a mining pool, after the 720 blocks, the reward would go to an address belonging to that pool and then get distributed to individual miners of that pool, right?


[01/09/2022 8:57 AM] abchris#8522
Or could a pool claim the rewards directly to their miners addresses?


[01/09/2022 8:57 AM] abchris#8522
Cause that's what this tx looks like <https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/23f96f3701c1a17d697a5a5d504a2bc5be10cff3312aa5f7b23832c641bf92db>


[01/09/2022 8:58 AM] andee#4722
reward stays in the 88* address until they use the box in a transaction, I have seen some pools spend from 9* addresses in payouts too though


[01/09/2022 9:00 AM] abchris#8522
Gotcha. In the latter case rewards would have been claimed to that 9* address first then.


[01/09/2022 9:00 AM] andee#4722
its probably their "savings" üôÇ especially pools that do payouts before 720block confirmations needs a buffer


[01/09/2022 9:01 AM] abchris#8522
Ooof... that's not making it any simpler üôÇ


[01/09/2022 9:02 AM] andee#4722
Hehe, no üòÖ  I know leafpool bought erg to do faster payouts


[01/09/2022 9:11 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
nice thank you for that


[01/09/2022 9:12 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
so to (roughly) figure out miner holding vs sell pressure:
1) identify miners through `88*` > `9*` transfers
2) sell defined as: from `9*` > `known CEX` transfers
3a) hold defined as: from `9*` > `9*` transfers
3b) hold also defined as: staying in `9*` address


[01/09/2022 6:14 PM] abchris#8522
Thing is the only cex addresses we know are main ones, not those where individuals would transfer to. So, for know, I‚Äôd just skip 2)


[01/09/2022 6:44 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
yup i figured that would be the case.

although thinking about it some more 3a) may not always be true since: mining pools would be `88*` > `9*` (mining pool address) > `9*` individual miner payout address


[01/09/2022 6:48 PM] abchris#8522
Indeed


[01/09/2022 11:56 PM] andee#4722
pools usually pay directly from the reward address, the 9 address which sometimes is included as input is probably their change address


[01/11/2022 7:30 AM] Kurikun#6941
Hi stats crew, I've got an early version of the node reporting app that I mentioned about 2 weeks ago online at https://ergo.nodespyder.io.  Since you are all fellow analytics nerds, would love to have any feedback you have to share. There's also an API on the site if any of you need some node-specific data for your analysis.

[01/12/2022 9:09 PM] abchris#8522
That's just the number of nodes with an open p2p port (9030 usually). A lot of nodes will be running on a home network, which has most if not all ports closed by default.


[01/12/2022 9:19 PM] MarantzCube#4825
Oah, thanks üòÖ . Has anyone estimated the approximate number of all nodes?  ~1000?


[01/12/2022 9:22 PM] MarantzCube#4825
Example from bitnodes.io: 
Bitcoin ... Reachable nodes as of Wed Jan 12: 14988


[01/12/2022 10:35 PM] Kurikun#6941
The "total" number of nodes is way less than 1000.  When @andee and I were both doing scans that included nodes reported via PeerList messages, we were seeing about 265-270 nodes.

The problem with PeerList-reported nodes is that nodes can stay on the list for some time, even if they're not really operating.  I currently have 4 nodes that appear on the PeerList list, but none of them have been operating since approx Jan 2 2022, yet they are still reported as running.

If PeerList was more current, I could consider using that.  But as it is, I can only trust nodes that I can handshake with.


[01/12/2022 10:36 PM] Kurikun#6941
And yes, so the "80" that I report are the equivalent of the "reachable" total above, since anyone can connect to them.


[01/13/2022 1:57 AM] MarantzCube#4825
Thanks for answering. Hmmm 265-270 nodes...

I think the total number of nodes +-10% including "unreacheble"/local nodes is also point of interest (for decentralisation talks).

For straight bitcoin forks (in the case of "passive scanning"), it was enough to parse peers.dat files from 5-10 nodes during the week or two. +-/10% tolerance, yeah üòÑ. I don't know if it's possible to do something like this for ergo (cos I can't sync node ü§™).


[01/14/2022 9:18 AM] KuantumWinter#1976
Hi @abchris , just saw this data https://whalemap.io/ for Bitcoin and thought you might be interested in it. I will look into more when I have time but could be cool to have something like this for ERG.

Maybe you can share address_balance.csv? I think It's better to cut=filter 1 erg peak (it's dust on wallets) and whales (how many of them there? 10-30?) on the right. So we will see more realistic mean and median (about 50 erg as I guess).

It seem that about 9k addresses (out of 232339 = 0.04%) has negative cumulative balance because not all 'diff' are in csv file.
I think transactions with same data (date/sum/diff) were not included in the file. Maybe because of some filter "no_duplicates" (see spoiler).

||Let's play on example of '9gpUBRrgBrBZNT5ku86ZM2JRHnCKHWmd2NrKvxtdQmteV21WP6g':

1) Count of transactions in spesific wallet (in csv):
grep '9gpUBRrgBrBZNT5ku86ZM2JRHnCKHWmd2NrKvxtdQmteV21WP6g' -ic wallet_balance.csv
12

2) +dates and diffs (to compare with explorer data):
grep '9gpUBRrgBrBZNT5ku86ZM2JRHnCKHWmd2NrKvxtdQmteV21WP6g' -i wallet_balance.csv
9gp...P6g,2020-02-13,-0.001

4522.503
4590.001

3) address data on explorer:
https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/addresses/9gpUBRrgBrBZNT5ku86ZM2JRHnCKHWmd2NrKvxtdQmteV21WP6g

Final balance: 0
No. transactions: 37

4522.502
4522.503
4590.001
4657.5
4724.999

You can see that 3b) list == 2a) list.
So we can conclude that transactions (lines) with same data (date/sum/diff) were not included in the file.
Maybe because of some filter "no_duplicates". This filter could affect any of the addresses (==> final balance). So it is necessary to recheck and regenerate the csv file.||


[01/15/2022 1:03 PM] MarantzCube#4825
I can work with that csv (will cut buggy addresses) while you prepare right one.


[01/15/2022 4:20 PM] curbsideprophet#5083

[01/15/2022 6:29 PM] MarantzCube#4825
I think what peaks near 0.1, 0.2, ... 0.9, 1.0 (+0.75, 0.85) Erg are:

**1. "pools min payouts"**
Low hashrate miners with one weak videocard.
They mine weeks before the first-second payout and quit. 

*Data from miningpoolstats.stream/ergo*
1) the biggest ergo pool is nanopool with min payout of 1.0 erg.
We see there a highest peak of 2000 addresses.

2) second biggest pool is herominers with min payout of 0.5 erg.
We see there a second highest peak of 600+400 addresses (two bins near).

3) flypool min payout is 0.1 erg (?)

And so on. See screenshot.

**2. "round numbers"**
People like round numbers, so peaks also consists of those small roundy (test?) transactions to (friends?).


**Leftmost peak near 0.0 is dust**

So my conclusion is 
Dust        -  balance from 0+  to 0.1  -  163,038  (upd: ERR here, must be 33k, see later posts)
Plankton -  balance from 0.1 to 1.0  -  7535

[01/15/2022 6:54 PM] abchris#8522
There's only around 90k addresses with unspent boxes at the moment


[01/15/2022 6:55 PM] abchris#8522
Seems a lot of dust is generated by the current V1 oracle pools: `9fQHnth8J6BgVNs9BQjxj5s4e5JGCjiH4fYTBA52ZWrMh6hz2si` for instance has 16k boxes with 0.00025 ERG each.


[01/15/2022 6:55 PM] MarantzCube#4825
These peaks near 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 also could be pools payouts. We'll see later.

Every metric seems to be that way, by their description @quokka


[01/17/2022 4:48 PM] quokka#1273
I meant the db blocks on the top left of the site


[01/17/2022 4:49 PM] quokka#1273
But if the metrics update every 24 hours I wonder what else the DB is used for


[01/17/2022 4:49 PM] quokka#1273
since the db sync is always 1 block behind


[01/17/2022 4:51 PM] Hamilton#4703
Well, in this case, we would need confirmation from Chris


[01/17/2022 7:15 PM] abchris#8522
For things updated at the block level (oracle pools, sigmausd, and tx and volume metrics), it is probably about a minute behind.
The grabber polls the node every 15secs, so worst case it picks up a block 15 secs later. Then ergo watch does its stuff, which takes around 10 secs usually but can be more. So assume it's 1 minute behind.


[01/17/2022 7:17 PM] abchris#8522
For the 24h metrics, it updates when the first block of a day (UTC time) is available, but it'll wait for an additional 10 blocks to be confirmed on top that just to be sure, so actual update time is more around 12:20 am UTC.


[01/17/2022 7:19 PM] abchris#8522
I could reduce the update interval, but the current approach is based on snapshots which take several minutes to generate. Add on top of that that you need to regenerate all snapshots as soon as you add/remove an exchange address, and you know why it's only doing it at 24h intervals.


[01/17/2022 7:22 PM] abchris#8522
Am working on a new backend that'll have metrics at block level and will allow to add/remove exchange addresses on the fly, but not quite there yet.

Thanks sm!!! That was really helpful

Guess who is still postponing setting up stuff? (work as been annoying), but is it possible to grab the "voting parameter" to see how the voting for EIP-27 is going?


[01/18/2022 5:51 PM] abchris#8522
Been looking into it. The yellow paper in the ergo repo has a good section on voting.

Looks like we have to track some key/value pairs in the block extension. It seems the chain grabber doesn‚Äôt include its contents in the db, only the hash. Only way I found was to request a block through the node api, that gives you the whole extension for a given block.

It is something I‚Äôll include in EW v2, but might not be ready for EIP27.


[01/18/2022 6:11 PM] abchris#8522
But for non soft fork votes, i think it is enough to track that little voting section in the block headers - iirc. You can see them on the explorer.

In addition to the explorer api, you can use the node api, here's one from one of the public nodes: <http://213.239.193.208:9053/swagger>

[01/20/2022 10:45 PM] abchris#8522
Nice one @quokka !
Only comment I have is about the top10 holdings. Chances are there are exchange addresses in there (we don't track TradeOgre, FMFW.io, bitcoin.com, and some others I forgot about). You mention Coinex liquidity is declining, so the top10 decline might as well be due to untracked exchanges.
Exchange tracking will be improved in the coming months, till then gotta do with what we have.
Also, last sentence of second paragraph, `no` should be `now`.

There will be many such events. Then, for example, in six months, data analysts from this chat will not remember what event led to what. So, consolidation into a calendar is needed.

Hey fellow ergo-statters @here. 

If you want to take a look at the https://rankmywallet.com preview, simply login with user `ergo` and password `101`.

The app is fully functional and ready to ship with one exception; `rank` and `balance` are currently randomly generated numbers until
I can connect to a good source, database or API.

All feedback  welcomed but please do not share widely until it is released.


[01/28/2022 11:52 AM] bravo-kernel#1551
**Request 1: **I know that some people are already working on wallet + balance overviews. If I can join forces or receive pointers to save me from reinventing the wheel that would be highly appreciated.


[01/28/2022 11:55 AM] bravo-kernel#1551
**Request 2: ** I would also really appreciate some help in establishing Ergo species, as shown here https://rankmywallet.com/species. For now, I have taken the exact same species as used for Cardano but changed the amounts. Nothing more than a first concept, I would like to hear what parts are (un)realistic.

they have been doing a lot of work on that recently both front and backend

The dashboard we have does the same thing, however it's going to the explorer API


[01/28/2022 5:16 PM] Marty#4039
We are refactoring it so it uses our own node to query the blockchain


[01/28/2022 5:17 PM] Marty#4039
It's a bit expensive to get a server online that runs a node, because you need 8gb of ram typically, so easiest to just pull from explorer, but slower and sometimes (like today) it goes down and you just have to wait

@abchris awesome, I would have no issue using (or paying a reasonable fee) for an API that gives me (1) the total number of mainnet P2K addresses/accounts (2) balance for each account(3) the sorted-by-balance database index (which would basically determine the rank) (4) number of accounts per species as a bonus


[01/28/2022 5:49 PM] bravo-kernel#1551
I can assist working on the API as well, no problem


[01/28/2022 5:50 PM] bravo-kernel#1551
Ideally, the wallet ranking site will not use a database of its own, simply consume APIs


[01/28/2022 5:53 PM] bravo-kernel#1551
I understand sorting and realtime could be a challenge but... that's what we do right. A snapshot-based solution would also work for me as intermediate solution

Assuming you have 1, 3 and 4, would you still need 2? Cause that sounds like a lot of data to query on a regular basis.

Nice work!  Love the design UI approach.

Do you have some issues with the culture settings for numbers?  I'm EN-us, and I'm seeing a number with periods for number separators.  But I don't see that across all numbers.

If you folks, who have way more insight in ergo data, could look at the species one day, perhaps we as a channel can set the standard. If I am not wrong, currently there is no such categorization


[01/28/2022 6:01 PM] bravo-kernel#1551
Just FYI there are some hidden features in the app. For example, even though testnet and non-P2PK addresses trigger an error, they do get analyzed. Fun stuff for those who try to figure out how these addresses are made up.


[01/28/2022 6:05 PM] curbsideprophet#5083

It's KuCoin doing internal transfers, here's an example: <https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/1153d4987e3d02dc6c79dbd4bf38734436b6bbf163c19f12d168e742c8ee02a0>

is the kucoin internal transfers also the reason for the big dip in mean coin age?

@abchris I have also put in some placeholder properties for the actual ranking. Available through the devtools as well and... I think you were right, it looks like no balance is needed. I think the following would suffice:

Perhaps a timestamp of the snapshot if realtime sorting is impossible or too hard/resource consuming


[02/01/2022 8:52 PM] abchris#8522
It‚Äôll be real time. Am assuming you‚Äôd like to know the balance of the next/prev address as well, or do you plan on fetching that from the explorer?


[02/01/2022 8:53 PM] bravo-kernel#1551
I was thinking about that and making an extra call would be no problem. However, ideally the (nano)balance of next/prev would be included of course (in a dream world) üòâ

Another view at nodes counting.

Finally I collected enough data from the node (~10 days, ~12 GB logs üòÖ).

You all know that in node's logs we can see IPs of peers. So everyone easily can grep this data.


I chose three types of log lines with peer data:
[see explanation.png]

**1) time / IP:port / node name**
05:34:17.349 INFO  [ctor.default-dispatcher-7] s.c.n.NetworkController - 
Connecting to peer:PeerInfo(PeerSpec(
ergoref,4.0.21,ergo-mainnet-4.0.21.1,Some(/172.31.0.247:9020),
Vector(ModeFeature(utxo,true,None,-1))),0,None)

**2) time / IP:port**
05:34:41.490 DEBUG [ctor.default-dispatcher-7] s.c.n.PeerConnectionHandler - 
Received message MessageSpec(65: Sync) from ConnectionId
(remote=/54.36.166.159:9030, local=/127.0.0.1:32000, direction=Outgoing)

**3) time / peers count in local's node DB**
06:12:34.147 INFO  [ctor.default-dispatcher-7] s.c.n.peer.
PeerManager - 223 peers read from the database

[02/03/2022 3:30 PM] MarantzCube#4825
I will point out that **no checks for peer availability are performed.**
We just stating a connection attempt at such IP.


So, grep in 12 Gb logs give ~500Mb *.csv with ~11M lines like this:
--
date_time;ip;port;node_name
2022-01-28 12:12:00.356;54.37.236.119;9030;None;
2022-01-28 12:13:11.045;173.196.49.171;9030;ergoref,4.0.19,ergo-mainnet-4.0.19;
2022-01-28 12:25:34.465;136.244.110.145;9030;ergoref,3.3.6,ergo-mainnet-4.0.0;
2022-01-28 12:28:52.135;82.0.17.171;9030;ergoref,4.0.19,ergo-mainnet-4.0.19;
--
For further analysis seconds/milliseconds not needed.
Cutting and sorting with "unique" option lead to ~25Mb *.csv with ~500k lines.

How can we get the estimated number of IPs (nodes) from this data? If we will cyclically shift a window with time-size of 24h (day) by 1 hour over the entire range and count unique IP in this window... We will get a number of "unique IP per day" for every hour.

Well, let's make a graph.

[02/03/2022 3:36 PM] MarantzCube#4825
Of course, it is better to do something similar with data from node DB (\peers\ folder). But I haven't figured out how to parse *.ldb files yet.


[02/04/2022 11:51 AM] MarantzCube#4825
Here's a more correct one 

Nuances:
1) If we assume the worst case, when each private IP must have its own external (public) IP, then for the assessment we can't rely on the "all ip" graph line but on "public ip".
In reality, there may be several private IPs behind one public IP. So node count is in between "public ip" and "all ip" graph lines.
It +/- corresponds with "N peers read from the database" graph line.

2) To *.csv was added column "accessible"
IP is marked as accessible if there is "Received message" in log line.

Example:
--
08:45:12.544 DEBUG [tor.default-dispatcher-1] s.c.n.PeerConnectionHandler - Received message MessageSpec(12: Sync) from ConnectionId(remote=/51.38.53.121:9030
--

Now you can see "accessible ip" on graph which corresponds with https://ergo.nodespyder.io/ data:  ~60-80 nodes online per day.

[02/04/2022 12:27 PM] MarantzCube#4825
Earlier, I cut off the data until January 25th because my node was unstable.

But there is an interesting point in January 20-22. Look at the number of private IPs and how it is halving dramatically in two days.

[02/04/2022 3:33 PM] Platypus#2410
still reshuffling? the age keeps dropping past days, but angle of drop is too much for it to be sell of


[02/04/2022 3:35 PM] Platypus#2410
at the same time supply on coinex seems increasing quite a bit


[02/04/2022 8:11 PM] abchris#8522
Yeah, Kucoin is still doing their thing, here's the latest tx: <https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/3ca2597d7a03bc09b9bf85a26053533589e1d78123a06d603b114d6e1950d295>

You've got a point that age is declining sharply. Kucoin's txs account for most of the daily volume, so you'd think they wouldn't impact age so much after their first txs... ü§î


[02/04/2022 8:11 PM] abchris#8522
Actually, the way mean age is calculated here doesn't track individual addresses. It just looks at transfer volume vs circulating supply basically. So, if you move 45M ERG, in single tx or in 45 txs of 1M within a day or so, "mean age" would be near zero.


[02/04/2022 8:42 PM] abchris#8522
Age will keep dropping if Kucoin doesn't stop their daily shuffle. EW v2 will track individual addresses, which will fix that.

You'd think they would've turned them back on by now...


[02/05/2022 8:37 AM] MarantzCube#4825
Why? I see that people keep complaining about yoroi sync in chats. Plus I do not see a recovery in the number of private IPs after falling from 175 to 75.


[02/05/2022 8:58 AM] abchris#8522
Yoroi's always had issues with dusty wallets. Just saying that, assuming they did a massive shutdown of nodes, I'd expect them to be back up now. Also, it would mean Yoroi's running like half of all Ergo nodes out there. I don't think they'd need that much to provide the "services" they provide.
It might just be an artefact in the data you collected. Regardless, it's a clever way to look at it, so keep sharing your reports, curious to see if it all goes back to ~ 500.


[02/05/2022 9:50 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yoroi doesn't have any nodes. The problem is they were using one of ours

Yes, it's kind of an artifact. 

It seems that on January 19-20 my grabber received peerlist from a node (176.9.104.149) restored from an old backup (with old IP list).

Over 180 IPs from "peak of 500+ nodes" occur only in context add-remove to-from peer DB:

[02/16/2022 5:46 AM] error#5683
Some background about that: Each Ergodex liquidity pool is actually a box guarded by one of two Ergodex contracts. Each time an order/trade takes place, that box is spent with the modified pool values resulting in a new price. Through the global_index of these boxes you get a snapshot of the pool values/pair prices over time.

[02/16/2022 5:35 PM] error#5683
This ergotree is one of the contracts, the N2T contract to be precise,  in serialized form. It guards all Erg pairs/boxes (erg-sigusd, erg-ergopad,‚Ä¶) so every time you make a order in erg on ergodex the corresponding box of the pair from this contract will be spent and a new one created with new values based on the amm formula.


[02/16/2022 5:36 PM] SoCool#6419
Ah so I'm retrieving the latest N2T swap pool liquidity box?


[02/16/2022 5:37 PM] SoCool#6419
and as I dug around in the ergodex code - N2T and T2T were non-obvious acronyms to me but as I've been playing with this stuff more I'm thinking now it's native (ergo) to token, vs token (sigUSD or whatever other token) to token ?


[02/16/2022 5:38 PM] SoCool#6419
<--- bad at reading documentation, I always go straight to reading the code


[02/16/2022 5:38 PM] error#5683
N2T = native to token (erg - something else), T2T = token to token (sigusd-sigrsv)


[02/16/2022 5:39 PM] error#5683
If you want to understand the contracts, search the eip for ergodex. It‚Äôs all explained in there. Let me check if I can find quick

Added market value in erg with the token amount in the box there - live updates the values every 10 seconds (will shift to a minute) and has a bunch of historical data (don't have market data stored for everything) https://jimmyhoffa.github.io/ergo-market-charts/


[02/17/2022 1:30 AM] SoCool#6419
I think my market values are wrong but I got the bones of what I want, now I just need to dig into the source of that data closer, ergamount from that guarded box isn't the whole pool I guess


[02/17/2022 11:50 AM] SoCool#6419
Updated it: Now it will store the data in your browser local storage as it retrieves data over time. Also updated the seed data with my latest recording. Only stores data points where market value or price have changed compared to previous so it shouldn't bloat local storage (1200 data points right now accounting for almost 10 days of data changes)


[02/17/2022 11:51 AM] SoCool#6419
SigUSD market value is apparently unchanged for the most part (I don't have market value in the seed data going back very far) which is why it shows up as just a dot heh


[02/17/2022 3:52 PM] SoCool#6419
and now market cap values are right. I think that's enough for just monitoring the swap pools


[02/17/2022 3:56 PM] SoCool#6419
Next to make it analyze an address to track swaps and chart the swap performance.. "Is my NETA worth more than when I bought it, or less?" being the question to try and make visual..


[02/17/2022 3:57 PM] SoCool#6419
Speaking of NETA it just leapt up a bit heh, someone just made a big buy of it

@esot321c It creates an environment where we go through a mining profitability reset. 

The puell multiple offers some insight. Short term most likely painful. As an ecosystem we need to focus on building and delivering network value.

@curbsideprophet finally found this, I was looking for the channel earlier and guess I had not enabled all the emoji's in ecosystem until now, anyway...

I use ergowatch weekly for accounting and use a specific block height to track SigUSD price, for me to find the price of Erg I first have to go to the explorer and find out what time the block was produced and then I can use the time on the ergowatch charts to find the price.
so was wondering if at the bottom of the charts along with the time being displayed as the price changes for sigUSD if also the block height could be displayed? 
iirc the blockheight was at one time supported?

You can make issues in the repo if easier. There's some other stuff in the pipeline, but depending how complex it is I can probably fit it in somwhere.

Ok sure, I think Ill have a look at the repo and most likely write out the calls needed for each stat. Not super high priority for me right now, but will do when I get a chance over the next few weeks


[07/25/2022 5:43 AM] abchris#8522
Cool. I'm not using the explorer, so doesn't have to be actual explorer api calls, just what addresses to look into and how to interpret txs.

So Nodes in ergonodes.net == nodes with public IP. But are they really "accesible"?


[07/28/2022 7:49 AM] MarantzCube#4825
This means that now the number of accesible nodes is the same +/- as in February ~70. But the total number of nodes increased by 2-3 times.

@Platypus So far, it is still just me working on EW as a side project. I try not to spam the dev updates too much and only post important milestones.

The new api is still being worked on but getting there. Here's what's next:
- Add existing metrics to new api (in progress)
- Add sigmausd data to new api
- Add oracle pools v1 to new api
- Migrate website to new api
- Add new stuff to website

One useful metric would be the number of unique addresses in a transaction. This will show how much assets changed hands in the transaction and will cover both fan-in and fan-out transactions. At the same time, dust collection will have a single address and the metric = 1.

[03/03/2023 4:13 PM] quokka#1273
Definitely a good idea. Only issue is that setting up the data environment is very difficult. I‚Äôm assuming ergo watch has their own explorer database and it‚Äôs hard to set one up locally


[03/03/2023 9:08 PM] morphic#4133
yes, we need to have a metric which will measure of how much something useful happened in a transaction (let's call it #CHANGE). This will serve as an alternative to transactions/sec and we can say #CHANGE/sec. Such defined #CHANGE is closer to Ethereum's GAS (In Ethereum, gas is a measure of the computational effort required to execute a transaction or contract, which is proportional to the number of different balances updated during transaction). 
Thus, huge fan-out airdrop transaction can have #CHANGE=10000, confirmed in 2 minutes and cost only 0.1 ERG. This will let us to say something like 10000 / 120 = 83 CHANGE/sec and 0.00001 ERG/CHANGE
It would be interesting to watch how much changes happen on Ergo blockchain over time. @abchris


[03/06/2023 12:10 AM] abchris#8522
@morphic nice, I see. So it's a matter of defining change or useful change. Just looking at changed erg balances for instance, over the last 24h we have an average of 6.5 addresses changed per tx and a max of 347.


[03/06/2023 12:11 AM] abchris#8522
We could also consider token balance changes (likely to be captured by ERG balance changes as well), register value changes etc.


[03/06/2023 12:13 AM] abchris#8522
I guess tracking the average over time would be interesting as well as a top 100 of most changing txs. Is that what you had in mind?


[03/06/2023 12:21 AM] abchris#8522
EW doesn't rely on the explorer anymore. It's just a single exe. All you have to do is point it to a node and a postgres db  - and be patient üôÇ
You could also just access the live db through Azorus or promise you'll behave and I can make you an account on superset.ergo.watch. Thing is still a bit slow though and I'd rather sort a few things out before that, but yeah, having more folks poke at it would be great.


[03/06/2023 9:12 AM] morphic#4133
yes, exactly


[03/06/2023 12:55 PM] glasgowm#9381
Sure it'd get funded, happy to help push if someone organises one. Maybe #sigma-subscriptions can help in the near future for consistent funding
