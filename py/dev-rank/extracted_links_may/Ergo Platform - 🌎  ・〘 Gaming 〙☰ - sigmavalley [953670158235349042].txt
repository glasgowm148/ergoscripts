while it was genius in the beginning, now it's just people scream at clouds and thinking something will happen.  That was the 'short' squeeze. Hearings have been had. People got played other people got bailed out. They should just find a new target


[03/22/2022 6:34 PM] Maarten_V#0000
See who shorts what, see if it is for the right reason or not. And if not, you break them again and keep doing that over and over

ok I got a Q. are the people bidding on the second hand plot accruing valleyDAO with their bids? or only on initial mint?


[03/22/2022 11:11 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
I would imagine initial only. Otherwise the team would be busy tracking 2nd hand auctions all day at some point in the future.

Ok, ok, I might have a solution for voting. without smart contracts. (in a meanwhile, before we get real solutions from ErgoPad and anon_real). Here is it:
1. We create a poll. 
2. The voter connect with her wallet
3. If she has any ValleyDAO she peak the UTXOs that she want to vote with and make a vote
4. We save the boxID/vote/token amount in the DB (old style, before blockchain era db).
5. The Utxo is not locked in smart contract, so user can spend it, but if she does - we will just not count it in the final results
6. When calculating the final result - we go over all BoxIds that used for vote and check the balance, if nothing changed we count it in, of not - ignore
What do you think? Will it work? What are possible hacks?

My only technical hurdle is that dao isn‚Äôt necessarily in its own box and sometimes we have no control over how and when a box gets spent.


[03/25/2022 10:15 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
I‚Äôd say for an early vote a vote from an account holding dao is enough, spent after or not. It‚Äôs not a very volatile asset and we just hold it.

it's impossible.
smart contracts don't allow that.
the only time you could that, it's when the bid transaction fail , 
if the bid it's placed, it's impossible.

If you‚Äôre still trying to get the erg back it‚Äôs impossible. I overbid once by accident and the Smart contract only returns what the bid should have been, so the difference was lost forever.

Dunno but I‚Äôm tempted to add dickbutt or something to the back of my billboard.

A SigmaValley newspaper would be cool


[04/01/2022 3:29 PM] JOFLITO#0000
like, today in SigmaValley some guy added a cool lobster and a voodoo whale


[04/01/2022 3:29 PM] JOFLITO#0000
this prompted Miechy sir to put a dickbutt on the back of his billboard

Is it color or texture?


[04/02/2022 5:00 PM] koutelier#0000
color? made it with paint 3d


[04/02/2022 5:00 PM] koutelier#0000
windows program


[04/02/2022 5:00 PM] nirvanush#0000
@FidgetyRat should know, he has a lot of textures and was able to keep the size small


[04/02/2022 5:10 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Textures are hard In low size exports. My stone texture is just a small 128x128 normal map with underlying materials applied and it‚Äôs reused. That alone is like 120k


[04/02/2022 5:11 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
In blender I‚Äôd ensure that materials are reused. You don‚Äôt want to see ‚Äúred.050‚Äù etc. all faces using red should be using the same material mapping otherwise it‚Äôll export all of them into the glb even if they represent identical colors


[04/02/2022 5:11 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Then exporting in blender you can turn off a bunch of the model export features, enable compression, export visible only etc.


[04/02/2022 5:15 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Based on that fire it looks like that app just texture mapped and probably a high resolution mapping including normals, colors, etc. each layer being an individual large size image


[04/02/2022 5:16 PM] koutelier#0000
so this file can't get smaller


[04/02/2022 5:16 PM] koutelier#0000
we need to re paint it ?


[04/02/2022 5:18 PM] koutelier#0000
when i importing this to blender and then export it it has no color


[04/02/2022 5:25 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Unfortunately To get it truly small you‚Äôd need to define a few color materials and paint them manually on the polygons in blender. Since we dont know what the other program is actually doing.

[04/02/2022 5:27 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
So this bird is one single mesh but 4 materials applied to individual polygons. Adding the entire bird feeder didn‚Äôt even noticeably increase file size at all.


[04/02/2022 5:27 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
No textures or images.


[04/02/2022 5:29 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
The stone texture on the bath itself is the same texture used on other stone objects so no file size increase due to reuse


[04/02/2022 5:32 PM] koutelier#0000
> *(re @FidgetyRat)*: So this bird is one single mesh but 4 material... 
our statue is only one material i thing so if i try to change the colour it changes the whole statue colour . i don't know how to use blender though so maybe i am wrong


[04/02/2022 5:34 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
That‚Äôs fine. You add another material slot then select individual poly and ‚Äúapply‚Äù the second material

There‚Äôs a section at the bottom of that link for multiples


[04/02/2022 5:39 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
And when you do add a material don‚Äôt get too fancy. Glb doesn‚Äôt support almost any blender feature such as shader nodes, sub colors etc. stick with the default and set a color. Roughness and specular work but just control shininess.

I am though insanely curious about the why!


[04/02/2022 6:18 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
Making up scenarios in my mind all the time. Something that adds to the mystery and intrigue is that the pool before had the Cardano logo, which then changed to the Ergo logo. I need to know!

It comes out of a time where ergo was influenced with price action by a certain whale


[04/02/2022 11:32 PM] Maarten_V#0000
The community stood up against him and bought him out of coinex


[04/02/2022 11:32 PM] Maarten_V#0000
then the same whale tryed to break the sigmausd contract


[04/02/2022 11:33 PM] Maarten_V#0000

It‚Äôs 10M with one decimal


[04/04/2022 2:39 PM] nirvanush#0000
So it‚Äôs 1M but you can pay 1.5 for example


[04/04/2022 2:39 PM] nirvanush#0000
It handled on ergo as x10 more tokens


[04/04/2022 2:42 PM] gluca3#0000
Sorry I really do not understand that. Are there existing 1 million Valley DAO tokens or 10 million? If I buy 1000 Valley Dao on Ergodex will it be possible for 1000 or 10000 people to own 1000 Valley Dao tokens.

It‚Äôs 10M that presented on wallet as 1M with one decimal


[04/04/2022 2:47 PM] nirvanush#0000
So if you see in your wallet or on ergodex 10 tokens it technically means 100 tokens


[04/04/2022 3:12 PM] gluca3#0000

I think that's part of the beauty of being a landowner. You can even make profit off of your plot. It's yours. So as you could rent today from @FidgetyRat or whoever else may be interested, you could rent yours out too, if you bought one.


[04/04/2022 6:00 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
If you want to advertise something you can always rent the billboard or the airplane banner. Or, come to think of it, @FidgetyRat's billboard- but Idk if he's renting it out now, he's embroiled in the Lobster Wars.

Did you manage to get any plots?


[04/04/2022 7:05 PM] SamuelHeins#0000
No plots, the whale person won all the land.  I bid on all plots over and over till each one was around 150 ERG and then I stopped because I had 150 bid on like 3 land plots and I just wanted 1 land plot


[04/04/2022 7:06 PM] SamuelHeins#0000
This whale did. Not even let me win 1.  And I had a feeling if I bid 300 or 400 ERG they would outbid so i gave up

> *(re @SamuelHeins)*: No plots, the whale person won all the land.  ...

Ultimately, when the day arrives they will post links to auctions in the auction house. You place bids sending erg to the auctions address. If outbid the erg is sent back to you from the smart contract. Bids placed in the last half hour extend the auction to prevent sniping.


[04/05/2022 12:35 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Just be sure to follow official links or confirm the mint address. The auction house is loaded with fake plot scams.

Is the project planning on adding a logo to ErgoDex gitHub?  I guess that's the way to  make the logo show up.  Second question does the project plan on adding liquidity soon?

1. Yes. We still don‚Äôt have a logo for ValleyDAO, but we will have it one day.
2. We are not planning to add liquidity, currently there is only ~6% of the supply distributed to people. We will distribute more during next sale. Community members will add liquidity to the Dex if they want  and we are, as a  project, will focus on utility at the moment


[04/05/2022 10:17 AM] SamuelHeins#0000
I'm am new to liquidity and I added some to the dex.  I just thought more community would want to join me in adding liquidity if the logo was there.  Plus more confidence in buying.


[04/05/2022 10:18 AM] SamuelHeins#0000
I personally like the one you have here In telegram


[04/05/2022 10:20 AM] nirvanush#0000
I see agree with your point. We will have a logo suitable for a coin. For now there are so many micro tasks to do before the sale, so it‚Äôs hard to find time


[04/05/2022 10:20 AM] SamuelHeins#0000

Anyway, so i guess the erg billboard is hired by @HazeyOneKenobi for a month, but you still have an option to advertise on the main SigmaValley billboard. For 0.1 ValleyDAO a day.
ValleyDAO can be bought on ErgoDex


[04/05/2022 6:47 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Hazey hasn‚Äôt given me a timetable yet so the billboard is available by the day right now.


[04/05/2022 7:45 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
@Cryptoknightada if you want to rent the billboard details are at http://fornoreason.net/sigmavalley


[04/05/2022 7:46 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
It‚Äôs free for daily rental right now up until the whole plot gets rented out to Hazey at some undefined time in the future.


[04/05/2022 7:46 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
There‚Äôs a refund address field for any overage if it goes down.

1) Having a mansion with a swimming pool and mountain views in SigmaValley is a privilege few will know in their life. 
At least, that‚Äôs what one of our landlords was thinking while building his dream mansion in the prime real estate area of Sigma Valley, eUtXO Plains.

I find it simpler to manually apply each modifier. Too easy to forget about them then find a bug in say a mirror modifier that got altered when you move the object.


[04/06/2022 9:44 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#0000
im not sure the difference but i am about to educate myself


[04/06/2022 9:44 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
On the modifier itself is a drop down arrow at the top. There should be an apply option

It‚Äôs probably your tower image on the board. Make sure it‚Äôs jpg and you can easily get away with 80% quality.

Cool.  We'll wait on site metrics for any investment most likely.  We built a few custom PCs for Real Estate agents who buy/sell IRL and on Decentraland.  It's been a fun ride.  The ETH merge will drive a lot of attention to Ergo as 1.7million miners look for new revenue streams.  Autolykos2 is more efficient than most other hashing algos.

Sort by profit on any of the mining calcs and Ergo is top 5 in almost all cases, people will start to notice.  Needs to be a little more decentralized in terms of hashrate, hoping we can pull a few miners away from nanopool to help with that goal.

Ergonaut_Alpha no any 3D asset (within size constraint) can be imported to sigmavalley once you have a plot.

So if you bid 50 times on the 18 or so different plots we'll have up you will be rewarded for all your bids.

[04/08/2022 11:35 PM] BridgeBot#9505
ilyalbn But you don‚Äôt sound like a creator, more like someone who‚Äôs going to buy and flip. SigmaValley is a place for people to express themselves, do cool stuff and ise their imagination. So for flippers it might be hard to get


[04/08/2022 11:36 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
And yet the floor of this project is already your of your price range apparently so, there‚Äôs that. I guess there is demand.

Ergnomes, the biggest NFT project that sells out instantly.  only has 900 in discord. This is Ergo.


[04/08/2022 11:48 PM] BridgeBot#9505
ilyalbn We allow custom models from the day one, there are people who learned 3d modeling from scratch to build their plots (which is super impressive for me) People update their plots regularly to create different interactions/situations between landlords, and make fun. We‚Äôve just started but it‚Äôs a breathing project already. Its truly shaped by the participants

Give us some reasoning as well


[04/10/2022 10:31 AM] Maarten_V#0000
3 days is long enough. The bidding war will last days after that anyway as it extends each 30 min each bid


[04/10/2022 10:32 AM] Maarten_V#0000
A longer timeframe is not nessesary at all as it will only make people wait


[04/10/2022 10:33 AM] CharKoh63#0000
Same thoughts as Mr Maarten


[04/10/2022 10:33 AM] Maarten_V#0000
You see it each bidding again. The bids come the moment ends not the timeframe on it's own.


[04/10/2022 10:33 AM] BridgeBot#9505
JŒµnniŒµ D True. On the other hand I think it wouldn't be fair for auctions to end on a workday. A lot of people can't bid from work. üòÇ


[04/10/2022 10:34 AM] Maarten_V#0000
3 days of bidding is a long time.  And you got no control over the timeframe after it is it's coded to expand each 30 min


[04/10/2022 10:35 AM] CharKoh63#0000
Taking into consideration the time difference maybe 2 day is sufficient


[04/10/2022 10:35 AM] BridgeBot#9505
nirvanush Also I always mess up with the timezones of AH, so it will not be 3 days exactly ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÄ


[04/10/2022 10:43 AM] Maarten_V#0000
For all the bidders:  Get a wallet that can chain transactions and does not start with Y and ends with oroi


[04/10/2022 10:44 AM] Maarten_V#0000
you will lose the bidding war with the wallet that starts with Y and ends with oroi

A solid advice from a First Budding War veteran right here ‚òùÔ∏è


[04/10/2022 12:04 PM] BridgeBot#9505
FidgetyRat Spreading them out like last time is a good idea. I‚Äôm the opposite of what you said, I have less time on weekends and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs people In other time zones that would want some to end in their zone


[04/10/2022 12:06 PM] BridgeBot#9505
JŒµnniŒµ D Yeah, spreading them out was a good idea wasn't it. Everyone gets their chance, no one is stuck at work/sleeping/hunting Easter eggs when the auctions end.


[04/10/2022 12:07 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Honestly I think I only won mine because they ended outside my time zone and demand was lower. I yolo‚Äôd a big bid before going to sleep lol


[04/10/2022 12:07 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
Both of them?


[04/10/2022 12:08 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Yup. Actually that‚Äôs why I have 2.  I thought I‚Äôd lose one or both for sure.


[04/10/2022 12:08 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Turns out i got the two lowest price ü§™


[04/10/2022 12:09 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
That‚Äôs my advice for bidders this time. Don‚Äôt ignore auctions outside your zone and put realistic bids in. Don‚Äôt just bid one higher and expect to win.


[04/10/2022 12:10 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Often people may just say ‚Äúeh, it‚Äôs just one more erg. Fine.‚Äù But 10 more might be too much to chew for a counter bid.


[04/10/2022 12:17 PM] koutelier#0000
so i had an idea. and it's pretty doable i thing.


[04/10/2022 12:18 PM] BridgeBot#9505

JŒµnniŒµ D You *are* getting rewarded, remember?


[04/10/2022 12:20 PM] koutelier#0000
sigma valley could incorporate 3d nfts directly to the plots. in a way that people won't be able to copy/mint the nft and use it so the creators will be secured.


[04/10/2022 12:20 PM] BridgeBot#9505
JŒµnniŒµ D I understand the first sentence. And nothing after that.


[04/10/2022 12:21 PM] koutelier#0000
yeah let me explain it more.


[04/10/2022 12:21 PM] koutelier#0000
the creator will list an nft in the auction house. the person that will buy it he will connect in the sigma valley and he will be able to see the 3d nft in his assets. choose the nft and deploy it in the plot


[04/10/2022 12:22 PM] koutelier#0000
this will take sigma valley to another level lol


[04/10/2022 12:23 PM] koutelier#0000
the creator will have to upload his 3d plans in the sigma valley site pair them with the nft id pay a small fee for the service , (people could vote for the fee)  and that is it


[04/10/2022 12:24 PM] BridgeBot#9505
FidgetyRat I lose track of my awards üòé


[04/10/2022 12:26 PM] BridgeBot#9505
nirvanush I prefer not to have any fee friction for uploading/updating the model. It‚Äôs agains our interest


[04/10/2022 12:26 PM] BridgeBot#9505
FidgetyRat The .glb models are cached and rendered client side so this doesn‚Äôt really protect the model.


[04/10/2022 12:28 PM] koutelier#0000
so everything that is deployed in sigma valley is downloadable ?


[04/10/2022 12:29 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Got a new batch of free technical books for work. Wonder how that one snuck in the order‚Ä¶

nirvanush Yes, and there is no way to prevent it. Also all NFTs that you put on auction house, nothing stops you from downloading the image of any nft


[04/10/2022 12:30 PM] BridgeBot#9505
koutelier yeah the image of the nft doesn't really matter . the 3d model does , and the id)


[04/10/2022 12:31 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
What could help is developing a custom encryption on the model files that the engine can decrypt during render. Sigma models could be encapsulated before sale. Lot of work though.


[04/10/2022 12:31 PM] nirvanush#0000
It‚Äôs nice that people still prefer blogposts and youtube videos in printed format üôÇ


[04/10/2022 12:32 PM] BridgeBot#9505
nirvanush Yeah, the same way we encrypt videos and it‚Äôs downloaded in chunks


[04/10/2022 12:32 PM] koutelier#0000
if you whitelist the artist address ? so if the nft it's not from this address they won't appear in the sigma valley?


[04/10/2022 12:32 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt have paid for it. YouTube is plenty. But free is free


[04/10/2022 12:34 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
It‚Äôs the down side of a decentralized internet. Sigma should really focus on safety for plots. Unfortunately protecting art and models is a huge issue and one even Auction houses can‚Äôt figure out yet.


[04/10/2022 12:34 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
There would need to be some NFT standard.


[04/10/2022 12:35 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
But the more secure you make them the harder they are to use. Anyone remember early DRM in 2004?


[04/10/2022 12:35 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Sony even required root kits to hack your pcs to allow music to be played.

The best they can do is flag legit NFTs with a special mark or section. I believe that‚Äôs coming in v3

FidgetyRat I think 250 erg is the current floor but I‚Äôd expect it to be slightly lower with a larger mint.

[04/10/2022 3:52 PM] BridgeBot#9505
JŒµnniŒµ D Hello George. The auctions will start on April 12th (Tuesday) at the Ergo Auction House.


[04/10/2022 3:53 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
In order to avoid bidding on fakes, we urge you to access the auction through our website on Tuesday.


[04/10/2022 3:54 PM] Maarten_V#0000
perhaps a instruction video


[04/10/2022 3:54 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
The way to do that is by going to our website www.sigmavalley.org and clicking on the "auctions" tab on the top left of the page, which will direct you to the legitimate auctions.

[04/10/2022 4:37 PM] amg4life#0000
Just finished watching the video.  Thanks. I just have one question.  When you buy the land, do you have to bid for it, or can you just buy it without bidding for it?


[04/10/2022 4:39 PM] BridgeBot#9505
JŒµnniŒµ D No, it's an auction. It lasts a few days.
For every bid you place, you get a drop of ValleyDAO, which is the Sigma Valley token.
But you won't know if you are the owner until the auction ends.


[04/10/2022 4:40 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
I‚Äôll probably add a warning to my billboard about the fakes and mint address during the auctions.


[04/10/2022 4:41 PM] BridgeBot#9505
JŒµnniŒµ D Oh wow, that would be so cool.
You really are the model plot-owner.


[04/10/2022 4:41 PM] BridgeBot#9505
amg4life This is goes the same way for this upcoming plot sale on April 12th? You have to bid for it?


[04/10/2022 4:41 PM] BridgeBot#9505
JŒµnniŒµ D This is the only way we have ever done it. There are no legitimate sales out there, other than the one starting on the 12th.


[04/10/2022 4:42 PM] BridgeBot#9505

amg4life Can you bid on multiple auction?


[04/10/2022 6:06 PM] BridgeBot#9505
Maarten_V Sure, but the chain transaction is handy if you want to bid on multiple the same minute


[04/10/2022 6:06 PM] Maarten_V#0000
otherwise the wallet can't process the transactions


[04/10/2022 6:07 PM] Maarten_V#0000
My issue i had is that i had to continuesly recover my yoroi wallet as it plain does not work or is extreme slow


[04/10/2022 6:07 PM] BridgeBot#9505
amg4life nice! how do you set it up?


[04/10/2022 6:07 PM] Maarten_V#0000

[04/10/2022 6:07 PM] Maarten_V#0000
Nautilus SafeW and more


[04/10/2022 6:08 PM] Maarten_V#0000
You need a wallet with a Dapp Connector and being able to process multiple transactions at the same time.


[04/10/2022 6:08 PM] Maarten_V#0000
or a full node


[04/10/2022 6:08 PM] amg4life#0000
Eternl wallet has dapp connector


[04/10/2022 6:08 PM] Maarten_V#0000
but thats ADA and not Ergo


[04/10/2022 6:09 PM] Maarten_V#0000
Ergo is it's own blockchain


[04/10/2022 6:10 PM] amg4life#0000
ah yes, you are absolutely correct


[04/10/2022 6:10 PM] arcadiancomp#0000
Ergo full nodes are super easy to run on Linux/Win10[or 11]/macOS, just one *.jar file and one config file, then a few commands in the panel/swagger on the localhost web interface


[04/10/2022 6:11 PM] BridgeBot#9505

[04/10/2022 6:47 PM] BridgeBot#9505
nirvanush As far as i know mobile wallet has chained transactions support, so you can build on multiple auctions at the same time. I‚Äôm pretty sure Nautilus have implemented it as well


[04/10/2022 6:49 PM] nirvanush#0000
Mobile wallet is great functionality. If you don‚Äôt want to run a full node I‚Äôd recommend it for bidding.
Nautilus, is great too of course, i just have to confirm the chained transactions


[04/10/2022 7:23 PM] BridgeBot#9505
FidgetyRat Easy to run. Pain to get set up. Mine crashed a good 50 times during initial sync and took a week to finish ü§î


[04/10/2022 7:24 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Also be advised that the full nodes wallet only supports a single address and it has no confirmation on send. If you type the wrong amount or address it‚Äôs DONE.


[04/10/2022 7:27 PM] arcadiancomp#0000
Both points are true, confirm all addresses on the Ergo explorer before you hit send and expect to restart your node a few times before it fully syncs.  Luckily it's less than 750k blocks here in 2022, and a day is usually enough.

[04/11/2022 9:01 AM] BridgeBot#9505
JŒµnniŒµ D I don't remember exactly but it's 3 plot sizes (s-m-l) and three prices. Starting prices are pretty affordable.


[04/11/2022 11:09 AM] BridgeBot#9505
FidgetyRat To be frank, starting price means nothing on an auction. Final price is what matters.


[04/11/2022 1:20 PM] Man#0000

[04/11/2022 1:21 PM] BridgeBot#9505

[04/11/2022 1:47 PM] BridgeBot#9505
JŒµnniŒµ D auction


[04/11/2022 1:48 PM] Man#0000
What's the starting price? How's is the final decided?


[04/11/2022 1:48 PM] Maarten_V#0000
like a auction but then in crypto it's decentralised and hard coded


[04/11/2022 1:48 PM] Maarten_V#0000
the code in the auction house however prevents sniping


[04/11/2022 1:49 PM] Maarten_V#0000
so if someone bids in the last 30 min or so it extends it's timer with 30 min


[04/11/2022 1:49 PM] Maarten_V#0000
noone has control over it as it's coded that way


[04/11/2022 1:51 PM] BridgeBot#9505
JŒµnniŒµ D The final is when the time runs out


[04/11/2022 1:52 PM] Maarten_V#0000
in my observation you sometimes see the timer running out for a minute or 2 and then reset to 30 minutes again as it just waited for the 'heartbeat' of the blockchain to give confirmation or not.


[04/11/2022 1:53 PM] BridgeBot#9505
JŒµnniŒµ D Yep


[04/11/2022 1:56 PM] Man#0000

would you advice making a lot of bids to get lots of SV tokens?


[04/11/2022 8:19 PM] JOFLITO#0000

[04/11/2022 8:22 PM] BridgeBot#9505
FidgetyRat No need to bid against yourself. The plots will get to a of bids either way.


[04/11/2022 8:22 PM] FidgetyRat#0000

I like the idea of holding dao to enable the animation layers.


[04/11/2022 10:06 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
I haven‚Äôt delved too much into that area, but I was afraid we had to pay dao for the feature each upload (which I do often). Holding a sum is a cool way to account for that and give some utility to hold.

[04/12/2022 3:35 AM] August#0000
Noob question‚Ä¶if the auction is open for 3-4 days, is the latest bid amount always shown, or is it a blind bid and highest bidder will know whenever the auction is complete? Sorry if this was already explained, just trying to understand completely before diving in tomorrow


[04/12/2022 6:17 AM] BridgeBot#9505
nirvanush Glad you like it! I don‚Äôt want the token to return to the ‚Äúbank‚Äù every time, because we want to distribute it and make worth holding. Real demand, real value


[04/12/2022 6:19 AM] BridgeBot#9505
nirvanush Hey! Latest bid is always shown. You place a bid and if someone outbid you you will get your erg back to the wallet straight away, so you can place another bid or give up.


[04/12/2022 10:07 AM] August#0000
> August  Thanks! Will definitely jump on and check it out today


[04/12/2022 11:09 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
I had one of those repetitive dreams last night where I was bidding on plots over and over. I think my brain is ready.


[04/12/2022 11:11 AM] nirvanush#0000
Did you wake up before you won or after?


[04/12/2022 11:20 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
It was one of MY dreams. So it was endless bidding and technical issues, checking addresses I‚Äôve r and over till outbid, etc.


[04/12/2022 11:20 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
I checked my temperature because it was so similar to my fever dream patterns.

2 things can happen for lost bids. The first try refunding it. You need the proxy address. I had this happen one time in hundreds of bids


[04/12/2022 5:56 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
The second is you sent the wrong amount for a bid. The overage is lost forever.

Ot proportional to a plot size. It equal amount for every bid regardless the plot. We are going to distribute about 6-7% of the total supply of ValleyDAO to auction participants. Of course winners get extra

ok i just read about valley DAO . i didnt know they were doing a DOA . Wouldn't a whale have more  votes in a DAO. That is usually the case because of voting power

Whales tend to place fewer high bids


[04/12/2022 8:16 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
So they end up with less DAO than everyone else who bids by small increments


[04/12/2022 8:16 PM] ilyalbn#0000
> ilyalbn You are getting ValleyDAO token for every bid, even if you didn't win. This token is used to advertize in the Valley and also in the near future will be used for voting on decision making + add animation to your model. Or you can just sell it someone who need it for one of those


[04/12/2022 8:18 PM] ihunt86#0000
This same whale owns 7 plots from the last auction ..... Anyways ill keep bidding and be happy for the rich.  Just hard to watch one person sweep the minting process

I think the whale has a budget to buy X plots. He put the full amount on it. once he is outbid he has his ergo released to put on another cheper plot. but there is a limit


[04/12/2022 9:01 PM] JOFLITO#0000
if anything, a whale being so eager is a bullish sign

You would like it to be cheaper so you could get a plot. It isn't.


[04/13/2022 5:20 AM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
Your objections are really neither here nor there.


[04/13/2022 5:21 AM] T#0000
Your community will always be limited by the small mint size and high price.  A community of like 200 ppl isn‚Äôt going to thrive like other metaverses

In total around 250


[04/13/2022 5:27 AM] CryptoCaliburn#0000

Have a set mint price that is reasonable.  One whale can completely decide the whole fate of the project but just deciding to bid everything yo


[04/13/2022 5:29 AM] T#0000

Someone is bidding up the mint price.  The same mint price for all plots

The royalty we've set on secondary sales of the plots. Discourages flipping.


[04/13/2022 5:37 AM] T#0000
No this is all about making as much money at the expense of the community


[04/13/2022 5:37 AM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
In fact, despite the (very) high demand of plots in these past three months only one got resold in the secondary.


[04/13/2022 5:38 AM] T#0000
Because there‚Äôs no demand


[04/13/2022 5:38 AM] T#0000
And the mint was too high

This is a developing project. So the potential is significant. We are working towards making it more interactive. ...
As things are now, owning a plot would allow you to advertise your projects (Idk if you see the Nautilus helmet, the ErgoPad rocket, COMET's immense and garish statue) but also lease it out


[04/13/2022 5:45 AM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
One of our plot owners for example has put up a billboard on his plot which he is renting to all interested for a fee


[04/13/2022 5:45 AM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
I should note that whatever you get from the commercial ideas on your plots is and stays yours


[04/13/2022 5:45 AM] nirvanush#0000
I want to say that all your thought are legit and you can say whatever you want, but if you want to blame us in something like that you have to bring an evidence. 
I do believe that it hurt the community and personally would love to see more diversification and more people owning a plot for a smaller price instead of one whale, but nothing I can do about it, it‚Äôs an auction because of the limited supply. And the price will adjust itself next auction if the community get stuck in development because of it.


[04/13/2022 5:45 AM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
Nothing comes back to us

[04/13/2022 6:05 AM] T#0000
You didn‚Äôt block me lol.  But it‚Äôs very clear.  Someone is bidding up the price. I would recommend anyone here to realize these are inflated prices.  Literally no secondary market because there is no demand for them at these prices.

[04/13/2022 12:57 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Buy now pricing wouldn‚Äôt make sense. It‚Äôs usually 3-4x the start bid and with the floor at 250‚Ä¶


[04/13/2022 12:59 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Plus. For normal NFTs there are thousands of them. It‚Äôs easy to see a floor form based on secondary sales.  Something as rare and sought after as a plot is much harder and needs the market to determine organically.


[04/13/2022 1:01 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
I also think the higher price also has the added benefit of protecting the project from bad actors.


[04/13/2022 1:01 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Less likely to have hostile trolls or people hurting the project when 250 erg is on the line.

The cetaceans are asleep, the AH is expanding and contracting time, the landlords are tweaking their creations in Sigma Valley- is this the quiet before the storm?
Stay tuned to find out..

 Good deal. Also, when you place a bid you get a QR code, and you send your bid amount to that address. I assume it‚Äôs then taken out of your wallet and held pending bid outcome. If I lose the bid (or lose the highest bid), my original bid is then sent to my wallet. Is this correct?

 You don‚Äôt tell them anything. You make seperate bank accounts and share it over multiple accounts. Each account is ‚Äòsecured‚Äô to a certain amount by the government

Soooo, does this auction expire literally when the timer runs out, or will it extend a little if someone makes a fresh bid? 

I guess I‚Äôm asking if In the end the most important thing is to get bud moments before auction ends.

 No, there's a measure against last minute sniping


[04/15/2022 4:00 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
It resets the clock by half an hour or so if someone bids at tge last minute


[04/15/2022 4:22 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
You may see the clock hit 0 for a few minutes. It waits for the next block to see if there‚Äôs any last minute bids before closing.

Wilde and Joyce too. Basically the whole list of Irish. You‚Äôd be surprised by how good some of the Russian poetry has been. Or maybe you wouldn‚Äôt be lol.

 Oh no, I don't mind that. With Yeats it's usually a verse or another from The Second Coming these past 5 years or so. They don't know it's his at all. And tragically (lol, for people who love the written word anyway) they will often misattribute it too. 
Someone once told me "It's like Bukowski said "The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity".
Could have punched them in the throat.

[04/15/2022 10:38 PM] JOFLITO#0000

[04/15/2022 10:38 PM] Mochino1980#0000

[04/15/2022 10:41 PM] JOFLITO#0000

[04/15/2022 10:41 PM] JOFLITO#0000
are you using Nautilus or the app?


[04/15/2022 10:41 PM] Mochino1980#0000
i used yorio


[04/15/2022 10:41 PM] JOFLITO#0000
check your address on ergoExplorer


[04/15/2022 10:42 PM] JOFLITO#0000

[04/15/2022 10:42 PM] Mochino1980#0000

[04/15/2022 10:50 PM] Maarten_V#0000

 it happened with ergoDex for a time


[04/15/2022 10:54 PM] JOFLITO#0000
it had to do with the way the change is handled


[04/15/2022 10:54 PM] JOFLITO#0000
something among the lines of "getChangeAddress()" function


[04/15/2022 10:55 PM] JOFLITO#0000
instead of "mainAdress()"


[04/15/2022 10:55 PM] Mochino1980#0000
but now nautilus wallet shows zero , dont know how to change this i see 3 addresses on the wallet but not the one where i have the assets


[04/15/2022 10:56 PM] JOFLITO#0000
lol


[04/15/2022 10:56 PM] JOFLITO#0000
add some addresses on Nautilus sir, you will get there eventually


[04/15/2022 10:56 PM] weissmonster81#0000
Or mobile wallet too


[04/15/2022 10:56 PM] weissmonster81#0000
Adding 11 will let you find it rather quickly

[04/15/2022 11:12 PM] Mochino1980#0000
Is it possible that all my amount has been send to another address that is not mine?


[04/15/2022 11:12 PM] SamuelHeins#0000
Yes


[04/15/2022 11:13 PM] SamuelHeins#0000
At the top of auction house website there is a wallet area and you could have one assigned.   So if you bit with another wallet and do not win the refund will go to the wallet assigned at top of auction h

> Mochino1980 re @SamuelHeins: Yes 
 
 wtf


[04/15/2022 11:21 PM] Mochino1980#0000
what happen if somebody else outbided me, does the bid amount etc will send back or after the auction finisched


[04/15/2022 11:22 PM] JOFLITO#0000
sent back as soon as someone outbids you


[04/15/2022 11:23 PM] Mochino1980#0000
ok so i need to wait before all amounts come back right..


[04/15/2022 11:23 PM] Mochino1980#0000
i see somebody outbided me


[04/15/2022 11:35 PM] SamuelHeins#0000
Yes outbid and look at what wallet is listed at the top wallet logo at the top of the auction page

[04/16/2022 12:26 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
The auction sends back to whatever address was registered to the auction house at the time of the bid. Not the alley the funds were sent from.


[04/16/2022 12:27 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
When you click bid it creates a temporary proxy address for that auction.  As long as the funds arriving at that address equal the requested it considers you bidding. It doesn‚Äôt care where those funds come from

The royalties‚Äîis someone able to expand upon that? Is it 10% royalties on just initial purchase, or will 10% royalties be paid in every sale pertaining to said plot.


[04/16/2022 12:38 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
All sales. It‚Äôs baked into the protocol.


[04/16/2022 12:38 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
The first sale is technically excluded because the royalty is paid the minter as he is the seller.

[04/16/2022 1:54 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
It‚Äôs not like eBay where everyone waits till the last minute. Each bid in the last 30 mins extends the auction

 It doesn‚Äôt really matter which wallet you have. You can have yoroi and still connect via ‚Äúany wallet‚Äù. Wallets are just a ui.

Hello, i have a question. I wanted to buy a small and cosy place in Sigmavalley where i can make a little pub for the Ergonauts and friends, i just dont know much about coding. Is anyone here able to help with this problem if i pay some Ergo coins? :) Thank you.

 Thank you. I would need help to make the pub from drawing scetches in virtual object first of all, and then i would like to make some music playlist that plays when you click on it. Maybe later a chatbox or chatroom that opens.


[04/16/2022 5:04 PM] Senna#0000
I dont know how complex this is, but i imagine people coming to Sigmavalley and click on the pub to have some nice background atmosphere for their homeplace when they are at the computer or smartphone. And then they can talk to each other like in a telegram group, just with Sigmavalley theme appearance. It must not be super extravagante.

 Ok, building a model and having a page with a music playlist is easy part. A chat is a bit harder because it  requires some server side development, but totally possible. 
I can guide you through the process, and advice some freelance developers to work on this (from fiverr).

Wow that would be amazing thank you! I try to get some spot today and hopefully we can move on with this discussion later!


[04/16/2022 5:17 PM] nirvanush#0000
Basically the way it works: you have a plot with a model, when user clicks it shows him the description of that plot (what you decide to write there) and a link. User clicks on the link it takes him to your webpage with any custom interaction that you want, can be even another 3d world


[04/16/2022 5:20 PM] Senna#0000
I understand, i also thought it would be great to get connected to the "pub-homepage" when you click on the pub, because there you could do cool stuff like a bar, a jukebox (where people can interact with playlist for a very very small donation of tokens or sth), a donation box, a menucard (where people can share recipes of food, cocktails, any stuff).

Sleep is an essential function1 that allows your body and mind to recharge, leaving you refreshed and alert when you wake up. Healthy sleep also helps the body remain healthy and stave off diseases. Without enough sleep, the brain cannot function properly. This can impair your abilities2 to concentrate, think clearly, and process memories.

Most adults require between seven and nine hours3 of nightly sleep. Children and teenagers need substantially more sleep, particularly if they are younger than five years of age. Work schedules, day-to-day stressors, a disruptive bedroom environment, and medical conditions can all prevent us from receiving enough sleep. A healthy diet and positive lifestyle habits can help ensure an adequate amount of sleep each night ‚Äì but for some, chronic lack of sleep may be the first sign of a sleep disorder.

Meanwhile, there's the mystery of @DcoinsErg3, busy hiding Easter eggs all around the Valley.

 This time we‚Äôve distributed the same amount of token to a smaller audience, so this time bidders and winners got bigger amount for their participation. 
But animated models are going to be expensive, because we can‚Äôt have many animated animation on the page (due to web performance limitations). So in most cases the one who want to animate his model will need to get somehow the token from other people

 Are you referring to Large #8 Wen Moon on Erg Auctions? I actually won that one and just saw it up for auction, so scam maybe? How do you see the original sellers address on the auctions?

Artist ID is what matters on auction house.

 Stick tiny objects at the plot corners or underground. Scale accordingly. When I work I have fake grass exactly scaled to the plot that doesn‚Äôt export.

 I think I understand what you are trying to ask. The mint address is preserved in nft data (somehow) even if it‚Äôs being sold from a different holder

 You get more trust that it's a "verified" token and more people trade ( logo helps too) then you get more liquidity trading fees


[04/23/2022 5:49 PM] SamuelHeins#0000
But yes you are right the project should lock some liquidity too.  The best projects focus on utility and Sigma Vally is good at that too

[05/03/2022 12:39 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
I think I understand your kind of sale. It's high enough that if it sells you *almost* don't regret it, but it is high enough that whoever gets it must really really be into it (and have the funds)

 I fell in love with it the moment I saw it. This project was actually my first introduction into ergo at all. I came across SV before I ever knew of Ergo. Was absolutely excited to see more plots get auctions. Buidl is (de)central to everything.

It‚Äôs like the first load is glitchy and refreshes itself a ton of time until it‚Äôs satisfied.

The valley usually doesn‚Äôt like my iPhone though. I get this if you move the camera over the center of the map.

 Not directly. I am definitely a big fan of the Aneta team & I liked their approach of bringing interoperability between chains. My experience of interacting with the community inspired the song title and release method

It's not some shitty hello world contract. Once integrated it will allow our landlord to rent their plots for erg. But in a mean, you can rent from me 1 @CometMooning for 8 minutes period for 0.003Erg. This offer will never come back...

[05/26/2022 7:27 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
(re  : *<Ergonaut_Alpha> @FidgetyRat any tips on creating a brick texture?*) 
 
 Detailed textures will be rough since they repeat and need to not look totally repetitive. I ended up using a low res normal map to create a rough effect and shaped my own bricks from poly.


[05/26/2022 7:28 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
You could probably get away with going 2 dimensional on the texture for detail and ignore things like bump and normal. If you reuse the texture a lot the file size pays for itself. For example I use my normal map texture for a lot of pieces since it‚Äôs generic

 Hello Nir! There isn't a plot sale at the moment, and there is a token, yes


[06/08/2022 5:23 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000

How does one become eligible for the plot sale?
How/where can one buy ValleyDAO token?

Oh you don't have to do anything but be willing to bid at the auctions!

 But pleas be careful on the auction house. Unless announced by the team listings are always fake


[06/08/2022 5:33 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
And as for ValleyDAO you can get it on ErgoDex, though we do give ValleyDAO to everyone who bids in the auctions too!

[06/08/2022 5:44 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
There were 2 sales. I think @nirvanush had links to the auctions that completed but I‚Äôm not confident  the auction site retains them that long.


[06/08/2022 5:44 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Maybe we can answer questions about them.

If the average plot sold for 2K.  Is that about right with what ERG was priced at the time?  That means the next auction if it was to happen today would go for 1,000 ERG

 What‚Äôs the process in that? Do I have to be logged in and select an option, then share that with the individual interested?

[06/19/2022 1:31 PM] nirvanush#0000
Ok an important question.
The rent will be in Ergo but I want to force attaching some ValleyDAO token to the rent transaction (gas fee :D) to generate demand for ValleyDAO. 
Who should be the recipent of that token? 
1. SigmaValley - I don‚Äôt like this option because I want to distribute the token instead of collecting it.
2. landlord - I don‚Äôt like this option because, landlord usually have a ton of token already and it will add even more power to landlords. bad distirbution. 
3. To himself - dubm, but that way at least it will encourage renter find and hold some token (ergoDEX, auctions)
4. Burn üî•
5. Another option? ‚ùî


[06/19/2022 1:36 PM] JOFLITO#0000
liquidity pool?


[06/19/2022 1:36 PM] JOFLITO#0000
miners from 4 years


[06/19/2022 1:37 PM] nirvanush#0000
Can you explain?


[06/19/2022 1:37 PM] JOFLITO#0000
idk how sir


[06/19/2022 1:37 PM] JOFLITO#0000
but 1st option is sending the valleyDao token to the ergoDex liquidity pool


[06/19/2022 1:38 PM] JOFLITO#0000
locked during the rent period


[06/19/2022 1:39 PM] JOFLITO#0000
second option is putting sigamValley token in a box without erg


[06/19/2022 1:39 PM] JOFLITO#0000
so a it will be charged as storage rent in 4 years


[06/19/2022 1:42 PM] nirvanush#0000
With first option you dilute the ergo/valleyDAO pair and drive the price down, no?


[06/19/2022 1:43 PM] JOFLITO#0000
(re @nirvanush : *With first option you dilute the ergo/valleyDAO pair and drive the price down, no?*) 
 
 no, price stays the same


[06/19/2022 1:43 PM] JOFLITO#0000
unless they sell their valleydao to get erg ü§£


[06/19/2022 1:43 PM] JOFLITO#0000
adding liquidity keeps the price the same and decreases slippage


[06/19/2022 1:44 PM] JOFLITO#0000
lets say you ask for 0.1erg and the equivalent in valleyDao


[06/19/2022 1:44 PM] JOFLITO#0000
if they add directly from their wallet, price stays the same


[06/19/2022 1:45 PM] JOFLITO#0000
(re @C4lculista : *if they add directly from their wallet, price stays the same*) 
 
 if they sell valleyDao to get the 0.1 erg, priceDumps


[06/19/2022 1:47 PM] nirvanush#0000
I don‚Äôt understand. landlord ask 10 erg per month for rent. Renter send it directly to landlord and not the token rented for month, Erg goes directly to landlord. ValleyDAO goes to liquidity pool


[06/19/2022 1:48 PM] JOFLITO#0000
(re @nirvanush : *I don‚Äôt understand. landlord ask 10 erg per month for rent. Renter send it directly to landlord and not the token rented for month, Erg goes directly to landlord. ValleyDAO goes to liquidity pool*)

For marketing purposes


[06/19/2022 2:14 PM] koutelier#0000
Without the fear of rugpull . Because those tokens will be from the pool


[06/19/2022 2:15 PM] koutelier#0000
For example top 3 models will earn some tokens


[06/19/2022 2:15 PM] koutelier#0000

but we can rent it for 1 erg per week and send me 100k ergs in my address


[06/21/2022 6:52 PM] nirvanush#0000
What ever price you define. Here is how it will work:
1. LL defines the price and period
2. While plot is locked in a contract it‚Äôs still available to LL to change his models and stuff,
3. Renter send money for the whole period to LL + 5ValleyDAO gas fee that goes to a rewards bank.
4. From that point LL can‚Äôt use his plot untill the renting period is ower, but Renter can use the plot like his own (except selling it lol)


[06/21/2022 6:52 PM] Darkkknight111#0000

also it would be cool if you add a bot that will announce when a plot is listed for renting and when a plot is rented


[06/24/2022 8:54 PM] nirvanush#0000
Plot insurance contract should be a bureaucratic mess‚Ä¶ You sign a transaction it returns you because signatures are missing in some places

(re @nirvanush : *Man, I‚Äôm so excited it‚Äôs like the totally new thing, plot renting*) 
 
 the fun thing is now owners that don't have the knowledge or the time to build something they can earn passive income by renting their plots


[06/24/2022 10:32 PM] koutelier#0000
to people that want to build for their projects or for fun . i will try to grab couple of more plots if they list it for reasonable prices

 What happens when the lease is over? Does the renter need to remove what she has built? Is that part of the contract?

Thank you for your welcome

(re @odiseus_me : *What happens when the lease is over? Does the renter need to remove what she has built? Is that part of the contract?*) 
 
 Yeah the owner must remove the plot after or before listing


[06/26/2022 12:33 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *What happens when the lease is over? Does the renter need to remove what she has built? Is that part of the contract?*) 
 
 The owner can remove the model after the lease is up. It‚Äôs not automatic.

It‚Äôs better that way. In case the renter wants to renew but the LL hasn‚Äôt had the time to re-list. There‚Äôs no disruption.


[06/26/2022 12:35 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
I really expected some of those unused plots to show up for rent. People losing out on some erg there.

 You‚Äôll still need, but it will be just a few lines of code and you‚Äôll not need sign a tx, just data, so it more trustless

Omicron v4 and v5


[07/05/2022 9:49 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
5 is the most common right now and ignores immunity to previous omicron infection and the vaccines

but it's not that danger like other versions ?


[07/05/2022 9:49 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
More dangerous than omicron 1-3 but not as bad as the OG


[07/05/2022 9:50 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Omicron 1-3 didn‚Äôt enter lungs much but 4-5 do


[07/05/2022 9:50 PM] JOFLITO#0000

If don‚Äôt have you own ideas, you can always reach out to people on Twitter, Discord, Reddit and offer your plot as a platform for their projects. For a rent fee, for free or just for a cost of a model. Don‚Äôt be shy ‚ò∫Ô∏è you have an asset, use it for good

CALLING ALL LANDLORDS

I want to make another funny treasury hunt(like the easter egg hunt i made few months ago) 
I would be glad if you deploy a 3d model to your plot with some hidden stuff ;) 
I will personally design and hide the stuff i want so you will only have to deploy the 3d model.

Please DM me if you are interested

I'm not aware of the possibilities here, but it would be nice if we can showcase the raffles, their feedbacks, and the result of spending funds. Like a photo gallery that presents the results of aids and donations.

There are a few rooms in this design, so maybe one for that and one for current raffles.

No, but I suppose the fundraiser would be happy to provide it, at least for some of them. The "Success Stories" section in the main page was intended to be used for the same reason and testimonials. I remember, CriptogirlB reported the spending and the happiness around it in twitter (Help the Wich√¨ families of Chaco, Argentina).

how do we know what words are the secret words for the seed phrase?


[07/27/2022 12:42 AM] koutelier#0000
The hint or word usually has the number of the word somewhere near the word or the hint.


[07/27/2022 12:42 AM] koutelier#0000
For example if ‚Äúgood‚Äù is a seed phrase work . It will look like ‚Äúgood 5‚Äù or ‚Äú5 good‚Äù or even ‚Äúfive good‚Äù

 Hey, no you are sending this box to yourself if you look closely on the tx


[07/27/2022 5:16 AM] nirvanush#0000

 Not even this, the tx is not submitted to blockchain. It‚Äôs used on be to verify that you are the owner of the address

what do the descriptions mean in sigma valley when you click on a structure? like Small #11, Pineapple Pizza Paradise for example....are these clues?


[07/27/2022 5:51 AM] ctrl_eng#0000
because some numbers are used twice so it can't be, right?

Is it possible to buy a plot in partnership? A DAO? I mean - is there a system/smart contracts in place to allow that? I would happily share such a purchase with a couple others here‚Ä¶


[07/27/2022 10:17 AM] notmork#0000
Maybe with a multisig wallet?

 Not yet, but it‚Äôs a cool case üôÇ


[07/27/2022 10:18 AM] nirvanush#0000
Can be done with smart contract I think and muti sig yes


[07/27/2022 10:19 AM] nirvanush#0000
But wow, it‚Äôs a lot of development I think. Let‚Äôs say you buy it together, next what you do if you want to sell it?

(re @nirvanush : *But wow, it‚Äôs a lot of development I think. Let‚Äôs say you buy it together, next what you do if you want to sell it?*) 
 
 Well, that depends on how flexible the smart-contracts are. I can think of two or three  ways this could be done (from the commercial point of view);

(re @odiseus_me : *Well, that depends on how flexible the smart-contracts are. I can think of two or three  ways this could be done (from the commercial point of view);*) 
 
 It can be done, I also know a few startups who do fractionalization of NFT and buy-together experience


[07/27/2022 12:53 PM] nirvanush#0000
Imo it should be a marketplace feature or some external dapps i guess


[07/27/2022 12:54 PM] nirvanush#0000

(re @odiseus_me : *So more relevant for SkyHarbor?*) 
 
 Yeah, SkyHarbor may like it!


[07/27/2022 12:56 PM] nirvanush#0000
Some smart contract that lock nft and sends fraction NFT to every participant.

 You can have a smart contract that holds an NFT and requires each party to use a fractional share of the NFT to spend it. Split sale could definitely be integrated on Sky Harbor for this


[07/27/2022 1:11 PM] nirvanush#0000
Yeah seems like a great feature for you guys for the next bull run :)


[07/27/2022 1:11 PM] KrasaviceBlasen#0000

 If you agree to implement it - I will buy the next available plot, and place it for a fractional sale when you make the feature available !

 If it will be available on SkyHarbor, i can implement that every fraction holder will have an access to the plot

 That would be epic . Me and @C4lculista owns the plot . We trust each other but would be nice to be smart contract for that . @nirvanush could be possible to divide a plot if they owners are  more than one? Deploy two different models

 I would have bought your plot - if it was still 900... but now that you have updated the price I guess you'll have another buyer.

(re @odiseus_me : *So - it's you who are selling (mixed you up with @koutelier and @C4lculista - sorry)... 900 erg would have worked. Next...*) 
 
 The problem with 900 erg is its $600 less that what I paid for the plot at today's prices.   Part of me doesn't want to sell but if I do it will be for a profit and not a loss

[07/28/2022 1:47 AM] SwampAudio#0000
(re @ctrl_eng : *there is one in swamps website? i didn't see anything there*) 
 
 Hiding amongst the swamp reeds is a word, a hidden word which is spoken every so often to awaken the swamp gods ‚Ä¶.

Where it hides is in plain sight,
Its not something which is heard
But speak the word repeatedly and you have your answer.

And remember, every album, song, and artist is a clickable link on the site ;)

 They are on ErgoDex. They were distributed during the two main auction times for anyone bidding or winning plots.


[07/28/2022 11:17 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Eventually will be used for voting and decisions in the valley and are also used to add text to the airplane or main billlboard on the mountain and are needed to rent plots.


[07/28/2022 11:18 AM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @FidgetyRat : *They are on ErgoDex. They were distributed during the two main auction times for anyone bidding or winning plots.*) 
 
 Will there be further distributions? If one buys a plot - does she get the tokens that were issued to the original buyer?


[07/28/2022 11:19 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Yes there will be more plots sold over time, usually 16 plots at a time are auctioned. It‚Äôs happened twice so far. Next wasn‚Äôt announced yet.


[07/28/2022 11:20 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
The dao is not transferred. It‚Äôs only a little bit for winning. Most comes from each bid placed whether won or lost


[07/28/2022 11:21 AM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @FidgetyRat : *Yes there will be more plots sold over time, usually 16 plots at a time are auctioned. It‚Äôs happened twice so far. Next wasn‚Äôt announced yet.*) 
 
 I see, but for someone who buys a plot from an existing owner - doesn‚Äôt that make the new buyer eligible for the DAO token?


[07/28/2022 11:22 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
No.


[07/28/2022 11:22 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
The dao token was a reward for bidding in the auctions. It‚Äôs not tied to a plot


[07/28/2022 11:24 AM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @FidgetyRat : *The dao token was a reward for bidding in the auctions. It‚Äôs not tied to a plot*) 
 
 OK. So the only way to get it now is from ErgoDex, right?


[07/28/2022 11:25 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Yes.


[07/28/2022 11:25 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
I doubt it‚Äôs worth a lot üòÇ


[07/28/2022 11:26 AM] odiseus_me#0000
And how many tokens were typically distributed per plot won?


[07/28/2022 11:27 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
100 or so. It depended on how much activity during the auction. It was maybe 50 for each bid accepted by the auction house


[07/28/2022 11:27 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
So winning a plot was the same as maybe 2 lost bids.


[07/28/2022 11:27 AM] odiseus_me#0000
I see


[07/28/2022 11:31 AM] odiseus_me#0000

 I dont thnk so, as long as someone uses a script you will never win, once they reach down to two words they can crack the wallet in hours, and minutes using cloud computer (which costs a $1 or less to use per hour), and with one word left it takes less than 10 seconds using a normal computer

i got an idea. you hide parts of a url in 15 places, and then u cant guess since you dont know how long is the url.

and in the url is the wallet seed phrase?


[07/28/2022 12:49 PM] Gvuldis#0000
like a reaaaaalllyyy long url, which you cant possibly get with a script

[07/28/2022 12:51 PM] Gvuldis#0000
or instead of a url, a reallly long sequence of words/symbols, which you need to send to a telegram/discord bot, which has a cooldown of 10seconds for example, even less scriptable


[07/28/2022 12:53 PM] nirvanush#0000
How about this:

You have a qr code but some of the squares are wrong
Then you are looking for the coordinates of it in hunt and flip the squares, once you flipped all the wrong ones you can scan the correct code


[07/28/2022 12:54 PM] Gvuldis#0000
still, you wouldn't need to get every clue, because with most of the qr code done, the rest could be scripted, no?

You can release 18 words (3 of them additional/random) and the last clue says which ones you should ignore.

 No. I just woke up. Was it released recently or been there all along?


[07/28/2022 3:08 PM] stillDreamy#0000
Our hypothesis was that 1-9 were in the valley and 10-15 were on socials and websites. Is that right?


[07/28/2022 3:08 PM] Gvuldis#0000
every one except 7 was there


[07/28/2022 3:08 PM] Gvuldis#0000
7 was going to be video from CW on sunday, but someone just scripted and got the wallet without the last word


[07/28/2022 3:09 PM] Gvuldis#0000
12 was in the valley too


[07/28/2022 3:09 PM] stillDreamy#0000

Congratulations to the PIRATE who HACKED their way to the SigmaValley Treasure!

This tricky person got all but one word, and used a script to bruteforce the remaining combinations

Our word was hidden inside a single-song page which shared the same name!

In this video, we will look at Web Automation using Python in detail. We will be using the Webdriver and Selenium Libraries to do our coding, and we will be filling out an attendance form, automating that, and validating if it did. Hope You learn something new!

 I mean, I have a TG bot that sends a message every hour to a TG group, but to have this message displayed on a billboard for example on my plot - this is where I don‚Äôt have a clue

Ilya knows lol


[07/29/2022 1:31 PM] JOFLITO#0000
if you are using blender you can use python there


[07/29/2022 1:31 PM] JOFLITO#0000
look up "blender python api"


[07/29/2022 1:35 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @C4lculista : *probably max once every blockc tho*) 
 
 Irrelevant .

(re @odiseus_me : *I mean, I have a TG bot that sends a message every hour to a TG group, but to have this message displayed on a billboard for example on my plot - this is where I don‚Äôt have a clue*) 
 
 First of all the models should be less that 2mb in size and in glb format


[07/29/2022 1:36 PM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @koutelier : *First of all the models should be less that 2mb in size and in glb format*) 
 
 So that means I can‚Äôt display changing text messages on a model?


[07/29/2022 1:37 PM] koutelier#0000
For the valley I don‚Äôt believe there is an api but you can make a bot that will do the deploy actions automatically. And make another bot to update the model in blender


[07/29/2022 1:37 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *So that means I can‚Äôt display changing text messages on a model?*) 
 
 You can


[07/29/2022 1:37 PM] koutelier#0000
But you need to build a bot for that


[07/29/2022 1:42 PM] odiseus_me#0000
OK then. I‚Äôll learn a little more about bots and see what I can do. Thanks!


[07/29/2022 1:47 PM] koutelier#0000
Basically you need to learn how to make a bot that works with blender


[07/29/2022 1:47 PM] koutelier#0000
Maybe there is an open source bot for that


[07/29/2022 1:47 PM] koutelier#0000
Look at GitHub

Anyone here using rhino to build in 3d? How. Do you export your builds in .glb format (as required for upload here.


[07/30/2022 1:45 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
All blender for me.


[07/30/2022 2:11 PM] SwampAudio#0000
In cinema4d you need to export as FBX and then use a converter to convert FBX to GLB


[07/30/2022 2:11 PM] SwampAudio#0000
might be similar in other programs

[07/30/2022 3:54 PM] koutelier#0000
then remove mine and put your plot in the center


[07/30/2022 3:54 PM] koutelier#0000
dm me


[07/30/2022 3:59 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
(re @C4lculista : *I think that info is in the NFT*) 
 
 Correct the size In the metadata. That can be used to at least get the ratio but sigma auto sized anything to fit so units aren‚Äôt accurate.


[07/30/2022 3:59 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
What I do is create a flat plane the size of the plot in metadata units as 1 meter then use that as the ‚Äúfloor‚Äù that is hidden on export.


[07/30/2022 4:00 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
I also create a small block on that plane representing an object to determine scale.


[07/30/2022 4:00 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
You can also bury small corner markers underground to retain the scale during auto size


[07/30/2022 4:11 PM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @FidgetyRat : *You can also bury small corner markers underground to retain the scale during auto size*) 
 
 Thanks much. I see I have a problem - the previous building was on a rectangular shape that is smaller than the plot so when I come with a new model it snaps to it. How do i delete everything from plot?


[07/30/2022 4:29 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
You can‚Äôt. Just upload a blank model


[07/30/2022 4:32 PM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @FidgetyRat : *You can‚Äôt. Just upload a blank model*) 
 
 wouldnt it still snap to the current model that is on the plot?


[07/30/2022 4:33 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
It will overwrite an existing model.


[07/30/2022 5:06 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *wouldnt it still snap to the current model that is on the plot?*)

@odiseus_me you don't need to upload each time . you can check the model before uploading


[07/30/2022 5:43 PM] odiseus_me#0000
So, whichever model I upload - this light brown square remains and any model I upload just snaps to it. Any clue what it is and how to get rid of it?

 the square disappears - but whatever I build and upload - still snaps to it - so something is on the plot which prevents me from putting there structures that are bigger than that (now un-seen) square.

 well you are both right and wrong plots in real life doesn't have a clear mark unless the owner put a fence or something. since these was not owned by someone the mark is not there . i though you knew because it was a nut house there. but maybe llya could put something there . usually before every sale he puts those under constructions models so people know what the model is .

 When you come to buy a plot - someone shows you the boundaries of that plot. 
I admit to having assumed that the whole green rectangle was the plot and not just the area occupied by the pink house. Not blaming anyone. I just think that plots need to be clearly marked. may be by fences.


[07/31/2022 7:59 AM] koutelier#0000

so this nft goes to this plot .

(re @odiseus_me : *Nice fences‚Ä¶ I am happy to make them.*) 
 
 you are right


[07/31/2022 8:01 AM] koutelier#0000
something needs to be done.


[07/31/2022 8:01 AM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @koutelier : *a map with all the plots and nfts coordinates will be better i believe*) 
 
 Whatever works - but plots should be marked so that buyers and renters don‚Äôt need to guess or assume anything.

(re @odiseus_me : *Whatever works - but plots should be marked so that buyers and renters don‚Äôt need to guess or assume anything.*) 
 
 the map would be more clear imo


[07/31/2022 8:02 AM] koutelier#0000
(re @nirvanush : *Here is the map of the areas so far!

https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/active?type=all&sortKey=0&artist=9gdD4EmYjvKXCzgsQNHVFwcFrQ5vxqCWf6k2i4tFn7zwQhDATo8*) 
 
 something like that but not only with areas but also with plots could work


[07/31/2022 8:03 AM] koutelier#0000
what do you think ?


[07/31/2022 8:04 AM] koutelier#0000
and a button in the website that will redirect you to that map


[07/31/2022 8:09 AM] nirvanush#0000
When a new plot is listed for sale it has a border on the map so the first buyer see what he is buying. When the plot has no model you see a construction site. Construction site has borders for the whole perimeter of the plot, so it‚Äôs clear too. When owner put a model on the plot there are no borders, because it‚Äôs owner‚Äôs decision


[07/31/2022 8:12 AM] nirvanush#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *Wow‚Ä¶ I assumed that the plot was the piece of green that is surrounded by a light grey strip. I am really pissed off now‚Ä¶*) 
 
 Sorry you are pissed off, but it‚Äôs kinda clear..


[07/31/2022 8:20 AM] nirvanush#0000
We will add some kind of a map with all the plots borders so it will be more clear for anyone


[07/31/2022 8:54 AM] odiseus_me#0000

 You are explaining all this to someone who is angry, pissed off and feels like an idiot. I have spent a lot of money and the whole day yesterday trying to figure out why for fuck sake everything that I do snaps to a square (that I now realize is the plot); plus spent other people‚Äôs time on this (thanks @koutelier) so saying it‚Äôs clear doesn‚Äôt cut it. It obviously was not clear to me‚Ä¶
What does cut it is a very simple phrase: ‚ÄúI see you are angry/frustrated/pissed off, I apologize that this was not made clear to you; we‚Äôll fix it‚Äù. 
That is all‚Ä¶


[07/31/2022 8:55 AM] odiseus_me#0000
But you already said most of it. So I‚Äôm going to chill off now.

 so... projecting text on a "screen"/billboard, etc. - does that require reloading the model each time I like to present new text for example? how does the text dragged by the plane change? same thing - whole model is reloaded?

[08/01/2022 12:54 PM] nirvanush#0000
(re @dadreboi : *Kk ty. Any roadmap to do so?*) 
 
 Nope, not planned right now. Loading images from external sources is not a good idea for any website and sv is not an exclusion. You will have to use the tools that are currentlyavailable

[08/13/2022 12:52 PM] koutelier#0000
What? So big ?


[08/13/2022 12:53 PM] koutelier#0000

no 5?


[08/13/2022 12:55 PM] JOFLITO#0000
is a stupid box where you put your whole printer


[08/13/2022 12:55 PM] JOFLITO#0000
keeps filament dry, and temperature more constant


[08/13/2022 12:57 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @C4lculista : *is a stupid box where you put your whole printer*) 
 
 this comes with the printer ?

[08/13/2022 9:41 PM] Darkkknight111#0000
you have to calibrate 2 times, in cycle


[08/13/2022 9:41 PM] Darkkknight111#0000
1 2 3 4 then 1 2 3 4


[08/13/2022 9:42 PM] Darkkknight111#0000
becuase when u set 1 2 ...., 3 ,4  changes height..

[08/14/2022 12:16 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
The paper thing works good usually


[08/14/2022 12:20 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
My model has an auto leveler you run after manually leveling that probes the bed at 16 points and adjusts the rest in software.


[08/14/2022 12:20 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Of course I wasted an 8 hour day trying to get it to work and first only to find out the firmware they shipped was bugged


[08/14/2022 12:23 AM] koutelier#0000
(re @FidgetyRat : *Of course I wasted an 8 hour day trying to get it to work and first only to find out the firmware they shipped was bugged*)

I read about that as well


[08/14/2022 12:23 AM] koutelier#0000
Because after the first Layer it goes crazy


[08/14/2022 1:32 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Mine was referring to the auto leveling. Not printing.


[08/14/2022 1:33 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
One thing a lot of people forget about is that leveling the printer to the head (paper trick, auto levelers, etc) make sure the bed and head are in alignment. If the desk it‚Äôs sitting on is not level you‚Äôre SOL lol.


[08/14/2022 1:33 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
But it certainly helps to make sure you have the latest firmware. They do fix a lot of bugs.

 He extruded filament looks to melty to my eye, dont you think so?


[08/14/2022 8:55 AM] Darkkknight111#0000
And one of the things causinc you problem can be a less adhesion or your bed, use the hair spray so the print can stick to the bed , so if the nozzel stucks with print,It does take the print with it


[08/14/2022 10:33 AM] koutelier#0000

[08/14/2022 11:54 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
(re @Darkkknight111 : *He extruded filament looks to melty to my eye, dont you think so?*) 
 
 Based on just the video alone and not seeing the model or what‚Äôs left of it after It looks a bit overextruded. I do my PLA around 195 but he can also dial back the extrusion in the slicer to 95% or so to see if there‚Äôs improvement.


[08/14/2022 11:54 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
May not be temperature but an overzealous extruded feed

1/2New tresure hunt address. 

So few people asked to drop the address for the treasure hunt earlier so more people donate if they like.
So this is the new address:

@FidgetyRat your bag was with the extruder ?


[08/14/2022 5:52 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
No my bug was with my models auto leveling routine. Normally after leveling manually you run this mode and it proves the bed and makes software adjustments to fine tune. It failed every time until I updated the firmware.

(re @koutelier : *Yeah I did made few tweets and post in ergo socials few days before the treasure hunt but I could do start a new treasure hunt address in few days*) 
 
 I see. Well if you do decide to try out my suggestion, you would put the idea out there that everyone can send crypto to that address in advance. So just putting the address out there does make it possible to do that, but that is still a step down from encouraging people to donate toward the pot. I guess it does potentially encourage scammers to do the same though with their own addresses. Would have to be careful.

 so what do you suggest sir?


[08/16/2022 4:16 AM] stillDreamy#0000
(re @koutelier : *so what do you suggest sir?*) 
 
 Just that you could include a message to the community suggesting they can donate by sending crypto to the address in advance if they want to. Perhaps even certain sponsors might agree to match the donations that make it in there by some cutoff date, perhaps up to some maximum amount. The idea is basically just to make it more fun for the treasure hunters by possibly making the pot larger by making it more of a decentralized donation into the address. The main concern people might have is how do we know the contest is not rigged or run by scammers, like people on the inside could remove the funds before someone gets into it. I'm not sure what to do about that part or if it is worth worrying about or not.

Difference is a good sheet of paper from center to edge

Needs to be on the exact same level with the nozzle ?

Never got one,but I think no


[08/24/2022 4:21 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
(re @koutelier : *Needs to be on the exact same level with the nozzle ?*) 
 
 Doesn‚Äôt need to be. Should be lower so the probe strikes first. You‚Äôd probably never make it perfectly aligned to nozzle and nozzles change size.


[08/24/2022 4:21 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
After you use it to level you need to set your Z offset with paper method


[08/24/2022 4:21 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
The probe will level the bed but set the z=0 to itself which will be wrong.


[08/24/2022 4:22 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Z offset is the difference between the probe and the actual nozzle which can really only be felt with paper

i feel like NFT rental/lending would be a cool thing to see on skyharbor

(re @NoahErgo : *@nirvanush is renting contract open source?*) 
 
 I believe it is

Also skyharbor wanted to do something like that as well so I guess they will add that feature at some point

(re @NoahErgo : *ah cool thank you*) 
 
 We‚Äôve talked with @KrasaviceBlasen about a possibility to implement partial ownership via SkyHarbor one day. On our end we could allow multiple people to get an access to a plot


[09/02/2022 8:57 AM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @nirvanush : *We‚Äôve talked with @KrasaviceBlasen about a possibility to implement partial ownership via SkyHarbor one day. On our end we could allow multiple people to get an access to a plot*) 
 
 How would it work between the joint owners? Needs to be a set of rules/an agreement about what can‚Äôt and can‚Äôt be done. Otherwise this will be limited to only groups of good friends (perhaps even for friends this could be problematic without rules/agreement); a DAO?

 What do you mean rules ?


[09/02/2022 9:00 AM] koutelier#0000
If someone rents or buy the plot he can deploy whatever he wants .


[09/02/2022 9:01 AM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @koutelier : *What do you mean rules ?*) 
 
 I mean between the partial owners


[09/02/2022 9:01 AM] koutelier#0000
I guess the plot will be divided


[09/02/2022 9:01 AM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @koutelier : *If someone rents or buy the plot he can deploy whatever he wants .*) 
 
 If you and I are partners in a plot - how do we manage it


[09/02/2022 9:01 AM] koutelier#0000
So would be two different or more plots


[09/02/2022 9:02 AM] koutelier#0000
I don‚Äôt know how exactly this will work but I imagine something like that


[09/02/2022 9:02 AM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @koutelier : *I guess the plot will be divided*) 
 
 That‚Äôs one way of doing it. But


[09/02/2022 9:02 AM] odiseus_me#0000
But if you can split a plot why bother about joint ownership?


[09/02/2022 9:03 AM] koutelier#0000
Wdym?


[09/02/2022 9:03 AM] koutelier#0000
Co buy a plot you mean ?


[09/02/2022 9:06 AM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @koutelier : *Co buy a plot you mean ?*) 
 
 I mean - if you are talking about joint ownership- you needs rules or a contract to handle it (between the joint owners);
If you are talking about buying and splitting - then first split and then sell to two buyers. No need for joint ownership.


[09/02/2022 9:08 AM] koutelier#0000
Joint renting not joint buying a plot . We talk about the same thing ?


[09/02/2022 9:09 AM] koutelier#0000
What the rules will be for ?


[09/02/2022 9:10 AM] odiseus_me#0000
Joint management of this asset. You live in a house or have a plot with someone - how do you decide on things?


[09/02/2022 9:13 AM] nirvanush#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *How would it work between the joint owners? Needs to be a set of rules/an agreement about what can‚Äôt and can‚Äôt be done. Otherwise this will be limited to only groups of good friends (perhaps even for friends this could be problematic without rules/agreement); a DAO?*) 
 
 I like to start simple. People organize their work as they want. WhatsApp group, tg group.


[09/02/2022 9:14 AM] nirvanush#0000
People in group will own an NFT that repsent a part of the plot, not a specific part, just a %


[09/02/2022 9:14 AM] nirvanush#0000
While the real plot nft will be locked in SC


[09/02/2022 9:15 AM] nirvanush#0000
Anyone with a partial plot will have a full access


[09/02/2022 9:15 AM] nirvanush#0000
And ability to change the plot


[09/02/2022 9:16 AM] nirvanush#0000
This is a POC that i can roll out fast to check the demand


[09/02/2022 9:17 AM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @nirvanush : *And ability to change the plot*) 
 
 So here is the first challenge


[09/02/2022 9:18 AM] odiseus_me#0000
You and I own 50% of a plot
You want to lease it while I want to built a house.


[09/02/2022 9:20 AM] nirvanush#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *You and I own 50% of a plot
You want to lease it while I want to built a house.*) 
 
 Yeah I understand, legit question. But it‚Äôs not a problem until it‚Äôs a problem.
You cross a bridge only when you get to it, not before


[09/02/2022 9:20 AM] odiseus_me#0000
Or, we build a house together on this plot that we own together; I want to sell my 50% - am I free to sell it to anyone? Do I have to offer it to you first? At what price? Do I have to offer you to join me in selling my 50%?


[09/02/2022 9:21 AM] nirvanush#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *Or, we build a house together on this plot that we own together; I want to sell my 50% - am I free to sell it to anyone? Do I have to offer it to you first? At what price? Do I have to offer you to join me in selling my 50%?*) 
 
 You can sell your part it‚Äôs just an NFT


[09/02/2022 9:21 AM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @nirvanush : *Yeah I understand, legit question. But it‚Äôs not a problem until it‚Äôs a problem.
You cross a bridge only when you get to it, not before*) 
 
 The moment two people (or more) share a piece of property - these questions will come up. I say - build it right - from the start.


[09/02/2022 9:22 AM] nirvanush#0000
In any case i bet people will try to buy with people they know to ensure they are on the same page regarding their investment strategy


[09/02/2022 9:23 AM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @nirvanush : *You can sell your part it‚Äôs just an NFT*) 
 
 Ya, but you and I spent a month putting together this house; I need the money, so I want to sell my 50% and the new buyer doesn‚Äôt care for the house - he want to put a billboard instead


[09/02/2022 9:23 AM] nirvanush#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *The moment two people (or more) share a piece of property - these questions will come up. I say - build it right - from the start.*) 
 
 It‚Äôs not how you do it in start ups. I don‚Äôt want to invest a lot of resources before i get first feedback and check my assumptions.


[09/02/2022 9:23 AM] nirvanush#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *Ya, but you and I spent a month putting together this house; I need the money, so I want to sell my 50% and the new buyer doesn‚Äôt care for the house - he want to put a billboard instead*) 
 
 This is just a theory, it has to be checked before you develop a whole solution


[09/02/2022 9:24 AM] nirvanush#0000
You can check it only when your mvp meets the real user


[09/02/2022 9:25 AM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @nirvanush : *It‚Äôs not how you do it in start ups. I don‚Äôt want to invest a lot of resources before i get first feedback and check my assumptions.*) 
 
 Go ahead my friend. My humble suggestion - make it just a little more than ‚Äúlet‚Äôs buy this plot together ‚Äú


[09/02/2022 9:29 AM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @nirvanush : *And ability to change the plot*) 
 
 I mean just this for example - if you and I hold 50% and I want to change the plot, and you do not? What do we do? If you own 60% and I 40% - then can you decide alone?


[09/02/2022 9:39 AM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @nirvanush : *You can check it only when your mvp meets the real user*) 
 
 You can count on one thing only - if you build it - I‚Äôm in‚Ä¶


[09/02/2022 9:47 AM] nirvanush#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *I mean just this for example - if you and I hold 50% and I want to change the plot, and you do not? What do we do? If you own 60% and I 40% - then can you decide alone?*) 
 
 It‚Äôs a possible. But what if you want to upload something and your 60% owner has just disappeared (aka long holder) or lost an access to his wallet, or burned his share due to some wallet bug? Other participants will loose an access too. So i better assume for the beginning that people know how to organize themselves and talk to each other


[09/02/2022 9:48 AM] nirvanush#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *You can count on one thing only - if you build it - I‚Äôm in‚Ä¶*) 
 
 Thanks! It‚Äôs more depends on SkyHarbor at the moment. After that i can implement on SV the access part

 No, but we were trying to brute it. Someone else still got to it first before the group I was with. After the last hunt, I made the program 5.6 times faster. It's a cool program because it can be used to recover a partially lost/wrong seed phrase. You can also make a custom list of words when you know that for word 3 for example, it might be word A, B, or C. This helped with the hunt if there were multiple interpretations for a clue. It also can help people that have a word written down that is not completely legible and could be a few different words.

Will there be any limitations on what the words might be? Last time we knew they were limited to the official Ergo mnemonic word list. From a treasure hunting perspective, this was both a blessing and a curse. It helped us know we did not come up with the correct interpretation of a clue if it did not match to a word. But it also caused us to look at other possible words from the list and really think if any of them might make sense, and sometimes there were multiple that could make sense. Maybe made us over think it...

Eww. I just had a cool idea. What if the clues are questions about the projects sponsoring the hunt? They could be designed to get people to learn more about those projects. Each sponsoring project could pick something about themselves they want others to know and turn that into a clue.

 Same issue. About 15 cors errors and never loads. Had to turn off web security. This was a common occurrence for me with the cloud servers on east coast USA.


[09/16/2022 11:06 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
For whatever reason whatever server my browser connects to takes days to properly sync with the rest of the cluster.

 Okay thanks. I'll have to look for that setting in Brave. Web security, ya?


[09/16/2022 12:25 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Unfortunately it‚Äôs annoying. It‚Äôs not a normal setting. You need to launch it from command line with 2 arguments. One to disable web security and another to change the user data dir. if both aren‚Äôt present brave ignores.


[09/16/2022 12:26 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Unfortunately changing the data dir is like running a new browser with no wallets or extensions.  To get around that I set the data dir to a bad location it can‚Äôt read and it gives up and defaults to its normal data dir but allowing the security to be turned off


[09/16/2022 12:27 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
I‚Äôll post the command I use once I get to the office

They said the hunt started so i assumed that meant the words were there to find

Yeah almost all the words are out


[09/16/2022 4:21 PM] koutelier#0000
By the end of the day all words will be available for finding . Be careful few words from the last treasure hunt are still deployed inside the valley plots

 the owl's words are not in the phrase Ergo buddy


[09/20/2022 9:22 AM] koutelier#0000
The words are random words not from the phrase list . Could be anything . The number before the word or question or riddle represents the right order of the word


[09/20/2022 9:22 AM] koutelier#0000
You have to input the words on: sigmavalley.org/hunt


[09/20/2022 9:22 AM] koutelier#0000
And then the real seed phrases  will pop up

Last sold was something like 700 erg at the time.

Anything in auction house is likely fake.

@nirvanush would be cool to let people buy lottery tickets or at least show stats on the valley

Note: You have to turn on Developer mode in the settings in Ledger Live. Keep in mind this is still experimental mode so heed precautions.

 Didn‚Äôt undergo final scans by ledger but deemed good enough based on past. Plus it‚Äôs open source In Git hub so if it had issues someone would have seen it


[01/10/2023 8:39 PM] FidgetyRat#0000

[01/13/2023 7:52 AM] nirvanush#0000
Worst time to poke me üòÖ. I‚Äôm super busy at my job and there is nothing i can do about it. 
Currently the biggest challenge for SV is to improve performance so more people can run it on their computers and we can add more plots.
Not sure i can allocate any mental power for SV in the near future. But i don‚Äôt want to give up.
I‚Äôve renewed SV domain, the project is running and will keep running. Anyone with NFT has an access to his property and can do whatever he wants.
To rephrase one famous guy: took as much responsibility of SV as you want.

 Is this something you see lasting long term? Happy to keep plugging on the plots and playing but as you said there‚Äôs a lot of work to be done on it still.

And creat stuff


[01/15/2023 10:11 AM] hq3r#0000
And then get a cut from the monthly rent


[01/15/2023 10:11 AM] hq3r#0000

Artists who can place designs on plots


[01/15/2023 10:14 AM] hq3r#0000
And if someone rents or buy


[01/15/2023 10:14 AM] hq3r#0000
Plot


[01/15/2023 10:15 AM] hq3r#0000
Get the % of sale / rent


[01/15/2023 1:08 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
I don‚Äôt really get it to be honest


[01/15/2023 1:09 PM] hq3r#0000
(re @FidgetyRat : *I don‚Äôt really get it to be honest*) 
 
 If you have plot, you can hire an builder to build ...u either  pay him for the build or cut on when plot is sold or rent


[01/15/2023 1:09 PM] hq3r#0000
Better?


[01/15/2023 1:10 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
If the plot is sold or rented everything on it gets overwritten. So why would it matter what a designer put on it


[01/15/2023 1:10 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
People rent to build not say they own someone else‚Äôs temporary model


[01/15/2023 1:10 PM] hq3r#0000
(re @FidgetyRat : *If the plot is sold or rented everything on it gets overwritten. So why would it matter what a designer put on it*) 
 
 Maybe you can creat "keep plot as it is" o" default "value when auctioned


[01/15/2023 1:10 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Unless there was a new mode on plots


[01/15/2023 1:11 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
New mode could allow a lock on the model like an NFT, but that can be risky.
