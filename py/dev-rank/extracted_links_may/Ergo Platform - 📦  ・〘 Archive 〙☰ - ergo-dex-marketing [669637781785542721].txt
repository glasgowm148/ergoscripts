Together with Denis we are finishing DEX implementation using ErgoTool CLI.
Here is the road map https://github.com/aslesarenko/ergo-tool/issues/22
This week we plan to finish commands implementation and have blog-post draft.
Depending of review and testing somewhere next week we can publish this in the blog.
In addition to that I think it make sense do additional marketing activities. 
In particular we may do some price pumping, twitting campaign, etc.

[01/22/2020 9:25 PM] morphic#4133
So this channel is to discuss this campain mostly.


[01/22/2020 9:26 PM] morphic#4133
Changed the name accordingly


[01/22/2020 9:27 PM] mx#5165
Blog post should focus strictly on real dex possibilities with Ergo


[01/22/2020 9:28 PM] mx#5165
This is very important in the whole cryptocurrency space


[01/22/2020 9:30 PM] morphic#4133
Yes, fully trustless based on atomic swap example in Sigma.
also I'm in favor of extending the scope of this roadmap, to include also implementation of simple Web Page which shows current DEX order book. 
This is easy to do, doesn't require any keys, and will be helpful to find orders and run CLI commands


[01/22/2020 9:31 PM] morphic#4133
We can ask Dmitry Usov to create such page

[01/22/2020 9:33 PM] mx#5165
Yes, it should be marketed as one of the major Ergo products,  lots of people made a career with it in the last decade while having a trash product. We need to put focus on atomic exchange in the core and also on atomic exchange with different cryptocurrencies, there is offchain decentralized matching also i assume?


[01/22/2020 9:34 PM] mx#5165
We need to explain every single element in detail when it comes to Ergo DEX


[01/22/2020 9:35 PM] mx#5165
Then also people will start learning about other properties


[01/22/2020 9:35 PM] morphic#4133
Current implementation will be very basic, but hopefully useful. Other features may come later.


[01/22/2020 9:36 PM] mx#5165
Yes i know but we need to explain possibilities in details with first post


[01/22/2020 9:37 PM] mx#5165
web page with order book would be huge marketing stunt at the same time

[01/22/2020 9:38 PM] morphic#4133
Yeah, that is the goal of this channel. I will create some draft ASAP, and share here.


[01/22/2020 9:41 PM] mx#5165
That`s how i think about it - Priceless, if it is a truly decentralized exchange where different protocols could be built on top of the atomic exchange with the possibility of transactions being sent off-chain and posted next on the blockchain along with the exchange transaction


[01/22/2020 9:42 PM] mx#5165
we need to put at the same time things like no bloat etc


[01/22/2020 9:42 PM] mx#5165
the problems most blockchains have problems while creating dex


[01/22/2020 9:43 PM] mx#5165
while having fully decentralized exchange


[01/22/2020 9:44 PM] mx#5165
no centralized gateways etc


[01/22/2020 9:44 PM] mx#5165
offchain protocols, this post needs to be superb


[01/22/2020 9:45 PM] mx#5165
and finished with single web page just made with some style


[01/22/2020 9:48 PM] mx#5165
more privacy sigma magic may be added to it also for sure


[01/22/2020 9:48 PM] mx#5165
we need to market whole platform through this post


[01/22/2020 9:55 PM] mx#5165
there will be coinall listing, we can possibly combine these two events in not long distance


[01/23/2020 6:27 AM] morphic#4133
Oh, I'm not sure we should try to put all this in the same post, I think it better fits into a series of posts, the first one is opening the topic and then we can come up with new ones in the sequel.


[01/23/2020 6:32 AM] mx#5165
we can by simple sentences, it will be explained next in the series of posts

Block DX | Block DX
Block DX is the fastest, most secure, most reliable, and most decentralized exchange (DEX), utilizing cross-chain atomic swaps powered by the Blocknet Protocol.
https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/vys4E3DR2By-e6TPibZjh-Hd89Dk_Lbnu6ibx8Ztx3o/https/blockdx.com/assets/img/blockdx-preview.png


[01/23/2020 7:02 AM] mx#5165
Why Block DX
Many exchanges claim to be decentralized while hiding the details of centralized components. Block DX is the only exchange that decentralizes every component.
Decentralized. Trustless. Secure. Private. Open. Uncensored. Unstoppable.


[01/23/2020 7:02 AM] mx#5165
Decentralized Order Books
Traders broadcast their orders over a peer-to-peer network and each trader compiles the orderbook locally themselves. Unlike on-chain order books which enable frontrunning, with Block DX no one can get orders faster than anyone else by being closer to the server, since there is no server.

Decentralized Order Matching
All order matching is performed locally. As an order is taken, Block DX automatically begins communicating with the counterparty over the peer-to-peer network to conduct the trade. No third parties control this, all action is self-sovereign.

Non-custodial
Trading occurs directly from your own wallets and your funds remain in your control throughout the entire trade process. This means there's no third-party control over your funds, no need to transfer funds to another account, no waiting for deposit or withdrawal confirmations, and no withdrawal limits.


[01/23/2020 7:03 AM] mx#5165
Trustless
Block DX allows you to securely trade with no middlemen or intermediaries, keeping you in control of your funds throughout the entire trade process. All trading logic, operations, verifications, and checks are also performed locally.

Private
No accounts, KYC, AML, or registration process are required since trading is purely peer-to-peer. As a result, no legal responsibility is created that would require registration to use Block DX. This protects your personal privacy and gives you true financial freedom.

Native Assets, On-chain
No wrapped proxy tokens or coloured coins are used in place of native assets. Many "DEXes" give you a wrapped marker (e.g. wBTC) to represent your real funds (e.g. BTC). This removes your sovereignty over your funds and requires you to trust this entity, smart contract, or third-party chain.


[01/23/2020 7:03 AM] mx#5165
Instant Trades
Trades on Block DX are extremely fast. Many people believe that atomic swaps means that the trades are slow, but that depends on implementation. With Block DX the trade times are independent of the block times of the assets being traded.

Open Source
Block DX is entirely open source, enabling the community to review, audit, and contribute to Block DX freely and transparently. As a result, you may subject the code to high levels of scrutiny to satisfy your need for security no matter how high your standards are.

Uncensored
Listings and access to the exchange are open and uncensored. There are no restrictions on what users or regions have access to the exchange since there are no accounts and trading is decentralized. Listings are also decentralized with no single party that controls what assets can be traded.


[01/23/2020 7:03 AM] mx#5165
Lower Fees
On Block DX there are lower trading fees and no withdrawal fee since trades are conducted directly from your wallets. While there are network fees of the assets being traded, this is a fee that exists when sending funds to and from other exchange addresses.

Unstoppable
Block DX is always online since it doesn't require accounts or any central entity to function. The true peer-to-peer nature of the exchange makes it impossible to shut down, offers zero downtime, and built-in DoS protection.

Atomic Swaps
Trade settlement is decentralized through the use of atomic swaps. Atomic swaps control the exchange of funds between you and your counterparty and are completely "trustless", meaning that you can safely trade with anyone without having to trust their intentions.


[01/23/2020 7:03 AM] mx#5165
Fee Sharing
Some protocols return profits to a company or developer team, but this is a rent-seeking activity that enriches a central actor and does not fairly distribute fees. With Block DX, 100% of trade fees are distributed among nodes on the network. No trade fees are paid to a central entity.

Cross-chain
There are no restrictions to only trading assets of a certain chain. You can trade between Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dash, Syscoin, Digibyte, and more than 100 other assets from different blockchains with complete trading pair freedom. Block DX aims to integrate all platforms and assets.

Liquidity Network
Block DX is powered by the Blocknet Protocol. All services using the Blocknet Protocol have a shared order book and contribute to the same liquidity pool, including Block DX. This creates a network effect for liquidity.

@morphic where the webpage will be hosted?


[01/23/2020 8:33 AM] kushti#0978
ah I see


[01/23/2020 8:33 AM] morphic#4133
I suggest In the explorer, see #deleted-channel for discussion


[01/23/2020 8:33 AM] kushti#0978
explorer


[01/23/2020 8:33 AM] kushti#0978
good


[01/23/2020 10:28 AM] mx#5165
probably first post should be something like POC and then we can say next stages are etc


[01/23/2020 10:31 AM] kushti#0978
should we sell formal verification a lot ?


[01/23/2020 10:31 AM] kushti#0978
any issues happened with DEX contracts ?


[01/23/2020 10:31 AM] kushti#0978
on Eth


[01/23/2020 10:43 AM] mx#5165
if i see correctly, they are doing formal verification but for ethereum 2.0 üôÇ


[01/23/2020 10:44 AM] mx#5165
so we should probably push formal verification for pow a lot


[01/23/2020 10:50 AM] mx#5165
ethereum will rather fall into waves category


[01/23/2020 11:01 AM] kushti#0978
maybe formal verif is covering more with our simple approach


[01/23/2020 12:35 PM] mx#5165
that`s for sure, i mean we should probably focus more on blockchains not switching to POS
