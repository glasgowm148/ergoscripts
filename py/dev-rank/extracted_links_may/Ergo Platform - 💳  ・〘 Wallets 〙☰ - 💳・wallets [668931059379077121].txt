What does secured means?


[02/06/2020 10:47 AM] kushti#0978
@Dmitry Meshkov Ergo Foundation or me personally will secure success of the campaign )

We'll consider this)


[02/06/2020 10:49 AM] kushti#0978
not so much needed, website or GH with checksumed binaries, instructions, descriptions etc


[02/06/2020 10:50 AM] kushti#0978
currently only people who follow the project for long time and know your name will put assets into binaries from twitter I guess

[04/08/2020 10:36 AM] jasondavies#8712
@greenhat great! yes, tx serialisation and deserialisation, value serialisation and deserialisation


[04/08/2020 11:46 AM] greenhat#6562
@jasondavies Do you have an API in mind? My C is very rusty. üôÇ


[04/08/2020 12:43 PM] jasondavies#8712
Don't worry about C API, I can write a wrapper


[04/08/2020 1:40 PM] greenhat#6562
@jasondavies Ok I‚Äôll start drafting the API. How do you plan to use it? I‚Äôd like to know your use cases. Like for example for value serialization. I suppose you want to extract/store  ‚Äúconstants‚Äù(values , arrays?) rather than whole ErgoTree. I don‚Äôt have experience developing for hardware wallets, I‚Äôm trying to guess your most pressing needs.


[04/08/2020 1:51 PM] jasondavies#8712
I guess value serialisation isn't that important for the hardware wallet - bear in mind that initially I only really need to support creating proofs for "simple" transactions i.e. spending boxes protected by a single PK. So it wouldn't need to parse arbitrary values for this purpose.


[04/08/2020 1:52 PM] jasondavies#8712
But I was thinking a Rust library for values would be useful in many contexts including web wallets (WASM) and others. So it would be a matter of translating the Value types into Rust, implementing ser/deser for each type.


[04/08/2020 1:53 PM] jasondavies#8712
Eventually I would expect we can use it on the hardware wallet but it's not absolutely necessary especially right now as I want it to be as restrictive as possible in the types of transactions it supports


[04/08/2020 2:08 PM] Robert K#0722
Nice, I think this is a great decision to have a sigma-rust module for long-term interoperability.

[04/08/2020 2:13 PM] Robert K#0722
Hmm, I wonder if a rewrite of some of the computation-heavy parts of sigma in Rust and then using it with JNI can end up being a potential performance improvement.


[04/08/2020 2:31 PM] morphic#4133
@greenhat @jasondavies Taking about porting Sigma to Rust, I suggest to consider auto-generation of all ErgoTree nodes and serialisers. 
This is possible, because the serialisation formats for all ErgoTree nodes  in ErgoTree spec document are fully auto-generated. So the metadata is enough to generate both IR and all the serializers.


[04/08/2020 2:37 PM] morphic#4133
Existing generators can be used for inspiration


[04/08/2020 3:01 PM] greenhat#6562
@jasondavies Ok, Values(trees) with serializer/deserializer seems like a worthy goal. It's still quite unclear if all Value types(lambda, etc.) should be exposed in the public API. I mean exposing ErgoTree nodes via C bindings sounds scary :). It seems clients would want to interpret an ErgoTree rather than just get it. Or maybe they just want to parse constants from serialized ErgoTree.
I'd rather start with something simple to get my feet wet in Rust. What about tx deserialization? Sounds like a easier task. Read and write boxes and tx properties, right?


[04/08/2020 3:06 PM] greenhat#6562
How does similar libraries looks in other blockchains?


[04/08/2020 3:06 PM] jasondavies#8712
@greenhat OK, sounds good. Let's start there and see how we get on. But I wouldn't worry too much about a C API as it's likely that users of this library might want to use it via Rust and expose their own API over FFI. So if the library is pure Rust, I can always write a wrapper that parses a transaction, does some checks and then returns some components to the caller over FFI.


[04/08/2020 3:09 PM] jasondavies#8712

> Hmm, I wonder if a rewrite of some of the computation-heavy parts of sigma in Rust and then using it with JNI can end up being a potential performance improvement.
@Robert K Hot paths were heavily optimized for JVM by @morphic in a ways that I never though were possible. üí™   But yeah, JNI will be a nice option if we find something faster.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[04/08/2020 4:02 PM] morphic#4133
@Robert K I'm quite skeptical about potential speedups from just offloading Java to native. 
1) it should be coarse grained parts, to amortise the overhead of JNI itself
2) Java is really fast when it comes to throughput (not latency), in which case GC will not be an issue as it can be done concurrently and in parallel 
3) Existing ErgoTree has still further optimization potential, so even if the new Rust implementation will be faster, then the advantage may vanish after those optimizations are done in original sigma.
4) Most expensive part is crypto operations, BigInt, ECPoint etc. If Rust version will be based on SIMD processors instructions, then maybe we can expect 2-3x performance speedup of those crypto ops. Assuming crypto is 50% of total script evaluation, we can expect 25-40% speedup from SIMD


[04/08/2020 4:06 PM] morphic#4133
There are cases when offloading to native really wins: 
1) huge arrays > 4Gb
2) number crunching with SIMD


[04/08/2020 4:08 PM] morphic#4133
However, Java is evolving, and I remember Intel contributed SIMD support to Hotspot, I'm not 100% sure about it though


[04/08/2020 4:13 PM] morphic#4133
So, maybe crypto part can be off-loaded, but it make sense to do benchmarking first


[04/08/2020 5:28 PM] Robert K#0722
Ah interesting, thank you for the detailed response, it was more so just a thought but good to know that the current implementation isn't orders of magntiude slower or anything. I think optimizations really don't matter at all at this point anyways since functionality is what is going to drive usage of smart contracts/Ergo. Once the network starts to have several dApps running daily, then maybe it can be worth focusing resources on seriously optimizing imo.

@gtklocker take a look to https://github.com/coinbarn/coinbarn-extension/issues/9.
There are 2 main issues there as far as I remember - 
1. Css should be fixed to make it looks similar to Chrome
2. User is logged out when closing the extension in Firefox. Looks like a solution we used to keep user logged in Crome don't work in Firefox, so it will require a bit more rework

coinbarn just takes transactions from the explorer and performs no other verification, correct?

so it doesn't know of any chain or such

@gtklocker do you mean we we integrating SPV or NiPoPoW? Not for the initial implementation but it's something we'd like to add for future iterations. Strictly speaking there's no reason we can't add support for it, but it just makes more sense for us to release Ergo support to all our users first and then add more functionality as we go

@kushti we've spent a crazy amount of time with Yoroi just pleasing reviewers for both the mobile and browser extension. Sometimes there is just no message and you re-submit and it gets accepted and you wasted a week for nothing. Sometimes you get a message where they don't understand blockchain and they ask for clarification on various points


[06/10/2020 8:41 AM] kushti#0978

@Sebastien but do they remove Yoroi during an update ?


[06/10/2020 10:01 AM] Sebastien#0653
@kushti yes, they usually only review when you push new updates


[06/10/2020 10:01 AM] Sebastien#0653
so if you have an aggressive release schedule, you increase the chance of your app randomly being removed just due to probability

@Sebastien How do you plan to add ERG support in Yoroi? We have sigma-rust in the works - https://github.com/ergoplatform/sigma-rust/milestones . It will cover tx signing for JS, iOS and Android. /cc @kushti @morphic

[06/14/2020 10:32 PM] kushti#0978
@Sebastien no )


[06/20/2020 2:18 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
@Dmitry Meshkov can you help me understand? Why generated wallet at panel with mnemonic `rather boost dolphin fitness giggle mutual wreck raise attack section click motor waste torch sock` gave wallet address `9iFiKozaeZZwMshrQMC6VCt1A1Z1dZqsC5ypiHcHEZByZUS5acW` but at coinbarn wallet - also with this mnemonic - gave me address `9fe5D6VQk15RZxUjLTNdxxgeYqysP1oSxphjL5qFYWNeeViRAPb`?


[06/20/2020 2:22 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
and vice versa -  if I create a new address in coinbarn, it gives me a mnemonic with one address, and this mnemonic in the node's `/panel` gives a different address.


[06/20/2020 2:24 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
It turns out that I can‚Äôt get access coins in node's panel if I created a wallet at the coinbarn and vice versa?


[06/20/2020 2:30 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Because coinbarn uses EIP-03 https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/blob/master/eip-0003.md, while node generates legacy keys.


[06/20/2020 2:30 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
I remember @kushti told about plans to support EIP-03 in the node, not sure what is the current status


[06/20/2020 2:31 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
thanks


[06/20/2020 2:33 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
does this mean that if the node will move to the new standard, restore the first address fails and coins will lost?


[06/20/2020 2:34 PM] Robert K#0722
@kushti Said he's going to be working on adding support in the coming weeks I believe, as Yoroi will also be using EIP-3 and we want interoperability to be reached among the wallets.


[06/20/2020 2:35 PM] Robert K#0722
@Dmitry Usov I think the idea was to support the old standard and the new? Or potentially migrating people? I'm not sure what the expected update ramp is going to be in that regard.


[06/20/2020 2:35 PM] Robert K#0722
Or maybe when restoring mnemonic there could theoretically be an extra field to specify "old" derivation or "new" derivation


[06/20/2020 6:09 PM] kushti#0978

[06/27/2020 5:27 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
When you send a new transaction, the old explorer returned it id wrapped with `"` (like a node does), so it looked like `"1e070af1b6e0ff044f40388e9933496e2ebcb092c691e04e3e07e35550f275a9"`, so I had to remove the first `"` symbol to get an id. When explorer back was updated, it started to return it without `"` symbols, which broke compartibility, that's we had to update Coinbarn.


[06/27/2020 5:29 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652

@Sebastien why not to use blake2b256 instead of blake2b512 + fnv1_32 ?

@kushti
> We don't want to simply take the last 4 bytes of `hash1` because that would reveal part of the input used to generate the *ImagePart*. Although strictly speaking this should not be of a concern (since the result of `hash1` doesn't reveal any information about the original key), we take this as a precaution.


[07/04/2020 10:31 PM] Sebastien#0653
same argument applies if you generate the text part from blake2b256


[07/04/2020 10:34 PM] Sebastien#0653
I don't think there is a particular reason we chose 512 over 256 for the hash1. Probably we should switch to 256 since the image processing library projects down to 128 and the text part only uses 256

What was the logic for the value of `heightDelta=720` for ergo-ts? With the mining time at around ~2min/block it seems kind of large


[09/24/2020 8:06 AM] kushti#0978
@Sebastien is it for mining rewards maybe? @Dmitry Meshkov


[09/24/2020 8:07 AM] kushti#0978
Mining rewards can be withdrawn 720 blocks after


[09/24/2020 11:17 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Yeah, it's a workaround for mining reward scripts


[09/25/2020 10:04 AM] Sebastien#0653
I noticed ergo-ts has the recommended fee as `1100000` but sigma-rust has it as `1000000`. Any reason for the difference?


[09/25/2020 12:09 PM] greenhat#6562
@Sebastien  ~~I don‚Äôt think there is any reason. They both are safe. The actual minimal box value checked limit is 360 * box size in bytes.~~


[09/25/2020 12:11 PM] greenhat#6562
~~In the last sigma-rust update I made box creation reflect this and fail if the box value is too low.~~


[09/25/2020 1:34 PM] greenhat#6562
@Sebastien wait, you probably meant miner's fee in tx. I misread it as min box value. Please, ignore what I wrote.


[09/25/2020 1:38 PM] Sebastien#0653
I ask because in Yoroi we could build a UI for the user to explicitly specify a fee, but obviously most users would rather not have to deal with that. I'm not sure what is good to set as a default though


[09/25/2020 1:38 PM] greenhat#6562
Although I think using 1100000/100000 miner's fee in tx were "influenced" by box min value.


[09/25/2020 1:39 PM] Sebastien#0653
for the first release, all transactions out of Yoroi would only have 1 or 2 boxes (either send all or with a change box)


[09/25/2020 1:39 PM] Sebastien#0653
I would have expected there to be a min fee utility function in ergo-ts or sigma-rust but I couldn't find one


[09/25/2020 1:52 PM] greenhat#6562
@Sebastien I don't think we have any tx fee calculation algo anywhere.  Seems like we use safe min box value everywhere. I believe the miner's fee value is ignored by miners now since the emission is the main source of profit for them. @kushti right, or did I miss something?


[09/25/2020 2:00 PM] kushti#0978
@Sebastien @greenhat actually, miners are sorting mempool transactions by fee / byte (like in Bitcoin). There's PR for including fee estimation methods into the node: https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/pull/1175 . Currently good value is about 0.001 erg/ kilobyte (ErgoMixer is paying something like that). With node's default value of 0.001 erg regardless the size, a transaction can stay for a while in the mempool if it is e.g. collecting many inputs. Some exchanges paying 0.01 to get into a block ASAP.

[09/25/2020 2:03 PM] greenhat#6562
Nice! I'm including it in the sigma-rust roadmap then.


[09/25/2020 2:04 PM] Sebastien#0653
my understanding from reading sigma-rust is that there is a minimum fee though based on the number of bytes, right? Like you can't submit a 1 nanoErg tx fee since nodes will just reject it


[09/25/2020 2:05 PM] Sebastien#0653
and it looks like the sigma-rust txbuilder doesn't actually take that into account when building transaction and instead just takes in a static fee


[09/25/2020 2:07 PM] greenhat#6562
@Sebastien  min box value depends on box size. It's 360 nanoERGs per byte. sigma-rust's tx builder takes miner's fee as parameter now.


[09/25/2020 2:07 PM] greenhat#6562
360 is the current value, which can be voted up by miners.


[09/25/2020 2:10 PM] Sebastien#0653
the main concern I have is the edge case where adding a change output could increases the min fee to the point where the input is no longer enough to cover the min tx fee


[09/25/2020 2:17 PM] greenhat#6562
My understanding, that there is no hard minimum on tx fee. Tx with "low" fee will just stay longer in the mempool.


[09/25/2020 2:18 PM] Sebastien#0653
ah sorry, I misunderstood


[09/25/2020 2:20 PM] Sebastien#0653
Yeah, I'm referring to the min box value.
Notably, the following case:

input 1200 nanoErg
output: 360 nanoErg
fee: 700 nanoErg

there is 140 leftover (1200 - 360 - 700 = 140)

Since there is ERG left, the wallet would want to add a change address, but it can't because the min box value is 360. Therefore the 140 nanoErg leftover has to be "burned" by adding it to the tx fee


[09/25/2020 2:23 PM] greenhat#6562
For this case there is `min_change_value` param. So for such change amount no box will be created, it will be left for miner's to collect. Note that 360 is per byte of the box size.


[09/25/2020 2:24 PM] greenhat#6562
But, yeah, we're badly lacking min box and tx fee estimation.


[09/25/2020 2:26 PM] Sebastien#0653
Is it possible that we use sigma-rust for Yoroi for just creating regular transactions? I know some other stuff isn't done yet, but maybe there is enough for this?


[09/25/2020 2:33 PM] greenhat#6562
@Sebastien if by regular you mean P2PK address (pay to public key) then yes, tx building and signing was recently implemented. It's might be raw but it should work and I'll do my best to fix it ASAP on your feedback.


[09/25/2020 2:35 PM] greenhat#6562
I'm adding box builder now in https://github.com/ergoplatform/sigma-rust/pull/93 and I want to have min box value estimation there as well.

[09/25/2020 2:47 PM] Robert K#0722
It would be great if we could already start off with using sigma-rust now for Yoroi as it would simplify future development as we add smartcontract support.

@greenhat So with P2PK support, does that mean only P2PK *inputs* are allowed to be used, but we can still send to P2S addresses? Or does it mean only P2PK outputs as well?

@Robert K P2PK-only requirements are for inputs only since only inputs are involved in tx signing. So, yes, in outputs can be anything you want.

Great, makes sense. Just wanted to verify to be 100% sure.

@Sebastien is master key used in Yoroi ?


[09/25/2020 4:13 PM] Sebastien#0653
@kushti yes, we store the encrypted master key for signing


[09/25/2020 4:14 PM] kushti#0978
@Sebastien in case of wallet import, will funds sent previously to the master key recognized ?


[09/25/2020 4:15 PM] Sebastien#0653
no, we don't generate any address from the master key, only from the address keys


[09/25/2020 4:15 PM] Sebastien#0653
we could spend time creating an "upgrade" prompt if we detect funds on the master key address though

I've had some Ergo sent to my Coinbarn wallet. It shows in the transactions and they all have over 100 confirmations.

The Total Balance remains at 0 though and I can't spend the coins in there?

Anyone else had these issues?


[02/16/2021 7:05 PM] Teknishun#4659
PS. The Coinbarn wallet address is 80 characters long but other addresses I've seen it 51 characters. Is this the problem?
The address shows on the coin explorer with the transactions so it is valid.

[02/17/2021 6:12 AM] Jur1cek#3908
I have got the same problem (ticked miner address in coinbarn). Unfortunatelly importing to ergowallet (and waiting for full sync) did not help.


[02/17/2021 8:00 AM] Teknishun#4659
I've realised the difference was worth the Miner address checkbox. This produces a 80 character address. Not ticking it makes a regular 51 character address. I'm not quite sure of the difference.

@Jur1cek did you manage to export the private key from Coinbarn or did you just use the mnemonic phrase?


[02/17/2021 8:01 AM] Jur1cek#3908
@Teknishun I used phrase

Q&A on mining (for pool operators and solo miners)
This Q&A is for pool operators and solo miners mostly.  Why are mining rewards going to some strange addresses?   Mining rewards are going to UTXOs associated with special scripts which are locking rewards to miner public keys for 720 blocks (72 in the testnet). Examples of such scripts are mPdcmQkPPvyJZtvwyc2ZFboEue1X1uMw729UbUhe5ZoQJAQsWyKmLck...

Reposting here.  Anyone interested in helping me test an iPhone (works on iPad too) light-wallet app I've built?  Prerequisites: 
 The app assumes you have a full reference node running somewhere on your network. 
 The app merely communicates via http to your locally (on your LAN) running ERGO node to keep it light.  It allows you to have multiple accounts and easily switch between them regardless of whether or not they are associated with the mainnet or the testnet.  I built it because 1)  I wanted to be mobile (works via VPN as well) and 2) got tired of cutting and pasting my authkey and password into the swagger UI on the reference node implementation and 3) I needed an excuse to learn SwiftUI.  To see a video of the app in action:  https://youtu.be/qZfHgSC0_Xg  To see the app when connected to a synchronizing Ergo node: https://youtu.be/bLOrqWY3wac.  DM me if interested.  You will need to download the TestFlight app from Apple (from the app store) to see the test builds as they evolve.

I ran the 4.0.2.jar full node on my mac book pro and initialize a wallet, kept the 15 word passpharse and withdrew some ergo coins from coinex to the wallet¬†


https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/addresses/9iEooMaaCeMDKHwwRkyxhG7v2vVFopMTNxXgXWxguTiPFPx158W


However I did not sync the node for a while I recently downloaded the 4.0.4 version and resynced the full node but its initializing a different wallet and I cannot access my ergo again,


CAN these be redeemed¬†or its gone forever?

hi, try to add this line to your config file:

Reading up and learning more about Ergo and SigUSD/RSV and am curious if any of the wallets accept SigUSD or RSV yet? Yoroi plays beautifully with the ERG.. what about the others? 
If I head over to the conversion (sigmausd io) site and start playing there with my current ERG wallet address, would I be able to put those tokens anywhere or where would they exist? 
(Apology if this is a topic in the wrong area, or covered recently - I clicked around search and websites to try to learn more but figured I'd ask. Thanks for your patience and education building this!)


[04/16/2021 4:18 AM] Dergler#0451
they will be in your ERG wallet in yoroi. these are native assets, similar to native assets on cardano.


[04/16/2021 8:59 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
12 words= byron era, now in the 15 word shelly era. download DAEDALUS on desktop only allow 3-4 hour blockchain sync, most likely able to  restore the byron era address with the 12 word seed.  Edit( should say create new shelly address to send wallet balance to. Keep new seed phrase secure. Will work for ADA, worth a shot for Erg...? Idk I'm almost certain You can figure this out.


[04/16/2021 2:01 PM] Dergler#0451
ERG is a different blockchain than ADA, and Daedalus doesn‚Äôt work with ERG at all.

Sorry for the incorrect information,& thank you for correction.  What would a a 12 word recovery phrase be in regards to ERG? There's gotta be a remidy right? That is assuming the phrase is correct.


[04/17/2021 1:18 AM] Dergler#0451
No worries! When you make an ERG wallet in Yoroi, you will generate a recover seed phrase.

Right, I understand that.  I'm still confused I guess.  I wanted to help the person who's having trouble restoring using the 12 word seed from Magnum wallet.  Is a 12 word phrase for Erg outdated legacy address like on Cardano..?

Please don't mine directly to an exchange wallet.  Regarding your problem usually there's a threshold amount to reach for the pool to send your mined funds.


[04/27/2021 9:23 PM] ponte#8953
Oh sorry I misread, if the transaction from the pool is sent than you better check with hotbit

Yes, I recognize herominers which I also mine with, and the default payment threshold is 1 erg, so when that"pending balance" reach 1 or more the pool will send you the amount


[04/27/2021 10:07 PM] soninho89#8594
I now understand... Not even if you want to approach the limit for exchange, sorry my ignorance


[04/27/2021 10:10 PM] ponte#8953
The problem with exchange is that a large amount of small transaction gives or may give issue to the exchanges

Better to send it to node wallet or yoroi wallet

[05/20/2021 5:50 PM] bbot#6878
With hardware wallets like Ledger, they recommend not receiving many mining payments for coins like BTC as it can take a while if you want to send the funds.
I know this doesn't pertain to ETH. Will this also affect ERG? Is it okay to make weekly ERG transfers to my Ledger when Ledger is integrated with ERG?


[05/20/2021 11:32 PM] calvinsbrew#0141
The guide to make a wallet is yes, a full node. If you want a simpler way to make a wallet and don't mind light-clients, check out Yoroi


[05/26/2021 12:43 PM] Spicemustflow#1078
hello, I tried to launch the ergo wallet and it was perferct but I've sent some ergo to my wallet address and I can only see the amount I've sent only if I click on my address link, along with the number of confirmations. Could you elaborate on how does this work, do I need a number of confirmations in order to see my ergo in my balance. I know I'm a noob but I tried and I believe in the idea of utxo projects, besides that I was fascinated by the way the Ergo wallet works so I didn't put my assets to my yoroi wallet. I'm willing to invest more on this but I just can't figure this out


[05/26/2021 1:32 PM] andee#4722
@bbot to my knowledge ERG will also be affected by this on hardware wallets. From what I have gathered you can send a transaction with the wallets full amount to yourself once in a while and it will consolidate the tx's

So how does one go about making an address?  I tried installing the wallet from the main site... but I don't see any place to just create a new address.  Do I have to wait until the wallet is synchronized with the chain?

[06/03/2021 5:58 PM] Kaven#6681
I still have an issue where I have restored a wallet from mnemonic and lost access to a derived key. I have the address, i just dont have the derivation path. I tried using ergo util PathMatcher, but it ran for a few days with no success. I was able to use the PathMatcher on another address and it worked quickly. any thoughts here?


[06/03/2021 6:01 PM] Kaven#6681
the derived key was generated using /wallet/deriveNextKey on node v4.0.x


[06/03/2021 7:53 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
question for me to understand: for what do you derive keys? what is the benefit over using another mnemonic?


[06/03/2021 8:11 PM] Kaven#6681
i derived keys so i could transact in public


[06/03/2021 8:11 PM] Kaven#6681
it is useful to compartmentalize assets/tokens so you're not flashing around your bank account every time you want to do a simple tx


[06/03/2021 8:32 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
you mean so not everyone can see your balance?


[06/03/2021 8:32 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I get that, but you could achieve that by setting up a completely new wallet as well?


[06/04/2021 1:45 AM] Bradman117#7278
Just a thought, but I think it would be nice if there was a note section in the ergo wallet.


[06/04/2021 4:10 AM] Redman#2839
Can I import a Yoroi wallet seed into the full node?


[06/04/2021 4:17 AM] Redman#2839
Nevermind, I was able to restore my wallet by adding another one in yoroi after forgetting the spend password.


[06/04/2021 8:10 AM] andee#4722
yes, but you need to derive extra addresses manually


[06/04/2021 8:42 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
that means: first generated address is the same? how to know the derivation pass of extra addresses?


[06/04/2021 11:08 AM] andee#4722
I haven't tried restoring yoroi on the node myself, but a couple people said they just used `/wallet/deriveNextKey` @MrStahlfelge


[06/04/2021 12:44 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
so probably that's what they use under the hoods? but how is the next key after the next key derieved?


[06/04/2021 12:52 PM] andee#4722
I think it just increments the last number in the derivation path by 1


[06/04/2021 1:34 PM] Madgick#1207
hey all, I heard Ledger support is in the works. I'm about to checkout 3x Ledger Nano S

both are mentioned here, I'm just gonna assume that means both will be supported, before these go out of stock again üòÑ

@Kaven did you find out if they are supported yet? I‚Äôve had mine sitting in yoroi wallet but would like to transfer to cold storage as well


[06/06/2021 11:27 PM] Kaven#6681
do you mean if you're able to recover access to derived keys? i am not sure yet. i created 1 mnemonic, then 1  additional public key using /wallet/deriveNextKey. then i received tokens at the new address. then i lost access to the entire node and reinstalled it. then i recreated access to the wallet using the mnemonic and that was fine, but i still cannot recover access to the key i derived. i think when you derive a key, and use that key to hold tokens, you need to save the derivation path. supposedly you can use ergo-util which contains a function called PathMatcher to recover it, but it has not worked for me.

Hi all, I am using the Yoroi wallet and it's browser based. When I logged back in, I had to restore my wallet. Now once restored I have a new wallet address and I can't get my old one back, anyone know what to do?

@HaychAU did you have multiple addresses?


[06/09/2021 12:28 AM] andee#4722
I would check your wallets though, you do not have to restore from seed unless you delete your wallet


[06/09/2021 12:39 AM] HaychAU#7544
Yeah I never deleted it


[06/09/2021 12:40 AM] HaychAU#7544
I don't have multiple addresses

I only created the wallet yesterday and had been mining


[06/09/2021 12:40 AM] HaychAU#7544
when I got back on today it didn't have it and I had to restore it


[06/09/2021 1:58 AM] HaychAU#7544
So even though I restored the wallet, I have a new address now? Why is that?


[06/09/2021 1:58 AM] HaychAU#7544

[06/09/2021 2:40 AM] intuit#0229
New address should be fine.. there can multiple addresses for one wallet


[06/09/2021 2:56 AM] HaychAU#7544
How do I retrieve my old address?


[06/09/2021 2:56 AM] HaychAU#7544
It's not in the list anymore


[06/09/2021 4:50 AM] HaychAU#7544
Oh I get you now!!!


[06/09/2021 4:59 AM] HaychAU#7544
So all the mining I have done will still go into that wallet even though the address isn't in there anymore?


[06/09/2021 6:54 AM] Gazza_SP#5835
Ya, every wallet has used and unused addresses, on the receive page, if you scroll down you can find a list of used and unused addresses, not sure if the old address will be there after a seed restore but it will still show in your main wallet balance. A way to test if you wanted is to send a small amount to coinex and back.


[06/09/2021 8:45 AM] HaychAU#7544
Awesome. Thanks heaps. I'll change the address once I get a payment into the account. Should happen tomorrow. Thanks.

hey, guys,  i wonder if it is possible to import seed from coinbarn to yoroi, or official node? in coinbarn i have 88at the beginning and while importing im getting wrong wallet address with 9s in the beginning with no coins


[06/09/2021 10:11 PM] andee#4722
look around for the derivation path coinbarn used


[06/09/2021 10:12 PM] andee#4722
or just transfer from coinbarn to the default yoroi addr


[06/09/2021 10:46 PM] pole#7152
i dont get it. is it impossible to restore from coinbarn 12 word pass phrase into yoroi or am i doing something wrong? yoroi is making new wallet if i enter my 12wordsüò∂  i have multiple wallets and creating another bunch to send funds is not i really want to doüòÖ


[06/09/2021 10:59 PM] andee#4722
send from coinbarn to the yoroi wallet which you restored with your initial seed?


[06/09/2021 11:00 PM] andee#4722
you have access to it, but you need the derivation path coinbarn used to recreate it


[06/09/2021 11:00 PM] andee#4722
so its just easier to send from coinbarn to the yoroi wallet


[06/09/2021 11:14 PM] pole#7152
so if coinbarn or yoroi scams = funds lost? cause you cant import seed from any wallet to others. even official one.and official one is pain in the butt to set up.
its not easier to send if you have 10 wallets and you need to create 10 more just to make sure funds are safu


[06/09/2021 11:16 PM] andee#4722
you can import the seed, but the derivation path coinbarn uses seems to be a strange one as addresses starting with 88 is mining reward address I think


[06/09/2021 11:16 PM] andee#4722
do you have access to your coinbarn wallet?


[06/09/2021 11:16 PM] pole#7152
ye i do, and it was created as mining address


[06/09/2021 11:16 PM] andee#4722
yoroi is not a scam wallet, your funds are safe


[06/09/2021 11:17 PM] andee#4722
so if you want to use yoroi, is it a big problem to just send the funds from your coinbarn wallet to yoroi?


[06/09/2021 11:18 PM] andee#4722
the same private key is derived from your seed, yoroi probably uses another derivation path for public key creation so the keys coinbarn made does not show in yoroi


[06/09/2021 11:21 PM] andee#4722
the node wallet supports deriving keys with custom paths, so importing a coinbarn wallet probably needs to be done to the node wallet and key must be derived from the same path that coinbarn uses


[06/09/2021 11:26 PM] morbes#6686
Any idea why my Yoroi wallet is saying time difference error to the server? My clock has been synced to latest time and time zone. It won't go away even after restarting. I'm running Firefox.


[06/09/2021 11:33 PM] andee#4722
just checked coinbarns source, it uses the same derivation path as yoroi


[06/09/2021 11:33 PM] andee#4722
So I don't get why you have an address starting with 88


[06/09/2021 11:34 PM] pole#7152
cause ive checked "mining address" when creating

[06/09/2021 11:39 PM] andee#4722

neither yoroi nor official node accepting my seed, but ive imported it on my old pc and its 100% correct


[06/09/2021 11:55 PM] andee#4722
you choose import, input name, password, accept, go to next page, then you input your seed


[06/09/2021 11:56 PM] andee#4722
yoroi will import the seed from coinbarn as long as its correct

and 0 ballance, but seed is 100% correct.
and its saying "new wallet created" when i finish import


[06/10/2021 12:00 AM] andee#4722
well of course its a new wallet. you just created it


[06/10/2021 12:01 AM] pole#7152
it wouldnt even let me press restore if my phrase is incorrect


[06/10/2021 12:02 AM] andee#4722
no, because if its not correct the checksum is wrong most of the time


[06/10/2021 12:02 AM] andee#4722
you can be "lucky" and input a wrong combination with a valid checksum but that's how its supposed to work


[06/10/2021 12:08 AM] pole#7152
never had an issue while importing keys for other coins,  this is a shame. thats what you get when youre forced to use weird 3rd party app with no official alternative


[06/10/2021 12:10 AM] andee#4722
the node is official, and is pretty easy to setup compared to many others


[06/10/2021 12:10 AM] andee#4722
if your seed is correct it will work


[06/10/2021 12:10 AM] pole#7152

[06/10/2021 12:12 AM] andee#4722
no it is not. everything is relative I suppose


[06/10/2021 12:12 AM] andee#4722
it could be streamlined a little more of course, but it takes no more than a couple of minutes


[06/10/2021 12:12 AM] andee#4722
syncing takes longer of course, but so does all chains that are more than a few hundred MB


[06/10/2021 12:13 AM] andee#4722
but either way, BIP32/BIP39 is standards and if the seed is correct it works.


[06/10/2021 12:17 AM] pole#7152
you need to have more than average knowledge of crypto to just create wallet, and to spend few hours. this is unacceptable for most users, not everyone are developers here, and willing to spend their time exploring depths of crypto standarts üòÜ


[06/10/2021 12:19 AM] andee#4722
seems like 99% of people are able to create their wallets and write down the correct seed within minutes

i wish i could, but i cant import my seed, thats where we started


[06/10/2021 12:30 AM] andee#4722
I tested coinbarn, importing a wallet works perfectly fine. So I would double check the seed


[06/10/2021 12:31 AM] pole#7152
its okay if you are creating wallet with 9, but if you check "mining address" its making 8 and its not importing to yoroi


[06/10/2021 12:32 AM] andee#4722
so then I ask again, why not import to coinbarn and send it to the yoroi wallet?


[06/10/2021 12:34 AM] andee#4722
normal addresses start with 9, you don't need a special address for pool rewards


[06/10/2021 12:35 AM] pole#7152
ive already have keys for that and wanna move funds to cold storage

are you able to restore coinbarn with this seed? `second blush neutral always cool forum slim doll vessel metal recycle bracket`

There is a headers collection phase and then blocks collection phase. So if you stop the node and then restart after some time, then the new headers need to be collected first and then blocks collection will continue.

use `/wallet/deriveNextKey` to derive the extra keys

You can also always use Yoroi instead of ergo wallet full node üòâ

Enjoy! Well that's where I got this problem in the yoroi wallet. Cause it's Web based Firefox cleared cache and when I reloaded I had to restore my wallet using the memoic and when it was restored my old address wasn't there.

When I run the rescan, I get
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:9053/wallet/rescan" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "api_key: *******"
The server was not able to produce a timely response to your request.

Please try again in a short while!

@HaychAU that is from the one you were certain you did not use. You need to use deriveNextKey

Yup I have now 9 addresses. However I don‚Äôt have my original address

If you kept using deriveKey the keys will be wrong. paste a response from deriveNextKey @HaychAU

on yoroi you also have to generate the extra addresses after restoring

that's how several others have recovered their addresses. you said you were 100% sure that you used deriveNextKey but the output you pasted was from deriveKey which will not derive same addresses you had in yoroi unless you change the path manually

did you check the explorer for your address to see what's going on? 

Also which wallet are you using?  I think you're using that wallet out there that most of us wouldn't trust.  There's only 2 wallets, and its these 2: https://ergoplatform.org/en/wallets/

Can somebody quickly explain to me how to use multisignature for the ergo wallet?


[06/30/2021 6:04 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
For using a full node wallet, what is a reasonable server location?  Home systems can go offline for a bit, is that ok?  Or, something like aws ec2 make sense (any size recommendations if someone is doing this?) Thanks!


[06/30/2021 6:12 PM] Nythain#6769
If youre just running the node for wallet and because you can, then a home system is fine. Even if it goes offline briefly, shouldnt take long to sync back up.


[06/30/2021 7:06 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
It took a few hours to fully sync, this is no problem? ...or on vacation and power goes out or something silly, ok to sync back up and recover transactions?

Yeah

hey, can someone explain to me what is the purpose of wallet Initialization if you are just hosting node?


[07/01/2021 11:33 PM] andee#4722
you only need the wallet if you are solo mining with the node or use it as a wallet


[07/01/2021 11:40 PM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
Understood and thank You. Sso are you required to go through all the steps around wallet if you are not intend to solo mine or use the wallet? Are there any additional steps if you would want to use that node with other miners do you know?


[07/01/2021 11:41 PM] andee#4722
@en4ble | bmoblockchain.us there is not really many steps to make the wallet though, you set a password and you get a seed. its not needed for anything else than mining or actually sending receiving erg


[07/01/2021 11:42 PM] andee#4722
using it for a pool requires making a wallet, that's where the block rewards will go


[07/02/2021 12:51 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
Thank you again for reply. Is there any knowledge base that talks about running a node for public presence? Looking for information such as compute requirements, install etc...


[07/02/2021 12:52 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
"using it for a pool requires making a wallet, that's where the block rewards will go" - how is that redistributed if you have multiple addresses mining? Again looking for some references/kb.


[07/02/2021 12:57 AM] andee#4722
a database with valid shares, and a payment system that pays based on what reward system is used


[07/02/2021 12:57 AM] andee#4722
there is no ready made solution for this, you would have to modify an existing pool system or write your own. there is a stratum server to connect to the node


[07/02/2021 12:58 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
is that build in or outside ergo scope?


[07/02/2021 12:58 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
so custom?


[07/02/2021 12:59 AM] andee#4722
ergo was originally without any pools by design, but when people found a way around it using smart contracts the decision was made to allow pool mining for all but there is no software developed by ergo foundation for setting up a pool


[07/02/2021 1:05 AM] en4ble | bmoblockchain.us#4368
that is unfortunate, especially if you want to grow Ergo ecosystem. There are 4 pools available but of course you won't get answers there.  I appreciate your time.


[07/02/2021 1:31 AM] andee#4722
@en4ble | bmoblockchain.us but the 4 that exists are capable pool operators. having a finished solution could attract both scammers and people that are not capable of operating a pool. I am sure there will be more pools to choose from as time passes by. I don't think pool mining has even existed for 6 months yet

[07/02/2021 4:08 AM] 1ceRaven#8859
@aligoodn yes, as andee said, i simply rebooted, stopped the  node , restarted it and it worked. I sent 2 erg i think that time. It was not a crazy amount. I got caught up a lot these days. I'll try and search the log during the week-end and post it here.

@aligoodn did you resolve your problem ?


[07/03/2021 5:00 PM] aligoodn#3507
Yes smaller transactions work perfectly fine.  ERG transaction fees aren't bad at all, so its easy to just do a bunch of 250 ERG transactions to move it around


[07/03/2021 5:12 PM] andee#4722
sounds like you got a phat stack

@BuzzLiteBeer @TooDegenToQuit I've got an iOS lite client written in SwiftUI that is up in TestFlight.  It is a thin client that requires you have a running node somewhere on your lan and it uses the web api endpoints from that node to work with it.  Shoot me your emails and I'll add you to the test group.  You should then get an email from apple to download the TestFlight testing app to get going.


[07/30/2021 2:28 PM] tech#7970
What does the Android app use that it doesn't need a local node running?

GraalVM is an option, not a requirement. Appkit can be used (as a jar library) on any environment that can run Java 7/Java 8 apps. 
Android can do this. 
Also there are tools which allow to translate Java into native executable (like native-image from Graal, Gluon Mobile https://gluonhq.com/products/mobile/ or RoboVM)

[07/30/2021 3:41 PM] tech#7970
I'm not sure why Appkit has this in it's README.md

"By its very nature, Ergo applications are both decentralized and cross-platform ranging from web applications running in browsers, mobile applications running on Android and iOS, standalone applications executing on Linux, MacOS or Windows to services deployed in cloud servers."


[07/30/2021 3:42 PM] morphic#4133
That was motivation for creating Appkit in a way it can be used not only from JVM


[07/30/2021 3:43 PM] tech#7970
Appkit is just a wrapper then for "ErgoScript interpreter and Ergo protocol" then?


[07/30/2021 3:43 PM] morphic#4133
exactly


[07/30/2021 3:43 PM] tech#7970
Java was used to make it multi-platform? Any reason not using C?


[07/30/2021 3:48 PM] morphic#4133
Java is multiplatform, as long as you can run it on at least more than two platforms. People run Java on Desktop, Anrdoid, iOS.


[07/30/2021 3:48 PM] morphic#4133
Not sure what mean "not using C", what is your idea about using C?


[07/30/2021 3:51 PM] tech#7970
Just thought it might be "easier", using C for building the library and making it cross platform. I've deployed Java in every OS I could think of for work and hobby projects, just never iOS.


[07/30/2021 4:04 PM] morphic#4133
yeah, unfortunately it is not possible to build Java library using C. There are other tools that can do it however, I wrote about them above.

question anyone know anything about coinbarn wallet? trying to import my wallet from there to the new ergo wallet app but its asking for 15 word phrase the back up from coin barn is only 12


[07/31/2021 9:21 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
the next app update will let you restore 12 word mnemonics. I don't know the derivation path coinbarn used though - can you restore the wallet with yoroi? if yes, then it is okay and you will be fine


[07/31/2021 10:38 PM] Marcx987#5773
15/24 word or read only in yoroi. will be making a new wallet once the ledget app for ergo is ready. if cant import other than read only just means i have to physically go to the one pc to move funds around.

Think it's just one wallet, you can generate new addresses though. You can also use the ErgoMixer to setup a covert address


[08/04/2021 10:20 AM] george79#6437
is there an instruction how to generate new address using the node?


[08/04/2021 10:41 AM] george79#6437
The question is which option to use in Swagger to generate and add another address to the node. Is it the firs one on the list, or the last one? I don't want to "lose" my existing wallet just by replacing it withe the new one by mistake üòâ

I'm using Ergo Wallet by Benjamin Schulte. When I tried to send ERG funds I receive error:

"Not enough funds in boxes to pay 44001000000 nanoERGs, 
tokens: [], 
reason: NotEnoughErgsError(not enough boxes to meet ERG needs 44001000000 (found only 24503670954))"


[08/09/2021 3:50 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
some people reported this problem. I suspect you have many small boxes that can't get collected at once so sending in two chunks helps, but some users said just retrying helped for them.


[08/09/2021 3:59 PM] Mikke#8697
Ok, I try send ERG funds two or three chunks. Thanks for your answers üòä

Javascript console shows an error. I could imagine that is the same problem the wallet had sending your ergs, because it internally uses the explorer api

I just used restore wallet and mispelled one of the words of my mnemonic words and it still restored a wallet. Does that mean that a new wallet is created when you do that?

hey guys, how does one re-initialise their wallet via the web panel (node interface) ? I know the documentation says to use wallet /restore api endpoint but how exactly is that done (sorry noob here)
(I'm trying to restore a wallet but accidentally created a new one vs reentering the old seed and restoring it- trying now to get back to the initialization on first use screen)


[08/12/2021 2:37 PM] DenAce#1197
Stop node running.
Delete wallet folder in the ergo folder you're running your node in.
Run node again and visit the panel.
Then you can reenter the seed phrase.


[08/12/2021 2:38 PM] DenAce#1197
Make sure you have your mnemonic key


[08/12/2021 2:41 PM] DenAce#1197
I made an extra folder in which I saved all my created wallets (wallet folders) so I can switch between them quickly. Then you don't have to use restore function everytime you switch between folders.

[08/13/2021 9:59 AM] DenAce#1197
Hey, I have a problem with one adress of my Ergo node wallets:
I used derive key to get additional adresses (3 in total).
I sent different amounts to each adress
I then shut down the node and deleted the wallet folder on my desktop pc in the ergo folders where I run the node (because I had copied the folder before so i can switch between different wallets faster).
I then copied the folder back into where the wallet was supposed to be.
I was only having access to 2 of the adresses.
I used derive key and got the missing adress back.
The adress didn't show the actual amount of my ERGs (should be 301.245 ERGs) on that adress but instead shows 0 on node panel.
In Ergo Explorer it is showing the correct amount.
When restored in Yoroi that adress was missing again.
When generating a new adress in Yoroi the adress was totally new and is not shown in Ergo node panel adress overview.
When sending all assets from Yoroi to another adress, the 301.245 ERGs were not send with it.
When looking into Ergo Explorer the correct balance on that adress is still shown.
How do I fix this?

@DenAce did you use deriveKey or deriveNextKey?


[08/13/2021 10:31 AM] DenAce#1197
I think it was derive key


[08/13/2021 10:32 AM] andee#4722
then you probably have to restore it with the node wallet and transfer to main address


[08/13/2021 10:32 AM] andee#4722
unless you change the derivation path on deriveKey it will use a non standard path


[08/13/2021 10:33 AM] DenAce#1197
I tried restoring once already and it only gave me one adress out of the 3 that were there originally


[08/13/2021 10:35 AM] andee#4722
did you try deriving them again?


[08/13/2021 10:35 AM] DenAce#1197
then i copied one of the wallet folders back into the ergo folder I'm running the node in and I had 2 of my original adresses. then I used derive key and got my 3rd adress plus one extra (although when using that function it always creates 2 adresses with the same numbers/letters and later changes one of the two to another adress)


[08/13/2021 10:40 AM] andee#4722
if you run deriveKey two times without changing the path it derives the same key


[08/13/2021 10:41 AM] andee#4722
use deriveNextKey when creating extra addresses


[08/13/2021 10:43 AM] andee#4722
https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/blob/master/eip-0003.md


[08/13/2021 10:44 AM] DenAce#1197
used it once, but without changing anything in the example so i guess it runs it twice when using that?


[08/13/2021 10:45 AM] andee#4722
it only creates one address for me so not sure about that one


[08/13/2021 10:48 AM] andee#4722

It did the same with derive next key. 2 adresses were added when I used it. Not much of a problem rn but still weird that this keeps happening.


[08/13/2021 3:12 PM] andee#4722
weird, does the key index in the response increment by 2 every time you do it too?


[08/13/2021 3:14 PM] DenAce#1197
This is the standard info I see.
It showed me only one adress as a response but that adress was added twice. Later one of the duplicates turns into a new adress then.

[08/13/2021 3:16 PM] andee#4722
that's just the example response though, and its from derivekey. when you use deriveNextKey it will respond with the path used for the key


[08/13/2021 3:17 PM] andee#4722
ah, I see the example is the same on them both


[08/13/2021 3:18 PM] andee#4722
```{
  "derivationPath": "m/44'/429'/0'/0/2",
  "address": "3Wwau335XRcWGAh6HyqqChDNYSVu67gMHZksUzoQCqQzzDYVQM5b"
}```


[08/13/2021 3:18 PM] andee#4722
this is a normal response from deriveNextKey


[08/13/2021 3:18 PM] andee#4722
and the last number in the path should be incremented by 1 for each time you derive a key


[08/13/2021 3:22 PM] andee#4722
I get no duplicates or addresses being replaced when using it though


[08/13/2021 3:25 PM] DenAce#1197
derivationPath": "m/44'/429'/0'/0/3
but this is the 4th adress that was added (so 5 in total with one being a duplicate)


[08/13/2021 3:32 PM] andee#4722
if you used deriveKey for the other address it wont be counted in the key index of deriveNextKey


[08/13/2021 3:33 PM] andee#4722
key 0 is the one you start with, so you have added 3 addresses  with deriveNextKey


[08/13/2021 3:34 PM] andee#4722
+ 1 with deriveKey


[08/13/2021 4:57 PM] DenAce#1197
I only used deriveNextKey ^^


[08/13/2021 4:59 PM] DenAce#1197
Which I could check when generating a new adress in Yoroi as the function used there seems to be deriveNextKey


[08/13/2021 5:06 PM] andee#4722
I think yoroi adds adresses that was created with deriveNextKey automatically if they have been used


[08/13/2021 5:07 PM] DenAce#1197
Not always. Never mind. Have not used each adress I created


[08/13/2021 5:07 PM] andee#4722
you said you maybe used deriveKey earlier, so I just assumed you did if yoroi was unable to add a matching key


[08/13/2021 5:08 PM] DenAce#1197
When I had the problem with my missing adress balance, yes.
But I just used that function to test things with another wallet ;).

Noob question.. I've setup a node on 2 computers, Home and work. I messed around all day on the node at work, minted tokens and all. I get home, and imported my wallet using same mnemonic phrase. Wallet&Node are synced but no ergs nor tokens. When I look up my address on the explorer, I see all the transactions that I made today... but the unspent eutxos is not the exact address.. . Should I import the keystore files? I see mentions of derive key above in the feed, I don't really know what this means by I guess this is my problem right?


[08/14/2021 7:46 AM] andee#4722
did you only use the default address on your other node? deriveNextKey is for adding extra addresses

did you check your adresses in the explorer? you can see if it has worked at all if the transactions are documented there


[08/14/2021 8:42 PM] uyuck#1185
i am running ergo full node for my ergo wallet, my balance in my wallet shows 14.8, my miner shows 72.6 mined, when i click on my address it opens ergo explorer and shows the correct balance, why is there only 14.8 in my wallet, wallet and node both show synced. is there some setting i need to change?


[08/14/2021 8:43 PM] glasgowm#9381
Does the height match the explorer ?


[08/14/2021 8:55 PM] uyuck#1185
i dont know how to check that, on my node it shows current height 540135


[08/14/2021 10:12 PM] glasgowm#9381
Compare to https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/


[08/15/2021 12:05 AM] uyuck#1185
no they are not the same


[08/15/2021 1:08 AM] uyuck#1185
how do i get my node to catch up its still at 540135 the explorer is at 554617


[08/15/2021 1:39 PM] HaychAU#7544
You need to let the node sync. Once you‚Äôve launched it should start syncing


[08/15/2021 3:10 PM] uyuck#1185
@HaychAU thanks @andee  helped me last night had to delete history and state folders and restart node to resync took a few hours but it found all my ergo

Greetings , 
I have recently started mining ergo and using the Desktop Node Wallet ..
I am encountering an issue where the specific ergo wallet address shows that it has received 4 transactions of 1 ergo each , but my wallet balance reads 0..
Has anyone else had this?
Thank you in advance and I am sorry if this has been answered somewhere else.. If that is the case , some direction to that material would be much appreciated .


[08/16/2021 10:21 AM] user#4413
Also, I tried installing the android wallet app and using the seed phrase i had gotten when creating the node wallet to restore it on my phone , but when i did , i received a different wallet address...
Im having a hard time figuring out what im doing wrong : (


[08/16/2021 10:25 AM] user#4413
I now see that @uyuck sort of had the same problem , so i deleted the db and will wait to see what happens


[08/16/2021 10:25 AM] user#4413
but what about the Android app giving me a different wallet address?


[08/16/2021 10:43 AM] andee#4722
are you certain that you input the seed correctly?


[08/16/2021 11:23 AM] user#4413
yes , word for word , triple checked


[08/16/2021 11:28 AM] andee#4722
@MrStahlfelge


[08/16/2021 11:32 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I was told node derives eip3 addresses like yoroi does - isn't it like that? Android app derives from the eip3 path


[08/16/2021 11:32 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
So it is the same as yoroi for sure, node seems to be different sometimes


[08/16/2021 11:37 AM] user#4413
silly question but when im inputing the seed phrase (in the android app) i get a message saying that my Public wallet Address is : XXXX , so the public wallet address is supposed to be different from the ergo address generated in the ergo platform node wallet page?

[08/16/2021 11:42 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
As written above, I would have thought Ergo node generates eip3 addresses. That's a standard behavior and yoroi does it this way, so I did the same on the app


[08/16/2021 11:42 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Maybe node can derive different types?


[08/16/2021 11:43 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Btw, ist your App version 1.0 or 1.1?


[08/16/2021 11:44 AM] user#4413
1.1.2111


[08/16/2021 11:57 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Good. 1.1 warns you in case of typos in seed phrase


[08/16/2021 11:58 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
did you use yoroi, too? if you try it, you'll see it generates the same address as Android app


[08/16/2021 11:59 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I asked in #node what derivation path node uses


[08/16/2021 12:02 PM] andee#4722
when using deriveNextKey it returns 44'/429'/0/0/x


[08/16/2021 12:02 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
and by default a different one?


[08/16/2021 12:03 PM] andee#4722
I assume that is the path that is used, when deriving the first additional key the key index is 1


[08/16/2021 12:05 PM] andee#4722
```    * Post - EIP3 derivation path
    */
  val eip3DerivationPath: DerivationPath = DerivationPath.fromEncoded("m/44'/429'/0'/0/0").get```


[08/16/2021 12:06 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
then it should be the same and I have no explanation why addresses are different. a check using yoroi would be interesting @user


[08/16/2021 12:10 PM] andee#4722
unless usePreEip3Derivation = true it should generate using eip-3


[08/16/2021 12:36 PM] user#4413
tried using the seed phrase on Yoroi and i got the same address that the android app is giving me

[08/16/2021 12:36 PM] user#4413
but why does the ergo address generated in the ergo platform show nowhere else xD

btw thank you all for trying to help me with this , appreciate it ..


[08/16/2021 12:57 PM] andee#4722
@user what does your node config look like? do you have `usePreEip3Derivation` in there?


[08/16/2021 1:09 PM] user#4413
ergo {
  node {
    mining = true
  }
}
scorex {
 restApi {
    # Hex-encoded Blake2b256 hash of an API key. 
    # Should be 64-chars long Base16 string.
    # below is the hash of the string 'x'
    # replace with your actual hash 
    apiKeyHash =x
  }
}


[08/16/2021 1:09 PM] user#4413
thats all thats in there


[08/16/2021 2:43 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I had another user complaining about the problem on Play Store reviews, maybe it is neede to explicitely set usePreEip3Derivation to false?


[08/16/2021 4:51 PM] user#4413
@MrStahlfelge so how would i go about doing that?
just add in there #usePreEip3Derivation = false ?


[08/16/2021 4:52 PM] user#4413
and also what would this accomplish in my case?
i see the same ergo address on the node page as in the android app for example?


[08/16/2021 5:15 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
could be! I don't know the node


[08/16/2021 8:46 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Whats the difference between total recieved and final balance?


[08/16/2021 8:47 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
I dont have the same final balance as whats in my wallet. So this is a bit confusing to me


[08/16/2021 8:48 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
total received is everything you got but maybe spent


[08/16/2021 8:49 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
What about final balance? Why is this number lower than my current balance? Could be the balance after my last transfer?


[08/16/2021 9:55 PM] shinaolord#6633
For wallets, what should the addresses generally begin with? I have the node, and it's generating them all starting with 3, but several mining pools refuse to let me mine to them saying "invalid address". Can anyone explain what's going on?


[08/16/2021 9:58 PM] andee#4722
@shinaolord testnet addresses start with 3


[08/16/2021 9:58 PM] shinaolord#6633
wtf i have --mainnet on the command line REEE


[08/16/2021 9:58 PM] shinaolord#6633
thanks though that gives me a lead to figure this out


[08/16/2021 9:58 PM] shinaolord#6633
java -jar ergo-4.0.13.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf should put me on mainnet correct?


[08/16/2021 9:59 PM] andee#4722
have you run a testnet node from the same folder so you testnet wallet remaining?


[08/16/2021 9:59 PM] shinaolord#6633
I had an old wallet from testnet, but I generated a new one. Should I just re-make a node from scratch?


[08/16/2021 10:00 PM] shinaolord#6633
Thought i had deleted that wallet lol


[08/16/2021 10:00 PM] andee#4722
stop node, delete `.ergo/wallet`, start node again. initialize wallet


[08/16/2021 10:00 PM] shinaolord#6633
Was just doing that. Thank you, i'll lyk if it works. if it doesn't ill go cry in the corner ;D


[08/16/2021 10:02 PM] shinaolord#6633
still starts with 3 >.<. I think i'll just delete everything and start from scratch


[08/16/2021 10:07 PM] shinaolord#6633
Total reinstall fixed the issue.


[08/16/2021 10:08 PM] shinaolord#6633

What is the final balance on transaction page?


[08/17/2021 1:10 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
And why is this different from my api wallet balance?


[08/17/2021 1:11 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
It looks strange to me the desktop and mobile wallet both have different amounts. The mobile wallet displays my final balance but the desktop shows the actual balance


[08/17/2021 1:12 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
I sent .01 ergo to an exchange a while ago with .002 as a fee and it shows these values now


[08/17/2021 4:43 AM] CypherPet#3447
Sorry for the late reply. I used the default address on both straight from the mnemonic. But I think the second node got offset at some point . Friday, right after writing the question up there, I requested ergoDex test tokens with my new wallet. Received them. Derived my address with default values, nothing happened, re-scanned, lost my test tokens. When I got back at work, I had my test tokens plus everything I did last week. I simply swapped the wallet folder with the oldest one and now everything is fine. But I don't understand what went wrong with the addresses. Kinda scary


[08/17/2021 4:45 AM] CypherPet#3447
^ and yes, looking up my address in the Explorer showed all transactions I had made earlier. But they weren't accounted for on the node's wallet.


[08/17/2021 7:12 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Can you send the link of the page you are viewing?


[08/17/2021 8:49 AM] DenAce#1197
Try using rescan function on swagger. This will start a resync which cpuld solve your prob ;)


[08/17/2021 9:19 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
@MrStahlfelge I can send the amount from the desktop balance in full to another wallet. and it registers everywhere but the final balance and mobile wallet show the same amount but is almost always 1-2 ergo different from the desktop balance.


[08/17/2021 9:19 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
and which page? im looking at 3


[08/17/2021 9:20 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
start with one üôÇ


[08/17/2021 9:24 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
@MrStahlfelge I can do screenshots of all three if that helps?


[08/17/2021 9:25 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
a link to explorer would be better so I can look myself


[08/17/2021 9:28 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
ok sent


[08/17/2021 9:28 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yeah thanks. so final balance shows around 1 - where does it show more?


[08/17/2021 9:29 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
on my node balance sheet


[08/17/2021 9:29 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
so wallet information under node interface


[08/17/2021 9:29 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
check if you use any derived addresses


[08/17/2021 9:29 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
explorer and android wallet show you what is on the one address. node (probably) shows a sum of all addresses


[08/17/2021 9:30 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
that could be it


[08/17/2021 9:30 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
the node has .8 more ergo than on the android wallet


[08/17/2021 9:30 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
it was a much larger difference earlier


[08/17/2021 9:32 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
probably. the final balance there on explorer is the balance on that address. total received is the sum of all transactions that came in all-time, don't know what it is shown for


[08/17/2021 9:33 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
ok, so to fix this i will have to find the node address and apply it to the android settings under connections?


[08/17/2021 9:39 AM] andee#4722
@Blitzkrieg do you have more than one address on your node wallet?


[08/17/2021 9:40 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
I should only have the one address. i set up the android wallet with my mnemonic phrase after i was recieving ergo on the node wallet


[08/17/2021 2:45 PM] CypherPet#3447
I tried that,.. I requested wtada and wterg to see if that would trigger something. They appeared in my balance but not the other assets. I then rescanned after reading your other comment above but then my test ada and erg vanished. I fixed it by transferring the wallet folder from the first node to the new one. Then I had all my assets and my test tokens. Don't know what I did wrong.


[08/17/2021 3:50 PM] CypherPet#3447
Actually would "state=digest" cause this problem?

Hello everyone, I hope you are doing fine! I'm not sure if this is the right channel for this question, but here is it: 

I've been using waves.exchange wallet to keep my ERG bag. However, I was shocked to see that the "gateway fee" is 3 ERG. 
Does anyone know if there is any "technical" explanation for such a high fee?? Normally fees on the waves.exchange platform are quite low, so I was negatively surprised when seeing that 3 ERG fee!


[08/18/2021 3:46 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
not a technical reason, transaction fee on ergo platform is 0.001

Hi everyone, I'm a bit loss, I have created a wallet using Ergo Node Interface but whenever I load my seed it on Yoroi or Ergo Wallet (Android), it's a different address


[08/18/2021 8:11 PM] BigDog#8953
I had entered a mnemonic

tried to create a new wallet on the node but I don't see where to generate a new one


[08/18/2021 8:13 PM] BigDog#8953
or at least restore to see if my seed+mnemonic pwd is working


[08/18/2021 8:19 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
there are many people saying this the last days. what about sending your funds to the address yoroi and Android use?


[08/18/2021 8:20 PM] BigDog#8953
Hold on I'll try that and see if that works


[08/18/2021 8:24 PM] BigDog#8953
transferring from an exchange to node wallet will take some time


[08/18/2021 8:29 PM] andee#4722
does your node address start with 9 ?

yes


[08/18/2021 8:38 PM] BigDog#8953
if I want to reopen my wallet, do I simply have to close powershell and delete the wallet folder?

Just receive my ERG in the node wallet


[08/18/2021 8:40 PM] BigDog#8953
should I transfer them on my android wallet before re importing my wallet on the node? üòÖ


[08/18/2021 8:47 PM] BigDog#8953
both can receive payments


[08/18/2021 9:23 PM] BigDog#8953
and now that it's transferred I can't see my balance on my watch only android wallet (watching the node wallet)


[08/18/2021 9:24 PM] BigDog#8953
it says it's empty


[08/18/2021 9:24 PM] BigDog#8953
but when I look on the node interface it shows


[08/19/2021 2:30 PM] 0xOptable#7792
Could anyone give me a hand? I made a Ergo full node wallet and it as all synced.

I had to finish mining 1 ERG to get my first payout and I got it this morning. I transferred it to my wallet in the Ergo full node but I don't see it and the page just says "Active Synchronization." Any suggestions? I want to continue mining but I want it setup to go to my Ergo full node wallet. Also do I need to keep this wallet open 24/7? Can I use 1 address to receive all my mining funds?

Cheers.


[08/19/2021 2:32 PM] andee#4722
@BigDog you said the addresses didn't match, so that is to be expected if they don't. its very strange that the node mnemonic does not generate the same address on yoroi and the android wallet though


[08/19/2021 2:32 PM] andee#4722

if output on node says things like `Got x modifers` and `Apply modifier` you just need to wait it out

Okay does it to have to resync the whole thing every time it is shut down? I did a full sync yesterday. Cheers.


[08/19/2021 2:46 PM] andee#4722
it syncs from the latest block you had when shutting down the node. should be over fast as long as it was fully synced yesterday


[08/19/2021 2:50 PM] BigDog#8953
they do generate the same address on both yoroi and ergo android wallet. Just the node mnemonics that doesn't generate the same address. Guess it will be fixed in the future. I'll probably move my coins from the node when there is a client update


[08/19/2021 3:01 PM] andee#4722
node mnemonic not deriving the same address on the other wallets was what I meant


[08/19/2021 3:02 PM] BigDog#8953
yup, very strange, anyway I can still use it I've done xfer back and forth from those wallet


[08/20/2021 8:07 AM] Brad#3375
Hi all, new to this community.  Anyone have a recommended desktop wallet I should use?  Thanks.  Going to start mining this hopefully tomorrow

You can pick on from this page: https://ergoplatform.org/en/wallets/
Yoroi is a good choice.

[08/21/2021 5:04 AM] CRYPTK33P3R.#3684
I setup both wallets synced up the node and then the wallet mined but never showed up in my wallet and same for yoroi wallet. I'm pretty sure I setup the mining pool correctly for at least 1 of the pools I joined tried almost every one suggested in the site does it take awhile for the coins to start showing up in my wallet? Or do I need to mine a certain amount in order for it to start showing up?

I've followed the instructions to restore a wallet but it keeps creating a new address regardless


[08/21/2021 5:31 PM] andee#4722
when you created the first wallet, did you download the node from github?


[08/21/2021 5:46 PM] zennethx#3207
sooo I finally figured out what my issue was


[08/21/2021 5:47 PM] zennethx#3207
the mnemonic phrase I was using was for my first wallet node I had set up a while back


[08/21/2021 5:47 PM] zennethx#3207
and somehow I never backed up my phrase from my last setup


[08/21/2021 5:48 PM] zennethx#3207
so the address I was mining to is now just holding a few ERG as a lesson to me

@andeethanks looks like this could fix the problem. wont know until i get to the current block height!


[08/23/2021 9:38 PM] andee#4722
if you use a lot of browser extensions, use a separate browser for yoroi, metamask etc. if you have a lot of coins, install a linux distro on an old laptop and make your wallet there, don't connect it to internet. (works best for holding long term)


[08/23/2021 9:38 PM] bbot#6878
@andee  i like that idea. I have an old Mac laptop floating around that I can load it on


[08/23/2021 9:40 PM] andee#4722
there is a fix for database corruption in the upcoming node version. doing what I said fixes it in most cases as long as the node gets to sync without interruption, your coins aren't lost either way


[08/23/2021 9:42 PM] andee#4722
not very practical for spending though, I have yet to research signing transactions on a offline computer and broadcasting it on a connected one

Phones are typically connected to the internet, or will be very shortly after they are off line


[08/26/2021 11:38 PM] andee#4722
the whole point of the offline wallet is that it is not used online


[08/26/2021 11:39 PM] andee#4722
you use a an old phone as the offline wallet, and your current as the broadcaster


[08/26/2021 11:49 PM] vingallo22#2115
Agreed, should be entirely offline. 

It was stated as being an andoid app, android devices are not permanently offline, usually. 

For offline signing, android is not necessary; unless I misunderstood.


[08/26/2021 11:50 PM] vingallo22#2115
(For an example see MyEtherWallet offline, no phone involved in the process)


[08/26/2021 11:50 PM] vingallo22#2115
Would be great to see a similar functionality in Ergo


[08/26/2021 11:53 PM] Sezel#0619
Im just to scared that something happens to the hardware and you lose your offline wallet.


[08/26/2021 11:53 PM] Sezel#0619
If the phone breaks, or the USB dies. You're done for.


[08/26/2021 11:54 PM] Sezel#0619
While I don't think holding crypto on exchanges is 100% secure, i'd rather know it's held in a digital location, and not one that can physically fail.


[08/26/2021 11:54 PM] Sezel#0619
But tbh, I don't hold much crypto at any one time anyway, I spend mine on new GPUs.


[08/26/2021 11:56 PM] andee#4722
that EIP is for mobile wallets, but offline signing can also be implemented on desktop wallets. its just a lot easier to use a phone since the transfer of the transactions are done easily via QR codes


[08/26/2021 11:57 PM] andee#4722
and that's the reason the mnemonic should be written down and stored on several locations


[08/27/2021 7:43 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
The EIP and the concept is for mobile and desktop wallets, but the first implementation will be the mobile Android wallet.
There is a very easy way to get an Android device offline: turn flight mode on, don't set up wifi and don't insert a sim card. As @andersonps said, I think using a mobile device as a cold wallet is probably much easier than handling files on USB sticks to transfer data.

I will use it for integration tests on NodeJS and we will fix it if needed. I added all methods that I think will be needed, but maybe someone will find more.

If you restore if yoroi it might be easier, but I think now you've restored once and lost the derived addresses you need to derive them on node to get them back. @MrStahlfelge sound about right?

best is to ask in #node about that. only hint I can give is that there is a setting in the node if the generated addresses are eip3 compliant or not. this setting could be set different than before

good. there are two open source ios projects at the moment: a node client for ios by @Bauhaus911 , and a proof of concept project to compile appkit to ios with robovm by me. that's the two projects I am aware of you could start off from, or create something completely new

@Rockhound_1 As far as I know reading this channel it's already in progress. Also it was nicely explained by Armeanio in recent AMA with Kucoin that it's better to wait a bit, but make sure it's 100% safe.

It gives you them when you create it, you can't regenerate them. Best bet is to make a new wallet and send the coins there.

Hi! I initialize a ergo Node Wallet with Re-store wallet option with the 4.0.15 update. I'm using that address to receive $erg from mining. I received 1 $erg today from mining but it doesn't update my balance in the Node Wallet. When I look the address in the explorer I did see the 1 $erg updated balance. There's anything wrong with the sync of my Node Wallet?

Hello admin, may I ask a question.
I saw a fee to send to yoroi via ergo chain is 0,5 Erg. For now, that is reasonable price.
But may I know when Ergo higher around 50USDT, is this still ~0,5 Erg or it can be lower? If this still 0,5 Erg, I'm afraid it expensive same as ETH...


[11/01/2021 7:40 AM] glasgowm#9381
0.5 erg is whatever the exchange has charged you. Protocol fee is 0.001

Guys, what's the best way to set up an offline wallet? I'm looking to have multiple cold wallets until Ledger support finally comes in. I would be using the seed phrase from my Ledger to generate the addresses for the ERG coins and this would all be done on a machine that will permanently be offline. The only way I'd do transactions is by building them on an internet-connected machine and then have them signed on the other one. Does anyone have any pointers (to github, tutorials, anything)?

Is it safe?


[11/14/2021 12:23 AM] nitram147#5106
Depends on what do you mean by the term "safe"


[11/14/2021 12:25 AM] nitram147#5106
In case that the key derivation algorithm (from private key via BIP39 and BIP44 up to public keys) works as defined by the corresponding standards it should be safe


[11/14/2021 12:25 AM] nitram147#5106
this means that you will be able to access your funds using words printed on paper wallet


[11/14/2021 12:26 AM] nitram147#5106
however if you want to be sure that private keys don't leave your PC you should go as:


[11/14/2021 12:26 AM] nitram147#5106
1.) clone repo and build standalone static html/javascript page


[11/14/2021 12:26 AM] nitram147#5106
2.) copy static website to the USB key


[11/14/2021 12:27 AM] nitram147#5106
3.) make bootable USB key with some linux distribution (for example Ubuntu 20.04)


[11/14/2021 12:27 AM] nitram147#5106
4.) boot PC from USB key into live version of linux distro (option "Try Ubuntu")


[11/14/2021 12:28 AM] nitram147#5106
5.) if you have connected any RJ45 internet cable disconnect it


[11/14/2021 12:29 AM] nitram147#5106
6.) if you have hardware wifi switch on your notebook, or you have plugged wifi card into your PC disconnect it, do not enter wifi password to the live linux distro - you want to be sure that the running system do not have internet access


[11/14/2021 12:29 AM] nitram147#5106
7.) plug in usb with static website and open it


[11/14/2021 12:29 AM] nitram147#5106
8.) generate paper wallet


[11/14/2021 12:30 AM] nitram147#5106
9.) print it assuming that you can connect the printer to your live linux distro


[11/14/2021 12:32 AM] nitram147#5106
9.) better version of step 9.) would be to write down seed (wallet recovery words) on paper by hand & pen, and cover private key on the monitor with some paper and make photo of the rest of the generated paper wallet - this way you will have digital copy of QR code with deposit addresses and your private keys never left PC and did not go even not into printer (this can be helpful because some printers store files which have been printed in the past)


[11/14/2021 12:33 AM] nitram147#5106
10.) you can format USB stick with static webpage, and even format USB stick with live linux distro install


[11/14/2021 12:33 AM] nitram147#5106
11.) now you can turn off computer, remove usb stick, plug back RJ45 internet cable or switch back hardware wifi button (or plug back into usb, usb-wifi-card)


[11/14/2021 12:34 AM] nitram147#5106
This should be almost as secure way as the hardware wallet generation is


[11/14/2021 12:35 AM] nitram147#5106
However from the user experience point of view, it would be probably easier to use "cold wallet" function of the Ergo Wallet android app üôÇ

[11/16/2021 6:29 PM] Sascha#1206
hi all. i set up my ergo node some time ago and was able to access my wallet at first.. 
now i am mining away for a about 2 month and now tried to access the wallet again but my browser only sez..
This site can‚Äôt be reached
did you experience this before? what am i doing wrong?
i'm using this link  http://127.0.0.1:9053/panel/wallet , but it just sez:
This site can‚Äôt be reached 127.0.0.1 refused to connect.
i see some ppl already had this problem here but it was not clear if it was ever resolved.
the common solution seems to be to delete state and history folder then restart?

but idk how to restart the node
i found this snippet here
``` java -jar -Xmx3G``` but this would only give out a gazillion of possible arguments and nothing happens


[11/16/2021 6:38 PM] glasgowm#9381
It sounds like you just need to start the node again


[11/16/2021 6:39 PM] glasgowm#9381
same command you ran previously, if you hit the up arrow it might load. 

If not find your ergo directory and run

```
 java -jar -Xmx3G ergo-*.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf

Is the yoroi wallet bug fixed? I want to buy more erg, but damn, the devs gotta fix these basic things


[11/18/2021 12:21 AM] Radioactive#7078
bug?


[11/18/2021 10:58 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
People eager to check out the iOS port of the Android wallet can drop me a PM with their apple id and I will invite to the closed test.

you've got an invitation


[11/23/2021 5:16 PM] bryantramirez.eth#6665
Should I restore my wallet or create a new one? Also, do you guys provide ERGO to test the app ?


[11/23/2021 5:16 PM] bryantramirez.eth#6665
Just downloaded thankyou!


[11/23/2021 5:18 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
that's up to you. From my side, current test is intended for people eagerly waiting for an iOS wallet and wanting to contribute by testing so no ERG provided


[11/23/2021 5:22 PM] bryantramirez.eth#6665
Gotcha! Thank you!


[11/23/2021 5:30 PM] bryantramirez.eth#6665
Is there any specific things we can do with the wallet besides viewing balance, sending, and receiving ? Just wondering.


[11/23/2021 5:31 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
what else do you expect from a wallet?


[11/23/2021 5:33 PM] bryantramirez.eth#6665
not sure... I'm a newbie haha so that's why I'm asking.


[11/23/2021 5:33 PM] bryantramirez.eth#6665
Can we connect to ergodex or anything like that?


[11/23/2021 5:34 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
there's more to come, but you see the very first version on iOS.


[11/23/2021 5:34 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
no, but you can scan the qr codes on ergoutils or ergoauctions


[11/23/2021 5:35 PM] bryantramirez.eth#6665

cold wallet via android, paper-wallet, ledger being integrated in yoroi.


[11/27/2021 11:33 AM] albertokarlo#8169
@MrStahlfelge I installed de iOS wallet and it‚Äôs been working perfectly. 
-created a new wallet
-received ERG
-send ERG
-delete and import the wallet
-import a pre-existing wallet
-emptied the test wallet I created
No issues at all.
I think the UI/UX can be improved a lot to make it look and feel at the level of the tech behind it.  For really nice looking wallets for reference see Lumi and ALGO wallets on iOS.


[11/27/2021 11:41 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042

I am not an iOS user and can't really judge. On Android, I would really not like that design because it does not follow system's guidelines at all. 
I read Apple's guidelines for iOS and tried to follow them as good as possible, and for me it looks like the screenshots above aren't following them. Don't know if this is not as important on iOS as it is on Android, but I thought one of the reasons to use iOS is its look and feel?

Hi. I need help in setting up Ergo Nodes that have "scripts support" for my Ergo Wallet  (Desktop). I did follow the instruction as per the link --> https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Set-up-a-full-node.  However, I'm unable to get the API and network controller (for example, bound to "Port: 9030").  Kindly view the prompt message and the files under Folder "ergo-4.0.16"

depends on how fast your computer is, hard to give an estimate. 5-24 hours

@glasgowm thanks for your prompt response and advice. I have changed the config file format and now I know the problem - that is, I did not run the "touch ergo-conf". Now in the midst of syncing.

@glasgowm sorry I need your help or advice. I managed to access to Swagger UI in order to create my secret API (Hash) but when I access to panel to set my API key (for new wallet) but turns out the message prompted as "Bad API Key". I did update it the ergo-conf but is not working.  Any suggestion? Thanks.

[11/29/2021 10:05 AM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
Is 'hello myd' the new API key?


[11/29/2021 10:05 AM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
If so, that should be working, maybe you need to restart node so it picks up the new API key in the updated config file?


[11/29/2021 10:06 AM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
Though -sometimes-I get that message even after entering the key correctly. Retrying a couple times normally let's me in


[11/29/2021 10:17 AM] jsjs77#1210
Yes


[11/29/2021 10:18 AM] jsjs77#1210
Okay, I shall restart the node. Sorry, to restart the node is to type the same command --> java -jar -Xmx3G ergo-<release>.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf?


[11/29/2021 10:19 AM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
So that's to start it


[11/29/2021 10:19 AM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
There's a shutdown command in the swagger, but I'm pretty sure you have to supply the API key to execute that command


[11/29/2021 10:20 AM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
If you want to do a dirty shutdown just issue crtl + c in the terminal running it - it's never caused me any issues shutting down that way


[11/29/2021 10:21 AM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
BTW if you're on windows you can write that command into a batch file to start the node easily. If on Linux you can use a .sh file for the same purpose


[11/29/2021 10:22 AM] glasgowm#9381
```
curl -s "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/glasgowm148/23d5f1a8b6b9bcab70c5d739e863debf/raw/2419387cfe9f07870778365129f3cf46bf735deb/ergo_node.sh" | bash
```

should work on Linux/OSX (tested on OSX)


[11/29/2021 10:23 AM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
Does that pull the command from your github? Useful :)


[11/29/2021 10:24 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah pulls the commands and runs them - auto-generates and sets the API key to eliminate that headache


[11/29/2021 10:29 AM] jsjs77#1210
@HazeyOneKenobi Noted but I use Mac as my Windows corrupts all the time.


[11/29/2021 10:43 AM] jsjs77#1210
@HazeyOneKenobi @glasgowm I try to do restart the node but still the same although I've renamed it.


[11/29/2021 10:44 AM] jsjs77#1210
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:9053/utils/hash/blake2b" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "\"hellomyd\""

Are you using spaces in 'hello myd' when entering on the /panel webpage?

[11/29/2021 10:46 AM] jsjs77#1210

[11/29/2021 10:46 AM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
So it's 1. Do the call to /blake2b
2. Get the response of that call, copy and paste into config file
3. Restart node to pickup new API key hash


[11/29/2021 10:46 AM] jsjs77#1210
In Swagger? Okay


[11/29/2021 10:47 AM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
If everything is done right, maybe just let the node sync and try again once it is synced


[11/29/2021 10:47 AM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
Yeah so you get the /blake2b response, and replace the API key hash for 'hello' with the API key hash for whatever API key you have chosen


[11/29/2021 10:49 AM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
BTW you should deifnitely create a new different API key hash once you have this figured out üòÅ


[11/29/2021 10:49 AM] jsjs77#1210

[11/29/2021 10:54 AM] glasgowm#9381
The command above is tested on mac

You get the bad API key error sometimes when your database is corrupted

paste 
```
rm -rf .ergo/history
rm -rf .ergo/state
curl -s "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/glasgowm148/23d5f1a8b6b9bcab70c5d739e863debf/raw/2419387cfe9f07870778365129f3cf46bf735deb/ergo_node.sh" | bash
```


[11/29/2021 11:08 AM] jsjs77#1210
Do you want me to paste on it instead of curl?


[11/30/2021 5:33 PM] andee#4722
have you checked the output when you start the node? are you sure that your config is not named `ergo.conf.txt` ?


[11/30/2021 5:33 PM] andee#4722
does this work? `curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:9053/node/shutdown" -H "api_key: hellomyd"`


[12/01/2021 8:18 AM] jsjs77#1210
Yes, I have changed back to Plain Text in Mac.


[12/01/2021 9:17 AM] andee#4722
it can still save files with .txt extension though, should be an option under preferences. I dont know enough about macs to know if it will show, windows likes to hide .txt extensions when files are listed


[12/01/2021 9:32 AM] jsjs77#1210
yes, is different than Mac


[12/01/2021 9:45 AM] andee#4722
but the editor you use do have an option to add .txt to all plain text files: https://support.apple.com/guide/textedit/change-textedit-preferences-txted1063/mac


[12/01/2021 9:46 AM] andee#4722
seeing the output when you start the node could be helpful to see if it finds the supplied config


[12/01/2021 9:46 AM] andee#4722
the hash is correct for the password you use, so I dont see why it shouldnt work other than the config not being loaded

Hey I‚Äôm an NFT enthusiast, I‚Äôd love to start dabbling with Ergos market however I‚Äôm strictly an iOS user. 

Does the beta support these native tokens yet? If so are there any massive risk, on the technical side? Ofcourse there is massive inherent risk on the nft side lol


[12/05/2021 3:07 PM] glasgowm#9381
I think it does support them now maybe? @MrStahlfelge


[12/05/2021 3:09 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Open Beta does not support sending and showing tokens but they are safe. Closed beta supports sending/displaying


[12/05/2021 4:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Appreciate the response. Is closed beta still open? Or are you pushing people to the open beta now?


[12/05/2021 9:06 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
you can send me a dm to come to the closed beta. the reasoning behind this is the following: I push new versions to the closed beta, so this is a version to test the new features but things could also get broken somehow. The open beta is safe to use because the versions went through the closed beta before.

Do we have a view on when the iOS wallet will be in general circulation? Yoroi seems a little more stable today, but having watched my status flicker between High and Failed so frequently recently I‚Äôm still not full of confidence with it

Please help me, I'm losing my mind üò¶  || I'm mining ERG on a Yoroi wallet on Chrome, but now when I open it crashes, it also crashes on Chrome and Edge, also Yoroi Nightly crashes everywhere, I tried running and ERGO node but is not synincing and it's creating me a huge file (70gb until now), also tried ergo wallet beta app for iOs, but it's not restoring my wallet. Is there a way I can restore my wallet somewhere where it's gonna work? Now I'm thinking in buying an Android phone.. Thank you and sorry for the drama!


[12/08/2021 4:58 PM] glasgowm#9381
@MrStahlfelge can assist with the iOS issue in #üí≥„Éªwallet-app - what do you mean its not restoring the wallet?

try generating new addresses if the balance isnt there

[12/08/2021 6:58 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
check in yoroi if there are many addresses on the receive tab. ios wallet will only restore the main address at the moment

The very worst case you can import your seed into another wallet


[12/11/2021 7:00 PM] alexandru#0679
Yep, there are two.. does the update from today works with two? Or will in the close future?


[12/11/2021 9:23 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
close future, read as 4-6 weeks from now on


[12/11/2021 9:24 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
that said, as long as your yoroi works you can send everything you have to your main address and then you are fine

Hi, I have been using the android wallet for a while now. Unfortunately when I try to send some coins out I get this error messages "security error User changed or deleted their auth credentials" I have tried everything I can think of but nothing helps. Any ideas on how to reset the android wallet?


[12/12/2021 9:46 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
You need to restore the wallet from seed. 
The error says that you've saved your secrets device encrypted, but changed your device authentication method afterwards (added another finger to biometrics, changed passcode). This invalidates everything tied to the former auth method.


[12/12/2021 9:49 AM] BR88#5277
Thanks. Will do. I really like the wallet. clean and simple.

@MrStahlfelge Are you responsible for android and iOS wallets? I would like to request a feature: batch transactions. IE i can sent more than one transaction to chain before the previous approves. So if i have 3 transactions to do, i don't have to wait 2 to 5 minutes from the 1st to then send the 2nd manually. Is this a security issue or something potentially plausible?

Prevent sending transaction when there are unconfirmed transactions...
Steps to reproduce: Send an amount of ERGs to any address While the transaction is not confirmed, do it again The second transaction is discarded because it selected the same unspent boxes to spend...

[12/28/2021 11:23 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042

Hi @MrStahlfelge Ive been looking at the ergo wallet for android and how you can use a second device as a cold wallet to sign transactions through exchange of qr codes


[01/01/2022 3:03 PM] Nick [·¥è ü·¥á·¥ú·¥ç]#2333
I think its an excellent idea, and wondered if you had any plans to do the same with a cardano wallet or to add cardano support to the wallet for Ergo


[01/01/2022 3:05 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Thanks! No we don't plan to add any other coins. I agree that it is odd no one else added such a feature. It should be possible on most platforms.


[01/01/2022 3:06 PM] Nick [·¥è ü·¥á·¥ú·¥ç]#2333
Exactly! I think theres potential for a really great addition to the ecosystem, if there was cold signing and connection to ergodex even better as it will be supporting cardano also


[01/01/2022 3:07 PM] Nick [·¥è ü·¥á·¥ú·¥ç]#2333
I was wondering if you had considered applying to Cardano Catalyst project to get some funding to do it?


[01/01/2022 3:09 PM] Nick [·¥è ü·¥á·¥ú·¥ç]#2333
I think theres a very high probability you could get funded


[01/01/2022 4:35 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Cold signing for dapps will come soon, but it's depending on dapps to integrate it.
Regarding cardano, I am working full steam for ergo. But the idea is in the world and anybody can adopt

[01/01/2022 10:05 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
It needs Android 7 but S4 should be capable of running a newer custom rom


[01/01/2022 10:05 PM] Nick [·¥è ü·¥á·¥ú·¥ç]#2333
hmm yeah it came with 4.4.4 originally

so android 7 should work whatever the device?


[01/01/2022 10:11 PM] Nick [·¥è ü·¥á·¥ú·¥ç]#2333
If its a case of a custom firmware, is this easier than back in the day (2015ish) cos it used to be a bit of a pain with changing bootloader and stuff


[01/01/2022 10:13 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
It's a bit of effort the first time but it depends on your skill level. It's not really hard to do. And every galaxy s has really good custom rom support


[01/01/2022 10:15 PM] Nick [·¥è ü·¥á·¥ú·¥ç]#2333
I can see several for the s3 , yeah soundslike its still a bit hit and miss first time out but then its fine


[01/01/2022 10:17 PM] Nick [·¥è ü·¥á·¥ú·¥ç]#2333
DO you know of a custom firmware that will run the wallet software, then I can look into whether its compatible with either s3 or s4


[01/01/2022 10:18 PM] Nick [·¥è ü·¥á·¥ú·¥ç]#2333
Im sorry to ask a bunch of android questions but they are kinda important


[01/01/2022 10:20 PM] Nick [·¥è ü·¥á·¥ú·¥ç]#2333
is it possible to compile for older versions of android ? I wish I knew what was involved cos I'd be prepared to put some time in, Im retired so I have time to do stuff on and off


[01/02/2022 1:02 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I usually just use linageOS, the Moto G in my demonstration video is also running the latest lineageOS that was built for that device


[01/02/2022 1:05 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
it's always possible, but there's a reason I drew the line with 7.0. 6.1 and 6.0 are possible with some drawbacks for users running newer devices, but running on 5.0 or below is a major problem because a lot of security features that we are using were added for 6.0. I am all for supporting older versions, but I think it is not worth it given how easy it is to update older devices.


[01/02/2022 6:59 PM] giblits#5270
I'm curious what Nautilus Wallet will bring to the ecosystem? Is it just another wallet (which is great to have choices) but does it have any features that others like Yoroi don't at this point?


[01/02/2022 7:22 PM] glasgowm#9381
It's aimed more at the non-custodial/DarkFi aspect - integrating stuff like the mixer API


[01/02/2022 7:23 PM] giblits#5270
Thank you Glasgow!


[01/03/2022 9:48 AM] kpolfi#7671
Question about node wallet: I've made 2 wallets with initializing on Windows machine. Wallets work fine there, but if i restore that wallet from the seed phrase on Yoroi or iOS wallet, it generates 0.0 balance wallet with different address. Is there something I'm missing here?


[01/03/2022 10:09 AM] andee#4722
You probably created the node wallet with a mnemonic password in addition to the wallet password


[01/03/2022 11:35 AM] kpolfi#7671
On initialization it replied: Your wallet successfully initialized. Please save your mnemonic - and then 15 words. 

And then I have a password that can lock the wallet.


[01/03/2022 11:50 AM] andee#4722
What version node? I think the mnemonic password was recently hidden since it seemed to cause confusion


[01/03/2022 11:52 AM] andee#4722
There was 2 password inputs by default previously (maybe still). One was the password to unlock the wallet file saved on your disk and the other was a password that makes your mnemonic worthless without also having the password


[01/03/2022 12:19 PM] kpolfi#7671
4.0.19 version. But probably I cannot use other wallet-apps with those seeds then. Thanks for the info


[01/03/2022 12:26 PM] andee#4722
The seed should work just fine in other wallet apps, node, yoroi etc follow the same standard


[01/03/2022 2:29 PM] kpolfi#7671
Have I created it as seed phrase + password so that is not supported with Yoroi or what is the issue? 

But there should be way to create wallet from the node that could be imported to Yoroi as well?


[01/03/2022 2:44 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yeah seed phrase and password is not supported by other wallets. you need to create a wallet without using a password

Does anyone have any information on a possible integration of ergo in the project one wallet that iohk is developing ? If not, would it be possible to enter in contact with them for a possible partnership ? Being supported by such a promising wallet would give its users access to the many dapps that the ergo ecosystem possesses

@kpolfi if you set a mnemonic password it will not work in other wallets, right now anyways. If you want a portable mnemonic set only wallet password

[01/05/2022 4:13 AM] JacobMichael#8318
The updated wallet will need to be downloaded from the App Store, and you‚Äôll likely need to re-enter your seed phrase, but your ergo isn‚Äôt going anywhere.

[01/06/2022 9:52 AM] kpolfi#7671
Returning to this. Trying to create second wallet 400 *Wallet is already initialized or testMnemonic is set. Clear current secret to re-init it.* So only 1 wallet at a time?


[01/06/2022 10:09 AM] andee#4722
Probably have to delete the existing wallet, might be better to just backup the different wallet folders ü§î


[01/06/2022 10:13 AM] kpolfi#7671
But I want to have 2 wallets working at the same time. Like in Yoroi I can, or in mobile App I can. If I must delete the existing to create/restore new, then I always end up with only 1


[01/06/2022 10:23 AM] andee#4722

I'll check what can be done with the nipopows when they are implemented. Would be good to not trust the explorer, or to have a way to validate what the explorer returned.

Hopefully. You can technically set up a full node on a raspberry, I have one running right now, but it‚Äôs a pain in the ass


[01/09/2022 11:32 AM] Donalddd#2998
What's the issue?


[01/09/2022 11:36 AM] JCAP#8273
The node crashes while building history. I suspect there‚Äôs a memory leak somewhere. PCs capable enough can handle it just fine without crashing until it‚Äôs synced, raspberry‚Äôs can‚Äôt. I had to build the node on my mac and then copy it to my raspberry.

However at the time I was using an old version of the java file, idk if the new one helps


[01/09/2022 11:39 AM] Donalddd#2998
Maybe the new raspberry can handle it if it's just resources problem. I was wondering if it has to do with the os or requirements.


[01/09/2022 11:39 AM] Donalddd#2998
So the problem is the initialization.


[01/09/2022 11:40 AM] Donalddd#2998
Again, probably with nipopows this will be much more efficient


[01/09/2022 11:40 AM] Donalddd#2998

Hello, I just had a quick question about the Android wallet. I sent Ergo from kucoin to my wallet 15hrs ago and it came in the wallet as "unconfirmed" (which has been normal for all my other transactions) but stayed like that for 8hrs then now has gone away without the ergo actually entering the wallet. Does this sometimes take a long time or could I have done something wrong? (I have sent to this wallet quite a number of times no issue) thanks for any help or advice.


[01/10/2022 12:12 PM] blackinsecure#3693

[01/12/2022 8:38 AM] Donalddd#2998
hi @glasgowm , yoroi suddenly stopped working completely. The thing is I didn't only have ergo wallets there but also cardano ones, now I can't access it at all. I guess this is the issue you have been talking about. How to process now? I guess I need to restore one by one all my wallets? Or I can wait for an update from emurgo to fix this issue? I am not sure this was even caused by ergo, since I can't access any of the wallet, yoroi goes blank page before even selecting a wallet, just on startup.


[01/12/2022 8:39 AM] Donalddd#2998
last transaction I did yesterday was using dripdropz for cardano. I didn't even touch ergo, and I had done the procedure to consolidate all UTXOs into one as suggested.

[01/14/2022 5:25 AM] davidcodes#2138
@Cheese Enthusiast @lgd  so appkit makes an api request to a node to figure out the unspentboxes of an address.
Going down the rabbit hole it seems that call would end up in [1]. 

Question, Eventually if there is an explosion in the number of boxes in ergo, would that massively affect the time the unspent boxes per address ? or are boxes "indexed" in a way that this query is super cheap to do?

[01/14/2022 5:27 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I imagine this is less of a network issue and more an issue for the address owner. It is why wallets like yoroi have the ability to consolidate all wallet utxos into a single new utxo.


[01/14/2022 5:29 AM] davidcodes#2138
interesting. One could think of it as a : "defragmentation" tool.
If those UTXOs did not contain a bunch of coins, but instead, lets say , 1000 NFTs this would not be possible tho ü§î  ?


[01/14/2022 5:31 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Don‚Äôt see why it would be impossible. All the utxos containing the nfts would output to one new utxo containing each nft. The biggest limit that this might have is that the amount of data from each token id may eventually hit the max size limit for a box (4096 bytes). In that case 2  or more utxos could be made to consolidate the inputs.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[01/14/2022 5:39 AM] davidcodes#2138
Interesting. Presumably a wallet that reads all NFTs of a user would have to assume there could be more than one NFT per box. I guess that presupposes some sort of std over how to store NFT data in a box .


[01/14/2022 5:41 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Yeah, I believe NFT data is taken from the registers of the original box that minted the nft. Not entirely sure though, havent worked with nfts on ergo just yet.

[01/18/2022 8:45 AM] Donalddd#2998
however I just wanted to give a quick feedback on alternative wallets, I have tried the ccvault one and it is way better than yoroi.

I know that Yoroi is on the works for ergo but it is not ergo faults, yoroi is slow for cardano as well. It could be considered to checkout if it is possible to intergrate other wallets. They seem to move way faster than yoroi with both adoption and updates.

try one from the list here https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/blob/0e8ac97199927315ad17ccbdb101aad3f9dc31bc/src/main/resources/mainnet.conf#L50
note that you only have to change the IP, keep the port 9053 and don't change to 9030

[01/24/2022 7:59 PM] Attila#3944
do NOT use ViaWallet. I had 400 NETA in my wallet from which I sent a couple ERG using ViaWallet. Even though I know it doesn't support tokens yet I think it should at least not destroy them. Maybe I'm missing something but my tokens seem to be gone. TX here: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/transactions/3cfb135debfca43e5aa0e094fe82e77e82ca5d81a40d338df15d0c8be91e991d


[01/24/2022 8:03 PM] Attila#3944
This is my wallet. After the NETA airdrop the single tx I had was sending some ERG to my yoroi nightly wallet for the aneta swap airdrop and the tokens were lost during that tx. https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/addresses/9hv7rBzN6m4xPKjcEabwn8hZveGxfGqtEVHu4ip2Y4GYSqFthhx

Lazy programming? X erg to receiving address, the rest to burn?


[01/24/2022 8:55 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
You can't burn ERG, but token can be burned in a tx. To not do that, they have to be sent back to the address that holds the box that is spent during the tx. Viawallet does not do that.


[01/24/2022 8:56 PM] Attila#3944

We have community members throwing some crazy wallets at the dApp Connector. 

Today we had a tester bring a dust monster wallet with a 14k transaction history.

Result: rapid sync and connect. 

Wallet load testing and improvements are still underway.

yoroi has syncing problems if your wallet has 50+ transactions


[02/01/2022 5:34 PM] blackinsecure#3693
the mobile wallet is much more efficient, I'd use that one


[02/01/2022 5:35 PM] vexorg#0768
Yeah I have heard that yoroi has problems, I've just recently gone over 85 transactions


[02/01/2022 5:36 PM] blackinsecure#3693
yeah, you're much better by using the mobile one


[02/01/2022 5:36 PM] vexorg#0768
I had generated a few extra addrs in the same yoroi wallet, if I restore from the seed phrase, I presume that the balance on those addrs is lost?

no, you can recover those addresses in the mobile Ergo Wallet settings

Are there any cons to using the mobile wallet? Or are there any "sketchy" permissions that the app requires from the phone?

Nope, made by a core dev. Doesn't work with ergodex is the only downside


[02/01/2022 11:03 PM] Elemental#9509
Gonna be honest.. I completely forgot what that was lol so I don't believe ergodex would be of any use to me. I simply need a more secure and reliable wallet so I can transfer my ergo from yoroi because I don't like their new permission requirements

Hey @HipHopBlond By chance, do you know how exactly I'm supposed to restore my wallet from yoroi?


[02/02/2022 1:42 AM] Elemental#9509
I entered my yoroi seed phrase but it keeps telling me I need to add 11 more words


[02/02/2022 1:42 AM] Elemental#9509
no matter how many words i put


[02/02/2022 1:43 AM] HipHopBlond#9606
add some random words (not your actual phrase) and send us a screenshot from your phone


[02/02/2022 1:46 AM] HipHopBlond#9606
and don't use commas (I think)


[02/02/2022 1:47 AM] HipHopBlond#9606
and add an interval between words


[02/02/2022 2:06 AM] Elemental#9509
how do I separate the words then?


[02/02/2022 2:06 AM] HipHopBlond#9606

[02/02/2022 2:20 AM] HipHopBlond#9606
so did you restore it?


[02/02/2022 3:01 AM] Elemental#9509
yeah we're good now. at first, i had the space but it would still tell me 11 more words were missing


[02/02/2022 3:02 AM] Elemental#9509
just restarted the app and it worked fine

[02/02/2022 3:06 AM] Elemental#9509
Also just so I understand how ergo and the wallets work.. so I can continue sending my ergo to my original yoroi address and it would still show up on the app, correct?


[02/02/2022 3:06 AM] Elemental#9509
I'm just curious to know if like yoroi isn't actually the wallet, but simply a dashboard for one


[02/02/2022 3:11 AM] Elemental#9509
Like, is my address not actually FROM yoroi? but rather from the ergo blockchain, and my seed phrase is also from the ergo block chain?


[02/02/2022 8:51 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
something in between. yoroi calcs a key from your seed phrase which has a private part and a public part. the public part is your address, private part is kept secret. everything public is on the blockchain, your funds are stored there as well. wallet app uses the same algorithm to calc your key from your seed phrase, so you also have access


[02/02/2022 8:53 AM] Elemental#9509
So just to confirm, my wallet app address from my recovered yoroi address are the same, correct?


[02/02/2022 8:53 AM] Elemental#9509
Just making sure if I need to make a new address or if I can continue sending Ergo to the address I got from yoroi


[02/02/2022 8:59 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
they are the same, just compare the addresses.
and keep in mind that yoroi uses multiple addresses, so maybe it is needed to add more in wallet app (wallet config -> addresses)

@MrStahlfelge , I'm trying to transfer my ERG from Yoroi to the Ergo mobile wallet on iOS but when entering my recovery phrase I'm getting an error which says 'Some words are missing from your mnemonic. Add at least 11 more.' This is after adding my whole recovery phrase spaced with commas.

Sorry if this is trivial. I am trying to setup the iOS wallet app as read only wallet, but it doesn't accept the "xpub" from Yoroi (Settings/Wallet/Export). Neither by scanning the QR code, nor by copy pasting the "key" Yoroi exposes under export. 

The iOS app does accept individual receiving addresses from Yoroi, but given it's a UTXO chain I find that very limiting. 

What am I doing wrong?


[02/13/2022 1:05 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
nothing wrong, it is just not supported yet.
issue is here https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-wallet-app/issues/32
and yes, it is in the works right now and will come, probably for 1.7, if not then for 1.8

In order to have a smoother experience between the Ergo&#39;s wallets, it would be great if a way to derive addresses from the wallet&#39;s Extended Public Key was implemented by reading it...

Since yesterday I've tested nautilus and mobile wallets, both ios and android versions and it's really smooth! Decided to try SAFEW too but I'm having some issues, it crashes when I try to sign a transaction


[02/13/2022 3:52 PM] borggren4#2511
Is Nautilus still in beta? Has Kushti done security audit? Is it considered safe to deposit all Ergo funds onto there?

Hello, i'm safew dev, what kind of crashes are you facing ? Would you have an error message?


[02/13/2022 8:54 PM] apiapason#9322
So I restored a wallet in safew and then tried to send some erg, it prompts me to sign but after I press sign, it just freezes and the wallet doesn't respond until I restart the browser. I'm using brave browser, could that be an issue?


[02/14/2022 12:01 AM] haileypdll#3353
Brave is supposed to work. Maybe there are many addresses in your wallet ? Or many different accounts ?

@MrStahlfelge just installed Ergo Wallet on iOS and have a strange behavior. Namely, it's only considering 1 (one) of the public addresses of my wallets, and not all of them (I have used different addresses for different transactions, as one usually does). Is this expected behavior? I can provide more info if that helps. Thanks.


[02/18/2022 11:40 PM] fqv#2223
Nevermind. It worked after a while. I guess it was loading or something. It took about 30 minutes FYI.


[02/19/2022 5:47 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042

I used the SAFEW wallet for csv export and then manually track price data at dates and times using ergo.watch for sigrsv and these charts for the rest: https://jimmyhoffa.github.io/ergo-market-charts/

Manually enter your transactions into koinly with price data from those sources, use their placeholder tokens for things like rsv


[03/14/2022 8:20 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
how exactly should such an integration look like?


[03/14/2022 8:33 AM] lgd#5847
Idk anything about how to develop a wallet, that is why I wanted to gauge interest first. In really simple terms, it would let you generate GuapSwap proxy address, perform a swap with ergodex, and maybe keep track of your swap txs.


[03/14/2022 8:35 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
ah I see. count me in for interest and support you in getting things done to work in the mobile wallets.

Can you send me more details about GuapSwap?
Transaction details and ...


[03/14/2022 9:04 AM] lgd#5847
Okok, I was just trying to gauge interest first. We just finished our v1.0.1-beta for people to use now, but we are working on v2 atm and will change a lot. The biggest change we are including is multi-token swaps for miners and a way to organize everything so that it is dex independent. But theoretically, once integrated into a wallet, anybody could use guapswap, not just miners.

Everything is in our github.

[03/14/2022 12:13 PM] haileypdll#3353
The feature seems interesting, but not sure how it could be integrated. There will be a requirement to run the jar on the local machine ?


[03/14/2022 12:18 PM] lgd#5847
The GuapSwap linked above is a CLI meant to be run on a machine. The point of integrating into a wallet would be to not have that and somehow part of the wallet itself. Not sure if that makes any sense. For a desktop wallet, I guess you could have it running by passing commands to it from the wallet backend, maybe there is a better way to do this though idk. This is why I was asking you guys.


[03/14/2022 12:33 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
for that to say we need to know what the thing should be capable to do. when it is about executing transactions, ergopay is the way to go for the mobile wallets


[03/14/2022 12:35 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
for showing own screens within the wallet we need to talk how to do that. however, on mobile platforms it is not allowed to load code from a jar so you'll need to set up a spring server with a rest api that executes the code on your server. more convinient to update anyway


[03/14/2022 12:41 PM] lgd#5847
This is what we would do if we ran our own website, definitely makes it more complicated though. Maybe this is stupid question, but is there no way to get appkit to work on mobile? Or maybe would this be better as a standalone mobile application? If integrated into Nautilus for example, it would have to be rewritten for a web browser or like you suggested access our server. Will have to rethink this. Maybe it is too much for a wallet to integrate.


[03/14/2022 12:47 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
appkit works on mobile, it is part of the wallet. but you need your own code on top of it.
to keep everything decentralized instead of setting up a central server online, you could integrate a http server in your client application the users run within their network. this way, all applications on the network can access it with the ip address. but: expect users not to do this because it is effort, and most users don't want to have effort. for some power users it is a nice feature though


[03/14/2022 12:51 PM] lgd#5847
So as an example, if I wanted to fork ergo mobile wallet on Android, could I add an extra "view" in the app that would let me perform a swap by including the GuapSwap code as part of the wallet itself?


[03/14/2022 12:52 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yes that would work


[03/14/2022 12:52 PM] lgd#5847
Okok hmmm maybe this is better option lol. Like anetaBTC.


[03/14/2022 12:53 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042

Okok I see. That will be a cool feature.

Audit means that there is a deep review regarding security and does not mean the software is bug free.

What is happening to yoroi wallet?


[03/28/2022 5:45 AM] blackinsecure#3693
not good to handle addresses with 50+ transaction history. Recommend using Ergo Wallet Mobile available on Play Store and Apple testflight or other wallets like Nautilus and SAFEW


[03/28/2022 12:33 PM] nitram147#5106
It has also probably problem with handling big transaction (transactions with a large number of outputs)


[03/28/2022 12:34 PM] nitram147#5106
Mi Goreng air drop seems to make unusable yoroi wallet of many of my friends


[03/28/2022 12:35 PM] nitram147#5106
It could be easily fixed, yoroi don't need to load and store whole transaction's details in it history - it could be fetched on demand when clicking on transaction details...


[03/28/2022 12:36 PM] nitram147#5106
However I don't think that somebody would fix this ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[03/28/2022 12:36 PM] nitram147#5106
This bug highly probably affect also cardano in yoroi.


[03/28/2022 12:38 PM] SoCool#6419
Nobody in Cardano or Ergo uses Yoroi anymore, it's no longer under active development and is non-functional. In Ergo use Nautilus, SAFEW, Ergo Mobile, Minotaur


[03/28/2022 12:46 PM] nitram147#5106
I don't use yoroi in ergo anymore (it's quite a while since I stopped using it), I was just answering that it has not only problem handling a lot of transactions but there's also problem with handling a few huge transactions...


[03/28/2022 12:46 PM] nitram147#5106
How do you know that "nobody in cardano is using yoroi"? ü§î


[03/28/2022 12:47 PM] SoCool#6419
Well, as with Ergo - some are, but it doesn't work well so people using the dApps have moved to ccvault and NAMI because Yoroi is problematic for them as well

Newb question


[03/28/2022 4:53 PM] Avgby#5032
Can i use my recovery phrases (which were obtained when creating ergo wallet from yoroi) to recover my ergo wallet from different app?


[03/28/2022 5:02 PM] Avgby#5032
And what is the best wallet app for ergo? Yoroi used to be ok but not working anymore


[03/28/2022 6:46 PM] blackinsecure#3693
yes, just use the same seed phrase in a different wallet


[03/28/2022 6:47 PM] blackinsecure#3693
I really like the Ergo Wallet mobile


[03/28/2022 6:48 PM] Avgby#5032

Only for android? Is there ios version?


[03/28/2022 6:49 PM] blackinsecure#3693
there's an iOS version but it still in the testflight since Apple takes longer to approve apps but u still can use it

[04/03/2022 1:44 AM] bambi#6770
So, I used my recovery phase from my Yoroi Wallet, on a new wallet Nautilus.  Does it take time for my Ergo to sync over?


[04/03/2022 3:04 PM] SoCool#6419
No, if you don't see it in Nautilus you may have gotten a word wrong; look at the address Nautilus lists - it should be identical to the address for yoroi. You can check the address in the explorer as well.

If the address isn't the same as what's in Yoroi likely you got a word in your mnemonic out of order or wrong or etc


[04/03/2022 9:59 PM] bambi#6770
ok thank you, do i need to deactivate the yoroi wallet b4 I activate the nautilus wallet?


[04/03/2022 10:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
nope just restore - you'll need to deactive the yoroi plugin if you don't want it to conflict when you try and use the dApp connector though.


[04/04/2022 5:22 AM] Jasp3r#6111
Is Nautilus the best for erg? I have everything in yoroi currently.


[04/04/2022 5:23 AM] SoCool#6419
Wallets don't hold funds in Erg, so install Nautilus and use your recovery phrase from Yoroi and it'll get you access to the same funds; your funds live on chain


[04/04/2022 5:23 AM] SoCool#6419
You don't have your funds "in yoroi"


[04/04/2022 5:23 AM] SoCool#6419
Yoroi has your phrase for accessing your funds on the blockchain. Install nautilus and use the same phrase and it'll be able to get them then.


[04/04/2022 5:24 AM] SoCool#6419
SAFEW too. Ergo mobile too


[04/04/2022 5:24 AM] Jasp3r#6111
ahh i see


[04/04/2022 5:24 AM] Jasp3r#6111
what would you rec


[04/04/2022 5:24 AM] SoCool#6419
SAFEW and Nautilus are both great, try them both and see which you prefer. Yoroi - disable it in chrome extensions but don't uninstall it until you have everything working in another wallet; Yoroi is unstable and behaves poorly.


[04/04/2022 5:25 AM] SoCool#6419
Try all the others and choose for yourself, they each work well and have different interfaces and some different features


[04/04/2022 5:27 AM] Jasp3r#6111
Alright sounds good. I just have security concerns so ill stick with the trade and true nautilus and safew


[04/04/2022 5:34 AM] Jasp3r#6111

If you hold KDA and use xWallet you might be like me and not want to switch back and forth between safari and chrome just to use a wallet.

So i ported the x-Wallet over to safari.

[04/11/2022 5:44 PM] MGpai#4313
then shouldnt it be on them to make the node private?


[04/11/2022 6:51 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Sure, that should be done as you should also lock doors you don't want others to enter. But I would not enter unlocked doors when not invited as well so it is good to have a sign that using the service is okay, IMHO

Did you see my node script I wrote that does this? It was using ergo spyder but that went bunk so I updated it the other day to just start with a root node (kushti's hard coded as root node) and recursively crawls known nodes from there (finds 600+) then checks their 9053 and their reported port as well for version info https://gist.github.com/JimmyHoffa/7dbbb4b43ef09e97984447677fc6eb71

The format is somewhat weird compared to Yorois. Not recognized by some tax software.


[06/10/2022 7:44 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I think one of the problems is that none of us developers use a tax software. I already asked some people requesting better export to define the output format that should be used, but got no replies so far. if you define how the output format should be and open an issue on SAFEW's github, maybe hailypdll will change the format or other developers have the chance to get on this task.

It's not the blockchain itself opening a bank account, just the Ergo Foundation. Problem something due to a lot of the EF being Russian and Russian related sanctions. If I was a bank I probably wouldn't touch it either

I made none, but 100k different tokens would probably cause the UI viewtree that displays the elements to crash or something.

Question about the Ledger integration. I understand that on Nano S and S+ the app can be sideloaded while this is not a possibility on Nano X. I also understand (saw the tweets from Ledger) that they are currently reviewing the app and once that is done it will be available on X too. 

What I am unsure about is this "no sideload on Nano X" thing. Many of the apps on Nano X are under the experimental mode section (you need to turn this on in Ledger Live). For example, the Fantom app is only available in experimental mode for more than a year at this stage. So when you start the Fantom app Ledger tells you "Pending ledger review", yet you can use it.

So it looks to me that there is a way to get to the Nano X faster via the experimental apps, is it not the case? And if yes, isn't this something Ergo should pursue?


[08/28/2022 9:22 PM] glasgowm#9381
The addition of that flag crashes the app, it is to get it on the app store under the experimental section. Side-loading is when you load manually, not through the ledger manager


[08/29/2022 8:56 PM] gl#2103
I am not sure I fully follow. Are you saying that there is a bug in the Ergo app that causes a crash if it's built or deployed as an experimental app? If yes, I guess that crash could be fixed....? 

I am just trying to understand why is it that other apps managed to get to the Ledger "app store" while they are still under review by Ledger (which can be a real lengthy process), but not the Ergo app.


[08/29/2022 9:13 PM] glasgowm#9381
They're trying to list it on their app store but there's a bug on their end  causing the app to crash. We are waiting for them to fix it as they are having the same issue with another coin.

[09/21/2022 11:33 PM] gl#2103
Ok, so this is my lack of knowledge in Ergo, but I would have assumed that like BTC wallets the Ergo wallets (I am using the Android wallet) automatically generates new receiving addresses for privacy reasons. Instead the wallet seems to operate by default like an Ethereum wallet, providing a single receiving address. I figured out now that I can manually "add addresses" if I want, but it's pretty hidden and I presume this is somehow not the main flow. Anyone knows why this is? 

Also, is there any way to see my actual UTXOs in the Android wallet app?


[09/22/2022 8:06 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
there is no main flow on ergo, the different wallets have different behaviour. the flow you are looking for is provided by Nautilus which has a provacy-first approach. the mobile wallet has a least-impact approach, holding the number of addresses to sync small. every added address needs another sync call, so ending up with thousands of addresses is not suitable for a platform that can have slow or unstable connections.


[09/22/2022 8:08 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
the utxo's are hidden from the user, mainly because the information is confusing for the common user and not of any help. interested to hear what's your use case to see them.


[09/22/2022 3:33 PM] gl#2103
Thanks for the answers. My questions stems from the fact that I am a BTC guy and have always used Electrum, Sparrow, Specter and wallets like that. I simply like knowing what is happening under the hood and be able to customize things if I want (e.g. select which UTXO I want to put as an input to a transaction). 

I 100% agree that this is not for the "average user", but I would just note that Cardano wallets (like Daedalus and others) do show UTXOs. I understand that Cardano != Ergo, but both are systems based on UTXOs so at least for advanced users it might be worth exposing those (IMHO).

Is there a way to add passphrase/25th word to a wallet in the iOS/Android apps? @MrStahlfelge ?


[12/15/2022 3:45 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Simply restore with an added word. It will warn that the mnemonic is not valid but you can ignore it


[12/15/2022 3:46 PM] gl#2103
Interesting. So any added word (not from the BIP39 list) will work as expected?

Yes

Hey, sorry about the noob question but could someone explain how to check wallet balance with a public key? I have had some ERG for a while in few exchanges but withdrew them into a paper wallet created with ergopaperwallet.org. So I have a public key and three different addresses that I have all used. I can check all the balances of the individual addresses but I thought that they would be available in one wallet like in Cardano.


[12/23/2022 3:22 PM] cafebedouin#9837
If you imported the seed from the paper wallet into one of the other wallets, it would show you derived addresses. If you are checking addresses in explorer, then you need to check them individually. Paper is just more manual work to check, but they are all in the same wallet.


[12/23/2022 5:10 PM] amuse#7014
Ok, thanks! I'll wait until we get a Ledger support. For now the paper wallet is good enough for me.

you guys have any luck using Tor browser with these wallets?  Especially for connecting to dApps? Seems like safeW connects, but had issues actually doing txs in ergopad.

You can get transaction history to CSV using the SAFEW wallet.


[12/25/2022 9:46 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Have you considered using Ergopay? Mobile, scan QR? Because connecting using a dApp implies turning on JavaScript, which undermines much of the point of using Tor. https://support.torproject.org/glossary/javascript/

For Spectrum, SAFEW as the browser extension, do the trade and scan the QR code on phone with Ergo Mobile Wallet pointing to your own node that uses Tor. You could also have SAFEW in a Tor browser, I suppose.

i created a read only wallet on ergo mobile wallet from the QR code on safew desktop/browser extension


[12/26/2022 7:41 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Two devices, PC and scanning with phone. It is possible to use an offline second phone as a cold wallet. But, the read only wallet is normally in SAFEW.


[12/26/2022 7:41 PM] cafebedouin#9837
It is possible to do regular transactions using only mobile.


[12/26/2022 7:42 PM] cafebedouin#9837
But, not sure if that works with Tor. Talking about Spectrum now.


[12/26/2022 7:45 PM] e‚àèo‚à´‚à´o#5421
ya so, i'm using desktop with phone. i scanned the initial "unsigned?" tx, opting for ErgoPay instead of connecting a wallet directly. Then it requires another scan, whose QR shows up on the mobile device to "Scan signed tx"


[12/26/2022 7:45 PM] e‚àèo‚à´‚à´o#5421
this is on Spectrum


[12/26/2022 7:47 PM] e‚àèo‚à´‚à´o#5421
i guess i would need a scanner camera on my desktop


[12/26/2022 7:47 PM] e‚àèo‚à´‚à´o#5421
or just somehow share the QR code back to my desktop or another screen


[12/26/2022 7:47 PM] e‚àèo‚à´‚à´o#5421
maybe i messed up somewhere tho


[12/26/2022 9:26 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Right, normally, it's desktop, hot phone, cold phone signing. Or, you can just put the keys in the hot phone, sign and delete the wallet, if you are comfortable with that.

ah i c. i would need another device. I am unfamiliar with cold wallets rn, but keep my seed phrases stored physically. So you're saying to use ErgoPay, i would need a cold wallet device also? Can this only be another phone or what other devices are there that can accomplish this? Thx in advance.


[12/26/2022 9:34 PM] e‚àèo‚à´‚à´o#5421
ok, sorry, just reread that. guess that's also an option

Ledger on X, yay üôÇ 

Can someone please explain what does the "Never send more than 20 distinct tokens in a single transaction to a Ledger wallet" warning means exactly? 

This is clearly not about not having more than 20 UTXOs. But then what is it about? What does "distinct tokens" mean?


[01/06/2023 8:59 PM] glasgowm#9381
sending 4 ERG, 2 SigUSD, 300 SigRSV would be 3 distinct tokens


[01/06/2023 9:00 PM] gl#2103
I see, OK. So it's highly unlikely that someone would normally hit the 20 limit, thanks.


[01/06/2023 9:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
well unless they hit send all and have a bunch of NFTs or something :)


[01/06/2023 9:00 PM] gl#2103
right


[01/07/2023 2:20 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Not as uncommon as you might think. Between staking NFTs through Ergopad, buying audio tracks on Terahertz, liquidity pool tokens, etc, etc, it can happen easier than you might think.


[01/07/2023 3:03 PM] gl#2103
So I was playing with the app on Nano X and unfortunately it seems like the Ledger app and the Ergo Android app generates different addresses from the same seed + passphrase. 

Scenarios:

Same 24 words on Ledger and Android app: same Ergo main address.
Same 24 words + passphrase (25th word) on Ledger and Android app: different Ergo main addresses.

I entered the 25th word on Android as @MrStahlfelge instructed earlier: simply adding it as the 25th word when restoring the wallet to the input box. The Android app showed a warning, but as per instructions from earlier this was expected. 

I made the experiment several times, I am 100% positive I entered the same 24 words and the same 25th word on both Ledger and the Android app.


[01/07/2023 3:05 PM] gl#2103
(if it matters, I used Nautilus to connect to Ledger and export the public key; Nautilus shows the same address as Ledger, the device itself, so I am confident it is really the address that Ledger generated and not some Nautilus bug)


[01/07/2023 3:05 PM] gl#2103
TL;DR: Ledger app and Android app generates different addresses if 25th word is used.


[01/07/2023 3:06 PM] gl#2103
Android app version is 2.0.2215, Ledger app version is 0.03.


[01/07/2023 3:09 PM] gl#2103
I am going to upgrade now the Android app to 2.3.2225 to see if it makes a difference.


[01/07/2023 3:11 PM] glasgowm#9381
@capt_nemo


[01/07/2023 3:18 PM] gl#2103
No difference when using the latest Android app.


[01/08/2023 3:39 AM] shinyumbreon#2454
I always thought using a 25th word creates a different wallet?


[01/08/2023 3:39 AM] shinyumbreon#2454
That‚Äôs how it is for cardano anyways‚Ä¶


[01/08/2023 3:39 AM] shinyumbreon#2454
My 24th and 25th words are 2 different wallets with every app interface I use


[01/08/2023 6:32 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Right.


[01/08/2023 6:26 PM] gl#2103
Of course 25th word creates a different wallet (compared to only using 24 words seed), but it's a base expectation that the *same* seed + same 25th word creates the *same* master secret on any wallets. 

It's like saying that different 24 words create different wallets, sure. But you still expect that if use the same 24 words in Nautilus and in in the Android app then you get access to the same funds.


[01/08/2023 6:27 PM] gl#2103
Point is, if you store your Ergo now on Ledger and you are using a passphrase you won't be able to recover those funds outside of Ledger.


[01/08/2023 6:44 PM] gl#2103
(at least not with the Android Ergo wallet)


[01/09/2023 8:27 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
the reason is that android wallet uses the 25th word as a seedphrase word and in a special way. that's not wrong, but is different than ledger/nautilus treating thr 25th word in a special way. there's no eip for that.


[01/09/2023 10:13 AM] JoeHalton#1855
Any chance that the wallet could work with two different pins to access two different wallets just like a ledger? If someone was doing a $5 attack you could enter a pin that takes you to a dummy wallet?


[01/09/2023 1:53 PM] gl#2103
So to confirm @MrStahlfelge, are you saying that the Android wallet doesn't support "passphrase" in a sense that other wallets do? Passphrase is normally, at least in bitcoin, added as a salt to the PBKDF2 before the master seed is generated. What you are saying suggests that the Android app just treats the 25th word as if it was part of the mnemonic sentence, as opposed to be part of the salt. 

Whether there is an Ergo EIP about this or not I think it's clearly an incompatibility issue. Let's put Ledger aside, you are essentially saying that a Nautilus/SafeW user (for example) cannot recover her wallet using the Android (and I guess iOS?) app and vice versa. 

That cannot be what we want to be the case....?


[01/09/2023 1:54 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yes, a passphrase is not supported and never was. ergo wallet app can only restore wallets from seed phrases. no matter how many words you give as a seed phrase, it is treated as a seed phrase.


[01/09/2023 6:07 PM] gl#2103
Just to confirm what you are saying: are you saying that the Ergo ecosytem in general doesn't support this or your comment is more to the specifics of the mobile wallets you are the author of? 

I am just trying to figure out where the disconnect is here. If Ergo in general doesn't have the notion of a bitcoin like passphrase then we have a serious problem with the Ledger integration...

If Ergo does have this, then then question boils down to whether you are planning to add support to that in the mobile wallets.


[01/09/2023 7:56 PM] cafebedouin#9837
If I'm reading what he said correctly, there is multiple ways to do it, and there is no agreed upon way (an EIP) to handle it.

Anyone know of advantages for embedding a light node in a web extension wallet?

Maybe it would allow the wallet users to submit a transaction directly instead of needing an external node or explorer? Enable SPV? Other stuff?

Personally, I am waiting for ERGO to be available on Ledger in prod mode.


[02/23/2023 10:02 AM] haileypdll#3353
What would be the features provided by that light node ? some additional features compared to a local node ? (I don't really get how a node would fit in a browser and how it would run 24/24 to stay in sync, but the technical performance seems impressive)


[02/23/2023 8:59 PM] soysor#6001
Not sure on features, was asking to see if anyone had ideas

It would be a light node/use nipopows so wouldn't necessarily need to be online 24/7 and would sync quickly

Some things I was thinking about:

- Convenience/easy for non-tech users, most users have a wallet extension, they could also have a light node without needing to run a local node. Would also add more nodes to the network overall
- Security, since the light node could verify transactions independently
- Maybe there could be like a "dnode connector" so dapps could interact with the node in some way üòÇ  - haven't been able to think of any ways this would actually be used though


[02/23/2023 9:00 PM] soysor#6001
mostly just brainstorming if it could actually be useful


[02/23/2023 9:31 PM] cafebedouin#9837
The initial use case for NiPoPoWs, in my view, is getting a wallet that can do Simple Payment Verification (SPV) on a low-end android phone. Android has +80% penetration in low-end phones.


[02/23/2023 9:34 PM] soysor#6001
Yeah SPV is a big use-case

As it relates to browser extension wallets, a light node embedded in browser extensions can provide SPV


[02/23/2023 9:45 PM] glasgowm#9381
Improved security at little cost is the main reason, Nautilus will be able to implement a light SPV wallet once this milestone is done afaik

https://github.com/ergoplatform/sigma-rust/milestone/17

So shouldn't need to re-create the dApp connector

SPV is possible now using the node API, the difference with an embedded light node I guess is more nodes on the network

> So shouldn't need to re-create the dApp connector
I'm not suggesting to recreate a dApp connector, I'm suggesting creating a "light node" connector so dapps can interact with a browser extension light node

What's the logic for a browser extension app on a phone rather than a phone app? I think Nemo prefers browser integration because it doesn't require a centralized server to create translations like in Ergopay. But, I'd worry about having a browser extension on my phone. Seems like an attack vector I'd rather not have...


[02/23/2023 9:57 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Translations=transactions


[02/23/2023 10:02 PM] soysor#6001
Bit of confusion I think, I'm not talking about phones that's a separate thing and would have dedicated phone apps. I'm trying to explore the idea of a node embedded in web extension wallets

>  I think Nemo prefers browser integration because it doesn't require a centralized server to create translations like in Ergopay
It does require a central server to submit transactions though or at least a known node to submit transactions. Embedding a node could potentially remove that need


[02/23/2023 10:14 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I understand, roughly, what a lite wallet with SPV entails. I do not understand how a light node differs from a light wallet. It seems essentially the same thing to me. If you have SPV capabilities, doesn't it imply you have the ability to check transactions and presumably submit transactions directly to the network?


[02/23/2023 10:16 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I may need to learn more about this topic. It is not clear to me.


[02/23/2023 10:21 PM] soysor#6001
I think the difference is in how the capabilities are achieved

The light wallet would need to trust some external node to submit transactions and would perform SPV via API of some external node, wouldn't be participating on the p2p network

Using a light node embedded in the light wallet would remove dependence on external nodes/services, could broadcast the transaction to peers at the p2p level and generally participate in the network for overall security


[02/23/2023 10:34 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Kushti has talked about logarithmic mining and so forth. In my mind, light wallets could also serve as peers, they just might have just identify themselves as a different kind of peer. But, not clear to me how the network topology will work. Maybe it is as you say.


[02/23/2023 10:45 PM] soysor#6001
@capt_nemo any thoughts/ideas/input on above?

Tl;dr could embedding a light node in wallet browser extensions be useful

So, #Cardano will be the 9th #Web3 chain to be supported in the Exodus Web3 Wallet.

What do you want #10 to be?

Ergo has been graining attention here if you want to add some support


[02/25/2023 1:01 AM] capt_nemo#3204
I think it can be useful in so many ways, having the ability to broadcast and check transactions without relying on anything in such limited scenarios is a game changer!

Btw, delivering it as a package like you did, can result in interesting infrastructure tools like decentralized explorers.

Hi guys I‚Äôm looking at zelcore and wondering what my fellow ergonaughts think of it?

I added ergo to my portfolio list but didn‚Äôt get any 12 word key.  Is this a truly non custodial system?


[02/25/2023 9:44 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I haven't heard much good about it. People don't like the UI/UX and backend is janky.

Will it be added to Ledger Live also?

No, that's a separate endeavor which requires a lot more work and maintenance that isn't currently planned.

Any update on when ERGO will be available on Ledger non-dev mode ?


[04/05/2023 8:15 AM] speechsupply#8212
Hi ErgnautNoob here, haven't checked in on my wallet in a while. 
I'm still using Yoroi. Now they inform me, that support for Erg will soon disappear.. 
As of right now, there should be about 700USD worth of Erg there - but the wallet just keeps "loading".. 
Any advice as to how I can move my funds?


[04/05/2023 8:34 AM] JoeHalton#1855
restore your wallet with your seedphrase in a new wallet such as Nautilus or Terminus if on mobile

hi, just had a major problem with SAFEW, i sent 5 ergs out using SAFEW  it charged the 5 ergs + standard fee 0.0011, then it charged another  5.0695 ERG from my account,  or simply stated a double charge, of over 10 erg deducted and now 5.0695 erg are missing. Can someone point me to the team that can look at this issue?


[04/09/2023 6:55 PM] haileypdll#3353
Hi, I'm SAFEW dev. What kind of transaction this was ? What the balance of the transaction was displaying at signing time ? You can see the transaction in the transaction list ? and its balance ?


[04/09/2023 7:06 PM] keven#1768
starting balance was 211.0185  balance after tx was 199.63325256  maybe this will help here is the transaction link https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/6fa459ccc3b72845856b39246a136c00088a194923044b57a05b5bc433a7e7e7


[04/09/2023 7:12 PM] keven#1768
also my safew dose not have a record of the transaction, however I grabbed my phone to take a picture so i have that info. I have also changed the node address 2 times, reloaded , restarted the browser, the wallet still fails to list this transaction, it only shows the previous tx from last month

[04/09/2023 7:37 PM] keven#1768
perhaps this has something to do with it, i created the transaction it asked for my password, I incorrectly typed it, was then asked again, incorrectly inputted the second time, only getting it correct on the third attempt, as i recall.


[04/09/2023 7:55 PM] haileypdll#3353
The transaction displayed in explorer sent 5 erg to 9hEVuK...Sr56eZdBN and 5.0695 erg were returned as change to the sending address.


[04/09/2023 8:08 PM] haileypdll#3353
It seems both the nodes 5.0.7 and 5.0.8 have not integrated this transaction in the balance, neither in the transactions for your address. But the new box (5.0695 ERG) is properly returned in your unspent boxes. So you can spent it.


[04/09/2023 8:13 PM] haileypdll#3353
Node 5.0.8 and explorer shows a 199 erg balance, node 5.0.7 201... no idea what is the issue...


[04/09/2023 8:14 PM] haileypdll#3353
(but you very probably have not lost any ERG üôÇ )


[04/09/2023 8:15 PM] keven#1768
ok, so your saying explorer might normalize and reconcile the balances, maybe push this up to the ergo dev team?


[04/09/2023 8:20 PM] haileypdll#3353
Yes, the node index feature is still new, and you probably faced a bug. Pinging @‚≠êFanta‚≠ê : Hello, maybe you could have a look at this issue ? it seems the node indexes for the balance and the "transaction per address" have somehow not been updated for https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/6fa459ccc3b72845856b39246a136c00088a194923044b57a05b5bc433a7e7e7.


[04/09/2023 8:24 PM] ‚≠êFanta‚≠ê#0315
fixed in 5.0.8, but token tracking is still broken


[04/09/2023 8:50 PM] haileypdll#3353
Hmm, with 5.0.8 the transaction does not appears in the list of transaction for this address. (nor with 5.0.7)


[04/09/2023 9:21 PM] ‚≠êFanta‚≠ê#0315
What does /blockchain/indexedHeight return?


[04/10/2023 8:08 AM] haileypdll#3353
currently it returns: 
{
  "indexedHeight": 979262,
  "fullHeight": 979262
}
but the transaction is not shown in the transactions by addresses.


[04/12/2023 12:52 AM] ‚≠êFanta‚≠ê#0315
found the bug
after I refactored the segment retrieval code I forgot a ".reverse"
fixed in indexer PR

Hi guys. Just trying to wrap my head around Ledger and the token limit. 
Would it be possible to attack a Ledger address by sending it loads of different rubbish tokens repeatedly across multiple transactions?
You'd be creating new boxes with some dust ERGs there yes, and that may leave the wallet holder stuck having to restore to a hot wallet to send anything?
