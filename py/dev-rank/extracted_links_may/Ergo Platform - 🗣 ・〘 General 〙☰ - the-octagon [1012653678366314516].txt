@anetaBTC Few questions if you don't mind.

1. Is the team participating in this vote with their tokens? If so how much voting power do they represent?

2. Why is this happening? Was the original amount you set aside for development not sufficient?

The NEW 4 year Cycle
I believe a new Four Year Cycle has started.  But I do not have confirmation of it. And that's OK! In this video, I describe why that it is.  

As investors, we're looking to gain allocation at the right times, and to reduce allocation at the right times. With the benefit of hindsight, I believe this will end up as one of those times.

Ergonauts, I really feel like AnetaBTC needs to be held accountable  for their BS vote to utilize funds from what they described as community treasury. they are pushing for  a public  vote to utilize what was designated for community profit to be used for a slow as F development team that is reliant on others development to produce a product they themselves cannot  produce, if I am wrong please show me why I am wrong, I just believe they are going to be a black eye in our ecosystem if they are not challenged to do better, Fuck the shenanigans! Think critically and if a project like Aneta start's to slow rug the Ergo community then it should be exposed!
I am fully doxxed and involved in a project, I expect to be held accountable for my actions - all other projects should be held accountable too - I suggest pushing them out of ergo tbh, and I like frosty, but when I weigh the situation that project has pushed on Ergo contributors, I think: fuck frosty, his proposed vote is literally an embarrassment to what our community is about.

 i was thinking earlier about how someone should set up a wallet for a "no" vote on their proposal since they're using voting tokens where people send them to a wallet for their "yes, lesser amount" and "yes, higher amount" vote that they're doing


[01/12/2023 6:57 AM] crandano#0000
i don't really want to get involved, but there have been a lot of questions over the months. i really hope it isn't a slow rug.
 i'm not a fan of the "yes/yes" vote.
as far as i'm aware there wasn't a discussion with their community beforehand either unless i'm mistaken

what do you guys think the next step should be? is this a slow rug or are they building something and just utilizing all the tools that have already been built? i wonder what the Cardano side looks like. i'm not understanding the point if they're utilizing Rosen eventually

has anyone talked to Frosty directly about concerns?

[01/12/2023 8:22 AM] koutelier#0000
Took fake Ilya two hours to develop it and I know frosty asked him to use it and add fees. They basically milking the community for over a year with zero proofs of development. When they first called them out they gave zero proofs and the answers wasn‚Äôt even serious.


[01/12/2023 9:15 AM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
Here is one way to set a framework. Not only for aneta, but all projects.

1. Get DIDs for active community members.
2. Discuss and list best practices that you expect from projects.
3. Evaluate by voting based on the above list.
4. Publish the results, and use as a reference. Discourage, thrash talk, do not invest, socially exclude projects that score poorly.

Pseudonymous DID would help in making transparent evaluation without reputational cost or burning bridges.


[01/12/2023 9:21 AM] Gazza_SP#0000
I don't think ergo can just push them out to be honest, people need to vote with their wallets, do their research and sell if they believe there to be issues. No harm asking these questions of the team though publicly as this will be seen by the investors.

 Yes. That is true for an open blockchain.

The above is just to support that action by setting standards and a evaluation reference for the public.

 I think we could develop a rubric or checklist of points that indicate a legitimate project. Then maybe issue an nft that signals their 'score' or 'grade' according to our evaluation. I heard of a 'soul bound token' that can't be traded, which would make the stamp permanent. A date in the metadata could give people perspective and allow us to overwrite if someone turns shady. I like your points so far, my ideas include:

Founder / team identity is important. Even if they are anon or pseudonymous, there can be a system in place for this. 
Verifying the level of open source and maybe confirming an audit if there was one. If this became popular, perhaps we could offer an audit(I don't know who would do this, just not me. I don't know shit)
Fair token allocation and confirming that what they claim is true. 
Evaluate tokenomics and look for signs of ponzi. 
Evaluate use cases
Evaluate the level of decentralization
Do users lose custody of their funds? (trustlessness)
Can users interact privately?
Is it easy enough for average people to use?


[01/12/2023 4:34 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Then maybe we have a dashboard or something that tracks all the tokens we sent out and associates them with their projects / founders so people can look things up easily.

 Good point about anon, pseudonymous reputation and doxxed reputation.

Full anon is 0 trust and should be fully OS. Reputation can give some leeway, but maybe not as much as 1/1 multisig into community fund.


[01/12/2023 4:45 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Maybe part of the process could be a zoom interview that gets recorded and stored on the dashboard


[01/12/2023 4:48 PM] crandano#0000
You‚Äôd need a proper dev with time on their hands to deep dive and evaluate projects. Also tough to recommend or not recommend projects. Gets into the territory where if someone gets an ‚Äòapproval‚Äô and they rug or something goes bad that would be awful.

(re @TIMRŒ£G7 : *I also really like rekt.news, so maybe a postmortem blog for projects acting shady around the space*) 
 
 Rekt is also accused of taking sides. Thats why any profiting or permanent team is not perfect. 

Especially when evaluating decentralization of other projects, I think the fundament of this service should be decentralized.

Then again, rekt is still much better than nothing. The non-profit decentralization maxi rating service would not be as good quality or maintained reliably.

Yes I agree with both of you. This should not be any recommendation, just an objective evaluation that helps people make up their own minds

 Good point. Some of TIMRŒ£G7 suggestions go quite far on the subjective side.

Things like OS or not? Doxxed or not? Decentralized voting?  can be more objective.


[01/12/2023 4:53 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Yeah I would want to make the tool as objective as possible. Some of them might be tricky, but we can just create definitions of things ahead of time and ask if they fit the definition or not. Ponzi for example

 Look how many are openly criticising aneta. Probably even more would do it if there was no rep concerns.

There might just be enough active community members who care about this.

Aneta was my first thought. We could have raised a flag sooner

I'm wondering about members now. How do you decide who participates? Is it best to have 3rd party only? or invite trusted community members? or include everyone? only invite people after they have launched a successful project?

 ErgoNation has the framework for the decentralized foundation, but it is more work and cumbersome to enter.

Picking people is much easier, but inevitably includes centralized gatekeeping.

I think ErgoNation with the choice of anonymity can scale, better at least. Not requiring mixed funds and a clean wallet. It‚Äôs up to users to maintain their own anonymity. It‚Äôs difficult to scale mandatory anonymity.

If, yes. Also depends on how much the price will increase just after IDO of course. Hard to tell, because there should be quite big interest since it‚Äôs one of the ‚Äúbest‚Äù and already established projects so far having an presale on ergopad, on the other hand the valuation with 12c is already quite high, and as per nature of being  a farming and reward token the price will probably decrease long term.

2. Project delivery and success of the proposal is in question because people oversell and under deliver @ncerovac @w00tcake
3. Trouble with operation because of extra pay, growing too fast, - @ncerovac 
4. Painful and Unrewarding - @Matthew_Graham
5. Whales have a lot of power and influence despite antiwhale mechanics - and if things dont go their way, they dont vote. Plebs have little to no say - feeds into #4 @Swader 
6. Plebs only participate in airdrops @jayhay  (probably because of #4 and 5) 
7. People dont understand the proposals even when making key infrastructure (?) @jayhay

 I was surprised they were releasing a token. I guess idk why so many things need tokens


[02/03/2023 5:12 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Just read the white paper. I like the idea of a community owned protocol but I'm interested to see how it's implemented.


[02/03/2023 5:12 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
All the fuss w Aneta makes me skeptical

 funding


[02/03/2023 5:13 AM] NoahErgo#0000
answer is almost always funding


[02/03/2023 5:17 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I get it. Im wondering when it would be worth just owning the protocol and living off fees. Seems like better long term


[02/03/2023 5:18 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Also seems easier to manage. How does this community voting happen? And how is it executed?


[02/03/2023 5:20 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Say a change gets voted on... Then it's up to the owners to execute? Are keys distributed?

 The fees on ergo are way too low, no project could survive off them üòÖ


[02/03/2023 9:40 AM] Gstoiti#0000
(re @Gazza_SP : *The fees on ergo are way too low, no project could survive off them üòÖ*) 
 
 But if funding from token sale > development costs > expected profit from fees, then why should anyone buy the token? 

So either devs are "scamming" investors (case above), or expected profit > development costs, but they need immediate liquidity and hence have to sell tokens, or they don't want to carry the risk alone and sell tokens to share the risk.


[02/03/2023 9:43 AM] Gazza_SP#0000
The issue is more of a case that we are all expecting ergo to gain some mass adoption in time, it just hasn't happened yet, but we all think it has the potential, we are as hopeful as erg investors are by choosing to build in the ecosystem


[02/03/2023 9:44 AM] Gazza_SP#0000
The other side of it is if we don't all build in the ecosystem, it may never reach mass adoption


[02/03/2023 9:44 AM] Gazza_SP#0000
Tough situation overall


[02/03/2023 9:47 AM] Gstoiti#0000

 Yeah, so it's probably risk sharing.


[02/03/2023 9:49 AM] Gazza_SP#0000
Unfortunately I think, it's a bit of a catch 22, ergo exploding means all dapp builders will be successful, without the current dapp builders it's unlikely ergo will ever explode üòÖ

(re @Gazza_SP : *Unfortunately I think, it's a bit of a catch 22, ergo exploding means all dapp builders will be successful, without the current dapp builders it's unlikely ergo will ever explode üòÖ*) 
 
 Although some people dislike the connection to Cardano, building on both chains (basically subsidizing Ergo development with Cardano profits) might be the best way out of this situation.


[02/03/2023 9:53 AM] Gazza_SP#0000
(re @Gstoiti : *Although some people dislike the connection to Cardano, building on both chains (basically subsidizing Ergo development with Cardano profits) might be the best way out of this situation.*) 
 
 It's definitely a way to get some much needed liquidity, ergo feels dried up at this point, so many IDOs but not enough funds to go around. Also I think most ergo projects will provide what cardano is missing, open source and decentralized projects


[02/03/2023 9:54 AM] Gstoiti#0000
Yeah, in the end it might be a win-win situation for both, Ergo and Cardano, although at the beginning both sides might feel different.


[02/03/2023 2:24 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
(re @Gazza_SP : *The fees on ergo are way too low, no project could survive off them üòÖ*) 
 
 I was imagining a protocol fee. Maybe a base fee of some small % of txns. Like the mixer or AH.


[02/03/2023 2:24 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Risk sharing makes sense tho


[02/03/2023 2:26 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
(re @TIMRŒ£G7 : *I was imagining a protocol fee. Maybe a base fee of some small % of txns. Like the mixer or AH.*) 
 
 The issue there is if we introduce the fee needed for us to actually survive it would be pretty huge and then someone can just clone all our open source code and build a free competetor üòÇ


[02/03/2023 2:28 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Also, the issue for a dex, from what I understand, is tokens on your dex cannot be listed with major tracking services unless the dex itself has a token.


[02/03/2023 2:29 PM] Gstoiti#0000
(re  : *<cafebedouin> Also, the issue for a dex, from what I understand, is tokens on your dex cannot be listed with major tracking services unless the dex itself has a token.*)

 I see. You need proper incentives on both sides. And the 3rd party


[02/03/2023 2:30 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Exactly how tokenjay works for escrow, the SigUSD contract, I think V3 of the Auction House, skyharbor, and probably others.


[02/03/2023 2:31 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I don't know, but it is something Marty from Ergopad has said (I believe) when asked about tokens being listed on cexes.

(re  : *<cafebedouin> Exactly how tokenjay works for escrow, the SigUSD contract, I think V3 of the Auction House, skyharbor, and probably others.*) 
 
 Hedging risk seems to be the best answer here. It's going to come down to paideia making that workable or not.


[02/03/2023 2:47 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Maybe I'm also skeptical of governance for financial products. In theory it would make the protocol better, but voters are probably less informed and more profit oriented than the creator.


[02/03/2023 2:53 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Another, not insignificant, problem people don't vote, often because they don't feel they know enough or don't want the responsibility of making that particular decision.


[02/03/2023 2:55 PM] Luivatra#0000
that is where optimistic governance comes in, only few trusted individuals (the team?) can make proposals, if noone votes against it passes, if people vote against it comes down to a standard vote

You can use Ergo Mobile Wallet with Spectrum and Ergopad.

Foe Duckpools and Sigmafi, probably best to use Nautilus.


[02/07/2023 4:37 PM] NoahErgo#0000
What would you all consider a healthy enough level of collateralization to consider lending to a loan request on sigmafi


[02/07/2023 4:43 PM] Luivatra#0000
kinda depends on the collateral used, is it something volatile or stable?


[02/07/2023 4:44 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Lets say one with erg and another with sigusd


[02/07/2023 4:44 PM] NoahErgo#0000
also depends on the lendt asset too tho i suppose


[02/07/2023 4:44 PM] NoahErgo#0000
2 100 erg loans, one with erg collateral and another with sigusd collateral


[02/07/2023 4:45 PM] Luivatra#0000
I dont really get the erg for erg loan, but there a collateral of 100% would be fine I guess üòÖ


[02/07/2023 4:46 PM] NoahErgo#0000
lol yeah thats true


[02/07/2023 4:46 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Ignore that


[02/07/2023 4:46 PM] Luivatra#0000
guess for the other case time also plays a factor


[02/07/2023 4:47 PM] NoahErgo#0000
i imagine interest offered will play a factor as well even if it shouldnt


[02/07/2023 4:47 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Somebody could put up a loan request for 100 erg, 20 erg interest and offer 80 erg as collateral


[02/07/2023 4:48 PM] NoahErgo#0000
red flag


[02/07/2023 5:24 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Understanding SigRSV is child's play compared to Sigmafi loans. As just one example, let's imagine I'd like to put up a stake key with 1 million paideia tokens in it as collateral. How much Erg should I ask for it? Answer depends on how much time and even then, probably lender would only want to do 1/10 of the value? Now imagine a million SigRSV, a stake key of 1 million Ergopad, or 1 million AHT. I think I'd lend no more than 1/10 of what these assets are currently worth. But, we will find out. Nemo probably should have an activity page that shows what is funded, so people learn what the market can support.

(re @NoahErgo : *seems that some mousepad company has created a dao on paideia LOL*) 
 
 Hi Noah,

Yes very interested in the crypto space. Only looking at the dao for helping facilitate discussion between internal team for now. Give everyone a fair equal vote and say on behind the scenes decisions. Distribute equity down the road etc. 

Do you have some experience in this space? 

Kind regards,

got to remember that rosen might not be perfect right off the bat, the risk assumptions are more clear so if it doesnt work out well, easier to see where it went wrong and build off of that

Also, I have had many convos with these non-English speaking accounts he mentions. Always in English...You would think at least once he would mention that it was him I was talking to rather than act like it was the "founder"

Odd take ... perhaps its early and I'm misreading the LOL at the end... but don't we want real world companies using ERGO? Not stating this will move the needle, but it gives more people an experience with ERGO that probably wouldn't have had it before?
Appreciate you reaching out to them -- see the later post, so you are being proactive and that is cool --- but Paideia is how all startups and small biz that have ESOP or other profit sharing could utilize ERGO features.
All supply chain companies and vertical manufacturers could use Palmyra Comdex when it is ready for use beyond it's initial use case. Traceability is a big thing for ISO companies and this is another tool that may aid in that quest/need.
Anyway... thanks for following up with Spyre, but the initial take just seemed odd to me.

This looks like a fun way to experiment with autctions. I think they might hold a key for getting rid of oracles (in stablecoins especially).

        How does this help remove oracles?


[04/12/2023 5:25 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Just a guess:

Oracles are one source for a market price, auctions (which are a form of market) are another one. Problem is that one can't auction stuff for which one typically needs oracles in a decentralized way on chain, because they are off chain. But maybe one can use auctions in some interesting new protocols to create, for example, some sort of stable value.


[04/12/2023 6:35 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
(re @Gstoiti : *Just a guess:

        Yes.

Auction gives market price.

Not so frequent, but it could remove oracle, which is an external dependency.

So auction might enable a more resilient stablecoin design.


[04/12/2023 6:36 PM] Luivatra#0000
how though? wouldnt it be easy to manipulate? bid high -> "oracle value" way too high

Would be fun to mix that somehow with the "hash power / erg emission" stablecoin idea.

(re @LuivatraEP : *how though? wouldnt it be easy to manipulate? ...*)
        
        If somebody bids at high price, that is market price, no?

(re @LuivatraEP : *how though? wouldnt it be easy to manipulate? ...*)
        
        I am thinking limits on mint and redeem depending on auction volume.

That is a big caveat conpared to sigusd, where full supply is immediately redeemable, but the parameter could be set in a way, that makes manipulation unprofitable


[04/12/2023 7:21 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
Spitballing here for example,

Every epoch, people can sell and buy 1% of circulating StableCoin (SC) supply by auction.

If people only want to sell SC, then the lowest prices are served using erg from Protocol Reserves (PR). 

If people only want to buy SC, then the highest prices are served by minting SC and putting the paid erg into PR.

If there are both, sellers and buyers, then more than 1% could be exchanged. For ecample, 5% of circ. supply is looking to sell at 100 SC per erg, and 5% of circ supply is looking to buy at 90 SC per erg. Now, the protocol could match those bids, and serve them at offered prices. The protocol could pocket the 10 price difference into PR, to accumulate reserves for higher stability guarantee.

I would still add a separate AMM into the mix, like in dexy, and use a part of PR to provide liquidity in the pair. The trade fees are probably required in addition to the auction mechanism to accumulate reserves.
