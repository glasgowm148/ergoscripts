This version includes a lot of new features including:
    - Covet address
    - Tor support
    - Multiple node request distribution
    - Backup/restore functionalities
    - Data pruning for old finished mixes
    - UI/UX improvements
    - Backward compatibility from now on
    - Security bug fix (not exploited ever; related post will be released)

Also, starting from this version, ErgoMixer will be backward compatible; Meaning you won‚Äôt have to remove the mixer‚Äôs database and finish your mixes in order to start using a new version in the future.

Using ErgoMixer v2, more than 56,000 ERG mixed successfully. Therefore, there are more than 110,000 ERG being mixed till now using the ErgoMixer.

IMPORTANT: Please consider finishing your mixes by Monday and start using the new version.

A **"covert address"** is an entry point to a mix. Any received erg/token on this address will automatically mixed after reaching a predefined threshold and can be withdrawn to any address later.


[10/04/2020 3:04 PM] anon2020s#6116
ErgoMixer donation address is the first ever covert address:

Any funds received at this address will be accumulated till it reaches ~252 ERG (about 2 ERG for fees). Then the mix starts automatically for 180 rounds and the final box of 250 ERG can be withdrawn to any address later (it can be set at the time of address creation or any time after).
Here, we used the 250 ERG ring (1, 10, 100, and 250 rings are available) and set the mixing level to 180 rounds (30, 60, 90, and 180 rounds are supported). 
So you can use a covert address as your regular address for receiving funds (ERG and tokens) and no one would be able to distinguish your final receiving point.

@anon2020s in the Mixer 2.0, mixes with funds not being withdrawn but all the mixes being completed moved from active to history. Should be active I guess ?

@kushti Already done in v3.0.

@anon2020s no manual mixes anymore ?

@kushti In Active Mixes, you can have specified mixes like before.


[10/07/2020 10:50 AM] anon_real#2768
It seems to be different than before though

@anon_real yes. there are some UI changes like this one


[10/07/2020 10:51 AM] anon_real#2768
@anon2020s But I can't see my active covert mixes in Active Mixes page


[10/07/2020 10:52 AM] kushti#0978

[10/07/2020 10:52 AM] anon2020s#6116
> @anon2020s But I can't see my active covert mixes in Active Mixes page
@anon_real since they are permanent mixes, they are in the covert address page and have their own history for each address


[10/07/2020 10:57 AM] anon2020s#6116
after creating a covert address, check the ALL ASSETS setting of that address. there you can set the RINGS.


[10/07/2020 10:58 AM] anon2020s#6116
please note that the 1 ERG Ring has a relatively high cost.


[10/07/2020 11:00 AM] kushti#0978
yes, so maybe default choice should be different ?


[10/07/2020 11:02 AM] anon2020s#6116
> yes, so maybe default choice should be different ?
@kushti I'll consider that if it is an issue to most of the users. btw, this setting can be changed by the user at any moment


[10/07/2020 11:56 AM] kushti#0978
@anon2020s I've changed the ring but it seems old one is still being used ?


[10/07/2020 12:15 PM] anon2020a#8187
@kushti It will take effect for new deposits. In your case I'm seeing that your deposit was distributed for 1 ERG ring already.
Everytime it detects some deposites, it distributes them based on the ring in that moment.


[10/07/2020 1:02 PM] kushti#0978
@anon2020a good, thanks! Hopefully, will get more donations )


[10/07/2020 2:01 PM] scalahub#2618
so what is a covert address? Is it different from stealth address? if so what is the script in it?


[10/07/2020 2:02 PM] kushti#0978
@scalahub ordinary P2PK address I guess, but behind it there's a mixer working

Explorer backend is down. We are fixing it. Summary will be later.


[11/01/2020 3:41 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
Actually explorer backend is up and running. While one of two explorer nodes is re-syncing another one handles all the traffic, so some requests may timeout. Everything should be back to normal within 2 hours. We will draw conclusions about this situation.

good news for magnum wallet users!
ErgoMixer will support your current magnum wallet's addresses. Your current ERG addresses will be imported into mixer and converted into covert addresses. so you can keep using your previous addresses, however as covert addresses.

only thing I don't have is teh firs node address conneted - the other 3 are no problem


[02/06/2021 5:19 AM] D4.#9289
so is it possible to have all the mix batches go to a single address I create in the Yoroi wallet?

I believe that is no problem.


[02/06/2021 6:31 AM] anon_real#2768

[02/06/2021 2:40 PM] D4.#9289
and you can send to a single address multiple times?

hey @anon_real @kushti you there?


[02/07/2021 1:51 AM] D4.#9289
so I started the process and all of them are running - is the next step to click the 'withdraw now' and set the address?


[02/07/2021 1:52 AM] D4.#9289
I see my balance has gone down signifantly on the ergo explorer - why is that? That's part of the mixing?


[02/07/2021 6:06 AM] anon_real#2768
Yes, don't worry about it. Your funds are in mixing boxes.


[02/07/2021 6:07 AM] anon_real#2768
Yes, whenever you want, you can set address and withdraw them.


[02/07/2021 4:26 PM] D4.#9289

it's been almost 12 hours and still running


[02/07/2021 4:30 PM] anon_real#2768
@D4. You don't need to wait for it to be finished. Withdraw them when you like.
And yes, the computer that the mixer is running on should be on.

[02/08/2021 3:51 AM] D4.#9289

[02/08/2021 6:58 AM] anon_real#2768
Yes, mixing is not a very fast process. Also, currently there are some issues with block intervals which will be solved in the next epoch. So yeah, it is slow.


[02/08/2021 12:20 PM] kushti#0978
@D4. blocks are coming slow now, and also no active counterparties (due to block times as well I guess). You can withdraw ergs now btw.

You are done for now, it takes a few minutes to create mixing boxes. You can check them in history.
Anytime after you can withdraw your boxes


[02/08/2021 9:36 PM] anon2020s#6116
It takes more than usual because of fork


[02/08/2021 9:37 PM] xfly (œÉ, œÉ)#5520
ok


[02/08/2021 9:37 PM] xfly (œÉ, œÉ)#5520
so i will get 1000 erg? the 86 aren't possible to withdraw?


[02/08/2021 9:38 PM] anon2020s#6116
About 80 erg will be stuck in this address, after withdrawing to yoroi send pending deposit amount to the shown address to free them


[02/08/2021 9:39 PM] xfly (œÉ, œÉ)#5520
and then i can withdraw 160 back to yoroi


[02/08/2021 9:39 PM] xfly (œÉ, œÉ)#5520
?


[02/08/2021 9:41 PM] anon2020s#6116
You can withdraw them all, but in 250 erg chunks. So first withdraw the first 1000, then redeposit to this address to create a new 250 erg box and finally withdraw them all


[02/08/2021 9:41 PM] xfly (œÉ, œÉ)#5520
perfect

If using the latest mixer, it‚Äôs a matter of time. Just wait. Network is very slow these days due to hard fork. 
If mixer v3.1, send a bit more, like 0.0015 for the very fist tx creation


[02/13/2021 11:10 AM] glasgowm#9381
could you elaborate on this `- integrating AgeUSD with mixer (mixing is already supported), i.e. buying stable and RC coins directly from the mixer, eliminating the need for any wallet in between`

Will this purchase RC/SC from the sigmaUSD instance being set up?

would be neat if there were more high privacy assumptions made in automating things like setting up withdrawal address(once wallet relationship established)  and amount of mixing rounds etc - three would greatly improve the user experience - privacy shouldn‚Äôt be a burden

Provide incentive to create half-mix boxes in ErgoMixer
The usability of ergomixer is dependent on the existence of half-mix boxes.  However, creating such boxes has the effect of waiting till someone uses such boxes.  In order to provide incentive to create half-mix boxes, we can use the idea of ‚Äústealth addresses‚Äù by @kushti  Recall that both half-mix box and stealth address rely on some g^x for se...

Congrats to @anon_real and others for successfully deploying SigmaUSD.
From now on, you can MIX your SigUSD and SigRSV coins. 
It may take a few minutes till your mixer recognizes the support. 
No update needed. Just relaunch your mixer.

My random thought.  SigmaUSD is currently the only mixable stablecoin I am aware of.  Most mixers have some time element involved. SigmaUSD offers the ability to prevent loss of market value in the underlying asset during mixing.  I think there is value/utility, in the ability to mix stable value. Not to mention the value is backed 4/8 by a rese...

for a minute forget about the stuck amount in the covert address.
go to history, set your yoroi address(s) and withdraw all boxes to yoroi.
after a few minutes, when the funds appear in yoroi, 
go back to your covert address; there are two amounts: deposited and pending deposit.
send exactly the amount shown as "pending deposit", no more no less.
wait a few minutes.
go to history
set your yoroi address again and withdraw the box.
done.

history will be pruned after withdrawal being confirmed 720 times, unless you change it in the config file. So don't worry. The mixed boxes are withdrawn to your yoroi(? or any withdraw address you have set). go to that wallet and send the "pending deposit" amount to the covert address.
for example, if you send 9.414 Erg to "Lupeergo" address 9gCTeR... (in the picture see your mouse over that address), a new box mix box will be created, which can be withdrawn again to your yoroi wallet.

BTW, GraalVM is not strictly necessary to run Appkit. It is rather possibility than a requirement. Unless you really use Graal features like running JavaScript etc.


[03/29/2021 10:55 AM] glasgowm#9381
Oh cool, thanks. Probably leave that out then for the basic install? Why would you want to run JS with graal/the mixer anyway?


[03/30/2021 9:58 AM] morphic#4133
1) You may for some reason like JS and want to develop Ergo dApps using Node.js, then you can use Appkit from Node.js. 
2) Or you have existing Node.js backend application and want it to seamlessly integrate with Ergo from the same Node.js process. Then you can run your entire Node.js under GraalVM (which is fully supported by the Graal team) and then just use Appkit from your legacy code directly
3) You may have other use cases with other language in similar ways. I did some experiments here https://github.com/aslesarenko/ergo-appkit-examples

Ty @morphic - I've just turned it off in the script for now but will have a read into it. Seems that'd be more if you were a dev who wanted to integrate the mixer into something?


[03/31/2021 9:11 AM] glasgowm#9381
Not sure how easy this would be @anon2020s - but could you generate a covert address that automatically converts into SigUSD?


[03/31/2021 9:12 AM] glasgowm#9381
So whenever erg are sent to that address, it buys SigUSD and mixes it


[03/31/2021 11:50 AM] anon2020s#6116

@Dergler I'm getting the same behavior, and it's been over an hour and mixing still has not completed. This could certainly be user error on my part as this is the first time I'm using the mixer.

[04/11/2021 9:24 PM] Dergler#0451
yea it's pretty slow running in windows. I wonder if there is a better config to run this or if it's limited by hardware. would be nice to have an expectation on how much time a mix would take, or maybe even just a general speed tips. when I'm only using it to try and get RSV this is pretty inconvenient.

Mixing process does not depend on your OS, hardware, ...
It only depends on the other people's activity. If there are enough people mixing their coins at the time you are mixing, the process will not take long. Also consider that delays will benefit your privacy gains.

Issue with SigTokens looks to be the same as what sigmausd.io has right now, and I do not know what it is. There is some issues in the WASM we are using.

[04/13/2021 10:02 AM] anon2020s#6116
our computation is different from sigmausd.io but we use their WASM.
the difference is, in sigmausd, you say how many USD/RSV you want to mint and it gives you the required amount in ERG.
in mixer, you say how many ERG you have to be used for minting, we calculate how much USD/RSV can be minted with that amount of ERG. a tiny amount of ERG will be remain unused, which will be sent to the withdraw address as well.

I tested mixer with it and mixer works well. I will not update the explorer to the latest version. So, you can use it instead of the explorer right now, till the issue is addressed.

Can anyone help me get the Mixer working on Ubuntu 20.04? I get an error when running the .jar file. I've tried running the install script and I also tried compiling the .jar myself


[04/26/2021 2:31 PM] anon2020s#6116
May we go through it step by step? let's see what's the error when running the jar file first

this error is not important, it's about the tray icon.
it happens when the host does not have any GUI or it's interface is not compatible with ours. 
You can ignore it.

it depends on your ubuntu GUI.
anyway, if you receive this error on Ubuntu with GUI, you can try to build yourself. In most cases, the tray icon may work this way

[04/29/2021 2:04 PM] Dergler#0451
Something like this is hard to do on Ergo, right? the ergomixer is non-custodial, so that risk is eliminated, non-interactive, so humans aren't doing the mixing, and communication is done through Tor. as long as you also practice good info sec you should be in great shape? I swear there needs to be a guide on this.


[04/29/2021 2:04 PM] Dergler#0451

Less people mixing in 1 ERG ring. You cannot speed up by adding to the running mixer. But, running another mixer will help.

hey team, i am new here, big fan of the project. wanted to share an anecdote about using another mixer recently in case its helpful.


[05/05/2021 1:25 AM] Kaven#6681
so the contracts for the mixer were all audited and sound, working well. the frontend however did not anticipate a case where a user might have javascript turned off. the contract happily received the funds and the withdrawal key was never issued. the funds were unrecoverable.


[05/05/2021 1:27 AM] Kaven#6681

You can have multiple addresses on the node (I believe) - you can do covert addresses on the mixer

[05/22/2021 7:06 PM] nitram147#5106
Great, are they are all made at once and then sent to some ergo relay? If so, then all of the new UTxOs will be created and spent int the same block (in case miner will include all constructed transactions into single block). Wouldn't that be suspicious looking? üôÇ


[05/22/2021 7:13 PM] anon_real#2768
That is correct, txs will probably end up in the same block. It is not perfect but when someone is auditing your wallet (by looking into an address that knows is yours) will have a much harder time to tell that you've received funds from the mixer.


[05/22/2021 7:16 PM] anon_real#2768
Anyway, it is easy to wait some random time between each tx but that is not convenient imo since will take some time.


[05/22/2021 7:21 PM] nitram147#5106

@anon2020s I asked in the development thread on how I could contribute to the Ergo project and @glasgowm suggested I could help with the ErgoMixer landing page. If you are interested Id be happy to try put something together for you depending on how quick you need something up. If you could guide me on what you are envisioning it would really help me get started.  You can DM me if you want.

the staking protocol is rather different for mixer. it's part of holding mixer tokens and gaining the shared profit by staking your tokens. So, first of all you should buy mixer tokens and then stake them to gain profit.


[05/26/2021 12:10 PM] glasgowm#9381
do you have a rough timeline for when tokenisation will be up and running? Q2-4? 2022?


[05/26/2021 12:18 PM] anon2020s#6116
I'm working on the contracts and the roadmap. My estimation is tokenisation will be up in the next 2 months. Token sale might occur sooner.

A solution for staking
This topic proposes a solution for staking, which is not relying on data inputs and also scalable (can support thousands of tokens).  We consider the case of ErgoMixer, with profit from the mixer to be collected in a box associated with some ‚Äúfunding NFT‚Äù first. Then payments done periodically, in epochs (say, 1 epoch = 1,024 blocks). Epoch numb...

I lack the minimum number of brain cells to understand :D


[05/27/2021 11:36 AM] glasgowm#9381
It's a solution that allows you to 'stake' your ergs, and earn passive income by providing liquidity to the mixer. This would also improve the privacy level of the mixer itself.

Ah so it's basically yield farming like with other defi platforms? I thought the term 'staking' was restricted to discussions of Proof of Stake


[05/27/2021 2:52 PM] glasgowm#9381
staking is when you help secure a blockchain network by improving its safety and yield farming usually has impermanent loss afaik


[05/29/2021 10:22 AM] Gazza_SP#5835
Thanks for the reply, my main question now is what is the relationship between erg tokens and the new mixer tokens? Can they be swapped somehow? Maybe on the DEX?


[05/29/2021 2:39 PM] glasgowm#9381
It sounds like just a way to tie a smart-contract to the erg I don't think the tokens themselves are significant

will the ergomixer be available on the cardano blockchaing?


[06/01/2021 11:58 AM] Platypus#2410
No it won't be directly deployed I think, but you might be able to mint wrapped ADA on the ERGO blockchain, mix those, and then port it back over?


[06/01/2021 11:59 AM] Platypus#2410
Also, the extended UTxO could enable direct ADA mixing too i reckon?


[06/01/2021 2:48 PM] nitram147#5106
If there would be enough cryptographic primitives built in plutus language, I don't see a point why somebody couldn't rewrite it and deploy it on the cardano network


[06/01/2021 2:49 PM] nitram147#5106
In case they are not there, they can be programmed inside the smartcontract (plutus should be turing complete), but it can result in really long code which will be expensive to run


[06/03/2021 1:39 AM] mconstant#4986
There‚Äôs also Marlowe. What about that?


[06/16/2021 8:24 PM] glasgowm#9381
How is this different from tornado.cash @anon2020s ? they also seem to be advertising as non-custodial and non-interactive at a quick google


[06/17/2021 11:31 AM] nitram147#5106
One difference I know about, is that Tornado.Cash is using zk-SNARKs. It means that there had to be a "ceremony" for generation of parameters required by the zk-SNARKs algorithm itself. This used to be done in a Multi-party-computation way so it's enough if only one participant of the MPC setup was honest, all others can try to cheat and it will be secure anyway. However if all of the participant cheated and cooperate they will have the ability to generate fake proofs later and nobody will know about it.


[06/17/2021 11:32 AM] nitram147#5106
In the specific case of tornado cash it would mean that if all of the 1114 ceremony setup participants cheated (number of participant is available here https://tornado.cash/), they could generate fake proofs and drain money from the tornado.cash smartcontract.


[06/17/2021 11:33 AM] nitram147#5106
However if only one of them was honest, then it's secure for people to use.


[06/17/2021 11:34 AM] nitram147#5106
ErgoMixer don't require this "ceremony" setup, so in this way it's better than tornado.cash üôÇ

Hey everyone, I‚Äôm new to Ergo. I was playing with the mixer and saw that by default the mixer connects to a few remote nodes, over http it appears. I tried setting the config so that it connects to my local node on localhost but somehow the mixer cannot start due to some accessibility issue with the node. Does anyone know what I‚Äôm doing wrong? I tried to look up on github but haven‚Äôt found anything related yet

I mean without ergo mixer on my local machine


[07/05/2021 5:16 PM] glasgowm#9381
This isn't a true mixer, it just hops it through a bunch of addresses to obfuscate it. It's still traceable this way but removes the obvious mixer withdrawal record on your wallet


[07/05/2021 5:55 PM] alisovsky#6009
There is a way find out how many fee I will pay for that?


[07/08/2021 12:59 AM] Kaven#6681
if you run the mixer on the same machine as a node, should/could you just put your local node as the only element of the nodes array


[07/08/2021 3:11 PM] glasgowm#9381
I imagine that'd make it less private


[07/08/2021 3:12 PM] glasgowm#9381
@anon2020s anyway to redeem all tokens? still stuck


[07/08/2021 3:23 PM] Kaven#6681
that had not occurred to me. a doc on maximizing privacy gains would be helpful. following the steps is tricky enough for the user, let alone knowing whats happening under the hood and how to leverage that for maximum privacy gains.


[07/08/2021 3:24 PM] Kaven#6681
i'm also not confident about hard coded ip addresses, is there a discovery mechanism i can use dynamically for this?


[07/08/2021 5:24 PM] Kaven#6681
thinking about this more, it would be concerning to me if privacy depended on a small handful of nodes. when is privacy achieved? 2 nodes? 4? 10?


[07/08/2021 5:25 PM] Kaven#6681
and going forward how are we to determine which nodes to use, their ip addresses, and in large enough amount to be functionally private


[07/08/2021 8:16 PM] glasgowm#9381
I was just guessing btw it could be equal and just simpler to not require a node installed - will need to wait for anon. I doubt any benefits could be gained from setting it to your own node (or it would've been a recommended option).


[07/08/2021 10:31 PM] Kaven#6681
i think the benefit is you know it and trust it and you are assured it is up and running instead of having to trust random ip's off the internet


[07/09/2021 5:01 PM] Canberry#7404

They were using an old version of the mixer, got their funds out by updating. Anon is just sorting mine out but they had withdrawn without me noticing - db had corrupted since my m1 is a drama queen and prone to a kernel panic.

Also, ceremonies are complex, and a single bug in a paper or its implementation can make the ceremony compromised.

Pirate Chain uses zk-SNARKs and it‚Äôs privacy by default model is better than privacy Ergo has to offer. I love Ergo but this is just a weak argument.  There are many ways to generate ‚Äúfake coins.‚Äù It isn‚Äôt exclusive to a trusted setup. Which can be viewed and watch and as you pointed all it would take is 1 person to be honest.


[07/29/2021 3:18 PM] glasgowm#9381
Better is subjective here. Rich contracts and simplicity are the priority in Ergo, and smart-contracts make privacy a lot harder. There's also strong arguments for optional privacy for adoption. 

Privacy by default could be enabled for every transaction in Ergo. Maybe the community will do it someday or maybe integrating mix-nets becomes common-place instead.


[07/30/2021 7:23 PM] Dergler#0451
I like the idea of using covert addresses for every box received


[07/31/2021 5:57 AM] 7eVen#9599
I do not get the arguments in favor of the optional privacy models. Mixers are being attacked by governments and alphabet agencies just as mucho as privacy by default coins. They won‚Äôt even let people buy and hold Monero in a transparent address. Also, my rights aren‚Äôt optional and therefore not up for negotiation or for the sake that it gets adopted. Also, If it isn‚Äôt default from the start then it‚Äôs pretty much too late. I love the project. Been big on Ergo since just about the start but we know that it isn‚Äôt as private and secure as Pirate Chain and that‚Äôs fine for many. They all have their uses. I‚Äôll be back each project that puts privacy as a priority. Love Ergo. Love the developers. Love the community.


[07/31/2021 5:59 AM] 7eVen#9599
Even Bitcoin gets a bad wrap for ‚Äúprivate unknown transactions in the scary dark web‚Äù and it has a public ledger. They want to see all transactions and the wallets of everyone. They will not compromise. We should not compromise either.


[07/31/2021 11:11 AM] glasgowm#9381
It's not a compromise ARRR has to make as it doesn't have smart-contracts though? I believe with enough pool participants ergomixer may rival it on privacy too. But Ergo is more meant as a base-layer, other (private) chains will be able to utilise things like ergomixer from ergo, and private-by-default applications and chains can be built ontop (such integrating the mixer into a wallet)


[08/01/2021 9:08 AM] 7eVen#9599
It is a compromise if you go the optional privacy route because you want adoption.


[08/01/2021 9:09 AM] 7eVen#9599
I understand the differences. That‚Äôs fine. Each has its use.


[08/01/2021 9:12 AM] 7eVen#9599
Integrating the mixer into the wallets would be nice.


[08/01/2021 9:13 AM] 7eVen#9599
The more projects that focus and prioritize privacy the better.


[08/01/2021 9:14 AM] 7eVen#9599
In my opinion these coins are in a league of their own and thus should be held to the highest standards.


[08/01/2021 10:32 AM] glasgowm#9381
It's mostly for smart contracts tho afaik. There's just strong arguments for adoption too.

[08/02/2021 11:37 AM] nitram147#5106
That's true, however I forgot to mention another HIGHLY dangerous thing. The computer where MPC ceremony hold place should also be secure and destroyed after the ceremony - otherwise it could leak keys which can be used for construction of fake proofs. There's really strong game theoric incentive to integrate some backdoor to the software or even hardware of MPC computer. There were even attacks (not on MPC computer but on some computer somewhere), where malware transferred private keys out of the device by extremely fast blinking of led diodes on notebook (people couldn't see it, but the high fps camera could). You can even use high frequency audio output or even "esoteric" hard to detect things like high frequency RF noise. You would be surprised what's possible. You could listen to the people communication by pointing hight fps camera through the telescope to the bag of chips behind the window in the 100meters away building (and it's working, there are PoC videos on youtube). Or you can stalk your neighbours through the wifi signal (you can build "wifi" camera, which uses signal strenght of wifi to determine objects behind the wall). There are tons of these "unreal" scifi spy looking examples....

And now imagine that you are building a mixer which will hold billions of dollars and if you are clever enough you can introduce some genius backdoor as I mentioned and drain mixer step by step in a clever way that nobody will know about it. You can became a billionaire. So there's huge game theoric incentive for you to do it. Same goes for the authors of the cryptographic protocol itself and etc.


[08/02/2021 11:43 AM] nitram147#5106
With that amount of money, you can literally change the world if you want. People do various things for much smaller amounts of money. So in this scenario it's almost 100% probable that somebody tried to exploit the MPC ceremony in some way...


[08/02/2021 2:36 PM] danandbeard#2312
There are plenty of reasons to want optional privacy - transparent ledgers are a feature for many use-cases.  e.g. charities  that want everyone to have full access to the flow of funds.  The ability to operate with privacy or with transparency is a feature, I'm not sure why anyone would want fewer options.


[08/06/2021 6:44 AM] 7eVen#9599
Well because it can compromise the privacy and security of others.

is there a good how to guide for the mixer? i have yet to use it


[08/13/2021 11:29 PM] glasgowm#9381
There's one on ergonaut.space and the git.


[08/22/2021 6:32 PM] Kaven#6681
does number of mixes factor out the variable of how many other addresses are mixing with? in other words, it wouldnt matter how many addresses are mixing at a given point in time because your mix will take as long as needed to meet the required number of mixes you set?


[08/22/2021 6:35 PM] Kaven#6681
second question, does achieving good privacy with a mixer require sending funds from one to many addresses? i.e. if i send 19.234 erg and receive 19.234 erg in another addy, then this could be a strong enough indicator to deduce source addy? corollary to this -- would withdrawing arbitrary amounts _over time_ be a good privacy enhancing solution?


[08/22/2021 6:36 PM] Kaven#6681
and whats better splitting withdrawals across addresses, across time, or a mix of both


[08/22/2021 6:36 PM] Kaven#6681
having these privacy considerations broken down into practical advice for the lay person would be super helpful.


[08/22/2021 6:38 PM] Kaven#6681
it seems like chain analysis could do wonders in checking for permutations of original balance that fit the exact number of tokens across other addresses, unless a very complex scheme of recipient addresses is used, and withdrawals from the mixer are spread over a long period of time?


[08/22/2021 8:17 PM] Kaven#6681
i mean should the user just put their entire balance in the mixer and let it run indefinitely and then pay out from there to a temp wallet as needed?


[08/22/2021 8:56 PM] glasgowm#9381
There's rings in the mixer so you can't withdraw exact amounts like that


[08/22/2021 8:57 PM] glasgowm#9381
You can setup a covert address to receive, it'll mix whenever you have the app open and withdraw when done.


[08/22/2021 11:33 PM] Kaven#6681
i mean i can just figure out how to use it, i just feel like i need a checklist of privacy maximizing steps and recommendations


[08/22/2021 11:34 PM] Kaven#6681

i just think there is probably very advanced chain analysis going on, probably ML-assisted even, wondering if the mixer is up to the task and if so, what steps do i need to take to maximize privacy.

They have some ambitious idea regarding the mixer and privacy features


[08/23/2021 2:23 AM] 777even | AgoraNodes#2624
Although it‚Äôs an optional privacy model they could (in theory if it works as planned) rival many privacy coins.


[08/23/2021 2:24 AM] 777even | AgoraNodes#2624
Aside from Pirate Chain, I think Ergo might be able to do a better job of it than  many of the others.


[08/23/2021 3:30 AM] Kaven#6681
my understanding is the privacy features of ergo are superior but exposed as optional primitives. those primitives can then be used to implement superior privacy features. the problem i have is, i'm given too much leeway and and not enough instruction on how to use them. as a newbie, i would want a clear path forward for something as important as the privacy preserving features. i think as it is, a newbie couldnt even use the mixer, and even someone technical like myself could probably botch it and expose originating/source address connections. see my point?


[08/23/2021 4:43 AM] 777even | AgoraNodes#2624
100 percent agree.

Mixer is a black box afaik. The higher the settings the better the mix. It's about making the coins anonymous rather than the user.

You have to look more into the base at the moment to see future possibilities, at the base you have multisig with no signers disclosure, then new features like covert address, multi hop withdrawals discovered slowly thanks to contracts possibilities, mixer can be just run locally at the same time. You can build Monero on top of Ergo, will it have better privacy guarantees? it is yet to be discovered. But you can think of private order books for example at the same time, similar to a simple and interesting payment network. I think that combining these things with NYM in the future can have more sense for scalable privacy.

is the anonymity set for ergomixer the boxes actively mixed, or all boxes


[09/08/2021 7:19 PM] Kaven#6681
related - if there are no other mixes, does that negatively impact the anonymity or is that not a variable that matters


[09/08/2021 7:50 PM] glasgowm#9381
Not sure what your first question means. But yes on the second. Or at least the anonymity increasers with pool participation. If there are no other mixes it just won't mix though. Needs something to mix with.


[09/08/2021 8:27 PM] Kaven#6681
got ya, so anonymity set is only mixer participants


[09/08/2021 8:28 PM] Kaven#6681
i notice there are several mixing levels that correspond to 30/60/90 mixes, is there any way to benchmark the security each level provides? i dont know what context to put these numbers in.


[09/08/2021 8:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
the probability of guessing the original box after n mixes is 1/2^n

when you say 1/2^n the n corresponds to the 30/60/90 of the levels?


[09/08/2021 9:45 PM] glasgowm#9381
yeh


[09/08/2021 9:48 PM] glasgowm#9381
boxes are indistinguishable from the outside. So you have a 50/50 shot at guessing each box it goes through - so guessing the original box after it's went through `n` mixes has a probability of `1/2^n`


[09/08/2021 10:05 PM] Kaven#6681
so level 1 at 30 mixes is already a 1 in 9.3E-10 odds of identifying box


[09/08/2021 10:06 PM] Kaven#6681
or ^10 i guess since i phrased it as inverse, but yeah


[09/08/2021 10:08 PM] Kaven#6681
level one is 1 in a billion chance


[09/08/2021 10:08 PM] Kaven#6681
level 2 is 1 in a quintillion chance


[09/08/2021 10:11 PM] Kaven#6681
aaaaaand level 3 would be 1 in 1.2 octillion


[09/08/2021 10:12 PM] Kaven#6681
but you know.... that only addresses the probability of "cracking" the mix right. like straight up brute force guessing the boxes. i think chain analysis is much subtler than that and likely uses ML to track down your exit boxes


[09/08/2021 10:12 PM] Kaven#6681
i'm guessing with low utilization of the mixer, i.e. low anonymity set, proper chain analysis can unmask your Tx easily, no?


[09/08/2021 10:25 PM] glasgowm#9381
How would it track them down? There's a 50% probability it'll be sent to either one. It uses half-mix boxes that allow 2 deposits from separate people and output to 2. 

Not sure though as I've only skimmed the paper and it describes a couple different implementations. Paying the mixing fee externally seems to break privacy so I'm not sure how it's handled atm


[09/08/2021 10:41 PM] Kaven#6681
i understand that for 1 mix session there is a vanishingly small chance of being provably linked to a withdrawal address. i'm thinking more like, over time, your patterns of tokens sent from source wallet and possible withdrawal addy's could be correlated strongly enough to identify you perhaps.


[09/08/2021 10:42 PM] Kaven#6681
seems like you only get full benefit if you use a different wallet address for each withdrawal box, and thus sort of an 'entropy' of your tokens scattered across more and more withdrawal addresses


[09/08/2021 10:43 PM] Kaven#6681
because if you reuse the same withdrawal addy's over time, like you would in real life for friends, vendors, exchanges, or whatever. it seems like that activity could be correlated no?


[09/08/2021 11:03 PM] anon2020s#6116
there are different aspects to discuss. 
- for sure, if you send 1000 Erg to mixer and after millions of rounds withdraw all of them to one single address, the security gain will be ruined. It is very important to withdraw carefully, to several addresses and with some time intervals.
- This mixer is non-interactive with no middle man. you only work on your side and interact with blockchain.
assume the mixing as a series of mini-mixes (rounds). At each round, you simply mix with one available box from another user. note that there is no interaction with that user. You simply fetch the available boxes, choose one of them, create a tx spending your box and that box and creating two 50-50 boxes. Only you and the other party will know the mapping, and no one else will distinguish the mapping.
- in theory each round's distinguishability is 2^-1 for any observer but 100% for each participant.
therefor, in theory the final distinguishability is 2^(-rounds).
- in the worst case practice this distinguishability can be 100%. consider there are only you and an attacker mixing the boxes. in each step he knows the mapping, so he knows the final mapping as well. Here comes the pool size, if there are more people in the mixing pool, at least some of the boxes will be mixed with other people's, resulting in more indistinguishability.

[09/08/2021 11:39 PM] Kaven#6681
does the backend contain any logic that uses the count of unique mix participants? or will it happily run all 30 or 60 mixing rounds with the same party?


[09/09/2021 10:42 AM] nitram147#5106
You cannot find whether is somebody an unique participant - that's simply unpossible in anonymous/pseudonymous systems.


[09/09/2021 11:10 AM] anon2020s#6116
- there is no way to differentiate between boxes in the pool, your mixer only knows yours and the mapping of last mixed boxes with others. also, it is not interactive, so you do not have any kind of interaction with others to avoid them.

- Mixer fetches the available boxes and picks one randomly. 
Note that there is some delays between mixes and it is configurable, so the whole mixing parties are working asynchronously. 

- you can configure your mixer to mix every 10 minutes or every 10 days. 
the idea is if there are more than two parties in the mixing pool at any time during your mixing period, suddenly some of the boxes will be picked from a parties which is not the attacker.

- for sure, if you consider the whole system is only mixing by you and attacker, or if all other parties are corrupted and colluding with the attacker, the security is gain is zero. 

- Simply, it is a non-interactive multi party protocol in which the colluding parties should not be ALL other parties. So, if at least one honest party is mixing in the pool, the resulting map will be indistinguishable to some degree to the attacker.


[09/09/2021 4:15 PM] Kaven#6681
sorry to be tedious, but how do "there is no way to differentiate between boxes in the pool" and "in the worst case practice this distinguishability can be 100%" coexist?


[09/10/2021 7:59 AM] anon2020s#6116
read the full sentence:
" there is no way to differentiate between boxes in the pool, your mixer only knows yours and the mapping of last mixed boxes with others."

you only know about the mappings of your boxes. 

consider the case that only you and me are mixing and no one else, so there are no boxes in the pool that me and you do not know the mapping of. however, the mapping is not known to an outside observer.

if someone else joins the pool, there will be some boxes of mine and him which you do not know the mapping with more that 50% guess. same for me about yours and his.

Curious as to what your  intention of adding a meme coin to the mixer is, would it be educational like I am assuming? If someone holds the meme coins and they can easily use the mixer wit low risk then maybe more people would use it I am guessing


[09/12/2021 10:18 AM] anon2020s#6116
exactly, for educational purpose. It will make the use of mixer risk free for beginners. 
as you may know any token is mixable by mixer. I only can add a new token to the dashboard and make some default pools for it. All other tokens are mixable too through custom token option.


[09/12/2021 5:13 PM] Chris Ray#2713
Cool, I sent kushtis through the mixer after I saw Glasgow had mixed them, became familiar with sending custom tokens after messing up first, mostly people want an easy route, and honestly setting policy for a custom token threw me off for some reason, looking forward to it

[09/13/2021 6:17 AM] Kaven#6681
i mean, i realize "blacklisting" depends on the exchange of course. i guess i'm just wondering about tainting coins. does being non-custodial remove this issue?

[09/13/2021 6:40 AM] Kaven#6681
more wondering the technical side of ergomixer tainting coins or not


[09/13/2021 6:44 AM] tflynn#6411
Oh if people are trying to track illegal activity through specific coins an ergo mixer would make that impossible. Therefore tracking would be pointless. That also means labeling some coins as tainted would be pointless as after that point anyone could have them. So no not taintable


[09/13/2021 6:52 AM] Kaven#6681
ok so i guess i just mean, once a coin goes thru ergomixer, is there any way to know that it was mixed


[09/13/2021 6:54 AM] Kaven#6681
if i understand correctly its a simple matter of knowing the addresses for the mixer contracts on eth/bsc, or the wallet addresses of the mixer service for btc


[09/13/2021 6:55 AM] Kaven#6681
wondering how "tainting" works with ergomixer, if at all.


[09/13/2021 10:31 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yes you can tell it's mixed, because it's only traceable back to the mixer.


[09/13/2021 10:31 AM] glasgowm#9381
I think both CEXs and "DEXs" already do this to an extent. Not for mixed coins, but using tradeogre can do it


[09/13/2021 12:22 PM] anon2020s#6116
it's true for any mixed coin on almost any ledger I know. You can tell if a coin is mixed or not due to its history and contract address. 
But, when you withdraw the mixed coins (during the mix or after), you can regularly  move them around since they are regular boxes with regular contracts (like other coins in the network). this will eliminated the tainting issue to some degree. you can do this manually or using multi-hop withdrawal (available at https://ergoutils.org/#/others).
this feature will be integrated into mixer in the future.
"Your mixer withdrawal will go through a bunch of random addresses and you will receive them from an ordinary address" -ergoutils

There are rummer that some exchanges care about mixed coins like btc,... AFAIK they care about custodial laundering services (e.g on dark web) and do not care about Samourai wallet for example. Also, there is a maximum depth of history to be monitored, which multi-hop will address this problem in most cases.

that Cardano Mixer has to be custodial because Cardano doesn't have sigma protocols right?


[10/02/2021 9:27 AM] mhs_sam#1471
That's interesting to me. I will take a look in a few days. anyway the website indicates "Trusted setup ceremony and mainnet release". So it needs a trusted setup at least.

also, ergofaucet is almost ready. I'm waiting for some UI changes.


[10/04/2021 12:31 PM] vegycslol#1714
In mixer it says `distribute erg in different rings automatically or manually`, what do you need to click for this to be done automatically? That part is not intuitive to me


[10/04/2021 1:02 PM] glasgowm#9381
a covert address will automatically place into rings based on your settings when creating the address. I'd assume there's a default setting for the normal mixing method too.


[10/04/2021 1:38 PM] vegycslol#1714
I just want to see the procedure how my grandma would mix the coins (preferably it would be a 1 click for mostly good enough privacy or have a security guarantee slider or smth), i wouldn't even let her see those advanced options, they're mostly needed by maybe 1% of the users imo (if many users are using the mixer)

Hello, when using the ergomixer on the ergoutils website, I was trying to send some NFTs out of my wallet with a super small amount of ERG, which I think was not enough to cover the mixer fee.  How can i resolve this?

I sent another transaction through the hop after doing this with an amount of 1 ERG, and that transactions went through fine, but this one is still stuck


[11/01/2021 10:57 AM] glasgowm#9381
There's nothing for your NFTs to mix with is the problem. I believe @anon2020s picking them out your database is the only way to get them back.

ah I was only mixing 2 Ergs for some testing, I guess under 10 there's not enough to mix with?


[11/11/2021 7:37 PM] anon2020s#6116
yes, mixing is a collaboration with others through the blockchain. If no one is present in the selected mixing pool (1ERG in your example) your mixer waits and waits. Before starting a mix, you can see the Ring Status in the mixer to find out if other/enough users are mixing in the desired ring.

btw i noticed that samouri wallet's implementation of coinjoin makes additional mixes after a certain point free to the user. i assume to encourage a larger anonymity set for everyone. is there any possibility of incentivizing this type of behavior on ergomixer? basically incentivize users to leave their tokens in the mixer for arbitrarily long period?

[12/13/2021 8:01 PM] anon2020s#6116
while working separately on implementing the profit sharing dapp, I'm researching some possibilities for liquidity pooling for the mixer. Simply the mixer should incentives users to mix large amount of tokens for a long time in order to receive some rewards. These users will make the rings bigger resulting in larger anonymity sets. 
There are some technical and privacy concerns to be addressed.

üôè 

[12/13/2021 8:08 PM] Kaven#6681
what if there is a threshold where the mix fee is positive, and then it declines with each mix, eventually going negative i.e. accruing small fees from the new entrants? sorry i know thats pretty non-technical haha


[12/13/2021 8:09 PM] Kaven#6681
anyway great to hear you're looking at incentivizing mixer liquidity! üôå


[12/29/2021 5:58 PM] nitram147#5106
Currently mixer works by spending mixing fee tokens in exchange for paying fee in erg (If you're mixing two 10erg boxes, you want to have also two 10erg boxes on the output of the mixing transaction, however fees have to payed from somewhere - there are boxes containing ergs which you can use as the another input to the mixing transaction and pay erg fee from them - however you have to burn some mixing tokens in order to do so and also recreate the boxes on the same smartcontract address with new amount of erg equal to old amount minus fees. You can buy these tokens before mixing from another box).


[12/29/2021 6:01 PM] nitram147#5106
That's the current scheme based from my observation (if I remeber correctly there wasn't any detailed specification of this process (it's current implementation) in the ergomixer whitepaper).


[01/01/2022 7:34 PM] Galim81#0252
Hi There, 
I have a few questions on the mixer. I am looking at transaction privacy and see the Mixer as being an option. I‚Äôm average at best from a technical point of view so apologies if some of these questions aren‚Äôt relevant. 
1)    In an ideal scenario (sufficient participants and no network issues), is there an average time to complete a mixer request or a maximum theoretical time it could take. What is the fastest time it could be completed?
2)    Is there an upper maximum to the number of mixer requests that can be processed through the mixer dapp?
3)    Is there an upper maximum to the number of tokens that can be submitted at one time? 
4)    Is there a minimum value to the token that can be submitted?
5)     On a test mix I did the fee for a 10 erg mix was 0.4erg. Can the fee scale up and down dynamically? Can thresholds be set where, for instance, mixes of under 10 erg are free, then put in % bands depending on the value being mixed and finally adding a maximum cap to the fee. 
6)    In a Trader/consume transaction. Is there a way of using the Mixer at the centre of a 2 party transaction. Person buying goods, funds go into the mixer to hide the senders details (consumers), funds move to the trader in a way to hide their receiving address. (issue to a covert address). End result is that neither the sender or received can see the other persons wallet address. 
Sorry for all the questions and I appreciate any input people can provide. 
Cheers

This service will provide a way for dapps to distribute gains among the dapps‚Äô token holders.

The first implementation of this will tokenise ErgoMixer, then subsequently Ergo Auction House, and Ergo Raffle.

The ErgoMixer income (in ERG and other tokens) is currently received by its creator (‚Äòanon2020s‚Äô), since it has only one stakeholder at the moment. He has announced that he is willing to create and sell some tokens in the near future to obtain more stakeholders; let‚Äôs call this token $MIX. Later, anyone with these $MIX tokens can stake them in the Profit Sharing contract and obtain the mixer‚Äôs incomes proportional to their staked tokens.

So, it will not be way a way to ‚Äòstake‚Äô ERG at first. However in the future it could be used in some creative services to provide ERG-staking.

Token Id: 83c473e4ad477b1921023f61ab5bd1550a242c287475ff1c804f029d97672ae7

It does not have any estimated value right now, maybe zero. I will airdrop and distribute this token in the next weeks. Holders of this token are eligible to receive ErgoMixer's token when it is ready.

The tokenomics of the final token is not clear yet, but whatever it comes to be, some percentage of the tokens will be airdropped to community members, privacy and mixer related dapps, related tutorials, dapps and wallets integrating with the mixer, appkit development, ergo DAO, etc.

[02/11/2022 7:40 PM] anon2020s#6116 (pinned)
Some clarifications:
- Ergomixer is not OWNed by me, it belongs to the community. It is open source without any reserved rights, so anyone can improve it, fork it, or deploy it as soon as the result is open source too.
- Ergomixer is programmable (through APIs) and you can build on top of it
- I have an admin panel and I only can add OFFICIAL token support, define the rings and rounds, and set the maximum tx fee, nothing else. However, any token is mixable even if it is not added officially. 
- This governance power will be handed to the community too.


[02/11/2022 7:40 PM] anon2020s#6116
According the FEMX token:
- Ergomixer will be tokenized this year. I'm developing the so called Profitsharingdapp while still investigating other options like liquidity mining. 
- By any means it get tokenized, I believe it belongs to these folks:
-- users
-- liquidity providers (making pools bigger and available)
-- wallet developers 
-- dapps using it
-- peoples contributing to it by any means (writing or translating articles, people who brings privacy awareness to the community, vloggers, youtubers,...)
-- security guys who spend time auditing the mixer or comparing it to other privacy tools
-- Bounty hunters and white hackers (making it robust and secure)
-- Bridges (opening the ergo's privacy tooling to other chains)
-- Ergo as a whole (probably through to be built DAO)
-- Ergo hodlers
-- probably others whom I did not mentioned here

Therefore, I needed a tool to account for the contributions before the mixer is being tokenized. FEMX is just a tool for me to track the contributions. 
So the total supply and related stuffs are not meaningful here. The whole supply may or may not be used.
I will send this token to anyone the community feels his/her efforts makes the ergo's privacy and security stronger and widespread.

All the above will be airdropped by mixer's token when its time arrives. What percentage of mixer's token will be airdropped? idk now. Probably all of it, putting aside a percentage for future development and privacy DAO.

Does mixing require a P2PK address? I wonder if miners would be interested in auto-mixed subpools that contribute liquidity to the mixer while holding payouts. Would be a win-win for miners who want private funds and other mixer users who need liquidity. But this would require compatibility with P2S addresses.

Would it be possible to support using propBytes instead of checking for public key? Haven't gotten the chance to look into mixer too much so not sure if that's possible. If not, subpools support P2S outputs, so maybe the subpool could ensure that its outputs are under the mixing contract and have the pk of the recipient miner coded in somehow.

Anything major?


[02/13/2022 12:43 AM] anon2020s#6116
completely refactored backend, custom appkit removed and using the official appkit, different database and atomic transactions for more robustness.
On the UI/UX there is not much, a few more options and features like withdraw tokens (useful for stuck tokens), export private keys.

üì¢  ErgoMixer 4.0.0 is released!

Changelog:

- Database migration to SLICK
- New APIs for exporting private keys and withdrawing assets
- Replacing custom AppKit with the official AppKit
- More unit tests
- Adding github actions
- Fix for sigusd/sigrsv actions (due to a bug in wasm)
- New features: withdraw assets, export private keys


Note 1: Shutdown the mixer if you have a running mixer. It should run smoothly but make sure to backup prior to upgrade.

Note 2: As a new feature in this version, you can export the private keys of your covert addresses, one by one or all at once. It is a good practice to export and save them in a safe place.

[02/22/2022 9:15 AM] Velvia#6830
How long does it usually take for ERG to go through the mixer? Used 6 hops.
Mixer says it was successfully obfuscated ~10 hours ago, but the transaction has not appeared in the explorer yet.
It's still stuck in the deposit address.

I was using the mixer and tried the hops utility from ergoutils.org. It looks like it is stuck in the withdrawal (from mixer) or deposit (for hops) address. What should I do now? I think this probably a hops question, but I'm not sure. https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/c6005f64c167b7d90faed162f91b7e8bbf2d6751766bb4ac6a055a242351974f

[02/23/2022 4:40 PM] SoCool#6419
Would there be opposition to me trying to get the ergo mixer frontend out of react app rewired into a basic minimal webpack build? react app rewired is terribly slow compared to straight webpack, and it's less well supported these days (various features it locks away such as watch which people still haven't gotten working well with react-app-rewired)

Also I understand it's on a deprecated version of MUI? I'd be willing to take a stab at updating it to latest, I've fair bit of experience with MUI


[02/23/2022 4:42 PM] SoCool#6419
also any reason for it to be on node 12 vs. upgrading to LTS? 12 is pretty old now, and it's just for the compilation steps regardless - not used at runtime given it runs in browser

I tried setting up the Ergodex bots together in a Docker container, and it looks like Kafka Manager and Mixer both use port 9000 on localhost. I'm not very familiar with the process of setting Docker containers up. Do you just change the ports when you do something like: docker run -p 127.0.0.1:9001:9001 --restart=always -v D:\ergoMixer -d ergomixer/mixer:latest? Or is there another solution?

Hello friends! I'm a writer by trade, and bilingual to boot, so I'll be looking to translate docs from English to French in the medium future (working on some docs for NETA ATM, it's how I got introduced to the eco-system). I was wondering if Ergo-mixer was already in multiple languages, and if French was already done? Thanks!

I got everything building without errors with all the latest fancies üëç however now I need to have a backend to point at. Is there a public ergomixer backend? I just need to see how completely jacked up the UI is so I can start the laborious task of fiddling with CSS that plays different now and the react router changes et al

[02/24/2022 10:26 PM] $aX#5658
@SoCool Thanks for doing this work. The backend is in the same Github as the frontend, but it sounds like you found what you needed


[02/24/2022 10:29 PM] SoCool#6419
Yep! Thanks! Just got sidetracked working out why some TX weren't working and found out a main node is not syncing, now I'm back on the case of why the footer is stopping things from rendering.. wee, troubleshooting.

So far I'm not getting compiler errors out of switching to the new mui stuff, mostly had to change import paths and it seems ok?

Router on the other hand is mad as shit and had some pretty big API breaking changes so I'll have to rejigger that. Being in webpack though is quite nice


[02/24/2022 11:01 PM] SoCool#6419

Ok so who can help me with how to test this? I'm going through various forms and fixed up everything I've found, as well as resolving all of the react router API breaking changes; UIs look the same now etc.

Now I need to functionally send something to mix and I've created a bunch of covert addresses and selected rings etc as I was testing forms - but don't know how to actually *use the mixer*


[02/25/2022 4:54 PM] SoCool#6419

[02/25/2022 5:26 PM] glasgowm#9381
Create a covert address, get the address it sends you. Coins will be sent there + mixed. Then you can select a withdrawal address.


[02/25/2022 5:27 PM] SoCool#6419
Aye, I send an erg and kushti to a covert address after configuring its ring as such - and was greeted with a nice error in the statdetail after it tried rendering actual results showing up in the address so üëç heh


[02/25/2022 5:28 PM] SoCool#6419
Tracking that down... then maybe I'll find another when I try to withdrawal it heh


[02/25/2022 6:16 PM] SoCool#6419
I sent the amount of erg and kushti it was requesting - I can follow some of the TXs and see the kushti and erg floating around but it thinks the kushti didn't get deposited at all


[02/25/2022 6:17 PM] SoCool#6419
though history shows the kushti status as "running" so is it still executing mixing transactions?


[02/25/2022 6:18 PM] SoCool#6419
Ah yeah, it says "Kushti: 0 completed, Mixing: 1000 kushti"


[02/25/2022 6:18 PM] SoCool#6419
How long does it take to finish mixing? I sent it like over a half hour ago


[02/25/2022 6:21 PM] SoCool#6419
Huh I see the kushti got popped out to some address where Explorer shows it having 43k ergs and zero TX, perhaps I shouldn't just willy nilly send stuff to these covert addresses from the docker images default config but rather I should be editing that config before I test around much..

[02/25/2022 6:35 PM] SoCool#6419
It appears to all be working and well - need someone else to do more testing and or review on this please. It's a ton of changes but all just for lib updates etc. As I'm going through testing stuff myself I'm seeing no more errors but I'll continue to complete this one mix and withdrawal and otherwise I think someone who knows *more* of the functions will have to either give me some testcases or do some testing on their own - with node lts 16 it's easy to get up and running `npm run start` and it will try to use the mixer at `http://localhost:9000`


[02/25/2022 7:39 PM] SoCool#6419
Welp I guess I can't get that 1 erg back - stuff keeps showing up and when I try to withdraw it says "Transaction being generated" but nothing happens. It did actually create the withdrawal tx for the 1000 kushti so I got that back heh


[02/25/2022 9:50 PM] SoCool#6419
Watching a youtube video on this it shows the history listing things going from queued to running, I have a bunch of things that all just sit their in queued forever; only the kushti seemed to actually move to running and let me withdraw it

[03/25/2022 10:43 AM] arkadias#4896
well I wanted to know since mixer is slow from not a lot of use would an acceptable way to break the link from one wallet to another be to use a non kyc exchange as a middle man and withdraw from it into a covert address possibly withdrawing the boxes early? And a follow up to that is can I have a covert address connected to a node or something so that each box is withdrawn is to a different derived wallet


[03/25/2022 10:43 AM] arkadias#4896
I probably worded that horribly


[03/25/2022 10:48 AM] arkadias#4896
at a minimum if I were to send a few boxes through the covert address, is it possible to have mixer automatically change the withdraw address each time a new box is finished mixing


[03/25/2022 10:48 AM] arkadias#4896
sort of like a set and forget setup

You can set tons of withdraw addresses in the mixer, just derive them on the node and set them as the withdrawal addresses in the covert address bit.

Not sure what you mean withdrawing to a non-kyc address but if you withdraw it early it won't be mixed? Mixer's speed depends on how many rounds you set - the anonymity set is limited by it's use but not it's speed (unless there is no one to mix with - but for ERG generally it's fine ime)


[03/25/2022 11:27 AM] arkadias#4896
*"Not sure what you mean withdrawing to a non-kyc address"* Specifically using an exchange as a first step since withdraws from an exchange like kucoin all typically come from one address.


[03/25/2022 11:28 AM] arkadias#4896
*"but if you withdraw it early it won't be mixed?"* what I mean by this is generally its set for 30 rounds. Currently I have a box in the mixer that is on round 3 after 24 hours, presumably if I withdrew it now its still partially mixed


[03/25/2022 11:29 AM] arkadias#4896
*"You can set tons of withdraw addresses in the mixer, just derive them on the node and set them as the withdrawal addresses in the covert address bit."* Is it possible to automate this though? or is it simpler to just derive them and add them all manually?


[03/25/2022 11:33 AM] arkadias#4896
And a follow up question regarding covert addresses specifically the deposit is set to 250 erg if in theory one sent 2000 erg to it does it just start 4 mixes?


[03/25/2022 11:33 AM] glasgowm#9381
Sure you could if you wrote a script for it


[03/25/2022 11:33 AM] glasgowm#9381

just found a bug in the new release. In some cases, when you withdraw the mixer may encounter "hopRound is required" error and crashes.
a quick fix is to add "hopRounds = 0" to the config file.

[05/31/2022 7:03 AM] Ulmo#5367
Get your Ergo Nation ID now!

Step 1. Create ID
- Create a new Ergo wallet address. This address is your anonymous ID. Do not reveal it to anyone. 
- Use the mixer to send 1 ERG into it. The mixing process may take some time. Start it right away to be ready for the verification event.
- All funds going in and out of the ID address must go through the mixer to preserve anonymity. 

Step 2. Verify ID
- Join the first monthly ID verification event on 7.6.2022 at 20.00 UTC for instructions. The event itself will start 20.15 UTC, and end 20.30 UTC.
- Participants will play a short game. If successful, they will be able to verify the ID on-chain.

Step 3. Use ID
- Ergo projects can engage the ID holders in governance, testing, whitelist, rewards, tasks, etc.
- The IDs will gather reputation through actions in the ecosystem. We encourage projects to engage those IDs that actively support decentralization, anonymity and the spirit of Ergo (see Ergo Manifesto).

[06/29/2022 4:20 PM] Kaven#6681
a few other questions.

1. what is the play.http.secret.key on line 1 of the config. 
2. would it increase my privacy to use a different explorer/api or is that irrelevant
3. does using -only- my own node increase or decrease my privacy in any way
4. when you configure the mixer to add hops to withdrawal is there anyway to add delays and jitter to the hops? if its just a quick series of equal spaced hops, it might have obvious 'mixer withdrawal' signature

thanks in advance for any help on these


[06/29/2022 7:53 PM] Kaven#6681
hmm there are 2 reference.conf's and a application.conf in the 4.1.1 release, all differ a little

[06/30/2022 8:58 PM] anon2020s#6116
- Docker is being built from the repo code, very easy to use. Go ahead and try.
- play.http.secret.key: since the mixer is running locally on your system and there are no Cookie and CSRF problems, changing it does not increase/decrease your security. 
- your own node only and different explorer: I do not recommend using your node only. Your node might get out of sync or down. Also, using only one node might have some privacy issues. Depends however on your adversarial assumptions and if someone is monitoring node traffics. 
Using a different explorer is fine if enough people are using it, due to traffic monitoring issues.
- Hops: hop delay is not random (maybe should be but it's not atm). The required confirmations between hops is configureable in the config. 
- independent of the mixer version, default values are set in reference.conf. Any values set in application.conf will override the values in reference.conf.


[06/30/2022 9:29 PM] Kaven#6681

They do a L0 mixnet like Tor, but its token incentivized. They seem to be open source and fit with Ergo values. Currently seem to be working to integrate with popular BTC wallets. I think definitely worth a look.

           do xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/ergoMixer.app

this gives - zsh: parse error near `do'


[08/16/2022 7:57 PM] glasgowm#9381
run it in bash


[08/16/2022 8:58 PM] Chris Horticulturalist#2573
changed to bash , closed & reopened terminal - still getting "ergoMixer" is damaged...
Ran
 do xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/ergoMixer.app
gives the following
-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `do'

[08/16/2022 11:11 PM] anon2020s#6116
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/ergoMixer.app


[08/16/2022 11:16 PM] anon2020s#6116
Yes. When other parties are using shorter rings.
In each round, the tokens in the two mixing boxes are divided equally between the two output boxes (apparently for privacy reasons). 
On average if you choose bigger rings you get more rounds but the exact number of rounds cannot be guaranteed.


[08/17/2022 1:46 AM] theta_decay#5677
Understood, thank you.


[08/17/2022 2:15 PM] Chris Horticulturalist#2573
Mixer is working away, thanks!


[08/23/2022 12:10 AM] $aX#5658
Do you have a current update on progress? It's been a month since this and I really want to mix some ERG with the new updates üòÑ


[08/25/2022 8:07 AM] navip#4838
Anyone knows if I can set multiple addresses for manual withdrawal? Is this even possible?


[08/25/2022 8:10 AM] navip#4838
Tried loading from json, but it picks only first address


[08/25/2022 8:14 AM] navip#4838
Ah, I misunderstood that I can split what I mixed and withdraw to multiple addresses.


[08/26/2022 9:37 PM] navip#4838
@anon2020s I think there is a "bug" in mixer. Since my sigrsv mix is stuck for days in Building mix boxes I tried running another mixer on different system and adding same amount of sigrsv to mix with myself, but from both terminals I see there is error Not enough nanoergs to create 1 change box.
Is this something I f'ed up?


[08/26/2022 9:39 PM] navip#4838
Or someone needs to sprinkle little ergo dust somewhere for box build process to begin


[08/26/2022 9:41 PM] anon2020s#6116
I'll investigate soon, thanks for reporting.


[08/26/2022 9:43 PM] anon2020s#6116
sorry sorry, I was stuck in progress with SigUSD wasm's issue, but just found out that Minotaur wallet has a proper implementation. On it and will update soon.


[08/30/2022 4:35 PM] anon2020s#6116
could you send me the logs please? DM.


[08/30/2022 4:58 PM] navip#4838
Sent you a DM, I cut the part from logs that are showing error. If you want I can send you log from other server where I tried adding another mixing box as well


[09/16/2022 10:46 PM] $aX#5658

Thank you @anon2020s for the Backend release! If you do not end up re-writing the build instructions, I will see if I can help and add a pull request. Sounds like you have help with updating Frontend part of mixer


[09/26/2022 9:03 PM] Pulsarz#9208
Is there a reason the max ring for sigusd is 250? Seems a little low when compared to 250 ERG ring no?


[09/28/2022 10:20 AM] anon2020s#6116
any ring that community want can be added.

üì¢  ErgoMixer and EIP37 Hardfork
ErgoMixer is able to handle Hard Forks, however:
- in case of fork, you may see a lot of errors in the log indicating txn failures, double spending,.... That's normal and will calm down after a few hours.
- make sure your mixer is connecting to upgraded nodes. The list of nodes is available in "Configuration" tab and is editable via config file. 
- If you're using your local node, make sure to upgrade it.
- stopping mixer during the upgrade is **not necessary but strongly recommended**.
- if you're an expert, you can change and increase the confirmation requirement and the time intervals in the config file.
- if you're a normal user, please stop the mixer before the fork and turn it on a few hours after the fork.


[09/28/2022 11:37 AM] Pulsarz#9208
Although sigusd ring activity is very low as far as I can see, adding a 500 and/or 1000 ring might be interesting. 250sigusd is just too little I think, 250 erg ring is 2.5x that value. But I unddrstand too many rings will divide the available fund too much between rings I suppose.

hello sir, how do I withdraw from the covert address if I selected manually withdraw? at the top next to 'set address' is the 'withdraw now' option, but it's unclickable for me. status is also complete


[11/16/2022 10:24 AM] glasgowm#9381
You need to set the address(es) first.

[01/21/2023 5:37 PM] timreg7#6732
It's hard bc new things are emerging all the time (stealth addresses, etc) but I think it would be good to establish a baseline and teach people the principles of maintaining privacy


[02/12/2023 1:41 PM] Pulsarz#9208
@anon2020s my first test mix just finished but when I go to mixing history I get a blank page now every time, running latest release, seen this before?


[02/12/2023 10:17 PM] $aX#5658
Same bug for me also w/ latest code


[02/14/2023 8:06 AM] anon2020s#6116
@$aX what do you see exactly? a blank page or a page saying nothing to show?
Can you send the logs of this event? The logs when you open this tab.

nothing in the application log itself

was fine before the mix finished


[02/14/2023 8:09 AM] Pulsarz#9208
tried adding a new mix to see if it helped but alas


[02/14/2023 8:11 AM] anon2020s#6116
thanks, I'll check. while the mix is not finished AND is not fully withdrawn, the mix will not be shown in history page. 
I have to check the issue with finished mixes in history page.


[02/14/2023 8:12 AM] Pulsarz#9208
Oh sorry, it's not withdrawn yet afaik


[02/14/2023 8:12 AM] Pulsarz#9208
but it's not on the active mixes either, unless i'm missing something


[02/14/2023 8:14 AM] anon2020s#6116
did you set the withdraw address or not?


[02/14/2023 8:15 AM] Pulsarz#9208
it's been months since I started a 1 erg mix so my memory may be failing me, but I don't think so


[02/14/2023 8:15 AM] Pulsarz#9208
I will double check my derived addresses in my other wallets (it was just a test)


[02/14/2023 8:15 AM] Pulsarz#9208
hah


[02/14/2023 8:15 AM] Pulsarz#9208
yes I got it in a new wallet indeed, sorry


[02/14/2023 8:16 AM] Pulsarz#9208

[02/14/2023 8:16 AM] anon2020s#6116
and please check a config for me, "prunedb" is false or ture?


[02/14/2023 8:17 AM] Pulsarz#9208
false


[02/14/2023 8:18 AM] Pulsarz#9208
but okay, it's only a small issue, funny I even forgot to check the test wallet if it received anything

When allocating mixed erg to multiple withdrawal addresses, does this generally mean, separate wallets or separate 'receive' addresses within the same wallet?


[04/17/2023 10:15 AM] glasgowm#9381
whatever you specify


[04/17/2023 10:37 AM] Zach | Picaro#5270
Regarding privacy: does it make that much of a difference from the outside looking in?


[04/17/2023 11:16 AM] glasgowm#9381
I wouldn't think so.
