SigmaO intends to provide Ergo users the ability to create Call or Put options on EIP-4 tokens, materialized by a standard EIP-4 token.

Reminder: An option contract offers the buyer the possibility but not the obligation to buy (Call) or sell (Put) the underlying asset at a fixed exercise price.

A sample usage of SigmaO contracts:

Update:
- the new UI in progress: 
    -create, buy, sell, exercise options pages have a fist version.
    - I'm working on the display of compound options (options on options)
    - A presentation page and a user dashboard are still to be done.
- The off-chain bot is in draft
Trying to get it in test before the end of the week.

Display of compound option is done.
The user dashboard minimal version is available.
Adding a new "open sale token" contract matching an "open buy token" contract.
First sale done, still need to work on the limits.

Open buy order contract allows to create an exercible buy order on any EIP-4 token.
It includes an amount or ERG to be spent by anyone providing the right amount of a given token in the outputs(1) of the transaction sent to the buyer address.
Focusing on the result, the buy order can be spent by any address or smart contract delivering the right amount of tokens.
It is used in Sigmao to buy priced options or any EIP-4 token at fixed price.

Be careful and use small amounts for testing.

Let starts to have fun:
    A compound option Call on Put COMET is available, as well as few other tests.
    It can be purchased using a SigmaO (https://www.sigmao.cc/buy-tokens), and one is also available in the Auction House !
    https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/specific/c064f0b6aecaddc0457648e56598f1cb6a35668c9a139759149a91cc8bf4e1a1
  *Grant to buy at 0.0050 ERG the grant to Sell COMET per 10000 at 8000 nanoERG per COMET up to the 2023-03-20*

@haileypdll viewing the website i find it very overwhelming amount of information as a new user who doesnt know much about options and it‚Äôs intimidating. I think could benefit from some better ux to simplify things. There was a designer looking for a team would you be interested in collaborating with them? @inspiredude

Hey, thanks for the feedback. I would probably need a designer or advices because I don't really see how to address it. On one side there is already too much information, but I would need to add even more to explain in details.


[02/18/2023 4:54 PM] glasgowm#9381
Dashboard could be an icon next to your ERG address

For the rest of the menu items you could have
`CREATE ‚îÇ EXERCISE ‚îÇ BUY ‚îÇ SELL ‚îÇ TOKENS`
or simply
`OPTIONS ‚îÇ TOKENS`

and lots of tool-tips on hover to explain things


[02/18/2023 4:57 PM] haileypdll#3353
thanks, I will try to improve


[02/18/2023 5:03 PM] glasgowm#9381
np, looks very functional! Options are probably a bit abstract for most people though so your biggest hurdle is probably not scaring people away. ChatGPT is handy for writing ELI5 explainers and simplfying things a bit.

Yeah btw hope that doesnt discourage you im excited to really dig into this when im back home next weekend. Would love to see sigma o shine in the ecosystem so all feedback is purely from that perspective


[02/19/2023 7:07 AM] Kahnloc#3368
This is one of the things I was hoping to see on ergo as I do a lot of options on equities and ETFs. Can‚Äôt wait to try this out.


[02/19/2023 8:06 AM] haileypdll#3353
Nah, that's fine thanks, the current design and complexity had a bit afraid you. I will try to add more explanation and pointers.

Nice! CSS/Alignment/Padding still needs some work but looks a lot better


[02/19/2023 10:26 PM] haileypdll#3353
Haha, a short term loan against a Call on Put option on COMET ! At the end those puts have value... no sure considering the fees and the number of transactions.

Hello, I've just tried to exercise a call and a put without issue. https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/14954cd3fe0f51d6a6c7d392ea6659d560d4280a99bc83e0e7f71ebe87b369b2. It seems you try to exercise a Put on SPF token here. Do you have 5 SPF at the connected address to sell them ? The error message means they have not been found.


[02/27/2023 11:43 AM] bunnywabbit#0579
oh right, I'm a dumdum and forgot to actually get the spf tokens ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è works now thanks.

Maybe I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself and it‚Äôs not the final ui


[03/31/2023 4:30 PM] haileypdll#3353
Nah, there is someone (not sure I can give a name yet) working on a re-looking proposal... just got blue mood... be careful that could be orange toomorrow ! especially if you dislike the blue
