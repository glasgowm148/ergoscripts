Topic: The intent is to make Ergo Addresses human friendly. Remembering a sequence of randomly generated address strings is impossible for humans. This project is about creating a DNS service to convert easy to remember strings (i.e. Easy Address) to actual Ergo Wallet addresses. The DNS service would be powered by Ergo blockchain itself and hence, would be decentralized.

Hello 👋🏼
Who's working on this project and what exactly is it?


[02/07/2022 2:04 PM] glasgowm#9381
see the post in #📢│event-announcements for descriptions please. Still sorting all the roles


[02/07/2022 2:23 PM] 6directions#1089
Thank you. Seems like project is what I thought it was. Read their proposal. Curious to talk with someone from the team.

That's the proposal I found in a Dropbox folder 🙂. Thanks @glasgowm . No mention of team members though so I'll wait until one of them stumbles upon this chat.


[02/07/2022 2:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
Welcome @ergo-dns Let me know if anyone else is to be added to this role.


[02/07/2022 5:00 PM] Adoo#5093
Hi all, I submitted this proposal. Happy to kickstart the discussion here to take this forward. 🙂


[02/07/2022 5:03 PM] Adoo#5093
We plan to make a simple service as described in the proposal - a proof of concept.
Bells and whistles can be added over a few iterations. Got to start somewhere.


[02/07/2022 5:08 PM] Adoo#5093
@6directions - Are you interested in this project? How would you like to contribute?


[02/07/2022 6:10 PM] Kurikun#6941
Hi team, I spent a lot of time thinking about this issue and also watching how it was recently (successfully) implemented on Cardano.  I wish your team the best in your project.  I'm happy to share my thinking if it would be beneficial.


[02/07/2022 6:12 PM] Kurikun#6941
As part of my project, I acquired the domain ergonames.com, which you might find useful.


[02/07/2022 8:41 PM] Balb#7267
I’ve been building this dapp as well. I called it Sigma Domains. I’ve written basically everything for the frontend and part of the backend that tracks if the domains have been sent to a new address. I really only have to create a way to store ownership of each domain. I’ve also realized that if this dapp is built right, the registration fees could be used to fun a project catalyst type of dao. Which would help ergo development a lot. Maybe we all could work together?


[02/08/2022 12:46 AM] Kurikun#6941
What does everyone think of the nft solution used over on Cardano by ADA handle? https://adahandle.com/


[02/08/2022 12:47 AM] Kurikun#6941
This is nice, because a) Ergo already supports NFTs, b) you can establish ownership of a name by owning the NFT, which makes transferability so easy and c) you can easily support multiple names per wallet, which the original proposal doesn't support.


[02/08/2022 12:51 AM] Kurikun#6941
There are some drawbacks to this vs Cardano, based on the way that Ergo currently supports NFTs, so it's not all roses.  For example, you'd ideally want to mint an NFT on -demand, when a customer orders one for a specific name.  You'd store the name in one of the registers.  

A "minting policy"  (https://developers.cardano.org/docs/native-tokens/minting-nfts/) would be ideal to "group" these NFTs together and show that they are all authentic.  But Ergo doesn't support minting policies, so there needs to be some other way to determine what's an authentic "Ergo Name NFT".


[02/08/2022 12:55 AM] Kurikun#6941
This could be by issuer address, for example, but maybe other alternatives exist.


[02/08/2022 1:30 AM] NoahErgo#4349
Wow I assumed this submission was by @Balb ! Didnt realize somebody else was working on this too


[02/08/2022 1:30 AM] NoahErgo#4349
You guys should all team up no doubt


[02/08/2022 2:03 AM] 6directions#1089
Hey all.

What a small world haha. I too have been working on this idea.

In fact, I was talking to one of the Ergnome Devs about it, and he pointed me to the Sigma Domains Twitter account @Balb .

Anyway, I'm open to working together to bring it all together, @Adoo , @Balb 

I have put together a lot of the backend functionality:

- token minting
- token burning (for testing, and in case of a fluke)
- token authenticity validation
- address resolution: going from the token name to the address holding the NFT. 

@Kurikun I actually drew inspiration from ADA handle. I very much like what they did. I particularly like the fact that it makes handles dynamic. Meaning, whatever wallet currently holds the token is the address that the handle resolves to. This allows them to be transferable.

@Kurikun , with regards to verifying if the token is authentic: mint address is the approach I've taken. Basically, a single address has to be allocated for minting. Then, one can verify that the address of the first input to the minting tx is equal to the mint address. If it's not, then the token is considered counterfeit.


[02/08/2022 2:05 AM] 6directions#1089
I've been doing some testing today, and have the beginnings of a working proof of concept in a console app.

It can take a token/handle name and ultimately find the address of the wallet holding it, all while verifying the token is not a counterfeit, and that it hasn't been burned.


[02/08/2022 2:06 AM] Balb#7267
I agree. The best way to verify would be with the minting address


[02/08/2022 2:07 AM] Balb#7267
Allowing for domains to be transferable is easy since they will naturally be transferable


[02/08/2022 2:07 AM] Balb#7267
We would just need to create a program that tracks all the domains and then updates with the current address owner of each one


[02/08/2022 2:08 AM] Balb#7267
Could write a script that scans transactions in a block and searches for token ids that match token ids of minted domains and then get the address it was sent to


[02/08/2022 2:11 AM] 6directions#1089
It can also be done in an ad hoc fashion by querying the ergo explorer API.

That way there is no need to keep a database that keeps track of each token's movement and current location.

When you want to know where a token is, you just make a sequence of calls that end up giving you the answer.

Happy to share the sequence of calls that get you from token name to wallet address once I'm back at the computer in the next 1-2 hours.


[02/08/2022 2:13 AM] 6directions#1089
I started looking into a way to perform the sequence of queries that I'm currently making against the ergo explorer api, but against the node API.

For now, the explorer api seems to be sufficient.


[02/08/2022 2:24 AM] Adoo#5093
I was thinking more of a transaction based approach where all the registration data is centralised at one address. It would be faster to parse all the transactions in one address to determine the current ownership status.

NFT Approach
* Pro - Naturally transferrable
* Pro - Proven Implementation in Cardano
* Con - Need to parse entire blockchain to determine current state of ownership
* Time to determine ownership of Name NFT = Current Height (Parse through blockchain in reverse order starting from latest block) * Average Tx Per Block (Parse all transactions in each Block) 

Transaction Approach
* Pro - Need to parse only transaction history of one address to determine current state of ownership
* Con - Transfers would have to be developed.
* Time to determine ownership of Name NFT = All transactions at one address 

Additional Note - 1 easy address per ergo address is not a technical limitation. It is to prevent one address holding too many easy addresses. Imagine early adopters spamming and registering all celebrity names. I think we should solve for it before going live

@Balb , @6directions I am really glad to see so much work has already happened.  Power of community and open-source is really blowing me away. My 2 cents - NFT approach can work if there is a scalable solution to determine the current ownership of Name NFT. A decentralised service which creates a HashMap between easy addresses and ergo addresses based on latest state of blockchain perhaps for O(1) complexity.


[02/08/2022 3:46 AM] Balb#7267
I like that NFT approach better since it'll be more decentralized. I don't think building a solution to determine current ownership will be a tough thing to do imo


[02/08/2022 3:55 AM] 6directions#1089
@Adoo raises some valid points/concerns, though ultimately agree with @Balb . At the very least, it can be a good starting point.

Lookup performance is a legitimate concern at scale. In Cardano, I think the concern is mitigated by the fact that you can use a combination of `policy_id + hex_encoded(asset_name)` to lookup an asset in a single request, the response of which tells you which wallet holds the NFT. All this is possible because of the policy id.

In Ergo, there is a workaround to achieve the same end result, but it takes a few extra steps. I think that, at the very least, it would be worth testing the impact of those "few extra steps" at scale, or "some scale" (like some sort of beta testing). I have been running tests locally and it all works pretty fast, but of course I have thought: how would this scale? As @Balb , I am more inclined towards a more decentralized solution. If it can be dynamic, then even better.

But like I said, it could be a descent starting point. There is definitely some performance testing that would need to be done.


[02/08/2022 3:57 AM] Balb#7267
The approach I was thinking of would be minting nfts on chain and then storing the owner address in a database. Dapps and wallets can call the database for quick lookup times and then we could write scripts that track ownership and then update the database


[02/08/2022 3:58 AM] Balb#7267
and then overtime we could possibly create a network of bots that serve as the database to stop the reliance on a centralized server


[02/08/2022 4:03 AM] 6directions#1089
what are your thoughts on just reading the data from the chain through the explorer api?

I looked into how the explorer reads data from the chain, and was surprised to find that they do a lot of heavy lifting to make on chain data more easily readable/searchable.

They have an off chain component called `Chain Grabber` responsible for syncing blockchain data to an off chain SQL db... They fetch block data and split it into different entities you might find in a block (transactions, inputs, outputs, assets, etc), establish some relationships and save them into a db.

https://github.com/ergoplatform/explorer-backend/blob/master/doc/DesignNotes.md#chain-grabber

It does almost the same thing as cardano's db-sync component. except (I think), there is an instance of db-sync for every cardano node, whereas the ergo explorer's chain grabber is a centralized solution.

either way, the explorer's backend already offers a reliably way to continually sync on chain data to an off chain database, as well as making it more easily searchable.

> NFT approach can work if there is a scalable solution to determine the current ownership of Name NFT
@Adoo , I'm inclined to think the interface exposed by the explorer API might suffice. But at the end of the day, I think we would only be able to get a concrete answer by stress testing it.


[02/08/2022 4:24 AM] Balb#7267
this looks like a better solution. we could call this instead of building our own


[02/08/2022 6:38 AM] Kurikun#6941
>> It is to prevent one address holding too many easy addresses.

The way to prevent this is two-fold: First, you make the names (somewhat) costly.  In the proposal, you mention a nominal fee, like 0.1 Erg.  I think that's really too low and creates the problem you identify.  Remember also that running this service requires an ongoing investment, and a too-low upfront fee will not leave much to run the system over time.

The fees that ADA Handle charged were:
* Legendary (1 character): Auction Only
* Ultra Rare (2 characters): 500 $ADA
* Rare (3 characters): 100 $ADA
* Common (4–7): 50 $ADA
* Basic (8–15): 10 $ADA

These would prevent most people from getting a lot of names.

Secondly, in  their minting process, you had to verify an email address and there was some limit to the number of names you could register at one time per email address.

One cool thing that ADA Handle did was grant free names to people that were helping to build the Cardano ecosystem.  For example, all of the stake pools got a name that was equivalent to their stake pool ticker.  You could grant a free "kushti" for example, so no one could buy that.


[02/08/2022 6:43 AM] Kurikun#6941
This is a possible solution, but it is overly centralized in my opinion, and a single point of failure.  My thought when I was considering this was that yes, my "project" would provide an API that a "client", like a wallet, could call.  But if I ever went out of business, any other app could perform the same lookup as my API could (because the data is all on-chain), and all functionality could be maintained.  The API at some point could even be hosted within Ergo Explorer.


[02/08/2022 6:47 AM] Kurikun#6941
There are 3 instances of Ergo Explorer maintained by the Ergo Foundation.  All of the dApps on Ergo can call them, and in some cases it may get overly congested.   This article describes what happened for ErgoDex: https://ergodex.medium.com/reasons-of-network-issues-on-january-28th-20113ef960a5.  It may be fine as a POC to call Ergo Explorer, but as a commercial app if it ever evolves to that the name service should have it's own Explorer database, imo


[02/08/2022 6:51 AM] Kurikun#6941
Just as an aside, this is not my project.  I think @Adoo signed up for it and he's probably thinking, "Who TF are these people and why are they talking about NFTs?", lol.

I wanted to offer my opinions, and I've done that, but I don't want to walk all over Adoo's plans.  If there's some way I can contribute, I would like too, but I don't want to derail any plans that Adoo may have had for his project.


[02/08/2022 8:57 AM] Adoo#5093
Guys, I am all up for teaming up to get this done.

Summary of current contribution:
CloudScope - ergonames.com domain + Experience and learnings from Cardano ecosystem
Balb - Frontend + Partial Backend. Ownership storage is not solved yet.
6directions - Ownership storage solution using NFT.
Adoo - Scalability Lens. Business case lens.

We can get on a call to explore if we want to work together to do this! If we agree to work together, we can setup a repo, conceptualise MVP and start working towards it.

Proof-of-Work Backed Tokens
In Ergo, one token per transaction can be issued, and the token id must be the same as id of the box of the first input.  Thus if you have generated a box you know id of the future token. And this id is calculated via hashing.  Thus via iterating over a register (e.g. R4) used as a nonce, you can create a token with specific id properties, e.g. ...


[02/08/2022 2:48 PM] Adoo#5093
Thanks @glasgowm . 

POW backed NFTs can add a whole new dimension to this project. The complexity would increase multifold, so would novelty of the solution.

Benefits of POW Backed NFT
- **Novel Solution** - Really cutting edge I would say.
- **Additional Revenue Stream for Project** - In addition to tier the pricing based on how rare an Easy Address would be (fewer characters = rarer), POW backed NFT could add another dimension of how secure an Easy Address would be. If a POW backed NFT has more leading 0s, that implies a higher 'quality' of Address. Reproducing something similar would take more resources.
- **Additional Revenue Stream for Miners** - While minting a new Easy Address NFT, users can specify their target quality (aka difficulty) and be priced accordingly (higher NFT fees + Miner fees for higher quality NFTs). Miners would have an incentive to dedicate resources towards minting these NFTs.

Disadvantages
- The complexity of MVP would increase 3x. We would need (i) Smart contract solution for POW Based NFT, (ii) frontend changes for taking quality inputs while minting NFTs and (iii) a way to communicate miner incentives to miner community. Solving for (iii) would be highly complex.
- Besides quality, I am not sure if POW Backed NFT solves any other problem. Maybe Spam control.

[02/09/2022 6:45 PM] Armeanio#0321
This had been in motion for a while. I hope nobody has hard feelings.

 Open source development can mean joint progress. I am a big advocate of competing solutions. I hope you all still build.


[02/09/2022 6:46 PM] Armeanio#0321
I think in the name space we are still pretty green, a lot of innovative solutions to explore.


[02/09/2022 6:51 PM] Adoo#5093
I would like to proceed with POC - In the spirit of learning and hopefully creating something useful.

If anyone feels that we should pivot, all ears for hearing ideas.

Regarding EF partnership and conflict with EH 3 ideas, things could have been done better. Selecting ideas which conflict with current or future partnerships might not be best for developer community and / or EF partners. Slightly demotivating as a participant.

We are where we are. It's okay. I say - we build. We will undwrstand if we can function well as team. Could be a good platform for future projects.


[02/09/2022 6:53 PM] Kurikun#6941
It all depends on how the Ergo Foundation handles this.  If ADAHandle is the "blessed solution" from EF and any other solutions are like "hey, whatever, knock yourselves out guys" then how is that in any way balanced?


[02/09/2022 6:54 PM] Kurikun#6941
Creating winners just knocks out any development you want to encourage on your platform.


[02/09/2022 7:02 PM] lgd#5847
I think showing support and promoting awareness of projects is fine, but making business deals with third-party projects building on Ergo is another. Is this within the purpose of EF? Tbh I didn't think it was. Interesting question for the future though.


[02/09/2022 7:09 PM] NoahErgo#4349
Creating partnerships is well within the goals of the Ergo Foundation


[02/09/2022 7:10 PM] lgd#5847
Maybe the types of partnerships should be more clearly defined.


[02/09/2022 7:14 PM] Armeanio#0321
I don't want to pick winners and losers. 

Any project that builds open source solutions can leverage the Ergo Foundation for our support.


[02/09/2022 7:15 PM] Armeanio#0321
That has been the ask on our side, build open source and we will do what we can to support your project.


[02/09/2022 7:17 PM] Armeanio#0321
There isn't any official business partership here other than support for open development, I would be happy to give your project equal coverage. 

I just have been trying to help find a solution for the NFT scams in the ecosystem.


[02/09/2022 7:22 PM] Armeanio#0321
My recommendation is build. Unique solutions and use cases within this area are still yet to be discovered/implemented. 

As the ecosystem develops I think we will see a lot of competing solutions Dexes, Defi Platforms, NFT dApps. 

I think there is ample room for unique solutions and would be happy to support your project if you build open source. That has been my only ask for my support.


[02/09/2022 7:27 PM] Kurikun#6941
>> I just have been trying to help find a solution for the NFT scams in the ecosystem. 
If you want to do this, just implement policyId as they have on Cardano.  This is the single biggest hinderance for making a flourishing NFT system on Ergo, imo.

Currently there is no easy way for a collection of NFTs to be viewed as a collection.


[02/09/2022 7:28 PM] Armeanio#0321
I agree. This type of solution is needed and would solve a lot of issues.


[02/09/2022 7:30 PM] lgd#5847
Their blog post made it seem more official than it is, as though it was some kind of legal deal/partnership. I think that's what would worry projects and where the confusion came from. Obviously just helping and giving advice is different, like you said, you would do that for any project that decides to be open on Ergo.


[02/09/2022 7:33 PM] Armeanio#0321

Personally, I really want to remain neutral and try to encourage good development practices, not pick any winners and losers.

Competition between projects will come, but I do think that each can find unique solutions that benefit the users.


[02/09/2022 7:38 PM] Armeanio#0321
I apologize if you guys feel rugged, unsupported or have lost some motivation, it really was not my intent here.


[02/09/2022 8:33 PM] 6directions#1089
I'm in to proceed with discussions and potential POC. If it goes somewhere, cool. If it doesn't, might be worth it in the spirit of learning.


[02/09/2022 8:44 PM] 6directions#1089
If I may, what does a "partnership" entail in this case? Are you at liberty to say? I'm genuinely curious since the verbiage of the post painted a picture in my mind of something more than just promotion of a team who, in all fairness, is pursuing a very neat and practical solution.

[02/09/2022 9:08 PM] Armeanio#0321
I told their team if they build open source to help facilitate any partnerships in the community I could make an introduction. 

If they participate in the weekly community update I make videos weekly. 

Also we are a community that often has  pretty open community development so if there are issues and questions feel free to ask. 

We are in the early stages of working on a developer driven DAO for tooling, pattern design, etc and when that comes to life they are welcome to participate.

**Meeting Minutes**

- @6directions's demo - 
   EasyName -> Holding Address Resolver is working.
   EasyName NFT Counterfeit Checker is working.
   Assumption - All EasyNFT would be minted from same address.
   Converting to Javascript library is possible for fast-tracking Nautilus integration.
- @Balb's demo -
   Frontend is somewhat done.
   Ergo Assembler based NFT minting flow. 
      Step 1 - Take User Inputs
      Step 2 - Generate Smart Contract Address and wait for Erg to be received
      Step 3 - Erg transaction can be done through DApp connector or from the wallet
      Step 4 - Smart Contract will either mint NFT or return the (funds - tx fee).
   Each NFT minting address would be different if Ergo Assembler is used.
   Appkit based solution can allow for same minting address for each NFT.

@capt_nemo - We are brainstorming on how to create connector between ergo-dns and existing wallets. There are two ways in which we can connect with Nautilus.

1. ergo-dns would be a separate webservice. We connect to Nautilus using DApp connector after resolution happens.
2. Inbuilt functionality in Nautilus for ergo name resolution.

We would like to go for option 2. Would it be possible? We are happy to provide help for such type of integration. Let us know.

[02/12/2022 12:54 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Hi, sure thing, option 2 seems to be a more assertive choice for UX, I'm glad to help with that! Please give me more details on the integration, it will be an api for name resolution?

Feel free to DM me if necessary


[02/12/2022 2:19 PM] 6directions#1089
Not at the moment but really appreciate you offering. We have a working POC for token authenticity verification, and address resolution (figuring out address of token holder by token name) that manages to do it without using contracts, but by querying the ergo explorer API instead.

But have started thinking of a way to leverage simple contracts to ultimately achieve the same thing.


[02/12/2022 2:25 PM] 6directions#1089
That is one option. We provide an API that can be queried with an NFT name, and it returns the wallet address of the holder _if_ it's an NFT we have issued.

Another option would be, we could provide a JS library that Nautilus can consume to resolve name of NFT minted by our service (if it exists) to wallet address.


[02/12/2022 2:33 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Sounds great, any of these options works for me, that is up to you )

{Reactions}

[02/12/2022 2:35 PM] 6directions#1089
Awesome! Will continue to discuss amongst ourselves but think we were leaning towards API approach to begin with.


[02/12/2022 2:37 PM] 6directions#1089
We could get it out the soonest, and if we choose to provide address resolution libraries for later use, upgrade from API to consuming library should be seamless.


[02/12/2022 2:38 PM] capt_nemo#3204
How are you guys handling possible conflicts with another services? Are you using a specific naming pattern? eg, AdaHandle uses $handle, ens uses handle.eth and so on

[02/12/2022 2:54 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Looks very good! This way a wallet can easily determine from what naming system it can try to resolve the name


[02/12/2022 7:06 PM] 6directions#1089
Hello. So actually we do have some contract related questions now 😅 .


[02/12/2022 7:12 PM] 6directions#1089
if you mint NFTs in different txs, say using a node wallet or via node REST API, every NFT will have different token id, but same "artist identity" as defined in EIP-0024 (in essence, same mint address).
https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/blob/master/eip-0024.md#artist-identity

Is it possible to have a "minting contract" with similar properties? Namely, same contract address for every NFT minted? The idea/hope is to be able to use mint contract address to verify "artist identity" (token authenticity) instead of address of wallet used to submit mint tx.

My initial assumption is that no? Because every time contract is compiled, if at least 1 contract input is different, then it will yield a different contract address. But wanted to ask you in case it is possible and I'm just not aware.

[02/12/2022 7:26 PM] 6directions#1089
Mmm... Though I suppose even if contract is used to mint, some wallet still has to initiate and submit the mint tx to the network, right?

Because sending funds to a contract address doesn't automatically trigger a mint even if all conditions are met, right? Boxes at contract address have to be spent, and to spend a box, someone has to submit a tx to a node... In which case, there would always be an address that provided the inputs to the mint tx.


[02/12/2022 7:53 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Maybe the best way to do this is to have a script that checks two things:

- OUTPUTS(0).tokens._1 == SELF.id && OUTPUTS(0).tokens._2 == 1
- OUTPUTS(0) is a valid NFT box according to EIP-0004, and it has some tag that lets you have a specific contract address. Maybe check if R4 is prefixed with "ERGO-DNS"?

Now you can say a given NFT is valid if it was minted at the contract address.


[02/12/2022 7:58 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
If you structure the contract correctly, you could have a backend that can listen for new boxes at the contract address and then send and sign them. That way it could essentially be "automatic" for the end user.


[02/12/2022 7:58 PM] 6directions#1089
Yes! Cool that you say that, it recently occurred to me too


[02/12/2022 8:00 PM] 6directions#1089
in this case, what would prevent a bad actor from providing an output box with whatever tag we use, and minting nfts with our contract?


[02/12/2022 8:01 PM] 6directions#1089
> OUTPUTS(0) is a valid NFT box according to EIP-0004
would it be this part?


[02/12/2022 8:02 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
It would be on you to check if a given NFT was minted at the address. Anybody can make an NFT that says "ERGO-DNS" in front of it, so you will have to check to make sure that the tx that minted the NFT had the correct contract in INPUTS(0)


[02/12/2022 8:02 PM] 6directions#1089
ah yes, ok


[02/12/2022 8:03 PM] 6directions#1089
to take it a step further, can the contract itself check for something like
INPUTS(0).propositionBytes == mintAddressPubKey ?


[02/12/2022 8:04 PM] 6directions#1089
if not, this would suffice


[02/12/2022 8:05 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
By mintAddress you mean the contract address or the address of whoever sent funds to the contract?


[02/12/2022 8:05 PM] 6directions#1089
ah crap I see what you mean


[02/12/2022 8:06 PM] 6directions#1089
I was thinking the address that submitted the mint tx


[02/12/2022 8:06 PM] 6directions#1089
which would be the address of a wallet we control


[02/12/2022 8:08 PM] 6directions#1089
so people can send boxes to the contract address, and then our backend has to pick them up, sign a tx and submit it.
how could the contract also check that the address that signed the tx is us?


[02/12/2022 8:09 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Store your pubKey as a constant SigmaProp in the script. Then add `&& pubKey` to the end of the contract. Only you guys would be able to sign minting transactions then.


[02/12/2022 8:12 PM] 6directions#1089
awesome. thanks a lot. will test this out.


[02/12/2022 9:42 PM] 6directions#1089
Been thinking about this and there's one detail I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around.

There can be many boxes at a contract address.

When we first we create the contract address, there will be a box at that address with a script that basically says "only ergo dns dApp can spend this box". Ok, great.

But what about boxes with funds that users may send to the contract address? Those boxes aren't guaranteed to have the contract preventing them from being spent by someone else... So what prevents anyone from scanning for boxes at the contract address and spending funds that users sent?


[02/12/2022 9:44 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Once ERG is sent to an output box under an address, it is protected by the contract at that address. Once they send the ERG there, the only way to get it out would be for you guys to sign the tx that makes the NFT.


[02/12/2022 9:45 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
You can't have boxes with different scripts under the same address


[02/12/2022 9:45 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Because essentially the contract is the address.


[02/12/2022 9:47 PM] 6directions#1089
I see... Oof, okay thanks for clearing that up. My head started to spin just thinking about it 😵‍💫.

So basically whatever output box a user sends to a contract address becomes "guarded" by the script of that address


[02/12/2022 9:50 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Yeah exactly. Think of an address as a way to show all unspent boxes protected by a certain script/contract. For a P2PK address used in wallets, that contract is just `pk`

(we have been going back and worth over the last week in DMs)


[02/13/2022 6:11 PM] 6directions#1089
@Cheese Enthusiast : if someone sends a new box/unspent output to a contract address without including information about the sender's address in the registers, is there a way for the contract to check who created that box?

In the explorer, I can look at the transaction and look at the address that provided the input(s). But is there a way to "natively" check for this from within a script?


[02/13/2022 6:18 PM] 6directions#1089
This is ultimately what I'm thinking about: say someone randomly sends funds to a contract address (in our case, a minting contract), but does not include the expected register data for the contract to evaluate to true.

When we go to try and spend that box with the intention of minting an asset, we wouldn't be able to spend it, so we'd wanna return the funds to the user since we don't want to just leave the funds sitting at the contract address. But how to tell the address to issue the refund?

If not possible to check that within the context of a script (again, without the data having been provide in the registers), would we have to have some off chain logic that looks up the tx where the funds were sent, and check the address that provided the inputs to the tx?


[02/13/2022 6:46 PM] MGpai#4313
Yes thank you!


[02/13/2022 6:57 PM] kushti#0978
Anyone can create a box, they only way to authincate it before sending is to include a signature for some message, which can be checked offchain or via a contract, there are examples for such a contract


[02/13/2022 6:58 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I guess this is a matter of what is most important to the design. You could set the pk as a constant in the script, but then each contract address would be different for each person. If that won't work with your design then you could pass their pk in as a context variable, but I imagine that that would have the same problem as using a register, there's no guarantee that it will be there.

My personal opinion is that with dApp connectors like nautilus and ergopay, most users will not have to know what "setting a register" means. Ideally, the website code and the dApp connectors should handle this stuff automatically. If someone decides to go out of their way to not follow instructions, go around the dApp connectors, and send their ERG straight to the contract address, well I'd say that's mostly their fault then 🤷‍♂️

{Reactions}
👍 

[02/13/2022 7:05 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
You could also do this by having an official refund wallet and adding `|| refundPK` to the end of your contract. But this would require off chain code to search for the correct transaction, and it is not really assured that the refund will go to the right person. Could technically be manipulated by anyone with the secret for that wallet


[02/13/2022 7:15 PM] root7Z#8699

[02/13/2022 7:35 PM] 6directions#1089
Fair and solid point.

Actually was thinking we could just build the tx for the user using the dApp connector and make sure it includes everything it needs. Hearing you echo that same thought validates that idea.


[02/13/2022 7:42 PM] 6directions#1089
The signed message approach sounds promising, going to play with that. Where could I find an example of a contract that does this?


[02/13/2022 7:44 PM] 6directions#1089
Btw, what exactly is a context variable? Are those set via dataInputs?


[02/13/2022 9:11 PM] Kurikun#6941
That's definitely in the plan... that part is coming up real soon now (rsn).

Do you have any info on how to upload an image to ipfs?  Just beginning to look in to this.  We are still finalizing on our art, but this is an example of what an nft would look like.

A background, and then the ergo name branded into the specific image jpeg as the nft


[02/13/2022 10:06 PM] MGpai#4313

[02/13/2022 10:07 PM] MGpai#4313
another long term thing could be running our own ipfs node


[02/13/2022 10:08 PM] MGpai#4313
But I suggest having it onchain


[02/13/2022 10:08 PM] MGpai#4313
rather than a link


[02/13/2022 10:08 PM] MGpai#4313
only thing is I believe the art cannot be too complex due to the data constraints


[02/13/2022 10:09 PM] Kurikun#6941

So the image itself is on-chain?  I see the link to the artwork.  Nothing happens when I click on it, but I'm sure it displays as an img when it's hooked up to the src attrib?

Would you know the max length of the register?  I'm assuming that you just compute the image data and then encode it into the appropriate register at mint?


[02/13/2022 11:22 PM] MGpai#4313
I am still a bit confused with this aspect


[02/13/2022 11:22 PM] MGpai#4313
I think it is something like 4kb


[02/13/2022 11:22 PM] MGpai#4313
But yes I compute the data and then encode it into r9


[02/13/2022 11:22 PM] MGpai#4313
@kushti could you provide some insight on the length of the register entries?


[02/14/2022 1:44 AM] 6directions#1089
I know max total box size is capped at ~4kb. Not sure if registers themselves have specific limits.


[02/14/2022 1:46 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I think kushti said it somewhere in one of the dev chats, but no limits for registers, just the entire box itself

[02/14/2022 5:19 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Nice trick, only works in browsers out of the box though. In general I would suggest to use the content register for the actual byte data, but this is not covered by eip4


[02/14/2022 5:33 AM] MGpai#4313
what do you mean `out the box`?


[02/14/2022 5:35 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
You are using data URIs, that's something working in most browsers but before I have seen it I would never had thought of supporting such stuff in the Android wallet.


[02/14/2022 5:37 AM] MGpai#4313
So what do you suggest to be inclusive?


[02/14/2022 5:41 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
At first I would have thought of using Pair of Coll(Byte) with the actual data and the data type. But the idea is the same, it would just save some space because extra encoding is not needed.
Or, suggest your solution to be added to eip4. It is a viable solution as well, but without mentioning it in eip4 it is no standard and therefore not sure if supported by an application or not


[02/14/2022 5:42 AM] MGpai#4313
hmm I like your first suggestion


[02/14/2022 5:43 AM] MGpai#4313
saving space is important as it allows for the complexity of the artwork to increase


[02/14/2022 5:44 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Yes I do also think so. And if it is part of eip4 websites can convert the data into the data uri themselves


[02/14/2022 5:44 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
But just to be sure, it is really a nice hack to get it working in existing websites. Props for that. 👍

We have created a MVP for ergo-dns service to resolve Ergo Names to the wallet addresses.

Key Features

**Registration** - Ownership of Ergo Names can be established by minting Ergo Name NFT.
**Resolution** - ergo-dns service can be used to resolve Ergo Name to Wallet Address where Ergo Name NFT currently resides.
**Transfer** - When ownership of Ergo Name NFT changes, the resolution changes automatically.

The service is fully decentralised and all the ownership data is maintained on-chain.

[02/14/2022 9:17 PM] Kurikun#6941
Currently I have this hooked up using pinata.cloud, which is one of your suggested IPFS providers.  I think this is common in the NFT spaces to have the image off-chain and on IPFS.  Our current image size is 25.4kb, which I think will be an issue for on-chain storage.


[02/14/2022 9:18 PM] MGpai#4313
Yeah it is common for it to be offchain

were still finalizing some things with the system. we're going to do a beta test on testnet first with some people in the community (ergonames wont transfer over to mainnet. just intended to test how our system handles under load and see which points are vulnerable to attack). full launch of mainnet will be a little bit after that

development is still underway. Instead of using a mint address to validate ergoname tokens we're going to use an on-chain avltree to have a list of valid tokens. this way the protocol doesn't have a centralized set of keys. just completed a mvp that allows for token minting, avltree (on chain registry) update, and a syncing engine
