Provide incentive to create half-mix boxes in ErgoMixer
I guess incentivization should be done a bit differently here. Assume that there‚Äôs some Privacy Reward Token (PRT). Then to get 1 PRT, you need to send to stealth pool, where withdrawal has additional optional contract with following conditions:   box being spent after some time only (timestamping service would be useful here) box being spent to...

Mixicles - simple private contracts on top of oracle data https://research.chain.link/mixicles.pdf . Implementation-wise, onchain part would simple, p2p offchain interaction is needed (and would be the most labor-intensive part likely)

Mixicles paper https://assets.website-files.com/5f44d690acb168953e6181f6/5fa2f1616ac1b092226b3a86_mixicles.pdf

Another simple idea to build on oracles (but offchain interaction for protocol participants is also needed) is mixicles for privacy-preserving binary options etc

Hey @soysor I'm in if that's ok with you!


[02/09/2022 12:30 PM] glasgowm#9381
I'd assumed someone had simply updated their proposal for the stealth addresses but it seems they were two separate applicants. 

@_jd_ 
@aragogi 

Were you aware of each other / are there benefits in yous teaming up? Or would you prefer to submit separately? If so I can make a second channel


[02/10/2022 10:22 AM] soysor#6001
Hey! Sorry I didn't have time to submit a proposal/work in this 

Looks like there might be others working on it though :ergo_orange:

Hi! I was not aware of @aragogi 's team.

I talked to @anon2020s about another other team, and that might be it. anon2020s believes it's a good idea to work on two implementations, one short term solution and one long term solution. Even w/two implementations doesn't mean we can't work together (esp knowledge sharing). I'm down  so Lmk.


[02/10/2022 6:02 PM] anon2020s#6116
I think we can handle this in one channel (it's up to you). I'm in contact with both teams and we can move forward with both proposals.


[02/10/2022 6:04 PM] anon2020s#6116
The proposals are a bit different and we can have both implementations at the same time.


[02/10/2022 6:23 PM] glasgowm#9381
sure that works for me thanks!

Hello @stealth-addr project team! How is it going with your development, would you provide updates?


[02/11/2022 3:20 PM] _jd_#3179
Good morning! I'll be joining in like an 1.5 hour.
I'm going to try proving it first in scastie then trying to add it to sigma-rust. I started last night but then got tired - https://scastie.scala-lang.org/zAYWa6vpQcud4TUxe4fAaA

Hi!
We developed a project to create a stealth address and scan the stealth boxes. Now we are working on embedding it into the mixer. If it works and passes all tests, in the next level mixer UI must be edited to have the stealth feature.

no limitation for your work too. fork the mixer and do what's necessary.

Could someone take a look at https://scastie.scala-lang.org/xFylblQTRrq98aCkOOxIgg I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. What tools do you use to check these maths?


[02/12/2022 2:43 AM] _jd_#3179

Please @anon2020s review when you're here


[02/12/2022 9:05 AM] anon2020s#6116
I'm looking at it now


[02/12/2022 10:07 AM] anon2020s#6116
As I can see, you're spending from Alice's stealth box to bob without proper proof. You used wallet.sign which is not a DHT proof.
I'm not familiar with scastie's syntax, but this is how it is done with appkit:
var proverBuilder = ctx.newProverBuilder()
proverBuilder = proverBuilder.withDHTData(gr, gy, ur, uy, BigInt(sk, 16).bigInteger)
val prover = proverBuilder.build()
val signedTx = prover.sign(tx)


[02/12/2022 11:58 AM] kushti#0978
I guess you need to add secrets to a prover, dunno how to do add custom secrets in the playground though cc @greenhat


[02/12/2022 1:20 PM] greenhat#6562
@_jd_ There is a single dlog secret in playground's wallet. You could extend the API and add needed methods here to add arbitrary secrets here - https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-playgrounds/blob/defae2bd4250a3ec7a721621fe565a4cd9fe650a/playground-env/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/playgroundenv/models/DummyWalletImpl.scala#L28

@stealth-addr Hello teams, how was your second day? Please provide updates from today's development, thank you


[02/12/2022 10:20 PM] aragogi#2525
Hi!
This service has different parts:
1- creating a stealth address and storing its secret
2- converting a stealth address to payable address 
3- fetching stealth pool boxes from blockchain and selecting the owned ones
4- spending the funds in stealth pool

these task are all doable in a wallet, however No3 needs storing utxo boxes in a db.
Therefore, I think it is not very suitable for a wallet. If so, No1 and No4 is not feasible too.
So, I think the best option is to provide No2 for the users.

The scenario is:
- user inputs a stealth address in the receiver's input box
- wallet generates a p2s address based on this input
- the rest is alike any other payment

Hi!
We embed our project into the mixer. Now we are testing the mixer and also working on the UI. Tomorrow I try to push the main project and our version of the mixer on GitHub and share the link with you.

No 3 can be slow on light devices also potentially

Oh this looks very cool. Interested in seeing the product/code!


[02/13/2022 4:42 AM] _jd_#3179
On my end I was able to get the scastie to work: https://scastie.scala-lang.org/x6bwPi9eRDiqX4m1cEJsNg
I've added a PR for the necessary DHTuple access on the wallet - https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-playgrounds/pull/24

Once that one lands, I could do a PR for adding it to ergo by example.

[12/16/2022 8:23 PM] soysor#6001
üëç

Currently working on an EIP to try and standardise their usage and was going to look into a plugin after that.

Is the best way to contribute to make a pr with a new monorepo package like babel? Or published separately from fleet?


[12/17/2022 1:31 AM] capt_nemo#3204
Sounds like a nice plan üôÇ

On contributing, I would be glad to accept it as an "official" plugin and maintain it, but you can of course publish it as a separate package, it's up to you.
