Keith, or Ki for short (pronounced Key). 

I've been a backend developer at my company utilizing C# focusing on graphs as a form of storage. Previously a front-end engineer for infrastructure utilizing React and React Native. Love working on system design for software. Also built a crypto price text message notifier with python. Also have knowledge in Nodejs.
Also did some project management, UX, UI, Branding and marketing on the side for the fun of it.

The circuit to access to the market capital is not easy. In the best of cases the startup can access to seed fund, and then tosuccesive rounds of investment.

[09/20/2021 9:43 PM] glasgowm#9381
I think @Chris Ray idea is to use multi-stage contracts if I'm understanding right (not on cardano)


[09/20/2021 9:48 PM] glasgowm#9381
Not sure I really understand their idea from the blurb on the site. Sounds more like they recycle the shares to spread the risk. Wheres Chris wanted to develop a trust system.

Interest-Free Loan Contract
This example is motivated by rising popularity of over-collateralized loans. BlockFi startup just raised $18M from VCs to do them. However, Ergo is more about people and small ventures doing simpler business because of simple templatized contracts.  Let‚Äôs assume that Alice has mined some Ergs. She is not willing to sell them.

Bonds based on Ergo (or the "Yield protocol")
EDIT: Full code available here.  The following idea is motivated by the paper ‚ÄúThe Yield Protocol: On-Chain Lending With Interest Rate Discovery‚Äù which uses the Ethereum model.

[09/21/2021 12:46 AM] Chris Ray#2713
So it looks like the Cardstarter loans  (LSW) are over-collateralized fashion according to their page.
The "Interest free loan contract" is also a collateralized loan option.


[09/21/2021 12:52 AM] Chris Ray#2713
And the Bonds are also collateralized.

My intent would be to remove collateral from the equation and develop a system that allows for a user to build trust, the purpose of this is to reach the unbanked that most likely do not have collateral to begin with, yet it will be made available to anyone who wishes to use it.


[09/21/2021 1:14 AM] Mehul#9729
Okay but we would require some assurance.


[09/21/2021 1:15 AM] Mehul#9729
Because we need to know the credibility of the person who is willing to borrow


[09/21/2021 1:15 AM] Chris Ray#2713
My experience in crowdsourcing funds platforms goes back further than a decade and for about 3 years I have been exploring the possibility of lending on-chain, the issue most people see is: "Where is the incentive for lenders?" the only way I can answer that is my target is along the lines ofcharity and I can assure you that some people contribute to charities often with very little tangible incentives to do so, some people might get a tax break by doing so yet generally people give often, while I do appreciate the charitable work in the world I was glad to find micro lending, I have been lending for the past 3 years at a loss which, I expected as it was very  apparent when I signed up that any loan could go into default, the default rate that affects me is 3.17% that I consider my charitable donation to the world.
My favorite site to use is kiva.org, they claim that $2.5 million a week is crowdfunded by their users.


[09/21/2021 1:24 AM] Chris Ray#2713
I am not sure about that, as part of the design of this project I am hoping we can provide a address credit system, it is most likely that no borrower will be funded based off of just requesting to use the service, reputation and community backing is what gets crowd funding projects funded.


[09/21/2021 1:28 AM] Mehul#9729
Even in the community backed lending we need to make sure the community doesn't be at lose


[09/21/2021 1:29 AM] Mehul#9729
This would effect the lending capacity of the project would decrease.


[09/21/2021 1:30 AM] Mehul#9729
So let me get this straight idea is community will back the project as a charity and with the help of the same we can help people who are willing to borrow.


[09/21/2021 1:31 AM] Mehul#9729
Am I right?


[09/21/2021 1:32 AM] Chris Ray#2713
Exactly, Multistage contracts imo would allow for funding to be completed through the initial stage of crowd sourcing funds, once a goal is met the funds would be distributed to the borrower and a transaction sent to the second contract with the data needed to put it into motion, the 2nd contract would be receiving funds from the borrower so that they could be redistributed to the lenders.


[09/21/2021 1:33 AM] Chris Ray#2713
give me a sec, brb


[09/21/2021 1:34 AM] Mehul#9729
Okay


[09/21/2021 1:50 AM] Chris Ray#2713
As I mentioned in i-need-a-team this project if built I will be able to utilize, the idea is microfunding a borrower, if the community does not know the borrower then the community likely will not want to lend to the borrower, if the community does know the borrower then they might like to lend to the borrower with faith that it will be paid back, it might be possible to add a trustee to the app which would allow for someone to sponsor an unknown borrower, in this way the trustee might also gain reputation based on whether a loan is payed back or if it defaults.


[09/21/2021 1:53 AM] Chris Ray#2713
Yes sort of as charity, yet it is not considered charity technically as a lender will be lending with the assumption that they will get their value returned by the borrower.


[09/21/2021 1:54 AM] Mehul#9729
Yes exactly we need to make that sure that they do


[09/21/2021 1:57 AM] Chris Ray#2713
I think it is the responsibility of the lender to understand the risk's and understand why they are lending.


[09/21/2021 9:01 AM] glasgowm#9381
That script above actually already has a solution built in with collateral.


[09/21/2021 3:32 PM] Chris Ray#2713
Collateral creates a barrier to entry, the people that could use the program the most generally won't have collateral to be used.

That is why a reputation/credit system is important.


[09/21/2021 3:52 PM] glasgowm#9381
you could maybe use some worthless native token and then use that as the reputation system.


[09/22/2021 1:55 AM] Chris Ray#2713
I am not sure a token is needed to track whether or not an address has fulfilled its obligation of a smart contract we just use  nano ergs, if the secondary contract is initiated by a transaction to it the address that is expected to fund such contract would be seen recorded on chain associated with that contract and if the contract does not get funded then that would also be recorded, unless I am missing something.


[09/22/2021 9:15 AM] glasgowm#9381
Just an idea as a way to track/display the trust using a point system (based on native tokens)

re-reading I missed the crowdfunding part of your idea so Raffle probably makes more sense as a base.

[09/22/2021 8:57 PM] Chris Ray#2713
@Mehul will you be able to develop a strategy for what a borrower would pay in interest to utilize the project?


[09/23/2021 1:21 AM] kii#8888
What if focusing on lending, we can focus on just crowdsourcing first. Then there is less complications. The flow would just be:

1. Fund seeker set up a campaign saying how much they need
2. People donate to that campaign. You send your erg, and it gets locked up. 
3. If it reaches that amount, then the amount is transferred. 

This way, people 
1. know they're coming into this space, knowing that they're doing charity, and they're not getting their money back
2. It's one way, so it should be more suitable for a hackathon, seems smaller scale. 
3. It can be structured so that future development can include lending.


[09/23/2021 1:25 AM] kii#8888
However, receivers will then have to consider tax and its liquidity. Considering different countries having different tax. It's gonna be an issue when the fund seeker is looking to liquidate. Then they
1. wouldnt receive as much as they thought
2. Tax might cause them more problems and what not

This brings another point,
If people were to borrow cryptocurrency, what would they be using it for? It's a good space to go into, but I'm curious to know what you guys thought about this part since tax is a monster right now to crypto holders


[09/23/2021 3:48 PM] Chris Ray#2713
I have already been able to crowd scource funds using the Ergoraffle, with a focus on lending we can move things forward, Kushti and others have put work into funding already https://ergonaut.space/en/ErgoFund

This is exactly what I went through with the raffle


[09/23/2021 3:55 PM] Chris Ray#2713
The distribution through raffle is very much similar to what we need for lending, the secondary contract that a borrower would need to fund is what our  focus should be for the credit aspect of the idea to begin, if such secondary contract is funded than the address listed as responsible to fund it gains a credit worthiness

[09/23/2021 4:00 PM] Chris Ray#2713

First Category:

Hi there, my name is Benny Asitonka-Joe, I'm 23 years old, I'm an Architect. I recently rounded up my Master's program at Rivers State University. I've been practising Architecture for a couple of years now, working as a contract staff for a few firms. 


I do animations and 3Ds with Archicad and Lumion software. Due to the recent updates from this software, running it on my laptop has been a hassle. I'm currently using an HP workstation with a 2GB dedicated graphics card, which is nowhere near the benchmark of this software. 


I've been unable to work properly because lending higher graphics laptops from friends keep slowing down my work pace, and most times the people I lend from are occupied with their jobs. This has cost me a lot, as I've lost most jobs and opportunities. 


I've been trying to raise money to get a new one, but responsibilities keep kicking in. I'm the firstborn and I've been financially supporting my mom with four other siblings ( our dad left a couple of years ago ). 


Getting this money from you would enable me to get a new laptop, and equip myself with more skills relating to my job. 


I'd attach a few of my jobs for your perusal. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

Story Highlight: 

Hello I am Adele Victory Iheanyi


I was born on the 14th of January 2003 and I am a local of Rivers state, Ikwerre precisely. 

I am a second-year mechanical engineering student of Rivers state university and I love learning and trying out new things. I also love doing business like buying and selling both online and offline.

Having financial struggles and difficulties with paying my tuition fees is posing a threat to my education... I have a single parent who works as a nursery school teacher in a private school, her income being barely enough to see me through school. The little money she tried to raise was used for my junior sister's West African Examination (WAEC). 

Presently I haven't paid my fees and I wouldn't want to stop school. In the past, I worked as a salesgirl which enabled me to raise money for my first-year clearance and tuition fees. I am sponsoring my education myself because I have the desire to go to school and be a better person to myself and my society.

I have no doubt that the world is full of people that might utilize a blockchain loan, the examples above were just a follow up to the question who might use a lending platform.


[09/24/2021 8:44 AM] kii#8888
Im concerned about scammers and also people who would abuse the system. 

What are some ways we can discouraged or prevent scammers / people from abusing the system? 

What if people borrow the money and just never return and then later on they just create another wallet. And keep rinsing and repeat.


[09/24/2021 8:50 AM] kii#8888
In the future, the development of a reputation system will help. But how much can it help?

Im imagining someone borrow funds. And one day, they‚Äôre not able to pay and have to default, then we cut points off their reputation system. Then they‚Äôd have the thought process of, since I‚Äôve already lost my reputation, might as well just default. 

What we can do in the scenario would be to give them their reputation back if they continue the payment with added interests, and if they finish paying a certain amount of funds, they get back their reputation.

Just some out loud thinking

Chris we can use this charity in different forms, I have been thinking like professionals or other people can provide charity with the help of their services too. In return the benefits of economy which will be enjoyed and can be shared with the community. I am thinking about the interest part, I was thinking as this a charity work why don't we collect the returns in the form of services instead of monetary benefits from the receiver those who can't pay. This will help the growth of community and also some additional benefits will be shared by receiver,


[09/28/2021 9:09 AM] Mehul#9729

Hi @sam.gno , i'd like to engage your interests in continuing on this project, and we can set up some time for dicussions. Is entirely fine if you ain't too, but we wanted to engage on members who are interested in moving this forward.


[09/29/2021 12:36 AM] Chris Ray#2713
I think that is also a good idea, to collect services from those that cannot afford, yet for this project it is probably a good idea to stay focused on the initial lending of Ergs with an expectation that Ergs be repayed.


[09/29/2021 12:39 AM] Chris Ray#2713
Although this will be used for charitable philanthropy it will not be restricted to it alone.


[09/29/2021 12:43 AM] Chris Ray#2713
I have this idea that it might be possible for a borrower to choose the interest rate they are willing to pay and the lender can then choose to accept that rate or simply choose not to lend, in this way a borrower could actually set the interest rate at 0% if they like.

{Reactions}
üôè üí™üèª 

[09/29/2021 1:32 AM] kii#8888
Yes. It would also be an interesting approach if the lender can decide on the amount of interest that they‚Äôd offer and the borrower can choose to accept it. Though that will actually be too complicated.

However if there exists a way where lender states that they want a minimum of n% interest rate and borrower can choose to take it on, it will give lender a bigger interest in participating


[09/29/2021 1:36 AM] Chris Ray#2713
For future development outside of this event I think it would be a good idea to have both lenders and borrowers  be able to propose a percentage rate.


[09/29/2021 1:40 AM] kii#8888
100% future. We should definitely write down the scope/requirements specifically for this hack only so that we don‚Äôt run into feature creep

I'm new to defi app and would love to learn about what's your thought process when it comes to architecting a defi app. 

Is it the correct approach to view them as:
1. Front end (includes wallet connection)
2. Rest APIS 
3. Backend System
4. Ergo Contract
5. Database

The ergo contract part would be to come up with a logic of financial transaction and then convert it into logic. Which we code into the script to be lock with the boxes.

[10/01/2021 2:08 PM] fateme.r#4033
It seems correct.
At the beginning it's better to focus on the logical design and the contracts. As your new to this concepts it may require more time.


[10/01/2021 2:35 PM] fateme.r#4033
About wallet connections I'm not sure if it is a part of the front or back, but I think you don't need wallet connection.
Instead of wallet connections it would be easier to use proxy contracts.

[10/06/2021 7:29 PM] torchTheMall#9228
slickDB appears to just be an ORM.  I think we can probably just use a supabase DB - they give you a postgres connection string


[10/07/2021 2:38 AM] Chris Ray#2713
You guys just let me know the best route to host the dApp, I will plan to figure out the hosting beyond the hackathon.

@mhs_sam @fateme.r Do you guys have time tomorrow where we can set up a group meeting to discuss about the design concept for the lending system?

I'll do a write up in here too. We'd love to have an idea discussion chat session if it's possible.


[10/08/2021 8:34 AM] kii#8888
For ergo-lend,
the flow of the funding is very similar to ergo raffles funding system, and we'd like to have something similar when it comes to the funding step. 

When a borrower instantiates a borrowing contract, lenders can put ergo into that borrowing pool and receives an IOU token with the amount they are putting as compared to the ratio of the full pool. 

When the pool is funded, the borrower can spend the box and receive the funds. A repayment box is created. This repayment box also acts as a contract between the borrower and the lenders. The borrower pays back the money by sending the erg to the wallet/payment address. When the funds reach a certain amount/height, the funds will be dispersed to the lenders based on the ratio they lended. 

(We're thinking we can get the IOUs to be pointed to the amount left, and the number left to receive from lenders can be observed)
(Where as borrowers will have get the info of how much left to pay back by referring to the repayment box.)

The process repeats till the borrowers pay back all the funds.


I'm still really new to ergo, so I may have misunderstood some concepts. Let us know what you guys think.

Hi Ki.
I've read your message and saw your jamboard.
I think the funding process is very similar to the raffles but I can't fully understand the rest scenario. What is an iou and ticket. And what's their difference.
Do you wanna pay back lenders when the whole money collected in the repayment box or repaying should be done in some steps?


[10/08/2021 4:01 PM] fateme.r#4033
I couldn't understand the first page of your jamboard. You may misunderstood the proxy contracts usage.


[10/08/2021 4:26 PM] Sabot√∏r#4937
Been away from discord for a while but this seems right up my street! Great idea


[10/08/2021 8:16 PM] kii#8888
The iou token replaces the raffle ticket as a sign that they still have money owed to them from this lending pool.

The payment ticket might not be necessary. It was a thought process on keeping the borrower accountable like both borrower and lender have a contract in a way. 

Else it could be just a payment box that borrower has to fill up and every time the box reaches a certain amount it releases the funds to the lenders.

For example, borrower has to pay back back 100 in total. But every time the value of a payment box has 10 ergs, it gets send back to its users.


[10/08/2021 8:17 PM] kii#8888
The first page was a sketch for us to visualize proxy contract, but then we haven‚Äôt revisited it yet


[10/08/2021 8:41 PM] fateme.r#4033
Then I think you may don't need the ticket. I still can't understand it's need and what do you mean by a contract between borrower and lender.

Anyway, your idea is interesting and your thoughts are following the right path.

To start working with ergo scripts you can use raffle ergo scripts in starting phases when the borrowers are funding the lender. Then you need to design the final repayment phase scripts.


[10/08/2021 8:42 PM] fateme.r#4033
Ok if you still have problems with proxy scripts lmk.


[10/08/2021 8:46 PM] kii#8888
Okay. We‚Äôll continue working on the scripts and design and once we have something more solid we‚Äôll share it

[10/09/2021 12:24 AM] torchTheMall#9228
yeah i dont follow the IOU stuff either - i think the repayment box should just fill up the way the first box does.  then the contract can divvy the fund up according to the inputs of the first lending contract


[10/09/2021 12:25 AM] torchTheMall#9228
people could go and re-pay loans as an act of goodwill


[10/09/2021 12:25 AM] torchTheMall#9228
kind of both ways


[10/09/2021 12:26 AM] torchTheMall#9228
just fill another repayment contract, after x time, take the total and split up the funds according to the initial inputs from the raffle like loan


[10/09/2021 12:26 AM] torchTheMall#9228
maybe the whole repayment is in there - maybe not


[10/09/2021 12:26 AM] torchTheMall#9228
you can track a users repayment history


[10/09/2021 12:26 AM] torchTheMall#9228
just by using the explorer i think


[10/09/2021 12:26 AM] torchTheMall#9228
and give them a credit score


[10/09/2021 12:27 AM] Chris Ray#2713
It would seem to be that the IOU would be tracked in the repayment box anyway, might be a good idea if we can track the fund amount in the repayment box and lenders could look it up on the explorer if possible as @torchTheMall points out


[10/09/2021 12:28 AM] torchTheMall#9228
yeah - i mean - whatever works for the hackathon first i would say - which it might just be simpler to do the same type of raffle contract, just in reverese


[10/09/2021 12:28 AM] Chris Ray#2713
I thik you are right there


[10/09/2021 12:28 AM] torchTheMall#9228
the nice thing about a raffle like repayment address thats public - is that you can have some people donate loans - but also go clear out loans people owe - say they are getting close to the trigger date and they couldnt pay it back


[10/09/2021 12:29 AM] torchTheMall#9228
a nice person could go fill that repayment for them


[10/09/2021 12:29 AM] torchTheMall#9228
leaves a little flexibility there


[10/09/2021 12:29 AM] torchTheMall#9228
to keep lenders coming back


[10/09/2021 12:29 AM] torchTheMall#9228
if you can fill the repayments


[10/09/2021 12:29 AM] Chris Ray#2713
I also think that the credit score should likely be focused on later and not included for this weekend.

[10/09/2021 12:34 AM] Chris Ray#2713
I was discussing exactly this with Ki last night, in this way as I see community forming around the charitable lending aspect with sponsors if someone is vouched for and comes across hard times then the sponsor can stand up for them and repay the loan if need be or make a case to others to keep someones address in good standing.

[10/09/2021 12:50 AM] kii#8888
i'm dumbing it down to just a one time payment for the hackathon. If repayment box is filled, lender gets back money. Not the best  cause if borrower does not pay back ever, then lenders never gets the erg. But its okay for now I reckon


[10/09/2021 12:54 AM] kii#8888
I also stripped out some of the mechanism from the ergo raffle like the tickets and stuff. So its super simple,

flow
1. borrowers start a funding box
2. lenders fill up funding box
3. when filled, funding box is destroyed and creates an empty repayment box (with lenders pk and how much they lended) and also ergs to borrower
4. Borrower fill the repayment box, when repayment box is filed, it repays everything to lenders based on how much they donated.


[10/09/2021 1:02 AM] kii#8888
@fateme.r @mhs_sam , I'm looking at the raffle code, and I noticed that when a proxy contract is created, they send a payment address to the user who's trying to create a raffle. 

Can you verify if my understanding is correct:

When the user pays to the payment address, it essentially creates a new box at the payment address with the proxyContract binded to it.


[10/09/2021 1:20 AM] Chris Ray#2713
This will work as this contract relies heavily on community accountability and is meant to be used as charitable philanthropy, kind of brings a human aspect to blockchain solutions.


[10/09/2021 1:23 AM] torchTheMall#9228
yeah this seems like the way to go


[10/09/2021 1:23 AM] kii#8888
It seems like the service box may be a box that has to be created before hand.

[10/09/2021 4:58 AM] fateme.r#4033
Yes it's correct


[10/09/2021 5:25 AM] kii#8888
Would you guys describe ergo boxes and transactions as like this:

What goes in, must come out the same. 

2 boxes can output with 3 boxes, if the value of erg is the same
1 boxes can output to 1 boxes, if the value of input and output is the same
2 boxes can output 1 box, if the value of input and output is the same

Smart contracts works in a way where the if any of the contracts does not equal true. The whole process fails, because the output would not be the same then. Thus resulting in an transaction that cannot be processed.

Because the first rule of UTXO is what goes in must come out the same.

Just like how energy is not lost, just transferred


[10/09/2021 5:49 AM] fateme.r#4033
yes its true, but the contracts also can check more rules than only the UTXO rule. If you wanna spend a box in a transaction then its contract should be satisfied.

{Reactions}
ergo_orange 

[10/09/2021 6:07 AM] kii#8888
Oh, To spend a box, it has to satisfy those conditions


[10/09/2021 6:08 AM] kii#8888
A transaction essentially spends all the box, and to spend it, all the requirements must be satisfied


[10/09/2021 6:08 AM] kii#8888
apologize for the noob questions


[10/09/2021 7:02 AM] kii#8888
When you say more rules, what do you mean. Are there documentation for it?


[10/09/2021 7:07 AM] fateme.r#4033
I didn't mean more essential rules. The only primary rule is the UTXO rule you have mentioned. It means that no Ergs can be created or burnt in a transaction.
But its not all, we write the scripts to include more rules to the boxes. to create what we wanna create. For example a raffle box in funding phase can only be spent if a same raffle box with more value is created. it's a rule in that special box.


[10/09/2021 7:10 AM] fateme.r#4033
As you said it would be better not using the *rule* world. We wanna add some conditions in the boxes, Then all conditions must be satisfied in the spending transaction.

[10/13/2021 2:32 AM] kii#8888
Hi. For the project, there‚Äôs actually 2 layers to it. One is the tech and the second is the community. We‚Äôve partnered with field managers from Africa so that they can ensure the credibility of borrowers.

Hey there. Is this project going to support flash loans?


[10/13/2021 7:18 AM] Chris Ray#2713
I think that the design of flash loans is outside of our scope.


[10/13/2021 7:35 AM] Chris Ray#2713
The project is not for donations, it is for lending, there is already a great tool that can be utilized on Ergo if someone is looking strictly to donate - see Ergo Raffle.
https://beta.ergoraffle.com/

Loss prevention will be done as it has been done for thousands of years of uncollateralized lending, this concept of reintroducing it through a blockchain tool might seem very foreign and difficult to understand yet we aim to create a bridge between this new technology and the communities that would like to utilize it yet have little to no means of revenue to allow them to participate, our co-founder/field partner is in the process of structuring a pilot program that will serve as 1 example of how communities can engage with this format of borrowing  to ensure that charitable lenders can have a high expectation of repayment.

Yes very similar, there are going to be some noticeable differences as the community develops and likely one of the biggest differences is ErgoLend will enable P2P lending, also lenders will be able to receive an interest rate for lending which if ErgoLend is utilized for charitable lending then this will assist in balancing for losses of the likes that are seen on kiva.

You need to check your msgs and re-sign in. If youre doing it on a phone thats probably whats causing you issues


[11/30/2021 1:11 PM] essaias#5787
I left and rejoined using the above link. 
I get a popup asking me to verify. It takes me to that channel. 
I press the bug and it is deselected 1 second later.
I get no message from dyno, althouh it can message me and I can message it (no DMs blocked...)

As 2021 closes and a new year begins I would like to thank everyone that has supported this effort to provide a microlending solution to those in the world that most need it, special thanx go out to @kii and @torchTheMall for joining the Ergo ecosystem and bringing the fire that is needed to bring the change we all look forward to, the 2 of you are doing some awesome things and I am proud to be associated with you.
I wish everyone a Happy New Year!
I look forward to the growth of the Ergo ecosystem as we all work toward a common goal seeking the best route to decentralize participation in trade and finance, let's bring some heat in 2022, and lets do it loud and proud!

What‚Äôs happening with ergo-lend? Seems little news of late


[02/17/2022 12:32 AM] Hache#0857
I just wanted to know that, is there a lend project working on ergo?


[02/17/2022 12:41 AM] glasgowm#9381
In development. Updates provided in #core and on their server


[02/17/2022 7:03 AM] Chris Ray#2713
Single lender ERG contracts are in testing and review for security, the contracts work, a borrower can initiate a request for a loan and the process of lending and repayment can be completed.
Work will begin on single lender SigUSD contracts.
I meet weekly with a team in Kenya to develop a program lenders can borrow funds to and a field partner in Nigeria is working toward structuring their own program to deliver the option to their community, I am also seeking to develop other communities 
in other areas.
I am also working towards developing pathways to give lenders confidence to lend by exploring tokenomics of a lending DAO and am in touch with someone that has assured me loans could be insured.


[02/17/2022 7:13 AM] Chris Ray#2713
There are many facets to cover to be sure ErgoLend is a success and as development moves forward on the contracts and the UI, the use of the platform will begin to become more clear and integration with existing financial institutions will be more likely as an option than they are today with no successful funding or repayments made as of yet.


[02/17/2022 7:14 AM] Chris Ray#2713
See the above


[02/17/2022 12:49 PM] kii#8888
@Chris Ray thanks for clarifying


[02/17/2022 8:33 PM] abchris#8522
The insurance component sounds like a good fit for decentralised insurance. Generally the issue is always related to off-chain aspects and data, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.


[02/18/2022 12:55 AM] Chris Ray#2713
For sure, I won't engage initially if the insurance option does not meet my narrow idea's of decentralizing the tools I am identified as being involved with, however... even traditional means of insurance would be a huge benefit to lenders that would like to make investments using SigUSD and have a guarantee of a ROI worth reinvesting.

Hi üòäüòä

Is there amy way I can get a loan in usdt against my ERG‚Äôs as collateral?


[02/23/2022 3:59 AM] Chris Ray#2713
Maybe down the road, not at this time though, collateral lending is on our dashboard, however we will first incorporate SigUSD, I think the ErgoDex will help to facilitate some swaps to allow you to exchange SigUSD to use to an asset interchangable with USDT. stay tuned.

Yes, future development is possible for this, also considering a lender forgiveness program so that loans do not need to be repaid if the lender agree's.

The concept of individualized is something I like cause the DeFi branch of Lender pools can utilize this approach and allow for other projects coming into our ecosystem to safely lock their treasury into a fund that can be borrowed out and increase the treasury value - in theory.

With the Lend dApp in testing and almost ready to be used to solve some real problems in the world I am ready to to begin supporting another group of people somewhere in the world to get ready to use ErgoLend as a source for microfinance or philanthropy - so if anyone has some idea's or knows of anyone that is willing to put some effort into such a project please let me know.

[04/05/2022 9:13 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
> *(re @Joseph)*: I was asking if you are launching an ErgoLend ... 
Yes, as ErgoLend turns the project over to the Ergo community a governance token will be distributed by Ergopad, this distribution will  create a DAO of the project and allow for the project to expand and grow in the same direction as Ergo and will create a defi tool resistant to centralized control and give the community opportunity to guide the resources of the DAO to further strengthen the foundation of the ideas Ergo is built on, those ideas can be found in the Ergo manifesto released last year and they build upon a decade of exploration and observation of decentralization and how to integrate the best practices of first principles in the ecosystem to obtain the best possible results.


[04/05/2022 9:22 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
It is more than just a token launch as those that participate in the DAO will find out, the project will stand as another testimony to the strength that decentralized solutions can provide to the common person, and I personally hope it will serve as inspiration for others to build such tools that can be used around the globe.

I really like the concept of a dao. I think it is the future of company structure. I want to utilize the technology myself to have some community owned corporation. But the main challenge I have is educating people and myself on how to get things organized and what is legally possible.


[04/15/2022 6:35 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
> Haskell_plus re @gnuion: I really like the concept of a dao. I think it... 
 
 My whole life I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to observe how a Corporation set up for a good cause has been operated, it was done very similar to how members of a DAO might operate, this was done before the idea of DAOs and so the voting was structured manually and policy recorded in bylaws, the mission of the Corporation had to be maintained during its operations and this protected it from morphing into something to benefit those voted into Officer positions, the Contributers - all of them - knew that varying from the mission and goals would be cause for someone to take their place and the policy's would assist in their rights to be removed in whatever position they held to control the DAO, one aspect that has driven its success imo is a mutual respect amongst its members as they work toward the same goals  - it is still a functioning Corporation after 40 -50 years

I see a lot of benefit in like minded cooperation to achieve something, they say - many hands can make a heavy load light, one of my favorite Authors is Jocko Willinks, in his books he gives perfect examples of decentralized leadership working very well and in very complicated situations, although his examples do not cover the practice in a truly decentralized environment he does demonstrates how effective it is to support major institutions and the reality of failure if it does not get used at some point - my biggest takeaway was that we all have practiced or participated in this form of leadership in some way whether or not we knew it at the time.

Whether it is the future or not is neither - here nor there - 
It can be used effectively to create corruption resistant organizations, as this DAO forms it is important that it maintain its goals and mission and not be subject to the powers of one that could possibly develop selfish wants and neg <clipped message>

[04/15/2022 9:03 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
The definition of a DAO https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization
although describes encoded governance on a blockchain does not exclude participation of members to ensure that the governance model is followed and actually refers to just such as a requirement without detailing it to be so, this creates a very difficult selection process of the members that are given the ability to guide a dao according to it's intended mission, the closest example of an organization or rather a group of people that I can use as an example of translating off-chain information to guide on chain decisions would be the Ergo Community and associated supporters, for the most part from what I can see from my perspective is the development surrounding the chain and ecosytem is in support of the Ergo Manifesto by those involved, which also through community adoption of such is guiding the path forward as research and development continues to use the best information available, this is not on-chain decisions yet is being translated into such by those that are supported by the ecosystem to do so and then is supported by on-chain votes in a transparent matter for all to see.

[04/15/2022 9:04 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
That said, it ought be known ErgoLend will practice this model of translation by adopting the values of the ergo manifesto into the mission statement it will be guided by, and within the dao the identified contributing members will be expected to guide the organization in accordance with the values of the document, yet not to be limited to further develop the philosophy and description of what the original document encompasses and translate that into supporting materials as long as they are not in conflict with the original on a fundamental basis of the message and the ethos it has been derived from considering the history and the intentions of such writings.

 No it is not for profit and it is a private.


[04/15/2022 9:38 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
> Haskell_plus re @Ile: Is the token for governance or profit sharing ... 
 
 For the most part the token is intended to be a governance token to seek a broader reach of global opinion concerning the operations of the dao and the direction it should take according to its mission and intentions, as a governance token I think it would reflect a stake in the dao and its success or failures both.


[04/15/2022 9:39 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
I guess the culture of staying true to the mission is the decisive factor. 

If someone buys power, or populates positions of power with an intent to steer away from the mission, then people can just walk away and re-establish the system. The buyer might still have some tech or infra (most opensource anyway), but without workers, customers and other stakeholders, it will be a terrible investment. So that would encourage token ownership of people who align with the mission. 

Then the question is how to best foster the culture. And make sure that people would actually punish the misalignment. I think often users in crypto/tech would actually not make the effort to switch the service, if the previous already has the network effect.


[04/15/2022 9:57 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
Buying power or populating positions of power is a real problem we must consider and is why  I think it is difficult to name and identify the curators of the off-chain operations and it is important to have a process of submitting proposal's for change that can be guarded by the contributors that should have a history that can be referred to that is in support of the direction the dao is meant to take, initially this will not be a problem as anyone who joins the dao will know who is involved and by joining in a sense they are in support of the curators and the project, only initially though, the problem comes through expansion and growth and should be one of the first problems the organization should have listed to form procedures for.


[04/15/2022 9:58 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
Should note real quick that I could form procedures, but then if it something I do alone I could have called this the dao of Chris,lol


[04/15/2022 10:00 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
> Vesi Hiisi re @Haskell_plus: Buying power or populating positions of power ... 
 
 Yeah. Having the contribution history playing a role is a good idea. 

Also, the quick buyout is just an extreme example. I think a gradual change is a more likely threat. Identifying and reversing that is even more challenging.


[04/15/2022 10:01 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
> Haskell_plus re @Ile: Yeah. Having the contribution history playing ... 
 
 I agree, I think we can look at the history of some crypto's to come to that conclusion.

 From what I have seen, just doing a token and calling it a DAO is usually not that succesful. 

The first projects have the advantage of a community that is keen to contribute. Even with that, organizing the DAO work will be important. 

Just having someone to organize the discussions, work groups and communications goes a long way.


[04/15/2022 10:05 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
So its great that you are thinking of these things beforehand.

[04/15/2022 10:23 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
Although I have taken lead to bring this to fruition and have an amazing team Keith and John working on it, a successful dao has many roles that cannot be filled by just a few people
and as you point out the first projects have an advantage of gaining community contributors and this is why we have decided not to keep this project as a team project but rather make a bigger impact in the world by allowing others to plug into it with their skills and their experience, using this approach I am very optimistic in its success outgrowing the original plans of how to drive its adoption.
It is still very exciting to be a part of this for me, and I look forward to the next couple months as it becomes more capable to support growth and others join us in pushing it forward.

 If you want to look for inspiration on good DAO practices, I suggest looking at the Gearbox protocol. 

The founders had the advantage of being well known in defi. It gathered knowledgeable supporters right at the start. The DAO pursues decentralization and knows the pitfalls very well. The quality of discussion and organization is high.

 I think land can be easily turned to a NFT because it has unique coordinates. Maybe a tiny bit of land like 1m2 and then we will but a solar panel on it.


[04/16/2022 7:32 AM] gnuion#0000

 I think the workarounds are available, I know only a couple hundred miles north of me a DAO can be registered legally and at that point nothing can really stop it from acquiring land or property here if it's all legit and follows the law of where the DAO is registered.

I can check the legal aspects of leasing land to a DAO. Will start working with a lawyer tomorrow. Could you give me a reference to a proper description of a DAO such that it would be a faithful representation of the DAO that ErgoLend would be based upon?

It would be good to have such plots in different parts of the world, if only to allow us to study how the DAO would interact with different legal systems. I can research Israel, Palestine, perhaps even Greece.

 Tbh I am hesitant to describe what my opinion is, I do not want anyone to think that my perspective is exactly what ErgoLend will be described as, these things come together with many people involved and my perspective is just one, you could get the general idea with a search and reading several different articles describing one, also a little history of NGOs helps also.

 Ergoland is where people sell land on ergo.

This is an area where branding becomes really important, because most people will view it as charity. Kiva works because they have established a really strong brand that can drive awareness. ErgoLend will need to do the same to attract capital into the system.

 Profit is not such a clear concept. You would want added value. Look at the European Central Bank, lending money with negative interest rate, just to keep the system stable somehow and encourage economy growth by making money "cheap".

 I will propose staking for governance votes to be counted, this will need to be developed, as for additional staking I see value in it for many different reasons yet that is a conversation that has not really begun yet and will most likely be addressed as soon as the treasury is formed and proposals for use of it begin to get made.

 The approach is meant to address issues and problems that code currently has not been capable of solving, if code was law today in all aspects of society how then would it look to introduce human compassion, forgiveness, or understanding into this code as a law to operate the world?

Difficult question if you ask me and I see you very much understand it.

I believe some of us have been too excited about removing the human factor from financial transactions that we overlooked what would happen by doing that, I believe that ergolend has already made a good demonstration that in some cases code as law is just not going to work 100% of the time yet, and by providing options for people to practice compassion, forgiveness and understanding we can continue exploring how to further develop tools that exclude no-one and can benefit the world using immutable secure blockchain tech, like maybe a easy to use LETS I dunno.

[04/22/2022 4:44 PM] theta_decay#0000
Honestly I'm most surprised by the expectation so many people seem to have that a guarantee of no default is even a possibility. I've never made a loan in my life where borrower default wasn't a possibility. Default is a cost of doing business for any lender, in my opinion.


[04/22/2022 6:23 PM] GroupAnonymousBot#0000
Yeah mvp is uncollateralized loans. This is not our only ambition.  If we can do a kiva.org on the blockchain we're trying to actually bank the unbanked here.  Not just doing lip service to it.  We will also make collateralized loans so we can liquidate you when you degen into yield farms.

 Some people want only guarantees and have only experienced collateralized lending, straight up not for everyone to take risks on real people, some just want number to go up as is the crypto way right, this is not number go up fuckery, this is intended to capture a real practice utilized by traditional financial institutions - and it will work.

 I like the logo cause the handshake shows an old school P2P agreement being solidified imo, as we move to complete digital transformation of the past lessons learnt and practice them with platforms like ergolend I think our past ought to be remembered, respected, and honored with such small gestures a logo is capable of delivering.


[04/25/2022 4:05 AM] shadowanswer#0000

 For sure noone should be offended, as mentioned just above in the comments rebranding will be in the works, yet rebranding and approved materials should come through proposals and adoption of those materials by the dao, even little details like this the dao should be involved in the decisions, as the team hands over control of their project to the community  this rebranding can be done by someone with marketing skills and they can be incentivized by operating funds to deliver the best product they can deliver.

 Rebranding will be fun :)
I expect many people to have an opinion on the subject and in the end I hope and pray that it reflects the values of the organization and the charitable aspect that is is the core of the project and its supporters, I can hardly wait to see who will come forward to work on it.

tokenomics are next to non-consequential and not as exciting imo, as it is ~ the token will represent the stake and claim someone has in the dao - it is a government token lets not forget - yet it is not a blockchain governance token like ADA, it is merely meant to guide the mission of the dao and incentivize those that choose to invest in the mission to propel the project forward so Lenders can realize a ROI and Borrowers have access to funds in a decentralized environment and avoid the fee's and rates of centralized institution's that are subject to corruption or misinformation.


[04/25/2022 5:16 AM] Chris Ray#0000
I think ergolend is going to have a high amount of loan request's this summer.


[04/25/2022 5:23 AM] Chris Ray#0000
which is good, the fees and rates although lower than traditional institutions will/should by volume offer supporters plenty of reason to become a larger stake holder and if also they are lenders it will allow them to not only stay on the platform in support it will also create an increase in their position which will allow them greater impact to make a difference in the world.

 Can you tell us what the benefits are holding ergolend tokens besides governance?  Will it receive some fees for facilitating the loans?  Also, I believed the DAO will also participate in loan origination which will help ergolend boost treasury.   The charity concept is good, should we view buying into ergolend as an investment or charity?  Ultimately this will affect how people think of investing into Ergolend.

 It is going to be like every other lending dao, if your not familiar with those  I would suggest getting familiar with them cause the governance token guides the organization and decides where fees go.

I‚Äôd keep the current logo, historically a handshake has been a signal of cooperation (and a lack of bad intent). Research shows that negotiations that begin with handshakes produce better outcomes for both parties. We begin ours with a digital handshake on the ergo blockchain.

I could have missed something essential in the recent Medium writeup about ErgoLend - so please correct me if I got it wrong: income from the token sale will be used to develop the platform but will give the token buyer/holder only the right to participate in the DAO - not any financial rewards. Why should there be a financial value attached to the token? Why should I invest in buying the token (I.e. building the platform) if the only rewards I am getting are related to governance?

 What a worthless gov token that would be right?
What everyone needs to understand is how gov tokens are supposed to work surrounding an organization, the holders decide the inner working of the organization, if holders want to use the DAO software to reward token holders then that is what happens


[04/26/2022 8:30 AM] Chris Ray#0000
So this is not a worthless gov token üòé


[04/26/2022 8:32 AM] Chris Ray#0000
It is meant to create the DAO, the IDO creates the treasury, the token holders then have a treasury to manage


[04/26/2022 8:36 AM] Chris Ray#0000
And if you are planning to be a participant of the DAO as a token holder, start talking about how managing the treasury should be done to fulfill the mission of the project and benefit the DAO, I have idea's and I will help setup a successful DAO, but in reality it is going to be in the hands of a lot of people.


[04/26/2022 9:01 AM] odiseus_me#0000
> odiseus_me re @Haskell_plus: What a worthless gov token that would be right... 
 
 Let me then rephrase: 
- if one just wants to profit from ErgoLend without having a say on how it is going to run or what it is going to do - forget about the token sale and just provide liquidity when you like to.
- if you would like to participate in managing the DAO in all its aspects - buy the token.
Correct?

 Basically, I think you are correct. Although someone who is heavily using the platform to profit might want to play a role in governance (e.g., to make sure he can still profit in the future or even increase his profits)

 Right now there are 2 fee's associated with the using the platform, designed to serve different purposes: 
1 to initiate a loan request on the platform a fee must be paid, this is an antispam fee to ensure that a cost is attached to attacking the dApp by bad actors - that fee goes to the treasury

2. Just as you are suggesting a fee is attached to repayment, designed to come out of the interest as a cost to ensure the platform is sustainable, this fee will also go to the treasury.

There are many things to consider when setting the fee amount's, and as nice as it would be if this could be 100% charity we have to face reality and come to grips with how to properly incentivize the DAO to allow it to operate and grow to have a larger impact in the world.

Glad you brought it.
Remember, the core team was building this as a private project/business and like other dApps and developers in our ecosystem the fee structure was meant to be the reward to keep it maintained and updated, not many charity missions can have high success rates without there being a driving incentive, volunteering and donating can become tiring and burdensome even, its my opinion that a business for good is the best business to be involved in, and they can be the most successful.

 I would like the dao to target the SME lending market also, ergolend platform could handle both, that market is expected to be over $2,900.00 billion in 2030

Our contracts are not specific to one market, they can be used for any of the lending market, and with Collateralized lending coming we will also some capture market share of known DeFi.

I was wondering which currency will be used for lending. If we lend ERGs it could bring issues for borrowers if price of ERG increases, but lending sigUSD would essentialy mean shorting ergo for lenders

 Usually its a good idea to take the option with least risk for real world investments. The profit comes from putting the money into productive use. No point in adding speculation to it. 

The currency risk is always high though. If you earn in local currency, and have debt in dollar or erg, then devaluation can be a big concern. 

Dollar still more stable and universally used, so less risky.


[04/27/2022 6:36 AM] KalloShaman#0000
Yes i agree, i cant imaging for example borrowing ERG and buying car with risk of ERGo doubling the price...but with ergs i currently own i wouldnt like to essentialy sell them with interest


[04/27/2022 6:47 AM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
It might be a good idea to come up with ways to put the currency risk on the lender. They probably have an advantage in financial literacy, which makes it more fair. Let the borrower focus on the productive stuff safely. 

For the collateralized lending it does not matter. Those will mainly go to speculation, so the lenders and borrowers are on equal footing.

[04/28/2022 7:26 AM] Manishlili#0000
1. Since ergolend is a high risk project as described in litepaper, the exle token's main job is gov and dao management?
2. A high profit way exle can achieve is that the project has great success and someone want to paticipate in the dao by buy a large amount of exle? 
3. Another profit for the exle holder is to reward exle token holders for manage of the ergolend project as monthly salary? And the profit should be destribute by exle holder's token amount? This can be consider as shareholder dividends ?
4. Lender participate in the project will receive a little amount of profit since this is a philanthropic vision lend projectÔºü
5. Profit that may use as reward or dao development is come from both another little share of lender profit and collateralized lending profit since there will also be collateralized lending in the future?

[04/28/2022 2:54 PM] ChrisHobotnica#0000
Ultimately the DAO will decide on a lot of parameters relating to: fees, treasury management and distributions, products offered, R&D - you‚Äôre buying into a beautiful experiment for a genuinely needed alternative to centralised lending services.


[04/28/2022 3:51 PM] GroupAnonymousBot#0000
yes, the market for ergo lend - which we decided this week to narrow to tackle payday loans and loans meant to help folks run/start businesses in a more philanthropic way.  We think that this is the most fair way to launch our token so it's very clear what the mission is.

Banking unbanked folks, and cutting down on the exploitive payday loans is a profit making business. 

The lite paper lays out the mission - but it is our goal to make a token that will reward holders with incentives.  We have many ideas around how to use the token for burning, staking and profit sharing incentives.

Developers propose a path of development with options, the community votes on it.
Other developers have the ability to bring development to the table, they propose such and the dao votes on it.

Developers propose... 
 
 But it is actually an interesting question. Is this how DAO is defined? 

How about no developers. Just a community. Then someone contributes an improvement, and the community adopts it or not. Wouldn't that be even more decentralized than a team taking the lead? (And community expecting someone to take lead)

The form is of course depending a lot on the project. Your description allows for better development. But maybe the definition is looser than that?

 I believe the adoption of policy and recorded like a smart contract is dangerous, this DAO concept is new and developing, I can only do my part and listen to guys like you pushing the conversation forward, observe how DeCo forms and manages itself, take lessons learned from Cardano and Ergo (not to mention all the others I am not close to) and apply the best practices through proposals

 Thought more about eliminating the human involvement part. 

I think it depends on the scale of the system. Economy runs on trust. Whether it is trust in the invisible hand, regulations, code or personal trust, all those make it possible to trust more, invest and prosper. 

What is not happening currently is leveraging the personal trust. You can exchange that for the global rules. For example in Ergolend, full trust would allow you to skip all middlemen and do the loan directly. 

In a global system, like the collateralized lending, the personal trust is substituted to trust in the code. Here I believe the code should strive to become immutable, outside human governance. (At development phase gov is acceptable). 

People can't run global systems. Too complex. Better to have the rules as unchangeable as possible, so people can count on them. 

DAOs are then somewhere inbetween. You don't have full personal trust, but giving the team some trust can get dev and business done much more flexibly.

 Code as a law is dangerous imo, not to say it does not have its use case currently, if rules are created as unchangeable as possible then we would slow progress of refining the complexities we are facing as we explore governance using this immutable system that is relatively new, my thoughts are build on top of a framework that is rooted in common decency and globally accepted human standards, allow for development to be capable of being reset with little work on the foundation to be done, I like to think that a good example would be scorex, although built as a blockchain solution for security protocols the same style of frameworks could apply to governance in social delicate situations, if developing rules are messed up there is a point in development to return to and apply what has been learned if so needed.

Maybe I should have just went to sleep...

Concerning DAOs though I think specific missions are important, trying to solve the worlds problems in one go is alot of work facing much opposition, an organization focusing on one subject does not have to consider all the other global issues and its participants won,t get as distracted as can be seen happening in some DAOs.

 Go sleep. The messages will be here tomorrow too üòÑ

I think this is where we might be in disagreement. I would like to see development happen through trial and error of immutable code. One version fails, try next. This evolves the code around resiliency. The "path dependency" of evolution is different, when the team can make changes.

It is a pain to always migrate instead of having a team that can upgrade. However, if we always leave backdoor for humans, then that is repeating the failures of tradfi in my view. 

Note that this applies only to the global part in my previous message. Common decency enters and is maximized on lower levels. Even here early development could be team led, but there should be a plan to get rid off it. 

I am quite alone with this view though. I had the same discussion with @Armeanio conserning sigmausd governance.

 I think we both agree that the ultimate end point should be to protect users from manipulation and potentially control. 

The question is the potential level of pain needed to get there. I would say the ideal is to have an mechanism to protect users. 

It is very hard to say how when or who controls that. Etc. 

Sigusd v2 is a good example I have a governance/update token.  

Maybe after X time? if it is proven stable I can just burn it. 

I don't want to ever use it honestly. 

Immutable code is a nice philosophical end point I agree. Free from control. 

In practice that is hard.

 Just a philosophical end point, or also in practice?

I concede that there may well be an easier path to get there. This just can't be known with the amount of data we have so far. 

I would still argue that the mode of development can dictate the outcomes. Trial and error with immutable contracts makes it clear for all that it is a risky, long and not user friendly path. 

Upgradeability does not promote that culture for the users. It still has the "protection" mindset. That might mean that the transition never comes. Certainly looks like it when looking at crypto as a whole. 

So, if a project has a goal to be immutable, then I would like to see concrete plan for it.

 Question is getting there in a way that protects users. In a way code changes with time/iteration is natural. 

It's just a potentially a very harsh path for users. Like building a boat you can't repair and with no liferafts. 

Is that worth the potential sacrifice in the pursuit of the ideal idk.

[04/29/2022 2:02 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
> Vesi Hiisi re @Armeanio: Hard question ü§î 
 
 Yeah. 

In both ways, do you actually get there? (The hard way might have hard time gaining traction)

Education strategy wise, is the soft landing better than the ideal from start? 

I feel like the middle ground with a plan to get there might be a good compromise. Depending on project and contract complexity in any case.

 Oh and the metaphor of a boat is for one project. 

The perspective is different if you look at the whole system, and would like to see at least one decentralized, trustless and resilient tool come out.

 I think this is really something worth continually pointing out.

Compartmentalizing different aspects of a project should be important, that is why specifically to ergolend I think it should build tools immutable, trustless, and decentrailized under the assumption that code is law, while other aspects of ergolend need practice upgradable policy's to evolve to support the building of the tools and supporting their use/adoption.

 Yes, I want to encourage DAO's to be built in the borrowing community's, these DAOs could operate using their own set of standards for relending funds that they borrow, yet the DAOs would be responsible for repaying the loans taken on ErgoLend.


[05/03/2022 12:53 AM] nhhchuong#0000
I see, I guess I will learn more about DAO and may try something small with paideia in near future.


[05/03/2022 1:05 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
For example
The DAO could use collateral from their treasury and lock it up in a loan agreement to have funds to work with, lets say they agree to pay 8% on the loan, the loan is for $100k, they then take the funds and charge 12% to relend it, they repay the loan and earn 4% to facilitate the process,that would be a return of $4k, with wrapped assets this will make a lot of sense as people value different assets according to their perspective (using collateralized options).
Now lets say they can turn the loan around confidently in 45 days, the investor earns $8k in 45 days, if the Lender and borrower repeats the process 8 times a year then the investor earns $64k and the DAO $32k.
I think that in some cases a DAO could get the loan turnaround down to like 21 days if you think about payday loans and SME loans, or hard money loans.

Honestly I'm not worried, Noone else has taken initiative to tackle the problems we are going after, I think borrower's will see this and use us, it's not your normal crypto approach, we look beyond the code and look to really create a difference in lending for people that need it most, to do that you need a passion to drive you to find a way to make it successful - we check that box ‚òë

The core team has been 3 people since September when it began as a private project, but the number of people bringing it to where it is now includes a lot of people I have not really put a number on, there has been a lot of developer support, community support and contributing collaborations.

I think a better question to be asked is how many people will be working on it a year from now?

Being that all this is happening online, and there's no standardized decentralized identity (DID) services seeing widespread use yet, I wonder what's in place to stop someone from

A) opening a bunch of accounts and taking out a bunch of small loans they have no intention of repaying

or

B) someone malicious with a starting amount of money taking out loans, then repaying them (not actually doing anything with the money), and taking out larger loans until it's an amount worth running off with. This could potentially be done with several wallets at once to increase the impact/funds stolen.


[05/05/2022 3:11 PM] Manishlili#0000
That is also my concern so I copy it from reddit.

Ergolend team members will never use the organization name or logo in DMs, if this does happen to anyone it is a scam!

Don not engage in DMs with anyone that uses ergolend in their profile or name!

 I don't know about anon in social chats. Tends to get dirty. I mean all anon, not just admins. This here is an interesting mix.

In governance, I think it could be a good tool. Take random sample of people who are allowed to join the gov decision. Let them talk anon. Vote. 

Better than just voting in some cases. Might be better for staying on topic and setting ego's aside compared to non-anon.

 Trusted anon is a cool position I respect.
 intentionally creating trusted anon positions in discussions is new to me.
Voting anon is different, pretty easy to understand

 I am in a country where that kind of loan also happen for local people from time to time. It is not the interest from banks but from group of people who want to take advantage of local people who don't have legal documents to borrow from bank.


[05/10/2022 10:11 AM] nhhchuong#0000
I have a concern, not about ergolend products but for people who will borrow from ergolend. What will happen to them, if the other party (who give loan with APY 700%) figure out that there is someone else is stepping in their business. I am worried for the safety of the borrower and ergolend team there.

What can we do?

Sounds like a database failure that they're going to have to manually rollback an active but blocked transaction

 actually you can do teh public seedround, even if you already submitted in staker round


[05/10/2022 8:32 PM] Iamweirdbaby#0000
Public seed round is still open and not sold out, in case anyone wants to grab some extra allocation

yes, staker seed round üôÇ


[05/10/2022 8:44 PM] ergonauts#0000
Well I knew u can but usually with the projects like paideia  there was no point for it since they sold out in early access  But in this case yeah. I mean if u want more then 9k yeah u could go for it .


[05/10/2022 8:45 PM] Iamweirdbaby#0000
not sure if it would tell me waitlist if it is waitlist allocation, but my submission went straight through and gave me the green confirmation notice , doesn anyone know if that means waitlisted or actually reserved?

 correct, but i only submitted 2k for staker allocation and just realized i could sell some pads that i am above tier as well as some paideia and ergogames and get another 1k together for ergolend. So tried to do public seed round and went through no problem

 Cool tho I think waitlist started already  at early access from what I heard

Quick Update.
Pretty good conversation with the team in Kenya today.
They will be working to put some info together to show everyone how they will use already established groups that utilize both a trust style lending within their communities and local gov registrations that allow them to take loans from legacy/traditional institutions.
Hoping they can get their own Update out over the next week to help investors understand how a loan can be backed with guarantees and also use ergolend for them to be successful and give them more flexibility than other lenders allow for.
Still developing the conversation and the path forward and we will show you all that the world needs this and we are going to be very successful if we remain on course in line with our mission.

 this is great and if there is a way to highlight this join partnership (Ergolend & WEQNT Cardano stake pool operator) in the Cardano community will help in getting this project even more exposure/supporters.  Not sure about your relationship with CH, he will support Ergolend big time and maybe comment on this project.  On the other hand, he wants this for Cardano too so maybe he will not want to highlight Ergolend.

Charles is the biggest inspiration to the roots of ergolend JCFishing he created an atmosphere of hope, to drive power to the edges, I saw it way back during protoshares when Larimer's had him involved with that project, but we are going to explode and achieve what we are working towards not by the influential mentioning the project, but by results, and everyone who holds EXLE can be a part of that, they are the catalyst that is going to drive the change, they want to see change - funded this project can do it!

 Cool‚Ä¶.I understand your take and getting more support from cardano community means ergolend will potentially have more lenders to participate in this project.  Isn‚Äôt that a good thing?  Maybe for now just focus on the immediate, Ergolend Dao.  Just thought down the road it may be a great to attract additional supporters.


[05/11/2022 4:20 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
Not only is more support from the cardano community mean more lenders but it means more support to really drive the tools of decentralized finance forward, every $ADA holder is a contributor of a DAO whether or not they know it or not, and to bring people into the ergo ecosystem and into the Exle DAO that understand this and have experience to lend to our progress will prove to be a huge step forward in our mission as they come forward to contribute to the conversation - and they will come if Exle remains on track to give power to the people that need it most.


[05/11/2022 4:27 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
Yet Cardano community is not the only community that will strengthen Exle, there are many crypto DAO's of the past and present that people are familiar with, and Exle can utilize lesson's learned from these projects and avoid some of the pitfalls of governance that are observable and recorded as we navigate community DAO's on the ergo blockchain, I think we are uniquely positioned in ergo as we have the ability to move forward with a lot of examples to learn from And we have the ability to be a programmable DAO that can adjust as we learn and expand and operate on-chain.

Since WEQNT stake pool is having a partnership with lend. Here I have some questions about WEQNT stake pool.
Where are their fund come from? Some from donation, most from staking? Part of the profit is used to help Africa?  Rest is used to maintain the DAO and distributed to the staker?
I'm just wondering what is their operational mode.

 I can't speak for Denicio but I can vouch for him, Denicio has from the start been supporting Africa with his work and WEQNT already has logged more success than ergolend to date, I will tag @ them so they can provide details if they have time for it.

 Hey Chris, always appreciate your response.  We'll do everything we can to support this project.  At times (in the future), we may have different opinions but it's good we can all share ideas to ensure this project is a success!

Do we have to do the contribution in one take or we can make multiple transactions up to the total number of whitelist tokens?

(re  : *<Nikos> Do we have to do the contribution in one take or we can make multiple transactions up to the total number of whitelist tokens?*) 
 
 You can do multiple ones but you will receive more than one vesting key then


[05/11/2022 1:27 PM] pq700#0000
you might don't want to have to many vesting keys, as you have to preform the claiming of tokens separately for each one.

 Good evenings @Manishlili 
Thank you for asking
Kindly note that our Africa operations are funded through WEQNT stake pool and donations.
Since the start of our stake pool we‚Äôve been working together with John Eyanae (who is a bishop, overseeing 25 churches in rural Kenya)
We started funding Solar lightings then went on the clean water distribution, advocating for parent sponsorship for an orphanage, educational materials for children, Solar streetlights to increase safety for women and children at night and soon slippers for the kids in the desert areas.
We‚Äôve done Solar lighting distributions also in Uganda and Ethiopia and soon in Southern Sudan as well. 
As you can see, for almost two years we have been building a strong relationship with the people in these areas (under leadership of John) - something we value very much.
As we continue to seek ways to improve lives in developing areas we believe that ErgoLend would be the best platform to help achieve this goal.
Feel free to ask any further questions. I‚Äôll be happy to answer them. 
I‚Äôll past you some links tonight with confirmations of some of our activities

 Hi @Manishlili  its really not me doing the hard work- its our team on the ground in Kenya. They are the ones who goes out into the field and find really needy people.
Also @Haskell_plus (and the team) who has given our team in Kenya something to look forward to - something we all know will change  their lives and the lives of others in the rural desert areas.
And lastly Patrick (also part of our team from Kenya). He not only understand the challenge people in the rural areas have to deal with  (especially undersupported by their government and with very poor economic perspective) but he very eager and dedicated to see his people find support and grow beyond their current economic status. Eventhough he himself is not from the rural areas, he does take their position to heart.
Im really thankful ErgoLend have seen us as a trusted party and have given us this opportunity  to expand our mission.

 profit sharing

Not in the beginning. It will be only governance token. Later people can vote for profit sharing if they want to. That's my understanding

Should be much earlier, maybe in June (my guess).  Paideia and ergogames tentatively set staking staking start date on may 31st.

[05/16/2022 7:54 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
Well priority is to build the backend for future engineers, and to allow for the project to scale effectively without rewriting everything, this will allow the devs to plug in the features they build seamlessly to my understanding, whether or not SigUSD lending is worked on in tandem and released before this is finished is going to be based on whether or not it can be done without causing more work for the engineers, nobody wants to build something twice.

Our dev team has been hard at work improving the UI, process and backend, and even onboarding. Here are a few updates from the Dev team for our future holders:
Backend:-
Implemented ->
1. Introduced ExIPs where dev proposals can be proposed for the system. https://github.com/Ergo-Lend/exips
2. Improved Developer onboarding process by introducing dockerize system and improved ergoscript development system.
3. Improved Engineering Process through modularization of project
Moving Forward (in development) ->
1. ErgoPay implementation: to improve the user experience so that user don't need to manually send funds, but can just sign a tx.
2. Performance improvement: to increase throughput for txs
3. SigmaUSD implementation: Feature to borrow and repay via sigusd
4. Improved Borrower and Loan information: Image upload, more information that borrower can provide to give lender more details on what they're contributing to and build more trust.
Frontend:
Working on:-
1. Implementing ErgoPay
2. Improving User Experience for App
3. Discussion and integration of blueprint for Borrowers to provide when setting up a loan to ensure confidence and trust between Lender and Borrower. (Partnered with Vision of Kenya team)

 Hi JC
default is not really the correct word, but it is not uncommon to see rates if 40% (and above)
@officedge went quite into details about this in the recent Twitter space (from 20 mins onward) https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1MYxNnqkrVRxw

(re @Denicio_Bernier : *Hi JC
default is not really the correct word, but it is not uncommon to see rates if 40% (and above)

 I heard this recording......most new investors or people who is doing research on this project, that will be one of the first things they ask.  How will default rate affect the overall gains for lending?  Will they lose money?  It's great that borrowers can determine the rates but if they do not get the loan, they will simply increase their rate to attract lenders.  Since this is a new market, it's hard to evaluate the risk of the loans.  Hope I'm making sense.  If the team can address this in a simpler way, why it's good to provide loan or invest in Ergolend, it will help the project long term.  As more people searching for info on ergolend, we can pin this on top so people can see the value investing in Ergolend or provide loans using the platform.

 One of the things wroth pointing out is that there will be different types of borrowers.  Some will be individuals with high risk - some will be social lending groups that have built networks of trust in a geographic region.

its a goal of ours to build tools that will manage risk and facilitate loans

 Though this could be based on wide range of uncorrelated data that mostly capture on the current predatory digital lenders across sectors within Africa (which may not have captured Kenya credit environment in particular) the target group for ergolend (vision for rular Kenya) has settled on model that has best practices for successful micro finance. Which is group based model- a peer group lending structure, which fosters mutual accountability for loans among borrowers . Because of the methodology they deflate default and still create and maintain social capital with record breaking repayment rate. Further, the peer group itself, becomes the building block to a broader social network. The social objectives of mutual self-help and poverty alleviation, remain fundamental to the broader goals of these peer group lending schemes .

IDO Announcement

Thank you so much for participating in the Exle funding rounds. During this month, the macroeconomic environment has shifted on us, and these unfortunate events have prevented many from participating as much as they‚Äôd liked. As such, the strategic round signup was not what we had hoped for, and so we have decided to burn the tokens slated for that round, rather than asking you to contribute more at this moment. . Yet, the participation that everyone has displayed from the staker and seed round did not disappoint, and it touched us deeply and really showed us what the Ergo Community stands behind: change. It showed that we, as a  community, are focused and encouraged to help make the world a better place, beginning at the grassroots level. 

Are we disappointed that we must adjust the tokenomics? Yes, due to our inability to reach the goals we have set. Yet it does not change our excitement for the community we have garnered from the previous rounds. In fact, it fuels us to work harder, and to build better tools and operate in a more lean manner. It does not change our passion, and it does not change the voice everyone has sounded through their participation. We will continue to do our best and will not disappoint.

As for the token burn, it was a tough decision for us. However, our token holder‚Äôs best interest is our top priority. Therefore, we've decided that the best move forward is to burn the tokens which increases each individual‚Äôs stake in the total supply. Your percentage will increase, while our total percentages will remain the same, to ensure that these changes are fair to all who put their faith in us by contributing to these early rounds. 

Once again, thank you for the support and passion everyone has injected into our little baby. We're excited to see what we can all achieve together as a community!

EXLE Core Team

 Some heavy hitters involved with that one, noticed that although they don't require collateral per se' they do require borrowers to stake GFI before even having access to the platform.


[05/18/2022 11:01 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
It's like a form of collateral without making it actually collateral for the loan

 Ensuring fairness is difficult, once the unsold tokens are available to be allocated to a different purpose than intended than they can cause problems within the organization.

Worth a watch. Some interesting perspectives on effective altruism, gatekeeper institutions, and systems of trust. Makes me think that Ergo-Lend will ultimately be successful if - and only if - it becomes an "institution" that people can trust with helping the lives of people. To do that, you need a healthy mix of centralized and decentralized principles, which is I think what you're going for already.

Have you guys thought about implementing some sort of digital identity into ergo-lend? Maybe something like Photochromic? Maybe that would give reassurance to lenders who are afraid borrowers might bail out on them after getting a loan?

Hey Ergonauts! We got some problems with the permissions of the offline NFTS event in Sardinia, I'm thinking to send back all the ergs of the raffle, maybe funding the ergohackfest. I'm very disappointed but I must go back on my steps because for many reasons that location in Porto Cervo is  not available anymore. I'm very sorry to have made all this mess for nothing. Please, let me know what I can do with all those ergs. I also made a little poll on tweeter to hear what the community says. Please Vote

 That's a bummer, maybe you can talk with Sam_H, this is not the first time a raffle gets funded and for some external forces it can't be delivered. A refund button after the raffle is funded would be useful

hi there, just listened to the interview with Chris on Proof of Ergo. I have a few questions, okay to ask?
1. you‚Äôre talking about loans in Africa. blockchain is anonymous though. so what do you mean when you say you‚Äôre going to focus on Africa? Does it imply local legwork of some kind? ¬†if yes, how will you ensure you have local knowledge, if you‚Äôre aiming to address local conditions somehow?
2. have you seen Aada on Cardano?
(their name is a play on Aave for cardano; but using NFT‚Äôs to represent bonds/loans). They rolled out peer-to-peer lending on test net last week. Eutxo. they don‚Äôt have any narrative about targeting any particular geography as far as i‚Äôm aware. pros/cons of that interesting to consider.

 When I mentioned targeting Africa it is cause of long standing connections already in place, we have already done extensive legwork there and plan to continue it.
Local knowledge comes from our connections and we ask them their needs and educate them how to use our platform

Everyone needs to keep in mind that  we will do our best for a smooth IDO and it is important to make sure they use the correct pool.
I have a few questions for the rest of the team before exact numbers are set, but you can expect a high number of $EXLE to be paired with a high number of $ERG


[05/24/2022 10:49 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
We will be avoiding arbitrage trading bots from causing any problems for users, so have decided to not launch a SigUSD pair to allow smooth access, this should reduce failed swaps


[05/24/2022 10:51 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
We are interested in a SigUSD pair though so we need a strategy that allows for it to be added a little later

(re @shadowanswer : *Just a question Chris. There is no staking allocation in the tokenomics, where will the rewards come from?*) 
 
 The platform has fees coded into it, necessary to prevent spam and to support development, all of this will go to the treasury and imo should be shared with token holders that vote on dao issues through a staking protocol

Remember I'm really bullish on ergo, all the fees and revenue in erg in my opinion are going to grow in value, there is no reason for the Exle treasury to get bloated, Exle holders should have a good reason to hodl.

 Half of this project is tech development and the other half is community development, serious lenders will take the time to understand who they are lending to, this is how we will be successful, a lender can build a relationship with borrowers that will last for years, and both parties will benefit from the relationship.

 Nope, I don't blame them either. Despite the projects mission, the investors are after return on their investments. Once the vesting period is over the price will stablize. It won't go lower than staker price though.

 What I don‚Äôt like about it is that the ergopad whale destroys the purpose of ergopad in the long run. If the same thing happens to ergolend as to ergogames, people will stop to invest in the presales because they know that the price will tank afterwards anyway, and it‚Äôs getting cheaper to buy in later (and without vesting)


[05/26/2022 2:16 PM] limebread#0000
Of course anyone is free to sell and make profits, it‚Äôs just the skew towards whales is build into ergopad allocation model, which I didn‚Äôt like in the first place and now I have even more reason not to like it because my fears became reality.

 Yup....Spend lots of Ergo to be able to get to a tier that allows you to buy early....OR wait and spend that ergo to buy token at same price or lower.
Perhaps the vesting release should be much longer. Or start after project has actually launched.
Challenge now is that none of the projects have launched so we don't know if they will eventually provide the return that is expected. 
So people sell to cover their initial investment. It's a sound strategy.

The whale bought ergopads and drove it to 40cents.  He/she is down close to 70-90% on ergopad investment.  It may be an investment fund as Marty mentioned but no one knows.  They may want to recoup some ergs from the projects.   They also have to balance future gain.  Ergolend in the long run will do well and they will be foolish to sell off this early in the game where market cap is minuscule.  
If this is truly a an investment fund, they will probably hold majority of the project tokens they deemed have a lot of value.

 I think he dumped some ergopads which will help stakers in the long run.   He had more than 3 sigma allocation and now 2, 3.8M ergopads.  He seems to part way with some ergolend too.....the whale is in alot of hurt right now since he bought in huge on open market.  if he's patient, will gain that back with good projects like ergolend that will do well in the future.

It's good to continue the distribution of $EXLE regardless of price, the more ergonauts that are involved in governance the better for the organization imo, centralization of the future voting needs be avoided, so the further we can spread $EXLE the better off we are

 Let‚Äôs create a DeMa (a decentralized email system) so that we could email token holders directly to their wallet (your wallet address is your email address), and so we could ask all EXLE holders not to sell, and send sellers threatening letters (or just spam them);

Something to think about moving forward though: as we seek to provide tools for the Ergo community would token holders be receptive to development funds to be joined with funds from ErgoPad and the EF to sponsor continuation of growth for DeCo?
It's highly likely future students could plug in useful tools to Exle, Something to think about

 Personally I am not in favor of anything like that, that will directly hurt the immediate and short term value of EXLE holders. Considering the bear market we are in, token holders will be further in the red with such a move. If/when we have achieved price discoveries well beyond where we are now and the initial investors are in the black to some extent, I think its more appropriate to consider. Not just from my own selfish standpoint as an investor, I think if we continue to trend into the red given the current market, all EXLE holders will not be very happy with any further price dilution to fund a project which may or may not actually build for EXLE (and ultimately lead to increased market cap which altruism aside, is most peoples main goal here). The investor sentiment can turn very sour very quickly and that can become a huge issue for any ecosystem.

 It's important to the core team to involve token holders in decisions that are made as we move forward, I asked for token holders to weigh in on compensating Tortodelivery for his contributions to what now represents the project - i heard cricket's, I didn't get a response except from him, and I really would like everyone to know that the team is very grateful that you all joined us in this effort and we want you to be included in as many decisions as is fitting, even the smol ones if possible, just pitch in with your point of view, let's get governance started now while its small decisions so we can be ready for big issues later.

For choosing a name, we could use a polling system similar to the one bees use when they swarm out of the hive and need to choose a new place to live in. A bit complex but totally democratic.

I know we're getting there and it's not ready for some time but it is not fair to token holders if decisions are made by a small group on telegram, as altruistic as our decisions may be..


[05/27/2022 2:22 PM] scotman8888#0000
We did something similar with the ergopad staking decision so this is not without precedent as they say and probably the best we have at the moment but for a project like this, governance should be number one priority

 Whether you like it or not Chris i think you are more invested in ergolend than anybody!

This is a community project and wonder if none of us sell for 1 or 10 days, where will ergolend be?  I know people have different investment philosophy but if no one sells, we will be at a much better place.  Anyone interested in this test of committing the next 3 days not selling any ergolend?

(re @Ile : *This kind of practice would make it difficult to sort scams from real projects. (Not saying you are doing a scam)

 Yes and no, this actually is how Borrower/Lender relationships will work best imo according to my vision , in 3rd channels where people can become familiar with each other and not have public pressures being applied that have no interest in the deal.
Hate to point this out tbh- yet you have shown no personal interest in the proposition and have applied an effective argument against the proposer, would you go as far to ask them to doxx themselves to provide a surety to Lenders (I know you would not, others would though)?
I think in a back channel I could ask white to provide many details about the business that would allow me to take legal action if I provide a loan and they default, it's possible a borrower will only provide those details to a trusted lender.
Funny how trust can go both ways here, I am glad this has begun, let's dig in and develop a solution that borrowers can find relief and lenders can be assured they are not getting scammed.


[05/28/2022 8:19 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
(re @white : *will do, once the project go live*) 
 
 We will implement SigUSD lending asap, I would welcome a loan request from you during that public testing, it has been decided to not release public testing for ergo loans to avoid volatility and to protect people that might not understand the impact of that volatility


[05/28/2022 8:24 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
(re @white : *basically, it‚Äôs just a poll if anyone would be willing to accept 8% 6 months. not asking anyone to commit right now*) 
 
 If you could elaborate further on the details of how you would prefer to repay the loan monthly/weekly payments etc. And how you would address reporting to your investor/investors to give them peace of mind I think that would go a long way.


[05/28/2022 8:46 AM] white#0000
(re @Haskell_plus : *If you could elaborate further on the details of how you would prefer to repay the loan monthly/weekly payments etc. And how you would address reporting to your investor/investors to give them peace of mind I think that would go a long way.*) 
 
 I didn't know ErgoLend could this be dynamic (allowing different types of  repayment structure - monthly/weekly). I don't know what other lending dynamics Ergolend could offer, best is to test it out first before I can make assumptions. When's the expected release for the sigusd lending, Chris?

What I'll be doing is a little bit ironic for ErgoLend tho‚Äîbeing a p2p lending platform. What we do here, is we also lend money to villagers (typically fishermen, farmers, and small store owners, etc). Sometimes, we are short with capital, that's why I'm planning to use ErgoLend to raise money. So, basically we are borrowing to lend.  One thing to also note is that we are not registered as a business entity. we are just lending as a 'friend' here. i don't know if anyone is up for that.

 Really good points. How to facilitate building personal trust from zero? 

I agree that public channel and one way doxxing/details is not optimal.

 You're not jaded, just the way we all to protect ourselves in crypto.  We just need to have a project like Ergolend to show there are other ways.

Respectfully, trying to manipulate price in a short time frame does nothing for the project or community.  Price rarely equals value.  If we support and build, the market will handle token price over time.  (Faint sounds of me stepping off soapbox.hahaha)

I think maybe discord might be a better platform for loan discussion, since you can have separate channels and also reply in thread. Makes it much easier to find and sort through loans than telegram where everything gets lost quickly if a lot of people are talking


[05/28/2022 4:18 PM] NoahErgo#0000
The Loan Opportunities channel could be a place where people post the loan they are seeking, and then dischssion can be in thread underneath, eventually leading to a private dm conversation

 Both of the proposals coming in from Kenya are relatively low and have high impact potential, about $5k SigUSD to fund both, A few details of the parameters of the loans need to be discussed before I am willing to open up review to others, and its a Holiday weekend here where I am so I am not working very hard.

PSA FOR TRANSPARANCY

Exle will be using the USD Oracle available for SigUSD to help decide how to make payouts for development, basically all team members will be paid out a SigUSD value per hour worked, some members have chosen to be paid in Erg and some have chosen to be paid in Erg and Exle mix (and this can fluctuate back and forth and could even come to include SigUSD) so to  make a fair calculation and moving forward today Wednesday at 6pm PT (about an hour from now) an Oracle price for Erg will be pulled and a trade value for Exle will be pulled, we will use blockheight afterward @ 5040 blocks per week to determine a weekly payout, all treasury expenditures will be based on this time frame of 5040 blocks and recorded as such for transparency.

As can been seen in the ergo weekly dev update the proxy contracts for Single Lender Token (SLT) have been worked on, we will begin a soft launch without the completed contracts, even though the Single Lender Erg (SLE) contracts are available lending volatile crypto is not ideal, so the Soft Launch will be strictly P2P
In Kenya many people are interested in what we are doing, the soft launch will allow us to begin an in practice case study that we can use as an example for other borrowing communities, also - the Kenya team is more than ready


[06/03/2022 7:59 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Could you explain the different between single lender token and single lender erg?


[06/03/2022 8:01 PM] NoahErgo#0000
and what will be used to facilitate P2P loans during soft launch?


[06/03/2022 8:08 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *Could you explain the different between single lender token and single lender erg?*) 
 
 The Single Lender Erg is basically using $ERG as payments, so the smart contracts are looking to validate whether or not ERG is being used and proper amounts are involved etc.

The Single Lender Token allows us to use SigUSD in the Smart Contracts .


[06/03/2022 8:09 PM] GroupAnonymousBot#0000
SigUsd seems like the way to go


[06/03/2022 8:09 PM] GroupAnonymousBot#0000
unless you are lending to someone that earns in erg


[06/03/2022 8:09 PM] GroupAnonymousBot#0000
maybe a miner or an nft artist


[06/03/2022 8:13 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *and what will be used to facilitate P2P loans during soft launch?*) 
 
 The Soft Launch only pertains to the social side of our development, not expecting to use a Smart Contract, the loan will be an agreement made based on trust and sponsorship and will be P2P using normal wallet transactions.


[06/03/2022 8:15 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
(re @GroupAnonymousBot : *unless you are lending to someone that earns in erg*) 
 
 I would borrow some ERG right now if someone was up for it, but yes SigUSD is the way to go to avoid volatility.

Some of the fraudulent activity to watch out for without using contracts like the SLT we will release is the possibility of Fake users in DMs, or even in public chats, I have seen all sorts of giveaways go to the wrong users cause  of scammers, so finding a way to verify the user is important, some scammers might be some of the best hackers in the world - we don't know right?


[06/05/2022 1:21 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
The front-running could be a problem also, cause if 2 people send funds to the same borrower with an expectation of an ROI then someone is going to be upset if they do not get the ROI they thought they were, this will impact the community and cause damage to the project.


[06/05/2022 1:21 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
Clear agreements should also be considered (you are going to like the framework developed by our friends in Kenya üôÇ) @Jayinergo what happens if I default? What if I end up in the ER and am unable to make my repayment cause of medical conditions and I cannot even relay that to you or to anyone?
This is something to really think about, for a borrower with intent to repay like myself I should probably have a back up plan, I mean 1000 Erg is no chump change and if I default cause of conditions outside of my control (noone tries to go to the ER) hopefully there would be a way to figure out how to ensure I do not get totally Rekt - I took a loan from someone I trust and this relationship between Borrower and Lender could be further developed, we have been in private messages for a long time and now doing things in the open together, and I think Jerry could verify any details of an explanation of why (if it happened) I defaulted based on an ER visit and asked him for forgiveness, I would hope we build a platform here where forgiveness can be introduced
and adopted although I do not know exactly what that looks like - we are working globally and life happens - Know Your Assumptions as a Borrower or Lender - this is very important - KNOW YOUR ASSUMPTIONS.

(re @GroupAnonymousBot : *Will there be penalties for late repayment? What problems do you forsee*) 
 
 I think there is a lot of development in front of us, introducing late payment penalties is going to be a difficult task and makes me wonder if having the option to pay late is good or not, and to combine that with credit scores will be interesting.


[06/05/2022 11:32 PM] GroupAnonymousBot#0000
Late penalties may be something to be voted on by EXLE holders I suppose, but not until after completion of MVP build


[06/05/2022 11:35 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
Ya you are right, that is far enough out that there will be time to think about it and build a ExIP for to be voted on, The MVP was SLE and its done, the SLT build is where the devs are right now.

 Understood, thanks for clarity. How would repayment be handled in this example. Say 3 wallets fund one loan. Does borrower pay each wallet 1/3 of a full months payment each month. Or does each wallet get one full months payment every 3 months? Is it asking too much of the borrower to make payments to different wallets. Just brainstorming here.

[06/08/2022 3:31 PM] GroupAnonymousBot#0000
(re @Giufa : *How do you intend to create value around the token?

 I can only share with you my opinion, which is token holders will be the ones to create utility & value for the tokens, through engagement in the DAO. Token holders will decide through votes, whether protocol fees will be distributed to token holders. This is the most obvious source of token value imo.


[06/08/2022 3:34 PM] GroupAnonymousBot#0000
(re @Giufa : *How do you intend to create value around the token?

 Or token holders will propose & vote on whether or not the dao treasury itself should participate in lending to generate revenue. And whether or not that revenue generation should be distributed to token holders. These are questions token holders themselves will answer through their governance power. This is not the role of the dev team imo.

[06/08/2022 6:21 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
(re @white : *is it possible this month?*) 
 
 Well its actually going to be V2, there was temporary access too v1 which was the Erg contracts, and V2 will be the SigUSD contracts, there are 3 developers working on a release for the SLT targeted for this month, one of the priorities the developers will be working on is ensuring that our system is scalable not only for the devs building it who are familiar with it, but also for others as we see the possibility of other developers plugging into the project as we expand and grow.

(re @white : *I didn't know ErgoLend could this be dynamic (allowing different types of  repayment structure - monthly/weekly).

What I'll be doing is a little bit ironic for ErgoLend tho‚Äîbeing a p2p lending platform. What we do here, is we also lend money to villagers (typically fishermen, farmers, and small store owners, etc). S...*) 
 
 Did you want to add your loan request to the Tracker that was put together and get started P2P?


[06/08/2022 6:26 PM] Haskell_plus#0000

Sorry for my bad English


[06/08/2022 6:58 PM] quirk220#0000
Do you know if the credit system that will be eventually applied using Ergolend, could be something that could potentially be used by other lending providers as well on other block chains?  I ask this, because it may be a great way to expand Ergolend's reach beyond its direct community in the future.  

Ergolend is first and foremost a lending provider of course, but I wonder if the platform could also serve as a key base layer for a universal credit rating system down the line.


[06/08/2022 7:02 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
(re @Giufa : *How do you intend to create value around the token?
How will you guarantee that borrowers will pay their debt?*) 
 
 As said its probably not the dev teams job to give value to the token outside of the development of the platform, however let me lay out a basic description of a proposal I would ask for the dao to vote on with some solid reasoning.

Mock Proposal:

We have continually  worked toward developing trusted borrowers and sponsors - these people are recognized in our lending community and have demonstrated their ability to take loans and repay loans and after some thoughtful discussions and considerations *link* together we have determined that there is high value in supporting the Exle Dao token holders by providing a priority first access to token holders,we we will be calling this program the: Exle Premiere Partners (EPP), the borrowers that this proposal would first include will be named here *link* and a history of their repayments here *link*, the ROI Lenders have experienced has been significant and the impact of the funds has been even greater as can be seen by borrower stories here *link*, we recognize that not all loans have been funded by token holders and by creating the EPP this will temporarily limit some of the platforms lenders to fund a loan immediately - however, this project will seek to further develop the relationships between lenders and borrowers and ensure that the Exle token holders can benefit from their participation in the DAO.
Before work goes into the EPP to develop it and decide the thresholds that allow exclusive participation to token holders a vote on this matter of providing the EPP should be taken according to the voting procedures concerning proposals.
Etc etc.


[06/08/2022 7:05 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
(re @Giufa : *How do you intend to create value around the token?
How will you guarantee that borrowers will pay their debt?*) 
 
 I will be sponsoring personally the two P2P loans that have been up for review - this I will do to bootstrap the program.

 Just for clarity real quick - Exle/ErgoLend is not a lending provider, we are developing pathways for peer to peer interactions.

I can assure you we have the right developers on our team seeking to provide open source tool sets that are built to be scalable and anyone that chooses to use them should be able to in the future, do not expect the credit rating feature soon - although it is on our dash board it is not our first priority.

Thank you Chris!  I was just thinking a few years down the road.  It would be great if the credit system (when its created) could be applied to additional services outside of the Ergolend network and potentially used for services on Cardano as well.

I don't see why not, if we can successfully build a credit system that allows for anonymous use there could be a lot of potential for it.

 I had a chance to review and am glad to see you listed SigUSD and are happy to wait for v2, I definitely want to help you list a successful proposal and I have a few questions.

1. How often do you make the micro loans?
2. How long does it take for your community to repay these loans?
3. What exactly are these loans usually used for (just curious)?
4. Is it possible that with a revolving credit line you could make a larger impact in your community?
5. Would you be willing to restructure your repayment schedule?
6. Do you wish to remain Anonymous or comfortable with a Self Doxx to an investor?
7. Can you help everyone understand how long you have been in our community?

I could go on with more, but I will wait for answers from these first ones, and please do not feel obligated to answer any in any specific manner.

There are 2 new loan proposal's to be reviewed in review channel - so I will not be closing that just yet as I had said that I would be, these new loans come with a full Doxx of prospective borrowers.

 That‚Äôs a good statement. A lot of us take part in a DAO and asks, how can THEY make the value go up. But a lot of people forget that buying the token gives you a form of ownership, (like buying shares) and maybe the question can be shifted from: 

how can they increase the token value?

Is staking coming soon?  This may be a way to stabilize price and reward long term supporters.


[06/15/2022 7:34 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
That topic has seen very little conversation which kind of shows little interest in it, would be curious to hear anyones take on staking and how it can be applied to benefit the dao supporters though.


[06/15/2022 7:40 PM] JCFishing#0000
During the bear market, supporters can accumulate more exle tokens through staking.  Supporters should be rewarded especially during bear market or more people may consider selling their exle holdings.


[06/15/2022 8:15 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
It is something worth thinking about, I myself am not a big fan of staking rewards being the same token in a dao organization that does not have parameters of voting set, we won't see that until Paideia is available, I also am not a big fan of touching the treasury for anything more than development purposes to strengthen the organization and expand, yet all things should probably be considered and pro's and con's should be weighed and decisions should be made that reflect the values of the project.


[06/15/2022 9:25 PM] Ma11#0000
I like the hold-rewarding incentive aspect of staking, but agreed without it accounted for in the tokenomics, would make sense to put it to a DAO proposal/vote.

 Come to think of it, maybe should have use the strategic round tokens for staking rewards, 5-8 years emission instead of burning.  Anyway, just a thought for staking.


[06/15/2022 10:15 PM] JCFishing#0000
Right now looking at the erg/ergolend spreads daily, it's better to hold Erg than Ergolend.  There are selling pressure everyday and people can buy ergolend back at a later time for cheaper price without losing any opportunity.  staking is a way for people to staying in the game and gain more exle.  without it, there will be more selling until it goes close to staker round price or lower.


[06/15/2022 10:17 PM] JCFishing#0000
I said lower because of bear market, people may want to get out completely.....staking in this instance reward supporters.


[06/15/2022 10:55 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
I can understand your position but there is no proof that staking rewards won't be dumped as soon as they get earned and further impacting the cost of Exle, yet there is proof that whales just increase their supply which increases their voting position, when you think of the tokonomics of Exle you have to consider the future of the organization and what role voting rights will have in guiding the organization, I don't think it is wise that just for having Exle your voting power increases and continues to compound.


[06/15/2022 10:56 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
each to their own though


[06/15/2022 11:03 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
I also want to point out that the market was not great when the contribution rounds started and the IDO launched, yet people still invested, if we all try to staunch the bear market bleeding by messing around with the tokonomics that are not proven to help anything we could just be causing more harm than good to the organization.


[06/15/2022 11:06 PM] GroupAnonymousBot#0000
tokenomics once launched should not be touched


[06/15/2022 11:06 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
My position is always going to be that a proper proposal and voting procedure be used before any such kind of tokonomics are introduced that affects the organizations treasury

The tokenomics are built with the future value of the token in mind as well.  I would look at other successful lending tokens as a model for what is possible.  If anything people should be buying Ergo Lend instead of Ergo for a longterm hold (if the goal is to generate wealth).


[06/16/2022 3:34 AM] quirk220#0000
Meant that not to be a reply.  People need to buy ergo too of course, but for those who are already bag holders, they will see the natural value in this token when the time comes.

Question to our potential users/lenders.

Should repayment funds only be extractable after the repayment height is reached. Or should it be extractable as long as there's funds in it (implementation may require fees for txs and maintaining the boxes).


[06/19/2022 2:57 AM] keitodot#0000
Our current idea is to only retrievable at the end of the repayment deadline or if its fully repaid. That's for beta version

(re @keitodot : *Our current idea is to only retrievable at the end of the repayment deadline or if its fully repaid. That's for beta version*) 
 
 isn't it planned to have monthly payments?

(re @keitodot : *Question to our potential users/lenders.

Should repayment funds only be extractable after the repayment height is reached. Or should it be extractable as long as there's funds in it (implementation may require fees for txs and maintaining the boxes).*) 
 
 Sounds like a nice feature, but not integral.


[06/19/2022 4:34 AM] keitodot#0000
(re @GroupAnonymousBot : *isn't it planned to have monthly payments?*) 
 
 So there's 2 options. One is that whenever the repayment gets funded, Lenders can decide to get the payment. However, this will cost some transaction fee. As boxes has to be created, and it has to go through transactions which requires mining fee. So lenders would have to pay that.

If that is preferred. We can make it so that there's the option.

The current and naive implementation is that repayment is only retrievable if the repayment is fully repaid (repayment box fully funded). Reason being for this implementation is because its simpler as we move forward with a SLT mvp. However, we do intend to have versioning. 

So the question is more, would our community prefer us investing a little more time into getting the monthly fund back to lender system working right off the bat.

 Can we have the two options, and each lender chooses what‚Äôs right for him? If there are benefits for the ecosystem for the funds to be left in - until the loan is fully refunded, let those who leave early pay the tx fees.
In general I would say - when there is money back from a loan, it makes sense to distribute - since it could be made available to another loan. If it just sits there - it does good to no one (unless, as I wrote above, there‚Äôs some other benefit to the ecosystem)

[06/23/2022 8:47 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
This market is tuff ü•∂, half of my friends are mostly quiet right now about changing the world, but for me this is a time to really dial in and work without hype affecting my team or those that are invested around us, so... I think it is a good time to pose a problem to y'all that I am dealing with.

I am seeking  advice from $EXLE holders on how to properly reward people that have committed to this project and have worked towards our goals to push for microfinance to be a reality on the ergo blockchain, I can not do this alone and these people I support that have assisted Exle to help people realize what we are attempting to do to disrupt the corruption of lending practices  and provide fair contracts that reward both lenders and borrowers have been involved weekly since last year, I personally trust these people that I am proposing for retroactive rewards for their work to form a community of borrowers for Exle that can provide high assurance of repayment through our hybrid design of utilizing smart contracts for uncollateralized loans.
I propose that token holders approve an allotment of the $EXLE designated for DAO Reserve to be awarded to the team that has been pioneering this movement, this team is lead by @Denicio_Bernier   myself and 3 other individuals that have put in the work to help Exle truly make change in Kenya, John Eyanae, Grace Lotoom, @officedge,  and led in Nigeria by @jaycidiq 

To be honest, without Paideia it is difficult for Exle to move forward and reward those that deserve it for bringing Exle to where it is now, yet I believe that we can utilize a social trust and not apply pressure on development of Paideia, we can reward the contributors for working on this project through discussing why they deserve it.

Should be noted that @Denicio_Bernier has assumed lead position for a significant amount of time and is relaying Exle developments to our team in Kenya, while seeking to develop 2 other borrower communities.

 Didn‚Äôt the team have 21% of exle allocation?  

The price of exle is under selling pressure every day and without staking, people will continue to sell as I predicted.  I‚Äôm not talking about high staking rewards, maybe 7-10% for the next 3-5 years.  I understand you are against this idea and depending of what the exle protocol
will be headed, it will dictate decision for alot of supporters. 

For people like denicio and others who is important to the infrastructure, shouldn‚Äôt they charge a percentage for their work of the loan like a bank?  This will not affect exle holders/supporters.  If the loan is 8%, they can charge 9 or 10% and pocket the difference.  

Just my 2 cents.

 I love it how you come back to staking  again, I hold my position that in a project that uses gov tokens to guide it should not reward people that hold those gov tokens by increasing their voting power through giving them more of the tokens - it makes no good sense to me, still open to listening to a reasonable argument that has more substance than I have seen so far.

 Have you follow the spread on a daily basis?  Not 1 day the spread was higher than the previous day.  It means more selling everyday.  If there are more supporters, the price (spread erg/exle) will either stabilize or go up.  Unfortunately this is not the case on a daily basis.

 The 21% for the core team was for 3 people only as the project was soley ours until plans to create the dao were initiated through the token distribution, the treasury was created to support the project to see it expand, devs are already willing to receive it for payment to work on EXLE, so you are saying that Denecio should charge the communities he is building up and add a cost to the loans that we are trying to drive cost's down for? And the EXLE tokens in treasury should be used for staking to reduce sell pressure so lets not reward people with EXLE tokens for driving awareness and education of ergoLend forward so that it can be used in the communities it is designed for. smh man

I am at a loss man, but I welcome all your feedback as it fires me up.

You mentioned in Kenya that loan apy was up to 700% per year.   You mean exle cannot make it work to make a good loan for these communities and at the same time provide infrastructure partners small percentage of the loan reward?  Again, 700% apy as you mentioned.  

We both should just take a time out.

 Ask the people in Kenya what works best for them, they have provided 4 loan proposal's, ask them how they came up with the numbers and how it compares to what they have available right now, I never asked that question, but I know that over 7 months of meeting with them they understand what the project is for and are willing to help others understand their position.

 From the interviews they did, even if people want to borrow with high apy, they cannot be qualified for a loan.  I‚Äôm not here to argue with you.

 You know, waiting on Paidia is not fun, just so you know though: as soon as it is available then its likely that a staking proposal will likely be brought forward and it will need discussion, I like to think using the Cardano Catalyst rewards for participation as a model combined with staking requirements   could be a good way to reward contributors that hold EXLE, the organization is expected to create profits and those profits should probably be distributed to the gov token holders when it does, yet probably should only go to those willing to stake.

 This makes sense to me. Staking to earn a share of treasury revenue is logical. Staking in this scenario should also have a significant lockup period imo. 3-12months for example.

 Maybe we can go retro active too, like the tokens that don't move from a wallet from xx/xx date and then get staked from that wallet would already have time accrued when the staking contract is initiated, I kind of dislike how staking announcements create buy pressure

What‚Äôs the difference whether the origination fee to pay Denicio comes from EXLE or is added to an applicant‚Äôs loan interest rate?

Is it that it gives the appearance that he‚Äôs a loan shark rather than a community loan facilitator?

 service fee's


[06/23/2022 11:31 PM] ChrisHobotnica#0000
Could you run us through an example of a loan that includes: amount, duration, interest rate, the Originator‚Äôs fee (Denicio), net amount received by the Lender and the Service Fees paid to the EXLE DAO?

(re @ChrisHobotnica : *Could you run us through an example of a loan that includes: amount, duration, interest rate, the Originator‚Äôs fee (Denicio), net amount received by the Lender and the Service Fees paid to the EXLE DAO?*) 
 
 Not sure who you were asking, I do not think Denicio has an interest in originator fee's, for what he does it is much more than just finding someone to take a loan out, a community is very important to the level of success Exle can have, and it has always been a goal to build communities on both sides of loan agreements .


[06/24/2022 9:14 AM] ChrisHobotnica#0000
Ah, that makes more sense. So Denicio is a community facilitator and therefore more closely resembles an EXLE employee/contractor, hence a wage paid from treasury would be more appropriate

[07/04/2022 7:52 AM] Flying Pig#0000
Egio/exle/thz are all experiencing daily dump. People are taking profits and risk off in this market. 

That will be the case until bull market OR the projects delivering something tangible.

Prices will go down until they hit IDO price.... Not a lot can be done about that. Except maybe offer staking...that will keep some pressure off initially whilst the project is being built. But even then people will sell....

If the project is solid and delivers price will recover.

That will be the case until bull market OR the projects delivering something tangible.

Prices will go down until they hit IDO price.... Not a lot can be done about that. Except maybe offer staking...that will keep some pressure off initially whilst the project is being built. But even then people will sell....

During a bull market it's much easier to market a new product to attract new investors and keep the price up. Unfortunately EGIO and EXLE launched during the transition from bull to bear and many of the early investors want to recoup as much as possible to limit potential losses. Investing early I'm new projects has a huge risk (no matter the quality of said product). And in a bear market even more so!!

This is the excact reason Darkpool delayed their IDO and go back to their day jobs for now. They would not have been able to raise the full amount and the early stakers would have drained liquidity leaving seed and public token holders with the bag. Of course if the project succeeds them the joke is on the early sellers.

We all need to put food on the table and personally I'm selling a portion of all daily released tokens, but I will keep the majority for the longer term gain.

Incidentally this looks to be happening with Ergopad right now...the price was going down down down but in the last few days a large investor has swooped up 2 million tokens....bolstering the price. Either they are firm believers in the project OR they are looking for a quick buck and will sell in 8 weeks when the penalty is 0

 We are on the same page conserning the release and market conditions, what I'm really curious about though is: 
Are the same investors buying in ErgoPad pre-sales just to take advantage of the liquidity provided at IDO? And how does it map out by EP holdings?


[07/04/2022 3:08 PM] Flying Pig#0000
Good question. I did some sleuthing a few weeks ago and noticed that the biggest Ergopad holder (couple of millions) sold all their EGIO holdings every day. I didn't look at EXLE at the time since my main concern was a bunch of EGIO I bought from the DEX which had halved in value. When staking was introduced the price went up 20%. When staking was broken the price went down again.

Net net, until all the vested tokens are released price will go down for most project (my theory...). And at that point the quality of the project will determine the price going forward.

The only exception so far seems to be paideia since they have a very clear vision, near complete project and a plan for how token holders will benefit.

I am really interested in this Œ£ID idea, I am now exploring how the government mechanics using EN is going to work and how it can be applied in step with the mission of Exle, some of you $EXLE holders might be interested in exploring this also and maybe the DAO can utilize the EN in some way moving forward.
Setting up the token weighted voting for Exle could be difficult when voting tooling is available (Paidiea), and it could be useful to use Œ£ID's to install initial parameters, the one person-one vote idea EN is developing utilizing gamification to prevent bots or fraud could be the best route to ensure we get token voting off to a good start.

 Not yet, there has been a lot of talk about how the market affects investors willingness to make an investment - also with most of in here having experienced a loss in the crypto market past few months - year I think we all want to recover a bit before making such lengthy loans, would also seem that there are some people waiting to specifically use the SLT contracts that the devs are working on.

I will be putting a plan together over the coming days to fund a loan to our field partners in Kenya, as the development team continues to work toward a flawless P2P experience I will begin the process of P2P micro lending by example, thank you all for continuing to support the project.
With this step we can learn together how to improve our process, what we need to avoid, and how we can succeed and expand.
I know that this project was not funded by accident and that the ergonauts involved in funding it understand what we want to achieve IS possible - we can do this if we can stay focused on the mission and if we continue forward no matter the exterior obstacles that would slow us down, anyone who want's to join me in funding the first loan connected to Exle please reach out, even if just 1 $SigUSD come be a part of this, be assured I will cover the rest to kickstart something I have been waiting to do for a long time.

 Asking again - just to make sure; every address that provides Ergs to the raffle, provided it is successful - will receive back the provided amount plus 5%?


[07/07/2022 1:36 PM] ChrisHobotnica#0000
With inflation at 7%-10% in the US, a SigUSD loan at 5% is equivalent to an inflation adjusted return of -2% to investors. Futhermore the risk of default needs to be calculated and imputed. 
Initial loan rates used as a proof-of-concept can be priced cheaply, but for an attractive & sustainable long-term lender-borrower market, I estimate the current APY ought to be higher

Current US Inflation Rate 7%
+ a default premium (5%*7%) = 0.35%
Total Loan Rate 7.35%

 I agree we are going to have people go through a learning curve here, and when/if loans are made regularly borrowers will have to be more financially educated to better understand how some lenders will want to see an ROI that does outpace inflation.

Forwarded from Ergo Nation Announcements: Chris Ray from Ergolend is planning a use-case for Œ£ID holders. If you don't have one yet, then now is the time to start learning how ErgoNation works. 

The next verification event is on 11th of July at 13.00 UTC. You will need 1 ERG mixed in a fresh wallet to participate. Mixing can take a few days, so the best time to start is right now. 

ErgoNation and ErgoLend ideals are well aligned. Both are aspiring to community driven decentralized development. 

ErgoNation can provide ideological viewpoint from active ecosystem members. It completes user and investor interest that already have representation in ErgoLend.

PSA

This is a WARNING that all $EXLE token holders should heed and pay attention to:
in the last 24 hours an issue has arisen within the eutxo transfer of tokens and the limits of how many tokens can be transferred by the ergo wallets and the protocol, although unclear to myself on the exact limits of how many values can be safely transacted I implore all holders to look into the subject, it is a developing issue that has yet to be resolved or clarified on exactly how it impacts token holder‚Äôs, personally I have identified a vulnerability for token holders that I believe could expose them to an attack on their holdings based on my understanding of the issue, if my assumptions are correct or not I advise all Exle holders to proceed with caution in making transactions from wallets they hold $EXLE in and seek to understand the issue.
I will provide thoughts on my opinion of the vulnerability soon, you can find discussion on the problem in the development channel in the Ergo discord, and also in the Nautilus telegram channel.


[07/09/2022 7:01 AM] yeahokai#0000
So do not make any transactions right now?


[07/09/2022 7:08 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
(re @yea.ok : *So do not make any transactions right now?*) 
 
 I advise all to understand the issue before making a transaction from a wallet they hold EXLE in, it seems the problem is with having many tokens involved in the transaction building process and tokens could be burnt for reasons unknown to me.


[07/09/2022 7:15 AM] shadowanswer#0000
Do EXLE vesting key count?


[07/09/2022 7:20 AM] Haskell_plus#0000

 The key is represented by a token, so yes it counts, please be familiar with the current situation and make sure your investments are safe.

(re @odiseus_me : *And you know it is only EXLE tokens that are affected?*) 
 
 This was confusing me too. I think it's an ergo blockchain issue affecting all tokens? It would be helpful to get some clarification


[07/09/2022 7:52 AM] Joseph#0000
I went to Ergo Development page in discord i havent seen anything relating to EXLE specifically unless im completely missing the right place


[07/09/2022 8:02 AM] Flying Pig#0000
Someone sent 269 NFTs (tokens) in one transaction whereas the max is 255 or 4kb per box. All the tokens were burnt......

Absolutely an issue and the Devs are all over it.


[07/09/2022 8:03 AM] Flying Pig#0000
This is not related to EXLE or any specific token. I'm sure they will figure out a way to fix this, but it's not a good problem to have.


[07/09/2022 8:05 AM] shadowanswer#0000

 It's important to the core team to involve token holders in decisions that are made as we move forward, I asked for token holders to weigh in on compensating Tortodelivery for his contributions to what now represents the project - i heard cricket's, I didn't get a response except from him, and I really would like everyone to know that the team is very grateful that you all joined us in this effort and we want you to be included in as many decisions as is fitting, even the smol ones if possible, just pitch in with your point of view, let's get governance started now while its small decisions so we can be ready for big issues later.

Not just from my own selfish standpoint as an investor, I think if we continue to trend into the red given the current market, all EXLE holders will not be very happy with any further price dilution to fund a project which may or may not actually build for EXLE (and ultimately lead to increased market cap which altruism aside, is most peoples main goal here). The investor sentiment can turn very sour very quickly and that can become a huge issue for any ecosystem.

 I am in the process of proving their value through seeking to bring true value to the organization by delivering on what we promised, I cannot market the token in and of itself, I am sorry my position does not allow me to do that, I can market the movement and what we are proving, anyone who holds Exle tokens has supported or indirectly is supporting the Nuevo solution to Microfinance funding on the platform


[07/13/2022 8:16 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
In a very short period of time from now after funding the first loans we will see many proposals come forward looking to avoid the cost's associated with borrowing from legacy financial institutions, the P2P support we are providing will allow access to competing loan proposals that can provide lenders not just a 1 time installment of an ROI on their funds but a lifetime of investor/borrower relationship if they so choose to engage and learn how to make Exle work for them, this will bring long term value to the organization, and as the organization is guided by the token it will bring value to it to

Therefore, we've decided that the best move forward is to burn the tokens which increases each individual‚Äôs stake in the total supply. Your percentage will increase, while our total percentages will remain the same, to ensure that these changes are fair

@officedge is our blockchain trainer and has travelled to the rural areas more than once to train and get everyone setup for exchanges, Mpesa, wallets, etc.

Based on his knowledge of how the groups organize themselves, and what he has witnessed in the rural areas, he is convinced that once we‚Äôre up and running the team could onboard 20k borrowers in the first year

As the borrowers continue to show their ability to repay loans and the platform continues to grow in popularity, I expect to see more and more lenders participate as well üòä

 Hi, indeed it's crucial to have access to on-off fiat-crypto ramps. You would require businesses joining a P2P network or create an exchange.

 Not sure if you're trolling. 

I understand your effort on trying to push exle for everyone, and you're trying to do your part. But when it comes to creating nfts, especially regarding using other people's photo and faces, please be respectful of their request when they say they don't want their face to be on an nft.

 After some thought about it Rero it might be best if you can capture more in an NFT that is meant to represent the initiative rather than trying to use my likeness alone, I might be the most active vocally surrounding Exle but there are many many people involved in driving it to where it currently is, for 1 using my likeness alone excludes the community members that have funded the treasury of Exle and  the funds being used for compensation of development, I think these people who joined the IDO should be recognized as investing in a novel blockchain project that is pioneering the exploration of P2P solutions and connecting our ecosystem through relationships rather than just through code - this would seem to include you Rero - on top of the investor's who have chosen to be a part of the DAO I think an emphasis should be on the developers in our ecosystem, they should be recognized, not just those working on Exle, all of those that have worked on ergo to date - the greatest assets in our ecosystem are the developers that are willing to share information with each other to create the tools that the rest of us can use, and I can tell you first hand that Exle developers have used the material of other developers that put work in before them.

[07/20/2022 5:46 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
In my experience charity support is often limited in how it can empower someone, the restrictions are set by the stewards of the funds, so although charity programs are great support in communities - microfinance with Exle allows for the community to decide how they can make an impact.

 No no no no, its more a matter of exploring how someone can utilize the program to reach community goals, understanding how to build trust with lenders and provide value to lenders in a win/win situation.

Sir why don't u prepare pre planned interest rates based on the amt of the loan n the tenure


[07/20/2022 6:27 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
We do not make the loans, simple as that


[07/20/2022 6:28 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
it is the people on the platform that make the loans


[07/20/2022 6:28 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
borrowers should design a loan that is attractive to lenders


[07/20/2022 6:28 PM] REROLABS#0000
That's the problem sir


[07/20/2022 6:29 PM] REROLABS#0000

 Ya for sure, I have a lot of work to do on education, to be honest I also am learning the best route to take, but also without the site being fully functional the education is not completely needed yet and one on one education as we bootstrap is going to provide value as the conversation grows and expands.

I think that in underdeveloped countries, the poorest people will not benefit from Ergolend. These people don't even have the money to survive with dignity. They depend on the government/charity for  living. Perhaps it will help more middle-class or micro-entrepreneurs who are starting a new business.

 Living in a poor country does not stop people from borrowing, it does however subject them to predatory lending imo, which in turn keeps them poor as all of their would be profits are funneled into wealthy pockets

 Hi @Haskell_plus 
Had a chat with my in laws today.
It appear that their network is in Pakistan - not India.

But my father in law reminded me of a family friend who is from India  and who‚Äôs father is owner of a midsize congregation. 

Not sure if he‚Äôs on holiday but I‚Äôll try to get hold of him this week and let you know asap.

As of next week I‚Äôll be on leave, so if I‚Äôm not successful then that‚Äôll be after my holiday üëäüèΩ

Excited to see how the SC will work and hoewel lenders and borrowers will interact - especially when it comes to repayments.

 Hi Chris! What is the current total (max) supply of EXLE?


[07/27/2022 11:57 PM] Gianniscardano#0000
I mean after the burn! Is this true that 23 million EXLE have just been burnt? !!!


[07/27/2022 11:58 PM] Gianniscardano#0000
Do I remember correctly? Was the initial total supply at 75 million EXLE? So now total supply of EXLE ever in existence is and will be 52 million? !


[07/27/2022 11:59 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
I am trying to find the right tool that shows exactly how many are in circulation, I lost it somewhere not knowing I would use it


[07/28/2022 12:00 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
it is recorded on the blockchain I just can't remember how to access it


[07/28/2022 12:00 AM] Gianniscardano#0000
It's ok don't worry about that!


[07/28/2022 12:01 AM] Gianniscardano#0000
So now we are talking about 52 million EXLE in existence totally?


[07/28/2022 12:01 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
the transaction above shows the outputs of the $EXLE sent to oblivion, there is no input for them

Trust yet verify ;)


[07/28/2022 12:03 AM] Gianniscardano#0000
Is it roughly 52 million now I am not talking about circulation but total EXLE supply?


[07/28/2022 12:03 AM] Gianniscardano#0000
75 - 23 = 52 right?


[07/28/2022 12:05 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
The policy on the ergo explorer will show 75 million, the proof of burn transaction reduces the amount to 52,072,948


[07/28/2022 12:05 AM] Gianniscardano#0000
Maximum supply 52 million EXLE! This would be party news for me and my brother!

How is development going ? We sold some vested tokens but now we stopped we still have rather large quantities of EXLE and we are waiting patiently for development!

(re @Gianniscardano : *You know how investors feel they all like a good burn of tokens!*) 
 
 A good provable burn increases your stake, and trust me when I say we have a storm coming, and your stake is going to make sense when we prove that the unbanked are willing to use the Exle platform and make repayments.


[07/28/2022 12:12 AM] Gianniscardano#0000

 Development is focused on ensuring we can scale, we want to ensure there are no bottle necks for requests or repayments, and so are building to allow for thousands of users at once and ensuring that we can record the info for later use.


[07/28/2022 12:14 AM] Gianniscardano#0000

 I do not want to pressure the Dev team to deliver sooner by cutting corners, but @kiidot our lead developer does think 1 month or 1-1/2 month is feasible to release, at that time I will create a video of how to properly use the platform, and we are seeking to invest from our raised funds to produce a very nice website that plugs into the users social channels, just like Gofundme or other fund raising sites do.


[07/28/2022 12:21 AM] Gianniscardano#0000
Great news! This is faster than I thought!


[07/28/2022 12:21 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
I am also seeking collaborations to build with over the coming months


[07/28/2022 12:22 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
When seeking to fund the unbanked there are many projects that could benefit from the Exle platform.


[07/28/2022 12:22 AM] Gianniscardano#0000
Can you approach any big name in Cardano? Do a pitch and ask for cross-chain collab even through powerful project Catalyst?


[07/28/2022 12:23 AM] Gianniscardano#0000
Is this practically feasible?


[07/28/2022 12:23 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
I love my friends on Cardano, and they will come when the platform is ready to use, I have no doubt...


[07/28/2022 12:23 AM] Gianniscardano#0000
Yes indeed! They will come in large numbers!


[07/28/2022 12:25 AM] Gianniscardano#0000

 The backend should be ready in 1-1.5 months. Fingers crossed. We haven‚Äôt fully coordinated with the front end due to the amount of work and design from the backend and the limited time we have while working our full time job and going through the waves of life. But we‚Äôre doing our best to release a product that users can be confident in first and foremost.


Tests will be written to ensure security of the contracts and future proof it in terms of security when the wave comes and hacker comes in. Trust that we are vigilant ;)


[07/28/2022 12:26 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
Collabs at this point in time would slow our efforts as they can become distractions while we still need to build out our platform, we need to stay focused on our mission, and when it is appropriate to expand - I will be 100% seeking to expand and approach other projects that are in line with our mission.


[07/28/2022 12:27 AM] Gianniscardano#0000

 We have friends that want the same model on Cardano, it might be better if they just use a user friendly bridge and use our platform, lots of idea's and thought goes into how to cross-chain.


[07/28/2022 12:30 AM] Gianniscardano#0000
Yes this will be huge if it is achieved after the building of the platform! Thousands of cardano users, fans, investors whatever will jump on the train!

 I was just thinking about Kushti's comments he made about loans and L2s also, how to make them user friendly, I believe the Rosen bridge will open up alot of unknown development for Exle, and Spectrum is likely going to be the L2 that leads innovation.

I probably sound like Old Cato, but besides the issue of collateral, we/ErgoLend have to deal with how we ensure that our lenders, and borrowers are legit; we don‚Äôt want any Feds or their likes snooping around here or worse‚Ä¶ and I am sure we don‚Äôt want to (at least most of us) build a system that would lend money that would fund criminal/illegal activities

 With this regard, the local community which we are building (that I'm involved) we are looking into ways that will integrate the legacy systems that deter risk lending and also build a KYC to vet those that we shall onboard as successful borrowers to guide the project projectory for  success and also to avoid any unlawful/illegal activities that would be tied with borrowing from ergolend.

 This is great! And it is a must, and is doable in small communities - but I think that if we want (and i think long-term, we would) ErgoLend to be a more global lending platform - we would need to have in place technology/processes for KYC that are independent of personal acquaintances.

What about if you convert it into USD and then Rupees via (Transfer)Wise etc?


[07/29/2022 9:30 PM] ChrisHobotnica#0000
So when a borrower bottows Ergo or SigUSD from the EXLE lending markets, they will be taxed when the funds are converted to Indian Rupees in order to pay for labour or purchase capital items.

In order to not convert to Rupees the following might be required 
- SigUSD or Dexy Gold stable to be accepted as a unit of account (long-term capacity building) OR
- Off-ramp infrastructure exists where an Indian can convert crypto to USD or EUR & then into Indian Rupees > like a (Transfer)Wise multi-currency account (short-term integration with existing services)

Would hopping from another FX currency prevent the crypto > INR tax?

 How would people convert EXLE to INR? won‚Äôt they need to go through a CEX ?

If there is a possibility of converting to INR using a non-Indian CEX then I believe this should be part of an educational program ( @Haskell_plus ) 

But someone will nee to follow developments in case laws change. 

We can‚Äôt have borrowers paying 40% taxes of their loans, and expect them to still honor repayment of the nominal + interest. That‚Äôs quite a burden on the borrower.

Haven‚Äôt tried it, but if you can withdraw USD from Kucoin to a multi-currency bank account - Wise > convert USD to INR in Wise & then withdraw INR to linked domestic Indian Bank account‚Ä¶.
It may work

Sounds like something worth trying/testing. 

Unfortunately I‚Äôm not in India, so my suggestion would be to find someone who is as l ready familiar with the process of exchanging crypto to fiat (and back) 

That person can test several options, including kucoin, and report back to us their findings.

Would then also be interested in the amount of fees required for the whole process.

 Yes I have been learning about EXLE and Ergo in general. I got many good ressources (though the Discord channel relies heavily on bots which are not very friendly üòÖ). Ekival would basically allow EXLE to send the same loan but the beneficiary would have yet another venue to receive cash or mobile money. The front end could be shared and wallet integration would guide whether the user uses Cardano or Ergo. I'm working on the smart contract flow logic so I can get a Dev within Ergo to guide me on the best way to integrate. But already I have a good understanding of the ergo scripts.

 I understand but i think of some people and entities that neither use telegram, discord or twitter. It might be a barrier, i will mention your philosophy and see what i can pitch. I think the concept is groundbreaking and the things i saw from your attempts with locals in Kenia really have this special kind of spice you rarely find in business.

 We are getting closer to our V1 stablecoin smart contract release, and everything before that will be the early days, then we are off to the races üòâ

 Ok, for the beginning i have an idea about 2 guys working on various countries in Africa (Nigeria & DRK aswell as some minors on the coastline) that might be interested. They currently work with GDF and some other entities to battle Malaria and various natural economical challenges in the region. I will reach out the upcoming days after i extracted a small summary out of the information you gave me. Lets see what happens.


[08/05/2022 12:33 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
Good luck!
I hope to see you here more in the future also, and if you like and if your interested we can schedule some voice calls where I can help bring some clarity to ergolends intentions.


[08/05/2022 12:33 AM] Senna#0000

I would like to share a few updates from Kenya with everyone.

Patrick has spent about 2 weeks training in rural Kenya on the use of Blockchain wallets, the loans made to Grace and Margaret have created a lot of excitement and discussion and has encouraged people to be more involved in what we are seeking to accomplish.
There are now over 70 people involved and they are all bringing idea's to the table with the intention of creating a cooperative that can use best practices learned over time to ensure ErgoLend is a success in their community - they are encouraging people within their community to design successful loan proposal's that would assist them in building generational wealth, some of these people are business owners that would like the opportunity to expand their businesses and some of these people would propose new business plans - all of the proposals are being reviewed by the team before they will be passed on to Exle Lenders.
Over the next week we hope to have status updates from the 2 businesses we have made loans to.
We are reminded of the issues affecting these communities that are barriers for them to access finance, our friends in Kenya continue to be grateful and refer to what we are attempting to do and offer the world as "A Dream".

 Fully diluted would be around 1.4 million, however, I don't know what circulating supply is right now so I could not give you a solid answer on what it is.

An update to our communities on the Backend Development.

We've gotten bots and transactions working in development. And APIs are being built. 

Our main holdup now is a stage in the contract. We're not able to get it to pass in the net and we're finding ways to debug it. (Debugging tx on the net are tricky)

The stage (turning loans to repayments) is mid way of the whole multi-level tx. Therefore it requires the first few steps of tx to get to that step too everytime we test it.

That being said, we're working on figuring that part out, and our frontend engineers are building the web app for our users. 


This has been a holdup for us, but we will push through together. Thanks for being patient with us.

The other thing that we've been working on alongside is the contracts testing to ensure we cover as many cases as we can to prevent hackers from finding loopholes. As most loans will be loans that takes a lengthy period to complete, we want to be very careful and sure that the contracts are safe and can instill confidence in the users of the protocol. 

Lastly, we also heard you guys out on the feature requests and has made it so that the repayment funds are distributed on the go, meaning redistributed back to the lender everytime a repayment is paid. We've written tests to prove it works in development, but due to it being the step after Lend to Repayment, we havent got to test it on the net yet. 

Thank you for everyone's patience.

Hey Guys, as an effort to get the word out on Ergo, Andy and I discussed a community driven effort promoted by Ergo for an 'Ergo Awareness Day'. The goal would be to get many genuine tweets on this day and hopefully start a snowball effect to bring new members onto the community. We do not want to be 'shilly', so the prompt would be something like 'What are your favorite things about Ergo? or 'What brought you to Ergo?'. 

We also want to get a pool of funds for the top 10 tweets. If you guys are willing to put some into the fund please let me know. 

It will be crucial for all projects on Ergo to participate so I ask that you guys get a tweet or a couple ready for the day. 

It will happen September 15th, a few days before the estimated ETH merge. The hashtag we will use is #DiscoverErgo (tg://search_hashtag?hashtag=DiscoverErgo) although i suggest to also add $ERG which is the classic one used. There will be more information coming as we need to make everyone in the community aware that it is coming! 

Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions üôÇ  @kiidot @Haskell_plus

 It's going well so far. I'm in Goma, DRC working on the incentive model for providers of liquidity. On the programming side, I already have a node running but my internet connection is not reliable enough to make me sit and work. In addition, another task during my visit was to complete the training of 6 students whom I trained remotely on Plutus and smart contracts. I should be back to Canada this week and the Ergo-based preview of Ekival should be live shortly after.

 Haskell basics were required before learning Plutus. I myself do not have all the Plutus syntax figured out but two of the students seem to have memorized a great portion of the documentation.

Having considered the impact of a Beta Test of our platform and ensuring we can do everything to secure confidence in it, and remove as many glitches as possible I believe that for development as soon as our public test is available we will roll out a Beta that has a limited time on repayment of loans, this time period will likely be a month and although it will exclude some of the proposal's we have been working to develop the time period for repayment will allow us to identify issues that might arise and fix them faster than if we allowed for a year or longer, we are looking to get ahead of any possible issues as soo as possible, so as soon as our Devs roll out a Beta please keep in mind that we have Borrowers and Lenders best interest in mind.

P2P has the potential to disrupt the systems that restricts access to people that need financial solutions, and the Exle team is going to find a way to make P2P lending a popular solution in the world.


[09/06/2022 6:55 AM] Haskell_plus#0000

Hi ErgoLend Community,

Lots of work currently being done in Kenya to ensure future generations can profit from the unique ability ErgoLend is bringing to millions - in terms of P2P loans. 

Here is a clip of the government official providing training to all attendees. Making sure the new cooperative is fully compliant with country laws and regulations. 

We‚Äôre establishing a platform to allow ErgoLend to serve the unbanked for generations to come ‚ù§Ô∏è

 It's about trusting people or just wanting to help someone and taking a chance (as lender).
We have alot of goals we want to meet to help someone be successful to find a loan


[09/17/2022 4:04 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
Those goals are down the road


[09/17/2022 4:05 AM] Haskell_plus#0000

[09/17/2022 4:22 AM] GroupAnonymousBot#0000
Ideally we are starting a protocol that allows for a graph to start to emerge. One where different lenders and borrowers are interacting. Over time that graph can be used to help guide with credit worthiness.  All of our code is open source and we really intend to be good stewards of the blockchain and do something that might help people.


[09/17/2022 4:23 AM] GroupAnonymousBot#0000
The graph can also be used by organizations to create reporting that makes it easier to create a community of trust


[09/17/2022 4:24 AM] GroupAnonymousBot#0000

 If you can prove that you can pay it back and that you do (assuming the lender trust that you will) then most probably you could

Just a quick update from the backend dev side. We‚Äôve got our apis written out and will start deployment of the backend to a server and start doing some mainnet testing via the APIs. 

Frontend is getting ramped up. We‚Äôve been able to help some folks in Kenya and the first repayments have been made by them.

If interested in being part of this chapter where we start ramping up and the early birds and pioneers of the projects community and work, please reach out to @Haskell_plus as we sort through the social part of this project together


[09/18/2022 6:17 PM] ChrisHobotnica#0000
Am I right in figuring that as loan demand outstrips the available supply of SigmaUSD, lenders will need to fund the 2% Ergo to SigmaUSD fee in order to bring more into circulation?


[09/18/2022 6:24 PM] ChrisHobotnica#0000
I have feeling the 2% fee (increased from 1% to protect against bearwhale) may prove a high cost impost for efficient micro-loans.


[09/18/2022 6:30 PM] ChrisHobotnica#0000
If Alice wants to lends at 8%, 2% (25%) of the loaned amount needs to be paid to convert from Ergo > SigmaUSD.

What happens when borrower Bob repays: local currency to Ergo, Ergo > SigmaUSD - 2% added to every repayment?


[09/18/2022 6:32 PM] ChrisHobotnica#0000

 What is the cost to swap Ergo on Spectrum?

As we setup to use the stablecoin, the assumption I made is that someone that is already holding stable coins might like to put them to work in a stable environment, also I believe tokenjay is a good place for P2P swaps and as bridged tokens become possible and supported on that app (if ever) than it might be that people would swap for SigUSD just to support a specific project, but ya cost on entry into a stable could surely be considered as someone swaps from $ERG or a token, worth looking at for sure.

 The P2P tooling we are working on is very underestimated, the vision of Exle is aligned with the vision of Satoshi for P2P cryptocurrency and is aligned with the ethos laid out in the Ergo Manifesto, so I believe it is proven and desired - the wallstreet idea of crypto is not the idea we are building, we are creating something that can be used for good and not to line the pockets of the wealthy, the team involved in development is passionate about truly making a difference in the world and participating in providing tools for those that need them most, the rich can build their own tools and if they want an Aav like lending platform I am sure they can find someone to build it - money talks - 
I am continually grateful for the community support and the investor's that have supported us for the last year and joined us in our mission to push power to the edges to provide relief to those seeking it, and the need for P2P finance can be seen in this one small little county in Kenya (Kukama) where our field partners have put in countless hours to provide education in blockchain both Cardano and Ergo and interacting with banking through an exchange, I invite everyone to take a look at the massive workload of proposals awaiting for the Exle platform to be live, after viewing all the proposals please come try to tell me there is not a desire for what we are building - I know that maybe yes, in some places there is no desire for what we are building - but if you look in the right places what we are building is life changing and needed.

 Over 100 proposal's appear to have been worked on waiting to be listed on Exle, from one small county, there is no way that Aave is used by 100 people in that county, this project is more than Aave will ever be, and will outlast Aave and other crypto lending protocols cause its intended to help people, not just the rich.

 Nope. We‚Äôre not doing monthly interest for now. The current version is a straightforward 10% of the whole loan.

For example, you borrow 1000 and set interest at 10%. 

It means you promise to pay back 1100.

It‚Äôs a simple straightforward kind of deal for now. If we want to make it so that it‚Äôs monthly rate later on, we can. But for now, the easiest method (though dev implementation ain‚Äôt as easy even though it‚Äôs a simple implementation) is to do a direct calculation in one go

Thanks for clarifying this Kii. Generally where there‚Äôs interest & principal repaid periodically, an amortizing loan schedule follows. Perhaps to avoid confusion, add to the description something like‚Ä¶ such loans are ‚Äòfixed/constant repayment type‚Äô over the course of the nominated duration.


[10/01/2022 9:28 AM] GroupAnonymousBot#0000
(re @kiidot : *Nope. We‚Äôre not doing monthly interest for now. The current version is a straightforward 10% of the whole loan.

For example, you borrow 1000 and set interest at 10%. 

It means you promise to pay back 1100.

 What's the benefit of using smart contracts here? Imo one needs to trust the borrower to repay the loan in any case. So why not just build a website where people post requests + their wallet and other people agree to give them money? Why do we need smart contracts?

 Then that‚Äôd be a centralized system


[10/02/2022 6:21 AM] kiidot#0000
Exle for v1 is a decentralized bookkeeping system for loans. The contracts ensure that no data can be altered, manipulated or controlled by a centralized entity once it‚Äôs written. Everything runs on the blockchain. All data are stored on the blockchain.


[10/02/2022 6:23 AM] kiidot#0000
And also, P2P is very much a community based effort as mentioned by Chris. We can build all type of credit systems to incorporate trust. But systems can be gamed. 

(We thought of a few systems design and all of it has loopholes. So we want to focus on what is the most functional and can‚Äôt be gamed for the first few versions, while at the same time, reduce the risks that has to be take on by lenders[like crowdfunding])

 Also, a system like that can be more expensive over time.

This is because those requires servers and database to store data. And other expenses that is accrued over time as required when running a centralized company. It‚Äôs centralized bookkeeping vs decentralized bookkeeping. We still have to run the API to allow others and our website to call it. However, the whole system can operate even if there‚Äôs no access to the apis.

Part of our roadmaps are building bots that people can run to help support decentralization of exles system and allow the system to always operate no matter what happens (if people run the bots of course, and of course there are ways to reward them). 

I think lastly is understanding what we have as a component in a bigger system. Our team has been designing the system (the blockchain part) of the system in a Modularized manner. Therefore it‚Äôs almost like a plug and play system for it to grow into something that is more useful and advanced in the future

 Thanks for your answers!

Maybe a stupid question, but wouldn't a NFT do the same job? As I understand it, usual collateralized lending protocols have to use smart contracts, because the collateral needs to be kept in escrow. Since that's not the case with uncollateralized lending, I am wondering whether a smart contract is the right concept, because imo data storage seems to fit NFT solutions as well.


[10/02/2022 7:36 AM] GroupAnonymousBot#0000
Second question, do you think it is good that data about loans is stored forever on the blockchain and everybody can look at it? One benefit of public data is a public credit score/reputation, but the downside is a lack of privacy and dystopian social credit systems. Should there be a right to be forgotten? I think that's especially relevant here, because there is asymmetry. People who need money probably have to provide a lot information, which can be linked to their loans and on-chain data, to get a loan, whereas people who have money and want to lend it don't need to provide any private information.

 No! Thats not a stupid question at all! In fact, that's a good way to think about it and good questions to ask. 

To be honest, I never thought about using NFTs because I didnt understand NFTs enough back then. However I can see where you're coming from on why an NFT can be a good option. It stores data and it is immutable, which makes the whole "storing data" idea sounds like it works entirely well. 

The issue with this comes in the multi level transactions that takes place within the SL (Single lender) system. Or the p2p system in general. 

When you think about the multiple stages that occurs during a loan process. There are multiple parts of the data that are added/manipulated during certain transactions. 

For example, when a loan gets funded, we have to store the lender's PK into the registers so that we know that the loan is funded by this lender and when the automated(techincally not 100% automated, but we can get into this a little later) repayment process happens, the smart contracts ensure that the lender and only the lender can receive the payment. 

This actually helps reduce confusion and thus work for many parties. 
For instance,
1. The borrower only needs to worry about repaying his loans, not needing to worry who he sends the money to.
2. Us developers don't need to worry about the address that he sent to is the correct address (the smart contract does not <clipped message>

[10/02/2022 9:35 PM] kiidot#0000
For sure, feel free to ask questions. These are questions worth discussing. We're gonna start working on designing crowdfunding for the smart contract implementation. 

Once we have a solid document out (it will be posted in our ExIPs) we will share here. At that time, I encourage people to take a look and chime in their opinions if theyd like.


[10/03/2022 7:08 AM] kiidot#0000
Hey guys, if anyone in here are interested or have already participated as lenders for previous loans and want to be participants of the Backend Smart Contract design's User Experience. Please reach out to me! üôÇ

You'll be participating in the designing of the crowd funding pool (specific to loans) where our goals is to reduce the risk and burden for lenders who wants to take part in lending.

The expectations are:
1. Reading through design documentation and identify if the flow seems right.
2. Identify potential flaws or features that needs to be implemented/addressed.

These would largely be conversational based and reviewing of public design documentation that we're writing out (ExIPs).

Once I get a few peeps. I'll create a small chat group to discuss about these implementation.


If anyone's curious. SLT (Single Lender Token) loans V1 is awaiting frontend to be done before beta testing, which is very soon. And the backend development has started designing and implementation of add ons to help both borrowers and lenders user experience and risk mitigation.

 You really make it hard for me to avoid a discussion on how tokenomics designed to manipulate the true value of a projects token can involve staking, you demonstrate the truth though - if we had introduced staking we could have manipulated the price by maintaining stronger investor's presence and duping others to come stake with Exle and inflate it value artificially, staking can be done in the future when holders can propose and vote on such

I don't know if that is a good or bad thing, leaning towards the former though, you tell someone "this project does not believe in staking" which someone not involved in the history of the chat could read as if this project has some central authority and has the ability to introduce staking ethically and change the tokenomics to fit the needs of investors, however, the software developers CANNOT jump in and change tokenomics that investors understood they were getting themselves into without a way for token holders to vote on a proposal correctly.

 I think it's great that you and the remaining team don't want to change tokenomics without vote. 

I think locking tokens/staking makes sense, if there are votes ongoing, because it makes sure that the voters care about the project long-term (because they have their money at stake). I am not sure what to think about staking rewards.

 Staking rewards....tough subject,

JCFishing has caused me to think about this time and time again and if someone else does not come forward with a proposal for it when we use Paideia you can expect one from me, I will make my argument for it then, and a time lock for staking coupled with proof of participation to gain rewards will be part of my proposal.

Tonight I made changes to the loans that I made to our team members in Kenya, I have released them from any further obligation of repayment, I like to call this "Loan Forgiveness", it kind of fits the charitable lending that Exle is all about, for the most part I changed the designation of the funds I provided them cause I believe in the team that has formed in Kenya - secondly: Cause I have a Birthday coming up and I like to gift others instead of receiving gifts - I know I know it was a selfish move, anyway... moving forward I will only be using the contracts the Exle devs provide and will look forward to having the "Loan forgiveness" option available by some new tech maybe we can develop.

 As a form of clarification to other members of this group. Do you mean that you as the owner of the loan will take up the loan responsibility and pay back the loan amount to the other participant lenders?

 Yes, I did that during the raffle where I allowed others to be involved, ultimately though I am responsible for repayment cause the platform was not ready.

 Give it a few minutes for Spectrum to load, I'm not sure what the issue is, been seeing it myself  but my trades go through when I make 3 or 4 requests to trade, when I am buying Exle anyway...
Maybe you should submit a ticket?

[11/26/2022 9:57 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
The only work that needs to be done at this point before public beta is on the front End, integrating all of the UI with calls to the backend to ensure that the UX  makes sense and the contracts work correctly and smoothly for users is where we are now, the app is for the most part being designed to be optimized on mobile devices and IMO as an observer to the development this creates a little bit more work, I am told we are close.

Hey Le Tran, we're working on Frontend and fixing up things like connecting to nautilus wallet, and connecting to ErgoPay and just fixing the logic in general. Though we have some stuff, we're not proud of it yet, cause we're still focusing on the logic. 

Heres a few shots that are more completed though

Smol updates go a long way, we are going to get there.


[11/28/2022 6:45 AM] kiidot#0000
I recently jumped into frontend full force just so that we can move faster, however coming from backend, front end logic can be confusing to me too. 

Fortunately, we're starting to pick up speed and figuring things out. We want to ensure that it can work with ErgoPay due to borrowers from Kenya having access to their phones and would require integration with ErgoPay to use it efficiently, if possible. But we'll improvise as we see fit.

Lastly, though most of our developers have to jump into the frontend, we are very fortunate to have one of our core developers from the backend, @ldgaetano, to continue working on what we call "CrowdFund lend" to design a modularized system to work with the current SLT (Single Lender) system to allow multiple lenders to lend to one loan, thus reducing lending risks and burden a lender has to take on. 

Thanks for everyone patience!

 Yes its alive, our Front End Engineer has been bombarded at work after dealing with tech layoffs, I know its quiet in the chat which does not mean its dead, just quiet.

We are waiting to be able to use Paideia also so there is that, when that happens then this chat might die, cause as I understand it Paideia will have a chat feature (fingers crossed) and so hopefully DAO chats can move over to it where voting will also take place.

One of the features that the UI needs for a public test is to allow for nautilus dapp connector and other wallets to connect to the app. ErgoPay is already working but the site needs to allow for options.
Exle will put up a bounty for a community dev to get nautilus working.


[01/28/2023 5:11 PM] Chris Ray#0000
Let your dev friend know.
1500 SigUSD to add support for nautilus.

Should be able to toggle between ergo pay and nautilus.

The developer will be added to the front end GitHub for Exle
The developer will have to add support via UI and make all changes needed on their local and demo them for completeness.
The developer will make a pull request to our dev branch and we can merge it in and test it in dev environment.
If approved it will be merged to main and the bounty will be paid at that time.

 V.1 is still going to be finished properly before anyone leaves the team tmk, impact I suppose is yet to be determined. 
what would you like to see on the roadmap? I would like to see the community of holders develop the roadmap tbh, I'll stay on my course obviously but ideally with Paideia the holders can control direction of the project, that's just me though, we need proper voting for all of that to happen


[02/09/2023 4:46 PM] GroupAnonymousBot#0000
Yeah after v1 we would like to involve community to make decisions, write up proposals and participate in deciding the future roadmap


[02/09/2023 4:50 PM] stannn4#0000
Do you have proposals ?


[02/09/2023 5:23 PM] vidicmu2301#0000
Can we use the $ from treasury to hire someone manage the project? We need someone can make a usable product first then start proposing from there, right? We contributed our $ for the IDO, its not community driven project at this point IMO.


[02/09/2023 5:46 PM] GroupAnonymousBot#0000
the product that we have is usable - was only working with ergo pay and were about to finish up nautiuls support - we have a PR up that is being worked on.

then its a matter of QA and there are some new  features for funding that I think might be complete on the backend now as well

 Do you remember what address you contributed with? I repaid most of the loan but that was before the raffle received updates and it was kind of confusing the way the UI worked, I can go look to find your address to see where you stand though, if you want to DM me it I am ok making a search.

 Well ya, after someone.... wanted it to be opened up longer, so I left it open for a significant time, lol! Now I have a huge airdrop mess I get to sort through -I will get there though, looking how I can make it fun for those that I am excluding and maybe let them in somehow (Not for the initial but maybe a future) I dunno yet what I am going to do exactly - I will work through it when I have the attention span to do so.

[03/08/2023 2:02 PM] GroupAnonymousBot#0000
@Haskell_plus any updates about development? I put $2000 to exle because i wanted to see your platform built and provide value to people.

What is status of dev? How much funds are left in treasury? Are efforts being made to acquire services from a new dev to finish the project? Bit frustrated recently with how things have turned out


[03/08/2023 2:03 PM] GroupAnonymousBot#0000

 I hear you, there are several things I need to do before it can be launched publicly and I am insanely busy outside of Exle, I want it to get off the ground more than anybody else does I am sure and it is my own actions that have put Exle into a difficult position, making team decisions has become an issue that is complex and hard to navigate - dev status is the UI dev needs to find time to review

I hear you, there are several things I need to do before it can be launched publicly and I am insanely busy outside of Exle, I want it to get off the ground more than anybody else does I am sure and it is my own actions that have put Exle into a difficult position and so I am sure I am a bit more bothered than anyone else is concerning its status, making team decisions has become an issue that is complex and hard to navigate - 
dev status is the UI dev needs to find time to review bounty work done to add nautilus support and then merge it to main if it passes QA, the Backend dev has committed to deliver a usable v.1
Planned for and unexpected life events are affecting development rate and I apologize for this, it is the environment we are in
However, I have been in discussion about the state of the platform and there are options that can be looked at, the whole project will benefit when it can utilize Paieia   to make decisions and approve cost's, please have some patience.
Treasury status is: 66,122 ERG 48,745 SigUSD along with the Exle initially set aside for the DAO and also any other tokens like SPF that are finding there way into the addresses.

[03/09/2023 5:40 AM] lyndon_b#0000
Thanks for the update Chris. 

Whilst I appreciate the decentralised purest view of wait for the Paideia DAO - I'm of the view that if it's possible get the MVP launched and then some of the finer details/configs can be voted on when paideia is available. 

EXLE has lost it's first mover advantage and yes, it a slightly different lending offering  - however it's at risk of becoming obsolete if nothing is delivered in the near future.


[03/09/2023 2:25 PM] vidicmu2301#0000

 There is a task that I would like to explore: Exle is in need of someone to maintain the Backend, this process of transitioning from the OG BE dev to a onboarded maintainer that would join the core team to assist in product success is a task  I am not familiar with and Exle community members could assist in the transition in my opinion, the complications that could arise appear to be multi faceted based on my previous experience , if someone from our community could maintain the backend (with proper compensation) and they are competent to do so, let's begin the conversation if possible.

 Exle has no current competition imo, the platform is designed to be a hub for P2P interactions where users can engage in P2P contracts utilizing blockchain tech to record agreements on an open ledger and the information recorded on the ledger through the contract  is immutable - show me how EXLE has lost first mover advantage there is noone seeking to provide uncollateralized loans and putting in the work to push power to the edges - that I know of - Exle will continue to seek solutions to provide a platform where people that have nothing to offer as collateral can seek opportunity to financially strengthen their personal living conditions.

Please show me a project that is driving towards uncollateralized lending and I will eat my words.

PSA:
I am going to be brutally honest here:
Investors that utilized the ErgoPad distribution likely have no clear idea of how much impact Exle potentially can have in developing market's to change lives and create hope for the unbanked that have strong trust in the communities they reside in (not all of the investors, just some that are dumping), I believe the value of EXLE has been weighed on development - not the mission, when Paideia is live for DAO governance and uncountable people submit loan request's P2P through the platform I believe it will shine, it was designed for the people and it has been designed correctly to serve the people that seek to obtain the same banking privilege's that the developed countries of the world indulge in, Exle will maintain a Decentralized Purist approach to development as long as I am involved in pushing it forward unless the community ask's me to step aside -which you can do at any time - decentralize this

Looking to the future the BE has exciting updates that should have been in the last weekly developer update on Wednesday - However I have been extremely busy as have the rest of the team.
I will que it up and submit it this Wednesday.

1. CrowdFund(CF) Contract 1st Draft

2. The Vision For Rural Kenya team has successfully navigated the dev environment and has posted several loan request's to it, they have also been successful navigating the Minotaur wallet.

3. UI (today) is stalled due to life interference, this happens, everyone involved with Exle development has full time positions they are relying on to provide for them selves, hope is to see Grand Gambits Nautilus integration soon.


Crowdfunding will provide more access to funds for borrowers as they can get many people involved in their cause and not rely on one wealthy contributor, the Ergo Raffle is a good example of how successful crowd funding can be.

[04/12/2023 12:45 AM] kiidot#0000
Hi. I‚Äôll help provide some update for Chris to provide more clarity to everyone, alongside that this may be the last update from me.

TL;DR the P2P contracts are going through some small updates to accommodate V2 (CrowdFunding) 

In the past 2 months, we‚Äôve been working on developing V2 (CrowdFunding) for the current P2P system (V1). As designs are made to be modular for future scalability of the contracts, we were designing crowdfund to be entirely independent but works with the P2P loan contracts. 

3 weeks ago, the clients from Kenya were ready to made some loans. However, it requires a small update in the P2P contracts to allow it to work seamlessly. We had to make a difficult decisions on whether to stop the loans to be funded first so we can do a quick upgrade and thus ensure a leaner system or whether we should allow V1 to move forward and having to build the backend to be able to handle both an outdated P2P and a newer P2p version that works with the Crowdfunding feature. From the lack of updates, the answer was clear. I made the decision to delay the release for P2P by 3 weeks to a month so that we can reduce tech debt for the DAO. 

The current update in whole is that P2P is 99% ready, and the backend of crowdfund should be done by the end of this month (backend does not include the frontend and UI). However, due to a small bug in terms of box costing due to the size of the bytes of the box to work with CrowdFund, there is one more thing I have to fix for P2P to work seamlessly with CrowdFund, whereas apis of the backend of crowdfund feature is being live tested at the same time (which is how we found the bug).

Some concerns may be, what would happen if new features would need to be added to P2P again. Does that mean the whole system needs to be shut down again?

This is not for me to decide as mentioned in the past, I will be pursuing other things, and therefore I won‚Äôt be the one  <clipped message>


[04/12/2023 3:06 AM] GroupAnonymousBot#0000
As soon as the backend is usable I'll jump in and finish the crowdfunding front end.

We are also anticipating a scala dev will give us the tx format we need so we can accommodate browser wallets.

        You anon types in this channel can hardly get a conversation started huh? üòâ

I want to second your proposal A.
I suggest it go to a 45 day voting period in the Exle discord with a Yes or No option and only discord users that have 4/30/23 or before date in the channel can vote, I would suggest 80% of all the Exle treasury ERG and other assets be utilized to increase the value the future Paideia contributors will have to work with be put into building the treasury - the current liquidity on spectrum should remain untouched.
The remaining 20% at time of vote creation I recommend be reserved for development bounties.

On your proposal B: I suggest that it be brought forward after voting on Yield is complete, if a No vote on proposal A is realized than a percentage of the treasury could be voted on to go toward such things and Exle holders will benefit from contributing to strengthening the network the platform utilizes.

        I proposed you should finish your endless reluctant and disappointing project instead of living on other funds without delivering anything

What is the status of this project? Will the token ever be used for anything?

Oh nice, thanks. Would be great to get some updates from the team too.


[04/29/2023 8:44 AM] muffinator#5168
Agreed they can be really bad at communicating stuff

In general, V1 is up and running and open to a few now. Frontend is waiting on integrating json transactions for nautilus to work before they pushed it to the public. 

Crowdfund for backend is done, and frontend will look into integrating that next.

Kenya has requested for first loan, kushti has provided the interest free loan to them.

More loans will be coming. 

That's all I've got. Future communications will be done by @Haskell_plus or someone else. Thanks

Hey #CardanoCommunity & #Ergo Community

I‚Äôm happy to confirm that, together with @ErgoLend, my team have successfully issued the first two P2P loans.

Lots of work and energy went into making this possible. Kudos to @Haskell_plus Kushti, Kiidot, @NFTnode @johneyanae5

No problem. Thanks for being patient. It must have been super frustrating from you guys side. Appreciate your kind understanding.
