Discord bots work on Tg but not the other way :(


[04/11/2023 2:01 PM] drehaf#0090
i have this as a discord bot too


[04/11/2023 2:02 PM] drehaf#0090
i mean, it's all a web api and the bots just pass stuff to and from it


[04/11/2023 2:02 PM] drehaf#0090
there are limitations of that but also advantages as it's easy to have something else use it

Hm, I switched my chatbot to gpt-4 and most of the bugs vanished. Will tidy up the ErgoLLM directory and write a tutorial on how to run that part locally. 

Not sure what the best option for the web is. Let people enter their API keys? Charge? Pitch for funding via an ErgoRaffle as marketing? Would be great to have a free one open to all, but people would spam it and would quickly rack up thousands of $

(re @glasgowm : *Hm, I switched my chatbot to gpt-4 and most of...*)
        
        bot here could ask for API key and bind it to account yeah, thats a pretty good idea. I was going to purchase gpt4 for work anyway for a faculty member. how much do you think the bill would be if people used it for accessing help docs etc?


[04/12/2023 2:20 PM] glasgowm#0000
Solana guy said he was stopping his as it hit $800, and his was only trained on 1 repo I believe. So lots probably 😛

Not sure if that was GPT4 or not though. 

Suppose another option is waiting for the open source stuff to mature a bit.

Ask HN: Open source LLM for commercial use?
Working on a ML project and looking for an open source LLM that can be used in a commercial environment. As far as I'm aware, products cannot be built on LLAMA.I don't want to use GPT since the project will be using personal information to train/fine tune the models.

        u don't think 3.5-turbo can ingest and respond well enough?


[04/12/2023 2:27 PM] glasgowm#0000
even 4 is still quite error prone. Maybe not trained well enough yet though. turbo would probably be fine but this chatbot in particular doesnt seem to like anything but gpt4

https://github.com/context-labs/toly-gpt which is based on https://github.com/hwchase17/chat-langchain

Their webUI has the same bug though it seems, so probably not my setup.

There’s also https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT but it has it’s own issues (code formatting ugly, links aren’t hyperlinked, etc). 

Maybe need to wait for a more robust option to become available, unless it’s out there already and I’ve missed it.

"However, a recent report from Semafor suggests his feud with OpenAI is more personal. In 2018, Musk reportedly told Sam Altman, one his fellow co-founders at OpenAI, the lab was falling too far behind Google. Musk then suggested that he should be the one to run the firm, a proposal Altman and OpenAI’s other founders rejected."

@openai_bot Why does Ergo use 'Coll' instead of Array?


[05/01/2023 1:14 PM] openai_bot#6772
According to the conversation, "Coll is used instead of Array to remind that its different internally from Scala" and "Coll[Byte] is ordered. Its like Array[Byte] of Scala". Essentially, the use of the term 'Coll' is a way to indicate that it is a collection type that has certain internal differences from the standard Array type in Scala. Coll is a type that is part of the Ergo Platform and is often used in the ErgoTree, which is a serialization of a script that runs on the Ergo blockchain. If you are interested in learning more about how 'Coll' is used in Ergo, you can check out the Ergo Platform repository on GitHub, specifically the ErgoTree module, which uses 'Coll' extensively in its code.

@openai_bot Why does Ergo use 'Coll' instead of Array?


[05/01/2023 1:16 PM] openai_bot#6772
According to scalahub#2618 on June 8th, 2021 at 5:59 PM, "Coll is used instead of Array to remind that its different internally from Scala." They also mentioned earlier that "Coll[Byte] is ordered. its like Array[Byte] of Scala."

In Ergo, Collection (Coll) is the base trait for all collection-like data structures used in the ErgoScript language. As mentioned, it is used instead of the default Scala Array to signify that it is different internally from Scala. Coll is designed to simplify the creation and manipulation of complex data structures, especially those involving nested collections.

You can find more information about the Coll trait in Ergo in the ErgoScript specification on GitHub, specifically in the Collection Types section: https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergoscript/blob/master/docs/ergoscript.pdf#page=37
