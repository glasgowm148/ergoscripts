hi Discord


[03/16/2022 9:37 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Didn't know a Satergo discord (channel) exists. Where can I find it?


[03/16/2022 9:42 PM] REROLABS#0000
Sir ask Glasgow to bridge discord in here (re @Gstoiti: Didn't know a Satergo discord (channel) exists...)


[03/16/2022 10:01 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Sir, but which discord? Can't find a satergo discord channel in the wallet section (re @REROLABS: Sir ask Glasgow to bridge discord in here)


[03/16/2022 10:22 PM] mewtoshi#0000
Glasgow contacted me to add the bot if I want him to create a channel for Satergo


[03/16/2022 10:23 PM] mewtoshi#0000
It has not been created yet

yea, they even ignored the appeal i sent for the sub, only got a "we have received your appeal"
and the sub ban was also random, no notification or email, they just deleted it and put a text on the page saying suspended

Satoshi or Saturn, you choose. I won't tell the original idea (:

I'm neutral on the name honestly, I like Saturn though, Satoshi is too related to Bitcoin

It's not the best name, but quite good in my opinion. If I would have waited more, there still would have been no name at this point. I'm also starting more ergo-related projects under "The Satergo project" btw

[04/23/2022 9:07 PM] Gstoiti#0000
> Gstoiti re @mewtoshi: But would it make sense? Methmask is for other... 
 
 Yeah, but there is a huge discussion in crypto communities (esp. Cardano) that that can happen also on other chains with light wallets and node wallets are one way to be safe. Also other chains (like Cardano) only got one node wallet which isn't great. Hence, pointing to Satergo as a user-friendly community developed node wallet makes totally sense. That's why I think citing a tweet about the metamask problems and highligthing the benefits of full node like Satergo would be marketing + information.


[04/28/2022 8:25 PM] Satergo#0000

 You should check out the alephium wallet I really like their ui and ux

[05/21/2022 5:16 PM] Gstoiti#0000
I think there are enough users for multiple node wallets and competition is good for the ecosystem and decentralization.


[05/21/2022 5:22 PM] Satergo#0000
God...

 Can't say I am happy with this 😂


[05/21/2022 5:23 PM] Satergo#0000
Does he know Satergo exists?


[05/21/2022 5:24 PM] Gstoiti#0000
You could ask him to work together? Otherwise it might be a good time to start marketing 😅

[05/21/2022 5:25 PM] Armeanio#0000

 Will check, will also check WavesFX which I found a few months ago


[05/21/2022 5:32 PM] Satergo#0000
I have a separate Ergo project which will further enhance the node integration in the user interface btw

 I showed him and he didn't, he seemed dissappointed


[05/21/2022 6:17 PM] NoahErgo#0000
told him you guys should just work together


[05/21/2022 6:18 PM] NoahErgo#0000
@mewtoshi you can find him in the node channel on the ergo discord


[05/21/2022 6:18 PM] Satergo#0000
I don't use discord


[05/21/2022 6:19 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Is this channel bridged?


[05/21/2022 6:20 PM] Satergo#0000
I asked Glasgow in PMs


[05/21/2022 6:20 PM] NoahErgo#4349

[05/21/2022 6:20 PM] NoahErgo#4349

[05/21/2022 6:20 PM] Satergo#0000
Ok


[05/21/2022 6:23 PM] NoahErgo#0000
this could be a good thing if you guys team up to work on this


[05/21/2022 6:24 PM] Satergo#0000
Sure he or she can help but I'm not sure with what


[05/21/2022 6:43 PM] cheese#5545
Hi guys, sorry I didn't mean to cause a problem or anything. I just wanted a full node desktop wallet to help with decentralization and get more people running full nodes. I'd love to help on Satergo.


[05/21/2022 6:44 PM] Satergo#0000
No problem was caused :)
I had the same wish when I started Satergo, it's nice to see like-minded people.


[05/21/2022 6:46 PM] Satergo#0000
You can definitely help but are you familiar with the stack we use? Java as programming language and JavaFX as the UI library


[05/21/2022 6:54 PM] Satergo#0000
It would be amazing if you are interested to help really. My skills in UI design are not the best to say the least


[05/21/2022 6:56 PM] cheese#5545
So if I'm being honest, when I was planning out my node development path I really considered writing it in Java and using JavaFX because the node is run with java, so it seemed like a no-brainer. I've used JavaFX in the past and wasn't a huge fan but I'm down to give it another shot! I ended up choosing electron js as my window framework. I'm a software engineer by trade and we use a variety of languages but we actually mainly use Java to run our systems so I'm rather familiar.


[05/21/2022 6:57 PM] cheese#5545
Yeah choosing electron js was heavily impacted by it's ability to create a slick UI. I figured I was creating a node desktop wallet for people who can't or don't want to go through the process of setting up the basic node so the UI should be very easy and friendly to use


[05/21/2022 6:58 PM] cheese#5545
I'd love to help in an capacity and at any level of Satergo


[05/21/2022 6:58 PM] cheese#5545
I like ergo 👍


[05/21/2022 7:01 PM] Satergo#0000
If you know it well, you can do stunning UIs in any UI framework. The problem is, I don't have the knowledge to know what to make. I'm really happy that you are interested in helping


[05/21/2022 7:02 PM] Satergo#0000
Do you have Telegram? It would be easier to chat in private messages


[05/21/2022 7:41 PM] NoahErgo#4349
Very happy I was able to bring you guys together 🙂 @cheese if you are on telegram let me know and i can share the satergo channel with you there too


[05/21/2022 8:26 PM] Gstoiti#0000

[05/21/2022 8:31 PM] cheese#5545
That's maybe the thing, I've just JavaFX but not enough to be able to do anything crazy on the fly. Doesn't mean I can't get there though :)


[05/21/2022 8:31 PM] cheese#5545
So I have telegram out of necessity but I'm not familiar with it at all. I'll see if I can figure out how to get us connected there


[05/21/2022 8:39 PM] cheese#5545
I'm sorry, it seems like I maybe need to share my phone number to get added on telegram. If I set a username can I be added that way?

Idk didnt you say you had improved it a bunch since 0.0.2


[05/21/2022 9:05 PM] Satergo#0000
Yeah, but it is in the middle of a change right now so not compilable


[05/21/2022 9:05 PM] Satergo#0000
Next week? I believe


[05/21/2022 9:06 PM] NoahErgo#0000

Just a heads up, I probably won't be able to really check out the code until sometime early next week. I think I saw some open issues on git though


[05/21/2022 9:08 PM] Satergo#0000
There's 1 issue that's kinda wontfix since it is not on Satergo's part. It might have gotten fixed though, I have no idea

 Thank you so much
Also I noticed that left over from the old translation
translatedIntoThisLanguageBy_s=Перевод на Русский by %s
As far as I know "b" (in the word by) isn't a russian letter? And I don't think Русский should start with a capital according to Russian writing rules?


[05/22/2022 3:13 PM] ibetuwill#0000
Yes, "b" isn't a russian letter.
It's not so important which one you choose:
"Перевод на Русский"
or
"Перевод на русский".
The 2nd looks more russian like, that's all

 That would be great, could make satergo the goto wallet for miners and make mining  adoption that much easier.

Solo stratum or something to avoid fees.

Pool support and integration of diff miners? Srb, t-rex etc?


[05/28/2022 3:55 AM] Firestar916#0000
Dont know if that'd be possible


[05/28/2022 4:01 AM] Arohbe#0000
(re @Firestar916 : *Pool support and integration of diff miners? Srb, t-rex etc?*) 
 
 No the stratum server is what the miner would connect to.  It can be built locally if people want to solo mine.   Complicated for many


[05/28/2022 4:02 AM] Firestar916#0000
Ah ok. Gotcha, yeah. I'd imagine for larger scale operations that'd be ideal too.


[05/28/2022 4:02 AM] Arohbe#0000
Mining software possibly as well.  There are some OS miners but they need alot of optimization


[05/28/2022 3:53 PM] Satergo#0000

Ok


[05/31/2022 2:16 PM] Satergo#0000
The new wallet format features an abstract key section that makes it possible to access the coins in any way defined. This could even be extended by plugins.


[05/31/2022 2:17 PM] Satergo#0000
The standard key is the local one which encrypts the private key into the wallet file itself


[05/31/2022 2:18 PM] Satergo#0000
There will also be a view-only one, ledger, remote bluetooth but not in this release


[05/31/2022 2:18 PM] Satergo#0000
And nfc is also a possibility, for laptops that support it. Quite smooth


[05/31/2022 2:19 PM] Satergo#0000
It is easy to extend with a plugin, for any Java developer

[06/09/2022 10:12 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @Gstoiti : *@mewtoshi Is there a way to choose which address is used as input in the current version of the wallet?*) 
 
 No


[06/09/2022 10:13 PM] Satergo#0000
This feature isn't available in the next version either


[06/09/2022 10:13 PM] Satergo#0000
Want me to add it?


[06/09/2022 10:16 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Would be cool for Ergo Nation. Because people might want to use one of the addresses as ID address and then they would need to make sure that they send from this address to get their vote/transaction counted.


[06/09/2022 10:17 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Activation of that feature could also be hidden somewhere in the settings to avoid confusing new users.


[06/09/2022 10:17 PM] Satergo#0000
Is the vote ERG or a token?


[06/09/2022 10:18 PM] Gstoiti#0000
It's Erg


[06/09/2022 10:19 PM] Satergo#0000
Ok


[06/09/2022 10:19 PM] Satergo#0000
just wondered


[06/09/2022 10:20 PM] Gstoiti#0000
It's not that important, but if it isn't hard to add that would be very cool.


[06/09/2022 10:20 PM] Satergo#0000
Shouldn't be hard. I already have an idea on how to implement it in an easy-to-use way


[06/09/2022 10:22 PM] Satergo#0000
One would choose which addresses are possible to select from and obviously choosing only one limits it to that one


[06/09/2022 10:22 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Btw are excess Erg from transactions always sent back to the sending address? E.g. if address A holds 0.5 Erg (in one box) and I send 0.3 to address B from address A, are the remaining 0.2 Erg always returned to address A?

 I believe it is sent to the master (first) address


[06/09/2022 10:25 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Ok, thanks will check that


[06/09/2022 10:26 PM] Satergo#0000
I checked the code and it is sent to master address, quite dumb imo

I was sure I have sent from derived addresses and change went back to those derived address not my first address


[06/09/2022 10:27 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
I must have been imagining things


[06/09/2022 10:27 PM] Satergo#0000
Probably because there's nothing in the code that would do that


[06/09/2022 10:28 PM] Gstoiti#0000
For the ID address it would be cool if excess funds would be returned to the same address (or if one could choose)


[06/09/2022 10:28 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
Thinking about it, I don't really use derived addresses for big transactions that I would actually look into


[06/09/2022 10:29 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
So makes sense I never noticed


[06/09/2022 10:32 PM] Satergo#0000
What's more interesting to me is that you use satergo :O :)


[06/09/2022 10:43 PM] Satergo#0000
Is it like you want?

It seems ergo developers created a weird release which confuses it


[06/10/2022 12:49 AM] Satergo#0000
It needs to be done manually now......until i add support for this weird thing

I'll skip NFT viewing for this release because the wallet format has changed so much that I'm worried the approach of NFT caching will be done incorrectly.

Not sure if anybody knows about its existence but the `ergo:` internet URI handler has been in Satergo for a while. It was planned to be included in 0.0.3 but it seems better fit bundled in an upcoming installer instead.


[06/13/2022 1:04 PM] Satergo#0000
Any opinions on the mnemonic repetition screen? What could be better with it? I added keyboard navigation (arrow keys) just now but it seems painful if you miss a word or accidentally deselect one after you've selected few others after it

(re @mewtoshi : *Any opinions on the mnemonic repetition screen? What could be better with it? I added keyboard navigation (arrow keys) just now but it seems painful if you miss a word or accidentally deselect one after you've selected few others after it*) 
 
 I like the repetition screen of the mobile wallet, because it only asks for 2 random words and so it is less annoying to create wallets, but probably also less safe for beginners

(re @Gstoiti : *I like the repetition screen of the mobile wallet, because it only asks for 2 random words and so it is less annoying to create wallets, but probably also less safe for beginners*) 
 
 When thinking further, it shouldn't be a problem that you need to enter all words. The reason I got annoyed is probably because I create looots of wallets when testing


[06/13/2022 11:51 PM] Satergo#0000
For the transaction history, should an individual listing be shown for each tokens from an input and to an output or only a summary of all input, all outputs and total?

José what I mean is for example a friend sends you 90 sigUSD. He has those as 30 in address 1, 30 in addr 2, 30 in addr 3. Should it show for each input address or just a summary of all inputs


[06/14/2022 6:36 PM] Satergo#0000
Or both?

 I think the best is to have the simplest option

(re @Ubayyww : *maybe this is interesting, but this still needs a lot of input*) 
 
 It is not a bad design but it fits for a popup like in a browser. It doesn't really fit a desktop program window


[06/22/2022 10:31 PM] Ubayyww#0000
right sir. i also think the design is for extentions in crome


[06/22/2022 11:15 PM] EbolaGranola#0000
I think a good place to start for design is to ask a few questions, some of which I can definitely answer myself by going through the repo

1. What features are currently available?
2. What features are expected to be added in the future?
3. How much of the backend info do you want exposed to the end user?
4. What features will be used the most and should be easily accessible?
5. What features will be used the least and can be hidden away?


[06/22/2022 11:16 PM] EbolaGranola#0000
I'm willing to mock some stuff up after I see what the code looks like. I already had a design idea for my own full node wallet

[06/24/2022 3:49 PM] Satergo#0000
The issue is that the jdk download for MacOS is different so the linking tool doesn't understand it and instead uses the jdk it was run from, in this case being 64 bit gnu/linux..

Since the release I have added one feature so far and that is offline mode, when you have no internet connection instead of getting "an unexpected error" you get a limited view of your wallet where you can basically only manage addresses, mnemonic and password

 I really like the new features and I had no problems to install it on Windows 10. 

I have two remarks/proposals:

1) The max price chart should start on 1 July 2019 (date of start of mainnet). The price chart before that date is showing the price of the Ergo First Year Token . Unfortunately, basically every chart includes the chart of the first year token, but it is wrong.

2) Since it is now possible to require the password for sending, it would be very cool if one could stay logged into multiple wallets at the same time and switch between them (e.g. via a column on the left side). Furthermore, turning "Require password for sending" off/on should require the password.


[06/26/2022 10:44 PM] NoahErgo#0000
seems transaction history does work, but required restart of the wallet

 Ok, it's not important imo. But changing the setting for password requirement when sending should require the password.

@NoahErgo could it be so that you tried to send before the sync was finished?


[06/27/2022 8:43 PM] NoahErgo#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *@NoahErgo could it be so that you tried to send before the sync was finished?*) 
 
 Seemed that it had finished syncing to the last block. Said 0 blocks left


[06/28/2022 12:21 AM] glasgowm#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *@glasgowm were you able to send a tx on your wallet on mac?*)

[06/28/2022 1:46 PM] Satergo#0000
Yeah I didn't put much effort into the chart. I should make it so the time period preference (24h etc) is saved and I could add the 24h, 7d and 30d % change


[06/28/2022 1:49 PM] Satergo#0000
And dark theme of course


[06/28/2022 2:09 PM] kushti#0000

@MrStahlfelge is appkit supporting custom scans?


[06/28/2022 2:14 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @kushti_ru : *Good work sir*) 
 
 Thank you :)


[06/28/2022 2:46 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
if scans are added with node rest api, the whole rest api is available in appkit


[06/28/2022 5:36 PM] RC_willaskseedphrase#0000
is it possible to make the .bat an .exe with the erg logo when it first starts up? would like to pin the wallet to my taskbar

if not, I understand. just asking


[06/29/2022 8:13 AM] Satergo#0000
Not at the moment. I wanted to create an installer but it requires many things. I would have to create the installer on Windows, which I don't use. I would have to figure out a way to do updates because when you have an installer it deletes all settings when you update. It is my intention to use the installer for ergo: URI scheme but there are some unclear parts if this can be edited with updates etc


[06/30/2022 3:25 PM] Satergo#0000
I found a perfect name for ergosock (library to connect to nodes).....

Lol in socket development sock is sometimes used (for example sockopt) so my bad creativity chose that name 👍


[06/30/2022 3:28 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000

Guys I believe Satergo's versioning is weird. Usually 0.0.x updates are small and stable software is 1.x.x+

 I made a comment (and shilled your ErgoHack 3rd place). Would be cool if others could also comment and upvote. 

Running nodes is important for the network, but many think it is difficult, because they don't know about Satergo.

Aberg, I can't figure out some things:

1) when I choose "full node" mode, the wallet synchronizes blockchain for about 1 hour (very fast tbh), but the node folder doesn't weigh even 1 Gb. I heard that the full node is about 16 Gb. Is it ok?

2) I was trying to restore my telegram wallet, but it didn't show any balance and my address either. It could be my mistake in any word of mnemonic. I will give it a try again later

3) Will be there an "update" button? 
It would be great to press "update", reboot the wallet and it's new.
Or should I download on GitHub and replace all the files with every new version?

Those questions may be stupid, I am not a programmer at all. My skills end on Excell, I can combine 2 cells :D

 1) I believe the database folder is hidden so it could be that your file explorer doesn't include it

2) Are you on the correct network? (Mainnet or testnet? This could also be the reason for 1.) If you are then there is another possibility that I know of

3) When there is a new update you get a popup but it just opens your browser. I will look into adding proper 1-click updates

 The only dev is @mewtoshi. Just ask and he or someone else will answer 🙂


[07/06/2022 2:27 PM] question86#0000
So i downloaded satergo recently, added a new wallet for test, sended 1 erg as test and it showed up -


[07/06/2022 2:30 PM] question86#0000
After this i decided to go for it and deleted the software from my test environment to install it on pc, downloaded full chain, created a new wallet again (full node mode) and it popped up - i stored seed.


[07/06/2022 2:31 PM] question86#0000
Next step was i added a new address (#1) and sended like 50% of my usecase wallets erg plus several tokens to the newly generated address.


[07/06/2022 2:32 PM] question86#0000
since the transaction didnt show up in my wallet, i restarted the node via satergo software, didnt work. I then closed the node and started the run.bat again.


[07/06/2022 2:33 PM] question86#0000
the new address (#1) was not shown when i restarted and it just never came up again


[07/06/2022 2:33 PM] question86#0000
i guess all my shit is lost now, isnt it?


[07/06/2022 2:34 PM] question86#0000
tried to restore the wallet with the seed in nautilus, found the wallet address #0 (master) but not #1


[07/06/2022 2:34 PM] Gstoiti#0000
did you check the address in the explorer?


[07/06/2022 2:34 PM] question86#0000

thats the one i received from satergo as #1 address


[07/06/2022 2:35 PM] question86#0000
#0 was master its this one 9iEqk6385LPbW8qD9HbUqEeZpwLLaECEfLbRsjPnrHiKBuSptFe


[07/06/2022 2:36 PM] question86#0000
i wonder how it cant find my #1.. never had this issue with any other wallet


[07/06/2022 2:39 PM] Gstoiti#0000
I am sure your funds aren't lost, if you took the address from the wallet. But I don't know how Satergo generates them.

Just a few guesses/things to check:
- Is your wallet synced 100%?
- If you generate addresses, do you get a new #1 address? Did you try to generate a few more addresses?
- Did you try to restore your seed in Satergo?
- Are you sure you opened the correct wallet file (xyz.erg)?


[07/06/2022 2:40 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Does Nautilus show your master address?


[07/06/2022 2:40 PM] question86#0000
(re @Gstoiti : *Does Nautilus show your master address?*) 
 
 yup


[07/06/2022 2:40 PM] Gstoiti#0000

 Sorry, just read your comment above

 1: yes 2) yes 3) yes 4) no, the wallet address might be corrupted


[07/06/2022 2:41 PM] question86#0000
the wallet file


[07/06/2022 2:44 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Hmm, it's very strange that your address doesn't show up again. Not at my computer atm, so I can't check what could be the problem. But I will dm Aberg


[07/06/2022 2:45 PM] question86#0000
it seems as if the wallet created a random address for me but did not store it somehow, so thats why nautilus not showing it either


[07/06/2022 2:46 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Yeah, but the addresses are derived from your seed phrase. So using the same algorithm you should always get the same addresses


[07/06/2022 2:47 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Did you use a mnemonic password when generating the wallet?


[07/06/2022 2:47 PM] question86#0000
nope


[07/06/2022 2:48 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Did you compare your new #1 address with the address with the funds? Just to make sure there was no typo.


[07/06/2022 2:49 PM] question86#0000
#1 is completely different to the funds


[07/06/2022 2:50 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Is your new #1 address the same one as the first derived address in Nautilus?


[07/06/2022 2:51 PM] question86#0000
yes


[07/06/2022 2:51 PM] question86#0000
this part looks good


[07/06/2022 2:51 PM] question86#0000

[07/06/2022 2:59 PM] question86#0000
fixed


[07/06/2022 2:59 PM] question86#0000
it was my bad obviously, the .erg was somehow corrupted and the "old" .erg was still in place


[07/06/2022 3:00 PM] question86#0000
since i saved it before i uninstalled from my test environment & portet it over without thinking


[07/06/2022 3:00 PM] question86#0000
just fresh start fixed it


[07/06/2022 3:00 PM] question86#0000
delete & reinstall completely

 How was it corrupted?


[07/06/2022 3:02 PM] question86#0000
I did a testrun and took the old .erg with me after i close the testcase and opened a new fresh wallet


[07/06/2022 3:02 PM] question86#0000
i took the test .erg and copied it brainless to the new node environment and therefore got bad addresses


[07/06/2022 3:02 PM] question86#0000
for my non-test wallet


[07/06/2022 3:03 PM] Satergo#0000
That sounds like it should have worked


[07/06/2022 3:03 PM] Satergo#0000
Because the .erg file format contains all the information needed, the system doesn't matter


[07/06/2022 3:03 PM] question86#0000
it did but i made a transaction to the new wallet meanwhile and wondered why the addresses i got after the copy + paste move where different


[07/06/2022 3:04 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Ah, so you sent to the new wallet, but checked in the old wallet?


[07/06/2022 3:04 PM] question86#0000
so it was like 1) opened test wallet 2) opened clean new wallet 3) made a transaction to the new clean wallet 4) ported the .erg from test wallet to the new envi 5) got bad results for my addresses


[07/06/2022 3:05 PM] Satergo#0000
Oh


[07/06/2022 3:05 PM] question86#0000
logical capitulation at my side


[07/06/2022 3:05 PM] Satergo#0000

[07/06/2022 3:05 PM] Satergo#0000

 you mean run.sh ? that just opens the file...

 Fixed it. But now when I double click the file - it offers the options: run/run in terminal - but choosing any one of them leads to nothing…

 Funds are safu this is just because the sync bar shows headers not blocks so just wait a while with the node running so it actually syncs the blocks as well. This will be changed in the next version

[07/18/2022 10:20 PM] Satergo#0000
So the progress bar used to show header sync progress which caused confusion because it gave the impression of the node being fully synced when in reality blocks maybe were not. So I switched it to show blocks, but now the progress bar doesn't move until all headers are synced which makes you think that it has frozen.

Does anybody have an idea what to do? Having the progress bar show headers first then blocks when headers are done would make the user think that it broke and restarted


[07/18/2022 10:21 PM] Satergo#0000
I think this is only a problem at first sync but still a problem


[07/18/2022 10:22 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Text in/above the progress bar. First "Syncing headers" then "Syncing blocks"


[07/18/2022 10:22 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Then people know that it didn't restart


[07/18/2022 10:34 PM] Satergo#0000
Sounds sensible but will people understand? For example many people confuse network and wallet sync on Monero. Different types of sync is confusing


[07/18/2022 10:39 PM] Gstoiti#0000
I think some might not know what's the difference, but at least they will understand that there is a difference and the wallet didn't freeze. And I think that's ok for most people.


[07/18/2022 10:40 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Has anyone a better idea?


[07/18/2022 11:01 PM] Satergo#0000
I guess this is the only way. If I show [headers] as a note and also hide the number for headers then the impression of restart would probably be prevented


[07/18/2022 11:04 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Another idea would be to split the progress bar. First section headers, second section blocks

 Can you make the progress bar turn when it syncs, like an old barbershop sign, and change its length according to the syncing progress

So since 0.0.4 is not a good next version, what should it be? 1.0.0 might sound like it's the first release. Maybe 1.4.0 or 1.0.4 or uhm 4.0.0?


[07/19/2022 5:55 PM] Gstoiti#0000
1.4.0 would be my choice


[07/19/2022 6:13 PM] Satergo#0000
the first component could be dropped so 4.0 is also an option


[07/19/2022 6:17 PM] Gstoiti#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *the first component could be dropped so 4.0 is also an option*) 
 
 If you want to do that I would call it 2.1. Imo there was one big update from 1.x to 2.0 and the next smaller update would be 2.1.


[07/19/2022 6:33 PM] Satergo#0000

 Yeah same


[07/20/2022 11:37 AM] Satergo#0000
This way I can release bug fixes often and just increase 0.0.x


[07/20/2022 11:37 AM] Satergo#0000
The first component would increase either when the 2nd would hit 10 or when a big update is made


[07/20/2022 11:38 AM] Satergo#0000
I can always change this afterwards since update checking just uses a simple number that I increase every release (versionCode)

have you considered adding satergo to the dapp connector react package? currently has nautilus and safew

(re @TheRealErgoGod : *have you considered adding satergo to the dapp connector react package? currently has nautilus and safew*) 
 
 satergo is a desktop wallet sir


[07/20/2022 5:43 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
oh for some reason i thought it had both options sir


[07/20/2022 5:44 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @TheRealErgoGod : *oh for some reason i thought it had both options sir*) 
 
 no sir , runs locally on your machine . full node wallet


[07/20/2022 5:44 PM] Satergo#0000
you can also use it with remote node though


[07/20/2022 5:45 PM] Satergo#0000
But no dApp connector yet. I was going to make a browser ext that connects to the wallet but google store needs credit card to upload extensions lol

 would be nice 👍🏽


[07/20/2022 6:02 PM] Satergo#0000
I noticed many wallets have a balance card so I made this. Should it be added to the wallet? It will have rounded edges.

(re @Armeanio : *Any chance to see a solo mining feature on top of the node?*) 
 
 No idea how complicated or simple that is, but thanks for the idea. Will add it to the roadmap and check later


[07/20/2022 7:57 PM] Satergo#0000
There is a risk that antiviruses would block the wallet thinking that the miner is a virus though


[07/20/2022 7:57 PM] Satergo#0000
If I make it it will be a plugin, not inside the core

Yes, very professional. The exact opposite of my skills lol


[07/22/2022 3:19 PM] t_nadii#0000
Ahaha, thanks

As I understand it, now you need a design for the PC?


[07/22/2022 3:21 PM] Satergo#0000
Yes, Satergo is a desktop-only wallet


[07/22/2022 3:22 PM] t_nadii#0000
What would you like to see in the design?


[07/22/2022 3:22 PM] t_nadii#0000
I can take your existing site as a basis


[07/22/2022 3:23 PM] Satergo#0000

@t_nadii you should download the wallet, run it locally and check all the "pages it has. in my opinion icons , buttons and background look like shit ❤️

This is just a sketch! I made my version of the location of the information. I also have an idea to work on icons and make them in 3D effect. In addition, slightly change the location of information for each section. I can make a detailed script and we can discuss it 😉


[07/23/2022 5:06 PM] Satergo#0000
It looks very good just one note that since a wallet usually has many addresses there can't be one shown under the wallet name.

The sidebar look and feel is very nice but I think the content is a little too metallic


[07/23/2022 5:16 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I think it looks incredible


[07/23/2022 5:17 PM] Satergo#0000
It does 👍


[07/23/2022 5:17 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I think it needs a box for tokens like you have for the ergo amount


[07/23/2022 5:17 PM] NoahErgo#0000

 I thought that you can specify the address of the main wallet, and all additional ones will be located in the "account" tab.  But we must discuss every aspect of the program in order to make it as pleasant as possible to use 💫

(re @t_nadii : *I thought that you can specify the address of the main wallet, and all additional ones will be located in the "account" tab.  But we must discuss every aspect of the program in order to make it as pleasant as possible to use 💫*) 
 
 All addresses are of equal importance so there is no main address


[07/23/2022 5:26 PM] t_nadii#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *I think it needs a box for tokens like you have for the ergo amount*)

 Ok! I will bring them to the main page
What do you need in the navigation bar on the left?


[07/23/2022 5:34 PM] Satergo#0000
In full node mode there is a progress bar that shows sync progress, i think it could be put there.


[07/23/2022 5:54 PM] koutelier#0000
This looks really great


[07/23/2022 5:55 PM] koutelier#0000

[07/23/2022 6:08 PM] NoahErgo#0000
As part of design change i propose a name change to just Saturn Wallet 🪐 so it doesnt have ergo in name anymore lol


[07/23/2022 6:30 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *All addresses are of equal importance so there is no main address*) 
 
 You could use the ErgoDex model of selecting an active address.


[07/23/2022 6:36 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *You could use the ErgoDex model of selecting an active address.*) 
 
 Not sure what an active address is, it sends from whatever address has funds and change address can be chosen. It is one wallet after all


[07/23/2022 6:47 PM] koutelier#0000
Wen ledger sir ?


[07/23/2022 6:47 PM] koutelier#0000
Could be a great opportunity to add ledger in the design?

(re @mewtoshi : *Not sure what an active address is, it sends from whatever address has funds and change address can be chosen. It is one wallet after all*) 
 
 Well, I suppose you could think of active address as a synonym for change address.


[07/23/2022 6:54 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Because from a wallet users perspective, the most important thing is knowing where the transaction ends.


[07/23/2022 7:00 PM] NoahErgo#0000
@mewtoshi have you talked to fanta and about his ergo sphere project?


[07/23/2022 7:00 PM] NoahErgo#0000

I made a drop-down list for addresses, for quick actions with them. All other actions on addresses (delete, change, etc.) can be done in the "account" tab. How do you like this option? I also added a section for tokens and nodes

 Yes, to quickly do this without switching to other tabs. Also in this way we save space and make everything more compact

[07/23/2022 9:23 PM] Satergo#0000
About the tokens display I think it doesn't fit in the main page because most people have more than 1 token. For example with this layout people cannot see their tokens if they have 10


[07/23/2022 9:25 PM] t_nadii#0000
Dropdown list works for tokens too

Maybe consider a way to view NFTs as wel


[07/23/2022 9:27 PM] Satergo#0000
I think drop down is cool but it would need people to constantly open it to check for their tokens. in the current layout it is a separate tab but not opened from the normal tab buttons
It also needs space for the icon 36x36 and a copy ID button


[07/23/2022 9:34 PM] t_nadii#0000
how do you like this option?
This page (dashboard) is more likely to get quick information and perform quick actions, all tokens, addresses will be located in the "account" tab

I'm not sure there is space for tokens in the account tab because it has  mnemonic phrase & password, wallet password, wallet name, total balance, all addresses

(re @ldgaetano : **) 
 
 welcome


[07/23/2022 9:54 PM] ldgaetano#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *welcome*) 
 
 hello


[07/23/2022 9:55 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @t_nadii : *We can make a separate tab for tokens and nft*) 
 
 Yes, like it is right now :) By the way, is the top bar that says hello sir shown in all tabs?


[07/23/2022 9:57 PM] ldgaetano#0000
cool ui. just downloaded satergo, curious to learn more about it


[07/23/2022 9:58 PM] t_nadii#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *Yes, like it is right now :) By the way, is the top bar that says hello sir shown in all tabs?*) 
 
 Instead of sir there will be a username 😉


[07/23/2022 10:11 PM] ldgaetano#0000
does it show blockheight somewhere?


[07/23/2022 10:14 PM] ldgaetano#0000
setup was super easy though, really cool!


[07/23/2022 10:14 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @ldgaetano : *does it show blockheight somewhere?*) 
 
 It does, right next to the settings button


[07/23/2022 10:14 PM] Satergo#0000
Bottom


[07/23/2022 10:14 PM] ldgaetano#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *Bottom*) 
 
 ah after it finishes syncing?


[07/23/2022 10:14 PM] Satergo#0000
Does it say syncing headers for you?


[07/23/2022 10:15 PM] ldgaetano#0000
yeah and shows percentage


[07/23/2022 10:15 PM] Satergo#0000
After headers hit 100% blocks start syncing


[07/23/2022 10:15 PM] Satergo#0000
Then it shows because right now blocks are height 0


[07/23/2022 10:15 PM] ldgaetano#0000
okok


[07/23/2022 11:54 PM] t_nadii#0000
In general, if you like what I do, I can start developing the entire layout of the program


[07/23/2022 11:55 PM] NoahErgo#0000
@t_nadii im curious how you came to find satergo and ergo in general i dont recognize you from dev community


[07/24/2022 12:02 AM] t_nadii#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *@t_nadii im curious how you came to find satergo and ergo in general i dont recognize you from dev community*) 
 
 I'm not a developer. I offered to make a design for the ergo mobile wallet, but the developer said that now they don’t have time to change the design, after that they just invited me here to make a design for the satergo program


[07/24/2022 12:04 AM] Satergo#0000
(re @t_nadii : *In general, if you like what I do, I can start developing the entire layout of the program*) 
 
 Your work is very good if you have time and want to then your help would be very appreciated. Since half a year back people have said I should improve the UI but there was never somebody to help me and since I'm not good at design it has been left as is


[07/24/2022 12:06 AM] t_nadii#0000

 Great, now we'll do it together 😉


[07/24/2022 12:10 AM] Satergo#0000
@t_nadii Is it possible for you to give me the gradient start and end colors?


[07/24/2022 12:11 AM] t_nadii#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *@t_nadii Is it possible for you to give me the gradient start and end colors?*) 
 
 I will send you a file from Figme, do you know how to work with Figmа?


[07/24/2022 12:12 AM] Satergo#0000
No but I can probably understand it


[07/24/2022 12:12 AM] Satergo#0000
Is it free?


[07/24/2022 12:15 AM] NoahErgo#0000
it is, figma is great


[07/24/2022 12:17 AM] t_nadii#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *Is it free?*) 
 
 Yes, it's free! There you can export all icons, fonts, colors, etc. I will prepare all this tomorrow and send it to you


[07/24/2022 12:17 AM] t_nadii#0000
Ok?


[07/24/2022 12:18 AM] Satergo#0000
Ok


[07/24/2022 12:18 AM] Satergo#0000
I have registered


[07/24/2022 12:22 AM] t_nadii#0000
I want to take it slow so we can easily change the design in the future and it's easy for you to use design elements from layouts


[07/24/2022 12:25 AM] NoahErgo#0000
I am trying satergo on a pi we will see if it is able to sync


[07/24/2022 12:25 AM] Satergo#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *I am trying satergo on a pi we will see if it is able to sync*) 
 
 Make sure your OS is 64-bit

(re @mewtoshi : *Make sure your OS is 64-bit*) 
 
 @NoahErgo hehe


[07/24/2022 12:26 AM] NoahErgo#0000
It is, just reinstalled for 64 bit


[07/24/2022 12:26 AM] Satergo#0000
Great


[07/24/2022 12:26 AM] NoahErgo#0000
went through hell trying to switch it before lol


[07/24/2022 12:26 AM] NoahErgo#0000
Just started from scratch


[07/24/2022 12:26 AM] Satergo#0000
Lol rip


[07/24/2022 12:26 AM] t_nadii#0000
I love minimalism, but now a lot of people like 3D style icons, we can try to add them, what do you think? 

just like here->

I like minimal personally


[07/24/2022 12:27 AM] Satergo#0000
The only icons we have are copy, pen, trash can and settings so I think minimalism is better for this


[07/24/2022 12:28 AM] t_nadii#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *The only icons we have are copy, pen, trash can and settings so I think minimalism is better for this*) 
 
 I can make icons for each section


[07/24/2022 12:28 AM] Satergo#0000
(re @t_nadii : *I can make icons for each section*) 
 
 Really? That would be very cool


[07/24/2022 12:30 AM] t_nadii#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *Really? That would be very cool*) 
 
 We'll try it, if it looks weird we'll leave it until good times 🌝

[07/24/2022 12:33 AM] NoahErgo#0000
So initially it seems that the pi does not like satergo very much which is not surprising


[07/24/2022 12:39 AM] NoahErgo#0000
Wasnt getting peers initially but seems to be now


[07/24/2022 12:39 AM] NoahErgo#0000
Nothing changed lol


[07/24/2022 12:40 AM] Satergo#0000
The node takes a short while to report its peers


[07/24/2022 3:12 AM] ldgaetano#0000
you used javafx for the ui?


[07/24/2022 5:08 AM] ibetuwill#0000
Nadi makes some magic!
Useful wallet with a great UI!
What else can anyone ask for?


[07/24/2022 5:59 AM] NoahErgo#0000
@mewtoshi display bars seem to stay on headers rather than switching to blocks. So its stuck saying 100% but on browser node interface im at like 33% block sync


[07/24/2022 1:17 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @ldgaetano : *you used javafx for the ui?*) 
 
 Yes


[07/24/2022 1:18 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *@mewtoshi display bars seem to stay on headers rather than switching to blocks. So its stuck saying 100% but on browser node interface im at like 33% block sync*) 
 
 Ok that doesn't happen for me but since it checks if headers are 100% to display blocks I guess it's too strict. Probably network height minus 50 or 100 is better as a condition

I'm running a node from Argentina, why it's not showing on ergonodes.net? What could be the cause?


[07/24/2022 4:26 PM] Gstoiti#0000
(re @octopus_shepherd : *I'm running a node from Argentina, why it's not showing on ergonodes.net? What could be the cause?*) 
 
 did it run at the time of the last update (03:07:45 UTC)?


[07/24/2022 4:29 PM] octopus_shepherd#0000
(re @Gstoiti : *did it run at the time of the last update (03:07:45 UTC)?*) 
 
 Yes, it's running non stop since more than a month ago. I have it behind a router without opened ports, should I have to make some port public?


[07/24/2022 4:31 PM] Gstoiti#0000
(re @octopus_shepherd : *Yes, it's running non stop since more than a month ago. I have it behind a router without opened ports, should I have to make some port public?*) 
 
 Idk, but I don't think you need to do that. @mewtoshi probably knows what's the problem

(re @octopus_shepherd : *Yes, it's running non stop since more than a month ago. I have it behind a router without opened ports, should I have to make some port public?*) 
 
 He said a few days ago:
_You go in your router settings and add a TCP portforwarding entry for your computer's local IP and port 9030_


[07/24/2022 4:34 PM] ibetuwill#0000
Try this port


[07/24/2022 4:36 PM] octopus_shepherd#0000
(re @ibetuwill : *Try this port*) 
 
 Perfect! Thanks! I'll try now. How often does ergonodes.net update?


[07/24/2022 4:36 PM] Satergo#0000
How do you know it's not there?


[07/24/2022 4:36 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @octopus_shepherd : *Perfect! Thanks! I'll try now. How often does ergonodes.net update?*) 
 
 Hourly usually


[07/24/2022 4:36 PM] octopus_shepherd#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *How do you know it's not there?*) 
 
 Because I'm from Argentina, and there's none from here 😢


[07/24/2022 4:37 PM] Satergo#0000
Oh ok

Ras pi is still syncing slow and steady. I am surprise tho, in my experience ras pis have required a bit of tinkering otherwise they stop syncing altogether. Satergo may be the best option of ras pis

(re @NoahErgo : *Ras pi is still syncing slow and steady. I am surprise tho, in my experience ras pis have required a bit of tinkering otherwise they stop syncing altogether. Satergo may be the best option of ras pis*) 
 
 Did you set a satergo full-node for RasPi???


[07/24/2022 5:50 PM] ibetuwill#0000
Do you have any tutorials? I want to buy one and set a node, but do not know where to srart.
What model do you use? SSD or SD card? What OS?


[07/24/2022 5:50 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Thats what i am trying to do


[07/24/2022 5:51 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Satergo makes it easy


[07/24/2022 5:52 PM] NoahErgo#0000
i have a ras pi 4. 32 gig sd card. Ras pi imager makes installation of os easy just choose 64 bit but rather than 32

Hi @t_nadii can you share it on Figma?

Welcome


[07/24/2022 9:04 PM] Satergo#0000
@t_nadii I got an idea. In the wallet balance in dashboard, the chart could be changed to a token list? What do you think?

 check your mail again, I sent an invitation to the project (I forgot that I was working in a draft)


[07/24/2022 9:39 PM] t_nadii#0000
at the moment I just change each page to a new design, it will take time, after I add new icons, active and inactive buttons, etc.

 Great idea, this is why is stopped running a node, annoyed me having to start it again everyday and let it resync


[07/25/2022 4:53 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @Matt : *hey, maybe a very noob question but do you guys run the node as a service? or manually restart it every time you reboot?*) 
 
 Just drop it into a bat file in your start-up folder.


[07/25/2022 4:55 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Could easily set up a macro to run on startup if you want to


[07/25/2022 4:56 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000

(re @kushti_ru : *Standard config?*) 
 
 Yes standard


[07/25/2022 7:30 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Updated to newest node this morning


[07/25/2022 7:30 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Pis have had a history of getting stuck on blocks tho


[07/25/2022 7:38 PM] kushti#0000
Maybe db issue


[07/25/2022 7:38 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I think its a pi memory issue


[07/25/2022 7:38 PM] kushti#0000
On Mac OS and raspy we use different db basically


[07/25/2022 7:38 PM] NoahErgo#0000
they get bogged down


[07/25/2022 7:44 PM] Satergo#0000
@kushti_ru is there no viable cross-platform DB?


[07/25/2022 7:56 PM] kushti#0000
It also should be embedded, and efficient, then not so many options actually


[07/25/2022 7:57 PM] kushti#0000
Maybe switching to rocksdb makes sense


[07/25/2022 7:57 PM] kushti#0000
Its jni library well maintained


[07/25/2022 7:57 PM] kushti#0000
And supports 32 bit Linux systems


[07/25/2022 7:58 PM] Satergo#0000
If sql is an option then hsqldb is pure java and embedded


[07/25/2022 7:58 PM] Satergo#0000
I use it for ergonodes.net


[07/25/2022 8:01 PM] kushti#0000
Key value is enough


[07/25/2022 8:01 PM] kushti#0000
Mvcc from h2 could be a candidate


[07/25/2022 8:01 PM] kushti#0000
But some functions there were buggy when I tried


[07/25/2022 8:29 PM] NoahErgo#0000
@mewtoshi could you add an option maybe in the ui to run the node at specific ram amounts?


[07/25/2022 8:30 PM] NoahErgo#0000
For pis its best to run them with limited ram at 2gb


[07/25/2022 8:30 PM] curbsideprophetz#0000
2gb to sync then 1gb afterwards is 👌


[07/25/2022 8:32 PM] Satergo#0000

(re @NoahErgo : *@mewtoshi could you add an option maybe in the ui to run the node at specific ram amounts?*) 
 
 Should it be based on Gibibyte (GiB) or Gigabyte (GB)? I've never understood why there are two

Hey sirs! 

I made 3 sketches for the Satergo logo. These are just sketches, so I want to know your opinion. There will be more options. Since many associated the logo with Saturn, I took this form for the base

 it's really easy you just download the wallet from satergo.com and run the bat file, yeah it has a restore feature


[07/27/2022 4:04 PM] stillDreamy#0000
(re @koutelier : *it's really easy you just download the wallet from satergo.com and run the bat file, yeah it has a restore feature*)

(re @stillDreamy : *So far easy like you said. How much space would a full node take up more or less?*)

Nipopows are not saving gbs, headers are compact anyway, like 160 mb now, maybe 200


[07/27/2022 4:28 PM] kushti#0000

One more thing I'm looking for in a wallet. I want a way to control it from another program or from a command line. I know the node supports a REST API. Does this wallet offer any other way? Like maybe command line parameters? I noticed it uses a batch script to start it, maybe if I look at that it will give me some clues...

 The node has a rest api but it only gives access to the node wallet. You're not actually using satergo if you use that http api. Satergo has one command line option which is useless for you (--uri which opens a payment URI)


[07/27/2022 4:50 PM] stillDreamy#0000
I see. What do you think is the best approach for me? I'm trying to write either a program or script that can restore a wallet and then check if there is anything in it.


[07/27/2022 4:50 PM] stillDreamy#0000
Could be either with your wallet app, some other wallet, the node wallet, or just using some library and make my own wallet.

 If you are going to build something, it would be cool if you participate with it in one of the next ErgoHacks. Because people who lost (or can't read) one or two words of their seeds could use it too. Like https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ dies for Bitcoin seeds. 

Then the whole community could benefit after the treasure hunt.

It has ruined the entire Java ecosystem for me. I never want to program anything that runs on java because of it. I don't understand why it is so much more complex than all the other dependency managers I have used. I can never get anything to work with it. Compared to .net NuGet, npm, yarn, PHP's Composer, all of those I had no problems with.

 Hm weird, Gradle is really simple. Maybe it was an old version or version incompatibility but you literally add 1 line to add a library

 It was a couple years ago, I was trying the latest version. All the examples were super complex and any time I tried to add libraries I wanted, I could never get it to work. Another programmer I worked with said the same thing. But our Android developer never had any problems using it with Android apps.

 I hope so, it sucks having to choose your language based on the dependency manager you are trying to avoid

Hi guys, first time setting up Satergo and syncing the node here... I seem to have arrived at a point where it looks like its complete but I dont know if its still doing something in the background.. should I keep waiting?

Thanks for any help


[07/28/2022 3:58 AM] NoahErgo#0000
Best way to check currently is to reference the ergo node ui and see what it says


[07/28/2022 3:58 AM] NoahErgo#0000
I think the status bar is bugged still in satergo

Thanks. Iv gone to bed now and left it running. I'm assuming it's not complete, since the 'updating' pop up is still there. Will check in the morning. Thanks Noah

Seems on pi the node stops being able to sync. Even at max peers it just idles. And i can tell navigation of the pi os becomes sluggish. I think if you could implement a ram limit on node like a described before that would be the next thing id like to test


[07/28/2022 7:12 AM] NoahErgo#0000
Testing running the node via terminal with limited ram flag to see if that actually fixes it


[07/28/2022 7:19 AM] NoahErgo#0000
Hmm what does it mean when it says “applying block xxxxxx during node startup to restore consistent state” where x  is each consecutive block


[07/28/2022 1:42 PM] Satergo#0000

 I should add a progress bar to that dialog

[07/28/2022 1:46 PM] Satergo#0000
The UI also told you that tho


[07/28/2022 1:46 PM] Satergo#0000
That updating is just version update


[07/28/2022 1:47 PM] AndyLowe#0000

 it was not possible for me to close that dialogue box

[07/28/2022 2:42 PM] scotman8888#0000
It looks like the nodes don't communicate over ipv6


[07/28/2022 2:42 PM] scotman8888#0000
The next task for me is to try and get the ergo explorer to run on a pi


[07/28/2022 2:43 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @Deleted User : *It looks like the nodes don't communicate over ipv6*) 
 
 The protocol supports broadcasting IPv6 addresses, but I haven't seen any in the Ergonodes database, so I'm not sure


[07/28/2022 2:45 PM] scotman8888#0000
Yeah not exactly a high priority item but it is interesting as some countries only have ipv6 available


[07/28/2022 2:46 PM] scotman8888#0000
Back in 2012 my isp made dual stack available and I've been poking around with it ever since

[07/28/2022 3:17 PM] AndyLowe#0000
Can someone explain 'do not forget to port-forward it to become accessible for incoming connections'


[07/28/2022 3:18 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @AndyLowe : *Can someone explain 'do not forget to port-forward it to become accessible for incoming connections'*) 
 
 Port-forwarding opens up your node for incoming connections. When new nodes are started up, they can only connect to nodes that have port-forwarded.


[07/28/2022 3:19 PM] AndyLowe#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *Port-forwarding opens up your node for incoming connections. When new nodes are started up, they can only connect to nodes that have port-forwarded.*) 
 
 are there any downsides to doing this?


[07/28/2022 3:19 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @AndyLowe : *are there any downsides to doing this?*) 
 
 No, just maybe a little more bandwidth usage


[07/28/2022 3:20 PM] AndyLowe#0000
so how do I do it, I enter my IP address into the 'set public address' and thats it?


[07/28/2022 3:20 PM] Satergo#0000
That's half what you need to do


[07/28/2022 3:20 PM] AndyLowe#0000
IPv4 or IPv6 ?


[07/28/2022 3:21 PM] Satergo#0000
You need to open your router settings (usually at URL http://192.168.1.1 or http://192.168.0.1) and enable port-forwarding to your local IP and port 9030


[07/28/2022 3:21 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @AndyLowe : *IPv4 or IPv6 ?*) 
 
 Use IPv4 if you have it

The redesign might just take much less time than expected since I discovered a hot reload library for JavaFX. I don't need to restart every second to see the changes anymore, they just show up as I edit

Maybe the buttons could be more opaque/dark so that it appears more that they are in front of the saturn image and would make text easier to parse

Thats a nitpick tho :)

[08/03/2022 3:03 PM] ibetuwill#0000
But you have to open 9030 port and have a dedicated IP to let other nodes contact with yours.


[08/03/2022 3:04 PM] ibetuwill#0000

By the way there was an awesome animation & transition library released for JavaFX like a week ago so it's going to help a lot as well 👌

Perhaps a dumb question: If I wanted to try out Satergo and I already run a node, can you run two instances and/or are there any problems in doing so?


[08/03/2022 6:28 PM] Satergo#0000
If it's on the same computer you need to use different ports


[08/03/2022 6:31 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *If it's on the same computer you need to use different ports*) 
 
 Probably easiest just to kill it then.


[08/03/2022 6:31 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *Probably easiest just to kill it then.*) 
 
 You can open an existing node in Satergo, you don't have to download it again

Oh, ok, that's even better.


[08/03/2022 6:32 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
It's easy to change the port too


[08/03/2022 6:32 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *Oh, ok, that's even better.*) 
 
 You just shut down the node and select the directory in Satergo. Then it runs from Satergo


[08/03/2022 6:32 PM] marty_ergopad#0000

oh OK, I must admit I'm no dev by any stretch so have no idea

I believe you changed log level to INFO

So if you could change that to ERROR, you won't get any of this


[08/03/2022 8:18 PM] Joe#0000
it's on WARN

Hello, just a question, the Satergo wallet always gives a 15 word seed phrase? never a 24 words seed?

(re @DrTwentyOne : *Hello, just a question, the Satergo wallet always gives a 15 word seed phrase? never a 24 words seed?*) 
 
 You could always create a 24 word seed in another application, like the Ergo paper wallet, and restore it in your wallet of choice.

 When are we exposed to potential hacks? Is it when we first invoke the production of 24 words (and this is why you suggest doing it offline); or when you restore a wallet online? Or when our wallet in open in our PC?

Even when I do $ npm install -g @vue/cli it still borks.


[08/06/2022 6:55 AM] cafebedouin#0000
there's some undocumented dependencies that the build isn't putting together. So, then you have to figure out what's missing vue/cli is part of it.

 The comment is for the paranoid. If you don't like the idea of generating a wallet from a website, and you shouldn't, it is basically saying download the file to your machine and run it there.

That's as easy as downloading the html file and then opening it with a browser.

It has everything to do with DrTwentyOne wanting a wallet with a 24 word seed.

 I get it; but theoretically - do you know when one’s wallet is more available to hacks?


[08/06/2022 7:00 AM] odiseus_me#0000

[08/06/2022 7:02 AM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *I get it; but theoretically - do you know when one’s wallet is more available to hacks?*) 
 
 It's a weird question. There are a lot of attack vectors. Someone could install a keylogger in your OS. You could have wrote your seed in a notebook and a relative finds it. If this week is any indication if you use a closed source wallet and the developer, against even the most basic security practice, choses not to encrypt your seed with your password for some inexplicable reason.


[08/06/2022 7:04 AM] cafebedouin#0000
If your concern is security, the safest option on Ergo is the Ergo Mobile Wallet with one hot and read only, and another device that signs transactions. If you need to use Ergodex, then it gets more complicated.


[08/06/2022 7:05 AM] cafebedouin#0000
if you want a 24 word seed, use the paper wallet and import it into the Ergo Mobile Wallet. You just have to trust anon_br. The code just looks like it is randomly picking words from a list, but I'm not an expert in wallet generation.


[08/06/2022 7:19 AM] odiseus_me#0000

 Yes, I know all this; my question was not clear enough. I am just wondering - if you have your seed written offline only - what attack vectors could be used against you.


[08/06/2022 7:22 AM] odiseus_me#0000
Another question - can I create a wallet from scratch - totally offline? Like choose 24 words from a printed list, convert them to a wallet and generate a ‘receipt’ address (what do I use for that?), and send funds to that address.

 Am I describing a sim-less wifi-less phone? (Which could display a scannable QR code). The only part missing, I guess, is that this wallet I made needs to be registered with the blockchain, not so?


[08/06/2022 7:32 AM] cafebedouin#0000
Written seeds are subject to physical attacks, such as burglary. One way of thinking about seeds is that they are keys. The blockchain holds boxes with values in them. In order for a key to have any value, it needs to match with a box that has value on the chain. I believe you could choose the words, but people don't tend to choose randomly, so it may be less secure (easier to guess). Whether that's easy enough to actually guess depends on the particular seed you choose.


[08/06/2022 7:33 AM] cafebedouin#0000
The sim-less wifi less phone is the cold wallet talked about for the Ergo Mobile Wallet. See this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maau3TDC19k

[08/06/2022 7:52 AM] DrTwentyOne#0000
@cafebedouin ok thank you very much for the effort anyway!  But, the thing is, if we just have the complete list of words, couldn't we just load that offline and choose randomly? (using a RNG). Then I get to generate my addresses offline. I just need to verify that the addresses generated correspond to the private keys generated in the wallet I entered the 24 seeds words into offline (in this case, I need no trust, and I don't have to build the wallet from github). Get the point? I'll leave this question to you for the next break:).


[08/06/2022 7:52 AM] DrTwentyOne#0000

 Yes, you can do that, but you shouldn't choose the words yourself. As Cafebedouin already said, people tend to choose words which build sentences  or are connected to their life, which makes it easier to guess them. But you could e.g. use a random process (coins, dice,...) to choose words offline randomly (but one has to make sure that each word has about the same probability, if you need help you can dm me).

Then the attack vulnerabilites are physical theft (as Cafebedouin said) and at the time when you put the seed into your wallet software. If you only need an address to receive, you should also be able to calculate the address from your seed words without a computer following the algorithm for address generation, but I guess it needs a lot effort.

 So theoretically, I can produce an address using Pi that would never connect to the internet. If the address is produced correctly - once I send funds to it (from an online wallet) the blockchain would record it. So apart from physical theft of the 24 words - the wallet would be 100% safe… correct?


[08/06/2022 1:23 PM] Satergo#0000
How about you generate it with a paper, pen, and calculator


[08/06/2022 1:23 PM] Satergo#0000
And I don't see the need for 24 words. Just use a mnemonic password (which only Satergo and the node supports)

 Yes, exactly.

(re @mewtoshi : *How about you generate it with a paper, pen, and calculator*) 
 
 Yeah, that's what I had in my mind. Probably a bit cumbersome to derive the address from the seed words by hand.

 1 mistake and it's all sent into the void


[08/06/2022 1:29 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Btw the biggest risk is probably not theft, but that you loose your seed words.


[08/06/2022 1:29 PM] Satergo#0000
Yeah


[08/06/2022 1:30 PM] Satergo#0000
Making things way too secure isn't good either. What if you die? Nobody can get access


[08/06/2022 1:30 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Imo only people who really know what they are doing should try generating the words and address by themselves. Everyone else is probably a lot better off trusting Satergo


[08/06/2022 1:30 PM] Satergo#0000
You can copy the relevant code for address derivation if you really want 0 trust


[08/06/2022 1:34 PM] Satergo#0000
I can add longer mnemonic phrases if it is requested but you can be sure that it will be hidden behind some right click where you wouldn't expect it, because it would just confuse

(re @odiseus_me : *Yes, I know all this; my question was not clear enough. I am just wondering - if you have your seed written offline only - what attack vectors could be used against you.*) 
 
 The attack vectors in this case would be the physical theft. But if you encrypt that seed phrase and know the password of encryption, then there would be no longer attack vectors for you, except in cases where you can be forced by someone to reveal the place of your paper wallet and give him the password for decrypting.

One can do the same with any other wallet. One wallet with small funds if one is forced to reveal a seed/password/whatever and one wallet with the main funds. I just linked the ledger article, because I think those are good for people thinking about such details.


[08/06/2022 3:15 PM] Satergo#0000
You can use the same phrase and in the passwordless one have some trash and an actual one with a mnemonic password

 Your kid's friend Timmy heard you were big into crypto, got into something early. Timmy tells his meth dealer. Meth dealer comes with his enforcers and starts breaking your fingers until you give him your seed phrase.

Security always comes down to your threat model, and where it breaks down is the threat you didn't see. Oops! You got a UTI and dropped into dementia and now do not know how to decrypt your passphrase.

 Yeah of course if you'll have dementia or for some reason lose your memory then you'll have a whole lot of problems other than losing access to crypto.

I only mention it because 40% of Americans over 80 have some form of dementia and had a relative go from fully functioning to delusions after a UTI.

Also even if your family has access to your seed (in case of death or dementia), do they know how to use it? They must know on which blockchains your assets are, which wallet software they can trust, whether your assets are in some smart contracts/staking, what's the value of your nfts....

If they ask for help, they might get scammed.

With a sliding scale that starts at 25%, and goes to 5%. I'd say if you are holding, you probably should stake.

I just had a thought whether seed phrase or mnemonic phrase is better terminology


[08/07/2022 12:15 AM] Satergo#0000
En.bitcoin.it wiki did not disappoint


[08/07/2022 12:15 AM] Satergo#0000
Alternative name "mnemonic phrase"

Seed phrases are sometimes called mnemonic phrases, especially in older literature. This is a bad name because the word "mnemonic" implies that the phrase should be memorized. It is less misleading to call them seed phrases.


[08/07/2022 12:16 AM] Satergo#0000
I will have to figure out what to call the mnemonic password though


[08/07/2022 12:50 AM] Satergo#0000

[08/07/2022 12:59 AM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *I will have to figure out what to call the mnemonic password though*) 
 
 Either stick with the standard phrasing or try something more descriptive - e.g., seed salt, personal seed, that is defined on the page it is created. Should be clearly differentiated from spending/wallet password.

 Happens all the time. They probably had a version that worked fine. It is now a year later and they have a bunch of depreciated dependencies. If you aren't actively developing or maintaining something, this is what happens.

 ok, I thought a code program should even work after 50 years no matter what. Maybe true if there were no dependencies and just a code on a programming language.

 Actually, in Java it is standard to use exact versions of libraries so even 50 years from now you can compile Satergo as it is today

I imagine there will be more bugs that come with a public test so the sooner the better imo


[08/11/2022 2:59 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *I imagine there will be more bugs that come with a public test so the sooner the better imo*) 
 
 These bugs I found are from 1.5 and 0.5 months back so I kind of prioritize them above new design right now

what does the Set Public Address feature do? and how do i setup port forwarding so my node shows up on the ergonode website?


[08/11/2022 10:25 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @ldgaetano : *what does the Set Public Address feature do? and how do i setup port forwarding so my node shows up on the ergonode website?*) 
 
 Set public address makes it known in the network that your node is open for incoming connections and the IP address to connect to your node


[08/11/2022 10:25 PM] Satergo#0000
Port-forwarding is different from router to router, but every router has this feature. Search around and you will find it. I can help if needed


[08/11/2022 10:26 PM] ldgaetano#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *Port-forwarding is different from router to router, but every router has this feature. Search around and you will find it. I can help if needed*) 
 
 my isp has an app to do it so it's super easy to setup, but now idk what to do in satergo app


[08/11/2022 10:26 PM] Satergo#0000
You just need to set public address and then restart your node


[08/11/2022 10:27 PM] ldgaetano#0000
so should the port be the default 9030 or the one used for port forwarding?


[08/11/2022 10:27 PM] Satergo#0000
Yes


[08/11/2022 10:28 PM] Satergo#0000
9030


[08/11/2022 10:28 PM] Satergo#0000
You should use that for port forwarding


[08/11/2022 10:28 PM] Satergo#0000
But if you don't, write the one you used in port forwarding


[08/11/2022 10:28 PM] Satergo#0000
Do note that the WAN port can differ but if you change the LAN port, you must edit the configuration


[08/11/2022 10:32 PM] ldgaetano#0000
i used 9030 for port forwarding


[08/11/2022 10:32 PM] Satergo#0000
Great that's the simplest way


[08/11/2022 10:32 PM] ldgaetano#0000
i tried restarting but i got an error


[08/11/2022 10:32 PM] ldgaetano#0000
also got an error when i changed the api key and restarted the node


[08/11/2022 10:32 PM] ldgaetano#0000
is localhost:9030 also accessible because it wasnt for me?


[08/11/2022 10:33 PM] Satergo#0000
It is but not from a web browser because it is a pure TCP connection

Satergo doesn't use your system's java for running itself nor the node

So… node is syncing wallet working; I have two questions:
1. Can’t I run two nodes at the same time on the same home network? Once this node started the other node I am running stopped with an error and wouldn’t restart. 
2. Is the node that Satergo sets up different from the node I am building from scratch? One reason I am asking this is to understand why I still can’t see my country listed on ergonodes…

 Did the website update since you started to run the node? Is one of your neighbour countries listed?


[08/12/2022 3:20 PM] Satergo#0000
And did you set the declaredAddress correctly and port forward


[08/12/2022 3:21 PM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @Gstoiti : *Did the website update since you started to run the node? Is one of your neighbour countries listed?*) 
 
 Website does not show any other country in my neighborhood 
I opened the ergonodes website when the node was over 50% synced


[08/12/2022 3:21 PM] Satergo#0000
If your node is not port forwarded there is a small chance that it won't get found


[08/12/2022 3:22 PM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *And did you set the declaredAddress correctly and port forward*) 
 
 Not sure about this
My home modem can’t be accessed by me - only by the cable provider 
I guess it’s a good time to switch now…


[08/12/2022 3:23 PM] odiseus_me#0000
So two more questions:
1. As ask before - can’t I run two nodes at the same time?


[08/12/2022 3:23 PM] Satergo#0000
You can


[08/12/2022 3:24 PM] odiseus_me#0000
2. To interact with Swagger - I need to set API password. How is this done with Satergo?


[08/12/2022 3:25 PM] Satergo#0000
Well you can do it from the menu but somebody reported a bug with it so it might not work


[08/12/2022 3:25 PM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *You can*) 
 
 How? Do I need to reference another port (other than 9053); not even sure I am even asking the question correctly …


[08/12/2022 3:26 PM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *Well you can do it from the menu but somebody reported a bug with it so it might not work*) 
 
 What do I choose in the menu? I don’t see API


[08/12/2022 3:59 PM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *You can*) 
 
 Right. Two nodes running now.


[08/12/2022 4:01 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *What do I choose in the menu? I don’t see API*) 
 
 There is a menu in the node tab


[08/12/2022 4:22 PM] odiseus_me#0000
I see the menu
But it does not say API - password


[08/12/2022 4:23 PM] Satergo#0000
There is no api password. There is an api key


[08/12/2022 4:23 PM] Satergo#0000
But it could be broken


[08/12/2022 4:25 PM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *There is no api password. There is an api key*) 
 
 OK. I understand - no api password. and - there is api key - how do I set it? or know it?
i do not understand - "but it could be broken" -


[08/12/2022 4:26 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *OK. I understand - no api password. and - there is api key - how do I set it? or know it?

 The option to set api key maybe doesn't work


[08/12/2022 4:28 PM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *The option to set api key maybe doesn't work*) 
 
 I see


[08/12/2022 4:28 PM] odiseus_me#0000
If I want to work with Swagger - it asks me to set api key


[08/12/2022 4:29 PM] Satergo#0000
You can do it through the conf file


[08/12/2022 4:30 PM] odiseus_me#0000
Good. Not urgent though. Let me know how - when you have time.


[08/12/2022 4:36 PM] Satergo#0000

The only thing you need to do manually is API key which is because the option in Satergo broke

Guys. I cannot send from my satergo wallet. I have no idea if it’s synced with the block chain because it only says syncing headers. Should I delete everything but the wallet .dat file and start over?

i am not sure at all but it may have been my antivirus the one wich was causing problems for me, didnt noticed instantly it was moving to quarantine javaw.exe as it does with miners.exe, once i added javaw.exe to exceptions list all works perfect and node its updated to 4.0.38.

 Interesting. The node actually includes a reference miner that is disabled by default. If the antivirus is detecting that, damn, it must be quite good.


[08/13/2022 6:18 PM] Satergo#0000
I found a bug in the updating process regarding Windows. The code was deleting the old node before it had gotten shut down, which works perfectly fine on Linux, but Windows doesn't let you edit or delete files that are currently in use or running

What’s the right way to update to 1.4.1 - on Windows?


[08/13/2022 7:25 PM] Satergo#0000
Well, you need to download it and delete the old files. Annoying, I know, which is why 1.5.0 will have a Windows installer

(re @mewtoshi : *Well, you need to download it and delete the old files. Annoying, I know, which is why 1.5.0 will have a Windows installer*)

 Hi. This problem is solved in v1.4.1, if you update your Satergo version you won't have this issue next time you update your node.

How about the wallet ? Which folder do I copy?


[08/13/2022 9:37 PM] Satergo#0000
1. yeah 2. it depends on where you saved it, when you create a wallet it asks where to save

 That option is for when you already have a node and want to use it

[08/13/2022 11:20 PM] Satergo#0000

 You can change it but if you didn't then it's called "node"


[08/13/2022 11:22 PM] Satergo#0000
should be in the bin folder of the old installation

I assumed that most people would select custom directories, so the defaults are not that good

[08/14/2022 10:41 AM] Gstoiti#0000
lol I guessed it was a typo, but that you want to select the .erg file from  Satergo to open your old wallet

 Yes, but it is dependent on an external factor. Ledger needs to verify the Ergo ledger app

You can change the port of the node

Open the conf and write

scorex.network.bindAddress = "0.0.0.0:9999"

Does the Satergo-build node update itself automatically to the new. Build (4.0.39)?


[08/16/2022 9:54 PM] Satergo#0000
No, but when it finds an update it asks you if you want to update and you just accept and it's done


[08/16/2022 10:43 PM] Satergo#0000
I added an explanation to why some people might not find their node and how to fix it

I’m having issues restoring a wallet from seed phrase. I’ve tried a few wallets and non of them show a balance, transaction history, etc.

I’m running a local node (seperate from Satergo) and Satergo seems to recognise my node perfectly.

Any ideas why I can’t restore a wallet? Stragly I have the same issue trying to restore a wallet in the ergo node wallet

 There is a bug in the Ergo node wallet. Satergo uses the same cryptography as it. Unfortunately they deviate from the standard so 1/32 wallets are not the same between node wallet, mobile wallet, Satergo VS yoroi, nautilus, etc. There has been a bug report for some time but it has not gotten fixed. Nothing I can do atm

(re @koutelier : *no i thought you have said that you can't update the node ?*) 
 
 In version 1.4.0 updating the node on Windows needed you to restart Satergo. It was fixed in v1.4.1

oh okay lol


[08/21/2022 2:14 PM] Satergo#0000
I think I fixed the bug with ergonodes.net where it would freeze sometimes.

I also added more data to the API and added the amount of nodes with country unavailable


[08/21/2022 2:14 PM] Satergo#0000
And I optimized the charts page (no idea why it was so slow, but it's fixed now.)

 Not important, but I think other country rankings like nodes per capita or nodes per gdp would be interesting.

Good ideas, I should also make the daily snapshots save the reachable and unreachable count, not just total. And I can save the daily version stats as well to see how fast new versions are adopted

Is there a video tutorial for installing a node on my raspberry pi


[08/22/2022 12:46 AM] Satergo#0000
No


[08/22/2022 6:06 AM] cometeer#0000
(re @SamuelHeins : *Is there a video tutorial for installing a node on my raspberry pi*) 
 
 dont have one yet, but i run on it linux, for raspberry pi just download aarch64 version and run the run.sh file


[08/22/2022 6:09 AM] SamuelHeins#0000
Ok, I can give it a try


[08/23/2022 5:01 AM] uli.pkm#0359
my node is not showing on ergonodes, i know because i was the only one on my country, node is runing fine


[08/23/2022 7:20 AM] odiseus_me#0000
Could it be one of the 138 “unavailable “ nodes?


[08/23/2022 7:24 AM] uli.pkm#0359
it was being showed since first time i entered to the website like 2 weeks or so ago


[08/23/2022 7:26 AM] uli.pkm#0359
has been not shown since 1-2 days


[08/23/2022 7:26 AM] odiseus_me#0000
(re  : *<uli.pkm> it was being showed since first time i entered to the website like 2 weeks or so ago*) 
 
 And is gone now? Perhaps another nearby country is shown instead…


[08/23/2022 7:28 AM] odiseus_me#0000
@mewtoshi where can I see the EPRC version on the node set up by Satergo? I think it would be nice to see it, just so that I know my node is up to date.


[08/23/2022 7:29 AM] uli.pkm#0359
im on Argentina, only closer one wich have some nodes is Brazil, maybe could be mine being counted there, i think past days there was 5 and now is 6


[08/23/2022 7:31 AM] uli.pkm#0359
anyway the node is runing fine, reported that just in case


[08/23/2022 10:32 AM] odiseus_me#0000
(re  : *<uli.pkm> im on Argentina, only closer one wich have some nodes is Brazil, maybe could be mine being counted there, i think past days there was 5 and now is 6*) 
 
 I had a similar problem, and solved it when I added the IPV6 address in the config file.


[08/23/2022 10:42 AM] odiseus_me#0000
When one refers to a node accepting incoming connections (I hope this is the correct term) - is this the same as being connected to peers?


[08/23/2022 11:02 AM] uli.pkm#0359
i know (by definition) what ipv6 is but never used it, where i need to check it, on the router setup? im not sure if i have static ip on this isp, have never checked

[08/23/2022 11:54 AM] odiseus_me#0000
so this is what I did (following Aberg's instructions):
in the config - 

ergo {
  node {
    mining = false
  }
}

scorex {
  restApi {
    apiKeyHash = "replace_all-this-with-your-apiKeyHash"
  }
}

scorex.network.declaredAddress = "[2d0e:8fd0:1bc:ad20:58ac:8c72:9ab01:ac3d]:9030"


[08/23/2022 11:55 AM] odiseus_me#0000
and replace [2d0e:8fd0:1bc:ad20:58ac:8c72:9ab01:ac3d] with your IPv6 Address


[08/23/2022 12:17 PM] uli.pkm#0359
from where did you got/checked your ipv6 adress to copy?

[08/23/2022 2:50 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
Hey Guys, as an effort to get the word out on Ergo, Andy and I discussed a community driven effort promoted by Ergo for an 'Ergo Awareness Day'. The goal would be to get many genuine tweets on this day and hopefully start a snowball effect to bring new members onto the community. We do not want to be 'shilly', so the prompt would be something like 'What are your favorite things about Ergo? or 'What brought you to Ergo?'. 

We also want to get a pool of funds for the top 10 tweets. If you guys are willing to put some into the fund please let me know. 

It will be crucial for all projects on Ergo to participate so I ask that you guys get a tweet or a couple ready for the day. 

It will happen September 15th, a few days before the estimated ETH merge. The hashtag we will use is #DiscoverErgo (tg://search_hashtag?hashtag=DiscoverErgo) although i suggest to also add $ERG which is the classic one used. There will be more information coming as we need to make everyone in the community aware that it is coming! 

Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions 🙂  @mewtoshi

satergo creates a file when you enter your seedphrase . so each time you enter you can choose another file/wallet

The node I’m running (built by Satergo ) keeps crushing. What’s the best way to debug it? And, is such node identical to a node I build by myself?


[08/30/2022 6:48 AM] Satergo#0000
It is identical


[08/30/2022 7:24 AM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *The node I’m running (built by Satergo ) keeps crushing. What’s the best way to debug it? And, is such node identical to a node I build by myself?*) 
 
 You could run the jar file and get more detail on the errors you are getting.


[08/30/2022 7:28 AM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *You could run the jar file and get more detail on the errors you are getting.*) 
 
 Not really sure how to do that. Can I send you (someone) the debug log?


[08/30/2022 7:32 AM] cafebedouin#0000
Normally, it is something like java -jar C:\directory_path\ergo-4.0.41.jar --mainnet -c C:\directory_path\ergo.conf


[08/30/2022 7:33 AM] cafebedouin#0000
But you hve to have java installed, which I assume Satergo does.


[08/30/2022 7:33 AM] cafebedouin#0000
But, normally if the node is giving my problems I just restart it. And, if it persists, I wait for the update, since kushti tends to do one a week.


[08/30/2022 7:51 AM] Satergo#0000

@kushti_ru here is the Error log of the node I am running(4.0.41); it’s a node (built by Satergo) that keeps on crashing. If relevant - an ErgoDex backend bot is running in the background too. I am running the node now without the bot, to see if it will crash, but I am already seeing the same initial error messages.

Web development is such a pain. CSS here, CSS there, position this, that, classes to make rows grids aaaaa. In Satergo, the layout system Just Works™ and Makes Sense™


[08/30/2022 10:57 PM] Satergo#0000
Even though Satergo uses CSS, it's a custom variant of it (from the UI toolkit) and as the name of CSS suggests, Cascading Style Sheets, it is only used for design, style, color, shape, etc. Not for positioning and layout like it is in websites

What is that?


[08/30/2022 11:06 PM] dadreboi#0000
(re @Ubayyww : *What is that?*) 
 
 ssl certs are things that allow the server to let the client know that it's the actual real server you are visiting when you go to something like google.com


[08/30/2022 11:06 PM] dadreboi#0000
you generate a code on the server that the web address points to


[08/30/2022 11:06 PM] dadreboi#0000
then you give that code to the authorizing entity


[08/30/2022 11:07 PM] dadreboi#0000
which in turn gives you a cert


[08/30/2022 11:07 PM] dadreboi#0000
that says "yup, that specific server that generated that code behind that address is indeed the correct one"

 ty for the heads up, was gonna hit this this week 🙂


[08/31/2022 9:10 PM] dadreboi#0000
what is replacing that var?


[08/31/2022 9:13 PM] Satergo#0000
It's getting removed as it can't be adapted to the new daily stats snapshot which contains everything (countries, versions, unreachable, reachable). Don't know at the moment if I'll use the same name or new name or a new API endpoint


[08/31/2022 9:15 PM] dadreboi#0000
ok, so right now that var is all nodes together?


[08/31/2022 9:15 PM] Satergo#0000
yeah


[08/31/2022 9:15 PM] dadreboi#0000
gotcha, not a huge deal, i can just add up all countries if i want to reproduce that stat in my end


[08/31/2022 9:15 PM] Satergo#0000
Oh maybe you misunderstood


[08/31/2022 9:15 PM] dadreboi#0000
oh, i must have 🙂


[08/31/2022 9:16 PM] Satergo#0000
nodesPerDay is the snapshot count. So it is for every date. For example the total node count of 10th August 2022


[08/31/2022 9:16 PM] Satergo#0000
The `unreachable`, `reachable` and `total` fields of /api/v1/stats will not be changed, nor will the countries or versions


[08/31/2022 9:21 PM] dadreboi#0000
was it just down for a brief second?


[08/31/2022 9:21 PM] Satergo#0000

 @kushti_ru Did you find out what the problem is?


[09/01/2022 4:15 PM] Satergo#0000
He said that it stopped happening when it was fully synced


[09/01/2022 4:16 PM] Satergo#0000
Seems to be a memory issue, maybe not enough was allocated


[09/01/2022 4:17 PM] Satergo#0000
But it could also be a memory leak

 Need to check logs around the crash


[09/01/2022 4:18 PM] kushti#0000
What are the flags during the launch?


[09/01/2022 4:19 PM] kushti#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *Seems to be a memory issue, maybe not enough was allocated*) 
 
 Ah during bootstrapping there are oom issues, especially if no xmx flag, looking at it rn


[09/01/2022 4:23 PM] odiseus_me#0000
So, before the node was fully synced it kept on synching and on crashing
anyhow - the first error that i was getting is this:
11:34:09.930 ERROR [ctor.default-dispatcher-4] s.c.n.NetworkController - Declared address validation failed:

perhaps you got a clue?


[09/01/2022 4:24 PM] Satergo#0000
Satergo launch flags are just network type (--mainnet) and -c and logback level. No Xmx

 This is not related to crash, this error says that you are announcing address which is not found in your networking interface


[09/01/2022 4:32 PM] Satergo#0000

How often does that list update

Also I noticed some of the ips have reachable and unreachable ports


[09/03/2022 4:02 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @scotman8888 : *Also I noticed some of the ips have reachable and unreachable ports*) 
 
 That's not wrong or broken, there is nothing that says you can't have multiple nodes under the same router and not port forward all of them


[09/03/2022 4:03 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @scotman8888 : *How often does that list update*) 
 
 Everything on the site updates every hour


[09/03/2022 4:07 PM] scotman8888#0000
For mine it has 9030 and 9053 but 9053 is unreachable. I have only one node running but I might get a second if I can get ahold of another pi


[09/03/2022 4:08 PM] scotman8888#0000
I forwarded both ports


[09/03/2022 4:08 PM] scotman8888#0000
When I look at the routing logs I've got hundreds of connections to 9030 but none to 9053


[09/03/2022 4:11 PM] scotman8888#0000
And I verified I can pass traffic through 9053 so it is interesting the site says unreachable

scorex {

Where i can add the scorex.network.nodeName parameter?

Add at the bottom like scorex.network.nodeName = "abc"

(re @Kenial : *I was wondering if someone could tell me some reasons why I would still see 0 assets in a wallet after full sync?*) 
 
 Is this a new wallet or restored from a seed and if so which wallet did you use before


[09/19/2022 6:58 PM] Kenial#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *Is this a new wallet or restored from a seed and if so which wallet did you use before*) 
 
 Restored from a seed, but I could just make a new one.

The master addresses don't match, but the seed is the same- something odd there..


[09/19/2022 7:13 PM] Kenial#0000
The wallet file must have gotten corrupted. I made a new one, with the same key, and it's working. I would get unexpected error just trying to logout of the old one. Thanks again for an amazing tool!


[09/19/2022 7:24 PM] Satergo#0000
Oh, unexpected error on logout is a known minor bug that appeared in 1.4.1. You probably entered a word wrong, it has happened to me before


[09/19/2022 7:24 PM] Satergo#0000
1.4.1*

[09/22/2022 2:22 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @PIBM57 : **) 
 
 Hi, you seem to be using an old version (looks like 1.3.0 or 1.4.0 to me). Well it's not a bug it's just that you are trying to send even though your node has not synchronized. In newer versions it properly blocks you from trying that so I'd recommend updating as well.

Basically, just wait until your node has synced or switch to a remote node.


[09/22/2022 2:24 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @kushti_ru : *@mewtoshi headers slice max size is limited to avoid dos attacks against public nodes happened like 10 months ago*) 
 
 It's an appkit update that makes sure not only headers but also blocks are present when sending. It's not an issue in itself it's just that the node has not synced yet.


[09/22/2022 2:30 PM] PIBM57#0000
👌🏽


[09/22/2022 3:02 PM] Satergo#0000
Also, oops, there's no 1.3.0. I meant to say 0.0.3 haha

[09/22/2022 4:46 PM] JOFLITO#0000
worst case scenario you could delete your wallet and restore it


[09/22/2022 4:47 PM] PIBM57#0000

 Which option?


[09/23/2022 6:06 AM] mudilo_gorohovoe95#0000
Hi guys. am I the only one who can't restore the wallet using the seed phrase? When you create the wallet it gives you 15 words, when you try to restore it it asks 12. Anyway I enter 15 words and it recovers completely different wallet, 
So now I have 2 wallets if i click "Retrieve" mnemonic phrase in both these are the same 15 words in both, but there are different master addresses and  different balances. How is that possible?


[09/23/2022 6:29 AM] mudilo_gorohovoe95#0000
I think i get it, u have to delete  space bar after the last word. It is put at the end automatically when you choose a word from the suggested ones. If not  it restores different wallet but shows the same seed phrase

bug in windows Satergo.bat file. 
If you try running it from within a folder with spaces in the folder path, it will not work.
To fix you need to enclose some in parentheses/double quotes.

This makes it work:

(re @dadreboi : *bug in windows Satergo.bat file. 
If you try running it from within a folder with spaces in the folder path, it will not work.
To fix you need to enclose some in parentheses/double quotes.

This makes it work:
for %%F in ("%filename%") do set dirname=%%~dpF*) 
 
 Thank you, I was aware of this and already fixed it in the shell script but couldn't find information for the batch script. I'll try your solution, also I suppose you mean run.bat not Satergo.bat?

(re @mewtoshi : *Thank you, I was aware of this and already fixed it in the shell script but couldn't find information for the batch script. I'll try your solution, also I suppose you mean run.bat not Satergo.bat?*) 
 
 I honestly didn’t modify that as I skipped right to the satergo.bat file instead when run.bat wouldn’t launch. Lemme try it there.


[09/29/2022 11:55 AM] Satergo#0000
I based the Satergo.bat on another script but wrote the run.bat myself. There was an issue in the run.sh file so I thought I might have done the same with run.bat.


[09/29/2022 2:52 PM] dadreboi#0000
lemme move that code to run and see what happens


[09/29/2022 2:52 PM] dadreboi#0000
will try in a bit


[09/29/2022 7:14 PM] Satergo#0000
I just had the most obvious yet quite useful idea. Auto-update option for nodes.

This way people can just leave their node running without even having to do the 1 click for updating

Great idea


[09/29/2022 10:00 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @koutelier : *Great idea*) 
 
 Yeah and it's so basic it's really shocking nobody has told me about it / i haven't thought about it.

I guess the 1-click is sufficiently better than manually doing it that people don't feel like they need better


[09/30/2022 4:16 AM] dadreboi#0000
@mewtoshi


[09/30/2022 4:17 AM] dadreboi#0000
in Satergo.bat remove:
set DIRNAME=%~dp0
if %DIRNAME% == "" set DIRNAME=.


[09/30/2022 4:18 AM] dadreboi#0000
and replace with:
for %%F in ("%filename%") do set dirname=%%~dpF


[09/30/2022 4:19 AM] dadreboi#0000
***


[09/30/2022 4:20 AM] dadreboi#0000
and in the run.bat, completely change it to:
set DIRNAME="%~dp0bin"
cd %DIRNAME%
@start Staergo.bat


[09/30/2022 4:20 AM] dadreboi#0000
***


[09/30/2022 4:20 AM] dadreboi#0000
that gets it working for me from the run.bat when you have a space in the folder path somewhere


[09/30/2022 4:21 AM] NoahErgo#0000
Is it possible for a local node like satergo to interact with something like spectrum dex with a dapp connector somehow?


[09/30/2022 4:22 AM] NoahErgo#0000
Maybe like a browser extension as a bridge somehow but you still sign tx on the local node


[09/30/2022 6:12 AM] Satergo#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *Maybe like a browser extension as a bridge somehow but you still sign tx on the local node*) 
 
 Yes this is a planned feature.


[09/30/2022 2:16 PM] AndyLowe#0000
is there a way to make satergo node auto start everytime I start my pc? or do i have to manually remember to open the program every time i shutdown and fire up windows again?


[09/30/2022 2:16 PM] dadreboi#0000
yeah, put the batch file into startup options


[09/30/2022 2:17 PM] AndyLowe#0000
where can i find the 'batch file'


[09/30/2022 2:17 PM] AndyLowe#0000
oh just the 'run'


[09/30/2022 2:18 PM] AndyLowe#0000
gotcha


[09/30/2022 2:22 PM] dadreboi#0000
careful, the batch file looks at current links


[09/30/2022 2:22 PM] dadreboi#0000
current dir


[09/30/2022 2:22 PM] dadreboi#0000
so if you copy just the run.bat you will have issues


[09/30/2022 2:22 PM] dadreboi#0000
SHOULD work with an alias/shortcut if you drop it in shell:startup


[09/30/2022 2:25 PM] AndyLowe#0000
i have a problem which is that, if i even extracted the satergo folder to a different location other than downloads, the run batch file does not work. also, if i copy the batch file to desktop as a shortcut, it does not work. the only way i can make it work is if i open the extracted folder in downloads and click on run there


[09/30/2022 2:26 PM] AndyLowe#0000
(re @dadreboi : *SHOULD work with an alias/shortcut if you drop it in shell:startup*) 
 
 not sure what shell:startup is


[09/30/2022 2:26 PM] AndyLowe#0000
has anyone successfully managed to make it autostart on windows?


[09/30/2022 2:28 PM] Satergo#0000
Hi Andy. Autostart would be useless in the current state because you would still have to log in.


[09/30/2022 2:28 PM] AndyLowe#0000
yes i noticed that. one has to enter the password in order to start running the node is that correct?


[09/30/2022 2:28 PM] Satergo#0000
Yes


[09/30/2022 2:29 PM] AndyLowe#0000
if the password prompt popped up everytime you started windows though, it would be a reminder to enter it and get the node going


[09/30/2022 2:29 PM] Satergo#0000
True


[09/30/2022 2:29 PM] AndyLowe#0000
otherwise its easy to forget to run it every time you switch on your pc


[09/30/2022 2:29 PM] AndyLowe#0000
and i dont tend to leave it on 24/7


[09/30/2022 2:30 PM] Satergo#0000
Well you can't really move the bat file by itself but I think you can create a shortcut to it and use that (right click -> create shortcut)


[09/30/2022 2:30 PM] Satergo#0000
The next version will offer an installer for Windows which will improve the integration significantly.


[09/30/2022 2:31 PM] dadreboi#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *Hi Andy. Autostart would be useless in the current state because you would still have to log in.*) 
 
 OH RIGHT! sorry, forgot about the password promt duh lol


[09/30/2022 2:31 PM] AndyLowe#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *The next version will offer an installer for Windows which will improve the integration significantly.*) 
 
 ok i will just wait ;)


[09/30/2022 2:31 PM] dadreboi#0000
@mewtoshi will the app accecpt a password fed through the bat file?


[09/30/2022 2:31 PM] Satergo#0000
I will also add a no-wallet mode (old idea of mine) for this usecase so that it automatically starts it


[09/30/2022 2:31 PM] dadreboi#0000
as a var


[09/30/2022 2:31 PM] AndyLowe#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *I will also add a no-wallet mode (old idea of mine) for this usecase so that it automatically starts it*) 
 
 that would be good


[09/30/2022 2:32 PM] AndyLowe#0000
node should sync without needing to sign in to wallet, if pos


[09/30/2022 2:32 PM] AndyLowe#0000
then autostart without needing a password


[09/30/2022 2:39 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @dadreboi : *@mewtoshi will the app accecpt a password fed through the bat file?*) 
 
 No, the only command line argument supported is something else lol


[09/30/2022 2:40 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @AndyLowe : *node should sync without needing to sign in to wallet, if pos*) 
 
 Surely possible but I would prefer a no-wallet mode so that I don't need to duplicate the node interface to 2 places


[09/30/2022 2:41 PM] AndyLowe#0000
node+wallet with password prompt that auto pops up when you start your comp would also be fine


[09/30/2022 2:43 PM] AndyLowe#0000
also, if when you close the window, it could minimise to the system tray


[09/30/2022 2:43 PM] AndyLowe#0000
rather than closing


[09/30/2022 2:45 PM] dadreboi#0000
(re @AndyLowe : *also, if when you close the window, it could minimise to the system tray*) 
 
 NO, PLEASE NEVER DO THAT


[09/30/2022 2:45 PM] dadreboi#0000
that's what the minimize button is for


[09/30/2022 2:45 PM] dadreboi#0000
closing a window should close the app


[09/30/2022 2:45 PM] dadreboi#0000
i consider programs that practice this, malware lol


[09/30/2022 2:46 PM] AndyLowe#0000
i disagree, it depends on what the program is. I have audio interface software that has to run constantly for me to use my hardware, i dont want loads of windows to be open constantly. it doesnt make a difference if the window is open or not, if you know the program and choose to run it, how can that be malware

 from the old days that was malware behaviour is what i am saying 🙂


[09/30/2022 2:47 PM] dadreboi#0000
and it sticks with me that the function of a button and it's intented use was hijacked by programs like spotify and others who dont want to ever close 🙂


[09/30/2022 2:48 PM] AndyLowe#0000
i have there now Nvidea settings, RME total mix, Nord VPN, antivirus... they are all things I know about and are happy to be running


[09/30/2022 2:48 PM] dadreboi#0000
but i hear you about having too many windows open 😉


[09/30/2022 2:48 PM] AndyLowe#0000
it would be annoying if 4 windows popped up and i had to keep them active to not close those things


[09/30/2022 2:49 PM] dadreboi#0000
good apps actually ask you


[09/30/2022 2:49 PM] dadreboi#0000
"would you like to close or minimize to system tray"


[09/30/2022 2:49 PM] AndyLowe#0000
yeah but you should be able to set and forget, so it remembers your preference for next time


[09/30/2022 2:49 PM] AndyLowe#0000
basically i just want to run the node automatically without having to actively do anything


[09/30/2022 2:50 PM] dadreboi#0000
that could just be run as a service then


[09/30/2022 2:50 PM] AndyLowe#0000
like now my antivirus and audio interface works now


[09/30/2022 2:50 PM] dadreboi#0000
and then bring up the control interface when needed


[09/30/2022 2:50 PM] AndyLowe#0000
yeah, whatever works best


[09/30/2022 2:50 PM] AndyLowe#0000
if its safe also


[09/30/2022 2:50 PM] dadreboi#0000
(re @AndyLowe : *like now my antivirus and audio interface works now*) 
 
 prob services yea


[09/30/2022 2:50 PM] AndyLowe#0000
this is where I hand it over to you guys, im not technical enough to know how it could be implemented


[09/30/2022 2:56 PM] Satergo#0000
I'm no Windows developer, I just know cross-platform development so my experience in close integration isn't good enough to create services.

I can just make it autostart and an option to start in tray and an option to move to tray when minimized.


[09/30/2022 3:00 PM] dadreboi#0000
i love the non wallet version option, great idea

 In Windows, if you have a shortcut to the *.bat file in the start folder, it starts when the computer is booted, not when you login. I keep my computer on 24/7, and sometimes after updates, I'm not logged in, but the mining software and node are both running, which I have in the start folder.

 Assuming Windows, Windows Button + R, type in "shell:startup" without quotes next to folder. A file explorer menu will launch. Go to wherever the *.bat file for Satergo is, make a shortcut, drop the shortcut in the Startup directory.

Three new charts are coming to ergonodes.net, they will be empty until enough data is collected though so it will take some time (a week or something) until it's useful.

With this change, the historical node count is reset because the new chart separates between reachable/unreachable nodes.

Ergonodes.net needs a logo, both one to show on the main page in place of the "Ergonodes" header text (so it should contain the word Ergonodes) and a favicon for the browser tab.
I'll send 5 erg as a reward if anybody submits a good one.

Yeah, there's only 168 nodes that are on .100 or above

[10/04/2022 1:40 PM] Satergo#0000
All data is available. There is nothing fake, if a node is lying about data, there's nothing to be done.


[10/04/2022 2:01 PM] scotman8888#0000
I think he means that they are ghost nodes


[10/04/2022 2:01 PM] scotman8888#0000
Like leftover previous versions


[10/04/2022 2:02 PM] scotman8888#0000
I had one in there for a while too


[10/04/2022 2:25 PM] Satergo#0000
A broken node can report wrong information, no way to know that except for only relying on reachable node stats. But to say all nodes running a version older than 4.0.100 are not real is absurd


[10/04/2022 2:29 PM] Satergo#0000
Well I can improve it I think. I got an idea, maybe it can check if only one node is reporting it then it would be low chance for it to be active. Because nodes usually don't connect to just 1 node. But I'm not sure.


[10/04/2022 2:38 PM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *You're wrong*) 
 
 How can I be wrong? If I have started a node, then named it, and it was running; I then (after a couple of days) stopped it, renamed the node, and it was running again. Finally, I renamed it, restarted it, let it run a couple of days. Now, I restarted my computer, restarted the node, renamed it. According to ergonodes there are now four nodes running - all of them from a single pc, after I have restarted it, and made sure only a single node is running.

 Perhaps I was a bit extreme in my extrapolation from my own experience; but I meant no harm; I am only worried that we are assuming there are hundreds of actives nodes, but in reality many of them are as @scotman8888 said - ghosts…

Strange it is on the 9053 port and unreachable with the old .34 version

dumb question, is having connected peers mean my node is reachable


[10/04/2022 3:04 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @cometeer : *dumb question, is having connected peers mean my node is reachable*) 
 
 Well depends on if they're outgoing or incoming

i already port foward, dont see my ip on the list


[10/04/2022 3:05 PM] Satergo#0000

 I can connect to the reachable node just fine


[10/04/2022 3:06 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @cometeer : *i already port foward, dont see my ip on the list*) 
 
 Did you set the public address?

how do i do that


[10/04/2022 3:06 PM] Satergo#0000

yes

Click the three dots and select Set public address


[10/04/2022 3:06 PM] Satergo#0000
Inside the node tab


[10/04/2022 3:09 PM] cometeer#0000
is the setting saved somewhere, i dont see any feedback after setting it, when i click it again its blank


[10/04/2022 3:10 PM] cometeer#0000

You need to restart for it to apply as well


[10/04/2022 3:27 PM] Satergo#0000
So I'll make it create another dialog asking the user that reboot is needed and a dialog button to reboot directly from there

I'll also make it create another dialog asking the user that reboot is needed and a dialog button to reboot directly from there

@scotman8888 I mean a reachable node on version 4.0.101 is reporting scotman888 as online, it is natural that it is considered online, isn't it?


[10/04/2022 3:41 PM] Satergo#0000
And 2 nodes are reporting sudha_3 online


[10/04/2022 3:41 PM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @scotman8888 : *Nir aberg is direct don't take offense*) 
 
 Direct is better than no-response and @mewtoshi responds…


[10/04/2022 3:42 PM] Satergo#0000
There's 2 sudha_3 nodes with different versions, it is apparent to the human eye that something is wrong, but the program cannot be sure


[10/04/2022 3:42 PM] Satergo#0000
This to me is looking like a bug in the Ergo node itself, that it is reporting peers it was previously connected to as online


[10/04/2022 3:43 PM] Satergo#0000
@kushti_ru Any ideas?


[10/04/2022 3:43 PM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *There's 2 sudha_3 nodes with different versions, it is apparent to the human eye that something is wrong, but the program cannot be sure*) 
 
 Exactly! I made all the sudha nodes - but just two are running ( those on 4.0.103)


[10/04/2022 3:44 PM] Satergo#0000
sudha_1909_23:53 is online or not?


[10/04/2022 3:44 PM] kushti#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *This to me is looking like a bug in the Ergo node itself, that it is reporting peers it was previously connected to as online*) 
 
 What API method?


[10/04/2022 3:44 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @kushti_ru : *What API method?*) 
 
 I'm using the P2P message GetPeers


[10/04/2022 3:45 PM] Satergo#0000
sudha_1909_23:53 is online or not? @odiseus_me


[10/04/2022 3:46 PM] kushti#0000
Ah, indeed there you can find peers seen, not just ones online now


[10/04/2022 3:46 PM] Satergo#0000
What


[10/04/2022 3:47 PM] Satergo#0000
That's weird


[10/04/2022 3:47 PM] kushti#0000
I think that is ordinary for cryptocurrency clients I have seen


[10/04/2022 3:47 PM] Satergo#0000
No


[10/04/2022 3:47 PM] Satergo#0000
Bitcoin's getpeerinfo is described like this: "Returns data about each connected network node as a json array of objects."


[10/04/2022 3:47 PM] Satergo#0000
*connected*


[10/04/2022 3:48 PM] Satergo#0000
How, are unreachable nodes even supposed to be determined with this weird behavior of GetPeer?


[10/04/2022 3:48 PM] kushti#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *Bitcoin's getpeerinfo is described like this: "Returns data about each connected network node as a json array of objects."*) 
 
 But that is api method


[10/04/2022 3:49 PM] kushti#0000
Ergo node has similar /peers/connected api method


[10/04/2022 3:49 PM] Satergo#0000
getaddr

The getaddr message sends a request to a node asking for information about known active peers to help with finding potential nodes in the network. The response to receiving this message is to transmit one or more addr messages with one or more peers from a database of known active peers. The typical presumption is that a node is likely to be active if it has been sending a message within the last three hours.


[10/04/2022 3:49 PM] Satergo#0000
This one is P2P not api


[10/04/2022 3:50 PM] Satergo#0000
It says "asking for information about known active peers"


[10/04/2022 3:50 PM] Satergo#0000
Honestly information about seen peers is useless


[10/04/2022 3:50 PM] Satergo#0000
Because when your node is discovering other nodes what use are previously seen nodes


[10/04/2022 3:51 PM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *sudha_1909_23:53 is online or not? @odiseus_me*) 
 
 Not online


[10/04/2022 3:52 PM] Satergo#0000
@kushti_ru Don't you agree?


[10/04/2022 3:52 PM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *sudha_1909_23:53 is online or not? @odiseus_me*) 
 
 Verifying


[10/04/2022 3:53 PM] kushti#0000
GETADDR returns not connected only but active recently


[10/04/2022 3:53 PM] Satergo#0000
Well 3 hours is logical


[10/04/2022 3:53 PM] Satergo#0000
Ergo seems to keep them forever


[10/04/2022 3:53 PM] kushti#0000
Need to check how Ergo is removing old nodes


[10/04/2022 3:53 PM] Satergo#0000
Ok


[10/04/2022 3:54 PM] kushti#0000
After some time a peer will be removed


[10/04/2022 3:54 PM] kushti#0000
As the node is randomly dropping connections periodically and connecting to a random peer


[10/04/2022 3:55 PM] kushti#0000
And in case of connection failure the peer will be removed


[10/04/2022 3:55 PM] kushti#0000
But it can take long time indeed


[10/04/2022 3:56 PM] kushti#0000
So maybe we need to filter peers more aggressively on getpeers


[10/04/2022 3:58 PM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *sudha_1909_23:53 is online or not? @odiseus_me*) 
 
 No it is not online


[10/04/2022 4:08 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @kushti_ru : *So maybe we need to filter peers more aggressively on getpeers*) 
 
 Yes it would be very good to do this


[10/04/2022 4:11 PM] Satergo#0000
I'll make it so at least 2 nodes need to report a node for it to be considered online. There will still be some ghosts because of the nodes reporting nodes seen a long time ago, but it will be better I believe.


[10/04/2022 4:21 PM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *I'll make it so at least 2 nodes need to report a node for it to be considered online. There will still be some ghosts because of the nodes reporting nodes seen a long time ago, but it will be better I believe.*) 
 
 an online node has 30 peers, so isn’t 2 nodes reporting on another node too few?


[10/04/2022 4:22 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *an online node has 30 peers, so isn’t 2 nodes reporting on another node too few?*) 
 
 Your offline subha_1909 has 14 nodes reporting it.


[10/04/2022 4:22 PM] Satergo#0000
I don't want to affect actual nodes which I would if I increase to something like 20


[10/04/2022 4:23 PM] cometeer#0000

 I've seen it before, I asked kushti about it but I don't think he replied. The person that reported this got their node reachable though I think

(re @mewtoshi : *I don't want to affect actual nodes which I would if I increase to something like 20*)

[10/04/2022 4:38 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *So how is 2-nodes reporting will change the situation?*) 
 
 Some old, now offline nodes will be discarded


[10/04/2022 4:44 PM] Satergo#0000
It is not possible to know for sure whether an unreachable node is offline or online right now because of the weird behavior of the protocol


[10/04/2022 4:52 PM] odiseus_me#0000
I am going to work now on making my nodes reachable; seems even more urgent…

[10/06/2022 10:47 AM] Satergo#0000
First it needs to be on a transparent background so I can see if fits for the light theme. The one I like is the top center one, but if the text could be made larger it would be better


[10/06/2022 10:47 AM] Satergo#0000

instead of fading or cutout white behind the words and the logo, why not make the strands connect into the G and then the G connect to the ERGO so ERGO will be strand looking like the art, and NODES will be solid fill

rename to something without a space


[10/11/2022 11:39 AM] Satergo#0000
Yeah, it's fixed in the next (currently unreleased) version


[10/11/2022 1:44 PM] dadreboi#0000
if it's your user profile (which it looks like) you can just dump it to root c: so you don't have to rename your user folder.

(re @dadreboi : *if it's your user profile (which it looks like) you can just dump it to root c: so you don't have to rename your user folder.*) 
 
 I believe user profile uses another form with a tilde and number when it has those letters

Don’t rename your user folder

Just drop the node folder in the c: root

 Not much to write about adding a stratum mining server module to Satergo


[10/11/2022 4:44 PM] Satergo#0000
I guess it came off as not serious


[10/11/2022 4:45 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *Not much to write about adding a stratum mining server module to Satergo*) 
 
 Yeah, not a technical group either. Might not know what a stratum mining server is...actually, I know it only as its a protocol in the configuration file for mining, but not anything beyond that.


[10/11/2022 5:31 PM] NoahErgo#0000

@t_nadii It's kind of unclear how icon buttons should be styled. Right now both normal and hover and pressed state is white, and disabled is gray.


[10/11/2022 11:02 PM] Satergo#0000
I remember you said they should be white but the normal state or hover/pressed state needs to be changed because right now their styles don't react to anything


[10/12/2022 5:57 AM] Ahmad123_321#0000

[10/12/2022 7:21 AM] Satergo#0000

 Yes, when I release it. There's a beta available though if you want to test it


[10/12/2022 7:22 AM] Satergo#0000
I mean you'll have to update so not automatic but simple

 It is not caused by me. It has been fixed in the ergo node so it will be fixed by itself when released and people update

 Any port will work


[10/16/2022 3:15 PM] scotman8888#0000
Some are blocked by isp, try 9030, 19030, 29030, 39030, 49030 don't use anything under 1024


[10/16/2022 3:15 PM] scotman8888#0000

- Fixed light theme toggle having too tall bounds
- Added back the X cross to text fields
- Added back the eye to password fields
- Redesigned wallet creation & restoration pages
- Scroll bar design
- Accounts tab is scrollable now

I was planning to release after design beta 2 but I forgot that I haven't made light theme, which should probably be included in a beta. Thoughts? Should there be a beta 3 or not?


[10/25/2022 7:21 AM] odiseus_me#0000
One more thing which I would appreciate if corrected - after pc restarts, when i restart Satergo wallet and I input the password for the wallet - I habitually hit Enter,  but that just closes everything related to Satergo and I have to start from the beginning. Not sure it affects everyone - I am on Linux.

 A few points I noticed:
- wallet settings (change name, change password, show seed) are displayed very wide in full screen mode, although the words are very short

- Change wallet name is still old UI

- using the moon as a button for the light theme is cool, but especially in full screen mode easy to overlook

Not related to UI: 
- I would prefer to see a link to @t_nadii 's website (if she has one) instead of her email address.

- seems my German translation is missing some phrases


[10/30/2022 4:18 PM] Gstoiti#0000
But overall the wallet looks really fantastic

What do you think about the icon buttons like for example the copy address icon button?


[10/30/2022 5:21 PM] Satergo#0000
There's no hover/pressed style change but I'm not sure what they would look like

Just noticed:
- password check when restarting Satergo is old UI
- rename address is old UI
- the "+" sign to add addresses is imo very hard to find. I would prefer an "Add address" button or at least borders around the plus sign
- although the borderline color gradients look cool, on some windows, e.g., add address, I don't like that the dark corner borderline is hard to see on dark background. But I guess that's just a matter of taste


[10/30/2022 5:45 PM] Gstoiti#0000
(re @t_nadii : *@mewtoshi I added button states a long time ago :)*) 
 
 That's great!

What I also like is a small confirmation message popping up after using the button. Something like "copied address"

About "password check when restarting Satergo is old UI", I don't know if the new UI will look nice there because the main window is not started yet when that dialog is shown. It might look too different from the system because it's black and opaque and rounded

I suggested to @mewtoshi to change the background for the satergo, because the blur effect around the planets doesn't make the picture look smooth. Here is such an option as a replacement I proposed, I want to know the opinion of the community

Would it be acceptable to skip windows installer for this release?

can we just replace guts?


[11/05/2022 12:55 AM] Satergo#0000
Replace old with new? yes


[11/05/2022 12:57 AM] Satergo#0000
With installer there's just a lot of things I need to do to make it right. There needs to be new update data to point to the new installer, installing update in the background from a different process because windows is picky, reopening after the installation, making sure the update installs to the same place, choosing a place to store user settings separate from the installation because admin privilegies are needed to edit installation files, doing all the windows registry things correct to support double-clicking .erg files, to support ergo: URI, to support ergopay: URI.

It's just, a lot


[11/05/2022 12:58 AM] Satergo#0000
I'll work on it and see if it becomes too much


[11/05/2022 12:59 AM] Satergo#0000
The part I want to avoid the most is to work on the build script to run all the commands and move around things, especially since the build script does not even work on windows at the moment and to generate a windows installer it needs to be run on windows

 Ok the error happens because the node is not synced. Why it is not synced, I don't know. @kushti_ru? If you can't get the node to work, log out and change the blockchain source to remote node instead

 This is a bug that is fixed in the next version but the update is not out yet. If you try to send again it will let you remove more.

To run the node, does it mean the computer needs to be on 24/7 ?

(re @Monsters, Erg. : *To run the node, does it mean the computer needs to be on 24/7 ?*) 
 
 no, it will update itsself when you connect it again, but it might cause a delay in your TX until it is updated, @mewtoshi would be able to answer that tho!

[11/11/2022 7:09 PM] Gstoiti#0000
(re @Monsters, Erg. : *To run the node, does it mean the computer needs to be on 24/7 ?*) 
 
 Yeah, the node only runs if your computer and Satergo runs.  But you can just open Satergo after restarting your computer or put it in autostart.


[11/11/2022 7:11 PM] Gstoiti#0000
So it is not necessary to run your computer and node 24/7, but it would be cool if you start Satergo when you start your computer.


[11/11/2022 7:11 PM] Monsters, Erg.#0000

Does it use a lot of ressources like Daedalus? Can I be working with CPU and GPU while running the node?

 As far as I know you just install satergo as usual program for Linux, that's it. It took him a few days to sync the node

(re @Monsters, Erg. : *Ok, thanks 🙏

 I am not a heavy user, but my highly unqualified impression is that it needs less ressources than Daedalus.

Can somebody reply https://www.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/comments/yuzoo1/satergo_fully_synced_and_showing_a_zero_balance/?utm_source=ifttt

That because of a bug in the ergo wallet cryptography library some wallets derive differently in Satergo and the mobile wallet compared to the web browser wallets. The "solution" is to create a new wallet and send it over from the previous wallet program. The new wallet will probably not be on of the "bugged" ones.

 Can't be. Only effects JVM, and they tried it in Ergo Mobile, which should derive same address, even if its the bug.

Also, it was working in Nautilus.

The mobile wallet could have been updated to mitigate the bug.

 The bug has been known for more than half a year but the fix was merged to the library only a month ago. Satergo has not been updated to handle it yet.

 Where are you trying to send, gate io kukoin working perfectly fine..

On Kukoin

[11/24/2022 10:00 AM] ergotize#0000
(re @Ivan : *On Kukoin*) 
 
 Kukoin takes 60 confirmations where as gateio takes only 20.. try gate.. it takes an hour on gate, on kucoin it takes 3 hours almost..


[11/24/2022 10:01 AM] ergotize#0000
If you have send, you would have got the transaction link, if not just paste your address on ergo explorer, check the transaction..


[11/24/2022 10:02 AM] ergotize#0000
It takes minimum 1 confirmation to get on chain.. sometimes takes more than 10 minutes.. it's an issue with block timings..

 Install nautilus wallet in chrome extension you'll find in Google extensions.. restore your seed phrase in nautilus your wallet will migrate there and you can send from nautilus extension..


[11/24/2022 10:08 AM] Gstoiti#0000
No, it shouldn't be broken. But I am not at my laptop to help you/check what might be the problem. Maybe @mewtoshi is available. 

If you need to send your funds now, do what Ergotize recommends.

 I think also steel wheels wallet will avoid this if you point to your own node, so far true for me


[11/26/2022 3:23 PM] scotman8888#0000
I don't think nautilus let's you specify, and then there is still the explorer


[11/27/2022 9:30 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
you have to point to your own node and own explorer to really avoid being logged by another one. regarding the problem with dapp connector, when only using ergopay you have more control over what address information is sent to the dapp: you have to choose the address sent to the dapp. but of course, the usual tactics to identify users apply. even more with mosaik apps, because mosaik needs to send some information to the dapp for convenience reasons, but they make you identifyable: device type, device language, mosaik and wallet version used. that's why how obol flip was or is doing it was the best way to do to be anonymous: they provide a downloadable client serving the mosaik app on your own system. but, you see it: you need to set up your own servers to do so, and that's not everyone's cup of tea.


[11/27/2022 9:31 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
browser extensions can make you identifyable per se, so no one interested in not getting logged should use it.


[11/27/2022 9:32 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
there's always the tradeoff privacy - convenience.

 Yes, Satergo uses your node but that does not protect you from protocol-level spying. Motivated people can modify their nodes to find your IP address when you make transactions. They cannot know for sure that it is you who sent it but if they run enough nodes they can figure out that the transaction originated from your node, and with enough data they can figure out that that node only ever sent transactions from related wallets. Monero uses Dandelion++ and I think Bitcoin uses Dandelion to mitigate this. I don't think Ergo has something like that. Running your own node is still better than just using that one node that almost everybody is using because when you use that public one, it can with 100% certainty know the origin of the transaction.

The most private way at the moment is to use your own node + VPN.

 Use VPN by default. Been running my own node, but think it's time to try Satergo. I can just move those files to a directory, or do I need to sync again within wallet?

(re @Gabriel : *Pavel, this is the kind of detail I did not look at yet. What documentation can you recommend?*) 
 
 Aberg has made a website http://ergonodes.net/ and there is a short note about 9030 port.
My IP is blocking port forwarding, so I can't open a port for the node.
Or my brain is too smooth to do it correctly


[11/28/2022 8:27 PM] cometeer#0000
set the node port to a higher number like 29030, restart node, and set the same number in the router's port forward settings too

Hello guys been a minute anything new with satergo recently?


[11/29/2022 7:21 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *So I'm hoping somebody has tried the design beta 2 now. Any changes that you request? It would be nice to have a discussion now*) 
 
 just replying to this so I can click to go up


[11/29/2022 7:42 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @Gstoiti : *A few points I noticed:
- wallet settings (change name, change password, show seed) are displayed very wide in full screen mode, although the words are very short

- Change wallet name is still old UI

- using the moon as a button for the light theme is cool, but especially in full screen mode easy to overlook

Not related to UI: 
- I would prefer to see a link to @t_nadii 's website (if she has one) instead of her email address.

- seems my German translation is missing some phrases*) 
 
 - using the moon as a button for the light theme is cool, but especially in full screen mode easy to overlook

What should I do instead?

(re @mewtoshi : *- using the moon as a button for the light theme is cool, but especially in full screen mode easy to overlook

 Good question. As said above, I like the idea. Not near Satergo to take a look, but maybe you could additionally add a switch between modes to the settings menu. Fancy option (moon) + normal option.


[11/29/2022 7:54 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @Gstoiti : *Good question. As said above, I like the idea. Not near Satergo to take a look, but maybe you could additionally add a switch between modes to the settings menu. Fancy option (moon) + normal option.*) 
 
 Ok I'll keep in mind for next release, I'll just leave it as is for now


[11/29/2022 7:56 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Maybe someone else can share his opinion after the next release. If I am the only person who mentions it, then leave it as is.

@t_nadii The pressed icon color is not very good, it looks exactly like the disabled state (in here, the 3rd icon is disabled). What should be done?

(re @cometeer : *set the node port to a higher number like 29030, restart node, and set the same number in the router's port forward settings too*) 
 
 So my VPN service has a port forwarding option, and assigned me port 55718. Does that work (instead of setting on my router)? If it does, where can I assign that port on the node?


[12/01/2022 6:34 PM] cometeer#0000
i tried, doesn't work for me. you can do it and wait 2 hours and check the node list to see if it is reachable.


[12/01/2022 10:50 PM] Gabriel#0000
I will tinker around. Thanks!


[12/02/2022 12:08 AM] Gabriel#0000
Do I set the port in the ergo.config file? I don't see any info about it in ErgoDocs


[12/02/2022 12:09 AM] Gabriel#0000
I put "network.bindAddress =..." in there but clueless about it


[12/02/2022 12:12 AM] cometeer#0000
in the app itself, if you go to Node -> [...] button - > set public address


[12/02/2022 12:13 AM] cometeer#0000
it get saved to the ergo.conf file as         declaredAddress="


[12/02/2022 12:20 AM] Gabriel#0000

if i swith it off, does it open back up when i turn the computer back on?

Automatic node update added? O_O


[12/07/2022 9:31 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @question86 : *Automatic node update added? O_O*) 
 
 Next update (which is scheduled for max a week from now)


[12/07/2022 9:32 PM] question86#0000
I just could do it. Am i in trouble.


[12/07/2022 9:32 PM] Satergo#0000
What?


[12/07/2022 9:32 PM] question86#0000
Satergo updated via popup 2 minutes ago.


[12/07/2022 9:33 PM] Satergo#0000
That's been in since the first version


[12/07/2022 9:33 PM] question86#0000
So it never happened to me before was because i went straight with 4.0.3?


[12/07/2022 9:33 PM] Satergo#0000
Assuming you mean 5.0.3. Then, yeah


[12/07/2022 9:34 PM] Satergo#0000
The idea with automatic updates is that it doesn't even prompt. Just updates and restarts in the background. Start it and leave it style


[12/07/2022 9:34 PM] question86#0000
well i started with 4.0.3 but right now i got the upgrade on 5.0.4 i guess. It did not update before.


[12/07/2022 9:34 PM] question86#0000
Ah wow ok. However, amazing surprise for me.


[12/07/2022 9:34 PM] Satergo#0000
You sure 4 and not 5?


[12/07/2022 9:35 PM] Satergo#0000
I can have made a mistake so that it doesn't compare the first aka major version component


[12/07/2022 9:35 PM] question86#0000
Hm like as sure i can be as someone who uses tech, not creates it. Might have been 5.0.3 but i think i remember correctly.


[12/07/2022 9:35 PM] Satergo#0000
When did you download it


[12/07/2022 9:36 PM] question86#0000
Uff, several months ago.


[12/07/2022 9:36 PM] Satergo#0000
Hmmm


[12/07/2022 9:36 PM] Satergo#0000
Code seems fine


[12/07/2022 9:36 PM] question86#0000
Well, works like a charm. So.. yep. :)


[12/08/2022 12:03 AM] Satergo#0000
4.0.3 was actually released February last year, at which point Satergo didn't exist yet and I had no knowledge of Ergo so it's probably not that one you had.


[12/08/2022 12:32 AM] question86#0000
Totally possible i messed up with the versions.


[12/08/2022 1:31 PM] octopus_shepherd#0000
I've installed the wallet. What should I do to help the network? Open port 9030 is enough? And what means reachable or unreachable on the nodes list?


[12/08/2022 1:38 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @octopus_shepherd : *I've installed the wallet. What should I do to help the network? Open port 9030 is enough? And what means reachable or unreachable on the nodes list?*) 
 
 Open port 9030 and use "Set public address" from the UI


[12/08/2022 1:38 PM] Satergo#0000
Reachable: accepts incoming connections
Unreachable: does not accept incoming connections


[12/08/2022 1:41 PM] octopus_shepherd#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *Open port 9030 and use "Set public address" from the UI*) 
 
 Thanks! I'll set it up!


[12/08/2022 1:53 PM] octopus_shepherd#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *Open port 9030 and use "Set public address" from the UI*) 
 
 It's TCP or UDP?


[12/08/2022 3:20 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @octopus_shepherd : *It's TCP or UDP?*) 
 
 TCP


[12/08/2022 3:21 PM] octopus_shepherd#0000

new node running thanks satergo


[12/10/2022 7:46 PM] Satergo#0000
Welcome


[12/13/2022 8:17 PM] Kenial#0000
Hello, this question doesn't relate to Satergo, so much as general ergo node functionality. If you prefer I ask elsewhere I can. How exactly can I make sure my node is reachable? And what do I have to do to make sure my ports, etc are configured properly? For context I'm running a node off a docker in unRAID.


[12/13/2022 8:18 PM] Kenial#0000
Also, are there any plans to incorporate off chain bot functionality to the Satergo wallet? And could I set up the Satergo wallet/node as a docker?


[12/14/2022 2:03 PM] Satergo#0000
To know if your node is reachable, you can use ergonodes.net.


[12/14/2022 2:04 PM] Satergo#0000
Offchain bots are planned, docker is not.


[12/14/2022 4:32 PM] Satergo#0000
Lol ergonodes.net has saved 2.5 months of statistics so it should be around 75 entries, but guess what, it's more than 1 million entries 😂


[12/14/2022 4:33 PM] Satergo#0000
It's not surprising it takes 30 seconds to restart it


[12/14/2022 4:37 PM] Satergo#0000
The statistic task is scheduled for the last second of the day and it also reschedules itself in the same function, which causes it to infinitely reschedule and execute itself until 1 second has passed. Perfect...


[12/14/2022 4:38 PM] Satergo#0000
Around 77k duplicated saves per day on my computer but the server is probably a little slower


[12/14/2022 4:39 PM] Satergo#0000
No wonder the database is 1.7 GB


[12/14/2022 5:11 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Looool


[12/14/2022 5:41 PM] Satergo#0000
New database size is 184 MB. Much more sensible

update before 2023?


[12/18/2022 10:44 PM] Satergo#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *update before 2023?*) 
 
 I'm thinking of December 23rd


[12/18/2022 10:44 PM] Satergo#0000
It's also the day that non-beta v0.0.1 was released so 1 year anniversary!


[12/18/2022 10:46 PM] Satergo#0000
I do want it to be in that week's developer update but I also simultaneously want to make it coincide with the 1 year anniversary. Tough decision

Aberg do you know why the ipv6 node is listed 440 times


[12/19/2022 1:48 PM] scotman8888#0000
On ergonodes


[12/19/2022 1:51 PM] Satergo#0000
I am aware of it but could not figure out why. As it doesn't affect the statistics I didn't care too much about it


[12/19/2022 2:10 PM] scotman8888#0000
Hopefully it's not something I need to change. I was thinking I would spin up another one but I don't want to pollute the page with another 450

 Sir, you can load a custom stylesheet, so you can make your own theme :)

(re @Ahmad123_321 : *I downloaded the new version and its downloading the blocks. But I cant see my balance. Should I wait until its done ?*) 
 
 We solved this in PMs, it was a wrong seed phrase. For others who wonder, your balance is shown regardless of your node being synced or not.

 So the plan (emphasis on the word "plan") is to make a Windows installer which lets you update with 1 or 2 clicks. With the installer I'll be able to properly register URI schemes like ergo: (which I wrote the code for more than a year ago) and ergopay: (ergopay dApp connection support planned for this release as well).

i just feel in their quest to make it as one button touch as possible, they might be contributing a little bit to dumbing down...but, yes, it allows grandma and grandpa a really easy tool at the same time

Two computing revolutions: one aimed at making things easy and the other making the impossible possible. While Macs do have the command line, it's pretty clear who they cater to and while a straightjacket can be beautiful, I wouldn't want to wear one on the regular.

Dev(s) do you have any thoughts on what it might take to create a built in ergomixer with the code that exists?  I wonder if that would make the wallet more or less appealing overall though


[01/12/2023 2:48 AM] cafebedouin#9837
The mixer is a stand alone app. Presumably it could be downloaded and run the same as a node. But also easy enough to just install it on your OS of choice.

 It would probably be quite hard and at the moment at least, not be worth it.

the node is working normal


[01/13/2023 11:50 AM] Satergo.com#0000
I'm not sure I quite understand what you are saying. You see your funds but not on the home tab? They show in the account tab but not home? The other way?


[01/13/2023 1:26 PM] Erg0sphere#0000
i'm saying, if you press home, i view the wrong funds. I used to have about 200 erg there but now i only have like 2 erg. But it's still showing about 200

MDC should do the job, but yeah, not working on my side as well


[01/14/2023 9:27 PM] Satergo.com#0000
I don't know what mdc is but the line removal reference I sent made it so it doesn't use the logback log level system property but instead uses TRACE and takes override from the conf, which is bad as it makes no sense to require changing the conf for changing log level. I recommend to revert this completely as it was working fine before

Hey @mewtoshi on command line when you start node you can give it a cap of how much ram you want it to be able to use like -Xmx2g

Do you think on startup window you could add this? So user could start node with limited ram availability

(re @lifelessditto : *I ran with sh*) 
 
 sh is pretty old, everybody uses bash or any of the others now. You should just do `./run.sh` in the terminal and that'll use bash

(re @NoahErgo : *Hey @mewtoshi on command line when you start node you can give it a cap of how much ram you want it to be able to use like -Xmx2g

Do you think on startup window you could add this? So user could start node with limited ram availability*) 
 
 Any thoughts? Satergo currently unusable for me on ras pi


[01/20/2023 5:50 PM] Satergo.com#0000
Is the max too low?


[01/20/2023 5:51 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Im guessing its not low enough and the pi gets bogged down


[01/20/2023 5:51 PM] NoahErgo#0000
When running node from terminal i have to cap ram at lower amount on my pi otherwise same thing happens there

[01/20/2023 5:55 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Would it be possible to have some setting in this node-info json for ram amount


[01/20/2023 5:56 PM] Satergo.com#0000
Well, configuring the max ram has been in the todo since a long time now but I don't know how the default max is calculated so it can't be a slider


[01/20/2023 5:56 PM] NoahErgo#0000
could it be something manually configurable in that json file?


[01/20/2023 5:57 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I usually would set it to 2gb when running node from terminal


[01/20/2023 5:58 PM] Satergo.com#0000
I could add that


[01/20/2023 5:58 PM] Satergo.com#0000

If on Windows, bring up Explorer, click Network, and it should display devices on Network. Click device of interest, and IP is listed on bottom.


[01/20/2023 11:47 PM] cafebedouin#9837
If you are on the machine, you can just use localhost:9053 or 127.0.0.1:9053.


[01/20/2023 11:48 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Lots of ways to do it. But, depends on your network and OS.

I'm thinking of doing like I did for the version pie chart and collapse irrelevant and really old versions. I'm thinking of changing the cutoff (right now versions older than 4.0.30 are collapsed) to something higher like maybe 4.0.40


[01/30/2023 8:00 PM] Satergo.com#0000
The versions older than 4.0.41 together make up just 25 of 500 so I think it'll be fine. It's always possible to show them if needed by adding `?noVersionCollapse=on` to the end of the URL anyways

 It is a standard feature that all wallets can easily implement but most don't show it to the user. As far as I know the only ones supporting mnemonic password are Satergo and the node web interface.

No real consensus on how to do it. There is the BTC, where the 25th word is the salt. The mobile wallet reads the 25th word as part of the seed. Not necessarily wrong, but whether it is a salt or seed generates a different address.


[01/31/2023 1:16 PM] cafebedouin#9837

 The problem with just taking it as the "25th word" in the same input is that you need to use one of the valid words I'm pretty sure

 I tried writing an extra word but it did not let me


[01/31/2023 2:28 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Interesting. I haven't tried it myself, but thought I saw MrS say it would take 25th as part of seed.

the reason is that android wallet uses the 25th word as a seedphrase word and in a special way. that's not wrong, but is different than ledger/nautilus treating thr 25th word in a special way. there's no eip for that.


[01/31/2023 3:06 PM] cafebedouin#9837
This is what I linked to, but there's more conversation about how it should be handled. Might need an EIP that just says, we're doing this the bitcoin way.

How much money you can make with a node like 1000ergo?

You don't make any money running a node. It does make submitting your own transactions to the blockchain easier though.

Just portforward and enter your public IP address on your phone


[02/05/2023 5:20 PM] Satergo.com#0000
You can find your public IP from the "Set public address" shortcut

what is portforward?

apologies for normie qs


[02/05/2023 5:22 PM] Satergo.com#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *what is portforward?*) 
 
 A functionality of your router that enables incoming connections from other networks


[02/05/2023 5:23 PM] NoahErgo#0000
gotcha that makes sense


[02/05/2023 5:23 PM] Satergo.com#0000
You only forward one or two ports and of a specific device so they cannot access other things (like camera etc)


[02/05/2023 5:23 PM] FlyingPig#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *ok will try this*) 
 
 Ports are like doors that are used for people outside your network to access.

By default most routers lock all the doors.

But you can unlock one door by setting it in your router.


[02/05/2023 5:23 PM] NoahErgo#0000
will be different for every router most likely then

[02/05/2023 5:43 PM] NoahErgo#0000
so i put in 9030, 9053 for port range


[02/05/2023 5:43 PM] FlyingPig#0000
You need to open the port your node uses on the internal network.

Let's say that is 9053.

In your router find port forwarding.
There will be an input and outport port (or something along those lines).

The output port will be the ports on your local network the node uses (9053 and 9030 as per Aaberg and qx.).

The input port can be the same, but you could also chose different ones, but then you'll need to configure the wallet your using outside of the network to connect to the input ports.

Think of it as routing rules.

For sending txs you only need 9053. 9030 is for peer to peer.


[02/05/2023 5:45 PM] NoahErgo#0000

 Before you start check that you wrote down your seed phrase


[02/07/2023 6:25 AM] Victorius1994#0000
Okay i have it , i just thought i can refresh the version without that

That's good. This warning always appears (doesn't affect anything)

Just open the .erg file from where you saved it


[02/07/2023 7:48 AM] Satergo.com#0000
It is better to do that than restoring because your address names will be kept

Maybe, I thought it was the in-between. Bringing buyers in Monero with sellers using Amazon. Although, they also seem to be doing some of the selling themselves, which you would have to until there was a community around it. But, didn't get too deep into it.

 It is an interesting project but unfortunately not feasible for me to redo for Ergo due to the nature of the service itself


[02/08/2023 7:32 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Depends on the person behind it too. If they aren't a Monero maxi, they might be open to incorporating other cryptocurrencies. Then, it's just adding a payment channel. But, no matter, thought you might find the service of interest because it uses Monero in a way I think is interesting and likely going to be a feature in ecosystems.

I'm pretty sure it would work. In terms of the implementation I used the other stratum server as a reference so it not working it would probably just be due to a small mistake or something, which I can fix as soon as you notify me. Your choice though :)

Some or all of these features are going to be in the next release:

- Windows installer
- Simple updating on Windows
- Ergopay
- Ergo address links
- Ledger
- Deeper node configuration
- Transaction history: recognizing some DeFi transactions and labelling them (for example ergopad staking and unstaking, spectrum trading)
- Transaction exporting
_- Perhaps more that I have forgotten_

(re @Alex : *hey Satergo team, looks like node duplicate on ergonodes*) 
 
 Yeah, but it doesn't affect the statistics. Only the API and browse nodes section. I've tried to fix it but cannot find the cause. Only happens with that node (maybe because it is IPv6)


[02/21/2023 4:00 PM] Satergo.com#0000
I'll take a look tomorrow or the day after that. If I can't find the source I'll just filter before sending the response lol


[02/21/2023 4:01 PM] Satergo.com#0000

The difference is that he got the error from Satergo itself (and not the node log in Satergo) but you got it from the node (so, completely different things)

Yes but Mac has some security features that disallow running programs that are not signed with their paid license subscription. So you need to disable that limitation to run the program

(re @mewtoshi : *@kushti_ru What is better as default log level? warn or error?*) 
 
 For debugging warn


[03/05/2023 3:37 PM] kushti#0000
With ERR you will see only very critical messages


[03/05/2023 3:40 PM] Satergo.com#0000
But by default when a user installs satergo and spins up a node, it should be ERROR, right?


[03/05/2023 4:15 PM] Satergo.com#0000
@kushti_ru I think the node is broken. I have it set to ERROR level, confirmed by this being printed: "INFO  [main] o.e.settings.ErgoSettings$ - Log level set to ERROR". But, that message is of INFO level and I also get some INFO messages after that.


[03/05/2023 4:17 PM] Satergo.com#0000
Those messages coming afterwards are of a different format as well, like:
[INFO] [akkaDeadLetter][date time] [ergoref-akka.actor.default-dispatcher-10] [akka://ergoref/user/$d]
instead of
time INFO [main] classname - message


[03/05/2023 4:20 PM] Satergo.com#0000
honestly, logging was much better before these changes. to allow changing the level from .conf you could have just set the logback log level system property value to the conf value if it was unset


[03/05/2023 4:31 PM] Satergo.com#0000
(unrelated) (left = old, right = new)

I decided to change how the log level is configured. It could be confusing that there is a combo box just saying [ERROR] to a new user and changing the log level isn't something you do often.

Also, having all that stuff under a badly named [...] menu was not optimal

Seems to be more reliable than ergoplatform's testnet explorer so I'll go with it. it can always be changed anyways


[03/05/2023 11:48 PM] Satergo.com#0000
Guys, I was planning to add Linux Arm32 support. It was initially in the build procedure but due to some unclear things _(a platform-independent module had the 64-bit naming but actually applied to both 64 and 32-bit, so I thought there is no module for 32-bit)_ I scrapped it.

Well, the only relevant 32-bit Linux device at this point is Raspberry Pi 3. But it only has 1 GB of RAM so I am quite unsure that it would support running a node anyways.
But, Satergo can also be used with a remote node so it could be of some people's interests to have a cheap old device to run Satergo on.

I'm unsure if I should add support for 32-bit ARM Linux or not, I need some advice


[03/05/2023 11:52 PM] Satergo.com#0000
I mean, nobody has requested this yet and it has actually led some Raspberry Pi 4 users to switch to the 64-bit OS (which is much better). People who need 32-bit ARM can always run from the source or compile it by themselves (after removing the limitation in the build script)


[03/05/2023 11:53 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Seems an unnecessary edge case

So there was an address book idea planned for a long time and some parts of the code reference it but I never implemented it, and now that I think about it maybe it is not necessary?

I can see both good and bad things with it. It can help not messing up when you are sending to your exchange (because unfortuantely most exchanges do not let you change your deposit address...).

It can help with keeping a donation address so that you can donate periodically to some project

But for friends and family it very much promotes address reuse. Now, Satergo does not help you avoid address reuse at all but an address book would promote such usage while right now the wallet is neutral in promoting it.

I am asking for your opinions on this.

Perhaps a dumb question, but can an address be a sharable, extended public key that derives new addresses for receivers?

(re  : *<cafebedouin> Perhaps a dumb question, but can an address be a sharable, extended public key that derives new addresses for receivers?*) 
 
 It can be done but would require a complex system to keep track of what has been exposed and what has not. It would also have to be a subkey so that your entire public key list does not get exposed. It takes quite a lot of work to implement on both sides and would be guaranteed to confuse users

[04/07/2023 11:41 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Agree. I was thinking more in terms of a wallet with built-in mixing for bitcoin, not so much their chosen implementation.


[04/07/2023 12:25 PM] Pavel#0000
Why do we need Bitcoin mixing if we have Monero (BTC -> Monero -> BTC)?
Mixed BTC becomes tainted

        Ok. You have BTC (clean). You want some privacy. 
We have several CEXes w/o KYC.
So you send your BTC to nonKYC cex, exchange it to Monero. Withdraw it to another nonKYC account or your wallet.
Sell Monero and buy BTC.
Withdraw your "new" clean BTC from nonKYC CEX to a new BTC wallet.
Of course it's not 100% anonymous and risk free


[04/07/2023 12:32 PM] Pavel#0000
If you have BTC (tainted), use bridge to Monero, send Monero to nonKYC CEX and exchange it to clean BTC

Some or all of these features are going to be in the next release:

1. [  ] Windows installer
2. [  ] Simple updating on Windows
3. [  ] Ergopay
4. [  ] Ergo address links
5  [  ] Ledger
6. [x] Deeper node configuration
7. [  ] Transaction history: recognizing some DeFi transactions and labelling them (for example ergopad staking and unstaking, spectrum trading)
8. [  ] Transaction exporting
9. [x] All fiat currencies with CoinGecko price source

Improved memory usage & thread count 👍
Of course the garbage collector handled them when they got too many in the "before" version but now the extra threads never add up, which makes the application lighter and as can be seen, the total memory allocated less.

To test I sped up the periods of the repeating tasks that did network things by 6x so normal usage of the application would not look like this in either version.

        You can always run from source, the commit was pushed as soon as it was finished. (Unlike previous work where I usually did one big commit right before release)

You won't notice anything though, it is just that the application memory use is a little lighter now

I plan to add a warning popup for ErgoPay & Ledger that makes it clear that the features are new and that I cannot be considered responsible for any loss if the user decides to use them.

This could however be changed if some people decide to run the wallet from source before release and confirm that it is not bugged. Any volunteers? (To be clear, the features are not published yet.)

        Happy to test ledger if you want.
I have now have a ledger wallet I use for testing stuff...inc Paideia.im which does not support ledger (or ergopay) yet I discovered.



.Did the same with Nautilus last year....didn't lose anything (🤞).

As long as it's easy to compile from source as well.


[04/18/2023 12:07 AM] Satergo.com#0000
You just install a JDK and run one command to start the application from source

        Building Java applications is very simple, thankfully. No list of dependencies that you need to install to your system and then probably not know which ones you had and didn't so you don't know if you can uninstall them. No need to move around directories, no need to have etc. Just invoke the build tool 👍

        Hard coding is a terrible solution and was made before I had made my "ergonnection" (ergo p2p client library) library so when I am to improve it I would switch to that instead of keeping the hard coding

I would however happily add your node to the list of known nodes (from where other nodes are discovered, as I would prefer not to rely on ergonodes.net - centralization risk, even though I'm the author of both.. haha)

different seed for the node wallet vs satergo wallet im pretty sure...meaning, satergo front end wallet is not the same if you create a wallet on the back end node of satergo....could be wrong tho, im sure aberg will correct when he wakes.

the node is probably asking for the mnemonic password which you won't have if the original address was made with ergo mobile.
