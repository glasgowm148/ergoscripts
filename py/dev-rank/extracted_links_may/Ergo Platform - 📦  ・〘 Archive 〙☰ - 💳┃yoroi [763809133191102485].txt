Will import from coinbarn work?

"You can migrate from CoinBarn -> Yoroi with the same recovery phrase

"Coinbarn only supports one address for the whole wallet, where as Yoroi allows creation of multiple addresses"


[10/10/2020 10:16 AM] gtklocker#2347
aha so yoroi also covers the edge case of generating and checking the p2pk address coming directly from the master key?


[10/10/2020 10:17 AM] gtklocker#2347
I see thanks


[10/10/2020 10:17 AM] gtklocker#2347
where was this posted?


[10/10/2020 10:18 AM] mx#5165
on telegram some time ago so node-Yoroi should be ok already


[10/10/2020 10:31 AM] Robert K#0722
But only for newly generated wallets using the latest version of the node

Hi guys,
I'm helding some Ergs on Hotbit and I'd like to transfer them to Yoroi Wallet, but when I open the wallet only propose me and Shelley or Byron wallet, how could I create an Ergo address? Thanks!


[10/28/2020 11:54 PM] Sebastien#0653
@GER are you on the latest version of the Yoroi Extension? (3.7.3)


[10/30/2020 3:49 PM] GER#8806
@Sebastien Nop! 3.3.1 where could I download that one (3.7.3)? Thanks man.


[10/30/2020 6:10 PM] Sebastien#0653
@GER sounds like you're using Yoroi Mobile which doesn't have Ergo support yet. Currently we only support Ergo through the Yoroi Extension


[10/30/2020 6:58 PM] GER#8806
@Sebastien thanks, I'll search it at the Ergo website

[11/08/2020 8:56 PM] kushti#0978
@16739263 currently you can send a transaction when previous is confirmed only.


[11/08/2020 8:57 PM] 16739263#7960
@kushti oh okay, my apologies


[11/15/2020 3:58 PM] anon_real#2768
When sending a transaction with "Send all ERG" enabled, Yoroi will also send all available tokens in the wallet alongside the ERGs. Although Yoroi doesn't really support tokens yet, it doesn't seem like the best behavior I think.


[11/15/2020 4:01 PM] anon_real#2768
Not a big deal for now, but better for people to know since they may participate in auctions and end up winning some tokens!


[11/16/2020 8:19 AM] Robert K#0722
Ah, yeah Yoroi tracks tokens in the backend so that they don't get burned. And the default case there ends up being if you send all Ergs, when then you send all your tokens since you have no boxes left too.


[11/16/2020 8:20 AM] Robert K#0722
That likely should be addressed once full token support is implemented, good point @anon_real.

My Yoroi wallet does not sync. It gets 500 response, "error: "REFERENCE_BLOCK_MISMATCH" when calling `/history`. Any idea?


[11/16/2020 11:05 AM] kushti#0978
@anon_real @Robert K well, if all the ergs sent out, no ergs for storing the tokens then, so it is okay then to send the tokens also I guess, at least for now ?


[11/16/2020 11:43 AM] anon_real#2768
> @anon_real @Robert K well, if all the ergs sent out, no ergs for storing the tokens then, so it is okay then to send the tokens also I guess, at least for now ?
@kushti Yeah, as long as people who care know the behavior.

> My Yoroi wallet does not sync. It gets 500 response, "error: "REFERENCE_BLOCK_MISMATCH" when calling `/history`. Any idea?
I tried restoring in another browser, but it couldn't find all my ERGs, only some of them!


[11/16/2020 11:56 AM] anon_real#2768
Also, I tried "Resync wallet" in the settings in my original browser, after a while it synced but again shows only some of my ERGs.


[11/16/2020 12:44 PM] Robert K#0722
@Sebastien any ideas on the above?


[11/16/2020 1:08 PM] kushti#0978
@anon_real have you checked against the explorer?


[11/16/2020 1:15 PM] anon_real#2768
I checked again now and it updated my balance to the right amount. However, it didn't before for a long time even though all requests to the backed were successful.


[11/16/2020 1:18 PM] anon_real#2768
I tried restoring again in the other browser and works fine now! Don't know what it could be about before.


[11/16/2020 2:57 PM] Sebastien#0653
`REFERENCE_BLOCK_MISMATCH` is caused when the transaction history stored in your Yoroi wallet no longer matches the blockchain in the explorer. It's caused whenever a rollback happens that undoes one of your transactions.
When this error happens, Yoroi tries to rollback your transaction history and then resync, which is why part of your wallet went missing. If the explorer was having issues as you mentioned (hence being slow), that's probably why it wasn't able to resync fully and you were left with a partially rolled back wallet.

[11/16/2020 2:59 PM] Sebastien#0653
That's my best guess for the series of events that led to your issue. It could always be a bug somewhere, so don't hesitate to let me know if you think that doesn't sound accurate!


[11/16/2020 4:12 PM] anon_real#2768
@Sebastien Will do, thanks!

Hello everyone
Happy New Year to you all.
Sorry for this weird question, I'm New to Ergo.
Is Yoroi Ergo wallet ready to use?


[01/02/2021 11:41 PM] kushti#0978
@Storm yes, browser extension for now only available though

Hi...so I'm new to the space of cryptocurrency/blockchain, and I recently set up a Yoroi wallet and transferred both ERG and ADA to it. I'm confused on why one of my generated addresses it not showing a sum? When clicked and taken to Cardanoscan it states that there are two transactions (received and sent 9k~ ADA). My total ADA shown in my wallet is correct, but just curious why it appears different than the other transactions I sent.

[01/20/2021 10:52 PM] egorishek#5517
Looks like the missing balance (sum) is listed under the internal tab. If someone could explain how/why that transaction is listed under the internal tab vs external would be much appreciated.


[01/23/2021 2:12 PM] Sebastien#0653
@egorishek it comes from BIP44 and the UTXO system if you want to learn more


[01/23/2021 2:12 PM] Sebastien#0653
we have a link to a blog post in the internal tab that explains it also I think


[01/23/2021 9:53 PM] egorishek#5517
@Sebastien Great! I‚Äôll definitely check it out. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction.


[02/04/2021 2:04 PM] MrSupercool#7391
At some point will you be able to Swap ERG for ADA in the Yoroi wallet?


[02/04/2021 11:14 PM] MrSupercool#7391
@kush02 At some point will you be able to Swap ERG for ADA in the Yoroi wallet?

My pal sent me these - its working now, but just for posterity


[02/11/2021 8:00 PM] Bauhaus911#7350
Just installed yoroi extension in my browser (Brave) and put in my mnemonic phrase expecting my wallet address to be the same as what shows in my ERGO reference node implementation, but it is not.  Surpsingly, it IS showing some ergs, but it shows about half the # of ergs I see when I use the ERGO reference node.  Could it be it is showing ergs from before the hard fork?


[02/11/2021 8:10 PM] Bauhaus911#7350
If Yoroi supports hardware wallets, does that mean I can store my ERGs into a hardware wallet as long as it is supported by Yoroi?


[02/12/2021 2:21 AM] Claydo#3635
@Bauhaus911 I think I read on their development roadmap that they are working on ledger support for ERG on Yoroi. Not sure, but I don't think it's out yet.


[02/12/2021 10:04 AM] kushti#0978
@Bauhaus911 how many addresses do you have in your node ? Maybe you need to derive new addresses in Yoroi to see the full balance


[02/13/2021 7:48 AM] glasgowm#9381
A refresh button on the yoroi would be useful, on chrome/osx - doesn't seem to pick up new stuff until I F5

Yoroi node on wrong blockchain?


[02/14/2021 11:23 AM] DrakeR#0734
I think what Yoroi in wrong blockchain, wallet deposit 0.000. But in blockchain i have many ERG.


[02/14/2021 11:28 AM] Ilya | Spectrum#0494
The problem is likely with the explorer their backend relies on


[02/14/2021 11:29 AM] Ilya | Spectrum#0494
It is out of sync


[02/14/2021 11:30 AM] Ilya | Spectrum#0494
The Ergo network itself is consistent


[02/14/2021 11:32 AM] DrakeR#0734

[02/14/2021 6:16 PM] bitsolver#7337
hello all -- I've created my first Ergo wallet in Yoroi and sent 10 ERG to it from CoinEx... CoinEx says the tx is complete, the tx currently has 80 confirmations, my receiving address on the explorer says it has the 10 ERG in it, but Yoroi says zero and no transactions... I've re-synced several times, and even removed and restored my wallet (and re-verified my receiving address is still the same, etc...) -- reading the posts above, it looks like Yoroi's Ergo node might be out of sync right now... does anyone have an update, or can anyone point me to a status page, or somewhere I can watch for updates?

Yea gotta be patient with coin ex to yoroi. Took a few hours/day to process


[02/15/2021 12:56 AM] TOXid#0099
It was possible to restore the seed from yoroi to a full node. But there is a very serious problem with a wallet on a full node - when transferring from a wallet, it transfers the amount remaining after the transaction to another address, but this address is not added to the wallet list.


[02/15/2021 11:17 PM] kushti#0978

If you are sure that the address in Yoroi  and in the explorer matches, you can restore the wallet in the full node wallet using the seed. Only here is a bug with the disappearance of the balance after the transfer possible - so transfer the entire amount at once.


[02/18/2021 5:12 PM] Pancakes#6139
@TOXid thank you. It actually ended up resynching in the yoroi wallet and now the correct amount is showing. Thanks for your help. I was actually considering that.


[02/21/2021 8:26 PM] êé∑êé±êé°êéΩ#7312
hello i tried for fun to restore a ERG wallet on yoroi mobile (yes the one that doesnt support erg yet). i was surprised because my erg private key was recognized in yoroi mobile when i restored it (in a ADA wallet off course).   so a ada wallet-empty-  is restored with the erg key lol..


[02/21/2021 8:26 PM] êé∑êé±êé°êéΩ#7312
i'm not a expert but i don't understand why the key was recognized because it is 2 different blockchain right ?  if anyone got an explanation just because i'm quite curious!


[02/21/2021 8:27 PM] Robert K#0722
Your mnemonic can be used to derive an infinite number of keys technically, for various blockchains


[02/21/2021 8:28 PM] êé∑êé±êé°êéΩ#7312
oooh so its just coincidence right?


[02/21/2021 8:28 PM] Robert K#0722
It's a way to effectively have a human-readable seed that can always be used to create a wallet


[02/21/2021 8:28 PM] êé∑êé±êé°êéΩ#7312
interesting


[02/21/2021 8:28 PM] Robert K#0722
And the process is deterministic for each, but work slightly differently for each


[02/21/2021 8:29 PM] Robert K#0722
So if you want to you can just have 1 mnemonic and reuse it for having both Ada and Erg wallets


[02/21/2021 8:29 PM] êé∑êé±êé°êéΩ#7312
i never "played" with mnemonics before that so i was surprised^^


[02/21/2021 8:30 PM] êé∑êé±êé°êéΩ#7312
really uuh


[02/21/2021 8:30 PM] êé∑êé±êé°êéΩ#7312
thank you for theses details


[02/22/2021 8:57 AM] Taegus#5853
Basically a mnemonic seed is just a string of words from which you calculate a number. A private key in every blockchain is just a very big number represented in alphanumeric way


[02/22/2021 8:57 AM] Taegus#5853
So you can have same seed but calculate it in a different way for different blockchain. But only if seed calculation uses the same words and same number of them ofc


[02/22/2021 8:58 AM] Taegus#5853
You could also have the exact same calculation and get exact same keys for two different blockchains


[02/22/2021 8:58 AM] Taegus#5853
Not a problem


[02/22/2021 8:59 AM] Taegus#5853
Basically how security for keys work on all blockchains is that the space of all possible numbers is so big its basically impossible to guess an existing key


[02/22/2021 8:59 AM] Taegus#5853
There is a cloud network of computers trying BTC keys and I think they actually found some small amounts already lol


[02/22/2021 3:21 PM] Bauhaus911#7350
@Sebastien How do you detect when an incoming payment occurs?  I've got a light iPhone app that communicates with the ERGO reference node implementation and can't figure out how I might get at receipts.  Do you poll periodically or is it event driven (catching and logging those receipts)?


[02/22/2021 3:21 PM] Sebastien#0653
@Bauhaus911 Yoroi polls our server every ~20 seconds


[02/22/2021 3:24 PM] Bauhaus911#7350
And on the server, what is the algorithm to split apart payments from receipts?  Do you keep a copy of transactions and then compare that with what is polled after 20 secs?


[02/22/2021 6:49 PM] Taegus#5853
@Sebastien Did you thought about using web sockets to reduce the request count from pooling?

those are the two backends we run: one for Cardano and one for Ergo


[02/22/2021 6:51 PM] Sebastien#0653
we've looked into websockets multiple times before but there always ends up being something that makes REST the only choice that really works across all use cases


[02/22/2021 6:59 PM] Taegus#5853
Yea same when I was trying and checking it for our cloud wallet. Was wondering if you had any more luck with it


[02/24/2021 4:29 PM] gtklocker#2347
will it not be possible to reset an ergo node seed with yoroi? I can restore the seed but different addresses are generated unfortunately


[02/24/2021 5:03 PM] Robert K#0722
You can if your node wallet was generated after node v3.3.4 (I think that's the version)


[02/24/2021 5:04 PM] Robert K#0722
Somewhere around that version the address derivation was synced between the two.


[02/25/2021 9:22 AM] gtklocker#2347
I created my node wallet on 4.0.7 and import didn't work, different address was generated


[02/25/2021 9:23 AM] gtklocker#2347
I think it was a 15 word seed?


[02/25/2021 9:24 AM] gtklocker#2347
I will share a more detailed bug report, what is the appropriate repo?


[02/25/2021 9:38 AM] Robert K#0722
Did you use a mnemonic password?


[02/25/2021 9:39 AM] Robert K#0722
Because they aren't supported in Yoroi


[02/25/2021 9:39 AM] Robert K#0722
Could be good to try going from Yoroi mnemonic -> Node as well. Nonetheless I think https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo is the best repo

You can see it in the send tab


[02/26/2021 3:32 PM] bitsolver#7337
yeah, it's kinda buried there tho... not very easily discoverable... will the ADA wallets handle multi-tokens the same way? it'd be nice if there were a new "All Tokens" or "All Balances" tab or something... just an idea...


[02/27/2021 2:22 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134

the send confirmation page already tells you that you are sending all your tokens as well

If people tend to ignore this, I can add a second warning on top of this though

Great to here that. I am lacking of this very much. May be sometimes I can help with this (unfortunately I am Python dev, not JS and it is simplier to me write a python script for myself. But I will pay attention at Yoroi when will be acking for spending boxes).

Hi,  I was one of those people, who sent sigRSV to Coinex exchange (through "send all ERG" checkbox). During more then 10 days I'm trying to explain them that they have to send sigRSV tokens back to my yoroi wallet, but it seems useless. I wonder if they don't understand what are sigRSV tokens or they can't do that. Is there any chance that they will send me back sigRSV tokens or they are lost forever?


[03/09/2021 1:27 AM] JamesKelley#2466
I wonder if support could put you in touch with whoever manages their wallets. I'd send along a link to the transaction that shows the asset included so they won't need to search for it.


[03/09/2021 3:05 PM] Karen094#8565
Yeah, I have done it. I contacted them through telegram and e-mail and in both cases sent them links to ergo explorer (transaction and wallet address). Moreover, I sent them screenshots where I clicked on button in explorer "show tokens" to make them see that sigRSV tokens are there. Even a child would understand what's the issue after all my broad explanations.


[03/20/2021 3:53 PM] Ilya | Spectrum#0494
@mmahut, hey!
Please update yoroi backend schema ASAP:
`alter table tokens alter column name type varchar`
This will remove length constraint from token name.
It seems constraining any fields according to their semantics was generally a bad idea. In practice people are putting random text to fields which are supposed to hold short token tickers according to the standard.

I'm newer to the crypto world but as a community advisor one of my jobs in catalyst is to help out where I can, and I think your proposal would better fit under Dapps challenge. the dev ecosystem it's currently under is more about making the dev environment better, and the yoroi connector has real utility that it would provide to the end users.


[04/14/2021 8:00 AM] Sebastien#0653
ah fk I messed up the category for two of our proposals and you can't edit the category of a submitted proposal :/


[04/14/2021 8:00 AM] Sebastien#0653
what is the best solution? Delete this proposal and re-submit a new one in the correct category? Or can mods move the category for us?

if I'm trying to withdraw from hotbit to yoroi, I only see that the "erg" blockchain is available, the withdrawal failed, so can I assume I need to transfer it to a private ergo node first & then get it to that wallet somehow?


[04/14/2021 10:32 AM] Busata#9432
or is it just hotbit shenanigans?


[04/14/2021 5:14 PM] Dergler#0451
not sure what you mean by this, do you have an ERG wallet in yoroi? yoroi can have ADA and ERG.


[04/14/2021 6:52 PM] Busata#9432
nvm, it's just hotbit being tiring I think

@Sebastien what should I do in my app to be able to have access to dApp connector's functionalities like simply `ergo_request_read_access`? seems like the only ergo-related dependency in the example you provided is  `ergo-lib-wasm-browser` 
Sorry for the noob question )


[04/16/2021 1:40 PM] Sebastien#0653
Yes. `ergo_request_read_access` is injected into the page by the dApp connector

it's injected as long as you have the dApp connector extension installed

You can use erg to provide liquidity to Coinex AMM pool if you‚Äôre looking to put your erg to work. Just research impermanent loss before making a big deposit

I tried sending some ERG to the same UTXO where the RSV is to try and get it 'unstuck' but no luck. Last idea would be to use the 'send all assets' option to try and get it to show.

I've also been told that using a full node wallet would allow me access, but that's a bit above my knowledge level. :/

@Sebastien @Robert K 
This seems to be a bug in Yoroi. @Deleted User has 15000 SigRSV in his address (https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/addresses/9fLarG9A2StUc3KipQvvSTpsiDUULfSAqJ1fF5H7fjXJJ3QeoaX) but Yoroi doesn't show it even though it is synced.


[05/06/2021 8:17 AM] Dmitry Usov#0134
I‚Äôve seen it before. Also, when the user submitted all their tokens, sigrsv did not go


[05/06/2021 8:18 AM] Dmitry Usov#0134
Idk what is this. But as I remember his have 2 transactions with the same amount, like 15000 in one and 15000 in second Txid.


[05/06/2021 9:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
Nah, there is only 1 tx with 15000 rsv. I‚Äôm going to try the ‚Äòsend all assets‚Äô feature today and move everything to a new wallet. If that doesn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôll try coinbarn with the old ‚Äúempty‚Äù wallet to try and get the rsv. Just don‚Äôt want to use coinbarn on my main wallet until I‚Äôve moved the funds


[05/06/2021 10:09 AM] Dmitry Usov#0134
Maybe problem with 15.000?))


[05/06/2021 4:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don't think it's a problem with the 15,000. It shows fine on chain and the transaction looks like any other from that contract. Just for some reason, Yoroi is not seeing all of the txs on that UTXO


[05/06/2021 7:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok. 'Send all Assets' didn't work. And neither does coinbarn. Not sure how to proceed. Any ideas short of trying to figure out how to run a full node wallet?


[05/06/2021 7:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
Would really appreciate some further help with this. If anyone has a full node, I will transfer my funds out of the wallet and send you the private key so you can try and send the 15k RSV. I know it's only $80 or whatever, but 20erg could be worth a lot more one day. üòõ

Yoroi is in serious need of multistage verification specifically related to that send all feature.

It's problematic for users at the moment. They need to be protected from themselves. 

 Exchanges are not being very friendly reversing unsupported native assets. 

Imo, It's like a launch button without a safety cover. Clumsy users are creating a lot of problems here.

Is this affecting a lot of people?


[05/26/2021 10:47 PM] verioxn#7730
@geezar I just signed up to discord to find more information on this. My wallet got screwed up too and is stuck syncing/gives a similar error message in the log

sorry to hear that - have you approached the Dev team from yoroi via github ?


[05/26/2021 10:52 PM] geezar#8187
perhaps they are on here too - just noticed that post and curious

Does Yoroi have a discord


[05/26/2021 10:57 PM] Dergler#0451
don't think so, since it's a product of EMURGO and not a community thing.


[05/26/2021 10:58 PM] HeyI'mGary#5435
I reached out to their support on both Twitter and through their website


[05/26/2021 10:59 PM] Dergler#0451
the best contact we had (Sebastien) at EMURGO for wallet support left. we're supposed to be getting new people to work with but honestly I haven't seen them around yet. hopefully this gets seen.

The box that it is claiming has an invalid structure, is an output. Any idea why?

I followed https://github.com/Emurgo/yoroi-frontend/blob/821638d29553bc1c780bd215806acc4e1ffcc83e/packages/yoroi-ergo-connector/example/index.js for creating and signing my tx.

I don't know anyone here currently working on Yoroi to tag them, I thought you may know something )


[05/27/2021 1:49 PM] Ilya | Spectrum#0494
I guess the problem is that currently Yoroi expects `UnsignedTx` to contain `outputs: ErgoBox[]` rather than `outputs: ErgoBoxCandidate[]`.

Both Yoroi nighty and dApp connector are the latest versions for me!


[05/27/2021 1:53 PM] anon_real#2768
Also, there are some other inconsistencies between sigma-rust and the connector. Some manual intervention is needed to provide what the connector expects for it.


[05/27/2021 1:54 PM] anon_real#2768
@Ilya | Spectrum Do you think this will be merged rather soon?


[05/27/2021 1:56 PM] greenhat#6562
I suppose it's because you're using v0. 13 of sigma-rust and dapp connector is still using an older version. In this case PR linked by @Ilya | Spectrum should fix it.


[05/27/2021 1:56 PM] anon_real#2768
I see


[05/27/2021 1:58 PM] greenhat#6562
As a workaround you can use sigma-rust v0.12 till dapp connector is updated.


[05/27/2021 2:06 PM] anon_real#2768
Just did, yoroi crashes when `sign_tx` is called without any errors. I'd better wait for the PR to be merged, will be easier to debug I guess. Thanks!


[05/27/2021 2:13 PM] greenhat#6562
Oh, my bad. I thought of using the same version as yoroi. It's v0.10. It should work.

if people are upset that light wallets can't always provide them 100% uptime, moving to an exchange which also occasionally goes down and imposes a bunch of restrictions isn't the right direction. They should be moving to fullnode wallets if they really want more control over their funds without having to rely on 3rd parties

Sorry if my comment was taken as an assault on you (if you're from Yoroi).  Just sucks that people are switching to an exchange over this even though if they check their wallet on the network... their ergo is there

it worked well for me yesterday


[06/01/2021 3:38 PM] geezar#8187
Personally having a wallet that 'may not work well' is not a great option, whilst commits are being done and recovery seems quickly done by the Yorio team... Full Node the way to go or exchange IMO


[06/01/2021 3:54 PM] arokace#8057
You had me at full node... then you lost it all when you said exchanges.  At least with Yoroi it is still YOUR wallet.  An exchange wallet is never yours, its the exchanges, you don't have a seed, a phrase, no recovery at all just the hopes that if something does go wrong on their side that they are good peolpe.  

With Yoroi, they don't have control of your wallet, could you lose yea but they can't get access to your stuff unless they were logging all that recovery stuff when you made it.  So yea still hoping they are good people too.

Exchanges are there as an option to reduce fees if your just going to sell into other coins - the point is I've used Exchanges like Trade Ogre for years now and never lost anything, Yorioi does not have the same legacy - each to their own. For me Node

@glasgowm  @scalahub  who is now yoroi lead dev?  pls tell them to put entire yoroi app/server run it on twitter.com/RunOnFlux

Use flux as decentralized server backend never have outages. Important that backend is robust as soon as ergo garners more mainstream attention later.


[06/03/2021 8:49 AM] glasgowm#9381
I don't think any of the issues so far have been related to server outage. Not sure who the lead dev is but I've been adding people to the Emurgo group

[06/03/2021 3:59 PM] Ilya | Spectrum#0494
I haven't tried building it from source, currently we're working with the old version


[06/03/2021 6:25 PM] anon_real#2768
So how are you bypassing fields that it needs in the output boxes like `boxId`? Are you using an old version of sigma rust for that?


[06/03/2021 6:47 PM] anon_real#2768
@Ilya | Spectrum anyway, dApp connector seems to have other problems besides data incompatibility. I have a perfectly fine unsigned transaction, but when it tries to sign the tx, I get "Yoroi Crashed".


[06/03/2021 6:47 PM] anon_real#2768
@greenhat I remember you said sigma-rust should be able to sign for auction contracts, right?


[06/03/2021 6:48 PM] anon_real#2768
Just want to make sure the crash is not because of the auction box in the input.

@anon_real have you encountered a problem that Yoroi produces invalid signatures for regular (p2pk ) inputs?

With sigma-rust yes, but not with the dapp connector. @greenhat could this be related?

[06/09/2021 4:50 PM] Ilya | Spectrum#0494
The affected piece is ProveDLog constant at index 0.
This one is from original tree:
`{0} -> ConstantNode(SigmaProp(ProveDlog(ECPoint(b14e30,afc548,...))),SSigmaProp)`

And this one from the tree I'm getting from SigmaRust:
`{0} -> ConstantNode(SigmaProp(ProveDlog(ECPoint(217daf,5c2454,...))),SSigmaProp)`

Hi! I've tried to reproduce it with no luck. I suspect you're using old ergo-lib version. In your branch v0.1.0 it's old `0.14.0-alpha-c42b78c`. Please, try 0.13.2 released yesterday.

Hey! I've got a bug in yoroi where only some of my assets appear in the send tab. After investigating the box where my 'missing' assets went and comparing against addresses in yoroi I found that I do own the box. This happened after purchasing sigRSV from sigmausd.io. in parallel, sigmausd.io doesn't show the assets and has incorrect balance of sigRSV/ERG.

I restored the wallet on a full node and everything is there, all good and dandy. @anon_real  tagged just in case you're interested in tracking down the bug on the sigusd.io side. anyone from EMURGO Interested? DM and I'll share the transaction where the split happened.

SigmaUSD only looks at the address you've configured in the site for balance. It doesn't have access to your whole Yoroi wallet (other addresses)

[07/22/2021 2:21 PM] danandbeard#2312
random though: woudl yoroi ever be open to being a "dapp store" of sorts?  e.g. someone sets up a crowdfunding dapp and doesn't want to host an app on a server - maybe a yoroi user could visit the dapp store to download/launch the dapp - maybe the dapp is just a browser extension itself, but yoroi does seem well positioned to be a good centralized place to discover dapps which can often struggle with discoverability


[07/22/2021 2:37 PM] danandbeard#2312
~~lol, I guess I should read up on yoroi before I propose ideas already being worked on xD -~~ or maybe the thing I'm reading is about connectors and not so much centralizing discovery

I accidentally "send all assets" from my mined ERG yoroi wallet to Hotbit ERG address. It was too late when I found out in the pending transaction that my SigmaRSV was also sent to the address.

also, the ability for technical users to send transactions formatted as JSON requests would be great. Having to download the entire blockchain and wait for wallet scans to work with contracts is a pain.

it's possible to create an ERG token, which when received in Yoroi kinda looks like you're receiving the real thing, someone not so familiar with crypto might mistake it for an actual payment, perhaps a UI change is needed?

[08/05/2021 7:34 PM] bk#4411
not yet


[08/09/2021 8:58 PM] BoTD#6559
I've lost my spending wallet password and I'm trying to recover it, any advice?


[08/10/2021 1:15 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
Restore a new wallet with your seed phrase is your only option I think!


[08/11/2021 1:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
How much % does yoroi take for withdrawal? Is it 10% ?


[08/11/2021 1:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
If I wanted to transfer my erg to an exchabge for example


[08/11/2021 1:53 AM] bk#4411
0%  just the normal transaction fee (.0011 ERG)


[08/11/2021 1:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
Oh, that's awesome!


[08/11/2021 1:55 AM] bk#4411
Yoroi is just a UI window into the blockchain.


[08/11/2021 6:51 AM] Stef#0241
Wait so there are transaction fees on the ergo Blockchain? I suppose those are paid to miners? I thought there was only the block reward since it's still high at 67.5 erg


[08/11/2021 7:15 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Yes there are transaction fees


[08/11/2021 1:28 PM] Michawl_#2646
The transaction fees are added into the block reward, this makes it so that when all coins are mined there is still an incentive to keep mining


[08/11/2021 2:21 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
A number of us have had an issue with yoroi when sending multiple token transactions one after another, only one will actually send, the rest just disappear, they don't appear in yoroi or the explorer. Do we need to wait for another block to be mined between sending each token?


[08/11/2021 2:47 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
can you link a transaction?


[08/11/2021 5:36 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
No thats the issue, they dont ever get created, you go through the process of clicking send, putting in password and it says transaction complete, go to transaction list, but it just never happens!


[08/11/2021 5:36 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
It's happened to me personally 3 times, a few other guys have been having the same issue!


[08/11/2021 5:39 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
I've tried another test, I did 4 sequential sends, to 2 different addresses both with test tokens, I will see if they appear or dont appear and post the results here!


[08/11/2021 5:41 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Ah okay. The Android app has a similar problem, maybe that's what you experience: As long as the transaction is not commited, issueing a new one is successful but the transaction disappears. That's because the same input boxes are selected, which makes the transaction invalid for the node. Wait some time between sending stuff.


[08/11/2021 5:42 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
Ok, is there anyway to get multiple inputs when they are different tokens into a box? Thanks for the response! üòÑ


[08/12/2021 5:35 AM] phenphen#2045
hey guys, can i use yoroi wallet address for ergo mining (i saw new addresses are generated automatically once after used for transaction)


[08/12/2021 6:11 AM] andee#4722
yes. all addresses that you generate can be viewed under the 'Receive' tab


[08/12/2021 6:45 AM] Stef#0241
Yeah of course but are they already active now?


[08/12/2021 9:43 AM] andee#4722
why wouldn't they be? if there were no transaction fees it would be free to spam the network


[08/12/2021 12:45 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
Yoroi doesn't automatically generate a new address you need to use after every transaction, you can use the same address for every transaction, but you also have a list of generated addresses you can also use.


[08/12/2021 4:41 PM] Lidney#5584
Unfortunately cant see my ergs in yoroi app for androids( are you guys gonna deal with it this year? (Its not gonna affect my belief in ergo....just in case)

Yoroi has been repeatedly crashing on me this week.
I was under the impression it updated automaticly. do I need to update it manually?


[08/15/2021 12:54 AM] Steve Lockhart#5327
@Sebastien  when you get a chance can you answer this for me? üëÜ


[08/15/2021 12:56 AM] Sebastien#0653
should be updated automatically unless you turned automatic updates off in your browser settings


[08/15/2021 12:57 AM] Steve Lockhart#5327
in chrome settings?


[08/15/2021 1:07 AM] Sebastien#0653
I don't remember the settings off the top of my head. It should be automatic unless you went out of your way to disable it though


[08/15/2021 1:21 AM] Steve Lockhart#5327
ok, i didnt do that. but it sure has been crashing a lot. üëÄ


[08/15/2021 1:22 AM] Sebastien#0653
yeah probably due to out of memory
especially if you mine on Ergo, you have a lot of transactions with hundreds of addresses and Yoroi wasn't really optimized for that case. There are things they can do to improve it but I don't know if they've spent time on it (I left EMURGO a few months ago)

[08/15/2021 1:27 AM] Sebastien#0653
it's not your computer's memory that's the problem -- it's the memory Chrome allocates to the specific tab that runs out


[08/15/2021 1:27 AM] Steve Lockhart#5327
ok, thanks for your help!

I don't believe so - I'll have them check


[08/26/2021 1:46 AM] egorishek#5517
they'd search the new (restored) wallet address correct?

ok there are zero transactions


[08/26/2021 1:56 AM] andee#4722
double and triple check the seed. the mind can play tricks when reading it


[08/26/2021 1:57 AM] egorishek#5517
are you talking about the 15 word seed?


[08/26/2021 1:57 AM] egorishek#5517
to restore the wallet?


[08/26/2021 1:57 AM] andee#4722
yes


[08/26/2021 1:58 AM] egorishek#5517
ok he states he has tripled checked it. And also tried restoring putting the seed words out of order and it didn't work.


[08/26/2021 1:59 AM] egorishek#5517
so he's confident he has done it right

same thing could have happened when writing it down


[08/26/2021 2:00 AM] egorishek#5517
if you have a word slightly off will it create a new wallet anyway?


[08/26/2021 2:00 AM] egorishek#5517
when going through the restoring steps?


[08/26/2021 2:01 AM] andee#4722
as long as the checksum is ok, the wallet isn't created and stored somewhere. its cryptography


[08/26/2021 2:02 AM] andee#4722
all wallets already exists, you just need the key to unlock it (the mnemonic)

but there's just no erg


[08/26/2021 2:34 AM] andee#4722
then he has to double check the receive address with the transaction from where he got sent erg


[08/26/2021 2:51 AM] egorishek#5517
he found the address with the transaction via explorer but it is different than the restored wallet address

withdraw from exchange to yoroi wallet can be traced

and seen within explorer but when trying to restore wallet it seems it's unlocking another wallet address?

was the wallet created using yoroi?

I have a problem with Yoroi showing only part of my SigRSV holdings say 1,100 in the select asset drop down box; ergo explorer reveals there's a actually larger balance of 11,100 on the same address. Sending an additional 1,000 increases Yoroi SigRSV balance to 2,100 and Ergo explorer shows 12,100.
Oddly there's an asset I have no idea about called OUROBOROS OMEGA listed under Select asset.

I have resynced the wallet along with removed and restored it...but to no avail. Anyone know how I can fix this & regain access to these inaccessible SigRSV?


[09/01/2021 7:25 AM] glasgowm#9381
Try sending all assets to one address. If not you'll need to restore to Node.

The omega token looks like someone spammed you with a nft or something

Morning all, I have been testing the ergodex with Yoroi nightly. Transferred some ergo into sigRSV, then deposited the sigRSV+erg into the dex. I think the deposit transaction was rolled back. When I check in my Yoroi wallet all my transactions are marked as failed (even prior transactions due to mining). Checking the Yoroi logs I see the attached stacktrace.

Seems like I‚Äôve run into a bug that has happened as a result of depositing sigRSV/ERG into the Ergodex. The wallet is basically unusable in Yoroi at the moment because it keeps throwing that error and showing all transactions as failed/balance as 0.

Hello, I have Yoroi extension for ERGO since January and I have some Ergo there since the creation of Wallet (january this year).
When I try to open by Extension (tried on Google and Firefox and another computer with linux) , I can see a YOROI logo, loading components.... then it's blank with the LOGO only. It doesn't load the wallet... WHY ?

I created a new wallet 5 days ago, and it load fast. It seems an issue with old wallet.

Try to press CTRL + F5 to force cache refresh


[10/14/2021 12:50 PM] anon_br#2282
Be very cautious on restoring your wallet on your current computer, on brazilian channels there are reports of viruses that breaks the Yoroi extension just to force you to try to restore your wallets from the mnemonics to stolen it from you through keylogging.


[10/14/2021 12:50 PM] anon_br#2282
Try to restore it in a fresh computer


[10/15/2021 5:16 AM] Vendetta#4016
Mobile support when?


[10/16/2021 6:14 AM] Radioactive#7078
its like that on older wallets , a trick to it is just leave it on the main screen and wait to fully initialise


[10/17/2021 11:03 PM] techinez#1860
I installed Yoroi Wallet from microsoft store  on Microsoft Edge (i don't use this browser regulary) and I was able to send funds to another new wallet with some glitches, because it's like older wallets. On new yoroi wallet it's working fine and fast now.

ouch, I have Ubuntu aswell, used mostly, I have the same problem with older wallet as windows.


[10/17/2021 11:06 PM] Gytis#3049
whats the problem?


[10/17/2021 11:06 PM] Gytis#3049
oh, i see


[10/17/2021 11:07 PM] Gytis#3049
yoroi seems to work fine for me


[10/17/2021 11:07 PM] techinez#1860
when opening the wallet, it takes a long time to open, or don't open after a long time.


[10/17/2021 11:07 PM] Gytis#3049
never encountered any issues


[10/17/2021 11:07 PM] techinez#1860
now is fine.


[10/17/2021 11:07 PM] techinez#1860
with new wallet.


[10/18/2021 8:25 AM] glasgowm#9381
If you're a miner with hundreds/thousands of transactions - yoroi can become laggy with miner dust.

yeah but yoroi is a huge gateway from cardano to ergo - if people stop using yoroi then ergo loses a ton of exposure


[10/21/2021 2:58 PM] danandbeard#2312
I feel like a few UX tweaks would solve half of yoroi issues - like when you click a wallet and it tries to sync the balance but something fails so it displays all transactions as failed and balance as zero until a successful sync?  I have to imagine that's terrifying for new users


[10/21/2021 7:29 PM] gilgaMesh#8262
have experienced that 0 balance thing when was new into erg, oh boy it was scary lol

I observed the dev team is working on ERG Ledger support. From my reading of the chat transcript, they are in the alpha testing phase.  

Is there an expected delivery of this support to the public or is it a moving target **?**


[10/27/2021 10:43 AM] vingallo22#2115
is it possible to swap between ergo and ada with yoroi?


[10/27/2021 10:58 AM] Gytis#3049
it is not an exchange, so that would be no


[10/27/2021 11:00 AM] vingallo22#2115
Yes indeed, it is a wallet, my question was if it provided swap functionality between the two coins it supports ? Despite it being "not an exchange" the website shows that is offers the ability to buy, functioning as an onramp, so does it allow swaps ?


[10/27/2021 11:12 AM] Gytis#3049
not that im aware of


[10/28/2021 3:43 AM] cyrusliu#9668
Hi everyone, I created my wallet from android device, now I want to access it on my browser extension,found out there is a word in the recovery phrase that doesn't exist or not an option in Yoroi web extension, what's wrong? 

Now I'm concerned since I'm afraid login out from my mobile, and won't be able to recover the wallet.


[10/28/2021 4:11 AM] cyrusliu#9668
My typo, never mind...


[10/28/2021 3:45 PM] Caramel#5218
Yoroi running super sluggish with just 49 transactions. To the point where its hanging in firefox and asks if i want to close the page. Any advice for better performance?

You can try to resync your wallet at `Settings > Wallet > Resync`

[11/01/2021 2:39 AM] Kazi R#9094
Same; I was trying to see if celsius network could list ERG, but seems like the community dictates what coin is listed


[11/03/2021 5:56 AM] Funky Homosapien#9611
Mine went through pretty easy.  Is the other end of the transaction going to a Yoroi wallet as well?


[11/04/2021 4:27 AM] Dv#3650
is it normal


[11/04/2021 4:28 AM] Dv#3650
for yoroi to log out of my wallet all the time? getting tried of restoring my wallet every few days...


[11/04/2021 9:23 AM] andee#4722
that is not normal


[11/04/2021 9:24 AM] andee#4722
do you use any addons that delete everything from your browser session when you close it?

Nope


[11/04/2021 10:24 AM] Dv#3650
Wish the android wallet had an export option


[11/04/2021 10:24 AM] Dv#3650
Only reason I ever use yoroi and it takes literal years to load


[11/04/2021 10:25 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
export for what?


[11/04/2021 11:11 AM] Dv#3650
Transactions to csv


[11/04/2021 11:12 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I see. Would you open an issue on GitHub describing the content of the CSV?


[11/04/2021 11:13 AM] Dv#3650
For yoroi?


[11/04/2021 11:13 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
No for the Android wallet. As a feature request


[11/04/2021 11:13 AM] Dv#3650
Ohh okay


[11/04/2021 11:27 AM] andee#4722
check for viruses or track the files yoroi store to see what is happening. there was talk about a virus that deleted yoroi wallets to force people to restore from mnemonic a while ago


[11/06/2021 11:29 PM] Doomelf#7740
Yoroi is running really slow and been having issues lately


[11/06/2021 11:31 PM] Doomelf#7740
cant even move ERG around rip


[11/06/2021 11:32 PM] Doomelf#7740
finally loads and gets stuck on calculating fees


[11/07/2021 9:33 AM] andee#4722
@Doomelf received a lot of small transactions? does it calculate faster if you input 1ERG instead of 30?


[11/07/2021 5:39 PM] Doomelf#7740
There was 1400 transactions on that wallet but it also was lagging out my other wallets too. Wondering if i should only be using 1 Yoroi per computer if that will fix it


[11/07/2021 5:40 PM] Doomelf#7740
Took 3 hours to send a few hundred ERG


[11/07/2021 5:44 PM] Doomelf#7740
Never had issues with Yoroi before until yesterday. Was very frustrating to deal with


[11/07/2021 5:44 PM] Doomelf#7740
Going to try and see if things go smoother today

if you send your wallet balance to yourself once in a while it might reduce the problem

Since the DEX discord seems somewhat inactive, I just wanted to mention here that the Yoroi wallet severely hinders the DEX user experience. Since the DEX uses the data given by the wallet many 'bugs' are simply Yoroi not reporting wallet data correctly due to constantly being incorrectly sync or not up to date. The assets tab is also displaying incorrect token names/ not showing some assets. Im not sure where the best place is to report these issues, so just writing a note here.


[11/11/2021 2:02 PM] glasgowm#9381
Should be out of beta in a few weeks - I've not had any issues apart from having to refresh yoroi but yeh it's a pain


[11/11/2021 2:05 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Yeah, the refreshing is annoying, also some specific things: 
The Wt_erg_Wt_Ada LP and Erdoge_Kushti Lp have been incorrectly named/ not recognised in assets.
The view pending tx link does not work (which is likely due to Yoroi not reporting txid)


[11/11/2021 2:07 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Keen to see the shiny out of Beta Yoroi though üôÇ


[11/11/2021 5:06 PM] edenberry#3212
I am experiencing the same problems with the Yoroi wallet.  Transaction refreshes take a long time and I cannot interact with the new dex because the wallet does not present my assets properly.  Trying to setup liquidity tells me I do not have enough assets to setup the contract.  I am usuing yoroi nightly wallet.


[11/11/2021 5:06 PM] edenberry#3212
I can connect to the SigmaUSD app and my assets are shown correctly.


[11/11/2021 11:01 PM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Also Erdoge_Kushti LP going missing in assets tab in Yoroi means liquidity providers cannot remove their Erdoge_Kushti liquidity


[11/11/2021 11:04 PM] glasgowm#9381
where is the best place to open issues for nightly @anon_br ? yoroi-frontend repo?


[11/11/2021 11:58 PM] anon_br#2282
yeah, that is the right place. But this isn't a Yoroi issue actually, the WR_ERG/WT_ADA LP (and Erdoge/kushti I suppose) token doesn't provide a verbose name in the R4 register like described in EIP4 (https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/blob/master/eip-0004.md), this is the reason that this toke appears named like "-" in Yoroi. But this doesn't represent a problem to to remove ErgoDEX liquidity at all, once the token id is used to do so, not the verbose name.


[11/12/2021 12:12 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
WR_ERG/WT_ADA LP is fine (just a name issue, which is fair enough if it isnt following EIP4), however Erdoge/kushti LP does not appear in Yoroi Nightly and is not appearing in the DEX because Yoroi is not reporting the existence of the token.


[11/12/2021 12:13 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
This token ID which the explorer reports is not appearing in Yoroi

Which is the Erdoge/Kushti LP


[11/12/2021 12:14 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
A thing to note, was that it was appearing in Yoroi about 15 hours ago, under the wrong name WR_ERG/WT_ADA _2 LP or something like that


[11/12/2021 1:24 AM] anon_br#2282
Hmm, I see. Did you tried to resync your wallet?


[11/12/2021 1:24 AM] edenberry#3212
Is the slow yoroi response a known issue?  It was fine until about 200 transactions loaded, then it got really slow and times out a lot


[11/12/2021 1:25 AM] edenberry#3212
Cant use the dex because the wallet never responds to the Dex for the approval


[11/12/2021 1:25 AM] edenberry#3212
Using nightly with dapp installed on chrome


[11/12/2021 2:35 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Yeah resynced multiple times (through setting hard resync)

Ok, can you send DM your Yoroi logs?


[11/12/2021 11:41 AM] anon_br#2282
Hi, I'm investigating this issue, can you please send me HAR logs?

Here is an instruction on how the file can be saved in Chrome: https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/10358597?hl=en

NOTE:

  1. No secret private information is ever transferred over network in Yoroi, so network logs only contain your addresses and responses from server about the state of your addresses, e.g. txs and utxos.
  2. In order for the HAR log to capture the error you need to:
    - Open Yoroi
    - Open browser devtools and open the Network tab in the tools
    - Wait for some time for the error to occur in the background - it might be visible in the network tab as red entries - or alterantively you can reload the Yoroi page and open the wallet again, while devtools are open, to force the resync.
    - Then click download in the devtools to export the HAR file
  3. You can send the HAR logs directly to me via DM or email sigmanon@protonmail.com to not have it attached to a public issue here on GitHub

Ill try, my wallet doesn't load anymore.  So people move from wallet to wallet after 100 transacations or so?


[11/13/2021 6:57 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Its not the transaction count, its the number of UTXOs you have created.


[11/13/2021 8:59 AM] andee#4722
no moving of wallets, just send your wallet balance to yourself. and increasing payout limit on pool if very much recommended


[11/13/2021 9:01 AM] andee#4722
do a search on "consolidate utxo", not consolidating them while using a hardware wallet can result in not being able to sign transactions because of their size

[11/15/2021 3:58 PM] Apextheory#6577
An update to this. I sent all funds + tokens back to myself to consolidate the UTXO's in a single address.  Yoroi is still showing different address balance than Explorer


[11/15/2021 4:03 PM] glasgowm#9381 (pinned)
Here is an instruction on how the file can be saved in Chrome: https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/10358597?hl=en

NOTE:

  1. No secret private information is ever transferred over network in Yoroi, so network logs only contain your addresses and responses from server about the state of your addresses, e.g. txs and utxos.
  2. In order for the HAR log to capture the error you need to:
    - Open Yoroi
    - Open browser devtools and open the Network tab in the tools
    - Wait for some time for the error to occur in the background - it might be visible in the network tab as red entries - or alterantively you can reload the Yoroi page and open the wallet again, while devtools are open, to force the resync.
    - Then click download in the devtools to export the HAR file
  3. You can send the HAR logs directly to me via DM or email sigmanon@protonmail.com to not have it attached to a public issue here on GitHub

[11/17/2021 12:23 AM] homesizzle#4097
I'm using yoroi on chrome and every few seconds the transactions change from high to failed. It shows my balance and then a few seconds later, the balance goes to zero. Few seconds later balance comes back. repeat. I've resynced the wallet multiple times. Same problem.


[11/17/2021 12:24 AM] homesizzle#4097
Not a good look for the coin


[11/17/2021 3:03 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
Does your balance show up on ergo block explorer ?


[11/17/2021 3:41 AM] torchTheMall#9228
im assuming everyone asks this or im an idiot - where do I get the nightly channel for yoroi


[11/17/2021 3:51 AM] torchTheMall#9228
nevermind - the only link i could find to it was on ergodex - thanks


[11/17/2021 2:40 PM] anon_br#2282
You can solve this by resyncing you wallet `Settings > Wallet > Resync`


[11/17/2021 10:36 PM] Rob3#6008
Does anyone know if there is a. Issue with running Yoroi Nightly on a Mac? I was able to use the Auction House and ErgoDex yesterday on my PC without any issue. I bought a new iMac and set it up today. However, the transactions won‚Äôt go through on either Dapp.


[11/18/2021 12:07 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Settings > Wallet > Resync, if you havent already tried. I had a similar issue when there are multiple devices using the same wallet it seems to break things. I ended up fixing by using the android wallet


[11/18/2021 12:09 AM] mix#6733
What is yoroi website??


[11/18/2021 8:09 AM] andee#4722
Make sure that yoroi is open then reload the page that uses dApp connector


[11/18/2021 8:10 AM] andee#4722
if you are using brave you also have to give permission to access the connector every time


[11/18/2021 8:58 AM] glasgowm#9381
No issues here


[11/18/2021 9:21 AM] homesizzle#4097
Tried that multiple times. This is a problem. Many people report the same thing on Reddit.

can you use yoroi nightly and dapp connector on a testnet?


[11/22/2021 4:34 PM] NoQuieroNiPensar#1308
Yes, it have been created for that


[11/22/2021 4:34 PM] torchTheMall#9228
I couldn't figure out how to change networks


[11/22/2021 4:35 PM] torchTheMall#9228
I'm new to useing ergo test net so I'm probably doing it wrong


[11/22/2021 4:35 PM] torchTheMall#9228
Perhaps it's not like eth/polygon/etc.  Now I can just run ganache and use a local blockchain

[11/23/2021 6:24 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
You may want to restore your wallet on android wallet if you can. Then send your funds to a new adress


[11/23/2021 6:31 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Unfortunately only have an iOS. Worst case I can use a node wallet or even code a transaction but I'd rather just get the wallet fixed.


[11/23/2021 10:10 AM] glasgowm#9381
@anon_br is the dev, but there's a beta for the iOS if that's easier.


[11/23/2021 10:11 AM] glasgowm#9381

Same for other miners using Yoroi on Firefox?


[11/27/2021 11:47 AM] andee#4722
having lots of small payouts is not recommended on UTxO chains, and depending on where you are located it can create a lot of extra work for tax documentation


[11/27/2021 11:47 AM] andee#4722
try consolidating your wallet by sending your wallet balance to yourself

It can happen with too many transactions - use the 'send all' feature to collect all your UTXOs


[11/28/2021 8:09 PM] HelixEvo#2120

yoroi nightly is the beta version.

Yeah same, showing a lot of incorrect balances and syncing doesn't do the job, incorrect balance and such.

Do you have lots of txs?


[12/01/2021 7:25 PM] LeggoMyErgo#4477
yes...I think I found a solution, after resyncing and generating addresses not working, I just sent 0.5 Erg to a new address. appears correct now. I'll try sending again as that was the issue (failed txs now not visible).


[12/01/2021 7:25 PM] anon_br#2282

[12/03/2021 11:44 AM] Pgr456#1839
@anon_br  Managed to brake a yoroi wallet too on nightly and on stable. Does the yoroi backend some caching because even if I restore from scratch I am getting the exact same messed up state? If it helps debugging I should have around 100 transactions (wallet shows 53) and my derivation path says I have generated 141 addresses (that should be the correct value). Interestingly it shows the wrong balance (ERG and assets) even for the first address in the derivation path


[12/03/2021 7:08 PM] Doomelf#7740
seems to be an issue happening to alot of people recently. I've broken a few wallets hoping it gets fixed soon so i can get them into a fresh new wallet. Maybe try the android wallet. I hear it could take up to 2 weeks for emurgo to fix this issue...

[12/06/2021 1:22 PM] PloppyTheJailer#4041
I'm not sure if you know the answer to this


[12/06/2021 1:23 PM] PloppyTheJailer#4041
Each time I've deposited ADA into Yoroi I've had to use a new address


[12/06/2021 1:24 PM] PloppyTheJailer#4041
And I'm assuming this is correct because it says "To protect your privacy, new addresses are generated automatically once you use them"


[12/06/2021 1:24 PM] PloppyTheJailer#4041
But this hasn't been the case with ERG


[12/06/2021 1:25 PM] PloppyTheJailer#4041
I've used the same Yoroi address for 5 transactions now and a new one hasn't been generated


[12/06/2021 1:27 PM] PloppyTheJailer#4041
@anon_br Do you know anything about this?


[12/06/2021 1:28 PM] PloppyTheJailer#4041
I'm just kind of confused because new Yoroi addresses have been generated automatically for ADA but not for ERG after they have been used


[12/06/2021 1:39 PM] glasgowm#9381
think doing that is more problematic on PoW - you can generate addresses if you needed each time but not always needed

[12/06/2021 1:43 PM] PloppyTheJailer#4041
@glasgowm Yeah, what I'm saying is that new addresses have been generated automatically with my ADA wallet but not with ERG


[12/06/2021 1:44 PM] glasgowm#9381
oh right sorry, never noticed - will just be using the same UI elements as the ada one

I mine to a yoroi wallet. I use firefox. Wallet constantly crashes before it can sync? Cant load/display correct balance either. It gets worse with every transaction.  Wallet is not useable. Erg is stuck. Any fix?

a password that you set when you created the wallet


[12/10/2021 2:56 PM] wileyyy#7785
Yeah it's the same seed. Ergo explorer shows the same as my Android wallet as well. Hasn't synced in a week.


[12/10/2021 8:22 PM] alexandru#0679
yes, you are lucky, mine is not even loading :)))


[12/10/2021 8:25 PM] wileyyy#7785
My yoroi nightly shows the correct amount and syncs properly, but also I use brave so it won't connect to anything right now while their trying to fix a bug or something. Whole thing is goofed up rn


[12/11/2021 9:58 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
When Yoroi shows more chances are high you have some amount on a derived address that you didn't add to Android yet


[12/11/2021 2:25 PM] wileyyy#7785
Yoroi shows less actually. Hasn't shown any transactions since 12/5


[12/14/2021 8:12 AM] Dv#3650
is there anyway to make yoroi not freeze/take 2 hours to load?


[12/14/2021 10:59 AM] Dv#3650
Man it's so frustrating, guess I'll let it load over night, god damn

[12/14/2021 8:02 PM] alexandru#0679
yes but if you have to many UTXOs you should wait for an update because it's not  fully functional right now. I sugges you to use the mobile app


[12/14/2021 8:02 PM] alexandru#0679

alright thanks!!


[12/15/2021 2:46 AM] Dv#3650
Defeats the purpose of the wallet for me then. Only reason I use yoroi is for the transaction export feature for tax purposes. If I send all of them to another wallet my cost basis won't be correct once I import them.


[12/15/2021 5:05 AM] Dv#3650
yea does the node have transaction export feature though? That's literally all I need atm

[12/26/2021 10:22 PM] andee#4722
Ergo's official wallet is the node, not Yoroi. Did you receive lots of small transactions by any chance? I have seen some minor slowdowns, but the wallet has never been non functional


[12/27/2021 12:48 AM] coolbrown#9003
It just crashes all the time. So much difficult to do anything. Plus not many wallets such trustwallet, zelcore, etc wallets supports ERG which make it harder for transactions.


[12/27/2021 8:26 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
as said, yoroi is not made from the team. you can use the node on desktop or our mobile wallets, these are made from the team. personally, looking at the comments I wonder why everyone complains about yoroi but sticks to it instead of choosing to use another wallet. makes no sense to me.


[12/27/2021 11:13 AM] blackinsecure#3693
probably the convenience of having everything  related to ADA and ERG in one wallet + not wanting to transfer all funds back and forth every time something goes wrong with one platform


[12/27/2021 11:14 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
no need to transfer anything, just restore your wallet

Mine is unfunctional after just 280~ ish transactions...


[12/27/2021 7:51 PM] Dv#3650
From my understanding yoroi is the only wallet that support transaction exports... Kinda forced to use it to calculate taxes/cost basis for mining.


[12/27/2021 7:52 PM] Dv#3650
Agreed


[12/27/2021 7:55 PM] andee#4722
If you get a lot of small mining payouts you should consolidate once in a while, while a desktop app should handle stuff like this a hardware wallet would also be unable to sign a transaction with too many inputs


[12/27/2021 8:08 PM] Dv#3650
That doesn't really help me with book keeping


[12/27/2021 8:12 PM] andee#4722
Pools usually support exporting as CSV or have API calls to get payout data


[12/27/2021 8:24 PM] Dv#3650
Don't believe herominers or nano have that, which are the two I've been using so


[12/27/2021 8:41 PM] andee#4722
It is possible to get payout data from both, but its in JSON. A small python script and the tax work can be fully automated


[12/27/2021 8:42 PM] andee#4722
Anyways, I just wanted to tell you about consolidating since that actually keeps the wallet functional.

[12/28/2021 2:35 AM] Dv#3650
Although possible, it seems a lot of these "small" issues compound, creating a frustrating experience for users, especially new users. I'd say most people choose yoroi over the node because of its simplicity. Although it has bugs which cause it to break completely. And I'll acknowledge that I'm just bitching atm since I'm not able to create or fix the current issues, but regardless it's frustrating non the less.


[12/28/2021 2:36 AM] Dv#3650
Are there any tutorials for this or any where you could point me? Looks like this will be the only way I'll be able to get the transaction info. Unless yoroi is patched within the next week

You can just recover your wallet on mobile


[12/29/2021 8:51 AM] andee#4722
Where in the process does it fail? If you have 120 1ERG mining payouts in the wallet, try sending less at a time


[12/29/2021 8:54 AM] andee#4722
To fully automate it would require some basic python tutorials. I can probably help you with a script to get data from the pools as CSV so you can import it to a spreadsheet


[12/29/2021 9:41 PM] Venom T 10#8384
It takes a couple hours to fully load my balance and everytime I click to go to a different menu it takes about 10 minutes to load, but yea I did change the payout to higher so maybe it‚Äôll fix from here on out
