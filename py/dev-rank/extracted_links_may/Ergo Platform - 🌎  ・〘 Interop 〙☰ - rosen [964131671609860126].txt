Dev Update March 29 | ROSEN BRIDGE | New Bridge Framework Explained
Ergo Business Manager Joseph Armeanio talks us though the new bridge framework - Rosen Bridge. In this first video in the new series of Dev Updates, Armeanio goes into more detail on a single 'core' feature of ergo. We hope you like it and find it educational. Let us know your feedback in the comments!

Nathan Rosen
Nathan Rosen (Hebrew: ◊†◊™◊ü ◊®◊ï◊ñ◊ü; March 22, 1909 ‚Äì December 18, 1995) was an American-Israeli physicist noted for his study on the structure of the hydrogen atom and his work with Albert Einstein and Boris Podolsky on entangled wave functions and the EPR paradox. The Einstein‚ÄìRosen bridge, later named the wormhole, was a theory of Nathan Rosen.

Rosen have it's own discord or telegram? Where y'all at? I was thinking of trying to build a guard or watcher - didn't know if you guys have an effective one of either yet as example to help me make sure I understand correctly the concepts

When will the first bridge based on rosen go live?


[06/17/2022 5:08 PM] NoahErgo#4349
From june 15th:

On Rosen we are about 2-3 weeks behind our planned schedule. The bridge development needs to be very meticulous.
- implementation of unit tests took much more time than anticipated, however now almost all necessary parts of the system have unit tests.
- based on the initial tests, also, we found a few bugs and issues in txn creation on Ergo and Cardano side which took another week to be resolved.
- it will be on testnets in less than a month

Rosen Bridge:
- finally the bridge is working smoothly under a lot of txns per minute on both side. 
- During the stress test we discovered a few race conditions and bottlenecks. Almost all of them are resolved currently.
- We'll let the bridge work under pressure for a few days.

- We almost minimized the use of Koios due to its bugs, latency, and being out-of-sync issues, and now we mostly use Ogmios. However, it is important for us to have multiple channels, so we'll keep it in the code for a while till a better option is available.
- first draft of tokenomics is ready and I'm working with a few experts to finalize it.

The Rosen design allows for transfer between any 2 supported chains.

Ergo, Cardano, Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum, etc. 

2022 saw bridges fail because they were poorly made and overmarketed.

It is time for a new standard. Built on clear assumptions. @Ergo_Platform

Who are going to be the watchers for rosen?


[04/06/2023 5:14 PM] glasgowm#9381
> Each chain has its own set of watchers, so we have Ergo watchers and Cardano watchers now. Being a watcher is as easy as running the watcher code and then you need some reporting permits. With a reporting permit you are allowed to report one event from the chain you're watching. If the report is finalized, your permit token will be returned to you and you can use it again. In order to report more events simultaneously you can obtain more reporting permits. Reporting permits can be obtained by locking Rosen's token. reporting is a two step process, first you commit to the event, then a watcher will report and reveal the related commitments when enough commitments are there. This will force each watcher to report itself not by viewing other reports and replaying them.

more interesting question is who are the guards


[04/09/2023 1:53 PM] janerik#7676
As the focus if Rosen will be on security rather then speed, I would be interested in what magnitude we should expect for transfer times.  Should we expect seconds, minutes, hours or even days? Also how well is Rosen expected to scale with the number of transactions?


[04/09/2023 5:13 PM] blackinsecure#3693

Probably @mhs_sam and team? or maybe some Ergonauts, who knows üòÖ    i'm assuming the devs would probably want to be first guards to get logs etc during testing phase.
