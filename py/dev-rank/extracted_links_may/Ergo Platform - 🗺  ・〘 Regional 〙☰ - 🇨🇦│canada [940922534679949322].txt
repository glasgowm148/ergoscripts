Guess you mine if you reach this limit


[08/18/2022 6:31 PM] wombo22#5461
This limit seems to affect bitbuy and Newton as far as I‚Äôm aware

Hello, I'm confident with ergo futur. This project needs more traction and more projects build on it.

Since we are in canada, I collect people's bottles and split evenly between all dontaors of cans and my self and who help and Invest in ergo. I can see it being quite laughable for the effort put in the future. Do reccomend.


[09/15/2022 6:07 PM] vexorg#0768
Is there anywhere in Canada where we can buy/sell ergo directly?


[09/16/2022 1:42 AM] Young Wolf#9877
I think changelly

Federal loans maybe be interest free so this may interest some people

#Ergonauts, are you frustrated at the thought of doing taxes? Here's a quick video explaining how to edit spreadsheets from SAFEW so you can upload them to Koinly: https://t.co/2nnYHEmkp9

lui also making something on his spare time


[02/18/2023 12:26 PM] wombo22#5461
if you have time you can also possibly use yoroi to get an excel export but not sure if its still working since yoroi is losing ergo support


[03/31/2023 8:11 PM] asspects#3609

Is Biconomy known in canada?


[04/06/2023 11:17 PM] wombo22#5461
@rustinmyeye would you know ^?


[04/07/2023 12:09 AM] rustinmyeye#3722
Nah I‚Äôm not super crypto savvy‚Ä¶ never heard of Biconomy either. I am 100% only in ergo, but I‚Äôm not an active erg buyer, only mining and holding what I‚Äôve already swapped. I‚Äôve used TradeOgre and KuCoin in the past for that.


[04/23/2023 3:58 AM] onins#1276
Hey there, what I usually do is deposit fiat to Coinsmart then I will buy ADA and send ADA to Coinex. ADA/ERG swap feature on Coinex does the trick.


[04/23/2023 4:00 AM] onins#1276
Somehow I am having difficulty in fiat deposits on Kucoin so it is kind of a long process to get ERG. üòÖ
