Welcome @Sigmanauts ! You are the founding 20 members who will help grow and shape Ergo :ergo_orange: üéâ

This space is shared between the sigmanauts, core devs and ergo foundation. Most of you should already know each other - the people who were helping out with moderation, etc previously have automatically been added to this role. 

The base of the onboarding document is setup now so please have a read through and try and get a feel for what this project is all about.

https://sideways-stove-8c5.notion.site/Sigmanauts-Onboarding-08e8577d5f0b420fae04d496522f8fb2

The first tasks, if anyone wants to help out/take some on.

- Flesh out the onboarding doc. Still a lot of work needed around our voice/community culture
- Critique any points / structures / etc - everything is up for debate and this is just an initial draft. 
- Figure out how to issue a ton of these neat NFTs (from @Foeniculum ) and maybe imprint a badge number
- Formalising an incentives structure
- Defining some common tasks and goals anyone can tackle. 

Once we're agreed on this (hopefully in the next few days) I can bring in the first round on sigmanaut candidates (SIGCANs).

Initially they will have access to all channels under this category apart from this one and #üó£‚îÇvote which will be used to bring the SIGCANs into the Sigmanaut role once they've earned their stripes.

Leaning towards having an additional committee layer above the sigmanauts which I invite you all to join. This committee would help guide the sigmanauts, settle any conflicts and is of course - open to expansion via vote. 

This would be after some time, on the timeframe of months, rather than weeks I'd expect for the sigmanaut role - as I'm currently envisioning).  Although may be simpler just to have Sigmanauts as the highest role. Feedback here is also appreciated.

@glasgowm is there a invite you can send out for notion ? I can help with the development of the onboarding pages


[12/16/2021 5:57 PM] glasgowm#9381
It's not really divided up yet or permission off - but you should be able to edit using that link? I tested it in private mode on a seperate account and it worked for me.

Make that 21 - added in @NoahErgo which many of you know from the tg chats. May be one or two more (Snowman? T$?) which didn't get the original invite due to privacy settings. Assume it's fine me just adding them. 

Try and funnel more discussions into here and out of DMs and the OGs chat when possible so we can keep everything out in open.

Something I feel strongly about if we are going to be doing this is to encourage intellectual honesty and self critique with where Ergo is at. No need to pretend we are hot shit when there is still work to be done. Let's create and encourage a culture of identifying key areas that need growth and find solutions to solve those problems. Oracle pools, nipopows, etc. and all the rest are great. Let's not kid ourselves and say we have the best tech out there when it is yet to be fully fleshed out and adopted by developers, users, other blockchains via cross chain, etc. When I found Ergo this was what was "sold" to me by the community which I think is not the best culture to encourage moving forward. People trying to convince new users that Ergo is the best because of things that are just on paper still, or that have been developed but are still rough around the edges and do not yet have real adoption.

I would love to see the community culture shift more to an honest problem solving attitude rather than a shilling attitude, and I think sigmanaut program is a great opportunity to do that. Rant over haha


[12/17/2021 10:42 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
I feel as a community we handle constructive criticism rather well. No?


[12/17/2021 10:44 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
I agree that it is key to our growth üòÑ


[12/17/2021 11:05 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
Seems to be cleared up at this stage anyway


[12/17/2021 11:06 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
Posted this on telegram but makes sense to repeat here I think. @NoahErgo is going to review but honestly I'll post the draft here and anyone can comment, it's a pretty big topic for ergo and the crypto sphere so it needs to be good.

"I'm thinking of writing an article about crosschain on ergo, if I was to write one could someone review for Grammer and accuracy? I haven't wrote anything outside a tech document in a long time so might need some pizzazz üòÇ"


[12/17/2021 11:11 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
I'd definitely add the two of them, also I propose Jos√©, he's been killing it in all ergo chats helping people.


[12/17/2021 11:34 PM] NoahErgo#4349
I think jos√© is here already


[12/17/2021 11:35 PM] NoahErgo#4349
I think so too. It was a bit ranty ill admit haha. Have just been thinking about the community marketing approach that was taken months ago and I think it somewhat backfired after creating hype around things that really werent as far along as the community made them out to be to new people


[12/17/2021 11:38 PM] NoahErgo#4349
People latched onto oracle pools really hard as what cardano would be using, and then Sigmausd as a stablecoin for cardano, and theres also been hype for ergomixer and nipopows. All of these things are great but the way this stuff was shilled to new people was a bit dishonest imo in an effort to generate hype. I was just as guilty of this as anybody else btw


[12/18/2021 12:12 AM] glasgowm#9381
One of the main arguments I hear is we actually need to spend more effort painting a picture of what the possibilities are with the tech in future.    i.e; what opportunities Wormhole opens rather than the technical features. 

I'm not really sure anyone in the know was involved much in marketing back then. A big part of the problem was lack of voice + terrible headlines which created a narrative. (With sigmausd in particular, as we'd would have had to KYC'd to issue like coti). 

Oracle pools feels more like a mismatch in expectations between Devs and retail. That fud was surprising as it'd came up the first few times Charles mentioned it and was easily dispelled. The masses that watched the summit is a different beast tho


[12/18/2021 12:16 AM] NoahErgo#4349
Good perspective, well said


[12/18/2021 12:18 AM] glasgowm#9381
I agree we should be more concrete too. But what were lacking is the visionary stuff. What happens in 10 years, why it matters

[12/18/2021 12:21 AM] NoahErgo#4349
Maybe then the approach can be: here is why this piece of tech is exciting long term, here is where it is at now, and x y z is what needs to be done to get to that vision

The Cardano expected link definitely hurt us, nothing to be done about it though, just need to try establish Ergo as it's own thing now. I don't mind people thinking we are collarorating with anyone, but to be called a Cardano project is frustrating, and it's still happening.

[12/18/2021 1:06 PM] glasgowm#9381
These were the main blocking points a couple months ago I've been working through if anyone can spot any glaring omissions.  

On the wallet front - node is slightly better, yoroi is finally almost out of beta (and dApp connector gone in a good bit of news), iOS beta is out, JVM source is out, and minotaur-wallet dApp stack/ledger on the way. So the solutions here are already so much better than the constant FUD a few months ago.

Booted up ergodocs, continuous work but getting there and I think @Crypto Cream received a grant for some privacy/mixer docs + ErgoVisual 

Structure has came along way too, comms. the main focus now with the website content + redesign which I hope the sigmanauts can assist with. Speaking to a comms. company who worked with iohk but not sure how much they can assist on this front as ergo's voice probably needs to come from within.

Sorry, took me a minute to check this space. I'll make a point of checking more often.
Hello everybody. I put an article on hold about Ergo Lend - I need Chris Ray's input and he isn't feeling well. 
Getting started on one about ErgoPad. 
Gigi (via Frosty, the Adaverse guys) offered to help flesh out a series of articles by normies for normies covering dApps being built on Ergo.
I struggle a bit with keeping the EF's IG updated. I'll try to focus more on that too.
If I have taken a tangent and went off topic to what we are supposed to be discussing here lmk.

Yeh they done their IDO and events, some branding, etc. Not sure what they'll help us with yet. Come from within meaning the people currently building on and shaping erg (whether it be code or discussions) are likely best suited to continue shaping and helping to formalise that 'voice'


[12/19/2021 12:52 PM] glasgowm#9381

We can maybe get some people to help you with IG or set up some automation?


[12/19/2021 1:03 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#1687
Sure. But all these great dev updates for instance have gone to waste because I don't know how to summarize them. So whatever/whoever you think is best. The graphs too that I made- there should be some homogeneity and I didn't accomplish that. It's all over the place. lol

You'll be voting on sigmanauts individually later, but voting on the SIGCAN cohort would be a bit tedious

[12/31/2021 3:31 AM] Chris Ray#2713
Exactly what @NoahErgo  is suggesting above, would the EF have any guidance that would assist Sigmanauts in developing actionable items that would flow well with EF efforts in the near future?


[12/31/2021 4:14 AM] Chris Ray#2713
I was just catching up on some other tabs I haven't had a chance to read and would like to propose that Sigmanauts get involved in and work on promoting  the LETS experiment that kushti and Vesci Hiisi were discussing early December


[12/31/2021 4:20 AM] Chris Ray#2713
It's possible that finding the right people to get involved in the experiment could kill two birds with one stone, take for example someone with ergoscript backend experience could work on @quokka nft project for the purpose to get front-end react work done on their own project (just example Quokka) and while exchanging work in a LETS environment they work through the experiment and get their project worked on.

TY! i'll read up on it. last I heard wasnt @glasgowm working on it? is there any other active members contributing to the project? or is it just sitting idle?


[01/02/2022 12:02 AM] NoahErgo#4349
Pretty sure just glasgows projects


[01/02/2022 12:12 AM] glasgowm#9381
#deleted-channel has the latest stuff. Not my project, I just wrote an article based on the git.


[01/02/2022 11:16 AM] glasgowm#9381
There was a guy who wrote a whitepaper #koru but he ended up building it on Holochain since they already had a feeless solution which would need to happen on L2 on erg.

But generally a pretty interesting project so don't think it'll lack dev interest for much longer. I was thinking in a seamless multi-platform app, and fool-proof setup - you could see all kinds of interesting ones pop up.

It is crazy how ergo members work together with something like an irrelevant voting, as soon as they saw  chances of getting listed on coinbase due to the voting, they all became the strongest marketing team wow

Which one? The Ergonauts one? Yeh I've got it there setup if we ever want to migrate. Easier just putting everything on one atm tho as getting people to join another Discord confuses people.

If anyone is good with Discord automation or wants to setup bots lmk üôÇ There's a neat bot that lets you add channels based on emojis but not sure if there's anything better + requires a bit of setup. Think we have too many channels defo. Wondering if we can collapse some of them into Threads.


[01/10/2022 10:14 AM] glasgowm#9381
If you mean the sig-trooper TG, not as active anymore as I took the gas off Reddit a bit as we we're getting decent organic growth.

Really strange you didn't get a bump in miners for the PoV scheme @√Ör√ñhB√™ - surprising more people don't care about that


[01/10/2022 11:22 AM] glasgowm#9381
Is there some other factor I'm missing? For the miner it's just a change in their config to switch pools right?


[01/10/2022 11:39 AM] Luivatra#9076
I think a looooot of miners do no look into what they are mining at all, just profitability


[01/10/2022 11:42 AM] glasgowm#9381
maybe I'm naive but I hope that's less than 99.5%


[01/10/2022 11:46 AM] Gazza_SP#5835
Getblok also pays well, I don't see any reason not to switch over to be honest, I expected my return to go down due to the low overall hashrate but it's been consistent even taking into account the difficulty lowering


[01/10/2022 12:08 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeh maybe that is a consideration too. Should do a poll on r/erg_miners


[01/10/2022 12:32 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Complacency as well. But yes most miners are very profit driven.  The hardest thing to convey being a small pool is the rewards balance out.   The cone from nano or hero and expect the same consistency in returns (blocks) whereas a small pool will have one good day one bad day but in the end it all balances out.   A new miner hops on our pool on a bad they they think less rewards and goes back to their beloved nanopool.

Italian community is making strides in trying to grow and spread the word. One user is building a website, another (Ergonario=Luigggi) translates pretty much anything regarding Ergo into Italian.

[01/10/2022 11:40 PM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
Exactly. Luck plays a factor but rewards balance out over time. There is a point, where the pool is so small that the time to balance or average out rewards is months or years (theoretically) so not very practical in those cases. 

For example, you and 2 friends create a pool with 300 MH/s total hashrate. 
Your pool may get extremely lucky and find a block within 24 hrs. Your pool is obviously going to payout much more than average for those 24 hrs. You could also, not find a block for 2 years and have much lower rewards than average for those 2 years lol. 

So there comes a point where luck is too big of a factor to be feasible, because you're basically solo mining with such a low "pool" hashrate. 

GetBlok is big enough that rewards should average out within days or weeks. Not months or years.

Everyone feel free to hop in here but I'm going to write a few options.
1. Ban people saying the project is dead/baseless FUD
2. Warn then ban for same scenario
3. Warn, mute for 24 hours then ban if repeated
4. Warn, mute for 24 hours, mute for 7 days, ban if repeated


[01/11/2022 12:21 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000

[01/11/2022 7:03 PM] Seedubya#0000
Mentions of dead project, rug pulling, devs left (I'm sure there are others)/which are blatant lies

asic resistant yes               no                       x
                      |
decentralized
smart pools   yes                x                             x

I will try to explain it here, lets say we pick RVN and another coin that will be up against Ergo bidding for Eth hash power and others too like SOL, we highlight all the negative things that we don't like as the reason that the other coins will be better than Ergo, for example SOL is funded by highly motivated VC backers that created a centralized chain they can turn off whenever they want to exclude bad actors from participating in the network if they wanted, RVN as a fork of bitcoin will maintain slow R&D implementations cause it was not built to scale it was built to be rigorous and sturdy which means that any new innovations won't affect miners or the ecosystem allowing users to remain in the same environment for a long time.
Or something like that, haha, would almost be fun to do (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <dann> I would like to have an infographic that compares Ergo to other PoW currencies, idk something like:
---------------Ergo ------- RVN --------- KDA
                      |
light clients    yes               no                     x
                      |
asic resistant yes               no                       x
                      |
decentralized
smart pools   yes                x                             x
                      |)

reads very well. maybe you would consider adding a little more information regarding EFYT leading up to the fork. We get lots of confusion when someone says "Zoom out the chart" so it would be great to get that information in front of the community to clarify. Even though you mention the demise of solo mining I dont think people will put 2 and 2 together unfortunately. üôÇ

I think before we hold this vote we should probably form a voting process to ensure everyone is afforded opportunity to vote or is going to accept the results of a vote they abstain from willingly or by being unaware by lack of participation, cause although we are right now coming to a consensus it is being done somewhat unorganized.


[01/12/2022 11:32 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
agreed. it would be nice to be able to open and close votes individually by topic. then we can classify what votes are active or inactive and can create a clean archiving structure for future reference if needed.

Do we have any data on Ergo's energy usage? I know it's more efficient than most PoW algos, but how do I quantity that?


[01/13/2022 1:26 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I guess my question is how many kw/hrs per GH? If those are the correct units


[01/13/2022 2:01 AM] TypoDaPsycho#0000
I would ask or poll the mining channel, maybe get a decent guesstimate . 
But each miner is going to report different ranges, because large variety of graphics cards of varying efficiency. Plus, some people undervolt their rigs to be efficient, while some really don't. (re @TIMRŒ£G7: I guess my question is how many kw/hrs per GH? If those are the correct units)


[01/13/2022 2:06 AM] Arohbe#0000
MH/sec per watt is the real measurement. Can be mh/w as well.   What @TypoDaPsycho said is true.  It‚Äôs hard to gauge as there are miners that look for efficiency and others that look for max hashrate. (re @TIMRŒ£G7: I guess my question is how many kw/hrs per GH? If those are the correct units)


[01/13/2022 2:09 AM] TypoDaPsycho#0000
Very true (re @Haskell_plus: I think before we hold this vote we should probably form a voting process to ensure everyone is afforded opportunity to vote or is going to accept the results of a vote they abstain from willingly or by being unaware by lack of participation, cause although we are right now coming to a consensus it is being done somewhat unorganized.)

Thanks, y'all. I will ask the mining channel. This came up after I suggested that our students create NFTs for a graphic design project. Someone objected bc of power consumption and I rebutted with stats from cardano, but I wished I knew what Ergo consumed to use that example instead.


[01/13/2022 4:20 AM] Arohbe#0000
This may help.   Its a spreadsheet used in the mining group that shows miners overclock settings.  It will at the very least give you a general idea of power consumption.  To determine what the total network consumes.  You will be able to get an average but would be a very wide range.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NsuoDB27EwCo_BlSjCP3GMLfTSJRPIWIBsL-wPTllUg/edit#gid=1675061291 (re @TIMRŒ£G7: Thanks, y'all.

To be honest ergo will use the same power as any other PoW, we may get more hashes per second but that means the difficulty will just increase. We just need to try get a cleaner source of energy for mining. (re @TIMRŒ£G7: Thanks, y'all. I will ask the mining channel.

[01/13/2022 5:50 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
There is no efficient way to mine realistically, no way to avoid that FUD in my eyes, but we can educate saying in a lot of places it uses excess electricity and also renewables


[01/13/2022 5:52 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
Or we need better hardware that uses less energy. (re @Gazza_ERG: To be honest ergo will use the same power as any other PoW, we may get more hashes per second but that means the difficulty will just increase. We just need to try get a cleaner source of energy for mining.)


[01/13/2022 5:54 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
Only way to get that is with ASIC's and we definitely don't want to go down that route due to centralization


[01/13/2022 5:57 AM] Arohbe#0000
Fpga as well (re @Gazza_ERG: Only way to get that is with ASIC's and we definitely don't want to go down that route due to centralization)


[01/13/2022 5:57 AM] Arohbe#0000
There are some coins such as RVN that used much more power and are hotter to run.


[01/13/2022 5:58 AM] Arohbe#0000
I always felt like eth was a bit harsher on my cards as well


[01/13/2022 5:59 AM] Arohbe#0000

[01/13/2022 6:00 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
Yeah there are differences between algorithms I guess but I couldn't say to someone with a straight face that my mining is energy efficient with 2 GPUS at 100% power usage 24 hours a day üòÖ


[01/13/2022 6:00 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
When I get a house I'll get a bunch of solar panels put in, try offset the cost of it, if I can mine with renewables I'd be much happier!


[01/13/2022 6:01 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
But I also live in Ireland so there's no sun, apparently the newest solar panels work great even here though


[01/13/2022 6:25 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I never really got the power consumption fud. It's just economics, same as every other energy source. If anything it encourages clean energy use and innovation.


[01/13/2022 6:26 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000

I'd think that ASICS would lead to more energy consumption by the mining network? 
Yes, an ASIC would provide more kH/W but then GPU miners would be pushed out because they'd struggle to compete from a profitably standpoint.
Also the upgrade cycle of ASICs is much shorter than GPUs, always chasing the newer model in an effort to keep up with this year's model. 
I have a couple Polaris cards that are 4 or 5 years old, one was previously mining Eth but taken offline in 2017 by operator that upgraded his farm. 5 years later that card is mining Erg like a champ, and (if I'm lucky) will continue to do so until 2025 when dag file goes past 4 gb. 
When ASICs become outdated, they can only be repurposed to mine another coin on the same algorithm. With GPUs you can move to easily dozens of other coins, or sell to a gamer needing a card. 
Until we're able to power PoW with 100% renewable "clean" energy, environmental impact will be used as FUD by the majority. (re @Gazza_ERG: Only way to get that is with ASIC's and we definitely don't want to go down that route due to centralization)

So over in #üó£‚îÇvote I have decided to vote üëç for all the sigcans Glasgow proposed, there is strength in numbers and maybe with more participation some structure can be introduced to the Sigmanaut side of whatever is going on here - I want to point out that we failed to come to a clear consensus on a fairly easy decision on how to mod the old degen trade chat - kind of disappointed that I wasted time on the subject just to have changes get made that was also involved in the discussion tbh, kind of like why was it even brought up?

And then also a few comments on how sigcans become a Sigmanaut, what is the structure there? Glasgow proposes someone and it goes to a vote? I am ok with it i guess, but this is me throwing in the towel just to move forward I suppose.

[01/14/2022 7:46 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
I keep thinking about those categorizations though. They are based on American culture (and economy) which has been at time extremely different to ours. We still use it though. I was told I was a Xennial (too old for GenX, too young for milennials) but beyond cultural references nothing really applies. (re @Haskell_plus: I think Jose is millenial too and just does not want to admit it, which says something.... not sure what though.)


[01/14/2022 7:46 PM] C4lculista#0000

well I‚Äôm sure those rules will be needed in the new erg trading soon enough lol
I wouldn‚Äôt put too much weight in Telegram tho the trading chat seems busy but it‚Äôs like 70 uniques per day. Reddit is 3k for comparison - twitter/yt about the same probably. Just need to make sure it doesn‚Äôt catch fire and the petrol had soaked through. (re @C4lculista: yeah, that's what we were talking about.

With the successful funding for DeCo from the raffle I have put alot of thought into incentives for growth of the ecosystem, and I think about how intimidating it can be to request for a grant from the EF, GoodWhale, or Darkfund0, so I will be starting a raffle for a Sigmanaut fund that will be aligned with the goals of the program, this fund will be used by the sigmanauts to fund ergonauts that seek an incentive for what they are building, and the fund will be subject to a majority vote by sigmanauts through discord to be spent, the idea is not to fully fund someone in their projects, but to add some encouraging incentive.
To start:
1. I believe that a petition for funds must be brought by a Sigmanaut that is sponsoring the request for funds, EF members that want to sponsor a project proposal must have one Sigmanaut in support.
2. 70% of recognized Sigmanauts in the program must be included in a üëç or üëé vote for the grant to be funded or rejected, if rejected by lack of Sigmanaut participation the request can be proposed at a later date with no changes to it.

I have given sigmanauts permissions on this Discord to edit roles lower than them, mute people, manage events, emojis - everything outside of ban/delete and server/channel management (probably safer keeping that just for dedicated moderators).

The Events feature is a good way to highlight things - I think even doing community things in this is fine tbh? i,e. ergopad AMA, SigmaValley launch - anything happening in the ecosystem.

awesome idea (re @Haskell_plus: With the successful funding for DeCo from the raffle I have put alot of thought into incentives for growth of the ecosystem, and I think about how intimidating it can be to request for a grant from the EF, GoodWhale, or Darkfund0, so I will be starting a raffle for a Sigmanaut fund that will be aligned with the goals of the program, this fund will be used by the sigmanauts to fund ergonauts that seek an incentive for what they are building, and the fund will be subject to a majority vote by sigmanauts through discord to be spent, the idea is not to fully fund someone in their projects, but to add some encouraging incentive.
To start:
1. I believe that a petition for funds must be brought by a Sigmanaut that is sponsoring the request for funds, EF members that want to sponsor a project proposal must have one Sigmanaut in support.
2. 70% of recognized Sigmanauts in the program must be included in a üëç or üëé vote for the grant to be funded or rejected, if rejected by lack of Sigmanaut participation the request can be proposed at a later date with no changes to it.)

Doesn't realize miners are in charge or what? (re @glasgowm: )


[01/16/2022 7:40 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
Ya,  cause contracts are so easy to change and stop once they are activated, haha (re @glasgowm: )


[01/16/2022 7:55 PM] Seedubya#0000
12 days ago, that was prior to releasing your articles armeanio. He seems to have changed his tune after clarifying and reiterating that the miners are running the show. 
Maybe reiterate once again it's not like ETH when the devs do what ever and the miners just wear it? 
Hopefully the message has gotten through that it's not about price action (that's just a potential byproduct) but all about the security of the protocol


[01/16/2022 7:57 PM] Seedubya#0000
He summed it up nicely in a few words something along the lines of "leaving it the way it is you will mine all the coins that are now worth nothing because in 2027 its a dead chain" 
As no unknown miner incentive afterwards

[01/17/2022 11:40 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
Is anyone using Zero Knowledge Treasury? I need a multi sig solution for Sigmafunds before running a raffle I think.


[01/17/2022 11:40 PM] glasgowm#0000
not AFAIK, anon_real is working on his DAO/collective spending tool and ErgoPad are also releasing some DAO tooling soon.


[01/17/2022 11:41 PM] glasgowm#0000
actually DarkFund0 uses it


[01/17/2022 11:41 PM] glasgowm#0000
But you need a node sync‚Äôd


[01/17/2022 11:41 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
Also Luivatra @C4lculista can I get some suggestions on where we should start with collecting funds and how to vote in treasurers?


[01/17/2022 11:42 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
I was going through the gethub and that is what I gathered. (re @glasgowm: But you need a node sync‚Äôd)


[01/17/2022 11:43 PM] glasgowm#0000
It works but a bit bulky, hoping anon_real releases his stuff soon.


[01/17/2022 11:44 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
I wonder if would be ok to start of with an honor system and plan to move to multisig later???
I like keeping honor involved amongst us tbh. (re @glasgowm: It works but a bit bulky, hoping anon_real releases his stuff soon.)


[01/17/2022 11:44 PM] Luivatra#0000

can't we make a DIY multi sig wallet? with a synched node? (re @Haskell_plus: Ok just to ensure that a bus does not take out a treasury, I need 2 other volunteer's to hold the se...)


[01/18/2022 12:47 AM] C4lculista#0000

@Armeanio how does the multisig wallet for the EF works? how do you all sign the same tx?


[01/18/2022 12:47 AM] C4lculista#0000
I think me, Chris and C sir have a synched node

I can't build shit! ü§£ (re @C4lculista: can't we make a DIY multi sig wallet? with a synched node?)

[01/18/2022 12:53 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
Ok so I will frame a raffle and send you guys the seed.
Will probably do a recurring raffle weekly so that we can have a weekly vote to spend funds for small projects on contributor's, we will need a framework in discord for how the design is to work (to change as DAO tooling gets integrated). (re @C4lculista: I can take the bullet lol)

Yes

I think we could give it a try


[01/18/2022 1:35 AM] C4lculista#0000
instead of having the seedwallet spread over the world


[01/18/2022 1:35 AM] Armeanio#0000
Zk treasury is an option but ergoteam is something we are waiting for.


[01/18/2022 1:35 AM] C4lculista#0000
we could set up a multi sigwallet that requires 2 out of 3 PK


[01/18/2022 1:35 AM] Armeanio#0000
Community dao anyway.


[01/18/2022 1:36 AM] C4lculista#0000

Could the sigmanauts DAO perhaps be the beta tester @anon_real ? Doesn't need to be huge to start.

Worst case pick three people who have a node sync'd - pinging all @Sigmanauts so they're aware of the convo above.


[01/18/2022 10:39 AM] CW#8500
Happy to put my hand up, my node is singing away


[01/18/2022 10:45 AM] glasgowm#9381
Admitted some of the @SigCan who had sufficient votes in #üó£‚îÇvote - **Welcome, and congratulations**! Almost 30 strong now! Will put some more candidates up for admission to the @SigCan. Still have another plenty of candidates to go through so will try and let in the best 15-25 next and will put votes up on a rolling basis. We can structure this more in future but I think a low barrier to entry is good to begin to kickstart the programme. 

Please ensure your correct wallet address is submitted in the registration form. Will try and mint/issue those this week.

If anyone wants to take on more of this organisational stuff feel free - I can upload the spreadsheet or grant access to the Notion just let me know. Didn't initially post publicly due to data-privacy concerns. On that note let me know if anyone wants any PII removed from #üó£‚îÇvote. Helpful to get to know each other (and lets me assign roles ^^) but appreciate you may not have realised it'd be visible to all sigmanauts when submitting. Will clarify on Typeform.

[01/19/2022 10:26 AM] Luivatra#9076
lets hope so, but like I wrote in some other channel the other day. The good thing with this situation is that a lot of devs got inspired to make competing wallets. I think in the end it is a good thing for the ergo ecosystem, but right now it is rough

Python is a good starter at least, very versatile. Unless you want to focus on smart contracts you shouldn't care about which language, just use the one that is fit for the thing you are trying to solve. Fe. for the backend of the tip bot I wanted to use Python because I am most comfortable with that, but ended up using a JVM language because it worked best together with the ergo appkit.


[01/19/2022 10:32 AM] Luivatra#9076

I wish I had a good resource for a beginner, if you do find one please share, because I get the question a lot


[01/19/2022 10:58 AM] glasgowm#9381
Depends on your learning style, what knowledge you already have and some other things so no one size fits all imo. Best resource is https://hn.algolia.com/ - search HN and you can find tons of people discussing what the best tools/languages/resources/etc for the job is

Tons of results for Haskell, not as much love for Scala so requires some tweaking 

https://hn.algolia.com/?dateEnd=1642589477&dateRange=custom&dateStart=1547251200&page=0&prefix=true&query=learn%20scala&sort=byPopularity&type=story

You can do full courses but I normally just prefer to skim through a few tutorials then start trying to tackle problems.

[01/19/2022 11:15 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
They are just facing a bottle neck in talent like every other software development company
They have been hiring forever now, Cardano community has let them slip and really has noone to hold them accountable, the community took $100m offering from Ken Kodoma at summit last year as a promise they are still committed, but Emurgo just looks all screwed up, luckily they have someone working on the wallet cause as you all who develop should know - there is a global shortage for developers. (re @NoahErgo: If this is true I would think it would be in the best interest of EF to find partnerships elsewhere ...)


[01/19/2022 11:17 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
They could have thrown some money at the wallet, but they probably weighed the return on investment and they earn squat off of a free wallet that does nothing to increase their holdings


[01/19/2022 11:20 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
You can see they have several stake pools privately held, and then like 4 that allow for community staking, they have money, they have probably just moved away from the initial goals they had to support the dApp connector and imo moving away from substantially supporting Cardano - as you can see the DC Spark guys had to leave to do bigger and better things than Emurgo ever will.


[01/19/2022 11:21 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
Money changes people, and Emurgo has a lot of fuckin Money still


[01/19/2022 11:24 PM] NoahErgo#0000

We need more people like Luivatra and MrStahlfelge


[01/19/2022 11:31 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
The difference between Emurgo and their ambitions and the Ergo Foundation goals can be found in between the lines of the organization goals mission statement - Emurgo wants to drive value for ADA holders (number go up) and that has always been their mission - the EF on the other hand is not about driving value for ERG holders (number go up) per se' but more for decentralization and providing tools for smart money etc.


[01/19/2022 11:32 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
Number go up is a byproduct needed (currently) to survive in the adoption of the crypto space.

[01/20/2022 3:11 AM] crandano#8951
nice, i actually saw Nico out in the wild a few months ago and was asking him about Ergo. He said no plans at the time for Ergo on Flint. I wonder if we could reach out and see how we could be implemented into Flint? It would be huge to be a part of a wallet that's implementing ETH/SOL/ADA/ALGO and it looks like lately they're working LUNA in. 

Milkomeda as well


[01/20/2022 3:25 AM] NoahErgo#0000

Hello guys, is there any post explaining how does a miner vote?

[01/20/2022 10:18 PM] glasgowm#0000
Getblok is implementing voting tokens so they can use them once they're live if they move their hash there


[01/20/2022 10:22 PM] Daniumy#0000
And what about the other pools, is there any explanation for the rest?


[01/20/2022 10:24 PM] glasgowm#0000
No pools have said they're voting no. If they want to vote yes they're fine where they are. If they want to vote no they'll need to move to getblok


[01/20/2022 10:26 PM] Daniumy#0000
Oh understood, so simply by being mining at one pool you are voting, okay I had read that but didnt know if there was any more specific thing to do (like modifying a file or anything)

Crypto, like all tech, has a lot of jargon, and you need a pretty good mental model to understand how mining fits into how cryptocurrencies work, much less how something like an emission change changes incentives. It's not so much about dumbing down as to talking about it in terms with most people have familiarity. Emissions, for example, could easily be explained in terms of student loans and mortgages and blocks in terms of financial statements. Add in trying to parse different languages, it's a wonder anyone understands anything.


[01/21/2022 2:32 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Dense. But, if the audience is Bitcoin maxis, this might be a good thing. Also, I wonder why so few people talk about Bitcoin's dust. If dust makes up half of Bitcoin, does it have a future as dust eats through more of the chain?

Can't say for sure, theres nothing ready to test with yet, they seem to be well able to deliver though so I'm hopeful! Even if it's a few weeks delayed its still a wallet built for Ergo unlike Yoroi which is probably spaghetti code at this stage üòÖ

It doesn't really make any sense to add to your piece. You're talking to maxis, and criticism will just put them off. I just mean more generally. If BTC is 50% dust, something I saw for the first time yesterday, it means there will be a massive migration off it, in 10-20 years. Bitcoin may very well be the WordPerfect of crypto. It seems like that's important information someone might like to talk about.


[01/21/2022 11:11 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Perhaps a dumb question, but does Cardano have a lot of choice on the wallet front, or do they just not know it's a problem yet because they don't have live dexes?

[01/21/2022 11:30 AM] crandano#8951
i haven't used Gero. Nami has a nice UI/UX. i've never had problems personally with Daedalus


[01/21/2022 11:35 AM] crandano#8951
looks like MetaMask needed for Milkomeda for the first few iterations. they mentioned Flint is just waiting on Chrome approval

[01/21/2022 8:54 PM] NoahErgo#4349
Do you guys have any thoughts on how we could incentivize development of some of the eips that have been stagnant for a while? Oracle pools 2.0, profit sharing dapp, ergofund, LETS, etc. some of these things have been coming soon for a very long time now and im wondering if there are any creative solutions to bring in devs for these things


[01/22/2022 12:27 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
Yup, incentivize and support someone who picks up the task, I am working over a raffle design for the first Sigmanaut fund - any suggestions on how much ERG we should try to raise initially?
If we can be involved with incentivizing others to participate in development we would like to see happen and we can commit to supporting them I believe we can surely begin to attract more devs. (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <Noah> Do you guys have any thoughts on how we could incentivize development of some of the eips tha...)


[01/22/2022 12:42 AM] Luivatra#0000
Oracle pools 2.0 is being worked on with waves enterprise I think. Profitsharingdapp is very close to how we will implement staking at ergopad. So if we get that working it should make it easier...maybe. agree with the thought in general though. Too many good ideas not enough devs (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <Noah> Do you guys have any thoughts on how we could incentivize development of some of the eips tha...)


[01/22/2022 12:47 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
We need to push ErgoHack III more in socials, like yesterday... imo I held a spaces with a focus on it and now I am in convo with a plutus dev that is doing some awesome shit I do not understand, he is looking to bring his privacy toolset to Ergo now, I am very optimistic based on the convo, and yo thx for tuning in and contributing @FoeniculumNFTs , think I fail at public spaces and it is nice to have someone in the ecosystem willing to speak in the "hip" social channels.

[01/22/2022 12:52 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
I am going to use that for my response to R today concerning state channels etc, haha! going to an ADAO meeting and looking to bring a SC Auditing DAO to Ergo so that those who qualify to audit can be compensated to do so, might have to train some peeps but I am going to be pushing for it over the next few months, along with everything else, lol (re @FoeniculumNFTs: My pleasure, thanks for hosting it! Sorry my Twitter had a brain fart towards the end)


[01/22/2022 12:53 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
not yet, I think just ERG, kushti's, and I thought I saw Lunadog or whatever get added., why no COMET? (re @C4lculista: can we do raffles with sigusd?)

SigUSD would actually be really cool, not sure why anon has not incorperated that yet, maybe wants to only work on what others are going to utilize. (re @C4lculista: but with sigUsd it would be better for financing)

i think the thought was that ergofund will be used for that kind of thing, but ergofund is still not finished so...


[01/22/2022 1:07 AM] NoahErgo#0000
would be cool to see sigusd in the raffle until then


[01/22/2022 1:11 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
Ya so how much Ergs should I ask for a Sigmanaut fund??


[01/22/2022 1:12 AM] NoahErgo#0000
Maybe 300 erg?


[01/22/2022 1:12 AM] Daniumy#0000
Idk, 400?


[01/22/2022 1:12 AM] Daniumy#0000
Yh around that


[01/22/2022 1:12 AM] NoahErgo#0000
and hopefully the EF will pitch in like last time


[01/22/2022 1:12 AM] NoahErgo#0000
wink wink


[01/22/2022 1:17 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
I think the sigmanaut fund could hold more weight than ErgoLearn, ErgoLearn is 2 guys and some new Ergonauts, and it is honestly a little centralized, I think the more ERGs we have to push the ecosystem forward the better, and we now have what 30? people involved, I think it should be double what ErgoLearn asked for, I wont plan to petition the EF this time to get it funded though. (re @NoahErgo: Maybe 300 erg?)


[01/22/2022 1:18 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
someone else can petition the EF if they think it is worhtwhile to demonstrate how we work within a DAO environment

I ve tried getting some spanish people interested in becoming Sigmanauts and help me with the stuff I do, but none of them seem to give a f.
Honestly I am about to finish university and will have to get started with the final degree project I dont know for how long will I be able to spend time moderating the chat, being active with the Twitter @ErgoPlatformES account, and translating the articles.
If you know any spanish speaking guy willing to help the community please let me know so that I contact him


[01/22/2022 1:26 AM] Daniumy#0000
I am the perfect example, I want to learn EScript and be able to create things for Ergo, but since I know nothing about Scala/EScript I just would not even think of applying for ErgoHack (re @NoahErgo: we need to find students and people looking to learn and gain opportunities and experience)

It is great you want to learn ergoscript, but I feel a lot of devs are held back by the thought that they dont know how to code functional/scala/ergoscript, but in eutxo the on chain part is super small. Go look at the ergopad github and tell me how much ergoscript is there compared to python.

[01/22/2022 2:09 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
If not then..... I will look for a new way to fund sigmanauts, I think it is important to begin with enough funds that it has an impact in our space, little can be done with little funds, also I want the sigmanauts to take it seriously from the start, a small amount of funds is hard to take seriously, if ever this association controls hundreds of thousands of dollars than it should have a good understanding about what the funds should be used for, lets not sell ourselves short, lets build something real.

[01/22/2022 10:08 AM] Armeanio#0000
It depends on how sigmanauts ends up being structured and the purpose it serves.


[01/22/2022 10:10 AM] Armeanio#0000
I could use an example if it is a community marketing dao...
That is a service. Some projects may want to allocate a small budget to the dao and funding becomes more sustainable.


[01/22/2022 10:10 AM] Armeanio#0000
Lots of potentially creative use cases


[01/22/2022 10:10 AM] Armeanio#0000
Community auditing dao or something similar. Same story.


[01/22/2022 10:15 AM] glasgowm#0000
I was originally thinking one individual DAO but splitting it like that makes it a bit easier. Have dedicated teams for different bits and have a revolving door with existing members voting in new ones and inactive ones out.

[01/22/2022 6:21 PM] Seedubya#0000
I agree here with both yourself and Glasgow. As the community and ecosystem grows it will only get harder to have a finger on the pulse in every area. 
Having a 2 or 3 level hierarchy will allow those more closely involved helping to make funding decisions
EF (dao) > sigmanaut dao > community do
(Federal gov > state gov > local gov (council)) (re @Armeanio: Maybe both? General macro and specialized micro. 
 My thinking is if the dao/daos are service orien...)


[01/22/2022 6:23 PM] Armeanio#0000
We are already discussing a community developer DAO. I would love to see a constillation of service oriented DAO's that projects can plug into from launch. 
Decentralized teams with project overlap for collaboration.


[01/22/2022 6:23 PM] Armeanio#0000
Long term if done properly it could decentralize the EF in a healthy way


[01/22/2022 6:24 PM] Seedubya#0000
Even better!


[01/22/2022 6:25 PM] Armeanio#0000
Since services has value it creates a potential long term funding mechanism for each DAO also creates the potential for open competition.


[01/22/2022 6:25 PM] Armeanio#0000
An example two decentralized marketing oriented DAO's that compete for funding.


[01/22/2022 6:25 PM] Armeanio#0000
A new project can build in their team/services from within the ecosystem. That would be awesome keep value in the network.


[01/22/2022 6:28 PM] Armeanio#0000
Too many DAOs imo are just focused on Defi token games. I would be nice to see a shift towards replacing traditional services. Give actors the ability to form common entities and replace the traditional services being used.


[01/22/2022 6:29 PM] Seedubya#0000
Yep! Drive innovation, not have people or communities sit on their laurels etc. (re @Armeanio: An example two decentralized marketing oriented DAO's that compete for funding.)


[01/22/2022 6:31 PM] Armeanio#0000
It can easily be explores the services that are already used by projects.
Marketing (text/video/visual)
Frontend Dev
Social Media Management
Business Dev (bringing in partners or funding)
Contract Auditing or Dev Assistance
ect. ect. ect.


[01/22/2022 6:31 PM] Armeanio#0000
Since there is already a market for projects it makes the most sense imo for the first phase of decentralization.


[01/22/2022 6:32 PM] Armeanio#0000
Just use market principles and decentralized tools to form an internal economy for projects.


[01/22/2022 6:35 PM] Seedubya#0000
How do you see the implementation of a sustainable funding mechanism? Voluntary tax in which people or projects make continued funding?


[01/22/2022 6:35 PM] Seedubya#0000
Rising tide lifts all ships situation?


[01/22/2022 6:35 PM] Armeanio#0000
If I have a project I naturally need to hire someone for these services


[01/22/2022 6:35 PM] Armeanio#0000
Then its a matter of reputation, reliability etc. Its a good way to have resources for growth.


[01/22/2022 6:36 PM] Armeanio#0000
I think it makes sense to hire a DAO with ecosystem knowledge and potentially reputation in the future.


[01/22/2022 6:37 PM] Armeanio#0000
VS an external person or entity who has to hop into a lot of unknowns. The system, community etc.


[01/22/2022 6:39 PM] Armeanio#0000
The market already exists and would be easy to replace with a decentralized alternative.


[01/22/2022 6:40 PM] Seedubya#0000
Yep for sure. Instil a lot of confidence but also gives a point of contact for someone who may want to build something and not necessarily have the market contacts and know where to start. 
To have all the resources at finger tips not only for newcomers but also existing and established projects is a huge value add for the eco system


[01/22/2022 6:40 PM] Armeanio#0000
Luivatra maybe was the first being hired. üòéüçª


[01/22/2022 6:40 PM] Armeanio#0000
Exactly it makes complexity of business a lot simpler potentially and gives someone native resources and contacts.


[01/22/2022 6:41 PM] Armeanio#0000
Which could accelerate growth, also give people the ability to "work" in the crypto space with less resources/contacts etc.


[01/22/2022 6:43 PM] Seedubya#0000
Recruiter dao :)


[01/22/2022 6:47 PM] Armeanio#0000
Could be a path for educational services. Projects need devs. The demand exists. I think understanding organic demand and then building ways to meet that using decentralized toools within an ecosystem could create something really special.


[01/22/2022 7:09 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
This is a goal worth working towards. (re @Armeanio: Initial funding is great but that type of community dao structure needs some sustainable mechanism t...)


[01/22/2022 7:13 PM] Armeanio#0000
It seems a shift towards common markets, services and enterprise vs tokenization/inflation/returns is needed with the DAO structure.
 Whatever I can do to help I would be happy to work towards this end.
It seems a nice alternative to the current incorporation structure. The focus there is goods/services business most companies aren't public or don't have a public share structure.

"Decentralized teams with project overlap for collaboration."
This is where the Sigmanauts enter the equation, the overlap would need to be structured to involve Sigmanaut officers in a overlook position, not a supervisor but more of a guiding manager that can track the participation and ensure the overlap does not fail one project or the next. (re @Armeanio: We are already discussing a community developer DAO. I would love to see a constillation of service ...)


[01/22/2022 7:19 PM] Daniumy#0000
I saw that you tagged an ADA guy called bigpey on Twitter and he happily accepted being a guest on ErgoTalk, this probably is a nice way of expanding Ergo, tagging a few decently known people and asking them if they want to conversate about eUtxo or privacy or whatever.

[01/22/2022 7:26 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
It would need a clear purpose, an officer like yourself that has the knowledge and information to direct people to the information that they might be seeking for a related project or the proper procedures that have been adopted amongst the various projects, this would help the success of the overlap and create a clear path of how the overlap would work.

[01/22/2022 7:40 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
I agree, this is something I think about when I consider where ErgoLend will be in a year, people should be able to make loans to a business startup in the crypto space that has a sustainable business plan and just as in the angel lending networks they would be able to have their investment returned while also retaining some stake in the business.
No Brrrrrrrrrrr. (re @Armeanio: So much defi is like playing hot potato with a grenade.)


[01/22/2022 7:43 PM] Armeanio#0000
The biggest common sense benefit of decentralization is simple really, open and borderless markets. Open borderless businesses etc.


[01/22/2022 7:44 PM] Armeanio#0000

[01/22/2022 10:15 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
I have been thinking about this, and it might be good to just shoot for a high fund - and if it fails then seek a lower fund, but I am leaning towards seeking community support for the Sigmanaut program, if the community does not see value in the Sigmanauts controlling a fund to promote projects and development then maybe we need to think about what they do have an interest in, spending EF treasury does not suit me, I think the Sigmanauts should be supported by the community and I think the community should participate in supporting projects on Ergo. (re @Daniumy: I dont think such a big fund would get filled tbh)


[01/22/2022 10:17 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
we should at least make an attempt to include the community in supporting the Sigmanauts before we seek funding from the EF, in this way we can show it is a community driven and supported program.


[01/22/2022 10:27 PM] Daniumy#0000
Yea we dont lose anything by trying


[01/22/2022 10:45 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
we only gain by trying, if the community truly wants to be involved in growth they will step up and start a conversation, if they are not interested in contributing to the growth of the network and supporting the Sigmanaut program then maybe more thought needs to be put into why the community does not want to be involved.

Yeah alright ty, didnt want to tell them not to conversate about those 2 projects since the chat was an erg related chat because I would sound like a dictator

Much better if I can just let it be


[01/26/2022 5:14 AM] Chris Ray#2713
Sigmanauts, I want to bring the upcoming hackathon into your view and seek support from you all to ask the Ergo Foundation to add more categories to the hackaton, imo the Privacy and Security Emphasis on ErgoHack III should just be an emphasis and the Hackathon's we hold should include all possible development that can come from our community - yet, with a reduced reward compared to the main theme of the hackathon.
I would suggest the hackathon include more subject's to hack on, maybe like;
1. The most creative.
2. Best L2 solutions.
3. Community favorite.
Etc.


[01/26/2022 5:18 AM] NoahErgo#0000
My understanding is that all projects are welcome, its just the hope that people submit related to the topic


[01/26/2022 5:20 AM] Chris Ray#2713
True, but also I have seen some fail to hit the target of delivering a Privacy or Security agenda, take the Casino for example, they just wanna gamble with their ergs, it has no sight on privacy or security, which excludes them from targeting a win imo


[01/26/2022 5:24 AM] Chris Ray#2713
I would like to create a vote for this, Sigmanauts can weigh in with a vote of yes additional categories will be a benefit to the Hackathon, or no leave it as it has been planned, we are in the eleventh hour and I think a 72 hour vote should suffice


[01/26/2022 5:24 AM] Chris Ray#2713
now how the f do I create a poll here, I can do on telegram but I would rather it be in this server.


[01/26/2022 5:25 AM] Chris Ray#2713
@glasgowm ? A little help please?

[01/26/2022 6:36 AM] Chris Ray#2713
I am proposing the Sigmanauts request from the Ergo Foundation to include more categories for ErgoHack III in a 11th hour situation,that would allow for more developers to be involved in the hackathon and also afford them the opportunity for a prize ,
I am proposing there be 3 additional categories of reduced rewards that are outside of the theme of the hackathon.
1. Most creative participation utilizing NFT's
2. Interoperability through bridging to other chains, (dex's etc.)
3. Community dApps of interest

Please vote up or down to include the greater community in the hackathon, and please consider that any funds for winners of a subject should come from the Ergo Foundation, also please keep in mind that this is not an anonymous vote as it held on discord and I will record who votes with a thumbs up or a thumbs down and if you do not vote within the next 72 hours you will be listed as not interested, my point of view only, not voting will technically be considered as abstaining.


[01/26/2022 7:01 AM] Chris Ray#2713
After 72 hours I will make a statement with either yes or no votes on the subject.


[01/26/2022 7:19 AM] CW#8500
How about we leave ErgoHackIII as is and ask the EF to have more regular hackathon's with both a specific subject matter and general (anything goes) hacks? Having subjects pinpoints growth and development point the EF and community wish to see addressed and people with general ideas not specific to a subject don't necessarily need to wait a long time for the opportunity to participate with a potential award


[01/26/2022 7:28 AM] Chris Ray#2713
Sure @CW  I will retract my proposal with 1 single  vote  against it, as I believe if Sigmanauts are not aligned they are nothing in this crypto space,you know me bro, cast the first vote, I will not judge you for it if you think ErgoHackIII should go forward as planned, but you better have some damn good thinking for the next one, we are falling in MC, no matter the tech, no matter the satoshi vision, if Erg goes sub 500> good fucking luck, all we did here was create friendships and associations, at this point in time we are now dragging Cardano down, haha, we need to either decouple or boost Cardano in MC or this eUTXO idea is going to fail.


[01/26/2022 7:28 AM] Chris Ray#2713

[01/26/2022 7:48 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
I voted ‚Äúno‚Äù because it might be too late to get sufficient exposure out at the nine yard line.

That being said I like the idea and fully support it for future ergohacks since I was bummed myself to learn it‚Äôs recommended we focus on the theme (speaking as someone who is a non-dev/programmer type and just wanted to participate in some way shape or form): https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/840316505849987092/929077855395119124

Yeh bit late, but wasn't happy with the organisation for this one in general. Having more clear categories, role-bots, etc. I think due to the success kushti wants to have them more frequently so it's certainly something we can put forward.


[01/26/2022 1:33 PM] glasgowm#9381
Pinned a message.


[01/26/2022 1:35 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
They seem to always get a few good dapps from them so the more frequent the better!


[01/26/2022 1:35 PM] glasgowm#9381
Pinning this discussion as I think it's important for all @Sigmanauts to read. Giving this some thought and will make up some slides or something to explain it. 

TLDR. DAOs (or clusters of DAOs) run by sigmanauts and managing various tasks/spending. Funded by donations, raffles, and selling services (ie, a community-marketing dao)

Ergohack open to any category but maybe sigusd reward for first place in a category we want to push.


[01/26/2022 1:42 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah the way I've taken it is - open to all. But you'd loose point for not being in the scope as we'd want to promote relevant projects as 'winners' (unless it was a great submission regardless ofc)


[01/26/2022 1:47 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
I've always taken it as 'open to all ideas' but preferably within scope, and it has put me off applying with odd projects in the past. I think giving it a scope can result in teams shoehorning their ideas into scope too.

Better approach may be to advertise the highest reward / funding for the best applications on the theme, and then do another lesser reward for general best project

Also realistically the higher volume of dapps being built on ergo is good for being this early. Over time some dapps will shine but until we could do with more dapps in all types of categories

reddit just passed 19.4k subscribed, that shows more growth than the token hunters on CMC, in my experience reddit followers and growth comes from the more serious that actually have a true interest in a project.


[01/26/2022 8:47 PM] glasgowm#0000
Yeah only looking through it as I need to prove that CMC are at it with our circ. Supply.


[01/26/2022 8:53 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
CMC is a good indicator of public awareness that a coin is gainin, I look at those metrics now and then, the serious follows seem to be ramping up lately and community is is adding more content,  kind of worried we might see an artificial pump that could impact ergo in the long run, kind of like the run up last year.


[01/26/2022 9:23 PM] Seedubya#0000
when dropping we almost doubled our MC rank whilst doing a 2.6x on watch list.

to check the minting address


[01/27/2022 12:46 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
New user comes on site, sees an NFT they like, purchase and it's fake without any banner, indication, anything of the sort


[01/27/2022 12:46 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
I understand crypto dyor is important but the user experience is just awful.


[01/27/2022 12:47 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
In addition, blatant remints of popular series on other chains isn't a good look either and can't be solved via minting address


[01/27/2022 12:48 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
I think it needs a banner of some sort on site to say all this. The opposite, which is ergo auctions actively making funds from allowing scams to run unhindered, is worse in my opinion


[01/27/2022 12:55 PM] Daniumy#0000
I think it would be cool to have an info tab that when you click on it, it displays a small message saying something like "There are bad actors that try to scam you by uploading fake NFTs, be cautious, you can always join our Telegram/Disc chat and ask whether an auction is fake or not. *Links*"


[01/27/2022 1:25 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
Is Luivatras solution offline? (re @HazeyOneKenobi: what can be done to fix ergo auctions image in terms of scam / fake NFTs?)


[01/27/2022 1:26 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
It picks up on previous mints on ergo, which is great no complaints there


[01/27/2022 1:27 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
My concern is more for remints from other chains or slight alterations making it past those checks, just the whole ergo auctions UX isn't great and doesn't advertise ergo well, whilst being one of our flagship dapps


[01/27/2022 1:51 PM] Luivatra#0000
Yeah it will be a never ending battle. Only real solution imo is curated "windows" into the ah that only show verified works. Like ergosaurs has done (re @HazeyOneKenobi: My concern is more for remints from other chains or slight alterations making it past those checks, ...)


[01/27/2022 1:58 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
Someone on twitter mentioned that we shouldn't wait until we need to build out a solution for people posting auctions for unsavoury images


[01/27/2022 1:59 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
And I feel that needs some form of moderation, maybe a system of mods flagging specific auctions would work


[01/27/2022 2:00 PM] glasgowm#0000
I believe someone was wanting to host a managed instance of it - but anon is unlikely to introduce any sort of centralisation. Hard to build a moderation system that wouldn‚Äôt be open to abuse also.

what‚Äôs stopping the scammer upvoting his fake one and reporting the others as counterfeit


[01/27/2022 2:48 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
Yeah there's different tiers of problematic auctions on there that need to be addressed differently, and that works well for each of them I think -
1. Unsavoury /illegal images
2. Copies of existing ergo NFT's
3. Copies from other chains
4. NSFW posts


[01/27/2022 2:49 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
So a scammer would flag as fake / NSFW, and it would just mark it but not remove it. It would at least give some indication to a buyer that it could be fake (re @glasgowm: what‚Äôs stopping the scammer upvoting his fake one and reporting the others as counterfeit)


[01/27/2022 2:49 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
The NSFW votes could be used past a certain count to apply an intial blur or filter them out entirely based on user settings


[01/27/2022 2:50 PM] glasgowm#0000

I personally dont like that


[01/27/2022 2:54 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
But this is why I lean towards a centralised group of mods, that method would still display the blatant ripoffs from other chains or artists. There's enough people looking at ah daily to keep it cleaned up, and if we can remove their ability to profit the scams would end and ergos image is improved


[01/27/2022 2:55 PM] Daniumy#0000
I also like the idea of the moderators, but dont know how It would affect the term "decentralized auction house"

[01/27/2022 3:13 PM] Daniumy#0000
What about creating something like a button about "submitting your verified creator proposal" 
And then the creator fills out a form with something like: 
His website(if any) 
His social media (if any)  
His username on the different messaging platforms like Telegram/discord (if any)  
A little description about the art he/she makes.
And then such submission gets sent by a bot to the telegram NFT chat, where users can either vote positive for the verification or negative, this way we make sure that real "unique" (or at least with unique phone number) people are the ones voting for art to be marked as verified or not.
While keeping the decentralization nature since there is no moderators, it is the community that decides.


[01/27/2022 3:34 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
I like the idea that anyone can post anything personally, the ergo space is open and permissionless and the design and architecture of the ah champions that really well - but I do not believe the content of it reflects the community at all (re @Daniumy: What about creating something like a button about "submitting your verified creator proposal"

I'd be interested to hear how you see LETS being useful there (re @glasgowm: Just shilled ERGO & LETS on a call with Disability Rights UK directors. She said she loved the idea ...)


[01/27/2022 5:36 PM] root7Z#0000
maybe having a rule like 90 days limit from wallet's first NFT mint or purchase to be eligible for voting protects from instant attacks (re @glasgowm: what‚Äôs stopping the scammer upvoting his fake one and reporting the others as counterfeit)


[01/27/2022 5:52 PM] glasgowm#0000
well in a macro sense - LETS can help tackle social exclusion and provide income, work, social cohesion, and access to financial services. Many of the most disadvantaged (such as those on depend on incapacity or disability benefits) have the most to gain from participating in LETS.
There‚Äôs also been about 25 Disability/Mental Health LETS already actually.

Ah yeah like simplifying the process for distributing funds.

looks like we need more of those nodes


[01/29/2022 4:08 PM] glasgowm#0000
We need a decentralised network of them with proper load management ideally I would think. The actual issue was due to disk space tho so shouldn't happen again. But yeh need more redundancies.


[01/29/2022 4:12 PM] Arohbe#0000
Curious if it was disk space or failed log rotation?  We‚Äôve seen some issues with failed log rotations which caused logs to become too large and in turn caused our nodes to fail.  Ultimately impacts disk space but the log file is the real issue. (re @glasgowm: We need a decentralised network of them with proper load management ideally I would think. The actua...)

[01/29/2022 4:15 PM] Arohbe#0000
Yeah there was supposed to be some updates with auto log rotation in some of the latest node updates.  I think we just increased disk size for the time being. (re @glasgowm: Yeh that would be my guess too it kept killing sigmausd until we changed the log settings. Surprised...)

it's kind of hard comparing and contrasting the different coins since they don't have a standardized categorization. i imagine if we can do that first it would be easier to visualize with an infographic or chart (dummy data below)

I tried creating an Ergo (blockchain) Wikipedia page. Pretty toxic environment. Anti-crypto. They'll hide behind the significance standard. Maybe someone who does a lot of work in Wikipedia could get it through. To illustrate, look at the history and quality of the Cardano page.  It didn't get on until it had somewhere around $40 billion in market cap, in May 2021.

Can you confirm this? Maybe they were being rude and deserved it (re @Daniumy: Apparently coinex spanish telegram chat is blocking people who asks about Ergo)


[02/07/2022 8:09 PM] Daniumy#0000
The guy who told us that he got banned after asking about Ergo says he cant join the group anymore so he thinks he is banned.
However I ve seen some other people not getting banned after asking about Ergo


[02/07/2022 8:10 PM] Daniumy#0000
He may simply have been a little bit rude, will let you know if somebody else reports an issue

thanks! has there been thoughts based around merge-mining? for instance, i know Elastos does merge-mining via Bitcoin


[02/09/2022 7:20 PM] Arohbe#0000
Yes, we are exploring this.  It would be interesting to mine erg and swap with BTC for example.  Could help improve Ergo's networks security, but also creates some selling pressure. So its a double edged sword in a way (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <crandano> thanks! has there been thoughts based around merge-mining? for instance, i know Elastos does merge-mining via Bitcoin)


[02/09/2022 7:35 PM] crandano#8951
awesome. 

how i understand Elastos merge-mining is that Bitcoin miners can choose to receive ELA on top without extra work needing to be done - Elastos benefits from the security of Bitcoin and the miners benefit from receiving what they would normally earn in BTC while additionally earning ELA. i wonder if something could be done within the eUTXO Alliance?


[02/09/2022 7:50 PM] Arohbe#0000
I think once there are more bridges sure....Currently the only way I see it being done is by swapping through some exchange (this will add cost) Currently with the framework of our SmartPool it is possible to create mining with dual asset distribution (Ergo Native Assets)  without losing hashrate.  Possibly an added fee but nothing compared to what actual dual mining would cost.  Something we are starting to focus in on as a future use case on GetBlok.io.  tbh ive never heard of Elastos.   Going to look into it more. (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <crandano> awesome.

[02/09/2022 8:41 PM] crandano#8951
cool, I just started looking into their whitepaper recently as I've been interested in peer-to-peer networks for storage/communication/etc so they're just one on my list - but I noticed they use AuxPoW. 

merged-mining where BTC miners can mine ELA during normal BTC mining operations for no additional energy, and the hashpower from BTC is used to help secure Elastos

then they're using Delegate Proof of Stake where ELA is used to vote on a set of Supernodes to conduct block validation

the actual task of producing blocks is conducted via this merge-mining, so DPoS nodes serve to validate the incoming blocks

"by combining AuxPoW and DPoS, Elastos has effectively built a hybrid AuxPoW+DPoS Consensus (similar to Ethereum's Hybrid Casper FFG PoS+PoW). 
due to Elastos' slower, ~2minute blocktimes - compared to Ethereum's ~15seconds - Elastos can produce a DPoS signature for each block, whereas Casper FFG can only do so for every 50th block making Elastos boast superior security"

I just found it really interesting and after seeing the GetBloks interview I was like hmmm I wonder if they (or Ergo in general) are thinking about things in this realm

[02/09/2022 11:27 PM] Daniumy#0000
However, since I am mostly a translator, and although I am up to date with every new thing in the ecosystem, there would be some technical questions that I would not be able to answer properly, and therefore would probably cause a bad impression about Ergo

Even if you don't want to take on Moderating/managing that space - good to have someone we can trust who can speak the lingo as the space is rife with people trying to run scams. 

I've also added lots of regional channels to Discord and bridged the ones I could with Telegram. I figure even for English speaking ones (aus/uk/usa) they'll be useful for discussing local laws, exchanges, and arranging local outreach/marketing.

Hey everyone, would there be any interest from this group to put together an Earth Day event for the Ergo community?
Online obviously, April 22nd, would be a good day to highlight environmentally responsible mining efforts, etc.

[02/17/2022 11:03 PM] MaSter_vierolean#0000
I can see that Bitcoin could (ironically) be the energy revolution earth would need. Take all the peak energy from wind an solar and put it into mining when it‚Äôs not needed in another way at this peak time. This could be a major catalyst for investors to invest their money into solar and wind farms. 
Also take the waste heat from mining and use it to heat homes etc. 
I think this just makes sense with Asic mining farms as mining from your rig at home wouldn‚Äôt bring off such things. 
What would be THE argument for Ergo? (re @Haskell_plus: Hey everyone, would there be any interest from this group to put together an Earth Day event for the Ergo community?

Would be a good opportunity to educate on the viability of PoW in the post-PoS landscape, in that PoS and PoW are both working to achieve the same goals and its a nonzero sum game for the crypto space overall. Also be good to outline that blockchains only require so much energy to maintain security due to the speculative buys on the underlying cryptos, which inflates the energy use / usefulness of tech ratio, and can't be controlled by miners. They simply react to market pressures (re @MaSter_vierolean: I can see that Bitcoin could (ironically) be the energy revolution earth would need.

It seems like it could use one as it is becoming its own project and it will be nice to have it separate from ErgoLend - just to compartmentalize.

Btcmanager pending 
The campaign  went out from the strategy as we preparer rebranding but meanwhile we have two events in a row 
So first one was ErgoHack- results are almost covered- for blog and AMA, 
And additionally I wanted to make a PR seed for 10 platforms
Scheduled for Monday due to best traffic 
But the question is that my region and we filled with military news 
Does it worth publishing these times, or despite of this go ahead and stick to idea to complete the campaign 
a goal is to reach 3M coverage, and it‚Äôs possible due to cases and readership of such media platforms

IMO we could push an article of two so it's in the ether to reference at a further time. 
Anything we push will be lost in the headlines about what's happening around the world at the moment. 
It'll be great to give the credit thats deserved to the teams but also we don't need to spend to much because of the lack of impact

It's a tricky one at the moment


[02/24/2022 7:30 PM] AngieHar#0000
The campaign is around 2-3k$
But not the moment

I do not think we would get lost in the headlines for who are audience is,
More I think it would be a breath of fresh air for those that are interested in such things, I think it would be good to not be swayed by global events and push the information out, these things build a history for some people and increases curiosity for people that are not really familiar with what ergo is.

The overall aim is to publish 2-3 news a month 
Do crow marketing 
Targeting 
And influence marketing


[02/24/2022 8:08 PM] C4lculista#0000
iirc, it was "just do it and share it here, unless is something critical and you need voting" (re @Haskell_plus: As I recall we tried to establish some style of voting structure and it was never defined, let me scroll back and quote some of the conversation.)


[02/24/2022 8:08 PM] Seedubya#0000
Im supporting, totally agree to get the information out there. just questioning to what extent do we push it?


[02/24/2022 8:08 PM] AngieHar#0000
You mean platforms? (re @Seedubya: Im supporting, totally agree to get the information out there. just questioning to what extent do we push it?)


[02/24/2022 8:08 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
Ya this is exactly what I recall (re @C4lculista: iirc, it was "just do it and share it here, unless is something critical and you need voting")


[02/24/2022 8:09 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
We need to set guidelines for sure, that are more concrete than what we are using. (re @Seedubya: Do we have a time frame for poll? Should we have create a standard time allowance for a poll unless otherwise specified?)


[02/24/2022 8:09 PM] AngieHar#0000
Niche crypto medias depending on the budget 
The average budget I said 3k for 10 platforms worth 3M views overall 
The CR depends on who is interested it the topic 
‚ÄúThree times touch your customer‚Äù thing


[02/24/2022 8:10 PM] AngieHar#0000
We don‚Äôt target on CT or coindesk 
Just tier 2 medias


[02/24/2022 8:11 PM] AngieHar#0000
So anyway I‚Äôm waiting for your decision


[02/24/2022 8:11 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
I would bet that any decision you personally make concerning marketing on this topic would be supported, at a low cost it seems that it is just a supporting measure that we should be able to support for all such official EF events. (re @AngieHar: I would like to post it on Monday 
So we have time 
But in normal conditions it would be good to publish at the day it‚Äôs announced 
So we planned to announce winners on Friday AMA 
Votes from judges completed 
What are the next steps?)


[02/24/2022 8:12 PM] AngieHar#0000
I would say long term measures 
But conditions differ from the normal life (re @Haskell_plus: I would bet that any decision you personally make concerning marketing on this topic would be supported, at a low cost it seems that it is just a supporting measure that we should be able to support for all such official EF events.)


[02/24/2022 8:16 PM] Seedubya#0000
Push internally tonight (my time) after the AMA and then to the tier 2 media on monday?
For 3k the cost is neither here nor there. 
These current headlines aren't going away anytime soon. Better to have the content out there.


[02/24/2022 8:18 PM] Seedubya#0000
Not sure many here have been privvy to our marketing strategies. 
If that could be better known then we can help contribute and distribute.


[02/24/2022 8:19 PM] Seedubya#0000
Im off to work, will hopefully chime in a little later


[02/24/2022 8:20 PM] Haskell_plus#0000
Ya this is why I think with a low cost it would seem best to leave the strategy decision in the hands of someone who does have such knowledge. (re @Seedubya: Not sure many here have been privvy to our marketing strategies. 
If that could be better known then we can help contribute and distribute.)


[02/24/2022 8:21 PM] Seedubya#0000
Agreed (re @Haskell_plus: Ya this is why I think with a low cost it would seem best to leave the strategy decision in the hands of someone who does have such knowledge.)


[02/24/2022 8:47 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I know we often clown on ravencoin but what do you guys think of trying to buddy up to their community as an alternate strategy


[02/24/2022 8:47 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Maybe its already been attempted?


[02/24/2022 8:50 PM] glasgowm#0000

[02/24/2022 8:50 PM] glasgowm#0000
What on


[02/24/2022 8:51 PM] glasgowm#0000
We'll get more structure with the DAOs when people will actually voten on stuff but even then small decisions like this don't need a sigmanauts vote I just recommended Angie post here to get feedback from people and make more of the marketing strat public


[02/24/2022 8:52 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Yeah not sure exactly maybe its not worth it. Miners usually just mine whats profitable


[02/24/2022 8:53 PM] glasgowm#0000
Once we have the structure it'd prob be a campaign you'd vote through rather than topics for individual PRs. I'd just highlight some things from the community or the community as a whole. But think ergohack stuff is probably worthwhile too to pull in Devs/ techies


[02/24/2022 8:55 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Oh sorry my suggestion was unrelated to the discussion here


[02/24/2022 8:55 PM] NoahErgo#0000
poor timing


[02/24/2022 9:03 PM] glasgowm#0000
They have nfts too üòâ (re @NoahErgo: Yeah not sure exactly maybe its not worth it. Miners usually just mine whats profitable)


[02/24/2022 9:04 PM] glasgowm#0000
But yeh their community is kinda shit. The active ones anyway. Just emotive miners mostly. Few of their OGs who knew what they were talking about came back for their emissions reduction but I guess they ignore the project mostly because it's inactive til some future point where it's useful.


[02/24/2022 9:10 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Yeah dead community probably not worth it then. I know i shill alephium but maybe theres some crossover there between communities as far as innovative PoW tech. I think ergo community is bigger than alph tho so might not even be beneficial


[02/24/2022 9:10 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
Any UTXO project is good for us in my eyes, the underlying tech connects us, and we can all learn from eachother realistically


[02/24/2022 9:11 PM] NoahErgo#0000

[02/24/2022 10:04 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I worked at Leo Burnett, but this is more media planning. Share of voice has to be terrible right now. But, there's other considerations. Do people come back to these articles? In this case, could we do a wrap-up that uses this material later? My sense is these questions are out of our depth and best answered by you, or whoever does the media buys.


[02/24/2022 10:07 PM] sotiris_oiko#0000
Gday mate! (re @Seedubya: Gday!)


[02/24/2022 10:07 PM] AngieHar#0000
Media never impacts performance in case of selling smth 
In case we speak of brand awareness or any brand metric as usual coverage it matters just for long term 
It always measures, comparing delta of engagement and retention 
In perfect case scenario (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <cafebedouin> I worked at Leo Burnett, but this is more media planning. Share of voice has to be terrible right now. But, there's other considerations. Do people come back to these articles? In this case, could we do a wrap-up that uses this material later? My sense is these questions are out of our depth and best answered by you, or whoever does the media buys.)


[02/24/2022 10:13 PM] cafebedouin#9837
All hard to measure, particularly in this environment. It's a judgment call, and you're in the best position to make it.


[02/24/2022 10:15 PM] sotiris_oiko#0000
How would you measure engagement and retention?


[02/24/2022 10:16 PM] AngieHar#0000
In general- analytics within channels for the last half a year 
Specifically from one PR on 10 platforms no way (re @sotiris_oiko: How would you measure engagement and retention?)


[02/24/2022 10:22 PM] sotiris_oiko#0000
OK so you'd get some metrics from these sources. Awareness is the first step on the marketing funnel, if used on the right audience it could have an impact. Within a proper marketing plan it could lead to retention (which is really important). Also some remarketing campaigns could be useful.


[02/24/2022 10:23 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Media was never in my wheelhouse, just basic reports on spend. Web analytics always used to require specialists, and even then, it was often hard to figure out what drove engagement. I suspect that hasn't changed much.


[02/24/2022 10:26 PM] sotiris_oiko#0000
They are useful when you find corellations and patterns. (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <cafebedouin> Media was never in my wheelhouse, just basic reports on spend. Web analytics always used to require specialists, and even then, it was often hard to figure out what drove engagement. I suspect that hasn't changed much.)


[02/24/2022 10:37 PM] AngieHar#0000
Agree (re @sotiris_oiko: OK so you'd get some metrics from these sources. Awareness is the first step on the marketing funnel, if used on the right audience it could have an impact. Within a proper marketing plan it could lead to retention (which is really important). Also some remarketing campaigns could be useful.)


[02/24/2022 10:39 PM] AngieHar#0000
Agree, media does nothing unless layers of mentions for trust from newcomers for a long term perspective
Like to warm userbase (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <cafebedouin> Media was never in my wheelhouse, just basic reports on spend. Web analytics always used to require specialists, and even then, it was often hard to figure out what drove engagement. I suspect that hasn't changed much.)

Hello everybody, I want to set up a raffle for refugee relief but
1. I would like your help with finding a group of people or even organization that actually helps the people on the ground
2. Make it really non political. This is about people helping people.

A lot of ppl I respect in the Cardano community vouched for him and he has already accepted donations. His twitter feed has a lot of information on how and where etc they intend to help.
Let me know what you think.


[02/25/2022 6:07 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
Guys?
Ok, I'll just set it up I guess.


[02/25/2022 6:09 PM] C4lculista#0000
just do it and we will not delete the posts lol (re @ergomergoadargo: Guys?
Ok, I'll just set it up I guess.)

Yep let's do it. Sounds great.


[02/25/2022 6:11 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
Share link as soon as its live and I'll share everywhere I know ppl hold erg


[02/25/2022 6:11 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
Feedback on amount? Should there be a winner besides charity?


[02/25/2022 6:11 PM] C4lculista#0000
set the goal low (re @ergomergoadargo: Feedback on amount? Should there be a winner besides charity?)


[02/25/2022 6:11 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
Nah just whatever the lowest amt for winner can be


[02/25/2022 6:11 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
5%?


[02/25/2022 6:11 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
Hold on need telling the dude how to get nautilus and stuff about erg etc


[02/25/2022 6:11 PM] C4lculista#0000
so it gets overfunded (re @C4lculista: set the goal low)


[02/25/2022 6:11 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
1000? (re @C4lculista: so it gets overfunded)


[02/25/2022 6:12 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
One week?


[02/25/2022 6:12 PM] C4lculista#0000
I was thinking like 200 top (re @ergomergoadargo: 1000?)


[02/25/2022 6:12 PM] C4lculista#0000
lol


[02/25/2022 6:12 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
What happens if it is underfunded?


[02/25/2022 6:12 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
Erg is at 2.7 (re @C4lculista: I was thinking like 200 top)


[02/25/2022 6:12 PM] C4lculista#0000
it gets sent back (re @HazeyOneKenobi: What happens if it is underfunded?)


[02/25/2022 6:12 PM] C4lculista#0000
the erg


[02/25/2022 6:12 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
Fails, funds are returned (re @HazeyOneKenobi: What happens if it is underfunded?)


[02/25/2022 6:12 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
2k USD is really not a lot of money at all though

Forwarded from Maarten_V: Oekra√Øne ladies asking live on telly here to anti tank weapons instead of money to fight the Russians


[02/25/2022 6:13 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
Set it to like 100 erg, it'll get over funded then


[02/25/2022 6:13 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
I'll just MAKE you make help me shill it like you've never shilled anything in your lives.


[02/25/2022 6:14 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
I don't think it should be political. But help people. There are rivers of people leaving their homes and belongings behind (re @C4lculista: Oekra√Øne ladies asking live on telly here to anti tank weapons instead of money to fight the Russians)


[02/25/2022 6:15 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
270 bucks?? (re @HazeyOneKenobi: Set it to like 100 erg, it'll get over funded then)


[02/25/2022 6:16 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
People will get it was intentionally funded low, I hope


[02/25/2022 6:19 PM] C4lculista#0000
it doesn't have an upper limit (re @ergomergoadargo: 270 bucks??)


[02/25/2022 6:19 PM] C4lculista#0000
you can sell it as "let's make this the most overfunded raffle on Ergo"


[02/25/2022 6:19 PM] C4lculista#0000
or something like that to get it hyped


[02/25/2022 6:19 PM] C4lculista#0000
270 bucks is better than 0


[02/25/2022 6:19 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
good idea. (re @C4lculista: you can sell it as "let's make this the most overfunded raffle on Ergo")


[02/25/2022 6:37 PM] sotiris_oiko#0000
Just an idea. Could we also have an artist make an nft series about peace probably and donate the earnings? Also @ergomergoadargo great initiative!!


[02/25/2022 6:38 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
I'm not comfortable asking ppl to work for free for my idea but I think they'll be inspired and do it spontaneously? (re @sotiris_oiko: Just an idea. Could we also have an artist make an nft series about peace probably and donate the earnings? Also @ergomergoadargo great initiative!!)


[02/25/2022 6:42 PM] sotiris_oiko#0000
Could we ask the most popular artists in this space to contribute with one piece each and make a series? They could also keep a small percentage and it would be great marketing for them too. Idk just thinking out loud.


[02/25/2022 6:43 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
I think winners can get NFTs with the raffle now. So you get a chance to win an NFT by participating in the raffle. That could make us aspire to larger sums. (re @sotiris_oiko: Could we ask the most popular artists in this space to contribute with one piece each and make a series? They could also keep a small percentage and it would be great marketing for them too. Idk just thinking out loud.)


[02/25/2022 6:45 PM] sotiris_oiko#0000
OK great, I just proposed this as means to incentivise people to donate larger sums.

ya id like to transcend the usual suspects. how do we get people that dont know about ergo to buy in. 

I mean its pretty remarkable that a global conflict is occuring and that Ukraine is legitimately on their own because of geopolitical red tape. Add that the mass majority vehemently oppose it.

I'll take the responsibility. 
But here we are talking about NFTs donated that are given as rewards to raflle ticket buyers. (re @FoeniculumNFTs: We already talked about doing charity auctions with Ile last year, but we stopped because it wasn't clear what the legal implications of doing so would be)

This would be shared on all socials of course. In order to get a larger outreach itd have to be marketed or through pantnerships/influencers and more..


[02/25/2022 7:00 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
Even Vitalik Buterin spoke out against the war and clarified it was his opinion because ETH is nobody's


[02/25/2022 7:01 PM] sotiris_oiko#0000
Better check all legal implications before like @FoeniculumNFTs suggested, but I m sure there will be a way to do this anyway


[02/25/2022 7:02 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
Ok. So what do we have.
1. Setting up raffle (on me, assume legal responsibility of donation included)
2. Getting Ergo NFT artists to donate NFTs which will be given as prizes to raffle ticket buyers


[02/25/2022 7:02 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
I'm safe to do it legally. And if there should ever be any consequences (highly doubtful) I'll take those. (re @sotiris_oiko: Better check all legal implications before like @FoeniculumNFTs suggested, but I m sure there will be a way to do this anyway)


[02/25/2022 7:04 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
Would you donate an NFT @FoeniculumNFTs & @tortodelivery ?


[02/25/2022 7:04 PM] C4lculista#0000
or you could set a percentage to pay NFT artists (re @ergomergoadargo: Ok. So what do we have.

Worse comes to worse I can buy it off you for a nominal fee and then I put it up. No one knows about this extra step but you are forever legally protected. (re @FoeniculumNFTs: I'd love to, will let you know when I hear back from my lawyer üôå)

No, but when you convert it or take it out you are supposed (according to *some* tax attorneys) file it as capital gains (re @sotiris_oiko: Crypto still isn't included in any law or the tax system lmao.)

another option on the raffle could be set the goal for 1 Erg and a week duration. that way there is no chance of it not funding and there is no roof to max out at.

Forwarded from SebastienGuilly: Hello Ergonauts, As we have promised to come out with a good plan on how to improve and make a great impact on Ergo(ERG). 
It has come to our attention that Most of our community members couldn‚Äôt bear with us, and now the Team/Developers has come to decide on what to do about the situation; Meanwhile we have discussed and had an agreement with Equity Guarantee Liquidation Ltd. to help us liquidate Ergo into Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin,Tether, Cardano and other valuable projects(cryptocurrencies). 
There is no price tag for liquidation hence you can't liquidate more than Erg's ATH(all time high). So as all suggestion, complains and efforts are been paid attention to. 
The Equity Guarantee Liquidation present three (3) representatives to help out with your questions and processes for the liquidation. 
The aim of the Liquidation is to enable Erg holders recover their loss and also to make Ergo better again.

Setting up the raffle


[02/26/2022 6:52 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
in the UK you need to pay taxes based on the fiat value of the crypto you gained from a sale regardless of when/if you convert it to fiat :s (re @ergomergoadargo: No, but when you convert it or take it out you are supposed (according to *some* tax attorneys) file it as capital gains)


[02/26/2022 6:53 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
plus capital gains/loss taxes/tax deduction if you sell said crypto for fiat at a price different from the one it had when you first acquired it


[02/26/2022 6:53 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
tldr: selling NFTs is taxed as income instead of capital gains


[02/26/2022 6:57 PM] Seedubya#0000
Yeah, just like here üòî (re @FoeniculumNFTs: tldr: selling NFTs is taxed as income instead of capital gains)


[02/26/2022 6:58 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
DeFi gains/staking too üò≠ (re @Seedubya: Yeah, just like here üòî)


[02/26/2022 7:01 PM] Seedubya#0000
Yep. The annoying part is income is income, capital gain is determined by income then is lumped on top of income to decide the tax payable.
Fair enough some would say
On the flip side though, if you make a loss, you can only carry that loss forward to reduce capital gain in future, not reduce income for that FY. (re @Seedubya: Yeah, just like here üòî)


[02/26/2022 7:07 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
But you wouldn't gain anything (re @FoeniculumNFTs: in the UK you need to pay taxes based on the fiat value of the crypto you gained from a sale regardless of when/if you convert it to fiat :s)

[02/26/2022 7:26 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
I'm just pointing out that different countries have different ways of taxing crypto since you mentioned that it's always taxed as capital gains (re @ergomergoadargo: But you wouldn't gain anything)

Sigmanauts,
I will be seeking a peer review of the tokenomics to decentralize the ErgoLend project I have been working on for the last... well.. since the beginning of the Cardano Kiva team my friend Rob put together in 2018, would any of you be interested in taking a look at the distribution plan and give me some constructive feedback?
Please let me know here or in DM, open critique is encouraged in this channel, please do not release to the greater community at this time.

Halo


[03/01/2022 11:47 AM] ergomergoadargo#0000
How would you explain this to a child?
"over-collateralized crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin"


[03/01/2022 11:48 AM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
Use something they value but is kind of not really valuable


[03/01/2022 11:50 AM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
And explain it as lending that to their friend, and getting something in return. But if their friend decides that say, sixty pokemon cards aren't worth a skateboard anymore, they have to give the skateboard back. If the skateboard becomes worth 120 pokemon cards they can sell it and give their friend back 60 and keep the other 60


[03/01/2022 11:51 AM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
Idk if skateboards and pokemon cards are what kids are about these days but yeah

I know what overcollateralized is


[03/01/2022 11:52 AM] ergomergoadargo#0000
Hold on


[03/01/2022 11:54 AM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
The algorithmic part is just the protocol rules I think, i.e doesn't need input from a human, has to be a certain % overcollateralized and has rules on if you can remove / add reserves based on the current levels


[03/01/2022 11:57 AM] ergomergoadargo#0000
An algorithmic stable coin has no collateral, an over-corrateralized stable coin does have a lot of collateral. 
There's something probably very simple I'm not getting because it seems oxymoronic to me.


[03/01/2022 12:00 PM] Gstoiti#0000
I think the problem lies in the definition of "collateral". Usually, the term algorithmic stablecoin seems to be used in contrast to stablecoins that use liquidation mechanisms.
So your sentence should probably read as:
An algorithmic stable coin has no collateral (that can be liquidated),...


[03/01/2022 12:00 PM] root7Z#0000
you should start with exchange values maybe :D also there are some points about fractional banking system :D (re @ergomergoadargo: How would you explain this to a child?
"over-collateralized crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin")


[03/01/2022 12:02 PM] root7Z#0000
actually, I think "algorithmic" is nowadays refers to rebase coins in general, which do not have collateral, but it also means governed with computational programs (re @ergomergoadargo: An algorithmic stable coin has no collateral, an over-corrateralized stable coin does have a lot of collateral. 
There's something probably very simple I'm not getting because it seems oxymoronic to me.)

We are going to start initiating a shift in marketing. 
The goal is to create more separation between Ergo Platform and Ergo Foundation. As well as empower projects in our ecosystem to increase their marketing and awareness abilities. 
We are going to be bringing @Seedubya on board to be the Marketing Manager of Ergo Platform.
The goal is to drive engagement, community awareness and marketing for projects on top of Ergo. This is the initial step to activating the Sigmanaut group that Glasgow has put together. Hopefully as DAO tooling comes together, we can further evolve this concept. 
Our current Editorial Team and Event Team will be shifting towards the Ergo Foundation (blog/twitter). Idealy the content/planning will still have overlap and can have a nice synergy in terms of parallel support.
More to come as this framework evolves/finds its rhythm.


[03/01/2022 5:35 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000

[03/01/2022 5:36 PM] glasgowm#0000
we can, but waves pamped because they have a strong prescence in Russia - think they‚Äôre fairly established there (re @Gazza_ERG: My thoughts exactly, I can see no reason we can't appeal to this community?)


[03/01/2022 5:36 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
Best man for the job! Break a leg @Seedubya :) (re @Armeanio: We are going to start initiating a shift in marketing. 
The goal is to create more separation between Ergo Platform and Ergo Foundation. As well as empower projects in our ecosystem to increase their marketing and awareness abilities. 
We are going to be bringing @Seedubya on board to be the Marketing Manager of Ergo Platform.
The goal is to drive engagement, community awareness and marketing for projects on top of Ergo. This is the initial step to activating the Sigmanaut group that Glasgow has put together. Hopefully as DAO tooling comes together, we can further evolve this concept. 
Our current Editorial Team and Event Team will be shifting towards the Ergo Foundation (blog/twitter). Idealy the content/planning will still have overlap and can have a nice synergy in terms of parallel support.
More to come as this framework evolves/finds its rhythm.)

Definitely seems like an avenue we could really excel at though, a Blockchain with financial tools for the people with a strong Russian core team!


[03/01/2022 5:37 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
Agree with this, might be good to alter the ergo plat twitter to 'Ergo Platform News' or something to remove the appearance of ergo team / core officially endorsing what is shared on there? (re @Armeanio: We are going to start initiating a shift in marketing.

Have been finding that on twitter if people like a tweet who arent following you, if you follow them soon after they like the tweet they usually follow back


[03/01/2022 7:38 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Kind of involved but a good way to expand growth


[03/01/2022 7:39 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
I join cardano spaces and just talk about ergo


[03/01/2022 7:40 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
The cardano -> ergo pipeline is pretty strong


[03/01/2022 7:44 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Yeah, that was one reason for the pump to 18$, but it ended with an unpleasant surprise at the Cardano summit (chainlink) for many, because their assumptions about the Cardano - Ergo connection were wrong. (re @HazeyOneKenobi: The cardano -> ergo pipeline is pretty strong)


[03/01/2022 7:45 PM] Seedubya#0000
Even going through the like list and going to peoples profiles. Comment on one or 2 of their top tweets. They'll usually follow plus you expose to their followers. (re @NoahErgo: Have been finding that on twitter if people like a tweet who arent following you, if you follow them soon after they like the tweet they usually follow back)


[03/01/2022 7:46 PM] Seedubya#0000
We need to start conversations around all the content. We have a lot of community members posting great content which are getting likes and retweets but no really engagement.


[03/01/2022 7:47 PM] Seedubya#0000
We can start commenting, asking questions, expanding their post content etc


[03/01/2022 7:49 PM] Seedubya#0000
Also commenting little snippets in other communities influencers posts. Nice concise content, non shilly so we can start to break out of our echo chamber.


[03/01/2022 7:51 PM] Seedubya#0000
Get community members active in other communities to gain respect/reputation. People visiting profiles will see you're then heavily in ergo


[03/02/2022 2:47 AM] cafebedouin#9837
You have a piggy bank that tells you how much is in it. Every week, your allowance is deposited in the piggy bank by your mom swiping a debt card, and the piggy bank will only give you a gift card that is 1/10 of what is in the bank, once a week. The 1/10 of the bank is the over collateralization. Combined with the once a week interval it's an algorithm. The fact that it's all digital makes it the same as crypto.


[03/02/2022 2:53 AM] cafebedouin#9837
For the stablecoin part, and to check for understanding, you could use hypothetical numbers and ask how much they could spend by week after some interval. The proxy for stablecoin in this example is the amount that can be spent.


[03/02/2022 2:59 AM] cafebedouin#9837
And for adults, you could just use a home equity loan. If you take out a $10,000 loan on a $100,000 house to remodel a kitchen, that's the same thing.


[03/02/2022 3:01 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Just replace the house with some intangible asset: stock, a patent, copyright of a song, or whatever. The only difference between these and crypto is that one is backed by law and the other is backed by math.

Ohhhhh I think that point is lost by 99% of us. Thanks üôè (re @glasgowm: there is no voting results to announce - 2miners isn‚Äôt voting until the final vote. Indicative voting was just to make sure we could get all the pools onboard.)

Anybody able to help me understand how far along nipopow based light nodes are to being a thing? Feels like something that is talked about a lot and i see it mentioned in dev updates but i dont have a great understanding of what the path forward on them looks like


[03/10/2022 6:42 PM] glasgowm#9381
@MrStahlfelge can maybe answer best on when we'll actually be able to use it. 

Think most of the heavy lifting is done in the node and sigma-rust. Full node writing snapshots done 24/11. P2P messages done 19/01 and moving onto bootstrap logic.


[03/10/2022 7:59 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
It's not usable at the moment. Some implementation is done in node but as far as I know it is not in the code level that is used by Appkit and other dependant projects. I raised this problem and I think an issue was made to move the implementation into the shared code base


[03/10/2022 8:01 PM] glasgowm#9381
What does it being in sigma-rust mean? Because the web-wallets are in JS right - or does that interact with sigma-rust?


[03/10/2022 8:04 PM] Luivatra#9076
Yeah sigma rust is compiled into a wasm used in JS

Could you in laymans terms explain where it is at now vs where it needs to be for nipopows to be practically useful, and then the steps that need to be taken to get there?


[03/10/2022 9:03 PM] NoahErgo#4349
nipopows feel like this opaque thing of like ‚Äúyeah they are going to be amazing‚Äù and there isnt much consumer level understanding beyond that


[03/10/2022 9:04 PM] NoahErgo#4349
and it feels disingenuous to just say oh yeah Ergo has nipopows without being able to actually talk about where we are in development of them

most of the backend in node/sigma-rust done. Not done in AppKit - can see sigma-rust progress here

I don't really know who is at that task which would be great to know.
I only heard some work is done in the node when I've asked for it. I guess it is integrated into the node to speed up syncing


[03/10/2022 9:35 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042

Forwarded from unknown: ErgoDesk: EIP-27 Proposal Passes Vote
Hey Ergonauts! Welcome to your weekly ErgoDesk Digest. In today‚Äôs edition, we provide updates on the EIP-27 soft fork proposal to extend the emission schedule of ERG. 
For several months now, Alex Chepurnoy (aka Kushti) and the Ergo Foundation have been educating the community about the EIP-27 proposal. This proposal was born out of a few concerns for maintaining the long-term viability of the Ergo network. Originally, the ERG emission schedule was to be completed within the next six (6) years. This would mean that block rewards would be reduced to zero at the end of the emission schedule and miner incentives would rely solely on transaction fees and the Storage Rent protocol. As the ecosystem is still quite young with a lot of plans in the works to increase adoption and utility on the network, it was suggested that the emission schedule be extended to support the growth of the network. In order for this proposal to be approved, the major mining pools needed to show their support. In a revolutionary display of the true potential of Ergo, one mining pool operating on smart contracts (Getblok) deployed a decentralized voting mechanism for all their miners.
Well, the results are in, and the EIP-27 soft fork proposal has received the necessary support for implementation. In simple terms, once deployed, the emission schedule will redistribute a predetermined amount of ERG to a contract that will be used to pay miners in the future. The reduction in rewards for each block will be set so that at regular intervals the block rewards will further reduce, allocating additional ERG to the contract for future emission.
With this necessary support to implement EIP-27, Kushti has announced on Ergo Forum that he has activated the soft fork on the testnet at block 180384. Currently, it is anticipated that the EIP-27 soft fork could be executed on mainne <clipped message>


[03/11/2022 8:28 PM] C4lculista#0000
so EIP-27 passed?


[03/11/2022 11:27 PM] Arohbe#0000
All pools support but not implemented yet.


[03/11/2022 11:39 PM] C4lculista#0000
I thought voting is yet to be done (re @Arohbe: All pools support but not implemented yet.)


[03/11/2022 11:44 PM] Arohbe#0000
It was delayed but recently implemented on testnet.  Now some work needs to be done for activation on mainnet.

Hoping to kick start the sigmanuts, 
I'm looking for a couple of sigmanaut writers and a graphic designer to help with Twitter posts on the ErgoPlatformOrg account.
I plan to create weekly Twitter threads on everything Ergo called deciphering ergo or the ergo code. 
They're designed to be read as an eli1, simplify a topic or feature. No techy buzz words, simple explanations and real-life examples of use cases. The aim is to reach the everyday person.
Will structure the threads as follows
Tweet 1 short intro plus infographic to grab attention
Tweet 2 to 8/10 explanation
Last tweet references sigmanaut article or existing article/blog
We have a treasure trove of information in the existing articles/blogs. It's a matter of simplifying, with examples, to the point everyday people can read and comprehend.

@glasgowm quick question, but do you know who made these awesome wallpapers? https://www.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/comments/s3v5s3/some_new_ergo_wallpapers

Ive come up with a css redesign utilising them and was wondering if we had permissions to use them for that kind of stuff? 

Old reddit redesign is complete and can be viewed at /r/ergocss. Still doing finishing touches on new reddit design.

thankyou! that would be amazing. everything is currently good but I currently need a render of 4000x4000 for the new reddit bg.  I can try make a reddit bg template before you render so you can see what will be hidden and what will be shown when people visit the subreddit

[03/18/2022 4:04 PM] glasgowm#9381
Test first in Discord to cache, then it should match after. Matching is easy but I'm also replacing the username for common speakers so need to see if one of them is working

[03/19/2022 12:42 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
Why


[03/19/2022 12:43 PM] glasgowm#9381
For posting threads saying it's not the real sub and to join r/ergonauts


[03/19/2022 12:52 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
who is running that sub?
and, somehow related, who registered ergowallet.app domain?


[03/19/2022 2:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
It was private when I joined Ergo. I assumed kushti or someone had registered it and forgotten about it - then after r/ergonauts started building it they made it public and leave it unmoderated. 

More of a PIA at the moment than malicious - but the fact they're not forwarding the sub onto r/ergonauts themselves makes me think they're at it.


[03/19/2022 2:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
ergowallet.app not sure - maybe the guy who done ergowallet.io though as it looked like he was starting up a relaunch?


[03/19/2022 2:50 PM] glasgowm#9381
```
If a sub if being used for something that is a violation of our User Agreement or Content Policy, please report the offending content so the team that oversees that can take a look.

@glasgowm do you think there would be value in adding a section to docs that has a list of useful APIs in the ecosystem. Ergopad has their api, ergo.watch is building an api, skyharbor will have a marketplace api, etc.

WAVES is the biggest ponzi in crypto

It has recklessly engineered price spikes by borrowing USDC at 35% to buy its own token

Continuous WAVES market cap growth is needed to keep the system stable

WAVES will eventually crash and USDN will break with it

From my point if view, majority of messaging and content coming out is rigid, strong and complex. 
I want to bring a light hearted, relaxed yet informative approach


[04/01/2022 4:46 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I think what draws people to content creators is the personality you bring to the table. And youre a likeable guy, so leverage that. I think trying to make it personal is smart, like when I go to youre channel I want to hang out with my bro CW for 15 mins while I have my morning coffee

what i mean tho is the name should capture that approach too. Like tims suggestion kind of get at that feeling


[04/01/2022 4:50 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I think having the name Seedubya isnt bad, its recognizable and people from the community already know you

I wonder what the best branding strategy is. To target people who already know Ergo, or to target new consumers

Do you think this means the channel name should be more general? Or would 'Seedubya' be able to attract new people?


[04/01/2022 4:58 PM] seedubya#0000
Depends on the marketing


[04/01/2022 5:00 PM] seedubya#0000
The way the vid is thumbnail, description, hashtags on vid desc, methods of distributing the content via socials etc


[04/01/2022 5:00 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I think you could make 'seedubya' more generally appealing. Even the tags you associate it with could be super general.


[04/01/2022 5:03 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Agree i think seedubya is good


[04/01/2022 5:04 PM] NoahErgo#0000
If you look at general market for content creators the biggest ones have channel names that are aliases similar to it, allows people to talk about the content and also talk about the personality and have both be identifiable as far as brand


[04/01/2022 5:05 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Could maybe get Marcelo to make a cool graphic for it or something


[04/01/2022 5:12 PM] seedubya#0000
Yeah, I agree.
 I know he has a ton on his plate but can ask. 
I've also budgeted for animations, transitions, graphics, etc

I feel like I have been brain dead for weeks, what are you thinking though? Keeping an Ergo theme in some way or moving beyond?


[04/07/2022 4:41 AM] seedubya#0000
For the ecosystem naming might be helpful as people outside if ergo can see. 
I've joined a few random spaces on the main account which has gone good when I can speak. 
I'll be doing more community chats when things die down a little here. Hopefully this coming week. We can get creative with that naming

Just posted this in discord (growth)
Hey guys, I have an idea for the graphic designers. @Noah  is doing an amazing job keeping sigmaverse up to date. 
Can we expand on that and create an ecosystem map of all the projects icons?
Another idea could be to see the ecosystem growth over time, using GitHub timestamps for when projects were added to sigmaverse. Say, starting when noah took the initiative we start there. Then group the projects added over say 2 months, then again and so on. 
Could be a good visualisation/infographic for the growth if the ecosystem over the passed 12 months or so


[04/08/2022 10:53 PM] seedubya#0000
Could be a good project for a sigcan with the skillset required

the engagement infographics bring is amazing. the impressions infographics receive on tweets are 10 fold or more regarding a tweet with text and a link. 
the aim is to have that initial engagement for someone to stop scrolling and look at the content. they can then follow a link to sigmaverse. these can be posted cross-platform, throughout influencers' posts etc
e.g. influencer x posts "whats the next big project"
Ergonaut 1 posts "#ergo" 1 or 2 likes, get lost in the 1000s of tweets
Ergonaut 2 posts "Short text explanation... #Ergo, @Ergoplatform Sigmaverse.io and infographic"
The engagement these bring are great

NoahErgo maybe drop it in the ergo watch channel


[04/10/2022 7:55 PM] BrothaChad#0168
nah it would be less than 38 years cause the re emission contract wasn't pushed thru on block 700,000


[04/10/2022 7:56 PM] BrothaChad#0168
i thought the re-emission soft fork was gonna be pushed through on block 720,000 - can anyone confirm this?


[04/10/2022 7:58 PM] BrothaChad#0168
based on my analysis, rewards would end in 2046 if the re emission contract is live on block 720,000

kushti also uses 21 erg here sent to re-emission contract but i think the consensus is that it will be 12 erg/block


[04/10/2022 8:01 PM] BrothaChad#0168
thx


[04/10/2022 8:02 PM] BrothaChad#0168
so i guess time will tell re the specific emission amount and block height


[04/10/2022 8:18 PM] CW#0000
reemission will be 12 erg until the initial emission reward reduces to 15 erg.  I guess the questions are

at what block height does mainnet activation occur to allow voting to occur (mining pools updating nodes) and 
at what block height do emissions reduce once a successful vote on mainnet occurs


[04/11/2022 12:48 AM] dashmunn#0000
Cheers guys, thanks for the insights, Ill remove the emissions metric until we have a final block locked in.

[04/11/2022 10:02 AM] BrothaChad#0168
here it states that EFTY token supply is 192330 and circ. supply is 171915


[04/11/2022 10:03 AM] BrothaChad#0168
does this mean that the treasury redeemed 20,415 erg, burning 20,415 EFTY, and there is still 171,915 circ. EFTY that hasn't been claimed for Erg?


[04/11/2022 1:20 PM] glasgowm#0000
Sounds about right - but I would‚Äôve thought it‚Äôd be more. I can try and find out

Using Erg buzzwords like "Sigmaverse" and by a quick look of it not really in line with any real development, just hopium right now.

[04/11/2022 5:28 PM] BridgeBot#9505
Haskell_plus That is alot of Ergs Jennie haha! Probably the largest raffle funding request to date.

On a serious note: It would be good to get some SigCans involved in distributing this and supporting education in the ecosystem, the conversation surrounding onboarding devs is still in early stages and there are many facets that could benefit from further conversation from inside and outside of the project.

Also if other ergo projects could be drawn into the conversation to add their thoughts to the initiative it could help DeCo recruit the next teachers and further develop the program.

[04/11/2022 5:41 PM] BridgeBot#9505
Haskell_plus I love how shamelessly you say "shame whales and newbies alike", one big point to hammer on is that this is a community effort that is driven by community participants and is seeking to expand and remain a driving force of providing knowledge for those seeking to be involved in developing in our ecosystem and along the lines of the ergo ethos.

There is also a project in development coming from Cohort 1 that is planning to plug into DeCo, we are so early and we already have such in development as an example of the force this program can have.
I think the project is called Ergo-school or something like that.

New banner for /r/ergonauts. Took a bit longer than I originally imagined after seeing some projects not having logos so I created some for them.

This weekend, ill spend some more time expanding the banner to add the following projects:
* Paideia
* NightOwl
* Eternaeon
* Ergo Tutorials
* DeCo
* Borscht Drop
* Minotaur
* Satergo
* As well as updating Ergo Watch's logo as they apparently have a different logo in the works.

After that, I start doing /r/ergotrading and the 20k ergonauts subreddit infographic I started a while ago that's been sitting in limbo.

Sharing info on app-level privacy features always gets a jaw drop I've found.

feels like if we keep pushing on utxo alliance channel, this could be a great way for sigmanauts to help growth. Sigmanauts reaching out to communities to bring more people in to the channel.

 I don't know him, but I don't think it's the kind of situation where he might not have known what he was saying. For me it's a clear signal to take a step back and observe. Just let him be in order to see who he is.
Explaining to him how it looks is just giving him a way to correct the form to what is pleasing without altering the substance.

 True...To me it'd be useful to see how he responds, and see if he'll stay involved if he can't go around claiming to be "in charge of Ergo Spanish platform".

That's a big claim & allowing it can lead to very bad outcomes.


[04/14/2022 6:32 AM] TypoDaPsycho#0000

ofc yeah, that should be the default unless they're known which most I've put up aren't (apart from Willford)

Hey Sigmanauts! 

Armeanio and I are going to release fortnightly vids, just shoot the shit about Ergo, whats going on in the community and crypto industry. 

Seeking some thoughts and suggestions on naming. 

A couple of ideas:

 I agree, but at the same we need to be nominating SigCans to be Sigmanauts at some minimal rate. 

We can't be voting SigCan on virtually every applicant and not using the nomination process to grow.


[04/20/2022 5:39 AM] TypoDaPsycho#0000
Kinda hypocritical since I haven't nominated anyone. Just something I've been thinking about.

 No, it's a good consideration. I could definitely message people about it, see if they would be interested.


[04/20/2022 5:59 AM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
If nothing else it would be a good way to spread the word about the sigmanaut program among people who show interest for ergo :)

He has been doing a lot of good work. I think if he was a sigmanaut it should just be made clear hat he isnt a representative for ergo foundation or anything like that

He thinks ergodex has gone to the komodo team to steal atomicdex their code?

the utxo alliance members should get back and stay in their own lane?

thinks because because opensource code cant be utilised by anyone?

It means the seed has been updated man it says it right there


[04/25/2022 3:00 PM] JOFLITO#0000
Forwarded from So: The charts have data from two places:

 1. I run a simple scraping process that digs out all of the box swaps that have happened for ErgoDEX from the public explorer and creates the initial seed for what you see - it's a static data set at https://jimmyhoffa.github.io/ergo-market-charts/ticker.json

 2. The page stores the last 5000 prices for each token in chrome's local storage, and every 10 minutes it will check for new token prices - if the price has changed, it adds that to the charts and the local stored prices

I don't run the scrape to update the seed that often, but each time you go to the site it will add data to your local storage to give you some data since last time I updated seed


[04/25/2022 3:00 PM] JOFLITO#0000
Forwarded from So: If you check the site frequently, it will look like the data isn't too stale, if you check once in a while the charts will start having long runs of straight lines from last time you checked to the current moments update etc

I've added the Sigmanauts role to #üó£‚îÇincubator. No particular reason other than I'd like to open that chat up a bit more so people use it. Also, a few of you should probably be in there anyway (will speak to stacie about updating it).


[04/27/2022 2:14 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
Question: what‚Äôs the difference between #üó£‚îÇincubator and #üó£‚îÇidea-incubator  ?


[04/27/2022 2:30 PM] glasgowm#9381
idea-incubator is a public chat (bridged with an ergopad idea incubator telegram). For general discussions about new ideas / stuff to build. Incubator programme aims to make discussions between ef<>ecosystems projects better - but they each have their own channel too so the #üó£‚îÇincubator channel is just a place for all the people building on ergo to congregate.

 Dude could it be Kristoff?


[05/01/2022 3:27 AM] Arohbe#0000
Here‚Äôs a couple reasons I think why. 

1. He went MIA.  Told me his mother died. 
2. He made those GetBlok I voted NFTs.  The 1/25 are NOT the ones I minted for Proof of vote 
3. They have a Glezcon NfT he did the piggy project with her. 
4. They have a lot of Chicken nuggies.  Over 1m.  I only gave that much to him.

Hi guys wanted to check and see what we all have been working on recently, dev update style.
This week I added a bunch of new mining pools to the sigmaverse site, dev tools section coming soon.
Have been doing the usual searching for new projects, recently been especially interested in finding smaller profile haskell devs to poach for ergohack. If you know of any please let me know!

Recorded 3 vids,
dev update with Armeanio
EIP27 update 
ergohack suggested ideas. 
hosting the African team on the ground in Kenya training people on ErgoLend on Spaces this coming Sunday. Still drafting my "What is Ergo" video.
usual stuff on twitter

we did refund contract on Comet, so that's kinda cool


[05/07/2022 9:25 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Any ideas for my next article?


[05/07/2022 9:26 PM] dann#0000
(re @TIMRŒ£G7 : *Any ideas for my next article?*) 
 
 Hmm, prob something regarding ErgoDex spectrum?


[05/07/2022 9:26 PM] dann#0000
Seems like a topic that needs an article for noobies like me


[05/07/2022 9:28 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
So far my options are decentralization, comparing carbon footprint of PoW to various things, use cases for NFT's...


[05/07/2022 9:28 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I think scaling is a good topic too, could focus on spectrum. But that article just came out and they are smarter than me haha


[05/07/2022 9:31 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Could do something titled 'unstoppable money', focus on decentralization, fair start, nipopows etc


[05/07/2022 9:32 PM] NoahErgo#0000

(re @NoahErgo : *Hi guys wanted to check and see what we all have been working on recently, dev update style.
This week I added a bunch of new mining pools to the sigmaverse site, dev tools section coming soon.
Have been doing the usual searching for new projects, recently been especially interested in finding smaller profile haskell devs to poach for ergohack. If you know of any please let me know!*) 
 
 About this, not much hard work regarding ergo itself coming from me, spanish Twitter acc is inactive, I rarely find time to post there unfortunately, im just doing the basic moderation of the spanish chat with Jos√©.

Dont feel bad about it


[05/07/2022 11:26 PM] CW#0000
Here is an idea, 
Update the ergo handbook in anticipation an approved vote of EIP 27, updated tokenomics and emission schedule. 
A couple of other things on there, update the road map and a couple of other things sigmaverse update etc


[05/07/2022 11:37 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Not a bad idea!


[05/07/2022 11:42 PM] crandano#8951
Hey Sigmanauts, I've been chatting to some teams about joining ErgoHack and giving them info. For instance, MetaDEX - formerly Mirqur - seemed interested. There was a live talk with their founder not long ago and he mentioned how it would be fun to start doing hackathons and we talked up Ergo. He seems very interested in the community.

I've been working on a project idea and should have more to show in the coming months - art collective, educational with some people I've known in the space for a while now.

I'm working on the DeCo classes that have been posted and we started a small group on Urbit about learning Haskell and ErgoScript (as well as another group where we just shoot the shit on new projects - an extension of the Global Institute of Cardano Small Cap Research and Development aka GICSCRD where it actually originally came about from people that met in Ergo when there was hardly any people in the Telegram)
- i'm still not sure what to think of Urbit overall. great concept and I saw ADAO is implementing Urbit things. I really started having interest in Ergo via Robert Kornacki back in the day and he has been hyped on Urbit for a while now, so I finally started digging in. There's some weird shit with the history there though (the history of Urbit I mean). 
- if you're interested in joining the group(s) I could get you a planet and help get you started

I've been really interested in SingularityNET and lately Empowa - starting to attend their ambassador meetings. Maybe there's some partnerships or something they'd like to do with Ergo there. I'll definitely be talking Ergo, though, no matter what.

I have some free time though and I'm up for suggestions. I'd love to start helping out more.


[05/07/2022 11:43 PM] crandano#8951
Maybe we should schedule a time to meet up in a voice chat, talk about what needs to be done / what we have been doing, shoot the shit, etc?


[05/07/2022 11:43 PM] crandano#8951
even if it's a once a month thing maybe that could be helpful?


[05/07/2022 11:48 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I am in a telegram channel with the metadex guy if you want to connect?


[05/07/2022 11:49 PM] crandano#8951

[05/07/2022 11:53 PM] crandano#8951
Yeah, definitely, and they're great about taking suggestions. I'll keep you all updated on what the ambassador program looks like. Really interesting project to me


[05/07/2022 11:57 PM] crandano#8951
NuNet, off-branch of SingularityNET, are doing something with Stake Pool Operators on Cardano. I wonder if there's something that could be done with Ergo?

SingularityDAO and their use of dynasets - well, something I've been thinking about a lot I'll post a tidbit from a group I'm in. It's hard to find people to talk about it - but something I'm really interested in as there's so many DeFi projects and everyone is doing a token now and people are just searching for yield.

Armeanio actually had a great conversation about this on Jami (@thinkgrowcrypto) the other night about how projects need to think about incentivizing for the next 100+years and not the short term. Everyone is just migrating from project to project to pillage yields.

Well, with things like DynaSets being somewhat proven (something like 15-20% better performance over the last year in BTC, at least) - what happens when AI just creates a DeFi DynaSet?

AI doing tons of trades in seconds for us. I've been thinking a lot about governance tokens and it seems like I'd want a governance token that is in AI or some sort of yield aggregator

but interesting to think about, just ranting

 go ahead looks so cool and it's a celebration after all.  
the only thing I would ask is for you to remove the octagon from the social media logos and divide it into 2x2 instead of 3x1 it will be more balanced and the numbers can be positioned to the right of the social media logo in question. Sorry i always want to improve visual things so i write thinking lol

i'm not sure how much heads up we typically have on Twitter Spaces but maybe if we could give more heads up (a couple days, maybe a poster or image) we would have more people involved. we could start keeping our Announcements channel more updated on Discord. it would give us time to share it to various channels. maybe we could get people like @thinkgrowcrypto etc to co-host a space at some point for more reach?

 Yeah normally have it announced mid week. I do these at 3am Monday my time.

If we can bridge the Cardano gap with people involved in both communities it can bring more adoption and engagement. Also want to keep it Ergo centric and not turn into an ADA platform. 
I think its really important to the messaging becomes one of "Ergo is not a Cardano token"


[05/08/2022 8:02 PM] NoahErgo#0000
And also ergo doesnt rely on cardano

 absolutely, i mention thinkgrowcrypto because a lot of time her spaces are 50/50 Ergo/Cardano (Armeanio or someone will join and chat) and she has co-hosted with Charles and whatnot. definitely agree Ergo doesn't rely on Cardano - too much hype on that last year kind of hurt Ergo in a way with rumors floating around and people expecting large announcements at the Summit

 Although I plan to put more time into ergolend once it is funded all of my scheduling has been a nightmare up til now, collaborations at this point would need focused organization and roadmaps with a clear to design of how to achieve milestones, I am head hunting project contributors to take a role as Project Manager or similar position to work with me and I expect to incentivize the work done by using the treasury created by the presales of EXLE.

 Could be a very promising collab, you willing to head it up then?
The ERG <>ADA crosschain stuff requires a lot of work and trust on the social side, if you were to manage the project you could probably tie it into all the other Erg stuff you do and maybe even tie everything together like frosty has done but doing it on a more complicated financial side of it.

[05/10/2022 2:16 AM] NoahErgo#0000
this is what Glen the cofounder said:
"Hey @NoahErgo 
I do not know this project but I am very bullish on #realfi applications.
As in the dotcom era, there is a lot of hype but there is also a lot of opportunity in real world use cases where the technology can create entirely new opportunities.
In the Empowa space, we know it is a $17 trillion market - not a new market because people pay to live - wherever they live - but untapped because it is invisible to existing financial systems. There will be #realfi winners and losers but there are huge and exciting untapped market opportunities in this space."


[05/10/2022 2:35 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
I have no idea where we were talking dang it, all the NFT pfp's and name changes it drives me crazy keeping track of who is who, for the most part someone would need to manage a collab Noah, so if you are interested lets get past this token sale that has me stressed to the gills and see what we have to work with to incentivize you or someone to take care of such through a funding proposal that pays out of treasury.


[05/10/2022 2:37 AM] NoahErgo#0000
i probably dont have the bandwidth to handle that, im able to troll around on twitter and telegram while im at work during the day but trying to manage an actual project i dont think i have the time for.

When I recently set up my windows node I created the ergo.conf as normal. Text file save as .conf.
It wouldn't recognise the .conf either and took a while to realise it also put .txt at the end but wouldn't display the extension. 
So in the folder it was ergo.conf but in reality it was ergo.conf.txt
Drove me nuts for 20 mins lol.

should we keep having this bot post in the announcements channel? it just comes off a little sloppy to me - probably just needs tweaked a bit. when i'm checking out a project for the first time i typically enter their server and hit the announcements channel first to see what's up. 

Also, if anyone has anything they ever want thrown on the announcements channel feel free to let me know / post here. I still miss videos occasionally until last minute or a day or two after they're already posted

Hey guys as we move into bear market territory what do you guys think about as far as shifting strategy a bit? Seems near impossible to achieve any kind of grassroots marketing in current conditions


[05/21/2022 8:09 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
In a bear market I feel like the most import thing we could do in bring in as make ways to bring in developers. That way when the market is back up there is products. We still have a incredibly small developer base ( although increasing)

What do you propose?


[05/21/2022 8:11 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
That place is a joke SMH


[05/21/2022 8:13 PM] NoahErgo#4349
I agree and have been thinking the same strategy is a good one. As corny as it sounds I think engaging with newer less established devs and encouraging them, showing interest, connecting them with other devs and resources is super valuable. People new to the dev ecosystem might lose interest or get disheartened if they get stuck. I think showing interest in what they are making and chatting about their project keeps the flame alive a bit


[05/21/2022 8:14 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
I have a Pi 400 arriving this week, I‚Äôm beyond excited, I‚Äôll definitely node it up


[05/21/2022 8:14 PM] NoahErgo#4349

One of the new ergohack projects is a EVM dev trying to build an ERG <> ETH dex bridge and ive been trying to hype the fuck out of his project, sharing resources, etc. constantly just to keep him engaged and retain him as a dev


[05/21/2022 8:18 PM] NoahErgo#4349

üëç 

[05/21/2022 8:21 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
I think new devs are good, I think talented experienced ones that just dont happen to know the benefits of developing on the platform are better. For the sole reason that they have produce new products quickly, but that has its downsides to consider as well.


[05/21/2022 8:22 PM] NoahErgo#4349
Any idea what other softwares use Scala?


[05/21/2022 8:22 PM] NoahErgo#4349

[05/21/2022 8:23 PM] Gstoiti#0000
We should also focus on producing good tutorials (in different languages).

{Reactions}
‚ù§Ô∏è 

[05/21/2022 8:30 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
Wooof I am definitely not the one to answer that question 

But I also dont think its finding people that know scala will help. Yea scala is one portion of the pie that it takes to be a successful developer on here but maybe we need to set up a way for people to connect with each other on ideas. Someone might have a business model in mind, someone might have full stack experience, and someone might have knowledge of scala, and maybe all 3 have a desire to be entrepreneurs in this space. 

I think that‚Äôs what we need. Lone wolfs are great but finding someone that has it all is gonna be difficult.

We could host a retreat or something. Like a weekend where we invite the community and divide into groups and host discussions and places for people to talk. 

That way we can get people to be there own hype men?

Sorry for the rant lol after just going through DeCo I have been thinking about this A LOT


[05/21/2022 8:31 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
Yes tutorials ALWAYS help

I agree but closest thing to that currently is the idea incubator of ergo hack and even then seems like most people go lone wolf even when sharing their ideas ahead of time


[05/21/2022 8:35 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
Hmmm ya i can see that .. well i think that most people are very afraid to sound dumb. Especially in a room full of people they think are smart. Even the people in DeCo mostly dont say anything for this very reason. IMO


[05/21/2022 8:41 PM] glasgowm#9381
dev spaces are pretty hostile to shilling/crypto unfortunately. Lots of places use scala but more backend stuff rather than hobbyist. Can write the off-chain logic in a bunch of langs though, and not required to learn ergoscript either. 

I've been answering q's in r/cryptodevs when I can, ideally the easiest sell is someone interested in finance/economics/governance with a programming bg

Broadly,
- optimise for agency
- optimise customer journey
- following a growth model, build up linear channels, drive compounding growth.

But in terms of a strategy we can adhere to; currently mostly about supporting community marketing anyhow we can / whatever ideas people have. Beginnings of structures on the onboarding doc - gravitating more to Twitter being our main front as it has the easiest access but open to any ideas here.

I feel like DeCo could benefit from some sexy marketing appeal. The program is super valuable but currently has a very DIY garage feel. I think its too early for that currently but something to think about long term


[05/21/2022 9:16 PM] NoahErgo#4349
Once rosen bridge is live i think making a big push into other communities for implementation could be effective too


[05/21/2022 9:16 PM] NoahErgo#4349
Particularly communities seeking greater market access


[05/21/2022 9:36 PM] CW#0000
All valid points and in addition I'm targeting miners.
In essence miners are about profits, it's their business. 
Many have heard of ergo but know nothing about it other than a couple of basics like supply. 
Building miner base pre and port Eth merge can bring 000's into the ecosystem. 
Once in they tend to interact with the ecosystem. Devs, tinkerers, investors etc.
This is a huge addition to the ecosystem.


[05/21/2022 9:38 PM] CW#0000
I've been in DMs with many of the mining influencers and they love what they see. Atm it's just not profitable for their big farms
Slowly some are coming over to spec mine so that's great to see

Agree with focus on devs and miners. I would still add users to the mix too. 
We will soon have tools that allow interesting work with some specific demographies.
For example, I am talking to political science people about the experimentation that pseudonymous governance models allow. 
Also, I am talking to people interested in charity about Ergolend. Especially reseaechers in this field recognize the importance of having actual ties between givers and recipients. Ergolend can foster that, and it sparks interest. 
So, as more use cases arise, there is always a chance to attract normies who are interested in that field to try out. Catching these users is much more important than the moonboys in bull market imo.


[05/21/2022 10:06 PM] CW#0000

Miners make up the bulk of our traffic (subreddit is about half the size too). I feel like only about 20% of them engage though. Might just be the way it is. Maybe some nice graphics showing 'perks' ergo has for miners (storage rent assumptions, on-chain governance, etc).

[05/21/2022 10:25 PM] crandano#8951
big agree that we should promote DeCo more - those classes being available to anyone now online is great and spreading the word that they can sign up for future classes would be beneficial

definitely the focus on miners is great as the ETH Merge seems to be coming. what Ergo allows miners to do seems really special. infographics broadcasting what's available and what's coming for miners would be nice

I think a problem Ergo has sometimes is the overhype on the advanced tech without setting at least loose dates for release or taming expectation - something that really got me into the project during the start was all the talk about Oracle Pools, NiPoPOW, bootstrapping nodes like it's no problem on devices like a Pi, etc. I know it's hard to put a date on things but at least a loose outline of where we're at more transparently about all of these things would be nice. We've been hearing about Oracle Pools since Kornacki mid-2020 (maybe earlier?) and it's kind of hard to guesstimate where we're at with that. I know it's being worked on and I know the community can overhype things - especially last year leading up to Cardano Summit, for instance.


[05/21/2022 10:28 PM] crandano#8951
I know we do the Dev Updates but I think for a normal person it's hard to know where the goal line is for some of the things being worked on


[05/21/2022 10:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
For oracle-pools it's more a misalignment imo. They've been out since before I joined, but undergoing improvements now based on use. But ultimately they're a framework/structure for people to use and not a competitor to a centralised data-feed provider. Which is what people assume based on knowing what LINK is. So still needs someone to build them out / market it. (and Vasil HF for ada in particular)


[05/21/2022 10:37 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
There are different stages of the customer journey though. 

Just highlighting the tech is only going to incrementally increase customers where we carve out an overhyped and crowded space; with the media only talking about moonboys or the latest scams. For sustainable, long term marketing, strategy needs to focus on people outside of the space who do not have an affinity for blockchain/crypto. 

Need to talk about Ergo without talking about Ergo.

random thought. what if we do an Ergo SPO on Cardano? support projects that are going Cardano<>Ergo<>UTXO Alliance (maybe the delegators get a little kick of those tokens as they roll out if a project wants to do something like that / if it makes sense). operator fees go towards cost of maintaining the stakepool + Ergo Fundation + maybe another wallet that we could use to vote on various project ideas etc (or whatever benefits the project - maybe even put it up for vote to the delegators)

Forwarded from eutxopool: I operate the EUTXO pool on Cardano.

The utility of the pool is to put out bounties for porting solutions between EUTXO chains out of pool fees, and I would like to use pool rewards to extend bounties on existing unsolved programming problems on EUTXO chains that don‚Äôt need porting.

I have checked a few of such grants that the Ergo Foundation has out. Does anyone have a reasonable idea in a PM/PO capacity as to how to ‚Äúbite-size‚Äù these, so that maybe I could more easily get interested devs involved? If that is feasible from the core devs‚Äô perspective I think it would make sense to do so.

I‚Äôm thinking a smaller mental commitment may make it easier to find experienced devs who are willing to commit when a few hundred ADA is involved as a reward.

Also if anyone has suggestions regarding bounties let me know and of course, all delegations are welcome and appreciated so that we can start building up the reward pot.

Looking at the pool results, looks like Sunday 8pm UTC is a good time to kick things off for a monthly Sigmanaut Zoom catch up.  

Will kick this off on the first Sunday of the month moving forward so first one next week. Link and reminder to be provided closer to the day üôÇ

Hey guys, is it okay if I update the subreddit description to match the current branding?

Current state:
Ergo, A Resilient Platform For Contractual Money.
Ergo builds advanced cryptographic features and radically new DeFi functionality on the rock-solid foundations laid by a decade of blockchain theory and development. ($ERG cryptocurrency)

Proposed state (copied from the ergo platform website):
Ergo, powering the future of finance.
Ergo is a next-generation smart contract platform that ensures the economic freedom of ordinary people through secure, accessible, and decentralized financial tools. ($ERG cryptocurrency)

Forwarded from Ergo Nation community: Welcome to the Ergo Nation community!

People can acquire decentralized on-chain identities by taking part in monthly events. Projects can ask ID holders to engage in governance, testing, whitelisting, rewarding contributions, etc. We can‚Äôt enforce any rules, but we encourage everyone to act in the spirit of the Ergo Manifesto. 

First event taking place on 7th of June 2022 at 20.00 UTC (instructions below) https://www.tickcounter.com/countdown/3284788/ergo-nation-verification-event

Rule #1: Do not reveal your ID address.

Rule #2: Do not reveal that you have an ID address.

Rule #3: Do not spam the chat. This is not a social club. Off topic messages will get you muted. 

Rule #4: I will make anonymous admins of all people who I can trust. Do not ask for it. 
 
Rule #5: This is a community organized group. Ergo Nation has no team. If you want to see improvements, then contribute with constructive discussion, work, or funding.

Well someone wants to get involved in an ambassador program anyway, and I like how the Sigmanaut program was formed and how it is currently handled to a degree.
Ef participation and very member inclusive, I find it hard to describe, I was thinking a status report for it with participation from all involved would be beneficial for the program.

Sigmanaut Onboarding
Welcome to the Sigmanaut training! This onboarding document will address some of the things we hope to accomplish and be a starting point for you to think how you might like to be more involved in the Ergo community.


[06/08/2022 8:29 PM] CW#0000
Lots of useful info on the pinned onboarding doc


[06/08/2022 8:31 PM] CW#0000
I need to learn how to use Notion, create a list so people can show what they're actively doing and others can check to help out it stop some overlap etc.

Can possible update before the monthly call and run through it there

@kushti is that dexy usd paper technical or economic design paper? If it is economic design, then I would be happy to give comments on the draft. 

I already wrote some ideas on the #dexygold channel. Not sure if you noticed.

he is doomed right?


[06/09/2022 8:33 PM] JOFLITO#0000
he sent ergs from Kucoin to an "ergo address" that in reality is a tron address


[06/09/2022 8:39 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
He is likely doomed yes


[06/09/2022 8:39 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
Damn


[06/09/2022 8:40 PM] Gstoiti#0000
I guess his only hope is Kucoin support


[06/09/2022 8:42 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
How was he able to do this? I thought it gave errors when the wrong address format was used, and could kucoin actually send to a Tron address for him? I always wondered this


[06/09/2022 8:43 PM] JOFLITO#0000
(re @Gazza_SP : *How was he able to do this? I thought it gave errors when the wrong address format was used, and could kucoin actually send to a Tron address for him? I always wondered this*) 
 
 I guesd they just send it to an ergo address that matches his tron one

(re @Gazza_SP : *How was he able to do this? I thought it gave errors when the wrong address format was used, and could kucoin actually send to a Tron address for him? I always wondered this*) 
 
 also he confirmed the mail lol


[06/09/2022 8:44 PM] crom#0000
yeah damn i didn't think kucoin allowed you to send unless it's a confirmed address


[06/09/2022 8:44 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
How did he get so many steps wrong though?

it probably got sent to that address

i don't have ERG to try but looks like it at least allows you past this screen with that address. i thought it doesn't even allow you past here without a confirmed address

If you can get information I'll bother them when they wake up.


[06/09/2022 8:57 PM] crom#0000
could we request Kucoin to do the whitelist thing with Ergo like they do with other chains? or is it something to do with the format of the address that allowed Tron to pass?

 shoot if I could open Kucoin right now I would just send an Erg out to that Tron address, don't they give a tx address like Coinex?


[06/10/2022 2:36 PM] glasgowm#0000
I‚Äôm guessing it fits the ergo address format and the other one doesnt. Looks like a SC address. Could you maybe generate one with that exact hash somehow?


[06/10/2022 2:38 PM] Gstoiti#0000
(re @glasgowm : *I‚Äôm guessing it fits the ergo address format and the other one doesnt. Looks like a SC address. Could you maybe generate one with that exact hash somehow?*) 
 
 If that would be possible, wouldn't that be a huge security risk for smart contracts?


[06/10/2022 2:38 PM] glasgowm#0000
how so?


[06/10/2022 2:39 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Because different people could generate the same address on purpose


[06/10/2022 2:39 PM] Gstoiti#0000
But I am just asking, have no idea üòÖ


[06/10/2022 2:40 PM] glasgowm#0000
oh right, well assuming it didn‚Äôt exist I meant. But probably not possible, not sure how they‚Äôre generated.


[06/10/2022 2:42 PM] Gstoiti#0000
I don't know about smart contract addresses either, but if one would know a way to generate (the keys for) a specific normal address on purpose, this person could basically steal all funds. I imagine one would face similar problems with sc addresses


[06/10/2022 2:50 PM] JOFLITO#0000
(re @Gstoiti : *I don't know about smart contract addresses either, but if one would know a way to generate (the keys for) a specific normal address on purpose, this person could basically steal all funds. I imagine one would face similar problems with sc addresses*) 
 
 It should be as hard as farming regular addresses


[06/10/2022 2:55 PM] glasgowm#0000
Those addresses are derived from your private key normally, so no risk. 

Looks like the SC ones are a base58 encoding of the script


[06/10/2022 2:55 PM] JOFLITO#0000
(re @C4lculista : *It should be as hard as farming regular addresses*) 
 
 @MrStahlfelge can you confirm sir?

(re @glasgowm : *Those addresses are derived from your private key normally, so no risk. 

Looks like the SC ones are a base58 encoding of the script*) 
 
 can you "uncode" base58?


[06/10/2022 2:56 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
yes the addresses can be converted back into the ergotree


[06/10/2022 2:57 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
there is no closed source on ergo. can't be as miners must launch the contracts


[06/10/2022 2:59 PM] JOFLITO#0000
(re @MrStahlfelge : *yes the addresses can be converted back into the ergotree*) 
 
 so someone could write a contract so it matches the "tron address"?


[06/10/2022 3:00 PM] JOFLITO#0000
(re @MrStahlfelge : *yes the addresses can be converted back into the ergotree*) 
 
 but public addresses cant be converted back to seed phrases


[06/10/2022 3:03 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
(re @C4lculista : *so someone could write a contract so it matches the "tron address"?*) 
 
 hard to match but you could try to get a funny address with a lot of effort


[06/10/2022 3:04 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
(re @C4lculista : *but public addresses cant be converted back to seed phrases*) 
 
 no, only to public key. that is the heart and core of cryptography, the public key can be used to validate signatures of the private key without knowledge of the private key


[06/10/2022 3:04 PM] JOFLITO#0000

Noah has been doing amazing voluntary work by mapping and welcoming new projects in Ergo. It is sad to see him lose money due to a mistake.

Such mistakes are inherent part of crypto. No authority can reverse transactions. We will need to keep educating people on the dangers, and promote good practices, like not trying new stuff with large wallets. That education will pay off, because same problems will be used for scams in the future.

Compensating mistakes as a community is dubious. However, acknowledging appreciation for Noah's work is not. If anyone ever felt like rewarding voluntary efforts in the community, now we know someone who could use it.

This is Noah's wallet. You can do with this info what you will.

 having syncing problems here just fyi. normally i can hard refresh the page, disconnect wallet, and make sure to disconnect within Nautilus as well - then reconnect.

when loading the site on the Ergo end i receive a message about Nami (and using the Cardano testnet), and Nami tries connecting just to let you know about that too

Latest on the bomb. 700k block delay pushing it to ~Sept

The following script predicts a ~0.08 second delay to block time by mid September 2022 and a ~0.6 second delay by November 2022. This gives reason to address because the effect will be seen, but not so much urgency we don't have space to work around if needed.

 What would be the thresholds for retweets? A tweet with 5k impressions might get retweeted only 20 times. Convincing 20 friends to retweet to game the system seems easy.

 this! adding a picture is an order of magnitude more engaging. If we can get some sigmanauts from the graphics side to do a refresh and unification of our info graphics to have familiar branding (inline witht he website?) will be really beneficial


[06/15/2022 4:38 PM] CW#0000
@AngieHar and i had a brief chat about promoted tweets on EP and I think it can the benefit for one or two a month. we used it quickly for the ergo meetup and targeted austin area directly and got reasonable engagement. 

opening that up to not be limited to geolocation can be big. 

In my opinion its wise to use it to bring awareness to GPU miners leading up to the Eth Merge (when ever that is). Might be of less benefit in other areas in the current market conditions

[06/15/2022 4:46 PM] CW#0000
sure, it was about 3k impressions for a niche subject (crypto) in a targeted specific location (Austin) and not a big budget spread over multiple days.

I think the best way to test whether the current bounties system is fair or not is basically to start attempting to reach those bounties on our end, and then after a week or so we can give our feedback on whether it was very easy/hard to get impressions/RTs or not


[06/15/2022 6:01 PM] curbsideprophetz#0000
Also depends on existing followers. If you have a large base it‚Äôs easier to hit those numbers than someone who just started and wants to contribute. But I guess if s/he committed enough they‚Äôll build it over time

 Yeah I also thought that It is very hard to reward based on impressions/RTs because someone with a very large follower base (im thinking of Jennie) can "easily" reach 5k impressions, but those 5k impressions could be always from the same 5k people that are already very into ERG so then It s not like a very profitable 5k impression in terms of expanding the erg word

But I do think it is a great idea and that needs testing to find the best bounties system

 Agreed. Earlier I alluded v1 this is fine for impressions and RT. But maybe v2 need more guard rails in place such as engagement metrics or weighted scoring based on followers

Regardless I will try for it doesn‚Äôt hurt to spread the word hah

 Depending on how active I am it‚Äòs about 1,5k to 5k impressions a day at average. 
‚Ä¢Good ones have more than 5k
‚Ä¢Very good ones have about 10-20k (once or twice a month)
‚Ä¢In the best month I gained about 220k impressions for all Tweets of this particular month

As I consider how difficult it is to actually get Erg to gain impressions based on my follower count and reviewing my 28 day stat's a strategy or guideline for those who sign up might be a good idea.
When I hashtag Cardano the impressions are higher I think, so who is the target audience that you want to get the impressions in front of?

Follower count does not mean a lot when you compare Tweets from now to Tweets from times in better market conditions. My best month with 220k impressions I had with just 400 Followers in a time when we didn‚Äôt have such markets ;)

 Yep this is a big consideration with promoting tweets. 

On the EP account, we are growing the follower count nicely but understandably 
noticed a decline in impressions over the last couple of weeks

Just tested it (bought my own nft on mainnet). First, I tried to use it on my pc browser, but I had problems scanning the second qr code for creating the box (my phone has a shit camera). Then I did everything on phone using the "open wallet" functionality and it worked fine. 

Would it be possible to display a text version of the qr code, which I could copy and paste into the wallet (additional option instead of scanning)? Then I could copy the code and send it to my phone, if I face such problems again.

Just thinking out loud here, if there is no plan for a date, maybe it would be good for the Sigmanauts to make a concerted effort on twitter to get it trending before the bounty is offered?
No shame in my game, I could tag a bunch of people and ask them to join in sometime, using Sigmaverse as a resource for people to pull from to promote projects, then it might look a bit more organic if there is a bounty to participate in the effort, make it look more like a fun thing for the 3 year anniversary rather anything else.

 Similar experience when I applied for the original /r/Ergo subreddit. Might actually try again now that it's been more than 3-4 weeks since I last applied. I just have to hope that the squatting mod hasn't done any mod activity recently, since that's literally what got my application rejected. :/

Forwarded from Ergo Nation Announcements: *Attention!*

Those of you who have been too busy/lazy to create new Œ£ID address and mix funds, now is your chance. 

We will help you to fast track the process.

This does not concern people who already have Œ£ID with mixed funds. If you are currently mixing, and worried that you dont have enough time, then you can take part. 

Create a new Œ£ID address right now. 

Create a new one-time-use Discord account with a one-time-use email.

If you know people who were interested, now is a chance to get in.

A friendly anon has loaded a faucet with ERG. 

1. Go to this website: https://ergofaucet.org/
2. Enter your new Œ£ID address. 
3. Pick ErgoNation from the "select asset".
4. Authenticate with the burner discord account.
5. You will get 0.1 ERG sent to your address.

Now you have the Œ£ID and funds ready for the Œ£ID verification event tomorrow. 

To avoid funds being drained fast, please
- Do not use the faucet more than once. 
- Do not announce this faucet in large groups. Only for those who might be interested.

(re @NoahErgo : *Seems like once ergo names and ergo nation come into maturity there will be natural synergy there*) 
 
 Could be. 

But since the Œ£ID point is to not stand out, a specific name is not that important. 

The anon part is experimental. It might be that just building rep publicly around ergo names address id is going to be more popular. 

Could also have both serving different use cases.


[07/10/2022 10:05 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
But yeah, waiting for that scale where good rep pays off might take quite a while.

Does anyone know if Is there is any information on how an exchange could list Ergo Native Tokens?


[07/16/2022 6:49 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
I'm pretty sure it's only a several day job compared to adding ERG, you would need to contact the exchange and request the information I think as it would still be different for each.


[07/16/2022 6:51 AM] CW#0000
Armeanio mentioned a couple of times about trying to negotiate a rate for listing Ergo native tokens. Not sure of the details though


[07/16/2022 6:54 AM] NoahErgo#0000
Coinex and gate.io are probably a good place to start


[07/16/2022 6:54 AM] NoahErgo#0000
But ya talking to joe and dan is probably smart


[07/16/2022 7:49 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
I thought exchanges use a enterprise setup for wallets and am hoping there is something available as a guide for them to refer to  - well something I could point them to anyway, I will ask Joe and Dan in coming days.


[07/16/2022 8:24 AM] LuivatraEP#0000
It is expensive though


[07/16/2022 10:18 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Afaik the exchanges use a special version of the node but their own integration into their system. This won't be able to handle tokens for now. When the first one is done, every other one is easy

(re @Haskell_plus : *I thought exchanges use a enterprise setup for wallets and am hoping there is something available as a guide for them to refer to  - well something I could point them to anyway, I will ask Joe and Dan in coming days.*) 
 
 you can try talk to Marty, there was some idea of getting a package deal at an exchange so the initial cost of implementation can be shared (for example ergopad/exle/neta). Not sure we have the cash for it though, we are tightening the belt to make sure we make it through the bear

 I am just exploring idea's, not sure a listing in a bear would do anyone any good, Exle has considered keeping things tight since during the IDO so I totally understand tightening the belt, I know cost's are nuts and as it is now there would not be funding for such a move.

I wonder if community chats in ergoplatform channel could be scheduled video chats to open up a timer for people to get the time right, myself I have to wrestle with CET GMT UTC WAT EST MST New Zealand and Australia times, am/pm, 24 hr etc. etc.
If we wanted to attract more participation in chats the timer would clearly let people know when to tune in.

Right, for the most part globally it is difficult to use, trust me I know, but the tool could be used as a timer to show something is happening at xx hours, then just turn the video chat off and go into the discussion

Did I miss anything @CW ?


[08/08/2022 12:00 AM] curbsideprophetz#0000
Do we have an example for the last bullet point ?


[08/08/2022 12:17 AM] Chris Ray#2713
From my own perspective sure:
Just as example of a community member that is doing good things,
SigamPrism on Twitter/youtube does cover Ergo in their content, however they have chosen to take a blockchain agnostic approach in their content,so while they do provide Ergo content it is possible that their work concerning other chains could influence others to ape away from Ergo and if holding title sigmanaut could have more weight in convincing others chain x is best route for let's just say "Oracles", although it could be debated (possibly) that Ergo is best option, however with a sigmanaut title if they made a statement as such x chain is better and community views them as trusted in sigmanaut position it could be detrimental to the program, and also to the growth of Ergo, a Sigmanaut goal is to increase awareness and education surrounding the ergo blockchain to increase growth and adoption of our ecosystem/community, promoting another chain can be detrimental to our growth and mission.


[08/08/2022 12:19 AM] Chris Ray#2713
My opinion is sigmanauts ought not funnel our community away from what we are doing in Ergo.


[08/08/2022 12:22 AM] Chris Ray#2713
I don't want to sound tribalistic or Erg maxi, but I do think the Sigmanaut program should be an ergo thing


[08/08/2022 12:23 AM] curbsideprophetz#0000
Nice thanks for clarifying and I would have to agree.

I also think though it would need to be case by case basis. Using myself as an example I have personal Twitter that promotes ergo, and run an ergo NFT account. I‚Äôm also working on Azorus which is chain agnostic (but ergo first). So in this case 33% of my efforts is ‚Äúfunneling away‚Äù that equity. 

So I think there may need to be some caveats but overall agree with your sentiment

 Definitely a rule that needs clear definitions and examples.

Like are mentions of BTC or Cardano on my Twitter profile a violation of this Ergo-centric standard? 

I personally think on a macro scale, Sigmanauts should be 100% Ergo-centric. I.e, Not promoting other chains, not creating content centered around other chains, etc. 

But on the micro scale we need to be careful to not be overly strict with this rule IMO.

What are your strengths and how can they be applied to the collective efforts of the community?

(re @TypoDaPsycho : *Like would my Twitter profile here be against Sigmanaut standards?*) 
 
 Yup and specifically for myself on Azorus we may be chain agnostic but at its core our activities are ergo first, ergo token eventually, IDO on ergopad, building data science tools for ergo, etc.

So I think answer will be it depends on individual especially if they have multiple personas


[08/08/2022 1:20 AM] Gstoiti#0000
Imo there is no problem when people which are active in the categories "community" or "creative" are talking about or promoting other chains and projects on their social media profiles or in non-Ergo groups. If someone helps community members (on telegram, twitter, reddit,...), creates Ergo content or e.g. moderates a (regional) group, then that's a contribution even if he talks about other chains in other groups or on other channels.

Afaik there are no benefits for sigmanauts other than this group and participating in sigmanaut votings. Hence, I think rules shouldn't be to restrictive. But that's just my opinion.

 The benefit of the Sigmanaut program may not be very apparent right now, the program is still new and still finding its direction based on the direction that the members and the Ergo Foundation would like to develop, however I believe that if ergo is to succeed in adoption and reaches the top 10 in marketcap the benefits will be very apparent as social channels become very busy and people seeking to contribute to development and adoption will need assistance in navigating the ecosystem.
I am directly opposed to your opinion that there is no problem in promoting other chains cause if a Sigmanaut is recognized as a source that is in some way supported by our community and ecosystem yet seeks to push the adoption of crypto in another direction to serve their own ambitions than they are not actually an ambassador for Ergo but are rather only participating in a selfish capacity for their own gain.
@curbsideprophetz and his Azorus project are a good example of the difficulties we need to sort though of what standards this program needs to define - and maybe myself and ErgoLend,  seeking to develop an agnostic cross-chain platform to serve a greater audience while also being ergo centric is a very difficult position to be in and I imagine it will become more difficult in the next Bull Market when community becomes more active and more conversation surrounding cross-chain ambitions is presen <clipped message>

P.S. @Gstoiti 
I kind of get the impression that you do not take the Sigmanaut program seriously and honestly would rather enjoy seeing you and anyone in such a position to resign from it.
Just being honest here.


[08/08/2022 4:57 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
I think it is a very much under utilized tool that the community would benefit from alongside the foundation.

(re @Haskell_plus : *P.S. @Gstoiti

 Sorry for the late response, I was asleep.

I am a part of the Ergo community, because I enjoy the values, principles and discussions of the community and Ergo developers and share some of the goals and visions proposed in the manifesto. However, imo Ergo (the blockchain) is only a tool to achieve them and it is not the only one. 

So for me there are in some sense two Ergo's,
1. the vision, values and goals,
2. the blockchain.

When I read e.g. the manifesto my impression is that the first one of these two is the important one and that the second one is a tool to achieve the first one. I try to promote 1. That's why I think talking about other chains as tools to achieve 1. is totally compatible with the Ergo spirit. 

I think Ergo's (in the sense of 2.) functionalities and technical design choices are very cool and I am happy to talk about them and help people understand them better, but they are not my main motivation.

Actually, I think some people act in a different way. They often talk about 1., but their main goal is to promote 2. That's also okay for me. I think one reason for that are financial incentives (they own a big bag of Erg). 

Full disclosure: I own just a few Erg atm. I entered the community, because of speculation, but now I think financial speculation with (in some sense) public infrastructure such as L1 coins used for paying transaction fees doesn't fit my personal values. That's why I only own a few negligible bags of L1 coins to actually use blockchains. That's one reason why reaching a top 10 market cap isn't important for me. Another one is that I think mcap is a bad measure for Ergo's (in the sense of 1. ) success.

If you and others thin <clipped message>


[08/08/2022 9:42 AM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
Not researching, testing, and discussing what exists and works on other chains is kneecapping ourselves. Most great tools and developments on ergo are ideas that have been taken from other chains. Imo at this early stage, sigmanauts should be able to experiment and be active in the crypto space in general, not having to hide this to retain a place in sigmanauts program. Have to be realistic also, many ergo projects are not able to support their devs. If someone chooses to help build a protocol elsewhere to be able to pay rent, that's fine by me. Nobody can say an echo chamber is good for building.

On top of that, good ergo devs active in other spaces is likely to bring more eyes to ergo than to take away, purely from the reasoning that ergo is smaller and hence any exposure is outside chains is likely to be given to an audience with a high % of non-ergo people. Those people then read manifesto, and they're ergonauts.

I see no reason to penalize anyone for interacting with other chains, they might be doing something interesting we can learn from and vice versa. We will just end up being ERG maxis blind to everything if we go down that path and that's not healthy at all. For example the UTXO alliance is still new and finding it's feet but I hope it brings something good for all projects involved in time. I guess I am also slightly biased here since we will be building on chains outside of ergo but I think it's a great opportunity to bring more people into the ergo ecosystem.


[08/08/2022 10:16 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Don't think you are biased. I am pretty uninterested in other chains and consider this a weakness on my side

that is rough lol


[08/13/2022 2:06 PM] glasgowm#9381
On previous discussion - see no problem with people being involved in other projects / chains while also a sigmanaut. Obviously there's a fine line; we had a similar issue before with Brodax (while not a sigmanaut) and each case would need to be tackled individually, but I trust us to stay on top of that. There's even a grouping in the sigmanauts for ambassadors to other chains (ie, someone like Ed Norris comes to mind who is a ONE ambassador but was previously very involved in ergo). So branching out and connecting will be a big part of our growth. If someones spewing daft unfounded stuff we can have a word with them / vote them out if required. But if other chains are better at certain tasks we want to hear all about it - and figure out how to slot erg in)

Not sure what the resignation comment is about - just based on his opinion on this? @Chris Ray


[08/13/2022 4:47 PM] Chris Ray#2713
I am sure I owe @Gstoiti an apology as I might have come off as a little too brash, not my intention sorry, and as CW would say: we are all equal here, yes it is just an opinion of mine that people probably ought to take the ambassador position maybe a little more seriously, I am going to be very honest here as i want to see this Sigmanaut program succeed and promote the growth of Ergo, hard to represent something fully if you are not 100% on board in its growth and put your time into representing something else, do I sound like a maxi? I am sure I do and that does not mean that I believe that Ergo has all the answers and other chains are bad, however, it is my strong opinion that a Sigmanaut even as ambassador to another chain should be held to a standard- and yes as @glasgowm has said this should be tackled individually, not blanket this program as it could restrict growth, the amazing impact that this Sigmanaut program has the potential to make is going to be diluted if not taking seriously and if it becomes stagnant than it will have been for naught - hell it could be viewed as just like a badge of community participation in the future and we could freely give it to some POS maxi's that also love Erg (I can name a few).
Anyhow, I do apologize @Gstoiti  and anyone else who I might have offended with my words.

 No need to apologize, having different opinions and expressing them is totally okay. 

I can see where you are coming from, but I also want to say that imo being part of other communities (for other chains) can lead to good opportunities for promoting Ergo and building off-chain bridges. E.g. I am in a few Cardano related German speaking groups with 100-200 members of which some also own Erg, but are not part of any Ergo groups. I can give them information about what already exists on Ergo, but not yet on Cardano  like SigUSD/Djed or other things like storage rent, the mixer, cold wallet functionality of the android wallet,...
When they need help (like how to use ErgoDex/Spectrum or what wallets exist) or information about something they usually tag me. If I didn't care about Cardano and DeFi on Cardano I wouldn't have been invited to some of those groups. 

Another good example is Conceal (CCX). Without Ergo community members promoting Ergo in their groups and voting for Ergo in their discord, they probably wouldn't build a bridge to Ergo, but to some other chain.

Just to make it clear, for me promotion is helping people and informing/discussing about features and events, but always in a honest and realistic way. Promotion like tweets about unrealistic (from my point of view) price predictions or advertisement sentences like "...if you don't own #ERG do you even #crypto?" (I hope it's okay <clipped message>

 i think this is irrelevant , they only use bids because skyharbor doesn't have bids and it's a good way to see how much people will actually pay for your art.

I thought someone mentioned it before but I could be wrong, I will retract that statement as I have no idea if it's true


[08/15/2022 4:19 PM] koutelier#0000
if you know how to code you can mint. or there is an open source git with a minting procedure but doesn't support royalties


[08/15/2022 4:19 PM] glasgowm#0000
its just that anyone using his minter/backend has to


[08/15/2022 4:20 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @glasgowm : *its just that anyone using his minter/backend has to*) 
 
 no backend in this current auction house version


[08/15/2022 4:20 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
(re @glasgowm : *its just that anyone using his minter/backend has to*) 
 
 Probably what I'm thinking of


[08/15/2022 4:20 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @glasgowm : *its just that anyone using his minter/backend has to*) 
 
 also the minter is free i believe, only fees from listing in the auction house. also the new minter will be free as well .

 Minting is not the problem, there's also the ergopay example minter. Uploading to ipfs is the more complex part, complex as needs some hours to be done.

I understand. What i meant is that barely no one else will integrate the flag into minters, because the flag is just an auction house flag. When sky harbor respects the flag, it is nice - but the flag is nothing but some information.


[08/15/2022 4:38 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
I think, even though AH holds a dear place in my heart, you all make valid points. I've seen a lot of newcomers lose a lot of ERG bidding on fake NFTs. I believe the lack of addressing this for so long is what give me pause in contributing more than a few ERGs to the cause. If funds are coming from community, then protecting/educating users to things like this is important. Also making yourself available to listen and address these concerns should be required, IMHO

 well if they don't they will lose a great amount of artists . i think everyone from now will have to integrate that


[08/15/2022 4:53 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Not necessarily. I can build you a nice transaction builder to buy NFT from auction house without the artist royalty. 
It is just not very interesting to do that because it would just mean the seller gets more.

 royalty is not even part of the ah smart contract? I figured it was enforce on the AH but not everywhere on ergo

[08/15/2022 4:56 PM] koutelier#0000

 It can't get checked safely because the minting box is usually spent

(re @koutelier : *wait so if you want you can buy nfts without royalties . i though that was part of a smart contract not build in the FE*) 
 
 It is not part of a contract. to enforce it the NFT would need to be secured by a contract its whole lifetime. That could be implemented, but would mean to never store it on a p2pk address. As soon as it is on p2pk, it is owned by the owner without any restrictions. And that means without any artist fees.

 if royalties was inside the metadata wouldn't that be more "secure"


[08/15/2022 5:03 PM] koutelier#0000
like a Standard?


[08/15/2022 5:06 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Only a smart contract can really secure it. And there are contracts to ensure that a token will always be secured by this contract. But the buyers would feel as if they would not really own the token - which would be true


[08/15/2022 6:10 PM] koutelier#5178
I want that üëÄ


[08/15/2022 6:36 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Isn't the situation on Cardano similar? Afaik there exists a royalty metadata standard, but since nfts are native assets and not smart contracts like on Ethereum, those standards can't be enforced. Only a matter of time until "black markets" which ignore royalties will pop up. Obviously, sellers or buyers depending on who "gets" the royalties will prefer those over normal market places.


[08/15/2022 6:42 PM] koutelier#0000

Feels like more and more people are slowly waking up to the fact that NFT royalties are not *enforced* at a smart contract level and it's on exchanges to opt-in ... what's going to be the new equilibrium here?

1/ The fact that it's not enforceable hints at sometime important, it's not capturing something meaningful, it doesn't build the right economical ontology.

 Would it be possible to somehow enforce (some new eip type?) That a token can only be sent to one particular address?

That address would be an escrow type contract, where seller can change the price.

The token would be in wallet, but transfer would always have to be through the contract.

But maybe some intermediate solution is to just give a budget let you guys figure it out the breakdown etc and plug Anastasia our treasurer in for reward distribution.

[08/16/2022 5:36 AM] Armeanio#0000

[08/16/2022 9:17 AM] koutelier#5178
I work at the moment but basically sigmanauts could build a platform and charge fees that will go to sigmanauts treasury to hire people for marketing purposes


[08/16/2022 9:18 AM] koutelier#5178
I wanted to build a platform like sketch fab for people to list their 3d models for free or for ergs


[08/16/2022 9:19 AM] koutelier#5178
Sigmanauts have a lot of devs that can contribute to this and then the fees from the platform could go to treasury


[08/16/2022 9:20 AM] koutelier#5178
Then with that money we could do a much better work shilling ergo . Not pay ourself though I am against of that . Only if people really deserve and everyone votes for it


[08/16/2022 9:21 AM] koutelier#5178
Let me know if you like that idea


[08/16/2022 9:23 AM] koutelier#5178
This platform won‚Äôt be affiliated with EF and the treasury address will be off course public for all to review . It would be even better if we have a multisig wallet so we are 100 sure the funds are safe not that I don‚Äôt trust sigmanauts but people outside ergo maybe not

Lets chat! Community AMA. Today we have Kushti, Marty from ErgoPad and Chris Ray from Exle (Ergolend). Welcome guys!

I might start by saying it was amazing to see the video posted of the impact one of the first Exle microfinance loans has made in Kenya.

[08/16/2022 2:06 PM] koutelier#0000
Yeah let me know what do you think about it . I will do it anyway if you don‚Äôt agree but if you all agree then we can develop it all together and set a 2% for treasury


[08/16/2022 2:07 PM] koutelier#0000
Then we can vote on how this will be spent


[08/16/2022 2:07 PM] koutelier#0000
I don‚Äôt expect big income but still better than nothing and as ergo grows this will too

 You need to promote them to admin and then set the title there

 Not sure how much demand there would be for this, how many people have 3d printers? Maybe could be done via AH/SH


[08/16/2022 2:23 PM] koutelier#0000
Not only 3d print files . Blitz could use models . Or spooky. A section for the valley .


[08/16/2022 2:24 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @glasgowm : *Not sure how much demand there would be for this, how many people have 3d printers? Maybe could be done via AH/SH*) 
 
 Because if you mint a 3d model people can right click and download


[08/16/2022 2:25 PM] glasgowm#0000
They could download a picture, nft would let them redeem a high res version


[08/16/2022 2:26 PM] koutelier#0000

yeah there‚Äôs a handful of ppl but enough to build a marketplace from scratch idk


[08/16/2022 2:34 PM] koutelier#0000
I don‚Äôt know if they are on ergo atm. But long term if we all believe in ergo people will come


[08/16/2022 2:35 PM] koutelier#0000
We can even use it as marketing . Print your ergo breloc or phone case or vase . Whatever creators do


[08/16/2022 2:37 PM] koutelier#0000
Make few Reddit post maybe . I don‚Äôt really know if this is going to be successful but I believe it will be


[08/16/2022 2:57 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
I think if this was included as part of a larger marketplace for IRL goods it would have more traffic.  I know there has been some demand for apparel, posters of NFTs, etc.

[08/17/2022 4:16 PM] Armeanio#0000
Proposed a vote for sigmanaut funding it looks like it will pass. Still a few needed. 

Moves around things in house , I wanted to try to make it a cost neutral thing for the EF. 

Hopefully as conditions improve longer term we can scale this a bit for some better incentives. But it looks like the initial funding proposal will pass.

 You should check the sigmanauts discord theres more channels there for specific focuses

branding, moderation, etc.


[08/17/2022 4:25 PM] koutelier#0000

[08/17/2022 4:28 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *You should check the sigmanauts discord theres more channels there for specific focuses*) 
 
 Yeah I checked . Still haven‚Äôt had the time to check everything . I saw the forms about task I will check if I can contribute somewhere . 
 FYI. 
-I can do some light coding (JavaScript) light coding or copy code and modify lol 

- 3d designs 

-people say to me I do good on marketing propositions(don‚Äôt know about that honestly)


[08/17/2022 4:29 PM] koutelier#0000
So if you need any help feel free


[08/17/2022 4:29 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
I know that the program is a wip...been trying to go over past topics and convo as I get acquainted...Seems that organization and funding are two big things RN, is the correct?


[08/17/2022 4:30 PM] glasgowm#0000
I imagine organisation will always be a big part, but should certainly improve heh. And yeah funding currently under vote from the EF. Eventually hopefully self-funded via DAOs


[08/17/2022 4:32 PM] glasgowm#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *Financial incentives help retention but should not be driving force*) 
 
 they also help growth, and are good-value for money. I think we should catch most grifters in the screening process.


[08/17/2022 4:32 PM] koutelier#0000
About funding I think the best thing would be sigmanauts to be non affiliated with EF . Build something that will keep the program going and then daos for member payments if they work(because I believe not all sigmanauts are active all the time )  or other expenses


[08/17/2022 4:34 PM] glasgowm#0000
Ideally it should replace EF, and inactive members pruned like an organisation (or cluster of orgs)


[08/17/2022 4:35 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Some examples of things I have been working on over last year:

Sigmaverse growth, seeking new projects

Dev outreach to foster community dev and seeking new devs from cardano eco

Put together a spreadsheet for exle pilot program

Small things with ergo docs like apis

Communicating with DeCo a lot to try to help build their program


[08/17/2022 4:35 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I think DeCo really could use our help


[08/17/2022 4:37 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
What type of things does DeCo need?


[08/17/2022 4:37 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Well they are currently trying to reformat course work into a written lesson program and they said they would be open to help with it


[08/17/2022 4:38 PM] NoahErgo#0000
so worth heading to DeCo dicord if you want to help, Keith asked to hit him up in the hallway channel


[08/17/2022 4:38 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
Perfect. Ill head over there and see if I am able to assist in any way


[08/17/2022 4:39 PM] NoahErgo#0000

[08/17/2022 4:39 PM] koutelier#0000

[08/17/2022 4:39 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I think you could be useful in other ways if you dont feel confident there


[08/17/2022 4:39 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Spreading the word of the program too


[08/17/2022 4:40 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Still worth hitting up keith offering to help


[08/17/2022 4:40 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
Whats his username?


[08/17/2022 4:41 PM] NoahErgo#0000
@kii


[08/17/2022 4:41 PM] NoahErgo#0000
With a symbol


[08/17/2022 4:45 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
Would it be worth having a dedicated domain for the program? Was thinking at the least it could help spread awareness about it.


[08/17/2022 4:45 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
Took me a while to find out about it, and still trying to grasp everything about it


[08/17/2022 4:46 PM] koutelier#0000
A fronted would be nice . Add what the project does . Forms for applying . What sigmanauts have achieved etc etc


[08/17/2022 4:47 PM] koutelier#0000
If sigmanauts  roadmap is to replace EF for sure needs a website imo


[08/17/2022 4:47 PM] NoahErgo#0000
There are many plans for DeCo including website


[08/17/2022 4:47 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
Just didn't know if it was discussed yet


[08/17/2022 4:47 PM] koutelier#0000
Oh you where talking about deco sorry hehe


[08/17/2022 4:47 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
@NoahErgo, was talking about the Sigmanaut program


[08/17/2022 4:47 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Oh i see


[08/17/2022 4:47 PM] koutelier#0000
Sigmanauts needs one also ü§£


[08/17/2022 4:48 PM] glasgowm#0000
That is the long term goal, but not a priority atm


[08/17/2022 4:48 PM] koutelier#0000
Yeah with proper forms for sigmanauts to apply . Or for sigcans


[08/17/2022 4:48 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
I thought I saw something about bringing more awareness to it when I was going over stuff

 regarding the ergo website .I think wallets need a different section . New comers ask about this a lot


[08/17/2022 4:50 PM] koutelier#0000
Too lazy to even read on how to get erg


[08/17/2022 4:50 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
Yeah, I saw it on the Ergo site, Kinda gets lost in the sauce with all the other great content on there, which is why I was curious. Could be a good central place to have all of the docs & info abut it as well once things are more ironed out.


[08/17/2022 4:51 PM] glasgowm#0000

Deco material ?


[08/17/2022 6:59 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Not a bad idea eventually but i think first need to get english version solidifed


[08/17/2022 7:01 PM] CW#0000
One way to contribute, breaks down the barrier for adoption. As noah mentioned there's still a fair bit to work on there first


[08/17/2022 7:02 PM] koutelier#0000
Well I could help slowly if needed . But translation takes a lot of time lol


[08/17/2022 7:02 PM] CW#0000
Yup


[08/17/2022 7:05 PM] CW#0000
What id like to see built over time is wiki style documentation for ergoscript. Eg a function, description then small example


[08/17/2022 7:06 PM] CW#0000
That then ties into tutorials, dapp examples etc


[08/17/2022 7:06 PM] koutelier#0000
The only ‚Äúproblem‚Äù I can think it is that I in few areas I will need guidance because you can‚Äôt translate properly what you can understand

 Was just thinking a sigmanaut based subpool could be interesting.  Miners would mine to support a treasury.  The pool would in return issue governance tokens that allow those who contributed to the fund to vote on proposals issued by sigmanaut including payment to members.

 What is the process of making a subpool?


[08/19/2022 12:23 AM] NoahErgo#0000
Is it decentralized so anybody can make like on spectrum or is it through you guys

(re @NoahErgo : *Is it decentralized so anybody can make like on spectrum or is it through you guys*) 
 
 Right now it is through us.  We have plans to launch user based subpools where one can create their own similar to ergodex.  However, we also have new focus on building a fully decentralized mining platform so that may take priority.   Working through an updated roadmap now.

 a token just so people mine it  ? how we will provide liquidity or keep the value of the token

what value, it is a government token IIRC

[08/19/2022 7:53 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Mine Erg. Get Sigmanaut token instead of Erg. Erg goes to DAO treasury. Sigmanauts make proposal. Sigmanaut holders vote them up or down, including over how Treasury Erg is spent.


[08/19/2022 7:54 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Vote presumably proportional to tokens held, tiers or variations.

 I am wondering too.

Is there a financial incentive for miners? If not, then why not just donate directly?

Also, what is the advantage of wealth weighted voting compared to 1 person 1 vote?


[08/19/2022 9:12 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
there is a comet pool, isn't it used?


[08/19/2022 9:13 AM] koutelier#0000
(re @MrStahlfelge : *there is a comet pool, isn't it used?*) 
 
 Not much .


[08/19/2022 9:13 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
but a little. and a government token is more valuable than comet, isn't it


[08/19/2022 9:13 AM] koutelier#0000
The rewards are not so high for them . Neta offered more and ergopad is a hold coin so no point of using comet


[08/19/2022 9:14 AM] koutelier#0000
(re @MrStahlfelge : *but a little. and a government token is more valuable than comet, isn't it*) 
 
 Valuable in terms of $$?


[08/19/2022 9:16 AM] koutelier#0000
Miners won‚Äôt care about government token sir because this token Won‚Äôt pay their bills


[08/19/2022 9:17 AM] koutelier#0000
So if they had to choose between comet pool and sigmaut pool I believe they would choose comets pool because there they would earn ergs plus comet . So they swap that and pay their bills


[08/19/2022 9:17 AM] koutelier#0000
Also this will give ‚Äúpower‚Äù to miners only and our community is not just miners .


[08/19/2022 9:18 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
that is the problem with all mining based votes


[08/19/2022 9:20 AM] koutelier#0000
There are solutions to that but my point is a token just to fund sigmanauts is not a great idea Imo


[08/19/2022 9:21 AM] koutelier#0000
Creating a platform that people will actually use and the fees goes to sigmanauts program is the way to go


[08/19/2022 9:21 AM] koutelier#0000
We can implement there a dao token


[08/19/2022 9:22 AM] koutelier#0000
Then sigmanauts and community can vote for various things


[08/19/2022 9:23 AM] koutelier#0000
(re @MrStahlfelge : *that is the problem with all mining based votes*) 
 
 The problem is not only the voting system . The main problem is they won‚Äôt actually make profits so they won‚Äôt use the pool . The voting could be fixed with staking


[08/19/2022 9:27 AM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
Why should sigmanaut activity be profitable?


[08/19/2022 9:30 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
the profit is getting a vote.

 So you would pay electricity without making money just to vote on sigmanauts polls ?


[08/19/2022 9:33 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I would not as I don't like the sound of fans, but maybe others would


[08/19/2022 9:33 AM] koutelier#0000
So why not create a token and let people buy it so they can vote?

that's the same


[08/19/2022 9:46 AM] koutelier#0000
I don‚Äôt find that a great idea then . I would suggest sigmanauts to create a platform for providing services and adding a small fee for treasury and giving back government token to the users that use the services

 unless i understood that wrong, you want miners to mine and give the ergs to sigmanauts and have the right to vote in things sigmanauts propose ?

Or a %


[08/19/2022 11:25 AM] koutelier#0000
either way miners are researching for ways to earn as much as they can imo @Arohbe knows more . i don't think this is a good strategy


[08/19/2022 11:25 AM] Gazza_SP#0000
I do like the idea but the issue is that in my opinion most miners won't be willing to take that cut as mining is already pretty unprofitable in this market so losing more funds won't appeal to many


[08/19/2022 11:25 AM] Gazza_SP#0000
In a better market it could work though

(re @glasgowm : *Maybe if we put our heads together we can do more than one thing*) 
 
 first we need to do some research, think the % would be fair. and maybe ask for projects to donate tokens as well


[08/19/2022 11:33 AM] koutelier#0000
so we give ergs plus tokens


[08/19/2022 11:33 AM] koutelier#0000
this could attract more people


[08/19/2022 11:34 AM] koutelier#0000
and help projects to fair distribute their tokens


[08/19/2022 11:34 AM] koutelier#0000
so a pool that will takes 2% fees from the pool and give back ergs + ergopad, comet, egio, THz etc etc


[08/19/2022 11:35 AM] koutelier#0000
in a safe way so we don't drive the price of the tokens down


[08/19/2022 11:35 AM] koutelier#0000
also the tokens we will receive we will have to burn them not swap them


[08/19/2022 11:35 AM] koutelier#0000
because the way a subpool works atm is that you earn a % from everything


[08/19/2022 11:36 AM] koutelier#0000
to solve the problem about how the community can vote , we could add some ergs to a pool on spectrum and let miners swap our tokens there. so people can buy that .


[08/19/2022 11:36 AM] koutelier#0000
and vote


[08/19/2022 11:46 AM] glasgowm#0000
sounds good


[08/19/2022 11:47 AM] koutelier#0000
i would even give less tokens than other subpools give so we don't have any conflict .also receiving a great variety of tokens plus $ERG will make that sub pool the most used one i think


[08/19/2022 11:50 AM] crandano#0000
i wonder if a governance token is the correct way to go. what if your vote, as a miner, is weighted by how long you've participated in the pool where a % is going to the Sigmanaut Treasury? instead of a token, whoever is in that pool can cast a vote (perhaps partially weighted by hashpower and weighted by duration of participation in the pool)

 this drives to 2 different problems. miners will not have proper profits , people that don't mine they don't have voice

(re @koutelier : *this drives to 2 different problems. miners will not have proper profits , people that don't mine they don't have voice*) 
 
 One probably doesn't want that miners who are only focused on profit vote, imo we want people who care about more than profit to vote. 

Second problem can be solved through other mechanisms for other people


[08/19/2022 11:58 AM] koutelier#0000
it's not profit voting. miners need profit to pay their bills.


[08/19/2022 12:00 PM] crandano#0000
a problem i see with governance tokens could be speculation on price / future value - where what we want, i'd assume, is just a simple way to give people the option to vote on how the Sigmanaut Treasury is handled


[08/19/2022 12:04 PM] Gstoiti#0000
(re @koutelier : *it's not profit voting. miners need profit to pay their bills.*) 
 
 That's not true. There are miners who would accept to lose money if they are allowed to participate in governance. Those are the people who value the ecosystem and hence, also value to govern and decide. Those are the people one wants to govern.


[08/19/2022 12:04 PM] koutelier#0000
so let's do and see ?


[08/19/2022 12:58 PM] Arohbe#0000
I was thinking more of a % fee would come out and the miner would still earn a majority portion of their general reward.   I do think that miners interested in supporting the community are out there and will support.   There are many creative ways to get miners interested.  For example. We have NFT artists in the sigmanauts.   Can have a lottery or something for the miners that contribute.   As for the non-miners.  Miners could create a market for these tokens and trade them to others interested in voting.  In order to maintain control of consensus.  One token can be one vote.   So the largest token holder cannot control the vote.  Probably a lot more to solve but a lot of smart people here.


[08/19/2022 2:17 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
I think the discussion should start on what we want to achieve.

Sigmanaut treasury to support Sigmanaut cobtributions? Or community cobtributions?

Should the money come from EF, donations, or for-profit activities?

Who should get to decide? Biggest bags, Sigmanauts or the whole community?

What is the general aim for spending the funds? Building tools? Research? Marketing? Content? I guess this is what the voting is about, but a general direction would help to design the system.

All these questions are unclear to me. Discussing the practical issues like distribution does not make sense before discussing the goals imo. Maybe I missed some part.


[08/19/2022 2:20 PM] glasgowm#0000
community funded long term, but bootstrapped by EF (and if it‚Äôs successful enough - more donations/hiring from EF later as the Sigmanauts start doing more)


[08/19/2022 2:23 PM] glasgowm#0000
> Who should get to decide? Biggest bags, Sigmanauts or the whole community?

can‚Äôt involve the whole community in every small decision - maybe for larger ones and grant requests eventually like catalyst. 

But for now sigmanauts 1 vote each, and accounting for inactivity somehow

> What is the general aim for spending the funds? Building tools? Research? Marketing? Content? I guess this is what the voting is about, but a general direction would help to design the system.

Can be anything eventually, hopefully lots of types of DAOs spring up or split from this. Community marketing is the most effective bit we can use cash on IMO - and fairly broad.


[08/19/2022 2:25 PM] glasgowm#0000
(re @Ile : *Community funded with donations, or by selling smth?*) 
 
 Either; raffles, direct donations. Maybe ecosystem projects would eventually set a % of their distribution and in return get marketing services and community support (and critique ;)).

Yeah I just think the subpool thing is a decent idea in general and we could figure out how to get it work. Hopefully low incentives for abuse would help. Or could the subpool maybe allow the miner to set the % manually in the config?

 The % would need to be consistent. Possibly variable with some work but would have to see.  However, it‚Äôs easy for a miner to switch pools if they want to stop contributing.

 It is interesting, but any gov token is in conflict with 1 vote per active sigmanaut. Unless its some bicameral system.

The perks could be something else too, like marketing services as you mention. This would just make the role of sigmanauts ambiguous. Somehow owing favors to projects, while being ecosystem authority.

Those allegiances get messy fast, as we just saw with ef being dragged to aneta mess. But maybe that is just the job for Sigmanauts, so that ef does not have to. Be the messy layer between ecosystem ideals and promoting projects.

 Note it wouldn‚Äôt neccessarily need to be direct-marketing. Projects could donate and then it could be used for general ergo marketing, editorial reviews, code audits, etc.

(re @glasgowm : *Either; raffles, direct donations. Maybe ecosystem projects would eventually set a % of their distribution and in return get marketing services and community support (and critique ;)).*) 
 
 I really think promoting a culture where projects put small % of profits to ecosystem would be good.

Like a voluntary tax to fund public goods, research, marketing, etc. Projects could pick the targets themselves or delegate it to Sigmanaut treasury for example. 

Saying tax, and more fees sounds bad at face value. However, those public goods especially can push an ecosystem forward. Other chains do that with VC money or Cardano catalyst type things.

For projects, it would be a marketing expense. More fees than competitor, but maybe more users who value the commitment to the ecosystem.

Btw who else has a sigusd key and what is the requirement for changes? Do all key holders have to agree? What can be changed? I think these are important questions for protocol users and should be mentioned on the website.

So just for clarification, few questions.


[08/19/2022 8:13 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
1. Where is the Sigmanaut funding coming from?


[08/19/2022 8:13 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
2. Will the funding be used via vote?


[08/19/2022 8:13 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
3. How will what we use it for be decided? A brainstorm of sorts?


[08/19/2022 8:14 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
4. Let's say we vote on using it for marketing. How do we choose which avenue that marketing takes place. Ie; twitter promotion, influencer promotion, etc etc.


[08/19/2022 8:15 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385

Just one point about profitability. One thing the Sigmanaut program accomplishes is to help make connections within the community. So, a project that a Sigmanaut helped might be willing to contribute tokens to the Sigmanaut program from their Advisor Fund.


[08/19/2022 9:57 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Funny, most of the projects I'm thinking of are actually run by Sigmanauts, probably not a hard sell.


[08/19/2022 10:01 PM] koutelier#0000
I wouldn‚Äôt mess with tokens tbh unless sigmanauts find a way of to pay  with them.  Also helping = free . If you help you can‚Äôt ask for money after


[08/19/2022 10:02 PM] koutelier#0000
It‚Äôs like making sigmanauts influencers . I can arrange someone with this guy but I need few tokens . Or I can promote you but contribute to the sigmanauts program

(re @koutelier : *It‚Äôs like making sigmanauts influencers . I can arrange someone with this guy but I need few tokens . Or I can promote you but contribute to the sigmanauts program*) 
 
 I agree that it could lead to this impression and I don't like when sigmanauts act like influencers/advertisers. 

For me the cleanest way would be to formulate goals like a mission statement and ask for anonymous donations. That probably would not lead to a lot money, but I also don't know why we would need a lot ü§î

For marketing which is probably the most expensive task I would just create a concept and a raffle to fund it.


[08/19/2022 10:28 PM] koutelier#0000
For me the cleanest way is for sigmanauts build something. Use ergo tools and experience and get money from fees . They are huge minds in sigmanauts group . We can all think and work together on something for ergo shakes. Donating and ‚Äúbegging‚Äù eventually will create conflicts . Also sigmanauts need to have the first word and not ask the whole community for every decision . Community members can join sigmanauts program after all if sigamaunts believe they worth it


[08/19/2022 10:30 PM] koutelier#0000
Building is better than raffles and donations IMO a platform or a dapp that people will actually use and appreciate .


[08/19/2022 10:34 PM] koutelier#0000
Because always people will have different opinions. Why you spend that on this , you shouldn‚Äôt . I have the right I donate money . If you are not lean on other you can do whatever you want with the treasury . Pay sigmanauts that work extremely hard. Pay for marketing that sigmanauts think deserves it etc etc .

You're opinionated, and I like that. But, as the Shakespeare quote goes, "There are more things in heaven and earth,¬†Horatio, than are dreamt of in your¬†philosophy." There are many ways to approach projects. 

For example, I've cleaned up readmes, written short marketing pieces, and written other pieces. And, when people are appreciative and want to pay me, I could direct them to the Sigmanaut treasury. I can think of at least one instance where I would have done that. Outside of the Ergo Foundation, which has a $20/150 published word pay scale, I've never asked for tokens or money up-front, and I can do that because I don't do it for the tokens.

There are other ideas. Fundraising off whales and projects is obvious. Developing a business creates different incentives than promoting the ecosystem, and personally, I don't want to do that.

[08/20/2022 6:39 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Another example that occurs to me, people could deposit Ergopad whitelist tokens for projects that exceed the amount they are buying. It gets put into a contract, and people could request them with some kind of fee, using a variation of the escrow contract from Tokenjay. It would help serve as a clearing house for extra tokens, which could then be burned after the sale is over and earn some Erg for the treasury.


[08/20/2022 6:40 AM] cafebedouin#9837
People will do it because managing p2p sales is a pain in the ass. Once it gets off the ground, you could probably even provide incentives for making deposits. Marty wouldn't care because it would help the projects on Ergopad to sell out.


[08/20/2022 6:43 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Also, I do one card mining. I don't think it would be a big deal to change the deposit address to the Sigmanaut treasury. I'd bet there are others that would do the same.


[08/20/2022 6:45 AM] cafebedouin#9837
The way to do this, in my humble opinion, is to do it with small efforts, "Fish and bread keeps a poor man fed." I mean, what exactly does the Sigmanaut program need a Treasury for? There's a lot that could be done, but realistically, the real value of the program is the skills people are bringing to it.

Hmm some very good points I hadn't thought about being shared, having a Sigmanaut Treasury would be nice in some aspects but idk if it would be manageable until further tooling is set up like DAOs. On the raffle idea, I'm not opposed to it but I personally think we'd have the most success if we put together a marketing pitch and had good/unique marketing materials to show. And imo only doing the raffle a few times a year, maybe 4 would be best. Less annoying and easier to manage as a group. But now I just realized, if I don't think we're ready for a Treasury, what makes me think we're ready for funding from raffles  üòÇ

Incentives can be tweaked, so let me know if this seems reasonable. 

Impressions are hard to verify, was thinking of swapping it for retweets? Or any other ideas?*) 
 
 For Twitter we currently have this rough structure (along with the contributors programme).

Wouldn‚Äôt neccessarily have to be bounties either and could be things like topping up any raffles deemed worthy, running competitions, commissioning artwork, smaller grant requests, etc. 

We need to spend on marketing anyway, but I think this group could come up with some more effective ways than us hiring ‚Äòoutsiders‚Äô or marketing firms. (Especially as we have loads of marketers in the programme itself). 

Getting some funding would just be to get some autonomy and start trying things out. 

Maybe a shared gDoc would be best to iron these things out?

[08/22/2022 1:09 PM] glasgowm#0000
~100 retweets gets us 20k impressions, or 200 impressions per retweet. bounties at $1 per retweet could be a good starting point.

Guys since I started doing most of the frontend for night owl I can't really find the time to do "Sigmanaut things" aside from the basic spanish chat moderation aka kicking some bots and some people insulting.

Ergo spanish Twitter acc is inactive, I also stopped doing translations to spanish.

(re @seedubya : *The sigmanauts aren't here to manipulate their own tweets for revenue, nor manipulate any incentive for that matter. 

Standards and accountability, we (as all sigmanauts) will see if that's happening. 

It's also up to the individual if they wish to claim an incentive. I won't be doing so*) 
 
 I though put bounties for all to claim .


[08/22/2022 1:44 PM] koutelier#0000
I have no doubts for sigmanauts off course


[08/22/2022 1:45 PM] koutelier#0000
I thought that Glasgow meant to spread that whoever does it will get the bounty . My bad


[08/22/2022 1:47 PM] glasgowm#0000
Sigmanauts and maybe SIGCANs - can see how it goes from there and how robust we can make it.


[08/22/2022 1:47 PM] koutelier#0000
Okay I agree to that . Sorry üòÜ

@C4lculista maybe you could get some retweets if you use the spanish ergo twitter acc

Or some other trust worthy spanish speaker


[08/22/2022 1:51 PM] glasgowm#0000
Most influencers are not really worth the cost IMO. The prices are crazy and unclear how much value they bring.

I would be more keen to target certain high-quality influencers who are also really good at explaining things.

Anybody interested in helping me manage sigmaverse? @Rishabh I know you mentioned this. I can get you an admin account.

Basically have to go through and reupload all the images/logos for many entries because they became corrupted. And then also have to finish re-adding projects for mining, wallets, dev tools


[08/22/2022 3:17 PM] NoahErgo#4349
I usually do this stuff myself but having another person to help would be really great have been very busy with my personal life and can only sit down to work on it once or twice a week

-How setup cold wallet function with the video link .
-Ergo wallets
-exchanges
-etc


[08/22/2022 4:50 PM] koutelier#0000
Then /faq and it will drop the links


[08/22/2022 4:51 PM] koutelier#0000
I can modify ergopads bot I believe

 Better to have all in one command


[08/22/2022 4:54 PM] koutelier#0000
And drops links for website and tutorial links


[08/22/2022 4:54 PM] koutelier#0000
Then /socials

[08/22/2022 4:54 PM] koutelier#0000

[08/22/2022 4:55 PM] koutelier#0000
We need prices as well? ü§£


[08/22/2022 4:55 PM] NoahErgo#0000
No


[08/22/2022 4:55 PM] koutelier#0000
Jk they will spam the hell out of it haha


[08/22/2022 4:55 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Could do it in the trade channel though maybe like something that returns prices for erg, ergopad, comet, neta, etc.


[08/22/2022 4:56 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *Could do it in the trade channel though maybe like something that returns prices for erg, ergopad, comet, neta, etc.*) 
 
 I can do it for sure . I will run ergopads api and list everything there


[08/22/2022 4:56 PM] koutelier#0000
But need to be two different bots because the command will work on the main channel as well


[08/22/2022 4:57 PM] koutelier#0000
Everything ergopad has (in price apis) we can do it . Or else we need to use spectrum api but we have to do some math in order to get the price in $


[08/22/2022 5:10 PM] LuivatraEP#0000
good thing about ergopad bot is that it has a 30m cooldown on price


[08/22/2022 5:10 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @LuivatraEP : *good thing about ergopad bot is that it has a 30m cooldown on price*) 
 
 I ditched that for comet hahah


[08/22/2022 5:11 PM] koutelier#0000
Actually I ditched it because it didn‚Äôt work for me . I always got wrong api . Maybe we can leave it for trading channel


[08/22/2022 5:59 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
@Sisyphuspush it happened to@me and a lot of others. It‚Äôll come back on its own just give it time. Think Twitter having some glitches

 I am using tg bot . Written in Python


[08/23/2022 11:12 AM] koutelier#0000
But we were thinking of using @curbsideprophetz bot and modify it especially for ergo discord


[08/23/2022 11:12 AM] koutelier#0000
So you will write for examples


[08/23/2022 11:12 AM] koutelier#0000
.spf wallet dis


[08/23/2022 11:12 AM] koutelier#0000
And will respond like that


[08/23/2022 11:12 AM] koutelier#0000
- #nautilus
- #ergomobile
 Etc


[08/23/2022 11:13 AM] koutelier#0000
And then for tg the same command


[08/23/2022 11:13 AM] koutelier#0000
.spf wallets tg


[08/23/2022 11:13 AM] koutelier#0000
With links for the channels


[08/23/2022 11:13 AM] koutelier#0000

Load the application
Warning The Nano X does not support side loading, therefore you must use the device emulator Speculos for loading to work. See how to install and use it. For the Nano S and Nano S Plus, you can read the following instructions.


[08/23/2022 1:25 PM] LuivatraEP#0000
Yeah, that info seems new since last I looked at it


[08/23/2022 1:27 PM] koutelier#0000

If you manage please let me know maybe doing a tutorial will help the community

They can even run Ubuntu on a usb stick for instilling ledger

Not the best way but at least there is a way for nano s plus


[08/23/2022 1:32 PM] LuivatraEP#0000

[08/23/2022 2:24 PM] koutelier#0000
Hey @koutelier, 
Here the steps I usually follow when I sideload, could you test on your end also? 

- On Linux, clone the repo https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-builder and build it with the command` sudo docker build -t ledger-app-builder:latest .
`- Clone the repo of your application 
- Compile the app with the command` sudo docker run --rm -ti -v "/dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb" -v "$(realpath .):/app" --privileged ledger-app-builder:latest
`- Execute the command` make `-> if you obtain the .elf file it means that it worked correctly
- Then execute the command` make load `-> it will sideload the application on the nano S

Forwarded from unknown: Hey Guys, as an effort to get the word out on Ergo, Andy and I discussed a community driven effort promoted by Ergo for an 'Ergo Awareness Day'. The goal would be to get many genuine tweets on this day and hopefully start a snowball effect to bring new members onto the community. We do not want to be 'shilly', so the prompt would be something like 'What are your favorite things about Ergo? or 'What brought you to Ergo?'. 

We also want to get a pool of funds for the top 10 tweets. If you guys are willing to put some into the fund please let me know. 

It will be crucial for all projects on Ergo to participate so I ask that you guys get a tweet or a couple ready for the day. 

It will happen September 15th, a few days before the estimated ETH merge. The hashtag we will use is #DiscoverErgo although i suggest to also add $ERG which is the classic one used. There will be more information coming as we need to make everyone in the community aware that it is coming! 

Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions üôÇ  @koutelier @C4lculista

[08/23/2022 5:31 PM] koutelier#0000
@glasgowm why votes on tg and discord and not on one platform?


[08/23/2022 5:40 PM] koutelier#0000
For me the cleanest way is for sigmanauts build something. Use ergo tools and experience and get money from fees . They are huge minds in sigmanauts group . We can all think and work together on something for ergo shakes. Donating and ‚Äúbegging‚Äù eventually will create conflicts . Also sigmanauts need to have the first word and not ask the whole community for every decision . Community members can join sigmanauts program after all if sigamaunts believe they worth it


[08/23/2022 5:41 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000

You use the reactions - outlined in the channel description. idk why it was here, votes usually in discord.


[08/23/2022 5:59 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
It was here because I am not sure how to do it in Discord

Can I just go up to Ledger via twitter and start the conversation? Is this how business is even conducted? And go as what?
But I really think we could fund it.
I'll make a raffle, make it last around ten days, appeal to projects building on Ergo (it would, among other things, be good advertisement for them)


[08/23/2022 6:29 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
*Any* suggestions at all are welcome. I also may not be the best person to talk with them, so if you think someone else would be better please just go ahead/tell them about this.
It will be my most ambitious raffle ever!


[08/23/2022 6:32 PM] koutelier#0000
You mean with the official ergo account ?


[08/23/2022 6:32 PM] koutelier#0000
I would go as a community member


[08/23/2022 6:35 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
No Koute, it's about talking to Ledger on behalf of Ergo about the integration. If it really is the 15k that are what's holding it back I can get confirmation that is the sum, get it (raffle), pay them and get  it done

 Someone in that thread said that's what Cardano paid

For getting it approved or for developing the app?


[08/23/2022 6:46 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
"I think $15000 for basic ledger live support for ada and native tokens. We will likely fund further development for staking.
I should also point out that non-ledger live ledger support was added without funding from catalyst. Also, here is a link with information about the catalyst proposal since it might provide ideas about a raffle for full Ergo support."

 Ledger Live support means there is an Ergo wallet integrated in the ledger live app on your pc. What we want is the Ergo app for the ledger hardware to use it with our wallets. Ledger Live integration is an additional step

Guys about the FAQ bot we will need some help .


[08/24/2022 9:48 PM] koutelier#5178
Specifically 
FAQ about:
-mining 
-nodes

I think those two areas need certain approach as ergo is POW

Please if you have the time take a look at #faq

Looks $ERG is winning poll. 

So I looked into it briefly #ergo  is a zero-compromise DeFi platform.  

With #Ergo  you can create:

‚Ä¢  highly secure Dapps  
‚Ä¢  smart contracts
‚Ä¢  utilize  their privacy tools.

This will be an interesting one..  #egro

Hello,

Part of my job at ErgoPad was to make an ErgoScript crash course presentation for the devs on the team who were not familiar with ErgoScript and related concepts. So I made this Google Slide presentation for them. I presented it to them live over Discord a few weeks ago, but I need to record a solo version as well for the ErgoPad YouTube channel. 

I would appreciate it if anyone who is technically inclined could go through it quickly and give any feedback. I am also curious to know what those of you who do not know anything about eUTXO or any of the other technical concepts think of the content and how it is presented. 

I hope it will be a useful addition to the educational material already available while serving as a complementary learning resource for developers currently in the community and hopefully to the new ones in the near future.

I have not included links to the references I used yet, but I will before recording and sharing these slides to the public. I also tried to make it somewhat entertaining.

Thanks

WARNING: 70+ slides

[09/04/2022 9:35 AM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
Could it have negative implications if true? Or is this just something that happens?


[09/04/2022 9:36 AM] koutelier#0000
running dry means they have to buy more ergs


[09/04/2022 9:37 AM] koutelier#0000
this usually happens when people buy and transfer to hot/cold wallet


[09/04/2022 9:38 AM] koutelier#0000
this is a bullish signal not negative if i understand this right

(re @glasgowm : **) 
 
 I think ~2PM UTC is most encompassing if you have people on each end of the globe, or we could host different meetings for different regions.

In this episode we talk to Gazza with Spectrum‚Ä¶ formerly known as Ergodex all about the rebrand and upcoming features on the decentralized exchange. We also speak with Dan Friedman about his new startup Zengate Global. We look at the Ergo Node v 5.0 and the costing improvements that will bring to the network. And finally Babel Fees‚Ä¶ what they‚Äôre...

@koutelier @sisyphuspush how did chats with DeCo go?


[09/06/2022 1:45 AM] sisyphuspush#0000
Went well. Will be reviewing docs for their hybrid model classes, helping with ideas for organization and such. Gonna try and attend their core meetings as much as possible to get up to speed with their vision and needs.


[09/06/2022 1:46 AM] NoahErgo#0000
Cool, i can usually never attend due to my work schedule so will be good to have another sigmanaut in there


[09/06/2022 1:46 AM] sisyphuspush#0000
Also discussed ways for students to contribute back into the program to help support it somewhat and coming up with ideas for that


[09/06/2022 1:47 AM] NoahErgo#0000

[09/06/2022 3:47 PM] cafebedouin#9837
No, I'm using git commits. I've only ever used git for backups, so doing a collaborative code thing has a completely different work flow. Also, apparently emacs was introducing a lot of weird space/tab combinations, which curbside had to fix. I probably should run the code before pushing it, but eh, I'm learning.

Git makes me feel brain-damaged. Should I fetch, pull, what's the difference? For something small like this, should I even make a branch?

[09/06/2022 3:52 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
how i remember each and my most commonly used (branches only if i'm working with lots of other people and/or major infra changes to the codebase):
`git fetch`: are there changes to the repo?
`git pull`: get me the latest 
`git add .`: prepare my changes to the repo
`git commit -m "my message here"`: self explanatory
`git push`: üéâ

Perhaps a dumb question: if I'm in telegram and get scammer message who has no messages in the chat, is the only recourse to remove them from members? Or is there some non-message ban function I'm missing? I don't try to ban people but the person posting porn and a direct scam message to me seem like good choices.

[09/11/2022 3:51 AM] Chris Ray#2713
Let's dial in our voting procedure everyone, starting with bringing people into the Sigmanaut program, I propose we use a Super Majority of 90%, I have in the past recommended a unanimous vote, however, revisiting the issue I believe that one person could hurt the program by not actively voting etc., kind of like the latest vote where you all were waiting for me after I had already voted, instead of having 1 person hold the program back with possible ideals they feel strongly about it will be better if we can approach the onboarding of Sigmanauts using a Majority vote  similar to the structure that Ergo uses to make decision's as was seen during the EIP 0027 saga, Probably a good idea to have a unanimous vote on how we vote in the future moving forward though...

[09/11/2022 10:02 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
I'm definitely in support of  making adjustments to voting, I'm not sure if 90% is the best for us in long run, but it's a good starting point IMO. The thing about the unanimous is, it's not like we require 100% of Sigmanauts to vote Yes, just  100% of those of us who actually vote on that particular measure. We could add a time limit, for instance if you wouldn't have responded to SigmaPrism vote update in 48  hrs  then your lone SigCAN vote could have been declared expired  but if you did respond and gave reason for keeping your SigmanPrism vote as SigCAN then you could have prevented the unanimous passage of the measure.


[09/11/2022 10:31 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I like 90% to start would be okay, would be okay with 80-85 as well, not too picky.

[09/12/2022 5:38 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
a week sounds reasonable and if it doesn't pass that doesn't necessarily mean it's not an area in need of adjustment, but I bet it passes unanimously w/o push back either way


[09/12/2022 5:45 AM] Chris Ray#2713
I completely agree, I just want to highlight this and develop a policy we can utilize cause the SigmaPrism vote to Sigmanaut can serve as an example of a problem we have with voting and  onboarding, and really if I am being honest if I personally had voted against someone (without changing my vote) and they were made a SIgmanaut and there is no policy to guide the process I might have felt slighted, so having something we can have as policy is good. imo.


[09/12/2022 5:50 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
You can make a thread in #üó£‚îÇvote to promote Darknight from SigCAN to Sigmanaut. Just follow previous examples and put choices at bottom like: 

:sigmanaut:  -promote to Sigmanaut
ü•ö-remain SigCAN

{Reactions}
üòé 

[09/12/2022 5:59 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
Definitely. Clearly defined policy that we adhere to is a must. Just a week or two ago when my Discord app was lagging out and I accidentally & unknowingly voted üëéon lgd thread is a recent example of what we need to avoid. Like you said, one person shouldn't be able to hold back the program and voting process. Let's see if we unanimously agree on that point though üòÇ


[09/12/2022 6:04 AM] Chris Ray#2713
ya we definitely need some checks and balances as we continue to grow, and if the EF is going to take us seriously then we need to have clearly defined policies that we all agree to abide by and we all support and contribute to.


[09/12/2022 6:09 AM] Chris Ray#2713
And we probably ought to start discussing who could be a captain of the ship, just thinking out loud here, I would like to see @NoahErgo be considered for an elevated Sigmanaut position in the future.


[09/12/2022 6:19 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
Agreed, officer role has been something I've been pondering lately, even more since your proposal to reduce voting threshold to 90%. Noah is an obvious pick IMO but so are you honestly, but picking officers should probably come after defining the officer role. Or no? I want to create a thread on this officer role and general policy. But should the thread be made on here, #sigmanauts-archive or on #üó£‚îÇvote ?


[09/12/2022 6:33 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
I missed the obvious place lol, the discussion can continue in your "let's dial in the voting procedure" thread. I added screenshots of this discussion in that thread to help keep the topic/ channel organized


[09/12/2022 6:43 AM] NoahErgo#0000
I‚Äôve always though that in time with paideia we can use that to create some solidifed frameworks for these kinds of things


[09/12/2022 6:51 AM] Chris Ray#2713
defining the Officer role is something we should all think about for sure, I am flattered you think I would fit the position, however i likely will be too busy with 5 kids for the next decade to fill the role, and that is not to mentionthe work I plan to do on Exle and Deco, lol, but for sure I will be here to be part of our growth.


[09/12/2022 6:54 AM] NoahErgo#0000

[09/12/2022 6:55 AM] NoahErgo#0000
@Haskell_plus what do you see as principle responsibilities of a sigmanaut ‚Äúofficer‚Äù


[09/12/2022 6:55 AM] Chris Ray#2713
I am looking forward to paideia too, but the organization of rules and operating procedures are not going to be produced by Paideia, those can be figured out before  it is live.


[09/12/2022 6:55 AM] NoahErgo#0000
True


[09/12/2022 7:02 AM] Chris Ray#2713
I am going to come back to this, I don't want to put my thoughts out there on what i think a Sigmanaut officer duties should be and miss something, I do not have my opinion all put together in type and i want to try to condense it.

I have no clue as I was asked to speak recently. Those awesome stickers I think Martin the ErgoDaddy put out with the QR code about PoW to the People would be great to give out at the talk. Perhaps a flyer with a QR code will be the best I can do. free merchandise to hand out but it‚Äôs short notice for me and for you all.

[09/12/2022 11:21 PM] Sigma Prism#0594
Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake

It is a bit more general in that sense but where Ergo will really shine is in what makes us unique post-merge. Which we all know a great deal of what benefits we bring as a GPU-equivalent Bitcoin and a DeFi platform to serve as an Ethereum replacement. A lot to talk about. Matt is from Nervos and is a smart, great PoW champion. I managed to get a local Cardano representative in Big Pey from just asking on Twitter.


[09/12/2022 11:22 PM] Sigma Prism#0594
We will speak also about futile censorship measures with privacy mixers and the current US administration deliberating on banning PoW. GPUs provide resiliency and decentralized access to all regardless of legislation. Another Ergo value add.


[09/12/2022 11:25 PM] Sigma Prism#0594
I will defend Cardano‚Äôs experiment with PoS to some degree as an alternative measure to onboarding investors without the need for digital commoditization and the importance of having both around for those not interested in mining. PoW is the only non-KYC and non-banking driven way to gain access to digital assets. A marvel breakthrough achieved by BTC and succeeded by Ergo. Etc etc etc. a lot of PoW and economic talk needed. Exciting discussion


[09/12/2022 11:30 PM] Sigma Prism#0594
The governance aspect of Cardano has fallen short until allegedly Voltaire gives the keys to the kingdom to the community. I take issue with stakepool operating in general. Doesn‚Äôt seem fair you should only get to mint blocks due to popularity contest or just deep pockets to pledge your own ADA to your own pool. Which leads to multipools ran by the same individuals. It‚Äôs tough to perfect. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of printing ADA out of thin air and ICOs. Only energy exertion or labor can give real value to a digital currency as it assumes the energy exerted is the justification for baseline pricing vs. fiat promise. PoS is promissory currency. Artificial block minting. But it has its use cases. PoS is much more difficult to do properly as there is no proper way to build an untethered and non-exerted new currency. It‚Äôs fun to talk about both ways.


[09/12/2022 11:36 PM] CW#8500
Messaging needs to be clear and defined that the above is personal opinion and not the views of nor speaking on behalf of the Ergo ecosystem or the EF. 

A lot of research and cross collaboration between the two ecosystems and both aim to solve different problems and from different approaches.

Language like "Cardano experiment" can land people in hot water and can be perceived as views of the ecosystem especially the way the banner is worded as being a community ambassador.

I think talking about Ethereum's switch to PoS and contrast that with ergo's PoW model- fair access distribution of Erg, miner voting controls protocol changes, subpooling on getblok.io, storage rent (similar to nervos CKB), etc etc etc. will be a better angle, especially when in conjunction with Nervos  like this. With Cardano (and Nervos ofc) being founding members of UTXO alliance, and the merge being front and center I personally would aim at Eth not Cardano. That's just my recommendation.

Sigmanauts now have acccess to the #ergonauts chat.

This was the first internal(sh) team chat. It contains early promoters of the ecosystem, people from other projects/chains, people working on erg, etc.. It's used as a Marketing chat, similar to Sigmanauts but without the entry pathways with people added at random. 

#sigmanauts-archive should still be the main place to discuss internal day-to-day stuff, but #ergonauts is handy as 'core team' is a bit more active there.

Hey @CW üôÇ

 in this video you make it seem like all changes require supermajority of miners support to occur.

Just a heads up, the 8 "everyday" changes (like storage fee factor, maximum block size, etc.) only require a simple majority of votes to pass.  

It's only the "foundational" changes that require supermajority of votes (>90%) to pass. Foundational changes increase protocol version via soft-fork.

I've updated the reddit banner with ErgoHack V details. Does anyone want to create a Discord event and maintain it as the Ergohack progresses? Not sure which would be the most useful way. Maybe an event for each stage of the event, i.e. Signup dates, Ergohack building dates and final deadline. 

For reddit, was thinking of stickying this post: https://old.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/comments/x4o4s1/ergohack_v_mining_and_minting_coming_soon_co/ unless theres a better more official post to sticky.

is Ergo doing a booth at Rare Bloom next month / anyone planning on going? I've been indecisive - pricey but also probably a lot of fun.

who all is going to CNFTCon? been debating this one as well, but it's tough schedule-wise for me. I should know this week if I can make it


[09/17/2022 8:24 AM] NoahErgo#0000
Ill be at cnftcon briefly

Guys anything you all can do to help push the ergohack forward would be appreciated. If you know any devs please dm them and ask them to join! So far applicants have been low


[09/20/2022 4:34 PM] NoahErgo#4349
I have a feeling most of our devs are now busy with other projects


[09/20/2022 4:35 PM] LuivatraEP#0000
I can confirm that is my reason, would have hoped some eth devs would be interested though


[09/20/2022 4:36 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
I'll be sure to share more often


[09/20/2022 4:36 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
@NoahErgo , was NeoCus one of the applicants?


[09/20/2022 4:40 PM] NoahErgo#4349
Not sure if she is or not


[09/20/2022 4:41 PM] NoahErgo#4349
@Luivatra yeah i would have hoped so too. Going to reach out to the sentient nft guy to see if he knows other eth devs who might be interested

this hackathon is only mining related ? @NoahErgo


[09/20/2022 4:47 PM] Bert#0000
I think that onboarding devs and projects is job #1. We need an ecosystem that can absorb the growth

[09/21/2022 3:04 PM] LuivatraEP#0000
he wrote on twitter he saw this coming a year ago but the stubborn devs didnt do anything. Told him there are no "devs" in ergo. If you want a change you gotta push for it yourself


[09/21/2022 3:04 PM] koutelier#0000
stubborn devs? for real? lol


[09/21/2022 3:05 PM] glasgowm#0000
He always takes the most hostile stance without doing any research. I only linked him the diff discussion forum post about an hour ago, wasn‚Äôt aware of anything going on


[09/21/2022 3:05 PM] LuivatraEP#0000
Also there is a constant misconception that difficulty will drop to pre merge levels after this epoch


[09/21/2022 3:05 PM] LuivatraEP#0000
its like arguing with someone that does their research on facebook


[09/21/2022 3:06 PM] koutelier#0000
just give him few ergs . he is an influencer he cares about publicity more than mining or profits from mining


[09/21/2022 3:08 PM] koutelier#0000
calling stubborn the devs of ergo is so stupid.ergo maybe is the most open source project and everything is voted before it takes place

We are punching out of our league as a chain. People might stick around more if our ecosystem were more robust. Not a judgement, as I said, we are punching out of our league. We went from barely noticed to direct competitor with eth


[09/21/2022 8:03 PM] Bert#0000
I think we need to turn every attention to developing on ergo


[09/21/2022 8:03 PM] Bert#0000
And onboarding developers

(re @Bert : *I‚Äôm going to put this out there: Much of the volatility in both hash rate and price could be minimized with a more robust ecosystem to attract and retain liquidity.*) 
 
 Seems we are on the cusp of that happening with many projects on the horizon. Im interested in seeing level of activity NightOwl, for example, brings to the ecosystem.


[09/21/2022 8:04 PM] Bert#0000
And getting the message out that we are easy to build on so that we can draw more attention


[09/21/2022 8:05 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
We all should be pushing ErgoHack registration, IMHO


[09/21/2022 8:05 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
Especially with all the mining difficulty noise


[09/21/2022 8:05 PM] Bert#0000
Yes!!!


[09/21/2022 8:06 PM] koutelier#0000
i agree. but usually devs goes where the money is . well not only devs but everyone . also i think we shill more the dev side of ergo and not the mining side


[09/21/2022 8:06 PM] Bert#0000
I didn‚Äôt know until recently that it wasn‚Äôt just for devs


[09/21/2022 8:06 PM] koutelier#0000
most of the time at least.


[09/21/2022 8:06 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
Maybe we need to show how those two sides work hand in hand on Ergo

Macro environment is trash. Not much that can be done for price. Agree chain needs more utility.

(re @Bert : *I‚Äôm going to put this out there: Much of the volatility in both hash rate and price could be minimized with a more robust ecosystem to attract and retain liquidity.*) 
 
 I think a lot can be achieved (albeit indirectly) by pushing the ergohack. In the marketing chat someone brought up the idea and we are trying for a week long community effort, starting Monday.


[09/22/2022 4:31 AM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
That's key, imo, getting really good devs in. It's not fat cow season for anyone, not even devs, the rewards could lure them in.


[09/22/2022 4:48 AM] Bert#0000
Yes, I agree. Let me hammer ergohack this weekend. Ergo just seems so damn‚Ä¶buildable.

This was the first internal(sh) team chat. It contains early promoters of the ecosystem, people from other projects/chains, people working on erg, etc.. It's used as a Marketing chat, similar to Sigmanauts but without the entry pathways with people added at random. 

#üó£‚îÇsigmanauts should still be the main place to discuss internal day-to-day stuff, but #ergonauts is handy as 'core team' is a bit more active there.*)

We have one of our first policies that has been produced by the Sigmanauts, although only 14 votes have been counted we do have a Unanimous vote to institute a 90% threshold for bringing new people into the Sigmanaut program according to the proposal I submitted 11 day's ago.
https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/921045762920570920/1018717221305974906
@JŒµnniŒµ D if we are going to seek to require a quorum of 60% for a vote to pass that will need to be in a new proposal cause I did not include it in mine, do youwant me to propose it or do you want to propose it in #üó£‚îÇvote ??


[09/23/2022 5:35 AM] Chris Ray#2713
Probably we need to institute a time frame also on voting, a 24 hour vote is probably not good, 10 days or more probably could work, but lets discuss and come up with something.

 Take your time with it, maybe some discussion beforehand would be good too, we really need time limit included with the quorum %, we need to refine our process a bit, and we probably should make the policies cover all voting not just the inclusion into the Sigmanaut program.


[09/23/2022 6:28 AM] Haskell_plus#0000
Probably be best to wrap it all into one vote so we do not have to revisit the issue.


[09/23/2022 6:33 AM] Gstoiti#0000
Imo we should also discuss anonymous voting. Probably not important atm, but I think it's better to discuss it now than when it matters.

[09/23/2022 8:13 AM] Gstoiti#0000
I would like to discuss two questions:
a) should one see which option is going to win before the vote ends?

b) anonymous voting: should one see who voted for which option (while voting or after the vote)

I think both changes can be implemented with discord bots for voting.

My opinion on a) is that one shouldn't see it and I don't think there are any important cons. Imo as it is there is a bias to vote for what the majority already voted. Changing that would lead to more honest votes and people making up their mind independently. We probably would get less consensus, so a 90% threshold might be harder to reach.

For b) I tend to anonymous voting, but there is the risk that some people intentionally block (all or important) decisions and pretend they didn't or don't participate in discussions about the topic. I don't think this risk is big.

 Have you looked into Ergo Nation? I think that would be a great project to bring more attention to.

Anonymous voting sounds like a great idea. Ideally, in the future when DAO tooling is available, we would be voting with an address anyways which could allow for easy anonymous voting. I guess it would depend on what we're voting on though, as a lot of voting does require discussion which ultimately reveals how people are voting anyways.

For duration to vote that's interesting to think about as well. For things like inclusion into the Sigmanaut program I think somewhere in that range of 10-15 days works. For future voting when we turn into a DAO and potentially have access to a treasury etc we'll have to think about the various proposals we'd be voting on. 

This is where I think we could continue to open up another can of ergworms and start discussing a formation of a DAO and how we would like to proceed in that direction.

so for your questions a) and b) - the answer is really nuanced haha. depends on what we're voting for. but I think a) and b) should definitely be options that the proposer could choose to implement


[09/23/2022 9:19 AM] crandano#0000
When you start to imagine the possible list of proposals we'll be voting on in the future this topic can go pretty deep - which is great and why i'm in this space. This is one of the topics that interests me the most and it's going to be interesting to see all of these various ecosystems and projects start to implement governance and their ambassador programs etc. 

You really need to have people that give a shit and I think Ergo benefits greatly from having passionate people that really want to deep think on what the best route is for these future systems.

I'm headed to bed now but just wanted to throw some words out! I'll be following and contributing to the conversation

[09/23/2022 9:28 AM] crandano#0000
people interested in structuring a Sigmanauts DAO could start thinking about and hashing out the program. in Project Swarm and SingularityNET there are various workgroups like what we're already doing with marketing, branding, moderators. One of them is for structuring the program - it's not a topic that interests everyone + everyone gets a final vote in the structure anyways so overall there's no missing out on how the structure is ultimately formed by not participating in the structure workgroup

The regulatory push will only get harder. At least in US, EU and other aligned countries.

Any work around truly decentralized systems will be under pressure.

The means will be by identifying pockets of centralized control. Same tool works for building truly decentralized system and regulator/ law enforcement.

So, all I can suggest to aspiring DAOs out there is to have a strategy. Either be ready to comply, and be proactive about it. Or build anon, resilient from the start.

Holy fuck.

It is.

The CFTC has gone after them saying the protocol itself was a futures violation and that the DAO governance didn't matter, it was still an unincorporated entity.

This is BAD.

 Yep, for example, a marketplace was mentioned before where we could sell merch to build a treasury. This is a great idea, but when there's a few of us in the US - as an example - this becomes complicated when the conversation comes up on how to handle it. 

Depending where you live and perhaps based on how anonymous you've been in the space the question of, "Can I participate in this?" is going to increasingly come up on a person's radar if it isn't already

 Yes, I am in some of the working groups for ErgoNation and I think it can play an important part in decision making in addition to a Sigmanauts DAO. 

Just want to add that voting via address doesn't make it automatically anonymous.

(re @crandano : *people interested in structuring a Sigmanauts DAO could start thinking about and hashing out the program. in Project Swarm and SingularityNET there are various workgroups like what we're already doing with marketing, branding, moderators. One of them is for structuring the program - it's not a topic that interests everyone + everyone gets a final vote in the structure anyways so overall there's no missing out on how the structure is ultimately formed by not participating in the structure workgro...*) 
 
 I think that's a great idea and I would be happy to contribute.

I was thinking about creating a group discussing DAO guidelines and problems independent from ErgoNation and the Sigmanaut's DAO.

DAOs which manage funds have to deal with budgeting (especially investment DAOs like Walrus DAO). Although many people seem to have an aversion against TradFi, budgeting and investment decision making, it is the same whether it is done by a group of randos or a group of divisional managers. It's all about incentive conflicts and information uncertainty.

Actually, if budgeting mechanism are designed the right way and incentives are aligned (as a consequence of the budgeting mechanism and rewards), then there is no difference between a centralized decision (board decides how to invest after receiving reports from division managers) or a decentralized decision (each division manager decides), because everyone decides in the same way and agrees. 

Imo there is a lot of managerial accounting literature on agency conflicts and budgeting, investment DAOs could learn from, since investment DAOs are probably the closest real life setting to game theory one can find. And I feel that's important, because there is no regulation (e.g. about disclosure of holdings), which protects naive users.

As you probably notice, I am more of a theory/math guy, but I think in a group we could develop some basic gui <clipped message>

 Full support for this. Lack of regulation does not make it ethically right to carry out insider trading and such.

Here too, Ergo can show innovation in setting standards for DAO structures that align with the fair spirit in the manifesto.


[09/23/2022 1:25 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
Note, I refer to a culture of projects using good standards, and users demanding them. Not some centralized regulation.

 I definitely want to join and know a few others that are likeminded and would like to contribute. 

On the Sigmanauts structure workgroup side of things, I‚Äôll see what everyone is thinking around the conversations above and we can go from there. 

I think it‚Äôs easy for some people to say who cares, this is crypto. I care. Some don‚Äôt. They‚Äôre tough conversations to have and I‚Äôm interested in everyone‚Äôs input.


[09/23/2022 10:07 PM] Bert#0000
I like the idea of a sigmanauts Dao. If we are going to be leaders, we need to lead, and this is a good step.


[09/24/2022 3:56 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I also agree that a formal dao creates a bit of authenticity and authority (?) Behind any actions the group pursues


[09/24/2022 3:57 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I haven't been able to be active here, but I'm lurking and would like to be included ü§ô


[09/24/2022 11:28 PM] Bert#0000
I like the concept. I would like some more clarification as to the purpose this  Dao?  As I understands DAO‚Äôs, they are able to be decentralized and autonomous because their purpose and functions are clearly defined.


[09/24/2022 11:40 PM] crandano#0000
(re @Bert : *I like the concept. I would like some more clarification as to the purpose this  Dao?  As I understands DAO‚Äôs, they are able to be decentralized and autonomous because their purpose and functions are clearly defined.*) 
 
 There has been talk about having a treasury that the Sigmanauts control (as well as find ways to fund). To do so we need to begin conversations on the structure of the program. I mention a DAO but there could be other ways to go about it.

There's also conversation on setting procedures for voting etc which becomes a deeper conversation if we begin to think about the potential of having control over a treasury in the future

(re @Bert : *I like the concept. I would like some more clarification as to the purpose this  Dao?  As I understands DAO‚Äôs, they are able to be decentralized and autonomous because their purpose and functions are clearly defined.*) 
 
 I agree and think that's a discussion we should focus in hand with overall structure. I believe our "purpose" should be as general as possible (facilitate community & ecosystem growth for example) while having defined working groups focus on specific things will allow for more organic, well-informed actions. These groups could allow for more participation from those outside of the program while providing a pipeline for new sigmanauts.


[09/24/2022 11:46 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
Groups could be guided by Sigmanauts aligned with that group while coordinating with all sigmanauts when needed for larger campaigns


[09/24/2022 11:51 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
This would also provide for a more streamlined voting process for proposals that are relevant to that groups actions, possibly, as those people would be the ones more likely involved with discussions leading up to it.


[09/24/2022 11:52 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
While leaving macro proposals for the larger group


[09/25/2022 12:51 AM] Bert#0000
This has a lot of potential. I like what Cardano has done with Catalyst, but don‚Äôt have to limit ourselves to development. That being said, I really like the idea of creating a structure that helps pipeline development and encouraging innovative ideas. Sigmanauts could sort thru ideas and proposals, serving as coaches, and present them to the wider community.


[09/25/2022 12:52 AM] Bert#0000
Just don‚Äôt want to see the sigmanauts become ‚Äúcentral planning‚Äù.


[09/25/2022 4:57 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Personally, I dont know how much we should be involved with development as a group outside of open-source tooling and helping new Devs navigate to libraries, educational resources, etc. I see our role as more of a resource for the community, helping to give platforms, structure, and access to grass-roots community efforts. I think we could focus more on promoting the pipelines that are already there, such as Deco, EgoPad, etc.  From my understanding, the intentions are for the Foundation to eventually dissolve at some point. I would like to see the Sigmanaut Program take this opportunity to not only to find structure for us, but think about preparing these platforms and avenues for larger community engagement and how that impacts the way we structure ourselves.


[09/25/2022 5:02 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
On a side note, does the Program have a dedicated wallet? I have been working on a commissioned series that Im using for an NFT airdrop to the NFT community this fall. Getting it verified on SH soon to allow for trading and such. All proceeds were originally planned to go to Development Fund, but I would would be happy to direct proceeds from royalties or any other 1/1's that get sold to the Sigmanaut Program.


[09/25/2022 5:04 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Though I would like for us to have a defined mission statement or such so it could be used to promote the program and maybe bring more eyeballs and involvement.


[09/25/2022 5:05 PM] Bert#0000
I agree. We need a mission statement


[09/25/2022 5:05 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
One last thing. I would like to secure a Domain for the group. Sigmanauts.io, .com.  .net, etc all seem to be available. Anyone have thoughts on which one we should secure?


[09/25/2022 5:08 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
I can provide the funds to secure it if anyone thats more comfortable with web design/management wants to "control" it.


[09/25/2022 5:08 PM] Bert#0000
Main thing for me is to have a defined purpose. We need to be more than a club for the cool kids. We need to be the vanguard, both in thought and action


[09/25/2022 5:09 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
I mean, we are a club of cool kids, but I get what you're saying


[09/25/2022 5:11 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
That's why I stress also focusing on raising awareness and creating easy onramps for involvement as we also work on structure


[09/25/2022 5:17 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
I think with the proper foundation, our approach can go from a place where we are identifying individuals who are putting in a lot of work for the ecosystem and considering "promotion", to a place where we are an incubator for enagement and inclusion much earlier in the process. Ideally, the Sigmanaut program should get to a point where its as inclusive as possible, or made obsolete by the tools and community it helped build.


[09/25/2022 5:52 PM] NoahErgo#4349
Hi guys sorry for not being so active here my attention has been fixed on making ergohack great


[09/25/2022 5:54 PM] NoahErgo#4349
Not sure if a wallet currently exists, i think intention is to eventually have a multisig setup probably using paideia to fund initiatives in sigmanauts


[09/25/2022 5:54 PM] NoahErgo#4349
Also not sure what goal is for webpage or if that is necessary @Sisyphuspush what would utility of the website be you think?


[09/25/2022 5:57 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Initial thought would be to help bring awareness to the program and have somewhere we can post information, updates, etc. for public. If we anticipate program growing and being a tool for more community involvement, it could benefit have a central place for such info thats not on a specific social.


[09/25/2022 5:58 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Also, if we do have a DAO, transparency will be key


[09/25/2022 6:04 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
I would also imagine it could be used as a platform for the DAO to vote by connecting wallet and such...just throwing ideas out there


[09/25/2022 6:05 PM] NoahErgo#4349
Ideas are good üôÇ i dont know much about web hosting but I think it would be good to have the structure more public so people can see what we are doing


[09/25/2022 6:05 PM] NoahErgo#4349
Not necessarily the chats but the structure of the org


[09/25/2022 6:06 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Can also post bounties and such there


[09/25/2022 6:07 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Here's the question, I suppose....


[09/25/2022 6:09 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
As is, when people want to get more involved, they could receive a multitude of answers, some of which may not apply to their passion or skillset.


[09/25/2022 6:10 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
I think we rely on people not only having the passion and skills, but the time and energy to figure out how they can help the best.


[09/25/2022 6:14 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Having an area for people to be directed to, that isn't a socal platform, will make for a more user friendly experience when wanting to contribute


[09/25/2022 6:17 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
My last point would be one of perception. A DAO is an organization and should be represented in a somewhat professional and transparent manner. In that regard, a website would seem like a good investment.


[09/25/2022 6:25 PM] NoahErgo#4349
Yeah makes sense to me


[09/25/2022 6:25 PM] NoahErgo#4349
For a lot of the dao fund management stuff unfortunately i think have to wait for either paideia or ergo team otherwise we are just voting with discord


[09/25/2022 6:33 PM] Gstoiti#0000
I would like to discuss two questions:
a) should one see which option is going to win before the vote ends?

b) anonymous voting: should one see who voted for which option (while voting or after the vote)

I think both changes can be implemented with discord bots for voting.

My opinion on a) is that one shouldn't see it and I don't think there are any important cons. Imo as it is there is a bias to vote for what the majority already voted. Changing that would lead to more honest votes and people making up their mind independently. We probably would get less consensus, so a 90% threshold might be harder to reach.

For b) I tend to anonymous voting, but there is the risk that some people intentionally block (all or important) decisions and pretend they didn't or don't participate in discussions about the topic. I don't think this risk is big.


[09/25/2022 6:38 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
Hello everybody, I don't know why but I struggle to access the channel on discord.
I brought up voting proposals on there I would like your input on.
As I said there, I also think we should consider making the Sigmanaut role something dependent on commitment.
We are many and will be more, but I don't see this reflected in actual actions.
Maybe it's too strict? Anyway, at this point it's just an idea.


[09/25/2022 6:38 PM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
See you in a week I guess, have we settled on a time?


[09/25/2022 7:21 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Should we build a working group to discuss a mission statement, goals, Sigmanaut activities and minimum requirements (activity, voting, behaviour,...)? Or a discord thread? Or use this group here?

I would use https://ergonaut.space/en/Ergo/Contributing/Sigmanauts
as a starting point.

Is that the optimism logo üëÄ are they joining the hack?!?! Or is it a mistake and should instead be the alephium logo ü§î

It will pass for sure, reward reduction passed and was way more controversial.

Good. Shows that both the foundation and the community are reactive when issues present.

Right now I think it's important to spread the word about WHY we are having such slow block times, HOW EIP-37 means to resolve that issue, and remind people of all the other positive things that are taking place


[09/29/2022 5:55 PM] Marty#4039
it's very depressing to see price less than half what it was two weeks ago, so people need positive reinforcement


[09/29/2022 5:55 PM] Marty#4039
and to be assured that things will improve


[09/29/2022 5:55 PM] Marty#4039
it's also good to educate why nothing seems to be working. How proxy contracts work (spectrum, ergopad, etc), so that people know their funds are safe and it may take 2 or more hours to receive assets when they initiate these transactions

Yep that‚Äôs correct, only published the first two

[10/03/2022 9:09 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Here is a summary of some of the Sigmanaut convo I have picked up on. I think these have been the 6 main topics that we have discussed, and the order which makes most sense to address them. Should we all discuss these 1 by 1 until agreed upon, or organize the working group to fill it out more for the larger group to then review/amend/vote on?


[10/03/2022 9:09 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Primary Objectives

Create Mission Statement/Social Contract
Organizing Activities/Tasks/Groups around mission statement
Creating Expectations for Sigmanauts & SigCans
Proposal procedures
Voting Procedures
Funding

Create Mission Statement/Social Contract - Should the mission Sigmanuats be broad (i.e. Support grassroots development, marketing, and community building effort) or specific to identified needs?

Organizing Activities/Tasks/Groups around mission statement -  This may be dictated by the Mission Statement somewhat. Should we continue organizing efforts as we have? Should we have working groups for specific needs of the ecosystem, while larger group missions are more macro & organizational?

Creating Expectations for Sigmanauts & SigCans - Again, this is likely to be dictated by the previous two objectives. Should SigCans have clearly defined expectations for promotion or supported in their existing efforts? What do we expect of Sigmanauts? Do they need to participate in a certain number of votes and meetings? What about Sigmanauts actively building projects with less time to participate but want to stay in the loop? What are qualifications for demotion?

Proposal procedures - Who can make a proposal (Sigcans?)? Should we limit proposals to a certain time of month? Timeframe to discuss and debate proposals?

Voting Procedures - Is it the same for SigCan votes as it is for proposals? Threshold for Quorum & Passing? Timeframe to vote? Should we have an abstain option? When will votes be held? Nominating for SigCans and Sigmanaut promotion procedures?

Funding - Explore various avenues for funding (Raffles, NFT sales, Donations, Foundation Grant, store, etc.)


[10/03/2022 10:58 PM] Bert#0000
We also discussed a dao before you got there


[10/03/2022 11:25 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
I remember the DAO conversation, but figured since we are waiting on infrastructure for it we could tackle some of these other things in the meantime. Would it be possible to make a side discussion for each of these topics (if we agree that these are the priorities) similar to the Voting Procedure Discussion so we can have a dedicated space to consolidate ideas?


[10/04/2022 1:30 AM] NoahErgo#0000
I think like CW mentioned, we are just waiting on the notion board to get those working groups in place and that will be the perfect place to have those discussions

To edit
Once logged in click the 3 dot menu on top right
Click edit
Another "Edit" button will appear on top right, click that.
Navigate back to the link above

Notion
Dashboard will display all the tiles from the different workstreams to provide an overall view

Each pipeline will be refined to suit Sigmanauts categories
To create a tile, navigate to relevant pipeline, e.g graphics, and hover over a column. A "+ New" link will appear. Click and fill out the details and click enter. To expand, click the tile and a number of properties will appear. fill out as desired. 

You can attach links, files, images, set due date, assign task, etc

Its important to define the "Work Stream" as the notion boards are filtered by this. i.e Graphic work streak is displayed in Graphic board. Tiles can also have multiple work streams to be displayed in different pipelines.

I can reach out to a few artists and see if they would be interested in doing a carving and minting image to offer up as well.

You can tag posts here (and filter by tags). Let me know if this works for people but felt things were getting messy & lost in #üó£‚îÇvote

@TypoDaPsycho from Zawy: "I saw your difficulty chart and it looks like the new method was implemented 4 days ago and it looks a lot better. It's possibly very close to being like ASERT, WTEMA, and LWMA, except for the epochs causing a 128 block delay. I believe you could it change difficulty every block and average block time would still be accurate. The reason to do the change is that delaying adjustment is what usually ends up in oscillations. Since it appears you didn't have catastrophic oscillations with the older method of 1024 blocks per change (as I would have expected even before the merge), I think you'll be OK with the current method. But if oscillations return, adjusting every block is the fix."

Why the hell does Ergo not have some sort of on chain voting like Cardano does with @voteaire ?
What a game changing idea.
An on chain voting/governance mechanism that could go towards a marketing treasury for Ergo.
Each vote could be a small tx fee of 0.5 ERG for example.

Its a Decentralized ID verification NFT project where users are anonymous and verification is somewhat merit based, if I understand that correctly


[10/08/2022 4:39 AM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
Yeah, IDs and gov that maximizes decentralization. Enables 1 person 1 vote, as opposed to token plutocracy.

Anonymity is required for proper decentralization. That does not mix well with Sigmanaut program, because as some kind of ambassadors, sigmanauts are public facing.

It has been quiet in EN lately, but the framework is designed and tested:

 In this case i think it was not about the sigmanauts in specific. Afaik it was about a discussion to community vote what to do with the ETC account. 
Wouldn‚Äôt it be THE perfect tool for that if a vote took place?

 Not enough ID holders to claim representation of the whole Ergo community though.

With widespread IDs, and attached reputations, it would be a great use case right now.

The reputations kinda have to be in place before an important vote is announced.

Interestingly, even though it is small, that set of 20 ID holders is currently the best on-chain representation of Ergo community for ecosystem governance.

That's very generous of you, Foe. Thus far we have the 50k $AHT, 3 artist pumpkin carving NFTs, and I will get a Mummy to donate. However many you would like to make would be appreciated. The main goal is to get as many people to use the minting and auction function as possible. We were planning on splitting the $AHT among all who participate and the NFTs would go to the most creative ones.

(re @sisyphuspush : *I'm also open to using Sisyphus Collection wallet...was going to be used for fundraising efforts anyway*) 
 
 just forward me a screenshot or all donation ones for graphics


[10/10/2022 10:02 PM] Bert#0000
I think we need a separate wallet for promotions. Good idea.


[10/10/2022 10:04 PM] Darkkknight111#0000
we all can find for funds and contribute to the fund, but i would like a @AngieHar or any foundation have control of it


[10/10/2022 10:10 PM] Darkkknight111#0000
but for this contest , we can do @sisyphuspush :)


[10/10/2022 10:15 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
Sure, you can send them here...Anything that doesnt get used for this promotion can be sent to whatever wallet gets set up for future promotions.

Couple more unrelated things...1) Didn't get the chance to go through the SigCan list this weekend. I will try again this week to make some time for it. 2) Made a Mission statement draft in https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/1027626860605087784 if other Sigmanauts could give it a looksee and offer any input or changes. Would really love to see us be able to finalize this and start working on the organization side of things.


[10/11/2022 6:51 AM] Bert#0000
Can we get a copy of the mission statement on here?  Discord and I have a hate hate relationship.


[10/11/2022 6:53 AM] Sisyphuspush#7967
This is the rough draft I posted:


[10/11/2022 6:53 AM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Insipired by the Ergo Manifesto, Sigmanuats carrying forward its mission of building "society through horizontal cooperation through production under the division of labor, trade and exchange, and solidarity and mutual aid."
We work to ensure Ergo remains an ecosyetem for regular people by building and supporting avenues for education, engagement, and participation. We aim to not only spread awareness of the ecosystem, but to ensure its stewardship remains with the people. As Sigmanuats, we hold ourselves and eachother to the highest standard as ambassadors of not only
the Sigmanuat Program, but of Ergo as a whole.


[10/11/2022 6:54 AM] Bert#0000
Nice. Let me know if you want to cooperate on this.


[10/11/2022 6:55 AM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Of course! Would like as much input from everybody as possible. This was drafted based on things that were mentioned previously by others.


[10/11/2022 6:55 AM] Sisyphuspush#7967
May have missed some things or not made others as clear as they could be...


[10/11/2022 6:56 AM] Bert#0000
Let me see if I can break that into some bullet point segments and see what is there.


[10/11/2022 7:02 AM] Bert#0000
Wow, it‚Äôs actually really good. I made two additions, both small, but I think important.


[10/11/2022 7:03 AM] Bert#0000
Insipired by the Ergo Manifesto, Sigmanuats carrying forward its mission of building "society through horizontal cooperation through production under the division of labor, trade and exchange, and solidarity and mutual aid."

And holding to the principles of decentralization and transparency.

 Agree with both additions


[10/11/2022 7:20 AM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
Typo Sigmanuats at start


[10/11/2022 7:35 AM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
Sigmanauts are now starting to organize things, and be public facing ambassadors. 

Unfortunately, I am in a position where I can't associate with it using these tg and discord handles.

So, I thank you all for good times here. I will stick around for discussions in other chats. Maybe I will even rejoin with another pseudonym in the future, when I find the time to do a proper privacy setup.

[10/11/2022 9:51 PM] Bert#0000
Yes, if we are going to promo late October is the perfect time. Won‚Äôt do this regularly.


[10/11/2022 9:58 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
I also think that depending on final prize pool and participation, we could have remaining NFTs for future promotions to work with

[10/11/2022 10:00 PM] crandano#0000
Catching up on Discord and here. Solid mission statement üëç

What‚Äôs the best way for interested devs to get into the ecosystem? My take is have them get into the dev channel on Discord and make an introduction, point them towards the DeCo videos and lgd‚Äôs doc/lessons, GitHub, and forum - anything else I‚Äôm missing? 

Do you think a form similar to Sigmanauts would help specifically for devs just to list their skills and it auto posts to something like the dev channel?  Or a small section on the Sigmanauts form giving info on how to get into the dev ecosystem on Ergo? Only mentioning because we occasionally see applicants with dev experience


[10/11/2022 10:09 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Yeah I think having potential ergo devs talk to other ergo devs would be fantastic. That way they can hear from those already building on Ergo on why its beneficial to be a dev here


[10/11/2022 10:12 PM] crandano#0000
(re  : *<T U L O (ErgoMinnow)> Yeah I think having potential ergo devs talk to other ergo devs would be fantastic. That way they can hear from those already building on Ergo on why its beneficial to be a dev here*) 
 
 Yeah, seems like people typically make an intro post in the dev channel and list their skills and look for things to help with.

I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs anything else I‚Äôm missing when letting interested devs know about the ecosystem

i would like to take this as a learning moment , not trying to disrespect @Sisyphuspush becuase i know he is learning but would like to share some key tricks when creating an flyer or event poster 
things to focus
Title,sub title (catchy 1-2 liner to grab the attention)
Description (normally 3-4 lines,depends on the event and size you are working on)
Guide (be specific , highlight things which are most important part)
sharing two examples with you guys , one is done by @Sisyphuspush and other is done by me , some content but made more attractive
@Sisyphuspush thanks you for everthing ‚ù§Ô∏è i just want others to learn also and had to take this as example haha

 Well all I bring is that I know everybody and connect them, make them feel at home, answer the questions I can and tell them who can answer the questions I can't, shill every last thing on ergo 24/7

Forwarded from Gstoiti: The organizers of the German Cardano Summit event in Wiesbaden are looking for (online) speakers about Ergo and Ergo projects in German or English. Afaik there will be (up to) 200 people.

They just asked in the German telegram group and NightOwl discord. So if any project wants to reach a German Cardano audience, that might be an opportunity.

 Try adapting  it with the figma layout and if you need me,let me know


[10/23/2022 11:47 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Added the NFT images to figma layout. There are 3 blank ones remaining. I believe @Foeniculum mentioned making a few gnomekins. If so, then we are set when those are completed. There will also be the artist carving NFTs.

When you hover over the votes, it'll say Glasgow, TypoDaPsycho + X number more. If you click X number it pops up everyone who's voted. If you're not paying attention you can delete them like a jack off. IDK if it requires being creator of thread or not, probably since I have permissions and forget I do

The idea with the Sigmanaut Champion is it'll be one the first deposits in the Sigmanaut Treasury. Or can be held in a multisig address, I just can't be the only owner if it's to be genuine & meaningful IMO. 

 We can choose the name, traits (weapons, armor, background) and put promotional text in the description. 

Then we can promote it on Twitter, benefiting both the group & Ergo Champions.

After browsing around the Sigmanauts chat today I have decided to donate 1000 $ERG to the program to help bootstrap a treasury, it is funds from Exle for my contributions so it really has come from Ergo, and I just using it for good - I just really want to get people thinking about what it means to have a vote that matters, and with funds involved I would like to see people to start thinking about  where the funds are from and what they are going towards, Ergo Champions inspired my move - I love the ambition there - just can't maintain a focus on NFT things right now.
Now, where do I send the funds?

[10/30/2022 1:55 AM] drehaf#0090
wow @Chris Ray ! amazing. thank you!

I see a couple of options here:
1. We ask up a level for help in organizing a treasury and once a little more organization occurs have it be handed back.  
2. We do it ourselves with the people who want to do it with full transparency and continue on with the spark of interest and motivation from today. 

So far I think we are on a good path. We have a voting proposal in the works and are working on a method to increase voter turnout as well.  

But perhaps #1 is the best option for a hot minute unless Chris wants to hold on to it until we get a little further down the line?

what are some of your thoughts on this?


[10/30/2022 1:56 AM] Bert#0000
Blown away! Thank you so much!


[10/30/2022 3:00 AM] Chris Ray#2713
It has been awhile since I suggested a treasury for the Sigmanauts to utilize for incentives to expand our efforts impact, back then I asked those involved who was willing to take on responsibility of holding the keys and there was others willing to take on the responsibility, without using a multisig protocol it comes down to trust, I can hold the ERG and distribute it according to our organization wishes and we can take some time to figure out how to operate a treasury with this seed fund and hopefully it grows, @Armeanio a while back had mentioned seeking EF funding for the program - I think the program should have operating rules with checks and balances before the EF makes a contribution to a ambassador program and the rules should come from the work we put in to govern ourselves, we can do this, the discussion lately has been moving in a good direction and we just need to dial things in so that we have a solid understanding of how we will be operating together - now lets get serious.


[10/30/2022 3:06 AM] drehaf#0090
agreed, let's do this...firing up the terminal right now actually!


[10/30/2022 3:07 AM] Chris Ray#2713
Lets define some of our first milestones we need to establish to be successful.
  
I believe we need to cache our operating procedure - voting etc. in 1 place that is simple to navigate to so all Sigmanauts can easily look up our operating procedures and the rules a Sigmanaut should abide by,and we need to get our mission statement finished and passed by a vote.

Verified blue checks are going to be $20/month on Twitter. We might raffle an nft or something to fund this for a while

(re @TIMRŒ£G7 : *Verified blue checks are going to be $20/month on Twitter. We might raffle an nft or something to fund this for a while*) 
 
 interesting, probably heading into a future where you can create posts where only verified accounts can reply.


[10/31/2022 3:41 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Yep, I think you're right. You've got to kill the bots somehow, but I bet there will still be spam for $20/mo

 Nice man. @Sigmanaut would be perfect in my opinion. What does everyone think? 

agenda-wise for the meeting Sunday, I'd like to tack on a bit of discussion around creating a work group based around governance for those interested 

There's also a poll for whether this group should meet in Telegram or Discord (guess we could bridge it, eh?) as well as a nice discussion that took place here:

heyo @glasgowm for Discord and Telegram, I know we use Wick and Telegram Bridge. On the Telegram side what are we using for spam protection? I guess overall - when you have a moment - could you give some tips on Discord<>Telegram along with the steps you (or anyone else here) takes to prevent spam and make it a pleasant experience?

I feel like we do a really solid job on Telegram and moderation and there's some projects that need help haha

anyone have any insights? it's interesting to me

also @dadreboi thanks for making the meeting notes, I'll tack on some notes soon

OrgRobot on TG restricts users when they join, stops spam in it's tracks. Unfortunately it doesn't work on groups 10k+ atm due to a bug so Shieldy does it's best in the main platform chat.

Question is, what would the Sigmanauts like the handle to be on this account? If there is any interest I will donate my "@Sigmanaut" handle but totally up to you all*) 
 
 In response to this

(re @crandano : *Nice man. @Sigmanaut would be perfect in my opinion. What does everyone think? 

agenda-wise for the meeting Sunday, I'd like to tack on a bit of discussion around creating a work group based around governance for those interested 

There's also a poll for whether this group should meet in Telegram or Discord (guess we could bridge it, eh?) as well as a nice discussion that took place here:

 I say let CW keep his handle. I like Sigmanauts (plural) & it looks like its available

Sigmanaut comes across as a single person rather than a group, IMHO


[11/04/2022 6:20 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
Got Sigmanauts handle in case its what we decide on.

[11/04/2022 6:29 PM] NoahErgo#0000
To me cardano whale seems like an individual person who community rallied around. Feels wrong to try to imitate that with a group owned account. Just my 2 cents. Also the ‚Äúergo whale‚Äù account on twitter annoys me lol


[11/04/2022 6:29 PM] drehaf#0090
my 2 cents....
CW was kind enough to offer i think we should take it...CW has a strong enough presence with his name alone and will be fine swapping.


[11/04/2022 6:30 PM] drehaf#0090
everyone knows CW üòâ


[11/04/2022 6:30 PM] drehaf#0090
and love him dearly i might add


[11/04/2022 6:30 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
This account would come with all of the followers already


[11/04/2022 6:30 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
Correct?


[11/04/2022 6:31 PM] drehaf#0090
he's offering over the handle not the account i think...


[11/04/2022 6:32 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
The account will be the old Ergo one, if I followed along correctly


[11/04/2022 6:32 PM] drehaf#0090
what did they give back to eth


[11/04/2022 6:32 PM] drehaf#0090
the handle right?


[11/04/2022 6:32 PM] drehaf#0090
not the account


[11/04/2022 6:32 PM] NoahErgo#0000
New account with no followers


[11/04/2022 6:33 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
So it would have the followers....think CW is offering handle to go with it


[11/04/2022 6:33 PM] drehaf#0090
yeah....new account and sig handle...CW keeps followers


[11/04/2022 6:33 PM] drehaf#0090
to be clear?


[11/04/2022 6:33 PM] NoahErgo#0000
No


[11/04/2022 6:33 PM] drehaf#0090
spell it out plz üòâ


[11/04/2022 6:33 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Literally just giving us the password and ownership of the account


[11/04/2022 6:34 PM] NoahErgo#0000
then sigmanauts have control


[11/04/2022 6:34 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
Old ergo account (with followers) to Sigmanauts....CW offered his Sigmanaut handle to go with it for us


[11/04/2022 6:34 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
I secured Sigmanauts handle as well, if we want to use


[11/04/2022 6:34 PM] drehaf#0090

im gonna put this in meeting notes so it's clear


[11/04/2022 6:35 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
Agreed


[11/04/2022 6:36 PM] drehaf#0090
and CW will continue to use the old account in this case? it won't go to waste?

(re  : *<qx()> and CW will continue to use the old account in this case? it won't go to waste?*) 
 
 I think he mentioned old handle will be used to link to various Ergo stuff

And CW account will remain same

[11/04/2022 7:32 PM] CW#0000
Hey guys seems a little confusion so will provide some clarification. 

The EF will provide access to the account (65k followers) via tweet deck, it's an admin panel of sorts for the Sigmanauts

Just need to decide on a handle to represent the account, plural sounds good and also decide who will have access.


[11/04/2022 7:33 PM] drehaf#0090

[11/04/2022 11:14 PM] drehaf#0090
cool there are like 10 liners to get chat member count...nice.

could build a separate bot to:
Watch every chat and feed everything into a DB from every channel and spit out:
- word clouds
- character counts per message per time period.
- messages per time period
- unique member messages per day....

and so on and so on....

ok lemme finish the vote app first...dammit.


[11/04/2022 11:16 PM] drehaf#0090
we could start off just watching the bridge in discord which would get both tele and discord and be easily identifiable.


[11/04/2022 11:16 PM] drehaf#0090
and then expand from there


[11/04/2022 11:21 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
Wonder if it‚Äôs easier to get all chat logs. There will be quite a bit of data cleaning involved. But a simple word cloud like you mentioned or n-grams would probably suffice for v1


[11/04/2022 11:25 PM] drehaf#0090
i can clean on input

Just posted the proposal for the temporary SigCan voting rules. Once the new working group has a better proposal, we could just replace it.

Please vote and comment

So it looks like I should segment sigcan voting rules from normal vote rules on this app. I should also separate if the user is a sig or an ergonaut. Then two groups can use it and only get notified if they should be included in the vote. No prob. Got a lot of work done last night. Successfully pushed DMs to tele, discord, Twitter to notify people on vote creation. Today I‚Äôll work on the backend scripts that notify mid way during vote, and at the end of the vote as well as the final result posted in a channel here (I‚Äôll try to use a web-hook for that). Once I‚Äôm done with this draft I‚Äôll dump code to git and will give a live demo at the sigcan zoom tomorrow.

@glasgowm is it possible to promote Kill_it_with_Coffee to SigCan? They have 10 votes in favor and vote has been up 28 days. Not sure of the current process for promotion.

I'm going to whitelist all sigs in the sig permission group (including a few core members not in the sig list). Will post all the usernames here. When they go to the voting site they will need to create an account WITH that username as it is written. I think that's the easiest way for me to whitelist at this point.


[11/07/2022 2:21 PM] glasgowm#9381
I think that's fine for SIGCAN, Sigmanauts should be able to add people to the SIGCAN role too so give it a shot and lmk any issues

ok, forcing myself to tidy up the vote app asap and we can test it out. 
Opinions needed:

Right now the system only pushes notifications based on the literal VOTE record. Notifications success to users are not stored simply because I don't think it's necessary. That means if a new user joins a few minutes after the vote is created and then the initial notification vote already went out, they won't get another notification until the day count = 1/2 way done notification. All this leads to my question...
Do we want to allow vote makers to hit the "notify people again button" as was discussed? Thinking more about it I'd rather just let the system give the initial, middle, last, and closed notifications...any more and it's over kill spamming for people with happy fingers...

lemme know if you agree and it'll save me some lines of code. 

@Sigmanauts

 I‚Äôd go with what you‚Äôre currently thinking is best (first, middle, last). 

Have you thought about possibilities with anonymous voting? This seems like something a project like Ergo Nation could utilize (as well as Sigmanauts on certain votes)

Will conversation be able to take place in the app? Sorry I missed the demo the other day when I was late to the meeting. If so, what about possibilities of anonymous conversation? Just curious


[11/07/2022 11:57 PM] dadreboi#0000
- i can make anon vote button...the only thing is the system would still know that you voted anon just not what you voted, so in cases of 100% votes and only a few anon, you could prob figure it out. But I imagine that would be rare no?

- hmm...yes, i can prob build a simple convo tool into each vote page...lemme think about that


[11/07/2022 11:59 PM] dadreboi#0000
The initial and close vote will be pushed to a vote Channel. So we could just use discord threads with that too.

 Agree with the 1st, middle, last approach. Thinking ahead..Could there be additional notifications beyond those reminders? For things like when a quorum is reached?


[11/08/2022 12:14 AM] drehaf#0090
yes, can add that logic any time


[11/08/2022 12:14 AM] sisyphuspush#0000
I know that hasnt been set yet, but I'd imagine it will be included early in the Governance discussions

 Cool, just wondering. Might be a situation in the future where someone wants to put something up for vote and wants to turn on anon voting and/or anon conversation. Not necessary, but I could see how that would be awesome to have around at some point

 Yah. If I build in anon individual voting I should be able to push it to the vote itself at some point too.

Sigmanauts NFT verification to enter the application. We'll obviously need an Augmented Reality tab so when we're at meetups we can find which room to go to because it'll have a Sigmanauts logo out front only shown for the person with the NFT + AR vision. The lock on the door opens with the NFT.

Ya I can see that also, seems like this tool @drehaf is building could also be worthwhile for Ergo Nation to take a look at, I like anon voting for some topics occasionally - probably be the best way to release a Sigmanaut from the program in the future (cause I would'nt want to know the name of who would vote me out ;))

Good morning all. QQ about the voting app...Will there be a way to track that a person has voted, regardless of how they voted? Just thinking of how we might want to keep voting records (just participation, not actual vote) to evaluate participation levels...wondering if anonymous voting would allow for that at all.


[11/08/2022 12:03 PM] sisyphuspush#0000

 Yes. Vote data segment will know who voted. When u create an account it also creates a anon ID behind the scenes. That string is current Unix epoch * rand(). When u check the box it records and displays that number when u vote instead of your user ID. The system, at this point, still knows you voted as it‚Äôs the only way to stop you from voting twice. When vote is closed I can strip the vote data of that number and just leave the word anon in its place.

 Using the BC would make it a little harder to be anon.  But I want to somehow integrate dapp as well as BC voting next round yes.

think you could use the lowercase sigma font and apply the surrounding lines like you did in v3 of your logo? see how that looks?

"The small letter sigma (œÉ) is used to represent standard deviation in math and statistics. It is also used to show syllable in linguistic, a shielding constant in chemistry and sum of divisors in math."

(re @kushti_ru : *I heard there are some talks about sigmanauts treasury, any tools for managing it considered ?*) 
 
 we started a governance workgroup that's meeting Sundays @ 14UTC. 

a lot to consider overall with a structure and we're still working on voting procedures and things like mission statement (which seems finished)

@dadreboi has a voting app he's been working on. 

Treasury-side I'm not sure how we should go about it. input is always welcome


[11/10/2022 10:03 PM] CW#0000
a number of options, ZK Treasury, MultiSig, Paideia etc


[11/10/2022 10:03 PM] crandano#0000

 Who‚Äôs knows it best @seedubya ? that we can harvest some experience from?


[11/10/2022 10:22 PM] crandano#0000
The reason it would interest me to see how the Ergo Foundation is being setup and managing funds etc is because that may be a similar route that we would like to take 

I've mentioned this before and the conversation seems to die down a bit when we get to this point: 

Understandably, Ergo is highly cypherpunk-minded. The problem in my view is that some people within Sigmanauts are tied to their real world identity. I'd think once we start handling value via a Treasury and making decisions on how to utilize those funds that some people may become wary about participation - at least I would be depending on the jurisdiction and how they've handled their online identity (anonymous, pseudonymous, known identity). Depending on various factors, we may all be thinking about how to structure the program overall very differently and I think it's worth probing all ideas including what's the best legal way to currently structure a DAO.

Thoughts?

(re @dadreboi : *Well sheesh. I wasn‚Äôt worried until u said something.*) 
 
 haha, just being transparent with my thinking - and if we're setting up a governance work group there are a lot of tough questions to contemplate and to weigh pros and cons

Sure, we're experimenting, and in a perfect world I wouldn't worry about it - but... yep.


[11/10/2022 10:33 PM] dadreboi#0000
Who currently manages EFs treasury?


[11/10/2022 10:38 PM] dadreboi#0000
My worry is there are currently under 6 people talking about this and that leaves a lot of holes. But that‚Äôs temporary of course. So the more experienced people we have come in early on the better I think. People with experience that can help with some guidance.


[11/10/2022 10:38 PM] crandano#0000
(re @Ile : *The regulatory push will only get harder. At least in US, EU and other aligned countries.

Any work around truly decentralized systems will be under pressure.

The means will be by identifying pockets of centralized control. Same tool works for building truly decentralized system and regulator/ law enforcement.

So, all I can suggest to aspiring DAOs out there is to have a strategy. Either be ready to comply, and be proactive about it. Or build anon, resilient from the start.*) 
 
 earlier conversation example @dadreboi if you scroll up and down a bit around here. Ile and Klaus, in my opinion, always have a lot of great insights in the various chats i'm in

 you'll find in a lot of projects once these subjects are brought up it's hard to find dedicated people to think about laying a solid foundation for a DAO. I'll bring some links to solid articles I've found to the meeting on Sunday

 Ok lemme work on channels. We should also define this week what working groups other than gov we should get going too. I‚Äôll post agenda template in a few too.

[11/10/2022 10:46 PM] crandano#0000
(re @dadreboi : *If we don‚Äôt get other groups defined then the gov group will turn into doing everything.*) 
 
 yep, a lot of projects do a Marketing, Process, Treasury, and Governance Work Groups

big thing that I've been learning is don't burn yourself out (talking to everyone here). it's easy to find yourself spread thin and trying to be everywhere because things are so interesting. we're talking about Sigmanauts alone here and there's a ton of work needing to be done. once you start getting involved and interested in other projects...

just throwing it out there. find a balance everyone. I see a lot of people burn out

so easy to have a lot of passion in this space. tons of problems needing hashed out, weighing pros and cons, experimenting.

so, if we have 6 members that are dedicated to a working group - that's great. not everyone here is wanting to dig into Governance. that's why there should be different working groups that people are passionate in and want to contribute in

 That is about offchain part, yeah, for any spending more than 50 percent support around all the EF members is needed, then treasurer can send funds out of the hot wallet. Periodically hot wallet is loaded from the treasury contract.

Can the rule for this (and other sigmanaut exclusive) channels be changed so as to prevent new members from being able to see the history prior to their joining?

Can help to avoid awkward situations where a new sigmanaut can go read any historic chatter about themselves without requiring anyone to manually modify that user's permissions to view those comments.

Also fwif, @glasgowm you're criticism of my posting thiswas very warrented.

https://www.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/comments/oxvipl/there_is_inconclusive_evidence_of_selfish_mining/

Since then I have been attempting to do do more research and better understand my assumptions before making public comments.

It was an absolute lapse of judgement and I appreciate you pointing it out.

[11/13/2022 6:13 PM] dadreboi#0000
if we stick to polite discourse and discuss ideas and their merits and not the people platforming them, i think it should take care of it. anything above that could be in a breakout DM

If we had a current events kanban or some other live document to orient new sigmanauts on our current thinking it would not be neccisary.

It is a very fair point.

Another counter argument to add to yours: Sigmanauts should come equipped with the maturity to accept criticism. Censoring past comments should be unneeded.


[11/13/2022 6:15 PM] dadreboi#0000
right...and i'm glad you mention that. there is a small breakout team that will work on onboarding docs and mission statement etc...would you like to pair up?

[11/13/2022 6:33 PM] NoahErgo#0000
some of the most interesting topics are shared there but not a lot of vsibility on other channels so was thinking this could be a cool idea

Would it push everything or able to only push things that are flagged?

I guess flagging would imply curation which is not ideal.

@Sigmanauts 
**SIGMANAUTS MEETING NOTES 11/13/22**

**Followed up with action items from last week:**

- @JŒµnniŒµ D , @WilfordGrimley , @Sisyphuspush  (some or all) will be working in a breakout group with the following, please DM them if you want to participate:
    - Mission Statement
    - Onboarding info/material to help new sigcans and sigmanauts
    - Define the Sigmanaut (and Sigcan for that matter) and make that more visible. 

- Establish SIGCAN and Sigmanaut voting ONLY once a quarter (with remarkable exceptions).
     - In the sigvote app create a new page for sigcan apps that will auto create a vote.
     - Once a quarter for 14 days the sigcans/sigmanauts would be voted in and onboarded and push notifications would be active for reminders for these votes from the app.
     - This would drastically reduce the repetitiveness of onboarding one-offs as well as a barrage of push notifications from the voting app
     - The voting app can handle this, I just need to add it.

- Formation of three subcommittees asap
    - Channels being created in discord tonight with sig permissions (telegram link soon after)
        - Governance (already formed)
        - Media/Social (TWITTER control and designation, for sigs, sigcans, language channels/groups)
        - Treasury
    - If you are interested please reach out in that channel after creation.


**New Items Discussed This Week:**

- Bring in Glasgow (administrative), CW (social), Kushti (dev) for a meeting or two so that we can calibrate our direction a little better from their experience.

- Discussed anon reputation a little bit and how it will be difficult to determine when and how to prune inactive members considering some voting will be anon and other members may be helping out in ways that can't be recorded with metrics. Temp solution was perhaps an active and inactive sigmanaut role/chat. 

- Spoke with Glasgow in DM about what core ecosystem members are/do which helps clear up roles/responsibilities initially a bit.

- Voting app suggested that it allows for changing votes if new information is presented and the vote has not closed. It was agreed in the meeting and I will move forward to allow for that in this v1 of the app. Considering you are now unable to see who voted for what, just the total, this should not affect results but give the freedom for changing your mind with new evidence.

Good day Sigmanauts! Getting caught up on things and saw the tweet from @Chris Ray recapping the Gov. Group meeting and the chats about Twitter account getting set up and active.


[11/14/2022 3:30 PM] drehaf#0090
i think CW is just waiting on the twitter id to come to him


[11/14/2022 3:30 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
I propose that we hold off on being more "public" until we get some of the things we discussed in the meeting ironed out and implemented


[11/14/2022 3:30 PM] drehaf#0090
i think we can still be general about our meetings tho


[11/14/2022 3:31 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
I say that as someone who wants this to be as accessible as possible


[11/14/2022 3:31 PM] drehaf#0090
there's only 30 or so sigs in this chat tho


[11/14/2022 3:32 PM] drehaf#0090
those r the only people seeing our meeting updates unless we post some progress


[11/14/2022 3:32 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
I say that for a few reasons...


[11/14/2022 3:35 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
As we become more public, I think it best suits the program to be organized on a certain level rather than having to explain things on a case by case basis. Having things like Mission Statement,  Definition of Sigmanaut, landing page for more info, etc will present a clearer image and give better context for any other messaging


[11/14/2022 3:36 PM] drehaf#0090
can you type in here what you would have said in the tweet? or not at all?


[11/14/2022 3:37 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Having procedures in place for new SigCans and timelines will allow for more actionable messaging for people who are inspired by it


[11/14/2022 3:39 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
I dont think there is anything wrong with the tweet, per se. It, along with the Twitter handle launch got me thinking about how many Ergonauts in the community will 1st hear about the program, and how we would like that impression to be.


[11/14/2022 3:40 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Are we directing them to current sign up page?


[11/14/2022 3:40 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967

As much transparency as possible is going to eliminate problems in the future, ya some things ought to be generalized - thought I did pretty good at that - but if questions come for clarification probably ought not hold much back, even in a state of organizing can't really go wrong putting too much out there

How do you push someone into the SIgCan role if they met all req's?


[11/15/2022 3:07 AM] drehaf#0090
@Sigmanauts 3 current votes up in #operational for sigcans! get those voting fingers working and or ask about them if you don't know who they are please.


[11/15/2022 3:08 AM] drehaf#0090
it's a role in the server settings you add them to

I will make chuckedup to a SigCan later today, since he has 13 upvotes. If anyone wants to comment before I do that (last comment happened 18 days ago), here is the voting link:

[11/18/2022 1:52 AM] dadreboi#0000
@NoahErgo ever use Audix? I have an Audix VX5 that i use for live shows and absolutly love it.

[11/18/2022 5:52 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
I still don't have sigmachat.app working but can host a Jitsi instance of the server and plug it into the matrix homeserver. The main Jitsi instance would be faster in all likelyhood but it is something to consider long term.


[11/18/2022 5:54 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124

[11/20/2022 3:51 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
So Ive brought this idea to several ergonauts and a few others and Id like to run it by all of you. As a lot of you know, Book.io is exploding within the CNFT scene and is currently trending on the jpg.store. I was thinking of two possible scenarios that could bring exposure, education and funding to the EF. One being publishing the Ergo Manifesto on book.io. The second scenario I have in mind would be the two documents pinned to my twitter profile regarding an educational text that could be published. I could even post the documents here and give you all editor access and you guys could add stuff that you think is beneficial etc. I dont have a ton of knowledge on how the artwork/cover rarity works on Book.io and I dont know much about minting on that platform either. Anyways, im just spitballing here but let me know what you guys think.


[11/20/2022 3:54 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I know a lot of us want to keep Ergo education free, and Idk how this would work, but if we all decided to go ahead with this and wanted it to be a free mint or have book.io airdrop the text that would be cool too. I in no way want to profit from this but I think it could be a cool sigmanaut initiative.


[11/20/2022 1:33 PM] drehaf#0090
Interesting. R u coming in 30 mins and can chat about this in more detail?

Not sure how true this is Wilford I know you mentioned Mastodon so just figured I‚Äôd forward it. Of course I think Ergo should have presence on all forms of socials and still think it‚Äôs a great idea

(re @dadreboi : *in hindsight it looks like he should have joined a different server from the start*) 
 
 good find. so looks like if you join a server they can ban you and it can screw you on moving to a different server. interesting


[11/21/2022 1:49 AM] WilfordGrimley#0124
That a server host can ban or censor you is one of the core motivations for having a Fediverse in the first place. Whether it is a billionaire like Elon Must or your everyday Nazi mod, the fact that an oppressed user can simply move to a new host or ideally self-host their own instances of services like Mastodon, Matrix, PeerTube, etc means that as decentralization increases, the risk of censorship decreases across the Fediverse.

Yes there will be political extremist hosts on the Fediverse on any side of any political spectrum that you can imagine. Federation means that if you find a host that you align with they can selectively (or indiscriminately) federate with other hosts to improve the experience for their members.

If everyone self hosts in the Fediverse, everyone can be completely in control of how wide or small their echo chamber is.


[11/21/2022 1:54 AM] dadreboi#0000
so some people might look for hosts that connect to a lot of other hosts to broaden their reach?

üíØ 

[11/21/2022 1:55 AM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Yep, that is how the fediverse is designed to work. It's very very neat.


[11/21/2022 1:57 AM] dadreboi#0000
the downside is that those isolated echo chambers can breed extremism.


[11/21/2022 1:58 AM] WilfordGrimley#0124
I might agree, but argue that it is better than the echo chambers that we have at the moment, that are entirely at the whims of the technocratic establishment.


[11/21/2022 1:59 AM] WilfordGrimley#0124
As well, echo chambers are going to happen anyway, at least this is entirely consent based for all parties.


[11/21/2022 1:59 AM] dadreboi#0000
(re  : *<WilfordGrimley> I might agree, but argue that it is better than the echo chambers that we have at the moment, that are entirely at the whims of the technocratic establishment.*) 
 
 while i agree, typically those people follow the money, and if the majority of consumers lash out they are more inclined to correct.


[11/21/2022 2:01 AM] dadreboi#0000
i'm not saying it's perfect, far from it, just that the court of public opinion has some benefits against those things.


[11/21/2022 2:01 AM] WilfordGrimley#0124
against which things specifically, sorry?


[11/21/2022 2:02 AM] WilfordGrimley#0124
the formation of echo chambers?


[11/21/2022 2:03 AM] dadreboi#0000
against people like musk...i mean, we shall see what happens...he needs money for the platform to survive. it won't survive with only the people that seem to be happy he took it over.


[11/21/2022 2:12 AM] WilfordGrimley#0124
ah.

This is another reason why I personally believe the fediverse will be successful: largely hosts are hosting for free at the moment, most don't even accept donations.
The fediverse is FOSS doing what it does best. 

Central actors with a bottom line can only compete with that by scaling to a point that no one else can afford to keep their servers up. Not only can people afford to keep their servers up but they are doing so ideologically to help reduce central power.

Maybe if Musk and Bezos team up and declare themselves kings of the internet? Convince the WEF to ban personal computers?

I am hopeful for a more decentralized future. The fediverse has the best value proposition I see being offered at the moment.

**Sigmanauts Meeting 11/20/22** 

** Social Media** 
- looking into in addition to Twitter and others, include mastodon social
- tweet deck for sigmanauts https://twitter.com/sigmanauts accessible by qx() who will soon start liking, retweeting, then tweeting.
- planned tweets will be posted in the social channel for feedback
- socials will branch out to 
- the sig update weekly youtube show, first episode next friday
    - pop ups describing who is who when names are mentioned
- ergodesign work on a bio page for who's who in the ecosystem
- looking into dework or similar where 'bounties' or 'tasks' can be tracked and rewarded for sigcans

** Governance** 
- spoke about making missing statement much clearer and more concise, leaving room for visions and value statments. 
- discussion about the difficulty of a mission statement when sigmanauts are individuals and to the mission statements need to be mindful of not making restrictive statements. 
- colab for mission statement here: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J6PdyyxoEEqI0nEr64ZZBGU4Lkr8Cr37GqNSs4qHo7Q/edit?usp=sharing>

** Sigcans/Sigmanauts Program** 
- Voting reconsidered to once a month, 1st of each month (instead of initial proposal for once a quarter)
- qx() will also assist with onboarding documentation
- proposal to allow sponsorship of a sigcan during application process (as well as adding a checkbox for sigs to volunteer to sponsor)
- finish defining a sigmanaut as well as what it actually takes to go from sigcan to sigmanaut
- documentation needed for first time community devs
- question popped to see if sigcans would be able to hold meetings once their roles were more clearly defined, perhaps put out a poll to see how many active sigcans there are w/interest.

** Refine Focus and designate persons to push forward** 
- qx() will focus on social/onboarding/community as well as continuing to motivate and push forward these weekly process meetings  (and the sig monthly, hopefully can convince mark to come to the first one).
- crandano will focus on governance as well as start poking round about a treasury. potentially schedule breakout meetings to work ONLY on governance.

** Voting APP** 
- sigcan intake form is created on the vote site, next step is to blend it into the voting platform. 
- current vote site is ready to have proposals voted on. 

Whelp, lets do it. Please sign up for an account here: 
WARNING: This was written from bottom to top in the perl programming language by me, qx(). The hope is that we work out the kinks and eventually someone writes a real version in node.js or something and I can send my the SQL export of historical data. 
When adding discord or tele notifications (if desired) please put in the NUMBER (instructions on the site to get it from my bots) not the handle. Also, discord warns you that you are 'downloading' a script when clicking the link. If you are worried, hit it from an incognito window. <https://my.ergoport.dev/cgi-bin/ergo/new_user.pl>
After creating a user it will drop you into the list votes page, feel free to hit 'edit user' up top to add your discord or telegram ID Numbers. 

Current voting lasts 7 days and needs 10 or more votes to pass. If you choose not to be DM'd, the system will still post day 1, day 3.5, day 7, and close on day 8 to the #vote channel in sigmanauts. 

For now, I will manually add sigcan applications to the voting until the rest is built.

ü•∫Problem: 
Ergo is thriving with amazing gems, who are flying under the radar due to lack of marketing communications caused by teams' lack of funds / expertise

üòãSolution:
Assign a number of Ergonauts to different Ergo projects, whose aim is to translate devs updates of their assigned project in 

a) easily understandable words and 

b) visually pleasing, professional ways: e.g. well written twitter threads, articles, infographics and or COMPARISONS W/ CARDANO COUNTERPARTS! (e.g. how's Duckpools different from Liqwid Finance?)

üòéExample:
1) I'm assigned to Duckpools.
I ask Duckpools devs questions such as:
-What makes Duckpools unique?
-What are you working on atm?
-Any question that makes me better understand the project

2) I create content in the form of a simple tweet, a twitter thread, or an infographic related to a specific topic e.g. leveraged lending on Duckpools!

üòçResult:
Newbies will learn about Ergo gems who don't have funding to hire marketing teams.

Non-newbies will be kept up to date easily, which in turn will make it easier for them to share such content and get a nice ripple effect

Ready now tho! ;)


[11/23/2022 4:06 AM] drehaf#0090
ok @Sigmanauts I'm trying to make it easier on you...so i worked hard tonight and integrated voting into my bots as well. 

1. Go to <https://my.ergoport.dev/cgi-bin/ergo/new_user.pl> and make a vote account.
2. Add your telegram or discord NUMERICAL id (you have to do this is you want notifications as well as be able to vote via the bot)

**Option 1**
- Vote on the site: <https://my.ergoport.dev/cgi-bin/ergo/list_votes.pl>

**Option 2**
- Vote with bot
Telegram: DM <https://t.me/ergoportbot>
Discord: DM my.ergoport#6220

**Bot Vote Commands:**
**Telegram:**
/ep listvotes
/ep voting 5 yes
where 5 is the id of the submission (shows in listvotes) and "yes" can be "yes, no, or abstain"

**Discord:**
ep listvotes
ep voting 8 abstain
where 8 is the id of the submission (shows in listvotes) and "abstain" can be "yes, no, or abstain"

Bot will stop you from voting twice and will hide votes you've already voted on (it's semi smart). 

There are three sigcan votes up on the site and we are almost halfway through the time limit where they will fail with too few votes. Let's do it!

@drehaf been absent for a bit could you briefly explain what this is about ^


[11/23/2022 5:27 PM] drehaf#0090
one of the things we have been discussing in the sigs meetings is to make voting easier, anon (if desired), archived/searchable, and more automated (closes after vote threshold and or date has been met).

I wrote a program to do all that...
in short:
- Create an account, add discord/tele Numerical ID's
- Submit a vote
- System DM's you on day 1,3.5,7,8 (labeled NEW, REMINDER, FINAL REMINDER, CLOSED) as well as posts to the vote channel (you can see initial ones there now). 
- You can also now list and vote through DMing the bot


[11/23/2022 5:28 PM] drehaf#0090
oh, voting app also allows for anon reasons too


[11/23/2022 5:28 PM] drehaf#0090
so when u vote you can post a reason why you voted that way that isn't linked to your name


[11/23/2022 5:30 PM] drehaf#0090
once twitter unbans my bot when the staff return i can add that again to notify DM's there....as well as simple email notifications when i get SMTP up on the server


[11/23/2022 5:31 PM] drehaf#0090
current votes that have come in via typeform i've been removing and pushing to the sigmavote....
I will soon have the sigcan form done and integrated there as well so we can remove typeform intake for sigs


[11/23/2022 5:53 PM] drehaf#0090
actually, i'm going to add a 4th button to the voting page to allow people to ONLY submit a reason (mini forum)


[11/23/2022 5:55 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967

[11/27/2022 3:12 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
I met the founder of a fairly big NFT project on Cardano and his team; they'll be hosting Ergo x Cardano spaces as well as friendly competitions between the two communities: poker games, chess, and so on


[11/27/2022 3:13 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
This will help with introducing Cardanians to Ergo in a less shilly way and lets us handhold them with the basics: wallets to use, where to get ERG etc

(re @HQ3rr : *It helps to creat a buzz and attract more eyes*) 
 
 Lots of things can achieve that, but building something that complex when the community is so small doesn't seem very efficient imo

 Best for that kind of thing would be a gaming portal with team of chains and compete with each other


[11/27/2022 3:15 PM] HQ3rr#0000
With simple games  likes ,poker,chess


[11/27/2022 3:15 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
There are Discord bots that do that, they're used a lot in the Cardano NFT space

[11/27/2022 3:15 PM] HQ3rr#0000
And then ,maybe do the real world events


[11/27/2022 3:30 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
With Rosen bridge, it should be relatively simple to get NFTs from other networks with native token support over a bridge onto Ergo.

If we had a Geocaching like dApp that was designed well enough, projects on other chains may be incentivized to bring their NFTs and communities to our chain to participate, and provide exposure for their projects.

 Requires investment and we don't have that, topic closed


[11/27/2022 3:32 PM] HQ3rr#0000
I will draw some sketches of a "ATM" marketing machine for events


[11/27/2022 3:32 PM] HQ3rr#0000
Where people have to creat wallet, and dapp connect, do a quiz on ergo and at end claim a reward


[11/27/2022 3:33 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
I don't know about topic closed, but it is certainly not something that should be in our immediate focus. üòâ

[11/27/2022 3:33 PM] HQ3rr#0000
Which can be there picture taken on the device they did the quiz on, and gets mintnted in the backend


[11/27/2022 3:33 PM] HQ3rr#0000
And they get it as an nft


[11/27/2022 3:33 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Very cool.


[11/27/2022 3:33 PM] HQ3rr#0000
I can do the idea, developing guys should tell me if it's possible or not


[11/27/2022 3:34 PM] HQ3rr#0000
And maybe drop ergo ads on the main screen to showcase the projects


[11/27/2022 3:35 PM] HQ3rr#0000
Dapp connected with qr is possible right?


[11/27/2022 3:56 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Yes, look up ErgoPay


[11/27/2022 4:02 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
QR codes are just a standard for storing small amounts of data, usually text. They can be incorporated into anything.

(re  : *<WilfordGrimley> QR codes are just a standard for storing small amounts of data, usually text. They can be incorporated into anything.*) 
 
 Now, direct mint from camera app is also possible I think


[11/27/2022 4:12 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Have to pay a fee to mint, or be minting from your own node.

May be easier to trigger minting from a smart contract that can cover the minting fee, mass premint, etc.


[11/27/2022 4:12 PM] HQ3rr#0000
Trying to sketch some ideas for marketing on event and want to sketch a app 
Step 1 : what is ergo? Small quiz at end .‚úÖ
Step 2 : creat wallet (qr code to ergo wallet app) ‚úÖ
Step 3 : dapp connect ( can be done with qr code scan)‚úÖ
Step 4 : explore the ergo ecosystem‚úÖ
Step 5 : more quiz.‚úÖ
Step 6 : get a reward ( reward = a photo taken from the device camera which gets minted and transfered to the connect address)‚úÖ

Mgpais python script can mint nfts. I use it in my payroll app.  U just give it a seed phase to pay for the mint which u can just store in a db. Scanning qr could trigger the creation if gps is in location.

 If I figure out Ajax for Perl I can build interactive pages and do this fairly easily. Time is the issue tho.

I met the founder of a fairly big NFT project on Cardano and his team; they'll be hosting Ergo x Cardano spaces as well as friendly competitions between the two communities: poker games, chess, and so on

@Sigmanauts 
Notes for today's meeting. Please let me know if I've missed anything or misquoted, it's been a long day of driving üòâ

Sigmanauts Meeting Notes 11/27/22 2pm UTC

Joined by Mark!
Asked Mark about the role of the EF in the future as well as Sig history.
    - EF was always intended to not last forever in its current state.
    - Discussions were had at some point to potentially have the EF turn into a research only unit.
    - Other discussions were had on how legal matters may be managed (like listings etc.) if the EF were not handling it.
    - Noted that Sigmanauts (started about a year ago) interest seemed to come and go with the price.
    - Asked if they had considered of other methods of funding to sustain the EF long into the future.
    - Mark suggested to make a text guide (and maybe video) for voting app.

Follow ups from previous meetings
    - Ergcube working on notable members of the community, qx() will give him a list of people to start out with.
    - Mission statement work ongoing. Sis, Cran, Wil reiterated that it should remain short and clear leaving room for other documents such as a vision statement.  
    - Onboarding - qx() will work on identifying the gaps and reach back out to Caf√© or others to see if he has time to fill them.
    - Voting app out and live, will follow Marks suggestion to make a guide (qx)

Treasury
    - Discussion about open collective and how best to proceed with legal needs moving forward.
    - Get support of projects that would donate mining rewards (some of their tokens) to GetBlok miners of the future Sigmanauts pool for initial incentive. 
    - Use discord to auto post treasury spending

Social
    - Brainstormed a little on engagement ideas
    - Main idea was to develop a campaign plan
        Involve upcoming ecosystem projects and cover their news and releases
        Have the weeks tweets pretty planned out in advance

Getblok - Creating a sub pool for treasury and using lgd's (Luca) app.
    - Wilford was wondering if getblok already has this capability. 
    -Luca: it‚Äôs a dapp plugin getblok could use so when the payouts happen the treasury could automatically get a percentage in ERG and another in SigUSD without someone having to do the swap manually.
    - qx spoke with Luca and was reminded that getblok does not do swapping. They are able to pay in other tokens simply because that project gives them the tokens. Lucas app would enable getblok to swap to sigusd or utilize . 

Grassroots IRL initiatives
    - Guerrilla Stickers (check out this that was posted a year ago: <https://www.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/comments/okc8lb/ergo_guerrilla_marketing_toolkit/> )
    - Meetups
    - Attend other events with possible like minded people and bring along cards/pamphlets/info
    - Paper wallets for tipping people (give someone a paper wallet on top of a normal tip with some tokens in it)
    - GeoCache network. Build NFT's and hide QR codes to release said NFT's when you scan it at the found location.
    - HQ proposed a quiz with rewards
    - Cran proposed dword for tasks (re-mention)

The Sigma Update
    - First show went well, will make sure to post RoS ahead of time for feedback.
    - Taking Armeanio's advice and will try to get a dev on as often as possible!

Thanks all! See you next Sunday!

 Dealing with some hard times at home and hope to be back soon with bandwidth to work on the program, might jump in sporadically and get crandano to jump start the Gov sub just to push it before it falls into the cracks, thx for the minutes!

Any recommendations from the sigmanuats on the best way to choose the DEXY logo?


[11/29/2022 12:17 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Let sigmanauts nominate logos, then run a poll in the broader community. Rank choice if possible


[11/29/2022 12:18 AM] dadreboi#0000
(re @Armeanio : *Any recommendations from the sigmanuats on the best way to choose the DEXY logo?*) 
 
 didn't you have a submission period already?


[11/29/2022 12:30 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I know AnetaBTC just held a logo content with prizes. Might be a good way to do it?


[11/29/2022 12:30 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Willing to through an Ergo Champion in the pool.

Theres some fantastic artists in the community.


[11/29/2022 12:30 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Might be fun to see what they come up with.


[11/29/2022 1:12 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
There are a ton of logos already made

 Maybe you're in the wrong channel? There's loads of them


[11/29/2022 1:38 AM] dadreboi#0000
Yah. I remember almost making one back then. Pretty sure he‚Äôs asking how the selection process should work, not the submission.  

Creating a non writable channel, drop in one at a time, and people thumbs up what they like, winner is whoever has most thumbs. That‚Äôs pretty quick and easy.


[11/29/2022 1:39 AM] dadreboi#0000
But not anon.


[11/29/2022 1:47 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Seems easy enough. But a Google form might give rank choice voting. If we can narrow it down to 10 or so that would be manageable


[11/29/2022 1:47 AM] dadreboi#0000
Yah. Good point


[11/29/2022 1:48 AM] dadreboi#0000
Can someone look in original posting? Who did they say were voting on design? Community? Or ef w/sigs?

Wonder if there would be a way to hold a live voting event. If there was a way to snapshot people‚Äôs reactions in zoom as an image was shown. Big promotions for a new stable coin. A brief welcome with rules, followed by Live voting on the design. Followed by closing remarks about the tech.

 Do u have all the roles selected?


[11/29/2022 1:57 AM] dadreboi#0000
Someone can make polls in zoom actually ahead of time for each design.


[11/29/2022 1:57 AM] dadreboi#0000
When design comes up on screen u push the poll


[11/29/2022 1:58 AM] dadreboi#0000

I like the love event, but it would limit the number of participants. Things I've done in the past lasted a week and got lots of input


[11/29/2022 2:06 AM] dadreboi#0000
How do u think we could engage the most?


[11/29/2022 2:11 AM] dadreboi#0000
U mean limit as in not everyone can make a zoom at a set time kinda thing?

Let's see if I can get in touch with Mike from audio swamp who is doing php dapp connector


[11/29/2022 11:42 AM] HQ3rr#0000
And we can creat something more decentralized


[11/29/2022 11:43 AM] dadreboi#0000
Perhaps people can be nominated by the community.  And then a panel decides.


[11/29/2022 11:45 AM] Gazza_SP#0000

[11/29/2022 11:45 AM] HQ3rr#0000
(re @dadreboi : *Perhaps people can be nominated by the community.  And then a panel decides.*) 
 
 Yup,we can do a community poll on tg for nominations


[11/29/2022 11:45 AM] Gazza_SP#0000
It was hard to get engagement though I think


[11/29/2022 11:45 AM] HQ3rr#0000
And then we do a voting on site


[11/29/2022 11:45 AM] dadreboi#0000

 Tell me about it lol.


[11/29/2022 11:45 AM] Gazza_SP#0000

On a similar note, am also trying to organize an NFT awards event for the EOY. Can have various categories that community makes submissions for, after which the top ones are presented to everyone for final votes. Categoried would be ones like: Artist of year,  project of year, best artwork, favorite utility, best website, etc


[11/29/2022 11:58 AM] HQ3rr#0000
Maybe ,get them a free mint for month of auction house....


[11/29/2022 11:58 AM] HQ3rr#0000

(re @kushti_ru : *Why old Twitter inactive ?*) 
 
 The name renames to sigmanauts? Getting bunch of sigmas to use it , right now qx is only rt stuff


[11/29/2022 10:04 PM] HQ3rr#0000
There is a procedure and points to take care off etc... Working on groups to make it more smoother


[11/29/2022 10:20 PM] dadreboi#0000
(re @kushti_ru : *Why old Twitter inactive ?*) 
 
 Yes. Working on a bunch of tweets for starting next Monday. Planning it all ahead as per the groups suggestion. Will post them here and would love your feedback ;). CWs been keeping it alive for now with some RTs as well.


[11/29/2022 10:20 PM] Armeanio#0000
(re @dadreboi : *didn't you have a submission period already?*) 
 
 Yeah we have a bunch of logo. What would be the best "fair" way to pick a winner. 

We havent been boaty mcboatfaced yet.

yet tm


[11/29/2022 10:22 PM] dadreboi#0000
(re @Armeanio : *yet tm*) 
 
 Ok. I can collect the ideas from here so far and feed them to u. Otherwise we can discuss at the sig meeting on Sunday if u can wait.


[11/29/2022 10:22 PM] Armeanio#0000
We can do a standard form as we have previously but there is also the potential for people to vote multiple times.


[11/29/2022 10:23 PM] dadreboi#0000
(re @Armeanio : *We can do a standard form as we have previously but there is also the potential for people to vote multiple times.*) 
 
 HQ can IP restrict on his site and there were other options to vote in discord and tele too


[11/29/2022 10:23 PM] Armeanio#0000
Rero stress test immenent. üòé


[11/29/2022 10:23 PM] dadreboi#0000
Live event would be cool too


[11/29/2022 10:23 PM] dadreboi#0000
But fear of missing too many people


[11/29/2022 10:24 PM] dadreboi#0000
I can also make a tele and discord bot to record votes


[11/29/2022 10:24 PM] dadreboi#0000
Solutions r endless pretty much


[11/29/2022 10:25 PM] dadreboi#0000
(re @dadreboi : *I can also make a tele and discord bot to record votes*) 
 
 Drop it to a db and record user number so they can‚Äôt vote twice


[11/29/2022 10:25 PM] dadreboi#0000
Not too hard to do

And spectrum


[11/29/2022 10:29 PM] dadreboi#0000
So @Armeanio suggestions were 
- voting bots here (tele) and discord
- hqs site with ratings on each pic
- live event on zoom with polls 
- voting channels here (tele) and discord where u thumbs up the pic u like and can‚Äôt type in it
- google form with login to restrict multi 

All of those will allow for limited spamming.


[11/29/2022 10:31 PM] dadreboi#0000
Either way it‚Äôs An opportunity for exposure event

 Let me make it more interesting, I can setup password to access the ranking area


[11/29/2022 10:49 PM] HQ3rr#0000
If we only want sigmas to vote


[11/29/2022 10:54 PM] dadreboi#0000
I think the intention is community vote.


[11/29/2022 10:58 PM] HQ3rr#0000
(re @dadreboi : *I think the intention is community vote.*) 
 
 Best I can offer is ip restricted to 1 vote


[11/29/2022 11:07 PM] dadreboi#0000
@Armeanio we could also vote with ERGOGAMES dev, it's offchain but allows you to connect wallet (so no double voting), make a selection, and vote.


[11/29/2022 11:10 PM] dadreboi#0000
pretty sure he can make it so no vote tokens needed.


[11/29/2022 11:10 PM] dadreboi#0000
and just assign everyone 1 vote on dapp connection


[11/30/2022 4:05 PM] drehaf#0090

> ErgoScript is the language, this is compiled down to ErgoTree which is a bytecode with call-by-value semantics. Evaluating this is done by a relatively simple interpreter, I guess you could call this the VM.

@Sigmanauts 

How voting works:
1. Proposal is submitted via the Sigmavote website
    - For SIG self submissions, currently the typeform is still active and I create votes from them, I'm working on integrating that into the site tho.
2. A message gets AUTO posted with link within 5 mins to the #üó£‚îÇvote  channel
3. Same message is DM'd to those on Discord and Telegram who opted in
4. After 3.5 days a REMINDER is sent to the endpoints from #2 and #3 above.
5. After 7 days a FINAL REMINDER is sent to the endpoints from #2 and #3 above.
6. After 8 days a VOTE CLOSED is sent to the endpoints from #2 and #3 above.
7. qx() and the social team will welcome the new sigcan/sigmanaut with a message in the channel. 
8. Archived votes with results at the bottom can be shared w/public by copying the top url such as this sample: https://my.ergoport.dev/cgi-bin/ergo/cast_vote.pl?a=1
9. Voting can take place on website, telegram bot, discord bot

example of what the listvotes command looks like. note that it shows i've voted on the first 4 (3,4,5,6) proposals and then shows the last one since I haven't voted on it yet.

[11/30/2022 7:01 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Ergo community members have created an initiative to increase liquidity on P2P trading platform Bisq. Bisq is a decentralized and KYC-free onramp to crypto trading.

(re @NoahErgo : *I think something like

I welcome any suggestions of course


[11/30/2022 7:02 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
we should mention that trading there will give visibility and exposure to true crypto believers. a good match


[11/30/2022 7:02 PM] NoahErgo#0000

Happy Thursday @Sigmanauts.  Tomorrow I will be hosting am ErgoNFT Twitter Space for NFT projects and community to discuss things happening in the ecosystem. I will also be announcing an Ergo NFT Community Awards initiative for EoY. There will be a total of 9 categories that the community can submit nominations for through the end of December.

Will take the top 3 nominations for each category and allow the community to vote on them for the winners.

it means i have to focus on voting now . @qx release the monster ? :D


[12/01/2022 2:01 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Still looking into artists for award, but I thought Nils Dougan would be a good one since they also produce a physical token along with the NFT.


[12/01/2022 2:03 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
The only roadblock I have with that idea is the cost associated with mailing the tokens out to the winners. There will be a total of 10 awards produced. I can cover the cost of making them, but shipping them to winners may be too much for me as it could cost around $500 USD, based on prior shipping of tokens.


[12/01/2022 2:04 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Wanted to get your thoughts on if it would be inappropriate to ask winners to pay for the shipping if they want the physical token along with the NFT, or would it be appropriate cause for an Ergo Raffle?


[12/01/2022 2:24 PM] glasgowm#0000
Think either could work tbh. Don‚Äôt think people would mind paying shipping as an optional extra

How does one set up the password and what restricts multiple account set-up...the IP?

you can only vote ones from your ip

Can I just suggest we move the meeting to 3PM so that it's 7AM west coast USA instead of 6AM? I've wanted to make every meeting, but 6 is exactly when i get up on most days and its hard to change around the sleep cycle

Thank you, wasn't 100% sure either. Tried to reach out to them, but I suppose they aren't that active RN. Wanted to see if I can get a custom variant of the Ergonaut to use as the image for the NFT award.

[12/02/2022 2:04 AM] Chris Ray#2713
oof, I will see if I can get my vote in tonight, I would like to see them a Sig, at some point the lack of voting by our members is really going to be something that reflects whether we with the sigmanaut title are active or not, something to think about for everyone.
Could be good to start a process of defining the steps of what it would take to remove the inactive members so that we can start to hold the title holders somewhat accountable to drive the program forward and begin to set standards of what it means to be in the program.


[12/02/2022 2:05 AM] dadreboi#0000
yeah, we need to iron it out this sunday for sure...i can always pause flip's application after it closes and reopen after the meeting....


[12/02/2022 2:06 AM] Chris Ray#2713
@drehaf is it possible to track the activity of qualified voters in the app - I hate to ask a dumb question but it would be cool if that becomes a source of info for Sigmanauts looking to get someone removed - I have someone in mind to get kicked out.


[12/02/2022 2:07 AM] drehaf#0090
like, to see who has voted?


[12/02/2022 2:07 AM] drehaf#0090
the app knows who voted but was going to implement code to wipe that when the vote closes.


[12/02/2022 2:07 AM] Chris Ray#2713
To have a record, I was just kidding about kicking someone out, lol


[12/02/2022 2:07 AM] drehaf#0090
lol


[12/02/2022 2:08 AM] drehaf#0090
i could also make a now column in the user database...that gets a +1 every time they vote


[12/02/2022 2:08 AM] Chris Ray#2713
We need to keep a record


[12/02/2022 2:08 AM] drehaf#0090
that would show us who's voting but not on what


[12/02/2022 2:08 AM] drehaf#0090

[12/02/2022 2:08 AM] drehaf#0090

[12/02/2022 2:09 AM] drehaf#0090
ok, so lets chat this sun about that as well as splintering a sub group of non voting sigs...because some sigs just might not want to vote but still want to be an active sig...i understand them....


[12/02/2022 2:09 AM] drehaf#0090

 That was a big reason for the abstain vote and monthly voting plans


[12/02/2022 2:11 AM] sisyphuspush#0000
I think once the tools and procedures are in place, it will be easier to identify expectations to remain active


[12/02/2022 2:12 AM] drehaf#0090
right, abstain was this reason...good PoV


[12/02/2022 2:15 AM] Chris Ray#2713
Let me share some experience on voting in a semi decentralized environment I have been familiar with for the last 30 years on voting - if the participants missed 3 months of meetings (Role is recorded at the beginning) then you must attend 3 consecutive months of meetings before your vote is counted again - pretty heavy, an absence can be sponsored by a full standing voter - but if challenged a second  voter must second the absence to allow it.
