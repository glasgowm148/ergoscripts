I see over on Medium, ErgoPos is still active in development.  Could you give me a short overall evaluation of their chances of producing a real product.  Thanks for the update

Tabby App
Crypto coins plummeted today, so we had to release it quietly
Google Play Store Link : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kolmentech.tabby

A few simple statements are made here:

1. This is only a test version, the ERG inside the app is also used for testing.

2. Tabby is only an app for storing small amount of ERG (Pocket Money), it is not suitable for large amount of transactions.

3. This test uses the lowest, cheapest server, so if there is slow or even down, you need to be patient. We will gradually improve the efficiency of the server.

4. The main goal of this test is to test the stability of APP. 

5. this test did not put security in the first place.

6. Finally, I hope you can give a little advice gently.

(re @glasgowm : *What is ‘instant transfer’ and how does it work?*) 
 
 No secret actually. Work concept like CEX. Deposit from ergo chain to ErgoPOS’s liquidity. Transaction work on our server, withdraw  from server back to ergo chain.

(re @lkching7 : *No secret actually. Work concept like CEX. Deposit from ergo chain to ErgoPOS’s liquidity. Transaction work on our server, withdraw  from server back to ergo chain.*)

Great app. Now how to test it. I should send some of the test erg to someone. Problem is people don't want to dox themselves here.


[03/10/2023 1:53 PM] lkching7#0000
(re @slasherzx : *Great app. Now how to test it. I should send some of the test erg to someone. Problem is people don't want to dox themselves here.*) 
 
 Actually the Target Audient of this APP is not from this community. This app is meant to attract people from outside, to get people who don't have much knowledge of blockchain to use it and get them into the ERGO world without even realising it. 

Please give me a little more time while I prepare the whole business strategy, and then I will present it to you.

So if you want to test it, try using two phones. Or you can send it to me (lkching7@gmail.com)


[03/10/2023 1:56 PM] lkching7#0000
(re @slasherzx : *Great app. Now how to test it. I should send some of the test erg to someone. Problem is people don't want to dox themselves here.*) 
 
 The Tabby App is more like a membership app than a wallet. Merchants will credit points (ERG) to the user's Tabby App.

(re @lkching7 : *The Tabby App is more like a membership app than a wallet. Merchants will credit points (ERG) to the user's Tabby App.*) 
 
 Thanks for the explanation. So far it looks great. Waiting for how it would be used.

i fell asleep because no projects gave updates on anything for quite a while....


[04/03/2023 4:34 AM] Wesley#0000
i had ergoPOS vesting and could see my value on ergopad.  Now, I cannnot.  I have my vesting key still but cannot find any info anywhere as too when they are "vested" an what I must do to attain the tkens


[04/03/2023 4:44 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
Did you redeem them?


[04/03/2023 4:45 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
You may have redeemed them all


[04/03/2023 4:45 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
This team does bi-weekly updates actually. And yield farming will start really soon


[04/03/2023 4:53 AM] Wesley#0000
how do i redeem them?


[04/03/2023 4:53 AM] Wesley#0000
i just have my vesting key in my wallet


[04/03/2023 4:53 AM] Wesley#0000
is t tooo llate?


[04/03/2023 5:01 AM] Wesley#0000
i know you're only worth 1.75653594 percent my original 2,500 dollar pre-vesting buy, but now you can't even show up for my 43 bucks?


[04/03/2023 5:03 AM] Wesley#0000
850 ergo when it was 2.80.  280 ergo down to 30ish


[04/03/2023 5:05 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
> (re @Wesley : *is t tooo llate?*)
         
        No, if you haven't redeemed them just use the ergopad dashboard


[04/03/2023 5:05 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
But if you have redeemed them that would be why your vesting key is visible in your wallet but not on the vesting panel


[04/03/2023 5:08 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
If that's not the case and it's an issue on our dashboard, you can contact @theta_decay and he can take a look at your wallet to see what's happening. If there's an issue on our end we'll get it fixed

Hi ErgoPOS Family.
To make our project more widely known and to integrate with other cryptocurrency chains, we plan to follow other projects by renaming our ErgoPOS to TabbyPOS, with a grey cat(tabby) as our logo. Therefore, we will be changing our website, Telegram, and Twitter logos to that of a grey cat(tabby). We apologize to any members of our community who may not be fond of cats, but we believe that this adorable tabby represents our project's friendly and dependable qualities.

Miau miau


[04/17/2023 1:52 PM] thecolj#0000
Have you considered $TPOS? Tabby POS carrying $EPOS ticker doesn't align cleanly with the new rebrand & may actually prove confusing.

        Replacing the token would be extra work, wouldn’t do it

[04/24/2023 3:06 AM] Zach | Picaro#5270

Instant transfer alongside transfers that take a minute?
Instant transfers are just that, instant.


[04/24/2023 3:10 AM] Zach | Picaro#5270
Also might be worth saying *what* is being transferred..


[04/24/2023 3:15 AM] Thirdstryker#0000
No transaction free lol 😆

        actually is "second" typo.

(re @Thirdstryker : *What do I do with my ergoPOS tokens?*)
        
        Initially, EPOS tokens were used to cover users' withdrawal fees, and transaction fees were free to attract more users. The strategy of implementing "transaction fees" would only be carried out after there were sufficient numbers of users.
