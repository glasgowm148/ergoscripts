what card has the noctua coolers, and is it all just ziptie? I dig it

Was wondering the same - good fans those too


[10/13/2021 4:25 PM] SnowPea#7485
Its the 3060ti lhr, i accidentally broke the stock fan. While i ordered a replacement and not sure how long it would take to arrive, i saw people using these noctua fans for it, so i bought two and gave it a try. Im just using regular zip ties to hold them, as long as they are not touching any metal, they wont melt. As for the fans, i tried to plug the power directly on the card, but since it needs 12w for each fan, the card couldnt provide enough power for the fans to go full rpm (1500), so i plugged them directly onto the mobo. The downside is that i could control the fan speed in msi or trex, so i just set them at full speed all the time. I'd say they are pretty quiet at full speed, but if i used the noise reduce cable, which only limited the speed up to 1200rpm, they would be super quiet. As far as the temp, they did bring the temp down for 1~2c, not a lot but they worked. I think if i put a couple more on the side of the rack, that would create a better airflow, but for now thats enough, never gone pass 55c on the hottest summer day.

Unfortunately that x4 slot was the one that was having issue (i had my 3060 there and it crashed every few minute), it didnt have any issues after i l moved it to the 4th slot. I'll need to get a splitter if i ever get a 4th card


[10/13/2021 5:40 PM] geezar#8187
4th GPU.... and so it continues üç∫

This my little baby


[10/13/2021 5:45 PM] SnowPea#7485
Looks nice, hows the temp/airflow working out for you? the cards look pretty packed up


[10/13/2021 5:48 PM] Zuqerberg#4722
Ive been switching setup a million times but this works pretty well. Like i had a normal case before and they got superhot pretty fast, i tried cabling out but that also was a bit clunky. Also tried the same techniques with this new case i recently got in the pic and its working put pretty good


[10/13/2021 5:49 PM] Zuqerberg#4722
If i remember correctly i have 59 on the first card and 52 on the second one running 63% on the fan


[10/13/2021 5:50 PM] Zuqerberg#4722
The case also came with a tempered glass panel for the front but obviously that got too hot for the cards


[10/13/2021 5:58 PM] Ananas#9063
@Zuqerberg such an interesting setup, didnt know open air cases were a thing. whats the model number?


[10/13/2021 5:59 PM] Zuqerberg#4722
Thermaltake core p3 snow i recall correctly


[10/13/2021 5:59 PM] Zuqerberg#4722
I might try getting my hands on more gpus closer to 2022 but things aint all that easy as a student ahha


[10/13/2021 6:00 PM] Zuqerberg#4722
But absolutely recommend the case


[10/13/2021 6:13 PM] SnowPea#7485
@Zuqerberg it looks really nice and neat!

[10/13/2021 6:14 PM] SnowPea#7485
Im noticing my gpu fans are getting dusty, i'll probably have to clean the fans once a year

Can that be wall mounted or just a vertical case - nice design


[10/13/2021 6:37 PM] Zuqerberg#4722
Can both be laid down flat and wall mounted

Also, gpu bracket can be flipped and set up for horizontal mounting

Anything with the screenshot?


[10/13/2021 8:33 PM] Dv#3650
Yes the triple 8 pin is kinda of annoying, but they run a lot cooler than fes


[10/13/2021 8:48 PM] Herk#6019
can‚Äôt quite compare any card to the FE when it comes to cooling.. specially the evga‚Äôs


[10/13/2021 11:46 PM] Dv#3650
Why can't I?


[10/14/2021 12:19 AM] Herk#6019
FE cooling is inferior


[10/14/2021 12:19 AM] Herk#6019
to pretty much anything


[10/14/2021 12:20 AM] Herk#6019
pads are also poop


[10/14/2021 1:29 AM] Dv#3650
Yea I know that's why I mentioned it running cooler than the fes. Saying that the trade off for the extra 8 pin is lower thermals.

Made this rig today just to make sure the budget setup idea works


[10/14/2021 10:14 PM] Ananas#9063
8 rig setup, one small ATX psu, 1200w hp psu, second hand 18 euro half config mobo I bought


[10/14/2021 10:15 PM] Ananas#9063
All in all less than 200 EUR for everything included


[10/14/2021 10:15 PM] Ananas#9063
Except the cards ofc


[10/14/2021 10:15 PM] Ananas#9063
Suggestions/critiques welcome


[10/14/2021 10:20 PM] Ananas#9063
next step is to find a relatively cheap mobo that has 4 pcie slots so I can do 4 pcie splitters on it in total


[10/15/2021 7:24 AM] Runstyle#5968
looks sweet bro, i almos tthought it was a riserless mobo for a split sec ahahaha


[10/15/2021 7:40 AM] Ananas#9063
Haha I can see it. If I have extra time today I will remake the rig into a hanging one, to see if I can fit the 2 psus and the mobo on the shelf


[10/15/2021 9:50 AM] geezar#8187
I like that @Ananas one question - are you intending on using the top shelf for more GPUs? - if not maybe consider spacing the cards out and running a couple higher to give them more space in between each GPU - the radiant heat from each would get toasty, the hot air also rises but the spacing would offset that - sweet rig tho üëç


[10/15/2021 9:51 AM] geezar#8187
Perfect example of a lower cost and efficient rig, not everyone can go for baller 30 series - love rigs like this üíØ


[10/15/2021 10:21 AM] Ananas#9063
Thanks! Yes, I intend to use the top, and also stack another identical shelf on this one. So it will be 4 levels total, instead of the 2 now. Space between GPUs isnt an issue, as the 12cm fans blowing from directly behind them are 3800 RPM 12 watt fans that move 300 m3/h


[10/15/2021 10:22 AM] Ananas#9063

[10/16/2021 10:56 AM] Ananas#9063
How are temps looking? I think its suboptimal to not have a fan blowing inbetween the cards


[10/16/2021 10:56 AM] Dv#3650

[10/16/2021 11:01 AM] Ananas#9063
Have you tried placing the tower fan to aim that way?


[10/16/2021 11:01 AM] Dv#3650
Aim which way?


[10/16/2021 11:01 AM] Ananas#9063
To blow towards where the red arrows point


[10/16/2021 11:02 AM] Dv#3650
Ohh no I have not


[10/16/2021 11:02 AM] Ananas#9063
Pretty sure you have small hot air bubbles between cards


[10/16/2021 11:02 AM] Ananas#9063
That make all of them hotter, because they are intaking the air that is heated up by the other card's backplate


[10/16/2021 11:02 AM] Dv#3650
Probably, but the tower fan won't be able to cover width of the rack that way


[10/16/2021 11:02 AM] Ananas#9063
Ur right


[10/16/2021 11:02 AM] Dv#3650
It's a pretty directed stream


[10/16/2021 11:03 AM] Ananas#9063
i'd find two box fans and put them on the top level, blowing upwarda


[10/16/2021 11:03 AM] Dv#3650
It's a temporary solution anyway, end game is a grow tent


[10/16/2021 11:03 AM] Ananas#9063
Towards the ceilinf


[10/16/2021 11:04 AM] Dv#3650
Yea that's the issue lol it's in somewhat of a closet haha


[10/16/2021 11:04 AM] Dv#3650

[10/16/2021 11:04 AM] Dv#3650
Just haven't gotten to that point yet


[10/16/2021 11:05 AM] Ananas#9063
Ah I see


[10/16/2021 11:06 AM] Dv#3650
Wired all this up a few weekends back, 3rd circuit is for my attic when my ASIC gets here. But grow tent is going to vent up above through the attic and outside

Got these as open box for $170, normally retail for almost $900, gonna use one of them for the wire rack and the other for the ASIC

@Aquaritek what cards you running?


[10/18/2021 10:25 PM] Aquaritek#9015
I've got 20 1070tis, 4 1080tis, 2 1080's, and 2 3060tis (non-lhr)


[10/19/2021 2:37 AM] Runstyle#5968
just curious, i think ETH would be more profitable for them 10 series cards


[10/19/2021 2:37 AM] Runstyle#5968
mine ETH -> buy ERGO


[10/19/2021 3:21 AM] Aquaritek#9015
It's not that different. Maybe 10 bucks a day.


[10/19/2021 3:22 AM] Aquaritek#9015
Atleast at the moment


[10/19/2021 3:25 AM] Aquaritek#9015
Autolykos2 is the give my cards a break algo when it's not that difficult to mine. When you calculate power costs into the mix AL2 is about 35 to 40% more efficient which in the end nets about 10 bucks or so. Realistically I switched over right before the diff jump yesterday and the difference was only pennies.


[10/19/2021 3:31 AM] Aquaritek#9015
These old cards though will only do about 0.85MH/W or so. I'm just surprised they're still going. I've been mining on these rigs for 3 years. Not a hitch lol. I even ran x16R on these puppies full blast for a year back in the day. That was a "hot" algo lol.


[10/19/2021 1:03 PM] geezar#8187
the 80ti's surprised me on this algo - what hash are you seeing out of interest?


[10/19/2021 3:57 PM] Aquaritek#9015
My 1080tis are running 115MH at 140W I would bet I could lower tthe wattage but 140 is the floor can't lower it further. My 1080s are doing just shy of 80mh at 100w and the 1070tis are doing 72 to 73mh at 90w.


[10/19/2021 4:19 PM] geezar#8187
Yep - I managed to squeeze out 120 MH/s 139w 225/1800/140PL - great performance, I also used to have it on x16r and even ETH when they did 55 MH/s with the pill - good luck with it - 10 series still delivering the goods üëç

@Kiljoy curious - stunning setup but never considered a grow tent?


[10/30/2021 12:48 PM] Kiljoy#3695
Yeah not enough airflow, to combat the heat I have intake and exhausts MUCH bigger than a few 6‚Äô‚Äô holes will allow in a grow tent even with high CFM fans


[10/30/2021 2:29 PM] geezar#8187
Yep for sure you would need twin 720's and 8" at least for your setup


[10/30/2021 2:30 PM] geezar#8187
non active intake I've found OK as long as you have sufficient negative pressure and high CFM that said

Unless you substitute co2 then you want less airflow! Growing my plants takes much less cfm than cooling my rigs

cant wait for eth to move to POS; i want to build a rig as nice as some of the ones i see in here; i'm no good at finding decent GPU prices so i hope some eth miners give up and give me thier rig/GPUs for a discount

Check these out, something to consider for some organization, I wouldn't use these in particular but there's many things like this you can do to organize them, I bet you could find a free file  online for some type of similar mount and have them printed urself cheap/free.

Finally consolidated my two rigs into one. I planned to deposit it in a datacenter but they canceled at the last minute so I just rolled with it. Asrock q270 working beautifully. Using 3x850W. This setup allowed me to keep one of my 6 card rigs empty and ready for deployment whenever I can scoop up cards at a discount and I will be selling the other 6 card rig I gutted for parts. Also saving around 70W when compared to split operation. Still mining ETH and buying ERG off it though. Hope it will be worth it to straight up mine ERG soon. For comparison, the very first post in this channel was my two initial rigs, without the 3080ti üôÇ

You can get V2 up to 107-110 MH/s i've found that -502, 1250 or 1300 and 60% power give you that solid

hey, how much mhs did u get on the p106-100? did u figure what it maxes out at regardless of power considerations? and what overclocks r u running if i may ask


[08/18/2022 9:46 PM] sikkan#6377
I get the same roughly as my 1060s.. 58-59 mhs set to 60w power limit


[08/18/2022 9:46 PM] sikkan#6377
core +100-150 and mem +1200-1300


[08/18/2022 9:56 PM] sikkan#6377
setting power above 60w gives no extra hashpower either..I actually wish I could set it to lower than 60 but its not possible


[08/19/2022 12:32 AM] BrothaChad#0168
mmmm seems like the p106-100 and 1060 are identical, thank you!


[08/19/2022 5:37 AM] sikkan#6377
Yes, when it comes to ergo atleast. The p106-100 is faster in other algos though if power limit is raised :)


[08/20/2022 4:58 AM] BrothaChad#0168
ok üôÇ and do the p106s get hot or are they very manageable


[08/20/2022 11:09 AM] sikkan#6377
Since they come with preinstalled heatsinks only an external fan is required so it would be more dependant on what fan/airflow is given those cards I'd say

[08/20/2022 11:11 AM] sikkan#6377
I run a desk fan directed those cards which works sufficient but tend to get warm when it's 27-30c outdoors. Around 80c

8x rx570 making $0.14 per day profit after power! This rig has mined 260 ERG in 2022 so far. Stacked them coins while I still had the chance edit: whattomine isn't accurate it seems that this rig is actually losing $1.24 per day

How would you rate the a2000 gpus?
Solid for the price? Also how loud are they?

I would rate them 8.5/10 pros small,runs off riser, efficient in most algos. Cons. they run warm & require extra cooling in some instances.

Thanks for the response, I have a A2000 mining rig planned. Got to do some more research though.

highly recommend, just make sure to get ready to change some thermal pads


[10/22/2022 1:29 AM] rpnChilled#6140
I can't remember if I used 2mm or 1.5


[10/22/2022 1:30 AM] rpnChilled#6140
But Gelid extreme should do the trick


[10/22/2022 1:30 AM] rpnChilled#6140
I always follow youtube tutorials on this shit anyways


[10/22/2022 7:39 AM] New user#0001
Awesome, thanks for the tip. I have thermal pads in various thicknesses at home so I don't think I need to buy any üëå


[11/05/2022 5:11 PM] rpnChilled#6140
thats good, you're all sorted then

Just got my setup put together at my new house. 8 LianLi server cases heating my garage. There‚Äôs a 16‚Äù ac infinity shutter fan behind them for when it gets too warm

asking here as seems like your the guys who would know


[11/22/2022 3:37 AM] deadmanjack#7418
I'm moving my GPU farms into cabinet's , i've brought some nice storage lockers ,about 400 mm deep ,1500mm wide ,1000mm tall , perfect for putting GPU mining racks in (im building them custom for the box) along side the hardware to run em.
I intend to cut 120mm/140mm/200mm holes on the back plate depending on where i end  place hardware ,and leaving the front storage doors open, and getting a fiber board or albumin sheet for the front and cutting 120mm/140mm/200mm holes into for fans on the front/  air filter panel.

The over engineering is required as these 2 unit's are for the shared rental i live at , so space/noise/easy heat magmeant (dumping it outside via window with ducting).

  is there something I've overlooked in my build 
and
 what options exist for managing  20~30 fans , i would use the break out boards for fan power and spreading's the fans out amongst the psu's  but will be using atx supplies for noise reasons ,i know i can split them out from Molex and sata  but if there is another way ?

guys... how can you mine profitably? Seriously though. I'm already on Solar and what I mine doesn't even cover depreciation


[11/22/2022 1:31 PM] zgraber#6774
Who said anything about mining profitably? I could definitely buy Erg for less than I can mine it for right now, but exchanges can‚Äôt heat my garage. Server cases sure can.

For me it‚Äôs all about acquiring cheap efficient gear right now. I just picked up 8-6600s and 8-6600xts for $2500.


[11/22/2022 1:44 PM] zgraber#6774
How much gear are you cramming into these cabinets? One thing I can think of is you probably want some fresh air getting to your PSUs in the cabinet to keep them cool and quiet. 

What‚Äôs your setup look like now?
