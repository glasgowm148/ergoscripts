"The Chinese character for ‚Äúenemy‚Äù means to be similar to or to answer ‚Äî Don‚Äôt answer the machine ‚Äî Shut if off ‚Äî"
-William S. Burroughs

"Our natural bias is to accept the new gimmick as a thing that can be accommodated in the old ethical order...
[However] It is the art of the interval, rather than the art of the connection, (which is not only medieval but Oriental); above all, it is the art mode of instant electric culture.
-Marshall McLuhan

Hello @networkspore I tried dming but realized you had blocked me üòÜ 

I am assisting Ergo Foundation with the ergohack and they are gathering participants to see if people would be able to create a video presentation on the project each person has created. Ideally would need to have a video back 2 weeks or so following the hackathon. The videos will be shared publicly on the Ergo youtube channel as a way to share what the community has put together during the event! Would you be able/intersted? If not interested that is okay, and wish you best of luck with the rest of the hackathon
