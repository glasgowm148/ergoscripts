he was quite rude when he was here, good thing he is not a founder


[08/04/2021 8:23 PM] geezar#8187
Tried it, payments issued without a problem but still no clarity on an apparent extended period of assumed rejects, they have hit a few more blocks since so will assume that period was 'bad luck' perhaps


[08/04/2021 8:24 PM] geezar#8187

you still seeing blonks @ProSavage  with all this crazy hash coming onto the chain?


[08/06/2021 7:36 PM] geezar#8187
We should create a google sheet and try to automate a feed for blocks found.. few discord apps allow this if the pool is OK with setting up and sending here - guessing most send those alerts to their own pool discord like Enigma - would be a nice feature over here IMO


[08/06/2021 7:37 PM] geezar#8187

Enigma is still really small. Or leaf. 2 miners i think overtook wooly on sizs recently? Those are my suggestions though wooly is great and not sure you will be happier somewhere else.

betting on 3-4PH by next week with that whale that just joined... gone are the days of 4 erg per day...


[08/07/2021 2:52 PM] MrTon#1850
what whale? where?


[08/07/2021 2:52 PM] Ivanoe#5462
check the network hash.... 10TH just got added


[08/07/2021 2:54 PM] Ivanoe#5462
nanopool is also down to 38% from what 56% yesterday?


[08/07/2021 2:55 PM] MrTon#1850
probably people not understanding 1559 effect yet.. but ETH is spiking so we might see some hash go back


[08/07/2021 3:00 PM] Ivanoe#5462
well see, there is gonna be a stabilization period in the redistribution of hashrate on different coin... and i'm already getting a lot of alert for used Gpu for sale, a guy near me was selling 14x 580 4g at 250$ a pop yesterday... thought about it and in the end my current 1gh erg rigs use 800w and 7 of those 580 would use 770w for barely 420 so i said nah...


[08/07/2021 3:21 PM] Nythain#6769
At current nethash and block times i see >3 in about 4 days give or take some hours.


[08/07/2021 5:24 PM] geezar#8187
2 blocks in a single day over on Enigma, could it be the underdog making another play.... great to see the smaller pools see some of the action üëç

It's crazy watching all that hash move from different coins when events like this happen. I thought about switching my rig, but I would of been to late, with the delay from confirmations, and sending to an exchange, I would not of made any extra profit hopping, maybe even less.


[08/08/2021 4:01 PM] MrFreeze#0650
Everyone will come back when network difficulty goes down then before you know it will go back up lol

[08/08/2021 8:32 PM] geezar#8187
Nice @CryptoMinerOS I did not know this. All the more reason with these bonus structures + zero fees why there is not more hash pouring in from the big guys.

The 500+% block makes sense but without any idea how many were rejected nor any way to determine from the UI pretty much in the dark.. since moved to a different pool..


[08/09/2021 7:10 PM] geezar#8187
With the human malware and all... hope the guy is OK tbh

I am thinking about jumping ship too.. where did you move to @geezar ?


[08/09/2021 8:18 PM] geezar#8187
The lack of details and ways to know about rejects made me leave - we did finally see a 500% block but who knows what happend pre/after - with no details or input from the pool op hard to call... me - testing 24/48 hours on the smaller pools - TBH Leaf and Enigma with 0% fees and the bonus being offered is too hard to resist üôÇ


[08/09/2021 8:20 PM] geezar#8187

[08/09/2021 8:21 PM] geezar#8187
Can't see the honeymoon period of bonus + zero fees lasting (not sustainable for the ops) but for the moment its win-win


[08/09/2021 8:24 PM] Nythain#6769
Well enigma might be able to sustain 0 fees for a while. Pro mines in the pool too and hes a student with fewer financial responsibilities lol

@virtualprospector22 yeah that whale and a uptrend in network mh triggered 2 raise in difficulty, now the 2 min block objective is around 140-150 second...so not sure if it's gonna take into account the peak of a few days ago and go up, or if the current time delay will push difficulty lower... we'll see...

How does it work having multiple locations? Do you have a node and instance of pool on each server? Connecting to the same DB? TBH I don't plan to do it, but curious the method.


[08/12/2021 12:46 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I'd maybe add servers in Scotland, Ireland, and Wales.


[08/12/2021 12:46 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Still UK, but one in each section.


[08/12/2021 12:47 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I wonder if the efficacy is noticeable.


[08/12/2021 12:47 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Probably not...

[08/12/2021 12:48 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
After using a p2pool instance, latency and people not connecting from 10 million miles away is high in my mind.


[08/12/2021 12:50 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I've seen rejected shares get up to 30% on p2pool network.


[08/12/2021 12:50 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
10% is common, people tell me it doesn't matter, that's just how it works. But my wallet tells me a different story.


[08/12/2021 12:51 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
We put so much effort into making our node efficient, and got our rejects very low, but it still felt like we were being punished for other nodes and poor setups on the network.


[08/12/2021 12:52 AM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
This is better.

looking good @ASCiiDiTY  - are you planning on including rejects on the UI?


[08/12/2021 10:54 AM] geezar#8187
An example of one of the pools that does not contain this (there is no way to determine how many when mining, other pools include this so a good feature)

What is getting rejected on those pools? Blocks!?


[08/13/2021 7:00 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
It will already show if a block is orphaned etc.. the reason you can't see it is because it hasn't happened. Or do you mean something else? Rejected shares??

BTW I only have VTC on my pool, I'm waiting for ERG to be implemented into miningcore as I have no idea how to do it. It looks to me that some of these pools are having technical issues? Or am I completely missing something?

I joined forces with another pool owner, so we are pooling our skills together, and basically have clones of each others sites, but in different locations, with obviously customised branding.

[08/15/2021 7:14 PM] geezar#8187
Still waiting for a pool op to come back on the Rejected blocks - regardless of how they were created there was no way to determine they 'had' actually happened - in this instance many days of mining passed with no idea if we were just unlucky or not - this is also true of the luck percentage, when a block was found (500%) this did not relay how many 'rejects' came before it


[08/16/2021 12:11 AM] ProSavage#7131
I‚Äôve never had daemon reject blocks.

@ppf so as not to activate the PPLNS what is the minimum hashrate I need to have, I'm trying to find some OC setting to use when Im gaming that won't affect, as the OC I have atm is locking voltage and clock for stability


[09/10/2021 1:13 PM] ppf#7249
there is no *minimum* hashrate you need to have, regarding OC I strongly recommend our discord https://discord.io/ethermine (or ofc the mining channel on this discord)


[09/10/2021 1:13 PM] ppf#7249
the difficulty of our shares is currently 4Gh


[09/10/2021 1:13 PM] Fir3#0726
I'll ask for help there


[09/10/2021 1:14 PM] ppf#7249
so with 4GH/s you will find a share every second


[09/10/2021 1:14 PM] ppf#7249
but it does not matter really, if you find a share every hour you will still get your reward


[09/10/2021 1:14 PM] Fir3#0726
I'm doing 220mhs ATM


[09/10/2021 1:14 PM] Fir3#0726
Oh, so I just need 1 share hour?


[09/10/2021 1:14 PM] ppf#7249
we count every share


[09/10/2021 1:14 PM] ppf#7249
no matter how often you send it


[09/10/2021 1:15 PM] ppf#7249
if you send 1 share per hour you will get a reward for it


[09/10/2021 1:15 PM] Fir3#0726
So the crap rewards for last night was just he luck gods?


[09/10/2021 1:15 PM] ppf#7249
yeah üò¶


[09/10/2021 1:16 PM] ppf#7249
we need more hashrate to have reliable constant rewards


[09/10/2021 1:16 PM] ppf#7249
but in the end it does not matter, you will get pretty much the same reward for your hashrate on every pool


[09/10/2021 1:16 PM] ppf#7249
pools with higher hashrate will pay out more frequently


[09/10/2021 1:17 PM] Fir3#0726
Ok, I'll check your discord so someone can help me on an OC setting that I can mine slowly and game at the same time


[09/10/2021 1:17 PM] ppf#7249
most important for everyone is good distribution of hashrate over all the pools, it will benefit the project and thus benefit us all

New pool coming soon, https://bbqdroid.org . Been hosting a vertcoin pool for a while, now it's time to roll out ergo. 0% fee until 2022, then a small 1%. If anyone is interested in helping finding our first test block, let me know. We'll push an official release as soon as the first block is found and paid out fine. üôÇ
