about ageusd


[02/14/2021 3:13 AM] Pats#7415
i read an articled but i still dont get the difference with Dai for example


[02/14/2021 2:57 PM] c8e4d2a#9854
difference to dai is that u don't get liquidated on  a price spike


[02/14/2021 2:58 PM] glasgowm#9381
```Unlike Ethereum-based crypto-backed stablecoins, such as DAI, Emurgo introduces a Staticoin protocol-inspired design that does not rely on CDPs (Collateralized Debt Positions). The reason for this is the vulnerability of CDP-based protocols in terms of high volatility and blockchain congestion.As Emurgo states, ‚ÄúBlack Thursday,‚Äù when MakerDAO CDPs were triggered for liquidation due to volatility and then sold for $0 due to blockchain congestion that prevented others from bidding, demonstrated that a new design is needed. For AgeUSD, this scenario is not possible.```

**Mining Incentives of AgeUSD on a PoW Chain**

AgeUSD offers a unique way for miners in a POW system to create the base infrastructure for a robust DEFI system.

Welcome to AgeUSD, a 400% asset backed, Decentralized, Algorithmic Central Bank. This is protocol is the foundation on which a new era of digital finance will be built.

Miners that maintain the network are the lifeblood of a robust POW system. A decentralized system will have a variety of actors that allow the system to grow. It is important to consider the proper incentives to serve the needs of the community. Ergo is built on solid technological foundations, the decentralized financial market is built with historical foundations in mind.

Traditionally central banks held gold as reserves that backed currency. Currency was used as a stable medium of exchange throughout economies. When stable or backed by assets this system of banking allowed commerce and growth.

We have moved away from a system in which currency is backed by anything. The global reserve currency is run on a banking system that has 0% reserve requirements. Governments around the world are in the process of continually feeding liquidity into the global economy. Central banks globally are creating money and debt at unprecedented rates. This debt will either burden countless future generations or debts will reach a point of default and restructuring.


[02/16/2021 4:13 PM] glasgowm#9381
Digital Assets are a market alternative to the inflationary pressure of fiat currency. The "law" enshrined in code creates scarcity, at a predictable emission schedule. The resource in Ergo is ERG. Miners consume electricity and create this secure electronic asset.

In the global economy gold is produced by miners and is sold to a variety of actors. Some gold miners may sell ore/refined product to open markets, create OTC contracts, or sell to central bank to hold in reserve.

Ergo already has pathways to the open market via exchanges. OTC, dark pools, and a DEX are in development for private P2P sales.

AgeUSD represents a 3rd option that allows miners access to liquidity, the ability to interact with a central contract, or bank while circumventing the open market.

The economics of mining crypto is similar to the economics of trading. Some miners build long positions. They are project oriented. They to find a project they believe in and provide critical network infrastructure, maintenance, and development.

Other miners act as freelancers, they provide critical services to projects that are profitable. They often do not build reserves and are continually liquidating in the open market to cover their cost of production.


[02/16/2021 4:13 PM] glasgowm#9381
**SigmaRSV** can offer project oriented miners a way to maximize their positions by accumulating fees. This class of miners can naturally benefit from SigmaRSV.

**SigmaUSD** can offer liquidity to freelance miners to cover their expenses in a decentralized manner, free of exchanges.This class of miners can naturally benefit from SigmaUSD.

**AgeUSD** offers a somewhat hidden incentive for miners to create greater price stability in the asset they are assisting to create and maintain. Over time this builds to the robustness and resiliency of the network.

PoW benefits from price stability. The core infrastructure providers (miners) operate on a Return on Energy Invested model. The base cost of this mode is Equipment and Energy.

Price stability assist miners in predicting future costs/revenues. AgeUSD can serve as a mechanism of price stabilization as miners interact with the contract based on their incentive. Long vs Liquidity.

Interacting with this protocol rather than interacting with the open market is beneficial to all parties.

The premise of ERGO has always been a PoW system that can operate as a Digital Reserve of Programmable Gold.

what's the reason to go from 800% to 400% ?

not cool

Good writeup for miners. When can we start? üôÇ


[02/16/2021 5:49 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
Only thing I dont understand is why the p/b would remain 10% if erg was withdrawn from the reserve


[02/16/2021 5:50 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
I mean it would be a larger portion of p/b if there was less b

Not entirely following - you're talking about the Alice/sigUSD example right?


[02/16/2021 5:59 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
yes it says 10% in both examples and that seems very oddd


[02/16/2021 5:59 PM] glasgowm#9381
I assumed them to be independent from each other if that's what you mean


[02/16/2021 6:01 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
2nd example where it says that on use reserve only holds 90 erg


[02/16/2021 6:01 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
if reserve is less then your price to book ratio goes down it does not stay the same. Atleast thats how it works in stocks


[02/16/2021 6:02 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
only way erg would go down is someone had used reserve coins to withdraw it


[02/16/2021 6:02 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
so that means less reserve coins overall as well.. so any way I think about it for it to remain 10% is wrong?


[02/16/2021 6:03 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
Or am I somehow thinking wrong on that?


[02/16/2021 6:05 PM] glasgowm#9381
Ah right okay I'm following now sorry. Not sure, example may be simplified slightly (it was added by Anon.Nautilus)


[02/16/2021 6:07 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
Ok yeah that could be it to show with same % the drop in value to simplify things.


[02/16/2021 6:24 PM] Claydo#3635
Do 100% of the fees go to reserve token holders, or does some portion go to a treasury or anywhere else? Thanks for the in-depth write up!


[02/16/2021 6:27 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
good question. usage works in favor of going long if all fees go to token holders. Basically time works in your favor then.

[02/16/2021 6:29 PM] c8e4d2a#9854
can i find the SigmaUSD ui code somewhere?


[02/16/2021 6:29 PM] Armeanio#0321
It is my understanding anyway that fees go into the reserve (treasury)  Reservecoin holders have a call on a price/book amount of this total (-fees)

I do not think fees are paid like a dividend to reservecoin holders. 

I do think the host gets a small fee for hosting, and maintaining AgeUSD contract. The mixer has a small fee as well.


[02/16/2021 6:50 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
"SigmaRSV can offer project oriented miners a way to maximize their positions by accumulating fees. This class of miners can naturally benefit from SigmaRSV."


[02/16/2021 6:50 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
what does fees here reflect?


[02/16/2021 6:53 PM] Armeanio#0321
I imagine fees accumulate in the reserve (treasury) which SigmaRSV holders have a call on.


[02/16/2021 6:53 PM] Armeanio#0321
Indirect not direct


[02/16/2021 6:53 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
right so with treasury you are not talking about ergo treasury but the reserve coin treasury?


[02/16/2021 6:54 PM] Armeanio#0321
Yeah a reserve in the contract. Fees are paid in ERG


[02/16/2021 6:55 PM] Armeanio#0321
Ageusd reserve treasury perhaps we can call it.


[02/16/2021 6:55 PM] Armeanio#0321
Totally Separate from the erg treasury that goes to the ergo foundation.


[02/16/2021 6:56 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
Yes I follow you now. I hope thats the correct understanding as that would be pretty cool üôÇ


[02/16/2021 6:58 PM] Armeanio#0321
The erg treasury is funded by miners as they mine. 

The ageusd treasury holds the ergs people use to create SigmaUSD or SigmaRSV plus it accumulates ERG fees.


[02/16/2021 6:59 PM] glasgowm#9381
Fees go to reserve-holders I believe


[02/16/2021 7:00 PM] Claydo#3635
And as that ageusd treasury gets bigger, it raises the P/B ratio, allowing SigmaRSV holders to call at a higher value?


[02/16/2021 7:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
oh sorry they go to the reserves, not reserve holders

[02/16/2021 7:01 PM] Armeanio#0321
Yea there is no dividend, just a call on the reserve.


[02/16/2021 7:01 PM] Claydo#3635
So it's kinda like tilting the table over time towards higher P/B ratio


[02/16/2021 7:01 PM] Claydo#3635
even if ERG stays at 2$ forever, the ratio is still going to get better because fees will accumulate into the reserve


[02/16/2021 7:01 PM] Armeanio#0321
It depends on use. The greater the use the more fees accumulate.


[02/16/2021 7:02 PM] Claydo#3635
Cool, I think I'm starting to wrap my head around it.. thanks for simplifying things! üôÇ


[02/16/2021 7:02 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
Well guys I think we are about to make history today .. I know I am joining AgeUSD as reserve coin holder thats for sure. As long as contract doesnt go wild somehow I think this is a solid proposition if you have a long term view on ergo.


[02/16/2021 7:03 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
but we are taking the risk of dealing with an autonomous contract that if has any bugs could screw us over. That is the major risk as far as I can see it.


[02/16/2021 7:10 PM] Claydo#3635
I have another question, when you can mint SigRSV and SigUSD with ADA, will their ADA get converted into ERGs to be held in the treasury? Curious for the effect it might have on the future price of ERG


[02/16/2021 7:11 PM] Claydo#3635
(Held in the AgeUSD treasury)


[02/16/2021 7:13 PM] Claydo#3635
My guess would be minting either coin with ADA would convert the value into ERGs


[02/16/2021 7:26 PM] Armeanio#0321
No they will run on separate chains.

Erg version and cardano will have a plutus version I believe. Maybe they can interact in some future date through a DeX perhaps idk.


[02/16/2021 7:28 PM] Claydo#3635
I guess one thing I don't understand is how once AgeUSD is operating on Cardano with ADA, how that will benefit Ergo and ERG holders?


[02/16/2021 7:30 PM] Claydo#3635
Thanks again for taking the time to answer all these questions!


[02/16/2021 7:32 PM] Claydo#3635
I believe in what Ergo is building, but I have a hard time finding good explanations of the tokenomic side of things


[02/16/2021 7:33 PM] Claydo#3635
I'm sure it's obvious to the developers and I'm just trying to get a glimpse :)


[02/16/2021 7:35 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
It wont benefit ergo I think..only if they in future allowed exchange between the two ageusd deployments


[02/16/2021 7:53 PM] Claydo#3635
Talking out of my butt now, but if ERG is a native token on Cardano, would it be possible to convert ADA and fees into ERG on the Cardano chain? Assuming ERG will be on Ergo and Cardano's chains


[02/16/2021 9:15 PM] abchris#8522
Do we know what the minimum reserve ratio will be? 200% as in the github docs?


[02/16/2021 9:24 PM] Claydo#3635
Sounds like the current plan is 400% minimum, 800% maximum


[02/16/2021 9:24 PM] Claydo#3635

Some small tweak suggestions

- Change title `AgeUsd` -> `SigmaUSD` ? 
- Swap colours for mining/pending
- Balance circle-graph doesn't look great when at 100% Maybe a pie graph instead?
- Punchier intro, maybe something like below (think its from one of the git documents iirc?)
- may be some contrast issues with purple/black
- should we use the Œ£ symbol somewhere?

```The economic model of AgeUSD was designed by IOHK, Ergo, and Emurgo. Its economic model maintains the conservative settings for collateral reserves and avoids the need for liquidations. Along with that, it supports a fully decentralized stablecoin emission setup. Thus, AgeUSD offers the world a stable, simple, and decentralized stablecoin.```

@glasgowm color is not based on mining/pending. It is based on whether operation succeeded/failed.

@glasgowm color is not determined by pending or mining. If it is green, then the operation has been successful. It may be in mempool though, so it is pending until being mined.

> Does that absolutely need to be manual for security reasons? 'cause its a nightmare üò¢
@glasgowm what? You don't need to set api key in panel at all. Your node's wallet just has to be unlocked which is a one time operation after node is up.


[02/18/2021 7:26 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeh I done that, I was just going back to check - you need the API key to see the wallet


[02/18/2021 7:26 PM] anon_real#2768
Can add unlocking process to the assembler code though

[02/25/2021 10:58 PM] Robert K#0722
With Ergo being in the UTXO model and all of the dApp design patterns being quite young, we have limitations for the throughput.


[02/25/2021 10:59 PM] Robert K#0722
We have a lot of high level design ideas to address this for the future, with asynchronous EUTXO protocols, but this is something that is still being deeply researched.

As such we decided that it was better for the community to have something in the near term rather than waiting another year for the research to solidify into an implementation.

It listed 200 sigrsv up top after I successfully minted about 200 erg worth (200k rsv). But ever since the failed transaction it fails to display the correct numbers. I'll wait for tomorrow to see if it works better. Just feel a desire to say that It's a bit discouraging to experience. Seems it would have been easy to inform the community of the limitations for transactions per minute or that it would be best to use it as a somewhat expirimental run first. Almost an hour now and still shows incorrectly. I appreciate all the work, I want to see it all functioning well also.

[02/26/2021 10:25 PM] Marty#5304
Hi all, I thought I'd gotten my head around the ageUSD protocol earlier but it seems my understanding is still lacking somewhat...

I minted some sigRSV earlier today when ERG was at $3.02. I was curious how much ERG I'd get back if I redeemed my sigRSV now given that the price has gone up a fair amount today. I'm not actually going to do this, just was curious how the price rise had impacted my potential ERG redemption.

When entering my total SigRSV balance in the sigRsv->ERG calculator on sigmausd.io the amount of ERG it tells me I will get back (before fees) is about 30 ERG less than the amount I deposited. As far as I understood I should be able to redeem more ERG than I initially deposited since the price has risen since. 

Is this something to do with the reserve ratio? Can someone help me understand in what scenario I'd be able to redeem my sigRSV for a profit? 

Thanks for all the hard work that's being put in to this, I'm not concerned, just attempting to better understand how it all works üôÇ

[02/26/2021 11:39 PM] Blam25#5185
Not a dev, but to my understanding, the reason that you have not seen any gains from holding sigRSV and instead are loosing erg if u decide to mint back to erg now, is because the gains that were had today was with basically 0 sigmacoin minted, that means that the erg in the sigmausd contracts did not appreciate that much in price, since there was too few. Since that is the source of extra gains, over regular erg when holding sigRSV, there was noone. That means that the fee alone at 2*1.25% probably will make you end up in the negative. This might not be the whole picture though anyone feel free to correct me

sigUSD*


[02/27/2021 12:04 AM] Blam25#5185
There is also the possibility of using sigUSD to short the reserve, which would lower the value of sigRSV, although very risky i presume, and you still have to pay the fee multiple times, so doesn't seem too smart


[02/27/2021 12:17 AM] Claydo#3635
That seems the most likely.. the whole point of capping the reserves at 800% is so that RSV holders value doesn't get too diluted. Right now it's way over that 800% value so any gains are going to be diluted to the point of being less than any fees charged to buy it.


[02/27/2021 12:17 AM] Claydo#3635
So reserve holders aren't going to see any returns until there are people who are actually minting and using SigmaUSD


[02/27/2021 12:33 AM] Claydo#3635
I'm curious, where you guys see demand for SigmaUSD coming from?


[02/27/2021 12:34 AM] Claydo#3635
Just trying to manage my expectations as a RSV holder üôÇ


[02/27/2021 4:14 AM] Marty#5304
Thanks guys, I was aware that when the reserve ratio is considerably over 800% the profits would be minimal / non-existent since the reserve pool is too diluted. 

What has me confused is that the reserve ratio is (at the time of writing) showing as 464% on sigmausd.io and yet there is still no redeemable profit on my minted tokens. 

I have a feeling that maybe things are working slightly differently during the bootstrap period. I'd love to get better clarity on this though and would be very grateful if any devs were able to chime in. 

As far as demand for sigUSD I think there will be lots of demand for this as the protocol becomes more trusted as there isn't really a solid option for an algorithmic stable coin right now. As with all stablecoin, it is a mechanism for escaping volatility. in my opinion and an algorithmic stable coin is far better than something backed by a non crypto asset because in those cases you have to trust the issuer that they genuinely hold the supporting asset.


[02/27/2021 7:15 AM] Marty#5304
Just realised what I was missing... The sigmausd.io website is currently saying the reserve ratio is 476%. It's actually more like 47600%

if you were to consider SigmaRSV to be a long call option on ERG... then i'd equate the fee to the 'premium' to hold that position


[02/27/2021 6:18 PM] Claydo#3635
and 1% isn't too bad considering you can leave your ergs in for as long as you want

[02/27/2021 6:27 PM] oroalej#3957
What advantage do people that mint SigmaUSD get? because currently the fees for converting ERG to SigmaUSD is HUUUGE ( well, it depends on how much you want to convert ).


[02/27/2021 6:29 PM] oroalej#3957
Does SigmaUSD will be used in cardano? or do cardano will create their own ageUSD based protocol stable coin that is backed by ADA?


[02/27/2021 6:32 PM] MetaStakePool#0120
sigmausd is a stablecoin; so if you were 'short' ergo, you mint sigamusd to hop into a stable representation of the usd.


[02/27/2021 7:26 PM] Claydo#3635
It seems to me like Cardano will have their own stablecoin based on the AgeUSD protocol. From what I understand, I don't think this directly benefits ERG holders @oroalej

Hi!

I swapped some SigRSV. How exactly is this working now? Where comes the redeems from? How much? And what is the difference between sigUSD and sigRSV ?

Cuz on website there is only `Provide liquidity and earn premiums upon redemption` as info. ^^


[02/28/2021 12:57 AM] MrSupercool#7391
So the AGEUSD protocol is a headless Dapp which is a novel feature of Ergo. So I don't think that there will be an AdaUSD. But I could be wrong.


[02/28/2021 2:18 AM] JamesKelley#2466
There an ADA-USD oracle pool running and Cardano will support multi-assets at the next epoch boundary, so I'm guessing there will be some sort of cross-chain smart contract to put the sigUSD stablecoin on the Cardano network as well.


[02/28/2021 2:23 AM] JamesKelley#2466
Do I have this right?
1) I buy sigRSV with 100 ERG.
2) Dollar value of ERG doubles.
3) I Redeem the sigRSV for 200 ERG.
Is that correct? So, if ERG was $1 when I bought 100 ERG worth of sigRSV, then I'd have 200 ERG worth $2 after redeeming if ERG is $2, for a total value of $400?


[02/28/2021 2:32 AM] JamesKelley#2466
Further expanding: If I bought sigRSV with 100 ERG worth $1 each, and redeemed when ERG is worth $10, I would redeem 1,000 ERG worth $10 for a total value of $10k. Is that correct?


[02/28/2021 2:35 AM] MrSupercool#7391
I think there are more variables than that.  Like the reserve ratio what not. So it won't likely be exactly that much.  But it's the general idea.


[02/28/2021 2:48 AM] JamesKelley#2466
Cool, as long as I have it generally correct I can refine my understanding. I get that 1% goes into the reserve but I'm not sure how that affects the redemption price. Also, I'm assuming holding the sigRSV does not provide any utility to me as a holder, it is only something that I can redeem later - or is there some potential novel use for the reserve tokens?


[02/28/2021 2:52 AM] MrSupercool#7391
You are adding liquidity to the stable coin. Stable coins can only be minted if there is enough reserves to back them. So right now the reserve ratio is like 2600% and 800%-400% is the ideal ratio. 
So we need people to use the stable coin. Their 1% fee is what pays the sigRSV redemption rewards.

@JamesKelley 
> FAQ : If Erg goes 10x, can I get 10x more erg?
> If people are minting and redeeming stablecoins a lot in future, the 1% fee can add up quickly. Your return ratio depends on a multitued of factors such as when you entered, when you exit, the oracle price fluctuations, the initial reserves, the total amount of SigmaUSD in the reverse.
> 
> If you assume a static amount of ergs in the protocol, then the max would be however many Ergs are provided by the stablecoin owners and you hold all the reserve coins, and the erg price goes to infinity. There is no theoretical max technically

[02/28/2021 6:17 AM] JamesKelley#2466
At this exact moment in time, the reserves are 373% and it won't permit any redemptions. That's because there isn't enough 1% fees going in, or is it because the reserve ratio is too low? You indicated 400%-800% is ideal, so 373% would be below that amount. I thought I got a message saying it couldn't be redeemed at a higher level once, so that is why I'm asking if the redemptions are based on the fees or not. I'm sure I should be reading a white paper or something. üôÇ


[02/28/2021 6:25 AM] JamesKelley#2466
Ahhh.. I just found this. I didn't realize I was buy a percentage of the reserve, at least that is how I'm understanding it now.

Hello guys 
I just wanted to share my expirience with sigmaUSD.
This protocol is a zero sum game. Eigther Œ£USD or Œ£RSV holders win ERG. Ant it seems to me Œ£USD holder winning big currently. I also noticed that a big Whale ist using Œ£USD to speculate in the Markets. He's draining supply to 400% and after that "he" raises supply back to ~2000. This opens door to possible market manipulation. Well if he's good in trading good for him. The Œ£USD market is ~3mioUSD the Crypto-Market is a lot lower. This leads to possible manupulation of the Crypto-Market-Price.

A possibilty is that we limit the sigmaUSD market to a % of the https://www.coingecko.com/de/munze/ergo#markets this would made it lesser manipulative. Im just concerned that it could be the case now. Please think about it and if you think this makes sense discuss with your fellow crypto holder.
Yes maybe im just and alarmist in the next price breakout the Œ£USD get burned.

Liability in ERG = SigUSD circulating supply / ERG Price in USD


[03/01/2021 12:43 PM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
Equity + Liability = Total balance sheet


[03/01/2021 12:43 PM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
That's for the liability side of the balance sheet.


[03/01/2021 12:45 PM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
For the asset side of the balance sheet you can use the Reserve Ratio to deduct how the origin or ERGs is splitted between SC users and SigRSV holders.

There are some popular misconception about SigmaUSD bank already, e.g. that you will get more ERG if the price is going up.  Actually, bank reserves could become more dry when SHORT or LONG traders are fixing profit before you‚Äôre out, then you can get less ERG.

Just read the blog post on front-running & freezing the Erg/USD so that we can redeem tokens fairly.  My question is can I hold on to my SigRSV and just wait until the new dApp is launched, or do I need to redeem these then mint more when the new version is out?


[03/05/2021 3:53 AM] engchitchat#4843
I have the same query. From reading the blog post, it seems like we don't need to redeem them, but there seems to be a lot of confusion. I'm looking at a fairly big loss if I have to redeem now.


[03/05/2021 3:56 AM] Chrome#9840
Just saw a twitter response from Ergo, "Please redeem for $ERG as soon as you can, the last price datapoint will stay at $3.16143 - but the contract address will be different when the next revision is bootstrapped"


[03/05/2021 3:57 AM] Chrome#9840
Locking in the price point is fair, but its unfortunate we have to pay fees to withdraw for ERG then pay even higher fees in we wanted to get back in when the new version launches

There are more ERGs in the reserve than needed to back issuing SigmaUSDs. Normally, the minimum would be 4 ERGs for every 1 ERG used to buy SigUSD, or 400%. Since people have been redeeming their SigUSDs there are not that many issues versus the number of ERGs in the reserve.

Someone knows when SigRSV and SigUSD will be viewable on Yoroi when using ERG ?


[03/06/2021 8:37 AM] JamesKelley#2466
They're redoing the smart-contracts and tokens right now. Do you currently hold and SigRSV or SigUSD?


[03/06/2021 8:38 AM] KushGene#1429
Yes I got some SigRSV cuz I want to hodl for a longer time.


[03/06/2021 8:38 AM] KushGene#1429
ALso mining some ERG with my RX480 xD


[03/06/2021 8:39 AM] JamesKelley#2466
That was a smart move but this was the bootstrap phase and they discovered an issue, so it's being rebooted. You can redeem you tokens and buy back in when it is rebooted. Here is an article explaining everything.

I do like this coin, ERG. I do appreciate with all the hard work done and doing by the dev team, and all involved.  Honestly thanks. But on the other side, I am now really disappointed. Despite my wish, I had to redeem, and shockingly 52 ERG were lost overall, just buying and redemption!


[03/07/2021 12:16 PM] Storm#5224
Not complaining, it's just sadly fine. We've to move on.


[03/07/2021 1:27 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
Im losing 900 ERG if I sell my sigRSV so I'm really disappointed, definitely going to wait a few weeks to see how sigRSV V2 plays out before i buy back in.

that all mu ERG. lol


[03/07/2021 1:35 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
Ya it's a big enough chunk of mine that it's going to hurt to sell back my sigRSV to ERG! But lesson learnt, I shouldn't have gone in 100% for a brand new product!

"Please note that SigmaUSD incident is quite different from DAO hack etc:

    Contract works as prescribed, and has no problems per se
    Oracle pool worked as prescribed also
    The problem lies in interaction between the pool and the stablecoin contract, and also parameters of the contract.

Thus with new oracle pool, updated fee, and more flexibility we‚Äôre going ahead.

Still, please invest responsibly, consider different strategies (LONG/SHORT), combine trading SigmaUSD bank with trading on CEXes etc."

[03/10/2021 10:22 AM] oroalej#3957
it seems like I can get a lot of ERG when reserve ratio is 400. i think this is unfair because what if i have SRV from the very beginning and let's say 2 years had past and the ratio is only around 400 all throughout that duration, and when the time I withdraw my SRV, the ratio becomes 800. since, I withdraw it at ratio 800 I will get less reward even though I contributed during the ratio is low. I hope what i'm saying make sense ( English is not my native language sorry ).

[03/12/2021 2:20 PM] cymatic#8185
Yes, that's still the v1 contract which is now locked. They are working on v2 of the underlying protocol, but after that somebody will still need to put a front end on top of the v2 of the protocol. I haven't heard any official word on whether or not the creator of the front end for v1 (the sigmausd.io site) will be revamping the site for v2...I have heard unofficial reports that this will be the case but nothing official yet and no date for when the v2 front end will be available for buying SigUSD and SigRSV again.

[03/16/2021 6:24 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
Hi guys. I would like to contribute bank contract node. I was wondering what requirements you guys are looking for ? I can set up on my own hardware but I will not have 100% uptime but more like 99.8% uptime. (I do have backup power and two ISP's but even so you still sometimes have bad luck) - however the hardware can handle throughput quite well (direct fiber to fiber and mellanox connect x4 cards that can handle 100 of millions tcp packets per second)


[03/16/2021 6:24 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
My other option would be to rent a server in a datacenter for even more redundancy but less overall autonomy since it would not be my own hardware / own location.


[03/16/2021 8:09 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
In any case I got a node up and running on one of the server computers and ready to contribute with address and public key if needed.


[03/16/2021 8:38 PM] kushti#0978
@Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP we're looking for bank contract update token holder, no need to be online all the time for that


[03/16/2021 8:39 PM] kushti#0978
But for voting the node is needed, as Yoroi is not supporting some functionality needed in a  voting protocol


[03/16/2021 10:43 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
Ergo address: 9hhPkmA9Gk9xmCxBs3GCz88aARGB1sDEcXW9wzrJhVti4hGaZep

Ergo public key. 03a28c38c3b61eb6a246e7454cb30716089dd9ba144bc32398da2a907865e1cd1c


[03/16/2021 10:47 PM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
To be clear I cannot launch such a contract as that could be against financial regulations where I live but I can be a community representative for voting on its metrics.

[03/19/2021 8:24 AM] anon2020s#6116
how switching off works? by burning update tokens?


[03/19/2021 8:30 AM] glasgowm#9381
why?


[03/19/2021 8:30 AM] glasgowm#9381
I think the real concern is for governments - after a few years of a algorithmic stablecoin that remains...stable. Fiat will look increasingly like a poor investment.


[03/19/2021 8:32 AM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
Yes, but I still can't grasp how it can replace the FIAT system. Imagine you replace all USD by SigmaUSD, how do you keep it stable as no one trades real USD anymore?


[03/19/2021 8:45 AM] glasgowm#9381
Very abstract question, but it doesn't need to be tied to USD. It could just be `1 unit of value` - depending on whatever is valuable


[03/19/2021 12:05 PM] Armeanio#0321
Cashlike properties from stablecoins I don't think will disappear. I think the unit stablecoins are derived from would change. 

I think if the USA ever implemented such a ban there could be other stable derivatives to create, the question would is what would be best.

Currency Baskets would be an interesting derivative to try to put together, that would potentially be possible. No government could claim it to be a direct synthetic version of their currency. 

However baskets would need more complex oracles. 

For currency baskets I think there use to be one in crypto called globcoin. I have no idea of its success or makeup. 

There is always the sdr basket. The percentages are public.  

There is also the concept of a commodity/currency basket. The theory being the commodity portion would increase during inflationary times as the value of currencies drops. Vice versa in deflationary times.

I believe there was a paper out of harvard that laid out the basic framework.


[03/19/2021 12:19 PM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
Another way could be to link to USDT, which is itself a wrapped version of USD?


[03/19/2021 12:21 PM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
In the future we might have some broadening views on what is a proper benchmark of something ¬´¬†stable¬†¬ª, could incorporate inflation measures, real estate indexes, and so on. This will certainly be interesting.


[03/20/2021 9:01 AM] Eysteinh (NBX) | ANP#2862
Hmm it seems by having a public face in a stablecoin you could be at risk from such government actions. Not sure I can afford to take that risk of governance token holding even if I support the stablecoin.  I guess I will just support network with a node and hopefully by working on my project family connect

[03/21/2021 7:12 PM] cymatic#8185
I'm trying to wrap my head around how the bank contract (and smart contracts in general) are deployed in relation to each bank transaction (box). Am I correct in believing that...

(1) there is no single central representation of the bank contract that all bank transactions (boxes) link to

(2) instead, a full copy of the contract is embedded in R1 of every bank transaction (box)

(3) because of this, it was not possible to update the v1 contract and make the changes cascade to all the existing transactions. In other words, because there is no central contract that all the transaction boxes link to, there is nothing central to update

(4) the only way to "update" the v1 contract would have been to visit every transaction and modify the copy of the v1 contract in that box's R1, which is not possible as the contract in an existing box is "locked" against modification

I would appreciate any feedback or corrections to these ideas


[03/21/2021 7:50 PM] scalahub#2618
An address is an encoded version of the script (R1). So when we say a contract is deployed at address X, we mean that the script in the contract encodes to X. There can be many contracts at an address (with R1 same and rest all possibly different). In relation to the bank contract, there can be multiple bank contracts with the same script. To uniquely identify a particular bank contract, there is a token (stored in R3). The token should be a singleton (i.e., was issued in quantity 1.. aka NFT),


[03/21/2021 7:51 PM] scalahub#2618
The bank contract also has logic that enforces the NFT be stored only in box with same script (R1) and rest registers based on the formula in the script

First part is correct, then improvements were made to harden against the type of front-running that occurred, final testing is happening now and v2 is being targeted for "go live" today or tomorrow (assuming that is all still on track)


[03/22/2021 7:05 PM] kranebitt#0334
Ok that sounds good


[03/22/2021 11:19 PM] kushti#0978
@kranebitt the bank contract wasn't shut down, as this is impossible. The oracle pool was shut down (it was possible), so the bank contract is stuck with outdated price

Still seems to be the case


[03/24/2021 6:30 PM] Jasonilicate#5211
i think your having a misunderstanding, kushti is saying it isnt shutdown because it is still operational but frozen (i can still redeem sigrsv), and i think your defining shutdown as not serving its initial function.


[03/24/2021 7:26 PM] kranebitt#0334
Yes I got it. The smart contract is still up and running, but with a locked in oracle pool. But from what I understood that should have been fixed this week. Don‚Äòt care too much about the stablecoin, but Ergo gaining back its value.


[03/24/2021 8:36 PM] glasgowm#9381
A new oracle pool was launched, the old one remains stuck.

Higher risk for higher reward. At least from my understanding. When value of ERG low, 1 ERG = lot of sigRSV. If value of ERG goes up, 1 ERG = less sigRSV

Might want to put a disclaimer on the sigma website that says something like when instructing to send your ERGO, 

"Safely minting reserve tokens currently takes more time than a standard TX.
This Sigma TX will take a several minutes and your wallet will be unable to send funds during that time. 
Please plan accordingly for this transaction or create secondary wallet to avoid being unable to use your wallet as usual."

It's corralated to the value of Ergo, so if it goes up, people get less sigRSV for ERGO, and so if you buy it now, and ergo goes up and gets used more, you can exchange sigRSV for more ergo than you did when it was lower

I read that doc, and still not sure what the benefit is for holding ERG vs sigRSV


[03/29/2021 9:50 PM] aehRBDJ2ykn6#7102
"You take 100 ERG worth $1 each and mint them into either StableCoins or ReserveCoins
If you mint SigmaRSV, and the price goes up 10% ‚Äî you get back 110 ERG when you cash out."


[03/29/2021 9:50 PM] aehRBDJ2ykn6#7102

I see


[03/29/2021 9:51 PM] aehRBDJ2ykn6#7102
so both erg's value has gone up by 10% and I also get 10% extra ERG


[03/29/2021 9:51 PM] aehRBDJ2ykn6#7102
so it is effectively betting on the success of ERG


[03/29/2021 9:51 PM] Foeniculum#3278
Is it basically buying ERG on leverage?

can you link me the article you quoted that explanation from? I remember reading it but I've lost it D:


[03/29/2021 9:52 PM] cymatic#8185
If you hold ERGs or hold SigRSV, you get about equal appreciation in value if the price of Ergo goes up. The reason you'd hold SigRSV over ERGs is if you thought the transaction fees for all the SigUSD buys/sells was going to become significant, because all the Tx fees from the SigUSD buys/sells go into the SigRSV "pool" for all the SigRSV holders to share.


[03/29/2021 9:52 PM] cymatic#8185

[03/29/2021 9:54 PM] glasgowm#9381
It depends on tx fees + profits/losses


[03/29/2021 9:54 PM] glasgowm#9381
In that scenario described you do because the person with sigUSD took a 10erg loss


[03/29/2021 9:54 PM] cymatic#8185
But the amount of ERGs you are qualified to redeem for that fixed amount of SigRSV will go up (or I should say "can go up" if Tx fees accumulate and Ergo price stays the same or rises)

So SigmaRSV is actually giving people a way to invest into the health and power of utility of Ergo, rather than just the investment price... so if the price stays the same but the utility goes up, people who buy RSV will benefit.

Exaaaaactly...you get it! But it's not the utility of Ergo that it is based on, it's the utility of the stablecoin SigUSD. As SigUSD gains real world use cases and buys/sells start to increase, the Tx fees from those buys/sells will start to fill the SigRSV side and your "profits" will take shape

[03/29/2021 10:01 PM] cymatic#8185
Shorting happens when you expect the price to fall, right? So if you expect the price of ERGs to fall, and you're holding ERGs, if you wait 2 weeks and the price falls, and then you sell your ERGs, you just lost 2 weeks of falling value. You just lost money (assuming you bought at the 2 week high). However if you expect the price of ERGs to fall, you convert your ERGs to SigUSD. Now over the next two weeks as the price of ERG falls, your value is locked in at the price from 2 weeks ago. Then you sell and get the value from 2 weeks ago though ERG value is "2 weeks lower" in price.

So, SigmaUSD is used to internally, within ERGO, create a stabilization for the investment price...
Is it tied to the utility of the ERGO token and the price? 
Is it tied to the value of SigmaRSV?

And SigmaRSV is used to internally, within ERGO, create an investment price for the SigmaUSD utilization?... 
Is it also tied to the overall value of the ERGO token? or just SigmaUSD?


[03/29/2021 10:27 PM] cymatic#8185
I see the utility of SigUSD going beyond a stabilization of the ERG investment price, because I can see 1000 use cases for SigUSD out in the larger marketplace that go way beyond what Ergo might achieve in the same amount of time. Stablecoins (like USDT and others) have tremendous utility and SigUSD will hopefully be positioned to compete directly with them, but with an algorithmic collateral system (versus tied to fiat like USDT or other schemes for other stablecoins) and unique features that no others have (like mixability to erase transaction trails)

For those who are new to buying SigRSV, here's how you find your SigRSV in your Yoroi wallet after your purchase transaction is successful

```
Is it tied to the utility of the ERGO token and the price?
```
Yes because it needs to be kept at $1
```
Is it tied to the value of SigmaRSV?
```

SigUSD is balanced by SigRSV
```
And SigmaRSV is used to internally, within ERGO, create an investment price for the SigmaUSD utilization?... 
```
It's used to create a reserve to stabilise the USD

```
Is it also tied to the overall value of the ERGO token? or just SigmaUSD?
```
Just SigUSD - but that's tied to Ergo

For any 'stuck' transactions with SigmaUSD use

https://assm.sigmausd.io/return/your_address_set_in_ui/the_long_address_you_sent_to

Just replace your_address_set_in_ui with his address and the_long_address_you_sent_to with the the long address you sent the funds to. You can find both of these by clicking on the transaction id in Yoroi.

The endpoint returns the refund tx ID and your funds will be returned.

This is due to a small bug in the node due to the frequent oracle refresh which is being investigated tomorrow.

Here in the first few days, best bet is to wait until everyone else is asleep so lower demand. Not sure if the dynamic is the same this time as in v1 but if so it seemed like the rejections were worse when everyone was hammering the network.

the UI fee for SUSD in mixer is ZERO, therefor you only pay for the mixing service.
you can mix ERGs now and buy SUSD/ SRSV later (with zero UI fee, nested buy, and higher miner fee which increases the chance of being minted)
or, you can buy SUSD/SRSV from the sigamusd ui and mix them later.
I'm so amazed to mix the SUSD. Maybe someone can issue an NFT of the first ever mixed stable coin üí∏

New member and a dumb question but is AgeUSD renamed to sigUSD? Anybody have a nice resource/overview? Thanks


[03/31/2021 3:21 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
1.) I think the SigUSD is different enough that you might get different answers but it's the replacement in the ecosystem( ~~right? ~~ WRONG see below)
2.) Definitely scroll up üòÑ


[03/31/2021 4:10 AM] cymatic#8185
Welcome! And your question is not dumb at all...it's one that most of us have had at one point. AgeUSD is the protocol (the "blueprint"), and SigmaUSD and SigmaRSV are the current implementation of that protocol. As a protocol, AgeUSD can be implemented in other places besides the Ergo ecosystem...in fact I believe when Cardano implements their stable coin, they will build it as a separate implementation of the same AgeUSD protocol, and will end up with some other name for their stable coin.

Here is an intro article. Note that in the article they use "AgeUSD" in many places where we would now make a distinction and say "SigmaUSD" (at the time I think the "SigUSD" name hadn't been settled on yet, so they were still referring to both the protocol and the implementation of that protocol by the same name "AgeUSD"):

[03/31/2021 2:40 PM] neverending#1195
I'm curious - when taking a short position wrt ergo, what's the incentive to mint sigusd as opposed to putting it on an cex and then usdt for example? The fees are much lower the cex route. I could imagine eventually sigusd would end up listed separately on an exchange anyway, but who would have incentive to mint them in the first place? Will there be apps/smart contracts exclusively using sigusd, for instance?


[03/31/2021 3:53 PM] glasgowm#9381
Possibly, to start it'll be available in the mixer today, auctionhouse soon, then ErgoSwap. Maybe gravity could implement something with it too but idk

the incentive is essentially

1. Switch back easier
2. Decentralised
3. Short position - so you gain ergs during dips
4. Doesn't devalue the coin and instead takes the coins out of circulation essentially


[03/31/2021 4:33 PM] neverending#1195
Thanks for your thoughts, appreciated. 

I'm not convinced on points 1 and 3 (I reckon 1 is a relatively minor convenience given the cost, and 3 can also be achieved in a way that doesn't cost 2.2% fees each way) but 2 and 4 are interesting to me. For 4, I imagine if you're only partially hedging against a dip, you don't want your remaining ERG to be devalued, so I can see some incentive there. Point 2 I suppose is about the coin's fundamentals - if you want an algorithmic stablecoin without DAI's flaws, and there's not a sufficient quantity of SigUSD available on an exchange (or for too high a price), then it'd be more cost effective to mint than buy.

That said, a hypothetical exchange listing of SigUSD/USD would have to hit a price of 1.044 before minting would be preferable to buying on purely financial terms, and for it to go so high above its peg, I imagine it'd need some significant *unique* use cases that drive up demand


[03/31/2021 4:54 PM] glasgowm#9381
For 3), that assumes there's liquidity to provide it for less than a 2.2% loss - which there often isn't even for small amounts. 

I'm not following your last point sorry - why would you do SigUSD/USD ?


[03/31/2021 4:55 PM] glasgowm#9381
or why does the demand for SigUSD/USD specifically matter


[03/31/2021 5:05 PM] Dergler#0451
SigUSD is mixable?


[03/31/2021 5:10 PM] glasgowm#9381
yes, @anon2020s is pushing updates today I think


[03/31/2021 5:20 PM] neverending#1195
Ok cool, liquidity is another one that didn't occur to me - I'm pretty small-time so have never confronted this issue. üôÇ 

SigUSD/USD doesn't matter, it was a point poorly made, apologies. What I'm really trying to say is that there would have to be a fairly strong use case specific to SigUSD to motivate people to mint/redeem it in the first place instead of using a lower-cost alternative for whatever their purpose is. If/when SigUSD is exchange-listed, then usage would perhaps pick up more as buying/selling would be as cheap for SigUSD as for any other exchange-listed stablecoin, but you need the initial supply there in the first place, and I'm still not sure if the liquidity+devaluation+decentralised aspects are enough to motivate minting at a large scale. (Though I'm more convinced than I was an hour ago)


[03/31/2021 5:26 PM] neverending#1195
I'd also say the liquidity only needs to be sufficient to provide for less than a 4.4% loss, because you pay both ways - you pay 1.022 USD for a SigUSD that is effectively only worth 0.978 USD on redemption


[03/31/2021 6:25 PM] glasgowm#9381
I think you're under-estimating the demand for such thing, that's why a lot of people got into crypto - at the start anyway


[03/31/2021 6:25 PM] glasgowm#9381
DAI is 8.5% for comparison with a worse deal (forced liquidations)


[03/31/2021 7:06 PM] neverending#1195
Quite possibly, maybe just a failure of imagination.


[03/31/2021 10:01 PM] Bonkeykong#2837
Has there been any conversation on how staked assets would be utilized?


[03/31/2021 10:02 PM] Bonkeykong#2837
I'm trying to figure out how one could incentivize someone using a product like SigmaUSD when the ability to stake your assets exist. Is there a way to make a reserve filled with Staked assets?

[04/02/2021 3:13 AM] kidamoianlicci#1768
no this is in the beginning only to stabilize. 

How is ageusd backed right now? with 20 different assets in the basket? you cannot start straight with full algo.


[04/02/2021 3:13 AM] glasgowm#9381
The fed could freeze it tomorrow. Their value also depends on how many USD's stored in that bank account (not transparent to ordinary people), and the inherent problem with USD - that the FED, a central authority prints it, remains still. There are other - in my opinion more honest - crypto-only stablecoins, like Dai (of MakerDAO) or Augmint, which are not freezable by any authority, nor cheatable by bribed auditors. They are backed solely by crypto assets, all transparent.


[04/02/2021 3:14 AM] glasgowm#9381
its backed by the reserve


[04/02/2021 3:14 AM] kidamoianlicci#1768
which coins are in the reserve now?


[04/02/2021 3:14 AM] glasgowm#9381
erg


[04/02/2021 3:15 AM] kidamoianlicci#1768
so just one coin. how is that diversified. just like frax you have to start with one or two central coins and then open up the basket later as I understand

taking the most popular stablecoin in the world usdc to have a robust start is a good thing, later the algo will kick in and widen the basket to all sorts of assets


[04/02/2021 3:15 AM] glasgowm#9381
Because it splits erg into two and bets them against each other


[04/02/2021 3:16 AM] glasgowm#9381
so its always balanced


[04/02/2021 3:18 AM] kidamoianlicci#1768
except that there is almost no liquidity in erg, no market. this is why taking popular backing, usdc, in the beginning is interesting.

So you see just this one difference from Frax? Which coin is taken as the backing? 

Any other differences?

[04/02/2021 3:27 AM] glasgowm#9381
```In  the  short  term,  miners  absorb  Terra  contraction  coststhrough mining powerdilution. During a contraction, the system mints and auctions more mining power to buyback and burn Terra. This contracts the supply of Terra until its price has returned to thepeg, and temporarily results in mining power dilution.```

I'll guess that cince the site looks at just one of your wallet addresses, you might have a balance in more than one address? if that's the case then move all your balances to one address and config the site to look there.

It appears I would have to pay a fee to do this. Guess it really does not matter if they are separate. Funny that it put them at different addresses even though I never changed the address on the SigmaUSD site, maybe when I sent them out from the wallet it used the different address?

all those addresses are linked to your wallet, and your wallet will gather the appropriate amount of input boxes from where ever to get the total that's needed for the transaction.


[04/05/2021 4:03 AM] thatexactmike#4716
after exchanging ERG for SigRSV should I see the SigRSV in my Yoroi wallet?  I can see them fine at Sigmausd.io under my wallet address but nothing in Yoroi.  Is that expected?


[04/05/2021 4:31 AM] Dergler#0451
to see other assets in yoroi, you go to send tab and click the drop down menu where ERG is, have you looked there? I know, annoying but yoroi hasn't been updated since multi-asset era.


[04/05/2021 4:53 AM] thatexactmike#4716
Yep, it's there.  Thanks very much - just a bit of peace of mind.  üôÇ

[04/06/2021 7:11 PM] kidamoianlicci#1768
@glasgowm  and what is your assumption about ageusd, what must happen for it to be capable of handling billions in volume like usdt?

Many people have just to use it? or are there also technical barriers


[04/06/2021 7:50 PM] glasgowm#9381
It's a new technology so there will always be technical barriers. The eUTXO design patterns are being improved to handle a greater throughput.


[04/06/2021 7:53 PM] Dergler#0451
on throughput, any sense on what 1000 new wallets connecting and bidding on the auction house will behave like? (not sure who to ask)


[04/06/2021 7:54 PM] kidamoianlicci#1768
so lets solve this tech issues and throughput. What then, how would it get to usdt like volumes?


[04/06/2021 8:21 PM] glasgowm#9381

[04/06/2021 8:22 PM] glasgowm#9381

[04/06/2021 8:30 PM] kidamoianlicci#1768
What if your mentioned tech problems get solved. What other hurdles would lie ahead to achieve usdt like volumes? How would you get there


[04/06/2021 8:46 PM] glasgowm#9381
SigUSD/USD pairs on exchanges, dApp utilisation, ErgoSwap, etc


[04/07/2021 5:41 PM] kidamoianlicci#1768
@glasgowm  how can a algo stablecoin still work in a total bear market? can it even work in a bear in your view?


[04/07/2021 5:51 PM] glasgowm#9381
Because ageusd is kept balanced so there's always at least 4x more reserves than there is USD.


[04/07/2021 5:52 PM] glasgowm#9381
But that's what caused the big dai liquidations a few years back


[04/08/2021 4:33 PM] kidamoianlicci#1768
what caused it? a low reserve balance?

Can you help me with a link to a guide how to obtain ageusd please? If there is no article that walks through the steps, could you quickly tell me the steps pls


[04/08/2021 4:41 PM] glasgowm#9381
```
Unlike Ethereum-based crypto-backed stablecoins, such as DAI, Emurgo introduces a Staticoin protocol-inspired design that does not rely on CDPs (Collateralized Debt Positions). The reason for this is the vulnerability of CDP-based protocols in terms of high volatility and blockchain congestion.As Emurgo states, ‚ÄúBlack Thursday,‚Äù when MakerDAO CDPs were triggered for liquidation due to volatility and then sold for $0 due to blockchain congestion that prevented others from bidding, demonstrated that a new design is needed. For AgeUSD, this scenario is not possible.
```


[04/08/2021 4:42 PM] glasgowm#9381
You can't buy SigRSV now because the bootstrap period is over and the reserve is above 800%. To buy SigUSD you just go to sigmausd.io, connect your yoroi wallet, and put in a buy order. It'll instruct you where to send your erg and the SigUSD will be returned to your connected wallet


[04/09/2021 5:09 PM] kidamoianlicci#1768
@glasgowm  so how many coins are there in total? ageusd, sigusd, sigrsv = 3?

sigusd is the 1$ pegged one? the other two are for investment?


[04/09/2021 5:15 PM] glasgowm#9381
AgeUSD is the underlying protocol. SigUSD is the stablecoin/short position, SigRSV backs the reserve/long position.

@glasgowm  

So is there still a way to get sigrsv with erg by minting?


[04/11/2021 5:53 AM] JamesKelley#2466
You can right now, the reserve ratio is low because sing SigUSD was minted.


[04/11/2021 5:53 AM] JamesKelley#2466
I just minted some myself.

Using the mixer UI you can mint sig RSV


[04/11/2021 3:52 PM] Melid#1510
Is there any tutorial on how to use the mixer to mint sig rsv?


[04/11/2021 4:39 PM] glasgowm#9381
dont think so


[04/11/2021 4:39 PM] glasgowm#9381
```

In order to buy SigmaUSD/SigmaRSV directly from the mixer, DO NOT SET withdrawal address when creating the mix/covert address and use "Set Later" option. Later, at the moment of buying SigmaUSD/SigmaRSV, set withdraw address and choose "SIG USD" option. Only completed boxes can be used for buying SigmaUSD/SigmaRSV.
```

Seems to be in your wallet going off that - probably a node sync issue.

You can restore in Yoroi if its urgent - or make sure the node is at 100%, might be some debugging tips in #node


[04/12/2021 10:50 AM] killawatt#4708
it's not urgent, just making sure there's nothing to be concerned about. the node says its fully sync'd but i'll  restart to see if that does anything


[04/12/2021 11:01 AM] killawatt#4708
So that 372 was already in my wallet, and was redeeming 300k RSV (318 ERG post fee). I sent that RSV to address given on the sigmaUSD page and the RSV has left the wallet according to my node but I don't have the ERG.


[04/12/2021 11:15 AM] glasgowm#9381
You sure it didn't fail and was returned to whatever wallet you had connected? Not seeing any tx for that amount. There's only been one withdrawal today - 52.02053983 ERG at 02:14:51 12.04.2021


[04/12/2021 11:19 AM] killawatt#4708
There's no history info on the sigmaUSD page and the RSV definitely hasn't been returned to my wallet as I don't have any assets at all currently. Pretty confused looking at that transaction tbh.

So if I get the SigUSD approach right, a reserve ratio hovering just below 400% means that the demand for SigUSD is significantly highere than the available SigRSV would allow. I am curious to see how this will eventually evolve

Hello everyone. I got a question: is SigmaUSD/RSV a fork of AgeUSD, or only a UI implementing AgeUSD? I'm still learning and can't find an answer to this. Thank you so much.


[04/17/2021 12:04 AM] Dergler#0451
sigUSD/sigRSV is an implementation of the ageUSD protocol, built on ERG. ageUSD protocol is base currency agnostic and can be re implemented for any other base currency is anyone wanted to do that.

What happens if the reserve ratio falls below 100% and all sigusd holders attempt to redeem their tokens?


[04/17/2021 9:32 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
The reserve is kept between 400% and 800%, you can't redeem sigRSV below 400% and you can't mint more sigUSD above 800% so this situation can't happen with the stable coin. Thats what seperates us from the rest of the stablecoins.

I see the reserve is at 385% currently, having been steadily decreasing throughout the day. How can this happen? Is it associated to ERG/USD value?


[04/18/2021 6:53 AM] neverending#1195
You can hit 100% if erg's value drops enough from 400%, and you can redeem sigusd below 100%?


[04/18/2021 12:52 PM] neverending#1195
Ok I think I figured it out from https://github.com/Emurgo/age-usd/blob/main/ageusd-specs/v0.3/stablecoin-spec.md , looks like below 100% sigusd loses its peg and can be redeemed for reserve ratio * Sig/USD price. Can anyone confirm or correct that assertion?

Yes, the reserve balances the stablecoin. If the price dips - the the ratio does too

Working on it, seems to be working pretty well though. Bearwhale is down 100k and even with BTC shitting the bed it came nowhere near profitable for him

Is there a push to get sigUSD denominated auctions going in auction house?


[04/18/2021 10:57 PM] kidamoianlicci#1768
exact, look at Terra Luna, algo stablecoin will never function or hold the peg without extensive embracement by third party staking farming lending dapps. Its all about adoption. This is a problem bc you might have great dev/tech but nobody may adopt it. 

the stablecoin has to be inserted into many other services, maximize its usage


[04/19/2021 6:45 AM] OHKevO#7049
Will sigRSV and sigUSD be implemented directly on Cardano or will there be another version of ageUSD implanted on Cardano?


[04/19/2021 7:20 AM] NucaColaüë®üöÄ#3711
I dont think there will be another version for cardano


[04/19/2021 7:20 AM] NucaColaüë®üöÄ#3711
It's on Ergo and will interact with Cardano via cross bridge


[04/19/2021 11:30 AM] kushti#0978
With DApp connector it is possible now


[04/19/2021 1:04 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
There is a seperate version. The reserves are not connected as cardano and ergo are on seperate blockchains. They may be connected in time when the DEX is released but not initially anyway.


[04/19/2021 1:05 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
It is confirmed that initially they will be completely different. Eventually they may interact after the cross chain swaps is released after DEX.


[04/19/2021 1:40 PM] glasgowm#9381
He might be right, CH said he was going to implement them in Plutus after native-tokens but haven't heard anything about it since. Since we have several months of development, everything might be ready at the same time (for when Alonso is released). Just depends what's possible in that time-frame I guess


[04/19/2021 9:12 PM] kranebitt#0334
Thanks for the update. But i was wondering - why would you even chase a whale in a decentralized system - he doesn‚Äòt seem to hurt anybody and brings a lot of volume into SigUSD...


[04/19/2021 9:12 PM] kranebitt#0334
Or am I missing something here?


[04/19/2021 9:18 PM] glasgowm#9381
It's the same person who caused the sigmausd reboot. Greedy bastard and has been gaming the system by DoS-ing, hacking, market manipulation, etc. He's down currently but his large position relative to market-size is problematic.


[04/19/2021 9:21 PM] kranebitt#0334
Oh ok, I didn‚Äòt know about his attacs, only about his frontrunning. What harm could he possibly do within the SigUSD contract? If the rr were at 700 and he‚Äòs drop all SigUSD all that would happen is that ERG price would go up and rr would jump up making it impossible to mint more SigUSD for a while. Right?


[04/19/2021 9:23 PM] glasgowm#9381
He can't do any harm within in, he's doing it outside it. Dumping the price and gaining ergs

AgeUSD StableCoin - Welcome to the Rabbit Hole
A new novel stablecoin $AgeUSD is about to release with Cardano $ADA smart contracts.
Here's a breakdown of what it is and how it works.
AgeUSD is designed by IOG (Input Output Global), Emurgo, and Ergo Foundation

Is it possible to allow for "paired" minting or redeeming of sigrsv+sigusd, both at the same time? Right now if someone wants to mint sigusd for some purpose other than speculation, and the contract is below 400%, they have to mint sigrsv first until the ratio is above 400%, then separately mint sigusd and hope they beat anyone else waiting to mint sigusd. Minting them both in one atomic action would guarantee that the person minting the sigrsv then gets first dibs at minting sigusd down to 400%.

Additionally, if you had such paired minting, could you then allow someone to mint/redeem even when the ratio is below/above the 400/800% limits respectively? If they were restricted to mint/redeem a matched amount of each so that the reserve ratio doesn't change. It'd make it easier to add liquidity, if, for instance, someone made a dapp that was dependent on a highly liquid sigusd.

What would happen to stablecoins (sigmausd etc.) based on AgeUSD protocol when price of reserve token drop significantly for example during upcoming bear market? (For example cardano has dropped from 1.2$ to 0.015$ during previous bear market - same could be true about ERG during upcoming bear market)? ü§î


[04/22/2021 5:16 PM] Vesi Hiisi#2550
If the drop is immediate, then there would not be enough equity in the reserve to cover all liabilities. 

In reality, people would probably start redeeming sigUSD when reserve ratio approaches 100%.


[04/22/2021 5:17 PM] Vesi Hiisi#2550
Fractional reserve systems function with even lower reserve ratio.


[04/22/2021 6:59 PM] nitram147#5106
Yeah, but then ageusd type stablecoin would be usable only during stable periods of market. If you expect reserve asset (ada/erg) to rise, than you want to keep ada/erg. When you expect bear market, you want to stabilise at least part of your crypto so you're gonna sell it for stablecoin (to buy back later cheaper). Unfortunately, AgeUSD type stablecoin couldn't be used for this purpose - everybody would want to sell ada/erg to stablecoin and nobody would want continuosly provide reserve during bear market.


[04/22/2021 7:00 PM] nitram147#5106
Or do I miss something?


[04/22/2021 7:11 PM] NucaColaüë®üöÄ#3711
I do agree with this. But we could see other stablecoins with other protocols in the scene as well, if cardano and ergo grows to be large enough. Also we havnt taken into consideration if other sigcurrencies/ commodities will be available which I guess would diversify liquidation to a certain degree?


[04/22/2021 7:14 PM] Vesi Hiisi#2550
I see this as a valid concern. 

Given enough usage, the protocol may also have stabilizing effect on ERG price. Maybe it wont dip 90% if people know that most of it is tied in defi.


[04/22/2021 7:49 PM] fqv#2223
I would also add that the current circulating supply of SigUSD is 1.4 million dollars, which is relatively low. If the project becomes more popular, then the circulating supply would be much larger, and hence (I think) the inertia for staying within 400-800% range would be higher.


[04/22/2021 9:34 PM] kranebitt#0334
Also, it‚Äòs hard to make price prediction, especially when future prices are concerned


[04/23/2021 1:07 AM] oroalej#3957
What will happen if the market crash and I didn't redeem my RSV?


[04/23/2021 2:23 AM] fqv#2223
It's locked until all while the reserves are below 400%


[04/23/2021 2:24 AM] fqv#2223
On the other hand, if there's a market crash, there's an incentive to buy ERG and transform (at least some of it) to SigRSV and earn a share of the pie. All the above, as long as you trust the market will recover from the crash.


[04/23/2021 2:38 AM] damison#3013

[04/23/2021 5:13 AM] Dergler#0451

[04/24/2021 8:37 PM] Foeniculum#3278
Making Ergo tech intuitive for newbies is crucial imo because most people, even Cardano holders who are interested in Ergo either can't or don't want to spend a considerable amount of time to figure out how most of Ergo dApps work

Even the auction house can be tricky to use, since it warns newbies that they cannot connect their Yoroi wallet yet when they click on the Yoroi tab

But the point is, the easier it is to communicate Ergo tech, the easier it's gonna be for newbies to understand the project, appreciate its progress, and share it üôÇ

The problem that we have had from day 1 is that this protocol is not definable for newcomers in a simple diagram, it's so complex it just takes time and research to get a proper understanding of how it's working, it took me the bones of 2 months to 90% understand it üòÖüòÇ I just think any simplified version will confuse people more. This diagram is great for some scenarios, but the issue is when the ratio is going down due to price or shorters taking profits from the reserves, it's very difficult to explain in a concise way.

[04/25/2021 6:49 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
So is it better with RSV to take profits when you can or can you make around the same amount just hodling your RSV tokens


[04/26/2021 3:34 AM] NucaColaüë®üöÄ#3711
No one had experience with RSV for very long to be able to answer that. The idea is that as long as you think ERG is bullish for the long term holding RSV will have better yield than just plainly hodling ERG.

What if the reserve was shown as a piggybank holding x number of ERG and your percentage of ownership in that piggybank?
+ The piggybank would be completely full if the reserve ratio was 800%.
+ The piggybank would be skinny or sad if the reserve ratio is below 400%.
1) When someone redeems SigRSV they take out their % of ERG (minus the fee that stays behind), so you'll see the number of ERG drop but your % goes up.
2) When someone buys SigRSV, you see the number of ERG go up but your % goes down.
3) When someone buys SigUSD, you see the number of ERG go up and your % stays the same.
4) When someone redeems SigUSD, you see the number of ERG go down and your % stays the same.

[04/26/2021 11:09 AM] JamesKelley#2466
If I had more sense/time I'd implement the UI and for the 0.25% dev fee. I believe that is what the dev fee is for, to encourage others to develop interfaces for minting and redeeming SigRSV/SigUSD while using the same smart contracts. Competing interfaces allow us all to win as adoption of SigmaUSD spreads.


[04/26/2021 11:10 AM] NucaColaüë®üöÄ#3711
But for 0.25% fee it has to offer more than just a UI....


[04/26/2021 11:12 AM] NucaColaüë®üöÄ#3711
You are essentially just building a graphic for aomething that has been built. I wouldnt think its in the best interest for everyone to charge a fee for that simple implementation.


[04/26/2021 11:14 AM] NucaColaüë®üöÄ#3711
Rather if you could contribute into growing the possibilites of ageusd protocol is a better contribution and fees on such development is better and fairer for ergo.


[04/26/2021 11:14 AM] NucaColaüë®üöÄ#3711
I could be oversimplifying things.


[04/26/2021 11:15 AM] JamesKelley#2466
I meant that if I wanted to implement a different UI, like the piggybank idea, or is that what you are saying? Are you saying I shouldn't implement a different UI  (and try to incorporate the idea into the existing) or that I can't implement a different UI for the dev fee?


[04/26/2021 11:16 AM] NucaColaüë®üöÄ#3711
Yes I meant if you are taking the existing framework of sigusd and sigrsv and just placing a piggybank UI that i dont think is fair to charge a fee for the piggybank


[04/26/2021 11:16 AM] Dergler#0451
The UI fee is for exactly this reason. To promote competition to improve the UI. This brings adoption.


[04/26/2021 11:18 AM] NucaColaüë®üöÄ#3711
Hmmm maybe i should dig up numbers before commenting more.


[04/26/2021 11:18 AM] Dergler#0451
Also, I hear UI is not necessary to use the contract. So you don‚Äôt need to pay it if you know how.


[04/26/2021 11:20 AM] JamesKelley#2466
I was looking at the raw transactions, which is what lead me to the piggybank idea in the first place because I finally understood all of the math behind it. The UI is easier for me at the moment, but I could imagine other smart contracts wanting to utilize this contract. Such as one that does a swap of ADA for ERG and then converting it.


[04/26/2021 11:21 AM] NucaColaüë®üöÄ#3711

From my understanding of sigUSD and sigRSV is made to show what is possible with ageUSD protocol. I havnt made up my mind if its good protocol for stablecoins or not. I just think not to waste effort into sigUSD . But develop for other usage within the capabilities of ageUSD with better UI and user friendliness taken into account.

Actually it has been as seen from Cardano NFT. But i believe its a huge advantage that hasnt been tapped or possible with account ledger model but easily done with eUTXO, however I am not seeing it implemented in Liqwid and Cardax, which is a waste i think.... multi asset was a touted and marketed capabilities of eUTXO. Could be that ERGO is a better venue compared to Cardano, with built in chain oracle and ageusd.

Like ergomixer? You can do it if you have the know how but the dapps itself made it intuitive for the less technical ? 

I do see the worth but sigUSD already has a UI itself and I believe little effort is needed to implement James' "Piggybank".


[04/26/2021 11:57 AM] Dergler#0451
It‚Äôs not the effort that goes into a product that sets the value, but what the user is willing to pay. If people like the piggy bank they have the choice between that and a different UI or no UI at all.

[04/26/2021 4:05 PM] bk#4411
Is the intention really to have competing UIs? That seems so easy to take advantage of for bad actors. The user experience already requires a tremendous leap of faith to essentially send ERG to some random address. The effort of someone to clone the sigmausd.io UI, host it at something similar (say sigmausd.net) and then prompt the user to send to an address they control, totally disregarding the "real" underlying smart contract, is so very low.


[04/26/2021 4:23 PM] Dergler#0451

when you type in a number it calculates is each time. to reduce the chance of the calc getting stuck, copy & paste. alternatively, use the mixer and buy it that way. it's more time to do it that way though.

Got a question here... I have some SigUSD I want to move to SigRSV. When I go to redeem SigUSD it tells me to send the amount of SigUSD to an address... how the heck do I send it? Not much to go off of in terms of redeeming it. Want to be sure I understand.


[05/05/2021 5:27 AM] fqv#2223
Once you send it, you'll receive ERG back into your wallet. Then you can use those ERG to buy some SigRSV.


[05/05/2021 5:27 AM] fqv#2223
Regarding sending it, you can simply send it using Yoroi.


[05/05/2021 6:08 AM] JP | KUBE#9291

You may already know this but some people accidently send ERG instead of SigUSD. If you're using Yoroi, make sure to select SigUSD under the "Select asset" dropdown.

You can profit off of corrections, instead of keeping your ERG idle

we're in a bullrun but ERG still went from $3.9 to $2 at one point


[05/09/2021 7:33 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
Also you'll likely be able to use it to purchase things in future, as well as use against other currencies in ergoDex, not sure on that though!

Armeanio, [9 May 2021 at 19:43:27 (9 May 2021 at 19:44:47)]:
For SigmaRSV the sell threshold is locked under 400%

Also make sure you don't redeem as the orcale is updating or the tx will fail.

Right now buying SigmaRSV (+800%) is locked but selling is fine.

I recommend a rotation back into ERG from RSV as the amount is SigmaUSD at the moment is not going to be appreciating much (building treasury) and I imagine the whale will be back in at a higher price as he just lost over 100K ERGs

Just consider and manage your risks. I'm trying to help the community understand how to play with this contract. 

If the whale comes back at a higher entry point, his short has a higher chance of being successful. 

The whales exit and the sudden price rise puts RSV holders in a position of higher risk if there is a correction from a new entry.

Always this will be my advice, I'm not mr pumpyshill. I just try to educate and want everyone to manage risks.

Independently from the whale I tried yesterday getting 10K SigUSD back to ERG. It was the first time I tried getting them back as I'm still evaluating the platform.

The first time (https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/7f1569261813f154e7b524fcdc892b20742c217970ab5220eff8cff29c25d856) it failed and the funds were returned. IDK why. I send 0,01ERG (whis is the minimum in the wallet I can send) plus the 10K and it was returned immediately.

The second time (https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/c559d87121f69f7412f92a3857b7fd1f38ccfaaec17e9a0bc8fc1034b0708486) the transaction did not show up on the SigUSD UI. And the funds are now on the destination address w/o any further movements.

The exchanges were both triggered on the UI and I copied the addresses from it.

Somebody pls could check that?


[05/10/2021 7:24 AM] glasgowm#9381

I don't get you, sorry. The SigRSV are already at the central depot. I'm awaiting the ERG. What worries me, is that the SigUSD Site does not show any signs of the last transaction that is pending for me.

Yoroi will send 0.01 ERG with tokens. I've asked @Dmitry Usov to change the default ERG value in node panel to 0.01 as well.


[05/10/2021 9:07 AM] essaias#5787
the default is 0,01 in the full node. But as I was not aware if I need to send ERG with it at all I set it to 0,00 resulting in an error message. Added the 1 again, ant it became 0,001 ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Looks like that whale dude scored a profit of 103,577.591614 ERG. At least he isn't able to buy into the reserve on the way back up.

- As price spiked, whale jumped off with 170k loss
- As oracle price gets higher, he starts blocking withdrawals by spamming proxy contracts so that he can buy more SigUSD
- Once oracle hit $5, he rebought SigUSD ($2m)
- Started dumping
- Good whale market-bought and drove price up again - Bearwhale jumped off with 17k profits


[05/10/2021 10:42 AM] JamesKelley#2466
How does he spam the proxy contracts? Is this something we can prevent? Is it possible to detect when he is spamming the proxy contract, and if so, spam his ability to buy SigUSD? üòÜ

Obviously, spamming him isn't a great idea, but if I can understand what he is doing there might be a way to create counter measures, such as a blacklist.

Is there a sigusd for dummies explanation anywhere. Trying to understand how you win with rsv if coin goes up and win with usd if coin goes down but haven't been able to wrap my head around it


[05/11/2021 3:25 AM] JamesKelley#2466
SigUSD can be spent on any platform that supports it (that will come). If the price of ERG goes down you can use your SigUSD to buy back more ERG. The percentage of SigRSV you hold entitles you to that amount of whatever ERG is in the reserve. When the price of ERG goes up less ERG is needed to cover the SigUSD, so more of the reserve is available to SigRSV holders.


[05/11/2021 3:25 AM] JamesKelley#2466
Let me know if that makes sense.

I'm just playing. I'm a Cardano stakepool operator, so we're on the same team. If you're wanting to invest, you might want to buy the SigRSV which is on the ReserveCoin tab. If you want the stablecoin you go to the StableCoin tab.

heya, I'm for sure asking something stupid, but can someone give me a simple list of steps that one could take to create another stablecoin on top of sigmausd? Assume I know rust, not that well versed with smart contract stuff. No need to go deep at all, just want to understand some things:
1 - how do you guys get the price of the underlying asset (oracles, I imagine)?
2 - do minting new tokens/burning them require smart contracts, or is it a off-chain thingy?


[05/11/2021 9:50 PM] anon_real#2768
1. There is a ERG/USD oracle running. The SigmaUSD bank uses the data that oracle provides.
2. Issuing tokens/burning is an on-chain operation. For example, for burning, you create a transaction in which there is less tokens in outputs than there is in inputs.


[05/11/2021 9:51 PM] cccc#6002
Perfect, thanks, will take a look at the oracle first, might be able to reuse stuff hopefully


[05/11/2021 9:52 PM] anon_real#2768
There is #oracle-pools channel that you can find some info maybe in.


[05/11/2021 9:53 PM] cccc#6002
I'll be active here and there for sure, sigmausd is right up my alley, and there's a definite lack of stablecoins for other currencies

ntroducing SigmaUSD.io the first UTxO-based stable coin - an instantiation of the AgeUSD protocol. The foundation on which a new era of digital finance will be built.

Its economic model designed in partnership between IOHK, Ergo, and Emurgo maintains the conservative settings for collateral reserves and avoids the need for liquidations. Along with that, it supports a fully decentralised stablecoin emission setup. Thus, SigmaUSD will offer the world a stable, simple, and decentralised stablecoin.

use-cases
- Accepted in cryptocurrencycheckout 
- Mix SigUSD or SigRSV in ErgoMixer, the first non-custodial, non-interactive miner in the cryptocurrency space.

Notes:
- Do not use "send all assets" option in Yoroi! It will send sigUSD and sigRSV in addition to ERG.

[05/14/2021 7:42 AM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
Yes - it's due to the site doing the math in background. You should calculate how much you wish to buy and paste it into the box

The whale can come back in with a massive position and wait for dip, then suck the reserve out like a vampire when it does dip, meaning we all lose profits

I describe a potential improvement in my forum post:

https://www.ergoforum.org/t/sigmausd-dao-bank-is-a-complex-beast/767/14

Shortly, I think the option to mint sigusd and rsv simultaenously so that reserve ratio remains unchanged, would be beneficial when external markets open.

Would this be doable without a new v3 version?

Dear Community,  There has been discussions about the contract locking mechanism, and wheter it could be improved. Here is my review of the proposals that I have come across so far.  The current use of the sigmaUSD v1 and v2 contracts have been useful for ironing out bugs, and understanding the dynamics of the protocol. I will focus on the next ...

So, let's just say I want to implement ageUSD from scratch for the Cardano blockchain. All hypothetical. \*cough\* Definitely not making a stablecoin pinned to the value of 1 shrimp. \*cough\*

What takeaways should I have about the bearwhale saga? Are there any exploits in the fundamental concept of ageUSD that have been exposed in the last few days? If I opt to get my price data from a singular oracle which I run, is there much of a risk for the same manipulation we have seen going on?

[05/14/2021 1:10 PM] Meltpool#9999
I understand the delay/rounding introduced into the oracle after the v1 ageUSD attacks. Doesn‚Äôt change that the oracle data feels less ‚Äúreal world, off-chain‚Äù if it lags behind CoinGecko by 6 hours.
Would more widespread adoption mean more balanced market forces, or would it just mean more whales to frontrun if the oracle became more accurate again?
Speculative questions only receive speculative answers at best, but I‚Äôm still curious what your guys‚Äôs opinions are.


[05/14/2021 1:13 PM] Meltpool#9999
I suppose sigUSD/ERG and sigRSV/ERG pairs would at least allow for holders to close their long/shorts even when the reserve is above 800 or below 400. Whales will have less power over the protocol.


[05/14/2021 1:16 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
The issue with the oracle ran a little deeper I think. If everyone would play by the rules, yes I believe a real-time oracle value would be OK, but we were seeing DDOS attacks to try and ensure gains from short term volatility. However it is a stablecoin protocol first and foremost, not a speculation trading system. So in effect, as long as the oracle price reaches the true price within a decent timeframe, the protocol remains completely functional for its intended purpose but can't be used to 'game' market volatility on mega-short timeframes, as it was being used for


[05/14/2021 1:17 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
Basically the revenue into the treasury that sigRSV holders can rightfully claim (ergo the sigRSV gains) is meant to come from the fees that users pay when interacting, and not just from erg's appreciation


[05/14/2021 1:19 PM] Meltpool#9999
Very good points. I understand.


[05/14/2021 1:20 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
Thanks! I like to think of sigmaUSD as tether. Still a ton of uses for tether in the bull market, and with creating a pegged coin being so difficult, Ageusd is a very good protocol in how simplistic it is. In a way, we can thank the bear whale for their stress testing, which they actually paid RSV holders to perform.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[05/14/2021 1:24 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
On your original question though, yes widespread adoption would really help the protocol. The more users, the higher the total reserve, and the harder it is to change the reserve ratio to profit from volatility


[05/14/2021 1:27 PM] Vesi Hiisi#2550
I like that the oracle price change is slower paced. No matter how fast it would be, there would still be faster frontrunners.

Slowness levels the playing field between normies and expert traders. Which fits well with the ethos.

The reliable slowness can also reflect to smaller erg price volatility, if the usage becomes significant.


[05/14/2021 2:40 PM] Schmime#2221
Hi friends could someone plz explain why the blog post says we should redeem our RSV?


[05/14/2021 2:51 PM] anon_real#2768
Current reserver ratio is unhealthy (+2000%). Now that SigRSV holders are in a good position, they should redeem to prevent manipulation. Please also inform others to do that until the reserve ratio becomes somehow healthy.

"Final balance" for how much ERG is in the reserve and under Show for tokens you can see how many SigUSD and SigRSV have been issued. That doesn't give you the oracle price for ERG, but it gives you everything else.


[05/14/2021 10:26 PM] JamesKelley#2466
That is how much of the tokens the smart contract holds. Whatever is missing from the next 1,000,... number is how much is in curculation.

If you aren't in profit, don't cash out though, it's people like me who got in early and made 20% who need to leave!

[05/15/2021 12:46 AM] MrSupercool#7391
Is the Oracle on the SigmaUSD broken or something? Been showing around $6 all day while it has been closer to $9


[05/15/2021 1:01 AM] JamesKelley#2466
The updates slowly move in the direction of price action so that violent wicks cannot manipulate the reserve. Every 12 minutes or so the price will move up to 5% (I think it is 5%) of the value.


[05/15/2021 1:01 AM] MrSupercool#7391
ahhh


[05/15/2021 1:02 AM] MrSupercool#7391
Thanks


[05/15/2021 1:17 AM] JamesKelley#2466
One thing people can do to prevent whale manipulation is to buy SigUSD. Every SigUSD you buy is one a malicious whale cannot buy.


[05/15/2021 1:20 AM] Snax#3268
How many people are using sigUSD right now?


[05/15/2021 1:21 AM] Snax#3268
like, how many people own sigRSV or sigUSD


[05/15/2021 1:21 AM] Snax#3268
does anyone have that data?


[05/15/2021 1:21 AM] Snax#3268
or, how many people use Ergo in general


[05/15/2021 1:34 AM] JamesKelley#2466
The number of wallets and activity is available from on-chain data but being listed on more exchanges would likely help in the short term. I believe there will be a lot of Cardano users holding ERG when the Dex comes online.


[05/15/2021 1:39 AM] Snax#3268
yeah, I'll probably buy some ERGs then


[05/15/2021 1:39 AM] Snax#3268
but do you have a figure?


[05/15/2021 1:39 AM] Snax#3268
like 3k people? 6k?


[05/15/2021 1:39 AM] Snax#3268
I'm trying to imagine how much the average person puts into sigUSD


[05/15/2021 1:40 AM] Snax#3268
to calculate stake rewards on cardano


[05/15/2021 2:00 AM] JamesKelley#2466
I'm not sure, I wish the Richlist on the Ergo Explorer showed more than the Top 100.


[05/15/2021 2:02 AM] quokka#1273
Where does the sigUSD website get data for the price of erg? It‚Äôs not accurate right now


[05/15/2021 3:18 AM] JamesKelley#2466
From oracle pools, the price is designed to move slow to prevent manipulation, it will eventually catch up.

üëç 

[05/15/2021 3:40 AM] Snax#3268
I was wondering, because the oracle pools move so slow, isn't it possible to exploit that by buying a bunch of sigUSD if the price of erg on exchanges tanks, and buy reserve if it goes up? Doesn't the former suck the reserves dry, hurting sigRSV holders?


[05/15/2021 3:42 AM] Snax#3268
I understand that the fee exists to mitigate this, but if the price of erg falls by more than 2%, there exists an incentive to do it.


[05/15/2021 3:47 AM] JamesKelley#2466
We can all participate instead if a whale creating a wick right before an update.


[05/15/2021 6:03 AM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
Kind of? You would be exposed to a risk of the price recovering and potentially reversing your position, buy you could time it well so you only lost ~4% in worst - case. I think your point is great - worth thinking about more


[05/15/2021 6:33 AM] Snax#3268
I see the potential for a sort of terrible arbitrage, where a person systematically buys ageUSD at even the slightest dip and sells it on a DEX for a profit, and then repeats. The only thing I see that prevents this from happening is the fee. The lower the resolution of the oracle pool, the more feasible this exploit is.


[05/15/2021 6:34 AM] Snax#3268
The only solution I can imagine is to increase oracle pool resolution, but that costs a lot, right?


[05/15/2021 6:35 AM] Snax#3268
at least on Cardano, each oracle's posting is ~45 cents USD. That makes posting more than hourly really expensive and infeasible without external incentives


[05/15/2021 6:36 AM] Snax#3268
fees are a lot less on Ergo, I imagine.

[05/15/2021 12:22 PM] Vesi Hiisi#2550
We have discussed this on telegram side today as well. 

One idea was slowing down the redeem process. For example, redeem now, get erg 24 hours later. That would give the oracle price time to catch up.


[05/15/2021 8:00 PM] Snax#3268
I did some thinking, and found that it might be possible to change the price on the fly. For example, if someone buys a significant amount of sigUSD, we could increase the price to discourage exploitation of the inaccurate price.


[05/15/2021 8:00 PM] Snax#3268
at least until the oracle updates it


[05/15/2021 8:05 PM] Snax#3268
Ooh, I think I have a better idea.

We could also "lock" orders to buy until the next oracle update comes. When it comes, if the price is lower than the price they "locked in" at, the order fills at the oracle price. If it is higher, the order is cancelled.

The same but flipped for sell orders.


[05/15/2021 8:07 PM] Snax#3268
if someone wants sigUSD instantly, they can just get it on an exchange.


[05/15/2021 8:07 PM] Snax#3268
This guarantees that all orders would be filled at a relatively fair price


[05/15/2021 8:11 PM] Snax#3268
if a person wants it really bad, they can set their lock price much higher than the market price right now, but either way, it fills at the oracle price if it's lower than the lock.


[05/15/2021 9:22 PM] Vesi Hiisi#2550
Interesting ideas. I'm going to gather all these, and try to figure out what is best.

In general, I think some mechanism may be needed. I like it slow and simple, but the fact that its not real time may need to be countered.


[05/16/2021 1:51 AM] JamesKelley#2466
Since the price is moving slow, a whale cannot create a situation that only they can benefit from on an exchage. We can all buy/sell which means nobody has an advantage.


[05/16/2021 1:52 AM] JamesKelley#2466
The bearwhale guy has only lost money since the changes were made to the oracle. When the price moved fast he was able to clean up.


[05/16/2021 1:54 AM] JamesKelley#2466
People are only noticing right now because the price moved higher very fast. I think it should be better if there a smoothing algorythm applied to the price changes so that it could catch up quicker but also not be responsive to large wicks a whale might be able to create right before an update from the oracles.


[05/16/2021 3:22 AM] JamesKelley#2466
@Snax I would like to be able to submit orders where it just converts the token directly into another token without specifying the price  (with slippage protection).


[05/16/2021 3:24 AM] Snax#3268
sort of like a moving average


[05/16/2021 4:10 AM] Snax#3268
@JamesKelley How is the price of reserve tokens calculated?


[05/16/2021 5:45 AM] JamesKelley#2466
That is exactly how I was thinking of it. I was also considering what would happen if it were more like an EMA in some cases and how that would affect the tokenomics. Would it be bad if the length of an EMA were longer or shorter depending on how it affects the reserve? In the current situation the reserve ratio is very high which means not enough SigUSD has been minted and nobody can mint new SigRSV. If a whale can mint $2.7mil SigUSD right now but he is going to he might wait for the price to go a little higher because he knows it probably will. If the price were to plunge right now down to $2 he would not hesitate to mint that $2.7mil while he can so that he could buy back ERG at a lower price. So, what if the tail of an EMA or MA was also taking into consideration how the action affects the reserve? I'm sort of thinking while typing.


[05/16/2021 5:47 AM] JamesKelley#2466

[05/16/2021 5:52 AM] JamesKelley#2466
That shows that there is 1,001,210.751271439 ERG held in the smart contract and that it also holds 9,999,393,375,978 SigRSV and 99,999,654,423.1 SigUSD.
Any SigRSV/SigUSD missing from those numbers if they were rounded-up are in circulation. (In this example, 606,624,022 SigRSV, which is what you see displayed on the site),


[05/16/2021 5:52 AM] JamesKelley#2466
The ERG in the smart contract has to cover the SigUSD currently minted, so take that amount out based on the current price of ERG.


[05/16/2021 5:54 AM] JamesKelley#2466
The price listed on the website, currently $9.54 is rounded. The precise number is available from the oracle pool:
https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/oracle-pool-state/ergusd
... which currently shows: $9.54137228233451


[05/16/2021 5:57 AM] JamesKelley#2466
345,576.91 SigUSD/$9.54137228233451 = 36,218.7848639 ERG set aside for covering the SigUSD.


[05/16/2021 5:59 AM] JamesKelley#2466
1,001,210.751271439 ERG in contract - 36,218.7848639 ERG set aside for SigUSD = 964,991.966408 ERG in reserve that belongs to the SigRSV token holders.


[05/16/2021 6:00 AM] JamesKelley#2466
964,991.966408 ERG in reserve/606,624,022 SigRSV tokens in circulation = 0.00159075791, which is the price of SigRSV in ERG.


[05/16/2021 6:02 AM] JamesKelley#2466
That math was close to what is show, the difference is rounding errors between my calculator and the ones used in the smart contract and website.

I could be wrong about the bearwhale. It could just be a hero instead.


[05/16/2021 9:39 PM] Rich#6507
I have tried and failed to redeem RSV a few times (which I get), but my latest attempt the refund transaction is showing "Transaction with this ID was not found, or it has not entered the Mempool yet".  Is this something that will self-correct when the load decreases or do I need to perform additional action?


[05/16/2021 9:43 PM] JamesKelley#2466
@Rich I see a 6m Sig RSV refund in the mempool. I'm not an expert in that part, does it say a refund is pending?


[05/16/2021 9:45 PM] Rich#6507
On the website it says that a refund is pending, and I've received a couple refunds today.  The most recent one, when I click on the link to go to the explorer does not seem to match a transaction.


[05/16/2021 9:46 PM] Rich#6507
In the past I have accidentally sent the default 0.001 Erg in which case, I don't think the refund could work.  I don't believe I did that in this case, but I might try to send a little more Erg to the contract address to see if it helps.


[05/16/2021 9:52 PM] JamesKelley#2466
I've been watching the blocks, the last block didn't have any transactions included which for some reason. I see pools do that often.


[05/16/2021 9:53 PM] JamesKelley#2466
Oh, another block from the same pool loaded with transactions just came through.


[05/16/2021 9:56 PM] Rich#6507
I still don't see my refund transaction in the mempool yet.


[05/16/2021 9:57 PM] Rich#6507
I'm hopeful that it will just take a bit of time.


[05/16/2021 10:10 PM] JamesKelley#2466

Fully automatic, Decentralized (slightly better than a) ponzi scheme:

1. Reserve pool with no stablecoin it is backing.
2. 2% fee on each purchase of the reserve coin, which goes to the members of the pool.
3. Price of the reserve coin is equal to amount of ADA in the reserve pool divided by number of reserve tokens exist
4. We stake the ADA in the pool and 100% of the rewards goes to the reserve pool.


[05/19/2021 2:06 AM] Snax#3268
Once enough people join, it's basically just a staking pool but with fees to use it.

Do you know if there needs to be any special considerations regarding the withdrawal of rewards on the Cardano side if controlled by a smart contract? Rewards are held separately from the regular ADA balance and requite a special withdraw command.


[05/19/2021 2:57 AM] Snax#3268
There probably are, but it could be resolved pretty easily by just having the smart contract instantly spend the rewards it gets, and just create a normal UTxO (it owns) with the rewards to avoid a special case.


[05/19/2021 3:00 AM] Snax#3268
That would be significantly affected by fees, but with a large enough reserve pool it wouldn't matter.


[05/19/2021 3:01 AM] Snax#3268
we could also just wait until a threshold amount of rewards are accumulated


[05/19/2021 7:50 AM] Snax#3268
Thinking about creating Shrimpcoin first on the Ergo blockchain, and then separately on the Cardano blockchain with alonzo. I could then have a way to move Shrimpcoin between the chains that is just basically burning the Shrimpcoin on one chain, freeing up that amount of that reserve, and then minting an equivalent amount on the other chain (minus fees), locking up the required amount on that chain's reserve.


[05/19/2021 7:50 AM] Snax#3268
I'd love to make something for Ergo

just wanted to add that there is a 4.5% fee total for entering and exiting sigRSV positions, saw it mentioned in the previous graphic and wanted to make sure it didn't get left out in any calculations people intend to do


[05/19/2021 7:20 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
At some point, will we be able to stake our sigUSD from our own wallet to earn an APY something like waves.exchange USDN? Just saw they have 13% APR with USDN staking which is really good. The sigUSD would be used for liquidity of the DEX im presuming.

Yeah, probably.

[05/20/2021 1:06 AM] nitram147#5106
However when I tried it seems that the font which sigmausd website use doesn't support these types of diacritis characters:


[05/20/2021 1:07 AM] nitram147#5106
"≈°ƒæ≈°ƒç≈•≈æ√Ω√Ω√°√≠√©√§≈à√∫√¥"


[05/20/2021 1:08 AM] nitram147#5106
Another thing is that I had to rewrite a bit i18n tags so for for example "AgeUSD Protocol" would became "AgeUSD Protokol", "here" would became "tu" and etc.


[05/20/2021 1:08 AM] nitram147#5106

Its a stable coin. So without knowing where you live: probably yes.

Unfortunately Slovak aren't there. Same goes for Czech characters (I'm planning to do also Czech language translation). It could be quite good for the project (It's true that many Slovak & Czech technically experience people understand English, but common people on the internet even the older erga pople with >40age, are not that good in English). In Slovakia and Czech republic there is probably one of the strongest cryptocurrency communities in the world.

I'm trying to work on a graphic or a video if possible on sigmausd.io. I did a very brief write up trying to sum up how one could lose or earn ergs and how the system works. Can anyone tell me if I got something wrong? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CC9p9APNclgg0S52NA5eOwZq1lZPoZZYvZkN4uKUvMI/edit?usp=sharing

What is SigmaUSD? A stable coin backed by Erg cryptocurrency reserves Its value is pegged to $1  How it works: If value of Erg is $10, you get 10 SigmaUSD when you store 1 Erg with SigmaUSD.io If the value of Erg happens to go down to $5 and you now want to redeem your 10 SigmaUSD in exchange for...

[05/25/2021 7:50 AM] carlin#9836
I also have a couple of doubts
1. How is the Reserve Ratio calculated?
2. What factors determine erg to SigRSV price. I'm guessing price of Erg and Reserve Ratio, but is it weighted in some or way or is it an obvious calculation?
3. What happens when price of Erg drastically falls, SigUSD users need to be compensated and the reserves run out before more people decide to mint SigRSV?


[05/25/2021 8:05 AM] abchris#8522
Good job. Nothing incorrect per se, but I in the sigUSD section I would use a different language than "losing" or "gaining" Ergs. Mention it is a stable coin. Also say something about the protocol fees as that's a major piece of the puzzle in enticing people to mint sigRSV.


[05/25/2021 8:12 AM] abchris#8522
The reserve ratio, iirc, is (total-erg-in-bank / minted-sigmaUSD) / ERG/USD-rate


[05/25/2021 8:12 AM] carlin#9836
I was keeping the fees part out in order to not include percentages and weird numbers. But I'll add a note how platform fees collected form an additional profit for SigRSV users


[05/25/2021 8:18 AM] abchris#8522 (pinned)
Re 2. SigRSV price is a function of Erg price, minted sigUSD, minted sigRSV and total ERG in reserves. See ageusd for actual formulas: https://github.com/Emurgo/age-usd/blob/main/ageusd-headless/src/bank.rs

I am wondering doesn't this erode trust in a stable coin? I guess it is a pretty extreme situation, but still.


[05/25/2021 8:24 AM] carlin#9836
Thanks! Saw you post this on Telegram and had tried sprucing it up. Though I'm a bit away from fully grasping it myself üôÇ


[05/25/2021 8:26 AM] abchris#8522
Nothing is perfect. If you're not in a rush, the chances the RR stays under 100% are rather small IMO, because the incentive to mint RSV gets higher with low RR's.


[05/25/2021 8:27 AM] abchris#8522
So you can always wait it out.


[05/25/2021 8:27 AM] abchris#8522
Also, the oracle is smoothed out, which gives more time to redeem.


[05/25/2021 8:28 AM] Vesi Hiisi#2550
Imo it increases trust in stablecoin.

There is no way to completely avoid collateral losing value. This applies in all financial products.

What the algostables can do, is to design how that situation plays out. Most leave it up to market forces and arbitrage. However, this adds to lack of trust in crash, as we just saw with USDN and Terra.

In ageUSD, everyone can see the situation playing out in slow motion. Anyone in sigUSD has plenty of time to exit at 1$ value. Rsv holders carry the risk, as it should be.

Therefore, I think ageusd mechanism in crash situation is more fair, transparent and trustworthy.


[05/25/2021 8:35 AM] carlin#9836
Fair enough, yes. SigRSV users will always carry the risk but in an exceptional market situation, SigUSD users should be prepared to wait it out for a while or take the loss. It is certainly more fair and transparent but does carry marginal risk


[05/25/2021 8:38 AM] Vesi Hiisi#2550
If your sigUSD is locked somewhere, then yes. Otherwise you will have several days of time to redeem at 1$, with the current oracle smoothing setting.

Also, when it goes close to 100%, I assume most people will redeem, because at 80% you would only get 80c for example.

 So I dont think that people will wait it out, if it goes to 100%.

Troubleshooting:
Transactions can fail when the oracle refreshes during (and the price changes). In this event the funds will be returned to your connected wallet. 

Use this link for a refund anytime if your funds become 'stuck' in a proxy address:  https://assm.sigmausd.io/return/your_address_set_in_ui/the_long_address_you_sent_to

[05/26/2021 1:15 AM] arokace#8057
Is this popup for converting erg to SigRSV just so you can save the info/track it.  Not actually needed to do anything else once you hit redeem and see this screen with the timer on it?


[05/26/2021 1:18 AM] Nythain#6769
Cant give a difinitive answer but it was a non important popup when i was minting. Thought it was a "you have this countdown to complete transaction" thing but even after transaction it was there so i was like "close" lol


[05/26/2021 1:19 AM] arokace#8057
ok, so its probably just so you can log it yourself then.  Yea I was a little concerned I missed something to when I just did.  Also read in that yoroi can show your sigma that you have?  Is taht right?


[05/26/2021 1:23 AM] Nythain#6769
I have to google that. If so that would be awesome.


[05/26/2021 1:27 AM] Nythain#6769

[05/26/2021 2:51 AM] arokace#8057
ok what am I doing wrong with trying to get some SigmaRSV.  Does ergo's official wallet work with it?  I haven't lost any coin or anything, the minting just hasn't gone through still I guess

[05/26/2021 5:31 AM] Dmitry Usov#0134
I said to oracle pool operators increase the miner fee. Hope it will help. Oracle transactions will go to the very end, because transactions in mempool has higher fee.

Thanks, that makes sense!


[05/26/2021 3:45 PM] danandbeard#3509
I'm not sure I understand the purpose of a stablecoin that's stable wrt $erg - my naive understanding of stablecoins was that crypto is volatile and a stablecoin allows you to move in and out of fiat more easily


[05/26/2021 3:45 PM] danandbeard#3509
if sigmaUSD is supposed to stay 1:1 with $erg - why not just trade $erg?


[05/26/2021 3:46 PM] danandbeard#3509
is this like a layer2 solution to scale transactions (presuming max tx/sec on ERG is slow relative to sigmaUSD)?


[05/26/2021 3:52 PM] Vesi Hiisi#2550
1 sigUSD is 1$ in ERG.

So, at ERG price of 1$, 1 sigUSD = 1 ERG.

At ERG price of 10$, 1 sigUSD = 0.1 ERG.


[05/26/2021 4:04 PM] Mikki#4090
SigmaUSD is made to be 1:1 with the actual USD, not ERG
hypothetically, if you turn 10 ERG into 10 SigmaUSD, the value of that will always be $10
but if the price of ERG increases by 10x, your 10 SigmaUSD will only be 1 ERG.
and if the price of ERG decreases by 10x, your 10 SigmaUSD will be worth 100 ERG.
you haven't technically made or lost money in either scenario because you still have $10 worth, but obviously you'd rather have more ERG. 

basically, if you're expecting ERG to drop, turn it into SigmaUSD. and if you're expecting to go up, turn it into SigmaRSV.


[05/26/2021 4:08 PM] danandbeard#3509
ohhhh, that makes more sense

[05/26/2021 8:47 PM] nitram147#5106
Probably it would be better to do another "smaller" round. I know that there are a few missing i18n keys - for example key for "refund mined" text (because the text is in .js file not in the .tsx, but it would be great to have translation also for these texts). So I would give it another round, to go through file by file and check that really all of the texts which will be ever shown to user have their i18n key added and translation implemented.

A few updates on the UI are required, such as fixing the "white text on the white dropdown menu" in Mozilla browsers (in language selection drop down), in Chromium it looks good, in Mozilla it isn't.


[05/26/2021 8:51 PM] nitram147#5106
We should do also the font update, and it seems that on the Slovak translation the wallet icon in the set wallet button is missing - but again only in the Mozilla browser, in Chromium it works normaly. So I would probably investigate it a bit deeper, once I find a time üôÇ

Maybe it would be great to know which all messages (excluding the one included in .tsx files) are shown to user during any phase of the sigmausd minting/redeeming etc. So I/we don't have to go through all the .js files and look for the addition texts like the "refund mined" which had to be replaced by the corresponding translation üôÇ

Still not understanding how to do Sigma.  I've tried 3 times now and nothing has happened.  Is there something I'm missing that I need to do other than loading my wallet into the site and purchasing whichever sigma I want?


[05/27/2021 6:05 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
What exactly do you mean by "nothing has happened"? Did you send the exact amount of ERG to the address provided? What happened? Can you see a transaction highlighted in red saying "refund mined" on the sigmaUSD.io dashboard?

Well that solves that issue, I completely didn't read the first word on the 2 copiable things when you hit purchase.  Now I just need to figure out what happened to my 1 erg that might or might not have disappeared into a random address

Hey Glasgow, I've encountered the same problem. I had just assumed that V1 SigRSV would roll over into V2 SigRSV. In hindsight, it makes sense why it didn't, but I'm not so sure what to do now since the V1 SigUSD supply seems to have been locked at the same amount for at least a day now (maybe longer). Is there anything I can do? Or anyway I could be notified of when V1 SigUSD supply changes?


[05/30/2021 10:23 PM] angrymoose#7520

what fee is there in addition to the .195 erg fee listed?


[05/31/2021 12:09 AM] angrymoose#7520
ohhhh. The fee listed is the .25% implementor fee and the the higher price for purchasing is due to the 2% protocol fee? Is that right?


[05/31/2021 2:22 PM] gravity#6476
I think there is always a 0.01 erg fee whenever a token is transfered. It would probably be less confusing if both of the fees were increased by 0.01 instead of using different conversion rates for purchasing and redeeming.

[05/31/2021 3:54 PM] cliddell#9456
I've looked a bit more into the AgeUSD protocol to understand the problem behind not being able to redeem the V1 SigRSV which is currently locked up until someone redeems some V1 SigUSD. It seems there's a very likely chance that much of the remaining SigUSD and SigRSV belong to lost wallets and will likely never be redeemed.
Would it be out of the question to just close the V1 SigUSD portal and send back the remaining held ERG to each of the corresponding addresses which are still holding V1 SigUSD/RSV? Or, if that's not possible, would it be possible to lower the required reserve ratio so that more people with SigRSV can withdraw their ERG which is currently locked up indefinitely?


[05/31/2021 3:54 PM] cliddell#9456
@glasgowm


[05/31/2021 4:23 PM] arokace#8057
When I noticed the V1 was still purchasable and separate from V2 and was never "converted over" or whatever.  It has left me a little bit of a worryness to minting either coin.  What if they come out with a V3, most people  will be dumping their Sigma then to go to V3 which will leave some people 'shit out of luck'.  

I still have SigRSV Minted but still...  I really hope that if they make a V3 they let us just convert it all over or something because under 400% ratio, you can't redeem SigRSV.


[05/31/2021 4:55 PM] nitram147#5106
It depends on the underlying smart contract. If it did not contain the "transfer to new version" feature, all the funds will be locked there forever (in reality: tokens - for the next 4 years until the miner can spent them, thanks to the concept of storage fee, ergs - for the next x years where x = 4*n, n>=1, based on the amount of erg  locked there - again, only miner can take them away). To my knowledge (don't take it as a fact), there isn't any "transfer to new version" feature built in v1 (see github to see corresponding smart contracts source code - I don't remember it, and I'm on mobile now so I cannot look it up).


[05/31/2021 4:55 PM] nitram147#5106
Same goes probably for the reserve ratio - it's hardcoded in the underlying smart contract. So nothing can be done about it üôÇ


[05/31/2021 5:54 PM] arokace#8057
Yea that's what I figured.  Guess either hope a V3 isn't needed or if it is I just see it in time to get my erg back


[05/31/2021 7:57 PM] cliddell#9456
I figured that might be the case. I just thought it might be worth it trying to get feedback directly from a developer üòï


[05/31/2021 7:59 PM] cliddell#9456
Haha, yeah. I still have some ERG not locked up in V1 that I‚Äôve been debating on putting into V2. If I had some confirmation the same thing wouldn‚Äôt happen, I‚Äôd probably do it, but I don‚Äôt want to get burned twice.


[05/31/2021 8:05 PM] arokace#8057
I would think it would be best to get them out of V1 and into V2.  Eventually V1 will definitely be locked up.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to fix it


[06/01/2021 12:38 PM] Snax#3268
If my understanding is right, then the bank box is consumed and created with every transaction. Doesn't this mean that there is a hard limit of 1 transaction/block for the sigUSD protocol? Also, if more than one person tried to spend the bank box in a single block, do all transactions that tried to consume the now-spent bank box get cancelled? If so, how does the interface deal with this? Does the off-chain code just keep broadcasting transactions spending the bank box until one goes through?


[06/01/2021 2:15 PM] nitram147#5106
You are right, that you have to recreate the bank box each time you use the contract. You can chain transactions in the same block. 

Legend:Ti (i>=0) is transaction, Idj(j>=0) is UTxO id.

T0: Id0 -> Id1
T1: Id1 -> Id2
T2: Id2 -> Id3

T0, T1, T2 can be mined in the same block (it's ok that T1 is spending UTxO created in T0).

However I don't know how is this case handled in the sigmausd site backend.


[06/01/2021 2:17 PM] nitram147#5106
But if you have central point of interaction with the smart contract, you can always chain transactions like in the example with T0, T1, T2 so they can be all mined inside the same block. Unfortunately if somebody else publish transaction spending the same UTxO via relay to network, it could break your constructed transactions.

(Once his transaction will be included first)

Is the ergo assembler used for the auction house the same as the one used for sigmaUSD ?


[06/02/2021 3:49 PM] glasgowm#9381
it's not the same instance but it's the same thing yeh


[06/02/2021 3:52 PM] angrymoose#7520
Cool. I was just wondering if there were any needed changes in the code.


[06/02/2021 3:54 PM] angrymoose#7520
Are there any plans to implement the Yoroi dapp connector? Or is the plan to wait until that reaches a higher level of maturity?


[06/02/2021 3:56 PM] glasgowm#9381
@anon_real would be able to tell you - he's also implementing the dApp connector, there were some missing bindings or something that had to be added first.

[06/02/2021 4:08 PM] anon_real#2768
The assembler is a simple entity that is able to work with any dApp. So no change is needed for different dApps. And yes, dApp connector will be integrated soon hopefully.

Hi there, I was in the Ergo Forum asking about a SigRSV transaction problem and the geologist suggested asking here. Short form, tried to do a transaction while the smart contract was down. Funds appear in the smart contract account, but I'm not sure what to do at this point. Details are in the forum post: https://www.ergoforum.org/t/sigmausd-down-cant-buy-or-sell-rsv-or-sigmausd/1610/3

SigmaUSD down. Cant Buy or sell RSV or SigmaUSD
My problem is that I was helping someone with a transaction, and it appears the contract may have been down when it was sent. The receiving address associated with the smart contract accepted the funds, but it did not send them to the contract or back to the original wallet. They currently remain in the address.  I was hoping that once that smar...

Check one of the pinned messages from Glasgow.  Might be that it got stuck, there's a way to get the ergo to return so you can do the process over again.


[06/04/2021 7:17 PM] arokace#8057
You actually sent Ergo from your wallet to the address given by Sigma, correct?

Yes, it isn't yet updated with the `Height` part. I got busy with other stuff, will work on it soon.
However, in the meantime, there is no need to worry about the `assemblerNode`. Its mnemonic is backed up carefully and @kushti also has it.

The fonts had to be replaced by the "full" version of the same fonts from the google fonts. This will unfortunately increase their size 5-10 times. So it  will make first load of sigmausd.io site a bit longer. However it has to be done, especially for a few Czech characters...

u guys think its worth getting sigmarsv right now?


[06/06/2021 3:23 PM] bk#4411
The content is great but I found the UX a bit confusing. It looks like a flow chart from a glance (with the connected boxes and translucent arrows) and it‚Äôs not. It wasn‚Äôt clear where your eyes should ‚Äústart‚Äù.


[06/06/2021 3:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
What would you suggest? Maybe a bit of text above the two boxes saying `Your redeemable erg varies depending on the following scenarios`


[06/06/2021 4:35 PM] nitram147#5106
@glasgowm  You are mentioning that SigRSV cannot be redeemed  in case that the reserve ratio is lower than 400%. But in the SigRSV scenario 3, you "low reserves" (which is quite unclear - what the "low" reserves really means?), and you do not mention that in case that ratio < 400%, you cannot get back your ERGs because redeeming is disallowed.


[06/06/2021 4:35 PM] nitram147#5106
---


[06/06/2021 4:37 PM] nitram147#5106
And imho the "flow diagram" UI is OK, people  will start reading in middle or on the side and read it all. However most of the people will read the colored boxes first and do not read the "redeeming sigusd, minting sigusd, minting sigrsv, redeeming sigrsv" text at all or it will be the last thing that they will read


[06/06/2021 4:38 PM] nitram147#5106
(I had shown it to 3 of my friends, and each of them told me that they started to read it from the center with priority on the colorful boxes)


[06/06/2021 6:40 PM] glasgowm#9381
`You are mentioning that SigRSV cannot be redeemed  in case that the reserve ratio is lower than 400%`  

and 

`and you do not mention that in case that ratio < 400%, you cannot get back your ERGs because redeeming is disallowed.` 

seem contradictory to me


[06/06/2021 6:41 PM] nitram147#5106
If people only read colorful boxes they will miss this information


[06/06/2021 6:41 PM] nitram147#5106
I would mention this in the sigrsv scenario 3 box


[06/06/2021 6:42 PM] nitram147#5106
Or put it under the box


[06/06/2021 6:42 PM] nitram147#5106
In the same way as is the other text put under the sigusd scenario 3 box üôÇ


[06/06/2021 6:44 PM] nitram147#5106
Or make the upper text (with not colorful background) more attractive to readers visually - I don't know how, but based on my three friends, all of them skipped reading it, and read it only after they have read all the colorful text + they told me that they just run with eyes over it and did not read the details

hello! can anyone clear me on this. i had prev 6000 sigRsv . and now i bought some more.. altho id doesnt show on the website the total ammount including the new purchuase. only the ammount of the latest purchase . but on my yoroi wallet it shows the full ammount . any reason why?


[06/13/2021 1:54 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
It possibly got sent to a different yoroi wallet address, you can have multiple, the sigma page only loads one, but yoroi loads the total of all. If it's showing in yoroi I wouldn't worry about it!


[06/13/2021 3:08 PM] stakeman#4490
my worry is . how do i go about if i want to revert back all of my sum of sigRsv

if its np and i can do both sums at the same time

There's ones in the pinned messages but the actual profit is impossible to calculate as it depends on how sigmausd is used within that time

I'm happy to add a Dutch translation for SigmaUSD, but don't know (yet) how to create an issue/commit etc.


[06/18/2021 3:25 PM] bk#4411
@Dmitry Usov @anon_real can we enable the wiki and/or discussions on `anon-real/sigma-usd`? If so, I can document the process for adding a translation to help people like @Platypus get started. ‚òùÔ∏è


[06/18/2021 4:03 PM] nitram147#5106
First start by downloading translation.json file from the public/locales/en/ folder.


[06/18/2021 4:04 PM] nitram147#5106
Translate it to dutch language - replace the text with the dutch equivalents


[06/18/2021 4:05 PM] nitram147#5106
When you will have it done, I will guide you on what to do next üòâ Just tag me here, and I'm gonna reply to you with instructions üôÇ


[06/18/2021 4:08 PM] nitram147#5106
@bk Could you please elaborate how to make a translation also for text such as "result mined", " returning funds" etc. They are not hardcoded into the .tsx file, but are placed here by js. Once it will be translation ready, we will add (I will add Slovak&Czech translations, @Enhacker  will add Swedish translation) the corresponding translation. Once it will be done, all of the needed translations would be completed üòäüôÇ Thank you (I've seen that you're a frontend js guy, so you will probably find a pretier solution than me)


[06/18/2021 4:20 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
yes, just need to add more characters


[06/18/2021 4:20 PM] bk#4411
@nitram147 those statuses in the "History" section are the raw states.  If you look in `src/utils/assembler.js` you can see those strings being set to indicate state, but then the History section just dumps them directly to the UI, rather than running them through the translation code. I don't think we could provided translations just of those words because you couldn't control the order (is it "results mined" or "mined results" per language). If I have some time, I can take a look at it this weekend.

I remove it from font bundlers because want to reduce font sizes


[06/18/2021 4:22 PM] nitram147#5106
Yeah, I understad, could you do it or point me to the way how to strip unnecessary characters from the full font variants from google fonts? üôÇ


[06/18/2021 4:25 PM] nitram147#5106
We would provide specific translation for all the situation which can happen so example if there can be "refund mined", "returning" etc we will introduce a new i18n keys to the translation.json files. But the question would be if we can somehow use function from i18n library or we had to manually load content of translation.json file and use the specified keys for translation. However it has to be done so everything will be translated, otherwise it's like a half baked pie üôÇ


[06/18/2021 4:26 PM] bk#4411
yeah, I think we would need translation keys for each semantic combination of states.


[06/18/2021 4:27 PM] nitram147#5106
Yeah, that's ok, just a few new lines in translation.json. What bothers me is how to do it üôÇ

Tutorial for adding of translation for some language to the SigmaUSD project
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.) Log in / Create a github account
2.) Navigate to https://github.com/anon-real/sigma-usd and in the upper right corner click on "Fork" to fork repository to your account
3.) Navigate to fork on your profile (for example for me it would be https://github.com/nitram147/sigma-usd)
4.) Click on green "Code" button and copy the link (it will look such as: https://github.com/nitram147/sigma-usd.git)
5.) Open terminal and go to the directory where you want to store files from SigmaUSD project
6.) Execute command `git clone link` for example for me it would be `git clone https://github.com/nitram147/sigma-usd.git`
7.) Create new folder for your language in `sigma-usd/public/locales/` with a name corresponding to the shortcut of your language, you can find your language shortcut at https://lingohub.com/academy/best-practices/iso-639-1-list . So for example if you wanted to do a translation for Slovak language (which shortcut is `sk`) you have to make a folder `sigma-usd/public/locales/sk/`
8.) Copy `translation.json` file from `sigma-usd/public/locales/en/` to your folder
9.) Translate it into your language
10.) Navigate to `sigma-usd/src/components/Header/` and edit `Header.tsx` file - add `<option value="xy">XY</option>` where xy is equal to the shortcut of your language, so for example for Slovak language it would be `<option value="sk">SK</option>`
11.) Optional step (recommended) - try if it looks like you want (more to this step bellow)

12.) Once it's ok, add new files by `git add *`
13.) Execute `git status` and check that all the files (translation.json + your langage folder + Header.tsx) you have created or modified are shown by green text here
14.) Execute `git commit` (or `git commit -S` if you are using GPG key, if you don't know what GPG key is, just use `git commit`), type the commit name, for example "Translation to Slovak language", hit enter
15.) Push your new commit into your repository `git push` , you will be asked to log in into github by your credentials via terminal
16.) Check your repository in web browser that the new commit is there
17.) In your forked version of sigma-usd repository (such as https://github.com/your_name/sigma-usd)), click on "Contribute" and select "Open pull request".
18.) Write a short text about your pull request, for example "I'd like to submit my translation into language XYZ"
19.) Hit open pull request button and wait until it will be approved and merged üôÇ
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps required for trying how it looks:
- have `npm` installed
1.) Navigate to your sigma-usd folder on your PC
2.) Execute `npm install` (if you did not done it before - this is needed only first time)
3.) Execute `npm run start`, a modified version of the sigma-usd site will be opened in your browser (running on your PC)
4.) Check that your translation work as it should

@nitram147 you might add directions for using GitHub Codespaces too which would potentially be less intimidating for novices.

[06/20/2021 12:23 PM] nitram147#5106
(like some easy way, I could replace the assembler address with my api which will simulate various responses, but if there's an easier way)


[06/20/2021 8:43 PM] bk#4411
@nitram147 I don't know a great way to simulate the data, but you can hack in some mock data. The history is just stored in `localStorage`, so you could open the app in a private tab and then run something like this in the devtool console:  https://gist.github.com/bdkent/80109315cf3ea251ae867352ce62c7df.  This will replace what is there, so make sure to use a private tab!

Any text editor would be great for such a easy task üôÇ 

In general I'm huge fan and supporter of open-source software, however I have to admit that for me the best editor is Sublime Text v3 (however it's proprietary üò¶ ) 

For each programming language there's a "best" editor just for it, but what I like about Sublime is that there's build-in/downloadable plugins so I'm using it for bunch of languages (c, c++, python, php etc.). I have a clean experience so I can use the same editor shortcuts, multiple cursors, great search (even across tons of files at once), great plugins, language server bindings, etc.

And it's running extremely fast (in comparison with Atom or vscode),  even with huge files - editing 1GB text file isn't any problem, even searching in it. Try to do this with Atom and you're a gonna wait, it will be lagging, such a bad experience. With sublime it's incredible fast. So yes, I have to admit that this is one of a few tools where I think that there isn't such a great open-source alternative üôÇ

It looks like the URL at the end of the video end in a zero instead of an `o`.  (`sigmausd.i0` vs `sigmausd.io`)

not so much the ratio being low as to why to buy, but the price of ergo.  Ratio being low just means you can only purchase it, can't redeem it.

what do you mean with the price of ergo?


[06/22/2021 7:01 PM] arokace#8057
Well you want to buy in when you get more SigmaRSV, which happens when the Ergo Price is low.  The idea is that you buy RSV when Ergo is priced low.  Then you sell it back when Ergo is at a higher price to make more Ergo.


[06/22/2021 9:32 PM] Platypus#2410
could also do this for any future launches/dApps

@bk @Dmitry Usov @anon_real Maybe we should rename
```
Purchase SigUSD - (pending)
Purchase SigUSD - (mined)
Purchase SigUSD - (refund mined)
```
To
```
Purchase SigUSD - (pending)
Purchase SigUSD - (completed)
Purchase SigUSD - (refunded)
```
It would be semantically more clear to the user whether the action (purchase/redeem) is pending or it was completed or refunded.

[06/22/2021 10:11 PM] nitram147#5106
At least when I was thinking about it, it's much more clear in Slovak&Czech to use translation equivalent to the latter one version than the original (former one).


[06/22/2021 10:12 PM] nitram147#5106
The newer (proposed) version indicate the state of the action, the older one indicate the state of the transaction belonging to that action.


[06/22/2021 10:13 PM] nitram147#5106
For the user experience it's probably better to use the latter one (based on my opinion).


[06/22/2021 10:13 PM] nitram147#5106
What do you think?


[06/23/2021 1:37 AM] bk#4411
I would tend to agree. When I first purchased some it wasn‚Äôt immediately clear to me that the ‚Äúmined‚Äù state was a completion state.

LOL, so you are talking about sigmausd.io not the auction house xD


[07/11/2021 5:27 PM] anon_real#2768
I thought the issue is with the auction house. For SigmaUSD, @glasgowm please check the node and make sure it is synced.


[07/11/2021 5:28 PM] anon_real#2768
@glasgowm also please consider having more than one node for the assembler like auction house and ergo utils.


[07/11/2021 5:29 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
@anon_real I haven't done any digging into how the assembler works yet. Is it possible for people to host their own assemblers and mint SigmaRSV and SigmaUSD from the same contract as sigmausd.io ? Can anyone make copies of the assembler to make publicly available? I am hoping and assuming that the answer is yes.


[07/11/2021 5:31 PM] essaias#5787
Ok, so sigmausd is *not* fixed yet, right? (as I still get the error ;))


[07/11/2021 5:33 PM] anon_real#2768
Generally, the answer is yes. But in this case, to avoid some attacks that our famous whale was doing, we restricted the proxy contracts to work only with some specific node (mnemonic). However, it may be time to enhance that and it is easy to do.

don't think so, orders have been going through


[07/20/2021 10:44 AM] abchris#8522
Just curious wether anyone had thoughts about the scenario where the reserve ratio would drop to 100% or lower, as that would set the RSV price to its default value of 0.001 ERG (no equity anymore, so can't define a price for it), whereas it is likely to be 10,000x lower when the RR is at 100.01%. Wouldn't this result in some sort of dead-end? No incentive to mint RSV anymore? Am I seeing that right?

I guess, since we have governance now, the contract could be updated in such a situation to set the default RSV price to something close to its last traded value.


[07/20/2021 2:27 PM] glasgowm#9381
There'd be no incentive for RSV but a massive incentive for USD to withdraw, and lots of RSV incentive beforehand (80k ERG minted in the past 2 days for instance). So highly unlikely that happens unless everything drops to (almost) 0 and stayed there

Na the whale address hasnt made a transaction since may. I think this is the friendly whale who put 2 million into sigUSD before the big crash to allow people to take profits from sigRSV. Who knows why he's taking it out now, hopefully he's expecting a huge pump soon...üòÇ

anyone know when they're gonna increase the max for reserve?


[07/26/2021 4:12 PM] G. de Balboa#0001
it's staying capped at 800%


[07/26/2021 4:14 PM] G. de Balboa#0001
once enough sigUSD is minted, current ratio will go down to 800%. If it dips further, people will be able to redeem RSV ... but then there will be more RSV spots available that people will quickly fill up to keep it at close to 800%


[07/26/2021 4:16 PM] G. de Balboa#0001
increasing it beyond 800% to enable more RSV token holders means that distributed rewards for RSV holders will become very diluted. More people = less rewards for everyone involved ... so the team decided they would cap it 800%.


[07/26/2021 6:59 PM] DeepRivers#3610
gotcha ok so the only way to get SigRSV would be if more people start minting SigUSD


[07/26/2021 7:19 PM] G. de Balboa#0001
yup


[07/26/2021 7:25 PM] G. de Balboa#0001
so just keep an eye out, when the DEX goes live and sigUSD becomes useful, there will be certain points where you should be able to get in on RSV

[08/03/2021 10:06 PM] abchris#8522
You can't mint SigRSV when the reserve ratio is above 800%. This is to avoid diluting the share of current SigRSV holders too much. If this sounds new you may want to read up on SigmaUSD: https://ergonaut.space/en/SigmaUSD

SigmaUSD ....USD value is just that whereas SigmaRSV value is going to fluctuate in terms of USD.  At least when you buy RSV the chart does show your USD value that you own, as well as others.


[08/06/2021 1:06 PM] Mance Pax#5004
So I just checked SigRSV and the reserve is over 4000%.. How is this possible? I thought you cannot mint SigRSV if the reserve is at 800%


[08/06/2021 1:19 PM] glasgowm#9381
You can always withdraw SigUSD since it needs to be stable to $1


[08/06/2021 1:28 PM] Mance Pax#5004
I wanted to withdraw SigRSV for ERG, but I am getting less ERG, even though the price increased about 33% since I bought my RSV


[08/06/2021 2:18 PM] glasgowm#9381
RSV is both a long on erg and the utilisation of the protocol. 50k ERG got minted yesterday but there's been very little utilisation the past few weeks due to the price being stable. 

USD holders withdrew for a profit on the dip - you need to wait for tx fees + unsuccessful traders to build it back up again

Introducing SigmaUSD.io the first UTxO-based stable coin - an instantiation of the AgeUSD protocol. The foundation on which a new era of digital finance will be built.

Its economic model designed in partnership between IOHK, Ergo, and Emurgo maintains the conservative settings for collateral reserves and avoids the need for liquidations. Along with that, it supports a fully decentralised stablecoin emission setup. Thus, SigmaUSD will offer the world a stable, simple, and decentralised stablecoin.

@glasgowm  @Dmitry Usov what do you think about adding an FAQ to sigmausd.io? It seems like the same questions come up a lot. With an FAQ we could point people to common answers (and already have i18n support). I am happy to work on it if you think it‚Äôs a good idea.

yeah, I don't get how I've lost money here - on 7/13 ERG was <$6 meaning I put in 30 ERG, ERG increased 66% in value and now my sigRSV is worth roughly 7% less than it would've been had I not purchased sigRSV

cool thanks. Yeh the stats for sigmausd are acting weird so I thought it may have been somebody trying to query it or something


[08/09/2021 11:17 PM] danandbeard#2312
oh, I had a fundamental misunderstanding, I assumed sigRSV would see more gains than ergo as price goes up - thanks


[08/09/2021 11:18 PM] glasgowm#9381
It's one of the factors. How much is collected in tx fees - shorter profits are also


[08/09/2021 11:18 PM] danandbeard#2312
so what is goin up in that graphics scenario?  I understood it to mean if ergo price double I would get x% more ERG back


[08/09/2021 11:19 PM] danandbeard#2312
now I'm reading that to mean if ergo price doubles sigRSV only goes up 12.5% in relation to USD, whereas I thought that meant I got back 12.5% more ERG


[08/09/2021 11:20 PM] glasgowm#9381
it means in terms of erg - i was quoting for the bottom bit


[08/09/2021 11:21 PM] glasgowm#9381
sigrsv is a long bet on erg and the utilisation of the protocol


[08/09/2021 11:21 PM] danandbeard#2312
then how did ERG price go up 66% and I get back 7% less ERG?  tx fees wouldn't even cover the margin between coming out even, much less the expected profit


[08/09/2021 11:22 PM] danandbeard#2312
at 1100% ratio does that mean sigRSV value has started to go negative?


[08/09/2021 11:22 PM] glasgowm#9381
because you entered when the reserve was full, lots of sigusd has withdrawn and not much has built up in tx fees


[08/09/2021 11:23 PM] glasgowm#9381
? no, it means there's 11x as much RSV as USD


[08/09/2021 11:23 PM] danandbeard#2312
I entered when reserve was at <500% - does that count as "full"


[08/09/2021 11:24 PM] glasgowm#9381
sorry I meant when the bank was full


[08/09/2021 11:24 PM] glasgowm#9381
sigrsv profits off sigusd


[08/09/2021 11:24 PM] glasgowm#9381
and vice-versa


[08/09/2021 11:25 PM] danandbeard#2312
gotcha, so ERG price going up _and_ reserve ratio going down need to happen to ensure profit?


[08/09/2021 11:26 PM] glasgowm#9381
not necessarily, it's a dynamic situation.

Everytime someone mints after you, rsv appreciates with the tx fee.
Everytime someone enters SigUSD and withdraws below their entry (+fee) - rsv depreciates as it needs to cover the value of USD stable to $1
When Erg goes up, they need less erg back for that $ - so RSV goes up


[08/09/2021 11:32 PM] danandbeard#2312
so in my case there's something like 100mm more sigRSV than when I joined so I should see appreciation there

something like 1MM more sigUSD, no idea what that means for that point, but presumably nobody is withdrawing below their fee since price has been going up? presumably little to no depreciation there?

ERG is up 66% so appreciation there

so would you guess I lost money on point 2?


[08/09/2021 11:43 PM] glasgowm#9381
Net amount at any one time doesn't mean much it's the volume. How many people shorted and won

[08/09/2021 11:47 PM] pbr713#9954
So is rsv more for longer hold? Like 1 or 2 years. Price rises slowly and eventually plateaus and more money flows into usd and that would be a good time to withdrawal?


[08/09/2021 11:48 PM] pbr713#9954
Sorry just trying to see how all this works as well. I‚Äôm a holder so I‚Äôm thinking long term


[08/10/2021 12:21 AM] G. de Balboa#0001
the RSV token is basically just liquidity provision. You'll start to see gains in the RSV department when people begin to mint sigUSD for use and erg price appreciates. For now its kinda dead because there is no liquidity machine atm (like a dex) but once ergoDEX and interoperability w other chains get introduced then sigRSV holders benefit from transaction fees(those minting sigUSD from the protocol to use for the dex have to pay tx fees), shorters(those that short the price of erg but fail and now have to buy back the same amount of ERG with more sigUSD), and erg price appreciation


[08/10/2021 7:16 AM] Gazza_SP#5835
Basically we need people using the contract to gain fees from minting and redeeming. At the moment we have lost over 2million sigUSD and since the price crashed from the time it entered, that was a hugely successful short position and they were able to take a lot of the reserves. What we need is for traders to short the reserve now and lose due to a price increase. This will naturally happen again at some point as the contract is utilized with the DEX. But in general long term I think it will even out to similar levels we saw before.


[08/10/2021 3:56 PM] Kiljoy#3695
@kushti as a Sigrsv holder, whats the bear whale situation looking like, should we still be worried and take our profits asap if they are still attacking it? worried to hear there may be a version 3 coming up that would leave current sigRSV holders burnt, any chance you can give us some info?

[08/11/2021 1:57 PM] nitram147#5106
I did not heared anything about the version 3. However if I remember correctly, if you check source code of the current version of the smartcontract for sigmausd bank,  it has builtin functionality to be upgradable. That would mean that even in a case of upgrade all tokens should be still valid (sigmausd, sigmarsv)

I just minted my first sigUSD and am wondering how things will hold up in a real market crash? Let's say crypto goes full bear mode and ERG is back at 10c, there is no way I will be able to redeem my sigUSD for $1 right?


[08/11/2021 9:41 PM] Noro#6370
@Loki ‚öí you can redeem your sigusd anytime. best practice is to keep an eye on the reserve ratio. as long as it is above 100% youll be able to redeem your sigusd for the equivalent of $1


[08/11/2021 10:04 PM] Loki ‚öí#0234
Thanks. So am I right in thinking with things as they currently are (reserve ratio around 1000%) if the price dropped over 90% to $1.20 things would start to get dicey? Obviously this exact scenario is unlikely to happen as people enter and exit but I'm just trying to understand at what point things break.


[08/11/2021 10:23 PM] glasgowm#9381
As the reserve ratio lowers the incentive mint RSV increases (as well as the incentive to withdraw SigUSD)

If everything dropped to 0 and stayed like that, once it's below 100% RR you get a fair share of what's left

Or just the asset and transaction fee

not that I'm aware of, yeah asset + txn fee will be automatic as well as protocol should auto deduct the 2.25% fee entering and exiting.

but first I want to understand it


[08/22/2021 7:45 PM] LeggoMyErgo#4477
Yeah, understand it first before buying more haha. It's more of an option on reserves, of which price and ratio will effect when people hop in and out and with more adoption more fees ideally will be added to reserves.


[08/22/2021 7:46 PM] LeggoMyErgo#4477
I bought early too and still no where near profit or break even, but as sigmaUSD utilized for stablecoin and not shorting should be okay....when is the question


[08/22/2021 8:21 PM] Mance Pax#5004
You can't buy more RSV now, the reserve is over 800%


[08/24/2021 7:57 AM] DrShunts#4832
Just reading the bearwhale article. It would seem to me a key issue in the use of oracles for trading in/out of sigmaUSD is the discrete nature of oracle updates vs the continuous nature of ERG/USD price and the ability to trade sigUSD, SIGRSV continuously. Has anyone thought about aligning the timing to trade SigUSD, SIGRSV with the epoch boundaries by using an auction that is solved at the epoch boundary as the oracle price updates?

If every time this bearwhale entered SigUSD and the community need to come together just to defeat it. It already shows that there is something wrong / need to improve in the protocol.


[08/24/2021 4:11 PM] glasgowm#9381
The announcement is just so people are aware and can exit RSV when possible


[08/25/2021 10:08 PM] cliddell#9456
Revisiting this since it‚Äôs now been 3 months and the V1 SigUSD supply hasn‚Äôt changed. Is there any way the V1 reserve ratio could be lowered so that more individuals who are still stuck with V1 SigRSV could pull out? It seems that if the price was able to be locked, there should be a way of lowering it as well.


[08/25/2021 10:40 PM] abchris#8522
I think the price was "locked" by shutting down the oracle pool. The reserve ratio is a parameter of the contract itself, which cannot be modified.

[08/26/2021 12:23 AM] abchris#8522
The contract is just a contract, it will keep working as long as Ergo transactions are mined. The oracle pool could be reactivated, that would free up some rsv with ERG's current price, at the expense of whoever still has SigUSD in there...

im bull af on erg wanna provide some RSV, but more worried from the protocol side


[09/04/2021 4:03 PM] G. de Balboa#0001
is providing rsv on the dex same as providing it on sigUSD.io (i.e do they use the same pool?)


[09/04/2021 9:33 PM] bk#4411
Nope.  On sigmausd.io you are minting/redeeming token through the sigmausd smart contract.  But on ErgoDex you are trading around already minted tokens.  So all the token in the dex pools were originally created through the sigmausd contract and the dex does not interact with the sigmausd contract at all.  That is why it is much cheaper to trade sigmausd token on the dex than on sigmausd.io.  You aren't paying the minting/redeeming fees.


[09/04/2021 9:43 PM] G. de Balboa#0001
Ahh that makes sense, so having your sigRSV in sigmausd.io is better than on the dex? Since the tokens that the dex uses comes FROM sigusd smart contract


[09/04/2021 10:08 PM] bk#4411
I don't know that one is necessarily better than the other.


[09/04/2021 10:09 PM] G. de Balboa#0001
been tryna figure that out myself haha. I'll think about it some more. Thanks!


[09/05/2021 1:38 AM] $aX#5658
You don't really have your sigRSV in sigmausd.io. You actually own them as an asset and can do what you wish with those on whichever platform you choose that accepts those


[09/05/2021 1:45 AM] G. de Balboa#0001
I don't know why I never considered it like this. I always imagined the RSV was locked up in the sigmausd.io contract. So I can redeem ergs for my RSV on the dex, and potentially get a sweeter deal(if the dex is being used more) than on sigmausd.io?


[09/05/2021 11:56 AM] Zeiezee#0876
if sigRSV can be use in the DEX, does that affect the reserve ratio?


[09/05/2021 11:56 AM] Zeiezee#0876

I watched the ergo summit explanation of how sigusd protocol works and he said that once the reserve ratio is met then no more sigusd can be minted. How does this protocol scale to 100 billion + if the amount of sigusd is capped?

At this point he says if the reserve coin ratio is to low, then buying stable coins is forbidden. My question is how is this scalable then?

[09/18/2021 8:21 PM] texas_miner#9831
Im just trying to understand, im not extremely technical but have enough computer competence to build a rig and point it to a pool


[09/18/2021 8:49 PM] texas_miner#9831
Im trying to understand this bc if sigusd can peg the value of your dollar holding to the us dollar without an underlying cbp to back ur digital usd token, I plan on launching a campaign to educate people on how to take their fist dollars out of the central banking system and into this digital dollar. Essentially taking power from the central governments and pushing the power to the edges where the people have control. 
#To do this, I‚Äôm trying to understand if Sigusd can:
1.)be a place for the gen pop with no interest in crypto to hold their fiat dollars in sigusd and not worry about the price of any crypto. Erg, btc none of it. Maybe sigusd fluctuates in value +-1%(like usdt). Is this possible?


[09/18/2021 8:51 PM] texas_miner#9831
As a us vet, Im so damn pissed of rn  at how we lost Afghanistan and whats going on over there. I feel the us has been under siege since the election and their is nothing I can do about it


[09/18/2021 8:54 PM] texas_miner#9831
Until I had this epiphany, I‚Äôm a damn good marketer. I want to lead a campaign where people who feel like me can take action and move their fiat to sigusd. Fix the money fix the world.  Eventually i‚Äôll market to businesses on how to implement payment processing programs to their POS.


[09/18/2021 8:54 PM] texas_miner#9831
But first I gotta have a better understanding of the risks of holding sigusd


[09/18/2021 8:58 PM] texas_miner#9831
Reading the bear whale article in your  pinned message now


[09/18/2021 9:06 PM] glasgowm#9381
Same answer as last time

no more can be minted until the ratio drops again. You can also use SigUSD infinite times after minting.


[09/18/2021 9:07 PM] glasgowm#9381
sigUSD will keep it's peg while the reserve ratio is above 100%. Below that sigUSD holders get a fair share of what's left.


[09/18/2021 9:08 PM] glasgowm#9381
But as the reserve ratio drops the incentive to mint RSV and withdraw sigusd increases.


[09/18/2021 9:23 PM] texas_miner#9831
Ok the first part clicked. No more minting sigusd does not mean the users of the network will no longer have access to sigusd. They‚Äôll still be able to trade sigusd for whatever pairs on exchanges

[09/19/2021 4:37 AM] abashai#9101
I understood the sigUSD part, but why am I unable to redeem my RSV right now? I thought I could do that at anytime. I was providing liquidity.


[09/19/2021 4:44 AM] abashai#9101
I don't really understand it but I see I need the Reserve to be above 400%. Is there a good way for me to know when that is w/o looking at the Web page? It would be cool if the site showed a history of the ratio/reserves. Any idea when the ratio will go up? I need some of my funds lol. I did not fully understand the operation beforehand. Thanks.


[09/19/2021 8:39 AM] Huginn#2291
Hi, I believe you are looking for history which you can find in the top right corner under settings, the link directs you to https://bdkent.github.io/sigmausd-history/ and the ratio depends on minting SigUSD, SigRSV and price of ERG itself I believe

[09/19/2021 2:19 PM] abashai#9101
Thank you. At this time, sigUSD or the redemption of RSV cannot be done.  That is what is confusing. What will trigger the redemption of RSV?


[09/19/2021 2:21 PM] Huginn#2291
If the price of ERG goes up (and nothing else happens) or if somebody mints SigRSV to increase reserve ratio


[09/19/2021 2:28 PM] abashai#9101
Ok, someone else minting RSV makes sense. But being able to redeem if the price goes up does not. In any case, I appreciate your response. I would really appreciate it if you could mint some RSV for me üòÇ have a great day Huggin.


[09/19/2021 2:38 PM] Huginn#2291
well if the price goes up then you "need less" ERG to cover minted SigUSD so the reserve ratio should go up i believe. I already have some SigRSV yes. Happy I was helpful a little!


[09/20/2021 6:22 AM] misosoup#3130

Certainly not the worst time to mint tbh, ERG-SigRSV ratio is pretty nice and you would also help to increase reserve ratio but obv not a financial advice.

9.2k erg sent to that account 12.04.2020 from the mixer which has then made continous small tx (5-20 erg) to sigmausd starting 01.09.2021


[09/22/2021 9:20 AM] texas_miner#9831
So we have all these different tokens in regards to the sigusd protocol. Once we have ergo dex will this creat secondary markets to buy/sell sigusd, RSV so the market can transfer risk around regardless status of the sigusd protocol?


[09/22/2021 10:03 AM] glasgowm#9381
yes you can already trade Sigma on ergodex

I don't imagine anything that simple/automated exists on erg/ada (yet). In it's most basic form it's just a simple smart contract that allows changes verified by a NFT afaik. Sigmausd has this implemented currently and has a governance split between trusted community members

If you convert erg to sigusd do you risk something? Can sigusd suddenly not be pegged to a dollar due to bearwhale manipulation or smth? Just want to understand if there are any risks doing that


[10/03/2021 4:08 PM] glasgowm#9381
Can always redeem - only risk is if RR drops below 100% then everyone gets a fair share.


[10/03/2021 4:13 PM] vegycslol#1714
And what is that risk? Eg if i have 1k$ and rr drops to 50% do i lose 500$ if i want to immediately convert to erg? Or can i wait for rr to get above 100% and then still have my 1k$?


[10/03/2021 4:19 PM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
There's no timer to redeem.


[10/03/2021 4:20 PM] glasgowm#9381
You could wait for it to recover I'm pretty sure - especially since SigRSV are locked in below 400 RR. Unlikely to ever get there though as the incentive to mint RSV and withdraw USD increases as the RR decreases.


[10/03/2021 4:21 PM] ziggomatic#9335
there is no incentive to use sigrsv so long as the bearwhale exists

Its main use case - stability. You can use a covert address in the mixer and set it to cash out mixed SigUSD. Be your own bank. It's also available via Cryptocurrency Checkout for websites to integrate (most platforms supported). Being added to #auction-house, possiblyy #ergoraffle and there's a ERG/SigUSD pair on the dex.

One single wallet controls more than 50% of the sigUSD supply, thus, he also control the reserve ratio. It means that people can mint or reedem only when he wants to.

As the time goes by and people don't use the system, the whale takes more control over it. Who is willing to mint something there, right now? What will change this scenario? If people don't start to use it, it may not have a bright future as devs and the team say.

well, the BearWhale has been around since the first version of ageUSD and the protocol (even though we're on V2) is working as intended. This seems like its an issue for you and I love that youre invested in the longevity of sigUSD so i would ask you, How much is it worth to you? the best you and I can do right now would be to mint some sigUSD and provide it as liquidity on ergoDex to give the community the ability to participate

[10/03/2021 8:44 PM] Noro#6370
if the issue is that the BW has all the sigUSD when the market turns over and no one in the community can mint, then our solution is to provide liquidity on the dex


[10/03/2021 8:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
I never used the Dex, how about the rewards?


[10/03/2021 8:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don't know if its a good idea right now, unless the rewards are very good. Serious impermanent loss risk.


[10/03/2021 8:49 PM] Noro#6370
.5% on every swap


[10/03/2021 9:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
So it's probably a low reward, high risk move. ERG's price is completely unpredictable at this moment.

here is my anecdotal experience with sigrsv. i entered at roughly 370% $6.6, at the time the exchange rate wasn't on the sigmausd page, but i figure that was at about 1erg = 750-ish. over the coming months i could not break even, even when erg was $18/$19, as the rsv/erg exchange rate was reset time after time by the bearwhale. i exited at a loss today, i consider it a learning experience, but it still stings.


[10/03/2021 9:13 PM] Noro#6370
imo the problem isnt the BW


[10/03/2021 9:13 PM] Noro#6370
the long term problem is that its incredibly difficult to be profitable on the RSV side


[10/03/2021 9:14 PM] ziggomatic#9335
quite likely

you also have to consider that that's only partial bearwhale bag. he goes in 100% each and every time. no-one has balls that big. his game bag is accumulating, and if he gets in the shit he could bail himself out with the rest of his stash


[10/03/2021 9:16 PM] Noro#6370
the BW is just a player in the game. im talking about an issue with the rules of the game

[10/03/2021 9:17 PM] ziggomatic#9335
precisely


[10/03/2021 9:21 PM] Noro#6370
the bigger problem is that if historically you lose value by holding RSV then why would anyone fund the protocol


[10/03/2021 9:21 PM] Noro#6370
this is how it loses adoption, who cares what the BW does now that ergs volume is up


[10/03/2021 9:21 PM] Noro#6370
the 'game' is tipped towards the shorts


[10/03/2021 9:24 PM] Noro#6370
i suspect where this should balance out would be having an avg roi for sigUSD being around -2% and avg roi for sigRSV being +2% (or somewhat close to tracking the inflation rate of usd). you could also make the argument that that would only happen at scale


[10/03/2021 9:26 PM] ziggomatic#9335

Was the first peak the first spike to $18? Iirc around a week or two after btc hit 64k


[10/03/2021 9:58 PM] Noro#6370
My concern is when we (erg) had its most recent trip to $18 it was hardly reflected in the tab price, seen above. It‚Äôs too early to tell but it‚Äôs looking like a down trend


[10/03/2021 9:59 PM] Noro#6370

[10/03/2021 10:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
That's because the reserves were depleted during the price rise. Doesn't matter if it goes 1x or 100x if there's no value to take from

Interesting


[10/03/2021 10:02 PM] glasgowm#9381
over-time more people will either get trapped or just use SigUSD for actual stability / LP. BW was the only player back then so when he withdrew, SigRSV couldn't make profits until someone else deposited - and have the price go up again


[10/03/2021 10:03 PM] ziggomatic#9335
they kinda are still the only player now too


[10/03/2021 10:04 PM] glasgowm#9381
There's still 7x more in the SigUSD bank atm


[10/03/2021 10:05 PM] glasgowm#9381
so more value to take from during rises, that capital seemed to stay in last price rise too


[10/03/2021 10:06 PM] Noro#6370
jsut so i know im following what youre saying, do you mean 7x value in the reserve compared to issued sigUSD?


[10/03/2021 10:06 PM] glasgowm#9381
compared to last time when there was only 250k Circ. SigUSD

if i want to swap 10 erg for sigusd the conversion is 12.57, however if i want to swap 1000 erg the conversion is 8.6 --> is that because of low liquidity in the pool?


[10/03/2021 10:09 PM] Noro#6370
a bounce off our all time low


[10/03/2021 10:09 PM] ziggomatic#9335
so about 0.0012


[10/03/2021 10:10 PM] Noro#6370
every RSV holder should be looking at that chart and asking, why am I funding a stable coin when my value relative to erg is consistently diminishing


[10/03/2021 10:10 PM] Noro#6370
I dont mean to bash, erg is my favorite project


[10/03/2021 10:10 PM] ziggomatic#9335

[10/03/2021 10:13 PM] glasgowm#9381
There was 2m in when you minted. Price dipped to 5$, and most sigusd was withdrawn end of July. Wasn't a decent amount in until just under $12. RSV has then had a few mini spikes in value on it's way upto $18 as it recovers but not enough to make up for funds lost before price crashes again.


[10/03/2021 10:14 PM] Noro#6370
yes


[10/03/2021 10:15 PM] glasgowm#9381
It's a zero-sum game, SigUSD has been more profitable because BTC crashed on us as shortly after we peaked. If we see some growth SigRSV should have the advantage and trap loads of shorters on the way


[10/03/2021 10:17 PM] ziggomatic#9335
if sigusd can be redeemed at any time they're not really trapped in the same way sigrsv is tho right


[10/03/2021 10:17 PM] Noro#6370
correct


[10/03/2021 10:18 PM] glasgowm#9381
trapped profit-wise, especially if they let it go another few $ on the expectation it'll crash


[10/03/2021 10:18 PM] glasgowm#9381
like BW did originally


[10/03/2021 10:18 PM] Noro#6370
I think the issue is that it is unclear what the specific set of circumstances need to happen to be profitable holding rsv, bc just having the price of Erg go up is not enough on its own


[10/03/2021 10:19 PM] Noro#6370
and how often do those set of circumstances happen


[10/03/2021 10:19 PM] glasgowm#9381
You need shorters to loose more than they win


[10/03/2021 10:20 PM] glasgowm#9381
SigRSV is rewarded for the risk associated with maintaining stability. But there's still risk - just depends on the market dynamics and who's in and who's up or down.


[10/03/2021 10:20 PM] Noro#6370
agreed


[10/03/2021 10:20 PM] Noro#6370
but what set of market dynamics


[10/03/2021 10:21 PM] glasgowm#9381
Shorters to loose more than they win. So SigUSD withdrawing at a higher price than they entered (or staying in completely)


[10/03/2021 10:22 PM] Noro#6370
gotcha


[10/03/2021 10:24 PM] Noro#6370
given that the shorts can redeem at anytime I do not know how it would be profitable for RSV long term


[10/03/2021 10:25 PM] Noro#6370
(im not suggesting that should be taken away btw)


[10/03/2021 10:25 PM] ziggomatic#9335
how is the rsv price calculated?

[10/03/2021 10:28 PM] Noro#6370
the overlay is the price of erg over RSV/ERG


[10/03/2021 10:29 PM] Noro#6370
even after the most recent momentum of erg the price of rsv barely kept pace


[10/03/2021 10:29 PM] Noro#6370
(yes the profitability of RSV is not based on erg price alone)


[10/03/2021 10:30 PM] Noro#6370
I think we can safely say that the shorts are good at not losing at this game


[10/03/2021 10:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
well it's a short and the price went down so yes. But has only been running a few months.


[10/03/2021 10:31 PM] Noro#6370
they keep the RR close to 400% because anything under is the sweet spot for them


[10/03/2021 10:31 PM] Noro#6370
it locks the rsv players in


[10/03/2021 10:32 PM] ziggomatic#9335
yeah that's pretty much why i got out at a loss today. fuck that noise :p


[10/03/2021 10:32 PM] Noro#6370
we (rsv holders) had an entire upswing from July almost everyone was down erg


[10/03/2021 10:32 PM] ziggomatic#9335
fed up of being trapped


[10/03/2021 10:32 PM] Noro#6370
its a game theory issue


[10/03/2021 10:33 PM] glasgowm#9381
The upswing doesn't help if there's no USD. Need that built up first with smaller buyers over time.


[10/03/2021 10:33 PM] Noro#6370
gotcha


[10/03/2021 10:33 PM] ziggomatic#9335
and even tho usd went from 3mil to 6mil i could never break even.


[10/03/2021 10:34 PM] ziggomatic#9335
my small brain can't handle the game


[10/03/2021 10:34 PM] glasgowm#9381
because the price went down when they were in


[10/03/2021 10:35 PM] Noro#6370
and they have enough $$ to kick the RR down past 400% to lock the bulls out


[10/03/2021 10:35 PM] ziggomatic#9335
yeh from 6 to 4 usd


[10/03/2021 10:35 PM] glasgowm#9381
just imagine 2 sides betting on the price, winner takes their share of the pot


[10/03/2021 10:37 PM] glasgowm#9381
if price dumps and someone takes most the pot - even if it rises you're not betting against anyone anymore and need to wait until more USD/Shorters bet and loose


[10/03/2021 10:37 PM] Noro#6370
what happens if we remove the under 400% lock out for the RSV side?


[10/03/2021 10:37 PM] glasgowm#9381
You risk the stability


[10/03/2021 10:37 PM] glasgowm#9381
and SigUSD could loose it's peg a lot easier


[10/03/2021 10:38 PM] Noro#6370
but we trust market forces already to keep it over 100%


[10/03/2021 10:38 PM] Noro#6370
I mean this as more of a thought experiment


[10/03/2021 10:39 PM] Noro#6370
I would also argue that if everyone who holds RSV consistently loses value by holding it, then they would be incentivized to sell. risking stability of the protocol


[10/03/2021 10:39 PM] glasgowm#9381
Trust is a strong word - they're incentivised but maintaing the peg is kinda a biggie for a stablecoin. Could be a valid SIP though potentially


[10/03/2021 10:40 PM] Noro#6370
look im spitballing here because this is a complex problem, that has no easy answer, and i want to see it work


[10/03/2021 10:41 PM] Noro#6370
thats a fair point, maintaining the peg is priority


[10/03/2021 10:41 PM] Vern_Macelli#0223
Noob on this thread--so sorry if discussed already--but wouldn't it make more sense if, instead of having a hard floor (400%) and ceiling (800%), there was instead some sort of phase-in and phase-out. Probably multiple ways it could be accomplished but for example, the protocol could only allow a certain percentage of a user's RSV  to be cashed out when the reserve is below 400% (with the percentage growing to 100% once it reaches over 400%).


[10/03/2021 10:42 PM] Noro#6370

what do ya mean


[10/03/2021 10:47 PM] ziggomatic#9335
well their goal is to accumulate as much erg as possible


[10/03/2021 10:47 PM] Noro#6370
correct


[10/03/2021 10:47 PM] Noro#6370
and the BW can best do that shorting it


[10/03/2021 10:48 PM] ziggomatic#9335
yup


[10/03/2021 10:48 PM] Noro#6370
which means when the BW looks at this game, the profitable side is SigUSD and not SIGRSV


[10/03/2021 10:49 PM] Noro#6370
if SigRSV was the more profitable side of this game, the BW would buy a ton of RSV and then go on the exchanges and jack the price way up


[10/03/2021 10:50 PM] ziggomatic#9335
some time ago when i first started looking at crypto, i noticed a trend, even on a high cap coin like ADA. the masses would pummel themselves against a brickwall of ada/btc, lose steam, and the price would fall to a level


[10/03/2021 10:51 PM] ziggomatic#9335
this can be seen with erg too obviously since it's about 1/100th the market cap


[10/03/2021 10:52 PM] Noro#6370
I actually think we should drastically increase the fee to change sigUSD to erg. That scenario would usually happen when there is a quick rise in the price of erg and when the RR is below 400%


[10/03/2021 10:53 PM] Noro#6370
rsv holders would love it since it brings more erg to the reserves


[10/04/2021 2:42 AM] G. de Balboa#0001
I guess for now shorters will win but not for long


[10/04/2021 5:43 AM] glasgowm#9381
He has bought a ton of RSV a few times, depends what way the price is going.


[10/04/2021 4:07 PM] glasgowm#9381

Will Ergo stablecoin be used in any way on Cardano? I was dissapoojted to hear Cardana had it‚Äôs own DJED

What now is primary purpose of Ergo stablecoin?


[10/05/2021 4:48 AM] WarriorKing#1784
I may have been the second public person on earth to purchase SigmaRSV

I purchased 1,000,000 SigmaRSV for 1,320 ERGs when I believe the price of ERG was about $2.50 or maybe less

I understood that I was taking risk to provide stability for others who wanted security 

That in the scenario ERGs went up in value - I would be rewarded 

Now after a 500% increase in price of ERGs my 1,000,000 SigmaRSV is only worth 1,025 ERGs

So even though ERG price increased dramatically somehow SigmaUSD holders ended up with 300 of my ERG‚Äôs and I lost 300 of my ERGs 

I tried to study all the materials very closely to understand the mechanism and make an informed investment - 

I am very confused how after about 9 months or more of providing liquidity and dramatic increase in ERG price that my SigRSV lost 25% of its value

Can anyone who understands this - help provide me some insight?


[10/05/2021 5:32 AM] Zeiezee#0876
i dont know the specifics but you can swap it in ergodex, ergodex is 1ERG to 900+ RSV


[10/05/2021 5:32 AM] Zeiezee#0876
so there should be some profit


[10/05/2021 5:32 AM] Zeiezee#0876
and depending how much was RSV back then


[10/05/2021 5:33 AM] Zeiezee#0876
oh looks like still missing mmm


[10/05/2021 7:27 AM] glasgowm#9381
You would've been in serious profit if you'd withdrawn when ERG was up initially. There's been too many dips and too many successful shorters for you to be in profit right now.


[10/05/2021 7:30 AM] glasgowm#9381
You could've withdrawn 1454 ERG on 19/5 - a 42% profit

[10/05/2021 8:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
but there is a way to check it? instead of asuming it worked as intended


[10/05/2021 8:42 AM] abchris#8522
Sure, you can parse the blockchain. Done for you on https://ergo.watch/sigmausd, look at the 30d history oracle price.

He had 1320 erg, so profit would be around 10%


[10/05/2021 9:15 AM] glasgowm#9381
Ah right, I mulitpled the wrong one then. 42% was the increase in RSV price (roughly). So they'd have 1874.4 erg


[10/05/2021 9:18 AM] glasgowm#9381
depending on when he minted, if he got in at $2.40sh at the start as his message seems to indicate it would've been +~70%


[10/05/2021 9:19 AM] glasgowm#9381
If he withdrew on the RSV peak 19, May.


[10/07/2021 4:02 AM] misosoup#3130
what portion of ERG is recommended to put into sigmaRSV?


[10/07/2021 5:34 AM] BrothaChad#0168
hello


[10/07/2021 5:34 AM] BrothaChad#0168
i have a question


[10/07/2021 5:34 AM] BrothaChad#0168
don't get me wrong, i love ergo, but sigrsv seems to be the worst investment i've ever made. back in may i exchanged 148 erg for 100,000 sigrsv. i should be rewarded for providing liquidity except the reverse happened. even when erg pumped to $18 i would still only get 120 erg for my sigrsv. at current prices i only get 100 erg. could someone explain?

@Deleted User @Noro @ziggomatic  

Remember this is the early days, the protocol freezing ur ability to mint certain coins is only a limitation in the current market conditions. Eventually you‚Äôll be able to trade all coins involved in the sigusd protocol for btc/eth/ada hell even maybe some other stable coins once they are listed on the Dex & centralized exchanges. 

Also, when trying to see how the sig usd protocol works. Dont test large amounts relative to your account size. Risk 1% of account size max to play around. 



Regarding djed. They are pretty far behind ergo in forms of development. Remember this is an open source world, look alike and copies of coins/protocols should be expected.  They just have their suites on so to speak and have for legal headway. However they do not operate in the US. Its a safe move by Charles to call ‚Äúdjed‚Äù atm. Imo I kinda prefer it that way. We wanna keep the sigusd protocol on the hush hush to avoid regulation from uncle sam,killin the program before its made real headway.  

Remember a digital dollar with no CDP, allowing pure p2p xfer without behing held in their banking system is a nightmare for them. 

They have somewhat control over btc bc of its transparency. (Tie a address to a social security via kyc and its their heaven). But with ergo mixer creating ultimate privacy, essentially digital ‚Äúcash‚Äù thats scary scary. 

It starts slow and steady then all at once.


[10/07/2021 5:02 PM] misosoup#3130
what ratio is sigrsv typically supposed to bounce between?


[10/07/2021 5:03 PM] misosoup#3130
or is it possible for it to keep going up above 1000 RSV per ERG and rarely come back down

It can keep going higher if more rsv is minted and shorters manage to gain erg through sigusd


[10/10/2021 7:16 AM] BrothaChad#0168
when i convert my erg to sigusd, what happens to that erg? does it go straight to the reserve?

I have a couple of questions as I'm creating a ageusd eli5 youtube video


[10/10/2021 7:54 AM] BrothaChad#0168
it would be amazing if u could help me understand some concepts which i can then share with my audience. here, i understand that the 400% reserve ratio essentially serves as a floor since user cannot redeem sigrsv below 400% and also cannot mint sigusd, so what explains the slight dips below 400%? is this due to lag whereby minting sigusd/redeeming rsv transactions still take place right before the protocol updates to realize that the reserve ratio is below 400%?

[10/10/2021 8:01 AM] BrothaChad#0168
or... let's say the rr is 401%, then a user holding a massive amount of sigrsv redeems it, it would push it below 400% given the amount. is this also the case


[10/10/2021 8:01 AM] abchris#8522
Reserve ratio (RR) can drop below 400% when the value of ERG drops.


[10/10/2021 8:02 AM] abchris#8522
No, that can‚Äôt happen as the contract determines the max amount of sigrsv that is redeemable (to satisfy the rr 400 constraint)


[10/10/2021 8:06 AM] abchris#8522
Nice to hear you‚Äôre working on a vid.


[10/10/2021 8:11 AM] BrothaChad#0168

[10/10/2021 8:11 AM] BrothaChad#0168
couple more questions if u may


[10/10/2021 8:14 AM] BrothaChad#0168
I was scrolling through the past messages and saw glasgow said 'But as the reserve ratio drops the incentive to mint RSV and withdraw sigusd increases.' is this true assuming the price of ERG is stable?


[10/10/2021 8:17 AM] BrothaChad#0168
cause a stable erg price with a declining rr would suggest the rsv is undervalued


[10/10/2021 8:20 AM] abchris#8522
Yes it is. Assuming constant erg price, if you buy sigrsv at rr 400, that alone will increase (slighlty) the value of sigrsv (because of the fees added to the reserve). Say now others do the same till rr hits 800, they‚Äôll all be paying slightly more.


[10/10/2021 8:21 AM] abchris#8522
If erg price is constant, declining rr is caused by redeemed rsv and/or minted sigusd


[10/10/2021 8:22 AM] BrothaChad#0168
top, making it much clearer for me g


[10/10/2021 8:22 AM] abchris#8522
But, irl, erg price isn‚Äôt fixed:) so what you‚Äôre seeing is that a declining rr is more often caused by a drop in erg value


[10/10/2021 8:23 AM] BrothaChad#0168
yeah yeah, but that is super helpful to understand


[10/10/2021 8:23 AM] BrothaChad#0168
cause it makes it easier to explain


[10/10/2021 8:23 AM] abchris#8522
So, dropping rr is a proxy for dropping erg value and thus sigrsv value, which means more incentive to buy some


[10/10/2021 8:24 AM] BrothaChad#0168
now i just gotta wrap my head around equity + liabilities but that seems quite simple since it's based on reserves and usd circulating. just gotta look at central bank balance shset.


[10/10/2021 8:24 AM] abchris#8522

here is my last concern for now


[10/10/2021 8:34 AM] BrothaChad#0168
what's the reason for the huge dip in circ. USD here? was this the BW? this caused the rr to boom. what incentives are there for people to reduce the rr by minting sigusd or redeeming sigrsv? or is a rr at 4k% ok (thus incentives aren't needed)?

[10/10/2021 8:38 AM] abchris#8522
Obviously a whale, bear or not, don‚Äôt remember. The main goal is to ensure sigusd holders can always redeem their value. In cases like this the rr will jump. Not an issue per se, the contract is happy as that means plenty of room for anyone to mint stables.


[10/10/2021 8:38 AM] BrothaChad#0168
incentive to buy some assuming one thinks the price of erg will go up, correct?


[10/10/2021 8:39 AM] BrothaChad#0168

[10/10/2021 8:45 AM] BrothaChad#0168
i might drop in a couple more questions if they come up


[10/10/2021 8:46 AM] abchris#8522
No worries, took us all some time to wrap or head around it ; )


[10/10/2021 8:56 AM] BrothaChad#0168
so all fees are converted into sigRSV and act as reserve?


[10/10/2021 9:01 AM] abchris#8522
All fees go to reserve, in erg. The reserve is just a bag of erg, part of the bag belongs to sigusd holders, the other part to sigrsv holders. The fees go to sigrsv side of the bag. Of course as erg price changes the ‚Äúboundary‚Äù between both sides can shift


[10/10/2021 9:04 AM] BrothaChad#0168
so the erg that comes in as tx fees is part of the sigrsv reserve. then people buying sigrsv can mint this new sigrsv or does it not circulate?


[10/10/2021 9:10 AM] abchris#8522
So the reserve is just a big erg bag. Part of it is needed to cover the value of circulating sigusd, that‚Äôs the liabilities. Whatever remains is the equity. The value of sigrsv is equity divided by circulating SigRSV. When you have a tx, the fees just go to the reserves. Because this is instantaneous, the price of erg hasn‚Äôt changed, so liabilities haven‚Äôt changed and so the extra erg form the fees leads to increased equity and hence increased sigrsv value.


[10/10/2021 9:12 AM] abchris#8522
In the reserve, there is no explicit difference between erg from sigusd minting or rsv minting or from tx fees.


[10/10/2021 9:17 AM] BrothaChad#0168
hmm ok


[10/10/2021 9:22 AM] BrothaChad#0168
so what drives the price of sigrsv up is: 1) increasing erg value and 2) increasing equity (higher rr) assuming circ. sig RSV increases at a slower rate than the equity.


[10/10/2021 9:27 AM] abchris#8522
Yeah, it‚Äôs all about the equity. When you own sigrsv, you own a portion of the equity. Equity will grow with: tx fees and rising erg price. Equity shrinks with dropping erg price, impermanently if nobody redeema sigusd, but if a sigusd holder redeems at a lower erg price than he bought, that‚Äôs a permanent chunk of the reserve (and the equity) that‚Äôs leaving the contract.


[10/10/2021 9:28 AM] abchris#8522
Circ rsv increases at a lower rate than equity because of the tx fees


[10/10/2021 9:29 AM] BrothaChad#0168
ok, thanks man, this is a lot to take in XD


[10/10/2021 9:30 AM] BrothaChad#0168
i might have to make 2 videos


[10/10/2021 9:30 AM] BrothaChad#0168

[10/10/2021 9:33 AM] abchris#8522
I‚Äôd say take your time and nail it in one. The beginner version might end up misleading.


[10/10/2021 9:33 AM] abchris#8522
Think you need some simple schematic representing liabilities and equity and how the change with txs and erg price


[10/10/2021 9:34 AM] BrothaChad#0168
yeh will see what i can do


[10/10/2021 9:35 AM] abchris#8522
Like a rectangle representing 4000 erg. 1000 is liabs, 3000 is equity. That‚Äôs when rr is at 400. Then go from there


[10/10/2021 9:37 AM] BrothaChad#0168
wouldnt rr be at 400 when 1000 is liabs and 4000 is equity


[10/10/2021 9:38 AM] abchris#8522
Rr is reserves over liabs, not equity over liabs üòâ

[10/10/2021 10:22 PM] abchris#8522
Never looked into how a central bank worked, tbh, but listing tx fees as liabilities is confusing imo. And you can't just tie them to sigrsv. There is only one reserve, which the tx fall into, now imagine the rr drops to 100%, then all the reserve is claimable by sigusd holders, including whatever amount of fees were accumulated in the reserve.


[10/10/2021 10:48 PM] misosoup#3130
is it possible to fight the bear whale if someone has enough ERG?


[10/11/2021 2:34 AM] abchris#8522
Somewhat yes, by "taking his place". If you read through the bearwhale saga, there was a "good whale" that did exactly that. So if you have loads of ERG, you can mint a good chunk of sigmausd so that the rr gets close to 400. That would prevent the bearwhale to jump in.


[10/11/2021 3:41 AM] BrothaChad#0168
i agree. So, let's say hypothetically the current price of ERG is $10. The rr is at 400% and everyone is scared to provide reserves for whatever reason. Then, assuming no one provides reserves and people don't redeem sigUSD, the price of erg would need to drop to near to $2.5 for rr to hit 100%.


[10/11/2021 3:43 AM] BrothaChad#0168
actually, i think im wrong here. let me rethink this.


[10/11/2021 3:47 AM] abchris#8522
If rr is at 400, you need erg to lose 75% of its dollar value to reach rr of 100. So say from $10 to $2.5.


[10/11/2021 3:47 AM] BrothaChad#0168
yes exactly what i was editing


[10/11/2021 3:48 AM] BrothaChad#0168
that is worst case


[10/11/2021 3:49 AM] BrothaChad#0168
and what mechanism prevents going below 100%?


[10/11/2021 3:51 AM] BrothaChad#0168
at the point of hitting 100% shouldn't all reserves remaining (=circ. sigUSD) be redeemed for ERG or reserves?


[10/11/2021 3:52 AM] BrothaChad#0168
one other thing I was trying to grasp was this. price went up but reserve value did not keep up. still unsure üò¶

[10/11/2021 4:20 AM] abchris#8522
None other than the increasing incentive to mint sigrsv


[10/11/2021 4:28 AM] abchris#8522
Looking at the 90d history, I see equity remaining relatively flat. Sigusd shorting successfully and redeeming will permanently lower the sigrsv value (less erg in the reserves). You‚Äôd need the reverse to happen or a lot of tx fees to reverse that.


[10/11/2021 4:28 AM] BrothaChad#0168
and, again, to confirm, this incentive to mint sigrsv is based on the premise people think the price will go back up?


[10/11/2021 4:29 AM] BrothaChad#0168
amazing bro, you're so helpful. this video gonna be thanks to ur help.


[10/11/2021 4:30 AM] abchris#8522
Well on the premise that sigrsv will go back up, which linked to the erg price in some way, bit not a 1:1 relationship as you pointed out.


[10/11/2021 4:33 AM] abchris#8522
Also, that increase in erg value in august happened when the rr was way high, like in the 4000 and then 1000%. Thing with rr is that the higher it is, the less erg price has an impact on sigrsv value, so that explains it too.


[10/11/2021 4:33 AM] BrothaChad#0168
i think that is a fair premise. as long as erg continues to develop great tech, there is no reason for individuals to think that prices will keep dropping unless there is a mass market crash.


[10/11/2021 4:34 AM] BrothaChad#0168
ok thanks


[10/11/2021 4:34 AM] Noro#6370
You‚Äôre correct, deeper pockets jump into RSV when there‚Äôs a quick price rise, and that dilutes potential gains when holding RSV


[10/11/2021 4:36 AM] Noro#6370
I want to see erg succeed but my hunch is that the trend for RSV/ERG is downward over time


[10/11/2021 4:37 AM] BrothaChad#0168
let's see, tbh the protocol is still v new


[10/11/2021 4:37 AM] Noro#6370
It‚Äôs been out 6 months


[10/11/2021 4:37 AM] Noro#6370
With two price spikes, imo we have enough data


[10/11/2021 4:39 AM] abchris#8522
It needs more usage, we‚Äôll see how things go with arbitrage between dex pools and sigmausd contract. Should generate more txs.


[10/11/2021 4:42 AM] Noro#6370
Neutral question here, at what point do we take a step back and say the incentives aren‚Äôt working out here?


[10/11/2021 4:44 AM] Noro#6370
The shorts have the advantage in that game and overtime the RSV/erg ratio keeps devaluing. Unless we get a continuous flow of new ppl to commit erg to the protocol, how does it succeed long term?


[10/11/2021 4:46 AM] Noro#6370
Raise the fee to swap from erg to usd and vice versa


[10/11/2021 4:48 AM] abchris#8522
Yeah there are a number of measures that have been brought forward by others, you‚Äôre probably familiar with them.


[10/11/2021 4:49 AM] Noro#6370
For sure, tbf I don‚Äôt know what the official opinion is on it for a suggested refinement


[10/11/2021 4:50 AM] Noro#6370
I tend to go back to, pick the easiest fix and start from there


[10/11/2021 4:51 AM] Noro#6370
I also believe this is more of a strategy / game theory issue rather than a technological one


[10/11/2021 4:58 AM] abchris#8522
For sure, it‚Äôs all about game theory, not my thing lol.
Re official opinion, all that matters is the governance token holders‚Äô opinion. We‚Äôll probably see other algo stables on Ergo at some point. There was one mentioned on the forum iirc.


[10/11/2021 5:00 AM] Noro#6370
That would be interesting to see if another stable coin comes out of it. AgeUSG is great, the fundamentals are there it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs being used as a Dex instead of a Reserve


[10/11/2021 5:01 AM] Noro#6370
Side note, great book is Game Theory at Work

why is there a limit at 800%?


[10/11/2021 10:58 AM] BrothaChad#0168
an infinitely high rr should be fine, no?


[10/11/2021 10:59 AM] BrothaChad#0168
or is it cause there is less effects from erg price on rsv if the rr is very high


[10/11/2021 11:16 AM] glasgowm#9381
It dilutes the position of the RSV holders

[10/11/2021 12:29 PM] BrothaChad#0168
is there a graph that shows rr vs. rsv position that you have easy access to?


[10/11/2021 12:31 PM] BrothaChad#0168
also, i see that the protocol used to have 1% fees. how come it went up to 2%? to support the reserves? this might hinder protocol utilisation since people are more inclined to exchange for stable coins like tether/USDC at lower rates instead. I much prefer using ageUSD ofc cause i love the concept but just wondering....

so when the protocol gets used more and is less prone to whale attacks, rates could go back to 1% is what im getting


[10/11/2021 12:42 PM] BrothaChad#0168
this article states the oracle is updated every 30 mins. i read on the ergo summit slides it's 12 mins. who do i trust 0.0


[10/11/2021 12:44 PM] BrothaChad#0168
last question. sorry. is the main source for oracles exchanges?


[10/11/2021 12:47 PM] glasgowm#9381
Possibly - if that happens while the contract is still changeable. Possibly changing back to immutable at one point in response to regulation.


[10/11/2021 12:48 PM] glasgowm#9381
I think it was spend up further after launch iirc. It's 12 minutes but the epoch where it switches takes a few too


[10/11/2021 12:48 PM] glasgowm#9381
As in what data-source they use? I'd imagine so - or coingecko/coinmarketcap


[10/11/2021 12:49 PM] BrothaChad#0168
is there a date for when it becomes immutable? or does DarkSideBrrrrr have this power

Can provide a csv with raw data if you want to make a custom graph for your vid.


[10/11/2021 7:41 PM] abchris#8522
The oracle is set to update every 6 blocks (each block is about 2 minutes). In practice it's often a bit more because transactions aren't always mined in the block they where created. And in rare cases it can drop to 5 blocks, but never below that. Check the oracle pool chart on ergo watch to have an idea of how it fluctuates.

[10/12/2021 3:36 AM] BrothaChad#0168
what's wrong with my drawing? im assuming erg price doubles. it's clear that rsv value dilutes with a higher rr given the equity multiple decreases, but how does one reach the 12.5% value for 400% rr and 6.25% value for 800% rr

[10/12/2021 4:06 AM] abchris#8522
Seems like you're thinking in dollar value while the infographic is looking ERG holdings. BUT, you did spot an error here I think. The 400% scenario in the infographic give 16.6%, not 12.5. Whoever did this thought RR=400 meant 4 times more equity than liabilities, but it's 3.


[10/12/2021 4:09 AM] BrothaChad#0168
ok.glad to know it's not a fatal flaw in my understanding xD


[10/12/2021 4:13 AM] abchris#8522
Think that 12.5%, 8.3% and 6.25% should be 16.7%, 10.0% and 7.1%


[10/12/2021 4:13 AM] BrothaChad#0168

So at 400% vs 800% reserve ratio, which will give more ERG back?


[10/13/2021 10:31 AM] glasgowm#9381
The lower the RR the better for when you're buying SigRSV


[10/13/2021 10:33 AM] Zeiezee#0876

[10/13/2021 10:34 AM] Zeiezee#0876
sry lemme add under the assumption price goes up


[10/13/2021 11:59 AM] glasgowm#9381
Doesn't make a difference. The dynamic size of the reserve during the price increase is more of a factor.


[10/13/2021 4:23 PM] Zeiezee#0876
There have been posts about people minting RSV since 5$ and when it hit 10+$ they actually came out with less. What caused this to happen? What are the values to look at when deciding to mint RSV and be incentivized for it?


[10/13/2021 4:24 PM] Zeiezee#0876
like what conditions A=true B= true hence ERG increases


[10/13/2021 4:24 PM] glasgowm#9381
Depends what happens inbetween the price change. If the price goes -50% and 80% of the reserve withdraws - any upside in price won't be reflected in RSV value


[10/13/2021 4:24 PM] glasgowm#9381

im guessing i have to wait for part 2 haha


[10/13/2021 4:36 PM] Zeiezee#0876
because basing on this, RR is the one to look at not ERG price? Low RR means more RSV minted, then if RR goes higher less RSV is minted. So higher RR means your RSV is worth more since you mint less. So mint RSV when low RR then redeem it when RR high? Where does ERG price come into play in this equation, because you said RR makes no difference between 400-800% when you also said lower RR = better for minting RSV.


[10/13/2021 4:37 PM] Zeiezee#0876

'ppreciate it dude! love the channel! üëç


[10/13/2021 4:58 PM] Zeiezee#0876
ok lemme think again, sigusd > rsv = low reserve, rsv > sigusd = high reserve, higher erg price = more sigusd minted per erg = less ergo in the pool

so when that happens when erg price drops sigusd takes out more erg than they put in which drains some from the RSV

if erg price goes up then sigusd redeems takes out less ERG and the remainder can be distributed to the RSV

so for RSV to get incentivized other than from fees, RSV has to rely on sigusd to mint when prices are low, but redeem when prices are high. 

But if Sigusd never redeems when prices are high, but instead decides to mint more sigusd and waits for prices to drop to redeem then sigusd will always be taking out more ERG then they put in, leaving less ERG for RSV to redeem?


[10/13/2021 4:59 PM] BrothaChad#0168
thank u bro üòÑ


[10/13/2021 5:02 PM] BrothaChad#0168
i believe u are correct, thats a long question tho D:


[10/13/2021 5:03 PM] Zeiezee#0876
hahaha


[10/13/2021 5:03 PM] Zeiezee#0876
makes me feel RSV holders are at the mercy of SigUSD holders


[10/13/2021 5:10 PM] Zeiezee#0876
But that also means to get incentivized the conditions are SigUSD redeem when price is high AND/OR more people mint RSV to increase the RR


[10/13/2021 5:20 PM] Zeiezee#0876
So in the graphic above Scenario 1 says, ERG down but reserves up, does that assume that SigUSD peeps are redeeming, or ERG price directly affects the amount of RSV minted anyways regardless?


[10/13/2021 7:27 PM] G. de Balboa#0001
RSV holders are ultimately at the mercy of the price of ERG, because its the ERG price that determines if traders win or lose when they short the value of erg by minting sigusd. Which is why i guess liquidity engine(dex) is important because you have more use cases for sigusd other than just shorting erg. More use cases might translate to increase value of erg (think about cross chain exposure). 

And so with the price of erg going up because of more use cases, rsv holders will start making money(increase in value of erg value translates to increase in reserve value), and more people are incentivized to put their holdings in RSV(because erg keeps going up) which keeps the ratio high. So I guess the only caveat here is if more sigusd use cases actually drives up the value of erg.


[10/13/2021 7:28 PM] G. de Balboa#0001
That's something we're just gonna have to wait to find out


[10/13/2021 7:28 PM] G. de Balboa#0001

@glasgowm  I met the developer of this app https://sanctuarydex.com/ (available on apple and android) at a conference last weekend.  They are essentially a POS for in person business transactions. As supplier of roofing products, they asked me "what coins would you like to have on this app?" I told them  SIGUSD, and we went into the trustless stable coin concept. What direction should I point them in? So they can looking into how to take part in developing sigusd coins into their app.

Hey man! That is awesome to hear, however, I'm not familiar with integrating SigUSD, I just know how it works xD You will probably need to get in touch with a dev to integrate SigUSD with the shopping platform unless the store wants to accept transactions via a wallet w apis.

right, i guess my expectation based on the ERG---->SigUSD graphic, was to get a calculation for an ERG value


[11/21/2021 12:25 AM] nitram147#5106
The logic was that you want to purchase some amount of SigmaUSD fe. 200, and that later you will want to redeem some amount of SigmaUSD back to ERG. In both cases you know how much SigmaUSD you want to purchase/redeem. However yes, from the "ERG ---> SigmaUSD" it sound like you should enter amount in ERG, however as you can see on the placeholder for the input field, there should be SigmaUSD value entered see:

Hi, 
I am pretty sure I sent funds to the RSV last week.

I am trying to "see" it somewhere to confirm how much I sent.     I cannot quite recall.

When I type in my wallet ID,  the website says I have 0.0000


[12/06/2021 7:34 PM] starelong#3949
I check Ergo explorer but because I am mining I have hundreds of transactions and I have not found it useful.

do you still have the issue?


[12/14/2021 12:01 PM] Q86#4155
Guys where to you see SigmaUSD to evolve over the longterm scale? I was wondering if its possible to easily add more reference values to the mechanic like sigmaAU (gold), sigmaEUR (Euro) and so on while sharing a common reserve pool in SigRSV.


[12/14/2021 12:10 PM] glasgowm#9381
The design supports a basket of assets too but it'd need to be relaunched with those parameters - you couldn't use the current implementation for that I guess unless you use some sort of index fund ontop


[12/17/2021 11:14 PM] egorishek#5517
Ok so I got into SigRSV when ERG was trading around $15 and the reserve ratio around 400-500%. As you can guess I‚Äôm down quite a bit of ERG because of it. I understand there are multiple factors to profitability on this trade such as reserve, reserve ratio, and ERG price. My question is if ERG price comes back is it still possible to get the ERG I‚Äôve lost back and perhaps more? For example, let‚Äôs say ERG reaches $25. Is there a way to calculate if this trade will be profitable or not?


[12/17/2021 11:18 PM] egorishek#5517
With some assumptions about the reserve and reserve ratio


[12/17/2021 11:28 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
No way of calculating it, all depends on how unsuccessful the sigUSD traders are really, but if ergo skyrockets up to $25 there's a chance, but if it's volatile, there's a chance it won't happen, too many variables to say anything for sure


[12/17/2021 11:33 PM] egorishek#5517
@Gazza_SP Yeah that's what I figured. I guess I'll continue to HODL and this will be a grand experiment.


[12/18/2021 8:05 PM] egorishek#5517
Just curious. Anyone here have a successful story on SigRSV?


[12/18/2021 9:01 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
Many people have seen profits what kind of success story is one looking for?


[12/18/2021 9:07 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
I‚Äôve seen it go from 8-900 to 550 so there was plenty of profits had . It‚Äôs essentially a long levered position . If you think erg is undervalued then it‚Äôs solid move


[12/18/2021 9:33 PM] egorishek#5517
@Ergonaut_Alpha I'm curious what the trade looked like because I've heard a few anecdotal stories of people unable to exit trade for a gain even if ERG price is up from when the SigRSV was initially minted (I've personally experienced this too). Has anyone documented the elements in play when entering the trade and exiting the trade? (i.e. ERG price, reserve amount, reserve ratio)


[12/18/2021 9:38 PM] egorishek#5517
And then of course what type of return did you see?


[12/18/2021 9:41 PM] egorishek#5517
Also, is there a way to determine what percentage of the pot you are entitled to? And how does one calculate the current pot available? Is it the excess amount after you factor in the minimum 400% the reserve needs?


[12/18/2021 10:28 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
I‚Äôm not sure that anyone has charted it for themself. But if you exchanged 100erg @ 950rsv you‚Äôd get 95,000 rsv and if that was in returned @ 550 you would get ~172 erg minus fees

[12/18/2021 11:01 PM] egorishek#5517
@Ergonaut_Alpha Could you help explain and/or give an example of how the erg to rsv ratio would go down? Or is there too many factors?


[12/18/2021 11:28 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
when the price goes up you will receive less rsv per erg . Price goes down you will receive more sig rsv per erg.

Everyone who cashed out by may 18 would've likely been in profit. You need the price to increase - while there's substantial reserves.

[12/19/2021 7:38 AM] abchris#8522
The "pot" for SigRSV holders is the equity, or whatever is left in the reserves after accounting for what's needed to cover minted SigUSD. The SigRSV you hold is a % of total circulating SigRSV and entitles you to the same % of equity (minus fees). You can redeem your entire SigRSV bag as long as this doesn't drop the reserve ratio below 400%.

ErgoWatch shows how much the equity currently amounts to (in ERG) and how much SigRSV can be redeemed.


[12/19/2021 5:21 PM] egorishek#5517
@abchris Ahh so your % of equity can vary. So then SigRSV holders would want circulating supply to come down to have a larger % of the equity and/or to have the amount of equity increase. And I don't see the circulating supply of SigRSV coming down anytime soon as I imagine a lot of people are under water atm and HODLing.


[12/19/2021 5:53 PM] abchris#8522
That‚Äôs exactly how SigRSV price is derived: equity / circulating SigRSV. Want you want is mostly an increase in equity. You can‚Äôt really lower circ sigrsv much without lowering equity as well (there‚Äôs fees from people redeeeming their sigrsv, but that‚Äôs it)


[12/19/2021 6:00 PM] egorishek#5517
@abchris Thanks for the info and putting together ergo.watch. This seems like a tricky trade for SigRSV holders atm as you need the right cocktail to come together and then you need to beat others out of the trade. I myself am extremely underwater but now just viewing it as an experiment and getting a better understanding of how the dynamics work. Cheers!


[12/19/2021 7:02 PM] egorishek#5517
Ok, I'm back with another question. Is it possible to know what the average price the current supply of SigUSD was minted at?


[12/20/2021 12:51 AM] abchris#8522
I don't think so because, just like any native token, it is mixable, so hard to keep track of individual tokens.

Can somebody explain to me the fees on sigmausd.io? It seems to cost hundreds to thousands to make the trade from erg to sigusd or back. It's extremely high to the point where its better to just use a CEX and trade to USDC (significantly better)


[01/07/2022 1:32 AM] Marty#4039
would really prefer to use the ergo blockchain but I can't find a way to make a trade between erg/sigusd on ergodex or sigmausd without losing thousands to fees. It's much worse than ethereum gas


[01/07/2022 7:48 AM] abchris#8522
There's a 2% protocol fee and 0.25% UI fee, none of which you have with centralised stable coins. On the other hand, with declining ERG prices and the oracle lagging somewhat due to its smoothing, you can sometimes get a better price than on exchanges, which can more than compensate the 2.25% tx fee.


[01/07/2022 8:23 AM] Marty#4039
2.25 is a huge fee..


[01/07/2022 8:25 AM] Marty#4039
I thought we were trying to be better than eth but I'd rather pay gas


[01/07/2022 8:28 AM] abchris#8522
It's what was deemed necessary to create enough incentive for SigRSV holders. Implement sigmausd on Eth and you'd have to pay gas fees on top the 2.25%.


[01/07/2022 8:28 AM] Marty#4039
A gas fee would be the same for a $500 purchase or a $500k purchase


[01/07/2022 8:30 AM] abchris#8522
Sure, and the 2.25% is not a network fee

The tax is insurance of the pegged value you're saying?


[01/07/2022 8:32 AM] abchris#8522
yes in the sense that it's what makes the protocol work in practice. No "tax", no backers, no SigUSD to mint.


[01/07/2022 8:34 AM] Marty#4039
That goes into rsv holder's pockets then?


[01/07/2022 8:35 AM] Marty#4039
But it seems like they have to trade in and out at a really specific time to get it


[01/07/2022 8:36 AM] abchris#8522
It goes to the reserve. RSV buyers hope the reserve share they are entitled to increases over time.


[01/07/2022 8:38 AM] Marty#4039
So could it be a lower percent and still be viable?

[01/07/2022 8:40 AM] abchris#8522
Possibly. IIRC, v1 had lower fees. They got raised in v2 to limit speculative sigusd minting (bearwhale saga etc).


[01/07/2022 8:43 AM] Marty#4039
The fees made it unreasonable to use for higher value treasuries. We wanted to transfer 100k but at $2500 fees it wasn't viable. Then market crashed so now we wait


[01/07/2022 8:44 AM] Marty#4039
Are you one of the devs behind sigma? Any plans to list on coinex or kucoin?


[01/07/2022 8:45 AM] Marty#4039
With a 2.5% fee it almost makes sense that sigmausd should be worth $1.025 üòâ


[01/07/2022 8:56 AM] abchris#8522
Nope, not involved. That would be a question for Armeanio or the EF. There's an AMA in a couple hours üòâ


[01/07/2022 9:01 AM] Marty#4039
Nice, I'll tune in!


[01/07/2022 11:29 AM] glasgowm#9381
sigma was community-launched, there were discussions about getting it on a CEX a while ago. Probably some legal things to consider though. With the SOL bridge we should be able to do a SigUSD-USDT pair soon on ErgoDex which would should make it a bit more accessible.


[01/07/2022 5:10 PM] Marty#4039
that would be phenomenal


[01/10/2022 1:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
Is hodling SigRSV and putting them into the ERG/SigRSV a good idea? 
I'm planning on doing this and leaving them there for years. I've thought it through and if my bullish sentiment is correct, am I right in assuming that this will be a very leveraged long position on both ERG and SigRSV if both rise in value in the long-term? 

Will I still experience impermanent loss if both assets rise in value?


[01/10/2022 3:14 AM] nox071218#1778
it'll depend on how correlated they are, also if you are truly in for years then the fees you get could offset any loss


[01/10/2022 3:16 AM] nox071218#1778
personally i have erg prices in my head. ill take half my liq out as i hit each mark. eventually if erg keeps going up i dont need so much in there anyway


[01/10/2022 5:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
I mean SigRSV is connected to ERG that's why it's a bit confusing when you take into account the LP


[01/10/2022 5:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
Like it's not just a random pair, outside the liquidity pool they're intertwined with each other, that's why I'm having a hard time imagining what might happen in a bull scenario


[01/10/2022 5:35 AM] nox071218#1778
They should be strongly correlated but it's not as simple as 1ERG=1sigRSV.  The value of sigRSV also takes into account the size of the reserves. So keep any eye on sigUSD the more widely used it is the better for both you and I


[01/10/2022 5:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes from what I understand, if ERG's value appreciates, and reserve is above 400% but less than 600%, the bonus is acquired will be at 12% plus fees


[01/10/2022 5:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
Then I guess the best thing to do would be to convert to sigRSV long term?


[01/10/2022 5:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
I'd also imagine it would be good for the ecosystem as it helps keep sigUSD's value stable


[01/10/2022 5:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
Since ERG is designed to be deflationary at some point, it's not hard for people to catch on that holding sigRSV is better than hodling ERG on its own.


[01/10/2022 5:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
Wow I just realised how elegant this stable coin protocol is.


[01/10/2022 3:05 PM] nox071218#1778
Don't forget sigUSD is tied to sigRSV. But a large reserve doesn't mean sigUSD is a success. It's all connected, ideally sigUSD becomes an alternative to centralized stable coins. If thing go well sigRSV is a good long for the protocol


[01/10/2022 3:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Having ADA available in Ergodex will bring great amounts of liquidity and volume for this stablecoin. I might just decide on going heavy with sigRSV. It makes perfect sense as it helps support the stable coin, and is much better than HODLing ERG on its own. What's the point of holding ERG, if the reason one holds ERG is because one expects the asset to go up in value. If this is the case, then just switch to sigRSV.


[01/10/2022 4:01 PM] nox071218#1778
Other liq pairs coming with SOL bridge too like USDT+sigUSD pairs. I'm not hating on your approach i have the same view just trying to give you a whole picture. Good luck to us both üçª

[01/23/2022 5:22 PM] question86#0000
Sigmausd.io is the spot where they are backuped with ERG to guarantee their value. Ergodex is the spot where you can trade most of the tokens of the ergo ecosystem, including sigrsv and sigusd.


[01/23/2022 5:23 PM] question86#0000
cheers, enjoy both dapps - be aware that minting and redeeming on sigusd.io costs 2.5% fee while on ergodex you pay only 0.5% fee to liquidity providers. therefore, depending on the amount you want to mint, consider to get your sigusd on ergodex

Just wondering has anyone here actually made a profit from SigRsv? Because I‚Äôve had bad luck so far. Got any useful tips?


[01/24/2022 11:33 AM] question86#0000
Slowly building a position right now. Over the last year, there was no real opportunity for SigRSV to be interesting. It started heavily overvalued and is now deep in winter.


[01/24/2022 11:34 AM] question86#0000
But building very slowly, actually i was looking for that 150% RR to get in more aggressive.


[01/24/2022 11:34 AM] question86#0000
But i am not sure we get there.


[01/24/2022 11:37 AM] Harry#0000
Yeah good idea, might start DCA sigrsv soon.


[01/24/2022 11:37 AM] question86#0000
We are at 310% RR, which means if i exit at 400% the gains will be decent but not overwhelming.


[01/24/2022 11:37 AM] question86#0000
But definately gonna exit at 401%.


[01/24/2022 11:39 AM] question86#0000
The Risk/Reward ratio gets exponentially better the closer RR gets to 100%, keep that in mind.


[01/24/2022 11:46 AM] question86#0000
So round about 1$ we would reach that point (1.38 mil SigUSD vs 1.423 mil Erg in the protocol) where RR comes close to 100%. At this point the SigRSV value would exponentially head to zero, making every ERG you trade for SigRSV exponentially more valuable while you have to at exponentially less ERG to the protocol to get the amount of SigRSV you desire (-> Risk drops exponentially aswell).


[01/24/2022 11:46 AM] question86#0000
*to add i mean


[01/24/2022 11:49 AM] question86#0000
This is the historcal price of ERG/SigRSV. You can see we are in a reverse sentiment to Erg/USD as expected.

[01/24/2022 11:50 AM] question86#0000
The thing is, when you withdraw your SigUSD value you do this by taking out ERG of the protocol, sucking the gains of SigRSV holders also.


[01/24/2022 11:52 AM] question86#0000
Which effectively only is a factor for SigRSV holders that got blocked when they entered above 400%. Because your "new" SigRSV did never get covered by SigUSD that has been minted (because you added SigRSV below 400% ratio, therefore no new SigUSD could be minted AFTER you added your ERG to the protocol.)


[01/24/2022 11:54 AM] question86#0000
By withdrawing your SigRSV at 400% (as soon as possible) you make sure no more new SigUSD get minted to demand your ERG as a backup. By doing this, you cant get bearwhaled.


[01/24/2022 11:55 AM] chrostpher#0000
I think there were some ideas of how to make it more profitable. Not sure if that has gone anywhere though.


[01/24/2022 11:56 AM] question86#0000
It is profitable but its also not easy. You have to understand the mechanics that determine the value of adding ERG to the protocol. (re @chrostpher: I think there were some ideas of how to make it more profitable. Not sure if that has gone anywhere ...)


[01/24/2022 11:58 AM] question86#0000
When it went live, everyone was allowed to add as much SigRSV as he/she wanted (which was basically a concept to get huge amounts of ERG added for propper liquidity from the beginning.) and this turned out to be a horrible mechanic for newbs. The risk/reward was insanely bad, the RR was even above 800% because this border was deactivated for weeks.


[01/24/2022 12:00 PM] question86#0000
Nowadays and everywhere below 400% RR the protocol works as intended. Just two factors came together: When ERG had its highs, the RR was insanely high because noone understood the mechanics of sigma very well, therefore it was a hard time for SigRSV. Since 6 months we are correcting downwards which is also a sh*tshow for SigRSV holders.


[01/24/2022 12:03 PM] question86#0000
However to recover from loss, the only real way i see right now for all the SigRSV holders is to either add ERG at a better price or to add SigRSV/USD to the liquidity pool & take their liquidity out at a very good price (which means you get very very much sigrsv for very very few sigusd). Then wait until 400% and redeem ERG.


[01/24/2022 12:04 PM] question86#0000
The most important thing i had to understand is that the protocol first and foremost is an ERG accumulator. On both sides.


[01/24/2022 12:07 PM] chrostpher#0000
Good advice. I‚Äôve been waiting for the bottom for a while now üòÇ


[01/24/2022 12:09 PM] question86#0000
Yes, we all do. Most early supporters went in blindly (including me) because the meta was SigRSV = longterm easy gains. And many Ergo community members think longterm. (re @chrostpher: Good advice. I‚Äôve been waiting for the bottom for a while now üòÇ)


[01/24/2022 12:11 PM] question86#0000
Which lead to a simple market mechanic. Way too many ERG (therefore low value) were offered which cause the price of SigRSV to heavily decouple from the actual value.


[01/25/2022 5:09 AM] VertErgo#5544

Is there a way to improve its usability?  When more people start using Ergo and SigUSD/SigRSV, it'll just get worse.


[01/25/2022 11:22 AM] glasgowm#0000
dApp connectors will help.


[01/25/2022 11:30 AM] VertErgo#5544
How?


[01/25/2022 11:43 AM] glasgowm#9381
Because you can set slippage and avoid some problems the assembler has

Having difficulty here using Yoroi to send to SigmaUSD for sigRSV purchase, anyone been able to make the swap? Would it be better to use Ergodex?


[01/26/2022 10:47 AM] glasgowm#9381
yes - maybe yoroi acting up with the assembler


[01/26/2022 12:38 PM] Thomas#0000
I don't know but SigmaUSD.io seems to be down. I bought in the crash SigmaRSV. After a while I checked and SigmaRSV was way up and much more TVL. From 1.5 Million to 6-7 Millions. You can't buy because of Whale abuse, it says. Redeem is also not working. SigRSV seems undevalued at ErgoDEX and airdrop coming? So I bought some more for all my few ERG at ErgoDEX. We''ll see. (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <Chris Horticulturalist> Having difficulty here using Yoroi to send to SigmaUSD for sigRSV purchase,...)

Question about DexyUSD: will it be bad for sigRSV holders if there's another stablecoin that can be minted? sigUSD might not be adopted as much if there's another stablecoin to choose from


[01/28/2022 2:19 PM] glasgowm#0000
Dexy uses seigniorage I believe so there are other downfalls. The stablecoin aspect itself of SigUSD works great. Just unclear how SigRSV will fair in market conditions.

I have been a holder of RSV since the low 700‚Äôs. About 9 months ago. My original belief was that there would be rewards for holding it , not just the potential for increased valuation. Was/is this a misconception on my part or will this eventually take place?


[02/01/2022 3:35 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
This was a misconception, the only way sigRSV value goes up is with price and minting/redeeming. There's no real usage yet for SIG so it hasn't had a chance to go up in value (re @Richard: I have been a holder of RSV since the low 700‚Äôs. About 9 months ago. My original belief was that there would be rewards for holding it , not just the potential for increased valuation. Was/is this a misconception on my part or will this eventually take place?)

Is there no particular problem?


[02/01/2022 5:22 PM] question86#0000
The reward is the passive increase of value due to the fact that any minting / trading back in the protocol take 2.5% fee in ERG which goes into the liquidity reserve, therefore directly sums up the value you hold with SigRSV - however, i will explain more detailed in the guide why the early liquidity providers will have to really hold a long time to see their investment get payed off.

- SigUSD/USDT pair
- SigUSD Ledger support
- Some sort of ergodex token as reward for LP + better analytics
- Mixing/Minting SigUSD within wallets
These are all relatively close and should provide decent utility/demand.

Do you think that there will be more minting and redeeming of SigUSD when more adoption? I believe that already minted SigUSD will stay in circulation but instead of redeeming them, people would just buy something on dex....

[02/07/2022 1:36 PM] glasgowm#0000
depends on the situation. Some whale might put $50k in SigUSD as a nest-egg and then get drawn out by an ergo-pump with a better rate available on sigmausd.io
But yeah it also means a lot of sigUSD will be sold/used multiple times. (re @KalloShaman: Do you think that there will be more minting and redeeming of SigUSD when more adoption? I believe that already minted SigUSD will stay in circulation but instead of redeeming them, people would just buy something on dex....)


[02/07/2022 1:50 PM] Gstoiti#0000
One major problem in the past for rsv holders was that all sigusd were redeemed at the start of a pump and hence sig rsv didn't benefit from the pump at all (only a very tiny impact from fees). So I think what's really important for sigrsv holders is that there is always a significant amount of sigusd in circulation.

I believe that already minted SigUSD will stay in circulation but instead of redeeming them, people would just buy something on dex....)

IMO the risk/reward has not been good for RSV. Still isn't. We are in a global market downtrend, and getting locked into a position can be painful.
However, we are seeing many new projects spring up, and use sigUSD. That is promising. The true value/profits come from the usage. As the usage grows, RSV starts to profit regardless of the price action.

Liquidity Mining bootstraps liquidity in LPs via a token. On Dexes its usually a governance and/or revenue share token. Think sushi, uniswap, etc. Same can be applied to lending protocols (aave, geist, etc).

As far as I know, ErgoLend is not a standard crypto lending platform, but instead they focus on loans for projects and people who don't have access to bank loans. Hence, I guess the volume of loans and SigUSD won't be large (at the start).

So when Erg goes below 1 SigRSV goes to 0. Of coarse also depends on Reserve Ratio. When 100% bye SigRSV. Correct?


[02/22/2022 5:19 PM] Thomas#0000
A lot of shorting goin on. I saw over 50% interest rate for ETH yesterday in Kucoin. Sent my ETH to lend and they are still borrowed for 57% üßê

Billions of ETH shorted


[02/22/2022 5:27 PM] glasgowm#0000
It‚Äôs not directly tied to the price because the incentive to mint SigRSV and withdraw SigUSD is inverse to the price.

I am very happy for ergodex and SigRSV. And the big dumpsters. Trading up my crypto in the downtrend. ü•∞

What if Ergo partners with Flux? Have a chat with Dan Keller.


[02/22/2022 7:15 PM] Thomas#0000
There should be more incentives for SigRSV. No fees for SigRSV. Only fees for SigUSD mint and redeem and maybe more. Some derivative financial Pro might have a tip. Black Scholes whatever


[02/22/2022 7:44 PM] Thomas#0000
Some Penalty Haircut for SigUSD holders when ERG (reserves or Price ) falling below some Triggers. So they are motivated to fill reserve themselves.


[02/22/2022 7:46 PM] Thomas#0000
No fees to mint SigRSV. This is rly stupid imho


[02/22/2022 7:51 PM] Ile#0000
This would make sigUSD pretty bad stablecoin? (re @Thomas: Some Penalty Haircut for SigUSD holders when ERG (reserves or Price ) falling below some Triggers. So they are motivated to fill reserve themselves.)


[02/22/2022 7:53 PM] Ile#0000
This would make the protocol exploitable. There is a delay in oracle price. If ERG price shoots up, I could buy rsv, and exit as soon as oracle price catches up. (re @Thomas: No fees to mint SigRSV. This is rly stupid imho)

Smaller and/or dynamic fees are on the table though


[02/23/2022 12:29 AM] erdoge1#0000
yeah fee for SigRSV is extra bad while I'm already raped by declining value. It's cheaper to trade on DEX, so even less incentive to mint more RSV. Maybe should be lower fee compared to SigUSD.

@glasgowm Does upgrading SigmaUSD protocol to v3 in the future require making a new contract, and therefore v2 won't be actively used anymore (Even though it's accessible).


[02/23/2022 5:05 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
Yes same as v1, why would it change to v3 though? (re @erdoge1: @glasgowm Does upgrading SigmaUSD protocol to v3 in the future require making a new contract, and therefore v2 won't be actively used anymore (Even though it's accessible).)

V2 has governance, so can modify some parameters while keeping same contract, unlike v1.

Yes. The mechanisms take some effort. And dynamics are always evolving.

[02/24/2022 1:49 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Sure, it is easy when you know what the reserve ratio means. I just think the reserve ratio should be explained (like you just did) somewhere on sigmausd.io on the dashboard as well as in the StableCoin tab. And I think it should be featured more prominently on the dashboard.
There are many people who are still overwhelmed by the interface and the mechanism. Although, as you said, the stablecoin side is very simple.
Overall, I think the website is designed for rsv buyers and not for people who just want to use a stablecoin. (re @Ile: Yes. The mechanisms take some effort. And dynamics are always evolving.

[02/24/2022 1:51 PM] Gstoiti#0000
What I mean is that by looking at the website one gets the feeling that the project is a prototype project for Ergo's smart contracts (and oracles and the AgeUSD protocol), but not a finished product which the average guy should use.


[02/24/2022 1:53 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Changing that impression would probably also bring more adoption.

Just write "DON'T BUY RSV" on the rsv page.  That's what the average user needs to know.

Just read through this thread, and as a slightly above average average guy, I agree üòâ  The site is very functional but a bit institutional.  If the goal is greater adoption, expanding the FAQ page might help.   There are a lot of good links, but maybe a "start here" page.  Walk people through what they are seeing and what they are about to experience.  Some people that land on this site likely don't fully understand stable coins aside from what they've heard on the news or read up briefly on reddit, and specifically what separates SigUSD from say USDT.  Very much excited about everything that's going on with this platform!  keep up the good work!

Sorry to drag out an old conversation, but if "+100% means you get your dollar value back" is what you intended to write then I think @Gstoiti 's point is demonstrated in your reply. The reserve ratio must be between 400-800% in order to mint/redeem both SigUSD/RSV; below 400% and you can't mint SigUSD, nor redeem RSV; and vice-versa when it's above 800%.I had thought this info was more readily available, but after reading this convo I looked & couldn't find found any direct links on the sigmausd.io dashboard. The "Age USD Protocol" link is an old article that explains the idea but is not very specific about numbers. The link to ergoplatform.org is generic. Follow the link to the sigmaverse.io page & I need to search "SigmaUSD" but get only a link back to sigmausd.io. And clicking ergonaut.space takes me to the Ergonaut Handbook landing page, where I need to either scroll down to find the "What is SigmaUSD" guide, or enter "sigma" in the search bar to find the details. And I completely missed the upper-right corner of the dashboard, which only shows as a box with three lines inside. Click on this and yes there indeed is the FAQ! But it was not obvious (to me), so I'm agreeing with Klaus & mbshawaii that the website could be made more inviting to the uninitiated: there could be a more obvious explanatory tab available on the sigmausd.io dashboard; a direct link to the SigmaUSD section of the Ergonaut Handbook; even a link to ergo.watch/sigmausd would be helpful! üòÄ And not that I'd want it for myself, but my impression is that these days people do not want to read if they can avoid it, so a video tutorial/guide would probably lower the entry barrier even further. üëç (re @Ile: Yes.

Ya know, I think technically you're correct, but at the same time not? ü§î I mean, the current situation with the dex/protocol is really interesting to me. Yes I can buy Erg for 2.68 SigUSD on the Dex, but then what do I do with it to realise profit? I can't mint SigUSD meaning the oracle price of 3.35 SigUSD is irrelevant until someone makes a substantial reserve deposit, so no opportunities there for the time being. Right now the price on the Dex can only go up organically, by people trading in the existing SigUSD they hold (and not by arbitrage), and with the present liquidity it would take a lot of SigUSD to raise the price 20%. I.e., until the reserve ratio or the Dex price goes up you can't get your original SigUSD back without incurring a loss. I can sell that Erg on a CEX for USDT, but then what do I do with that? Convert to fiat; buy another coin; or wait/hope for the price of Erg to fall so I can buy it back at a better price? I want my original SigUSD back plus some profit! üòÄ I guess what I'm saying is, as far as I'm concerned right now my Erg is presently worth more in USDT, and worth less in SigUSD, though ideally those should be about the same.

I think you have some misunderstanding there.
Yes, the arbitrage loop is not complete, which means that the external market price can deviate from sigmausd.io price when minting is locked. 
However, the peg should only break to the upside. You can always redeem sigUSD in sigmausd.io. so the arbitrage does work in that direction. 
I would much rather hold sigusd in crash than USDT or any other stablecoin. No worries about unexpectedly losing peg. You actually get more than 1$ if you utilize the price differential.

Was there a situation with 2.68 on Ergodex and 3.35 on oracle price? 
Here you could just buy on Ergodex, and sell in sigmausd.
Currently the prices are 3.72 in ergodex and 3.41 in oracle. Cant do arbitrage because rr<400%. However, all sigUSD holders have an option to sell with a favorable price.

[03/02/2022 1:30 PM] question86#0000
From another perspective it also means that 1 SigUSD = 1.24 USDT. I also think the current situation is interesting because it offers 2 insights: SigUSD is seen as "precious" in a way that it expressed the higher level of trust compared to USDT. 2) The situation also expresses a higher demand for SigUSD compared to other stablecoins, which might be based on new usecases that came up during the RR was below 400%, as well as obviously a high trust in the ERG ecosystem as a whole.

There is only like 700k SigUSD outside of Ergodex. Lots of Manipulation going on. In the recent dip USDT was overvalued. Lower Price in USDT for Altcoins on Kucoin than from BTC. Maybe the FED‚Äòs PPT is doing all it can to keep some faith in their evil System.

Hey guys I was playing with this calculator https://sigusd.abchris.xyz/ to figure out if I should get some SigmaRSV. I was playing with the ERG price and it looks like if the price of ERG doubles I increase my ERG bag by 15% where as if the price halfs I decrease my ERG bag by 40%.  Is this correct?

Also, if Erg doubles then 15% additional Erg are worth more than 40% Erg after its price halfs (0.15*2>0.4*0.5), so the additional reward is higher than the additional loss in dollar (not in Erg) in your example compared to just holding Erg.

...I can get fees for building a UI?


[03/02/2022 8:56 PM] Gstoiti#0000
I think you can just make a new website that uses the SigUSD contracts and set an additional UI fee of your choice. If I remember it correctly, the UI fee of the current version was 0.25%. If your UI is good, people might prefer to use it or new users might want to use it and pay the fees. (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <SoCool> ...I can get fees for building a UI?)


[03/02/2022 8:56 PM] SoCool#6419
For a bit of perspective; the SigUSD to erg ratio has definitely been hovering around that for a few days on the dex  - but you can't buy it on Sigmacoin site because of low reserve of course. Presumably at a point in the future, the reserve will be large when the ecosystem is significantly engaged more broadly

It's a reserve so I presume it's a dynamic akin to buying treasury bonds


[03/02/2022 8:59 PM] glasgowm#0000
It's like buying a share in the utilisation of sigmausd


[03/02/2022 9:00 PM] SoCool#6419

I mean.. if people use SigUSD, RSV holders don't get a cut on every transaction or anything - is that right? Is it a share in the *purchase of SigUSD through the treasury* ?


[03/02/2022 9:03 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Rsv holders get the fees for minting and redeeming + they get the value that SigUSD holders lose compared to holding Erg, when Erg goes up. (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <SoCool> I mean.. if people use SigUSD, RSV holders don't get a cut on every transaction or anything - is that right?

[03/02/2022 9:05 PM] Gstoiti#0000
For both, protocol utilisation is needed. More minting and redeeming -> more fees, more SigUSD in circulation -> more value is lost by stablecoin holders compared to holding Erg when it goes up


[03/02/2022 9:08 PM] Gstoiti#0000
The problem is that if the SigUSD aren't locked anywhere in a DeFi protocol, stablecoin holders will redeem them at the start of an up movement and rsv holders don't gain a lot (but they still face big risks when erg price goes down). Hence, we need protocols where users lock/use stablecoins to prevent that they redeem. NightOwl Casino, ErgoDex liquidity pools and lending protocols will help.


[03/02/2022 9:15 PM] SoCool#6419
This is the most concise and clear description of the actual mechanism I've heard, thanks! The incentive is obvious now!

[03/05/2022 5:24 AM] bernerami#0000
Not perceiving what I've misunderstood, so perhaps you could clarify what you think that is? Yes one can always redeem SigUSD, but in this scenario the exchange loop was only open in a direction that leads to a net loss! My post was highlighting the fact that a significant SigUSD to USDT/USDC/USD price differential exists in the first place. I'm getting the impression that some people think it's no big deal (or even good) if the "stablecoin" breaks its peg (in a direction that they can profit from), but I was imagining a good functioning stablecoin as one that doesn't deviate significantly from its peg in either direction. I'd like to be able to preserve value during a rally as well as a crash. (re @Ile: I think you have some misunderstanding there.
Yes, the arbitrage loop is not complete, which means that the external market price can deviate from sigmausd.io price when minting is locked. 
However, the peg should only break to the upside. You can always redeem sigUSD in sigmausd.io. so the arbitrage does work in that direction. 
I would much rather hold sigusd in crash than USDT or any other stablecoin. No worries about unexpectedly losing peg. You actually get more than 1$ if you utilize the price differential.)


[03/05/2022 5:45 AM] bernerami#0000
Yah, personally I don't think this is the right way to be thinking about it? You are talking about SigUSD as though it were like any other token whose value should go up and down with people's confidence in the Ergo ecosystem. If SigUSD is seen as "more precious" or "less precious" than USDT, USDC, UST or whatever then how is it functioning as a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar? I don't think you can claim it reflects a greater level of trust compared to USDT, because the price of USDT relative to USDC, UST and the US Dollar itself didn't change. Only SigUSD changed relative to the dollar, and one could just as easily argue that this occurred due to a lack of confidence in the Ergo ecosystem, because nobody wanted to risk investing in the reserve coin. And the "high demand" can just as easily be understood as "low supply" - again, because not enough RSV being minted. (re @question86: From another perspective it also means that 1 SigUSD = 1.24 USDT. I also think the current situation is interesting because it offers 2 insights: SigUSD is seen as "precious" in a way that it expressed the higher level of trust compared to USDT. 2) The situation also expresses a higher demand for SigUSD compared to other stablecoins, which might be based on new usecases that came up during the RR was below 400%, as well as obviously a high trust in the ERG ecosystem as a whole.)


[03/05/2022 7:39 AM] Ile#0000
I agree that only keeping peg one way is not optimal. However, this is a side effect of locking the minting of sigUSD when the collateral is not high enough. It achieves the main goal of preserving sigUSD value at or above 1$. 
Do you have some suggestions on how to solve the unpegging to upside? I have seen some that might alleviate it, but I dont see a complete solution because of the locking. 
- simultaneous minting of rsv and usd at <400% rr for doing arb.
- varying fees.
- different rr thresholds for minting/redeeming rsv and usd. 
Maybe stablecoin is a misleading name, if it cant be solved. Value preserving coin could be more appropriate. In doing that, nothing is safer.
Comparisons to USDT, USDC or UST are difficult, because they are centralized. (re @bernerami: Not perceiving what I've misunderstood, so perhaps you could clarify what you think that is? Yes one can always redeem SigUSD, but in this scenario the exchange loop was only open in a direction that leads to a net loss! My post was highlighting the fact that a significant SigUSD to USDT/USDC/USD price differential exists in the first place. I'm getting the impression that some people think it's no big deal (or even good) if the "stablecoin" breaks its peg (in a direction that they can profit from), but I was imagining a good functioning stablecoin as one that doesn't deviate significantly from its peg in either direction. I'd like to be able to preserve value during a rally as well as a crash.)

In the marketing speech is decentralized, but actually its not. 
They just bumbed the anchor reserve with 500 million. Not the first intervention to keep the ponzi going. The protocol cant stand on its own, and few people are in charge. No better than USDT. 
Altogether, they are paying unsustainable profits from new money coming into the system. That is how ponzis work. (re @tabhab2020: UST is not really centralised right ?)

[03/05/2022 8:53 AM] Ile#0000
Depends what you need it for. Quick trades and yield opportunities are better with the centralised ones, because there is more access.
That comes with the cost of depegging risk. I would not hold long. SigUSD risks are transparent, and smaller due to high rr. (re @tabhab2020: So if u had to urgently buy a stable coin today which wud u buy ?)

i invest in crypto because i don't believe in bailout, otherwise i would invest in the us dollars. i think the relief will have to come in the form of defi use cases, and maybe new improvements to the ageusd/djed protocol as a whole to make it more desirable to hold rsv. but there should be no free money/airdrop.

I'm a big believer too but I cashed out RSV at a profit and buy USD on downtrends for more. It's not a buy it and leave it forever deal, not in downtrends.


[03/05/2022 9:06 AM] tabhab2020#0000
Yeah I wud love to knw when Yoroi goes mainstream with DEX rather than in Yoroi nightly, with use cases we will do well but right now no one really needs to buy SigUSD for use cases (re @erdoge1: i invest in crypto because i don't believe in bailout, otherwise i would invest in the us dollars. i think the relief will have to come in the form of defi use cases, and maybe new improvements to the ageusd/djed protocol as a whole to make it more desirable to hold rsv. but there should be no free money/airdrop.)

if ergopad and anetabtc and other projects like ergolend or casino start utilizing sigusd it will see more demand. but its going to take time.

I haven't looked deeply at Coti what what yield scheme or plan they will have to make reserve token for djed be more desirable to hold, or it will just naturally performs well on cardano due to more traffic and demands therefor people will simply mint much more stablecoins on Cardano compared to Ergo side.


[03/05/2022 9:15 AM] Gstoiti#0000
Coti's djed will be centralised. Normal users won't be able to participate on the reserve side afaik.

[03/05/2022 9:48 AM] Ile#0000
I believe there can be. It would require building the reserve from usage fees, instead of people providing collateral. 
That is s big compromise on the scaling and liquidity, but it would be even more resilient. (re @erdoge1: there can't be sigusd without sigrsv)

For me it is fascinating how many people only care about what IOG does. Many Cardano holders I know think immediately (only) of Djed and Coti when talking about stable coins on Cardano, although there are alternatives and basically everyone could create a version of Djed. As if IOG could decide which will be "the Cardano stable coin." Same with oracles and chainlink btw.


[03/05/2022 9:59 AM] erdoge1#0000
mainly because iog endorse and partner with them, which in effect making them sort of official.

NFA - maybe this truly is the bottom and over the span of years you‚Äôll be laughing. 
If it were me what I‚Äôd do is split a chunk into the sRSV/ERG pool and sUSD/ERG and then turning some SigUSD back into erg on dips, buying more on peaks and trying to reclaim. But maybe you‚Äôd end up loosing even more money that way lol so NFA.


[03/05/2022 10:16 AM] glasgowm#0000
but I‚Äôve noticed sRSV basically retains its erg value in dips in the pool - but no proper analytics apps to say this conclusively


[03/05/2022 10:16 AM] Ile#0000
Someone would need to seed it.
I was thinking, since its a public good, you could market it as parking money there as a charity. 
For example, lock yourself into a forced hold for one year (no yield). That temporary reserve would allow more stablecoin minting, and reserve building. Then return the funds after a year. 
Slow to build liquidity, but huge competitive edge. No obligation to pay out profit. And no pressure for collateral to hunt for higher yield (which rsv holders do). That would allow even higher rr and lower fees. (re @glasgowm: what would it be backed by originally?)

A proposal for a public good stablecoin
Summary  We propose a design for an extremely resilient decentralized algorithmic stablecoin. It has two major differences compared to the current stablecoins in the cryptomarket. First, no governance. Contrary to common intuition, relying on human judgement in a time of crisis is not a source of stability. Instead, a clear transparent code is s...

There is a typo at the beginning of subsection 3.3 (should be 200$ fees instead of 20$). (re @Ile: I wrote this into a proposal on the forum:
https://www.ergoforum.org/t/a-proposal-for-a-public-good-stablecoin/3432
Extremely resilient stablecoin backed by ERG/BTC pegged to gold, no governance, no RSV holders, no owners. 
I would be happy to hear, if anyone has ideas on how to internalize the prices into the protocol.)

My first thoughts: accumulating collateral through fees happens very slowly, but dips of the collateral + stablecoin redemption can drain the reserves very fast. I doubt that this will lead to long-term increasing reserves in expectation. (re @Ile: I wrote this into a proposal on the forum:

Idea for an extension: if the stablecoin is a public good, then we could probably take parts of the storage rents and/or transaction fees and use it as collateral inflow. Of course that makes only sense if the remaining rents + transaction fees would still be large enough to incentivise enough miners.


[03/07/2022 10:59 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I like this idea actually. Like a burn that goes to backing the stablecoin. If nobody can withdraw, tho, I'm not sure it would hold the peg.

or would the rsv go directly to miners? maybe that is simpler


[03/07/2022 11:06 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Now I get it. My idea would be to implement something similar to the soft fork. A miner would collect the storage rent, but that would trigger a smart contract/protocol rule which sends x% directly to the reserve treasury.


[03/07/2022 11:08 PM] Gstoiti#0000
You mean the rsv tokens? I think one important aspect of Ile's idea is that there are no rsv tokens. (re @TIMRŒ£G7: or would the rsv go directly to miners? maybe that is simpler)

If the design does not accumulate collateral over time, then it is a fail.
Do you think that is the case for sigmausd currently? That would make holding rsv senseless. (re @Gstoiti: My first thoughts: accumulating collateral through fees happens very slowly, but dips of the collateral + stablecoin redemption can drain the reserves very fast. I doubt that this will lead to long-term increasing reserves in expectation.)


[03/08/2022 6:11 AM] Ile#0000
The mindset is that bootstrapping liquidity creates problems further down the road. Profits need to be paid out and/or gov tokens lead to plutocracy.
Instead, the goal is to try to design something immutable that last forever.
It is ok if the accumulation is slow, but I agree that it can be too slow to have any meaning.


[03/08/2022 6:17 AM] Ile#0000
This is an interesting idea. Its like dev funds in other chains paid with inflation. Except that those dev funds more often get used for non-public goods or for attracting mercanary capital with liquidity incentives. 
For public goods, I might support it. The problem would just be that who gets to decide what is a public good.

Actually, I think holding (in terms of not actively buying and selling) rsv is senseless atm, since the impact of fees on the reserve seems extremely low. But I have no data.
It is really hard to estimate how many fees would be accumulated and how trading the stablecoin on a dex will affect this. I guess the majority of people would get the stablecoin on a dex, which would take away a part of the minting/redeeming fees, but on the other hand might create arbitrage opportunities which lead to minting/redeeming.
I would love to see your concept in action and would be happy to donate some Erg for the starting reserve. But maybe a good first step would be to track the fees accumulated by the SigmaUSD contract for a few weeks/months? Especially, since there will be some dApps like NightOwl which require SigUSD soon.

Yeah, probably hard to sell to the average crypto user, since they would see it as taxation. (re @Ile: This is an interesting idea. Its like dev funds in other chains paid with inflation.

Agree about your view on rsv. Though, it may be changing even now.
It would be interesting to research how much usage is required to make reliable profit.
I would also not mind if my proposed stablecoin would be a small hobbyproject at start. Better to test all vulnerabilities and bugs in small scale first.

At some point I was also thinking about taxing trades on Ergodex. Safemoon style. 5% tax on trade, put all of that into liquidity. 
I find it funny, that these memecoins have actually found a way to accumulate price stabilizing liquidity. Something that all algostables are not even attempting, because they are focused on making profit.

Many of the SigRSV holders are stuck in contract, cant redeem, arent flexible. It is very contraproductive if people now even cant mint SIGRSV. Makes it even worse for the providers to participate. Not good. Please devs, help debug-ing.

Forwarded from Ergo_Boy: Back to the SigUSD/RSV discussion for a sec: if we can‚Äôt convince the voters to change the protocol to add incentives; maybe ergopad team can incentivize outside the protocol. Ie. artificially incentivize holders to move the ratios from incentives outside of the protocol.
1. Find list of all RSV USD holders, drop them corresponding tokens.
2. Only by minting USD or RSV you get more tokens.
3. Create value from new tokens say through staking. Rewards vary depending on current ratios.
I would love for @martyergo and the team to tackle a project  like this and return ratios of RSV/USD to how they are meant to be.
Edit: shoot how do you incentivize redeeming of usd and RSV?

Do you have problems with yoroi or with sigmausd.io?


[03/19/2022 6:40 PM] bernerami#0000
Thanks very much for the reply, sorry for my own belated response because I appreciate the conversation! So firstly, we're in agreement about SigUSD generally maintaining value at or above 1$. I guess I have assumed all along that SigUSD was meant to maintain (roughly) equivalent value with the US Dollar. If that is the source of my misunderstanding then OK, point taken! üëç But you have to concede that calling it "SigUSD" strongly suggests that this is one of its intended purposes. üòú As you alluded to, I think for most people "stable coin" implies that it maintains constant value relative to some other measure like fiat, gold, etc.
As before, I don't mean to suggest that the SigmaUSD Protocol is "not working" - but obviously there is a lot of frustration being expressed here & elsewhere about the way in which it *is* working. Perhaps some of that is due to general misconceptions about how it is *supposed* to work, in which case I suppose it can become easy to confuse "less than optimal" & "not working"?
I mean, what we're seeing is that SigUSD won't necessarily maintain a strict peg to $1, especially under market conditions where the incentive to mint/hold SigRSV is low. And if that's how it's meant to work, well then fine & it's not misleading to advertise it as a store of value, albeit one that rises and falls though always has $1 as its minimum. I imagine lots of people would see that as good & something they'd want to hold in their investment portfolio, but when it comes to business & finances I feel it's often the case that "predicability" & "certainty" & "stability" can be considered more important/valuable.
For example, what are the implications for Night Owl Casino - who are promoting "USD-pegged bets" - if in fact they are offering "SigUSD-pegged bets" yet 1 SigUSD =/= $1? Is there an added risk of impermanent loss when providing liquidity to NightOwl? Is there a chance the peg between <clipped message>


[03/20/2022 7:05 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
I dont disagree with any of that. 
The way I see it, there are no decentralized, resilient and long-term sustainably stable stablecoins in the market. 
They all make some compromises. Usually profit motives pushes down collateral, which kills the long term sustainability. Centralization is another easy solution. 
SigUSD has high collateral, and transparent stats on its health. That makes it to me better than all others. USDT, UST... There is just no way to quantify the risk. 
SigUSD makes its own tradeoffs, and some are just flaws that may be solved with better design. Now there is a revived strong push for changes, so maybe we will see some soon.
The problem I see in the current discussion is that people just point out the problems. What is missing, are proposals that understand the problems, trade-offs and propose solutions. (re @bernerami: Thanks very much for the reply, sorry for my o...)

it is a complex contract but if you read and understand it carefully you know how you can access the bank and swap the tokens

Yeah, I think that is a good idea. Very simple orderbook dex. Muesliswap style. I actually personally like that over amm.

that is another topic than sigusd, but actually I am thinking of doing it as a side project to show off ergopay capabilities


[03/21/2022 9:34 AM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
If anyone is interested, that kind of contract could be separate from sigmausd. Take smaller than sigmausd fee for trades. Send the collected fees to the sigmausd reserves.
Alleviates lock situations. Extra fees for rsv holders.
Winwin. Just need a builder. 
I think this is a good addition to the SIP proposals. Any thoughts?

muesliswap like swap dapp - so yes, orderbook-like


[03/21/2022 12:19 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
And sigusd. 
If liquidity is low on Ergodex, then I can't sell large bag now. Someone in the orderbook might be interested on buying. 
So it would allow trade in big bag - low liq cases, even if contract is locked. (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <Glasgow> Doing what? order-book RSV?)


[03/21/2022 12:21 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
if I would build it, would be for all tokens, so if you sell SigUSD or Mi Goreng, that's no difference. 
BTW, you want to sell it for higher than $1 right now?


[03/21/2022 12:37 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
If there is a shortage of sigusd, then the market price is above 0.98c. You could still sell all in sigmausd.io for that price. 
The price might be 1.1$ on ergodex for example, but only up to 10k because of liquidity.
Buyer and seller could meet in orderbook somewhere in between. For example, 100k$ deal at 1.03$ price point. (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <MrStahlfelge> if I would build it, would be f...)

Is sigmausd being faded out? Should we stop discussing improvements?
Ageusd/sigmausd/djed is not a zero-sum model. Stablecoin holders buy a service of stability from collateral providers, who are compensated with fees. It serves a demand, and therefore it is +sum.
So far with current settings and usage, sigmausd has not been good enough in doing the compensation. I think with a set of improvements, it can achieve that. 
The bigger problem is that it might never attract enough liquidity to scale up, because people prefer profits over stability in short term. However, sigmausd would still serve the set of people who do prefer the safety over profits.


[03/25/2022 7:47 AM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
Forwarded from Ile: Capital efficiency is tricky. If you leave it up to the people/markets, then they will overextend risk and fail sooner or later. 
If you set safety high (low capital eff.), like in sigmausd, then there will always be better yield options for collateral providers. Long track record or warnings about stability don't matter, because people are again happy to overextend risk.
The way I see it, you can get around this problem only by accumulating protocol owned collateral, which is not in the hands of people. This collateral can do automated yield farming or not. Farming provides income, but creates an external dependency.

On a 6mo+ bleed, a long position done as you'd expect. It's whether you can fix profit more successfully than than others on average, over time that's interesting/unknown.


[03/25/2022 9:30 AM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
> *(re @Gstoiti)*: But it is still a zero-sum game regarding Erg.... 
True. I conflated utility and zero sum game terms. In terms of ERG moving, it is zero sum
It is easier to think about the utility at the time of the deal. Some people demand stability, other fees from providing that stability. They meet on market, both get what they want, utility is created compared to no-trade situation. 
Market fundamentalists leave it at that. Free markets = best outcomes. I would be the first to argue against that, but not in the case of RSV causing pain. That is just the risk takers risks realizing.

Yeah, sure. It should be a fair deal at the time of the deal. 
Your argument hints at introducing a fee market. Something like an order-book of reserve providers where they can choose for which fee they offer their reserves. Similar to providing insurance or lending markets e.g. on KuCoin.

Not sure where I hinted that, but it could actually be a good external contract in support of sigmausd. 
For example, RR=300%. Assume simultaneous minting is possible (I cant mint 1 sigusd, but I can mint 1 sigusd + 2 usd worth of RSV). 
Now, I want my 1 sigusd, but I dont want those RSVs. Maybe someone can mint for me, if I pay extra. 
In the external order book, someone would offer 1 sigusd for 1.1$ worth of ERG. Accepting offer would result in:
- 1 sigusd for buyer.
- 0.1$ worth of erg and 2$ worth of RSV for seller. 
- Sigmausd circulating supply goes up, RR stays same.

[03/25/2022 10:23 AM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
What do you think about that setup? I think its a good addition to the SIPs. 
Just needs the simultaneous minting, which probably is not possible without re-deployment.


[03/25/2022 10:24 AM] Gstoiti#0000
Yeah, I think it would be great

Enables trade in lock situations, which supports scaling sigmausd liquidity, and generates more fees for RSV holders. Great idea, unless I am missing something.

Send double the fee when redeeming if using nautilus/mobile wallet


[03/25/2022 9:54 PM] Fraser#0000
Oh interesting. Why is that?


[03/25/2022 9:55 PM] glasgowm#0000
It requires a second tx fee to send it on from the proxy contract. Yoroi just sends it higher by default


[03/25/2022 10:08 PM] Fraser#0000
Gotcha. So is there an exact amount to send?


[03/25/2022 10:15 PM] Jay#0000
Can't figure it out either, to redeem rsv on Android wallet we send 0.011 erg or 0.002 erg as the fee? Just tried it with 0.011 erg but had to use refund link


[03/25/2022 10:24 PM] Fraser#0000
I can get 0.02 to connect. But it still refunds every time. Just automatically


[03/25/2022 10:26 PM] Jay#0000
Wow so how do we actually redeem rsv then?


[03/25/2022 10:29 PM] Fraser#0000
No idea. Seems like it‚Äôs impossible to cash out right now. It just errors every time


[03/25/2022 10:32 PM] Jay#0000
What I'm not understanding is where does the redeemed erg come from, is it a separate tx sent some time after the RSV is sent to the proxy?


[03/25/2022 10:33 PM] Jay#0000
Because the proxy address always has a balance of 0 erg


[03/25/2022 10:40 PM] glasgowm#0000
You need 0.002 iirc, can also redeem via the Dex, ergomixer, or minotaur wallet

From the bank contract


[03/25/2022 10:52 PM] Jay#0000

You're also competing against bots arbitraging


[03/25/2022 10:55 PM] glasgowm#0000
Refund should be automatic in that case then though


[03/25/2022 10:58 PM] Jay#0000
Refund wasn't automatic but I'm guessing it's because the proxy needs to be sent 0.01 first


[03/25/2022 11:00 PM] glasgowm#0000

If using nautilus you just need to slide the fee slider iirc. Or add erg as an asset

Ok, so it's not exactly clear how much erg fee to send when redeeming RSV? But 0.1 erg should at least guarantee the transaction and receiving the redeemed erg


[03/25/2022 11:10 PM] glasgowm#0000
Unless someone else sends 0.11, yeh

Has anyone been able to redeem ? It‚Äôs just not happening & it looks as if I‚Äôm not the only one suffering.. @glasgowm why don‚Äôt u try a small qty & see if everything‚Äôs working ok, it can‚Äôt fail so many times, have been trying from last 8 hrs, Nautilus too returned failed

Ah, might‚Äôve missed a step now in telling you what to do now I look at Nautilus sorry. Send 0.02 erg + RSV + increase the fee slider

@anon_real what else could be blocking tx? doesn't seem to be many swaps on the bank so bots shouldn't be competing?

just to add to this, I've tried over 10 times to redeem sigUSD for Erg, all failed. Continuing to try though, but will use ErgoDex in the meantime


[04/05/2022 7:43 PM] T$ Global Depression CEO#0000
okay have tried like 50 times now :/


[04/05/2022 11:22 PM] T$ Global Depression CEO#0000
so far I've tried different SigUSD amounts, large and small, different ERG amounts, and different miner fee amounts. Probably had 30-40 attempts now and not having any luck


[04/05/2022 11:23 PM] T$ Global Depression CEO#0000
everything fails and gets returned immediately

Correct


[04/06/2022 1:49 AM] T$ Global Depression CEO#0000
I am using Nautilus to send to sigmausd.io


[04/06/2022 1:50 AM] T$ Global Depression CEO#0000
The dex works, but slippage is a problem


[04/06/2022 6:14 AM] expectederror#0000
> *(re @T$ Global Depression CEO)*: The dex works, but slippage is a problem 
Or arb bots overbidding the miners fee on your dex order/pool box. Slippage is not the only reason a dex order fails.


[04/06/2022 12:26 PM] tabhab2020#0000
Probably ErgoDex can deactivate/remove Sigmarsv & Sigmausd from there for 24 hrs, this will give us an idea if ErgoDex is the cause for failed transactions @Gazza_SP

See pinned message, the premiums are any losses SigUSD holders make (in erg). 

Since it acts like a long on the price of ERG + utilisation of SigmaUSD, the ROI for RSV is currently -12.48%

[04/13/2022 10:00 PM] nitram147#5106
Just my opinion:


[04/13/2022 10:00 PM] nitram147#5106
It would be better to let users to select their address (when using the nautilus option) - list all available addresses not only the latest derived one


[04/13/2022 10:00 PM] nitram147#5106
Same goes for available balance...


[04/13/2022 10:02 PM] nitram147#5106
In my case it just use the latest derived address (on which isn't any balance of course) and it renders nautilus option unusable even when on others addresses from the same wallet is enough balance...

It would be interesting if SigUSD has never depegged becuase that's what Djed is based on.

Good afternoon. Could you help me? changed SigRSV to Ergo last night. 2 transactions of 50.000 SigRSV stuck.
I tried to exchange for sigmausd.io and Ergodex. But I don‚Äôt really understand how to return them back, I tried to use the "refund" tab. my wallet is 9f1o2chjkzxWLen8zYdYuB5pAZqRjVxAvTyduFVgFfeaCCouLoD

Understanding Automated Market-Makers, Part 1: Price Impact
Every day, thousands of people use a decentralized exchange (DEX) for the first time. However, the idiosyncrasies of a public blockchain routinely catch newcomers off-guard, even those familiar with trading on more traditional venues. As a result, traders bleed money to arbitrageurs and frontrunners, leading to worse-than-necessary execution.

 It shouldn't make a difference, buying the tokens will have a cost, same as on a CEX with a market buy, if it's a big buy with low liquidity you will get less tokens than if it has huge liquidity

> expectederror re @Andrew: so I should just make multple small transactio... 
 
 it really depends on the price impact you‚Äòre having on the pool and if there are arbitrage bots at work. If you have an impact that would trigger an arb bot, then spreading it out makes sense, because there will likely be arbitrage trades between your orders that ultimately give you better prices for your subsequent orders.

Algostable $UST about -0.34% off peg with some rather large curve swaps starting to unbalance the pool. Be careful out there.

$UST forced itself into the majority of DeFi and crypto, so if it depegs >2% then the entire space is going to take a massive hit.

Summary  We propose a design for an extremely resilient decentralized algorithmic stablecoin. It has two major differences compared to the current stablecoins in the cryptomarket. First, no governance. Contrary to common intuition, relying on human judgement in a time of crisis is not a source of stability. Instead, a clear transparent code is s...

I would just like to point something out:
During the SigmaUSD bearwhale saga, WE, the community, banded together and defended the fair use of a decentralized protocol.  We won some battles and lost some as a community.  Lessons were learned.
Currently, Luna and UST bag holders are looking to DoKwon and LUNA foundation to bail them out.  I just hope those people realize they have alternatives.  IMO they‚Äôre missing the whole point of crypto.

Forwarded from Ile: Yesterday showed the strength of sigusd in holding peg. Its 1$, zero volatility.
Today we see the strength of its liquidity. Every other stablecoin will have problems providing liquidity to people mass panic selling. This is because they have collateral in assets that can't be sold immediately.
Sigmausd.io lets you exit sigusd whenever and as much as you like. Even the whole circulating supply. 100% liquid.
(External services will have problems if you want to exit erg after that, but that is out of the protocols scope.)

 Forwarded from unknown: I am not sure, but it seems best to me.
It would be good to list all ideas, and look at pros and cons for them. 
Dynamic fees are great too. They can be used to push the ratio toward 600%. I feel like market forces alone might most often arrive at the corners. The dynamic fees wont stop locking actions though.
What is so promising in simultaneous minting, is that it allows markets to define the fees dynamically. Sigmabank remains always on peg, but the external market can find a price, where people are willing to mint more. That additional minting cant be achieved with dynamic fees. That additional minting adds fees to reserves, and allows the TVL to scale even at <400% RR.


[05/16/2022 12:43 PM] glasgowm#0000
Forwarded from unknown: The SIPs that I remember of the top off my head are:
- dynamic fees (many versions).
- simultaneous minting.
- non-matching lock %. E.g. mint usd until 500%, cant sell rsv at 400%.
- circuit breakers (max amount of mint per block)
- Djed paper had some ideas.

 NFA.
SigUSD has liquidity issues. Currently only available on Ergodex, and the price can be off from exchange prices. I prefer using it, if I am looking to buy/sell ERG. Just make sure the price is good. 
For everything else, sigUSD is not available. Then I prefer USDC. Sometimes it doesn't have liquidity on exchanges, and then it is USDT.

 You can use the djed whitepaper https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1069.pdf
SigmaUSD is an implementation of minimal djed (see page 25).

Just started taking a look at the app for SigmaUSD, before I try interacting with it.
Question: purchase (minting) of sigUSD and redemption (burning) of sigRSV are not currently allowed based on current Reserve status (315%). 
This is by design of course (very cool!), but is this a typical state for it to be in at the moment?
Reserve providers don‚Äôt feel incentivised?

 Market dipped recently. People will probably provide reserves (and redeem stablecoins) when they think price will increase. I guess we are still too close to the crash, but people will gain confidence again after some time.
But yes, it is typical. If price is decreasing (last 9 months) reserve ratio is close to or below 400%.


[05/17/2022 11:46 PM] miwall#0000
Does anyone have any thoughts on Reserve Protocol as a comparison to SigmaUSD?
They seem already to be processing a lot of payments, so that‚Äôs in their favour, but their equivalent of SigRSV is what they call a ‚Äúrights token‚Äù. Right now that has no purpose, but the idea is, just talk at the moment, that rights token can be staked in order to provide ‚Äúinsurance‚Äù.
But sigmaUSD seems to have just built it properly from the start.
(with a central bank like model)
(The one thing reserve has in their favour is it they seem to be taking a lot of payments already in Latin America- But learning about sigUSD makes me realise a large part of reserve protocol‚Äôs ‚Äúproposition‚Äù (re. its token) is just future promises!)
also that investing in their rights token looks very much to me like an equity investment in those people, (and vcs - yuck) which is a totally different proposition from buying some ergs! 
context, (confession) - I bought some of that when I was a complete beginner in crypto, and wondering whether to buy a bit more now that it‚Äôs down 95%.  also to understand what they‚Äôre doing of course. My main massive takeaway right now, is there are VCs involved in that project, and I smell a rat.
Nevin Freeman is an articulate  guy, but if you look at what he and insiders are making, that‚Äôs a central part of the story.
Not proud of talking about the investment aspects here, but I suppose that‚Äôs part of the human story in crypto too.

 will there be a situation that all the erg reserves are exhausted by sigUSD redemption due to the erg price down?


[05/18/2022 1:37 AM] cardelayno#0000
if you look at the graphic you can't mint more sigusd under 400% ratio
when people redeem it cause collateral ratio to go up.


[05/18/2022 1:38 AM] cardelayno#0000
if the price of erg go low enough the ratio can go below 100% which means unpegged from $1. but there are certain things that help against this

[05/18/2022 1:40 AM] cardelayno#0000
aside from above, people can buy more reserve tokens 
the price of erg in the protocol can only move a tiny percentage every 10 minutes. people can see the reserve ratio.  it give they time to take action.


[05/18/2022 1:42 AM] cardelayno#0000
sigrsv/shen is like holding shares of the treasury. if more demand for sigusd/djed, then people have to deposit more erg or ada which grows the treasury and make your rsv worth more.  the opposite is true too. so incentive is to create use case and demands for sigusd/djed

(re @cardelayno : *aside from above, people can buy more reserve tokens

 so the erg oracle price of this protocol also biased from the cex or anywhere else?


[05/18/2022 1:43 AM] cardelayno#0000
some people argue this isn't enough. as reserve token holders you are taking the risk to stabilize the stable coin.
i like to see more incentives  built too.

 so when the reserves drop, one can get more shares using the same amount of usd value?


[05/18/2022 1:44 AM] cardelayno#0000

[05/18/2022 1:54 AM] cardelayno#0000
just remember it's not solely based on erg or ada price


[05/18/2022 1:55 AM] cardelayno#0000
you could enter at the wrong time and when price go up yet your rsv or shen is worth less.


[05/18/2022 1:55 AM] HilooooYah#0000
so as soon as you believe that the sigusd will again reused or pegged and erg or ada's price will again restore, sigrsv deserves your buy


[05/18/2022 1:55 AM] cardelayno#0000
best time is probably when reserve ratio is lower. but you also take the risk that you can not redeem until 400% or higher


[05/18/2022 1:55 AM] cardelayno#0000
but you can still trade it on the dex or provide liquidity


[05/18/2022 1:56 AM] cardelayno#0000
now if someone create side incentive for circulating rsv or shen, maybe that will create more desire to hold it


[05/18/2022 1:57 AM] cardelayno#0000
sigusd has always been pegged


[05/18/2022 1:57 AM] cardelayno#0000
it has never been unpegged from $1.0000 for the entire year of its existence


[05/18/2022 2:04 AM] cardelayno#0000
but note that the value of sigusd on ergodex is not based on oracle price.  that is based on the amm liquidity pool.


[05/18/2022 2:06 AM] cardelayno#0000
because of low liquidity there is a bit of arbitrage going on

[05/18/2022 11:13 AM] miwall#0000
I‚Äôve come up with a way to compare SigmaUSD to the Reserve Protocol I was talking about. (an active stablecoin in latam, with 600k users via an app; they have a reserve token and the stable itself, but the two aren‚Äôt actually linked yet ‚Äì they are delaying decentralisation until they ‚Äúmake up their minds‚Äù on what design to actually commit to). 
The comparison -
Imagine if by design SigmaUSD had a built in option to double the number of reserve tokens, to use for ‚Äúecosystem development‚Äù (i.e. marketing and branding). 
That‚Äôs essentially reserve protocol - and without a dao to govern it. 
(They also pre-mind their equity-like tokens, and handed them out at different prices, including to VCs. Whereas, the ‚Äúequity raise‚Äú which sigUSD does, seems much more equitable, as well as decentralised; puts up a nice defensive wall against inroads from traditional finance.) 
I see pluses and minuses of the presence of a huge marketing warchest / elephant gun - depends on what kind of battles you want to fight. (there‚Äôs also the massive issue of whether incentives are aligned with vcs. I would not be optimistic about that on average). 
So, sigUSD looks like a great project, I‚Äôd rather be here than there I think. (but i try to keep an open mind too, and listen to other approaches).


[05/18/2022 11:45 AM] miwall#0000
More concisely - sigUSD is cleaner, simpler, because an ICO, (aka pre-mine) (which it does not do) involves a compromise on principles and creates extra complexity. This is sigUSD advantage?

(re @miwall : *More concisely - sigUSD is cleaner, simpler, because an ICO, (aka pre-mine) (which it does not do) involves a compromise on principles and creates extra complexity. This is sigUSD advantage?*) 
 
 I would say so, yes. 
Marketing/improving budget means governance and people expecting team to deliver. A protocol owned by no-one can inspire community to contribute in those. (This is not yet the case for sigmausd, but it is the aim. Some community members hold governance multisig, which has not been used so far.)
Also, if you read Ergo manifesto, you can see that Ergo and some projects in it are aimed at providing equal access to finance. Giving privlidges to early investors or VCs might be negative for marketing, if a project wants to keep up that image.


[05/18/2022 3:49 PM] nitram147#5106
That would be always the case. There's simple reason for it. Easiest way to back for example 10 million stablecoins would be to have 10 million dollars in the bank (real bank) - that's it, really simple and stable design (because dollars backing would be always worth dollars). If you want to have good algorithmic stablecoin it need to be backed by some onchain asset (to be really decentralized and not dependent on the external world so much), and it has to be heavily over-collateralized to be able to withstand heavy market crashes.

Let's have an example. If you wanted to have big marketcap stablecoin such as tether (USDT) right now, it would mean that with 800% collateralization you would need to back it by 592 billions dollars worth of onchain asset - which is more than the whole marketcap of bitcoin right now.

 This is why you need different models of stable coin. sigUSD is sound, good for long term (we think). Others might be easier to use for short term trading (dexy)

(re  : *<nitram147> That's the reason why the big marketcap stablecoin will always be centralized üôÇ*) 
 
 So because of relative paucity of total market cap of crypto (no tokenised real estate, for example), we simply don‚Äôt have access to enough collateral to fully back the total current net demand for stable assets/stable coins with onchain assets. QED. Good point.
Wonder if/when this might change.

(re @miwall : *So if SigUSD faces high demand, that pushes up the price of Erg?

 Indirectly. To mint SigUSD you have to buy ERG & lock it in the smart contract. You can also buy SigUSD on ErgoDex but the amout of liquidity there is capped naturally.

(re @question86 : *Indirectly. To mint SigUSD you have to buy ERG & lock it in the smart contract. You can also buy SigUSD on ErgoDex but the amout of liquidity there is capped naturally.*) 
 
 If the incentives would be working right, then higher sigusd demand --> higher incentive to mint sigrsv --> more erg tied --> higher erg price.
I dont see how the scale would be capped by a single collateral. 
(Those incentives are not working perfectly yet)


[05/18/2022 5:32 PM] question86#0000
The liquidity on SigUSD on ErgoDex is capped due to the fact that these SigUSD have to be minted on sigmausd.io first. As long as there is a incentive to not burn these sigusd on sigmausd.io but use them within the ecosystem, minting sigrsv will become more attractive. But SigRSV holders are still suffering from the initial event when there was no maximum within the RR for minting sigrsv.. epochal overshoot of ergo liquidity compared to demand in sigusd at this point.

 So, instead of burning sigUSD, let markets make more to meet the demand. At a premium it sees fit

 I tend to favor dynamic fees. But simultaneous minting is also interesting.

[05/18/2022 6:13 PM] Armeanio#0000
The downside to dynamic fees is the potential for dilution vs adding to the reserve so even that is a hard decision.


[05/18/2022 6:14 PM] Armeanio#0000
But it does create an incentive just hard to want to change the game after it has started. Since it negatively effects someone.


[05/18/2022 6:30 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
Both of them increase usage by always allowing arb.
Both of them create more fees through that usage. Dynamic fees might create even more, depending on the structure. 
I feel like simultaneous minting might encourage scaling more. Also, the markets are more flexible in finding the right price, than the arbitrary fee structure.


[05/18/2022 6:33 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
I wonder if it needs simultaneous burning too. Maybe some rsv bag holders are frustrated enough to go buy sigUSD for getting rid of them ü§î

(re @Armeanio : *Idk what the actual implementation would look like though. ü§î*) 
 
 Send erg, get back sigusd and rsv in the correct ratio. 
What would the dynamic fee look like? You see some numbers on current situation in sigmausd.io, but the tx order matters. So a slippage is needed?

 Depends when they entered. When they exit. RSV holders are not on the same team. They are trading against each other.

 With lots of minting, sure.

In theory though if someone minted rsv when erg was 10 they could be whole if erg was lower with fees, etc over time

Probably not now obviously but at what price would that be more likely? I guess I'm just trying to give some hope to the rsv guys as now that the ecosystem is starting to turn on for ergo were probably going to see sigUSD utilized more

 Yeah. The calculators are hard. I made one of the early ones. 
The reason is that the rsv profit/loss does not only depend on your entry and exit. It also depends on everyone else entering and exiting inbetween. That is impossible to put in a calculator, and very difficult to predict too.

(re @scotman8888 : *In theory though if someone minted rsv when erg was 10 they could be whole if erg was lower with fees, etc over time*) 
 
 Fees are too small to have this big of an impact realistically. But if we go a few times up and down again and stablecoin holders trade at a loss (mint low, redeem high) with large volume, then rsv holders could be whole without erg getting back to their entry price.

How does this reduce the reserve ratio?

My understanding is that to Mint 100 sigusd (minus fees), I have to depit 100 sigusd worth of ERG.

Since the amount I'm putting in is slightly less than the amount I'm getting out are (because of fees), wouldn't reserve ratio slightly increase?


[05/21/2022 11:26 AM] scotman8888#0000
Dynamic fees are a great idea, the hard part is getting the game theory right. 50% fee is robbery though if someone isn't paying attention. I think all we need to do is just raise it a tiny bit like 4% max


[05/21/2022 11:26 AM] scotman8888#0000
Im worried that with pressure on the market in general we could be at 200-500 ratio for a long time

If the ratio is at 450 for months, we might discourage use of the contract at all


[05/21/2022 11:26 AM] scotman8888#0000
In fact, now that I think about it, probably all we really need is to lower the fee to 1% if ratio is below 400 for reserve and increase the fee to mint usd by 1% if ratio is below 500


[05/21/2022 11:26 AM] scotman8888#0000

 Yeah. I lean to agreeing with this. The idea with 50%+ is to avoid contract locking by max minting. But 50% is quite extreme.

Maker just added USDC as DAI collateral

Trusted collateral was part of multi-collateral DAI, so not a surprise

"Maker is no longer trustless!"

Not quite, but it's less trustless than before

Trustless exists on a spectrum

Allow minting sigusd and rsv in current ratio in one tx at any rr. For example, at 300%rr I send 4 erg (+0.08 fee) to sigmabank, and I get 1 erg worth of sigusd and 3 erg worth of rsv. 
(This could be combined with a less aggressive set of dynamic fees, to get the push toward a balanced target like 500%rr.)

By not having the contract lock once the reserve ratio drops below 400 opens the door to manipulation. It's not probable but it could happen let's say we're close to 100 and price of erg is dropping a big mint might destabilize things

 Yeah, but he could only mint SigUSD if he also mints SigRSV. That wouldn't decrease the reserve ratio, actually, it would increase it (if we require to provide at least 4 Erg per 1 Erg SigUSD, more if reserve ratio is above 400%, but nobody would do it in this case, since one could mint the normal way)

(re @Gstoiti : *Basically, he would provide his own reserves and get SigUSD and SigRSV.*) 
 
 I guess I just get nervous about lowering the floor. Technically there's nothing stopping anyone from minting a million dollars of sigUSD right now all they need to do is buy enough sigRSV to get the ratio above 400, then sequentially buy sigRSV and sigUSD until they get to the number they want, so it's sort of the same thing as simultaneous minting as the end game is a net positive investment in rsv to bring ratio up to 400 and the fees


[05/21/2022 5:55 PM] scotman8888#0000
Still feels like I'm missing something though


[05/21/2022 6:00 PM] Gstoiti#0000
This person would need to bring the reserve ratio back to 400% first. So he needs to buy huge amounts of SigRSV. 1.) Only whales can do that. Simultaneous minting would allow small fish to mint SigUSD below 400%.
2.) There might be a point (high circulating supply of SigUSD) at which even whales couldn't mint enough SigRSV to get back to 400%.
3.) It will be a battle of bots at 400% reserve ratio. Many would exit SigRSV, so he would need to mint even more SigRSV before being able to mint SigUSD.

 I was trying to think too, but did not come up with exploits so far. 
Whale minting at low rr would not hurt. The rr stays same, or a bit higher due to fees.
Pumping rr above 400% to take advantage of arb is too risky. Simultaneous mint would allow arb at a premium that the market decides.
A practical example would be that I want sigusd now, and you want sigrsv. You could simultaneous mint, and offer me sigusd with premium

 We could even require to allow simultanuous minting only with a ratio of max(400%, current reserve ratio). Then simultanuous minting would increase the reserve ratio (below 400%) even without fees.

[05/21/2022 6:42 PM] Gstoiti#0000
(re @Ile : *What is the problem having it open always?*) 
 
 I meant below reserve ratio of 400%, e.g. 200%, people should only be able to mint 1 erg SigUSD with 3 erg SigRSV (-> 4 erg to reserves, so internal reserve ratio of this mint = 400%) and not 1 erg SigUSD with 1 erg SigRSV (-> 2 erg to reserves, so mint reserve ratio = current reserve ratio = 200%).

 Question for ya, buddy. Why wouldnt this work to improve the capital efficiency problem: simply skew the sigUSD protocol towards buying from the protocol and selling on the dex rather than burning in the protocol. For example, reduce the minting fee by 90% and increase the redemption fee by just as much. That way it is cheaper to mint sigUSD than buy on a dex, but cheaper to sell on a dex than burn with the protocol.


[06/02/2022 1:58 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000

 What happens if there is not enough demand for SigUSD? Price on the dex would drop and SigUSD lose its peg. The new peg would basically be 1$-redemption fee, because if the price on the dex would be cheaper than that, people would buy on dex and redeem.


[06/02/2022 7:12 AM] Gstoiti#0000
One can't permanently make redeeming more expensive than selling on a dex, because bots will arbitrage the difference away. The price on the dex will adapt.


[06/02/2022 7:18 AM] Gstoiti#0000
The price on the dex will always be (as long as arbitrage happens) in the interval [redemption value, minting costs].

(re @Gstoiti : *The price on the dex will always be (as long as arbitrage happens) in the interval [redemption value, minting costs].*) 
 
 The upper bound holds as long as reserve ratio >=400% (minting of SigUSD is possible) and the lower bound should hold always.

 How much would the redemption fee be then? 4%?

Piling on what @Gstoiti said, that would effectively make the peg 0.96 instead of current 0.98. 

The peg is measured from the place of most liquidity. Sigmabank in our casr.


[06/02/2022 8:00 AM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
Different buy/sell fees are good to think about though. Dynamic fees kinda do this too. 

Not sure what setup would be best for capital efficiency in mind. That is affected by three things, CR, fees and usage. 

Imo CR should be higher than markets want (debatable if 400% is too high or not). Fees and usage affect eachother, especially when ecosystem develops,  which makes optimization tricky.


[06/02/2022 8:16 AM] Gstoiti#0000

 Frax is one of the better stablecoin projects. Very innovative, and pushing the "basket of goods as peg" idea too. 

But, I think they fail on the decentralization part. Currently it is mostly backed by USDC. Why take the extra risk?

Also, they just demonstrated how the governance can go badly wrong. They voted to jump into a big curve pool with UST just before it crashed. They did not have time to execute that decision before, which saved them. 

Such gov systems are on the path of commercial banks turning into central banks. Not stable imo.

Even though I dont like it, realistically I predict that such stablecoins will do good in the future.

Overcollateralized + active management of the underlying reserves.


[06/05/2022 1:58 PM] scotman8888#0000
That's basically DAI

Its sort of cheating if a decentralized stable coin uses dollars in a bank as the reserve

(re @scotman8888 : *That's basically DAI*) 
 
 DAI is just collateralized debt positions. (Also mostly USDC)

FRAX has a mix of USDC + other collateral + their own token. But I think its not CDP. Lately they announced to go more into CDP direction though... So hard to keep track.


[06/05/2022 2:05 PM] scotman8888#0000

 How? 

If usdc is centralized, and most dai is backed by usdc, then how is it more decentralized?


[06/05/2022 2:15 PM] scotman8888#0000
DAI governance have the option to use something else at some point, and technically the individuals holding the token can't get rugged or tracked individually by circle


[06/05/2022 2:15 PM] scotman8888#0000
For example they could use djed or sigUSD instead of usdc at any point going forward

 Good point. From individual point of view, that is a selling point.

From protocol point of view, you rely on USDC letting you operate. (Unless they change in the future)

 Well, you also get extra risk on top. USDC might break trust and gamble the money, or get shut down by regulators.

DAI relies on liquidators doing the right thing in case of a crash, and peg holding in main exchanges of liquidity. And smart contracts of course.


[06/05/2022 2:21 PM] scotman8888#0000
Yeah, it's a mess. I feel they lost their way after the 2020 crash and never really fixed the original flaws which is how I ended up finding ageusd

 They had their liquidation problems too. 

I am still quite uneasy about trusting external liquidators keeping up the platform. Sigmausd feel way more robust because it doesnt rely on people doing the right thing.

@Armeanio , could you expand on this? What is the downside of integrating sigusd outside of Ergo ecosystem? 

I see this more as a risk for those stablecoins that are backed with interconnected coins. 

Or if the protocol relies on having main liquidity in some external service.

But with sigmausd, the collateral is erg only, and main liquidity (arbed against) is always going to be the sigmabank.

What am I missing?

 External trades require order book maintenence to maintain a pair.

This has to do with depth or the threshold that can be traded before the pair itself starts to slip. 

As far as I know there is no known decentralized way to do this as it requires an account on an exchange as well as a trading API (this can be set without withdrawl functionality)


[06/13/2022 9:42 PM] Armeanio#0000
So some actor would ultimately need to be behind the curtain maintaining liquidity.


[06/13/2022 9:43 PM] Armeanio#0000
It potentially gives them an advantage knowing when the pair would slip (which they could profit off of potentially) it also puts us within the trade requirements of the exchange itself.


[06/13/2022 9:43 PM] Armeanio#0000
A lot of complexity for listing a stablecoin on an exchange, it really does not favor decentralization in any way.


[06/13/2022 9:46 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
(re @Armeanio : *A lot of complexity for listing a stablecoin on an exchange, it really does not favor decentralization in any way.*) 
 
 Ok. I see. But you are talking about CEX, right? 

The quote talks about "move beyond the ecosystem". So, a DEX on Cardano could adopt sigusd without those problems, or?

Also, if a CEX would play by the same rules, then they could too?


[06/13/2022 9:46 PM] Armeanio#0000
We inherit a lot of external risk and liability with a Cex listing. With no real way to address those in a decentralized way.


[06/13/2022 9:47 PM] Armeanio#0000
I think even in Cardano it would make more sense to create some type of AgeUSD Alliance to Lock and swap SigUSD on ERG to Djed on Cardano. So a user always in within the ecosystem of the bank contract.


[06/13/2022 9:47 PM] Armeanio#0000
Personally I favor a Swap Vs a Wrap it keeps the user with the best assumptions

(re @Armeanio : *It potentially gives them an advantage knowing when the pair would slip (which they could profit off of potentially) it also puts us within the trade requirements of the exchange itself.*) 
 
 They could profit off their customers, but not manipulate the sigmabank, right?

That could only be done by manipulating erg price. Which always remains a risk.


[06/13/2022 9:50 PM] Armeanio#0000
(re @Ile : *They could profit off their customers, but not manipulate the sigmabank, right?

 An actor could profit of the customers potentially and have some negative effects on ERG pricing if it got big enough. Bearwhale attack but probably more a grinding thing vs just the fast dump we saw in the past.


[06/13/2022 9:50 PM] Armeanio#0000
I dont understand why it is a good idea to inherit risks beyond the protocol with these instruments.


[06/13/2022 9:51 PM] Armeanio#0000
CEX listing and leaving the ecosystem in general has its tradeoffs, since you leave the network where the general assumptions of the framework exist

(re @Armeanio : *Personally I favor a Swap Vs a Wrap it keeps the user with the best assumptions*) 
 
 Yeah. I see, and agree. So conditioned to think one solution should grow and overtake others.

Containing a protocol within the ecosystem is definitely more resilient. Having multiple protocol implementations is also more resilient. 

Just less convenient, but so is decentralization.


[06/13/2022 9:53 PM] Armeanio#0000
Yeah it is hard because most people have been conditioned to chase leverage and liquidity.


[06/13/2022 9:53 PM] Armeanio#0000
Which is not so transparent on exchanges anyway


[06/13/2022 9:54 PM] Armeanio#0000
Any central exchange is essentially a black box unknown assumptions, unknown levels of control.


[06/13/2022 9:55 PM] Armeanio#0000
Do exchanges trade against their customers on both spot and futures, track liquidity inflows/outflows.. futures positions and liquidation thresholds etc. I would imagine so tbh.

(re @Armeanio : *An actor could profit of the customers potentially and have some negative effects on ERG pricing if it got big enough. Bearwhale attack but probably more a grinding thing vs just the fast dump we saw in the past.*) 
 
 High collateral ratio kinda puts a cap on the sigusd circulation. It cant be more than erg mcap. 

People were giving this as a weakness of a single backing asset. 

Makes perfect sense to me...


[06/13/2022 9:56 PM] Armeanio#0000
We have a few examples recently of the unwind what can happen when a core asset can't back a stablecoin.


[06/13/2022 9:56 PM] Armeanio#0000
Its much better to build on the concept of hard money vs fractional reserves


[06/13/2022 9:57 PM] Armeanio#0000
That is the nonesense I thought these systems were trying to get away from.


[06/13/2022 9:57 PM] Armeanio#0000
But with hard money the level of debt/collateralization cant exist that offers the sexiest yields.


[06/13/2022 9:59 PM] Armeanio#0000
Money Markets Pay what 2% 3% on a 10 year... UST was what 20%, USDD 40% that itself is a bit insane.

Its not great for external liquidity but it is for security assumptions.

Nice discussion ongoing here, just wanted to add that imo in general its always healthy for a product (sigusd in this case) to participate in the biggest market possible because thats exactly the best way to prevent manipulation. But the timeframe is important, right now ergos market share is too small to be resilient to manipulation and probably this wont change anytime soon. I think its unquestioned that holding SigUSD feels "better" than holding e.g. Tether or also DAI for a mix of reasons, therefore SigUSD potentially will attract and steal more value from its competitors. The community should think of ways to leverage this technological advantage without exposing the whole ecosystem to speculation.

 I dont agree it is always healthy. If there is a way to profit from manipulation, the size wont matter. 

I would rather focus on defining health metrics that are relative to the size. The best one would be real world usage realtive to size, but that would be very difficult to know, and even more difficult to monitor in a decentralized way.

 These concerns will become real in defi without CEXes too. 

As more defi puzzle pieces come together, it will be increasingly difficult to avoid manipulation across the whole set. 

Still long way to become a concern in Ergo, but Ethereum defi is definitely grappling with the issues arising from composability already. Those issues will only increase.

So this will shift focus from internal protocol security/stability to also foreseeing and preparing for external threats. That is really difficult. 

You bringing up the CEX issues, is showing more anticipation of such issues than I have seen elsewhere üëè.

 Prediction markets maybe. But only if there are many small protocols, instead of few big.

Predicting few big in a rapidly changing world is impossible. There is not enough data points. This is why continuous centralization cant work. 

Data is needed to make those predictions, and without it, you are just relying on theory from experts. That fails certainly sooner or later.

Hi guys. 
I'm trying to understand SigUSD V2 smart contract's "Bank Script".
From this read, https://www.ergoforum.org/t/sigusd-v-2-0-launch/912, I see 5 NFT holders have the voting rights.
From my attempt of understanding "Bank Script", this allows moving V2 fund to a new address if the NFT holder wishes to, am I correct?
Also, how does the "Ballot Script" and "Bank Script" work together?


[06/15/2022 7:14 AM] Andrew#0000

From reading the code again, it seems "updateNFT" and "bankNFT" are more like Cardano's redeemer to specify which operation needs to be executed.


[06/15/2022 8:27 PM] glasgowm#0000
Not sure what you‚Äôre asking, bankNFT is a NFT that identifies the bank proxy contract so it cant be imitated, updateNFT is the governance token allowing the bank to be changed


[06/15/2022 11:38 PM] Andrew#0000
val properBank = OUTPUTS(0).tokens(2)._1 == fromBase64("$bankNFT") // the real bank box of the sigmaUSD protocol must be used so not any random person can behave as the bank box

I found a comment on "bankNFT" and now I understand that NFT is used to represent the source of truth.  
So, for SigUSD, does a single EUTXO bank box exist to store SigUSD state similar to Ethereum's account model style?

Thanks for all the clarification @glasgowm by the way!


[06/15/2022 11:44 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
It is always a single box, yes. But it is only one part of the state, the other is the oracle rate box


[06/15/2022 11:48 PM] Andrew#0000
Thank you @MrStahlfelge 
I know, on Cardano, single box Account style smart contracts have a performance bottleneck since an EUTXO output can only be utilized once in a single block time since an EUTXO can be consumed only once.
How does Ergo handle this performance bottleneck? On Cardano, they tend to batch bunch of EUTXO inputs and interact with the "bank box" once a block time.

[06/16/2022 5:10 PM] Andrew#0000
Can it even depeg


[06/16/2022 5:13 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
reserve ratio is 356% now, it can depeg if ergo price is 1/3.56th from current price if no one mints sigrsv in the meantime


[06/16/2022 5:14 PM] Andrew#0000
That‚Äôs what, roughly 28% lower?


[06/16/2022 5:19 PM] glasgowm#0000
The incentives work pretty well, even without anyone minting people still withdraw sigUSD


[06/16/2022 5:19 PM] glasgowm#0000
Think the lowest it's got is like 240% RR


[06/16/2022 5:22 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
(re @Andrew : *That‚Äôs what, roughly 28% lower?*) 
 
 1/3.56=0.28 => 72% lower

We can't believe that a project called Magic Internet Money has been acting irresponsibly either.

After years of studying it, I believe that cryptocurrency is an inherently right-wing, hyper-capitalistic technology built primarily to amplify the wealth of its proponents through a combination of tax avoidance, diminished regulatory oversight and artificially enforced scarcity.

The price of USDT reported by @fluxprotocol oracle's @Amberdataio data provider was inaccurate for around 2 minutes which lead to liquidations.

In response, we hardcoded the price of USDT to 1 for now, are working to track all affected users and provide further details.

79% of DAI is now backed solely by centralized stablecoins like USDC & USDT. This is an ATH.

This price crash is turning DAI into a wrapper for these centralized stables, which were added as collateral to stabilize the peg during high market volatility.

Charles makes a pretty good point here. Djed is essentially the same as sigusd. But cardanos approach is to have protocols like coti deploy it so that if it fails the chain doesn‚Äôt go down with it

you need an ErgoPay compatible wallet installed on your system. If you are on desktop, easiest is to scan the QR code with the mobile wallet. if you use TokenJay on mobile, scanning the own screen is not possible - so you need the button.

 SigRSV on ErgoDEX will follow the sigmaUSD bank as close as possible as there are bots trading between both for profit by arbritage, so if sigRSV gains value from fees on sigmaUSD site it will reflect on ErgoDEX also!

 I would definitely learn more about it before investing. 

A simplified example, you put 100erg and 174300 rsv (worth 100erg atm) into liquidity pool. Now the reserves increase by 1%. 

You still have 100erg and 174300rsv in the pool, but those rsv are worth 101erg. 

In reality, there are many other things that affect the prices.

 Yeah, I meant possible right after it reaches 400%. As Glasgow said, arbitrage bots for Ergodex will probably bring it down to exactly 400% right after it hit more than 400%.

If they burn it the bank is unaffected. If they redeem it for erg, the ratio goes up yeh.

Some sigusd and rsv are going to be burned and forgotten in lost wallets over time. Or do those then become part of the storage rent? Interesting to think how that would affect the sigmabank.

[06/23/2022 5:01 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
This made me think of an addition to SIPs. 

I have been arguing for removing humans from the collateral provision side. What if a small part of the fees would be used to buy rsv, which would never be redeemed?

That would reduce the rsv holder yield, but make it safer for them to exit. It would make the protocol more stable in general, when part of the collateral would not chase higher yield or escape in crash. 

If it would accumulate big part of collateral, like 700%, then human collateral providers might be discouraged to buy rsv altogether. In case of a crash, and small rr like 200%, they might be interested to join again. 

Any thoughts?

[06/28/2022 12:36 PM] Vesi Hiisi#2550
<Bruno> Vesi Hiisi, this is an interesting idea. I think it would be worth trying.  

When I was developing the Djed protocol, I wanted to minimize the number of coins and I tried to think of ways of getting rid of reservecoins (a.k.a. RSV). An idea similar to the one you described came to my mind: just having stablecoins and letting the fees from buying and selling stablecoins accumulate in the reserve; if we were lucky (i.e. no market crashes in the beginning), the protocol could operate long enough to attain a reserve ratio sufficiently greater than 1. 

The main problem (Problem #1) is precisely that this depends on luck. If a market crash happened in the beginning, the peg would be lost. Knowing this, people would be reluctant to buy stablecoins in the beginning. It is a bit of a cold start problem.  

Another problem (Problem #2) is who would own the reserve surplus. For instance, if everyone redeemed their stablecoins, the reserve surplus would be locked in the contract forever.

Due to problems like this, I gave up on that idea and decided that it would be simpler to keep reservecoins.

But your idea is a bit different. It is not affected by problem #1. But note that it is still affected by problem #2. If everyone redeems all stablecoin and all reservecoins, who will own the remaining surplus reserve?   It is not a difficult problem. There might be many interesting ways to answer this question. But probably these answers will lead to a protocol that is less minimal than the Minimal Djed.

 Maybe it is possible to modify the design so that the reserve surplus goes back into circulation through storage rent? One could even think of creating multiple reserve depots and using e.g. first in first out to control the storage rent collection a bit. 

If the reserve surplus would be slowly drained via storage rent, then
i) coins would not be stuck in the reserve forever and
ii) the whole ecosystem would benefit through incentivising miners.


[06/28/2022 1:39 PM] Vesi Hiisi#2550
""The main problem (Problem #1) is precisely that this depends on luck""

Here are two options to initiate it. A) sell stablecoin and put proceeds into collateral. If collateral price goes down, then reserve ratio is <100%. If price goes up, the protocol might get away with it. Depends on luck as you say.

B) My proposal does not depend on luck, as you noted. However, it introduces the problem of slowly accumulating liquidity. The proposed solution is to use funds that are intended for public goods (e.g. catalyst) or community effort. Slow to start, but even less luck needed than sigmausd needs in general.

""Another problem (Problem #2) is who would own the reserve surplus.""

No one. Or the protocol itself. I don't think this is a problem. The fact that no-one can touch it adds to the reliability. If everyone cashes out their stablecoin, then service for others to mint is available. Just as intended.

It was to this hybrid idea that I was referring in my reply. (I haven't seen your previous ideas.) As I said, I think it is a very interesting idea worth trying. The hybridization solves problem #1. Problem #2 still exists. I understand your point that you don't think this is a problem. And indeed it is not a serious problem. But I still find it inelegant to have a remaining surplus reserve that cannot be withdrawn from the contract when all the stablecoins are redeemed (or when the reserve ratio becomes too large).

Something like storage rent is a good idea to solve problem #2. I like it.

I also like the idea of using public good funds to bootstrap an initial reserve, thereby solving problem #1 without needing reservecoins.


[06/28/2022 3:11 PM] Bruno#5958
Vesi Hiisi, this discussion also reminds me of FEI's notion of "protocol controlled value"...

I will read your post (https://www.ergoforum.org/t/a-proposal-for-a-public-good-stablecoin/3432) in more detail later.


[06/28/2022 3:28 PM] Vesi Hiisi#2550
The storage rent is a great idea in case the protocol fails, and money gets stuck. Also, it could be seen as a way for the public good to pay back the initial support by strengthening the blockchain security when reserves are very high.

Alternatively, if reserves become really high, like >1200%, the fees could be automatically lowered.

This would make the protocol a clear winner among stablecoins. 
- higher collateral ratio than anyone else.
- lower fees than anyone else.
- full circulating supply available for withdrawal immediately.
- all data fully transparent on-chain.

In my view, if such snowball gets going, it would be really difficult to compete against.


[06/28/2022 3:33 PM] Vesi Hiisi#2550
I think the protocol owned value model is where the decentralized stablecoin systems are headed. 

It has a huge advantage in that they can put the treasury into generating yield. However, someone has to manage those allocations. 

You will see in the forum post why I am opposed to this. Tldr, human management is not stable, and they overextend risk, and it is a path to central banking.

Unfortunately, these will market themselves harder than a public good, where no one is making a profit.

I have been told that the country-based restriction of some operations will be implemented only in the frontend and/or in the off-chain code. The contracts themselves will not have any restriction. So, someone who could interact directly with the contract or through some alternative frontend could circumvent the restrictions.

(I am not directly involved in the implementation. Therefore, I don't know this for sure.)

The criminal mafia which calls itself state of Z√ºrich/ Switzerland ows me like 200k and I cannot keep cash or similar. I had to sell even my Oli Stock before it went to 50x. Obsidisan Energy.

 Perhaps I am thinking from an American perspective. Stock market here is easy to access and secure. Not the case in other countries, and I can see how Solana could be attractive. However, I just think there are better options for defi and more will continue to develop

(re @odiseus_me : *Is there anywhere a tool that can help us understand - if one bought X SigRSV at a certain date - how much she stands to gain or lose - if she redeems that amount today?*) 
 
 Nope, because people entering and exiting sigUSD change what the returns are and you can't predict that


[07/26/2022 10:28 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
It's impossible to predict sigRSV returns


[07/26/2022 10:28 AM] Gstoiti#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *without keeping a spreadsheet updated with all amounts bought plus costs plus dates etc...*) 
 
 So you want something that reads your wallet transactions automatically? Because all those informations (amount, price) are needed.


[07/26/2022 10:28 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
Unless you knew every person that was going to enter and exit sigRSV and sigUSD after your entry


[07/26/2022 10:30 AM] Gstoiti#0000
(re @Gstoiti : *So you want something that reads your wallet transactions automatically? Because all those informations (amount, price) are needed.*) 
 
 I think it could be included in the sigmausd website, since it already stores transaction history and has all information needed


[07/26/2022 11:07 AM] odiseus_me#0000
I understand that it‚Äôs impossible to predict; however, for SigRSV to be at all attractive for more people, I think that the minimum requirement is that at a certain point in time one would have an extremely easy way to know and decide - to sell/redeem or to hold. A more sophisticated tool would also send notices to SigRSV holders that would let them know that a situation which allows them to make a profit occurs. Obviously, among us there are people who can build such tools for their own use (and they may have already done that), but if we see utility in a wider participation, I think we need to assume that while such information is relevant for all potential users of the SigmaUSD site, 99% of them do not have the skills required to build tools.

 I made a spreadsheet to calculate based on entry/exit and assumptions of usage. 

There is also some website tool. I don't remember how it calculates.

Anyway, it could be made easy UI. Those impossible predictions can be removed, if user is willing to make assumptions. That could indeed improve user experience.

@bantg Errr this seems like a risky and terrible idea. If ETH drops a lot, value of collateral would go way down but CDPs would not get liquidated, so the whole system would risk becoming a fractional reserve.

anything that is a slippery slope should not be entertained easily. anything that increases the attack vector for the contract should not be implemented.

lending part of the reserve seems like a red flag, as well as removing the 400% threshold. and relying on third party assets open up to all risks from that asset.

dynamic fee and deviation triggered seem like more safe ideas.


[08/12/2022 3:32 PM] Thomas#0000

> Sigusd bank is basically holding zero sum game, 

Yes. This is true. But how could it not be a zero sum game? 

Only if it generated money out of nothing...  Any protocol in which users put money into a contract and then withdraw money from the contract, and money is neither created nor destroyed within the contract will be a zero-sum game.

And, if you also take the blockchain transaction fees into account, then overall, the "protocol + blockchain" will be a negative-sum game for users of the protocol.

> thus if someone exited before you from usd or rsv with profit, you will exit with loss. So better to fix rsv profit if you have it ASAP

This statement seems incorrect, @kushti .

In the case of SigUSD, as long as the reserve ratio is above 100%, the amount of ERG that you get by exiting (i.e. selling your SigUSD back to the contract) depends only on the price of ERG at the time of your exit, and not on whether others have exited before you.

Even when the reserve ratio is below 100%, the peg loss is designed in a way to discourage "bank runs". Assuming that the price of ERG remains constant, if would actually be better to exit later, because the fees paid by those who exited earlier would accumulate and improve the price of your stablecoins.  If the price of ERG is falling, then it would be more profitable to exit earlier rather than later, but this is because the ERG price is falling and not because of any protocol flaw.

In the case of SigRSV (ReserveCoins), when the reserve ratio is sufficiently higher than the minimum and leaving reserve drainage issues aside, it is on average better to exit (sell SigRSV) later than earlier, because the fees paid by the earlier sellers accumulate in the reserve and thus improve the price of SigRSV.


[08/15/2022 2:44 PM] Bruno#0000
The problem is that the risk of reserve drainage causes an incentive for SigRSV holders to sell SigRSV if they suspect that reserve drainage may happen soon and the prospect of having SigRSV locked when the reserve ratio is below the minimum also causes them to race ("bank run") to sell SigRSV before the reserve ratio goes below the minimum.


[08/15/2022 2:51 PM] Vesi Hiisi#2550
I agree with the zero-sum-game being misleading.

Technically it is true. Just money exchanging hands from one participant to other.

However, the service provided is stability. The sigusd holders pay a fee for that service. Serving that need is a value-add on top of the zero-sum-game.


[08/15/2022 10:36 PM] jspanos#0000

[08/16/2022 11:35 AM] Bruno#0000
@MrStahlfelge, I am interested to know how much fees (both protocol fees and UI fees) are being paid by users of SigmaUSD, both in total and through specific UIs (e.g. sigmausd.io, TokenJay, ...).  Do you happen to know this?


[08/16/2022 11:46 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
you can see this on the chain as it is fully open. if you take a look at the bank history exchanges, you can calc the protocol fee (2% of the amount going in or out the bank).
All transactions with only 3 outboxes are done without a UI because box 1 is bank, box 2 is exchange erg/token, box 3 is transaction fee. Transactions with more outboxes are usually done via a UI.
tokenjay's fee address is the one beginning with 9g8ga and sigmausd.io is the one beginning with 9hFme so you can exactly see which one was used.

 "leaving reserve drainage issues aside" isn't realistic, because the reserve side is offering insurance (risk transfer) to the stablecoin side and "reserve drainage" is the result of insurance claims. Imo it would be interesting to look at the protocol from a ruin theory perspective with Cram√©r-Lundberg type models and monte carlo simulations used in insurance companies.

 Hard to say, since buying/selling on spectrum leads to income for liquidity providers and that also incentivises owning protocol tokens. Also arbitrage bots work between the dex and the protocol, so interacting with one impacts the other one. After all I think you should do what is the best/cheapest option for you, since the protocol shouldn't require that you care about its health.

Thanks, @MrStahlfelge.

But I was wondering if anyone more familiarized with the Explorer API could automate such fee statistics. This is an idea that I suggested here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTgapwydOW0&t=1508s .

> Imo it would be interesting to look at the protocol from a ruin theory perspective with Cram√©r-Lundberg type models and monte carlo simulations used in insurance companies. 

This is a very interesting suggestion. 

The challenge with looking at the problem of crypto-backed stablecoins from the point of view of insurance is that insurance typically requires regular payment of an insurance fee/premium, whereas with stablecoins people don't seem to be willing to pay an ongoing fee for holding stablecoins. On the contrary, they expect to be able to earn unrealistic APRs of 20% or more... This is a challenge that I briefly discussed here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTgapwydOW0&t=887s).

> "leaving reserve drainage issues aside" isn't realistic, because the reserve side is offering insurance (risk transfer) to the stablecoin side and "reserve drainage" is the result of insurance claims. 

Just to clarify: I'm referring to something different when I say "reserve drainage". I'm referring to the problem where users can get more than they should from the reserve due to the fact that the oracle is delayed, as explained here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTgapwydOW0&t=249s). It is realistic to leave this type of "reserve drainage" aside, if we have better oracles.

 Oh, sry, I missunderstood what you meant.

The problem of ongoing fees isn't really a problem. In actuarial mathematics one usually calculates one-time payments. Going from one-time payments to regular payments is just dividing by a quasi geometric series  (sum from starting time to infinity of survival probability times the discount factor). So mathematically it's easy to switch between one-time fees and regular fees and vice versa.

Imo your other point is the real problem. People are expecting yield for taking insurance. That's not how it works. I think the real underlying problem is that we often talk about combinations of protocols like stablecoin + lending or stablecoin + liquidity providing. The first component is costly (stablecoin), whereas the second one generates yield with the coins. I think we should separate these two components as good as possible when discussing stablecoin designs.

@abchris, we are encouraging people to work on djed/sigmausd in the next ErgoHack. Adding sigmausd stats to ergowatch would be a good ergohack project.


[08/25/2022 12:17 PM] Bruno#0000
This is why immutable code with zero-governance is needed...


[08/25/2022 12:45 PM] Bruno#0000
Yes, I'm aware of the concept of present value (of future money), but I have also seen it being wrongly used (e.g. people assuming that the regular fees would continue to be constant forever and hence the series would converge to a finite one-time fee, whereas in reality the regular fees would have to increase and the series would diverge.  I think this mistake might be a key subconscious factor in why most blockchains charge a one-time fee for writing transactions, but not a fee for keeping them stored, and hope they might get away with it in the long term. Ergo is the only blockchain I know that has the storage rent feature that hopefully will properly account for the cost of long-term storage.)

Anyway, back to stablecoins, it may very well be that the series will converge and charging a one-time fee could be mathematically possible. But, even then, there might be psychological issues still. People love to postpone payments and they might not be happy to pay all the future payments at once in the present, even if there is a discount.

But it would be interesting to investigate this more thoroughly.

> People are expecting yield for taking insurance. That's not how it works.

I agree.

I think the reason why people don't see a crypto-backed stablecoin as insurance is that:

1) They think/wish that holding 1 stablecoin is like holding 1 USD bill in their pockets. You don't have to pay anything to hold 1 USD bill in your pocket. So, why should you have to pay anything to hold 1 stablecoin in your wallet?

2) They think/wish that holding 1 stablecoin is like having 1 USD in a bank account. Since banks offer interest rates in savings accounts, why shouldn't stablecoins offer yield as well?

This is a pity.


[08/25/2022 12:57 PM] Bruno#0000
> I think we should separate these two components as good as possible when discussing stablecoin designs.

Yes. In Djed/SigmaUSD, the stablecoin doesn't offer any yield. The reservecoin offers indirect yield in exchange for "stability provision".

I think it could be argued that both stablecoin holders and reservecoin holders are contributing to liquidity provision, but only reservecoin holders are being rewarded (indirectly) for this.

Stablecoin holders are neither paying the insurance premium that they should nor receiving the liquidity provision rewards that they should. Hopefully these two cancel themselves out. But a more fine-grained model that tries to account for these nuances more precisely would be an interesting direction for research.


[08/25/2022 1:02 PM] Gstoiti#0000
That problem of diverging series leads to another interesting question for fee calculation: what's the average lifetime of 1 stablecoin until it gets redeemed and how fast do the probabilities of not beeing redeemed until time t go to zero? Would be interesting to try tracking average stablecoin lifetime, e.g. assuming FIFO, on Ergo, although it is probably not represantative for the future with more usecases.


[08/25/2022 1:08 PM] Bruno#0000
Completely separating stablecoins from liquidity provision can be tricky, because the key to stability is to have unbounded liquidity at the target price level.

At the time when we were designing Djed/SigmaUSD, liquidity pools were still not so common and I think they did not exist on Ergo yet. This is also why, architecturally, the Djed/SigmaUSD contract can be seen as having its own built-in liquidity pool.

Nowadays, exploring designs where the liquidity pool is a separate component makes sense. @kushti and I discussed this recently and I know that DexyUSD is going in this direction.

Should be fine, oracle's were struggling to keep up with the blocks when they were 20s but should just be a bit slower atm. Tokenjay also works better

 Do you have an old phone for the cold wallet funtionality? Probably safer than desktop.

Does TokenJay work with the cold wallet functionality?

Probably waited too long. It is crucial to be fast with the swap transaction because other actors and oracle can spend the boxes the transaction was built with

Yes. To be honest I was surprised that so many people get the AgeUSD swap going with the cold wallet! 
If you consolidate boxes beforehand it will probably have less qr codes

Check explorer to find the proxy contract (your funds should be sitting there), then send 0.01Erg to it. Once funded, the refund function will work to return stuck funds.


[09/18/2022 7:06 AM] wewmonic demonic#3271
how many confirmations does the sigRSV redeem smart contract need? it moved from 16 to 27 so maybe it's just slow


[09/18/2022 7:06 AM] wewmonic demonic#3271

(re @Thomas : *Up it goes fast. Sometimes 2 ticks. Down....????*) 
 
 Afaik the rate for oracle ticks is based on blocks, so since these days the blocks are coming in slowly, same goes for oracle updates.. Its an aspect of the merge effect.

[09/18/2022 4:59 PM] question86#0000
Yeah, over the last 2 days the chain got slow because difficulty went up to cope with all the new hashpower. Because the difficulty adjustment has a delay, it went up even when hash spike was over and now hash was droppen while difficulty stays the same (until tomorrow i think). So the update frequency dropped with the block time.


[09/18/2022 4:59 PM] question86#0000
Difficulty on 13/09 - 14/09 was magnitudes lower.


[09/18/2022 5:00 PM] question86#0000
It will balance out over the next week or two.


[09/18/2022 5:00 PM] question86#0000
The chain has to adjust to the different environment, that will take a while. It was anticipated.

It got unusable to say the best  üòâ Yes great for arbitrageit would be but like 6 hours delay wtf? Sry but needs adjustment


[09/18/2022 5:11 PM] question86#0000
Yep, its a nice example. In my link, you can see we had a 40 secs blocktime during the 15/09 -> 16/09 timeframe you marked. On the second example (today) you can see our blocktime is about 190 seconds - the oracle tick takes like 8 blocks to revaluate the data. So in the first example, updates happend every 320 seconds while now we are at somewhere around 1500 seconds.


[09/18/2022 5:12 PM] question86#0000
(re @Thomas : *It got unusable to say the best  üòâ Yes great for arbitrageit would be but like 6 hours delay wtf? Sry but needs adjustment*) 
 
 Its unusable for trading indeed at the moment... The difficulty will adjust to come back to 120 secs per block in average again.


[09/18/2022 5:16 PM] question86#0000
And it sums up. Every tick needs currently roundabout 350% of the current speed to adjust. Since the oracle has a maximum % it can change the value (to smoothen the flow and prevent frontrunning the market for whales), you can do the math what happens now... very cemented price data. Maybe it will help to kick the "quick gains and leave" newcomers out because they have a horrible first impression.

(re @Thomas : *It got unusable to say the best  üòâ Yes great for arbitrageit would be but like 6 hours delay wtf? Sry but needs adjustment*) 
 
 Can't adjust without new contract and also bringing in new attack vectors. The Ethereum merge affecting all of ergo is a bit of the scope of sigUSD contact

Update activated: TokenJay will chain waiting AgeUSD transactions from now on so that more users have a chance to swap with the few blocks we have right now.
Please note that the feature depends on the transactions to be propagated through the network, so it can still happen that swaps outbid each other instead of getting chained under certain circumstances.
I hope the new behaviour will be for the better, let's test it in the wild. Feedback appreciated.

[09/28/2022 9:50 AM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
One way to stop sigmabank drain attacks due to oracle lag would be a delay in price setting.

Examples:
1) check price when tx is minted. Check price 1h later, if they are within 2% range, then execute, otherwise revert.

2) calculate average across mint time and 24h after that, and execute with that price. 

These are very bad in terms of usability, and they remove a huge advantage of immediate 100% sigusd redeem liquidity.

However, oracles will never be real time. Tradfi is not real time either, and at the extreme its about physical location to have a millisecond edge to frontrun others.

So some price delay mechanism might be considered to level the playing field.

I wonder if there's a way to build it a volatility component. So if price of erg is stable for past 7 days, minting/redeeming is fast, but if erg price has changed by XX% or more then put in the 1 hour check


[09/28/2022 1:58 PM] scotman8888#0000
With erg we go through long times of relative stability and then short periods of volatility and that seems to be when the opportunists strike


[09/28/2022 2:11 PM] Bruno#0000
Coincidentally, @DDev and I were discussing today a variation of Djed that he is implementing in Solidity and that will make the fee depend on various factors. He already made it depend on the reserve ratio and the discussion today was about making it depend on the volatility as well. In times of high volatility, the fee will be higher, in times of low volatility, it will be lower.

Completely halting trading for 1h as you suggested, would be a circuit breaker (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/circuitbreaker.asp).


[09/28/2022 2:24 PM] Bruno#0000
Regarding levelling the playing field, note that even with a real-time oracle, the playing field wouldn't be completely levelled, because the contract is "playing" with a public and deterministic strategy, whereas anyone interacting with the contract is playing with a strategy that is secret and unknown to the contract.  (cc: @kushti, remember we discussed this?)

The two examples that you gave are specific ways of obfuscating the contract's strategy.

 Yes, because your profit is "path dependent", i.e., it doesn't only depend on the data like the price and reserve ratio now and at the time of cashing out, but also on the history of interactions between those two points of time.

[10/16/2022 11:29 AM] Gstoiti#0000
Forwarded from Gstoiti: One short example what path dependent means: Suppose the Erg price at the start is 2$. You mint reserve coins, but there are no stablecoins in circulation. The erg price increases to 3$. You didn't gain anything, because stablecoin holders didn't lose anything, since there weren't any of them. Then someone buys a lot stablecoins and then the erg price dips to 2.5$ for a few days. The stablecoin holder redeems his coins and gets more erg back (because the price decreased since the time he bought them and this effect is higher than the fees he pays/paid). This means your reserve coins are now worth less erg than at the time you bought them (because the reserves decreased), although the erg price increased from 2$ to 2.5$.

In another scenario your reserve coins could be worth more if the price increased from 2$ to 2.5$.

Hence, the information of the erg price at a given point in time doesn't suffice to calculate what your reserve coins are worth. One needs to know the complete history of the contract between the time you bought them and the time you want to redeem them.

 Forwarded from Gstoiti: No, because for example the scenario above could happen again and again (from 2$ to 2.5, then from 5$ to 15$...).

But if the dips happen only for a short period of time (so that the oracle smoothing guarantees that shorters can't make much profit) or are very small (so that the fees don't allow shorters to make profits) and the erg price increases in general, then you will gain (or don't lose) ergs. How much depends on how much stable coins are in circulation and how much fees are paid after you entered the contract and so on. As I said, the payoff is path dependent. The erg price alone doesn't suffice to answer how much you will gain/lose.


[10/16/2022 11:33 AM] Gstoiti#0000

 I've tried explaining SigRSV several times on Reddit. The links to other posts at the bottom of this post can help with understanding it. But, ultimately, you won't really understand it until you use it, and you'll most likely lose money at first. In my opinion, now is not a good time to buy SigRSV, even though it is at an all-time high. Maybe think about it when it hits 2000. https://www.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/comments/s0bnu1/comment/hs3bfsw/

Can you run SigmaUSD on the testnet? Just thinking it would be nice to be able to play a lot so as to really get a feel.


[10/16/2022 3:58 PM] glasgowm#0000
Think of it like poker but instead of the winner taking the full pot, they get a % based on how good their hand is proportional to the size of their bet. The dynamic is that simple, even if you get a Royal Flush is the next round the amount you end up winning is reduced because there‚Äôs less in the pot to claim. 

‚ÄòYour hand‚Äô is the difference between the price you minted and the price you redeemed, which makes giving any repeatable conditions to ensure profits pretty hard. 

Minting RSV a bit below below 400% RR and redeeming as soon as it goes above is the best way as SigUSD can‚Äôt redeem during this period. (Providing you get enough of an increase to cover the mint fee of ~4%)

Is this true?  In Djed, the stablecoins can always be redeemed. Are there additional restrictions for redeeming stablecoins in SigmaUSD of which I am not aware?

In Djed, only the *minting* of stablecoins is restricted when the reserve ratio is below the minimum, but not their *redemption/burning*.

> Suppose the Erg price at the start is 2$. You mint reserve coins, but there are no stablecoins in circulation. The erg price increases to 3$. You didn't gain anything, because stablecoin holders didn't lose anything, since there weren't any of them. Then someone buys a lot stablecoins and then the erg price dips to 2.5$ for a few days. **The stablecoin holder redeems his coins** and gets more erg back (because the price decreased since the time he bought them and this effect is higher than the fees he pays/paid). This means your reserve coins are now worth less erg than at the time you bought them (because the reserves decreased), although the erg price increased from 2$ to 2.5$.

This effect (i.e. the reduction in value of the reserve coins) occurs even if the stablecoin holder does *not* redeems his coins. Just by having them, a portion of the reserves is allocated as liabilities to pay back the stablecoin holder should he decide to redeem the stablecoins. This already reduces the equity and hence the value of the reservecoins.   (The redemption of stablecoins by the stablecoin holder does make this effect irreversible, though.)

Although this path dependency effect is real, the discussion above may give the impression that profit/loss through reservecoins (SigRSV) is unpredictable and completely dependent on the actions of others or even that stablecoin holders might be stealing reserves from reservecoin holders.  The following statements complement what was said by others above and may help (or not?) to clarify what is going on:


[10/16/2022 11:04 PM] Bruno#0000
1) The value of a reservecoin is always the equity divided by the number of reservecoins in circulation.  

2) The equity is the reserve surplus: the reserve minus what is needed to pay back all stablecoins in circulation.

3) Nevertheless, the equity *grows* (because of the minting/burning fees) when stablecoins are minted or burned.  (In other words, even though the equity depends on the number of stablecoins in circulation, one cannot cause a reduction in the equity just by minting or burning stablecoins.)

4) When the number of stablecoins remains constant, there is a very clear relationship between the price of ERG and the price of reservecoins. This relationship is clearly determined by the reserve ratio.

5) What minting and burning of stablecoins causes (outside the control of reservecoin holders) is a change in the reserve ratio. So, it changes the relationship between the future price of ERG and the future price of reservecoins. This indirect dependency is where the path dependency effect comes from.

6) The idea of having a "minimum reserve ratio" and a "maximum reserve ratio" is precisely to limit by how much users can affect, through actions such as minting/burning of stablecoins and reservecoins, the reserve ratio for current stablecoin and reservecoin holders.  (In the paper, the case of reservecoin holders being diluted by users buying more reservecoins is discussed. The path dependency example discussed above is similar: reservecoin holders get "anti-diluted" by the purchase of stablecoins.)


[10/16/2022 11:04 PM] Bruno#0000
7) One obvious way to completely prevent the reserve ratio from being affected is to allow only simultaneous minting or burning of both coins at a proportion that keeps the reserve ratio unchanged. But this would degrade the usability of the contract for most users.  (But maybe it would be a variation worth trying?)

8) The Extended Djed protocol also suggests having an "optimal reserve ratio" and dynamic fees that grow as we move away from the optimal. At first, I thought that this could be a problem for usability, because users would prefer to have a range of reserve ratios (between the minimum and the maximum) in which the fee is fixed, as in Minimum Djed. However, the behaviour that we see in SigmaUSD suggests that the minimum reserve ratio is behaving a bit like the "optimal", but with an effectively infinite fee below it (i.e. the prohibition of minting stablecoins and burning reservecoins) and a fixed fee above it. Rather than have this chaotic behavior around "minimal reserve ratio", it might be better to have something similar to the "optimal reserve ratio" of Extended Djed then.

Is there anyone in the Ergo community who would be interested in researching and developing further the ideas discussed in points 7 and 8 above?

(re @octopus_shepherd : *It's better (cheaper) to buy SigRSV from sigmausd.io than swapping on spectrum? I always do it from spectrum.*) 
 
 buying from spectrum is trading circulating supply and the price is determined by the price action of that liquidity pool. sigmausd/tokenjay is minting new tokens into existence.

sometimes you can get cheaper price on the dex based on price action.

Quick question, with Rosen bridge, will that open up SigUSD liquidity to Cardano?


[01/03/2023 10:20 AM] Gstoiti#0000
(re @thestophe : *Quick question, with Rosen bridge, will that open up SigUSD liquidity to Cardano?*) 
 
 Yes, but since Cardano already has a stablecoin (iUSD) and Djed by Coti will basically provide the same algorithm as SigUSD, I don't think many will use it on Cardano.


[01/03/2023 11:57 AM] thestophe#0000

Same as SigmaUSD afaik, KYC via Coti front-end but you can interact with the SC directly without KYC. 

Not sure what their oracle setup/interval is or how it‚Äôs smoothed. Can‚Äôt find many details here.


[01/03/2023 12:10 PM] glasgowm#0000
SigUSD has a couple years advantage and is shown to be robust, so has that advantage over Djed while being bootstrapped & SigUSD can be mixed easily so I imagine a few people will still opt to hold SigUSD over competitors.


[01/03/2023 12:54 PM] Gstoiti#0000
But one has to bear the additional bridging risk if one wants to hold it on Cardano

 But then they probably would have to argue why none of the changes proposed in the djed paper made it into their version of the protocol.

"The protocol has been live on Ergo for more than a year. Researchers learned a lot, but we ignore their proposals, because implementing them is too complicated for us."

I agree with the general sentiment towards this particular deployment of Djed, and I wish I could tell you facts that would validate and reinforce this sentiment.


[01/31/2023 2:35 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Sorry for the semantics, but I believe Djed is the particular deployment of the AgeUSD protocol.


[01/31/2023 2:44 PM] Gstoiti#0000
(re  : *<cafebedouin> Sorry for the semantics, but I believe Djed is the particular deployment of the AgeUSD protocol.*) 
 
 Yes, but also no. The second paper calls the protocol/mechanism Djed. So Djed by Coti is a deployment of the minimal Djed protocol, which is basically the AgeUSD protocol.


[01/31/2023 3:09 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Not keeping up on Djed, but renaming the protocol to your implementation seems kind of brain-damaged. But, sounds par for the course.


[01/31/2023 6:19 PM] Gstoiti#0000
(re  : *<cafebedouin> Not keeping up on Djed, but renaming the protocol to your implementation seems kind of brain-damaged. But, sounds par for the course.*) 
 
 Imo it's the other way around. People from IOG wrote the second paper with modifications of AgeUSD and called it Djed. Then IOG made a deal with Coti to implement it and they called the implementation also Djed. So they named the implementation after the protocol.

But I dislike it as well. On the other hand, we had to deal with many confused people here asking about the difference between AgeUSD and SigmaUSD. 

I guess there are people like us who care about such stuff and people who want to keep it simple. We are probably the minority üòÖ

[01/31/2023 11:30 PM] Zahnentferner#0000
OK. Here is a brief history of Djed and SigmaUSD research, development and naming:

* Research and development started in Q2/Q3 2020 as a collaboration between people who were, at that time, affiliated with IOHK, Emurgo and Ergo. We were all using the same Slack channel in Emurgo's slack channel. It was a very nice environment, with a lot of feedback between research and implementation.

* The goal was to develop implementations for Cardano and Ergo.

* Because these would be "twin" implementations, the people who were then at Emurgo proposed the names AgeUSD and BelUSD for the *implementations* on Ergo and Cardano, respectively, after the Egyptian mythological twins Agenor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenor) and Belus (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belus_(Egyptian)).

* In the Ergo Summit of 2021, when the stablecoin implementation for Ergo was announced, it was still referred to as AgeUSD. But, a few weeks later, when it was launched in Q1 2021, the Ergo community decided to rename that implementation to SigmaUSD, given the significance of "Sigma" for the Ergo ecosystem.

* AgeUSD/SigmaUSD is an implementation of the "minimal" protocol described in the white paper, which was released only in July 2021.

* When AgeUSD/SigmaUSD was released in Q1 2021, most of the "issues" of the minimal protocol, which were described in the white paper, were already theoretically foreseen, and the ideas of the "extended" protocol had already been discussed in that shared Slack channel. But, for various reasons (which I can explain in another message), AgeUSD ended up being an implementation of the minimal protocol and not the extended one. And, with hindsight, I think this was a good choice.

* Working out the details of the extended protocol and formally verifying the minimal protocol took time. Consequently, the paper was released only in July 2021. Until that time, there was no name for the protocol itself. I <clipped message>

Agenor
Agenor (; Ancient Greek: ·ºàŒ≥ŒÆŒΩœâœÅ or ŒëŒ≥ŒÆŒΩŒøœÅŒ±œÇ Agƒìnor; English translation: "heroic, manly") was in Greek mythology and history a Phoenician king of Tyre or Sidon.

* "Djed", as you may know, is a symbol of stability in Egyptian mythology (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djed). So, in a way, it continues the "Egyptian" tradition of the original names "AgeUSD" and "BelUSD" that had been proposed for the twin implementations.


[01/31/2023 11:47 PM] Zahnentferner#0000
* Currently, there are 3 publicly known implementations of Djed:  SigmaUSD on Ergo; the implementation in Plutus, done by IOHK's Jean-Frederique and deployed/operated by COTI; and a Solidity implementation started by the very people who were at Emurgo when the stablecoin collaboration started and who intended to develop BelUSD.

* There is a testnet deployment of this Solidity implementation on Milkomeda. You can try it here (https://milkomeda-c1-testnet.djed.one/).

Tokenjay fees are low the 2% fees are actually baked into the sigUSD smart contract. They were introduced to reduce manipulation and attack vectors!


[02/06/2023 11:30 PM] $alex.ada#1660
But how can you possibly arbitrage with 2% fee? there is no way the price difference between spectrum and the SC will be more than 2%.. why would I ever use the SC rather than just selling on secondary?


[02/06/2023 11:37 PM] $alex.ada#1660
I guess I am to dumb to figure out arbitrage. I messed around with different options and I can‚Äôt see a way to make a profit


[02/06/2023 11:50 PM] $alex.ada#1660
If the SC has a fee, shouldn‚Äôt it only be on one side of the transactions? Like either on sales or purchases? cause it‚Äôs really costing me like 4%.. if I buy SigUSD today it costs me 2% then if I turn around and sell it back in 1 month cause the Œ£ price dropped, I have to pay another 2%. I am trying to work this out in my head and I just can‚Äôt see a way that the protocol is gonna function like it should with the fees


[02/07/2023 12:16 AM] cafebedouin#9837
SigmaUSD is not designed for arbitrage. You're probably thinking of Dexy, which is.

You can do it with, SigUSD/SigRSV. At $1.7 a $0.09 change can get you in profit. You could even buy both sides and wait for swings. But, there are better ways to make money.


[02/07/2023 12:19 AM] cafebedouin#9837
One thing I do, when I am in SigUSD, is wait for Spectrum to swing so the price is higher than the amount if SigUSD. It is often possible to get out at no penalty, if you are willing to wait a day or two and are dealing with relatively small amounts.

 If you have ideas, then please share.

Lowering fees risks increasing reserve drain, so such suggestions should be accompanied by new ways to tackle that problem.

For example time-locked minting metioned here:

(re  : *<$alex.ada> But how can you possibly arbitrage with 2% fee? there is no way the price difference between spectrum and the SC will be more than 2%.. why would I ever use the SC rather than just selling on secondary?*) 
 
 There's two arbritage bots currently running that trade between sigUSD bank and spectrum liquidity pools, they do a huge amount of profitable trades everyday. You have to take into account a lagging oracle on the sigUSD bank and also a sigUSD liquidity pool with pretty low liquidity relative to large pools so the price swings can be pretty dramatic for large enough trades. But if you are trying to manually arbritage you are probably out of luck, if there's a profitable trade the bots will outbid your miner fee automatically and win the tx. These arbritage bots are useful in my opinion, it keeps the sigUSD pool pegged to the outside world when possible while the contract is not locked below 400%.


[02/07/2023 7:54 AM] cafebedouin#9837
It's counterintuitive, but it actually helps the liquidity providers too. Here's a paper with the idea: https://research.paradigm.xyz/uniswaps-alchemy

 Follow your latest transaction in your wallet. It's the long one the funds are sent to. But if it's buying then it might've just not left your wallet in the first place.

thanks for the docs link


[03/15/2023 1:16 PM] cafebedouin#9837
It would be a different design, and the answer would depend on the protocol design. Presumably, it would be something like different classes of stock which come with different risk/reward profiles.


[03/15/2023 1:17 PM] Bullskey#6363
I want to learn more about that, is there any discussions or papers on the topic ? Or maybe someone knows enough to explain all the new modifications that would need to happen to enable that change


[03/15/2023 1:29 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Imo wouldn't change a lot, just the risk profile of the reserves and additional oracles needed. One would also need reserve deposit and withdrawal rules (e.g. one can only deposit/withdraw assets in a fixed ratio)

(re  : *<Bullskey> I want to learn more about that, is there any discussions or papers on the topic ? Or maybe someone knows enough to explain all the new modifications that would need to happen to enable that change*) 
 
 There is a long standing debate on Ethereum side about using multiple vs. Single asset as stablecoin collateral.

DAI went for multiple, LUSD has only ETH as collateral.

Criticism for single asset is that the stablecoin mcap is limited by the collateral. I dont quite get it, since usage pumps the collateral price.

Multiple enables higher capital efficiency, especially if other stablecoins are used as collatetal. That is short term thinking, and its failures were on display last weekend, when DAI depegged.

Multiple collateral exposes to multiple external risks, adds conplexity, requires more oracles, and governance to manage. Not resilient.


[03/15/2023 1:32 PM] Gstoiti#0000
If the assets are correlated, one would usually get risk reducing diversification effects. That's imo the biggest benefit, but it comes with the downside of more difficult contracts and need for  additional oracles (increasing exploit/hack risk).


[03/15/2023 1:32 PM] Bullskey#6363
well lets assume someone would create a new stablecoin that uses both Ergo and ADA as collateral


[03/15/2023 1:33 PM] Bullskey#6363
right, so audits will be vital


[03/15/2023 1:33 PM] cafebedouin#9837
You aren't getting answers because your question is akin to: I want to learn more about stablecoin design and how financial products work. At base, a stablecoin, and financial instruments in general, is about shifting risk/rewards. If I buy an annuity contract guaranteeing 7% every year, the counterparty, or the insurance company, is betting on the fact that, over time, the stock market has tended to return 15%. But, the insurance company takes on the risk to earn the spread, and I buy the contract to get a predictable return. Stablecoin use a similar idea. You could design one that works just like an annuity, with a smart contract working like the insurance company, which is kind of how SigmaUSD, when you strip out a lot of detail.


[03/15/2023 1:33 PM] Bullskey#6363

[03/15/2023 1:35 PM] Bullskey#6363

then how would you go on about securing a project knowing that there is extra risk to the code


[03/15/2023 1:38 PM] Bullskey#6363
so having 2 collateral tokens like ERG and ADA, would mean you are long both tokens ?

Regarding multiple assets in the reserve, in addition to what has already been said above about advantages and disadvantages, I would also point to Gresham's law (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law) as a disadvantage. If you have two reserve assets and one of them is perceived as "good" (or "better") and the other is perceived as "bad" (or "worse"), there would be a tendency to withdraw the "better" asset from the reserve and leave only the "worse" asset there. Preventing this tendency and protecting against the vulnerabilities that it brings would require a more complex algorithm.

This is the disadvantage that led us to choose a single reserve asset for Djed/SigmaUSD, despite the diversification advantages of multiple reserve assets.

[03/15/2023 6:48 PM] Bruno#0000
I think an interesting approach to handle multiple reserve assets would be to:

* have multiple deployments of Djed/SigmaUSD, each with a single reserve asset.

* have a new metastablecoin X that is backed by a basket of the other Djed/SigmaUSD stablecoins.

* the weights/ratio of each stablecoin in the basket could be determined by their relative individual TVL. Withdrawals and deposits from the basket could follow a multi-asset liquidity pool approach where the fee increases the more the transaction causes the ratios to deviate from the optimal.

This would guarantee that each Djed/SigmaUSD deployment is simple and free from Gresham's law issues. The new metastablecoin would have the benefit of diversification of reserves, and the multi-asset liquidity pool approach would provide some protection against the issues arising from Gresham's law.

by the way, now that I think about it. If I put ERG in the treasury and mint SigmaRSV, and ERG goes up in value but SigmaRSV does not move. Wouldnt that technically mean that the treasury just gained money ?

*_Ceteris paribus_*, this is not possible. When ERG goes up, SigRSV goes up even more (how much more depends on the reserve ratio).  When ERG goes down, SigRSV goes down even more. (The "ceteris paribus" is important. If conditions change and, for instance, other transactions occur, what I have just said may not hold.)


[03/15/2023 7:22 PM] Bullskey#6363
what are the forces that make SigRSV move ?


[03/15/2023 7:23 PM] Bullskey#6363
I though that SigRSV would go up if volume on the mint/burn goes up instead of price of ERG


[03/15/2023 7:23 PM] Bruno#0000
Maybe start by reading stuff about supply and demand, and how the affect prices... Read about the quantity theory of money as well, and about the various functions of money.

This is also true.

do you have any specific books, videos or links to suggest I start reading from ?


[03/15/2023 7:26 PM] Bruno#0000
Under ideal conditions, two things:

* The leverage effect that I mentioned.
* The revenue from trading fees that you mentioned.

Under non-ideal conditions (e.g. excessive oracle delays), reserve drainage may occur and negatively affect SigRSV price.


[03/15/2023 7:26 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I think of it as a function of Erg Price increase, difference between current Erg Price and average mint price of SigUSD and fees. That goes to the reserve.


[03/15/2023 7:28 PM] Bullskey#6363
I am not sure how the leverage effect works. I understand that if someone mints SigUSD for ERG and ERG goes up, suddently that person gets less ERG if they withdraw, now the question is, how is that ERG given to the SigRSV holders ? I dont understand how is it that this value is transfered to them instead of staying in the reserve? Is it hard codded ?


[03/15/2023 7:28 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Also, total amount if SigUSD matters too.


[03/15/2023 7:29 PM] Bruno#0000
Nothing that I remember now.

Ah, I think investopedia is a good initial resource to learn definitions of various concepts.

(I need to go offline now...)

It's fairly straight forward. Try plugging in the numbers into a spreadsheet from SigmaUSD.io. Then, change the variables: price, amount in reserve assuming an amount of SigUSD has been minted at some average price, etc.

[03/15/2023 7:34 PM] Bruno#0000
Ah, I also think that, with most economics concepts, it is helpful to make "small-world thought experiments" to understand them. Imagine that there are only a few actors in the world, exchanging only a few goods between themselves and using money for these exchanges. Then start thinking what happens if the demand and supply of goods and money increases or decreases... And this will build your intuition...

Forwarded from ErgoBridgeBot: <Zimulakra> It's good to see some of my thoughts tracking with Bruno's.
I'm a huge fan of one reserve asset per deployment and the basket of stables backing the meta-stablecoin.

I'd be very curious to hear Bruno's thoughts on an Erg backed stablecoin pegged to the 200 week moving average of the price of Erg. I feel like people would love to have a place to save longterm that is safe from volatility and Fiat debasement.


[03/16/2023 1:03 AM] Bruno#0000
> I'd be very curious to hear Bruno's thoughts on an Erg backed stablecoin pegged to the 200 week moving average of the price of Erg

Yes, I have thought about pegging to moving averages before. I think it would be an interesting idea. But it is not as straightforward as it may seem at first. The challenge is the following:

* When the target price is a moving average, it becomes possible to predict the future target price. For example, if the current ERG price is much higher than the 200-week moving average, then we know that, in the near future, the 200-week moving average will be rising, to catch up with the ERG price.

I am afraid that this price foresight may be somewhat analogous to an oracle delay, and we know that oracle delays are bad. So, price foresight could be bad too.

So, if we would like to have a moving average as a target price, I feel we also would have to have some mechanisms to neutralize the price foresight, such as time locks on the minting and burning operations, for instance.

But I haven't had time to really think deeply about whether this price foresight would really be a problem, as I suspect.

> Fiat debasement

Do you mean the fact that fiat currencies are steadily losing their value due to inflation?

Note that pegging to a moving average of the  base coin is not the only way to handle this problem. It would also be possible to peg to, for instance, USD from 2022 or to a inflation index.


[03/16/2023 1:28 AM] Bullskey#6363
Haven protocol is a project that created a privacy stablecoin, I wont go into details about the mechanism but they used a moving average for the price and thats exactly the problem they had, they had to create a higher fee and people have to wait a lock period before receiving redeemed tokens and whatnot. Not competitive with the current system of SigUSD imo


[03/16/2023 1:29 AM] Bullskey#6363
ok but here the question comes, whats the point of having a basket of stables backing if we have 1 that works ? At this point it just seems like too many stables that wont be used


[03/16/2023 1:32 AM] Bullskey#6363
wouldnt it be better to just have 1 stablecoin regardless of the theory of Gresham, because what if the 2 backing assets are not necessarily one better than the other, rather they both offer different things and are valued for different reason hence people that are looking to use a utility offered by one rather than the other, they will withdraw in that asset


[03/16/2023 1:34 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Spreads risk, presumably the basket would be different currencies, damy as DXY.


[03/16/2023 1:35 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Damy=same


[03/16/2023 1:36 AM] Bullskey#6363
How would it be possible to peg to USD from 2022 ? Wouldnt that simply be a token that wins value as inflation goes higher ? Because if you think about it, its technically just a stablecoin that takes its value depending on what the USD of today does, because thats the value of the 2022 USD is calculated. Otherwise we would have to create a currency that is a constant and that is impossible


[03/16/2023 1:36 AM] Bullskey#6363
DXY ??


[03/16/2023 1:36 AM] Bullskey#6363
ohhh you mean the dollar index ?


[03/16/2023 1:36 AM] Bullskey#6363
but that measures the value of USD against all other currencies rather than a basket of all currencies


[03/16/2023 1:40 AM] cafebedouin#9837
DXY is a weighted mean against a basket if currencies. Close in concept to a meta stable, I think.


[03/16/2023 1:40 AM] Bullskey#6363
not really, the DXY is the USD vs all other currencies


[03/16/2023 1:40 AM] Bullskey#6363
if DXY go up it means the US dollar is gaining in value vs other fiat currencies and vice versa


[03/16/2023 1:41 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Right. Same idea could be applied to Dexy Gold, for example.


[03/16/2023 1:42 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Or, you could make a commodity stable with multiple.


[03/16/2023 1:42 AM] cafebedouin#9837

[03/16/2023 1:42 AM] Bullskey#6363
is it just a gold pegged crypto?


[03/16/2023 1:42 AM] cafebedouin#9837
First version of Dexy will be pegged to gold.


[03/16/2023 1:43 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Same concept works for other commodities you can get Oracle pricing for.

staying on the topic of the stable


[03/16/2023 1:46 AM] Bullskey#6363
I get the idea of having multiple stables but isnt that not capital efficient ? I mean liquidity is a huge issue in crypto


[03/16/2023 1:47 AM] Bullskey#6363
I think it would be better to have 1 bigger stable that has multiple collateral, because then there is only 1 reserve coin


[03/16/2023 1:49 AM] cafebedouin#9837

 The idea is pretty straight forward, I want to create a system similar to the one SigmaUSD is using, except the reserve token would have its own chain that would be a privacy chain (maybe a fork of monero) and the backing token would be BTC or XMR or both. 
I am sure the cross-chain would be no issue by looking at how THORChain does its cross-chain. Using a similar system, it shouldnt be an issue, they also are open-source and are adding XMR soon to their protocol
If I have to pick between BTC and XMR I would personally use XMR. But with the idea of Bruno of having multiple stables systems and then 1 metastablecoin seems attractive
the metastablecoin can also be the interoperable one with all other chains while the first ones are only available via the main chain

 - what is the stablecoin for? 
> Defi, tvl, max profits, growth etc.
> or real usage with maximum stability and resilience?

- I dont know thorchain, but cross chain usually always comes with security concerns. There is a reason we are in Ergo. For example, thorchain (pos?) Validators could be enforced to sanction a privacy coin.

- bridging nonnative assets adds bridge risk.

- multiple collateral adds multiple oracle risk.

- the privacy idea is good. There was an idea a while back to combine mixer and sigmausd. Mixer needs liquidity. Sigmarsv could use the extra fees from mixer. 

As you see, I am critical of the security assumptions, but if you want fast growth, then stability and resilience is not the winning strategy.


[03/16/2023 11:26 AM] Bullskey#6363
The goal of the stablecoin is to create a privacy stablecoin that is decentralized, hard pegged, and scalable


[03/16/2023 11:26 AM] Bullskey#6363
THORChain has been pretty safe for a while, no hacks and their tvl has only grown bigger

 This was true for ronin and wormhole and every other big hack out there.

I would research the chain security very carefully before committing to build on it. Also look at alternatives to compare.

In my view POS is fundamentally flawed, and therefore not resilient.

 He means yields in eth for example have to compete against staking rewards, so they might be inflated

[03/16/2023 2:36 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Organic rewards for lending are going to be lower than inflated ones, so people would rather just stake risk free.

(re  : *<Bullskey> I know it might seem obvious to you, but just to make sure I get it, why is that a problem?*) 
 
 It encourages risk by creating a hurdle that is hard to overcome organically. Let's call it hidden leverage.


[03/16/2023 2:36 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
So now people inflate the rewards and it makes the whole process unstable


[03/16/2023 2:36 PM] Armeanio#0000
Enough hidden leverage and you build systemic risk. A good example is tokens with high apy that debase their value.


[03/16/2023 2:51 PM] Armeanio#0000
Simply put there has to be an incentive to hold token B vs token A. 

Why take on additional risk when you can armchair protocol rewards. 

Some are moving towards LSD where you get a fancy new type of rehypothecation. However that could also build a new type of systemic risk in the event instability and mass liquidation. All we can say there is lets see.

 Imo the situation is way more nuanced. Viewing staking rewards as 100% profits is simplified and ignores dilution completely. Net return for staking is pretty low for most PoS protocols compared to an alternative token without emissions. And it's self regulating in some sense: if more people stake, returns decrease.

 Of course it's nuanced by A and B.

In a zero rate market different assumptions exist, especially when the payout is A to A.

Hopefully over time defi as a whole minimizes friction, leverage and risk. Easier to do with simpler assumptions.


[03/16/2023 3:48 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Agree, but imo it's not obvious which is the "simpler" setting, PoW with slightly negative returns for holding or PoS with slightly positive returns for staking. And there is also the question whether staking really should be considered as the "risk-free" rate of return.

Additional options, e.g. staking, could simplify things as well.

The best person to ask about the oracle used by COTI's Djed is Jean-Frederic Etienne. He is not participating in any discord server, as far as I know. But I could relay questions to him.


[03/16/2023 5:44 PM] Bruno#0000
Also, keep in mind that the Djed Alliance's discord server is a place to discuss any version, implementation and deployment of Djed, including SigmaUSD, COTI's Djed, the upcoming Djed on Milkomeda, and others...

> In my view POS is fundamentally flawed, and therefore not resilient.

+1. To see this, just consider the simple extreme corner case of a PoS chain with a single indivisible coin and the owner of this single coin transferring it someone else. Then ask yourself who has the authority to write this transaction to the blockchain and ask yourself if you would trust this chain if you were receiving the coin.

I don't think we should just resign ourselves to using PoW forever...  Something better than both PoS and PoW needs to be created.

how does the team know, how much the fee should be to fix this issue of front running ? The team simply rose the fee to 2%. What formula was used ?

also, are there any plans to upgrade the UI of the sigmaUSD site ?


[03/16/2023 9:24 PM] Bullskey#0000
I just read up on Greshams law and it basically explains that if 2 currencies are legal tender, for example Gold and Silver; people will use gold for savings and silver to spend everywhere because gold is better, hence gold will not circulate a lot and silver will be used for most transactions. On the other hand if silver loses too much value, people wont accept silver anymore and start accepting only gold because they dont believe in silver anymore. I am not sure how that law would apply with BTC and XMR, Both have hard cap, Greshams law apply to currencies that are and can be debased.

[03/16/2023 10:01 PM] Bullskey#6363
I also wanted to ask, what is the incentive to mint and redeem SigmaRSV instead of buying it on the market ? Is it cheaper since the fee is only 1% for minting SigmaUSD ?


[03/16/2023 10:09 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
The cheapest way to get it is through tokenjay. There is often a price impact using the dex, but if you want to get sigusd/rsv when the protocol is locked that is your only option


[03/16/2023 10:14 PM] Bullskey#6363
then why would anyone redeem/mint sigmaRSV instead of buying/selling it


[03/16/2023 10:17 PM] Bullskey#6363
also, what if for some reason people just start buying SigmaRSV, wouldnt that break the system ? Because 1$ worth of SigmaRSV can only be redeemed for 1$ worth of Ergo, if SigmaRSV price skyrockets for whatever reason, wouldn't that mean that There is more dollar value to SigmaRSV then there is Ergo in dollar value in the reserve, in other words, you cant redeem most of SigmaRSV tokens even if there is no SigmaUSD issued


[03/16/2023 10:36 PM] glasgowm#0000
(re  : *<Bullskey> then why would anyone redeem/mint sigmaRSV instead of buying/selling it*) 
 
 Tokenjay interacts directly with the smart contract & does mint it. DEX is usually a worse deal.

 Not that simple, if there‚Äôs nobody but you in the bank for instance, doesn‚Äôt matter if it does a 10x there‚Äôs no extra value to extract other than your ERG.

 Right, so would that not affect the treasury in any way ?


[03/16/2023 10:40 PM] glasgowm#0000
It would improve the health of the treasury as the fee goes back in, but you can‚Äôt mint RSV past 800% RR.


[03/16/2023 10:40 PM] glasgowm#0000
Minting at 300% is better than 800%, if that‚Äôs what you mean - as your position is less diluted.

reserve


[03/16/2023 10:41 PM] Bullskey#0000
(re @glasgowm : *reserve*) 
 
 why would the fees go back in reserve instead of distributing to sigmaRSV holders ?


[03/16/2023 10:41 PM] glasgowm#0000
sigmaRSV is the reserve


[03/16/2023 10:41 PM] glasgowm#0000
essentially, hence RSV.


[03/16/2023 10:42 PM] Bullskey#0000
(re @glasgowm : *sigmaRSV is the reserve*) 
 
 so the Holders get the fees through the reserve when redeeming

and not through dividends

Introducing SigmaUSD.io the first UTxO-based stable coin - an instantiation of Djed.

Its economic model designed in partnership between IOHK, Ergo, and Emurgo maintains the conservative settings for collateral reserves and avoids the need for liquidations. Along with that, it supports a fully decentralised stablecoin emission setup.

 The fees go into the reserve, which RSV tokens represent. More fees = more valuable RSV tokens


[03/16/2023 11:00 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
But you have to consider that people using sigusd to short can also capture that reserve liquidity, so it's not so straightforward


[03/16/2023 11:06 PM] glasgowm#0000
(re @Bullskey : *anyone has an answer to this ?*) 
 
 Speeding up the oracle was the more impactful part of the fix, so he wasn‚Äôt able to front-run it. Doubling the fee just meant it was twice as hard for a market manipulator to profit as they would need to shift the price by ~4%+ and keep it down long enough for the oracle to catch up.


[03/16/2023 11:07 PM] Bullskey#6363

Didn‚Äôt drop below ~250%, worked as expected. Some shorters profiting but not much since patch. Some concerns about RSV viability but also had long down-turns to contend with so hard to tell if it was just bad timing.

 Creating ownership results in middlemen. Removing middlemen is the main value proposal of crypto.

Therefore, no funding is the best, but also limits the builders to volunteers.

I would like to see teams explore a hybrid approach. Pay out profits to builders and early risk takers, but not forever. 

For example, taper off the fees going to token holders ovet time, and use them to boost protocol security instead.

I agree. There are issues of transparency in COTI's Djed. It is hard to find information about some critical details. I know three people in COTI and two people from IOHK who are involved in that implementation. (I myself have been distant from it for quite a while.) I don't believe those people are maliciously hiding information. Still, it is an issue that needs to be fixed anyway. My beliefs don't matter.

@Vesi Hiisi, would you like to compile a list of things that are unclear in COTI's Djed or any misleading statements that you found and share them with me? When I have a chance to talk to one of the people I know, I would ask them to clarify what is unclear and fix the misleading statements.

By the way, there are also things in SigmaUSD that are not immediately clear and difficult to find. For example, for a long time I thought that SigmaUSD was immutable, but then one day I found out that there are a few people in the Ergo community with keys that would allow them to change the contract.  Another important point is that the Djed paper assumes a perfect oracle, but on Ergo the oracle has a non-negligible delay.


[03/17/2023 7:03 PM] Bruno#0000
There are always some differences between an implementation and the abstract protocol. The real world forces us to make some compromises. Since the abstract protocol is public research and there can be many implementations and deployments of Djed, this difficulty to find reliable information about discrepancies between implementations and the protocol or about implementation details is probably going to be a constant challenge.

One of the things that I would like the Djed Alliance to do is to provide independent, objective and impartial information about such details and discrepancies. I'm preparing a page about this, with information about SigmaUSD, COTI's Djed, and the upcoming Milkomeda Djed for now.  I would appreciate help from the SigmaUSD community to provide and check facts about SigmaUSD in this page. (To anyone here who is very knowledgeable about details of SigmaUSD and would like to contribute to this page, I would appreciate if you could contact me.)


[03/17/2023 7:06 PM] Bruno#0000

> The name choice is asserting dominance that does not encourage cooperation.

What do you mean, @Vesi Hiisi?

>  Why is it called djed alliance instead of ageusd alliance?

People from Emurgo and Ergo were working on the implementation of the stablecoin for Ergo and the same people from Emurgo would later work on an implementation for Cardano.

The people from Emurgo (who are now at dcSpark) proposed the names ageUSD for the implementation on Ergo and belUSD for the implementation on cardano, after the myth of the Egyptian twins Agenor and Belus.

So, at least originally, ageUSD was an implementation/deployment name, not a protocol name.

So, "ageUSD Alliance" would sound strange from this point of view. Given that USD is not the only possible peg for a Djed deployment, "ageUSD Alliance" would also be limiting, like any name focused on USD only.

I have the impression that, after the Ergo community decided to call the implementation/deployment "SigmaUSD", the name "ageUSD" may have acquired the status of an abstract protocol name within the Ergo community. On the other hand, I see that TokenJay seems to avoid the "SigmaUSD" and refers to the deployment as "ageUSD".  (I would appreciate if people who are more familiarized with this matter could clarify this for me.)

The name "Djed" only appeared in July 2021, when the paper was made public. Back then, there were some other implementations inside IOHK that were named after Egyptian gods.  So, with Egyptian gods, Agenor and Belus in my subconscious mind, it was natural for me to tend towards Egyptian mythology when looking for a symbol of stability.

To me, "Djed" is the name of a family of abstract protocols and it is fine for versions, implementations and deployments to have other names. It can also become confusing, though.  I hope the Djed Alliance can help reduce this confusion.


[03/17/2023 7:42 PM] Bruno#0000

 It was originally immutable, but after it had to be relaunched governance was added as there was an active attacker and having to relaunch again if something went wrong would've been too painful.

[03/17/2023 7:50 PM] Bruno#0000
OK. This "SHEN minimal price" is probably the `P^min_RC` from equation 6 in the white paper. It would be better to refer to this parameter as "minimum buying price". Referring to it as only "minimum price" is indeed misleading.

 I was not aware of all this naming backround. Thanks.

Djed is the name of the stablecoin on Cardano. At least in public perception.

Calling the alliance after one participant does not sound like an alliance. Again, even though it makes sense in your mind, the public probably perceives Djed as the stablecoin, not as a family of abstract protocols.

For example, how would it sound to have Liqwid alliance instead of Cardano defi alliance?

For example, suppose BTC has more liquidity and more adoption than XMR. This means that more people are accepting BTC than XMR. If a merchant accepts to sell you some goods and allows to pay in BTC or XMR, which one would you choose?  If liquidity is important for you and it is the only differentiating criterion, then it would make sense for you to pay for the goods in XMR (the "worse" currency) and keep BTC (the "better" currency) in your wallet. Because BTC has higher liquidity, you might encounter merchants who accept only BTC, but not XMR. So, by spending XMR and keeping BTC, you maximize your chances of being able to buy goods from more merchants in the future. Choosing BTC in this case is a rational choice.

But, what is "better" or "worse" is subjective. For example, maybe privacy is more important to you than liquidity. So, you might be willing to spend your BTC when you can in transactions where you don't care to be traced and keep your XMR to maximize your chances of avoiding tracing. This would be a situation where for you, XMR is the "better" currency.


[03/17/2023 8:52 PM] Bullskey#0000
But people do not even know which one is better simply because the products are different, some people prefer BTC, because they think transparency is key vs people who think Privacy is key, there will always be people who prefer one rather than the other. Also you are assuming that people entering hold both, Many people could potentially only ever interact with one, and so that would be the one they collateralize with and redeem back into


[03/17/2023 9:48 PM] Bruno#0000
I see. It is a tricky situation. My preference would be to reserve "Djed" only for the abstract protocols and for every deployment to have different names, like SigmaUSD.  But, "Djed" is not trademarked and people are free to include this word in the names of their deployments.

Historically, the name "Djed" was first associated with the abstract protocols. The name first appeared in the paper published in eprint. Eprint provides a reliable timestamp and this timestamp precedes anything ever published about COTI's Djed. The Djed Alliance is named after the paper and the abstract protocols, not after COTI's Djed.

Beside's COTI's Djed, there is also an upcoming deployment on Milkomeda that will very probably have "djed" in its name too. This is based on a solidity implementation that was started by dcSpark, by the people who contributed to ageUSD and who intended to do belUSD. So, in a way, one could consider it to be belUSD, the twin of ageUSD.

So, if this Milkomeda deployment indeed ends up having "Djed" on its name, then the perception that we are "calling the alliance after one participant" would be resolved, because there would be two participants with "djed" in their name.  But other perception issues might arise. For instance, people might wonder why "SigmaUSD" does not have "Djed" in its name.

I am also starting to have conversations with other EVM-compatible blockchains, whose communities might be interested in the deployment of this implementation on their chains. And I am also starting to have conversations with non-EVM blockchains, to support implementations in other smart contract languages. These deployments, if they occur, may or may not end up having "djed" in their names.


[03/17/2023 9:49 PM] Bruno#0000
Being impartial to and supportive of all implementations and deployments of Djed is a very strong principle of the Djed Alliance. It is so strong that maintaining this principle has actually been very costly for me and for the Djed Alliance.

I think the challenge is to change the public perception. It is not easy, but I think we can do this together if those among us who know the early history of our collaboration make it clear and well-known. I would appreciate help from SigmaUSD contributors who might know some details that I don't. I think this is very important, especially to ensure that SigmaUSD has the prominent status that it deserves as the first ever deployment of the protocol (and by more than 2 years!).

[03/18/2023 9:22 AM] Bruno#0000
* It allows the simultaneous sale of stablecoins and reservecoins, as long as the reserve ratio does not decrease. This reduces the inconvenience of reservecoin holders becoming unable to sell back their reservecoins to the contract when the reserve ratio is lower than the minimum threshold.

* It introduces a maximum transaction amount limit for minting and burning. This should add some friction against large transactions aimed at causing reserve drainage (though, of course, an attacker can still automate the submission of many smaller transactions) and it is a feature that may also be used to make a Djed deployment more AML compliant.

@Vesi Hiisi , statements like this in the article from COTI that you shared above are really unfair to SigmaUSD, since SigmaUSD already existed. And this statement is quite incoherent, since the whitepaper itself already prominently mentioned SigmaUSD in the section about implementations. (It makes one wonder if those who wrote the article even read the whitepaper.)

Such statements distort the public perception. One of the Djed Alliance's most important goals is to prevent such history distortions.

 I talked to someone making videos for Djed/Coti and now they mention SigUSD sometimes (e.g., when they take one of the infographics made by the community and only change the colors).


[03/18/2023 12:17 PM] Bruno#0000
> Simultaneous mint/burn is awesome.

Yes. Note that this implementation only has simultaneous burn. It doesn't have simultaneous mint.

However, creating a version of the protocol where we have only simultaneous burn and mint and the 4 cases of minting/burning the coins separately are just standard cases of the simultaneous mint/burn operations is something that I would like to do in the future.

In fact, when Ergo, Emurgo and I were researching and developing the protocol back in 2020, discussing it in Emurgo's slack channel, the first implementation that I did in Scala had a single very general mint/burn operation. But it was quite complex and we decided, for the sake of implementation simplicity on ErgoScript, to design a version with 4 separate operations.

> How does it help with AML?

AML guidelines usually allow financial institutions to execute transactions below a certain limit without scrutinizing the origin of the funds and other details of the transaction.  So, by having a transaction limit parameter, this implementation may allow deployments to set this parameter according to the AML guidelines.

But, anyway, AML is much more than just transaction limits.

> I think AML and regulation focus will shift from single projects to the chain level soon.

I agree, for better or for worse. The chain level is the one where transactions are processed. So, it is the closest analogue to what traditional financial institutions do. The individual projects just write code that is executed at the chain level. The challenge, for regulators of each jurisdiction, is that the chain level tends to be more decentralized and not subject to just one jurisdiction.

 I think this is generally correct. The peg is 0.98. On dex the arb incentives kick in between 0.98 and 1.02.

Reserve holders carry the risk, and provide the service of stability. They need to be compensated somehow.

How would you make it work without fees?


[03/18/2023 12:45 PM] Bullskey#6363

(re  : *<Bullskey> I wish I could figure out an answer, is this something being worked on ?*) 
 
 First it should make some sense in theory.

The idea of protocol owned reserve can reduce the fees to a capitally inefficient level, that investors would not accept.

However, even that would not fully remove fees.


[03/18/2023 12:52 PM] Bullskey#6363
Maybe we can create an arbing bot that gets reduced fees ?  when people stake with that bot, it helps arb, and the fees are lower since it has a specific purpose, the bot should also take a % of the profits, that would help build up the treasury

[03/18/2023 12:56 PM] question86#0000
(re  : *<Bullskey> does anyone have an answer for the points I raised above ?*) 
 
 In my opinion, the incentive for SigUSD buyers and holders should never be to exchange their value only in the bank, but on the secondary market (spectrum and other defi options). This goes for all AgeUSD protocol stablecoins i guess. With low but static fees like in SigUSD 2.0 the incentive to mint SigRSV and therefore open up the protocol for more adoption is just not attractive enough. Also, drain attacks on the ERG reserve in the AgeUSD protocol can harm the underlying economy.

 Ah sorry i maybe misunderstood. I wanted to point out that taking SigUSD from the secondary market to exchange it at the SigUSD bank for gains is not useful for the ecosystem as a whole because it takes liquidity out of the whole ecosystem.

[03/18/2023 1:04 PM] Bullskey#6363
treasury would generate more revenue and the stable will now be hard pegged, also we wont need to cut the fees


[03/18/2023 1:04 PM] question86#0000
Best solution in my opinion to improve SigUSD experience would not be to burn the key but to hand it over to a DAO where SigRSV holders can change the fees to mint and burn SigUSD dynamically based on market conditions. It would improve the SigRSV side since they could protect themselves from drain attacks and insane permanent loss of value while keeping SigUSD accessible on secondary markets.

The economic field of literature is in wide agreement that stability of a monetary system is conducive for strong and sustainable economic development. People are more likely to invest, trade and trust each other, when they don‚Äôt have to worry about strong fluctuations in their asset values. A monetary policy is most stable, when it is transparent, predictable and independent of other goals than price stability. This is why central banks device rules (e.g. gold standard) or complicated models to justify their decisions. However, they always retain the right to use human judgement to override those rules. Superficially, it seems like a good idea to have room to maneuver in times of crisis, but history has proven this intuition wrong every time. Gold has outlived every man-made currency. Stability stems from the fact that no one entity can change the monetary policy of gold. The lack of human judgement is exactly what makes it predictable and stable. Therefore, those who want to govern a stable monetary policy have it all backwards. Human judgement is not the source of stability in turbulent times. It is the source of instability.

We can make it so the bot only arbs when reserve is above X, so the stable is only hard pegged above X, we can also introduce a risk calculation where the bot only arbs if certain conditions are met. If we dont want to give the bot access to treasury we allow people to stake with the bot and the bot gets x% of all profits that go to treasury, or for the bot to fund itself.

 I see the point but i dont think it will grow organically without giving power to the SigRSV investors in exchange for higher risk assumptions. At the moment, SigRSV holders have both higher risk and less gains over period of time. So adoption will fail. If they have the voting power over the fees to mint and burn SigUSD, secondary market gets activated while SigUSD value on DEXs is protected. It should not be the bank where people go to make money.

 I agree that the incentives are not there for rsv holders.

My preference would be to push them out by accumulating protocol owned reserves.

In my view, that is the only way to achieve high enough collateral for stability. If left to markets, or DAO, they will always opt for too much risk.

 The 400% and 800% rules should not be changed after 2 years, people got used to it and these limits mark constants in the protocol which is important. In tradfi, banks tend to go for too much risk in times with too much liquidity in the market but this is something that can not happen in AgeUSD. SigRSV holders would not be able to create new SigUSD just by being able to vote on the fees for minting and burning SigUSD. Think about it. Everything in the protocol is working nice so far except for the possibility to drain the reserves at very very good conditions. You can exchange X amount of SigUSD via bank contract without volume affecting price -> this is a weakness because it prefers big short players over many small investors.


[03/18/2023 2:02 PM] question86#0000
No idea how this change could negatively affect the risk layer of the protocol.


[03/18/2023 2:06 PM] question86#0000
All it would effectively change is to ask the SigRSV crew to find decent minting and burning fees. Too high -> no new SigUSD, negative for SigRSV holders. Too low -> drain attacks, negative for SigRSV holders. Decent fees -> natural growth of SigUSD in circulation while being able to react on big minting / dumping market price attacks, good for SigRSV holders, neutral for "normie" SigUSD holders they can go secondary market, good for ecosystem liquidity overall.

 I thought of more general governance than just changing the fee.

The reference was to dropping the 400% limit for more capital efficiency.

Only changing fee makes more sense, but there might be some weird corner cases.

For example, BW could buy controlling share of rsv and vote for 50% fee. Now sigusd holders would face a choice of selling for half price, or holding a stablecoin that no one wants to use.

Dynamic fees might be a more eloquent way to find market optimized fees.

 Yes, the 400% limit should not be changed at all. And yeah, there may be scenarios i did not think about, i just try to get in the head of a potential SigRSV buyer (and these guys are in the end the people that determine the outcome for AgeUSD) and what is the biggest point of failure at the moment. People like me (and probably you too) went in SigUSD version 1 and 2 to participate in the growth of the ecosystem while getting their small share of the users via fees, not to get hands on monopoly money. The question is how to make these fees dynamic so they can adopt to the various market scenarios. Maybe it can also be automated without human decisionmaking. In your scenario, BW would actually kill his own investment narrative when he/she buys heavily into SigRSV. Yes, there would be the possibility that entities get a lot of voting power but these would also carry the biggest risk. So that would be some kind of tradfi but without the money printing aspect.

(re @question86 : *How? SigUSD holders still can go on ErgoDex, sigmafi or the other stuff. He could not get his hands on these SigUSD getting traded. Liquidity providers on spectrum would get buffed. SigUSD in my perception is a hedge against a drop in Ergo price. If i have to do this trading via ErgoDex or AgeUSD makes no difference for me.*) 
 
 Holders would rush to the dex and sell until 0.5$.

Now as a holder, you can hold, but no one will want to integrate the failed sigusd anywhere. Some might prefer to sell.

Any sell will give profits to the BW.

Now consider BW announces raising fee to 75% next week. Would you still hold?

 I think i get the point now, good one, havent thought of this one. Could be addressed with diminishing return on the amount of SigRSV you hold compared to circulating supply. But two points would be mandatory in your example: BW would show himself in the DAO and would not be anon anymore, same time the amount of circulating SigUSD would have to be way bigger than right now to make stuff like this attractive, at this time there probably are some other bigger players involved already.

 Any profit makes it attractive.

One could simply use multiple wallets.


[03/18/2023 3:09 PM] question86#0000
Well it only is attractive IF holders start to run for the secondary market which again would buff the secondary markets supply compared to the bank, and again, he would have to buy up all the way to 800% RR keeping the SigRSV for himself without the option to sell them via DEX. But ok, there are variants to keep that event from happening: Maximum % change of the fees per epoch / timeframe X, transparency reports from the DAO about the decisionmaking process, option to redeem in advance of a % change.


[03/18/2023 4:03 PM] Bullskey#6363
Why would it be hard to set it up in an immutable way ?


[03/18/2023 4:05 PM] Bullskey#6363
I think we all agree that we need to give more value to sigRSV, however I dont think the answer is to make a DAO and give it to them.

[03/19/2023 9:42 PM] Bullskey#6363
I am only looking at 2 issues here, 
1- the token is not truly hard pegged because it is not profitable to arb too close to 1$, so we now have a range in which the stable can be without getting arbed back
2- SigRSV Clearly needs more utility, I did not make any suggestions on that topic yet but suggestions from other members (that I disagree with) was to make a DAO. I believe sigRSV should maybe have a product of itself so it has organically more demand.


[03/19/2023 9:42 PM] Bullskey#6363

Some thoughts on the ideal stablecoin

1. A stablecoin should not be pegged to Fiat as it's constantly being printed

2. Shouldn't be pegged to gold as we don't know the max supply or how much is actually in government vaults https://www.reuters.com/article/uganda-gold-idUSKBN2NP17M

3. I like the idea of pegging it to the 200 week moving average of ergo. thoughts?

4. It should be backed by Ergo only.

5. Let's lock the code and avoid human governance. In code we trust, not humans.

6. What about putting a time delay on orders to mint SigUSD or SigRSV? 10% of the order could be fulfilled every hour.

7. What about giving the protocol itself a tiny edge in arbitrage and any profits would be sent into the reserves.

Thank you for joining my TED Talk.

...*) 
 
 1. Agree on an ideological level. Disagree in practice. There is demonstrated high demand on usd pegged coins.

2. Gold has the longest lindy effect in keeping stable purchasing power. It has its shortcomings, but I dont see any better alternatives.

Except a basket of good following the purchasing power. However, that requires management, which removes immutability. Also, oracle tech is not reliable enough to do that yet.

3. I dont see the use case. Its still volatile, and the design incentivizes swing trading.

4. Agree. Btc would be better, but not worth the bridge risk.

5. Agree. Improvement only via new deployments. (Some grace time ok for new products, but strict plan needed to remove gov.)

6. I like the idea of a delay. It further mitigates drain opportunities. 

7. This is a good idea, but not sure how technically feasible?

 Bridge is more capitally efficient. I would imagine those getting more liquidity in dexes.

Security-wise, its oracle vs. Bridge. Also, the sigBTC governance and erg as backing.

        *Oracle is prone to manipulation now*. There now are only maximum 4 which is the minimum for SigUSD to be able to  work and *recently there were often less than 4 and so the Oracle stopped. Any plans to fix this?* Second question. *There is a bot and when it interacts with SigUSD it is not working for the normal user like yesterday! *I can understand this when RR is below 400 aproaching 400 but not when it should work for all user the same which it does not! *IMHO this is a exploit going on.

[04/26/2023 3:49 PM] question86#0000
Sigmafi might be a nice catalyst for a more bullish narrative on SigRSV since it increases demand for SigUSD. Some of these SigUSD might be locked up for quite a while aswell within the contracts. So maybe the protocol wont see any huge free "minting gaps" above 400% RR anymore, making it more resilient to worthy draining attacks.


[04/26/2023 3:52 PM] kushti#0000
Also sigusd now can be used for erg offramping, so you mint sigusd without affecting the price and then slowly converting sigusd into usdt to get cash after


[04/26/2023 3:55 PM] question86#0000
Well we see 20% + offers as interest on these loans, so the demand is definately there for SigUSD on various fronts now. Even 35% which is totally insane for such a relatively "save" way to earn extra. I am just excited to see how this will affect SigRSV performance, in the end i hope Cafebeduin comes out on top from a year-long discussion.

it looks like it's not, well, assembling. Even if it has enough for fees.

I might've just not been patient enough tho

Can be an issue when it's busy with the assembler. Can also buy via tokenjay via the mobile wallet or Minotaur.

Also sigusd now can be used for erg offramping, so you mint sigusd without affecting the price and then slowly converting sigusd into usdt to get cash after
