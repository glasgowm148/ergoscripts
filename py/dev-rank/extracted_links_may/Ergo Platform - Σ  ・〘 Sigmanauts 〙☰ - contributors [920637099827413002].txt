Hi everyone, I am thrilled to be here. Before being accepted into this cohort, I started writing an article for my blog which is tentatively titled "Ergo, a Better Bitcoin - Why BTC maximalists should take note". It would go on to explain BTC's Taproot update and how it compares with the extended value Ergo brings. Does an article like this fit into the goals of this program?


[12/23/2021 7:36 AM] cozycole#5064
I also would very much like to help with some of Ergo's outdated text but not sure where to start.


[12/23/2021 9:00 AM] pluto#7604
Hello @cozycole , I remember asking root7Z about a specific blogpost on ergoplatform.org which has now disappeared. 
He told me that there was a bit of critisism because of the comparitive tone against bitcoin in the blogpost so the post was re-edited. I don't know if he is in here but I would love to find out more about that. Maybe he can also tell you more on where to start.

The official ergo site couldn't publish anything like as @pluto said, BTC maximalists go nuts even if we use some language that could be interpreted as ERG being superior so not worth the effort lol. 

Of course, you're free to write about whatever you want on your blog. But the incentive structure isn't set up for this properly yet. Maybe require tracking with a bit.ly link or something. 

@AngieHar can tell you more about the Contributors programme that's mentioned in the on-boarding doc if you'd like to try it out.


[12/23/2021 2:40 PM] glasgowm#9381
could try fixing up the manifesto a bit. Was combined from old blog posts, some of kushti's words. Probably way too technical

Manifesto
The Ergo Manifesto hopes to educate and offer a vision of what blockchain technology can achieve. We hope to build society through horizontal cooperation through production under the division of labor, trade and exchange, and solidarity and mutual aid. We believe this is achievable while maintain...

Good tool for pulling people in. Especially non-technical people imo if it's done right.

@glasgowm I thought it might be a little polarizing. I'll keep that one to myself haha.


[12/23/2021 7:26 PM] cozycole#5064
I'd love to help with the manifesto. I like the blurb you sent in the image. Are you looking for an extension of that? As in creating another manifesto for those less technically inclined? Or just changing the original?


[12/23/2021 7:27 PM] cozycole#5064
I see. Thanks for the insight. I'll try to reach out to root7Z.


[12/24/2021 7:17 AM] hedges#1221
hey @glasgowm a couple questions. after reading through the Sigmanaut Onboarding docs, I'm curious if Ergo or anyone at the foundation has any fully formed pitches for articles that they've been looking to get out. If not would here be the best place to pitch some story ideas, so other members could have an opinion?

My other questions concerns editorial changes to the Sigmanaut Onboarding doc. I noticed a few grammatical errors and sentence-level concerns that could be re-written. Would it be okay if I had a go? I'm a writer by trade. Teaching at university-level and plenty of freelance experience


[12/24/2021 12:09 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah feel free. @AngieHar runs the contributors programme which is the structured version paid per word. I'll ping her elsewhere and get her to check Discord

Hey guys, glad to have you all here and nice to e-meet you! @hedges @cozycole @pluto 
Let‚Äôs chat in direct messages with everyone separately so I can explain our workflow and then duplicate common conditions here to stay on the same page

Re-Forwarding and pinning. This can also be seen on the sigmanauts onboarding document. Relevant resources, FAQs, etc. Will be added here. (Please also feel free to add!).

**Editorial contributor's program **

Like many projects, the Ergo Platform has its own editorial team to support and grow marketing efforts. The Ergo editorial team taps into the opinions of the team, ecosystem, perspectives, and insights of industry leaders for  diverse range of content to be published on Ergo‚Äôs media sources. 

This takes form in 600-1000 word submissions on trend analysis/ comparative technical analysis, news of the defi market, and/or strategic advice. After submissions are received they are edited to ensure consistent quality across Ergo‚Äôs blog and social media platforms. 
You should strive to offer commentary on the blockchain industry for the purposes of promoting and creating a dialogue about the tools and projects the Ergo Platform is building. Editorial contributors work closely with practitioners who are actively involved in product development or executive leadership within the ecosystem to get as much information as possible and push the content delivery. 

To ease our work there are a few guidelines for productive cooperation: 
1. we post at least 3 articles a week ( be sure to confirm your publication at least 1 day before publishing)
2. social media posts should be homogeneus and reflect values of Ergo, while attempting to be fun and offer an entertaining tone 
3. don't forget to include keywords and make eye-catchy headlines
4. in the case of media coverage, the economic impact of Ergo should be considered a priority. 
5. Assertive and well-backed opinions on strategy, comparative technical analysis or product development approaches usually perform well.
6. show examples and tell stories
7. deliver all the content in GoogleDocs, including short texts for social media Telegram and Twitter 
8. don't forget to use your sense of humor to boost connections with the audience

After the confirmation of the piece from our editor, a contributor receives 20 USDT per 150 words. Payments are made once a month.

There are a few ideas on content type 

How To's 
Lists
Expert content/ op-ed
Company News 
Infographics ( help can be requested in our graphic team to make it nice) 
Giveaways ( also can be considered as additional ideas) 
FAQs 
Q&A / AMA sessions wrap ups 
Dictionary ( different complex words to simplify and explain to the community, also can be designed for social media) 
Day in the Life of Post - storytelling 
Interview 
Press Releases
Predictions / Opinion  
Timeline/ Roadmap
Comparative technical analysis with different other blockchains ( PoW) 
Technical tutorials

Much of Ergo's text is outdated, and written by non-natives or programmers. We need fresh content that can make Ergo understandable and accessible to everyone.

So how does this group operate? Are there tasks delegated? Or do we pitch ideas to write about?


[02/05/2022 12:46 AM] sean_ergonaut#0000
We‚Äôre in the process of putting together guidelines for future articles and will share soon.  I imagine next week we‚Äôll know what that final doc looks like. Do you have something in particular you are wanting to write about? :) (re @TIMRŒ£G7: So how does this group operate? Are there tasks delegated? Or do we pitch ideas to write about?)


[02/05/2022 1:17 AM] cafebedouin#0000
Lets see, I've written Why Ergo? which WordPress says has had about a 1,500 views, Forecasting a Cryptocurrency Price, which focuses on Ergo and has had about 900 views and Mining the Ergo Cryptocurrency in the ergo.getblok.Iowa mining pool, which has about a 110 views. I helped clean up Ergodex's readme, early on. And, I've been "helping" with writing or rewriting various documents in the ecosystem. So, the challenge, for me, is not so much what I'd like to write about. I'm already doing that. The question is what is this group doing, and how might I help with that?


[02/05/2022 1:52 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I have some ideas. I like the "Ergo & the Lessons of..." format I used in my other article. I also like the privacy and equity aspect of Ergo. These would be easy and enjoyable to write about (re @sean_ergonaut: We‚Äôre in the process of putting together guidelines for future articles and will share soon.

[02/05/2022 1:54 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Also something on the history of money, culminating in ergo. History is easy to write about in an engaging way and it would make the advancement of crypto obviously beneficial


[02/05/2022 2:04 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I enjoyed your articles btw. Should have more than 1500 views. That's about what mine has now. Pretty proud of the average read time, actually. It's almost 8 minutes! An eternity on the internet (re @cafebedouin: Lets see, I've written Why Ergo? which WordPress says has had about a 1,500 views, Forecasting a Cryptocurrency Price, which focuses on Ergo and has had about 900 views and Mining the Ergo Cryptocurrency in the ergo.getblok.Iowa mining pool, which has about a 110 views.

TIMRŒ£G7 Thanks! I enjoyed reading your piece on Bitcoin maxis as well. Probably helps to publish on something like Medium to increase view, but I prefer to have a bit more control. But, depends on what you are doing.


[02/05/2022 2:54 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000

[02/07/2022 3:29 AM] sean_ergonaut#0000
so this group will cover community and ecosystem stories as they arise. You can also write articles that deal with future use cases for Ergo. It's great to see all the things you've already written, thank you! I feel like I would like this group to draw inspiration and write about what excites you. I'll have the writer's guide early this week to share but there's no reason not to write something now if you're inspired. Articles should be no longer than 1-2 pages max (readers tend to tune out if it's too long). If you have something longer you want to write about, make it as 2-3 part series of articles. I think it's great if you offer something like an EIL5 article or if you want to help provoke curiousity about Ergo.
It's totally ok to write about things that may have been covered in previous articles before. As time goes on, it's always good for readership to have up-to-date articles on topics. If you do write about something that has already been covered a while ago, just be sure to cite it (use of hyperlinks is appropriate for this).

I just watched the developer update where Armeanio mentions that morphic is writing up a paper where he was torn between two audiences, his peers and the general reader. If no one is already working on it, I'd like to see what he has written about what he is doing and see if it can be made accessible to a general audience at around 500 words.

So, since I've never worked in this group before and this article is perhaps a bit out of my technical depth. I figured I'd put the first draft to the group, so that someone with better mastery of the technical details can determine whether this is, in broad strokes, accurate. Also, it'll provide some opportunity for the editorial group to tell me what needs to happen to get in house style of the group. This is a once through. I typically then do three to four editing periods before publishing. Also, I'm not ued to collaborating via Google Docs, so I may not have set the permissions right. Please let me know if I need to enable editing or something.

Hi, overall sound great, just left a couple of comments.


[02/07/2022 10:47 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Made some changes and cleaned up the piece a bit. I'll probably do two more read-throughs and polish it up a bit tomorrow. Any additional comments would be appreciated.

[02/07/2022 11:59 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Another idea: Wallet overview. Description of the use cases of different wallets. Nautilus is focused on privacy and ledger integration. safew as a dApp connector with Ergopay that allows for interacting with a dApp on the web and signing via Android wallet. Yoroi? Probably be best to write that for Ergonaught.space, wait to see how they develop given Ergohack and just the speed of both of their development, and how they mature before putting out any kind of official article on either.

[02/09/2022 5:13 AM] hedges#1221
that's a nice read. I'm gonna toss some thoughts here mainly about the headings, but first I'd like to share my impressions to see how a first read through looks. The article introduces the two methods for counting cost. I'm curious if cost should be left as a non-count noun, so minus the *s*. Then in the second section mainly talks about the advantages of AOT, and the last paragraph addresses the disadvantages of AOT that can be solved with JIT.

I wonder if the headers can be more descriptive, so the header Ahead of Time Costing could be "A Look at the Advantages and Disadvantages of AOT-cost" and the second header which I think is already pretty descriptive, though it could benefit from mentioning *hybrid*, *JIT*, or any other keywords. 

Just some thoughts, overall a nicely written article. Curious to hear your or anyone else's thoughts on descriptive headers or anything else.

yeah `Ergo‚Äôs New Hybrid Method for Counting Costs` might be better. First one maybe too long. Think descriptive is generally better - if it can also be concise.

Given all the work morphic did with the initial write-up and his corrections on the piece, Sean's editing and your title suggestion, I'm not sure I deserve much credit on that one. 
I agree storage rent needs a one sheet. There are parts of it I don't understand. For example, how does storage rent handle tokens? Are they left alone until the box is closed out? And if so, what happens then?  
I'd be happy to try my hand at it. What is HF? Is there a canonical document on storage rent? (re @glasgowm: congrats @cafebedouin and well done breaking that concept down.

So, a couple of questions. Is it possible to fix the headings and weird paragraph spacing? The previous one also had a weird paragraph spacing, but I wasn't going to raise an issue about it. However, since I am bringing it up for the second, I'd figure I'd mention the first as well. Another problem is that it looks like Medium is auto-sizing the image on the second article, so it looks bad. I can get you one with a higher pixel count, if that would help. Let me know how I can help fix that issue. (re @sean_ergonaut: We got your article published today! Thanks!)


[02/23/2022 2:49 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
So on the blog, it looks the weird spacing is due to an extra spaces you may have edited while writing in Google docs? (ie. page breaks). I'll look into getting that fixed. I can't find the medium article that I posted for some reason. It's not showing anymore. I have no idea why. I'll repost it but if you want to send a higher pixel image, that would be great (re @cafebedouin: So, a couple of questions. Is it possible to fix the headings and weird paragraph spacing?

Forwarded from seedubya: Hoping to kick start the sigmanuts, 
I'm looking for a couple of sigmanaut writers and a graphic designer to help with Twitter posts on the ErgoPlatformOrg account.
I plan to create weekly Twitter threads on everything Ergo called deciphering ergo or the ergo code. 
They're designed to be read as an eli1, simplify a topic or feature. No techy buzz words, simple explanations and real-life examples of use cases. The aim is to reach the everyday person.
Will structure the threads as follows
Tweet 1 short intro plus infographic to grab attention
Tweet 2 to 8/10 explanation
Last tweet references sigmanaut article or existing article/blog
We have a treasure trove of information in the existing articles/blogs. It's a matter of simplifying, with examples, to the point everyday people can read and comprehend.
Please reach out and contribute 
Cheers

Hey Everyone,
Please let me know your thoughts on contributing articles over the next couple of weeks. We have a pipeline forming in the Editorial group so those of you who crossover to that group, don't worry about this message.
I need to know who is looking to write something on a weeekly/bi-weekly basis. Let's get articles that focus on:
- simple technical explanations (let's keep articles short and clear)
- community projects and initiatives - this can be anything in the community! üôÇ
Suggested technical topics if you feel you have the expertise:
- eUTXO
- interoperability
- stablecoin
- dApp connector
- ErgoPay
- comparative anaylsis with the tools of other blockchains in the industry
These are obviously board in scope, but it would be nice to have short articles that focus on a few aspects of a topic rather than the whole picture. If it becomes a topic you want to run with and have a lot you would like to convey, we can turn it into a series of articles. 
Please reply to this message with your thoughts.
B, glad to have you join! Sorry I haven't introduced myself sooner! We will utilize your editing expertise with these projects if you're up for it.
Cheers!

Consistent question seems to come up that shows the metaphor of wallets tends to have people think their assets are "in" a particular wallet, rather than a wallet being more like a blockchain browser, with the seed phrase being the password, and the spending password being the decryption key for the stored hash of that password. Probably needs something explaining derived addresses. Anyway, just thought it worth a mention.

I've seen a question in this ballpark at least 5 times on Ergopad. The stake key is sometimes being moved about as people switch wallets and don't clear cache on the dApp connector. It's not something obvious to do. And, it's confusing a lot of folks because they don't have a good mental model of how the wallet, dApp connector, and dApp process work together. It might help to have an article that talks about it, so folks using the chain understand it better.

[03/28/2022 7:24 AM] CM Mongo#6235
sorry! I was working on mining/autolykos, for the introduction I was thinking of going over what a consensus protocol is exactly, main ones used (pow/pos) and then leading into introducing autolykos and for the body portion elaborate into autolykos in simple language and mining using the algorithim,  get into the specifics (asic resistant, lower energy etc) ,

for the example portion I was thinking of looking into the energy output for btc mining vs erg mining if i can find reliable values and maybe mention asic resistant again

last conclusion part - summarizing autolykos strengths vs other consensus protocols - links to other articles about pow as that is mentioned a lot so maybe people may want to read up on PoW

let me know if you think that sounds okay!


[03/28/2022 8:30 PM] CM Mongo#6235
im discussing 51% attacks and how autolykos is a solution to that

its based on the one list k-sum problem, trying to figure out how to explain it in simple words haha but i dont even get it, so basically autolykos pool-resistance makes it so those looking to create blocks can only do so through simple brute-force, which is id assume impossible?,
was reading through https://ergoplatform.org/docs/whitepaper.pdf
the autolykos consensus protocol lol


[03/28/2022 8:53 PM] cafebedouin#0000
> *(re @ErgoBridgeBot)*: <CM Mongo> im discussing 51% attacks and how a... 
I think the point of autolykos is that it changes, which makes it much more difficult to create specialized mining hardware to get order or magnitude better performance. If you have special hardware, then only professional mining operations can afford it buy it, which concentrates hash power.


[03/28/2022 8:54 PM] CM Mongo#6235
ohh okay, and so asics also play a part in mining pools hitting that 51% of computational power


[03/28/2022 8:57 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Or, to put it differently, if you were able to come up with a way to solve PoW 1000x faster than everyone else, you could build out a 51% attack much easier.


[03/28/2022 8:57 PM] CM Mongo#6235
yeah! thats a good way to put it, thanks for the clarification!


[03/28/2022 11:45 PM] CMMongo#0000
@sean_ergonaut should have my post out for editing by end of today!


[03/29/2022 12:59 AM] CM Mongo#6235
so the pool-resistance of autolykos was voted out in a semi-recent hard-fork right?


[03/29/2022 1:00 AM] seedubya#0000
turning off non-outsourcable puzzles was a hard fork in Feb last year


[03/29/2022 2:02 AM] CM Mongo#6235
okay,
intro - brief talk about consensus protocols pow, pos, and then lead into autolykos anda list of the three problems it aims to provide a solution for

 i split the body up into a problems that were found with the original PoW and explained those problems and a second part for solutions in how autolykos aims to address those problems (51% attacks, asic dominance and coin-hopping attacks)

real-world I was still going to add something, i was looking for something with energy consumption or maybe look for an article showing how widespread asic dominance in bitcoin mining is or something like that

as for conclusion I just made a few points summarizing what I had written out,

Hi Sean, I just wrote up another twitter thread. This time on oracle-pools. I had to take a lot of stuff out and there is a decent amount of old articles on it. Should I make it a little longer and into an article you described?


[03/29/2022 9:33 PM] Mijbil#0000
I put the draft in the twitter-thread document

Sorry been absolutely hectic week. I'll also start going through these pieces to edit. Just finished my first rough draft of "Ergo for my Dad: Wallets" putting it in Google docs now


[03/31/2022 2:59 AM] B#0000
Okay here it is. I'm not perfectly happy with it yet and I absolutely need the technical people to have a read and make sure I haven't made any fundamental misrepresentations of the technology. Also, I'm not married to the analogies I used so if anyone thinks they stink, I won't be offended!

Yep, will do it late this morning/early arvo. Any suggestions on which topic I should do next? My rationale for picking wallets first was for someone who knows nothing but wants to take a practical approach and "just to start". So I was thinking about either the blockchain/smart contracts (and why Ergo's is the best) or what mining is. My feeling is to do blockchain/smart contracts next as cafebedouin just did a great piece for PoW

First of all, I really loved your article. It really hits the mark and it's a very enjoyable read.
As for the topics, there are a few I can think of.
But ime one that comes up a lot is explaining that it is *not* just magic internet money; it is the coin used on an entirely new technology that has the potential to revolutionize everything.

That's a really good point, maybe the blockchain is still too advanced and I should explain what a coin/token is first


[04/06/2022 6:49 AM] B#0000
I remember the very first time I learned about BTC and looked up "how much one costs" and saw that at the time it was a few hundred dollars and so thought I couldn't afford one because I didn't know you could even get fractions of one


[04/06/2022 6:50 AM] JŒµnniŒµ D#0000
I think that is very good too. Ultimately it doesn't matter if it's a series, a lot of people will come to a full repository of these articles and will be able to pick. But a lot of people really do believe that all this space is, is nerds making up coins that then acquire value in a completely senseless way or because of an unpredictable and arbitrary event (see Doge shooting up because of Elon).

Hello there! I hope everyone is well. 

As an ERG miner, I often questioned, what the hell are my GPUs actually doing? Thus, I've spent the past 2 months researching Autolykos and wanted to share my knowledge with the community. I have written an extensive article (10 pages) breaking down the technicalities of the algorithm and have also created an Autolykos graphic. I was in contact with mhs_sam who was very kind to overview the article and said all looks good.

It seems that @sean_ergonaut you are the chief editor, and I am wondering what works best for you? Shall I drop the article and graphic here? Please let me know üôÇ

(re  : *<BrothaChad> [reply]: hey bro, any update on the writeup?*) 
 
 Yes! I was looking through it over a week ago and would like to set it up for publishing as a series on Autolykos. It is too long for one blog post but would be a wonderful way to educate the community (and potential Ergonauts) on the algorithm. 

I'll edit it into several chunks that can be published separately. Is that ok? Let me know if you have any questions and we'll add you to the queue for publishing.

Hey guys, If something isn't already in the works for this...

With upcoming implementation of EIP27, be great to have an article to release at the time explaining the updated tokenomics in present tense (EIP27 implemented). 

A little rework of this maybe

Yeah they're technical changes. If you get oracles v1 the summary bit at the top should be all you need. But it's just some tweaks to its efficiency. Does this by introducing a token, removing some bloat boxes/data-inputs and replacing them with simpler methods

Uses the ErgoPay protocol to interact with dApps. Similar to Nautilus dApp connector but for mobile  - sure @MrStahlfelge would be happy to answer any questions you have.

[08/03/2022 8:03 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
it is my spare time project delivering services that are missing on the ecosystem, both for developers and for users. for example, regarding AgeUSD, it provides a price API to fetch for developers and for users it can build the token swap transactions for ErgoPay. for developers, it also provides a token verification api, and for users a token sale escrow service. I have much more on my planned list but as it will be done using Mosaik I have to wait for Mosaik to be more complete. all these things on my to do list are some kind of utility though, so tokenjay will never be a project with a single goal but more kind of a toolbox both for users and for developers.

once i figure it out ill make the announcement on twitter.


[08/05/2022 2:54 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I think easiest way is for me to screen record the youtube video and then upload like that.


[08/05/2022 2:55 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
So essentially if people can time stamp videos, I can probably do it quite easily.

Agreed walk through are needed. It may seem simple but often people wont ask for little things like this out of fear of being ridiculed.

hi team üëã

I have few updates for you. We are relaunching our content startegy a bit. It will include a new guidelines and specific topics so you could take the ones you like and contribute. It will help us to organise the pipeline and improve the effectiveness of our content management. 

The main idea is to have two pipelines: 
- content for brand awareness 
- and general topics that will help to increase google rankings for our website 

More detailed information will be dropped to this chatroom later on the next week. 
Meanwhile we need to run a test to develop the strategy the most effectively. And therefore i need someone‚Äôs help in this. 

I need a volunteer to write a piece in accordence with the following guidelines and a structure of the text.  

Topic/ title h1: *Bitcoin Mining Rig: Complete Guide*
Introduction
Subtitle h2: *What is a bitcoin mining rig?*
text: speaking about what is bitcoin mining rig
h2: *How to build a bitcoin mining rig*
text: speaking about how to make a bitcoin mining rig 
h2: *How much does a bitcoin mining rig cost?*
text: speaking about all costs aspects 
h2 - *Bitcoing Mining Rig: Conclusion*
text: conclusion


so all in all we need to have one main title, 4 subtitles with explanation text. 
- it‚Äôs okay to embed the information about Ergo ( where nessesary), but it‚Äôs not the main focus
- don‚Äôt forget to use reference links to proof the uniqness of the text since we need to have unique content 
- the length is min 1000 words 

Who would like to participate in such initiative?

(re  : *<jhon_moio> i really like writing, this was a translation however*) 
 
 It sounds like Angie will provide a list of topics, and then, you can write on what interests you. The main thing is that contributions work on a spec work model, meaning that if it is something the Ergo Editorial staff wants and it's more in a journalistic style they will publish it. I don't know how it works for nob-English languages. You may want to talk with Angie or Sean about what you want to write and whether it meets their needs.

Hi all on this chatroom üëã
Hope you‚Äôre doing well! 

Jody wanted to follow up on the topics that were discussed over here. Does anyone prepare anything for blog? Could someone give a preliminary ETA?


[12/05/2022 1:26 PM] chucked1993#0000
I‚Äôve written 1300 words for the cold wallet topic. I‚Äôll try to finish off the first draft today. Then I need to edit it

 So general topics. Should I be working Ergo into these in any capacity?


[12/05/2022 7:55 PM] AngieHar#0000
(re @AffableVillain : *So general topics. Should I be working Ergo into these in any capacity?*) 
 
 Yes ofc 
Ergo has always to be included with a link 
Or for example if we speak about crypto scams within a year or last big cases we go toward the direction speaking about benefits of ergo 
If we speak about crypto slang, we list most commonly used words and also can speak about who are ergonauts for example, etc


[12/05/2022 7:56 PM] AngieHar#0000
Or we have a batch of news also to be covered, but they are specifically on the ecosystem


[12/05/2022 8:30 PM] AffableVillain#0000
(re @AngieHar : *Or we have a batch of news also to be covered, but they are specifically on the ecosystem*)

 Like a recap of manifesto?


[12/19/2022 10:11 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Another idea I got from a fantasy football blog. They have these articles that blindly compare players using statistics only, then they reveal who is who at the end. It's used to give people a reality check on overhyped players and help them realize that some young players are actually really legit.

 I suppose I'd like to talk about some first principles and the 'why' of crypto, then go through all the violations of that seen in FTX, Luna, etc


[12/19/2022 10:13 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Then related it back to the manifesto and why ergo literally cannot rug anyone

 Would you consider to combine it with the topic we mentioned earlier about scams in 2022


[12/19/2022 10:14 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Yeah for sure. I hadn't read the previous messages, but that sounds like what I had in mind.

 principles, trust assumptions and all that jazz. it can be a bit of a mundane topic but needs to be expressed and reiterated. maybe propose questions people should be asking etc

I was thinking of taking the crypto scams one. I am also interested in writing a piece on easy first steps in assessing a crypto project. Things like initial supply distribution, consensus mechanism, contributors/development, etc.

 I think a 'how to avoid scams' piece is super needed


[12/19/2022 10:20 PM] chucked1993#0000
Yea, I was gonna start with history with Mt. Gox and maybe the eth fork. And go over all the stuff from this year, including Luna, Celsius, ftx, possibly tether in future.


[12/19/2022 10:20 PM] chucked1993#0000

(re @seedubya : *the latest max maher video on ergo does this quite well imo. maybe check that out for some inspiration also*) 
 
 I'll have to give it a watch. I always really liked the fantasy football ones because it's so easy to get caught up in the hype of things and not recognize your own biases. I think it could be really powerful to see how Ergo does stand up to Cardano despite being a fraction of its market cap

So the scam article can focus on scams, common crypto investor mistakes and how ergo solves them. Should we have a separate article on what makes a good project and end off with showing how ergo has those characteristics?

I let it be more focused on first principles than the manifesto itself, but end with a focus on Ergo. Lmk if you'd like me to rework the end to be more ergo-centric. and happy new year! I realize you're probably not working now so no rush.

Submitting my draft on crypto slang. I felt like it was the right topic to inject some humor. Please let me know if I've missed the mark. Also, I've never written anything with SEO in mind. I wasn't clear on meta descriptions. Some resources said they're snippets taken from the article, but most of the more popular pages on the topic seem to have just used a list of keywords, so I included that with a brief overview.

looks great! one comment as it would be good to add links to points, meaning where you say about decentralization, trustlessness, self custody, etc to make them more ergo centric to the end of each point so that to provide proofs and grab reader‚Äôs attention, like to add a few practical examples ( or link to them) 

the ending about ergo manifesto maybe needs to be more bright and eye-catchy, maybe add one more intro ergo centric paragraph speaking about core values from manifesto, then a quote and the ending
Sean is better to look at it

 adding these links in made me realize we dont have a lot of content dedicated to these points. I'm grasping at straws a bit here. We could use more  ergo specific content on 'decentralization', trustlessness, self custody, & transparency. Just a blog about why each is important and what ergo does to accomplish it.

Submitting my draft on crypto slang. I felt like it was the right topic to inject some humor. Please let me know if I've missed the mark. Also, I've never written anything with SEO in mind. I wasn't clear on meta descriptions. Some resources said they're snippets taken from the article, but most of the more popular pages on the topic seem to have just used a list of keywords, so I included that with a brief overview.

looks great! one comment as it would be good to add links to points, meaning where you say about decentralization, trustlessness, self custody, etc to make them more ergo centric to the end of each point so that to provide proofs and grab reader‚Äôs attention, like to add a few practical examples ( or link to them) 

the ending about ergo manifesto maybe needs to be more bright and eye-catchy, maybe add one more intro ergo centric paragraph speaking about core values from manifesto, then ...*)

Building blocks of Ergo $ERG Blockchain. Ever heard of these terms, what do we mean by NiPoPoWs? NiPo what??

ErgoScript | UTXO Model | Sigma Protocols | NiPoPoWs | Mining | Ergo Token

Here's my attempt to describe these building blocks which is analogous to web 2.

This info could be helpful as well:


[04/20/2023 7:00 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
sigusd is over-collateralized aye, dexy is seigniorage

It doesn‚Äôt use collateralized by debt positions - which is the difference between MakerDAO

[04/20/2023 7:02 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
I think the link I sent you above might help. Let me know. Thanks!


[04/20/2023 7:25 PM] glasgowm#0000
ChainCash is not a stablecoin in the traditional sense, as it doesn't maintain a fixed value peg. Instead, it operates as a decentralized monetary system that accommodates varying levels of collateralization and trust, enabling elastic money creation and addressing the inelasticity issues associated with conventional blockchain assets. Still good to mention in the article though IMO


[04/20/2023 7:27 PM] chucked1993#0000
I‚Äôll read over the paper to get a better understanding, and try to write something easier to understand
