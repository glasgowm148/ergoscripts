The use-cases for physical->blockchain NFT right now all seem kind of...gimmicky. I envisioned that stuff like property deeds could be tokenized (and maybe signed by a third party?) and they'd act as a sort of contract for physical objects - or am I misunderstanding?


[02/08/2021 10:19 PM] crandano#8951
in time yes - we're just witnessing the start of NFT's


[02/08/2021 10:24 PM] glasgowm#9381
oh ok class üôÇ  - Is there anything stopping people from just using it like ebay/craigslist now?


[02/09/2021 12:09 AM] crandano#8951
not necessarily but when it comes down to it i'd think you'd need decentralized identification layer to prove who you are and potentially a rating like ebay/amazon where people know you're a legitimate seller since there's no structure to protect people from buying something then the sender doesn't follow through - if that makes sense

[02/09/2021 12:10 AM] crandano#8951
that's my same thinking around using NFT's for property etc right now is in current form it's hard because there's nothing enforcing the legitimacy of something - but seems that stuff is being worked on!


[02/09/2021 8:04 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yeh, its not the easiest one to solve either. But I figure it'll maybe get some use out of good-faith and memes alone


[02/09/2021 8:07 AM] glasgowm#9381
Hmm actually - could you not handle the payment side via an autonomous escrow-type thing?


[02/09/2021 8:07 AM] glasgowm#9381
You're kinda screwed for the address tho - until the blockchain figures out how to lick stamps


[02/12/2021 9:23 PM] RedOctober#4331
Hi,my bid transaction gets rejected 24 hours ago and i still waiting for returns funds, is it normal? or ,what should i do?

Hey! No, it's not normal. Please DM me the address you send ergs to.


[02/13/2021 7:43 AM] glasgowm#9381
My funds are returned almost instantly when I try and submit an auction


[02/13/2021 7:44 AM] glasgowm#9381
no obvious error that I can see

[02/13/2021 11:00 AM] glasgowm#9381
Would be good to store auction details somewhere (in the browser session?) - easy to misclick before sending funds. 

The character limit is also a bit restrictive, but I'm not sure if this is a hard limit set by the space on the NFT?


[02/13/2021 11:03 AM] glasgowm#9381
Also any suggestions on how I could 'sign' artwork? I've just used first 3 and last 3 chars of my wallet address. Was thinking I could maybe mint a GPG key or QR code of a GPG key? Not sure if there's anything more inherent to erg I could do


[02/13/2021 11:11 AM] anon_real#2768
The description character limit?


[02/13/2021 11:12 AM] anon_real#2768
Signing Artwork is not part of the Artwork NFT standard. But you can use any approach you like with the artwork itself (like what you have already done)


[02/13/2021 11:12 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah it's set to 150 chars

[02/13/2021 11:12 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yeh I was just looking for ideas of something maybe a bit more inherent than a GPG key


[02/13/2021 11:13 AM] anon_real#2768
It can be increased. Would 250 be good enough?


[02/13/2021 11:13 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yep that would be helpful for my uses anyway üôÇ


[02/13/2021 11:14 AM] anon_real#2768

[02/16/2021 7:26 PM] TwinkleToes#6964
Hi there, Guys. Laymen's questions. I wanting to produce artwork for the artwork competition. I'm hoping for clarity on whether or not one can have more than one artwork in a single bid, like a collections 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3, within one bid? Also, if one can enter multiple artworks into a single category? Lastly, if one can enter an artwork into each category?


[02/16/2021 7:26 PM] TwinkleToes#6964
a collection*


[02/17/2021 8:13 AM] TwinkleToes#6964
Any one have an answer?


[02/17/2021 8:21 AM] anon_real#2768
@TwinkleToes  I don't know the rules precisely so maybe @mx can clarify on rules.
But it doesn't make sense to have multiple artworks in one auction. You have to create an auction for each one of them separately.


[02/17/2021 8:34 AM] mx#5165
if you have many ideas you can compete in all categories sure, also put as many auctions as you like in each, otherwise it would need to look like this https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/specific/c5a94beb46c650fea59f82c3c156bd8be26939491506c22b065cb94e78b422c0

You can use Any Wallet which also supports Yoroi currently.
Direct Yoroi support (dapp bridge) depends on when the connector is finished for Yoroi.

[02/25/2021 10:26 PM] jeffz#2600
I couldn't get it to work the other way as it was taking too long for transactions to clear (sending the NFT from yoroi and sending an amount of ERG for the auction in 2 transactions)


[02/25/2021 10:26 PM] jeffz#2600
so I had to duplicate my NFT


[02/25/2021 10:26 PM] jeffz#2600
I don't know if I can burn the original, but otherwise it will just stay dormant, never to be sent.


[02/25/2021 10:27 PM] arastaragon#8048
thanks for the quick reply. I watched the vid. But I have already the artwork online and would like to a) delete the artwork/send it back or b) use this one and start an auction. Would be a pity to lose the erg üòÑ

Hi Community!  I have received many requests for improving the UI/UX for Auction House. I have already addressed some of them but have been extremely busy with other stuff so couldn‚Äôt address some of them until now.  Since currently all of the auctions are Artwork auctions, I have updated the site to better fulfill the needs of artists.  First, ...

I'm looking at an auction and it says "8666 Remaining"... I just know this is going to be a dumb question, but 8666 what?


[03/03/2021 9:09 PM] anon_real#2768
blocks. each block is 2 minutes.


[03/03/2021 9:10 PM] bitsolver#7337
great thx... next dumb question üòõ if I win the token... then what? I'll be in my Yoroi wallet, and... what exactly? if you couldn't tell, this is my first foray into NFTs üòÑ


[03/03/2021 9:11 PM] bitsolver#7337
obviously there's artwork attached to the token... and I can see it in the auction listing... but how would I see it after I won it?


[03/03/2021 9:11 PM] bitsolver#7337
does Yoroi know how to display it?


[03/03/2021 9:13 PM] bitsolver#7337
...also, I can see the checksum in the listing... would I also be able to see that (and whatever other data there is related to the token) after winning it?


[03/03/2021 9:16 PM] anon_real#2768
@bitsolver Yoroi will show the name of the NFT only. However other data is always present on the blockchain and everyone can verify that you have the right NFT.


[03/03/2021 9:19 PM] bitsolver#7337
interesting... so the image that goes with it... would I have to download that off the auction page in order to have the file? I'd eventually like to have it printed and hang it up üñºÔ∏è


[03/03/2021 9:20 PM] bitsolver#7337
(again, assuming it win it)


[03/03/2021 9:21 PM] bitsolver#7337
oh... just realized there's a webpage for it listed on the auction page... so presumably I could DL it from there as well... can't rely on it always being available forever tho...

Thanks. What if someone mints an NFT, but doesn't auction it, is there still a way to see it? or showcase it?


[03/03/2021 10:47 PM] anon_real#2768
As long as the NFT issuance is following the right standard (EIP-4) then any app that works with NFTs should be able to process and show them.


[03/03/2021 10:58 PM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
Would it be interesting to also have a category "Non auctioned NFTs" besides "Active Auctions" and "Auction History" in Auction House?


[03/03/2021 11:00 PM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
Maybe there's a category of artists that don't wish to put on auction right away some of their art, but still make their work known.We assume that artists need to sell everything they produce right away, but it's maybe not the case.

btw, yoroi stores ergo but will it store the NFTs?


[03/04/2021 5:34 AM] Mfer Ikerio#8567
like how Metamask can store them in the Collectibles window


[03/04/2021 5:42 AM] Zimulakra#7908
Yes, Yoroi can store NFTs and if you go to the send window you can choose which NFT you want to send


[03/04/2021 5:43 AM] Mfer Ikerio#8567
nice! never used yoroi because I like to feel like a 1337 h4x0r using daedalus or the ergo node but does it also preview the nfts?


[03/04/2021 8:34 AM] glasgowm#9381
Nope, just the name

@anon_real Suggestion for the Auction House: 1) show the remaining time beside the remaining blocks 2) get Notifications for events happening on artworks we are interested in


[03/04/2021 4:24 PM] Mfer Ikerio#8567
that's a shame, hopefully they'll be able to do it so in the future. Storing the NFT itself is nice, but being able to see the artwork in real time is way more rewarding


[03/05/2021 12:41 AM] Zimulakra#7908
Has anybody sent an NFT from Yoroi to the auction house for either a primary or secondary sale?


[03/05/2021 6:01 AM] anon_real#2768
There is some issue for that. Let me fix it today and let you know.


[03/05/2021 6:02 AM] anon_real#2768

Perfect! Thanks !


[03/05/2021 3:15 PM] anon_real#2768
@Zimulakra @UpwindStrategy - King de Medici your points have been addressed.
So to auction tokens using yoroi, you have to first send the token and then the necessary amount of ERGs for your initial bid.
It is because Yoroi does not support sending custom amount of ERG alongside tokens.


[03/05/2021 3:30 PM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
Really nice! Could I suggest to show in this format? 17 days 3 hours 7 minutes


[03/05/2021 3:31 PM] anon_real#2768
Yeah, I thought about that but didn't have time to do it ))
So next time hopefully


[03/05/2021 4:18 PM] Mfer Ikerio#8567
yeah, the block size format is the reason why I accidentally made a 1 year auction


[03/05/2021 4:18 PM] Mfer Ikerio#8567

Question from Telegrm NFT channel: Hey, Is anyone having difficulty creating a new auction? I am doing the steps as usual but when i hit create auction on the ergoauction house site it gives me this (Send exactly 0.092 erg and the token you want to auction to .........) to input into ergo utils which is below the min required for the transaction. Has something changed that I missed?

im having the same issue, i just tried to up the entry bid and send one thru but it seems like the nft didn't make it to the auction house


[03/06/2021 4:42 AM] vcitbh44#0837
the transaction was sent from my wallet but ergoutils says its still creating and nothing happening on the auction house side


[03/06/2021 4:50 AM] vcitbh44#0837
the funds were just returned. strange tho it doesn't list the correct amount for the transaction to take place when trying to send an nft.  i've already sent before too never had this issue


[03/06/2021 7:08 AM] anon_real#2768
It should be fixed now. Please refresh ErgoUtils for changes to take effect and issue your NFT again.

With NFTs the big security question is: How do I know that this is the real thing and not a counterfeit which looks just like the real one? People seem to be simply ignoring the problem now, but if they're still a thing years from now it will be a huge issue.

and it sold like pancakes


[03/08/2021 7:06 PM] Mfer Ikerio#8567
the thing is, if your work stands out, it's because it's new and original


[03/08/2021 7:06 PM] Mfer Ikerio#8567
also, you can always prove against other NFTs trying to steal your work by comparing the genesis block


[03/08/2021 7:06 PM] Mfer Ikerio#8567
so the lesson is: never upload your art until it's made an NFT lol

[03/11/2021 8:03 AM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
@anon_real Good morning üôÇ I would have a suggestion idea for the auction house: and it would to add a Reserve Price, which would not force the artist to sell under the reserve price and at the same time, there isn't any fees calculated on the reserve price. For the moment an artist that want to sell for a minimum price has to bid himself on the artwork and pay a 2% fee on this "reserve price". Our auction house would be a lot more attractive to good artists with this feature.

Is it possible for NFTs to have royalties? Meaning, if the NFT is re-sold, the original seller gets some % of the new sale?


[03/12/2021 6:27 AM] anon_real#2768
Since tokens are separate entities from contracts, I don't think so. @kushti is it possible somehow on Ergo?


[03/12/2021 11:19 AM] oroalej#3957
wow. there's an auction with 10k ERG bid.


[03/12/2021 5:36 PM] kushti#0978
It is possible to bound token to some contract, but then composability for such contract becomes a hard topic


[03/13/2021 1:24 AM] vcitbh44#0837
is anyone having problems starting a new auction? I just tried and its giving the wrong amount of erg to be sent to the auction.  Tried to start with 0.1 and its telling me to send 0.092 to the auction house

I've sent multiple NFTs before but now i'm getting this error.  I watched the video to see if i missed something but i've done it step by step and this is what i see.  I've put in 0.1 for the starting bid but i'm being told to send 0.092 which is below the bid.  In the past it's been 0.102 to the auction house than 0.104 to the utils to send the NFT.  Not sure whats going on

[03/13/2021 4:56 PM] anon_real#2768
Don't worry about it. Just follow the instructions!
If you are using ergoutils to issue new NFT, then it takes into account the extra 0.01 ERG. If you want to auction some NFT that you have in your Yoroi, then just send the token and 0.092 ERG to the address.


[03/13/2021 4:56 PM] anon_real#2768
Nothing is wrong.


[03/13/2021 5:19 PM] Velvia#6830
Do I send the ERG and token as separate transactions? I can't see in Yoroi how to send ERG + token at the same time?


[03/13/2021 5:41 PM] anon_real#2768
Yes, unfortunately yoroi doesn't support sending custom amount of ERG with token. So send token first and then in a separate transaction, the ERG amount that is asked for.

Hi guys and @anon_real , here is my latest NFT üôÇ It is a double NFT: the first one contains a unique hash embedded linking to  another one, because the auction house doesn't present videos with sound yet. The result is really cool. https://twitter.com/veriumfellow/status/1370959359241502723?s=20

This animated audio NFT, called "Elevation, Level 1/12 in G-flat minor" is the first of a #collection of 12, with every following NFT being an exact transposition to the next scale degree. Are you going to own all 12?

A few suggestions for UI.
- For auctions in progress, to have one button/link to retrieve all live bids related to your wallet
- For history auctions, one button/link to retrieve all auctions won by your wallet


[03/14/2021 3:08 PM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
Other suggestions: -For auctions, be able to showcase publicly a link to a lower resolution file and send with the winning bid automatically in secret the link to the full format file. I saw that Christies don't give you the full file, they split it in different high res files for example. So ideally, the HASH would be calculated with the final file and this one would be stored in the blockchain. For the moment we have to link to a file less than 32MB big, and GIF has no possibility for sound. Also, it seems risky without an intermediary such as Christies, to be sure that the artist will be reachable and send you the high resolution file once the bid is finished. If we had a way to reserve the full resolution file for the owner of the NFT, it would have more value for the buyer, more security for the seller against copy. There's probably a way to send an encrypted message that only the NFT owner can read? Support for video would be great too, as it seems that music only is less attractive.


[03/14/2021 5:13 PM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
Question from an artist to which I was talking about Ergo: is the auction house connected to OpenSea. Not sure it's possible. Just saw that "unlockable content" is an idea that is in fact already implemented on Rarible:

OpenSea is on Ethereum.  Different network.


[03/15/2021 9:08 AM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
Another suggestion: once you are at the bottom of the page, have an automatic loading of the next block of auctions instead of having to click on Load More, because if you don't see it you could think that there isn't many artworks in the auction house.


[03/15/2021 10:21 AM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
Another suggestion: If an artist could generate a link presenting all his artworks (using the issuing address in the URL for example), he could then use this link (or a shortened version of it) on social media platforms more easily to present all his artworks together in the twitter profile for example.

Maybe some of the artists/collectors want to get together and discuss the priority list on features to be upgraded. It might be more efficient to have a planned roadmap for the Auction House so that similar changes can be made together.

Also, I suppose you have set yoroi wallet's address - then you can view it in the send tab if you have won. Otherwise your bid amount must have been returned to you.

No, Yoroi doesn't show artwork, it just shows the token itself. You can find the finished auction in the "history" section of the auction house and view the artwork and save it.

What is the audio link?


[03/24/2021 2:55 PM] 20Log#8768
HI anon, so the link was drive.google link, i uploaded the .wav to my google drive, and created a sharable link which i set to restricted - only people added can open this link. <-- i assume i need to redo it but this time set the link to anyone can view it ? after that i just edited the link to work at a direct download which worked as i could preview it. I have now changed the restriction on that link so i will ask some of the ADA guys to try it now and see if that has fixed it before i try another


[03/24/2021 3:17 PM] anon_real#2768
Hey!
Direct download link from google drive should be like this:
`https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YourFileID`.
You can find your file's id from the link you create to share it and place it as`YourFileID`. 
So the final link will be sth like:
`https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B_ETxiqrp0SzbF9VQ3JCS2hnSlU`

The first time I tried to mint this, I didn't include a google drive link in the artwork description and I didn't tick the "Upload artwork" box


[03/24/2021 3:23 PM] Foeniculum#3278
as a result, the preview was grayed out
The second time, I included both a google drive link and ticked the box


[03/24/2021 3:23 PM] Foeniculum#3278
My question is: did I only have to do one to make the preview appear? Or do I need both?
I noticed that some artworks do not have a drive link in the description, hence my question


[03/24/2021 3:40 PM] 20Log#8768
Hi anon looks like the link i had created started the same as you're direct download link at the time i had used a YT video on how to edit it to make it a D-Download, which is ended up looking like this "drive.google.com/'uc?id=MyFileID&export=download'.

 (i removed the Https:// above so it wouldnt create a link in the chat here, but the actual link i used had it)

Shall i try again but in the order you have suggested, was the way i did it still fine and its something else maybe?


[03/24/2021 3:48 PM] anon_real#2768
Can you please send me the link?


[03/24/2021 3:50 PM] anon_real#2768
Fro audio, you have to provide a direct link to the audio. For picture, like yours, you just have to click the "Upload artwork" checkbox and ergoutils will automatically upload your artwork to imgbb.com

As I am looking more into NFT's these days, I have come across this: 
https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122
It seems one of the main concerns about NFT's is storing the actual media and another concern would be: Can the seller modify, at a later time, the link pointing to the media? 
Reading that whole thread, a few suggestions point to storing the media on file-storage chains, like FILE Coin/ network, so I am now wondering if it would be possible to list and NFT on Ergo but link it to FILE, so the media is stored on FILE. 
Also, it seems to me that a network providing NFT's who at the same time provides decentralised ( or maybe even centralised, but quaranteed fo a number of years) storage could be a lot more interesting to the average Joe. I'm thinking of a website that would act as a "storage wharehouse" with a "Public Galery" function incorporated. Something like, the owner of the NFT could store, but also could choose to pubicly display the media that the NFT is linked to. 

What are your thoughts on this?

Feedback from the Perspective of a Musician (wasn't sure where best to post this)

1. It would be a mass improvement to have Audio Nfts be represented alongside some artwork. (People eat with there eyes and all that jazz)

2. I had a photographer friend who wants to animate his photographs and then wanted me to layer audio on top presumably creating some form of .mp4-esq ? filetype (not sure as this is not my forte). But if it was i gather these are currently not supported as i couldnt find this information anywhere?

3. The ability to link other auctions you have together so people can easily find other NFTs you have on offer (Atm this isn't really a problem in the audio section) - possibly a way to give more info about yourself as a artist, links to socials etc ?

4. Would it be possible to see the introduction of a royalties type feature similar to how rariable offer this as well as the minting of a collection ?

Apologies if any of this has been covered before, just wanted to give some feed back about what i think could improve the A.H from a musicians perspective

yes, on the left there is a tab called auction history. Here is the link to my first one: https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/specific/d1c50fcc27585b3affb2dbb0e503a530f41c7fdc7a1fdaaf0b3dc8e0d74a876b

Sorry if i am mistaken, but you are using Audio to generate the images ? if so would you be willing to make one for me using some songs i have composed and produced ?


[03/27/2021 11:30 AM] UtahRaptor#3855
Audio is used to influence it. It is not 100% dependant on the music, but the music has an effect. Sure, send me a PM with your song and I'll see what we can do.

I'll be bidding on this for sure! I won my first auction and now I'm trying to learn what that actually means. I got to the point of being able to find the asset listing in the transaction explorer, but what about the media itself? is there a structured way to transfer the files for is it simply reaching out to the seller and finding a way to get ahold of the original file?


[03/27/2021 4:46 PM] Foeniculum#3278
Glad you like it üòÑ I send a GNOMECOIN to every bidder, so even if you don't win the auction you can still enjoy that lucky charm üòã  I minted 777 of them, there are 769 available.

Mmh I've never won an auction yet actually, but I remember reading about the possibility of accessing the media on the Ergo platform. I'm sure @anon_real can help you better with that üòÑ

[03/27/2021 4:49 PM] Dergler#0451
well, I've been bidding on a lot of your works then, like the stuff, happy to support.


[03/27/2021 4:49 PM] Dergler#0451
it's nice to play around with this stuff without ya know, endless amounts of gwei wasted.


[03/27/2021 4:51 PM] Foeniculum#3278
Ooh thank you so much! I can't mine ERG and I've already invested a considerable amount in it, so minting NFTs is really my only way to keep accumulating for now haha

My main works are way more elaborated than what I've minted so far, I'm just trying to dip my waters in this NFT world before going all in on that üôÇ


[03/27/2021 4:52 PM] Foeniculum#3278
and yeah I chose ERG auction house not only to support and promote Ergo but also because fuck gas fees, I love minting stuff for just 0.112 ERG


[03/27/2021 4:54 PM] Dergler#0451
understandable! Like I said, this is my second asset after ADA and it's great to have something small enough (for now!) that I can try things, break things, play around all without $1000's. When it come to supporting artwork NFTs, it takes creation and consumption! I'll promote your works for sure. helps both of us.


[03/27/2021 4:59 PM] Foeniculum#3278
You're every artits' angel üòÜ really appreciate that!
I discovered ERG thanks to ADA, which is my biggest holding (discovered ADA in May 2020, ERG only a few weeks ago). Really eager to see how the both will evolve in the future, with or without the boost of a bullrun üöÄ


[03/27/2021 5:03 PM] Dergler#0451
We'll have to learn about the media side of things together then! like what is/what should be the process to prove ownership and then transferring the art. i honestly have just a clue on how that should work. overall, I look at ergo as a playground to learn things here and transfer that knowledge over to ADA once it gains all these capabilities come August.


[03/27/2021 5:23 PM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111

Zero Knowledge Treasury


[03/27/2021 6:24 PM] Dergler#0451
but it's looking like it isn't quite rolled out yet? if it's truly possible to do this: Ergo‚Äôs Zero-Knowledge Treasury enables users to easily create joint digital signatures, with bespoke conditions for spending funds, while ensuring the signatories to the created address remain hidden' then we can make an escrow.


[03/27/2021 6:25 PM] Dergler#0451

Dear Ergo Community,  In this post, I would like to explain a project on top of Ergo‚Äôs Distributed Signatures capability. This idea has arisen from the discussion here on the forum by Kushti.  It was cool to see a working example of distributed signatures But the process to sign such transactions collectively is somehow complex for non-technical...

arweave
arweave is a global, permanent hard drive built on two novel technologies: the blockweave, a derivative of the blockchain, and proof of access, a custom incentivised proof of work algorithm. These innovations provide truly permanent data storage for the very first time and at a massive scale.

[03/28/2021 8:15 PM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
It'll be interesting to see if businesses pop up powered by arweave/ipfs, to automate and standardize NFT minting... 
standards need to be set for the whole industry... 
The parallel to the early days of the internet is kind of trippy

Has anyone seen any kind of standards somewhere? for getting nfts to show up in wallets nicely???


[03/28/2021 8:26 PM] Dergler#0451
nope. my goals right now are to simply explore the media handling side of it all and I think arweave/IPFS as shown by spacebudz is a decent way to do it. as an art NFT holder I would have to have to host a digital file myself in a place that might get destroyed. like what if it's on my pc and my house burns down!


[03/28/2021 8:26 PM] Dergler#0451
is imbb something comparable to ipfs?


[03/28/2021 8:26 PM] Dergler#0451
could it be used alongside arweave?


[03/28/2021 8:27 PM] Dergler#0451
gross imgbb has terms of service and curators that check content.


[03/28/2021 8:39 PM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
The difference is trust in the host of the NFT. 

I assume the ERGO dev team is currently funding the imbb account that hosts the NFTs on ErgoAuctions...

But it's not just if the ERGO dev team can't afford to keep that account open, but also if imbb even stays in business for as long as an ERGO nft exists.

ARWeave promises to keep the files forever once you pay to host them.. as long as ARWeave stays profitable to mine for people


[03/29/2021 12:07 AM] Dergler#0451
But couldn‚Äôt the original file simply be moved to another host if needed? Could even put it in multiple places.?


[03/29/2021 12:26 AM] Dergler#0451
okay I think I got it sorted. it wasn't clear to a new buyer on the auction house what happens after winning a bid which threw me for a loop!~ I took me looking all around the universe to finally think, maybe the image hosted on imgbb is that actual file. so then I had to sort out how to check the checksum and that was also quite a loop ahaha.


[03/29/2021 4:58 AM] Dergler#0451
Okay @Foeniculum I put some thought into adding authenticity that you are the original creator. I saw the Nob written signatures, but what about putting your cryptographic signature into the pieces, when when it gets hashed into the NFT during the minting process the you prove that you had the right to mint it as the creator. help me think through this

{Reactions}
ü§î 

[03/29/2021 4:59 AM] Dergler#0451
essentially an artist's written signature in the analog world equates to a signature from your key in the digital world.


[03/29/2021 6:32 AM] Foeniculum#3278
That's sounds great! Would IPFS help with this?


[03/29/2021 6:33 AM] Dergler#0451
no i don't think so, it would take you incorporating it into your process some how. wish I could be more helpfule right now but i can't keep my eyes open.


[03/29/2021 6:35 AM] Dergler#0451
like, I know a file's check sum will change when you change the file just a touch, and if that touch was a visible example of your digital signature then it would prove that YOU minted the token that goes with the media. i might be wrong though.


[03/29/2021 6:35 AM] Dergler#0451
see ya tomorrow, im gonna sleep on my bid.

That's actually a good point haha


[03/29/2021 5:49 PM] Foeniculum#3278
So basically, the Ergo telegram group suggested to:


[03/29/2021 5:49 PM] Foeniculum#3278
a) set up a website
b) create a smart contract to manage resale cuts on ERGnomes based on their rarity


[03/29/2021 5:50 PM] Foeniculum#3278
we also need to
c) implement IFPS to improve the authenticity of the NFT


[03/29/2021 5:56 PM] Dergler#0451
on the authenticity bit, check out what cardanowall.com is doing. looks like they are using an additional key pair (SHA3-256) and putting the public key in the metadata to declare ownership. then the original artist holds the original private key that posted it. you could do that during the minting process in theory.

Is this intended to allow any NFT to be signed by an artist?... So any NFT could exist, with art they didn't actually make, but valuable NFTs would have this kind of signature?

How do we apply the sign to the NFT then without it becoming public?

[03/29/2021 7:35 PM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
Same... seems like there needs to be a way put something in an NFT that only the owner can see... Is that an option?


[03/29/2021 7:37 PM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
THEN you'd need some kind of cntralized location for an artist to send people if they're wanting to validate someone's NFT is legit; they connect their wallet and it securely validates and shows the last known owner's address publicly?.... This seems like a lot for an artist and art collector to take on üòõ


[03/29/2021 7:38 PM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
Seems like a business model in itself


[03/29/2021 7:39 PM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
with ARWeave for the image repo and securing the signature with some other means, then hosting a validator... 

Feels like this functionality might be built altogether somewhere


[03/29/2021 7:44 PM] Dergler#0451
I haven‚Äôt found how it‚Äôs done yet


[03/29/2021 7:46 PM] Dergler#0451
But if an artist puts their public key on their Twitter and in the NFT metadata then the link to a reputation source is completed. That‚Äôs why hoskinson puts his there

the buyer only gets whatever was posted into register9 of the minting process. the trick is to find a good way to link the media to the token.

wdym its not a hosted site? The UI is hosted but traffic on the UI wouldn't be an issue. Payments should be just like normal transactions so should be fine too? I think AgeUSD is a specific case where there is issues because it's a bit more involved/underdeveloped


[04/07/2021 10:52 AM] LADOPIXŒ£L#6072
Thanks!


[04/07/2021 4:09 PM] Dergler#0451
I‚Äôm probably using technical terms wrong here since I‚Äôm new to this knowledge domain. But isn‚Äôt the site a static site? Meaning all the scripts run in The users browser? I was calling that ‚Äònot hosted‚Äô since the user wouldn‚Äôt be interacting with a web server like they would on a older Wordpress style site.


[04/07/2021 4:18 PM] glasgowm#9381
Umm...kinda? It uses React, which lots of other sites do (fb, uber, etc). The difference is nothing is stored on the server and instead it interacts with the blockchain using the assembler/node to do stuff like generate a bid transaction server-side.


[04/07/2021 4:21 PM] Dergler#0451
Yea! So the site is super fast. If anything would be stress tested it would be the various APIs- imbb, assembler, Yoroi. Is that right? This is all fascinating to learn about


[04/07/2021 4:23 PM] glasgowm#9381
I would think so yeh, that should all be (generally) be fine too but I'm just guessing. Weak point would possibly be the dApp connector since it's untested yet and idk how it works

[04/14/2021 5:35 AM] Dergler#0451
I like that, are you linking the NFT to the physical with this one?


[04/14/2021 5:42 AM] Teek#1377
I think they are posting the physical link in it.  (My friend made this NFT/is the artist)
Not sure if there's a better way to also market their physical prints/canvas paintings, it was their first NFT and first time using any sort of crypto.

Big fan of their stuff I've gotten in person.


[04/14/2021 5:58 AM] Dergler#0451
I'm really interested in the process of turning physical art into NFTs. one thing that puzzles me, is how to confirm the current owner had the rights to tokenize it at the time.


[04/14/2021 5:59 AM] Dergler#0451
people are trying tons of different ways, but I don't know what will end up being the best way, esp. without having digital ID yet.


[04/14/2021 6:12 AM] Teek#1377
Could you not just post a public key on your website, and on each NFT just place a signed message in the art?
(completely new to NFT's on ergo/ergo still)


[04/14/2021 6:18 AM] Dergler#0451

I wish the description was in a <pre> tag instead of a <p> tag so the linebreaks would be kept.


[04/20/2021 8:42 PM] JamesKelley#2466
Here's what it would look like with a <pre> tag instead:

Without the <pre> tag it gets jumbled up a bit.

Hmm. I just noticed that if I use a <pre> tag (by editing the DOM) I lose the last sentence, so maybe a straight swap of tags isn't a good idea.

There are people who are not using the auction house because they're on Yoroi, and when they click on "Connect your wallet" -> ["Yoroi Wallet" tab] they get a message saying it will be available in the future, and then they just leave the auction house cause they cba setting up a full node

It's not clear that they can just past their Yoroi wallet address on the first popup they see after clicking on "Connect your wallet", they assume (rightfully so) that they should click on "Yoroi wallet"

This could really hinder adoption, especially as more newbies start playing around with Ergo dApps; it would be great if the "Yoroi Wallet" tab could be removed, since it's a bit redundant/misleading? üôÇ

To address an issue raised by @kushti:  ‚ÄúI think with strict deadline there‚Äôs a good strategy to get a better price: wait until few blocks before the end of an auction and then submit a slightly better price.

The GIFs on the picture page seem to load quite slowly; when landing on the page the first animation cycle plays quickly and then they freeze up


[04/30/2021 8:34 AM] Platypus#2410
is it the amount of data the page needs to download?


[04/30/2021 3:13 PM] Dergler#0451
Yea. The images are being loaded full size/full res without much optimization.


[04/30/2021 4:25 PM] Platypus#2410
ah ok, i know the devs have got their hands filled with all the work, but it definitely impairs the experience browsing the auctionhouse and wouldn't be very welcoming to newcomers


[04/30/2021 4:25 PM] Platypus#2410
easy to shout from the sidelines though


[04/30/2021 5:33 PM] Dergler#0451
yea it is easy to shout from the sidelines! yes there could be some improvements for usability, but that would require a image hosting server to be setup which optimizes them between the source on imbb and the auction house. as it stands right now it's a very simple but reliable site, just slow.

Can someone explain the reasoning behind buying an NFT. Is there anything besides supporting the artist. If it is on giphy what's to stop someone from just downloading it


[05/07/2021 11:12 PM] MikeyMike87#9350
I have gotten my artist friend on board. Has wanted to get into the NFT world but didn't know how and the high fees of other sites had scared him off. I gave him the full rundown on the ERGO auction house and will be fronting the launching costs for his first auctions for him. Will be posting this weekend and will plaster them everywhere

Putting art work on Giphy makes the art available for people to see and there's definitely some question of if exposure is better or worse for the art or artist... depending on x, y, z... 
but supporting the artist/developer is at the core of the exchange. 

Owning art in general is a strange concept some would argue because of the ability to capture media in the modern age... 

However, In my opinion supporting artists, depending on the artists and how they treat their art (as an expression or as an asset or as both), can definitely be financially beneficial for both Artist and Patron regardless of if the art is widely available for viewing...

Depends on the artist, depends on the collector, depends on the medium (3d, 2d, animated, painted, printed, etc... )... but I think we're just starting to scratch the surface üòÑ DIG IN!


[05/07/2021 11:29 PM] MikeyMike87#9350
Oh for sure. I've been a huge supporter of his from the beginning. I've got 6 of his paintings. A funky fresh style and he's just a young guy scraping by so anything I can do to help him grow and get out there I will do

Auction duration assumes 720 blocks/day. However, network hashrate has been consistently increasing possibly because of price rise. So faster blocks means the auctions durations will pass faster also.

Hi, do you think this is something yoroi will implement?
Would be pretty cool!


[05/27/2021 12:59 PM] anon_real#2768
I doubt it. @c8e4d2a has some tool for that already I think.


[05/27/2021 1:02 PM] V__C#6587
Thanks, still learning. 
I can see the transaction for the NFT i won, just figuring the best way for storing it.


[05/27/2021 1:04 PM] V__C#6587
And then also possibilities for reselling back on auction.

There's a Ergo NFT gallery actually!

How To Issue an Artwork NFT Auction - Ergo Blockchain
In this video we take you step-by-step through how to create an Artwork NFT using https://ergoutils.org and then auctioning it off on the Ergo Auction House https://ergoauctions.org/.

[05/27/2021 2:04 PM] Foeniculum#3278
Since the NFT you're reselling has already been minted, you can skip the bit on ErgoUtils and just send ERG + token to the smart contract address that appears when you set up the auction.


[05/27/2021 2:04 PM] Foeniculum#3278
You can do so in two transactions üôÇ it doesn't matter whether you send the ERG or the NFT first to that address.

Luckily, a member of the #Ergo community who won Nautilus said they'd return it so it can be auctioned fairly once tx issues are fixedüòÑ

No, sorry for calling out a problem. It was caused on my side. I had a VPN turned on without noticing it and it seems that it somehow blocked ibb.co

Just a heads up: if the auction artwork is a gray image reading "not found", it means the author didn't tick the "upload artwork" box when minting the NFT :)

you can do so in two separate transactions; it doesn't matter which one you send first, as long as you send both of them to the same address that pops up when you set up the auction üëèüèº

Aah that happens when the transaction didn't go through before the end of the auction, which makes it risky to "snipe" with last minute bids

pro tip: the auto extend feature makes the auction last 30 min longer if the bid is placed within the last 30 min

if you don't want to trigger it, you'll have to bid when the remaining time is >30 min ü§´

Cheers dude, was hoping hes on here as i dont use twitter. But with the ERG listings and the explosion on SOL and POLYpunks over the last week. I wanted to tempt him into doing a similar thing for ERG if he and others could collab and make 10,000 listing with random generated parts etc etc. Think the concept is cool and would be nice to have something similar on ERG which we also could use as our DP's etc

@Foeniculum Can you send a transaction of an NFT + some amount of ERG through yoroi? I am trying to start an auction. How do you typically do it?


[08/03/2021 11:03 PM] Snax#3268
Or do I need to run a full node and construct a JSON request to do it


[08/03/2021 11:03 PM] Snax#3268
Also, how do you typically issue tokens?


[08/03/2021 11:05 PM] Snax#3268
or do you just use https://ergoutils.org to do both at the same time


[08/03/2021 11:29 PM] Foeniculum#3278
If you already own a NFT and don't need to mint it, you can set up an auction on Ergo Auction House and send ERG & the NFT you want to auction in two separate transactions!


[08/03/2021 11:29 PM] Foeniculum#3278
Doesn't matter which one you send first


[08/03/2021 11:30 PM] Foeniculum#3278
If I want to mint a NFT and sell it instantly, I first set up the auction and then mint the NFT on ErgoUtils (to do this you need to click on "advanced configuration" on ErgoUtils and paste the ERG & address that pops  up on Ergo Auction House when you set up the auction)


[08/03/2021 11:30 PM] Foeniculum#3278
So I keep 2 tabs open to be safe!

I had to re-send one after a few minutes, because it looks like when I first sent both transactions, yoroi tried to double-spend a box and one got cancelled.

Yo dude - so as you can see my pfp i took part yesterday in Solanas Monkeybusiness Nft. It seems there is a geniune love for these pixelated buggers. As also seen my Crypto punks on eth, Solpunks on Sol, and Polypunks on Matic (though that hasnt gone well for numerous reasons). 

I was suggesting you did something similar for your style where you release X amount that get minted and minters receive a random one upon minting


[08/04/2021 4:00 PM] 20Log#8768
having X amount of attributes which are rare etc etc. Dont have to copy it but maybe swing your own style on that formula


[08/04/2021 4:02 PM] 20Log#8768
i also like your portrait view of the pixel characters, over the punks that are at a angle - IMO

How does this process work? If I win, what do I get?


[08/05/2021 11:55 AM] Mr.Pixel#2557
If you win the auction, u will get an NFT. üôÇ


[08/05/2021 11:58 AM] Tovarisch NFTs#5861
And if you lose, you get your money back instantly.


[08/05/2021 11:58 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Yeah, but. Where is it stored? Or is the file just mailed to the winner


[08/05/2021 11:58 AM] Tovarisch NFTs#5861
In your Yoroi wallet


[08/05/2021 11:59 AM] HelixEvo#2120
It‚Äôs actually stored on the chain?


[08/05/2021 11:59 AM] Tovarisch NFTs#5861
Yes. Forever.

Welcome! You can also view the NFTs you own by pasting your address on https://ergonfts.org/ !


[08/05/2021 12:01 PM] Foeniculum#3278
It's the official Ergo NFT gallery ü•≥


[08/05/2021 12:02 PM] HelixEvo#2120
This is interesting. So instead of transactions on the chain, it‚Äôs also storing anything that fits inside a block?


[08/05/2021 12:03 PM] Foeniculum#3278
I guess? When you mint an NFT the "minting speed" depends on block times


[08/05/2021 12:03 PM] Foeniculum#3278
But I'm not too familiar with the technicalities sorry!


[08/05/2021 12:04 PM] HelixEvo#2120
I‚Äôm just checking the wallet is not just a pointer to a file store for the NFTs. So that if that file store went, you technically just then own a pointer to nothing


[08/05/2021 12:04 PM] Sveinbj–ærn#9502
No. In external storage like imgbb.com/ipfs.io


[08/05/2021 12:05 PM] Sveinbj–ærn#9502
for ergo NFTs - imgbb.com

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[08/05/2021 12:06 PM] HelixEvo#2120
So if imgbb.com went. Your NFTs are gone


[08/05/2021 12:06 PM] Sveinbj–ærn#9502
Actual URL you can see by right mouse click on NFT image in auction house.


[08/05/2021 12:07 PM] Sveinbj–ærn#9502
Yes!


[08/05/2021 12:07 PM] Foeniculum#3278
When you mint them, you can add their IPFS link to the NFT to add an extra layer of security


[08/05/2021 12:07 PM] Foeniculum#3278
And there's other stuff like Arweave that make sure that your NFTs will outlive you lol


[08/05/2021 12:08 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Interesting. Don‚Äôt see the draw myself, but seems to be a market for it.


[08/05/2021 12:09 PM] Sveinbj–ærn#9502
In ethereum there is some NFT projects which stores ALL NFT data in blockchain.


[08/05/2021 12:10 PM] HelixEvo#2120
That‚Äôs the hammer


[08/05/2021 12:10 PM] Sveinbj–ærn#9502
Autoglyph, CriptoKitties, etc


[08/05/2021 12:10 PM] HelixEvo#2120

[08/05/2021 6:40 PM] Teek#1377
saw some poor soul trying to get 5-10 NFT's have their transaction time out and lost about a full eth..


[08/05/2021 6:40 PM] Teek#1377
absolutely insane


[08/05/2021 6:45 PM] Teek#1377
will there ever be a marketplace for NFT's? 
I don't really like the whole bidding war thing that people have to go through to get something. I'd almost rather be charged a little extra than have to babysit auctions to make sure I can get something I have my eyes on


[08/05/2021 6:48 PM] Foeniculum#3278
Excuse me???


[08/05/2021 6:50 PM] Foeniculum#3278
Hopefully yeah!
And I feel you, that's probably why some people place much higher bids than the previous one.

See CHEPURBOY, he flew from 30ish to 55 ERG!

Yeah, i felt so bad. There were several large nft series drops on Eth+hardfork thing going on....it made gas jump 4x+ in a matter of minutes from what I was seeing


[08/05/2021 6:51 PM] Teek#1377
Yeah fair enough :p
Im not baller enough to get that CHEPURBOY, but if I was keen on getting it and had $$$$... I'd almost rather just be told "ok pay me 75ergo and lets get this over with. I have other things to do"


[08/05/2021 6:52 PM] Teek#1377
I guess overbidding is the "goto" move, but you just don't know if someone has large bags that will get to beat you. 
I kind of like the "aha I saw this NFT that is really cool and not enough people have seen. I'll get it now". It allows people with small discretionary budgets to actually get a really cool piece or two.


[08/05/2021 6:53 PM] Teek#1377
Of course I get the argument that higher bids=better for artist, so I'm pretty conflicted haha


[08/05/2021 6:53 PM] Foeniculum#3278
That's interesting you mention it, because when CHEPURBOY jumped to 55 ERG I thought of setting special "rewards" for higher bids


[08/05/2021 6:53 PM] Foeniculum#3278
e.g. unlock this extra if your bid is XX ERG, plus this if it is YY and so on


[08/05/2021 6:54 PM] Foeniculum#3278
been trying to make bidding more fun lately since the auction house is all we have atm üòÇ


[08/05/2021 6:55 PM] Teek#1377
Yeah true.
I'm really happy for you by the way. Seen you really take off in popularity, partially due to ergo getting more exposure but im sure a lot of it has to do with how much great content you pump out.

[08/06/2021 5:03 AM] CypherPet#3447
videos are not supported.. only gifs and images. it shouldn't be an issue for ergo, storing the hash and "link to the file" is simple.. but the auction house has no easy "upload video" button because, files are hosted on imgbb and they don't support mp4 or images larger than 32Mb.. I'm still not sure if imgbb is the best possible place to store files for nfts. Anonreal has done an awesome job building it but i'm skeptical about that imgbb hosting. lol I'd gladly mess around in the github repo to find how it could be implemented but i'm not good enough at programming to do this.

Hi! üëã I accidentally sent double payment to an ergoauctions address when bidding. I have won the auction, but the funds from the sencond transaction are still at the UTXO of the bidding contract. Is there anyone that has access and can help sent the funds back to me?


[08/09/2021 2:22 PM] where_cookie#3129
How do i upload to auction house?


[08/09/2021 2:22 PM] where_cookie#3129
when i try, it says send exact amount and nft


[08/09/2021 2:22 PM] where_cookie#3129
when i did that i got sent it back

:NE_PepeWhySad:


[08/09/2021 2:35 PM] Foeniculum#3278
You need to send them in 2 separate transactions!


[08/09/2021 2:35 PM] Foeniculum#3278
- Send ERG
- wait for confirmation
- Send NFT


[08/09/2021 2:35 PM] Foeniculum#3278
doesn't matter which one you send first really!


[08/09/2021 2:37 PM] where_cookie#3129
I tried that :NE_PepeWhySad:


[08/09/2021 2:37 PM] where_cookie#3129
or well


[08/09/2021 2:37 PM] where_cookie#3129
actually it went it as 1


[08/09/2021 2:37 PM] where_cookie#3129
how do i send nft alone to it from yuroi


[08/09/2021 2:37 PM] where_cookie#3129
it wont sent until i also send the erg


[08/09/2021 2:37 PM] Foeniculum#3278
Just like you'd send ERG!


[08/09/2021 2:37 PM] Foeniculum#3278
Click on "select asset" in the send page


[08/09/2021 2:38 PM] where_cookie#3129
I go to that, and it says no fees to send tho?


[08/09/2021 2:38 PM] Foeniculum#3278
You need to select the amount


[08/09/2021 2:38 PM] Foeniculum#3278
which is 1


[08/09/2021 2:38 PM] Foeniculum#3278
since you're sending 1 NFT


[08/09/2021 2:39 PM] where_cookie#3129
ya


[08/09/2021 2:40 PM] where_cookie#3129
i do that and it says +0 fees above the nft asset on the right :NE_pepe_notes:


[08/09/2021 2:40 PM] where_cookie#3129
im probably missing something


[08/09/2021 2:49 PM] where_cookie#3129
wait nvm, i see it


[08/09/2021 2:49 PM] where_cookie#3129
so i wait until thats been sent by my wallet


[08/09/2021 2:49 PM] where_cookie#3129
and then send the erg


[08/09/2021 2:50 PM] Foeniculum#3278
Yep! Just check the transactions page


[08/09/2021 2:50 PM] Foeniculum#3278
on Yoroi


[08/09/2021 2:51 PM] Foeniculum#3278
If it says "low", and when you click on it it says "1 confirmation" at the bottom, then you can send the ERG


[08/09/2021 2:51 PM] where_cookie#3129
thanks, always sent the erg before that came up


[08/09/2021 2:51 PM] where_cookie#3129

[08/09/2021 2:51 PM] where_cookie#3129

thought id get into nft space, new to it specifically


[08/09/2021 2:51 PM] Foeniculum#3278
I don't think it goes through if you send one right after the other, need to wait for the first transaction to go through!

@anon_real no I don‚Äôt mean outbid. I‚Äôm saying if a bid was processing at the same time I was placing. I know I wasn‚Äôt out bid as that amount wasn‚Äôt reach for another 40 minutes


[08/10/2021 6:34 PM] anon_real#2768
It is possible if the mempool was very busy so another bid got stuck there for the same auction.

Hey all! I've been thinking about minting a picture NFT that could be redeemed for a physical product. Does anyone have an idea of how the redemption process would work once I've minted the NFT?

Some Details About Ergo Auction House
In this thread, I am going to discuss a solution for having NFT Royalty functionality on Ergo.  Our goal is to pay the artist each time his artwork is auctioned and sold with some percentage of the amount.  To achieve that, we can enforce the box with the same ID as the NFT to be provided to the auction contract. Then the contract can make sure ...

If someone wants to support here is the first auction on the platform. There will be related to blockchain of events applied psychology and my belief that through understanding the blocks or sharing with external.validators can be repaired. I went through toxic psychosis years ago and through art and drawing I was able to overcome grief and losses in areas like love. I would like to use the amounts in order to try to develop blockchain as a tool or service to improve transaction speed and reduce costs on the mental health and also prision reintegration to society. Also as a way to educate masses and be rewarded in some sort of credits on the university of life. Like a gamification for nodes who play an integral role in the maintenance of the structure that supports them. Through voted egregore from the nodes and Agathos protocol (daemon processes)

Audio NFT Minting on Ergo Auctions
Rx the Pharm Tech, one of the founding members of Refraktal, showcases an educational tutorial on how to mint & auction audio NFTs on the Ergo blockchain (w/ a comedic touch to spice it up a bit).

Thank you! Amazing! Do you know when it will be available? Will it be possible to choose these option when minting on ergoutils? Is there also a plan to have series of NFT minted in one single verifiable "minting policy" so that auction houses can then verify that the artwork comes from the same registered policy? @kushti said that it would be working on making this possible.

ya I was waiting to see some more Tovarischs! I definitely dig them. A bummer Yoroi doesn't have a good way to view them


[08/27/2021 2:38 AM] rxart#6096
question for the community:  what do you all think about an Ergo media player type app to playback Audio NFT's, do Picture NFT slideshows, & eventually playback Video NFT's once that gets integrated??


[08/27/2021 2:39 AM] rxart#6096
I've always dreamed of a media player app that also acts as a wallet where you can house your songs/videos/pics & trade with others, buy stuff like iTunes style,  know what I mean??


[08/27/2021 2:40 AM] rxart#6096
I think that would really propel this NFT concept to the next level.  too bad i'm not a coder cuz it just seems like the obvious next step


[08/27/2021 4:48 AM] G. de Balboa#0001
you can go to https://ergonfts.org/ and put in your wallet address with the tokens

- Working on it - will possibly have a testing version up in the next several days and after successful testing, will deploy.
- What options are you talking about that should be in ergoutls?
- The policy thing is doable without breaking anything. I have no timeline for that now honestly. My plan is to implement the current changes for the auction house and then move to the ErgoTeam project. Meanwhile, I'll try to address other issues and features for the auction house.


[08/27/2021 4:00 PM] Foeniculum#3278

@anon_real hi there, I'm trying to relist an artwork.
Is it a problem that it doesn't have an Artwork Checksum?


[08/27/2021 5:34 PM] anon_real#2768
Hey! Why doesn't it have checksum?
You can auction it and it'll be fine but it is not following the artwork staandard.


[08/27/2021 5:34 PM] V__C#6587
I don't know, I bought it a few months back.


[08/27/2021 5:35 PM] anon_real#2768
Ah I see. Maybe that was before the standard was introduced. So it should be fine.

I have an audio NFT on my Yoroi wallet.  Does anybody know where I can listen to it?  all the NFT viewer sites seem to be for Picture NFTs only.  They say audio NFT up top but I don't see my token

I think you go to ergonfts.org and connect your wallet address that it's on. @rxart

@anon_real hi, I'm still having an issue with relisting.
After trying a few times to set the bid and transfer the token (1st couple of times it got sent back).
I've now ended up with no listing but erg and the token are now residing on the auction address provided.

Old receiving addresses should work as well I think

Congratulations for your boarding on the Ergo Team spaceship! We are very lucky to have you! Thank you for your time!
1) Regarding the royalty option, is this going to be available on ergoutils for artists when they mint their artworks? Are the royalties something that have to be minted into the NFT from inception and are imposed on all future sales or is that a % that has to be willingly introduced by each seller each time that the artwork sells when they create a sell order/auction? Could you give us more information on how this would work? 
2) Regarding the minting policy, is there a way to mint say 50 tokens that are all part of a limited run that can be verified by an escrow service to make sure they are all originals and not copies? Maybe they could check that a verified wallet issued them in the first place? Would that be enough though?
3) Another great addition would be to be able for the seller to choose between 1) an auction AND/OR 2) a "BUY NOW" button (if it's easy to add)

[08/28/2021 3:49 PM] anon_real#2768
Thanks!
- Royalty can not be enforced at the NFT level because once someone owns some token in his wallet, he can do whatever he wants with it without being forced to pay the artist - for example, he can send the NFT to his friend and get cash!
The best thing that can be done is to enforce royalty at the auction level. Meaning that every time an NFT is auctioned, some predefined percentage of the final amount will go to the original artist. This percentage is an auction house config and can be modified - however, is the same for all artists. The artist doesn't need to do anything, the royalty amount will go to the address that has issued the artwork automatically once the auction finishes.

- I think authenticity can be ensured with the artist's address.

- Good idea, will update the new contract accordingly. Since updating the contract and modifying the UI code based on it is a lot of work, please let me know changes like this now that we are updating everything.

Thank you for the answers. 
- An artist with ETH experience tells me the following (which is just a suggestion for you to decide if it is interesting): "I think that you would be able to configure a minimum fee for it to move between wallets. ETH has this function as well I believe when you mint something on rarible and then want to move it to a new wallet outside of the platform. You could possibly also program in a set number of ‚Äúgifts‚Äù or 0 fee transfers if you wanted to transfer it to a friend or between your own wallets. Once those are used up, then every time it moves, there is a minimum fee. It might not end up being what the token is worth in terms of a % commission but at least it‚Äôs something." Would that in your opinion be a better way to do it?

- Is your idea that the royalty will apply to all NFTs (even older ones) that are auctioned in the Auction House and retribute a non variable % fee to the original address where the NFT was minted?
Do you already know what this % will be?

- All coming changes will be on auctionhouse level and not ergoutils?

- Is there going a tool on auction house or anywhere for buyers to verify that the NFTs are really from the artist and not a scammer that would just have copied the whole portfolio?

[08/29/2021 7:58 AM] anon_real#2768
- Account base and UTXO blockchains are different beasts. I don't think it is possible to do this on ERGO because tokens are not bound to contracts - once you have it in your wallet, you can do whatever you want with it, even burn it (maybe @kushti can confirm)

- Yes, royalty will be applied for all NFTs - old and new ones. I will configure this percentage based on the community's feedback.

- Yes, ergoutils doesn't need any change as of now I think.

- We already have this option. On each auction card, the artist's address is specified. So artists can share their page like this: https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/active?type=picture&artist=9f6C29rQyBwMcc5j9r9x5qMMbuxT17wsedCyefq5GEUcwzVKmzR - more details here: https://www.ergoforum.org/t/some-details-about-ergo-auction-house/428/20?u=anon_real

Without cleaning, the auction will turn into a cloaca of thieves


[08/30/2021 9:15 AM] Sveinbj–ærn#9502
There is another option, if there is a lack of human resources, - create a separate section for selected authors (update once a week/month). This was done on some marketplaces - opensea, bakeryswap (https://gallery.bakeryswap.org/), etc.


[08/30/2021 9:17 AM] Sveinbj–ærn#9502
So, there will be a common uncontrolled trash section and section with chosen/verified artists.

Maybe the best would to take down ergoauctions if it makes bad reputation for ergo overall.  Maybe only a centralised solution like cnft can really work, unfortunately.

[08/30/2021 8:43 PM] manansh#7167
would anyone here be interested in sharing their feedback on Ergo Auction House? I do UX research and would love to see how we can improve this dApp.

Looking for answers to questions like:
- What does your workflow look like? (designing -> minting)
- What sucks about using the Auction house?
- Why are you minting NFT's on ergo?
- Which parts of the Auction House works well?
- If you had a magic wand, what would be one thing you would change?

Stuff like that. Let's see if we can find ways to really improve the experience.

maybe making new adresses (or all) wait 30 days to "checkout" from auction house after the nft was sold, and add a system to rollback transactions in case fraud is verified

Is it possible to mint different 200 NFTs in a same collection in a single transaction or do we have to manually mint 200 NFTs waiting a long time and leaving the possibility for others to start copying our collection while we are still minting it? Besides the problem that it takes a long time, it is an accounting nightmare to have to make the accounting for 200 mintings instead of just 1. Imagine just having to screenshot every step of the process for your accounting, you have to make 2000 screenshots during the process. Besides that, each collection must have a way to be specified to be in a limited edition "verifiable policy" that gives more assurance to buyers that even the artist cannot change the number of NFTs in the same collection, otherwise even the artist is loosing value because he cannot guarantee this. Cardano NFTs have already done that, they are also on eUTXO, it could be exactly the same system. Ideally, we should be able to simply give a sort of standardised CSV list of NFTs with IFPS address, title, description, author, and so on. Regarding the visual aspect of the auction house, there are already so many existing on Ethereum, that's it's quite easy to be inspired from what already works.

Crazy idea, but the auctionhouse contracts can be used for long term forced banking. Make a disgusting NFT that no one wants, place a fat bid, and set it to close in 10 years.

I don't see this as the right action. Even if that was possible, doing so would hurt the decentralized aspect of the AH and means that I could do it another time if I want to censor something.

Just saw all the #PaulRobertson art in the auctionhouse... Any chance it's authentic? 

He's a pretty big name.... and "PIXEL ART BY 1x1" doesn't show up as anything representing anything.
I know there's been some conversation about it above... 

Based on the nature of the blockchain... 
it's a bad look but not much to do about it without opening the whole system up to manipulation... Right?

[09/04/2021 5:28 PM] anon_real#2768
NFTs and auction contracts are on different abstract levels. I mean if you issue your NFT now, you will be able to use any new functionalities later in v1 or any future versions.

For example, already issued tokens will also support artist royalty.


[09/04/2021 5:29 PM] anon_real#2768
So feel free to use v0 if you intend to have a relatively short auction duration. If you want them to be active for weeks, then maybe you should wait a few more days )

Say you have an overzealous seller list for 100 erg and is receiving no bids. I could post an offer of 80 and maybe they would take it

[09/05/2021 6:39 PM] anon_real#2768
If you elaborate on what exactly is needed, I may be able to add it to ErgoUtils. It already supports some airdropping options though.


[09/05/2021 6:40 PM] Foeniculum#3278
Let's say I have 40 NFTs and I want to drop 1 each to 40 addresses


[09/05/2021 6:40 PM] Foeniculum#3278
just like the airdrop function for tokens on Ergoutils!


[09/05/2021 6:41 PM] anon_real#2768
No, it is quite different. Each NFT is a separate token with a different token ID.


[09/05/2021 6:41 PM] anon_real#2768
So I don't think that is possible currently.


[09/05/2021 6:42 PM] anon_real#2768
You mean 100 different NFTs (different tokens with different IDs) or a token with quantity of 100 which happens to have an artwork attached?


[09/05/2021 6:43 PM] Foeniculum#3278
Ouch, thank you!


[09/05/2021 6:44 PM] quokka#1273

Could it be possible to add a p2p trading option on the auction house?  Send token in, user 2 send ergs in, then the transaction between the two occurs. I've traded NFTs on Cardano and it's mostly trust.  Send ada to the guy, hope he send the nft back lol

Yes, technically when the quantity is more than one, it is not NFT anymore xD
So, yes it is possible. I think what you are saying is similar to mining NFTs under some policy. It needs some thinking and a standard first which hopefully will be done soon after the current things are done.

Is there an active list of what's currently planned? I'm sure I might be repeating someone but...

It would help to define what default artist params are on an Ergo NFT, to allow the artist to define more than their Wallet address.
To basically make it easier for our #ERGOartists #ErgoNFT artists to appear consistent on the auction house, and rather than trying to make everyone go through some kind of review/reverse image process... 
focusing on giving our actual artists a way to stand from the very great art that is being stolen and uploaded along side their art.

Something like adding a few default settings similar to what is found on an Mp3 file...
'Artist':  @Foeniculum 
'Title': "Ergnome 420 : Suger bear" 
'Series': "Banana Rocket - 2"
'Promo_Link': "www.ERGnomes.io"
'Validation_Link': "www.ERGnomes.io/validation/9akm2df7sdfnjisdfv76fdg98sd6d79fn67"

Based on how ERGnomes are defined, ErgoNfts.org reads our metadata and displays it very nicely and consistently, which involved us adding a json blob to the R5 register; in the form of an 721 definition.

[09/08/2021 5:44 AM] LADOPIXŒ£L#6072
I have not discussed it with anyone (only with you @Foeniculum and @weskinner). 
I started to work on getting it displayed on the ergonfts.org website and on a form to generate the .json in a user-friendly way on ergonfts.org (the form is not finished yet).

The issue was discussed in the development channel and nobody from the community has commented on it:

https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/669989266478202917/862716650007560202

That is why I thought it was best to adapt ergonfts.org urgently to the needs of ERGnomes, since you are the only ones who have spoken out and had the need, and leave the door open to adapt ergonfts.org to what the community says in the future.

I'm open to making any necessary modifications, just let me know and I'll get to work on it.

Why does the owner need to pay the initial bid?


[09/08/2021 8:32 AM] anon_real#2768
Please try again and it should be fine. It is because you've placed bid near the end of the auction and its time has to be extended with your bid.


[09/08/2021 8:33 AM] anon_real#2768
It is just the initial amount. It doesn't need to be a big amount!

[09/08/2021 8:35 AM] vegycslol#1714
Sure but that makes it impossible to set the limit higher than what you have


[09/08/2021 8:36 AM] anon_real#2768
What do you mean by limit? You can adjust the minimum step to force bidders to increase the bid by any amount you wish.


[09/08/2021 8:38 AM] vegycslol#1714
Example: I'm a poor artist, have 1 erg (tested how it works), want to sell my nft for 500 ergs, so i need to put first bid 1 and step 499. However such a step is annoying since i can't sell it for 501-998 erg for example


[09/08/2021 8:39 AM] anon_real#2768
That is right. Let me think about a solution.


[09/08/2021 8:42 AM] anon_real#2768
Ok, so in the new version, we will have a `minimum bid` parameter instead of `minimum step`. Which means there are two requirements for a bid: 1- it should be bigger than the previous one, 2- it should be bigger than `minimum bid`


[09/08/2021 8:44 AM] vegycslol#1714
Does that mean that people would be able to outbid you for 1 nanoergo?


[09/08/2021 8:46 AM] vegycslol#1714
If yes and if the auction autoextends then i can make sure the owner gets his money after 10 years by just repeatedly doing that (if i understand the auction correctly)


[09/08/2021 9:00 AM] anon_real#2768
Well, you will have  to pay tx fee and lock your `2 * bid` ERGs for 10 years xD
But yes, that is possible.


[09/08/2021 9:06 AM] vegycslol#1714
How contracts work (on any chain) is still a mistery to me. I'm guessing you pay tx fee for each bid, but why do you lock `2 * bid`?


[09/08/2021 9:08 AM] anon_real#2768
You'll have to pay the tx fee (miner fee) each time. And you'll have to have at least `2 * bid` ERGs to do that repeatedly (`bid` is locked in the auction and `bid + 1 nanoerg` for the next time you want to repeat the process)


[09/08/2021 9:09 AM] vegycslol#1714
Oh right, makes sense tnx


[09/08/2021 9:11 AM] anon_real#2768
No worries. But yes, that's a legitimate concern, will account for that.

[09/08/2021 12:05 PM] vegycslol#1714
Example: person A (actually 2 person behind the scenes) and person B are biding on item X. If person A always bids for 1 nanogrin more, then he can (with not many outbids) make sure it becomes late for person B who needs to go to sleep now üòÑ (note that A doesn't have this problem since it's 2 persons, one sleeps the other one bids) so person B is either forced to stay awake and die trying to outbid the other guy or start biding more aggressively so that the price converges faster. I'm not sure if that's really an issue or not honestly, but maybe a min-step defined as % of the current price (didn't really think much about that, just an idea) might help converge faster

Or hide


[09/08/2021 10:16 PM] Zimulakra#7908
I've DM'd @anon_real about a design to allow for opt in curation.

Basically any artist could mint a token to their own wallet, the token name would be the minting_address of an artist that they approve. Anybody could filter the auction house to see who a certain artist approves.

We could even have a web of trust to filter for one artists list plus one (or more) degree of separation to cast a wider net of community approved artists.

If an artist address is compromised or becomes a bad actor simply move their address token to a burn wallet, or we could have a blacklist where the token name could be "minting_address blacklist"

Hi @anon_real , I tried opening a new auction.  I've send 2 separate transactions with yoroi:  https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/0619338739c69ec249e0ce2fd8ceb4712ab1b55b0321da92389567135a4e1ea1

Im curious is yoroi is involved on the backend of utils/auction house. If so I keep seeing people stating they are having issues with Yoroi. Although mine has been able to send/receive wiht no issues, that might be the reason why.

If an auction did not go through, how long for the payment sent to NFT process is refunded?


[09/09/2021 6:49 PM] bk#4411
I think the issue is that the assembler is reporting the results as JSON but isn't return valid JSON.  See https://github.com/anon-real/ergo-assembler/blob/e626f6f1fc72e1d3b7505b89b927ffdfce28c7c8/app/controllers/Controller.scala#L103.  It's returning a `string` but not escaping as JSON.  (ie, no quotes). So then the `response.json()` fails on the frontend.

Saw that IPFS is now supported by auction house, will it simply pull the data from the metadata as to location of file and display it? Will this work when using ergoutils as well so we no longer need to upload it to imgbb?

I have started an auction but can't see it in the Active Auction page!
Starting an auction is basically waiting for an transaction representing the auction to be mined. Depending on the network traffic, it may take a few minutes for the transaction to be mined and you see your auction. if you keep the app open, you will be notified about the status.

Hi, community!

Most of the work for V2 auction house is done! There are a lot of new features and improvements in the new version - and more UX improvements will come after the initial release like identifying artists with name and socials links.

There are a few things that we need to decide.
- What should the artist royalty percentage be?
- In the new version, there is no need for the seller to place the initial bid. So basically the seller will be able to start the auction with a negligible amount of ERG or any other currency like SigUSD. If there are no bids for the auction then the seller won't be charged any fees either by the auction house or for the royalty and everything will be returned to him. I am thinking this will cause a lot of junk auctions since it is basically free to start one. I am thinking about adding a starting fee for auctions like 0.1 ERG which will be used for further development of the AH.

Please provide feedback. @cc @UpwindStrategy - King de Medici @LADOPIXŒ£L @Armeanio @Zimulakra @Foeniculum and others. Please spread the word and discuss.

If there will eventually be a way to search by artist I wouldn't worry about "junk auctions".  Thoughts on the royalties... I think it would be great but going to have to find a % where everyone is happy.  If too high.. People will trade without using the auction house.  Maybe put it to a vote?


[09/13/2021 2:47 PM] anon_real#2768
Junk auctions will also decrease performance and cause other issues over time.


[09/13/2021 3:00 PM] vegycslol#1714
i agree with fee to avoid spam, less items also makes searching for relevant ones easier. Can the royalty % be picked by the artist (maybe on some limited range)? I'm not saying that's a good thing, am just wondering. Can the user still define minimum bid and minimum step in V2?

[09/13/2021 3:08 PM] anon_real#2768
Royalty percentage in the current approach is a global config which will be applied to all tokens. So artists can't choose for themselves with the current solution, let me think to see if that is possible without changing a lot.

[09/13/2021 3:13 PM] anon_real#2768
Ok, so let's have a vote for, 1.5, 2 or 2.5?


[09/13/2021 3:17 PM] pbr713#9954
what about a sliding percentage point in regards to value? $=1% $$=2% and so on down the line


[09/13/2021 3:25 PM] anon_real#2768

5% (opensea up to 10%)


[09/13/2021 4:53 PM] Armeanio#0321
The royalty contract is probably the largest incentive we can put forward to attract artists.

I think having a healthy/competitive royality (5%) as well as a listing fee to offset spam (as well as fund future development) are both great ideas.

+1 for 5%


[09/13/2021 6:09 PM] vegycslol#1714
5% means that if deal is done for 100 the seller gets 95 and artist 5 right?


[09/13/2021 6:11 PM] pbr713#9954
yes.. at least that what I think it means


[09/13/2021 6:20 PM] anon_real#2768
Currently, the auction house fee is 2%. So if an artwork is sold for 100$ let's say, the seller will get 93$, the artist will get 5$ and the auction house will get 2$.

[09/13/2021 6:34 PM] anon_real#2768
No, the auction fee is a separate thing that I am willing to change upon the community's request. The listing fee is to avoid spam because otherwise starting an auction in V2 is free; if there is no bid for the auction in V2, no fee will be paid to the auction house or artist.

[09/13/2021 7:02 PM] LADOPIXŒ£L#6072
- In Harmony you can choose up to 50%, but I think it is very much, I think 2.5% can be fine.
- Not having to pay can attract garbage auctions, but I don't think they last long, being garbage auctions almost certainly, not selling your product will invite you not to come back very often. On the other hand, if you don't need to have coins to auction a work, you can attract other new artists who find it difficult to get the first coins.

Hey @anon_real what's up?
People are just chatting and looking for auction house improvements, knowing you're not on the telegram NFT channel, I've decided to gather them all and bring some for you.
.
1 - issue - to many fakes around, ripped from ETH and added on Ergo.
2 - home page integrated showing all the NFTs (audio-image-othertokens)
3 - a filter button for it
4 - compressed images for have a better navigation
5 - add notification button
6 - verification tag linked to created NFTs (I don‚Äôt know if this is possible)
7 - image cover for music and other tokens
8 - it would be awesome to have something like this in terms of authenticity/proof or historial images on the artist link, is it possible?
There are other ideas to but that's it in the meantime. thanx for your hard work.

Hey!
1- I didn't get this one, please elaborate.
2- Sure.
3- Sure.
4- Sure, but after V2 release, it needs some changes that takes more time.
5- Sure, will be in V2.
6- Not sure what you mean. We already show the artist's address for each NFT. And we'll show the artist's name and socials later as well.
7- This requires the artwork standard (eip 4) to be changed, let me think a bit.
8- It is possible but after V2, like (4) it requires more time and changes.

Would def like to see a verified artist page for sure, a la CNFT way with a checkmark based on address.

Is there a real need to use full address for ipfs? can we not simply use  "image": "ipfs/QmPrAE5E4tcoY6WAAKCw2L4jXADSasq91PV1StdXaXV9", @anon_real

Not sure where you mean.


[09/15/2021 7:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
i see that the example you showed of ergnomes uses full ipfs address, including the "https://ipfs.io/" followed by the ipfs/<hash> is it possible to have it pull up with only the hash and not need to include the ipfs.io portion? Thinking about future, in some universe where https://ipfs.io/ stops working, but the rest of network is still accessible via other portals

I don't think so. It has to be loaded from a domain like ipfs.io or cloudflare like the auction house is doing.


[09/15/2021 7:18 PM] anon_real#2768
If ipfs.io stops working, nothing bad happens. Files are safe, only another domain can be used for loading them.

Anything can be uploaded but the auction house only supports eip 4  asset types. Currently they are picture and audio. In V2, it'll be picture, audio + optional cover, video.

Well, I would say it is 90% ready. The rest is minor changes and testing. There is a discussion going on about adding governance token to the auction house which will make its management a lot more decentralized and potentially solves the "stolen arts" issue. The release date depends on how that goes, let's see.

@anon_real  I  noticed that if the ergoauctions.org window opens zoomed out with enough room to show all 9 initial Auctions and there's no room to scroll, it doesn't seem able to load any additional Auctions.

I had my monitor vertical and zoomed out and thought something was wrong with my connection, or worse, but when I zoomed back in, and could scroll down a little, it could load again.

 Just figured you might want to know, because if I was new, I might have thought the ergo auction could only load  9 things for some reason üòõ

@anon_real ! Hey I have a question about support for SFTs üôÇ if you're free sometime üôÇ


[09/21/2021 12:17 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
I was talking to @LADOPIXŒ£L about supporting images for SFTs a while back, the wallets should be supporting them.
Specifically for the ErgoManifesto Tokens :ergo_orange_fill: ‚úä 

And he brought up something that made me wonder if we could support SFTs on the auctionhouse.

@LADOPIXŒ£L ‚Äî Today at 12:15 PM
> I remember we were talking about it, and I even did some code to display the image (I have to look it up).

> You can create a normal token (fungible 600,000 coins for example), and in the R5 field define a .json structure to load the URL of an image uploaded to IPFS.

Sounds like we've got some testing to do!

The question was with all the stuff you're doing @anon_real for the auctionhouse, maybe you could lump in the ability to set the R7 in the utility tools so we could issue SFTs with images attached using ErgoUtils?

There's been a desire in the community to mint series Tokens... like the ascii art that https://twitter.com/maritsaart has made before... 

And I think it would be great to allow traditional artists a way to mint prints of an IRL piece of Art...

[09/21/2021 9:42 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
Thank you @glasgowm 
The idea stemmed from talking to my traditional artist about his works and wanting to create NFTs for his work and he wasn't sold on the idea of selling 1-for-1 copies of his art... for some reason.

but he was more interested in selling limited "prints" of a painting, because he already goes through this process for selling physical prints of his works, so he could more easily integrate that concept into his process.


[09/21/2021 9:45 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
Basically creating a "Painting" token, similar to a "Kushti" token, and they would both be able to point to a picture url.

Guys, I have another (better) solution for royalty that enables artists to configure the royalty percentage when minting the NFT. However, with this approach, already minted artworks will have 0% royalty. What do you think? @cc @UpwindStrategy - King de Medici @LADOPIXŒ£L @Armeanio @Zimulakra @Foeniculum and others.

üëè (3) ‚ô•Ô∏è 

[09/21/2021 3:45 PM] anon_real#2768
Also, with this approach, if another auction house comes around, can read the royalty percentage that the artist has set. So it can be a standard.


[09/21/2021 3:47 PM] Armeanio#0321
Moving forward it is probably worth the tradeoff.

One benefit existing nft artists have is greater visibility/awareness for any future work. 

I would imagine future flexibility is a larger incentive.

Hi. I tried to create an auction in ErgoAuctions a few hours ago, and ErgoAuctions returned my funds, but didn't tell me the reason. 

You can see the transaction where I sent the NFT and the required amount of ERGs here: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/4014545c3a6e4c2bbb9b9ba6599228984359fdb0a9c6286d2892b4e13f391b1f .

About 30 minutes later, Ergo Auctions displayed a message saying "Your funds are being returned to you". No reason was given. The transaction where the funds and the NFT were returned are here: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/125250f2b898888a4c81d47c18049df5025d61f315b5c620439223a1ea00b1a0.

Between the two transactions, my auction was not shown on the ErgoAuctions website.
My auction had a duration of 21600 blocks. So, it should have lasted about 30 days. (The initial bid was 10 ERG and the increment was 1 ERG, in case this is relevant.)

Does anyone here knows what went wrong? (It is the first time I tried to use ErgoAuctions. So, it could have been a stupid mistake from my part.)


[09/25/2021 1:45 PM] anon_real#2768
Hey, sorry about that. I believe you are using node based on the tx I am seeing.


[09/25/2021 1:47 PM] anon_real#2768
Auction house assumes you are using Yoroi and since Yoroi send 0.01 ERGs with tokens, things get a bit messed up (in auction house v2 this will be solved).
So you actually have to send 10.002 ERGs from your node alongside your NFT for the auction to start.


[09/25/2021 1:49 PM] anon_real#2768
V2 will support this as well.

[09/25/2021 7:07 PM] Bruno#5958
@anon_real , thanks for the answer.

I was actually using Yoroi, not the node, to submit the NFT and the 9.992 ERGs to the address provided by the auction house... It was quite cumbersome for me to send the exact amount and the NFT from Yoroi. I couldn't figure out how to send the NFT and a specified amount of ERGs using Yoroi. So, I had to use Yoroi's "Send all ERG + all tokens" option and I had to ensure that I had a balance of exactly "9.992 + transaction fee" in my Yoroi wallet.  

It seems that, when the user chooses the "Send all ERG + all tokens" option, Yoroi doesn't have the issue that you described (i.e. the sending of 0.01 ERG together with the token). It might be a good idea to keep this in mind for the fix for this issue that you have planned for V2.

I have two follow-up questions:

1) When is V2 planned to be released?  (Then I will decide if I wait for V2, or if I try again with V1.)

2) (Probably a dumb question) How can I send an NFT and some ERGs  using Yoroi without having to use the "Send all ERG + all tokens" feature?


[09/25/2021 10:26 PM] anon_real#2768
Oh, in that case, just send the NFT, and after the tx is mined, send the asked amount of ERGs (9.992 in your case). It will work just fine.
V2 is almost finalized and I think will be up in two weeks.

Stupid question possibly, to create an auction on the auction house you need to do two separate transactions right?  One for the asset and the other for the starting price?


[09/27/2021 3:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
2 transactions, I usually send the erg first then the NFT

i don't know if ergo already supports limited edition fungible tokens (like stickers that you collect for an album) but you could create that with your images. That way your images would be cheaper and people would maybe want to collect the whole set. Although ergonfts page would then need to show "albums" to make it better looking üôÇ So basically we should have a standard for nft collections so that they can be easily shown as a sticker album etc. Great images btw

because they misunderstood how the listing process works and only listed it for 60 minutes.

We added search for our PROMO #ergnomes so if you see any promo ERGnomes in the auctionhouse you can go to https://ERGnomes.com/gnomesearch and put in the NFT id and it will tell you if it's a fake.

[10/06/2021 7:02 PM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
@quokka 
What would be the benefit of releasing a collection searchable by a single address? so you can link to them? I believe metadata is coming to #auction-house for v2 and so you should be able to sort them...  right?@anon_real  ? 

IMO Using the wallet address represents an identity, which people can understand, whoever minted all these must be the right person...  but using multiple isn't advised.

We used 2 wallet addresses for our Promos and 1 for our Series 1 and it seems like the more wallets we use, the harder it becomes to make it clear to users which ones are the real ones. 

IMO a policy id seems MORE confusing to me... at least people know what a wallet address is by default, because it's another thing for people to understand... but it would pair nicely with cardano...


[10/06/2021 7:03 PM] quokka#1273
You‚Äôre right using multiple wallet addresses makes everything more difficult. I said policy ID because that‚Äôs the only other option I know Bc of cardano. If there is a better solution out there then it‚Äôs very welcome lol

Hey everyone! 

We're seeing a lot of fake ERGnomes in the action house. They are getting pretty intricate too. Same image, different metadata and descriptions. I know there are many more counterfeit and copyright NFTs in there too.

I'm wondering if there's a way to implement some sort of flagging feature? I know we can't stop people from posting fakes, but maybe we can allow the community to flag them? I hate seeing these fakes pop up...  but I mostly feel terrible for anyone dumping their hard earned ERG on them.

Any thoughts?

@anon_real I‚Äôm having issues with the auction house - can I dm you?


[10/08/2021 4:44 AM] owlt#4164
essentially I got refunded the ERG for my failed auction (probably timed out) but didn‚Äôt get refunded my NFT.

an issue is that I assumed the NFT refunded back to me. so I continued setting up the auction again -  I sent the required ERG for the initial bid and then realized I didn‚Äôt have the NFT. currently the second initial bid and NFT are sitting in the wallet and an auction has not started.

unfortunately those assets have been sitting in there for around an hour. any help on fixing the issue?

thanks! üôÇ

Is there a problem with https://www.ergonfts.org/ ? I can't view my NFTs.


[10/09/2021 8:26 PM] Zimulakra#7908
It seems like since yesterday most of the fake/stolen NFTs have been filtered out of the Auction House. Has anybody heard any official news on this? @anon_real

Don't fall for FAKES. Cypherkicks are only available on #Cardano -- Don't buy Cypherkicks on other blockchains, those are scams. 

Please feel free to DM me if you are about to buy a Cypherkicks and are not sure if they are originals.

@anon_real I put one nft on the auction house for a friend, however its not showing up as an active auction. I have sent both the first bid amount and the token to the provided address can you look into it?

Address used for setting up the auction and sending bid amounts - ``9i3JaYLtDvfJU2nN2LeBFhBJMWR1vG9hnqeVLRLTLSrHCoe7U3M``

Auction House Address at which funds are stuck - ``2Bgo5pjW1XN8hC3PBWCdpYiTvSfcfPaDMNc4nMf2saue3CyGfaoNcX6DiMMp4JT8kDgPEBTVWw8CJqGGtUrHJiNyomvhnC5vyQRYrzeUtbsM6HKsFCuq1yfMNYedi4xtYmQSQ2HA94HfJqQvKmiDop776zcboahTonGCNLY3GPgnrvbdZnAunnQzrFcAjYd2GeGJdr9bkpSYFcBH7J5mArknGcWviCboNv9AWXMz2MpcwJMNDoQ1iubaifxxDsFXMDrDeD1KeJzQwGANW``

[10/22/2021 2:54 PM] quokka#1273
@anon_real So the most important thing for an NFT is the artist address, but wouldn't a scammer be able to replicate that by using the artist's address when minting a fake on ErgoUtils? I know this means that the ERG made on the auction goes to the artist lol but isn't that still possible?


[10/22/2021 4:25 PM] anon_real#2768
That is not the address. Artist address is the address of the first input of the tx that has minted the NFT. So only artist can have that. If that address is a proxy address, artist address is the address of the first input of the tx that has sent the funds to the proxy address.


[10/22/2021 4:30 PM] anon_real#2768
This is why it is good for artists to have a wallet that has one address only to make sure that NFT‚Äôs artist address will be the same always. For V2, I am planning to write a forum post explaining to artists the best way to use the AH.


[10/22/2021 4:49 PM] quokka#1273
Okay!! Love to hear that. I knew my logic was wrong somewhere so I had to ask. Thank you for the response.

[10/23/2021 8:50 PM] Luivatra#9076
I scan through all the tokens to look for picture nft's, I download each one and calculate a perceptual hash for each and store it in a database together with minting info (time and address) then I take each nft and compare its hash with all older nft's that are minted by other addresses and store any relatively close matches in the database, finally I expose both tables through a rest api at https://ergolui.com/nft-check/

[10/23/2021 8:54 PM] anon_real#2768
That‚Äôs great! How reliable is this perceptual hash? I mean how probable is it to have false positives and cotegorize an NFT as fake when it is actually legit?


[10/23/2021 8:56 PM] anon_real#2768
All features are implemented and tested except artist verification and artist info feature which is WIP. Let‚Äôs see how the testing goes with the help of @pbr713 and @Foeniculum

[10/23/2021 8:56 PM] Luivatra#9076
If you set the threshold low enough it is fairly low chance of false positive. if the hash_compare value is 0 it is 99.99% a copy. You could maybe put a warning with different levels, like a red warning sign if there is a copy with hash_compare value of 0, yellow if between 0 and 0.1 etc

what is your user on github @anon_real then I can invite you to the git repo, didnt want to make it public so the scammers cant see what exactly we are using to detect üôÇ


[10/23/2021 9:05 PM] anon_real#2768
Great! The only question is, what is a reliable threshold number? 0.05 let‚Äôs say?


[10/23/2021 9:05 PM] Luivatra#9076
Probably, it depends what is worse, a false positive or a false negative


[10/23/2021 9:06 PM] Luivatra#9076
I have been running with 0.1 and havent run into an issue yet


[10/23/2021 9:07 PM] anon_real#2768
If you could add another check to your code to make the false positive probability lower that would be amazing.


[10/23/2021 9:07 PM] anon_real#2768
Since for a specific artist, it is possible that artworks are very close (with different traits for example)


[10/23/2021 9:07 PM] Luivatra#9076
yes but that is why I do not check if it is from the same minting address


[10/23/2021 9:08 PM] anon_real#2768
If you could check the artist address and if for both cases the address is the same, then it is not fake


[10/23/2021 9:08 PM] anon_real#2768
Oh you do already?


[10/23/2021 9:08 PM] Luivatra#9076
yup, I was worried the ergnomes looked too much alike, so worked that in from the start üôÇ


[10/23/2021 9:08 PM] anon_real#2768
Amazing! So what exactly do you check, which address?


[10/23/2021 9:10 PM] Luivatra#9076
get tokens from the tokens api, fetch the boxid that is listed there, fetch the tx from the box, look at the first input for a 9* address, if it isnt I check the outputtx of that input box etc.

if str(data['inputs'][0]['address']).startswith("9"): 
                mint_address = data['inputs'][0]['address']
            else:
                mint_address = "unknown"
                while not mint_address.startswith("9"):
                    r = requests.get(self.url+data['inputs'][0]['outputTransactionId'])
                    data = r.json()
                    mint_address = data['inputs'][0]['address']

No worries, we can have different services in different languages xD


[10/23/2021 9:16 PM] anon_real#2768
Btw, you are cross checking any new NFT with all the old ones, right? Are you doing that one by one?


[10/23/2021 9:17 PM] Luivatra#9076
yes, I am checking the explorer for new minted nft's every 30 or so seconds to get their info, then I compare them to all older ones, it is surprisingly fast, only slow part is ipfs üòõ


[10/23/2021 9:22 PM] anon_real#2768
That should be fine for now. But in a year or so when we have lots of NFTs, that may be an issue. So meanwhile we should try to optimize the procedure somehow.


[10/23/2021 9:25 PM] Luivatra#9076
good point, but it is microservices, so could spin up a bunch more hashers etc.

@Luivatra One possible optimization is to flag addresses as scams. It is hard for scammers to change addresses frequently.

can there be a smart contract driven thing for collaborated NFTs? like what if two artist wanted to collaborate for creating an artwork and wanted the smartcontract to eradicate the need of sharing sales amounts based on trust. Like what if two random people wanted to collaborate and share the sales figures equally without having to depend on each other's honesty,


[10/25/2021 7:06 PM] gilgaMesh#8262
something like the subpooling for miners

This can be supported by V2 down the line. In theory, royalty can go to any smart contract -- this means that royalty can be controlled with any complex contract.

[10/31/2021 9:20 PM] 6directions#1089
@anon_real hey there. Foeniculum from Ergnomes referred me here.
I created an auction nearly an hour ago, sent the asset along with the specified ERG amount, but I am still not seeing the auction listed.
first time I create an auction so not sure if this is normal or not?


[10/31/2021 9:21 PM] 6directions#1089
oh wait a second... I just went to check my wallet to grab the tx id, and noticed the asset and the ERG were sent back? could it be the window of time to send the asset+ERG timed out? should I just try creating another auction?

Days hopefully.


[11/01/2021 6:16 AM] anon_real#2768
Just checked this. This is already supported in V2 but just not being used in the UI!
So the current smart contracts lets you set the royalty address to any other complex smart contract -- this is exciting.
Just a simple example: Artist may set the royalty address in a way that for the fee earned on secondary sales, 20% goes to his staff/devs, 30% to a charity, and the rest to himself. It can get much more complicated than that though.


[11/01/2021 6:18 AM] gilgaMesh#8262
Holy moly, auction house v2 is looking like a really massive upgrade


[11/01/2021 6:18 AM] gilgaMesh#8262
When is it coming


[11/01/2021 6:20 AM] anon_real#2768
Soon hopefully. Btw, it is supported but not reflected in the UI meaning that it can be added to the UI easily down the road without going through a smart contract upgrade -- which is hard to do.
We'll get there step by step )

Yeh the assembler assembles the transactions and submits them. Think that's all the code for ergoauctions and it interacts with the chain using the assembler.

Pretty much exactly the same as the auction house except I only retrieve NFT‚Äôs from my own artist address

Cool. Is there a paper to explain it? Like is it auction house direct to IPFS or is there some middle party?

You can probably find the answer in the source code of ErgoUtils. https://github.com/anon-real/ErgoUtils/blob/master/src/utils/issueArtwork.js

The only thing you should notice is that AH V2 will filter out auctions that have not paid the starting fee. So your auctions should start through the AH V2.

Hey, question for dev for auction house. I sent 2 nfts to AH for posting, not sure what happened (maybe sent nft before confimation from sent erg for posting), both seem to be locked up, not in my assets and not on AH, been about 15 hours. Any idea? thanks. Edit - Pretty sure its because I sent both back to back without waiting for confo


[11/03/2021 6:36 PM] blueAtlas#2195

I am getting some feedback from a few artists and testers. I've been improving AH based on their feedback. @Zimulakra @Foeniculum @quokka thanks for testing. Please let me know any other feedback you may have by the end of this week so I can plan the release. Thanks again!

I think it'd be very useful if you and @LADOPIXŒ£L teamed up to make sure that the same info is shown in similar ways both on the auction house and on ergotokens / ergonfts.org

üëâ  On the auction house for example, we're missing the Token ID (I guess it's at the top, where it says "Artwork details for NFT...", but it's not that clear for newbies).

However, ergotokens.org requires Token ID to find a specific NFT and make sure it's authentic

:Check:  Simple fix: Add "Token ID" to the auctioned NFTs info
üëë  Ideal fix: Add the above + a link that redirects to Ergotokens.org

üëâ ALSO!

Ergotokens.org doesn't show the artist address, while the auction house does. @LADOPIXŒ£L would it be possible to add that field to ergotokens.org NFT info page please?

The changes above would make it extremely easier for newbies to check for authenticity, and it'd streamline searches from the auction house to ergotokens.org

üëâ Finally: issues searching NFTs by name on ergotokens.org

If I try to search a specific Gnomekin / ERGnomes number by typing: "Gnomekin #1234", it will only show the first 20 results that start with "Gnomekin" (i.e. the ones from #0001 to #0019)

However, it won't let me search a specific number cause it doesn't allow me to search for a specific full match of words (in this case, the number #1234 followed by Gnomekin)

For my part, I am delighted to continue improving the websites that I started and I accept help from anyone who wants to participate, in the same way I would be happy to help on other websites.

I have almost finished the code to show the artist's address, but I haven't updated the website yet, I have to check it first.

For the search of the tokens in ergonfts I use (getApiV1TokensSearch) of the API v1 of Explorer and the search conditions are these of the image that I attach.

If you are an artist there are several things that you should take into consideration for using the Ergo Auction House.  It is very important for each artist to have only one specific address that he works with. It means that every artist should have a wallet with only one address in it. This is important for several reasons:   Will be important...

Auction House V2
Ergo auction house has come a long way. At the start, it only supported the node as a wallet and no artworks, only ordinary tokens. Along the way, many features and standards were introduced which resulted in some adoption. Auction house V1 experienced more than 17000 transactions (bids and auctions) which is pretty impressive.  However, it is t...

Hello @anon_real , I have a problem with my auction. I just uploaded one with the minimum step of 1 erg and it doesn't show up like that. I attach the screenshots of how I created it and how it actually comes out in the auction.

[11/11/2021 11:34 AM] 2pB8n#8584
i think you should've entered 1.1 in the minimum bid instead of 0.1 so when people first bid on it it will be 1.1

{Reactions}
üëç 

[11/11/2021 11:42 AM] ERGkleure#7076
So that has changed? I used to put that same data in V1 and the first bid was 1.1. I would like to know for future auctions.


[11/11/2021 12:40 PM] yea.ok#2677
Just minted my first video/audio nft on the platform, just want to say that everything went so smooth and was easy to use. Great job!


[11/11/2021 2:15 PM] quokka#1273
The information and the display looks correct. The initial bid is for 0.1 ERG, and then after someone bids for 0.1 erg, the next minimum bid is 1.1 ERG. If you press the dial button next to the bid button (that says ‚Äúbid for 0.1 ERG) then you can adjust how much you want to bid


[11/11/2021 2:15 PM] quokka#1273
My question is: when you say When the auction ends, is that in your local time or UTC?


[11/11/2021 2:27 PM] ERGkleure#7076
Okay, thank you for your answer. I put exactly the same in V1 and the first bid was always 1.1, not 0.1. That's why I was surprised that now it didn't come out like that and the first bid is 0.1. 
If so then I should put in the top box 1.1 from what I understand.
With respect to the time I believe that it is the local time of each one, or so I have understood it, since the clock appeared to me with the same time of my computer.


[11/11/2021 3:19 PM] quokka#1273

You have to send one transaction with the nft, wait until that‚Äôs confirmed, and then send a second transaction with the amount of ERG it requests


[11/11/2021 6:28 PM] quokka#1273
But I suggest using the dApp connector because doing it the way I said above takes a long time and is extremely tedious


[11/11/2021 9:59 PM] anon_real#2768
No need to wait for confirmation -- although some wallets including Yoroi require that.

As you can see, the third image on the right has the right name / description / bid amount but the wrong image


[11/12/2021 9:27 AM] Foeniculum#3278
also, it looks like it's not possible to mint an NFT into someone's wallet anymore üòÆ it let artists send over artworks right after minting them, instead of doing it in two transactions (i.e. mint to their own address + send)

Hey all. I have some nft that I minted which I messed up on and redid. But I don‚Äôt really want them lying around cause they are duplicates. Is there a way like eth where you can send them to burn?

Anyone running into this? When I start an auction and send the 0.11 erg the smart contract immediatly returns most of it back to me. This makes it impossible to start an auction. Using yoroi.


[11/13/2021 11:24 AM] glasgowm#9381
Had you made another tx before it? nightly is a bit buggy - works fine but needs manually refreshed constantly


[11/13/2021 11:25 AM] Smurfj#9665
Do I need to use Nightly? Because im using normal Yoroi. That might be the problem


[11/13/2021 11:26 AM] glasgowm#9381
Oh right, appears you can connect regular yoroi too. Thought it was only yoroi nightly+dApp connector or the android wallet


[11/13/2021 11:28 AM] glasgowm#9381
Using regular yoroi it would need to still use the assembler so that might be down at the moment. @anon_real

Sorry to be a mouth breather. I have been confirming that art work on V2 is original by checking the posted addresses on the NFT projects twitter account and comparing it to the listed address on V2. Is there an alternate way to confirm an NFT is legit? For instance Space Farmers does not have an address listed on their twitter. In some cases I can't find a twitter account.  Thanks in advance for any help.

[11/16/2021 4:28 PM] ERGkleure#7076
@Rob3 It is always advisable to verify the address of one's wallet. Normally we usually put it in the Twitter account and if not it is better to ask the artist directly.

[11/16/2021 7:11 PM] RŒ£D#7477
Sir it seems as if the new auction house doesn‚Äôt allow custom bid amounts anymore. We have to bid in predetermined increments. This makes bidding significantly more tedious and time consuming. It also increases the likelihood of a bidding war which is frustrating for buyers. Can we go back to the old way when we could enter any bid amount?

[11/18/2021 8:21 AM] ERGkleure#7076
I don't know if you have been able to solve it, what I have noticed is that for the Auction to work properly you must have the Yoroi Nightly wallet updated, with all the latest transactions loaded correctly. I don't know if I'm making myself clear.

@everyone I have been keeping track of the value of the net value of Ergo NFTs of Ergo auction house. It is going down üîª gradually everyday. We are failing to attract new artists and collectors on the platform. That's why I urge everyone to set a low entry bar for bidding on your NFTs. Start some collectable cards of your characters and put them auction. We need to shill about our platform n educate people about Ergo. Listing NFTs on Kushtis might work.

Is there is a way to query the ergo blockchain for auction house related scripts?

For example, I want to filter all active auctions that hold assets by a given artist, so I can monitor when they end and determine what the outcome was.

Or filter all assets by a given artist that are currently in an active auction, whichever makes more sense.

@anon_real Hey man, just an idea... Maybe for now, we can have a report button on the 3 dots on the top right of card. This report feature will basically just send you or someone a message. The message will just be where someone reported something by putting the link to the official artwork from where the fake was stolen from. For instance. 

Legit project... https://www.binance.com/en/nft/shopWindow?reSale=&tradeType=&currency=&amountFrom=&amountTo=&keyword=&orderBy=list_time&orderType=-1&isBack=0&uid=263352904&order=list_time%40-1

Fake Ergo Auctions.
https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/active?type=all&sortKey=0&artist=9fq1fFv5m8t5qt3aG23ZNXnmZJ59x7U2QRigZdLQjbsbWCQ6sQ6

So basically I would just put the real project link when I report and it will, I dunno, send you an email to check it. If you deem it is indeed fake, you can put a label on the card in red or something that says, "Possible Fake" and maybe even link the legit site. 

I know you guys are workin on a database of official projects where you can have artist's work verified by the addresses and such, but I figured this might be a really simple solution for now. Either way no worries, just trying to help! Take care my friend and thank you for all your hard work!

probably depends on the copyright law in your area - ergo doesn't take anything to do with that.

[11/20/2021 2:07 PM] koutelier#5178
i dm the artist of ape dao on discord and told me that only sell on eth. so it's scam for sure

i don't think it's good that so many scams are in our auction house. i would buy from there if i was learning about erg nfts

Guys, I have a question about the ergoauctions.org V2.
When I want to list an NFT, I create an auction, how can I send the asset + the amount of ERG in one transaction?


[11/20/2021 4:56 PM] anon_real#2768
If you are using Yoroi nighty, it will be automatic. If you are using Ergo Wallet Android, scan the qr code and add your NFT.


[11/20/2021 5:03 PM] JonasF#5869
Thanks


[11/20/2021 5:04 PM] anon_real#2768
There has been a problem. It'll be fixed in 2 mins. Thanks for reporting.


[11/21/2021 9:30 AM] dennemann#2965
Is there an issue with Yoroi + connector? I'm just getting wallet access denied


[11/21/2021 11:24 AM] quokka#1273
You must use Yoroi Nightly, the dApp connector doesn‚Äôt work with regular Yoroi


[11/21/2021 11:25 AM] dennemann#2965
I am using yoroi nightly, but got the regular installed as well


[11/21/2021 11:26 AM] quokka#1273
Then the connector should be working with your nightly. Gotta wait for the dev to answer that one lol


[11/21/2021 1:06 PM] Bruin#2798
Trying to list on the AH but every time i send 0.11 ERG it is stuck as 'submitted' My NFT makes it over. Any insight as to what may be wrong, or im doing wrong here? Sending from YN wallet


[11/21/2021 2:05 PM] keen_moron#8681
Thanks I have no issues now


[11/21/2021 3:52 PM] quokka#1273
Are you sending the nft first or the erg? You‚Äôre supposed to send the nft first


[11/21/2021 4:09 PM] koutelier#5178
so you verify?


[11/21/2021 7:32 PM] Bonzo#1571
is anyone else having issues bidding on auctions? I'm trying Yoroi with wallet connect (as I always have) and Yoroi nightly.

I click bid and nothing happens

Same dude!! üò¶


[11/21/2021 8:01 PM] Bonzo#1571
Are you also using Yoroi? I'm wondering if another wallet might work or if this is a problem with AH

It's killing me watching the auction time run up with such a low price.. but I can only imagine how bummed the owner of the auction must be


[11/21/2021 8:07 PM] WoodŒ£rs100#3329
Tried multiple wallets. Yeah it‚Äôs not fair on the owner of the nft. It‚Äôs AH. As you go to click on the bid but nothing happens. No address pop up to where to send the erg to.


[11/21/2021 8:10 PM] Bonzo#1571
damn that sucks. I wish I didn't hold off until the end of the auction

Well, when you specify that you want to place `x` ERG bid, then the smart contract that is expecting your fund, expects `x` ERGs xD
There are some smart people around and imo they have some code scanning all incoming transactions. They will take what they can and it is how it works in blockchain! You should be careful about how much and to what address you send and if you do that **your funds will be safe for sure**

@anon_real "Foeniculum#3278: On the auction house for example, we're missing the Token ID (I guess it's at the top, where it says "Artwork details for NFT...", but it's not that clear for newbies).

Simple fix: Add "Token ID" to the auctioned NFTs info"

[11/23/2021 9:41 AM] ERGkleure#7076
The Ergo Dapp Connector sometimes does not work properly. It gave me problems today and what I did was to do it as it was done before. The first thing is to disconnect the connector. Include the wallet in the part where it says "Any wallet". Go to create artwork and send the payment to the indicated address. Once it has been successfully minted, the next thing is to create the auction. It will give you a price and an address, you must first send the NFT and once the transaction is confirmed you must send the payment to the same address. It is a bit longer process but it works.
I hope I have helped you, greetings.

for ergo.. I cant say much besides general block chain mechanics


[11/23/2021 1:34 PM] pcfreak30#8526
for ETH what happens is you can scan for DEX opportunities from recent transactions or pending (memory pool) and then use that to trigger a high gas transaction to snipe profits, arbitrage


[11/23/2021 1:35 PM] pcfreak30#8526
thats related to miner "MEV"

[11/23/2021 1:36 PM] pcfreak30#8526
if a transaction is in mem pool, its not mined yet, and so  its free market


[11/23/2021 1:37 PM] pcfreak30#8526
its literally having a bunch of transactions in a house pool, and taking the largest out first

Hi!
a strange thing happened yesterday during my auction.
I received a bid of 21 ERG and there were 43 minutes to go.

the auction was closed for 19 ergos, being that it was already at 21 and with time remaining.

can someone help me understand what might have happened? is there anyone i can talk to?

I have all the prints. even the buyer who bid for 21 ergos contacted me to understand what had happened.

@anon_real @LADOPIXŒ£L

Yestarday I reminted my NFT "Clown girl 1/1" with royalty.
The old one was burned here: https://tokenminter.ergo.ga/

Burned NFT:
ID     : cf90aa634ee6d4b63c8449dd0dafe3e34aeb8b0d3ded79053a08a39738683fde
Minting address: 9gjL6bxkASUK4rTyW1VbGGGuZVrxUv7Gc9JitGFMtiDzjuhd7Zt 

New NFT:
ID     : 3f21545956aa26a0153d18dabd4ada26576934aaea80642d04963baf3618d5e6
Minting address: 9gF3KjKMbbrmN5A6sXGMaEETndUzET1gNb4Lcad52RjDhgTwNFe

Both addresses are mine (see my twitter profile https://twitter.com/norellyrain)

When one try to bid on "Clown girl 1/1" auction
https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/specific/469a7a247695befcc0d99c58ee327e59820487958a3d09e2881f858a4c806eff
AH engine says "There is a similar artwork issued before this one...." and points to my burned one  
https://ergoauctions.org/#/artwork/cf90aa634ee6d4b63c8449dd0dafe3e34aeb8b0d3ded79053a08a39738683fde

So AH/ergotokens both should somehow correctly work with burned tokens.

Burning proof:
See "Current address: 9gF3KjKMbbrmN5A6sXGMaEETndUzET1gNb4Lcad52RjDhgTwNFe" in https://ergotokens.org/#/?token=cf90aa634ee6d4b63c8449dd0dafe3e34aeb8b0d3ded79053a08a39738683fde
And check "Tokens: None" in explorer

@anon_real I found error. When one click on link "See potential original" there is no "=" between "&artist" and wallet address, example for my case: https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/active?type=all&artist9gjL6bxkASUK4rTyW1VbGGGuZVrxUv7Gc9JitGFMtiDzjuhd7Zt


[12/01/2021 11:32 AM] LADOPIXŒ£L#6072
Regarding the token burning, I can't tell you anything, I don't know the exact code used to burn them, although I imagine what it does is unlink from your wallet.

I want to believe the code does something like this (as explained to me a few days ago).
- You add this >>  .tokens.add(token);
- You omit this >> .add_token(tokenId, tokenAmount);

But it makes me think that if we look for some information through transactions made with that token, they have to appear, since they are transactions that were made.

If you look in https://ergowallets.org/#/?wallet=9gjL6bxkASUK4rTyW1VbGGGuZVrxUv7Gc9JitGFMtiDzjuhd7Zt you see that it doesn't come up, because the result is not based on the transactions that were made with that token.

In any case, I am still investigating new ways to show the mint address and the current address.

@taikatytto you can jump on https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/issues/1322 , to burn tokens you need to just skip them in outputs (for custom tokens sum in outputs can be less than sum in inputs, for ERG, strict equality is required). Please note that an asset can be partly burnt partly transferred in a single transaction, do sanity inputs checks accordingly

Thus, in a token burn transaction it is just disappears.

The burn token feature I implemented is visible at: https://github.com/ThierryM1212/ergo-token-minter/blob/main/src/index.js#L254, the important steps to me are:
  1) Select the input boxes for the amount of tokens to burn and a small amount of ERG
  2) Create the output boxes without considering the tokens, the transaction builder will create an additional output change box including all the tokens
  3) Get the transaction json
  4) Re-write the output change box in order to remove the tokens you want to burn
  5) Send the modified transaction (json)

Yes, AH and the copy detector tool does not consider burning. I am not sure if that is bug-free to consider burning. Let me think about it.

@anon_real@Luivatra
I seen here artists with several addresses/already minted tokens (as I am), so it is not only my case. Copy detector must have option to add more then one address per artist to prevent false positive. Regardless of whether the token is burned or not.

Thanks for explanation. But I wrote about something else :).  I think devs (anon_real, Ladopixel) need some tool/API which says is that concrete token (by ID) was burned or not.


[12/02/2021 8:39 AM] Luivatra#9076
why mint the same nft multiple times with different addresses?


[12/02/2021 8:51 AM] Luivatra#9076
I read a bit further up now (sorry cant keep up to date with all channels XD) Regarding the burning, I could update the db by making sure all nft's have an unspent box related to them. Biggest exploitable "problem" I could see is that someone burns a legit nft to remint it and get the future royalties on that, but I can't imagine that being very lucrative, because the scammer would need to own the nft. There is however a bigger issue for the artist. Consider an NFT that gets minted by the artist and at a later point in time the nft gets burned (on purpose for reminting or accidentally) and in between the original mint and the remint someone has made a copy nft. This copy nft would initially be marked as a copy, but would become the original upon burning so the remint is still marked a copy. It is probably possible to code around all this, but I am afraid it could get messy. It is important to know how big of an issue this is and whether it is an issue going forward, or only now in the aftermath of the switch from AH v1 to v2

If the artist address is the same for both tokens, then yes it won't detect as fake. So In your case it is not the same. Have you followed the artist guideline I have posted?

I bid on an NFT and the UI on Auction House never updated to show my bid. The funds were sent from my wallet. The auction is now over. If you click active auctions you can see the one I bid on along with many others show 0 mins. I was just wondering why this is? If I lost out on the auction I guess I will get my money back?

So no bid is removed, it is possible for miners to not mine the tx and things will simply change.

Calling Ergonaut @anon_real for help. 

My ERGO stuck in auction house, when I send it, it didn't place my bet and didn't receive it back, auction is over and nothing.

I found button - Refund request, copied address where my ERG was sent, and some error pop up about check mempool.

Am I doing something wrong here? Or it's YOROI fault?

Bid was placed right when this was happening

Really weird thing happened on Dec, 6th, 2021, between 4 and 7 AM UTC.

Question about an NFT I minted as a test. When I view it on ergotokens it lists the minting address as something other than my wallet. I used the Ergo for Android wallet as instructed. Anyone know why my wallet isn't listed as the minter? 

https://ergotokens.org/#/?token=5f12e8ffce2e0f794ed9ba56c0e8c5f0e495768f83057f5fd5fbaccb79eb8aad


[12/09/2021 2:50 AM] anon_real#2768
In reality, your minting address is 9fHCGhJ3XaHE8CzztKXYSrcYempBEg4b2Ue2otrBMb7U6HDK7FH as AH will show you: https://ergoauctions.org/#/artwork/5f12e8ffce2e0f794ed9ba56c0e8c5f0e495768f83057f5fd5fbaccb79eb8aad


[12/09/2021 2:50 AM] anon_real#2768
The address you see in ergotokens.org is the issuing address which is a proxy contract which will receive the royalty.

@anon_real Not sure if I'm doing something wrong but the first time I click on the direct link to the art you gave me it works fine. But if I try to load the page a second time it is blank white. Same thing happens in Firefox, Edge, and Brave. Works the first time but not the second. If I clear cached data it shows up again.

To mint new nfts in the ergo auction v2 is giving some problems with the connector, it opens 2 new connector windows and they disappear immediately. I tried again and what I did was to hold one of them with the mouse before it disappeared. It's a bit tricky but it works. Also the information inside the connector appears very large and you can't see the button to confirm the transaction, I had to zoom out to be able to sign the transaction. It worked for me this way although I think it is a bit complicated, I guess it can be fixed to work as before.

@LADOPIXŒ£L I think I kno why the minting address is wrong on ErgoTokens for a lot of them. When I mint using the Yoroi dApp connector the menting addres is correct, but hen I do it using the sending method via normal yoroi wallet, the mint address is the smrt contract


[12/13/2021 10:51 PM] quokka#1273

before using the connector go to Yoroi Nightly wallet and update EVERYTHING, then try again to do what you need to do with the connector. It is "working" this way for me.

I leave this information in case it is useful to anyone. As far as I have seen and checked, the connector is no longer needed in the auction, because it is incorporated in Yoroi Nightly. It was giving me some failures and I was getting double the connector, but now I have uninstalled the connector and it works much better. 
What it still does is that the information inside the connector appears very big and you have to use the zoom to make it smaller and sign the transaction.


[12/16/2021 11:19 AM] Gazza_SP#5835
Yeah you can also grab the bottom of the window and expand. The yoroi team are aware of the issue.

is there a way to split royalties with people yet

Auction house needs an nsfw filter if we're gonna go mainstream. Idk who needs to hear it, but dead animals and porn shouldn't be on the main page üò©. I'm all for freedom of expression, but we need the option to toggle the viewing of NSFW content.

I face same issue as @NorellyRain has 
https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/specific/d85792e915f65537b3b588f2d50cbd3447dc61dfe93362115552dd162903c9cd

Luivatra>It is important to know how big of an issue
I burned and reminted 40+ works and about 20+ in queue 

Three reasons of burning and reminting NFTs:
1) anon_real's "Artist Guideline": It is very important for each artist to have only one specific address.
https://www.ergoforum.org/t/artist-guideline/2929
In August, due to Yoroi synchronization errors, I got a second wallet. So about half of my NFTs have old minting address with false positive copy check.
2) I want to move my old NFTs from centralized imgbb.com to ipfs.io
3) royalty

Artist Guideline
If you are an artist there are several things that you should take into consideration for using the Ergo Auction House.  It is very important for each artist to have only one specific address that he works with. It means that every artist should have a wallet with only one address in it. This is important for several reasons:   Will be important...


[12/18/2021 5:45 PM] Luivatra#9076
I dont have time to work out a proper solution to this, but I can quickly work out a solution that links minting addresses together, dm me your minting addresses

[12/18/2021 7:29 PM] anon_real#2768
By one wallet address, I don't mean one kind of wallet. If you have your mnemonic, you can restore and get the same address in any wallet you like.
None of the other things you said is an issue if you use the same address as before! An NFT is not considered to be a copy if the same artist mints it. Sorry, no workarounds, your address is what you are known for in the network and you should have it.


[12/18/2021 7:30 PM] anon_real#2768
Please don't do that. That is not a principled solution.


[12/18/2021 7:32 PM] anon_real#2768
The point of an open-source code and transparent community is that everything can be trusted to work as it is supposed to work. It is not a good solution to have exceptions for people! Then  question people will ask is what if you decide to falsely merge two minting addresses and let some friends copy artworks (Hypothetically)

[12/18/2021 7:41 PM] anon_real#2768
The easiest way is to see if the token does not exist anymore (there is an explorer API for it), then remove it from the list of potential copies.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[12/18/2021 7:41 PM] anon_real#2768
Which is not efficient because for every request you will have to check if the tokens exist.


[12/18/2021 7:50 PM] maritsaart#9875
To be clear.
I understand that. I have full controll of all of my wallets now. But thing is that some big part of my NFTs was minted on old wallet (9euNA... spring-summer), some on new (9gsiBL... autumn-winter). When you told "each artist <must> have only one specific address" - I choose  9gsiBL. So with my issue buyers may see false positive warning.


[12/18/2021 7:52 PM] maritsaart#9875
But on really stolen works there is no warning (from foundation/kalamint/opensea/...) ‚òπÔ∏è


[12/18/2021 7:54 PM] anon_real#2768
Tokens minted before don't support royalty. I don't suggest minting them again for royalty. For imgbb, you don't need to worry about that. One can scrap all artworks on imgbb and upload them to IPFS and keep track of correspondence between them.


[12/18/2021 7:55 PM] anon_real#2768
This is a separate issue that will be solved by artist verification hopefully, work in progress.

@anon_real 
I placed a bid on an auction, it didn't refund, the auction went on for another 20 minutes and then the proxy address moved the funds but I didn't win the auction and the auction completed with someone else with a lower bid winning...
Any idea what happened?

Can I DM you the TX because it was my wife's wallet.


[12/21/2021 6:21 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
Is it because I setup the bid from the auctionhouse on my pc (connected to my wallet) and used her wallet to send the payment? 

My wallet was sending a previous bid, which didn't refund either.

In either case, I have 2 bids from 2 wallets and they sent but aren't showing up to be able to refund... any advice?


[12/21/2021 7:38 AM] anon_real#2768
There is a refund section in the website.


[12/21/2021 7:39 AM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
It's saying it's not in the proxy account anymore.

Hi anon, is there any chance to do a refund after the NFT leaves the AH?


[12/23/2021 1:39 AM] JOFLITO#9983
let's say I am selling a painting NFT with shipping worldwide to the buyer, so instead of the buyer taking the risk of bidding for the NFT and me not sending it, I sell him the NFT and the payment is locked until he recieves the shipping


[12/23/2021 1:40 AM] JOFLITO#9983
it would pass the risk from the buyer to the seller


[12/23/2021 4:50 AM] anon_real#2768
@JOFLITO Not really, that is much more complicated I guess. A third party is needed to check that everything is fine which is impossible for now.

if you can implement a way to hold the payment to he seller for a set amount of time


[12/24/2021 12:39 AM] JOFLITO#9983
it could be seen as a refundable ICO


[12/24/2021 12:45 AM] JOFLITO#9983
I could sell my tokens in batches through the AH, maybe even auction them, make discounts for big buys. And if people don't like it after a while they could return it

If I start an auction with a starting bid of 5 ERG... what amount do I need to send to the smart contract. I am using yoroi. It tells me to send .11 but every time I do it fails. I also tried 5.01 and it fails and says it will be returned.


[12/25/2021 8:40 AM] Foeniculum#3278
you need to send the exact amount that shows in the modal


[12/25/2021 8:41 AM] Foeniculum#3278
if you're auctioning an NFT you've already minted, you need to send the NFT first and then the ERG


[12/25/2021 8:41 AM] Foeniculum#3278
you can do send both in 1 transaction if you're using Android/iOS mobile wallet, or in 2 separate transactions on Yoroi (make sure that the 1st is confirmed before sending the 2nd one)

@anon_real But there is old issue (since AH V2) with changing auction link after each bid. Very inconvenient for worklog.

Here's a recent example:
auction start link: https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/specific/cdc47722e93f251135b2fdfe2f1ed63c34298d619c5dca899bf27890c4ac2b24
link after buying : https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/specific/23374b9e2da11308dfc7ac948212371f09758f3d3c174a0d7d15f8b1f830f3a4

There is some effort going on, e.g. there is a duplicate check and warning before you bid. Top nft platforms face the same issue though and we need to work on decentralized solutions for this "problem".


[12/29/2021 11:38 AM] glasgowm#9381
It's made by an anon developer who values decentralisation and doesn't want to introduce censorship. The code is open source so someone can easily make a clone and provide that service if there's demand - but other community devs have opted to help improve it (such as the duplicate checker). 

Ergo itself is a platform and doesn't provide any dApps or impose any restrictions like that.

[12/29/2021 12:38 PM] WoodŒ£rs100#3329
Understandable. But it can still be decentralised just having the artist minting addresses on there? Instead of Tom dick and Harry posting someone else‚Äôs work.

[12/29/2021 1:02 PM] tdj#1676
maybe to make it decentralized, it must be community-decide which address deserve the verified AH titles.. like decentralized vote maybe.. (hoping one day we can vote president woth blockchain)

 even tho there will still be chance of unfair vote


[12/29/2021 1:03 PM] tdj#1676
the AH community must big enough, so there will small chance of unfair vote and miss-verified address


[12/29/2021 1:04 PM] tdj#1676
just my thought, i dont know if it technically and practically realizeable or not  ü§£


[12/29/2021 1:35 PM] WoodŒ£rs100#3329
That‚Äôs is exactly what I mean.
So on the AH if someone say put a ergnome up for auction. It will have a gnome coin near the minting address. 

It would still be decentralised just a minting address gets verified.

If the artist pay for your time to verify a project and list. ie 5ergs per minting address.


[12/29/2021 3:25 PM] WoodŒ£rs100#3329
Anon doesn‚Äôt have to verify It. That could be done on a thread on the ergo platform to do that. As a group. Then that information is replayed to anon real to apply on AH for a fee from the artist. Also this can be once a month so it‚Äôs not such inconvenience trying to keep up with the nft space.

im flattered ü§ßü§ß..yoroi nightly is getting better and reliable overtime (far better than since beginning).. ergo android/ios wallet also worth to try its easy to use with auction house..  its as easy as scan the qr code and send.. 

but i found a minor issues (really minor issues, not so important) with android wallet

when the qr code is too complex because contain of long smart contract address i cant scan it directly with scan option on ergo wallet (its just happened for complex qr with long smart contract address for example when starting auctions, and its absolutely fine with regular address while create artwork / mint token)

the workaround for now is, scan with regular camera app / qr scanner app and open it as url with ergo wallet app

maybe @MrStahlfelge can help during your freetime üòÅ

p.s
but i havent tested it with another phones.. since i only have 1 android phone and will always be ü§£ might be phone / android version issues

Hi everyone, question about Ergo NFTs:  
On Ergo Auctions, can you create an NFT with a limited run instead of just being 1 NFT total? For instance, I create a picture and say 'only 99 being released ever!'
I haven't seen that option in any of the videos or guides but may have missed it. 
Thank you üôÇ

Hi again, I'm local testing Auction House and I was wondering If you can help me to  modify the " 2% of the final bid will go to the Ergo Auction House" into a 5% and also to add a new fee of 5% that would go to another address. I guess it can be done from consts.js but I don't wanna break something.  Thank you

Go to AH, connect "Any wallet" with your address (just for try) and click "Create Artwork" (menu under plus in circle sign, top right) - you will see a modal with "Quantity" option.


[01/03/2022 4:51 AM] tdj#1676
correct me if im wrong, no royalty on regular transfer.. you can do regular transfer on yoroi nightly (just select your nft token on "select assets" option), or on mobile wallet (just select +Add Token Button)


[01/03/2022 4:52 AM] tdj#1676
make sure you are transferring to NON-EXCHANGE wallet... and make sure its ERGO wallet üòÑ


[01/03/2022 4:55 AM] tdj#1676
u need a little amount of ergo needed to make the ERG transfer valid (u cannot send 0 ERG / only token).. so i usually add the minimum amount 0.001 ERG  then (+Add The token i wanna transfer)... and also there will be transfer fee for 0.001 ERG


[01/03/2022 4:56 AM] tdj#1676
so in the total u need 0.002 ergo to do nft (token) transfer (on mobile wallet, havent tried with yoroi)


[01/03/2022 5:02 AM] tdj#1676
i have tried the yoroi wallet, you can send minimum 0.01 ERG with NFT token, and 0.001 fees

ignore the nft sample above XD , its just sample purpose .. its an nft token i created in the past to fight fakes and stolen arts , .. so i created an auction (it just a warning massage image) exactly besides fake auction, to make sure no one bid on the fake ones

[01/03/2022 5:22 AM] tdj#1676
lastly, on mobile wallet, you can transfer multiple nft token on single transaction (single 0.001 ERG fee )


[01/03/2022 5:23 AM] tdj#1676
but on yoroi, i havent found the option yet to do multiple nft token transfer ... the only another option available is "send all erg and all token option", maybe its underdevelopment

so after not doing my research and getting burned on some stolen nfts, is there  a way to lock said tokens? maybe an address that can keep them from getting recirculated. im just trying to do the right thing here, obviously I could relist them and pass the burden onto the next person but feel its the wrong thing todo.  Maybe a community driven reporting system for addresses who are minting fake nfts called ERGOSLAP? üôÇ


[01/05/2022 2:46 PM] MarantzCube#4825
you can burn them here https://tokenminter.ergo.ga/burn.html

Hello @anon_real On Cardano, it's possible to specify a specific addresses for the royalties, separate from the address receiving the minted NFT? 
Is it also possible to do the same thing with Ergo Auction House?


[01/06/2022 7:40 PM] anon_real#2768
Hey! Yes, not only that, it is possible to receive the royalty in any p2s address!


[01/06/2022 7:40 PM] anon_real#2768
The next version of AH will reflect that.


[01/06/2022 7:40 PM] anon_real#2768
It is already supported technically, only the UI does not reflect that.

i am semi technical and semi art person and not fans of competitive programming person, so i dont know if its logically right ,dynamic, and efficient yet, but so far the code run well .. hoping @anon_real not change so much on AH logic and sites ü§£ since some of it hard-pointing to AH logic and sites  , if so, i must update my code XD


[01/07/2022 8:43 AM] tdj#1676
while playing with ergo api, i have take a look into it, and yes.. it must be dynamic url ... dynamic url is more advance technique but sacrifice convenience rather than static url (i need to connect to ergo api so i can adapt with dynamic url change)  ... i dont know if there any simple workaround for now / to make it static url . since it have connection to dynamic AH logic and connection to dynamic eutxo blockchain that makes auction house site run well.. but i belief @anon_real  can find  simple alternative solution for it in the future to make it more convenient for mass AH users. 

In @anon_real we trust, we belief

[01/07/2022 9:31 AM] maritsaart#9875
Yeah. That issue better to be fixed (into static link). Because one can't promo concrete auction with url in socials or chats.

For now there is workaround with artist address + keywords (artwork title).
Example: 
https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/active?type=picture&artist=9gsiBLZowvDWtZ7wHuWZmv58LFqMfCEW4XepV9AYtr7HofPhFqJ&searchValue=Treasure%20hunters


[01/07/2022 9:58 AM] tdj#1676
nice insight ! .. but current workaround only for active auction .. thats why u said u need  it to be static both active n inactive auction..

 a single static url page of an artist would be nice.. 

ergo galery is being developed.. maybe that feature will be released there (hopefuly) so with just 1 static url (artist address).. contains lots of token insight, token information, past auction information

but it too much for me to develop, let the ergo gallery team develop it üòÅ

In my case the token is not in the wallet


[01/09/2022 10:33 AM] tdj#1676
then your token now have sent to proxy address , the one starts with 4e9YJ5...
in general,  to go live, proxy address should forward to auction address the one starts with 5t19, but now it stucked

@LADOPIXŒ£L 

now i understand why minting address on ergotokens.org is not displaying the artist address for some artist

Yoroi wallet mint token only needs 3 steps fee = 0.001 x 3 = 0.003 ERG
artist wallet address -> token minted -> back to artist wallet (+0.001, with minted token)
in result ergotokens.org api read ARTIST wallet address as minting address

any wallet (mobile) mint token needs 1 additional steps so it needs 4 steps fee = 0.001 x 4 = 0.004 ERG
artist wallet -> proxy contract address -> token minted-> back to artist wallet (+0.001, with minted token)
in result ergotokens.org api read PROXY contract address as minting address


actually its not totally wrong.. but some updates on ergotokens.org api would be nicer to prevent confusion. get/read the first (real first artist address not the proxy address) as the "minting-address", and (if-any) get/read the proxy address as "proxy/issuing-address" else get artist address as issuing address

correct me if im wrong, you can send from multiple different address also, so if you have 10 address, you can send to that one 1 single proxy payment address, when the funds from different 10 addresses receive/reach the expected level proxy payment address needed, you got the token to address the one set in your browser


[01/10/2022 4:52 AM] anon_real#2768
Where the funds come from does not matter. AH considers the wallet you set in UI as your wallet and will send everything to that address.


[01/10/2022 4:52 AM] anon_real#2768
Funds could come from multiple addresses and those can not be relied as the wallet address of user.


[01/10/2022 4:54 AM] anon_real#2768
This is correct.


[01/10/2022 4:57 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
does AH auto attach to yoroi chrome extension, if it is open in another tab?


[01/10/2022 4:58 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
that is only how I can explain that wallet getting attached, if it is one of my wallets (i have many and unfortunately yoroi is being slow)


[01/10/2022 5:01 AM] tdj#1676
if yoroi still slow,  you can restore the secret words (the one on yoroi) to mobile wallet, (yoroi still under development , some times i experience it too , but yoroi getting better and better)...


[01/10/2022 5:06 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Found it. It randomly picked one of my yoroi extension kept wallets.  Funds are there, thank you for your help @anon_real

As a user feedback, something is not right if its picking random wallet if multiple are in yoroi. Should prompt user to confirm which to use.  My .02 cents.

A more efficient UTXO voting
Let‚Äôs say we have a voting contract or a joint-spending contract similar to here. In this setting voters have some specific token that allows them to have a specific ‚Äúvoting power‚Äù. For example, if there are a total of 100 of token x and Alice owns 15 x then she has 15% of the entire voting power.  We‚Äôd like to have an efficient way of voting. V...

Hello, I ask this again, maybe someone can help me eventually. I want to modify the Auction House " 2% of the final bid will go to the Ergo Auction House" into a 5% and also to add a new fee of 5% that would go to another address which I own, or just add a new fee of 5% to another address if it‚Äôs too difficult to do both. I may be able to pay if this kind of change is not expensive, and also I will share it with the community. Thank you üôèüèª

@anon_real hey yesterday due to the auction house problems I was refunded 20 ergs to a wrong address, probably to whatever address I had set at the UI which apparently I do not own anymore, im guessing there s no way to fix that, right?


[01/10/2022 10:23 PM] anon_real#2768
@Daniumy the wallet address you set in the UI is what the smart contracts will send funds to. Everything is controlled by smart contracts so no one can manually change it. Your best shot is to find the wallet your address belongs to.


[01/10/2022 10:23 PM] anon_real#2768
If you are using Yoroi, checkout the first address of your Yoroi nightly


[01/10/2022 10:25 PM] anon_real#2768
And just to clarify, this is not a bug or problem on the AH's side. The wallet you set in the UI is the only way UI knows who you are.


[01/10/2022 10:25 PM] Daniumy#5792
Nope unfortunately I hadnt used the AH in a while and it simply had an old wallet that I do not use anymore neither know the credentials


[01/10/2022 10:26 PM] anon_real#2768
Was it Yoroi or another wallet?


[01/10/2022 10:26 PM] Daniumy#5792
It s fine, learning the hard way! üòé


[01/10/2022 10:26 PM] Daniumy#5792

[01/10/2022 10:27 PM] Daniumy#5792
What happened tho, what was causing problems yesterday?


[01/10/2022 10:27 PM] anon_real#2768
I mean did you send the funds with Yoroi nightly or manually sent to the address AH gives you?


[01/10/2022 10:28 PM] anon_real#2768
There were some problems with the whole network and mempool. Nothing related to the AH really.


[01/10/2022 10:30 PM] Daniumy#5792
Manually


[01/10/2022 10:31 PM] Daniumy#5792
Oh at first I thought it was yoroi's fault


[01/10/2022 10:32 PM] anon_real#2768
I see. I can set a message in the modal that pops up to show the user address that AH is assuming is yours so that people double-check when they send funds.

How the heck do we see nft collections on AH? 
https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/active?type=all
currently there is no "artist/collector page" that can see collection of their NFT, but you can filter ACTIVE auction (yes for now only active auction) by which artist like this: https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/active?type=picture&artist=9iASL5zR9YJHtH32DEnJ6dD5DumVxr3MUZjty1sZuCYFCmSPjEu (its my active nft collection)

if you want to see your owned nft collection, you can click on "owned artworks" on AH



Whats the best way for a normal non-designer to make a buck in AH?
anything can be auctioned on AH, You can auction any token that you think is valuable somehow. Whether it is Artwork NFT, PoW-backed NFTs or it is representing some business shares, etc.


And finally, what are the most popular collections rn?
the OG ones is ergnomes ofcourse, he is the OG, but if you wanna check mine, you can go here https://ergyoroi.com/
but beware of fakes NFTs ... since there are fakes ERGYOROI on the market and some stolen arts like stolen NFTs from other blockchain


Thanks

Yes, if you can please add a confirmation with the minting payment address.

I noticed the day before I minted the work from the wrong address. On the wallet from which I am listing and minting (9gsiBLZowvDWtZ7wHuWZmv58LFqMfCEW4XepV9AYtr7HofPhFqJ) there was small amount on the different address (9iBPjPWpSD4HJe1bMTvZjNiWDDfTXp2sE9zEnd4RdekLoMHzGmF). So by some reason (???) AH minter took ergo not from the first address of the wallet (9gsi...), but from the address with change (9iBP...). 

So I had to
1) redeem the work (Dagger #2) ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I was bid very very near end time ( 70 seconds before end time and it just trigger another auto extend feature by +40 minutes very well) (but i use unix countdown as my guidance)... since the countdown on AH sometimes its unsync with end time (it can be unsync for several minutes, i can say 10-15 minutes before end time on AH countdown is safe time to place bid since on my sight it can be unsync for +- 8 minutes late to unix countdown)... maybe later on @anon_real can take a look at it... goodluck on ergohack III bytheway @anon_real  !

My wallet address did update in AH for 5 minutes, it did showed i was the bidder.  after the auction ended, it reverted back to no bidder.  AH extended the time to additional 40 minutes but that's just visual bug (maybe), I think.   I was watching the explorer and i remembered seeing tx has 2 confirmations (8 minutes) when the auction ended.  This is why I was wondering how long will it take to ensure our bid gets processed.  Thanks for your response and you know what item I was going for.  ü§£


[01/11/2022 2:06 PM] tdj#1676
its so weird then XDD... might be something that happens 1 in a while...

bid gets processed rightaway like in the simulation above... as long as below endtime .. lemme try what will happen to AH n explorer if i bid after the end time..


[01/11/2022 2:13 PM] tdj#1676
HAHA u use the bear, so i know its you


[01/11/2022 2:15 PM] JCFishing2000#1308
I bid 2 items, the other one was like over 10 minutes before auction end.  Both bids got rejected at the end.  So even 10 minutes is not enough time.


[01/11/2022 2:19 PM] tdj#1676
okay lemme try bid 2 items at a time also.. as i know , i must wait transaction to be confirmed first before i can do another transaction


[01/11/2022 2:30 PM] JCFishing2000#1308
I went back and looked into the transaction time, the difference was 7 minutes.  I remembered seeing 1 or 2 confirmation before submitting the 2nd bid. for the item mentioned above.  first transaction was 15 minutes and still failed.


[01/11/2022 2:36 PM] tdj#1676
ah i see.. so its fine then...


[01/11/2022 2:36 PM] tdj#1676
since this what will happen if trying to bid 2 auction at a same time (without waiting confirmed)

in your case, u have waited the first bid to confirm, so its fine then


[01/11/2022 2:40 PM] tdj#1676
btw even in explorer the first bid has not confirmed, the UI already added by 40 minutes extend, and bid already placed


[01/11/2022 2:42 PM] tdj#1676
just now, get notified the bid is placed, and explorer confirmed for the first bid

maybe this explain the one u told u saw the bid extended by 40 minutes, even before transaction confirmed


[01/11/2022 2:44 PM] tdj#1676
now i will try bid after end time


[01/11/2022 2:44 PM] tdj#1676
what will happen


[01/11/2022 2:44 PM] JCFishing2000#1308
I don't know, since all the bids i entered using AH are under 30 minutes gets extension of 40 minutes but is not true extension.  The AH is not user friendly, imo.  hope they make some update soon in the future.


[01/11/2022 2:47 PM] tdj#1676
just now, bid is in the process of being placed after ENDTIME

actually it already passed a few seconds of end time


[01/11/2022 2:47 PM] tdj#1676

yes, i was the bidder for 5 minutes before original auction end time.


[01/11/2022 2:49 PM] tdj#1676
lets see what will happen next


[01/11/2022 2:49 PM] tdj#1676
still waiting


[01/11/2022 2:49 PM] tdj#1676
transaction to confirm


[01/11/2022 2:50 PM] JCFishing2000#1308
I had 2 confirmations when the auction ended.  really not sure how this works anymore. LOL


[01/11/2022 2:51 PM] tdj#1676
i knoww whyy hahahhahahah, i bet soon it will confirm, but no placed bid, it just the ui u saw extended by 40 minutes, auction ends, fund return


[01/11/2022 2:51 PM] tdj#1676
but lets wait for it 1st


[01/11/2022 2:54 PM] tdj#1676

2 confirmation


[01/11/2022 2:57 PM] JCFishing2000#1308
I mentioned earlier the 40 minutes is probably a visual bug.   yep and we have some way to go with the AH process.


[01/11/2022 2:57 PM] tdj#1676
yepp thatss rightt


[01/11/2022 2:57 PM] tdj#1676
2 confirmation only means:


[01/11/2022 2:57 PM] tdj#1676
1 confirmation for your address to proxy address (but proxy address cannot process your fund further because your bid already passed the end time even in the ui countdown still showing 2 minutes left.... but actually in real time, the auction already ended )


[01/11/2022 2:57 PM] tdj#1676
1 another confirmation for the fund to return


[01/11/2022 2:58 PM] JCFishing2000#1308
I'm suprised no one raised this issue with AH.


[01/11/2022 3:02 PM] tdj#1676
NOW THE RESULTTT


[01/11/2022 3:03 PM] tdj#1676
same as what you experienced


[01/11/2022 3:03 PM] tdj#1676
confirmation that your fund forwarded from your address to proxy address

Thank you for bringing this up.  Is there a way for AH to confirm legitimacy of the NFTs?  It will help bidders in the future.


[01/11/2022 3:04 PM] JCFishing2000#1308
They should pay you for testing & improving AH.  Just sayin'


[01/11/2022 3:05 PM] tdj#1676
but proxy address confused , because the bid already passed the end time  so proxy address cannot process your funds further , auction ended with no placed bid

once u place bid after the ENDTIME (on unix countdown, not ah countdown)


[01/11/2022 3:08 PM] tdj#1676
the ui was updated like above  ^^


[01/11/2022 3:09 PM] tdj#1676
its like i placed new bid 0.01 erg, the endtime added 40 minutes


[01/11/2022 3:09 PM] tdj#1676
the bidder because of i use same wallet as seller, so its still the same


[01/11/2022 3:10 PM] tdj#1676
if i used different wallet, it should updated as new bidder... but like u said its all actually UI ONLY, not confirmed yet in blockchain


[01/11/2022 3:11 PM] tdj#1676
but it only happens


[01/11/2022 3:11 PM] tdj#1676
around 1-2 minutes


[01/11/2022 3:11 PM] tdj#1676
for my case


[01/11/2022 3:11 PM] tdj#1676
after that


[01/11/2022 3:11 PM] tdj#1676
the ui changed back


[01/11/2022 3:11 PM] tdj#1676
to 0 minutes again


[01/11/2022 3:11 PM] tdj#1676
then auction ended


[01/11/2022 3:11 PM] JCFishing2000#1308
This sux since I thought I was the bidder for the project (fund was taken out) and after auction ended, they send my fund back.


[01/11/2022 3:12 PM] tdj#1676
ü§£  its all happened just because ui AH countdown still showing 2 minutes left, but actually its already ended


[01/11/2022 3:13 PM] tdj#1676
@anon_real just needs to sync the AH countdown, sometime its not ON-SYNC with realtime UNIX


[01/11/2022 3:13 PM] tdj#1676

Posted this in #‚ùì‚îÇdev-support , but thought I should mention it here too:
When listing an item on AuctionHouse with Yoroi, why is the NFT being sent to some box first (first box does not use additional registers) which is then immediately spent (presumably by AH's node) to create a new box with additional registers? Can we not just circumvent the intermediary box and send the NFT to the final box initially? (The only reason I can think of is because Yoroi dapp connector does not support writing to registers?/  impose fees and royalties)


[01/12/2022 5:05 AM] tdj#1676
correct me if im wrong, in short, probably intermediary box is needed by @anon_real to make AH Logic,Function, and site run well (as u said, impose fees, royalties , any wallet function, process smart contract further, write registers (maybe? ) etc)

for example, when minting token, because im using any wallet, AH need two "additional" intermediary address.. thats why ergotokens read my "additional additional" intermediary address as the minting address instead my wallet

otherwise, if u use yoroi wallet you only need "1 additional intermediary smart contract"  to mint token, ergotokens will show the original artist address as token minter

so its like we only need send our fund to single intermediary address...when the fund reach the intended level of intermediary needed... then the intermediary address will do the rest for us (do some or many logic and function or maybe trigger another intermediary if needed, we dont need to understand the process on-behind we only 1 click send our fund to intermediary then many process run in background, i guess thats why its called 'smart' contract)

and its all recorded on block chain.. not just something happened in client side or server side.. we can see all contract transition on-chain.. i called it the beauty of  EUTXO XD

charles once said alex built ergo in 'developer' way..

The intermediate box has the proxy contract which makes sure the NFT goes to the right auction. This design allows any wallet to start an auction (or any other complex functionality), even if the wallet only supports simple sending/receiving funds.

Yeah ok thanks guys.


[01/12/2022 8:29 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
In the auction house contract, there is a originalIssuanceBox, what method do you use to find this box for an NFT?


[01/12/2022 9:00 AM] KROKODILSHIK#5801
hey guys, any way i can burn nft? it was gif but lagged in browser so i wanna get rid of it now and upload compressed version


[01/12/2022 9:34 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Also was I right in assuming the intermediate boxes are processed by AH node? Is this a potential problem for scaling or can the node handle a lot of volume without too much issue?

Heh. New scam attack. About 50-70% of new NFTs are stolen (as I see on "The last NFTs" https://ergonfts.org/). Just use "binocular" button above each token.

Who are the devs for Auctionhouse? Is there a V3 on the way? We need simple features to be included on there. Like a search bar, gallery view, and Buy Now option.


[01/12/2022 1:15 PM] tdj#1676
Ergo Gallery is under development (but there is still no info how much feature will be developed there, is it become complementary of ergo auction, or rival or else) .. there is auction buy now option in AH v2 (for some auction that specify it)... (btw i am not the devs XD @anon_real  is)


[01/12/2022 1:18 PM] tdj#1676
hmmmm... to be honest i dont know much about running ergo nodes, i need to explore about ergo nodes later.. but as far as i know,  to bypass running node requirement , its running on assembler service,.... you can find assembler service explanation and code here  https://github.com/anon-real/ergo-assembler

Thank you. @anon_real please let‚Äôs get this to compete with other NFT marketplaces with the addition of simple features! Easier said than done, but it will bring so many new people to the ecosystem so artists can be supported even further for their work.


[01/12/2022 1:30 PM] tdj#1676
i hope there will be no other competitor, since too much NFT marketplace, makes me must update my listings to many marketplace, even if there are other competitor, i hope AH can compete with other marketplace and become the number 1 marketplace

Why can't I connect to AH and bid for an item?  been trying to do it for the past 20 minutes.  to be clear, I was able to connect my wallet to AH but not able to bid for the item.

Central banks want to create stablecoins while printing an endless supply of fiat. What's the value of a stablecoin if a reserve is minted without a cap?

#Ergo's SigUSD is a #crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin & $ERG's supply is fixed.

What do you think, #Ergonauts?

They were there before me and had every opportunity to buy.  I think at least 2 people were interested.  I just cannot let Sushi go....if it were something else, maybe or maybe not.  LOL

previous bidder checking in, lmao.


[01/14/2022 1:48 PM] tdj#1676
HAHA! thats why i give you a title 'The Strategist (kinda opportunist) Bidder' on the #009, you are the one who notice auction house very near last minute bid issue

This is it....we help find bugs for auctionhouse. Free of charge..... üòÅ


[01/14/2022 2:05 PM] tdj#1676
for now just a twitter, since i am just an independent nft maker (i am worried i dont have much resource later to manage many things and answering things on discord if any question asked), my focus now is to do art and create more token first (@JCFishing2000 already push me to release more XD) , but its really a nice idea,  surely gonna consider it.. and practicing my english on self-own discord server would be good. (im a slow texter btw, since i must think and translate first XXDD)

for iOS yes, but only because of paperwork (re @DKHamburg87: isn¬¥t that online beta?)

yoroi wallet goes into signing transaction and never returns


[01/18/2022 11:38 PM] Rijadkixi / Pvrisx#5123
Hey guys, how its going?  bought 3 NFTs via Yoroi but only one of them appears in Ergo Auction as Owned Artworks. The last one. The other 2 no.


[01/19/2022 1:22 AM] JCFishing2000#1308
None of my bids went through today.  bid 2 items at least 10 times.  When confirming, 2 exact pop ups come up to enter password and confirm.  did that multiple times and the transactions never hit explorer.  Weirdest part is even UI did not update I'm the bidder eventhough no one else bid on the item.  Maybe this is Yoroi issue or it could be UI.

or node wallet if you are hardcore pc guy


[01/19/2022 4:23 PM] tdj#1676
maybe regular yoroi worth to try... i saw ergo wallet option now available on regular yoroi.. but sometimes regular yoroi can be very slow .. even it tooks a while to open connector... might not work also, but worth to try


[01/19/2022 4:25 PM] tdj#1676
lemme try..


[01/19/2022 4:25 PM] tdj#1676
a sec


[01/19/2022 4:39 PM] tdj#1676
tried with regular yoroi.. it took 2 minutes to open dapp connector


[01/19/2022 4:41 PM] tdj#1676
tried to create new auction, same as what you experienced, after click confirm on dapp connector, it will stuck at loading, forever XD

3. place bid, then copy amount and receiver address
4. go to yoroi (or mobile wallet), then go to "SEND" tab
5. paste exactly amount and receiver address

@ERGkleure i just experience what you experienced in the past... the token stucked in the middle of me and AH for almost an hour.. if you experienced it again.. just use refund feature on AH... but strangely it didnt refund my token (it did show on explorer as unconfirmed refund transaction for just 2-3 seconds) but suddenly it gone and my auction started by itself XXXD


[01/20/2022 2:15 PM] tdj#1676

"any wallet" is another custodial wallet?


[01/20/2022 2:19 PM] tdj#1676
no, it just called any wallet, because it can be used with "any" wallet XD.. yoroi, nightly, mobile, etc in the future

try
1. clear wallet info on AH
2. connect wallet with "any-wallet" option
3. place bid, then copy amount and receiver address
4. go to yoroi (or mobile wallet), then go to "SEND" tab
5. paste exactly amount and receiver address
6. sign tx

[01/20/2022 2:26 PM] tdj#1676
if using mobile wallet, its just as easy as scan qr, select token and send


[01/20/2022 2:26 PM] tdj#1676
if using yoroi.. a bit tricky, because as far as i know, yoroi cannot send token and erg (exact amount of erg) together ...so you must split transaction in two transaction


[01/20/2022 2:26 PM] tdj#1676
3. copy exactly the receiver address, and exactly the amount


[01/20/2022 2:27 PM] tdj#1676
4. go to yoroi, go to "SEND" tab


[01/20/2022 2:30 PM] tdj#1676
5. select token you want to auction, paste receiver address, input 1 qty (because 1 token), sign transaction

[01/20/2022 2:33 PM] tdj#1676
7. wait a while until your transaction is confirmed in blockchain (explorer)


[01/20/2022 2:35 PM] tdj#1676
8.  go to yoroi, go to "SEND" tab again


[01/20/2022 2:36 PM] tdj#1676
9. now paste the amount 0.11 on step 3 (minus 0.01 on step 6).. so in this case 0.1

are there some technical problems currently ? I am trying to mint an nft using yoroi nightly . after pw entry the ergauctions issue window just hangs. also nothing showing up on nightly transaction tab...  tried a few times now...


[01/20/2022 4:12 PM] glasgowm#0000
Issues ongoing with Yoroi yes - can use the instructions above to bid using the normal send


[01/20/2022 4:17 PM] c8e4d2a#0000
https://enft.so/ relies on dapp connector for web3 login, so the whole app is down in this case, not complaining, it's just an info (re @glasgowm: Issues ongoing with Yoroi yes - can use the instructions above to bid using the normal send)


[01/20/2022 5:09 PM] ZeroOne101#0000
i am guessing from the chat that this is a problem with the dapp connector ?  Is there a fix in ? I am curious because isn't the nightly/connector solution temporary ? Is it being fixed or is there a new solution coming ? (re @glasgowm: Issues ongoing with Yoroi yes - can use the instructions above to bid using the normal send)


[01/20/2022 5:10 PM] ZeroOne101#0000
sorry , how does enft.so fit in ? i cant seem to find anything about the site and hadn't heard of it until now ... (re @c8e4d2a: https://enft.so/ relies on dapp connector for web3 login, so the whole app is down in this case, not...)


[01/20/2022 5:11 PM] c8e4d2a#0000
it's a cool story about how dapp connector breaking brings down a whole dapp (re @ZeroOne101: sorry , how does enft.so fit in ? i cant seem to find anything about the site and hadn't heard of it...)

hey guys, apologies if wrong place to ask but what's the deal with the nft marketplace ergo auctions. trying to connect yoroi and it's saying I must install yoroi wallet dapp connector but can't seem to find this anywhere


[01/23/2022 9:23 AM] tdj#1676
its okay #auction-house has been quite lately... u dont need dapp connector anymore... just yoroi nightly is enough.. because dapp connector now already included in  yoroi nightly


[01/23/2022 9:23 AM] tdj#1676
but some people said, yoroi nightly cannot be used lately since update, alternatively you can use any-wallet method

For those who cant bid on AH with YOROI 

try
1. clear wallet info on AH
2. connect wallet with "any-wallet" option
3. place bid, then copy amount and receiver address
4. go to yoroi (or mobile wallet), then go to "SEND" tab
5. paste exactly amount and receiver address
6. sign tx

i've never used it before


[01/23/2022 9:30 AM] tdj#1676
yep, i did, if you have mobile wallet, i suggest you to use mobile wallet.. since its faster (for now)... yoroi sometimes slow and sometimes not working (at least for now) 
sometimes i use yoroi, sometimes i use mobile


[01/23/2022 9:31 AM] tdj#1676
i use them both with the same secret seed

Hi . Why are the transaction totals always so variable at auctions ? auctioning a few today , and most "total" fees were around 1 erg... but lates one wants nearly 6 erg ? I don't get it ...


[01/25/2022 8:08 AM] instrument66#2085
is there a uniform fee for minting ? auctioning ? seems like .001 ERG is the "fee" , but whats up with the wildly fluctuating additional coin requirement ?


[01/25/2022 8:10 AM] instrument66#2085
Also , can someone advise me on how the eff to create a video that loops ? I have been trying mp4s but they display as a blank image , and even after manually selecting playback , they dont loop ... how to get them to display as looping !?


[01/25/2022 8:12 AM] glasgowm#9381
It's just how UTXO works - the signing transaction is the entire balance of that UTXO and you get the change

currently there is no feature to do that (for specific token) in auction house (only GLOBAL past auction you can see)... but if you familiar with ergo api you can find past auction on specific token like i did on https://ergyoroi.com/#ERGYODEX

ERGYOROI - Ergo Collectable NFTs
ERGYOROI are limited hand drawn ERGO NFT, comes from Japanese word The ≈ç-yoroi (Â§ßÈéß) which means great armor.

yeah maybe there is a better way to lay that out in the wallets  ... BTC is also UTXO and it's wallet interfaces never had me posting in chatrooms to figure out whats going on...


[01/25/2022 10:58 AM] tdj#1676
HAHA.. i think they (wallet like yoroi) still focus on functionality rather than being informatve üòÑ one day my friend , one day it will XD

@ERGkleure 
i think i found the possibility why the minted token artist address could be different

my main address: 9iASL...SPjEu
derived address: 9faN2...sMwFn (derived from my main address)

1. i set any-wallet with my main address
2. i mint artwork on AH
3. i send the requested fund from my derived address (since any-wallet feature is that it can be send from multiple/different wallet address, until it reach the requested fund)
4. Token Minted , but AH read my derived address as the artist address instead of my main address that i set in my any-wallet settings

i dont know, maybe it's designed like that .. wdyt @anon_real ? is it run as intended? or it isnt?

@ERGkleure @anon_real 

and my best guess why mobile wallet seems works fine but nautilus isnt is because on mobile you can select "which address / derived address" you want to send from.. in nautilus i think it will just pick the random/latest derived address.. then AH read the derived address as the artist address

The artist's address will be the address that the funds are sent from. My suggestion is to use a wallet with only one address for minting artworks. Or equivalently use a wallet that lets you choose which address to send funds from.

perfect, i dont exactly know the minter details but if it isnt designed like that i belief someone (net-troll) will spam-mint someone address (like they will just set someone address on their any wallet settings to mess up someone nft project)

Yes viewing it on explorer but kinna confuses me haha, I think my problem is I sent funds first and while that got instantly refunded I then send the Nft

So got refunded and maybe I‚Äôm just mistaken but I can‚Äôt seem to find the Nft back in my wallet


[02/01/2022 1:58 AM] tdj#1676
ah i see what you did there... lemme try re-simulate what you did with some dummy.. give a sec


[02/01/2022 2:39 AM] tdj#1676
i got the solution


[02/01/2022 2:40 AM] tdj#1676
there are 2 solution


[02/01/2022 2:41 AM] tdj#1676
wait i must make sure once again


[02/01/2022 2:45 AM] tdj#1676
the first solution is  ( i have tested it) , send a little amount of erg to that proxy address (like just 0.12 erg).. wait a while til blockchain confirm the tx.. after that you can do the refund (both fund+token) @RagonkForce


[02/01/2022 2:47 AM] tdj#1676
the second solution is (i havent test it, but i bet it will work), send EXACTLY 0.109  to that proxy address.. and the auction will up after blockchain confirm the tx


0.109 (its gotten from 0.11 (fund required)-0.001(proxy balance now))

not at all.. whenever u want to split transaction (some wallet like yoroi force you to split tx, it cant sent both token+fund like mobile wallet ), just make sure send the token first .. then send the required fund.. if fund first, auction house will automatically sent the fund back to your wallet in an instant


[02/01/2022 3:04 AM] RagonkForce#7009
Yes i see, will do , good to know

is your problem solved?


[02/01/2022 3:07 AM] RagonkForce#7009
Trying now waiting for confirmations , it has to be like atleast 9? I‚Äôm just switched from yoroi to ergo mobile yesterday so getting used to reading explorer and not getting the low / high confirmations


[02/01/2022 3:08 AM] tdj#1676
nope.. 1 confirm is enough

Hello @anon_real üçª  Does Auction House have a function like  "Owned Artworks" but with a url that you can share with friends to show what NFTS you have in collection ?

Another idea @anon_real  is royalties distribution. I pun a NFT song for sale, and the producer asked me how the royalties work, how the writers, artist, producer, etc. will benefit from royalties sale. Maybe an option to distribute royalties % to different addresses of choice at sale ? ü§î :ergo_orange:

[02/12/2022 9:02 AM] alexandru#0679
Hello, if an auction expires and no bids were made, you have to pay fees to auction the nft again  ? Or it stays on auctions until someone bids  ?


[02/12/2022 9:03 AM] tdj#1676
if time expires and no one bid u have to reauction again and pay 0.1 erg fees, actually the maker could make it 0 fees.. but i believe auction house will be full filled with spammer and tons of fake art if 0 fees

[02/12/2022 8:04 PM] alexandru#0679
also, the amount of image loaded is the same on "owned auction" as if I put it on auction, also ergotokens.org shows the same amount. Tried chrome, brave and edge, same amount of image is shown, that's why I was worried, I thought it was badly uploaded or something.

I want to make a nft. I was looking around in the ergauction and there is some I don't understand. There are very expensive nfts and I can find sometimes the same "pics" that nobody is bidding on. Are these scammer that just copy?

scammers are faster than devs (re @Scheisuss: is there a way to prevent this?)


[02/12/2022 10:46 PM] C4lculista#0000
the standard now is to search for the minting address of your artist and go by that


[02/12/2022 10:46 PM] C4lculista#0000
there is a fake NFT detector, but some scams slip through


[02/12/2022 10:49 PM] Scheisuss#0000
maybe there is  some possibilty to avoid this with creating an instagram account and give there som informatios (still not sure which this would exactly be) so that a copy could be easier to identify?

You shouldn't send money to the seller's address directly

You should place bid by clicking on the bid button


[02/12/2022 11:29 PM] anon_real#2768

that's the address of the auction house

Seller's wallet address


[02/12/2022 11:31 PM] anon_real#2768
So you haven't placed any bids. You've just sent money directly to the seller.


[02/12/2022 11:31 PM] anon_real#2768

Bound to each tier a dice will be rolled of D10. The result of the Dice will determine how much $COMET you get.
Beggar: D10 rewards are the D√ó50.000 $COMET.  So if the result is 7 you get 350.000 $COMET payed out after the sale. 
Common: D10 each D√ó100.000 $COMET. So if result is 5 you get 500.000 $COMET 
Copper: D10 each D√ó250.000 $COMET. So if the result is 8 you get 2.000.000 $COMET

@C4lculista


[02/14/2022 2:20 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Forwarded from Gstoiti: One important difference in practice between using 2 fungible tokens or 2 non-fungible tokens corresponding to the same artwork is the following:
Suppose one of the tokens is sold to Elon Musk and the other one to myself. Then Elon and I both sell our tokens to you. If you then look in your wallet, you would either see one asset with quantity 2 (in the case of fungible tokens) or 2 different assets with quantity 1 each (in the case of nfts). In the first case (fungible), we don't know which one was the token Musk held, whereas in the second case we know which one was Musk's. If you want to resell them, this could be beneficial, since people would probably pay more for a token which Musk held.


[02/14/2022 2:20 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Forwarded from Gstoiti: So nfts allow to track the history of the tokens.


[02/14/2022 2:21 PM] C4lculista#0000
but in this case the NFTs says n/N? (re @Gstoiti: So nfts allow to track the history of the tokens.)


[02/14/2022 2:21 PM] Gstoiti#0000
not necessarily


[02/14/2022 2:21 PM] C4lculista#0000
for example, 3rd NFT out of 12


[02/14/2022 2:21 PM] C4lculista#0000
oh damn (re @Gstoiti: not necessarily)


[02/14/2022 2:21 PM] C4lculista#0000
if it did it could have been identifiable


[02/14/2022 2:23 PM] Gstoiti#0000
if you use nfts (multiple with the same picture) then they are distinguishable, because although the artwork and name may look the same, they have different token ids


[02/14/2022 2:23 PM] Gstoiti#0000
if you use fungible tokens, all have the same token id


[02/14/2022 2:30 PM] C4lculista#0000

Hello @anon_real is there a way to batch-mint NFTs? Attached is an example of how it's done on Cardano. I have 300 NFTs to mint, if it takes 10 minutes for each x 300, it will take 50 hours üòÖ
Subsidiar question: is it possible to mint the NFT without uploading an image to IPFS by specifying in the metadata "image" pointing to an already known IPFS CID (I mean known prior to uploading to IPFS and NFT minting time) and wait to be upload the NFT image to IPFS only once I decide to start to sell the NFTs?

[02/18/2022 12:56 AM] anon_real#2768
Hi,
For your first question, it is a work in progress. But not currently, sorry.
However, it shouldn't take 10 mins to issue one NFT. If you use a wallet that supports unconfirmed txs, like Ergo Wallet Android, then you can issue them one after another without needing to wait for one to be mined.

For the second question, it is possible but reflected in the UI. So practically I would say it is hard to do currently, sorry (

Thanks for the answer! I have no Android phone, does it work also with Yoroi Nightly  dapp Connector? or do you advise to wait until Yoroi or another wallet supports unconfirmed transactions? In general, what are the things to know about the new features coming to decide if it's better to wait until minting?

The problem on mobile for me is how to get the transaction metadata copy pasted on a mobile phone is a little bit non user friendly and prone to errors


[02/18/2022 11:49 AM] tdj#1676
exactly.. i ve been minting since last year XXDDDD manually each 1 by 1, each 'confirmation" by "confirmation" XXDD

Doesn't ErgoPay solve that? (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <UpwindStrategy> The problem on mobile for me is how to get the transaction metadata copy pasted on a mobile phone is a little bit non user friendly and prone to errors)


[02/18/2022 11:56 AM] tdj#1676
1st solution is learn backend code to bulk-mint nft & metadata

2nd solution (which is still prone to errors) copy paste metadata to auction house minter on pc.. then sign the tx with mobile wallet..  its as easy as scan qr on pc screen and sign on mobile

3rd solution.. wait @anon_real / other developers to make easy-bulk nft minter üòÑ


[02/18/2022 2:16 PM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
1) why not with a very well detailed step by step guide
2) That's neat! Yes! Good idea!
3) I waited quite some time already..


[02/18/2022 2:47 PM] tdj#1676
1) agreed with you, in ergo .. there is still lack of well documented guide / tutorial

i personally chosee option 3 .. but until option 3 released.. i create classic hand drawn nft... all did in "classic" way XD .. when it released im gonna have both classic handdrawn nft and generative nft üòâ


[02/18/2022 3:00 PM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
With option 2, do you confirm that I don't have to wait that an asset is minted before doing the next one?


[02/18/2022 3:00 PM] UpwindStrategy - King de Medici#0001
Does option 2 work with a iOS wallet too?


[02/18/2022 3:02 PM] tdj#1676
as anon_real said.. " If you use a wallet that supports unconfirmed txs, like Ergo Wallet Android, then you can issue them one after another without needing to wait for one to be mined." .. maybe rn just android wallet i guess.. soon on ios, since its the same develepor mister stahlfelge

great !! thankyou @anon_real .. cant wait to know how the description is inputted for each token.. is it file upload? or is it lot of many "text input field" ? will you also consider to develop mass auction / mass vending machine sales feature so we can mass-distribute them .. my goal is to mass-distribute them but i dont want to run custom node / rent cloud service to host an appkit to mass distribute them


[02/22/2022 9:00 AM] tdj#1676

noicee..  files method may be easier for hundred/ thousand nfts description/metadata .. perhaps for future development üòÅ


[02/22/2022 9:48 AM] tdj#1676
but my concern of mass auction is.. the auction fees (1000 nfts x 0.1 = 100 erg).. but if lowering the fee.. there will be much2 mass-spammy nfts .. and the auction homepage will be fulfilled with spam and fake art.. like the sort feature will be less usefull.. since users must scroll many times to browse auction house.. to pass the mass-spam and mass-fake art

maybe if like that users wont browse nfts thru the homepage anymore, but rather thru the specific artist link as already AH provided


[02/22/2022 9:52 AM] tdj#1676
but if not lowering the auction fees, mass nft maker will find other way to mass-list / mass-distribute their nfts


[02/22/2022 9:53 AM] tdj#1676
but i want auction house to be #1 marketplaces .. both for hand drawn nfts and generative / mass nfts

Click to see details" wtf... and not possible to delete?


[02/22/2022 11:46 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Auctions are on-chain. There is no possibility to reverse something that happened on a block chain. That's one of the fundamental properties of block chains.
I guess you minted a fungible token (quantity > 1) and not a non fungible token (nft). 
Which video did you watch? Probably was the old video for version 1 of the auction house.
Just try to mint your token again and ask here if anything is unclear. We are happy to help.
Btw you can also dm me for support in German (but I will probably respond in the morning, going to sleep now). (re @Scheisuss: really, how is that possible? i watched the tutorial and the menue is just different from what i see on my screen. Now i started an auction and it says "May not be an artwork

I'm new here and I'm starting a new collection.
ERGOTOYS.

Right now I'm finishing the design and starting the rendering of the first edition.

A series of 3 nfts based on the NAUTILUS wallet.

here's a sneaky peek and my twitter.
I will always inform you about new drops there!

Ergo auctions its worst thing ever


[02/24/2022 9:00 PM] TakeHeart#4224
Would have stayed in the auction for the black Space Farmers helmet MUCH longer and higher, but am personally disappointed at how janky and rudimentary and 'uncertain' the auction interface is. To stress more than this - I am 200% "bullish" (or whatever YES! sentiment) and pro-Ergo and understand this is a work in progress, and cannot wait to see how far it progresses... but man, for something like this to feel as uncertain in its timing and bidding and display and general interface basics, it hurts. Will regroup and reload for another auction at another time to come - and will be working on building photographic NFT's into the ecosystem as well.  LOVE that black helmet design though. Well played...

Yes, bought it (fair and square) to end the auction. And that I understand and respect fully; should have probably just done that myself in this situation. My comment is more on the lines of the mechanics, interface, and steps in place at the time being. Looking forward to the 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 iterations of improvements. Disappointed for now, but will support ERG and help as best I can to keep it going.

Story-bridge "Fabulous gnomes and real life".üòâ
      Good morning everyone. Today I would like to share with you a joyful event that happened in my family. This story is about how the purchase of NFT ERGnome made a difference in my life and the lives of people close to me.
In mid-April 2021, I participated in the auction house https://ergoauctions.org/, the first advertising gnomes were exhibited. I suggested that my wife choose the character she liked from those presented for detention at the auction. The female heart gave preference to "Promo Baby ERGnome". Why was he chosen? only on the occasion that my wife and I wanted to have a baby, for the past 4 years and we did not manage to get pregnant. I had to wait for the auction. After 2 months, we learned that we would be infected! ))
https://ergotoken.org/#/?token=f8153ba996fe626dc45f8cfff5a4c2e3dd79748107357a37c2c4655f050a3ed1
Later, I saw at auction the work of the artist Vaibhav Ganesh and his acquisition of one of the works, which is completely related to this event. Vaibhav mailed, digital copy, minted for me at auction. I want to thank him for his care and attention shown to my family.  
On March 1, 2020, our son was born! Now my wife and child are at home and I close myself well.
I beg you, don't take everything literally in this place!!!
This is the story of a fairy tale! Most between dawn Ergo and the real world.......

How intriguing would be for an NFTs artist to make an exposure in one of the coolest location in the mediterranean?? It would be together with paintings and sculptures


[03/21/2022 12:54 PM] FidgetyRat#9340
Possibly a silly question but I can‚Äôt find info online. When you list an NFT, do you get something for each bid? I‚Äôve noticed very small .009 erg tx come in when bids are made against my NFTs.


[03/21/2022 2:40 PM] tdj#1676
when you list an nft, actually you are bidding yourself nft with 0.009 erg, when someone else lets say X bid 10 erg , AH will send your 0.009 back to you,  then when Y bid 20 erg, AH will send 10 erg back to X, and so on,

you only get 0.009 from the first bid,  the value of final bid (- minus auction fee - minus royalty), and royalty ( if you are the artist )


[03/21/2022 3:29 PM] FidgetyRat#9340
Ah thanks that makes sense.

You know why some people make NFTs and some people collect them?
Cause some of us will just mess stuff up trying to list them. 
I messed this one up pretty good, woops!

ERGnomes 1st Birthday is behind the doors, only 6 days left! ü•≥ @everyone

Very few NFT projects are lucky enough to celebrate their first birthday, and even fewer of them are lucky enough to do so with a genuine community like the ERGnomes one ‚ù§Ô∏è

A few events will be carried out between today and March 31st üòÑ 

We kick things off with a few Birthday PROMO auctions, the first of which is already on the AH: https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/active?type=all&sortKey=5&searchValue=9hX1nJkJu2hcsL2mQmwEtAsJUd94cyryzBFjXYSSzMdn6N87uDR

‚≠ê Every bidder gets a raffle entry
‚≠ê Several physical merch to be raffled: stickers, mugs, posters and more - this will vary depending on the number of bids
‚≠ê Extra raffle entries will be earned by owners of (in ascending order): gnomekins, s2 ERGnomes, s1 ERGnomes, 1/1 Auction House ERGnomes

Buckle up cause this is just the beginning ü•≥

Hello, I was unfortunate/dumb enough to buy a fake Space Farmers pink Nautilus NFT a few days ago on auction house.
It seems the same seller has now put up another fake. Is there some way of blocking that person from selling fake NFTs or is it all down to dd from potential buyers?

sir @anon_real would you mind check AH again, thankyou


[04/08/2022 5:23 PM] Zimulakra#7908
@anon_real  Is there a way to have an address that if you send funds to it, the funds will be equally distributed amongst a pre-defined list of wallets or holders of a specific token?

This could help so that if multiple artists collaborate, the received funds could be automaticly split up. Useful for other things as well.


[04/08/2022 5:25 PM] tdj#1676
you mean like this? @Zimulakra


[04/08/2022 5:29 PM] tdj#1676
and like this   https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/blob/master/eip-0024.md

```However, the proxy contract may inforce the royalty to go to any other complex contract - e.g., 20% to the artrist, 80% to some charity.```

[04/08/2022 5:45 PM] Zimulakra#7908
Ah good to see this. Do you know if it would support more than a two way split? I'd ideally like to be able to have an address that works as a permanant airdrop address

No worries.. What would of happened to minting in that time? I did the usual pay contract with 0.003 etc. Got confirmed but nothing through.

@anon_real Not sure if I should re-do my mints... Does AH refund if it does not complete properly, even though the 0.003 TX's were confirmed on chain? Wondering if I should wait or re-do? Thanks..


[04/12/2022 7:03 PM] anon_real#2768

yo - had an issue with setting up an auction yesterday. Transaction went through NFT's out of my wallet, no auction started. Anything to do?


[04/13/2022 6:00 PM] tdj#1676
is the refund feature working for you?


[04/13/2022 6:18 PM] ERGkleure#7076
For those who use the mobile wallet, the node is giving problems and an error 400 is displayed. To solve it and use the wallet you have to do the following: go to the wallet settings and modify the node. Instead of using the one that comes by default, which seems to be stuck, you have to put this: http://159.65.11.55:9053/

good afternoon guys.

can someone point me to a tutorial on how to insert metadata in my NFTS?

I already have the data structure, but I don't know how to link it to my artwork.


[04/21/2022 6:16 PM] tdj#1676
it just the same as put a description, nothing special,

try these, put it on description
```{

ok.
it doesn't worked.


[04/21/2022 6:36 PM] tdj#1676
try the simpler one, 
```{
  "721": {
    "test1": {
      "name": "test1",
      "description": "desc1",
      "image": "ipfs://QUQUEwXBgcpn959zwWX8YLjNMUeP6ycCx1ANFPyKHNQUQU",
      "edition": 9218379,
      "mediaType": "image/png"
    }
  }
}```

for nested/more complex metadata, just play around with it

Hi, I‚Äôm the one that bought the fake goat. Yes it is my fault for not checking the mint address before buying it, but yet again how is someone supposed to know about that? As someone who just jumped into the Ergo ecosystem and had a look around, everything looked ok. I would have expected that Ergo Auction House will have some sort of system that checks the origin of the NFTs it lists before they do. Sky Harbor does, why would the Ergo Auction won‚Äôt? Yes it‚Äôs a costly mistake I made, and it really left a sour taste in my mouth after purchasing my first ever NFT, I just wanted to support the Ergo Ecosystem and be part of it. Luckily the Ergoats community was nice to me and explained exactly what I did wrong and what to look for in the future. I still believe in Ergo and the Ergoats, I actually purchased my first non fake one yesterday and I will continue to invest in the ecosystem but my first experience was quite unpleasant.

 Hi Dragos sir. This was a costly lesson. Ergo really likes decentralization, that some times means that the user must do some stuff he is not used to


[04/24/2022 1:21 PM] JOFLITO#0000
When you store money on  a bank, they don't let you send over X amount to a new address


[04/24/2022 1:21 PM] JOFLITO#0000
here in Ergo you are the owner of your money, so you need to take some responsabilities


[04/24/2022 1:23 PM] JOFLITO#0000
some apps built on the ergo blockchain will take an approach friendlier to people used to traditional systems like skyHarbor, where they "will protect" the user


[04/24/2022 1:24 PM] JOFLITO#0000
At first is intimidating seeing that amount of fakes on the AH, but once you get more educated you will start seeing the charm of not having gatekeepers


[04/24/2022 1:52 PM] Dragos#0000
Yeah I don‚Äôt know about that. It just seems like the Auction House profits from selling fake NFTs on their platform and it is not in their interest to attempt to fix any of that. The Ergo ecosystem should be about welcoming new people not ripping them off because they have not done extensive research first before using the ecosystem.

 and the 9hq6vnN36GibhacQ76gyTcxkKJyPjhCgk8F9cAJNnvZMNqHE6wC seller tried to "brainwash" you on reddit (but its okay, everyone have rights to have an opinion)... i dont care someone make a reproduction or whatever he/she called it .. its his/her opinion cant  blame them... but when his/her action makes you sad / negative consequences , he/she already commit a crime (its my opinion tho)

 I think his/her intentions are good but I agree, a fake should be just destroyed, me paying 240 Erg on it doesn‚Äôt give it any value.

Guys ,all the artist ,please lets make a Telegram group and whenever we see a fake art popup, we share un group so that we all can make the call together and help the community too , if u want in,let me know


[04/24/2022 2:46 PM] emkolin_pangolin#0000
I‚Äôm really sorry for you spending that amount on a fake. But in my opinion as auction house make also profit on the sells of nfts they have to improve this check before they uploading. As i have discovered that the dont check their nfts they sell i just switched to akyharbor who does. 

U have to understand if you want to grow the ergo ecosystem and have more ¬´¬†customers ¬´¬†/ people using it you have to be also customer friendly. 

I understand that decentralization etc‚Ä¶ want to Not have anyone controling nothing, but this almost not compatible with the growth of a blockchain. You have to control the security otherwise you will have less and less poeple using your platform and rhey will go an other which is more secured.

But i‚Äôm glad thst they working on it and hope they will deploy it quickly to avoid those type of scams.

 i begin with familirize with the tools ,  tbh until now i dont fully understand all the tools , like i just mainly use brush tool

i like to watch tutvid,  PiXimperfect , and Mohamed Achraf, and me only watch on tutorial that i interested in, they are very rich in giving information and shortcuts / tips & trick

at first i start me also cant draw, like i dont understand color , i dont understand shadow and highlight, you can see early ergyorois .. the key is practicing (im not that good either, but me talks like a pro xD)

One report button while the AH  is being developed.
Or even an warning banner.
I just don't get why implement such small stuff first. It seems they don't care since they making profit as well

Hello everyone!
I am currently experimenting with minting some more audio NFTs (and FTs) through the auctionhouse.  I've tried multiple times to mint in various ways but they all have been coming out with play button grayed out.  Upon inspecting the UTF-8 representation it seems the ipfs links are not working.  Anyone know what might be going on?  Is there another way to mint audio NFTs besides auctionhouse. Here are the links to the tokens minted:
1 of 1 NFT:
https://ergotokens.org/#/?token=3768e10434a2a294c46b97c8e2d07e39d43422cfe52734b3c14cb08ed84c9a5f
111 copies FT:

Ergohack project Ergo Nation is looking for an artist to create flyer NFTs for monthly events. Could also be rotating artist every month. 
Could possibly also be sold on marketplaces with royalties for marketing purposes. (All proceeds to the artist. Ergo Nation has no treasury)
Anyone interested?

If I were to do some NFTs of some photography, where would I upload the huge files? Would there be a way to also attach the RAW files to the NFT? Two files, in one NFT?

maybe loosing the `,` would be clearer; but 95 should still be ‚Äô95,00‚Äô right? or does somewhere write it with 3?

 well commas and dots are used differently depending where you live. in skyharbor as we all see 95 ergs are displaying without dots or commas . so how can you be confused ?

well buying nft with a hot wallet that holds more than 100k ergs is not that wise as well. anyway shit happened and it's a shame . i hope the seller if he/she sees the reward the buyer is offering returns this huge amount . if that happened skyharbor and ergosaur should return the fees and get rewards as well imo

 Well in this parts of the world (mostly english metrics), you put a comma after every thousand units, and behind the dots are cents...
For example, 95 millions and 89 cents, in their metrics, it is written 95,000,000.89 !

- refund like 95% of ERG as gentleman's gesture.

Hey @glasgowm  do you need some sigUSD in your wallet to mint an Nft with sigusd as the base currency ?

Token has been minted . But can't send to auction house. 
 The QR code doesn't scan when base currency is sigUSD.

It works and scans perfect when using erg as base currency .


[05/29/2022 4:01 PM] Vaibhav#0000
I do not have sigUSD . Is that the issue ?


[05/29/2022 4:16 PM] glasgowm#0000

These collector NFTs are a start of a collection around Ergo Nation ID verification events. For each event, a rotating organizer gets to design, sell and get royalties on the flyer NFTs. This means we will be adding 10 pieces to the collection every month.


[06/04/2022 7:52 PM] Darkkknight111#0000
The profits go to the rotating artists or event organizers. Ergo Nation itself does not have a treasury.

The first EIP draft of the collection standard and extension of the artwork standard is ready. https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/pull/69
The main goal of this pull request is to introduce collections and extend the existing standard to both support collections and be future-proof and backward compatible.

Here is a summary of what this pull request brings for the ergo NFT ecosystem:
- Introduction of different kinds of traits
- Artist collaboration
- A more robust royalty standard that easily allows multiple royalty recipients with different share percentages
And a lot more for future-proofing the NFT ecosystem on ergo.
Now is the time to collect as much feedback as possible and improve the two EIPs. @Community Developer, artists and others please review and provide feedback. This, in my opinion, is a very important milestone for the future of artworks on ergo.

how many ergnomes exist?


[06/05/2022 12:22 PM] Gstoiti#0000
(re @majstorboob : *how many ergnomes exist?*) 
 
 I don't have an exact number, but I think there are about 1300-1500 Ergnomes.


[06/05/2022 12:23 PM] Gstoiti#0000
@FoeniculumNFTs Do you have an exact number including event and 1 of 1 auction gnomes?


[06/05/2022 12:23 PM] majstorboob#0000
are there new ones being created?

(re @Gstoiti : *@FoeniculumNFTs Do you have an exact number including event and 1 of 1 auction gnomes?*) 
 
 he is on holidays


[06/05/2022 1:17 PM] Gstoiti#0000
(re @majstorboob : *are there new ones being created?*) 
 
 Yes, usually Foeniculum creates some for special events (holidays, ergo events,...), but most of the time those are only 2 or 3 per event. I don't know whether he plans a season 4 drop, but I remember that he once said that there will probably be around 2k Ergnomes at some point.

I need some help and am hoping someone can give me some advice. I sent a bid to the contract address I was given but it never showed I bid, transaction went through and I can verify it's sitting in the address but no luck, attempted to refund bid but it gives me an error to verify funds are still in the contract address

[07/19/2022 4:37 PM] anon_real#2768
@MrStahlfelge is the issue of registers that causes stuck funds still there in the wallet?


[07/19/2022 4:41 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Not in the latest release, but users can still use the older releases.
The tx output has unit registers set so it was done with an older version


[07/19/2022 11:39 PM] anon_real#2768
As of today, do you know any ways to get the funds out of proxy contracts?


[07/20/2022 8:35 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
when costing is fixed


[07/20/2022 2:20 PM] Pioneer#1817
Is there any way of getting these funds back? Its just sitting there....Thanks in advance.


[07/20/2022 4:06 PM] anon_real#2768
Unfortunately, you'll have to wait until V5.0 is released. Reportedly in October.


[07/20/2022 4:07 PM] anon_real#2768
Sorry about that, that is unrelated to the Auction House though, it is caused because of ErgoPay issue setting unit registers.


[07/20/2022 4:21 PM] Pioneer#1817
Will this be something I need to follow up with? Or will it automatically happen. Can you explain what exactly the issues, trying to understand it. Is the issue that the transaction can not be undone, i'm trying to understand this. It seems very scam like that this NFT was posted, purcahsed (a fake) and now the funds are locked in a wallet clearly identifiable.


[07/21/2022 1:27 AM] anon_real#2768
No follow-up is needed. Once V5.0 is activated, your funds can be sent back to your address.
The issue is related to the implementation of ErgoPay protocol in the Mobile wallet. The wallet sets some unnecessary unit registers in the transaction that causes the funds to be stuck in the proxy contract.
In particular, the main issue is with the costing mechanism that Ergo currently has. This is about to be fixed in V5.0 soft-fork. When that happens, your funds can be sent back to you.


[07/21/2022 7:03 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
It has nothing to do with ErgoPay. If auction house would use ErgoPay, everything was safe.
The problem is using the purpose message field with smart contracts.


[07/21/2022 7:04 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Please give the users the actual problem reason so they can avoid further incidents


[07/22/2022 3:30 PM] insano71#9603
So if using the mobile wallet I shouldn't include any payment note? As this is currently causing issues with the smart contract?


[07/22/2022 3:32 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
exactly, the proxy contract gets freezed by the purpose message. that's why we removed the purpose message in the latest wallet app version


[07/22/2022 3:33 PM] insano71#9603
Gotcha, thanks for the information. And just to confirm it sounds like this is being worked on and once the fix is issued stuck funds will be sent back to the original sender? (My sent ergo isn't lost forever I just need to be patient?)


[07/22/2022 3:34 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
the fix is eventually coming. if the proxy contract is called automatically or if you need to do something manually need to be answered by auction house maintainers


[07/22/2022 3:41 PM] insano71#9603

[08/25/2022 3:29 PM] Julizzle#5827
You can use nautilus wallet for ergo auctions right ? I am a bit confused because nautilus is not listed as a wallet to receive custom tokens on the ergoauction website


[08/25/2022 3:40 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
The current version of ergo auction house does not have a dApp connector (edit: last I checked back in April at least haven‚Äôt been on for awhile). So for now you can only use it to send funds from nautilus but not ‚Äúconnect‚Äù to it like current web3 user flow


[08/25/2022 3:56 PM] Julizzle#5827
But I could just use my nautilus address as a receiving address for custom tokens right ?


[08/25/2022 4:11 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
I don‚Äôt see why not - it is just one of many ways to interface with your blockchain wallet/address balance

Thanks


[08/27/2022 8:33 AM] maritsaart#9875
Yeah you can. Just click on "Yoroi wallet" (in AH site) and agree in modal from Nautilus. Maybe it's a hack but it works üòÄ.

nice! so if i'm reading this correctly looks like it's also R5?

hello @anon_real , they told me that I can make a query here for a problem in the auction house. I had an nft minted in my wallet and when creating a new auction it never finished creating and the nft has disappeared from my wallet. I can see that it is in a specific wallet, I leave the transaction here in case you can help me.

Transaction: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/c373c283708f91dc0bbb3bb8c42b34cddd353db6f2875d8538771c39d10b3f59

@anon_real It's not going well to post an auction right? I have tried at least 5 times, I sign the transaction but the transaction does not finish. I don't know if it's an Auction problem, a Nautilus problem, an explorer problem, I don't know. Once I finish signing the transaction, instead of directing me to the transaction number, it directs me to the explorer and I get the last blocks. It certainly isn't working as usual.


[09/20/2022 8:47 PM] AllCyberpunk#7903
I sign the transaction but it never says "Your auction is starting"


[09/20/2022 9:17 PM] AllCyberpunk#7903
Now after many attempts it is working normally. In any case, if you know what the error may be due to, I would like to know it to learn. Thank you!


[09/20/2022 9:17 PM] anon_real#2768
From what you are describing, it seems like a wallet issue


[09/20/2022 9:18 PM] AllCyberpunk#7903
Okay, thank you very much!

@anon_real 
Hello, I have tried to mint 4 nfts but the transactions have been confirmed and the nfts have never reached my wallet.
I have never gotten the "Your artwork is being issued" message in any of the 4 cases.

I leave one of the transactions for you to review and tell me what may have happened. Thank you! https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/fb2dfbf2242e209dbaac2fd9120cf3be7d83c5910b8527ae0c5e0671a652349c


[09/29/2022 10:23 PM] anon_real#2768
Hi, it may be during the time of node update for hard-fork.
Also, blocks are slow, which means we experience mempool congestion probably. So txs may get lost sometimes. I have updated the assembler parameters to more conservative ones to keep track of txs for longer. Hopefully, it won't happen again.


[09/30/2022 7:29 AM] AllCyberpunk#7903
ok, thanks


[10/18/2022 5:18 PM] AllCyberpunk#7903
@anon_real Hi, maybe my query has nothing to do with you, but I don't know who else to consult. I am minting an nft but cloudflare never finishes displaying the image. Can it be a one-off problem or is there a way to fix it? It has happened to me with two nfts (have been minted for more than 4 hours):

[10/18/2022 5:29 PM] anon_real#2768
Hi,
Seems like a cloudflare issue. I could load your uploaded artwork through ipfs.io:

[10/18/2022 5:30 PM] anon_real#2768
That's weird though, not sure why cloudflare is not working in this case only.


[10/18/2022 5:49 PM] AllCyberpunk#7903
Yes, I just saw that right now number 4 is loading, but number 5 is not.


[10/18/2022 5:51 PM] AllCyberpunk#7903
I guess it will fix itself


[10/18/2022 5:52 PM] anon_real#2768

Hi @anon_real , sorry to bother you again, my nft is still not loading the image and I have seen other nfts have been minted from the auction house and the images have not loaded either. Is there anything that can be done?


[10/19/2022 6:45 AM] AllCyberpunk#7903
In any case, is there another way of minting?

Hi @anon_real , I don't know if something has happened to the network or it's my problem. I was minting 8 nfts, all have more than 30 confirmations but none have reached my wallet.

[01/10/2023 5:57 PM] AllCyberpunk#7903
In addition, there is one nft that has been bought instantly and has been frozen

CyberCerberus #8


[01/10/2023 7:54 PM] AllCyberpunk#7903
I have been told by another NFT project that he has not been able to mint either, the nft never arrives to his wallet, I guess it is something generalized and not just my isolated case.


[01/10/2023 8:07 PM] anon_real#2768
Hi, that's weird. Your NFTs weren't minted strangely.


[01/10/2023 8:07 PM] anon_real#2768
Can you try minting one again to see if it is still a problem?


[01/10/2023 8:08 PM] AllCyberpunk#7903
Yes, I'm trying right now. But I know of another person who has had the same problem.


[01/10/2023 8:09 PM] AllCyberpunk#7903
In addition to that, there is one nft that has been bought instantly and has been frozen, you can still see it in the auction

[01/10/2023 8:35 PM] AllCyberpunk#7903
The NFT you asked me to mint now has not reached my wallet either. I suppose that if you have already detected the problem this does not have any influence


[01/10/2023 8:40 PM] anon_real#2768
All should be fine now. Sorry about that.


[01/10/2023 8:41 PM] anon_real#2768
That's a node-specific issue caused by using short int as some ID instead of int. This kicks in every few months. I'm in talk with Kushti to resolve that permanently.


[01/10/2023 8:41 PM] anon_real#2768
Let me know if you have any other issues


[01/10/2023 8:41 PM] anon_real#2768
This also should be okay now


[01/10/2023 8:42 PM] AllCyberpunk#7903
Ok, so the ones I minted, I'll pretend I didn't mint them, right? what I don't want is to duplicate them.


[01/10/2023 8:42 PM] AllCyberpunk#7903
yes, this is already solved


[01/10/2023 8:43 PM] anon_real#2768
yes, I suggest refunding the address you sent some ERGs to to make sure of it


[01/10/2023 8:46 PM] AllCyberpunk#7903
You mean use the refund option? I put the one on the transaction and it says to make sure the funds are in the proxy contract. I guess that means there is nothing there.


[01/10/2023 8:46 PM] AllCyberpunk#7903
ah should I make a payment there?

"Your artwork "CyberKraken #2" is being issued" the auction has already told me this, but not with the others, so I guess it works again

"Error while sending the refund"


[01/10/2023 9:15 PM] AllCyberpunk#7903

Hi @anon_real , sorry to bother you again but I'm getting Auction glitches to upload an auction. I have minted everything fine, but the NFTs go to several wallets and do not end up being published. I have had to use the Refund option several times. It never ends up telling me "Your auction is starting".


[01/12/2023 8:39 PM] AllCyberpunk#7903
I have kept trying it and it does not work.

V3 launch soon?


[02/04/2023 10:32 PM] gLobtrack#0000
Token has lost 75% of it's value in 4 months, and it would probably be worse if not for the scaled unlock. Is there any reason to hold this token at all?


[02/04/2023 10:49 PM] mattam#0000
Did you read the white paper? The reasons are in there. Sell off is due to short term thinking like yours, and stakers trying to get back initial investment.


[02/04/2023 10:49 PM] mattam#0000
Everyone else is waiting for v3 launch


[02/04/2023 10:51 PM] gLobtrack#0000
Great, so as a potential Investor, instead of participating in the seed, I just wait for price to plummet and buy there


[02/04/2023 10:51 PM] gLobtrack#0000
So why use Ergopad at all?


[02/04/2023 10:53 PM] gLobtrack#0000
Market valuation is meaningless the first months, I get it. I am patient. I'm talking objectively about seed round vs waiting for market dump.


[02/04/2023 10:54 PM] mattam#0000
There‚Äôs always a better time to buy in hindsight. That said, a working product closer to IDO would help prevent these types of situations in the future, and a pattern to be aware of as an investor.


[02/04/2023 10:56 PM] gLobtrack#0000
I agree. It's NOT a good look to be currently worth -40% below Staker price

Actually, it is above staker price. Currently, 0.0016480295675447287. Shaker price was $0.015, if memory serves. https://api.ergopad.io/asset/price/aht


[02/05/2023 12:48 AM] mattam#0000
Oh, think the message originally said seed. Yeah, basically at staker price now.


[02/05/2023 12:50 AM] cafebedouin#9837
$0.0015 missed a decimal there.


[02/05/2023 1:41 AM] gLobtrack#0000
Yes, but unlock amount is severely restricted...


[02/05/2023 1:42 AM] gLobtrack#0000
And if you wanted to convert to USD you'd have to convert to ERG and then sell via CEX, so...


[02/05/2023 2:30 AM] cafebedouin#0000
Yeah, because they are vested tokens, and the point of vesting is to give the team time to build their product and not have people cut and run because they don't know how to wait.
