My goal is to get more guides and tooling published for blockchain intelligence analysts. The stuff I‚Äôm doing over at #ergo-watch would probably fall under DevOps here?

i just scanned the ergo intelligence repo. I might be working on a similar project that performs sentiment analysis in a general blockchain sense. I'm building a front-end that utilizes component-driven UI programming models. Basically building components in JavaScript React currently looking to use next.js

[01/03/2022 7:26 PM] glasgowm#9381
Think this is more accurate, hard to measure with staking rewards, etc. Eth doesn't have a supply cap also so their private sales become smaller over time...

Question about side chains: How are these mined & how are txns processed? Are the same miners securing everything as on the ergo network? or is there a separate consensus mechanism?


[01/15/2022 8:35 PM] root7Z#0000
In bitcoin there are separate lightning network nodes that validates transactions off chain (re @TIMRŒ£G7: Question about side chains: How are these mined & how are txns processed? Are the same miners securing everything as on the ergo network? or is there a separate consensus mechanism?)


[01/15/2022 8:36 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
So the side chain would need people running it, similar to the validators on ergodex? (re @root7Z: In bitcoin there are separate lightning network nodes that validates transactions off chain)


[01/15/2022 8:40 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Another question about the soft fork: is there a default vote for miners? In the AMA, Joe said most miners aren't engaging. If someone doesn't do anything, do they just abstain from voting? or is there a default for or against?


[01/15/2022 8:42 PM] root7Z#0000
I think yes I don't know any other design, Matic is using pos validation and arbitrum also uses nodes but maybe there are some other options (re @TIMRŒ£G7: So the side chain would need people running it, similar to the validators on ergodex?)


[01/15/2022 8:42 PM] Armeanio#0000
They vote with hashrate, so if they are mining they are voting. (re @TIMRŒ£G7: Another question about the soft fork: is there a default vote for miners?

[01/15/2022 8:42 PM] Armeanio#0000
Just depends which pool they mine and what that pool is voting for.


[01/15/2022 8:43 PM] Armeanio#0000
Waiting for a few pools to say what they will vote for. So far most are in favor of the fork.


[01/15/2022 8:44 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I see. Your comment on the video reminded me of a psych article I read recently that showed people generally just do what is easiest. For example: Organ Donation. In states/countries that have organ donation as the default, participation is like 90%. In places that have you opt in, participation is like 20%.

For example: Organ Donation. In states/countries that have organ donation as the default, participation is like 90%. In places that have you opt in, participation is like 20%.)


[01/15/2022 8:46 PM] C4lculista#0000
did you see Kushti's post about it a few days ago?


[01/15/2022 8:46 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Yeah I did


[01/15/2022 8:47 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
and I agree, web3 is not all it's cracked up to be. Projects aren't really decentralized and most people are too lazy or uninformed to notice


[01/15/2022 8:49 PM] fruittree#0000
beaker browser is basically web 3 and been active for like 5 years. not very popular if you didnt guess.


[01/15/2022 8:51 PM] fruittree#0000
if the usability gets better and more censorship continues, it could gain more use but it's basically polkadot marketing tactics.


[01/15/2022 8:52 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I hope there becomes some sort of standard that people can measure projects against. Like a BPSAA certification or something.


[01/15/2022 8:52 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
That way people know what decentralization looks like


[01/15/2022 8:53 PM] fruittree#0000
then there also needs to be a reliable anti corruption certification for such decentralization certs.


[01/15/2022 8:54 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Like a dao who's purpose is to weed out centralized chains


[01/15/2022 8:55 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Or at least expose them as such


[01/15/2022 9:00 PM] fruittree#0000
some kind of ranking and review because most will be labeled as aspiring to be etc.


[01/15/2022 9:00 PM] fruittree#0000
maybe if ergopad finishes the DAO toolset soon we can make it happen


[01/15/2022 9:02 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I think that's a good idea. We would need appropriate representation to have our votes mean anything, and a sufficient approval threshold


[01/16/2022 2:51 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Organ harvesting happens while the person's body functions are still working and without anesthesia. Whether the person and/or body experiences pain is an open question. How many people consider that question before ticking a box indicating they'd like to donate organs?


[01/16/2022 2:53 AM] cafebedouin#9837
All of which is irrelevant to your point. But, a point perhaps worth considering anyway. üôÇ

I'd looked into them before but kushti wanted to do a few small ones first. Those hackathons will be better suited once we have pathways complete noobs can get involved easily with. Need lots of mentors, simple tasks to complete, etc. 

I assume anyway, I was always too busy to participate in hackathons so please correct me here if I'm wrong.

This is an issue of the window size :/ new behavior after the UI update. On desktop if you resize the window you will see the boxes snap to edges and stretch the images


[01/27/2022 6:20 PM] NoahErgo#4349
I dont know how to eliminate this stretching behavior, i would prefer static boxes that multiply as there is more space on the window


[01/27/2022 6:38 PM] Œ£otiris#3516
what if you set the max-height to fit-content  in the element style? also the images should probably be uploaded in the same resolution/aspect ratio

hackathon should bring some interesting stuff. Not sure how best to promote these events to outsiders though - or recruiting devs as most dev spaces seem hostile to blockchain.

These Events could be promoted by focusing on the benefits for those who participate/view them. This could be split into two main strategies. The one being to talk about what would one learn during the Event and the other incentives ( like nfts, rewards, public relations, etc.) Most people use Twitter/Reddit/YouTube/Medium to get to learn about crypto, so small videos/banners/articles should be spread amongst platforms to increase awareness. The best part about Ergo is the more you dive in, the more you like it. And this is mostly due to its principles and community.


[02/07/2022 1:43 PM] glasgowm#9381

some fair comments on price, some fair comments on fundamentals. then the usual CC bs comments. have to take the good with the bad. looking at the charts its not flash at all, this is all while we have seen incredible ecosystem and development growth. surely this value will be reflected in price at some point

[02/17/2022 7:57 AM] NoahErgo#4349
@Œ£otiris

Bout to dump a mega wall of text about sigmaverse cause i have been way too busy with work recently to really do much with it and I have been super appreciative of your updates.

I keep a running list of future projects to add to Sigmaverse when they are ready enough. Generally my rule of thumb is that they should have a useable webpage that has at least a minimum amount of functionality or even if it doesn't there is enough info there so as to not confuse people into bugs or something. And then I also will keep tabs on projects that might be queued to get a website in the future but maybe they dont have one yet or are inactive but maybe will return in future. A lot of times I will dm devs on github or twitter, etc. to see what their future plans are to get a sense of this. Exceptions can be made for projects on github such as ErgoVision or ZK treasury that dont have a frontend built out. I feel like adding something like a twitter page is a bad precedent because there are so many twitter NFT projects out there and it makes the barrier to entry a bit too low IMO.

Also in the future I think it might be good to add a tab for wallets as more become available (satergo, nautilus, safew, minotaur, anetabtc wallet, ergo mobile wallet, etc.)


[02/17/2022 7:58 AM] NoahErgo#4349
-------------

Here is a running list of projects not ready for upload:

https://enft.so/ - currently in closed beta and not really useable. I told devs i would add them in the future
https://paideia.im/ - not yet developed
https://www.ergolend.org/ - frontend mockup is just placeholder, dev is still ongoing and i told devs ill add in future
https://www.sigmastamp.ml/ - really slow progress on this one but slowly getting there ( was part of first ergohack), I have tried to use it but so far i still dont think its functional
https://satergo.com/ - dev still in progress, current available build has some issues so not ready for sigmaverse yet
https://www.deepchainada.com/ - deep learning cross chain ada and ergo, nothing built yet and still too early
https://twitter.com/shmpcoin - shrimpcoin, projects is apparently not dead but havent seen anything new in many months
https://twitter.com/ErgoPay - Just dmed this guy, says he is building some kind of payment gateway in the future
https://twitter.com/fruity_saguaros - Very active NFT project, in dms says he is building a website soon.
https://github.com/minotaur-ergo/minotaur-wallet - minotaur wallet, nothing to see aside from github but their checklist is near completion

New ergohack projects:
https://www.skyharbor.io/ - nft marketplace
https://github.com/GuapSwap/guapswap - miner asset swap tool
https://delphiproject.org/ - oracle platform
https://github.com/nightowlcasino - casino
https://github.com/hypo10use/quid-games - hype10use quid games
https://github.com/ergonames - ergonames

[02/17/2022 7:58 AM] NoahErgo#4349
-------------

Here is a list of projects that I think we could add in next round of additions:

Wallets:
https://github.com/ThierryM1212/SAFEW - many users already using this, maybe we get a screenshot of the wallet UI
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nautilus-wallet/gjlmehlldlphhljhpnlddaodbjjcchai - Nautilus wallet, needs no explanation
https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-wallet-app - ergo mobile wallets
https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/ - Yoroi, blech but probably best to include if we do in fact add a wallet tab
https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Set-up-a-full-node - ergo node wallet

https://www.blitz-tcg.com/ - Dapp game not developed yet but good art assets, whitepaper is there, etc.
https://www.eternaeon.io/ - Darkpool game confirmed to be an ergopad IDO
https://golfgl.de/ergopayshowcase/#mint-token - Ergopay showcase, use to mint and burn tokens using mobile wallet (mostly a dev showcase but still functional - can mint tokens with emojis in the name lol)
https://8bits.at/ - minigame showcasing ergo ecosystem
https://ergkleure.com/ - NFT project with great abstract artwork
https://ergoitaly.it/ - Italian community site for Ergo
https://share.streamlit.io/eeysirhc/ergodex-price-app/main - ergodex price index viewer

I have also considered adding mining tools to the tooling section as well referencing this list, but it is probably out of date and maybe it isn't the place for it: https://www.reddit.com/r/erg_miners/comments/njmlfq/list_of_currently_used_miners_for_ergo_with/


[02/17/2022 9:04 AM] Œ£otiris#3516
Thank you too, really appreciate it. My vie on these are the same as yours. I see sigmaverse as the point of reference when someone wants to find out about dapps and projects that are developed. Having said that, Twitter pages would set a really low standard just like you said, as anyone can create one with actually nothing. The wallets are a vital part of the ecosystem and I would personally like if they were added using a new tab. As for the ZK Treasury and Projects that don't have a front end it would be useful if we created a page with a summary ( copy/paste probably) from the readme. On first click someone would get an extended summary with info and then there would be external links. This would also create a space where anyone with a project like that, could have a landing page of his project. That could also be used for all projects . Also with the development of more and more dapps there might be needed to alter the ui to make it more clean, have a featured/popular or newest tab or section shocasing some projects and then having tabs. Just some ideas that imo could help.


[02/17/2022 9:17 AM] NoahErgo#4349
Interesting idea, where would this landing page be hosted?


[02/17/2022 9:20 AM] NoahErgo#4349
Btw this will be future style of sigmaverse to match future website

I looked into that typeform integration for github PRs and to get it working i would have to pay for an upgraded typeform license


[02/24/2022 7:40 AM] Œ£otiris#3516
I think there are 2 solutions to this that may be better than being dependent on a 3rd party.
One would be to create a video showcasing the steps of submitting a new project in a simple way that one with no prior knowledge would be able to understand.
The second one would be to create a form on the website that would get the info/images needed and then after reviewing it we could submit them.
I think there are plans to implement a cms so this would become even easier.
Just thinking out loud.


[02/24/2022 8:03 AM] NoahErgo#4349
Yeah these options seem better I think


[02/24/2022 9:21 AM] glasgowm#9381
We're already paying for one


[02/24/2022 9:23 AM] NoahErgo#4349
Good to know! Although sounds like dmitry may have other plans already but good backup option


[02/24/2022 9:28 AM] NoahErgo#4349

Spent a bit of time on Twitter yesterday, started filling in a Twitter Strategy page on Notion. Plan to do one for each social. Twitter is a bit out my comfort zone so additions from the pro's would be appreciated @JŒµnniŒµ D @CW @Vierolean @Chris Ray + anyone else I've forgot üôÇ @SigCan 

https://www.notion.so/Twitter-Strategy-437583995e5841edb493bac879a3e12d

My current thinking (following on from the DAO discussions) is this could be shaped into a service. So a `GrowthDAO` or `MarketingDAO` that the EF/ecosystem projects could hire to help grow erg/their projects. The incentives structure itself is a bit hazy to me and will probably grow with our activity but I have a few ideas I'll load onto Notion. 

Seems ergo-teams will have a CLI version next week? or we could get stuck right in if we have 3 @Sigmanauts who want to run a node / host a ZKT. 

Also note that we have a handful of professional marketers in our ranks so if anyone has availability to work hours or has any sort of proposal let me or @AngieHar know as the people who apply for these roles usually end up being mince.

[02/25/2022 10:43 AM] glasgowm#9381
Reddit is a lot harder to penetrate, but better when you do. I might just need to learn how to use Twitter better though. Finding good content to latch onto is hard as the Latest tab is just completely flooded with spam, no filtering by follower count or anything. Most of their data is a black-box, can get like 1% publicly, 10% with permission and anything above only if you're in govt lol

Assuming market conditions remain the same and my math is correct then the soft fork emission schedule would hit the static $71 approx 270 days earlier which is about 9 months (re: https://twitter.com/Haskell_plus/status/1503116738405154817?s=20&t=FURHb2IzWfccY4ClHXcIwQ )

I don't know who needs to hear this:

Currently block reward for #Ergo miners is 66 $ERG per block mined, that is approx. $154,440 a day
In about 5 years block reward will be 3 $ERG per block mined, to maintain $154,440 a day in rewards that brings the price of $ERG to $71.5 üêÇ

Hey guys, I have an idea for the graphic designers. @NoahErgo  is doing an amazing job keeping sigmaverse up to date. 

Can we expand on that and create an ecosystem map of all the projects icons?

Another idea could be to see the ecosystem growth over time, using GitHub timestamps for when projects were added to sigmaverse. Say, starting when noah took the initiative we start there. Then group the projects added over say 2 months, then again and so on. 

Could be a good visualisation/infographic for the growth if the ecosystem over the passed 12 months or so

I like to reference that BlakeClass lottery post anytime people do not understand the need for privacy. People like to ask about lambos. I've never seen anyone talk about what tends to happen to people driving around in one. I'd guess finding yourself with a lot of money because of crypto will end in much the same as lottery winners. https://www.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/comments/tu1eh3/comment/i34eu0t/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

The utxo alliance chat is untapped potential guys, how can we make the most of it? There are top level devs from nervos and alephium in there. This morning the founder of alephium joined and he is big on ergo too


[04/21/2022 3:38 PM] glasgowm#9381
dev-resources are the main stretch for most places, but hopefully we can link up via Rosen (and other ways) soon. Stuff like podcasts/youtube/etc would be good


[04/21/2022 3:41 PM] NoahErgo#4349
Yeah at the moment everyone is so focused on building their own stuff


[04/21/2022 3:42 PM] glasgowm#9381
as soon we get a decent bridge we can do a lot more stuff just with wrapped tokens even


[04/21/2022 3:42 PM] glasgowm#9381
but talks about privacy/security/crypto fundamentals would go down well I think


[04/21/2022 3:43 PM] glasgowm#9381
should maybe categorise each ones strengths and where we can lean on each other - I only have a surface level knowledge of most

Have Armeanio/Dan ever expressed interest in speaking to content creators to help market Ergo? I'm curious where they stand on this. I.e. Charles Hoskinson turns down interviews with channels that speculate on price, but will speak with people who have genuine curiosity about the tech.


[05/26/2022 5:46 PM] dann#0000
I doubt anybody from the Ergo team would reject having a chat with any content creator interested in a talk about tech


[05/26/2022 5:49 PM] glasgowm#9381
No issues with content creators; Armeanios been on a few already (Ryan Matta, Son of Tech recently). Issue is most of the popular ones are way overpriced,  but any high-quality channels that want to do them for free have always been pursued.

@T U L O (ErgoMinnow) I really enjoyed the read!


[06/24/2022 1:30 AM] Sisyphuspush#7967
My 2 cents, if you find it worth adding...One of the strongest arguments for Ergo is the community and the ethos which unite them...those 1st principles...and how that drives innovation within the community. I think there is room to show that in some of the areas you mentioned.

on the flip side, organised messaging, tweets, infographics on a single topic on the pros/cons of ergo is great. pick a subject, spin up some hype

[06/30/2022 8:26 PM] JOFLITO#0000
and now it means locking and getting rewards for it


[06/30/2022 8:27 PM] JOFLITO#0000
how about we degenerate the meaning of mining?


[06/30/2022 8:27 PM] JOFLITO#0000
what if we say "mine ergo without a GPU (as a millionaire)"


[06/30/2022 8:27 PM] JOFLITO#0000
and instead of mining is an offchain bot tutorial


[06/30/2022 8:29 PM] JOFLITO#0000
and then people make comments saying how we are dumb, and vote it down, and some others saying we are geniuses and asking about raspberry pis. youtube algorithm would love it

Just throwing a suggestion out there


[07/21/2022 3:53 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
What if you guys took small important clips from the AMAs and uploaded to an official ergoplatform tiktok?


[07/21/2022 3:53 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I think that would be quite helpful in reaching new people.


[07/22/2022 5:37 PM] NoahErgo#4349
@T U L O (ErgoMinnow) would you like to run it?


[07/22/2022 5:37 PM] NoahErgo#4349
i think you are by far the most versed in tiktok of everyone in the community


[07/22/2022 5:37 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I dont think I have the time right now due to writing/editing articles and launching Ergo Champions NFT project soon. I could after the NFT launch?


[07/22/2022 5:38 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I could probably take it on in the future.


[07/22/2022 5:38 PM] NoahErgo#4349
makes sense


[07/22/2022 5:38 PM] NoahErgo#4349
dont stretch yourself thin haha


[07/22/2022 5:38 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
yeah for sure


[07/22/2022 5:38 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I think the tiktok thing would be really easy to be fair though.


[07/22/2022 5:38 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
If somone is willing to find and cut the clips from AMAs etc


[07/22/2022 5:38 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
u just literally upload it from there


[07/22/2022 5:38 PM] NoahErgo#4349
seems like something that might be more effective during bull market anyway since tiktok is such a shortlived media form


[07/22/2022 5:39 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
It would definitely be more effective during a bull market but I think has value even right now.


[07/22/2022 5:39 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Its a low effort thing for more exposure imo.


[07/22/2022 5:39 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
but it would take someone finding and cutting the ama clips which would take some work.


[07/22/2022 5:40 PM] NoahErgo#4349

@NoahErgo I‚Äôm a bit more free now, I‚Äôm thinking I could probably help with the tiktok idea. What I‚Äôm thinking as well is we could rely on the community to send cool clips from AMAs/YouTube videos etc and I can just easily upload from there.


[07/31/2022 1:35 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I genuinely think this is an extremely underrated way to gain more exposure for Ergo and its free which is great.


[07/31/2022 1:35 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Crypto is pretty big on tiktok as well


[07/31/2022 3:13 PM] NoahErgo#0000

[07/31/2022 8:18 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385

Today I connected a guy who is good with ergoscript with a project manager who has been seeking a dev for a while (he backed out of ergohack fest due to the original dev backing out). Should be interesting they have some big plans for a protocol owned liquidity platform that will be tokenless

Just put community-run in the description otherwise we'll get people moaning. Might be good adding a bit to the manifesto to help clarify things


[08/01/2022 1:38 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Yeah good call. Also, what do you mean it might be good adding a bit to the manifesto?


[08/01/2022 1:48 AM] glasgowm#9381
The distinction between the EF / Ergo / Community - not sure it's described anywhere currently.


[08/01/2022 1:51 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
So a disclaimer like ‚ÄúThis account is run by the Ergo community members and not the Ergo team‚Äù?


[08/01/2022 1:53 AM] glasgowm#9381
'Community-run' like the insta should be fine. There is no real official 'ergo' team (which is the bit we should probably clarify in the manifesto)


[08/01/2022 2:22 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Ah okay


[08/01/2022 2:22 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Tbh even I‚Äôm confused with that


[08/01/2022 2:22 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I always thought the Ergo Foundation was synonymous with the Ergo Team


[08/01/2022 2:37 AM] glasgowm#9381
Nop the foundation is just a way to manage the treasury to push forward ergo. It pays devs, offers bounties, grants, etc. But if EF funding was the criterion for 'Ergo team' then loads of ecosystem projects / community devs would qualify. Similarly people working on the core could be salaried, rewarded, redeeming bounties, or just contributing for fun. The EF is community-ran too which makes things extra confusing; will write something up when I'm back.


[08/01/2022 2:50 AM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Interesting üëÄ thanks for the clarification. Yeah this is definitely a misconception that a lot of the ergo community has I think haha


[08/01/2022 7:46 AM] NoahErgo#4349

I know Ergo is separate from that and is an amazing protocol, but sometimes you need a little sex appeal to bring in some more eyeballs. I hope it helps lol.

Hey everyone! Good morning!  I was thinking about building a ErgoplatfomIta page on tweeter. Maybe this can be a good strategy to gather more italian people. Because the Ergoitaly account it's not getting much attention. Maybe an official looking account can make the extra half mile we need! What you guys think?


[09/01/2022 1:22 PM] hq3r#5569
you were looking for some way to collect all ergo related videos few months back , i can make a video portal for it and have things more organized if you want

 All videos will be hiperlinked to YouTube , just a main page to have all content in one screen,not uploading

Amazing mate. Is this a framework you've found or what?

Yeah this is a good idea if you're willing to tweet. Think the spanish community have one too

 I used to run movies website in past and use a CMS which has easy backend and easy frontend to modify and adapt, "datalife engine " is the name of it, I can setup and run a website in minutes with it

nice one, never heard of it. More of a plex guy üòõ


[09/01/2022 2:23 PM] glasgowm#9381
Can you link YT to this though? or have to rehost?


[09/01/2022 2:24 PM] hq3r#5569
we can do it like sigmaverse, hyperlink it , user click on it and goes to youtube or we can generate external page with iframe of video and let people comment and stuff on it


[09/01/2022 2:24 PM] hq3r#5569
polls can be added, mp3 players for podcast and stuff like that


[09/01/2022 2:25 PM] glasgowm#9381
sounds good


[09/01/2022 2:27 PM] hq3r#5569
should i waste my time on it then ? üòÑ


[09/01/2022 2:27 PM] glasgowm#9381
Maybe @AngieHar has some spreadsheets saved with youtube links about ergo she could share to save time.


[09/01/2022 2:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah think it'd be a good resource, would make a good raffle too


[09/01/2022 2:38 PM] hq3r#5569
will write down and showcase all the features i want to add and present it in better conditions


[09/01/2022 2:39 PM] hq3r#5569
raffle stuff isnt my thing , if you can make it happen and it pays for the anual cost of hosting and stuff, less stress on me

 Hey, Can you help us in making ergo nft website ( which has all the information of nft projects and artists like sigmaverse ). Me and @sisyphuspush was thinking of this from quite few weeks.

 Don't We have already have skyharbour for that ?


[09/01/2022 8:08 PM] Darkkknight111#0000
O you want a web without smart contracts, just a web 2.0 portal where you showcase the artists?

 Yup ! And we will think to add more features to this website in future.


[09/01/2022 8:22 PM] Ergonautt#0000
We have ergo nft group in discord which is made to promote new artists and nft projects in ergo ecosystem. So we are thinking of making a website too

I had started a basic website several weeks ago before I got sick. Its a basic one using MyWebsiteNow, but I plan on picking it back up again shortly since Ive been getting better.


[09/03/2022 4:01 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
I had chatted w/ @Rishabh about helping out with it when I get started again. Maybe we can all get together and see if we can come up with something interesting.

can you forward me all dapp small logo you have on sigmaverse please , no rush

oh this is not so easy to do haha


[09/09/2022 4:25 PM] NoahErgo#4349
I would recommend downloading the sigmaverse github repo instead


[09/09/2022 4:25 PM] NoahErgo#4349
i will take a look at this


[09/09/2022 4:26 PM] NoahErgo#4349
to be honest I don't quite understand what the use case for this is


[09/09/2022 4:43 PM] NoahErgo#4349
but might be worth discussing with them as some may find this useful


[09/09/2022 4:49 PM] koutelier#0000
(re  : *<Noah> to be honest I don't quite understand what the use case for this is*) 
 
 well i take a quick look. it appears that it's something like (our) ilya wanted to do few months ago. host your node platform .


[09/09/2022 4:50 PM] koutelier#0000
i can see one big perk of collab with them . more nodes = more secure network. because they give % of the fees to the users that host their node there .


[09/09/2022 4:50 PM] koutelier#0000
the real question is are we benefit from this or they are ?


[09/09/2022 4:50 PM] koutelier#0000
also the fees would be in erg or erg tokens or in their token/coin ?


[09/09/2022 5:40 PM] Darkkknight111#0000
what options would you guys recommend to add on the secondry page for the dapp, already did add some options

(re @NoahErgo : *I am biased but dont we have sigmaverse for this?*) 
 
 Not trying to take sigmaverse place si .... Just placing the "most used" stuff, knowing  that it's going to be a portal for information... 
In that case I should not add blogs,podcasts and nfts either 
Just a specific part of ecosystem and there will be a link on top " check all dapps @ sigmaverse


[09/09/2022 6:31 PM] Darkkknight111#0000
Not trying to replace anyone , just trying to gather all of the ecosystem in one place

I will not be jumping on the $Ergo wagon post-Eth. 

Why?

Read On.

Ergo is toted as an energy saving algo that will "hopefully" give similar profitability to former $eth miners while using less power. 

However I've noted some issues with this algo that >>
