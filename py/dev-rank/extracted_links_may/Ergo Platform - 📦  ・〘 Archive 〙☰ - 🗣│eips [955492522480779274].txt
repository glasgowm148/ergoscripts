==============================================================

[03/22/2022 2:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
New channel, for discussions around EIPs

Currently, we need discussions around how best to prevent spam/scams from flooding the ecosystem

@MrStahlfelge has started EIP-0021
https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/blob/master/eip-0021.md

@Armeanio opened this issue yesterday after confusion/fear on ergodex custom pool launch
https://github.com/ergolabs/ergo-dex-asset-icons/issues/3

Question is - who is the authority on 'verifying' tokens or deeming them suspicious/blocked.

I hear some rumblings in the mining community about the difficulty adjustment mechanism. What would it take to change the adjustment from 8 epochs to 1 epoch. Ideally it would be cool if difficulty adjusted every block but i guess reducing it to 1 would be the easiest to implement?

would be great to use EIP-29 in R9. this way, different formats could be use there and existing code to parse the register be reused


[05/10/2022 6:18 PM] nitram147#5106
> cool, thanks. we should move to üó£‚îÇeips  and ‚ùì‚îÇdev-support . for the encryption, someone else than me should check if this introduces any security issues. I like the idea of using the actual secret a lot, but I can't judge if this leaks any information of the secret which would be a major issue. so best is to start a discussion in üó£‚îÇeips
@MrStahlfelge  of course I would like to hear a feedback from others and see somebody reviews the proposed cryptography. I'm assuming that you probably don't have a cryptography background so just a little explanation of the properties:


[05/10/2022 6:18 PM] nitram147#5106
The operation my EIP use for the calculation of the ``shared_secret`` is literally same operation as the operation for the derivation of public key from the private key. The operation (ECC point multiplication) is irreversible thus safe (assuming that the finding of discrete logarithm over the eliptic curve group is a hard operation). If somebody will be able to easily deduce private key from the ``shared_secret`` it would mean that with his special algorithm he would be also capable of finding a private key to any public key (any ergo P2PK) address. To the part that when somebody knows the ``encryption_key`` for one message, he isn't able to decrypt any other past or future messages, this is simply the implication of preimage resistance property of the Blake2b256 hash function.

[06/03/2022 5:07 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Hey there, who should I reach out to for adding 3d models to EIP 0004- Assets standard?
I would propose the following structure:
R7: 0e020104 (04 for 3d models)
R8: Hash of 3d model file
R9(optional): (3d model link, cover image link) - similar to audio files 3d models should have cover images


[06/03/2022 8:33 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
you reach out by doing a PR on the eip repository üôÇ
and then link here and in development chat / weekly for discussion requests. always good to ping others as well as there are already some change proposals for eip4


[06/03/2022 8:35 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
that said, I would change r9 to use the attachments format we have in eip-29. it was not present when eip4 was made, but new additions should use it to make implementations easier.
and maybe we should simply introduce the mime file type classifier so that we don't need to change eip4 for every file type out there?


[06/03/2022 9:10 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
Ah yeah sure, will do. Although I don't see any PR's directly relating to eip4 currently so not sure who would currently be involved in the discussion.

Good idea, approved the PR


[06/05/2022 7:40 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
This removes a potential path for miner profitability when claiming low value utxos for storage rent. It also ensures that valuable tokens left in dead addresses are unable to reap some of the benefits of Ergo's storage rent mechanism. Is there anyway to reconcile these problems with this EIP?


[06/07/2022 1:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
I don't think burning value is wise/efficient. Could it be placed in a box only redeemable by an address generated by the same private key? Or in a DAO who could opt to burn any tokens which pose a security risk before it was passed back to the miners.


[06/07/2022 2:21 PM] nitram147#5106
@Cheese Enthusiast @glasgowm Simplest solution (however not applicable right now) would be to indicate via token standard whether is this token some "security" token or not, if so, then it MUST be burned when garbage collecting boxes... However in order to make this approach to working it would be needed to enforce this behavior via consensus rules which would imply need for chain forking - and it also did not solve the problem with already existing tokens.


[06/07/2022 2:23 PM] glasgowm#9381
Why would it need to be consensus vs a DAO?


[06/07/2022 2:31 PM] nitram147#5106
If it's enforced via consensus rules it's guaranteed to hold true, in case of DAO the solution isn't 100% trustless - nobody can be sure that DAO voting isn't composed of actors with bad incetives


[06/07/2022 3:06 PM] glasgowm#9381
Not sure it needs that level of trust, but you could make the voting token ERG with some added function to reduce whale-powers and/or tokens with known risks be burned individually via SFs.

It's a good question.

It hasn't happened yet, but it could happen if miners desired it. Avoiding it is advantageous.

it is now being updated 
I am updating to 4.0.103
And removed the vote {} section
is that all that is needed? 
Do I still need this section for 4.0.103 version `wallet {
    checkEIP27 = true
  }

That's the question from Leafpool if anyone can help answer. I told them to leave the EIP27 section unchanged please correct me if I'm wrong .
