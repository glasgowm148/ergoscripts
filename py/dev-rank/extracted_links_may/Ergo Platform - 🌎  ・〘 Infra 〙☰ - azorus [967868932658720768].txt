Azorus whitepaper: https://github.com/gsblabsio/azorus
We have an IDO with ErgoPad: https://ergopad.io/projects/azorus

ErgoHack Fest objective: "show, don't tell" is our philosophy so rather than wait around we thought it best to jump start the project by building a simple prototype for the hackathon! üòÑ


[05/09/2022 1:37 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0000
[thread]: Hey guys I read your whitepaper. I have a few questions about what Azorus is and your initial plans.

- Is Azorus centralized, decentralized, or a hybrid approach. If it is centralized, will you move towards a decentralized model over time? If decentralized, how do you reconcile the usage of large calculations and data sets on the blockchain. Seems tough considering how slow and inefficient blockchains tend to be.

- What is the utility of the data you will be serving? I see some mentions of trading bots, price calculations, etc that might be interesting. Are there any other use cases?

- Who are your main customers? Are there any companies / projects you see on the Ergo blockchain right now that could benefit from Azorus?

- How do you deal with problems such as desyncing of nodes which could provide bad / old data? How do you deal with data providers being potential bad actors?

- I didn't quite understand what a MOOC is. Do you mind explaining that again and how it is relevant to Azorus?

-  Useful Proof-of-Work is claimed by many but implementations I've seen are usually lacking(ex. Offchain bots are great for carrying out transactions, but usually lack a consensus, so the fastest bot will usually "win"). Generally, part of the security of PoW is that the work is both hard to do and useless in any context outside of the blockchain. So what is meant here by UPoW, and how do you plan on implementing it?

- You mention nodes a few times. Are you referring to Ergo nodes, or nodes specifically designed to interface with Azorus ?

- What type of L2 solution do you think Azorus would work best with in the future?

No need to have an answer for all the questions, I imagine some will be easier to answer in the future.


[05/09/2022 2:37 AM] curbsideprophet#0000
[thread]: This is a mouthful so let‚Äôs see if I can get to them:

- Mentioned this needs to be centralized first to get up and running with a planned move to decentralization. How? Not sure yet we have not hit that fork in the road yet

- The applications section is a non-exhaustive list it ultimately comes down to whatever the person wants to explore when it comes to onchain data 

- Not sure why this wasn‚Äôt clear but two main customers are blockchain analysts who want a one stop shop for analyzing and visualizing utxo data straight from their web browser and actual report consumers who have questions about things like rich lists, token distribution, ergo Puell multiple charts, whatever that‚Äôs created by the analyst 

- Good question but again have not reached that bridge yet to even begin to answer this 

- MOOC is an example use case we can partner with someone like codecademy to provide the data and web UI to incorporate for a potential ‚Äúblockchain analyst‚Äù learning track specifically for UTXO model 

- Not sure yet that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a backlog item that we can get to whether or not we use UPoW or off chain bots (someone mentioned to me latter is more efficient too)

- The vision is ‚Äúumbrel for ergo‚Äù where someone can access straight from their node and before you ask jot sure how it would work yet 

- Also no clue about L2 solution but would love to further explore what that would look like


[05/09/2022 2:44 AM] curbsideprophet#0000
Definitely encourage you to check out dune analytics they live on eth chain and recently valued at $1B. 

No tokenomics or payments for their analysts just all ‚Äúgood will‚Äù with your traditional web2 framework. For Azorus want to change that where analysts are actually compensated for what they bring to the platform. 

This is why we need to start with web2 version where majority is familiar with. Does not make practical sense when general pop does not care about decentralization yet


[05/09/2022 2:58 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0000
[thread]: Yeah in general not too worried about this project starting out centralized. I don't think it would be viable if you guys tried to go for decentralization first, way too many issues you will run into there when you're first starting up. 

For customers, I was under the impression this data would be more focused on providing solutions to companies in need of specific stats and visualizations. I'm guessing that is covered by the second part of your answer?

So in general it seems like a lot of the ideas haven't been fully fleshed out yet (which is completely okay). So with that in mind, what would Azorus "1.0" look like? I understand it'd be centralized, and likely provide access to an API for a price. Are there any other specific details you can mention about that? What's your vision for it to look like in the next few months?

[05/09/2022 3:15 AM] curbsideprophet#0000
[thread]: Yeah great follow-up questions and something I am editing to add to WP.

There is general audience customer and enterprise customer. The 2nd one can either pay subscription, enlist a community analyst to help, or have someone on our team to build for them. This latter point especially important as a consulting aspect to help get them up and running for whatever data or charts they need without worrying about overhead (taken from my professional learning experiences as a consultant).

For me v1.0 is clear: web2 browser to query and analyze ergo data using SQL with something simple as high charts to visualize tabulated data, and jupyter/R notebook format to also do the same as above 

All of this will be free to use and access and open to everyone to see the code, charts, and data. However, we have a fast follow to start business development getting Edtech websites onboard for the paid services

@Cheese Enthusiast I am typing this all on phone so apologies for typos or anything may be unclear or not a good idea. Early feedback like this is what I appreciate most to ensure we handle any unknown-unknowns we did not consider.

Please keep them coming or how best I can assuage anything other questions, comments or concerns!

hi guys, can you explain a bit the need to have a separate token for this?

We could contribute ERG to the project, and then ERG could be used to use your analytics.

What is the token providing, except an exchange for our funding, to the project that the native ERG coin can't provide?

Thanks


[05/22/2022 4:21 PM] curbsideprophet#0000
[thread]: it is not out of the realm of possibilities but did you read the "tokenomics" section of the WP? although not finalized it alludes to the general direction we are headed - but i can broadly answer some of that here.

**investment vehicle**: bottom line is people want to see a return on their investment. they could hold ERG and fund the project with ERG but the last few months it has only been bleeding downward. why not contribute to an early project and then 5x your initial ERG investment amount when ERG is expected to go sideways in the foreseeable future?

**future product support**: there is a long term vision to make this a fully decentralized service. how do you incentivize actors in the economy, such as Data Providers or Computation Miners, to participate in it? There needs to be a reward for the services they provide. If you are thinking "why not ERG" then see above

**VC for non-VCs**: if you haven't already check out the original thesis behind ErgoPad...it's a method to get people invested in on projects early when it would normally be reserved for VC firms.

@curbsideprophet what backend are you running nodes on? I have a setup on AWS using load balancer and a simple python health check in case a node stalls (a node stall won't show error, but health script does). Or, perhaps you got things going that I might improve our setup with?

Hello *Team Azorus*,

Congratulations on an impressive project. It must be great to be part of the *Azorus.

*I wanted to ask if reaching an engaged audience of crypto traders‚Äô investors is a priority for your crypto project.

I know it's extremely important for projects like *Azorus* to get in front of the correct audience: -
- We have Investors with portfolios between $10k and $7.5 million
- Our Academy has a Crypto subscriber list of over 283,000 contacts
- The Platinum Trading Academy has over 10,000 Financial Traders.

If so, we‚Äôve helped/advertised Ledger hardware wallet, Atani, Aubit, the wise token with the same challenge through our Crypto Trading Academy.
Please let me know.
    
Thanks,  
PLATINUM CRYPTO ACADEMY

[12/21/2022 5:55 AM] Linnea1_PCA#0000
Hi *team Azoru*s‚Äì could we arrange a quick call?

I know this is very direct, but inboxes like yours get hectic. So, we could grab 10-15 mins. on the phone and cut all the hassle of a long message?
We work with businesses at the ICO stage, much like *Azorus* to get in front of the people who can make their projects successful.
Can we schedule a quick call?

Many Thanks,
Platinum Crypto Academy

it is still going though currently working on some backend changes to allow for dashboards to be public so ergonauts can share their beautiful creations

edit: or at least expose some of the dashboards i created from my videos so others can start referencing or interacting with it
