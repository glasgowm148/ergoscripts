I'll just share what works best for me:

NBMiner 39.4 
3070TI 176Mhs on 159W -400 +2200
3080TI 259Mhs on 215W 0 1650
3060TI Hynix 133Mhs on 122W -450 +1955 
3060TI Samsung 133Mhs on 122W -850 +2255
All cards are LHR.
Several get higher Ergo clocks  on Samsungwith latest 39.5 update. I dont have any results yet. Anyone tried 39.5?

NanoMiner 3.3.12
3070 MSI Gaming X Trio - 115W , 170MH/s
Core Clock: -200
Memory Clock: +1300
Power Limit: 55
Fan Speed: 70

Surprises me when i see others get much higher hash rates with what i determine are lower quality cards 😄 but thats obviously a comparison when it comes to gaming on the quality there

hey, I'm new to mining and this is my first setup, I'm finding ERGO the most profitable currently running nicehash version for easy deposit . this is only my first week of mining so any advice to modify my current setup would be great to hear. 
322.9 mh @ 395w

[09/28/2021 6:51 PM] KaZaK#4277
Yknow id expect the 3070ti to be a fair bit more then that for mining, is this an LHR model or something?


[09/28/2021 6:53 PM] geezar#8187
all 30 series 70ti's and 80ti's are LHR and all affected on this Algo - thats actually one of the better hashrates for the power I've seen


[09/28/2021 6:58 PM] KaZaK#4277
Oh that sucks, hopefully these workarounds ive seen cropping up with programs like t-rex start properly changing things


[09/28/2021 6:59 PM] geezar#8187
yes - development for sure is making progress


[09/28/2021 7:01 PM] KaZaK#4277
I was lucky, i got mine before LHR was a thing


[09/28/2021 7:01 PM] KaZaK#4277

Unfortunately anything over 145 trips the lhr for me


[09/28/2021 9:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
And terrible inefficient


[09/28/2021 9:29 PM] pbr713#9954
Yeah that’s about as high as I can get before lhr kicks in


[09/28/2021 9:30 PM] pbr713#9954
I could probably turn my fan down a bit for more efficiency


[09/28/2021 11:36 PM] apexpool#3878

Hey bro, I can't get to 180 MH/s for the same OC


[09/29/2021 12:47 AM] pbr713#9954
What are you getting? They are all different


[09/29/2021 12:48 AM] Mozzy#0397
Mine is Aorus 3070TI LHR

Core 1500 Mem 2425 PL 145 

@ 168 MH/s only


[09/29/2021 12:48 AM] Mozzy#0397
Can you suggest me a better OC ?


[09/29/2021 12:50 AM] pbr713#9954
Have you checked the pinned message in #⛏│mining ?


[09/29/2021 12:50 AM] pbr713#9954
Are you using hive?


[09/29/2021 12:51 AM] Mozzy#0397
Yes HiveOS


[09/29/2021 12:52 AM] pbr713#9954
I’m windows using afterburner so I can adjust on the fly. I start pretty much stock and adjust slowly. I don’t think that’s possible with hive though

So you're -500 +1500, but I dont know what is the stock setting to start


[09/29/2021 12:54 AM] Mozzy#0397
in HiveOS the setting is left blank and you have to input the absolute setting


[09/29/2021 12:54 AM] Mozzy#0397

[09/29/2021 1:00 AM] pbr713#9954
That -1095 was the top listed on the spreadsheet in hive


[09/29/2021 1:01 AM] Mozzy#0397
weird


[09/29/2021 1:02 AM] Mozzy#0397
in HiveOS, they do have recommend OC setting that most miners do, but I can't see one has Mem clock over 3000


[09/29/2021 1:02 AM] Mozzy#0397
most of them are stick around 2500-2600 Mem


[09/29/2021 1:03 AM] pbr713#9954
I don’t know a lot about hive so I can’t really help you more. But I would work your way through the spreadsheet and see what you can come up with


[09/29/2021 1:05 AM] Mozzy#0397
Do you know the base OC setting of 3070TI before we do any adjustment ?


[09/29/2021 1:05 AM] Mozzy#0397
or it doesnt show on Windows ?

[09/29/2021 8:20 AM] Kreuzi#0789
i twith the same settings in windows (-275core, +3000mem, 50%PL 144W) for my 3070ti i get about 174mh/s wow sweet


[09/29/2021 8:21 AM] Kreuzi#0789
30W less for 5mh/s loss


[09/29/2021 8:22 AM] Kreuzi#0789
gona try to raise the pl a little and see if a few more W gets me the mh back


[09/29/2021 8:22 AM] Kreuzi#0789
but everytime i change something the card drops to 80mh/s for 2min or so till it recovers


[09/29/2021 8:24 AM] Kreuzi#0789
ok, 53% pl breaks it completly lol


[09/29/2021 8:24 AM] apexpool#3878
decrease the power when that happens.


[09/29/2021 8:30 AM] Kreuzi#0789
i tried 51, 52 and 53, an all of them make the hashrate fall to 110 and stick there, but at 50% i get 174 lol


[09/29/2021 8:30 AM] apexpool#3878
then stick to 50% 🙂


[09/29/2021 8:31 AM] apexpool#3878
temperature is also important. lower temperature -> lower power required for the same hashrate, at least for my 3070ti cards.


[09/29/2021 8:31 AM] Kreuzi#0789
just gona try a few more (54 - 59) but i think the most likly conclusion will be to stick to 50 y ^^ thanks for your help

what 3070ti cards do you have? mines are FE.


[09/29/2021 8:32 AM] Kreuzi#0789
y, it decreasd the temp for a few °C too


[09/29/2021 8:32 AM] Kreuzi#0789
mine is also an fe


[09/29/2021 8:33 AM] apexpool#3878
then it should be similar.


[09/29/2021 8:38 AM] Kreuzi#0789
looks like 55% 166W gets me 180MH/s


[09/29/2021 8:38 AM] Kreuzi#0789
but not constantly 😮


[09/29/2021 8:39 AM] apexpool#3878
174 is better for 144w


[09/29/2021 8:39 AM] apexpool#3878
if your electricity is expensive, at least


[09/29/2021 8:40 AM] Kreuzi#0789

{Reactions}
💯 

[09/29/2021 8:44 AM] Kreuzi#0789
looks like the 166W oc always breaks form time to time, even if it reaches 181mh/s sometimes i will lower it again for constant 174mh/s for 144W


[09/29/2021 10:53 AM] geezar#8187

77w but in reality around 125w at the wall for the 150 MH/s


[09/29/2021 10:55 AM] geezar#8187
32w for the extra 30 MH/s may be worth it but sweet spot IMO is the 150 MH/s


[09/29/2021 10:56 AM] geezar#8187
Core never above 51c and Junction 57c - pushing them very hard generates a lot more heat


[09/29/2021 10:57 AM] geezar#8187
Hynix was not stable 725mv but 731mv dropped this down to 72-73w - all depends on your efficiency goals


[09/29/2021 11:04 AM] apexpool#3878
I'm running these settings for some time, and then I'll probably try something for more efficiency.

I dont know how to check in hiveos lol, but based on your hashrate and power consumption, im guessing those are hynix because if they were samsung and you were using nbminer, they could go up to 14x mh/s


[09/30/2021 1:40 PM] frackz#5914
In Hiveos you can check it on the browser, not in the app i think


[09/30/2021 1:44 PM] frackz#5914
Both these settings dont work for my 3070TI's btw. From 1850 Mem and above, hash goes down.

[10/03/2021 10:54 AM] geezar#8187
The 70ti will achieve `182 MH/s at 150w` and the `80ti 264 MH/s at 215w` - for the moment not worth the extra watts for my setup.


[10/03/2021 10:56 AM] geezar#8187
This is on Linux testing various drivers from early to current - I'll post back if any improvements but for 'some GPU's' the lower levels are out of reach for these GPU's at least

These clocks have been running for a few days - sometimes the hash spikes up 2-3 MH/s on occasion, usually with a fresh reboot but these are the 24/7 averages fwiw

jessus christ, this discord group is way better than them ergo mining fb groups


[10/03/2021 3:29 PM] Runstyle#5968
able to achieve these with 3070ti battle ax. 
i rly want to achieve 130w+ wioth 170mh/s but so far no luck. nbminer39.5 lhr 100

gonna give it a try. your's are the FE edition right? hopefully i can achieve the same..

latest version t-rex? did you put any extra parameters?


[10/03/2021 4:55 PM] apexpool#3878
3070ti FE
except from what you can see, "intensity": "20" as extra parameter to t-rex in hiveos. latest version of t-rex with latest drivers.

Has anyone else achieved the same hash and power Apex? not seen any posts with the same low power - perhaps this is the FE Model 70ti - not even close to getting as low


[10/03/2021 7:10 PM] SnowPea#7485
For windows, -245 core, lock core at 1282, mem 1350, 117 mh/s at 90w (lhr v2)

@apexpool Can I ask if you have ever tried your 3070ti FE cards in windows? I am trying to get an OC set on afterburner. I am using -500 +1200 and getting good results on eth and ergo, 174mh and 43mh but it's at 180w. When I try to drop the power below 60% on ergo it drops the mh to under 140

nope


[10/04/2021 4:17 AM] BigDog#8953
Yeah I heard some people say that but not from EVGA so far


[10/04/2021 6:22 AM] apexpool#3878
I did, more than a month ago, but not for a long time, and I did not try many things. the best results I had with t-rex and core clock locked at 1500, and power locked around 140w-145w, but I don't remember the hashrate... I did not try Afterburner then.

Hey all...I'm having a difficult time OC'ing 3060 Ti's in Hive OS. I've seen the spreadsheet with all the reported numbers...but is there a general guidance on HOW to OC these? Like the specific order? PL first, then core, memory?


[10/06/2021 2:56 PM] apexpool#3878
try this:
nbminer 39.5 with LHR 85 as option
1500 core clock 
2600 memory clock 
power limit 120w (it will use less, I guess because of the LHR option)
with these settings my card (Gigabyte Eagle OC with Samsung memory) does 142.1 MH/s at 98w


[10/06/2021 2:57 PM] geezar#8187
98w is nice....

a few days ago


[10/06/2021 2:58 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, very good performance... waiting for t-rex and the next nbminer releases


[10/06/2021 2:59 PM] apexpool#3878
I'm sure it can do >150 MH/s. I saw it when mining starts sometimes, before LHR does its stuff.


[10/06/2021 3:00 PM] geezar#8187
LHR 60ti with Samsung must be the most efficient GPU on the algo at the moment at those power levels


[10/06/2021 3:01 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, too bad you cannot find them at reasonable prices. for 600 Euro I would buy another 3 right now.


[10/06/2021 3:01 PM] apexpool#3878
(3 because I have 3 free slots)

and I am not sure about the 8pin cables how I can get so many...


[10/06/2021 3:05 PM] geezar#8187
If you have the power just run another USB adapter


[10/06/2021 3:05 PM] geezar#8187
the CPU will have more than enough PCI lanes


[10/06/2021 3:06 PM] geezar#8187

that 2nd rig is coming...


[10/06/2021 3:17 PM] apexpool#3878
it is running with 2 power supplies since I have 2 Vega cards, one was not enough. 1200w + 850w.


[10/06/2021 3:18 PM] apexpool#3878
I am sorry I did not buy a bigger one when I bought that 850w PSU...

I would have never payed 800 Euro for a GPU for gaming.


[10/06/2021 3:48 PM] apexpool#3878
I thought about it for weeks before buying a 200 Euro GPU for gaming... GTX 1650. It is really good for what we need.


[10/06/2021 3:53 PM] geezar#8187
The lust to fill up those PCI lanes is strong I can see... almost as strong as ETH and BTC today 🙂


[10/06/2021 4:22 PM] swankerme#7257
I have Zotacs with Hynix Memory...these things struggle over 2000 Mem Clock. Pulling 132 MH/s currently


[10/06/2021 4:25 PM] apexpool#3878
lhr unlock works only for Samsung now. bad luck I guess. hopefully they will do it for Hynix, too.

looking for ocs on msi airboost vega 56 windows or hive if anyone can point me the right way. thanks


[10/07/2021 5:11 PM] geezar#8187
I run one - annoying it needs more mv to keep stable but I run very lean on it - 1090/701/762 for 150 MH/s - 94w reported, unlike some others that can run much less mv


[10/07/2021 5:12 PM] geezar#8187
at the wall more like 130-135w

175w... is wasting power - no need anywhere near that IMO

[10/08/2021 1:31 PM] geezar#8187
very high power - I run the 3070 FE founders with 1080/2600 for 173 MH/s at only 120w. worth considering dropping that lock clock IMO

[10/08/2021 3:36 PM] SnowPea#7485
I still prefer lower power, 50w for 5 mh is not worth for me since the electricity is kinda expensive here


[10/08/2021 4:30 PM] geezar#8187
What driver are you using? -200/2600/120PL should do high 160's easy on that


[10/08/2021 4:31 PM] geezar#8187
Agree I think the issue is he's unable to get it to hash well - very unusual to push a non LHR with that much power


[10/08/2021 5:58 PM] SnowPea#7485
Despite of his power consumption, I'm actually quite impressed on his card being pushed so much and yet there's no stale or invalid shares. I even tried to lower my mem clock to 1250 and I still got invalid shares once in a while. If I set the mem clock at 1350, the invalid share percentage will be over 0.25%, which is still acceptable, but I just like to stay within 0.1%


[10/08/2021 5:58 PM] geezar#8187
You have Hynix Snow?


[10/08/2021 5:59 PM] SnowPea#7485

[10/08/2021 6:01 PM] SnowPea#7485
I dont set any power limit (at 0 by default) since i locked the core


[10/08/2021 6:03 PM] SnowPea#7485
The middle one is the lhr 60ti, the hashrate jumps between 129 to 131, power jumps between 109 to 112

Until after my last tuning and i was able to get it to 1.19~1.21MH/s


[10/08/2021 6:12 PM] geezar#8187
1080ti does couple MH/s more.... but TBH with + 40w


[10/08/2021 6:12 PM] geezar#8187
Lets see.... maybe some super hero miner will come out for Hynix... 😄


[10/08/2021 6:12 PM] SnowPea#7485

@geezar do you tune the card in msi ab?


[10/08/2021 6:59 PM] geezar#8187
Nope Linux - 1100 core got it to 126... so improving..... long haul lets see..


[10/08/2021 6:59 PM] SnowPea#7485
Nice, hope you'll break 130

Do you start from 0 and -50 each time?


[10/08/2021 10:12 PM] geezar#8187

it goes between 135.7 - 136.5


[10/09/2021 7:24 PM] andee#4722
have to tick box to force P0 state to maximize memclock, or it will boost and crash miner

is nbminer working better for you?


[10/09/2021 7:57 PM] Attila#3944
unfortunately the zotac card becomes unstable even though that one is untouched. I'll have to set this back to the setting above


[10/09/2021 7:57 PM] Attila#3944
haven't really played around with trex yet. Is it better?


[10/09/2021 7:58 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, really better.


[10/09/2021 7:58 PM] Attila#3944
in what sense?


[10/09/2021 7:58 PM] apexpool#3878
for maybe a week nbminer was better, until the last update of t-rex, which is really better.


[10/09/2021 7:58 PM] apexpool#3878
lower power, higher hashrate.

[10/09/2021 8:22 PM] Attila#3944
Switched to trex and reverted back to these settings. These seem to be stable. Unfortunately if I set p0 on one card the others on the rig need to go along. Zotacs don't seem to be able to handle @andee 's settings and they kick the bucket while the Asus cards happily work at 137MH.

[10/09/2021 8:23 PM] Attila#3944
That one Zotac card that's the odd one out doesn't seem to handle what the others can do.


[10/09/2021 8:23 PM] SnowPea#7485
@geezar i finally got mine to 132mh, but cant get pass that


[10/09/2021 8:24 PM] andee#4722
did you try reducing the clocks on the zotac?


[10/09/2021 8:24 PM] andee#4722
if you ssh to the rig you can look at the clocks with `nvtool -c`


[10/09/2021 8:24 PM] andee#4722
to compare before and after p0


[10/09/2021 8:26 PM] Attila#3944
nah, that's some next level stuff for me at this point


[10/09/2021 8:26 PM] Attila#3944
just familiarizing myself with the concept


[10/09/2021 8:26 PM] andee#4722
max mem clock was around 2300 without p0, you could try that on the asus cards


[10/09/2021 8:26 PM] Attila#3944
literally the second day mining


[10/09/2021 8:26 PM] Attila#3944

[10/09/2021 8:27 PM] Attila#3944
When I have everything in place I'll set it up so that I'm happy with what I'm seeing and that it doesn't break


[10/09/2021 8:30 PM] andee#4722
having them stable +130 is a great start 😃


[10/09/2021 8:30 PM] Attila#3944
yep 🙂


[10/09/2021 8:31 PM] Attila#3944
I guess if they don't break in a day and there are barely any rejected shares they can run indefinitely


[10/09/2021 8:31 PM] Attila#3944
I'd imagine if it breaks it breaks in a few minutes


[10/09/2021 9:23 PM] Dv#3650
You'd think, but that isn't always the case


[10/09/2021 9:24 PM] Dv#3650
I spent the last 3 days trying to figure out why my miner was restarting every 20, 30, 60 or even 120 minutes


[10/09/2021 9:25 PM] Attila#3944
Nice 🙂


[10/10/2021 8:05 AM] Attila#3944
Hive said P0 boosts 400mhz. Does this only mean mem clock? I don’t want to fry my cards 🙂


[10/10/2021 8:07 AM] andee#4722
I think it varies, for me it stopped my card from boosting over my overclock. too high mem oc will just crash miner with memory error, it does not fry your card


[10/10/2021 8:07 AM] Attila#3944
Thanks!


[10/10/2021 8:08 AM] andee#4722
your zotac might have been boosted, so it would probably be best to start at no oc, only power limit

{Reactions}
💪🏻 

[10/10/2021 8:08 AM] Attila#3944
I think I’ll just set p0 then leave my asus cards with your settings and reduce all other cards by 400 on mem


[10/10/2021 8:09 AM] Attila#3944
I’ll try to research what exactly p0 does


[10/10/2021 8:09 AM] andee#4722
yeah, because if it boosts the zotac it will end up being the same. if it boost 400MHz you would have to reduce by 800 though, since the Linux numbers are double


[10/10/2021 8:09 AM] Attila#3944
What puzzles me is the single zotac in my bigger count rig that can’t even take 2000


[10/10/2021 8:10 AM] andee#4722
I think its just power state, if the card is in P2 the card is allowed to dynamically change clocks


[10/10/2021 8:10 AM] Attila#3944
Good point, I would have thought 400 in the input is 400 in the p0 description too


[10/10/2021 8:11 AM] Attila#3944
So p0 locks in the clock basically?


[10/10/2021 8:11 AM] andee#4722
I had my card running at 7950 memclock, but in P2 it suddenly boosted (200MHz from what I saw) and crashed because of too high oc


[10/10/2021 8:11 AM] andee#4722
now its running stable at 8050


[10/10/2021 8:12 AM] Attila#3944
Cool, thanks for the input


[10/10/2021 8:12 AM] Attila#3944
Will try later in the day


[10/10/2021 8:12 AM] andee#4722
👍  so the store is giving you all the cards you ordered? 😄


[10/10/2021 8:15 AM] Attila#3944
I got 7 so far. Just my luck - still haven’t got my money back so I mobilized all my ADA + easily available cash to get these 7 cards. I have 4 ADA to my name. And now my favorite Cardano project is holding a token sale from today, until tomorrow at the latest, out of the blue. Anyway, the store apparently accidentally sold the rest of my cards so I couldn’t get them before Monday or Tuesday anyway.


[10/10/2021 8:16 AM] Attila#3944
Now I really just hope that mining stays profitable cause all my eggs are in one basket at this point


[10/10/2021 8:17 AM] andee#4722

[10/10/2021 8:17 AM] Attila#3944

I might have to refine my coin switcher before it happens 😅


[10/10/2021 8:19 AM] andee#4722
only mining ergo right now, but might start with some speculative mining in addition to profit


[10/10/2021 8:23 AM] Attila#3944
My issue is that there’s a 35% tax on mining here so mining for profit is not necessarily good, but once you converted it to any other crypto any gains you make are tax free in case you hodl for a year


[10/10/2021 8:24 AM] Attila#3944
So the idea is that with erg mined I flip to sigmausd and back, generate tax and hodl hoping for a moonshot


[10/10/2021 8:38 AM] andee#4722
hm, that sounds like a nice loophole 😃


[10/10/2021 9:02 AM] geezar#8187
136.10 MH/s stable day 3 (Hynix...)


[10/10/2021 9:03 AM] geezar#8187

[10/10/2021 9:03 AM] geezar#8187

in an hour or so


[10/10/2021 9:20 AM] geezar#8187
lost 2 MH/s - perhaps needs different clocks - will stick with 470.74 for now

Stable but she does not want to show me love... thinking maybe take her out... show her a good time.... at the moment no love.... damn Hynix


[10/10/2021 5:47 PM] apexpool#3878
2 weeks ago you were happy with this hashrate 👀


[10/10/2021 5:47 PM] geezar#8187
Only had this GPU for 3 days - this is a new Hynix GPU... I would be much happier if she would put out... she maybe needs time...


[10/10/2021 5:48 PM] geezar#8187
Well perhaps you are right.. that said when you hit 155... you set a new goal 🙂

[10/10/2021 5:48 PM] geezar#8187
FWIW not worth trying any of the LHR settings even 80 upwards (no difference)


[10/10/2021 5:49 PM] apexpool#3878
now I am trying dual mining with the latest t-rex release and I cannot disable lhr auto-tune


[10/10/2021 5:49 PM] apexpool#3878
it increases the value from 30 and at 37 the ergo hashrate drops a lot.


[10/10/2021 5:50 PM] geezar#8187
interesting - disabled removed it completely

[10/10/2021 5:50 PM] geezar#8187
I am staying away from dual for the moment, the power hike is significant (appreciate more profit) but for the moment too much


[10/10/2021 5:51 PM] apexpool#3878
hmmm.... I just noticed I wrote if wrong, I corrected it and restarted.


[10/10/2021 5:53 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, looking good now.


[10/10/2021 5:53 PM] apexpool#3878
"lhr-autotune-mode": "off"


[10/10/2021 5:54 PM] apexpool#3878
I forgot "-mode" earlier, and tried all possible for "off" and it was obviously not working 😂


[10/10/2021 6:31 PM] geezar#8187
Are you dual mining now @apexpool ?


[10/10/2021 6:31 PM] apexpool#3878
yes


[10/10/2021 6:32 PM] geezar#8187
I did not test it for long TBH but happy with the results?


[10/10/2021 6:32 PM] apexpool#3878
not really happy


[10/10/2021 6:33 PM] apexpool#3878
I am trying to understand how much should be the hashrate for ETH compared to ERG to make it more profitable...

except GPU2, but that has a fucky bios so I will just leave it at 1k voltage, I'm shipping it off tomorrow anyways cause it was already sold


[10/11/2021 2:47 AM] andee#4722
nice! did you measure power reduction at wall?


[10/11/2021 2:47 AM] Ananas#9063
i dont have a power meter yet


[10/11/2021 2:48 AM] Ananas#9063
but as soon as i have I'll take a look


[10/11/2021 2:48 AM] Ananas#9063
isn't the AMD consumption just simply 40 watts more than what is displayed?


[10/11/2021 2:48 AM] Ananas#9063
or is it more complicated than that


[10/11/2021 2:49 AM] andee#4722
its an okay estimate


[10/11/2021 2:50 AM] Ananas#9063
for eg it says 80 watts for a card, I assume it's around 120


[10/11/2021 2:50 AM] Ananas#9063
idk how they fucked it up so bad that there is such a tremendous difference between reported and actual


[10/11/2021 2:51 AM] andee#4722
accurate power reporting hasn't really been important before mining


[10/11/2021 2:52 AM] andee#4722
It excludes power from riser (I think)


[10/11/2021 2:54 AM] Ananas#9063
hmm could be, I guess it's also dependent on how much the card picks up from the riser, I had one 1660s pick up 50 watts from the riser, the other one next to it 6 watts


[10/11/2021 2:54 AM] Ananas#9063
even though everything was the same for them, power supply etc except their models

[10/11/2021 6:26 AM] SnowPea#7485
@geezar i just tried trex 24.0 and set the lhr tune to 95 for both mu 3060ti (hynix mem) and 3060, when i restarted the miner, the 60ti showed 146mh/s and 60 showed 134mh/s, then a couple of seconds later they dropped back to 132 (60ti) and 117 (60), does that mean hynix can also be able to unlock to 146mh?


[10/11/2021 7:52 AM] Ananas#9063
@andee what do you think about these settings? (I might have just spent the last 5 hours optimizing the rig on my second monitor...)

according to my calculations, if I can get 1 MH for 4 watts extra it's worth it, any more than that is not economical


[10/11/2021 9:55 AM] andee#4722
nice speed 😃 very consistent,  remember that ~4 software Watts is ~6W

lottery 😄 whats up with the 1060?


[10/11/2021 10:11 AM] Ananas#9063
Man if I had all this info you taught me in the last 12 hours I woulda gotten so many lottery cards, I bought like 30 of these and resold them. I shoulda tested all of them and kept the good ones D:


[10/11/2021 10:11 AM] Ananas#9063

what hash do you get on the 1060? found a 6GB for ~200€


[10/11/2021 10:37 AM] Ananas#9063
they get 23-25


[10/11/2021 10:38 AM] Ananas#9063
200 eur is really good, buy it, worst case I'll buy it from you if you dont like it 😄


[10/11/2021 10:39 AM] Ananas#9063
First half of the year I was just checking most EU stores multiple times a day, and got the cards as soon as they went up. Now I'm buying used older gens and selling those


[10/11/2021 10:39 AM] Ananas#9063
there's a big mining rush here, fucking idiots buying 3070s for ~2K USD

[10/11/2021 11:09 AM] geezar#8187
Settled with same clocks - no lhr settings improve the hash - 43 MH/s on pure ETH and 136 MH/s on ERG - dual mining was a joke... so may even just stick it on pure ETH


[10/11/2021 11:13 AM] apexpool#3878
how do you get 43 MH/s on ETH? what settings and which miner, t-rex?


[10/11/2021 11:26 AM] geezar#8187
42-43 yep


[10/11/2021 11:26 AM] geezar#8187
Not tested all but T-Rex so far


[10/11/2021 11:27 AM] geezar#8187
1350/2200/120 - not venturing too far from those clocks TBH

pretty sure once dialled in will do a touch more but TBH - day 4 trying to get > 135 on ERG has been long enough, see how it gets on once more testing done


[10/11/2021 11:35 AM] geezar#8187
Goal on this one would be to achieve better power, hash and purchase cost for 2 Hynix as opposed to an 80ti - see how it goes


[10/11/2021 11:39 AM] apexpool#3878
I get 41.5 MH/s with nbminer lhr 85 on my 3060ti


[10/11/2021 11:39 AM] apexpool#3878
I cannot try t-rex right now because I am using it for dual mining with the 3070ti cards.


[10/11/2021 11:41 AM] geezar#8187
This is a Hynix and for the moment but best option TBH


[10/11/2021 11:42 AM] geezar#8187
125w however... that said 2 of them will = an 80ti running 280w-300w... so perhaps something positive from catching the Hynix virus


[10/11/2021 11:42 AM] geezar#8187
Thats a Samsung no? would have assumed would have done better than its poor relation? (assume power much lower)

it's running with lhr 67.2 actually, 85 was for erg

and pl 115w


[10/11/2021 11:53 AM] geezar#8187
You should achieve more, pure ETH was the only thing worth putting it on, not tested RVN or anything else yet. Spent most of the time on ERG. TBH unless it can do better think it will stay on there - LHR 72


[10/11/2021 11:53 AM] geezar#8187
PL125


[10/11/2021 11:53 AM] geezar#8187

[10/11/2021 1:17 PM] geezar#8187

[10/11/2021 1:18 PM] geezar#8187
1350/2220/PL125 - LHR 76 no go - sweet range seems 73-75 but needs a lot of time to bed in


[10/11/2021 1:19 PM] apexpool#3878
how do you set memory clock on command line for t-rex in linux?


[10/11/2021 1:19 PM] geezar#8187
` --cclock                   Sets GPU core clock offset in MHz.

Letting it stick on what its doing for a few hours - pool reporting acurately so positive


[10/11/2021 1:21 PM] geezar#8187
Need to get that PL down but we'll see - lots of testing to do - most probably keep it on ETH

Just set it in Hive then


[10/11/2021 1:22 PM] geezar#8187
Samsung should do better perhaps, your already 10w less for same hash


[10/11/2021 1:22 PM] apexpool#3878
```20211011 14:22:32 ERROR: Can't start T-Rex, GPU memory clock control is not supported on Linux

[10/11/2021 1:23 PM] apexpool#3878
testing now with 125w power limit


[10/11/2021 1:24 PM] apexpool#3878
I'm using 1485 core clock because in my tests it had the best results with nbminer on ETH with this card.

[10/11/2021 1:24 PM] apexpool#3878
so far similar hashrate with higher power usage.


[10/11/2021 1:24 PM] geezar#8187
Not tested NB will try that next


[10/11/2021 1:24 PM] apexpool#3878

I guess I have to wait a few minutes to settle


[10/11/2021 1:25 PM] apexpool#3878
the 3060ti has better hashrate on eth than the 3070tis


[10/11/2021 1:25 PM] geezar#8187
I'll try locking higher too - 1350 is stable

better than nbminer

I would stick with that Apex - let her run for some hours


[10/11/2021 1:46 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, I will. I switched the 3070ti cards completely to erg and I'll let the 3060ti cards on eth from command line, to nbe able to read the power usage on the wall meter and the eth hashrate on the mining pool for the card alone.

90.12 MH/s ETH for 224w.... not a bad result on 2 of them Apex.

anyone got experience with 1060 6 gigs? The hashrate is great, but im wondering if i could reduce the consumption


[10/11/2021 2:54 PM] Ananas#9063
ah sorry it's ETH not ERG


[10/11/2021 3:14 PM] SnowPea#7485
This is amazing! i remember my hynix could only get to 30mh when i was mining with nicehash back then. Im only mining ergo and not planning to dual mining since i dont see the benefit from doing that, but im just curious that when the miner first started running, how could the hynix go all the way up to 146mh for a few seconds lol


[10/11/2021 3:21 PM] geezar#8187
Still stable - settled with 1300/2200/120 for 42 MH/s - ERG still think more to come but maxed out 136 MH/s 110w - ETH struggling to bring the power down but pretty good so far


[10/11/2021 3:21 PM] geezar#8187
Little more hope for Hynix IMO


[10/11/2021 3:31 PM] SnowPea#7485
Yea, i think so, and my 3060 started with 134mh for a few seconds too!


[10/11/2021 3:32 PM] SnowPea#7485
Hopefully someday a miner can unlock 100%


[10/11/2021 3:32 PM] geezar#8187
I've got it stable at 74... so only 26 more to go 🙂


[10/11/2021 3:32 PM] SnowPea#7485

have you tried manually applying?

[10/11/2021 3:36 PM] geezar#8187
annoying


[10/11/2021 3:37 PM] geezar#8187
Iday 4 moved it to ETH - that said it was stable 100% 135 MH/s - need to run the numbers 135 MHs v 42 MHs - for profit


[10/11/2021 3:38 PM] geezar#8187
+$0.90 in favour of ETH - all relative as I need to +15w over ETH and not selling either 'today' anyway


[10/11/2021 3:50 PM] SnowPea#7485
Im not aiming for daily profit and since i dont have high hash power, its better for me to concentrate on one coin


[10/11/2021 3:51 PM] SnowPea#7485
I thought about mining eth and buy erg with it, but it'd take me too long to get a payout in eth and the tax would be more complicated, so i decided to just stick with erg


[10/11/2021 3:56 PM] geezar#8187
Yep - makes sense, many of the pools allow lower payouts - the one I use 0.01 but adding gas fees etc may not work out


[10/11/2021 4:04 PM] SnowPea#7485
Yea, gas fee is another reason i didnt want to do it. I thought about going back to nicehash when erg's diff is high, but again, the complicated tax stopped me


[10/11/2021 4:04 PM] apexpool#3878
I am taking payouts for ETH on Matic network, to avoid gas fees.


[10/11/2021 4:04 PM] apexpool#3878
I hope I will be able to use them later 🙂


[10/11/2021 4:05 PM] apexpool#3878
but it should work through an Exchange accepting Matic network

{Reactions}
👍 

[10/11/2021 4:05 PM] SnowPea#7485
But there will be exchange fee right


[10/11/2021 4:05 PM] SnowPea#7485
So it'll be similar to gas fee


[10/11/2021 4:06 PM] apexpool#3878
you need to use an exchange anyway if you want to convert to fiat, right? I never converted crypto to fiat, only to other crypto.


[10/11/2021 4:08 PM] Ananas#9063
exchange fee is 0.3%


[10/11/2021 4:08 PM] Ananas#9063
so nothing


[10/11/2021 4:08 PM] Ananas#9063
im not familiar with matic, how does it work?


[10/11/2021 4:08 PM] apexpool#3878
it's a layer 2 on ethereum. I have wrapped eth now


[10/11/2021 4:08 PM] apexpool#3878
0.01 so far 😂


[10/11/2021 4:08 PM] SnowPea#7485
That im not sure neither never converted


[10/11/2021 4:09 PM] SnowPea#7485
Im wondering whats the best way to convert erg to usd


[10/11/2021 4:09 PM] apexpool#3878
either exchange or p2p, I guess.


[10/11/2021 4:10 PM] Ananas#9063
can you swap wrapped eth to MATIC?


[10/11/2021 4:10 PM] Ananas#9063
for a low fee on the network


[10/11/2021 4:10 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, you can.


[10/11/2021 4:10 PM] Ananas#9063
what's the fee?

[10/11/2021 4:12 PM] Ananas#9063
ok so 10 cents for 0.01 eth


[10/11/2021 4:13 PM] Ananas#9063
if I understand correctly


[10/11/2021 4:13 PM] Ananas#9063
idk what price impact is


[10/11/2021 4:13 PM] Ananas#9063
is that some polygon app?


[10/11/2021 4:13 PM] Ananas#9063
if you can convert eth to matic this cheaply


[10/11/2021 4:13 PM] Ananas#9063
then you can just send the matic to an exchange


[10/11/2021 4:13 PM] Ananas#9063
e.g coinex


[10/11/2021 4:16 PM] Ananas#9063
ill look into this soon more in-depth, looks interesting


[10/11/2021 4:16 PM] apexpool#3878

[10/11/2021 4:16 PM] apexpool#3878
I watched an youtube video, someone mining and explaining this


[10/11/2021 4:17 PM] apexpool#3878
starting from the ethermine offering payments over Matic network


[10/11/2021 4:18 PM] apexpool#3878
I think eth is also a good one to hold


[10/11/2021 4:20 PM] SnowPea#7485
Is matic = polygon?


[10/11/2021 4:21 PM] apexpool#3878
yes


[10/11/2021 4:22 PM] SnowPea#7485
Ok, so eth to wallet, then wallet to coinbase, then eth > matic and then matic to usd?


[10/11/2021 4:22 PM] Ananas#9063
it fails at the first step


[10/11/2021 4:22 PM] Ananas#9063
you want to get paid in layer 2 ETH if I understand correctly


[10/11/2021 4:23 PM] Ananas#9063
then eth->matic->exchange->USD


[10/11/2021 4:23 PM] Ananas#9063
for less than 1% total fee


[10/11/2021 4:23 PM] SnowPea#7485
Hmm, whats layer 2 eth? lol


[10/11/2021 4:24 PM] geezar#8187
I just accept a small gas fee and keep my ETH in a nice wallet I have the keys too. If you wish to trade makes more sense to transfer direct to exchange, I've done both TBH


[10/11/2021 4:24 PM] Ananas#9063
@apexpool said ethermine offers matic network payouts i think


[10/11/2021 4:24 PM] Ananas#9063
if thats the case then it's easy peasy

[10/11/2021 4:33 PM] Ananas#9063
ok so basically you get wrapped eth as your payout from ethermine, which has no transaction fee because it's covered by the pool


[10/11/2021 4:33 PM] Ananas#9063
and once you have your wrapped eth you convert it to matic for a 0.3% fee, which then you can send over to an exchange


[10/11/2021 4:33 PM] Ananas#9063
where you sell the matic for 0.3% fee to get USDT


[10/11/2021 4:36 PM] Ananas#9063
so all in all you pay about 0.6% fee give or take, and that includes all costs


[10/11/2021 5:18 PM] geezar#8187
In comparison on the pool I'm on to achieve the same would mean a payout of 0.1 ETH and a very low < 30 Gas fee

so I guess it is ok to get ethermine's offer with matic network...


[10/11/2021 5:42 PM] Ananas#9063
I'll put it to the test after I withdraw from flexpool, got some balance there


[10/11/2021 6:16 PM] SnowPea#7485
0.1 eth would take me forever lol


[10/11/2021 6:35 PM] apexpool#3878
it's 0.005 on ethermine


[10/11/2021 6:36 PM] apexpool#3878
(payment on matic network)


[10/11/2021 6:40 PM] geezar#8187
whatever works - for me will stay as is, ETH is a long term play


[10/11/2021 6:41 PM] SnowPea#7485
I like the ergo project, but the price is a bit concerning me


[10/11/2021 6:42 PM] SnowPea#7485
It's been stuck at $10 for a while and it even went down to $9.6


[10/11/2021 7:18 PM] Ananas#9063
youre too zoomed in


[10/11/2021 7:32 PM] SnowPea#7485
Yea, definitely


[10/11/2021 7:32 PM] SnowPea#7485
I probably need to pull myself back a bit, just let it mine and stop thinking about it too much


[10/11/2021 7:33 PM] SnowPea#7485
Im not planning to sell anytime soon, and maybe its a good thing for the price to stay low then ppl will be more focused on other coins

[10/11/2021 11:07 PM] robot🤖armpits💪#2919
trial an error, but if the card that has OC, usually have higher clocks.


[10/11/2021 11:10 PM] SnowPea#7485
Mine is msi rtx 3060ti ventus 2x 8g ocv1 lhr


[10/11/2021 11:11 PM] SnowPea#7485
And yet, it couldnt go over 1100 lol, i tried 1050 and the miner just threw the illegal memery error and restarted every 5 min


[10/11/2021 11:12 PM] SnowPea#7485
So virtual memory doesnt play a part in this right?


[10/11/2021 11:12 PM] robot🤖armpits💪#2919
there's a setting to uncheck in MSI, hopefully you don't have it enabled


[10/11/2021 11:12 PM] SnowPea#7485
My rig has 8gb ram and i set the virtual memory at 28gb (two 3060ti 8g and one 3060 12g)

I think i have it checked, but im not using msi ab currently, just setting it directly on trex's webui


[10/11/2021 11:14 PM] robot🤖armpits💪#2919
oh, unchecked it


[10/11/2021 11:14 PM] robot🤖armpits💪#2919
with it enabled, MSI can control the hardware.  It causes crashes


[10/11/2021 11:14 PM] SnowPea#7485
Ooh! will do that now


[10/11/2021 11:20 PM] SnowPea#7485

[10/11/2021 11:20 PM] SnowPea#7485
Ok, i guess i'll just settle with 988

lhr


[10/11/2021 11:50 PM] SnowPea#7485
70%, instant crash at 1100


[10/11/2021 11:51 PM] robot🤖armpits💪#2919
can you lower to 55-60%?


[10/11/2021 11:53 PM] SnowPea#7485
Yes, but still mem clock cant go pass 1100


[10/11/2021 11:54 PM] robot🤖armpits💪#2919
I never had RTX 3k MSI.  I'm out of ideas


[10/11/2021 11:54 PM] SnowPea#7485
Just tried 0/50/100 core offset, lock core at 1380/1400/1450, the hashrate actually dropped from 132 to 130


[10/11/2021 11:55 PM] SnowPea#7485
Yea, im back to 0 core, lock core at 1365 and mem clock at 988, 132mh


[10/11/2021 11:55 PM] robot🤖armpits💪#2919
have you tried locking at 875V?


[10/11/2021 11:57 PM] SnowPea#7485
No, it wont go that high, i could lock the mV at 875, but the line would never reach that mv


[10/11/2021 11:57 PM] robot🤖armpits💪#2919
gotcha


[10/11/2021 11:58 PM] SnowPea#7485
You see on this one, you lock at 875mv, but its actually stuck at 787


[10/12/2021 12:02 AM] robot🤖armpits💪#2919
nice catch.  I locked that 1 at 775


[10/12/2021 12:03 AM] SnowPea#7485

[10/12/2021 8:28 AM] apexpool#3878
it's not working well on 3060ti, I have good results only on 3070ti with dual mining.


[10/12/2021 8:55 AM] andee#4722
but erg only is holding steady at 155?


[10/12/2021 8:55 AM] apexpool#3878
not very steady at 155, fluctuating between 153 and 155.


[10/12/2021 8:56 AM] apexpool#3878
with lhr unlock


[10/12/2021 8:56 AM] apexpool#3878
not dual mining.


[10/12/2021 8:57 AM] apexpool#3878
(now the card is on eth, all the others on erg)


[10/12/2021 8:58 AM] apexpool#3878
but I'll switch to dual mining on 3070ti cards and mine erg in cli with t-rex and the 3060ti card now, to test it again.


[10/12/2021 11:42 AM] apexpool#3878
first share after starting t-rex:
```20211012 12:41:38 [ OK ] 1/1 - 160.90 MH/s, 29ms ... GPU #0
```
so 160 MH/s is possible


[10/12/2021 11:42 AM] apexpool#3878
LHR kicks in immediately after that, of course.


[10/12/2021 12:22 PM] geezar#8187
Good numbers


[10/12/2021 12:45 PM] apexpool#3878
some good numbers, even if not optimal efficiency

[10/12/2021 1:25 PM] apexpool#3878
this is in cli


[10/12/2021 1:25 PM] geezar#8187
Does it report in pool and is stable?


[10/12/2021 1:26 PM] apexpool#3878
yes.


[10/12/2021 1:26 PM] apexpool#3878
another invalid share, probably mem OC is too high


[10/12/2021 1:26 PM] apexpool#3878
but a little lower I have 0 errors


[10/12/2021 1:26 PM] geezar#8187
I would run it for a few hours either way close to a 3070ti


[10/12/2021 1:27 PM] apexpool#3878
I started the tests 5 hours ago.


[10/12/2021 1:27 PM] geezar#8187
what are the clocks and reported core in miner?


[10/12/2021 1:28 PM] apexpool#3878
see the last screenshot


[10/12/2021 1:28 PM] geezar#8187
yes but the actual core the GPU has run at


[10/12/2021 1:28 PM] apexpool#3878
1545


[10/12/2021 1:28 PM] geezar#8187
or it holds at 1545 in miner?


[10/12/2021 1:28 PM] geezar#8187
at 110PL?


[10/12/2021 1:29 PM] apexpool#3878
no, PL is 115


[10/12/2021 1:29 PM] Ananas#9063
whats your core at?


[10/12/2021 1:29 PM] Ananas#9063
apex


[10/12/2021 1:29 PM] apexpool#3878
110 does not hold 1545, it fluctuates.

[10/12/2021 1:30 PM] geezar#8187
So shares are being submitted but high percentage due to the mem OC


[10/12/2021 1:30 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, I have to reduce mem clock to 8200 (2800 in hiveos)


[10/12/2021 1:30 PM] geezar#8187
Highest I've ran 3060 non TI was 2900 but 2800 around the max sensible clock


[10/12/2021 1:30 PM] apexpool#3878
I tried until 8300 (3000 in hiveos)


[10/12/2021 1:30 PM] geezar#8187
so basically a strong 155 MH/s should hold then


[10/12/2021 1:31 PM] apexpool#3878
so I must set in hiveos the mem clock, and then start t-rex in command line


[10/12/2021 1:31 PM] apexpool#3878
because t-rex cannot set mem clock


[10/12/2021 1:31 PM] apexpool#3878
in linux


[10/12/2021 1:32 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, it seems to hold 156.5 MH/s with 110w PL, 91.5 LHR, 1454 core clock locked and 2600 mem clock set in hiveos (only mem clock)


[10/12/2021 1:32 PM] geezar#8187
more efficient that 70ti and 80ti then


[10/12/2021 1:33 PM] geezar#8187
proof will be submitted shares over a period of time with those clocks - very impressive

Assume no higher works?


[10/12/2021 1:34 PM] apexpool#3878
now testing 91.9<>


[10/12/2021 1:35 PM] apexpool#3878
but it seems worse


[10/12/2021 1:35 PM] geezar#8187
I do not run any LHR commands on GDDR6X but as thats GDDR6 guessing you'll not get away with -1


[10/12/2021 1:36 PM] geezar#8187
So if you set the absolute value for core in Hive it does not offer the same performance - your setting the clocks via the CLI I see


[10/12/2021 1:36 PM] geezar#8187
out of interest if you do set everything in the GUI at the same clocks what was the result?


[10/12/2021 1:37 PM] apexpool#3878
correct. and you must set 0 in hive when testing in cli, otherwise it seems they interfere


[10/12/2021 1:37 PM] geezar#8187
nice find


[10/12/2021 1:37 PM] geezar#8187
so


[10/12/2021 1:37 PM] geezar#8187
Please, buy a Hynix and work your magic


[10/12/2021 1:37 PM] apexpool#3878
so only mem clock in hive for the card, the rest on 0


[10/12/2021 1:38 PM] apexpool#3878
if I find one at a good price, I will.


[10/12/2021 1:39 PM] apexpool#3878
it seems temperature is important again when pushing the limits


[10/12/2021 1:39 PM] apexpool#3878
55c seems optimal


[10/12/2021 1:39 PM] geezar#8187
I saw same process work on 460.39

using the smi Nvida tool (locking core)

@geezar did you guys find good values for 3060 ti dual mining?


[10/13/2021 2:37 PM] Attila#3944
I canceled my last 2 Zotac cards and ordered 2 Gigabyte 3060 tis instead


[10/13/2021 2:37 PM] Attila#3944
want to see if they indeed come with samsung ram


[10/13/2021 2:47 PM] apexpool#3878
they will

[10/13/2021 2:48 PM] Attila#3944
yeah, alternate.at said they'd deliver on Friday at the latest


[10/13/2021 2:48 PM] Attila#3944
wonder if they really will


[10/13/2021 2:49 PM] Attila#3944
extra 100 Euros but it will pay off


[10/13/2021 2:53 PM] geezar#8187
Currently Still testing - nothing more to report no offset, 1100-1400 locked core, 2000-2300 mem and PL varies from 115-123 so far. Anything over 133 needs too much power IMO

[10/13/2021 2:55 PM] geezar#8187
No need for LHR mode - just run disabled, very stable results on lolminer but power was 5w higher, however straight out of the box Lolminer 'just worked' - lower fee at 1.5% so may use that. We'll see how it goes, ETH pretty solid 42-42.5 MH/s


[10/13/2021 2:56 PM] geezar#8187
Using `470.74` Nvidia driver - not tested others yet


[10/13/2021 2:56 PM] geezar#8187
Ahh sorry @Ananas you were asking about dual - not tried since early tests were very poor IMO on Hynix anyway


[10/13/2021 3:03 PM] apexpool#3878
I switched to 465.31 and so far absolutely no difference compared to 460.91.03


[10/13/2021 3:06 PM] geezar#8187
Starting to think running it at 1100/2300/105PL is better 127 MH/s - low but reporting 100-101w which offsets the extra power needed to hit 135... not sure man 🤔


[10/13/2021 3:07 PM] geezar#8187
ETH for these seems better - I need to try dual again but very poor results and hour after hour the GPU is not mining 😦


[10/13/2021 3:07 PM] apexpool#3878
do you have some ETH settings for this?


[10/13/2021 3:08 PM] apexpool#3878
I did not test much, and what I tested was just above 30 MH/s


[10/13/2021 3:08 PM] geezar#8187
1350/2200/120PL was stable - let me confirm for ETH @apexpool

[10/13/2021 3:10 PM] geezar#8187
I will do same - meet in the middle


[10/13/2021 3:11 PM] geezar#8187
try `--lhr-tune 74.3`


[10/13/2021 3:19 PM] geezar#8187
dual remains 18 MH/s ETH - 80 MH/s ERG


[10/14/2021 2:29 PM] Attila#3944
this one card looks and feels pretty promising. where do I go from here?

@Attila mem in the 2-2200 range seems stable, start high with --lhr tune and let it come down to stabalize. That said, had great results with Lolminer too - good luck

would the sapphire settings work with the Asus rog being that they have the same mem?


[10/14/2021 7:45 PM] ABennabi#3974
for mem tweak is yours set to 20 or 30?


[10/14/2021 8:56 PM] Ananas#9063
20 for samsung elpida


[10/14/2021 8:56 PM] Ananas#9063
30 for others, as the hive info there says

no worries though, just turn off windows updates, DDU amd drivers


[10/15/2021 1:31 PM] Ananas#9063
then it will post.


[10/15/2021 1:31 PM] Ananas#9063
and then you can flash the original bios onto it


[10/15/2021 1:39 PM] CH#6305
no it wasnt....i have another card in with it its not detected in devices... so sad.. i will try ty. i flashed to vega 56 same card bios...pardon my noobness


[10/15/2021 1:39 PM] CH#6305
so is it saveable?

no exp with vega, but i bricked two 580s

dont think so


[10/15/2021 2:35 PM] Ananas#9063
try on HiveOS


[10/15/2021 2:35 PM] Ananas#9063
maybe linux will see the card


[10/15/2021 2:39 PM] CH#6305

[10/15/2021 2:43 PM] apexpool#3878
let us know what happens


[10/15/2021 3:07 PM] geezar#8187
Linux and DOS can be useful (if the GPU is detected in DOS/Linux you can use the CLI to recover (maybe)


[10/15/2021 3:22 PM] Ananas#9063
i was thinking the same as geezar, if HiveOS sees the card then you can flash it back


[10/15/2021 3:22 PM] Ananas#9063
it might not see it fully, but if it recognizes anything being there then it is flashable


[10/15/2021 3:22 PM] Ananas#9063
just make sure the BIOS switch is on the right position - on the ruined BIOS


[10/15/2021 3:23 PM] Ananas#9063
I'm pretty sure you can only flash the BIOS your card is currently switched to


[10/15/2021 3:23 PM] Ananas#9063
99% sure, although maybe @andee has other experience


[10/15/2021 9:11 PM] andee#4722
whoot, is that stable? 👀


[10/15/2021 9:12 PM] andee#4722
should be no problem to flash a bricked card as long as you have some other gpu to boot with


[10/15/2021 9:38 PM] geezar#8187
wondering same Polaris on 80 MH/s is impressive


[10/15/2021 10:01 PM] CH#6305
I switched the bios over to the bricked bios while I was in cmd amdflash and it reflashed the original bios fine 😁 thanks for your help everyone. I flashed the 56 version of the card I have and bricked it I will give it another go I’m guessing it was the wrong bios


[10/15/2021 10:02 PM] apexpool#3878
I was really curious if this is working, booting with the second bios, then switching to the first one and flashing the first one.


[10/15/2021 10:02 PM] apexpool#3878
are you 100% sure it worked? now both are working?

@SnowPea yes

1150 core clock, 1950 memclock, 850 core voltage? @geezar


[10/16/2021 9:46 AM] geezar#8187
yep - TBH I accepted 1050-1075/1950/850 most of the time - solid 65 MH/s - I like your hash better tho 🙂


[10/16/2021 9:46 AM] geezar#8187

Do you get invalid share or cuda illegal memory error?


[10/16/2021 5:18 PM] SnowPea#7485
Could be that the first one never get to 960mV even though you set it there, it was stuck at 935mV. It happened to me in msi ab when i used the curve editor, sometimes even if i locked the mV at a certain level, but the actual voltage never reach the locked number


[10/16/2021 5:55 PM] SnowPea#7485
I think i might have found the most optimal settings for my cards, although there are 2 invalid shares, its been up for 12 hrs without cuda error and the avg power consumption is 316w, max at 320w

I might try some Vega flashing then.


[10/17/2021 11:24 AM] apexpool#3878
I looked at your memory clocks settings you posted yesterday and tested some on my Vega cards


[10/17/2021 11:24 AM] Wolf9466#6211
Nooo... not unless it's a copied bios with no mods


[10/17/2021 11:24 AM] Wolf9466#6211
They enforce signatures


[10/17/2021 11:24 AM] apexpool#3878
not much improvement, bus one of them did something on the Samsung memory Vega56  card that I have.


[10/17/2021 11:25 AM] Wolf9466#6211
So you can flash a 56 -> 64, for example,  but not a modified one


[10/17/2021 11:25 AM] Wolf9466#6211
Also, are you tuning the memory timings?


[10/17/2021 11:26 AM] apexpool#3878
then I don't have what to test.


[10/17/2021 11:26 AM] apexpool#3878
yes, of course I am, the default amdmemtweak proposed settings in hiveos bring about 20MH/s


[10/17/2021 11:27 AM] Wolf9466#6211
Good.


[10/17/2021 11:27 AM] apexpool#3878
and on the Sapphire Pulse Vega56, changing the RFC249 to RFC420 brings another 1.5 MH/s


[10/17/2021 11:27 AM] Wolf9466#6211
What settings are those?


[10/17/2021 11:28 AM] apexpool#3878
for Hynix memory: ```amdmemtweak --RC 35 --RP 13 --RAS 22 --REF 65500 --RFC 148 --RRDL 4 --RRDS 4 --RCDRD 12 --RCDWR 4```

funny, I have 2 Hynix Vega56 cards, identical, but they react very different


[10/17/2021 11:29 AM] apexpool#3878
one works better with the Samsung settings


[10/17/2021 11:30 AM] apexpool#3878
and the other one has some invalid blocks from time to time.


[10/17/2021 11:30 AM] apexpool#3878
funny enough, it is a card that just came from Asus from a RMA


[10/17/2021 11:30 AM] apexpool#3878
it still had the plastic foil on it last week.


[10/17/2021 11:31 AM] apexpool#3878

the first one is identical, but older


[10/17/2021 11:32 AM] apexpool#3878
do you have any documentation on these timings?


[10/17/2021 11:34 AM] Wolf9466#6211
Very little, but here's a log from my own overclocking. Keep in mind, this HBM2 is Samsung Aquabolt (the same as is used in the Radeon VII), while the RX Vega 56/64/FE use the older Flarebolt.

[10/17/2021 11:36 AM] apexpool#3878
I saw that changing REF_PER in the last test brought a good improvement, but I cannot find it on the Vega56 cards


[10/17/2021 11:37 AM] Wolf9466#6211
REF_PER on the FPGA is REF on the Vega cards - it is just the refresh rate, but it's expressed in REF_PER - which is time_interval / tCK.

[10/17/2021 11:38 AM] Wolf9466#6211
also, you're running at 800Mhz, I'm running at 1200, our timings will differ due to this.


[10/17/2021 11:38 AM] Wolf9466#6211
Remember that timings, unless explicitly specified otherwise, are actually not units in nanoseconds or similar, but ticks of tCK - the memory clock.

{Reactions}
👍 

[10/17/2021 11:38 AM] apexpool#3878
847MHz seems to be the best value


[10/17/2021 11:39 AM] Wolf9466#6211
This effectively means that every time you change the memclock, the timings change ever so slightly (or not so slightly, depending on the memclk change)


[10/17/2021 11:39 AM] apexpool#3878
I believe decreasing RCDRD brings the most MH/s


[10/17/2021 11:41 AM] Wolf9466#6211
Besides REF, you mean? Yeah, it's one of the biggest. It's ACTIVATE command to READ command delay.


[10/17/2021 11:41 AM] apexpool#3878
not besides REF, from all.


[10/17/2021 11:41 AM] Wolf9466#6211
If you leave REF at stock, you'll be surprised how much of an effect it has :3


[10/17/2021 11:41 AM] Wolf9466#6211
Since Ergo is doing 32-byte small accesses, at random addresses, though - tRCDRD is a strong contender for most important timing


[10/17/2021 11:42 AM] Wolf9466#6211
because effectively, random addresses means you've basically no chance of hitting the same row twice, one directly after the other - it's just VERY improbable


[10/17/2021 11:43 AM] Wolf9466#6211
Because of the fact you may only have one row per bank activated, you need to close (PRECHARGE) that row before you do the next access within that bank.


[10/17/2021 11:44 AM] Wolf9466#6211
So, an ACTIVATE command is issued for a row, then tRCDRD clocks must happen BEFORE you are allowed to issue a READ from that row.


[10/17/2021 11:44 AM] Wolf9466#6211
This will happen REAL often, because as I said - random addressing.


[10/17/2021 11:44 AM] apexpool#3878
so it's faster memory access when tRCDRD is less


[10/17/2021 11:44 AM] Wolf9466#6211
Correct.


[10/17/2021 11:45 AM] Wolf9466#6211
This applies to Ergo more than it would for, say, Ethash. Don't get me wrong, it matters for Ethash, but not *quite* as much because it loads 128 bytes at a time.


[10/17/2021 11:46 AM] Wolf9466#6211
This means it gets to use the ability of the memory to "burst" read: it reads several 32 byte chunks from the same row, one after another. It does not have to PRECHARGE the row and ACTIVATE another - it just gets all 128 bytes.


[10/17/2021 11:47 AM] Wolf9466#6211
btw...


[10/17/2021 11:48 AM] Wolf9466#6211
having tFAW > tRRD * 4 makes little sense :3


[10/17/2021 11:48 AM] Wolf9466#6211
It's not harmful, just strange.


[10/17/2021 11:48 AM] apexpool#3878
it's the default


[10/17/2021 11:49 AM] Wolf9466#6211
*shrugs* It's not sensible, but it's okay.


[10/17/2021 11:49 AM] apexpool#3878
which RRD?


[10/17/2021 11:49 AM] apexpool#3878
```Timing 3:      RRDS: 3      RRDL: 3      RTP: 6```


[10/17/2021 11:50 AM] apexpool#3878
these 2?


[10/17/2021 11:50 AM] apexpool#3878
should tFAW be decreased, or RRD increased? @Wolf9466


[10/17/2021 11:51 AM] Wolf9466#6211
tFAW decreased by 1.


[10/17/2021 11:52 AM] Wolf9466#6211
The reason is, tFAW is Four Activate Window - it's a rolling window of clock cycles during which ONLY four ACTIVATE commands may be issued (remember, they all have to be to different banks!)


[10/17/2021 11:53 AM] Wolf9466#6211
Because tRRD is the amount of clocks you must wait between ACTIVATE'ing in one bank, and ACTIVATE'ing in another, 4 * tRRD is literally the most tFAW can be: this is because only four activates can take place during 4 * tRRD clocks.


[10/17/2021 11:54 AM] apexpool#3878
```Timing 3:      RRDS: 3      RRDL: 6      RTP: 5
Timing 4:      FAW: 12
```


[10/17/2021 11:54 AM] apexpool#3878
this is for the Samsung Vega56 card, as it's running now


[10/17/2021 11:54 AM] apexpool#3878
and default was ```Timing 3:      RRDS: 4      RRDL: 5      RTP: 5
Timing 4:      FAW: 13
```


[10/17/2021 11:54 AM] Wolf9466#6211
Ah, it was 13 because RRDL was 5


[10/17/2021 11:55 AM] Wolf9466#6211
and 4 * 4 is 16, 13 < 16, so makes sense (RRDS)


[10/17/2021 11:55 AM] Wolf9466#6211
you can leave FAW alone as your settings are - but the "default", IMO, should probably be corrected


[10/17/2021 11:55 AM] Wolf9466#6211
just cause it's a bad example


[10/17/2021 11:58 AM] apexpool#3878
you mean for the Hynix cards? where it should be 12 instead of 13? the last 2 values were for the Samsung card


[10/17/2021 11:59 AM] Wolf9466#6211
... I just scrolled up, and I swear I saw a post where tFAW > tRRD * 4, but... I can't find it now.


[10/17/2021 11:59 AM] Wolf9466#6211
Either I'm losing it, or I've been awake too long.


[10/17/2021 11:59 AM] Wolf9466#6211

[10/17/2021 12:00 PM] apexpool#3878

[10/17/2021 12:24 PM] Ananas#9063
out of the 7 GPUs I was able to run 4 of them stable, 3 cards have worse lottery so I reduced to 1250 core 1900 memory, and then I was able to drop their voltage by a ton to 940. this way they are stable


[10/17/2021 12:24 PM] Ananas#9063
as geezar mentioned, memory above 1900 barely changes anything, it's mostly about core for autolykos


[10/17/2021 12:25 PM] Ananas#9063
so just keep memory at 1900, then you just have to find the sweet spot of voltage and core clock depending on silicon

@Ananas thank you for sharing those OCs. They made me try to fine tune the RX 570, and the results are great so far. Still didn´t understood how to fine tune AMD cards... so different from Ndivia ones. What is the relation between CORE values and VDD?

The higher the VDD, the higher you are able to set the core clock without the card crashing

{Reactions}
👍 

[10/18/2021 5:31 AM] Ananas#9063
I try to stay around 950 VDD, then set the core as high as the card can go while still remaining stable


[10/18/2021 5:32 AM] Ananas#9063
This is usually between 1250-1325 core clock, depending on silicon


[10/18/2021 10:03 AM] Terremot#4855
Should I flash my vega 64 with the 56 BIOS.   Would it help increase hashrate?

[10/18/2021 11:59 AM] Ananas#9063
as in the card wont be able to boot 😄


[10/18/2021 12:52 PM] Terremot#4855
I'd just re-flash it again


[10/18/2021 1:12 PM] iamneo#3112
Need your support guys!!!


[10/18/2021 1:13 PM] iamneo#3112
So I am Dual Mining (ETH + ERG) under TREX Miner, LHR unlock


[10/18/2021 1:13 PM] iamneo#3112
My values are the ones i show on the picture

[10/18/2021 1:15 PM] iamneo#3112
Have no idea why Nanopool is showing values SO LOW and different from the ones i get on my Rig


[10/18/2021 1:15 PM] iamneo#3112
Is this normal at all???


[10/18/2021 1:15 PM] iamneo#3112
Or I am not seeing things correctly?


[10/18/2021 1:17 PM] iamneo#3112
no stale, or invalid shares, just low hash on their site.... and is the only pool I could put dual mining to work


[10/18/2021 1:29 PM] iamneo#3112
@Ananas @apexpool @robot🤖armpits💪 anyone?


[10/18/2021 1:30 PM] apexpool#3878
no idea why. I never used nanopool for mining erg.


[10/18/2021 1:31 PM] apexpool#3878
but when I mine dual, I see good values in the pool's website


[10/18/2021 2:20 PM] iamneo#3112
Which pool are you using?


[10/18/2021 2:20 PM] iamneo#3112
This one definitely has a problem


[10/18/2021 2:50 PM] CH#6305
Bottom one is vega 64 unflashed. I tried to flash twice but bricked twice… my bios stock file size was 512kb but every bios I found and flashed was 256kb I have a sapphire nitro + I just decided to use the extra 20 odd watts I seen an oc for 206 and 143 in windows on Facebook I’ll look for that and share

much much better


[10/18/2021 5:10 PM] Terremot#4855

[10/18/2021 5:26 PM] CH#6305
What did you use?


[10/18/2021 5:37 PM] Terremot#4855
just increased the mem clock to 980


[10/18/2021 5:37 PM] Terremot#4855
got a steady 182.8


[10/18/2021 5:38 PM] Terremot#4855
Ofc, it drops occasionally because it's rebuilding the DAG


[10/18/2021 5:47 PM] apexpool#3878
I guess RCDRD 12 will also help


[10/18/2021 5:49 PM] Terremot#4855
I guess....I don't know what it does


[10/18/2021 5:50 PM] apexpool#3878
I had a discussion with someone yesterday about it on this channel.

[10/18/2021 5:53 PM] Terremot#4855
wow...memory temps are nice too


[10/18/2021 5:54 PM] Terremot#4855
dropped by about 5°C


[10/18/2021 6:14 PM] CH#6305
That for 64s?


[10/18/2021 6:15 PM] apexpool#3878
both 56 and 64.


[10/18/2021 6:16 PM] apexpool#3878
you can also try 14, if 12 is not working (if you have errors)


[10/18/2021 6:16 PM] apexpool#3878
lower is better for hashrate.


[10/18/2021 6:59 PM] CH#6305

[10/18/2021 7:10 PM] Terremot#4855

[10/18/2021 7:10 PM] Terremot#4855

Hi all ! I was wondering about my vega 64. I wanted to push it higher.. i get around ~162 ish. I saw higher up on this channel some oc about a 64. I wonder if it could work with mine. I have the Powercolor one. Thanks in advance!

[10/20/2021 12:14 AM] 1ceRaven#8859
I tried stuff from the "readme" of trm but the miner never starts so i shift back to my original settings. Also, should i maybe flash it to a 56 with a right bios that corresponds maybe?


[10/20/2021 7:30 AM] apexpool#3878
are you using also the amdmemtweak to set the memory timings? they are essential if you want to improve the hashrate. hiveos has some good default values.


[10/20/2021 12:59 PM] 1ceRaven#8859
@apexpool thanks for your reply. Yes i'm using it. I will include a picture. Maybe i missed out on a small detail.  I get around ~164.7 mh as top speed for now.

[10/20/2021 1:02 PM] apexpool#3878
your core clock is much too low.


[10/20/2021 1:03 PM] apexpool#3878
you will want that as big as possible, but it will also increase power usage, and at some point you will have to increase the core voltage.


[10/20/2021 1:16 PM] 1ceRaven#8859
Oh i see! For the power, it does not matter. So, basically  the core clock i go up by 10 each time until i reach a stability?


[10/20/2021 1:16 PM] 1ceRaven#8859
I tried to oc it last summer but got tired playing around with it so i just left it as such until now.


[10/20/2021 1:21 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, something like that.


[10/20/2021 1:24 PM] 1ceRaven#8859
@apexpool awesome! Thanks for your help. I will look into it asap today :)

{Reactions}
👍 

[10/20/2021 1:26 PM] apexpool#3878
you will probably be able to go over 1400 with the Vega 64 cards, but the power usage will also be high.


[10/20/2021 1:26 PM] apexpool#3878
if it crashes, increase core voltage.


[10/20/2021 1:32 PM] 1ceRaven#8859
@apexpool good to know. I might try 1450 first and go from there..


[10/20/2021 1:32 PM] apexpool#3878
it will crash, most likely.


[10/20/2021 1:32 PM] 1ceRaven#8859
Probably, i was taking templates in hiveos


[10/20/2021 1:35 PM] 1ceRaven#8859
In your opinion, do you think i should play with the memory clock also?


[10/20/2021 1:36 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, increase gradually


[10/20/2021 1:37 PM] apexpool#3878
not steps of 10 if you want to be quicker, increase with 30 each time


[10/20/2021 1:37 PM] apexpool#3878
wait a minute or 2


[10/20/2021 1:37 PM] apexpool#3878
see the difference


[10/20/2021 1:37 PM] apexpool#3878
and increase again.


[10/20/2021 1:37 PM] apexpool#3878
when it crashes, increase the core clock and resume.


[10/20/2021 1:38 PM] apexpool#3878
you can also ssh to the machine and watch with "amd-info" what happens with the card.


[10/20/2021 1:40 PM] 1ceRaven#8859
Yes thanks. For now the miner does nothing. Still playing around :)


[10/20/2021 2:54 PM] geezar#8187
Vega's can run much less power and heat IMO - depends on goals - example 150 MH/s but pretty efficient (in reality 125w at the wall)

lower hash but lower power - all depends on the balance you need for the GPU

There will be a lot of GPU's going onto the market when those bills hit... peak time to sell perhaps late Q4!

Still tweaking, but at least it finally passed the 132 line


[10/20/2021 4:48 PM] geezar#8187
Key was keeping that mv as low as stable, 750mv was the limit I could find


[10/20/2021 4:48 PM] geezar#8187
awesome - what clocks did you end up with?


[10/20/2021 4:49 PM] geezar#8187
I moved it to ETH in the end - 143-146 was stable but same power sees 40-42 MH/s over on there so keeping it there for the moment


[10/20/2021 4:50 PM] SnowPea#7485
-502 for both cclock and mclock, but its super unstable


[10/20/2021 4:51 PM] geezar#8187
interesting... I ended up locking core to get it stable


[10/20/2021 4:52 PM] SnowPea#7485
Its weird that when the mclock was set to -502, and only -502, not -500, at lhr-tune 100, it will try to attempt 150mh


[10/20/2021 4:52 PM] SnowPea#7485
Then it kept failing and went all the way down to 89 or so to get to 136~137


[10/20/2021 4:53 PM] geezar#8187
Nothing changed since I posted my findings https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/859150558039244820/898275383596712006


[10/20/2021 4:53 PM] geezar#8187
still had a lot of success at LHR73 119w reported 145-147


[10/20/2021 4:54 PM] geezar#8187
never saw it do more - 40-42 on ETH but I know your not wanting to move it over 👍


[10/20/2021 4:54 PM] SnowPea#7485
I went back to 131~132mh at 108~111w, thats the most stable and efficient state


[10/20/2021 4:54 PM] geezar#8187
decent power too 👍


[10/20/2021 4:54 PM] geezar#8187
they are all different - just luck tbh


[10/20/2021 4:54 PM] SnowPea#7485

[10/20/2021 4:55 PM] geezar#8187

had a lot of luck with lolminer and equally T-Rex - work testing if you've not already


[10/20/2021 4:56 PM] SnowPea#7485
Ooh, i havent try lol


[10/20/2021 4:56 PM] geezar#8187
1.34 came out couple days back

Let me check it out

[10/20/2021 4:56 PM] geezar#8187
many praise it for being as close to 'real' hash without any inflated numbers going on - truth is DYOR and check the pool over a long test basically


[10/20/2021 4:57 PM] SnowPea#7485
Woo


[10/20/2021 4:58 PM] SnowPea#7485
You know, i saw something weird the other day, so my total hashrate was at 417mh, very stable, for a few days, but when i checked the pool, my avg hashrate for 6hrs was only 380mh


[10/20/2021 4:59 PM] geezar#8187
always a good test, range of factors there + some pools pay for stales, some do not - diff for the pool etc


[10/20/2021 5:00 PM] geezar#8187
The market + FUD + rage posts across a range of social channels will reflect in the nethash soon for sure... so your rewards will likely be going up haha


[10/20/2021 5:00 PM] SnowPea#7485
Ic, so i started tweaking my gpus again and got it up to 420mh total with a bit more power, then i checked the pool's avg hashrate after like 10hrs and it went back up to 420+


[10/20/2021 5:01 PM] SnowPea#7485
Thats the hope lol


[10/20/2021 5:04 PM] geezar#8187
Miners are seeing 40% daily profit over on ETH now with the dumping/pumping so we'll see how it pans out


[10/20/2021 5:09 PM] SnowPea#7485
I would hop to eth if i had more hash power, i only get ~130mh total on eth, so it'll take me about 10 days to get to the minimum payout


[10/20/2021 5:11 PM] geezar#8187
thought some pools offer a smaller payout - makes sense tho


[10/20/2021 5:18 PM] SnowPea#7485
I just felt like its a waste to put my 60ti lhr on eth with 30~35mh while i can do 132mh on erg


[10/20/2021 5:24 PM] geezar#8187
Pretty such you would see 40-42.. worth checking


[10/20/2021 5:28 PM] Herk#6019
at least 40mhs


[10/20/2021 5:28 PM] Herk#6019
shouldn't be below


[10/20/2021 5:28 PM] Herk#6019
and I think we're past 140mhs on erg also, shouldn't be below that either


[10/20/2021 6:19 PM] SnowPea#7485
Even for hynix?


[10/20/2021 6:20 PM] geezar#8187
Yep - 147 MH/s on ERG as I've shown (luck) and 40-42MH/s ETH


[10/20/2021 6:20 PM] geezar#8187
lhr 74 holds sometimes 75 - 40-42 (Hynix)


[10/20/2021 6:40 PM] SnowPea#7485
Yea, i mean not all hynix were made equally lol...if my max in erg is 132, i double the same card could go as high in eth as your hynix


[10/20/2021 6:45 PM] geezar#8187
Only way to tell is to test, you may be pleased


[10/20/2021 6:53 PM] apexpool#3878
I like these settings for lower power usage (Vega 56)

I could not bring them to 750mv so far, but I'll try in a different session again 🙂


[10/20/2021 7:31 PM] geezar#8187
try getting the soc down to 720 - nice numbers !


[10/20/2021 7:32 PM] geezar#8187
150 MH/s is a good balance IMO - no where near the top end but for the power/hash its a sweet spot 👍


[10/20/2021 7:32 PM] apexpool#3878
I did, but then the mem clock also drops to 615


[10/20/2021 7:32 PM] apexpool#3878
strange


[10/20/2021 7:34 PM] geezar#8187
try dropping your mem to 701 - I run 1090/701


[10/20/2021 7:35 PM] 1ceRaven#8859
My vega 64 draws around 128w atm


[10/20/2021 7:36 PM] 1ceRaven#8859

eth?


[10/20/2021 7:39 PM] geezar#8187
Yea we were chatting about his low 132 Hash, on ETH may be better if unable to hit higher (147)


[10/20/2021 7:39 PM] geezar#8187
Curious if he can achieve that - maybe just lucky with this Hynix GPU


[10/20/2021 7:40 PM] geezar#8187
Same GPU on ERG lhr 95 can achieve 145-147 119w


[10/20/2021 7:40 PM] geezar#8187
ETH 116w-123w

I havent try yet, still trying to stablize my rig, somehow im still getting random crashes every now and then, some times crashes after 3 hrs, some times 20 hrs


[10/20/2021 10:02 PM] SnowPea#7485
Ive already tune down the memory overclock a lot...(non lhr 3060ti 1280 mclock, lhr 3060ti 980 mclock, 3060 1280 mclock)


[10/20/2021 10:04 PM] geezar#8187
pushing past 2000 (1000 windows) no point IMO - stable only for a couple hours 2100/2200 - 1600-1800 range (800 Windows) - for sure once dialled in they sit stable


[10/20/2021 10:05 PM] SnowPea#7485
Oh? do you mean the lhr 3060ti? or all?


[10/20/2021 10:06 PM] SnowPea#7485
My 3060 had the most crashes


[10/20/2021 10:07 PM] geezar#8187
Sorry Hynix 60ti


[10/20/2021 10:07 PM] geezar#8187
3060 is V1 or V2?


[10/20/2021 10:07 PM] SnowPea#7485
Yea, that one cant get past 1000, 980 is what i have


[10/20/2021 10:08 PM] SnowPea#7485
3060 v2


[10/20/2021 10:08 PM] SnowPea#7485

[10/20/2021 10:12 PM] geezar#8187

[10/20/2021 10:12 PM] SnowPea#7485
Lets see if it crashes


[10/20/2021 10:12 PM] SnowPea#7485
I got it to 120mh with 95w yesterday


[10/20/2021 10:12 PM] geezar#8187

[10/20/2021 10:12 PM] SnowPea#7485
But crashed after 13 hrs


[10/20/2021 10:13 PM] SnowPea#7485
And after the first crash, if i dont do anything about it, it will keep crashing


[10/20/2021 10:13 PM] geezar#8187
comparison - around 100w I see 125 MH/s

thing is.... 62 MH/s ETH on that GPU or 170 MH/s ERG 🤔


[10/20/2021 10:16 PM] geezar#8187
Damn nice GPU


[10/20/2021 10:17 PM] SnowPea#7485
Yes, this HP 60ti is really nice


[10/20/2021 10:17 PM] geezar#8187
$4.51 V $2.98 - all relative tho


[10/20/2021 10:18 PM] geezar#8187
1/3 more profitable 'today' on that GPU over on ETH


[10/20/2021 10:18 PM] SnowPea#7485
Well, im hodling erg for now, so when i sell it, it'll probably be at higher price


[10/20/2021 10:18 PM] geezar#8187
yep


[10/20/2021 10:19 PM] SnowPea#7485
I hope the price and diff stay low for now so i can get more erg


[10/20/2021 10:19 PM] SnowPea#7485
And the diff just went above 3 today, with this low price, people should be leaving to eth


[10/21/2021 8:10 AM] andee#4722
will probably see a small drop today, seems like there are ~20TH of loyal miners


[10/21/2021 8:20 AM] geezar#8187
Yep - the differential on the basis of 50MH/s v 125 MH/s (broad brush) has gone up $0.31 in favour of ETH from yesterday tho


[10/21/2021 8:20 AM] geezar#8187
$3.66 v $2.10 - a $1.56 incentive per day (today) we'll see if the diff and nethash settle


[10/21/2021 8:33 AM] andee#4722
I will actually switch my 8gig rig today, a little eth unpaid at the pool, might as well contribute a little to the diff drop for my 4 gig 😄

@geezar is 26-27 max on 1070's now? I remember it as hashing higher years back 🤔


[10/21/2021 8:56 AM] andee#4722
the Ti's were around 33, now at 30..-31.3


[10/21/2021 8:56 AM] geezar#8187
I was messing with 1080ti.... man.... 55 MH/s seems a long way back... sure max I got was 37


[10/21/2021 8:56 AM] geezar#8187
same for 70's - make sure use --mt and mess with the clocks - I was shocked too TBH


[10/21/2021 10:07 AM] apexpool#3878
but I guess you also have to sell to see the difference. if you hold eth and eth price decreases in 3 months with 50%, but erg only with 25%, the difference might be less or non-existent.


[10/21/2021 10:13 AM] andee#4722
I will trade it for erg right away 🙂


[10/21/2021 10:14 AM] apexpool#3878
what's the best way to exchange eth for erg?

have to sell for stablecoin/btc then buy 😦 would be nice with a trading pair

I tend to keep gas fees as low as possible - just the way I do it, worked out pretty well so far - ETH is best kept as a long play TBH 10-15k likely EOY


[10/21/2021 10:51 AM] geezar#8187

40%+ incentive is a compelling one (I still choose to mine ETH + ERG but many will not)

[10/24/2021 3:49 PM] geezar#8187
That incentive is getting wider - 8GB RX580 with 32MH/s will yield $2.12 - same GPU will yield $1.01 with 70 MH/s - diff should drop hopefully > 50% benefit (daily profit) buying back into ERG makes a lot of sense 🙂


[10/25/2021 4:54 PM] andee#4722
can I get more than 42-43.8MH on ethash with my hynix 3060ti?

Minor change in my rig 😄 flipped all my Hynix cards and sourced 12 Gigabyte brand cards with Samsung RAM. Last one is still shipping. Spent weeks managing this. Conclusions: batch of 3 OC Eagles from Cyberport seem to be very power-hungry. There is one Gaming OC Pro from the 3.0 LHR generation, that one has an 8+6 pin power supply, that one is also hungry. Some Eagles can do 150-152MH/s at 110W. Will have to figure out what works for each one. Also, I could sell all my Hynix cards used at a higher price point when compared to what I bought them at a month ago. All in all, the upgrade barely cost a couple hundred Euros. Hashrate increase is 15-20% at this point.

Also if you guys have any decent setting that could reduce power usage please let me know 🙂


[10/29/2021 10:45 AM] geezar#8187
@Attila nice work - I've settled for 145-147 at 115-120w for the Hynix but Samsung for sure is king

[10/29/2021 10:48 AM] geezar#8187
Nice work - Hynix runs 44-45 MH/s on ETH with NB so at least can do something OK 🙂


[10/29/2021 10:49 AM] Attila#3944
Yep 🙂 I focus on Ergo so that was the consideration. Flip as long as I can

I'm not sure the amdmemtweaks I have are good, never mind the overclocks


[10/30/2021 1:53 PM] apexpool#3878
how much power for this hashrate and which LHR level?


[10/30/2021 1:53 PM] apexpool#3878
I was able to get to 42.5 with 130 PL in NBminer with my Zotac card (Hynix).


[10/30/2021 2:08 PM] geezar#8187
@apexpool still on ERG 147 MH/s but checking ETH again just now

settles down between 44-45 - 1450-1500 core + 2000-2200 mem - see what works as ever as you know a lot of testing is needed but lhr 74 is stable - anything higher 'luck' depending on core clock


[10/30/2021 2:09 PM] geezar#8187
back to ERG to enjoy the low diff for now however


[10/30/2021 2:10 PM] geezar#8187
in fact try 1515. Good luck

up the mem as high as it will hold and increase core 1500+

1500/7900 as above 44+

I've spend most of the night trying to tune the cards


[10/30/2021 4:05 PM] Terremot#4855
Tried the tweak.  It lets me increase the core clock for zero increase in hash rate

you should be able to do more with much lower power

very different

[10/30/2021 5:09 PM] apexpool#3878
look at the power at you and me


[10/30/2021 5:09 PM] apexpool#3878
you need to stop the miner


[10/30/2021 5:09 PM] apexpool#3878
when you do such big changes


[10/30/2021 5:09 PM] Terremot#4855
yeah, almost half the power


[10/30/2021 5:09 PM] apexpool#3878
otherwise it will crash


[10/30/2021 5:10 PM] apexpool#3878
my memory straps are very little different from the suggested ones from hiveos for Vega 56 with Hynix and Samsung


[10/30/2021 5:10 PM] apexpool#3878
I tested many hours, every card is different


[10/30/2021 5:11 PM] apexpool#3878
the first 2 cards are the same model, but they are very different when mining


[10/30/2021 5:11 PM] apexpool#3878
the first one is older, but takes OC much better


[10/30/2021 5:12 PM] apexpool#3878
but it is running with 12c warmer at the hottest point (TJct)


[10/30/2021 5:12 PM] apexpool#3878
probably needs repadding


[10/30/2021 5:12 PM] Terremot#4855

[10/30/2021 5:44 PM] Terremot#4855

[10/30/2021 6:39 PM] apexpool#3878
you can increase in very small steps


[10/30/2021 6:39 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, this is what happens when the voltage is too low


[10/30/2021 6:40 PM] apexpool#3878
I had good results with 756, 762, 787, 793


[10/30/2021 6:41 PM] apexpool#3878
I only tried over 800 when testing the limits, but never during 24/7 mining.


[10/30/2021 8:10 PM] geezar#8187
Try dropping the mem further also 1080 to 1090 core will help get that power down


[10/30/2021 8:10 PM] geezar#8187
743-750mv works well 1090-1095


[10/30/2021 8:12 PM] geezar#8187
75w-85w range (reported) for Hynix and Samsung - ran for many months now - cool and low power


[10/30/2021 8:21 PM] geezar#8187
Samsung

For 200 it would cost much more power, I think 150 is a good compromise on the Vegas


[10/30/2021 8:27 PM] geezar#8187
Samsung will hold as low as 725mv but not for long - 743-750mv other than Gigabytes that seem to need 756 so increments in the 800-793-787-781-775-768-862-756 etc until it's stable - they all differ but can run cool and low power with some patience


[10/30/2021 9:08 PM] Terremot#4855

power is higher in reality at AMD


[10/30/2021 9:24 PM] geezar#8187
Gigabyte Vegas generally report the accurate power - my example reports 135w same overall hash/clocks give or take as GPU's reporting 75-85w so unless Gigabyte add 40w+ onto that number


[10/30/2021 9:33 PM] Terremot#4855
I wasn't aware


[10/30/2021 9:33 PM] Terremot#4855
but still a decent power/hash ratio nowadays


[10/31/2021 1:04 AM] $aX#5658

W/ trex miner?


[10/31/2021 4:35 AM] Kogo#3611
Which miner are you using?
I'm using t-rex for my 3060ti Hynix. The best I can get is 135 with 1350/2300.


[10/31/2021 7:54 AM] geezar#8187
T-Rex - many GPUs seem to only manage 132-134. For those ETH is a good option TBH


[10/31/2021 7:55 AM] geezar#8187
Your mem is holding very high - perhaps try increasing core 1500-1550 range


[10/31/2021 8:34 AM] Kogo#3611
I tried to increase 15 core from 1300 ~ 1600, start from 1400, the hash doesn't increase.


[10/31/2021 8:37 AM] Kogo#3611
for my 3060ti, it seems 135mh/s is 100% hashrate
because if I use lhr-tune 80 or 90%, the hash is 80, 90% of 135...


[10/31/2021 8:57 AM] geezar#8187
yep they all differ - LHR 95 was a sweet spot for me hence the bump in hash

[11/01/2021 5:59 PM] geezar#8187
Apex has his Samsung running well - as for the Hynix - see if you can hold higher locked core - 1450-1515 works well - lhr mode 95 was sweet spot for mine.


[11/01/2021 6:01 PM] Rafael The Hutt#8935
¿¿¿ im newbie , can you explain to me simply, thx 😉


[11/01/2021 6:02 PM] geezar#8187
So for the Hynix - try to increase the locked core value from 1350 to 1450 initially and test. If its stable try for 1500

--lhr-tune   value in T-Rex also aim for 90-95 (all GPU's differ) but on ERG this was a good setting (stable) it varies but 145-147 give or take for 118w

@ercovero Just had a quick look at the 80ti. lot more power but NB for sure looks good. This is 1150/2200 so a lot of scope to crank her up to around 90 MH/s - in terms of profit per day a clear $3 but we'll see.

asic temp 55c and Junction 65c on open air frame. running 1150 locked and 2200 (1100 in windows) so must be a lot of scope for these - could explain the price hike on 80ti's with each interation of the miners pushing beyond 74%...

Getting better! You can probably go higher if you give it more power. 140 or so. Your cards says it can take 264w, give it at least half, so 132

In terms of efficiency, do you think it compensates that 1Mhs more than the other 3060ti to change the OC?

[11/07/2021 2:48 PM] Terremot#4855
you need to do a higher core clock to get a better hashrate now


[11/07/2021 2:49 PM] apexpool#3878
I know, but I don't want to use more power.


[11/07/2021 2:51 PM] apexpool#3878
it was 166, 159, 159 until this morning with the same settings.


[11/07/2021 2:53 PM] Terremot#4855
I was getting 197, 180 and 178 with my most recent settings


[11/07/2021 2:53 PM] Terremot#4855
was down to 140mhs on my 197mhs card


[11/07/2021 2:55 PM] Terremot#4855
might as well have a 3060Ti LHR


[11/07/2021 2:56 PM] apexpool#3878
3060ti is much more efficient now.


[11/07/2021 2:57 PM] Terremot#4855
yup


[11/07/2021 2:57 PM] Terremot#4855
they will improve hashrate in the next release


[11/07/2021 2:57 PM] Terremot#4855
this was an emergency release


[11/07/2021 3:02 PM] Terremot#4855
with my hynix 3060Ti, I am getting 132.4mhs for 115W


[11/07/2021 3:02 PM] Terremot#4855
which is still not power efficient, but better

RX580 responds well with 1200/1950/875 I've found - increasing the core will get you into early 70's but at more power - --REF 30 works well. In the past I've played with many many tweak settings but generally REF is the most important


[11/10/2021 2:57 PM] geezar#8187
On windows I always used overdriveNT for the clocks - worth considering too

oh I have memories of overdriveNT from 2017...same GPU but it was on eth back then

is overdrivetool better than amd memory tweak?


[11/11/2021 10:37 AM] geezar#8187
I know, same here 🙂 Overdrivetool is just a different way to control the fan/clocks - you can do the same natively in the tweaker but depending on the AMD drivers I used sometimes the fans would not play ball - imagine now its probably just an overhead. I used to run a bat file to apply the tweaks + the overdrivent clocks at boot time with a delay allowing the miner to start then adding the tweaks. Windows was a hassle but with some effort can be automated/stable


[11/11/2021 12:32 PM] Agent.Benny#2624

Just received a 3080TI FE. Managed to overclock it to 249.5 Mhs.  Anyone managed to get it to about 270?


[11/12/2021 10:59 AM] geezar#8187
Not FE but` 1590/2200/220` should give you 268 MH/s around 220w, 280 and above cost me more power around 230w but up to you on pushing harder - FE perhaps may offer you lower power 👍

also I noticed that your driver versions and afterburner version are slightly newer then mine, will that cause any problems?


[11/17/2021 5:42 PM] Telefragged#8068
From what I noticed the latest driver made the LHR kick in sooner so might be better to have a slightly older one. That's why I locked the core clock. Not sure about afterburner version, as long as the card is supported it should be fine


[11/17/2021 5:43 PM] Telefragged#8068
Also there is a pinned comment here with a spreadsheet where you can look up other people's OC

also what's your eff/watt looking like?


[11/18/2021 12:44 AM] Telefragged#8068
Roughly 1.1mH/w efficiency and no particular reason for the 0.825. Could probably go lower if you want to fine tune it, might be able to increase efficiency too if you mess around with voltage / power limit or manage to run faster memory clocks.

1590/3200/220 works well for many 268 MH/s.


[11/19/2021 7:02 AM] geezar#8187
Potentially PL 230 depending on GPU


[11/19/2021 1:23 PM] Jester#8982
Nice, I haven't messed with mine much but I managed a stable 261MH/s, having trouble with my core clock because it seems like if the memory gets disproportionately higher like putting the core 
 clock into negative, it gets real unstable which is probably lhr kicking in or somethin (just a guess), it drops my hashes by about 50% and fluctuates in a range of about 20~40MH/s


[11/19/2021 2:10 PM] geezar#8187
I've found those clocks to be pretty consistent - 1590-1595 locked core - mem 3200-3400 - but results will vary - higher power will yield 281 MH/s from my testing but your results may vary. PL 220 -230 seems to be a good place


[11/19/2021 2:21 PM] Jester#8982
where are you grabbing your memory clock from?


[11/19/2021 2:38 PM] geezar#8187
On Windows the mem would I expect be more in the 1500-1600 range.


[11/19/2021 2:39 PM] geezar#8187
One is happy with 220 PL one 230 - they all differ

was going for a decently high hashrate that has good efficiency, currently I'm getting a stable 250mh/s not going crazy with the settings, it's being real stable here so I'm reluctant to change it

The only way to get a good rate is by experimentation and crashing your rig a lot

[11/21/2021 12:17 AM] Jester#8982
I managed to get it to sit at ~269 with a good efficiency but it was only stable for about a couple hrs then it started fluctuation from 100~200


[11/21/2021 12:18 AM] Terremot#4855
That's lhr kicking in


[11/21/2021 12:18 AM] Terremot#4855
My settings are 1820 core clock and 2800 mem clock


[11/21/2021 12:19 AM] Terremot#4855

What's the best setting for palit 3060 ti LHR Hynix?Only get 80mh/s with the setting +0 core +1100mem PL80 (T-Rex)


[11/22/2021 9:08 AM] apexpool#3878
try T-rex core clock 1320 / mem clock 2200 / power limit 115w / lhr-tune 100


[11/22/2021 9:09 AM] apexpool#3878
and: core clock -400, the rest of the settings unchanged.

For 3070 LHR, what is the hashrate? Is it the same or different 🙏


[12/06/2021 6:21 AM] Terremot#4855
3070 Lhr usually gets around 155mhs. More with the unlock modes but I'm not entirely sure how much


[12/06/2021 11:49 AM] Paincakes#1028
Hey guys, newbie here, I would like some help, I've checked the google calc but I'm far from having the same result, currently on my EVGA 3060 TI LHR, with OC settings: 55% PL, -502 Core Clock, +1100 Memory Clock, I've only 80 mh/s instead of the 130... any idea or lead I should look into?


[12/06/2021 12:11 PM] Paincakes#1028
Ok so LHR affect ergo a bit, with t-rex it's working well


[12/06/2021 1:11 PM] geezar#8187
Samsung will perform better around 150-158 MH/s  region, Hynix commonly 133 MH/s to 148 MH/s depending on the quality of the GPU on this algo. with reasonable power consumption 115-122w reported being common for Hynix, Samsung will hold lower


[12/06/2021 1:19 PM] Paincakes#1028
Yeah I'm currently at 145mh/s with 92.5% LHR unlock, I just didn't thought LHR can affect other algo than etash


[12/06/2021 2:39 PM] geezar#8187
Good results if thats a Hynix?


[12/06/2021 2:40 PM] geezar#8187
A common mistonception for some time that only ETHASH impacted yep.

Yeah, it does affect ergo, but nowhere near as badly as ethash


[12/06/2021 4:59 PM] Paincakes#1028

[12/06/2021 4:59 PM] Paincakes#1028
not sure, how can I check it?


[12/06/2021 5:14 PM] geezar#8187
If in Windows use GPU-Z @Paincakes


[12/06/2021 5:16 PM] geezar#8187
lots of other tools but this is a good utility to check lots of sensors and monitor the health etc

thanks a bunch, I got Hynix then 👍


[12/06/2021 10:17 PM] geezar#8187
That’s good hash for Hynix then. Try your PL around 115-120w with 1400/2100 -LHR 96.6 was a sweet spot but they all differ 👍🏻


[12/06/2021 10:49 PM] andee#4722
I seem to be the only one not able to get any more speed out the hynix  🤔


[12/07/2021 9:59 AM] geezar#8187
No I have one that maxes out (regardless on lhr settings/offset or locked core...) 133 MH/s - and one that can achieve max 151 MH/s but more comfortable 144 MH/s for weeks - so there is a split in the quality / BIOS revisions for sure - some will hit 132-133 some manage much higher - both will achieve 44 MH/s on ETH however - go figure


[12/07/2021 10:06 AM] andee#4722
I will probably just sell it, electricity is so expensive now and the efficiency is not very top notch. ~352kH/W on 3060ti and ~310 on my 1070ti's on ethash🤔


[12/07/2021 10:41 AM] geezar#8187
Yep - demand is high so good time to sell


[12/13/2021 1:47 PM] TheFernando88#1523
Hello everyone, I'm new here.

I'm mining with around 5-6GH/s, I have 17x3070 and 13 x 3070ti -> all LHR cards

I currently get with with the 3070 -> arround 150-155mh/s and with the 3070ti -> 180-188mh/s. Some cards hit 188 some 180

are these good hashrates or is more possbile?
mining with t-rex and hiveos


[12/13/2021 2:31 PM] apexpool#3878
they are very good for the 3070ti cards. I cannot tell for 3070, because I dont' have any.
what power usage do you have for 180 - 188 MH/s?


[12/13/2021 2:32 PM] TheFernando88#1523
I had OC 3800 on the first card, but one card is keeping crashing, I'm now setting it more down

my best result, but just for tests, I am running with lower power consumption now.


[12/13/2021 2:36 PM] TheFernando88#1523
I think you need to go up with the power, then the hasrate will go up

I also using t-rex and lhr-tune -> 98


[12/13/2021 2:37 PM] TheFernando88#1523
on some cards its very stable, 2 cards making problems with heat, memclock, and LHR unlock.


[12/13/2021 2:37 PM] apexpool#3878
no, the lhr kicks in if I increase the power. but I don;t want to use more power, it is much too expensive for me.


[12/13/2021 3:54 PM] andee#4722
40W for 5-6MH is a pretty bad deal if you are situated in or around Europe. if you have free or very cheap power, sure go for it. I was in that situation before the winter arrived 🤣

[12/14/2021 5:58 AM] TheFernando88#1523
Yeah Inwill go further down, also to have more stable rigs, testing right now.


[12/14/2021 5:58 AM] TheFernando88#1523
How to check if I have LHR v1 or v2? Where I can check this?


[12/14/2021 10:13 AM] Terremot#4855
You're better off using fixed core clock settings.  you can then fine tune the cards and use less power


[12/14/2021 10:13 AM] TheFernando88#1523
Yeah put -715 in hive os


[12/14/2021 10:14 AM] Terremot#4855
I mean using the absolute clock value, not an offset


[12/14/2021 11:07 AM] Terremot#4855
anyone going for max hashrate and not looking at power efficiency on a 3080Ti, here is the highest rate I could on two different cards and the power usage on each

essentially core clock set to 1800 and mem clock to 2830


[12/14/2021 11:08 AM] Terremot#4855
if you're forcing P0 state, you can take 500 off the mem clock


[12/14/2021 11:09 AM] Terremot#4855
and if you're using the latest evga bios, you'll probably need to take 500 off the absolute core clock setting too

what change did you make?


[12/17/2021 6:49 PM] Boldimore#5357
Memory  was increased to 3000. Reduced memory back to 2500 and core locked 1650, hash fell to 110 per card. will try to find the ideal core clock


[12/17/2021 6:51 PM] Terremot#4855
Then when you've got a good core clock then play with mem clock


[12/17/2021 6:51 PM] Boldimore#5357
Could I have triggered some kind of LHR by increasing memory so much while the miner was running?


[12/17/2021 6:51 PM] Terremot#4855
100% chance

{Reactions}
👍🏻 

[12/17/2021 6:52 PM] Boldimore#5357
Gonna try again


[12/17/2021 8:16 PM] Boldimore#5357
Seems like, when using locked core, I can only get up to 1540 core before triggering lhr. Memory of 3000 is around the peak hash power. Tried 3500 memory, system freezes. Now gonna try the clocks from the guy above, with offset core


[12/17/2021 8:42 PM] Terremot#4855
depends on the cards.  Some cards might have problems with such a high memory clock


[12/17/2021 8:42 PM] Terremot#4855
but you never know


[12/17/2021 8:54 PM] Boldimore#5357
I won't be using core offsets. They are getting 178 to 180 each(wow), but one locks and stays at 108. Together with the much bigger power consumption the bigger hash becomes useless, for me it is really bad to use offsets.


[12/17/2021 8:54 PM] Terremot#4855
offsets to me use far too much power

Funnily it was the lhr setting where I could gain a few MH/s. I used to have it on 74, then 75 and it stepped back to 74. Now starting on 77 it goes back to 75.5

[12/18/2021 7:07 PM] Herk#6019
I mean the jump isn't occasional enough


[12/18/2021 7:07 PM] Herk#6019

[12/18/2021 7:10 PM] Herk#6019
sure, just wanted to point that out as 150W would be great, also 3000 on mem doesn't seem to work on all sadly, most 3070ti FEs manage to get up there and rarely some suprim x ones but everything else I had (quite a few models) just die

[12/30/2021 2:08 AM] netocanastra#3619
I just got a Vega 56 Samsung memory .The max hash I was able to get is 128mh I tried some overclocking settings but did not work. Any tips. Run on windows 10


[12/30/2021 6:37 AM] Attila#3944
Mine eth with it and buy ergo off the profits. Vegas have been gimped a month or so ago on erg

Hi any oc settings for dell 3080 ti? Micron memory, but memclock  above 1000 will keep failed extranonce

Its my brother's pc in the US, currently trying mining using NH


[01/02/2022 3:16 AM] DukeHG#6485
He did find setting that could reach 240+mh but soon keep showing failed extranonce

Might make sense to flash a 3090 bios on it, mine eth into btc and buy erg from that

Only on Dell and Alienware cards though


[01/09/2022 9:31 PM] Attila#3944
This also implies that the Dell 80ti is just a subpar 3090 rebranded so it might make sense to look for 3090 OC settings

sometimes my first share will have a high hash rate but thtas it


[01/12/2022 4:39 AM] ÅrÖhBê#8289
If on Hive try -503cc with 2800mem   Can also try 1300cc 2800mem    

Windows -503 on core 1300-1400mem 

Leave your power limit alone to start then adjust downward to balance your hashrate/power


[01/12/2022 4:40 AM] Deleted User#0000

can any 3080Ti be flashed with the EVGA 3080Ti BIOS?


[01/14/2022 10:09 PM] Terremot#4855
On Windows, use a HDMI dummy, then have either an animated screensaver or run a video constantly


[01/14/2022 10:09 PM] Terremot#4855
you should get around 130mhs


[01/14/2022 10:10 PM] Terremot#4855
more likely 110-125mhs


[01/15/2022 3:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Wtf


[01/21/2022 7:05 AM] Deathmumi#1369
v1 3060 can do 125mhs while v2 doing 120mhs


[01/21/2022 7:06 AM] Deathmumi#1369
if you use v2 then try 1580mhz cclk 2500+ mem lhr 97


[01/21/2022 7:06 AM] Deathmumi#1369
generally it will go like 118 119 120


[01/21/2022 7:07 AM] Deathmumi#1369
if pl so much then only change 1480mhz cclk so this way it will get 116 117 but more eco friendly and cooler cards


[01/21/2022 10:29 AM] blackinsecure#3693
at what powers:


[01/21/2022 10:44 AM] Deathmumi#1369
PL not matters put 120 but it will draw need wattage


[01/21/2022 10:45 AM] Deathmumi#1369
it's not calculating direct 120w


[01/21/2022 10:45 AM] Deathmumi#1369
if your card will pull 115w it will shown like that over there


[01/21/2022 10:46 AM] Deathmumi#1369
if you need economical go 1480mhz cclk so it may pull under 100w


[01/21/2022 10:46 AM] Deathmumi#1369
i have many 90 93 95 97w pullling cards depends on silicone


[01/26/2022 6:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
@Deathmumi any locks?


[01/26/2022 6:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
i dont. i use regular 3060 non lhr


[01/26/2022 6:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
what do i use


[01/26/2022 6:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
for the past 2 weeks ive been using just a power limit


[01/26/2022 6:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
58%


[01/26/2022 6:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
which has helped keep them at around 100 average each


[01/26/2022 6:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
which is ok but id like to bump it up have it more consistent


[01/26/2022 7:27 AM] Deathmumi#1369
i have both v1 and v2 . so if you have v1 non lhr ones you can setup around 850mv by your cards also like 1260mhz core enough, vmem must be high as possible


[01/26/2022 7:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
i have v1 non lhr


[01/26/2022 7:31 AM] Deleted User#0000

[01/26/2022 7:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
was manually oveerclocking before this is way better


[01/26/2022 7:41 AM] Deathmumi#1369
Yeah minivolt i mean


[01/26/2022 7:42 AM] Deathmumi#1369
You can afterburner curve for setup bring dot equal 1260mhz while mv around 850mv


[01/26/2022 7:43 AM] Deathmumi#1369
This will lock speed while you have enough power to get max hash. You need to try dots spot which depend on you cards silicone quality


[01/26/2022 8:02 AM] Deleted User#0000

so idk


[01/26/2022 8:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
then when i get the tweaked settings (-502 core, +1250 mem, 58% power level, auto fans), i get like 100-110


[01/26/2022 8:51 AM] Deathmumi#1369
this is general setting


[01/26/2022 8:51 AM] Deathmumi#1369
you need to find your spot voltage point

[01/26/2022 9:02 AM] Deathmumi#1369
go in curve


[01/26/2022 9:02 AM] Deathmumi#1369
so next you will apply something like under


[01/26/2022 9:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
So keep current settings? Since it’s better


[01/26/2022 9:03 AM] Deathmumi#1369
do you see my card spot point 800mv


[01/26/2022 9:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
1350 mem, 63% pl


[01/26/2022 9:03 AM] Deathmumi#1369
that depends silicone quality


[01/26/2022 9:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
Then open curve?


[01/26/2022 9:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
How do I determine quality


[01/26/2022 9:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
Of silicone 😂


[01/26/2022 9:03 AM] Deathmumi#1369
man you can' t directly get same like i showed you


[01/26/2022 9:03 AM] Deathmumi#1369
you need to find your cards spot point


[01/26/2022 9:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah I’m saying show me


[01/26/2022 9:03 AM] Deathmumi#1369
each will suffer different scores


[01/26/2022 9:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
How to find the sweet spot


[01/26/2022 9:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or how to test this


[01/26/2022 9:04 AM] Deathmumi#1369
i gave you sample screen


[01/26/2022 9:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
Optimally


[01/26/2022 9:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
That didn’t help but ok


[01/26/2022 9:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
I’ll look into it


[01/26/2022 9:04 AM] Deathmumi#1369
so you need to drop each dots


[01/26/2022 9:04 AM] Deathmumi#1369
if you cant recieve enough power to feed that core mhz than you need to give more like 825 850 875 900mv


[01/26/2022 9:05 AM] Deathmumi#1369
normally curve not like this straigh line you see over there what i apllied give same mhz for core to stop card pulling more voltage


[01/26/2022 9:06 AM] Deathmumi#1369
so even if i apply %100 power limit card cant go much more what 800mv pulling


[01/26/2022 9:06 AM] Deathmumi#1369
this is expert tweaking


[01/26/2022 9:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah I can tell


[01/26/2022 9:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
Interesting stuff


[01/26/2022 9:07 AM] Deathmumi#1369
be care dont do wrong moves cause damage your cards easily we are here directly playing with voltages


[01/26/2022 9:07 AM] Deathmumi#1369
so stick to lower voltages


[01/26/2022 9:07 AM] Deathmumi#1369
try your dot can handle 1500mhz 800mv


[01/26/2022 9:08 AM] Deathmumi#1369
if it cant holds then 825 850 875 900 go slightly to find yours


[01/26/2022 9:08 AM] Deathmumi#1369
you can apply pl lastly


[01/26/2022 9:09 AM] Deathmumi#1369
firstly give full power for voltage need


[01/26/2022 9:09 AM] Deathmumi#1369
you will see when voltage drops what you applied


[01/26/2022 9:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
So I found semi sweet spot


[01/26/2022 9:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
Without this curve stuff


[01/26/2022 9:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
But I imagine doing this more advanced tweaking will get me


[01/26/2022 9:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
To max mh/S


[01/26/2022 9:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
So I will learn that

it will adjust all selected dots by 1500mhz in line


[01/26/2022 3:37 PM] Deathmumi#1369
look example in my curve


[01/26/2022 3:37 PM] Deathmumi#1369
you need to apply similar


[01/26/2022 3:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
start from which dot?


[01/26/2022 3:38 PM] Deathmumi#1369
i dont know start from 800 to end


[01/26/2022 3:38 PM] Deathmumi#1369
if its not enough to hold 1500mhz


[01/26/2022 3:38 PM] Deathmumi#1369
then try 825 850 875 900 ..... etc go try each


[01/26/2022 3:38 PM] Deathmumi#1369
it's based on your card silicone


[01/26/2022 3:39 PM] Deathmumi#1369
i have 20x 3060 think i' m trying each ones spot tweak point by try


[01/26/2022 3:39 PM] Deathmumi#1369

but i dont get wtf im doing with this curve


[01/26/2022 3:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
i dont understand what its doing


[01/26/2022 3:40 PM] Deathmumi#1369
it's adjusting voltage need of depending mhz


[01/26/2022 3:40 PM] Deathmumi#1369
look in stock this one is based on default bios


[01/26/2022 3:41 PM] Deathmumi#1369
what we are doing here is limiting mhz and voltage


[01/26/2022 3:41 PM] Deathmumi#1369
so every algorithm have spot points to get max hashing while with enough power usage


[01/26/2022 3:42 PM] Deathmumi#1369
so if you mining ergo that means you need lot of vmem clock speed


[01/26/2022 3:42 PM] Deathmumi#1369
due voltage usage on both core and mem it's limits card hashing


[01/26/2022 3:42 PM] Deathmumi#1369
so in here limiting core will produces memory energy needs

[01/26/2022 3:43 PM] Deathmumi#1369
also it's require enough power for wanted core clock with lower pl


[01/26/2022 3:44 PM] Deathmumi#1369
ok it's showing card working around 1650mhz and 905mv pulling

[01/26/2022 3:46 PM] Deathmumi#1369
i explained what you need already 😄


[01/26/2022 3:47 PM] Deathmumi#1369
you need to select all dots which you need to edit


[01/26/2022 3:47 PM] Deathmumi#1369
then input what mhz you want them


[01/26/2022 3:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
so which dots do i wana edit


[01/26/2022 3:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
everything up to that line?


[01/26/2022 3:47 PM] Deathmumi#1369
it will apply all selected dots to mhz


[01/26/2022 3:48 PM] Deleted User#0000

Improved voltage/frequency curve editor in MSI Afterburner 4.6.1
This video demonstrates many advanced voltage/frequency curve editing tricks, most of them exist in the latest public 4.6.0 release, but some of them (e.g. fragment selection and operation) are new for 4.6.1. Pay attention to keyboard input indicator in bottom left corner to see all keyboard shortcuts I’m using. The following tricks are being sh...

[01/26/2022 5:43 PM] Deathmumi#1369
Go for hiveos then its easier settings


[01/26/2022 5:43 PM] Deathmumi#1369
Its not easy to setup all 3060v1 for 125mhs


[01/26/2022 5:44 PM] Deathmumi#1369
Also its only possible if you use monitor signal out or working dummy with 470.05 driver


[01/26/2022 5:45 PM] Deathmumi#1369
Otherwise you need to use like trex miner so can have like lhr 97 makes around 115-120mhs

also have dummy or monitor connecting ?


[01/26/2022 7:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
monitor because of a rdp bug


[01/26/2022 7:05 PM] Deathmumi#1369
unless you have done my telling it's meaningless of having v1


[01/26/2022 7:06 PM] Deathmumi#1369
well while connecting monitor but using screen that makes voltage breaking


[01/26/2022 7:06 PM] Deathmumi#1369
so you can2 t mine full hash


[01/26/2022 7:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
well the screen is plugged in


[01/26/2022 7:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
but i connect via rdp


[01/26/2022 7:06 PM] Deathmumi#1369
you need connect and dont do anything to see max hash


[01/26/2022 7:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
plugged in but turned off


[01/26/2022 7:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
what u mean


[01/26/2022 7:07 PM] Deathmumi#1369
these must be for every card same


[01/26/2022 7:07 PM] Deathmumi#1369
otherwise you need to use dummy


[01/26/2022 7:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
if i disconnect the monitor from the host i get a RDP issue


[01/26/2022 7:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
and cannot see the screen


[01/26/2022 7:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
therefore i have to have a monitor plugged in


[01/26/2022 7:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
cuz i maintain this remotely


[01/26/2022 7:07 PM] Deathmumi#1369
remote also cuts down speed


[01/26/2022 7:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
so how do i check speed


[01/26/2022 7:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
accurately without being logged in


[01/26/2022 7:08 PM] Deathmumi#1369
cause it triggers usage of card signal using


[01/26/2022 7:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
from mining pool?


[01/26/2022 7:08 PM] Deathmumi#1369
maybe from pool reported hash


[01/26/2022 7:09 PM] Deathmumi#1369
or you need to disconnect some to hold hashes stabilize


[01/26/2022 7:09 PM] Deathmumi#1369
then check quickly


[01/26/2022 7:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
wym


[01/26/2022 7:09 PM] Deathmumi#1369
it shows max before it downs again

try to optimize other cards firstly not your first card which you are using shared screen


[01/26/2022 7:12 PM] Deathmumi#1369
also don' t forget still they need to have signal output


[01/26/2022 7:12 PM] Deathmumi#1369
if you have no signal dummy or monitor from them forget about 115+ mhs

can you understand what i mean now ? about signal output


[01/26/2022 7:21 PM] Deathmumi#1369
unless you not give output for card you cant go pass beyond your current speeds


[01/26/2022 7:22 PM] Deathmumi#1369
in other hand you need to try with trex nbminer or other softwares lhr commands

[01/27/2022 5:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
tbh why r the temps so much higher


[01/27/2022 5:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
and efficiencies so low


[01/27/2022 5:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
shud i lower the power limit


[01/27/2022 6:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
i got it


[01/27/2022 6:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
c:


[01/27/2022 6:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
extremely efficient


[01/27/2022 6:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
temps down


[01/27/2022 6:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
and high hash rates baby

[01/28/2022 8:33 AM] Terremot#4855
yeah, it is good


[01/28/2022 8:33 AM] Terremot#4855
I had to reduce the memory clock on my zotac 3080Ti


[01/28/2022 8:33 AM] Terremot#4855
because zotacs suck

[01/28/2022 8:44 AM] Terremot#4855
it took me a whole day to work out that it was the memory clock on the zotac that was messing up badly


[01/30/2022 9:19 AM] Deathmumi#1369
Your zotac seems doing well anyway cause it consump - 20w less


[01/30/2022 9:20 AM] Deathmumi#1369
Efficiency better then your top card


[03/11/2022 11:42 PM] Terremot#4855
I don't need to worry about efficiency


[03/11/2022 11:43 PM] Terremot#4855
so I'm going for maximum hashrate


[03/22/2022 2:56 PM] basicaf#2958
Has anyone ever figured out how to make the gigabyte 3060ti hashrate not suck. I got a hell of a dud.


[03/22/2022 4:22 PM] blackinsecure#3693
I'm having the same issue with Palit 3060


[03/22/2022 4:57 PM] basicaf#2958
@blackinsecure I use to be able to get 134 on it but I forgot the settings.


[03/22/2022 4:58 PM] blackinsecure#3693
I took it out of the box 2h ago and it's below 60


[03/22/2022 4:58 PM] basicaf#2958
Are you on hive or windows?


[03/22/2022 4:58 PM] blackinsecure#3693
linux


[03/22/2022 4:59 PM] basicaf#2958
If you're on hive try -502 core 2600 memory take off the power limit and see what you get


[03/24/2022 8:51 AM] Terremot#4855
If it's zotac, try 1580 core 2100 memory


[03/24/2022 8:52 AM] Terremot#4855
I get 137.3


[03/24/2022 8:52 AM] Terremot#4855
but if you need to limit power for efficiency, do that after


[03/24/2022 8:52 AM] Terremot#4855
mine stays at 128W


[03/28/2022 12:51 PM] SoCool#6419
Anybody have an MSI trio LHR?


[03/30/2022 6:04 AM] Salu#0001

3080?


[03/30/2022 8:15 PM] SoCool#6419
3070, I should have been specific sorry


[03/30/2022 8:15 PM] SoCool#6419
though I have a Zotac 3080 ti arriving tomorrow... if anybody has the overclock settings for that..


[03/30/2022 8:16 PM] SoCool#6419
I know people link that google spreadsheet, but honestly it's been linked for ages and seems like dated info when I look at it but maybe it's well maintained


[03/30/2022 8:20 PM] SoCool#6419
This looks like what I'm after... Zotac mem +2600 core +100 power level 250


[03/30/2022 8:21 PM] SoCool#6419
and fan 60. All things being equal - just for straight mining, this 3070 LHR's efficiency is really impressive after I tweaked it


[03/30/2022 8:21 PM] Terremot#4855
Depends the coolness of the location of your rig


[03/30/2022 8:22 PM] SoCool#6419
I may play with the power level a bit on that.. regarding temperature my computer case is good for cooling but it's not a mining rig.. I live in a cold climate though so maybe that helps 🤷 guess I'll play with it.

Did you do anything with the lhr setting for it or is 3080 TI not LHR?


[03/30/2022 8:23 PM] Terremot#4855
I was using lolminer


[03/30/2022 8:23 PM] SoCool#6419
On my 3070 I found the sweet spot at 86 lhr, power limit 140 (it only runs at 107) and core 1500 mem 8100 - runs at 41 degrees constant with 60 fan


[03/30/2022 8:24 PM] Terremot#4855
lolminer automatically tunes lhr cards


[03/30/2022 8:24 PM] Terremot#4855
with the lhr-autotune


[03/30/2022 8:24 PM] Terremot#4855
or whatever it is


[03/30/2022 8:24 PM] SoCool#6419
nbminer does too but it takes a while bouncing up / down steps


[03/30/2022 8:25 PM] Terremot#4855
lolminer is quick


[03/30/2022 8:25 PM] SoCool#6419
Perhaps I'll try lolminer though, got a link?


[03/30/2022 8:25 PM] Terremot#4855
windows?


[03/30/2022 8:25 PM] SoCool#6419
I bounce back and forth depending what I'm doing. I'll try windows for the moment unless it's better on linux

I use hiveos


[03/30/2022 8:26 PM] Terremot#4855
1.47 is very good


[03/30/2022 8:26 PM] SoCool#6419
Cool, yeah I saw you use hiveos, looks like they don't have a windows release? Well I wanted to boot back over to linux anyway to fiddle with something unrelated as is


[03/30/2022 8:26 PM] Terremot#4855
yup, they have on the link I gave


[03/30/2022 8:28 PM] SoCool#6419
bla heh chrome doesn't like it just like it didn't like t-rex.. I'll pop over to linux maybe it'll not give me crap then


[03/30/2022 8:47 PM] SoCool#6419
Idunno... lolminer seems more up to date than nbminer referencing work done on latest drivers, but it's hard to walk away from 107w with 142mhs and think lolminer will do better for me. I'll let it tune for a while and see what happens; it doesn't control clocks it seems


[03/30/2022 9:18 PM] v3x3v.eth#6049
I'm running 1575 and 3140 on hive for my 3080ti. And that's 266 mh at 220w or so


[03/30/2022 9:18 PM] v3x3v.eth#6049
On trex


[03/30/2022 9:37 PM] SoCool#6419
Nice! Thanks for the detail!


[03/30/2022 9:39 PM] SoCool#6419
..yeah, back to nbminer. LoLMiner did not find a good place in LHR for my 3070; it was hanging out at 140w and 80-100 mhs, nbminer gives me 142mhs at 107w non-stop and the temperature was a lot higher with lolminer


[03/30/2022 9:39 PM] SoCool#6419
Maybe I'll try t-rex next and see if I can make it happy


[03/30/2022 9:57 PM] v3x3v.eth#6049
I love trex personally. I've only had bad luck with lolminer but that's just personal experience. I also had not repadded my 3080ti when I tried lolminer so that probably didn't help


[03/31/2022 12:06 AM] SoCool#6419
So far I've found nbminer to be really easy to work with and I'm getting great results with my 3070 lhr out of it. Though perhaps trex will do better, dunno.. I also wonder about the miner app fees, never gave it much thought but I wonder which ones are highest?


[04/02/2022 3:21 PM] $aX#5658
@Terremot Are you seeing gains on ERG with latest lolminer on LHR cards?


[04/02/2022 3:21 PM] Terremot#4855
Can't say I have


[04/02/2022 3:22 PM] Terremot#4855
I'll give it another go


[04/02/2022 3:23 PM] Terremot#4855
Going to leave it 30 minutes to settle


[04/02/2022 4:06 PM] Terremot#4855

at least 10°C lower than eth


[04/02/2022 9:35 PM] v3x3v.eth#6049
Are these 3080ti? And if so what settings you running


[04/02/2022 9:36 PM] Terremot#4855
yup


[04/02/2022 9:36 PM] Terremot#4855
core clock at 1800


[04/02/2022 9:37 PM] v3x3v.eth#6049
Mem? I'm way off that haha. I'm at 1575 core right now


[04/02/2022 9:37 PM] Terremot#4855
the rest depends on the card and can be anything from 2550 to 3000 with P0 state forced


[04/02/2022 9:37 PM] v3x3v.eth#6049
Hmm alright


[04/02/2022 9:37 PM] Terremot#4855

I've got a founders and an aorus


[04/02/2022 9:38 PM] Terremot#4855
aorus master I have at mem clock 3000


[04/02/2022 9:38 PM] Terremot#4855
and FE can be around 2600


[04/02/2022 9:38 PM] v3x3v.eth#6049
I'll give it a shot. Thanks for the info man


[04/02/2022 9:38 PM] Terremot#4855
P0 state is like increasing mem clock by another 400


[04/02/2022 9:39 PM] Terremot#4855
I'm going for pure hashrate ofc


[04/02/2022 9:39 PM] v3x3v.eth#6049
Got any great settings for LHR  3080?


[04/02/2022 9:39 PM] v3x3v.eth#6049

[04/02/2022 9:39 PM] Terremot#4855
no, just 3060TiLHR


[04/02/2022 9:39 PM] Terremot#4855
i focused on 3080Ti because of ergo


[04/02/2022 9:39 PM] v3x3v.eth#6049

so not terrible


[04/02/2022 9:40 PM] v3x3v.eth#6049

Same. Might just be my aorus hitting it's limit


[04/02/2022 10:09 PM] Terremot#4855
it takes a few minutes


[04/02/2022 10:09 PM] Terremot#4855
but then you might need to reduce the memory clock


[04/02/2022 10:10 PM] SoCool#6419
My 3080Ti is hitting constant 276 with 229w, but the mem temp is 80 at 70 fan - I'm curious about your mem temps there..

if you can afford it, you might want to consider these pads: https://kriticalpads.com/


[04/02/2022 10:11 PM] Terremot#4855
they do custom


[04/02/2022 10:11 PM] Terremot#4855
for specific GPUs


[04/02/2022 10:12 PM] Terremot#4855
and at 20W/MK, they're some of the best conductivity I've seen


[04/02/2022 10:12 PM] Terremot#4855
but they are pricey


[04/02/2022 10:13 PM] Terremot#4855

Use t-rex with lhr mode core clock 1800, force p0 state and play with mem clock


[04/05/2022 3:29 AM] v3x3v.eth#6049
Man that had my rig going wild the other day lmao


[04/05/2022 3:30 AM] v3x3v.eth#6049
I tried that when you mentioned it. Server psus were pumping. One GPU hit like 278 the other one wouldn't come out of the dirt at like 122. I just went back to the tried and true


[04/05/2022 3:31 AM] Terremot#4855
I have the mem clock on 2550 to 3499 depending on the card


[04/05/2022 3:31 AM] Terremot#4855
And then wait for it to settle


[04/05/2022 3:31 AM] v3x3v.eth#6049

The cards will go wild until it achieves a stable hashrate


[04/05/2022 10:55 AM] SoCool#6419
Oof, I'm happy with my 229w 277mhs on my 3080 ti, hoping the lower power usage will help the card stay healthy longer 🤞


[04/05/2022 10:56 AM] Terremot#4855

[04/05/2022 10:59 AM] SoCool#6419

[04/05/2022 10:59 AM] SoCool#6419
I don't trust myself to disassemble and replace anything but you can just stick a sink to the back and it helps I assume

well, they have the option that you can send in cards for them to re-pad

Hello @here! 
I am currently using the same OC settings on my GPU's as I was for ETH mining.
Is it possible to fine tune for autolykos2 in order to increase hashrate, or should I just keep the OC settings I already was using for ethhash? To be clear, they seem to be performing very well, but I am new to mining ERG and am not sure if I should be epxecting more from my GPU's when mining autolykos2  or not...


[04/14/2022 7:25 PM] Wii#9265
Yes, go ahead and fine tune. A tip is to prioritize memory, Autolykos2 is mem heavy

[04/14/2022 7:25 PM] Wii#9265
But core should be higher than what you have on ethash


[04/14/2022 9:13 PM] RelevantData#9545
Thank you. Do you know of any OC references for different cards I could use as a reference/starting point?


[04/14/2022 9:33 PM] Wii#9265
There is a chart somewhere, let me find it

You can almost always get a bit higher hashrate than in the chart, although your wattage will increase too

From what I can tell by my own research, if you are mining ERG at all right now you are ahead of the game and using what GPU you have wisely.  😎 👍


[04/14/2022 10:02 PM] Wii#9265
Of course. I got it clocked to 260 MH/s at 230 W I think… so that’s fairly efficient at 1.13 MH/s/W

looking for some help here, i tried using the force p0 on hiveos on my 3060ti.  it crashed the rig and now that i got it back online all of my hashrates dumped hard on all of my nvidias.  how do i turn it off.  i clicked it off on the overclock settings but nothing has changed it seems like its stuck on


[04/15/2022 3:17 AM] LuxGoods#8116
I have a question of my own. 

I have a 3070TI, that has inconsistent hashrate. It was steady a few days ago, but now jumps around. 

I have the core underclocked, and the memory overclocked, 150 power limit. Thanks!

Figured it out, followed donkey miners settings, and it's looking good. 
This was probably LHR then.

How can I check how efficient my 1660 super is running the NBMiner program?


[04/19/2022 11:14 PM] LuxGoods#8116
efficiency is hash-rate per watt. 

for example, 180 MH/s / 165 watts is ~1.10 MH per watt.

A noob question...how do I see what the min/max core and mem clock speed is for my nvidia card? I have a decent hash rate (w/current oc settings) based off what others have suggested online but would like to experiment myself without bricking my card or burning my place down. I'm using hiveos.

[06/03/2022 6:35 AM] Willgscifi#9773
My v1 hynix memory was only getting 135mh for 20W more, sold it as it's always been inefficient and my electricity rate is sky high.

new drivers wont work with t-rex however  nb miner works fine I noticed this on nicehash I found this - NVIDIA released a new driver version on May 24th. NVIDIA 512.95 driver do not work with the 100% LHR unlock.

We tested the unlock with the latest drivers on all verified miners, also included in NiceHash Miner. NiceHash QuickMiner (Excavator), NBMiner NanoMiner, and LolMiner.

If you are already on the NVIDIA driver version 512.95, then for now, we suggest downgrading to NVIDIA driver version 512.77 where the unlock still works.

invalid shares means you probably just need to dial down the memory clock a little bit

3070, 3080, 3080 TI. Recently adjusted my overclocking strategy from setting a power limit and 0 core to no power limit, and locking the core. Here are my results:

Seeing some fluctuations in wattage, 3080's in particular floating betwen 177-230W


[08/29/2022 5:19 PM] Breakfasto#1552
Wondering if allowing the wattage to fluctuate is better for share stability over locking the power limit

will try this out on my hynix cards


[09/09/2022 3:22 PM] Ciufcia#1746
Hello, I made this doc with OC, AMD cards are a little bit weird but overall this should work nicely. Every model of card was tested on full rig of 12 GPUS or like in case of 3090 and 3080TI on full rig of 8 GPUS. This should be stable in most cases, but the power really depends from manufacturer. 3060TI (H) means 3060TI with Hynix memory. NVIDIA miner was trex and AMD was teamredminer
5600XT has modified bios from bitby.ru and power draw should be lower than the one in my doc


[09/09/2022 3:23 PM] Ciufcia#1746
power is measured from hiveos, in reality it will be more power draw depending of your PSU

Most 3000's series cards do good around 1635cclock and 2600mems but for some reason locking the cv doesn't work like windows. so you will need to PL the 3070ti with those settings you can start around 150w to -170w

dude i enterd the same setting for oc like above the pic core 300 mem 1300 but the system gave me every time a error message


[09/13/2022 10:39 PM] BotLifeGaming#8597
You on hive or windows?


[09/13/2022 10:40 PM] Cryptolga#1748
hiveon


[09/13/2022 10:42 PM] BotLifeGaming#8597
3080 or the 3090?


[09/13/2022 10:43 PM] Cryptolga#1748
3080


[09/13/2022 10:46 PM] BotLifeGaming#8597
Ok try locking core at 1635 or 1665 and 2600 mems. and a PL of 170 to 180 which ever gives you best efficiency


[09/13/2022 10:47 PM] BotLifeGaming#8597
and you should get 220 - 225 mhs in that area


[09/13/2022 10:48 PM] Cryptolga#1748
the problem is i enter like this core 300 mem 1300 pl 0 is that right ?


[09/13/2022 10:51 PM] BotLifeGaming#8597
PL 170 and change the core from 300 to 1635 or 1665


[09/13/2022 10:57 PM] BotLifeGaming#8597
@Cryptolga how you making out?


[09/13/2022 11:00 PM] Cryptolga#1748
about 205-210 mhs per card


[09/13/2022 11:06 PM] BotLifeGaming#8597
then try 180 PL


[09/13/2022 11:07 PM] BotLifeGaming#8597
or up the core to 1665


[09/13/2022 11:07 PM] BotLifeGaming#8597
try core first then PL


[09/13/2022 11:19 PM] Cryptolga#1748
nope not working just 206 mhs


[09/13/2022 11:32 PM] BotLifeGaming#8597
what gpu is it evg, gigabyte or asus


[09/14/2022 4:35 AM] Cryptolga#1748
kfa2 its the company from galax


[09/14/2022 9:27 AM] Attila#3944
You can’t go terribly wrong with gigabyte ocs in general. I have gaming oc pro 70tis, I’ll let you know in a sec what I have


[09/14/2022 9:34 AM] Attila#3944
With Gigabyte 70tis the mem clock is tricky. They can withstand significantly lower than you would expect.

[09/14/2022 9:59 AM] WHALE#9260
Yesterday i ran another oc which was stabler than my earlier ocs but eventually after 5 hours it gave rejects again


[09/14/2022 9:59 AM] WHALE#9260

[09/14/2022 9:59 AM] WHALE#9260

[09/14/2022 10:00 AM] WHALE#9260
?


[09/14/2022 10:01 AM] Attila#3944
175ish. When I go over 2100 they crash. I can do 180 at around 2000 but at 15% more power. Not worth it


[09/14/2022 10:02 AM] WHALE#9260
Oh okayy👌🏻


[09/14/2022 10:02 AM] Attila#3944

[09/14/2022 10:03 AM] Attila#3944
I figured they would be ok on ETH and when it goes away will do whatever on ERG. I already had the FE but it was hard to get back then


[09/14/2022 10:03 AM] WHALE#9260

thanks ill try playing around and lowering it a bit


[09/14/2022 9:12 PM] BotLifeGaming#8597
@TheF1zZ try 300 or 1665  cclock your mems look good and a Locked-cv of 730


[09/14/2022 9:15 PM] BotLifeGaming#8597
Just so people know setting the --lock-cv 730 makes a difference on power if you don't do the --lock-cv 730 your power will be higher. for windows in HiveOS you can set it when you add miner and select miner config extra params put "lock-cv": "730" if you have 3000 series cards or you can "730,730,730,730" like that for mutliple cards 730 i recommend for 3000 series cards as i never tested on any other cards


[09/14/2022 9:43 PM] Cryptolga#1748
still no idea about my problem ?


[09/14/2022 9:47 PM] BotLifeGaming#8597
I messaged you


[09/15/2022 12:57 AM] scorp10n#3543
Does anyone know why decreasing the core clock to negative numbers increases the power draw and hashrate? I don't understand the logic as to why this is happening, but it happens in Windows and Linux and if I go -1000 in Linux the power draw goes through the roof and the hashrate climbs too. All this with a locked core clock to boot!


[09/15/2022 12:58 AM] scorp10n#3543
When mining ETH, you can only decrease the core so much before you lose hashrate, but with ERG, it's the opposite! If I set the core clock to zero, the power draw tanks as does the hashrate.


[09/15/2022 1:00 AM] scorp10n#3543
My current theory is that reducing the CC allows the memory to draw more power thus increasing the hashrate, but I'm not increasing the MC, just playing with the CC (my mem clocks are set to what I used for ETH).


[09/15/2022 1:00 AM] scorp10n#3543
But I'm not convinced of that yet....


[09/15/2022 1:34 AM] scorp10n#3543
I should add these are RTX 30 cards (Non-LHR).

any help here ??


[09/15/2022 8:34 PM] BotLifeGaming#8597
@WS windows or Hive?


[09/15/2022 8:38 PM] WS#8799
hive


[09/15/2022 8:43 PM] BotLifeGaming#8597
for the 3090 try 1635 cclock 1500 mems and pl 252


[09/15/2022 8:43 PM] BotLifeGaming#8597
and you should get 270mhs with 250w


[09/15/2022 8:43 PM] BotLifeGaming#8597
maybe 273mhs after it runs for a bit Trex I think works better then nbminer


[09/15/2022 8:44 PM] WS#8799
ok will try

[09/15/2022 9:19 PM] Boldimore#5357
But using 1080 Lcore, 2500 memory yields only 120mhs


[09/15/2022 9:19 PM] Boldimore#5357
Though, at 98w


[09/15/2022 9:24 PM] Boldimore#5357
The comment bellow this one is for 3080 clocks? Not sure what you mean with lock cv, isn't lock core frequency doing nearly the same thing ?


[09/15/2022 10:14 PM] carllittle1#3740
increase core clock to 1440 and mem to 2700 and see what happens


[09/15/2022 11:25 PM] BotLifeGaming#8597
Locking the core voltage is the mv and two different locks but work together. Hive doesn't support locking the core voltage only windows. so you would need a PL set instead.


[09/15/2022 11:35 PM] Boldimore#5357
It shows promise

I lost 40+MHs :/


[09/18/2022 7:29 PM] carllittle1#3740
boost the mem back up to 2600 and you should gain most of that back while still reducing power consumption. if it crashes then lower mems by 50 and it should run stable from there. but still thats 30 watts per card in power savings

If you have cheap electricity, you can stick with your previous settings, alternatively, I'd recommend staying as efficient as possible since mining isn't profitable rn and 
It seems you're saving 60w for 41mh so it really depends on your electricity cost rn

I have 3 5700xts which were BIOS modded for Eth. 

Would it make sense for me to revert those cards back to their original BIOS for ergo? Thanks!


[10/04/2022 5:03 AM] Lopes#3669
Use the same settings for ergo too , just increase core too 1200

No other settings and this was running on NBMiner. Also same as yourself Veg 64 flashed to 56. The second lot of settings running at 119.0 was using TeamRedMiner. Good Luck.

Use afterburner and go into the curve editor. Click on a point starting at 800mv and press control+L to lock the core voltage, keep going down until the voltage is low enough to trigger power state 3, you will know when the memory speed drops considerably. Leave everything else alone. This is for best efficiency


[01/12/2023 8:37 AM] superfuru#4231

[02/22/2023 4:52 AM] Sonicchemist#6523
In afterburner for a 1660 super, is it better to crank the memory as hot as it can handle? Or is it more beneficial to keep the memory clock at 600+ as recommended by the ergo website?


[02/23/2023 1:54 AM] deathgripson#2395
I think that depends on how much you need that GPU to last lol


[02/23/2023 3:42 AM] Sonicchemist#6523
Long enough to buy better cards!


[02/23/2023 3:42 AM] Sonicchemist#6523
Lol so it would be more beneficial in a short run


[02/23/2023 5:00 AM] deathgripson#2395
Im pretty sure if the mem reaches 100c type stuff for sustained amount of time it can damage especially on earlier hardware


[02/23/2023 5:01 AM] deathgripson#2395
so really it depends to what level u are cranking it all cards have the sillicon lottery throwing off estimates from one to another


[02/23/2023 11:19 AM] Sonicchemist#6523
I've been underclocking for a while & could be nice to switch things up


[02/23/2023 5:25 PM] deathgripson#2395
just keep it monitored and find out its limits, hitting max memory is annoying because of occasional memory related crashes but if youre willing to deal w that testing then go for it
