## Ergo Tizen

Create an Ergo node that runs natively on smart devices such as TVs, fridges, mobile phones, watches, etc. This will be achieved by targeting Tizen OS, Samsungs open source mobile operating system and done in a way where it should be easily portable to other platforms such as WebOS (LG smart TVs).

Currently there isn't a lot of light client based messages on the P2P layer of Ergo so this project aims to test viability of running nodes on smart devices without much functionality. At least connecting to a few peers and performing handshakes/probing for peers, etc.

At the end of ErgoHack VI the goal is to have a node running natively on a real Samsung TV and displaying basic network information.

Couple of extra diagrams

First couple of days will focus on the .NET bridge/proxy library (.NET for now because Tizen uses .NET) to provide platform functionality not available to web and starting the web compatible node library

Got the bridge/proxy to a stage where it can proxy multiple outbound TCP connections over websockets for my node running in a web environment. Repo: https://github.com/ross-weir/Ergode.Bridge

Working on the nodes "web socket bridge" transport next, goal is to make the interface the same as any other Web stream so it can be handled the same as a native Deno TCP connection so there's no difference between running it in a web env vs natively on a desktop

Working on node client library, able to create TCP connections/send/receive data via the websocket bridge in the browser.

Implemented Web Streams API on top of websocket bridge so the interface is the same as a TCP stream so the bridge is transparent

lil update:

- Published new NPM package that provides a reader/writer for over the wire encoding for ergo: https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-lib-wasm/pull/32
- Encoding/decoding of peer handshakes largely working and passing test case from Ergo reference client, just missing sessionid and restapi peer features: https://github.com/ross-weir/ergode

- Working on config schema & validation
- Setup logging

Once config is done can probably start wiring all the pieces together and be close to having a node with p2p handshake working in web browser

Ergode node is now working both in web/browser with a bridge/proxy and natively as a standalone executable over TCP and establishing handshakes with Ergo reference client peers. 

Tidying time and maybe start a dashboard UI for the TV app soon.

Update:

- Setup pipeline to deploy to emulator and 2x Tizen specific projects for service app & ui
- Fixed a few issues specific to running on emulator
- Everything is running on emulator now
- Updated `ergode` README with some very rough details on how/why of the nodes design choices

Ergohack code making up the project:

- https://github.com/ross-weir/Ergode.Tizen contains Tizen UI (runs node) & Service app (bridge)
- https://github.com/ross-weir/Ergode.Bridge Bridge used to proxy TCP connections over websockets
- https://github.com/ross-weir/ergode Main project `ergode`

Nothing super interesting from me for the last few days, just working on polishing the ergode library and setting groundwork for future components

Added a CLI that aims to be easy to run, I'm hoping to just have executable that users download and run which contains sensible defaults. But can be configured with a config file of course

Continue polishing and update the README

[03/03/2023 6:13 PM] MGpai#4313
Is this a complete native implementation??


[03/03/2023 6:14 PM] MGpai#4313
Or is this a wrapper of the JVM node?


[03/03/2023 7:12 PM] soysor#6001
Not a wrapper, new implementation


[03/03/2023 7:21 PM] MGpai#4313
WOW that is amazing!


[03/03/2023 7:21 PM] MGpai#4313
an entire client written from scratch is so cool


[03/03/2023 7:26 PM] MGpai#4313
Does this support testnet?


[03/03/2023 7:26 PM] MGpai#4313
I want to run a client to try to mine


[03/03/2023 7:28 PM] soysor#6001
‚ù§Ô∏è 

Yeah it supports testnet but it doesn't do much at the moment, just establishes handshakes with peers and that's it - lots of work left before its functional
