Can't redeem my Paideia,  Error: 400 - Unable to redeem with NFT.


[05/11/2022 9:45 AM] samnovember#0000

[05/11/2022 1:26 PM] Flaxen#0000
[thread]: You guys might want to check, I'm getting cancelled transactions trying to redeem any of the vesting contracts. I'm using the mobile wallet, so no consolidation issues there. Never had issues before either. Plus the dashboard is no longer showing values of the vesting contracts.

@Luivatra any problems there? Can you check pls

do i need test tokens or can i stake my actual paideia?


[05/27/2022 9:26 AM] AlexisE#0000
thats just a test staking, official staking will be live on the 31st May


[05/27/2022 6:24 PM] quirk220#0000

[05/28/2022 2:47 PM] Betquity#0000

[05/28/2022 3:16 PM] esot321c#0000
That will be on the ergopad website in a few days


[05/28/2022 3:17 PM] esot321c#0000

Hi all! So..can staking start today? 🙂


[05/31/2022 6:05 PM] esot321c#0000
We are going to delay one or two days

[05/31/2022 6:05 PM] esot321c#0000

[05/31/2022 6:05 PM] esot321c#0000

There are some minor changes that were pushed today, but we are still working on a final solution.


[06/06/2022 10:16 AM] Leif Erickson#0000
The paideia staking issues are fixed.  Some transactions were refunded too quickly, and the fix is in place so try again and if there are further issues, let us know?! Thanks all!


[06/13/2022 11:49 AM] happy-buddha#0000
What's the rough timeframe for a regular Joe like me to be able to create a DAO on Paideia? If I wanted to launch a DAO in August or early Fall, is Paideia a realistic possibility?


[06/13/2022 1:16 PM] theta_decay#0000
Mvp by q3/q4. Not sure about August specifically, but 2022, not 2023.

I created a 2nd stake key rather than adding to my original stake, I don't see a 2nd staked amount within ergopad (under any address). funds have been gone since initiating 2nd stake on 9 July. How do I fix?


[07/11/2022 12:00 AM] theta_decay#0000
Please dm me your address, I'll look into it.


[07/11/2022 12:33 AM] Marty#0000
Right now node is resyncing. In a few hours the redundancy will be up and running. Some of the new services only connected to one of our nodes, and that'll be fixed shortly.

Hey yall,

Below is the circuit diagram as it stands. Not optimized yet. It's essentially teslaundmehr's 10MHz HFSSTC with a bigger gate cap a la steve ward's HFSSTC, allowing for high peak voltages in the 2.5 uH inductor (bigger coil). The borosilicate glass globe was created for me by the talented Wayne Strattman with 15 torrs of xenon gas and...

he says if he implements a railgun he can fire plasma toroids at 30km/s


[11/30/2022 10:25 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
that's kinda terrifying, no? this is like a real sci-fi gun


[11/30/2022 10:28 PM] fruittree#0000
sure but at least it is just bullet and still has to interact with air etc. I think at these speeds bullets hit air like a brick wall.  I think..


[11/30/2022 10:30 PM] fruittree#0000
crazy times..


[11/30/2022 10:30 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
but perhaps the toroid doesn't experience the same physical limitations


[11/30/2022 10:32 PM] fruittree#0000
oh yeah that aspect, i was thinking of barrels that use plasma to accelerate the bullet


[11/30/2022 10:36 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
That looks like it would be a bit painful if it hit you


[11/30/2022 10:36 PM] marty_ergopad#0000

Here's what I did:...(I use cold wallet mobile)

1. On my desktop try to scan the QR code with my HOT phone. The message "scanned QR code was not....." is shown on the hot phone.
2. I then used my HOT phone navigating to paideia.im/demo, enter my address and instead of scanning the QR code i click "click link" below the QR code. The HOT wallet opens up showing "Authentication request" and a QR code. When I scan the QR code with my COLD wallet I get the same message "The scanner QR code....".

Both hot and cold wallets are using latest app from github. 2.2.2222

 Correct...I chose the wallet to sign from which shows a QR code.
When I try to scan that using my offline phone it shows the "Scanned QR code not known format".

That happens if I scan by clicking the qr button on the summary screen AND send button.

 No, it's scanning the QR code that ergopay/wallet creates. I was just testing all option, of which send funds was one :)

Not sure what to think of it. Professional governance class sounds like tradfi.

Or, representative government, which is probably better at scaling than direct democracy and people dealing with matters and people they know.

[12/07/2022 8:08 PM] Tefcek21#0000
no just joking, nothing 100% set in stone yet, but from the beginning we wanted to go crosschain with Paideia in the future, so Cardano is a good start especially with the upcoming rosen bridge and for the mass adaption to Paideia and Ergo


[12/07/2022 8:09 PM] Tefcek21#0000
Actually it would help a lot regards marketing and outreach not only for Ergo but Paideia too. Ergo is well known within the Cardano ecosystem but by far not enough

 Beautiful! A small bug I noticed: on my laptop the right side of the chart is cut off such that I can't see the price.

Hey #Ergo frens 👋

Occurred to me that a lot of your dApps are already designed for eUTxO architectures!

If you're interested in porting your dApp to Cardano ☎️ me maybe?

Hmm, also when changing DAOS using pulldown option in the upper left, it keeps giving me an error: Please add $Token to Participate. The DAO I verified the wallet to works fine, but the other DAOS do not, even though I have tokens for them.


[12/13/2022 9:51 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Might want to create a separate page for DAO configuration, one fr user and one for administrators. For users, so they know the terms of the DAO, such as how many days voting is allowed on proposals. Be better is that was a cleaner display aimed specifically at them.

[12/13/2022 10:18 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
or if you want to make a public google sheet that works too


[12/13/2022 10:19 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Ok. I suspect not being able to update or delete proposals will be a problem. I can understand the appeal, some kind of editing will mean version control. But, at some point you need to be able to either archive or delete old proposals, probably largely automatically.


[12/13/2022 10:19 PM] cafebedouin#0000
This is my area, thinking about information as a life cycle.


[12/13/2022 10:20 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Beginning a proposal with a discussion is a start. You'll want to archive approved proposals. Failed ones might need to be archived on a selected basis.


[12/13/2022 10:20 PM] cafebedouin#0000
But, likely there will be junk you'll want to roll over and delete too.


[12/13/2022 10:21 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Also, if there is discussion, people will want to incorporate what they learned during the discussion and update their proposal, so you'll need a mechanism for that. You could just have them submit a new one in light of those changes. But, that's just shitty version control.


[12/13/2022 10:22 PM] cafebedouin#0000
I wonder if you couldn't outsource some of that functionality onto github, EIP style?


[12/13/2022 10:23 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Proposal is a github DAOP, or whatever, and just links, and all the version control is handled outside of Paideia?


[12/13/2022 10:23 PM] cafebedouin#0000
And the discussion happens in app?


[12/13/2022 10:23 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Just spitballing here.


[12/13/2022 10:26 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
I was thinking about this too


[12/13/2022 10:26 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Right now we don't have a way to clean up old ones


[12/13/2022 10:27 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Eventually it will get to be too much


[12/13/2022 11:25 PM] LuivatraEP#0000
Updating a proposal while voting is already open doesnt seem like a good idea


[12/14/2022 7:36 AM] Gazza_SP#0000
(re @LuivatraEP : *Updating a proposal while voting is already open doesnt seem like a good idea*) 
 
 Yeah could likely be abused?


[12/14/2022 8:45 AM] LuivatraEP#0000
Well the on chain part cant be changed no matter what, guess the description will also have an auto generated description that explains what the proposal will do when passed. But there might be an extra description off chain that gives extra background info and motivation behind the proposal. Maybe it is ok to update the last part


[12/14/2022 12:36 PM] cafebedouin#0000
The problem is that a proposal and discussion normally implies change. When that is static and unchangeable, then you'll have multiple versions, each document with a life cycle. How long to keep a proposal that didn't go anywhere, with no discussion? How long to keep version 1 of a proposal that went through five iterations and was voted on? Does it matter if it passes or not? At what point does it go into an archive or get deleted? So, it's a categorization problem,   and those answers will likely vary from DAO to DAO. May even vary by discussion or proposal. But, one thing is for sure, you're going to need a good labelling system for proposals and discussions, if they are immutable.

Might just treat it like Google does email, and let DAOs do their own labeling. They can create whatever labels than need, and then can filter on those labels.

 A discussion should lead to a finalised proposal. A proposal has a fixed action that happens when it passes and can be voted on right away.  So no use changing it half way


[12/14/2022 2:50 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Quite right, from a programming perspective. It's getting to that finalized proposal that's the hard part, particularly when a lot of people are involved. Also, when a lot of people are involved, there tends to be a lot of documents, some of which will be ephemera, some you'll want forever, some will be good for some period of time and you'll need a way to do garbage collection and search. My graduate degree, such as it is, is in "library science", and dealing with these kinds of issues is a lot if what the work entails. 

May be out of scope for a MVP, just thought it worth raising.

(re  : *<cafebedouin> Quite right, from a programming perspective. It's getting to that finalized proposal that's the hard part, particularly when a lot of people are involved. Also, when a lot of people are involved, there tends to be a lot of documents, some of which will be ephemera, some you'll want forever, some will be good for some period of time and you'll need a way to do garbage collection and search.

 cafe what about creating a discussion about this on the Paideia DAO? 👀 interesting ideas and thoughts, think there will many people share their feedback on this

 Your profile was deleted and says “Scam” in red letters.  It’s possible someone impersonated you, then that user reported your actual account. ?? You may be able to appeal to TG to re-instate (if it’s worth the bother)…

Can the admin share on the function of paideia


[12/15/2022 6:48 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Feel free to ask a specific question. Docs.paideia.im covers a lot, and paideia.im/education


[12/15/2022 6:48 PM] millenium_earl2000#0000
Paideia is a DAO management software suite? What do u mean by this ? Is ergopad under paideia too ?


[12/15/2022 6:49 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Ergopad will go onto Paideia to handle Dao voting, yes


[12/15/2022 6:49 PM] millenium_earl2000#0000
What do u mran


[12/15/2022 6:49 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Paideia is designed to count votes on chain, and give people a way to discuss proposals


[12/15/2022 6:49 PM] millenium_earl2000#0000
What do u mean


[12/15/2022 6:49 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
I mean when a Dao makes decision, the community must discuss and vote on those


[12/15/2022 6:49 PM] millenium_earl2000#0000
Dao voting token is ergopad or paideia


[12/15/2022 6:50 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Each Dao has their own token


[12/15/2022 6:50 PM] millenium_earl2000#0000
So what is the difference between egopad and paideia


[12/15/2022 6:50 PM] millenium_earl2000#0000
What is the apy for ergopad and paideia staking


[12/15/2022 6:50 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Ergopad is a launchpad


[12/15/2022 6:50 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Please check ergopad.io/staking and choose the project from the dropdown to see current apy


[12/15/2022 6:51 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Paideia staking will be moved off ergopad and onto app.paideia.im when the smart contracts launch


[12/15/2022 6:51 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
I think anetabtc and egio will also migrate


[12/15/2022 6:53 PM] millenium_earl2000#0000
Migrate where


[12/15/2022 6:53 PM] millenium_earl2000#0000
Egio is dysfunction?


[12/15/2022 6:56 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Paideia will have staking V3, on ergopad it's V2. Just gives teams more control and allows the DAOs to count votes of staked tokens


[12/15/2022 6:56 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Tokens locked in staking V2 Wont have votes counted


[12/15/2022 6:56 PM] millenium_earl2000#0000
What was the issue price of paideia token at TGE


[12/15/2022 6:57 PM] millenium_earl2000#0000
Is the team for ergopad , paideia and spectrum the same team or different team


[12/15/2022 7:01 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
spectrum is different


[12/15/2022 7:01 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
ergopad team is same as paideia team yes


[12/15/2022 7:02 PM] millenium_earl2000#0000
Is Egio the same team ? Why is Egio disabled on ergopad


[12/15/2022 7:03 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
no


[12/15/2022 7:10 PM] millenium_earl2000#0000
There are very few staker for paideia

[12/16/2022 3:22 PM] tyja9#0000
Sorry if all ready answered but will we have to unstake paideia on ergopad and move to the app for V3 staking?


[12/16/2022 3:24 PM] tyja9#0000
Sorry if already answered but will we have to manually unstake paideia on ergopad and move to the app for V3 staking?

(re  : *<tyja9> Sorry if all ready answered but will we have to unstake paideia on ergopad and move to the app for V3 staking?*)

[12/16/2022 4:46 PM] millenium_earl2000#0000
When is the new v3? When must we unstake


[12/16/2022 4:59 PM] marty_ergopad#0000

I think maybe a large proportion of those joining are indeed bots, and they probably have OCR software for solving the captcha because Shieldy provides basic captcha that I had a bot solving back in like 2006. You might want to put a stronger barrier to joining the telegram.

(re @slasherzx : *Wow I'm overwhelmed with new users, however it feels like most of them are multiple accounts or bots. Anyways because of it, there would be a spike in ergo address. Hopefully, some will stay for the tech and belief that it would grow.*) 
 
 I think it’s mostly bots and They’ve hijacked the telegram. I’m having flashbacks to the Ergogames incident, it’s assault on telegram 13 all over again.

@marty_ergopad can we api call comment or proposal in a telegram bot so we keep track ?

(re @koutelier : *@marty_ergopad can we api call comment or proposal in a telegram bot so we keep track ?*) 
 
 Interesting Idea


[12/20/2022 10:39 AM] koutelier#0000
We have discussion on comets dao, would be really helpful if I didn’t have to check every now and then if someone commented


[12/20/2022 10:40 AM] koutelier#0000
A telegram bot could post on a dedicate channel or directly on comets tg


[12/20/2022 10:45 AM] LuivatraEP#0000
Think notifications were on to do (maybe not mvp) having public api for it would be good though

(re @LuivatraEP : *Think notifications were on to do (maybe not mvp) having public api for it would be good though*) 
 
 Anyone could be a bot like that no need to be from your end


[12/20/2022 10:55 AM] koutelier#0000
The api though it needs


[12/20/2022 10:55 AM] LuivatraEP#0000
yeah exactly


[12/20/2022 10:56 AM] koutelier#0000

(re @marty_ergopad : *Like for notifications on updates?*) 
 
 yeah, if new proposal, or new discussion , or even stay updated on certain discussion


[12/20/2022 3:49 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Would the bot just check the API periodically?


[12/20/2022 3:50 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
See if there's something new and post it


[12/20/2022 3:50 PM] koutelier#0000
correct


[12/20/2022 3:50 PM] koutelier#0000
something like kaching but for paideia daos


[12/20/2022 3:50 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
We have websockets for some things, but I don't think it's built out yet for notifications


[12/20/2022 3:50 PM] koutelier#0000
you get an notification whenever something happens


[12/20/2022 3:50 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
But yes there's API endpoints for specific proposals


[12/20/2022 3:51 PM] koutelier#0000

 What if the bot just checks for new comments and new proposals every 10 minutes and displays them

With a link to the relevant proposal

[12/21/2022 7:54 PM] Damon#0000
(re @ibetuwill : *2m tokens 🤔*) 
 
 Yep .. FDV is now ~$650k.  So $6500 for 2M tokens.  Probably a bit more than this with slippage.


[12/21/2022 7:55 PM] ibetuwill#0000
I will buy it, but later. It could go lower


[12/21/2022 7:57 PM] Damon#0000
(re @ibetuwill : *I will buy it, but later. It could go lower*) 
 
 Certainly.  Everyone has to decide where they want to buy.  I DCA into and out of markets over many years.  I’m DCA’ing into markets here. 

Sentiment is absolutely guttered and everyone expects lower prices .. feels terrible to buy here.  These are usually strong signals to begin taking long term positions. 

Just my opinion of course

look at the prices here, got linked to them and just trying to see their interface.. seeng the pricing and it seems crazy high compared to paideia


[12/22/2022 11:52 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Gat damn


[12/22/2022 11:52 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Well the beauty of Paideia is that the community will share in all decisions, including how much to charge, and how much is shared


[12/22/2022 11:53 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
So we can vote to charge more to initiate a Dao, and vote to spend some of that on developing new platform features


[12/22/2022 11:53 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Further increasing demand for the project


[12/22/2022 11:53 PM] fruittree#0000

[12/22/2022 11:54 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Unfortunately Paideia is out of money so ergopad has been bank rolling this


[12/22/2022 11:54 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
But we wanted to make this happen and I think it's worth it


[12/22/2022 11:54 PM] fruittree#0000
it is important for ergo ecosystem to have a second layer of governance beyond the POW layer I think


[12/22/2022 11:54 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Yes absolutely


[12/22/2022 11:55 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
I think the functionality is worth it..we need it for the ergopad Dao and all projects that launch


[12/22/2022 11:56 PM] fruittree#0000
Just imagine if Americans had freedom of government how many would rather not spend 100 billion in Ukraine, and invest in a DAO governance solution like paideia.. crazy amounts of money go into governments.


[12/22/2022 11:56 PM] marty_ergopad#0000

I haven't been able to play with the Paideia app. I keep getting the message "Please add Paideia tokens to participate". 

I get the same add tokens message for every DAO 

- All my tokens are currently staked - I've tried unstaking and it didn't work either
- Nautilus wallet
- Brave browser
- Yes my address is correct/same as my staking keys. Also tried sending everything to a different address
- cleared browser cache and all that stuff


[01/02/2023 11:00 PM] Bonzo#0000
Does anyone have any suggestions? maybe I'm missing something obvious.

I'd rather not restore my wallet into a new web browser


[01/03/2023 12:25 AM] mickzerofive#0000
try changing the default wallet address @Bonzo


[01/03/2023 2:36 AM] webified#0000
All my paideia tokens are vested so I can't comment on the dapp discussion.

I was going to suggest that instead of offering a discount on the current market price, perhaps a bonus at the end of the vesting period, or a staking APY bonus if that's possible. That may still have the same affect of leading people to sell now in order to participate in the sale, so I am not sure if it would be effective. Just thoughts.


[01/03/2023 9:25 PM] Bonzo#0000
Thanks. Unfortunatly that hasn't worked.

I've tried changing the default address, sending everything to a new address and using that, even sending everything to a new wallet.

Still no luck.. very strange

Hey all, I just found out about the airdrop you guys are doing. Is it too late to join?


[01/07/2023 9:22 PM] tyja9#0000
what airdrop?


[01/08/2023 8:28 PM] Bullseye#0000
The one from announcements.  It's the second most recent message


[01/09/2023 3:00 PM] cannon#3541
Only comment on paideia site or here too?


[01/09/2023 6:40 PM] theta_decay#0000
Commenting on the Paideia platform is great, but you're welcome to comment here if you like. We love community feedback.


[01/09/2023 7:34 PM] cannon#3541
Can you put the 3 go forward options here? I don't want to put wrong info...
To complete MVP, I estimate we need about $25,000 to $30,000 in USD value to cover 2 developers for two months. There are a few options that have already briefly been discussed the chatrooms.

    Sell Paideia tokens on Spectrum from the DAO treasury (most people didn't like this idea)
    Raise funds using an Ergo Raffle
    Do an additional token sale through Ergopad with vesting


[01/09/2023 7:35 PM] cannon#3541
How many tokens in the dao?


[01/09/2023 8:26 PM] theta_decay#0000
Selling tokens on Spectrum has been removed as community feedback was unanimously against.


[01/09/2023 8:27 PM] theta_decay#0000
Current option are:
1. Raise funds using an Ergo Raffle.
2. Do an additional token sale through Ergopad, with vesting.
3. Do a direct sale, priced above market, with no vesting.
4. NFT sale.


[01/09/2023 9:29 PM] cannon#3541
So how many, regardless,  I'm curious is all...


[01/09/2023 10:37 PM] cannon#3541
Is there an update on the project that I've missed somewhere? Is the same team still in place? Is the project self-sustaining after this Development Fund is expended? I'd like to use the end tool you're developing


[01/10/2023 9:56 PM] theta_decay#0000
Double checking this one for you.


[01/10/2023 10:05 PM] theta_decay#0000
The original team is still in place, yes. We would like very much for you to make use of our toolset. It's possible you missed this announcement? Sorry a lot of our social activity is on telegram, seems I forgot to post this to discord. I'll add it now.

Yes the project with ergo smart contracts would be self sufficient once MVP is complete. Which this proposed dev fund would get us to.


[01/10/2023 10:52 PM] theta_decay#0000
The Dao reserve, marketing & airdrop still mostly remain. Some of the airdrop allocation have been distributed. So let's say still roughly 36mil held by the Dao. Plus the liquidity locked on Spectrum. But that will remain in place for the foreseeable future.

[01/12/2023 12:51 AM] QU₳Z₳R#0000
It seemed like someone involved in the project has had a lot of experience with Catalyst.
I had sent a msg to Ergnomes during that space about an idea and he recommend we connect.

yes isn't that the whole point of this software


[01/12/2023 3:17 AM] mickzerofive#0000
that we can use it ourselves for our own projects


[01/12/2023 3:17 AM] mickzerofive#0000
i know it's in testing


[01/12/2023 3:17 AM] mickzerofive#0000
was wondering when it's available for public use


[01/12/2023 3:18 AM] Chungus#0000
Wondering the same. I want a dao that invests in ergo nfts and tokens


[01/12/2023 7:05 PM] theta_decay#0000
That would be @Marty you heard speaking. Catalyst is a big goal of ours. We really want to bring this toolset to Cardano.  We're all about collaborating & would love to hear about your idea. Feel free to share here, or dm me anytime, if you prefer.


[01/12/2023 7:15 PM] Marty#4039
DAO creation will be released with MVP and smart contracts 

If you have your own token already we can put one up that allows discussion


[01/12/2023 7:26 PM] QU₳Z₳R#0000
I've been in project catalyst since fund one. Was part of the circle, and am on challenge teams and so I'm pretty close to the IOG catalyst team.
The next fund will begin after we do something called a special voting event.


[01/12/2023 8:08 PM] QU₳Z₳R#0000
And optimistic governance directly addresses one of the parameters that's maintained by IOG, so there's a lot of opportunity ahead of you


[01/12/2023 8:21 PM] theta_decay#0000
That's awesome. Happy to have you here with us. Do you have a link you can share that describes the Special Voting Event?

Through #Paideia, DAOs will be able to:

✅ Have a forum for stakeholders to discuss ideas and proposals
✅Distribute governance tokens 
✅Manage their treasury
✅Raise funds
✅ Initiate and manage staking contracts
✅ Create proposals on expenditures or governance

and more..👀

[01/16/2023 7:59 PM] theta_decay#0000
Ok, looks like you're staking tx's are being refunded. So you are not loosing the staking tx fee that you pay. Can you try unstaking again, but this time don't unstake the total amount. Try leaving 11 paideia tokens instead of unstaking all.

Hey guys... what's the ETA for folks to use/test paideia? I see Walrus has a DAO on there... thx in advance. I don't want to reinvent the wheel on a project I'm considering for ergo hack. Thx


[01/21/2023 11:19 PM] Marty#0000
Do you mean create their own DAO in the web2 demo, or full MVP?


[01/22/2023 12:39 AM] cannon#0000
Demo would be fine (I presume that's what walrus did) I think. Appears the MVP is a bit away, yes?


[01/22/2023 6:24 PM] theta_decay#0000
Testing is open now. If you have a token, we can create a dao for you, & your token holders can create proposals & discussions.

I'm liking chat GPT.  Just thought I'd share this:


[01/27/2023 5:37 AM] quirk220#0000
DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) have the potential to disrupt traditional corporations by allowing for decentralized decision making and ownership. The use of blockchain technology enables transparency and immutability in record keeping and decision making, potentially making the process more efficient and fair. The use of smart contracts also allows for automated execution of agreements, further increasing efficiency. The success of DAOs would depend on their ability to attract and retain a significant number of participants and to provide value to those participants. Paideia, being a tool suite for dao governance, is an important development for the ecosystem. However, it's worth noting that the success of a dao also depends on the legal and regulatory environment and how it evolves.

[01/31/2023 7:31 AM] Luivatra#0000
(re @FlyingPig_69 : *What are the features of Paideia MVP? vs what would be in the backlog? (milestones)*) 
 
 - creation of dao (duh!)
- staking
- profit sharing
- standard governance
- basic proposals
- following actions:
  - send funds from treasury to address
  - change dao config
- following values are configurable:
  - staking emission per staking period
  - staking period length
  - staking delay in number of periods (stakers will receive rewards first when this delay has passed)
  - profit share pct (how much goes to stakers and how much to treasury)
  - quorum threshold
  - majority threshold (should a vote only win if fe. 60% vote for it)
  - whitelisted proposal types
  - whitelisted action types
  - whitelisted tokens for profitsharing (so you dont end up with something like Comet)
  - update contracts for the different parts of paideia (a dao will decide for themselves if they want to upgrade when a new version of a contract is released)
  - any custom config the dao would like to use (they could refer to these configs in their own contracts for example)
- In paideia's dao the following configs are open for change through proposal:
  - dao creation fee (erg and or paideia)
  - proposal creation fee (ergo and/or paideia)
  - dao running fee (fee per staker per staking period)
  - upgraded default/template contracts for newly created dao's


[01/31/2023 7:31 AM] Luivatra#0000
roadmap is to be decided by the dao after mvp is live, but would mostly consist of expanding the governance types, new proposal types and new action types


[01/31/2023 9:01 AM] FlyingPig#0000
Thanks for sharing, this is exactly what I was looking for.

I think people haven't understood the power of DAOs yet!


[01/31/2023 9:43 AM] fruittree#0000
I think that will only happen after they are implemented for significant purposes and it is done by responsible people.


[01/31/2023 10:15 AM] Luivatra#0000
that is because so far there are only pseudo dao's

Why create your DAO on Paideia? 

✅ Simple to use: 

The Paideia UX/UI was designed with ease-of-use in mind, removing the complexity so you can focus on what matters: participating in DAOs.

✅ Secure: 

Smart contracts written in Ergoscript maintain secure, predictable voting structures, which ensures your treasury is spent according to fair voting.

 ✅ Flexible: 

Not all DAOs have the same needs. Paideia offers various governance structures and voting mechanisms, so you can get organized in the most productive way possible.

 Inexpensive: 

Paideia is built on Ergo, so transaction fees are miniscule, and the platform fees will always remain low. You'll never pay hundreds in gas fees here.

do you have a time frame for how long it will until the community are able to make dao's?

(re @Gazza_SP : *Honestly that's the most fully complete MVP I've ever seen, hard to not call it a full product 😂*) 
 
 yeah, the only thing that could stand alone of these features is the staking and we already have that, so kinda had to build it all out. else you end up having to ask existing DAO's to move to a new solution because of some stupid thing you hadmt thought about

2) Will there be an updated 2023 roadmap? 
3) assuming you got it, you mentioned you needed roughly 2 months of dev work to finish off the MVP, assuming theres no issues your looking april (which would be cool to release dead on paideia's birthday) but dev work never goes to plan lol so may june ish i assume? can you shed any light on this?

 I'm sure someone will provide a more in depth answer but I do know they got the money to complete the MVP. Someone did an OTC so it didn't affect the DEX price.

A question for both Cardano and Ergo communities: What would you say to convince someone to join and build their projects on these blockchains?

The most interesting and appealing aspect of #DAOs is the way they can be adapted and integrated into existing organizations, startups, and projects.🤩

✨A DAO is a self-governing entity that runs on a #blockchain, which makes it resistant to censorship and any manipulation.

Hey 👀 ! Do you guys know how many DAOs are building on ergo? I love the Walrus DAO, working on my own, but would be cool to connect with more people

(re  : *<orobor> Hey 👀 ! Do you guys know how many DAOs are building on ergo? I love the Walrus DAO, working on my own, but would be cool to connect with more people*) 
 
 There will be a couple projects that will use Paideia for DAOs but not sure if there are any other DAOs yet besides WalrusDAO for NFTs


[02/10/2023 8:23 PM] FlyingPig#0000
But anyone could set one up! :)
Are the fees for creation of a new DAO, proposals etc decided?


[02/10/2023 8:57 PM] topas2000#0000
(re @tefcek21 : *There will be a couple projects that will use Paideia for DAOs but not sure if there are any other DAOs yet besides WalrusDAO for NFTs*) 
 
 It's also fair to say the current DAO's have 2-15 Members, any chance Paideia and/or Ergo can help spread the word for promoting new DAO's and building their communities?


[02/10/2023 9:55 PM] tefcek21#0000
In terms of marketing: 

- currently working and talking to a ton of Cardano media and influencers to introduce Paideia 
- getting listed on Cardano platforms, and more platforms on Crypto newsletters, Coin tracking and more 
- scheduling a lot Spaces, Interviews and Podcasts
- starting getting more visual content

Including: new artwork for updates, short explainer videos, and visual content about Paideia in general

- onboarding new projects on Ergo as the platform is getting more functions and tools in (estimated) April 
- doing partnerships and collaborations with other projects 
- new ways of community engagement and participation through Giveaways, and contests as wall as rewarded tasks where our community will be able to contribute 

From the marketing perspective I want to bring more transparency into everything as it was lacking, and we'd love to have the same transparency as we have in our codes.


[02/10/2023 9:56 PM] tefcek21#0000
Also one of the main reasons for the transparency is, that I beliebe through the feedback and suggestions of our community we can do better and have more creative ideas!


[02/11/2023 5:40 AM] fifajs4#0000
Great job, do you guys have plan about distributing fees from paideia app to stakers in future? Like staking rewards + some % fee revenue in erg or other tokens? This would be cool imo.

(re @fifajs4 : *Great job, do you guys have plan about distributing fees from paideia app to stakers in future? Like staking rewards + some % fee revenue in erg or other tokens? This would be cool imo.*) 
 
 That is part of the paideia mvp yes, 50% goes to stakers, 50% goes to treasury


[02/11/2023 6:37 AM] fifajs4#0000
Is there more info about MVP?

[02/11/2023 8:45 AM] theta_decay#0000
(re @fifajs4 : *Is there more info about MVP?*) 
 
 - creation of dao (duh!)
- staking
- profit sharing
- standard governance
- basic proposals
- following actions:
  - send funds from treasury to address
  - change dao config
- following values are configurable:
  - staking emission per staking period
  - staking period length
  - staking delay in number of periods (stakers will receive rewards first when this delay has passed)
  - profit share pct (how much goes to stakers and how much to treasury)
  - quorum threshold
  - majority threshold (should a vote only win if fe. 60% vote for it)
  - whitelisted proposal types
  - whitelisted action types
  - whitelisted tokens for profitsharing (so you dont end up with something like Comet)
  - update contracts for the different parts of paideia (a dao will decide for themselves if they want to upgrade when a new version of a contract is released)
  - any custom config the dao would like to use (they could refer to these configs in their own contracts for example)
- In paideia's dao the following configs are open for change through proposal:
  - dao creation fee (erg and or paideia)
  - proposal creation fee (ergo and/or paideia)
  - dao running fee (fee per staker per staking period)
  - upgraded default/template contracts for newly created dao's

How much would it cost to create a DAO on Paideia? And for proposals?.

I understand it won't be prohibitivly expensive but I guess it can't be too cheap either otherwise we'll be spammed with DAOs and thousands of proposals. Which might not matter but too many proposals might make the good ones be invisible.

[02/14/2023 9:54 PM] FlyingPig#0000
I can't access Paideia yet as it doesn't support cold wallet (i have latest ergowallet).

Does Paideia still display wallet address of user when we comment?


[02/16/2023 8:28 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
yes


[02/16/2023 8:28 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
well, let me confirm what happens if you give the account a name


[02/16/2023 8:29 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
yes. Even if you give the account a user name, if someone goes into your profile, they see your ergo address


[02/16/2023 8:29 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
so if you don't want to dox the address at all, use a different wallet


[02/16/2023 8:30 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
maybe we should hide that view from the front-end tbh


[02/16/2023 8:31 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
or not.. at least this way you know you're doxxing somewhat. Anyone can see on chain what people were doing


[02/16/2023 8:32 PM] Luivatra#0000
Can make it configurable?


[02/16/2023 8:32 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
true. Easy enough


[02/16/2023 8:33 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Also, you don't need to use the name "Flying Pig"


[02/16/2023 8:33 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
just make something up so it can't easily be connected to your social media presence


[02/16/2023 8:33 PM] FlyingPig#0000
I would like to contribute in discussions and have a name, but not necessarily expose my address.

I guess I could stake a tiny amount and use that to discuss but vote with the main address.


[02/16/2023 8:33 PM] FlyingPig#0000
(re @marty_ergopad : *Also, you don't need to use the name "Flying Pig"*) 
 
 I know, but it's quite useful to be consistent across social media platforms.


[02/16/2023 8:33 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
we'll work on a toggle switch


[02/16/2023 8:34 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
the issue is it wouldn't make sense to hide the number of tokens the person has


[02/16/2023 8:34 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
once the platform is live, you want to know how much skin they have in the game when discussing decisions


[02/16/2023 8:34 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
and if we show the number of tokens you have, it would be easy to ascertain what your wallet address is


[02/16/2023 8:36 PM] FlyingPig#0000
Yeah, i can understand that. It's valid point and a difficult topic.

We should discuss as a community ;)

Once I get home I'll create a discussion.

 clever solution


[02/16/2023 9:04 PM] lyndonb#0000
What does Paideia on Cardano look like in terms of tokens issued?

Will new tokens be issued for the Cardano blockchain (and essentially be separate to the Ergo tokens?) or will a portion of the existing tokens on Ergo (from say the Paideia treasury) be wrapped onto Cardano using rosenbridge? If the later does this mean existing Paideia holders will be exposed to revenues from both chains?

Issuing a new token would be weird tbh. It’s like instant inflation of x%


[02/16/2023 9:51 PM] Ankienator#0000
How would that work? Would say 200m paideia be on Cardano and 200m on Ergo? I thought it was hard capped at 200m. Is it still the same project? From an investors perspective, are the prices linked?


[02/16/2023 10:01 PM] FlyingPig#0000
Man, I'm trying my hardest here to join paideia. Set up a new address, but no ledger support in nautilus to authenticate.

for instance, there could be discounts on the new token, or automatic airdrop to paideia holders on ergo

 This could look like a 100% dilution, but it also provides funding access to a significantly larger market


[02/16/2023 10:23 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
if it sells for higher on ada than on erg, that means the project valuation goes up. If we provide a way for someone to transfer from PAI on erg to CPAI on cardano, maybe it could link the token values somehow


[02/16/2023 10:24 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
we've never done something like this before, but now is a good time to figure out how to do it in the most fair way


[02/16/2023 10:45 PM] ChrisHobotnica#0000
would offering convertibility between cPAI & PAI be valuable for PAI holders?


[02/16/2023 10:46 PM] lyndon_b#0000
From my perspective as a Paideia investor on Ergo, having the current token across both Blockchains and the potential revenue from both is my preference. Price would likely  end up being driven more from Cardano through arbitration across the blockchains. 

I'm by no means across the details of what dual Blockchain use looks like in practice


[02/16/2023 10:46 PM] ChrisHobotnica#0000
if so, a vote could be put to PAI holders as whether to increase token supply by offering a convertible CPAI offering


[02/16/2023 11:01 PM] ChrisHobotnica#0000
This kind of arbitrage link should reduce poor cousin token (based purely on liquidity differences between ADA & ERG) & that PAI holders who funded early are sufficiently rewarded for pre-mvp investment

I want to map out some of the underlying conflict of interests I see.. so we have the bias of being holders of Ergo PAI, we want what is good for us financially. 

While Team and Devs might have a Bias to maximize available funding for development and management. Maintaining the community is important for appealing to Cardano and other future investors. What are the tooling future investors want to see most, where can Paideia utility expand?


[02/16/2023 11:57 PM] Ankienator#0000
Interesting discussion, is this on paideia as well? "How to launch fairly on Cardano? With supplying enough funding for development and management, and benefitting early investors"
In here there are already two things at the same time.

[02/17/2023 2:42 AM] Luivatra#0000
Problem is though that as an ergo pai staker you cant magically get fees from cardano paideia and the paideia tool on cardano would need governance too, which would be difficult to do from ergo.

 what’s thinking on the solution here?


[02/17/2023 3:27 AM] Luivatra#0000
I guess you could say that if we use wrapped paideia on cardano as a paideia holder you can choose where you stake your paideia and where you receive fees, that should keep the price of paideia somewhat equal and be a big benefit to current holders


[02/17/2023 3:28 AM] Luivatra#0000
But that would mean putting a lot of trust into the bridge


[02/17/2023 3:48 AM] ChrisHobotnica#0000
Wondering would users move (c)PAI back & forwards, or once released, settle on personal preference weightings between the chains with price arbitrage emerging as the predominant PAI bridge user?


[02/17/2023 3:49 AM] ChrisHobotnica#0000
I like your idea Lui


[02/17/2023 3:50 AM] Damon#0000
Interesting convo around Cardano launch.  I have a couple questions:

 1. Will the Cardano Paideia implementation be a completely different project/entity with different team members, or instead, will it share a similar team and tech stack?  Will Cardano and Ergo users hit the same landing page and share the same user experience? 

I think this matters a bit conceptually when thinking about new tokens.  If it’s all the same team and Paideia is simply integrating a new blockchain (Cardano), then the creation of a new native token is a form of dilution for existing holders as all issued tokens ultimately square against the core team/project. 

 2.  If a new Cardano Paideia token is created, will Ergo Paideia holders benefit beyond potential price appreciation via Cardano’s larger user base? Will Cardano Paideia usage and fees be shared with Ergo Paideia holders? (Something Luivatra is speaking to here… )

When I took a position in Paideia I was investing in the team and project; I assume their efforts/success will reflect directly on my percentage share in the project.  If my percentage share in the project is diluted through new token creation, or if *usage* of the project across chains is not shared with existing holders, the investment premise changes unfavorably. 

What if a 3rd or 4th or 10th blockchain is integrated into Paideia over the years as it becomes a huge success?  Will each new blockchain integration be designated an additional 200M native tokens?  Will Paideia supporters/investors be asked to buy new allocations for each blockchain integration?

My first instinct is that a native token raise will help the core team with additional funding and that having a Cardano pipeline benefits everyone.  Having tokens for each ecosystem might be easier than wrapped or bridged solutions for a variety of reasons. 

I also think that any new tokens issued that square against the core team and  <clipped message>


[02/17/2023 4:15 AM] Luivatra#0000
Frontend might look the same, but backend will be quite different on cardano, a large part of paideia is on chain, as such it isnt as much integrating a new blockchain as it is using the ideas and concepts to build a similar product on Cardano. Just look at how much time it has taken Spectrum to move to Cardano and an AMM dex is much less complex than Paideia.


[02/17/2023 4:23 AM] ChrisHobotnica#0000
(X)PAI on each blockchain sounds cleaner, & if pre-mvp backers can be honored with a reasonable airdrop, then fair too.

Shared liquidity via Bridge appears inherently more complex, though it should be considered due to deeper liquidity pools > exchange listings > adoption


[02/17/2023 4:25 AM] Genghiskhan#0000
echoing Damon and Chris here - is there any thinking around how early investors can be rewarded with the introduction of cardano paideia, such now it sounds like a completely new ecosystem?

most early investors hope to be acknowledged and not be left behind in some sense.

 Good to know.  I’m trying to think through the tokenomics perspective.  With SPF, as an example, I believe their total token distribution includes those allocated for the Cardano integration.  They’re not messing with their max supply and so early investors know what they’re getting. 

What we’re discussing here is doubling the token supply to build the same type of project on another chain and without fee share across platforms.  And if supply is doubled for Cardano .. why not again and again for new integrations down the line?

These are important questions to resolve for early investors ..


[02/17/2023 4:46 AM] Luivatra#0000
The premise of paideia on ergo doesnt change, no matter what happens on another chain. If a new token is minted on cardano it would just be completely separate from ergo. So question is, do we want it to be a single crosschain project, or 2 sister projects, one on each chain.


[02/17/2023 5:03 AM] Damon#0000
Yes, I understand but part of my investment thesis in Paideia (and Ergo) was based on notions of interoperability.  And so while the Cardano Paideia token will be completely separate in terms of the minting contract, the core team/project is still implementing. 

Example:  If I invested in a property management company in California that expanded to New York with different building codes and rental agreements, I’d still expect my share allocation in that company to remain unchanged and to absorb the increase in rental dividends as the company grows.

I’m just talking out loud here .. I don’t have a firmed up opinion quite yet, but instinctually it feels like a bad deal for early investors if new Paideia tokens (same name, same team, just different blockchain roll out) fragments for each chain. 

There are models for preferred shares and share dilution for fund raising in tradfi, that could be considered here.

out of curiosity and speaking as a layman since i dont code - but why cant tokens be issued dynamically over time according to demand? is it a technical limitation or are there other considerations? my understanding is that for a currency to perform well, it needs a bit of inflation to accommodate demand.


[02/17/2023 6:35 AM] limebread#0000
If you decide to create a new token on the Cardano site a potential solution would be airdropping the same % of tokens to existing ergoPAI holders. That’s a quite common practice on other chains when v2 tokens are created. Relying completely on Rosen bridge or other bridges is suboptimal and I’m not sure if liquidity will be sufficient. But anything else would be dilution


[02/17/2023 6:36 AM] limebread#0000
The new v2 token could be (similarly to SPF) partially native on both chains

 Airdropping a proportional percentage would create  interesting opportunities. The Paideia team could recreate their allocation on a new chain with more liquidity. Existing staker's on Ergo, wouldn't suffer from dilution. We'd see buy pressure from investors on Cardano looking to buy tokens on Ergo as a presale of sorts. Would probably still have to make it look favorable for potential Cardano investors. Maybe extended vesting time for airdropped tokens, or some yield farming period only accessible to Cardano seed investors?


[02/17/2023 8:30 AM] limebread#0000
I strongly discourage any dilution of investor shares, on other chains this would be seen as a soft rug and make bad publicity. And rightfully so imho. Generation of new funds through new public presales shouldn’t be the way to go here (except you find a solution to do so without diluting ergo side holders). If you’re going for Cardano you’re probably expecting an increase in price, and you have the initial 8% team, 3% advisors, 10% marketing allocation. Dao reserve could be used as well, if the dao decides so. here you have your funds, or was that already used?

 I agree. Keep it simple.

- devs need to eat. Raising new money means dilution one way or the other.

- Ergo side investors face dilution, but they also benefit from the new attention and work being done on Cardano side. It is just a matter of balancing the airdrop share right.

- New Cardano investors wont like buying tokens, where large share is airdropped, but they also benefit from the work done before.

Overall the pie gets bigger, and it can be a win-win-win. Just need to set the weights right.

Keep them separate. Bridge shifts focus from more important work.

one of my main issues is the bigger picture thats been mentioned before maybe im thinking too idealistic/unrealistic but, say the rosen bridge is a suceess and paideia is a success, how will other projects from other chains who like the idea of paideia be involved, it would set a weird president to have cardano paideia and ergo paideia when for example a project on flux whats to get involved. i just dont want short term solutions that could cause more issues in the future


[02/17/2023 8:59 AM] Madman#0000
A DAO vote should be initiated on the option to cross the chain or issue new tokens


[02/17/2023 9:04 AM] theta_decay#0000
Everyone, please keep in mind that we are all members of the Paideia dao. The decision making power & responsibility rests squarely on our shoulders.


[02/17/2023 9:22 AM] muffinator#0000
but i also resonate the point of a diluted token pool doesn't sound great, but my possible thoughts would be,
 
an equal airdrop/a vested token airdrop? so my position is still the same would be great or half aridrop half staker price i would be okay with (i dont massively like the idea of having to invest more but if the price is good i wouldn't be apposed)
 
 a cool idea would be a buy back so you can resell them to cardano like 100m ergo and 100m cardano (would you use ergopad for this how would that work?) but depending on the prices it could be a loss which is obviously a bad idea if the goal is funding
 
 i really like the idea of shared rewards (but if my position was made equal by an airdrop i wouldn't mind the split revenue so much)
 
 i dunno the right answer the more i think about it the more i realise its going to be very tricky to please everyone but i do think the ergo investors have to come out ahead of a new cardano investor some how i mean we invested in a project coming up on a year ago and it seems unfair for a cardano investor to walk into what will be an existing project with alot of the leg work and early investment done for them 
 
 you will also be one of i imagine many ergo projects that will  be going cross chain so it would be good to lead by a good example although any new projects are being created now are in a different ergo landscape than paideia was created in


[02/17/2023 10:30 AM] limebread#0000
The problem isn’t going crosschain. Bridges and/or v2 tokens could solve this issue. The „problem“ is that they wanna raise new funds for a new product (Cardano native paideia), which… would always be connected with diluted shares of existing investors, it’s also like that in the real world. I think therefore we should also discuss whether is actually needed. Why build infrastructure on ergo and do it again on Cardano, when we could attract investors and users from Cardano or other chains through the future bridges (or CEXes) to make use of products on Ergo? Why build on ergo at the first place?


[02/17/2023 10:35 AM] limebread#0000
Offer the services to Cardano projects and DAOs, but have the backend run on Ergo. That’s what I always thought was planed ^^


[02/17/2023 10:37 AM] fruittree#0000
Yeah I think you are correct that one of the issues to address is that dev funds are drying out as it is then we resort to spending the paideia DAO reserves and then how far does that get us exactly? 

It is good to outline all the factors.


[02/17/2023 10:46 AM] fruittree#0000
I think it is a good time to overview the state of the project, future goals, and how this can move forward to make everyone content. A summary from the team would be helpful.

From my understanding a summary is like this:
1. We are financially set to produce the MVP. 
2. Then we can officially vote to spend DAO funds and how/ why.
3. We need to outline future tool priorities and what needs to be finished.
4. Discuss best funding options, expenses, etc.


[02/17/2023 10:49 AM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
@limebread and @muffinator,

If the project was ideological, then it would be easier to just say, let them come to ergo.

However, it is profit oriented project. Investors decide. If the way to attract profits is to expand to Cardano one way or the other, then that is the most likely scenario. 

Some way of getting Cardano users to Ergo on the backend while raising money is an interesting option though. Much less work than re-building the back end.


[02/17/2023 10:53 AM] limebread#0000

If the money is gone, say it, in that case also a company would try to raise new funds and shares of existing investors are diluted (but they profit by that the company they own is not bankrupt).

How about having this discussion on the Paideia DAO? Would love to see and have all those suggestions and feedback over there. 

Anyone here who is willing to create a discussion there? 👀

(re @limebread : *Offer the services to Cardano projects and DAOs, but have the backend run on Ergo. That’s what I always thought was planed ^^*) 
 
 Same! I always envisioned that there would be a wallet that can connect to both Ergo and Cardano dApps and allow spending in whatever token you want by using Rosen bridge in the background if necessary.


[02/17/2023 3:51 PM] m3rileo#0000
I also thought that the point of MVP was so Paideia would have a source of revenue and not need extra funding. But I understand that revenue might not be substantial if we are only tapping into the (smaller) Ergo ecosystem.


[02/17/2023 4:11 PM] Luivatra#0000
looking at how difficult it appears to be to develop on cardano we would need at least the same amount used on the ergo version to build it on cardano.

(re @m3rileo : *Same! I always envisioned that there would be a wallet that can connect to both Ergo and Cardano dApps and allow spending in whatever token you want by using Rosen bridge in the background if necessary.*) 
 
 Rosen will have a fee as part of it, if the fee is small enough something like that can be investigated, but I am not sure it is viable

(re @LuivatraEP : *looking at how difficult it appears to be to develop on cardano we would need at least the same amount used on the ergo version to build it on cardano.*) 
 
 Multiply that by 10 😂


[02/17/2023 4:20 PM] limebread#0000
(re @Gazza_SP : *Multiply that by 10 😂*) 
 
 Actually that’s my fear as well. That funds will not be enough again and development on Cardano will block all other development (whatever will be needed)

(re @LuivatraEP : *Rosen will have a fee as part of it, if the fee is small enough something like that can be investigated, but I am not sure it is viable*) 
 
 Rosen is supposedly going to be VERY slow from what I understand. Reliable and secure, but slow (which is fine).

I'd be happy to support the team building on cardano, even if that means raising more funds. 
Cardano community has deep pockets and if they can see and use the ergo version they'd probably flock to support the cardano version.

As much as anyone hates it, Ergo, at this point, is Cardano's playground :)

[02/17/2023 4:33 PM] fruittree#0000

How about just connecting Cardano wallet for the current web2 version.

If Cardano peeps want on-chain voting, then the daos there can create mirror tokens on Ergo.

Then market that as Cardano DAO tooling 😁


[02/17/2023 4:49 PM] fruittree#0000
I thought similar, but there is the additional goal to get more funding for development i think


[02/17/2023 4:50 PM] fruittree#0000
I'd like to see the overall goals stated clearly, otherwise I am useless and other people are talking passed one another.


[02/17/2023 5:24 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
I want to offer some clarifications. 

Paideia raised around $200k, mostly in Ergo. Some of that is on spectrum as liquidity. The ergo slowly lost value over time, and all of the funds were spent on development. They covered four developers and a UX/design team.


[02/17/2023 5:24 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
After the funds ran out, for several months the ergopad treasury covered those expenses


[02/17/2023 5:25 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Recently, we were fortunate enough to make an OTC sale of 7M Paideia tokens. That should cover us to MVP around April


[02/17/2023 5:26 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
The plan to expand to cardano includes new fund raising. We need to hire a new dev team (I have some excellent devs in mind), and cover those costs. Fortunately the UX is done, everything that is done for ergo besides the smart contracts is done and ready to go..it can run on the same servers and be maintained by the same people


[02/17/2023 5:26 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
If we were to dilute say 1:1 by minting 200M more tokens on cardano, and we raised funds there, your token value wouldn't be cut in half. The valuation of the entire enterprise would also more than double


[02/17/2023 5:26 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Cardano is a huge ecosystem


[02/17/2023 5:27 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
The question is, how can we raise enough funds on the cardano side, actually make it a good deal for new contributors, while also ensuring its fair to the current ones


[02/17/2023 5:27 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
You all


[02/17/2023 5:30 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Damon mentioned some ideas from tradfi like convertible debt. There's SAFEs, warrants. You can emulate similar things with crypto


[02/17/2023 5:30 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
I think ideally we'd like to do this at some point around the time of MVP so we can see how many people are using Paideia, which would actually give us some data on the intrinsic value of the platform


[02/17/2023 5:31 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Then we can do some real calculations on the most fair way to follow through with this


[02/17/2023 5:52 PM] FlyingPig#0000
There's also a limited number of projects on ERGO right now that need a DAO.

To your point, Cardano has 1000s of projects and a huge community. Expanding will inevitably benefit both chains.

 Maybe rebuilding the backend is not the best use of resources.

Cardano peeps probably would not even notice the web2 - web3 difference.

 There is some truth to this. Many would not object. In fact, many fellow Cardano community members I've interacted with would prefer making the on-chain aspect invisible to the average user.

How do I get #Paideia (https://twitter.com/hashtag/Paideia?src=hashtag_click) tokens?

1. Create an Ergo wallet https://ergoplatform.org/en/get-erg/#Wallets

2. Mine some ERG or acquire it on an exchange https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/buying-guide/

3. Go to http://app.spectrum.fi (https://t.co/DNh9Ab3X6F)

4. Trade your ERG to Paideia tokens

 Don't forget to stake them at https://ergopad.io/staking/paideia (https://t.co/oGBaBdGGo0)

(re @ibetuwill : *Does it mean that there will be another 200m Paideia on Cardano?*) 
 
 This is a big decision for the Paideia Dao. Imo, it would be wrong for the team to decide this on our own.


[02/21/2023 10:15 PM] FlyingPig#0000
I would argue that the Paideia team is better placed to research options (with some community input). They know better than anyone what they are building and what their long term vision is. And they understand the differences in building on ergo vs Cardano.

1. Personally I think it will be hard and maybe even risky to rely on a bridge between the two.

2. Building it on Cardano you will need funds. There's no way the Ergo Paideia will generate enough (at least initially) to fund that.

3. As long as you keep the original investors who got you to where you are in mind when developing a plan you will be fine.

I would be fine with a new fundraising effort on Cardano involving new tokens. Ergo investors could potentially be airdropped a % based on their staked ergo amount. Lock them with a 1 year cliff.

Or have a %s be offered at a significant discount (OG Tier).


[02/21/2023 10:18 PM] FlyingPig#0000
Whatever you choose be careful what you announce. 

For example, if you're thinking of offering a discount/drop to OGs, maybe take the snapshot in advance of announcement to avoid people buying and dumping the coin...look what happened to spectrum...when they announced the initial airdrop calcs people made 1000s of transactions to grab as many SPF as they could.....luckily SPF changed their approach


[02/21/2023 10:21 PM] m3rileo#0000
^ also if they announce a discount on Cardano for OGs, people would likely sell off their Ergo PAI to buy Cardano PAI.

(re @m3rileo : *^ also if they announce a discount on Cardano for OGs, people would likely sell off their Ergo PAI to buy Cardano PAI.*) 
 
 Yes. Another great point...so many things/scenarios to think babout.


[02/21/2023 10:40 PM] tefcek21#0000
Yeah totally agreed there are so many thinks that we have to talk and discuss about before making anything public, that’s why we haven't posted or made anything public yet. 

When launching a separate token on Cardano that doesn’t mean that it is useless for the Ergo sides since it would be a great marketing step and all projects on Ergo or the total ecosystem would benefit from it. 

Paideia is a project that has great potential to onboard and represent Ergo to many other communities, and the way it is being built can be used by any project in different areas. Not only the DAO section but also some other features that we are considering to integrate and build. 

For now we are working towards the smart contracts and MVP, also on the marketing side to intrude Paideia to the Cardano folks step by step with listings, interviews and such stuff.

Can Paideia purchase something based on a proposal/vote?
Use Case:  Setting up a DAO to manage crypto investment. 
I can make a proposal that we use the treasury to buy $1million COMET. If the vote passes the smart contract will execute the purchase on spectrum? (or whatever other dex it can integrate with)?

 no idea about written tutorial but there are multiple video, but the format you used in paideai video probably will be better but maybe not that fast slower would be better

 yeah, even the paideia one is actually a bit too fast for non-english speakers. should have added a second or two for each sentence. I threw it together quite quickly.
I'll have a look to see if it's worth putting in an entry.

 i have no experience in those things
but for 300erg i think it is worse it 
also you can use most of paideai video (after the dao vote on a spend/ buy asset ) they use the multisig so multiple member can sign it .....

It's a little strange that Project Catalyst is paused, and that the treasury isn't funding #Cardano projects with $ADA anymore. 

From my current understanding there's a community vote coming before the next Catalyst round.

We are in a bear market, projects need funded now.

For running a business a big part I think of is expense reports, kind of like itemized transaction history. I don't know the exact words I am looking for but I am familiar with using GNU Cash for example where I can overview balances and expenses. 

Seems similar work to what lui made to connect to koinly for tax reporting, is that right?

Is it also as important in others eyes as it is in mine for making businesses in a DAO functional?

I'd like to suggest that latest activity log provides ability click the entry and go to that discussion/comment/proposal. Right now I can see that people commented/liked/followed a discussions, but I have to then scroll through all the proposals/discussions to find the actual discussion.

 That would work. You might not get a lot now but once MVP opens up it would be great to have a support structure in place for bugs and feature requests


[03/02/2023 5:39 PM] FlyingPig#0000
Last thing you want is 100s of comments in telegram/discord. Becomes hard to track.


[03/02/2023 5:40 PM] tefcek21#0000
For MVP there will be 100% one, some options would be to whitelist active user and give them the opportunity to go through the MVP before others so we can eliminate some before

<Luivatra> Paideia:
- Finalizing Alpha version of paideia-sdk. Expected done during next week followed by some simple api work surrounding it.
- Next step is internal testing on the alpha version
- Any urgent issues will be resolved in beta version
- Beta version will be a public test
- Any important issues found during beta will be fixed in MVP version.
- Setup automatic running of tests on github and package deployment from the main branch. The main branch is also protected from direct commits, any developer worth his salt knows you never ever commit straight to the main branch

Will project IDO treasury holdings become visible at Paideia MVP release? I believe this along with roadmaps & deliverables that are assigned a funding budget will open up project transparency - ideal for deeper pockets & discerning investors.


[03/14/2023 1:19 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
Likely at MVP people will be more cautious with this level of funds


[03/14/2023 1:19 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
I can't speak for other projects but Paideia will be putting all the Dao managed Paideia tokens into the Dao


[03/14/2023 1:22 AM] ChrisHobotnica#0000
Does that mean projects will have a choice to toggle on/off treasury holdings?


[03/14/2023 1:26 AM] ChrisHobotnica#0000
I noticed EXLE wasn’t featured on Paideia yet… is this something individual projects initiate themselves or are they waiting on certain additional functionality?

[03/14/2023 3:22 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
I would suggest for projects like EXLE the community can encourage them to create a DAO on the platform at least to allow for discussion

 Do we have any whale voting issues? If not it shouldn't be too alarming..


[03/14/2023 6:47 PM] FlyingPig#0000
The reaction was more about putting all your eggs in MVP...

As long as there's a redundancy of MVP has issued it's all good.

Which I'm sure they have.


[03/14/2023 6:47 PM] fruittree#0000
ok


[03/14/2023 6:48 PM] FlyingPig#0000
As for whale issues, pretty sure the largest whales are the team themselves right now.


[03/14/2023 6:49 PM] FlyingPig#0000
Plus a few dwarf sperm whales here and there


[03/14/2023 6:57 PM] fruittree#0000
Are there specific species for good or bad whales? killerwhale or ?


[03/14/2023 6:59 PM] Luivatra#0000
we will be running a beta before mvp


[03/15/2023 3:58 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
Even still, if the community wants us to add the tokens slowly, we can


[03/15/2023 4:00 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
also the community will have to decide if we use optimistic governance with a whitelisted management team or open governance where anyone can make proposals


[03/15/2023 4:00 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
And elevate discussions to proposals

Forwarded from ErgoBridgeBot: <Luivatra> Paideia:
- close to being done with the alpha sdk: https://github.com/paideiadao/paideia-sdk/pull/17
- Fixing formatting along the way and adding scaladoc comments generated by chatgpt (not perfect but better than nothing at this point in time)
- Once done will work on finalizing the API and code to bootstrap alpha version hopefully next week.
- Expect to run alpha internally for a few weeks and fix whatever issues come up. Once sort of stable I will bootstrap a beta version and invite reviewers and testers alike to have a go at breaking it

As many of you have probably discovered and looked at our platform and how the demo currently appears, I simply wanted to repost a video to highlight how Paideia will look in the feature with upcoming features and tools. 

Even the mobile version, as shown in the video below, is very simple to use and ideal for engaging in proposals and discussions whether on the road, on vacation, or wherever you are right now. 👀

Any and all input is welcome and greatly appreciated. 👨‍🚀

Can you walk thru the mechanics of staking via paideia? Member stakes tokens for 90 days... tokens never leave wallet OR tokens deposit in SC that forwards to designated mutisig wallet DAO sets up?

“Hi Noah,

Yes very interested in the crypto space. Only looking at the dao for helping facilitate discussion between internal team for now. Give everyone a fair equal vote and say on behind the scenes decisions. Distribute equity down the road etc. 

Do you have some experience in this space?

How do we know if ppl r ponzi apps on ergo


[03/21/2023 6:32 PM] AlexisE#0000
Most of these projects on Ergo or almost each one is legit and known, on Paideia we'll have a verified section or mark for each project, are you looking for a specific one? If so, I can maybe help you out


[03/21/2023 6:33 PM] AlexisE#0000
Otherwise you should draw your own picture and research the project, github, open source tech, tokenomics, updates and so on, activity on their socials


[03/21/2023 6:34 PM] AlexisE#0000
There are also some platforms where you can do some research on some projects and get a better overview such as ergcube.com

[03/21/2023 6:37 PM] FlyingPig#0000
Ergo is too small to attract Ponzi apps right now. All apps have a purpose or are made for fun/learning with no malicious intent.

But once we go mainstream....I guess we will attract all sorts of crap.


[03/21/2023 6:38 PM] stro#0000
Hm I agree


[03/21/2023 6:38 PM] stro#0000
But also some ppl could be lookin to get in while it’s small. If they had malicious intent they could easily succeed


[03/21/2023 6:38 PM] stro#0000
I guess I was just asking cuz a lot of chain don’t have open source development


[03/21/2023 6:39 PM] stro#0000
Most proprietary software that is hidden and has back doors in it 😂


[03/21/2023 6:40 PM] AlexisE#0000
On Ergo we have a lot open-source stuff haha, btw. we have a really active and great community that will help out on whatever platform, I bet you will get more support than you have been asking for 😂


[03/21/2023 6:42 PM] AlexisE#0000
Agreed, on Telegram and Discord there are a lot scammers, trying to scam people in Ergo communities, but project wise it would be hard for them, as it's a smaller community and everyone immediately would get some information about a possible scam

 How do I get Paideia (https://twitter.com/hashtag/Paideia?src=hashtag_click) tokens?

1. Create an Ergo wallet https://ergoplatform.org/en/get-erg/#Wallets

2. Mine some ERG or acquire it on an exchange https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/buying-guide/

3. Go to http://app.spectrum.fi (https://t.co/DNh9Ab3X6F)

4. Trade your ERG to Paideia tokens

 Don't forget to stake them at https://ergopad.io/staking/paideia (https://t.co/oGBaBdGGo0)

Was laying out an example/scenario... how does the staking work?  Via SC and tokens leave member wallet or something else?


[03/22/2023 9:52 AM] MDMTXO#0000
yes the tokens leave the wallet but you receive a staking key


[03/22/2023 10:06 AM] tefcek21#0000
(re  : *<cannon> Was laying out an example/scenario... how does the staking work?  Via SC and tokens leave member wallet or something else?*) 
 
 You visit ergopad.io/staking/paideia. Then you can stake a specific amount there, once you fill out the form for that, you have to sign the transaction and your tokens will leave the wallet, you will then receive a staking key in which your tokens will be locked in. If you have a staking key you can manage it through the ergopad staking tab, you can add more tokens into your staking key and stake more, or can withdraw a specific amount of tokens of your staking key.


[03/22/2023 10:07 AM] tefcek21#0000
(re  : *<cannon> Was laying out an example/scenario... how does the staking work?  Via SC and tokens leave member wallet or something else?*) 
 
 and yeah everything is based on smart contracts, and you have the fully control over your tokens, they are basically stored in your wallet locked in staking keys, thanks to our superstar @LuivatraEP

Forwarded from ErgoBridgeBot: <Luivatra> Paideia-mvp:
- Finished the alpha versions of the contracts
- Been working on preparing the setup surrounding AvlTrees to be able to handle mempool and multiple bot operators potentially pushing conflicting transactions
- Ran into an issue that took some time to figure out (when copying an empty AvlTree the root node was marked as new causing it to be included in a generated proof)
- Refactored the staking code to be blockchain centered instead of off chain centered, mostly to deal with the multiple bot operator situation.
- Expect to begin alpha testing beginning of next week
- From beta version will start locking contract versions into compiled ergotree instead of just using ergoscript to avoid potential issues arising with future ergoscript compilers

Create proposal 2$ in Paideia + 0.5 erg

Staking 0.01 Paideia per staker per epoch + 0.00001 erg per staker per epoch

 We haven't finalised. Please add your thoughts


[03/23/2023 6:01 PM] abhishekpc3po#0000
yeah we need to revisit charts


[03/23/2023 6:01 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
I was thinking we'd make it $100 to create a Dao


[03/23/2023 6:16 PM] FlyingPig#0000
(re @marty_ergopad : *I was thinking we'd make it $100 to create a Dao*) 
 
 I guess it needs to be cheaper than the alternatives. I'm not that educated in other DAOs but Aragon charges 0.2 eth + gas fees I believe. 

You'll should lay out your unique selling points and differences with other DAOs. Why should I use Paideia on Ergo and not X on chainY?

In the beginning perhaps the fee should be cheaper since the first DAOs will be working off an MVP. Once you add more features price should increase (through discussions/proposals and voting).


[03/23/2023 6:17 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Compared to others it's quite cheap but you're right that we should start low for the initial adopters


[03/23/2023 6:18 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
A balance between low enough that people will use it, and high enough that the platform can sustain itself


[03/23/2023 6:24 PM] FlyingPig#0000
(re @marty_ergopad : *A balance between low enough that people will use it, and high enough that the platform can sustain itself*) 
 
 Agree. You would know better what you need to sustain in the platform in terms of infrastructure fees etc.
I think a lot of core/original ergo projects are waiting for the Paideia so a lower initial fee to get them onboard sounds like good idea.

It's like early access. Cheaper initially and prices goes up with new features being added.

I'm super excited!


[03/23/2023 6:25 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Yeah that makes good sense


[03/23/2023 8:53 PM] GreenDog18#0000
Is the vesting period over for the seed round/ergopad rounds?


[03/23/2023 8:56 PM] MDMTXO#0000

In a few days, the staker round vesting for Paideia will be completed. Sorry guys, but I'm not feeling well today. I have a headache, and I'm also tired, so that's why I didn't do much today.

[03/23/2023 11:21 PM] GreenDog18#0000
No need to answer Alexis but a question for others. With cardano launch nothing would change with PAI token correct? It would just mean that when DAOs are created instead of the cost being in erg + pai… it would be Ada + pai? Or would there be a separate coin all together for cardano?

 I think that's one of the questions they are trying to figure out...
Is it a new token, is it bridged token (rosenbridge)......


[03/23/2023 11:43 PM] qx()#0000
Wrapped token would give the feeling more that it’s ergo centric imho.

 We are thinking of doing a separate coin but offer warrants to ePAI holders if they want cPAI


[03/23/2023 11:45 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
So you would trade in your ePAI for a favorable cPAI position. IE the discount per token would be greater than the cost of an ePAI token.


[03/23/2023 11:45 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
A warrant is essentially an option to buy in the future

(re @marty_ergopad : *So you would trade in your ePAI for a favorable cPAI position. IE the discount per token would be greater than the cost of an ePAI token.*) 
 
 So a self hosted swap on ur site?


[03/23/2023 11:45 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
At a predetermined price


[03/23/2023 11:45 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
(re @dadreboi : *So a self hosted swap on ur site?*) 
 
 Not entirely sure of the mechanism yet


[03/23/2023 11:45 PM] qx()#0000
“Portal”


[03/23/2023 11:46 PM] qx()#0000
(re @marty_ergopad : *Not entirely sure of the mechanism yet*) 
 
 Gotcha


[03/23/2023 11:46 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
But something like that is probably the case


[03/24/2023 12:39 AM] FlyingPig#0000
(re @marty_ergopad : *So you would trade in your ePAI for a favorable cPAI position. IE the discount per token would be greater than the cost of an ePAI token.*) 
 
 What does that mean?

You could swap 2 ePAI for the right to buy 3 cPAI at a discounted price?


[03/24/2023 12:43 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
If cPAI was $.10 and epai was $0.01, you could swap ePAI to get a greater than 0.01 discount off cPAI, so you'd pay less than 0.09 for cPAI


[03/24/2023 12:46 AM] FlyingPig#0000
Got it! Sounds like an interesting concept.


[03/24/2023 12:46 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
Does it seem fair?


[03/24/2023 12:47 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
We are trying to achieve a few goals at once:
- increase desirability/value of ePAI
- reduce dilution of ePAI
- raise funds for cardano development
- keep original investors happy
- prevent making new investors annoyed and reducing the desirability of cPAI


[03/24/2023 12:51 AM] FlyingPig#0000
On the face of it yes it seems fair.

We would essentially be selling our ePAI tokens for the right to buy cPAI at a price equal to the difference in price($) + X %


[03/24/2023 12:52 AM] FlyingPig#0000
It's late where I am so my brain isnt 100% alert, but I think it get it and it seems fair.


[03/24/2023 12:53 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
I think it's minus X but yes


[03/24/2023 12:53 AM] FlyingPig#0000
Yes, minus!


[03/24/2023 12:54 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
And it's a warrant which is a future contract. You can execute them in the future or allow them to expire.


[03/24/2023 12:54 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
You'll receive tokens on ada to represent this


[03/24/2023 12:55 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
Those warrants could be traded before execution, in theory


[03/24/2023 12:56 AM] FlyingPig#0000
I get it now. Of course , the devil is always in the details, but that will come in time I'm sure.

Thanks for clarifying.

Nautilus was designed from Day 1 for a multi-chain future. 

It will always be Ergocentric, when there are more open-source wallets we will look into adding/expanding Cardano support. 

Maybe try to be parallel with where Rosen Bridge expands.🤔

With #Paideia, all tokens within a DAO are locked in the treasury and cannot be moved or manipulated by anyone, in contrast to what happened with $ARB.

        This is probably the hardest part of crypto. The responsibility for keeping your funds safe lies on the owner. 
If you get scammed, the money is gone, no way to get it back.

In banking etc, there are ways to get your funds back and often (but not always) the funds are returned or the banks will refund it.

Not sure how to solve it other than us, the community, educating new users on how to keep your keys safe.
Wallets etc should have "warnings galore" around how to keep safe. Maybe even force users to watch, read more info about security.
I'm sure many will ignore, but if we can prevent just one scam it might be worth it.

:(


[04/03/2023 8:54 PM] qx()#0000
we need to promot buffer wallets


[04/03/2023 8:54 PM] qx()#0000

[04/03/2023 8:54 PM] qx()#0000
you don't go out on the street with your entire life savings in your back pocket, crypto should be no different


[04/03/2023 8:54 PM] qx()#0000
make a wallet for your daily tx's


[04/03/2023 8:55 PM] qx()#0000
only ever connect that to a web plugin


[04/03/2023 8:56 PM] qx()#0000
i like the mneonomic password method....


[04/03/2023 8:56 PM] FlyingPig#0000
yeah, that's probably the best way to handle this.
You should keep 90% of your holdings in a cold ledger or mobile wallet.


[04/03/2023 8:56 PM] qx()#0000
make a wallet with satergo and use a mneonomic password for the creation of the wallet.


[04/03/2023 8:56 PM] FlyingPig#0000
And that wallet should only transfer to your "hot", daily tx wallet, no where else.


[04/03/2023 8:56 PM] qx()#0000
put your funds in the wallet with the mneonomic password


[04/03/2023 8:56 PM] qx()#0000
then, take the seed phrase MINUS the mneonomic password and restore that wallet


[04/03/2023 8:56 PM] qx()#0000
it's a different wallet


[04/03/2023 8:57 PM] qx()#0000
so now you have two wallets, same seed, but the big guy has the mneonomic password added


[04/03/2023 8:57 PM] FlyingPig#0000

✨Voting on Paideia: 

It will not be able to cast multiple votes with the same tokens, as you will be required to lock your staked tokens within a wrapped voting key until the proposals are closed.

Therefore, you will be required to convert your staking key into a vote key; even so, you will continue to receive staking rewards while your tokens are locked until a proposal you voted for is closed.


[04/04/2023 10:45 PM] tefcek21#0000

Lui showed us a demo today at the team meeting. What a huge undertaking


[04/05/2023 12:25 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
he utilizes AVL trees in most areas, and most features can be customized by DAO vote


[04/05/2023 12:26 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
So rather than being a smart contract that cannot be changed once you deploy, everything can be modified by config contracts (locked by DAO votes always)


[04/05/2023 12:29 AM] FlyingPig#0000
It genuinely sounds like a work of art and that lui and team (or is it just lui?) has thoroughly thought through most scenarios and concerns...

The beauty of developing in a bear market....you can focus on functionality and security. No one is banging on about releasing things quickly and pumping prices.


[04/05/2023 12:31 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
It has been a group effort conceptually but Lui has wrote all on chain and much of the off chain code


[04/05/2023 12:31 AM] marty_ergopad#0000
then Noob has done a ton of the backend. And trapper and I wrote the frontend

1/ Today, the U.S. Treasury published its DeFi Risk Assessment.

Imo, it's one of the most consequential U.S. pronouncements on crypto since the DAO Report (maybe more important)

Your favorite lawyer-turned-web3 startup founder read it so you don't have to.

Let's dig in.

It's been almost a year I think since the IDO, and what happened in between is just making me even more excited about the future, it's too early to retire now wait for the Cardano launch, and maybe who knows soon crosschain DAO toolkit?

Check it out!

Hello guys! I am from a cardano DAO called Littlefish foundation. We are creating a guide for new comers about founding DAOs, doing research about DAO tools and writing documents about them. Paideia got us really excited and we plan to write about it for our guide. I wanted to ask two questions:
- Is there a planned release time for Cardano?
- Can we assume the cardano version will have the same functionality as the Ergo version?

        We don't have a planned release for ada yet. We'll be raising the funds in the coming months. 

The cardano version should have very similar if not the same functionality as the ergo version


[04/13/2023 3:57 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
(re @marty_ergopad : *We don't have a planned release for ada yet. W...*)
        
        Could there be some streamlined version of serving Cardano DAO needs while waiting?

I guess thats the web2 version?

I am thinking, snapshot holders on Cardano, drop voting shares on Ergo. 

Cardano wallets willing to participate could signal their erg address using an nft in Cardano wallet for example. 

That would be a bit more on-chain compared to the web2.


[04/13/2023 3:58 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
If people can't wait, they could wrap their token and make a Dao on ergo easily


[04/13/2023 3:58 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Other half-measures might be worth exploring, depending on how much dev time it takes and what the end result would be


[04/13/2023 4:02 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
There are some open source smart contracts related to DAOs on cardano already..maybe can implement them as a stopgap lower featureset


[04/13/2023 4:02 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
(re @marty_ergopad : *Other half-measures might be worth exploring, ...*)
        
        I think providing that early incomplete access one way or the other would be a good idea.

The wrapping idea might be easy enough for DAOs to pick up.

Just needs a clear how-to video and article once the pieces are ready.

We've been super lax with marketing so far, but I think after April we can start pushing a lot more. I fixed up the website last night to be general and not ergo focused

        I would like it if this could be optional when creating a new DAO. Because I can imagine this leading to unwanted outcomes, such as superficial involvement vs a more genuine involvement.


[04/13/2023 8:22 PM] marty_ergopad#0000

(re @fruittree : *will Paideia be listed on the new exchange?*)
        
        i know it was discussed, i think they wanted to see volume on sigusd before they do anything else

        Potentially, I am already talking to their team and it seems like they're definitely interested as there were some demand for both ErgoPad and Paideia in their comment section

Good evening Ergoers, it's time to talk tokens! $ERG

What tokens would you like to see listed and what market would you want to trade them against?

Token/USDT ?
Token/ERG ?

or maybe even .. 
Token/SigUSD

Let us know!

have you considered adding support to cardano wallet , and cardano people use wrapped pai instead of creating a new token ?

[04/17/2023 2:55 PM] FlyingPig#0000
nope, not yet. Deposite some paideia and erg. Minimal amounts just to try things. 
will do a withdrawal later tonight to see how that works.

It uses the same address for depositing erg and paideia (and presumably ergopad) but specifically says to only deposit 0.001 erg when also transferring paideida>

Not sure what would happen if I transferred 1 erg and 1k paideia in 1 transaction.


[04/17/2023 2:57 PM] MDMTXO#0000
you can't at the same time i think , read the thread they posted for ergo

(re @FlyingPig_69 : *nope, not yet. Deposite some paideia and erg. ...*)
        
        I believe you would simply lose the 1 erg.


[04/17/2023 3:03 PM] theta_decay#0000
Or the 1k paideia. Good question.


[04/17/2023 3:03 PM] FlyingPig#0000
(re @theta_decay : *I believe you would simply lose the 1 erg.*)
        
        That's probably the case. 
I would even try because it specifically says not to do so. I was just curious, because someone will eventually do that...


[04/17/2023 3:05 PM] Pavel#0000
You have to deposit online Paideia if you want

The address is the same whether you deposit paideia or just erg.

I've asked in their discord


[04/17/2023 3:08 PM] FlyingPig#0000
I guess it does state you would lose the erg if you deposit tokens.

If I click on deposit erg, it says only deposit erg.

Still, someone will eventually deposit both and they will expect to get their erg back, best be prepared

[04/17/2023 3:11 PM] FlyingPig#0000
Doesn't say anything.

I guess the following will happen if you sent erg + tokens:

If token is paideia/ergopad/sigusd it will credit those to your account. Any erg is lost.

If you sent other tokens those would be lost (e.g. Comet)

(re @FlyingPig_69 : *Doesn't say anything.

        From 7seas support when I asked:

So if someone sent 10 erg and 10 sigusd/Paideia/ergopd, the 10 erg would be "lost" and only the token credited.

What if someone sent an unsupported token + 10 erg? Would it credit the ergo and lose the tokens?

Lots of questions, but these are things that will definitely happen, because users will always be users:) 

Response from 7seas:

Correct, but its not lost exactly. Its recoverable since its in our exchange wallet - just manual work to pull it out and wont show in the users account.

If someone sent an unsupported token + 10 erg nothing will credited

And if someone sends 2 tokens in one transaction, only the first in the transaction will be credited as its the 2x crediting per txid which we dont allow.

Long term we can restructure our database and update our code to handle these cases, which we will 100% do if, like you say, we have volume and if it becomes too much of a time sink for support to manually credit users.

When exchanges warn that coins will be lost, often thats not strictly the case - so long as they were sent to the correct address! its just a massive pain 😄

If they are going to support tokens they should do it properly. Just my opinion.

        I read the response as that they will support that IF there is volume and the depending on how many do it.

I think that's fair. They probably have limited resources being a new exchange and they want to test the waters before going all in.

(re @mewtoshi : *Why is the website TLD .im?*)
        
        Im is Isle of Man.
Low income tax, zero corp, capital gains etc.. ...

Maybe that is why?

        What is the point when there are TLDs unrelated to countries? Also, I don't think a TLD affects any of that

No idea. I was just theorizing, it's a hobby of mine :).

Someone else is probably best to answer that.

@hoskytoken @RichardMcCrackn @PaideiaDAO will have a treasury management feature. Expected to launch the MVP with this feature on Ergo in a couple of weeks, and then start building it cross-chain on #Cardano. 

A feature and a project that is still not discovered by the #Cardano ecosystem, but it's coming…

Paideia seems to be heavily undervalued - Ergopad too for that matter.  Given the ongoing reliance Ergo projects are to have on Paideia as a central organisational pillar for treasury, management, voting...

Does Paideia supersede Ergopad's valuation?

        Unique Selling Point.

It's something that your product has that no else does.

E.g. Tesla has the supercharger network...no one else can match that (yet )

        Here's another question. So I have posted my loan, but it is counted as undercollateralized since it's backed by the vesting key. How would someone verify the value of the vesting key?


[04/29/2023 6:45 PM] TIMRΣG7#0000
the token id is here https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/token/1ca92b5e84c3d0f29bc9950954b8069ae4a96d6de15af3185d2a9622e951b7c0

        ufff that a tough one
first lui has created a verify api 
but the second one is yes you can't verify if the vesting key is empty or full , half ....

i think cheese was working on nft loan try reach out if you want


[04/29/2023 6:51 PM] MDMTXO#0000
the other issue is you can't see the borrower address in loan request page , if this possible than it's easy anyone can copy address to ergopad and check the amount in taht vesting key


[04/29/2023 6:54 PM] TIMRΣG7#0000
(re @MDMTXO : *the other issue is you can't see the borrower ...*)

It was mentioned though only 1-2 minutes, but we will make sure to get discovered in another one. Rosen-Bridge brought up a discussion and a couple questions with it, a couple like thousands haha
