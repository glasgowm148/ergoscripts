Wonderful, thank you Glasgow


[11/09/2021 1:25 AM] Noah ~ 贺能#5674
Proposal looks very detailed and comprehensive to me, great! “Currently the approximate budget proposed is around 40K USD” per month, right @AngieHar ?


[11/09/2021 1:28 AM] Noah ~ 贺能#5674
To put things in perspective, 40K USD per month isn't much compared to what a lot of the garbage tokens we are "competing" with spend. But we have to start somewhere. Hopefully ERG price significantly increases soon and we can have more budget.

@AngieHar your marketing plan has been put to vote and passed by EF, approved for marketing spending of up to USDT40K per month.

In addition I strongly recommend extending with Jinse next year. We got a great relationship and have gotten far far more out of it then was strictly required per the contract. This is due to our direct relationship with the CEO and the fact he views Ergo very favorably (possibly owns a lot himself too).

Eva has had some more conversations with them past day or two and seems they are relaxed about the new rules and think we can go on publishing even with our old IDs which we were worried about. We had paid 100 ERGs for an offshore ID to use and had also stopped publishing recently.

But all that being said, there might be some risk they shut down so we will try to better assess that risk by next year when the contract would be up for extension. Seems chainnews maybe shutting down...not sure yet...Eva had been having detailed conversations with them about working with them in addition to Jinse. They don't have as many users as Jinse but probably more knowledgeable users.

Hi all, 
Hope you're doing great! 

I would like to put on vote two candidates to join our team. 

1. One of the big challenges for us is a YouTube channel and video support of our activities. You all probably know Andy. He is an active member of the community and helped us in many projects. 
In the very near future, we are introducing AMA sessions on a regular basis, also according to the plan we aim to prepare 5 explained videos to simplify complexities of Ergo. Also, the plan for the next three months is to prepare Summit in a pre-recorded format. 

I believe that Andy's candidacy is the most suitable and he is as motivated as possible. I propose to vote for his candidacy for the role of video manager for YouTube initiatives. I am enclosing his CV for consideration with the proposals that we have previously discussed with him.

According to the terms, we negotiated his contribution of 20 hours a week with an hourly payment of 35 sigUSD/hour

[11/18/2021 4:44 PM] AngieHar#0865
2. One more ask is to consider marketing/process manager to help with marketing initiatives and communications

Matthew Hinton is also a part of our community, he has been texting me for the last months pointing out small mistakes and provide with possible solutions. I believe we are on the same page with him in regards to organization and management, as well as he has relevant background so he is highly motivated to work behind the scenes and assist in marketing, project management, community management, event management, support and processes - so all the batch is here. 

According to the terms, we negotiated his contribution as a full time job/ or part time depending on the amount of tasks. I propose to approve him for a test period with a hourly rate of 33 USDT/hour. After a probation period of 2 months we could reconsider him for a full time position

Attaching his CV and a list of skills

[03/08/2022 2:45 PM] AngieHar#0865
Hi all, 

We have a proposal from out partners GTON to participate in their event in Dubai 
29-31 march 

This event is mostly devoted to development and mostly a networking event to make new partnerships 
We customized an offer for Ergo and negotiated a discount, as there is an opportunity to make a hackathon sponsored by Ergo

Besides, we will have opportunity for cross marketing with a listed sponsors apart of promo materials
it's something around 500K Twitter subscribers 

they aim at 700-1000 visitors at this event 

you can see listed sponsors here https://www.ethdubaiconf.org/#sprs
and schedule for three days here https://www.ethdubaiconf.org/#schedule

and the offer here https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XJpsKfJhPmWrciGvEcIqN92IGjFBDs4IuJ7zqz3FaHU/edit#slide=id.p

1. Hackathon sponsors with marketing materials 
5K organization fee
5K prizes ( can be increased) 
Coverage:

> Linked Logo on conference website
> Special thank you tweet
> Hackathon and promo materials 
> Conference tickets for 4 members

= 10K ( min) 

2. Additional: party attend
Sponsored by: Gnosis, CertiK, Quick node, Zerion, Immunefi, and a few pending 

+ marketing materials 

5K 

So all in all 15K 

Daniel is able to attend by himself, or we still have 3 free tickets. 

Please let me know your thoughts, if there is something we can consider. We are a bit restricted in timing so hope to hear from you as soon as possible.

Details for ETHD hackathon 

- Our team povides with tasks for the participants and announce the prize fund.

- Their team arrange for posts to let the participants know about our track. We will share the announcement with our and their community too, perhaps, some of the people will be in Dubai that time. They’ll also promote the hachathon in GTON Capital channels for, as we agreed before, Shamil will be there ready to work as an expert and help the devs with the tasks.

- The parrticipants apply to fulfil our tasks in commands or solo. 

- The hachathon starts remotely on the 26th of March and people are working remotely till March 30. During this time we're consulting the devs in Discord or Telegram.

- March 30: developers can come and hack offline at the ETHDubai venue, they will also be able to meet our team and Shamil in person. It is assumed that the sponsor's team (and Shamil in our case) work with the devs to help them with their projects.

- March 31: hackathon continues. In the evening the participants present their demos, the judges pick the winners and award them ( judges will be mixed neutral or the sponsor's representatives, tbd)


[03/14/2022 3:04 PM] AngieHar#0865
Regarding our possible KPIs:

Attendees
 The entire conference will have ~1k attendees

Party attendees ~300

Coverage/Hack
As a sponsor we get ETHDubai twitter posts, posts in the chat and email onto attendee and onto speakers and sponsors separately.

We can also add to this accompanying coverage by the other sponsors sharing the announcements in their communities, so as was mentioned earlier cross marketing, up to 500K Twitter subscribers)

Coverage/Party
We get the same package but in relation to the party.

[04/11/2022 12:22 PM] AngieHar#0865
Hi Board, 

Wanted to share some updates on ErgoHack preparation. 
Unfortunately, we failed to launch the hackathon on the 4th of April ( as was discussed previously) due to some concept changes throughout the preparation and it was kind of naive to set two weeks for preparation as basically, it requires months for such events. However, we are trying to set everything in the shortest time frame. 

So we changed the concept of the ergohack and wanted to extend the time for participating, changed it from 3 days of activity to 3 weeks. We named it as ErgoHack Festival this time. 
This Festival is devoted to our ecosystem's projects to help them onboard new memebrs and resolve possible issues in development. And there is also a path to develop something new in borders of DeFi topic. 

ergohack.io is partially updated
i hope to complete it today with tasks and some changes in intro texts 

The Festival schedule is as: 
- 1 week for devs to communicate their ideas and solutions 
- 2 weeks of development with intermediate reports 
- Promo week of ecosystem's project on Youtube 
- Presentation 

We set a goal to increase the amount of teams ( from the previous time) and have from 13-20 teams overall, it's around 100-120 signups 

In order to meet the stated KPI's we need to run a promo campaign to advertise Ergo Hackathons and attract more members to the ecosystem. 
For this purposes I chose several channels as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn to start promoting not just through internal channels but also through paid promotion. 

After conducting everything, I got an offer from one marketing agency to help in buying slots for such activities. Since we are limited in time, we will need around three weeks to promote the event through social media channels having one week as a test.


[04/11/2022 12:25 PM] AngieHar#0865
So I would like to share the proposal that I would like to use for marketing ErgoHack Fest in boarders of our stated budget ( that previously was 10K a month) 
the proposal covers all needed platforms to collect the amount of people we need via Twitter Facebook and LinkedIn + using direct telemarketing 
and Additionally to seed a PR announcement for some relevant media platforms that is always good for brand awareness 

the full proposal is attached 

I highly need your confirmation that you're okay with such approach and we can move further as soon as possible

Reference page 9 of the PDF proposal, do we feel comfortable giving them login access for Twitter?


[04/13/2022 1:42 AM] Noah ~ 贺能#5674
Reference page 15, I think we should not agree to Article 10 and we should ask them to remove it. It is not reasonable to expect that we agree to indemnify them against claims from third parties.


[04/18/2022 1:17 AM] Noah ~ 贺能#5674

Looks okay, what's the $3k - website promo actually for though?


[04/26/2022 3:47 PM] glasgowm#9381
and what's "crypto traders impressions" ?


[04/26/2022 3:54 PM] AngieHar#0865
website promo includes mostly costs for PR publications ( but since the launch is postponed i will move the cost forward 
> crypto traders impresssion - this is just a description of possible retargeting campaign to run in the future. it is kind of effective way of advertising targeting specific audience anywhere in social media or even in ads ( including google ads and facebook), many blockchains uses such kind of advertising, so it's no context but more specific


[04/26/2022 3:57 PM] glasgowm#9381
Website is pretty much good to go btw, was going to put it live for indodax but then they announced unexpectedly. Still some css fixes on various resolutions but ready to put into production pretty much now (will ask dev to start this process and check redirects, etc). 

So should I just put it live ASAP or do we want to time it with anything else?

@kushti @AngieHar You might consider whether there is some way to do more marketing in Russia. It occurs to me crypto is down even more in rubles than in dollars and with a lot of the team being based in Russia, it might make sense in this terrible market to market more to Russians. But I totally defer to you and understand you may not want to push it in Russia for a variety of reasons like regulatory etc. But just a thought. 

Too bad Sasha seems totally focused on Waves. Would be nice if he could start promoting Ergo more.

@ergo_whale @sigmanaut Is there way how to promote his YT chanel ? This is where money on marketing should be spent.
Twitter


[07/24/2022 7:44 AM] Justin1000#9555
This sounds good to me in principle. It's frustrating to see all the great content created but not enough views because Ergo isn't on all the big exchanges. 

Doubtful we have money for this now but if it was just a matter of couple thousands dollars to drive many thousands of views CWs videos and some others might still be worth it.


[07/26/2022 9:30 PM] CW#8500
I tend to agree regarding it being good in principle and share the same frustration when people (even miners leading up to Eth Merge) saying they need/require/prefer Ergo on Binance.

With the videos we will reach critical mass with them. I'm just trying to get a heap of easily digestable vids ready for the Merge and when sentiment turns around. 

The "what is ergo" vid has just shy of 3k views in less than a week. 90% of which are from YT recommendations.

The "how to install a node" has seen some good engagement 

It's also difficult growing a channel from scratch. Especially in a bear market. 

I'll keep churning them out and let the community spread the word so when sentiment turns around we have a fair bit of content ready

I have a few questions to discuss regarding the upcoming hackathon. 

So the next hackathon is planned for 3-10 October ( it's preliminary dates and we are still discussing the concept) but all in all the document is ready. 

The next main point is about  the prize pool. I received a proposal from Djed Alliance to "sponsor" the event and make it in collaboration. But then it turned out that Djed is not able to provide prizes, however, we can organize some special NFT gifts. 
Additionally, I would like to discuss sponsorship possibility with FLUX since they are the latest partners, and if you have anyone in mind whom to contact in regards to possible sponsorship, please let's discuss. 

All in all,  I would like you to confirm the following to move it further: 
1. the prize pool of 18K ( as it was the previous time) 

First place: 10,000 SigUSD 
Second place: 6,000 SigUSD
Third place: 2,000 SigUSD
+ Additional prizes worth 200 SigUSD for all active participants

2. the general topic of the event ( it doesn't necessary influence the development, but helps to organise the conetent) 

there are several options for a theme: 

1. Education 
2. stability, robustness, resilience, security
3. layer 2, sidechains, interoperability

Think flux and option 3 work best given time. Also rosen should be on testnet.

It seems having an event regarding mining, and mining tools would be much more valuable given the current narrative in markets and proximity to the merge.

If we need a theme anyway that seems like the best fit.

So then making a theme devoted to mining, correct? 

And about the prize pool, it remains the same?

I want to give my periodic reminder of importance of Chinese community. I was reminded to do this when I saw how extremely active the Chinese telegram group was leading up to the Merge. Seemed at some times to have even more messages than on the English telegram. Eva has done a fantastic job and the telegram seems all to be real people she transferred over from wechat and other places when the regulations changed. Moreover, the telegram is just one group of many. 

And ERG is mainly listed on Chinese-related exchanges with Gate.io tending to be biggest volume. So please keep in mind the importance of Chinese community. Here is update Eva has done which includes basic social media metrics. 

We have a great base in China that can easily explode much more if Ergo gets more popular. Eva is really disappointed we did not continue the partnership with Jinse. I am going to give 100 of my ERGs to Tongtong there who helped us a lot. I think if ERG price goes back up, we should see if we can get the partnership going again. Probably going to have to pay more than the great deal they offered last time though.

By the way, Jinse is still operating normally despite most all other crypto media being shut down. Could be govt cleaned up space last year or so but is allowing a few exchanges and media groups to be active to keep involved in the industry in a controlled way. Okex seems likely to be their most favored exchange.


[10/09/2022 10:09 AM] Justin1000#9555
Jinse management shifted too last year as we touched on before. Probably Jinse is most favored media. Some element of speculation here though.

Thanks for the update, will check the doc when on the PC shortly

Not sure it is appropriate but Tan is asking us to follow @Sombo_Lab with our main twitter account. Think he is involved in it. I don't know anything about the project but appears to partially be PoW at least. Anyway, if no risk or downside, can consider following them just as a  favor to Tan. he has been quite helpful in the past and maybe again in the future.

No problem

I also recommend Oracles and DeFi:
-Oracles absolutely key to real world use of DeFi and financial products building on Ergo.
-Oracles v2 coming out is perfect time to get everyone focused on them and making them as robust as possible ASAP as are key building block for all the things to come next.
-If we want to scale DeFi products on Ergo to hundreds of millions and billions in single products, will need to have builders and users fully confident in the Oracles.
-So if we can convince businesses and finance/DeFi experts that Ergo oracles are robust then goes a long way to convincing them things like SigmaUSD and Dexy-Gold are robust and the infinite other products they can build on Ergo will also be robust.

The Bitmex guy I talked to said didn’t believe in any stable coins right now because of all the crap that has happened. So things like this help address that.


[12/06/2022 1:56 AM] Justin1000#9555
On a separate topic, I again think in marketing materials and other things, we should gradually start to shift more focus to making money on Ergo. **Finance is #1 source of billionaires at around 15-20% globally**. The main driver for DeFi is not going to be charity or trying to help the world but the profit incentive. Its not bad that Ergo has been building a culture of grassroots finance and projects like Exle helping out African individuals and small businesses is all great and probably the best way to start and can continue to large extent.

But I think in the long-run, its going to be the profit incentive that drives Ergo’s use and enables it to really help the world. Kushti building Dexy-Gold and having profits from reserves sent to various community projects/non-profits is great but at end of day, Ergo needs hardcore full-time profit driven professionals building on it to really flush out everything it can do and make a big robust economy. 

Its hard now when price and market is crap but when possible and especially later when things improve, I think we should highlight how people are making money and other ways they might possibly make money on Ergo.
