Happy hackathon! I am currently looking for a team of passionate vounteers to help with this proposal.

Ergo Family Banners (EFB) is a proposal that seeks to harness the established talent, support, and energy of the Ergo community in a way that allows all participants to actively engage in the building and support of the Ergo ecosystem, regardless of expertise. Utilizing NFTs created by established Ergo artists, and governance structures within the Paideia framework, EFB will be the 1st truly non-profit, community funded and driven NFT project in the space in its efforts to keep ERGO for the people and by the people.

I get the `Why` but a bit unclear about the `How` - what would these families be doing?


[05/12/2022 3:08 PM] glasgowm#9381
is this incubator a virtual space?

Thanks for the questions

Let me preface my answer by saying that my experience is in community organizing, not web development, programming ,etc... but I'm learning. The beauty in my lack of knowledge is that it forces it to be a community project.

The answer to what each individual family would be doing would be ultimately up to them, as they would be self-governed catalysts for their respective areas of interests. It could weigh towards  more social engagement and idea incubator, funding projects, developing tools, etc. The initial goal is to organize users and provide a way to seed fund treasuries they can utilize to support missions. From what I have read and watched, I believe that Paideia could provide the tools for initial governance structures and DAO.

I think having a virtual space for social engagement would be a key component of its success. How that grows and develops would be left to the community to decide. Having the basic framework for social engagement (Discord, website) would be the limit of my capabilities. However, with support and a team, I believe it could grow more.
