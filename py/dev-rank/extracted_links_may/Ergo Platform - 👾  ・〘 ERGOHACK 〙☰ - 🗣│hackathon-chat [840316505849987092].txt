**Hackerthon**

 https://ergonaut.space/en/Developers

### **Basic**

- Tools for NFTs
- ErgoScript by example additions
- Visualisation tools for SigmaUSD history

### **Intermediate**

- Improvements to ErgoScript (not all the ErgoTree features are projected into it)
- Improvements to Ergo AppKit (basic library for constructing transactions and building offchain logic on top of for Java and JVM languages)
- Tokenization schemes
- Applications for data notarization and names registration
- Applications on top of mixer API
- Ergo Crowdfunding apps/UI
- Improvements to Ergo Node Interface and - Ergo Headless dApp Framework (basic library for constructing transactions and building offchain logic with Rust)

### **Advanced**

- Stealth addresses pool implementation
- More data connectors for the oracle pools
- Private swaps with other chains on Schnorr signature (Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin (?), Komodo (?))
- Visual tool for constructing multi-signatures (could be a good first step for visual tools to construct more complex scripts)


Please add any additional ideas. Everyone participating will be rewarded for delivering anything making any progress towards the current state

We also need mentors to guide the newbs, let us know either in here or DM if you'd be interested.

Happy to guide some new people - I've had experience tutoring various languages to novices and I have some bits on github for getting the testnet node online and interacting with it

@HazeyOneKenobi Ergo testnet node ?


[05/09/2021 10:09 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
Yeah, just a private one in self mining mode. Run it on my laptop whilst I develop so I can send calls in and test


[05/09/2021 10:40 PM] kushti#0978
oh wow


[05/09/2021 10:40 PM] kushti#0978
where's the tutorial ?


[05/09/2021 10:55 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
Just in the ERGnomes repo at the moment. It's quite similar to what's in the bootstrap kit, and all the info was on the wiki pages.
It would be better to just implant a self mining mode into the bootstrap kit, I think

Hey all - for the hackathon, I'm looking to pair with a strong dapp developer with fullstack javascript/typescript experience.  I'm a fullstack developer and designer, but I lean heavily frontend, so I'm looking for someone with skills to complement that. Here's the stack I hope to use:
* NextJS, which is built on React. We would probably host on Vercel.
* GraphQL, hosted on Hasura and backed by PostGreSQL. (we might use a higher level solution like nhost.io)
* NodeJS (though we may be able to cover our bases with Next's backend capabilities)

I would work on the UI/UX design in figma, and code the frontend/apis w/ NextJS/GraphQL/Hasura.  My partner would code the backend in NodeJS and whatever other languages are needed. (I know nothing about programming dapps). You can see my portfolio linked above. 

The idea is a crowdfunding app that could possibly integrate off chain data into a smart contract. We probably need a non-technical person that would be able to research the non-technical parts (e.g., legal, logistics, operations). DM if interested!

Hi guys, i don't have any coding experience, but was wondering if it would be cool to build an onchain metrics website. I'm quite interested in the number of addresses, avg. holdings, and in due time also with the flows of coins etc. Would this be hard to code?

A lot of it should be available through the API I think - https://api.ergoplatform.com/api/v1/docs/

But yes more granular visual tools like that are always welcome. You can play about with a (buggy) demo here

the datastudio link is fairly basic, but the look into bitcoin stuff is rreally telling for on chain analyses/TA


[05/20/2021 8:51 PM] Platypus#2410
you see older coins moving, number of addresses with certain amount of coins


[05/20/2021 8:52 PM] Platypus#2410
which can be interpreted as momentum/strength of moves

Excuse me guys, how can I join a team for the hackathon?


[06/04/2021 6:51 PM] glasgowm#9381
I've added you to the `Hackathon - Participants` role, not sure how teams, etc will work yet.

Thanks I’ll check it out soon


[06/04/2021 6:57 PM] Reed#7093
So I am a basic full stack JavaScript web dev. Is there anything that I could do for Ergo?


[06/04/2021 7:01 PM] glasgowm#9381
Of course, think a lot of the dApps front-end stuff is JS

[06/04/2021 7:03 PM] Reed#7093
Thanks! Is Rust the most used language for Ergo?


[06/04/2021 7:05 PM] glasgowm#9381
This uses Rust, think everything else is scala/ergoscript/js

I see, well Ill set my goals low for now and try extend the documentation. 🙂 Anyone have plans for streaming their development?


[06/04/2021 7:08 PM] glasgowm#9381
That would be a big help thanks! Not heard of anyone streaming yet but sounds like a good shout


[06/04/2021 7:50 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
Streaming development would be great, im going to participate in the event but I'm only starting SCALA now so I can't actually help with anything 😅 I want to try learn as much as possible from the weekend though!

Hey folks. My programming knowledge is very limited but I have bootstraps ready. I am pretty good at reverse engineering software, so am a big fan of open source. 

I want to help create a better system for smart contract pools in Ergo to try to address the smart contract collatoralization issues with the hopes to be able to refork non outsourcability to improve decentralization. 

Long term I want to help improve the open source mining software, and have some fun oracle and NTF ideas too. 🙂


[06/04/2021 11:47 PM] Tolstojevski#7462
@WilfordGrimley  Welcome 🙂 pretty new to ergo myself, but I've been programming for quite a while ('bout 18 years now 🙂 ), so if you get snagged up with programming feel free to drop me a DM, I'll try to help


[06/04/2021 11:57 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Awesome thank you!

Do you already have any projects you are working on for Ergo/ any plans for the Hackathon?


[06/05/2021 12:00 AM] Tolstojevski#7462
@WilfordGrimley  I'm planning on providing a video series working up to a simple wallet viewer in c#, from generating and derivating keys and addresses to, if I manage, firing off a simple transaction maybe 🙂 it will be very newbie friendly on the programming side so hopefully you will find it useful 🙂

Is it possible to display IPFS (HTML) content in an ordinary browser ?


[06/07/2021 6:23 AM] gnuion#3794
Yes, actually you run IPFS daemon as a service in the background and then you can leverage the power of IPFS using any browser. Either way, we are moving towards web3 and browsers that support that technology natively such as Brave.


[06/07/2021 10:02 AM] ziggomatic#9335
there're quite a few public ipfs gateways that don't require those steps

I've started moving people into Teams as you'll see in the user list. Let me know if you want a different group name/colour and if anyone is missing from your groups. 

Anyone who's in @Hackathon - Spare should post in #🤝│i-need-a-team with any ideas on what you'd like to do or skillset. A schedule and more details will be posted shortly - but I figure no reason to delay team organising. Don't worry if you've not got much experience. We can propose something simple or put you in a team suited closer to the time. 

Added #📌│resources - let me know of any other tweaks to Discord (extra channels, roles, etc) that would help.

A lottery on top of Ergo
Is it possible to create a random number generator oracle and use this to supply the random number to select the winner? We just need some number to mod by n-1.

Yes for now I don’t mind losing trust to simplify this, thank you!


[06/11/2021 2:50 PM] nitram147#5106
Why you just don't do a script which will calculate random number based on future block hash. For example, currently is block number 100. Smartcontract will take as entropy source hash of the block 110. You will make smartcontract which you will be able to spend in blocks range 111-120, and based on the block where will be transaction included, you will calculate index of block 110 hash in the current transaction context (which should contain block hashes of the latest 10 blocks).


[06/11/2021 2:51 PM] nitram147#5106
Then you can derive random number in any range by simple modular dividing this entropy


[06/11/2021 2:52 PM] nitram147#5106
However be aware about the modular bias in case that (2^256)%(yourmax) != 0


[06/11/2021 2:53 PM] nitram147#5106
And another protection will be that the smartcontract protected box should be mined before the block 110, otherwise it would fail (players would be able to equaly redeem the money and cancel the bet)


[06/11/2021 2:56 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
How does ERGO allow for multiple addresses for a single public/private key pair if the address is based off a hash of the public key? Or is it different to bitcoins model.


[06/11/2021 3:00 PM] nitram147#5106
Ergo addresses are P2PK - they are the public key. Bitcoin legacy addresses are P2PKH - they are the hash of the public key.

This sounds like a good solution, whenever using blocks for random numbers I assume people can calculate the randomness

[06/11/2021 3:27 PM] quokka#1273
If the script is open source they could use it to somehow get the block hash and calculate the random number before the contract executes


[06/11/2021 3:32 PM] nitram147#5106
Nope, you would construct a box protected by smartcontract call the script AB, when there is only 100 blocks for example. In that script you will write a function which will determine in which block the box was mined


[06/11/2021 3:34 PM] nitram147#5106
If it was mined in target block 111 or later, it's not valid, since everyone knows the value for block 110, so your script left people with option to send back funds.


[06/11/2021 3:34 PM] nitram147#5106
In case the box was mined before the target block 110, it means that the players couldn't know the hashvalue of the upcomming block.


[06/11/2021 3:34 PM] nitram147#5106
They will then have time to call the smartcontract AB (by spending the box) and let it be mined in blocks 111-120 (because if the transaction will be mined in these blocks, it would have access to the latest 10 blocks hashes).


[06/11/2021 3:36 PM] nitram147#5106
Smartcontract AB will also restrict it's loterry function if the box would be spent later than in block 120, because it cannot longer access the entropy which was defined as hash of block 110.


[06/11/2021 3:36 PM] nitram147#5106
Is it clear to you know? 🙂


[06/11/2021 3:39 PM] nitram147#5106
The hash of the block 110, would be dependend on the transactions which were mined and also all the block metadata + PoW solution. So it would be random. There's only one way of cheating - 100% of miners will drop all the bock candicates which doesn't have the "specific" hash they want it to be - but it would need cooperated miners attack. It wouldn't be worth it 🙂

Block number (aka HEIGHT) is an approximation of time. First block was created on 14:02:5701.07.2019, then ideally (2 minutes between blocks) * (last block height) gives us the `computed` blockchain time. How it is different from the `actual` time? Whether this difference is growing? The graph can show the difference for each epoch (i.e. 1024) blocks. 
We can know how accurate our blockchain clock is.

First Ergo Hackathon
We are thinking about organizing a hackathon, likely in May. The topic would be " Completing the Basics ", so improving basic infrastructure needed for building the DApps, (also, to profit from them)  The following topics are proposed:   Improvements to ErgoScript (not all the ErgoTree features are projected into it) Improvements to Ergo AppKit ...

Crowdfunding daughter pools, and saturation bounties leading to automated crowdfunding and daughter pool creation are the core solution that can make non-outsourcability appealing to small miners in my view.

Everyone in the team is trying to learn as much as we can right now. ErgoScript is our biggest hurdle.

The best solution between L3 and L2 are is likely includes miner with an authentication key provided from the pool's authentication contract, pools providing shares to miners, such that the pools can gather information about realtime hashrates, to better calculate rewards.


[06/11/2021 11:40 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Not the full papers, I'll go dig.


[06/11/2021 11:44 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Could a full node miner acting honestly be trusted to provide it's real time hashing power to an Ergo Oracle? (edit: It seems that P2Pool answers this question. Technically yes)


[06/11/2021 11:44 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
And would the existence of such a thing allow Ergo to descend to context 4 for smart contract complexity?

@kushti I assume that the testnet mining autolykosv2 parameters are the same as the mainnet autolykosv2 parameters. Unfortunately I don't have a GPU with more tham 2GB VRAM so I'm not able to mine at the testnet. And because nobody is doing so https://testnet.ergoplatform.com/en/ , we would be not able to test our hackathon output on the testnet once it will be testnet test ready. Is there a way how can I mine on testnet with lower GPU VRAM?

There are two ways you can do this connect miner to @kushti node (http://213.239.193.208:9052) or setup a node on testnet network and connect miner to it.

Can you provide more details? Which API?


[06/12/2021 5:33 PM] scalahub#2618
yes it appears to be a typo. In ErgoScript, both def and val are supported but the syntax is slightly different. I believe def is just a wrapper on val
The correct syntax is 
```
{
  val isFriend = { (inputBox: Box) => inputBox.id == SELF.id}
  INPUTS.exists (isFriend)
}```

The equivalent def one is

```
{
  def isFriend(inputBox: Box) = inputBox.id == SELF.id
  INPUTS.exists (isFriend)
}```
You can quickly verify code here

Is there any reason why do you defaultly send 0.1ERG with NFT? (reason why the 0.1ERG amount and not for example 0.01). Same question is about the hardcoded fee in follow request for ergo-assembler - why there is 4000000nanoERG fee for transaction return? 🙂 @anon_real


[06/13/2021 2:43 PM] nitram147#5106
0.1ERG should be enough for 100 transactions if I'm right (based on the fees right know and the fact that miners are happy to mine anything at the moment)


[06/13/2021 2:47 PM] anon_real#2768
Where do you mean exactly for 0.1 ERG amount? You mean the default first bid of auction?


[06/13/2021 2:47 PM] nitram147#5106
Nope, when you select to mint a NFT in ergoutils


[06/13/2021 2:48 PM] anon_real#2768
For the assembler, higher fees mean in case of failure, user request will be mined fast and better UX. Considering that assembler txs are bigger than usual, 0.004 ERG is not much.


[06/13/2021 2:49 PM] anon_real#2768
No particular reason, just a default )
User is probably sending NFT to himself or the auction house. If he is sending to himself, the default value doesn't matter because he'll receive it. In case of auction house, user will have to change the default value anyway based on the initial bid amount.


[06/13/2021 2:52 PM] nitram147#5106
Thanks. Is there some "formula" (equation) you would recomment me to calcuate good enough fees to follow request to ergo-assembler (both for minting & also for refund transaction). By equation I mean like how to calculate from the amount of inputs and outputs based on their "average" byte size, how much erg fee should I pay 🙂


[06/13/2021 2:55 PM] anon_real#2768
A fee estimation endpoint was supposed to be added to the node API, not sure if it is added. But you can see transactions in the explorer and see the `Fee per Byte` value to see what is the current trend.

[06/13/2021 4:50 PM] anon_real#2768
@nitram147 It's not possible to skip registers. You should use them in order.


[06/13/2021 4:53 PM] anon_real#2768
If you mean in a single transaction, it is not possible with current wallets.
You can use airdrop tool of ergoutils.org

[06/13/2021 6:22 PM] nitram147#5106
How was it then possible that it worked without it by for example specifiyng "name":"token-name" instead of direct specification of R4 ? 🙂

In eip4 it is explained that R4 through R6 are used with name, description and decimal!


[06/13/2021 6:46 PM] Ilya | Spectrum#0494
In order to get boxes with the desired R8 and then filter those, which issue an NFT


[06/13/2021 6:46 PM] anon_real#2768
So in other words, you can't set R4 through R6 when issuing tokens.

@nitram147 Your request is wrong. `ergValue` is only defined for outputs that are issuing tokens.


[06/13/2021 6:53 PM] anon_real#2768
For ordinary outputs (ones that are not issuing tokens), `value` must be used.


[06/13/2021 6:56 PM] nitram147#5106
It work like a charm now 🤩  Is it mentioned somewhere? I'm sure that I did today and even yesterday went through all of the available documentation... Sorry for spamming it there. I literally wasted like 2 hours right now with this stupid bug 😦


[06/13/2021 6:58 PM] anon_real#2768
Good to hear that. Assembler uses node request standard, no new concepts are added to assembler other than things like `$userIns` that are explained in the doc.


[06/13/2021 6:58 PM] anon_real#2768
Maybe you should see node request examples in the swagger.


[06/13/2021 7:00 PM] nitram147#5106
I was playing with swagger before, however it lacks many examples, there's always only one example per api end point (at least in my version), so I did not bumped into complete exhausting node api documentation where would I read all the required details 🙂


[06/13/2021 7:01 PM] anon_real#2768
Yes, the community can use better docs for sure. I believe it had also some grants if someone does things like that )


[06/13/2021 7:02 PM] nitram147#5106
I would like to help with making documentation once I find a time, becuase Ergo has so many great tools, however when they lack documentation and people had to try to guess, or trial-error brute force parameters, or reverse engineer codes from github, it's definitely not a great experience 🙂

[06/13/2021 8:14 PM] kushti#0978
@nitram147 /nipopow/proof/{minChainLength}/{suffixLength}/{headerId} to get nipopow proof for a block header with id headerId (6 and 6 would be enough for minChainLength & suffixLength I guess), and /blocks/{headerId}/proofFor/{txId} for proof of transaction against the header  + minting transaction

A lot of good came out of the research we did for smart pools. 

All of us in Team Smart Pools came out of the weekend having learned a bunch. Our thirst is unquenched, and I am confident that all of us will continue to research and attempt to created functional solutions in the future.

While our actual submission included no code and thus didn't prove the capabilities of our goals, it presented the problem of centralization that Ergo faces, and will provide future researchers, and programmers with a basis in their potential solutions. 

If what is proposed proves to be impossible, it will at least provide all of us a simple lens to view the problem from a perspective of realistic possibilities.

Glad to hear that you guys are still encouraged to delve deeper though.  Hackathons/jams/etc are always great for these things.


[06/15/2021 6:26 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
We want to build a system using existing tools that enables collateralized smart contract mining pools to function on Ergo that are compatible with both outsourecable and non-outsourceable PoW to encourage the greatest decentralization. The system should enable ‘everyday people’ to be in profit. Previously collateralized smart contracts on Ergo proved not to be worthwhile for those with small hashpower.

If this solution is ultimately successful in providing proof, it could lead to the creation of Autolykos v3, including most of the benefits of autolykos v2 but with non-outsourceability reenabled.


[06/15/2021 6:28 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
What was submitted to meet deadline is missing citation and has many errors. I am working hard to create a more public facing paper eligible for publication. Currently I hope for it to meet the eligibility criteria for eprint and to get an initial compatible version ready for the 21st.

I don't fully understand what smart contracts are, they're dapps I guess based on some quick researching.  But you said to further decentralize stuff which is good 😛 lol


[06/15/2021 7:08 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Smart contracts are essentially conditions that when met do something. They are backed by programming and the security of the  blockchain that runs them. The more secure/decentralized the chain is, the more confident participants in a smart contract can be that it is acting honestly.

[06/18/2021 3:12 AM] arokace#8057
Pretty sure its the gold standard for that shit.  You can put in as complicated of an equation you can think of and it should be able to give you an answer.  From derivatives to 1+1 to graphs.

Can the community expect the Hackathon announcement today? Is it coming this week?

It would for nice for a communication that it was delayed. ☺️

Overall this has been a very pleasant event. I am looking forward to the next one.

We as the SigmaStamp team ( @nitram147  @Pavol Hejný ) would like to thank's for the chance to be able to participate in the hackathon 🙂
To be honest, I (pavol did not seen the hackathon results yet) was really surprised that we got the 2nd place even when pavol (frontend part) didn't completed whole frontend (he joined only on sunday) thank's to the lack of time. I really appreciate the prize and the judges decision - it really surprised me in a good way ❤️ 🤩

Here's the killer ergo app: a rideshare app w/ no middleman.
* 100% of profits go to the driver (vs the crazy service fee charged by uber/lyft)
* could incorporate offchain data to verify that user has been delivered to destination GPS coordinate
* could build a decentralized review/rating system
* could on-ramp drivers that already have established Uber/Lyft profiles and potentially import that data to kickstart the review/rating system
* rider’s feel great because they’re directly paying their drivers, and the overall fare is less than that of uber/lyft
* driver’s feel great b/c they get paid more/their fair share

* alternatively: 90% of profit could go to drivers, 10% to a driver's cooperative. the driver's can then vote on what to do with the accrued funds at the end of every year

Hii everyone


[09/10/2021 6:48 PM] nosynq#1900
Hi there! I just want to bring an idea for hackathon. Or maybe for private dev who may be interested in it. Imagine a smart-contract that will reveal a secret string to the first owner of NFT with certain value. For example if I buy NFT for 100usd (above threshold preset in smart contract) I will additionally receive kinda token with a secret string in it. I’m not a dev, sorry. Is it possible?

[10/03/2021 6:59 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Hello all. Last Hackathon my team submitted SmartPools, an early decentralized mining solution. 

This time my team will be aiming to produce an on chain music streaming/ library platform where artists can share  their audio NFTs, while (ideally) remaining in possession of the NFTs, and listeners can donate to the artists if they so choose, while building their own music library. 

The project is inspired by FunkWhale, an open source federated music streaming platform for Creative Commons licensed music. 

For the Hackathon I aim to produce a whitepaper and ideally function smart contracts (this should be relatively easy, as the auction house contracts can be adapted). 

In the future, light clients can be constructed that allow listeners to download their library from blockchain. 

It would be lovely to merge my team with any others, or have others join my team. 😃

@glasgowm can I please get an ErgoAudio team channel 😉

@ERGOHACK II Participants we're into our last week of team building before ERGOHACK II begins. 

Check out the seed projects in the `━━ TEAMS | ERGOHACK ━━` section and either indicate your interest in that topic or take it on yourself to recruit others from the #🤝│i-need-a-team section.

#ergolend is the only formed team at the moment. @ErgoLend is your team complete now?

@WilfordGrimley is looking for people to join him in #ergo-audio 

These channels are just idea projects - let me know if anyone needs a custom channel added!

You can’t have a ride share app where 100% of profits go to driver.  No one will build or maintain the software.

Now a rideshare app where 97% of profits go to drive may be sustainable.  The major hurdle seems to be an identity verification and validation mechanism.  There has to be trust that the driver has the rep they claim to have and the passenger does as well

Interview with Alex Chepurnoy - part 1/3

Part 1 of the extensive interview with Ergo co-founder and core developer Alex Chepurnoy, known as Kushti. Asking the questions is Root7Z. Many interesting topics are covered in part 1, including:

Kushti's Background (00:07)

Kushti's goals in the blockchain space (4:46).

why he decided to stop working with his previous projects and create Ergo (10:53).

What would he have done differently if he could turn back time and start Ergo again from day 1 (14:56).

The Ergo Manifesto, and how Kushti sees the rest of the crypto space at this point in time (16:57).

Kushti's recollections of Bitcoin's early history before and after Nakamoto (21:09).

Why Kushti chose UTXO for Ergo (23:28).

The pros and cons of UTXO vs the account model (27:57). 

+ + + + + 

Please note that we have endeavoured to provide accurate subtitles for this interview, translated into many major languages.

@Frosty when is the deadline to showcase our dapp? and how much time do we have to present our dapp?


[10/09/2021 2:22 PM] Thales#6915
do we have some kind of an agenda?

Here's where I've gotten so far on my Metaverg NFT collections explorer.  Mostly setup so far:
- ExpressJS server using the explorer-backend/chain-grabber postgres database
- ReactJS client

Is ergo delivery idea still up?


[10/09/2021 4:08 PM] weskinner#4666
something of interest, the first NFT was "Kushti's Test Token" I assume created by @kushti in this Transaction https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/f04dd00b1cb28cb85967eec78c65a3c5f83e3b334c2aac22a61b1a72dbae239a

Might be worth something one day 🙂

Who has this lol


[10/09/2021 5:38 PM] Marty#4039
The only thing with this approach is that you don't have any control over tokenomics and can't mint more. Eventually people will design some smart contracts on ergoscript that allow token creators a lot more control over the process.

can you extend match deadline for one more day?

Do you need any help with reduced transaction implementation in sigma-rust?


[10/10/2021 5:22 AM] minotaur#0852
@greenhat Im writing serialize transaction and verify implementation by appkit. the only diff is cost.
you can see on https://github.com/minotaur-ergo/sigma-rust
but this implementation takes too many times from us. because Im not rust developer.
I have to implement load transaction from serialized byte and ... .
these implementation takes too many times and we can not implement our wallet. 
only time against us.

I'm looking into it.


[10/10/2021 6:05 AM] greenhat#6562
I'm not sure I get that right. Costing is a huge task and probably will take weeks to implement. I suggest going with cost=0. With this in mind, I think I can implement ReducedTransaction with serialization and parsing in a few hours. I'll take your code and build on top of it in a separate PR.


[10/10/2021 6:09 AM] minotaur#0852
yes you right. cost=0 is fastest. 
thanks for implementing reduced transaction parsing

Asking for clarity on late submissions but I don't think it'll be an issue and just considered in the judging process so nobody has an advantage. Please let us know by deadline if you plan to submit a bit late though. Thanks!

While recommended, I don't think the topic is a requirement. @root7Z can maybe confirm

it could be i guess, ergodex devs were also developing analytics applications. It's better if you develop the idea around privacy and security topics but you are welcomed to participate

I missed this space but listened to recording. Earlier yesterday I attended space by Chris Ray. I am currently working on privacy preserving machine learning on Cardano+SingulariyNet. I think I can make this work on Ergo also. I am exploring if a smart contract designed for cardano (eUTXO model) can be easily migrated to Ergo. I am excited by some of the privacy features in Ergo. I dont have too much indepth knowledge of Ergo. I dont think I have enough time for the hackathon, however while i am building on Cardano, I will ensure that it can be easily ported to Ergo also. The first step in that is getting the Ergo node up for development. I went through the documentation and I think I should have it up and running quickly. Irrespective of the hackathon I am planning to keep making some progress (ofcourse my first deliverables will be on Cardano) .. I will seek guidance and assistance from this community as i keep making progress. Thanks for these spaces

Hello !
I really don't feel ready for this ErgoHack 
My programming skill is still basic,
Haven't built something for  year, But feeling kind of ready for some (kind of lite) challenges...


[01/29/2022 10:01 PM] Ody Boja#0609
would love to be helpful to a team for this ErgoHack ...


[01/29/2022 10:08 PM] Ody Boja#0609

Hi there, we are trying to sign and send a tx with Yoroi, however, the connector does not return any message, is there a way to find out what is causing the trouble? Or do we need to fiddle around until we get it right??


[02/12/2022 12:13 AM] glasgowm#9381
Probably easier using #💳・nautilus


[02/12/2022 12:13 AM] Thales#6915

Nautiluses is far superior to yoroi, highly encourage you to integrate


[02/12/2022 12:29 AM] Thales#6915
Yes we will discuss this first thing in the morning, thanks!

Hi,
There are some general methods here:
https://github.com/anon-real/ErgoAuctionHouse/blob/master/src/auction/yoroiUtils.js
The auction house is using them and they should work fine.

Are you trying to sign a tx with P2S inputs or you are just trying to send some funds?


[02/12/2022 4:47 AM] abchris#8522
Hey Captain, taking on your offer. We're still far away from wallet integration but if there's an example out there of what that involves, that'd be great. Just trying to wrap my head around it.


[02/12/2022 7:22 AM] anon_real#2768
You can take a look at what the auction house is doing. Nautilus integration is the same as Yoroi's.

Sure thing, will produce some documentation today if time permits, but for now you can take a look at Yoroi's (api is exactly the same) example code: https://github.com/Emurgo/yoroi-frontend/tree/develop/packages/yoroi-ergo-connector/example-ergo

EIP-12: https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/pull/23/files#diff-cb3f835ea389f22c2f074a6acd820d178e44c82df8898e8ff36aea7f762b6710

Specifically with Nautilus, to avoid conflicts, you can call `ergoConnector.nautilus.connect()` in place of `window.ergo_request_read_access()` and `ergoConnector.nautilus.isConnected()` in place of `window.ergo_check_read_access()`

Updateable Multisig Pattern
In the light of ErgoHack III going on, I am revising different known contracts regarding privacy.  One of the most unknown things still, unfortunately, is how treasury contract is done. And there are some interesting things here. One of them is updateable threshold scheme, which can be interesting per se.  Treasury contract is done in ErgoTree, ...

Would we hash a contract script and store it in R4 then?

Stored fully in this example, but you can store hash and present contract in an input context extension variable

Hey, it does not matter. It is just a dummy TX ID to convert it to an input box.


[02/13/2022 2:20 AM] anon_real#2768
So it is basically saying that, suppose this box was the output of a transaction with that ID. For testing it should not matter.


[02/13/2022 3:01 AM] kii#8888
Ah that makes sense. This is only for testing purposes

[02/13/2022 7:51 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134

[02/13/2022 7:52 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
delete your 17 and install nvm


[02/13/2022 7:52 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
after it write `nvm install --lts`


[02/13/2022 7:54 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
the problem 100% in nodejs


[02/13/2022 7:54 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
I will go sleep, if you have any other problems, tag me


[02/13/2022 7:54 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
🙂


[02/13/2022 8:00 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i did what you said but im getting the same problem - after installing lts with nvm, i remove node modules folder and again run npm i, and then npm start


[02/13/2022 8:00 PM] liquid_phase#4605
and its not working


[02/13/2022 8:01 PM] liquid_phase#4605
node -v output says 16.14


[02/13/2022 8:20 PM] daskre#4439
fwiw I just tried it with my old local 14.18.1 and it looks fine. Maybe something stupid like browser caching or smth?


[02/13/2022 8:24 PM] liquid_phase#4605
to be clear, you all pulled the 'Edge' branch from github, right?


[02/13/2022 8:26 PM] liquid_phase#4605
because there is a main, and dev branch, and both of those have a presently working UI without router in the code


[02/13/2022 8:32 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
Oh.


[02/13/2022 8:32 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
No, I use main branch


[02/13/2022 8:32 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
Ok, check on the edge


[02/13/2022 8:35 PM] liquid_phase#4605
ty so much for the help @Dmitry Usov


[02/13/2022 8:36 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
yes it is not working


[02/13/2022 8:39 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
okay man


[02/13/2022 8:39 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
I found the bug


[02/13/2022 8:39 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
it is on sidebar.js


[02/13/2022 8:40 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
I forgot how this bug names


[02/13/2022 8:41 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
like 'cyclical link'


[02/13/2022 8:41 PM] liquid_phase#4605
ohhh


[02/13/2022 8:41 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i see what i did


[02/13/2022 8:42 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i put main inside of main


[02/13/2022 8:42 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
You at the Main component use leftsidebar

Is that going to be happening this one too? Or since it s way longer u guys will only worry about the final submission

Swamp.audio development / project update:
```
Updates:
•Website being built out - stack is complete and robust, 
•Frontend components are being designed and relational data applied on the backend for Albums & single tracks.
•Podcast feed and functionality works, have first few guests agreed to episodes regarding the value they put into their craft and their exploration into the crypto space as an artist.

Work in progress:
•Drawing out models and discussing their viability with team for best methodology for minting of asset-pack or singular object media to be used in larger products (a single track can be released by an artist on their own album as well as to a label's album, it's up to the artist - so designing a best practice for this to mitigate continuous re-minting of NFT objects.
•Current idea is to utilize json/yaml data and tie it to ergoscript as both are fairly boolean - to make the layer two more about organization and management of existing assets on the blockchain - potentially mint markdown file itself to blockchain as immutable record of the art as it moves through crypto space being used in various larger projects, larger projects can be minted as markdown files containing arrays and relationships of NFT identifiers

Haven't started:
•Will integrate Ergo payment/connector functionality into site once the basic infrastructure behind  media management is complete, as one can not purchase media without proper routes and file permissions and such.
•Hopes are to integrate ergofund/raffle at the same time as the payment processing and then subsequently build out the user system for existing artists under the roster (will open to general public once thorough testing and multi-tenancy has been completed.

I’ll be honest I was building a dex/nft market aggregator for eth/evm cross chain when I stumbled onto ergos utility from watching armeanio interview on Ryan matta YouTube

There are public nodes out there that can be used on both mainnet and testnet.


[05/11/2022 6:32 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Though learning how to run your own node can be useful when building a dApp


[05/11/2022 6:34 AM] TheSentientNFT#0744
yea I ran a eth node for a while, i'll definitely get it set up for ergo once I get my head around the ecosystem more. Still eating through the documentation

[05/11/2022 7:05 AM] NoahErgo#4349
Yeah i feel that definitely. Theres a lot of value there though and would be a good way to create accessibility to erg ofrom other ecosystems. Get erg off of its island

I agree with Marty, nautilus is awesome! It instantly finds all my assets. Yoroi was just so slow. So far I know of only two defi tools on Ergo, and these are ageUSD and ErgoDEX. I sometimes buy sigUSD to leverage my position on ERG. Looking forward to something like aave for ERG. 😁


[05/11/2022 9:48 PM] Ulmo#5367
Ergo Nation update: Working on crawling data from explorer API using R (thanks to @curbsideprophet for the tooling). We can now generate a table of ID addresses and their activity. We are still looking for front end dev to make a website, where that table and information is published. Also looking for more game ideas and developers.

[05/12/2022 6:13 PM] TheSentientNFT#0744
This is really solid flow 💯 you can also have groups of musicians submit stems


[05/12/2022 6:14 PM] TheSentientNFT#0744
Then you can have people make songs with the stems and have a ui that transposes it so it’s all in the right key


[05/12/2022 6:27 PM] liquid_phase#4605
thank you 🙂 i believe that this is a very simple framework which enables a form of collaboration in he NfT space . That is a very interesting idea to enact javascript or server level transposition and web based collaboration! I wonder how far this concept can be taken 🙂


[05/12/2022 6:33 PM] TheSentientNFT#0744
theres a lot of cool music stuff on github. Cornell has a music ai you can train and make music with


[05/12/2022 6:34 PM] TheSentientNFT#0744

Hello teams! How is your first week of the hackathon going? 

SHORT UPDATES. As you already know, our hackathon will run for three weeks:
the first week is to discuss ideas and the next two weeks to develop a prototype.

At the end of each week, you will be asked to fill out interim reports. This is highly important to capture your sprint achievements and will help our judges in making the right decision. 

Fill in your first week results here https://q9fwzopidh8.typeform.com/to/WR2IOaP1

We encourage Team Leads to fill out the form for simplicity. However, if individual team members also want to participate, feel free!

All the reports have to be filled out by Sunday noon (12PM UTC) 

We wish you good luck!

[05/15/2022 3:05 PM] liquid_phase#4605
hey Ilya thanks!

As someone who is just starting on integrating the node into their server, where is a good starting point? I assume it's the appkit and then using the java/json way


[05/15/2022 3:24 PM] ilya | dappstep#9261
Hey, I’m using javascript/nodejs 😅. At that point rely on a public node only. 

As a lean approach i would suggest you start with a public node to get your dApp up and running quickly (especially during the hackathon) and move to your own node once your project is ready to use/validated


[05/15/2022 3:27 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Installing a node on my own system and working to integrate it can only provide me the correct methodology for working with a public node, and give me the added benefit of an opportunity to properly integrate it the first try


[05/15/2022 3:27 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i will try it and see 🙂 thanks for the tip


[05/15/2022 3:56 PM] ilya | dappstep#9261
You will learn a few things from running your own node for sure!


[05/15/2022 4:03 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i have run one on my desktop computer - so far  I have learned is that Mac M1/monterey OS needs a beta version or the jar to sync properly, lol


[05/15/2022 4:03 PM] liquid_phase#4605
elsewise the rest of the interface between swagger and the panel seems quite understandable.. and then how well the node itself responds to a multitude of get requests from the front end if the site has alot of use.. etc - thinking it might need a 'mempool' type of thing on the layer two to time the node access


[05/15/2022 4:04 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i think the biggest concern i have about the server node is less about complexity and more about scalability and server resources, as a node even for ergo being small is still rather large to host in the cloud

I’m aiming to develop the Simple Coliving Smart Contract over the next two weeks.

I have only developed four web apps before.  Three on Ruby on Rails and one on ReactJS. So I’m learning ergoscript for the first time. If there are any more experienced developers who would like to help make this prototype then your support would be really appreciated!

[05/30/2022 12:51 PM] TheSentientNFT#0744
and with apple blocking poe games

i think you are referring to this website: https://ergo.nodespyder.io/
here is the github repo: https://github.com/chriswill/ergonode-spyder

the website is no longer active though but since the repo is public someone can definitely get it up and running again! 

edit: although i don't think it was in the last hackathon

Oh yeah how finished is necessary for the Hackathon? Just a Proof of Concept or like a working test on Testnet.

Also does it have to be an original idea specifically for the Hackathon or naw, cause I have a few projects I’ve dabbled in for a month or so


[09/14/2022 7:42 PM] Reignblood#0843
Something I think would be useful would be a crypto powered auction house. I’m not sure if that’s a feasible thing and I’m fairly new to crypto only been mining a few months.

First off, want to say thank you for nurturing a great community and holding the ErgoHacks that motivate many people around the world to build on Ergo.

With that being said, I think there are some improvements that could be made to the ErgoHack process to ensure fairness and to streamline the judging process to be as transparent as possible. 

There was improvement in this area this time around by releasing the judges on the panel but there is still no clear criteria on what is judged. In this last ErgoHack, it seemed pretty arbitrary on the selection process as some of the winners did not submit any code and only provided a short description of what they wanted to do.

Nothing wrong with this and nothing against the teams, but there were many other teams that provided a lot more concrete work and details into their implementation. Yes, I say this from our own perspective, representing Night Owl, but also many other teams that submitted  with a great deal of explanation, code, insight, plans, etc.

One of the possible solutions is to create a simple criteria table listing 5-8 different judging points. These points can have a description mentioning what they will judge on and should be released to the community. Then each judge can go through each row, giving a score of 1-10. Then the teams with the highest points win.

Again, love this community and the teams building on it, so it’s nothing personal. Just felt it was the right thing to do for me to address. Much love to you all 💜```

Please someone develop a simple add on or integrated method to solo-mine to my own node.  Kaspa has mining integrated into the node such that I don't need any third party programs to mine directly to.


[09/23/2022 4:41 AM] Babelfish24#2887
This also increases decentralization as it makes it easier for individuals to help provide network security.


[09/23/2022 5:40 AM] carllittle1#3740
You already can. You just tell your miner to mine your IP instead of a pool


[09/23/2022 5:41 AM] Babelfish24#2887
just a bare node?


[09/23/2022 5:41 AM] Babelfish24#2887
Do you have an example?  I thought you needed a stratum server?


[09/23/2022 5:44 AM] carllittle1#3740
ERG was at one point only minable to your own node.  There was really good documentation for it. I'll see if I can dig it up and get back to you. Might be tomorrow sometime as it's pretty late here.


[09/23/2022 5:45 AM] Babelfish24#2887
That would be great, but everything I have seen you need either Miningocre, Ergostratum server, or Ergonomp.


[09/23/2022 5:46 AM] Babelfish24#2887
on a separate note, do you know how to reinitialize my node wallet, I want to tie a different wallet to the node than the one I used...


[09/23/2022 7:59 AM] Balb#7267
In the directory where you run the node there is a .ergo directory. Delete the wallet directory inside the .ergo directory

I had an idea for Autolykos 1 rules sidechain with hashrate limit that mints NFT or used for project launch maybe. Or may can be combined with FIMO for extremely fair initial distribution.

Maybe the chains could be temporary, you could spin chains up and down on demand. Set the initial parameters & the chain runs until the mint or ICO is over.  Maybe over a period of 3 days-2 months you release some percent of your supply.


[09/28/2022 11:27 PM] tripple_threatt27#0430
Thank you for the feedback & consideration


[09/28/2022 11:34 PM] tripple_threatt27#0430
If it is possible the alternative mining environment would not compete with the main chain as you can only put a limited amount of hashrate on the sidechain. You could maybe even have one card/CPU mine that chain & the rest mining erg. Almost like spec mining. The alternative environment could also protect projects from whales dumping early.

@ERGOHACKV Participants :kushtii: ! Welcome to our fifth anniversary hackathon co-presented with Flux, Alephium and the Djed Alliance. 

Over the following two weeks, you'll build your applications and provide solutions. Today you will be offered a series of videos from our teams. 

After this, participants are free to chat in #🗣│hackathon-chat  , find team members in #🤝│i-need-a-team  (or participate solo)

After you've got an idea, tag @glasgowm  with your team name, and he can set up a dedicated channel where you can communicate with each other or request help from our mentors.

At the end of the first week, you will be asked to complete an interim report on the work done, which is highly important for our subsequent judging. 

We wish all of you good luck!

We are kicking things off with a welcome message by Armeanio. Good luck to all participants; we look forward to seeing your hackathon ideas come to life!

[10/03/2022 9:19 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Thanks.

Am I correct in assuming then that when any of the plasma subpools mines a block, they all split the block reward in a PPS model?


[10/03/2022 9:21 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Nah, there is logical separation between the pools. So think of them like virtual pools with their own miners and payouts. Being in one pool means you only get rewards when your pool finds a block.


[10/03/2022 9:21 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
The way you described is also possible though, but requires a few changes


[10/03/2022 9:30 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
It could make voting simpler to have them function that way. i.e. join this subpool to vote yea without suffering less consistent payouts.
(Although I think I prefer the model where a miner is awarded a box from the pool as it could function as a modular layer on any other smartpool solution such as the one that GetBlok has implement at the moment.)

To make the case for favoring subpools splitting block rewards with PPS: If they are reliant on a singular stratum anyway there is no true benefit to decentralization for requiring them to independently earn their own block rewards. It could help to increase the uptake of FIMO and other such smartpool schemes if miners could have the same consistency of payouts regardless of the subpool they join.

[10/04/2022 12:16 AM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Reason being: I am interested in having an ergo full node spun up and bootstrapped by another node on the same network with a particular set of values and when triggered by smart contract, and then later have that node that we spun up taken back down to conserve resources at a particular block height.


[10/04/2022 12:49 AM] WilfordGrimley#0124
I am entertained by the idea of using Flux for this, but it does not seem possible to deploy to flux without interacting with ZelCore. Ideally when atomic swaps and babel feels are introduced, Ergo's smart contracts will be able to spin up Flux containers deterministically using Flux's parallel asset and a dApp on Ergo bridged directly to Flux without requiring interaction with ZelCore (excluding the usage of the parallel asset that is dependent on ZelCore.)

eUTxO.org - Visual Blockchain Explorer for Cardano
What's inside Cardano blocks? The best way to learn new things about eUTxO (Unspent Transaction Output) transactions is to look at them. This is the best blockchain explorer available, with the most intuitive interface.

Whats this one?

CYTI stands for Choose Your Token ID, this is a "minable" smart contrat allowing to mint tokens with a given character sequence at the begining of the token ID.
A token minter create a CITY request, miners tries to generates the proper token ID using the CITY miner software.
When one of the miners succeed, it get the fee from the CYTI contract and the token with the right token ID is sent to the token minter.
Depending on the length of the character sequence requested, the computation is more or less difficult, the miners will be able to set a minimal price for the request for the possible requested length.
For example the following transaction has minted "cccccc" tokens from a CYTI request:

Hi frens, is that possible in ergo env to store data on chain? Didn't find any protocol for that.

Yea, you can put registers on eUTXOs to store data on-chain. Can be any valid ErgoScript data type.

Question regarding network security:

Is having one node with "x"GH/s more secure than having two nodes with "x/2” GH/s etc.?

My suspiscion is that the larger any single honest node the more secure the network is from a double spending attack, but the more vulnerable it is to that node being attacked or acting dishonstly.

Would like to implement a pool/dao that has a lock/fixed period contract where one will ERG, ERG-FLUX, or any ERG/ADA tokens (once spectrum can handle). That pool is taken and used to operate FLUX nodes and get a reasonable yield based on whatever the node is producing. The flux company created a "Titan" node, but it has a low yield in the grand scheme of what one would earn if pooled with friends -- I've wanted to do this since last June, but had no time in Summer/Fall to even focus on it. Also, think of staking in ZIL and possibly ADA... could create a blended yield depending on the way the DAO went. Was hoping to use Paideia as a basis for the DAO, but doesn't appear it is functional completely yet (think Walrus is using it though). Anyway, I'm not a programmer but can layout the map and help get from napkin to a polished product.

[01/28/2023 10:06 PM] networkspore#4282
I'm looking for a team, but also have an idea for a project (as well as an application for it lol). 
It would be my first project with ergo.
I've been working on a platform in react, and would like to make an app for that platform that can communicate directly with a local full node. 

The most direct method I can think of at this point would be to use a file that is written to by both a java applicaiton, and the react app. (in java you would need a randomAccessFile and in JS you would use a fileSystemHandle).  

Basically when the react app wants to send the node a message, it writes to a file, then the java app which is watching that file sees that there is message, reads the message communicates with the node and then responds back to the react app, by writing to the file again. 

On the react side you could use this in a lot of different ways. For example if you wanted to be able to send a transaction from your phone, once the react app would be running and communicating with the node, you could generate keys that would allow you to have a computer synced up to your node at home, and then communicate with your node from wherever, on a light client phone app.

[01/29/2023 7:48 PM] networkspore#4282
how would you access the p2p interface from a browser

(access p2p interface)


[01/29/2023 7:52 PM] networkspore#4282

Random access files are implemented in browsers under the FIle System Access API.  (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API)

[02/05/2023 7:53 PM] networkspore#4282
I thnk a lot of sites wouldn't want to use the file system api because in order to get a file handle you have to prompt the user to select a file. (the handle can then be saved for subsequent visits in the indexedDB)

However, if a site is already using the file system access api, then it fits.

It's also not supported by Firefox 😬

(re  : *<soysor> It's also not supported by Firefox 😬*) 
 
 Good choice. I hate how google is turning chrome into some kind of operating system


[02/06/2023 12:36 AM] networkspore#4282
Firefox is basically a legacy browser at this point. (unfortunately)
If your making something that requires legacy support, then it matters what firefox can do, but at this point it's basically obsolete.


[02/06/2023 12:58 AM] networkspore#4282
For example, async/await is not supported by firefox, and their implementation of async all together is poor.
They also don't seem to be able to properly implement WebGL, so webGL games will lag on it.
If Flash was still a thing, firefox would be ok, but since they aren't keeping up, it doesn't make sense to try and support them.

I'm sorry but you've been blinded by chromium


[02/06/2023 1:11 AM] networkspore#4282
WebGL on firefox is laggy if you want to do anything substantial with it. They are trying to get support for async / await, and have a development browser which implements it, so hopefully they can get their act together at some point.


[02/06/2023 1:14 AM] networkspore#4282
I've done plenty of testing between the two, chrome always wins in every category. I still use firefox because of it's open nature, but it's dying.


[02/06/2023 1:17 AM] networkspore#4282
Frankly whenever I wonder what is lagging out my computer these days it's always firefox. lol

Firefox supports async await since 2016 I am not sure what you are talking about

[02/06/2023 1:30 AM] networkspore#4282
In JavaScript async / await is a way to run asynchronous functions in line. It makes animations an user interface operations much simpler.

Using hooks in react you can run a web woker, (or make a thread) as easy as running a function. It's pretty sweet. Not happening in firefox.


[02/06/2023 1:30 AM] networkspore#4282
If you have plenty of boiler plate code to handle multithreading with ease, and that's your thing, then this doesn't matter, but for simple minded people like me it helps.


[02/06/2023 1:37 AM] Satergo.com#0000
I know what it is and I told you that Firefox supports it since 2016

Also I'm not a js programmer so I do not really care


[02/06/2023 2:07 AM] networkspore#4282
I mean you obviously have ulterior motives to this conversation, or you wouldn't be disagreeing about something you don't know or care about.
MultiThread in Chrome API: 
const variable = await worker.functionToCall()

Non-Multithread Firefox API:

let variable = null;
functionToCall().then((result)=>{
      variable = result;
});

And that's just async if you want that to be multi-threaded there's another page of calls you have to make.

The problem is also that now, variable is not in it's original scope, so if you wanted to make a user interaction happen, you would have lost your context.

In order to keep context you would have to also maintain a state variable.

So now we have a weeks work of work, that has potential for other 'gotcha's in it. 

As opposed to one line.


[02/06/2023 5:37 PM] Satergo.com#0000
Respectfully, I said that I am not a JS programmer meaning that I do not write it as a job or hobby. I do however know the language extensively.

I am not sure why you are bringing up workers all of the sudden as you were talking about async await previously, but Firefox supports these as well. Implemented 6 years ago. And yes, multithreaded.

Now I do not know why you are even talking about this. Respectfully, I told you 3 times already that Firefox does support this functionality and even sent the announcement blog post.
I will run a snippet right now on Firefox to prove this for you.

`const res = await fetch("https://en.wikipedia.org");
console.log(await body.text());

`This works on Firefox and has for many many years. I do not wish to continue this discussion, you can choose to believe what you want but I would prefer to end this discussion here.


[02/06/2023 5:41 PM] Satergo.com#0000
I meant to write this. I changed it before running but the old text was kept in my clipboard.

`const res = await fetch("https://en.wikipedia.org");
console.log(await res.text());`


[02/06/2023 10:44 PM] networkspore#4282
if firefox will accept that code in some situations I'm surprised but I certainly have learned not to rely on it's implementation on anything.


[02/06/2023 10:50 PM] networkspore#4282
The truth is not that firefox has supported this for 6 years. They have tried to fake an implementation for 6 years.

https://spidermonkey.dev/blog/2021/04/05/top-level-await-ships.html
This article if from 2021 

Your trying to inform me about something I work with... while you don't work with it. IT's pretty rude.

{Embed}
https://spidermonkey.dev/blog/2021/04/05/top-level-await-ships.html
Top Level Await Ships with Firefox 89
Firefox will ship Top Level Await by default starting in Firefox 89. This new feature introduces a capability to modules allowing programmers to do asynchronous work, such as fetching data, directly at the top level of any module.
https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/ymMl5iQniyp0ht2ix1zZfOpHMoZeutjnwSUk0-PxnZw/%3F1/https/spidermonkey.dev/assets/img/twitter-dark-large.png


[02/06/2023 10:54 PM] networkspore#4282
The reason why I brought up workers, (and you would know this if you were talking about something that you actually work with), is that because firefox won't allow you to use await at the top level, you can't set a top level variable such as a hook, at instantiation.

If this is fixed as of writing this message that is awesome, less worry for me. But it certainly has not been supported for very long.


[02/06/2023 10:56 PM] networkspore#4282
And btw, I never intended to enter this discussion with you, you engaged it by pretending that you have expertise in something which you don't.


[02/06/2023 11:03 PM] networkspore#4282
And I mean since your name is satergo, how long did it take you to get more than a 5th grade level GUI, and you couldn't even do it yourself?

You put it off like it's beneath you, like your trying to put off file access in browsers (because it'd be like 'some sort of OS'), but lets be honest, you are just sold on your expertise and so are trying to make other areas seem less important.

All that is, is an excuse not to learn something new, because learning new things takes time, effort, and being a beginner means you don't know everything. Which apparently is very important to you. (even if you can't produce a passing example of it).


[02/06/2023 11:05 PM] networkspore#4282
Lets see your fantastic web design. Throw some webGL at me, make me impressed. Do you have the chops to actually back up your barking or are you a hack.


[02/06/2023 11:06 PM] Satergo.com#0000
You are incredibly rude. I have talked to you with respect and said nothing but facts. Top level is none of my business I was talking about the feature in general. I implemented the UI, the design was made by a professional designer. Not sorry for being a programmer.

You are not worth a millisecond of my time so I will proceed to ignore you from now on.

Worst wishes, hope to not see you ever again.

Whitepaper for my ergohack submission. 
https://github.com/networkspore/Netnotes

"The Chinese character for “enemy” means to be similar to or to answer — Don’t answer the machine — Shut if off —"
-William S. Burroughs

"Our natural bias is to accept the new gimmick as a thing that can be accommodated in the old ethical order...
[However] It is the art of the interval, rather than the art of the connection, (which is not only medieval but Oriental); above all, it is the art mode of instant electric culture.

I'm mainly going to work on documentation that allows people to implement all this on their own site soon. Never thought of a widget and not sure if it'll work with a dApp connector but would be fun to try

 Idea was to creat a simple drag and drop website builder for people to easily creat portfolio o marketplace, who has no knowledge of code


[02/09/2023 8:20 AM] hq3r#0000
And then, they can break the marketplace ", portfolio" in small sections and can implement "iframe" anywhere they want.... Doesn't need to he nfts, it can be token, WL tokens, vesting keys, etc... Kind of p2p exchange where you just drag and drop stuff

@CW what conditions/metrics/criteria will you use to determine a winner?


[02/25/2023 7:45 PM] CW#8500
With the vast and varying projects submitted for assessment throughout the history of ErgoHacks, judges are often left comparing apples to oranges.

Instead of trying to shoehorn projects into various categories or criteria, we are simplifying the judging process as much as possible and return to the judging process that occured at ErgoHack I. This allows the judges to apply subject/theme relevance and utilise their experience, knowledge and ecosystem awareness to assess and rank by the quality of the submission (ranked-choice voting).

The ranking points accumulated for each submission are then accumulated. The submission with the lowest points accumulated is considered first place, the second lowest is second place and so on.


[02/25/2023 10:29 PM] yb#3572
Sounds pretty fair. But it would be cool to create a tool where ERG holders can vote for what they need the most in the ecosystem☺️ maybe it is a project for the next ergohack🤔

We will also be holding a community vote for this hackathon as the raffle was funded - 1k ERG pool split between what the community votes for 1st, 2nd, 3rd

Can I withdraw my submission from the hack? I want to find a less aggressive type of relationship with the community and that means not competing against it, or talking about what I'm doing. I'll show you when it's done, but till then peace, I'm out.

 There is nthg bad in competing sir, you have hard worker and you have worked hard to put up a submission, as other have done too :) it's in your right to withdraw it . .but competition are always healthy

 Showing your work is more than competition, it's potentially an example and inspiration for others.

Unless there was some altercation you're referring to, I encourage you to stick around.

I don't even do these hackathons to try and win, I don't really care about that. It's just an excuse to work on something and see what other people can come up with. Don't think too hard about it.

 yeah I pretty much admit that I'm dragging down the average IQ here and just try to learn something 😆

Hey Guys, I'd like to know if there is open source code for building up a simple micro finance website?

Great videos from the last Ergohack. It's worth the time if you have it. 

Results will be released on Thursdays AMA @Ergo_Platform 

My little project SIPs got destroyed by the competition 😃.

I'll make a video for it this week.
