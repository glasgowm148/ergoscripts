@Andy Lowe are you free at some point before January to sit and bash this out one day. 22 or 23 works best for @Torto if that works for you. We can lean on the @Sigmanauts role too if we think anyone is suitable. Thinking maybe Noah, CryptoCream, and maybe Timreg might be suited?

hey, would love to do this. are you thinking maybe via zoom call? i definitely think this task is suited to real time communication considering the nuances of the message we are trying to convey. what time zone are you in @Torto? Maybe we can decide on a time and spend an hour or two and see what progress we can make and then schedule another call between xmas and ny


[12/21/2021 4:14 AM] Andy Lowe#6522
I noticed there were some sigmanaut candidates that had written their proposed improvement was relating to how to describe ergo and make it more accessible to everyday people. not sure how the sigmanaut enrollment process is going to happen but perhaps we could involve some of those people in some way, to get more brains on this task?


[12/21/2021 4:22 AM] Andy Lowe#6522
not highly important but i was wondering if there could be some way to animate that big erg logo at the top of the new website design, so that it turns to face where ever the mouse cursor is, like the metamask 3d face that follows you. could give a nice first impression of 'technical competency' as well as look cool. the angle of rotation could be limited so it always looks good and remains subtle. just an idea, not sure how easy it would be to implement

Yeah the first 30 SIGCANs will come in today - but we already have 20 or so already active too.


[12/21/2021 10:10 AM] glasgowm#9381
Think it's fairly straight-forward, keep in mind 60-80% of our traffic is likely mobile though.


[12/21/2021 10:11 AM] glasgowm#9381
Can you share device stats from the website @Dmitry Usov when you have a min. (device, resolution, or anything else that might be helpful)

23 for me is perfect because its my last day work on the year and them i will back to work on the website


[12/22/2021 5:33 PM] AngieHar#0865
@Torto Hey Marcelo, in regards to the upcoming website, when will we be able to get your proposal? we would need a brand book also with website 
and one more question, will we get a project manager from your firm?


[12/22/2021 5:44 PM] glasgowm#9381
proposal is up, will send you a copy


[12/22/2021 8:05 PM] Torto#5204
Hi @AngieHar you want a brandbook ID Guide for ERGO? To make a brandbook we need a branding project, a branding project from my perspective is a big thing, take time and research, (btw we have an interesting research team), it at the end generates a new design guide, talking about logo, ideals, strategic purposes and so on. Tbh idk I don't know if this is a cost priority for EF but I you want i can make a proposal.


[12/23/2021 12:40 PM] glasgowm#9381
Going to be working on content today with @Torto if yous are about @Andy Lowe @AngieHar at any point

Probably only need these dedicated pages to start
- Home
- Miners (Mine)
- Individuals (Explore)
- Developers (Build)

Thinking nice sharp pages, with lots of links to external sites within (ergodocs, ergo.watch, mining handbook, etc)


[12/23/2021 2:31 PM] glasgowm#9381
can we get most visited pages, and any other useful demographics @Dmitry Usov

Main things missing currently. So still 1 element to do, getting the video in - and then some small fixes. 

Then for the switchover we need
- redirect blog / any other URLs
- optimisation / cache
- finalising all the text and setting up a structure for translations
- @AndyLowe wanted to make an promo video for the launch
- Angie preparing announcement


could you put the site on a subdomain for now @eilemust ? beta.ergoplatform.org or something

For me it's easy to change the bg but I'm not sure if all other elements and svgs use the 121212 shade


[04/05/2022 5:33 PM] glasgowm#0000
I dont think they do - from when I was optimising the images, they‚Äôre all transparent and none should match the bg AFAIK

replace all and see how it looks. I‚Äôm not sure how those elements use the bg (roadmap for instance - is a diff shade)

[04/06/2022 8:05 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i was just going to download the html files and load them static on my end, showing the design changes without the need to login anywhere or update a repo. Tailwind is easy enough for change management, so if the changes are well liked then implementing them is as simple as replacing the html file

maybe add a hover class, but otherwise having it white to match the header of the links section makes it a bit 'wall of text' which makes one not want to read


[04/18/2022 4:26 PM] liquid_phase#4605
this could be due to Z-index

On a side note, it is now industry standard in design/development to design the mobile /responsive version first and build the site outward and bigger from that - instead of starting with desktop version and then trying to scale down. One is more work and backtracking than the other

discovered the issue with the gradients , or rather the SVG color space and filter settings being incorrect. I switched from sRGB to linearRGB colorspace and re-exported the SVGs with proper settings and updated the css mix-blend-mode to normal just in case and now we have relatively matching colors to figma, though the exposure/brightness is a bit duller on the web most likely because the designer is designing for sRGB monitor and color space where linearRGB is a limited pallete, but more widely used and more web standard

I don't notice any difference here, what am I looking at? Or is it because I have a sRGB monitor ?


[04/19/2022 9:08 PM] liquid_phase#4605
This is how it looks in other color spaces if you use sRGB when the monitor or OS is using a different color space. sRGB and Display p3 are standard for design and graphics for the level of saturation they can achieve in the green areas compared to linearRGB display profiles. The issue is, when you implement something for sRGB or DP3 where the majority of users are using linearRGB, you get issues like seen in my screen shot (i am using a 4k DisplayP3 monitor profile)

using linearRGB is a way to avoid these issues, but you miss out on certain features on the designer side such as getting that really saturated color on a monitor which supports it

A i will bring here some micro coments about the website if you don't mind

@glasgowm i've edited the SVGs and CSS classes so all the oranges are consistent throughout the site in all/most browser types and OSs .

My eyes are super tired so i can't work on more tonight, but tomorrow i can focus on more minor detail fixes as well, such as the waves background to the unique ergo container/hero and some of the contextual errors and such


[04/20/2022 3:13 AM] liquid_phase#4605
Would you like me to upload it somewhere now, or wait until i've finished?

Got through a good chunk yesterday - mobile video now loading properly, fixed up most of the gradients now, faq looking good. 

Some text fixes left, blog implementation, search - and then just css tidying mostly

It's not much right now I'll make a bigger comment next days. It's more of a micro detail.

1 - Adjustment of the main titles (leading)

2- Transition between dark and light mode needs to be smoother

3 - Add menu hamburger animation

[04/20/2022 4:06 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Well, yes. they were kinda messed up


[04/20/2022 4:06 PM] liquid_phase#4605
first needed to open in Visual studio code, remove two lines which were incorrect, and then it parsed in affinity properly


[04/20/2022 4:06 PM] liquid_phase#4605
in affinity i needed to then set blend mode from Passthrough to Normal


[04/20/2022 4:07 PM] liquid_phase#4605
and when i edited in vscode thats where i also changed the color space from sRGB to linearRGB

[04/20/2022 6:11 PM] liquid_phase#4605
might be a bit busy today, but i feel pretty comfortable in the site's code now and how it all functions and works together. All the CSS is simple enough, but some of it i think needs to have some new containers made which hold some existing ones to do things like add a consistent background shared among the cells of the 'unique ergo' subhero slider thingy


[04/20/2022 6:12 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Didn't want to mess around with that too much last night when my eyes were tired


[04/20/2022 6:15 PM] glasgowm#9381
Hmm wdym consistent background


[04/20/2022 7:07 PM] liquid_phase#4605
in figma, it shows waves at the bottom of the unique ergo slider which are not there in the code/css/there is not image file for them in the assets directory for that page


[04/20/2022 7:07 PM] liquid_phase#4605
or the component


[04/20/2022 7:09 PM] liquid_phase#4605
The component itself is in the code as <UniqueErgo /> (or whatever it is) but then going into the component it's coded to just be the slider itself instead of a container holding the slider. So either you need to be applying a div class to the component in index, or add the div section in the component file


[04/20/2022 7:10 PM] liquid_phase#4605
if you add the background waves image to the code as is, you need to apply it once for each cell, and it would call the image once for each cell change... better to simply apply a div container to the entire thing which has the background you want to persist through the slider motions


[04/20/2022 7:12 PM] liquid_phase#4605
dunno if i'm explaining it well - but i've actually done this before on  a website of my own using a similar waves thing to style a container class background.


[04/20/2022 7:15 PM] liquid_phase#4605
```<!-- component -->

     {{ /if }}
        {{ /form:mailing_list }}
        </div>
    </div>

</div>
{{ partial:instablock }}```
Here's some tailwind of my own from one of my own sites (mixed with laravel statamic, so ignore the {{ parameters }} )
The first div is the container holding the styled component but it also has the bg


[04/20/2022 7:19 PM] liquid_phase#4605
This way, the component container is has a separated background image class which can be affected differently by breakpoints as well - it makes for cleaner window scaling and easier compatibility for mobile

[04/21/2022 9:38 PM] liquid_phase#4605
@glasgowm from what i'm reading, safari mobile implemented data saving features for data-cap/low data/ cell use. There may be a way around it, but the article i read mentioned that the user has to do something in safari/network settings on their phone to enable videos to autoplay .


[04/21/2022 9:39 PM] liquid_phase#4605

[04/21/2022 9:39 PM] liquid_phase#4605
What i'm seeing is that people are simply applying a background image class to the same container the video is in, so that the container knows to default to the image if the video can't autoplay


[04/21/2022 9:40 PM] liquid_phase#4605
that's an option, another option is that we could render out the mp4 at a lower resolution as a gif(i can do this in photoshop pretty easily)


[04/21/2022 9:40 PM] liquid_phase#4605
and use breakpoints to load it instead of the mp4 if a user is on a device smaller than 420px wide

 I tried the gif implementation but the quality of the gif itself was too poor, it could work only if we have a better rendered gif


[04/21/2022 9:45 PM] liquid_phase#4605
There are specific settings to gif which need ti be applied. it will never look as good as the mp4, but it can definitely be adequate and good enough for mobile users if the other option is no video


[04/21/2022 9:46 PM] liquid_phase#4605

[04/21/2022 10:34 PM] A#0000
on desktop it doesn't look good but we can try and see what's the result on mobile


[04/21/2022 10:36 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Another idea to consider could be a mobile friendly/responsive version which uses js / css native animations on an SVG version of the logo... would be enacted through code that way . any 'way around' safari mobile limitation is actually implementing higher size gif than mp4, which is hilareous and not a very good solution for low data users.


[04/21/2022 10:37 PM] liquid_phase#4605
it wouldnt be as fancy as the video, but it would be something for browsers which can't see the video

[04/22/2022 2:36 PM] liquid_phase#4605
I think we should consider changing the Call to action button here to be White with orange text, and become orange/white on hover and when active

As it is now, the page which is active has an orange underline. it is not immediately apparent which page you are on because it feels like 'GET ERG' is the page you're always on

I would also recomend to move it either to the front or the end of the other menu items but having it in the middle is a bit wonky. my vote is after ecosystem

being a call to action, its already more noticable than what is around it. so needs to be weighed how important the other info is too.. the other menu items being very important - get drowned out by the button

can git clone from here https://source.cloud.google.com/ergo-341017/ergo-platform-frontend


[04/27/2022 3:58 PM] liquid_phase#4605
This is why each component needs to have a div container encapsulating the component either in the index code or the component itself, so that the component itself can be responsive to varying breakpoints


[04/27/2022 3:58 PM] liquid_phase#4605
as mentioned previously re: waves bg on uniqueergo


[04/27/2022 3:58 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i should have some time today i can dedicate to making the site responsive both up and down


[04/27/2022 4:00 PM] liquid_phase#4605
IMO responsiveness should always be the top of the list because changes to other components can break responsiveness at varying sizes


[04/27/2022 4:17 PM] A#0000
It looks like that because theres another slide with a lot more info (height). Theres a toggle in the slider library that will make it vertically responsive, but that will make the bottom part of the side go up and down  when the slide changes


[04/27/2022 4:19 PM] liquid_phase#4605
this being the case, probably better to have two versions of the slider, one specific to desktop and one specific to mobile which isn't a slider but each single slide at a time while scrolling.

 True


[04/27/2022 4:29 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Also, i notice we are not utilizing color harmonies anywhere on the site, would be good to consider these for big CTA's and specialized things. The closest we get on the site is the BPSAA partner logo, which if you look at it after scrolling the rest of the site is sort of a pallet refresher like ginger and sushi.

I'm not used to working this way, so i need to figure out a good workflow for pulling and merging as to not make any mess

That's not the production repo so mess away)

I wont update it so you'll just need to pull/push

[04/28/2022 12:37 PM] glasgowm#0000
Added `staging.` to test the switchover process. Seems CNAME‚Äôs aren‚Äôt instant anyway; https://dnschecker.org/#CNAME/staging.ergoplatform.org

{Embed}
https://dnschecker.org/
DNS Checker - DNS Check Propagation Tool
Check DNS Propagation worldwide. DNS Checker provides name server propagation check instantly. Changed nameservers so do a DNS lookup and check if DNS and nameservers have propagated.

[04/28/2022 12:38 PM] glasgowm#0000
but worst case @eilemust could always add a manual internal redirect `ergoplatform.org` -> `dev.ergoplatform.org`  until it resolves if there‚Äôs any issues during switchover.


[04/28/2022 12:39 PM] glasgowm#0000

Any further with blog urls A ?

Fixed up the get-erg header css a bit, couldn‚Äôt get `overflow:hidden` to work with `position:absolute` (even with parent divs) but just added more individual stylings for different resolutions

I noticed that the icon transition does not happen on mobile.  it only changes the icon. 

if that's the case it's better to leave the button smaller and adjust this transition

It could go at the bottom of get-erg under exchanges but would be conditional on the listing (or removed if discussions dont progress if easier) as it would devalue the site/brand and doesn‚Äôt really provide us any real benefit

 yep it can be in blog 
but it is needed to separate them so that journalists or users see those media activity separately 
-Blog posts 
- News ( internal) 
- Media about us ( external links)

In fact it would be good to compare site engagement metrics pre/post redesign to see how well we are doing to answer questions and move customers down funnel

(re  : *<curbsideprophet> In fact it would be good to compare site engagement metrics pre/post redesign to see how well we are doing to answer questions and move customers down funnel*) 
 
 Do we need any guest posting service for seeding do follow back links?


[05/23/2022 3:42 PM] AngieHar#0000
(re @AngieHar : *yep it can be in blog 
but it is needed to separate them so that journalists or users see those media activity separately 
-Blog posts 
- News ( internal) 
- Media about us ( external links)*) 
 
 @eilemust Dmitry, when will you have a chance to look into that request?

(re @curbsideprophetz : *yeah "search terms == keywords" and they are based on what current, future, and potential customers are searching for*) 
 
 So if, for example, we have a list of trending keywords ( simply from google trends) how do we embed them and increase g ranking?

(re @AngieHar : *So if, for example, we have a list of trending keywords ( simply from google trends) how do we embed them and increase g ranking?*) 
 
 it's a little more complicated than that but generally:
1) search term should be mentioned on the page
2) related keywords should also be mentioned on the page (ex: if you want to rank #1 for bitcoin you also want content around topics like satoshi nakamoto, proof of work, price trends, etc.)
3) target terms should be in the SEO meta data (ex: title tag, meta description) 
4) other pages on the site should link to your target page with the target anchor text
5) external websites should also point to the page using target or related terms

one more thing 
if you want to put a quote you can't make paragraphs between lines 
if you make a paragraph in the quote, then it reflects just one first line and other lines are plain text 

is it a way to adjust that?

subscript generator should work

https://lingojam.com/SubscriptGenerator


[06/07/2022 2:09 PM] glasgowm#9381
That's how it's supposed to work, you need to put another `> ` on every new line break. You can put `>` on a blank line to add spaces


[06/07/2022 2:09 PM] glasgowm#9381
This is because you have the spanish language selected, but yeh should ideally revert to `/en` in this case

Dear ERGO team,

I'm Roy from Coinstore, one of the fastest-growing CEX exchange based in Singapore.

As a Cardano enthusiast myself, I'm also part of the investors of Ergo for a year and I am excited about this emerging POW blockchain that is secure with a lot of similarities with Cardano using Haskel language. 

As such,  one of my personal goals in Coinstore is to be able to see more tokens from Cardano ecosystem to be listed on our exchange.

The cool thing about Coinstore is we are very dedicated to assisting every project, catering to your specific requirement during the period of listing. We are also active in attending several crypto & exhibitions this year and I be excited should your project can get promoted during these events.

Could we arrange a call for a quick introduction call? 

Hope to hear from you soon.

Roy

Hey, @AngieHar said we have problem with news on the blog page. We have only 20 last news on the page (but we need to show all of them because we have only one official source for news - website and users want to verify any news for any date) and we have hidden scroll on the desktop (bad ux for users). 

What you think if I move news for another page from blog? And will add infinity scroll like in the blog now?

 Hey Dmitry how are you? months ago I sent a font for when we had the site in Russian. I think it's a prettier and more appropriate font, I still have it with me here if I send it to you, could you change it?

I found some guy who will help us with seo/traffic/some users stories like this on screen


[10/04/2022 11:37 AM] glasgowm#0000
hosting extra pricey this month. I assume from extra traffic from merge? But way to much for hosting IMO. @eilemust could you look into caching solutions when you have some time?

(re @glasgowm : *hosting extra pricey this month. I assume from extra traffic from merge? But way to much for hosting IMO. @eilemust could you look into caching solutions when you have some time?*) 
 
 do you have links for price?


[10/04/2022 11:43 AM] eilemust#0000
how much it


[10/04/2022 11:43 AM] glasgowm#9381
You should have access via google cloud panel, under Billing


[10/04/2022 11:43 AM] glasgowm#9381
434GBP or something this month


[10/04/2022 11:43 AM] eilemust#0000

seems something wrong, I do not think that the price of hosting can increase

well if each request is hitting the cloud SQL it's charged per impression ?

[10/04/2022 11:45 AM] eilemust#0000
They can charge for storage I think


[10/04/2022 11:45 AM] eilemust#0000
Or increase some server parameters


[10/04/2022 11:45 AM] glasgowm#9381
Maybe someway to set it up so we just build it locally and push? No need to paying them those prices to build (If I'm understanding right what this is)

(re @tortodelivery : *you want to embed twitter in the homepage of the official ergo website?*) 
 
 Yeah, is it possible to have smth like an upper line with broadcast from twitter?


[01/24/2023 1:53 PM] AngieHar#0000
Or add a disclaimer box for immediate news


[01/24/2023 1:53 PM] AngieHar#0000
Like yoroi update

I was thinking about some place above the menu

(re @AngieHar : *Hmm, but it‚Äôs replacing one with another*) 
 
 y


[01/24/2023 1:57 PM] AngieHar#0000
If for disclaimer


[01/24/2023 1:58 PM] AngieHar#0000
(re @tortodelivery : *Maybe remove this LATEST NEWS and replace it with *Latest Twitts* for example*) 
 
 Because latest news are drafted by the editorial and some announcements are bigger than just a tweet 
And tweets are more instant news from the official channel


[01/24/2023 2:02 PM] Torto#0000
(re @AngieHar : *Because latest news are drafted by the editorial and some announcements are bigger than just a tweet

 yes i know. I just think some things need to be renounced so we don't become a confused Frankenstein of information. I'll think of somewhere and where that would fit well.

(re @tortodelivery : *yes i know. I just think some things need to be renounced so we don't become a confused Frankenstein of information. I'll think of somewhere and where that would fit well.*) 
 
 Yeah understand


[01/24/2023 2:03 PM] Torto#0000
On the top of the menu is definitely a place I don't like but we need to test also.


[01/24/2023 2:03 PM] Torto#0000
i don't like because the Header cannot confuse the user with more information.


[01/24/2023 2:03 PM] Torto#0000
Let me think about


[01/24/2023 2:04 PM] AngieHar#0000
It‚Äôs because I wanted it to be noticeable, so somewhere on the first screen

a kind of mobile popup where the user can move, open, close, read, but inserted inside the site. in the mobile version it will be simpler

so


[02/01/2023 2:26 AM] Torto#0000
in this test this popup can even be placed where the user wants it even closed, it will be inserted within the experience of the ergo website. always with the last post, without images and with the twitter feed clickable as a hyperlink to Ergo's twitter

[ergoplatform/ergoweb] Issue opened: #116 Proposed changes to Wallet section
### A few notes for the Ergo Wallets section: 

1. It's difficult to find. If I go to the Ergo landing page, the only way to find wallets it the "Get Erg" button, then the "Store It" link. This is not obvious. The Ethereum website, the very first menu item says "use ethereum" and at the top of the list is "find wallet". 
2. If I don't realize the "Store it" link will lead to a wallet (I didn't. I had to be told in the chat that it was a link at the top of the page), I have to scroll halfwa...

[ergoplatform/ergoweb] New comment on issue #116: Proposed changes to Wallet section
I agree with the comments that the current page is not particularily userfriendly for a total newbie to your community.
There are 3 types of users that will use he website:

1. Miners
2. Developers who want understand the ecosystem.
3. Users who just discovered ergo and want to buy and/or learn more


Of these 3 personas Miners and Developers will quickly be able to find what they need, they are incentivized to find the right info and will poke around unil they find what they need.

Thanks for opening the issue here! Sorry for the delay. 


1. User Journey

- Agree changing to 'Store It' -> 'Wallets' could help, I've got this one changed locally already and can push soon (battling with shite net!)
- Not sure it should be on it's own page unless we fleshed it out, nearer to the top might be better. Will speak to torto and see what he thinks.   
- Submenu is a good idea and easy enough to implement when @deadit is available


2. Wallet Section


- Agree about ...
