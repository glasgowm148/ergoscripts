[08/23/2022 6:11 PM] koutelier#5178
thank you. tomorrow i will write few things


[08/23/2022 10:05 PM] koutelier#5178
@curbsideprophet


[08/23/2022 10:05 PM] koutelier#5178
we can use this one


[08/23/2022 10:07 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
Very nice thanks man cc: @glasgowm too


[08/23/2022 10:10 PM] koutelier#5178
i am thinking about two bots.


[08/23/2022 10:10 PM] koutelier#5178
one for prices and one for faq


[08/23/2022 10:10 PM] koutelier#5178
keep things clean


[08/23/2022 10:10 PM] koutelier#5178
wdyt ?


[08/23/2022 10:11 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
That‚Äôs fine with me to keep things lean


[08/23/2022 10:11 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
I can create separate repo but will look to you for more creative name @koutelier lol


[08/23/2022 10:12 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
It is an easy fork for existing sigmabot for me


[08/23/2022 10:13 PM] koutelier#5178
i am only good for funny names lol. we can vote for that later.


[08/23/2022 10:13 PM] koutelier#5178
sigmabot for prices and something else for faq


[08/23/2022 10:13 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
Easier to manage restrictions anyway

glasgow will allow sigmabot only in baseless and trading channel . will make our work easier as well


[08/23/2022 10:14 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
Maybe sigmabot remove all .spf function and make that a separate spectrumbot instead


[08/23/2022 10:14 PM] koutelier#5178
yeah


[08/23/2022 10:14 PM] koutelier#5178
.price comet could work etc


[08/23/2022 10:15 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
Ok I‚Äôll have to rework some code not a problem then easy peasy


[08/23/2022 10:15 PM] koutelier#5178
the sigmabot is perfect. just rebrand lol (add help)


[08/23/2022 10:16 PM] koutelier#5178
for the faqbot we need to add multiple informations to save us a lot of time from anwsering the same question over and over again


[08/23/2022 10:16 PM] koutelier#5178
it could auto respond but maybe will be a mess .


[08/23/2022 10:18 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
We can improve over time


[08/23/2022 10:18 PM] curbsideprophet#5083

[08/23/2022 10:19 PM] koutelier#5178

[08/24/2022 6:36 PM] koutelier#5178
make sense like that @curbsideprophet


[08/24/2022 6:36 PM] koutelier#5178
move


[08/24/2022 6:36 PM] koutelier#5178
whatever has to do with wallets and funds needs to be on the other bot


[08/24/2022 6:41 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
ok keeping track here: https://github.com/Eeysirhc/sigmabot/issues/12


[08/24/2022 6:42 PM] koutelier#5178
okay will do


[08/24/2022 6:42 PM] koutelier#5178
i think for tg we shouldn't add all tokens tg channel links


[08/24/2022 6:42 PM] koutelier#5178
just add a command for tokens and the bot will reply with @ergochats


[08/24/2022 6:42 PM] koutelier#5178
if anyone asks about tokens


[08/24/2022 6:43 PM] koutelier#5178
this is not a faq question though so not important imo


[08/24/2022 6:43 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
sounds good


[08/24/2022 9:46 PM] koutelier#5178
We need more people to help in different areas.


[08/24/2022 9:51 PM] curbsideprophet#5083

@curbsideprophet  check now


[08/25/2022 6:57 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
added comments in "notes" category


[08/25/2022 7:01 AM] koutelier#5178
Need to figure out how to give you access after work


[08/25/2022 7:04 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
i can edit it no problem. just asking you to take a look on direction


[08/25/2022 8:41 AM] koutelier#5178
Oh okay. I will in few hours


[08/25/2022 5:27 PM] koutelier#5178
@curbsideprophet saw your notes


[08/25/2022 5:27 PM] koutelier#5178
agree. didn't get the sigmaverse


[08/25/2022 5:28 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
`.sigmaverse` just gives you link to website. 
`.sigmaverse tools` would list out all the websites under the tools category on sigmaverse


[08/25/2022 5:28 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
`.sigmaverse dapps` would do the same as above but dapps


[08/25/2022 5:28 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
etc


[08/25/2022 5:28 PM] koutelier#5178
hhmm i think too complicated


[08/25/2022 5:29 PM] koutelier#5178
we should focus on tutorials mainly


[08/25/2022 5:29 PM] koutelier#5178
nodes, wallets , and how to buy erg


[08/25/2022 5:29 PM] koutelier#5178
this things mostly imo


[08/25/2022 5:29 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
then remove `sigmaverse` altogether?


[08/25/2022 5:29 PM] koutelier#5178
at least at the beginning .


[08/25/2022 5:30 PM] koutelier#5178
nope. because there they can do their research . so if anyone comes and asks what projects ergo has


[08/25/2022 5:30 PM] koutelier#5178
.sigmaverse


[08/25/2022 5:30 PM] koutelier#5178
and they can find out


[08/25/2022 5:30 PM] koutelier#5178
we can put some text there as well, before the link


[08/25/2022 5:30 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
ok if it's easy to do i'll add it anyway


[08/25/2022 5:31 PM] koutelier#5178
okay sir. ergopixely has great tutorials


[08/25/2022 5:31 PM] koutelier#5178
we need to add these as well


[08/25/2022 5:57 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
@koutelier for `.wallets` - what about default option? should we link to ergoplatform wallets page?


[08/25/2022 5:57 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
i think it would be good because right now it just returns an error


[08/25/2022 5:58 PM] koutelier#5178
error?


[08/25/2022 5:58 PM] koutelier#5178
why


[08/25/2022 5:58 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
3 modifiers: `.wallets dis`, `.wallets tg`, `.wallets cold`

Tomorrow I will try to find some time to finish to finish the tutorial about ledger and then find few more tutorials that are helpful

[08/27/2022 12:08 AM] koutelier#5178

i have no preference


[09/01/2022 9:17 AM] koutelier#5178
Should we add the sideload guides for ledger . The one I made and the existed ones ?

of course!

@glasgowm up to you which channels you want this bot to live under (maybe #üó£‚îÇgeneral at a minimum?) but I think right now its only #sigmanauts-archive

Yeah, surprisingly.


[09/06/2022 3:55 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
lmao. we can use this channel for sigmabot work and testing


[09/06/2022 3:55 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Sounds good.


[09/06/2022 4:01 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
your PR i left a code review comment but this is one discussion point
```re: faq.py line #91: Or, each string can be personalized to the exchange.

Might be harder to maintain but I am opening up to the idea of having more specific calls for each dapp/project/etc.

For example: instead of .listing coinbase .listing kraken it would just be .coinbase .kraken.
Another example: .projects ergopad .projects skyharbor .projects azorus it would just be .ergopad .skyharbor .azorus

Pro: easier to remember, good for mobile
Con: could get messy if we need to edit two files faq.py and sigmabot.py...especially if we add modifiers```


[09/06/2022 4:05 PM] cafebedouin#9837
The problem we will have with this bot is the information is like a directory, it's going to require frequent up-dating as a matter of course.


[09/06/2022 4:07 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Modifiers is good programming practice, so just plugging in a variable for name and using the same language is easy to code, but the problem with that in this case is that the information may not led itself to it. Also, if the purpose is to be easy, easier to do /binance than /listing binance


[09/06/2022 4:08 PM] cafebedouin#9837
So trade-offs. I think the main metric is use. If people are using it to answer the common questions, then it's a success. If not, then we should rethink the organization until they do.


[09/06/2022 4:10 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
maybe for v3.0 we pipe in from sigmaverse structure heh


[09/06/2022 4:11 PM] cafebedouin#9837
That was a thought too, we don't want to recreate that. I do like the idea of a / command with links, since most people cannot post them.

huh, so wick thinks that explanation is too long, and may be right.


[09/06/2022 4:14 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Still getting the spacing tab problems?


[09/06/2022 4:15 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
depends how complicated we want to get. for example `.projects azorus token` is a lot of arguments. but `.azorus token` is easier for the end user but could get messy on back end

I had originally planned to just make that a no modifer one, then realized that the discord/tg dichotomy was in play.

[09/06/2022 5:20 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
it looks like the bot gets put into timeout though for using discord invite links with `.nfts`


[09/06/2022 5:23 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Mentioned in sigmanauts it might make sense to have an nft channel on platform. Might be the way around thta one.

Do you try to do any technical analysis for trading? For instance, it would be super interesting to have a probability table for price impact on listing announcement over some series: day, week month, quarter, and year. For today, what is the probability price will get to $15 from start of trade to 30 days out, any time.


[09/08/2022 2:10 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
Yes I have a bunch of stochastic models living on local computer just for fun. What‚Äôs up?


[09/08/2022 2:11 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
For something like this I also tried survival analysis I would need to dig up legacy code


[09/08/2022 2:11 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
Sort of a ‚Äútime to pamp since listing‚Äù metric


[09/08/2022 2:12 AM] cafebedouin#9837
I do geopolitical forecasting as a sideline. So, the Huobi listing strikes me as a similar type of question. I was using the KuCoin listing as a point of comparison, but be better if there was a cross-chain model/data for that sort of thing.


[09/08/2022 2:13 AM] cafebedouin#9837
There was also that study about Coinbase listing I posted on Reddit. Let me find.

?


[09/08/2022 4:13 PM] glasgowm#9381
You can just link https://docs.ergoplatform.com/contribute/

Yeah good to ID them when evoking that command


[09/08/2022 6:36 PM] koutelier#5178
so it will be like .cex no kyc and .cex kyc ? and another command for just .cex?


[09/08/2022 6:36 PM] koutelier#5178
i think it's better to leave one command but categories them on the bot reply


[09/08/2022 6:36 PM] koutelier#5178
easier to use


[09/08/2022 9:34 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
No just .cex but add extra spacing in response between KYC and none

While Proof of Useful Work is an interesting idea, it is still in its research phase. Ergo is open to implementing new ideas. But, a radical change to its concensus mechanism that requires a hard fork would likely be outside the scope and resources of Ergo's small core development team and limited budget.

Why does Getblok get a call out in a broader mining command? Seems like we should refine what we want to show then since it also includes modifiers to channels

imo we should separate personal preferences and statement of facts which in this case 2miners is an ergo mining pool. so unless that gets delisted from the website then my vote is we leave it on (but can move it lower on the order)

.difficulty


[09/20/2022 6:58 PM] sigmabot#9505
Ergo's difficulty algorithm was designed to reduce the incentive to perform coin-hopping and improve stability of inter-block delays. Coin-hopping is defined as an adversarial miner switching from mining one coin to another in the beginning of an epoch then switching back in the beginning of next epoch when difficulty becomes lower. Difficulty in Ergo is adjusted using the least squares method, which adjusts roughly every two weeks using the past eight epochs to obtain a target block interval of 120 seconds or 2 minutes, on average.

Adjusts roughly every two weeks? I think we're accidentally using Bitcoin timeframes here


[09/20/2022 7:39 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
8 epochs = roughly 8192 blocks = ~720 blocks/day = 11.38 days

more than happy to revise the wording if you can paste it here (edit: this was from @cafebedouin PR)


[09/20/2022 7:55 PM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
Well it adjusts based on the last 8 epochs, ‚Åì11 days. But, the adjustment itself occurs every epoch, ‚Åì34 hours (with ideal conditions).

Well anything is possible it just depends on what you want to do. 

If it‚Äôs server content delivery and moderation then yeah there are already 1000 and 1 discord bots that can do what you are asking.

Sigmabot is a fork of curbsideBOT which was meant for me to learn and have fun in spectrum discord for bots and devops. Additional benefit and can‚Äôt speak for @cafebedouin but seems like there was others who learned more about open source coding and collaboration.

So yeah I can code it but if we think we need something more versatile and this has out lived its usefulness then yeah we can definitely scrap it for something else

cc: @koutelier


[09/21/2022 9:15 PM] cafebedouin#9837
As someone barely functional with git, I appreciate the desire to want to make it easier to add content. On the other end of it, as someone who made his living putting together information for people, the more you open it up, the more you have to have formal structure. If it's three people who get along, no worries. Add in more then you have group dynamics that need to be managed, issues about what "the voice" of sigma-bot should be, etc. Personally, I think the solution is to point people not conversant with git to the issue tracking page in the github repo. Github already has all the formal management built-in, and it would probably be best just to use it, rather than go the not invented here route. My $0.02.

Of course, I'm sure there are bots out there that have more functionality for this kind of thing, but another question is: do we need it? Who will manage it? Etc. I think sigma-bot is a huge help for all the repeat questions we get. I think it can probably adequately meet that need. But, maybe I'm missing something?

Also, noticed the open issue of logo and made something simple. If you want something more involved. Let me know what. I'm not an artist, but this is something I can do.


[09/21/2022 10:11 PM] koutelier#5178
no way the bot has out lived its usefulness i just proposed that because i though such a function could help people with no dev skills add commands and replies without interrupting you so often lol the bot is very usefull the way it is and you made it so it answers all faq

[09/21/2022 11:10 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
hehe yeah i know where you are coming from and it's a good break from normal work for me. i think a decent proposal to solve for this could be: 
1) deploy github CI/CD: https://github.com/Eeysirhc/sigmabot/issues/47
2) make @koutelier @cafebedouin github collaborators (and anyone else we think should have it as a sigmanaut/ergonaut) that way you can commit to repo without needing me to approve PRs but also you can approve PRs from others
3) then any PR that gets approved and pushed to repo the bot would auto update to latest version


[09/21/2022 11:37 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
and LMAO i realize i didnt even answer your question @koutelier: the answer is yes.
right now the bot is a ridiculously simple script but what you are suggesting would require permissions management, workflow management (input from discord > push to github > then load changes), etc. i can add as a to-do in the issues backlog


[09/22/2022 12:25 AM] cafebedouin#9837

Think I fixed. Sorry about the muff up here. I was trying to cut and paste to show it here and mg did something weird after I justified it that I didnt catch. I probably need to figure out how to run it before pushing, so I can see the runtime errors myself.

[09/23/2022 7:40 PM] sigmabot#9505
[Tweaking Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm]
The Ergo's algorithm works well in most cases, inluding huge price drops, 100x initial difficulty misestimation during mainnet launch, and so on. However, current simplified and limitless version of algorithm is bumpy. Big influx of mining hashrate over multiple epochs, especially with super-linear hashrate growth over time may result in huge spike of difficulty. Similarly, few slow epochs may cause huge drop. Also, for dapps and other applications it would be desirable to make difficulty readjustment more reactive (currently, readjustment takes place every 1024 blocks, and 8 epochs, so about two weeks normally, are considered).

No, was thinking of adding the EIP-37 discussions link to .difficulty

[09/23/2022 9:32 PM] cafebedouin#9837
@curbsideprophet It's nice to be able to see run time errors. Now, I can see all the problems with spacing / tabs that my editor introduces before passing to you. So, I can go back to using normal emacs. Added a PR, works for me.

[09/23/2022 9:34 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Also, I was thinking that we should pile the faq functions into a function directory, where sigmabot/main/functions/wen.py can sit and we can just create a new file when adding a new function.


[09/23/2022 9:35 PM] cafebedouin#9837
That's a design choice, and completely up to you. Also, I don't know python well enugh to know what would need to change to make that happen.


[09/23/2022 9:36 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
I like this idea to break them out into separate files. Originally thought about consolidating into single file for everything (see .eip) but it‚Äôs looking pretty messy


[09/23/2022 9:36 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
I also have an issue where I am talking to myself about it but I think what you mentioned is also a cleaner solution


[09/23/2022 9:37 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
I will have to review implementation


[09/23/2022 9:37 PM] cafebedouin#9837
More your area. I could try to do it, but I would have to learn more about Python that you already know.


[09/23/2022 9:38 PM] cafebedouin#9837

.why pow @cafebedouin


[09/24/2022 12:21 AM] sigmabot#9505
Every blockchain solution requires a careful consideration of costs, benefits and risks. Blockchains are a big tent. There is room for everyone. However, PoW NIPoPows and chain-specific features like storage rent offers unique functionality that can be worth the extra energy expenditure of PoW for some blockchain uses.

The Ergo team welcomes partnerships. However, it is helpful to see and have Ergo's engineers understand partner code first. Projects without code are hard to distinquish from mere marketing. Ergo's focus is on engineering. Please contact team@ergoplatform.org when you are ready to share your code with Ergo's developers.

Also, I ran that code and it worked. Does it show an error somewhere? I think these errors come from me just copy and pasting and windows does something weird to the formatting. Or the editor does.


[09/24/2022 12:36 AM] curbsideprophet#5083
yeah indent error. when i run sigmabot on prod it doesnt give a response until i fix it. so somewhere along the way it adds an extra indent

[09/28/2022 8:43 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
the TG bridge bot brings in all "reply threads" as one text chunk. so sigmabot just thinks it's a normal message and doesn't see the command later in the text

Storage rent is a fee for long term storage on the Ergo blockchain. Four years from your last transaction, you will be charged ~0.14 ERG and a transaction fee to pay for the costs of storing your digital information.

Ergo Explorer displays circulating supply and max supply (97,739,924 ERG). Multiply these amounts by current price to get Ergo's market capitalization. Do not rely on Coinmarketcap data. ERGs value derives from the popularity and utility of the platform + the cost of mining erg.
