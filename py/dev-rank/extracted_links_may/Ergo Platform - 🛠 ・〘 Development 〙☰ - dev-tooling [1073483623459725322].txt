I cannot get my head around how the development discord channels work?
I've selected explorer from the channels & roles, but it never shows in my navbar. I have to search for it across all of ergoplat discord and then find a random topic before it becomes available. And next day it's gone...
I can see the ergpy topic/thread, but that's not available in the menu/channel list.

Is it just me, or is it harder to find things now?

Most channels work as usual, I've collapsed the ones that can be categorised as 'tooling' into threads in this category. You shouldn't need to search - just come here. I forgot to remove it from that channels and role pane sorry.

To get these to stay on your sidebar send a message in the thread and that should be you. 

This section made most sense and de-clutter the server collapse for a few reasons
- This section will be constantly growing
- Mostly used by devs on Discord (unbridged)
- kushti wanted more chats in #🛠│development during the bear and less dev channels, so if people end up there for discussions no issue, can come to threads for longer discussions.

SO what i'm hearing here is that... it's okay to spam #🛠│development  chat, can you please confirm this for me good sir @glasgowm :kekw:


[03/10/2023 6:18 PM] glasgowm#9381
Just you stay in #deleted-channel, you've already almost over-taken the chats that have been here for years in messages 😅
