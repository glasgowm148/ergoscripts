SigmaO intends to provide Ergo users the ability to create Call or Put options on EIP-4 tokens, materialized by a standard EIP-4 token.

Reminder: An option contract offers the buyer the possibility but not the obligation to buy (Call) or sell (Put) the underlying asset at a fixed exercise price.

A sample usage of SigmaO contracts:

Update:
- the new UI in progress: 
    -create, buy, sell, exercise options pages have a fist version.
    - I'm working on the display of compound options (options on options)
    - A presentation page and a user dashboard are still to be done.
- The off-chain bot is in draft
Trying to get it in test before the end of the week.

Display of compound option is done.
The user dashboard minimal version is available.
Adding a new "open sale token" contract matching an "open buy token" contract.
First sale done, still need to work on the limits.

Open buy order contract allows to create an exercible buy order on any EIP-4 token.
It includes an amount or ERG to be spent by anyone providing the right amount of a given token in the outputs(1) of the transaction sent to the buyer address.
Focusing on the result, the buy order can be spent by any address or smart contract delivering the right amount of tokens.
It is used in Sigmao to buy priced options or any EIP-4 token at fixed price.

SigmaO UI is now deployed for testing: https://www.sigmao.cc/ 
Be careful and use small amounts for testing.

Let starts to have fun:
    A compound option Call on Put COMET is available, as well as few other tests.
    It can be purchased using a SigmaO (https://www.sigmao.cc/buy-tokens), and one is also available in the Auction House !
    https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/specific/c064f0b6aecaddc0457648e56598f1cb6a35668c9a139759149a91cc8bf4e1a1
  *Grant to buy at 0.0050 ERG the grant to Sell COMET per 10000 at 8000 nanoERG per COMET up to the 2023-03-20*

Please leave comments and questions here.

@haileypdll viewing the website i find it very overwhelming amount of information as a new user who doesnt know much about options and it‚Äôs intimidating. I think could benefit from some better ux to simplify things. There was a designer looking for a team would you be interested in collaborating with them? @inspiredude

Hey, thanks for the feedback. I would probably need a designer or advices because I don't really see how to address it. On one side there is already too much information, but I would need to add even more to explain in details.


[02/18/2023 4:54 PM] glasgowm#9381
Dashboard could be an icon next to your ERG address

For the rest of the menu items you could have
`CREATE ‚îÇ EXERCISE ‚îÇ BUY ‚îÇ SELL ‚îÇ TOKENS`
or simply
`OPTIONS ‚îÇ TOKENS`

and lots of tool-tips on hover to explain things


[02/18/2023 4:57 PM] haileypdll#3353
thanks, I will try to improve


[02/18/2023 5:03 PM] glasgowm#9381
np, looks very functional! Options are probably a bit abstract for most people though so your biggest hurdle is probably not scaring people away. ChatGPT is handy for writing ELI5 explainers and simplfying things a bit.

The "Greeks"(or at least the two most meaningful imo) of long & short options:
Long call  =  positive delta & negative theta.
Long put  =  negative delta & negative theta
Short put =  positive delta & positive theta
Short call =  negative delta & positive theta


[04/16/2023 7:52 AM] NoahErgo#0000
@ThierryM1212 thinking about sigmaO, i was thinking a prediction market could be created in a similar way using the oracle pool prices

A user could create a bet token with a reserve of erg with some date and time metadata, i.e. on block number 1000000 i think erg will be above price x

The bet token could be placed on market for whatever price. Whoever owns the token after that block is up can claim the reserve if the bet hits, otherwise the original bet creator can reclaim their reserve if the bet does not hit, in addition to the premium they got from selling the bet initially.


[04/16/2023 7:53 AM] NoahErgo#0000
I imagine the ‚Äúclaim‚Äù of the reserve could be done similarly to how liquidations on sigmafi are done manually after certain block

An options contract is an agreement between two parties that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset (such as a stock, commodity, or currency) at a specific price and time in the future. The buyer of the option pays a premium to the seller for this right.

There are two types of options: call options and put options. A call option gives the buyer the right to buy the underlying asset at a specific price, while a put option gives the buyer the right to sell the underlying asset at a specific price.

The price at which the underlying asset can be bought or sold is known as the strike price, and the specific time in the future when the option can be exercised is known as the expiration date.

If the buyer of the option decides to exercise their right to buy or sell the underlying asset, the seller of the option is obligated to fulfill the transaction at the agreed-upon price. However, if the buyer chooses not to exercise their option, the seller keeps the premium paid by the buyer and the option expires worthless.

The price of an options contract, also known as the premium, is determined by a number of factors, including the current market price of the underlying asset, the strike price of the option, the time until expiration, the volatility of the underlying asset, and the prevailing interest rates. 

The market price of the underlying asset is the most important factor influencing the price of an options contract. If the underlying asset is highly volatile and has a high chance of moving significantly in price, the options contract will be more expensive. 

The strike price of the option is also important. If the strike price is very close to the market price of the underlying asset, the options contract will be more expensive. 

The time until expiration is also a significant factor. The longer the time until expiration, the more expensive the options  <clipped message>

        The theory usually involves a lot financial mathematics tools you probably don't know (measure theory, functional analysis, stochastic processes, stochastic integration, stochastic differential equations).

But here is some intuition:
1.) Choose a stochastic process (e.g., geometric brownian motion, fractional brownian motion) for your asset price (usually stocks, in this case tokens). 

2.) Change probability measure to the risk neutral measure (also called equivalent martingale measure). This measure makes sure that you are calculating 'fair' prices in some sense (look up the first and second fundamental theorems of asset pricing respectively their more general counterparts like the 'no free lunch with vanishing risk' theorem).

3.) Derive closed form solutions for option prices like in the Black-Scholes model with geometric brownian motion (see wikipedia for formulas + greeks) or use monte carlo simulations to get prices. Choose parameters to fit your data.

There is also some cool theory about relations between the value of options (e.g., duality relations between calls and puts) so that if you know one pricing formula you can get the other one easily.

If you really want to start digging into this direction then one usually starts with discrete time models (meaning time steps 1,2,3,..  instead of continuous time). The most famous discrete time model is the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model (price can only go up or down by fixed factors each time step), which is also called binomial model. If you have basic knowledge in probability theory and linear algebra on undergraduate level you might be able to follow lecture notes about discrete time finance and derivations of the fundamental theorems of asset pricing. The CRR model is still very powerful and is able to approximate the Black-Scholes-Merton model if one m <clipped message>

Scholes and Merton received the nobel memorial prize in economics for their work on derivative pricing (Black died before that). Just to highlight that these theories and models are really important results and not just some niche mathematics.

        SigmaO pricing formula tries to provide a parametrizable function to approximate Black Sholes results. It needed to be implementable in ergoscript... I would say it does its best without floating point number, loops, log, exp, or even native SQRT... As a minimum it tries to follow the intrisic price of the option and compute a "time value" decreasing with the time.
