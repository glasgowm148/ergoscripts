Probit API is not resilient, sometimes when I make a call to create an order I got error, while the order is actually created. This is very confusing and is breaking current market making strategy‚òπÔ∏è  Saw this behaviour earlier on Probit, but I've created an issue for them only just now, will see.

I personally like Exmo, but 10 BTC is definitely too high price for them.  Probably they (and other exchanges) will reduce their price after okex listing, so let's hope for okexü§û

Coineal: "Though we do not offer free listing, we accept payment of listing fee in tokens"


[01/27/2020 10:03 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
I can't find an API of Coineal, also volume looks >99% fake


[02/17/2020 10:39 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ bad news: just had a call w. Kat, she says OKEX is changing listing rules, so now they're listing only coins already listed on Binance / Huobi / Bittrex / Bitthumb / UpBit and charging a security deposit of 100 BTC. So they're going to refund the listing fee. She's going to join MXC exchange as vice-president soon and suggesting to consider listing there (she's calling MXC tier-1.5 exchange).

[02/17/2020 10:39 AM] kushti#0978
So let's rework our listing strategy also.


[02/17/2020 10:48 AM] kushti#0978
I would like to suggest to get on exchanges via voting whenever possible (votings good for promotion also) or which can accept Ergs. 2-3 new exchanges are okay for now I guess.


[02/17/2020 11:45 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
That is bad news indeed.


[02/17/2020 12:11 PM] kushti#0978
Yes, but we need to go further anyway


[02/18/2020 2:12 PM] kushti#0978
ok so we target MXC / TradeOgre / KuCoin PoW coins voting contest / Citex now

not much probably (

yes


[05/11/2020 6:59 PM] mx#5165
and these exchanges without public stats may have some purpose actually later so nothing to lose i guess with this price


[05/11/2020 7:41 PM] kushti#0978
for Citex we paid in ergs only


[05/11/2020 7:51 PM] mx#5165
try to propose the same


[05/11/2020 7:59 PM] kushti#0978
possible but they're asking for 2x in tokens


[05/11/2020 7:59 PM] kushti#0978
so maybe more efficient to sell OTC and pay USDT


[05/11/2020 7:59 PM] mx#5165
citex was something like 0.4 btc in Ergs? yes if that`s the case

[06/10/2020 6:16 AM] Justin1000#9555
So lots of great things going on and great news flow and see on Fund Board we are ready and willing to promote.I just want to point as someone already did on the Telegram, the news effect is somewhat limited by lack of top tier exchanges so as far as I see it, that is now top priority. Hopefully with all the news flow and any promotion that is done will get a top tier exchange to list Ergo ASAP and finally the price can begin to reflect the news and real value. But I encourage everyone to keep in mind importance of top exchange!!!


[06/10/2020 6:18 AM] Justin1000#9555
I will share the news with Bitfinex in next 24 hours now that it is out. But as mentioned, I am not too optimistic on them based on past discussions. I would note they never listed Cardano. I do not know but their may be some things in the background with IOHK/Cardano/Bitfinex we are not aware of. Just guessing. But anyway, I'll contact them again.


[06/10/2020 6:19 AM] Justin1000#9555
Binance would be the best. And may actually have highest chance. They listed Cardano, Ravencoin and tons of other coins as you know. Hope you continue to push whatever contacts you have there! And make sure they are 100% aware of all the positive developments happening!


[06/10/2020 6:41 AM] Justin1000#9555
"I wanted to let you know what is happening on Ergo:
-Emurgo cooperation announced ‚Äì biggest development to-date: https://emurgo.io/en/blog/emurgo-to-partner-with-ergo-and-build-blockchain-based-decentralized-financial-solutions
-Will be first coin integrated into their wallet after Cardano
-Multiple wallets already and ledger support coming too
-Tons of other stuff happening. You can just go the twitter to have a look and get a feel if you like: https://twitter.com/ergoplatformorg
-They have been working non-stop for the past year since launch despite the low price. They are hardcore serious team and among the very best developers in the entire industry
-Community and interest much bigger now
-Critical missing component is a top tier exchange. The top devs asked me to reach out to you guys again which I planned to do anyway after this latest news.
-Not sure why so far no interest from Bitfinex. But I would highlight: `
1) Now there is almost 20 million Ergs outstanding so could be pretty liquid token
2) There is likely to be a lot of buying interest from people who see the news but can‚Äôt get in because of the poor exchange listings ‚Äì seen this stated numerous times in the telegram Chat. Even my Dad wants to buy it
3) There will be selling interest from the miners who are mining it. There is 6.83TH of hash power behind this coin despite the low price to-date! All GPUs. https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/
4) Given (1)-(3) above, upon the first top exchange listing I guess the volume and liquidity will be high and the price MUCH higher than today meaning big fees for the exchange that list it. 
5) Based on trading volume I calculated Binance made about US$1 million in trading volume in first ~20 days post Ravencoin listing in Oct-2018 and that was less than 1 year post its launch. And honestly, Ravencoin is a piece of crap compared to Ergo

Liquid: $150+K


[06/13/2020 12:51 AM] Justin1000#9555
Liquid might be worth considering if get fee lower and are willing to take part in Ergs as "partners". Took quick look and seems solid exchange open to everyone. Looks easy to set up an account and do KYC. Tons of Fiat. Its the 5th biggest exchange on BTI.live in real volume. BUT, 1) Seems volume totally dominated by BTC/JPY and BTC/USD (like 85-90%); 2) Paying such a large amount would be costly and set bad precedent. So I guess its a no-go but should keep in mind anyway. A binance listing would be far superior and hopefully free....seems market totally dominated by them now.

etoroX : $100K


[06/15/2020 5:58 PM] kushti#0978
wtf with those exchanges


[06/16/2020 5:40 AM] Justin1000#9555
> etoroX : $100K
@kushti What may be happening is they take one look at coinmarketcap and see the market cap of only US$5 million, then they immediately assume it has limited following and not much trading fee potential so just look for listing fees. Think need to emphasize that 1) ~20 million tokens now mined; 2) Will be first big exchange to list it so the volume should be substantial as there is big pent-up interest in acquiring the coins from people who are following the project; 3) will do marketing around listing to make more interest; 4) Ravencoin listed on Binance and they made around $1million in just 20 days trading it


[06/16/2020 5:41 AM] Justin1000#9555
They want money and Ergo doesn't have it right now so got to try and convince them the trading fees will be substantial. And the price will be higher and they can get Ergs in exchange for listing as opposed to a lot of $. Not sure will work but seems you should be bringing these points up at least in conversations you have with exchanges.


[06/16/2020 12:01 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 yeah, and it seems we need to get big players / proper MM even before big exchanges even. With proper MM traders will come, then exchanges will follow.

[06/17/2020 4:57 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Took a look to Liquid some time ago - nice exchange, but most of tokens are not liquid) According to CMC, 93% of the volume is in BTC/JPY pair, so roughly just $10M for all other tokens, so  it is actually relatively small


[06/17/2020 4:58 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Bittrex is also quite small right now...

I contacted Virgilo at Gate.io but he was worthless as usual. Said just put in a application and they would revert. I think @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ will put in another app soon when he has time. (I applied 2x in 2019...). If any ideas or contact in getting listed there, should definitely make a push. They are Top 10 on BTI.live and had history of listing PoW coins. Now is good time to list Ergo and they would be perfect exchange to list on before jumping to a bigger one!

Again, I would just point out Binance seems to be totally dominating the exchange market in real volume now. On BTI.live, it is 15x bigger than #2! So stating obvious again but that is the real goal is to get listed on Binance. Even more important now than was in 2019.

@Justin1000 we had a call with Gleb in May. He said that a chance it would be much better to get listed on some other big exchange first and then he can send another request to the listing committee. Market-making is desirable also though.


[06/22/2020 4:21 PM] kushti#0978

talking w. BiBox, seems we can pay most in ergs


[06/30/2020 8:19 PM] mx#5165
Tokok sounds ok, Bibox would be ~250k Erg?


[06/30/2020 8:26 PM] kushti#0978
@mx will try to cut down Tokok price, and bargaining hard about Bibox


[06/30/2020 8:26 PM] kushti#0978
@mx we need for crowdfunding UI in 2020 to get funds from miners / community


[06/30/2020 8:26 PM] kushti#0978
is Bibox really good these days though?


[06/30/2020 8:27 PM] mx#5165
i am looking and only advantage could be if they are regulated for this price, otherwise not much difference from Tokok


[06/30/2020 8:36 PM] mx#5165
looks like they have blokchain license in Switzerland not financial license but some solid founders there, maybe we could be part of this https://bibox.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011535533--Report-Bibox-Launches-BiboxLab-the-One-Stop-Solution-for-the-Best-Blockchain-Projects

MXC cut down listing price to 5 BTC


[07/01/2020 10:42 AM] morphic#4133
Crazy idea probably, but what if we announce something like "We are actively looking for top 10 exchange listings. The first exchange that lists Ergo will get XXX ERGs grant from Ergo Foundation".  
This is something the foundation can do. 
I assume we only need one of them to solve liquidity problem.


[07/01/2020 11:05 AM] mx#5165
sounds good to me but listing and market makers don`t go in pair usually unless market maker requests that listing


[07/01/2020 11:08 AM] mx#5165
with some grant to partners such ann would have better boost i guess


[07/01/2020 1:06 PM] kushti#0978
Bibox: 2 btc + 4 btc worth of Ergs


[07/01/2020 1:07 PM] kushti#0978
@morphic @mx I'm fond of being more public about all that BS exchanges listings are about

we're not active and transparent enough


[07/01/2020 6:06 PM] mx#5165
being public about all that BS exchanges listings is easy but tether market makers use mostly unregulated exchanges and rather all of them, switching volume from to another from time to time


[07/01/2020 6:11 PM] mx#5165
if i was to vote for 6 btc for Bibox i would rather vote for grant for a partner who potentially can talk directly with top 10 exchanges


[07/01/2020 6:27 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ @Dmitry Meshkov what do you guys think about Bibox offer ? ^


[07/01/2020 6:45 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
My first impression - not bad. It's comparable to the price we paid to probit /p2pb2b/hotbit while in my personal ranking it is better. Not a first-tier exchange, but better than any exchange we have


[07/02/2020 12:41 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Bibox is too expensive. They're not even a top exchange as far as I can tell. Better to spend much more to list on just one top tier exchange than bleeding out funds here and there to list on several non-top tier exchanges.


[07/02/2020 12:47 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
According to Joel Coach K (in Telegram), we could get listed on Kucoin for around US$300K equivalent (this price of course before they know anything about Ergo Platform or any negotiations), includes market making.


[07/02/2020 6:28 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Is kucoin so much better than bibox? $300k vs $50k is a big difference


[07/02/2020 6:37 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Btw I guess there is still an option to list in HitBTC for 50BTC (that was the price at launch time, may be much lower now) , but imho it's a crazy price


[07/02/2020 6:46 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Imho CMC ranking https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/ is pretty fine now. Bibox #16, kucoin #18, hitbtc #20. Better than our exchanges, but still far from binance, coinbase, huobi, kraken.... ,

[07/02/2020 12:38 PM] kushti#0978
@Dmitry Meshkov that's the only exchange asking for that, and totally crappy one


[07/02/2020 12:39 PM] kushti#0978
I think one more listing is needed now


[07/02/2020 12:40 PM] kushti#0978
also, with pools coming we can try to do community-driven MM with HummingBot like ZCoin did


[07/02/2020 12:42 PM] kushti#0978
on a listing, we need it for Cardanians jumping into actively (not only them are coming though)


[07/02/2020 12:43 PM] kushti#0978
It seems they are mostly non-Asians, so an Asian exchange won't change much likely

being it big or small one


[07/02/2020 12:52 PM] kushti#0978
but currently most offers are from Chinese exchanges, best ones are CoinEx, MXC, BiBox

@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ @Justin1000 can you guys please connect with CoinEx ? wechat ID:1157847787 , Make sure he's not a scammer. 

I currently propose 1 btc + 2btc in ergs, or 3 btc in ergs to MXC / BiBox, lets' try to do the same w. CoinEx ?


[07/02/2020 1:04 PM] kushti#0978
BiBox is standing on 2 btc + 4 btc in ergs


[07/02/2020 4:35 PM] kushti#0978
MXC: 2 btc +3btc of ergo


[07/02/2020 6:14 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
@kushti might be useful to have a list of non-asian exchanges. Can you somehow find, what are the exchanges Cardanians use?


[07/02/2020 6:47 PM] kushti#0978
@Dmitry Meshkov I'm not proficient in trading, also, busy with other things. What can I do is to ask people in the groups

[07/02/2020 7:55 PM] kushti#0978
MXC is Chinese exchange, seems to be good tier 1.5-2


[07/02/2020 8:00 PM] kushti#0978
Looks better than BiBox actually


[07/02/2020 8:16 PM] mx#5165
we were comparing it to cointiger as far i remember which was rejected at similar price, i would start with tokok but would ask about mm there


[07/02/2020 8:19 PM] mx#5165
volume in any of them can jump to 1 billion any day so i think we should treat them at old price 2-3 btc

[07/03/2020 4:01 AM] Justin1000#9555
> @Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ @Dmitry Meshkov what do you guys think about Bibox offer ? ^
@kushti If it was 9 months ago, answer would be an emphatic YES! BUT I don't know what has happened with that exchange over past 12 months in terms of volume, popularity, security, ease of use etc. I don't know if BTI live is kept up to date but seems exchange landscape has changed with more concentration in a few top names (mainly binance). So i think someone needs to do some research on 1) any negative news past 12 months; 2) twitter/social media trends for Bibox past 12 months; 3) any indication of there of their financial health and profitability; 4) does exchange work well for deposits, withdrawals and is stable?;  5) any indication of real volume rankings or if they have lost a lot of ground lately


[07/03/2020 4:01 AM] Justin1000#9555
The fee offer for Bibox is quite reasonable but no point in paying such an amount if its not an exchange and obvious step above the ones listed on already.


[07/03/2020 4:01 AM] Justin1000#9555
BIBOX was a TOP target before right below gate.io


[07/03/2020 4:09 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ agreed to look into Bibox current situation. I've put him into touch on a group chat on wechat with Taylor Zhang, who I understand is their head of intnl business and listings. we need to find out about points above. if they are really a big step above our current listings, then I think the pricing is reasonable. They were top target before...(listed other PoW coins early, seemed to have stable good easy to use platform, were top 10-15 on BTI live in real volume, I think multiple language etc)


[07/03/2020 4:12 AM] Justin1000#9555
MXC - never heard of them. not sure if any exchange could have built a good competitive platform in past 12 months since we did all that research and be a better option than bibox at same price? Sounds odd but wouldn't rule it out completely. anyway i think first thing is to find out about Bibox.


[07/03/2020 4:13 AM] Justin1000#9555
Kucoin - way too expensive of course. screw them if that is the pricing. if the pricing is same as bibox probably good idea subject to some research.

[07/03/2020 7:39 AM] Justin1000#9555
I'm asking my BitFinex friend straight out. Maybe he will tell me some inside info on the exchanges. I'm out of date now - seems landscape has changed a lot!! he said would sit down with his team and I could meet up with him week of July 13th.He just got back to hK and is out of quarantine. I guess some chance they might still list Ergo but again better not have any expectations based on experience so far.


[07/03/2020 7:40 AM] Justin1000#9555
But i'm worried we are going to waste money and time listing on some shit exchange. Lets make the next one count. Like p2p and some of those others were shit. Better than nothing at time but we don't need more like those now.


[07/03/2020 7:42 AM] Justin1000#9555
FTX is new exchange in HK. Guess could see if can talk to them. Finex friend just said could try them. I dunno if any good though...

[07/03/2020 12:54 PM] kushti#0978
The biggest challenge we have, and exchanges is just a part of it, is about starting getting more organic trading.


[07/03/2020 2:15 PM] Justin1000#9555
Coinex? Dunno anything  about them. Almost all the reported volume on CMC is fake.


[07/03/2020 2:15 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yes we were targeting gate.io and bibox cuz they listed pow coins like raven early before binance and they had REAL volume. Gate.io at least still does


[07/04/2020 9:29 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Technically Bibox looks pretty solid - they have websocket API, quite a lot of libraries on Github (and trading bots also), trading fees are pretty small.


[07/06/2020 9:55 AM] kushti#0978

@Justin1000 on Bitfinex and gate.io, let's try to get some sort of partnership , not just listing


[07/07/2020 10:29 PM] kushti#0978
for example, SERO claims partnership w. gate.io

Coinex API looks pretty good, similar to Bibox. They have WS support, a lot of libraries and example trading bots on github.
But looks like quite a lot of wash trading there, that is pretty easy to determine. E.g. https://www.coinex.com/exchange?currency=bch&dest=zec&tab=limit pair report $1.3M volume, but its spread is ~1% I've watched it for few minutes and only saw wash trades in between of best sell and best buy.

CoinEx - The Global Digital Coin Exchange. Supports BTC, LTC, ETH, XRP etc and more trading pairs.  High-speed matching engine. Full-dimension Protection. 100% Reserves. Fast Deposit & Withdrawal. Asset and trading security guaranteed.


[07/09/2020 12:34 PM] kushti#0978
@Dmitry Meshkov HotBit also has quite a lot of wash trading, in first months of Ergo trading it was 99% about whitewashing. Currently orderbooks, deposits and withdrawals look good (in last two days ~56.3K withdrawn, change address holds 358K, orderbook looks much better than 1 month ago even)

So I think we need to fulfill community needs and not be worried about washtrading much.


[07/09/2020 12:40 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 @mx @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ @Dmitry Meshkov had a talk with a guy working w. exchanges closely he says that MXC is doing well, Tier 2 exchange going to be Tier 1, and listing price is 10-15 BTC usually.


[07/09/2020 12:41 PM] kushti#0978
So let's proceed with both?


[07/09/2020 12:41 PM] kushti#0978
A bit risky spending, but then listing needs would be closed for 2-3 months.


[07/09/2020 12:41 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 can you ask gate.io guy on how to get into votings?


[07/09/2020 12:47 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
I still think that Hotbit is a quite crappy exchangeüòÜ  CoinEx and Bibox looks much better


[07/09/2020 12:49 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
MXC, CoinEx and Bibox look pretty similar. CoinEx was chosen by the community and as far as I see is the cheapest one - so looks like the best choice


[07/09/2020 12:59 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
MXC also has a huge wash trading volume, IMHO slightly worse than CoinEx. It's up to you, but I'd propose to list on CoinEx only and try to get a 100% good exchange


[07/09/2020 1:02 PM] kushti#0978
@Dmitry Meshkov all Chinese exchanges are doing whitewashing ) sometimes extremely stupid (GJ, Citex), sometimes looking more or less okay. The worse thing, based on whitewashed volume they're doing listing fee business.


[07/09/2020 1:04 PM] kushti#0978
That's why it would be good to get on TradeOgre - no whitewashing, free listing, PoW coins, involved community. Not so many exchanges like TO these days unfortunately.


[07/09/2020 2:55 PM] kushti#0978
Got in touch with Bithumb.Global CEO


[07/09/2020 3:50 PM] mx#5165
I am fine with Coinex, eventually if you can negotiate 4 BTC that would be also good for MXC or Bibox, listings are the best marketing we can have now


[07/09/2020 6:19 PM] kushti#0978
Bithumb Global: 8 BTC


[07/09/2020 8:44 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Isn't it a tier 1 exchange?


[07/10/2020 2:20 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I see two problems potentially major problems with Bibox that I think should be resolved before proceeding with ERG listing

First, Bibox's Estonia company licenses just expired.
https://mtr.mkm.ee/taotluse_tulemus/515198
https://mtr.mkm.ee/taotluse_tulemus/515211

And second, a class action lawsuit was filed against Bibox  in New York on 3 April 2020 for selling unregistered ICO tokens.

Bithumb Global is blocked in mainland China.


[07/10/2020 5:22 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Bithumb Global is not the same as Bithumb, so it might be incorrect to assume Bithumb Global has same or similar volume as Bithumb.


[07/10/2020 5:24 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Would ERG listing on Bithumb Global include listing on Bithumb (the Korean platform that was ranked #3 on bti.live)


[07/10/2020 8:28 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
CMC rank Bithumb as #5, Bithumb Global as #30, so according to them Bithumb Global is roughly the same as CoinEx(#33), MCX(#26) and Bibox(#15), and all of them are better than exchanges, we have now). For sure this ranking is not 100% source of truth, but for these exchanges, it looks quite correlated with other rankings and my personal ranking)


[07/10/2020 8:31 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
@kushti can you please summarize somehow current prices and listing budget? E.g. do we consider 8 BTC listing on Bithumb at all, and does listing on CoinEx excludes the ability to be listed in Bitbumb?


[07/10/2020 8:41 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Coinmarketcap (CMC) "still lists numerous scam exchanges in its Top-10 ‚ÄúAdjusted Volume‚Äù rankings. Its Top-10 list includes LBank, BW.com, Bit-Z, Coinbene, and OEX, which our data is shows wash trading rates at high levels from 96.9% up to 99.7%. This continues to be because CMC ranks exchanges by trading volume without any basic checks, which motivates trading platforms to report false data and rank higher, thus becoming more visible to users."

MXC: 2 BTC + 3 BTC in ergs
BiBox: 2 BTC + 4 BTC in ergs
Bithumb Global: 8 BTC

@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ CMC volume is still inaccurate, but their ranking (this one https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/) based on web traffic, liquidity and volume is pretty good. E.g. the top 5 there is Binance, Coinbase, Huobi, Kraken, Bithumb that are not scam exchanges (and are mostly ranked high in BTI)

I think the email we do all the highlights in summary from and also highlight listing opportunity as well as partnership and development opportunities. as you may know Bitfinex does tons of its own innovative development (Tether being biggest example) like tether, dexes, some new thing with payments and streaming he just told me about and other stuff.

Well, 1-4 should be satisfied pretty easily with the bot you have. I'd probably need some time to pass KYC and integrate, but it looks pretty straightforward.
5 - depends on the self-trading and so on requirements. If they don't provide a commission-free account, we should pay fees by ourselves, for about 0,002 BTC per day if we'll use their token to reduce fees.

@kushti Not sure. Would have to know more. Questions/Concerns include 1) does anyone actually use it? only 19k followers on twitter and its ranked like #50 on CMC link by Dmitry above; 2) Does it have good secure interface that might make it more and more popular going forward (I guess it should be good as it shoudl be as good as whatever they got in Korea); 3) Is there a track to listing on Bithumb Korea? Bithumb official has 193k followers on twitter for example and Bithumb Korea is ranked #5 on that CMC ranking; 4) Are they going to do anything for promotion? Do they have any other interest besides just making some quick money on listing fee?


[07/15/2020 12:58 PM] Justin1000#9555
2 BTC + 4 BTC in Ergs is  a lot for just a #50 exchange if that is all that is getting.

[07/15/2020 3:56 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Side idea - it might make sense to list on Coinex first (as far as I understood it is quite set?) and wait for some time - if this listing will be successful, the liquidity may improve making ergo more interesting for top exchange, and the price may grow up. Both points will make further listings cheaper (if pay in ERG)


[07/15/2020 11:32 PM] Justin1000#9555
> @Justin1000 proposed marketing activities list, numbers are not real
@kushti I took a quick look at Bithumb again. I suppose that:
-Bithumb Global is open to everyone including Koreans but is focused on intnl markets (doesn‚Äôt offer Won)
-Is looking to compete with exchange like Binance ‚Äì already 100+ trading pairs
-I‚Äôm ASSUMING is good tech because it should be using similar tech and capabilities as Bithumb which I ASSUME is good given how successful the exchange has been
-BUT the exchange is still small with limited users. I‚Äôm doubtful this will change in absence of a bull market unless they do something really innovative
-So it‚Äôs a great name but getting listed on Bithumb Global won‚Äôt necessarily provide a lot of new traders and without the marketing support of the platform as a whole, the marketing benefits might not be much either
-Understand on the airdrops etc. Guess is pretty standard. I can‚Äôt say whether its worth it to list there or not. For that cost I‚Äôm a little doubtful. But regardless, should push them for details on 1) Will they give Ergo a path to listing on Bithumb Korea in future with no additional fees (maybe regulatory issues?)?; 2) Will they market Ergo aggressively across their ENTIRE PLATFORM including things like Bithumb official twitter with 200k followers, Bithumb AMA to ALL Bithumb users, including those using Bithumb Korea etc?


[07/15/2020 11:36 PM] Justin1000#9555

@Dmitry Meshkov This makes sense to me especially if listing on Bithumb Global can be done a little later regardless and they won't change terms. In that case, listing on Bithumb Global is free option can exercise a little later. Focus on Coinex first and see if get some results could be good way to go. Maybe still at least keep dialogue going with Bithumb and see if can get them to commit to more marketing and possible path to main Bithumb Korea listing.

Hm, took a deeper look at CoinEx - does not look so good now.
Libraries I found don't work well, and a signature scheme based on MD5 (https://github.com/coinexcom/coinex_exchange_api/wiki/012security_authorization#use-32-bit-md5-algorithm-signature) is quite suspicious for me...

[07/16/2020 9:30 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Do you think the 32 bit MD5 signature  reflects 1) incompetence and or stupidity, or 2)  deception with possible intent to scam?


[07/16/2020 9:42 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Incompetence mainly:
1. It is actually 16-bytes rather than 32-bits
2. MD5 is regarded as insecure for at least 15 years
3. Technically it's not even e signature


[07/16/2020 10:04 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
And not an encryption scheme like mentioned in the next sentence "Use MD5 algorithm to encrypt the signature string,"...

I suspect Coinex got a lot among Persian community


[07/16/2020 10:43 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
We should probably satisfy our community and list on Coinex. Can we wait a few more days? I'd like to finally integrate with it and ensure, that MM bots will work fine there.


[07/16/2020 10:45 AM] kushti#0978
@Dmitry Meshkov few more days for what? We'll pay after integration. Integration already started as claimed my Coinex


[07/16/2020 10:46 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652

@kushti I think the only way to be sure is to send an email to CoinEx, the email address that CoinEx gives on its website. And get them to reply from that email address that yes, Darren (or whoever) with WeChat ID XXXX is a representative employee.


[07/16/2020 11:33 AM] kushti#0978
I sent to bd@coinex.com but no reply


[07/16/2020 11:34 AM] kushti#0978
maybe it is outbound-only box though


[07/16/2020 11:41 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Did your contact sent you an email from @coinex.com address?


[07/16/2020 11:42 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
I recently had a conversation with the scummer who proposed me okex listing, he send me an email from @okex.us.com email, so be careful


[07/16/2020 12:20 PM] kushti#0978
yes, see that domain, and couple of others


[07/16/2020 12:20 PM] kushti#0978
in this case domain was coinex.com


[07/16/2020 12:20 PM] kushti#0978
but personal box


[07/16/2020 12:21 PM] kushti#0978
also, if guys are not so good about security, maybe SPF records not there or can be compromised


[07/16/2020 12:21 PM] kushti#0978
then still you can send from coinex.com and mail service will not give a warning

[07/16/2020 7:06 PM] kushti#0978
so it seems Tier 1 exchanges are about a circle jerk


[07/16/2020 7:06 PM] kushti#0978
you need to get on one somehow to get on others


[07/17/2020 7:34 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Listed for free, or for $1.5M?)


[07/17/2020 7:37 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Bithimb global might be a step to tier 1 exchanges, e.g. When applying to Bittrex (global) next time we can show that we're already on Bithumb) But I agree, that Bithumb global is quite small, whereas Bithumb Korea is quite specific, so we won't get a lot of liquidity in ERG/BTC or ERG/USDT pair from Bithumb anyway.


[07/17/2020 8:05 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
> I went to visit CoinEx office today.  Joint office operation with ViaBTC mining pool, part of  same "econsystem". Seems legit. Office located in Bao An district here in Shenzhen in Â£πÊñπ‰∏≠ÂøÉTowerB, an upscale  mixed use commercial/office building not far from the airport. Darren (the guy who @kushti  introduced to me via WeChat) came downstairs to meet me. Went up to their office, which took up half of a full floor. Darren introduced me to a woman named Barney. Brief tour. Then they took me to the office of Haipo Yang, the CEO. Chatted for about ~20 minutes.


[07/17/2020 8:06 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
So seems we can conclude that Darren is a legit representative of CoinEx.

[07/17/2020 8:09 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Haipo seemed to not know anything about Ergo (not surprising). He asked if it was a PoW coin, and then Darren commented that Ergo is ASIIC resistant, so at least Darren knows something about Ergo.


[07/17/2020 8:12 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I did most of the talking. The CEO Haipo just listened most of the time. I told them we hope to not just list but hope to for partnership of sorts, hope they can help promote Ergo and also build on top. Which is why we also like for an exchange to take payment in Ergs.


[07/17/2020 8:15 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
The one thing that seemed off was that when I first met Barney, I asked her about the CEO's background and she said that he used to work at tech giant Tencent. Then when I met the CEO I asked "so you used to work at Tencent?" and he looked like "huh?" and Barney quickly chimed in that that is what she told me and he said "oh, yeah".


[07/17/2020 8:16 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
But anyhow even if that is bullshit I suppose it shouldn't matter.

@Dmitry Meshkov listing is not guaranteed, especially for free, that's how to read it I guess. For 1.5M Ergo will be listed for sure, but Binance would be cheaper even.

@Dmitry Meshkov Yeah, also, Binance guy suggested to get on something bigger before reaching them again.


[07/17/2020 9:31 AM] kushti#0978
not Binance DEX guy


[07/17/2020 9:32 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652

[07/17/2020 2:34 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
I was finally able to make a trade/get status/cancel order via API from CoinEx (which took quite a lot of time, as far as their Java lib only covers part of the API and some methods in it don't work), but to be honest I have more and more concerns about it.
Besides security concerns I already mentioned, I don't see real liquidity and trades there...


[07/17/2020 2:35 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
E.g. Waves pairs there are filled with very small size orders in all seen interval (which is ~10%)

But at least they use  HMAC SHA256üòÜ
And they have real liquidity for top pairs, and I've heard about this exchange earlier, so it might be a better choice than CoinEx.


[07/17/2020 2:45 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
> BTCNext: free <- are we going there ?
They are pretty new (launched in 2019) and probably won't provide any value right now, but might be useful in the future. Why not if it's free?)
Also looks like they have quite a lot of Twitter followers https://twitter.com/BTCNEXT_io


[07/17/2020 2:52 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
But all CoinEx/BG/DigiFinex looks better than what we have now.


[07/17/2020 2:55 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
BTW while there is no a lot of liquidity on Probit, someone is accumulating there, so it still provides some value


[07/17/2020 3:38 PM] kushti#0978
so maybe Coinex + Digifinex + BTCNext + Atomars then ? )


[07/17/2020 3:38 PM] kushti#0978
and then another round of bargaining

BTCNext + Atomars are free?

[07/17/2020 6:26 PM] kushti#0978
BTCNext are for free, we can give a bit for promo campaigns


[07/17/2020 6:26 PM] kushti#0978
Atomars is almost free


[07/17/2020 6:26 PM] kushti#0978
we can do Coinex + BTCNext + Atomars

Bitfinex proposed call for Thursday (in email). So please have a think about what want to emphasize on the call! Some new ideas they maybe haven‚Äôt heard before that can only be done on Ergo would be best. The times proposed were ‚Äú11.30am or 5.30am‚Äù on Thursday -> guess we should assume is London time and confirm in response. Are @kushti @Dmitry Meshkov  available those times? What time do you prefer? Me and @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ can join.

Partnership ‚Äì Quick Brainstorming of Possibilities from me: 
-Dazaar ‚Äì Can you take a look at this most recent initiative? Anything Ergo can be used for with this to make it better? The most obvious thing is can Ergo simply use it now‚Ä¶maybe do a pod cast or interview or something on Dazaar? Can propose that in the call. As a just recently launched platform, might be good for both Ergo and Dazaar to generate publicity. Perhaps Bitfinex would appreciate it. Dazar Launch

-Tether ‚Äì Might be the easiest one but also least exciting. I guess it is easy to put on Ergo, right? But what additional advantages could be had? I think they already are on multiple platforms including ETH and OMG (https://twitter.com/bitfinex/status/1267421929142661125?s=20) and Algorand (https://twitter.com/bitfinex/status/1248632859071598592?s=20)

-DeFi ‚Äì This might be an area of focus. What can Ergo do here with Bitfinex especially with the new stuff DeFi stuff people are adding to Ergo (Robert‚Äôs oracles?). I might be missing it but I googled and looked around on blog and twitter briefly and can‚Äôt see any major DeFi stuff Bitfinex is doing now.

DEX ‚Äì Bitfinex is huge into Dexes. Launched ETHFinex and EOSFinex (https://ethereumworldnews.com/crypto-exchange-bitfinex-eos-based-dex/). Ethfinex now known as DeversiFi and spun off (https://www.coindesk.com/bitfinex-spin-out-funds-private-dex). Uses zk-STARK and provides privacy apparently but trades executed off-chain. Can you look at what Bitfinex is doing on the DEX front and how Bitfinex can 1) do something innovative; 2) make money;  3) not cannibalize existing exchange or DEX initiative by building a DEX on Ergo? I think Ergo can offer some advantages versus the Dexes built on Ethereum and EOS!

-RingX ‚Äì Surprisingly they listed this tiny market cap RingX (https://twitter.com/bitfinex/status/1271046746089689088?s=20). Can you take a quick look and see if might be something RingX can use Ergo for? Not sure how advanced the project is but maybe they could use LETS?

-LETS ‚Äì Any applications for Bitfinex here? Something brand new that they can do that is both innovative and potentially profitable?

-Custody ‚Äì Ergo can‚Äôt help with custody right? They announced this recently on that front: https://www.hedgeweek.com/2020/06/22/286773/institutional-calibre-custody-solutions-and-connectivity

-Leo ‚Äì Guess nothing to do here for Ergo but a reminder Bitfinex launched its own massive Exchange token to fund the Tether gap from the stolen funds. You can look into it if think something might be doable. Was listed on Hybrid IDEX: https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2019/07/149340-hybrid-decentralized-exchange-idex-delists-bitfinexs-leo-token/

-Anything Ergo is already the indisputed #1 in Tech that can be applied today and used by Bitfinex? Maybe the recent work on Oracles from Robert or something else? Can bring to their attention and highlight how might be useful for Bitfinex.

Consideration:
-Conflicts with Emurgo ‚Äì I don‚Äôt recall any constraints on what Ergo can do with other partners as a result of the Emurgo partnership so everything should be open with Bitfinex but correct me if wrong.
-Lack of Legal Foundation ‚Äì Was mentioned by my friend as a potential issue. Think just say the cost involved and time is great and as platform with decentralized focus is not a priority, just going with virtual foundation, tokens amount that goes to foundation written into code anyway, is transparent as possible, not having legal foundation hasn‚Äôt been obstacle to-date and was able to sign the Emurgo partnership and numerous listing without such foundation.
-Don‚Äôt Bash EOS or other Projects or focus too much on listing itself ‚Äì Just stay focused on what Ergo can do for Bitfinex in terms of partnerships. I think no need to talk about listing so much as that will be natural by-product of a good partnership.

@Justin1000 oracle pools PoC implementation will be released in August , we're already discussing algo stablecoin design. Let's see what can we do with Tether / Finex guys.


[07/21/2020 11:17 AM] kushti#0978
About the time, I'm flexible.


[07/21/2020 12:27 PM] Justin1000#9555
Well hope you have some good ideas for them. If nothing compelling, may miss an opportunity and who knows when will be able to talk to them again - at least want to try and keep dialogue going so need to get them at least a little interested.


[07/21/2020 3:52 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
In terms of USDT directly -looks like they already have a super fast and cheap way to transfer USDT over the Tron network, and a more resilient way to do it over ETH/Omni. But Ergo probably can be useful here in regards to complex scripts support, so it's DeFi again (while it's cool to have USDT support in Ergo).
About DeFi - I'm not in contact with a team that has an interesting concept to issue complex (put/call/ironfly or anything else ) options, that might be pretty interesting (and maybe done pretty easy on top of Ergo) and looks like Bitfinex is behind the rest in derivatives markets, so something like this may fit pretty well.

@Dmitry Meshkov Yeah, I had same thought that maybe USDT special use case on Ergo could be for DeFi but wasn't sure. Yes, derivs sounds interesting too. Something along these lines could be way to go. I think need to try and grab their imagination and have some interesting ideas they haven't heard before that demonstrate the power of Ergo. Specifics can be sorted out later.

Looks like they are hosting token on many blockchains without any interoperability, maybe there could be some bridge done with different POW chain, above mixing Tether and trustless gateways for DEX


[07/21/2020 9:06 PM] kushti#0978
Maybe it would be better to avoid talking about mixing the Tether heh


[07/21/2020 9:14 PM] mx#5165
As last resort i think, eventually someone else will propose it in time, too many smart guys there to not notice some main properties of Ergo

Don't know if your familiar with weather derivs - basically a form of insurance where the farmer whoever with weather risk buys a deriv contract and then gets paid out based on what happens (how much rainfall, average temperatures etc). My Dad's friend who I have known all my life is one of pioneers in space and sold his business (eWeatherRisk) to Arbol recently. They were started 2 years ago by Harvard guy who also ex-Citadel.

So I can do a call with the Founder first just to get more info. But before I do that...this is a possible partnership opportunity right? Ethereum is a joke as well know. So I'm wondering if in the future it might be possible for the Ergo Oracle to take in weather data in a maximum trustless way and generate a payout in a stablecoin but the stuff I see so far for Ergo Oracles is crypto price/defi related and not weather info. Maybe possible? Any other ideas?


[07/23/2020 12:00 AM] Justin1000#9555
They raised US$2mm in funding. I just found out they are already talking to another platform so now could be a good time to talk to them. I can either do a call first or if you think its worth it can just arrange a joint call with @kushti @Dmitry Meshkov joining. Whatever you think. The reason bringing this up is my Dad is asking me...

@kushti Sid Jha at Arbol already responded "Thanks for reaching out. Ergo looks like an interesting complement for what we do.  I have cc‚Äôd our CTO, Ben, and it might be worth having a joint call next week between our firms. " -> guess this means he wants to do a call with you, me and a guy from Emurgo if you can get them on. I responded at put you on the email. Maybe you want to propose some times next week and see if someone from Emurgo wants to join? Sid is in Eastern UST so I think that means 4 PM, 5 PM or 6 PM Moscow time could all work.

Just those things above 1) Arbol Market Website: https://www.arbolmarket.com/; 2) Arbol Market‚Äôs Paper from 2018 - https://www.arbolmarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ARBOL_WP-1.pdf 
For general stuff on Weather Derivatives (most people don‚Äôt know much about them):
Wikipedia on Weather Derivs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_derivative
A research paper on Weather Derivs I googled: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275532497_Weather_derivatives
Think most important thing by far is #2 above (the arbol paper) ‚Äì seems like a decent paper and although it is dated, shows what they are planning to do in general.

They are apparently going to be data mining on all the thousands of weather sensors across US and eventually world and I guess that will be the data input to the oracle which will determine the smart contract payout. Thats my guess. Will start out just US but could go international later. Brian (my dad's friend) was like the first guy in the space in the 90s and headed up Swiss Res weather business for 12 years and apparently sold his latest company to these guys...

Interesting...regarding Chainlink...for the CMC description it specifically says: "Oracles provide external data **(e.g. temperature, weather)** that trigger smart contract executions upon the fulfillment of predefined conditions." -> So its a near certainty that Arbol has at least been talking to Chainlink. Please keep this in mind when thinking how to approach Arbol with Emurgo.

@kushti it starts from the last price, buying if the price goes down, selling if the price goes up


[07/29/2020 12:19 AM] kushti#0978
@Dmitry Meshkov does not  make any sense, any way to reset the bot ?


[07/29/2020 8:32 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Sorry, I read you message incorrectly - bit starts at CMC price, when you start it, after that he use its last price. 
It, buys with lower price when it goes down, sell with higher price when it goes up. You just can stop/start it, and it will use current CMC price. But in such a case you'll effectively sell some ERGs - if the price will go up back to 3k, you'll have less ERG and more BTC than you had earlier.

That is only 200 so 999,800 left.


[07/30/2020 3:18 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Yup. It's a start!


[07/30/2020 3:19 AM] Justin1000#9555
In event of a vote, Emurgo, Ergo, Charles Hoskinson and Sasha should pump hard to get people to vote. Probably need to offer at least 100k Ergs as airdrop. Should win but worst case lose, will still be good for promotion.


[07/30/2020 3:25 AM] Justin1000#9555
oh...just twitter followers alone...Solana has 81k. Maybe harder than I think to win such a vote.


[07/30/2020 3:25 AM] Justin1000#9555
Well Emurgo alone ha 75k. And Ergo already 8k. And if you can bring 1 million from China should be good.


[07/30/2020 4:43 AM] Justin1000#9555
Charles 125k, Sasha 100k. If these guys all help then 1) our chances of getting in are quite high; 2) Gate.io's chance of letting us try to win a vote is higher too.

SERO is similar to Ergo in some aspects, PoW, extended UTXO model, better privacy


[07/31/2020 9:50 AM] kushti#0978
KuCoin: $150K normally, but they're considering discounts


[07/31/2020 9:51 AM] kushti#0978
There's also possibility to get via voting, but we need to be considered as "DeFi project" by their due dilligence team for that


[07/31/2020 9:51 AM] kushti#0978
"For supporting the potential DeFi projects, KuCoin introduces the newest listing program, especially only for DeFi projects. So there are two options for listing right now, and the fee structure is below:
1. Normal listing: The standard listing fee will be $150,000+$50,000 in the worth of native tokens for the marketing campaign
2. new community vote: $20,000 USDT(Participation Fees) + $50,000 worth in native tokens for community reward pool + marketing campaigns.

Compare with the normal listing, community vote is much more attractive and it is definitely an easier way for startup/potential project to get listed in the Tier 1 exchange!"


[07/31/2020 10:48 AM] Justin1000#9555
Why not shift all focus on ergo marketing and development to defi right now? There is a craze underway. Isn't that the fastest way to get users and exchanges? And cant ergo do a lot or everything these other projects are doing?


[07/31/2020 2:58 PM] kushti#0978
the same opinion raised in ergonauts TG group (Noah is there)


[07/31/2020 2:58 PM] kushti#0978
Yes, DeFi is hot, and Ergo is about DeFi before the term was coined even


[07/31/2020 3:24 PM] kushti#0978
@Dmitry Meshkov do you have price fetching modules for the exchanges ?


[07/31/2020 3:24 PM] kushti#0978
Could be useful for the oracle pools demo Ergo and Emurgo are doing


[07/31/2020 7:05 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Well, it easy to get order book, slightly more difficult to get a single number of the price from it, especially for small liquidity pairs.


[07/31/2020 7:06 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
There is also an option to get an accumulated price from CMC (I guess Coigeco and others also have API), this prices might be more useful


[08/01/2020 7:01 PM] kushti#0978
CMC price is now unintentionally manipulated by the Citex


[08/02/2020 3:51 AM] Justin1000#9555
Seems like entering another big bull market because of DeFi and global situation. Ivan on Tech going crazy talking about DeFi - he thinks important to interoperate with Ethereum because it can't handle the work load and important to list on Uniswap (but don't try to claim to be "Ethereum Killer"). Maybe Emurgo's development on Ergo will result in a clear and new DeFi use case for Ergo - that would be great. Also I read Huobi is big into Defi and invested into DForce. OKEX is probably doing something too.


[08/02/2020 8:23 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 OKEX and Huobi have investment arms ?


[08/02/2020 8:23 PM] kushti#0978
Maybe it would be good to have some joint project with one of them + Emurgo (+EF)


[08/03/2020 2:17 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I think it would be good if someone (not me!) could think of a proposal for a specific DeFi use case to develop with each of Emurgo, Huobi and OkEx.


[08/03/2020 2:26 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
"Ivan on Tech going crazy talking about DeFi - he thinks important to interoperate with Ethereum because it can't handle the work load and important to list on Uniswap (but don't try to claim to be "Ethereum Killer")."

Maybe now would be a good time to do a paid promotion piece with Ivan on Tech? Especially if he can promote (or at least suggest the possibility of) Ergo as an alternative to Ethereum.

And in general, maybe now would be a good time to promote Ergo as the more secure DeFi platform alternative to Ethereum.


[08/03/2020 10:23 AM] kushti#0978
Yes, good time for that.


[08/03/2020 10:23 AM] kushti#0978
Also, let's coordinate marketing efforts with Emurgo


[08/03/2020 10:23 AM] kushti#0978
some joint releases and announcements in August


[08/03/2020 1:18 PM] Justin1000#9555
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ He said better not to promote new token as Ethereum killer/alternative but rather as complementary or interoperable as I mentioned above. But up to the team to decide best strategy - that is just what I heard Ivan say in his video. Yeah, seems could be good time to do interview with him or something if price is okay. But need to think about how fits into broader promotion strategy- best if done around some marketing efforts/joint announcements with Emurgo etc that @kushti mentions


[08/03/2020 8:13 PM] kushti#0978
We can do an interview with better guys than Ivan "lets-make-a-deal" On-Tech

Digifinex 2 BTC, maybe partly in ergs


[08/12/2020 11:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
Great. Sounds hopeful. Not sure which one is better between Gate.io or KuCoin. Ideally list on both. Then we would really be ready to go to a top 5. But got to see what they offer.


[08/12/2020 11:33 AM] Justin1000#9555
Digifinex, not so sure about. Back a year ago when did research I was thinking they were mid-tier at best. And there were some scam accusations. But that was a year ago and they are ranked #21 on CMC right now. So could be pretty good.


[08/12/2020 11:34 AM] Justin1000#9555
Indodax I think is a solid small exchange based on previous research. BUT its local Indonesia as far as I recall. So I think they are not priority right now. I recommend staying friendly with them then coming back and listing there on good terms once we have gotten on some bigger global exchanges. Then can build Indo community as well.


[08/13/2020 2:04 AM] Justin1000#9555
I listened to an interview with CZ of Binance yesterday done by Michael (Boxmining guy based in HK). CZ said they are keen on DeFi and don't see it as competition but mutually beneficial. And they really only have one metric when comes to listing coins and that is number of users and their requirements had not changed. He doesn't get involved in listing decisions himself but said they had recently been listing 4-5 coins a week and even listed 2 on one day.


[08/13/2020 10:12 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 our guy in DEX is not responsive now. Then Gleb is the best contact we have, from the last call (in June), we need to get on another tier1 exchange and then Binance will consider us (Gleb may help, but again, listing on another tier1 exchange is needed)


[08/13/2020 10:36 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Any progress with gate.io? If they are in China maybe I can offer to  go meet them if that might help?


[08/13/2020 11:58 AM] kushti#0978
They're considering what to offer us )


[08/13/2020 11:59 AM] kushti#0978
The same about KuCoin

{Reactions}
üëç 

[08/13/2020 1:00 PM] Justin1000#9555
Could be worth paying up for the first tier 1 exchange. If we can have some confidence that can get us the users and also get the price to $1 or higher. Even at $1, the Foundation then has enough money to get another and maybe another top listing and promotion and so on resolving a lot of issues. So lets wait and see what Gate.io and Kucoin say. And if its a choice between them, lets choose carefully!


[08/13/2020 1:01 PM] Justin1000#9555
Higher price more secure network, better partnership opportunities as well and so on too. It will be like a snowball! And finally Ergo will get the recognition it deserves!


[08/13/2020 3:02 PM] Robert K#0722
In between Gate.io/Kucoin, from my arbitrary personal experience I preferred Kucoin, though I haven't looked at the numbers for the two for which actually looks better on paper.


[08/13/2020 3:06 PM] Robert K#0722
One thing I would recommend, is that before we agree to pay for any listings/make announcements, we need to provide new users a simple way to get off the exchanges and into a wallet, as now it's a bit hard to do so. 

Optimally this would be with Yoroi, but we've been a bit backlogged with IOHK changing everything 10 times with the Shelly upgrade in Cardano last-minute, and so pretty much everything is broken in the Cardano ecosystem, and that included Yoroi until a couple days ago. That said, most fires should be put out soon, and hopefully if nothing crazy happens within the next month we should be able to release it.


[08/13/2020 3:06 PM] Robert K#0722
(And we'll get working on Yoroi mobile support as well in the mean time)


[08/13/2020 9:37 PM] kushti#0978
oh that's nice


[08/13/2020 9:38 PM] kushti#0978
So let's wait for listing prices


[08/13/2020 9:38 PM] kushti#0978
I'm pushing as hard as possible


[08/13/2020 9:38 PM] kushti#0978
To get the best price


[08/18/2020 8:02 AM] kushti#0978
Trying to get a discount from KuCoin, it seems voting season is over, and regular listing fee is like 150-200K.


[08/18/2020 8:02 AM] kushti#0978
"How about you give us a proposal which included your budget, the mutual benefit between us so on?"


[08/18/2020 8:02 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 you have some draft for that, right ?


[08/19/2020 12:17 AM] Justin1000#9555
> @Justin1000 you have some draft for that, right ?
@kushti No. Just emails and the old thing to Bitfinex from Dec2018 which is too dated now. But I think I have time today to write up something. @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ as appendix, I think we should attach links to latest news (Emurgo partnership/DeFi blog post etc) and quotes from people like Charless Hoskinson/Sasha and others. I think you have most of this. I don't think it should exceed one page in word - maybe you can put that together real quick.

[08/19/2020 2:55 PM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti Attached above is word and pdf versions of what we drafted. I tried to make a narrative around Ergo adding value to Kucoin...one way is through its survivability and adding diversity to what DeFi stuff they have already. put a lot of emphasis on DeFi.


[08/19/2020 2:56 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 thanks, will take a look soon!


[08/19/2020 2:56 PM] Justin1000#9555
the core is offer of 100,000 ERGs...worth about $65k now though


[08/19/2020 2:56 PM] kushti#0978
oh okay


[08/19/2020 2:56 PM] Justin1000#9555
and how they will benefit from listing Ergo


[08/19/2020 2:56 PM] kushti#0978
I though to push them to accept 50K USDT


[08/19/2020 2:56 PM] kushti#0978
let's see


[08/19/2020 2:58 PM] Justin1000#9555
well I don't know how your negotiations have gone. but there is a big gap between 50k and the 150-200k claimed regular listing fee. The logic to a flat 100k Ergs is that they then get all the upside when it trades up and their interests are aligned. So the 100k is actually more than $65k if assume is going to trade up.


[08/19/2020 2:59 PM] Justin1000#9555
Easily changeable though if you want to propose $50k USDT instead. need to just change in the proposal section and also just not imply they get any upside when it lists (that is implied in current version)


[08/19/2020 3:07 PM] Justin1000#9555
actually only need to change is this part: "The Ergo Foundation will pay 100,000 ERGs from..."


[08/19/2020 4:16 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 let's send the same text to Bittrex ?


[08/19/2020 5:30 PM] Justin1000#9555
well, just need to make a few changes to take out the Kucoin-specific stuff. but that should be easy.


[08/19/2020 11:24 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 Looks nice, will send in my morning!


[08/20/2020 1:18 AM] Justin1000#9555
Okay, good...praying that we finally break through to a Tier 1 exchange soon!


[08/20/2020 1:19 AM] Justin1000#9555
if you want to submit it to Gate.io or Bittrex or some other top exchange, can let us know and we can edit slighty to make appropriate version for that exchange (should be quick).

[08/20/2020 3:27 AM] Justin1000#9555
I told Brian not surprised they were using Chainlink for now at least because it was built on Ethereum and is more readily usable at moment. But in long-run there could be survability and scalability issues and it could be good idea to revisit Ergo later once the tools are built out more. So lets keep in mind and potentially re-approach Arbol in 6-12 months or whatever.


[08/20/2020 10:22 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 during the call with Arbol we agreed to catch up few months after


[08/20/2020 10:23 AM] kushti#0978
Kucoin: "will update it to the compliance team but just kindly reminding that normally the standarad listing fee is around 150-200k, so I am afraid that the team may politely decline this offer."


[08/20/2020 10:23 AM] kushti#0978

[08/20/2020 10:23 AM] kushti#0978
I'm pushing gate.io that time


[08/20/2020 10:49 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti maybe i'm missing something but these exchanges seem stupid. Don't they realize that once they list Ergo and market it, the price of those 100k Ergs will pretty quick be above that and it has huge long term potential? I don't get it. anyway, can  just keep pushing...has to be just a matter of time.

[08/20/2020 2:00 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Probably information is not getting to the right people, just grunts.  Or (more likely) the right people are burned out after in 2017 getting proposals from hundreds and hundreds of shit coins. They might be lazy or just think it makes better business sense to just get as much from listing fees and not "waste" time evaluating coins beyond minimum acceptable standards. "Speculating" on coin potential may just not be a part of the business model, they expect investors to do that and so good coins would have enough investor money to pay large exchange fees.... and any coin that can't afford hundreds of thousands or million plus in USDT must be lousy since no  big investment behind it. Who knows.


[08/20/2020 2:00 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
But anyhow we keep pushing and hopefully we find someone with a brain.


[08/20/2020 2:53 PM] kushti#0978
Well, from my experience I think @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ is right, exchange managers (mostly just checking whether a "blockchain project" they consider passing buzzwords Bingo) usually consider that all the projects these days have ICO / VC millions.


[08/20/2020 2:53 PM] kushti#0978
It is hard to get through the system, but I guess we can do Tier-1 listing soon.


[08/20/2020 2:53 PM] kushti#0978
Lemme update Bittrex again.

@kushti PDF and Word of Bittrex attached.


[08/21/2020 4:40 AM] Justin1000#9555
Bittrex looks great! Top 10 on bit.live, approaching 1 million twitter followers. Can we make a big push? Can Sasha help or is his relationship stale at this point? I recall bittrex was like first exchange to list waves in 2016 or whenever.


[08/21/2020 4:41 AM] Justin1000#9555
At this point, I'd be willing to even support upping the offer to 150,000 ERGs for the first top exchange like Bittrex. BUT ONLY if going to make difference. We shouldn't negotiate against ourselves obviously but if we think the exchange would require that and go for it, we should probably do it.


[08/21/2020 4:44 AM] Justin1000#9555
I don't like paying so much but the rationale would be the first big exchange will get the user base and price up, thereafter, we wouldn't need to pay so much. People on telegram begging for proper exchange. Given Ergo's quality I think it will benefit more from just one top exchange then all these crap tokens do. Not enough people have looked at Ergo yet...once they do its going to be exciting.


[08/21/2020 10:15 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 thanks! will update Bittrex. On gate.io, our conversation is not very formal still, but seems they're pretty friendly. Will start pushing them in few days


[08/25/2020 8:42 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ @mx good news, gate.io is willing to list Ergo, asking for $50-100K airdrop in Ergs for their users

That's great!


[08/25/2020 8:51 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
ERG/BTC and ERG/USDT?


[08/25/2020 8:52 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti OMG...almost thought the day would never come after all that time chasing these exchanges! Hmmm US$50-100k though. But no exchange fees? I think if no exchange fees and is airdrop to users, we can accept paying a little more. Afterall, airdrop gets into hands of traders and hopefully gets em excited!


[08/25/2020 8:57 AM] Justin1000#9555
Right now Erg price on HotBit, Tidex is about 53 cents or so. So 100k Ergs at that price is $50k. But also, I would anticipate news of a listing on Gate.io while maybe not quite as great as Kucoin or Bittrex should still boost the price a lot. Hence I'm not sure how many Ergs we ultimately need to give. 100k Ergs still seems like a good base-case assumption though. If Erg price doesn't move at all, then 100k ERGS is $50k. If it doubles on the news, then its $100k.


[08/25/2020 8:59 AM] Justin1000#9555
ideally we don't make a decision right now on number of Ergs but agree to airdrop $50-100k in Ergs to Gate.io users and get the listing process started. Then lets see how the price goes before we announce the airdrop number (preferably after announcement of listing on Gate.io). Price change unpredictable. maybe it doesn't move that much or maybe it even goes well above $1 pre-airdrop announcement in which case, we should consider saving the treasury some funds and doing less than 100k Ergs.


[08/25/2020 9:15 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ Gate.io #10 on BTi.live for real volume. $43 million! a little above Bittrex which is #11. Lets make the most of this!

@Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ on this Fri the Ergo price will likely go up because of the oracle pools release, so we can send an offer just after this

{Reactions}
üëç 

[08/25/2020 9:25 AM] kushti#0978
or even slightly before, as there's some gap anyway


[08/25/2020 1:52 PM] Robert K#0722
Sounds good. I think it makes sense to send the offer right after the release of oracle pools so that the price hopefully appreciates.


[08/25/2020 3:35 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ @Robert K @morphic @mx alright, so let's have a vote on the forum for approving 100K to gate.io ?


[08/25/2020 6:14 PM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti maybe we should have a vote to approve **UP TO** 100k Ergs to Gate.io at your discretion. That way if price were to move up dramatically soon  then you can finalize the number at a little less than 100k so we don't overpay. But yeah, 100k to get listed on first big exchange is well worth it in my opinion so I think can move ahead with vote.


[08/25/2020 9:42 PM] Robert K#0722
If we could wait on voting for this listing, we had good discussions with IOHK today and and Charles himself said he wanted to help with getting Ergo on Binance.


[08/25/2020 9:59 PM] Robert K#0722
Emurgo & IOHK are going to see what the chances are for listing via Binance for a similar prine range.


[08/25/2020 10:02 PM] mx#5165
In standard way they requested other tier1 exchange first, but it is also possible to get there through community votings, in case of Binance users giveaway, there could be bigger amount of Ergs considered


[08/25/2020 10:04 PM] mx#5165
Most probably lots of exchanges would contact by themselves next or just would list Ergo by themselves


[08/25/2020 10:35 PM] kushti#0978
Last time Binance guy suggested to get on another Tier1 exchange yes


[08/25/2020 10:38 PM] Robert K#0722
I was told Charles knows CZ personally so that likely will be a difference.


[08/25/2020 10:39 PM] Robert K#0722
I'm fine either way, but I'm just letting you guys know this new piece of information, and that it might be valuable to spend said funds on Binance if we can get that instead now that Charles himself mentioned that he may push to get Ergo listed.


[08/25/2020 10:39 PM] Robert K#0722
(How much Ergs do we have currently unlocked btw?)


[08/25/2020 10:41 PM] kushti#0978
@Robert K need to obtain precise numbers, but I guess can be about 300-400K


[08/25/2020 10:42 PM] kushti#0978
With ~5K being unlocked daily


[08/25/2020 10:42 PM] kushti#0978
Btw still 60K to be paid for CoinEx listing


[08/25/2020 10:43 PM] kushti#0978
(2 BTC back then , I paid from my personal ergs, to speed the things  up )


[08/25/2020 10:45 PM] Robert K#0722
And in terms of total locked funds yet to be unlocked, how much will we have availalbe? (Would be good to know to scope out future spendings of what is realistic)


[08/25/2020 10:49 PM] mx#5165
You mean total treasury left to be unlocked in next 18 months? https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/addresses/4L1ktFSzm3SH1UioDuUf5hyaraHird4D2dEACwQ1qHGjSKtA6KaNvSzRCZXZGf9jkfNAEC1SrYaZmCuvb2BKiXk5zW9xuvrXFT7FdNe2KqbymiZvo5UQLAm5jQY8ZBRhTZ4AFtZa1UF5nd4aofwPiL7YkJuyiL5hDHMZL1ZnyL746tHmRYMjAhCgE7d698dRhkdSeVy

[08/26/2020 9:28 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Robert K That is super exciting to hear Charles pushing Binance for us!! Binance has always been our #1 target. I definitely think we should list there ASAP and it is in Binance‚Äôs interest as well.


[08/26/2020 9:28 AM] Justin1000#9555
But I also think we should list on Gate.io ASAP too. They have always been among our very top exchange targets back mid last year when first started researching exchanges. And we have applied multiple times over past 1 years and finally they said yes to our latest proposal which I believe we gave them a full doc on. So I think we should move forward with them and not do anything to risk missing the chance. We need to be listed on a few of the top 10 anyway.


[08/26/2020 9:29 AM] Justin1000#9555
So I think we should list on both ASAP. Then maybe take a break from exchanges for a ~2 months while the team focuses on other things and our Foundation coffers replenish but at hopefully higher price levels.


[08/26/2020 9:29 AM] Justin1000#9555
So in summary, I suggest 1) proceeding with Gate.io; 2) pushing hard and proceeding with Binance ASAP too.  The only caveat is that if Binance doesn‚Äôt like us listing at Gate at about the same time then we should have a conversation with them about that. But hard to imagine they really care. Especially as they list coins that list on other exchanges all the time. Also, not sure when we‚Äôll hear back a definitive answer on Binance. Don‚Äôt want to miss chance or delay with Gate.io.

Agree with @Justin1000 , we lost 2 months on OKEX , so better not to rely on a single exchange, even Binance

Thanks @mx.


[08/26/2020 2:02 PM] Robert K#0722
That's a fair analysis @Justin1000, and 100k won't set us back as much as I initially expected, so makes sense.

@kushti We need to deal with this at some point. So the Foundation owes you 60,000 ERG for the CoinEx Listing? Do we have enough funds to pay you back now and cover other expenses? Lets think about it. Paying you back earlier is ideal. Or maybe 1/2 now and 1/2 in 30 days or something.


[08/31/2020 6:42 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652

@mx Yes, saw comment. My Bitfinex friend mentioned them to me a while back. And I checked before with someone else...was doing about US$5mm a day in real volume. Not bad for new exchange. Backed by Alameda guy. But he was also backing some dex building on that Solano chain. Anyway, listing there should be good if they want to and are reasonable.


[09/02/2020 2:45 AM] Justin1000#9555
asking around for contact. i would know them already as based in HK but hasn't been meetups here for a long time due to virus


[09/02/2020 3:02 AM] Justin1000#9555
GATE.IO: So i looked at voting precedents. From brief review seems that they have 3 types: 1) single listing voting - people just vote on whether to list a single token or not; 2) 2 tokens competition - people vote on 2 tokens and both are listed but one is listed a day earlier; 3) 2 tokens competition - only the winner with most votes is listed


[09/02/2020 3:02 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think that (2) and (3) maybe same and they just decide afterward based on response which one to list. but not sure.


[09/02/2020 3:04 AM] Justin1000#9555
They use the gate.io token to vote. no idea how many people in our community hold that. i would guess not too many but impossible to say. for me based on what little I know, seems like 50-50 chance whether we are successful or not. But should try hard anyway of course. Worst case is we get the word out to more people and its good advertising although obviously not winning a lot of support from the gate.io token holders won't look good


[09/02/2020 3:07 AM] Justin1000#9555
> KuCoin: "I am afraid it will be around 150k but partly amount could be paid by your native token."
@kushti Disgusts me to say it but we may need to pay this ridiculous fee and do it ASAP. I don't know how vote with Gate.io will go. And this exchange problem has been outstanding for SOOOOO long. Taking so much time from you and others. Also, Kucoin on CMC at least claims to be one of biggest traders of ADA -> means SYNERGIES we need right now. People are dying for good exchange. Its great the price has gone up so much just with Hotbit/Probit/Tidex but not sure its sustainable. Maybe we should move now and take Kucoin while price is up to keep momentum so we can easily afford other exchanges in future. Maybe they will take 100k of fee in Erg. Remainder in USDT so we don't have to sell too many Ergs ourselves in market.


[09/02/2020 3:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
Given the heavy marketing to Cardano community for Ergo right now and the apparent prominence of ADA on Kucoin (CMC says >10x volume of ADA on Gate.io), we probably gain more from listing on Kucoin than Gate.io right now. Obviously listing on both is the goal but I'm just trying to say it probably does make sense to pay this crazy fee in this instance given all that is going on.


[09/02/2020 3:21 AM] Justin1000#9555
What do others think on Kucoin? $150k. Should we move ASAP to seize this and insure momentum is sustained? If the decision yes...then guess we should move ASAP. Before price might decline. We have a lot of market risk right now!


[09/02/2020 3:40 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I totally agree. We should take advantage of the current market and Ergo momentum and go ahead and list on Kucoin even at $150K.


[09/02/2020 1:15 PM] kushti#0978
Ok I'm pushing KuCoin manager then to finalize the offer


[09/02/2020 1:16 PM] kushti#0978
Continue talks with gate.io, I've sent them an integration guide


[09/02/2020 7:33 PM] mx#5165
I think we should  go for Kucoin also, good timing and listing prices increased a lot in the meantime, now they will be probably growing even faster

[09/04/2020 3:07 AM] Justin1000#9555
On Aug 11, seems Gate.io changed listing vote rules so both projects get listed. And you  don't vote with Gate Token it seems but pay USDT to buy gate token which is then burned and get paid airdrop based on proportion. Hopefully that is how it works now, in which case listing should be in the bag.


[09/04/2020 3:37 AM] Justin1000#9555

@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ @Justin1000 @mx ^ listing proposal from KuCoin


[09/04/2020 1:09 PM] Justin1000#9555
If I am reading that correctly, it is saying US$170k Dollars + US$160k worth of ERGs would need to be spent. Only $50k USD and $50k worth of ERGs would ultimately be recoverable after used for market making.


[09/04/2020 1:10 PM] Justin1000#9555
So totally unaffordable for us. Only way could consider it is if post Gate.io and hopefully good market conditions and good news flow, ERG price goes up more.


[09/04/2020 1:14 PM] Justin1000#9555
also, its not what they said either. this states clearly listing fee of US$180k + listing campaign costs of US$50k so US$230k total and way above the $150k they told you.


[09/04/2020 3:19 PM] kushti#0978
listing campaign is optional


[09/04/2020 3:19 PM] kushti#0978
on MM, we can earn on it


[09/04/2020 3:19 PM] kushti#0978
but also can loose


[09/04/2020 3:19 PM] kushti#0978
Also, we can't do it atm.


[09/04/2020 3:20 PM] kushti#0978
We need to hire some guys to do MM


[09/04/2020 9:04 PM] mx#5165
5) Other supports from Ergo:
1. Ergo will help to attract the at least 500 new registers and traders from the community to KuCoin exchange with the daily trading volume between $300,000 to $400,000.

1) Listing fee: $120,000 + $60,000 worth of ERG tokens

4) Trading fee discount for your Market Making accounts in KuCoin: 0 for maker order and 0.06% for taker order


[09/04/2020 9:04 PM] mx#5165
so that`s more or less proposal for our voting


[09/04/2020 9:06 PM] mx#5165
looks like we need to wait till we can do mm or someone else is willing to do it


[09/04/2020 10:40 PM] mx#5165
i guess it would have more sense to have own proposal for own mm on for example gate with some amount not wondering if we can earn or lose on it


[09/04/2020 10:43 PM] mx#5165
if it is as trusted as people claim, they should easily follow volume there


[09/04/2020 11:09 PM] kushti#0978
but who will do MM ?


[09/04/2020 11:09 PM] kushti#0978
we can find performers


[09/04/2020 11:09 PM] kushti#0978
they charge something though


[09/04/2020 11:14 PM] mx#5165
sure, fee for solid service is fine


[09/04/2020 11:15 PM] mx#5165
or grant


[09/05/2020 8:20 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
We need to specify MM requirements first, they might be very different.


[09/05/2020 8:24 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
I now have MM status on Exmo, Okex and Huobi , they all have very different requirements. And the fact that I'm capable to satisfy their conditions doesn't mean that I'll be able to do it for Ergo MM program


[09/05/2020 8:28 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Also usually exchanges rebate makers with negative fee rates, not a fixed grant. This opens some MM strategies and encourages to have higher volume


[09/06/2020 8:50 PM] kushti#0978
btcnext.io will start ERG/BTC and ERG/USDT trading on Mon , they did it for free but would be happy to get some ergs for an airdrop (like 5K)


[09/06/2020 8:51 PM] kushti#0978
would be good to get attraction for gate.io voting maybe


[09/07/2020 8:50 AM] kushti#0978

was wondering where trusted exchange such as gate could potentially list their token, so it is on few exchanges, mostly unknown ones are BiKi, EXX, HBTC, maybe worth to be examined


[09/08/2020 11:32 AM] mx#5165
coingecko shows additionally AEX, Hoo, ZG.top


[09/08/2020 3:12 PM] kushti#0978
@mx all are Chinese I guess, Biki and Hoo are doing more or less well from what I know


[09/08/2020 3:12 PM] kushti#0978
GT is also listed on gate.io )


[09/08/2020 4:12 PM] mx#5165

not sure if true and hopefully if is, it is not huge problem...but rumor is gate.io got raided in China. can just keep an eye out for any more news on it...hope your integration discussions are still proceeding...


[09/10/2020 5:47 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 last discussion was yesterday, they said integration is going and listing vote date can be set when integration ETA will be clear, as listing will be in like 2 days after the votign

maybe police will buy ergs, good lesson included to not list any garbage out there

[09/10/2020 7:50 PM] mx#5165
rather police won`t buy anything, looks like customer support in China


[09/10/2020 10:03 PM] kushti#0978
Indeed, in the long-term those exchanges will be more careful about what do they list hopefully


[09/11/2020 12:18 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti probably this isn't a big deal...Molly on twitter saying it was just customer service office. Also, its not a shocker for local police to make a move on an office if they get complaints from people. Local govts in China very sensitive to maintaining local order and moving early on problems to avoid bigger problems later


[09/11/2020 12:19 AM] Justin1000#9555
This is Zhongshan, a city in Guangdong not far from HK...kinda doubt main operations are there.


[09/11/2020 12:19 AM] Justin1000#9555
on telegram Chinese channel, Gate.io is saying all operations normal


[09/11/2020 12:21 AM] Justin1000#9555
GT token barely moved...just down 2.4% vs USD


[09/11/2020 12:22 AM] Justin1000#9555
so still don't know all facts and i don't see official clarification announcement but i'm cautiously optimistic at moment


[09/11/2020 12:23 AM] Justin1000#9555
if do ask em about it, pls be positive and polite...hope its no issue and they can get the integration done asap...then hope there is some positive news to get momentum going again...broader crypto market seems to have stabilized

@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ I dont know what he was talking about or if it is just nonsense. U can ask him if u want.

Xenomia is saying in Telegram we need marketing. He says Ivan and Chico reviews pumped UBT 50x just on Hotbit. And pumped EWT 10x. @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ is this true? If you don't know can we get 1-2 pages analysis done?


[09/12/2020 10:28 AM] Justin1000#9555
with detailed look at precedents and trading performance post the reviews. 2 pages probably at least. and what exchanges the various tokens were listed on


[09/12/2020 10:30 AM] Justin1000#9555
I'm not comfortable sitting around waiting on Gate.io given all the setbacks with exchanges. To me it seems "pump and dump" is perfectly fine if we get 5 days with the price 10x higher than today with decent volume. we can then sell Ergs from treasury and get USDT to pay listing fees for Kucoin and maybe 1 other exchange. they are basically ready to go anyway.


[09/12/2020 10:30 AM] Justin1000#9555
not sure will be a dump at all and if there is one it might not last long!


[09/12/2020 10:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
i'm not proposing this. I'm Proposing we RESEARCH it and CONSIDER it @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ . Then decide. There is some decent ideas being floated in our telegram chat from community we need to explore


[09/12/2020 10:33 AM] Justin1000#9555
Ideal scenario is we just list on Gate.io + positive news flow on the great development work going on regarding Emurgo/Ergo and others + more users and then price just goes higher then we can afford Kucoin and maybe others. But seems we should at least be considering other ideas thrown out there by the community if they may make some sense especially when Gate.io hasn't listed yet.


[09/12/2020 11:23 AM] Justin1000#9555
I was talking with Martin Bauman of CMCC.VC last night and went to his place for drinks (you can check their website if you like). He is co-founder. do early stage investments and have millions under management. just sent him email and highlights. he told me last night he would have his more technical partner Charlie have a look at Ergo. Think its good if they might get involved as we could use more stakeholders. also the current valuation meets their requirements for "VC" investments so I am thinking they will at least have a look. Told them could arrange a call if they have some positive feedback and ideas of how to work together.


[09/12/2020 11:26 AM] Justin1000#9555

[09/13/2020 4:24 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
@Justin1000 I'll try to research it on Monday, hopefully wont be busy at work. Yeah would be great for the Ergo ecosystem to get a 10x or even 5x price pop, then swap some ERg for enough USDT for big listing.


[09/13/2020 4:49 AM] Justin1000#9555
just emailed cypherpunk holdings again after >1 year. They are great potential investor for Ergo given their focus on privacy, great connects and now we have the liquidity in the secondary they can just pick up tokens without having to get them from foundation.


[09/13/2020 4:50 AM] Justin1000#9555
also email Tidebit. They probably got some connects. I met them again Friday night and the marketing director was really curious about Ergo so lets see if he comes back with any ideas.

@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ We need 1) have fact-based analysis of ideas coming from various parties, especially community telegram chat. these should be in the form of ~2 page research papers. That way we can make informed decisions. None of us like the idea of going out to shills like Ivan on Tech and stuff but if it works it works...we need to at least form an informed view; 2) Update list of all KOLs ranked by tiers with commentary; 3) Updated exchange list. But we just need top 15-20 target exchange...not the 100s from before. any we haven't contacted or have not contacted in long time we should try and see if way; 4) list of possible investors - good to add stakeholders...they can buy the tokens themselves now given secondary liquidity and we don't have to sell from treasury...then they will be highly incentivized to help us get on exchanges, promote, get price up etc.

Gate still doing new listings! We are soooooo ready! Hope they hurry


[09/14/2020 2:20 PM] Justin1000#9555
We should look to focus marketing efforts around Gate.io listing. Videos, postings, KOLS if needed. I suspect we need to get the price up to $2-4 area for a week so we can sell Foundation ERGs for USDT to raise enough money to pay for 1) Kucoin listing; 2) market maker. Then when we have break-throughs and positive news, it will have a positive effect on the price instead of being ignored thus giving us more funds for more development, promotion listings etc -> positive feedback loop. So lets try and take advantage of this Gate.io listing to form a solid foundation for future!

@kushti Okay, think lets do it! And then Kucoin and then Binance ASAP. Gate.io still seems to be proceeding with votes. Just announced listing of Pha 3 hours ago. Last 24 hours they are #11 on bti.live with $44mm volume.


[09/15/2020 11:39 AM] Justin1000#9555
hope next step is Kucoin...Hotbit doesn't trade ADA at all. Gate.io does only $50k a day volume in Ada. But Kucoin think many more Cardano guys we can mesh with. Just gotta get the price up a bit so we can raise the money to list there. Hope Gate.io listing can do it for us...

In regards to this one specifically, my initial takeaways are that:
*Hard to separate out noise and come to firm conclusion on exactly what KOL benefits we can get
*But there is strong evidence, they can be value add (just look at the % returns in the Chico table)
*Ivan on Tech: results not impressive. But Trust Swap stands out as similar to Ergo situation given was Hotbit/Probit -> Ivan on Tech Video -> Gate.io and +307% in 1 week and 237% in 2 weeks. This is EXACTLY the result we want.


[09/17/2020 10:12 AM] Justin1000#9555
*Chico: Very strong % returns post his coverage. Table is pretty compelling. Noah also did case study on $UBT. Seems he does comprehensive type pump strategy. Also, note many of these projects are still way above his initial video levels. Not just pump and dumps it seems.
*Last page shows how we can benefit tremendously if this works out. If we can boost price by 50%, then potentially $125k more for exchange listing/MM expenses; by 100% then $250k more‚Ä¶easily enough for Kucoin + MM expenses I believe and if 300% then would have up to $1mm in discretionary funds to be used for listings, promotion etc.
*Goal/Strategy: We are NOT looking for a ‚Äúpump and dump‚Äù here. We are looking to get the price up for at least a 1-2 week period giving PRICE/TIME/LIQUIDITY to monetize enough ERGs for USDT to guarantee we have the funds to get listed on some proper exchanges and do proper marketing for the medium term. The expectation would be the momentum would carry us through and price probably just go higher from there. But as the Foundation resources depends so heavily on the price this may be a potential solution to our long-standing exchange and marketing issues.
At least it seems to me to be a component of such strategy! Curious of others prelim views though based on reading this.


[09/17/2020 10:12 AM] Justin1000#9555
Next steps:
-@noah can put together the full updated KOL list. We can‚Äôt analyze each KOL in the detail of this EFAM of course but I think just by doing this EFAM on these 2 guys, we are in a better position to quickly assess other KOLs. 
-Then we contact all relevant ones with Ergo highlights and see what they think and if they will cover Ergo for free or how much they cost. We tried this exercise 1+ year ago with mixed results but now tons more to talk about with 24mm ERGS outstanding, Emurgo partnership and tons of other positives
-@noah to continue following up with Chico
-For Ivan on Tech, decide later. I‚Äôm thinking we check his latest thoughts on Ergo at right time. And see if he will do for free or tell him we did detailed analysis and don‚Äôt think we can justify $13k based on past precedents, offer him $5k or something‚Ä¶anyway decide that later


[09/17/2020 10:26 AM] mx#5165
Chico looks more effective but i wouldn`t expect specific % returns, either way it is good timing to do such promo event so let's see what the price is and vote on it next


[09/17/2020 10:26 AM] Robert K#0722
This EFAM was very interesting, great work. I do think if we can get Chico, then it'd be a good first test to see if this kind of strategy in fact will provide gains for us.

@mx yeah, me neither on specific % returns. i think we would do it right before or after Gate.io listing if it moves ahead. in meantime we'll chase up all the decent KOLs we can find to try and have someone good ready. Think we're all on the same page...worth a try at least if right KOL/right time/right price.

@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ sorry for the delay, finally, I've got a chance to read the doc carefully, some notes:
* for AMPL, the driving factor probably was about token mechanics (algorithmic supply readjustment)
* from data it is hard to say whether impacts were positive, especially in the long-term

Mentions from KOL would be good in combination with other events I guess. I think to talk with bez in coming days about reviving strategy-based marketing, now it is looking a bit chaotic from EF & Ergo community side


[09/18/2020 9:51 PM] kushti#0978
Ideal storm would be about gate.io + Yoroi + some KOLs spread around 1-2 weeks maybe.

@kushti agreed. That is what me and @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ been discussing. + @Robert K updated oracle pools would be even better. If gate.io doesnt happen we can do it anyway if enough other positive news flow about same time. Hope gate.io comes through though asap.


[09/18/2020 11:01 PM] Justin1000#9555
Working on detailed updated KOLs and updated teaser. Probably ready to start sending teaser out to KOLs Monday. Might take some time to get them teeed up ahead the coordinated effort. Were planning to notify marketing machine at right time

@kushti we need separate MM or @Dmitry Meshkov bots enough?


[09/18/2020 11:10 PM] Justin1000#9555
we need USDT to pay these exchange fees. So need price up plus need to sell some ergs when that happens to then close deals with a couple top exchanges. Plus some more marketing budget


[09/18/2020 11:11 PM] Justin1000#9555
A Binance listing would be great especially post the Yoroi wallet. Maybe they will do it for free cuz huge trading fees they can make


[09/18/2020 11:11 PM] Justin1000#9555
We need more date sources and more reliable ones for the oracle pools too! Most immediately for upcoming stablecoin Emurgo is deploying by year-end.


[09/19/2020 9:56 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Robert K I was doing some thinking on Binance. Being listed there would solve all of our exchange problems in one fell swoop as after that other exchanges would be easy to get listed on in due course and we wouldn‚Äôt need any others in next few months anyway allow @kushti and team to focus on development and stop mucking around with these exchanges and wasting a lot of valuable time. I would note that:


[09/19/2020 9:56 AM] Justin1000#9555
1) We have reached out to Binance for a while now. They told us to wait until we have listed on some other big exchange(s) and then seek listing there. 
2) CZ said clearly and repeatedly in interview I listened too their #1 concern is users in looking at who to list. Frankly, right now Ergo probably still doesn‚Äôt have the number of users that they would normally look for.


[09/19/2020 9:57 AM] Justin1000#9555
But I think Binance should make an exception in Ergo‚Äôs case and list Ergo ASAP. Addressing the Users issue:
1)    We are partnered with Emurgo and will be on the Yoroi wallet soon alongside ADA and complementing Cardano. Binance trading US$40 million in ADA in just the past 24 hours and has huge trader base of ADA users. 
2)    We will do very active promotion around time of Ergo listing on Binance. Can time Yoroi wallet release, Binance listing, new oracle pool release and marketing efforts all to correspond.
3)    So given (1) and (2), there is no way we will not reach the user threshold requirements for Binance


[09/19/2020 9:57 AM] Justin1000#9555
For addressing their first point about first getting listed on exchanges:
1) Probably only said that because they thought it would get us more users and that is taken care of already as mentioned above.
2) They can reap big advantage by being first to list ERG as everyone will be wanting to trade it at this key point. So they can make a lot of extra trading fees and cement themselves as go-to exchange for ERG trading


[09/19/2020 9:57 AM] Justin1000#9555
And to add to their incentives to list Ergo, I think we can do a [30]-day exclusivity agreement (in fact I would be supportive of a 60-day agreement) where the Ergo Foundation would not seek nor facilitate any other exchange listings starting from when firm agreement to list Ergo is reached to [30] days post trading on Binance. This would give Binance a near monopoly on ERG trading a minimum of [30] days and likely longer because if we started conversations on other listings >30 days, well it would take another 10-30 days to actually list. Obviously we can‚Äôt stop exchanges from listing on their own so that is another thing.


[09/19/2020 9:57 AM] Justin1000#9555
So while I think their initial stance on other exchanges and users is reasonable, the Emurgo partnership, the Yoroi wallet release, the work you are doing on pools changes everything and they should list Ergo ASAP. On top of that, we could further offer 100,000 ERGs + exclusivity agreement.

[09/19/2020 9:58 AM] Justin1000#9555
Attached is sensitivity analysis sheet showing fee profits they can make with this strategy. I think its fair to say under these circumstances ERG is going to be trading >$3 or much higher and trading volume will be high as % of total outstanding and that Binance will be dominating that volume by a big margin. So easily can expect trading profits of $150k in 30 days and more likely to be much higher (even $1 million conceivable). You can look at the sheet for more details and the logic.


[09/19/2020 10:02 AM] Justin1000#9555
Even though I think this makes a lot of sense, coming just from us Ergo guys I don't know we can get anywhere. Coming from Emurgo and possibly Charles, however, Binance should get the message.

Had a talk yesterday with a guy who did lot a lot of fundraising in Asia (China, South Korea, Japan) in 2017 and active again now. 

He said that he has connections in OKEX, Huobi, gate.io and can do free listing there even if we can present a compelling DeFi story to them.
Also he said now it is possible to do a big marketing campaign for Chinese market for $40K.
Also, he's interested about getting in into Ergo. 
Let's see how it goes.


[09/21/2020 2:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti did gate.io give a reason why they are not listing ERG? Should ask if haven't. Cant address concerns if dont even know what they are. I don't understand what went wrong as we had already drafted description etc and seemed ready to go


[09/21/2020 2:18 AM] Justin1000#9555

@Justin1000 I'll see what I can do in regards to Binance. I already have to manage several projects, and then try to manage the ebb and flow of inter-company politics to merely mention getting Erg listed on Binance to Charles again to remind him to push for it.


[09/21/2020 9:15 AM] Robert K#0722
In regards to gate.io, I think it's a good lesson we probably shouldn't hype anything until we have more guarantees going forward.


[09/21/2020 9:43 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yes very much agree on not hyping anything from now on after what happend with Gate.io. in fact hyping it or mentioning ahead of time could actually put the whole thing at risk as exchanges may not like that unless they have given explicit permission or announced it themselves. We should all remember this in future.

Yeah getting tokens for funds is hard. I told guys to buy on market if they like it. But liquidity is still low and changes a lot. Some funds simply too lazy or don't trust hotbit/tidex to get on buy there. To he honest to get a significant position it does take a lot if time on those markets.

[09/24/2020 5:35 AM] Justin1000#9555
Since we are doing latter and we dont have money to burn seems we should not use them and get @Dmitry Meshkov bots for Kucoin, Gate and whatever other exchange


[09/24/2020 5:35 AM] Justin1000#9555
He said "MM is for three purposes 1) keep spread tight to encourage trading, 2) price support (if u want to burn cash), 3) drawing a beuaitful chart (if u want to burn cash)"

[09/24/2020 8:26 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti r we getting USDT pair with gate? We (you mainly) need to be ready to monetize foundation ergs for USDT on a price pump to 3 dollars or whatever so we can pay kucoin and potentially raise some excess funds so we are not at mercy of market and erg price. Can do without usdt pair but adds an extra leg cuz got to change the  btc to usdt....

Not much loss on the Hotbit bots after all this time


[09/24/2020 9:16 AM] Justin1000#9555
Anyway I am sceptical we need these MM guys. The liqudiity will build organically as we onboard thousands of users thru news, developments, more listings, etc. I have zero sympathy for these whiners who claim cant accumulate ergs. Definitely can accumulate 200 to 500k usd position on hotbit|tidex if put the work in


[09/24/2020 9:18 AM] Justin1000#9555
Instead of selling foundation tokens on Hotbit or gate.io could look to do an otc sale to 1 solid investor who can bring a lot of value but I would NOT support selling anything  at these prices so they would be buying after a run up. Probably just sell over 5 days on Gate or hotbit to raise the USDT. Dont wanna dump too much on one day but we need that USDT at right price ( I am thinking roughly $3+ if can get there soon)

> @kushti I think this is 100% correct. Thin order books because ERG hodlers know the current market price waaaaaay undervalues ERG so of course they are not selling a lot. Other than miners, I think only a fool would sell large amounts at these low prices, and seems to me these guys  are asking us to be that fool.  If they want nice fat order book and liquidity, fine, let them just wait till ERG is as USD$10 and then they can buy. Or they can put in their big limit order at 5x the last trade and they should get filled pretty quick.


[09/24/2020 11:25 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
My bots potentially can keep low spread and price support, but they need some support and I'm not so active now. They're profitable if the price will go back to the initial level, but may loose money in case of large pump or dump. 
Looks like Hotbit actually do the same, but in a very light mode - they now keep spread of 3% by orders of ~12 ERG size. In such a case losses won't be large for sure, but I'm not sure it really helps a lot.


[09/24/2020 11:49 AM] Justin1000#9555
Maybe somebody else on team can maintain Dmitrys bots on other exchanges. Else we could consider hiring one of those cheap MMs strictly for keeping spread tight. But I am afraid they may do worse job than us and also cost us money.

[09/28/2020 2:22 PM] Justin1000#9555
yeah we did it before. but just in case they need something different.

[09/30/2020 9:39 AM] Justin1000#9555
Today...


[09/30/2020 9:55 AM] Justin1000#9555
Not a mind reader but probably they want to get Erg done before the holiday and that is what they have been working toward...just a guess. Seems good timing in general.


[09/30/2020 10:00 AM] Justin1000#9555
if so though.. I think important to pay ASAP...as long as no red flags...

Exciting stuff! Let see how much this helps us! Could be really big. A proper exchange for people to buy ERGS from FINALLY! People have been dying for this for so long (especially me!) haha. Well lets get set cuz lots of good news coming out over next 1-3 weeks.

I've got Gary doing what he can on translation front but he is getting slammed at work. but we will have most important stuff translated. At some point we really need to vamp up our China marketing. Get it sorted. We got a foundation but still  needs a lot of work.


[10/01/2020 10:51 AM] Justin1000#9555
Anyway lets do "Plan A".  once gate and other news comes out if we get to like $2 or whatever, lets 1) Confirm Kucoin Proposal still good and ask them for a listing date; 2) Sell the ERGS for USDT, list on Kucoin ASAP; 3) Target additional exchanges and promote


[10/01/2020 10:52 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think a lot of ADA users on Kucoin...Huobi and Binance next targets after them.

[10/01/2020 6:02 PM] kushti#0978
but would be good to get on some decent exchange for Westerners, what could be that though ?


[10/01/2020 11:42 PM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti I was getting ready to submit a proposal to kraken via email. I have had my dad chasing up everywhere for contact but no luck so far. If they are reaching out to us that is great! Fck coinbase...their ethos is garbage...kraken much better and lots and ADA trading


[10/01/2020 11:47 PM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti personally not that worried about kucoin hack. They came out right away and said would make everyone whole (I watched live stream of CEO). Not many exchanges if any haven't been hacked at some point. But I havent checked latest news. Maybe it will make listing there cheaper but I wouldn't waste time negotiating a lower price unless you want to check now and see if they can lower price for us and if offer is still good? Hack may even make them more willing to list new projects to show business still operating normally and moving on.

Be sure to mention the ADA yoroi angle and how Kucoin trades lots of ADA, ERG is going on Yoroi and we have lots of users in telegram specifically asking for Kucoin.


[10/01/2020 11:52 PM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti yes huobi should apply immediately. Was going to look into that today. But I wouldnt count on them. Who knows when they will list or how much money they will demand? We already had a firm listing proposal from kucoin! Unless sasha/charles/EMURGO can get something from Huobi, too early to count on them. We been talking about them like 1.5 to 2 years and we still dont have contact I think.


[10/01/2020 11:53 PM] Justin1000#9555
Huobi is top target after binance. All in the memo. But just getting listed, price and timing all unknowns. Should have much higher certainty on those regarding kucoin ! Makes it logical next step unless something on hack is really ugly


[10/01/2020 11:54 PM] Justin1000#9555

Can submit proposal here. same email guy mentioned. So I'll write a proposal a long the lines of what we sent to Gate.io/Kucoin/Bittrex before but leave out the 100,000 ERG offer for now. Just tell them we didn't do any mutli-trillion dollar ICO etc so need to be low cost. I'll also mention the Ethos angle. Email best to come from @ergoplatform (this is why was asking about that earlier) but anyway probably doesn't matter.


[10/02/2020 1:18 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti
I just watched 5 minutes of a 20 minute update from Kucoin CEO on 9/30 and spent 5 minutes scrolling through the telegram. Insurance fund covering everything, deposits/withdrawals returning to normal. We should move ASAP and see if we can get listed there sooner and cheaper because of this rather than wait for price to rise etc. ‚ÄúFree‚Äù is unrealistic and not proper to propose that to them as looks like we are just trying to benefit from their hardship. Maybe we resubmit our 100,000 ERG proposal and show our support. I can rewrite some stuff and we resubmit IMMEDIATELy

And we can tell them we have a market maker (WAVES). Don't need to mention by name but can say its sorted and we are ready to begin integration ASAP. LIsting Ergo one more way to show they are getting back to normal.


[10/02/2020 3:07 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti Updated proposal for KuCoin above.


[10/02/2020 3:07 AM] Justin1000#9555
Highlights:
-we sympathize and support KuCoin and think they will emerge from hack stronger than ever
-we still want to list on KuCoin ASAP and would have agreed already but we don‚Äôt have the excess funding of other projects because we didn‚Äôt let VCs and other insiders come in early with big money
-our ethos is aligned with KuCoin whose motto is ‚ÄúThe People‚Äôs Exchange‚Äù -> our core dev Alex Chepurnoy wrote smart contracts for the people more than 2 years ago. (so they should stop asking us for big fees which could only come from VCs etc but not saying this direct)
-big news coming and developments have proceed very strongly since our last proposal on August 20th 2020
-Users demand KuCoin ‚Äì we‚Äôve heard it over and over again in telegram and KuCoin is big trader of ADA who we will be becoming interoperable with etc
-Updated proposal 
*Listing fee of ERG 100k: same as what we originally proposed but subject to renegotiation should Erg price rise >US$2.00 before they accept the proposal
*Listing Campaign: we don‚Äôt need one and don‚Äôt want to blow the money
*Deposit: Agree to USDT 50k + USD 50k worth of ERGs for MM
*Market Maker: We have one now. Don‚Äôt list by name but Waves can handle it. They are also listed on KuCoin.
*Other support: No promises or commitment on timing/exact numbers from us but we expect in long-run to far exceed their desired requirements.
NOTE: They had a lot of specific requirements in the ‚ÄúOrder Book Maintenance‚Äù / ‚ÄúTrading‚Äù / ‚ÄúPrice‚Äù -> I have not addressed the details of these. I think we need Waves to review these but NO NEED FOR THAT NOW. Lets just get the above headline terms agreed then run those details by WAVES and ask for suggested amendments to those details if needed. Should be a minor issue.


[10/02/2020 3:10 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti Can you submit this ASAP? We don't have time to waste as exchange integration takes time as we saw with Gate. Also, we want to show our support for KuCoin early post the hack. I don't know that any other EF members would take issue with what we are proposing either. The 100k Erg is same exact listing fee in our original proposal. We have a carve out for if ERG goes above $1.80 BEFORE THEY AGREE (180k was their ask for listing fee), then we can renegotiate -> this shows we are confident in ERG price but also protects us from paying them an exorbitant fee if ERG rises fast and then they accept.


[10/02/2020 3:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
DEPOSIT: on the USDT 50k + USD 50k worth of ERGs, we've been aware of that requirement for some time. Unless you were planning to ask for less I was assuming we would agree to that.


[10/02/2020 3:15 AM] Justin1000#9555
@mx @morphic  @Dmitry Meshkov @Robert K @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩanyone else any thoughts? Else i suggest moving ahead ASAP. This hack could actually be an opportunity. The only thing i have any doubts on myself is that deposit amount. Seems steep to be honest but I wouldn't know and had been assuming we would meet that requirement.


[10/02/2020 3:26 AM] Justin1000#9555
I suggest amending the deposit to $20k USDT/ $20K worth of ERG. The original plan was to wait till Erg rises then list on KuCoin. This current attempt is to take advantage of hack and positive developments on Ergo side and list on KuCoin before price rises. But selling $50k of Erg at this price or giving $50k worth of ERG is undesirable. Also, if they push back its one point we might able to give ground on to get something somewhere else.


[10/02/2020 3:26 AM] Justin1000#9555
Any more comments?


[10/02/2020 3:29 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti I'll work on a proposal for Kraken later today. Won't propose any payment to Kraken as we don't know yet they even require it. Will instead emphasie other points and how ethos matches up etc. and then we can see what they ask for on listing fee / MM side.

> @kushti yes huobi should apply immediately. Was going to look into that today. But I wouldnt count on them. Who knows when they will list or how much money they will demand? We already had a firm listing proposal from kucoin! Unless sasha/charles/EMURGO can get something from Huobi, too early to count on them. We been talking about them like 1.5 to 2 years and we still don`t have contact I think.
@Justin1000 I like Houbi very much, IMHO it's the best exchange I use, even better than Binance. Last time when I proposed to apply to Huobi, you were against this idea, I'm glad that you've changed your opinionüòâ 
Sasha has a good connection there (Waves has a high weight for market makers, Huobi has launched Waves futures recently, Waves staking, and so on), so maybe very useful. But the price may be high anyway.
P.S. I'm a quite successful market maker there, if you wish you may refer to my account (catena@protonmail.com) when applying to prove that we're capable to provide enough liquidity.

[10/02/2020 9:03 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Dmitry Meshkov Oh cool. Awesome. Yeah Huobi is top priority now. Can't recall details but think it wasn't a priority then because we had no connect, was pre-EMURGO/Cardano tie-up (they have lots of ADA users) and just didn't seem practical. Anyway, we should apply soon! Gotta check out their app though in more detail...they have online one...maybe new. I have only briefly glanced at it so far. Definitely should refer your account too...

[10/02/2020 9:51 AM] Justin1000#9555
updated KuCoin proposal. Only difference from last version posted is added in the link to the Sep digest made by @mx so they can see how active things are. personally I think should send it out asap if no issues and also the Kraken one later today (I'm doing it now and will upload when done). But I feel given how long it takes and how much can go wrong better to reach out to both same time. For KuCoin we're just taking a shot to see if in the current environment where Ergo has accomplished so much lately and they have had their hack they might list us quicker and cheaper. Also, even if they say no, its good for the future to show our support now. anyway I defer to you guys...I'm going to do a little research on Kraken and write up the proposal real quick and post a little later.

[10/02/2020 11:47 AM] Justin1000#9555
so i put in some stuff about them specifically. History/Ethos; Selectivity (they haven't listed too many coins = GOOD cuz probably means they do more research and not just list all crap so that will work out well for Ergo); DeFi (they listed 3 DeFi tokens a couple weeks ago = shows they want into area but were all Ethereum).


[10/02/2020 11:48 AM] Justin1000#9555
Well if we get on KuCoin + Kraken...then pretty game over as far as exchanges  go i guess. that is 800k twitter followers between them and about 10 million active users although some big overlap may not be as big as other exchanges. With those 2 and that many eyes on Ergo, Binance and Huobi should just be a matter of time.


[10/02/2020 11:49 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti Hopefully good to go but you can have a quick proof read of both the above to see if anything not your liking or got something wrong. Else, please send out to Kraken via official Ergo Email. And to Kucoin however we been talking to them i guess.


[10/02/2020 11:50 AM] Justin1000#9555
btw those @mx digests are really useful. These should be going into Binance via Gleb or some other better source every month.


[10/02/2020 11:51 AM] Justin1000#9555
+ every other exchange we have dialogue with from now on like Bittrex and whoever else.

[10/03/2020 2:32 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti Sounds great. Kraken would be really awesome! I hope they can do it quick! From that email seems they have a detailed process to follow. Our "proposal" that I drafted won't substitute for that I think so will still need to follow their detailed process but maybe its best to send our proposal first because it might make them take us more seriously and highlights some attractive points and shows how much we care. Any suggested changes you want to that let me know and will try to do ASAP. Thanks

[10/04/2020 10:26 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Dmitry Meshkov @kushti here is research did on Huobi back in May last year. I just too another brief look. I think situation a little better now. Below are some brief notes.


[10/04/2020 10:27 AM] Justin1000#9555
1) Need to Apply for **Permission to Apply** before can actually apply! That link is here and think needs to be submitted by someone with account (I have an account). The requirements are as follows: https://www.huobi.com/en-us/application-center/authentication/

{Embed}
https://www.huobi.com/en-us/application-center/authentication/
Permission Application Form - Huobi Global
Complete the permission authentication by filling in the required documents and information.


[10/04/2020 10:27 AM] Justin1000#9555
Required Info Includes:
*Contact info of community contact person
*Token abbreviation
*Company name, place of registration, registration number all OPTIONAL -> Do not need a Company to apply. This seems an improvement versus last year.
*Need 1) Upload of person photo holding ID card and 2) CV of THREE "Key Members" of the Community.
*ALSO, Need 1) Upload of person photo holding ID card and 2) CV of the "CTO" and "CMO".
*OPTIONAL: Bank account of applicant, bank address, bank card number, other bank account details (good is optional)
*Apparently this is ALL that is required for "Permission Application Form" (I guess is Permission to then Apply)
*They also say you need to agree to the Project Presentation and Listing Application Service Agreement but the link to that takes you to the Support Page of Huobi so makes no sense at all

The Requirements for Listing are Vague and Listed as Follows:
¬∑Submitted documents are complete and accurate.
¬∑Fulfill the professionalism and compliance requirements with no policy risks.
¬∑Meet the standards in SMARTChain Blockchain Asset Evaluation.
¬∑Strong team or community maintenance.
¬∑Projects have actual technical support or practical application.
¬∑Disclose project information, including white papers, periodic development and progress reports in a truthful and timely manner.
¬∑Other specified requirements for being listed on Huobi Global.


[10/04/2020 10:28 AM] Justin1000#9555
So BEFORE can even apply to list need those pics with ID from apparently 5 people. But its a lot better than before when their listing requirements seemed to include Company docs and other stuff.


[10/04/2020 10:29 AM] Justin1000#9555
However, seems to me if we have a contact there somehow, much better to talk to them first before submitting a bunch of info. At least we should know our application for "Permission to Apply" is going to be taken seriously and it would be good to know the cost. For example if they want $300k or something than no point in applying now. So I suggest making a contact and finding out more before applying.


[10/04/2020 10:35 AM] Justin1000#9555
As highlighted in the EFAM ($10 by 12/31) another good target is Upbit Korea - seem to trade US$millions / day of ADA. And they have 173 coins listed according to coingecko. So I'll ask a few people if they have a contact there and can help. I recall we already decided Bithumb was way to expensive for now. Maybe Upbit is different. But I don't know that I will be able to find good contact or not.

@Justin1000 I will have a lunch with CBDO of CoinTelegraph on Tue. Hopefully we can get some connections from him.


[10/04/2020 12:03 PM] kushti#0978
Also, lemme ask that guy Maximilian (Russian guy working with Asian funds, exchanges, merketing services) about Huobi and OKEX connections. But he suggested to get on gate.io first and then IMMEDIATELY reach Huobi and OKEX.


[10/04/2020 12:49 PM] Justin1000#9555
-Sounds great on Coin Telegraph CBDO. There coverage could be VERY useful and there is ALOT for them to report on. Ergo should be great source of stories for them given all that is going on and fact it has been under covered for so long! Give them the scoops üôÇ   and get a relationship going!
-Defer to Sasha on KuCoin. I was initially skeptical myself (weren‚Äôt on BTI.live) but so many apparent followers/social media etc. Also, a lot of people in our Telegram were asking for them specifically. 
-Listing for free: Well I hope so too and always did! But if its choice between months of waiting or paying now to get on a given top 10 exchange, I say pay as long it is not too crazy amount. Time is very valuable after all!
-Agree on going after Huobi and OKEX IMMEDIATELY after Gate listing. Hope we can utilize some contacts‚Ä¶I have asked Cliff (the Cardano Ambassador) ‚Äì he says he knows some Huobi guys and is checking. Let you know if find out anything.

@kushti tomorrow after the announcement I suggest you discuss with maximillian. Let me know how you want to chase binance/huobi/okex. My OSL intros to okex/binance should be solid off the back of that gate news but no guarantees so if u think better to go thru maximillian or both osl and him u can tell me.

@kushti is there going to AMA with Gate.io ppl? Seems like a good idea if not planned already. I saw Polkastarter is going to do AMA (they just did listing vote and listed there)

okay now that listing is announced and coming, you can also suggest a telegram or wechat post listing group to cover any ongoing technical issues or marketing/joint promotion stuff we can do then bring in some more people like me and noah and some Ergonauts.

Darn. I should have thot we need some people on gate.io with like 20k USD ready to buy to keep the price falling like this right after start of trading. Looks bad. But too late now. Should just be short term problem. I am actually surprised lasted this long and somebody hasn't bot up that cheap book but oh well.

[10/13/2020 10:26 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ seems to have been contacted by OKEX. Looks like much better platform for what we need right now than Gate.io as they talk a lot about marketing they can do, AMAs etc. This is what we need right now! Since its going to be a little while longer before apps easy to use for normal people we need to build more hype through this type of marketing and in the app @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ got they ask a lot about all the types of marketing we will agree to (think we probably say yes to everything and really emphasize this is exactly what we want and will want to maximize our marketing to OKEX users).

Some things I highlighted in yellow should be reviewed.


[10/14/2020 3:57 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
For "¬∑ÁßÅÂãüÊäïËµÑ‰∫∫/Private investorsÔºö"; Even though it's not really an investor, I wonder if it might be good to mention here the EMURGO partnership?


[10/14/2020 3:58 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
For "Please upload any legal advice that your token is not a Security", I think @kushti and or @Justin1000 has something.


[10/14/2020 4:34 AM] Justin1000#9555
*no Emurgo not investor. Dont think need to list any private investors
*chepurnoy misspelled in contacts 
*add me and you to contact list. Add emails, wechats and telegrams of all 3 of us
*exchanges add tidex. List gate, hotbit, tidex, coinex at top.
*airdrop and exclusive okex launch: I dont know what exclusive means and we haven't decided yet on airdrop. For both put "To be discussed further and agreed with OKEX"
-change to Êàë‰ª¨ in the AMA on info reading
-for legal entity put in front "As a decentralized platform there is not legal entity..."
-for token holders it should be (2). They will have all sorts of opportunities to generate returns using ERG. You should say "numerous opportunities to generate returns" including on upcoming projects built by Emurgo like the stable coin
-ERG holders cant vote ! Should be (3)
-yes largest airdrop was 100k on waves in 2017. Maybe you can find the month. I forgot. It is on bitcoin talk or something


[10/14/2020 4:36 AM] Justin1000#9555
For airdrop let's see how okex responds then we need to discuss amongst ourselves. If they are really serious about marketing to their users and helping us promote I think hard not to do a 25 to 100k airdrop.afterall we did 50k for gate and they didnt do any promotion. A airdrop of some size would probably be mutually beneficial if it really goes to okex users and they are serious about joint promotion.

Nobody, OKEx (Serena) from our Chinese Telgram group sent me a PM yesterday yesterday. Totally unexpected.


[10/14/2020 11:27 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I wouldn't be surprised if all/most of the top exchanges monitor new listings on the other top tier exchanges. Could be that ERG has been triggered now thanks to gate.io.  No idea, just speculating.


[10/14/2020 11:55 AM] kushti#0978
I guess so, they're watching for each other for sure


[10/14/2020 9:35 PM] kushti#0978
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ Is she really from OKEX though?


[10/14/2020 9:35 PM] kushti#0978
Please be careful !


[10/14/2020 9:36 PM] kushti#0978
On Kraken, it seems I was in talks with a patient scammer :

"Hello Ergo team,

Thanks for your interesting in having ERG listed on Kraken. Please find a link to our listing application form here. We are automatically notified after you submit the application, we will reach out to you if we have any follow-up questions or topics for discussion.

You should also know that Darin Zumberi is not an employee at Kraken; you are speaking with somebody posing as a representative of Kraken. Would you be so kind as to provide us with the Telegram conversation you had with them so that we can forward it to our investigation team?

Kind regards,

Robert"

[10/15/2020 2:08 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
> @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ Is she really from OKEX though?
@kushti I am not certain. When she contacted me on Telegram I at first assumed she was a scammer (I always do) but was polite just in case she was legitimate.


[10/15/2020 2:09 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
First surprise was that she could form sentences and communicate properly.


[10/15/2020 2:10 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
What I would normally do is ask her to send me an email from official OKEx email account or some other way to indicate she was legit, but before I could do that, she first asked me for my email so that she could send me the applicaton.


[10/15/2020 2:10 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
She sent me an email which appears to be from @okex.com.  I say appears because I am not a security expert and do not know whether it is possible that it can appear to be from @okex.com but in fact not be.


[10/15/2020 2:11 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
But that email from her, serenawang@okex.com, I also forwarded to you and @Justin1000 on 13 Oct titled "Application from OKEX" and I indicated "Person from Ergo Chinese Telegram contacted me on Telegram claiming to be from OKEx listing. Just sent me this email. No idea if legit or scam.".


[10/15/2020 2:14 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I defer to you as to whether or not she is legitimate. Anything else we should ask her? How else can we confirm whether or not she is from OKEx? Is her email that appears to be from serenawang@okex.com sufficient proof that she has an email account with OKEx or should we have some other proof, and if so what would that be?


[10/15/2020 2:15 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
She said their office is in Beijing and said I could go visit them, so I could also go to visit them in Beijing if things progress.


[10/15/2020 2:19 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
For me, standard operating procedure is to assume they are a scammer but be polite just in case they are not. Get them so send something by email and then I forward that to you and @Justin1000 and you guys can decide if they are scammer or not.


[10/15/2020 2:20 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I don't spend much time chatting with anyone until they send something by email that at least appears to be from official account. Until they do that, I assume they are likely a scammer (of course knowing and actually hoping that my ASSumption might be wrong).


[10/15/2020 3:05 AM] Justin1000#9555
Just submit it to list@okex.com email address on their website! Then tell serena in wechat...in email obviously you have to mention weree contacted by serena wang and to please forward to her...

Waiting Kraken and OKEx improvement. Lets push hard on OKEx as soon as they clear up their withdrawal problems. If they were serious about listing Ergo, they seemed like could be hugely helpful on China marketing side. Would very complementary to our own efforts.


[10/24/2020 12:43 PM] Justin1000#9555
Outside development and other news, through end of November I am now thinking biggest impacts on price will be 1) HF or lack thereof; 2) China marketing success or not; 3) New exchange listings with exchanges that actually help market or do things like AMA etc.


[10/24/2020 12:44 PM] Justin1000#9555
Good we are on Gate.io. But they were crap for helping us raise awareness. Didn't even do a AMA and the volume there is almost zero. We can try to fix this with China marketing. Also, when we get ready to launch China marketing lets push Gate.io to help promote. We can tell them as part of our China marketing we also certainly be promoting our listing on Gate.io and enouraging people trade there.


[10/24/2020 11:32 PM] kushti#0978
I can ask gate about AMA etc

HT suddenly fell sharply, 100 million USDT was transferred, COO was reported to be investigated but there was no response temporarily, triggering panic in the Chinese market. Huobi is the largest exchange in China. After the OK, Huobi was also panicked.

They have a Chinese version of their website and can access it in mainland China without a VPN, so that's good. Could be that they are too small to have been blocked yet.

@Justin1000 Well we already knew Huobi was top target. It was #2 after Binance. We were supposed to apply online as first step. But think this is reason why we haven't taken that first step yet because they ask for all this personal data upload. Guess we need to coordinate and apply. Probably info will have to be sent to one person to make online application. Unless there is an easier way and they can just contact us first which would be a lot better!


[11/10/2020 12:43 AM] Justin1000#9555
me and @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ had long discussion with Serena at OKEX yesterday. They want $800k listing fee. But anyway, I think it was great discussion and we take things step-by-step and maybe we can get over the line with them for free or something close to it. She sounded very interested in fact and said would research project in depth and bring it to attention of internal teams including MINING (I pushed this really hard in light of the fork). They got their own pool and have tons of mining connections. She is joining our channels, even offered to help a bit and also suggested maybe some tentative marketing to get feedback. Guess @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ will follow up on those things. I actually think good chance OKEX could be better next exchange than Huobi as they might be able to offer more of what we need in immediate future like marketing and mining while Huobi being so big may just list us and forget about us like Gate.io did. Regardless we should be going after both vigorously and would be good to start discussions with Huobi soon to find out their approach!

[11/14/2020 1:41 AM] Justin1000#9555
So seems we should approach Huobi ASAP. The above 2 pdfs are what is needed for online app (have to log in to see). But its mainly personal info. I think can probably just use 3 people and reuse people for the CTO/CMO role that were already listed in the community liist of 3 names above. @kushti think you will need be one of 3 and also listed as "CTO". We can just apply as a "community" so no Company info required. If do it this way, I am okay to send in my info. I can do the application if people want and they can send info to me. The other thing is maybe @Dmitry Meshkov submitting the info from his account could make sense since he has active market making account there but I'm not sure it would help so don't really care.


[11/14/2020 1:41 AM] Justin1000#9555
But again not sure all this necessary. Not sure when they will review and seems kind of stupid actually. They don't even ask for that much info on project itself.


[11/14/2020 1:43 AM] Justin1000#9555
So I think 3 options are: 1) Email Huobi from the official Ergo email and express desire on behalf of the Ergo Foundation to list on Huobi and we are ready to talk and provide all necessary info etc; 2) Find a contact through Waves/Emurgo/Cardano/Maxmillian to start a direct dialogue and bypass this BS online app **(THIS PREFERRED)**; 3) send in the online app like i describe above and just hope they respond


[11/14/2020 1:45 AM] Justin1000#9555
Guess possibly wont list on any new exchanges before the HF. Hopefully that is done by December and we can get listed on new exchanges immediately after the fork. But better to start any discussions with exchanges now.


[11/16/2020 10:36 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 ok so I can fill and also ask for connections there


[11/16/2020 10:37 AM] kushti#0978
We can obtain some


[11/16/2020 10:37 AM] kushti#0978
What about Binance?


[11/16/2020 4:23 PM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti good. lets list on Huobi, Binance and OKEx as soon as possible. But we can talk about best timing around the HF etc. if takes a little longer guess is better to do it at right time then rush listings.


[11/16/2020 4:23 PM] Justin1000#9555
Let me know if you need any info from me for Huobi...can send you in email. (i mean like CV/photo and other BS like that)


[11/16/2020 4:25 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah on Binance...OSL head trader told me he knows Head of BD and Strategic Partnerships. I should push the trader tomorrow and see if he can help. But I suppose we might have better contacts elsewhere but I should try anyway.


[11/23/2020 12:46 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Do we have a legal opinion? Can anyone please share it to me?

@kushti just found that changelly has launched own exchange this year https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/changelly-pro/ . I remember you had a good contact with them, maybe listing there also?


[11/26/2020 5:02 PM] kushti#0978
@Dmitry Meshkov I know their CEO since like 2010 that's not helping though

bitcoin.com seems great to pursue and its good they mention promotional activities up-front.


[12/09/2020 6:37 AM] kushti#0978
ok let's talk


[12/09/2020 6:38 AM] kushti#0978
so what is the current plan about exchanges ?


[12/09/2020 6:38 AM] kushti#0978
will have a call with ZBX today


[12/09/2020 10:50 AM] kushti#0978
ZBX: 20K Euro deposit, refundable if we bring 3K accounts with deposits in 3 months


[12/09/2020 10:51 AM] kushti#0978
Exchange has support from Swiss banks


[12/09/2020 10:51 AM] kushti#0978
Can issue debit cards etc


[12/09/2020 10:57 AM] mx#5165
they have like only usdt pairs and 7 of them, needs to be new one if regulated


[12/09/2020 10:58 AM] kushti#0978
will have a call with Bitcoin.com guy tomorrow


[12/09/2020 11:15 AM] mx#5165
ZBX only has top coins, but if legit contact price is ok i guess


[12/09/2020 11:20 AM] kushti#0978
but we can't do 3K regs for such an exchange I guess


[12/09/2020 11:32 AM] mx#5165
yes so price 20k, for rest of requirements i guess everyone hires squad from Indonesia lol


[12/17/2020 9:06 AM] kushti#0978
Bitcoin.com + Changelly = 5 BTC (3.6 BTC + 1.4 BTC in Erg), including contest & marketing


[12/17/2020 9:09 AM] kushti#0978

[12/17/2020 1:41 PM] kushti#0978
Had a call with BitMart guy, not sure lol but maybe the listing will be free


[12/17/2020 5:11 PM] kushti#0978
yeah, free, but


[12/17/2020 5:12 PM] kushti#0978
"Since we do require liquidity support from partners waived listing fee, please confirm with the guy you mentioned if he can do it. Because we have to put volume no lower than 2BTC in the agreement or we can‚Äôt process. But as I said, we are not that restrict to that, a reasonable volume and spread similar as Gate and Probit you currently have would be fine."


[12/17/2020 5:12 PM] kushti#0978
@Dmitry Meshkov doable ?


[12/17/2020 5:47 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Spread similar to Probit is definitely doable, even much better should be fine with simple AMM bots. As far as I see it's integrated to https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt, I may try to use existing MM bots for it. Not sure how it works, though, looks like it's not a popular and well established exchange)


[12/17/2020 5:53 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
2 BTC volume is hard to predict, I don't know their userbase.. There are quite popular projects there that have lower volume (e.g. Uniswap, Compound, Augur and so on)


[12/17/2020 6:13 PM] kushti#0978
@Dmitry Meshkov we're ahead of Augur & Compound on gate.io


[12/17/2020 8:15 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Don‚Äôt you think that the price is too high for such exchange?


[12/17/2020 8:28 PM] kushti#0978
@Dmitry Meshkov listing is free, as mentioned above. We need to make some MM.


[12/17/2020 8:40 PM] kushti#0978
Bitcoin.com + Changelly new offer: $70K in BTC / USDT + $30K in ergs


[12/18/2020 5:20 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Oh, I misunderstood you. So the question about MM was about BitMart? I was talking about Bitcoin.com...


[12/18/2020 5:24 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
And the price concern was about Bitcoin.com also, on CMC rating it is #123, much lower than our existing exchanges (Probit, Gate, Coinex)


[12/18/2020 5:47 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
So both exchanges are worse than exchanges we already have, look like they won‚Äôt provide any value. Not sure about changelly, I don‚Äôt know anyone who use it, so it‚Äôs hard to imagine their audience


[12/18/2020 9:25 AM] Robert K#0722
Personally I'm still not really in favour of getting any more exchanges right now, but instead focusing EF funds on grants for educational material for both users to use dApps, and devs to come into the ecosystem + hackthons + grants for projects.


[12/18/2020 9:25 AM] Robert K#0722
Even Binance I don't think would really be that helpful right now (I imagine it would pump and dump, and we'd be in a similar situation without too many users)


[12/18/2020 8:32 PM] kushti#0978
What's good about Bitmart is that they can consider listing of tokens on top on Ergo later (legal opinion is needed though likely)


[12/18/2020 8:40 PM] mx#5165
Hotbit wouldn`t do it? for Bitcoin.com there is need for mm otherwise volume will be 0, are there any more exchanges known with own mm above Binance?


[12/18/2020 8:42 PM] mx#5165
it creates volume so it dumps to level where there is real demand whatever price it could be, that`s how standard mm works


[12/18/2020 8:43 PM] mx#5165
that`s how Hotbit works


[12/18/2020 8:45 PM] kushti#0978
Binance is asking for MM I guess. Bitcoin.com MM should be easy for @Dmitry Meshkov as it is the same as HitBTC


[12/18/2020 8:46 PM] kushti#0978
To me, more exchanges with any REAL volume the better for sure


[12/18/2020 8:47 PM] mx#5165
as far i know Binance doesn`t, similar to Hotbit, well Hotbit itself made huge pumps for many coins so at least one mm is there


[12/18/2020 8:57 PM] mx#5165
changelly was something like shapeshift, then looks like they decided to make centralized exchange from it(maybe also own mm), then they did atomic wallet


[12/18/2020 8:59 PM] kushti#0978
Changelly also was not suppressed by regulators, unlike ShapeShift


[12/18/2020 8:59 PM] mx#5165
yes, but probably they developed atomic wallet because volume was running away


[12/18/2020 9:01 PM] mx#5165
and it is much more easy to put volume on standard centralized exchange like they are doing now, all these billions appearing suddenly everywhere


[12/18/2020 9:02 PM] kushti#0978
@mx also ,they're doing wallets )


[12/18/2020 9:03 PM] kushti#0978
Atomic / Guarda / Magnum is from the same crew (divided on the way)


[12/18/2020 9:03 PM] mx#5165
they are skilled guys as far i remember, Charlie Shrem also involved


[12/18/2020 9:03 PM] kushti#0978
they had done some more wallets I've forgotten


[12/18/2020 9:05 PM] mx#5165
myabe ask them about mm, on changelly it looks there is big chance they do their own


[12/18/2020 9:05 PM] mx#5165
on bitcoin.com hundreds have 0 volume


[12/18/2020 9:07 PM] mx#5165

[12/18/2020 9:20 PM] kushti#0978
finally


[12/18/2020 9:29 PM] mx#5165
yeah looks like some interest is appearing there


[12/19/2020 8:16 AM] Justin1000#9555
I tend to agree with Robert/Dmitry. Don't see enough benefit from paying such large amounts for these 2nd tier exchanges right now. Bitcoin.com is just kinda interesting cuz it might lead to possibility to work with Roger but should just talk to him direct first and see if he is interested. Would be good to have a very public and prominent influencer for ergo...somebody like him.


[12/19/2020 8:17 AM] Justin1000#9555
I still think would be great to list on Biance and OKex and other top tier exchanges as soon as possible tho. (Probably asap after fork...)


[12/19/2020 8:28 AM] Justin1000#9555
Free exchanges like Bitmart also good...


[12/20/2020 3:15 PM] kushti#0978

[12/21/2020 3:15 PM] kushti#0978
Bitcoin.com / Changelly - NO
BIKI - ???
BitMart - ???

Which exchanges to talk with now ?


[12/21/2020 6:33 PM] mx#5165
my vote would be for Biki only from the existing options


[12/22/2020 1:04 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I think we could consider Biki if it was free, but I think it would be a waste of Ergs and precious time to spend to list on Biki or any other  exchange unless it is a TOP TIER exchange (in which case  we would still need to consider cost-to-benefit ratio).  I think this was also the sentiment already detailed by Robert/Dmitry/BitmanSachs. Not sure really why we would even consider paying to list on Biki. Seems even a waste of time (must have taken kushti at list a few minutes to write it out above) to propose the offer from Biki.


[12/22/2020 2:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
Free exchanges would be good especially if come with some promotion. But 2nd tier exchanges at ~2BTC (US$50k now!) don‚Äôt seem worth it. I think should save the funds or use them for something that will boost users and developers. CZ said users were only thing that Binance cared about for listings. Crypto exchange industry very concentrated with big real volume at only a few top exchanges. More 2nd tier listings seems of limited benefit. Time to list on top exchanges.  Ergo launched mainnet 1.5 years ago and had non-stop development over past ~3 years. Too bad so far Binance/Okex/Huobi/Bitfinex etc all have said no or asked for an absurd listing fee.


[12/22/2020 2:32 AM] Justin1000#9555
Should probably have a think if any more marketing toward miners/developers/users should be done ahead of the fork. Probably be better use of US$50k then another 2nd tier exchange.

[12/22/2020 10:35 AM] morphic#4133
I agree with the point that exchanges is not the main issue of Ergo organic growth at the moment. The main issue I see is that ergoplatform is still not really easy accessible as "the platform". 
On one hand we have the Core Platform with almost unlimited technical capabilities (I mean reference client), which is rather hard to setup and develop on top of it directly. 
On the other hand we have a bunch of Apps with different look and feel, quality/maturity level and underlying technology (some of them Scala/Java based, others Rust based, and others JS based)
And there is a huge gap in between the Core and the Apps, and each new developer need to fill this gap in order to deliver the functional application. And we should not be surprised if that new app will be unique of its own, reflecting personality of the developer, rather than sharing the common qualities of The Platform. 
From this perspective we still don't have developer friendly App Platform/Framework - a single, consistent and feature complete portable library which can be used for Web, Mobile and desktop apps. 
This is where I think we should put our funds first.


[12/22/2020 10:55 AM] morphic#4133
For listing on top exchanges I think we really need just one of them, and others will come up with more realistic proposals. 
We can publish some kind of Tier-1 Listing Grant on our site, describing the requirements we expect from Tier-1 exchange listing and the amount of ERG (can be a range depending on the proposal) we are ready to pay for the winning exchange. Then we can advertise this grant among exchanges.
So the incentive is that the first "winning" exchange gets the listing fees, while others are missing this opportunity potentially forever and ultimately will be listing Erg for free.

For small exchanges. We already have a bunch of them, I don't think we should waste time even considering communicating with them beyond the kind replies. 
I even think additional such listings may even be harmful as they may pull out liquidity from already existing exchanges.

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[12/22/2020 11:00 AM] morphic#4133
In the Tier-1 Listing Grant mentioned above we can also describe our interest to find not just Tier-1 exchange, but Tier1 Strategic Partner Exchange with whatever topic of long-term collaboration (DeFi, etc.)


[12/22/2020 1:08 PM] morphic#4133
https://www.ergoforum.org/t/exchange-native-ergo-dapps/516
So, looking from this perspective I think we are not completely ready for this
conversation with the exchanges, because as I wrote above, we don't have an appealing App
developers platform. Sure we can try to (and probably should) talk this way with them, but
frankly, if I were on the exchange side making technical decision about Ergo platform, I
would qualify it as "potentially perspective, but not ready yet". This brings us back to
The App Platform issue we have and which we should address as of highest priority.

Exchange-Native Ergo dApps
Every Exchange is a fintech business in a highly competitive market. As a result they have  to develop new products beyond deposit/trade/withdraw cycle.  Ergo has a unique yet still unrealized opportunity for exchanges to go beyond ‚Äújust  exchange‚Äù and implement a new category of apps for their users.  We can call them Exchange-Native dApps - ap...


[12/22/2020 2:22 PM] Robert K#0722
Yeah, I agree with the overall sentiment


[12/23/2020 12:03 PM] kushti#0978
@morphic for some time in Twitter etc, after getting few feedbacks, I'm avoiding to use "platform" term at all, as it sounds like some monolithic corporate product, which is not we do really have. Instead, "Ergo protocol" is used now.


[12/23/2020 1:13 PM] morphic#4133
The "platform" is popular in business cycles focusing on innovation to differentiate "product-first" vs "platform-first" business. Square, Stripe, Apple, Amazon, Google, Cloudflare, Shopify, etc are all examples of "platform-first" approach. 
Protocol is something the platform can be based on, but not something that can be sold.


[12/23/2020 1:13 PM] morphic#4133
Apple, Amazon, Google maybe not 100% in this category, but they are catching up.


[12/24/2020 6:06 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Maybe the "Ergo layer 1 protocol", "Ergo base protocol" or  "Ergo public blockchain" (public blockchain "ÂÖ¨Èìæ" is what they use in Chinese)?


[12/24/2020 6:07 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
It might be more clear (especially now in the Defi era, compared to a year or two ago) to emphasize that Ergo is 100% stand-alone and independent, not a protocol or something else running on top of Ethereum, or a Dex.


[12/24/2020 8:39 AM] morphic#4133
What would be the point of switching from "platform" to "protocol" terminology, especially since they are different concepts and both can be used? Why we should constrain ourselves in using both of them? Platform is used in many contexts (not just enterprise) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform, as well as many usages of protocol https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol. Have I missed some prior discussion?


[12/24/2020 8:50 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
platform and protocol both seem fine to me.


[12/24/2020 10:51 AM] kushti#0978
@morphic @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ yeah, platform could be fine, if defined. But it is not


[12/25/2020 7:03 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
In regards to exchanges, I propose to consider a professional market maker service. E.g. at Dymmax we've just started trades on Probit, but have 127/37 liquidity parameters at CMC (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dymmax/markets/). Ergo has much better exchanges like gate.io/coinex but underperforms on them so far. It might be done in a form of a grant like @morphic  proposed, IMHO it would be a much better use of funds, than pay for a new listing.


[12/25/2020 7:13 PM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Another option to consider  is to implement Ethereum gateway like Waves recently did to open access to Ethereum DEXes like Uniswap/1inch an so on. Maybe it would even be possible to use Waves infrastructure as far as they should already have everything to do it.


[12/26/2020 10:10 AM] Justin1000#9555
Gateways to Ethereum sounds interesting.


[12/26/2020 10:12 AM] Justin1000#9555
I wish there was a way to put bitcoin onto Ergo and then use ergo dapps to add value to bitcoin. The ergo mixer for example is perhaps the most powerful privacy tech in all of crypto and the privacy on bitcoin is terrible so seems like would be good immediate use case for ergo.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[12/26/2020 10:14 AM] Justin1000#9555
Despite how great the mixer is not too exciting at this moment cuz it is just usable for ergo and ergo doesn't have to many users yet. I know the stable coin could be huge but may take a little time to get traction. I kinda feel some value added things ergo could do for bitcoin would be most exciting immediate use case


[12/26/2020 10:15 AM] Justin1000#9555
Or value add to Ethereum too...


[12/26/2020 10:21 AM] Justin1000#9555
Bitcoin USD 400bn market cap now. If we could add value to bitcoin then do 10 to 100x on the erg price we would have tons of developers flocking to ergo. Would be nice if we could support 1 or 2 killer apps that get used immediately and maybe not solely reliant on ergo ecosystem build out as that will take some time. This would speed that up too. If can be done...

It would also be easier and cheaper to list ERC20-ERG on other exchanges, as far as I know FTX only agreed to list ERC20-WAVES, rather than a native Waves. Not sure it's a good idea though)


[12/26/2020 10:19 PM] kushti#0978
In regards with gateways, joint work with Gravity started. It will bring USDT/USDN/USDC etc on top of Ergo, and Ergo on top of Binance Chain, Ethereum, etc

In regards with other matters (MM, ERC-20, etc), I do not see who's ready to take responsibility for what


[12/27/2020 7:52 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
I can share a pretty big MM list if you wish, made an investigation of this topic recently. They may charge pretty high fees (e.g. Blockstack paid $100k setup fee + $20k per 6 months for GSR Markets), but it should be possible to find a pretty good MM for 2 BTC we were willing to pay for listing

I wonder who could do it. Maybe open this idea for grant proposal?


[12/28/2020 11:10 AM] Justin1000#9555
Shouldn't even need a grant. If can be done technically should be making money quick. They can just charge fees and sell a part of the profit via tokens. I dunno know what can be done technically well enough. But I am just saying it would be really powerful if could easily put btc onto ergo and then use ergo functionality

[12/30/2020 10:01 AM] Justin1000#9555
Well, that is better. Maybe it MIGHT be worth it. But we should think in terms of opportunity cost. That is more than $40k in todays prices. That could be used for Ledger integration. Or just given to the Ergonauts to market with.


[12/30/2020 10:03 AM] Justin1000#9555
If we do, do it, we should maximize everything we get from them. Like detailed agreement on what marketing we will do together. Also, 1) can they introduce us to miners and pools; 2) they have those good investors @mx pointed out. Can they show Ergo them? It would be good if some big names bought Ergo in secondary and became stakeholders (something I know we have discussed many times). I'd be happy to chat with them in China.


[12/30/2020 10:53 AM] Robert K#0722
I'll just reiterate my position that I probably won't be voting for any exchanges for the time being for funding unless there's a realllllly good reason for it


[12/30/2020 10:54 AM] Robert K#0722
I'd rather we just have an ambassador program or something and where we effectively hire like 20 community members part-time for a full year for the same amount of funds


[12/30/2020 10:57 AM] Robert K#0722
Maybe that's something the EF should do for the Ergo Summit as well? Create an ambassador program (just 1 page on ergoplatform.org with an email for people to submit their applications to) where we fund people on a monthly basis to represent Ergo/create videos/write articles/...


[12/30/2020 10:57 AM] Robert K#0722
And we can announce the program at the Ergo Summit, so this really feels like a new era


[12/30/2020 10:58 AM] Robert K#0722
Im 99% sure something like the above will be 100x better use of Ergs than getting another random exchange tbh


[12/30/2020 11:06 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah I agree. The details are just not my forte so I dont know what to propose exactly but I also think 40k could be better used otherwise in marketing and what @Robert K proposes above makes sense to me. If are going to do something like that then should role it out soon too ahead of HF!


[12/30/2020 11:08 AM] Justin1000#9555
Again I do think top 10 exchanges which also will help us market are probably worth the 40 or 50k tho. But 2nd tier exchanges not so much. Feel could get more out of other marketing like what Robert mentions.


[12/30/2020 1:03 PM] morphic#4133
I also agree with @Robert K


[12/30/2020 1:38 PM] kushti#0978

That is a pathetic response. What a bunch of jokers. I was pushing artlan at ftx today (ex head of Russia for bitmex). Anyway that is sad.


[12/30/2020 2:25 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 heh, especially as Binance guy recommended to get on some other exchange Tier1 first


[12/30/2020 2:25 PM] kushti#0978
so it seems Huobi -> Binance -> FTX is the way


[12/30/2020 2:25 PM] kushti#0978

Coinomi: 1.5 BTC in Erg


[01/20/2021 6:16 AM] Justin1000#9555
So this is good. I am talking direct to CEO of Gate now thanks to Mr. Tan, the miner and one of our future China ambassadors. Happy to do AMA. She suggests providing US$500 worth of Ergs for the AMA. sounds fine to me. BUT we may have a marketing budget with them! I thought we paid 50k Ergs for airdrop but gave 100k Ergs in total. She needs to check details but she says that 50K Ergs maybe left over marketing budget! that would be great if so!

@kushti


[01/20/2021 1:49 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 wow, great news! Yes, we gave them 100K ergs, btw we had voting on that.

Can we get in touch with gate.io devs? They need to update the node to 4.0.x.


[01/20/2021 2:49 PM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti talking to her and her ppl say only got 50k ERG. maybe some "funny business" going on over there with some of her people. Can you tell me 1) TXID and 2) who have you been liasing with exactly? Important to know so she can sort it out. Could be we will have a budget there for marketing.


[01/20/2021 2:50 PM] Justin1000#9555
Need more details so can sort this out. Their internal issues are not our problem (if there are indeed such issues) but we should tell her what she needs to know. Also maybe some ERG marketing budget hereüòÄ

[01/21/2021 7:35 AM] Justin1000#9555
Was it Jill Chow from Gate who your introduced us to on wechat? She never responded to our messages i think. I vaguely recall you were talking to someone else too though.


[01/21/2021 10:07 AM] kushti#0978
yeah so 100 K were sent to 9iKFBBrryPhBYVGDKHuZQW7SuLfuTdUJtTPzecbQ5pQQzD4VykC , still this address is associated with gate.io node it seems


[01/21/2021 10:09 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 initially I was in talks with Page Chou, then he disappeared, then I continued with Jill Chow, then she turned out to be not responsive as well. So we need for some contact to inform about node updates, discuss marketing etc

[01/22/2021 12:39 AM] Justin1000#9555
I just filled out the app and applied online to Crypto.com. They look like really big exchange now with real volume and traffic. Said get a lot of apps and would contact us if are short listed. Should keep on radar and if we have any contacts, should pursue them!


[01/22/2021 12:43 AM] Justin1000#9555
Didn't Bittrex say we need the Liechenstein opinion and could list there? Or were there more conditions too? If its just that opinion then we should just find a lawyer and get it right? Adding another top 15 exchange post fork would be good. No idea how  long Binance/OKEX/Huobi will take.


[01/22/2021 12:44 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti who were you talking to at Bittrex? is it the listing manager...I think his name is Eric. I met a Bitrex guy here a couple weeks ago and he asked me but I didn't know. I think he mentioned "Eric" was listing manager but I can double check.


[01/22/2021 7:01 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 I did talk with Chris, VP of Bitcoin Global . They are not responsive these days ( . Also, Bittrex is going down it seems

Gate CEO says found the 50k ERGs and wondering what type of activities we want to do. So we can have a think about it and timing. I guess AMA, maybe some marketing activities targeted at miners etc. Anyway can think about it more and see if she has any ideas. Also will check if we got the FULL 50k for such activities...or some lesser amount..


[01/22/2021 8:02 AM] Justin1000#9555
i told her about the update...guess it will be handled or they will let us know if need anything. told her you were on wechat...


[01/22/2021 8:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
Well I don't think it adds much unfortunately even though the cost is not too high. Took a look earlier and appears another 2nd tier exchange with huge fake volume. The only reason I can see to maybe do it is because we are just listed on TOO FEW exchanges. So for redundancy and to just increase the headline number of exchanges we are on, it may be justified.


[01/22/2021 8:25 AM] kushti#0978
Well, we're going to be listed on BitMart for free


[01/22/2021 8:25 AM] kushti#0978
To increase total number


[01/22/2021 8:47 AM] Justin1000#9555
Excellent. Havent talked to bitmart for ages. Think last time was asking for a lot of money. I recall they got a US license so could be good addition !


[01/22/2021 12:04 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 yes, they have US license, at the same time, Singaporean opinion was accepted, and the listing is free


[01/22/2021 12:04 PM] kushti#0978

Biki: 1 BTC, sounds good ?

{Reactions}
üëç 

[01/23/2021 2:41 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think we should do it. 1 BTC is a lot and I would rather have that as an award in a hackathon or paying someone to solve the lack of friendly developer tools and writeups but we need more exchanges given how few we are now and also soon will have the stable coin AND its governance token. And Biki has got Dujun, Fonder of Huobi, Genesis Capital Zhu Huai Yang, FBG Capital and ChainUP in there as investors. So that is more Du Jun is also the #1 guy with Jinse so possibly one more connect into Huobi.


[01/23/2021 2:43 AM] Justin1000#9555
But @kushti before we finalize anything with these Chinese exchanges, better to put me @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ and Eva in contact! We will probably get a lot more out of them if Eva is chasing them up on everything we can do together. Not too mention she can also chase Biki on the connection to Dujun and get to the bottom of that. Dont underestimate how much the on-the-ground China connection can help!


[01/23/2021 2:44 AM] Justin1000#9555

[01/25/2021 12:48 AM] Justin1000#9555
$50k is probably too much. Its good to add a few exchanges but we aren't in such desperate need we need to pay for so much for 2nd tier exchanges. Really need top 15 exchanges at this point.

I asked Biki ppl to invite us into wechat and we can talk more there...maybe in Chinese. Maybe can 1) impress them and get them to lower fee; 2) maybe we find out they are better than I think and so even worth $50k. Also good to discuss upfront what kinda joint marketing and other cooperation we can do.

[01/26/2021 7:23 AM] Justin1000#9555
Conversations to-date seem to be with intnl guys and they didn't want to bring in their China team before finalizing docs since they are presumably taking ownership of it. Mr Tan knows Biki's CEO so I could get in touch with him that way but said no as don't want to go behind backs of people we are negotiating with. But once we do agree listing, then good to get into wechat group with Eva and them to make sure we maximize the post-listing marketing right.


[01/26/2021 7:42 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti Just talking with Gate. On promotion too but URGENT things is NODE UPDATE. Can you please go to the wechat and open up the group I just invited you into? She says whatever needs to be done tell her there and she will forward direct to the tech people. Gate is weird! I guess they don't like clear communication!

[01/28/2021 1:06 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
With all the momentum we have going now I wonder if it might be a good time to consider putting out a paid promotion piece on Youtube now?  I had contacted some crypto Youtubers in Sept/Oct last year and around that time:
1) DataDash Youtube (376K subscribers) 5-7 minute review for US$4,000;
2) Chico Crypto (173K subscribers) 3-5 minute video for US$10,000;

Also van on Tech (340K subscribers) in Dec. 2019 offered 20 minute review video + 2 mentions (5 minutes each) in two other daily videos for US$13k.

Should we follow up with any of these guys now and put out a Youtube video?

Hi everyone!
Did all the exchanges updated their nodes? Tidex, Probit, waves.exchange, Coinex, Gate.io?
I‚Äôm in some chats there, but there is no activity there


[02/02/2021 6:00 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
Let‚Äôs at least inform them to stop deposits and withdrawals until they are updated


[02/02/2021 7:41 AM] Justin1000#9555
Gate won't talk about node. But Kushti told them need to update and how and they said days ago development team was informed so presumably they are sorted or would have raised issues. But no way to know for sure as they are unresponsive on this topic.


[02/02/2021 9:19 AM] Dmitry Meshkov#1652
How about our old exchanges, like Tidex, waves.exchange, Probit? Looks like they are not even informed


[02/02/2021 9:35 AM] kushti#0978

The first 100 members can scan a QR code to get into the group, but after 100 members it is not possible to scan a QR code to enter the group. For members 200-500, they need to be invited by another chat group member, owner or manager one by one.


[02/02/2021 11:15 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
You are already in our group 8.  I just sent you an invite for our group 9 (8 is the first group, there never was 1-7).


[02/02/2021 11:16 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Also just sent you the "name card" for our WeChat Official Account.


[02/02/2021 11:27 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
If anyone wants to join one of our Ergo WeChat groups they can use their WeChat App to scan Eva's QR code below to request to add her as a contact. After Eva accepts, she can invite such person into the chat(s).

Looks like gate.io and probit are not using the node at all


[02/03/2021 7:16 AM] kushti#0978
Withdrawals and deposits are okay there


[02/12/2021 7:35 PM] kushti#0978

[02/12/2021 7:35 PM] kushti#0978
Kucoin is asking for a counter-proposal @Justin1000 @mx any thought ?

ok so we have now some advantage in ERG tokens


[02/12/2021 7:56 PM] mx#5165
$150,000 in ERG, campaign $50,000 in ERG, deposit $50,000 in ERG


[02/12/2021 8:25 PM] Robert K#0722
Wow they really are greedy


[02/12/2021 8:26 PM] Robert K#0722
So they're asking for $200k total with a $50k deposit?


[02/12/2021 8:27 PM] mx#5165
in previous proposal about $330k actually


[02/12/2021 8:28 PM] mx#5165
at start they asked about $150k as far i remember


[02/12/2021 8:42 PM] mx#5165
@kushti tell them point 5 is not an option as Ergo is new and there are no market makers, so we want put deposit in their market maker hands


[02/12/2021 8:44 PM] mx#5165
that should delete also most things from point 3


[02/12/2021 8:47 PM] mx#5165
if they agree then we can consider more than $250k in total if it comes to negotiations


[02/13/2021 6:17 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Great if we have enough resources to do KuCoin listing now but I think currently more important is our marketing and to  hire dev(s) as per @morphic post in Foundation channel on 7 Feb and also my follow up post there today.


[02/13/2021 7:52 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think we should look to close the deal with Kucoin if possible. #13 on coingecko exchange rankings, 416k twitter followers and lots of asks for them in our Telegram (guess these could be fake but probably not). It could be quite expensive but in the absence of substantive discussions with top ~5 exchanges, we should probably be willing to devote significant resources to this in near term. Kucoin would probably be good enough to satisfy community for now ‚Äì not sure Biki/Bitmart will do that. Also, this is a continuation of our negotiations last year and it‚Äôs a good sign they are coming to us asking for a counter-proposal at this time.


[02/13/2021 7:55 AM] Justin1000#9555
But they are indeed greedy as @Robert K  mentions. Gate.io is #5 on Coingecko and we are doing AMA with them on Feb 22nd and Gate agreed to list us for 100k Ergs when Erg price and volume were much lower. So US$250k all-in seems on the high end to me.


[02/13/2021 7:56 AM] Justin1000#9555
I would note that we already made a counter proposal to Kucoin in Oct-2020. It was:
*Listing fee: 100k Ergs (we proposed same to Gate.io and Bittrex and I think OKEX & Bitfinex too less formally)
*Listing campaign: None
*Market Making Deposit: US$20k + US$20k worth of ERGs


[02/13/2021 7:57 AM] Justin1000#9555
Another data point is we just recently agreed to list on Biki for approx. US$70k including listing campaign and market making deposit.


[02/13/2021 8:00 AM] Justin1000#9555
Agree with @mx proposal above on the framework with them doing market making etc and the $150k in ERG + $50k in ERG + $50k in ERG deposit. To me, the rationale for accepting up to $250k even though is high is that it is only a bit above 100k ERGs at current price which we proposed before and now we are also asking them to do market making. Hopefully, they are really keen to list ERG with all the good things happening now and will accept.


[02/13/2021 8:04 AM] Justin1000#9555
If they agree to @mx points above on framework they will probably still come back and ask for more than $250k or a big USDT component but we can consider that then.


[02/13/2021 9:51 AM] Robert K#0722
I'm 50/50 on this, but if you guys think it's a good idea I'm fine with it


[02/15/2021 5:19 AM] Justin1000#9555
Not much more than 50-50 myself to be honest. $250k is a lot and Kucoin is more like a top ~15 exchange than top 5. But 1) we are in a bull market and costs may only be going up; 2) we really do need more exchanges; 3) people in chat are asking for more exchanges and kucoin in particular; 4) we don't have substantive discussions going on with others like top 5 at moment; 5) at current ERG price its roughly same as our last proposal; 6) supposedly Kucoin is good at marketing.


[02/15/2021 5:20 AM] Justin1000#9555
I would say guideline with Kucoin should be max amount should be the lower of 1) ~120k Ergs (including listing fee + marketing + market making) - this is pretty consistent with offers we made last year; 2) ~$250k equivalent with max % possible in ERGs. So if ERG price goes up a lot then the ~$250k equivalent becomes max. BUT most important first step is getting them to agree on the framework that @mx mentioned above.


[02/15/2021 5:20 AM] Justin1000#9555
Kraken would be better. @kushti if you have good contact with Kraken from last year, we may try to re-initiate discussions with them immediately and just see if they will take the ~100k ERGs now for listing? I actually talked to multiple people personally about Ergo and they would have bought sometime ago if on Kraken.


[02/15/2021 5:21 AM] Justin1000#9555
Others as far as I know - Bitfinex: have continued to chase up my friend...around time of summit he said would keep an eye on it; OKEx: Said watching Ergo last time and we update them occasionally; Huobi: Nothing from me on this except I hope with Jinse partnership + Biki roads into Dujun's group, we might get listed there this year if other things work out; Binance: nothing from me on them. Don't know them at all; Coinbase: Don't know them or care about them. Guess will be long time before get listed there so think Kraken strongly preferred for US.


[02/15/2021 5:21 AM] Justin1000#9555
After the Biki and Bitmart listings, really am doubtful we should spend any more Ergs on 2nd tier exchanges which is probably every exchange except those in the top ~15- I believe it to be highly concentrated industry despite a lot of wash trading and fake volume making it hard to tell. Preferably we get on 1 or 2 of top 5 soon.


[02/15/2021 7:03 AM] Justin1000#9555
Probably Kraken isn't an option yet. Kucoin is only relatively big exchange we talked to that is actively showing interest at this moment that I know of.


[02/15/2021 11:15 AM] morphic#4133
1) On the coingecko site, gate.io looks even better than kucoin. I don't think we need to pay more (in USD) for a similar rank exchange considering that kucoin has lost its race to gate.io on this level of exchanges.


[02/15/2021 11:15 AM] morphic#4133
2) I prefer to thinks that it is exchanges are chasing us for listing, not we are chasing them. This is because it is us who provide the unique value not them. And based on this assumption we can informally organise a kind of competition on each tier of exchanges, in which competition the first exchange gets listing fees and others a basically are going to list us for free (or lower fees).
So, in our counter proposal we can lower USD price and also include additional services.


[02/15/2021 11:15 AM] morphic#4133
3) Basically, if consider ERG listing as a long-term investment we should IMO strictly increase quality/usd ratio, i.e., roughly, either higher-rank exchange for the same money or same-rank exchange for lower money. 
So, if kucoin rejects our counter-proposal this time, it may end up listing us for free once we get to top 5 tier.


[02/15/2021 11:29 PM] kushti#0978
@morphic4-10 should be discussed in different channel I guess


[02/16/2021 9:03 AM] morphic#4133

@Justin1000 so any chance to get in touch with gate.io tech team?


[02/16/2021 9:26 AM] Justin1000#9555
We can just ask direct on the wechat. If ask should be specific about what. They don't seem open at all on the tech aspects so not sure if will respond at all.

[02/18/2021 7:57 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti @morphic @Robert K Any idea how compatible Huobi Eco chain is with Ergo? Can they use Oracle Pools on Ergo? Probably not a fair question as apparently not much materials on Huobi Eco Chain in English. Seems white paper and technical docs are all in Chinese. I can read those for more info when I have time but if you have any rough idea, please let us know. Probably to the extent an Ethereum app can use Ergo Oracle Pools, Huobi Eco chain could as it seems to be focused on being compatible with Ethereum.


[02/18/2021 7:58 AM] Justin1000#9555
Eva has the CEO of Jinse looking into it as well. If we could get a partnership going with Huobi ECO chain using Ergo oracles, would be extremly beneficial for listing on Huobi which is like #2 or #3 target for listing. I think the CEO of Jinse reports direct to Dujun who founded Huobi. So this is a very promising angle to push. Huobi also has huge ADA trading volume as mentioned in previous discussion.


[02/18/2021 10:01 AM] kushti#0978
We can apply to Huobi pool as well

[02/22/2021 10:56 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 can we ask gate about a lower number of confirmations ? 100 is way too much


[02/22/2021 12:41 PM] Justin1000#9555
Do you know the latest deposit # requirements for the other exchanges like Coinex/Hotbit/Tidex? If we ask them to reduce the 100 we should tell them what Coinex/Hotbit/Tidex are using to have a better chance. if you don't know off top of your head i can probably check myself...thanks


[02/22/2021 2:51 PM] Justin1000#9555
will check tomorrow how long hotbit/coinex/tidex take and then ask Gate to reduce. see how it goes...


[02/22/2021 6:54 PM] kushti#0978
Coinex - Hotbit like 30-40


[02/22/2021 6:55 PM] kushti#0978
I guess 32 is good


[02/23/2021 5:13 AM] Justin1000#9555

[02/23/2021 5:21 AM] Justin1000#9555
Some prelim notes took on DigiFinex. They claim to be global but appears to me to be a Chinese exchange.


[02/23/2021 5:22 AM] Justin1000#9555
Seems is typical 2nd tier fake volume exchange but possibly still even better than coinex and HotBit which I think was @Dmitry Meshkov prelim assessment last year when looking at it.


[02/23/2021 5:22 AM] Justin1000#9555
One thing that stood out is the ADA volume is claimed to be extremely high (#2 globally). Obviously it is mostly fake but to the extent it is indicative at all of prominence of ADA on the exchange, that would be a positive as there is so much interest in Ergo from Cardano users right now

listing pack got from Bay Yang above...


[02/23/2021 5:25 AM] Justin1000#9555
The offer from them is:


[02/23/2021 5:25 AM] Justin1000#9555
1. BTC/ETH/USDT Trading pairs.
 2. Free 24 months MM accounts with Zero transaction fee.
 3. Promotions on all of our website/APP/SNS/communities/ DigiFinex AMA.
 4. Tailored Marketing Strategies: Airdrops, Trading competitions, and other interactive events with traders.
 5. Expert Team Support: 7 x 24 hours Online Customer Services, Professional Monitoring and Alert System.


[02/23/2021 5:25 AM] Justin1000#9555
for** USDT 28k**. They won't accept ERGs.


[02/23/2021 5:29 AM] Justin1000#9555
I pushed him a bit on listing SigmaUSD but he said that would be separate. I wonder if we can get them to agree though to list it for a low fee subject to it $x million of SigmaUSD being issued. Note that any discussions with exchange listings now we should at least bring up SigmaUSD to maximize chance they will list it quick on good terms...


[02/23/2021 5:30 AM] Justin1000#9555
So disadvantages is its another 2nd tier exchange unlikely to make a fundamental difference and we need to pay in USDT and not in ERG. Advantages include low cost, includes free MM accounts, probably better in some ways at least to coinex/Hotbit and the high ADA volume is good to extent there is any truth in it at all.


[02/23/2021 5:33 AM] Justin1000#9555
Probably we should list on Kucoin ASAP. We are only on one good exchange right now and that is Gate.io. Kucoin also says US$100mm ADA trading volume. We need to get on some more good exchanges. Kucoin is pretty good!


[02/23/2021 5:36 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah I suppose we can wait say one week to see how the stable coin initially rolls out as it might boost the price etc but my recommendation is to aggressively pursue the Kucoin listing ASAP.


[02/23/2021 5:37 AM] Justin1000#9555
Regarding Digifinex, it is cheap at only $28k. I think we could go ahead and list there. But probably we should ask them to agree in advance to list SigmaUSD subject to [x] million SigmaUSD tokens being minted. It is same block chain as Ergo so little incremental work.


[02/23/2021 5:37 AM] Justin1000#9555
But KUCOIN is more important by far.


[02/23/2021 10:52 AM] Robert K#0722
Tbh expecting millions of SigmaUSD to be minted is a long shot.


[02/23/2021 10:52 AM] Robert K#0722
I'd expect in the hundreds of thousands.


[02/23/2021 10:52 AM] Robert K#0722
But a good idea to push for it for sure.


[02/23/2021 10:53 AM] Robert K#0722
28k isn't very much so I'd be fine with doing it.

[02/26/2021 7:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
Digifinex is inexpensive and I agree we should list there but only if @kushti thinks he has the time. Another 2nd tier exchange won't move the dial much and each one is taking quite a bit of time.


[02/26/2021 7:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think priority should be on getting listed on Kucoin during March.

[02/26/2021 7:32 AM] Justin1000#9555
Then we take aim at Huobi/Binance/Kraken/Bitfinex/OKEX for reset of year. If things continue to go well should have good chance at Huobi with our great relationship with Jinse - the CEO probably reports direct to Dujun, founder of Huobi.


[02/26/2021 7:39 AM] Justin1000#9555
I now really think we should seize this opportunity and list on Kucoin ASAP...don't need to do any other exchanges next 30-45 days besides them. Hopefully they can do the MM too so we can save more time.


[02/26/2021 3:30 PM] morphic#4133
I agree with @Justin1000, it is not worth to even spend time on Digifinex (not mentioning paying them). It is better to put those resources into top 5  exchanges.

much better offer than before, but MXC is not so exploding these days also ?


[03/09/2021 12:25 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
80K USDT would be much worse that their offer last July, namely: 2 BTC + 3 BTC in ergs = 5 x about $9,300 = USD 46K)

Among other things discussed MXC (ÊäπËå∂‰∫§ÊòìÊâÄÔºâ with Eva just yesterday in our group chat. She has been having conversations with people offering exchange listings. $240k for Bittrex. Only 10k ERGs for MXC.


[03/09/2021 3:05 AM] Justin1000#9555
I told her we didn't want to waste any more time with these small exchanges. Biki seems like a joke...@kushti still doing some KYC crap. Huge waste of time.


[03/09/2021 3:06 AM] Justin1000#9555
Let just do KUCOIN ASAP these 30 days. its the most asked for exchange in the community and within our grasp - so I guess up to $250k and get them to do market making. What MX suggested basically. Don't bother with anyone else unless big.


[03/09/2021 3:07 AM] Justin1000#9555
Eva is submitting a big application all in Chinese for Huobi. Might make a difference coming at it from China angle. But Kucoin should be immediate focus in my opinion.


[03/09/2021 5:45 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti we are trying to see what we can do with the 50k ERGs supposedly at gate. Ceo is saying we can't take out and need to spend per earlier arrangement. Who was person we dealt with at listing ?  Do u got a contract that specifies use of the 100k ERGs. I am surprised they are still there myself but that is what she told me a month ago


[03/09/2021 12:38 PM] kushti#0978
ok let's proceed with KuCoin


[03/09/2021 12:39 PM] kushti#0978
they asked me to reapply so they can give better price after re-evaluation

Discuss Desired Future Exchange Listings
Lets have a well organized discussion about the pros and cons of exchanges and what would be our preferred future listings for Ergo.  Don‚Äôt expect Binance to be said and then adopted, Lets clearly calculate the value and the rewards the best we can. I‚Äôm not the best on this topic but i know we have had in depth discussions on telegram about fees...


[03/10/2021 10:21 AM] Justin1000#9555
Eva was looking at Biki post the annojncement. And talking to some ppl in our groups. Dealing with them seems a mess but apparently they got some reputation and profile in China and the connection to dujun and other groups is good. So maybe wasn't a bad move listing there. But still very time consuming...


[03/10/2021 10:22 AM] Justin1000#9555
Huobi said needed higher liquidity (not surprising). Eva thinks they are in "observation mode"


[03/10/2021 10:25 AM] morphic#4133
By "liquidity" they mean total daily volumes of our coin over all exchanges? How much they want it to be?


[03/10/2021 10:32 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yes but don't know how much. Basically it means a significantly higher price and market cap and our listing prospects would be far more favorable at huobi. Pretty predictable response but good to start pushing now.

you can compare Ergo with e.g. Ravencoin by yourself


[03/17/2021 6:17 PM] kushti#0978
Bitcoin.com made new offer: "70,000 usdt, 50% in ERG tokens and 50% in usdt, that would allow us to cover all our marketing and technical integration costs whilst still maximising community activation"


[03/19/2021 1:40 AM] Justin1000#9555
The Bitcoin.com pricing doesn't seem unreasonable but I don't see much reason to spend the ERGs and more importantly your time on this. Also, we had Digifinex at cheaper. I think we should politely put off these 2 for now and see if can get on Kucoin in next 30-45 days.

We should see if can get a KRW pair added at probit and do some online event simultaneously. Korea is starting to go crazy again. Block stack announced krw pair on upbit yesterday and doubled in a single day (added ~$1 billion market cap)


[04/07/2021 2:30 PM] kushti#0978
Interesting, just because of Korea ?


[04/07/2021 2:31 PM] kushti#0978
How much are we ready to pay for KuCoin ?


[04/07/2021 2:31 PM] kushti#0978
We'll have another call with them next Wed


[04/07/2021 5:35 PM] Justin1000#9555
I am still good with what said before which was up to around USD 250k, get them to take as many ERGs as possible and they do the market making. Basically MX's proposal from before.


[04/12/2021 12:45 PM] kushti#0978
Will have a call with Kucoin tomorrow


[04/12/2021 12:45 PM] kushti#0978
I propose to accept the offer


[04/12/2021 12:45 PM] kushti#0978
Community is very eager about KuCoin


[04/12/2021 12:49 PM] Justin1000#9555
What is new offer? But anyway think i will agree. Kucoin listing is great next step on exchanges and community has been asking for many months.


[04/12/2021 5:50 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 our counter-offer is $40K for listing + $50K and $50K in ERG for MM , also 6 months of exclusivity (so we do not ask bigger exchanges about listing)


[04/13/2021 1:11 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
$40K would be better than their July 2020  offer of about $46K (2 BTC + 3 BTC in ergs = 5 x ~$9,300).


[04/13/2021 1:11 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Who would do the market making?


[04/13/2021 2:07 AM] Justin1000#9555
Wow I don't like 6 months exclusivity at all. Not in the middle of a  bull market and all the developments going on with Ergo. We should be targeting Huobi. I was talking to CEO of Jinse about it on Saturday at their conference in Shanghai.  Not sure feasibility but giving up the chance for 6 months is a big sacrifice. Better to pay a bit more rather than give 6 months exclusivity in my opinion.


[04/13/2021 2:09 AM] Justin1000#9555
I feel as though lack of more big exchanges and not being on any with significant Cardano trading is preventing us from getting bigger price gains on news and marketing. So just Kucoin in 6 months seems limiting. Huge amount can happen in 6 months in crypto !


[04/13/2021 2:14 AM] Justin1000#9555
3 months exclusivity starting ASAP would be okay probably.


[04/13/2021 3:18 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti Is that their counter-offer to us or our offer to them? If its our offer to them I don't know why we would propose 6 month exclusivity. Definitely not something we should be doing in current situation...this is not last year! You can include me in the discussions if you like. We shouldn't even mention exclusivity now. Also what is taking so long? Why no agreement to list on Kucoin yet? We have been talking to them since last year!


[04/13/2021 3:21 AM] Justin1000#9555
What I mention as proposed guideline from way back in Feb-15 after @mx outlined his thoughts: "I would say guideline with Kucoin should be max amount should be the lower of 1) ~120k Ergs (including listing fee + marketing + market making) - this is pretty consistent with offers we made last year; 2) ~$250k equivalent with max % possible in ERGs. So if ERG price goes up a lot then the ~$250k equivalent becomes max. BUT most important first step is getting them to agree on the framework that @mx mentioned above."


[04/13/2021 3:22 AM] Justin1000#9555
So i think we should just offer ~$200k all-in and push them to respond ASAP. If we need to we go up to $250k. And look to maximize amount of ERG. No need to mention anything about exclusivity. As far as I know they never cared about that anyway and that was suitable for last year...not now!


[04/13/2021 3:24 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti anyway you probably should have included me on the discussions from outset. this is taking way too long. is maxmillian doing anything? very important to get listed on more exchanges ASAP!

[04/13/2021 4:44 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Also especially now that the Strategic Investor has completed the deal, it might be more likely that we can get other big listings (Binance?) in the coming weeks. Could be very bad if we are blocked from doing that for months.


[04/13/2021 7:55 AM] kushti#0978
We're still doing bargain, likely listing fee will be $75-120K


[04/13/2021 7:55 AM] kushti#0978
+MM fund (refundable after some period)


[04/13/2021 7:56 AM] kushti#0978
And with no locking period


[04/13/2021 8:19 AM] Justin1000#9555
Great. Let's get it done ASAP! Time is of the essence. Need to get price and market cap up so we can get listed on other big exchanges. Noone knows how long this bull market will last and we haven't capitalized near enough yet. Marketing has improved a lot but doesn't help if we are not exchanges people use. Probably biggest bottle neck for price gains at this point in time is lack of more top 10 exchanges!

Yes. That day was just Korea. But gave up most gains next couple days. Talking to Probit. Will see what cost is. I guess I don't expect anything as dramatic as Blockstack had just by us adding Probit KRW pair but if cost is reasonable seems like a good idea to start building Korean interest given the Kimchi premium is like 15-20% now. Also, there was a guy in our telegram saying he was the manager of the Korean community trying to contact you so I sent him a DM. Maybe he can help...


[04/15/2021 3:40 PM] kushti#0978
How max can we pay for KuCoin ?


[04/15/2021 3:40 PM] kushti#0978
Changelly + Bitcoin.com  = $130K


[04/15/2021 4:46 PM] Justin1000#9555
Think Kucoin is far more important then those other 3 combined. Exchange industry very concentrated.


[04/15/2021 5:08 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 oh and actually not HitBTC

HitBTC + Changelly + Changelly Pro + Bitcoin.com = $150K


[04/15/2021 5:10 PM] kushti#0978
actually, ARRR made big movement recently, because of Changelly ?


[04/15/2021 5:24 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah I am way out of date when it comes to Changelly so maybe it could be good. But seems HitBTC has fallen a lot in rankings. And noone that I recall has asked for it. Kucoin is ranked really high on coingecko and CMC and has Ôºû500k Twitter followers and everyone keeps asking for it...


[04/15/2021 6:02 PM] Justin1000#9555
Unless someone has some interesting reasons I don't think should waste any time and money with HitBTC and Bitcoin.com.


[04/15/2021 6:09 PM] Justin1000#9555
Think exchange strategy should be Kucoin ÔºçÔºû OkexÔºèHuobiÔºèBitfinexÔºèBithumbÔºèUpbit ÔºçÔºû KrakenÔºèBinanceÔºèBinance US ÔºçÔºû regional exchanges like the ones in BrazilÔºèTurkey ÔºèIndonesia ÔºçÔºû Everyone else like 2nd tier exchanges like HitbtcÔºèBitcoin.comÔºèDigifinex etc. Don't think get much out of listing on 2nd tier exchanges at this point so leave it for the end.

"HitBTC is a Scam Exchange 

üíµ HitBTC scams by creating endless obstacles to people trying to access their funds. 

üóÑ They make deposits incredibly simple while making withdrawals incredibly hard. 

üë§ Crypto deposits never require KYC.

ü™ß When you sign into HitBTC, there is no indication that KYC is required for withdrawals. 

üì§ Their platform says you can withdraw certain amounts with no KYC. In their ToS though, they make sure to add a clause which says they might require KYC in certain circumstances. 

üì® Most users assume that they will be able to withdraw crypto funds without KYC. That is what HitBTC wants you to believe.


[04/16/2021 12:42 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
How does HitBTC scam you?

‚úîÔ∏è They delete your 2 FA code (of course, with funds on your account), requiring you to go through 2FA recovery process. This takes ages, and they require a bunch of personal and transaction info. 

‚úîÔ∏è They pretend as if you lost your 2FA device, but actually, they just manually remove it on their end. 

‚úîÔ∏è They expect a good amount of people will never be able to complete 2 FA recovery. It's a lengthy process, and their support is slow to answer.  

‚úîÔ∏è They will act like they're trying to help you, but really their entire business model revolves around wearing you out. They get a good amount of crypto to keep just from people not being able to complete the 2 FA recovery.

‚úîÔ∏è Now, 2 FA recovery can eventually be completed. It takes a few weeks, maybe months at this point. The customer will be lead to believe they are getting somewhere. 

‚úîÔ∏è The support will say they have a four day freezing period on your funds for safety, after which you'll be back to normal.

‚úîÔ∏è After the four days when you try to withdraw your funds the withdrawal will still fail.


[04/16/2021 12:43 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
‚úîÔ∏è Even if it's well within the stated withdrawal limits, HitBTC will fail your withdrawal. They won't even tell you why. You'll need to follow up with support all over again.

‚úîÔ∏è Support is going to eventually tell you that you need to KYC. They'll quote some vague legal reason and claim to be just following the rules. 

‚úîÔ∏è HitBTC is a sketchy crypto exchange in the Seychelles. A faceless organization. They are not legally required to KYC you, but they say they must.

‚úîÔ∏è They'll ask for photo ID, proof of residence, what the coins are for.

‚úîÔ∏è They ask for these things one at a time, with incredibly slow response times. 

‚úîÔ∏è They even ask for new versions of the same thing, higher resolution, higher quality, better lighting. 

‚úîÔ∏è The goal is wear you down. They will do whatever they can for you to just give up.

üö®This is how they make their money. They make their money by putting endless obstacles between you and your funds. You won't find any real people linked to the HitBTC platform."

[04/16/2021 1:11 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I think absolutely indication (but not proof) of possible and even likely scam. This is posted by "CryptoVigilante". Not sure who this is, but from their track record, it looks like they do research. I would guess that this post is an aggregation of people who have been scammed. It is not just a post by some random user. Also this would explain why they seem to have less and less users. I'm not saying that they are a scam, but with this, I would not assume they are a good exchange. I would assume they are quite likely a scam unless, otherwise vindicated.
Easiest way to do a quick check would be for you to just ask in Ergo Telegram what users think of HitBTC.


[04/16/2021 1:12 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
CryptoVigilante is (apparantly) a dedicated channel to exposing crypto scammers. If they raise a red flag, I think it is at least worth looking into.


[04/16/2021 1:13 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Maybe ask the Bitcoin.com guys about that post and what they think of HitBTC.


[04/16/2021 1:13 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
But anyhow, focus now should be on KuCoin.


[04/16/2021 4:49 AM] Justin1000#9555
HitBTC does scam. I haven't looked lately but a few years ago I know first hand they were confiscating users money selectively who didn't do KYC under the guise of clamping down on suspicious transactions. Anyway they used to be big real volume according to things like BTI.live and could maybe still support listing there especially if there are some other reasons but they have fallen a lot in the rankings and don't look like a 1st tier exchange anymore at a glance.


[04/16/2021 4:53 AM] Justin1000#9555
I thought they were asking for ÔºÑ75 to ÔºÑ120k listing fee Ôºã some amount for MMÔºüthat is fine of course. If they are asking for more I already mentioned i think ÔºÑ250k should be max including market making so could just start with ÔºÑ200k proposal if needed to see what they say. If they want even more than ÔºÑ250k then guess we would have to discuss more. Top exchanges probably will just get more expensive as time passes...


[04/16/2021 5:18 PM] Justin1000#9555
Anxious to get listed on Kucoin. Feel not being on more big exchanges is really holding price back now. After Kucoin and higher price, probably can take aim at Huobi and others...hope can agree, announce and list on Kucoin ASAP...


[04/16/2021 5:41 PM] Justin1000#9555
Looking at the ARRR price chart and the Changelly announcement on Twitter, its not obvious to me that the Changelly listing drove up the price as it appears to have been going up before then and I know crpyto vigilante has been promoting it. But the Pirate guys would know best so defer to them if it was indeed Changelly. If they think it was Changelly that helped the price then I could maybe support listing there for a reasonable price as well as Kucoin in short-term. But I think can forget about HitBTC and Bitcoin.com. Really should be focused on Kucoin.


[04/17/2021 6:15 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti Hope the Kucoin announcement is coming soon. The price is up in $s but still doing really terribly. Still 50-60 spots away in the rankings from where we were before the stable coin problems despite all the marketing. I think it is lack of top exchanges causing low price now. As soon as we announce Kucoin I want to start going after Huobi. Jinse maybe can help but lets get the Kucoin announcement done first...


[04/17/2021 6:21 AM] Justin1000#9555
People in wechat group also asking for Huobi. Saying it will boost price to $10 and even they point out that Jinse is owned by Huobi group. But since kucoin is imminent lets get that announced first!


[04/19/2021 10:45 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 likely Kucoin would be $120-150K

Not sure what role HitBTC/Changelly/Bitcoin.com played in this. They were at anarchapulco and promoted agressiely by Cryptovigilante. I note we emailed crypto vigilante about Ergo last year but no response. Guess "Ergo" is not as catchy as "Pirate Chain".


[04/21/2021 3:49 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Are there any doubts, hesitations or concerns delaying us from signing the deal with KuCoin?Are we still negotiating price with them or something else? Are we waiting to first negotiate and talk with other exchanges before singing on with KuCoin? I don't understand why KuCoin is not a done deal already by now, especially since they were ready to sign last week. It seems we keep delaying and delaying for weeks and weeks.


[04/21/2021 6:12 AM] Justin1000#9555
Hmm, maybe Kushti is under NDA or something. But yeah, does feel like taking too long! Hopefully this is a super cycle this time and we have some time but if a normal crypto cycle we may only have months not years to take advantage and getting on more exchanges like Kucoin is key part of that. Sooner we get Kucoin out of way, we can take aim at others like Huobi. Hopefully Kucoin will help the price making that easier although I don't know for sure.


[04/21/2021 9:24 AM] Justin1000#9555
USD 30k to do KRW pair on probit now. He said if this week. Wonder if we should do it. Also get associated marketing


[04/21/2021 9:46 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Sounds like a good idea to me.


[04/21/2021 9:52 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah i am thinking so too. They claim 1 million users. But I am checking with jin gazua and Monika to see what they think of probit.


[04/21/2021 10:01 AM] Justin1000#9555
Monika who helped with our Korea meetup said they are much smaller than upbit and bithumb but also much cheaper. Anything at upbit and bithumb will run into 100s of K. She implied probit was good value and worth doing. Probably would be a big step in building our korea community and positioning us for listing on upbit and bithumb later


[04/21/2021 10:01 AM] Justin1000#9555
Waiting for jin gazua. He said may survey our korean community...


[04/21/2021 1:17 PM] kushti#0978
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ @Justin1000 we are just waiting for a concrete number from KuCoin


[04/21/2021 1:19 PM] kushti#0978
They do not provide any concrete number, but talking positively.


[04/21/2021 1:27 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 very interesting what's behind Pirate Chain pump indeed.


[04/21/2021 1:28 PM] kushti#0978
In terms of exchanges, they're basically on TO + Bitcoin.com/HitBTC/Changelly(+Pro) just


[04/21/2021 1:28 PM] kushti#0978
Anachapulco was not so significant I guess. Dunno much about CryptoVigliante.


[04/22/2021 2:51 AM] Justin1000#9555
Crypto vigilante is dollar vigilante guys and those are same guys that do anarchapulco. They recommended bitcoin at a dollar. Pretty influential so they may be a big part of reason. We should try and go to anarchapulco next year but not sure I want to travel all the way there again.


[04/22/2021 2:53 AM] Justin1000#9555
I have an extremely low opinion of hitbtc but would still support listing hitbtc/changelly/bitcoin.com if waa going to help price. Not sure any solid evidence for that. Maybe if the pirate guys say it does. Only one guy in the telegram seems enthusiastic about it. In absence of any confidence will help price guess should maintain focus on kucoin then other top exchanges.


[04/23/2021 3:11 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 they offered us to share a booth, too bad we are not good in bizdev


[04/23/2021 3:13 PM] kushti#0978
It seems some old whales are pumping some coins on TradeOgre. not just ARRR, first page of TO has volumes I've never seen before


[04/23/2021 4:53 PM] Justin1000#9555
Weren't there physically. Ergo price was shit then...not surprising we didn't share the booth. Probably wouldn't have made much difference. Also its much harder to market ergo cuz use cases so broad. Privacy is just one and not enough people using the mixer.


[04/23/2021 4:54 PM] Justin1000#9555
What i am disappointed in is the lack of progress on kucoin. Think we could at least get that right after talking to them 8 months! I wrote a 5 page pdf to them last AUGUST !


[04/23/2021 4:54 PM] Justin1000#9555
Anyway I spoke to armeino on telegram. Guess he is trying to finally progress it.

The latest with kucoin is we are under priority review.

I reapplied ergo, Alex tried to shuffle our agent around but it was against company policy. We had to stick with the original agent but it seemed to make her a lot more responsive. 

Waiting for an updated offer.

With bitcoincom I am still waiting. 

I had an initial offer. I wanted to refine the terms to get ergo access to news.bitcoincom... try to get a media  pipeline thrown in. 

I have not addressed cost yet so worste case I can decline based of the efs decision.

But I figured I would try to optimize the terms for marketing.


[04/26/2021 2:34 AM] Armeanio#0321
Also I applied to https://wallet.turtlenetwork.eu/sign-in

[04/26/2021 8:30 PM] Armeanio#0321
No word yet from Yuki @kucoin other than she hopes we can find a win/win. 

With Bitcoincom our agent is still waiting for news.bitcoincom to get back regarding the potential for a longer term marketing package/partnership.

Discuss Desired Future Exchange Listings
Kushti has brought me on to help with Bizdev work. I can‚Äôt speak to any specifics as any talks are covered by NDA, but I can tell you the general game plan. I think transparency here is a good thing.  In the shorter term, my goal is to onboard a payment gateway, a larger, more accessible/trusted exchange, and continue to add to Ergo‚Äôs Dex portfo...


[04/27/2021 2:45 PM] Armeanio#0321
While I am waiting for bitcoincom and KuCoin to get back with updated offers, I have initiated the contact/application process with Kraken and OKex.


[04/27/2021 2:47 PM] Armeanio#0321
I will get the graphics from Tesseract to Carlos. I have already given info to KPTX so he can put together the announcement.


[04/27/2021 5:35 PM] Armeanio#0321
So the latest development on the bizdev side.

I have been talking with cryptocurrencycheckout.com regarding a dual listing. For 500$ they are open to listing SigmaUSD. 

I think there is greater value for any business that is accepting crypto to accept a stablecoin as there is much less potential for exposure to downside risks post sale. 

I do not believe there are many stablecoin's listed there yet. This gives us an early mover advantage. 

It is also marketable regarding stable value being used as the DeX comes online allowing businesses to purchase tokens listed on ErgoDex.

We are not yet listed on an exchange however they have agreed to tie the price to $1.00 USD at checkout.


[04/27/2021 5:36 PM] Armeanio#0321
I will need some information passed along similar to how this process was initiated as well as payment sent.


[04/27/2021 5:37 PM] Armeanio#0321
It does give the stable commercial value rather than just a short, for 500$ I think this is very attractive.


[04/27/2021 5:39 PM] Armeanio#0321
For the moment I have instructed them to proceed as originally planned pending talks to the Ergo Foundation.


[04/27/2021 5:40 PM] Armeanio#0321
The latest update from crpytopcurrencycheckout.com:

Integration typically only takes a couple days, but unfortunately the partial reason for the delay for integration was that we had to list all BPSAA members in the last week.

But because we had received your project details a week later than the other BPSAA members, ERGO has unfortunately been prioritized last in the listing and announcement phase.

We have got you mostly integrated on the back end, but it is not live yet on the front end.

Tomorrow we will get graphics from Carlos. That was pushed to him end of day. 

KPTX has prepared something for the release announcement.


[04/28/2021 5:39 AM] Armeanio#0321
If we move on payment and technical information with cryptocurrencycheckout we should be able to get a dual release of both Erg and SigmaUSD hopefully by end of next week. 

Let me know so I can update the listing agent and get Carlos started on a SigmaUSD graphic for the announcement.


[04/28/2021 5:42 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I can only speak for myself but I fully support that EF pay $500 for  cryptocurrencycheckout.com


[04/28/2021 5:43 AM] Armeanio#0321
Do you want me to put things in motion or wait?


[04/28/2021 6:05 AM] Justin1000#9555
Cryptocurrencycheckout.com using SigmaUSD seems great. And $500 isn't much. Will be great publicity for SigUSD at a minimum.

I don't have authority to say "put things in motion", but since you got 4 thumbs up above from EF members and if @kushti  is ok with it then yeah.


[04/28/2021 3:04 PM] Armeanio#0321
I put things in motion with carlos. On graphics. 

I will need some backend support from @kushti we have a little time though. 

When things have the greenlight I will see if anon2020s can install the gateways locally and play with connecting the gateway the  ergomixer. 

I think that's a good second publicity push after things go live.

I heard back from kraken, recieved a 63 page application from a list agent.  

No word from kucoin, I talked to our support agent from biki he said expect at least 7 days before an offer.


[04/29/2021 1:36 AM] Armeanio#0321
I plan on talking to draeth at pirate and seeing if there is any possibility of pitching the bpsaa to exchanges as a group for discounts.


[04/29/2021 1:37 AM] Armeanio#0321
Also carlos wants a redesign for the SigmaUSD logo before we push it more publicly. Drafts are on ergonaut on telegram.

If the Kraken application is not highly confidential, I think you could ask Orhan (in Ergonauts) to take a first pass at filling it out to save you time. In such case, still tell Orhan to keep it strictly confidential, and we'll see how he does with that. Orhan is relatively new to Ergonauts, so we should not share with him highly sensitive or confidential information.


[04/29/2021 6:05 AM] Armeanio#0321
I brought up the idea with draeth about using the bpsaa as kind of a union in negotiations to try to leverage bulk discounts for the group. 

It is something  he is on board with and is something the bpsaa will discuss moving forward.


[04/30/2021 10:24 PM] Armeanio#0321
Everything is motion with both listing for cryptocurrencycheckout. This may be complete mid next week. Graphics are ready, marketing content in motion. 

The ledger contractor has been paid, we will push an announcement Monday. Waiting on the graphics. 

Still on hold with bitcoincom and KuCoin. 

Kraken application form is filled as much as I can it has been sent to @kushti  for the technical aspects. I will keep the completed form on file for future use. 

Application approved on turtle network, gateway assistance is needed.


[05/01/2021 1:15 PM] Armeanio#0321
Our agent at KuCoin informed me we will hear more from them on May 4th. 

I heard back from the listing agent at Okex, I finished the application for Ergo today. I was told 5-10 working days is the standard review.


[05/01/2021 2:07 PM] Justin1000#9555
Great progress. Thanks for the update. All sounds good. Hopefully we can move forward with Kucoin next week. I can't know for sure but suspect we don't get more price gains on all this community based marketing because we aren't listed on more top 10 exchanges. Everyone constantly complains. Exchange volume very concentrated in the big exchanges based on our earlier research so I am not sure much to gain from listing on more small ones.


[05/01/2021 2:12 PM] Armeanio#0321
I also contacted an agent at Houbi Global, submitted some info to see if they are interested in a listing.


[05/01/2021 2:14 PM] Justin1000#9555
I met Laura from CapitalN at a conference in Shanghai a few weeks ago. They are also under Huobi's Dujun Group. They are a PR group. Apparently did China PR for Waves. Eva spoke to them and they say its US$70-80k per quarter (3 months) for them to help us with promotion. Given their connection to Huobi, I actually think it might be worth it. BUT they won't take ERGs and want USDT. Also, they wouldn't promise us a listing on Huobi (Eva was pushing them to make a guarantee there - guess that is not realistic though). So I can't say we should spend our Fiat (USDT) on this. But if @kushti or  @mx feel like it, you can check with waves guys to see if they have any thoughts on them. But again given the cost and demand for USDT probably a no-go unless others disagree. they probably are pretty good.


[05/01/2021 2:14 PM] Justin1000#9555
Also, she provided guidance on what Huobi looks for...


[05/01/2021 2:18 PM] Justin1000#9555
1) Assessment of project based on public info; 2) Team background and capability; 3) Number of users and they look at number of addresses to best assess this; 4) project potential; 5) code audit; 6) Legal letter (presumably our letter from Dentons on Ergo not a security would work); 7) public perception (any really bad reputational issues); 8) MOST IMPORTANT - enthusiasm and activity of community; 9) Fee for listing varies among projects. But might generally be 10 million RMB (~US$1.5mm) but particularly good projects can list for free


[05/01/2021 2:21 PM] Justin1000#9555
So for 1-8, we probably have a strong case to make we are already qualified to list there. If they want USDT 1.5mm though, that is still beyond our reach although maybe we could convince them to accept less. Anyway this is just guidance...good that @Armeanio is reaching out to them. @Armeanio please note in any dealings with them they are founded by a guy named Du Jun. He also owns Jinse who we are partnered with and know the CEO of Jinse well - Jinse is the biggest crypto media platform in China. And he invested in Biki which we are listed on now. So we got some significant ties into them that are worth highlighting in discussions. And can forward some of the numerous Jinse articles we have and inform them of our pretty solid China community.


[05/01/2021 2:29 PM] Armeanio#0321
I appreciate the insight with Huobi. I will keep these points in mind if we receive an application. 

If we progress to the stage where we have a conference call with Huobi or possibly Okex, I would appreciate everyone on the team in the region joining.


[05/01/2021 2:29 PM] Armeanio#0321
I understand it may be early in Ergo‚Äôs market exposure to get a decent list prices, but my hope is to get contacts as we move forward. 

Kushti was telling me yesterday that HitBtc was initially offering 50Btc for a listing at Ergo's launch, the last offer we received was 20K. 

I hope that by casting a wide net over the exchanges the Ergo Foundation is most interested in we might get an offer from one that is more attractive. 

Worst case, we initiate contact and I will keep in touch with the listing agents and periodically see if conditions change moving forward.


[05/01/2021 2:32 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yes, worse case is we make contact and get better understanding positioning ourselves better for future.


[05/01/2021 2:33 PM] Justin1000#9555
I think we would all be happy to join any calls with these top exchanges. Should be helpful.


[05/01/2021 2:34 PM] Justin1000#9555
I feel as though exchanges are top priority for the foundation. They are a hard problem requiring a lot of money and a centralized point to do negotiations so seem like the key problem for foundation to solve.


[05/01/2021 2:37 PM] Armeanio#0321
Regarding western markets I think the best plan is post waves integration, is we apply for ETH and BSC based dexes. 

BSC listings seem to be the natural long term path to Binance. 

Kraken is the first option I will apply to directly for now and see what the process/market is like in the USA vs other regions.


[05/01/2021 2:40 PM] Justin1000#9555
Okay great. Sounds like a plan. I actually feel as though Kraken maybe the single best exchange to list on right now. Could pick up huge interest from US-based investors and ADA holders if get on there. Their ethos is also great. If you get the chance and think appropriate maybe good idea to slip the Ergo Manifesto over to them when applying.


[05/01/2021 2:45 PM] Armeanio#0321
I can do that. 

So in the short term I'll get try to keep things in motion with the asian strategy, kucoin okdex and houbi.

In western markets just Kraken until waves is live. 

Also I will try to look into wallets and mining pool listings just to get some pricing for infrastructure support. 

Plus try to be more active with the bpsaa as pirate chain is getting a lot of exposure these days.


[05/04/2021 8:25 PM] Armeanio#0321
Kushti and I talked with USDC (https://www.circle.com/en/about) They are interested in creating a fiat onramp to Ergo. (Dex/Auction House Etc)

This could be a huge partnership. 

The problem is it is not possible without the Ergo Foundation being an incorporated entity.


[05/04/2021 10:33 PM] morphic#4133
I agree that having a legal entity that is acting on behalf of EF would open some opportunities. Maybe the time has come to finally create it.
But, on the other hand, Ergo is open network like bitcoin, which doesn't have foundation AFAIK. 
Do they have onramp to Bitcoin?


[05/04/2021 11:43 PM] Armeanio#0321
Bitcoin has several foundations I believe.

Incorporating is going to be an issue we run into with seeing adoption in western markets.


[05/04/2021 11:50 PM] Armeanio#0321
I think 4 jurisdictions are feasible:
Wyoming USA
Switzerland
Singapore 
Dubai

I know in the past I had emailed firms to the ergo foundation. 

I am in Colorado and could potentially be in Cheyenne Wyoming in 3 hours to handle anything there in person if needed. 

In Wyoming the 2 legal frameworks would a 501c3 educational non profit, (which has tax write off fundraising capabilities) the second would be a new LLC framework for a DAO that was created this year. 

As for the legal framework in other jurisdictions I am not as familiar.


[05/06/2021 6:03 AM] Justin1000#9555
I am concerned about putting it in a big country like the US because its possibly not neutral enough for a decentralized platform like Ergo that is really for everyone around world. Especially with US sanctioning everyone‚Ä¶who knows what will happen down the road. Maybe a small country or jurisdiction would be more appropriate although I do understand Wyoming could have some advantages so certainly not trying to rule it out. My cousin lives there now...


[05/06/2021 6:04 AM] Justin1000#9555
Bitcoin has some Foundations or at least Foundation-like entities but they don‚Äôt get any Funds from the protocol like the Ergo Foundation does. I was at Riga in 2018 during Baltic Honey Badger when the B Foundation for bitcoin was announced by some leading people‚Ä¶reaction was quite negative as people didn‚Äôt think Bitcoin as a truly decentralized block chain needed it.


[05/06/2021 6:04 AM] Justin1000#9555
Ideally we would just do a DAO and not have any legal entity. But I think it would be a huge project and team is quite busy with many other important things. So it would take some time and also not necessarily satisfy some third parties like Circle.


[05/06/2021 6:04 AM] Justin1000#9555
Caymans can be considered. I use Harneys in the BVI which is good law firm and I exchanged emails  a month or so ago regarding this topic with a Partner based in Cayman. Attached below is copy and paste from the emails from him. They can do detailed review for $2500 to $5000 specifically for Ergo before a decision to use Caymans or not if we want to look into it.

[05/06/2021 2:21 PM] Armeanio#0321
I completely understand hesitancy to the US. 

The Caymans would be an option for the ef to consider. I imagine Dash is somewhat in the same market segment regarding risk, non privacy coin with privacy features. 

Dubai has some interesting tax incentives and a lot of liquidity. 

Switzerland and Singapore are two of the more mature legal jurisdictions for crypto fintech nonprofits. Mature may be unpleasant but also may present less unforeseen changes in the future. 

That's part of the risk everywhere. The regulatory framework moving forward is unknown. It's a devil you know vs the devil you don't situation. 

The difficulty is in the US markets is I would consider most larger deals inaccessible do to a lack of an incorporated entity/liable party.


[05/06/2021 2:44 PM] Armeanio#0321
In theory if a usdc port could be brought on chain to a special amm exchange for swap with ergo native tokens ERG/Sigma it could offer significant liquidity and solve some of the fiat onramp problems ergo has at relatively low cost vs the fiat transfer via exchange route.  

In such a scenario I would recommend against a deeper integration as it would make the ecosystem more reliant of regulation.

If it is somewhat siloed (a separate/specific dex) perhaps it would mitigate structural risks if that pipeline was ever shut down. 

It's an interesting potential to consider anyway. That's up to you guys. 

I expect to hear back from kucoin tonight, no word from the other applications yet.

@deleted-role new listing proposal from KuCoin (actually, not different from previous ones)


[05/07/2021 10:24 AM] kushti#0978
Let's discuss


[05/07/2021 10:46 AM] kushti#0978
The MM part is still the tricky one


[05/07/2021 11:10 AM] Justin1000#9555
Thanks @kushti. I hope we can reach agreement and list on Kucoin ASAP as this has taken a long time.Yeah I also think MM is tricky part. I am out of my depth there but anyway...my thoughts below:


[05/07/2021 11:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
(1)    Listing Fee of US$150,000: I think this is completely fine and we can agree immediately.


[05/07/2021 11:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
(2)    Listing Campaign of US$50,000 worth ERGs: Fine and can agree immediately.


[05/07/2021 11:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
(3)    Fine in principal with the deposit amount of USDT 100k + US$100k worth of ERGs which is refundable within one year. However, I am concerned about some of the MM details:


[05/07/2021 11:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
a)    Order book maintenance: This one seems okay to me but I defer to @kushti or @mx who I think know much more than me about details of MM. The 30 minute requirement does seem very short so could ask for more time I suppose.


[05/07/2021 11:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
b)    Trading: Hard for me to comment. Volume requirement does seem high to me and I wonder if the price were to go down if the volume would be even hard to reach. Defer to others on this. If think volume requirement is too high, we should simply ask for lower requirement.


[05/07/2021 11:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
c)    Price: The English is hardly even understandable. And why should we be penalized if the price declines? Crypto is very volatile and we can‚Äôt be sure there won‚Äôt be any severe price drawdowns in the future. Think entire section should be removed.


[05/07/2021 11:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
d)    Other issues: Looks standard and fine to me.


[05/07/2021 11:12 AM] Justin1000#9555
4)    Trading Fee: I suppose this is fine. I just did a very quick calculation to get a sense‚Ä¶if use average of 0.05% and 0.02% then that is 0.035% and multipled by $200k / day volume over 365 days would be about US$25k for a year. Seems roughly okay although kinda sucks they are asking us to pay. But at this point I think getting listed their ASAP is more important then saving a bit here.


[05/07/2021 11:12 AM] Justin1000#9555
I wonder if the detailed MM requirements imply they expect us to hire a third-party for MM?

@Justin1000 yes, they expect us to run bots, by ourselves or via a 3rd party


[05/07/2021 1:07 PM] Armeanio#0321
Just woke up. 

I want to get the new and the old contract side by side and see if this is just a copy paste situation.


[05/07/2021 3:30 PM] Armeanio#0321
Essentially it is the same copy paste contract. 

30K reduction on list price. 

They did remove point 5 from V1, which was something I was not in favor of. 

We can try to further refine the terms if the price is acceptable. 

If you are willing to put in the time, work and money it's doable I guess.


[05/07/2021 4:06 PM] Armeanio#0321
For review prior to submission. Changes reflect BitmanSachs recommendations

[05/07/2021 4:56 PM] Justin1000#9555
New one looks good to me...


[05/07/2021 5:09 PM] Armeanio#0321
Glad to hear.

I know Kushti has been looking into bots, let me know how to proceed after he finishes this review.


[05/08/2021 4:56 AM] Justin1000#9555
**Exchanges**: Yes, @kushti, please review and let us know your thoughts. Want to see the effect on price of listing on Kucoin. For Ergo, there hasn‚Äôt been anything on exchanges can observe empirically. Yes, when we listed on Gate.io it had no effect but I believe that was because that was pre-hardfork and there were only 2-3 miners selling everyday and they didn‚Äôt use Gate. Also, they don‚Äôt trade much ADA‚Ä¶Kucoin much more and Huobi much more than Kucoin. Lets get Kucoin done and see the results and focus on others!! Kucoin US$121mm ADA/USDT pair last 24 hours‚Ä¶Huobi is $285mm!


[05/08/2021 4:57 AM] Justin1000#9555
**Foundation Activity**: With the price at $4 and liquidity improving, its probably time for the Foundation to do more. I see on the chats $100k sell walls are routinely getting ate through now implying we can raise more USDT if we need. I think $4 is very low and am not satisfied at all but $4 with some liquidity does imply the Foundation has some resources finally. So lets try to be more active in considering proposals and spending money. Possible things right now include:


[05/08/2021 4:57 AM] Justin1000#9555
***CapitalN**: Eva seems to think it might be a good idea to cooperate with CapitalN the guys who helped Waves with PR in China. But she hasn‚Äôt made a very good case to me yet. I will ask her to write a proposal directly to the Foundation for us to consider.


[05/08/2021 4:58 AM] Justin1000#9555
***Tango Activities**: Tango is Mr. Tan's English name. This guys is really connected and very active in crypto in China‚Ä¶already helped Ergo a lot. I think we need to officially announce him as Ambassador and give him some funds to do stuff. I think Noah has already given him some. I will just ask Eva to write a proposal regarding this. If we wait for an organized Ergo global Ambassador program to do it, might be waiting for another year as no one seems ready to step up and organize it.


[05/08/2021 4:59 AM] Justin1000#9555
***UP**: FYI, I think @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ  has already given this guy UP a lot of Ergs to for community building in China.


[05/08/2021 4:59 AM] Justin1000#9555
***Hackathon**: Leave this to @kushti but don‚Äôt be too skimpy on the rewards. Please (1) get Angie to market and organize this properly and (2) given enough Ergs in rewards that people are incentivized. I think I saw Solana having a hackathon and giving $1 million in rewards. Probably Ergo should give $100k to excite people but just giving a lot of Ergs without proper marketing and organization of the hackathon will be a waste!


[05/08/2021 5:00 AM] Justin1000#9555
**Foundation Legal Entity:** So @kushti‚Ä¶what do you think on this? Your opinion is the most important. So my questions for you right now are:
(1)    Do you agree that Dao with the community voting and onchain organization is most desirable for Ergo given its ethos etc?
(2)    But do you also agree that it is not practical in next 3 to 12 months because it will take a lot of developer and your time to think through all the governance issues, put into effect the smart contracts and fund system and educate the community? I think other things like the DEX and apps people can actually use on Ergo is more important.


[05/08/2021 5:01 AM] Justin1000#9555
Even if Dao is the best way to go but if you think not practical in short to medium term then we probably need to get a legal entity set up and then later the legal entity can pay a bunch of Ergs out to the Future DAO ZKFund when that is ready in 1-3 years. If that is the strategy we want to follow, maybe I can do some more detailed research on Pros and Cons of the jurisdictions mentioned by @Armeanio  + Cayman and we can just make a decision and move forward ASAP.


[05/08/2021 5:04 AM] Justin1000#9555
@deleted-role ‚Ä¶lets get more active in voting on proposals and deploy some funds in this bull market. Please vote when proposals are submitted. But anyway Kucoin I think is #1 priority right now so lets try to get that sorted ASAP.


[05/08/2021 5:19 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
*Up:** As per "Solution 2" in EVA's "Marketing Plan" posted in Ergonauts on 5 May, after talking with Eva a bit I just went ahead and sent the initial 2,000 Ergs to Up ("Up" is the guy's name) for community building in China (seems he will use most of those Ergs to grease the wheels of his marketing machine). It's a gamble since he could just run off with the Ergs, but Eva seems quite confident in him so we'll see how he does.

I did not send any Ergs to Tango. He said he would need around 1000 Ergs to do a one time offline promotion event for miners community. Not sure its worth doing at this point so put this on the side for now.


[05/08/2021 5:22 AM] Justin1000#9555
Sounds worth doing to me! Probably better than trusting that guy UP with so many Ergs so early. I think we should get Tango what he needs for that event. Eva can write a proposal and we can just vote and get it done.


[05/08/2021 5:25 AM] Justin1000#9555
Tango was talking to one of the very biggest and oldest miners (think co-founded F2Pool) . Tango is really connected and great things could come from him out socializing Ergo at conferences and stuff. Tons and tons of big conferences in China and he is traveling around the country attending them...especially the mining conferences. Ergo getting added to more pools is very important.


[05/08/2021 5:44 AM] Justin1000#9555
This guy UP i have never met or know anything about him. Tango I have a pretty good level of trust for and have met multiple times and has already done tangible things for Ergo. Kinda a friend already. So lets get him what he needs.


[05/08/2021 6:48 AM] Armeanio#0321
I'm in contact with Liang from f2pools I plan to call him this week.


[05/08/2021 6:49 AM] Armeanio#0321
The Kucoin amended proposal has been submitted, waiting for our agent to review it.


[05/08/2021 6:50 AM] Armeanio#0321
Also started a poloniex application. Kushti is finishing some technical aspects of the kraken application. 

Also reached out to crypto.com today regarding a listing. I'll keep trying to put options on the table in front of the ef.


[05/08/2021 7:06 AM] Armeanio#0321
With Houbi and Okex no word back yet post submission, but they said up to 10 business days.


[05/08/2021 7:09 AM] Justin1000#9555
Great


[05/08/2021 3:51 PM] Justin1000#9555
Been thinking about it. Wyoming is nice because it would probably be quick, easy and make great impression on many third parties like circle. So it certainly might be "expedient" but my feeling is US is not right at all for Ergo Foundation. Should be somewhere "neutral" including NOT China or US! So I am pre disposed toward cayman or maybe Switzerland. Quite weary on Dubai since they just started and I don't know if they will be consistent in their policy


[05/08/2021 3:53 PM] Justin1000#9555
I am actually prejudiced in favor of cayman initially because Harneys is great law firm and they can help. But also because huge number of giant hedge funds including US ones domiciled there + many many Red Chip Chinese companies (companies with offshore incorporation for parent but owns onshore China company) domiciled there as well. Should be good jurisdiction in theory


[05/08/2021 3:55 PM] Justin1000#9555
But want to hear @kushti  initial views on the questions I raised above before drilling down more and doing research.


[05/08/2021 8:15 PM] Armeanio#0321
The big question if the EF goes with Wyoming to go 501c3 educational non profit or use the new DAO LLC which is a profit framework.


[05/08/2021 8:17 PM] Armeanio#0321
Long term I think the non-profit is attractive just because it opens fundraising potential and donations/tax writeoffs as a means to refill the treasury. 

Some chose an LLC but generally they create revenue lines/generate income beyond core development.


[05/08/2021 8:31 PM] Armeanio#0321
But if another jurisdiction is preferred I have no issue. It's certainly something to look into and do a lot of due diligence about.


[05/08/2021 8:58 PM] Justin1000#9555
I don't think the Ergo EF has any place in the US. But agree we need DD on suitable locations. But firstly I still want to hear @kushti initial thoughts on all this vrs DAO.


[05/08/2021 9:31 PM] Armeanio#0321
Yeah that's definitely step 1. Profit vs nonprofit


[05/09/2021 9:58 PM] kushti#0978
" Yes, when we listed on Gate.io it had no effect but I believe that was because that was pre-hardfork and there were only 2-3 miners selling everyday and they didn‚Äôt use Gate" - gate.io started to shine with liquidity provided via grid trading.


[05/09/2021 9:59 PM] kushti#0978
Listing per se could be worthless, and was so with gate (nowadays miners support would make it in different way for sure).


[05/09/2021 10:20 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ @Armeanio we have now $80K collected on Biki and Bitmart, we can sell a bit more via OTC and got on Changelly + Changelly Pro + Bitcoin.com also, what do you guys think ?
I think Changelly would be especially nice, as Yoroi already has "Buy ADA" button powered by Changelly, and we can have "Buy ERG" button as well.

[05/09/2021 10:22 PM] Armeanio#0321
Ease of market access has been one of the constant complaints. A buy now button I think would go a long way to solve that.


[05/09/2021 10:40 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 @Armeanio I think incorporation is needed now indeed. I am okay with any option. Switzerland is too expensive though I guess.


[05/09/2021 11:09 PM] Armeanio#0321
This is up to the members of the Ergo Foundation. I have no vote. Here I can help, elsewhere it is more difficult. I did provide you a list of firms. You have the Caymens option as well, @Justin1000 can put this is motion.  

I can resend this list of firms if needed.


[05/10/2021 12:46 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
No comments from @kushti or @mx  on Kucoin application so I guess it's ready for EF to vote on? Let's finalize Kucoin ASAP.


[05/10/2021 2:09 AM] Justin1000#9555
I guess Kucoin is just a matter of time. Can vote when they come back on our revised proposal.


[05/10/2021 2:12 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti Seems good to me if you want to go ahead on Changelly and Bitcoin.com. I originally didn't want to do it because of the expense and also the time it would take from you and I wanted to focus on kucoin first. But the price and liquidity are up a lot so expense is not an issue and I guess you are best judge of spending your time. Also of course I think changelly would be nice to have.


[05/10/2021 3:52 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Has this been submitted to Kucoin yet? I guess its ready to go since no further comments from @mx or @kushti


[05/10/2021 4:57 AM] Armeanio#0321
With kucoin we are waiting for the formal agreement. We have refined the terms. Kushti needs to look over the mm aspect they are asking for.


[05/10/2021 4:58 AM] Armeanio#0321
They accepted the changes in terms. The mm requirements are the issue at the moment.


[05/10/2021 5:00 AM] Armeanio#0321
With bitcoincom/changelly I have an otc erg sale lined up as a potential way to pay for it.


[05/10/2021 5:01 AM] Armeanio#0321
If we can get a commitment from Emurgo to build in a "buy erg" button into yoroi, I think that's a relatively large news event to capitalize upon.


[05/10/2021 5:05 AM] Armeanio#0321

[05/10/2021 1:48 PM] Armeanio#0321
Sorry for the delay here. The agent has proven to be a bit incompetent and quite slow. 

We stated the changes we wanted for price concession, were told we will proceed to the formal agreement and none of our requests were reflected in the formal agreement.

The devil is in the details, I will keep pushing for change in the formal agreement.


[05/10/2021 2:05 PM] kushti#0978
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ @Justin1000 hopefully we can start voting tomorrow. I can convert BTC into USDT by that moment


[05/10/2021 2:05 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ so what about Changelly + Bitcoin.com in parallel ?


[05/10/2021 2:11 PM] Armeanio#0321
I have a potential otc agreement lined up that may fund this listing (changelly  bitcoincom)

Let me know if this is something to pursue.


[05/10/2021 2:11 PM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti Changelly + Bitcoin.com sounds fine to me. I am positive on Changelly because it offers a new way for people trade Ergo and the button mentioned by @Armeanio is really exciting. I couldn't care less about Bitcoin.com...as mentioned many times before, the exchange industry is very concentrated and another 2nd tier exchange offers little additional benefit as far as I know. But I recall there was some liquidity connection with Changelly...so that could make Bitcoin.com good. In any case, we have the funds now and seems Kucoin is proceeding so if you think Bitcoin.com is desirable lets go for it! I still consider Kucoin the MUCH higher priority though so lets prioritize that if needed.

üëÜ 

[05/10/2021 2:16 PM] Armeanio#0321
@kushti any word from the yoroi team? Maybe we should create a group chat try to get a commitment to build the buy now button.


[05/10/2021 2:16 PM] Justin1000#9555
Well this OTC topic is one we discussed many times in the past. I think the general conclusion has been it is okay to do OTC trades but probably would only bother with them if it is too a high quality investor. And in my opinion price is still low with lots of upside catalysts in near-term so we shouldn't sell any more than needed and we have some USDT now. Also, we are able to just sell on market and don't necessarily need OTC now days. But if the investor is high quality long-term holder and can bring something to table besides just funds, then that would certainly be worth considering.


[05/10/2021 2:18 PM] Armeanio#0321
No I would not say it is a high quality investor. If fundraising is not needed in the short term I agree there is a better trade off in waiting.


[05/10/2021 2:19 PM] Armeanio#0321
I just wanted to line that up in case short term liquidity is an issue. I am not aware of the current budget tbh, so I figured best to put that option on the table if needed.


[05/10/2021 7:50 PM] Armeanio#0321

[05/11/2021 5:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
Well this contract is not well drafted in my view. But probably need low expectations for such contracts in this industry.

I guess they just pull the 60% number for deposit reduction out of the air. I am not sure MM can be done so perfectly for so long that there would never be any breach of this giving them the opportunity to take 60% of the deposit. However, probably doesn‚Äôt make sense to ask for lower number as there is no basis for that number either. And hard to believe they will actually take our deposit for minor ‚Äúbreaches‚Äù. So I guess can leave as is.

Price: I still don‚Äôt like this section. I don‚Äôt see us being responsible for the price over long-term. Even when investment bank does IPO, they only do stabilization activities for 30 days and also don‚Äôt make any guarantees about price. Not to mention the language isn‚Äôt even clear. But the edits you made certainly help. Guess can leave it. Again seems unlikely to me they will really try to take our deposit for minor ‚Äúbreaches‚Äù of these MM terms.

So I think we can just go with this if others don‚Äôt have issues.

Tango has written what he has been working on and required ERGs. Doesn't look like he requires many ERGs for now but once I have the detailed Ambassador proposal for him from Eva, will put it to a vote. Among other things he is talking to F2Pool core team - @Armeanio you might consider letting me know who your speaking to their so I can tell Tango. He is doing a bunch of other things including talking to a mining equipment maker about making mining machines that mine both Chia and ERG and doing some Ergo events.


[05/11/2021 7:12 AM] Armeanio#0321

Bitcoin/Changelly/Changelly Pro will take 100% usdt or 50/50 Erg/usdt. 

Let me know which is preferred and I will try to get a formal offer. 

Kushti has recieved informal support from the new Emurgo/Yoroi team to build a Buy Erg button into Yoroi.


[05/11/2021 7:18 AM] Armeanio#0321
I have sent the edited copy of the Kucoin contract to @kushti. He needs to sign it and we can submit. 

If they accept, hopefully we can accelerate the payment and release news of the listing shortly thereafter.


[05/11/2021 7:40 AM] Justin1000#9555
Sounds great on Changelly/Bitcoin.com and Yoroi button. 50/50 ERG/USDT is best. 

Will just let Tango know you are talking to Da Liang so he is aware.


[05/11/2021 7:41 AM] Armeanio#0321
I'll let them know, hopefully I can get a formal offer before eod tomorrow.


[05/11/2021 7:51 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Armeanio FYI: Tango says any specific agenda you have with F2Pool you can let him know and he can also push. He sat down with I think their co-founder at a conference 2 weeks ago and was already pushing Ergo and will be talking to their team on ongoing basis.


[05/11/2021 8:19 AM] Justin1000#9555
FYI: I am doing some simple high-level analysis of different Foundation locations that might be useful for stimulating further discussion so we can drill down on the best location. Hopefully can finish and circulate relatively soon and we can discuss...


[05/11/2021 11:48 AM] Armeanio#0321
This would be good, it's not right imo that kushti is directly exposing himself to liabilities with exchanges. I did the same with kucoin to get it listed.  

It is better to have a legal structure there as a legal buffer.

It may be an issue with bitcoincom/changelly we will see.


[05/11/2021 4:23 PM] Armeanio#0321
All relevant documentation has been submitted to bitcoincom. We should receive a formal contract from their legal team shortly. 

A signed contract had been submitted to kucoin and is pending approval.


[05/11/2021 5:35 PM] Armeanio#0321
I'm going to get Carlos started on graphics. It would be good to start lining up annoucements/content to push. 

I asked for maximum discretion on his end .

[05/12/2021 8:59 AM] Justin1000#9555
Above is very prelim overview / brainstorming of the possible Foundation locations suggested so far. Some of it is rough and preliminary but in interest of time just circulating anyway. After this exercise my thoughts below:


[05/12/2021 8:59 AM] Justin1000#9555
*Wyoming: I started with this one and became more positive. Can definitely see some big advantages. But after thinking about it more and looking at the locations, I remain doubtful Wyoming is right. 
-On other side of planet from current Foundation members
-I continue to think that putting it in US gives a signal Ergo is US-oriented when in fact is totally global and distributed. Maybe not a huge concern but something of issue for me at least
-The US is massive country with changing approach toward crypto and I don‚Äôt know where it is going in future. Yes, Wyoming does seem very positive and probably will be consistent in approach but I am more concerned about national policies
-Before putting it in Wyoming we would need to be comfortable US regulations and reporting requirements would not dissuade anyone from around the world from joining the Foundation as we might have future board members from pretty much anywhere. US has very independent set of regulations‚Ä¶probably any American would be fine but I am not sure about international people ‚Äì this is probably my biggest concern with Wyoming‚Ä¶


[05/12/2021 9:00 AM] Justin1000#9555
*Caymans ‚Äì remains a front runner in my mind. I have a Fund based in BVI that Harneys advises. Its very easy and low maintenance and I never have to go there and they almost never bother me for anything. I assume Caymans is quite similar and this is a big plus for Ergo Foundation. I think we have low tolerance for dealing with bureaucracy and third parties etc.


[05/12/2021 9:01 AM] Justin1000#9555
*Singapore ‚Äì this looks really interesting actually. Dentons Singapore team gave us legal opinion on Ergo not as a security and so I have asked them for more info. Tons of Foundations and crypto companies based there. I guess my biggest initial concern is our total lack of physical presence there so will have to see what Dentons says on that.

*Dubai ‚Äì Not sure about this one. Put some stuff in the sheet however.

*Switzerland ‚Äì Quickly put some basic info in sheet. But seems we are not too keen on Switzerland as Kushti thinks is likely expensive and the last thing we want is to deal with a lot of troublesome third parties and shifting requirements that Harneys alluded to.

So probably next steps are:

-Get info from Dentons on Singapore (have emailed them already)

-Consider whether to get Harneys to do the ground work on Cayman. Cost $2500-5000 for this. But makes sense to do ASAP if we think Cayman could be a top contender. Harney says 4 weeks to set up Foundation there.

-Wyoming ‚Äì leave it to further discussion among people here. I see some big advantages but currently to me the concerns I mention above outweigh those 

-Dubai / Switzerland ‚Äì Switzerland seems unlikely. Dubai I am a bit out of my depth. Think we would need to talk to someone really familiar to quickly get to know the ins and outs.


[05/12/2021 9:04 AM] Justin1000#9555
Other matters:

*Tango Ambassador proposal and associated funding now submitted for voting. 

*Coinex is doing really good on ERG trading and the community has been encouraging lots of people to go buy there. I wonder if it is good time to ask them again about other areas of cooperation like 1) ViaBTC mining pool; 2) Via Wallet; 3) eventual listing of SigUSD ?

*Probit: Likely USDT 30k for listing a KRW:ERG pair. Not sure how people feel about this but once I get the revised bullet point proposal from Probit, I am just going to submit it for a vote. I think I support it myself and will outline briefly why in the proposal.


[05/12/2021 11:43 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 I asked about ViaWallet and ViaBTC, ViaWallet may be doable on observable future


[05/12/2021 11:44 AM] kushti#0978
@deleted-role are we okay with Changelly + Changelly Pro + Bitcoin.com for 120,000K USDT, 50% in ERG ?

But that was like a month ago. Think we should remind them how much volume and users we gave them just recently and ask them about this again. Should try and capitalize on this benefit we have given them. Anyway worth a shot I think...i think i will go ahead and do that in the telegram...

it would be good if Kushti doesn`t say anymore in that channel that BCH is dead üôÇ


[05/13/2021 6:32 AM] Armeanio#0321
Signed and submitted the bitcoincom changelly application, waiting for the counter sign then we will proceed with payment. 

Kucoin application is signed/submitted still under review due to changes.


[05/13/2021 6:37 AM] Armeanio#0321
A small mining outfit leafpool is setting up an erg pool for free. A community member asked me to contact them. 

Miners also pointed me towards a few others. 

I contacted ethashpool no word yet. I plan to contact ethermine tomorrow.

The main large pool I will focus on will be f2pools.

Probit regarding KRW pair listing. I guess I won't pursue it anymore or put it to a vote unless anyone here wants me to. They seem quite rude to me. But if anyone thinks this is worth doing can let me know and we can vote on it. Looks like $30k + 0.2 BTC as per the pic. They claim some new regulations this week which will make it harder in future.


[05/13/2021 11:06 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Let's put the KRW pair listing to EF vote. Seems worth doing.


[05/13/2021 11:41 AM] Armeanio#0321
Probit seems to have no liquidity or value imo. 

Kucoin and bitcoincom have both reached the point of payment. 

Kucoin has accepted the contract.


[05/13/2021 11:55 AM] Armeanio#0321
Countersign from Kucoin expected in 1-2 days.


[05/13/2021 12:03 PM] Justin1000#9555
I talked to Monika before who set up our Korea meetup. She said Probit was pretty good for the costs. I am unsure and on fence but probit might work for establishing some presence in Korea at a low cost.


[05/13/2021 12:04 PM] Justin1000#9555
Will try to get upbit contact from her. She said she had it. She said upbit and bithum many X more expensive than probit. Possibly we could afford them now though.


[05/13/2021 12:19 PM] Armeanio#0321
Hopefully with these two listing the market presence of erg will go through a shift, open some doors for us moving forward.


[05/13/2021 12:19 PM] Armeanio#0321
I have no vote in the matter, I just noticed their volume is terrible.

[05/13/2021 2:22 PM] Justin1000#9555
Probit KRW Pair would be a cheap easy way to start getting some exposure in Korea as we are listed on Probit already. They could do AMA + Newsletter to 1 million people. But maybe best to go straight for Upbit and Bithumb.


[05/13/2021 2:22 PM] Justin1000#9555
@Armeanio When/if you think appropriate you can reach out to Bithumb at listing@btckorea.com (provided by Monika)

You can consider cc‚Äôing Monikablockdiver@gmail.com -> Monika moved to Lisbon now but she helped us a lot with our great Seoul meet up in Sept 2019 (Kushti talked there).


[05/13/2021 2:33 PM] Armeanio#0321
Sounds like a plan, I will put things in motion.


[05/13/2021 2:47 PM] Armeanio#0321
For 30k I believe we could probably get a few pairs listed on biki. 

Pairs to consider include. 

SigmaUSD/erg
SigmaRSV/erg
SigmaUSD/usdt
SigmaUSD/usdc


[05/13/2021 3:19 PM] Justin1000#9555
I think all of those Biki pairs would be great.

[05/13/2021 9:27 PM] Armeanio#0321
I can push this with Biki fairly easily at lost cost I believe, this is definitely ERGs most friendly agent. Let me talk with him and see.


[05/13/2021 9:35 PM] Armeanio#0321
I told him to pitch a dual listing to his superiors. 

Sigmausd/usdt
Sigmausd/usdc

For 30k let's see if he can make that work.


[05/13/2021 9:40 PM] Armeanio#0321
That would be the first opening for other stables to move into ErgoDex


[05/13/2021 9:57 PM] mx#5165
different stablecoins enable market makers to basically "mix" their fiat liquidity and withdraw usdt as something else, also they contribute to usdt survival at the same time


[05/14/2021 4:47 AM] Armeanio#0321
Graphics are in for bitcoincom. Waiting on the countersign and payment.

Great!


[05/14/2021 5:04 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Should we space the public announcements by at least a week or?


[05/14/2021 5:32 AM] Armeanio#0321
It depends when bitcoincom allows us to push this.


[05/14/2021 5:32 AM] Armeanio#0321
It's kind of set by the exchange I just wanted to line things up so we are prepared.


[05/14/2021 5:33 AM] Armeanio#0321
Push it everywhere get maximum exposure.


[05/14/2021 5:33 AM] Armeanio#0321
Kucoin I think will take a bit they are unreasonably slow with most things.


[05/14/2021 5:36 AM] Justin1000#9555
Probably should just push all out as soon as the exchanges allow. Understand on Kucoin and expected but that is one most keen to push out because its long overdue and I want to show the community we respond to their requests. So earlier we can get the Kucoin announced the better!


[05/14/2021 5:37 AM] Armeanio#0321
Right now we are stuck waiting for their cosign, as soon as it is in we can send payment but are on their clock again for release details.


[05/14/2021 5:38 AM] Armeanio#0321
Hopefully the turnaround for the news release is quick, they estimated 1 month before erg goes live.


[05/14/2021 5:41 AM] Justin1000#9555
Okay. Sounds good. I don't think we can do much about it. But if you think appropriate you may push them a bit on announcement and listing date. Afterall Ergo is really hot right now so maybe they will want to move faster than usual.


[05/14/2021 5:42 AM] Armeanio#0321
I'll do my best to accelerate things, honestly my hope for that is a bit low just based on experience but it doesnt hurt to try.

Well with the price blowing up...the legal entity is becoming even more urgent. If we are not ruling out Cayman and are undecided still on location, I will probably 1) Pay Harney's to do that assessment; 2) Ask Dentons to respond ASAP regarding Singapore. I am not keen on Wyoming as mentioned before but I think still open minded if those concerns are addressed...also if everyone else thinks we should go with Wyoming then I guess I wouldn't object too much. Just doesn't seem like best location to me for reasons I mentioned.


[05/14/2021 8:45 AM] Armeanio#0321
Just recieved the countersign from bitcoincom


[05/14/2021 8:55 AM] Armeanio#0321
@kushti the invoice for payment is in your PM in telegram. The relevent USDT addresses are there for payment.


[05/14/2021 8:56 AM] Armeanio#0321
Just heard from Kucoin their countersign documentation is not ready yet. 

I was told 1-2 business days this morning. So that should come soon.


[05/14/2021 2:29 PM] Armeanio#0321
I think it's something to pursue. The where is up to you guys at the ef.

I am curious what options 1 and 2 say. Both seem like decent options.


[05/14/2021 5:18 PM] Armeanio#0321
Pirate/komodo guys from the bpsaa recommended I connect with a market maker they use for larger tier 1 exchanges. 

Just got off a call, will recieve documentation Monday.

It seems like a good partner to have in the bank as we move toward exchanges that recommend/require this.

@Justin1000 on ProBit, the problem there is liquidity. After the fork, miners send more there so situation is slowly improving, but still, with no MM we can't do much there it seems


[05/15/2021 4:21 AM] Justin1000#9555
Okay. Yeah I was wondering about that aspect actually. I guess we will forget about Probit then and focus on bigger things. Thanks.

Regarding legal entity, I have held off on getting Harneys to do the VASP assessment for Ergo. Based on email exchange with Dentons, Singapore sounds more promising and quick. But Dentons has been slow to do a call to clear up details. Looks like call will happen no later than tomorrow though so hopefully can get some clarity ASAP.


[05/18/2021 10:54 AM] Robert K#0722
Moving this from internal EF chat:


[05/18/2021 10:54 AM] Robert K#0722
In that vein, I do think it is important now also to hire more people who can actually take work off of Alex's shoulders and writing job descriptions to make that happen rather than just conversing about it.
Though I'm not sure if we have anyone who would like to potentially take that up?


[05/18/2021 10:54 AM] Robert K#0722
It seems it'd be good to have:
- Someone to deal with node/wallet support for exchanges
- (Not sure if everyone will agree with this) A general project manager to keep tabs on all of the projects and is able to coordinate everything as needed, and act as a unifying force between content creators/writers & the devs while making it easier to make roadmaps and so forth
- Someone for administrative purposes especially as we approach incorporating (can also function for talking with new partners potentially)


[05/18/2021 10:56 AM] Robert K#0722
I currently have my hands full with setting up a new company myself, doing all the administrative work, and hiring for key positions, which is why this is on my mind, but also why I don't particularly have the opportunity to help out internally atm here.


[05/18/2021 12:19 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674

With bitcoincom, changelly, changelly pro we are waiting for the list date, all relevant media is ready to push once we have the greenlight.


[05/18/2021 3:39 PM] Armeanio#0321
With kucoin we wait for their legal department to countersign. I believe payment is lined up to push as soon as I hear back.


[05/18/2021 3:40 PM] Armeanio#0321
I can take the call with circle/usdc this week.

I would appreciate some update to pass along.


[05/18/2021 4:20 PM] Justin1000#9555
I mentioned above a brief update. Doing call with Dentons tomorrow. Singapore seems promising but only based on email exchange with Dentons...lot of details to clear up. Incorporation can be done in as little as 2 days but the more common and likely much more preferred approach for a Foundation limited "by Guarantee" takes 3-4 weeks in Singapore. But this is quicker than Cayman which would probably take 4-6 weeks and needs some initial assessment by Harneys before starting. Maybe its possible to move to set up some intermediate entity really quickly and move to the more preferred structure later...need to check with Dentons.


[05/18/2021 4:20 PM] Justin1000#9555
Will have more update tomorrow after call with Dentons...


[05/18/2021 6:01 PM] Armeanio#0321
Completely agree.

I hope the EF can figure this out. 

It would help tremendously to have teams organized and deployable when/where needed. 

If I could get a node/wallet/mining pool/exchange support team on standby that would be of great assistance.


[05/18/2021 7:48 PM] mx#5165
yes, very important to improve each department and make them growing, another problem is that all these people, including new devs, need a learning process, similar like people from exchanges


[05/18/2021 8:05 PM] Armeanio#0321
Yes I Imagine it is a process. I know Kushti had mentioned a director of education for devs. 

Lately people have been sending me CV's I just tell them I will review it and if there is any opportunity I will let them know. 

If the EF does incorporate idk if the structure will be for profit or nonprofit. 

Either way it would be good to create an operational framework for departments/roles.   
I do think it would be good to see Kushti juggling a lot less, get a support system in place behind him.


[05/18/2021 8:18 PM] mx#5165
yes, lots of tech ideas to be added to Ergo still, new research and lots of support issues could be sorted by wallets like Electrum etc, full node from NXT, but it takes time also


[05/18/2021 8:21 PM] mx#5165
with latest exposure, grants should be more visible so hopefully lots of devs will get aboard


[05/18/2021 10:51 PM] Armeanio#0321
Coinomi wants 140k for integration split between erg and other assets. 

I had a call with cFund (investment arm IOG) they want to invest in 100k erg @5$ a token. This had been discussed prior to the current price run. 

Their offer is a potential market/marketing access and further potential partnership with IOG. I have been told I will recieve business development support with exchanges and wallets.


[05/18/2021 10:52 PM] Armeanio#0321
This and circle/usdc seem like partnerships to pursue imo. 

If we can get everything organized in house and incorporate. It is a viable path forward to many of the goals you mentioned when you brought me onboard.


[05/19/2021 12:10 AM] mx#5165
anyway it is not POS ico, there was one exception per marketing provided, i would keep them personally waiting for few weeks from now and discuss max 20% discount next


[05/19/2021 1:08 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Agree with @mx , 10% ~ 20% (max) discount to market price at the time of signing seems acceptable.  Larger discount might be warranted for very early stage project, but by now Ergo is mature 1) not only in terms of the tech (arguably more so than most/all top 10 coins), but also 2) at least to some extent relative to a month ago, the market cap, which is more and more likely to continue increasing as, arguably, ERG has already reached the Ergo Singularity.


[05/19/2021 1:13 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Since it seems it would be great to have cfunds as an investor, hopefully they can move fast and invest before ERG reaches $100 and more. With ERG price higher now, there is less "small cap" risk compared to a month ago, so still a good deal for them (in terms of risk / reward ratio) to invest at 10% discount to current market price.


[05/19/2021 2:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
I strongly support getting CFund in as investor but I think $5 is off table now. We have to reference the current market price to large degree. Perhaps we could justify an up to 20% discount to current market given price has risen so quickly.


[05/19/2021 4:59 AM] Armeanio#0321
Sounds good to me.


[05/19/2021 5:00 AM] Armeanio#0321
I will put things in a holding pattern with cFund see where we are in a week and offer a 20% discount


[05/19/2021 5:11 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I think it's "cFund" not cfunds or CFund. I'm worried if I keep seeing it incorrect it will stick in my head that way.

[05/21/2021 11:46 AM] Justin1000#9555
I have been meeting a bunch of people face-to-face in China at conferences. Not surprisingly, third parties, exchanges and investors all seem much more interested in Ergo now that the price ramped and community is growing rapidly. I got an intro to Huobi head of listing from the Jinse CEO and I tried to meet her yesterday at a conference in Shanghai. But she blew me off so I failed miserably. Hopefully this is because they are ready to move forward with listing Ergo and don‚Äôt want to have unnecessary conversations and not due to them being negative on Ergo. Anyway, have a look at the above doc and let me know if anything is of particular interest.


[05/21/2021 11:46 AM] Justin1000#9555
We also pushed Okex this week and my friend who recently joined them has been following Ergo for sometime. But she is not in the listing department.


[05/21/2021 11:47 AM] Justin1000#9555
Keeping my friend at Bitfinex updated. I can write to Henry again and cc CEO and update them on all the progress.


[05/21/2021 11:48 AM] Justin1000#9555
As writing the above, it occurs to me we should seriously consider attempting to get in more professional investors with sales from EF. For example if CFund decides to come in, we could consider proposing investment at same terms to Chainup, Seven O'clock and Redline. This is IF we think they are good and IF we need additional USDT.


[05/21/2021 11:49 AM] Justin1000#9555
I am not sure they will come in because Ergo is higher valuation and more advanced than they normally do but probably worth considering.


[05/21/2021 11:49 AM] Justin1000#9555
They all sounded interested in learning more when I spoke to them. not easy to find high quality projects to invest in this industry!


[05/23/2021 1:32 PM] Armeanio#0321
Market price with a 20% discount is getting closer to cFund's ask, 5$

Would the EF allow cFunds to lock in that rate if market price falls to $6.25?


[05/23/2021 2:38 PM] mx#5165
if it helps to speed up the deal or make a deal at all, this time window could be used for sure


[05/23/2021 4:37 PM] Armeanio#0321
Thanks Martin I'll get in contact with David from cFund and try to line it up.


[05/24/2021 4:53 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yes. Turns out we could very much use the funds if price drops so I do advocate the sell to CFunds at $5 if price drops to $6.25 or lower. But for the record, I think its a bit difficult to justify normally a 20% discount after the price has fallen. In this case, it would be an exception because CFunds is such quality investor, we need the funds and liquidity seems to have indeed fallen. But price may not drop there so CFunds should consider raising their target price >$5 if they want to close the deal ASAP.


[05/24/2021 4:31 PM] Armeanio#0321
I agree, I was brought into the discussion after it had been ongoing for a few weeks. 

I am not sure how long that proposal I mentioned has been on the table.


[05/24/2021 8:39 PM] Armeanio#0321
I talked with usdc today. There is a way to get their apis connected to the ergo auction house that circumvents kyc requirements. 

Essentially you could look at it as users being able to use credit/debit/fiat from banks to purchase auction credit. 

One could view it as giftcard. It is not fungible on other aspects of the chain, aside from the resale of the asset purchased.

 It is somewhat of a closed loop, but this enables integration without the licensing requirements. 

It is possible to onboard greater functionality but to be honest it comes with stricter requirements that I think are best avoided.


[05/24/2021 8:41 PM] Armeanio#0321
From a standpoint of adding liquidity to the auction house it seems attractive.

Once you cross the barrier of getting fungibility on chain the complexity, paperwork, liabilities regulatory issues increase exponentially.


[05/24/2021 8:49 PM] Armeanio#0321
Now an interesting theoretical usecase...

NFTs that would are redeemable in tokens. 

Idk if that is ERG, a stableswap, perhaps and ICO launch, but it is an interesting way to make "giftcard credit" convertible/fungible.


[05/25/2021 8:07 PM] mx#5165
please send this info to @anon_real and ask if he is interested


[05/25/2021 9:03 PM] Armeanio#0321
He said he is interested.


[05/25/2021 9:20 PM] mx#5165
so usdc would want some grant? auction house if fully being created and deployed by anon_real so hard to say what kind of partnership above some grant would be possible here


[05/27/2021 2:15 AM] Armeanio#0321
We have 6 exchanges in motion
3 mining pools integrating. 

I am working with Emurgo to develop a roadmap for the Ergo side of yoroi. 

I have been in contact with Joshua Miller business developer at IOHK
(ex personal assistant to Charles H) 
regarding potential research partnerships. 

I have not heard back from cFund yet. Will make contact tomorrow. 

Most of this is just conversation or autopilot so I'm going to be rotating to focus on helping put together the hackathon with Angie.

Usdc has yet to mention any grant or fee. I think the nft market is their way fo growing their exposure and they collect some fees.

So far I just wanted to explore possibilities to see if a partnerships is even possible and haven't focused on price.

 I dont think fees or grant's are an issue just technical integration but I will confirm this.

Agreed, I think we should pursue other potential investment partners such as Chainup, Seven O'clock and Redline. Also https://www.threearrowscap.com/ and https://www.defiance.capital/ might be good partners (although I don't know anything about them other than that they are big in crypto).

cFund would be great, but we shouldn't just sit and wait for them and hope that they will invest on favorable terms; better for us to be more proactive looking for alternatives, which could also give us more bargaining power with cFund.

We don't need to decide now whether to pull the trigger, but I think it would good to now at least start conversations with other potential investment partners to determine if we think they might be good partners. And even if we don't partner with any of them, starting conversations with them now would have the benefit of making them aware of Ergo, and so they might start researching Ergo and later become more interested.

CFunds should make a decision. Crypto is always crazy so will never be a "right" price.


[05/27/2021 4:40 PM] Justin1000#9555
I think the foundation is in a bit of a bind. On one hand I think we really want Cfunds in but on the other hand we need to be able to justify the entry price to the community if they ever ask (probably unlikely in crypto but still...) so the 20 pct discount mentioned by MX seems max to me given current higher liquidity.


[05/27/2021 4:45 PM] Justin1000#9555
I sent 3Arrows a email last year. No use it seems along with the 50 to 100 people we contacted then (guess ergo "too small " at time). Anyway sent them another email today after seeing Noah's message. Probably pointless but FYI. They are huge. Zhu Su has 200k followers on Twitter and is a billionaire or close to it i think.


[05/28/2021 8:46 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Armeanio FYI: our China Ambassador..Tango...previously was talking to F2Pool about adding Ergo. I told him we had separately been in contact with them on our end but didn't tell him any details. Anyway, the boss there just told him that they would not add Ergo right now because was still too small and too low of hash rate but they would add later when this changes. They also told him we had sent email so guess he is talking to right person. Not sure if can read much into this but FYI.


[05/28/2021 8:56 AM] Justin1000#9555
He does say they really like Ergo though. And think will be a top choice for GPUs if/when ETH moves to PoS.


[05/28/2021 2:44 PM] Armeanio#0321
I will keep in contact there I think after we get some better exchanges it will be more interesting for service providers and investors. 

In the meantime we have some other pools working with mhs_sam. F2 might take a little time but I think its doable. 

I'll try to get on the phone with Liang this week. We had not spoken recently, last I heard it was in review and he made it sound positive.


[06/07/2021 10:22 AM] Justin1000#9555
Let me know if I should keep trying to chase Huobi. A guy at Huobi contacted me. Not listing department though. But I can try pushing anyway.


[06/07/2021 2:48 PM] Armeanio#0321
My thought is we wait until kucoin is listed I think that may improve our market position. I was planning to put things in motion post listing.


[06/07/2021 2:49 PM] Armeanio#0321
You can definitely keep pushing anyway.


[06/07/2021 5:07 PM] kushti#0978
@deleted-role should we aim for more wallets? If so, Coinomi can be a good choice (integration cost is ~$100-140K)


[06/08/2021 12:36 AM] Armeanio#0321
@kushti I will see if I can get exodus to give us a quote. I know they generally integrate larger chains but they are also in business to make money so let's see if we can get a side by side quote. Compare it to coinomi.


[06/08/2021 2:27 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah we could really use more wallets as too reliant on Yoroi right now.


[06/08/2021 4:58 PM] Armeanio#0321
Coinomi is a good option that we could move on in the short term if desired.  We could be getting ERG / Ergo Tokens / Ledger / Changelly support


[06/09/2021 7:21 AM] Justin1000#9555
I have never used them but Coinomi looks good to me from their website:
*SegWit enabled
*Emphasis on privacy
*DeFi ready they claim
*DEX integration and cross chain transactions enabled within their wallet they claim
*Presume we would get on a mobile wallet with them
*Support for tokens like ERC-20, Tron tokens etc so hopefully no issue for them to support Ergo tokens

I would suggest in the conversations with them, putting early emphasis on:
*Ergo token support (not just ERG but all Ergo tokens or all major ones at least)
*Ergo DeFi app accessibility.
*In-wallet transfers through their DEX partners
Think important to discuss these things upfront rather than later. Because now Ergo blockchain still a bit quiet but that will hopefully change dramatically soon and they should be ready to integrate apps and tokens.


[06/09/2021 7:53 AM] Justin1000#9555
FYI: Going to ask Eva to apply to Huobi again via this guy Ricky who contacted me on Wechat. We actually applied to Huobi in early March but they said our liquidity and community were too small but obviously this has improved big time. Think we keep pushing. He just sent me an application (think is same one we filled out in early March)

[06/09/2021 2:58 PM] Armeanio#0321
I can do that so far we have discussed native tokens, ledger support, and changelly support. 

I have not discussed their DeX partners. 

Exodus does not appear to interested for now. 

I think we should proceed with coinomi. 

Can the ef vote on coinomi?


[06/09/2021 3:10 PM] Armeanio#0321
Sounds good. Post the current listings that are in motion kushti and I will finish the kraken application. I will reapply to a few others exchanges, mining pools as well. 

Any progress on the ef incorporating?


[06/09/2021 3:26 PM] Justin1000#9555
Slow progress. Was delayed to internal discussion but just preliminarily decided to go with Singapore. Lawyers have been notified and are starting process (waiting for them at moment). If things go smoothly than should be done in about a month.


[06/09/2021 3:28 PM] Armeanio#0321
That lines up well with the exchange listing we should be live and see improvements in liquidity by then.

 I do think this will help open doors in western markets. Offer some legitimacy. 

The kraken application is 80+ pages vs  kucoin was about 10-12.

They are just subject to a lot more oversight.


[06/09/2021 3:29 PM] Armeanio#0321
I've been focusing on the hackathon this weekend, we put it together last minute attracted 30+ participants so far.


[06/09/2021 3:33 PM] Armeanio#0321
Kucoin does offer an p2p OTC trading area what may be interesting as a tool for the EF in any future otc deals. 

Talked with a few investment groups nothing interesting to report so far. Changes in the markets recently seemed to spook investors. Maybe with the recent development in el salvador this will shift market sentiment.

[06/21/2021 8:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
I am not sure what we are considering in terms of market makers but since I met Redline at a conference and have had follow-up conversations with them, I at least wanted to inform everyone so you can consider it going forward. 

They are not being too specific at this point but basically it is USDT 7,000 per month for market making. The exchanges they typically work with are: Binance„ÄÅHuobi „ÄÅOkex„ÄÅBitmax„ÄÅBitmart„ÄÅKucoin„ÄÅBibox„ÄÅBetaex„ÄÅCoinw„ÄÅLbank„ÄÅMxc„ÄÅBigone„ÄÅBiki„ÄÅZbg„ÄÅZg„ÄÅHotbit„ÄÅCcfox„ÄÅAax„ÄÅFTX (they invested in FTX)


[06/21/2021 8:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
They said the smaller exchanges not worth their involvement. I am assuming that for the USDT 7k / month, we would only be able to use them for 2-3 of these exchanges (subject to confirmation and discussion!). So could make sense to get them involved for bigger ones like Binance, Huobi, Okex , Kucoin perhaps.


[06/21/2021 8:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
Admittedly I do not know them well but seem like a solid group with traditional finance background.

Building relationship with them could have additional benefits as they offer a bunch of other value add services. These are meant to be paid for separately but perhaps could get some for free. They include:


[06/21/2021 8:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
1„ÄÅIntro to exchanges (they have good relations with above)
2„ÄÅMedia releases
3„ÄÅCommunity introductions
4„ÄÅListing tokens on websites
5„ÄÅIntro to summits/events for activities
6„ÄÅOnline broadcast and offline roadshows
7„ÄÅÈáèÂåñÂ¢ûÂÄºÂíåÂ•ó‰øùÊúçÂä°„ÄÇ (not sure what this is‚Ä¶probably quantative trading related)
8„ÄÅWallet app and exchange tech development

To be clear, I am not advocating we work with them yet but providing this info for your consideration in case we are in discussions with any other market makers or will be soon.

FYI: Seems they don't have interest to invest in Ergo. I think it is just because advanced stage Ergo is at already.


[06/21/2021 5:14 PM] Armeanio#0321
I spoke with the manager of an investment fund incorperated in Florida last week, they wanted too large of a discount to be realistic. Plus offered no marketable benefits.


[06/22/2021 4:07 PM] Armeanio#0321
I have been more focused on the Ergoversary this week. 

I have a conversation ongoing with the project manager of Edge wallet, as well as an email in to the project manager of exodus. 

I also have directed a list agent at Kucoin to go knock on the door at Okex and see if we can get a quote.


[06/22/2021 4:56 PM] Justin1000#9555
Okay. Thanks. Sounds good. Haven't heard from Huobi. Guess I could chase but seems like bad timing. 

I don't know how others feel and I am not sure how much USDT we raised so far but maybe time to touch base with CFunds see if they might want to invest given price is closer to their target although they may not want to catch a falling knife.

Bad time lately...terrible market and not much news flow or developments from us. But as far as I know everyone is still working hard and things are on track.

@kushti#0978 we aren't pursuing coinomi?


[06/22/2021 5:33 PM] Armeanio#0321
We have an offer from coinomi. I was trying to chase down another just so we have options.

[06/22/2021 5:34 PM] Armeanio#0321

In the process of getting a quote on Edge Wallet. 

Applied Ergo to WarizX. My contact at Kucoin is going to set up a group with the agents there.

 ‚Ä®‚Ä®I was put in contact with Javier Sim at Bithumb, they are not interested in ERG at the moment. ‚Ä®I do have a contact with Okex but at the current market position and market access they are not to interested in listing ERG. 
My plan was to just wait until the current listings go live and then see if this changes their perception.‚Ä®‚Ä®I  have been told that for listing on bithumb, okex, and huobi you need at least $5 Million volume daily and 200 Million+ in market cap. Unless you are willing to get taxed heavily for access this is not a good idea. 

‚Ä®‚Ä®I can push for a listing quote on any of the following quite easily if the EF is interested.‚Ä®‚Ä®

Bittrex 
‚Ä®Bitmax‚Ä®
Binaryx‚Ä®
ZB
‚Ä®Liquid

‚Ä®‚Ä®I have been talking with an agent at ZB, they require a Market Maker. I pinged Ryan at Kairon Labs, previously when we spoke with them they were a bit overwhelmed and looking to add staff. No word back yet.

‚Ä®I also received an offer from MXC, I have been talking with an agent there on and off for about two weeks. Trying to slow play them to get a lower quote at the moment it is about 75k. 50k listing fee plus 25k marketing tokens.

I have also been talking with a few contacts about wallets that are popular in the Asian Market. I was recommended Math, PocketTocken, and Bitkeep. I was going to reach out to Eva, Justin and Noah soon to get their thoughts. 

‚Ä®‚Ä®I also have started the process of creating a potential educational partnership with https://armath.am/en/resources‚Ä®‚Ä®This is a tech incubator that works with teaching adolescents and college students. The majority of students speak Russian from birth. I spoke with Kushti about the potential of hosting a workshop. He was onboard as it is not that far from his current location.  This is relatively recent so nothing to release yet. I think the marketing as well as entry into a market that is known for depth in tech skills would be a good potential partnership.

Let me know how to proceed and I will put things in motion with any of the exchanges listed above. 

Regarding Edge I am waiting for a quote. With Exodus they do not seem to excited to do business at the moment.


[06/29/2021 2:09 AM] Armeanio#0321
MXC is up the EF. I had heard Eva was quoted 60K at one point so I see no reason to pay 75K.


[06/29/2021 2:10 AM] Armeanio#0321
I want to apply and get a price from WarizX, this is already in motion. I will bring the list price here once I know more.


[06/29/2021 2:11 AM] Armeanio#0321
I am also in the process of lining up additional potential marketmakers since Kairon is slow.


[06/29/2021 1:04 PM] Armeanio#0321
Reached out to a different market maker. This is often required at larger exchanges to ensure liquidity on order books. It may be needed for kucoin as a portion of our fee is refundable if we meet liquidity requirements. 

Here is the initial response. Let me know if the EF wants me to proceed in getting more details and potentially line this up for Ergo. 



What can I say in terms of market analysis:

CMC + overview:
1. Your main markets are CoinEX + Gate USDT trading pairs - significant organic liquidity amounts exist there
2. Your liquidity numbers are also doing well, but there are some points to improve: Gate ETH + Probit USDT and ETH
3. Since you are a project from top 150 - I suggest increasing volumes just to show Grands (Huobi/Bithumb Korea/Binance maybe KuCoin that you are ready for being listed there)

Don't want to expand now on the full service list, but want to say that our core difference between other top market makers is that risk management is vital in our vision.

Also, while we generate revenue for you - we ask to reinvest part of those funds back in the orderbook to have more influence on the price and Market Cap

Strategy:
1. Of course I will propose working on all three exchanges I mentioned: 
CoinEx, Gate, Probit - we will be able to control the price, implement effective buy out strategies and cashout
2. To conduct the exact needed strategy I need more info from your side - but I suppose your goal is to become top 100 project and list on Binance/Huobi/Bithumb Korea or Bitfinex (If you want to target USA markets)
3. Best short description: Creating ressuply strategy -> buy selling some part of your tokens, you will take 60% of the revenue and 40% will come back on MM accounts to implement additional uptrend in price and increase capitalization
4. Of course, increasing volumes and liqudity placed in active tradinng zone (2%,5%,20%) and further creating bid pressure on key price levels.


[06/29/2021 1:04 PM] Armeanio#0321
Looking forward for your comments and suggest making a call to discuss what I outlined above
What do you think, Armeanio ?


[06/29/2021 1:10 PM] Armeanio#0321
If we do set up market making I would recommend we cover gate, kucoin and changelly. 

Coinex already has user based liquidity pools so it is not needed.


[06/29/2021 2:37 PM] morphic#4133
Hi, I'm not sure I got Strategy 3) and 4) points, what that means? 
Another question, we need to sell ERGs monthly to cover EF spendings, it would be great to have some automated service to do that.
The way I see it, we have a trading bot which can be configured by setting 1) bottom sell price, 2) ERG amount and 3) trading period (e.g month). The bot then use DCA strategy to sell ERGs automatically and accumulate USDT.
I wonder if market makers can provide something like that?


[06/29/2021 2:38 PM] Armeanio#0321
Generally market markers can raise funds yes. This particular one I have yet to speak with regarding the full scope of services offered.


[06/29/2021 2:42 PM] Armeanio#0321
It appears 3 has to do with a resupply trading scheme. Essentially recycling a certain percentage of profit to provide further liquidity. 

4 appears to concern the distribution of liquidity based on resistance levels. This is generally a relatively common trading strategy. 

I will get additional information.


[06/29/2021 3:00 PM] morphic#4133
Ah, that makes sense, thanks, looking forward to more info on this. We definitely need MM for kucoin as far as I remember.


[06/29/2021 3:01 PM] Armeanio#0321
I'll try to get the info in front of the EF in the next day or two.


[06/29/2021 4:06 PM] Armeanio#0321
Would it be possible to get email addresses to forward the Market Makers information to?

[06/30/2021 6:44 PM] Armeanio#0321
I had a meeting with the market maker Coinls.

My initial proposal was to start on a trial basis for the Kucoin listing. The initial fee for one month of service is 4,000 usdt. 

@morphic They do offer cash out management services, so the EF can use them to cover expenses. 

Access to private investment firms if that is of interest. 

My thinking is we give them a test run, and see if we can negotation the fee upon the completion of the first month. 

I think this way they will have already invested time/energy and will be more likely to be accomodating to not lose a client.


[06/30/2021 6:55 PM] Armeanio#0321
I know kushti is not getting a salary from the EF at the moment. 

However I would also like to propose a one time budget expense for an at home professional studio for kushtis interviews/erg related promotional videos, consisting of the following. 

A labtop that doesnt make noise üòÖ
A high definition external camera
A tripod for the camera
A professional desktop microphone 
Passive light(s)

I would be happy to pick out the necessary equipment if needed.

@Armeanio You may consider looking into listing on Mercado. As mentioned I don't think we should waste time with 2nd tier exchanges but regional exchanges that get Ergo exposure to certain regions would be big exception. Ergo is popular in Brazil I understand. 2 days ago I was talking to a Columbian at a crypto meetup and he had been to and Ergo meetup in S. America (I think Brazil). He was very keen on Ergo once I told him about LETS and all the other stuff it can do. Possibly we could leverage our community in Brazil to get on Mercado and grow S. America further...

Was delay on our end at first...then the Partner at Dentons got sick post Vaccine. Then we approved the payment to them...now waiting for them to send us an invoice.


[07/02/2021 5:53 AM] Justin1000#9555
So I have been sending emails pushing and calling etc. Just left a voicemail with him.


[07/02/2021 5:53 AM] Justin1000#9555
Its a bit frustrating. But hopefully this will finally be on track ASAP. A plus with Singapore is we can have pre-incorporation contracts that Kushti can sign. So probably will suffice for what we need before entity set up.


[07/02/2021 5:54 AM] Justin1000#9555
I will try to get it started ASAP and get a schedule from the lawyers so we got some comfort this will actually be getting done in a reasonable time frame. Was expected to take 4-6 weeks when started.


[07/02/2021 6:11 AM] Armeanio#0321
One difficulty at the moment is 2 of 3 market makers I have talked to are located in  Russia.

The 3rd is not taking on new clients at the moment and has us on hold pending new staff. 

Kushti can't sign anything personally in Russia without taking on massive potential liabilities. So absent a corp any service there is toxic.  

I'll see if I can find another one that is available, it seems most services in the crypto space are feeling adoption pains atm. It's why the listings with exchanges are taking so long. 

The counterparty liability this type of service is going to have different implications than an exchange listing. 

To meet the liquidity/market making requirements the EF may lose some of the collateral that was put down.

I'll keep knocking on doors and see if I can find more options for a  MM.


[07/02/2021 6:19 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah, don't think Kushti will want to sign in Russia. What about Redline? They seem keen to work with us and are China-based.


[07/02/2021 6:26 AM] Armeanio#0321
Redline is an option we are a bit short on time.

I have one more MM I can get in contact with.


[07/02/2021 6:26 AM] Armeanio#0321
I'll start that discussion tonight.

[07/02/2021 7:41 AM] Armeanio#0321
I'll get more details tomorrow. @Justin1000 can you reach out to redline and get a quote for their mm service on 1 exchange covering 2 trading pairs.


[07/02/2021 7:47 AM] Justin1000#9555
Will check. Denton's just wrote back and apoligized. Turns out Partner missed my email and another one of their team is on leave. Hes said can get started by mid next week and has provided a payment address. So probably things will get underway now...


[07/02/2021 8:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
For Redline they can do USD 5k per month if we pay quarterly. This is apparently for a specialist to market make. For bots would be ~2k per month.


[07/02/2021 8:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
So can consider using them. If they are too expensive but expedient could use them 1 quarter than replace them or potentially get a much better deal with them if add more exchanges in that quarter.


[07/02/2021 12:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
Looks good. 

For the sake of @kushti's back I hope he's not sitting at that couch all day. A proper height-adjustable desk + ergonomic chair will go a long way

[07/02/2021 1:55 PM] Robert K#0722
Probably the best plan. I imagine the first quarter will be the most important as they will pay attention a lot shortly after listing, but after that probably more lienient


[07/02/2021 1:56 PM] Robert K#0722
And I'd personally be also fine to spend EF funds to get Alex some better equipment if he's able to situate it all himself


[07/02/2021 3:02 PM] Armeanio#0321
Redline is coming in significantly cheaper than BTX. 

I am not familiar with any of their services, but I imagine its somewhat standard between MM's

 If all looks good I would say have the EF retain their services for a quarter, directing them towards both pairs at kucoin.


[07/02/2021 3:02 PM] kushti#0978
I can look for some professional studio maybe


[07/02/2021 3:02 PM] kushti#0978

Not willing to sign more agreements personally for sure, can be risky

It looks like the budget request I put forward has been approved, did you review the list?


[07/02/2021 5:04 PM] glasgowm#9381
Not sure if this is the right chat for this - but did the EF vote on some arabic community manager? (https://t.me/mohamd_arabic). Says he's been waiting on the result of a vote for payment


[07/02/2021 5:05 PM] glasgowm#9381

i think it is the same group running both communities, or even the same man as they look very similar, i was paying both accounts personally, very poor quality long term, for Arabic they want now 2500$ monthly so i guess similar answer as Kusthi sent to Armenia, that he can pass ownership if he wants and stop asking for money

[07/07/2021 7:12 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Armeanio Been talking to Redline. Seems Kucoin has screwed us on the MM requirements. The trader at Redline says the entire order book maintenance requirements should be deleted as no way to ensure that. He says can keep the volume requirements and maybe just make a few tweaks to the price requirements.

[07/07/2021 7:13 AM] Justin1000#9555
They provided this basic contract so far and requested us to fill in an information sheet which I have asked Eva to do. Then they want to do a call with me but he was very clear first on the above issues with Kucoin requirements.


[07/07/2021 7:14 AM] Justin1000#9555
I am not sure when we will be in a position to sign this document. We have started things with Denton regarding Singapore but I think could easily be another week or more before we are in a position to utilize those Singapore pre-incorporation contracts.


[07/07/2021 7:15 AM] Justin1000#9555
Redline should be trustworthy but I have never dealt with them before so can't say for sure.


[07/07/2021 7:18 AM] Justin1000#9555
"*If there are technical issues such as exchange server down, the trading chart
must be maintained to be consistent at 15min and 30min level with no clear
breaks. If there are any chart breaks on 1 min or 5 min level chart, it must be
fixed within 30 minutes." -> this needs to be deleted too he says


[07/07/2021 12:00 PM] Justin1000#9555
@Armeanio you may consider showing the market making terms to a few of the other guys you are speaking to just to get a second opinion. If they all say the same thing as redline then 1) we know the terms are indeed unfair and not market standard and 2) have more leverage to ask  kucoin to change (although i guess we already payed listing fee so not too much leverage here unfortunately )


[07/07/2021 4:24 PM] Armeanio#0321
I will talk to the other market maker, see what they can do.


[07/07/2021 4:36 PM] Armeanio#0321
I was told this was in regards to servers going into maintenance mode, which is essentially when deposits/withdrawals are suspended and trading isn't halted. I would think a mm would be running with a portion of reserves held on the exchange. 

 The flexibility of these terms was difficult. I did make some favorable changes, and that was a large part of the delay. 

I'll see what the other market makers take is in the terms.


[07/07/2021 4:52 PM] Armeanio#0321
I will ask our agent at kucoin if there is flexibility.


[07/07/2021 5:16 PM] Justin1000#9555
I have a pretty favorable impression of redline from interaction i have had so far but obviously it has been limited. They say that exchanges normally ask for unreasonable things up front. Could be that since we had not already been working with a MM we didn't have enough confidence about what was acceptable or not. Anyway yeah...please check with the others for their thoughts to extent possible. Thanks

[07/08/2021 7:03 AM] Justin1000#9555
Okay. The Redline guy says:
*Order book maintenance fine in normal conditions but not when exchange price is crashing
*The technical issues part may not be big problem but these things should not be written in the contract. Too onerous. 

I don‚Äôt think he is confident can meet these requirements in all circumstances. 

@mx please let us know if you might have any thoughts on this.


[07/08/2021 9:26 PM] mx#5165
it should work with any new market maker and help of existing market makers from other exchanges, community and new people using only exchanges like Kucoin, different order books are also used many times by competition for different purposes, not mentioning attacks on specific pairs globally where potentially all coins break their official terms, i doubt any single market maker would sign such contract with Kucoin directly(it comes from some regulatory experience, maybe stocks exchange?) so rather teams just say yes we will fulfill terms and see what happens next


[07/09/2021 6:39 AM] Justin1000#9555
So you mean your not surprised that strictly speaking Redline doesn't think the terms are fair and they may not be able to fulfill them in extreme market wide crash circumstances but if they are really a competent market maker we should probably try with them and have them do their best?


[07/09/2021 10:24 PM] Armeanio#0321
Do they have any projects live on kucoin?


[07/10/2021 10:24 PM] mx#5165
by looking at the huge list of coins on Kucoin they rather don`t care about quality but try to secure some superb guarantees from each side, still won't help them much or their customers in case of some new hack or another disaster, two new market makers don't hurt, doesn't need to be just one, they will still compete with each other


[07/10/2021 10:27 PM] mx#5165
they should worry about any circumstances, not just in crash cases


[07/10/2021 10:38 PM] Armeanio#0321
Any idea whats going on the network? Seems congested, the mempool is filling up, but block txs are low.


[07/10/2021 10:46 PM] mx#5165
probably transactions assembly procedures need to be optimized finally, Kushti was to look at it in his non existing free time, pragmaxim is helping with issue, such events are usually good for speeding up fixes


[07/10/2021 11:07 PM] mx#5165
use 0.002 fee for example if you want tx to move quickly so lots of hanging are most probably invalid


[07/10/2021 11:08 PM] mx#5165
so in reality mempool isn`t overloaded


[07/10/2021 11:16 PM] mx#5165
can be some exchange generating lots of invalid ones or just smart guy having fun


[07/12/2021 9:03 AM] Justin1000#9555
They say they did it for 20 projects on Kucoin over a 18 month period but their answer implied none live now on Kucoin. They said have done MM business for more than 3 years.


[07/12/2021 3:28 PM] Armeanio#0321
Sounds good. I have an other MM that is a possibility but the terms are not as competitive. 

Applied to Mercadobitcoin and am under review. Had a Brazilian community member collect all the Brazilian/portugese content so hopefully that helps. 

For the most part on hold until we list on Kucoin to see if that changes our market perception with exchanges. 

Still talking to Liang at F2 trying to get them to onboard an Erg mining pool. 

Also lined up a potential partnership nonprofit that runs tech incubators working with adolescents and college students. They are interested in offering courses in UTxO and Ergo. They have 600 labs worldwide. Still early will have a call with them this week to see what they would need to make that happen.

I am not familiar with the classifications of non-profits in Singapore is the Ergo Foundation pursuing some equivalent framework to the USA's 501c3 educational nonprofit? 

If so I am hoping we can create the first non profit partnership, then decentralize the courses/concepts and onboard as many of these types of organizations as possible. 

A nice marketing narrative should be built in, it opens an organic pathway for future developers and over time could make hackathons or other Ergo events have a lot more reach.

[07/13/2021 9:14 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think you can give a try to amend those Kucoin MM terms and say redline our chosen market maker requests this. Probably they will say no. In which case I am unsure of best course.  We could just go with redline and ask them to do their best but they don't seem to confident. 

If the other one you have is confident then we could try them instead even if more expensive. 

I guess the partnership should be fine. But will ask dentons.  Sounds great anyway...one of my chief concerns is how we get more developers on ergo as we can't just  get solidity devs to move over because it is so different.


[07/13/2021 11:57 AM] glasgowm#9381
On devs, the Hackathon was great and brought in a bunch of people. I've went through all the community developers and there's a fair bunch that are active. (See Community Developers here - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JeTIh9dKHLtJmR5y1wdzxrZ5Rp4PYvRIVPqtozVY0l8/edit?usp=sharing)

Also went through and reorganised the dev tools list - https://github.com/ergoplatform/awesome-ergo/blob/master/pages/devs.md - From my perspective (no blockchain experience but plenty of CS experience). The pathways are still a bit unclear. Main things needed are clear, simple tutorials that help visualise ergo's eUTxO so people can get their head around it - and idiot-proof tooling. Think we can build up a lot of that over the next hackathon(s) and also using the `grow-ergo` repository. 

On that & the special ops budget; I've just started publishing drafts based on the bounty file rates and a bit of guesswork

https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/issues

Am I ok to make these live & figure out what's best to spend funds on with the community or what's the procedure here? I've made a `Special OPs` tab here to log spending/proposals.

So if needed we can enlist their services. @Justin1000  What is the current state with Redline is their an offer we can compare side by side?


[07/14/2021 2:30 PM] Justin1000#9555
Redline is the $5k per month if quarterly so $15k for first quarter


[07/14/2021 2:35 PM] morphic#4133
Will it cover both kucoin and gate.io exchanges?


[07/14/2021 2:37 PM] Armeanio#0321
Is running an MM on gate.io of interest as well?


[07/14/2021 2:38 PM] Armeanio#0321
I might need an updated quote if this is the case. 

The second question would be do we want to cover all trading pairs or just USDT?


[07/14/2021 2:38 PM] morphic#4133
I don't think this is a requirement, rather nice to have.


[07/14/2021 2:40 PM] Armeanio#0321
Ok I will have it quoted a few different ways and let the EF see which is potentially  attractive.


[07/14/2021 3:38 PM] Armeanio#0321
Quotes fomr CoinLS:

Kucoin MM covering all trading pairs.

1) full-service package at KuCoin exchange (all pairs included) / month - 4000 USDT 
2) full-service package at KuCoin exchange (all pairs included) / 3 months  - 11000 USDT
3) full-service package at KuCoin exchange (all pairs included) / 6 months  - 20000 USDT

Kucoin +Gate.io MM covering all pairs.

1) full-service package at KuCoin + Gate exchange (all pairs included) / month - 7500 USDT 
2) full-service package at KuCoin + Gate exchange (all pairs included) / 3 months  - 20000 USDT
3) full-service package at KuCoin + Gate exchange (all pairs included) / 6 months  - 36000 USDT


[07/14/2021 9:00 PM] morphic#4133
Thanks, I don't think it worth to pay additional 16K usd to MM on Gate since we don't have obligations there. 
Are they ready to take responsibility for fulfilling the Kucoin requirements of MM?


[07/14/2021 9:03 PM] Armeanio#0321
Yes, they said they can handle the requirements.


[07/14/2021 9:04 PM] Armeanio#0321
I would think month to month initially is a good choice for a new service.


[07/14/2021 9:09 PM] morphic#4133
yeah, agree.


[07/14/2021 9:10 PM] morphic#4133
Are they ready for some penalties, in the case they cannot handle?


[07/14/2021 9:29 PM] Armeanio#0321
I can see.


[07/14/2021 9:29 PM] Armeanio#0321
I'll let you know.


[07/15/2021 2:19 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
@glasgowm it looks great to me, and glad you're willing to do this! If no objections or comments from anyone else here within the next 24 hours, then yes, you can make the budget live. Normal process would be that you pay out the periodic payments out of your own funds and then ask @kushti for total reimbursement in one shot at the end of each month (or if anyone else here has another view please speak up now). Keep in mind that the total special ops budget is US$20K per month, so keep an eye on how your spending is adding up (might want to give a weekly or bi-monthly update here on the month-to-date total).


[07/15/2021 2:25 AM] glasgowm#9381
Cool thanks - yeh kushti said he'd look over the repo too. Plan to start small - think the translation one may be too ambitious as it seems everyone wants to do one lol


[07/15/2021 6:35 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Armeanio No change for Redline if we add Gate.io so sti 5k a month.

They seem to think most likely can handle the Kucoin MM but think there is serious risk and the request is very unreasonable. 

Probably they are capable but more conservative but I am in no position to vouch for them as haven't worked with them before. 

So I suppose if you have a pretty good feeling from CoinLS we can go with them. Maybe try redline out at some other point to give them a shot.


[07/15/2021 6:36 AM] Justin1000#9555
FYI: Dentons says no issue to do that non profit partnership. Probably you can start talking about the idea more to that group. Sounds like really good initiative to me.


[07/15/2021 8:56 AM] morphic#4133
"... the request is very unreasonable." maybe they can give their own "reasonable" version of the agreement or suggest which specific parameters can be changed (increased/decresed/removed) so that the overall requirements become realistic and they can fulfil them?


[07/15/2021 2:00 PM] Justin1000#9555
Well they already said what they didn't like. Mentioned above somewhere. It is most of the requests from Kucoin.


[07/15/2021 2:06 PM] Armeanio#0321
I set up a call with this nonprofit group for tomorrow to estimate what exactly  is necessary on our end before we proceed with anything.


[07/15/2021 2:09 PM] Armeanio#0321
With redline I've been asking market markers I have contact with, exchange agents that take projects to kucoin and have access to contracts and the project operations manager at kucoin. 

So far I don't have any confirmation of their complaint or discrepancies vs other projects. 

I do know that initially the largest point of contention before signing was these terms and I was able to get some changes to the terms.


[07/15/2021 2:11 PM] Armeanio#0321
I will attach the feedback I got with the most depth. 

Kucoin is currently integrating and it appears so far their wallet dev needs some hand holding. It could be a single party that is a little incompetent but it is in a group chat with other Kucoin members.


[07/15/2021 2:12 PM] Armeanio#0321
From another MM 

- Checked with our account¬†managers - KuCoin doesn't track liquidity in the orderbook - suppose that 30k deposits will be enough.¬†
- Even if situation when KuCoin start tracking this and start asking questions - we will adjust - because exchanges make 2 warnings before exact penalties
- KuCoin provides reduced trading fees - but MM account need to have 100k USDT - you can ask about this directly your listing manager or we can also ask our contacts
- Another info for your interest - KuCoin has iceberg orders inside - means that sometimes we wouldn't be able to track highest asks¬†and lowest bids

In simple, there will be no penalties from KuCoin side - even if they will we will easily prevent them.


[07/15/2021 2:13 PM] Armeanio#0321
I will have another conversation with the project operations manager at Kucoin based on the various feedback I've recieved and see what she has to say.


[07/15/2021 2:16 PM] Armeanio#0321
Do we know the classification of non profit that Dentons is pursuing in Singapore?


[07/15/2021 2:19 PM] Armeanio#0321

I spoke with the project operations manager at kucoin the collateral the EF provided wont be touched without a warning and time for our market maker to adjust.


[07/16/2021 6:40 AM] Justin1000#9555
That is good news. Maybe that would alleviate Redline's concerns. We could consider getting Redline on both Kucoin and Gate.io. Redline are asking me to go to their office for a face-to-face visit. I could do it next Monday. Then we could make a final decision.


[07/16/2021 6:45 AM] Armeanio#0321
Sounds like a plan. 

I think whoever the ef decides to proceed with, a short term trial period is the way to go. 

Once there is a sense of the quality of service etc then consider a longer term contract.

[07/16/2021 6:47 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah. If they mess up then we can get someone else and seems Kucoin won't be so quick to take our deposit which is good. So maybe go with Redline and keep CoinLS in back pocket or other way around. I will look to meet Redline next Monday and report back on impressions from meeting. They got a office in Pudong Shanghai...probably pretty nice. Guess I can meet with their team.


[07/16/2021 6:50 AM] Armeanio#0321
Personally I think having a partner you can get physical facetime with is preferred.


[07/16/2021 6:51 AM] Armeanio#0321
Whats the mood on the ground with this latest crpyto/mining crackdown?


[07/16/2021 7:07 AM] Justin1000#9555
Not sure how bad it is. Guess I will find out next weekend as going to a big conference in Hangzhou. But one ominous news saw yesterday was Â∏Å‰∏ñÁïå (Bitworld) a crypto media group similar to Jinse but smaller shut down because of the government/central bank concerns.


[07/16/2021 7:13 AM] Armeanio#0321
Unfortunate to hear. I guess that's a macro risk to gauge and pass along. I know I am curious.


[07/16/2021 7:15 AM] Justin1000#9555
Well my personal view below from ~3 weeks ago. Don't think it has changed (yet).
*China has been researching Bitcoin and crypto since at least 2013 and has a very good grasp of it. There are probably different views in the government but generally guess they recognize its not going away and could be important technology for China in long run.

*But they are concerned about the scams, mindless speculation and possible disruption to the financial system. To be honest, I think we all know the vast majority of non-BTC alt coins are total garbage and so China doesn‚Äôt lose much to reduce speculation in these among its populace

*Mining was unregulated and using electricity they decided could be used elsewhere. I heard the ability of China now to get the cheap electricity from hydropower into the cities is better so mining is just taking away from this and bad for China‚Äôs reputation too. Also, I doubt they view much happening with the mining as being ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù as its just about cheap electricity and cost control

*China is rolling out its Digital RMB. They probably aren‚Äôt keen to have distractions right now

*China is extremely innovative now and is surging ahead in many technologies. But given the disruptive nature of crypto, I think the government has determined that they don‚Äôt want to lead innovation in this space at all and want the innovation and disruption to be abroad for now

*I don‚Äôt think China loses much by these measures. They can wait for a lot of the innovation to happen abroad and just invite the miners and integrate the technology back into China when they and how they see fit


[07/19/2021 10:03 AM] Justin1000#9555
Went to their office and met with Becky and Ethan at Redline for more than 1.5 hours. Becky was my original contact. Ethan says is head of trading and market making.

Indicate even last year were doing around US$30bn+ of MM trading volume per month and should be much higher now.

They do MM directly for exchanges and currently are one of the MMs for Huobi, Binance and 10+ other exchanges. Was MM for Kucoin doing 18 main coins like BTC, ETH, LTC etc but not anymore. Team for MM is tens of people including people based around the world. Think they said Kucoin wasn‚Äôt paying enough or something so don‚Äôt work for Kucoin anymore.

For projects they are do capital management/MM for dozens of projects. Team is 10+ and based in Shanghai.

Besides MM they can do other stuff like promotion. They also are partnered with Jinse and have been able to push articles for free sometimes. They have 100k followers on their Weibo.

Didn‚Äôt think Kucoin would help us too greatly by itself and thought incremental buying may only be $100k or so from listing there so very minimal. However, he seemed to reconsider when I mentioned the significant ADA trading there and ADA-ERG user overlap.

Royalty amount: This is 15% of the increase in USDT and derived from sale of tokens and MM profits. I may need to clarify further exactly how its calculated for sale of tokens. I think we can set guidelines on how many tokens we want to monetize if any.

They said they can meet the terms for Kucoin as others can but just think the request is not fair or favorable for Ergo so raised the concerns. They generally use algorithms and API for MM and have 24 hour monitoring and would respond quickly if there was a problem.


[07/19/2021 10:03 AM] Justin1000#9555
Account security: Said they would not be able to withdrawal from account. Just conduct trading activities.

Sounds like could sign with individual. They use offshore company for these.

Need 1 week notice for Kucoin so they can do some testing and also fit in their schedule as have a lot of projects.

Seem quite keen to help us. Probably if this works out we could expand our relationship with them. I suggest we can try using them for Kucoin and Gate but do suggest maintaining a good relationship with the other MMs @Armeanio has talked to so we can quickly replace if Redline doesn‚Äôt turn out to be good for some reason. I guess I didn‚Äôt see anything super compelling or exciting about Redline but no red flags either so probably they are competent.


[07/19/2021 1:49 PM] morphic#4133
This sounds good, so let's proceed with Redline. Also worth to have a backup plan with the other MMs.


[07/19/2021 2:48 PM] Armeanio#0321
Sounds good. I'll keep in touch with other MMs. 

Kucoin has been working with Ilya and Kushti on wallet integration.


[07/20/2021 12:03 AM] kushti#0978
I think we can combine grid trading + time trading on gate.io + professional MM on KuCoin


[07/20/2021 12:04 AM] kushti#0978
Let's discuss tomorrow how to move forward

{Reactions}
üëç 

[07/20/2021 12:09 AM] Armeanio#0321
Just let me know what the consensus is with proceeding in case I need to do anything on my end.


[07/21/2021 6:51 AM] Justin1000#9555
In last day, was speaking to Redline about the agreement. The 15% royalty fee is highly unreasonable in my opinion. Basically seems they would get 15% of the increase in USDT balance in the account. So if price went up and they sold some ERGs, they would get 15% of the profits. From talking to them, this seems to be in relation to "market value management" which is using MM strategies to boost the price and they would want 15% of the profits in event they were able to do that. But its impossible to say the price went up because of their efforts and not because of some external factor so seems unreasonable. 

Anyway, we discussed and they agreed to remove that for now and focus strictly on fulfilling the MM requirements and not ‚Äúmarket value management‚Äù. 

Later after working with them for a while we can revisit this and consider working with them on market value management as well.

They will amend the agreement and resend. Not sure how we are going to sign that. 

@Armeanio let me know if indication on when we will finally list on Kucoin? Redline said wanted 1 week headsup. Also maybe let me know how we should maintain contact with Redline as a team and if we should get them on with Kucoin too or maybe not needed. I can check if they are on Telegram‚Ä¶probably‚Ä¶also their written English at least seems good.


[07/21/2021 6:56 AM] Armeanio#0321
No ETA for Kucoin yet. If you can set up a group chat on telegram or any other medium let me know.


[07/21/2021 6:58 AM] Armeanio#0321
Is there any eta on the legal entity for signing?


[07/21/2021 7:01 AM] Justin1000#9555
Will check. Dentons has been moving at a snails pace and I haven‚Äôt been pushing too hard since seems everything else is moving super slow too.


[07/21/2021 7:03 AM] Armeanio#0321
The latest with kucoin is Ilya and kushti have been managing integration, we are not yet to the marketing phase of integration, but appears to be coming relatively soon.  

Apparently they have 12+ projects onboarding and 4-5 wallet devs so it's been slow.


[07/21/2021 3:20 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 can we move forward with Redline with no legal entity ?


[07/21/2021 3:52 PM] Justin1000#9555
They don't care about legal entity i think. They said it is all "trust based" anyway. But I thunk they will want someone to sign the contract. Just says will give them 15k for the quarter. The 15pct royalty amount is gone already.


[07/21/2021 4:07 PM] Armeanio#0321
Redline is based in China? If so I don't mind signing, it's a non extradition country.


[07/21/2021 4:11 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah its totally a Chinese group although they may use an offshore entity for this agreement. 

Yeah I think risk should be really minimal. Probably don't need to sign right this minute...let me start the telegram chat tomorrow and finalize the agreement and send it around soon.


[07/21/2021 4:15 PM] Armeanio#0321
Sounds good. It seems we need market making in kucoin and bitcoincom.

For gate and biki we can do grids and arbitrage bots will follow. 

That should put us in a good position for future negotiations.

Oh now I know the problem. Seemed add you but never did...guess cuz your privacy settings. Can't recall solution to that?


[07/23/2021 7:41 AM] Justin1000#9555
Redline said can do bitcoin.com too but not till Aug 2nd as got a backlog.

Wasn't confidence inspiring at all though as seemed trader hadn't heard of bitcoin.com so I doubt they have ever made markets there.

Not sure if head trader has telegram as still hasn't entered the chat. Its not too popular app in China and I have just been talking to them on wechat but let's see.


[07/23/2021 2:47 PM] Armeanio#0321
Well if they cant get things live I would suggest we start with coinls for a month.


[07/23/2021 2:48 PM] Armeanio#0321
Just on bitcoincom.


[07/23/2021 2:48 PM] Armeanio#0321
We can test redlines services on kucoin once they go live.


[07/23/2021 2:49 PM] Armeanio#0321
Which I have no ETA on yet but they should get enough notice go be live day 1.


[07/23/2021 3:56 PM] Justin1000#9555
I was thinking same thing. I just don't know enough about either of them to know how reliable they are so better to get both working even if costs a little extra. And Redline won't be ready in time for bitcoin.com anyway so better to try out coinls there.


[07/23/2021 4:37 PM] Armeanio#0321
I've got that lined up. So we are good.


[07/24/2021 7:58 AM] Justin1000#9555
Ran into Becky at conference. She said they can do bitcoin.com and kucoin but can't start until Aug1 because got too many other projects.  She suggested we do bitcoin.com by ourselves for first couple days. Would be no extra cost for bitcoin.com. 

But still seems to me we should use coinls for bitcoin.com to build relationship with 2 MMs in case one is not so good.


[07/24/2021 2:37 PM] Armeanio#0321
I agree, Coinls has bitcoincom covered.  We are good there, set it up yesterday for one month.

Kushti is setting up the backend accounts needed this weekend.


[07/26/2021 5:22 AM] Armeanio#0321

Yes I studied traditional chinese medicine, but it was not so useful for the business development or blockchain so I did not add that as it is kind of irrelevant. I guess bedside manner counts. 

These days most of my time is spent in the community oriented nonprofit. We are in the process of moving at the moment to a new location in downtown Colorado Springs.

Perhaps the event space could see some Ergo related event at some point in the future.


[07/27/2021 8:09 AM] Armeanio#0321
Do we still need to sign the MM contract with Redline?


[07/27/2021 8:18 AM] Justin1000#9555
They would like us to sign it as a formality. I think you can just put the start date as the listing date for Kucoin and sign. Doubt anyone will ever look at it again... 

I suppose no listing date yet for Kucoin. Redline needs a little heads up. They originally said 1 week. If that isn't practical maybe we can just tell them to get ready now because we might not have that much notice


[07/27/2021 8:29 AM] Armeanio#0321
There should be joint marketing work that is needed between finalizing the wallet integration and the listing going live, so we should have time to set up the accounts. 

I can sign and send tomorrow, if needed. I think we can just tell them when the list date is given if the document isnt too important 

It seems they are waiting for that.


[07/27/2021 8:44 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah. You could consider just changing contract to say 3 months from kucoin listing date whenever that is confirmed. But doubt matters much


[07/27/2021 3:40 PM] Armeanio#0321
The Redline contract has been signed and returned.


[07/27/2021 3:42 PM] Armeanio#0321
Waiting for payment invoice and details


[07/28/2021 12:14 PM] Armeanio#0321
@kushti_ru @Armeanio Hi guys, hope you all have a good day so far. As the technical integration is almost done, please check the timeline below: 

The planned timeline for listing:

Listing announcement & Deposit opens - 10:00 UTC Friday
Trading opens - 10:00 UTC NEXT Monday


[07/28/2021 12:14 PM] Armeanio#0321
Kucoin wants to go live next monday need to see if this timeline is doable for Redline.


[07/28/2021 12:54 PM] Justin1000#9555
Finally!! Let's see but probably Redline will end up being good. If so we can expand our cooperation with them gradually.


[07/28/2021 1:04 PM] Armeanio#0321
So the update here is we pushed the kucoin list date back to august 5th. 

This is better for our marketing team and market maker.


[07/28/2021 1:04 PM] Armeanio#0321
We have signed with redline need to pay them asap to get things set up.

[07/29/2021 5:52 PM] Armeanio#0321
So the Latest is bitcoincom had an internal issue that delayed the listing. The plan is to go live Tuesday 10 am UTC. Coinls has been brought up to speed. Hopefully launch v2 goes smoothly. 

They will be pushing an announcement on their side.


[07/31/2021 2:45 AM] Armeanio#0321
What's the latest on this? We are getting a bit short on time.


[07/31/2021 4:26 AM] Justin1000#9555
Becky was just asking about it again.  seems redline needs payment before ethan will start the preparations and make detailed proposal etc. Technical team there seems won't prepare until get payment


[07/31/2021 4:34 AM] Justin1000#9555
She says tell her as soon as payment made so she can then immediately tell technical team to prepare to hopefully avoid a delay...


[07/31/2021 6:16 AM] Armeanio#0321
I don't have any access to that transfer or information. Not sure how to proceed.


[07/31/2021 6:18 AM] Armeanio#0321
I guess the exchange it was sent from flagged the transfer?


[07/31/2021 6:22 AM] Armeanio#0321
If we operate with the assumption that transfer doesnt clear soon, what is plan b?


[07/31/2021 11:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
It would be nice if @kushti could give redline a pic of the withdrawal confirmation or better yet get the withdrawal cleared by gate.io. not sure what the issue is. Quite odd.


[07/31/2021 11:32 AM] Justin1000#9555
My impression talking with Becky is that Redline has policy not to start work until paid. Maybe they are somewhat big group so have such policies because payment issues in the past. It's annoying though for sure.


[07/31/2021 11:35 AM] Justin1000#9555
I guess "back up plans" are 1) push back date again...which sucks or 2) get coinls to start for kucoin or 3) can @kushti make withdrawal of 5k and then separately send the 5k to redline ?  Should confirm first but I guess if they get 5k they can at least get ready then refund us 5k when payment finally goes through.


[07/31/2021 11:37 AM] glasgowm#9381
Sounds like a KYC issue? Users often report that their tx's get stuck on that


[07/31/2021 11:38 AM] Justin1000#9555
Well need to hear from @kushti any response to his ticket. Any clarity there?


[07/31/2021 11:39 AM] Justin1000#9555
We are in wechat with senior partner of Gate.io . They could probably help clear up issue


[07/31/2021 11:39 AM] Justin1000#9555
But no idea what the issue so not sure what to ask them. And need ticket number I guess


[07/31/2021 11:44 AM] Justin1000#9555
Payment is supposed to be quarterly so guess (3) isn't that great of an idea. Better to just sort the 15k payment out...


[07/31/2021 4:13 PM] Justin1000#9555
Fyi that Becky at redline says nothing she can do. Company policy is technical team does nothing until recieve payment...


[07/31/2021 4:17 PM] Armeanio#0321
I sold some btc so worste case can cover the initial 5k payment.


[07/31/2021 4:18 PM] Armeanio#0321
Will want a refund but it's a short term option, let me know busy day on my end.


[07/31/2021 4:21 PM] Armeanio#0321
Ok let's see if the 15k can get handled.


[07/31/2021 4:36 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah I had same thought but I don't have the 5k USDT on hand. Anyway I just asked Becky and they said they have company policy and won't do a thing without the 15k. Its really stupid if you ask me...maybe they don't trust us yet because haven't worked with us.  Not sure.


[07/31/2021 4:37 PM] Justin1000#9555
Maybe should get coinls warmed up.  If redline doesn't want the business that bad then forget about them.  @kushti can cancel the withdrawal


[07/31/2021 4:47 PM] Justin1000#9555
Okay so becky just called me. You can send the 5k to that address and they will start work and no delay. And then the 5k will be refunded when they get the 15k


[07/31/2021 4:47 PM] Justin1000#9555
In any case u will definitely get back the 5k from Foundation so go ahead and send them the 5k to the same address in telegram. Thanks @Armeanio ...good to avoid any further delays...


[07/31/2021 4:55 PM] Justin1000#9555
@Armeanio Just called me again. Said 1) make payment and 2) give access to account tomorrow with like 100 dollars in it so they can start testing


[07/31/2021 5:38 PM] Armeanio#0321
Ok sent waiting for a tx id


[07/31/2021 5:43 PM] Armeanio#0321
They have recieved a 5k usdt deposit lets test them for 3 months then decide who to proceed with.

[08/13/2021 4:55 AM] Justin1000#9555
Well Kucoin seems to have helped significantly although there is also other favorable things happening right now helping as well. I still feel as though exchanges are #1 priority problem for Foundation to solve. 

With current market cap and user base, I would think it feasible to list on the biggest exchanges although may take a little work and a lot of money to convince them. Huobi and Kraken are my preferences for next exchanges. Huobi for international/China, Kraken for US. Both top exchanges with huge ADA trading volume.

After that I suppose we could do Binance if people think the Ergo ecosystem is mature enough (although Binance looks like will be under attack by regulators). Bitfinex, Upbit, Bithumb, OKEX would be nice too. 

Actually I think it is worth considering moving earlier on Binance given how long Kucoin took. I understand and am sympathetic to the views about giving them too much control but its taking a long time to get listed on these exchanges and I would not want to miss the bull market window on Binance.


[08/13/2021 4:56 AM] Justin1000#9555
Last night I had a call with the CEO, the #1 guy at Redline about how to get us on Huobi. **CONFIDENTIALLY** (please don‚Äôt share outside this group) he said following:
-Huobi hard to list on right now. Very demanding on projects and cautious. Hundreds of projects waiting to list there. Need to work like 6 different people to get past gatekeepers.
-3 Conditions to get on:
1) Get past committee which has hundreds of projects trying to get listed

2) Deposit of about US$3mm worth of crypto and USDT as market-making and other deposit (probably similar to what we had for Kucoin but more) ‚Äì can be withdrawn later after conditions met

3) US$500-600k listing fee. Maybe higher if include other expenses.


[08/13/2021 4:56 AM] Justin1000#9555
So sounds like Huobi very expensive. I told him the listing fee was probably okay if we could pay in Ergs and that makes sense for them too because price basically sure to ramp if achieve but he said would be hard to pay all Ergs. The $3mm will be hard for us to meet because presumably large portion is non-ERG but we can try to negotiate details and stuff if we get a dialogue started.

He requested more info and then he would speak to them for us as he is very close to them. So we will send him some articles and update the Huobi info sheet. I also told him about our good relationship with Jinse who he also knows.


[08/13/2021 4:56 AM] Justin1000#9555
**Binance**: He said Binance would be easier than Huobi and less expensive. Total cost of roughly US$1mm including market-making requirements. He sounded confident could get it done for us and we just need to give him a $50k deposit and is refunded if not listed there in 6 months. The MM requirements at Binance apparently a lot less than Huobi.


[08/13/2021 4:58 AM] Justin1000#9555
Redline seems good so far to me. Can consider letting them make markets at other exchanges like gate, coinex etc if you think makes sense -  suppose could give it some more time and see. I told him so far cooperation had went smoothly and we should look to deepen and broaden it over time.


[08/13/2021 6:00 AM] Justin1000#9555
**Bitfinex: **Just sent chaser/update email to them.

I had a call with him this week he proposed getting me in contact with the leaders of sparkpool and bitfly/ethermine if we proceed.


[08/13/2021 7:33 AM] Armeanio#0321
I applied to binance as well no word yet on the review process. 

Kraken application is in motion, we are waiting for kushti to finish the technical part or the application.


[08/13/2021 7:35 AM] Armeanio#0321
I dont like paying mining pools since they take a cut from miners anyway. 

On the pro side it is a way to flip nano from pool dominance quickly and with additional contacts potentially positions erg to be a suitable replacement once eth leaves the pow space.


[08/13/2021 7:36 AM] Armeanio#0321
It would be good to get some feedback from everyone here about their thoughts with f2.


[08/13/2021 7:52 AM] glasgowm#9381
Awesome. Was going to suggest f2. They're huge


[08/13/2021 8:01 AM] Justin1000#9555
I don't like paying but is only around 5k ERGs and this seems extremely important and also great marketing opportunity so I strongly support proceeding with f2. So I think fine to pay to get this done asap. 

@deleted-role please let us know if you disagree or not so Armeanio can revert to f2 pool and get things started. Separately we can do a more formal vote in next day or two.

Alright I'm done for the the night. Off to bed.


[08/13/2021 10:24 AM] morphic#4133
Don't like paying to miners either, but if they can take nano down (to 40% at least) I fully support this.


[08/13/2021 3:19 PM] Armeanio#0321
With bittrex, they are at least interested, they currently have a 6 month backlog due to the recent market.

Most exchanges are much more excited about integrating ERC's and native token projects vs mainnets just due to the technical work involved. It seems most places have a shortage of devs (kucoin was 4 projects to 1 dev to onboard them when we applied) 

They will be watching over the next period and will get back to us about the integration.


[08/13/2021 4:54 PM] Armeanio#0321
@everyone please post your feedback regarding f2 today.


[08/13/2021 5:04 PM] kushti#0978
2miners is also big, and charging small coins with 2 BTC usually, listed ERG for free


[08/13/2021 5:05 PM] kushti#0978
I guess F2P will list ERG for free after some time


[08/13/2021 5:05 PM] kushti#0978
So I am against paying them


[08/13/2021 5:18 PM] Robert K#0722
I'll vote for paying them, as right now there is some good momentum from Kucoin and would be good to keep pushing good news


[08/13/2021 5:19 PM] Robert K#0722
Marketing/adoption tends to work in multipliers and so if we can do a lot in the same period of time it should result in more interest over the longer term


[08/13/2021 5:59 PM] Armeanio#0321
I'm mixed. On one hand it buys good marketing, market positioning, future business access and should address the hashrate problems short term. 

Long term I think it's not the best precedent to set and people do talk. So it could become a negative expectation.

I've been talking to Liang for a few months, my expectation is he would take a refusal as a slight. It could shut us out for a while. 

I support it just with the thinking if we can snag a few of the larger ETH pools others will follow suit as perception tips in our favor.

I am willing to try to counter just to see what happens, but approval to fallback to the original amount would be good to be clear on first.


[08/14/2021 6:17 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I think we should proceed with f2 and so just go ahead and pay them. Important to have more miner diversification.


[08/14/2021 8:19 AM] Justin1000#9555
I just had like a another 2 hour call with Redline CEO. 
-Huobi (**CONFIDENTIALLY**): Really hard and expensive. He said he has looked into it more and the likely cost would be 
* **Listing + Marketing Fee:** US$500-600k 
* **Deposit: **On top of that we would need to give Redline 80k ERGs as a deposit. He would return these if the listing was not successful, else it would be an additional cost
* **Airdrop/Mining:** I haven‚Äôt looked into details but he said Huobi has a ‚Äúmining‚Äù program where we would need to provide additional ~US$500k worth of ERGs. This sounded to me like an airdop.
* **Deposit:** Strangely this time he seemed to think this wouldn‚Äôt be needed. Maybe he was wrong about that during our first conversation. Not sure‚Ä¶


[08/14/2021 8:19 AM] Justin1000#9555
In my opinion, it would be worth it to pay the $500-600k + $500k Airdrop to get on Huobi if that was the formal proposal from them. (remember there are only 3-5 exchanges Huobi size so this is not a cost we are going to be paying many times). HOWEVER, I told him that it was very unlikely we would agree to the 80k ERGs additional deposit and payment upon listing. 

So I left it at that. I can‚Äôt say for certain all his info is correct but these guys really are very well connected so in absence of some other reliable source of info, I would be inclined to believe it. So I think we keep thinking about it and just hope Huobi comes around and decides Ergo is so good, they should list it now without that 80k ERG additional cost. I told the Huobi guy to contact the Jinse CEO for reference. But anyway I cant be optimistic about Huobi.


[08/14/2021 8:20 AM] Justin1000#9555
**Cooperation with Redline**: I also discussed Ergo a lot in general with him and he is interested in considering more cooperation and possibly even partnership. They invested in FTX very early and lots of other exchanges and platforms (guess they have made a huge amount of money in crypto). Like other Chinese parties, they are really keen on learning about Ergo because quality international projects are in huge demand in China. They also got 10 big KOLs and a big social media presence in China.


[08/14/2021 8:22 AM] Justin1000#9555
Bittrex would be nice so that is good they are considering...


[08/14/2021 8:23 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think we have huge evidence you are right about exchange situation and them not having capacity and devs to integrate chains like Ergo including: 
-Huobi having hundreds in line and I just heard again from Redline CEO that it is much harder because Ergo is its own chain and not ERC20
-Bitfinex friend said before they were crazy short handed and overbusy and I saw they were recently looking to hire more people for their listing team
-The slow Kucoin integration and difficulties we had there
-Bittrex feedback and various other indications


[08/14/2021 8:24 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think our original strategy and what I also preferred was for us to do Kucoin then 2 of [Huobi, Kraken, Okex, Bitfinex] and then go to Binance. But based on the above situation and how long it took just to get on Kucoin I think we need to change our strategy and immediately try our best to get on Binance. 

If we don‚Äôt, then we could be looking at 6 months or more to get on 2 of those other top exchanges. And while I am optimistic this time is different and this bull market won‚Äôt burn out in December and will instead go on much longer, I don‚Äôt think we should bet on that! 

I think we got some relationship with Binance. @kushti, can you please use whatever connections you have and push as hard as possible for us to get on Binance in the immediate future? Given their market share, getting on there will surely help the price a lot and with all the other momentum Ergo has, am optimistic then all the other exchanges will gradually add Ergo in coming 1-2 years.

All that being said, I will continue to push Huobi and it would also be great to get on these others like Kraken/Bitfinex/Okex etc.

[08/18/2021 5:27 AM] Justin1000#9555
I haven't heard of it. But Up says he has heard of it although hasn't used it. Does look big...130k twitter followers and support for 70 blockchains + some good partners and investors listed on website. Probably worth pursuing but I am doubtful want to support them too much with developer time etc. Not sure what the partnership would entail...would not want to devote too much time or resources to it probably although would be very good for them to add Ergo support.


[08/18/2021 5:33 AM] Justin1000#9555
Really hope we can get on some of the top exchanges...great video yesterday on the DEX but I feel benefit from those things is still limited by lack of top exchanges. My top 3 would be Binance, Huobi, Kraken. No word on Kraken right? Getting on there would be absolutely spectacular. Binance too of course‚Ä¶hope @kushti can do whatever he can on that front. 

I have had no progress with Huobi‚Ä¶will try chasing a few people right now.

Okex application in. I am not optimistic though as they have not been very responsive historically.

Bitfinex updated but no word back. Also have no reason to be optimistic there right now.


[08/18/2021 6:46 AM] Armeanio#0321
I'll see with mathwallet in the meantime ViaWallet is adding ERG support in their next version.


[08/18/2021 7:01 AM] Armeanio#0321
Exchanges and a lot of the infrastructure providers are bottlenecked. That just is what it is. I will keep in contact with larger exchanges and see if we have any opportunities. 

My thinking is the area where we have an advantage atm is adoption into mining pools.

My thinking is positioning ERG to pick up a decent share of GPU miners long term for if/when we see a migration with ETH 2, is probably the best short term strategy for long term growth.


[08/18/2021 7:34 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah the mining pool progress thanks to your efforts is great. Should have big pay off.

Yes, exchanges are bottlenecked and hard. That is why I think we need to chase them relentlessly and use whatever connections we have to push. Would hope with our collective connections and given the huge progress Ergo has made with community and other areas we can get one of these top exchanges to move us to the front of the line ASAP. Not on a single top 5 exchange yet‚Ä¶

Probably I have done all I can from my side at moment. We have been targeting Huobi hard for like 6 months but only had indirect connections (Jinse, Redline + some friends) until maybe now. The Huobi just asked for my telegram and said he would push the application to the listing guys. Maybe we can make some progress there. Will let you know.

@Armeanio Hey, just wanted to give you a heads up that a guy named Eyesteinh is interested in adding SigamUSD to a norwegian exchange (https://nbx.com/). He's a big Cardano guy that I knew a bit 4ish years ago and he knows the owner of nbx and wants to add the stablecoin there for some reason. I told him to message you to move forward on that (if that's fine).

Some things on exchanges:
**-Kucoin Leverage: **You guys can consider asking Kucoin to offer leveraged trading. Have seen this mentioned in the telegram groups with some people saying will boost volume. Gate.io now offers it as of yesterday: https://www.gate.io/en/article/22023

**-Hotbit withdrawal fee: **Think I saw in chats its still at 1 ERG. Please ask them to lower it in light of higher price and tell them it is hurting their own ERG volume to keep it high.

**-Gate.io deposit confirmations:** FYI once we add F2 Pool, I plan to tell them to lower this from 100 confirmations to 20-30 in light of higher hash rate, bigger pools, and no pool above 50% now

**-New exchanges: **Hope everyone is doing whatever they can here. I haven‚Äôt heard anything further from Huobi but will update the guy now‚Ä¶

@Armeanio I have a few questions, since we discussed more custom strategy to develop further your markets. 

Do you have some thoughts around resupply strategy we discussed one month ago?

Since market is generally retaining and if you have some tokens in the treasury - we can elaborate:
- cashout just for additional fundraising
- if funds are not vital for you, we can resupply them just to increase bid pressure in the mid term

Also, maybe you have some internal thoughts - we have pretty customizable abilities and would like to implement ideas if you have such.

On the mining front we still have multiple pools integrating. 

F2pools will start integration soon, I have had the marketing team put together some graphics for them to chose for our social announcement. Once I get their marketing info I will have a short article put together as well. 

I just got off a call with kucoin and have recieved a commitment to be added after to their mining pools after ETH, which should happen next month.

 Picked up some additional marketing contacts today I will pass them to Angie when she is back from vacation. 

I also will be having a call in the future with WMT and kushti to discuss partnership opportunities. 

Talked with murasaki at emurgo about the ergo dev proposal. We are clear to proceed on our side, it looks as though they want us to hire this developer. 

I also have been pushing for an emurgo x ergodex partnership we will see how that goes. 

@Robert K#0722  rumor has it dcSpark will be pushing out a wallet at some point, idk if there is any truth to the rumor or if it can be disclosed. 

If so this would be a good alternative as a potential partner for Ergodex as Emurgo certainly seems to be at a technical deficit without the dc crew.


[08/26/2021 7:57 AM] Armeanio#0321
Our month trial with coinls is coming to a close shortly. 

I would recommend an extension of the contract. So far they have been very easy to work with and have done a decent job at providing liquidity.

As an update from dcSpark's end (since you guys asked previously), here is our latest project we are working on: https://twitter.com/dcspark_io/status/1430457657006051340

This is private info, but I trust you guys, more info related to that will be disclosed in the very near future as well.


[08/26/2021 2:10 PM] Robert K#0722
Though as I said previously, we are really maxed out on our existing projects and so while I think it'd be awesome to do work in the Ergo ecosystem, we unfortunately can't manage it.


[08/26/2021 2:11 PM] Robert K#0722
We're already approaching 20 people in dcSpark and even so we're pushing it as it is working on a few major internal projects and multiple with 3rd parties.

@kushti I saw the discussion with Redline about access to MM account. FYI that I discussed account access with the head trader like a month ago when I met him face to face. He said it was typical to have account access but not access to withdrawal nor 2FA. Maybe there is settings can use to restrict what people can do with account or maybe just don't give 2FA access so can't withdraw or maybe both.


[08/28/2021 3:37 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti OKEX responded to our app (you can see the email). What time can you do the call on Monday? I think good to propose sometime between 2-5 pm HKT. It would be great to have @Armeanio on as well but I don't see how the time zones work unless you stay up really late so don't want to trouble you as not absolutely necessary. If you do want to be on Armeanio, maybe could propose 2 PM HKT Monday so 12 AM your time and 9 AM Russia. @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ pls also join if you can.

Beepool, the 5th largest ETH pool, added ERG today.

F2 #3 is on the way. 

I think if I can get the top 2, Spark/Ethermine, others will just follow. 

Nanopool appears to be going sub 40% of the hashrate most likely tomorrow. 

We have a call lined up with Okex and Bitfinex next week. I will circle back to Bittrex as well.

That is cool on Bitfinex. I know them well. I think they were one of the last exchanges to list Cardano  and probably not many Cardano users there. I believe they had a strong connection to EOS via Brock Pierce as opposed to Cardano. I think with them important to emphasize:
-Ergo is Independent from Cardano: Ergo is totally separate blockchain from Cardano although there is significant community overlap. 

-Target new User Base: Want to target the Bitfinex user base that may not be involved or interested in Cardano for marketing and awareness raising on Ergo. I think they have a big institutional investor client base. 

-Building on Ergo: Bitfinex trys to innovate wherever possible and besides tether and taking the lead on some Bitcoin stuff they have also tried to build dexes like Ethfinex and Eosfinex etc. So it should be emphasized that Ergo is open and permissionless and they can consider building on Ergo. Of course they may want to put Tether on Ergo. 

Probably best thing about listing on Bitfinex would be to help diversify Ergo user base a bit from Cardano and also geographically from the predominantly Chinese exchanges Ergo is on now. Also they may build on Ergo in the longer term. Not sure about their miner user base but presumably they got a lot of miners given how big they are. Not sure latest but historically they never required KYC.

Hi, We're a mid-level pool that would like to look into adding Ergo. We do everything in go though so I was wondering if you know of any clvm libraries in go or other development work that has been done in go? I sent an email to the ergo general email and haven't seen a reply yet.
Sorry for the PM but if our miners see me messaging in the lobby they will start asking us constantly when Ergo lol

Hey just following up on this. You did post in announcements you want more miners which is why I asked you hahaha. We're not huge compared to the Asian giants (we're like medium overall) but we are probably #1 or #2 in North America so we're decently famous?
Ethermine is going RVN/ETC so it makes sense for us to go the other way to CFX

I assume you'd like a top 5 pool thats legally in a Western nation and will attend conferences lol

just it needs to be in golang so if its not currently then we need to do a ton of work

unomie ‚Äî Today at 06:30
Don't think there's anything in golang on ergo. There's a scala API connector for gravity which uses golang if it's any use. But MHS_SAM would know best

[09/01/2021 1:58 PM] morphic#4133
Our main reference implementation is in Scala. It cannot be easily used from Go, that is true. But at the same time we also have already spent a lot for sigma-rust which is in Rust and can be used from any language, including Go. I believe using Rust libraries from Go should be even easier than using it from JS. (I will talk with greenhat about it). 
Keeping this in mind, technically there are two ways to go: 
1) we can fund additional work into extending sigma-rust to support mining and Chris2 et al. will do the development. Then they will be able to use Rust code from their Go miner.
2) we decide about spending much more funds to develop Go based miner toolkit and Chris2 & Co. will develop what is necessary.

There is not clear winner here, each variant has pros and cons. We can propose the first variant to them as long as greenhat confirms it is feasible and make sense.

@glasgowm just confirmed with greenhat. It is technically ok to use sigma-rust from Go as a library. So we can propose Chris2 to use sigma-rust as a library from their Go code. Technically it is far from ideal so they may have some objections about it. But if they agree with such design choice, and will be able to develop missing parts in sigma-rust, then EF should definitely fund this work.

That's not what I took from it. He's going to speak to his partners and get back to us with a proposal. I guess he means if they get the price they propose they'll make it open source but if they don't agree it's enough it'll be closed source.

Bitfinex maybe picking up some Chinese users.


[09/28/2021 7:47 PM] Armeanio#0321
Short term the best mid tier exchange we could add would probably be ascendex for 40k. Singapore based. 

Bitthumb global asked for 300k. 

Indodax needs incorporation documents, as do USA based exchanges. 

Still pursuing bitfinex/huobi/okex/binance.


[09/29/2021 5:41 AM] Justin1000#9555
Bitfinex just said no as you probably saw.

**Binance, Huobi and Okex**: I think despite the China ban, are still very attractive exchanges to list on. I would doubt the China crackdown would impact their listing policies as they moved offshore a long time ago and the China policies are aimed at restricting mainland user activity. 

**Ascendax**: I am indifferent. Probably same user base as Kucoin/Coinex so no new incremental users but would add redundancy. The $40k is affordable. Maybe if Kushti think it is worth his time...

**Bithumb**: Can‚Äôt tell how good they are. But would probably be some new users and understand they allow various fiat options. They are #16 on coingecko now.  Might be worth $300k if they are willing to take ~50% in Ergs.

**Indodax**: Once we do the video call and sign the docs, maybe Indodax would let us start the integration process. We could sign on a pre-incorporation basis. I think would be worth checking with them.


[09/29/2021 5:56 AM] Justin1000#9555
Bithumb Global could be worth it in absence of better options...I tried checking that similarweb site for info on website popularity for bitglobal.com but it doesn't have anything.

[09/29/2021 4:19 PM] Armeanio#0321
Generally larger exchanges are saying "Your volumes are not that big, we will consider listing ERG once that increases‚Äù. We like your product but we don‚Äôt like your market volume. ‚Ä®‚Ä®

I will see what Okex has to say, but this has been the general consensus so far. 

Depending on that we have 2 options. 

‚Ä®‚Ä®We can grow organically by adding some tier 2 exchanges and trying to slowly build/grow our market access/liquidity. 

Exchange agents have proposed we contact our market makers to do cosmetic trading on our core exchanges just to increase overall numbers to 20-30 mln per day. See if that opens doors for us. 

The second is a shady practice imo, but unfortunately it is common and has become a market expectation.


[09/29/2021 5:34 PM] Armeanio#0321
I will see if Bitthumb will take 50/50

Right now the larger exchange showing the most interest is Okex. I will let you know when I hear if they are willing to propose a listing.

I talked with Carlos a little more about a potential Oracle partnership with Waves Enterprise, nothing new to report though.

Gravity gives us an opportunity to break away from being seen only associated with Cardano so I will do my best to build other partnerships.


[10/07/2021 7:59 AM] Justin1000#9555
Sounds great! Very important initiative i think. I was imploring to Arthur Hayes for help with our exchange problem. But his suggestion so far was just get it on uniswap and sushiswap ASAP.

Should we try asking the F2pool guys to help us with a top 5 exchange? Wang Chun joined our f2pool chat in telegram. They should be keen to help a promising PoW coin gain traction.


[10/12/2021 10:07 AM] glasgowm#9381
Just a note that the proposal I posted here spoke about approaching exchanges in their most recent email (although I'm not entirely sure what they mean)

https://discordapp.com/channels/859017542043303937/881202756776493126/896151988457316372

This was in response to me saying I liked the idea but wouldn't the EF backing it taint the idea?

```
We also considered the optics of an EF contribution and do not disagree with you. It was, in part, this consideration that led to the inclusion of the charitable component, to soften the edge a little.

The original concept was actually to raise funds among the community directly via the typical social channels. The obvious hurdles there are overcoming the understandable barriers to trust in a timely manner, and being able to communicate to donors why the distributions are being divided into smaller transactions to accomplish any given deposit amount without directing potentially negative attention to mining efficiency volatility. After all, if I gave someone money to give to someone else, I might wonder why it had been divided into five transactions; but, if I were given money, I would care much less about how many times deposits were made when the sum I would ultimately receive was unknown in advance. In fact, I‚Äôd likely be pleased by each new deposit!  

In any event, I appreciate you voicing your concern. It will certainly direct our near-term course of action. If we considered it and you considered it, I‚Äôd put a wager on others among the board having similar hesitations. I will go ahead and start putting feelers out this weekend to see what we might be able to drum up from exchange partnerships and the like. I‚Äôll also talk to the group about reevaluating the ‚Äúby the community, for the community‚Äù approach. 

When we began moving forward with this project in earnest, we were operating with the knowledge that funding wouldn‚Äôt be an issue. As tends to be the nature of things like this, the benefactor that we have the majority of future commitments from is already getting a little iffy. They are an investor first and are just looking to back the surest thing in the new mining era, so I don‚Äôt fault them. However, the others in our little group really are die-hard miners and like the platform, so we‚Äôre in. If we manage to put a bead on funds that don‚Äôt require an over-reliance on the whims of this one person, we‚Äôll proceed as planned in the coming weeks.

That being said, our activity on the network will be obvious enough once we kick off. If you notice or hear about something that we‚Äôre missing and/or feel that the activity is creating any adverse effects whatsoever, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out. When Ergo wins, we all win!```

After Binance issued the notice, OKEx gave a statement, without mentioning the withdrawal of Chinese users, indicating that there is no change as before. OKEx wants to take over users from Huobi 
 and binance. OKB's price explained everything.

Okex will be picking up more users if this is accurate


[10/13/2021 1:26 PM] Justin1000#9555
Its not clear but its possible Okex is actually closer to government than the other exhanges. At least some very unconfirmed speculation on that. Star Xu was dissapeared for like 40 days last year. And they seem relaxed about the new policies.

@Armeanio Brian (the weather derivative entrepreneur and former head of Swiss Re weather derivative unit) has been on the look out for us and is doing a call next Tuesday morning with StoneX group‚Äôs crypto expert. He has worked with them for years. Looks like is a $1.5bn Nasdaq listed company providing financial services and trading in all sorts of commodities, currencies and more. Also claims to be a Fortune 100 Company. I took a quick look and don‚Äôt see any specific crypto product offerings they have at moment. But there is a bunch of simple crypto blog posts on their website and it would be logical for them to be expanding into crypto now so sure they are very much looking into it. 

I am not sure anything will come of this but might make sense to help Brian out on it. He is asking for materials. Would it be practical to provide him with a cut down, non-confidential, possibly reformatted version of the Kraken document?

Also if there is follow-up calls to this first one, you might consider joining him on the call if you think it is of interest.

[10/24/2021 5:07 PM] Armeanio#0321
Can you forward me his contact information?


[10/25/2021 3:45 AM] Justin1000#9555
I just sent an email introducing you guys. I don‚Äôt want to create a hassle or unnecessary work for you. BUT in my opinion, it really is worth spending a little time to help Brian out and see what comes of it. The guy is like 65 with a huge network, long successful history in business and while not a crypto guy, he is highly intelligent. And he is very keen to help on Ergo as retired so looking for something to do. Possibly something good could come of it as he must have great connections into traditional finance and they are moving into crypto especially in US. He is a possible candidate for some future role at the Ergo Foundation. But its not clear at this point anything will come of it.

This is his linked-in: https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-o-hearne-97a79726/

[10/26/2021 10:01 AM] Justin1000#9555
Seems to me we should do some PR campaign for ~$50k to raise Ergo's profile.  I met these guys yesterday. Angie thinks their proposal looks attractive but she would want to modify it. She said also done work previously on other agencies and could put together a proposal if the foundation was open to considering the idea.

I know a guy here who says he is friends with the Chief Risk Officer of Huobi. Chief Risk Officer didn‚Äôt want to help though. But he was also able to make contact with Li Lin, the founder of Huobi apparently. So had Eva make a 2 page summary of Ergo in Chinese and have sent it to the guy I know to send to Li Lin. Will see if anything comes of it. Will probably have to pay a lot of ERGs and USDT to get listed if its possible at all.

Need to get Ergo on top exchanges soon. Suspect its not going to be possible for Ergo to gain mindshare effectively versus the likes of Solana, Avalanche etc if not on top exchanges. @kushti, hope you are reaching out to IOG and whoever else you know again on Binance.

Have put Angie in touch with the PR firm I met and am also getting a referral to another one. Think she will put together a proposal for USDT ~50k or so.

[10/28/2021 11:26 AM] kushti#0978
let's see how it goes


[11/01/2021 10:29 AM] glasgowm#9381
I think pushing Kucoin on adding the futures grid bots for erg would help with our volume. Might add a fair bit as their regular grid bot is pretty terrible for IL and mostly unused.


[11/04/2021 11:12 PM] kushti#0978
yeah, also I think we can ask gate.io about ERG/BTC pair


[11/05/2021 7:02 AM] Justin1000#9555
The Redline 3 months is over. They are asking if we are satisfied and if want to continue?


[11/05/2021 1:51 PM] morphic#4133
Hm, what they did? I didn't noticed anything. I saw one volume spike some time ago, is it their activity?


[11/05/2021 7:53 PM] Armeanio#0321
I am talking to Dan to get a recommendation. 

Overall they fufilled the book requirements but traded at a loss. I think overall Coinls did better. 

Kucoin is somewhat unique as user bots are popular and actively trading against MM's


[11/05/2021 8:00 PM] Armeanio#0321
I think it's a good time to adjust our strategy.


[11/05/2021 8:19 PM] Armeanio#0321
It looks like there will be a call on Monday. CoinLS is also in the process of providing an update for their MM plan.


[11/08/2021 8:58 AM] Justin1000#9555
So far nothing has came of the Huobi connection. Li Lin, the Founder of Huobi said wouldn't do anything to influence his team. My contact was going to go back to the Chief Risk Officer and try again but I haven't heard anything so am not optimistic.


[11/08/2021 9:08 AM] Justin1000#9555
All we asked them to do was to fulfil the requirements Kucoin set for maintaining order books. As far as I can tell, they did that job fine. 

I am doubtful can do anything else on Kucoin really. They charge 0.07% for trading there. So just to even boost volume by US$2mm a day would cost US$1400 a day which is prohibitively expensive. I think the downsides to Redline are:
1)    Chinese team so maybe communication a bit of an issue
2)    Their fees for additional services maybe high. They were going to charge a lot just for cash out and never came down to the 0.5% that Coinls offered

I leave it you guys to keep em or not. The expense is minimal for Redline but if think better to just give everything to coinls defer to you. One reason to work with Redline in past was to potentially work with them on other things. Nothing has came of that yet but they are a serious group and early investor in a lot of things including FTX. Also, I see Angie is talking to them right now in Telegram about potential PR.

So maybe @Armeanio and @kushti and @glasgowm  can have a think about it. They said would do the market making for a few more days while we decide. To be honest, it might actually be better to keep them for another 3 months given the relationship.


[11/08/2021 9:18 AM] glasgowm#9381
I have no strong opinion - hard to tell what's grid bots, 3rd party bots, and what's the MM on KuCoin. No complaints re: liquidity but the order book is weird and jumps about a lot. 

Communication is great from CoinLS, team seems genuine. 

KuCoin has said that they'll announce future grid bots for erg if they decide to support it. :/


[11/08/2021 3:58 PM] Armeanio#0321
I told Becky to give us a week to explore our options.


[11/08/2021 4:00 PM] Armeanio#0321
CoinLS is preparing a liquidity strategy for us aside from Kucoin. 

 There is another potential MM I want to speak with, when I have a few options to put in front of everyone lets vote. 

With the ergodex, AH, and Dan F announcements I think we may have an active week.


[11/10/2021 8:34 AM] glasgowm#9381
What is going on with Coinsbit? ERG still listed there to buy but people can't withdraw. Message from DeadIT a while ago saying it was a scam.


[11/10/2021 11:20 PM] Armeanio#0321
I have no contact there. I had a call with bibox, I need to review a few things.


[12/08/2021 1:40 PM] glasgowm#9381
can we get an ERG/fiat pair on changelly? so we can get the buy erg button?

can/should we ask Kucoin to fix their KYC / ask them to look into the wash trading happening? Seems like the same 150k ERG being dumped on USDT pair and bought on BTC pair

I think the $30k for ADAERG pair add on kucoin mentioned by @Armeanio  is good idea and should do asap. 

Not really sure the others are worth the time. Really need top 5. But it has been too long without any listings so maybe MEXc and/or ascendex and/or indodax could make sense. Could ask Kairon their views.

I definitely think ergo should list on indodax but it might not do much in short term so we could leave it aside for now given lack of funds right now.

Due process is for plebs. Might makes right in Canada. If someone dissents, you just confiscate their wealth, revoke their licenses, exclude them from the financial system and kill their pets. No need to debate the law, policy or even rights when you have a monopoly on violence.

@Armeanio I recall you are working with Ergopad on potentially getting a deal with an exchange to list Ergo tokens. Eva reached out and asked me to relay to you that should consider carefully which exchange do this on. She suggests Gate.io is better option than Kucoin and Coinex. The whales are at Gate according to her. 

She spoke to Marty about it before and I guess he is turned off by the KYC. I actually briefly exchanged messages with Marty about this topic too and got similar feedback. But I don‚Äôt know what the obsession is with non-KYC. Should go wherever will get the most $ in-flow. If that is Gate, then probably better choice. I suppose can only reach a deal with one exchange because the expected low liquidity. Can‚Äôt people who want no KYC just get ERG at Kucoin/Coinex anyway and go via Dex to other tokens?

Up, one of the Ergo Chinese social media managers thought Gate would agree to very good pricing on listings. I am not so sure myself given how small the market cap of these are but he should know better and we could certainly try talking with Gate about it.

I haven‚Äôt researched this in-depth myself and so don‚Äôt have really firm view but I wanted to relay their feedback.


[06/15/2022 6:51 AM] Armeanio#0321

@Armeanio Was just badgering Arthur Hayes again on Telegram. He'll give us intro to the listing head of Bitmex spot. I think they are still pretty small volume but are a big name so probably would be good to list there as long as the charges are minimal.

I also keep wanting to make Arthur an Ergo supporter. So far, I don‚Äôt think he has taken a serious look despite me talking to him about it off and on. But getting on Bitmex might help.

Sent an email to him and cc‚Äôd you. He will intro us to the listing head.

Seems cz wants us to spam them with weekly progress updates


[07/05/2022 4:06 AM] Justin1000#9555
I don‚Äôt trust what he says here or anywhere. I listened to like an hour video of him 2 years ago saying it was all about community and then would list projects with strong community. Well Ergo CRUSHED THAT completely last year and continues to do so largely due to your efforts and its demonstratable on Reddit and other metrics. Yet heard nothing from them!!!

We‚Äôre supposed to waste our valuable time providing updates specifically to binance team every week but they don‚Äôt think we are worthy of having a contact person to make sure what we are writing is read??? And Ergo is already such mature project, should take 10 minutes for the listing team to evaluate it.


[07/05/2022 4:07 AM] Justin1000#9555
So only reasons why I can think they haven‚Äôt listed are:
-Volume of ERG relatively low ‚Äì but if this is so important, that means what CZ said about community is all bull shit. And ERG volume isn‚Äôt THAT low‚Ä¶it had plenty of times was >$10mm a day. So if this is a reason, its not a good one.
-Lack of contact ‚Äì We are falling below radar somehow. This means both us and Binance are not doing our job in that case. Maybe someone with high level contact can push it.
-Protecting their ecosystem of VCs/BNB etc ‚Äì Maybe in early days they cared about the principles of crypto, but now seems they are just like any other companies and focused purely on making money for shareholders. Ergo is an outsider because it doesn‚Äôt have their VCs backing it and isn‚Äôt integrated into their whole binance chain ecosystem.


[07/05/2022 4:07 AM] Justin1000#9555
I don‚Äôt buy this whole integration of layer 1 token being a reason! Hotbit and Probit didn‚Äôt have any issues listing Ergo back in 2019 right after mainnet launch!!! And they are like 1/50th to 1/1000th size of Binance. This excuse is just a fancy way of saying they don‚Äôt want to integrate layer 1s because it might disrupt.


[07/05/2022 4:08 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Armeanio  any progress at all on Binance? A Binance listing is the best single way to solve EF‚Äôs funding problems and also give some relief to those trying to build businesses on Ergo right now like Ergopad, all the projects launched on Ergopad and Getblok.io etc. I got one contact at Binance US who recently moved to Canada. But he is mid-level only.


[07/05/2022 4:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
Nothing wrong with providing weekly updates. I am just afraid it might not be even read if we don‚Äôt have a contact at Binance. This sounds more like something an early ERC-20 project should be doing to get on Binance, not Ergo. There is a huge amount of public content created every week in Ergo now.

[07/05/2022 4:58 AM] Justin1000#9555
Just did a quick check. For coins ranked 200-250, only 21/50 are on Binance, slightly lower than I would have thought. But some of these are small stable coins or exchange tokens so don't count. Also, if Ergo was on Binance, it would be top 200 easily so that skews it too. But anyway, plenty of tokens around Ergo market cap NOT on Binance.

I still think it‚Äôs odd didn‚Äôt list Ergo given emphasis CZ put on community in evaluating listings. 

The weekly updates could make sense. But hopefully its just copy and paste from community content because without a contact giving us assurance it matters, I am not even sure they will read it.

any chance we could increase the huobi promo offer? max 200 erg is not very enticing and allocation is mostly unused.

Suppose is fake but FYI


[09/26/2022 6:25 AM] Justin1000#9555
Gave him team@ergoplatform.org email and but didn't say anything else in case fake. While I agree with idea of building volume on secondary exchanges, do think we should list there ASAP if get chance and is not cost prohibitive. It‚Äôs just unfortunate fact of this industry that exchange trading concentrated in Binance to a big degree. And while Ergo volume is still low, it‚Äôs a far more mature platform and has much more to offer than the vast majority of coins currently on Binance so seems ready to me.

yeah, I received it too. Actually, receiving a few of such DMs every week.

This afternoon, FTX asked for our help. There is a significant liquidity crunch. To protect users, we signed a non-binding LOI, intending to fully acquire https://t.co/BGtFlCmLXB and help cover the liquidity crunch. We will be conducting a full DD in the coming days.
