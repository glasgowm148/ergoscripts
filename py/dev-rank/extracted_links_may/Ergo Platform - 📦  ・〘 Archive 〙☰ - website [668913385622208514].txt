We need to have a documentation portal which may look something like this https://developers.komodoplatform.com/
This one specifically uses https://vuepress.vuejs.org/, but our site is based on React. 
I wonder are there any examples of simiar frameworks in React?
I like this one in particular because it is markdown-centric, means any one practicing markdown can write and add new pages. 
It even have built-in "Suggest an improvement for this page" link which jumps directly to github page edit where you can fix the typos and submit a PR.


[01/22/2020 9:52 AM] morphic#4133
@Dmitry Usov what do you think?


[01/22/2020 9:53 AM] morphic#4133
I found https://www.gatsbyjs.org/ but it looks more complex

I would like to be able to edit md file, commit to master and let GitHub Pages automatically publish it. And I also like "Suggest an improvement for this page" feature


[01/22/2020 10:22 AM] Dmitry Usov#0134

I will give you my answer at the evening


[01/22/2020 2:18 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
Ye. I think gatsbyjs will be good for us. One of the reasons, we use react everywhere


[01/22/2020 2:20 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
And I also know that he‚Äôs really great


[01/22/2020 2:21 PM] morphic#4133

@Dmitry Usov Can we have "foldable" sections when we render HTML out of markdown for blog post? I mean for
```
...
really long code

```
can we render it into a foldable section? 

EDIT: so that it's folded by default and user can unfold it.

@Dmitry Usov I'm trying to create a simple design for the website so I can present the text within that. Are you able to add a slider to the site, or one or two other effects? (Sorry if I've asked this already, I can't remember)


[02/05/2020 11:04 AM] hir0#9158
I think a scrolling one-page site would be good


[02/05/2020 11:04 AM] hir0#9158
Clean, lots of white space, simple but elegant layout


[02/05/2020 1:01 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
Slider like at landing page ergoplatform.org 2019-2018 or what you mean?


[02/05/2020 1:01 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134

Ah, I can't find a good one. But something like this: https://www.talktalk.co.uk/


[02/05/2020 1:24 PM] hir0#9158
Basically we just need to be able to cycle through different features within the same area of the site

@Dmitry Usov how can we add working maillist on the website ?


[02/06/2020 3:11 PM] hir0#9158
That's cool. @Dmitry Usov I've got the text ready, but the other thing is it would be good to arrange it around the 8-sided logo, which is more of a graphical thing


[02/06/2020 3:12 PM] hir0#9158
Is that something you can do, or do we need a different approach for now?

[02/06/2020 9:09 PM] hir0#9158
Perhaps let's do one element at a time, see how it looks, make sure we're happy and go onto the next?


[02/06/2020 9:35 PM] kushti#0978
@hir0 agree,  let's iterate, and with no graphics as we do not have it now (but surely it is better to have it eventually!)

Cool. Let's start with the rotating text @Dmitry Usov ?


[02/07/2020 5:35 AM] Dmitry Usov#0134
Ok


[02/07/2020 5:40 AM] Dmitry Usov#0134
I will give you link to prototype at Saturday.

[02/08/2020 12:50 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
okay one minute


[02/08/2020 12:51 PM] hir0#9158
And then on the right, the carousel with 'Smart money is...'


[02/08/2020 12:51 PM] hir0#9158
That would be cool


[02/08/2020 12:51 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134

[02/08/2020 12:52 PM] hir0#9158
No, keep Ergo builds...


[02/08/2020 12:52 PM] hir0#9158
But on the right of the screen, maybe the slider/carousel with the Smart money is... rotating text


[02/08/2020 12:53 PM] hir0#9158
Your text animation with typing text was cool, maybe you could use that for the longer descriptions?


[02/08/2020 12:54 PM] hir0#9158
Like Smart money is: Conservative


[02/08/2020 12:54 PM] hir0#9158

Got to grab food with family - will take a proper look later and get feedback to you


[02/08/2020 1:03 PM] hir0#9158

Back in a bit - @kushti and anyone else, do you have feedback?


[02/08/2020 1:05 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
we have very strong text about us - "Ergo builds advanced cryptographic features and radically new DeFi functionality on the rock-solid foundations laid by a decade of blockchain theory and development. " need to add it


[02/08/2020 1:07 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
but I don‚Äôt know in which section


[02/08/2020 1:37 PM] hir0#9158
Yes, you're right... So can we:
Put that text under Welcome to Smart Money


[02/08/2020 1:38 PM] hir0#9158
Move the slider to the right side of the page?


[02/08/2020 1:38 PM] hir0#9158
Then the next section, I don't think we need the titles again since we have them in the menu on the left


[02/08/2020 1:39 PM] hir0#9158
And there are another couple of sections there, should be 8 in total


[02/08/2020 1:51 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
animation takes all views of yourself


[02/08/2020 1:52 PM] hir0#9158

[02/08/2020 1:52 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
i cant add slider + text


[02/08/2020 1:52 PM] hir0#9158
I mean there are 8 sections below, Research-led... etc


[02/08/2020 1:52 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
because slider gets all views

only slider or text


[02/08/2020 1:54 PM] hir0#9158
Well, there's a lot of unused space on that page. Maybe we can use it better


[02/08/2020 1:54 PM] hir0#9158
Like centre all text, put title at the top, then the description, then lower down where there's more space the slider


[02/08/2020 1:55 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
maybe in another section we can put the text

Cool, thanks for your work. Let's get some more feedback


[02/08/2020 4:06 PM] mx#5165
overall text is more accessible and better imo than previous version, slider is indeed a distraction, could there be maybe just one strong sentence?


[02/08/2020 4:08 PM] mx#5165
maybe - Smart money is: Ambitious. Because Smart isn‚Äôt afraid to try new ideas.


[02/08/2020 4:10 PM] mx#5165
without slider at all


[02/08/2020 8:16 PM] hir0#9158
Well, I'm keen we keep the slider in some form, with the different descriptions. I think it's important and is designed to draw the eye to give an overview!


[02/09/2020 8:19 AM] morphic#4133
I like the slider, but we need to increase the time interval twice.


[02/09/2020 12:51 PM] hir0#9158
Good call!


[02/09/2020 12:51 PM] hir0#9158

[02/09/2020 1:05 PM] kushti#0978
@hir0 texts are looking good. I can argue about some sentences, but after my corrections they'll be too technical probably ) so let's go ahead with the texts


[02/09/2020 1:05 PM] hir0#9158
Haha, ok. We can iterate of course


[02/09/2020 1:06 PM] hir0#9158

@Dmitry Usov when can we update the website?

[02/10/2020 7:07 PM] hir0#9158
Sorry, waiting for other people to provide feedback!


[02/10/2020 7:20 PM] hir0#9158
Ok, so I have another couple of minor pieces of feedback. Other people can suggest things, but if not soon then I think we should update the site


[02/10/2020 7:21 PM] hir0#9158
Can we move the title up a line or so? Then the 'Ergo builds...' summary as we have it now


[02/10/2020 7:21 PM] hir0#9158
Then can we have static text, 'Smart money is:'


[02/10/2020 7:22 PM] hir0#9158
And then the four slider texts below that, but a little slower, and continuing to rotate back to the first one again


[02/10/2020 7:22 PM] hir0#9158
Does that all make sense?


[02/10/2020 7:22 PM] hir0#9158
It just spaces everything out a little more and makes it more readable


[02/11/2020 4:09 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
Okay


[02/11/2020 4:09 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134

@Dmitry Usov Seems like something is wrong, at least with my version


[02/12/2020 4:49 PM] hir0#9158
Smart money is: moves left as the other text unrolls - and I can't actually see the other text


[02/12/2020 4:49 PM] hir0#9158
Does anyone else have this issue?


[02/12/2020 4:50 PM] hir0#9158
'Smart money is:' should not be part of the slider any more. It's just another line of text

i think we can keep it


[02/13/2020 5:45 PM] hir0#9158
I would say that if those links can easily be found elsewhere, delete that section on the homepage - though it's lower down so it doesn't detract really from the look

@hir0 @mx guys, hello, maybe you can help me. I've added tags mechanism, now me need to add tags to all blog posts and I don‚Äôt know what tags in which post should be. Can any of you be able to write them for me? 
https://github.com/ergoplatform/website/tree/master/content/en/blog all english blog posts.
As an example:
1. 2018_10_19-smart-contracts.md / tags - "ergo", "digest" ....

[02/16/2020 2:03 PM] hir0#9158
Hmm, not sure about seo so much. We need to figure out what tags we want


[02/16/2020 2:29 PM] NoneInParticular#6842
Hey guys


[02/16/2020 2:30 PM] NoneInParticular#6842
We gotta tag crypto, bitcoin, Ethereum, Blockchain, etc. words with high search stats, I can find out and provide a list


[02/16/2020 2:40 PM] NoneInParticular#6842
@Dmitry Usov  can you verify ownership of the website with Google Search Console?


[02/16/2020 2:41 PM] NoneInParticular#6842
Maybe we could use some of the tools they offer


[02/16/2020 4:00 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
It is not for seo


[02/16/2020 4:01 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
It‚Äôs just increase user experience with blog


[02/16/2020 4:25 PM] mx#5165
i use these ones on twitter but probably these should include something like sigma protocols, more some tags from developers i think

#Scorex #ZKProof #Cryptocurrency News #ErgoScript #Privacy #Blockchain #ProofOfWork $ERG


[02/16/2020 4:28 PM] mx#5165

@hir0 Hey Cass, yeah well i got entry! ) What did you guys have in mind that we could improve in the website via imagery? @Dmitry Usov @mx


[02/17/2020 8:48 AM] hir0#9158
Well, you're the designer @NoneInParticular üòõ What do you think?


[02/17/2020 8:59 AM] NoneInParticular#6842
The website looks a bit minimalist right now but I wouldn't say is bad or specifically ugly. Depending on what other things need to be done I would allocate time to this or whatever is higher in the importance heriarchy.


[02/17/2020 9:31 AM] hir0#9158
Yes, I was originally hoping it could be overhauled with new graphics, layout etc, but there was limited capacity


[02/17/2020 12:58 PM] NoneInParticular#6842

Hello guys! I have some good news from frontend.
First. I've worked here 1 year üôÇ For this year I made website, ergo-js, ergo-node-interface and improve ergo-explorer. It is great working with you, guys :)

Second. Recent months I've increasing my dev skills and now I want to share it with us. 

I finally improved the deployment to the site, I didn‚Äôt have enough skills before that to understand how to put together all the routine commands that I carry out, together. For business - it will increase my speed to deploy new blog posts or news.

Now I know how to improve my developer experience at node-interface. The problem is - CORS errors from backend, It is hurt develop and support node-interface with CORS. I will solve it open proxy at local machine. Next step is improve deploy:)) For business - more faster resolve issues for ergo-node-interface.

Now I working on explorer-frontend. I want to improve developer experience on it - I will update explorer dependencies, they has not been updated for several years. For business - more faster resolve issues for explorer-frontend.

I've also have experience with - https://svelte.dev/. What do you think if I create widget at main page on website with information about ergo-blockchain. How much blocks, how much hash rate, supply, transactions per day and the link to explorer? üôÇ

@Dmitry Usov I'm not sure I've understood what you propose to create, please clarify


[04/23/2020 3:00 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
I want make widget like https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/ header and integrate it at main page on website


[04/23/2020 3:02 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
This widget we could integrate at all our sites, our friends pages on the web / etc


[04/23/2020 3:05 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
I think it can improve our marketing?


[04/23/2020 3:06 PM] morphic#4133
Sounds good, but only widget is not enough. There should be some cache behind it to avoid overloading Explorer with this simple statictics requests.


[04/23/2020 3:07 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
maybe @Ilya | Spectrum could made some method and cache it in new backend explorer


[04/23/2020 3:09 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
it is not need now, maybe later


[04/23/2020 3:11 PM] morphic#4133
I think for this banner-like widget we can rely on CDN somehow.


[04/23/2020 3:12 PM] morphic#4133
Don't know how to use it, though.


[04/23/2020 3:12 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
delivery widget - yes


[04/23/2020 3:13 PM] morphic#4133
So basically we need to avoid having traffic on our servers


[04/23/2020 3:14 PM] morphic#4133
Unless we want to count views


[04/23/2020 3:14 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
We can count views add google analytic or etc


[04/23/2020 3:14 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
I think


[04/23/2020 3:19 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
I can do frontend but I have not backend experience. Think for data me need some server with demon which will be going to explorer and store info data one time per day and nginx which will deliver this data.


[04/23/2020 3:20 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
think it is all me need at backend

[04/28/2020 10:51 PM] Robert K#0722
Oh yeah and quick question @morphic, do FlowCards allow for data inputs? I'm not sure what would even be a clean way to graphically display data inputs in a diagram that differentiates them clearly from normal inputs and keeps the diagrams easily readable/followable.


[04/29/2020 8:57 AM] morphic#4133
@Robert K DataInputs are regular boxes, so they can be shown the same way as any other boxes. The difference is in their relation to transaction. So in the diagram the relation can be visually differentiated using dashed arrows of a different (say blue, magenta etc) color.

Sorry for butting in here, but maybe it could be a good idea to spread out the blog posts so you don't have 2 on the same day and so the content that comes out will feel like a constant flow which is easier for people to find time to read through & seems like more is going on.


[04/29/2020 6:45 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
@Robert K you mean me need to delete one post and add it later, maybe tommorrow? or just change dates?

[05/07/2020 7:47 PM] mx#5165
i would even use only photo with fog


[05/07/2020 7:47 PM] filippounits#3593
I have never been able to sync the full node (with the full UTXO set)


[05/07/2020 7:47 PM] mx#5165
ah ok


[05/07/2020 7:51 PM] mx#5165
@filippounits were you using command to limit ram at start to for example 512?


[05/07/2020 7:55 PM] mx#5165
like


[05/07/2020 7:55 PM] mx#5165
java -jar -Xmx512M -Dlogback.stdout.level=INFO ergo-xxx.jar --mainnet -c settings.conf


[05/07/2020 7:58 PM] filippounits#3593
I don't have any image that show that command that include the RAM limitation with -Xmx512M


[05/07/2020 7:59 PM] mx#5165
how do you launch node on Rpi?


[05/07/2020 8:01 PM] filippounits#3593
with this command: java -jar -Xmx512m ergo-x.x.x.jar ‚Äîmainnet -c ergo.conf 
but as said, I haven't any image to prove it


[05/07/2020 8:02 PM] mx#5165
ah ok so you are using limitation already, maybe try to reduce logs additionally as above and then see if you can sync full node


[05/07/2020 8:04 PM] mx#5165
eventually you can experiment with increasing amount of 512 to for example to 768


[05/07/2020 8:04 PM] filippounits#3593
I've tried several times, with -Xmx512m and -Xmx256m too but the raspy is going out of memory


[05/07/2020 8:05 PM] mx#5165
with limiting for sure, try to go up


[05/07/2020 8:05 PM] mx#5165
and with logs reduced to info


[05/07/2020 8:05 PM] filippounits#3593
also with -Xmx1G


[05/07/2020 8:05 PM] mx#5165
1G is too much if you have max 1G on device


[05/07/2020 8:06 PM] mx#5165
i would try


[05/07/2020 8:06 PM] filippounits#3593
tbh never tried with -Xmx768m


[05/07/2020 8:07 PM] mx#5165
java -jar -Xmx768m -Dlogback.stdout.level=INFO x.x.x.jar ‚Äîmainnet -c ergo.conf


[05/07/2020 8:08 PM] mx#5165
logs by default are in debug mode that consumes lots of memory


[05/07/2020 8:08 PM] mx#5165
you can also try later 512 with logs limited to info


[05/07/2020 8:09 PM] filippounits#3593
let me try. Only the headers need about 24h, then I estimate that it will take another 24h for the UTXO set

do you think is better the 3.2.2 or the alpha 3.3.0?


[05/07/2020 8:22 PM] mx#5165
maybe incoming 3.2.3


[05/07/2020 8:23 PM] mx#5165

@filippounits eventually you can create proposal for grant


[05/07/2020 11:43 PM] kushti#0978
@mx @filippounits 3.3.0 will have significant performance improvements in the wallet, for UTXO set, we're currently investigating where memory consumed.
So optimizations here will come after 3.3.0.  
However, in the long term holding UTXO set along with other datastructures in 512 mb will not be realistic anyway, or sloow. Light-fullnode is the solution. 
For headers, nipopow will be the answer once support for it  in the networking protocol will be done

Ergo mining pool
Lastly, we have Ergo‚Äôs first mining pool!

This is a really interesting development, since Ergo includes protection against ordinary pools by design. This is a feature implemented to improve decentralisation and accessibility for smaller, regular miners.

Jason, the pool owner, has created a decentralised pool using a smart contract that ensures miners who connect to the pool get paid. This is an intriguing example of smart contracts being used to bypass or change the consensus of a platform. It‚Äôs DeFi and community participation in action.

You can find the pool at erg.ezpool.io. There are plans to implement the Stratum protocol and efficient mining software after the pool launches.

If you‚Äôd like to find out more about the theory behind pool mining on Ergo, we have an academic paper that was presented at Financial Cryptography 2020.

That‚Äôs all for now ‚Äì but stay tuned, because we have more developments on the way!


[05/14/2020 8:07 PM] mx#5165
@kushti i think we should edit some that part


[05/14/2020 8:10 PM] mx#5165
erg.ezpool.io is actually pool that bypassed protection against ordinary pools design üôÇ


[05/14/2020 8:11 PM] mx#5165
we should also change first mining pool to maybe censorship resistant pool with collaterals


[05/14/2020 8:14 PM] mx#5165
@Dmitry Usov please delete "You can find the pool at erg.ezpool.io."


[05/14/2020 8:26 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134

some questions:
1) is it possible to autofocus cursor on the text box after clicking Search icon in the header?
2) when I search for special names (like GraalVM) it shows the results, even though the name is present on the blog

[07/15/2020 8:47 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I think it would be much better to include some information about the core devs like the team page had previously. And include links to their Linked in profiles and github, maybe not for everyone but at least the core devs.


[07/15/2020 8:48 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Especially when we have kushti and catena with excellent credentials and experience. A shame not to showcase that!


[07/15/2020 8:51 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
for @kushti profile I suggest we have a link that goes to another separate page for his bio, which could be something like this (this is from last year so maybe a bit outdated):

...maybe also for some of the other devs, depending on their experience. But if not a separate page for each dev at least links to their profile on some other platform such as Linked-in or Github.


[07/15/2020 8:53 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I think the strong background of the team is a core selling point. A shame not to be highlighting that.

Whenever I'm researching a new token or coin, I'm very interested in the team behind it.


[07/15/2020 8:56 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
And for me its a big red flag when a team web-page doesn't have details about the core dev members, seems like they are trying to hide, in my view.


[07/15/2020 2:48 PM] Robert K#0722
I personally agree with Noah, that it would be a good idea to keep that strong background visible, at least until Ergo has become widely popular and it's less of an issue.


[07/15/2020 2:53 PM] kushti#0978
Okay I'm open to it


[07/15/2020 2:53 PM] kushti#0978
Would it be like text links after a name?


[07/15/2020 2:53 PM] kushti#0978
Like kushti (github linkedin ...)


[07/16/2020 2:12 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Yes, like it was in  the old team page last year with text links (github, linkedin, Twitter) and profile picture. No need for everyone to have pics, but at least the key devs.

[07/16/2020 2:14 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I think the pics are important because it adds to the feeling that the platform is legit. The devs are open about exactly who they are, so less likely to  be scammers. Of course ok for anyone who does not want too many details disclosed.


[07/16/2020 2:17 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
In addition to github, linkedin & Twitter links, I think for key people, especially @kushti  and probably also @Dmitry Meshkov , there should be an additional link which directs to his personal bio page (can link out to external page or to new sub page under ergoplatform.org).


[07/18/2020 10:55 AM] Dmitry Usov#0134

[07/27/2020 1:12 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
> I think need to rework top menu. Make it with sections. What do you think guys?
@Dmitry Usov Currently each item on the homepage top menu (About / Foundation / News / FAQ....) has no drop-down menu. Do you mean to make drop down menu (sub-items) for each main item (with also possibly changing the name of the top line items?


[07/27/2020 1:12 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I would agree with that.


[07/27/2020 1:13 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Also I think we should have the list of exchanges as a menu or sub-menu item so that it is easier to find. Right now it is not so intuitive to find under About / Get Ergo.


[07/27/2020 9:06 AM] Dmitry Usov#0134

[07/28/2020 3:00 PM] Robert K#0722
I've gotten little feedback about joining the EF and have barely heard anything, and this article just gets pushed out. We could have timed this with Emurgo marketing team to get a bit bigger of a public push as it's essentially building out the Emurgo partnership further.


[07/28/2020 3:02 PM] Robert K#0722
Instead this just got released without much attention, and it wasn't really used for it's full potential.


[07/28/2020 3:05 PM] Robert K#0722
If we want Ergo to grow we kind of need to work on how content is disseminated, as there's a lot of great content being released, but it seems that it tends not to be utilized the most effectively and reach is very limited.

@Robert K sorry, it was actually to be posted last friday after voting results of members were in, it was also nomination from the board so some coordination might look strange before voting results, as for marketing i also hope it will go as you say when possible, there is small group of supporters doing different activities, hopefully you will be connected with them shortly and hopefully we will have also some role of marketing coordinator soon, so far @kushti is fullfilling it in the meantime

Good resource


[08/26/2020 2:18 PM] Robert K#0722
I was thinking on ergoplatform.org we could add a "Getting Started" page. This could be a good place to provide key links for anyone looking to jump right in

Sections I was thinking would be a good idea:
- Setting Up A Wallet (full node instructions/full node script/video, links to all wallets)
- Writing Smart Contacts ( @scalahub's great new wiki page, the ergoscript papers, the ergoscript lang spec https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/blob/develop/docs/LangSpec.md, ...)
- Getting Started Mining (setup instructions, ...)


[08/26/2020 2:20 PM] Robert K#0722
It's kind of similar to the current "About" page, but it'd be more easy to find for newbies (idk how many people click on About pages first) and it would be a bit more detailed/be more up to date with latest docs/links that are useful.


[08/26/2020 2:28 PM] morphic#4133
I think Getting Started should start with simple things on top of the page and more complex towards the end. 
- Select and setup wallet
- Exchange and trading options
- Setup a full node
- Estimate mining profitability
- Mining options and setup
- Existing applications (Mixer, Multisig, etc)
- Intro to Smart Contacts
- Advanced Contracts (pools, etc)


[08/26/2020 2:28 PM] scalahub#2618
The current wiki home page is blank.. maybe we could do it there


[08/26/2020 2:29 PM] Robert K#0722
The problem is no one can find the wiki, most people aren't devs and it's not the simplest thing to click through in github.


[08/26/2020 2:30 PM] Robert K#0722
@morphic That's a fair way to organize it as well. I think we just need a page called Getting Started which we can link to for anyone to jump right in.


[08/26/2020 2:33 PM] morphic#4133
> @morphic That's a fair way to organize it as well. I think we just need a page called Getting Started which we can link to for anyone to jump right in.
@Robert K looks like renaming About -> Getting Started will do most of the job


[08/26/2020 2:34 PM] morphic#4133
It already have 4 steps


[08/26/2020 2:44 PM] Robert K#0722
Ah yeah, and it's even called getting started on the home page.


[08/26/2020 3:07 PM] morphic#4133
@Dmitry Usov could you please rename About -> Getting Started (see discussion above)


[08/26/2020 3:10 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134

@Dmitry Usov hi! these are blog posts from June 30th and June 11th in Chinese translated by Gary. Please post them to the website as soon as possible. One more should be ready tomorrow. these three are the more important ones we thought.


[09/07/2020 3:18 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
okay, no problem, I will put it now


[09/07/2020 3:19 PM] Justin1000#9555
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ please post the Chinese versions or somehow market them on our chinese channels. I recommend doing June 11th tomorrow and then doing June 30th on Wednesday and the other one thursday to space them out by a day. maybe relevant for getting some Chinese mindshare when talking to exchanges.

[09/19/2020 9:31 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
We do not have Chinese translation for the explorer. We want to translate the explorer into Chinese. But first it we need to know where is the Github page for the explorer page? When we have that, we can use it to translate the English into Chinese.


[09/19/2020 9:32 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
We need the English version of the explorer in a format that we can edit. Then we can make it in Chinese.

@Dmitry Usov This was a forum post by Robert. But can you post it to the Chinese website under latest news or blog in Chinese (no need to have same in English website)? We think its great comparison of Chainlink vs Oracle Pools and good for the Chinese user to try and figure out what makes Ergo special.

Also in the FAQ on Ergo website, under "Mining" we have  https://ergoplatform.org/en/faq/
```Ergo is based on Autolykos PoW puzzle, that is the first PoW puzzle that is memory-hard and pool-resistant. This means that you need a configured Ergo node and GPU with at least 4 Gb of memory (while 8 Gb is recommended for maximum efficiency). Use this guide to configure miner together with the node. Note, that you may employ many GPUs together on one Ergo node.```

and 
```Ergo was created with the idea to achieve maximum resiliency through decentralization. Autolykos consensus protocol plays an important role in the network's decentralization, as far as it does not allow mining pools. Check Autolykos specification for more details.```

Is it possible for someone to add Eva Qing#8318 to this channel?


[05/16/2021 4:39 AM] Justin1000#9555
The Chinese website is in really dire shape right now. Probably people are super busy with other things that are much higher priority given not many people come to our Chinese website but would be good to update it anyway if have time. Sometimes I think some important people from exchanges, funds or pools might go to it...


[05/16/2021 4:40 AM] Justin1000#9555
Maybe Eva can put here the Chinese news, blog posts etc and say where it goes.


[05/16/2021 4:41 AM] Justin1000#9555
Also would be good to try and eliminate all English on the Chinese website (like menu drop downs etc) but I guess this could make things more time consuming.


[05/16/2021 4:43 AM] Justin1000#9555
not highest priority but to extent have time, i would recommend updating it...

Sorry. I am not familiar with the operations of this APP. I am wondering how to add DeadIT.


[05/17/2021 9:42 AM] Justin1000#9555
DeadIT is here


[05/17/2021 9:42 AM] Justin1000#9555
He is in charge of website updates. In the past what we did was just drop word version of Chinese translation of website news or blog post and he would update it


[05/17/2021 9:43 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think it would be good to take it a step further this time and get the menus translated and everything but I don't want to push too hard but people are busy on more important things


[05/17/2021 9:44 AM] Justin1000#9555
But in near future at least can get the news and blog posts translated and updated


[05/17/2021 9:44 AM] Justin1000#9555
And whitepapers...


[05/17/2021 9:44 AM] Eva Qing#8318
@Dmitry Usov Hi. DeadIT. Sorry. Recently, I have been busying with helping UP (our new Chinese community organizer who has collected approx. 900 people to  WeChat groups in the recent ten days, now he is organizing another new WeChat group which has 90 people already) push the ERG price go up again and again by collecting information and writing and publishing Chinese news or articles. I will try my best to post Chinese articles or news  here and request you to publish them whenever I am available.


[05/17/2021 9:44 AM] Justin1000#9555
Then can take care of rest...


[05/17/2021 9:48 AM] Eva Qing#8318
In my opinion, giving support for UP is the most important job I have to do now. Chinese people generally go to Jinse Finance to read articles about Ergo there. Many of them even don't read articles on Jinse but directly go to Gateio Exchange to buy ERGs after Up shares the information on Ergo with them.


[05/17/2021 9:50 AM] Justin1000#9555
We already discussed  all this.


[05/17/2021 9:50 AM] Justin1000#9555
The website should be updated.


[05/17/2021 9:50 AM] Justin1000#9555
Don't know why we are discussing it again


[05/17/2021 9:53 AM] Eva Qing#8318
I just made an explanation here why Chinese articles were not posted on Chinese website because I have placed my efforts on community promotion. I will post Chinese articles in future to publish them on the website.

I think all news and blogs should be updated no later than end of June. Assuming DeadIT is okay the rest of website including menus and white papers should all be in Chinese and well maintained by end of July. Its important for Ergo's image so if you have to spend less time with Up in order to get it done, fine. If you need another person then you can write a short proposal to foundation after you find someone...thanks


[05/17/2021 10:05 AM] Eva Qing#8318
OK.


[05/17/2021 10:07 AM] Eva Qing#8318
I think our English website should be updated first. Actually, most of English blogs have been translated and published on Jinse. We just need to repost them on our website. I will prepare a list of articles to be published.

Hi, @Eva Qing, when you address the message to someone, you can use @ before the name, so that he gets notified (see how I used it before your name). Otherwise, chances are the messages get lost, because we have a lot of them in different channels these days.

@Eva Qing - Dmitry has asked me to do it. Few questions

1- are these all for the blog section
2-do you want these all uploaded at once? or staggered?


[05/21/2021 8:59 AM] Eva Qing#8318
@glasgowm most of them are for blog sections, some articles marked as news are for news section. You can upload them all at once based on the number of every article.


[05/21/2021 9:12 AM] glasgowm#9381

[05/21/2021 9:14 AM] glasgowm#9381
Think we need to get someone who speaks access on the CMS though. I can't tell if I'm breaking the formatting because it's in .docx and not markdown (.md)

Also all the images are embedded in word, so would need to be extracted, reuploaded and relinked manually I think (I guess there might be a way to automate it)


[05/21/2021 9:21 AM] glasgowm#9381
ok I've got it extracting with pandoc. But would still need someone to fix up the formatting in the cms if possible. Might be ok though

@glasgowm Kucoin will read this article.


[05/21/2021 10:13 AM] glasgowm#9381
Please see above @Eva Qing - you need someone who speaks Chinese on the CMS. I don't have the time to go through 50k words and fix the formatting in an unknown language. Heading up north right now and not back til Sunday when I can look more into automating it but you will still need someone to fix them up if I get them in as it's provided in the wrong format and wont translate exactly (lists, bullet points, etc)


[05/27/2021 10:34 AM] Eva Qing#8318
@glasgowm Sorry. I don't know how to solve the problem. Do you mean that I need to ask a Chinese developer for help?


[05/27/2021 10:38 AM] glasgowm#9381
You need someone who speaks Chinese and has 2FA. Doesn't need to be a developer, just needs needs to know Chinese. The system is very simple but I have no idea where a headline stops and ends, or how to fix any of the other formatting errors that will be introduced by trying to copy over such large amounts of text.

Hi ergoplatform.org,
I have discovered another misconfiguaration, I detected that weak ciphers are enabled during secure communication (SSL) which allow users to be subjected to mitm attacks.

Description
Weak ciphers allow hackers to decrypt ssl communication between your server and visitors, You should allow only strong ciphers on your web server to protect secure communication with your visitors.

Proof Of Concept
A screenshot is attached

Steps To Reproduce
-Go to https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html
-Paste the domain's url

Proof Of Concept
A screenshot is attached.

Remediation
Configure your web server to disallow using weak ciphers.

Impact
Allows hackers to decrypt ssl traffic
MITM Attacks

Looking forward to your response

Regards
Zohaib
```

```
 As you have not responded to any of my vulnerability reports I am assuming that your website and its user's security is not your priority. Please allow me to do write ups of these findings on my blog for educational purposes.

Looking forward to your email

Regards
Zohaib
