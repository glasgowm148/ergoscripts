@CW happy to be added on tweet deck for this acct so we can get this moving forward asap. Will read up on editorial guide and make a copy of it and start firing out some initial tweets as gov moves forward so the public can see more. Once more people join we can onboard them and not have to start from scratch during the hustle. wdyt?


[11/14/2022 12:49 AM] CW#8500
Yep, once i get the handle i can swap it over.

Just to reiterate once more also, like you mentioned access will be granted through Tweet Deck. We are doing it this way incase anything unforeseen happens with Ergo_Platform account we have this one to fall back on.


[11/14/2022 12:51 AM] drehaf#0090
makes sense üòâ


[11/14/2022 12:52 AM] drehaf#0090
thanks for doing all this üôÇ much appreciated!


[11/14/2022 12:53 AM] CW#8500 (pinned)
The way i see Sigmanauts utilizing this account is highlighting the Sigmanaut endeavors but also everything going on in the Ergo ecosystem. Liking, retweeting project and community tweets etc, I guess over all bringing as much awareness to the ecosystem as possible


[11/14/2022 12:54 AM] drehaf#0090
yup, i think that's a great capture and good enough to pin üòâ

@Sigmanauts 
Whoever is interested please read the style guide above. Twitter has been updated with the logo/banner for now. I'm studying the style guide and will slowly start engaging (liking other posts, retweet, and eventually start posting) as CW has extended tweet deck access to me.

Can anyone with moderation privilege on r/ergonauts pin something new for us like the summit post? The Cardano/Ergo Twitter chat is 4 days old now.

FYI Kill it with coffee (new sigcan) has volunteered to take a look at on-boarding docs. I've given him some direction to map out the current documentation so we can get a handle on it and really focus on an introduction page that leaves the reader with a clear idea of what they are getting in to (which current does, it sounds like cafe's style) AND knows where to go. That means that some really good current separate pages that cafe and others have worked on might be merged with the initial page to help with that message. To put in a list his direction is:
1. Map out the current documentation
2. Find what needs to be finished (some spots are empty)
3. Work on a front page that if the reader stopped there would have a good idea of who to talk to, what holes to look to fill, and where they might be able to jump in. Then, the other pages can be much more detailed as the sigmanauts are able to better define and manage things that need to get done.
