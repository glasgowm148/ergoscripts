Topic: We want to develop a profit swapping smart contract that can be used with any mining pool - smartpool or otherwise - to swap profits via ErgoDex. In this way, a miner is free from the burden of doing manual swaps and is saved from the additional taxable event.

Hello, here are some updates:

1. Included are updated documents for the proposal and protocol spec, feel free to check them out and give feedback if you are interested.
2. We have a UI layout but no front-end dev(s) yet. However, having a functional website is not our goal for the hackathon.
3. Our goal for this hackathon is to have a CLI program with the essential functions. I will update what these are exactly before the hackathon begins.
4. We have a twitter and github, feel free to follow if you want. Both are empty though. For the github, I will include a description later about how I want to organize/manage the repository to keep everything as organized as possible.

Thanks! How will you deal with swaps that get stuck due to slippage?


[02/11/2022 1:10 PM] lgd#5847
Not 100% sure, idk if I figured this out. I think I might have omitted this. I will need to access the pool box and calculate the necessary information before actually creating the swap, this is true to make sure I have the right price and token. So I guess it could be "checked" before sending. I'm not sure if this completely addresses the problem.


[02/11/2022 1:13 PM] Luivatra#9076
Fair enough üôÇ Think @Ilya | Spectrum would be best to verify your proxy contract


[02/11/2022 1:15 PM] lgd#5847
Yes, I posted in ErgoDex discord actually the other day. Was trying to understand part of their code. They add the same constant twice but at different index in ergotree.


[02/11/2022 3:41 PM] Ilya | Spectrum#0494
Constants duplication is a consequence of ErgoScript design. When translating source code from ErgoScript the compiler doesn‚Äôt know how to deduplicate some constants. The only way of fixing it is manual modification of ErgoTree.


[02/11/2022 3:42 PM] Ilya | Spectrum#0494
We have this task in backlog, but it‚Äôs not in priority


[02/11/2022 4:47 PM] lgd#5847
Thanks. 
So in this picture:
1. When you say duplicated, do you mean because you use the constant multiple times in the contract? If so, then why is BaseAmount only copied twice if used three times in the swapSell contract?
2. What is the difference between SwapSellSample and SwapSellTemplate?

Any help needed ?


[02/11/2022 6:26 PM] lgd#5847
Would appreciate someone looking over the proxy contract though. For two of the constants in the script, I would like to hard code the ergotree, which I then use to check as propbytes of output box. How would I obtain this from the ergoscript contract?


[02/11/2022 8:08 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
You can take the sample swapsell ergotree that ergodex provided, take the propositionBytes from the ergotree, then substitute and check if outputs has same propBytes.


[02/11/2022 8:13 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I think there are some ergoscript functions you can use to decode ergotree string into propBytes at compile time but not sure.


[02/11/2022 8:14 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
If not you can always parse the ErgoTree off chain and then add the propBytes as a constant in the script.


[02/11/2022 8:35 PM] lgd#5847
Yeah I guess I thought it would be cool to swap the vars in the script itself. For the servicefeecontract, I would just compile that in the ergoscript playground for example and use the address as propbytes?


[02/11/2022 8:43 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Not entirely sure what is needed for that contract. Its just an address youre going to be sending the fees too?


[02/11/2022 8:46 PM] lgd#5847
yeah basically, but controlled by a contract bc there are three of us. i was just gonna wait until it's filled with some threshold amount and can be spent by any three of us but will only get 1/3 for example


[02/11/2022 8:48 PM] lgd#5847
What's in the contract doesn't really matter, it's just about getting the propbytes so I can use it as a condition in the proxy contract

I'm in EST so it's still early for me, I will prob keep going until 11pm EST so like 4AM UTC
done:
- finished proxy contract
- determined commands to be used for program
- finished format of guapswap_config.json and proxy_addresses.json
- working on config objects for storing user settings from json files
will be done today:
- contract for service fee
- consolidating all the necessary pool and token constants
- implementing the generate command

[02/13/2022 12:25 AM] lgd#5847
@Cheese Enthusiast I stored the poolId as strings, but when I retrieve them they are TokenId, but seems no way to convert both ways


[02/13/2022 12:26 AM] lgd#5847
@Cheese Enthusiast said he would lend me the getblok testnet node to use, but in general i don't know where to find this information


[02/13/2022 12:26 AM] kii#8888
To answer that, you dont need an api key. You can call the node and interact with it


[02/13/2022 12:26 AM] kii#8888
are you developing in scala


[02/13/2022 12:27 AM] lgd#5847
yeah, kushti answered that part of the question. but in general, where can we find ips for public nodes?


[02/13/2022 12:28 AM] kii#8888
the one that kushti has spinned up is pretty reliable: url = "http://213.239.193.208:9053/"


[02/13/2022 12:28 AM] kii#8888
but if you want you can spin up your own node. I dont think you'd need an api key to interact


[02/13/2022 12:28 AM] kii#8888
the api key is needed for private interactions


[02/13/2022 12:28 AM] lgd#5847

[02/13/2022 12:51 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
They should essentially be the same thing, a collection of bytes. So parse the hex string into bytes, then use it as a context var with the input.
