Mine Ergo From Your Own Node, Zero Pool Fees
Follow along in this video to get a node going on your local network, followed by a stratum server, then mine to it! Avoid pool fees and help to further decentralize Ergo. This was all done on a fresh install of windows 10 pro that was fully updated.

I followed the process to mine Solo Here: https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Mining-Ergo-after-The-Hardening-Upgrade And when I run NVMiner I get

[09/08/2021 2:48 PM] stinkybuttguy#4677
Any suggestions?


[09/08/2021 3:42 PM] andee#4722
you should be connecting to the proxy, not directly to the node


[09/10/2021 10:22 PM] CollegeKids#3993
Guys is there a step by step guide on how to mine this for newbies ??!!


[09/11/2021 1:26 AM] howard#4394
I think the easiest way will be nanopool https://github.com/nanopool/nanominer


[09/11/2021 1:27 AM] howard#4394
just setup your wallet then start miner


[09/11/2021 6:39 AM] Doomelf#7740
dont do nanopool. That is the last place you want to mine


[09/11/2021 6:40 AM] Doomelf#7740
Any other pools are ok. Can still use nanominer program if you wish or others


[09/11/2021 6:40 AM] Doomelf#7740
nano just has to much hash over there


[09/11/2021 9:31 PM] shinyumbreon#2454
Can you setup a node and mine solo on hive os?


[09/11/2021 9:33 PM] andee#4722
yes, but I wouldn't run the node on hiveos


[09/11/2021 9:34 PM] shinyumbreon#2454
So setup the node on windows and mine on a separate rig?


[09/11/2021 9:37 PM] andee#4722
if you know how to get windows to not reboot because of updates etc, sure


[09/11/2021 9:38 PM] andee#4722
I wouldn't trust any mnemonics on hiveos


[09/11/2021 9:39 PM] shinyumbreon#2454
How should I attempt this then ?


[09/11/2021 9:39 PM] shinyumbreon#2454
Or are you saying I should just solo mine on a pool?


[09/11/2021 9:41 PM] andee#4722
please stick to one channel when you are asking questions, if someone knows the answer you will get it


[09/11/2021 9:41 PM] andee#4722
node on computer 1, mining on computer 2


[09/11/2021 9:42 PM] andee#4722
if you're not familiar with solo mining with your own node I would just stick to a pool


[09/11/2021 9:42 PM] shinyumbreon#2454
What os do you recommend for the solo node


[09/11/2021 9:42 PM] andee#4722
https://github.com/mhssamadani/ErgoStratumServer


[09/11/2021 9:43 PM] andee#4722
I only use windows very rarely for gaming, so my only rec. is Linux


[09/11/2021 9:43 PM] shinyumbreon#2454
Gotcha. Thanks for the info


[09/11/2021 9:46 PM] andee#4722
linux wont reboot by itself, its just a lot easier for stuff that should be running 24/7


[09/11/2021 9:46 PM] andee#4722
someone made a guide for running the node on a raspberry pi, that might work as a mining node


[09/12/2021 5:20 AM] BuzzLiteBeer#8676
Hey shoot me a DM with your questions and I can try to help you, I made the pi guide and the windows one. Now that I know a lot more about solo mining I do not recommend it to anyone with less than 10GH.


[09/13/2021 10:23 PM] Admin (Fairhash.org)#6766
on our pool there are not many miners yet, almost solo! üôÇ


[09/15/2021 7:07 PM] howard#4394
so any other pool to recommand?


[09/15/2021 7:21 PM] Doomelf#7740
@howard i like Wooly and Enigma


[09/15/2021 7:22 PM] howard#4394
Just curious, what's the difference between Wooly and Nano?


[09/16/2021 12:55 AM] Peeved#0730
Nanopool has like 48% of hashrate, if it goes to 51% they can hurt the network, other than that basically nothing but I recommend flypool as it's also the same but has no fees for the next 2 weeks or so


[09/16/2021 11:06 AM] 0xAdam#8754
i have a 2080 ti and a ryzen 9 3950x do you think that will do ?


[09/16/2021 11:07 AM] 0xAdam#8754
does anyone know if i can run one of these on a VM ?


[09/16/2021 3:07 PM] BuzzLiteBeer#8676
Its just the GPU that can mine ergo, and yeah the 2080TI should be fine.


[09/16/2021 3:14 PM] pieter#3957
Is solo mining without a pool?


[09/16/2021 3:16 PM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
mining your own node or pool


[09/16/2021 3:17 PM] pieter#3957
Is that even profitable?


[09/16/2021 3:17 PM] pieter#3957
Or are you running huge farm?


[09/16/2021 3:22 PM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
small operations what is 2%?  If you're a huge farm, 2% is significant.


[09/16/2021 5:23 PM] BuzzLiteBeer#8676
Small Operations should not solo mine. I wouldn't try it with less than 10gh.


[09/17/2021 3:45 PM] boomer#0823
Yeah, to share some "back of the napkin math" for solo mining, take your hashrate (in TH) and divide that by the total mining power of ERGO (about 41 TH atm) and that's your chance at mining any individual block at THIS specific moment in time. For a single GPU, it's something like 1 in 500,000 which means it'd take about 3 years (at 2 mins/block) to mine one. This math also assumes the difficulty and the total hashrate does not increase during that time frame (which is does, meaning your chances continue to decrease over time and it's likely you'll never mine a block). Of course, you could get lucky but don't count on it. 10GHs is a good number to start with. üôÇ


[09/17/2021 3:59 PM] apexpool#3878
I believe you are wrong. the current hashrate is 30.58 TH/s, so with 1 GH/s you should get 1 block in about 42 days in average.


[09/17/2021 4:01 PM] boomer#0823
I was going off of what I saw yesterday on this site. https://ergoplatform.org/en/mining/ Is there somewhere else I should be looking at the network hashrate?

[09/17/2021 5:14 PM] boomer#0823
I see on Minerstat the network hashrate is showing about 30TH/s. I'm not sure which is the better source but either way, it's still very unlikely to mine a block if you're solo mining with a single 2080TI getting 100MH/s. üôÇ


[09/18/2021 4:11 PM] -[Art e fakt]-#3785
is this solo mining on node now? what GH do you prefer? ty

[09/18/2021 8:41 PM] boomer#0823
A good target is to set it so your difficulty so your miner is sending shares to your node every 15 seconds on average. From there, you can tweak that setting up or down to use more or free up network bandwidth. If you notice that your miner is constantly needing to reconnect, try lowering the difficulty so your miner sends shares more frequently. As for my preferred hashrate, the higher the better (without damaging your hardware). Also, see the comments above about the chances of getting any rewards at all as a SOLO miner with only 100Mh/s. You might have better luck jumping in a pool while you build out your rig.


[09/18/2021 8:51 PM] -[Art e fakt]-#3785
Oh thanks a lot. I mean this is just a test card. I mine on ergo Pool With 3,5 Gh atm. I Hope to increase my luck in Solo mining on my own node.


[09/18/2021 9:11 PM] -[Art e fakt]-#3785
Bit What do you mean? How do i know my difficult? Can u explain me how to calculate my difficult?


[09/18/2021 9:32 PM] boomer#0823
The first yellow circle from your picture is the difficulty. I haven't tried to set difficulty on just the node before but if you install the Ergo Stratum Server, you can set it in the config (start.js) and mine to that stratum server with a miner like t-rex or NBMiner.


[09/18/2021 9:32 PM] boomer#0823
The one that says 29GH


[09/18/2021 9:34 PM] boomer#0823
Good luck with your solo mining!

i think there is some problem in min and max diff


[09/19/2021 10:13 AM] andee#4722
use static diff instead


[09/19/2021 9:32 PM] Admin (Fairhash.org)#6766
join us, we are small pool, for you will be almost solo! üôÇ ergo.fairhash.org . From your logs one see that you submit the share every second, that is not good - estimate the diff to be such that you submit share every 30 sec, not more often. If you will find the block you will anyway submit it

Hey guys i'm new here and just started a project to mine ergo... I really like the project and would like to mine ergo and just hodl for the next five years... So I have a lot of questions, but for now lets just get the basic stuff out of the way: 1- Is it a good Idea to buy 10 GeForce RTX 3080 Ti at the same time or Is it better to start things off with 5 and then build from there?


[09/20/2021 5:01 PM] darpydon#0007
2- what pool would you guys recommend me for solo mining.


[09/20/2021 5:02 PM] Herk#6019
there's a good pool on #‚õè‚îÇmining


[09/20/2021 5:02 PM] darpydon#0007
3- Other than the GPU's what would be a good set up (motherboards, Ram, etc) for this specific Graphic card?


[09/20/2021 5:03 PM] darpydon#0007
oh thanks!


[09/20/2021 5:03 PM] Herk#6019
as for the rest, if you've never done it before


[09/20/2021 5:03 PM] Herk#6019
it's best to start with 1


[09/20/2021 5:04 PM] darpydon#0007
I'm planning on setting this up on EU and this is my first time mining


[09/20/2021 5:04 PM] darpydon#0007
I have a whole room to do this and the electricity is not a problem


[09/20/2021 5:05 PM] Herk#6019
plenty of options when it comes to this, if you need some help you'll be better off working out something by yourself and then asking for advice around here imo


[09/20/2021 5:06 PM] darpydon#0007
my goal is to reach over 2K mh/s


[09/20/2021 5:06 PM] Herk#6019

[09/20/2021 5:06 PM] darpydon#0007
one last question!


[09/20/2021 5:07 PM] darpydon#0007
what is the diff between those 2?

These server are for SOLO mining btw


[09/20/2021 5:09 PM] darpydon#0007
wait are those the total amount of gpu's in  each server?


[09/20/2021 5:10 PM] Jeff9610#8088
My total hash is 1.9G and will it be good for solo mining?


[09/20/2021 5:10 PM] Herk#6019
it's the difficulty


[09/20/2021 5:11 PM] Herk#6019
don't worry about that now


[09/20/2021 5:12 PM] darpydon#0007
I see, the less difficulty the better right? or does it pays more rewards depending on what difficulty you're mining in?


[09/20/2021 5:13 PM] darpydon#0007
I know most of those question I can find on google, just being lazy sorry LOL


[09/20/2021 5:14 PM] Herk#6019
that doesn't affect rewards


[09/20/2021 5:14 PM] Herk#6019
I believe 2miners explains it if you feel like learning more about it

[09/23/2021 6:50 AM] XG multani#8464
Hi Guys, My Question is ..... what happens if my mining rig restart in Solo mining ? In my country there is a lot of electricity shortfall . So when my rig restart should i be able to continue from where i left ? Thanks


[09/23/2021 7:14 AM] andee#4722
solo mining is not a progressing process


[09/23/2021 2:33 PM] Kricket#5460
Your ‚ÄúCurrent Solo Effort‚Äù percentage will pick up right where you left off, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking.  You can even stop for a couple of days and that percentage will remain when you log back in as a solo miner.


[09/24/2021 5:40 AM] Driss#0598
Solo mining is probabilistic, doesn't depend on progress, more on luck and submitting the share to win the block


[09/24/2021 10:07 AM] XG multani#8464
Means if i left at 10% and logged back then it will start from where i left ? Or it will pick another block ?


[09/24/2021 12:00 PM] andee#4722
you are always hashing to get the current block, there is no progress. effort is just an indicator to see if you found it earlier or later


[09/24/2021 12:01 PM] andee#4722
depending on hashrate you can go 6 months without a block or find 5 on the same day


[09/24/2021 1:52 PM] mikeez#4664
Hi Guys, can somebody give me a hint where i made mistake? I would like to try to solo mining but with my node so i have installed node, ErgoStartumServer and proxy


[09/24/2021 1:53 PM] mikeez#4664
Node is synched Stratumserver & proxy are working


[09/24/2021 1:53 PM] mikeez#4664
I can authorize with my miner but I do not find any shares at all


[09/24/2021 2:05 PM] andee#4722
adjust share diff. you are most likely mining at netdiff, so your miner will submit a share if it finds the solution for a block


[09/24/2021 2:05 PM] mikeez#4664
what figures I am looking for?


[09/24/2021 2:06 PM] andee#4722
its under "ports"


[09/24/2021 2:11 PM] mikeez#4664
I was thnking this value will be passed from the network difficulty


[09/24/2021 2:12 PM] mikeez#4664
I found it, "diff": 1643198652874752. How I should know which diff will fit for now?


[09/24/2021 2:16 PM] Kricket#5460
Holy crap I mined a block overnight!


[09/24/2021 2:17 PM] mikeez#4664
congrats


[09/24/2021 2:20 PM] mikeez#4664
andee from my understanding if my value is lower than that it will take net diff


[09/24/2021 2:21 PM] andee#4722
lower diff shares are used by pools to be able to estimate the miners hashrate so they get paid fairly


[09/24/2021 2:21 PM] mikeez#4664
got you


[09/24/2021 2:21 PM] andee#4722
use static diff and play with the setting


[09/24/2021 2:21 PM] mikeez#4664
for what numer I am looking?


[09/24/2021 2:22 PM] mikeez#4664
*number


[09/24/2021 2:22 PM] andee#4722
```        "3256": { //Another port for your miners to connect to, this port does not use varDiff
            "diff": 256 //The pool difficulty
        }```


[09/24/2021 2:23 PM] andee#4722
set diff to 1 and take it from there


[09/24/2021 2:23 PM] andee#4722
if you get kicked out because of too many low diff shares, increase


[09/24/2021 2:24 PM] andee#4722
what is meant by the explanation is that if your maxdiff is higher than netdiff, netdiff will be used


[09/24/2021 2:31 PM] mikeez#4664
Just did the change and same thing


[09/24/2021 2:35 PM] mikeez#4664
I can see miner is working MHS is visible but no shares at all


[09/24/2021 2:52 PM] mikeez#4664
did I miss something?


[09/24/2021 3:08 PM] andee#4722
did you connect to the port you edited?


[09/24/2021 3:09 PM] andee#4722
most miners show the share diff


[09/24/2021 3:10 PM] mikeez#4664
yes I did


[09/24/2021 3:54 PM] mikeez#4664
Could be that possible that I try to connect directly to stratum port instead of proxy?


[09/24/2021 4:25 PM] mikeez#4664
humm


[09/24/2021 5:00 PM] mikeez#4664
I think It was related to this diff i changed it again and it works


[09/24/2021 5:06 PM] mikeez#4664
just to make sure I am on right track


[09/24/2021 5:12 PM] mikeez#4664
stratum server shows me valid shares which equals miner stats however proxy shows me Accepted shares: 0


[09/24/2021 5:13 PM] mikeez#4664
is this right?


[09/24/2021 5:32 PM] andee#4722
proxy is only for the open source miners


[09/24/2021 5:39 PM] mikeez#4664
I first time mine to my pool and in my opinion i see quickness and more shares maybe I am wrong is there any way that I could browse some statistics like on solo "comercial" pools?


[09/24/2021 9:27 PM] mikeez#4664
How I can figure out how much accepted/rejects shares i have mining to own node?


[09/24/2021 10:07 PM] andee#4722
all miners report this


[09/24/2021 10:07 PM] mikeez#4664
so can relay only on miners stats?


[09/24/2021 10:07 PM] mikeez#4664
I can*


[09/24/2021 10:08 PM] andee#4722
stratum server tells miner if a share is accepted or not


[09/24/2021 10:09 PM] mikeez#4664
yeah it is clear for me but I was asking if I can somehow track it to have general overview?


[09/24/2021 10:09 PM] mikeez#4664
like some kind of statistics?


[09/24/2021 10:13 PM] andee#4722
check your miners docs, most of them can serve a local webpage with stats


[09/24/2021 10:13 PM] mikeez#4664
when I was mining solo in pool my hashrate from miner was different than pool's one


[09/24/2021 10:15 PM] mikeez#4664
I was thkinking about save stratum server log into file and grep valid shares but there is not timestamp


[09/24/2021 10:25 PM] andee#4722
when looking at pool hashrate you need 6/12/24 hour average, and it is still only an indicator


[09/24/2021 10:26 PM] andee#4722
if you compare shares between pools you also need to take share difficulty into consideration


[09/25/2021 9:18 AM] mikeez#4664
Andee, how I may know if i setup this diff correct? I mean everything is working but just to make sure I am not mining the air?


[09/25/2021 9:21 AM] andee#4722
as long as your shares are not rejected you should be good to go

[09/25/2021 9:24 AM] mikeez#4664
so I guess now need to wait for a luck?


[09/25/2021 9:57 AM] andee#4722
there is no point in having so low diff that you spam the server


[09/25/2021 9:57 AM] andee#4722
more shares != bigger chance of block


[09/25/2021 10:11 AM] mikeez#4664
thats why I asked


[09/25/2021 10:13 AM] mikeez#4664
what would be recommendation then?


[09/25/2021 10:16 AM] mikeez#4664
maybe I should add this are accepted shares are from yesterday when i started mining


[09/25/2021 10:50 AM] andee#4722
personal preference, I would have mined at netdiff so 1 share = 1 block


[09/25/2021 11:00 AM] mikeez#4664
this would be default setup right?


[09/25/2021 11:01 AM] andee#4722
yes


[09/25/2021 11:03 AM] mikeez#4664
so means that I only will see valid share if this will be the right one


[09/25/2021 11:30 AM] mikeez#4664
i have changed as it was to defaut and now i got low diffucility share msg


[09/25/2021 11:30 AM] mikeez#4664
I am puzzled now


[09/25/2021 11:41 AM] mikeez#4664
I had to lower max diff so netdiff would be applied, correct?


[09/25/2021 11:48 AM] mikeez#4664
Andee, can you confirm if i will mine to 3256 port it will work as you said?


[09/25/2021 12:34 PM] andee#4722
that depends on your config. setting diff lower than netdiff will not result in netdiff shares


[09/26/2021 12:06 PM] Boldimore#5357

I‚Äôm right above 3 GH


[09/26/2021 6:36 PM] Kricket#5460
I switched to conflux to test the waters there and scoop up some of those coins, but I‚Äôll be switching back to ERG in a few days - maybe a week.  The block afforded me some time to experiment.


[09/26/2021 6:37 PM] Kricket#5460
I‚Äôm going to switch back to ETH shortly after though - ride that wave til I can‚Äôt anymore.


[09/26/2021 6:43 PM] Boldimore#5357
Didn't mine, was thinking about trying on herominers


[09/26/2021 6:44 PM] Boldimore#5357
How was your luck? Did it take long to hit the block?


[09/26/2021 6:46 PM] Kricket#5460
I think my luck was 37% or something - it was definitely low.  The night I pointed the rigs at the solo address, the difficulty dropped down a LOT.  I mined it my first night solo mining.


[09/26/2021 6:48 PM] Kricket#5460
I‚Äôll definitely try the solo route again.  Maybe I‚Äôll give it a week or two and then go back to ETH.

nope, nothing you can do when the difficulty changes, you just get less ergo the higher it is

this is not difficult, but I found out configuration and setting proper diff is hard and i gave up

ME TOO


[09/30/2021 9:07 AM] oblast63#8763
The settings may be complex, but I think I can handle it, they just indicate that I can connect
ErgoStratumProxy, but when installing it, errors occur, and the developer  https://github.com/mhssamadani/ErgoStratumProxy does not want to answer the issue. Then why specify it in the official FAQ?


[09/30/2021 9:33 AM] andee#4722
the proxy is for miners without a stratum client implemented, the open source ones


[09/30/2021 9:34 AM] andee#4722
the best way to get help is not to just say "error occur", include your error and someone might be able to help you


[09/30/2021 9:35 AM] andee#4722
and what guide did you follow?


[09/30/2021 10:04 AM] oblast63#8763
An error occurs when connecting to ErgoStratumProxy. I wanted to ask a question to the developer, but I saw that a question about the exact same error had already been asked and there was no answer to it. https://github.com/mhssamadani/ErgoStratumProxy/issues/22


[09/30/2021 10:05 AM] andee#4722
do you have a stratum server running?


[09/30/2021 10:06 AM] andee#4722
the cmd used in that issue does not even specify the server or port to connect to


[09/30/2021 10:07 AM] andee#4722
could you also link the guide you used for solo mining?


[09/30/2021 10:10 AM] oblast63#8763
This is not my question there, but the errors are lonely. I connect like this to my synchronized node ./ErgoStratumProxy_Linux -s 127.0.0.1 -p 9053 -u test


[09/30/2021 10:14 AM] andee#4722
the node is not running a stratum server


[09/30/2021 10:14 AM] andee#4722
can you link the solo mining guide you followed?


[09/30/2021 10:57 AM] oblast63#8763
I can‚Äôt start ErgoStratumProxy itself in any way. I downloaded it to the same local server where there is a synchronized node and mining is allowed in it. After that, as written here https://github.com/mhssamadani/ErgoStratumProxy I try to run it. But I get errors about which I wrote above. I tried to run and so ./ErgoStratumProxy_Linux -s 127.0.0.1 -p 9053 -u test and so ./ErgoStratumProxy_Linux -s 192.168.3.66 -p 9053 -u test but the errors persist.  ([CONNECTION] Connected to server.

[09/30/2021 10:59 AM] andee#4722
because you need to run a stratum server


[09/30/2021 10:59 AM] andee#4722
its not made for direct connection to the node, its a stratum client for connecting to pools running a stratum server


[09/30/2021 11:01 AM] andee#4722
I keep repeating the same things but you never answer what I am asking you


[09/30/2021 11:04 AM] oblast63#8763
Didn't understand which stratum server? How does it start? Or you need to download it from here https://github.com/mhssamadani/ErgoStratumServer. Are you saying that for solo mining I need a synchronized node + ErgoStratumProxy + ErgoStratumServer? But the solo mining manual doesn't say that. This is what is written in the solo mining guide here https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Mining-Ergo-after-The-Hardening-Upgrade


[09/30/2021 11:05 AM] andee#4722
if you are using the open source miners and will be mining to your node, you connect the miner directly to the node


[09/30/2021 11:05 AM] andee#4722
this guide is for the open source miners, the guide clearly states that the proxy is for pool mining


[09/30/2021 11:07 AM] andee#4722
if you are using any of the closed source miners you have to run a stratum server, no proxy


[09/30/2021 11:07 AM] andee#4722
https://github.com/mhssamadani/ErgoStratumServer


[09/30/2021 11:10 AM] oblast63#8763
I'm sorry, but I use google translator, maybe that's why I don't fully understand you. But I do not understand how to start this stratum server for me. I do everything as it is written in the official manual. I don't use closed source miners, but how then can I change the difficulty of the share so that I can solo mine without a proxy? Can I install ErgoStratumServer to mine as a miner without a pool on my node and reduce the difficulty of the miner's share?


[09/30/2021 11:12 AM] andee#4722
you need the stratum server to change share diff. but why do you even care about share diff if you are solo mining? mine at netdiff


[09/30/2021 11:43 AM] oblast63#8763
I just think that by reducing the complexity of the ball, you can find more solutions and the probability of finding the right solution increases several times. And if you mine with the entire complexity of the network, then there will be much fewer solutions, that is, it will be the same and correct. Why else would the pools reduce the difficulty of the share?


[09/30/2021 11:46 AM] oblast63#8763
Now I installed ErgoStratumServer + ErgoStratumProxy and the miner started working. There you can reduce the complexity of the ball, it remains only to understand if my setup is working correctly. It seems to be writing in the terminal that the balls are valid, but for now I think if this is so before starting to mine. Suddenly, I configured something wrong and the mining time will be wasted. I do not have a lot of capacities, so it will be a pity to waste time


[09/30/2021 11:59 AM] andee#4722
pools reduce the share difficulty so they are able to show you stats about how fast you are hashing and for something like PPLNS, PROP etc, calculate your payment. lower share diff does not give you a higher chance of finding a block


[09/30/2021 12:45 PM] oblast63#8763
Yes, I think so too. But now there are solo pools. You can solo mine there. Then why do they reduce the difficulty of the ball? For what purpose? If the pool is simple, it is clear, there it is necessary to divide the block into all and show who sent how many solutions to the pool to solve the block, but why are they doing solo pools in the same way? It turns out that it does not matter to me how many solutions I send them, the one thing that matters to me is the correct block solution.


[09/30/2021 12:49 PM] andee#4722
for statistics. people want to see their worker as online and what their poolside hashrate is


[09/30/2021 12:49 PM] andee#4722
without smaller diff shares they would have no way of knowing if the worker is online and hashing, no way to estimate hashrate


[10/10/2021 8:34 PM] sgtcasey#2160
Good afternoon everyone.  I'm wondering if anyone has a decent guide on how to solo mine directly from the Ergo node I have synced up and running on my Windows machine using NBMiner.  I've done quite a bit of searching and am coming up blank on how to get NBMiner to connect to the node and begin mining.  Thank you!

you buy a GPU and then you buy a PC for that GPU, so to speak, because the GPU is the most expensive.

You can do solo mining using any port of the pool.
Just use this prefix before the wallet address.
solo:ADDRESS

you will see that its working when you start the batch file and check on herominers website and see your solo effort


[10/28/2021 10:42 PM] Kretenba#9287
I guess 30mh/s isnt likely to find a block in 3 months at least?

[11/18/2021 6:10 PM] Attila#3944
What does this mean?


[11/18/2021 7:13 PM] andee#4722
just a simple question, since 500% effort blocks happens all the time on pools. I think its worth mentioning when people ask if its worth solo mining, even if you will end up earning about the same as pool mining as long as you do it for long enough


[11/18/2021 7:15 PM] Attila#3944
I mean I don‚Äôt know what a 500% block means


[11/18/2021 7:22 PM] andee#4722
aah, 100% effort means that you found a block at the expected time for your hashrate.


[11/18/2021 7:22 PM] Attila#3944
Ah okay, thanks


[11/18/2021 7:23 PM] Attila#3944
So 500% means you take 5x time


[11/18/2021 7:23 PM] andee#4722
so anything under 100% is good, but over time it averages out to +- 100%

Guys, how feasible is it to rent about 800ghs to mine ergo?


[01/21/2022 11:31 AM] blackinsecure#3693
https://www.nicehash.com/pricing

Autolykos

min. price: 0.2995 BTC/TH/day
avg. price: 0.3149 BTC/TH/day


[01/21/2022 11:43 AM] Strider#6512
Thank you. So according to this, it doesn't seem to be profitable at all. I would be running a net loss daily...


[01/21/2022 12:51 PM] blackinsecure#3693
depends on why you're mining


[01/21/2022 12:51 PM] blackinsecure#3693
if you need profitability every single day, yes


[01/21/2022 1:27 PM] Strider#6512
Well I am curious really. There is an entity mining at nearly 1ths which by my reckoning is nearing 10% of the network hashrate and given the renting costs, selling ergo at a net loss which puzzles me.


[01/21/2022 2:27 PM] blackinsecure#3693
more like 6.7%


[01/21/2022 2:27 PM] blackinsecure#3693
are they really selling though? maybe just hodling


[01/21/2022 2:28 PM] Strider#6512
Yeh the wallet is selling high volume.


[01/21/2022 2:28 PM] blackinsecure#3693
weird


[01/21/2022 2:29 PM] Strider#6512
Exactly what I thought... its so strange that it doesn't make sense.


[01/21/2022 2:31 PM] blackinsecure#3693
maybe it's an insider providing liquidity?


[01/21/2022 2:33 PM] Strider#6512
what would that entail, I mean, who counts as an insider and isn't that contrary to the open market principle of ergo?


[01/21/2022 2:34 PM] blackinsecure#3693
idk I'm just speed balling here


[01/21/2022 2:37 PM] LordBeggar#5654
How can Ergo stop people abusing the network with high hashrate?


[01/21/2022 2:37 PM] Strider#6512
You can't stop people from using the network.

This is the person who is abusing the network with high hashrate


[01/21/2022 2:45 PM] LordBeggar#5654
Can we do something about this? He is stealing everyones block


[01/21/2022 2:46 PM] LordBeggar#5654
It's impossible to find a block as long as he is solo mining


[01/21/2022 2:48 PM] Strider#6512
Same guy I was talking about! He runs 800+ghs every day and its odd.


[01/21/2022 3:06 PM] blackinsecure#3693
But do we know this hashrate is rented?


[01/21/2022 3:07 PM] blackinsecure#3693
Maybe a ETH farm already moved some of its HR before ETH 2.0


[01/21/2022 3:07 PM] blackinsecure#3693
then it wouldn't be running on a loss because the hardware would be already paid for


[01/21/2022 6:56 PM] Strider#6512
Its pretty clear to me that it is rented. I am sure there is shady business going on by nicehash but people seem less convinced.


[01/23/2022 8:00 PM] DishBrain#1197
I spent a few hours the other day setting up a node and stratum server. 

I have T-Rex currently mining to it and getting valid shares, at least on the T-Rex console window.

If T-Rex shows valid shares, does that verify that everything is working as intended? or is there a way to verify on the Node, or Server console windows that things are correctly working?


[01/23/2022 8:00 PM] DishBrain#1197
I think I just realized one thing, that I was working with the varDiff, and trying to dial in the difficulty so that I was seeing shares being submitted successfully.  

But I should just be using the standard difficulty port so that it just uses the network difficulty. Then all I would see in the console is when a block is found, I would assume?


[01/23/2022 8:01 PM] DishBrain#1197
I get this when a worker connects though, not sure if it's anything to be concerned about:
```Authorize <walletaddresshere>.worker1:@::ffff:192.168.1.222
debug: [Unknown stratum method from walletaddresshere.worker1 [::ffff:192.168.1.222]: mining.extranonce.subscribe] undefined```


[01/26/2022 11:25 PM] cryptosafe#2323
I wouldnt be suprised if nice hash was using eth to pay out eth miners while using there gpu power to mine ergo or something to stock pile


[01/26/2022 11:50 PM] cryptosafe#2323
I found this to be very confusing


[02/02/2022 9:02 PM] Strider#6512

day 17 of solo mining....with my 700mhs....effort approaching 50%..still no block..looks like my solo venture was a blunder. please god. just one block is all i ask


[03/23/2022 9:25 PM] oocp#3531
Hard to get a solo block right now and your HR is low.  I sniped a dozen at 10GH over a week.  I do see LHR rigs getting blocks, however, the force multiplier is your ping!  Check to see what your delay looks like between the rig and the solo pool.


[03/23/2022 9:44 PM] Salu#0001
wait really!??


[03/23/2022 9:44 PM] Salu#0001
my pings like 120ms


[03/23/2022 9:45 PM] Salu#0001
might just switch pools cause of this and give it another few percent


[03/23/2022 9:49 PM] oocp#3531
120 is not great


[03/23/2022 9:49 PM] Salu#0001
nvm my rig is at 60ms


[03/23/2022 9:49 PM] oocp#3531
2 miners solo and pool are pining from 24 ms


[03/23/2022 9:49 PM] Salu#0001

would hero be a better bet?


[03/23/2022 9:50 PM] oocp#3531
Maybe


[03/23/2022 9:50 PM] oocp#3531
check your ping


[03/23/2022 9:51 PM] Salu#0001
do i just ping the sever in cmd?


[03/23/2022 9:52 PM] oocp#3531
2miners has a US solo pool:  us-solo-erg.2miners.com:9999


[03/23/2022 9:52 PM] oocp#3531
try that


[03/23/2022 9:52 PM] oocp#3531
yes


[03/23/2022 9:52 PM] oocp#3531
use the ping cmd from a cmd line on the server


[03/23/2022 9:52 PM] oocp#3531
if you are using HiveOS - just open a terminal


[03/23/2022 9:53 PM] Salu#0001
im gonna get my other gpus on it and have a total of 1ghz


[03/23/2022 9:53 PM] oocp#3531
that will help


[03/23/2022 9:53 PM] Salu#0001
and try it for a week


[03/23/2022 9:53 PM] Salu#0001
if not then fuck it back to eth i guess


[03/23/2022 9:53 PM] oocp#3531
check the ping


[03/23/2022 9:53 PM] oocp#3531
that delay will kill your chances


[03/23/2022 9:53 PM] Salu#0001
damn it man


[03/23/2022 9:54 PM] Salu#0001
alright what range is acceptable?


[03/23/2022 9:54 PM] oocp#3531
Awesome: 20's. Great: 30's. Everything else:  adding additional variable to winning a block.


[03/23/2022 9:56 PM] oocp#3531
I started on ERG only this month.  I had to figure out the network variables to understand if I could solo mine.  I ultimately mined from a rented rig at a constant rate at the same time from in the region that seemed to have the best ping.


[03/23/2022 9:56 PM] oocp#3531
That said, brute force method:  find a port that is close enough, or setup your own node (like @DishBrainle was saying - I think he left).


[03/23/2022 9:59 PM] Salu#0001
damn setting up my own node would be sick


[03/23/2022 9:59 PM] Salu#0001
but yeah might just rent some hash at this rate


[03/23/2022 9:59 PM] Salu#0001
tried pining hero

alright good was wondering if my understanding was off


[03/23/2022 10:04 PM] oocp#3531
If you can slide in and hold across various regions on the same port, you may win. It works. Sometimes. It fails often. Lol


[03/23/2022 10:04 PM] Salu#0001
man leave me alone and let ya boi hit just one...fucking...block


[03/23/2022 10:04 PM] Salu#0001
ill research into this


[03/23/2022 10:04 PM] Salu#0001
but using diff ports all your doing is sending your shares to different pool addresses


[03/23/2022 10:04 PM] oocp#3531
You should. The whale are aggregating ergo. May be best to get on a pool.


[03/23/2022 10:04 PM] Salu#0001
brute forcing the same amount of shares hoping..that is the solution


[03/23/2022 10:04 PM] oocp#3531
No. Same pool.

any hero stories about single card solo mining and actually getting blocks?


[04/13/2022 9:56 AM] flocki#0712
I found an ergo block with a RX6700xt


[04/13/2022 9:57 AM] flocki#0712
with in a couple of hours, it was less than 1% effort


[04/13/2022 10:05 AM] flocki#0712
i was testing out solo mining on a pool, so it was surprise it popped up so quick, I had to double check it was real.


[04/13/2022 2:32 PM] AvatarOne#8905
just a quick question, does solo mining with 509mh/s make any sense, or should I just stick to a pool?


[04/13/2022 2:32 PM] AvatarOne#8905
thanks in advance!


[04/14/2022 3:28 AM] blackinsecure#3693
unless we're talking about tens of GHs, it's best to stick to pools

[04/15/2022 4:27 AM] coltrain#5970
I dunno I think it's personal preference. It'll be the same over a long enough timeline. My first 3 blocks have been 1%, 1%, 9% so I'm hooked on the solo


[04/15/2022 9:26 PM] RulezZzOr#2883
miner? latency? which pool is best


[04/16/2022 1:23 AM] coltrain#5970
I use newest Trex miner and woolypooly but haven't tried other pools yet, 2.3 ghs


[04/16/2022 9:22 AM] RulezZzOr#2883
wooly seems to be stuck somehow now, 1 block per 24h yes.


[04/16/2022 9:23 AM] RulezZzOr#2883

[04/16/2022 2:01 PM] flocki#0712

[04/16/2022 10:19 PM] bonfiggy#3939
seems rigged no?


[04/16/2022 10:27 PM] flocki#0712
not sure its the pool doing anything wrong, it most likely a latency issue. for me HeroM was the lowest ping @ 100ms


[04/16/2022 10:27 PM] bonfiggy#3939
i get 20ms


[04/16/2022 10:30 PM] flocki#0712
I spun up a local node and strat server, just haven't got a round to moving the rigs to it yet.

What are the benefits to running my node , i set mine up but its for ever synching


[04/28/2022 10:42 AM] lmttx2#3516
in my case it took days to sync, the advantage of node is the speed with which you send the shares +/- 2ms


[04/28/2022 11:47 AM] deadmanjack#7418
Is shares the transactions ?


[04/28/2022 1:07 PM] lmttx2#3516
this ? I'm new to these things, I'm not sure what you  ask.

I think the subpooling that GetBlok are enabling now could make things a lot easier; or would you need at least 1 other person @√Ör√ñhB√™ ?


[05/28/2022 3:06 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
It can be a single solo instance which is what we are in process of launching now.  In the next few weeks user based subpools will be ready which can be customized to mine with friends as youre referring to

Right now I am solo mining to a pool, but I'd like to mine to my own node, are there any references to getting this running? I followed a couple of videos on youtube and appear to have it all running but when I mine to it, the miner doesn't find any shares. and this is what the node says:

hi, i have set up the testnet, and solo  mined some blocks, but with different address, prefix with 'm', like this block
https://testnet.ergoplatform.com/en/blocks/ea3dc3df94ef6b1a14c769d9ef1996c53248912e2f7575452af065d18f29425f
and the node wallet shows my address with prefis '3', with 0 balance.
so what't the relation between these two addresses? how can i use the balance from block coinbase?


[06/09/2022 3:42 AM] zzzkky#1782
now i can see the balance. so i should wait for some confirms to see my balance? how many confirms?

I believe that is High Difficulty. It seems more geared toward miners with high rig count.

Solo Mining for 8 days with 2.4GH and nothing. 94% luck right now. I guess I should have pool mined. I am mining on 2miners.com


[06/29/2022 6:31 PM] Murr#9913
yeah that's not enough GH for solo mining


[06/29/2022 11:17 PM] GeoMax65#0566
The calculator says I should get a block per week and 4 per mo. I kinda want to keep going until I get at least one block and the go back to the pool.


[06/29/2022 11:59 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
Yeah that's the thing with solo mining it's all luck, one month you may only get 2 blocks, another month you could get 6 so over the long run it should even out, but short term is just lucky or unlucky


[06/30/2022 12:00 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
difficulty adjusts also, so it might depend on when you do that calculation


[06/30/2022 12:00 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
it would have to also stay relatively steady


[06/30/2022 12:02 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
and lately the difficulty has been fluctuating a bit


[06/30/2022 1:26 AM] Murr#9913
have you tried using a poisson distribution model to predict when you might get a block?


[06/30/2022 2:19 AM] GeoMax65#0566
No I have not. I pulled one rig off and went back to the pool. I will just let it go solo on the others for a few more days. If I dont get a block, oh well. I only missed out on a block at this point.


[06/30/2022 2:20 AM] GeoMax65#0566
Yes. It is wilding jumping around. Not sure what is behind that?


[06/30/2022 2:22 AM] GeoMax65#0566
Even though mining ETH kinda dried up, I think I would keep mining ERGO for the long haul. It seems more solid than anything else I have mined. Rigs are stable and cool. Power drain is much less. What's not to like, right?


[06/30/2022 5:25 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
profitability switching I would guess, would think once ergo has more hashrate it would stabalize more


[06/30/2022 5:26 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
I mined raven a little bit and yeah the cards ran a lot hotter, it's nice for the summer with them much cooler


[06/30/2022 7:51 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
do you have mining = true set in ergo.conf?

You can change it afterwards, you will just need to shut down and restart the node after changing the .conf file


[06/30/2022 11:45 PM] Murr#9913
I'm starting up a new node right now in docker ubuntu raspberry pi 4


[06/30/2022 11:55 PM] GeoMax65#0566
I gave up on solo-mining. Just not worth fighting all the manipulation and greed. I will just chip away making my little pool profit and hope someday that ERGO goes to the moon.


[07/01/2022 12:01 AM] Murr#9913
put the local ip address of the node and port 3032


[07/01/2022 12:05 AM] Murr#9913
if you are trying to connect to your node from outside your local network you will need to use the public ip address to connect


[07/01/2022 12:28 AM] Murr#9913
for your rigs on the home network, you would put the node's local ip address, not 127.0.0.1, that would only work if you were mining on the same machine as the node


[07/01/2022 12:29 AM] Murr#9913
yes for your friends to connect give them your ISP public ip address


[07/01/2022 12:36 AM] Murr#9913
No that‚Äôs the public IP address get the node private IP address that your router assigned the node pc, usually begins with 192. Or 10.


[07/01/2022 12:45 AM] Murr#9913
Yes


[07/01/2022 12:46 AM] Murr#9913

Hello sorry for the trouble but I have a problem.  So I was able to configure the whole node and also the wallet then after I launched ErgoStratumServer and thank god it started without any errors.  Now I have a problem with hive.os.  In practice I put the ip of the pc where I installed the node example 192.168.50.76:3032 and the wallet and the rest but the conditions from shellinabox I see them doing them but the gpu does not start on hiveos!  What cost am I doing wrong in the flight sheet configuration?
on the powershell of ErgoStratumServer see what is written in the images I have attached to you

Try to just put the ip and port without stratum+tcp


[07/02/2022 12:50 AM] Murr#9913
In the flight sheet


[07/02/2022 12:53 AM] claudiodelf#7503
Already tried but if I don't put it it doesn't even share 1! the problem is that the gpus don't start


[07/02/2022 12:53 AM] Murr#9913
Try a different miner


[07/02/2022 12:53 AM] Murr#9913
Trex or gminer


[07/02/2022 12:54 AM] Murr#9913
For 5700xt I would use phoenix miner or team red miner


[07/02/2022 12:54 AM] claudiodelf#7503
I call these mysteries !!!! Finally I managed to synchronize all the node and the server and now the hive does not start .... Crazy


[07/02/2022 12:55 AM] Murr#9913
I don‚Äôt use hiveos anymore


[07/02/2022 12:55 AM] claudiodelf#7503
now I try


[07/02/2022 1:52 AM] claudiodelf#7503
Then with t-rex and lolminer the gpu start but with port 3032 the gpu does not go to maximum speed instead with port 3256 it is fine to the maximum .... It seems to me that I finally managed to set everything with this rig.

sure it does a lot of refused shares but it makes a mess of it with the low ping with the local node


[07/02/2022 2:53 AM] Murr#9913
oh yeah you can change the ports and difficulty to whatever you want on the stratum server


[07/02/2022 3:08 AM] claudiodelf#7503
In fact the difficulty in port 3032 was starting from 8 which was too low and I set it to 256 now and I took port 3256 off the flight sheet.  Now it starts from at least 256 and adjusts the difficulty directly from port 3032.Thank you again for your help, if it wasn't for you I was still going crazy ... Thanks a lot friend.


[07/02/2022 3:09 AM] Murr#9913

Hello and good morning can you help me with this configuration of the start.js txt for the configuration of the difficulty. What settings did you set as the minimum difficulty of port 3032?
I'll put some pictures under you. I would like to try to fix this problem I have with port 3032 ... if I put port 3256 the difficulty is always static at 256!
Can you help me about it?

[07/02/2022 1:28 PM] claudiodelf#7503
I think it is optimal to set a sharing difficulty of 8 or 9 Gb inside the start.js file
Consider that initially on this node I will put about 6.5 GB of power on Ergo so I think a right difficulty to set should be 8 or 9 GB.
How did you set everything up in yours?
I found this setting online on youtube that I put below in the image, in your opinion this is a good setting here.

[07/02/2022 1:32 PM] claudiodelf#7503
But you with more than 8 gb of power in ergo alone on the node, how many blocks can you extract in an average month more or less?


[07/02/2022 4:53 PM] Murr#9913
That looks like the same setting I used from the YouTube video

The others I have on eth in pool ... I wanted to try ergo just to see if it was better. But if I don't take another block by July 5th at 6pm, I'm below the eth pool. I thought much better erg in solo sincerely. Then yesterday 2miner sucked just 34 blocks in just 24 hours

For Miningcore, I'm looking for suggestions for my config.json file. I have an ERGO node setup and just want to mine to my node. I just want the rewards to go to the node wallet. What should I put in the config.json file for that... Also if I am mining to my own node, should I use varidiff? Or should I just set a static difficulty? Would it be more likely to hit a block with a low static diff like 1.0 if I'm not worrying about network congestion?

Any help would be appreciated üôÇ


[07/07/2022 11:27 PM] Elemental#9509
Yoo random but genuine question since I'm curious and this seems like the most logical place to ask. If I were to look for a friend/partner to solo mine with, would anyone be interested? ü§î Currently at 4.6gh for those who care haha
Profits would be split accordingly of course


[07/07/2022 11:42 PM] Babelfish24#2887
I've done this before, but we had similar hashrates.


[07/07/2022 11:43 PM] Babelfish24#2887
honestly, just solomine to a pool.


[07/07/2022 11:43 PM] Babelfish24#2887
or a node


[07/07/2022 11:44 PM] Babelfish24#2887
If you are going to split it in accordance with hash power you are just pool mining with a more sporadic payout....


[07/08/2022 12:48 AM] Murr#9913
I was going to do that with a friend but when the ETH diff bomb got reset they bailed out


[07/08/2022 12:56 AM] Elemental#9509

Yo @Murr how much hash do you have again? on ergo


[07/08/2022 5:22 AM] Murr#9913
8-9gh


[07/08/2022 12:35 PM] Elemental#9509
Oh dang. Got a better estimate by chance? lol


[07/08/2022 9:53 PM] Murr#9913
Estimate of what ?


[07/08/2022 11:10 PM] Elemental#9509
The hashrate. You said 8-9gh and that's kinda a big gap in between so I'm curious to know what the official amount is. Lol


[07/08/2022 11:10 PM] Elemental#9509
Like 8.5gh or something


[07/08/2022 11:16 PM] Murr#9913
It goes up and down between 8-9 on ergo, your hashrate stays steady?


[07/08/2022 11:38 PM] Elemental#9509
I meant like on hiveos or whatever you use. What is the displayed average amount? Lol
Mine stays steady around 4.6gh


[07/09/2022 12:33 PM] GeoMax65#0566
This had me thinking about strategy. If one isnt selling, would it make more sense to mine and hold ERG rather than ETH? Mine 1000 ERG and hold, or mine 1 ETH and hold?


[07/09/2022 12:34 PM] GeoMax65#0566
Current price is not a real indicator of future value. Future value target is what makes me think having more coin at a lower entry point has greater potential upside.


[07/09/2022 11:21 PM] Elemental#9509
Personally I think that ergo is the way since eth mining is coming to an end and ergo still has tons of potential and more room to grow


[07/09/2022 11:36 PM] Elemental#9509
Also yeah I'm just gonna go for it now. Anyone looking for a friend/partner to solo mine with together to increase our chances of finding blocks? Lol

I got 4.6gh on the ready with soon to be more

NVMiner is free, but not as good

Am I right thinking that Solo is not the way to go if I have 53mh/s?
Not sure if it's enough to mine with or not.


[07/31/2022 4:18 PM] blackinsecure#3693
yes you are


[07/31/2022 4:19 PM] blackinsecure#3693
to be worth it, solo mining only above a couple of GHs


[07/31/2022 4:20 PM] blahBloodyBlah#6434
Wow, that was a fast reply. Here I was expecting 24 hours. Nope. 
Ok, yup. I'll try out a pool and see how that goes.

Guys, an information ... I don't understand why every time I close the ergo and stratum pool node and then I reopen it every time I have to do the configuration from Swagger UI 127.0.0.1:9053/swagger#/utils/hashBlake2b
/ utils / hash / blake2b ?????? And of course also the authorization from ApiKeyAuth (apiKey)?
It's normal ? or did I do something wrong in the configuration phase? Please help me. Thank you

Hi, I am just getting in to mining and building a rig for the very first time. I have been reading the handbook and watching videos, and learning a lot. However, it is a lot of stuff to take in and before I begin accumulating my parts, is there a list of major considerations to check when building a mining rig for Ergo? 
For example, if I have more than one GPU, should they all be the same make, i.e. Nvidia or AMD? Or minimum specs on CPU, CPU RAM, overclock? Total noob here, and just learning.

I have a fully functioning node, I would like to generate another wallet address for this node, but I don't see in the swagger API the ability to create another address.  I see you can init a new wallet.  Is that what I have to do?  I would think that one wallet could have multiple addresses.

Currently trying to setup my node for solo mining. Node is fully synced and I'm using miningcore currently to set up the stratum, but it won't take the last bit of my config file. 
            => 'Payment Processing' must not be empty.
This is the error

Good afternoon I would like to have a clarification on the ergo node. I'm running a custom node but getting debugged on ErgoStratumServer
debug: [Block notification via RPC polling] undefined
Is this normal or is there some problem in the node?
Another question: Is there a way from the personal node to know if a block has been taken via notification from android mobile or something similar? I await clarification in this regard thanks.

[09/28/2022 3:15 AM] MaMa#7975
how did u pass


[09/28/2022 3:15 AM] Babelfish24#2887
Are you having the same issue?


[09/28/2022 3:16 AM] Babelfish24#2887
Try this command:
git config --global url.https://github.com/.insteadOf git://github.com/


[09/28/2022 3:22 AM] MaMa#7975
thank you, will try


[09/28/2022 3:24 AM] Babelfish24#2887
no problem


[09/28/2022 4:22 AM] Babelfish24#2887
Did that work for you?


[09/28/2022 4:30 AM] MaMa#7975
yes it work, not syncing thank you

[09/28/2022 4:38 AM] Babelfish24#2887
actually, Mhs_Sam and vorujack fixed it, There was a mistake in the varDiff.js file.

could u share?

Just checked my payments from nanopool. Usually i get 1 ergo per day. Now last payment 14th September. What's up? My miners have been running all the time. Anything i should adjuts?


[10/03/2022 5:00 AM] DishBrain#1197
Question about setting the difficulty in the ErgoStratumServer config.  My goal is to solo mine to my own node. With the node running on a server and my rigs pointing at it as if it were a pool. I've set up my node and synced it, and set up ErgoStratumServer.  I'm able to connect to it from my rig and I can see the valid shares being submitted and the variable difficulty adjusting.

But, if I'm solo mining, and the only one mining, would I not need to set the difficulty to the same as the network difficulty? Or can a valid share of any difficulty actually find a block, regardless of what the network difficulty is?

I have the same question...


[10/15/2022 4:59 PM] KC-Cowboy#6297
LMK if I am wrong here, but difficulty has more to do with network traffic than 'finding a block'.  ie. Higher difficulty = lower network traffic


[10/15/2022 5:01 PM] KC-Cowboy#6297
Variable difficulty usually tries to adjust to get about 4 shares/min ...


[10/15/2022 8:38 PM] Lopes#3669
hi all , 3 weeks here in solo mining with my 6 card rig , 0 blocks founds , luck around 35/50% ,its normal ?


[10/15/2022 9:58 PM] Jack#3324
@Lopes yes, for compare pool vs solo 100% luck is like mining via pool. If you bellow then you lucky and outperform mining pool BUT if your effort is more then 100% then you are in worse position as mining via pool. There are even 400% efforts or more to hit a single block. You are basically gambling by solo mining.

[12/09/2022 12:28 AM] Redrum Master#9143
With current diff is 4gh enough for solo?

i wouldnt. itll take you like over a week to find blocks on avrg.

Is anyone solo mining on full local ergo node? I want to know whether its wise idea or not?

[12/21/2022 9:17 PM] matty_19#4994
If anyone can provide some direction that would be awesome. I had a look at Ergo Doc Solo Mining page and I'm still not sure whats happening. Block reward looks like it's paid to my reward address. Shows up as a balance on my node wallet, but not on Explorer or my mobile app that should be linked. Confirmations on the transaction look like they are at 1160 but still doesn't seem accessible. Maybe i have something configured incorrectly? üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[12/21/2022 9:49 PM] matty_19#4994
When I scan unspent boxes it shows spending transaction:null


[12/22/2022 2:46 AM] HastyBear#6742
@matty_19  Would you be kind to assist me setup solo mining in local ergo node in windows?
Below steps are done following the online vidos:
installed Node.js
installed open SSL
installed bignum node package
installed ergo node which is fully synced now.
mining = true in conf file.


[12/22/2022 2:50 AM] matty_19#4994
i don't think im the best person lol. Currently trying to figure out why i have rewards but they don't show up in other wallets.


[12/22/2022 2:55 AM] HastyBear#6742
Thats okay. You at least managed to set it up and successfully hit a block too ... correct? If you can take out some time to walk me through the steps you have performed so far will be a great help.


[12/22/2022 2:56 AM] matty_19#4994
Yeah i believe so. Funds are in the reward address but didn't land on my actual wallet. Seem to be stranded.


[12/22/2022 3:00 AM] matty_19#4994
https://youtu.be/_1M8dGpfKjU that guy has 3 videos that were pretty comprehensive. 1 is the node setup 2 is the stratum server. 3 is mining to it i believe. I don't speak german but was able to follow along with the video. Let me know if you get hung up somewhere along the way


[12/22/2022 3:01 AM] matty_19#4994
Some of the items are slightly older so just make sure you use the correct version number in your conf file

Okay let me follow it... Thanks


[12/22/2022 3:03 AM] HastyBear#6742
for your first block what was the time taken and how much hash rate you have?

what pool difficulty are you setting may I ask?


[12/23/2022 1:56 AM] matty_19#4994
Variable I believe. Was already set up in the stratum server files.


[12/23/2022 1:57 AM] deathgripson#2395
Ok so just the default 4000000


[12/23/2022 1:57 AM] deathgripson#2395
what was the issue with the unspent box


[12/23/2022 1:58 AM] matty_19#4994
Variable depending on your hashrate. Had my config file set up incorrectly. Then I reset wallet and sent myself a transfer. Everything popped back up after.

[12/23/2022 2:00 AM] deathgripson#2395
I was just experimenting setting it lower to increase the base difficulty


[12/23/2022 2:02 AM] matty_19#4994
if i recall correctly shares don't affect actual mining performance. They are an indicator for the pool to tell hashrate performance unless i'm mistaken. Would probably cause issues with too many shares maybe because they would cause a lot of overhead but don't really affect finding blocks


[12/23/2022 2:02 AM] matty_19#4994
Share Difficulty and Mining Difficulty

Share and block solution are different things.
Share difficulty doesn‚Äôt affect the number of blocks found by a pool.
Share difficulty doesn‚Äôt affect miner rewards.
Shares are used by miners to monitor their rigs and by pools to distribute rewards amongst their miners.


[12/23/2022 2:02 AM] matty_19#4994
thats from the 2 miners page


[12/23/2022 2:03 AM] matty_19#4994
for solo mining anyways.


[12/23/2022 2:04 AM] deathgripson#2395
This makes sense but since im a small solo mine I should probably not set high difficulty or else the share reporting may be to slow to submit on time, does that make sense?


[12/23/2022 2:04 AM] matty_19#4994
Unless I'm mistaken block solutions and shares are 2 different things


[12/23/2022 2:05 AM] deathgripson#2395
Would be nice to get an expert to clarify this lol


[12/23/2022 2:05 AM] deathgripson#2395
but thank you for your info


[12/23/2022 2:06 AM] matty_19#4994
It has absolutely nothing to do with your probability of finding a block. It only changes how accurate the pool's idea of your hashrate (and thus affects your share of payout in case it finds something) is. ‚Äì

Cool, well then yeah what peter said lol


[12/23/2022 2:08 AM] deathgripson#2395
in this case maybe difficulty can be turned up without worrying, I guess it doesnt matter though If i am not paying per share


[12/23/2022 2:09 AM] matty_19#4994
Seems like it will just affect your hashrate reporting


[12/23/2022 8:42 AM] claudiodelf#7503
Sorry guys, a question: But if I would like to set the starting difficulty of the share to 35 GB in start.js, what value should I change???


[12/23/2022 8:46 AM] claudiodelf#7503
Because I have the same settings as yours but I have too many low shares even under 1 gb and this is not good. I would like to find a setting to have shares starting from at least 18 GB and going up. But I did several tests but without any change


[12/23/2022 9:50 AM] HastyBear#6742
Something went wrong with my node so deleted .ergo folder and resyncing node. Its keep on failing after couple of hours before node can fully sync. Now I have installed WSL and syncing node in ubuntu environment. its in progress...

Glad that its working for you . I'll contact you if I will get stuck.

yeah not really profitable at this price point but gonna mine and hold for a bit. I already had all the equipment sitting from eth mining. Hope for the best lol. If i sold as i mined it would be close ish to break even but it's also -40 here so maybe help offset some heating costs lol.


[12/23/2022 3:40 PM] matty_19#4994
is it just coming up all the time or once in awhile?


[12/23/2022 3:43 PM] matty_19#4994
Just for reference my one 3090 ti sits around 4G and i almost never see a low diff share error


[12/25/2022 10:56 AM] claudiodelf#7503
If you have 4 GB of power on Ergo, the calculation to do to set the difficulty is as follows:

The power of the current network is from 28.66 TH to 35.34 TH so the calculation is 29 th divided your power 4 GB x 8 which are and shares to take 1 block result: 58 add three zeros after the number or the comma and you can enter that both minimum and maximum difficulty

I set here what you should insert with 4 gb of power:


"ports": {
         "3032": { //A port for your miners to connect to
             "diff": 58000,//the pool difficulty for this port
             /*
             * use this parameter to multiply difficulty to b for each request.
             * some miner like NBMiner does not support difficulty method of stratum.
             * if you want your pool work with these miners set this parameters.
             *
             * */
             "multiplyDifficulty": true,
             /* Variable difficulty is a feature that will automatically adjust difficulty for
                individual miners based on their hashrate in order to lower networking overhead */
             "varDiff": {
                 "minDiff": 58000,//Minimum difficulty
                 "maxDiff": 58000,//Network difficulty will be used if it is lower than this
                 "targetTime": 15, //Try to get 1 share per this many seconds
                 "retargetTime": 10, //Check to see if we should retarget every this many seconds
                 "variancePercent": 30, //Allow time to very this % from target without retargeting
             }
         },
         "3256": { //Another port for your miners to connect to, this port does not use varDiff
             "diff": 58000,//The pool difficulty

If example the rig has 1gb of power it hardly changes from 58000 to 232000.
I hope you understand the alcohol you need to make.

[12/25/2022 2:43 PM] matty_19#4994
I think we might be mixing up terms here lol. That card mines at 255 - 260 MH/s and with the variable difficulty that is already set up it sits at a share difficulty of just under 4G as reported by T rex miner. There's no need to set a hard value. Also share difficulty doesn't matter a whole bunch in solo mining, it doesnt affect your block find chance. It only changes your accuracy of hashrate reporting and is used by a 3rd party pool to calculate reward payout.


[12/25/2022 9:34 PM] matty_19#4994
At the bottom of your pic it also says the diff number doesn't matter if you are using variable difficulty as it will adjust itselft

https://docs.ergoplatform.com/

There's some resources there. Under miners there's a solo mining and start a pool section. Let me know if you get stuck and I can try and help though I'm not super well versed. Seems to be working on my setup but I've been having some issues with needing to transfer to myself to get the funds to show up in my actual wallet instead of sitting in the rewards wallet. Made some adjustments to my config file and just got another block though. We'll see if it will all work automatically this time. I have a node set up and use the stratum server that's all linked on that page.


[01/04/2023 7:55 PM] matty_19#4994
Same as above lol. I use windows not Linux though and I'm not using miningcore but I can try to help after work if you're still stuck.

( maybe i am not sure ) , the command CREATE TABLE shares_mypool1 PARTITION OF shares FOR VALUES IN ('mypool1');  , always give me error , that  "ERROR : "shares" is not partitioned "  ,  so in config.json ,  in config.json under pool section , there is a details i have to add , like pool name etc ...  i am not sure "pools": [
        // Repeat the following section for multiple coins
        {
            // DON'T change the id after a production pool has begun collecting shares!

also i am confused , in this part daemon "daemons": [

                    "host": "192.168.101.81",

                    "password": "",
                    "apiKey": "", << i have to add the long key or only the word used to generate the apikey  "hello "  , also which user and password ?  dont know....


[01/04/2023 8:04 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
god


[01/04/2023 8:06 PM] matty_19#4994
Are you mining to your local machine this is running on?


[01/04/2023 8:07 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
no , i just purchased another computer to be dedicated only for Ergo node setup , it is ubuntu  desktop version i am using .


[01/04/2023 8:07 PM] matty_19#4994
Sorry is your stratum on the same machine as the node? Because then the host should be 127.0.0.1 if I'm not mistaken


[01/04/2023 8:07 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
yes


[01/04/2023 8:07 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
you are right


[01/04/2023 8:08 PM] matty_19#4994
So host on your stratum should be pointed at 127.0.0.1 then you point the miners at the ip of the machine your node is on.


[01/04/2023 8:08 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
default is 127.0.0.1 , same as 192.168.101.81 , where i am running the node


[01/04/2023 8:09 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
both are ergo node computer


[01/04/2023 8:10 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
@matty_19 possible to DM you ?


[01/04/2023 8:11 PM] matty_19#4994
Sure. I'm just not at either of my node computers to check setup until after work


[01/04/2023 8:11 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
i am fully understand , just i would send you some screenshots ... so might once you finish you work , can help


[01/04/2023 8:13 PM] matty_19#4994
Might be easier if you use the stratum server option  instead of miningcore because I vaguely know what I'm looking at there lol. No idea what minincore setup should be lol.


[01/04/2023 8:14 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
ErgoStratumServer ?


[01/04/2023 8:15 PM] matty_19#4994
Yeah i think that's the one


[01/04/2023 8:15 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
starting from the scratch  üò¶


[01/04/2023 8:19 PM] matty_19#4994
Just should have to put your address on above the recipients section, delete other recipients and change host to 127.0.0.1 3/4 of the way down the page.


[01/04/2023 8:20 PM] matty_19#4994
Unless I'm forgetting a step.


[01/04/2023 8:20 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
sorry i am lost where exactly ?


[01/04/2023 8:21 PM] matty_19#4994
In the start.json file of ergo stratum server


[01/04/2023 8:23 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
start.js ?


[01/04/2023 8:26 PM] matty_19#4994
It's the config file for ergo stratum server.


[01/04/2023 8:27 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
got it matty_19 , i will strat now with stratum server


[01/04/2023 8:53 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
getting error can not find bignum  , i do npm install bignum , but seem doing nothing


[01/04/2023 10:03 PM] deathgripson#2395
what hardware are you running the stratum on


[01/04/2023 10:03 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
ubuntu , i beleive now the stratum is working ,


[01/04/2023 10:03 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
but still not able to connect


[01/04/2023 10:04 PM] deathgripson#2395
oh cool, i mean like architecture. i tried on raspi and couldnt install bignum so i put the stratum on my amd node and kept the ergo node on my raspi. Are you connecting from the same network or a different internet network?


[01/04/2023 10:05 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
@matty_19  can you check your DM please


[01/04/2023 10:06 PM] matty_19#4994
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0G7IMMVlMIM

I followed that video it's for windows though so the issues he found along the way and fixed are probably a bit different on Linux but it helped me to follow along on windows.


[01/04/2023 10:06 PM] deathgripson#2395
if connecting from a different network use your public IP and open/port-forward the port you need to connect to


[01/04/2023 10:07 PM] matty_19#4994
Looks like from your screenshot it should be working. Once you point a miner at the stratum server it should start sending your miner jobs


[01/04/2023 10:07 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
port 9053 ?


[01/04/2023 10:08 PM] matty_19#4994
Shouldn't need to forward if you're on your own local network


[01/04/2023 10:08 PM] deathgripson#2395
I know i was saying if you are on a different network


[01/04/2023 10:08 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
i am on same network


[01/04/2023 10:09 PM] deathgripson#2395
connect to your personal ip that is running the stratum, you can find that ip via command ``ip add`` on ubuntu


[01/04/2023 10:10 PM] deathgripson#2395
the port is specified in the start.js file, the variable difficulty one


[01/04/2023 10:14 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
is there any use for the user and password ?


[01/04/2023 10:14 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
into daemon section


[01/04/2023 10:15 PM] deathgripson#2395
i dont think so, not sure how those work. I left them blank and havent had to deal with them


[01/04/2023 10:15 PM] matty_19#4994
On my t rex for example it's stratum+tcp://192.168.1.119:3032. I'm pretty sure 3032 is the default port for variable difficulty I believe.


[01/04/2023 10:15 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
ohhh


[01/04/2023 10:15 PM] deathgripson#2395
yea 3032 is the mining server


[01/04/2023 10:15 PM] deathgripson#2395
the node default was 9053


[01/04/2023 10:15 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
into my flight sheet , i have to add the word stratum+tcp ?


[01/04/2023 10:15 PM] matty_19#4994
Username and password isn't used


[01/04/2023 10:16 PM] deathgripson#2395
yes


[01/04/2023 10:16 PM] deathgripson#2395
for most mining software i think


[01/04/2023 10:16 PM] matty_19#4994
That's my bat file for windows not sure about linux


[01/04/2023 10:16 PM] deathgripson#2395
teamredminer doesnt need the stratum+tcp


[01/04/2023 10:17 PM] deathgripson#2395
looks like Server field needs stratum+tcp while URL field does not in hiveOS flightsheets


[01/04/2023 10:17 PM] matty_19#4994
Same format you would use for a pool just instead of pointing at the pool website it's going to your local network ip of your mining server.


[01/04/2023 10:21 PM] deathgripson#2395
make sure you changed the address where block rewards are given as well as removing reward recipients


[01/04/2023 10:22 PM] deathgripson#2395
line 23 & 29


[01/04/2023 10:23 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
ok let me try that


[01/04/2023 10:26 PM] matty_19#4994
Yeah that step is critical lol.


[01/04/2023 10:32 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
i beleive  then it is my network issue


[01/04/2023 10:34 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
my rig ip : 192.168.100.2  , node ip : 192.168.101.81  , i can ping  node ip from my rig  , does this mean no network issue  ?


[01/04/2023 10:35 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
it shouldnt be an issue


[01/04/2023 10:49 PM] deathgripson#2395
yea you should be able to connect to 192.168.101.81:3032 from your mining rig


[01/04/2023 10:49 PM] deathgripson#2395
or stratum+tcp://192.168.101.81:3032


[01/04/2023 10:54 PM] deathgripson#2395
I have a mesh network which allows me to connect from wifi, if you are using something like that your wifi could produce a different IP than your ethernet connection, if ``ip add`` produces two inet addr results you could disconnect the wired connection and run ip add on the wifi to get your wifi IP. If you are only using wired connection though then the previous thing should work. If this is the case you can get around all of it by port forwarding and connecting to public IP


[01/05/2023 12:17 AM] matty_19#4994
You have a different subnet. One is on 101 one is on 100. Should be on the same subnet. Might be your issue.

{Reactions}
this 

[01/05/2023 2:32 AM] matty_19#4994
Oh also make sure you unlock your wallet once your node is running. Not entirely sure how critical that is but it's in all the tutorials I saw so I have a batch file to start everything and unlock my wallet after the node is running.


[01/08/2023 6:45 PM] deathgripson#2395
Opinions on if raspi 4 8gb Ergo node would be a disadvantage to use as a solo mining pool?


[01/12/2023 1:27 AM] deathgripson#2395
Does anyone know how one could change transaction fees if hosting solo mining node w ergostratumserver


[01/12/2023 1:27 AM] deathgripson#2395
is it in the config of the nodes?


[01/12/2023 7:11 PM] glasgowm#9381
@Sachin$17 some resources/discussions in this channel. Also there's a start.js here for stratum

https://docs.ergoplatform.com/mining/setup/stratum/#startjs


[01/12/2023 7:13 PM] Sachin$17#1581
Yes I have start.js


[01/12/2023 7:14 PM] Sachin$17#1581
I have change ip address to localhost and user password accordingly


[01/12/2023 9:29 PM] deathgripson#2395
user and password doesnt need to be used if solo as far as im aware


[01/12/2023 9:53 PM] deathgripson#2395
anyone have a good idea on re-targeting time settings? Would faster re-targeting be beneficial?


[01/13/2023 2:00 AM] Sachin$17#1581
@deathgripson I think user and password is just words... Weather I use default or I use something else.as far as ergo node concern

Am I doing right or something wrong? Please help me


[01/13/2023 5:59 AM] deathgripson#2395
is mining enabled in your ergo.conf


[01/13/2023 6:12 AM] Sachin$17#1581
@deathgripson yes it's enabled


[01/13/2023 6:13 AM] deathgripson#2395
checkReemissionRules = true
also?


[01/13/2023 6:13 AM] Sachin$17#1581
@deathgripson yes it's also true


[01/13/2023 6:13 AM] deathgripson#2395
how long has the node been running


[01/13/2023 6:14 AM] Sachin$17#1581
One and half hour


[01/13/2023 6:14 AM] Sachin$17#1581
But it's fully synced


[01/13/2023 6:15 AM] deathgripson#2395
try removing user and password settings in the start.js and rerunning it if youre using those


[01/13/2023 6:16 AM] Sachin$17#1581
@deathgripson you mean the user by default start.js gave me... I should remove it and run without user and password?


[01/13/2023 6:17 AM] deathgripson#2395
in the daemons section of start.js looks like this:
```"daemons": [
        {   //Main daemon instance
            "host": "NODE IP ADDRESS",
            "port": 9053,
            "user": "",
            "password": ""
        }
    ],```


[01/13/2023 6:18 AM] Sachin$17#1581
@deathgripson yes done it


[01/13/2023 6:18 AM] deathgripson#2395
let me know if it runs normally


[01/13/2023 6:18 AM] Sachin$17#1581

[01/13/2023 6:20 AM] Sachin$17#1581
Do I need to restart node also after changing in start.js?

[01/13/2023 6:25 AM] Sachin$17#1581
It shows like this


[01/13/2023 6:27 AM] deathgripson#2395
are you planning to solo mine with only one gpu or more? it looks like this is due to the variable difficulty setting likely


[01/13/2023 6:27 AM] Sachin$17#1581
Pool difficulty is set to 35G and my hashrate is approx 30


[01/13/2023 6:27 AM] Sachin$17#1581
@deathgripson yes I am planning solo.. But single gpu is just for testing purpose


[01/13/2023 6:27 AM] Sachin$17#1581
I have rig also


[01/13/2023 6:28 AM] deathgripson#2395
when you add more gpu from your rig it should theoretically start to solve the shares faster


[01/13/2023 6:28 AM] deathgripson#2395
or you can turn down the targeting settings : ```"varDiff": {
                "minDiff": 8, //Minimum difficulty
                "maxDiff": 16431986528747520, //Network difficulty will be used if it is lower than this
                "targetTime": 15, //Try to get 1 share per this many seconds
                "retargetTime": 10, //Check to see if we should retarget every this many seconds
                "variancePercent": 30 //Allow time to very this % from target without retargeting
            }```


[01/13/2023 6:29 AM] Sachin$17#1581
@deathgripson OK... But I think I can set a lower difficulty so that it can give me few share just to test... Then I can connect my rig... Will that work?


[01/13/2023 6:29 AM] deathgripson#2395
go ahead and try


[01/13/2023 6:29 AM] deathgripson#2395
not an expert on this yet unfortunately


[01/13/2023 6:30 AM] Sachin$17#1581
How much I can set according to my single gpu


[01/13/2023 6:31 AM] deathgripson#2395
tough to say, in general all i know that works is turning target time and retarget time down


[01/13/2023 6:31 AM] deathgripson#2395
they will adjust the difficulty automatically


[01/13/2023 6:31 AM] deathgripson#2395
when you turn the time down it will adjust faster and ask for shares faster


[01/13/2023 6:32 AM] deathgripson#2395
may cause invalid shares if too fast


[01/13/2023 6:32 AM] Sachin$17#1581
Which time should down... Target time or retarget time?


[01/13/2023 6:32 AM] deathgripson#2395
start with target time change it to 10 maybe


[01/13/2023 6:33 AM] deathgripson#2395
is it posting that weird large error output on your stratum server still? that happens to mine during normal function but not consistently its very random


[01/13/2023 6:35 AM] Sachin$17#1581
Ok


[01/13/2023 8:24 AM] Sachin$17#1581
Now it has started giving me errors... Connection failed


[01/13/2023 1:01 PM] Sachin$17#1581
Working good now.... It's just we need to adjust difficulty according to our hardware.. Then you are good to go..


[01/13/2023 3:22 PM] matty_19#4994
shares are just a measure of mining speed. they target 15 and adjust diff automatically to try and only get 4 shares per minute so you aren't hammering out a whole bunch for nothing.


[01/13/2023 3:23 PM] matty_19#4994
roughly targeting 15 seconds per share


[01/13/2023 3:23 PM] matty_19#4994
share difficulty doesn't affect mining performance just more shares gives you a more accurate hashrate measurement but causes more overhead.


[01/13/2023 3:24 PM] matty_19#4994
from the pic in the support channel you need to rescan your wallet.


[01/13/2023 3:41 PM] matty_19#4994
Also in the first pic you sent it looks like you have your wallet address in the reward recipients section. In the readme notes for Ergo Stratum Server it says that isn't used. Your address goes above that section "address": "YourAddress", and remove the rest of them under reward recipients. User name and password is also not used.


[01/13/2023 4:19 PM] Sachin$17#1581
@matty_19 how to rescan wallet?

You'll need to load it locally on your swagger or run it via CLI


[01/13/2023 4:22 PM] glasgowm#9381
```
curl -X POST "http://204.48.31.129:9053/wallet/rescan" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "api_key: hello" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"fromHeight\":0}"
```

@glasgowm OK.. I got it... I saw that curl command... I need to run that command locally

@glasgowm thank you I will try it


[01/13/2023 4:28 PM] deathgripson#2395
Im using the default target time and difficulty but still getting share not found pretty consistently should I turn my settings up maybe?


[01/13/2023 4:30 PM] matty_19#4994
swagger will actually run commands too. Login at the top input API key and click try it out and execute


[01/13/2023 4:33 PM] matty_19#4994
it adjusts to find a share in the target time automatically. Shouldn't have to its more likely OC settings or network inconsistency/speed if you are getting a lot of invalid shares


[01/13/2023 4:33 PM] matty_19#4994
like your local network of miners connecting to the node


[01/13/2023 4:34 PM] matty_19#4994
I get some every once in awhile but fairly rare.


[01/13/2023 4:35 PM] matty_19#4994
My node is also hard wire connected the other mining rigs are over wifi for the most part. Noticed more errors when i tested with one of the wifi rigs hosting the node.


[01/13/2023 4:35 PM] deathgripson#2395
Yea, I basically have been experimenting with tweaking those settings which was what lead to the share not found, but even after I turned it back to default settings still getting some. not nearly as much but maybe my rigs are adjusting to the pool difficulty or something


[01/13/2023 4:36 PM] matty_19#4994
like within a couple min of them running they should be at a roughly consistent share time of 15s per share submitted


[01/13/2023 4:37 PM] deathgripson#2395
yea Im not getting too many rejects anymore I will leave it on for a while to see if it stays consistent


[01/13/2023 4:38 PM] matty_19#4994
over a couple percent and you probably want to dig in but obviously percentage will adjust over time as you get a larger sample size


[01/13/2023 4:43 PM] deathgripson#2395
seems like old version of teamredminer may be the common denominator here gonna update and see if that helps


[01/13/2023 4:48 PM] matty_19#4994
I use t rex but I'm all team green.


[01/13/2023 4:49 PM] deathgripson#2395
my nvidia rig is doing really well on gminer


[01/13/2023 4:52 PM] matty_19#4994
I've never had issues with T-rex so I've never really had a reason to change. Other than when LHR unlock became a thing I used NBminer for a little bit but I had some bugs. As soon as t rex had an unlocker I swapped back.


[01/13/2023 4:53 PM] deathgripson#2395
I will try it out


[01/13/2023 5:02 PM] deathgripson#2395
getting way less rejects w the update but there are still some, i want 0 :PB_reee:


[01/13/2023 6:04 PM] matty_19#4994
Under 1% not much to worry about but yeah 0 is obviously best lol. I nit pick on mine lol


[01/14/2023 8:53 PM] deathgripson#2395
so my large rigs are doing better in terms of rejects than my rigs which are basically single gpu PCs at the moment, any idea how I can solve this? its gotta be on the stratum side because the ocs have all been normal on 2miners pool for example


[01/14/2023 8:57 PM] matty_19#4994
Yeah maybe their network connection to the node?


[01/14/2023 8:59 PM] deathgripson#2395
I will try to get a better connection on it and see


[01/14/2023 9:08 PM] matty_19#4994
My node is hardwired and most of the rest are on wifi. When i ran the node on a wifi connected machine I saw more rejected shares. Not sure how you're set up


[01/14/2023 9:11 PM] matty_19#4994
Assuming your stratum and node are on the same unit. I'm not sure if you can try putting a copy of the stratum server on one of the further away machines and connect to the same node.


[01/14/2023 9:11 PM] deathgripson#2395
ok I havent tried running more than one stratum


[01/14/2023 9:11 PM] matty_19#4994
I haven't either so I don't know if that will work.


[01/14/2023 9:12 PM] deathgripson#2395
I gave the invalid rig a stronger connection so it should do better ill test that out for now


[01/14/2023 9:13 PM] matty_19#4994
Worst case I guess you would be running a whole other node for the further machines if it seems like a network issue


[01/14/2023 9:13 PM] matty_19#4994
Ok let me know. I'm curious now lol.


[01/14/2023 9:14 PM] deathgripson#2395
im fixing several things at once including mining rig clocks lol so it may take a little while, i hope that i get it solved today though


[01/14/2023 9:16 PM] matty_19#4994
Do you also still have difficulty on automatic?


[01/14/2023 9:16 PM] deathgripson#2395
yea


[01/14/2023 9:17 PM] matty_19#4994
And difficulty hangs out around 4g on a single gpu?


[01/14/2023 9:17 PM] deathgripson#2395
wym 4g?


[01/14/2023 9:17 PM] matty_19#4994
Share difficulty reported by miner


[01/14/2023 9:18 PM] matty_19#4994
My 3090 bounces around 3.5 to 4g difficulty


[01/14/2023 9:19 PM] deathgripson#2395
since my last restart they have been doing pretty well but yes for example i have  a 6800xt on my pc right now and it just hit a 8+ G share and yesterday something was causing it to get tons of rejects


[01/14/2023 9:19 PM] deathgripson#2395
rn its ok though


[01/14/2023 9:19 PM] deathgripson#2395
I restarted every rig and the stratum at the same time


[01/14/2023 9:19 PM] deathgripson#2395
and gave my upstairs single GPU rig a stronger connection to the network


[01/14/2023 9:20 PM] matty_19#4994
Yeah mine will swing up high from time to time as well but generally will see it in that region


[01/14/2023 9:20 PM] deathgripson#2395
also theres a setting on the stratum called jobRebroadcastTimeout that claims if you turn it to 0 it turns off the feature but infact it will just spam your rigs with jobs


[01/14/2023 9:20 PM] matty_19#4994
Yes lol


[01/14/2023 9:20 PM] deathgripson#2395
lmao


[01/14/2023 9:23 PM] deathgripson#2395
fuck


[01/14/2023 9:23 PM] deathgripson#2395
got one reject


[01/14/2023 9:28 PM] matty_19#4994
Percentage matters. 1 out of 4 is 25% rejected. 1 out of 100 shares is 1% let it run.


[01/14/2023 9:29 PM] matty_19#4994
Give it a half hour to an hour and see where you're at.


[01/14/2023 9:32 PM] matty_19#4994
Also worth trying for a short period just remove oc settings to eliminate that as a potential cause

[01/16/2023 6:18 PM] Sachin$17#1581
Need to some help to understand... That why my stratum is accepting same job ID many times... For example in this image job Id 1221 is accepted 3 times....i want to know is this normal or something wrong?


[01/16/2023 7:16 PM] matty_19#4994
Submitting multiple solutions and they are incorrect/didn't mine the block maybe?


[01/16/2023 9:09 PM] deathgripson#2395
its now only 1% rejects not sure what worked but in general thanks for the help


[01/17/2023 2:02 AM] Sachin$17#1581
@matty_19 so should I consider them as good shares or not?


[01/17/2023 2:03 AM] matty_19#4994
No worries.


[01/17/2023 2:04 AM] matty_19#4994
Well says valid share submitted so I would lean that way. That's the same thing both of my nodes/servers do.


[01/17/2023 2:07 AM] Sachin$17#1581
@matty_19 OK... But the thing is this information doesn't match with my daemon debug log file.... The shares I am submitting on stratum only 5-10% are showing on my daemon log file...


[01/17/2023 2:07 AM] matty_19#4994
I've mined 5 blocks over the last month to so it's working as far as I can tell. All the miners return the same info for valaid/rejected as is reported.


[01/17/2023 2:09 AM] matty_19#4994
@Sachin$17 yeah I'm no expert on the way the node works. There is a node channel on here as well that may be worth asking.


[01/17/2023 2:09 AM] Sachin$17#1581
@matty_19 OK...


[01/17/2023 2:12 AM] matty_19#4994
As far as im aware shares are not block solutions though. So maybe that's the difference you are seeing?


[01/17/2023 2:12 AM] matty_19#4994
Shares are a much less difficult snippet to gauge mining performance.

[01/17/2023 2:13 AM] matty_19#4994
That's the node channel.


[01/17/2023 4:02 AM] Sachin$17#1581
@matty_19 yes that I known shares are not block found solution... But my concern is should I consider accepted share Good with same job ID


[01/17/2023 4:10 AM] matty_19#4994
Well let me know if you find an answer. I'm curious.


[01/17/2023 7:25 AM] deathgripson#2395
i believe it is normal for a worker to compute more than one valid share for the same job


[01/17/2023 7:25 AM] deathgripson#2395
or atleast i also see it happening on mine


[01/17/2023 3:37 PM] deathgripson#2395
praying 4 block :prayge: :k_thumbs_up:


[01/17/2023 5:52 PM] Sachin$17#1581
@matty_19 I think it's normal...


[01/17/2023 5:53 PM] Sachin$17#1581
Because same I got it on some other coin and I was getting blocks...  But that was test net..  So I just wanted to confirm that weather this works on main net or not of ergo... But yes according to me now it should work


[01/17/2023 7:11 PM] matty_19#4994
Yeah I've hit 5 blocks since the middle of December ish so it works. Good to know it's consistent.


[01/17/2023 7:44 PM] Sachin$17#1581
@matty_19 yes it works


[01/17/2023 9:50 PM] deathgripson#2395
what hashrate u got


[01/17/2023 10:01 PM] matty_19#4994
@deathgripson 3.4 GH ish

[01/17/2023 10:03 PM] deathgripson#2395
hopefully I can get my luck back on track with better uptime


[01/20/2023 3:54 PM] matty_19#4994
the luck is not with me anymore lol, haven't hit a block since the 8th


[01/20/2023 4:33 PM] deathgripson#2395
u will hit one soon probably, i havent hit one since getblock stepped down


[01/20/2023 4:33 PM] deathgripson#2395
nfa ofcourse xD


[01/21/2023 12:36 PM] Sachin$17#1581
@matty_19 difficulty is increased... So most probably you should hit 2 blocks in next couple of days... If your hashrate is same 3.4 ghs


[01/29/2023 2:35 AM] deathgripson#2395
if i have some other nodes that my stratum server is connecting to, do they need to be set to mining = true also or just the one w the stratum?


[02/01/2023 3:35 AM] deathgripson#2395
lol miner seems to produce less rejects than any other amd ergo miner i have tried. makes my rig considerably stable

does anyone have nice newer gui for miningcore, which could recomnd?

not using mining core im just using the stratum server

thats why my tip may not have worked not sure about mining core

Any recommendation for the minimum amount of hashrate needed to support a solo mine?


[02/21/2023 3:40 PM] Sonicchemist#6523
1gh?


[02/22/2023 4:38 AM] blackinsecure#3693
more like 5


[02/22/2023 4:38 AM] blackinsecure#3693
10 to be consistent


[02/22/2023 4:41 AM] Sonicchemist#6523
Whats Consistent for you? Monthly, weekly, daily?


[02/22/2023 2:04 PM] blackinsecure#3693
being at least as advantageous as just using a pool


[02/22/2023 2:06 PM] Sonicchemist#6523
Thats already covered don't you worry about that. What's consistent?


[02/22/2023 2:06 PM] blackinsecure#3693
?


[02/22/2023 2:06 PM] Sonicchemist#6523
Your views of consistency


[02/22/2023 2:08 PM] Sonicchemist#6523
Is what you mentioned earlier.  5 to 10gh would provide consistency. What's consistency within hitting a block? Monthly weekly or daily blocks


[02/22/2023 2:08 PM] blackinsecure#3693
*with current HR* you'd need at least 5GHs to hit *on average* a block weekly


[02/22/2023 2:09 PM] Sonicchemist#6523
Awesome and thank you for that


[02/22/2023 2:10 PM] Sonicchemist#6523
Pool mining it is for now


[02/23/2023 1:55 AM] deathgripson#2395
yea even w ~2GH blocks are very inconsistent and you are probably fighting reorgs 99% of the time


[02/23/2023 1:56 AM] deathgripson#2395
when getblok was still around it was more consistent w less hash because their pool was reorging more frequently than just 2GH would for me, Im on my own pool and took me like a month to hit a block

Could someone help with miningcore ergo pool?


[03/29/2023 9:00 PM] Reggerriee#5482
I set it up, I did everything, but something is wrong, because if I find a block, it doesn't go to the pool wallet, so miningcore can't pay it.


[03/29/2023 9:00 PM] Reggerriee#5482
