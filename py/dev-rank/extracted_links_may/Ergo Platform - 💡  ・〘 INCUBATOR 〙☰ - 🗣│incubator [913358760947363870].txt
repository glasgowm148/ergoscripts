On my side, I've been only working on the development of ErgoTeam from the smart contract side. ErgoTeam will not only be for simple joint-spendings like it was initially intended where special tokens needed to be issued. I plan for it to be much more general where any already issued token would work. This will help dApps to build an ecosystem around their product easily.

To achieve that, certain procedures must be improved. That is what I am doing currently. Here is one aspect of it: https://www.ergoforum.org/t/a-more-efficient-utxo-voting/3144
I'd appreciate if community devs & ecosystem core would read it and provide feedback.

Moreover, my guys for AH are getting familiar with Ergo in general and the code base of AH to develop it further. The progress has been good.

A more efficient UTXO voting
Let‚Äôs say we have a voting contract or a joint-spending contract similar to here. In this setting voters have some specific token that allows them to have a specific ‚Äúvoting power‚Äù. For example, if there are a total of 100 of token x and Alice owns 15 x then she has 15% of the entire voting power.  We‚Äôd like to have an efficient way of voting. V...

Pulling me in as I start to consider how a dao structure could be utilized for many simple and/or complicated things, I like to think a token does not need to be used in a transaction and allowing "Alice" to keep tokens in a box and also allowing them to participate in a vote opens up new pathways of multi-use tokens where they might be in a profit-sharing/staking agreement or possibly in a collateralized loan yet they can still continue to hold weight in a vote. 

Very interesting development.

Watch out for these guys @Incubator 

Offer to setup regional community chats (or just go ahead like this guy has done), fill them with bots and spam usually and then demand payment or they'll restrict the group. What works best is setting the group up yourself, finding an existing ergonaut from the region to ensure quality/it's not spam and then reward people if they actually build up a community. Or feel free to point them to the existing regional chats in the time-being if that's easier.

Hey @Incubator - Added a guide here for getting added onto the chat bridge. (Can be set up like `Your Discord<>Ergo Discord<>Your Telegram` see #spectrum for an example). Would be good to have a channel on this Discord for every project working on Ergo as it'll help visibility/pull people in.

The amount of channels we were needing was growing exponentially so I've just switched to a #üéü‚îÇtickets channel instead. Open a ticket from here to start a channel with me, armeanio and stacie. I can add in your team members and the other EF members as required.
