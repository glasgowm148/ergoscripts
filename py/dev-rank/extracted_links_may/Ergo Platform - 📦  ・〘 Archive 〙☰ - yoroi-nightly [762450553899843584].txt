hello! i see that the main yoroi page shows balances as "ada" even if i deposited ergo. although when you enter the wallet it shows ergs... not sure if it's supposed to be like this

@morphic Yoroi is available for Firefox, but Yoroi Nightly is a public test version of Yoroi and Firefox doesn't allow uploading beta versions of extensions to their store

https://github.com/Emurgo/yoroi-frontend/pull/1756 this should fix the labeling issue. Thanks for reporting it!

In a few places we still had "ADA" hardcoded. This PR moves the remaining instances to use a variable instead

I sent a bit erg to my Yoroi wallet but it doesn't show the balance or the transaction.


[10/06/2020 6:23 PM] anon_real#2768
Even with 3 confirmations now.

[10/06/2020 7:05 PM] anon_real#2768
I sent more txs, also to newly generated addresses. Still shows nothing.


[10/06/2020 7:06 PM] anon_real#2768
Also, network shows that all requests are successful, so I think I have no connection issues.


[10/06/2020 7:53 PM] mmahut#8044
@anon_real can you try now please?

@anon_real Did the exact same again and it worked!


[10/06/2020 9:41 PM] anon_real#2768
Ignore these 3 above messages. The problem was that it doesn't show sending transactions unless they are mined which is very confusing.


[10/06/2020 9:46 PM] kushti#0978
@anon_real yes, now needed methods in the explorer are done, so pending transactions will be shown in a next release

@Sebastien HI,
1) the yoroi wallet is it open source?  Do you have the github link for the version releases please?  I am looking for the hashes/signatures to authenticate the download file.

2) you said Ledger integration for ERG is almost ready the last time.  What is status now?  Did Ledger team already audit your Ledger code, or do we have to wait for Ledger to conduct their review? Do they already have your code, have you sent it to Ledger?


[10/08/2020 1:22 PM] Sebastien#0653
@Deleted User Yoroi extension code is here https://github.com/Emurgo/yoroi-frontend

If you go to the settings page, you can find the commit that was used to build whatever release you're using.

EMURGO isn't working on Ledger integration. I think you meant to as this question to @kushti

@jasondavies hey kushti said you do the Ledger integration on Yoroi/ERG:

 you said Ledger integration for ERG is almost ready the last time.  What is status now? 

 Did Ledger team already audit your Ledger code, or do we have to wait for Ledger to conduct their review? Do they already have your app code, have you sent it to Ledger?
