This channel is now bridged with Discord. Just means I can manage it all from one place.

Where are overall rules (re @AngieHar: @sc_rice Sean, did you have a chance to think over a format guideline for contributor chat? Please let me know so that we could attach it to overall rules)


[01/31/2022 2:32 PM] MatthewHintonB#0000
I'd probably add Comparative technical analysis and use cases to the top of the list.
Additionally, half the contributors are pissed and de-motivated because they write articles and if it's not a certain standard, it doesn't get used. Should just publish them elsewhere atleast.
Not everyone is going to be keen on doing anything unless we can guarantee their contribution is actually used. I assume this issue was taken care of ? This was a core issue,
We also have 2-3 giveaways currently awaiting you to look at Angie so they can be executed (waiting on reward budget), no need to rely on contributors lets execute what we have sitting here. (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <Glasgow> Re-Forwarding and pinning. This can also be seen on the sigmanauts onboarding document. Relevant resources, FAQs, etc. Will be added here.

**Editorial contributor's program **
Like many projects, the Ergo Platform has its own editorial team to support and grow marketing efforts. The Ergo editorial team taps into the opinions of the team, ecosystem, perspectives, and insights of industry leaders for  diverse range of content to be published on Ergo’s media sources. 
This takes form in 600-1000 word submissions on trend analysis/ comparative technical analysis, news of the defi market, and/or strategic advice. After submissions are received they are edited to ensure consistent quality across Ergo’s blog and social media platforms. 
You should strive to offer commentary on the blockchain industry for the purposes of promoting and creating a dialogue about the tools and projects the Ergo Platform is building. Editorial contributors work closely with practitioners who are ac <clipped message>

Editorial
Much of Ergo's text is outdated, and written by non-natives or programmers. We need fresh content that can make Ergo understandable and accessible to everyone.

@tortodelivery anything ?

Hi Angie, here is what I created for the Contributors. I'm just catching up on the chat here (re @AngieHar: @sc_rice Sean, did you have a chance to think over a format guideline for contributor chat? Please let me know so that we could attach it to overall rules)

[01/31/2022 3:15 PM] sc_rice#0000
I can incorporate the lists Mark sent from the Sigmanaut program into this guide as well. There is some crossover information here. Thoughts? @AngieHar


[01/31/2022 3:16 PM] sc_rice#0000
They haven't gotten back to me with their recent edits. I can't help if they are upset... I understand they want to write but even when guidelines were specifically given to each of them in writing, they didn't follow them (re @MatthewHintonB: I'd probably add Comparative technical analysis and use cases to the top of the list.
Additionally, half the contributors are pissed and de-motivated because they write articles and if it's not a certain standard, it doesn't get used. Should just publish them elsewhere atleast.

[01/31/2022 3:18 PM] sc_rice#0000
I also think there is some frustration that their writing level is not good enough. It can be hard to receive critical feedback. I have been supportive and encouraging with my feedback but the reality is we can not publish work that is elementary in writing level. Grammar and sentence structure can not be sacrificed - it would look unprofessional. (re @MatthewHintonB: I'd probably add Comparative technical analysis and use cases to the top of the list.

[01/31/2022 3:19 PM] sc_rice#0000
Also, they have not conveyed any of their frustrations to me. I haven't heard from any of them since I took a few days to take the time and really point out and educate on what issues they faced in their writing.

[01/31/2022 3:24 PM] sc_rice#0000
@MatthewHintonB Jennie has been a success in that group, by the way. I think she is just really busy so she doesn't have much time to write for the group


[01/31/2022 3:24 PM] sc_rice#0000
There are only 2 other people so far that have written articles and they have been the ones that have needed a lot of work with their writing (re @MatthewHintonB: I'd probably add Comparative technical analysis and use cases to the top of the list.

There was one mistake. Can you correct in the telegram post? (re @root7Z: thank you)

I want to insert some "title screens" in my webinar video to separate the sections. do you have a pic that I could use to show the text on?


[02/04/2022 9:28 AM] AngieHar#0000
@AndyLowe Andy do you maybe have? This is for ErgoHack (re @MrStahlfelge: I want to insert some "title screens" in my webinar video to separate the sections. do you have a pic that I could use to show the text on?)


[02/04/2022 10:45 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
okay, I'll work without screens but you should add something at the beginning and end before uploading.
I am nearly done and taking a break now, will make a last review later and upload to my google drive for you in a few hours


[02/04/2022 10:46 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
length now is 43 minutes, like a good school lesson


[02/04/2022 10:47 AM] AngieHar#0000
Yes sure, Andy can help with that 
Share your file when ready 🙌👍 (re @MrStahlfelge: okay, I'll work without screens but you should add something at the beginning and end before uploading.

The reason is that the other info after loses it's power as a comment on the problems posed int he first few paragraphs

I think the bold dates at the top make it clear that it is an event? What do you think?

yes it's like 
- something1
- - something(a) about something1
  -  something(b) about that something1
  -  something(c) about something1
- something2
- - something (a) about something2
- something 3
but there is not any option in the editorial page. I can delete sub bullets if that looks strange. When I copy-paste it shows like this, and I can't even make a double one inside the tool (re @MrStahlfelge: )


[02/08/2022 9:25 AM] root7Z#0000

We'll finish the edits but I'll put it to the side until you say otherwise (re @sean_ergonaut: oh no... Thanks for letting me know)


[02/10/2022 1:40 AM] Armeanio#0000
Nothing major, just a team for the hackathon is working on a similar solution. AdaHandle team hasnt actually build anything yet as far as I know. As the community grows we need to start being careful to not pick or endorse favorites.


[02/10/2022 1:40 AM] Armeanio#0000
I think when they launch it would be a great article, but before then it might not be a good idea.


[02/10/2022 1:41 AM] sean_ergonaut#0000
got it. Thanks for the update. We will save it for publication until the appropriate time (re @Armeanio: Nothing major, just a team for the hackathon is working on a similar solution. AdaHandle team hasnt actually build anything yet as far as I know. As the community grows we need to start being careful to not pick or endorse favorites.)


[02/10/2022 1:41 AM] Armeanio#0000
Its a good problem to have honestly. Just something we need to start taking into consideration as we grow.

lol yeah truth


[02/10/2022 1:44 AM] Armeanio#0000
If the hackathon wasn't ongoing I wouldn't mind but that team has already been complaining a little.


[02/10/2022 1:44 AM] Armeanio#0000
So best to keep the peace for now.


[02/10/2022 1:44 AM] sean_ergonaut#0000

@glasgowm @root7Z Does ErgoDEX interact with regular Yoroi wallets now? Or is it still only Yoroi nightly. Just making sure we have the correct data for ErgoDesk update.
Also, those who want to can use the Nautilus download from Github while waiting for Google Chrome review, correct?

@AngieHar @sean_ergonaut Will you share the tweets that will be published today


[02/17/2022 11:15 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@AndyLowe Sorry, Andy. You’re right, it doesn’t go to the link from the video. After scheduling I went back later under “scheduled tweets” and edited the text. This was down outside of the creative options for twitter ads and im now wondering if that reset any of the media features that I had included. Will be careful of that going forward.  Twitter ads seems so far removed from the rest of Twitters functionality.


[02/17/2022 11:16 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000

[02/17/2022 11:16 PM] AndyLowe#0000
I guess we will learn from this and tweak it for the future. Likewise i will convert all vids from premiere to schedules as you are right @root7Z it is not good if someone joins a few minutes late and can't rewind. I didn't realise premieres would be like that, it's kind of weird tbh (re @sean_ergonaut: @AndyLowe Sorry, Andy. You’re right, it doesn’t go to the link from the video.

[02/17/2022 11:16 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
I'm pretty sure it's becuase I edited the text later on outside of twitter ads - did it under "scheduled tweets" in twitter. I just have to make sure that any edits have to be done inside the twitter ads option so that I can still see the call to action and video settings. That's the only reason I can imagine becuase that's what I did differently yesterday. (re @AndyLowe: did you figure out what caused the issue?)

[02/17/2022 11:16 PM] AndyLowe#0000
@root7Z can you clarify what you thought was the issue with the premiere, people could not rewind to the start? I am looking now and YouTube says that viewers should be able to rewind during the premiere. how sure are you that it was not possible?


[02/17/2022 11:18 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
Sure! Thanks


[02/17/2022 11:18 PM] root7Z#0000
i didn't say it is not possible, I said it's confusing. People can rewind during premiere but at the time of the entry, video does not show the time of the video but only writes premiere. So people need to check out to rewind it, it does not start directly from beginning (re @AndyLowe: @root7Z can you clarify what you thought was the issue with the premiere, people could not rewind to the start? I am looking now and YouTube says that viewers should be able to rewind during the premiere. how sure are you that it was not possible?)

It was my personal experience, I saw that video is moving forward, didn't know how to watch then I tried to look out if it's possible to go back and then I learn but thought that might not be the case for everyone. People might feel frustrated when they enter at the middle, there are comments sliding on the side etc (re @root7Z: i didn't say it is not possible, I said it's confusing.

@root7Z Ok, I've tweaked a few things with the article.


[02/17/2022 11:18 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@root7Z you ok with the other content things I've edited?


[02/17/2022 11:18 PM] AndyLowe#0000
Ok I understand. I think on balance, there is a benefit to the premiere system, as it allows the video links to be shareable in advance (as watch screens) which we have seen participants doing such as Johnny Wu. In the previous system of using only scheduled videos, it is simply a link to a private video up until the point it's published. So for a wider reach I think the benefits of the premiere system outweighs the issue that will only affect a few people who join a few minutes late (re @root7Z: It was my personal experience, I saw that video is moving forward, didn't know how to watch then I tried to look out if it's possible to go back and then I learn but thought that might not be the case for everyone.

@sean_ergonaut  "Does Ergo and it's Sigma Protocols offer the best platform for the future of trustless AI training?"  
I think this sentence is a bit misleading because in video there is mention of Cardano and SingularityNet, there is a mutual work and Project's name is DeepChainADA

I think both titles makes sense, the YouTube title was taken from what he talks about in the video how he started on cardano (hence the name deepchainADA) and then recently started to learn more about ergo and hasn't fully gone deep into ergo. And he says things like, with Ergos built in sigma protocols, it could be more efficient

He will expand on the Layer Two implementations beyond scaling properties. Layer Two is a very broad topic covering also interoperability and functionality on an overlaying network. The topic introduces the audience to elliptic curve cryptography and zero knowledge proofs.

[02/23/2022 4:12 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@glasgowm Do you think this is something worth tweeting about? Is the 30th rank something we should advertise?


[02/23/2022 4:12 PM] glasgowm#0000
yeah considered we’re rank #300+ in price 🙂

about the image on website, there is always 1 type of image format is possible, 800x400 horizontal and other formats expand so it broke the image (re @sean_ergonaut: @glasgowm do you know anything about the medium article for the Storage Rent Ergo explainer? Cafebedouin is asking about getting the image and spacing fixed but I can't find the article anymore on medium)


[02/23/2022 4:17 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000

[02/25/2022 2:12 PM] root7Z#0000

[02/25/2022 2:22 PM] root7Z#0000
okay so I don't understand, shouldn't we wait until Armeanio gives his points? He announced on the AMA that Hack results will be published not today but later (re @AngieHar: I duplicated the info with him in DM, I assume he would participate)


[02/25/2022 2:24 PM] AngieHar#0000

Yes sound good 
As well as will we publish a PR on that 
So if yes will need to link to a blog post (re @root7Z: I will start preparing the results template then when are we publishing  on weekend or Monday? @AngieHar)


[02/25/2022 2:36 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
We don't have blog post scheduled for today. I'm editing ErgoDesk at the moment and then have a bit a weird schedule today. We could publish the summit wrap-up later today when I have time to go through it. 
We could release it tomorrow morning as well. I think that is appropriate would be a nice a way to have more activity over the weekend for the social media accounts (re @root7Z: than should we publish this today? @sean_ergonaut)


[02/25/2022 2:37 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
We also have another contributors article in the queue that I will edit today so we have a nice steady flow of content for the next couple of days.


[02/25/2022 2:37 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@joshua_esan You will add the results to the ErgoHack PR once we have the final data, correct?

or are we talking about two separate mixer dApps? @glasgowm


[02/25/2022 4:11 PM] glasgowm#0000
Was thinking we need a pipeline for editorial. 

Currently it seems a bit fragmented. Think @sean_ergonaut usually posts to twitter. @AngieHar or @root7Z usually for the Telegram news announcements. I do reddit/Discord + rootz has started posting there.

I’m happy to continue doing that when I’m available - but could we make sure we check all these boxes if one of us is missing? Or open to any other ideas (if one person wants to take it on, or we bring in some sigmanauts to help?)

I can check it, now doing the long SM posts already so just need to post reddit too. Which articles should go CMC then I can also push that too (re @glasgowm: )


[02/25/2022 4:18 PM] glasgowm#0000
Things that aren’t primarily for within the community probably.


[02/25/2022 4:18 PM] glasgowm#0000

[02/25/2022 4:18 PM] glasgowm#0000

send me your reddit username and I’ll mod you so you can pin stuff too


[02/25/2022 4:19 PM] AngieHar#0000
to my mind it has to be just one publisher, so called smm manager who just take the material and post everywhere (re @glasgowm: )


[02/25/2022 4:22 PM] glasgowm#0000
i dont know if that exists does it

[02/25/2022 4:28 PM] AngieHar#0000
If you remember we had the same structure using trello, same stages but it didn’t work 
To my mind the solution is to have one social media manager with all accesses yes (re @glasgowm: )

what manager do you need for stages? I already posting telegram, blockfolio, news if needed and now also started to post discord. Can just post to reddit and cmc  along as well. (re @AngieHar: If you remember we had the same structure using trello, same stages but it didn’t work

[02/25/2022 5:11 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@glasgowm @AngieHar would it be in poor form to directly compare why Ergo is better than RVN in social media posts? Is that too negative


[02/25/2022 5:15 PM] glasgowm#0000
yeh might be - depends I guess.

[02/25/2022 5:26 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
I’m looking at the info you sent comparing ergo and rvn and just wondering how we can increase traction and steal a portion of their market over to Ergo (re @AngieHar: Not sure what you mean)


[02/25/2022 5:41 PM] AngieHar#0000
From what I see they have more referral traffic (re @sean_ergonaut: I’m looking at the info you sent comparing ergo and rvn and just wondering how we can increase traction and steal a portion of their market over to Ergo)


[02/25/2022 5:41 PM] AngieHar#0000
And it’s paid

It's not a question of want Angie, I'm already doing. I don't understand how many managers do you need for every separate task and I don't know how do you supervision the Ergo ecosystem or make real marketing plans related with ecosystem growth (re @AngieHar: If you want to do everything, please do everything)

As for ecosystem- yes it’s a structure, but I was told that it’s business of each team separately as the aim to make it work autonomously 
It all goes this direction (re @root7Z: It's not a question of want Angie, I'm already doing. I don't understand how many managers do you need for every separate task and I don't know how do you supervision the Ergo ecosystem or make real marketing plans related with ecosystem growth)

But concretely, I am expecting some guidance on niche marketing, making product pitches, competitor analysis related with product marketing, examples from other competitors to how to build community, feed us with current trends to help us build content plans just some guidance and food for thought generally


[02/25/2022 6:28 PM] AngieHar#0000
In the first link there is a competitor analysis 
Btw we have started this spreadsheet with you but then stoped keep going forward, I don’t know why 
But anyway you can take a look
As for other requests, you’re completely right, you highlighted PRODUCT marketing, which leads to  performance marketing that we don’t do because we are blockchain 
Blockchain marketing aims at brand awareness, at least it’s common concepts 
Maybe you have working cases, feel free to share (re @root7Z: But concretely, I am expecting some guidance on niche marketing, making product pitches, competitor analysis related with product marketing, examples from other competitors to how to build community, feed us with current trends to help us build content plans just some guidance and food for thought generally)


[02/25/2022 11:28 PM] root7Z#0000
I'm trying to understand what kind of path should we follow. I started that docs I shared above, that's good for content producing but still; I feel that we are lacking a roadmap for making brand awareness. Should I do that? I am writing articles but at this point I started to feel aimless, I need some guidance about structures. As our marketing manager(or marketing head) I am expecting you to show us a way for 3-6-9 months. Not only monday-blog tuesday-dictionary kind of thing but with plans and concrete subjects, or I feel that it is becoming messy with random articles.
Please explain how are we not doing PRODUCT marketing, is Ergo not a product? What is your angle to market Ergo? Like I said, I felt aimless so I started to working as I already sent a couple pages of intro to Ergo content production. There is that Ergo Decrypt Glasgow sent and there are Key Value Propositions, so should I think a way to make it a structure or is it you? You said we will publish 2-3 monthly PRs, what do you think to publish 2 months later? what do you think to publish 5 months later? Tell us so we will be prepared. Also maybe we need regular Marketing meetings aside from Ergonauts meetings (re @AngieHar: In the first link there is a competitor analysis

I agree with you on more clear content planning. However there is no way to plan content for 3-6-9 months. It’s just doesn’t make sense as you can’t plan trends in advance. The only thing that you can do is 1 month max, taking into consideration brand consistency- regularity and timing. 
Another thing for content marketing is that specifically our blog is not seen in accordance with analytics. I mentioned it several times earlier. 
In order to make the content seen, it’s highly needed to work on seo optimization of the content, specifically keywords. 
I remember we talked about this several months ago, as well as with Sakata, but never mind. Usually copywriters should have this skillset to use in their content. But here we learn every day. 
In terms of product marketing- this includes product marketing sales of the product, relevant product analytics- this require a specific skillset, all in all it’s always about money. In terms of marketing of a product it’s better give an example. For example ergo wallet is a product that can be promoted. In general it’s all the same structure of marketing strategy including analytical part and product marketing kit. However, we would need a specific action from the marketing like we want to get 1000 installs of the application from google pay. We can start performance advertising that will lead to a concrete action - to get this 1000 downloads. For example we see from our funnel that in order to make 1000 downloads we need to get at least 10000 clicks, therefore we need to buy 1,000,000 impressions ( but that’s an example, I just assume possible conversion rates) 
So it’s a bit different, because in terms of blockchain we can’t promote to install smth, it’s not targeted action and people who is not in the loop will never be interested in blockchain itself. So that’s why there was a proposal to promote education, ergoskript courses

okay so regarding that bootcamp, maybe we can collaborate with DeCo? Promote their campaigns? make PRs for them? idk, let's think
about analytics, I am really curious because I rarely use google search (using duckduckgo) how do people search cryptocurrencies? What is the role of SEO in here? Maybe we can try SEO tools on internet? I always check known researchers or just scroll through Coingecko. I also heard that SEO ranks can be manipulated easily, I feel that a strategy for word of mouth would be more beneficent so we should look for ways to expand through our neighbour communities who wants to try and diversify. 
So to use some Occam's razor, we don't have a high budget right? What is the return rate on paid ads, would it be better to spend it on twitter ads or continue pushing on Tier 2 news channels? Or maybe we pay influencers, in which conditions? As a product, maybe we just randomly pay incentives to the 100 Swaps from 10000 swaps on Ergodex so it would increase the interaction, or likewise incentives? Or we make Like-retweet-join airdrops kind of twitter promotions? This Quiz promotion for example, why didn't we promoted it before the summit- maybe we can make it every 2-3 weeks etc.
For 3-6-9 months plans, we should push devs and set due dates maybe? Like we have simple things ErgoHack and Summit, let's start defining when are we going to first publish the announce and in what frequency? Create a semi-flexible plan with events on the side, defined topics on the side and free space for contributors? (re @AngieHar: I agree with you on more clear content planning.

let's continue tomorrow, no worries, good night. 
I see the calendar but my problem persists, let's define it more than just writing blog posts, to make it a key value proposition plan as all marketing team. Set announce dates for events so we prepare an announce, maybe a circular promotion plan that supports Ergo dApps etc. (re @AngieHar: I shared timeline with you

okay so maybe we should push these directly to discord? Or maybe we can incentivize discussions in other mining groups? I think we shouldn't ask kushti for political advice for all cases, let's guest him on social media channels for open discussion etc. we can react faster if we provide our own views, something about consensus, something about miner economy, something about history and how is it nonsense, what are other energy uses etc. we can debate and push faster. These are ongoing discussions that come and go, and there are other discussions such as oppression, sovereignty, accessibility etc. (re @AngieHar: @root7Z look, here is the topic

I think plan number one is superficial- most of the things are broad and aren't defined
Strengths:
Smart Contracts on PoW (?, isn't this opposing Cardano?) - NFT (is there any chain left without NFT?) - Accessible worldwide, No need for intermediaries (definition of cryptocurrencies, also a problematic proposal regarding exchange numbers) 
Weakness:
Governance (?), Use Cases (what about possibilities?), 
opportunities
Fast income (?), Usable for purchases (like any currency?)
Threats
And how will we solve these in the future?
I like the structure, it's enlightening but I feel it's generic. Like which influencers, etc. there are zero details on future pipeline other than a general how to market 101 structure
About budget, I think terms are not defined, like how much content writers, designers, seo programmers, paid ads cost. How to promise 3 regular contents, what to cover in PR blasts - edit: for second I think it's about working with what budget we have and strengthening our connections, considering the world is going through stress and markets are not bullish as before so influencer marketing may not work, maybe we should spend the budget for education more etc. (re @AngieHar: This was my plan number one

Orhan, thank you for your feedback 
But for me it seems like you’re not in the loop, like it’s just bold text. These documents were conducted several months ago, and many things changed from the moment, as well as influencers lists and etc. 
You literally ask me where is this where is this and so on. 
You are always free to share the same info, nobody stopped you. So why are you asking me about this? Yes I do have a list of influencers as I have agency and partner contractors
I was about to approve this in terms of budget for a really long time and literally   tired of just discussing things but not doing them.

No, you requested money. I asked about your money from those who is responsible for money. I do not set salaries.

In terms of planning I highlighted on the meeting: 
Promo of events
Website relaunch with relevant promo 
Targeting campaign for products 
Strong PR set with agency (re @root7Z: I demanded position very clearly a couple weeks ago, now waiting response (also is this ad hominem outside of the current topic?).

I hope you don’t mind but I edited that list out so that the article focused on the results. I linked your ErgoHack Wrap-Up though and mentioned that people can review all the submissions there (re @root7Z: @sean_ergonaut are we not going to mention the rest of the teams and their results?)


[03/01/2022 11:56 AM] root7Z#0000
yeah no problem I thought people would like to read reviews on other teams too and also other teams would like to see their points

Hello everyone, I had a talk with Angie and Anastacia before Armeanio's announce. Unrelated with today's news, I decided to pass to contributors' group due to management vision. I informed Angie about the social media pipeline. At this moment I'm not sure how will be the process but officially I'm not in editorial group. I was going to gather extra docs and news sources to publish here in case you need, but I think it's possible to just publish in contributors' group. I also needed to take a step outside to see if my comments are wrong. So if nothing is needed on my side at the moment, please kick me or I'll leave by tomorrow. ErgoSummit wrap-up is somewhere above, I'll get notification if there's a comment or please go ahead and publish. I will be around in Sigmanauts chat, so see you

I could probably talk about the pros and cons of different wallets. I've used Yoroi, Nautilus, SafeW and Ergo Wallet on Android. I prefer the last two, but I think they all have a niche to fill.


[03/03/2022 6:04 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Another thing I was talking about with curbsideprophet yesterday is that there's a way to autogenerate fact sheets using R and R Studio, where you create a template, and use something like knitr and pandoc through a front-end like RStudio to automatically generate certain statistics. This could be an ongoing thing you could publish to chart Ergos development that could be published like once a month. I'm not sure how easy it would be to set that up the data he has, but it's something I wanted to look into.

I've approached Capt Nemo to see if I she would be open to my doing a profile on her. She is an obviously very private person but it would be a way to profile a wickedly good developer while accomplishing a bouquet of goals, namely: presenting as much of her as she is willing to share with the community, showcasing Ergo, development on Ergo, and Nautilus.
And last but not least: give attention to women and development, and hopefully encourage more to come forth and develop on Ergo *and* show younger girls that if they are so inclined tech is a welcoming space for them too. (re @AngieHar: Wonderful

But I’m not sure how to embed in text images in cms, but I believe it won’t be a problem (re @cafebedouin: A wallet how-to is going to require images. Is it something you are going to host on Medium?)


[03/03/2022 8:10 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Last time, there was a certain width requirement. For example, your heading is 1280 pixels. So, I think when I reviewed above they said that the images auto-size based on the first image. All of which is fine, you could line up a sequence for a partcular task. It just helps to know those technical requirements before you start.


[03/03/2022 8:14 PM] cafebedouin#0000
I'll try my hand at the Nautilus wallet how-to. Maybe the thing to do is work on a Google doc and then do a version in markdown, so it can be added to the github repo as well.

Ok! (re @sean_ergonaut: @ergomergoadargo Are you able to tackle an article to be published for next Thursday? Sharing the draft with me here by Tuesday or Wednesday? Thanks)


[03/03/2022 8:31 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
What are looking to write about? (re @ergomergoadargo: Ok!)


[03/03/2022 8:33 PM] ergomergoadargo#0000
Idk exactly. I'll have to think of something.


[03/03/2022 8:33 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
Since @cafebedouin  is doing NFT minting, you can do the Nautilus how-to? (re @ergomergoadargo: Idk exactly. I'll have to think of something.)


[03/03/2022 8:33 PM] cafebedouin#0000
I wrote it, and then I told Marty he could do whatever he wanted with it. I think he made some small changes. I just checked in with him, and he said it was fine to use it. So, no plagarism issues. The only thing is it will need to be reworked as a general article and it will also have to talk about Ergo Teams, which I don't know anything about. (re @sean_ergonaut: Did you write that article? or was it a collaborative article?)


[03/03/2022 8:34 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
Ok, let's start with the general article. (re @cafebedouin: I wrote it, and then I told Marty he could do whatever he wanted with it. I think he made some small changes.

Yes.

[03/03/2022 9:05 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@glasgowm one last question. sorry to bother! 
I'm looking at the recent Ergo dev updates and Kushti is talking how he made a new PR for dynamic checkpointing. What is he referring to with PR? In other words, what does PR mean here?


[03/03/2022 9:05 PM] glasgowm#0000
So the node takes a checkpoint and saves the state so it can restore. Like in a video game


[03/03/2022 9:06 PM] glasgowm#0000
Pr is pull request. When you're meeting code into a repo


[03/03/2022 9:06 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
ahhh... ok. thanks!

The Minting a NFT piece is largely done. It's mostly a process document. It could have been done in a different style that talked about different use cases, the best file formats (PNG is lossless, JPG isn't - much like OGG vs. MP3), timing of auctions (do auctions that end on the weekend do better? Good question! I don't know). It also suggests companion pieces: how to list an auction, how to burn NFTs/tokens (since you'll make a mistake either in writing the description, a problem in the file you are attaching you didn't notice or whatever), focus on different use cases (can you sell limited edition ebooks?)  and so forth.

When I think about what you need, you've specified that you need 3 articles a week. That's 12 a month. I'm interested in doing one, maybe two, articles a month. So, this means you need probably something like 10 people like me to meet your content requirements. And, as a minimum, you need at least 3 people doing 1 article a week.  You know this, of course, but I can look around, and it doesn't seem like you have that many people. You might need to recruit more writers.


[03/05/2022 11:19 AM] cafebedouin#0000
Beyond the marketing, there's just regular documentation. The auction house definitely needs an explanation of the file formats it supports and other details that I can't find anywhere.


[03/05/2022 11:28 AM] AngieHar#0000
We have Sean and yet contributor chatroom 
We had two copywriters but they left this week due to finals and personal issues 
So yeah, we are in need of copywriters 🙃 (re @cafebedouin: When I think about what you need, you've specified that you need 3 articles a week. That's 12 a month.

[03/05/2022 11:29 AM] cafebedouin#0000
And, as a practical matter, if you say you pay $20 per 150 words, you should pay that. My two articles were 677 and 778 words. If we assume the 150 threshold, that's $180, yeah? But, I got paid $120. In my case. I don't really do anything for money. But, if I were like most people and it mattered, that $60 difference might be a problem. If you are going to do a $60 per article, then you should say that. I don't know what the going rate for writers is, but I do know it takes me at least 4 hours to do one of these and maybe as much as twice that. This may be something to consider when you're looking for more writers.

Auction house is an independent dApp, its their job to provide documentation for their dapp. That's not a job for EF marketing team, especially now considering how big ergo ecosystem has become, it would be impossible to provide that for every dApp (re @cafebedouin: Beyond the marketing, there's just regular documentation. The auction house definitely needs an explanation of the file formats it supports and other details that I can't find anywhere.)


[03/05/2022 4:26 PM] cafebedouin#0000
It's also true of Ergo proper. For example, I've seen Glasgow mention various switches when setting up a node that I haven't seen documented anywhere else. It's not a EF marketing problem, but then again, I'm not a part of EF marketing, beyond writing three articles, and don't look at the world through that lens.

I was thinking more about the syncing of nodes. I kept having trouble doing it on Linux. Windows was a bit easier, but it still required a lot of restarts and so forth.

The one-liner should work on all linux/mac on the next stable release. The extra config settings (`keepVersions` and blocksToKeep become unneccessary then as they’re changed dynamically).

It'll require some work to get it to look right, since I thought images would make it easier to understand.


[03/07/2022 1:58 AM] cafebedouin#0000
I haven't started editing the DAO one yet. I probably need to take a closer rook at Ergo Team before writing it.


[03/07/2022 1:59 AM] sean_ergonaut#0000
Sounds good. I’ve used screen shots in the past if that helps with describing what users will see for the minting experience (re @cafebedouin: It'll require some work to get it to look right, since I thought images would make it easier to understand.)

@AngieHar Let me know if you have any issues corresponding those images with the ones in the doc. The ones I put into the doc were as high quality as I could get for screenshots


[03/10/2022 9:11 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
If anyone wants to take a look at the doc and/or the images just to double check I didn't reveal my identity. Pretty sure I didn't, but eyes get tired after editing screenshots for a while.


[03/10/2022 9:54 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@AngieHar I made a couple of formatting changes to the article. It should be ok, I don't think you have copied it yet for uploading?

[03/11/2022 3:14 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@glasgowm @Armeanio I'm doing ErgoDesk Digest on EIP-27. I have a couple of questions.
Do we have confirmation that the vote passed? 
Orginally, it was scheduled to be instituted at Block 699393, correct?
Kushti mentioned he has implemented it on the testnet. Does that mean it is just a matter of time before it is deployed on the mainnet? If so, what is the schedule start date?
Are these questions we have answers to?
Thanks so much!


[03/11/2022 3:15 PM] glasgowm#0000
~30 days kushti estimated


[03/11/2022 3:18 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
Ok, so the vote officially passed. Last I saw, it was "looking like" the pools were indicating approval for the soft fork. 
This ErgoDesk digest is meant to be brief and quick news. (re @glasgowm: ~30 days kushti estimated)


[03/11/2022 3:19 PM] glasgowm#0000
All major pools will support the fork/activation.


[03/11/2022 3:19 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
Thanks! (re @glasgowm: All pools will support the fork/activation.)

[03/11/2022 4:18 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
last question about this. Do we have an exact number of years that this will extend emission once implemented on mainnet? (re @glasgowm: All major pools will support the fork/activation.)

I did another revision. It's not a separate paragraph. But, I provided more detail about Paideia.

Right now, he has a link to a Google Doc for a white paper. A few weeks from now, he'll come out with a PDF that has been worked on by a graphics designer, I think.


[03/15/2022 5:54 PM] cafebedouin#0000
He'll probably keep the Google document up though, so it might be able to be left as is.


[03/15/2022 5:55 PM] AngieHar#0000
can we add at least one sentence to conclusion smth like that's going to evolve in Ergo ecosystem and the info will be updated
just the conclusion is too small, but at least we can give the last sentence to think of it, or maybe add a quote

[03/15/2022 5:58 PM] cafebedouin#0000
It's a short conclusion. Three sentences. So, I can see what you are saying, but at the same time, I don't know what to add that would flesh it out beyond what has already been said. It's hard to say what the shape of DAOs will be moving forward beyond they present a real opportunity for blockchains to provide a new model of organization.


[03/15/2022 5:59 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@AngieHar I agree. Because it hasn’t been deployed yet, it’s better to be speculative and suggestive I think (re @cafebedouin: It's a short conclusion. Three sentences. So, ...)

[03/15/2022 6:02 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
I think @cafebedouin has suggested most of those things. Because we don’t have DAO’s on Ergo yet, we can’t name specific DAO’s. Also, the coin desk article seems to have a singular view of what a DAO as mostly investment collectives (re @AngieHar: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/27/w...)

[03/15/2022 6:04 PM] cafebedouin#0000
It's also doing something different. This is a critique, showing different applications and the need to be clear about what you want to accomplish. I think Paideia is trying to make a general purpose DAO creation and management tool, which covers a lot of ground. It also has the problem that it is mostly an idea. When the idea meets trying to implement in code, it may look like something very different. (re @sean_ergonaut: I think @cafebedouin has suggested most of tho...)

2. Listing announcement 
3. one PR for Next Hackathon ( maybe we'll make it with ErgoPad) (April/May?)
+ Text for intro ( ergohack,io): broad topic DeFI 
4. series of articles about Ergo and DeFI ( 3-4 posts: Telegram/ web blog/ Medium) ( starting this week)
5. additionally Ecosystem Promo week News announcement ( In Youtube; small presentations of projects with their updates for Youtube channel)

[03/21/2022 8:54 PM] cafebedouin#0000
I'd guess this is in the top five and might be the top question about Ergo. It's also a difficult topic to provide a concise answer to because you probably need to talk about externalities in energy production - many of which are not reflected in costs, ways of thinking about energy, risks/benefits when using resources for a particular application, etc. First thought is to use street lights as a metaphor. But, I think this article requires a level of care to make sure it can serve as a default to refer people to when they ask: Why proof of work? No way I'll be able to get that done in a day or two. I'm not even sure I'll be able to write a good one. Agree with @glasgowm that this would be a good article to have. (re @sean_ergonaut: @cafebedouin could you tackle this topic for t...)

Hey, friends


[03/22/2022 1:06 AM] sean_ergonaut#0000
Thanks, Angie. I'll start to prepare the PR stuff. 
@cafebedouin - you're working on the PoW and energy article. 
Me - I'll have an article tomorrow to continue the mining how-to from last week - as a companion piece to the mining on Windows, I'll do mining in Hive OS. @AngieHar I can even make a video how-to to accompany the article but I won't have that ready for tomorrow. I wonder if it is something we can use as an ErgoDesk update instead? If there is interest in this, we could also create a how-to video for the mining in Windows? I have all the equipment needed for production and post-production. To make sure it is on brand, I can send to Andy to put Ergo video tags (intro/outro) on the video.
TIMRΣG7 We have a google sheet doc that is pinned in this channel for content. I'm wondering if you would be comfortable working on an article that covers something like: NIPoPoWs, eUTXO, Interoperability, or ErgoScript? It can be technical and/or suggestive in terms of the future of Ergo. For the blog, we don't need it to be more than 2-3 pages tops (1.5-2 is often perfect for length). If it feels like a longer article for the subject you chose, we can split it up into a couple of articles or a series. Thoughts? If possible, would this be something you could do for next week? Just let me know. Thanks!
@ergomergoadargo Hey Jennie, do you have anything you'd like to write about in the community right now?

@tortodelivery Hi Marcelo 👋 Hope you're doing great 
can i request a new banner for ergo hackathon please? for ergohack.io


[03/25/2022 1:18 PM] cafebedouin#0000
I have a draft for the PoW and energy article. Audience is people who ask: Isn't PoW obsolete? Or, what about PoW energy consumption? Since it is trying to get people to change their point of view and not only information, it's a bit longer than I'd normally write. Three things that it occurs to me that might help: 1) Have I missed some important aspect of this that needs to be addressed? 2) Someone to check my math and unit conversions. I'm not normally dealing with terawatt hours / billion kilowatt hours, so it would be good if someone would double check it. 3) Does anyone know how much more energy efficient Ergo is than Bitcoin? It would be good if it could be quantified in some way. It's one thing to say more energy efficient. It's another thing to say that Ergo uses 25% less energy than Bitcoin. I focused on Bitcoin because that's what people are thinking about, and if you make the argument for bitcoin, you've made it for PoW. After @Armeanio, @glasgowm , @sean_ergonaut , et al take a look here, I'd also like to drop it into the Content Contributors chat, just to get a few more people to take a look and see if something else should be in it. I think this will work, but I don't have any perspective on it anymore. So, I thought I'd ask for comments at this point. Appreciate any help or suggestions you may have. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xsFxOkvaXdR7pEB8sxFUDSvt_L-OzxI53RpFDGzzmhk/edit?usp=sharing

[03/25/2022 2:35 PM] glasgowm#0000
Same - but on a quick skim.
Think it’s quite a hard thing to quantity/compare. Even the BTC figures are just a total. Think LETS is a good argument to add as a concrete implementation of something that could reduce energy use. Maybe NiPoPoWs too? or maybe any benefits here are neglible compared to the actual mining.

Think it’s quite ... 
I understand LETS from a anarchist perspective. Community currencies are one way to subvert large, exploitive monetary systems. But, I don't understand them well from a blockchain implementation perspective. Are they a L1 or L2 solution? Does it allow for different consensus mechanisms and turns PoW into a hybrid PoW on L1 and PoS on L2? I don't understand how they work, and we don't have working implementations of them on Ergo (although this is also true of NiPPoWs). 
I have a rough idea of NiPPoWs. It's a kind of checksum hash for the blockchain and transactions. So, I could lean into that one more, since it is a unique feature of PoW that isn't found elsewhere and I understand it well enough to make a simple argument about it.

Ideally l2 for lowest tx fees possible. 
Aside from the anarchists grander perspective it is very useful just as a community tool. 
Build local trust and resilience.


[03/25/2022 4:09 PM] Armeanio#0000
My thinking anyway l2 for the fee advantage. 
Compression techniques nipopow or fly client etc just provide increased trust assumptions in ultra lite environments.


[03/25/2022 4:11 PM] Armeanio#0000
For a smooth ux something like that likely needs a mobile build. With Qr generation.

It's a useful tool. But, it's also worth recognizing that like capitalism more generally, alternatives are not tolerated and are systematically undermined from the outside.
This is also getting into the fact that I don't understand L2s well. I get the general concept of sidechains. I also get the idea of chaining and compressing transactions that are confirmed in L1. There just seems to be a lot of devil in those details that I haven't wrapped my mind around yet.

Hi writer, I think it is necessary to write an article for this great interview.


[03/29/2022 1:09 PM] Rongrong21#0000
This interview almost introduces all advantages of Ergo using the expressions that can be understandable to ordinary people.


[03/29/2022 1:10 PM] Rongrong21#0000
@Armeanio Great job! 👍👍👍👍👍


[03/29/2022 1:11 PM] Rongrong21#0000
In order to shorten the article, the writer can make summarization for the interview.

Agreed! It was a great interview! I wonder if it is better to promote it on social media though instead of writing an article about it. The information has the potential to be more immediate and clear via sharing of the video. @AngieHar Thoughts?

[03/30/2022 3:16 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Hey @glasgowm , @sean_ergonaut asked if I could take a look at the "Change the Code" ad campaign and maybe adapting the PoW article to it. Looking at this Bloomberg article, it strikes me as there are a variety of ways you could respond. One, you could try to attempt to address the campaign head-on, and talk about the advantages of proof of work, and keep it positive. Two, you could do a compare and contrast with a supposedly more energy efficient network like XRP and what those trade-offs involve. Three, you could accept the criticism and position Ergo as the Better Bitcoin. 
My sense is that this is an announcement of the beginning of an advertising campaign. So, another question is whether people are paying attention to it and Streisand/Slashdot effect, By responding, you are acknowledging that there is a criticism that needs to be responded to and putting yourself in the same category as Bitcoin. You could avoid this discussion all together and simply say that the argument that Ergo is bringing on climate change is patently absurd. So, I'm happy to write something to address the campaign. I'd be happy to do a tear down of the absurdities of this campaign, but I'm not so sure that's good PR for Ergo. 
Any thoughts on how to approach it before I get started? https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-29/greenpeace-crypto-billionaire-lobby-to-change-bitcoin-s-code

Cool! I really need to sit down and learn some of this new tooling (for me) like Figma, Canva and others, which is part of what is great about crypto, I learn about these things when I otherwise wouldn't know they exist at all. Really appreciate the offer!


[04/01/2022 1:32 PM] Jεnniε D#0000
Canva is really very easy. Figma, I gave up on. 😄


[04/01/2022 1:35 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Some tools just take a long time to learn and aren't worth the time unless you work in the industry. I can use photoshop to do simple things like remove a background or whatever. But, a real pro can do things with most people cannot imagine. Figma's probably more in that realm.

Is there a problem with the way we’ve positioned there application in Ergo?


[04/01/2022 3:44 PM] glasgowm#0000
top of the gfx says ‘ERGO INNOVATION’


[04/01/2022 3:44 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@glasgowm the blog post includes references to white papers from IOHK at the end


[04/01/2022 3:45 PM] glasgowm#0000

> *(re @glasgowm)*: yeh was only meaning the graphic - looks like ... 
Ok, we will change that. Thanks. The blog is called Ergo Innovation as well. We should rework that also.


[04/01/2022 3:47 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@AngieHar i’m going to change the title in the doc before publishing


[04/01/2022 3:47 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@glasgowm  how about this instead for the graphic and title:
Technology and Ergo: NIPoPoWs


[04/01/2022 3:48 PM] AngieHar#0000
Maybe leave the word innovation, but playing it like innovation Ergo uses ..


[04/01/2022 3:48 PM] glasgowm#0000
yeh thats what i was going to say ‘ergos innovations’ maybe - but still maybe unclear


[04/01/2022 3:49 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
It still reads as if it was invented by Ergo… will think about this for a few minutes


[04/01/2022 3:49 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000

@cafebedouin or TIMRΣG7, could you assist with editing the graphic? Trying to find a way for the graphic title not look like it’s invented by Ergo

Thanks for catching that, Mark!


[04/01/2022 4:01 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@AngieHar I know we’d like to have the word innovation there but it doesn’t really work so well in the title when trying to associate it with Ergo and not take credit. It becomes a very long title
I propose:
NIPoPoWs on Ergo


[04/01/2022 4:02 PM] TIMRΣG7#0000
I can edit the graphic. Just lmk


[04/01/2022 4:03 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
The graphic for sure we will change to:
NIPoPoWs on Ergo


[04/01/2022 4:03 PM] TIMRΣG7#0000
I'd also point out that I do cite the IOG papers and avoided claiming that Ergo or Alex invented anything. Ergo Innovation is catchy


[04/01/2022 4:03 PM] TIMRΣG7#0000
Ok


[04/01/2022 4:04 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
TIMRΣG7 your graphic is awesome and has the potential to be shared widely which can lead to misunderstanding for those who don’t read your article. 
I will think on the title of the article a little more


[04/01/2022 4:04 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
TIMRΣG7 so for the graphic we will do:
NIPoPoWs on Ergo
Thanks! :)


[04/01/2022 4:06 PM] TIMRΣG7#0000
Yeah?

@AngieHar final answer I promise haha

I think this touches all the points raised. The IOG papers are listed at the end of the article so there shouldn’t be any misunderstanding with regards to crediting and the publication of this post.

The other doc is a really clever and charming piece written by B T in the Contributors Group. It is about trying to explain what a crypto wallet is to his father and anyone else that is completely ignorant to the industry. I think it's a great idea for a series that invites complete newcomers into the ecosystem - helping them feel like it's ok to know nothing and that most of us started out that way.

I just think it’s very small percent of people on the platform 
So it’s better to have a discussion of it in social media to my mind


[04/05/2022 2:10 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
Ok! I'll finish editing it now because it is very close to being finished.


[04/05/2022 2:11 PM] AngieHar#0000
Okay, let me know and we’ll think of the formatting


[04/05/2022 3:15 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@AngieHar I've finished the article. B T is probably asleep so I made decisions on his behalf to finish it. Let me know what you think and I can publish it to Medium

[04/07/2022 3:50 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
This was a title I came up with. I’m not sure about it yet. The reason I chose that is because there is a narrative quality that talks about the different people who inspired the creation of SkyHarbor

Oh! Lol sorry

So, I am interested in writing about a couple of topics. The first is about the philosophy of privacy; why the government & big tech is violating your rights by collecting data or demanding that they should be able to monitor your transactions. The second would be a comparative analysis on the carbon footprint of PoW vs single use plastics. Any preference?

Why privacy matters could be great I think. There is a casual attitude about it often "why do I care, I am not hiding millions in the Caymans" etc.


[04/08/2022 6:21 AM] Jεnniε D#0000
They both seem very interesting though. I look fwd to reading it, whichever one you choose :)

@sean_ergonaut Sean, could you please guide about articles for this week?


[04/11/2022 6:41 PM] Jεnniε D#0000
If you have a subject and something is missing I can try (emphasis: try) jotting down something for thursday because the Auction House piece will take a while.


[04/11/2022 7:20 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
Hi Angie, I have the AMA Wrap-Up coming and I will write a piece on the Ergo Pulse with Charles Hoskinson


[04/11/2022 7:22 PM] BridgeBot#9505
sean_ergonaut I'll update the content planning to highlight what articles are in works. We have a some technical articles assigned but they won't ready until next week. We also have a few articles for Mark for the new website. 

Are there any updates on the drafted PRs for this week?

And is there any news about ErgoHack Fest?

Thanks!


[04/11/2022 7:24 PM] BridgeBot#9505
sean_ergonaut I think it will be ok for this week. Can you give me an estimate on the Auction House article you’re doing?


[04/11/2022 7:25 PM] Jεnniε D#0000
Another ten days-ish?


[04/11/2022 7:25 PM] Jεnniε D#0000
I may be overstimating the time this will take but I'll keep you posted

Hello @sean_ergonaut, hello everybody. DeCo has set up a raffle to fund their program. I think it is one of the most valuable things happening on ergo right now to be honest.


[04/15/2022 4:33 PM] Jεnniε D#0000

Hi guys, please write a news about ergohack fest and place it on the website of ergoplatform. Some developers fail to find the true source of the ergohack fest.

 Actually, the first vote was an indicative vote. Once implemented, it will have until that block height to have 90% of the hashrate make a change in their node to indicate approval. So, official vote hasn't happened yet.

 please let me know


[05/05/2022 11:24 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@Armeanio @glasgowm this is the only sentence that suggests vote already passed. I worded this with the understanding that the mining community has indicated approval for the proposal. I mention the testnet implementation to reenforce that.


[05/05/2022 11:25 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
“The mining community voted over 90% in favor of this proposal and after successful testnet implementation, the new emission schedule is slated for deployment with block #777217.”


[05/05/2022 11:32 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000

Would there be space for a light-hearted article about the paradox of the bear market not hitting the Ergonaut community? It would be a superficial overview of everything going on in our ecosystem, underlining, I suppose, how building is more important.

Forwarded from louis_berlin_style: On a slightly more serious note:
This week has been very difficult for many people. I hope everyone is coping ok.
I want so share that it’s Mental Health Awareness Week runs from Monday 9 - Sunday 15 May 
because of the volatility of the products - I feel that crypto organisations have certain a duty of care to share guidance and facts about supporting mental health while investing in crypto. Everyone has experienced moments being in the space for so long, so it’s good to talk openly about this and form a healthy community culture around mental health. 
As a suggestion maybe the Ergo can make a few posts over the weekend for mental health awareness week. Perhaps by sharing resources to help people cope who might be facing mental health difficulties during this period.

 I want to confirm all the info in this before we are set to publish. So far, I know that Nautlius wallet is beta testing Ledger integration but they are only able to use Nano S at the moment.

 Ledger live is a seperate thing that we are not integrating into.
Will be available for all standard devices once out of beta and approved by the ledger team for their app store. (Via nautilus and other wallets who integrate,)

(re @AndyLowe : *great article. Who is Oliver Dale, the author? are they an ergonaut?*) 
 
 This is the article that TIMREG7 wrote. It was so good we went the route of getting it media attention. I don’t know why the author is listed as Oliver…


[05/22/2022 3:22 AM] AndyLowe#0000
where is TIMREG7's original article posted?

so is this posted anywhere else? like reddit etc

2. How to see how profitable you are with a given hashrate (whattomine)
3. Tips on how to optimize your GPUs for mining ergo
4. How to find the most efficient GPUs
5. How to build a rig
6. How ETH miners will pile onto ergo when the difficulty is low and and then leave again when it adjusts
7. Why mine ergo after the merge, list all the pros, like working dex

 My strengths are as a user. I don't know much about Ergoscript beyond it's a subset of Scala. I have a general idea of Ergopay, but there aren't many implementations. To my knowledge, only Ergopad uses it when staking. Ergopay needs the dapp to run a server in the background. I use Ergodex a lot, but it hasn't changed much from a UI perspective. I think Ilya mentioned charts were going into production next week, so that might be a good topic. I'll need to use it first though. As for future directions, I can imagine a few, but prefer to focus more on the present. So, roughly, pencil me in for a piece on Ergodex charts, when they are out. I'll spend some time and see what else I can come up with.

 TokenJay uses ErgoPay to do AgeUSD swaps. It is the only implementation allowing end users to directly interact with the bank. Additionally, it is cheaper to use than sigmausd.io - try it :)


[05/27/2022 9:44 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
dApps run servers in the background in any case, the assembler service runs on a server as well. To be honest I don't know why most dApps don't adopt the solution and focus only on web wallets.

 Oversight on my part. I was aware of Tokenjay (I saw your tweet about the large swap that was done), but I haven't used it myself yet. Also, I agree. I think ErgoPay is a better solution. I just think it is different, and it will take time to get the same kind of traction because so much thinking is framed by a Metamask, Uniswap paradigm.

 That's exactly what I think as well, and maybe there is the difficulty with the skillset - for web wallets and their connector, only web frontend devs are needed, for ErgoPay a backend dev must be involved. This can't be the problem regarding ErgoDex though, it seems they just don't care about mobile users.
I am working on an escrow service for TokenJay which I hope will serve as another example. Will let you know when it is available to test.

@cafebedouin you have a lot of experience with Paideia and ergopad, right? You interested in covering the topic on the white paper?

(re @sean_ergonaut : *@cafebedouin you have a lot of experience with Paideia and ergopad, right? You interested in covering the topic on the white paper?*) 
 
 I wrote the marketing sheet for Paideia. I can also say that the timeline for a minimally viable product for Paideia is 3-6 months. 

Do you want something similar for ErgoDAO? I've skimmed the white paper. The abstract could be used as a blog piece in a pinch, but I'd write a blog summary of the project differently. The white paper itself could probably use some work, e.g., it references Coordinape as a way to incentivize participation in the DAO and there's no explanation as to what that is or link for more information. I could work on the white paper too, but there's no obvious place to do a PR.

Let me know what you want, approximate word count and so forth, and I can see what I can put together.

 The usual sized blog post (1-2 pages, font size 11/12) will do. I suggest taking inspiration from what you would prefer to write about in regards to Paideia. Is that ok?

@cafebedouin Would you be interested and available to write a short update on the testing 5.0? You wrote the original aricle on AOT costing and JIT costing and it seems wise to have you do the follow up on it. I understand it but not to the degree you do with the article you wrote.

It would be in response to this tweet that Kusthi released. One page would be plenty. Is this something you have time for?

 The article I wrote dealt with the new procedure for cost accounting with node 5.0. But, is that the only upgrade with 5.0? I'd guess the five second block interval is to aid with testing and it gets adjusted to 2 min blocks for main net? What does testing entail? Presumably, kushti is using scorex. But, what is he doing?

@glasgowm Would you mind taking a look at this when you have a moment. I've removed most of the opinions and tried to make it more in line with the branding we usually publish. This is ErgoMinnow's article and I just want to make sure we haven't misquoted any of the technical aspects. Thanks!

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EKJru1HL0DsKxHFbki3qd6RN6LLCjgXTUXOfmm9EHdo/edit?usp=sharing

@AngieHar This should be ready in a few hours today after I do a final proofread. I'm also going to fix the quotes by embedding the links in the article.

And will be published on medium since there is a lot of biased opinion

@eilemust It seems that the English sources are changing frequently. I have to recopy the source texts to the txt. file for translation.


[07/20/2022 1:28 PM] Rongrong21#0000
Actually, I have copied the sources and check the translations twice. However, the name and contents of the source files are changing.

以太坊挖矿社区和GPU矿工：合并后来Ergo的理由

挖矿社区
Ergo平台
2022年7月19日


可挖矿区块链领域正在发生巨变
工作量证明加密货币挖矿格局即将发生巨变。今年晚些时候，以太坊已宣布将把以太坊网络从工作量证明（PoW）区块链过渡到权益证明（PoS）。长期以来，以太坊和比特币一直被认为是可挖矿区块链的主宰者，而以太坊与PoW的背离让许多全职和业余矿工都在寻找一个可以接管以太坊算力的网络。如果您是以太坊矿工且正在寻找一个网络来利用您的挖矿资源，这里有几个考虑Ergo的理由。

抗ASIC且对GPU友好
如果您是一名GPU矿工，您的硬件将在Ergo上运行得非常顺利。为维护Ergo网络而部署的共识机制被称为Autolykos v2，它是抗ASIC的。这意味着用于挖掘比特币的ASIC 电脑不能用于挖掘Ergo（ERG）。那些拥有游戏电脑和/或专用GPU挖矿设备的人可以轻松参与维护Ergo网络，同时获得挖矿奖励。此外，许多同时挖掘ETH和ERG的人经常报告说Autolykos v2共识机制在其GPU上的运行温度更低，从而减少了对硬件的磨损。

支持智能合约的Layer 1平台
Ergo平台代表着最新区块链技术当中部分最独特先进技术的巅峰。它不仅以比特币的UTXO设计为蓝本，同时兼具部署稳健而高效的智能合约的能力。这两个功能的结合意味着Ergo被标记为扩展UTXO区块链，这意味着它与Cardano网络共享相同的帐本模型。Ergo还具有使用西格玛协议、NIPoPoW（工作量证明之非交互式证明）、存储租赁费、可选隐私功能以及赋予矿工的治理权利/责任等特点。

治理、EIP27和子池
Ergo被设计成一个自适应区块链。任何调整区块链方面的提案都须由矿工和矿池投票——矿工对Ergo拥有重要的治理权。例如� <clipped message>

And also that the issue with the pair was resolved, it will be good support

@AngieHar I've left a bunch of comments for ErgoMinnow to adjust. Once that's finished, I'll get in and edit the changes. I think it needs less paragraphs and more white space on each page. I suggested bullet points for listing important details for each topic.

[08/02/2022 3:19 PM] TuloErgo#0000
I think I left off on approximately slide 30 ish. After the Night Owl slide IIRC. Also, I couldn’t figure out how to remove those 3 lines on some of the slides. Yeah I like that idea! That would be very comprehensive and thorough, I like it.

@AngieHar need to correct the grammar a bit now that that the names were removed. This sentence:

Needs to be:

"The recipient will repay this loan ($2500) within 12 months, starting in September."

@TuloErgo I've rewrittten the slides up slide 31 to have less text. I've also formatted the slides to remove the dashes I was talking about up.

If you could take a look at what I've done so far and complete what you wanted to add tonight, that would be great. If you could also look at the style I've implemented for the first 31 slides and try to match it for the rest of the document, that would be great. Thanks!


[08/02/2022 9:57 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@AngieHar After these additions, the presentation should be ready by tomorrow. Please let me know if you like the new format. It has been edited from the beginning until slide 31.

kushti: a round table on the state of defi

ErgoPad discussed the basis of launch pads, attracting capital for investment and management of funds through doa frameworks

Glasgow, discussed usability of defi and considerations for mass adoption

Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo 
Discussing improvements of the Djed protocol to make it less sensitive to oracle delays

Frostyausty from anetabtc: Exploring Aneta as a DeFi protocol with an overview of its operation, such as LISO, in addition to discussing anetaBTC's implications for dApps & users within Ergo's ecosystem. Alongside the introduction to anetaBTC the segment can also expand upon the progressions made since the protocol's launch, including any up & coming features within the next iteration.

Night Owl Casino: Finding out the end intention for the endeavour, and how the project makes use of Ergo's technology, such as oracle pools, stablecoins, and wallets. Furthermore, the interview should bring to surface the mechanics of the solution such as RNG.

Sakata about Zero-Knowledge Treasuries: Presenting the idea of a ZKT & collective spending, with its use cases, followed by a segment where a ZKT client & server is setup with a rundown of configuration options - as well as MultiSig & DistSigs.

By PA they mean Parallel Asset, see: https://fluxofficial.medium.com/flux-parallel-assets-deep-dive-the-secret-sauce-of-flux-defi-cb1d1e85aa7f


they will integrate Ergo into their wallet and protocol, so that the FLUX token will be available on Ergo as a regular Ergo token, allowing any holder of Ergo's FLUX token holder to swap it 1:1 for a native FLUX by using their wallet, the Zelcore wallet. Something like a one-way bridge.
In another words they will "wrap" FLUX on Ergo

I’m waiting for their draft as soon as possible, so we could work on it together And announce on Monday 8 aug

So about zelcore integration 

From what I understood, the integration will be divided in two steps:
1. Zelcore support, zelcore is their multi-asset and and multi-platform wallet, so we will have one more wallet option for the users (apparently very soon) and more exposure to other ecosystems.
2. Addition of ERG as a FLUX parallel asset, which is basically a bridge between FLUX and Ergo, FLUX token on Ergo network will worth the same of a native FLUX on FLUX network.

Duplicating explanation on parallel assets: https://fluxofficial.medium.com/flux-parallel-assets-deep-dive-the-secret-sauce-of-flux-defi-cb1d1e85aa7f

So I sent them our announcements and request more details
So we are going to announce around the 7th is September

@sean_ergonaut Hi Sean, hope you’re feeling alright 
What’s the status of that two requests?


[08/29/2022 1:28 PM] ErGonario#0000
Hey everyone! A quick question. Do I need to let someone check my tranlations or I can publish them straight away?

(re @ErGonario : *Hey everyone! A quick question. Do I need to let someone check my tranlations or I can publish them straight away?*) 
 
 Hi Luigi, what article are you referring to?


[08/29/2022 1:36 PM] ErGonario#0000
the blogposts on ergoplatform.org

yep


[08/29/2022 1:37 PM] AngieHar#0000
It’s not a problem you can go ahead 
Just let me know what articles was translated if possible, so I collect them in a spreadsheet

[08/29/2022 1:39 PM] AngieHar#0000
(re @ErGonario : *yes sure, no problem, you mean all of the them? even the old ones?*) 
 
 The best case is to collect all the publications that were translated and then see the traffic to these articles to get to know the readership in the specific language 
So yep, it’s better to have them all, but at least within the last 2-3 months

Forwarded from Ceilican: In this case, I suggest the following:

"The Djed Alliance will offer a prize pool consisting of a total of (1800 * N) DACAU (Djed Alliance Contribution Accounting Unit) tokens issued on the Ergo blockchain, where N is the number of teams whose work relates to Djed/SigmaUSD and is considered to be sufficiently substantital by the judges of the Hackathon.

The N teams will be ranked and the prize pool will be distributed to the teams in such a way that a team at a rank k will receive 20% more tokens than a team at rank (k+1). Judges may, at their discretion, assign more than one team to the same rank.

Additionally, all N teams will receive a Djed NFT issued on the Ergo Blockchain, and developers from all N teams will receive the "Djed Developer" role in the discord server of the Djed Alliance.

(re @sean_ergonaut : *@AngieHar Here is the draft for the Terminus Wallet (formerly Ergo Mobile Wallet). Do we know if the rebranding has been applied to the Android App store as well?

 It is only zenGate's release of the wallet that is named Terminus. No rebranding happened, EF needs to decide if they want to rebrand on all platforms or continue to try to get an officially named version on the App Store

[09/06/2022 9:34 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
a different name was needed because a wallet with an official name has to be uploaded by an EF Apple account

 Understood. Then for the purposes of this blog article, it's important to note that the wallet is still Ergo Mobile Wallet if there was no rebrand? That's a little confusing becuase the name on iOS App store is Terminus Wallet. How should I spin this news?


[09/06/2022 1:55 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I asked for a decision by EF how to proceed. maybe we should wait with the announcement until they discussed.

or that's what is under discussion right now?

(re @AngieHar : *can we shift the focus from it and just announce it since it works?

 Yes, but my only concern is causing confusion about Terminus Wallet if that’s it’s name, or whether it’s Ergo Mobile Wallet. At this point, the same wallet has two different names on two different app stores.

but in general it's still ergo mobile wallet until it officially changes the name

But the iOS store calls it Terminus Wallet now. That’s the confusion.

 We had to use zengate to push it to the ios store in terms of time efficiency.

Will take a little bit to get apple users accustom to that.

(re @TuloErgo : *Any updates from the review team regarding the presentation Angie? I think it might be a valuable asset for newcomers coming over with the merge taking place.*) 
 
 Yep, i added a few comments 
Overall it looks good
Sometimes it’s a lot of text, would be better to have more numbers, especially in the “dapp overview” section

So the preliminary aim of the presentation is for public use, mostly investors/ media organizations/ possible partners
So one of the official documents as a pitch deck 
So in this case we need to shorten it, something is good to turn into visuals to simply show the landscape 

it would be good to have it in an e-book format maybe


[09/12/2022 6:30 PM] TuloErgo#0000
Wonderful, thank you for the update! Would you like me to go and try to shorten it some more? Truthfully I’m not great with visuals but I’m happy to try to condense it some more :)

For now we need to have all the text ready and polished 
But some parts when you see it overloaded with text just saying

Hi everyone, I know you are swamped with Ergohack stuff and have lots on your plate. I just wanted to reach out to say I have written another article which I think will be a real treat. It's titled "The Benefits of Building on Top of the Ergo Blockchain." It also includes quotes from various reputable developers accross the community which I think is cool! I know I've already put out the presentation and the 4 part roadmap articles so no rush at all, just wanted to touch base and let you all know that I have some material in the wings that is completed :)

 @glasgowm just curious if you’ve had a chance to glance? I’m fairly confident that the info is correct but it’s nice to have another set of eyes confirm the technical components. Cheers!

@Armeanio @glasgowm I’m working on an article on EIP 37 and I had info on reference clients 4.0.1 and 4.0.101.  I just saw on twitter that we also have 4.0.103 now? Is there a spot where I can get the most recent info on which clients (and their details) are needed for pools and miners


[09/29/2022 9:50 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000

100 is normal with the HF
101 is auto-voting
102 is normal with earlier voting (this epoch)
103 is autovoting this epoch

 ok,  couple of questions:

1. what is HF? sorry...

2. I thought 101 was initially auto voting and that the scanning mechanism would trigger the hard fork is consensus was reached? 101 is flat voting for EIP37?

3. 102 is normal? what do you mean by normal?


[09/29/2022 10:10 PM] glasgowm#0000
1. hard fork
2. It is yeh, typo - meant autovoting.
3. Vote needs to be specified

(re @sean_ergonaut : *great! very helpful. so is 103 only specific to this epoch? What's the difference between 103 and 101?*) 
 
 With 101 they would've needed to wait til the next epoch for it to count


[09/29/2022 10:28 PM] glasgowm#0000
103 could vote straight away

This one should be updated as the vote and fork have occurred

(re @AngieHar : *Sean, is it ready for publishing?*) 
 
 As @seedubya mentioned, it needs to be updated since the fork happened. I’ll need to redo the article now because currently reads as instructions for the vote. I’ll set it up to be an article about the vote that just happened.


[10/05/2022 7:23 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000

[10/05/2022 7:27 PM] AngieHar#0000
i mean not a news right 
because it’s something in the middle 

maybe add a few paragraph separately and link to a blog?


[10/05/2022 7:27 PM] AngieHar#0000
few paragraph goe to news and one blog and linked between each other


[10/05/2022 7:28 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
It discusses how EIP37 has passed but also explains how it passed by the reference clients


[10/05/2022 7:28 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
I think it could be news or blog..


[10/05/2022 7:29 PM] AngieHar#0000
it’s just because we have two separate pages
when you google for news it’s one page and explaner in another page 
understand what i mean?


[10/05/2022 7:29 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
I see. Would like this to be the blog? And I can do a short article that is the news of this passing?


[10/05/2022 7:30 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
then we link the blog article inside the news announcement?

 yes, the text is better for blog 
and it would be better just to add two short paragraphs so they are just reflected on the website and we can link from news to blog

@TuloErgo Hey Mark,
there are two articles that we need to rewrite in accordance with updated guidelines. you can choose one of the topics, or if you’re interested you can update both 

1. What is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and How can it benefit you?
https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2022-03-15-what-is-a-dao-decentralized-autonomous-organization/

2. Centralized Exchange (CEX) vs Decentralized Exchange (DEX): What are Differences?
https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-07-06-cex-vs-dex-what-are-differences/


here you can find guidelines 👉https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yhTQrxorCg5x8SDPLZmC0tTva5J2Tbl0h-K20WxoXrk/edit#

Hi Angie, I just read through the guidelines and I'm happy to do both if you can give me until Thursday night 11:59pm EST. I do have a question that pertains to the articles. Am I essentially just updating the articles or am I completely re-writing them? If I am to re-write them, would you like me to include some of the information offered in those articles or have completely new material? Thanks!

 great to hear! 
thursday is totally fine 

you can take these articles and add the info where needed in accordance with guidelines, no need to write from the scratch, some content can be just copied since these articles are ergo production

would be good also to embed links from trustworthy sources ( meaning add them to the draft, and then we’ll see if we use them for reference)


[11/01/2022 10:14 PM] TuloErgo#0000
Perfect, sounds great. I'll get to work on them tomorrow and finish by Thursday night. Thanks for the clarification.

 I’m going to get the ErgoHack results started. If you’re up for researching more of the multi-sig for a one page article that offers a little more in-depth look at it, that would be great. I’m out of town for meetings and have a little less time to research it in the next couple of days. Thoughts?

1-2 pages max. Doesn’t need to be too long

So I got a crazy idea last night. Do you remember that presentation you made with my Ergo ecosystem documents? I remember @AngieHar was talking about it possibly being made into an e-book. Here’s my crazy idea. With Book.io absolutely exploding in the Cardano NFT ecosystem, I wonder if something like that could be minted by book.io. Would probably need the EFs help with this but I think it could bring an insane amount of exposure/funding to Ergo. What do you guys think? @AngieHar @sean_ergonaut @Armeanio @seedubya

 You mean to sell the ebook as NFT?


[11/18/2022 3:41 PM] TuloErgo#0000
Precisely.


[11/18/2022 3:45 PM] TuloErgo#0000
Depending on how you guys and the EF feels about that, the mint could also be free or very low. Just thought I’d throw my idea out there.


[11/18/2022 3:46 PM] TuloErgo#0000
I just think it could be a very good way for Ergo to get a ton of exposure and it would educate the Cardano community about Ergo.


[11/18/2022 3:59 PM] AngieHar#0000
My point here would be that this presentation/ ebook let’s say is not educational or doesn’t give any knowledges but mostly a presentation of the organization


[11/18/2022 4:13 PM] TuloErgo#0000
Gotcha. Maybe I could organize the documents in a way that book.io would accept. Not sure. I just think it’s an intriguing opportunity to get Ergo more exposure. Book.io has really taken off.

@AngieHar here is the draft for the annoucement of the winners. Can I get some clarification on who won which prizes? There are so many other prizes and it isn't clear in the google sheets document. 

Also, I need an overview of what ergonames was building. 

@glasgowm are you able to assist a little bit with this? Thanks!

Good afternoon @seedubya @AngieHar @sean_ergonaut . Here is the Ergonaut Handbook - Updated. I focused on the Ergo Ecosysten and wallet section as they were the most behind and out of date. Instead of re-inventing the wheel, I used a lot of information from the Dapp/Utility document I previously wrote. I left out quite a few Dapps that I do have information on because I didnt know how long or extensive the article should be. I'm happy to add more under the 'Ergo Ecosystem' part of the article. I condensed the information quite a bit in the spirit of being clear and concise. I am fairly awful at formatting and would love some help with that. https://docs.google.com/document/d/125MFiQ-h8Fq5GsrhnjQdwqDVKeBIOD5K4bMc97dXoKQ/edit?usp=sharing

[11/22/2022 1:26 AM] TuloErgo#0000
Okay I've made those updates. However, I cannot seem to figure out how to get a clear resolution image onto Google Docs. The picture I pasted is so blurry.


[11/22/2022 1:46 AM] TuloErgo#0000
Let me know if you’d like me to delve deeper into the tokenomics but I put in a paragraph about eip27.


[11/22/2022 4:24 AM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@AngieHar @TuloErgo I'll have several of Mark's articles proofread and ready for publication by tomorrow. Thanks!

 ergo always has some off chain code. in this case, a lot since it is a centralized approach. that runs on flux.
that it is broken is probably due to ergohack already a month ago and flux apps run for a month. you need to manually repay with correct keys etc for it to work another month

(re  : *<Glasgow> Not sure that's a thing in google slides - should have full editor writes. And sure feel free thanks*) 
 
 I'm almost halfway through. There is a lot! Amazing work! I've restructured a lot of the sentences for continuity, grammar, and word and structure variety. I'll keep at it until I've finished. In the meantime, I've added a few comments to be resolved. Any comments I've added are up to the slide 30 for the moment.


[11/29/2022 12:15 AM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@glasgowm Can I suggest that whoever addresses my comments that they no longer use possessive pronouns. I've corrected a lot of those to work with "Ergo" or "the blockchain" as the noun. There are a lot of sentences that say: we're, ours, we, etc. It is a stronger document without possessive pronouns. I'm changing them now as I go, but for comments that require the writer(s) to clarify or reword some sections, it would be best to make sure those pronouns don't get reintroduced accidentally. Thanks!


[11/29/2022 12:19 AM] sean_ergonaut#0000

the main info is in social media and news article


[11/30/2022 12:36 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
Because there isn’t too much info to report with an exchange listing

Forwarded from mewtoshi: The following was done about two weeks ago but I didn't post it:
- Both of my websites, satergo.com and ergonodes.net are now accessible over IPv6.

Ergonodes.net:
- Now has a logo and an icon, made by Nadi (author of Satergo's redesign)
- The chart legends have been made smaller, all versions fit in the list now
- Enlarged the historical version usage charts
- Improved dark theme of the charts page

Satergo:
- Some final small changes remain to finish the new design. Release soon.

I agree, I think any Ledger news will spread very quickly on it's own. I just want to make sure we're positioned and ready for the annoucement and not publishing something after it's already been circulating through social media channels. That way we keep traffic clicking on our links for articles on the website that are embedded in social media

Hi everyone. So I’m going on vacation to the Philippines next week and I’ll be gone for 6 weeks. However, I’d love to write some articles if there’s any that need written.

So psyched about this. 
I believe that this is the beginning of a big boost in commercial adoption that #Ergo really needs.

The #PalmyraComDex will utilize Ergo NFTs for tokenization of real world products.

Could you please add a short lead summarising the news right after the title? 

So the structure of the news always has to be as follows 

Title h1 
Lead ( a short paragraph, around 200-300 characters summarising the entire story) 
Main part 
Conclusion

Can you clarify what you mean about adding a section about the sigmanauts?

(re @sean_ergonaut : *@AngieHar?*) 
 
 Yes, I was about to text you 
The sogmanaut program is in progress now and I was about to publish a news/ or blog articles describing the sigmanaut program and their 2022 update, because they are working on a structure and as a case it’s very interesting to cover since it’s a birth of a new dao in ergo 
So I wanted to add some info as we speak about dao in the piece
However I think it’s better to have a separate piece on sigma stub program and if you have the aboity to briefly mention suanaut program in this article would be nice

Forwarded from ErgoBridgeBot: <Krasavice Blasen> duckpools updates 🦆 

Just a small update as I have been busy writing user guides for duckpools as well as talking with @Marty from ergopad about the launching of a duckpools token in early 2023.
A proper announcement will be made regarding these things soon, but rest assured, a token launch would not impede on the purity of our platform and would be free from artificial utility. 

As for recent dev-work:
- sigUsd pool contracts written and nearly ready for public beta testing
- Playing around with GraphQL to lower front-end loading times.

Also, I looked at ergo.watch this morning and I think the data there has a nice story to tell. I'd like to use the graphs there to quantify our growth over the past couple of years- perhaps I'll do that next.

(re @TIMRΣG7 : *Also, I looked at ergo.watch this morning and I think the data there has a nice story to tell. I'd like to use the graphs there to quantify our growth over the past couple of years- perhaps I'll do that next.*) 
 
 Are we able to compare it with Bitcoin or any other blockchains so to have a comparison analysis? This could raise awareness


[12/29/2022 8:30 PM] TIMRΣG7#0000
Yeah, that should be easy to do. I saw that we actually have more average daily transactions than Cardano had at 3 years old.


[12/29/2022 8:31 PM] TIMRΣG7#0000
We still look pretty small in comparison to other large chains, but you can see that most metrics are moving in the right direction and perhaps I can find things to compare it to effectively.


[12/29/2022 9:24 PM] cafebedouin#9837
It's an interesting question. I don't know what the data looks like or your time frame, but this is a perfect application for R and ggplot2. Be interesting to do day to day comparisons between BTC, ETH, Cardano and Ergo - if there is some place that keeps historical numbers for transactions, active wallets or whatever. I'll look into it.

Forwarded from kushti_ru: I think wrapped assets is a good idea helping to isolate risks. Overcollateralization is also good, if we are talking about building secure and resilient financial tools, and with transparency of on-chain operations we also can quickly obtain knowledge on what is going on in the system.

And in 2022 crypto, centralized offchain part of "crypto" failed (3AC, FTX / Alameda, DCG) among with protocols having centralized components (Serum) or not targeting resilience (Terra, USDN)

Hi all, can we please put together an article to make the community aware Yoroi is no longer going to be supporting Ergo (no time frame afaik, @Armeanio is it known when this is ending?).

We can link to our available wallets and explain the general process of restoring with a seed phrase in a different wallet, importance of keeping seed safe and if a seed is lost creating a new wallet and transferring funds from Yoroi to the new wallet.

We have a number of great wallets now and could have a couple of sentence description for example...
- nautilus being a web/browser wallet with dapp connector and displaying nfts etc.
- mobile wallets with ergo pay and mosaik integration, cod wallet support
- SAFEW having mixer integration 
- Satergo being full node and updated UI 
- minotaur with multisig support

Okay @AngieHar and @sean_ergonaut here is the Duckpools article. I’ve been in contact with their devs as they’re actually the same guys that help me with my NFT project. They allowed me early access to their white paper but don’t want it released to the public until it’s finished. I referenced some quotes in the article so maybe a disclaimer that the white paper isn’t public yet might be warranted.

(re @seedubya : *not sure who edited, registration will remain open throughout the entire hackathon. allowing anyone to join up until the conclusion of the hack*) 
 
 During the previous hackathon I got a lot of complains from teams that some other teams joined later and that it’s is not fair


[01/19/2023 1:12 PM] AngieHar#0000
Because it’s a challenge at first


[01/19/2023 1:13 PM] AngieHar#0000
And they should compete in equal conditions


[01/19/2023 1:16 PM] CW#0000
it will be announced registration is open throughout the hack, conditions known prior to joining


[01/19/2023 1:17 PM] AngieHar#0000
(re @seedubya : *it will be announced registration is open throughout the hack, conditions known prior to joining*) 
 
 It’s not about the announcement but the conditions and motivation for devs 
The main point when we allow to join whenever they can, other teams see that you never know your competitors


[01/19/2023 1:18 PM] AngieHar#0000
And also it’s hard to follow what was done during the hackathon 
At the same time teams can build apps all the time but then come to an end day and just submit saying that they built


[01/19/2023 1:19 PM] AngieHar#0000
And those who just started from the first day 
That’s the difference


[01/19/2023 1:20 PM] CW#0000
yeah, i understand that perspective. also dont want to restrict someone coming in and wanting to submit a proposal, not restrict anyone from joining

Hi @sean_ergonaut . I've made some changes that you suggested. Let me know if there is anything else you would like me to add. I left a comment on the document but I'll also mention it here in case it doesn't show up. The Duckpools team did not want me to release their whitepaper to the public until it is 100% completed. They gave me early access because I know them personally. Did we want to create a disclaimer stating that their whitepaper will be released shortly?

I thought I'd do this one as an overview of why privacy is important and on the next privacy article, i'd focus more on the technological aspects of it. Let me know if you think that's a good way forward 👍

Forwarded from ErgoBridgeBot: <mhs_sam> Rosen Bridge:
as @greenhat  said:" WIP spent some time digging into the custom wasm-bindgen/wasm-pack to enable weak ref TC39 support on CI, but luckily new version of wasm-bindgen came out with our fix, so it's ready for testing https://github.com/ergoplatform/sigma-rust/pull/682"

it's a good news for us; we're going to update the wasm but not for the public test.
- we're almost ready for the public test since the tests are completely done.
- however there are some errors and warnings in the logs, but it seems the bridge is working perfectly and these errors are not critical and will not affect the overall bridge's functionality. We're investigating these logs and will fix any remaining issues.
- we've done a mild stress test with 9 concurrent transfers and the bridge was successful in handling them. By the end of this week, we'll hopefully finish our final stress test with much more concurrent txns. 
- meanwhile, a few improvements and changes are under development, but these changes will not be available and necessary in the public test mode. 
- it seems the public test can begin very soon.

The new type of decentralized exchange we are designing will not be an order book. 

It will be ordered based... 

New DEX on Ergo will use grid order contracts, collectively these can replace liquidity pools. 

The goal here is decentralization and p2p trade.

Forwarded from ErgoBridgeBot: <mhs_sam> 🌉 Rosen bridge:

🧪 - Public Beta (test) Launch: it's pending a fix in sigma-rust but the process is already started. We'll be live soon.
- Put the system under a new stress test and checked the events status. Some new bugs found and fixed.
- Worked on standardizing of the test tools (especially jest in our case), discussing different best practices, conventions, etc.

🛡️ @rosen-bridge/ts-guard-service:
- Worked on finding the cause of invalidation of some events (when the events are not meant to get invalid).
- Worked on finding the cause of a wasm/prover error which causes our multi sig subsystem to time out. We are still working on it, as it's non-deterministic and cannot be reproduced easily.

🛠️ @rosen-bridge/utils:
- Introduced a new package inside our utils repository. The new package is meant to serve as a container for different functions and apis which are used inside other Rosen bridge packages.
- The first function we worked on was downloadRosenAssets. It can be used to programmatically download Rosen bridge assets (including tokenMap and all chains addresses files) instead of doing it manually. The function is mainly implemented to be used in our upcoming @rosen-bridge/cli package.

🧐 @rosen-bridge/watcher
- Re-tested our migrations in postgres and fixed some bugs.

⛓️ @rosen-chains/abstract-chain
- Every blockchain supported by guard-service in the bridge requires some actions which are defined in abstract classes and structures in this project.
- The classes are implemented. 
- The Development document which is a guide about how-to-add new chain is in progress.

🪙 Tokenomics

(re @sean_ergonaut : *@AngieHar can you confirm that no one else is writing about this before I write something?*) 
 
 A comparison of bridge design between rosen and a couple of other designs, maybe those that we're exploited, highlighting the differences would be a great article.


[03/08/2023 7:25 PM] CW#0000
Things like known assumptions, for example the known number and distributed nature of guard/watcher sets compared to harmony one exploit that was a 2 of 4 multisig or something (from memory) 

Convey that rosen isn't just 'another bridge'

As for bridges as a separate topic, would be great to spread releases within some period of time and publish near the launch date to bring it as a campaign ( instead of public press release)

@aer45958 Hey, the ERGO app is in full release, not in dev mode

If you do not see it in the apps catalog, then your Ledger setup might need an update, if so, please check out the order and tips mentioned here: https://t.co/MTyfVKFNJB

We hope this better clarifies and remain available! 🙏

Where are you seeing this? I dont think I have this option. I only have a 'paperclip' looking thing to send pictures with.


[03/28/2023 1:25 PM] AngieHar#0000
hmmm, maybe you have an outadet version of telegram, dk 
okay no worries, let me try your image and see how it looks on the website 

okay, could you please send others too?


[03/28/2023 1:26 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
I have something in the bottom right corner saying to update telegram so most likely. Ill do that shortly haha!

no problem 
sorry for chasing you for this 
but the problem is that we need to squeeze the format of the image in order any image looks okay on the website


[03/28/2023 1:29 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Not a problem at all Angie!

@TuloErgo Mark awesome, thanlks for the materials 

if you want to continue with texts, there is going to be a paideia update, somewhere in the beginning of april, would be great to suppoet them and publish a status update too


[03/28/2023 1:42 PM] AngieHar#0000
We expect to release MVP around April 👍

- creation of dao (duh!)
- staking
- profit sharing
- standard governance
- basic proposals
- following actions:
    - send funds from treasury to address
    - change dao config
- following values are configurable:
    - staking emission per staking period
    - staking period length
    - staking delay in number of periods (stakers will receive rewards first when this delay has passed)
    - profit share pct (how much goes to stakers and how much to treasury)
    - quorum threshold
    - majority threshold (should a vote only win if fe. 60% vote for it)
    - whitelisted proposal types
    - whitelisted action types
    - whitelisted tokens for profitsharing (so you dont end up with something like Comet)
    - update contracts for the different parts of paideia (a dao will decide for themselves if they want to upgrade when a new version of a contract is released)
    - any custom config the dao would like to use (they could refer to these configs in their own contracts for example)
- In paideia's dao the following configs are open for change through proposal:
    - dao creation fee (erg and or paideia)
    - proposal creation fee (ergo and/or paideia)
    - dao running fee (fee per staker per staking period)
    - upgraded default/template contracts for newly created dao's

        so Avalanche and Celer cBridge are open source. Celer was attacked via an altered website certificate which tricked users into accessing a phishing link

Can't find any details on hacks or lost funds with Avalanche


[04/03/2023 5:35 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
But Celer's bridge infrastuture wasn't attacked by the sounds of it


[04/03/2023 5:35 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
website certificates are different from an attack on the bridge if I'm not mistaken


[04/03/2023 5:35 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@glasgowm Could you weigh in here. Just to make sure I'm making sense


[04/03/2023 5:37 PM] glasgowm#0000
yeah that is correct


[04/03/2023 5:38 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@AngieHar I guess we could point out the success of a bridge? Avalanche bridges assets with Ethereum. It has not been hacked


[04/03/2023 5:39 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
> (re @glasgowm : *yeah that is correct*)
         
        Thanks! Last question. Does Avalanche Bridge use smart contracts on both sides? 

the lack of smart contracts on the bridged chain to Ergo through Rosen Bridge is what makes Rosen Bridge so innovative, correct?


[04/03/2023 5:43 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
@glasgowm I'm just not fully versed on whether other bridges have been constructed so that all of the smart contract work is done on one chain


[04/03/2023 5:45 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
This diagram seems to show smart contracts on both chains

Think Rosens main thing is simplicity / known assumptions. Rather than overcomplicating it. Might be quite similar to avax. MHS would be able to answer better

I think I found a solution for this article. The wardens in the ETH AVAX bridge are trusted entities. If they fail, they can be an attack vector.

@AngieHar I've added a section on Avalanche bridges. I'm not 100% certain on the technical content though. @glasgowm would you mind giving it a quick look? It's two short paragraphs under the header Avalanche Bridges.

@AngieHar Back to your comment about writing about Ergo's amazing developers. I actually wrote an article around 6 months to a year ago about Ergo's devs and why people should build on Ergo. I can't remember if I ever submitted it to you or @sean_ergonaut. I think it's a really good one and maybe I could continue it and include a few more developers? Could even split it into 2 articles. I went around the Ergo community and got quotes from each dev on why they build on Ergo.


[04/03/2023 9:28 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
It isn't dev centered but more Ergo centered.


[04/03/2023 9:29 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Could maybe have a dev centered one like you said, and then the one I wrote? What do you think?

yea

Please write some articles about dexygold so that regular people can understand it.


[04/07/2023 9:48 AM] Rongrong21#0000
Just like Rosen Bridge.


[04/07/2023 9:49 AM] Rongrong21#0000
Introduce the basic information about Dexygold and compare it  with similar solution pegged with Gold.

        Also, did Alexis or Theta reach out to you? They wanted to add some information to it.


[04/07/2023 5:18 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
Never heard from them. What do they want added?


[04/07/2023 5:19 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Grrr. Don't worry about it then. They said they were going to lol.


[04/07/2023 5:19 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
I'm not sure.


[04/07/2023 5:19 PM] sean_ergonaut#0000
It's already a long article at 3 pages...


[04/07/2023 5:19 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
Agreed.


[04/07/2023 5:19 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
I'd just go ahead with it.


[04/07/2023 5:21 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
P.S They told me the content was very strong in the article so I know their team is happy with it. Not sure what they want added but again if they didn't contact you then I think it's fine.


[04/07/2023 5:23 PM] AngieHar#0000
One more insight 
We usually put the article to promote in twitter 
And include just a link 
So it’s not good for algorithms 
So it’s better to make threads to support our articles, like a summary 

As Glasgow mentioned he tried chatgpt for that, or maybe there are other ways? 
I would like to start these from now on 
And make the schedule of the news more regular 
So that’s jfyi


[04/07/2023 5:24 PM] AngieHar#0000
A new schedule hurrray 🤩😁


[04/07/2023 5:25 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
So basically when the Ergo_Platform Twitter posts the published article, instead of just pasting the link they will take the entire article and put it as a Twitter thread?

@TuloErgo you free right now? there is a sentence where I'm not sure what it being said

Hi ErgoPOS Family.
To make our project more widely known and to integrate with other cryptocurrency chains, we plan to follow other projects by renaming our ErgoPOS to TabbyPOS, with a grey cat(tabby) as our logo. Therefore, we will be changing our website, Telegram, and Twitter logos to that of a grey cat(tabby). The Token still remain $EPOS. We apologize to any members of our community who may not be fond of cats, but we believe that this adorable tabby represents our project's friendly and dependable qualities.

Hey @glasgowm! I wonder if you could take a look at this doc for one thing. It’s about stablecoins. I thought SigUSD was classified as an over collateralized crypto backed stablecoin. As such, it wouldn’t be fair to say that it is a non-collateralized stablecoin, correct? I’ve highlighted the section that talks about that. I’m wondering if we need to change the category name from Non-collateralized stablecoins to something else.

Forwarded from ErgoBridgeBot: <mhs_sam> 🌉 Rosen bridge:

🧪 Public Beta Launch
We are going to launch the beta version of Rosen Bridge for all of the users from now!
it's available at: https://beta.rosen.tech
Currently we support Erg and Comet on Ergo and Ada and Hosky on Cardano.

🚀 @rosen-clients/*
Finished the implementation of all three client packages and published them to npm registry. The packages are all available publicly:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rosen-clients/ergo-node
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rosen-clients/ergo-explorer
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rosen-clients/cardano-koios
We encountered some issues related to the conversion of numbers to bigints in the apis and types. After some trial and error, we finally preferred to write our own codemod to change all of number types to bigints. The new fixed versions will be available soon on npm. We will also make the repositories public on GitHub in days.

🛡️ @rosen-bridge/ts-guard-service
EventProcessor module of guard almost refactored. Needs updates of  @rosen-chains to release which is in unit-test development stage. Also another update is needed in @rosen-bridge/tokens.

⚖️ @rosen-bridge/minimum-fee
A config, rsnRatioDivisor, updated in minimum-fee package, which was needed to support high decimal assets. This will be used in beta version.

⛓️ @rosen-chains
Most of Cardano chain implemented according to abstract classes. @rosen-chains updates are not yet applied to it.

Forwarded from unknown: Hi guys, is there an article that describes how to prevent rug-pull on ergo?

A Chinese community member reminded us of learning marketing experience from China Shandong Zibo, a small but the most popular tourism city in China due to its barbecue at present.

At rest time, I watched a lot of videos about zibo shaokao (barbecue) and found the truth why the city is so popular in China now. The truth is being honesty.

I think Ergo and its ecosystem projects here also feature this good quality, being honesty, no scams, no rug-pulls.

As we know, rug-pulls or scams often happened in the crypto space. Therefore, if there are some methods that prevent scams or rug-pulls, for example, refundable ico, code audit, locking the team's tokens using smart contracts or any other similar rug-pull resistance methods, I believe the crypto people will show more confidence in ergo and its ecosystem projects.


Most importantly, we should highlight this ability of rug-pull resistance by creating an article or picture that describes this ability.


[04/27/2023 6:25 PM] AngieHar#0000
@sean_ergonaut hi Sean, please let me know if you are able to take the last look at stablecoin article, the info was added and I aim to release it tomorrow

Hi Angie, did you have any further information for me on the UTXO article by chance?


[04/28/2023 7:31 AM] AngieHar#0000
Forwarded from unknown: I will request the editorial team to write an article about the rug-pull resistance mechanisms adopted by Ergo and its ecosystem projects like Paideia so that you create a picture based on that.

I know three rug-pull resistance mechanisms by translating many English articles and tweets into Chinese. They are locking the team's tokens using smart contracts for a long period such as two years, refundable ICO and code audit. If there are more similar mechanisms, you guys here can share them with us.

Is this a real thing? Smart contact non re hypothecatable 130% over collateralized loan at 42% 18 month payment.  Seems to good to be true. Presumably borrower defaults perfectly correlated to ERG price so I get it it but jeez.  I don't know shit about crypo but follower sent me…

@AngieHar Hey Angie! Do you by chance have the structure I am supposed to use for the Rosen Bridge PR? Could work on it today :)


[05/01/2023 9:28 AM] AngieHar#0000
@TuloErgo hey Mark 
So the structure: headline, a lead paragraph, second and third paragraphs, and a final paragraph containing background information.

Lead paragraph should contain all primary info, reflect all aspects of our news 

350-500 words 

final paragraph of a press release provides contact information (including social media accounts)

But prior we’ll need to edit this one


[05/01/2023 3:20 PM] AngieHar#0000
So the first part of the text is about the news 
And the second part is general info about ergo, this can be taken from our former PRs, so focus on the first part and would be good to have it as soon as possible
