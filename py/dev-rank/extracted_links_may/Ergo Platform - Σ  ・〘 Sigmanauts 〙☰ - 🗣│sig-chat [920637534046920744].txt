@pluto i noticed that you wrote something about wanting to tackle the question of 'why ergo' - there is currently a need to try to figure out the best way to present ergo to people as their first impression. as many here will already know, the nuances and depths of what ergo has to offer are not necessarily the easiest things to 'sell' or to grab peoples attention. Would you be interested in a bit of a brainstorm to try to see if we can move towards this goal of a really perfect summary of ergo to capture new peoples attention? I'm thinking, a short 'title' (optional) and then something like 50 words or less. all other @Sigmanauts please feel free to throw ideas in, we need a mass brainstorm because this I no easy task.

I have been trying to figure this out for a while. I mainly do it by sending people to sigmaverse.io but that‚Äôs still not the best intro


[12/24/2021 2:10 AM] timreg7#6732
It is a tough question. Here was my recent response 

3 Reasons: 

1. The project's values are similar to my own. 

2. They are seeking to advance PoW & eUTxO, rather than face unknown risk w/ PoS. 

3. Their mcap is quite small, while the tech operates as good or better than many large projects. Lots of room to grow.

I think the thing to focus in might be - what can ergo do that other blockchains cant, or cant do as easily, and what value does that provide to the users of the blockchain. The only problem with this is that it can lead to fud because a lot of Ergo‚Äôs exotic tech isnt fully realized yet.

I'm currently working on my thesis on conducting a sentiment analysis and possible prediction on cryptocurrencies, via opinion mining. (working in python, not a dev just an enthusiast).

I wrote some notes a while back about off-chain bots but I an not sure how accurate I am about it. I can post the pdf or md file if anyone is interested to read it and see if it is worth putting somewhere. It probably needs a rewrite and if anyone is interested and what to use my notes feel free to do so

I've rejigged the ergonaut.space nav bar a bit - try and make it a bit more accessible and move the more technical stuff to ergodocs (ergonaut.space is more an ELI5). Think @cafebedouin is going to simplify the home page ‚ù§Ô∏è

[12/31/2021 10:11 PM] cafebedouin#9837
This is right up my alley. In a past life, I was a librarian. We need a browseable folder structure in the side bar, a main index page that gives you the elevator speech of what Ergo is and why someone should care. Below that some linking to drop people into the main types of information they care about. Probably be good to have a Glossary folder and some kind of site index. Let me take a deeper look at what is here and see if I can get some kind of initial organization going.

[12/31/2021 11:45 PM] cafebedouin#9837
So, messed with the nav bar a lot. I'd guess I might have broken some links coming into it from elsewhere. Kept some pages on the root page to smooth that transition, if this organization is what you want. Couple of points I would make:


[12/31/2021 11:47 PM] cafebedouin#9837
1. Agora seems like a discussion element to the Manual. It makes more sense to me that this might serve as a reference for some of the discussion. But, you have a discussion forum at ergoforum.org. It makes sense that a discussion would happen in a discussion forum, and maybe use the Handbook as a discussion starter and then move any consensus ideas into the Handbook as they develop.


[12/31/2021 11:49 PM] cafebedouin#9837
2. Glossary is to put all the stuff that you reference and then can link to a canonical definition, so you don't have to do it all the time. Write a good definition of Schnorr Proofs, and just link to it every time you need to discuss it. I'd also break them into as small of pieces of information as you can make it. For example, I turned Building Ergo into Oracles, Atomic Swaps and Storage Rent.


[12/31/2021 11:52 PM] cafebedouin#9837
3. I'd keep the overview page and the Ergo Manifesto as the only two pages in the root directory. I can see moving some important things from Guides into a folder on the root level, such as Mining. I don't have strong feelings about it, but parked it in Guides for now.


[12/31/2021 11:55 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Anyway, it's a start. I'm thinking the Wikipedia main page might be a good model, brief description, links to key documents, maybe one of those documents being a What is Ergo, at three levels: general (at the start), crypto enthusiast, and developer levels as options.


[12/31/2021 11:55 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Anyway, enough damage for one day.


[01/01/2022 2:08 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Alright, today did an initial version of the front page. Four sections could be filled out more: 1) how-to guides to getting something done with Ergo or some kind of link to tutorials, 2) defining cryptocurrency jargon in the Glossary section, 3) describing various dapps (might just want to link to the sigmaverse), 4) descriptions of various communities, for example, something I'm not clear on is what are the different functions of Telegram vs. Discord


[01/01/2022 2:24 PM] glasgowm#9381
Wow this all looks great. Will have a proper look when I'm not dying ü§¢

Discord and telegram have the same function but some people find discord like a labyrinth. Suggestions on organisation here also appreciated but for some they don't/can't use discord in general.

Im a bit late but I want to say something about this.

What you said has been in my mind for a while, it is not a rare thing to see someone new joining the spanish chat and asking "why is ergo a good project" and then either @JOFLITO or myself reply with  a bunch of links that explain some things of Ergo (in spanish, although there were not many since it takes a while to translate them all and there are a lot although I ve got a good chunk translated on the main website) or either redirect them to the ergonaut space where they would basically get lost or either write some technical stuff manually instead of sending links.

Since I am still a normie and "new" to crypto, I know for a fact **what** and **how** people want to read/hear why is a project worth it. 
So I decided to create a post that sums everything up in the easiest way possible and writing there exactly what the newcomer wants to read to keep their interest.

https://medium.com/@ergoplatformes/7e72d49b8f40

So with this link we (in the spanish chat) can simply send it to the newcomers and I think it wins us time(no writing) and gets their attention

[01/01/2022 9:16 PM] Daniumy#5792
I think Andy asked for something shorter to catch their attention, like highlighting the most interesting things in a few sentences, but anyways I think the post could be also helpful.

[01/01/2022 11:01 PM] Daniumy#5792
Maybe something like that could be done in english, some sort of "Ergo explanation for the common person"


[01/01/2022 11:03 PM] Daniumy#5792
Every new user would click on it, a project is mostly boosted by the low-profile investors, even tho someone with 1 million dollars would read every document of Ergo before investing them, the dude with 100$ wants a quick summary of what ergo is, sometimes not even that and they just trust what somebody else said üòÖ


[01/02/2022 12:07 AM] NoahErgo#4349
I feel like maybe lets wait and see what the new website redesign brings, i know that is something they are hoping to tackle


[01/02/2022 9:16 AM] JŒµnniŒµ D#1687
I had in mind and kind of started a series of articles on Ergo "by normies for normies". My main problem is time. A part of that problem is also that in order to explain something simply you have to first understand it thoroughly. I have spoken to @Affable Villain who, I think, is currently working on one such piece.

Like @Daniumy though my experience with that kind of new member looking into ergo is that they aren't too interested in understanding e.g. eUTXO thoroughly, but more have a dictionary definition of it (an undarstandable one). So the glossary @cafebedouin mentioned imay do far more work/cover more ground than it might seem.

The questions to answer are mainly 1. what is it 2. what does it do 3. why is this better. For the second kind of question ("how do I"s mainly) LadoPixel's ergotutorials have been a godsend. 
A lot of ppl coming in just want to push the button that does the thing and just want to know why this button (so to speak) and what it does is better.

[01/03/2022 1:11 AM] NoahErgo#4349
I was wondering about this, if there is value locked in sigusd and then that sigusd gets locked into LP, does that get doubled up under a TVL figure?


[01/03/2022 1:11 AM] NoahErgo#4349
How is it accounted for?


[01/03/2022 9:37 AM] Gazza_SP#5835
SigUSD and ErgoDEX TVL are seperate at the moment


[01/03/2022 9:37 AM] Gazza_SP#5835
The TVL on the DEX is only related to tokens on the DEX!


[01/03/2022 9:38 AM] Gazza_SP#5835
sigUSD has a way higher TVL, 10m compared to 1.5m I think


[01/03/2022 4:06 PM] NoahErgo#4349
Right but if there is sigusd in LP, does that TVL get doubled up because it counts for both sigusd dapp and ergodex LP?

Nope since they are both locked in seperate smart contracts! Here is the DEX smart contract address that shows all tokens available, it adds up to give you the TVL!

Personally I think of the @ergoplatformorg changes the monetary policy it has to be a hard fork and it should not remove rewards to be put into a contract.

[01/03/2022 5:10 PM] glasgowm#9381
:/


[01/03/2022 5:42 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
It doesn't even make sense, why go down the hardfork route when it's not necessary, so miners can stay on the old chain to get more rewards for a chain that won't be developed on? Also miners are the ones deciding the vote, it's only a proposal üôÑ


[01/03/2022 9:16 PM] andee#4722
That tweet makes no sense


[01/03/2022 9:22 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
I think there are TOO many opinions at this point.  (Which is yet another opinion lol)  

Its getting a little messy but I think there should be some anticipation for that. 
 Agree it's only a proposal and many are treating it as set in stone, however, I think a bigger issue providing a fair way for miners to vote.  For example if all pools are for the soft fork how does a miner vote no?  Sure they can just pull all their hashpower off of Ergo, but that doesnt help anyone.  We are planning to solve that......However, the question is how many miners will take the time to even bother to change their rigs to another pool.  Im sure there will be some complacency that comes into play.


[01/03/2022 9:27 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
I'm already on your pool but I get ya, people are slow to change, in almost everything to be honest üòÖ


[01/03/2022 9:31 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Yep human nature at its best.  The biggest hurdle for us or any smaller pool is getting miners to stop looking at reward from a short term standpoint (sound familiar) Yes on Hero and Nano they find alot of blocks so payouts are more consistent.  Where as smaller pools are typically playing the high/low game from a day-to-day perspective based on pool luck.  Where in reality, it should all balance out.


[01/03/2022 9:40 PM] glasgowm#9381
Presumably one would've sprung up if there was demand. As long as there's that option I don't see any issue. We can't solve every complanacy (yet).


[01/03/2022 9:51 PM] Gazza_SP#5835
I get just as much payouts on your pool than I did on woolypooly which has a decent chunk of hashrate

Hello all! I'm very happy to be here. I thought I'd give a quick intro ‚ù§Ô∏è

I'm a student from South Africa studying in Hong Kong. I run a stake pool on Cardano but recently my heart has become more of an Ergonaut. 

I've picked up ERG mining and am one of the Adaverse YT/Twitter members. I try to create videos about topics like mining, SigmaUSD, Ergo Auction House etc.

If I can be of use to anyone, whether it be giving access to a Cardano relay or creating a YT video about ERG content, feel free to @ me. It seems like a lot of the core team are busy 24/7 so pls lmk if I can help out with anything.

Happy 2022 everyone!

[01/07/2022 5:22 PM] Donalddd#2998
Yeah


[01/07/2022 5:23 PM] Donalddd#2998
They agreed that they don't really know the pros and cons and they expect Kushti to give a bit more insight about why he thinks it is necessary and what was his thought process for this proposal. There was fear about hashrate leaving Ergo.


[01/07/2022 5:24 PM] timreg7#6732
I'd say it should leave now before we have significant defi operations


[01/07/2022 5:25 PM] Donalddd#2998
There also some alternative ideas and discussions about what else miners (or people with nodes) can do such as yield farming and other operations such as bots that might bring more income


[01/07/2022 5:28 PM] timreg7#6732
Yes, we need to be running dex bots and have access to profit sharing dapps to make up for it. But we will take a hit on hashrate no matter what. I think we need to extend emissions somehow and might as well rip the band-aid off before there is a lot at stake


[01/07/2022 5:33 PM] Donalddd#2998
To be honest I can't really predict what will happen, probably even people like Kushti can't predict. I think in the end the impact will be minimal. Compared to more drastic events such as halving, in coins other than Bitcoin there are no immediate effects. But it adds some time for the ecosystem to develop. The problem is price falling even without changing anything. It makes sense for people to sell especially if they had huge gains throughout the year but not much new interest around. I think if Ergo manages to become interoperable soon with Cardano and Ethereum, it will be huge.


[01/07/2022 5:37 PM] timreg7#6732
I think people sold the tops and the current emmission keeps price down. Interoperability and reduced emmission will help dramatically


[01/07/2022 5:37 PM] timreg7#6732
And sigmaverse.io is literally exploding rn haha

[01/07/2022 6:51 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
I agree with Glasgow. Pros far outweigh the Cons.

Seems like the miners are upset about taking a hit on their profits but lack very little vision beyond that.

even down to how the extension of the emissions schedule would opening up the possibility for people around the globe to make a passive income off stabilizing the ecosystem with household hardware for decades. 

Opportunities to change the world come seldom, but this is beyond individual interests.

its hard to separate the Ego from Ergo but approaching the conversation from a unbiased perspective is the start.


[01/07/2022 11:53 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Cutting 12 Erg from the block rewards isn't going to be minimal. If you figure a block every 128 seconds, with 86400 seconds in a day, that's about 8,100 less per day until it hits 15, and then a taper. But, this is basic economics, there's going to be constrained supply from liquidity pools and profit-sharing already. Add in more activity in the ecosystem because of cross-chain integration and just more functionality from dApps, that's an increase of demand and a decrease in supply. That results in price increases. If the timing is right, supply will reduce as the price increases, and the effect will be minimal. If it isn't right, well, might be a bit more messy, but it's worth it as an insurance policy on the long term viability of the chain. My bet is that it'll survive either way, but as it stands, it might not. Better to make the emissions change and be certain.

That‚Äôs not how this works.  I think we all know why ergo is at this price point.  Just look at liquidity. Increasing emission timeframe has nothing to do with fixing the price.  As many have said before, and I will say it here, @kushti  needs to explain to the community why this is being proposed.  In laymen terms (or have EF say it for him). Without a clear explanation, FUD kicks in.


[01/08/2022 6:18 AM] timreg7#6732
I don't think we're in disagreement here; the purpose of the emission reduction isn't to increase the price but to secure the network and extend the life of the project. However, as @cafebedouin pointed out, reducing the supply in an expanding ecosystem will likely have an effect on the price. I feel like kushti has already explained the purpose of this, and he did it previously when he proposed modifying the storage rent. I thought that was a less dramatic change but people voted no ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[01/08/2022 8:13 AM] Donalddd#2998
I don't think it will have any effect on the price. Other PoW have been having halvings, which is much more drastic than the SF, and  most of the times it never really affected the price. Only Bitcoin is an exception.


[01/08/2022 9:58 AM] KuantumWinter#1976

[01/16/2022 4:36 PM] Donalddd#2998
imo twitter and blog posts are keeping most of people up to the latest news. Also Armeanio is doing weekly update videos.


[01/16/2022 4:37 PM] Donalddd#2998
I think in general we don't lack broadcasting of news, but maybe we lack approaching people that don't even know about Ergo. I think this will be solved eventually with ErgoDex and interoperability. anetaBTC is an example of how a project in Ergo makes people from other networks recognize Ergo


[01/16/2022 4:54 PM] Œ£otiris#3516
Though another channel that would be specific to people wanting to learn news wouldn't be bad. We already have a stream of news as you correctly mentioned but what I know about marketing is there is no "enough". Could use these news with some customization in more channels. You have to be flexible and work on a variety of channels to increase engagement. Going into a cookieless world and everyone should prepare. Creating lists of audiences ( of course with their permission ) is never a bad idea and one should start asap. This is my humble opinion by working as a digital marketing specialist.

That's nice but why not send news by email too, with a signup form on site and by adding it to the linktree like @glasgowm suggested. It would be a nice opportunity to create lists that would be useful if the foundation wanted to create paid marketing campaigns in the future for example.


[01/18/2022 5:12 PM] root7Z#8699
I thought if e-mail list would be useful but then I felt that seems against pseudo-anonym open nature of cryptos so I didn't propose. @AngieHar @glasgowm what do you think


[01/18/2022 5:59 PM] Œ£otiris#3516
Well the form would require only the address, no other personal detail. Also this doesn't mean someone owns anything nor does it connect them with wallet addresses of course. Imo it'd be fine, but would be nice to hear other perspectives.


[01/19/2022 8:17 AM] Donalddd#2998
Personally I hate when I receive any kind of newsletter emails and I have never opened a newsletter this way. Maybe we could gain traction from older people joining crypto now, but I doubt we can gain any interest by email spamming. During the past month, how many newsletter have you opened that came through your emails?


[01/19/2022 8:18 AM] Donalddd#2998
For me the only ones I open are from twitter and linkedin because they have summed up information about posts that I would like to see (from Alex, Ergo and other crypto)


[01/19/2022 8:20 AM] Donalddd#2998
I believe that if a person is willing to give his email in a website, he is more likely to follow medium, blogs, discord/telegram or twitter to begin with


[01/19/2022 8:21 AM] Donalddd#2998
plus the crypto related emails that I receive are 99% scum... and people avoid them like the plague


[01/19/2022 9:06 AM] Œ£otiris#3516
How do you receive emails? Did you subscribe?
If yes why, given that you don't want them?
If not, this is a true problem but irrelevant as any platform shouldn't contact people without their consent.
Also there's always an unsubscribe button. 
To sum it up, Email marketing isn't by any means old fashioned, it is used a lot for spamming though as it can be personalized and it is really cheap or even free. 
If used in the right way, it can help boost engagement and it also provide useful analytics like any other medium.

Would be nice to build a weekly email newsletter with a summary of the most significant updates.

[01/23/2022 2:48 PM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
Significant updates on what scale? Community, development, summary of news posts with links..? 

I think it'd be cool to either do a community spotlight with short newsletter summarizing a project or individual, or weekly summary of top social media posts Twitter, Reddit, etc. 

Easiest would just be repasting the weekly dev updates, but I don't think that's a very clever idea. Idk.


[01/23/2022 2:50 PM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
something that is easily automated would probably be best, or no?


[01/23/2022 3:04 PM] Œ£otiris#3516
Imo it should be focused on getting updates to the community in a way that it is understandable. Summaries with links to posts/news etc. where someone will be be able to dig deeper if he wants. The most significant would be the ones that are showing the progress that is being made and are also  hyped in social media, like the recent ones that show the power of eUTXO with anetabtc. Also it would be interesting to send news with individual projects but this should start from something and evolve, so a community focused  summary would be great to begin with.


[01/23/2022 3:39 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Who is the audience for the newsletter? There's Reddit, YouTube, Discord, Telegram, Ergoforum, etc. At some point, someone needs to think about the various media and who the audience is for that media. I have over a few RSS feeds and subscribe to probably a couple of dozen newsletters. I try to avoid newsletters, but for some types of information, it's the only format the information is available in. And, just as you have to do audience segmentation for television, TV, print ads, and so forth, you probably need to break down various Internet channels into its audience and use the strengths of that medium to effectively communicate. For people on Discord, it probably makes no sense to have newsletter, but then again, people on Discord are probably the Ergo faithful. You're going to talk to them differently anyway. So, it might make sense to come up with some kind of media plan to think more strategically about these different channels of communication and what we want to accomplish with each. Some of that also has to factor in whose doing the work. Armeanio on YouTube is a completely different vibe than Glascow on the socials. They are going to appeal in different ways to different people. A newsletter might make perfect sense, but I think the first step here is to think a little harder about all the different communications that are already in play and think about what is missing and how you can use what exists more effectively.


[01/23/2022 3:54 PM] Œ£otiris#3516
The audience would be community members and it will be a weekly wrap up. Some people that wanna catch up on news and updates will find it convenient to have it in email, so there's the audience. Also I understand your view on this and I believe it will be complementary to all the existing efforts. This is like an evolving organism, why exclude a medium ? The information is there , also I strongly agree with you that  a media plan should be built, to have all channels work together towards growth üòâ


[01/23/2022 3:55 PM] cafebedouin#9837
One other point, frequency. Let's imagine different frequencies. What would a daily newsletter look like? What would a quarterly one look like? Most of Ergo's communication strategy is on the weekly. A quarterly newsletter that highlights everything that happened over the last quarter, might be great to help people remember (or get up to speed on) all the development that is happening.

[01/23/2022 3:57 PM] cafebedouin#9837
It's one vision, and possibly a very good one. I've just suggested another, a quarterly wrap-up. There are even more ideas out there, and perhaps some brainstorming about them and their comparative advantages and disadvantages would be useful.


[01/23/2022 3:57 PM] cafebedouin#9837
On the other hand, let the singer choose the song. The person doing the work could just decide what they want to do, because doing something you don't want to do is a job.


[01/23/2022 4:00 PM] Œ£otiris#3516
I agree with you, also a monthly or quarterly wrap-up would be great. This whole idea is about brainstorming and sharing ideas. Something nice might come out  üòâ


[01/23/2022 4:03 PM] cafebedouin#9837
On my end, I'm thinking quarterly because that's something I might be willing to do. Weekly? That's going to be someone else, although I could be talked into contributing every now and again.


[01/23/2022 4:09 PM] Œ£otiris#3516
I would also like to contribute in any capacity, if needed.


[01/26/2022 1:14 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah I think a quarterly one would be great. We're putting **a lot** of stuff out weekly now but it's easy to loose track.

Just more in general - a lot on the list are inactive - needing to get them taken off. 

More replacing of the ugly links - need to look into IFTTT scripting as you must be able to regex it or something.

honestly it's 50% just making sure that the Modque is being attended to so that posts are being approved/directed to the correct place, 40% trying to reel in automod from removing harmless activity, and 10% trying to help answer questions.

Hey SigCans! If you're a writer, I'm looking for help with Twitter posts on the ErgoPlatformOrg account. This could be a stepping stone to becoming a Sigmanaut!

I plan to create weekly Twitter threads on everything Ergo called Deciphering Ergo. 

They're a series of threads designed to be read as an eli1, simplify a topic or feature. No techy buzz words, simple explanations and real-life examples of use cases. The aim is to reach the everyday person.

We have a treasure trove of information in the existing articles/blogs. It's a matter of simplifying, with examples, to the point everyday people can read and comprehend.

Please assign your name to a topic here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wDDoeNAvE3U6mzXKmX2EAGcdeSdfwKNlwD2pDe0YBSs/edit?usp=drivesdk

Hey all, ‚ù§Ô∏è the Ergo community. I‚Äôve spent a lot of my free time this past year learning more about blockchain technology and interacting with both the Ergo and Cardano ecosystems as a user and developer.  I am currently focused on improving my functional programming chops(emurgo Haskell course) as well as launching a fun experimental environment(Ergrow). Background in fintech industry as solutions architect/engineer doing backend automation, data and analytics‚Ä¶ also run a farm/flower shop üôÇ 

Still trying to figure out how and where I can contribute ‚ù§Ô∏è

I made quite a few changes to the "First Steps" Sigmanaut Onboarding notion page. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to do this. I don't want to overstep, but I can continue to do this moving forward as I progress through the training (and go back and work on the introduction page, too).

Hey everyone, we had started this Ergo NFT Discord Server last August. ~350 members. 

I'm wondering if anyone wants to help moderate and do something with it? The original crew's intention was to just provide a spot for people to come and post their project and stay pretty hands off. I'm sure someone wanting to make it into something greater that the potential is there.

We noticed some spam links to a fake Github today (which we deleted and banned that person). @glasgowm do you have a Discord bot you recommend for things like that?

Down for any ideas! Otherwise, I'm wondering if there's another Ergo NFT Discord Server that people more commonly use that we could direct this community to?

tagging some NFT people for insight: @Foeniculum @HazeyOneKenobi

Perhaps if there's a better server that's more active we could guide people that way. I just don't want it to look bad on the community if it isn't well managed, but if someone has ideas to start being more active with it I'm all for that as well.


[05/20/2022 11:24 PM] crandano#8951
--
Currently leaning towards creating an Announcements channel and letting people know that the server will be closing by end of the month - while creating a channel for teams to post links to their project's server or favorite NFT server.

I noticed maybe only 4-5 teams posting updates to their projects. Again, I just don't want it to reflect badly on the community at large if people are directed there for NFTs.


[05/21/2022 12:17 AM] glasgowm#9381
Wick for spam, but if you add the bridge bot I can bridge the channels to this discord and make them opt in

[05/21/2022 4:09 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
I'd be happy to chat and see where I can assist with this. I have been getting more involved with the NFT community the past few months and would love to help promote these amazing artists and bring more attention to their projects, both within the community and the larger NFT audience.

Hey, thanks for the reply! I think there's a lot that could be done with it - it isn't that active these days, but plenty of people and projects still on there. The server owner should be back in the next few days and I'll have him make you an Admin and you can definitely feel free to run with it.

@Bryce 

Not sure if this document is hosted online somewhere & ergonaut.space just has broken link, or what. But pretty certain this Guerilla Marketing (by @PeppersCK on telegram) is what is meant to be accessed through ergonaut.space.

Can we make this ergo auction house discord group ?


[05/25/2022 7:58 AM] crandano#8951
i'm down to entertain any idea! the server owner is back and i'll make sure @Sisyphuspush is modded on there by end of tomorrow (and whoever else would like to)

Auction House is anon's baby i'm pretty sure so there would need to be a discussion with them. any thoughts @glasgowm ?

it's prime right now as a setup for people to come in, have their own channel, post links to their work + personal servers etc

if people wanted to start pushing it and being more active i'm sure it could do well

[05/25/2022 11:51 AM] glasgowm#9381
Having it just for the AH is a bit restrictive considering how it's built/setup; can have a dedicated category here in the ergo discord which bridges the active nft channels we have currently over there and points people to join the server for more


[05/25/2022 12:12 PM] crom#0000
Awesome, sounds like a plan


[05/25/2022 1:52 PM] Rishabh#7490

[06/09/2022 3:29 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
@Chris Ray Been working on the ErgoNFT Discord channel when I have time. Got most of the collections up to date with description, social & SH links, and mint addresses. Added "verified icon" to SH verified collections. Have been reaching out to artists to get them to post updates on their channels and share server invite with their supporters. Added Artists channel to allow creators to collaborate.

I like the idea of consolidating all of these efforts. Was just thinking about a monthly newsletter as I was reading @T U L O (ErgoMinnow) last article.

Hey all. As some of you know I have been working in the NFT space to help out with Discord and such. Been working on a simple website as well to act as a portal for Ergo NFTs. It's my 1st time building a website so its pretty simple. Thought I'd share some of progress I'm making.

Thanks, bro! Glad you like it. As you may have noticed, I plan on doing reviews of projects as well. If you ever fancy doing a writeup on a project, I'd happily include it once its up and running!

[07/09/2022 7:08 PM] crandano#8951
awesome! you've brought a ton of attention to the Discord as well. hamdergler has that ergonft site he'd give to you i believe (and i think he has some other ergo websites locked down)


[07/10/2022 12:06 AM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Yeah, I remember him mentioning that. This was more of a curiosity and learning experience...figured even if it isnt much as far as bells and whistles, it'll be something dedicated on the web. Then I can take what I've learned and work on sprucing it up more. Working on it did bring up some other things to work on as well that I shared with the SH team...mainly categorization of projects by both utility and by art style. Something to help users search for projects more efficiently.

Hi sigcans I have a goal that we could benefit from working on together. I really want to see Koinly integrate Ergo wallets and Ergo tokens natively in their platform. Have asked in numerous places, they have said the only way to get noticed is to more activity on the proposal I made. I have tried to share this message as best I can but if you guys could also spread the word around it would help massively.

Proposal is here: https://feedback.koinly.io/integrations/p/integrate-ergo-native-tokens

It's quick to make an account or you can use a google account if you have that. From what I can tell you can make multiple accounts to vote if you really want to

[07/16/2022 8:47 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Something I have been meaning to write is an article about trust and assumptions when using crypto. If you are using a dapp what are your assumptions when interacting with it? Same with a wallet. If its closed source do you assume that they will give it back? If you ise an exchange what are your assumptions? If you interact with a smart contract what are your assumptions? Do you assume that it will function correctly? Has it been tested? Will it burn your tokens? 

We make a lot of trust assumptions without even realizing it sometimes, especially if we are comfortable with the ecosystem


[07/16/2022 11:33 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Thats a great topic choice no doubt! im kinda leaning towards something more Ergo focused though.


[07/17/2022 12:13 AM] NoahErgo#0000

 I thought kushti or the ergo foundation was working on a know your assumptions (KYA) document? but even if so, more coverage of this the subject the better IMO.

I'd love to be able to permanently highlight  a KYA document on both r/ergonauts & r/ErgoTrading!

(re  : *<Rishabh> In this video i have used Music NFT as background music which was given by Cybercitizens, tell me in the comment section how was that*) 
 
 Hey, it's very cool that you made the video and used music from a nft, but I would have preferred a mix in which your voice is louder and the music is a bit softer (I watched it on my phone via speaker). Btw your voice is great.

Another thing is that you could have used the empty space on the left or right to write down short instructions for people who don't have the option to watch the video with sound.

Would agree that next time your voice should be much louder :) its pretty common for people to make their own voice quieter cause nobody likes hearing their own voice haha. But yeah next time dont be afraid to lower the music and increase the volume of your voice! Btw i work in sound editing/mixing as my job so if you have any questions about this stuff can always ask me happy to assist. Great content, keep going :)

Hey CW, the limiting factor right now is my internet speed‚Ä¶ I am usually ready and waiting to download the yt audio, and the set up for the podcast takes a couple minutes. Usually takes 30 - 45 mins to upload. If you could get the audio to me, I can schedule it no problem.

I started with dev updates, basically because I felt they would work well in podcast format, but I was thinking about committing to doing every video. I just didn‚Äôt know if there would be a demand, and since ama‚Äôs are live they may not flow as well for people listening‚Ä¶

Hey. Been away for a while. For my defense, I have suffered a complete crypto burnout and was diagnosed with depression as a result. My socials are tuned back to next to 0 activity and I am focusing on building. I have deployed a set of Ergo nodes load balanced over Asia, North America and Europe, so whichever you are closest to will automatically process your transaction. The node address is https://ergo.eutxo.net, feel free to try it in SAFEW. I am going on a short holiday but I intend to expose an ErgoMixer endpoint too in the same fashion, I'll keep you all posted when it happens

Hey everyone, so I‚Äôd like to update the cover art for the ergo podcast, and I‚Äôm wondering if this would be ok? I‚Äôll be changing the name to Ergo Updates, because I‚Äôll be moving from uploading only the dev updates, to dev updates and AMAs.

[08/28/2022 11:24 PM] rustinmyeye#3722
I can upload cover art for each individual episode, so I was thinking of altering the current dev update thumbnail to fit the square format, and make one for ama as well.

Pass me the dimensions and will share some designs, more relateable to the human eye, there are couple of things you are missing there, 

-Ergo uses Saira o Montserrat font in most of the infographics and caps most of time in headlines


[08/30/2022 3:23 PM] rustinmyeye#3722
Awesome! I decided to just call the podcast Ergo Podcast for now, and use the black on white ergo logo. I was overthinking things and thought simple might be best. But I‚Äôm really not the right person to make any decisions like this‚Ä¶ let me know what you come up with, the cover art is supposed to be 1400 pixels square.

Hey, would you be able to make it with square corners? It looks great but, it doesn‚Äôt work so well with the different podcast platforms, because they use different corner radius‚Äôs or square corners. Spotify, and apple apple podcasts round the corners automatically, and Amazon podcasts and others are showing white triangles on the corners.

In the same ways I‚Äôve always been.  To be a helpful ambassador for Ergo and provide a platform to share common interests and goals between Ergo & the UTXO Alliance and other guest speakers. That‚Äôs my most consistent effort with a proven track record stretching back to May 2022. I‚Äôve never missed a weekly interview upload with shared values or substance. I always will provide a Monthly GPU Market Update for the Post-Merge world of curious orphaned miners. Normalizing Weekly Twitter Spaces. More Ergo Education on the way to target the more speculative retail investors, etc.

@hashoshi4 How eUTxO is different from UTxO model ? This can be a nice topic to discuss about $erg & $ada. 

Many miners are shifting from ETH to ERGO before #merge and they don't have clarity about eUTxO model !

Hi guys , now that I am solo doing ergcube there are few things I would like to get opinions from your guys ..
- main concern of content creators is (we won't get likes and comments on ergcube) obviously ..
it's an embedded video.(I am providing you free marketing)
But ergcube users can leave a comment there 
How  would you guys like ergcube to be adapted to the ecosystem ?
-Be more Vocal and spam videos o just adding them to web and share on Twitter.
Should I tell all ecosystem content creators to directly share video with ergcube link o let them share YouTube ?
My technical writting isn't so great , need to write down some static pages like faq, about us stuff ... If someone can colab, would be great ‚ù§Ô∏è

Forwarded from crandano: @ergomergoadargo link to the Reddit and Twitter post here. I‚Äôll update the Reddit when back at my computer as it seems we could start this Friday. Hashtags could include DiscoverErgoHack, hackathon, developers, miners, mining, eUTxO

as has been suggested. How does that sound to everyone? Anything to add or take away from the Reddit post?


[09/22/2022 6:20 PM] crandano#0000
Any other suggestions for editing the Reddit post on ErgoHack awareness?

Forwarded from crandano: Updated the Reddit post to include some more hashtags, an example Tweeet from Sisyphus (@Ergonauts1). Made sure to note there's no official start date as making posts and talking to other cryptocurrency communities should begin ASAP.

Registration for the upcoming #ErgoHack is still open! 

Great opportunity for #developers & #miners to submit ideas/proposals around #mining & #minting.

Exciting time to be building on #Ergo & to be a part of the #Ergonaut community.

I think we can also highlight past Ergo Hack prize winners that have successfully implemented their project. Maybe get a small snippet from Team/Dev about their Ergo hack experience and what it meant for their projects development. #Testamonial

 I like this. Do we have a list?


[09/23/2022 6:29 AM] JŒµnniŒµ D#1687
It's in the doc I am putting together
I wouldn't know how to start on success metric per se
We could however bring up instances of their success when we bring them up
In some cases it's easy, like with the ergo raffle. A lot of successful raffles for charity which concretely helped, as well as to implement grassroots ergonaut activities, which highlights our grassroots component

That would be really appreciated! I tried my hand at creating something for the upcoming Space....let's just say there was an effort made, lol


[09/23/2022 2:06 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
If there was a template that you made where I can update info on it (date, time, guest, topics, etc.) that would work great


[09/23/2022 2:08 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Also, if its something you are interested in, the NFT space could use a logo to represent the space as well. I could use it on their Discord server, Twitter Community, and any other promotional pieces we end up doing. I threw something together for the Community banner on Twitter


[09/23/2022 2:09 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
@NoahErgo, CW mentioned you might have an App that would be able to make recorded Twitter spaces able to be turned into a podcast. If so, would you please share with me?

Hey guys does anybody know if we have any kind of roster for which community devs have which skills?

Seems often times people are looking for devs but don't know who has what skills. Might be cool to have a simple list roster for frontend/backend/ui design/python/java/scala/ etc.

One thing I would love to work on as a Sigmanaut is improving Ergo's presence on opensource and decentralized (or federated) social media platforms.

We have a matrix space for example that is very underused!

Would love to get us active on Mastodon, Aether, Lemmy, PeerTube, etc.

As the Manifesto says, decentralization is born from education.

If Ergo is to be a leader in decentralization, we should do our best to encourage the use of social media that is consistent with that ethos.

@essaias Welcome :ergo_orange:


[11/15/2022 5:25 AM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Welcome aboard!


[11/15/2022 5:42 AM] essaias#5787
Good morning everyone, thanks for having me here and thanks to @TypoDaPsycho for inviting me into the program.

When I 'found' ERGO in early 2021 I got excited about the technical details of it and the large potential it comes with, which in my opinion had and yet has to be raised. I decided to mine some ERGs to be part of the show - and to be able to try SigUSD, the Auction house etc. So I bought some used AMD rx480 and put together some insanely power hungry mining rigs. To get some better overview on the mining algorithms and the difficulty changes I put up the Epoch & Difficulty monitor, which is since then hammering the ERGO Explorer API... üòâ 

Back then the documentation was telling you to set up a full node and use its wallet so I did exactly that. I think there really have not been any alternative wallets - or I never found them back then. Right now I am using Nautilus and the "Mr Stahlfelge wallet". To keep participating in the network, although I did not need that full node wallet anymore, I moved the node to some VPS I already had for some other projects and opened it up. Some months later I added another public node as there was some more space on another VPS I run. 

I am also involved in other crypto projects - not the dump n scam sort of - more projects where I believe in either the technology and/or philosophy. (Eg. I am also operating FLUX nodes and moderating their discord.)

Aside from crypto I used to be a software developer (C++/C#), a project manager and now work as product owner and COO of a Germany based IT company providing solutions for media companies (large to very small). Later is the reason why I am not available 24/7 as the day job really takes a good piece of time, and ofc my family also needs me to be the loving and soccer playing husband and dad üòâ

I hope to spread the word about ERGO and support the community. 
More than ever we need projects that help (and not take from) people - and ERGO is one of these good ones.

Looks like the Sigcans and the Sigmanauts will have general chats merged, this will help us all get to know each other better and hopefully assist Sigcans to have a better understanding of leveling up into a voting position on many different topics that arise - glad to support this move  that will allow for more Sican participation in developing the Sigmanaut program, there will be a few things of discussion Sigmanauts will keep in their channel of operations with some voting etc,  but for the most part we will begin to merge into a channel with Sigcans.

 Crazy year for AI. Could see a big % of content online being human + AI created by mid to end 2023. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we are playing with text prompt to video by end of next year (Imagen has some demos). Wild times ahead.

 A big % is already like that, hopefully it gets a bit better though üòÇ I imagine lots of places are already using it to generate content as a base and just editing it but yeah this is a new level

[12/05/2022 2:41 PM] dadreboi#0000
all i did was make a curl command for the api in a perl script that takes an input and spits out the "text" of the json return...then my telegram bot calls my perl API.

Just a suggestion, perhaps make this channel name Sigmanauts, and the other as something ridiculous like The Sigmanauti, so it is preserved, but at the same time, doesn't turn into some kind of Politburo.


[12/05/2022 4:45 PM] dadreboi#0000
in discord we have sig -gov, sig-social, sig-treasury


[12/05/2022 4:45 PM] dadreboi#0000
could just name this sig-chat?


[12/05/2022 4:46 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Whatever makes sense, just be best to label it what it is, so cans no longer works.


[12/05/2022 4:46 PM] dadreboi#0000
since sigcans are in the sigmanaut programme but not quite yet sigmanauts


[12/05/2022 4:47 PM] cafebedouin#0000

 Right. Chicago Tribune says $213 million a year since 2013.

OMG, and education, extensive requirements, and better pay is too expensive....


[12/05/2022 4:56 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Lots of corruption. City used to be cut into little fiefdoms, which were then passed on to family and relations. For example, we had a member of Congress announce his retirement in such a way that only his designated successor had the ability to get on the ballot, because he did it a week before the 50,000 signatures were due.

Voting will happen in January. Right now Im just taking nominations. It can be done on Twitter, Discord or Reddit. Link to each are in Twitter Thread.


[12/05/2022 6:53 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
If Twitter, just tag the artist or project (& NFT image if applicable) in the tweet/category. There is a thread of all and separate tweets of each category.


[12/05/2022 7:31 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Anybody interested in joining hash it out tonight?

Meeting Notes
All Sigs Monthly Meeting
12/4/22 3PM UTC
17 Sigs and Sigcans in attendance


**Recap to group about the recent Sigmanauts weekly meetings**
This was a high level recap that was essentially a summary of all the past meeting notes already posted.

**Followups from previous meetings**
Ergcube creating a BIO page. HQ has the list of SIGMANAUTS and will start reaching out to them for a brief few sentences about what they see as their role as a sig as well as when they joined the ecosystem. 

**Mission statement** drafts have taken a leap forward! Check out the draft and add comments if you so desire: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J6PdyyxoEEqI0nEr64ZZBGU4Lkr8Cr37GqNSs4qHo7Q/edit?usp=sharing

**Onboarding:** Kill it with Coffee has volunteered to take on this task‚Ä¶which is to diagram the current onboarding documentation and really hone it into a more compact entrance/opening page that gives a sigcan a welcome as well as has them fully aware of their role and the steps to becoming a sigmanaut. We should also look over the onboarding form to make sure we are getting the info we need (ie: require a discord). 

**Voting: **In order to get everyone on board, qx() will program his bot this week to remind people to sign up for voting (DM them). qx() will also fix the other DM‚Äôs by adding a bit more code (they are currently off rn. Make a fasttrack button to sigmanaut, if the vote has reached a quorum and at least 6 people have chosen fast track, they will jump through sigcan right to sigmanaut. 

**Social:** qx() has been dipping his toes in, asked adam for a little help with likes and retweets for now and will reach out to him to get him on tweet deck. There is a weekly template and schedule that can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DICL11y4aDke8xl_FNBLBcx1AMoV78WiscD2AzIQvdk/edit?usp=sharing
Crandano, Sissy, and others are continuing work on gov/treasury breakout groups. 

**Armeanio **spoke about logo contest and really, Dexy outreach and education as a whole. Combining these two he has asked Sigmanauts to come up with a two week plan to educate, involve, and engage the public about dexy WHILE including a social vote on the Dexy logo submissions. Chris has started a thread about it in sig-chat which can be found here in discord: https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/1049209895636959322/1049209898392625212 there were a lot of ideas about how to do this and Chris has put a lot of them up in that thread so I‚Äôll spare the char count here. 

**Noah and Crandano** proposed an ambassadorship for the UTXO alliance. ‚ÄúAnybody can attend the workgroups that are UTXO alliance goal is the facilitate whatever kind of partnership between projects that are building on top of layer 1 ...focus on ambassador projects to show what Sigmanauts are doing and what the pros and cons of certain things that are happening in the UTXO sphere and advantages on ERGO....perhaps a pitch deck. will help meet other ambassador programs‚Äù

**A proposal was set forth** to merge sigcans and sigmanauts chat groups. It was voted almost unanimously with some abstaining or just weren‚Äôt able to find the thumbs up button. Mark set Sigmanauts to slow mode and renamed both discord and tele sigcans to sig-chat (in line with the sig-gov, sig-social, and sig-treasury channels). ‚ÄúWill help engage new sigcans, currently discussion gets bifurcated due to people‚Äôs limited bandwidth. Will foster stronger community and better discussions‚Äù

**There were some discussions about trimming inactive members.** The discussion continues in operational in discord: https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/1027545907975163915/1049014606154190848

after seeing the nft competition format, i am thinking maybe twitter isnt right place to have the Dexy logo cmpetition


[12/07/2022 8:49 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Thinking maybe a read only telegram channel and people can react @dadreboithat worked pretty well


[12/07/2022 8:50 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I also think its worth pushing for a few more professional submissions cause currently a lot of them are kind of rough (my personal opinion only)


[12/07/2022 8:51 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
Yeah, relying on socials isn't as clean as a dedicated site and is best suited to spread awareness. @HQ3rr is currently working on a voting feature for ErgCube. If finished in time, NFT Award voting may be a good test case for it


[12/07/2022 8:52 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
Currently just taking nominations for NFT Awards, so socials have been serviceable in getting community to submit favorites


[12/07/2022 8:53 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
We need something like Voteaire for these types of things, IMHO


[12/07/2022 8:54 PM] sisyphuspush#0000

[12/07/2022 9:04 PM] dadreboi#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *Thinking maybe a read only telegram channel and people can react @dadreboithat worked pretty well*) 
 
 we could also do what i'm doing with anetaBTC for the next stage of a logo vote (and similar to what getblok did for EIP-37 vote).

1. Do a huge campaign for Dexy logo
2. Tell everyone they simply need a NON CEX ergo wallet with at least 1 ERG in it
3. I snapshot the entire chain and make a DEXYVOTE token.
4. I then airdrop 10 or so tokens per ergo wallet with above at least 1 erg content. 
5. I make X number of wallets for the logos....
6. people go to a site and send DEXYVOTE token to the wallet that corrosponds to the image they want to vote for...
7. Live wallet content stats are shown as the voting peroid is open
8. After a set time we take a snapshot and vote is over. 

This will
--allow a big campaign push for dexy
--raise awareness of holding tokens in non CEX wallets
--allow us to show off the wallet options
--and we can make it last a couple weeks with lots of edu material as Armeanio suggested

Chris also has some points in the sub thread about possibilities.


[12/07/2022 9:29 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Thats a very very cool idea


[12/07/2022 9:30 PM] NoahErgo#0000

We also have the ability to create user addresses. For example, I made qx@sigmanauts.com and the display name is "qx Sigmanaut". We can discuss sunday about the proper usage of custom addresses, but should make treasury@sigmanauts.com and governance@sigmanauts.com and social@sigmanauts.com etc....lets see what people think on Sunday.

- **Ambassador program** for Sigs to UTXO alliance and others (Noah, Crandano, Foeniculum) - IN PROGRESS - looks like Noah has been reaching out gathering some info from projects. Reach out to him if interested. 

**If one of you volunteered to help with anything during the meeting and I forgot, please ping me!

from the raffle ^


[12/08/2022 3:13 PM] NoahErgo#4349
seems a tall order to ask for that much but development costs are not cheap


[12/08/2022 3:14 PM] dadreboi#0000
my question is what's the division of labor...
how much work will it take to immplement what spectrum would hand over...
I agree, 15k seems pretty steep for a design...
Can yasha give a PM or workflow to help us better understand?


[12/08/2022 3:15 PM] NoahErgo#4349
i think you are free to ask him

Hard to see a 15,000 Erg raffle making it in this market.


[12/08/2022 5:05 PM] dadreboi#0000
i suggested to yasha that they drop it deeper into the community but "facilitate it".


[12/08/2022 5:05 PM] dadreboi#0000
qx(), [Dec 8, 2022 at 10:28:26 AM]:
i think it could be sold better as a community effort to better explorer...with specturm facilitating it
then when presented to EF to immplement, there is no question that community wasn't involved or behind it etc.
and the best part of it is you can use it as advertising/promotion
you'll have to deal with the community, which can be a pain in the ass...
but control would still be mostly in your hands....

[12/08/2022 6:14 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Imo the probability that they get 15k with the information they provide is close to zero. The raffle text has a character limit, but he could have made a twitter thread explaining what exactly they want to do, how long it will approximately take and why they are asking for 15k Erg.

Heyo, post about trimming Sigmanauts a little is here and could use follow up and perspective:

https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/1027545907975163915/1027545907975163915

if you scroll down a bit Glasgow made a good list for Stay, Reactivate, Go, ToSort

How should we proceed? Cut the 'Go' section and send an email making sure people know they're allowed to apply any time in the future?

at the bottom I created a post about the 'ToSort' people and the activity I've seen

We could also put Hollo up for a vote as @Haskell_plus made a post about this @dadreboi 

@glasgowm anyway I could get a screenshot of the current SigCans? I know that we have a list but it would be nice to see who all is actually in the Discord so we can further sort

lemme fix my voting app one last time tonight or tomorrow too


[12/08/2022 8:00 PM] dadreboi#0000
did we have any thought about moving sigs down to sigcans if they didn't participate enough to even abstain?


[12/08/2022 8:00 PM] dadreboi#0000
and then we just prune sigcans that are totally inactive?


[12/08/2022 8:00 PM] crandano#0000
thanks. as we can see there's a lot of inactive people for a while. how would yall like to proceed? most of these people do have emails

(re @dadreboi : *did we have any thought about moving sigs down to sigcans if they didn't participate enough to even abstain?*) 
 
 i have some thoughts on this I'll create a post now and throw it into governance workgroup - been procrastinating this so glad you mention it


[12/08/2022 8:01 PM] crandano#0000
or do you think i should post in operational?


[12/08/2022 8:01 PM] dadreboi#0000
i think it needs to be done asap so post wherever you think you'll get the most engagement


[12/08/2022 8:02 PM] dadreboi#0000
and i think you'll also have to make some decisions due to lack of engagement during the week and bring what you think is best to the meeting


[12/08/2022 8:02 PM] dadreboi#0000
then we execute it if no one has issues


[12/08/2022 8:02 PM] dadreboi#0000
i know it's not the most desierable but we are such low numbers at this stage sometimes it's ok to make a plan with the engagement you have at the moment and then ask the group meetings to deploy


[12/08/2022 8:04 PM] sisyphuspush#0000
Once Mission/vison/values is voted on and passed, I'll hop into helping with expectations, procedures for demoting and procedures for taking time off. Will mention it this Sunday and see if anyone else wants to help with it


[12/08/2022 8:05 PM] crandano#0000
yep, on the decision making side something we do in a different group i'm in is - say for the Treasury Group - if we come to a decision we give it 14days for anyone in the broader group to discuss, ask for changes, agree/disagree. that way we can bring it up in that next meeting, and if nobody or not enough people disagree with the change then it's implemented

then quarterly we can always review policies and be willingly malleable to change

my thoughts are essentially how serious do we want the program to be. as sisyphus mentions we can decide on thresholds. in my opinion, if we eventually have a treasury then there needs to be a threshold of participation perhaps

I'm also looking personally to prod the question of how serious this is as I'm contemplating thoughts on governance and treasury. i'm fine at the end of the day if we want Sigmanauts to be very loose, but i want to know what the expectation is before committing time and thought into it. I enjoy taking things seriously if i think there could be large impact. I don't want to do that if that isn't the goal

and of course there could be a more middle-ground approach to this


[12/08/2022 11:08 PM] cafebedouin#0000
My view is that groups are defined by their centers and not their peripheries. I'm never going to be at the center of a group. There are people like me that have niches, and it is good to be open to whatever help people want to give. Drawing hard lines tends to drive wedges and encourage a certain kind of conformity, like attracting like and all.

 good PoV here. question, are you seeing yourself able to hit "abstain" on voting to still participate in the process and of course yes or no when you are more informed of what the vote is?

 Makes sense, I like your perspective. My thinking is once we have a treasury and need to make a vote in the future. If someone hasn‚Äôt been around for months and never voted - but suddenly something comes up and they want to vote on it - is that okay? Or should there be some minimum criteria. As a loose example

 I think a lot of us are on the same page with the participation threshold, judging from a lot of the convo in the past.


[12/08/2022 11:23 PM] crandano#0000
A reason I haven‚Äôt made a post about governance yet until today (sort of a gov post) is because these conversations have a lot of deep roots. Who decides a threshold/criteria? Who enforces it? etc

 I generally view the more votes the better. Of course, brigading can be an issue, so maybe some kind of mechanism to redo a vote in the case of some kind of shenanigans. But, more of a possible future problem I don't want to wrestle with too deeply until it becomes a problem.

 Well that‚Äôs the thing I‚Äôm trying to discuss laying a foundation because once funds and treasury are involved we need to know how we would like to proceed

 I think we can take the same approach we did with the Mission Statements...The people that want to take up the work of defining these thresholds and such can work on it as a side group, present it to larger group for editing, then put it up for vote.


[12/08/2022 11:26 PM] dadreboi#0000

 It's good to think through problems in advance, but also good to be biased toward action. Roll it out, be permissive and see if any problems arise. I prefer more openness and iteration.

(re @cafebedouin : *It's good to think through problems in advance, but also good to be biased toward action. Roll it out, be permissive and see if any problems arise. I prefer more openness and iteration.*) 
 
 Agreed. Much of what we work on will need to be amenable to change as we grow and evolve. Much of building from scratch is a give and take to figure our what works. What may work for us the next year may end up being a bottleneck down the road. Part of the blessing of it being a smaller group ATM is it allows up to have these discussions and test things out prior to it being much more difficult to do so.


[12/09/2022 4:27 AM] Chris Ray#2713
I am interested, I like to see the idea of thresholds and I think we could do this with some kind of ranking - find a way to create a pathway for officers and boards - let me think on it for a bit - pretty swamped lately

Are we able to create a forum on here? I was thinking of creating one similar to the operational one that would just be the various working groups that are active. Each group then could have their own tags and posts for the various aspects they are working on. Would making tracking work and discussions easier, IMHO


[12/10/2022 4:17 PM] drehaf#0090
moreso than the working group channels?


[12/10/2022 4:17 PM] drehaf#0090
that can then break into threads in those channels?

If each group had their own forum, it could be self sustained somewhat by the people working on it


[12/10/2022 4:21 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
and easily reviewed by those who want to just keep up to date

[12/10/2022 4:30 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Is the only way to take a post in operational and get it to the new forum through linking it?


[12/10/2022 4:30 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
But I like this...may take some time to get used to through


[12/10/2022 4:31 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Channels can be used to discuss things in a broad sense by everyone, where forums are for those working on it


[12/10/2022 4:31 PM] drehaf#0090
i think u have to start fresh


[12/10/2022 4:31 PM] drehaf#0090
i don't see any way to move it


[12/10/2022 4:32 PM] drehaf#0090
u could archive and lock it in operational and paste the list as a "for reference only" in the new forum


[12/10/2022 4:32 PM] glasgowm#9381
a lot of channels - benefits of forums is you dont need to do that, can just use new tags


[12/10/2022 4:33 PM] drehaf#0090
hmmm good point...i just feel lost in forums if they aren't maintained


[12/10/2022 4:33 PM] drehaf#0090
like i'm missing out


[12/10/2022 4:33 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
So maybe instead of channel have a post within each forum set up as general discussion about group and its work?


[12/10/2022 4:33 PM] drehaf#0090
at the top of forum, that's a good point


[12/10/2022 4:33 PM] drehaf#0090
then we can remove the main sig-XXX channels and rename the forums


[12/10/2022 4:34 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeh I'd just make a general discussion post and more detailed chats can get their own posts, all using the same tag which you can use to filter at the top

hmmm


[12/10/2022 4:57 PM] glasgowm#9381
yeah 1 central place gives people the best chance to keep up, 4 forums would be a bit much i think vs just selecting the tag and having it act like its own forum


[12/10/2022 5:03 PM] drehaf#0090

ok i think i figured out the vote notifications...gonna split the main script into two separate cron jobs...1st one will go ever five minutes and do the normal processing and posting to the vote channel if there is a new vote or it triggers the status change (new, reminder, last reminder, closed)....second cron job will just run once a day and simply ping people to vote that haven't...works better as two scripts i think.

Zoom is more suitable I think


[12/11/2022 2:49 PM] HQ3rr#0000
My opinion


[12/11/2022 2:50 PM] dadreboi#0000
zoom prob gets more current community memebers, twitter might cast a bigger net perhaps?


[12/11/2022 2:50 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
(re @dadreboi : *zoom prob gets more current community memebers, twitter might cast a bigger net perhaps?*) 
 
 Twitter spaces would be easier to join imo


[12/11/2022 2:50 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Why only use one?


[12/11/2022 2:50 PM] dadreboi#0000
u mean bridge the chats?


[12/11/2022 2:50 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000

[12/11/2022 2:51 PM] HQ3rr#0000

[12/11/2022 2:51 PM] HQ3rr#0000

[12/11/2022 2:51 PM] HQ3rr#0000
And maybe internal giveaways


[12/11/2022 2:51 PM] HQ3rr#0000
Of small amount of rewards


[12/11/2022 2:51 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
The problem would only be to convince people to use zoom; there's no buzz if they cba logging in and joining that way üòÇ


[12/11/2022 2:52 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
Could be twitter space + live tweets about the things you want to create a buzz about, so you can pin them on the space


[12/11/2022 2:52 PM] HQ3rr#0000
I can creat a website for audio video chat with guest login

Twitter Spaces are powerhouses, if someone sees I am on a space they can just click on my profile to see where I'm speaking/listening


[12/11/2022 2:58 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
and that creates a chain effect


[12/11/2022 2:58 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000

Imo we could focus marketing communications on pushing a) projects that are in beta and/or b) are close to releasing something major soon-ish

e.g. twitter threads / infographics about:

a) Duckpools
‚Äî-> What are lending protocols?
‚Äî-> How does Duckpools differ from other lending protocols?
‚Äî-> What's on the roadmap?
‚Äî-> Tutorial of the beta

b) Spectrum Finance
‚Äî-> SPF tokenomics
‚Äî-> How is it different from Cardano DEXes?
‚Äî-> How do they avoid frontrunning through permissionless batching?

I'm seeing quite some interest in gaming / gambling the last days. not the metaverse stuff. more traditional stuff like cards, betting etc. 

still that has the problem to offer a fast and easy fiat onramp for erg to be successfull. any ideas?

 On ramping via exchanges we are at the mercy of infrastructure and list costs with larger exchanges. 

In terms of debit ramping that needs to be integrated on the wallet level, it makes no sense for it to be a liability for the foundation. 

I have set up and forwarded some discussions to zengate.


[12/11/2022 6:03 PM] essaias#5787
i know and used instaswap.io (they now also offer fiat via CC) another provider you might talk to

we have teir coo in flux chat, might help getting in contact


[12/11/2022 6:06 PM] essaias#5787
Another interesting approach might be metalpay / proton. they have many wrapped tokens (but are also quite unknown as of now) they have SEPA payments in eu+us (not knowing of the rest of the world)


[12/11/2022 6:06 PM] Armeanio#0000
(re  : *<essaias> we have teir coo in flux chat, might help getting in contact*) 
 
 Sure happy to have a discussion. 

The second question beyond integration costs/liability always has to do with liquidity provisions ramps like this require liquidity to be useful. Bisq is a good example.

Absent some actor(s) managing liquidity in some form these are often not so useful in practice.


[12/11/2022 6:09 PM] essaias#5787
that was re: what?


[12/11/2022 6:09 PM] Armeanio#0000
Just discussing ramping mechanisms in practice.


[12/11/2022 6:10 PM] Armeanio#0000
Usually you have a exchange that is using order book liquidity which has its pros and cons, or more of a p2p type environment in which case liquidity provisions are needed for it to be useful.


[12/11/2022 6:11 PM] Armeanio#0000
Often in the p2p environment the larger hurdle in practice is liquidity management.


[12/11/2022 6:13 PM] essaias#5787
I totally understand the argument, and its valid for me. üôÇ - but honestly I do not think that the way they get the liquidity matters for the ppl that will use the service. as they do not know or care about. the most important thing is no signup, no kyc no time wasting


[12/11/2022 6:15 PM] Armeanio#0000
It's not an intended to be an argument just a consideration to understand in such partnerships. 

The question to ask is where will the liquidity come from? Who will manage this if it is going to be useful longer term?


[12/11/2022 6:19 PM] essaias#5787
yeah, they (a third party, have to) manage it. its close to a cex.
ppl coming from centralized money tend to fall back to that mind set. requiring a globally trusted entity. *to give their money to

 Well potentially it is possible to structure it in an open/community oriented way and build some small product around it to assist. Sometimes there is a small incentive for acting as an LP. 

This depends on the ramp.


[12/11/2022 6:22 PM] Armeanio#0000
There are also services that require some random token to swap on the backend imo this should probably be avoided as it can be a little questionable.


[12/11/2022 6:22 PM] essaias#5787
honestly I can imagine putting some erg/‚Ç¨ or erg/$ into a pool. but idk. where üòÑ


[12/11/2022 6:23 PM] essaias#5787
I think even going $->UDST (or any other stable) is a problem if you just want to try it out


[12/11/2022 6:23 PM] Armeanio#0000
For debit rails it makes more sense to plug it into wallets directly but there are some liability considerations for whatever team wants to support that.


[12/11/2022 6:24 PM] Armeanio#0000
Keeping liability away from the core protocol in my mind is pretty important.


[12/11/2022 6:25 PM] essaias#5787
i agree. but I doubt nemo, stahlfelge or satergo do want to register as a payment provider. p2p might solve that. but if you have this directly build into one wallet newcommers choosing the wrong wallet are again cut off

[12/11/2022 6:28 PM] Armeanio#0000
I am reluctant to plug in the EF directly or to use the community treasury for liquidity provisions beyond bare bones exchange requirements. 

To some degree the profit incentive that requires puts one in a position to actively trade for profit/mm etc. 

Many foundations seem to do that directly, but often they have larger treasuries and well the ethics there in my mind are a bit questionable.


[12/11/2022 6:32 PM] essaias#5787
I do not want the EF to be in it. caring for the development is the right take.

being a payment provider probably (i have no clue, just educated guessing) will require legal help and insurances. not to mention the knowledge (of the locally required licenses) - it it way too much to do as a private entity or a small foundation. this usually is where VC comes in. 

if you do it p2p and it successfull it soon will be on the radar of the authorities, which wont help much. 

to conclude, getting an already registered entity to support ERG looks easier to me... thats why I suggested it üòâ

[12/11/2022 6:34 PM] essaias#5787
by the way, where I  see the EF jump in is taking over getblok.io
I think the idea was good but needs some more love to make it successfull. (and in this case EF also should also care not to loose some ERGO specific use cases.)


[12/11/2022 6:36 PM] Armeanio#0000
I've tried to support getblok personally while being as neutral as possible. 

That is somewhat of a tightrope imo since we have other external partners handling the majority of the hashrate. 

I have never seen a core foundation say outright mine pool X. üòÖ


[12/11/2022 6:36 PM] Armeanio#0000

@Sigmanauts @SigCan 
Meeting Notes 12/11/22

**Mission statement**
    - Made a ton of progress this week to almost completion. Lots of good community input and involvement!
    - Will be locked today or tomorrow and pushed to a vote.

**Social**
    - Utilize the index that Rishabh is creating to contact all known coverage of ergo.
    - Create a Community Updates that acts like the wed Dev Updates...those could be covered in the Sigma Update and get content creators to submit their coverage there. 
    - Create a few top level email addresses for @sigmanuts.com email and use that to receive contacts from creators and community as well.

**Ambassadors/UTXO Alliance**
    - Working on pushing rosen bridge in the outreach for its potential to the ergo ecosystem and cross-chain collaboration/integration.
    - cardano working on dReps - books and research papers. IOHK researching a treasury system for crypto enabling better collaborate intelligence. 

**Voting**
    - Will use the mission statement vote to DM all members to get them to sign up and vote.

**DEXY VOTE**
    - There was a lot of discussion about this and how to present moving forward. Some great back and forth and perspective about how to get the best engagement while also educating. 
    - To wrap it all up qx() requested to dump proposals into operational and continue the discussion there with more community involvement. If you have an idea, put it up there.

**Dev suggestions for Sigma Update**
    - Krasavice
    - Night Owl
    - Crypto Quokka
    - anon_real

**New Working Group for Sig Expectations**
    - Adam will start poking away at this discussion group.
    - Voting thresholds, trimming/pruning methods
    - Metrics for activity and engagement
    - Additional roles based on all of this

**Discord Operational**
    - Use tags in operational for Sub Committees now. 
    - There will be a general chat or two pinned up top for Sigmanauts, etc...
    - For now I will do my best, prob along with Mark, to keep these clean.

**Transparency of EF**
    - Quite a bit of talk of EF engagement at the end.
    - qx brought forward that marketing group feels a little like an ivory tower, not much interaction in the community so it feels like decisions are being made without any input of the community. Seems to follow the lines of "here is what we need who wants to do it" instead of bringing the community together and having interested parties feel involved.
    - This brought in a broader discussion about the transparency of the EF as a whole and that this could be because of:
        - Perhaps we just aren't looking in the right place.
        - Perhaps we aren't pushing to be involved.
        and or
        - Perhaps EF has been in a position where this was the most efficient for the times. But, there seems to be a push for a shift in this kind of thinking moving forward.
    - EF should be engaged at the next meeting (or soon) to have an open discussion about these perceptions and observations.


-------------

Action Items

- Adam work on breakout group for sig expectations and engagement
- qx promote mission statement by probing sigs to vote
- Rishabh continue to index and add creation dates on content
- Engage with EF about transparency in an environment that fosters organized  discourse (such as next weeks meeting and not snippets here in chats).
- Social group work on community wed updates process

just saying that their pool was the first to implement and offer parallel assets


[12/11/2022 6:39 PM] essaias#5787
from a miner perspecitve its close to the result of smartpools

to loosely tie dev projects to flux they inveted flux labs. (getblock was part of it btw. a flux parallel asset was planned) - i think thats a good idea

I would love to see more projects doing their own lift with marketing. 

I agree it is too centralized. A part of that responsibility needs to move to projects/community. In PoS there is a nice incentive for stake pool operators to promote their own business etc.

 top of list, it's a good idea


[12/11/2022 6:47 PM] essaias#5787
idk guaswap. the idea of PA is: you mine flux and get parallel assets (flux but on other chains)

as a smart pool you can distribute other tokens (as payout OR (more interesting) **as an addition**) requiring some marketing and contracts with other "providers" on ergo...

Real time example: On VITE some SBP pay the stakers (in part or total) in their own token. So you get vite and VINU ot VITC, depending on what you support.

Translating this to ERGO: 
- we could create a "egame" token, that is issued in mining and can be used in supporting gambling / gaming dApps.


[12/11/2022 6:51 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
(re @dadreboi : *top of list, it's a good idea*)

Duckpools is great but has no funding/expertise to push their marketing, which is something Sigmanauts can help with for the time being!


[12/11/2022 6:51 PM] dadreboi#0000
it's really easy to get in the weeds here in chat....issue is that a lot of this is forgotten by the time the weekly's come around if you don't come to represent yourself OR if you can't do that then just put it on the agenda with your name there so we can reach out to you and present it for you. I can make a base agenda every sunday after the previous meeting, so you have all week to add stuff there.

Within the EF a main goal has been cutting the burn rate to finish the roadmap. As well bringing in some external partners to help support development and market adoption. 

For the purpose of transparency my salary (which I is ERG based to prevent needing to create sell pressure) atm mostly goes to the nautilus and fleet sdk development. Also for time/integration support for the wallet across multiple applications etc.  

I never disclosed that publically, and please don't share it. It was born from frustrations working with Yoroi, for a time that was a serious ecosystem bottleneck. I dont want anyone to dismiss the other wallet development which has been amazing. I worried disclosing that would not be fair to other builders. 

Also personally paying for all the core infrastructure hosting due to Russian sanctions. üòÖ

even if it's a small amount at first, it kick starts the mentality that no one person should be the main support pillar.

Well one goal should be infrastructure distribution. At the moment it is too centralized.

well, anything has to start. if the EF didnt to these things probably nobody would have done. and we have to recall the EF is not a company made to make money.

just alone the idea to let go is a good sign you (personally) care about decentralization.

yet agian the question remains: what is still centralized, (except release manangement) üòâ

 Decentralization requires a certain profit incentive, which takes time to build in an organic way. But I would be happy to work myself out of a job. That has always been the goal. Then can try to build more and be less neutral.


[12/11/2022 7:09 PM] essaias#5787
just to be clear. I do not want to make the EF go away üòâ
If a foundation is "open" and "democratic", its -in my mind- the ideal way to run such a project. I dont have any EF insights, so I cannot judge. 

to get back to my point: is the getblock team open to share their implementation?


[12/11/2022 7:11 PM] Armeanio#0000
I dont want to work at the EF forever. I would be happy to help bootstrap the network, get market access where I am not really needed then move back into the communtiy and build more.

 While u r not infallible, your stance here is extremely admirable and the community should learn from it.


[12/11/2022 7:18 PM] essaias#5787
I think we are all in this chat because we want to help ERGO grow. Everyone is important. Its quite a pleasure to see that its no matter how deep and long you have beein in EF to behave like a normal human being.

Just had a really good chat with CW about my ivory tower concerns. It shows me that we benefit greatly by having a historical EF presence at these weekly meetings.

I honestly believe we are big enough boys and girls to tell the EF to StepTFB if we feel they are trying to push an agenda against or influence the community and or working group. The value they provide as community members far outweighs any of that concern IMHO. If this is an unpopular opinion let‚Äôs chat.

my thoughts are essentially how serious do we want the program to be. as sisyphus mentions we can decide on thresholds. in my opinion, if we eventually have a treasury then there needs to be a threshold of participation perhaps

I'm also looking personally to prod the question of how serious this is as I'm contemplating thoughts on governance and treasury. i'm fine at the end of the day if we want Sigmanauts to be very loose, but i want to know what the expectation is before committing time and thought into it. I enjoy taking things seriously if i think there could be large impact. I don't want to do that if that isn't the goal

and of course there could be a more middle-ground approach to this

 update on UTXO Alliance Discord from arnaud:
"AFAIK yes, there will be a WG meeting this month, on Wednesday, and it's open to everyone. I am co-chair of the group we are currently setting up the agenda but the very first topic would be: What's the goal of the WG, which is something that should stem from stating what are the goals of each WG participant." 

technical workgroup, I believe they said we could talk about Rosen if i remember correctly - do you remember what else they were going to chat about? it's not in the notes and i forgot

 Proper way of doing that would be..
"He guys, I want to reward 30 erg on twitter giveaway..."
-What should be  the  ask?
-What topic,type,genre of content ?
-Can we have some explaining graphics?
-How to distribute rewards ?
At the end of few days 
Voting on 
"this is good" Vs "this is bad"
And start and event...
I m just trying to creat a path for things on how they should be done in future..my 2 cents

@Sigmanauts. Made post #deleted-channel for those that would like to join the working group to go over Sigmanaut expectations and such. Looking to get started by the end of the week. As we look to trim inactive members, having guidelines on expectations and how we quantify activity will assist us in these determinations as well as guide members on how they can best participate, even when availability might be limited.

Hi bot ,Why we feel more exuasted on days when we don't do much work?


[12/13/2022 6:26 PM] dadreboi#0000
all im saying is when u build stuff, consider the future...if you are siloing something that is next to impossible to migrate to a new platform, that's gonna make it hard for the next peoples that come along.  you should also always feel free to build what you want and show it to the community as well as your peers to garner support for adoption...


[12/13/2022 6:33 PM] dadreboi#0000
for example...the voting program no one will ever build on top of simply because i built it in an ancient language that no one uses for this stuff...it will have to be redone or taken over by paideia or something like it...BUT...everything is built into a MySQL db so that we can xfer it at any time to any other DB/service. in short, yes, build what you want when you see a need and present it to your peers...my advice is that don't build it because you want to own it and not depend on anyone, build it because you want others to own it and depend on eachother üòâ

@Sigmanauts Friendly reminder that there are 2 candidates and the Mission Statement proposal that are currently up for vote. Out of the 18 Sigs that have signed up for the voting app, we have 10 votes on the Mission Statement thus far. Please make sure to sign up for the voting app and start voting if you haven't already. Reach out to @drehaf or myself if you have any questions on how to sign up. Things are starting to move fast with structuring the program and the more input and engagement we have with with these things, the more inclusive and representative the program will be.

[12/18/2022 6:10 AM] drehaf#0090
@glasgowm Sig application form is ready to go and for now are the same questions as the typeform, please feel free to change the website with this link: https://my.ergoport.dev/sigcan_form.html

Will make a CNAME and or 3rd level (apply.sigmanauts.com or whatever) once we get sig domain further along

EVERYONE: We can discuss changes to this form at today's meeting.
Like the typeform, anyone can fill it out, it adds all the data to a backend database as well as creates a new vote in that table which then gets into the push and display system like the current ones, which, you can then vote on via web, telebot, or discordbot.

Will do some work tomorrow night to auto welcome members that pass, Sis is working on some new verbiage. 

When that's done, it should be 100% automated, except for you guys actually voting................................ üòâ

[12/18/2022 4:43 PM] liquid_phase#4605
I do know of a very robust open-source team collaboration tool which could very easily be forked and modified to talk to ergo. If there is interest in a long-term customized solution for project management and bounties, it may be a nice thing to explore - especially as we get more devs in sigmanauts who can work with the code (mostly just html/js/css)


[12/18/2022 4:44 PM] glasgowm#9381

Glad u brought this up üôÇ


[12/18/2022 4:46 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i use software developed by this company elsewhere in my day-to-day.


[12/18/2022 4:46 PM] liquid_phase#4605
they make other stuff which is very powerful, but its all based on their 'frappe framework' which is the single best full stack framework i've found


[12/18/2022 4:47 PM] glasgowm#9381
Looks nice, no demo tho :(


[12/18/2022 4:47 PM] liquid_phase#4605
open source sir, clone the repo and run it locally


[12/18/2022 4:47 PM] liquid_phase#4605
or i can set up a demo somewhere and let you all access it


[12/18/2022 4:47 PM] glasgowm#9381
If you find a free alternative to checkvist hmu, best I've found for personal stuff (not great for collab tho)


[12/18/2022 4:47 PM] liquid_phase#4605
the idea here is, its the base of any other project management tool - but we can FULLY customize the code


[12/18/2022 4:51 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah sounds good, Notion and the likes not really sustainable long-term due to cost, best to have it on something open-source.


[12/18/2022 4:52 PM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#2653
So what if we got together and worked on customizing it as a group


[12/18/2022 4:52 PM] liquid_phase#4605
also a benefit: their framework can allow other 'apps' to talk to the same codebase


[12/18/2022 4:53 PM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#2653
Try to make it a sigmanaut implementation only first and then once the bugs are worked out expand it to the community


[12/18/2022 4:53 PM] liquid_phase#4605
so if we for instance wanted to grow into their ERP, or helpdesk software, their framework allows sharing the same DB/codebase


[12/18/2022 4:53 PM] liquid_phase#4605
or setting up new ones

[12/18/2022 4:54 PM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#2653
Although given the current environment, would it be more beneficial for the sigs and the community if I started to pick up and learn ERG script so I could start work on assisting projects throughout the community as a freelancer?


[12/18/2022 4:54 PM] liquid_phase#4605
worth noting: the frappe framework is used by the largest auction/ecommerce site in India. so its no slouch for large scale implementation


[12/18/2022 4:57 PM] glasgowm#9381
To play devils advocate, downside is maintenance/building it. Using a private GitLab repo or something and utilising the project management tools there might be enough.


[12/18/2022 4:58 PM] liquid_phase#4605
yup. but modifying an existing codebase to do something is easier than doing from scratch - so, if there was a long term view for the community involvement, gitlab and stuff wouldn't be as usable in my eyes to non-devs, but probably pretty fine for active devs


[12/18/2022 5:00 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i guess it depends on how big we see this scaling up. the framework i suggested does have the need of a dev to setup and maintain - so there's opbvious benefits to using a cloud service if we weren't a group actively filled with some of the best devs i've ever seen (ergo in general)


[12/18/2022 5:01 PM] liquid_phase#4605
but as we are, as we are, i do believe we have the ability and followthrough to setup and maintain something like that, even if it was initially done so by a small team of volunteers (raises hand) until merit proven


[12/18/2022 5:08 PM] liquid_phase#4605
plus what would it look like on github if we opened a new repo / PR every single time a community project/discussion needed to take place? i think that kinda muddies up the purpose of github being specific to development and code repository updates


[12/18/2022 5:36 PM] glasgowm#9381
GitLab was just an example of somewhere there‚Äôs a free kanban board hosted, where you could setup notifications for every sigmanaut without cost and sort via labels rather than new repos. May be something more appropriate but just an idea - don‚Äôt let me stop you.


[12/18/2022 5:37 PM] liquid_phase#4605
oh i wasnt aware gitlab had a kanban board feature


[12/18/2022 5:38 PM] liquid_phase#4605
which are kinda nice to have from a 10 thousand foot perspective of task completion but i prefer personal task lists/gannt charts myself (which often tie to the kanban boards in the various software choices)


[12/18/2022 5:39 PM] liquid_phase#4605
in any case, i will likely setup an instance of gameplan in a cloud somewhere and we can chat about it more then and see how likable it is

@Sigmanauts @SigCan 

Sigmanaut Meeting Notes
12/18/22

I'm blending action and meeting notes, this wed I'll shoot out the mid week action reminder separately. 


- Sis has made a TON of progress on the structure/participation/expectations document. Visible here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v1AhGr7cRMk9uP-d9SUmUu9aDJ06rHfuiUKvghXFpa4/edit
Sis will continue to develop this with the help of the community and those that want to participate.

- qx sent out about 50 discord and tele DM's with voting instructions as well as mission statement vote link...there are now 12 votes on it and 18 Sigs signed up to vote! 

- Rishabh continues to work on an inventory of anything on the web that mentions or talks about ergo https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V7nNTVHEJ-ndBwa19kPOraivGU2zaDKdF6O17QXz76g/edit

- EF on qx's initial concern about ivory tower. CW came into chat last sunday and cleared up a lot of things on how/why/what they choose to write on and focus about. I urge people to read through it as it clears a lot of stuff up (all of my perceived questions were answered)

- EF's transparency concerns as well as questions as to why the EF doesn't fund marketing for projects. Mark has been working on a transparency document that you can see here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tw0QWU8fXFjxC4o5YLReGA1sdlaRgXoUcI4kcXL4BAs/edit
There was a brief discussion recapitulating the desire for EF to fund in some way, or help with projects marketing and even though the original people bringing that concern weren't present, qx and coffee attempted to clarify. The consensus was that the document that Mark is working on will help set a baseline of transparency and expectations, and, that as the Sigs continue, this should be in their pipeline to help promote these types of project fair and balanced. 

- Social Group: qx will create a proposed framework for COMMUNITY UPDATES. This will be similar to dev updates on discord but welcome events, coverage, youtube, spaces....essentially anything non dev ERGO. CW and qx will then cover these in part of their weekly The Sigma Update. Hopefully this sparks interest as well as give creators a place to make the community aware of their content. 

- SIG MEETINGS recording. At the start of the next meeting qx will give a warning that people may change name, shut off camera, and he will hit record...After the meeting, qx will provide ONLY the shared screen view w/audio...since it is recording it will also produce an auto transcript, which, we will also post. 

.


[12/18/2022 8:53 PM] drehaf#0090
- Crandano spoke about Dework pros and cons (assignment of tasks as well as task points) as well as there was more discussion on other pieces of software that could help manage it. He showed a demo of it https://dework.xyz/ 
- liquid_phase also mentioned in chat a organizational and collaboration tool and posted the link to sig-chat: https://github.com/frappe/gameplan/
It was also discussed that EF (CW) uses a system that charges per user and that works very well. 
- Crandano is going to explore options here and do a little comparing. 

- kill it with coffee completely flow charted the current Notion site that has current onboarding here: https://www.canva.com/design/DAFU-g4vsM4/925Xj_mGezyPOgrAMvSTNg/view?utm_content=DAFU-g4vsM4&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton
This was also posted in chat today, created by TypoDaPsycho: https://ergonaut.space/en/Ergo/Contributing/Sigmanauts
qx will gather the operational that Chris and or Jennie started and create a place where sig-cans can also help with this.

- sis and qx will work on a new welcome statement to welcome Flip and Cheese in the next few days. 

- last week we discussed merging the sig- chats into operational and create a few pinned chats at the top of it to replace that. Mark suggested using the private thread feature for the few Sigmanauts only pinned threads. qx can chat more with Mark this week so we are all on the same page about the execution.

- Suggested by HQER (sorry i missed this, thought it was part of the bringing it forward from last week). Suggestions for things that social can cover:
Things to consider working on socials in upcoming weeks:
Why Cardano cross chain projects ? it's mostly free engagement because most of sigmanauts are in constant touch with cardano devs and ecosystem on socials 
spectrum finance (spf launch) 
Ergolend (exle) more information and documentation about p2p (it has emotional factor which is not getting used,neither in Ui or Ux or branding on socials which can be a nice touch to gain more engagement)
Rosenbridge , documentation and what possibilities and future opportunity it brings

- CW to give Sis and Jennie access to Sigmanauts tweet deck to start helping out üôÇ

- Things to remember to check on moving forward so we don‚Äôt forget
Paper wallets for tipping to get the grassroots movement going
ERGCUBE bio page for community members

[12/18/2022 9:06 PM] drehaf#0090
ninja edit about some members questioning EF on why not help with promoting projects in the ecosystem with FUNDS, i didn't word it well the first time....if you need to know where this main discussion was, it was last sunday around 10pm UTC or so in the ergonauts chat in the discord/tele. Personally, I think Marks work on a transparency document will set the baseline and expectations on what the EF does in that regard and the discussion should continue with the community Sigs about bounties, compensation, marketing...etc...


[12/18/2022 9:07 PM] drehaf#0090

IMHO, the level in which the EF currently promotes on their platforms current community projects, FAR out paces any other central body in the crypto space....

 Try using MGPai‚Äôs pre synced node‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs my next experiment.

Should save a couple days of sync time

so just formatting nit pickery, but i'd put the 'what is a box' right under 'These Output boxes then serve as Input boxes for a later transaction.' and then incorporate the two bullet points from 'transaction building' to under the 'building a transaction' heading. It might also be worth noting as a *TIP! that constructor inputs are not verbatim and will require the person implementing the code to choose their best course of implementation. looking fantastic overall!

Hey guys, Rustin is gonna step back from signcan‚Ä¶heavy structure isn‚Äôt his thing for now and might look into it again once we have smaller sub groups that focus on specific things of his interest. He‚Äôs still going to be active in the community, so we didn‚Äôt lose him completely.

wouldn't call it a step back just normal for certain personality types - i'm fairly adverse to large organized groups as well and made my comments about it in private to qx() but im sure more people will 'want to stay degens' while still contributing in their own special way to the ecosystem and that's why i'm personally a fan of compartmentalizing the efforts into subgroups

 yeah, i also think we really have to make sure we faciliate a good way for people that engage outside of organization to be heard. hopefully what you say about more relaxed smaller sub groups will fit the bill for many too.

....and we might see some more of this too before we see less, fyi...in my experience it's part of the process.


[12/19/2022 2:19 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Yeah, more of a free radical myself, but it's near impossible to run a group above a certain size that way. Groups like the Hutterites keep group sizes in the 50-150 and companies range between 60-200 in the army (or centuries, if you use the Roman model), this keeps it within the Dunbar number, but you still need structure. Get it down to squad size of 10 or so, and you can do without much structure. But that size limits the range of what you can do.


[12/19/2022 2:20 PM] liquid_phase#4605
yup, even the folks who ran burning man became 'the org' when they saw it become large enough to pose a threat to both society and themselves


[12/19/2022 2:20 PM] liquid_phase#4605

[12/19/2022 2:21 PM] liquid_phase#4605
just like the people who say 'the burn was better before it commercialized'


[12/19/2022 2:23 PM] cafebedouin#9837
The funny thing about a lot of the Cacophony Society events, like Burning Man, Santa crawl, etc. is they were only supposed to be done once.


[12/19/2022 2:24 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Well, the group grew out of the Suicide Club, the whole thing is about unique experience.


[12/19/2022 2:25 PM] cafebedouin#9837
But, then, it was changed into a commercial product as experiences people like to have tend to....


[12/19/2022 2:25 PM] liquid_phase#4605
well to be fair it didnt start out as a cacophony society event, larry harvey was the reason it became known as such, but there was a woman who started it out of the san francisco art movement/district who fell terminally ill, and larry harvey (and crew)continued the event in her memory.


[12/19/2022 2:26 PM] liquid_phase#4605
back then it was a wooden man 10 feet tall they built on a beach south of san francisco


[12/19/2022 2:26 PM] liquid_phase#4605
after a couple years and so many people kept coming they realized they needed infrastructure if they were to continue


[12/19/2022 2:27 PM] liquid_phase#4605
the entire thing was a pagan ceremony on the beach, the cremation of care


[12/19/2022 2:27 PM] liquid_phase#4605
anyway, not to derail this topic now - the general idea behind it is: if you want something large enough(to influence the entire world) you need structure to support it


[12/19/2022 2:57 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Read a different version in a book on the Cacophony Society. Makes sense there would be a lot of overlap in the SF art community, and determining who is responsible for something is open for interpretation


[12/19/2022 2:57 PM] liquid_phase#4605
My source is a friend of the late larry harvey's who was a member of the department of public works for black rock city (the city that pops up once a year and encompasses burning man, run by the burning man ORG)


[12/19/2022 3:00 PM] liquid_phase#4605
the truth is sometimes alot more boring, and sometimes romantic when it shouldn't have been

Book is kind of interesting, but better as a library book. Although, interesting coffee table book, if you are into that sort of thing.


[12/19/2022 3:06 PM] liquid_phase#4605
I'll have to look at the books - maybe the 'art movement' the woman i'm speaking about was in fact the suicide club. not sure but could be plausible. I just have a very firm memory of this conversation taking place and the story of the womans death and how larry harvey brought her ashes and put them in the fire


[12/19/2022 3:07 PM] liquid_phase#4605
coming from a friend of larry harvey, so could be embellished from him to her, who knows - i tend to side with the non-group think version of the story until it's proven ineffectual or false


[12/19/2022 3:10 PM] liquid_phase#4605
anyway, i'll just say that there are tons of similarities between nascent art and industrial movements and the crypto space, and i perceive it to be not just a new industry or medium but itself an entire harmonic of society and human progress. I'm sure we can draw parallels from just about any aspect of human organization, civilization and disobedience and see how it can be applied to this new space. but from here out, let's keep burning man discussions out of sig-chat, because its pretty derailing to anyone who's unfamiliar, i'm sure. (i know im the one who brought it up, so my apologies üòõ )

[12/22/2022 3:18 AM] crandano#0000
(re @chucked1993 : *As long as people think the project is worth putting in work to keep alive*) 
 
 I think it's worth it and if there's an event end of Jan / beginning of Feb it could be promoted. maybe Wilford or someone has ideas on creating a server for it where everyone can be anonymous?


[12/22/2022 3:24 AM] crandano#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *crandano im a bit stumped on how to proceed with utxo alliance do you have any ideas?*) 
 
 create the First Principles Alliance haha. 

no idea man. someone mentioned a Slack channel so i feel like it's a bit gated. i wish we would have made the Discord channel.

what are you thinking? seems questions go unanswered. it's the holidays, so i'm not expecting much, but you'd think the next main meeting, work groups, and discussion on how the first work group went and what they went over would have happened by now


[12/22/2022 3:32 AM] NoahErgo#0000

something i was thinking about and want to mention before i forget is we should check what crypto events are happening in 2023 and who is close by that can attend. rep Ergo a bit, have a little meetup perhaps even if it's a small person bar event. things like that.

ETH Denver is a big one and free, for example


[12/22/2022 4:56 AM] NoahErgo#0000
Smart


[12/22/2022 4:57 AM] crandano#0000
Consensus would be cool but so costly, but there's room for cheap events outside of the main event

@Sigmanauts @SigCan 

As discussed in the last couple meetings, for the next week I will be reaching out to projects and people who cover ERGO on youtube, spaces, etc...I will keep a simple list of who i've contacted and will gather it from various sources including the very detailed list that @Rishabh is currently working on. 

We will be mimicking the weekly dev update Wednesday mornings that happen in the #üõ†‚îÇdevelopment channel here in discord and the bridged channel in telegram.....but for marketing/announcements. 

**This will give community content creators, projects, community devs, and others, the opportunity to make marketing announcements in one place for everyone to see at one point in time.**

We will use #üó£‚îÇmarketing here in discord, which is also linked to <https://t.me/ErgoSocials> in telegram.

For now, I will follow the same procedure that @kushti does by announcing the night before and the moment of on the day of. 

@CW and I will then include these in a segment in The Sigma Update when we record it a day later. 

I, and others, will also use these while planning tweets and re-tweets on the Sigmanuts twitter account.

Please feel free to chime in with any ideas/helpful suggestions.

hey @Sigmanauts  and @SigCan 

I've emailed, DM'd through twitter, discord, telegram, almost 40 accounts (some of you included) about the wed community marketing updates that I wrote about yesterday (a few messages up). First one will be this coming Wednesday at 1pm UTC!

Bellow is the message I sent as well as the list of people I sent it to via which medium....

I'm sure I missed many projects either because I didn't think of it at the time or couldn't find a way to email or DM them. Please feel free to send my message along to anyone you think I may have missed.

Cheers!

[12/30/2022 12:41 AM] drehaf#0090
Hi!
Sigmanauts are organizing an Ergo marketing update that mirrors the Ergo dev updates time and spirit. 

Please join us Wednesday mornings at 1pm UTC in the bellow channel (they are bridged)
Discord: https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/668914429894721546
Telegram: https://t.me/ErgoSocials

Please use this opportunity to give a brief update on:
Upcoming news about your project
Upcoming release dates and info for any media you are producing and releasing (ie: topics covered in your upcoming show)
Promotions
Raffles
ANYTHING that is happening in the following seven days that you want the community to know about and we can help promote via our channels.

CW and I will then cover this in a segment in the Sigma Update.
We will also use it to promote by tweeting, retweeting, and interacting with your tweets from the Ergo_Sigmanauts twitter (the previous Ergo account).

Like the dev update, I'll announce a reminder the night before, and then a kickoff the morning of.

First one will be this coming Wed Jan. 4th!

Hope to see some of your marketing updates there!

@glasgowm  Couple more questions about the 20 token limit:

Including more than 20 different tokens in a single transaction can cause the ledger app to crash. Correct? 

If that‚Äôs the case:

1. Would such an event impact any other apps installed on the ledger device or only the ergo app? 
2. Would any tokens be burned in the process?
3. What should a user do if this happened? 
ie. Will it be necessary to Reinstall the ergo app on the ledger device or only necessary to restore wallet from seedphrase?

I currently don‚Äôt have my ledger on me so I can‚Äôt test these things out myself (until Sunday), but I know many people will want to move their assets to their ledgers asap and    they should be aware of these potential issues.


[01/06/2023 1:21 PM] glasgowm#0000
1. Will check
2. No 
3. Restore from seed 

Will double check with dev


[01/06/2023 2:25 PM] glasgowm#0000
Not crash but return a validation error

1. No
2. No, as transaction is not signed tokens are safe
3. Probably choose a small sending amount and/or less assets to try to force the inputs selector to not include boxes with too many tokens.


[01/06/2023 2:28 PM] notmork#0000

Hey guys, after some weeks reading/ being here I have to admit that this is too much marketing for me. 

I am not the marketing / shilling / maxi guy and thus believe I won't be a big help here. 

Still happy to help spreading the word about ERGO but I cannot keep up with the pace in here.

 "Spreading the word about Ergo" is exactly what marketing is ;)

 Sir, you don't need to be shiller I assign you a task to motivate people, are you good at that? Haha it's not about providing good outcome, sometimes small things make bigger changes :)

 I feel like things are just getting started too, sometimes the pace to keep up with what is happening around the ecosystem outpaces me by far.


[01/08/2023 7:10 PM] dadreboi#0000
Yah. Participation in here is 0% to 100%. Comes in all levels essaias. Essentially, we take what anyone can offer out of their free time. No need to feel like you have to keep up if you can‚Äôt. Throw your opinion in when u can, it‚Äôs all we can ask for ;)


[01/08/2023 7:15 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
If you don't mind me asking, what types of activities are you interested in? The program is still evolving and shouldn't be just about marketing, governance, or any one thing. We encourage you to discuss and work on things you are passionate and knowledgeable about that will add depth and benefits to the group. Ultimately, we all just care about the success of Ergo and are doing what we all can when we can, and trying to build a valuable resource for the community.


[01/08/2023 7:17 PM] dadreboi#0000

Honestly I do not prefer any "activities".

I have very limited time available right now. Think that especially limits my options. I prefer doing things right and not just 5% or as little as what time permits.

 About the calendar thing, I think we should look for all in one place features... I am seeing calendar as "announcements portal" for people to contribute and get some free marketing " but if we want to implement dates with working group, we should focus on options like notion o rework...

 Anything from a like/retweet to explaining in your own words what attracted you to Ergo helps, never underestimate what the simplest things can do - especially in an ecosystem as small as Ergo!

[01/08/2023 7:46 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
Compared to other chains, Ergo tends to be extremely humble; as admirable as that is, considering Ergo amazing advancements in PoW and eUTXO tech, we do need to learn from other more popular chains how to market the ecosystem more "loudly"


[01/08/2023 7:46 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
Otherwise we'll end up with beautiful dapps that no one will know about except for the die hard Ergonauts


[01/08/2023 9:08 PM] essaias#5787
Well... thats going to be a longer answer. You are not wrong. But I don't like the approach. 

1) I think the growth of active users, use cases and shills depend on each other. Not just in Ergo. For any grassroots project.

Bringing ppl into an ecosystem that has hardly any (real world) use cases won't be sustainable - but yet is possible.

2) Short-term, shilling might help pumping the Coin/MCap by getting ppl / to invest. But I think that in current times this is not likely to happen. Novice ppl learned (again) that crypto is bad and you are prone to loose money if you just "invest" and don't care/understand. 

The crypto space lost trust. And those who recover that will likely be the winners.

3) If you are squinting at the success of VC backed chains its obvious that ERGO is lacking exactly that VC to bring creators and marketing.

Ergo has small, individual creators, and they can not create these big rumors. 

So the question to ask is: what has the ergo ecosystem to offer for ...

A) the end user,  how is his investment safe and protected, and how can he even do that?

(Insane idea: having fiat on ramp for sigmausd and using that to pay nfts/games/collectibles etc...)

B) for creators like easy samples, APIs + Docs, Dev Support, Funding, Marketing plans (Cross Promotions)

C) for investors

 You can't have a growth in active users if those users don't know that Ergo exist though

That's what marketing/shilling is all about: letting people know that Ergo exists & showing support also proves that there's a solid community behind it


[01/08/2023 9:29 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
2) The goal is to reach outside of our echo chamber; short term pump/dumps are irrelevant, ideally we'd like new Ergonauts to stick around because they like the ecosystem

But we'll never give them the chance to do so unless we try to reach said audience


[01/08/2023 9:30 PM] FoeniculumNFTs#0000
3) Forget VCs, focus on what assets WE have that we can leverage to maximise outreach: social media accounts, our own skills to build our own projects and so on

@Sigmanauts @SigCan 
I know we discussed a little in the meeting today about a broader audience and agreed that we would mix the main meetings with the update meeting from the larger ergonauts channel...

When we first started these meetings i posted meeting notes to the main ergo platform...for some reason i switched to the sig channels after that. 

Any objections to putting the screenshare/voices, meeting notes, and transcript in a new shared folder that the community can look at?


[01/09/2023 2:23 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Oh, I'll bite. What do you think the Sigmanauts program should be about? Personally, I view it as a way to engage more fully with the Ergo ecosystem. In my case, this has meant writing for the Ergo Foundation, marketing pieces and white papers for projects, working on sigmabot, editing documentation for Fleet, etc. I do spend some time in the general discord moderating and helping newbies. I don't do much of what could be described as shilling. The bottom line is the Sigmanaut program helps plug people into to the ecosystem. I don't really care for meetings and organization, but when you get to 50 or more people, you need to have more formal systems.


[01/09/2023 2:24 AM] cafebedouin#9837
So, in short, do what's right for you. If the program can help you make connections or get you doing things you otherwise wouldn't you find interesting. Great! That's what it's supposed to be about.

 It's an IOG board, they have been active since August, still working out strategy and how to move forward,
 I'll get a link to discord channel soon, just came out of spaces with him, he is interested in whom to talk to concerning Rosen, the goal of the board is to develop Cardano Standards for chains to use to plug in to Cardano with bridges, I was clear that you were probably the guy to be in contact with, with your interest in eUTXO stuff and willingness to work with Nervos and others etc.

I'm kind of the same here, I don't do any real articles or anything like that, I just do general community moderation and I guess talk about ergo in a lot of my cardano spaces. I don't think you need a clear goal to be a sigmanaut though, as long as you are passionate and involved in the community doing something then that's still a positive

Your "just do community moderation" is a lot of work. The Spectrum group is crazy right now. But, yeah, agree. There's room for a lot of styles here. The cool thing about Ergo, for me, is that there's a lot of opportunity to do things  that you otherwise wouldn't. If you would have told me that I'd be working on a Discord python bot two years ago, I would have thought you were crazy. I didn't even use Discord back then. I think, as we get more organized as a group, we also need to keep in mind that decentralization means not only things like transparency, but also finding ways to help individuals in the group and people involved in the ecosystem to do whatever gets them excited: whether that is opportunities to code, write, podcasts, moderate or whatever they are good at or maybe don't get an opportunity to do but would like to try. I think your focus on passion is the key thing.

I just wouldn't want anyone to not apply as they don't have any skill in particular they think they can provide, just being active in the community and answering questions is how a lot of us started out in ergo


[01/09/2023 2:34 PM] drehaf#0090
The ability to help/engage the ecosystem looks different for everyone, i agree. One thing I'm seeing that us sigs need to be careful with is to not make people feel that their own level of engagement isn't enough. 

And there are nuances even there that make it extremely difficult. Certain voting proposals can be better served by the people that have been engaged in the subcommittee and main group meetings, reading the notes, transcripts, and back and forth. Having people vote on topics they have never even engaged or read about isn't a great practice IMHO (welcome to US election voters). 

But, that being said, there are probably a lot of votes that benefit from the larger community and need better representation from that. 

Honestly, it's a difficult thing to walk the line of putting in a ton of work on something and then holding a little entitlement to be part of a "closed" voting group. Fighting the urge to reject those who come in and vote and that's the only visible effort put in. Not easy to swallow, but something to be mindful that we don't get caught up in.  **Some things require Sigmanaut only voting, others will require a full community vote IMHO. **

This all needs and should be fleshed out as we continue to build up the community. We have a long road ahead of us but have been moving down it since the inception of the Sigmanauts group and with the help of many great people past and present.

Welcome


[01/09/2023 3:14 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
I think its a combination of having avenues for varying levels/types of participation & having messaging that encourages individuals to take ownership of their role in a way that best suits their talents/passions. It can be intimidating being a novice coming into a group of people you know are active and producing great things for the ecosystem, and trying to find your own place. Maybe in the welcoming/promotion messaging it can be stressed that individuals are encouraged to keep doing the things that led to them being promoted, while exploring the program to find other opportunities to integrate their work or explore other areas of interest?


[01/09/2023 3:16 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Also, @drehaf does the voting bot allow for the person making the proposal to select the individuals that are allowed to vote for it? Say if it was a committee vote that should just be limited to that group and you didnt want to bombard the larger group?


[01/09/2023 3:17 PM] drehaf#0090
not at the moment, but can be programmed that way, yes


[01/09/2023 3:20 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Ultimately, as this stage, I hate seeing people feel they dont belong in the group or have a place in its mission. Each of us, old and incoming, are just as important as the others and bring something to the table. Just because it all isnt the same for everyone, shouldnt discourage people from being a part of it...it should invigorate them to find their own gaps to fill...the question is what is the best way to do so other than chatting when someone is discouraged...how do we make this more inviting in that sense?

Welcome! We appreciate your interest in the Sigmanaut Program and your support of the Ergo platform.

As outlined in our Mission Statement, we are a community group that advocates for the adoption of the Ergo blockchain while promoting Ergo's values in the larger cryptocurrency space.

Please ensure the information in your application is correct and complete as it will be reviewed and voted on by current Sigmanaut members.


[01/09/2023 7:09 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
Maybe also consider adding something like ‚ÄúHow are you currently engaging with Ergo (e.g. trader, Dev, community marketing, investor, etc.)‚Äù to the application somewhere near "What would you improve..."?

If thats about my last message: 

I did not say I feel I dont belong here. 

Just said I can not keep up with the pace (and topics) some of you have. (And that is a requirement I set for myself if I join some group. So its my problem, not necessarily the programs.)


[01/09/2023 7:35 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
I get that. Comment wasn't directed towards you, just an overall feeling. Had some others step away for various reasons, one of which was the move towards more organization and such. Ultimately, we all just want people to do what they can when they can....some things will require more organization while others not so much. I think we are working towards a place where many of these more detailed convos will be siphoned off into their own spaces/groups as they develop, making it a little less overwhelming in the general chats and easier to browse and engage in specific topics of interest.

Honestly the name "program" tells me that you have to participate somehow.


[01/09/2023 7:47 PM] essaias#5787
Also the fact and way you "enter" that elite circle puts up that pressure..


[01/09/2023 7:56 PM] Sisyphuspush#7967
To be fair, most people who apply already participate in the ecosystem in some way, shape or form. Participation can mean many things and shouldnt be seen as a negative but as an opportunity to get more support for the types of activities you already do, IMHO. I mostly shill NFT artists & projects..so imagine how I felt coming in, lol.

Sorry for the delay @Sigmanauts @SigCan , I was back to work today and had a lot to catch up on.

Bottom of this message is a link to the transcript as well as the recorded screen/voice. 

+++++++++++++++++++
Meeting notes 1/8/2023

DEXY LOGO VOTE
- Pushing the dexy vote to early march
- Campaign to end of january, logo contest in early feburary is a good place to start. Two Weeks for the log contest.
- Ergcube for vote. sigs take on promotion and vote.
- Teach new users about dexygold (no RSV)

VOTING RIGHTS OF EF MEMBERS
- The EF should be able to vote on candidates for sigcans and sigmanauts.
- Perhaps add that to next months meeting about going into the weeds about what they can vote on or not reguarding proposals. For now, EF can vote on sig applications.

SIGMANAUT FAST TRACK
- If you want to fast track a non member right to a sigmanaut, simply fill out the form as a sponsor with the subject 'sigmanaut vote' instead of 'sigcan vote'. When non members go from the application portal it automatically puts 'sigcan vote', when we make it from our portal it's whatever we put in the subject. 

NOAH/CRAN
- Ambassadorship not going as expected. it's very top down....seems the way they are interested in colab between core dev teams and or the foundation involved. 
- Started the telegram grou for UTXO alliance. 
- Best thing they can do moving forward is reach out to individuals and build up from there. 

CRAN - Dework 
- Organizing tasks on there. can use the kanban board and leaderboard
- This is pretty plug and play so it was determined that when needed it can be integrated and ramped up. 

COMMUNITY CALENDAR
- qx() and HQer will take a look at HQ's ergcube CMS to see how well a public calendar can be integrated. 

TWITTER SPACES
- A few people volunteerd to be present in new Sigmanauts Twitter spaces (qx should have full account access soon to make this possible).
    Possible starter spaces:
    - How to become a Sigmanaut, introduction to sigs (meet and greet)
    - Start off with dexy gold. 
    - Rroesn bridge
    - Lithos

MARKETING MATERIAL
- Marcel has made a lot of material in the official repository
- A lot of it is on Figma is open and can edit the assets. 
ANGIE
- Many different listings to integrate rosen bridge into the infographics. 
- Short research for now found around 8 - 10 different platforms where we can talk about rosen bridge. 
CW
- Youtube shorts from various shows that people can quickly grab and post (10 second clips or so) eaisly to help spread word or back up what they are saying to educate others.

BLENDING SIGMANAUTS AND ERGONAUTS MEETINGS
- Suggested to blend meetings, which saw no resistance
- Sis spoke about sub groups and how they are also important
- qx() spoke about how initially he is worried too many sub groups can water down the main group with already small numbers, suggested playing it by ear to break out as needed and as congestion is faced. 

TX FEES
- qx() is interested in exploring what the community thinks and will put this on a slow burn to think of ways to engage the community

ONBOARDING
- Kill_It and qx() will get together this week and focus solely on the landing page.

[01/11/2023 1:56 AM] NoahErgo#4349
@qx() what do you think of something like this:

If a sigcan applicant has already demonstrated significant contribution to the ergo ecosystem in a meaningful way, a sigmanaut can propose to sponsor that applicant and fasttrack them to sigmanaut status rather than going through sigcan trial period. Many active community members may exist outside the sigmanauts program that already exemplify the values of the sigmanaut program, and for those individuals this fasttrack process makes sense as it allows them to gain access to governance and contribute to sigmanauts quicker.

What do you all think of hard capping our sig meetings to one hour?

Any topics we don't cover get pushed to next meeting. So we should cover topics based on priority.

I want to be extremely mindful of everybody's time otherwise people won't want to participate. Meetings shouldn't have to go over an hour.

If you have something to say let's keep it concise and keep the ball moving. Banter can wait for another time when we don't have everybody on a call waiting.

 What I would love to see is more then 10 sigmanauts in meeting.... I get it ,some people don't want to participate o don't know how to contribute, some are already busy with projects .... But we also almos 50 now... And it's always same 7-8 person who show up to meeting

 Maybe a vote for , "I am cool with this , I want to contribute..." "Let me go" they still will remain sigmanauts but we atleast have a broad view of how much man power we have

 Good idea Noah, and this will reinfoce the path that @sisyphuspush was talking about where it will leave room and time for other sub-breakouts to occur organically.

 HQ, you can team up with Cran and Chris who were looking into methods of engagement level if you are super interested in that....the questions they are asking are like: are you a sig but never want to vote? kinda thing...there is an entire operational channel where a lot of pruning and etc were discussed. lots of room for more discussion and proposals on this front!

[01/11/2023 7:30 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I've said it before but it bears repeating: communities are defined by their centers and not their peripheries. Perhaps one way to think about it as five concentric circles: people that don't use Ergo, Ergo users, Ergo enthusiasts (Sigmanauts), Ergo community leadership, core (EF). 

Someone suggested Sigmanaut Captains, I'd prefer something less military but maybe something like Representatives. Framed in that way, Sigmanauts is a kind of civic standard with some ecosystem voting right, and SigReps are kind of there to spearhead committes and various proposals to be voted on. Anyway, I think much of this discussion about who is and isn't a Sigmanaut is really about leadership and having agency, who is putting in work and who isn't. It seems a good move might be to revisit our mental model of what we want the community to look like. With values like decentralization, transparency, permissionless, it makes sense to have a low tier of being a community member, but just as obviously, someone like qx() is working on a whole other level. So, maybe we need a different word for that. There are times I don't feel like a "Sigmanaut" and I think this kind of ambiguity is the reason why. It might be good to cut the concepts a little differently.

To use me as an example, I'm never going to be community leadership. So, if that's what being a Sigmanaut means, then I shouldn't be one.

More in response to your comment about Sigmanaut meeting attendance. I'm weird about video calls and right now, the conversation is mostly about group organization, which is not my skill set. So, just trying to advocate for other ways of being and thinking about it.

I don't think that's a bad idea honestly, just can be hard to accomplish cause there is always a lot to go over. But like qx was saying, this may help lead to those more organic sub meetings

I think you prove a rather valid point @cafebedouin , maybe this is something that me and @drehaf can discuss later on this evening when we hash out the landing page

Pumped. This is a good sign that levels of engagement and involvement/belonging are being discussed! I think it means this entire process is working and slowly taking shape.

(re  : *<cafebedouin> I've said it before but it bears repeating: communities are defined by their centers and not their peripheries. Perhaps one way to think about it as five concentric circles: people that don't use Ergo, Ergo users, Ergo enthusiasts (Sigmanauts), Ergo community leadership, core (EF). 

Someone suggested Sigmanaut Captains, I'd prefer something less military but maybe something like Representatives. Framed in that way, Sigmanauts is a kind of civic standard with some ecosystem voting ...*) 
 
 Well said.

@SigCan @Sigmanauts 

Sigmanauts Meeting Notes 1/15/23

VOICE and Screenshare Recording can be found here: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AxGY_DsTx4tFWqF8wRjEfarK6oGinUKo/view?usp=sharing>

Transcript is at the bottom of the agenda here: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y8qLOIROHMNJpl8xvU01PwhnVUUU2VxMQqL03XhG-1A/edit?usp=sharing>

VOTING PARTICIPATION
- Chris furthered the discussion from last week about EF members voting on proposals as well as the agreed upon sigcan/sigmanaut member voting. 
- qx() volunteered to write a voting proposal that would not just cover this, but all large and influential groups that could come into the ecosystem. For example, broad language to allow sigmanauts to voting power as long as they adhere to the sigmanauts mission. The vote should be up soon.

TRANSPARENCY of SIG PROGRAM
- Chis brought forward some community concerns about them feeling in the dark about sigs. There was much discussion about how best to mitigate this, please look at the transcript or listen to the recording. The summary was that we need to be proactive about the different efforts that are in the Sigmanauts (full in all the way to someone simply participating in chats). If the vote for transparency and posting meeting notes public is passed, that should help a lot as well. 

PRUNING
- Chris brought forward concerns about bad actors in the ecosystem as well as actors that are both sigs and not representing the ERGO. General consensus was that we can adhere people to the sigmanauts mission statement and bring forth discussions when members feel that other members have violated these principals. 

MEETING TIMES PROPOSAL
- qx() had an inquiry about a meeting time that would be more flexible for people. He will send out a link in main chat to get a heatmap on times that work best for everyone (to get more feedback than just people in the meetings).

VOTING
- Seems to be a lul in voting this week even though there are many things to vote on. qx() will DM all sigs to get them to vote before some of the votes expire. 

TWITTER SPACES
- qx() will put out a time suggestion heat map for the first twitter space. Suggested first topics include Introduce the sigs as well as discuss what the sigs are, how to join, how to follow us. 

ONBOARDING
- Kill_it_with_coffee is working on making a very clear landing page for Sigcans/Sigs so that they can get a good feel for what it is to be a sig, he's made great progress this week. The ideas is that one could visit that page as a welcome and have a full idea of what's up, and then, can dive into the HUGE depth of material that has already been there. 

COMMUNITY CALENDAR
- HQ is working on allowing public calendar submissions that members (some sigs or sigcans) can then approve. The display page is very attractive. 

EF
- Angie spoke about some sigmanauts possibly joining in the Contribution telegram channel to help with some editorial aspects, Kill_it_with_coffee Volunteered to test those waters. 
- Angie spoke about the upcoming hackathon and that Sigs should be aware to help promote it as it will be trying for a MUCH broader reach this time outside of the ergo ecosystem.

@Sigmanauts @SigCan Hello!
Looks like vote 23 passed!

"At the start of each zoom a warning will be announced before hitting record, allowing people to change their zoom display name for privacy's sake.
No faces will be rebroadcast, only the screen share.
After the meeting, the meeting notes, screen share, and transcript will be placed in an organized public folder and announced to the main ErgoPlatform telegram and discord."

This policy will be in effect starting the next meeting (1/22/23).

I think this is a great step forward to making the ergo community feel involved with the sigs and the process!

@rustinmyeye
We are happy to inform you that your application to the Sigmanaut Program has successfully passed the vote among current Sigmanauts. Welcome to the Sigmanauts Program! You are officially a SigCan! Take some time to get acquainted with everything here.

Weekly Zoom meetings are on Sundays at 3pm UTC. Meeting links and agenda posted about 6 days prior to each one. 

As your growth in the community progresses you can be promoted (via a vote) to a Sigmanaut, which comes with full voting rights and the potential for sub/committee leadership. 

We encourage you to attend meetings, if possible, and add items to the agenda that you would like to discuss/address. We are in the stages of structuring the program, strategizing social outreach, enhancing the welcome information, exploring treasury/DAO options, and everything else, so please feel free to offer suggestions or join the working groups that are addressing these items. You can see the progress an meeting notes here: <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tlPnzewmn-fTp7BmUS3TC9UZei3dqdY4?usp=sharing>

You can see more detailed in progress materials in the #üëâ‚îÇstart-here channel.

**As a member of the program we can't stress enough that your involvement in the community is only what you envision it to be. In simple terms, what you do is up to you. Some members will be very visibly involved, some will work behind the scenes, others will only communicate in chat, there is no one size fits all. Please make sure to enjoy yourself!**

I think what you have so far is pretty solid. If I was to add anything it would be snippets from the manifesto.

Hey everyone!
I haven't been very active in the program (basically, I did only vote and annoy the people working on governance stuff üòÖ). 

I want to use the time I spend dealing with crypto to think and talk about stuff I am interested in. Sometimes that's related to Ergo, sometimes it isn't, but overall I feel like I am too chain agnostic to be part of this program. Furthermore, I only want to think about representing myself when I comment or ask questions on telegram, discord, and Twitter.

Thank you all for the great conversations in this group and your effort. Still, from now on, I want to watch the Sigmanauts from the sidelines (and would appreciate it if someone could kick me from the program in discord).

See you in one of the 50 other Ergo groups üòÅ

FIRST PUBLIC POSTING OF WEEKLY MEETING
Sigmanauts/Sigcans/Ergonauts meeting 1/22/23

- Welcomed new Sigmanauts and Sigcans: rustinmyeye, kill_it_with_coffee, cheese

- Did a recap of accomplishments since the Zoom meetings started:
    - SigmaVote app for sigmanaut voting and proposals
    - Twitter account (tweetdeck) distributed among a few members to allow for tweeting
    - Twitter account on qx()‚Äôs phone so that it can join and host spaces, which is currently being organized for our first space soon.
    - Ambassador stewardship by Noah and Cran to be mindful of outreach and interactions from like minded chains/projects.
    - Mission statement created and voted into place by sitting sigmanauts
    - Draft/Sample org structure
    - Recording of meetings and publishing in the public channel
    - Logo voting method for Dexy sorted out via HQ‚Äôs ergcube
    - And i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôve forgotten many more‚Ä¶

- Had a fairly long discussion about reaching out to other forms of engagement such as tiktok shorts, youtube shorts. Being fairly up front about the fact that a lot of influencers on the platform are young, physically and or emotionally attractive people, it brought up some interesting points. Also, Coffee will gain access to the Sigs youtube and post short clips of things for quicker engagement. The general consensus was that as Sigmanauts it is our job to hold to the mission of the group. Even if some platforms encourage stretching the truth or making promises not backed up by data, as a sig it is our responsibility to not be sucked into that method and continue to state facts based on data in our outreaches no matter the platform. There will be non sigs that will come along eventually making those videos and that will be plentiful, as it is with other chains.

- Spoke about hosting weekly or bi-weekly spaces with the sigmanauts twitter. Several interested people willing to host/co-host. First space we will reach out to invite Kras (duck pools) as well as talk about the sigs. There was a group heatmap time poll sent out for interested parties and we have a good idea now on when the available times are for hosting it.

- Lots of good ideas about the treasury. Concerns for legal issues as well as perhaps making it fully anon and or DAOs and or WY DAO LLC, many things to consider. Mark suggested the last two. Our next steps were to reach out to ergopad and spectrum to get some guidance on how they leveraged legal in similar matters. Mark suggested playing around with Minotaur and some burner tokens to get the group acquainted on how it functions, Cran said he would front that test Minotaur effort with the help of interested parties.
 
- There was little support and engagement for proposing a new time for these weekly meetings, i will leave the poll up for a bit and advertise it again in case people missed it. 

- Coffee spoke about his ergohack entry and the struggles of finding a dev, check out the video for an overview and his paper, if anyone is interested, please reach out. 

- Angie noted there were also contact info on the last ergohack page if there are any questions about the process/event.

- Angie has many articles in the pipe, one about sigs as well! Please do your best to promote and or tweet these as they come out, community engagement is a quick easy way to have a BIG impact!

- HQ w/ergcube is ready to host the Dexy Logo vote. We will start planning on the social side the tweets leading up to it. Will continue work to the best way to implement his community calendar as well.

- Coffee will start modifying the initial onboarded page in the next few weeks.

Yes sir it was a dead sub with 500 followers or something when I found it. Astroturfed the patter across Reddit and got it popular, then the admins appointed some power-mods to run it but the community revoluted and elected me üòÇ

[01/24/2023 8:39 PM] crandano#0000
might be worth locking down the subject for the weekly community chat a week before it happens, posting it on Reddit to allow for questions / answers throughout the week, and then hold the actual chat on general chat

more fun with the active communication for an hour or so and we can copy/paste questions/answers from Reddit during the chat


[01/24/2023 8:42 PM] crandano#0000
we can always field questions that we're unable to answer if the appropriate people aren't there in real time in the general chat and post them on the Reddit so they can be answered. so far i feel like most questions get adequately answered during the chats though

more fun with the active chat in my opinion and people that join the Discord/Telegram if they scroll through the history they'll see these blips of concentrated conversation around specific topics

No Reddit is the worst for outreach like that. Needs to be covert/autonomous. Crossposting generally a no-no especially for something text based


[01/24/2023 10:09 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Some groups are downright hostile. The vibe on the Cardano subreddit was definitely a factor in my leaving the ecosystem entirely.

 Spotify works well. Most people like it. You have to turn on auto download by tapping the download button, then on the pop-up hit ‚Äúturn on‚Äù.

Then when a new episode comes out and you‚Äôre on wifi, it‚Äôll auto download for offline listening

I wonder if we can get whoever runs the CardanoProxies twitter spaces to come on as a sig? I feel like they would be an amazing addition‚Ä¶ they are already a great community bridge between ergo and cardano. Does someone know them and want to bring it up? I suck at this.

I guess theyd probably find out about the sigs or already know. Not sure if it‚Äôs even worth mentioning hah.

Oh also I think I saw today that they are working on an ergo-cardano cross chain nft project. Neat‚Ä¶

 There is some nonsense regarding the funds, it was J that collected them and sent them to Stacie at the EF for safe keeping. They are being transferred to CW now. Collecting and holding the funds wasn't my area so I'm sort of waiting for others to figure it out also

 Dapp with frontend outside of wallet , as far I know


[01/29/2023 9:29 PM] qx()#0000
Similar. But more of a shopping catalogue of trades.

I see, so eliminating the address requirement, which makes sense. Although people then have to understand what they are buying, which means like an eBay style front-end with lengthy descriptions.


[01/29/2023 9:40 PM] qx()#0000
Yah. Lots of opportunity for scamming I‚Äôm sure.

Ergopad has a verification tool for their vesting NFTs now. URL takes this form: https://api.ergopad.io/vesting/vestedWithKey/{tokenid}


[01/29/2023 9:44 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Tokenid at the end, no idea why discord renders brackets that way.

Hot. CQ and or Hazy is working on one too I think.


[01/29/2023 9:54 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Yeah, I put in a github issue on the Explorer front-end to see if the minting transaction can be added to the token overview page. Seems like it should be there.

I already have a quick study of the subject of sales of the foundation and what happens from the next day in some case up to 8 days later at the most.
one-. From the maximum of the day that the wallet ergos are transferred up to a maximum of one week. At absolutely all times Ergo has an average oscillation of [-16%].
2-. Let it be directly through foundation sales. Because they sell those who receive the ergos. Because there are people who are aware of what I put here and sell every time there are ergo shipments -I don't know.
3-. I promised I would send it and here it is. No one wastes time on these things and shares it.
4-. The obvious conclusion; each time ergos are sent from the foundation, they have to be sold. When it drops more than 10% to repurchase.

make another column for BTC

clear up the main question? they think that EF is dumping their treasury with that 35k payout and it's not really going to devs?


[01/31/2023 1:57 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Or, they are manipulating the price? That spreadsheet needs the argument explained


[01/31/2023 1:58 PM] hq3r#0000
(re  : *<cafebedouin> Or, they are manipulating the price? That spreadsheet needs the argument explained*) 
 
 they are showing numbers "EVERTIME EF PAYS" there is a dump 
and it has pattren


[01/31/2023 1:59 PM] cafebedouin#9837
What is the solution? That EF should redeem every day X amount and not do it in mass?


[01/31/2023 2:00 PM] cafebedouin#9837
What do they want to have happen?


[01/31/2023 2:00 PM] hq3r#0000
(re  : *<cafebedouin> What is the solution? That EF should redeem every day X amount and not do it in mass?*)

 if there is a dev which isnt part of EF and everytime gets paid and converts into fiat... i dont see EF MANIPULATION


[01/31/2023 2:03 PM] hq3r#0000
becuase if you follow the excel pattren... you can make some ergs easily.....


[01/31/2023 2:03 PM] qx()#0000
the EF pays devs, non devs, some of those people i'm sure are part of the EF.....any of them are welcome to convert to fiat so they can buy food to live...not sure what the issue is.


[01/31/2023 2:03 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I like to start every discussion like this by imagining that the argument is valid, true premises and sound logic. Assuming that EF sales result in dumps, what should be done?


[01/31/2023 2:04 PM] qx()#0000
the EF has no funds to "buyback" if that's what they mean...they aren't buying back


[01/31/2023 2:04 PM] qx()#0000
so there is no intentional dump to lower and buy back

give me 20 mins


[01/31/2023 2:05 PM] hq3r#0000
and not solve the issue , but first we need to compare with BTC and check if it has base or not!


[01/31/2023 2:05 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I mean, I know as a fact they pay for articles, at a go, once a month. They probably do that everywhere because everytine you pay someone, it has costs. So, the efficient way to do it is to batch it.


[01/31/2023 2:06 PM] cafebedouin#9837
It's why DoD pays soldiers once a month, rather than weekly, for another example.


[01/31/2023 2:07 PM] cafebedouin#9837
So, this is about they see a pattern and want to exploit it via trades?


[01/31/2023 2:07 PM] qx()#0000
(re  : *<cafebedouin> So, this is about they see a pattern and want to exploit it via trades?*) 
 
 sounds like it, but where does the hit on EF come in? are they blaming them for something?


[01/31/2023 2:08 PM] hq3r#0000
(re  : *<cafebedouin> So, this is about they see a pattern and want to exploit it via trades?*) 
 
 main concern was"IS EF MANIPULATING THE PRICE"


[01/31/2023 2:08 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Right. Then, there is no problem here. Let them take advantage of it, if true.


[01/31/2023 2:09 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Not really. Manipulating the price would require them to buy it back at profit. If you are batch paying expenses on something with low volume, thems just the breaks.


[01/31/2023 2:10 PM] qx()#0000
(re @HQ3rr : *main concern was"IS EF MANIPULATING THE PRICE"*) 
 
 why would EF manipulate price down...for their personal bags? this is standard payroll and in this market it might be felt...

(re  : *<cafebedouin> Not really. Manipulating the price would require them to buy it back at profit. If you are batch paying expenses on something with low volume, thems just the breaks.*) 
 
 yah


[01/31/2023 2:11 PM] qx()#0000
i actually doubt all of them are cashing out their payments...the number is def lower than 100%, prob by a lot.


[01/31/2023 2:12 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
(re @dadreboi : *why would EF manipulate price down...for their personal bags? this is standard payroll and in this market it might be felt...*) 
 
 Yeah exactly, it needs to be done but the low liquidity means the impact is felt more


[01/31/2023 2:12 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
Still at the end of the day, the treasury exists to lay devs to build the protocol, nothing sinister going on here


[01/31/2023 2:12 PM] cafebedouin#9837
And if you want to argue individual EF members are watching this and trying to somehow profit, there needs to be more to the argument. And, even if that were true, they would just be exploiting the pattern this group wants to exploit. So, the only real problem is they saw it first.


[01/31/2023 2:13 PM] qx()#0000
working on BTC/market compare in a sec


[01/31/2023 2:14 PM] cafebedouin#9837
This is better dealt with by saying this is normal business ops, and if they see a trading opportunity, great!


[01/31/2023 2:18 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I can also say I don't cash out of the ecosystem. If the EF paid me something, it probably went to an ecosystem token.

they are welcome to try to time this, but as you can see from the data it pretty much follows market....they might get burnt.


[01/31/2023 2:51 PM] qx()#0000

[01/31/2023 2:52 PM] qx()#0000
ERGO has higher swings for sure. but it looks like it pretty much follows the market on a macro scale


[01/31/2023 2:52 PM] cafebedouin#9837

 That part I already know.


[01/31/2023 2:52 PM] qx()#0000
so it might be a risk for them to try to trade and dump right before an EF payroll...but they are welcome to try to time it on a microscale....

the only way to fake this is if they filled their bags with enough to get the price back up to where it should be comparitivly speaking to the market


[01/31/2023 2:55 PM] cafebedouin#9837
People cannot be told anything, so it us best to  leave them to it. If you must, point out the payroll costs and you need buyback for it to be market manipulation and let the rest ride.

[01/31/2023 2:58 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Some things need to be pushed back on, but I don't think it us necessary in this case.

EF doesn't do 'buy-backs' or anything outside sending people their ERG. Ratio of USDT/ERG the MM has fluctates but nothing profit-motivated. As Armeanio has said a few times, EF doesn't trade against the community (although sure it's common practice for most coins) 

We're also fortunate that most people take ERG and we need to buy only a small amount of USDT.  The majority are likely building their erg stack and not cashing out 100% each month. 

The monthly outgoings are also less than miners get per day so conclusions drawn aren't sensible. Not even sure where he got 'When it drops more than 10% to repurchase.' from.

OUT OF 4108 views, 605 is the highest voted category in nft awards...sooo, 14.5% is the ratio of people who voted on the awards. (qx, looks like all voting system are same, no need to be sad LOL)


[02/01/2023 5:27 PM] hq3r#0000
People voted = 64
People not voted = 436

Curious if it is me or a problem in the page. If you go to rules and to try to assign yourself the #üõ†‚îÇdevelopment role, does it work? It keeps telling me that I don't have access to that server, which may be true. Or, the link may be bad, trying to figure out which.


[02/03/2023 9:59 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Also adding .newdev to Sigmabot. Anything that needs to be added to this text? 

If you are a developer new to the Ergo ecosystem, these links may be useful:

    - Documentation: https://docs.ergoplatform.com/dev/start/
    - Ergo Appkit: https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit
    - Fleet: https://fleet-sdk.github.io/docs/
    - DeCo Education: https://www.youtube.com/@decoeducation9394
    - Ergohack: https://ergohack.io/

To access the Development channel is Discord, go to the Rules channel and assign yourself the ‚îÇdevelopment role to get access to developer channels in Discord.


[02/03/2023 10:00 PM] drehaf#0090
you're not supposed to click those links in the rules


[02/03/2023 10:00 PM] drehaf#0090

[02/03/2023 10:02 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I've done that in the past. Looking at the current version. I don't understand how to do that. Basically, I'm trying to get that last sentence to tell people what to do, and I can't figure it out myself, as it is now.


[02/03/2023 10:02 PM] drehaf#0090
that's why those linked channels in RULES go nowhere


[02/03/2023 10:03 PM] drehaf#0090
maybe the sig role can't see those?


[02/03/2023 10:03 PM] drehaf#0090
for some strange reason?


[02/03/2023 10:04 PM] drehaf#0090

‚Äî was negotiating with a publishing service to give us a discount for a press release to cover ergohack since they offered before new year, waiting for their decision, but seems that they even increased the price and i don‚Äôt know whether we need this ( in boarders of $2k) 
‚Äî was answering emails with inquiries: here is the question do we consider Indian market to attract devs? there are a few proposals ( not free ofc) but from local educational platfroms to start either a research together or to launch a video course on blockchain. if so, maybe indian geo is a growing point
example finstreet.in/

‚Äî last updates from FLUX team about FLUX - ERGO Poker Tournement
they have set up a FLUX Club room on: www.clubgg.net/

I didn't use "Know Your Assumptions" as the title because it felt a bit too vague, so I went for something more relatable i.e. Cryptographic assumptions on Bitcoin, DeFi and Ergo

Personally, I like reading Reddit because it gives you a view into communities you might not normally have access to or problems you don't have.

(re  : *<cafebedouin> Personally, I like reading Reddit because it gives you a view into communities you might not normally have access to or problems you don't have.*) 
 
 Yeah I‚Äôm trying to get into learning about other communities. I just feel I get outsmarted easily on Reddit. I‚Äôm a bit slow


[02/05/2023 4:54 PM] cafebedouin#9837
For example, yesterday, I learned that if your gf asks for a break, it probably means she has some dude she wants to bone. Not a problem I'll face at this point, but kind of an interesting detail of modern dating I hadn't thought about.

[02/05/2023 4:58 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Although, my wife goes through so much tp I joke she must use the whole roll, every time.


[02/05/2023 5:00 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Twitter seems more performative. One thing I like to do is imagine the speaker is the opposite gender, and it really gets at some weird dynamics of how men/women behave.

@Sigmanauts @SigCan 

Meeting Notes 2/5/23:

**ERGOHACK VI Marketing Support**
Noah offered to get a list of dev‚Äôs to reach out to (we can possibly use the Sigmanauts twitter) to invite them to check out the i need a team channel in discord as well as submit a proposal. 
Signanauts twitter will post daily updates from the team channels in a single post to help with exposure (assuming teams are updating the channels with progress).

**Temp Multisig Wallet**
The wallet has been created. We will send a few tests to make sure we have controlling functionality of it before putting any significant funds in it.
All users are anon to each other, will check with them in the next few days to see if they are ok with me giving the list of their usernames to one other person (NOAH) for the sake of wallet recovery.

**SIGMAVOTE**
Finishing up programming this week
When system is live again the following will occur
- Sigmanauts and Sigcans can simply bring in (sponsor) a sigcan, no voting needed, just ask Glasgow or qx() for discord permissions and announcement for the new person
- Vote weekend will occur at the end of each month
- Submissions will be disabled a week before voting happens each month
- All votes pass if there are any ‚Äúyes‚Äù votes and no ‚Äúno‚Äù votes. If there are any no votes the vote is on hold for a discussion at the next weekly where a quorum shall be had on whether to pass or fail. 

**Understanding SigmaUSD/RSV, DEXY**
Discussed that we should all do our best to understand it as best we can so that we can help out on twitter, chats, reddit, etc‚Ä¶
Same goes for some of the dapps. The better we understand it all, the better we can help out in the ecosystem
qx() working on a graphic for sigRSV and DEXY, RSV already done, dexy next, will drop in chat at some point. 

**Kushti**
Working on polishing DEXY
For marketing support there is the "Assumptions" article he wrote recently that we can promote

Very cool. I literally just learned about Umbrel OS‚Ä¶ still need to learn more. 

I just have a nice vision of all
The Ergo things in an App Store next to a Bitcoin Node app, Lightning Node app, Nostr relay, and other self hosted apps. :)


[02/07/2023 2:57 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Hosting your own server is always going to be niche. I have a hard enough time getting people to just use a password manager. Even for me, I'm not a network admin. Zero interest running Nextcloud when I can pay ocloud.de ‚Ç¨53 every three years to do it. Also, alpha software. There will be tears.


[02/07/2023 3:03 AM] rustinmyeye#0000
99% of people don‚Äôt care probably‚Ä¶

But for people that do, a small percent might use umbrel, then a small percent of those might see the ergo stuff in the umbrel App Store, then they may get interested in ergo.

Most likely a useless thing to work on, but I‚Äôm trying to learn docker n git and small projects like this too :) 

Just havin computer nerd fun. 

Although right now im off computers but I know the hyper fixation will come back around for me lol


[02/07/2023 3:10 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Be cool to put a package together: node, mixer, off-chain bots and so forth. I can imagine a NixOS version, where you tweak the configuration options to have a Ergo specific set-up.

Not really sure if this is appropriate for the Sigmanauts group, but Swamp Audio raised the issue that they had problems getting their contracts reviewed in a timely manner. I'm not sure what is required in a contract review, currently asking Marty and Lui at Ergopad about it, but thought I'd raise the issue here as well. Is helping get these things in place part of the Sigmanaut remit?


[02/07/2023 7:20 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I pinged cheese about it a few days ago, didnt hear back


[02/07/2023 7:25 PM] wombo22#5461
i would think its similar to onboarding (developers) making things easier for them so possibly something to talk about/formulate ideas on


[02/07/2023 7:26 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Lui's response is funny: the people who can write contracts is always larger than the people who can competently review them.

[02/07/2023 7:27 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Which suggests a prioritization, capacity and incentives are at least three aspects of the problem.


[02/07/2023 7:28 PM] hq3r#0000
Where are the contracts normally submitted for review?


[02/07/2023 7:28 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Also, sounds like kushti us reviewing Swamp Audio now, but it points to this bigger question I'd thought I'd raise...


[02/07/2023 7:29 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I think it is informal and kushti looks at it when he can


[02/07/2023 7:29 PM] wombo22#5461
ya maybe we can provide another route like reaching out to these cardano smart contract auditing firms and see if they be willing to take on ergoscript reviewing


[02/07/2023 7:29 PM] wombo22#5461
or any auditing firms*


[02/07/2023 7:30 PM] hq3r#0000
I think a tool where Dev can login and check all these things at one place is needed


[02/07/2023 7:30 PM] cafebedouin#9837
But, it might benefit from a process where requests get prioritized, people with the skill can go there and look when they have the time, etc.


[02/07/2023 7:30 PM] hq3r#0000
Because we always forget ....


[02/07/2023 7:30 PM] wombo22#5461
see if we can build a relationship there, costs money but an alternative choice


[02/07/2023 7:31 PM] hq3r#0000

 We can put bounties on revisions and attracts more people too


[02/07/2023 7:31 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Yeah, just seems like an opportunity here to smooth out the process, lots of possible ways to make it better...


[02/07/2023 7:31 PM] hq3r#0000
Creat a review team which is paid to review, that way people will find more interest in it


[02/07/2023 7:34 PM] hq3r#0000
Hmmmm I can add a new section in calendar, where anyone can submit , but it's only visible to a certain person "kushti,cheese etc" which can approve and disapprove stuff.. just trying to be helpful, not the best idea but it can help people to get all stuff at one place


[02/07/2023 7:34 PM] cafebedouin#9837
He's getting them reviewed by kushti, so that problem is solved. Curious, as a developer, how do you feel about a queue where you could look at contracts when you had time and/or inclination? Is that even how reviews work?

 It can be time consuming to not just review the contracts, but to understand the context around them. I don't mind looking at one or two simple contracts, but personally it's hard to prioritize looking at other people's contracts when I have so much work to do myself.

This is also a good idea. It provides a valve. If people are frustrated, a paid option gives a different choice rather than feeling stuck.


[02/07/2023 7:37 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
Official auditing is very expensive as far as I know, I think too expensive for any ergo projects that have barely raised enough to survive the bear


[02/07/2023 7:37 PM] wombo22#5461
ya thats true


[02/07/2023 7:37 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Want it? You can pay in money and speed it up. If no money, then you have to wait...makes it easier....


[02/07/2023 7:38 PM] wombo22#5461
ya it seems tough on the person reviewing


[02/07/2023 7:38 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Right. But, it does help psychologically. You are getting this thing for free, but have to wait or you can pay $100,000 and get it now, or whatever.


[02/07/2023 7:38 PM] wombo22#5461
dont want to burn them out


[02/07/2023 7:43 PM] cafebedouin#9837
As the ecosystem grows, there's going to have to be a means to prioritize if core devs and people like cheese are going to review contracts. Are we okay with projects like Swamp Audio going by the wayside because it takes six months to a year to get contracts reviewed? What can be done to help the process? I don't know what the process even is, but it looks like a pain point, which I can see might grow into a bigger problem.


[02/07/2023 7:45 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Like one dimension, how hard is this contract to understand? Who can review it? Another, what kind of value does it bring to the ecosystem?


[02/07/2023 7:46 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Swamp Audio is an interesting example because it's complex and some of the problems it is trying to address aren't technical, but legal. So, might benefit from legal review as well. But, who can do that? Same question as contract complexity from a technical perspective, but legal.


[02/07/2023 7:47 PM] cafebedouin#9837
It's also hard to judge what impact it will have on the evosystem. And since it is focused on right, actually goes against some people's values.


[02/07/2023 7:48 PM] NoahErgo#0000
(re @K : *It can be time consuming to not just review the contracts, but to understand the context around them. I don't mind looking at one or two simple contracts, but personally it's hard to prioritize looking at other people's contracts when I have so much work to do myself.*) 
 
 Yeah i can imagine


[02/07/2023 7:48 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Scope creep and whatnot


[02/07/2023 7:48 PM] cafebedouin#9837
All complex and interesting issues.


[02/07/2023 7:48 PM] wombo22#5461
basically a language and we need proof readers. need more proof readers new more people to learn the language


[02/07/2023 7:51 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Right. It's a difficult job, and not a job people really want. Do I want to review AnetaBTC's contracts, even if I had the skill? No way.


[02/07/2023 7:53 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Anyway, thought I'd raise it. See if this is something that might help us think through our role.

Have a great time


[02/12/2023 3:08 PM] qx()#0000
Hiked 6 miles yesterday to hit springs . Was great.


[02/12/2023 3:08 PM] qx()#0000
7am here and everyone asleep for prob another 4 hours. I‚Äôm still on my 10 am time.


[02/12/2023 3:10 PM] qx()#0000
Voting is good to go and we can vote at any time. We lock the app page next Monday, which we call study week. Then we vote on the 25/26 for vote day.


[02/12/2023 3:10 PM] qx()#0000
So u can wait for vote weekend or vote any time in the month after study week.


[02/12/2023 3:10 PM] qx()#0000
There are a few new candidates up since the new code implementaron.


[02/12/2023 3:12 PM] qx()#0000
And the formula is changed to any number of yes votes as long as there are no votes will pass a vote. Any No vote (so could be 10 yes to one no) is held and discussed next meeting.


[02/12/2023 3:12 PM] qx()#0000
Also. We are live with inviting anyone we want to sponsor in as a sigcan.


[02/12/2023 3:14 PM] qx()#0000
People without sponsorships use the self submit form


[02/12/2023 3:14 PM] qx()#0000
Lemme know if any of that is unclear.


[02/12/2023 3:15 PM] qx()#0000
There are a few apps up from before I shut down voting. I think someone was unofficially sponsoring. Lemme know if u r and I will bring them in and archive that vote.


[02/12/2023 3:16 PM] qx()#0000
At the end of vote weekend the script will run and close votes and post them to vote channel with ‚Äúsuccess, failed, on hold until meeting discussion.‚Äù


[02/12/2023 3:17 PM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#2653
Sounds good to me guys


[02/12/2023 3:17 PM] qx()#0000
Failed is still more no than yes votes.


[02/12/2023 3:18 PM] qx()#0000
U can request new sigcan permissions in discord from myself or Glasgow if u r sponsoring them. I will add them and tag them with the sigcan welcome paragraph.


[02/12/2023 3:19 PM] qx()#0000
Glasgow can comment on who else has those permissions u can ask to do that if we r Mia and stuck on a roof in a hotel in Vegas.


[02/12/2023 3:21 PM] qx()#0000
Tonight I‚Äôll browse the discord for any new hackathon updates in their channels and will start firing off tweets each day.


[02/12/2023 3:21 PM] qx()#0000
About progress.


[02/12/2023 3:21 PM] qx()#0000
We have a user as well that is breaking down @kushti_ru assumptions document into bite sized pieces.


[02/12/2023 3:21 PM] qx()#0000
In the next few days we should see the results of it.


[02/12/2023 3:22 PM] qx()#0000
I‚Äôll then use that to hit Twitter every few days with a new lead in and link to it.


[02/12/2023 3:22 PM] qx()#0000
Guess there was stuff to talk about. Lol


[02/12/2023 3:22 PM] qx()#0000
This is ergo, so much stuff always going on!


[02/12/2023 3:25 PM] qx()#0000
I think that‚Äôs it for now guys and gals.


[02/12/2023 3:26 PM] qx()#0000
Sis and Jennie have Twitter access as well. Can start firing away if they have time about hackathon.

@Jerry_slush hi
We are happy to inform you that you have been sponsored to join the Sigmanauts program. Welcome! You are officially a SigCan! Take some time to get acquainted with everything here.

#üëâ‚îÇstart-here  to access more channels & onboarding documentation

Main Sigmanaut/Sigcan Chat is this one.

The bridged telegrams links can be found in the channel descriptions

Weekly Zoom meetings are on Sundays at 3pm UTC. Meeting links and agenda posted about 6 days prior to each one. 

As your growth in the community progresses you can be promoted (via a vote) to a Sigmanaut, which comes with full voting rights and the potential for sub/committee leadership. 

We encourage you to attend meetings, if possible, and add items to the agenda that you would like to discuss/address. We are in the stages of structuring the program, strategizing social outreach, enhancing the welcome information, and exploring treasury/DAO options so please feel free to offer suggestions or join the working groups that are addressing these items. If you have any questions with anything, feel free to reach out!

As a member of the program we can't stress enough that your involvement in the community is only what you envision it to be. In simple terms, what you do is up to you. Some members will be very visibly involved, some will work behind the scenes, others will only communicate in chat, there is no one size fits all. Please make sure to enjoy yourself!

Ergohack VI: Cypherpunk Finance has officially started and our contestants are hard at work. With a focus on building tools and projects that promote Cypherpunk principles, it is incredibly encouraging to have such a large applicant pool for this ErgoHack. Attracting this many registrants, in a bear market no less, speaks volumes about the spirit of Ergo‚Äôs developer community and the potential of the blockchain. As the contestants dive into their first week of the hackathon, let‚Äôs take a look at the projects they are building.

Volumes look off. SPF, for instance, has $7.26k for 24hr but $10k total? Same problem with AHT. Also not sure what total volume means. Does anything in AHT/SPF count as AHT volume? Or is it only buy swaps? Not really sure what total volume is...

Some nft artists weren't happy with our bull or bear rating system so we switched it's back to like options only, few projects have same concern...
Not sure what to do...keep bull and bear option for projects of just like option? Thoughts ‚ù§Ô∏è

@BenSon15  @fredballs  @kesagape  @Roger Dodger 
Hello!
We are happy to inform you that you have been sponsored to join the Sigmanauts program. Welcome! You are officially a SigCan! Take some time to get acquainted with everything here.

#üëâ‚îÇstart-here   to access more channels & onboarding documentation

Main Sigmanaut/Sigcan Chat is this one.

The bridged telegrams links can be found in the channel descriptions

Weekly Zoom meetings are on Sundays at 3pm UTC. Meeting links and agenda posted about 6 days prior to each one. 

As your growth in the community progresses you can be promoted (via a vote) to a Sigmanaut, which comes with full voting rights and the potential for sub/committee leadership. 

We encourage you to attend meetings, if possible, and add items to the agenda that you would like to discuss/address. We are in the stages of structuring the program, strategizing social outreach, enhancing the welcome information, and exploring treasury/DAO options so please feel free to offer suggestions or join the working groups that are addressing these items. If you have any questions with anything, feel free to reach out!

As a member of the program we can't stress enough that your involvement in the community is only what you envision it to be. In simple terms, what you do is up to you. Some members will be very visibly involved, some will work behind the scenes, others will only communicate in chat, there is no one size fits all. Please make sure to enjoy yourself!

Hey @ergomergoadargo hope you‚Äôre doing well!

I just listened to the recorded sig zoom meeting from a couple weeks ago, and heard your proposal about bringing lilycnft on as an Ergo influencer. I just had a couple thoughts on the subject.

I think that an ergo / cardano cross chain nft project by lilynft would be a cool idea. Similar to what ProxiesNFT is doing :)

I think it would be mutually beneficial; drawing attention to ergo from her cardano followers and getting her started in the growing ergo nft scene early. 

Maybe if she does come on as an influencer it could be a good subject to start with‚Ä¶ how easy and cheap it is to start an nft project on Ergo.

Not sure if it‚Äôs been brought up yet, but I thought I‚Äôd mention it before I forget :)

(re @rustinmyeye : *Hey @ergomergoadargo hope you‚Äôre doing well!

I just listened to the recorded sig zoom meeting from a couple weeks ago, and heard your proposal about bringing lilycnft on as an Ergo influencer. I just had a couple thoughts on the subject.

I think that an ergo / cardano cross chain nft project by lilynft would be a cool idea. Similar to what ProxiesNFT is doing :)

I think it would be mutually beneficial; drawing attention to ergo from her cardano followers and getting her started in the growing...*) 
 
 Yes, it's a great idea
Kill it with coffee has been part of the zooms I've had with her, last time I left the zoom early, Idk if they covered the subject of her first video


[02/28/2023 9:52 PM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#2653
I think she's going to make her first video about making an Ergo wallet in Nautilus and possibly on Mobile wallet as well

[03/05/2023 4:24 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Right, if they release it for use in that way. A software app undercuts the hardware business. So, they will have to make money on their completed back end then. 

It's a POS device, which has a standard form. The innovation here is it uses cryptocurrency. My understanding is they are starting with Ergo and will branch to other cryptocurrencies.


[03/05/2023 4:24 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Also, I think their set-up is a pre-paid model.


[03/05/2023 4:25 PM] cafebedouin#9837

Gold is an inflation hedge, so fine to move into before the macroeconomic environment goes to shit. But, also need to get out of it at a reasonable time too. Much like SigRSV/SigUSD has been up to this point.

Whats up with Cardano? They are cutting each others throats on twitter ü§îü§î

The Cardano culture.


[03/05/2023 5:10 PM] hq3r#0000
@NoahErgo and cafe   can you provide me few reasons on "why ergo right now?"  For Cardano bases users .. Lets attract them and bring them  towards ergo


[03/05/2023 5:11 PM] hq3r#0000
As a soluction, not as investment

(re @HQ3rr : *As a soluction, not as investment*) 
 
 Dev experience is much easier so if they want to make cool stuff they can just do it


[03/05/2023 5:40 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Who is the target? Devs? Beyond staking, why are people on Cardano? Are NFTs on Ergo attractive to people that buy them? Financial solutions are different beast. Average person doesn't care about options. Sigmafi is probably for advanced users. Duckpools isn't fully baked. 

In short, Ergo's problem remains product, not marketing, despite what crypto moon bois think.


[03/05/2023 5:44 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Shoot, for the normal people I know, just moving to a self-custodial wallet was a big deal. Getting them to stake on Ergopad, swap on Spectrum, buy SigRSV, all of it seemed very complicated from a normal person's perspective.

 Nfts are bussiness if you know how to invest and take profit, they are outdated  now... untill we see a real utility nft collection which we only have few, cyberverse rn ergoats etc...  i am looking for a reason to accomodate cardano "not happy with cardano anymore" ... what product you think it will be attractive for them to sell and attract there attention right now


[03/05/2023 5:45 PM] hq3r#0000
funny thing is , we have never done these metrics and analysis on our own community lol


[03/05/2023 5:46 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Although, perhaps some of it is that I don't explain things succinctly. But, the reality is most people are going to need a lot of hand-holding. Moving hundreds of dollars, when you know you could lose it all if you make a mistake, is intimidating. True for me too. I'm not going to mess around with the plumbing in my house. I want someone that know what they are doing to do that work.

*On-chain Polls* (NON-DAPP CONNECT OPTION)
*How it works?
*_Simple address A & B (More wallets according to Polls Options)
Each address recieves token related to there poll option (Example , wallet A = YES , B = NO) 
_*How to claim right (tokens) to vote?
*_ErgoFaucet , discord auth..minimizes Manipulation in votes.
_*- Things to consider:
* _-*How to burn "all not used voting options" (if user votes YES, he still has one Remaining NO ) which can be used to do 2x NO in next poll
_*Front-end:
*_Use explorer api to show YES and NO token in each address, on Ergcube polls or any other option if created new dapp
_*How to vote? 
*Intregate Voting tokens into 
Ergo payment portal :
example: https://thierrym1212.github.io/paymentportal/pay.html?address=Recieveraddress&currency=YESVOTE&amount=1&ref=yes

SigmaUSD is a stablecoin built on the Ergo blockchain. It is a decentralized, trustless, and censorship-resistant digital asset that is pegged to the US Dollar. SigmaUSD is an ERC-20 token that is backed by a reserve of Ergo tokens. The reserve is managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that is responsible for maintaining the peg. The DAO is governed by a set of smart contracts that are designed to ensure the stability of the token. The token is designed to be used as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account.

 it has been written in some way I am sure, one could be written for our time, I just realized there are some items that might deflect some folks from adopting the erg manifesto, and i think it should be strengthened to further protect Ergo.

Anyone wanting to give feedback on my promotional video please send me your email, I'll send you the script once it's written. It will be a short scene of a 12 yo playing a 9 yo (both played by my kids) on PS4 while the 12yo is grilling his younger brother on what to get him for his birthday. ERG will come up. This video is primarily geared towards people already in the space. I think having young kids discuss topics that many adults are finding confusing or irrelevant will be a nice comedic touch.

Anyway DM me or post here your email and I'll send you the script. All feedback is welcome. As of now my only question I need answered before writing it is how ergo plans to handle scaling? For example, people couldn't wait for POS on Ethereum because you were spending $100 to mint a jpg on that Blockchain. What's the plan for that? Layer 2s, shardding, something I won't understand lol... please use small words. Thanks.


[03/13/2023 1:36 PM] fredballs#7488
Actually I'll just upload it Google drive and post the link... please someone explain the scaling options, whether it's on the foundation to decide, the miners will vote or what... maybe @drehaf

[03/13/2023 1:41 PM] qx()#0000
if you mean tx fees, they are what they are until a proposal is made and miners vote on it with their hash power.

 ergo has no gas, only tx fee... what he means is "if price goes up, fees price will go up too"

this isn't the eth


[03/13/2023 3:06 PM] hq3r#0000
(re @dadreboi : *this isn't the eth*) 
 
 and, we have bable fees :)


[03/13/2023 3:06 PM] qx()#0000
if erg were $500 the tx fee is still .001 erg, which is $0.50.


[03/13/2023 3:06 PM] qx()#0000
i don't see any issue for a long time at this tx price


[03/13/2023 3:07 PM] qx()#0000
If something is proposed to raise TX fees, and miners vote to approve, then it might get higher...


[03/13/2023 3:07 PM] NoahErgo#0000
In future when ergo has more volume of txes, gas wars may become a thing as people battle for inclusion in blocks. Fee markets are possible. But currently they dont exist


[03/13/2023 3:07 PM] qx()#0000
but no issue with cost at today's current  rate and tomorrows price either


[03/13/2023 3:08 PM] qx()#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *In future when ergo has more volume of txes, gas wars may become a thing as people battle for inclusion in blocks. Fee markets are possible. But currently they dont exist*) 
 
 yeah exactly...u can make custom tx's and pump up the tx fee, meaning, a miner will be incentivized to pick up your tx first, so, unofficially the tx price can go up without an official tweak if people just start including more in their tx fee.


[03/13/2023 3:09 PM] qx()#0000
if you go to grandgambit you can see that in action where he allows you to increase the tx amount so your tx might get picked up sooner.

[03/13/2023 3:11 PM] drehaf#0090
@fredballs there is a good example spoken about often about front running NFT releases....run your own node (for speed), send a tx with a larger TX fee to the wallet receiving the NFT requests, and hopefully you get in the list of limited supply before others do....


[03/13/2023 4:48 PM] fredballs#7488
Thanks for the discussion guys. I'll need some time  to digest this but not for the current script just for my own knowledge. Also how many transactions per second is ergo at and I guess that is more in line with my question of scalability..


[03/13/2023 4:58 PM] theta_decay#5677
Hi Fred welcome.


[03/13/2023 4:58 PM] theta_decay#5677
.tps


[03/13/2023 4:58 PM] theta_decay#5677
Oh no bot here. 1 sec.


[03/13/2023 4:59 PM] theta_decay#5677
TPS (Transactions Per Second) is not a useful metric. On Ergo Reference Node v.5, TPS is estimated to be a minimum of 47.5 tx/s. However, transactions can happen in three scaling layers or levels:

L0: Ergo Reference Nodes, which can be bootstrapped using NiPoPoWs proofs and UTXO set snapshots.
L1: Ergo has extensions that allow for a wide variety of scaling solutions such as Sharding, Hydra, or BitcoinNG-style macroblocks.
L2 (off-chain): Ergo should be compatible with the Lightning Network, Rainbow Network, and many more. The implementation here will depend on the needs of the applications being built on Ergo.

The general idea is that many transactions can happen in L1 or L2 and these transactions can be bundled and settled on the L0 layer of the Ergo blockchain using a single transaction. Thanks to the high flexibility of the ErgoScript programming model, many different protocols are possible, each one solving a scalability problem in a specific domain (like simple payment transactions).

The Ergo blockchain can be thought as common settlement layer for many L1/L2 protocols and applications.

 Hahaha this is great Fred. Love it when kids r smarter than adults :)

I would rework this part to be more accurate. 

‚ÄúAt least it‚Äôs not Bitcoin. The
protocol is ASIC resistant. Once it blows up you‚Äôre not gonna have huge mining farms, ASIC manufacturers are a point of centralization that can be controlled by special interests or fought over by governments.‚Äù

While it‚Äôs asic resistant per say, someone with money could buy enough hash with a gpu farm if they wanted too. Also we can be softer on Btc and still make the point. 

Suggestion
‚ÄúHey, we are ASIC resistant and energy efficient! Once it blows up , mining Ergo will be what everyones gaming rig will do when you aren‚Äôt playing. True decentralization of the network‚Ä¶putting the power back in the hands of the many, not the few‚Äù

yeah and in my opinion if anything we should buddy up to BTC especially with Rosen at some point it would be great to be known as the chain that can bring great benefits to BTC and others. i think the BTC narrative is stronger than ever with everything going on. i think with an election cycle coming up in the US, hopefully there's at least one person talking about crypto and ideas like Network States; BTC and maybe a bit of ETH will be the main scope of these talks


[03/13/2023 8:45 PM] crandano#0000
i think it needs a bit of a revamp. this isn't a good conclusion for mining at all:

protocol alive.

Game pauses.

Game resumes. Demo is angry. Game pauses.

[03/13/2023 8:50 PM] crandano#0000
but i like the idea of breaking things down to where two kids are just chatting about it. some ideas that come to mind:

what do you want for your birthday?

not USD, it's a shitcoin because X (amount of value USD has lost over the last 100 years, or whatever metric)

maybe not mentioning memecoins? or if you do something about how the kid actually cares about the future of humanity and doesn't want any memecoins

then when asked Ergo? maybe the kid's eyes light up and they chat about the pros. the Ergo Manifesto. the ability to send value around the world. 

like the video posted above for Bitcoin the average person watching this video likely doesn't know what ASIC resistance means. it has nothing about the arguments against mining or anything about mining

it's just people getting screwed by middlemen and how to escape that


[03/13/2023 8:53 PM] crandano#0000

On what‚Äôs next for the market I agree nobody knows. To get a more positive narrative I like Ark Invests work. Check out Cathie Woods‚Äô monthly In The Know videos and their Big Ideas report is always one of my favorites and the 2023 one is out on their site which covers the progress of AI, crypto (mainly ETH & BTC), wallets, robotics, molecular diagnostics, electric vehicles / self driving, battery, 3D printing etc up through 2030

And the take that US could see 2% or under inflation much sooner than expected

So many good points. I guess we really won't know how resistant the protocol is to asic until there is high incentive for someone to create one


[03/15/2023 5:03 PM] theta_decay#0000
(re  : *<fredballs> So many good points. I guess we really won't know how resistant the protocol is to asic until there is high incentive for someone to create one*) 
 
 Maybe makes more sense to focus on the energy efficiency rather than the asic resistance? Imo this post from the ergo news channel says it well: "Mining on Ergo is based on Autolykos II, a fairly launched, efficient Proof of Work algorithm.This mining algorithm is more energy efficient than other PoW protocols, and it has demonstrated that it puts much less wear and tear on GPU hardware with lower mining temperatures."


[03/15/2023 5:27 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Because of the changing nature of the algorithm, the ASIC-resistent part is the fact that it isn't just making some efficient hardware. You need something that includes more flexibility, which would make FPGA seem like where that kind of effort would be directed.


[03/15/2023 10:45 PM] fredballs#7488
So they'd need to constantly tinker with the hardware? That doesn't seem like something that a large farm would want to bank on ü§î


[03/15/2023 11:15 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I read ASIC resistant to mean the algorithm doesn't lend itself to an ASIC approach.


[03/15/2023 11:20 PM] qx()#0000
(re  : *<cafebedouin> I read ASIC resistant to mean the algorithm doesn't lend itself to an ASIC approach.*) 
 
 i think the term is memory hardening no? essentially the algo can be tuned to fight this on the fly and asic makers will not think it's worth it to continue to design and build more and more devices in the cat and mouse game....


[03/16/2023 12:47 AM] cafebedouin#9837
You're probably right.

It sounds right. But, I haven't looked that deeply into it. Yeah, no one knows enough to be completely right, or completely wrong, about anything. We all probably working on two three times a day getting it all right, tops.


[03/16/2023 12:38 PM] glasgowm#9381
https://docs.ergoplatform.com/mining/asic/

> A part of ASIC resistance on Autolykos v2 is credited to Ergo‚Äôs periodic memory table adjustments. These adjuments slowly increase the minimum GPU vRAM required to mine Ergo over time. The goal is if someone built an integrated circuit (ASIC) for the memory table today, they would likely have issues with their ASIC machine when the memory table is adjusted (increased) according to the schedule at a later date.

ASICs require a huge investment for a new algo, but there are FPGAs already on the network with fast memory. Hobbyists though as it's not profitable. See #deleted-channel

hopefully it gets people less scared with sigmafi and LP/YF


[03/17/2023 4:11 PM] fredballs#7488
So I'm thinking of another scene. Not necessarily to replace the first one, perhaps I could make multiple *if  the community is behind them. 

The second one would feature my older son playing a video game again, this time remotely against an early 20s female, attractive, unabashed advertising ploy from the days of Don Draper. He's lighting her up in Call of Duty or whatever game is popular now, I haven't actually been into gaming since N64.

When he defeats her it appears they have made a bet and to settle up she reaches for her phone and I capture her sending payment with the Ergo Mobile app. I really like the aesthetic of this app. 

We can discuss the psychology behind the scene at the sig meeting but basically I want there to be no discussion about ergo whatsoever. It is just known that they settle in this manner. And it should be obvious that they don't really know each other and that my son is a bit of a shark. When he looks at his phone to make sure the payment is received he has equivalent to a million dollars USD or something ridiculous in his wallet. 

By showing a world in which ergo is normally used in this way we are leveraging the power of suggestion.

Given how complex option can be, I think it makes a good effort to explain. But, I'm going to have to read an options book to know what I'm doing, and then, there's no market. Be cool for smart finance guys to play with when we get big enough for them.

 Dangerous is a misconception, frankly. You can't lose more than you would buying or selling the underlying. A basic understanding of leverage is all that's needed.

If you've already looked into trading options, the first thing you've heard is probably that trading stock is much safer. "Options are too risky," they say. Well, what is "risk" anyway? Are options really more risky than stock?

I use it as a daily driver. I like it. Great as a degoogled phone. It can get pretty close to stock android if you activate the sandboxes Google play. Some things you'll need to find work a rounds for, like I needed to install the S1 app to get Sonos to work right. Some things I couldn't get to work, like Notes with Nextxloud. It breaks stuff that requires excessive permissions, like forget about pairing a Pixel watch with it. I could install something like AnySoftKeyboard to get a better autocorrect, but I like the default keyboard is set for security. I was on LineageOS for several years before,  so I am used to navigating the peculiarities of a nonstandard ROM. Might be harder for someone just used to stock android. Install was easy. In fact, it was much easier than Lineage when you use the online USB install. Took less than a hour.

On a 1 to 1 basis, it's a stock replacement. It's not possible to lose it faster.


[03/17/2023 9:13 PM] theta_decay#5677
Your point is valid. Understanding leverage is needed as it's a leveraged product. It's true, profits & losses are amplified by leverage. The same is true of trading stock on margin.


[03/17/2023 9:15 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Yeah, I'm currently degening, using leverage. Not convinced it is a good idea, but I find I have to learn by losing first.

If people learned to use them properly, anyone investing in stocks would also make use of options, assuming they have access to them. Lower risk with higher rewards.

Internet is on the fritz and threw out my back breaking up wood so will just give a brief update here as I'm hobbling about. Good timing for Mothers day üòÖüò≠

Been restricted by net speed, but shifted main focus from docs to outreach. Messing about with ChatGPT, loaded in the cypherpunk video transcripts yesterday, got it to write a tweet thread and then pasted some documentation to improve it. 10k views for very little work once you've get the hang of it. (Watch out for hallucinations though!). Working on integrating our docs with it too and seeing where else we could use it - could give us a big advantage!

Hey everyone can I give my 2 cents on the roadmap? It says 2022 and beyond. Yes I know that means 2023 etc but I think some might think its not updated seeing that. Maybe switch it to 2023 and beyond?

There‚Äôs a reason for that I think‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm told it sucks to be a woman on the net. It‚Äôd be nice to try to change that somehow. 

No idea how but I think starting with making the sig group a bit less of a boys club could be a start. Small changes like no more looking for ‚Äúhot gamer chick‚Äù or only looking for attractive women on TikTok or twitter to promote ergo. 

Just seems creepy haha. I dunno. I‚Äôm in a bad mood today.

[03/22/2023 8:38 PM] fredballs#7488
Yeah so good feedback. I'd love if women and men both felt safe everywhere. I do think it's a positive to utilize an existing human instinct to drive adoption. If we want crypto to get out to the masses that includes tons of people, most who will never look under the hood to see what crypto is all about, and even some that are barely or completely illiterate right? Im not above putting something out there that appeals to a primal instinct, there is no substitute unfortunately. I do appreciate the feedback tho and want it to continue in case I put anything out in bad taste. That being said, if, big if, I can get "hot gamer chick" or equivalent to help me create some content i will make sure they understand the potential and likely repercussions, if they are putting themselves out there already they probably already know to ignore their DMs. Which is why this is probably why I'm finding it hard to find someone. Anyway, my strategy is basically monkey see, monkey do. If she uses ergo to remit payments then I can, and will too.

I don't know much about it, but I think a lot of those medications have a longer half-life and take awhile to build up to a therapeutic dose. So, you'll get some feel for what to expect on the front-end, but then have to wait a few weeks to have it be consistent.

I don't consider having someone attractive a cheap marketing trick but I guess you'll have to see what I create. Don't think Danica Patrick plastered all over GoDaddy think how aesthetically pleasing individuals are used all over media. Literally everywhere. Ideally I'd like a good personality too I guess I could have led with that.

Also it wasn't even my first thought for content, something with kids was. But certain people aren't receptive to kids and a huge segment of the male population is into this sort of thing or else Instagram models/ "influencers" wouldn't be a thing. You're problem is with the world my friend. Life on life's terms, that's all I'm suggesting. It'll be ok. When we evolve beyond our primal instincts and start mating like Sandra Bullock and Sylvester Stallone in Demolition Man I'll be the first to pull the plug on the marketing üòä

[03/22/2023 10:58 PM] qx()#0000
Honestly it‚Äôs a tough balance to even talk about. When I say ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù it can mean different things to each of us. Do I think ergo would benefit from more people making more videos and posts to more followers? You betcha.

Luckily when the treasury comes about, things like ‚Äúdo we spend advert funds on our logo on someones tits‚Äù can be voted on with the mission statement in mind. 

I‚Äôm glad we r all talking about it now and expressing our thoughts. And of course, anything posted on Sigmanauts YouTube and Twitter is always up for scrutiny and voting from all of you if there is an issue. 

And @rustinmyeye you‚Äôre good whichever Rustin shows up ;)

(re @rustinmyeye : *Yeah, but yesterday and today my brain feels scatterfucked as usual*) 
 
 just a suggestion I watched Huberman‚Äôs videos on sleep and dopamine and they really helped me out a lot - especially the video about sleep. him and his colleagues think something as simple as sunlight a few minutes in the morning and around sunset plays a major part in our cortisol/melatonin cycle and they think things like getting too much light after ~11pm are high causes for mental and even physical health. really interesting and great takes from a neuroscientist and has many great episodes in addition to these two

[03/23/2023 12:15 AM] crandano#0000
This is the ep I see he has multiple sleep episodes now. Really fascinating https://youtu.be/nm1TxQj9IsQ

He has an episode on plasticity/learning that‚Äôs great too. The dopamine video is great. There‚Äôs some people in the ecosystem we have been talking about a website for overuse of technology and how to control it. I think as applications begin to modify behavior based on how you use it it‚Äôs going to become an even larger issue (ie people‚Äôs addiction to tech). Which using tech in a proper way is obviously highly beneficial but when you catch yourself scrolling all day it‚Äôs like wtf just happened. AI applications are going to become insane. Making videos that are perfect for the viewer and things aren‚Äôt too far in our future. Pros and cons

Talk about the benefits Ergo can bring and benefits Cardano brings. Get some Catalyst ideas churning as well as talk about any proposals the projects are currently working on

Haha I've been listening to a lot of this guy. @rustinmyeye tune into Huberman and you may be able to manage without the meds. Maybe not. But there is a lot you can do naturally to hack your brain/ body. 

Also watch Limitless with Chris Hemsworth on Disney+ NatGeo


[03/23/2023 1:31 PM] rustinmyeye#0000
To say that I‚Äôve tried a lot of natural things and self help routines or clean diets and exercise routines is an understatement‚Ä¶

The first time I took the pill I realized I‚Äôve never known what it actually means to relax. Prioritize things. Use one thought at a time. It‚Äôs great

Thanks a lot for the advice guys, but it‚Äôs meds for me right now‚Ä¶ gonna see how it goes, but I‚Äôm happy :)

Yo @HQ3rr I‚Äôve been slacking on adding the podcasts to ergcube‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be able to sit down catch up this evening.

I can generate pretty good transcripts automatically when I upload the podcasts to rss‚Ä¶

If you‚Äôre interested we can start adding transcripts of the ergo podcasts to your ergcube. Maybe make it easier for hearing impaired people or people who just like reading to catch up.

would be interesting in the future to embed the wallet address into a voting NFT....if the NFT stored wallet address doesn't match the wallet address connecting to the dapp, then you can't vote. this would stop any lending, selling, etc...

"The concept of a soulbound NFT is derived from the online multiplayer game World of Warcraft. In the game, users are able to obtain high-level weapons and accessories that cannot be traded or exchanged but are instead tied to the user's account, thus they are ‚Äúsoulbound.‚Äù

Not a fan of those loan terms, do you need the SigUSD for something?


[03/24/2023 9:46 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Assuming it's the one with SigRSV and 18 months...


[03/24/2023 9:48 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Nothing wrong with SigRSV, but now is not the time to buy it or make loans collateralized in it.

Going to give away one of our best NFTs to try and make some noise. Could you guys push this tweet?


[03/25/2023 4:29 AM] Chris Ray#2713
All, 
I would like to be reduced from Sigmanaut to an "Honorary Sigmanaut", without voting rights and without access to Sigmanaut open discussions, my personal forward-looking plans should not be entangled with a branch of the EF efforts to build  out this program I believe will be a benefit  to our community as a whole and those that are interested in being a part of it, my attempt to push Exle forward should not be confused with EF efforts to build our community and I cannot guarantee that I will make decision's that do not affect Ergo as a whole as it appears that I am quite entangled in our network, I would like to focus more on Exle and less on Ergo with my limited time (plenty of people focused on Ergo), please forgive me for looking to disconnect - at this time I am unable to juggle Ergo and Exle and I need to focus my view on Exle and ensure it is a success on Ergo (it currently has major difficulties),tbh I am not really putting this up for discussion - I am leaving the Sigmanaut program, I hate saying that cause I have loved being included with you all  and have enjoyed the family experience you have allowed me to be a part of, however, there are ergonauts out there that would like me to dial things in on Exle and I must make my best attempt to ensure Exle succeeds.

Just so you all know, I am quite vain - I have enjoyed proclaiming that I am a Sigmanaut to date, and it is difficult for me to willingly give up the position.

Anyway... Someone other than myself should submit some type of vote for my proposal to be reduced from Sigmanaut - whoever is willing please do so, I know someone understands my position.


[03/25/2023 4:45 AM] cafebedouin#9837
I'm of the opinion that someone asking to be moved to emeritus or honorary shouldn't require a vote. But, happy to create one if others disagree.


[03/25/2023 4:47 AM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#2653
I can respect and understand your decision Chris and wish you nothing but the best moving forward. In my humble opinion, I feel that there's no need to make you an honorary Sigmanaut as caf√© just stated. I feel that once you've obtained it, the title is yours to bare as a mark of honor unless others disagree with me on that. In which case we could always put it up for discussion in the next meeting.


[03/25/2023 4:50 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Well, at some point, we're probably going to differentiate who is active and who isn't. There may also cone a time when we don't want someone associates with the brand at all, check out all the honorary PhDsthat get pulled. So, perhaps worthy of discussion in the abstract.


[03/25/2023 4:50 AM] Chris Ray#2713
I can be quite controversial in public\


[03/25/2023 4:51 AM] Chris Ray#2713
And I do not want to affect the program


[03/25/2023 4:52 AM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#2653
I can respect that, but I think that controversial or not, as long as you are true to what Ergo is about, then your controversy can be warranted.


[03/25/2023 4:52 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Personally, I think controversial opinions help people realize that we aren't a monolith. But, I can understand wanting to focus on EXLE.

[03/25/2023 4:53 AM] Chris Ray#2713
I thought it was worthy of discussion for sure, The Ergo brand is or is not going to be displayed by Sigmanauts.


[03/25/2023 4:56 AM] Chris Ray#2713
Let me say this: I do not want to put the Sigmanauts in a position to defend me based on my participation in the program, that would not fit as I need to get aggressive for Exle (in a sense).


[03/25/2023 4:57 AM] Chris Ray#2713
My sig disconnect allows for further growth of the program


[03/25/2023 4:59 AM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#2653
I can respect that, but I personally don't see a need to necessarily remove you from all sig activities or from the sig chat. If you choose to participate or not, that is entirely up to you. But as I said, this is just my humble opinion.


[03/25/2023 5:22 AM] Chris Ray#2713
Plausible deniability for all makes sense to me in this situation, If there is a scenario that Sigs can maintain something beyond what I have devised  I would be interested to hear about it, as it is I am just seeking to  create a buffer zone between a Ergo project and its core ambassadors.


[03/25/2023 5:27 AM] Kill_It_With_Coffee#2653
I can respect that too.

 What disqualifies you in your view? That you are working on your own projects too?


[03/25/2023 1:24 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Expressing opinions that might get people upset and reflect on Sigmanauts and Ergo generally. Personally, if someone were to make such a claim, I'd simply say that different people can look at the same set of facts and come to different conclusions. And, if it was something I disagreed with, then that the price of freedom is that sometimes people might use that freedom and ways we'd prefer they didn't.


[03/25/2023 2:01 PM] qx()#0000
@Haskell_plus 

I think there is confusion around what it means to be a sig and what that entails with holding yourself accountable to the sigs mission statement (values). 

It‚Äôs a grey line. In my experience with life and these types of things we are really only beholden to these values when wielding the hammer or wearing the gloves of the Sigmanauts.

What we do in our work or personal time is our personal preference and something like the sigs has no say over how that makes you worthy of a title or employment.

Now, in the real world, profit making companies love to put on a show about firing workers who act in their own capacity on their own time, and they r welcome to do that, but don‚Äôt think for a second that it‚Äôs altruistic.

Now you may say ‚Äúwell look at akm, he wasn‚Äôt voted in as a sig perhaps because of how he acts, what he writes online (I‚Äôm speculating), and also of course his lack of serious ergo engagement‚Äù. In this case i would point to the reasoning that there are some people that probably suspect that their offerings while being a sig would present themselves just like when they weren‚Äôt a sig (as in, they may conduct themselves poorly while performing sig duties and didn‚Äôt want to risk it).

That all said, that doesn‚Äôt mean that something someone does in their own time doesn‚Äôt have the potential to damage the reputation of the sigs. That‚Äôs the grey area‚Ä¶

I do think from a personal level your quarrel with aneta and members of aneta poking you through other accounts has moved on to personal at this point. But again, that‚Äôs between u two. It would be nice if ergo projects wouldn‚Äôt try to eat each other, but shit happens. At some point as the person posting sigs Twitter I would approach you both and let you know I‚Äôm gun shy about promoting your stuff when there‚Äôs shit posting in all the comments of either project as well as making sure personal attacks <clipped message>

@Haskell_plus 

Take care of yourself Chris I know its been a tough year if you ever need help with EXLE or anything else Sigmanauts always available to help.

Personally think being a sig shouldn‚Äôt be compulsory so if you feel you need to remove yourself from the program, be free

[03/25/2023 4:08 PM] hq3r#0000
Sad reality Is that people requiere something in exchange to help others , i personally would suggest to maybe do a "week dedicated" to one dapp or project , investigate it, use it, break it and then market it , that's the only way i see that we can really help projects rn...i Will he glad to help with all of my abilities and free!


[03/25/2023 4:30 PM] Chris Ray#2713
I will retract my disconnect words if it does not really make sense to anyone else, maybe I perceive the program as more serious than it is, but with you guy's weighing in and @drehaf detailing the neta quarrel and your all ok with it I will chalk up my statements last night to having to many beers üòâ


[03/25/2023 4:45 PM] drehaf#0090
I always try to promote taking the high road and from a personal standpoint encourage u to do the same with those types of things üòâ but you‚Äôre your own man and the one actually going through it and experiencing it. I‚Äôve also given that advice to frosty. The more work we put into fighting each other, the less time spent building products and community. Just my 2cents, which in todays market is about .00125cents.

@lexymon ,
With my sponsorship I would like to welcome you to the Sigmanauts Program! You are officially a SigCan! Take some time to get acquainted with everything here.

#üëâ‚îÇstart-here   to access more channels & onboarding documentation

Main Sigmanaut/Sigcan Chat is #üó£‚îÇsig-chat 

The bridged telegrams links can be found in the channel descriptions

Weekly Zoom meetings are on Sundays at 3pm UTC. Meeting links and agenda posted about 6 days prior to each one. 

As your growth in the community progresses you can be promoted (via a vote) to a Sigmanaut, which comes with full voting rights and the potential for sub/committee leadership. 

We encourage you to attend meetings, if possible, and add items to the agenda that you would like to discuss/address. We are in the stages of structuring the program, strategizing social outreach, enhancing the welcome information, and exploring treasury/DAO options so please feel free to offer suggestions or join the working groups that are addressing these items. If you have any questions with anything, feel free to reach out!

**As a member of the program we can't stress enough that your involvement in the community is only what you envision it to be. In simple terms, what you do is up to you. Some members will be very visibly involved, some will work behind the scenes, others will only communicate in chat, there is no one size fits all. Please make sure to enjoy yourself!**

Hey  @drehaf! In the meeting yesterday you mentioned that if we wanted to propose any changes to the Sigmanaut program or had any concerns, that we should put it up for a vote. Just wondering if there‚Äôs a way to do that? Who can do that? It‚Äôs voted on by full sigs only I guess?


[03/27/2023 4:58 PM] rustinmyeye#3722
I have nothing right now, just wondering üòâ


[03/27/2023 4:59 PM] rustinmyeye#3722
Oh and are the votes public or secret?


[03/27/2023 5:04 PM] drehaf#0090
hey! yes, only Sigmanauts put up votes and vote for them. Although, perhaps you could bring up sigcans putting motions/votes forward as well but if only sigmanauts are voting on them then they need support anyway. But yes, current pathway for a sigcan to put in a vote is to put a discussion on the agenda or chat about it in sigchat and get the support of a sigmanaut to put it in as a vote. 

yup, ALL voting is public. I don't think i made a public link for archived and current votes though. let me get on that!

What‚Äôs the process to become a Sigmanaut once someone enters as a sig can? Is it up to the individual to ask to be promoted? Is there a certain amount of time where they come up for a vote automatically? I know they can be sponsored to be voted on, but what if they‚Äôre forgotten about and shy? lol


[03/27/2023 5:23 PM] drehaf#0090
currently it is:
- Ask to be promoted and sponsored by a current sigmanaut
- Current Sigmanauts noticed that they are still here and working in concert to the values of the Sig Mission Statement so put it to vote. 
- Self applied for sigcan but a big force in the community so they are sponsored by a Sigmanaut to turn that vote into a Sigmanaut vote instead of sigcan. 

Sigcan role is to get them in this chat and or get them in the meetings, and if still interested and motivated to help after some time here, move them up to Sigmanaut where they can create and vote on proposals as well as chair some of the future committees. 

There DEF is a hole when it comes to reviewing the current sigcan list and seeing who is still active and might want to move forward. It was something that initially Chris, Cran, and Sis were looking at in the beginning, so, as a Sigmanaut you would have access to that chat to pick it back up if you were interested!


[03/27/2023 5:24 PM] rustinmyeye#3722
Yeah definitely.. sounds good! Don‚Äôt mind chatting about it here though üôÇ


[03/27/2023 5:25 PM] rustinmyeye#3722
A list to know who the current sig cans are would be helpful


[03/27/2023 5:26 PM] drehaf#0090

A lot to go through! Just checked it out. I want to see who‚Äôs here on that list‚Ä¶ active i mean. Maybe it should be pruned if people are inactive for a set amount of time. Give a week for them to respond and if not kick them with an open invite to rejoin when they have time if it‚Äôs their thing.

 sorry i'm just now catching up everyone, i hope the meeting was solid on Sunday. i'll check this out.

@rustinmyeye  definitely the lists for the program needs pruned and it can be easy for someone to rejoin. we worked on that a bit but lost wind. i think at this point it's easy to see there's some people that haven't said anything in the program for many months. not a big deal overall but wouldn't hurt to know where we stand on active members

definitely agree with dig dug, deathgripson, and Austen coming into the program. pulsars and pavel sound very familiar. i'm not sure if i know setvin. 

Ergo Education Event, very cool. is there a Reddit post made about this already?

@rustinmyeye  definitely the lists for the program needs pruned and it can be easy for someone to rejoin. we worked on that a bit but lost wind. i think at this point it's easy to see there's some people that haven't said anything in the program for many months. not a big deal overall but wouldn't hurt to know where we stand on active members

definitely agree with dig dug, deathgripson, and Au...*) 
 
 Not sure how to say what I feel about inactive sig cans‚Ä¶ let me think about it. Seriously no big deal, but should be reachable in chat. I‚Äôm not sure. I tried tagging sig cans a while back and think I got only a couple

 it would be nice to know how many active participants we have and start chugging along again on talking about getting a treasury system going and whatnot again

some new blood looking to have more involvement would definitely help. 

with Rosen coming it would be cool to start coordinating some people getting involved with things like Catalyst breakout rooms and Twitter Spaces. ideally, though, we have someone with some technical background in most of those - along with one of us to help pad the conversation (i'd hate for a project seriously thinking about bridging with Rosen having only me to talk to about the technical side haha)


[03/29/2023 3:25 AM] crandano#0000
one thing at a time for sure. i keep spreading myself too thin in life haha. i'm down to coordinate with you @rustinmyeye and figure out who is and isn't active.

you also seem like you probably have good ideas for the program in general so anytime you have them just let them out. things are still taking shape here

it would be cool to have this as a DAO at some point while keeping in mind roles for people of all various forms of involvement. which reminds me i think it was @theta_decay that said i could reach out to for questions about Paideia?


[03/29/2023 3:26 AM] crandano#0000

 Yeah for sure. I guess it‚Äôd be helpful to have a current list of sig cans first. That list is out of date and lacking new members.

@glasgowm  I was thinking of working on Ergo documentation, noticed there's still quite a few references to Yoroi and the dapp connector and want to add other information, such as what are the acceptable file formats for token minting in the Auction House. 

Is there an area that you'd really like worked on? I also have an Ergo-like Darkfi doc in mind, but not really sure what that should look like, which is why I'm taking a deeper dive into regular Ergo docs, so I don't recreate the wheel.

Also, be interested in what other Sigs think should be added. Perhaps we can add trouble spots as issues in the docs repo?

 Nowhere in particular just wherever you can spot mistakes.

Hey @HQ3rr i have an idea for an app that I think could be useful for community and I dont think would require creating any new contracts or anything

Would require an order book UI. Do you think you are capable of this kind of work or no?

We can fetch and creat these types of logics


[03/29/2023 5:18 PM] NoahErgo#0000

At base, babel fees are just paying mining fees, right? There may be some other things in terms of depth and prices. The only place I know where they are integrated is in the Nautilus interface, and the only time people think to use them are when they are short of Erg. So, it looks like a demand problem to me.

 Alot of miners are selling ergo rn and kind of doing the stupid move of moving to "more profitable coins" kas o alph... Maybe trying to fill there bags or just migrating because they are feeling like "next Eth"

There is likely a ton of sell pressure on Ergo due to 2miners doing btc payouts via CEXs. I am hoping that with rosen coming out, decentralized options will allow miners to exchange ERG to more liquid cryptos without affecting the price as much.

This is just speculation though üôÇ


[03/29/2023 7:08 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Another thing worth considering is you have a similar problem Ergopad had early on, loans are locked to an address. If I loan someone, say, $1,000 SigUSD for six months. It's locked to address. If that seed or whatever gets compromised or I have to move it for some reason, it gets complicated. Also true that there is no indication that the loan is in the wallet. So, if I die, my spouse will have no idea to go to the website and close out these loans.

 Maybe creat a physical invoice system for loans? Wen you fund , you receive ticket with qr code


[03/29/2023 7:10 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Then, there's also UI refinements that need to be made, for example, reverse chronological display of loans in debits, so I'm shown which ones to pay first, first (already told Capt. about this issue).

 SigmaFi is quite modular, I have already discussed with Kushti how to tokenize bonds to make them:
a) transferrable between two addresses
b) sold on secondary markets (maybe integrated into SigmaFi UI itself)?

This won't require any contract changes, but I am waiting for loan offers to be reviewed by Kushti before tackling this feature.

You guys tell me if this is an awful idea but just a thought

my mind is always running


[04/01/2023 5:55 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
What if Ergo ran a 10k NFT collection for a t1 CEX listing funding instead of an ergo raffle


[04/01/2023 5:55 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
that way people get something in return and arent just donating


[04/01/2023 5:58 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
10k NFTs at say 20 ERG each = 200k ERG if sold out. If people like Dan, Joe and Kushti ran this I think it would be successful. However, they'd have to agree to it of course. I think the community would get behind it.


[04/01/2023 6:00 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
My artist can actually do 10k NFT generation for a good price if I could just get paid back (would take 0 profit). Could be simple art like Ergo logos/sigmanaut logos etc.

I have an idea.

Ergo community, tell me if you think this is possible/would you support it.

Ergo Tier-1 CEX funding event.

10k NFT collection (Ill arrange the art and everything).

20 ERG each = 200k ERG if sold out.

ALL profits go to the EF for T-1 CEX funding.
Twitter


[04/01/2023 6:14 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
@Armeanio @Dan - Cardano @kushti I'm happy to take care of everything with the art etc. Can even send the Lilium guys the files and they can connect EF treasury wallet so there is full transparency and 0 need to trust me with any funds.


[04/01/2023 6:14 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
What do you guys think?


[04/01/2023 6:15 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
It would also be the first ever 10k collection on Ergo and a noteworthy one.

        I would need to ask the exchange tbh.

It would give transparency to the listing costs and that is something they put me in a legal chokehold to directly discuss with anyone beyond the EF.


[04/01/2023 6:21 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Thats fair. Thats really annoying >.<

[04/01/2023 6:23 PM] Armeanio#0000
I just don't think an exchange is going to allow that to fly let's see. 

Usually the cost is generally listed under "marketing packages", that are tiered, different Tiers offer marketing benefits and listing pairs etc.


[04/01/2023 6:24 PM] Armeanio#0000

Because no casual investor will ever use something more than an app on their phone

[04/01/2023 6:48 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I can understand that and believe me my motives are not price based at all. I just have the opinion of accessibility is almost more important than anything else. Appealing to the casual is really important. All of this tech is amazing but if no one uses it, then thats a big issue right. Once people learn about Ergo, they fall in love with it. However, we need visibility and accessibility to get people to learn about Ergo. So many casuals will never use a DEX/bridge and I think its important to onboard others who arent just die hard crypto enthusiasts.

Raffles are a bit different because you get nothing in return. We could get these NFTs verified on Skyharbor. It could really be a sig effort and with some marketing it can be done. AnetaBTC sold out 4444 NFTs on Ergo and I think we could do the same with really good marketing campaigns.

[04/01/2023 7:11 PM] Armeanio#0000
They want to take fees.

Exodus in the past said if you sustain top 100 then we will add you.

We're going to be giving away a really nice mage champion to one person to who participates tomorrow.

This is for the good of Ergo.

It takes an entire community folks!

I haven't read that particular book. But, a bit on general systems thinking. What kinds of tools are you interested in? For example, you might frame it in terms of life cycles, creation/adoption curves, general ideas of ecosystem/tech development that might be extended to the space, etc. Lots of ways to bring a systems perspective into play. But, the limiting factor might be trying to figure out where we have agency and can influence the system in some positive way. Like, if we come up with a systems map of pieces of infrastructure that is needed, how do you help that happen? Is just having a list enough? Maybe a list is limiting and would frame perspectives in a way you might not want. Etc. Real rabbit hole there.

        Good point about creating limitations. Perhaps several models would be needed. I was imagining a model would help this group identify the levers it could actually pull, and then make sure it pulled the right ones.

Nice one! Also available here a bit more structured.

Would be good to set up a proper integrated qualitative model for Ergo but a bit harder due to the nature of crypto + McNamara Fallacy 'Making the measurable Important, instead of making the important measurable.' Need to improve our analytics.

@koutelier 

> I'm Roy from Coinstore, one of the fastest-growing CEX exchange based in Singapore.

As a Cardano enthusiast myself, I'm also part of the investors of Ergo for a year and I am excited about this emerging POW blockchain that is secure with a lot of similarities with Cardano using Haskel language. 

As such,  one of my personal goals in Coinstore is to be able to see more tokens from Cardano ecosystem to be listed on our exchange.

The cool thing about Coinstore is we are very dedicated to assisting every project, catering to your specific requirement during the period of listing. We are also active in attending several crypto & exhibitions this year and I be excited should your project can get promoted during these events.


Looks like it might be legit? Maybe they‚Äôll just list you for the fees. Ranked #46 on coingecko

        You can dm @ErgoMonitor_bot and start privately tracking addresses, for example to get a notification when you receive your reward from a mining pool etc. It's the same concept as the not-working-anymore Ka-Ching bot.


[04/03/2023 7:06 PM] Pulsarz#0000

This was a great tool we were sad to see sunset. But thanks to @Niccckkk8643 it is back in action! 

Send or receive a tx, boom, telegram lets you know. Very handy to keep track of #Airdrops , @ErgoTipperBot , and other tx's without checking the mempool!

hi...i am new to systems...was wondering where i can link to new persons and people to assist my navigation of learning...i do seem lost...and the real world on this site seems daunting...i would like to see a learning curve created to assist starters like me...


[04/04/2023 1:37 PM] rustinmyeye#3722
Wow busy in here‚Ä¶ hi new sig cans!


[04/04/2023 1:52 PM] drehaf#0090
Hey ridge! at the very basic level the sigs are about promoting, supporting, and advancing the mission of  Ergo. On the #üëâ‚îÇstart-here webpage that it links to there are ideas of how you can help out if desired. Otherwise, most people continue to do what they were doing! If you come to a Sunday zoom you can listen in and contribute there. I recall your interest was drumming up support for Ergo outside of telegram, discord, twitter. I think a lot of people would love to hear your ideas on that. @WilfordGrimley was very interested in that as well!


[04/04/2023 2:05 PM] asspects#3609
hi...thanks for getting back to me...seems i cant open start here painted in blue...just goes to a white page and sits there...nothing...so i desire to learn how to communicate in systems...i seem to perhaps need a cell phone for some links to be established which i hope i can overcome as i dont have a cell at this time...i come from an old school system when they did not exist...and u seem to know me as ridge...i feel asspects is better at this time...but dont understand difference here...can u explain...do i dm different people to commuciate to them or continue some where else...lots to learn...


[04/04/2023 2:14 PM] drehaf#0090
sounds good, will call you asspects! discord is essentially allowing many chat rooms stuck together that focus on a specific topic. This discord server is for Ergo, there are hundreds of thousands of other discord servers that you can join as well. in this medium you can call yourself whatever you like! you can talk to all sigcans and sigmanauts here in this channel!


[04/04/2023 2:15 PM] drehaf#0090
on the left hand side you will see the #üó£‚îÇgeneral channel, that's the MAIN public ergo chat thread that most new and old users will see and chat in.


[04/04/2023 2:18 PM] fredballs#7488
A lot of us are in this boat, there is a taiga project management page Glasgow just started and the idea is to fully complete everything in there with description and perhaps link it to published articles to help people trying to get up to speed, that being said a lot of it falls on your own motivation, there isnt a lack of content there is an abundance. Have you read everything on Medium, on ergo platform, the articles? Here's a few.

[04/04/2023 2:24 PM] drehaf#0090
glasgow is great isn't he! feel free to email me if you want to communicate there too, that email account is on my mobile so i get notified now when you send.


[04/04/2023 2:25 PM] drehaf#0090
also, @asspects do not answer direct messages. that means people who message you outside of these group chats were everyone can see it...they are 99% of the time, scams, pretending to be someone they are not.


[04/04/2023 2:25 PM] fredballs#7488
@AngieHar actually I guess the better question is, is there anything posted to medium that isn't covered in the ergoplatform blog posts??


[04/04/2023 2:36 PM] AngieHar#0000
here is a medium page 
https://medium.com/@ergoplatform

for now there is no unique content that you can‚Äôt find in the official blog on the website because the main focus is to increase the website ranking in google search for the long-term 
and because we don‚Äôt have an in-house writer so the process is more tough in such conditions ( the schedule, editing and etc.) 
however, now it‚Äôs time to recover the medium process and we already updated startegy for medium, and are planning a new topics
if anyone has an idea in regards to topics, please feel free to share and discuss, we can put them in the pipeline

i dont understand dm...why cant i answer there..i do see that said 99 are lieing...that is sad...that may be why i am not recieving commucication in that area...also i confuesed in ergoplatform over the top of my head...i am seeing ,for the future...a system created for beginners to establish a teaching of direction ...so far i feel it is for more advanced people...there are a lot of words used that are new to older people like me who want to engage but are put off by these words that most people of knowledge/younger take for granted...so seeing the age challange as a doorway to a new perspective in giving knowledge to those who are totally new and have resisted change...i know that i am saying things that have may not be appreciated and i am sorry if i have offended...most people from my generation dont belive in crypto...so i want to allow/establish  a new door to be created...for the people with cold feet..so to say...

[04/04/2023 2:44 PM] drehaf#0090
sorry, DM means direct message. scammers will message you directly outside of this group chat and pretend to be someone else. most things should be out in the open in here with no issue, correct. i can suggest some videos on discord for you to watch on youtube to give you a better idea on how to communicate here with us? email is fine as well! and in person on the weekly zooms if you are comfortable with zoom is good too!


[04/04/2023 2:45 PM] asspects#3609
i am good at many things...and perhaps knowing that i can assist others and bring then into loving crypto would be a great goal...

        I've been working on getting some clarity on the implementation so I can write up some docs for sigmaO. It's a bit irregular, so we need to chat a bit more. But hoping to put something together soon.

All ErgoTokens data comes from the Ergo Explorer v0 and v1 APIs.
I don't quite understand what you mean by: "total holder" of coins. The endpoints for each case are included in the code.

For example: comet token ...how many address hold the coin


[04/05/2023 11:07 AM] hq3r#5569
Are this type of  metrics available?


[04/05/2023 11:22 AM] LADOPIXŒ£L#6072
I don't think it exists.
Although it seems to me that the API changed since I used it for ergotokens, this you need does not exist on an endpoint. I think a bit of playing around and recording transactions and wallets can do it.

951 is the total holders in this case¬ø? its cypx tokenid


[04/05/2023 11:30 AM] Luivatra#9076
no 951 is the total number of utxo's holding cypx


[04/05/2023 11:30 AM] Luivatra#9076
sadly someone could have cypx dust in his wallet


[04/05/2023 11:30 AM] hq3r#0000
and total address holding , how can i check that :/


[04/05/2023 11:31 AM] Luivatra#9076
look at the address of each utxo to generate a unique address set, and call the endpoint again if it has more than 500 utxos


[04/05/2023 11:31 AM] Luivatra#9076
it takes offset and limit query parameters


[04/05/2023 11:31 AM] Luivatra#9076
think max for limit is 500

[04/05/2023 11:39 AM] Pulsarz#0000
That gives you total amount of tokens held tho, not the count of addresses


[04/05/2023 11:40 AM] Pulsarz#0000
But you can use that to calculate current mcap and fully diluted mcap


[04/05/2023 11:41 AM] Pulsarz#0000
You still have problems tho


[04/05/2023 11:41 AM] Pulsarz#0000
For ergopad all supply is in sc for staking rewards and a lot of users their ergopad is in staking contracts aswell


[04/05/2023 11:41 AM] Pulsarz#0000
So current mcap not possible only fully diluted mcap from those metrics

[04/05/2023 11:57 AM] hq3r#0000
He will find a way, meanwhile will add the total tokens in p2pk address metric so people can see the numbers and also total minted

Not sure to do that on main dashboard or creat collapsable with "more details"

[04/05/2023 5:09 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
Not that I'm aware of anyway


[04/05/2023 5:09 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
But Rosen is still likely at least a few weeks away to get out of beta so it may just all release together I hope


[04/05/2023 5:15 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Anybody else here have ada to contribute to an erg/ada LP on cardano side?


[04/05/2023 5:18 PM] cafebedouin#9837
How much liquidity is needed initially, do you think?


[04/05/2023 5:19 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
As much as possible always really


[04/05/2023 5:19 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
But probably going to be slow adoption with adding huge liquidity with Rosen bridge at the beginning I'm assuming until it's been tested for awhile


[04/05/2023 5:20 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
At least that's what I'm expecting initially


[04/05/2023 5:21 PM] NoahErgo#0000
May be profit opportunity for people. Some may buy erg at a premium


[04/05/2023 5:24 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I don't own any Ada at the moment. But, if AHT pops, I might pick some up to add to the LP. That will be in Spectrum?


[04/05/2023 5:24 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Catdano side. So either Cardano spectrum or another Dex.


[04/05/2023 5:25 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Presumably we'd wait for Spectrum?


[04/05/2023 5:31 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Depends on timing i think


[04/05/2023 5:31 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Would rather get liquidity started and then migrate if it takes a while for spectrum


[04/05/2023 5:32 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
Fingers crossed we are ready before full launch


[04/05/2023 6:06 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000

ok, i really missed that. if there is no agreement I hope CW still puts up a reply correcting the wrong interpretations.


[04/05/2023 8:19 PM] essaias#5787
I watched it, unbiased, and I think its no simple fud. 

its incomprehension, same that has already been shown around EIP37 by some miners: smart contract "emitting" mining rewards. 

(plus some other stuff that is not wrong but just interpreted in the worst possible way)


[04/05/2023 8:30 PM] qx()#0000
> (re  : *<essaias> I watched it, unbiased, and I think ...*)
         
        sure, it's incomprehension but also with the inability or desire to learn and correct. which is why he's where he is and not a member of ergo in the these early days. He does not want anything other than the narrative he is projecting, even playing the victim the rest of the day for "just statin my opnion man, doesn't make it wrong..."....well, yes, opinions can be wrong and are so quite often. 

Really, he has an open invite and he won't show until he's done some backpedaling or not at all.


[04/05/2023 8:30 PM] Pulsarz#0000
> (re @HQ3rr : *If u bot doesn't find them, u r fired*)
         
        I missed it because explorer is so slow. It hit the mempool, bot waited 30 seconds and it was still not in explorer sigh. Will change it to 120s.


[04/05/2023 8:30 PM] qx()#0000

        perhhaps the next set of info graphics can clear up some of those things in a simpler language.

Yeah a lot simpler. Having advanced tech does not mean we win if nobody understands and uses it. If they think they are scammed, they are gone
 Even if no such thing ever happened.


[04/05/2023 9:00 PM] Pulsarz#0000
All working now. Just need to figure out a way to not use explorer to deserialize the registers, but I have an idea.

        Yeah you are right, it has taken too long, just need to get it sorted now


[04/07/2023 12:10 PM] Setvin#2532
what requirements are needed for a coin to bridge to ergo? Im assuming its a lot of work no matter what coin you pick


[04/07/2023 12:10 PM] Setvin#2532
Are there some coins that are inoperable and incapable of bridge between each other?


[04/07/2023 12:13 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Need a multi-sig wallet and to set up the bridge infrastructure to work with new chain. Once shown to work on Cardano, it should be relatively easy to extend to others.

[04/07/2023 12:18 PM] Setvin#2532
that structure of the coin is relevent isn't it?


[04/07/2023 12:18 PM] Setvin#2532
like if you just took a random cpu coin would that even be interoperable at all?


[04/07/2023 12:18 PM] Pulsarz#0000
yes


[04/07/2023 12:19 PM] Pulsarz#0000
if they have multisig support which most do in some form


[04/07/2023 12:19 PM] Setvin#2532
so all you need is multisigsupport?


[04/07/2023 12:19 PM] Setvin#2532
is that called any thing special


[04/07/2023 12:19 PM] Pulsarz#0000
most work will be the connector I guess (pulling data from their explorers, parsing, validating etc)


[04/07/2023 12:19 PM] Pulsarz#0000
> (re  : *<Setvin> so all you need is multisigsupport?*)
         
        its just a multisig wallet


[04/07/2023 12:21 PM] Pulsarz#0000
afaik even Monero has multisig wallets :)

        connector also includes using the multisig wallet etc, interacting with them is probably a decent chunk of the time needed


[04/07/2023 12:23 PM] Pulsarz#0000
but you only need to build 1 base EVM connector and can reuse most of it for other EVM chains I'd assume

        Yeah exactly, they are all probably extremely similar, if not clones


[04/07/2023 12:32 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Well, there are other pieces. Oracles, you probably have to set a different set of  guards/verifiers for each chain, etc.


[04/07/2023 12:34 PM] Setvin#2532
evm is compatible with ergo?


[04/07/2023 12:35 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
Not at all


[04/07/2023 12:35 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
Completely different models


[04/07/2023 12:39 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Also unclear how the cross chain will work. Does all the bridged tokens on ETH need to be minted before hand? No idea.


[04/07/2023 12:42 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
Need @mhs_sam to confirm this but I would assume so since the tokens are going to be locked in a multisig wallet so can't be burned/minted as needed?

        Fair, but tvl is not an accurate label. Should state depth of liquidity, if you're only stating lp value.


[04/07/2023 3:21 PM] theta_decay#0000
Tvl would be staking plus lp. So around $1.2m


[04/07/2023 3:21 PM] hq3r#0000
That's creats another m√©tric for non Stake coins

        I agree with Lui, lp is value locked on spectrum. Lp should be attributed to spectrum tvl.

        If it's up to me, I remove "total burned" & "current supply". Replace those two with circulating supply. So you have total supply & circulating supply. That info is more important imo.

i can't remember if this was posted but just some insights into tweet rankings. doesn't seem to be anything we don't know (ie don't use too many hashtags). i didn't know that an image/video attachment is a 2x boost though https://twitter.com/NFT_GOD/status/1641914923826462721

Here is exactly how your tweets are ranked

Found this in the algorithm code

The tweet's like count is the biggest impact. 30x the impact of replies.

Next is retweet count. 20x the impact of replies

Post something offensive? Tweet is dead in the water

Multiple hashtags?‚Ä¶

        Element is just the client I thought. Not sure what this is. Hosted servers? 

We're on the main matrix server. Wilford was wanting to set up a self hosted one.

        i've been thinking a lot about pursuing local meetups but it is really hard sometimes to work people into a mindset where these things make sense. same with AI, i'd like my local community more aware. it's crazy to me still how many people are unaware how quickly things are changing - even just awareness on scams that are coming (mocking people's voices, avatars that mimic people so video chats can be abused, deep fakes, etc)

        it was a requirement for Ergo and we used the same approach on Cardano (we could do mint/burn on cardano howerver)
for other chains, we'll do mint/burn in most cases so no need to mint all of the tokens at first. note that their wrapped version will be minted at once on Ergo anyway.

        On any chain, we need a wallet that is protected by the majority of guards, say a multisig wallet.
there are several ways to do that though:
- like what we did on Ergo, there could be a multisig contract (p2s address) that requires (k,N) sigs
- like what we did on Cardano, there could be single sig wallet (p2pk address) that its key is secret-shared between guards. So what you see that the txn level is a simple transfer from a p2pk address. This approach can be used in any chain that uses ecdsa or eddsa signatures.
- another approach is two use ready-to-use multisig wallet. Say for Bitcoin we probably can use multisig Electrum wallet. Or sth like Gnosis Safe on Eth.
- another approach could be using protocol level multisigs if a chain is supporting it.

We're still in the research and feasibility study state for Bitcoin and BSC and did not chose what we'll do with them. Some tests have been done and we'll choose one of this approach for new chains.

@mhs_sam  if i transfer some ergs throw Bridge rn, i Will recibe rerg on other end? Are Rerg minted on Cardano and available on Any dex to swap to Cardano native tokens? O not yet


[04/07/2023 10:43 PM] mhs_sam#0000
adding a new chains requires:
- developing chain scanner: a module that monitors a chain for certain events, like receiving funds at an address.
- developing chain extractor: a module that fetchs the data and makes it understandable for Rosen.
- tx agreement module: a module that guards will use to reach consensus on the validity of an unsigned txn
- multisig module: a module that guards will use to multi sign an agreed upon unsigned txn.

that's almost it.

        you'll receive "RstERGvTest" which is a test token and is worthless. Later you'll receive sth like rsERG which is registered in Cardano token registry and we'll list it on Cardano Dexes.

        having a bootstrapping reserve is one of the options. as I said, we're still testing things on EVM chains and nothing is concluded.

        I understand, just thinking out loud :)


[04/08/2023 9:02 AM] lexymon#9100
I can‚Äôt participate in the zoom meeting tomorrow so here are some bullet points:
-    Invitation sprint on zealy (formerly known as crew3, they just rebranded) for the next two weeks, starting Monday 
-    I held back promoting it before the sprint starts to prevent potential ‚Äúfront-runningg‚Äù, maybe to start sharing the infographic on Sunday would be okay?
-    How it works: in general, all quests give you XP, you can level up and climb the leaderboard, for a sprint you can set duration and select quests which only count for the sprint leaderboard
-    1st sprint: Focus on invitations / friend referrals
-    Aim: increase user base of the ergo zealy community and see how the ergo community will except a platform like this


[04/08/2023 9:02 AM] lexymon#9100
-    Each invite is ‚Äúworth‚Äù one quest to claim and 100 XP, up to 10 invites
-    Additional quests for 15 and 20 invites (100xp), daily connect quest worth 25xp to incentivize daily usage
-    Problem: too many quests clutter the dashboard, but it can‚Äôt be done in another way
-    Potential problem: user creating multiple accounts to invite themselves (indication would be many evm address-users since you can login either with discord or metamask and its easy to create a new wallet)
-    Solution: none? Invited Users have to claim one quest for an invite to count, but that‚Äôs an easy task. Could deactivate all easy quests for the time of the sprint but its kind of counterproductive to let people get familiar with the platform


[04/08/2023 9:02 AM] lexymon#9100
-    Potential problems: might be too many members with same amount of XP after the 2 weeks
-    Potential solution: rewards are distributed among the top 10 of the leaderboard, can be further adjusted (not ideal, but disclosed in the ‚Äústarting quest‚Äù)

-    Sponsored rewards: 13k ergopad, 25k paideia, ?k cypx, 4 nfts for the top4 (cyberverse, cyberpunk, ergo champions, itisabubble)
1st Place: 5k ergopad + 10k Paideia + Cyberpunk NFT
2nd Place: 4k ergopad + 7k Paideia + CyberCitizen NFT
3rd Place: 3k ergopad + 4k Paideia + Ergo Champions NFT
4th Place: 1k ergopad + 500 Paideia + It Is A Bubble NFT
5th-10th Place: 500 Paideia


[04/08/2023 9:02 AM] lexymon#9100
-    1st place rewards are worth ~100 USD, so quite juicy imo
-    Cypx rewards will be ~25 usd and not sure yet how to allocate it. Maybe pimping rewards for 5-10th place with it?
-    Concerning the behavior of semi-‚Äúofficial‚Äù/highly influential persons within the ecosystem: maybe better to hold back with referral links? Instead, just share the event and promote the platform. What do you think?


[04/08/2023 9:02 AM] lexymon#9100
-    In the future we can have more sprints with different topics. Can be educational, can put focus on content creation, social media engagement, on a certain project launching on ergo, or whatever comes to mind. Please contact me if you‚Äôre interested in using the zealy platform for this purpose or if you want to help managing it 


-    created donation quests with a bit complicated verification process (but that‚Äôs the only way I could think of verifying a tx through this platform) in 4 categories (for shrimps, fish, sharks and whales: 5, 25, 100 and 1000 erg). So every Ergonaut can contribute to the prize pot to fund future sprints and special quests which focus on content creation (i.e.: ‚Äúcreate a YouTube video/medium article/twitter thread/etc, and get some erg as reward for it). Thought about creating a raffle for the same purpose

-    Considering to turn the prize wallet into a multisig one (maybe 2-3 keys in the hand of Sigmanauts?) so I cant rug (üòâ), to increase trust and the likelihood of actual donations to happen

@AngieHar @glasgowm Any idea how to embed images on my end, so when shared it automatically shows the image and not icon o it's only available in premium ?

Do you want to embed a link?


[04/08/2023 10:07 AM] hq3r#0000
Onces you share a link, images of that blog post pop-up automatically .... Not sure why it isn't same with static pages


[04/08/2023 10:08 AM] AngieHar#0000
Hmm 
Maybe the reason in the website itself


[04/08/2023 10:08 AM] AngieHar#0000
The website should have a cover

Most of the people had totally normal responses, asking questions or saying they didn't think something was correct. But almost all ignored the main point of the thread, as well as the most critical point about cardano.

I think the important thing to remember when we r out there is that we don‚Äôt have to put something down to elevate ourselves. Ergo doesn‚Äôt need that and can hold its own.

        reminds me i was going to make a post a while back and this is what i had written. needs worked on but maybe we could make some sort of community standard / guide on communication. this isn't in relation to Tim's post really. this was more sparked by a Reddit thread that was poorly executed about Rosen in i think an Ethereum subreddit with a ton of cringey replies. this is what i had:

Noticing community member's replies on some posts like Reddit really makes me think about how we need to be aware of how to communicate effectively. Note: I think the intention is correct. The excecution needs work.

While I love the enthusiasm from people to create posts and reach out to other ecosystems, I would like to make some suggestions for us to think about (while knowing we are all individuals and can definitely do as we please)

My suggestion would be to stop thinking we are better than other projects and start realizing that the crypto ecosystem should be united. Stop throwing shade. Attend other project's online and physical meetups. Everyone is doing wonderful research. Learn. Nerd out about crypto. Don't be pushy about Ergo and try to really hear people. You will learn that other projects have a lot to offer as well. 

We are a grassroots led community. Get people interested in how Ergo can help them accomplish their goals, and try to think of ways other projects can help us accomplish our goals. 

If you think there's things in the ecosystem that need to be more simply explained then you just found a gap where you'd be useful in the community. Articles, videos, infographics, and kind conversation will help out a lot. If you're new or unsure about anything then ask questions. Dive into the docs. If you're thinking about programming then jump in and seek guidance. If you're an artist the various art forms are som <clipped message>

        /t 1000 love it. Well said!


[04/09/2023 8:37 PM] crandano#0000
the replies i see sometimes on social posts are just sad sometimes lol. so many times i've seen comments about how oracle pools are just vastly superior and don't require a token like Chainlink etc on a post that has nothing to do with oracles (and usually something to do with Ethereum with no mentions of Chainlink previously in the thread). 

and the real question is if it's vastly superior then why can't this chain you're shit talking to utilize the oracle pools right now? 

yes, we are united by great research and new ways to do things on Ergo. let's nerd out about it in a passionate way and stop alienating people in the space.

So idk no risk or economic activity creating interest or yield ect just printing more tokens.


[04/09/2023 9:13 PM] Armeanio#0000
Basically its staking for more tokens, but inflation is participation based? I think anyway idk never really dug into it.

(re @NoahErgo : *If he wants to make it he should*)
        
        For sure, I look at it as free marketing. Bringing degens in isn‚Äôt bad, degens become adopters within the ecosystem. Especially this ecosystem where it is inviting and easy to become helpful, learn, and make an impact. Degens are degens until they learn value. Then become great grassroots marketers themselves. 

That said, I‚Äôm not interested in using it, but also we (Ergo Community) are a tiny percentage of the crypto market, and marketing to that larger % would be smart. Not all products need to be made for us. Lol.


[04/09/2023 10:21 PM] Pulsarz#0000
We may not like it, but having such a thing will lure more degens into our ecosystem, and they have all the interest in promoting it to others

I think this is a good marketing tweet, could encourage artists to onboard with ergo after they realize how easy it is.

The Porcelain Ergo NFT story is important because it shows what a powerful tool Ergo really is. Using the resources developed and contributed by various named and anonymous devs throughout the  ecosystem, one is able to create a project of their own like @ergoporcelain

I just get wants to scam and leave vibes from this guy


[04/11/2023 3:38 AM] deathgripson#2395
like  either that or he actually doesnt understand how easy it is for a founder to market manipulate a token that they own 90% of.


[04/11/2023 3:39 AM] cafebedouin#9837
It's an open forum. What would be the right response, in your opinion?


[04/11/2023 3:39 AM] deathgripson#2395
or maybe doesnt understand how that correlates to theres no such thing as a decentralized hex


[04/11/2023 3:40 AM] deathgripson#2395
you cant just "decentralize" something that is outright a ponzi scheme and make it somehow make money, its still a ponzi scheme and naive users who do not understand this will lock, lose money, and perpetuate the narrative of ponzi culture in ergo


[04/11/2023 3:43 AM] cafebedouin#9837
I created a token called Wooden Nickels. I put $500 in a SigRSV/Wooden Nickels pool. I put all of the tokens in as liquidity. I've locked ot for a year, want to be able to change in the event the SigmaUSD protocol is updated. But entirely possible for me to rug anyone buying the token when the token liquidity frees up. I've talked about Wooden Nickels in main. What is the difference between me and this guy?


[04/11/2023 3:43 AM] deathgripson#2395
The difference would be you are not broadcasting that this wooden nickel is some crazy amazing protocol in general


[04/11/2023 3:44 AM] deathgripson#2395
and if you did we would just understand the context


[04/11/2023 3:44 AM] deathgripson#2395
if you were doing such things i would argue you are a scammer


[04/11/2023 3:47 AM] cafebedouin#9837
The opposite. But, you better believe people questioned my motives initially. When I said it was an "art project" most people that heard about it at all thought it was because I'm a little odd. But, great way for me to learn a lot about minting tokens, how liquidity pools function and so forth. So, I guess my point here is that pursuing some hare brained idea can help people learn. It helps also develop taste. Hard to recognize what is good until you've done some really stupid things first.


[04/11/2023 3:48 AM] cafebedouin#9837
He might also be a scammer, which would also providing a learning opportunity too.


[04/11/2023 3:48 AM] deathgripson#2395
Thats fair I just want it to be clear that I am mad sus at his behavior , you guys dont have to take my word for it. I could be wrong


[04/11/2023 3:50 AM] cafebedouin#9837
From what little I've heard, I'd agree. But, things can also evolve quickly. I mean comet was kind of a joke token and it turned out to have some utility for testing and such. So, never know.


[04/11/2023 3:51 AM] deathgripson#2395
I would rather he just make a joke token tbh, its more tragic when a "promising" protocol gets peoples hopes up and then rugs


[04/11/2023 3:52 AM] deathgripson#2395
well whatever hopefully i am wrong i guess since he seems extremely determined lol


[04/11/2023 3:55 AM] AustenMilbarge#0000
I‚Äôm also in the midst of making Liquidity Pool for GreasyCex. With 3 of us holding appx 40% of supply with the rest meant for tipping, marketing, liquidity pools. With a mission to somehow use it to raise funds toward a CEX listing for Ergo. It‚Äôs a complete joke token, but I‚Äôve tossed around a few ideas about making a way to ‚Äúdonate‚Äù erg and mint GCX. And making it very clear the Erg LP is going to be used to assist in fund a new CEX for ergo. I‚Äôve had most conversation openly in Baseless for everyone to see and all the GCX has been sent through tipper not so everyone knows who got what. Lol.

        He legit proposed it to kushti and kushti told him it was a good idea and he would audit the contract when it was done. Look in dexy chat. I agree that hex is a total fkn scam and don't want that here, but he is proposing a fair game.

[04/11/2023 4:03 AM] AustenMilbarge#0000
I may not hold much weight here yet but this is going to happen on erg eventually anyhow. At least this guy is being straight forward about it.


[04/11/2023 4:10 AM] deathgripson#2395
I think that it comes down to the fact that intentions and implementation do not always align and I just think we ought to be cautious about promoting any behavior that looks directly or indirectly like a ponzi scheme especially when it comes down to establishing it as some sort of "official" protocol. I hope that resonates


[04/11/2023 4:12 AM] deathgripson#2395
I think the only reason I bring it up is because other things seem to guarantee more of a  heads up about assumptions and things of that nature, and this one  frankly does not


[04/11/2023 4:17 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
(re  : *<dŒ£athgripson> I think that it comes down to t...*)
        
        100% agree that this should be this anon guys project and not EF sanctioned haha. That's why I was hoping a known person would take his offer to build it. Just someone we know to have eyes on it


[04/11/2023 4:24 AM] deathgripson#2395
yea that sounds about right im glad we can agree on this


[04/11/2023 4:36 AM] cafebedouin#9837
We also should be clear about the fact that Sigmanauts aren't an endorsement either. Even if kushti says let's give that a go, it could all go sideways. The best way to help people get through bull market craziness is that they need to do their own research, and know everything could go bad. If anyone are does it because kushti, q(x), some random Sigmanaut or some new guy out of the blue said it was a good idea, then better to get burned on a small thing and learn than get screwed over on something that matters.


[04/11/2023 5:43 AM] Luivatra#0000

[04/11/2023 8:31 AM] Gazza_SP#0000
I don't really understand, I just have to invite people to join? To what end exactly?


[04/11/2023 8:41 AM] lexymon#9100
the idea is that we want to onboard as much users as possible, therefore the invitation event. or do you mean why zealy in general?


[04/11/2023 8:45 AM] lexymon#9100
it can be used for different stuff, its can be an aggregator whats going on (similar to ergcube), but users are rewarded by following/retweeting etc.. you can have quests or sprints focusing on content creation, you can boost certain tweets/videos/whatever, maybe some projects on ergo can use it to boost visibility and engagement as well. educational content, quizzes, polls, and so forth


[04/11/2023 8:50 AM] lexymon#9100
just one example: one quest is about creating memes. it can be repeated weekly. i post the meme on ergo memepool twitter account. i even conntected it with ergone, so all ergone earned are redistrbuted to members of the ergo community on zealy at some point. and we have an aggregated place for memes which might gain more traction than memes posted by individuals from time to time


[04/11/2023 9:24 AM] lexymon#9100
what i've done on a regular basis so far is posting links to the content on youtube (amas, dev updates, sigma update and hash it out) and tweets of the day (tho got a bit lazy with this because we only had 3-5 active users), and updated the #ecosystem twitter category with new twitter accounts from dapps on ergo. its also incentivized to visit coingecko and cmc daily and vote ergo up.  maybe with more pagevisits and engagement they will take ergo and ergo projects more seriously ^^;

Twitter


[04/13/2023 3:21 PM] lexymon#9100
hey sigs, i need some input of you. right now, the ergo zealy community doesnt require to put in/connect with any of these: twitter account, discord acc, email acc or ergo wallet address. i left it like this on purpose because i thought forcing users to share their social accounts is not really in the spirit of ergo and no one should be excluded because they dont use any of it. however, i get the feeling that two users are starting to abuse the invite mechanism (as i feared). in theory you can create several metamasks accounts and all you need to do is claim one quest with these new accounts, and your main account gets +1 invite per metamask account you created. by requiring members to connect to their discord or twitter account it gets at least a bit harder to do that (and easier to reveal new accounts with 0 followers). in the end, its about social media engagement anyway, so does the platform need people without social media accounts? probably not. and it makes cheating in the current sprint a bit harder. any thoughts?


[04/13/2023 3:23 PM] qx()#0000
yeah, you have to protect the LP to be fair IMHO

@glasgowm one thing I've noticed on Kaban I don't have access to edit the project description. I don't know if other people are having the same issue but seeing as it's infeasible for you to update all these projects be aware of this. I think its a lot cleaner to have a description at the top for new peole looking to get a quick run down rather than drilling into the comments which usually require an understandfing of what has been happening already

I think he needs to understand his surroundings .. aka ergo community/culture. He hasn‚Äôt seen how everyone works here and truly cares about the integrity of ergo and it‚Äôs community.

And if he is really passionate about it he needs to figure out the way to make it himself. If he were actually trying to build and not just a used car salesman about it, trying to push it with 1500. I think some would have different feeling toward him.

No worries! I really have no business correcting anyone, not that it stops me, perfectly legitimate to tell me to fuck off too. I'm still going to say something if I think you are unnecessarily negative, and I hope you'll do the same for me.


[04/15/2023 11:35 PM] Setvin#2532
I would prefer to be corrected than say be banned and not be able to participate anymore

I think banning people is not in the spirit of decentralization

        It‚Äôs another ergo channel, but like baseless on steroids, not a topic untouched. Lol. Very bold opinions.


[04/15/2023 11:37 PM] Setvin#2532
either as a payout coin or a mining coin


[04/15/2023 11:37 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Right. You have to watch the spirit of the community, but in the main, best to try to include everyone we can, at least I think so.

I don't know what yimp is. I've seen you ask, but I didn't know.


[04/15/2023 11:41 PM] Setvin#2532
its like a pool structure, like mining core


[04/15/2023 11:41 PM] Setvin#2532
its what zergpool is based on


[04/15/2023 11:42 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Do you want that given lithos?


[04/15/2023 11:42 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Lithos is decentralized mining pools. I get the general idea, but K, aka cheese, is the one doing it, I think.

I believe so


[04/15/2023 11:45 PM] Setvin#2532
how compatible is ergo with that structure


[04/15/2023 11:45 PM] Setvin#2532
my incentive to do this is to have ergo added as a payout coin on zergpool


[04/15/2023 11:46 PM] Setvin#2532
so people can mine anything and get paidout in ergo

Good evening Ergoers, it's time to talk tokens! $ERG

What tokens would you like to see listed and what market would you want to trade them against?

Token/USDT ?
Token/ERG ?

or maybe even .. 
Token/SigUSD

Let us know!

Nothing wrong with mining what‚Äôs profitable but yeah he‚Äôs just a crybaby imo

@rustinmyeye  ok the two things i had discussed i was hoping you could tackle:

1. Figure out a strat for pruning sigcans/sigmanauts. This means figuring out and documenting why we would demote and or remove a sigcan or sigmanaut. 
2. Index of who's left and what they do or what their skills are to help with things.

Hey everyone, yield farming testing has gone very well, we have found and fixed a lot of small issues and over the weekend things have ran very smoothly! 

One farm had even finished and almost everyone has unstaked without issue. So we are asking everyone if they can help us make one last push with testing, please stake/unstake with the current farms and all going well we should be ready for the real deal! üî• guide is below üëá

        Ha. They do that at work with training videos. It‚Äôs a clever idea. People can always mute or switch tabs and switch back.


[04/17/2023 12:50 PM] qx()#0000
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs terrible considering they would get free airdrops.

Main plan was that

But it's 14 Mim video üòÇüòÇ


[04/17/2023 12:51 PM] qx()#0000
That‚Äôs for sure fair. Make them watch first 60 secs


[04/17/2023 12:51 PM] qx()#0000
Yah. Def fair


[04/17/2023 12:51 PM] qx()#0000
U could also ask them a question inside video


[04/17/2023 12:52 PM] qx()#0000
Like ‚Äútype the word cw uses to describe xxx somewhere in video‚Äù


[04/17/2023 12:52 PM] qx()#0000
And typing in the correct word reveals the link


[04/17/2023 12:52 PM] qx()#0000
No need for timer using that method


[04/17/2023 12:53 PM] qx()#0000
Forces them to watch or try to scrub through.


[04/17/2023 12:53 PM] qx()#0000
Lots of people would give up tho I imagine lol.

Other option is to re tweet , but also , can't find a way to "authenticate the retweet"


[04/17/2023 12:53 PM] hq3r#0000
Which was the main idea


[04/17/2023 12:54 PM] hq3r#0000
When clicked on tweet, it pops up the iframe and grabs the link and all that but automatically , unhides the hidden content without verifying if the tweet was retweeted or not


[04/17/2023 12:55 PM] hq3r#0000
(re @dadreboi : *Like ‚Äútype the word cw uses to describe xxx so...*)
        
        These can be done on zealy

        On frontend ,you click on External link Button, it takes you to the intermediate page. Where you see the video and wait , and then you get link of zealy or twitter post where the giveaway Is happening

yes, for videos, i just ask for a screenshot as proof (so they at least visited the page and liked it). not ideal tho. thought about asking questions related to the video, but that might be a bit too much. plan to do that in an educational event/sprint at some point tho, but not for the weekly stuff i create tasks for.

Hi Sigs! So im talking with my artist about making an Ergo Foundation NFT collection right now to donate all of the funds there, and im still stuck on something specific where the funds could be put into.


[04/17/2023 7:21 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Any sigs/EF members have any suggestions?


[04/17/2023 7:21 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Would like to have that sorted before I go ahead with it


[04/17/2023 7:21 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
so the community knows where the funds are going.


[04/17/2023 7:22 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I'll have the EF's treasury wallet connected to the Lilium processor for transparency btw


[04/17/2023 7:22 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Or whatever wallet Joe, CW or whoever else says


[04/17/2023 7:23 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
My thinking, is I'd love for it to be used on marketing. I know many people will want it to go to development.


[04/17/2023 7:23 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I think both are a worthy cause


[04/17/2023 7:23 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Would love to hear everyone's thoughts.


[04/17/2023 7:43 PM] Pulsarz#0000
Have you considered the soon to exist Sigmanauts multisig treasury? As far as I understood it from @dadreboi  yesterday it is meant to reward sigmanaut's for small tasks/marketing etc.


[04/17/2023 7:43 PM] Pulsarz#0000
Just mentioning it :)


[04/17/2023 7:44 PM] Pulsarz#0000
I think that's an easier way it would actually be spent on the intended purposes then the direct EF wallet.


[04/17/2023 7:48 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I dont think the community would get behind that honestly.


[04/17/2023 7:48 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I think people would support it going to the EF but not the sigmanauts.


[04/17/2023 7:48 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Just my opinion


[04/17/2023 7:49 PM] Pulsarz#0000
Possible, was just throwing it out there


[04/17/2023 7:49 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I like the idea. Might even be the better way forward.


[04/17/2023 7:49 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I just think the community would be like uhhh what


[04/17/2023 7:52 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I could make a poll on twitter


[04/17/2023 7:52 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
see what the community wants.


[04/17/2023 7:52 PM] Pulsarz#0000
Tbh I'm not sure, maybe it shoulf be a separate multisig wallet some EF people and some Sig's have access to


[04/17/2023 7:53 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Does Lilium support multi-sig?


[04/17/2023 7:53 PM] Pulsarz#0000
I think making the EF spend it themselves might be hard tbh


[04/17/2023 7:53 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
We've done it before tbh with my project and Blitz TCG


[04/17/2023 7:53 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
did a collab and sent funds to the EF.


[04/17/2023 7:54 PM] hq3r#0000

Different form means not spending money.

Turning into something like the sigmanauts, or sigmanauts turning into the EF. However, you want to think about it...

If I can make a suggestion , this frame of the picture is not very grammatical. I think you could just get rid of the "they has one of the top developer ranks," line entirely as well as the "by the community" part as it is implied. This would make it sound more natural in English. At the end it should say "Support local open source developers and technology that will make a difference"

Not sure who to specifically tell this to, idk who produced this

        ErgoMonitor reports it the moment the tx hits the mempool, but SigmaFI UI only shows the orders with at least 1 confirmation, so it takes a few minutes before it shows up in the UI and you can take the offer

Maybe we should make a bot that auto-tips people some native token based on upvotes


[04/18/2023 1:53 PM] wombo22#5461
not completely against that, I read a post the other day saying ever since r/cc introduced moons it did increase the number of posts just not the quality

[04/18/2023 1:59 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah might be too much, but would be good to highlight all our native tokens whereas other subreddits just tip 1 shitcoin. Maybe make it proportional to their activity on the subreddit in general to stop spammers. Will have a swatch at the Reddit API

if you bring an inactive list to sig meeting or chat


[04/18/2023 8:06 PM] qx()#0000
we can parse through it and call out "oh yeah, he's on twitter, she's on reddit...etc..."

or "he spends time developing and adding to the ecosystem", which, i think is still warranted if they want to be here.


[04/18/2023 8:08 PM] qx()#0000
take cheese for example, or kras...would be a shame not to have them here just because they don't participate in the collective...they are building the ecosystem and having them involved as a sig to reach out when needed is a benefit imho.


[04/18/2023 8:08 PM] hq3r#0000
One think o have acknowledged today on socials, we dont have much educated ergo people o we have to hesitate people to talk about ergo tecnical stuff, so simple noobie Tec articles Will help with that

its a good starting point the discord list


[04/18/2023 8:09 PM] rustinmyeye#3722
i just dont get why someone would want to be part of a group, but stick to their own project silently, and not chat a bit to keep up. seems like there are only 8 - 10 voting sigs as well.


[04/18/2023 8:09 PM] Pulsarz#0000
i am still active on discord but 80% telegram these days

@glasgowm your docs bot can be added to a ergoAi channel? To help search stuff at one place


[04/18/2023 8:09 PM] Pulsarz#0000
but no discord activity in 3 months is probably a good tracker


[04/18/2023 8:09 PM] rustinmyeye#3722
but sig stuff is only here

then might lead us to figure out how to keep some people that are active in other ways perhaps...or not


[04/18/2023 8:30 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Not much for chatting. But, I'm a good litmus test. Am I a Sig? I'm not a developer. I'm not doing Sig meetings for the most part. I did do a little work on SigmaFi docs today, which really points at what I like to do, help other people with their projects and do support.

[04/19/2023 6:06 PM] cafebedouin#9837
@Setvin, I took a look at yiimp. A couple of things that stand out to me:
1. The repo hasn't been updated in 27 months.
2. They have a stratum section for multiple algos. These look like they are written for C. At minimum, you would need something for this that you cribbed from somewhere else or wrote yourself.
3. This is a bit beyond my technical depth. You might try talking to Cheese or WilfordGrimley. My sense is that both of the community pools, i.e., GetBlok and Enigmapool, either shut down or stopped mining Ergo because the economics of running a pool don't work for small pools given current price of Ergo, economies of scale, etc.

That's as much as I can offer on the topic of yiimp. Hope it helps.

I‚Äôm helping to work through pruning sigmanauts and sig cans‚Ä¶.

Who wants out? Reply or DM me. Anywhere.

Who wants to be Sigmanaut? IReplay or DM me. Anywhere.

@chucked1993 @AustenMilbarge @Pulsarzz ? Who else‚Ä¶ need to tag more on discord and other places. I want ergkleure in as well.

@essaias how are you doing? Do you want me to put you up for a vote for Sigmanaut status? I see you‚Äôve been here since about October last year, you‚Äôre a conversation starter, and you have mod experience. Let me know if being a Sigmanaut is still of interest to you.


[04/20/2023 11:42 PM] rustinmyeye#0000
Hey Sigmanauts I‚Äôve put up a ton of votes today! :)

You don‚Äôt have to wait for ‚Äúvote weekend‚Äù to start voting! It works anytime ;)

I made one vote to test the system. I‚Äôd like to see how many people see this stuff. It‚Äôs easy and requires no opinion.

I made one vote to remove Jos√© from the Sigmanauts since he ditched us.

And‚Ä¶

6 new votes to move sig-cans to Sigmanaut. Pulsarz, Lexymon, Chuck, Joshua, Mikey, and Kleure.

I‚Äôm still creeping other candidates, so will have more votes shortly probably. Let‚Äôs let people in or kick people out!  lol

Hehe, I'm alive, running my nodes, the site and yeah sometimes I tweet about Ergo - but also other projects I support. 

Honestly I still don't fully understand what the exact definition of a Sigmanaut is in a nutshell.  So maybe yes, maybe no? ü§î


[04/21/2023 6:59 AM] NoahErgo#4349
@hq3r @Pulsarz do you guys know if there is an api for sigmafi tvl


[04/21/2023 7:00 AM] NoahErgo#4349
trying to hack together a defillama adaptor but i am nanderthal dont know wtf im doing

how would this work


[04/21/2023 7:00 AM] Pulsarz#0000
I could provide the api but not the connector itself


[04/21/2023 7:01 AM] Pulsarz#0000
err lemme check if I can do it today

what would we want to get? all the info that's in the ongoing loans + open orders basically?


[04/21/2023 7:03 AM] Pulsarz#0000
total sum? so collateral + interest?


[04/21/2023 7:03 AM] NoahErgo#0000
yeah i think thats how tvl on ui is calculated one sec


[04/21/2023 7:03 AM] hq3r#0000
Defillama normally what offers is


[04/21/2023 7:03 AM] Pulsarz#0000
ah yes forgot about that


[04/21/2023 7:03 AM] hq3r#0000
Total tvl


[04/21/2023 7:03 AM] hq3r#0000
It's already done on frontend


[04/21/2023 7:04 AM] Pulsarz#0000
okay ill be quick to finish moving stuff to new library and I'll start, I have all building blocks (node interface, sigmafi box parsers)


[04/21/2023 7:04 AM] Pulsarz#0000
what parameters will be fed into the api? wasn't it blockheight and timestamp or something?

with an api at least


[04/21/2023 7:06 AM] NoahErgo#0000
i guess there are sdk adaptors that dont use apis that ask for timestamp and blockheight


[04/21/2023 7:07 AM] NoahErgo#0000
‚ÄúFetch adapters only allow us to get the TVL at the current time, so it's impossible to fill old values on a protocol's TVL chart or recompute them, thus leading to charts that look jumpy. To solve this we introduced SDK adapters, which allow us to retrieve a protocol's TVL at any point in time."

but anyways, the defillama adaptor is something they run, so just need to make a PR with an adaptor that calls the api providing the tvl, so if that api exists the hard part is done

[04/21/2023 8:17 AM] Pulsarz#0000
so basically you just need simple GetTVL endpoint? I looked at the sdk connector last night, maybe thats why I was confused


[04/21/2023 8:18 AM] Pulsarz#0000
finished moving all my sigmatype/node stuff to FleetSharp lib so will start now


[04/21/2023 12:15 PM] qx()#0000
Defi llama likes everything to be done in the connector. I wrote an api endpoint and the connector a while back and they rewrote my connector to bypass my api endpoint. He wants his connectors to read the chain directly.


[04/21/2023 12:44 PM] Luivatra#0000
interesting, maybe they changed that


[04/21/2023 12:46 PM] qx()#0000
Perhaps people were modifying their endpoints or just had mistakes and it was reporting incorrectly. Seems like a stand up guy tbh.


[04/21/2023 12:46 PM] qx()#0000
Not as standup as you of course Lui.


[04/21/2023 12:46 PM] qx()#0000
But close ;)


[04/21/2023 12:49 PM] Luivatra#0000

[04/21/2023 12:51 PM] rustinmyeye#3722
Nice, Good to hear from you! I‚Äôm struggling with understanding what it means to be a Sigmanaut as well‚Ä¶ no definition as of now it seems, but a pretty general set a of values that should be followed. There is a dedicated chat to come up with a definition, but no activity there since December 9. Maybe I‚Äôll go there to make people talk again‚Ä¶ anyway if you feel better remaining a sig can until a definition is made that‚Äôs cool, but if you think you could help with that or just want in, I can put you up for a vote.

[04/21/2023 1:09 PM] rustinmyeye#3722
To be honest I don‚Äôt like organized groups with definitions and rules and things. I joined here out of curiosity, but now I can‚Äôt leave until I figure it out‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs an illness maybe haha. I just don‚Äôt get what the point of a group, with voting, and membership status, and all this stuff is, without a definition or requirements of its members. If it was purely social and collaboration space I get it, but it‚Äôs not that.


[04/21/2023 1:11 PM] rustinmyeye#3722

[04/21/2023 1:15 PM] essaias#5787
Well if being a "Sigmanaut" has no responsibilities or tasks assigned to it everybody problably could be one. But as there is a program to become one there obviously should be some facts what a Sigmanaut is.
Honestly ppl can call me whatever they want - but if I am asked to choose to be part of something I (personally) love to know what I sign up to üòâ

understand that way: imagine job filing. If you - as a company - are looking for a senior java dev you usually put some skills, tasks, responsibilites and rewards in that job offer / description.


[04/21/2023 1:30 PM] rustinmyeye#3722
So the way I‚Äôm defining the Sigmanauts in my own head right now (not official, fantasy, probably wrong) - a group of ego enthusiasts, helping each other, brainstorming, collaborating, assigning their own tasks and goals, helping find goals for others who are stuck, volunteer work, voting rights on cool things that can effect the ecosystem, should be reachable in some way

[04/21/2023 1:46 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I'm not much of a joiner either. I think the purpose of these groups is to help create informal connections between people of similar interests, or just opening up possibilities that weren't really there before. For example, curbside created sigmabot and asked for contributions. But, it was something he just did and I decided to learn gif and do a bit of work on it. Now, imagine he asked in this group, what are the chances he'd get more help? Rinse, repeat. Noah's doing the same with SignaFi docs. Took the initiative. Much easier to ask for contributions here than in general, because it's a more committed group. The voting is just a informal screening process, because someone like alohaki might bring bad vibes (or not), the uncertainty is the problem with him.

if you see a metric being shared just think

does DefiLlama track this metric?

if not, its probably because the data is incredibly unreliable and easily gamed

coingecko is used for erg price, spectrum is used for token prices

(re @Pulsarzz : *coingecko is used for erg price, spectrum is u...*)
        
        As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to modify or add APIs to existing codebases. However, I can provide some guidance on how you might go about adding this API to the DeFiLlama Connector Code.

To add this API to the DeFiLlama Connector Code, you would need to modify the code to make a request to the SigmaExplorer API endpoint and parse the response to extract the Total Value Locked (TVL) data. The exact implementation details would depend on the programming language and libraries used in the Connector Code.

Here are the general steps you would need to follow:

Add the SigmaExplorer API endpoint to the list of endpoints in the Connector Code.
Make an HTTP request to the API endpoint using a library like requests (Python) or axios (JavaScript).
Parse the response data to extract the TVL value for the SigmaFi protocol.
Add the TVL data to the DeFiLlama database or UI.
Keep in mind that you may need to update other parts of the codebase to properly display and handle the new TVL data.

It's also worth noting that the DeFiLlama team is responsible for maintaining and updating the Connector Code, so you may want to reach out to them to discuss adding this API or any other changes to the codebase.

[04/21/2023 3:01 PM] hq3r#0000
(re @Pulsarzz : *haven't written a parser yet for ongoing loans*)
        
        import requests

# Define the API endpoints for each DeFi protocol
Sigmafi_ENDPOINT = 'https://api.sigmaexplorer.org/sigmafi/tvl'

# Define a function to get the TVL for a given endpoint
def get_tvl(endpoint):
    response = requests.get(endpoint)
    data = response.json()
    return data['tvl']

# Get the TVL for Sigmafi
Sigmafi_tvl = get_tvl(Sigmfi_ENDPOINT)

# Print the TVL for Sigmafi protocol
print(f"Sigmafi TVL: ${Sigmafi_tvl}")

        not returning tokens


[04/23/2023 5:06 PM] qx()#0000
too much work


[04/23/2023 5:07 PM] qx()#0000
here:

Proposed Voting Augmentation
- New sigs mint their own token
- Sigs register token ID with their userid on the sigmavote edit user page (the page you add tele/discord id)
- When people create a new vote/proposal on sigmavote site, it creates two wallets that are tied to Yes or No and shows a QR code for them as well
- Sigmanauts send one of their vote tokens to the yes or no wallet.

Backend:
- System looks for all registered token id‚Äôs in the wallets and ONLY records one instance of it of the users one vote.
- After a certain block height the system will stop counting them.
- Will save seed of wallets just in case someone Leroy‚Äôs some erg into them.

because:
- minting tokens with each vote and returning them is a lot more moving parts I don't want to do at the moment. 
- as a new sig, minting and registering your own personal vote token shows at least some initiative.

each vote will have its own unique two wallets


[04/23/2023 5:10 PM] hq3r#0000
Why not limit them by block and use this API? And your just need to input X amount of blocks from last block height set


[04/23/2023 5:10 PM] qx()#0000

(re @dadreboi : *here:

- New sigs...*)
        
        Do we need to worry about storage rent on the used addresses? 

Should token be burned automatically when vote is up, or sigs need to register new vote tokens periodically maybe.

So that vote tokens don‚Äôt go into the wild and get reused by someone else. 

Not sure if that‚Äôs even something to worry about. Quite ignorant here.

On ‚Äúcreate vote‚Äù it says closed after 7 days. So I was going off of that


[04/23/2023 10:15 PM] rustinmyeye#0000
So if I make a vote now it closes on the 30th? And if I make it on may 1 it closes may 31?


[04/23/2023 10:17 PM] rustinmyeye#0000

[04/24/2023 12:05 AM] drehaf#0090
all the script will do is replace one file that can submit with another file that says "submissions on hold during study week/vote weekend"


[04/24/2023 12:05 AM] drehaf#0090
really, i needs shoring up before i dive into voting wallets


[04/24/2023 12:05 AM] rustinmyeye#0000
Ok.


[04/24/2023 12:05 AM] drehaf#0090
and yes, we need either storage rent on the wallets (so give them each a tiny bit of erg), or, we just have all sigs make a new token every four years (much easier and cheaper).


[04/24/2023 12:06 AM] rustinmyeye#0000

[04/24/2023 12:06 AM] rustinmyeye#0000

[04/24/2023 12:07 AM] drehaf#0090
can also have a script that sends an NFT to a main sigmanauts wallet of each vote outcome. or it can be sent from a multisig wallet so that we know there was some consensus of the results.


[04/24/2023 12:08 AM] drehaf#0090
i mean, either way, history is in the chain still so it doesn't really matter if the boxes get eaten


[04/24/2023 12:18 AM] rustinmyeye#0000
Yeah, more concerned about tokens being reused somehow, but I may not understand how storage rent works. If there is no erg, do the tokens get burned, stay, or claimed by the miner? I assumed the miners claimed it. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong.


[04/24/2023 12:24 AM] drehaf#0090
correct

so if we just recreate and they reregister, every 4 years should be ok

Come be a pure text true believer. Next thing you'll be telling how emacs org mode is the one true, GTD.


[04/24/2023 1:19 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Miners aren't going to care about our custom vote tokens. I kind of like the idea of registering the Wooden Nickels tokenid, and the first person that buys and sends the token to the relevant address gets to vote on my behalf, the wildcard vote.


[04/24/2023 1:19 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Chances of that happening, close to nil.

i'm falling behind. great to see so much activity in here and the Ergo general chats are filling up again. hard to keep up

how was the meeting? where do we post those and i'll catch up

anyone want to help me keep the announcements channel updated on Discord? i'm sure i'm missing stuff from the ecosystem that's important

i always hit the announcements channel when i look into a project so nice to keep it as updated as possible

Sigmanat/Ergonauts Meeting 4/23/23

- Support the community and core projects. That means watching for events announced and try your best to attend them, or, testing protocols, or, joining betas. Example: Put up a small test loan on sigmafi so you know how it works. Join the sprint with ergo/zealy! Point is, we need to support eachother as we continue to build in this market!
- Each of us should do our best to know the ecosystem and its public facing tools. 
- Went over voting procedure and how it works (live demo)
- Rustinmyeye is working on pruning standards for Sigcans and Sigmanauts. He has a list with activity which was posted in chat and if people can help look it over and fill in some holes about others activities and or contacts. Voting system will be reworked into a on chain voting system with two wallets for each vote. Sigmanauts will mint their own token and register it with the sigmavote site. Voting via telegram and discord will need to be reevaluated and possibly have some sort of wallet attached like tipperbot. Will cross that bridge later as on chain voting is more important for transparency. 
- Glasgow has sent out the remainder of invites to taiga.io, please join and take a dive in. 
- Angie is publishing a bunch of new articles, including the sigmanauts article!
- Angie reminds us to keep an eye out for the poker event coming up.
- Mikey spoke about reaching out to Dan to provide higher quality merch to Dan at the next cardano event where Dan will be for zengate. 
- qx() has an interested party as well as other members from last time so feels confident to get started on multisig for treasury.
- Glasgow did some more tweaking on the models for chatgpt ergo info integration. 
- MHS_Sam has done a great Q&A output in the Rosen telegram, qx() will attempt to make some sort of gra <clipped message>

Thanks for doing the recap. It helps me a lot to keep up with what happens here. üôÇ


[04/24/2023 12:04 PM] essaias#5787
Did I get the above disussion right: you are (planning)/doing sigmanaut approval voting on chain?


[04/24/2023 12:04 PM] essaias#5787
Or is that some other vote, you were talking about?


[04/24/2023 12:06 PM] hq3r#0000
(re  : *<essaias> Did I get the above disussion right:...*)
        
        Yup,on chain voting when ever a vote is up, it creates 2 address where all sigmanauts can voted with there registered tokens


[04/24/2023 12:18 PM] essaias#5787
awesome. first I thought "overkill" but if that is possible without a lot overhead this is one more proof of ergos technology... in fact it might be worth an article.

We need numbers ....


[04/24/2023 9:46 PM] wombo22#5461
other option have just a community meeting where anyone can join a talk separate from sigs meeting.


[04/24/2023 9:47 PM] wombo22#5461
could also consider the weekly update in the marketing channel that but just without the zoom meeting

[04/24/2023 9:50 PM] wombo22#5461
yep numbers help, its just when you said invite that question arises "why cant I join" people who dont get invited and guess it turns into a question or is it an open invitation or you need someone to actually invite you

(re @dadreboi : *here:

Proposed Voting Augmentation
- New sigs...*)
        
        Maybe possible to modify tipperbot to be used as a vote wallet, for interacting with the vote via disco or tele or twitter or reddit.

Something like - 

!listvotes - for a list of active votes, numbered, and with title and link to description

!vote 69 yes - example of a yes vote for active vote number 69. Obviously the vote number will be changed the by user for whatever vote they want, and there would be the normal options ‚Äúyes‚Äù ‚Äúno‚Äù ‚Äúabstain‚Äù ‚Äúdelete‚Äù.

Additional text could maybe even be an input for the ‚Äúreason‚Äù field. Like how tipper bot allows additional text.

You‚Äôd do - !restore to add your vote existing vote wallet, or !new to make a new one.

It‚Äôd send one of the users vote tokens per vote‚Ä¶ no quantity option. We‚Äôd have to figure a way to tell it what token to use for all votes for that user. Maybe it wouldn‚Äôt need to know? Could it just read the contents and send whatever token is in there? (obvi only users vote tokens should be in there‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôll send tokens only‚Ä¶ erg only for tx fees.

Thinking out loud here


[04/25/2023 12:35 AM] qx()#0000
Yah. Could use Lui‚Äôs tool if he is willing. But I also already worked the framework out in my head on how it will work, so, not impossible for me to implement voting bot with wallet on tele and discord. Lui might not want to jack up his code as I really hope at some point he starts taking like .XX of each tx for his server costs and Twitter api


[04/25/2023 12:36 AM] qx()#0000
Essentially the sigma vote would also make u a wallet when u registered a token.


[04/25/2023 12:36 AM] qx()#0000
U then just send it some of ur own vote tokens.


[04/25/2023 12:37 AM] qx()#0000
Then when u do /ep voting 68 yes
It will send one token to the yes wallet


[04/25/2023 12:37 AM] qx()#0000
So commands on tele and discord don‚Äôt change at all.


[04/25/2023 12:38 AM] rustinmyeye#0000
Sweet! Don‚Äôt realize you were already thinking on the discord and tele implementations


[04/25/2023 12:38 AM] rustinmyeye#0000

U guys can already delete votes u know?


[04/25/2023 12:39 AM] rustinmyeye#0000
Not saying adding this to tipperbot‚Ä¶ meant a fork


[04/25/2023 12:39 AM] qx()#0000
If there is a vote there u don‚Äôt want if more than ten sigs hit delete it will remove it.

That number should change as more and more sigs join. I should make it a percentage.

@drehaf, I'm getting ambitious. Going to see if I can do a site that has landing page, application, vision statement, meeting notes from 2023, etc. Messing around with Hugo to build it, but I might change it because the theme I've chosen isn't playing nice. I was thinking a static markdown based site hosted on github would open it up to anyone to do contributions and would enable finished Google and other docs, such as the vision statement and meeting notes to have a more permanent home somewhere. Bit more work to set-up, but it will probably pay dividends later. If anyone has preference for a particular technology: vue, jekyll, docbook, or whatever. I'm open to changing, at this point in the process. Will push changes to this repo once I have something functional: https://github.com/cafebedouin/sigmanauts

Preview will be: https://cafebedouin.github.io/sigmanauts/

[04/26/2023 1:25 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Graphics cards are a PITA on Linux. Arch? Great way to get exactly the system you want, and learn about all the decisions other distros make. Definitely a steep learning curve. Used it for a bit, mucking around with a C201 laptop: https://cafebedouin.org/2018/05/16/freedom-limits-the-asus-c201-with-libreboot-and-parabola-linux/

I like open BSD, alpine, arch, fedora, Debian, Android, macOS, and iOS. These are the only operating systems I‚Äôve really used and like, sort of ordered as well. iOS is my least fave but the best for me day to day because it always works, no matter what, every-time.

If you are that deep into OSes should maybe also look at flavors of Android, such as LineageOS, GrapgeneOS, and if you like messing with hardware, something like pine phone. I had to support macs in a computer lab in grad school. Never could use them after. Everything works, if you are in the ecosystem. If not, nothing works as expected. Drives me crazy.

Currently, having the same trouble with Hugo websites. Builds great static websites for desktop and mobile, but the abstraction makes it more difficult to know what's going on under the hood so it can be tweaked to do what I want. I also think I'm doing something stupid, but I'm not sure what the stupid thing is.... at least I have passed the Dunner Kruger threshold and realize I am part of the problem.

Well #ergonauts gets invited currently and they are not all sigs. Was considering adding the Contributors role into #ergonauts too (You gain this one when you're active in the weekly dev chat) and having it act as an 'ergo association'.  Between EF<>Builders<>'Core'<>Sigs

So, framework is done. If you think this is dark, we can change the theme pretty easily, I think. Not sure how to put the application functionality, there has to be some kind of escape function to drop you into HTML to do it, but not sure how to do it.

I haven't done any of the writing, but I did cut/paste the meeting notes. Once I get a little feedback here, I'll start adding text. Anyone want to do a PR, please feel free. Adding content is just adding file.md under the content directory. Also, it is possible to have this post to a custom domain, which I understand we already have. http://cafebedouin.github.io/sigmanauts

        Can you answer this follow up or probably @mhs_sam as I dont know the answer here

"How do they solve for Sybil attacks for their guards?

Even if they have a solution for that, at the end of the day, this is basically just trusting a select group of people to manually perform actions. I don't even see the need for "watchers" in their setup honestly, since they rely on the guards to verify the data they broadcast. And because watchers can be anyone there is no sybil protection and one guard could be n number of watchers.

To me this seems like something that has the dressings of using blockchain technology, but doesn't actually solve anything using it.

Edit: It also looks like it'd be super easy to create opportunities to collude to steal funds i.e. just make a bunch of new watchers and a setup a contract that splits whatever it receives to some or all of the guards and then just keep broadcasting fake txs from other chains that say "someone has just deposited everything we have on ergo and want us to send it to this contract that just happens to pays out to all of us!" If the guards agree to it they can redistribute money to themselves"

        Guards actually go out and verify the tx too, they don‚Äôt take the watchers word for it. So, you‚Äôd have to poison the watchers as well as the guards‚Ä¶the watcher can report one event per permit token and until the guard verifies, the permit token the watcher won‚Äôt get it back and could lose it for malfeasance. The guards even have the ability to regroup and change the multisig wallet in case of a bad actor or inactive client. In that case, the bad actor guard will lose their stake in the contract.

I got this, per the sigmabonds GitHub readme, after the maturity height has been reached the lender may choose to execute a liquidation transaction thus causing whatever collateral was provided to be sent to the wallet that issued the loan, of course this makes sense but was just making sure and about the mechanics, 

The liquidation does not occur automatically so make sure to liquidate if that is your intention

        same code, however code is open and guards can change it. Also, there is the possibility of using different backends. e.g. I like to use Koios, another guards wants to use Ogmios. 
guards will receive RSN for normal behavior. also, each guard has some RSN tokens locked and in case of malicious behavior, he will lose them all at once.

(re @Gazza_SP : *Can you answer this follow up or probably @mhs...*)
        
        There is a lot of nested questions here üòÄ
- no need for watchers: yep, it would be possible to get rid of a separate role and integrate the watcher's task into guard's code. However, there are some benefits to having a separate role. For example, this will help to protect guards from Dos attacks through dust deposits. It also will help to scale the bridge without increasing the computational cost of the guard set. It also adds a verification layer since the watcher's code is somehow different from the guards' to verify the transactions. Moreover, it might help preventing some unknown and unforeseen attacks since the guards are passive and will wait for a validated report and will not start actions as soon as a deposit happens. It is more or less like the SWIFT network in international banking.
I'm working on a detailed comparison with Wormhole but for short, in wormhole the guardians see an event and agree on it, then create a VAA (a signed message with metadata about the event), this VAA will be fed to a smart contract at the destination chain that triggers the payment. Rosen is working at the other end, reports are being made by the messaging system but they are not final and actionable like VAAs, they are just established gossips, the guards then verify and act accordingly. We think that this approach is more robust to smart contract attacks and possible vulnerabilities. 

- sybil attacks for watchers: watcher network is open however reporting is not free. A watcher has to obtain some reporting permit by locking some RSN and one reporting permit is needed for each report. When a transfer is successfully done, the permit token + reporting reward will be sent to the watcher. On the other hand, if a report is not correct or will not result in a successful transfer for any reason, the token will be collec <clipped message>

        -"To me this seems like something that has the dressings of using blockchain technology, but doesn't actually solve anything using it." making a bridge is very simple, have one single entity to lock on one side and unlock on the other, however you should trust this guy. We're doing the same here and using the blockchain we're adding incentives for collaborative good behavior to mimic that single guy.

        The sigmafi channel is just posts about new loan requests and bonds


[04/28/2023 6:03 AM] Pulsarz#0000
But you can send a DM to the bot to register addresseq manually and then you will get personal notifications whenever a transaction happens from/to that address (has nothing to do with sigmafi)

Ok so if anyone wants to get into a little back and forth. I totally want to be convinced otherwise. I'm just wondering if these collateralized loans makes sense for the borrower. Of course as a lender you want to make money and need collateral. But as far as crypto collateral, no one is going to loan to you if you don't match the sigusd amount request with the same amount or equivalent in erg (ostensibly more value). If you have that collateral you have what you are requesting. For example, I want 5 sigusd, so I put up 5 erg, why not just keep the 5 erg, and use it? What am I missing here. The reason home equity loans and stuff work is because you aren't going to really leave your house. And it's not so liquid.


[04/28/2023 3:33 PM] qx()#0000
(re  : *<fredballs> Ok so if anyone wants to get into ...*)
        
        if i think erg will go to $10 by end of year, i will borrow a shit load of SigUSD and then buy a shit load of erg at current prices. I can also set an APY at a crazy amount (like 100% even) because I would think that erg will 10X...when it comes time to pay out the loan, i sell a small amount of that erg i purchased with the borrowed sigUSD and pay back that loan....i now have ALL that extra erg and my collateral back again.


[04/28/2023 3:34 PM] qx()#0000
that's leveraging.....


[04/28/2023 3:36 PM] qx()#0000
the other way is an IRL loan....lets say i need to buy a used car and my credit is shit....i can ask for sigusd loan for a reasonable APY and cash out then save monthly until the due date to pay it back....

You can even mix these...need a loan for a car and are SURE erg will go up? Get out more sigusd than you need, cash out some of it for the car, buy erg with the rest, hopefully erg goes up and that extra erg pays your interest and some of your principal.


[04/28/2023 3:52 PM] AustenMilbarge#0000
(re  : *<fredballs> Ok so if anyone wants to get into ...*)
        
        In real world use case is typically people get loans because they don‚Äôt have all the money to make the purchase they want. It‚Äôs be cool to somehow figure out a down payment system. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôd possible because unlike a car loan or home, you couldn‚Äôt come take the house if they didn‚Äôt pay up. 

But down payment system on big loans may be interesting, if you got the APY amount or some % as an immediate down payment would maybe push people to be taking those bigger 5k-10k loans.


[04/28/2023 4:05 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I'll tell you a personal example. I bought SPF during the sale, tokenjay p2p transfer for $0.06. When listed, SPF went for $0.12. It's pretty obvious that SPF will drop from listing price over the short term, until they have it integrated into payments and likely until their L2 is launched. I borrow as much SPF as I could, which was in increments of 1000, and offer 1% interest per month on each loan. I use SigUSD is my collateral because I happened to have a bunch of it at the time. Price drops to $0.06. I pay  1060 SPF out of the Ergopad stake key allocation. Person offered the loan got a 6% return on their SPF in less than 2 months. That's win/win for everyone.


[04/28/2023 4:10 PM] cafebedouin#9837
A more normal example would be, assume price is going up, ask 1000 SigUSD for 6 months with 10% interest and collateralized with 1000 Erg. When loan is fulfilled, you convert SigUSD -> to Erg with the hope that price goes up in 6 months and you can convert your Erg back to SigUSD and pay less back relative to the Erg you have. But, the lender has the guarantee of a 10% return in 6 months AND if price goes down below collateral, the possibility of getting Erg at that price. Also possible that the borrower forgets to pay back on time. But, base case is they pay back and you get a guaranteed 10% return in 6 month, hedge your portfolio, and have the potential of large upside.


[04/28/2023 4:13 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Ergo will eventually have a bounty system, same used when you hire contractors, say 1/3 on deal, 1/3 on beginning of work, 1/3 on completion. Also, subscriptions over some time frame are the same idea. I'd expect someone to develop some general tool like SigmaFi for this use case.


[04/28/2023 5:07 PM] fredballs#7488
Ok so basically it's a tool for investors already in the crypto space. No one who doesn't already have an interest in crypto is going to buy a stake just to get for instance the amount for a car because they could just buy the car with the stake, unless like mentioned they want to take more and invest excess. It's an investing tool period. When real world assets are tokenized this would work much better. But if cbdcs take over and the government gets into controlling the off ramps, and specifying who can lend, they could restrict who can lend. I like the intent here and I'll have to decide how I'd like to use the tool, betting on degens defaulting or on conviction of a specific outcome for a specific asset.


[04/28/2023 5:36 PM] cafebedouin#9837
As with any financial instrument, the limits are a function of the assets involves. You cannot underwrite mortgages, car loans, etc. without having property infrastructure of deeds, titles, etc. and the rule of law to back them up. Some "law" can be abstracted out in the form of smart contracts, rather than traditional avenues like a closing for transfer of title, which will make for some efficiencies. But, there are limits, despite what some crypto enthusiasts might wish.

many thanks for looking into this!
I've put done a few things already, guess the idea is to just dump as much as you can in segments...then we can combine segments and or split them and figure out allocations, needs based on rank of importance, etc....

part of that service fee goes to the person who coded the back end contracts and logic, the rest of it goes to the person who coded the front end.

Okay, recap time: user count grew from ~50 to 258. around 100 of that definitely bots, maybe more. fortunately i could filter out the users who invited fake accounts manually. this would not have been possible if the sprint took off more than it did, so i'm kind of happy it didnt. was it a success? i dont think so. i must admit i was a bit naive about the botting issue, probably because im not really experienced in that kind of stuff. i also think many ergonauts might be reluctant to join the platform due to its centralized nature and privacy issues coming with that + no official support, just a random guy organizing + promoting it on its private twitter/reddit account. i still think however that its a good way to promote and educate about ergo, therefore future sprints will focus on not-bottable content-creation and educational tasks. one ergonaut even considers to hold nft giveaways on our ergo community because its easy to create tasks that are a bit more elaborate than "follow and retweet and leave your wallet address in the comments below"! üòÑ  i'd appreciate the sigs feedback and thoughts on that. üôÇ


[05/01/2023 7:40 AM] lexymon#9100
currently, the tweet of the day quests (like+retweet) are claimed ~10-15 times every day. about the same number of users upvote ergo on cmc/coingecko daily, post comments on cmc weekly and like youtube content.

And maybe some informativo article and stuff


[05/01/2023 11:01 AM] cafebedouin#9837
We probably don't have enough writers to make building a system worthwhile. It also depends on what they need. Is it something like Noah's Docbook with SigmaFi? Is it someone to do proofing of their existing documentation? Is it something else? @Gazza_SP, what do you think is needed?


[05/01/2023 11:18 AM] Gazza_SP#0000
I'll be honest I wasn't at the meeting so I'm completely out of the loop here, what kind of rewarding system?
