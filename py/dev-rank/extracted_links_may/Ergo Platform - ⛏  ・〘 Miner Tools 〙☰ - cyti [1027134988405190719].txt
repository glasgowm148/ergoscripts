CYTI stands for Choose Your Token ID, this is a "minable" smart contrat allowing to mint tokens with a given character sequence at the begining of the token ID.
A token minter create a CITY request, miners tries to generates the proper token ID using the CITY miner software.
When one of the miners succeed, it get the fee from the CYTI contract and the token with the right token ID is sent to the token minter.
Depending on the length of the character sequence requested, the computation is more or less difficult, the miners will be able to set a minimal price for the request for the possible requested length.
For example the following transaction has minted "cccccc" tokens from a CYTI request:

So amazing


[10/09/2022 5:08 PM] H7#4402
@haileypdll this maybe a stupid question but I can mine/validate other contracts not just anything my address creates right?

Essentially all I need to do is run the miner with a change in address which the fee will go and wait for someone to mint?


[10/09/2022 6:02 PM] haileypdll#3353
Currently you cannot filter and mine only the contract your address has created. (no selfish mining)
The miner will pick random contracts that meet the minimal fee requirement. 
In the configuration you can set a minimal fee depending on the length of the requirement for the first characters of the token id.
This option could be implemented... Or maybe remove the minimal fee check if the address of the miner match the address that created the request.

Yes, you can just let the miner runs in the background, it consumes very few resources if there is nothing to be mined.
With default configuration it will check every 20s if there is a new request to be mined.

I will lower the recommended fee as I made a mistake in my computation.


[10/09/2022 6:03 PM] H7#4402
Thanks for that, what is the recommended fee?


[10/09/2022 6:08 PM] haileypdll#3353
In the config.js file, in the same directory than the miner:

[10/09/2022 6:11 PM] H7#4402
ah, thank you


[10/09/2022 6:12 PM] H7#4402
Also, "Number of worker processes" is this threads?


[10/09/2022 6:15 PM] haileypdll#3353
technically, they are processes because it gave better performance, but yes they could be named threads. This is how much the miner will run in parallel and consume resources.


[10/09/2022 6:16 PM] H7#4402
Got it, but still same concept as cpu thread arguments right? So if I have 35 threads


[10/09/2022 6:16 PM] H7#4402
I can run up to 35 processes?


[10/09/2022 6:18 PM] haileypdll#3353
On my system, with 12c/24t, the best performance was for 20, but it make the computer laggy. 16 is a good value. 8 allow to use the computer without noticing.


[10/09/2022 6:19 PM] H7#4402
Thank you, just launched across a bunch of different systems


[10/09/2022 6:19 PM] H7#4402
Will report any bugs, issues etc. Will circle back once I hit some fees too


[10/09/2022 6:19 PM] H7#4402
thank you @haileypdll


[10/09/2022 6:19 PM] haileypdll#3353
Thanks


[10/09/2022 6:21 PM] H7#4402
Sorry last question, it’s normal to report 0 hash? Assume that will normalize once it solves a request


[10/09/2022 6:23 PM] haileypdll#3353
This gives the current hashrate, and report 0 when not mining. I take a note to replace it with a "-" or leave empty.


[10/09/2022 6:25 PM] H7#4402
Then my question is should it be mining right now? Is it just not mining because there are no available contracts to validate?


[10/09/2022 6:27 PM] haileypdll#3353
I think nobody created a contract. I will create a contract with 8 chars for 1 ERG now there is some computing power 😀


[10/09/2022 6:30 PM] H7#4402
Ok, got two servers running


[10/09/2022 6:30 PM] haileypdll#3353

[10/09/2022 6:32 PM] haileypdll#3353

Nice, validated a contract for 0.1


[10/09/2022 7:33 PM] H7#4402
Still working on what you launched for 1 erg


[10/09/2022 7:34 PM] H7#4402
Is there a way to pool hashrate together to validate


[10/09/2022 7:34 PM] H7#4402
If it’s localized or can be VPN’d on the same IP?


[10/09/2022 7:56 PM] haileypdll#3353
There is no check on IP or whatever. The first miner producing the replicated box with the right hash win the fee, so you can run several miners for the same address from different computers.


[10/09/2022 7:57 PM] H7#4402
Got it, but is this a possibility to aggregate that hash together


[10/09/2022 7:57 PM] H7#4402
Almost the same concept as pooling hash


[10/09/2022 7:57 PM] H7#4402
Vs solo mining


[10/09/2022 7:58 PM] H7#4402
If so there is also an interesting concept of smart contract mining either by individuals or traditional pools


[10/09/2022 7:59 PM] haileypdll#3353
There is no pooling implemented, only solo mining. It should be possible to mine to a smart contract distributing the fees to several address. But there is no counter that would distribute the gains depending on the contribution.

a day in still haven't solved the '88888888' pattern


[10/10/2022 7:35 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Yes, we can make snisps for pretty much any mining algorithm, including whatever is being used in these contracts. Here shares would be transactions, rather than block headers.


[10/10/2022 10:48 PM] haileypdll#3353
I had around 3500 H/s. Let say you have the same. There is 2^32 (4 billion) pattern like that. If we are average lucky, 2 billion to find the right one. => (2^31 /( 7000 * 3600 *24) then 3.5 days... we need more power 🙂


[10/10/2022 10:49 PM] haileypdll#3353
I will publish a more optimized version of the miner (nearly twice faster).


[10/10/2022 10:53 PM] haileypdll#3353
You would have some pointer on a document explaining how it works ?


[10/10/2022 10:59 PM] H7#4402
Awesome, hashrate is somewhat similar, my strongest cpu is doing 4500+ on a 5950x


[10/10/2022 11:04 PM] haileypdll#3353
ho, that beast, my 5900x was at 3300 H/s max with the released version. The next version will improve the things.

or a zip for windows?


[10/10/2022 11:17 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Will have a paper out when the hackathon ends. Though thinking again, this is not a standard PoW scheme (where  `H(w) < t`), but instead something more like `H(w) = t`. This makes things a bit more complicated, and I am not entirely sure the methods used for SNISPs may work here.


[10/10/2022 11:17 PM] haileypdll#3353
Ok, I'm pushing a release with windows zip.


[10/10/2022 11:17 PM] H7#4402
thank you @haileypdll


[10/10/2022 11:18 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
For example, there is no real concept of super-shares (like super-blocks in NiPoPoWs) here, as we are now trying to satisfy an equation rather than an inequality. Maybe a similar construction could be made though.


[10/10/2022 11:20 PM] haileypdll#3353
I don't really get how the blockhain (contract) would know how much hashrate is involved by the miner.


[10/10/2022 11:24 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
In our paper, we're setting up a sort of game with various parameters that ensure that the only option that a miner is incentivized to do inherently reveals their hashrate (or something close to it).


[10/10/2022 11:25 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
We're also leveraging the fact that there is a real limit on the number of hashes a miner can produce, and that a set of hashes which satisfies the standard PoW equation represents a binomial distribution.

[10/11/2022 1:02 AM] H7#4402
I might be trying to force too many processes


[10/11/2022 1:03 AM] H7#4402
Or there are limits on the amount the miner can do in tandem?


[10/11/2022 1:03 AM] H7#4402
25 process on both miners are pretty stable in the 4.1-4.5k hash range


[10/11/2022 8:00 AM] haileypdll#3353
Each miner is limited by the number of vCPU.


[10/11/2022 8:03 AM] haileypdll#3353
Strange, I've not made tests running two miners in parallel. I cannot really explain, the workload seems CPU bound in my test... but maybe there is another contention... There is now 2 requests for 8 character patterns, we will need more miners !


[10/11/2022 6:18 PM] haileypdll#3353
I've pushed a new version of the front end and of the miner to address an issue with the hash of the media of the tokens. This is a breaking change as the old miner will fail to mint tokens that include a media and that were generated by the previous version.

[10/12/2022 7:26 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Hey, @haileypdll! Awesome project you have here, congrats. I'm looking at your miner code and I think it can be greatly optimized if you use Fleet's `OutpuBuilder` for `boxId` calculation. BoxId calculation is not done yet, but I can do it relatively quick, if you want to give it a try.

Basically you won't need to assemble to whole transaction and do tons of async calls to calculate the boxId, instead you can simply do something like:

```ts
const builder = outputBuilder.setRegisters({R9: encodedNonce});
if(builder.calcBoxId().startsWith(requiredStartSequence) {
  // assemble the transaction here
  // ...
}
```


[10/12/2022 7:38 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Oh, I just saw that  `transactionId` is also required. It can take more time than I imagine 🤔


[10/12/2022 8:28 PM] haileypdll#3353
Thanks. Yes, and that's the biggest consumer curently.


[10/14/2022 10:02 AM] haileypdll#3353
It was clear that CYTI contracts allows to mint many tokens in a single transaction. Something I have discovered is that when the pattern requested is empty, the contracts resolve to True for any boxId, so the contract is already in the second state, "Mined". And this allows to process the token minting with the CYTI miner immediately.


[10/14/2022 5:47 PM] haileypdll#3353
30 tokens minted in one transaction: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/1c6ae8c44c493f6356a0e49afb5f2137267db5deda60c7e74d0ebc8e416f3ba8 (18 of them starting by "aa05" for testing purpose)

Yes, testing the limits, the cost, the feature. 150 CYTI requests in one transaction  failed when there was and URL and a hash due to the transaction size.


[10/15/2022 8:53 AM] haileypdll#3353
For 0.63 ERG, I've minted 150 different tokens, in one transaction (and 0.15 ERG were refundded). They all have a tokenID starting by '1111'. It seems to me a good feature for NFT creators making collections. https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/2993dae1a1f02ebc33c0adaa62923a7530c1b1dc0bf9f045a33d7672c6bfb6b3.

Basically just find and overwrite some bytes on known locations in the serialized transaction then calculate hash, repeat for serialized box with the newly calculated transaction id


[10/16/2022 9:51 PM] haileypdll#3353
Wow, that's great ! I was hoping someone will be able to do a fast miner. That soon, WOW.


[10/16/2022 9:56 PM] haileypdll#3353
Well, I'm also doing string replace to change the nonce... but the UnsignedTransaction build takes all the time. And I've not find a way to get the TransactionId by another mean.


[10/16/2022 9:57 PM] haileypdll#3353
Javascript miner... was funny... but will not run much...


[10/16/2022 9:57 PM] Telefragged#8068
I think the rust->wasm bindings are lacking in this regard anyways. Looks like you're converting to and from json just to recalculate IDs which is suboptimal hehe


[10/16/2022 9:58 PM] haileypdll#3353
With that... I can probably push to 10 char in the UI... and reduce again the fees


[10/16/2022 9:58 PM] Telefragged#8068
10 should be feasible, around 1 day I calculated earlier with just my cpu


[10/16/2022 10:02 PM] haileypdll#3353
Yes... for the ErgoBox... I could do better, with string manipulation instead of JSON. but most of the time is really in the UnsignedTransaction from js

Nice


[10/16/2022 10:49 PM] Telefragged#8068
I will make some improvements over the coming week, head is pretty fried today from figuring this out lol


[10/16/2022 10:49 PM] haileypdll#3353
Great, thanks


[10/16/2022 11:23 PM] haileypdll#3353
ho, I got it, you manipulate the bytes of the transaction directly and recompute the hash. Well done.


[10/16/2022 11:26 PM] H7#4402
Can anyone compile for windows?


[10/16/2022 11:33 PM] haileypdll#3353
the windows exe worked for me


[10/16/2022 11:33 PM] haileypdll#3353
(with the --release flag)

This is freaking fire. I watched the video and read the docs. Crazy achievement you've done in 2 weeks!


[10/20/2022 9:29 AM] haileypdll#3353
thanks, I had some amount of re-usable code, and took the project architechture from blobs-topia project... that speed up the things.


[10/20/2022 9:30 AM] haileypdll#3353
Some promising "little" improvement coming for the miner with the great help from Telefragged:

The new miner is available with the performance improved x700 using the ergo-cyti-wasm-nodejs library from Telefragged.

[10/22/2022 3:54 PM] H7#4402
Amazing!!

Thank you!


[10/22/2022 4:12 PM] H7#4402
@haileypdll Seems like there is still an issue with retrying to solve/validate a contract if the miner fails to solve the first time?


[10/22/2022 4:23 PM] haileypdll#3353
There is a transaction stuck in the mempool (with 666666 and 2222 patterns) since few hours, it is processed but still apears and fails to be sent because the inputs are already spent. It is the issue ?


[10/22/2022 6:15 PM] haileypdll#3353
A medium article to present the CYTI contract is available: https://medium.com/@Haileypdll/cyti-choose-your-token-id-2f2cf8f0f73f


[10/22/2022 6:18 PM] H7#4402
I think so


[10/22/2022 6:18 PM] H7#4402
Maybe that’s why I’m not continuing to mine it?


[10/22/2022 6:18 PM] H7#4402
Or it continues to come up?


[10/22/2022 6:50 PM] haileypdll#3353
They are mined once each time you launch the miner... Until the transaction disappears from the mempool.

[10/26/2022 5:51 PM] H7#4402
But congratulations to whoever hit it!


[10/26/2022 5:54 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Awesome, how many days did it take to be found?


[10/26/2022 6:57 PM] haileypdll#3353
It tooks around 2.5 days. Not sure of the hashrate allocated, we might have been a bit unlucky.


[10/26/2022 9:41 PM] H7#4402
I have about 10-12 mh/s total and didn't solve it


[10/26/2022 9:41 PM] H7#4402
biggest cpu is 5950x with 64gb


[10/26/2022 9:43 PM] H7#4402
does 5-6 mh/s


[10/27/2022 12:07 AM] haileypdll#3353
I was running 6mh/s between two computers, but I did not get it.


[10/27/2022 1:24 AM] fubinou#4628
Hi there, quick question. when i run the cyti miner, i see it processed two boxes for earnings of 0.0084, but in the end no resolved box found. what does it mean here ?

[10/27/2022 2:18 AM] H7#4402
Those two are stuck in the mempool


[10/27/2022 2:18 AM] H7#4402
For whatever reason


[10/27/2022 7:49 AM] haileypdll#3353
Hello, the transaction https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/8792de0f88ef59cbeacfb40d19203d6466117ef9076be8c266e3af8b2ef27853 is stuck in the mempool since several days and produces those two boxes. So the miner tries to mine them. The issue in the miner that should be fixed is that they should not be accounted in the earnings. I hope that somehow it will disappear from the mempool at some point...


[11/17/2022 4:20 PM] haileypdll#3353
WOW ! thanks ! CYTI winner ! I'm really happy you liked the project and I hope it will be useful to NFTs projects and dApps.


[12/06/2022 10:05 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Does cyti allow you to choose your own token identifier and then its YOURS? like no one else can choose the same one?


[12/20/2022 1:58 PM] haileypdll#3353
CYTI allows to choose the first characters of your token ID. But several people can create tokens starting with "0000" for example. Each token starting by 0000 will be unique.


[12/20/2022 2:06 PM] liquid_phase#4605
so it can't be said that a token identifier is specific to whoever claimed it first, since they can be re-claimed again and again, but the end of the strings would be different while the beginning was the same?


[12/20/2022 2:07 PM] haileypdll#3353
Yes exactly.


[12/20/2022 2:08 PM] liquid_phase#4605
might be pedantic, but couldnt that actually cause alot of false positives from first glances and people who don't put due diligence into research


[12/20/2022 2:09 PM] liquid_phase#4605
like, how would a noob to the ecosystem know if SWAMP05432wjiof90jfrenio was official and SWAMPntf3ir9enotf349j wasnt?


[12/20/2022 2:12 PM] haileypdll#3353
CYTI offers a feature, limited to the start of a token ID... it does not try to solve something else


[12/20/2022 2:12 PM] liquid_phase#4605
right i guess im just fussing about the word identifier when in reality its just a trade mark or brand stamp


[12/20/2022 2:14 PM] liquid_phase#4605
but, thats just me 🙂


[12/20/2022 2:14 PM] haileypdll#3353
Yes, you might mint a token with ID starting like SigUSD, and tries to scam people. It will be easier with CYTI.


[12/20/2022 2:14 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i personally wouldn't but i'm sure people will. I'm just wondering what is the intended use case for this?


[12/20/2022 2:17 PM] haileypdll#3353
For example, the following transaction generated with CYTI front-end has minted 150 tokens, all with ID starting by 1111. 
https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/2993dae1a1f02ebc33c0adaa62923a7530c1b1dc0bf9f045a33d7672c6bfb6b3


[12/20/2022 2:17 PM] liquid_phase#4605
so identifying airdrops?


[12/20/2022 2:17 PM] haileypdll#3353
you can mint an NFt collection with all the same begining, or with a pattern numbered


[12/20/2022 2:19 PM] haileypdll#3353
A dApp could check that the token was issued by CYTI contract, yes, and find the address that got them
