Perma-Ergo is a realfi project that seeks to employ Ergo blockchain technology in holistic natural
systems known as: Permaculture or Agroecology, through means of giving micro loans to farmers
who neither have access to either farmlands nor the financial means to give them accessibility to
land to cultivate, forming a vicious cycle spiraling to exclusion and poverty. Eventually the end goal
of Perma-Ergo is to encourage: Real World Food Production Decentralisation

Noah's assisting Ergo Foundation with the ergohack and they are gathering participants to see if people would be able to create a video presentation on the project each person has created. Ideally would need to have a video back 2 weeks or so following the hackathon. The videos will be shared publicly on the Ergo youtube channel as a way to share what the community has put together during the event! Would you be able/intersted? If not interested that is okay, and wish you best of luck with the rest of the hackathon

Yeah I think we are interested, to introduce each other to the rest of the community
