I sketched out the possible actions and rules to get a better overview for myself. Maybe others find it useful. Please let me know if something is incorrect.

As I said , dexy is too diverse for ai

I think latest midjourney is the best, but stopped my subscription


[12/10/2022 11:14 AM] HQ3rr#0000

So current state:

* made another round of review, Amitabh is doing fixes now and splitting huge LP contract into parts. Dexy could be most complex contract deployed
* as you know, oracle pool 2.0 delivering gold price is launched on the testnet, testing is going good so far
* we are starting testing contracts with real testnet transactions

 I noticed a Getblok pool mentioned to payout excessive reserve's, would it be better to utilize a smart contract rather than a community protocol to payout the excessive reserves?

Why? The more collateral the safer the stablecoin.


[01/08/2023 6:01 AM] Dan / ដេនញ៉ូ#0000
This design is simple and informative. I would make the whole logo a solid, bright gold color without shading. And write "DEXY GOLD". This would make the logo scalable, as in the future the logo could be changed to "DEXY COPPER" and the color changed to accordingly.

 It is a bit more complicated. Yes, more collateral is always good. But to get more collateral people have to be more interested.

 It is overcomplicated by the filled area in the center, at least.

(re @Dan / ដេនញ៉ូ : *Page 7: "It would be desirable to remove excess reserves"

 I kind of looked at it like so: With ERG as the reserve it is possible to have a large amount locked into the stable coin algo which means it would become stagnant in some sense and a stagnant currency creates a stagnant economy, since Erg is the underlying currency of the network and the network economy,the impact of having too much of it locked up has some unknowns associated with creating the central bank algo that way.

(re @Dan / ដេនញ៉ូ : *Page 7: "It would be desirable to remove excess reserves"

 Paying out profits for dev work and initial liquidity is fine. Cant get around those, unless someone feels generous.

That does not mean  it has to go on forever. Once a fair amount of profits are paid out, then the system could slowly shift the profits to support stability. (E.g. buying own LP tokens). 

Over time, those protocol owned LP tokens would push out everyone else, because it becomes capitally inefficient. That is great for a stablecoin, because it pumps the collateral ratio higher than what competitors can afford.

As Chris points out, it might be a problem if the POL accumulates indefinitely. Not so sure about the stagnant point, but a huge POL might increase an incentive for oracle price providers to collude.

So maybe there should be some very high collateral ratio cap, after which fees approach zero, or excess is paid out. Supportive functions should maybe get a cut anyway (mining and oracle).

 How does that "stagnant currency creates a stagnant economy" argument fit Ergo?

For fiat currencies, that is the argument for aiming to have low inflation. Ergo will not have inflation at some point. Same as bitcoin, they are somewhat stagnant by design.

At the extreme, dexy would lock some huge amount of erg. That would push up erg price. Why is it a problem?

 Maybe it does not fit ergo, might be no problems with ergs getting locked away in a algo, looking at how it could make price rise by indefinitely locking them into a treasury is an interesting thought.


[01/08/2023 8:07 PM] fruittree#0000
some people say the low liguidity on CEXs is a deterrent for big buyers. but it doesn't make a lot of sense to just look at one side. the other side is scarcity is an important part of a currency.

(re @Haskell_plus : *Maybe it does not fit ergo, might be no problems with ergs getting locked away in a algo, looking at how it could make price rise by indefinitely locking them into a treasury is an interesting thought.*) 
 
 I think locking them might limit liquidity problems if protocol use fluctuates. Like with sigusd, liquidity has to build up before it can really be useful. If the protocol use goes way down, it has to build itself back up again.


[01/08/2023 11:12 PM] kushti#0000
Overcollateralization is a sign of high price, and during that time the protocol should be prepared for dips coming, minting lp tokens is a good way to prepare for it.


[01/08/2023 11:14 PM] kushti#0000
And then eg half of lp tokens can be burnt, half can be paid out after long enough timelock, if stablecoin backing is still good.

[01/18/2023 3:10 AM] PlanDrip#0000
(re  : *<Reqlez> One is USD, and the other is GOLD  😏*) 
 
 But to me it sounds more like Luna UST


[01/18/2023 3:24 AM] TIMRΣG7#0000
Read the paper. One token, two protocols. Luna had two tokens and used seigniorage.


[01/18/2023 3:24 AM] TIMRΣG7#0000

Name another token that maintains its peg through arbitrage.

(re  : *<cafebedouin> Name another token that maintains its peg through arbitrage.*) 
 
 Okay but that's how I thought Luna and ust worked by arbitrage. I guess I was wrong.


[01/18/2023 4:11 AM] NoahErgo#0000
(re  : *<cafebedouin> Name another token that maintains its peg through arbitrage.*) 
 
 New curve stablecoin whitepaper has a kind of similar amm mechanism


[01/18/2023 11:38 AM] cafebedouin#9837
I'm not deep into stablecoin concepts, but I think the main difference is that Dexy is like SigmaUSD and tries to solve maintaining the peg through locks and incentives whereas curve tries to solve via smart contracts. When I think arbitrage, I am thinking of human in the loop, or automated bots that responding to those incentives rather than the protocol itself doing the arbitrage. But, entirely possible I don't understand either protocol very well. I generally have to use something to get a feel for how things work.

 Baseline for the Ui ux is green because it will be interesting and playable with other stuff too


[03/11/2023 7:04 PM] hq3r#0000

 With icon we can do green gradient stroke and just use Inside text and BG bars color of mineral too


[03/11/2023 9:58 PM] TIMRΣG7#0000
Those icons weren't my favorite but they do match with that logo & color scheme

(re @crimsoncryptos : *Why choose green?🤔 i think its better in gold colour, just my opinion*) 
 
 It makes sense as dexy is a framework for lots of pegged assets, not just gold!


[03/16/2023 1:43 AM] Bullskey#6363
@cafebedouin what do you mean by first version will be pegged to gold ?


[03/16/2023 1:44 AM] cafebedouin#9837
See gazza's comment above.


[03/16/2023 1:44 AM] Bullskey#6363
so Dexy would be a basket of assets


[03/16/2023 1:44 AM] Bullskey#6363
wouldnt that just be an ETF


[03/16/2023 1:45 AM] cafebedouin#9837
No Dexy is designed to be pegged to a commodity, I believe.


[03/16/2023 1:45 AM] Bullskey#6363
"a" commodity or multiple


[03/16/2023 1:45 AM] cafebedouin#9837
But, you could then combine into another meta asset of a different design.


[03/16/2023 1:45 AM] Bullskey#6363
is there any paper on what dexygold is ?

(re @crimsoncryptos : *Why choose green?🤔 i think its better in gold colour, just my opinion*) 
 
 Green color is a generic choice for money because it looks calm, passive, like income

1/n In theory, $DJED could have different currency-pegged stablecoins share the same collateral, then have an oracle-based DEX that requires no counterparty by allowing exchange of different stablecoins based on oracle-values. #Cardano

(re @kushti_ru : *Sure, no need to ask me about such things but ...*)
        
        My idea is to create a certificate of deposit (CD) on Ergo. The CD will inflate its native token a set percentage per year. Inflation is distributed to token holders via staking. Longer and bigger stakes get a higher percentage of the inflation. Every time a stake ends the amount of tokens required to capture the same amount of inflation increases.

        No founder allocation. No rugpull. Just the open market. Defi degens locking up funds.

On EVM it's simpler and you can just call some functions of the deployed contract, on Ergo it's a bit more tedious


[04/09/2023 8:20 PM] TIMRΣG7#0000
I really agree. I've been building a mental model of ergo to help create positive feedback loops, and I've come to something like the time-value of ERG held as the key metric. We need protocols like this, like dexy, like sigusd, etc that encourage people to lock up their funds.

Is Saudi Arabia Selling Oil To China For Gold?
Rumors are making rounds that Saudi Arabia is selling oil for yuan, which it converts into gold on the Shanghai International Gold Exchange (SGEI).

Dexy Stablecoin | Coming soon to Ergo (@Dexy_Ergo)
Dexy uses 1 token & 2 protocols 

1⃣: On-chain AMM for trading Dexy against ERG 

2⃣: Algorithmic bank that intervenes when market price differs from target price set by an oracle. The bank mints Dexy tokens by selling them for ERG and uses ERG reserves for intervention

I’m excited with Dexy design. However I have a question:

Is there a ratio: LP Dexy / (Total Dexy - Algo bank Dexy) ?

I think Dexy in LP should keep a ratio to free Dexy or we will depeg during the bank run

        Just a bit 😅 but plenty of upside. I think that and rBTC will be good middle ground for people

Forwarded from TIMRΣG7: So I just watched a video on this gold storage company in Singapore. It made me think about using them to issue a token backed by physical gold.

Banks crashing! Bitcoin + Physical Gold/Silver instead
Is Physical Gold WITHOUT counterparty risk even possible? In this video we interview Silver Bullion CEO Gregor Gregersen, who has perhaps the ONLY solution to this problem in the world. Life changing video! We discuss the gold price, silver stacking, digital gold vs physical gold, and how to ACTUALLY opt out of a crashing fiat system.

Not sure of the value of having a physically backed protocol in addition to algorithmic. Just different risks


[04/30/2023 7:22 PM] fruittree#0000
physical backing leads to having more for regulators to point at afaik. Also has more of a single point of possible failure / corruption.

        Yep. Check out that video. Guy gives a good interview about their vaults and how their business seeks to reduce counterparty risk as much as possible
