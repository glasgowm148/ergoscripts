[03/22/2022 6:52 PM] So#0000
I mean... somebody making a comet pool is going to presumably end up with a pool:
 - tiny enough to be bought out with ease (on token or erg)
 - so far off the actual comet price because of how easy it will be to manipulate, that it will be profitable to empty the pool...
Why would someone make an erg/comet pool?


[03/22/2022 6:53 PM] So#0000
Or rather, why *did* someone? I'm sure any of us could likely empty it..


[03/22/2022 6:54 PM] koutelier#0000
i don't think anyone would sell comet this cheap


[03/22/2022 6:56 PM] So#0000
Oh! Fees! That's why!


[03/22/2022 6:56 PM] So#0000
It's a fees scam. That makes sense.


[03/22/2022 6:56 PM] So#0000
You can't empty it of erg or comet; the ratios on both sides are terrible


[03/22/2022 6:56 PM] So#0000
because the fees devour everything to put in


[03/22/2022 6:57 PM] So#0000
...doesn't that mean you could add liquidity to it and basically just be bellying up to the scam bar eating fees from people who bother with it?

No, but anyone can


[03/23/2022 4:09 PM] Maarten_V#0000
Might open a small one myself with my own money till the founders will start a reall one. ICO is the fun part to open it at the same time as the pool


[03/23/2022 4:42 PM] BONZO#0000
I think 0.3% LP fee is the most commonly used pools for swaps

[03/23/2022 9:47 PM] So#0000
Why I wonder is it doing this? Whatever the case, neat. I'm not going to care until erg hits 400k per erg though. Hodl.

How's the trip going, you ask? Well.... 
Spoke with several projects about utilizing Atala, several more about building on #Cardano, another bunch about building on #Ergo, two liquidity providers for Ergo & two exchanges about listing $ERG....
All in the past 48hrs.

well, as long you get out in time, you can just throw a dart at stuff and once BTC pumps everything else pumps. The question however you got to ask is it pumping harder as bitcoin and then your doing fine


[03/23/2022 10:24 PM] So#0000
But I bought at that price the amount I wanted to hold to wait for bigger losses, not so I could just sell at the price I bought at


[03/24/2022 12:50 AM] Maarten_V#0000
Nice the pool is now 2.4K big already

$COMET the #memecoin has appeared on @ErgoDex 
After 6 months of engineering like #Cardano $ADA is used to. 
#ERGO $ERG community presents:
A useless token $COMET that is able to be mixed and soon to be mined and staked. 

Refundable ICO coming weeks!

It’s 20 NETA/USD$

[03/24/2022 11:18 AM] BONZO#0000
Why this difference?


[03/24/2022 11:21 AM] Maarten_V#0000

But such a huge difference man. I’m getting 5 times Neta than I’m getting cneta at the same price


[03/24/2022 11:25 AM] BONZO#0000
And they both have the same supply


[03/24/2022 11:25 AM] BONZO#0000
50% cneta and 50% neta


[03/24/2022 11:26 AM] Maarten_V#0000
not financial advice: but abritrage the shit out of things can be quite profitable


[03/24/2022 11:26 AM] BONZO#0000
There are a combined total of two billion (2,000,000,000) anetaBTC protocol tokens and is hard-capped at this amount.
  1,000,000,000 (50%) of these anetaBTC protocol tokens will be on Ergo as NETA.
  1,000,000,000 (50%) of these anetaBTC protocol tokens will be on Cardano as cNETA.
Combined, NETA and cNETA tokens represent a 100% governance and revenue-sharing stake for the entire anetaBTC protocol.
Each and every NETA and cNETA token has an equivalent stake in the anetaBTC protocol.

Neta has always been way the hell cheaper than cNETA. For a simple and obvious reason:
When you have ada, you demand other coins because whatever it's ada.
When you have ergo,. other coins are little play things with low demand, because they're whatever, you have ergo


[03/24/2022 12:38 PM] So#0000

Since $COMET degenerates are making $COMET pools on their own in @ErgoDex  . We will provide the liquidity right away and thus officially are launched on @ErgoDex .

[03/24/2022 4:09 PM] So#0000
I presumed they *would* based on that tweet, but I didn't think they did because the pools still only a few thousand dollars in liquidity. The presale loaded their bags wayyyy richer than a couple thousand


[03/24/2022 4:09 PM] So#0000
I'm sure they have a great deal more liquidity to add

Nope.


[03/24/2022 4:13 PM] So#0000
Presale was:
Send ergs to address X
Receive 200k comet per erg
You could see in explorer the confirmations happening on address X
People sent a significant amount of ergs.

Not million no- and that's surprising, I perhaps misread the erg amounts I saw in explorer during presale. It looked like some people were pumping hundreds of ergs into presale - I was expecting thousands of ergs in liquidity but that's my bad then

they sent 2106 ergs

[03/25/2022 2:05 PM] cokoty#0000
> *(re @C4lculista)*: bridge soon 
but they would have to provide enough liquidity for bridge, since final amount of tokens is already minted on both sides. becouse of that, it could happen in first days, that lot of people send from ergo to ada, so bridge contract run out of tokens on ada side and you wont be adle to bridge anymore, untile more liquidity is added or somebody bridge his tokens otherwise

i just expect this, becouse usualy, when you build bridge, you have minting contract on side, which doesnt have token yet. In this case, tokens are already minted, so you cannot have minting contract again, you need to hove liquidity pool. And you know, how those pools works...

yeah, they building neta fund with ada from their pools, then farming MIN by providing liquidity and they will also store those fees for use of bridge

not that one sir


[03/25/2022 5:23 PM] JOFLITO#0000
it is a governance token


[03/25/2022 5:23 PM] JOFLITO#0000
and it will share profits from wrapping BTC to erg and Cardano


[03/25/2022 5:24 PM] JOFLITO#0000
the token will have the exact same voting power and rewards regardless of the chain


[03/25/2022 5:24 PM] JOFLITO#0000
so the price will be the same


[03/25/2022 5:24 PM] JOFLITO#0000
because is the same token


[03/25/2022 5:24 PM] cokoty#0000
yeah, those profits from fund i mentioned


[03/25/2022 5:24 PM] JOFLITO#0000
like having a usd bill or a usd in your bank account


[03/25/2022 5:24 PM] JOFLITO#0000
it is the same


[03/25/2022 5:24 PM] JOFLITO#0000

true


[03/25/2022 5:25 PM] JOFLITO#0000
the fund is not from liquidity


[03/25/2022 5:25 PM] JOFLITO#0000
nor farming or anything


[03/25/2022 5:25 PM] JOFLITO#0000
the profits are from btc wrapping

anetaBTC wraps BTC into Ergo and Cardano. They will charge a fee for it, and that revenue from wrapping fees will be distributed to neta and cNeta holders equally


[03/25/2022 5:30 PM] JOFLITO#0000

if you want to buy $COMET wait for refundable ico


[03/25/2022 5:34 PM] DocFil#0000
If the ICO is later maybe the ADA has doubled from the min of the pool


[03/25/2022 5:40 PM] JOFLITO#0000
> *(re @DocFil)*: If the ICO is later maybe the ADA has doubled ... 
ICO is kinda close


[03/25/2022 5:40 PM] JOFLITO#0000
the contract is ready


[03/25/2022 5:40 PM] JOFLITO#0000
needs auditing


[03/25/2022 5:40 PM] DocFil#0000
Wow


[03/25/2022 5:41 PM] DocFil#0000
Then don't let the company do it which ignored the minswap bug

Wrapped tokens don’t necessarily need to be priced the same. As far as I know wrapped neta on cardano and cneta could be different in price I guess since wrapped neta is bridged from ergo to cardano

We will enlist Binance once we are done


[03/25/2022 7:05 PM] Maarten_V#0000
Binance cannot survive on it's own. It's centralized and it needs to survive within $COMET it's growing ecosystem

Wait, can I refund a hotdog for comet?


[03/25/2022 8:28 PM] Maarten_V#0000
I have not seen the code but i am sure it's based on the one we tryed ourselves as well


[03/25/2022 8:29 PM] Maarten_V#0000
basically you get a "i owe you" token after you sended $ERG for $COMET

that "i owe you" token is your key to refund $COMET for $ERG as long you got the amount of $COMET

Only fitting. If you want to be burned by $COMET, we will make it available to finish it off.  😂

The top 10 addresses that burned the most will go to a raffle and will something ?

Great idea . Maybe the community should ask for it

in order to access the VIP features

Sir,
They approached you to check if you were ok?


[03/29/2022 2:45 AM] So#0000
CEXes can't support Ergo tokens yet because they have weird modified old nodes I believe?


[03/29/2022 2:47 AM] So#0000
The few that have Ergo at all.
Seems strange that they would but if they didn't I guess they couldn't keep all their users wallets under their control more of virtual wallets I guess


[03/29/2022 2:51 AM] JOFLITO#0000
they didn't approach me for $COMET


[03/29/2022 2:51 AM] JOFLITO#0000

[03/29/2022 3:58 PM] So#0000
Oh! And I just heard yesterday that he's making great progress on the subpool's code! I think COMETs existence in his beta code is a beautiful way to degen against erg :D


[03/29/2022 3:59 PM] So#0000
Create a secure box holding comet that requires GetBlok to...prove a block was created (height?) and then it accepts a TX of N $COMET output to the miners? I'm in. I mine on GetBlok already


[03/29/2022 4:00 PM] So#0000
I don't know precisely how that kind of box management can be done without GetBlok just being the sole owner of the box it's distributing from, like when it had a box of vote tokens it was distributing from

It should be under a contract


[03/29/2022 4:03 PM] So#0000
GuapSwap would be impacting liquidity in the dex and having significantly less incentivization for people to mine it out; the GetBlok idea that miners earn COMET also is great and incentivizes it.
Using a SubPool you guys could control the treasury box as you already do so owning the key to pass out COMET and take away a little erg from each block. You'd effectively be setting a rate; 1 erg = N comet - a block is created with...500 some odd ergs? You take one and hand out N comet.

You get erg and comet, and comet grows less available with time while acting as...actually a stable L2.

Mining it means some could end up with boatloads and create realistic sized pools for it against SigUSD and other coins so people can use it for swaps instead of Ergo to buy ErgoPad, NETA, etc

Stable coin. We have SigUSD but the ageUSD protocol is showing flaws in lacking RSV incentivization;
Could reach out about making COMET an RSV purchaser bonus to incentivize people to maintain the reserve weight.
Alternatively it's been suggested multiple times to have an Oracle based stable coin; can host a system that allows swaps between COMET and COMETBUCK that uses oracles to guarantee exchange rate so COMETBUCK costs $1 of COMET.

depending how much $COMET gets tested on the ICO and how much people will use it/shill it.  I assume the price goes toward ICO price and then well it's everybody it's geuss.

regardless of ticket sold?

yes sir


[04/05/2022 6:38 PM] JOFLITO#0000
and the same ticket must have gold + another one to get the jackpot

exactomundo


[04/05/2022 6:38 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
that’s what makes their odds smaller

I see, really interesting


[04/05/2022 6:38 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
and if no winner for jackpot, pot gets bigger


[04/05/2022 6:39 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
for next draw


[04/05/2022 6:39 PM] JOFLITO#0000

how much for the ticket?

Very Bullish on Comet. Miners rewards will force people to hodl more. We have a good amount of people who would hodl like ERG I think. Maybe we should do a Poll in Miners Group

All COMET NFTs, are graded, Beggar, Cooper, Silver, Gold... 
So, each grade has some value...
So why not intregated COMET NFTs on the staking process...
I propose to stake COMET tokens but also COMET NFTs...
What do you think?


[04/09/2022 10:20 PM] BridgeBot#9505
REROLABS Yes ppl holding comet nfts get a staking bonus

JOFLITO true


[04/10/2022 12:31 AM] BridgeBot#9505
REROLABS Comet nft wud need a smart contract


[04/10/2022 12:31 AM] Zzzz#0000
For instance, if you stake:
- a gold NFT + wl token, we mutiply your staking rewards by x1.1 (or without wl token, by x1.05)
- a silver NFT + wl token, we mutiply your staking rewards by x1.2 (or without wl token, by x1.1)
- a copper NFT + wl token, we mutiply your staking rewards by x1.3 (or without wl token, by x1.15)
- a beggar NFT + wl token, we mutiply your staking rewards by 1.4 (or without wl token, by x1.2)

That's true degen COMET spirit...


[04/10/2022 12:31 AM] REROLABS#0000

Recently I have had people ask me; “why buy #Ergo if I have #Cardano?” I want to take a minute and answer this question. NFA, just my opinion. 
Both are revolutionary blockchains with world class teams. But there are differences. Let’s start with an important one, tokenomics.

 You turn computer on. Electricity gets used. You use tools to mine $ERG but it automatically gets swapped for $COMET. So you don't 'pay' to get rekt. You mine to get rekt.  It's a improvement

 you need a powerful dedicated gpu to mine any decent amount of ergo. Fortunately the price has been going down. Only $1500USD for a 3080ti.

There is this New NFT market for ERgo NFTs called Sky Harbor 👏👍
Questions are: 
1) why call this Comet Gamblers? why not Just "Comet".  
2) why so many mint addresses? Are they all guanine.

[04/18/2022 7:21 PM] Maarten_V#0000
Lets first see if even 10 billion hit the market after ICO. All other tokens will be mined and staked slowly after that so the total amount might be far less available

 A tool you can use to mine $COMET. Basically you mine $COMET and it swaps automatically to other tokens it can on the ERGO chain


[04/18/2022 8:20 PM] Maarten_V#0000

 I have another wallet installed on nautilus already. But for my main wallet I dont want to type the seed phrase anywhere. I just use the public address to send funds. I thought it would be possible to import it as read-only but I dont have this extended address

you send your stake key


[04/21/2022 3:40 PM] JOFLITO#0000
get a higher allocation than you would get alone


[04/21/2022 3:41 PM] JOFLITO#0000
and then recieve your tokens back


[04/21/2022 3:41 PM] JOFLITO#0000
the risk would be me running away with your stake key


[04/21/2022 3:41 PM] JOFLITO#0000
or fucking it up


[04/21/2022 3:41 PM] JOFLITO#0000
and sending you a stake key that isn't yours lol


[04/21/2022 3:47 PM] vmelev#0000
The Aneta guys with their LISO pools are doing something similar.
All based on Trust though.

In the early days of a chain Trust is high and risk taking is also high.
So let me lay aside some millions of commet for the upcoming commet club.

If Rugged, 
Well how unlucky are those who rug a shit coin.

But if it grows, 
That can end up being the first and most influential club on ergo.

 For COMET staking ?


[04/22/2022 12:36 PM] Maarten_V#0000
It’s a plan Jose has for letting people get a better return on their ergopad stake


[04/22/2022 12:37 PM] Maarten_V#0000
Combining stakekeys to get in a higher tier to get higher returns


[04/22/2022 12:38 PM] Maarten_V#0000
Basically creating a trustfund

 it is a launchpad on ergo, depending on how much staked tokens you have you get to different tiers that let you buy project tokens in presale

a small % of the lottery or rekttory can go to nft holders as well for the comet holders .

[04/25/2022 2:58 PM] So#0000
> So re @glasgowm: what is seed data 
 
 The charts have data from two places:

 1. I run a simple scraping process that digs out all of the box swaps that have happened for ErgoDEX from the public explorer and creates the initial seed for what you see - it's a static data set at https://jimmyhoffa.github.io/ergo-market-charts/ticker.json

 2. The page stores the last 5000 prices for each token in chrome's local storage, and every 10 minutes it will check for new token prices - if the price has changed, it adds that to the charts and the local stored prices

I don't run the scrape to update the seed that often, but each time you go to the site it will add data to your local storage to give you some data since last time I updated seed

[04/25/2022 2:59 PM] So#0000
If you check the site frequently, it will look like the data isn't too stale, if you check once in a while the charts will start having long runs of straight lines from last time you checked to the current moments update etc

Jumping Spiders in SLOW MOTION!
Welcome to the invisible world of jumping spiders.

These little guys put on an energetic show for us all in the blink of an eye. 

Luckily we were able to film them on our 4K high speed camera at around 2000 frames per second using a macro lens to capture the mechanics of their movements.

[04/29/2022 10:21 PM] So#0000
Eh, sort of. If you know another language you can do it on a backend - ErgoPad does all there TX building in Python on the backend because I think they're lacking JS (honestly the entire Ergo ecosystem is really lacking JS people, lots of folks with more science / maths backgrounds which makes sense for crypto)


[04/29/2022 10:22 PM] JOFLITO#0000
well, if you know how to copy ErgoPad code and use it

haha negative. Like I said, they do it in python, I tend to avoid python. I can help give guidance and feedback and review on JS though happily. I've actively avoided formally joining any projects in Ergo just because I don't have time to be committed to really consistently working on anything. 20 minutes here and there to give guidance and help troubleshoot / understand things for people learning I can find

How does it work if we are already comet holders and buy extra from the refundable ICO?
Are the refundable ICO Comet non-fungible or is our address being flagged for a max refund amount based on ICO volume?


[05/04/2022 3:26 PM] Maarten_V#0000
basically you get a key at the refundable ico wich says how much $COMET you bought and how much $ERG. That key is the most important part


[05/04/2022 3:27 PM] Maarten_V#0000
let's imagine the world is stupid and 1 $ERG becomes 20.000 $COMET


[05/04/2022 3:27 PM] JOFLITO#0000

 you recieve a refund token, for refund you need to send the refund token + comet


[05/04/2022 3:28 PM] Maarten_V#0000
you sell your $COMET and now you got no $COMET.  You can't refund either as you need the $COMET to refund.  But now lets imagine the world is sane once more and the price dropped to 1 $ERG to 500.000 $COMET.


[05/04/2022 3:28 PM] Maarten_V#0000
You buy the $COMET for cheap, send the $COMET back to the ico and you get your $ERG back wich was valued for a higher price


[05/04/2022 3:30 PM] Maarten_V#0000
it's about the $COMET and the key you get. the $ERG is 'safe' for a few years

 So if you fear risk and are anticipating a rug within the next 3 years, then use the refundable ICO.

$Comet putting its $ERG where its mouth is- the chances for the founders (or you, for that matter) to make any 💰out of this are as 0 as its worth.
Buy #comet  through the link in the quoted tweet and get your $ERG refunded anytime you want in the next three (3) years!

I don't know that anybody rugged anybody actually with Comet. I think the price just kinda went down because folks who did presale or otherwise earned comets off chow chows sold them.
Yes though, refundable ICO is genius; what were those devs thinking

years ago i used to be in keto and higher in fat. but i discovered the best way for me to lose fat is burn existing body fat instead of putting more fat into it. also monounsaturated fat have higher thermic effect and better for fat loss than saturated.
lean beef would be nice, but those grassfinished beef aint cheap

[05/07/2022 1:37 AM] cardelayno#0000
there is a feedback mechanism in your body that cause the body to keep raising glucose when you keep your insulin so low for too long.  keto people who do low carb for too long experience this and they keep going lower and lower in carb and feel terrible. when you eat a banana at this point the resting blood sugar actually go down afterward.
carb cause more tryptophan to go into brain, which is related to melatonin production, in the pineal gland. also insulin is required for thyroid function. this is why through my time being in keto i heard a lot of keto people having issues with sleep. once i started adding carb back i slept a lot better.


[05/07/2022 1:41 AM] cardelayno#0000
carb cause you to store more water (glycogen), so you lose a lot of water weight along with electrolyte when you go low carb. the thing is, for survival situation like shtf or in a desert, you dont want to go keto for this reason.

 Refund ticket sir


[05/07/2022 5:09 PM] koutelier#0000
It doesn’t have to be 21b


[05/07/2022 5:20 PM] babygrenade#0000
So... the refund ticket basically works like a put option?


[05/07/2022 5:21 PM] babygrenade#0000
Did comet release what is essentially the first options contract on ergo?


[05/07/2022 5:33 PM] JOFLITO#0000

 If I knew what a put option is I could answer that question

Put Option: How It Works and Examples
A put option grants the right to the owner to sell some amount of the underlying security at a specified price, on or before the option expires.

(re @koutelier : **) 
 
 Is that full supply for the refundable ICO or is that the total Supply of all Comet tokens?
or are those test comets?


[05/07/2022 5:38 PM] babygrenade#0000
if the refund tickets are tradable and can be redeemed by an address other than the original address it was issued to, then it looks like a put contract to me


[05/07/2022 5:39 PM] babygrenade#0000
which seems like a big deal


[05/07/2022 5:39 PM] koutelier#0000

[05/07/2022 5:44 PM] JOFLITO#0000
(re @Jalaldinho : *Burning?*) 
 
 well, you need comet + refund ticket to get erg from the contract


[05/07/2022 5:45 PM] JOFLITO#0000
so if we hide refund tickets


[05/07/2022 5:45 PM] JOFLITO#0000
and use it with comet from ergoDex we could steal


[05/07/2022 5:45 PM] JOFLITO#0000
so we locked refund tickets on the contract and burned the rest


[05/07/2022 5:46 PM] Jalaldinho#0000

[thread]: maybe even for the better


[05/07/2022 7:05 PM] babygrenade#0000
[thread]: let me know if you guys figure it out... It does look like it's essentially an options contract.  A platform to issue and trade options contracts (you wouldn't want to trade them in an AMM system like ErgoDex) opens up a lot of DeFi possibilities


[05/07/2022 7:08 PM] koutelier#0000
[thread]: i think i know what you mean now. it's not like an option . you have 3 weeks to buy comet refundable ico and then you can only refund


[05/07/2022 7:09 PM] babygrenade#0000
[thread]: a put option is a contract that lets you sell an asset at a set price


[05/07/2022 7:10 PM] babygrenade#0000
the refund mechanism is essentially letting you sell at a set price, no?


[05/07/2022 7:10 PM] babygrenade#0000
you're getting your original ERG back, but I could instead sell the ticket to someone else who could then cash out for my original ERG


[05/07/2022 7:11 PM] babygrenade#0000
the refund ticket expires after some set time right? 3 years?


[05/07/2022 7:12 PM] koutelier#0000
oh yeah. you can do that. that person will have to buy comets again though .or you could sell them together with the tickets. you need comet +tickets so if comet moons then your refundable ico ticket won't worth much.


[05/07/2022 7:12 PM] koutelier#0000
[thread]: yeah


[05/07/2022 7:13 PM] babygrenade#0000
say i sell my ticket to someone else


[05/07/2022 7:13 PM] babygrenade#0000
the price of comet to erg drops to 10% of it's value


[05/07/2022 7:13 PM] koutelier#0000
because the current prize is 1 erg = 150k 
if comet value is 1 erg = 100k comet then i don't thing anyone would want to refund . or buy the refund tickets


[05/07/2022 7:13 PM] babygrenade#0000
the person who bought my tickets can then buy cheap comet and refund to the original price


[05/07/2022 7:15 PM] babygrenade#0000
in fact you might want to buy the refund ticket if you think comet will drop below the set price, or if you like comet and are long comet but want to hedge your bet


[05/07/2022 7:16 PM] babygrenade#0000
anyway, I've got to run.  I think you guys might have something bigger than you realize on your hands, or at least an early prototype for something much bigger


[05/07/2022 7:16 PM] koutelier#0000
[thread]: also eventually this will be on ergodex eventually .the plan was to run this on ergodex but ergodex team is busy with the bridge atm

What realy happened that ust lost stability? I did not follow. Is it an issue that can happen to sigusd too?


[05/11/2022 6:48 PM] Maarten_V#0000
No.


[05/11/2022 6:48 PM] Maarten_V#0000
Sigusd and Djed (basically the same thing)  are overcollaterized stablecoins


[05/11/2022 6:49 PM] Maarten_V#0000
in theory it could happen btw, but something far more drastic as abusing the anchor needs to happen


[05/11/2022 6:51 PM] Maarten_V#0000
Noone knows exactly what happened, except that it was a clear ponzi from the start. The machanism had to little 'support' the peg of 1 dollar.  So a downturn would force the anchor to release more Luna wich puts more pressure downwards


[05/11/2022 6:51 PM] Maarten_V#0000
basically creating a deathspiral


[05/11/2022 6:52 PM] Maarten_V#0000
Lot of people on twitter where almost daily making people aware that they are in a ponzi, but people get greedy or plain don't understand or did not read how it works.

 Yes, it's sickening.  But don't be surprised the same exact thing will happen again but then in a different field of crypto next cycle

Today marks my 1st year as an #Ergonaut - came in with $ERG at ATH. The dips that followed didn't register because I was getting to know Ergo and my convinction only grew (and grows).
It surprises me how happy this makes me. Come celebrate with me! 🥳🥂

 actually like the idea. Would not know how to implement it though.  Making a few options like get $COMET as stake. Burn $COMET at stake and receive nothing.  Could be funny


[05/21/2022 1:16 PM] Maarten_V#0000
or should it be burn $COMET at the stake


[05/21/2022 1:17 PM] Maarten_V#0000
the problem with burning is that there needs to be a transaction to make it happen


[05/21/2022 1:21 PM] Zzzz#0000
(re @Maarten_V : *the problem with burning is that there needs to be a transaction to make it happen*) 
 
 Well, when someone reaches x $comet of staking rewards, we must give him the choice to withdraw or to burn his rewards...
If he withdraws, fine...
If he decides to burn the rewards, burn them, and in return increase his APY % to keep him staking!


[05/21/2022 1:21 PM] Maarten_V#0000
the transaction needs to be payed by the one staking however at that moment.  I mean i don't mind, but thats my logic


[05/21/2022 1:22 PM] Maarten_V#0000
and the apy can't change


[05/21/2022 1:22 PM] Maarten_V#0000
it's 1 smart contract


[05/21/2022 1:24 PM] Maarten_V#0000
@C4lculista tierd smart contracts with nft as proof sounds like very much work to me, lol


[05/21/2022 1:25 PM] Maarten_V#0000
but making people burn stuff to get more apy is kind of funny


[05/21/2022 1:25 PM] koutelier#0000
Well we need sc for that and basically ergo rent prevents you to burn trough sc


[05/21/2022 1:25 PM] koutelier#0000
We have to manually burn them with a script


[05/21/2022 1:25 PM] koutelier#0000

[05/21/2022 1:26 PM] koutelier#0000
I will make a burn page at some point


[05/21/2022 1:26 PM] koutelier#0000
Staking will have to wait

(re @Maarten_V : *the transaction needs to be payed by the one staking however at that moment.  I mean i don't mind, but thats my logic*) 
 
 Staker's choice, staker's move, staker pays...
How ?
When he withdraws, he gets rewards minus transaction fee...
When he burns, he burns rewards minus transaction fee, and for his bold move, gets a bonus in APY % to keep him staking...
That's completely COMET spirit...


[05/21/2022 1:29 PM] Maarten_V#0000
it could be done with locked staking i assume. the deal is you hold 6 months and get 20% apy to burn. The moment the lock ends and the person wants his 'rewards' he needs to send the transaction fee to get his / her $COMET back and simultaniously get send to a burning adress


[05/21/2022 1:31 PM] Maarten_V#0000
i mean, we got to beat luna with APY now

 For most tokens, APY decreases through time...
We could make it increase through time, only and only if you continuously burn rewards from stakings!

Ilya from sigma valley will solve this problem though with his dapp


[05/21/2022 1:36 PM] Maarten_V#0000
the problem is we can't alter the rewards as it will be 1 SC.  You don't want to inflate it to fast nor to slow. But a slower inflation is probably prefered over time. You can curve the rewards compared to the $COMET in the market but thats all

3 months 20% or something after that you get the right to burn 30% then 40% etc


[05/21/2022 1:59 PM] Maarten_V#0000
burned 20% for 6 months get 1% more apy


[05/21/2022 1:59 PM] Maarten_V#0000
or 100%


[05/21/2022 1:59 PM] Maarten_V#0000
burning, that is

[05/21/2022 2:54 PM] Zzzz#0000
(re @koutelier : *so either way he keeps it or he burn them ? but if he burn the rewards are increasing ?*) 
 
 His APY increases for his next staking period...


[05/21/2022 3:03 PM] Zzzz#0000
For instance, at first staking, everyone gets 4% APY...
We have to stake at least 3 months, once period is over, the staker claim rewards...
He has 2 options:
- withdraw his 4% rewards (minus transaction fee) to keep them and stake again at a 4% APY...
- withdraw his 4% rewards (minus transaction fee) to a burning wallet, and stake his holdings again at a 8% APY...
The more a staker burns, higher APY should be granted to him... But when he decides to keep rewards of staking once, his next staking commitment should be downgraded to the beginning of 4% APY...
APY rates start from 4%, but it gets double after each burn to 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048%...
But if after a burn at 128%, a staker gets 256% decides to keep rewards, he can stake again, but only back to 4%...


[05/21/2022 3:04 PM] koutelier#0000

Hello @koutelier 🖐️. I'm not sure if my wallet is registered. If I have an NFT, that's how it should be, right? I tried to register them here but I get an error...


[05/21/2022 9:34 PM] koutelier#0000

 well it is again proofing today to be the worst advice i can give, The anchor protocol went up with 200% today.  It can only go higher after this.

For exemple, comet partners with ErgoPad, someone gets rewards from staking ErgoPad tokens, could also receive equivalent rewards of $Comet as sub-staking incentives...

 the best things is to give more uses for comet


[05/23/2022 8:49 PM] koutelier#0000
like lottery


[05/23/2022 8:49 PM] koutelier#0000
perhaps nft listing for comet if anon approves it


[05/23/2022 8:49 PM] koutelier#0000
nfts that earn from lottery


[05/23/2022 8:50 PM] koutelier#0000
comet holders earn from lottery


[05/23/2022 8:50 PM] koutelier#0000
then other things , stacking won't solve the investing problem


[05/23/2022 8:50 PM] koutelier#0000
they will make it worst


[05/23/2022 8:51 PM] koutelier#0000
and always remember .comet is here to shill ergo and the projects of ergo. we strongly recommend not to buy it


[05/23/2022 8:51 PM] koutelier#0000
if we manage to add fun utilities then have fun

 Well we recommended people not to buy


[05/24/2022 8:58 AM] koutelier#0000
But if you insist you could buy from refundable ico and refund at any time


[05/24/2022 8:59 AM] Ice Cold Scribbles#0000
how do i get...

 https://thecomettoken.com

This is our website . There you can find refundable ico


[05/24/2022 9:00 AM] koutelier#0000
Or trough ergodex.io


[05/24/2022 9:00 AM] koutelier#0000
In ergodex is cheaper . In our website we refund you if you change your mind in the price you bought

It’s a shitcoin you know that right?


[05/24/2022 9:01 AM] Ice Cold Scribbles#0000
so cheaper to swap... than to do the ico


[05/24/2022 9:02 AM] Ice Cold Scribbles#0000
yes


[05/24/2022 9:02 AM] koutelier#0000
[thread]: Yeap


[05/24/2022 9:02 AM] koutelier#0000
Less cheaper


[05/24/2022 9:02 AM] Ice Cold Scribbles#0000
love my shit tokens....coins


[05/24/2022 9:02 AM] koutelier#0000
Almost half the price .


[05/24/2022 9:02 AM] Ice Cold Scribbles#0000
so swap is the best way to go...


[05/24/2022 9:02 AM] koutelier#0000
[thread]: Me too 🤣


[05/24/2022 9:03 AM] koutelier#0000
[thread]: Well if it dips you will lose . Or if erg pump and comet not you will lose . With refundable ico you can always get back the ergs you invested


[05/24/2022 9:03 AM] koutelier#0000
But if you think comet will moon then ergodex is better


[05/24/2022 9:03 AM] Ice Cold Scribbles#0000
lol, so if i go with the ico..... and in 18 months don't like comet and ergo moons then i get a refund


[05/24/2022 9:03 AM] koutelier#0000
Because you will grab more tokens


[05/24/2022 9:04 AM] koutelier#0000
[thread]: Yeap . You have 3 years to refund


[05/24/2022 9:04 AM] Ice Cold Scribbles#0000
this is farkn gold


[05/24/2022 9:04 AM] Ice Cold Scribbles#0000
i don't know why anyone else hasn't done this before


[05/24/2022 9:04 AM] koutelier#0000
Ico wont be available for ever though . You won’t be able to buy only to refund


[05/24/2022 9:05 AM] Ice Cold Scribbles#0000
[thread]: just ansered my next question


[05/24/2022 9:06 AM] koutelier#0000
Because if comet moons then ico can manipulate the price . Buy low sell high


[05/24/2022 9:06 AM] Ice Cold Scribbles#0000
yes


[05/24/2022 9:06 AM] koutelier#0000
It’s just an opportunity to invest in comet and be safe


[05/24/2022 9:07 AM] koutelier#0000
Also 10 lucky addresses that will buy from ico they  will mint one nft for free from the upcoming 3d collection

When mining ERG, miners will receive COMET proportionally. As long as ERG can be mined, COMET will always be mined.

Winner always takes 90% of the pot

Buharat is the Arabic word for “spices” and is a staple in every Middle Eastern home. Our version is influenced by our Egyptian roots and is a versatile blend that balances earthy, sweet and warm spices perfectly. This is a great blend to use when roasting lamb or beef, grilling chicken, or when making iconic showstoppers like Maqloubeh.
Ingredients: Cumin* , cinnamon powder*, bay leaf*, coriander*, cardamom*, cloves*, cinnamon*, allspice*, nutmeg*

I am really curious to see what will happen with the lottery .


[06/06/2022 1:21 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
I didn’t realize LunaDog rugged. Just found the old chat in my archives. I never checked back after dumping it hard on launch.

The lottery?

I believe it is, burning and buyback to burn more $COMET is the next step


[06/07/2022 6:10 PM] Maarten_V#0000
the more people use anything we make we want to reward degens by burning stuff or buying more $COMET to burn it right after


[06/07/2022 6:11 PM] Maarten_V#0000
like a profitable company would do. Buying back it's own 'shares'

 Using Comet or NFTs for voting is investor governance. (With Paideia)

Ergo Nation ID is one-vote-one-person from the larger ecosystem. 

Depending on your vote, both can make sense.

 I propose asking what should we do with the miners rewards

a) buy comet on ergodex
b) buy comet and burn it

 The voting part is totally not ready yet.

A rudimentary version would be that some Comet address sends an NFT to EN address. The NFT would specify the vote, time limit for participating, and how to vote. For example, send 0.01 erg for option 1. Send 0.02 erg for option 2. This would leave a history on-chain.

We are also eyeing the goat voter. Ergoats built some voting tool and used it already. Not sure if it saves results on-chain though.

 Program the game to take 10 minutes. 

Event lasts 20 minutes. 

No way to play twice. 

The first event did not meet the criteria for a good game. Didn't have the tech skills. Now we have more contributors, so hopefully we can improve for next events.


[06/08/2022 1:58 PM] Maarten_V#0000

(re @Maarten_V : *aaaaaaaaaah so it's meant for something happening right -now-*) 
 
 Yes. The event taking place for all at the same time is the key. 

Not convenient, but otherwise we did not come up with any satisfactory way of doing decentralized verification.

 We found out there is an older project already with good tech employing the same idea.

They just have a token, which seems to work against their ideals (which are similar to EN)

@Twitter claims the number of fake accounts is less than 5%. Is this reliable? @elonmusk doesn't believe it and neither do we.

It’s not a binary (human/fake account) problem. It’s much more complex because it’s almost not possible to detect #fakeaccounts run by click farms.

 The game could be anything that requires continuous attention.

Does not have to be too hard or cool. 

Just robust for different machines, accessible, and engaging. 

For quiz, it would be better to have a pool of questions that get shown randomly for 10 minutes.

 We will think of something with this

(re @Maarten_V : *We will think of something with this*) 
 
 If Comet wants to work on a game, then that would also be pioneering, and very welcome contribution for EN.

The monthly event organizer could do multiaccounts, because the game and verification codes are not surprise to them. 

So we aim to rotate the organizer to ensure decentralization. Could be ecosystem projects, or IDs with high reputation. This way if one organizer goes rogue, they still cant verify the bot accounts next month.

Organizing an event could bring good piblicity to a project. Also, there may be a small financial help in selling NFTs.

We started a collection, where the organizer gets to design, sell and collect royalties from 10 event flyers. Maybe those become worth something if EN gains traction. (So the collection grows 10 NFTs per month)

$COMET Lottery rules!

There will always be a 10% chance of having a winner (regardless of the amount of tickets sold)

Winner always takes 90% of the pot
2.5% goes to comet holders 😎
2.5% gets burned 🔥
4% goes to NFT holders 🤑
1% goes to treasury 

If there is no winner 100% goes to the next round

as someone that actually enjoys videogames I think mobile and cryptogames should die 🤣


[06/15/2022 12:11 AM] AS8818#0000

 it is just a cash grab


[06/15/2022 12:13 AM] AS8818#0000
In the short term, the price will be stimulated to rise.


[06/15/2022 12:13 AM] AS8818#0000

21 billion in 30 years or so

Already 322 million burned by someone so not much in circulation 🔥


[06/15/2022 10:42 PM] musalawal04#0000
21B total supply, currently less than 300M in Circulation and the overall supply will be distributed in 30Years time?


[06/15/2022 10:43 PM] koutelier#0000
yes through mining and soon through staking

[06/15/2022 10:45 PM] koutelier#0000
sir it's a meme token. if you take a look in  our white paper the reason of comet is to shill ergo and the project of ergo


[06/15/2022 10:45 PM] Maarten_V#0000
Building all kinds of stuff to burn stuff with as we are a useless token yet better as Bitcoin cash, RVN and other crap

Mint will be postpone for Monday or Tuesday because wallets and dapps must add the new eip04 so you will be able to see and trade your nfts . 

If you thought we would be on time then the joke is on you .


[06/17/2022 5:30 PM] koutelier#0000
It’s not in our hand from now on . Skyharbor guys probably will add eip04 first so you can trade and see your nfts

We are 16 Dumb-Dumb miners that want COMETs like that!


[06/21/2022 12:53 PM] koutelier#0000
the first project that tells the people to go somewhere else. this is $COMET ladies and gentlemen


[06/21/2022 12:54 PM] koutelier#0000
16 people left?


[06/21/2022 12:56 PM] koutelier#0000
neta has 800 miners ?


[06/21/2022 12:56 PM] koutelier#0000
how much neta they put there ?


[06/21/2022 12:58 PM] JOFLITO#0000
(re @koutelier : *how much neta they put there ?*) 
 
 10 million


[06/21/2022 12:58 PM] JOFLITO#0000
we need to dry them up


[06/21/2022 12:58 PM] JOFLITO#0000
and then come back to ergo


[06/21/2022 12:58 PM] JOFLITO#0000
prepare for dump tho


[06/21/2022 12:58 PM] JOFLITO#0000
neta payments are rolling in


[06/21/2022 12:58 PM] JOFLITO#0000
*neta dump


[06/21/2022 12:59 PM] koutelier#0000

[06/21/2022 12:59 PM] koutelier#0000

[06/21/2022 1:01 PM] koutelier#0000
They can put more though


[06/21/2022 1:02 PM] JOFLITO#0000
(re @koutelier : *They can put more though*) 
 
 yeah


[06/21/2022 1:02 PM] JOFLITO#0000
and rate will increase


[06/21/2022 1:02 PM] JOFLITO#0000
because neta will go lower


[06/21/2022 1:04 PM] Maarten_V#0000
trick is going to buy the bottom wich is probably the moment the pool runs dry


[06/21/2022 1:10 PM] JOFLITO#0000
also there is another trick


[06/21/2022 1:10 PM] JOFLITO#0000
if you move pools, your shares move with you


[06/21/2022 1:11 PM] JOFLITO#0000
so if you tell people to move out of Comet, you get more rewards on the next block 🤣


[06/21/2022 1:11 PM] JOFLITO#0000
(if you stay there)


[06/21/2022 1:11 PM] JOFLITO#0000
it is incentivized pool hoping inside getblok subpools


[06/21/2022 1:11 PM] JOFLITO#0000
you pool is getting over 100% effort, move away


[06/21/2022 1:12 PM] JOFLITO#0000
people have mined in your pool, tell them to move


[06/21/2022 1:12 PM] JOFLITO#0000
interesting game there


[06/21/2022 1:13 PM] JOFLITO#0000
(re @C4lculista : *it is incentivized pool hoping inside getblok subpools*) 
 
 @Arohbe idk if this is intended, but I find it fun


[06/21/2022 1:55 PM] Zzzz#0000
How is that possible ?


[06/21/2022 1:56 PM] Zzzz#0000
Block height < Last block found... Really?

Congrats! It's a great achievement since mobile phones are more accessible than PCs. In the future, they can reboot the #AnalOSOlanA network sooner by reaching discord on these phones. Ah, they can even call each other to accelerate the reboot process.

they are a menace, one cob was chewed by a squirrel. they destroyed a third of the seedling at the beginning, chewing the stem


[07/05/2022 8:46 PM] cardelayno#0000

vinyl fence


[07/05/2022 9:07 PM] cardelayno#0000
half vinyl half treated pine


[07/05/2022 9:08 PM] cardelayno#0000
i just dont have time to sit out there and hunt them. well i do, but its hot outside. trap would be better. i can tolerate them. i use fencing so they dont dig when i go to sow seeds and when the seedlings are small. what i can't tolerate are groundhogs, possum, racoon.


[07/05/2022 9:09 PM] cardelayno#0000
i dont mind sharing, what pisses me off is the digging.


[07/05/2022 9:10 PM] cardelayno#0000
its a good supply of meat though, if i need it.

 There is an issue


[07/14/2022 8:05 PM] koutelier#0000
Forwarded from GetBlok News and Announcements: ⚠️ *ATTENTION MINERS* ⚠️ 

We are working with Ergo developers on a reoccuring issue with our Ergo Nodes.  This issue causes nodes to fall out of sync, which have high probability of causing orphan blocks to be found by any of our subpools.  

Our architecture leverages redundant pairs of nodes for any one region, which reduces the likelyhood of this happening, but if both of those nodes are out of sync, this issue will occur.

While we are still narrowing down this bug, please be certain that ALL MINERS who mined on an orphan block will be rewarded. We are working with Ergo Foundation to ensure all miners affected are taken care of.

This is not the first time this has happened in the history of mining pools at ergo, and therefore many who have been with us for a long time know that when we say you will be rewarded for an issue that is not your fault or bad luck - we mean it.  

As always - thank you for your commitment and patience, pls feel free to reach out in our #🆘-support  channel if needed.

[07/18/2022 10:18 PM] HippiePyro#0000
I used two addresses while mining those, swapped after we found one block. Both addresses got payouts leading me to believe all the blocks got paid at once, not a per block basis.

they told me is better than ubuntu


[07/20/2022 2:14 PM] scotman8888#0000
I used arch which is what Manjaro is supposed to be based on


[07/20/2022 2:15 PM] scotman8888#0000
I'd say just use Ubuntu unless Manjaro actually does something Ubuntu doesn't


[07/20/2022 2:16 PM] scotman8888#0000
I've run a lot of servers with Linux but a desktop is a pain in the butt unless you have a lot of time to learn

ubuntu doesnt have it


[07/20/2022 2:54 PM] scotman8888#0000
I actually just looked into this and I like Manjaro I might give it a try. Ubuntu just had a fatty snafu with a kernel upgrade that killed docker so I can't say it's more stable


[07/20/2022 2:55 PM] scotman8888#0000
I've always wanted to try a rolling release like arch but I found they are a bit unstable


[07/20/2022 2:55 PM] scotman8888#0000
So I've basically used debian only for my servers for decades


[07/20/2022 2:56 PM] scotman8888#0000
Anyway sorry I won't be any help to you but it does seem like the Manjaro community is active so best bet is to jump in there and see if someone can help

[07/22/2022 2:27 PM] JOFLITO#0000
Forwarded from ErgoBridgeBot: <MrStahlfelge> We had a discussion in the general channel yesterday, that's basically what I've said:

For me, I'll focus on the actual functionality and that the wallet app works smooth, that's why I am using system-provided UI in the first place.  The system UIs are provided by the operating systems to get a UI done without spending efforts for building UI elements, but just use them. In my experiences, not using them drives up efforts depending on what is needed a lot. I don't have time to do that. If someone is willing to overhaul the iOS UI and does a PR, I'll gladly review it and merge it (when it works for all situations).

I have a brilliant idea for comet sers and all that is required is forking and mashing some things together


[07/25/2022 5:37 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Eventually when coinflip from night owl is created, combine that with your nft lottery idea. So that holders of the nfts get profit sharing

(re @NoahErgo : *Eventually when coinflip from night owl is created, combine that with your nft lottery idea. So that holders of the nfts get profit sharing*) 
 
 doable


[07/25/2022 5:37 PM] NoahErgo#0000
these kinds of coinflip nft schemes are quite popular on other blockchains like sol


[07/25/2022 5:38 PM] NoahErgo#0000

 1kg each? or 1kg total?


[07/25/2022 10:01 PM] cardelayno#0000
2lbs or ~1kg each was my expectation. I didn't amend the raised beds with compost or fertilize well this year, also a bit of fungal disease. But my aim is a 3 pounder.

cow manure compost is generally very good on it's own. fish is very good but i will not use that it attracts a lot of pests.

COMET SHOULD BE THE FIRST WITH A INTERACTIVE PUZZLE/MINIGAME NFT ahaha I would buy for fun if ERG does not go up.


[07/28/2022 3:12 PM] NickCragg#0000
Or I want refund

(re @NickCragg : *COMET SHOULD BE THE FIRST WITH A INTERACTIVE PUZZLE/MINIGAME NFT ahaha I would buy for fun if ERG does not go up.*) 
 
 wdym sir?


[07/28/2022 3:15 PM] NickCragg#0000
Make a NFT that could be say Comet, amd you feed it lambchops and it shits out another token. Like comet mining tokens but you do not know what the Comet dog will shit out when you feed it comey


[07/28/2022 3:15 PM] NickCragg#0000
Comet*


[07/28/2022 3:16 PM] NickCragg#0000
Or another token. An interactive NFT like I was saying on AMA this morming


[07/28/2022 3:16 PM] NickCragg#0000
They ignored me


[07/28/2022 3:18 PM] NickCragg#0000
Comet dog NFT that when you send it tokens, it sends you back Token of equal value or less or more like a lottery


[07/28/2022 3:19 PM] koutelier#0000
Could work


[07/28/2022 3:19 PM] NickCragg#0000
Dang, I would buy one forsure, I will keep coming up with more interactive NFT ideas aswell


[07/28/2022 3:19 PM] JOFLITO#0000
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣


[07/28/2022 3:19 PM] JOFLITO#0000
we could steal the nft minting script


[07/28/2022 3:20 PM] JOFLITO#0000
so it is legit


[07/28/2022 3:20 PM] koutelier#0000
So you send your nft to a sc with a token and swaps the tokens you send and send you back the same amount of comet tokens or less lol


[07/28/2022 3:20 PM] JOFLITO#0000
(re @koutelier : *So you send your nft to a sc with a token and swaps the tokens you send and send you back the same amount of comet tokens or less lol*) 
 
 sir


[07/28/2022 3:20 PM] JOFLITO#0000
we need to send more to some sirs


[07/28/2022 3:20 PM] koutelier#0000
Yes sir


[07/28/2022 3:21 PM] koutelier#0000
We can do this , you send any amount of tokens then the script swaps them to comet and sends back same , more or less amount of comet token


[07/28/2022 3:22 PM] koutelier#0000
So you send 100 ergopads you get back the same , less or more in comet tokens


[07/28/2022 3:25 PM] JOFLITO#0000
wait


[07/28/2022 3:25 PM] JOFLITO#0000
it is the other way around


[07/28/2022 3:25 PM] JOFLITO#0000
you send comet


[07/28/2022 3:25 PM] JOFLITO#0000
and you get secret tokens


[07/28/2022 3:25 PM] JOFLITO#0000
@NickCragg sir


[07/28/2022 3:25 PM] JOFLITO#0000
maybe you send any token and then get any token back?


[07/28/2022 3:26 PM] NickCragg#0000
Yeah


[07/28/2022 3:26 PM] NickCragg#0000
Any token for any


[07/28/2022 3:26 PM] NickCragg#0000
So you never know and comet devs can get rich off people betteting ergs


[07/28/2022 3:26 PM] koutelier#0000
No no


[07/28/2022 3:26 PM] NickCragg#0000
Jk


[07/28/2022 3:27 PM] koutelier#0000
Any token will be hard


[07/28/2022 3:27 PM] koutelier#0000

[07/28/2022 3:27 PM] koutelier#0000

[07/28/2022 3:27 PM] koutelier#0000

Auto swap them like guapswap does with their mining mechanism


[07/28/2022 3:29 PM] koutelier#0000
They swap ergs for any token in ergodex


[07/28/2022 3:34 PM] Pinnacle94#0000
Ok


[07/28/2022 3:47 PM] koutelier#0000
We could give these utilities to the lottery nfts


[07/28/2022 4:04 PM] NickCragg#0000
Comet Push Puzzle NFT that pays 1 comet on completion and scramble for life. (Up to certain amount in tokenomics)


[07/28/2022 4:07 PM] NickCragg#0000
Comet Ring toss machine NFT that pays comet per completion of all rings


[07/28/2022 4:07 PM] NickCragg#0000
Idk if that would be possible or the push puzzle but innovative

From Day 1 Nautilus wallet was open source. 

The first fork from Comet is coming soon. 

How do I feel about it... 

At least they are playing with the code, learning, and maybe will even improve something. 

That is why it is open source, to begin with.

[08/07/2022 4:01 PM] koutelier#0000
in order to use the mixer you need to run all the time until you receive the funds


[08/07/2022 4:02 PM] koutelier#0000
until the mixing process is done

 description of the ico logic ?


[08/10/2022 1:15 PM] koutelier#0000
basically it's a safe way to invest in a token before it launches . we didn't add any requirement on the smart contract so you can refund for any reason, with few tweaks this smartcontract can be used as an option smart contract or for future idos imo. basically for me it's the safest way to invest in a token.


[08/10/2022 1:16 PM] koutelier#0000

 just the comments on the code, we could make a medium article explaining how it works


[08/10/2022 2:00 PM] JOFLITO#0000
but is just, for every erg, you get 150k comet + 150k refundTicket and viceversa


[08/10/2022 2:00 PM] JOFLITO#0000
so first it checks if you are sending or recieving erg


[08/10/2022 2:00 PM] JOFLITO#0000
and then a set of conditions that check you are not cheating the sell


[08/10/2022 2:01 PM] JOFLITO#0000

Forwarded from ErgoBridgeBot: <koutelier> Comet wallet: 

There is a bug in manifesto file that doesn't allow people to download $COMET wallet from chrome store, also chrome store rejected the version 5 of our wallet because it look alike another app that exist there 🤔  so we need to do some changed in the description of the wallet as well. 

We will push a new update as soon as we fix the burn tab in our wallet.  @capt_nemo welp 


Lottery update: 

$COMET is looking for a ergoscript dev to write our lottery smart contract : 
Bounty 500SigUSD 

ICO update:
We turned off the option for people to buy our ICO so now they can only refund.
Waiting for @JOFLITO to empty the smart contract.
Also we got our refundable ICO contract reviewed from @kushti  😆

No one knows. 😂


[08/11/2022 9:30 PM] Maarten_V#0000
If I have to guess: circulating market cap about 14k dollars


[08/11/2022 9:31 PM] Maarten_V#0000
Depends how many degens bought the refundable ICO now I think of it


[08/11/2022 9:33 PM] Maarten_V#0000
Some person burned about 300.000.000 comet as well… absolutely no clue


[08/11/2022 9:35 PM] Maarten_V#0000
It can be mined already - staked ‘soon’


[08/11/2022 9:38 PM] cardelayno#0000
(re @DistrictUmpire : *hey guys what is the current mc or comet pls?*) 
 
 ~20700000000 * $0.0000107

fully diluted market cap is probably around $220k


[08/11/2022 9:38 PM] cardelayno#0000
circulating, no idea


[08/11/2022 9:39 PM] DistrictUmpire#0000

[08/11/2022 9:44 PM] Maarten_V#0000
250k a erg i think?


[08/11/2022 9:44 PM] cardelayno#0000
there was a refundable ico at 1:250,000 erg. so people who bought into it can always be refunded at that ratio.

I saw on the website that the part of the Ido which was not bought from people will be moved towards staking.
So I wonder if the IDO was sold out and if not which part of the supply was bought out of the 42% for the IDO and then what part of the supply will be use for the staking ? 10% or more it the Ido was not sold out ?

 Let me take a look at the smart contract and I will get back to you . Probably a very small amount because we had already made presales before the ido

(re @koutelier : *so apparently 41,9% or something lol i just checked the contract and it has like 50 ergs inside*) 
 
 So 42% of the supply have been achieved during the ICO so everything was sold


[08/12/2022 3:34 PM] DistrictUmpire#0000
But i don’t understand 50 erg ???


[08/12/2022 3:34 PM] DistrictUmpire#0000
1 erg = 200k tokens at ICO right

Good for new joiners


[08/12/2022 3:36 PM] koutelier#0000
for example we use mining rewards to buy and burn comets .


[08/12/2022 3:36 PM] DistrictUmpire#0000
No vesting for months with people dumping on us


[08/12/2022 3:37 PM] koutelier#0000
so the comets we earn we kinda burn few . staking could have some sort of burn mechanism as well. we don't really know how paideia staking will work so we haven't figure it out yet

 no way of whitelisting a bot?


[08/13/2022 7:49 AM] glasgowm#0000
no sir the api doesn’t report it so it’s not visible to the bridge

Hi to all

Got a foolish idea


[08/13/2022 8:15 AM] Zzzz#0000
We have a subpool where we mine ERG and get COMET as incentive...


[08/13/2022 8:15 AM] Zzzz#0000
Maybe we can rekt this out


[08/13/2022 8:15 AM] koutelier#0000
hmmm


[08/13/2022 8:15 AM] koutelier#0000
explain


[08/13/2022 8:15 AM] Zzzz#0000
I mean, we build a subpool


[08/13/2022 8:16 AM] Zzzz#0000
You get ERG, but instead of getting COMETs, while not burning them

we have 1% fee in this subpool


[08/13/2022 8:18 AM] koutelier#0000
today we are gonna burn the 1% we have received


[08/13/2022 8:19 AM] koutelier#0000
maybe in the future. we can create a subpool and let degens decide if they want to burn comet by mining

`note:` historical address balance relies on ergowatch API but their data has been out of sync last few days. so once that is fixed should be good to go


[08/13/2022 10:40 AM] koutelier#0000
Does ergo watch shows burned amount currently or is it out of sync?

[08/15/2022 5:51 PM] koutelier#0000

[08/15/2022 5:51 PM] curbsideprophet#0000

[08/15/2022 6:09 PM] curbsideprophet#0000
Oh ok I think I get it. So you want to input an address and it spits out count of TX per token ?


[08/15/2022 6:11 PM] koutelier#0000

 We don’t know. We ask smart people to do things for us. Currently I believe at Getblok you get 5000 $COMET each ERG that gets mined

Some guys in a Discord group really like Ergo. I was going to tell them that the Comet ICO is like a call option on Ergo. If Comet is worth less than Erg, you get Erg back, if it’s worth more, sell and get more Erg. Its a genius product.

With the imminent #PoS $ETH merge, I’m curious what all the #miners out there are planning on moving their rigs to.

Top #PoW contenders seem to be $RVN $FLUX $ERG & $ETC. Are you going with one of these or choosing something else?

Let me know 👇🏻

[08/20/2022 10:06 PM] koutelier#0000
instead of erg fees you will pay comet fees


[08/20/2022 10:06 PM] nitevisit#0000
yes, hope miners will accept 1 comet as a transaction fee


[08/20/2022 10:06 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @nitevisit : *yes, hope miners will accept 1 comet as a transaction fee*) 
 
 miners will get ergs lol

The Ethereum merge will fundamentally change crypto, forever

This may be explosive for other #PoW coins as $ETH miners move over their rigs

The strongest contenders to ride this wave seem to be $RVN $FLUX $ERG & $ETC

But which one is brings the most to the table?👇

 Doing layout with css is cancer


[08/21/2022 8:09 PM] Satergo#0000
In JavaFX css is used for styling only. Not layout. It's so much simpler and easier to get right


[08/21/2022 8:10 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *Doing layout with css is cancer*) 
 
 You redesign satergo ? Or ergonodes ?


[08/21/2022 8:10 PM] Satergo#0000
Ergonodes looks weird on landscape mobile


[08/21/2022 8:11 PM] koutelier#0000
Checked out but not in landscape


[08/21/2022 8:11 PM] Satergo#0000

Ergonodes
Ergonodes discovers the size of the Ergo network by finding all nodes participating in it. Useful metrics such as country stats, version usage, and the amount of nodes on a specific date are shown.

Considering the exponential growth of #Ergonauts in social media, do you want to share how long you've been in #ergo and any other detail you want (e.g. how you heard about it).
I'll go first:
May 2021 & heard it first mentioned by @IOHK_Charles 
Now you! Tell me, tell me!

Hey @Ledger -We have a big community waiting on final integration from your end for Ergo. With miners moving post ETH merge, it is crucial this gets sorted out.

Sincerely,

[08/23/2022 2:41 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
Hey Guys, as an effort to get the word out on Ergo, Andy and I discussed a community driven effort promoted by Ergo for an 'Discover Ergo Day'. The goal would be to get many genuine tweets on this day and hopefully start a snowball effect to bring new members onto the community. We do not want to be 'shilly', so the prompt would be something like 'What are your favorite things about Ergo? or 'What brought you to Ergo?'. 

We also want to get a pool of funds for the top 10 tweets. If you guys are willing to put some into the fund please let me know. 

It will be crucial for all projects on Ergo to participate so I ask that you guys get a tweet or a couple ready for the day. 

It will happen September 15th, a few days before the estimated ETH merge. The hashtag we will use is #DiscoverErgo although i suggest to also add $ERG which is the classic one used. There will be more information coming as we need to make everyone in the community aware that it is coming! 

Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions 🙂  @koutelier @C4lculista

Hey $CRYPTO degens, $COMET just burned 6.9M $COMET tokens using the mining fees from $COMET's Subpool in @GetBlok_io . The more you mine , the more we will burn. 🔥🔥🔥 We used @Spectrumlabs_ to buy few $COMET Tokens, kinda reminds me of an old friend 😢

 Initially was going to do this, but it made more sense to add it as an extension instead of running two separate services.

 Do you know what it means?


[08/25/2022 8:44 PM] lano_p#0000
(re @koutelier : *I think comet is the most tipped token*) 
 
 Nope
Hosky has a tip bot on discord that ´rains’ hosky for different timings. 
Rain 20m 10m hosky would mean that everyone that participated in the chat in the last 20 minutes share 10 million hosky

 I mean on ergo side


[08/25/2022 8:45 PM] koutelier#0000
Also most tipped by the community .not from bots


[08/25/2022 8:46 PM] lano_p#0000

 Agreed


[08/25/2022 8:46 PM] lano_p#0000
(re @koutelier : *Also most tipped by the community .not from bots*) 
 
 Tipsa are from the community. The bot is used to do the distribution, like with the one here


[08/25/2022 8:47 PM] koutelier#0000
Yes sir but the tips come from hosky not from the community . We can do the same but we will drive the price down so I don’t like it . We will find another way to distribute our tokens


[08/25/2022 8:47 PM] koutelier#0000

 Not only
The community tip each other as well. I give and receive some from/to other people than Hosky.


[08/25/2022 8:51 PM] koutelier#0000
Hosky devs made it ?


[08/25/2022 8:52 PM] lano_p#0000
(re @koutelier : *Hosky devs made it ?*) 
 
 No it’s Qcpol team that did that. It’s a Quebec base stake pool.
It started as an Ada tip bot but then Hosky asked to be added and so is Minswap


[08/25/2022 8:53 PM] koutelier#0000
Oh nice


[08/25/2022 8:53 PM] koutelier#0000
You can ask lui add that as well 😂😂😂


[08/25/2022 8:55 PM] lano_p#0000
(re @koutelier : *You can ask lui add that as well 😂😂😂*) 
 
 I thought it was for Ergo coins and tokens only.
Transaction costs are too high on Cardano for micro transactions so they have a centralized layer with sub wallets for each Discord participant

Clearly there needs to come with a statement for the #failure  $COMET delivered on #Ergo .

Maybe they're just a bunch of pyromaniacs? Maybe they just like burning sh*t?
Do they do anything except burn their own token? I mean besides the lottery, and the refundable ICO, and the NFTs, and the other things

Wait I know what to do . We will give 3 $COMET nfts to 3 random people that will burn few comet tokens


[09/03/2022 10:36 PM] notmork#0000
we should do governance votes but to pick an option you sent xAmount of comet which gets burned and the option that burns the most, gets passed.

I will copy fake llya contract


[09/03/2022 10:37 PM] koutelier#0000

Someone should make the Comet Carnival Dapp where you can play Minigames to earn and bet comet.

Or do my interactive NFT idea and make Carnival Game NFTs you can buy and play to earn Comet or lose it (which could burn it too)

BUT this proposal by @CometMooning  is actually one of the more interesting ones.

like with most token-based voting mechanisms. the rich have more say, but here at least that advantage diminishes over time.

 Ergopad or NETA?


[09/09/2022 1:37 AM] scotman8888#0000
I guess it's about the same for apy


[09/09/2022 1:38 AM] scotman8888#0000
I've never liked centralized staking unless there is real income being generated.

I think they really regret it. They tried to suppress it but they can't edit the contract. I often wonder how it would have worked if they didn't have any staking returns at all

 The ergopad team, for the high apy. I think Marty added some of the Treasury to suppress it if I remember right. Do you know why they chose such a high apy? I can't remember what the original reasoning was


[09/09/2022 2:36 AM] scotman8888#0000
They probably thought a lot more people would stake, and then the macro bomb went off


[09/09/2022 2:39 AM] cometeer#0000
This is combined with what seems to be a lot of people investing in Ergopad knowing absolutely nothing about Ergo, and only see their token in cents. They see it go from 5 to 6cents get excited while losing 50% against ERG.

well if you are tolkien fan, you know how rich and beautiful his world is, everything you want to know about world building is probably already described, so there is no need to take creative license and make bad fanfic. this amazon thing is just part of the trend for corporation to perverse all things that are good, it's not even about money for them.

He bought a lot of ergopad and is stressed out with the erg/ergopad ratio


[09/15/2022 5:15 AM] scotman8888#0000
Hopefully he didn't buy a lot of exle too


[09/15/2022 5:15 AM] scotman8888#0000
It will all come back, my theory is once all the whales finish buying erg they will start looking into the community

But right now, it's only the mother token that will get love so it's artificial in a way


[09/15/2022 5:18 AM] scotman8888#0000
And the last year erg has brought a lot to the table, more than a lot of chains have done in 5


[09/15/2022 5:18 AM] scotman8888#0000
So there's a lot to attract attention


[09/15/2022 5:20 AM] scotman8888#0000
So that means as soon as the token is available it's sold

[09/17/2022 11:11 PM] scotman8888#0000
I never really got into NETA so the main plan was to have btc wrapped on ergo right


[09/17/2022 11:12 PM] scotman8888#0000
If that's the case it didn't make sense all of the other things that were going on with the token and nfts


[09/17/2022 11:13 PM] scotman8888#0000
So I stayed away and got rekt on ergopad instead

(re @ergomergoadargo : *Can you tell?*) 
 
 It’s like any documentation: read enough and you’ll know if something was written by a toddler or professor . The same with code when reviewing functions, DRY, data schema, etc


[09/18/2022 9:11 AM] curbsideprophetz#0000
(re @ergomergoadargo : *Why wouldn't they just share the finished result rather than the progress to it*) 
 
 Sure but also why work on eNFTs, cNFTs, TosiDrop, claiming lack of dev funds, and now governance voting to sell portion of ERG for sigUSD.

Main question will be if the code was made in a week or they were working on it for more than a year


[09/19/2022 7:07 PM] nirvanush#0000
They didn't develop shit man.. Their core dev said he spent time learning about UTXO model. their other devs never been active in the community. No matter what you do in ergo you can't work without asking questions from other devs. They were busy milking erg from the community with NFT and tokens and waited patiently for Sam to build the bridge. Now any ergo dev/ group of devs can build wrapped btc service. Even if Aneta deliver some product I will not trust my money to a company that doesn't have required dev capabilities in-house and ask for devs outside to do them a favor for some % or tokens. Imagine ErgoDex wouldn't have in-house devs

Forwarded from mhs_sam: :::Regarding AnetaBTC::: 
@Frostyausty sent me a repo today. I will not say anything about it in any ways.

Last time I proposed that AnetaBTC, at least should create a group and share the code with them. This group could be the guys who raised the questions. It's fair enough I assume.

 the ".difficulty" command has been added


[09/20/2022 7:05 PM] JOFLITO#0000
.difficulty


[09/20/2022 7:05 PM] sigmabot#0000
Ergo's difficulty algorithm was designed to reduce the incentive to perform coin-hopping and improve stability of inter-block delays. Coin-hopping is defined as an adversarial miner switching from mining one coin to another in the beginning of an epoch then switching back in the beginning of next epoch when difficulty becomes lower. Difficulty in Ergo is adjusted using the least squares method, which adjusts roughly every two weeks using the past eight epochs to obtain a target block interval of 120 seconds or 2 minutes, on average.

he's saying if you completely shut down btc network and wrap the coin and send it to another network, btc would still be equality valuable as before. just as gold without gold mines.


[10/03/2022 9:10 PM] cometeer#0000
if btc network no longer exist, wrapped btc would have value per market demands. but in and of itself, without a network and just floating as synthetic on other chains, i dont think it have the same characteristic of gold.


[10/03/2022 9:10 PM] JOFLITO#0000
(re @cometeer : *he's saying if you completely shut down btc network and wrap the coin and send it to another network, btc would still be equality valuable as before. just as gold without gold mines.*) 
 
 I see his point


[10/03/2022 9:10 PM] JOFLITO#0000
as in the price of BTC is already set


[10/03/2022 9:11 PM] JOFLITO#0000
since the resources were consumed to create those btc


[10/03/2022 9:11 PM] JOFLITO#0000
also being tradeable in a decentralized network


[10/03/2022 9:11 PM] JOFLITO#0000
if you have both, btc should have the same value


[10/03/2022 9:11 PM] JOFLITO#0000
without the need of being able to change it for "real btc"


[10/03/2022 9:12 PM] cometeer#0000
i dont see it as valuable as before because the trust now is transferred onto the chain it exists on. i would see it as paper btc, or paper gold.


[10/03/2022 9:14 PM] JOFLITO#0000
wrapped btc is definitely paper btc


[10/03/2022 9:14 PM] cometeer#0000
there are a lot of security assumptions with wrapped technology as well, and crosschain. accountability and tracing it back to the source would be difficult task.

[10/03/2022 9:15 PM] JOFLITO#0000
because it is killed in thought experiment


[10/03/2022 9:15 PM] cometeer#0000
gold and silver without mines still have utilities. you can make things with them. their value is also attributed to their distinguishable chemistry, or atomic property. I think you lose that characteristic if you no longer have a mainnet that back your coin and it is just a synthetic token. it would still be valuable, but the value is now mostly provided by the network it's wrapped on. maybe we are seeing this outcome already with gold, as its paper price doesn't seem to have the fair value that reflects the fewer available amount of actual physical gold. similar thing might happen if btc network loses it's importance and most of btc gets wrapped.

Perhaps it could stay valuable by itself, if the data in each coin contains something valuable, but then it would be NFT.


[10/03/2022 9:31 PM] JOFLITO#0000
Isn't the point of btc being tradeable withou a centralized entity?


[10/03/2022 9:31 PM] JOFLITO#0000
if you have that in other chain, why not?

BTC would slowly turn into a NFT

I've been heavy on social media and educating people last few months to help bring in new comers to the ecosystem. I like to think I made a positive impact on bringing more people to Ergo.

Yes I know if you are good at marketing you can turn this into opportunity and gain more interest and argue it will be positive. For me it's hard to talk about the ideals and principals of Ergo while this is unsolved. Wanted to help with the growing effort, but this just made me lost all my motivation.

Need to take a big break and just be a bag holder now.


[10/08/2022 5:03 PM] cometeer#0000
I guess if you are good with the meme and changing people mindset you can take advantage of all this and spin it in a positive way. I'm skeptical but I hope it work out.

fucking ergopad, everytime the snapshot happen it dumps more, except it never goes back up


[10/09/2022 2:16 AM] scotman8888#0000
Ergopad won't pop until the bull market really gets going and people are willing to speculate on new projects


[10/09/2022 2:16 AM] scotman8888#0000
Paideia may be the secret sauce that greases everything though if it works


[10/09/2022 2:17 AM] scotman8888#0000
So, my theory is they get paideia going, bull starts, everyone is in line for ergopad


[10/09/2022 2:17 AM] scotman8888#0000
Lots of projects, lots of demand for ergo, etc but that is definitely not now

(re @DocFil : *Can I get ERG and Comet, don't remember how (followed the info on ergoplatform)*) 
 
 yes by Spectrum. Get some $ERG in your Nautilus browser extension wallet from a CEX (gate, kucoin, huobi), then with the $ERG in your wallet you can buy all ergo tokens on spectrum


[10/10/2022 12:47 PM] DocFil#0000

its a fork of android with improvement in security. there is built in toggle for network access for each app, built in "microG" like functionality, you can install google play services but it run in its own sandbox.

[10/18/2022 9:36 PM] JOFLITO#0000
then sell those comet on spectrum for erg


[10/18/2022 9:36 PM] JOFLITO#0000
and then rebuy on ico


[10/18/2022 9:37 PM] JOFLITO#0000
then resell and rebuy


[10/18/2022 9:37 PM] JOFLITO#0000
etc


[10/18/2022 9:37 PM] JOFLITO#0000
then buy comet on spectrum


[10/18/2022 9:37 PM] JOFLITO#0000
and refund all his tickets


[10/18/2022 9:37 PM] JOFLITO#0000
will he make free money?


[10/18/2022 9:38 PM] koutelier#0000
if the price is lower than spectrum yes


[10/18/2022 9:38 PM] JOFLITO#0000
with those 10 erg he could buy like 17 erg


[10/18/2022 9:38 PM] koutelier#0000
so empty that fucking smart contract  already


[10/18/2022 9:40 PM] lano_p#0000
Refundable ICO is still not back however, right?


[10/18/2022 9:41 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @lano_p : *Refundable ICO is still not back however, right?*) 
 
 the contract is open source


[10/18/2022 9:41 PM] koutelier#0000
the contract address


[10/18/2022 9:41 PM] koutelier#0000
sooo...


[10/18/2022 9:41 PM] koutelier#0000
if you build a tx you can buy comet from the contract


[10/18/2022 9:41 PM] koutelier#0000
until @C4lculista mfer empty the contract


[10/18/2022 9:42 PM] lano_p#0000
Do I just send erg to the contract address? Not a technical person so I’m not sure what else I could do


[10/18/2022 9:42 PM] koutelier#0000
hmm could work? i am not sure


[10/18/2022 9:43 PM] JOFLITO#0000
(re @lano_p : *Do I just send erg to the contract address? Not a technical person so I’m not sure what else I could do*) 
 
 no


[10/18/2022 9:43 PM] JOFLITO#0000
you need to replicate the contract


[10/18/2022 9:43 PM] JOFLITO#0000
and use the boxes


[10/18/2022 9:43 PM] lano_p#0000
(re @C4lculista : *no*) 
 
 Ok thanks


[10/18/2022 9:43 PM] JOFLITO#0000
you need to build the transaction to and from the boxes guarded by the contract


[10/18/2022 9:44 PM] JOFLITO#0000
if you cloned the github


[10/18/2022 9:44 PM] JOFLITO#0000
maybe you can do it locally


[10/18/2022 9:44 PM] lano_p#0000
Or I can lose my precious Erg 😂

 you just need to sync your node but apparently you have more time to explain how things work

[10/18/2022 9:57 PM] JOFLITO#0000

 Tomatoes ?


[11/04/2022 4:45 AM] cometeer#0000
carrot seem to be recommended because of the bright orange color.

 We have a small green house where you can grow vegetables all the season


[11/04/2022 5:18 AM] cometeer#0000
it gets down to negative fahrenheit here, so growing a few small plants indoor is the only choice.


[11/04/2022 5:18 AM] cometeer#0000
i did used my double layers low tunnel one year and certain vegs survive through the winter, but its very limited.


[11/04/2022 5:20 AM] cometeer#0000
if i had insight i would have invested in mining and use the residual heat to grow during winter and heat the house. now i'm rekt.

 You need to transfer that heat directly to the inside of the case without moisture

Just letting you guys know that I'm ok. Apparently there was a taxi explosion close to here, but it's under control.
Security is very tight and the city isn't phased.
Things are normal. Just a lot of ID checks and metal detectors

Thank you for all of your concern

 I think they are also waiting for paideia to do the legwork and then build on that

(re @scotman8888 : *I do feel bad for ergo lend they went live right when the market crashed the first time this year*) 
 
 I feel bad for every crypto project, everything is being hit hard but people only see the ones they are invested in like it's a unique drop


[11/15/2022 1:37 PM] scotman8888#0000
That one is unique, it has the unfortunate situation of the investment round being in bull times and the distribution round during the bear so everyone seems to sell the second they get the tokens


[11/15/2022 1:38 PM] scotman8888#0000
I was broke after ergopad/paideia/comet so I never made it to ergolend


[11/15/2022 1:41 PM] scotman8888#0000
If it does take off though it could be amazing, it's hard to call a bottom but certainly capitulation is in the air


[11/15/2022 1:42 PM] scotman8888#0000
I have a few friends that are dreading the holidays due to family taking their advice and buying crypto


[11/15/2022 1:43 PM] scotman8888#0000

(re @cometeer : *yeah the whole thing*) 
 
 yeah eaz


[11/20/2022 7:45 PM] koutelier#0000
you need some pork ,you just add salt and pepper, you can put it on the oven or grill it (better if you grilled that) you need to take a piece that will have a bit fat


[11/20/2022 7:45 PM] koutelier#0000
you chop this in small pieces


[11/20/2022 7:46 PM] koutelier#0000
then you put the pita on the oven or again you grill it . (you can make pita i guess it's just floor and water  or buy  a package)


[11/20/2022 7:47 PM] koutelier#0000
for the tsatsiki you need. yogurt, garlic ,salt pepper, olive oil , cucumber and some lemon juice


[11/20/2022 7:47 PM] koutelier#0000
then add fried potato's , tomatoes and onions and you are set


[11/20/2022 7:51 PM] cometeer#0000
yeah i can do it, its not hard, just alot of components to put together for one meal, the bread probably take the most time


[11/20/2022 8:03 PM] cometeer#0000
the dipping sauce is amazing, made it with the above combination mix

Development on Cardano has been difficult with alot of funding going into tooling, infrastructure and security. This alongside the uncertainty around development completion has led to the best course of action being halting development of dUSD.

Sorry but I tend to be very skeptical of "Decentralized" wrapped tokens!
How is this decentralized? I found a minimal and high-level explanation of the protocol in the documentation.
I'm asking in good faith, I just don't see how this is decentralized. Here are my questions:

I’ll have to try that. Fancy looking soy sauce.


[11/27/2022 1:59 AM] cometeer#0000
its a thicken soy sauce, not the regular liquid kind, but not very sweet like kecap manis either.

I tend to use coco aminos as soy sauce substitute, it has a slightly sweeter earthy flavor and less salty

also help to add some kind of wine vinegar, but my home made hot sauce is quite acidic already

 I made a sauce today for some pork buns. It was regular soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, bit of honey, and some sesame seeds.


[11/27/2022 3:10 AM] rustinmyeye#0000
Something about sesame and ginger together is amazing.

any specific plans for the DAO?

i wonder if some crosschain colabs can be done, like bridging over hosky and staking the wrapped token in the comet dao for incentives.


[12/08/2022 3:36 AM] cometeer#0000
might be too complicated with the codes. staking for a certain amount of time to receive a one time coupon code for emporas if paid with the same address


[12/08/2022 3:37 AM] cometeer#0000
there would have to be yield farming involved to make it sustainable

Hey #Ergo frens 👋

Occurred to me that a lot of your dApps are already designed for eUTxO architectures!

If you're interested in porting your dApp to Cardano ☎️ me maybe?

New $COMET ATL always right the corner after ATH. Makes it hard to decide, whether you should buy lottery NFTs or just plain $COMET to get a cut of the sweet sweet lottery gains!

(re @cometeer : *possibly best chocolate milkshake i have made*) 
 
 Are you going to share the recipe of just tease us all.  Are we using ice cream here or straight milk / half and half and cocoa powder. 🧋


[12/13/2022 11:40 PM] cometeer#0000
i just used what i have.

50% half/half, 25% dry milk powders, 25% hot water, dark chocolate bar, sugar. and stir in a pot up to a low-medium temperature where all the chocolate melts and it create a lot of bubbles. then use a electric coffee whisk


[12/13/2022 11:42 PM] cometeer#0000
trick is not to over cook (over pasteurized) the milk

Rektness is the main reasons to buy, Ser. You should know that by now. Also, there's also the option not to buy at all. Unless you want lottery tickets, then you have to buy some $COMET.

just before  the bear market i said i was going to drop $500 on comet, when it was around 1:250,000. or 21million comet.

then i dumped it into ergopad. now ergopad is 20% of the original value I bought it for.


[12/16/2022 6:42 AM] cometeer#0000
how much ergopad emission came out of getblok, i wonder if that factor into the downward trend. (along with the ridiculous apy)

16% 🤣

 Only 127k Ergopad, unlikely to drop price by that much given it was emitted over several months.

Comet


[12/16/2022 7:09 AM] koutelier#0000
(re @K : *So I get ERG or COMET?*) 
 
 $COMET sir . You can dump after for ergs lol


[12/16/2022 7:10 AM] koutelier#0000
Now I am thinking I should add in the FE how much the distribution address has and how much will go to nft holders and token holders . How much will get burn etc


[12/16/2022 7:10 AM] K#0000
My Nautilus wallet is so buggy it won't even let me swap my ERG for more COMET. Capt Nemo preventing me from getting rekt 😞

How many tokens there ?


[12/16/2022 7:17 AM] K#0000
Tokens aren't much of an issue, I mostly have Comet and one or two nfts. But I think I have 10k+ utxos with 0.001 ERG inside them.


[12/16/2022 7:17 AM] K#0000
Old getblok fee system has my wallet rekt now too


[12/16/2022 7:17 AM] cometeer#0000
why cant you just consolidate


[12/16/2022 7:18 AM] K#0000
Because sending anything above 0.5 ERG crashes Nautilus and SAFEW 😁. And SAFEW dev mode fails when I try to consolidate it manually.

Only one promies have been broken. That people would be rekt by gurantee. 

That being said,$COMET brings more utility in play, than most 99 out of a 100 chain. And there's no wack promises of "store of value" utility. The memes are pretty good too...

you should clean up the UI, its too much clutter in one place


[12/16/2022 11:48 PM] MGpai#0000
the main stat should be the amount Comet in the pool

Comet holders and nft holders will take everything is in the pool after the contract  choose  a winner


[12/17/2022 2:34 PM] koutelier#0000
Also this time there was no winner I believe but the pool shows zero because of a bug

Ergo should market itself as a gambling and lottery platform. Just appealing to human nature.

And Flux as a porn platform, you have to pay flux to access exclusive contents.

 True. Most people won't even try then. Hmm I guess just give all the Comet to the AI. They win, just let them take over everyrhing

When you buy a ticket does it get sent to wallet?

yes

@koutelier should there be a cut off time before the draw


[12/20/2022 6:10 AM] yeahokai#0000
Says there is like 20min


[12/20/2022 6:10 AM] cometeer#0000

[12/20/2022 6:16 AM] koutelier#0000
(re @cometeer : *@koutelier should there be a cut off time before the draw*) 
 
 It is handling in the backend I believe


[12/20/2022 6:16 AM] cometeer#0000
i mean what is the implication if you implement a rule that you cant by more tickets one hour before the draw


[12/20/2022 6:16 AM] koutelier#0000
I can disable the buttons on the frontend 30 sec before the time runs out if you want


[12/20/2022 6:17 AM] MGpai#0000
buy a few mins before cut off (block confirmation)


[12/20/2022 6:17 AM] cometeer#0000
(re @koutelier : *I can disable the buttons on the frontend 30 sec before the time runs out if you want*) 
 
 it would have to be on smart contract level


[12/20/2022 6:18 AM] koutelier#0000
Why one hour ?


[12/20/2022 6:19 AM] MGpai#0000
just reduce the time shown on frontend by 5 or 10 min


[12/20/2022 6:19 AM] MGpai#0000
smart contracts should be simple as they can


[12/20/2022 6:21 AM] cometeer#0000
(re @koutelier : *Why one hour ?*) 
 
 just arbitrary number, perhaps a deadline create incentive


[12/20/2022 6:21 AM] cometeer#0000
at the sametime it might be gamed

[12/20/2022 7:00 AM] IIAB#0000
The kind where the pool keeps growing, incentivicing new actors to buy tickets making the pool grow even bigger. This way benefiting the  Comet NFTs holder as well as Comet holders, and eventually the one who get the big winning and gonna dumpn it all on us, making Comet tank to the ground. And then we're all rekt for yolo'ing in to a meme Token. Promise forfilled!

@koutelier will you ever decrease price of lottlery ticket with increasing value of Comet ? if yes, will it go back to todays price after winner dump it all ? 🤔


[12/20/2022 7:34 AM] koutelier#0000
(re  : *<outsider dogue> @koutelier will you ever decrease price of lottlery ticket with increasing value of Comet ? if yes, will it go back to todays price after winner dump it all ? 🤔*) 
 
 We need to consider that but since there isn’t a major pump I don’t believe this is necessary at the moment.


[12/20/2022 7:35 AM] koutelier#0000
Changing the price is really easy to do after the lottery ends and we can change it if needed . 250K comet is around 2 ergs atm so not expansive


[12/20/2022 7:36 AM] koutelier#0000
If erg moons or comet moons we can reduce to something like 3-5 dollars per ticket . I think this is pretty reasonable .


[12/20/2022 8:04 AM] outsider dogue#0000
Cool, thats the answear


[12/20/2022 8:49 AM] koutelier#0000
As an OG suggested and I find that  reasonable we should put the 1% of the treasury fund we have on the lottery to provide liquidity


[12/20/2022 8:49 AM] koutelier#0000
That will mean though we will have to swap half of it

[12/20/2022 10:19 AM] koutelier#0000
But since we don’t have that kind of money yet. To buy stock we started with merch and dropship . That has the drawback that the prices are not so affordable for the average consumer


[12/20/2022 10:20 AM] koutelier#0000
But we are working on making some deals and also figuring out legal stuff about how to pay vendors . Also utilize a system that vendors will have the ability to choose between fiat or crypto payments

Whales be whaling homie. We can predict what they'll do, its like trying to predict the weather.    A lot of qualified guesses that it will rain cats and dildos tomorrow, but when you get out of bed, the sun is shining brighter than ever. 

Point being, dont obsess with the charts, with Comet you gonna get rekt no matter what.

[12/21/2022 7:52 PM] Arohbe#0000
@koutelier had an idea.  Comet should have different tiers of lotto tickets by price. Like $1 , $5, $10 per ticket.  Each price tier has its own prize pool and the odds can change depending on the value of the ticket.


[12/21/2022 7:55 PM] koutelier#0000
interesting idea. We could do 10k $COMET for 3% possibility of winning 100k for 6% and 250k for the rich and risky people with 10% luck lol or smth like that


[12/21/2022 8:07 PM] Arohbe#0000
I like it.  If no winner the smaller pools will build up faster = bigger pot to share.


[12/21/2022 8:07 PM] Arohbe#0000
Maybe even winner splits. Randomly draw two addresses and they share the pot.


[12/21/2022 8:08 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @Arohbe : *Maybe even winner splits. Randomly draw two addresses and they share the pot.*) 
 
 let's see what others think.


[12/21/2022 8:52 PM] IIAB#0000
Like this spllit. Also like the idea of smaller pots building up. Think it would be a good idea to keep up engagement in the community. 250.000 $COMET might scare of some people, that would otherwise be willing to try their luck. Small pool building quickly might further the incentive.

I almost decided not to buy tickets to avoid having to do each one manually + fees, having in mind that it prob takes just a few hours to add a selectable option I think you should add it to your top 1 priority, "low effort high possible reward"

 You won’t avoid fees since all tx are send in different boxes . So each time you pay 250K comet plus 0.003 ergs for fees

We can do changes but after this lottery ends.

By end I mean choose a winner


[12/23/2022 5:15 AM] koutelier#0000
We are thinking of two solutions . First adding a limitation . So after let’s say 6 versions or 100M comet the lottery has to choose for a winner . The other is to add multiple winners


[12/23/2022 5:15 AM] koutelier#0000
We can do both tbh. Whatever works best

Forwarded from Arohbe: Hey everyone 👋 We are going to start to logo contest with a smaller group. Figured the best artists are the main Ergonauts anyways. 

Kirat Cheese and I are donating 50 ERG as the reward and @koutelier offered to donate 5 comet lotto tickets.  We’re also donating a $25 Emporas Gift Card.  

We’re not sure exactly what we want the logo to look like but we were thinking something tied to Mining, Decentralization,  and Transparency.  We also want it to tie into Lithos as the words origin but not too Greek 

Litho- a combining form meaning “stone”.  

We will let the contest run for a week or two (with the holidays) and then put the logos up for vote as guidance for our decision.  Once we have a logo designed we can begin working on over all design and branding.  We want to get all of that out of the way before opening to the public. 

Let us know of you have any questions. Thanks.

That one guy will win it all


[12/23/2022 9:14 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @ergflip : *And if just one buy and there is a winner*) 
 
 No. 10% of being a winner


[12/23/2022 9:14 PM] koutelier#0000
There is 10% possibility the contract will draw for a winner . So it choose one ticket each time and then with 10% luck chooses if this wins or not


[12/23/2022 9:14 PM] ergflip#0000
Yes, there is 10% of having a winner


[12/23/2022 9:15 PM] ergflip#0000
But if there is only one person who bought a ticket


[12/23/2022 9:15 PM] ergflip#0000
He will win 100%


[12/23/2022 9:15 PM] ergflip#0000
If there is a winner.

(re @koutelier : *There is 10% possibility the contract will draw for a winner . So it choose one ticket each time and then with 10% luck chooses if this wins or not*) 
 
 Correct, and if there is just one ticket bought, there is a 10% he gets it all


[12/23/2022 9:17 PM] koutelier#0000
there is always one winner at the current form of the lottery


[12/23/2022 9:17 PM] koutelier#0000
one winner takes 90%


[12/23/2022 9:17 PM] koutelier#0000

Also, is the lotto okay? I know that other person said they never got their ticket for the most recent one, and mine isn't showing either, but the comet is def missing from my wallet

 Fyi the dev is updating the off chain bot so everyone could run it and we have no power of stopping the lottery. So after the update your tickets will arrive, and the lottery will be even more decentralized

10months late but anyway, see comet soon on cardano

[12/26/2022 5:57 PM] MGpai#0000
fixed now


[12/26/2022 5:58 PM] MGpai#0000
we had someone forcefully process transactions with the current deployed offchain-bot active on comet's side


[12/26/2022 5:58 PM] MGpai#0000
since the first version wasn't intended for other to run it caused bugs


[12/26/2022 5:59 PM] MGpai#0000
as mentioned earlier the new iteration of the bot which is almost complete will allow for scenarios like this


[12/26/2022 6:21 PM] koutelier#0000
Thank you sir


[12/26/2022 6:22 PM] koutelier#0000

 That comes with some questions . Where the tokens come from? For sure you can send comet but how much and for how long ? What are the benefits if I am the creator and I send tokens all the time ?

Could be redone with a good ticket price


[12/29/2022 5:17 AM] PhilJohnsonFull#0000
If we sell 15 erg per ticket


[12/29/2022 5:18 AM] PhilJohnsonFull#0000
We can buy a decent bit of tokens. But good luck it's just an idea I don't code


[12/29/2022 5:20 AM] PhilJohnsonFull#0000
15 erg ticket goes towards 10 for tokens for next round and 3 to ergo foundation treasury and we hit the hackathon also 2 for nft holders (3000 more)

 comet investment advice is don't buy, so going against that advice is detrimental  also total supply is 21 billion, so you haven't seen the real rug yet

Kout' doing a slow rug on himself as we speak. He'll have nothing left to rug us with by that time! 

Anyways, who's gonna get themselves a new years ticket for that sweet arse 47.000.000 lottery pool?  I think ill throw at least another 250k into that black hole of rektness

I think something is not right with the lottery design, after gambling many times our comet, now that we know how it works why would we gamble them at the first round


[12/29/2022 9:39 PM] ergflip#0000
Why would anyone start buying lottery tickets when the pool is small, when you can wait for x round where you are happy with the amount there is collected


[12/29/2022 9:53 PM] koutelier#0000
This is irrelevant the lottery doesn’t wait for the pool to get bigger


[12/29/2022 9:54 PM] koutelier#0000
The first run had just 6 million


[12/29/2022 9:54 PM] koutelier#0000
But we are making 3 more lotteries with different price and possibilities to increase the interest and make it affordable for brokeboiz


[12/29/2022 9:56 PM] MGpai#0000
you may have a possibility of winning and less people in lotto means you have a higher chance to win


[12/29/2022 9:56 PM] MGpai#0000
classic game theory


[12/29/2022 10:01 PM] ergflip#0000
(re  : *<MGpai> you may have a possibility of winning and less people in lotto means you have a higher chance to win*) 
 
 There is a MUCH higher chance of not winning, you are risking the same 10% that maintains stable always for a hypothetical less reward


[12/29/2022 10:02 PM] ergflip#0000
There are 2 conditions that have to happen for you to win, if one of them is stable while the possible reward is much less...


[12/29/2022 10:03 PM] ergflip#0000
Both conditions would have to scale proportionally with reward for it to be equally rewarding in case of winning


[12/29/2022 10:04 PM] ergflip#0000
Idk I see it common sense, I dont see myself buying tickets at first round while I could save those for a hypothetical next round with bigger pool


[12/29/2022 10:14 PM] koutelier#0000
You just think like this because of the small traction that is duo to bear marker or the high ticket price atm


[12/29/2022 10:14 PM] koutelier#0000
Having 10% possibility on winning in a lottery is extremely high and unlikely to see somewhere else


[12/29/2022 10:15 PM] koutelier#0000
If the community was bigger you wouldn’t be in that dilemma since naturally the pool would be big from first run .


[12/29/2022 10:19 PM] ergflip#0000
(re @koutelier : *You just think like this because of the small traction that is duo to bear marker or the high ticket price atm*) 
 
 Small traction makes my statement more noticeable, if there were millions of user playing it would be less noticeable but still a fact


[12/29/2022 10:25 PM] koutelier#0000
I don’t get the fact?


[12/29/2022 10:25 PM] koutelier#0000
The fact is you have low % of winning ?

 So smaller pool bigger % of winning , larger pool smaller ^?


[12/29/2022 10:47 PM] ergflip#0000
Two conditions need to be met to win x reward, if reward is 2x in the second round, for it to be as worth attempting to win as in the first round chances of winning in the first round need to be 2x the second one


[12/29/2022 10:49 PM] ergflip#0000
Well idk how to say it myself fuck


[12/29/2022 10:51 PM] ergflip#0000
The simplest way to see it honestly is:

Imagine you are the ONLY person playing in first round, you get lucky and the 10% happens, you have won you were quite lucky congrats, yet you receive the same amount you gambled (well, less due to fees), as you were the only one playing


[12/29/2022 10:52 PM] ergflip#0000
That also scales to situations with more plays than just yours, although the more plays the less obvious it is at first sight


[12/29/2022 10:53 PM] ergflip#0000
Which means, why would anyone want to spend their ergs/comet for first rounds, knowing the Risk/reward is not as beneficial as it could be later on


[12/29/2022 10:53 PM] ergflip#0000

NFTs could be sold to increase score multipliers on games to "cheat" a bit. Not too much so it's not pay to win, but enough that regular players have to try harder.


The NFTs could be playable characters or something as well so it's a multiplier bonus plus cosmetic


[12/30/2022 1:23 AM] PhilJohnsonFull#0000
A comet platformer game like Mario would be cool. I love to see the platformer model expanded and those types of indie games do well and have speed run communities. 

Which an endless platformer would be hard but what if it had an AI to generate the world as you moved or right when you hit play so the game and platform is still possible to complete but different each time.

Same with space invaders. Different ships and enemy movement done by a good AI


[12/30/2022 1:23 AM] PhilJohnsonFull#0000
All the games would just need an infinite ai generated world and some sort of enemies and objective

So you would need to make a bot for generating different types of worlds and I think that would be so cool to have one bot for different types of infinite play time games could run on

I like the idea, I'm too lazy to install an emulator


[12/30/2022 1:33 AM] PhilJohnsonFull#0000
(re @gg : *I like the idea, I'm too lazy to install an emulator*) 
 
 Yeah, and no highscore or possible rewards. Maybe even a comet arcade game pass subscription


[12/30/2022 5:09 AM] koutelier#0000
(re @ergflip : *Which means, why would anyone want to spend their ergs/comet for first rounds, knowing the Risk/reward is not as beneficial as it could be later on*) 
 
 This is why it’s called gambling sir. The possibilities of winning doesn’t make sense why to bet on first place . Also in each run you have the same possibility to win so nothing changes . You might get lucky you might not


[12/30/2022 5:13 AM] koutelier#0000
Great ideas but unfortunately comet doesn’t have the treasury to do something like that .


[12/30/2022 5:13 AM] PhilJohnsonFull#0000
All g. I will stop brainstorming. Maybe ergo games make something like that


[12/30/2022 5:15 AM] koutelier#0000

 Tmk gambling promoted/conducted by any corporate entity or organization (ergo games?!) Is regulated resp. prohibited in most countries. 

On the other hand, decentralized smart contract use is a true alternative and cannot be restricted if done right.

So I see a case for community lottery, even stronger than to refer it to pros

The event that initiated in Spring 2020 and the turbulence two years that follows was the most difficult challenges of my life so far and I'm sure for most people. There was a mayor shift in consciousness for many, in varying ways, bad and good. Don't mean to be new agey, but I believe  2023 will be a year of spiritual awakening for many, for those who endured last two years and kept their humanity and willingness to question. I didn't have huge success in worldly gains, but I achieved in other ways. 2023 is a rebuilding year for me, but also of learning and serving.

if Rosen bridge and cross chain works, 10,000 new ada users speculating on ergo tokens would make a bigger difference, provided there is any exposure

[01/07/2023 7:13 PM] srdcftvgyhbjnkml#0000
the only safe time to buy these ergopad tokens are when their staker and seed vesting period are complete


[01/07/2023 7:13 PM] srdcftvgyhbjnkml#0000
no wonder comet doesn't suffer the same fate as they did


[01/07/2023 7:42 PM] koutelier#0000
I think the the 3 new lotteries we will preparing we won’t see any more downfall


[01/07/2023 7:43 PM] srdcftvgyhbjnkml#0000
what about a chance to win nft?

The dev is really busy I don’t  believe this is possible atm


[01/07/2023 7:44 PM] koutelier#0000
We also want to list more token options. So you can buy ticket with comet ergopad or any other token . All go to same pool


[01/07/2023 7:45 PM] srdcftvgyhbjnkml#0000
how will those token be used

 Wdym?


[01/07/2023 7:45 PM] srdcftvgyhbjnkml#0000
if they get market sell back to comet then it makes sense, otherwise it seem to decrease demand for comet


[01/07/2023 7:47 PM] koutelier#0000
Well the treasury can be used to swap and then provide liquidity to comet


[01/07/2023 7:47 PM] koutelier#0000
For other tokens


[01/07/2023 7:47 PM] koutelier#0000
Or even maybe for comet


[01/07/2023 7:47 PM] srdcftvgyhbjnkml#0000

[01/07/2023 7:48 PM] koutelier#0000
A good option would be to swap and provide liquidity tbh but I really don’t know , I i would prefer the community choose


[01/07/2023 7:48 PM] koutelier#0000
Also this month we have to lock and start releasing the founder tokens

what if we used comet lottery to distribute more comet.

For example we buy 10 tickets for each lottery each time the lottery runs


[01/09/2023 9:26 PM] koutelier#0000
2.5m comet for the big one, 1.25m for the medium and 100k for the small one


[01/09/2023 9:28 PM] koutelier#0000
evetime there is a winner a portion will be going to holders,nft holders and will get burned

when it asks for seed phrases just insert the 24 of what i want (granted it's part of the seed dictionary)

How a Seed Phrase is Created
A seed phrase is an ordered set of 12-24 words that is generated by your wallet and stores all the information that can be used to recover your wallet. For the most part, seed phrases follow Bitcoin Improvement Proposal: 39 (BIP 39). BIP 39 standard describes the process in how a mnemonic phrase (a group of easy to rem

Derivation path matters

(re @notmork : *Derivation path matters*) 
 
 ahh nice TIL thanks for clarifying my n00b knowledge 🙏


[01/09/2023 10:29 PM] notmork#0000
(re @notmork : *Derivation path matters*) 
 
 This is important if you want to restore using your seedphrase into a different wallet (ie the wallet application needs to support the same der. path as  the one used to create the mnemonic initially)

The checksum is in place to ensure it’s a valid hash.

That’s just my understanding and it’s probably flawed in details.. but basically my point is this: DONT JUST CHOOSE RANDOM WORDS.


[01/09/2023 10:42 PM] Cometeer#0000
just have to keep in mind the default path ergo uses


[01/09/2023 10:43 PM] Cometeer#0000
only time it was a problem was when Magnum wallet stopped working and people had to transition to yoroi


[01/09/2023 10:48 PM] Cometeer#0000

How to utilize dice to generate a seed phrase.
Using dice to generate a BIP39 seed phrase is one way to establish a very high level of confidence in the randomness and initial security of seed phrases - especially compared to the default wallet approach.

Good choice, I declare myself as the official CEO of $COMET.

Also in a few weeks I am likely going on a prolonged AWOL, like Jose.

Also no one can take my place while I'm gone.

Mfers both me and Jennie will give all of our COMET tokens to the next comet owners except for a 25% of them that will be unlocked monthly, vote for the unlocking to last 12 months or 18.


[02/05/2023 1:35 AM] dann#0000
No dumping, just an unlocking that was supposed to be done after ergodex listing according to our whitepaper, my tokens will be in a public wallet address, I just dont want Koutelier the degen mfer to hold them 😀

@koutelier I figured out how to make the tastiest pita/tortilla.

Instead of using regular water for the flour, use very salty chicken broth + hot sauce.

Wow I just got a bunch of airdrop from Walrus Dao.

Enough to afford rice and beans to eat for a week. Had to fast for two days so far due to no food.


[02/21/2023 2:57 PM] koutelier#0000
Yo degens , we are thinking of giving rewards to gambit players so we approach some flux dudes. How do you feel about that? I believe we will bring more people to ecosystem but also to $COMET . Shoot your thoughts/ideas


[02/21/2023 2:58 PM] cometeer#0000
probably have to prove you use their zelcore wallet somehow


[02/21/2023 2:59 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @cometeer : *probably have to prove you use their zelcore wallet somehow*) 
 
 No need I believe we just reward users with comet and they will come?


[02/21/2023 2:59 PM] koutelier#0000
What you think would be a fine amount to avoid big dumps ? I was thinking a small amount of comet in each tx in that way txs will be increased hopefully . This is good for ergo in general as we appear more active


[02/21/2023 3:03 PM] cometeer#0000
enough to participate in regular lottery

[02/21/2023 9:23 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @cometeer : *enough to participate in regular lottery*) 
 
 What about 10k comet for each tx until 50m comet is distributed ?


[02/21/2023 9:23 PM] koutelier#0000
10k comet is the cheapest lottery ticket


[02/21/2023 9:25 PM] cometeer#0000
depends on the length of distribution but seems reasonable


[02/21/2023 9:25 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @cometeer : *depends on the length of distribution but seems reasonable*) 
 
 What do you mean the length?


[02/21/2023 9:25 PM] cometeer#0000
span of time


[02/21/2023 9:26 PM] koutelier#0000
Maybe randomly distribute up to max 5 million daily ?


[02/21/2023 9:38 PM] Grand_Gambit#0000
Sounds good to me


[02/21/2023 9:40 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @Grand_Gambit : *Sounds good to me*) 
 
 Can you put a limit , and randomly reward users ?


[02/21/2023 9:56 PM] Grand_Gambit#0000
(re @koutelier : *Can you put a limit , and randomly reward users ?*) 
 
 Yes, some random winners?


[02/21/2023 9:56 PM] Grand_Gambit#0000
Like, u win and there is a 50% chance u get 10k comet


[02/21/2023 9:57 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @Grand_Gambit : *Like, u win and there is a 50% chance u get 10k comet*) 
 
 Better to have 50% chance of winning comet either you win the bet or not


[02/21/2023 9:57 PM] koutelier#0000
In that way you can market it like even if you lose you can win


[02/21/2023 9:58 PM] koutelier#0000
Random tx will get comet regardless the bet outcome. Up to 5 million daily.


[02/21/2023 9:58 PM] Grand_Gambit#0000
(re @koutelier : *Better to have 50% chance of winning comet either you win the bet or not*) 
 
 Makes sense


[02/21/2023 9:59 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @Grand_Gambit : *Makes sense*) 
 
 Ok go on . Let me know when everything is done so we transfer comet to your account


[02/21/2023 10:00 PM] koutelier#0000
I also need to transfer founder tokens to daniumy and create a multisig wallet for the rest comet . Who would like to hold comet keys together with me and daniumy ? @cometeer @scotman8888 @notmork or anyone

 The Cardano tip bot has a rain function. You can rain x amount of Hosky for all users that were in the chat in the last y hours.
Some people tip it back or rain it back and others cash it in. This creates activities in the chat and some use for the token.
Might be something to look into here as well.

[02/23/2023 10:16 AM] koutelier#0000
Yo I think we should make this a thing. Promote and support ergo projects with small rewards


[02/23/2023 10:17 AM] koutelier#0000
I believe is good for ergo and comet ☄️

Help small projects promote it selfs by giving away tokens in a safe way


[02/23/2023 11:40 AM] koutelier#0000
This will help ergo, comet and small projects


[02/23/2023 12:02 PM] vmelev#0000
(re @koutelier : *This will help ergo, comet and small projects*)

[02/23/2023 12:25 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @vmelev : *Which part of the technomics pie chart will you get the comet for this support?*) 
 
 I was thinking just shill projects that don’t have a token


[02/23/2023 12:25 PM] koutelier#0000
Like gambit or other projects


[02/23/2023 12:25 PM] koutelier#0000
That don’t have the funds


[02/23/2023 12:33 PM] Grand_Gambit#0000

V2 should arrive in March

We're also creating an airdrop option for all tokens in the Ergo ecosystem.

i have an idea on how to distribute more tokens and also how to attract more people to ergo & $COMET


[03/24/2023 5:46 PM] ratchpikor#0000
(re @koutelier : *i have an idea on how to distribute more tokens and also how to attract more people to ergo & $COMET*) 
 
 Explain


[03/24/2023 5:47 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @ratchpikor : *Explain*) 
 
 so we have $COMET lottery nfts that get rewards from the lottery once there is a winner


[03/24/2023 5:48 PM] koutelier#0000
we could also make them stakeble and put a certain amount of $COMET tokens to a smartcontract


[03/24/2023 5:49 PM] koutelier#0000
but if we give $COMET tokens this will bring the price down since most will swap for erg


[03/24/2023 5:49 PM] koutelier#0000
we could make it in a way that they either choose to get $COMET tokens or burn the rewards ? lol


[03/24/2023 5:53 PM] ratchpikor#0000
Yeah it reminds me about some BSC tokens, about 90% of the lottery is usually burned and the rest redistributed to the winners


[03/24/2023 5:53 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @ratchpikor : *Yeah it reminds me about some BSC tokens, about 90% of the lottery is usually burned and the rest redistributed to the winners*) 
 
 we have some kind of lottery but i believe we need to distribute more tokens


[03/24/2023 5:55 PM] ratchpikor#0000
Oh sure, you have to calculate the right APR


[03/24/2023 5:56 PM] ratchpikor#0000
The point is to incentivize the user not to convert the profits of the staking pool into ergo


[03/24/2023 5:56 PM] koutelier#0000
yes


[03/24/2023 5:58 PM] ratchpikor#0000
An NFT gift over a certain period of automatic restaking or for any lottery partecipatios could be an idea

This is a story of Samuil. For the past 20 years, Samuil has chosen to live far away from civilization, together with bears and wolves, in one of the harshest environments on Earth. 

The second video of Samuil's story: https://youtu.be/Y16vR6x6X9w

Summary of the video:
- Samuil has lived alone in the forest of Siberia for the past 20 years 
- Every morning, he starts his day by listening to the news on his radio 
- To keep his home warm during the harsh Yakutian winters, he must constantly heat the house by collecting wood from the forest 
- Samuil only eats once or twice a day, and his only source of meat is through setting traps for hares 
- If food supplies run low, he must make the long 5-hour walk to the village 
- The freezing process purifies the water, eliminating any impurities present before it was frozen 
- Samuil doesn't need a refrigerator to keep his food fresh -

Forwarded from ErgoBridgeBot: <mhs_sam> Late update for Rosen Bridge:
- Rosen team is on vacation this week so no dev progress.
- Public test is ongoing and the bridge is working as expected.
- We have two known issues with sigma-rust that are already fixed and pending stable-release by greethat. No other issues during the test period.
- Some UI fixes has been done.
- Assets and Transaction tabs are enabled.

- Next week we will add $Comet to the bridge and it will be open for everyone to test.

By now I have done a few round trips between Cardano and Ergo using @RosenBridge_erg and I have to say the UX is pretty fantastic

Bridging isn't even that slow, a few hours and tokens arrive

Soon we will have public test using @CometMooning and everyone can try it out!

Forwarded from ErgoBridgeBot: <mhs_sam> 🌉 Rosen bridge:

🧪 Public Beta (test) Launch:
- still ongoing in semi-public mode without any issue.
- going to add Comet and probably Hosky tokens to start the full public test
- dealt with cardano token registry and submitted test wrapped Erg token, so the cardano wallets will be able to correctly show the decimals


🛡️ @rosen-bridge/ts-guard-service
Refactor is in progress. There was some problems with jest. Therefore we migrated test suite to vitest, which also have problems, but easier to solve.
Currently, EventProcessor module of guard is under refactor.
In refactor process, some updates may needed in other projects, specially in @rosen-chains, which for now, @rosen-chains/abstract-chain and @rosen-chains/ergo are updating according to needs.

🔎  @rosen-bridge/scanner
Improve memory usage of WebSocketScanners by setting an upper bound for queue. This way when the queue reaches an upper bound, scanner will stop and after processing queue boxes, It'll start again.

⛓️ @rosen-chains 
Started implementing Cardano chain according to abstract classes, tests will be added simultaneously.

        If there wasn't someone to remind me every day that I will be ruined, I would also be happy 😁😅


[04/20/2023 6:46 PM] IIAB#0000
So, still waiting on getting rekt by COMET. Got rekt by ergopad and the IDOs i bought into as well... Selling pressure is way to high on IDO'ed tokens as long as they are locked in vesting contracts. One would probably have better chance to make profit if you wait to buy right up until til the vesting runs out. But hey, whats the fun in that...


[04/20/2023 6:49 PM] ratchpikor#0000
Ironic but true, Comet and Erdoge are my best holds so far, even with Erdoge, with a little trading I could have made over 100%


[04/20/2023 6:52 PM] IIAB#0000
Not bad at all! I wouldn't even know where to get ahold of ergdoge these days,  is even still active?


[04/20/2023 6:56 PM] ratchpikor#0000
Well in crypto there isn't an on/off button, imho it is just the general market sentiment which grave especially on the lower mcaps


[04/20/2023 7:01 PM] IIAB#0000

🧪 Public Beta Launch
We are going to launch the beta version of Rosen Bridge for all of the users from now!
it's available at: https://beta.rosen.tech
Currently we support Erg and Comet on Ergo and Ada and Hosky on Cardano.

🚀 @rosen-clients/*
Finished the implementation of all three client packages and published them to npm registry. The packages are all available publicly:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rosen-clients/ergo-node
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rosen-clients/ergo-explorer
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rosen-clients/cardano-koios
We encountered some issues related to the conversion of numbers to bigints in the apis and types. After some trial and error, we finally preferred to write our own codemod to change all of number types to bigints. The new fixed versions will be available soon on npm. We will also make the repositories public on GitHub in days.

🛡️ @rosen-bridge/ts-guard-service
EventProcessor module of guard almost refactored. Needs updates of  @rosen-chains to release which is in unit-test development stage. Also another update is needed in @rosen-bridge/tokens.

⚖️ @rosen-bridge/minimum-fee
A config, rsnRatioDivisor, updated in minimum-fee package, which was needed to support high decimal assets. This will be used in beta version.

⛓️ @rosen-chains
Most of Cardano chain implemented according to abstract classes. @rosen-chains updates are not yet applied to it.

[04/26/2023 6:57 PM] koutelier#0000
also we have a listing opportunity


[04/26/2023 6:58 PM] koutelier#0000
it has a small listing fee


[04/26/2023 6:58 PM] koutelier#0000
two options are available ,, either we dump some treasury for ergs to pay the fee


[04/26/2023 6:58 PM] koutelier#0000
or we crowdfunded


[04/26/2023 6:58 PM] cometeer#0000
fee for transferring the token is more expensive then hiring hooker


[04/26/2023 6:59 PM] cometeer#0000
try crow fund first then dump


[04/26/2023 7:00 PM] cometeer#0000
or half and half


[04/26/2023 7:00 PM] koutelier#0000
we could run a raffle.


[04/26/2023 7:09 PM] ratchpikor#0000
(re @koutelier : *it has a small listing fee*)
        
        How much?

(re @ratchpikor : *How much?*)
        
        i am afraid i can't tell


[04/26/2023 7:10 PM] koutelier#0000
also another think we need to considerate is that we will need ada to make a comet pool


[04/26/2023 7:11 PM] koutelier#0000
so we will need again to swap treasury for erg , send erg to ada, swap erg for ada and then provide liquidity

fr guys at some point we need to sell some treasury to prepare for ada pools and for future listing fees


[04/26/2023 7:24 PM] koutelier#0000
this is an investment on the token it self since with those movements people that are interested on $COMET they will have more ways of getting it


[04/26/2023 7:58 PM] cometeer#0000
ath is 83k

(re @ratchpikor : *I did not due to the high fees*)
        
        248000 comet minimum bridge fee just to test is too high.
If it was for real Cardano token it’s one thing but we basically pay Rosen Bridge to test with hard earned Comet


[04/26/2023 8:17 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @ratchpikor : *I have some ada if you want*)
        
        Lol or we can beg for liquidity


[04/26/2023 8:17 PM] koutelier#0000
That works as well lol


[04/26/2023 8:18 PM] ratchpikor#0000
Instead to sell comet you can give it to a diamond hands like me and exchange for ada 😉


[04/26/2023 8:21 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @cometeer : *ath is 83k*)

        Well yeah but if we have a cause and all or most of us agree then we can do it


[04/26/2023 8:25 PM] koutelier#0000
Some times sacrifices have to be made but maybe they are other ways


[04/26/2023 8:43 PM] ratchpikor#0000
Why we can't e.g
crowfound usdt or ada directly?


[04/26/2023 8:43 PM] ratchpikor#0000
