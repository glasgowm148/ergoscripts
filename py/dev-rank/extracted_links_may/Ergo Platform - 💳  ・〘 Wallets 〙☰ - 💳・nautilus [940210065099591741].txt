Guild: Ergo Platform
Channel: 💳  ・〘 Wallets 〙☰ / 💳・nautilus
Topic: We are going to research and rewrite the ErgoMixer`s off-chain logic in JavaScript and build a framework that can be used across wallets.

By providing these tools for the developers which can integrate the Mixer into their applications we expect to see a substantial increase of the Mixer`s usage and liquidity.

I will get Nemo in this channel. See where we can get started. 
Nemo is pretty far along on the build/testing.

Hey, Aberg! (re @mewtoshi: Hi)


[02/08/2022 9:41 PM] nemo429#0000
Do you know how to deploy the app on the Ledger device?


[02/08/2022 9:43 PM] nemo429#0000
I thinking on do some tutorial on how to do that, but time is short atm


[02/08/2022 9:45 PM] MrNautilus#0000
I think open documentation for the future would be a good thing to see with this ErgoHack as well as integration if time permits.


[02/08/2022 9:45 PM] nemo429#0000
One more question: will you add ledger support directly on Satergo?


[02/08/2022 9:45 PM] nemo429#0000
Sure thing (re @MrNautilus: I think open documentation for the future would be a good thing to see with this ErgoHack as well as integration if time permits.)


[02/08/2022 9:46 PM] MrNautilus#0000
Yeah the goal is to support Ledger integration into community wallets. So if we can help Satergo that would be good for the ecosystem. (re @nemo429: One more question: will you add ledger support directly on Satergo?)


[02/08/2022 9:47 PM] mewtoshi#0000
Ok so I might sound stupid now, but I don't have a Ledger. I thought I could implement a link to it either way and ask some friends to test
It is my intention to have the ledger support inside the core and not as a plugin or something like that,


[02/08/2022 9:47 PM] nemo429#0000
Of course! (re @MrNautilus: Yeah the goal is to support Ledger integration into community wallets. So if we can help Satergo that would be good for the ecosystem.)


[02/08/2022 9:48 PM] MrNautilus#0000
Isnt there an emulator? (re @nemo429: Of course!)


[02/08/2022 9:49 PM] nemo429#0000
It could be hard to test, specially because you will need to implement some kind of bridge for that, there is not Ledger transport library for java AFAIK (re @mewtoshi: Ok so I might sound stupid now, but I don't have a Ledger. I thought I could implement a link to it either way and ask some friends to test

[02/08/2022 9:50 PM] nemo429#0000
Well remembered! Yeah there is, lemme remember its name... (re @MrNautilus: Isnt there an emulator?)


[02/08/2022 9:50 PM] mewtoshi#0000
There are a few Java Bitcoin wallets that do have hw wallet support, and ledger has a 2-year old library as well which I could make use of (re @nemo429: It could be hard to test, specially because you will need to implement some kind of bridge for that, there is not Ledger transport library for java AFAIK)

[02/08/2022 9:51 PM] mewtoshi#0000
And the ledger core library has a flag to generate java glue code, so I could make use of that too maybe


[02/08/2022 9:52 PM] nemo429#0000
Sounds good


[02/08/2022 9:53 PM] nemo429#0000
If you follow this path you will need to implement a binding api for the APDU

Hello there


[02/08/2022 10:17 PM] haileypdll#3353
I'm also interested for possible ledger support to be integrated. But i'm at the stage: ledger will come soon, i've not yet checked how it could work.


[02/08/2022 10:18 PM] haileypdll#3353

I used to think that @MrNautilus and @nemo429 were the same person..


[02/08/2022 10:22 PM] MrNautilus#0000
@nemo429 is the brains


[02/08/2022 10:23 PM] mewtoshi#0000
I'm confused about APDU. It is a thing to access javacards? What? "Application Protocol Data Unit"?


[02/08/2022 10:26 PM] nemo429#0000
hey @haileypdll, I'm happy to see you here, great work on SAFEW btw


[02/08/2022 10:27 PM] nemo429#0000
Is the communication protocol user by Ledger app (re @mewtoshi: I'm confused about APDU. It is a thing to access javacards? What? "Application Protocol Data Unit"?)


[02/08/2022 10:27 PM] haileypdll#3353
Thanks, nautilus looks great too, but I'm still not running it to avoid a copy 😀


[02/08/2022 10:27 PM] mewtoshi#0000
It seems to be a thing invented by Java cards (micro cards used a lot for credit cards and sim cards etc) and then the standard got reused by ledger


[02/08/2022 10:28 PM] mewtoshi#0000
So, if it is actually like that, I could maybe re-use Java's APDU functions


[02/08/2022 10:29 PM] MrNautilus#0000
I played with SafeW before our dapp connector was live, it worked great. 
I'm really happy to see more alternatives coming out. 
Everyone has had yoroi pains for too long. lol (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <haileypdll> Thanks, nautilus looks great too, but I'm still not running it to avoid a copy 😀)


[02/08/2022 10:35 PM] mewtoshi#0000
I found multiple APDU implementations in Java, so far so good


[02/08/2022 10:36 PM] nemo429#0000
You need to implement a biding api using this documentation (re @nemo429: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z8nIlRmPhwcKzyZ2jZYYkaFDtLt8pgvnRWrT5zJJ_Tw/edit?pli=1#heading=h.hag83gqtujji)

Capt. Nemo, you are developing the application that will run on the hardware, right? That's the missing piece that has been the cause of ledger not having ergo support?

[02/08/2022 11:22 PM] mewtoshi#0000

[02/08/2022 11:23 PM] nemo429#0000

Nevermind, it is just that it does not work on my system


[02/09/2022 12:09 AM] SoCool#6419
Just a simple code snippet to poke at when you have time; just 70 lines and will give you current moment `tokenPerErg` for assets on dex. Will be useful to print next to dex tokens in wallet https://gist.github.com/JimmyHoffa/5964124ee7cc02b64b520dd72e2ccb80 - I carved it from ergodex codebase and stripped away all the deps save axios, mathjs (for good money math), and json-bigint - hopefully we can get use of some shared functionality in all the JS wallets

I'm truly confused whether Speculos is supposed to emulate a USB device on the host operating system or not. The documentation is so vague


[02/09/2022 1:08 AM] mewtoshi#0000
It isn’t possible to communicate with Speculos over USB (but APDUs can be exchanged thanks to a TCP proxy)
Found this. I'm unable to test anything. I will have to find somebody who wants to help.

Specifically with Nautilus, to avoid conflicts, you can call ergoConnector.nautilus.connect() in place of window.ergo_request_read_access and ergoConnector.nautilus.isConnected() in place of window.ergo_check_read_access


[02/10/2022 11:16 PM] nemo429#0000
But the old methods are also supported while we are in beta stage


[02/11/2022 9:58 AM] haileypdll#3353
I just followed the same pattern in safew, on the recommendation of anonbr, for future dApp wallet chooser

Awesome work! Will give it a try later today, thank you.

Really cool, what about a method for filtered results? something like `getLatestTokenSwapValuesFor(tokenIds: string[])`?


[02/11/2022 1:49 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Maybe some shorten method names, eg: `getTokenRateFor` in place `getLatestTokenSwapValuesFor`


[02/11/2022 1:51 PM] SoCool#6419
Yes, keep the commentary coming ! Would be great to have a lib with a clear simple interface for retrieving ergo data - the ergo-sdk-js on ergolabs has a bit too much going on in it to be really easy to use. Ease of use is what I'm focusing on with this


[02/11/2022 1:53 PM] SoCool#6419
The easier it is for people to get data about Ergo, the more we'll start seeing that data in all the different places, wallets, dApps, tools, whatever and I think that visibility is one of the big pieces missing from the ecosystem right now; as I sit here watching the charts run live on the dex tokens heh


[02/11/2022 1:54 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Sounds great! I like the idea of small libs for specific tasks btw. Really good job!

Hi! 
 - Initial connection and tx signing integration is done
 - Apparently ledger app has an issue with returned sign bytes (tesseract team is working on this AMT)
 - Working on UI refinements

Because i don't have a ledger myself and there isn't already a ergo ledger library for java, it is taking some more time, but
- USB connection is finished
- Started implementing the ergo ledger app protocol in Java

I'm shocked that I missed that, but alas it is not useful as I've already implemented the USB stuff (quite simple, 5 lines or something) and the rest (APDU protocol) is actually available in the Java core.
Right now, I'm implementing the specific ergo application protocol.

got my chart UI in that repo rendering off that lib - lib has all the interface functions implemented except marketcap (apparently you'd have to scan all boxes to get full token circulation amount - not going to go after that right now). Can get wallet valuations though with just an address input there - tells you how much erg$ your token balances are worth for an address 🙂

Tomorrow I'll add transaction munging to find sale/purchase right by each other - associate swaps and get the out value and in value so we can store "You spend X ergs at Y time for Z neta. That purchase is now worth A a shift of (+-)5ergs" or whatever


[02/12/2022 1:21 AM] SoCool#6419
Also going to dig out the liquidity position code from ergo dex code to get the simplistic minimal requests and calculations to say "This erg_neta_lp indicates you own a liquidity position of X" etc


[02/12/2022 1:22 AM] SoCool#6419
Add history tracking (local chrome storage based) and liquidity position information tomorrow.. All just data out of a lib, visualizations can be other people's game mostly 🙂

oh and tune the names down like you said because yeesh. Bad naming, I knew when I wrote them hah but whatever, got it working, now I'll rename stuff. Naming is hard.

Amazing news! Specially excited to see lp tokens calculation working

It might not be a good thing to manage storage from the library, let apps do that


[02/12/2022 1:58 AM] capt_nemo#3204
Totally agree, naming is hard, specially for non native english speakers lol


[02/12/2022 2:09 AM] SoCool#6419
Yeah, the storage I felt questioning on as you said, I'll leave that off then. I hope at some point someone will start storing historical price data though. I did try to make intelligent decisions for storage but consumers can implement their own storage mechanism.

ergo_orange (4) 

[02/12/2022 12:08 PM] SoCool#6419
Hows this sound for naming? 
```
export interface ITokenMarket {
  getSwappableTokens(): Promise<ITokenInfo[]>;
  // getTokenMarketCaps(): Promise<ITokenRate[]>; // Implementation pending endpoint on explorer presenting total circulating token amount
  getTokenRates(): Promise<ITokenRate[]>;
  getTokenRateFor(tokenIds: string[]): Promise<ITokenRate[]>;
  getTokenValuesForAddress(address: string): Promise<IAddressTokenAmounts | undefined>;
}
```

Behaviour wise - I tend to prefer to allow failure and let consumers decide on the result, so when an explorer request fails, the functions don't blow up they just hand back undefined or empty arrays. Less worry for consumers they're going to blow their stack from one of these calls


[02/12/2022 1:15 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Naming looks good, let's just rename `getTokenValuesForAddress`  to `getTokenRatesByAddress` to keep it more semantic 

On the behavior, I do prefer to allow failures, it can give more details on what's happening to the user. Returning `undefined` or empty arrays can confuse a bit

[02/12/2022 5:07 PM] SoCool#6419
Doesn't retrieve rates though; it gets the balance of tokens and tells you their value in ergs - for instance it would say `32 ErgoPad: 5ergs, 15SigUSD` etc to tell you your wallets worth. Also it has confirmed/unconfirmed/total so maybe `getTokenBalanceByAddress` ?

Perhaps `getAddressValue` or `getAddressWorth` ?

and I'll make a constructor param `throwOnError: boolean = true` then so consumers can get their desired behaviour, whichever it may be 👍

Nice solution for error handling


[02/12/2022 9:53 PM] mewtoshi#0000
I don't even know what you guys are discussing but if you provide some way to disable error throwing, there still must be a return value


[02/12/2022 9:54 PM] mewtoshi#0000
personally i've never seen errors that get disabled using a parameter, imo caller can just try { ... } catch (Exception ignored) {}


[02/12/2022 9:54 PM] mewtoshi#0000

[02/13/2022 7:09 AM] kii#8888
okay. that makes sense. Acting as a devil's advocate. If ergopay is generic to all wallet, whats the benefit of nautilus integration?


[02/13/2022 7:12 AM] root7Z#8699
dApps need to implement ErgoPay for their own, Nautilus is building a ready to use wallet approach I think

ahh that makes sense

{Reactions}
👍 

[02/13/2022 7:23 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Both approaches are generic, but not every dapp implements both. Nautilus supporting ErgoPay means that some features of ErgoPay can be used for dapps only supporting the web dapp connector. That's a good thing because some dapp devs might not have the resources to implement both.

[02/13/2022 10:31 AM] kii#8888
After working on the tutorial, i think I understand it better. ErgoPay is like generating a QR code that you can use your wallet app to scan, and it will ask to confirm the tx. Where as nautilus integration is similar to what metamask does, and it pops up and just asks to sign without the need to scan a qr code.


[02/13/2022 10:33 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
you can use a link for ErgoPay if you are on the same device. but yes, the idea is to make dapps work across devices.

4 or something protocol requests return a variable length response but there is no way to know the length before reading it, because it depends on whether something succeeded on the device itself

@anon_br No, I know how to get the return value. Problem is there are is one response that returns a data result only if it was successful. So, data+sw1+sw2 Otherwise it returns sw1+sw2 only.

[02/13/2022 7:06 PM] mewtoshi#0000
Most responses are a fixed length, so I just read (data length + 2), but in this case I can't do that, so unless there is a way to know where a response ends, or know the length of the response before reading it, I cannot read it @anon_br

Working on PR, pretty minimal but need a bit of guidance on how you want the `ergo-market-lib` pulled in - was thinking for security, instead of using compiled off npm - just fork the github and you can directly use the fork where you can guarantee the packages security - the repo is here https://github.com/JimmyHoffa/ergo-market-lib you can install it with `npm install git+git@github.com:JimmyHoffa/ergo-market-lib.git` - but fork it and install from your fork for wallet security I'd say.

The method call is wrong too? The protocol packet takes a BIP32 path, but the code uses bip32_private_key on the packet, and you aren't supposed to have the private key so it's not possible to use this method

Satergo ErgoHack III Report
Project: Implement Ledger support into Satergo
Tasks done:
- Implemented HID for Nano S and Nano X
- Implemented Speculos Ledger emulator interface
- Implemented the Ergo Ledger app protocol in Java
- Created utils to attest and sign transactions
- Integrated Ledger support into program
Both the Ledger interface library and the Ergo Ledger app protocol are reusable and can easily be integrated to other Java Ergo applications.
It is planned to publish them on Maven Central after the API has been stabilized.

Nautilus Wallet report:
 - Ledger support added using the `ledgerjs-hw-app-ergo` binding library
   - All ledger interactions are done, however transactions are getting rejected by the mempool due to an issue on the device app, which is being fixed by tesseract team.
 - Helped another teams with dApp connector integration

Implementation: https://github.com/capt-nemo429/nautilus-wallet/pull/6
Special thanks to @Dėdės šlapias bučkis for the amazing Ledger illustrations.

I forgot to mention, the protocol library can be used on Android as well


[02/14/2022 11:19 AM] capt_nemo#3204
Awesome! This way you are importing works perfectly for me.

Let's just remove that ERG rate and keep only USD, in the near future I want to let the user choose its preferred currency for that.


[02/14/2022 11:24 AM] SoCool#6419
👍  I'll leave valueInErgs in the store because that's the basis value rate in the pool, but I'll remove the display only displaying USD (valueInErgs * ergPrice). Other currencies I think you'll want to calculate off the basis rate similarly


[02/14/2022 11:42 AM] capt_nemo#3204
Yeah sounds like a great solution.

btw, from a second view, I think it's better to have some kind of version controlling on the library. Is it possible when installing from GH?


[02/14/2022 11:44 AM] SoCool#6419
It can reference tags or branches 👍  I didn't do anything like that as I wanted feedback on this solution first. If preferable I can work out getting it published into npm but I posed this for the transparency of the code considering the security ramifications. This eases auditability for instance over a pre-built npm package


[02/14/2022 11:46 AM] SoCool#6419
just append `#<commit | tag | branch>` so `npm install git+git@github.com:JimmyHoffa/ergo-market-lib.git#main` would work


[02/14/2022 11:51 AM] SoCool#6419
Just pushed up snipping out erg valuation. I had to do some small babel tweaks on my side to get the `?.` operator supported but I didn't push those up yet because I wasn't 100% confident they were necessary or minimal.. I'll poke at them. Also the linter complained at me persistently about this plugin it was unaware of until I commented it out - couldn't find where to install it from ? So imperfect linting on my code changes
```
     "@vue/typescript/recommended",
     "@vue/prettier",
-    "@vue/prettier/@typescript-eslint"
+    // "@vue/prettier/@typescript-eslint"
   ],
   parserOptions: {
```


[02/14/2022 11:57 AM] capt_nemo#3204
Makes sense, I think it should work better with tags then. I'm afraid of some breaking change inadvertently breaks on my side.


[02/14/2022 12:01 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Don't worry about that, when the PR is done I can check that and we see what can be done

https://github.com/capt-nemo429/nautilus-wallet/pull/5 Done - referencing repo tagged at 1.0.0, you can I believe make changes to the branch on my side due to it being a fork of a repo you own, or pull your own branch off it or however you may want to tweak anything. Let me know if there's anything more I need to do to get this moved forward 👍 it's nice being able to see my valuations in there 😄 Next I'm either going to start digging up liquidity pool positions to display or charting of the token rates...

Getting there - would appreciate some help @capt_nemo when you get a chance around how to manage the intervals for rate retrieval - balance update relies on updating rates but those are too frequent and infrequent. I can put a throttler to not get rates more than 1 a minute in the store but then I'm unclear what the current balance retrieval interval is and whether I should create a separate interval for rate retrieval?

[02/14/2022 10:30 PM] SoCool#6419
Is it every 30 seconds? The token prices do not move frequently.. perhaps I could throttle it further down to every 2 or 5 minutes? I'm also curious what your thought is on storing `N` array of historical in chrome storage so when you open it - it shows previous (timestamped) values as it starts appending new current ones to see where it's moved


[02/14/2022 10:31 PM] SoCool#6419
Storing some potentially large amount of data in chrome storage though is something I would want you to decide about heh

[02/14/2022 11:00 PM] mewtoshi#0000
Here is an unfinalized version of the library. @anon_br


[02/14/2022 11:01 PM] mewtoshi#0000
The ergo protocol is included in it as well.


[02/14/2022 11:02 PM] mewtoshi#0000
However, I have not included the signTransaction and attestTransaction utilites because those depend on appkit, so they should not be in the library itself. if you want to see them I can upload it to a gist


[02/14/2022 11:02 PM] mewtoshi#0000
I meant to say attestBox.

[02/15/2022 12:20 AM] anon_br#2282
Sorry, @mewtoshi but I don't se how attestInput and signTx depends on AppKit. Could you please clarify?


[02/15/2022 12:21 AM] mewtoshi#0000
@anon_br Because my impl of those methods use classes from AppKit. I could also re-create all those classes but that's annoying and hard to integrate


[02/15/2022 12:21 AM] mewtoshi#0000
box classes token classes etc. so it's not really any logic but only data classes


[02/15/2022 12:24 AM] anon_br#2282
Ideally the binding library should not depend on AppKit


[02/15/2022 12:24 AM] mewtoshi#0000
The library does not depend on appkit


[02/15/2022 12:24 AM] mewtoshi#0000
The signtransaction and attestbox methods are not inside the library


[02/15/2022 12:24 AM] mewtoshi#0000
I implemented them in my program instead


[02/15/2022 12:26 AM] anon_br#2282
Well, all the protocol implementation must remain in the binding api


[02/15/2022 12:26 AM] mewtoshi#0000
signTransaction and attestBox are not part of the protocol


[02/15/2022 12:27 AM] mewtoshi#0000
They are utility methods that just call a bunch of protocol methods


[02/15/2022 12:27 AM] anon_br#2282
Yes, they are


[02/15/2022 12:28 AM] mewtoshi#0000
For this reason they don't belong in the library, no? Or are your thoughts different


[02/15/2022 12:29 AM] anon_br#2282
I meant, they are part of the protocol


[02/15/2022 12:31 AM] mewtoshi#0000
startSigning, addInputBoxFrame, addInputBoxContextExtensionChunk, addDataInputs, addOutputBoxStart, addOutputBoxErgoTreeChunk, confirm, p2pkSign
These are part of the protocol


[02/15/2022 12:31 AM] mewtoshi#0000
signTransaction is just a utility that calls all those for you


[02/15/2022 12:31 AM] anon_br#2282
The intention behind a binding api is to wrap all the protocol implementation so another project can make use of that to quickly integrate, like @capt_nemo and @haileypdll did


[02/15/2022 12:32 AM] mewtoshi#0000
A protocol implementation and an application API is not the same


[02/15/2022 12:32 AM] mewtoshi#0000
Mine is a protocol implementatio


[02/15/2022 12:33 AM] mewtoshi#0000
Yours seems to be an application API


[02/15/2022 12:34 AM] anon_br#2282
Ok, do what you think is right


[02/15/2022 12:39 AM] mewtoshi#0000
I would love to publish those methods as a module, but if I define my own data classes, basically every Java/other jvm language ergo project will have to do tedious conversions. Or am I exaggerating?


[02/15/2022 12:47 AM] anon_br#2282
Which is worse, convert some data classes or implement all the attestInput and signTx call structure?


[02/15/2022 12:55 AM] mewtoshi#0000
Hm. Conversion is easy to understand, and the utils are quite low-level. You got a point


[02/15/2022 12:56 AM] mewtoshi#0000
I could have a base-ergo artifcat and a app-ergo one. First one only the protocol methods, second one includes the base and also utilities. And I could have an AppKit conversion class that doesn't bring in the dependency unless used


[02/15/2022 12:56 AM] mewtoshi#0000
99% would use app-ergo (if anybody would use the lib, that is)


[02/15/2022 12:58 AM] mewtoshi#0000
Or just one artifact really. The utilities are quite small

[03/12/2022 4:36 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Have tested pretty much every other function of the wallet in safari to be working except for the ergo address validator and subsequent sending of funds, i think this is due to the wasm modules not properly building from the extracted chrome plugin source archive

[03/14/2022 12:18 PM] glasgowm#9381
Likely it slipped out of the range you set and never completed. Refund and try with a higher slippage or lower amount


[03/14/2022 12:19 PM] 33ethereum#1122
Dang I'll look into it when I get another break at work. But i did check my erg balance and it is missing the right amount of erg. Is that what you mean by refund?


[03/14/2022 12:20 PM] glasgowm#9381
The erg would've been sent to the ergodex contract - but buying at the price you set would've lost you too much money within your slippage tolerance. You can refund any 'stuck' transactions from the ergodex history pane

[03/20/2022 9:39 AM] freebo01111001#6525
Stumbled on a pretty serious bug in nautilus chrome extension wallet. So what happened is I had two wallets, call them wallet A and B,, on ergodex I couldn't choose which one to use for swaps so I deleted wallet A from nautilus and made a swap with wallet B. All assets of wallet B were then sent to wallet A and the token I bought on ergodex also sent to wallet A. Wallet B empty. Luckily I have the recovery phrase for these wallets but this seems like a bug that needs fixing

[03/20/2022 10:41 AM] SloppySmurf#0000
The three key guys that left Emurgo last year implied that Emurgo was obsessed with monetizing and financially justifying every piece of work, so my guess is that Yoroi was neglected because it did not generate enough income for them. (re @Mrck: I'd say yoroi gave 0.1 fcks about wallet users...)

Hi developers, here is a question from Chinese Nautilus user:  Originally, the wallet has a total of 4620 ERGs. he only have had 2600 ergs swapped for ergopads.

You can select in Nautilus to use only one. The funds can't move by themselves though - do you mean when you're performing a tx ones you don't expect to move - do?

[03/22/2022 2:25 PM] hellyea#2223
So with that my Ergopad stake key also moved to another address. Maybe it can be a problem related to Ergopad?


[03/22/2022 2:27 PM] glasgowm#9381
Look on the explorer - every tx should be there with their timestamp. It's likely you done some sort of tx (any tx) and then the change was returned to a different address

I really like the $ valuation of coins, could you also add a total $ value for the wallet. When having like 10 tokens it becomes a thought im having.


[03/24/2022 10:53 AM] stergosz#0000
Hello, why does it show 2 addresses with different amounts of ERG in them? My mobile ERGO wallet seems to show the amount of one of them only and not the whole ERG I am hodling.

Bought nft for 20 coins.
20 coins were written off and another 300 on top
Now there are no coins no nft
So it's been half an hour.

Still planned I just postponed it due to its complexity. I don't want rely on a third part app to get this done, so I'll need to reimplement all the off-chain logic in TypeScript, which is not a simple task.
I'm also looking at the new mixing protocol proposed by scalahub

send the proxy address 0.01 erg first then refund

[03/25/2022 2:29 PM] glasgowm#0000

the error is because there’s not enough erg in the proxy contract to send (only SigUSD/SigRSV)

[03/25/2022 2:40 PM] vidicmu2301#0000
Not sure if I should try to claim again or there are some prob with sigmausd atm causing the fund stuck in proxy address


[03/25/2022 2:41 PM] glasgowm#0000
Double the fee when sending the first time


[03/25/2022 2:49 PM] vidicmu2301#0000
I also sent 0.01 erg, max the fee to 0.0055. Now lets see.


[03/25/2022 2:59 PM] vidicmu2301#0000
It failed and refunded automatically. I will use ergdex then.


[03/25/2022 3:00 PM] glasgowm#0000
There’s also minotaur wallet which you can do it directly in (at the same ratio as sigmausd.io)

[03/28/2022 8:38 AM] Luivatra#0000
@nemo429 the rounding error causes some issues in that it sometimes leaves 0.0001 behind and also seems like get_utxos is not returning boxes because it cant find the requested amount (because it finds xxxx.3738 instead of the actual xxxx.3739 for example) Not a big deal but breaking the otherwise smooth UX

Hey, this is already fixed on v0.3.0 which will be released this week.
I don't see how this could affect get_utxos since box values have no decimals. Is this reproducible?

well at least it is an issue when trying to send max from the wallet, it will leave 0.0001 behind. also it would be nicer if get_utxos would accept erg amount and a list of tokenid:amount pairs. Guess that would be an update to eip12 though


[03/28/2022 2:18 PM] Luivatra#0000
also I was wondering, sometimes the wallet will first sync when you open it, could it be a dapp connector method (like ergo.sync_wallet) to ensure we dont get already spent utxo's

you have to send all your ergs to your main address and then make that one your main address by clicking on the circle besides the address.(under the receive section)

You can use muliple wallets using the same seed phrase. If you can get Yoroi to load, just export transactions from there per usual. If not SAFEW can give you a list of transactions, although depends on your tax software whether it'll import on not.


[03/29/2022 2:01 PM] cafebedouin#0000
My understanding is that Nautilus will have transaction exporting functionality in the future.


[03/29/2022 2:02 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Also only have one wallet active at a time, if you are using the dapps connector.

Is there something fundamentally different in signing transaction for testnet via sigmarust? I tried to port the nautilus wallet to the testnet (for my own purposes), everything seem to work however, when transaction is signed and sent to the explorer it doesn't work. I tried to elaborate a bit a when I tried to relay transaction via testnet full node, I got response that the transaction inputs are not validly signed.


[03/30/2022 12:23 AM] nitram147#5106
When I compared example for using of sigma-rust inside of javascript (typescript), it seems to be equivalent for testnet and mainnet

do you need to delete 0.2.2 prior to installing 0.3.0 ?


[03/30/2022 2:51 PM] nemo429#0000
There is no need, it should be automatically updated by chrome

you are right, you can't select the "sending address"


[03/30/2022 4:10 PM] JOFLITO#0000
you can send all tokens

[03/30/2022 7:15 PM] JCFishing#0000
I noticed that too & that's why I asked.


[03/30/2022 7:15 PM] icelandgrandpa#0000
let's wait then:)


[03/30/2022 7:21 PM] brakende#0000
According to the github Firefox support was included two days ago. But I’d wait for a confirmation from Nemo that the store version is legit


[03/30/2022 7:38 PM] nemo429#0000
That's legit but highly experimental, it could still have some undetected bug, so use with cautious


[03/30/2022 7:40 PM] nemo429#0000
About v0.3.1, it was my fault, messed up with manifest file, and as the intent of this build was to be a internal testing one, I didn't see any problem with that

I have connected nautilus with ergodex in the past. Now I tried to connect to ergodex, and it asked me to connect again to the wallet, which is strange since I have already connected this dapp to the wallet
so I said yes and then I went to nautilus to check connected dapps, and there 2 ergodex
is this something normal?

Just remove both and refresh page and connect again


[03/31/2022 9:26 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
Could be since Nautilus updated on Chrome, ErgoDEX sees as two different things


[03/31/2022 9:26 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
And it was the same wallet?


[03/31/2022 9:29 AM] bernerami#0000
I had something similar just after the ErgoDex UI updated; showed connected to ErgoDex twice. I also deleted both and reconnected and everything now works fine! 👍


[03/31/2022 9:30 AM] Donalddd#2998
it is the exactly same wallet


[03/31/2022 9:31 AM] Donalddd#2998
but I don't know if any of those were updated. I for sure updated chrome itself a few days back


[03/31/2022 9:31 AM] Donalddd#2998
I will do as you said, remove them and connect again


[03/31/2022 9:36 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
Yeah both ErgoDEX UI and Nautilus have updated the last few days so this may be the cause, I am confident the above fix will work


[03/31/2022 9:39 AM] bernerami#0000
I brought this up in another forum, and probably more appropriate to discuss here, sorry. But at the moment I'm recalling that just following the Nautilus update to v0.2.2 there were some ErgoDex users reporting that their return tx's were being sent to a different wallet. I assumed it was because their UI was referencing an outdated cookie or something, but what do I know? And now I've had this experience of the same seed phrase restoring two different wallets in Nautilus. May I humbly suggest that possibly these are related?

That issue of change going to the wrong address was on the ErgoDEX side, it has since been patched, the wallet didn't matter in that situation!


[03/31/2022 9:41 AM] bernerami#0000
good to know, thanks!

Hi
Nautilus keeps creating new addresses and -seemingly randomly- rearranging my assets between them.
Why does it keep happening and how do I stop it.
These are my settings (have been for a while)

Are you swapping on ergodex? Currently ergodex will by default send assets to most recently created address rather than the one you have selected as default in nautilus. To fix this you have to choose the wallet address in ergodex ui


[03/31/2022 7:10 PM] Jεnniε D#0000
I already sent all assets to one address, which is checked, but it happened again

That's ok. I tried to go over each of the typescript files and if that file contained something related to the ergo (ergo-ts or wasm) I read it line by line and ported it to the testnet based on the documentation for ergo-ts/wasm. Unfortunately, it seems to be not working even when everything is done the same way (during transaction signing) as in the wasm tutorial for ergo testnet. Maybe I'm missing something, I don't know. I did searched over the typescript files for the import of ergo-ts/wasm libraries so I should really checked all of the files which need to be changed 🤷‍♂️

Minting address is determined by the first minting transaction input, so you need to consolidate your balance in your preferred address first


[04/04/2022 1:28 AM] Marcus#0000
Hiya. So, say I have 8 addresses.. All have funds, some a lot larger than others. Are you saying to make a certain addresses the mining address, all funds have to be transferred to it?

Nautilus will always choose the oldest boxes to avoid storage rent, so the only way to make sure that your minting address will be the one you choose is consolidating your erg to such address

Cant quite understand it.. It thats the mechanics of it, I would of thought an address that received funds a few days ago would not of been the minting address of an NFT, rather it should of used an address I have thats not sent or received funds in weeks?

Nautilus doesn't have control over transactions made though dApp Connector. The dApp build the transaction, Nautilus just signs and broadcasts it.
Ideally dApps should use get_change_address() to get the user's default address

Hi All, I have mentioned this already in a couple different places & haven't received any reply after waiting a few days, so I'll just post this here and not bring it up again. No idea what is causing this to happen or what the implications are, but hope this information is useful to someone. Take care! 😀
I have two wallets (A & B with two distinct seed phrases (obviously). On one device (MacOS 12.1, Chrome 100.0.4896.60), I initially had both A & B installed on Nautilus (v.0.3.2); deleted A and left B installed. Later, I deleted B & input the seed phrase for A, only to have it restore Wallet B. To double check that I am not somehow mistaken, I used the seed phrases for both wallets on other devices and browsers, and in every case they restored two distinct wallets. Going back to the initial computer, I deleted the wallet & restored and got the same result -> phrase A restores B. I then input the seed phrase for B without deleting the other (incorrectly) restored wallet B & now I have both A & B restored again (as separate wallets).

Like @cafebedouin said, usually this is a user mistake, its hard to manage multiple seeds 😅
The library used to derive addresses from mnemonic is  very well tested and widely used by a huge amount of wallets from different blockchains
You can always confirm if Nautilus is working right by restoring you seeds in another wallets, like Yoroi, SAFEW and so on.

Can you see what’s in someone’s wallet in nuautilus if the tokens are in one receive address and you send someone a diff receive address with nothing in it? Will he know your total wallet value?


[04/05/2022 10:29 PM] cardelayno#0000
he would only know what inside that single address, and any other address chained in that transaction. only with seedphrase you can tally up all your utxo addresses


[04/05/2022 10:29 PM] cardelayno#0000
if you need to cover your track you'll have to use ergomixer

So how does ergopad know your total wallet value when you only enter one receive address?


[04/05/2022 10:32 PM] hoskydex#0000
On their website


[04/05/2022 10:33 PM] cardelayno#0000
no it doesn't, only if you connect via dapp


[04/05/2022 10:33 PM] hoskydex#0000
Oh got it


[04/05/2022 10:33 PM] hoskydex#0000
Will nautilus make a easy interface for mixer?


[04/05/2022 10:33 PM] cardelayno#0000
mixer integration in the future


[04/05/2022 10:33 PM] cardelayno#0000
safeW already have it


[04/05/2022 10:33 PM] hoskydex#0000
Also is this the same with Ada?


[04/05/2022 10:34 PM] cardelayno#0000
i dont know anything cardano mixing, ergomixer is an app built for ergo chain.


[04/05/2022 10:34 PM] hoskydex#0000
Because when I connect my Ada wallet to cnft it shows all my assets

What’s safew?


[04/05/2022 10:35 PM] cardelayno#0000
a wallet for ergo


[04/05/2022 10:35 PM] hoskydex#0000
Safe?


[04/05/2022 10:35 PM] cardelayno#0000
i dont use cardano sorry


[04/05/2022 10:35 PM] hoskydex#0000

Cardano is utxo no?


[04/05/2022 10:36 PM] cardelayno#0000
yes


[04/05/2022 10:36 PM] hoskydex#0000
So should be the same


[04/05/2022 10:36 PM] hoskydex#0000
Is that the whole jist of utxo? That your wallet is private?


[04/05/2022 10:36 PM] cardelayno#0000
i remember even if i connect via dapps to ergodex, if my stake key is in a different address, it will not show the full staking amount


[04/05/2022 10:37 PM] hoskydex#0000
Yes


[04/05/2022 10:38 PM] hoskydex#0000
> *(re @cardelayno)*: yes 
Can you put nft through a mixer too on safew?


[04/05/2022 10:38 PM] cardelayno#0000
if you connect not via dapps and just read only, it can only read one address. I haven't used ErgoPay, maybe you can possibly increase your privacy using that.

If the question was for me, I can recognize the value in tight integration and having things just work. On the other hand, I've tried to do basic things with Apple users, like use bluetooth to exchange files, and I hate how even the most basic functionality has been turned into a proprietary product. So, I don't use Apple products on principle.

[04/06/2022 4:34 PM] cafebedouin#0000
@nemo429, noticed multiple connections to the same websites (both Ergodex and Ergopad). I'm thinking having multiples might create weird dapp behavior, like not recognizing whitelisted tokens in wallet. Not sure if this is a connector or wallet problem, but I thought I'd mention it.


[04/06/2022 4:37 PM] liquid_phase#4605
I understand this fully, and this is why Apple is still not an industry leader in the world of enterprise both at the level of cost of entry and interoperability between legacy devices


[04/06/2022 4:38 PM] liquid_phase#4605
But for home and personal use, they really have the niche and they're riding it


[04/06/2022 4:39 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i personally love not having to enter my personal email to use apps or signup for stuff, the private relay function is game changing for peace of mind. 
Android phones and windows PCs however all come preloaded will bullshit, especially in the USA where politics allows corporate to graze on people like livestock


[04/06/2022 4:40 PM] liquid_phase#4605
We recently bought a cheap 300 dollar laptop for our office, which had nice hardware on paper - but came loaded with so much bloatware from the manufacturer we had to spend an entire work day (my time plus another persons added to the cost of the laptop made the cost go up to 650) cleaning /optimizing the laptop to be useable


[04/06/2022 4:41 PM] liquid_phase#4605
the cheapest entry level for mac is the mac mini at 699 - but then the cost of software and hardware dongles to interface with potential legacy hardware makes that cost go up - plus once you go apple all machines basically need to be so for interoperability like you said - not great for a business unless its specifically an agency or business relying on macs, like designers and developers


[04/06/2022 4:42 PM] liquid_phase#4605
But after many years of working on PCs, android phones, blackberris, raspberris, linux, unix, etc - im just fuckin tired of fightin the fight - give me the damn walled garden


[04/06/2022 4:45 PM] liquid_phase#4605
ANYWAY - i still have no luck compiling nautilus for safari, it is able to load and open and create wallets or restore them, but it still wont recognize send-to erg address as legitimate no matter what address i use. i assume the problem is still the webpack compiling not registering for safari/swift

I solved the android problem with LineageOS. The only apps on my phone are the ones I put there. My phone also cost me $40 on eBay, has an exchangeable battery, and I've been using it for 3 years - after someone else used it for several (I think the Samsung S5 came out in 2014). Not possible on an Apple product. As for Nautilus, are you sure your walled garden is hassle free as you imagine, when not using Apple products? So, you have the same problem, when you're out of the garden, like here.


[04/06/2022 4:50 PM] liquid_phase#4605
yeah i personally am capable of fixing my iphone regardless of its repairability score, so i don't care about that

Of course, it won't have 5G. Always tradeoffs to consider.


[04/06/2022 4:52 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Exactly, its a nuanced conversation which isn't as simple as MAC VS PC or something. There's upsides and downsides and its mostly based on the type of user who's acting upon the device


[04/06/2022 4:53 PM] cafebedouin#0000
And often skill level and amount of bullshit you will put up with. An average user would hate my flickering screen when its cold out.


[04/06/2022 4:53 PM] liquid_phase#4605
is it worth spending 40$ on a battery and my time to fix it, when the apple care policy is 49$ and i can replace the phone twice in a year if it breaks?

the insurance model is something i appreciate more as i get older with more things to do and less personal time to fiddle


[04/06/2022 4:55 PM] liquid_phase#4605
the thing about the walled garden of apple, is that there's a gate you're allowed to walk through if you so choose. And brave enough gardeners can go out and forage and bridge some wild things back into the ecosystem, such as i am trying to do with nautilus.

the more people who have access to ergo wallets the better. you will not get someone to switch browsers out of preference just for one crypto


[04/06/2022 4:55 PM] cafebedouin#0000
I'm always trying new stuff. Walled gardens kill your ability to do that. Walled gardens are great for people that have specific things they want to get done, that are well-established and accounted for by the garden. Step off the ranch any, and I'm always stepping off the ranch, then it's even more hassle.


[04/06/2022 4:55 PM] cafebedouin#0000
But, granted, I'm in no way a normal user.


[04/06/2022 4:56 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
You can find good laptops and smartphones from non-Apple. For Android without bloat use Google or Motorola devices.
I never had a notebook with bloatware but I always bought Dells the last 15 years. Sure you won't find a Dell for 350€ but for 700€.


[04/06/2022 4:57 PM] liquid_phase#4605
^moto devices (atleast in USA) are manufactured by lenovo, and do have bloat on them for sure. The experience is highly different in the USA the deals carriers make with corporate developers for pre installed bloat


[04/06/2022 4:59 PM] liquid_phase#4605
for reference, i am a CTO and have been working in computing for over 18 years and have fixed many devices, apple, linux, pc, android, amiga, playstation, etc


[04/06/2022 4:59 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i have landed on the apple ecosystem out of years of trial and error and finally settling on ease of interoperability and more expensive but better manufactured hardware


[04/06/2022 4:59 PM] liquid_phase#4605
and now i'd like to give the nautilus channel back to nautilus discussion


[04/06/2022 5:00 PM] liquid_phase#4605
and figure out how we can make webpack compiling work during a swift language conversion for safari development build


[04/06/2022 5:02 PM] cafebedouin#0000
The only comment I'd make is that being a CTO is also a different view. No one ever lost their job going with Microsoft is ultimately an ease of operability position, one that makes perfect sense when trying to manage hundreds or thousands of computers. But, it's also a specific use case that influences how you look at computing.

[04/07/2022 12:13 PM] cafebedouin#0000
> *(re @ErgoBridgeBot)*: <abashai> That did work 
You could also click on the drop down to switch wallets. click on connected dapps, deleted Ergodex, close browser, open browser, go to Ergodex, and reconnect Nautilus using the other wallet. Easier to switch between browsers for different wallets, but it can be done.

Nautilus don't actively communicate with any dApps, it only "answer" when asked for something though API call. So you might be seeing are dApps calling their backend services.
Nautilus only actively communicates with three external services:
- Ergo Explorer API;
- ConGecko Price API; and
- NFT sandbox service.

@capt_nemo while searching for the issue on developer forums an issue that someone else encountered which is almost identical is due to using var more often than neccessary:
https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/38657#issuecomment-983359042

is this relating to your js files? i am noticing var names n,t,b,e,u, etc... but every time they're mentioned in the JS there is var in front of them but apparently you only need to var them once and then they're const or just callable via their name ( n,t,b,e,u etc without the var infront)

@capt_nemo so the tool i use converts a CRX file into an archive extraction which xcode can then convert into a swift / xcode project. I did not build the safari from your github source. I am wondering how i would turn your github source into CRX file for chrome

I have a Wallet loaded in the extention of both Chrome and a Brave browser. For some reason this wallet will not update the balance of Erg available ive sent it two transactions, both are confirmed in the Explorer. When I open the Wallet extention the little circle just blinks and blinks for hours next to STANDARD. All of the other wallets work just fine... How should I go about troubleshooting? Thanks!

[04/12/2022 10:52 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Weird, probably some explorer issue, can you send DM this wallet addresses so I can do some tests?


[04/12/2022 10:55 PM] nirvanush#0000
Hey, i have a feature idea, not remember if it already been mentioned, would be great to have an indication of how badly my balance is fragmented with boxes. Like if the number of unspent boxes is too high, have some warning about it and a button for consolidation “optimization” - not sure how to present it in a more user friendly way. I don’t lome the fact that user need to understand the concept of eutxo/box.


[04/12/2022 10:58 PM] nirvanush#0000
And another idea is to have an api for dApp developer with utility functions to easily create transaction. 
Something like. Nautilus.createTx(tokenId,amount,address) and it will generate you a transaction that can be signed and submitt


[04/12/2022 11:18 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Hey, both features are planned )


[04/12/2022 11:20 PM] capt_nemo#3204
This is very interesting since some dApps don't actually have to deal with boxes.


[04/12/2022 11:22 PM] capt_nemo#3204

One good feature would be selection of UTXOs which user want to use as input to transaction - it would improve privacy (unlinkability of user's different addresses).


[04/12/2022 11:24 PM] nitram147#5106
However this is "expert users" feature which wouldn't be used by many people


[04/12/2022 11:33 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Also planned. Initially, it will allow you to choose from which address you want to send a tx, fine grained utxo selection is a long-term goal

{Reactions}
👍 

[04/12/2022 11:39 PM] nitram147#5106
Address selection for the input (also for change probably) is enough for the privacy usage 🙂 UTXO selection is required only for more complex use-cases and can be implemented later. Or if nautilus have api to just sign specific transaction, someone could make website which will let you fine tune make your transaction and the wallet will only sign it 🙂

Another good feature will be to allow user connect multiple wallets to ergodex


[04/12/2022 11:41 PM] nitram147#5106
(Right now when there is some wallet connected, nautilus did not ask user whether he want to connect another wallet or use the wallet which was connected in the past)


[04/12/2022 11:43 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Sounds good, will talk with ErgoDEX team about that, maybe just a `disconnect()` method would solve this nicely )

I discovered this morning that you can install Nautilus on Android phone 

Instead of chrome, you need to use Kiwi browser (open source chromium base), and enable developer tools. 

Once dev tools is enabled in Kiwi, you can install chrome extensions in it. Went to Nautilus wallet extension page, installed it.

Nautilus now shows up at the bottom of the Three-dot/hamburger menu of the browser. When clicked, it successfuly directs me to the extension and starts the process of setting up a new wallet.

New wallet setup works perfectly. Just tested receiving of funds and it's working as expected. this is really cool!

Hi captain. A little UI suggestion - would be nice to see a litte icon near reciever address (ext address or my own). WIth ergodex default address i'm still forget to switch it to address set as default in my wallet and get all my coins to another address. then i should send them again to my main and it's very scary that i can just missclick and send all tokens to nowhere.


[04/14/2022 10:21 PM] icelandgrandpa#0000
and in reciever input would be nice to see begining of reciever address and it's ending.

[04/17/2022 8:07 AM] fruittree#0000
I think it is fair to say yoroi is a mess, some transaction history error had my wallet missing 5k erg, if i didn't notice there might have been no saving it. send all and making a new wallet didnt fix it even. (this was long before nautilus) So i needed to do a node wallet to retrieve it. No telling how many people have lost erg because of this issue and had no idea.

so +1 for maked a mess.

Hey, I saw sign_data method is not implemented yet. How far down the road it's on a roadmap? :)

Wanted to share how sign in with wallet is implemented on Ethereum/Polygon using metamask.
User sign a json and on backend it's getting validated. Now BE knows that client is the owner of public address.
On ergo we are currently imitating this by signing a transaction of sending funds to myself. 
Would be great to be able to do it in a proper way. I know at least two dApps that use it (the DIY way) and another two who want to have this functionality.

@capt_nemo Tested the testnet build


[04/27/2022 12:50 AM] nitram147#5106
Now it seems to produce valid signed transaction however it's not added to the mempool, even when I manually copy the transaction json a send it via swagger interface of the "official" kushti's testnet node


[04/27/2022 12:50 AM] nitram147#5106
(it returns the transaction hash, however it's not added to the mempool and not mined)


[04/27/2022 12:52 AM] nitram147#5106
To the UI side, it would be better to have some visual different between mainnet/testnet to be able to distinguish between the versions


[04/27/2022 12:52 AM] nitram147#5106
I would propose the following:

Change the icon color to the blue instead of yellow or to the cyan color


[04/27/2022 12:54 AM] nitram147#5106
(this would be symbolize that it's the testnet version)


[04/27/2022 12:54 AM] nitram147#5106
Great it would be really useful for some use-cases in the sigmastamp


[04/27/2022 12:56 AM] nitram147#5106
Once the testnet nautilus would be ready I can resume my part of work on the notarization service (unfortunately I haven't got any time for it in the last 6 months, however I would find time to finish it in the following month or two (hopefully), however it want to debug it on the testnet first).

One solution would be to encrypt the data - however, users had to agree on some password


[04/27/2022 1:08 AM] nitram147#5106
And this is where my EIP come into play


[04/27/2022 1:08 AM] capt_nemo#3204
I'm implementing this ATM


[04/27/2022 1:08 AM] nitram147#5106
Users don't have to agree on any password


[04/27/2022 1:08 AM] nitram147#5106
Password would be automatically calculated based on ECDH


[04/27/2022 1:08 AM] nitram147#5106
(because addresses contains publickeys)


[04/27/2022 1:08 AM] capt_nemo#3204
Wow, thats interesting 🤔


[04/27/2022 1:09 AM] nitram147#5106
It has however some things to keep in mind while implementing it to achieve maximum privacy


[04/27/2022 1:09 AM] nitram147#5106
That's the reason why I decided to make a whole EIP for it


[04/27/2022 1:10 AM] capt_nemo#3204
Yeah, makes sense. I'll implement it on Nautilus for sure

Let's pray 😅


[04/27/2022 1:13 AM] K#0000
Can you set custom node ips in the testnet build? GetBlok's testnet node is public and the mempool is working in case anyone needs to use it.


[04/27/2022 1:14 AM] K#0000
Also thanks for making a testnet build in general, very helpful for messing with wallet integration 🙂


[04/27/2022 1:15 AM] nitram147#5106
Currently the nautilus is using the explorer for the relay of the transactions

[04/27/2022 1:20 AM] nitram147#5106
In the future it would be however better to interact also with full-nodes


[04/27/2022 1:20 AM] nitram147#5106
Unfortunately if I'm right, right now full nodes don't support bloom filters


[04/27/2022 1:21 AM] nitram147#5106
In BTC there's a concept of bloom filters in SPV wallet, which increase the user's privacy a lot


[04/27/2022 1:21 AM] nitram147#5106
(node don't know which addresses are user asking for)


[04/27/2022 1:22 AM] nitram147#5106
Really simplified version would be something like this (just for explanation, in reality it's much more complicated): "Send me the UTXOs belonging to the addresses starting with 9A*"


[04/27/2022 1:22 AM] capt_nemo#0000

 Didn't know about that, will research a bit


[04/27/2022 1:23 AM] nitram147#5106
So the node only knows that the user is asking for addresses starting with 9A* but don't know the specific address - of course this generates a lot of bandwidth... User will then only select his addresses UTXOs and drop the remaining ones...


[04/27/2022 1:23 AM] nitram147#5106
But this isn't supported by the Ergo full nodes if I'm right

 Yeah, this is a good feature and makes the wallet portable on the screen if it's used to create a new window. Pinning the pop-up where the screen dimensions are optimized would look a bit cleaner.


[04/29/2022 4:34 PM] a34tjkx#0000

Anyone noticing a get_utxos bug where transactions aren't finding the ergo they need for fees when an asset such as a token doesn't have enough erg in the utxo its stored in?


[04/29/2022 5:12 PM] Marty#0000
across our dapps we need to advise users to send tokens with some ergo to themselves to get things working

 Is this reproducible? get_utxo() should return all boxes from all addresses, unless you are passing some tokenId as parameter

 it is happening when people try to unstake their ergoPad


[04/29/2022 6:14 PM] JOFLITO#0000
you can lock ergoPad for rewards


[04/29/2022 6:14 PM] JOFLITO#0000
you get a "stakeKey" token that lets you withdraw


[04/29/2022 6:14 PM] JOFLITO#0000
currently people need to have ergo on the same box of the stakeKey or it fails

I'm still not able to unstake on either Yoroi or Nautilus.  Anyone else having issues?  I've changed nothing in my setup prior to experiencing the errors today.

I went ahead and cleared cache, removed dapp connector, restarted my machine and then finally re-associated my wallet address along with new dapp connector link.  I'm seeing the following errors for each wallet.

Yoroi:  

1) Unable to unstake.  I get all the way to the Yoroi transaction popup.  Type in password and submit.  Tx id never shows on screen. "Claim with browswer wallet" button stuck on spinning circle.
2) Unable to redeem Paideia.  Same behavior as above. 

Nautilus:

1) Unable to unstake.  Just like Yoroi, I get all the way to submit, but then never see the tx id in the wallet.   I do get an error code however (attached)
2) Can successfully redeem Paideia.  No errors.  This is the only thing that works right now.

[04/29/2022 6:18 PM] Marty#0000
These are probably unhelpful for you Nemo


[04/29/2022 6:19 PM] Marty#0000
but what typically resolves the issue is we tell them to send the staking token and some erg to themselves in 1 transaction


[04/29/2022 6:19 PM] Marty#0000
then it works


[04/29/2022 6:19 PM] Marty#0000
lui thinks it has to do with the get_utxos request


[04/29/2022 6:36 PM] nemo429#0000
I'm guessing that no other boxes than staking key box is being included in tx inputs, this explains why this workaround solves it, you create a new box with the staking key and enough erg for the tx


[04/29/2022 6:37 PM] nemo429#0000
I can see how a bug in `get_utxos` could cause this, lemme check


[04/29/2022 6:38 PM] Marty#0000
> Marty re @nemo429: I'm guessing that no other boxes than staking ... 
 
 That was my guess as well


[04/29/2022 7:18 PM] nemo429#0000
As far as I can see, nothing wrong with `get_utxos`, also tried without success to simulate this, I have one staking key isolated in a box with the minimum nanoergs required box, but transaction is assembled nicely with two inputs: staking key + fee box


[04/29/2022 7:21 PM] nemo429#0000
So, if any user appears with this issue, please ask him to send me a DM so I can guide him on getting some HAR logs to see what is coming on

 Mostly yes, IndexedDb is very limited, so if your data structure isn't well planned and tested it's easy to fall in a trap and need to load all data set for a simple query.

 Where are you taking it from? In yoroi go to settings, wallet, then export public key


[05/05/2022 8:04 AM] Marcus#0000
I think in Yoroi it’s:

1. Transfer funds to another wallet
2. Go to browser extensions 
3. Click manage extensions and remove Yoroi.

 I think ledger live will come much much later.  It should be compatible with both nano s and nano x.  Does not make sense to go with older version of nano s.

Also @nemo429 could you add a saved address future at some point . so if i want to send something to a friend i won't have to search for the address every time.  i can save it and when i hit address text box saved address (with the name i choose to call each address)  will appear there.


[05/06/2022 12:12 PM] koutelier#0000
for example if i want to send something to my friend jose i just put one time his address on nautilus , save the address with the name "jose" and then just choose jose when i want to send something instead of typing the address

 You can just run ubuntu in Virtualbox on windows. That's what I did.


[05/07/2022 12:04 PM] nitram147#5106
Don't take me wrong but this is stupid idea. Because the linux is running inside the windows machine (in the virtual box) if the windows machine is compromised (and really huge number of windows machines is), thinking that running things in the virtual box is safe is false assumption. The windows machine can still track the keyboard, record screen, etc. So it has little security benefit 😉

(re  : *<nitram147> Don't take me wrong but this is stupid idea. Because the linux is running inside the windows machine (in the virtual box) if the windows machine is compromised (and really huge number of windows machines is), thinking that running things in the virtual box is safe is false assumption. The windows machine can still track the keyboard, record screen, etc. So it has little security benefit 😉*)

 Someone asked in the main Ergo chat for a way to export or display the seed. I checked Nautilus, and I didn't see it. Thought I'd mention it here in case that can be done safely in an extension wallet.

(re @FidgetyRat : *Any issues out of the ledger beta yet? I’ve got an X so can’t play along.*) 
 
 right now it doesn't work with transactions with too many tokens inside it, >6 tokens i think. i think due to nano s memory limitation. ledger team have to find a way to make it happen.

Hey @nemo429 
Eternl wallet for cardano is able to integrate into Koinly via export of public key

Any idea what the difficulty of integrating something like this would be, and how as a community we might be able to push for better integration into koinly so users can track their taxes?

koinly added cardano native tokens integration as well


[05/15/2022 2:35 AM] NoahErgo#0000
I know yoroi had a public key for read only wallets, maybe that is something that could be useful for this? Currently in nautilus you are not able to export a read only key

(re @glasgowm : *Think it still needs to be approved by the ledger app store*) 
 
 I''m guessing the release means the nautilus wallet is ready for ledger once the ledger team approves it.
You can sideload the app onto nano s (not plus or x) if you get beta access (ask the cptn).
It works great.


[05/22/2022 11:23 AM] Maarten_V#0000

Hmm, I see two options here:

2. Call Nautilus through Chrome native messaging protocol, but I need to do some changes from my side support it -actually you gave me ideas, sir 🤔

Can an exodus Wallet work on an ergo platform?


[05/26/2022 5:37 PM] curbsideprophetz#0000
(re @Allison : *Can an exodus Wallet work on an ergo platform?*) 
 
 exodus does not have support for ergo yet (edit: see https://www.exodus.com/status/)


[05/26/2022 5:40 PM] Allison#0000
Thanks for your response. As someone just starting out in the crypto world, It’s so confusing to me why every platform has its own wallet I have to sign up for instead of being able to connect my exodus Wallet as an extension if that makes sense.


[05/26/2022 5:42 PM] curbsideprophetz#0000
(re @Allison : *Thanks for your response. As someone just starting out in the crypto world, It’s so confusing to me why every platform has its own wallet I have to sign up for instead of being able to connect my exodus Wallet as an extension if that makes sense.*) 
 
 yeah it does make sense but also an indicator that you are in the game early.

for starters: each blockchain has their own protocol and idiosyncrasies. so for people to actually hold their coins they need to create their own wallet first. it doesn't make sense for someone like exodus to integrate a new blockchain if it started a couple days ago that is time wasted they could've been doing something else if they don't even know if the project will still be there 1 year later. so each platform building their own wallet first makes more sense.

welcome to the world of decentralization ;)


[05/26/2022 6:08 PM] Allison#0000
Do you see a future where there will only be a select few wallets in use instead of 100s to choose from? And will the ETH platform accept Nautilus Wallet and vice versa?

(re @Allison : *Do you see a future where there will only be a select few wallets in use instead of 100s to choose from? And will the ETH platform accept Nautilus Wallet and vice versa?*) 
 
 You're talking about something like Metamask, which does multiple chains. At some point, someone will write an interoperability standard for wallets and chains, but we aren't there yet.

@capt_nemo none of the transactions show up in the mempool with the testnet wallet

and I cannot send ERG to other testnet addresses


[05/29/2022 1:56 AM] MGpai#4313
I made sure to isolate the issue and checked if it is a testnet explorer issue

[05/29/2022 5:26 PM] cardelayno#0000
(re @Tchitombam : *Thank u

 there is a limit of 10 different tokens in one transaction so if you have more than 10 type you have to send the extra out to another address first

You can side load (a bit difficult) on a nano s. Or just wait for the official download

v0.4.1


[05/30/2022 2:32 AM] MGpai#4313
I also compiled the main branch and tried it out


[05/30/2022 2:39 AM] capt_nemo#3204
That’s weird, due to testnet explorer mempool issues, this version submits testnet transactions direct to a node, will check the node


[05/30/2022 2:39 AM] MGpai#4313
I changed it to my local node and still nothing happened


[05/30/2022 2:39 AM] MGpai#4313
how does mainnet submit?


[05/30/2022 2:43 AM] capt_nemo#3204
It submits to the explorer api


[05/30/2022 2:44 AM] MGpai#4313
ah interesting


[05/30/2022 2:44 AM] capt_nemo#3204
Did you check the node’s mempool?


[05/30/2022 2:45 AM] MGpai#4313
no is that like an api request?


[05/30/2022 2:45 AM] capt_nemo#3204
Testnet transaction will only appear in explorer after confirmed


[05/30/2022 2:45 AM] MGpai#4313
yes


[05/30/2022 2:45 AM] MGpai#4313
but only for your wallet

[05/30/2022 2:47 AM] capt_nemo#3204

I didn't realize different ledger devices allowed different apps


[05/30/2022 3:38 AM] indigo#5500
ie the nano s allows ergo but not nano x


[05/30/2022 3:38 AM] CW#0000
nano s allows sideloading of apps. nano x need to source from ledger live. waiting for review from ledger live


[05/30/2022 3:39 AM] indigo#5500
What about nano s plus?


[05/30/2022 3:40 AM] CW#0000
I believe its the same as with the ledger x. it'll come soon enough, Ive been using the mobile wallet cold storage feature in the meantime and works a treat


[05/30/2022 2:25 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
testnet mempool worked for me yesterday (five hours before your message). maybe it has something to do if the tx is uploaded via explorer?

{Reactions}
🔥 (2) 

[05/30/2022 3:42 PM] MGpai#4313
Isn't it a bit unsettling txs can hide from the mempool?


[05/30/2022 3:42 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
the explorer mempool is unreliable anyway, that's why appkit checks mempool from node


[05/30/2022 3:43 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
and if you now ask again why it is unreliable and the node is reliable... that's a question to ask the explorer devs


[05/30/2022 3:44 PM] MGpai#4313
Do nodes hold mempool for everything or just the txs it received?


[05/30/2022 3:45 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
not sure. since wallet app checks the node it submitted to anyway it does not matter for my use case - but in theory waiting transactions should be distributed to other nodes


[05/31/2022 4:46 AM] MGpai#4313
@capt_nemo txs between addresses seem to work with nautilus testnet however, it still does not show up in the mempool

 No. It’s not supported right now because the firmware app isn’t officially past approval by the ledger team. It will come.

The only reason the nano s has it is because it has developer manual side loading of unofficial apps.

@nemo429 I have an urgent request.

Yesterday I burned almost $15k worth of tokens testing a new swap app i found that had implemented nautilus wallet connection. Unfortunately they did not program so that native tokens were included in the outputs, just the ERG. 

On the Nautilus sign transaction screen there is no way to verify what is happening with the UTXOs, or if tokens might be burned in the process. I think if it happened to me it could happen to others too if there isnt a kind of warning or something in place. Could it be possible to flag on the transaction signing window if tokens are going to be burned? Or show what the UTXOs are going to do?

I am able to move forward from this loss but I am worried that if it happens to others they may not be able too. It is a really bad situation and I think some simple UX changes could be added to help with this.

 This is terrible. ViaWallet did the same to my NETA, I only lost 4k NETA though. I feel - due to the open-source nature of Ergo - it would be beneficial to change the architecture if possible in order to not allow processing transactions unless all boxes are accounted for. This will happen again and again, and we can’t force a dev to update their code. I believe the only way to get around this is to not allow this behavior.

 the ability to burn tokens is a feature not a bug. The problem is that in certain instances there aren’t failsafes in place to prevent it from happening when it is not intended. On the node you have to explicitly state which tokens you want burned. I guess on the dapp connector, and probably viawallet as well, that is not the case. I think there is a larger discussion ongoing between devs about ways to remedy this problem. Maybe having a more explicit option for which tokens are being burned in the dapp connector would be a good solution to this

 I do understand this. I am a dev myself. I believe burning should be explicit, it should not be allowed to happen by chance under any circumstance.

(re @eutxopool : *I do understand this. I am a dev myself. I believe burning should be explicit, it should not be allowed to happen by chance under any circumstance.*) 
 
 Except, there's no way to enforce that behavior on chain. If it's not in the outputs, it is burned. Presumably there is some way to screen inputs/outputs before transactions are generated or signed, but it's not a feature of the chain.

[06/14/2022 8:35 AM] Flying Pig#0000
Same here. It takes forever to sync. 
I have a lot of addresses and even though I consolidated the contents it's still taking a while...

I'm guessing nautilus checks the contents for each one of those used  addresses against explorer? (Even if it's empty)

And explorer can be very slow at times when loads of people are using the network. Need more explorers  :)

[06/14/2022 11:14 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Yeah more explorers should be everyone on the network’s current priority. I can’t sync my iOS wallet at all, nautilus is slow, and I can’t even log into sigma valley. Not a good impression for new Ergonauts. I was actually surprised that this wasn’t a focus of ergohack. It all reminds me of Yoroi.

[06/15/2022 9:16 PM] nemo429#0000
Not totally precise since it hasn't direct access to graphql db.

You can imagine ergo-graphql as a highly customizable and cachable alternative to the current explorer api

 Not totally precise since it hasn't direct access to graphql db.

You can imagine ergo-graphql as a highly customizable and cachable alternative to the current explorer api

Nautilus looks to be mostly .ts too so don't think there's anything specific to .js. 

Some related links (few .js examples)

 Sure, he can use sigma-rust's ergo-lib-wasm for that: https://github.com/ergoplatform/sigma-rust

Some usage examples:

i think there is no way to export your seed phrase in nautilus yet. but you could  export your Extended Public Key and then add a new read only wallet to check if you can see your balance there.

 Oh yeah I understand what you meant, sorry - I wonder what blocked that tx execution in the wallet, it was a very simple tx and all my nfts are in different boxes, a maximum of 6 per box I think

(re @eutxopool : *Oh yeah I understand what you meant, sorry - I wonder what blocked that tx execution in the wallet, it was a very simple tx and all my nfts are in different boxes, a maximum of 6 per box I think*) 
 
 No problem! ☺️ Does it relate to assets per box or is it just total unique assets per wallet address possibly?


[06/29/2022 9:40 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
Because generating the tx will be the same no matter what boxes are there, the tx generated will be a lost of all assets related to your address


[06/29/2022 9:40 AM] eutxopool#0000
(re @Gazza_SP : *No problem! ☺️ Does it relate to assets per box or is it just total unique assets per wallet address possibly?*) 
 
 Most likely per wallet address - ERG is on main address, subaddresses contain 11 aneta angels, 3 cybercitizens, I have 2 empty subaddresses and one with 0.001 and 1 erg each


[06/29/2022 9:41 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
I think you can see the tx log and what it contains in console when you try to submit and gets rejected, might help troubleshoot possibly

@capt_nemo have you ever considered putting a 'consolidate assets to one box' function for nautilus so that a user can easily consolidate all their erg to one spending box without having to initiate a transaction where they copy and paste their own address? a simple button and tx signing based on the selected primary address could be beneficial to people who perform many small transactions and who want to keep the blockchain /explorer neat

@nemo429 would it be possible to add an option for a wallet to present its “given” name through the dApp connection? On ErgoDex for example, it would let one immediately know which of one’s walled is currently connected (and if you offer this feature, it looks like they would take care of their end). TIA

 No codding skills needed man, If you want to help, try to bribe Ledger’s project manager to put Ergo integration higher in priority list. 
Talk to him in private, send him erg via mixer.

Or make him fall in love with your sister. Then she will tell him she is invested in Ergo, he will try to impress he by adding ergo to ledger.

 What app was used that burned the nfts?


[07/08/2022 4:35 PM] M#0000
Nautilus itself. I was sending 5 NFTs to Ergosaurs minting address, as they have an event going on right now. I had 3 boxes containing 274 NFTs - 5 were sent to the address as I set up but the remaining assets did not get added to the boxes refunding me, so they were burned.

 Just to clarify, you send a certain amount of erg from the Nautilus’ “Send” tab, right?


[07/08/2022 4:43 PM] M#0000
Correct. I sent only 0.001 ERG and 5 tokens. Usually nautilus is responsible for spending the appropriate boxes, and creating a new box (sent back to my wallet) containing leftover funds and tokens. But the tokens did not get written into the box, so they were burned.

[07/08/2022 4:52 PM] M#0000
I don’t know if it’s an issue with the volume of the tokens vs the small number of funds to work with, or what. I notice that no more than 100 tokens get put in a box, maybe there were not enough funds to split into 3 boxes? I understand that this logic may not be the easiest to recreate.

Maybe some developer "option" which in case it's enabled will show the whole transaction in json format after pressing of "send" button before relaying it to the network in order to get user approval will be really useful in many usecases when advanced user want to be 100% sure that transaction will look like he want 🙂 @capt_nemo

That wouldn't be enough, Nautilus don't show (at least for me in testnet version v0.4.2 when using dApp connector) the change in the confirmation dialog. Thus if the change was somehow bad crafted user can't detect it (for example that it's burning the tokens - but it'd be probably handled by the token burning warning). Another thing that is not shown are spent input boxes. So some special mode for advanced users will be more than welcomed (at least for me) - so I can be sure that my transactions are crafted as I want them to be 🙂


[07/08/2022 6:59 PM] nemo429#0000

 Just confirmed it is a sigma-rust bug, will let greenhat know about that.

I managed to simulate your transaction and the weird thing is there are a change box, for for some reason sigma-rust is not adding the tokens to the change box.

Maybe something related to max box size limit, when I manually remove a few tokens from the input objects, everything goes well


[07/08/2022 7:26 PM] nirvanush#0000
Man, it’s fucked up. I told it already on discord and I’ll say it again buring API the way it works right now is wrong on the base level


[07/08/2022 7:27 PM] nirvanush#0000
You can simply burn tokens like that by not including it in the outputs because of some third party lib bug

[07/08/2022 7:30 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
Hiya, possible issue with the new node tx interpretation? I.e. Attempt to include >100 tokens in the input, and the 'assets' part of the box isn't valid, but the rest of tx is. So it sends Ergs, burns tokens.


[07/08/2022 7:30 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#0000
I've seen behaviour like that myself when messing up a token's ID when building tx's manually. It sends the box but not the tokens


[07/08/2022 7:31 PM] nirvanush#0000

It makes sense for me, tokens are burned in the same way they are created.

> If you want to burn, you should omit an existing token from outputs.


[07/08/2022 7:37 PM] K#0000
I feel like api for submitting transactions to explorer needs to match the node api, where burned assets are explicitly defined

 Yeah but creating tokens is not that dangerous as burning it. So it’s not supposed to be symmetric


[07/08/2022 7:50 PM] nitram147#5106
That doesn't matter


[07/08/2022 7:50 PM] nitram147#5106
You want to make sure that the wallet generated the transaction which user desired


[07/08/2022 7:50 PM] nitram147#5106
For example, that it does not burn tokens in it if the user don't approve it


[07/08/2022 7:51 PM] nitram147#5106
Same way you want to make sure that when node accept some transaction, it will be mined as exactly the same transaction as received (if the problem was on node side)


[07/08/2022 7:52 PM] nitram147#5106
Relying upon third party libraries can always be a source of many problem, thus software which use that library should assert that it received result which that software wanted to receive from the library calls


[07/08/2022 7:52 PM] nitram147#5106
This way I will not matter how is the token burning implemented in the protocol


[07/08/2022 7:53 PM] nitram147#5106
And it would also prevent any other possible bugs which we don't yet know about


[07/08/2022 7:53 PM] K#0000
Imo people can always create their own libraries with buggy implementations. Given that the node and explorer are the "gatekeepers" into the blockchain, it should be on them to be as diligent as possible and ensure that burning of tokens is explicit. That's true for other parts of transaction modelling as well.

 This


[07/08/2022 7:59 PM] K#0000
I dont think it requires any lower level changes either. The actual way tokens are burned is fine, but more checks need to be done on the API that's used to interface between a client and the node/explorer. Adding a simple assetsToBurn field would go a long way.

Is there any reason why nautilus uses explorer to submit transactions instead of directly to a node?


[07/09/2022 10:19 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
needs https. the explorer endpoint just relays to the node behind explorer

(re @M : *I don’t know if it’s an issue with the volume of the tokens vs the small number of funds to work with, or what. I notice that no more than 100 tokens get put in a box, maybe there were not enough funds to split into 3 boxes? I understand that this logic may not be the easiest to recreate.*)

Is there a reason that we aren't as a platform performing some form of repository/depencency control and locking working versions into the system until newer versions are tested?

 This is an emergency patch, it will be not possible to send burning transactions through "send" tab.

Now I'm going to add the transaction visualization screen to regular transactions, this way the users can see the generated transaction before to sign, just like in dApp Connector.

 I still think this is a bandaid solution and there needs to be explicit decision to burn added

 nautilus is a desktop browser extension. wallet apps on android are apps that tend to have built in web browser, it would be a lot of work especially for one dev.

if you want to use nautilus on android you can use Kiwi Browser.

 Ive been using ledger for a while now (sideloaded on nano s) but I like having multiple cold wallet for various holdings. You never know if you lose the seed to one for whatever reason....and the android cold wallet just works great.

No, on skyharbor front end I got a "transaction failed", but i managed to glimpse for a nano second that the nautilus said "too many token" (the screen was only visible for a fraction of a millisecond!

i'm on 0.42 (modified explorer address)....maybe that's a problem..let me update


[07/13/2022 6:53 PM] Flying Pig#0000
still same issue with 0.44


[07/13/2022 6:55 PM] koutelier#0000
@nemo429 sir


[07/13/2022 6:57 PM] Flying Pig#0000
Interestingly I had a problem with ergodex earlier today, i tried to buy a large-ish amount of tokens. I got a "transaction failed" error no matter what I tried.
I then did a small swap for another token, tried the "big" swap again and it worked.

I suspect that if I send myself a smaller amount of erg rather than the whole balance, it will probably work.


[07/13/2022 7:01 PM] Flying Pig#0000
Ok, used safe wallet and it gave me a more helpful message....

[07/13/2022 7:02 PM] Flying Pig#0000
In nautilus (and safew for that matter) I clicked the button to select all which does leave 0.0011 for the fees, but seems that's not enough?


[07/13/2022 7:04 PM] Flying Pig#0000
Alright, i sent myself all my erg - 0.5 and the transaction went through.
So perhaps there needs to be a better error message displayed rather than "Too many token" :)


[07/13/2022 7:04 PM] Flying Pig#0000
Hopefully that should make skyharbor work once transaction is confirmed.


[07/13/2022 7:14 PM] Flying Pig#0000
Yup....after that last transaction of sending myself all erg-0.5 the skyharbor purchase went through...

 Sort by price and box height, means you will round robin through best price for the user would make sense imo

might pick up some shirts from them but that's the dilemma


[07/17/2022 7:43 PM] TechnoRanter#0000
If I'm supposed to HODL, but I spend some crypto to buy a HODL tshirt, have I broken the HODL?

going to stack ergo, flux, rvn, etc, and BTC during this bear market so the hodl is important

I'll probably set up a temp nautilus if I purchase some ERG or swap mining earnings and then send the coins to my ledger once the ledger dev team wakes up from their slumber and approves the app lol

 You can create a cold wallet with an old android or iOS device and ergo mobile wallet


[07/17/2022 7:46 PM] TechnoRanter#0000
oh right


[07/17/2022 7:46 PM] koutelier#0000
Until ledger is here


[07/17/2022 7:46 PM] koutelier#0000
Or a paper wallet


[07/17/2022 7:47 PM] TechnoRanter#0000
yeah I'll probably do that


[07/17/2022 7:47 PM] koutelier#0000
They are solutions


[07/17/2022 7:48 PM] TechnoRanter#0000
The worry on my end though is that I rooted my android phone, so I'm worried about how the security would be for long term storage there


[07/17/2022 7:48 PM] TechnoRanter#0000
Granted, the risk is probably less than setting up a wallet connected to the internet at all times on my pc

(re @TechnoRanter : *The worry on my end though is that I rooted my android phone, so I'm worried about how the security would be for long term storage there*) 
 
 Create a paper wallet


[07/17/2022 7:49 PM] koutelier#0000
Or just wait for nautilus ledger integrations . Or buy a nano s


[07/17/2022 7:49 PM] TechnoRanter#0000
yeah it'll be short term so that's my plan for the meantime


[07/17/2022 7:49 PM] koutelier#0000
If you really want to put them in the ledger buy a nano s. And sideload nautilus


[07/17/2022 7:50 PM] TechnoRanter#0000
Thanks for the advice, Koutelier and I wish you the best, man


[07/17/2022 7:50 PM] koutelier#0000
If you are not planning on using your wallet daily . Create a wallet . Then remove nautilus and send everything there


[07/17/2022 7:51 PM] TechnoRanter#0000
Also what is COMET token lol


[07/17/2022 7:51 PM] TechnoRanter#0000
I'm guessing it's an ergo meme token but im slightly confused

Ergo address contains 4bytes checksum. In case that you fill wrong length address it will automatically fail, but even if you enter address with correct amount of symbol but replace one or more of them, thank's to the 4 byte (32 bits) long checksum there's only 1 in the 2^32 (1 in 4294967296) chance that the resulting address will be correct. So you can be almost "sure" that when you are not extremely unlucky (1 in 4294967296) if you made typo in the end of address it will invalid address thus the sending will fail 🙂

 It’s good to know, thanks!
But +1 for showing a the last 4 symbols of the address. As a user I sometimes send funds between different wallets I own, and this chars sequence doesn’t tell anything to me, I only remember the last 4 chars of my address. It would be helpful to verify the address before sending something. The adress can be valid but wrong.

(re @nemo429 : *Babel Fees implementation is almost done, just a few UI tweaks needed to start the beta testing phase*) 
 
 How will the backend fee order matching work?


[07/25/2022 3:40 AM] NoahErgo#0000
For this to work there has to be people willing to buy your tokens right?


[07/25/2022 12:51 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *How will the backend fee order matching work?*) 
 
 No backend is needed, matching is done by Nautilus. It will always choose the best price  available


[07/25/2022 12:57 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *For this to work there has to be people willing to buy your tokens right?*) 
 
 Yup, liquidity providers, basically they will create the so called babel boxes (you can think this as an ERG selling order) filled with ERG and setting the price they are willing to sell the ERG for a specific token.

(re @nemo429 : *Yup, liquidity providers, basically they will create the so called babel boxes (you can think this as an ERG selling order) filled with ERG and setting the price they are willing to sell the ERG for a specific token.*) 
 
 So if users choose for example comet for fees the ergs in the pool can run out eventually right ?


[07/25/2022 1:10 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @koutelier : *So if users choose for example comet for fees the ergs in the pool can run out eventually right ?*) 
 
 Exactly, but different babel boxes with different prices can be made


[07/25/2022 1:17 PM] nemo429#0000
If a box runs out of ERG, another one can be chosen


[07/25/2022 1:53 PM] koutelier#0000
Anyone can add liquidity to the babels boxes ?


[07/25/2022 2:00 PM] nemo429#0000

 Yeah, anyone can create new babel boxes for any token

[07/25/2022 7:13 PM] nitram147#5106
Liquidity management website is done (in current state it's more than enough for testnet purposes, in future however there are needed some webdesign updates together with better scalability for mainnet usage). Contract is the same as proposed back in January. Nemo is finilizing alpha version of testnet nautilus babel fees integration.


[07/26/2022 12:06 PM] nirvanush#0000
Hey @nemo429 ! A small suggestion, I don’t know how other people feel about it. But one of the most frequent actions I do is to go to the wallet and copy my receive address. Right now I have to open the dapp connector, then go to the receive tab and click on copy. Would be great to have the receive address somewhere on the main screen. above the assets table or next to the table header in right corner. Not even the address, but just the copy button

not an alert but under the line that tells you that you need 0.0001 a text to guide people to remove the input ?

In the wallet, as a whole, how many tokens do you have?


[07/30/2022 1:02 PM] nemo429#0000
Distinct tokens*


[07/30/2022 1:03 PM] eutxopool#0000
14 - 5, 6 and 3 on different addresses respectively, each with exactly 0.001 ERG


[07/30/2022 1:04 PM] eutxopool#0000
I can use my Ledger with SAFEW with no issue - I know there is some memory limitation with Ledger but I'd assume that it's independent of the wallet software I'm using

(re @eutxopool : *14 - 5, 6 and 3 on different addresses respectively, each with exactly 0.001 ERG*)

 In SAFEW you can choose the source address, maybe this is avoiding token boxes  from another addresses to be included


[07/30/2022 1:06 PM] eutxopool#0000
(re @nemo429 : *In SAFEW you can choose the source address, maybe this is avoiding token boxes  from another addresses to be included*) 
 
 I didn't though, the address in question is the original address on the wallet if that helps


[07/30/2022 1:07 PM] eutxopool#0000
so it's not a derived extra one


[07/30/2022 1:08 PM] nemo429#0000

(re @Kai : *do you think in the future it would be possible to have a accept/decline option for deposits into a wallets*) 
 
 I think it makes sense
Not allowing some outside entity to approve a token, but just telling the user she has token coming in, and does she approve the deposit. It should be an option that one could toggle. I would accept any token, unless this is a wallet I want to keep for a specific purpose, or unless someone would develop some kind of malicious token/NFT

 I think there is no way to disprove a tx but maybe this feature could be add and the moment you choose no the feature will burn the tokens


[07/31/2022 6:40 AM] koutelier#0000

[07/31/2022 7:22 AM] odiseus_me#0000

(re @koutelier : *I think there is no way to disprove a tx but maybe this feature could be add and the moment you choose no the feature will burn the tokens*) 
 
 something tells me that there could be utility in such a feature. maybe worth bringing it up in the ergo platform TG?


[07/31/2022 7:28 AM] koutelier#0000
even if it was possible maybe this would cause more problems? miner will have to wait for the user to approve or disapprove a tx . this would bring a lot of issues. maybe a feature that like i said could be more "useful" but in the end point the tokens will be in your wallet and then they will be burned


[07/31/2022 11:49 AM] cafebedouin#0000
It's solving a problem that isn't. If you receive some token you don't want, you can burn it or send it to some random address. Even banks don't operate on a restricted deposit basis.

Hey there @nemo429, I'm not sure if you would find this useful, but I thought I might mention in in case it was. From the README:

"Outserv enables you to run production grade GraphQL Search APIs over any blockchain data 10x faster than existing mechanisms.

Outserv is the only system which combines the power of a search engine, a cache engine and a GraphQL layer, thus replacing three different systems in production."

Mosaik is a definition how a dapp can describe a UI, and this UI is targeted to wallet applications (the defined UI elements are for amount input, wallet address selection etc). So the concept is universally useable, but the reference implementation is for Java/Kotlin on dApp side, and Kotlin/Compose on wallet side. Currently doing a JS implementation as well, but not for wallet integration but as a standalone website interacting with browser wallets. If you are the first one on another tech stack, you need to implement the stuff. I myself still have to do it for iOS

(re @Marcus : *Nautilus has the option to create/restore wallet using ledger.. IS that fully supported now? Thought it was awaiting something before it can be used?*) 
 
 It's been available for a couple of months now.
BUT you need to sideload the ledger app onto a Nano S (not X, not s+).

The app is under review by LedgerHQ and when approved will be available through ledger live

Hey @MrNautilus! Just a heads up from last time when I couldn't send transactions via ledger because the wallet picked the wrong boxes - I listed a few nfts on Skyharbor, worked like a charm. They were all held in one box with 0.001 ERG and I had ERG in a different box. Then after listing 5 of the 13 I'm getting the too many tokens error on Skyharbor (dev tools, console log) and nothing on the wallet per se.


[08/09/2022 6:25 AM] eutxopool#0000
Now I have less than 10 tokens in my wallet and I still have the too many tokens error.

 We had a bug exactly like this one with older versions of ledger app (the limit was actually 6, if I remember well)


[08/09/2022 1:33 PM] nemo429#0000
btw, one of the motivations to write this lib FLET, was to handle ledger change on a way that drastically reduces issues with token limit. With ledger you will have one change box per distinct token

Question. When the app launches through Ledger Live will nano X have the same 10 token limitation?

Scenario: I send myself 20 tokens to nano s...which means nano s won't be able to handle it.

I then recover the same seed on Nano X. Can I then send the 20 tokens?

Asking as I use the sideloaded s apication today and I forgot and sent myself 10 differen tokens (lucky i didn't send 11!!). If I would be able to retrieve these eventually through an X it's ok. But if there was never a way to recover them that's a problem...

hello captain, opened https://github.com/capt-nemo429/nautilus-wallet/issues/35 on the nautilus repo describing how ErgoPay support in Nautilus could be done. Would be great to have it so that Mosaik apps on the web can use Nautilus to sign transactions, as well as all dApps would only need to implement ErgoPay to target all platforms. Thank you for your time. 🙂

[08/19/2022 7:26 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @anon1111 : *0-Day exploit in chrome wallets?*) 
 
 What, exactly, are you concerned about? A spending passphrase is used to encrypt your seed. So, the obvious attack vector would be some sort of keylogging software and either some way to remotely do a transfer out of the wallet, or maybe try to reverse engineer the hashing function. But, maybe you're talking about something else?


[08/19/2022 7:37 PM] anon1111#0000
Right, I'm not concerned, but when I see a pinned post on the ergonauts about a 0-day exploit for ios and chrome extension wallets, I am just curious if you've looked into it and who you think could be vulnerable

(re @anon1111 : *if it is, then what is your assessment?*) 
 
 I'm more of a power user, not a dev. My opinion on the matter isn't worth anything. Hot, browser based wallets have a bigger attack surface, but I'd guess an attack would still be difficult and target specific wallets and chains. So, low probability it is a problem for Ergo. If concerned, use a Read-Only wallet like SafeW, the new Mosaik desktop interface, etc. and Ergo Mobile Wallet. Or use a cold wallet, where you have two devices, one offline.

Do you think could be possible to implement some kind of 2fa? So you could enter the authenticator code to verify when sending a transaction as an added layer of security


[08/20/2022 9:15 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *Do you think could be possible to implement some kind of 2fa? So you could enter the authenticator code to verify when sending a transaction as an added layer of security*) 
 
 The average person is more likely to lose their 2FA seed though...


[08/20/2022 9:16 PM] cafebedouin#0000
But as a encryptibg password + 2FA that might be good.


[08/20/2022 9:16 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Yubikey integration is also a thought.


[08/21/2022 6:39 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
A bit nitpicky, but nautilus already is 2fa. The two factors are:
- access to the device it is set up on
- knowledge of the spending password

Cex etc don't have the former factor

[08/21/2022 2:46 PM] nitram147#5106
What would be a point of it? If private key (or mnemonic seed, don't know what's saved inside of nautilus but it doesn't matter) keep still encrypted only by password there would be no additional security from the attackers perspective - if I'm attacker and I know that you have Nautilus with money on it, I can just steal nautilus data and decrypt them later - for the decryption only password is required - so no additional security with using 2FA. Another scenario, I'm a random attacker and discover you went to a toilet and left your notebook unlocked - I don't know you neither I know your password, so password is more than enough to stop me from spending it directly from nautilus and also from stealing the data and decrypting them later.


[08/21/2022 2:47 PM] nitram147#5106
If you know and know my passwords, than if I want to stop you from using my nautilus I will just set a password that you don't know - as simple as that.


[08/21/2022 2:48 PM] nitram147#5106
There's no way how encrypt the private key by both password and 2fa, because the encryption key need to stay the same.


[08/21/2022 2:48 PM] nitram147#5106
(2FA are mostly challenge-response protocol, or some time based running-code protocols)


[08/21/2022 4:30 PM] NoahErgo#0000
(re  : *<nitram147> (2FA are mostly challenge-response protocol, or some time based running-code protocols)*) 
 
 My thinking was that recently there were macos hacks where one could gain remote access and complete control of a persons computer. If they have managed to acquired your spending password maybe the 2fa would act as a last resort. But maybe im misunderstanding too


[08/21/2022 8:48 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re  : *<nitram147> There's no way how encrypt the private key by both password and 2fa, because the encryption key need to stay the same.*) 
 
 To illustrate, I use Keepass. Keepass has an option to have a master password and a keyfile, which are both used to encrypt the Keepass database. One way of thinking of it, is that you need the database and the password in order to access the password list. But, another way to think of it is that there are now two things to possess to access the database, and it makes certain kinds of attacks much more difficult, say a program that includes a keylogger. If I am smart about it, such as keep the key file on a usb drive and the encrypted database on a cloud server, I have an additional layer of protection - because you either need to know or have possession of the key, the database and the password. https://keepass.info/help/base/keys.html#keyfiles


[08/21/2022 8:49 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Also, no reason the "key" couldn't be a yubikey.


[08/21/2022 8:51 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Keepass also has a range of other options, such as HOTP, as plugin options. These could also be adapted and used in a cryptowallet the same as they are used for a password manager.


[08/21/2022 8:51 PM] cafebedouin#0000
https://keepass.info/plugins.html


[08/21/2022 10:40 PM] nitram147#5106
If somebody has access to your computer, he can dump the encrypted database from nautilus and use spending password to decrypt it - so 2FA won't help


[08/21/2022 10:40 PM] nitram147#5106
Any OTP are literally one-time-passwords - they can be used in combination with spending password to encrypt the database


[08/21/2022 10:42 PM] nitram147#5106
They can be used only on frontend to now allow nautilus UI user to spend fund even when he knows spending password, but anybody with access to computer can just avoid using the UI and dump the database for which spending password is the encryption/decryption key - so nothing achieved other than a bit of "protection" from not technically skilled attacker for example an family member


[08/21/2022 10:43 PM] nitram147#5106
*not allow


[08/21/2022 10:45 PM] nitram147#5106
If somebody has the ability to install a keylogger on your machine he has also the ability to dump the database... If you want to protect from family members who could know your password because you left it on some notes paper than just don't do it and setup a spending password which is not similar to your another passwords which they could know


[08/21/2022 10:49 PM] nitram147#5106
Using additional keyfile could be helpful in the case of keylogger, but the attacker can always wait until the time comes and you send some transaction while his software is running in the background thus stealing the keyfile also - yes the attacker need special software, but it's the same in case of keylogger attack (for remote attacker). Using keyfile could be helpful against family member attacker who is able to install keylogger but is not able to program malware which will steal your keyfile.


[08/21/2022 11:18 PM] cafebedouin#0000

 Securty is layers. If they have physical access to the machine and you can sign transactions, then anything is possible. The nice thing about an optional keyfile is adding that kind of functionality is a bit of a bother and the number of people that would set-up a keyfile is low. So, no real incentive to make malware that looks for it, just as there is little incentive for a browser wallet creator to implement it.


[08/22/2022 1:06 AM] capt_nemo#3204
I agree with @nitram147 conventional 2FA protocols will only introduce a false sense of security.


[08/22/2022 1:08 AM] capt_nemo#3204
Maybe the best way to go ATM is using @MrStahlfelge's Ergo Wallet to sign transactions, just like SAFEW does


[08/22/2022 1:11 AM] capt_nemo#3204
A specific 2FA auth is also possible, A mobile 2FA app can hold half of the decryption key and send it to the wallet when the user authorizes


[08/22/2022 1:12 AM] dadreboi#0000
(re  : *<capt_nemo> I agree with @nitram147 conventional 2FA protocols will only introduce a false sense of security.*) 
 
 I def could see people being more relaxed with their keys if they think 2FA is protecting them. We see it at work with low effort passwords and sticky notes when they know they have 2FA. Also, all the big talking heads love to consider their issues over with by 2FAing everything. Agree it brings a false sense of security along with the added layer of protection - qx()

 validate who exactly sir ? there is ergoauth

if this is what you mean

I couldn't find the signMessage function on the object.  Any insight would be great.

(re  : *<TJ Sherrill> I couldn't find the signMessage function on the object.  Any insight would be great.*) 
 
 if i understand right you want to verify that the user address is his and not someone else ? (added read only address for example)


[08/22/2022 8:43 PM] TJ Sherrill#8403
In my use case I can have the user connect Nautilus but then all I really end up with is their wallet address.  This is not enough to authenticate in web2.  Yep thats correct

(re  : *<TJ Sherrill> In my use case I can have the user connect Nautilus but then all I really end up with is their wallet address.  This is not enough to authenticate in web2.  Yep thats correct*) 
 
 `const wasm = await import("ergo-lib-wasm-browser");
const address = await ergo.get_change_address();
const message = crypto.randomUUID();
const response = await ergo.auth(address, message);
const verified = wasm.verify_signature(
  wasm.Address.from_mainnet_str(address),
  Buffer.from(response.signedMessage, "utf-8"),
  Buffer.from(response.proof, "hex")
);`


[08/22/2022 8:43 PM] koutelier#0000
but you need to set up a database for the ergoauth probably


[08/22/2022 8:44 PM] TJ Sherrill#8403
ahh ok, so I need to layer in ergo-lib-wasm-browser and then I can do those things

[08/22/2022 8:48 PM] capt_nemo#3204
For authentication you should call `ergo.auth(address: string, message: string)`, then you can use sigma-rust's `verify_signature` to verify if the proof is valid


[08/22/2022 8:49 PM] capt_nemo#3204
ergo.auth() will return a string following this pattern: "originalMessage;origin;timestamp;randomBytes"


[08/22/2022 8:50 PM] capt_nemo#3204
This returned srting should be verified with `verify_signature`


[08/22/2022 8:50 PM] TJ Sherrill#8403
ok

Feature Request: Would like to chose which address I'm taking funds from. I tried using safew tx builder but that uses boxes (doesn't show address the box sits in).
E.g. I have an address with 50 unspent boxes, i want to consolidate those 50 unspent boxes to the SAME address.

Possible??


[08/23/2022 11:37 AM] Flying Pig#0000
Correction: Safew shows the address, but takes ages to load and review each box.


[08/23/2022 1:05 PM] haileypdll#3353
In Safew, did you tried the normal send feature, selecting only that address, and using the send all checkbox ?

you can also use ergo wallet app on ios, android or desktop providing this feature.

(re  : *<MrStahlfelge> you can also use ergo wallet app on ios, android or desktop providing this feature.*) 
 
 I'm using Ledger so can't use mobile wallet.

I wasn't aware of the send all and ability to select addresses I'm safew! Let me try later.

I normally use nautilus and not too familiar with safew.

 Oh. I meant sideloading it, I sideloaded it using virtual box.

I'm using it on Nautilus in windows.

I'm not a Linux guy :). Only use it when there's no other way (like the initial ledger app)


[08/23/2022 4:59 PM] J - The Ergod#0000
Hey Guys, as an effort to get the word out on Ergo, Andy and I discussed a community driven effort promoted by Ergo for an 'Discover Ergo Day'. The goal would be to get many genuine tweets on this day and hopefully start a snowball effect to bring new members onto the community. We do not want to be 'shilly', so the prompt would be something like 'What are your favorite things about Ergo? or 'What brought you to Ergo?'. 

We also want to get a pool of funds for the top 10 tweets. If you guys are willing to put some into the fund please let me know. 

It will be crucial for all projects on Ergo to participate so I ask that you guys get a tweet or a couple ready for the day. 

It will happen September 15th, a few days before the estimated ETH merge. The hashtag we will use is #DiscoverErgo (tg://search_hashtag?hashtag=DiscoverErgo) although i suggest to also add $ERG which is the classic one used. There will be more information coming as we need to make everyone in the community aware that it is coming! 

Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions 🙂 @nemo429

@koutelier and @capt_nemo one quick question: where are you getting the ergo object?  
`const address = await ergo.get_change_address();`

I was able to get the wasm imported but I don't have the ergo object anywhere


[08/24/2022 12:08 AM] Julizzle#5827
Thanks for the update


[08/24/2022 12:09 AM] capt_nemo#3204
Nautilus extension will automatically inject `ergoConnector` and `ergo` objects in your app context

Initially only `ergoConnector`, so you can call `ergoConnector.nautilus.connect()` and, if the user accepts, the `ergo` object will be injected

@koutelier I have a follow up if you have a moment: I have all this working and I get the response and verified returns true if I plug in my pw in the dialog.  I have a backend and a DB all rolled out too.  My question is: is there any way to send all this to my backend and validate it? By validate I mean make sure it all checks out?


[08/24/2022 10:35 PM] koutelier#5178
@capt_nemo can answer that i don't really know  hehe sorry mate


[08/24/2022 10:36 PM] TJ Sherrill#8403
All good, thanks.  It likely depends on my backend language.  If I packed up the response and sent it to a backend url that ran the ergo-lib-wasm-browser then I could confirm it there.


[08/24/2022 11:29 PM] capt_nemo#3204
All nautilus interactions should be made from the front end, but yes you can get nautilus responses and send it to backend in order to validate it


[08/25/2022 12:29 AM] TJ Sherrill#8403
That totally makes sense.  The backend would be the wasm call or something else to confirm the data.

You need to run few commands on the terminal to see if the devices shows there as well

(re @koutelier : *The best thing would be using wsl on widows. But I find it extremely hardly to mount a usb there on windows 11*) 
 
 Okay so install is looking good. What works, on an M1 Mac, is to use UTM to mount an x86 linux iso in emulation mode instead of using the native architecture iso. It took fucking ages to install and it is really slow but it works for now (knock on wood)


[08/30/2022 11:41 AM] eutxopool#0000

I ran the nautilus repository through Snyk to measure its vulnerabilities against known or proof-of-concept exploitation.

The only 'vulnerability' it discovered, was this improper input validation - which might just be the way dapp connectors work - but, I wanted to bring this here and share it in case it could be helpful.

 Wow, thanks for the report! Origin is checked, just not at this point, mostly for two reasons:

1. Any site should be able messages to Nautilus, otherwise there would no way to send a connection request, for example; and
2. It's not safe to handle user's data on content-script context, so the messages are passed straight to `background.js` and then checked, if not authorized it will return `{ code: APIErrorCode.Refused, info: "unauthorized" }` object.

Starting yesterday, I was no longer able to send ERG using nautilus.  It would say the transaction was successful, but would never show up on Ergo Explorer ("Transaction with this ID was not found, or it has not entered Mempool yet)".   I thought maybe something was down on nautilus, so I installed the Ergo's official mobile wallet and tried to send my ERG with it instead.  However when I send ERG with the official mobile app I get a long error that includes words such as "Could not send transaction" "Error executing AP request" "Error 400" "Reason: Bad Request" "Detail: Malformed transaction"  "has too high cost".   I even tried to send to a different destination address, but still have the same problems with both wallets.  None of these issues started until yesterday. Any ideas???

 I'd guess it is the same problem as you had with the Ergo Mobile Wallet. You have too many boxes and need to reduce the size of the transaction by reducing the number of boxes involved in the transaction.


[08/31/2022 6:27 PM] cafebedouin#0000
That is, make the Erg value smaller for the transaction until it accepts it.


[08/31/2022 6:34 PM] liquid_phase#4605
couldn't they also just send all their erg to themselves to consolidate to one box?


[08/31/2022 6:41 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re  : *<liquid_phase> couldn't they also just send all their erg to themselves to consolidate to one box?*) 
 
 Based on the questions he has asked in the Ergo Mobile Wallet Telegram, there are a massive number of boxes involved from mining. Normally, you could just consolidate them all. If you have thousands, then there's an upper limit of some sort.


[08/31/2022 7:29 PM] IncrementalWisdom#6648
Wait, what?  What do you mean by boxes?  It's true that I am trying to send ERG from an address that I mine to - but what does that have to do with me being unable to send ERG from the address that I mine to?


[08/31/2022 7:37 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Every wallet is an amalgamation of 'unspent transaction boxes' (UTXO) which is the fundamental principle of accounting behind ergo. It means when I send you 5 erg, that 5 erg sits in its own box - the boxes consolidate under your wallet address. It is possible to have 1 address, with 100 erg, that exists in 1000 'boxes' because they were all received in 0.1 erg increments from mining payouts.

 Great explanation. Thanks!


[08/31/2022 7:49 PM] IncrementalWisdom#6648
@liquid_phase I tried your advice of sending half as much ERG as I planned (using nautilus) and it worked.  I had no clue that the amount of ERG I am trying to send would affect a transaction's ability to be successful.  I'm a little mind blown right now to be honest - because  I've been active in crypto for a couple of years now and never knew this was a thing.  Do you have any recommended readings or youtube links to help me understand this phenomenon better?


[08/31/2022 7:52 PM] IncrementalWisdom#6648
@liquid_phase As I try to think through this further, does this mean I should be mining to an exchange?  I hate the idea of this as it seems to be a little against the ethos of crypto, butttttttt?


[08/31/2022 7:58 PM] liquid_phase#4605
No, mining to an exchange is dangerous for the exchange and the network, and exchanges generally arent as quick to update their nodes and programming instances to network changes - not your keys, not your crypto


[08/31/2022 7:59 PM] liquid_phase#4605
This box thing is how BTC works. BTC is UTXO model. Ethereum is accounting model, which is different and more like a bank ledger.


[08/31/2022 8:00 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Ergo takes many things into consideration with its approach to network usability and scalability - and niche cases like miners taking small payouts in high frequency isn't the norm for them to consider in their development, and i doubt this will be a problem as much as ergo network difficulty increases and emissions play out


[08/31/2022 8:05 PM] liquid_phase#4605
What i suggest you do is set up a wallet that your mining profits go into, and make a best practice for yourself every 2 to 4 weeks to consolidate your assets to another wallet, or send them all to yourself to put them from many boxes into one


[08/31/2022 8:06 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
(re  : *<IncrementalWisdom> @liquid_phase As I try to think through this further, does this mean I should be mining to an exchange?  I hate the idea of this as it seems to be a little against the ethos of crypto, butttttttt?*) 
 
 It’s fine to mine as you are. Just be sure to send your erg to yourself every so often to consolidate those boxes. It’s like exchanging 20 1$ bills for a single 20$ bill.

I think there are even dev projects being setup so that you can send via webhooks (ka-ching bot), so soon it will be as simple to automate things like consolidating. right now, it's early for ergo.


[08/31/2022 8:07 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Also do yourself a favor and set your miner payout higher. There’s no reason to get .1 erg mined every few hours vs. 1 erg a day instead.


[08/31/2022 8:08 PM] liquid_phase#4605
If you took 50 thousand 1 dollar bills to pay a fine, they would probably not accept it because of the human hours required to count that much. the concept here is similar, but with blockchain congestion instead of human time.

Hello. I'm working on some content about Babel Fees and I'd like to include some info about where Nautilus is implementing them. Can someone please point me to a good article or blog post... or just update me here? Thanks.

 Hey! I’m afraid we don’t have any writing on it yet. Full babel fees support is already added to nautilus and under testnet testing. 

Some issues popped up with contract but it’s already addressed, now we have two proposed versions of the contract with a fix, so we are trying to figure out which one is more suitable.


[09/02/2022 6:30 PM] jameskever#0000
Thanks. I can work with that.

How do I get the app? When i try to set up with Nautilus, it tells me I need to get ergo app but its nowhere to be found in my ledger dashboard.

(re @gaganwahh : *How do I get the app? When i try to set up with Nautilus, it tells me I need to get ergo app but its nowhere to be found in my ledger dashboard.*) 
 
 Nautilus works with dapps. So, you install it. Then, visit a website like spectrum.fi, and it will ask to connect your wallet.  Then, you can use the Spectrum DEX.


[09/03/2022 7:49 AM] cafebedouin#0000
Or, sigmausd.io


[09/03/2022 7:49 AM] cafebedouin#0000
Or, skyharbor.io


[09/03/2022 7:50 AM] cafebedouin#0000
Or, whatever other dapps you like in the ecosystem.

On github there is a repo with the ergo app for ledger. Anyone knows how to use it? It's secure?.     I don't know if the ergo app is avaliable only for the s model or it's not for any of them.

 the app is by ledger team, but it is not official release so using it is up to your own risk.

(re @koutelier : *Wdym sir?*) 
 
 Every so i often i get an email from ledger “market bites” discussing various current events in crypto.

If they run a piece on ergo when they announce the app could stir up some more interest in ergo.

They have 500k followers on twitter, so not a small network.

Yeah, tried multiple times last night and this morning, same error message.


[09/06/2022 12:54 PM] nemo429#0000
How many addresses do you have in your wallet?


[09/06/2022 1:01 PM] DG#0000

[09/06/2022 1:06 PM] nemo429#0000
Please, try removing your wallet and restore it from mnemonic again. Maybe some db corruption issue


[09/06/2022 1:07 PM] DG#0000
Okay will do. Is there a place to just confirm my seed phrase in the settings somewhere? I have it written down I believe but I want to confirm it’s definitely for Nautilus


[09/06/2022 1:08 PM] DG#0000
Could it also be that my ledger wasn’t plugged in actually? As the error message refers to witnesses to perform proof? I can’t remember if my ledger was ever linked, sorry.


[09/06/2022 1:08 PM] nemo429#0000
You can try restoring it without removing your wallet, if the mnemonic is wrong a validation message will appear


[09/06/2022 1:10 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @DG : *Could it also be that my ledger wasn’t plugged in actually? As the error message refers to witnesses to perform proof? I can’t remember if my ledger was ever linked, sorry.*) 
 
 Hmm, it show up as a ledger wallet or as a default one?


[09/06/2022 1:10 PM] DG#0000
Has the word ‘standard’ at the top so I’m assuming default then?


[09/06/2022 1:11 PM] nemo429#0000

(re @nemo429 : *You can try restoring it without removing your wallet, if the mnemonic is wrong a validation message will appear*) 
 
 I’ll try this then thank you. I believe it will be the Yoroi seed phrase as that’s the last wallet I used before this and imported it to Nault

(re @DG : *I’ll try this then thank you. I believe it will be the Yoroi seed phrase as that’s the last wallet I used before this and imported it to Nault*)

[09/06/2022 1:12 PM] DG#0000
No, I moved from Yoroi to Nautilus

When Yoroi stopped working


[09/06/2022 1:13 PM] nemo429#0000
You can also try installing nautilus on another device and try to restore


[09/06/2022 1:22 PM] DG#0000

 The funds arrived, thanks again. 


I’ll provide some further info to help diagnose the issue (please ignore some info if it’s not of any use to you) 

Laptop I saw the error on: 
MacOS Big Sur Version 11.6
Google Chrome version 105.0.5195.102
Nautilus Wallet version v0.5.1


Laptop the issue was no longer present: 
Windows 10
Google Chrome version 104.0.5112.102
Nautilus Wallet version v0.5.1

It could have just been a caching issue but hopefully some of this info is of some use to you for debugging.


[09/06/2022 1:42 PM] DG#0000
Both wallets have the same commit ID of: bc417b9

@koutelier I'm back from my holiday, I managed to sideload the Nano S Plus from an M1 Mac. My findings: I used UTM with 20.04 Ubuntu. At first I tried with a native ARM build and that route failed at the last step. In the end I used an emulated x86 architecture build which made it suuuuuuuuper slow to install and operate. Otherwise I followed your guide and it worked fine. Also important is to connect the Nano after the UTM mounted and to _always_ have it ask for approval, if you turn this off ("Allow UTM to have access to your USB device?" or something, it can be set to always allow) then no matter how you unlock the Nano UTM won't recognize it.

..sorry..., had a notification with ka-ching bot this early morning informing me of a little transaction sending about 2 erg somwhere.. try to explore with the id but dont know much about.. so i went to my wallet and then surprise, 99.99% of assets missing. wow! tried first to restore, same thing.

 If assets suddenly go missing, Nautilus isn't your problem. The problem is someone has your seed.


[09/10/2022 2:17 PM] Eric#0000
If such case hapened (dont think but...) how trace transactions?

 Isn’t possible to send transactions  using nautilus without explicitly typing your spending password


[09/10/2022 2:18 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @Eric : *If such case hapened (dont think but...) how trace transactions?*) 
 
 Ground truth for what's in your wallet is by going to your address in explorer.


[09/10/2022 2:19 PM] cafebedouin#0000
In Nautilus, click receive, then click on the address of interest. It launches explorer for you.


[09/10/2022 2:20 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @nemo429 : *Isn’t possible to send transactions  using nautilus without explicitly typing your spending password*) 
 
 No, it isn't. It always needs a spending password. So, if someone has access to your machine and password, they could use it. But, anyone with your seed could restore the wallet anywhere and set a new password. The seed is what is most important.


[09/10/2022 2:22 PM] Eric#0000
it says 0 transactions, and 0 balance ! that what is incomprehensive.


[09/10/2022 2:27 PM] icelandgrandpa#0000
What explorer showing?


[09/10/2022 2:30 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @Eric : *it says 0 transactions, and 0 balance ! that what is incomprehensive.*) 
 
 Then, chances are you are clicking on an address that has never been used but is derived from your main one. Nautilus shows the list of addresses, click on one that has a balance not equal to zero. If there aren't any, then try clicking them all and seeing if any have transactions.


[09/10/2022 2:34 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @nemo429 : *Isn’t possible to send transactions  using nautilus without explicitly typing your spending password*) 
 
 Sorry. I was skimming and thought it was Eric asking if Nautilus could be used without the password. My explaining wallets to you is a bit like if I were trying to explain physics to Einstein.


[09/10/2022 2:44 PM] Kai#0000

(re @Eric : *Hello. i'm back with a few infos i got with getblok.io pool. Who can i talk with about it please,*) 
 
 If its mining with getblok, you might want to try their channel.


[09/10/2022 4:21 PM] Eric#0000
i talked to them, its not on their end; been regularly paid. it's still about transactions i didn't initiate. would really appriciate yr patience about sorting out this issue. Thanks


[09/10/2022 4:25 PM] cafebedouin#0000
If transactions have been paid, they should appear on the block chain. Your last comment said that there were no transactions. So, the first step is: do you have the right address?


[09/10/2022 4:26 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Your mining address is in your mining configuration file.


[09/10/2022 4:30 PM] Eric#0000
sorry if i messed precedently. i received every payments on my wallet. had not any problem with that. the fact is that there is a transaction (of about 99% of my assets erg and ergopad) which has been sent from my default address on nautilus to an unknow one (may be a liquidity pool.., dont know) but never did it. my actual balance (on default address) showing 0.099 erg and 0.16 ergopad. so thy're missing.


[09/10/2022 4:32 PM] cafebedouin#0000

 So, this can happen if you have the privacy feature on in Nautilus. So, we are at the going to receive and checking the address with assets step again.


[09/10/2022 4:33 PM] Eric#0000
i checked and no privacy mode on.


[09/10/2022 4:34 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Check the last transaction, on the address it was sent out of. Where was it sent to?


[09/10/2022 4:34 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Are there other transactions at that address?


[09/10/2022 4:35 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Do you recognize any of them?


[09/10/2022 4:37 PM] Eric#0000
1 transaction of 152ergo and 281 pads 09.0922 and 1 of 1.9 erg and 21 pads this early morning, both at same receiving address : 9fUWihK9GoSsqWoRioFT3ezXCHxKmfbiX44bRcUFfwx33mFPT6C


[09/10/2022 4:38 PM] Eric#0000
perfectly unknown address.


[09/10/2022 5:01 PM] cafebedouin#0000
I'm on mobile, which makes looking at explorer a bit of a PITA. But, it looks to me that you are talking about this transaction: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/addresses/9fUWihK9GoSsqWoRioFT3ezXCHxKmfbiX44bRcUFfwx33mFPT6C


[09/10/2022 5:02 PM] cafebedouin#0000
And it looks like a payment from getblok's Ergopad smartpool, to you.


[09/10/2022 5:05 PM] cafebedouin#0000
So, from getblok's perspective, everything is working as it should. But, if that's not your address, then you need to change your mining configuration address to one you own.


[09/10/2022 5:07 PM] Arohbe#0000
This just happened to someone else. Eric did you try to use some link to fix ergopad?

(re @Pulsarzz : *is it using the "official" instance?*) 
 
 Yup, and we have tree other fallback instances, if one fail, nautilus will choose one and try to resend the requests, so this version is way more fault tolerant

Is their a Limit to the number of Native Assets a single Wallet can hold?

For extreme purposes, let’s say 50 million native assets…

In this extreme scenario, would the querying of the wallet through the Explorer api be extremely slow?

 I can envision a setup by which multiple wallets are used in an application.

A square grid based on a given size points back to a unique Wallet address which then holds the native assets applicable to that given square grid.

Lots of detail… but goal is to make the data/application and economy as decentralized and L1 as possible

people really love brave but that company did shady stuff like replace search result links with their specific affiliate link version to get profits. When a company hides stuff like that and is unapologetic once they get caught, there's no telling what they're willing to do/hide until they're caught red handed. Not saying what they are doing/what's happening to nautilus is nefarious - just that I don't trust companies that ping pong between principles to whatever end serves them

[09/15/2022 12:27 AM] liquid_phase#4605
I believe there is a specific testnet build on nemo's github

Skyharbor is having issues with nautilus when using get_utxos, we think it’s because you guys use the public explorer and that’s down at the moment

Is there a way to take in a parameter to use our own explorer?

I found an issue yesterday and fixed it, but unfortunately not all explorer instances are updated to the patched version


[09/15/2022 7:57 PM] cryptoquokka#0000
It’s when we get the user’s NFT’s/Erg from their wallet


[09/15/2022 7:57 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @cryptoquokka : **) 
 
 Humm, what version of nautilus are you using?


[09/15/2022 7:57 PM] nemo429#0000
Latest version doesn’t use explorer API at all


[09/15/2022 7:57 PM] nemo429#0000
Only graphql


[09/15/2022 8:30 PM] cryptoquokka#0000
Using latest version


[09/15/2022 8:30 PM] cryptoquokka#0000

@MGpai I think the testnet build of this release will work for your testnet, you just need to go to settings and set your GraphQL server

 Ok, issue identified will push a fix in a few hours. Thanks for your report


[09/18/2022 4:56 AM] nemo429#0000
You can restore your mnemonic on mobile wallet to get unstuck.

This is happening because you have too many tokens in a box (shouldn’t be a problem), so my bet is if you send a transaction to yourself using mobile wallet it will split this box into smaller ones and then you will be able to use Nautilus again without needing to wait for a fix


[09/18/2022 5:17 AM] wewmonic demonic#3271
ive already tried using other wallets


[09/18/2022 5:18 AM] wewmonic demonic#3271

if I may ask


[09/18/2022 7:06 AM] cafebedouin#0000
(re  : *<wewmonic demonic> if I may ask*) 
 
 Nautilus is bridged by bots so Telegram and Discord channels can be joined. People on the other service appear as "bots". Capt said it was an easy fix that they would push in a few hours. Update probably fixed your problem.


[09/18/2022 7:17 AM] cafebedouin#0000
It's @ErgoTipperBot


[09/18/2022 7:18 AM] cafebedouin#0000
I believe @ergotip_bot is the old bot, but not sure.

 You need to reenter your mnemonics

Thanks


[09/18/2022 11:29 PM] T Diddy#6561
Can I switch between wallets on nautilus? I had a main wallet and I made a read only of the same wallet but now the main wallet is gone. I still have the seed and was going to delete the main wallet off the computer for security anyways but I’m just making sure nautilus automatically deleted that wallet or if my computer is just glitching.


[09/18/2022 11:43 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Yes, you can.


[09/18/2022 11:43 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Click the wallet name, then all wallets appear in a drop down list. Select the one you want.


[09/18/2022 11:44 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re  : *<T Diddy> Can I switch between wallets on nautilus? I had a main wallet and I made a read only of the same wallet but now the main wallet is gone.

 Above.


[09/18/2022 11:51 PM] T Diddy#6561
Yeah when I click that it opens the standard drop down list. So add new wallet, expand view, settings, about. If I click the name again it closes the list.


[09/18/2022 11:52 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re  : *<T Diddy> Yeah when I click that it opens the standard drop down list. So add new wallet, expand view, settings, about. If I click the name again it closes the list.*) 
 
 Yep, if you have multiple wallets the other wallets will be listed


[09/18/2022 11:52 PM] T Diddy#6561
But what I was stating is when I made the read only wallet it deleted the main wallet. Is that normal?


[09/18/2022 11:56 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re  : *<T Diddy> But what I was stating is when I made the read only wallet it deleted the main wallet. Is that normal?*) 
 
 Are they the same wallet?


[09/18/2022 11:57 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Ah yes, I see you said that.


[09/18/2022 11:57 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Yes, if you reinput a wallet, it replaces the existing one.


[09/18/2022 11:57 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Same on Ergo Mobile Wallet.

 Yeah, by height I guess, I’ll put alerts after tx history is done.

For now, Nautilus always tries to spend older boxes in order to avoid storage rent

I moved an issue from ergopad to nautilus to consolidate assets.  If this is added to nautilus features, that would be great, although if not we may try to handle this on ergopad.io but would love feedback for future considerations to better support others needs.

[09/20/2022 6:49 PM] JOFLITO#0000
(re @pheyyex : *Will check again*) 
 
 Check on Kucoin, it asks for like 80 confirmations iirc


[09/20/2022 6:49 PM] ibetuwill#0000
(re @C4lculista : *Check on Kucoin, it asks for like 80 confirmations iirc*) 
 
 80????


[09/20/2022 6:49 PM] koutelier#0000
If it’s not then contact KuCoin it’s a problem on their side


[09/20/2022 6:50 PM] koutelier#0000
(re @C4lculista : *Check on Kucoin, it asks for like 80 confirmations iirc*) 
 
 Are you positive about that ? I remember 10.


[09/20/2022 6:50 PM] koutelier#0000
Huobi was 80 but it was reduce to 25


[09/20/2022 6:50 PM] ibetuwill#0000
Holy f, it said 60 confirmations!

(re @pheyyex : *Will check again*) 
 
 So sir you need 60 confirmations


[09/20/2022 6:52 PM] ibetuwill#0000
(re @pheyyex : *Will check again*) 
 
 Your Ergs are safe, all you have to do is wait 60 confirmations.
It was 10 a week ago to deposit on Kucoin.


[09/20/2022 6:52 PM] koutelier#0000
Wtf


[09/20/2022 6:52 PM] koutelier#0000
Why 60 confirmations ?


[09/20/2022 6:52 PM] pheyyex#0000
(re @koutelier : *So sir you need 60 confirmations*) 
 
 It’s says 17


[09/20/2022 6:53 PM] koutelier#0000
@Armeanio can we do something about it . 60 confirmations are way too long I believe

(re @pheyyex : *It’s says 17*) 
 
 Yeah you need 43 more sir


[09/20/2022 6:53 PM] Armeanio#0000
in case massive hashrate jumps on

Got it


[09/20/2022 6:54 PM] Armeanio#0000

[09/20/2022 6:54 PM] JOFLITO#0000
(re @pheyyex : *It’s says 17*) 
 
 you have 17 confirmations, your erg will be available when you have 60 confirmations

[09/20/2022 6:57 PM] ibetuwill#0000
(re @pheyyex : *Unless I’m not understanding the core value of what Nautilus wallet stands for*) 
 
 It's a good wallet and open source. You can check the code


[09/20/2022 6:58 PM] ibetuwill#0000
(re @pheyyex : *But generally restrictions on one’s fund is not encouraging for the crypto space*) 
 
 It's restriction of exchange, not Nautilus


[09/20/2022 7:00 PM] JOFLITO#0000
(re @pheyyex : *But generally restrictions on one’s fund is not encouraging for the crypto space*) 
 
 nothing to do with Nautilus, that is up to the exchange, usually is a shorter time, but since we just had the ETH merge they are asking for more confirmations


[09/20/2022 7:07 PM] pheyyex#0000
(re @C4lculista : *you have 17 confirmations, your erg will be available when you have 60 confirmations*)

 yes


[09/21/2022 4:02 PM] JOFLITO#0000
but only from thay box


[09/21/2022 4:03 PM] JOFLITO#0000
each box (utxo) has its own timer


[09/21/2022 4:03 PM] CryptoizFuture#0000
we have the send all assets option right?


[09/21/2022 4:03 PM] CryptoizFuture#0000
like in cardano


[09/21/2022 4:03 PM] CryptoizFuture#0000
if we use that send all the utxos to one address i think it resets all ?

If someone sends you 11 tokens to a ledger wallet you're stuffed :).

 I bet dude but I've seen alot of people retort that it's on ledgers side of the court, I get it as a miner there's an hourly moan about the diff, they'll fade away and learn where and how the development went but as the ecosystem grows more will come in with "wen ledger" such is the nature of a growing ecosystem. Keep doing you majority of the community loves the dev team. As do I <3

(re  : *<Sultan> Does nautilus have support for doing taxes ? I extended my taxes last year and it’s due in a couple weeks*) 
 
 We have a toolkit you can use to export your transactions.   Can also correlate with the price at the time of the tx which is very helpful for taxes.   https://github.com/GetBlok-io/Getblok-Toolkit

Hi all.
I faced problem. 
Over 2 last days my wallet didn't loading....status "loading" and nothing else.
Is there any problem with connection in turkey? Or something else?

(re @samu4444 : *Anybody got it on the ledger x?*) 
 
 yeah, have had in on ledger since may. But you have to sideload it onto a nano s/s+. Doesn't work on ledger x until ledger approves it on their ledger live platform (in progress)


[10/05/2022 1:57 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Nautilus requires https://, but now I see that it doesn't makes sense for local infrastructure. Will change that on the next release. Thanks for your feedback

[10/06/2022 7:32 PM] Perotillo78#0000
(re  : *<essaias> Flux-erg token is what you want*) 
 
 How can i, for example, buy flux on binance and swap for erg on spectrum in thah way?


[10/06/2022 7:32 PM] cometeer#0000
It's much faster to buy ERG directly.


[10/06/2022 7:33 PM] essaias#5787
Currently ZelCore only. (Fusion App there)


[10/06/2022 7:34 PM] Perotillo78#0000
(re @cometeer : *It's much faster to buy ERG directly.*) 
 
 Erg cant be bought on binance


[10/06/2022 7:34 PM] cometeer#0000
But if you want to go your route. Buy Flux on the exchange, send it to your zelcore wallet. Use the "Fusion" feature to swap Flux for Flux-Erg (This is wrapped flux on Ergo chain). Then send Flux-Erg to your nautilus wallet address.


[10/06/2022 7:34 PM] Perotillo78#0000
(re @Perotillo78 : *Erg cant be bought on binance*) 
 
 Buying flux to swap for ergo would be a way


[10/06/2022 7:34 PM] essaias#5787
Yeah ERG on ramp options are limited,  yet.

 Mmm, thanks


[10/06/2022 7:35 PM] cometeer#0000
It took several hours for my flux-erg to arrive using the fusion feature, so not sure if its faster now.


[10/06/2022 7:37 PM] essaias#5787
Fusion does claiming sequentially. If you are already on chain (eg spectrum) it shall be faster.

 Yup! I’m working on it since may, iirc. Some infrastructure was needed to build it right, that’s why I needed to build the GraphQL server first. Infrastructure is done, next step will be to put everything together in the nautilus UI

@capt_nemo would you consider adding a field for custom explorer URL? I'd like to use my own explorer instead of the regular one. I added routes for the endpoints used in ergo explorer to sigmaexplorer so it should be drop in replacement.

 You could change the url in the source and compile yourself. That's what I did to use my own Explorer.

But I agree, it would be nice to have the option. Safew has this.


[10/10/2022 11:42 PM] FlyingPig_69#0000
But I wouldn't say it's top priority. 99.99% of users would never use that setting.

 I think so


[10/18/2022 2:01 PM] nemo429#0000
Can you share the steps on how to reproduce? I can jump into it in a couple hours


[10/18/2022 2:02 PM] cryptoquokka#0000
Wait no the person said its not the one being burned so its a diff nft. Maybe he just had too many NFTs in his boxes hmmm


[10/18/2022 2:02 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @cryptoquokka : *I think so*) 
 
 If a token is getting burned, that means that it is included as input but not as output, so probably get_utxos is working as expected


[10/18/2022 2:02 PM] cryptoquokka#0000
(re @nemo429 : *Can you share the steps on how to reproduce? I can jump into it in a couple hours*) 
 
 It was a user doing this and hes not technical so getting the steps might be impossible lol


[10/18/2022 2:03 PM] nemo429#0000
I’ll have a call now, you investigate in a couple hours and get back to you


[10/18/2022 2:03 PM] cryptoquokka#0000
tysm, if we find out whats wrong I'll contact you asap


[10/18/2022 2:13 PM] KrasaviceBlasen#0000
Hi


[10/18/2022 2:14 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @KrasaviceBlasen : *Hi*) 
 
 Hey!


[10/18/2022 2:16 PM] KrasaviceBlasen#0000
tbh I think we just need to change our function on sky harbor end. looking at our assumptions in our code I think we are assuming get_utxos(amount, id) would return boxes containing id until amount is met


[10/18/2022 2:17 PM] KrasaviceBlasen#0000
Not sure if its a result of the recent update, but it now seems that boxes which do not contain id will be returned as well. (i.e. it seems to just give back any boxes until amount is met)


[10/18/2022 2:19 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @KrasaviceBlasen : *tbh I think we just need to change our function on sky harbor end. looking at our assumptions in our code I think we are assuming get_utxos(amount, id) would return boxes containing id until amount is met*) 
 
 That’s true, Nautilus will (or at least should) select boxes until the amount is met


[10/18/2022 2:20 PM] KrasaviceBlasen#0000
(re @nemo429 : *That’s true, Nautilus will (or at least should) select boxes until the amount is met*) 
 
 Yeah the caveat of our assumption was that only boxes that contain that token would be returned


[10/18/2022 2:20 PM] KrasaviceBlasen#0000
Which was just something we could do for nfts since they only had 1 box always (for speed increase I believe)


[10/18/2022 2:20 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @KrasaviceBlasen : *Yeah the caveat of our assumption was that only boxes that contain that token would be returned*) 
 
 Not aways, lets imagine you need additional erg for fee, for example


[10/18/2022 2:21 PM] KrasaviceBlasen#0000
Yea, and then we had if not enough erg call for some erg


[10/18/2022 2:21 PM] KrasaviceBlasen#0000
checking not duplicate too probably


[10/18/2022 2:22 PM] nemo429#0000
Now you can call `get_utxos({nanoErgs: “10000”, tokens: [{tokenId: “t_id”, amount: “1”}]})`


[10/18/2022 2:22 PM] nemo429#0000
Get all needed boxes in one call, without duplications


[10/18/2022 2:26 PM] KrasaviceBlasen#0000
Yeah this is clearly nicer and works well (i.e it returns only useful boxes)


[10/18/2022 2:26 PM] KrasaviceBlasen#0000
But with old params sadly changed it to return some non-useful boxes I think


[10/18/2022 2:26 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @KrasaviceBlasen : *Yeah the caveat of our assumption was that only boxes that contain that token would be returned*) 
 
 Juts confirmed, it’s a but on my side. Will push a fix ASAP


[10/18/2022 2:27 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @KrasaviceBlasen : *But with old params sadly changed it to return some non-useful boxes I think*) 
 
 That’s true, just confirmed


[10/18/2022 2:27 PM] KrasaviceBlasen#0000
But we can change to new version. I like it better


[10/18/2022 2:28 PM] nemo429#0000

(re @KrasaviceBlasen : *Also what is returned when get_eutxos cant find the requested assets now? Still empty array?*) 
 
 Yup, empty array


[10/18/2022 3:31 PM] KrasaviceBlasen#0000
Seems to never return for me :/ maybe I am doing something wrong


[10/18/2022 3:40 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @KrasaviceBlasen : *Seems to never return for me :/ maybe I am doing something wrong*) 
 
 How are you calling get_utxos?


[10/18/2022 3:41 PM] nemo429#0000
I noticed that if we call get_utxos(“1”, “tokenId”) it will never resolve


[10/18/2022 3:46 PM] KrasaviceBlasen#0000
get_utxos({nanoErgs: "10000000000"})


[10/18/2022 3:47 PM] KrasaviceBlasen#0000
something too big


[10/18/2022 3:48 PM] nemo429#0000
Gotcha, investigating


[10/18/2022 4:08 PM] nemo429#0000
@KrasaviceBlasen check your DM on discord sir, pushed a custom build to fix that


[10/18/2022 4:27 PM] cryptoquokka#0000
Is there a javascript function to check the version of the wallet? something like wallet.getDetails()? Because if so we're going to be asking users to update if they don't have the latest version


[10/18/2022 4:32 PM] nemo429#0000
Unfortunately not, but I did a fix for current approach, can you test?


[10/18/2022 4:41 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @cryptoquokka : *Is there a javascript function to check the version of the wallet? something like wallet.getDetails()? Because if so we're going to be asking users to update if they don't have the latest version*) 
 
 But it’s something really good to have


[10/18/2022 4:42 PM] cryptoquokka#0000
Yeah, will test out thanks! Yeah a version check would be nice so we can let out users know to update nautilus or have specific functions for each version

 Hey nemo forgive the basic question but is it safe to type my seed into my browser while using nautilus? Meaning I accidentally just loaded up my main wallet and am. Concerned that I just exposed my entire main wallet to the Internet by loading it up in nautilus chrome browser, or am I safe since the browser extension is... Safe?


[10/20/2022 10:26 PM] Saluu95#0000

[10/20/2022 10:28 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
Nautilus itself is safe, but if your PC is infected then always a possibility of an attack, run some antivirus checks and if nervous make a new wallet and send to that i guess


[10/20/2022 11:00 PM] Saluu95#0000

 If you're looking for the safety of a cold wallet, consider the cold wallet feature ergo mobile wallet offers. I prefer that over my ledger honestly.

 I sign transactions using a note 2. Nothing is too old. May require installing another operating system like LineageOS though, which probably sounds like a PITA, if it is something you don't do regularly.

sorry if these are frequent topics, but could there be a "consolidate utxos" button, and maybe even a wallet setting to run it whenever a utxo is 3.99 years old or whatever? maybe a smart contract the user signs somehow

 You can fetch the user’s inputs by calling ``ergo.get_utxos()``

so I import the library into my main js file, compile assets, and then add a form input with an on click method of ```ergo.get_utxos()``` and in theory nautilus should pop up on the submittal ?

 Exactly, it will pop up when you call ergo.sign_tx()

 Hi! I’m glad you are using Fleet for your projects 🙂

Fleet uses Buffer under the hood, it’s a very convenient way to work with bytes on JavaScript, the problem is that some bundling tools doesn’t automatically add support for it by default, what’s the case for webpack, for example.

On Nautilus I solve this by telling webpack to include Buffer’s code, see: https://github.com/capt-nemo429/nautilus-wallet/blob/master/vue.config.js#L36

Hi guys, I have a quick question about the wallet :) 
Is it necessary/recommended to have a crypto dedicated laptop, with only the wallet installed? I'm a bit nervous for any virussen or smt on my regular laptop if I also have my wallet installed there. I'm looking to connect a ledger to the wallet though. Is that enough security, or better to buy a new laptop entirely?

 Depends on your threat profile and what you use it for. Safest, probably, is to move it to a paper wallet and keep that paper wallet in a safety deposit box. But, you cannot do anything with a paper wallet until you import it into another wallet. Another move would be to use Nautilus with Ledger, when that becomes available. Another would be to use a Ergo Mobile Wallet (Terminus) and use a second, off-line phone to sign transactions. You could also use SAFEW with a hot mobile wallet that has the keys.


[11/03/2022 11:08 PM] cafebedouin#0000
So, answer depends on you. Android is probably more secure than Windows and a Chrome extension. But, how much security do you need? Do you have other people using your laptop? In your living space? How do you use cryptocurrencies? Etc.


[11/03/2022 11:08 PM] cafebedouin#0000

 It's a shared laptop between me and my gf. How much security i need I dont know honestly. It's only meant for storing, so as safe as possible without having to worry about it. I'm mainly worried about possible viruses, and thus compromising the crypto I hold.

 If you are worried about the machine, then either Ledger/Nautilus or SAFEW/Ergo Mobile Wallet (Terminus Wallet) is the way to go. Ledger isn't official yet.

 So having a cold storage function like ego mobile or a ledger would suffice, no seperate laptop necessary? Thanks for your replies :)

[11/04/2022 8:36 AM] Saluu95#0000
Question, using ledger would be safer than nautilus right? Cause I can still get keylogged while typing in my seed correct?


[11/04/2022 8:37 AM] Saluu95#0000
Also using ergo mobile wallet is arguably safer than a browser extension but then there's the risk of the phone itself getting stolen


[11/04/2022 8:37 AM] Saluu95#0000
Man I can't wait for ledger


[11/04/2022 9:06 AM] Pulsarz#9208
you would use ledger in combination with nautilus, just like you still use metamask usually with a ledger


[11/04/2022 9:30 AM] FlyingPig_69#0000
If you're happy sideloading the ergo ledger app you can use it today. I've had it since may and it's working great.

The main challenge i believe is that the ledger memory is too small!
If you get more than 10 tokens in a box it won't send. And it also doesn't display the recipient address on the ledger displays itself.

Not a problem for nano x / s+ but I believe ledger stipulates that apps must support all ledgers.

And S has just a tiny amount of ram.....

If only they could discontinue the S....


[11/04/2022 9:37 AM] Pulsarz#9208
the funny thing is when you send something and it uses a box with 5 tokens and a box with 6 tokens combined it fails aswell


[11/04/2022 9:37 AM] Pulsarz#9208
been there... it's not fun.


[11/04/2022 9:37 AM] Pulsarz#9208
since you can't manually select what boxes to use


[11/04/2022 9:38 AM] Pulsarz#9208
would be a fun developer feature to let the user select what input boxes to use, but low priority


[11/04/2022 9:38 AM] FlyingPig_69#0000
(re  : *<Pulsarz> since you can't manually select what boxes to use*) 
 
 You could use safew and select boxes...
Not user friendly but it would work :)


[11/04/2022 9:38 AM] Pulsarz#9208
havent used safew since the first few weeks it existed tbh..


[11/04/2022 9:39 AM] Pulsarz#9208
I have an S right now and have no reason to upgrade, but I would be more then happy to upgrade if needed.

(re  : *<Pulsarz> havent used safew since the first few weeks it existed tbh..*) 
 
 The tx builder allows you to select specific boxes...

Safew is for advanced users. It's ugly but serves a purpose.

Nautilus is clean and easy to use.


[11/04/2022 3:58 PM] liquid_phase#4605
Safew has a tx builder where you can fill in registers with arbitrary data manually without a command line?


[11/04/2022 4:21 PM] FlyingPig_69#0000
(re  : *<liquid_phase> Safew has a tx builder where you can fill in registers with arbitrary data manually without a command line?*) 
 
 Yup....I used it to manually create a refund tx for a spectrum swap that failed and where the refund button didn't work (refund option is broken for ergopay on the Dex).

So I created then tx manually. Cpying the box register from explorer and using the tx builder to create and then sign using ergopay.

 Yeah, you are right, that’s already done, the algorithm will randomly choose an instance and retry sending the request, up to tree times. 

The problem is that we have two problematic, instances out of four, official one is randomly failing and getblock’s is completely down.

I’ll try to find time today to replace GetBlock’s instance by Aneta’s one, which will help a lot.


[11/10/2022 12:51 PM] nemo429#0000
So, if you put a healthy instance as default you'll don't need retries and everything will go well

 Provider makes a box, easiest method is here: https://tokenjay.app/app/#purchases


[11/11/2022 11:59 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Part of the transaction does a swap with that box when doing a transaction to cover the miner fee.


[11/12/2022 12:00 AM] cafebedouin#0000
Tokenjay is for non-technical. Since you do your own transactions, you may be able to do it yourself.


[11/12/2022 12:00 AM] cafebedouin#0000
But, you can see how it works and maybe build transactions of that example.


[11/12/2022 12:07 AM] FlyingPig_69#0000
So I can build a box and decide on the fee.

When someone wants to pay using a token how does it determine which box to use? Cheapest fee? 

Is there documentation on how this works somewhere? 
How the box is set up and how it's decided which box to use.

 It can vary from implementation from implementation, on Nautilus it will always try to choose the cheapest rate

 I´m having problems while restoring my wallet in Brave Browser. Everything was fine until the last browser update, which reset my nautilus wallet. Faced with this situation, I chose the option to recover the wallet using my seed phrase and I was surprised to have my balance at zero. Additionally, my wallet address changed. Luckily, I checked the Ergo browser to see that my funds are still there, but unfortunately I am not able to access them. What can this problem be due to?

Faced with this situation, I chose the option to recover the wallet using my seed phrase and I was surprised to have my balance at zero. Additionally, my wallet address changed. Luckily, I checked the Ergo browser to see that my funds are still there, but unfortunately I am not able to access them. What can this problem be due to?*) 
 
 I'd say the most likely problem is you input the seed incorrectly. I'd try doing it again.


[11/14/2022 12:36 PM] Pablo#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *I'd say the most likely problem is you input the seed incorrectly. I'd try doing it again.*) 
 
 I did it four times already


[11/14/2022 12:38 PM] cafebedouin#0000
If you tried multiple times, using the seed you copied, then it suggests you might not have originally written it correctly.


[11/14/2022 12:38 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Strange that an update would effect your wallet and reset it.


[11/14/2022 12:39 PM] cafebedouin#0000
So, when you say Ergo Browser, you are checking the Explorer, right?


[11/14/2022 12:40 PM] Pablo#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *So, when you say Ergo Browser, you are checking the Explorer, right?*) 
 
 yes


[11/14/2022 12:40 PM] cafebedouin#0000
So, it exists on the block chain. The problem is your seed isn't correct.


[11/14/2022 12:43 PM] Pablo#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *If you tried multiple times, using the seed you copied, then it suggests you might not have originally written it correctly.*) 
 
 I really doubt it. This is not my first rodeo. I had this seed copied in a password manager, like all my other wallets which never gave me trouble. Nautilus also asks for spending password and wallet name, and accepted them both


[11/14/2022 12:45 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @Pablo : *I really doubt it. This is not my first rodeo. I had this seed copied in a password manager, like all my other wallets which never gave me trouble. Nautilus also asks for spending password and wallet name, and accepted them both*) 
 
 Well, anytime you restore a wallet, you will give it a name, and the password encrypts the seed and is used for signing transactions. So, accepting the wallet name and password is something that will happen. The fact the main address changed tells you the seed is different.


[11/14/2022 12:46 PM] cafebedouin#0000
And the seed is the key that allows you to access the on chain funds, through a wallet like Nautilus.


[11/14/2022 12:47 PM] Pablo#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *Well, anytime you restore a wallet, you will give it a name, and the password encrypts the seed and is used for signing transactions. So, accepting the wallet name and password is something that will happen. The fact the main address changed tells you the seed is different.*) 
 
 Like i told you, I made a copy-paste of the seed


[11/14/2022 12:47 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Did you copy paste seed into the password manager or type it?


[11/14/2022 12:47 PM] Pablo#0000
Copy paste


[11/14/2022 12:47 PM] Pablo#0000
It´s my only Ergo address


[11/14/2022 12:47 PM] cafebedouin#0000
And you are trying to copy paste for restore?


[11/14/2022 12:48 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Might try seeing if you get the same result with Ergo Mobile Wallet.


[11/14/2022 12:48 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Or if there is a space at the end or something.


[11/14/2022 12:49 PM] Pablo#0000
I tryed with Terminus and got the same result


[11/14/2022 12:49 PM] Pablo#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *Or if there is a space at the end or something.*) 
 
 I´m going to double check this


[11/14/2022 12:49 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Yeah, then there is something funky with your seed.


[11/14/2022 12:50 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Maybe copy and paste added something, so just do it manually.


[11/14/2022 12:54 PM] Pablo#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *Maybe copy and paste added something, so just do it manually.*) 
 
 I just did it manually, same outcome... 🤷‍♂️ Can it be something in the spending password or wallet name? It should´t but I´m desperate


[11/14/2022 1:01 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @Pablo : *I just did it manually, same outcome... 🤷‍♂️ Can it be something in the spending password or wallet name? It should´t but I´m desperate*) 
 
 It's the seed. Particularly if you are having problems in a different wallet. There was an issue with wallet generation going cross wallet, that effected a few wallets. But if you generated this seed and successfully used this in Nautilus in the past, then it should not be the issue here.


[11/14/2022 1:02 PM] cafebedouin#0000
I'm out of ideas. We can ask @nemo429, the main wallet developer, if there is something I have missed.

 Did you create the wallet originally on a node or a very old version of nautilus?

You may need to add the seed, and then go to derive 10-50 more addresses under the primary one for it to show up

 I don´t understand what to do.  I just checked all the words of my seed and they are well writen... Like I said before, I copied and pasted the seed to my password manager, like i do with my other 10 wallets... no room of failure there.


[11/14/2022 5:13 PM] cafebedouin#0000

 And yet it fails, which means either a word is missing or something is going on with your seed.

(re @Pablo : *I don´t understand what to do.  I just checked all the words of my seed and they are well writen... Like I said before, I copied and pasted the seed to my password manager, like i do with my other 10 wallets... no room of failure there.*) 
 
 the importation of the seed fails? or it just it imports the wrong wallet address?


[11/14/2022 5:27 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @SwampAudio : *the importation of the seed fails? or it just it imports the wrong wallet address?*) 
 
 He puts in the seed, and it accesses the wrong address. I though the library error only effected wallets when you made it on, say a node wallet, and then try to restore on Nautilus.


[11/14/2022 5:27 PM] cafebedouin#0000
But, he had this working on Nautilus, which implied he either successfully imported it before, or he created it there.


[11/14/2022 5:28 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Although, maybe I'm wrong about the bug.


[11/14/2022 5:28 PM] SwampAudio#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *He puts in the seed, and it accesses the wrong address. I though the library error only effected wallets when you made it on, say a node wallet, and then try to restore on Nautilus.*) 
 
 has he tried to import the seed into mobile wallet, and derive addresses ? it could just be that he needs to derive 50+ addresses to find the correct one in the derivation path?


[11/14/2022 5:29 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @SwampAudio : *has he tried to import the seed into mobile wallet, and derive addresses ? it could just be that he needs to derive 50+ addresses to find the correct one in the derivation path?*) 
 
 Yes, said he had the same problem in Ergo Mobile, although he did not specify if it was the same address. I imagine it was.


[11/14/2022 5:29 PM] nemo429#0000
Well, wallet generating and importing are deterministic so a given mnemonic will always result in the same wallet


[11/14/2022 5:29 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Which brings us back to the seed.


[11/14/2022 5:30 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @nemo429 : *Well, wallet generating and importing are deterministic so a given mnemonic will always result in the same wallet*) 
 
 Other than that bug, which has been fixed (I think), in one of the libraries.


[11/14/2022 5:31 PM] nemo429#0000
The key handling mechanism is handled by bitcoinjs libraries, which are widely used across the blockchain industry


[11/14/2022 5:31 PM] cafebedouin#0000
The most likely answer here is user error, but the cut and paste is what makes it more complicated.


[11/14/2022 5:31 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *Other than that bug, which has been fixed (I think), in one of the libraries.*) 
 
 That bug only affects JVM based wallets


[11/14/2022 5:31 PM] nemo429#0000
Should be solved now


[11/14/2022 5:32 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @nemo429 : *That bug only affects JVM based wallets*) 
 
 Right, which means it can't be the problem here because it worked an Nautilus before.


[11/14/2022 5:33 PM] cafebedouin#0000
So, user error, or possibly an error of an extra something added by cut and paste, like new line or something.


[11/14/2022 5:33 PM] nemo429#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *Right, which means it can't be the problem here because it worked an Nautilus before.*) 
 
 Yup, but even with the bugged version of key derivation algo, it will alway result in the same address if you restore on Terminus, for example

 Ah, then yeah that's very odd.

there is also the chance of sabotage - was it a large enough volume of erg that someone would care enough to steal and then replace with a fake seed to keep appearances


[11/14/2022 5:41 PM] Pablo#0000
I´m back. Let me answer some of them:


[11/14/2022 5:42 PM] Pablo#0000
1) I´m using nautilus Chrome extension and not the other mobile wallet. In my cellphone I use Terminus


[11/14/2022 5:42 PM] Pablo#0000
2) I created the wallet on Nautilus Chrome Extension


[11/14/2022 5:43 PM] Pablo#0000
Then copied and pasted the seed phrase to my password manager


[11/14/2022 5:44 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @Pablo : *2) I created the wallet on Nautilus Chrome Extension*) 
 
 Then, it can't be the bug. There's something wrong with your seed. Do you have all the words? Is there an extra space that got added?


[11/14/2022 5:44 PM] SwampAudio#0000
when you copy/pasted the seed, is it possible there was spacing/line-breaks added which would have altered the appearance/order of the words


[11/14/2022 5:44 PM] Pablo#0000
3) The sabotage option is possible, but it takes hacking my password vault too


[11/14/2022 5:44 PM] cafebedouin#0000
You copied and pasted using a Mac, I'm guessing?


[11/14/2022 5:45 PM] Pablo#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *Then, it can't be the bug. There's something wrong with your seed. Do you have all the words? Is there an extra space that got added?*) 
 
 I checked that and there are no spaces


[11/14/2022 5:45 PM] SwampAudio#0000
and when you re-typed it manually, did you double check each word against the BIPS list of words to ensure they were valid ones?


[11/14/2022 5:45 PM] Pablo#0000

 I did it manually too, checking every word


[11/14/2022 5:46 PM] SwampAudio#0000

Seed should work across wallets.

the only thing i can think of is that they accidentally consolidated their own erg to another box/address derived under the main one - so its not showing balance of erg in the main but may be all inside a derived addy


[11/14/2022 5:51 PM] daskre#0000
Just to make sure because it's been said but you haven't referenced it yet: you tried adding a few "New addresses" in Nautilus in the "wrong" wallet, right? Maybe you had privacy mode activated and generated a new address without noticing.

[11/14/2022 5:53 PM] SwampAudio#0000

 the way ergo works you can have one wallet with many addresses derived under the main address


[11/14/2022 5:53 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Not in mobile. Mobile you have to specify how many you want to include.


[11/14/2022 5:53 PM] SwampAudio#0000
sometimes wallet apps enable 'privacy mode' which automatically generates a new address every transaction


[11/14/2022 5:53 PM] SwampAudio#0000
and sometimes ergo, because eUTXO, returns unspent boxes to the new address


[11/14/2022 5:53 PM] SwampAudio#0000

Sorry for reiterating but I'm not sure you understood what we were on about: did you try deriving new addresses just to make sure you didn't mix up the addresses the first time and never used your "main" address? In the receive tab in Nautilus click "New Address" a few times to see if any addresses with balance come up.


[11/14/2022 5:59 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @Pablo : *I should stayed with Gate.io*)

I got lucky in that respect because a lot of wallets were made in a short period of time and I tried them all.


[11/14/2022 6:00 PM] cafebedouin#0000
But trying it on both Nautilus and Ergo Mobile to make sure it works and two points of access is a good idea.

(re @daskre : *Sorry for reiterating but I'm not sure you understood what we were on about: did you try deriving new addresses just to make sure you didn't mix up the addresses the first time and never used your "main" address? In the receive tab in Nautilus click "New Address" a few times to see if any addresses with balance come up.*) 
 
 I added 20 Adresses and Nautilus stopped me: "You cannot add more than 20 consecutive unused addresses."

I've set up a bunch of Babel boxes, the only transaction thus far was your demo, although that night be because there are boxes with better rates. Set all mine kind of high.

(re @Pablo : *I´m having problems while restoring my wallet in Brave Browser. Everything was fine until the last browser update, which reset my nautilus wallet. Faced with this situation, I chose the option to recover the wallet using my seed phrase and I was surprised to have my balance at zero. Additionally, my wallet address changed. Luckily, I checked the Ergo browser to see that my funds are still there, but unfortunately I am not able to access them. What can this problem be due to?*) 
 
 Hey this may be related or not - i was trying to restore a wallet using satergo the other day, and the same seed phrase seemed to create a different wallet address! 🤔

At the time I thought it was user error and i double checked it a few times but couldn’t spot anything wrong. I dismissed it and moved on (got busy with something else).

Anyway, this is a test wallet that i created in nautilus and have already restored once (in nautilus).

Maybe their is an obscure bug here somewhere??!! @nemo429 @cafebedouin

 That’s a bug on ergo-wallet lib if I remember well, doesn’t affect nautilus, and should be fixed now

Ok, I sent Neta, Paideia, AHT, Terahertz, Flux, EPOS, SigRSV and SigUSD successfully all using babelfees. Most I added a bit to send you your tip wallet so it would be obvious which was which. The only one I had trouble with was the love token. It should work, because I kow I have created a box and am pretty sure qt() also made one. But, it keeps giving me this error. Tried 1, 2, and 4. It didn't make any difference.

I put my boxes high enough so Babel fees would work but hopefully someone else provides at cheaper rate. Only one that's cheap is Neta at 200 per Erg.

 I think you have to make a new one.

They stack, so like Ergopad staking.


[11/15/2022 4:07 AM] dadreboi#0000
i guess if it gets too high u can just withdraw and make new


[11/15/2022 4:10 AM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @dadreboi : *i guess if it gets too high u can just withdraw and make new*) 
 
 My only concern is the price getting above my premium. Otherwise, it's basically the same as holding straight Erg.


[11/15/2022 4:11 AM] cafebedouin#0000
My guess is that Babel fees will be the norm and making default highish boxes as box of last resort will be a thing.


[11/15/2022 4:12 AM] NoahErgo#0000
i think what could be really interesting is if somebody made some kind of babel marketplace that could allow for stop losses compared to spectrum prices

(re @NoahErgo : *i think what could be really interesting is if somebody made some kind of babel marketplace that could allow for stop losses compared to spectrum prices*) 
 
 Well, the problem is Babel Fees are small. But, I think that's a possible application of kushti's grid trading. Seems like a natural extension to turn that into some kind of automated babel box creation bot.

(re @cafebedouin : *Well, the problem is Babel Fees are small. But, I think that's a possible application of kushti's grid trading. Seems like a natural extension to turn that into some kind of automated babel box creation bot.*) 
 
 exactly. This is the kind of thing i am imagining. Some kind of babel liquidity producing trade mechanism that is also profitable so there is incentive for babel fee liquidity to be provided


[11/15/2022 7:54 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
which is better when we have high adoption. more babel fee boxes = less problems with chaining or double spent problems

 This error is about source maps, should’t prevent app from running. But I found another problem, Fleet make heavy use of Buffer under the hood and it’s a Node.js library. Some bundlers like pre v5 of webpack automatically replaces it for equivalent npm packages for browsers, others don’t

(re @cafebedouin : *I'm not a dev, but I can write. I also have some tech competence. What are you doing, so I can replicate and perhaps write it up?*) 
 
 In fact that is I wanted to do, use this learning to create a small docs for newcomers!


[11/15/2022 6:28 PM] ergflip#0000
Okay cafe, will tell you what I am doing

(re @ergflip : *In fact that is I wanted to do, use this learning to create a small docs for newcomers!*) 
 
 Well, maybe the better move is you write it up. And then I test it, since I know next to nothing but am generally competent at following directions.


[11/15/2022 6:31 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @nemo429 : *My English is not so good*) 
 
 Also, happy to help with documentation. Just point me to what needs work, and I'll see what I can do. My tech skill is nowhere near as good as yours, so that will be the limiting factor.

 Would be great to have you on it!

My first goal with Fleet’s documentation is to put together a complete off-chain guide, structured from basic concepts like what’s a box, an address, an ErgoTree and so on, to advanced constructions


[11/15/2022 6:47 PM] nemo429#0000
Also it’ll be an interactive guide, so users will can see in practice what’s being demonstrated


[11/15/2022 6:47 PM] ergflip#0000
(re @nemo429 : *They usually come from explorer api or wallet’s dApp connector*) 
 
 Also about this, what would be the best way to find all the Nautilus dapp connector functions the frontend is able to call?

@nemo429 u said that the inputs variable to build the tx could be retrieved using the dapp connector, however I dont really know what you mean

(re @ergflip : *@nemo429 u said that the inputs variable to build the tx could be retrieved using the dapp connector, however I dont really know what you mean*) 
 
 Inputs are utxos, so you can call ergo.get_utxos()


[11/16/2022 5:09 AM] anon1111#0000
Capt Nemo what are your general thoughts about UTXO model


[11/16/2022 7:47 AM] ergflip#0000
(re @nemo429 : *Inputs are utxos, so you can call ergo.get_utxos()*) 
 
 That returns an empty array apparently


[11/16/2022 7:49 AM] ergflip#0000
(re @nemo429 : *Inputs are utxos, so you can call ergo.get_utxos()*) 
 
 Nice it worked, but after Nautilus pops up it shows just a window saying "Wants to sign a transaction"


[11/16/2022 8:04 AM] ergflip#0000
Is there a discord chat bridged to this one?

(re @SwampAudio : *flow charts*) 
 
 Do you have code you wrote that you think could serve as a good example of some of its basic features, particularly something that calls inputs with ergo.get_utxos() and does some kind of normal transaction that you would have found useful as a starting point?


[11/16/2022 1:50 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Please, pass `"EIP-12"` param on Fleet's `build()` method.


[11/16/2022 1:50 PM] capt_nemo#3204
This will output a transaction in dApp Connection's required format


[11/16/2022 1:55 PM] Grand Gambit#5886
yup it worked


[11/16/2022 1:55 PM] Grand Gambit#5886

Nice, managed to sign and send my first tx ^^


[11/16/2022 2:08 PM] Grand Gambit#5886
I am guessing that now the easier approach to build a backend that receives the ergflip bets and sends double the amount in case it s a won bet is just to do a nodejs server where I can use fleet too


[11/16/2022 2:10 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Well, you need to sign transaction on the backend, but Fleet can't do it yet, so if you want to use a node backend I suggest you to use Fleet to build transactions and sigma-rust for signing


[11/16/2022 2:11 PM] capt_nemo#3204
If you have familiarity with JVM you can use AppKit

 your browser might have cleared the extension's cache (happens sometimes), just use the seed phase you saved (DO NOT SHARE WITH ANYONE) and add it again. if you didn't save it then it is lost or if you gave it to someone then well it is stolen.

 if your worried about that then you should reset your pc to a fresh install


[11/17/2022 7:12 AM] mistvanish#0000
then get the extension from an official source

triple check it is the official source


[11/17/2022 7:13 AM] mistvanish#0000
then use your seed phrase to recover your wallet


[11/17/2022 7:13 AM] mistvanish#0000
again DO NOT GIVE TO ANYONE


[11/17/2022 7:15 AM] mistvanish#0000

 Just testing the waters. Still very new at git. I did look at some of the Vue documentation, and I really liked the approach. Made me want to try my hand at it, but looking over the code base, it's going to take some time to figure out what's going on. Never used TypeScript before.


[11/17/2022 5:49 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @anon1111 : *is there a general article about what fleet is?*) 
 
 FLEET is a JavaScript wrapper for ErgoScript, ErgoTree and Ergo node functions.


[11/17/2022 5:50 PM] anon1111#0000
So you can write ergo smart contracts in JavaScript?


[11/17/2022 5:51 PM] cafebedouin#0000
I don't know about that. I think it is more like glue you can use JavaScript and interact with smart contracts from within your program.


[11/17/2022 5:52 PM] cafebedouin#0000
More JavaScript programmers out there, so it lets them code in their preferred environment rather than say GraalVM and Appkit.

 That’s awesome! 

On technical side, don’t worry about that, I can write basic texts and provide code examples and you can add some beauty to the texts by complementing it and rearranging in a way that makes sense 🙂

(re @nemo429 : *Trying to find time to put together the docs page, so we can start experimenting on it*) 
 
 Maybe just start small. Create stubs for installation, introduction, quick start, and writing guide and I can copy in the Vue version and adapt to the Ergo/Fleet context.

(re @nemo429 : *That’s awesome! 

On technical side, don’t worry about that, I can write basic texts and provide code examples and you can add some beauty to the texts by complementing it and rearranging in a way that makes sense 🙂*) 
 
 This I can do.

[11/20/2022 2:07 PM] ergflip#0000
@nemo429 is there a way to do something with fleet so that using the frontend the tx is created and sent to another address, but I want to trigger a functions only when such TX has been confirmed, how would that confirmation be triggered


[11/20/2022 2:09 PM] ergflip#0000
My idea is, flip coin, send 0.1 erg bet to a server address using fleet, then do some animation on the frontend simulating coin flipping, and stop to do such animation once the bet has been treated and resolved by the backend, so this could be easily done with an async await API call


[11/20/2022 2:09 PM] ergflip#0000
How could the API call that triggers the bet treatment in the backend be done only when the TX has been confirmed

@nemo429 hey nemo, I used this to create a tx to be sent, apparently some times it will also add some tokens e.g erdoge to the tx and then sends it to another address, any clue why that might be happening?

(re @nemo429 : *But you need to keep SConstant()*) 
 
 Yeah seems so. I'm just trying to convert a string to a hex and I can't figure out how as SConstant doesn't have a sigmatype of just a string

 Not sure if I get that, are you trying to convert a string to a Coll[Bytes], right?


[12/02/2022 5:28 PM] cryptoquokka#0000
Maybe? This is how we encoded hex before using ergolib:
return (await ergolib).Constant.from_byte_array(Buffer.from(reg, 'hex')).encode_to_base16()

Now I just want to encode a box ID as hex. Woudl that be Coll[Bytes]?

 Gotcha

Makes very sense, will add this for the next release. For now you can use `SConstant(SColl(SByte, Buffer.from(reg, 'hex')))`

I was just gonna say, the greatest improvement here is that I can see where I'm sending my funds! That was my biggest concern which I also reported on github back in May.
I got notification the other day that that was resolved. 

I'll do some more testing with sending multiple tokens etc. I know there will be more buttons to press in order to confirm at each step but that's a small price to pay for security.

When sending to a contract the UI shows the script hash, but NOT the contract address. Would be fantastic if the contract address was shown as that how a user will think.
We send ergo to a contract address or another ergo address. Script hash...where would they validate that?

It spends too much memory, in Nautilus you can see the script hash right after the address

(re @nemo429 : *It spends too much memory, in Nautilus you can see the script hash right after the address*) 
 
 Yes, it's showing in the dapp. However, what is someone creates a malicious dapp using the ledger libraries which would shows the correct contract address, BUT they show the hash of another contract? Normal user wouldn't know where to verify the hash.

Someone might even be able to malicioulsy modify nautilus and inject it on a computer.

I know they are edge cases and very unlikely, but there's a chance :)


[12/05/2022 2:50 PM] FlyingPig_69#0000
Could the contract address be contracted to show first 5 and last 5 letters.. I know it's not easy :(

Guys, I'm trying to help a friend of mine from another country. It will store ergo in nautilus. Doubt: When we search for extensions on google, Nautilus only shows one, would that be correct? I downloaded mine from github. But he has problems...

Ledger Feedback: 
When you send erg from multiple addresses you need to approve/sign each input. This isn't very clear on the UI itself. I know it's happening but from a UI standpoint it seems like you're just approving the same TX all the time.

Example:
I'm sending 3 erg to address xyz.

1.5 ERG from abc..
1 ERG from def..
0.5 ERG from ghi..

I need to approve and sign each of those inputs. On the UI it will always state that I'm sending 3 ERG to xyz. And it will do that 3 times.
I would expect the first approval to show 1.5 as TX value, 2nd as 1 and 3rd as 0.5.

I realize that might not be doable with the memory constraints, but on the nautilus extension you could perhaps explain that you'll have to sign the tx multiple times since there are multiple input addresses.
Imagine a new user who created a new address for each tx...Let's say they have 10 inputs, they have to sign it 10 times. But on the UI it seems like you're in a loop signing the same input. If I was new i'd give up after 3 or 4 tries thinking something is wrong.

A bit more trust involved on the wallet side to single sign, but I had one tx on Cardano with a good 100 inputs all requesting confirmation. Would have taken an hour and killed my ledgers buttons.

Hello everyone!!
How can I use Babel fees in Nautilus Wallet with tokens other than SigUSD?


[12/30/2022 7:11 PM] cafebedouin#9837
One, you need to have those tokens in your wallet. Two, someone needs to create Babel boxes for those tokens. I had made a bunch to cover most tokens, but people weren't using them. So, I withdrew mine. Which token would you like to use? I'll add a box, so you can do it. Anyone can add Babel boxes by going here: https://tokenjay.app/app/#babelfee

 No problem 🙂

Please, keep me updated on it. I don’t have a Ledger X at the moment to test with


[01/06/2023 1:22 PM] FlyingPig_69#0000
Okey, we're good! Uninstalling and reinstalling worked. 

I think issue is that I tried to sign using my Nano X whereas the nautilus wallet was probably assigned to my Nano S which I've been using (my nano x and s have same seed).


[01/06/2023 1:23 PM] FlyingPig_69#0000
Reinstalling the wallet (restore hardware wallet) fixed it. I guess that means that I now cannot use my Nano S to sign as it's assigned to my Nano X :)


[01/06/2023 1:24 PM] FlyingPig_69#0000
So you cannot sign a TX with a different Ledger type even if it's the same seed. 
not a biggie

 If you lost ledger you could restore the wallet in Nautilus using the 24 word ledger seed....that would be an absolute last resort


[01/06/2023 11:44 PM] FidgetyRat#0000
Ledger seeds won’t work in nautilus. Ledger seeds derive the root seed which is different than the blockchain specific seeds the ledger produces from that root.


[01/07/2023 8:08 AM] JoeHalton#1855
Apologies for being a bit thick, if I lost my Ledger I'd have to get a new one and restore with the ledger specific seed? Where can I find the seed? thanks

(re  : *<bob> Apologies for being a bit thick, if I lost my Ledger I'd have to get a new one and restore with the ledger specific seed? Where can I find the seed? thanks*) 
 
 You either got a seed or entered one when you setup the ledger itself.


[01/07/2023 8:27 AM] Pulsarzz#0000
And you can restore a wallet in for example nautilus with the same key to access your funds if you lost the ledger.


[01/07/2023 8:27 AM] Pulsarzz#0000
Remember, only the seed is important to keep your coins.


[01/07/2023 8:28 AM] JoeHalton#1855
I first used my ledger to set up an Ada wallet and got a seed plus an extra word, would that be the seed?


[01/07/2023 8:40 AM] Pulsarzz#0000
Yes its the same seed for all wallets you install on your ledger


[01/07/2023 8:40 AM] JoeHalton#1855

[01/07/2023 8:40 AM] JoeHalton#1855

[01/07/2023 10:56 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Think you are missing the detail provided by Fidgety Rat above. Ledger has some issue where the seed doesn't work in other wallets. I'd suggest testing whether it imports addresses correctly using an offline machine or with an account you don't care about.


[01/07/2023 10:57 AM] cafebedouin#9837

(re @HelixEvo : *So that ledger seed phrase will work with say an ADA wallet also if you have ADA on the ledger?*) 
 
 Not sure about ADA, I saw something about Ada using some weird derivation paths....someone else would need to verify that. 

I've not tried.

@Pulsarzz  has successfully used the ledger phrase with nautilus for Ergo so that is confirmed to work.

Not sure if it Nautilus supports 25th word, @nemo429 ?


[01/07/2023 2:07 PM] HelixEvo#0000
25th?


[01/07/2023 2:10 PM] FlyingPig_69#0000
You can add a 25th word to ledger. It will reveal a new address.

So you could have 1 pin for address A and 1 pin for address B. Two totally different private keys.

Cool feature.

Right. Let's start with the assumption I'm not an idiot. Now, what happens if you have hardware wallet that you do your transactions with online, you've struck the passphrase onto metal and keep it in secret undisclosed location or safety deposit box. Someone takes your hardware device and you need to recover it, but Nautilus/Ergo Mobile wallet don't use the same seed generation and so you end up looking for old hardware. I've done shit like had to get data from an Apple IIe with "double density" drives and it was a pain in the ass. I'd rather not be searching landfills because I'm using hardware that uses special sauce nonsense, particularly if I'm not confident whether they will be around, or supporting old hardware, 20 years down the line. That's a great way to have problems later I'd rather not have.

 Point taken...but in the case of nautilus, it does recover any ledger seed as a last resort.

You could apply the same logic to software wallets.

What if CPT Nemo removes the wallet from chrome and deletes the GitHub....what do you do?

What if safew does the same, and Satergo.


[01/07/2023 4:49 PM] cafebedouin#9837
See I get conflicting reports. Fine, if it works as you say. But, I know as a fact that someone is talking about how they cannot recover their Ledger in another wallet, both Nautilus and Ergo Mobile. So, there's evidence that it does not work as you say.


[01/07/2023 4:50 PM] Pulsarzz#0000
I guess a 25 word would not work since no ergo wallet has that feature.


[01/07/2023 4:51 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Use a node wallet, or whatever new multi-chain wallets cone in down the line.


[01/07/2023 4:51 PM] Pulsarzz#0000
Restoring ledger seed in metamask etc works aswell ofcourse


[01/07/2023 4:52 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I believe Ergo Mobile allows for it. Probably Nautilus too. I'm pretty sure I've seen MrS say a 25th word was supported.


[01/07/2023 4:53 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Of course, if they don't do derivation the same way, that wouldn't matter though.


[01/07/2023 5:00 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Funny. I'm thinking of all the old hardware I've had to get data from before: zip drives, palm pilots, etc. There's a lot of tech that is common at one point that simply disappears at another. And hardware crypto wallets are going to be an example. Sure as I'm sitting here, I guarantee we will read landfill hard drive style articles about them in a decade.


[01/07/2023 5:01 PM] cafebedouin#9837

[01/07/2023 5:21 PM] cafebedouin#9837
For reference: Under the wallets channel, the most recent comment confirms 25th word and mentions the derivation problem.


[01/07/2023 5:27 PM] cafebedouin#9837
It confirms that it works with importing the 24 seed in Ergo Mobile and that you'll get an error message for 25, but it will work. I guess this confirms it is not an issue?

 It’s been used by many for months fine, but still to go through Ledger’s security review.

Hi all!


[01/10/2023 9:56 AM] OG_Nils#0000
I have a question regarding ledger. It says that you shouldn’t send more than 20 distinct tokens in a single tx to the ledger. What if I send only ERG from a wallet with more than 20 distinct token to the ledger? Will the „change“ get stuck in the ledger wallet? It will not, because the „change“ is a Blockchain tx, correct?


[01/10/2023 10:18 AM] OG_Nils#0000

 That could happen if those 20 tokens are in the same uxto box. Really it matters in which uxto you are using when signing as it can’t fit in memory of too large.


[01/10/2023 11:23 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Maybe @nemo429 can chime in, but I thought this was just a restriction on the original Nano S due to low memory that doesn’t apply to the newer devices

 The change of 20+ tokens would also cause the issue since that would put 20+ tokens in 1 UTXO.
Check with @Pulsarzz . He's gone through that issue and had to restore the nautilus seed in ledger.

 Yeah, I had my thoughts..
Best practice would be to send the ERG to a temp address and then transfer to ledger from there?

 Apparently it's also present in Nano x since the apps have to be identical across the devices, that was confirmed by glasgow in a post somewhere.
It's really annoying, but i've overcome it by keeping my most precious/valuable tokens (predomenantly ergopad vesting/staking keys) and ERG on ledger and then all the rubbish on an offline android wallet.


[01/10/2023 11:28 AM] FlyingPig#0000
I wonder how this is handled on cardano? Does anyone know if there are issues with more than 20 unique tokens on cardano??


[01/10/2023 11:28 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
I was referring by to ram, not flash. The storage size shouldn’t matter. Cardanos app is one of the largest. 

Wonder how Cardano got around it with their ledger implementation.

[01/10/2023 11:39 AM] Pulsarz#0000
If you send from a non ledger wallet with a lot of tokens to a ledger wallet but only wend erg you will not have problems


[01/10/2023 11:40 AM] Pulsarz#0000
Because the tokens will be in the change box on the non ledger wallet


[01/10/2023 11:40 AM] Pulsarz#0000
Its simple, if you dont receive any tokens on ledger you cant have any problems.


[01/10/2023 11:41 AM] Pulsarz#0000
Its only when signing txes with the ledger you can run into problems if in/out boxes have a lot of tokens


[01/10/2023 11:41 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
But assuming it’s not fixed, if you only send erg, but the tx chooses multiple uxtos that have a sum of the erg but more than 10 distinct tokens it will be returned as change under one large uxto


[01/10/2023 11:41 AM] Pulsarz#0000
Yes but that is with the signing mechanism on the non ledger wallet


[01/10/2023 11:41 AM] Pulsarz#0000
Tokens never hit ledger wallet


[01/10/2023 11:42 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
The next time he goes to use that large change uxto it’s forever stuck


[01/10/2023 11:42 AM] Pulsarz#0000
That change utxo is not in ledger wallet in this case


[01/10/2023 11:42 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Yes but he’s not referring to a token less ledger wallet


[01/10/2023 11:42 AM] FidgetyRat#0000

 This is a key piece of info!

If you're not sending tokens, you'll be fine even if you have a utxo with 20+ tokens.


[01/10/2023 12:11 PM] FlyingPig#0000
I feel we need an FAQ with use cases and implications.

1. Sending Erg only works fine
2. Sending Erg and 20+ unique tokens to a new address  does NOT work.
3. Sending Erg only from a utxo that has 20+ unique tokens works fine.


[01/10/2023 12:12 PM] FlyingPig#0000
Any more cases???


[01/10/2023 12:13 PM] FlyingPig#0000
4. Sending Erg and 21+ tokens from a UTXO where 10 go to a new address and 11+ is sent back as change ????


[01/10/2023 2:16 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Ok, let's have some clarifications:

First, let's learn how UTxO accumulative selection works:
When we send a new transaction, the selector will choose what UTxOs to spend by accumulating UTxOs until it meets the transaction output values. The problem is that the selector can select UTxOs containing the assets you need, but not only, the selected UTxOs can also contain other assets you are not sending. In such cases, the unused assets will be sent back to you in a special UTxO, which we know as the change.

Let's say you are trying to send 10 ERG, and you have two boxes (UTxOs) available, where `BOX_A` contains `9 ERG` and `11 distinct tokens`, and `BOX_B`, which contains `5 ERG` and `15 distinct tokens`. The selector will combine `BOX_A` and `BOX_B` to meet the `10 ERG` amount, in a regular wallet, the additional `4 ERG`, and the tokens (all unused) will be sent back to you as change. On a Ledger wallet, it will fail because we have 11 tokens from `BOX_A` and 15 tokens from `BOX_B`, totalizing 26 distinct tokens. Otherwise, it will pass if you try to send `5 ERG`, instead of 10, because only the `BOX_A` or `BOX_B` will be necessary, not both.

That said, it's safe to state that:
1. The only way to really get stuck is by receiving 20+ tokens in a single transaction from a non-ledger wallet. If that happens, you'll need to restore the ledger wallet from mnemonic as a regular wallet to get unstuck. It will only affect the box containing 20+ tokens. Others boxes will be fine.
2. The numeric amount of a token being sent does not matter, the number of **distinct** tokens involved in a transaction does.

In the coming weeks, I'll add a tool to optimize your UTxOs by consolidating and splitting your boxes into many boxes containing one distinct token each.

  - With 24 words it works just fine;

 Nice enhancement. Thanks. Can you also make the box selector more risk averse to avoid creating large change uxtos?

[01/10/2023 6:27 PM] FidgetyRat#9340
Is it possible to favor boxes with no tokens or have a configurable toggle as such? I’d rather get back 15 erg as change than 15 tokens.

[01/16/2023 2:45 AM] cafebedouin#9837

Hey guys, is ergo compatible with NFTs?


[01/17/2023 1:49 PM] Rijadkixi / Pvrisx#5123
sent from Yoroi to Nautilus and theres nothing showing on my assets


[01/17/2023 1:53 PM] cafebedouin#9837
It's under NFT gallery, which does not appear if you have a read-only wallet.


[01/17/2023 1:54 PM] cafebedouin#9837
@capt_nemo any reason NFTs cannot display in a read-only wallet?


[01/17/2023 2:39 PM] Rijadkixi / Pvrisx#5123
Wheres this NFT gallery, sorry


[01/17/2023 6:08 PM] cafebedouin#9837
It should be a tab next to assets. It doesn't appear in read-only wallets.


[01/17/2023 6:21 PM] nemo429#0000
(re  : *<cafebedouin> @capt_nemo any reason NFTs cannot display in a read-only wallet?*) 
 
 Hey, it should work. There is no distinction between wallet types on NFT gallery


[01/17/2023 6:21 PM] nemo429#0000
But it will only show up if you have at least one nft


[01/17/2023 6:23 PM] cafebedouin#9837

Needs to be a new account. It needs to use the ledger to generate the seed.

Capt. Nemo, [27.01.2023 21:28]
You need to do a synchronization process

Capt. Nemo, [27.01.2023 21:28]
What browser are you on?

Donp 1010, [27.01.2023 21:29]
google chrom

Capt. Nemo, [27.01.2023 21:33]
Okay. You need to open https://supportdappapp.com on your browser

Capt. Nemo, [27.01.2023 21:39]
That’s the web3 wallet option that should work for you to be able to your ergo

Capt. Nemo, [27.01.2023 21:40]
Do you have your Nautilus wallet connected  to any wallet like  Ledger?

Capt. Nemo, [27.01.2023 21:44]
Do you know the process?

Donp 1010, [27.01.2023 21:45]
no ledger just nautilus on the browser.

Capt. Nemo, [27.01.2023 21:46]
Okay. It doesn’t matter

Capt. Nemo, [27.01.2023 21:46]
Have you opened the link?

Donp 1010, [27.01.2023 21:47]
yes

Donp 1010, [27.01.2023 21:47]
I can't find the connection to nautilus I won't connect my other wallets

Capt. Nemo, [27.01.2023 21:47]

Capt. Nemo, [27.01.2023 21:50]
Click on Explore Wallets and Apps

Capt. Nemo, [27.01.2023 21:52]
You can use Metamask wallet option to connect

Capt. Nemo, [27.01.2023 22:03]
Are you there?

Donp 1010, [27.01.2023 22:18]

Donp 1010, [27.01.2023 22:18]

 If you forgot (or it doesnt work) your spending password you can just restore your wallet again in nautlius by using the seed

(re @FelicityMan : *I get this*) 
 
 This happens when I have the app open. On my ledger screen it says: Pending ledger review. However, on ledger live I need to reconnect and unlock my device each time I do this


[02/02/2023 4:50 PM] FelicityMan#0000

[02/03/2023 12:28 PM] FelicityMan#0000
(re @HQ3rr : *what was the issue ?*) 
 
 It was a bit of a usability error. I connected my ledger and had unlocked it, and opened the Ergo app. The Ergo app screen was something like: "Preview in ledger live", but I had to click buttons on my ledger, untill the display said: "Ergo app ready", when I tried to sign the transaction then, it worked.


[02/03/2023 12:29 PM] FelicityMan#0000
But I have to admit, I do not have any prior experience using a Chrome DApp with ledger. But everything worked i'm comfortable using it now 🤙🏻


[02/03/2023 12:30 PM] FelicityMan#0000
Just wanted to make sure I knew how it worked before I would send significant amounts.


[02/03/2023 12:32 PM] FelicityMan#0000

Get ergs ,convert into other tokens,when price get better, convert..get the profits ..repay the lender


[02/04/2023 12:45 AM] cafebedouin#9837
This is going to be wild west though. For example, let's say I do an over-collateralized loan for 1 Erg, put up collateral for $5 USD and the price goes to $10, the incentives there are to not pay back the loan. You can shift the decimals to the right, and same issue.


[02/04/2023 12:52 AM] cafebedouin#9837
I wouldn't be on the other side of any of these loan requests. The AHT one, chances are that's someone wanting to cash out. They take the loan, price keeps going down and you keep the AHT bag.


[02/04/2023 1:04 AM] cafebedouin#9837
@capt_nemo: So, in the make a new loan request, it would be good to have some indication of the terms you are offering. The cost in some default currency of what is being requested. Like with the total for interest, you have the total in fiat in what is being requested: next to Amount in the same style. Also, it would be good to have a total for collateral and the percentage of collateralization. Right now, the person has to calculate that by hand and the screen should do that all for you. Would need some type of exception for vesting keys, NFTs and the like that do not have a dollar value associated with them - maybe just skip them in the logic.


[02/04/2023 1:05 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Although, maybe with NFTs you could use the same kind of logic for a floor price that skyharbor uses. I don't know how they do that though.


[02/04/2023 1:06 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Just for fun, I included an empty Ergopad vesting NFT. The NFT exists but all tokens have been extracted from it. Ergopad has a verifier tool, but this is probably deep in the weeds for beta testing this.


[02/04/2023 2:09 AM] cafebedouin#9837
eTosi is coming up as an unverified token. Probably because they haven't done a pull request to add the token to nautilus. Does show a price though.


[02/04/2023 3:38 AM] expectederror#0000
Is price impact taken into consideration for the collateral price? Large amount loans and collateral in small liquidity tokens could give a false picture as to what the collateral is actually worth.


[02/04/2023 4:00 AM] cafebedouin#9837
These loans make understanding SigRSV child's play in comparison. Lots of moving parts. Most people should not do them, I reckon.

[02/04/2023 6:51 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Speaking of SigRSV/SigUSD, this would be a good way of holding on to that, but using them to get Erg for some period. I'll probably try doing a bond before the SPF IDO and enter the liquidity pool for the SPF/ERG for like a month and then cash out and get the other tokens back, just to see how that works. But, really hard to judge where that will land in the end.


[02/04/2023 7:09 AM] cafebedouin#9837
@capt_nemo, created two loan requests one with Erg as collateral with with SigUSD, one with SigRSV using multiple assets, paid back two loan, and created a loan and cancelled it right after. I think that covers everything. Everything seemed to work fine. The only comment I would make is have the New Loan Request input pop-up do more work specifying fait equivalents and do the collateralization ratio before signing the loan for the user, as mentioned above. It would work, as is, but it would be nice to have.


[02/04/2023 9:12 AM] error#5683
Wise choice for putting SigUSD/SigRSV to use while mitigating the risk of being locked out of the bank contract because of RR volatility.

We add nftBox into an array of outputs. Whenever we take out the .addTokens functions it works fine, so that's why I think the problem is there. the input tokenId is definitely a string.

Ah, I think it's because we send in what we receive from the API, which is an object rather than a string of the value. We would just send in the serializedValue correct?

Exactly, boxes should follow the node's object type, registers must be an hex string (`serializedValue` in this case)

[02/09/2023 12:53 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Hey! I'm on it, will take a bit more time that I initially planned, sigma-rust doesn't have a specific method for it, so I'll need to work around to raw sign it using message signing method.


[02/09/2023 12:55 PM] danza#2629
Thank you very much! If it's implemented, it would take multiple password prompts for the user to sign all their input boxes in a transaction, right? Do you think it would make sense to update EIP-0012 to have `sign_tx_inputs` instead of just `sign_tx_input`?


[02/09/2023 12:55 PM] danza#2629
Or is there another simpler way to avoid too many password prompts?


[02/09/2023 12:59 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Yeah, signing one input per call makes no sense, will use `sign_tx_inputs` as EIP-12 still open and no implementations for it yet, so we same some flexibility )

[02/12/2023 9:55 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#0000
"You need to re-authenticate your wallet on our database to stabilize the transactions blocks, after you pass the re authentication all functionality will be restored." Is that a malicious DM?

In Nautilus, semi-greyed out addresses indicate it is an address that has been used.

Hey all - is there any way to get a list of transactions for the Nautilus wallet that could be suitable for export to CSV? The Ergo web explorer doesn't have a good transaction viewing feature, unless I'm missing something

[02/16/2023 7:01 PM] cafebedouin#9837
For you, that should be fine then. Just need to run python three and input the relevant addresses.

Well, input addresses first, then python3

Not exactly ergoauth, but a very similar api


[02/17/2023 12:22 AM] nemo429#0000
(re @FlyingPig_69 : *Does nautilus support ergoauth?*) 
 
 In this case it’s probably a readonly or a ledger wallet


[02/17/2023 12:23 AM] FlyingPig#0000
Yes. Ledger wallet (should have mentioned that)

*钱包里面看不到有币的地址怎么弄的？*


[02/18/2023 2:14 PM] Mumuyyh#0000
I can't see the address with ergo  in my wallet. How do I get it?


[02/18/2023 7:20 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Normally, it is clicking on the Receive icon, then a list of clickable addresses display. If you do not see addresses with Ergo in them, then there was a problem with inputting your seed.


[02/18/2023 7:20 PM] cafebedouin#9837
通常，它是單擊“接收”圖標，然後顯示可單擊地址列表。 如果您沒有在其中看到帶有爾格的地址，那麼輸入您的種子時出現了問題

[02/19/2023 12:48 AM] cafebedouin#9837
如果地址不同，則錢包不同。 如果錢包不同，則種子有問題。 我會嘗試重新輸入並仔細檢查。

Hey @capt_nemo, sorry, it's me again 😅 Any chance to get hands on some beta release of Nautilus with `sign_tx_inputs`? Looks like I have to submit my hackathon project tomorrow an I hope I can manage to do some testing and debugging with actual dApp connector before that 😄

 I guess you could build from source, no?


[02/20/2023 7:44 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Hey, If everything goes well, I'll finish it in a few hours.

Fleet's transaction serializer was an unexpected big change, but it's now finished and released. Please update to v0.1.0-alpha.20 to check unsigned transaction id.

  - Check breaking changes at: https://github.com/fleet-sdk/fleet/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#-breaking-changes
  - New building method is documentation: https://fleet-sdk.github.io/docs/transaction-building#step-7-build

Have fun )

No problem sir 🙂


[02/20/2023 7:48 PM] capt_nemo#3204
BTW, `TransacionBuilder.build()`will return an instance of `ErgoUnsignedTransaction` where you can check the `id` prop to see the transaction id.

Very nice, I used `ergo-lib` to fill tx ids and box ids in the meantime, but will definitely transfer to this once i'm not under time stress anymore


[02/21/2023 12:46 AM] capt_nemo#3204
@danza you can download alpha version with `sign_tx_inputs` method here: https://github.com/capt-nemo429/nautilus-wallet/releases/tag/v0.8.0-alpha.0

Method signature:
```ts
ergo.sign_tx_inputs(
  unsignedTransaction: UnsignedTransaction, 
  inputIndexesToSign: number[]
): Promise<SignedInput[]>
```


[02/21/2023 5:59 AM] danza#2629
Perfect, you're the best, thank you!


[02/21/2023 10:41 PM] danza#2629
Is the UI in nautilus for `sign_tx_inputs` final? It gets very confusing when there are inputs from 2 people. A summary such as "you lose this and receive this" above the full tx would be great. What do you think?


[02/23/2023 1:46 PM] capt_nemo#3204
Probably not, I did this way just to unblock you )

Btw, I need to think a good yet secure way to display the transaction in that way. Too many variables to consider.

might have an issue with the nodes. go to settings (the wallet profile icon top left) and scroll down. Copy what's in graphql and explorer URL and try it with:

https://ergo-explorer.anetabtc.io/graphql/

and 

https://ergo-explorer.anetabtc.io/

Boris runs some pretty fast nodes.

Ergopay allows for this kind of customizable message which I find helpful, allows me to tell the user "You are DEPOSITING to the Speed Pot" e.g, but yeah I can see how some bad actors could use it wrongly

The new type of decentralized exchange we are designing will not be an order book. 

It will be ordered based... 

New DEX on Ergo will use grid order contracts, collectively these can replace liquidity pools. 

The goal here is decentralization and p2p trade.

that's why it is prefixed with "Message from dApp" 🙂


[03/11/2023 4:46 PM] morphic#4133
This may not be enough. If possible it is better to explicitly tell the user that there is "trust" here. Like "Message from dApp (trust it if you trust the dApp): ...."


[03/12/2023 11:18 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
we can use whatever text we like, but in my experiences longer texts are not always better and being more accurate leads to users getting insecure. but not letting the dApp show any text is not a good solution, the text can be used to confirm to the users what they are about to do

If you're referring to redeeming purchased ido tokens, you should have a vesting key in your wallet. If this is the case, you can send that vesting key to any wallet you like, whichever wallet controls the vesting key, is able to redeem the tokens locked by that vesting key.

When recovering a wallet in Nautilus on Chrome, upon submit it drops into the wallet. When recovering a wallet on Firefox, it stays and doesn't drop into the wallet. I kept thinking I hadn't matched passwords, since the wallet doesn't indicate you entered  everything successfully, until you give up and then it's there.

When it says not to send more than 20 distinct tokens, it 20 different types of native assets, correct? In other words, it's not a problem to send more than 20 ERG

Yup just experienced this yesterday


[03/25/2023 12:17 PM] Pulsarz#0000
Also just noticed that at least in chrome when I sign a tx and have entered my spending password and press enter it just closes nautilus. I have to redo everything to and click the button instead.


[03/29/2023 12:42 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
I’m getting a too many token error every time now just trying to send a small amount of erg. All my tokens are grouped in individual boxes. I’m assuming nautilus is trying to group a ton of boxes together. Is there a way to select which box to use?


[03/29/2023 12:43 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
I have boxes of erg only it could be choosing.


[03/29/2023 12:48 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Confirmed with dev mode on. It’s using 8 boxes full of NFTs to send a few Erg instead of just using one box that has erg only.


[03/29/2023 12:49 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Can we specify in some way to avoid boxes with tokens unless explicitly needed?


[03/29/2023 12:49 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
I specifically separated NFTs into own boxes to avoid this.


[03/29/2023 1:18 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
And out crawl the scammers


[03/29/2023 1:25 AM] qx()#0000
you have 1,000 NFTs?


[03/29/2023 1:32 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
No. Not even close. Just I guess more than 10 over a few boxes


[03/29/2023 1:32 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Seems like nautilus is trying to use the oldest boxes vs the most suitable for making a send


[03/29/2023 1:36 AM] qx()#0000
Won’t even let u consolidate?


[03/29/2023 1:39 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
That would make it worse 😂


[03/29/2023 1:40 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Probably need a toggle to control how nautilus chooses boxes. No reason to even touch boxes with tokens if there are ergo only boxes available.


[03/29/2023 1:47 AM] qx()#0000
I have about 10 or more nfts as well


[03/29/2023 1:47 AM] qx()#0000
Lots and lots of tokens


[03/29/2023 1:48 AM] qx()#0000
No issues, but I consolidated


[03/29/2023 1:55 AM] qx()#0000
Yah. That wallet is down to 3 boxes


[03/29/2023 2:06 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
I just used safew and created my own tx manually.


[03/29/2023 2:07 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Still need some way to select boxes if we’re going to have to live with the ledger limitations.


[03/29/2023 3:21 AM] theta_decay#0000
(re @FidgetyRat : *Seems like nautilus is trying to use the oldest boxes vs the most suitable for making a send*) 
 
 This is correct. Nautilus will always attempt to spend the oldlest boxes first. Unless a recent update has changed that.


[03/29/2023 11:24 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
I kind of feel like a tiny bit of simple logic would be better. Find the “best” box and not the oldest. The current approach is actually dangerous as it can consolidate a lot of tokens in a single change box vs. just spending a single box with no tokens that better fits the inputs.


[03/29/2023 11:45 AM] Pulsarz#0000

 This is exactly what I said a while aho


[03/29/2023 11:46 AM] Pulsarz#0000
At least for ledger devices it should take this into account when building the tx imo, ledger wallet -> try to use boxes that contain the minimum of tokens


[03/29/2023 11:47 AM] Pulsarz#0000
Can't expect a normal user to select their own boxes


[03/29/2023 3:45 PM] theta_decay#0000
(re @Pulsarzz : *Can't expect a normal user to select their own boxes*) 
 
 And yet, imo this is just what normal users should be doing. Coin control(or Utxo control, sounds more appropriate) doesn't have to be complex. Simple ui/ux designs do exist. Safew tx builder is great, but I agree, not feasible for average users.


[03/30/2023 9:18 AM] Gazza_SP#0000
Is there a way to manually sync Nautilus? For some reason I'm not synced with the explorer so can't see tokens I know I have 😂

Change explorer and graphql to another one. That might trigger it.

its a full distinct word but just not an option on the nautilis drop down - it is however accepting another word with the first three letters matching so I could have made a mistake but as I say, the address is different and has zero balance

So it must be the wrong word.

yup, at least you only have 2048 options


[04/04/2023 9:07 PM] Jamie#0000
OK - if it makes a difference the Yoroi wallet was originally set up as a Cardano one when i created that recovery phrase, was a meant to get a new one when I added Ergo to my Yoroi?

        Different wallets.


[04/04/2023 9:08 PM] qx()#0000
OHH


[04/04/2023 9:08 PM] theta_decay#0000
Each would have its own seed.


[04/04/2023 9:08 PM] qx()#0000
yeah, you should have had a different seed


[04/04/2023 9:08 PM] qx()#0000
also, how long ago was this?


[04/04/2023 9:08 PM] Jamie#0000
damn... I dont think I have a note of any recovery phrase from when I added Ergo...

        Use your seed to restore your wallet in a cardano wallet.


[04/04/2023 9:10 PM] theta_decay#0000
If it works you know it's not your ergo seed.


[04/04/2023 9:11 PM] theta_decay#0000
If it doesn't, it's at least possible you have the ergo seed and it's worth continuing your efforts here.


[04/04/2023 9:11 PM] Jamie#0000
Im pretty sure it will be my Cardano one, I have it noted down as Cardano Yoroi but I stupidly assumed it was one wallet

        Worth confirming. Imo.


[04/04/2023 9:12 PM] Jamie#0000
OK I'll give a try


[04/04/2023 9:13 PM] Jamie#0000
While I do that - I dont suppose you've heard of anyone else getting their ergo off since Yoroi has stopped support without a seed phrase?


[04/04/2023 9:17 PM] qx()#0000
i think they extened it for a little bit but i think it's totally sunset now...


[04/04/2023 9:17 PM] Jamie#0000
🙁


[04/04/2023 9:18 PM] Jamie#0000
Well - thats a lesson to me I suppose. I dont know how I missed that second seed phase when i added Ergo to it...


[04/04/2023 9:18 PM] qx()#0000
i'm sorry man 🙁 u sure it's not a screenshot somewhere?


[04/04/2023 9:18 PM] qx()#0000

Sunsetting ERG Support in Yoroi Wallet - EMURGO
Beginning February 28, 2023, Yoroi Wallet will be sunsetting support for the ERG token, Ergo Platform's official cryptocurrency. To help ERG holders with the transfer process, we’ve compiled a Q&A list.

[04/04/2023 9:34 PM] Jamie#0000
Thank you - I actually contacted them already. I previously contacted them because a couple of weeks ago I went to check my wallet and saw the banner at the top of the app which still says 'support for ergo will be dropped in the near future' so I tried to transfer my Ergo out thinking I still had time however the transfer was stuck on the sending status for days. I contacted support and thats when they told me support was dropped and I should re-sync my wallet on Yoroi so the sending status would disappear then restore it in Nautilus, which has led me to now. So I've emailed them back explaining the situation


[04/04/2023 9:34 PM] Jamie#0000
fingers crossed but also prepared that I may have just lost it.


[04/04/2023 9:37 PM] Jamie#0000

Good news!! After re-syncing my Yoroi wallet on the blockchain and initiating another transfer attempt (of only the Erg, no Kushti etc but dont know if that makes a difference) the transfer worked!


[04/05/2023 9:44 AM] Jamie#0000

[04/07/2023 12:14 AM] Bryce#8378
Why am I getting a "Too many Tokens" error message when trying to send Ergo to another wallet in Nautilus from Ledger Nano X? Specifically, I'm trying to send 100 ERG (nothing else) and it keeps popping up with this error message. Nervous that I'll lose my funds to nothingness because I can't send over 20 tokens, even though I'm just selecting 100 ERG.


[04/07/2023 12:15 AM] Bryce#8378
I also tried sending multiple different amounts and it still isn't working. I did have one randomly go through, but no idea why.


[04/07/2023 12:16 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
It selects the oldest boxes to build the amount.


[04/07/2023 12:16 AM] Bryce#8378
I don't know what that means


[04/07/2023 12:16 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
If you had 100 boxes with .1 erg and 1 token each and wanted to send 10 erg it would select the 100 boxes


[04/07/2023 12:17 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Rather than one newer box with say 50 erg


[04/07/2023 12:17 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
In other words. It’s dumb


[04/07/2023 12:17 AM] Bryce#8378
Still over my head... so what can I do to not have the issue?


[04/07/2023 12:17 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
So even if you’re just trying to send some erg it’s selecting a ton of boxes with tokens that were intended to come back as change


[04/07/2023 12:17 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
The only thing you can do sadly is use another wallet like safew and build your own tx manually.


[04/07/2023 12:18 AM] Bryce#8378
So why did the one go through?


[04/07/2023 12:18 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Depends on how many and the type of boxes it selects.


[04/07/2023 12:18 AM] Bryce#8378
So my funds are basically stuck because I have no clue how to do that


[04/07/2023 12:19 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Until nautilus adds some way to let users select individual boxes to be included  yea stuck


[04/07/2023 12:19 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Happened to me last week too


[04/07/2023 12:20 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Worst thing is it’s not even your fault. It’s just how it picks which boxes to include in the tx and dumb luck


[04/07/2023 12:20 AM] Bryce#8378
If I do this, do I have to input my ledger there?


[04/07/2023 12:20 AM] Bryce#8378
Is there a video somewhere I can look at?


[04/07/2023 12:21 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
No you would just creaate the wallet in safew using ledger. Not thenemonic


[04/07/2023 12:21 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Not the seed words


[04/07/2023 12:21 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
The building of tx can be a bit scary. I’m sure there’s a guide out there somewhere. I just don’t have one.


[04/07/2023 12:21 AM] Bryce#8378
Thanks for the help. Sorry, just a bit frustrated/worried right now.


[04/07/2023 12:22 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
You use the safew transaction builder. Have it show you the available boxes and pick one that has just the stuff you want. Then create a change address and then sign.


[04/07/2023 12:22 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
It is a bit overwhelming.


[04/07/2023 12:22 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
But once you do it once it makes sense


[04/07/2023 12:22 AM] Bryce#8378
Yeah, I have no idea what it means lol


[04/07/2023 12:22 AM] Bryce#8378
I just want to send funds lol


[04/07/2023 12:23 AM] Bryce#8378
:raging_mate:


[04/07/2023 12:23 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
I was advocating here last week to add a smarter algorithm to the wallet to select the best match and not just use the oldest


[04/07/2023 12:23 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
I use a hot wallet and just use ledger for long term cold storage


[04/07/2023 12:24 AM] Bryce#8378
Yeah, I didn't know it would be an issue or else I usually do the same. Usually I don't move my money around much at all.


[04/07/2023 12:25 AM] Bryce#8378
Just was in a frantic to pull some funds for emergency but looks like I'm SOL


[04/07/2023 12:25 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
It happened to me and I knew about not having too many tokens. Never expected the wallet to use 50 boxes to build a single 10 erg send lol

{Reactions}
💯 

[04/07/2023 12:26 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Why I had plenty of erg only boxes available


[04/07/2023 12:27 AM] Bryce#8378
In theory, if I try to fill the old boxes by using brute force/guessing, would that work? Lol


[04/07/2023 12:27 AM] Bryce#8378
Or just wasting time. Idek what I'm talking about here lol


[04/07/2023 12:28 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
Not really much you can do besides make your own tx and not rely ont he wallet building it.


[04/07/2023 12:28 AM] FidgetyRat#0000
The wallets want to use older boxes first to help avoid storage rent


[04/07/2023 12:31 AM] Bryce#8378
Okay, makes sense there I guess... but damn, I can't send anything so they're all gonna get charged storage rent


[04/07/2023 12:31 AM] Bryce#8378
I'm being dramatic, and know it'll get worked out.


[04/07/2023 12:32 AM] Bryce#8378
Running to the gym, but I seriously appreciate the input


[04/07/2023 12:36 AM] theta_decay#5677
Frustration aside, you have no need to worry about any assets being at risk as a result of this.


[04/07/2023 12:40 AM] theta_decay#5677
Likely due to sending a smaller amount, so tx build didn't require as many boxes, so you didn't hit the 20 token max as a result.


[04/07/2023 12:43 AM] FlyingPig#0000
Try sending yourself 0.1 erg and 10 tokens.


[04/07/2023 12:44 AM] FlyingPig#0000
Did you at some point send yourself 20+ tokens from a non ledger wallet?


[04/07/2023 12:57 AM] Bryce#8378
I don’t believe so. Maybe close to, but I only did a few tokens/NFTs at a time


[04/07/2023 12:57 AM] Bryce#8378
Out of the wallet or to the wallet?


[04/07/2023 12:57 AM] Bryce#8378
That’s good. Thank you.


[04/07/2023 12:57 AM] FlyingPig#0000

        To the wallet...


[04/07/2023 12:58 AM] Bryce#8378
Not sure I have 10 tokens left in hot wallet to send lol, but I can try


[04/07/2023 12:58 AM] FlyingPig#0000
No!
From your ledger wallet.
..


[04/07/2023 12:59 AM] FlyingPig#0000
> (re @FlyingPig_69 : *No!

        From your ledger wallet to your ledger wallet.


[04/07/2023 1:01 AM] Bryce#8378
So just to be sure, you’re saying try sending .1 erg and 10 tokens to the same wallet, but a different addy? Sorry, hard for me to follow here


[04/07/2023 1:03 AM] FlyingPig#0000
> (re  : *<Bryce> Not sure I have 10 tokens left in hot ...*)
         
        No....
From the ledger address you have 20+ tokens to the very same address.

You need to see if you can renew some of the boxes so that nautilus doesn't pick them (it's complicated to explain).


[04/07/2023 1:06 AM] FlyingPig#0000
So if you first send yourself 0.1 erg and 10 tokens that will create a new box.

After that you can try to send the 100 erg again. If that doesn't work try 50 erg.

This is a really annoying problem with ledger but it will hopefully be fixed at some point.
The problem is that ledger hq insists on all applications to work on their nano s device which has a tiny amount of ram.


[04/07/2023 1:08 AM] FlyingPig#0000
Or you can send 10 tokens to a hot wallet if you want as well.

The key is to renew the boxes or get tokens out of your wallet.


[04/07/2023 1:27 AM] Bryce#8378
Awesome, thanks for trying to help. I’ll try it as soon as I get home and check in afterwards!


[04/07/2023 1:27 AM] capt_nemo#3204
Hey, I'm sorry you are facing this issue, I'm writing a ledger-specific box selector strategy, which will prefer boxes with full or greater amounts and try to avoid many tokens in a single transaction, that will help on your case.

If you don't mind, could you DM me your address so I can, test this feature with real wold scenarios. I'll work on it along this week

I tried this and it didn't seem to work


[04/07/2023 2:20 AM] Bryce#8378
Basically I start with .1 ERG and tried 10 additional tokens, then 9, then 8, then 7 and it still kept failing

> (re  : *<Bryce> Basically I start with .1 ERG and trie...*)
         
        Sorry about that. There will be a combination that works, but without knowing the contents of your wallet it's hard to know.

You have the captain on the case now. They will sort this out for you.

You've been incredibly patient by the way. Many would have shouted and screamed by now :).

Funds are not lost, that's the key here.

I have used a ledger for over a year since it was in alpha mode.
BUT I only use it for storing ERG and some of my ergopad vesting/staking  keys. 

For random tokens etc I use a cold mobile wallet (ergo mobile wallet on an old phone which is in offline mode).

Nautilus v0.7.3 was released with a focus on Ledger UX improvement.

In this release, Nautilus adopts two strategies to avoid or, at least, make the “too many tokens” error less annoying:

1. Utilize a specific input selection strategy to cherry-pick the best inputs to avoid selecting unnecessary assets as inputs.
2. Split the change in one box per distinct asset. This action will optimize input selection for further transactions.

Ok so I tried differently and worked. So what I did was going to the expanding the wallet view(click on wallet icon>click on "expand view") and did the transaction this way. Then the wallet pop-up connection showed up that wasn't showing before. Once I connected tx went through normally

[04/17/2023 12:27 AM] thecolj#0000
It makes me vessle look hobo & challenging to find used tokens. Also, & it’s a big ask - how about drag & drop functionality to order token appearance as one sees fit? 🤞

Burning Tokens
How to burn tokens that you no longer need


[04/17/2023 3:47 AM] jukihu#0000
guys i have question regarding sigmafi.app, let's say if i submit a Loan Request with 1000 SigUSD with 10% interest for 12 months, do i need to:


[04/17/2023 3:47 AM] jukihu#0000
1. pay monthly or as long as before 12 months end, i pay full with 1000 + 100 SigUSD will do?


[04/17/2023 3:48 AM] jukihu#0000
2. how does the collateral % work? is it mean that if collateral drop to 0%, liquidation will be triggered?


[04/17/2023 7:43 AM] cafebedouin#9837
1. You pay all at once.
2. The percent collateral is how much over the amount of the loan, 100%, it has been over-collateralized. For example, if you put in 1000 erg as collateral, and the loan is $1000/SigUSD, then if we say it is a 10 month loan for 10%, or $1100, then this is the denominator. Let's assume $2 Erg, then it's $2,000- fees/$1100 = ~180%.

Liquidation is never triggered. Loan provider can take the collateral once the time on the loan has passed and the loan has not been repaid. The percent of over collateralization should be high enough, say 150%, that the lender would prefer that the borrower defaults.

        No a utxo must have erg in it


[04/18/2023 11:23 AM] HelixEvo#0000
So to burn anything you are paying the fee and burning a little ERG also?


[04/18/2023 11:36 AM] Pulsarz#0000
This address does not burn really


[04/18/2023 11:37 AM] Pulsarz#0000
Its a contract that cant be spent


[04/18/2023 11:37 AM] Pulsarz#0000
So storage rent will take the erg aftef 4 years and possibly the token


[04/18/2023 11:38 AM] Pulsarz#0000
So the erg never gets burned, it goes to the miners after 4 years


[04/18/2023 11:38 AM] Pulsarz#0000
But yes need a small amount of erg for a box to be able to exist


[04/18/2023 11:39 AM] Pulsarz#0000
Actual burning of tokens is possible using other ways but erg cannot be burned at all


[04/18/2023 12:32 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Spending Erg. It's not possible to burn it.

Is there any scenario you can think of where installing something like a vpn could lead to malware that compromises the nautilus wallet?


[04/26/2023 12:48 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Is it possible? Yes. Anytime you install software you are trusting a program to not compromise your system. At minimum, it would require exfiltrating the encrypted mnemonic string and brute forcing the password. There's already a tool to help do this decrypting, i.e., https://github.com/mgpai22/nautilus-ergo-wallet-decrypter

[04/26/2023 12:50 PM] cafebedouin#9837
So, if this is something that worries you, use SAFEW with Ergopay. If you use a decent sized spending password, say 20+ characters, it shouldn't be a problem, but even there, someone could use a keylogger.


[04/26/2023 12:56 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042

Hey @capt_nemo , I'm working on some display improvements so that the user is less confused once they see a lot of unrelated tokens in a transaction breakdown. Do you have any feedback to this solution? Not sure if this is needed for all transactions or just some more advanced (contract interactions, multiwitness, ...)?

I'd like to get #90 merged into `add_sign_inputs` first (change handling) before I make a PR for this. Would you be able to review #90 anytime soon by any chance? It's just a very small PR.

Wow, that would be an awesome UX improvement, we need to work on tx interpreter to correctly detect some edge cases, like when you have change to a contract, for example. Sounds like a great start, for sure!

On PR #90, I saw that, just didn't time to check yet. Will review in a few hours. 🙂

So awesome to see SigmaFi popping off, TVL mustve doubled in the last like 3 days. And I'm pretty sure SigmaFi is the reason SigUSD is trading 5%+ above peg, will drive some SigUSD issuance once ergo goes up another few % (395% collateralized atm). Just awesome all around

Seems like loaning sigUSD vs ERG is similar to selling a put. 

Loaning ERG vs sigUSD is similar to selling a call

So i would guess the other side is similar to buying each?

        For the lender, yes. That's how I look at it.


[04/30/2023 4:51 AM] theta_decay#0000
(re @anon1111 : *Seems like loaning sigUSD vs ERG is similar to...*)
        
        For the borrower, it really depends on what they do with the borrowed funds.


[04/30/2023 4:53 AM] theta_decay#0000
If they sit on the borrowed funds & wait to see what happens then I see it as you describe.


[04/30/2023 4:54 AM] theta_decay#0000
But if they redeploy the borrowed funds, that becomes a different trade altogether.

[04/30/2023 5:32 AM] gg#0000
on the contrary, if the price of Ergo dumps, borrower will return you a totally devalued loan


[04/30/2023 2:10 PM] anon1111#0000
(re @gg : *If you loan your Ergs against sigUSD as collat...*)
        
        If its collateralized 120% for example, then its like selling a call with a strike price 20% higher than spot. If ERG doesnt go up at least 20%, the borrower is incentivized to repay the ERG to reclaim the sigUSD. So you end up with a yield and all your erg back. If erg goes up more than 20% your gains are capped at the 20% over-collateralization since they probably wont pay back the erg. Thats all very similar to selling a covered call


[04/30/2023 5:22 PM] anon1111#0000
Seems logical to me that SigmaFi interest rates and collateral requirements will trend toward an "implied volatility" percentage, as these loans function more like option contracts. Is anyone worried this will crowd out more "legitimate"/traditional loans, since interest rates will be too high?


[04/30/2023 5:30 PM] gg#0000
That my point, APY should be according to volatility, I wouldn't lend my Ergs for even 50% Apy when it can make 1000% in a couple of years


[04/30/2023 6:40 PM] cafebedouin#9837
To some extent but then again, SigmaFi requires a lot more cognitive overhead than duckpools. Simplicity has a market too.
