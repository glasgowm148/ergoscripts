@nemo429 any plans for a small explanation / quick start page?


[03/15/2023 6:50 PM] Pulsarz#0000
I myself now have the question in what the interest is paid in, in the token that is lent right? But for a noob it's not really clear just from looking at the site imo

Finally getting a chance to try out @Sigmafi_app. 

Used 2 #ErgoNFTs (an @enigmaNFTs and a @maritsaart)  as collateral for a 7-day 50 $ERG loan @ 5% interest.

Really neat that NFTs can be used as collateral on this lending app.

 They are revamping their backend and it should be available soon.

[03/16/2023 5:17 PM] cryptoquokka#0000
There is one way you can get it without us implementing an API. We have a GraphQL endpoint that you can literally do everything with lol

If you don’t want to wait a couple weeks I can get on a call and show it

Minnow fullfilled the loan request. Very clean dashboard that makes it easy to see whats what


[03/16/2023 5:19 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
But yes, trust is the biggest roadblock to larger adoption using NFTs

[03/16/2023 5:22 PM] cryptoquokka#0000

(re @cryptoquokka : *https://hasura.skyharbor.io/v1/graphql*) 
 
 So, are verified minting addresses under `mint_addresses`?


[03/16/2023 6:32 PM] cryptoquokka#0000
(re @nemo429 : *So, are verified minting addresses under mint_addresses?*) 
 
 Best way to get verified mint addresses is to call via collections, mint_addresses just stores all address, even unverified


[03/16/2023 6:33 PM] cryptoquokka#0000
You could get all mint addresses and filter out all p2pk collection names


[03/16/2023 6:33 PM] cryptoquokka#0000
but this is the best way I think:
query verifiedMintAddresses {
  collections(where:{verified: {_eq:true}}) {
    name
    mint_addresses{
      address
    }
  }
}


[03/16/2023 6:34 PM] cryptoquokka#0000
Or you can query the address directly, one sec while I make a query for that


[03/16/2023 6:36 PM] cryptoquokka#0000
here:

```
query verifiedMintAddresses {
  collections(where: {_and: {verified: {_eq: true}, mint_addresses: {address: {_eq: mintAddress}}}}) {
    name
    mint_addresses {
      address
    }
  }
}```


[03/16/2023 6:36 PM] cryptoquokka#0000
If it returns anything then it is verified :)


[03/16/2023 6:36 PM] cryptoquokka#0000
Actually, using Hasura I could probably make an API endpoints for this that doesn't require graphql. I'll get back to you on that


[03/16/2023 6:44 PM] cryptoquokka#0000
Lol this is sick, I didn't think it would be that easy. The reason I didn't want to do this is so we have one API root URL (https://skyharbor-server.net)

But I'm way better at graphql so I might just have to do a mix of both
Here's the API endpoint for mint address: https://hasura.skyharbor.io/api/rest/verified/address/:mintaddress


[03/16/2023 6:44 PM] cryptoquokka#0000
Example with Cybercitizen: https://hasura.skyharbor.io/api/rest/verified/address/9hfNCyqJsCSku8HXrV17Y6AaQciCAwkwx4M49imdWjRaTX22Mvz


[03/16/2023 6:48 PM] cryptoquokka#0000
I guess I could just return the name, not the mint address, thats all the proof needed to know its verified. One good thing about not using gql is that we can edit what we return.

Anyways, if you want me to add more to the endpoint lmk. I'm assuming you're going to stick with graphql bc you're a beast at that, so pls dont let me stop you

[03/20/2023 4:52 AM] NoahErgo#0000
what? No, the 2.4% just means that 2.4% of the term length has been completed


[03/20/2023 4:53 AM] NoahErgo#0000
interest is included in the shown repayment amount


[03/20/2023 4:54 AM] NoahErgo#0000

take the repayment amount and subtract the amount you lendt and that is your interest amount


[03/20/2023 5:00 AM] NoahErgo#0000
do the math on the term length


[03/20/2023 5:02 AM] manhtunguyen73#0000

@nemo429 let me know when you use the verified mint address API. Would be a cool feature IMO since I'm seeing more NFTs show up on SigmaFi, and would be good promo for our API. 

It's funny bc I had a Cardano project tell me they could make an NFT p2p lending system on Ergo for $50k funding, when it was already built (SigmaFi) but not advertised for NFTs 😂

[03/21/2023 4:05 PM] NoahErgo#0000

 Probably doable, but useless since anybody can just make a new wallet address


[03/21/2023 4:08 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
(re @K : *Probably doable, but useless since anybody can just make a new wallet address*) 
 
 True, but could also keep track of those that have fulfilled obligations to create a trust factor


[03/21/2023 4:09 PM] NoahErgo#0000
so you mean some kind of credit score


[03/21/2023 4:09 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Possibly


[03/21/2023 4:09 PM] K#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *K maybe i want to borrow equal amounts of erg and sigusd so i can deposit lp*) 
 
 This is a good idea, it will likely come in a later and bigger update though since it requires changes to the actual bond contracts.


[03/21/2023 4:09 PM] K#0000
(re @sisyphuspush : *True, but could also keep track of those that have fulfilled obligations to create a trust factor*) 
 
 I was hoping for ErgoNames to come out for something like a credit score to be allowed.

 Partly my fault, they were very close to mvp but I recommended they go for an AVL Tree design which was more decentralized than what they originally had. Likely delayed them a little bit 😅

(re @cryptoquokka : *@nemo429 let me know when you use the verified mint address API. Would be a cool feature IMO since I'm seeing more NFTs show up on SigmaFi, and would be good promo for our API. 

It's funny bc I had a Cardano project tell me they could make an NFT p2p lending system on Ergo for $50k funding, when it was already built (SigmaFi) but not advertised for NFTs 😂*) 
 
 Sure! Jumping on it )


[03/21/2023 10:24 PM] nemo429#0000
Damn, getting the minting address is really inefficient, will try to optimize that on graphql side

 Preview background look nice. Will it only work if there is 1 NFT as collateral?

Hey can anyone confirm for me answers to these questions? @NoahErgo maybe?

1) under what conditions can the lender claim the collateral?

2)What happens if the collateral ratio drops below 100%? Can they claim it early?

3) after the term expires, can the lender liquidate/claim all of the collateral (even if it’s >100%?), or is only up to 100% of the loan + interest owing?

TY!

 1 - if loan payback time has passed and the borrower has not paid it back. 
2 - nope, unlike duckpools it doesn’t matter. Only trigger for enabling liquidation is expiry time. 
3- for liquidation, lender gets whatever was presented as collateral in beginning. For payback option, lender gets original back plus interest.


[03/28/2023 2:37 PM] gg#0000
About 1) , how much time after the expiration lender can claim the collateral?


[03/28/2023 2:59 PM] qx()#0000
i believe as aoon as it reaches/passes the block height that is designated as the timer it will allow you to hit that liquidate button.


[03/28/2023 2:59 PM] qx()#0000
but i'm not 100% sure of that


[03/28/2023 3:21 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Is it possible for the borrower to have option to pay the interest into SC at time of loan request, essentially providing more collateral incentive for lender?

(re @sisyphuspush : *Is it possible for the borrower to have option to pay the interest into SC at time of loan request, essentially providing more collateral incentive for lender?*) 
 
 Yes, but I think in your case example there is now opportunity if you repay the loan early you are only charged the partial interest of time of the actual loan, that’s why it’s collected during repayment. Whoever is awake feel free to correct but I’m sure that would be the next push/request.


[03/28/2023 4:23 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
(re @dadreboi : *Yes, but I think in this case if you repay the loan early you are only charged the partial interest of time of the actual loan, that’s why it’s collected during repayment. Whoever is awake feel free to correct.*) 
 
 From my testing, it charged full interest even if paid back early

 Thats what he is saying

I see...read that wrong


[03/28/2023 4:24 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
But why only pay partial interest if default is full, regardless of how early its paid back?


[03/28/2023 4:25 PM] qx()#0000
No interest on default


[03/28/2023 4:25 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
True..but assuming it is paid back


[03/28/2023 4:25 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Full interest is charged regardless if its early or not, correct?


[03/28/2023 4:26 PM] qx()#0000
Collecting interest at beginning could mean less leverage for borrower.


[03/28/2023 4:26 PM] qx()#0000

 Howso?


[03/28/2023 4:28 PM] qx()#0000
Means u would jump out during small fluxes in price when ur payback is less than the interest accrued so far.


[03/28/2023 4:29 PM] qx()#0000
Eventually lenders would be pissed getting not full term interest


[03/28/2023 4:29 PM] qx()#0000
And just stop lending


[03/28/2023 4:30 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Lets assume interest is paid in full based on loan request timeline, as I'm still assuming this is currently the case, and its more of a guarantee like the collateral.


[03/28/2023 4:30 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I think would have to work like this:

Interest is put up in full at loan creation. If person repays loan early, percentage of interest is taken based on interval of time. The rest remains on sigmafi to be claimed back by loan requester


[03/28/2023 4:31 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I suppose if this is a possibility then there should be an option for minimum duration beyond which early repayment is possible


[03/28/2023 4:32 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Otherwise makes taking a loan less attractive


[03/28/2023 4:32 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *I think would have to work like this:

 Makes sense...could even see it similar to mortgage where interest is frontloaded and not distributed equally along timeframe


[03/28/2023 4:32 PM] qx()#0000
Contract only allows persons to send to others if im not mistaken? As in, the borrower can only send payment and interest at once, the lender can only liquidate and take collateral. As Noah said, if interest was also collected at first, during liquidation the borrower would also have to come back to collect the interest


[03/28/2023 4:33 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Maybe I need another coffee...


[03/28/2023 4:33 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000

Prob just cleaner this way tbh


[03/28/2023 4:34 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I think an option for minimum duration before repayment is essential if this is inplemented


[03/28/2023 4:34 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
In my test, I paid back early...but was charged full interest


[03/28/2023 4:34 PM] NoahErgo#0000
So lets say 2 month loan. minimum 1 month and then second month can be repaid at any time.


[03/28/2023 4:34 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Thats is how its currently set up to work, correct?


[03/28/2023 4:34 PM] NoahErgo#0000
(re @sisyphuspush : *Thats is how its currently set up to work, correct?*) 
 
 Yes you pay back all of the interest you specified at loan creation


[03/28/2023 4:34 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
Okay...good...not completely lost here


[03/28/2023 4:35 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000

[03/28/2023 4:36 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Personally, I'm happy to pay full interest to close out the loan. The person offering the loan is locked in. The person taking it has a lot of flexibility, and that flexibility should cone with a cost.

[03/28/2023 4:37 PM] NoahErgo#0000
but i do think having it as an option could be useful if implemented with minimum term before repayment, beyond which early repayment is possible


[03/28/2023 4:37 PM] qx()#0000
(re @dadreboi : *Only the lender can*) 
 
 Lender can’t sign the repayment/interest tax either only borrower


[03/28/2023 4:37 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Complexity has a cost too.


[03/28/2023 4:37 PM] cafebedouin#9837

[03/28/2023 4:38 PM] qx()#0000
So at the end, if interest is collected first….the lender has to sign he liquidate tx, and NOW the borrower has to sign the get back the interest tx


[03/28/2023 4:38 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Until the lending and borrowing pools are larger, at any rate.


[03/28/2023 4:38 PM] qx()#0000
In current method that doesn’t need to happen and is cleaner


[03/28/2023 4:38 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I wouldn't take a loan with interest front loaded.


[03/28/2023 4:38 PM] qx()#0000

1) Safety. You get guaranteed return on your Erg and token and don't think about the market.

 And hedging


[03/28/2023 4:41 PM] cafebedouin#9837
2) You think the market is going to roll a certain way, and you think that if you borrow something now, change it, you'll be able to pay back, cheaper, later when price is lower and cover the interest rate.


[03/28/2023 4:41 PM] Sisyphuspush#0000
As a potential lender knowing interest isn't guaranteed makes me pause...I guess that's where it comes from


[03/28/2023 4:41 PM] cafebedouin#9837

 Correct, always need to be ok with the collateral


[03/28/2023 4:41 PM] qx()#0000
Just like any other loan


[03/28/2023 4:43 PM] cafebedouin#9837
It's a great tool. For example, right now I'm writing loans so I can add to the AHT/Erg liquidity pool. I borrow the erg change some to AHT and dump in pool. I can keep the SigUSD, used as collateral, and likely, I'll be able to pay back the Erg more cheaply in a few months.


[03/28/2023 4:44 PM] cafebedouin#9837
On the other end, they don't have to take all that risk. Guaranteed 3% or 4%.


[03/28/2023 4:44 PM] cafebedouin#9837
I'm happy to pay that, particularly if it plays the way I think it will.

 Keep in mind a few things:

- On the UI, 100% collateralization means the collateral covers the loan AND the interest.
- The goal of the SigmaFi contracts in general is to be simple as possible, so I am trying to avoid unnecessary changes.

 Maybe the better way of stating is that the collateral (assuming >= 100%) covers the interest payment. So if the loan never ends up being repaid, you are not losing out on the total value of the interest + loan.

 … at the time the loan is taken out.

This doesn’t account for change in asset value / exchange rate over the term though, so the lender can still be caught short.

This should incentivise lenders to preferentially accept stable-assets as collateral.


[03/28/2023 10:43 PM] qx()#0000
Interesting. Could offset as a borrower by providing collateral in erg and then interest in sigusd to make it more enticing to be picked up. But goes the other way too if erg price rises. But in that loan if erg prices go up I’m gonna default on purpose anyway.

 Yes, this is assuming value of everything remains stable for simplicity purposes. If value changes, then it gets more complicated.

[03/30/2023 11:52 AM] BiBibouxx#0000
Since I moved tokens to my wallet some time ago, the bond no longer appears on the dashboard. Moreover, I believe that the bond was due to expire on March 22 and I did not see anything on my wallet.
Sorry if bad English because I am French and I use the automatic translator.

        If you missed the expiration then the lender probably liquidated it and you won’t see anything now on dashboard


[03/30/2023 12:11 PM] qx()#0000
You have to pay back before expiration.


[03/30/2023 12:12 PM] BiBibouxx#0000
I was the lender


[03/30/2023 12:12 PM] qx()#0000
Oh!!


[03/30/2023 12:12 PM] qx()#0000
And you didn’t see your funds come back?


[03/30/2023 12:12 PM] qx()#0000
If they paid back you’ll see a tx in your wallet with that original lent amount plus interest.


[03/30/2023 12:12 PM] BiBibouxx#0000
No, still not and I believe that the duration of the obligation was 1 month. But I can't check it now because I don't see anything on the dashboard

> (re @dadreboi : *If they paid back you’ll see a tx in your wallet with that original lent amount plus interest.*)
         
        Always nothing


[03/30/2023 12:12 PM] qx()#0000
The contracts use wallet address so moving tokens shouldn’t matter. You’re using nautilus? What’s the address?


[03/30/2023 12:13 PM] BiBibouxx#0000
A moins d'avoir mal vu sur ergoexplorer... C'est pas evident pour les novises. J'utilise Nautilus mon adresse est 9fkeYFLgSE2mSN3zh921ZAWga5tr9tqggZdjdryAgtwvN6TkHUt


[03/30/2023 12:13 PM] BiBibouxx#0000
Unless you saw the wrong thing on ergoexplorer... It's not easy for novices. I use Nautilus my address is 9fkeYFLgSE2mSN3zh921ZAWga5tr9tqggZdjdryAgtwvN6TkHUt Sorry^^


[03/30/2023 12:15 PM] BiBibouxx#0000
The initial transaction on ergo explorer is b7f8f4804241113c638e0c6b5d82ae35e5b568c2b65faba64a5e370718c31a3f

@nemo429 can you pay stuff back after expiry if it hasn't been liquidated yet?

I can’t lend it says something like dapp connector error

        Okies. Ty for clearing that up :)


[03/31/2023 1:13 PM] nemo429#0000
> (re @kushti_ru : *with SafeW*)
         
        SAFEW has an issue with big integers, already pinged the dev, see: https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/669989266478202917/1072117812962787388


[03/31/2023 1:14 PM] nemo429#0000
It uses regular `number` type instead of `bigint` or something else


[03/31/2023 1:16 PM] kushti#0000
is unknown error about that ?


[03/31/2023 1:17 PM] kushti#0000
previously safew worked

        might be interesting to mint a lender/borrower nft so that people can still move wallets


[03/31/2023 1:18 PM] Pulsarz#0000
or was this by design?


[03/31/2023 1:24 PM] qx()#0000
So allow any key to sign it as long as originating nft is in that wallet? Would also allow for selling the loan easier, which they have talked about.


[03/31/2023 1:53 PM] nemo429#0000
> (re @kushti_ru : *is unknown error about that ?*)
         
        It’s possible, it’s the only know issue with SAFEW dApp connector. When you get this error again, can you hit F12 and see what’s going on in the browser log?


[03/31/2023 1:54 PM] nemo429#0000

        That’s interesting, K sir, what do you think about that? Feasible?


[03/31/2023 1:54 PM] Pulsarz#0000
not sure if it's possible for the lender tbh since they automatically get the amount paid back by the borrower


[03/31/2023 1:55 PM] nemo429#0000
> (re @Pulsarzz : *not sure if it's possible for the lender tbh s...*)
         
        It can go the the NFT holder as well


[03/31/2023 1:56 PM] Pulsarz#0000
> (re @nemo429 : *It can go the the NFT holder as well*)
         
        yeah but then the nft doesn't get burned


[03/31/2023 1:56 PM] Pulsarz#0000
not that it matters, butr not as organized


[03/31/2023 1:56 PM] Pulsarz#0000
the nft the borrower had would be burned when repaying the loan, makes sense


[03/31/2023 1:56 PM] Pulsarz#0000
also extra reminder he has outstanding loans to pay


[03/31/2023 1:59 PM] Pulsarz#0000
this would basically enable leverage if you think about it


[03/31/2023 1:59 PM] Pulsarz#0000
since you could use the nft's as collateral on a new loan


[03/31/2023 2:00 PM] nemo429#0000
> (re @kushti_ru : *is unknown error about that ?*)
         
        Also, it works well until you have a box with big enough amounts.

        TVL takes time to update. It should have jumped


[03/31/2023 6:39 PM] RichiTP#0000
Or maybe it goes up upon new loan requests only. Not sure


[03/31/2023 6:41 PM] nemo429#0000
TVL is the sum of all assets locked into open orders and ongoing loans


[03/31/2023 6:42 PM] RichiTP#0000
Yes, I thought it should have gone up for a sec, but of course it makes sense now

[04/17/2023 9:04 PM] cometeer#0000
In another platform I used, the lender have the option to cease the collateral if it is under 100%, but it can be malicious, especially with unreliable price oracle or flash loan attacks.


[04/18/2023 7:07 PM] Pulsarz#0000
SigmaFi tracking added to ErgoMonitor. If there is interest I could post all new overcollaterized loan requests to this channel if @ErgoMonitor_bot gets added. Makes more sense here then a separate channel imo.

Hey question- 

How important is it to use a cold wallet for using sigmafi?

Depends on your preferences. A cold wallet is more secure, but Sigmafi is more convenient with Nautilus. In fact, I think a cold wallet with Sigmafi would require SafeW, and doing a tx would be rather convoluted.

[04/23/2023 12:15 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Capt isn't keen on Ergo pay, because it requires a centralized back end. If you want to use Ergo pay with Sigmafi, I think the choice would be SafeW, scan QR with hot wallet, sign with cold. I haven't tried it with Sigmafi, but I would suspect that's how it could be done.

(re  : *<cafebedouin> Capt isn't keen on Ergo pay, bec...*)
        
        That's what I try to do (SAFEW + QR), but it fails to generate it


[04/23/2023 12:16 AM] velvia695#0000
I know the SAFEW dev made a solution, but no clear instructions on how to do it


[04/23/2023 12:17 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Then, the problem is the QR code. There are constraints on QR size and it isn't enough for Sigmafi transactions.


[04/23/2023 12:17 AM] cafebedouin#9837
You can click on the QR and it will display a larger one.


[04/23/2023 12:18 AM] velvia695#0000
Not if it fails to generate


[04/23/2023 12:18 AM] cafebedouin#9837
But, in this case, it isn't displaying because it Bork's on the initial construction.


[04/23/2023 12:18 AM] velvia695#0000
Yeah


[04/23/2023 12:20 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Yeah, I think I talked to capt about this issue during beta testing. This is exactly the problem Ergopay is designed to solve. The QR points to the Ergopay back end, which then builds the tx and not the QR itself.

plus smart contract would have to have an oracle feed of the price of any possible token

        It's really shit, I'm hoping yield farming will give us a decent boost in liquidity but being completely real here, the only way to solve the issue is for ERG to go up in price, if ERG does a 10x that price impact is 0.3% which is a whole lot better

[04/29/2023 11:03 AM] Gazza_SP#0000
This is probably not exactly how it would play out realistically with people selling for profit and all that but it's clear that ERG price going up is what is really need to make the current liquidity worth more rather than relying on new injections of liquidity which is difficult to predict


[04/29/2023 11:04 AM] Gazza_SP#0000

[04/29/2023 1:52 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Strangely, SigRSV returns are a function of SigUSD. If you incentivize SigUSD that should roll into SigRSV as a secondary effect.


[04/29/2023 1:53 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Still need price increase, but the more SigUSD minted at these prices, the better it will be for SigRSV holders.

Right. Either need increase in price or increase of SigRSV, when ratio is below 400%.

(re @velvia695 : *They can't mint if reserve ratio is bad, no?*)
        
        You can usually buy on spectrum at a reasonable ratio, but an increase in demand will lead to more minting when it’s above RR

I made the api but was not enough afaik


[04/29/2023 5:37 PM] wombo22#5461
ya they dont seem to accept adaptors using api calls


[04/29/2023 5:38 PM] wombo22#5461
they said "I suggest submitting the PR and making your case there. Perhaps you could even help us discover a method to track the TVL on-chain for Ergo"


[04/29/2023 5:38 PM] wombo22#5461
not sure if Noah submitted it or not

        i went into discord of defillama as they are no longer accepting new api adaptors, they want integrated sdk adaptors. They told me maybe try submitting an API one anyway since ergo is not part of their sdk


[04/29/2023 9:49 PM] NoahErgo#0000
havent gotten around to it


[04/30/2023 12:10 AM] Pulsarz#0000
@nemo429 not sure if you saw my question on if it would be possible to direct link to an order/bond on the site? would be nice if I could simply provide the boxid and the correct popup opens or something


[04/30/2023 12:11 AM] Pulsarz#0000
telegram alert -> insta open sigmafi popup and accept the order for example


[04/30/2023 12:11 AM] qx()#0000
makes for faster sniping in the future too


[04/30/2023 12:11 AM] hq3r#0000

no, nvm, it's showing CMC prices


[04/30/2023 12:14 AM] hq3r#0000
We could trigure that... To indentify the order but sigmafi has to implement into a frontend too

UI uses boxid internally as well


[04/30/2023 12:15 AM] qx()#0000
no, it's ageusd bank or oracle price

        the site or what?


[04/30/2023 12:15 AM] Pulsarz#0000
when I wass testing tvl matches very close to my api tvl that uses coingecko pricing


[04/30/2023 12:15 AM] qx()#0000
yeah the site...as erg price changes loans will fall out of collateral before being picked up

let borrowerCount = {};

data.forEach(item => {
  let borrower = item['borrower'];

  if (borrowerCount[borrower]) {
    borrowerCount[borrower].count++;

console.log(borrowerCount);


[04/30/2023 12:23 AM] hq3r#0000
I think this should work for total borrowed


[04/30/2023 1:16 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Curb has a less than one year old at home. Also, less focused on Ergo and more on cross chain. I haven't talked to him in a month, but I'm planning on doing some updates to sigmabot, so I'll talk with him when I push the PR. If you don't reach out direct, anything you want me to mention?


[04/30/2023 3:01 AM] bennyk2#0000
$134k… now we’re cooking!


[04/30/2023 4:59 AM] qx()#0000
hey capt, can the ongoing loans page show the APY?


[04/30/2023 8:53 PM] Murdoch#8913
Is it a known issue that trying to offer a loan using a offline Android wallet to sign the transaction via SAFEW fails due to QR code generated from sigmafi side being too large? Is it possible to generate multiple QR codes similar to Ergo Wallet, or output the non-image output to transfer to the read only wallet manually?

Also when using browser debugger to extract the ergopay payload that was being used for QR code generation and pasting that data into Ergo Wallet for signing, the inputs and outputs in the boxes look correct but signing fails due to the script output reducing to false.

Any known workarounds to providing a loan while using an offline wallet?


[05/01/2023 1:44 AM] cafebedouin#9837
You could use web browser with SafeW, hot read only Android wallet and a cold off-line android wallet.


[05/01/2023 2:03 AM] Murdoch#8913
I think that's what I was trying which resulted in the failure.

I installed SafeW and added in the hot read only address. Connected the wallet to Sigmafi and then attempted to provide a loan.

It resulted in an error that the QR code is too large, so the hot read only wallet had nothing to read.

I tried to pass in the raw data to the hot read only wallet using Chrome debugger to see if that would be a successful workaround. The hot wallet transaction looked valid, seemed to have all the loan/borrow details, etc. Theb I scanned the transaction from hot wallet into the cold wallet.

Cold wallet then failed signing the transaction, stating that the script reduced to false.


[05/01/2023 2:29 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Right. I forget that these transactions are too large for the signing QR. This is the problem Ergopay is designed to solve.


[05/01/2023 2:55 AM] Murdoch#8913
Ah ok, thanks - maybe I will just experiment with a pure hot wallet on much smaller loan amounts then until it's fixed


[05/01/2023 3:43 AM] NoahErgo#0000
something seems suspicious about the last few loans

The loans were 1600 with 40% interest for 1600 Erg collateral. Repayment in UI shows principal plus interest

(re @NoahErgo : *is it possible the ui is incorrect? Looking at...*)
        
        Looks to me like the first loan was received, swapped into ERG on spectrum for around ~975 ERG, then used in conjunction with additional ERG to collateralize the second order. The 2nd and 3rd loans (3200 SIGUSD) have remained untouched since being received.

Ergopay requires a centralized server, which Nemo doesn't much like and is not eager to set one up.

Could this Sigmafi be looked at as some sort of gambling bet?


[05/01/2023 10:05 AM] HelixEvo#0000
If someone lends 1000SigUSD for collateral of 1.5k ERG. If ERG bombs, then the borrower just defaults on the loan.


[05/01/2023 10:06 AM] HelixEvo#0000
Then they pick up their 1.5k ERG for say 200 SigUSD on the market


[05/01/2023 11:11 AM] velvia695#0000
That's a possibility
