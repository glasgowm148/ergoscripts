Hi there!


[08/03/2020 8:43 PM] mx#5165
Hello, channel should be good to go, let`s welcome @Robert K to foundation officially @kushti @morphic @Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ


[08/03/2020 8:44 PM] kushti#0978
Welcome aboard @Robert K !


[08/03/2020 8:48 PM] Robert K#0722
Thank you, glad to be a part of the Foundation.


[08/03/2020 8:59 PM] mx#5165
"Robert KToday at 21:49
Alright cool, so it seems we'll be getting a paid marketing push behind the Oracle Pools public release.
So hopefully we can get some good traction/eyes on Oracle Pools/Ergo.
No specific date yet (we're being flexible for now), but it does seem like a good idea to pursue creating the website/public frontend for this release as well."


[08/03/2020 9:00 PM] mx#5165
Sounds great, i guess DeadIT can help with the website also if needed @kushti, could be eventually a grant


[08/03/2020 9:01 PM] kushti#0978
yes sure


[08/03/2020 9:01 PM] kushti#0978
so a website or a special section on Ergo or Emurgo website? (or both?)


[08/03/2020 9:05 PM] mx#5165
I guess new one linking to both, then it represents serious product, it will be first serious marketing campaign for Ergo i think so whatever can be improved @Robert K with Ergo`s grants or some skills please say about it, there will be private subforum shortly for such proposals, the existing marketing squad will be rather helping with pushing things in their own way


[08/03/2020 9:06 PM] Robert K#0722
We had no current plan for exactly where we'd host it/what domain we'd use for this website/front-end.


[08/03/2020 9:06 PM] Robert K#0722
It probably wouldn't go on Emurgo's main website, as it already has too many pages so it was a bit of a question.


[08/03/2020 9:09 PM] mx#5165
Ergo doesn`t have such problem yet üôÇ so can be also a subpage @kushti


[08/03/2020 9:12 PM] Robert K#0722
What would be great help would be creating the front-end for displaying oracle pool stats/info.


[08/03/2020 9:13 PM] mx#5165
As for me, DeadIT would be the best for this job at the moment, he can probably combine it also with explorer


[08/03/2020 9:17 PM] mx#5165
like order book for DEX etc, also he has done website's design above optimizing eplorer`s frontend so no other candidate really


[08/03/2020 9:18 PM] Robert K#0722
Hmm, this is actually a pretty interesting idea. Maybe we could build this out so that we can show off this Erg/USD oracle pool, but also have potential for other Oracle Pools to be listed on the website as well?


[08/03/2020 9:18 PM] Robert K#0722
Since Oracle Pools can be used by anyone via data-inputs, they act as public goods essentially. It'd be cool to have a catalogue/public registry of pools which people can submit to.


[08/03/2020 9:19 PM] mx#5165
yes sure


[08/03/2020 9:19 PM] Robert K#0722
To start, we can just display our single nanoErg/USD pool, but maybe later on make it open?

[08/03/2020 9:20 PM] Robert K#0722
And for UI, @kushti linked this earlier, and it may be worth forking something like https://github.com/swarmpit/ethstats for the front-end.

[08/03/2020 9:28 PM] kushti#0978
So explorer will show oracle data ?


[08/03/2020 9:29 PM] Robert K#0722
I think it's not a bad place to put it, it makes it very easy for everyone in the ecosystem to find.


[08/03/2020 9:30 PM] Robert K#0722
And if we build it out into a registry of sorts, it could be a good way for people to find all the Oracle Pools/their NFT ID so they can be used.


[08/03/2020 9:30 PM] mx#5165
yes, explorer is also fully open source


[08/03/2020 9:35 PM] kushti#0978
Yes, makes sense


[08/03/2020 9:36 PM] kushti#0978
Is it needed for a public release ?


[08/03/2020 9:38 PM] Robert K#0722
Sorry, is what needed?


[08/03/2020 9:39 PM] mx#5165
@kushti if we want to reach every user with marketing campaign, i would say yes


[08/03/2020 9:39 PM] kushti#0978
explorer page


[08/03/2020 9:40 PM] Robert K#0722
The registry part I think can be done later, but the visual front-end for at least our single nanoErg/USD pool, I think yes.


[08/03/2020 9:40 PM] kushti#0978
backend service then also needed likely


[08/03/2020 9:40 PM] kushti#0978
lemme talk with the guys in my morning


[08/03/2020 9:41 PM] Robert K#0722
Alright sounds good. Worst case we can do it front-end only, make an oracle core connector that has an open API, and in the JS just ping a single oracle and relay data about the current state of the pool.


[08/03/2020 9:41 PM] Robert K#0722
Rather than from each oracle and require a backend to keep things in check.


[08/03/2020 9:42 PM] Robert K#0722
But yeah, we can talk about what makes the most sense for a 2-3 week timeline. Truthfully we just need something that looks good and shows enough detail to make people understand stuff is happening.

[08/21/2020 10:16 AM] kushti#0978
sorry for the delay (


[08/21/2020 4:32 PM] Robert K#0722
Would we be comfortable with moving the Foundation's funds into the distributed sig dApp that anon made? This would allow us to claim that the Ergo Foundation is using a Zero Knowledge Treasury, and have an on-chain process for receiving grant proposals which sounds like a really great marketing angle.


[08/21/2020 4:34 PM] Robert K#0722
Obviously we'd need to do a lot of inspection of the contracts (maybe formally verify them too) + the off-chain code to 100% guarantee everything is safe, but I think this would be great for getting people excited about the tech and opening up the grant proposal process as well.


[08/21/2020 4:34 PM] Robert K#0722
(Imo we need to use the advancements we're making more in direct ways that are public to people and seem like super unique selling points that no one else is doing in the space)

[08/23/2020 12:47 PM] kushti#0978
DevFund is protected by a contract slowly releasing Ergs, and Ergs spent also protected via privacy-preserving threshold signature (2-out-of-3, with keys of mine, catena, and @morphic ), and the protection condition can be updated, so hopefully after some tests we can include more signers.


[08/23/2020 12:47 PM] kushti#0978
There are some unlocked funds we can move now into Zero Knowledge Treasury for grants


[08/23/2020 12:48 PM] kushti#0978
DevFund still holds 2.6+M ergs (~90% locked), with current rate even it is not that bad, we can speed up development definitely IMHO


[08/24/2020 2:40 PM] Robert K#0722
Sounds good, maybe the Ergo Foundation can make this a more explicit public initiative where we're "becoming more open" by having a public on-chain mechanism for grants, and we as the EF submit funds to the EF ZK Treasury in tranches.


[08/24/2020 2:43 PM] Robert K#0722
This means that at any give moment there's X Ergs available to be dealt out, but we can refill the ZK Treasury at will. This means we aren't locked into having 100% of all rewards go into the ZK Treasury & require grants to proceed (since we may need exchange listings for example), and we can make a public announcement every time we deposit say 100k Ergs into the ZK Treasury, and use the angle that we are pushing to support ecosystem development by the community for the community via these funds we are dedicating by putting them in the ZK Treasury.


[08/24/2020 2:45 PM] Robert K#0722
And then we can probably milk some marketing press from this, because we can announce every quarter or half year that "Ergo Foundation has just dedicated 250k Ergs to their ZK Treasury to help spur community initiatives to build the ecosystem!"


[08/24/2020 2:46 PM] Robert K#0722
And in that way we milk the catchy name "ZK Treausry" get people excited that more funds are available for building the ecosystem, we get more attention for Ergo with potential news articles, and users already understand how to get access to such funds via the public grant process.


[08/25/2020 12:09 AM] kushti#0978
@Robert K sounds right. Ergo Foundation is currently not selling itself and grants very good, so with ZK treasury this can be done a bit better. Maybe after oracle pools release marketing team should sell ZK Treasury and EF doing experiments with it.

We have anon_real and likely also another guy willing to do news apps on Ergo


[09/10/2020 3:26 PM] kushti#0978
Any suggestions ?


[09/10/2020 3:44 PM] Robert K#0722
If we could come up with some sort of DeFi idea that also requires privacy that would be super cool. Something that no other blockchain could do, and potentially builds off or could work in tandem with oracles/stablecoin would be ideal I think for getting a lot of hype.


[09/10/2020 3:49 PM] Robert K#0722
If we had some sort of useful NFTs then maybe creating a frontend for the Auctions protocol we came up with would have been a good idea, but there's no real usecase for it I suppose for now.

{Reactions}

[09/10/2020 4:06 PM] Robert K#0722
Here's a few ideas off the top of my head that don't fit the above description perfectly, but they're something:
- Dutch Auctions (which we'll probably need for the stablecoin eventually)
- Generalizing fee emission boxes into a full fledged protocol where people can provide liquidity for others to use as tx fees for a given token. This is kind of an inbetween of UniSwap & the Ergo DEX, which could lean either way depending on how it's designed. This would be useful once we release a stablecoin so people can have stablecoin only wallets if they so wish which would be great for marketing of usecases of Ergo.
- Upgading the crowdfunding contracts into a full ICO contract? Meaning tokens are pre-minted, and if the ICO is a success then the tokens are automatically paid out to supporters. Though ICOs aren't popular these days so probably not much demand.

[09/10/2020 4:18 PM] mx#5165
maybe they could help with speeding up roadmap like with private cross chain swaps and gateways for swaps with different coins, i guess delivery of full fledged DEX will be most resources hungry process

{Reactions}
üëçüèª 

[09/10/2020 10:02 PM] kushti#0978
Auctions idea sounds good, and have a lot of applications


[09/10/2020 10:02 PM] kushti#0978
On privacy-preserving applications, likely we need for some research first to be done by me and/or Amitabh


[09/11/2020 4:02 PM] Robert K#0722
@kushti Maybe it could be a great idea to get anon_real to make a nice looking short static page to show off the ZK Treasury


[09/11/2020 4:02 PM] Robert K#0722
Could use https://pages.github.com/

GitHub Pages
Websites for you and your projects, hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live.


[09/11/2020 4:03 PM] Robert K#0722
Will help a lot to make the project feel real


[09/11/2020 8:49 PM] kushti#0978
@Robert K good ides, lemme ask anon.


[09/12/2020 7:31 AM] Robert K#0722
And probably doing the same for the Mixer, and every single project that is released that is reasonably well finished, is going to be important so it's not just devs looking at github repos, but there's actually something to show people publicly and point them there.


[09/12/2020 7:32 AM] Robert K#0722
Even if it's just a simple few paragraph intro + screenshots of the app running + a tutorial for getting setup (text + pictures/video) that would already do a lot imo.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[09/12/2020 9:14 PM] kushti#0978
Right. So the plan is to do 1-pager for each application already done, at least.


[09/12/2020 9:14 PM] kushti#0978
And websites also would be good


[09/12/2020 9:16 PM] kushti#0978
I've proposed that to anon_real

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[09/13/2020 11:55 PM] kushti#0978
@Robert K I think to propose auctions to anon_real


[09/14/2020 8:19 AM] Robert K#0722
Sounds good. Would be great to have our original protocol design/contracts fleshed out.


[09/14/2020 8:20 AM] Robert K#0722
If he could also implement a Dutch auction (which starts at max price and the price decreases overtime every block by X amount until someone purchases it) that would be awesome too.

{Reactions}
üëçüèª 

[09/14/2020 8:20 AM] Robert K#0722
Auctions will be more and more useful overtime as we start to create useful tokens in the ecosystem.


[09/22/2020 11:55 AM] mx#5165
@Justin1000 mentioned that we should create some strategy for foundation activities, agree with it, best would be through proposals i guess, so far above standard salaries there were for example some martketing proposals to come from different members but they didn`t above @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ


[09/22/2020 12:08 PM] mx#5165
so far we have Chico promo event planned i guess, @kushti talks to some market makers, that will be needed for sure above exchanges listings


[09/22/2020 12:10 PM] mx#5165
existing bots look like not enough or work in some different way than market makers usually do


[09/22/2020 12:12 PM] mx#5165
ERG/USDT pair on Hotbit doesn`t require our mm and would be nice addition also


[09/22/2020 1:27 PM] Justin1000#9555
@mx Yes, I think we need to have a bit more higher level strategic planning. So many super exciting things going on and great ideas but we need to drill down on our specific objectives, how and when we are going to get there and how we are going to maximize the gains of the great things going  on.


[09/22/2020 1:28 PM] Justin1000#9555
specifically i'm thinking we should all be laser focused on getting the price to a sustainable $10 subject  to market conditions staying where they are or improving. Not because we are all greedy guys but because we NEED this higher price so the Foundation can pay these greedy exchanges, promoters etc who don't know or understand the fundamentals but just want USD.


[09/22/2020 1:28 PM] Justin1000#9555
so i'm thinking of  doing an EFAM on that at least with my thoughts. With a $10 price we can afford A LOT of stuff we cannot now!


[09/22/2020 1:30 PM] Justin1000#9555
once we get to $10, we will go much higher and be able to afford even more. Very strong positive feedback loop with Ergo üòÄ


[09/22/2020 1:30 PM] Justin1000#9555
amazing how much has been accomplished with the price at 20cents for so long! imagine what we can do with the Foundation resources at $10 and higher!


[09/22/2020 1:49 PM] mx#5165
it is not impossible for sure with existing supply, usage of blockchain should help a lot also, i guess Emurgo is/will be the best example of it


[09/23/2020 1:48 AM] Justin1000#9555
Can we get email addresses for foundation members like name@ergoplatform.org?


[09/23/2020 2:06 AM] Justin1000#9555
We could set rules around when  it used. Dont think needs to be often at least for me. Most obvious use  case is when making exchange applications or correspondence with exchanges


[09/23/2020 1:56 PM] kushti#0978
we have team@ergoplatform.org


[09/23/2020 1:56 PM] kushti#0978
can do 3-4 new boxes


[09/23/2020 1:56 PM] kushti#0978

[09/25/2020 12:41 PM] Justin1000#9555
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ idea for big EFAM you might be interested in. not urgent. but could do 1) detailed analysis of exactly what Polkadot did to market itself in China...KOLs, press, events, everything; 2) show how Ergo could copy this totally only altering it for Ergo ethos and messaging and deploy our own China awareness campaign and the budget needed; 3) maybe we could think of ways to indirectly generate controversy among polkadot people in China...controversy could generate some free press! the "dot" people will be on the defensive having to justify their $3-4bn market cap where Ergo is at like $300mm and superior (I anticipate deploying this marketing campaign only when we have the money and a $10 ERG price if we can get there soon). we can then leverage off all they have done right and all the press they have generated!

People will most welcome someone  to whom they can tell how wonderful their platform is and who has an open mind, asks questions and listens.


[09/26/2020 3:04 AM] Justin1000#9555
Well I don't know the format but would think you will need the cards and need to be talking about Ergo to make contact with the funds, promoters, exchanges, press, etc. Need those same type of cards you had before but Chinese on  one side and English on another. If talking to Polkadot people be nice but main purpose is making contacts outside Polkadot and also seeing how everything is done.


[09/26/2020 10:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think I have reached out to all my targets and I have updated sheet. Probably leave the rest to @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ . long list but i think it is just copy and paste and mainly just tier 2-3 guys.


[09/26/2020 10:16 AM] Justin1000#9555
Of some note:
-Bitfinex CEO did at least respond and so did a close friend of his. Maybe they will have a look although wouldn't count on it.
-Michael Kapilkov ‚Äì Seems like great contact. @kushti I encourage being very proactive in giving him good info and getting him to write lots of articles on Ergo. Coin telegraph should be pretty good platform for reaching a wider audience.
-I have contacted head trader of OSL. He said would revert but couldn‚Äôt today because is  at offsite.

> @kushti any updates on creation of a ERG whales Telegram group?
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ Is this practical? To be effective, the whales will have to be identified and join. Is privacy/security a big concern?  Just a question. I don't know.


[09/27/2020 4:54 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
> Well I don't know the format but would think you will need the cards and need to be talking about Ergo to make contact with the funds, promoters, exchanges, press, etc. Need those same type of cards you had before but Chinese on  one side and English on another. If talking to Polkadot people be nice but main purpose is making contacts outside Polkadot and also seeing how everything is done.
@Justin1000  yeah, ok.

@kushti @Robert K @mx @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ  Here is the Strategy EFAM on Funding problem (or the PRICE problem...or the **EXCHANGE** problem). As i was making this became even more apparent to me how unacceptable it is we are still not listed on a Tier 1 Exchange. Can understand why we here 10x a day in Telegram about this problem. I put in some ideas that occurred to me in the memo. Also, I'm clearly serious about getting to $10 by Dec 31, 2020...95 days away. Think is highly feasible at this stage in Ergo's development and with Emurgo/Yoroi/Pools/Stable Coin/Ledger etc etc. But whether we actually achieve it depends on exchange listings. (and the market not falling apart of course)


[09/27/2020 1:29 PM] Justin1000#9555
Anyway, hope you have close look through this and keen to hear your thoughts. We got ~3 months.

nice summary, Gate should help with real volume for sure and with trust to exchanges, Binance next could have described effect i guess. Kucoin, by looking at their listing requirements, looks like most volume is created there by coin communities because they are required to do so. Maybe after Bez comes back, there can be some coordination of Ergonauts and improved efforts, i think Robert and Alex rather do more than enough for marketing already, it is miracle they have any time for it

Does anyone know if we can sponsor an Anon or someone in the community to write smart contract development tutorials using Ergo Playgrounds? As in, is there someone with the time/know how to do it. (And whether you guys would want to do that)


[10/01/2020 4:29 PM] Robert K#0722
I'm currently testing the playground via Scastie for the first time, and it's by far the best introductory environment for smart contract devs in the ecosystem right now.

[10/01/2020 4:31 PM] Robert K#0722
From a marketing perspective if we make this playground more visible/used, we can also argue that we have our own Playground vs. what Plutus has which everyone references for Cardano.


[10/01/2020 11:03 PM] kushti#0978
@Robert K I guess you're the second guy using it after greenhat. Need to check the Playgrounds.
anon_real had a plan to make a tutorial based on XOR game from the tutorial. Instead, he's doing auctions now. Which is better for now maybe. 
Maybe we can do some grant about new tutorials ?


[10/02/2020 9:30 AM] Robert K#0722
Ah I see.


[10/02/2020 9:30 AM] Robert K#0722
I think it makes a lot of sense. I just wrote a basic Pin Lock contract + scenario using the playground, and its a really good environment (better than Plutus playground imo)


[10/02/2020 9:32 AM] Robert K#0722
And the fact you can just share a link when you need to ask a question of someone else (ex. with an error), and they can run the code/read the error/fix your code and send it back to you with a new url, is actually quite an awesome experience.

This could seriously lower the barrier of entry for new contract devs, as they can just post the URL of their broken code in Discord, and we can take a look immediately without having to pull a git repo or anything.

And in the tutorial we can provide links after each milestone is complete so people can click/test and see the code running even before writing it themselves if they want a more interactive experience (as is more common these days in begginner/entry level tutorials with interactive code samples)

@Robert K Dunno much about this but seems to be just what these guys on youtube (Why Cardno? Ep.60 This is missing for $1 ADA) are talking about for Cardano. Online smart contracts laboratory and they are saying essential so this playground we seem to have already probably very cool and useful (especially if you already tried it and like it!)


[10/02/2020 12:16 PM] kushti#0978
@Robert K example is very clear. Probably makes sense to notify about its insecurity (as a miner can steal the box with frontrunning)


[10/02/2020 12:17 PM] kushti#0978
Maybe we can publish such examples regularly


[10/02/2020 12:38 PM] Robert K#0722
Yep, this is an insecure contract but a good example.


[10/02/2020 12:39 PM] Robert K#0722
When I first wrote a small mini-course for Plutus (which eventually was used for Emurgo Academy in India) 1.5 years ago I used this example as its good for an intro.


[10/02/2020 12:40 PM] Robert K#0722
I think one key thing we are missing is a smart contract education onboarding path for devs to join.


[10/02/2020 12:59 PM] Robert K#0722
In lots of languages we have the idea of "X by example" like "Rust By Example"


[10/02/2020 1:00 PM] Robert K#0722
What if we create a new github repo called "ErgoScript-By-Example" and allow anyone to submit PRs to submit examples


[10/02/2020 1:00 PM] Robert K#0722
We can create some sort of format for these which example sumissions must follow, kind of like how EIPs have a format


[10/02/2020 1:01 PM] Robert K#0722
We can have something basic with like:
- Author
- Contract title
- Ergo Playground link


[10/02/2020 1:02 PM] Robert K#0722
And then the code below


[10/02/2020 1:02 PM] Robert K#0722
And we can enforce that all examples have a contract + testing off-chain code via the playground. And all code is commented/documented.


[10/02/2020 1:02 PM] Robert K#0722
Else the PR won't get accepted.


[10/02/2020 1:02 PM] Robert K#0722
And they all need a ergo playground link


[10/02/2020 2:42 PM] kushti#0978
Sounds good! 

Currently, we have a lot of fragmented information, spread around wikis, forum, tutorials, papers (e.g. multi-stage  contracts in the UTXO model) , repos etc


[10/02/2020 2:42 PM] kushti#0978
Structured approach is very much needed


[10/02/2020 2:43 PM] kushti#0978
We can also do some promo around dev communities with it


[10/02/2020 2:51 PM] Robert K#0722
Yes, we very much need to work on compiling all of the scattered work together.


[10/02/2020 2:52 PM] Robert K#0722
Maybe just having a bunch of categorized github repos where people can always update with PRs, and then on ergoplatform.org we have a page with all of the github repos


[10/02/2020 2:53 PM] Robert K#0722
So currently we could have:


[10/02/2020 2:53 PM] Robert K#0722
- Awesome Ergo (using the one we have https://github.com/ergoplatform/awesome-ergo)
- ErgoScript-By-Example


[10/02/2020 2:55 PM] Robert K#0722
Any other ideas for what else we could have repos for? Maybe one for documenting media posts? (Videos/articles)


[10/02/2020 2:55 PM] Robert K#0722
Maybe we could also ressurect that idea to have a repo for a list of EIP-6 specs all in one place.


[10/02/2020 3:37 PM] Robert K#0722
I guess the page for linking all of the repos could be called "Knoweldge Base", or something akin to that?


[10/02/2020 5:32 PM] kushti#0978
@Robert K greenhat has a repo for certified contracts


[10/02/2020 5:32 PM] kushti#0978
It would be good to update awesome-ergo at this point , will try to do that over the weekend


[10/02/2020 7:25 PM] Robert K#0722
So I thought about it and I think we can do a mini release/announcement of "ErgoScript By Example" next week. With Yoroi launching at the start of the week we'll likely get a lot more eyes on the project, and so this can also be a good time to release this repo in case some devs might want to try writing smart contracts too.

I've gone ahead and got the repo prepped + added the first example Fund Lock contract. Let me know if you think anything should be changed. https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergoscript-by-example

I can also record a short video at the start of next week walking people through the repo, how the examples are laid out, and what scastie/Ergo Playground are so it's super simple for everyone to understand (and we'll get more people testing). I imagine we can release this on the Ergo youtube channel?

I'm hoping we can try to release a new example every week or two, and announce it every time in the community/on twitter to get more people looks at the examples.


[10/06/2020 8:48 AM] Robert K#0722
And maybe we can converge the "Design Patterns" Ergo Forum thread with ErgoScript By Example, and get people creating examples of their design patterns so that they're approachable/understandable for everyone.


[10/06/2020 8:49 AM] Robert K#0722

[10/06/2020 10:13 AM] morphic#4133
Unfortunately I'm stuck with Sigma, profiling, PRs, test coverage and other not so exciting stuff. Hope the Foundation can hire a developer to start transferring my current work to him/her. I would love to be able to do something new.


[10/06/2020 2:49 PM] mx#5165
maybe some of existing external contributors could be hired, like gtklocker, knizhnik(he was to be hired as far i remember), i suspect that jasondavies is rather working for the big miner, gagarin doesn`t fit i guess for core development


[10/06/2020 4:40 PM] kushti#0978
@morphic I guess we need to pass test coverage to some other guy, you're too expensive for such work . Sigma can not be transferred in the current state I'm afraid of, a lot of incomprehensible code there, and even README is missed.

> @morphic I guess we need to pass test coverage to some other guy, you're too expensive for such work . Sigma can not be transferred in the current state I'm afraid of, a lot of incomprehensible code there, and even README is missed.
@kushti Unfortunately I cannot wait until somebody do test coverage. It is a strict prerequisite for refactoring and changes towards 5.0 and JIT based simplified interpreter. 
It already helped me to catch subtle regressions while I did optimisations. So I think testing and performance are important enough to spend my time, however boring it may be. 
I hope to remove ALL incomprehensible code immediately after 5.0 release (i.e. in 5.0.1). This means v5.0 will contain both the OLD (incomprehensible) and the NEW (simplified and hopefully comprehensible) code, which have very small intersection with the old code.
Ideally, somebody can start working on 5.0 JIT based interpreter right now (under my guidance), so that by the time v5.0 is released, we already have new core developer who is able to maintain new Sigma interpreter.


[10/07/2020 1:28 PM] kushti#0978

[10/08/2020 9:39 AM] Robert K#0722

[10/08/2020 10:04 AM] Justin1000#9555
Defer to you guys on status of various releases but yes, makes sense to me to release these to fill the gap between now and Gate.io! Also will just increase/sustain our momentum going into Gate.io. Wish they would stop mucking around though and list Ergo! Hope the delay means they are going to do more to promote and push Ergo when they finally do list it!!

Yoroi release and ann from Gate would be actually nice on the same day


[10/08/2020 10:37 AM] kushti#0978
@Robert K btw I checked greenhat's swap examples and I think I know why I mostly skipped Playground examples before. greenhat used ErgoScala, which is not documented at all, and so less comprehensible. You did a nice trick with embedding ErgoScript.

I am rewriting swap example with ErgoScript also, can release next week, maybe also with video ?


[10/08/2020 10:47 AM] Robert K#0722

> Yoroi release and ann from Gate would be actually nice on the same day
@mx @kushti MX is right that tomorrow is official end of Chinese National Day Holiday. Work over weekend too. BUT that may not apply to Gate. You know they launched that polka crap (listing vote 43) a couple days ago and then delayed the AMA for polka. So they may not want to do anything until after whatever break it is they want. But to MX's point, @kushti, you may consider telling Gate.io that 1) releasing Yoroi tomorrow (if 100% confirmed) and could launch listing vote right after that to build momentum and excitement (tell them the time too of Yoroi! they never launch listing votes after 10 AM UTC) or 2) that we will be releasing a lot of positive news in next few days and request to be the next Listing Vote that Gate.io does. This is GOOD for Gate.io traders and Gate.io because it harnesses the momentum and maybe Ergo will trade up all at same time on all this news resulting in a big fat $$$$ airdrop to their users!! GOOD FOR EVERYONE!!!!

Its funny as its popping up in Telegram right now. But I was going to wait until Gate.io listing then bring this up: **LEDGER and HW integration**. What is with this guy Jason Davies? Seems he has been working on Ledger since Ergo launched or as far back as I can remember. Is he really doing it or just messing around? Or he is unable to do it? Or he needs something from Ergo? If he is unable/unwilling to do it though, I think we should be looking for someone else ASAP. Ledger/HW wallets are going to start to become very important very quickly if price rises and the $ value people are holding goes up.


[10/09/2020 7:40 AM] Robert K#0722
He's been working on it for about half a year, though when I looked at the original proposal said it'd take approx. 3 weeks iirc.


[10/09/2020 7:41 AM] Robert K#0722
He's intelligent and has done some good stuff for Ergo, but I'm not sure why stuff he works on gets so delayed.


[10/09/2020 7:56 AM] Justin1000#9555
Ok. Maybe he just needs some polite encouragement to prioritize it above all else then. If things work out for us and the price goes up a lot along with more exchange listings etc it's entirely predictable everyone is going to be nagging non stop about this. Might as well address it now. I wish he could get it done.


[10/09/2020 7:59 AM] mx#5165
there was to be crowdfunding website, ledger, mining pool with his own optimized miner, he backed out later that he doesn`t know anything about optimized miner while he is contributing to Autolykos v2, apparently has time to find security issues in different places all the time, maybe he is getting grants from someone else, very strange, basically always says he can do it when some new idea appears


[10/09/2020 8:38 AM] Robert K#0722
Did he already get the grant Ergs for ledger support?


[10/09/2020 8:39 AM] Robert K#0722
Might be a good idea thenceforth to only dish out grants in chunks (as milestones are hit) if there are no past performance metrics of individuals.


[10/09/2020 9:30 AM] kushti#0978
@Robert K he got first tranche (50%) of a grant few months ago


[10/09/2020 9:30 AM] kushti#0978
Pushing him


[10/09/2020 9:31 AM] kushti#0978
Before Ergo, he was active member of ZCash community


[10/09/2020 9:31 AM] kushti#0978
And there he started a lot of things also (e.g. one of the first miners), not all of them were finished also


[10/09/2020 10:02 AM] Robert K#0722
Ah I see. I still trust he'll finish so it's not like it wont happen, but definitely too bad realistic timelines don't seem to be his thing.

[10/09/2020 6:22 PM] Justin1000#9555
cc JASON DAVIES!!!! if he can't handle it, should get someone else on it ASAP. or I understand he was doing ledger first and was going to eventually meander over to Trezor when Ledger was done. maybe get someone on Trezor side to start work? then its in parallel. Just a random idea. TBH I am not expert on HW integration to say the least. I can imagine it is not the easiest thing.


[10/09/2020 7:04 PM] Robert K#0722
I'm not sure we can really find someone to jump in on this, it's definitely not trivial.


[10/09/2020 7:54 PM] Justin1000#9555
yeah i always thought it was hard. so was happy when he stepped up. but...so far nothing.


[10/09/2020 7:56 PM] Justin1000#9555
anyway, I will start asking around. no idea i will produce any results but I don't think relying on this one guy who has had 6+ months is best policy unless he is going to give some assurances ASAP that he will deliver in near-future.


[10/09/2020 10:20 PM] kushti#0978
Will ask some guys around

@kushti yeah let's get someone else on it ASAP. Can prioritize trezor with them if Jason still might deliver on ledger side but let's prioritize speed above all else so can pay to get trezor and/or ledger whatever can be done fastest. This is actually important and will help price.

Another issue with unstable developers is about gagarin55 likely, not sure he is going or capable to deliver DEX on time, also, refusing to accept help from outside (with UI etc)


[10/13/2020 6:30 PM] mx#5165
let`s see if anons ask after auctions about new developments, i would seriously consider to propose DEX gui to them, it will have lots of components including privacy and will require lots of dedication and implementations in the future


[10/13/2020 6:38 PM] mx#5165
i think we could ask also about help with binaries if needed, gagarin will eventually end with wallet with inbuilt node

I'm all for interoperability. The question is, does anybody use Gravity, other than Waves? I have only basic knowledge in cross-chain protocols, but why Gravity, why not Cosmos or Polkadot? I hear a lot about Polkadot here and there, but nothing about Gravity. 
How much time and resources it will take from us?


[10/15/2020 7:05 PM] kushti#0978
@morphic Tron , Solana, Band


[10/15/2020 7:06 PM] kushti#0978
Gravity should provide liquidity , would be especially good to get ERC-20 tokens (incl. USDT)


[10/15/2020 7:06 PM] kushti#0978
About integration details, still TBD

Solana is getting pretty popular these days, i think Gravity a good protocol to integrate as i believe more projects will jump on board going forward into the future.

@Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ  Had a call with "Alex" from China who knows a lot about Chinese market:
* on OKEX, he suggested to wait a bit. Likely their CEO will be charged with money laundering (if I understood correctly)
* he can connect us with BKEX & Huobi, MathWallet etc
* he also proposed to publish some articles in 8btc and other media, then made some AMA before doing presentations in the real world
* yield farming craziness starting to fade out. Most popular things in China now are DeGo (some NFT-based lotteery) and FileCoin (all the miners have jumped into it), still, a lot of hopes for DeFi


[10/16/2020 6:11 PM] kushti#0978
Also, from talking with him and one other guy today, seems getting Eth/USDT liquidity on top of Ergo is very much needed, as most of retail investors are in them.


[10/16/2020 8:20 PM] mx#5165
you mean to support ETH and USDT from their blockchain through DEX and gateways at the same time? sounds good


[10/16/2020 8:34 PM] mx#5165
any such integration should be nice promo in their communities, especially with new designs and features, anons will add them to services in one day


[10/16/2020 8:41 PM] mx#5165

üòÜ 

[10/17/2020 2:48 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah I think OKEX we just wait. Nothing new for exchanges. But it is bad timing! They had a comprehensive marketing plan there so could have helped us a lot if things worked out.


[10/17/2020 2:49 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ and I have been discussing the China marketing and the awareness situation. Frankly despite our translation, our China awareness and marketing is in BAD shape. But Noah can't fix this by himself. And my position has been we wait until the price is higher to address this. But we can address it earlier if others think we should prioritize it and spend some money here.


[10/17/2020 2:51 AM] Justin1000#9555
But I think at minimum we will need to hire a community moderator. Noah has already found a candidate that is like RMB 8-10k a month so around US$1.2-1.5k. Then we could spend anywhere between $25-100k on marketing. if we just go off and spend $25-100k on marketing with no full-time community moderator, i think we will get an immediate boost but then will fade away and we won't get our moneys worth.


[10/17/2020 2:55 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ knows a lot about this already and we can deploy a campaign of various sizes but I think its fair to say we need the moderator on  permanent basis ($1.2-1.5k / month) and probably a minimum cost of ~US$20k for campaign. Later when price is higher then we could deploy something really comprehensive like what Polkadot did (Noah is researching that). The moderator candidate Noah identified is a girl that did 2 years of translation for Cardano.


[10/17/2020 2:57 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ what do you think? Is that right? Moderator full time + campaign expenses of $20k+ gradually to end of year to make this worthwhile? I'd support it of others would. I actually have been dissappointed for a while our China awareness is so limited. Maybe its time to address it but not attractive spending so many ERGs when price still below <$1!! hence why have not proposed anything


[10/17/2020 2:58 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ if its in principle a good idea, i guess you need to put down on paper in an EFAM or just some sort of proposal what exactly we would do and budget and timing. Probably we want the campaign to last to end of year. But lets first hear what you think and others think before designing specific campaign.


[10/17/2020 2:59 AM] Justin1000#9555
On ETH and USDT liquidity...don't know much about that. But maybe there was some logic to Gate.io's madness of those 2 pairs. So we got those pairs on Gate at least. Can drive the hordes there to trade.


[10/17/2020 3:35 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674

@kushti what do you think the ETA is on the HF? these absurd ridiculous 10k block sales on tidex everyday are probably terrible for price. see them everyday and on HotBit. mining back in the hands of small players to extent possible will be good. current situation is kinda ridiculous and bad for price and order book. I think lately volume so low these 1-3 farms must have built up a lot of Ergs to sell over coming days/weeks...


[10/17/2020 9:30 PM] Justin1000#9555
haha, now there is 10,000 ERG to sell on both HotBit and Tidex by these clown(s) at 6000 sats. F*ck them. hope the HF can happen soon. guess takes time tho to make sure everything is smooth and Sigma 4.0 ready but damn...

@Justin1000 agree, mining centralization now seems to be the biggest problem. The most radical solution would be to switch non-outsourceability off to see pools and small miners jumping into, can revitalize the community a lot.

HF ETA depends not on me only. I'm also afraid that after HF hashrate can be dropped significantly (if NO not switched off) tbh.


[10/17/2020 10:29 PM] kushti#0978
On Chinese marketing campaign, I've got $40K estimation for a complete campaign which can give huge boost around the market.


[10/17/2020 10:30 PM] kushti#0978
The walls are depressing for sure, not all the miners selling though, but many small miners will accumulate also.

@kushti What would this inlclude excactly?


[10/18/2020 6:19 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti Just regarding HF, I think my view for whatever it is worth is that should do the Autolykos V2 (assuming it works), keep NO. Keep NO because: 1) long-term security benefits ‚Äì should assume worst that Ergo is attacked by malicious powerful actors and unless something has changed NO is good for security (and I thought it may have already prevented rent hash type attacks); 2) NO is unique to Ergo; 3) probably too late to get most of the benefits from miner user base as apps are on the way, hopefully price higher and probably ASICs etc; 4) focus on end user APPs/experience/functionality rather than miners as the APPS to come will be super powerful and exciting I think and not so far out now unlike when we launched.


[10/18/2020 6:21 AM] Justin1000#9555
Since HF may take a while longer maybe can mitigate it in near term by 1) China marketing campaign hopefully boosting buying interest; 2) moving/arbing liquidity from these miner(s) on Tidex/Hotbit over to gate.io into a nice order book there to give people a big exchange to buy with a order book that doesn't look freakish! I tried doing some arbing/moving but was pointless and time consuming. Think need someone with more expertise, time and also more buyers on Gate.io and it should be easy enough.


[10/18/2020 6:21 AM] Justin1000#9555
Then just do the HF as soon as practical and hopefully that resolves the issue!

@Justin1000 Well, yes, with NO we're protected from attacks made with rented power (most of recent 50+% attacks were made with rented hashpower, including ETC). So we can keep NO, my concern is that Ergo mining industry will remain not developed (with pools like ezpool or ergopool) or concentrated. Let's see.

Mining field is complicated, it is a mess to try to do anything good here. A lot of 3-4 GB RAM GPUs are coming, as they can't  miner ETH/ETC/RVN anymore


[10/18/2020 8:38 PM] kushti#0978
The simplest option is to stick with Autolykos2. Then @morphic let's work towards HF

@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ had multiple quotations from before from groups met in Hangzhou and maybe other places. Might have something better. Those were from a year ago. Will leave to him to elaborate. Hope can deploy something soon.

@Justin1000 Ha, they had only bottled water, and ran out fast. No food or refreshments at all. Pretty good turnout though, maybe 200+ people I guess. Said hi to the guy sitting next to me, programmer looking for projects to work on, he'll be following Ergo. Didn't listen too much to the presentations, went in the hall to talk to people instead. Met one of the Polkadot community managers. They had their had of China marketing present and she gave an overview of their China marketing and promotion, I took notes, so that should be useful in the future when we have resources to do more.

Some general thoughts on marketing in China (not a response to the \\\inkrypto proposal).


[10/20/2020 9:19 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
One main point: in general, I think the goal for any promotion in China should be to get real people to our WeChat, the most popular platform in China.

I'm asking around here and I think I can likely find something better than the proposal from \\\inkrypto.


[10/20/2020 9:24 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I contacted, Li Qi , one of the Chinese marketing guys @Justin1000 and I met at the big blockchain conference in Hangzhou last year. Li Qi is now at a crypto incubator fund, http://www.ju.capital/  I called him and we talked for a while. As a crypto incubator fund, they don't do marketing as a service normally, but since they invest in crypto projects, they claim to have connections with exchanges, media and advertising channels, and then can push buttons and flip switches. He mentioned for example, normally an article on jinse.com (major crypto website) would cost around CNY 6,000 but they make a call and get it for ~50%.

He‚Äôs studying Ergo and will get back to us. I expect if they are interested they will want some kind of partnership, not just service for fee.

Could be good to have a good marketing partner in China whose interests are aligned with EF. Otherwise who knows, maybe get just someone who would be happy to just bilk us for a one shot deal which may get little results for us.

We have a candidate for China Community Assistant, Eva Qing. Eva joined one of our WeChat Chat groups this June. Said she learned of Ergo while doing translation work on Cardano and that she was Cardano translator (via an agency) for 2 years, and is very familiar with blockchain. In June she had offered to be our full time translator for US$2,000 / month, told her we didn't need at the time. This month I asked her if she might be interested in helping us with our China community efforts  (draft of job description attached). She said yes, asked for CNY10K (USD1,500) / month, negotiable.

Yeah a call with Wincrypto would be great. China time zone, I have work meeting all afternoon Friday, but otherwise pretty much any day any time 8 am - 9 pm is fine for me.


[10/22/2020 1:14 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
If we were to hire Eva she would to as per outlined in the above PDF I posted "Ergo_Social_Media_Manager_Job_Description" + any ad hoc things we can think of for her to do..


[10/22/2020 1:16 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
With the hope that she can potentially take on a bigger role and more responsibility as Ergo China community grows.


[10/22/2020 1:19 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Not right away but eventually I would expect her to be proactive and help think of new ideas for China ecosystem, not just passively follow instructions. I think she might have the potential to achieve this (she's already proactively sent me some ideas via WeChat).


[10/22/2020 2:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti we definitely need someone to manage the chat groups and stimulate conversations, post stuff etc. like we have in our English and other channels. But 1) not sure we need to hire someone specifically at this moment or the marketing groups will do it (guess @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ can ask them);  2) not sure Eva is right person as her background is translation as far as i understand but could try her out - its not rocket science so if she is enthusiastic probably could do it. i would just check with marketing groups what they think then we can decide to try Eva or not. $1500/month is a lot i guess...but not sure what alternative is if marketing groups don't handle it. As far as I know, no one has volunteered to do it for free or a small amount of Ergs...guess that would be ideal.


[10/22/2020 2:12 AM] Justin1000#9555
maybe after we start marketing, volunteer(s) will appear and do it for free or small amount of Ergs and can stop paying $1500 / month.


[10/23/2020 11:44 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ alright, I will have a call on Mon with a guy who introduced //inkCrypto. I will ask for more info and contacts. Also, he promised to connect us w. Huobi and OKEX. 
We also need to consider how to sell ergs , will create a forum post on that in coming days


[10/24/2020 7:22 PM] Justin1000#9555
> @kushti we don't need contact with OKEX as already have it. Please see if you can delegate as many tasks to others as possible. As price of Ergs goes higher this will be more and more important.

Regarding China marketing


[10/28/2020 8:57 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I have been contacting crypto marketers here in China. One crypto WeChat Public Account that I got a proposal from and talked with is Budao Caijing (Â∏ÉÈÅìË¥¢Áªè). Their proposal is as follows:
RMB25,000 (~USD3,700).
One full length article that we write, can include images, our WeChat QR code and our website links, gets published in 10 different WeChat Public Accounts. Our article also gets push promoted in 100 WeChat Chat Groups (which are at least decent quality groups, does not include the bottom feeder sludge groups).

Regarding China Marketing & Community Manager


[10/28/2020 8:57 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
If we are to do any sustained China marketing, I think we will need a marketing & community manager to help. Besides being able to answer general questions about Ergo in the chat groups, this person should be eager to become deeply familiar with Ergo so that we have consistent branding, terminology and theme for China marketing.


[10/28/2020 8:58 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
So‚Ä¶.


[10/28/2020 8:58 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I propose that we go with the above proposal from Budao for RMB25,000 (~USD3,700) (but good chance I can negotiate some discount).
I also propose that we hire Eva Qing (former Cardano translator) as our China community manager. I‚Äôve been chatting with her on WeChat and she has already offered a lot of suggestions and ideas, and seems to me that she has potential. She asked for US$1,500 / month but I think we could offer her US$1,000. She said she is willing to be paid in ERG.


[10/28/2020 8:58 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
What do you guys think?


[10/28/2020 9:01 AM] Robert K#0722
What proposal from Budao are you referring to?


[10/28/2020 9:02 AM] Robert K#0722
I'm personally a bit skeptical that a community manager is going to really add a lot of value especially for the cost, but I'm fine with giving it a test for a couple months.


[10/28/2020 9:10 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674

@Robert K Yes it would be on a trial basis, see how she is.  Results should be easy enough to measure (number of new WeChat followers).  Agree that in English a paid community manager is probably not needed, but its a bit messy here in China trying to manage WeChat groups and my Chinese is not good enough.

So for budao, we're spending 3.7k for effectively a one-off announcement that we write?


[10/28/2020 9:37 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
USD3.7K for a full article that gets published in 10 different WeChat Public Accounts and then pushed in 100 WeChat groups.


[10/28/2020 9:38 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Last year we did a paid article in one WeChat Public Account and it drove about 500 people or so to our WeChat.


[10/28/2020 9:39 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
We also did a paid flash note announcement in a popular crypto website but it added no noticable # of followers to our WeChat.

RE China Community manager, besides managing our WeChat Chat Groups, it would include content and management of all of our China platforms, namely, Weibo, WeChat Public Account, Telegram and we should also set up other accounts like an account on ChainNews (Winkypto included this in their proposal but it is something we can do ourselves).


[10/28/2020 9:47 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Content on all these platforms is not as easy as copy and paste the Chinese translations from our website. Takes quite a bit of time. So far I've been doing this but not a very good job of it.

If we wanted to publish articles on Chinese crypto websites, I think it would cost about US$1,000 per article, depending on the website, if we contact the websites directly.


[10/28/2020 9:51 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
But I think articles in 3rd party WeChat Public Accounts would be more effective in increasing our number of WeChat followers.


[10/28/2020 9:51 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Since the reader is already in the same WeChat APP and the article will have our QR code to our WeChat account.


[10/28/2020 9:54 AM] Robert K#0722
Hmm, my main worry is that this would all be a money sink and we don't really get much as a result.


[10/28/2020 9:54 AM] Robert K#0722
I'm guessing the end goal is effectively to get more people who buy Ergs right?


[10/28/2020 9:55 AM] Robert K#0722
We won't likely find any new devs I imagine this way, or people who build anything.


[10/28/2020 9:58 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
End goal is to increase the number of our WeChat followers (real followers, people who are actually interested in Ergo). No idea if they will buy ERG or not.


[10/28/2020 9:59 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Correct, I do not expect we'll get any new devs or people who will build anything.


[10/28/2020 9:59 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Although more WeChat followers might help increase the price of ERG which might attract more devs.


[10/28/2020 10:01 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Yeah, I guess I'm kind of asking you guys to take a leap of faith on me with this. But I'm actually much more worried about spending US$40K for a big promotion package that might not get us much. I honestly think this US$3.7K might get us more WeChat followers than the US$40K proposal from Winkrypto.


[10/28/2020 10:02 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Wechat is by far the most popular platform in China in general and also it seems for crypto. It can be compared very roughly to WhatsAPP + Telegram + Facebook mobile all in one. Besides being a social app, it also has a payments platform. In Shenzhen and other big cities in China at least, cash is almost entirely not used by now. Instead, besides bank transfers, virtually everything in daily life is paid for using the WeChat app.


[10/28/2020 10:04 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Winkrypto proposal only mentions one WeChat public account (RealSatoshi) whereas Budao gets us published in 10.


[10/28/2020 10:05 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Some things like Newsflash might not be that usefull.


[10/28/2020 10:06 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
For example, last year SWFT wallet did a Newsflash for us for free. It was distributed in about 16 channels (websites and crypto mobile apps) total, including some of the top crypto websites. However, in those websites it was buried in the back pages and could only be found by going into sub-accounts within the websites. The devil is in the details.


[10/28/2020 10:08 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
So based on my very limited experience I'm trying to get us the most bang for the buck.


[10/28/2020 10:08 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Budao atually also included a whole giant package of all kinds of stuff but I talked with him and decided the above 3.7K proposal would most likely be the most effective.

Hopefully by 2021 @Robert K and @kushti will be coming to China to run programming bootcamps and contests to get the Chinese really involved.


[10/28/2020 10:39 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
But first they need to hear of Ergo and be able to see some search engine results for it in Chinese when they search for it with Baidu.


[10/28/2020 10:40 AM] Robert K#0722
Good points.


[10/28/2020 10:41 AM] Robert K#0722
I'd be fine with accepting a proposal to try both of these approaches with Budao + the community manager for 2 months and see the results we get.


[10/28/2020 10:42 AM] Robert K#0722
So hopefully about $5.7k USD to cover both of these right (for 2 month test of community manager)? I think that's reasonable enough if you think this can be considered as a good enough shot to gauge results from.


[10/28/2020 10:47 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Great, yes two months I think is enough, so yes, about $5.7k USD (I'll wait to hear from others here before drafting a proposal and putting it to board vote).


[10/28/2020 10:54 AM] Justin1000#9555
I am also in favor of this. I think we really need it. China is nearly world's largest economy and the price is down and liquidity on gate very disappointing so more buyers would be good. And while I wouldn't expect an immediate influx of developers it is possible that if this is somewhat successful it will raise our profile in china possibly leading to more volunteers, partnership opportunities etc. The price for this exercise is also reasonable. We may need to do another one immediately after HF to market it to miners etc. But we can see how this one goes first.


[10/28/2020 11:01 AM] Robert K#0722
Sounds good.


[10/28/2020 12:29 PM] morphic#4133
This sounds good to me as well. I wonder what we need to have integration of Ergo with payment capabilities of WeChat. As far as I know WeChat payments not only popular, it is the default way of people buying, paying and exchanging money. 
I don't remember has it been already discussed, but I propose to announce some kind of a grant for WeChat integration. (tipping bot or something).


[10/28/2020 12:57 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
@morphic yes, cash is almost virtually unseen nowadays in China,  replaced with WeChat payment.


[10/28/2020 1:00 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Regarding possible ERG and WeChat payment integration, the Chinese government is very sensitive with currency controls and payment platforms, including WeChat and Alipay. No crypto currencies are integrated with WeChat Pay currently.

Indeed, gate.io seems to have ended up crashing the price due to them selling the "airdropped" tokens for effectively 50%

@kushti Good points! Here is my reply: https://www.ergoforum.org/t/market-making-and-otc-deals/356/6?u=mobybit


[10/30/2020 2:39 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ i responded too. seems simple and not something should be spending any time  on right now. need to prioritize.


[10/30/2020 2:41 AM] Justin1000#9555
Also @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ surprised you didn't propose the Foundation paying you for the tiny marketing campaign. why not? You just pay them RMB and get Ergs at market price from foundation. its what we did before. you can then keep them or sell them...who cares. Then we don't have to waste @kushti 's time to go find $ or RMB or whatever it is. For Eva, she just provides an address and then every month you tell us how much she is getting so @kushti can arrange with the monthly payments. it is just 2 months! Simple!


[10/30/2020 2:44 AM] Justin1000#9555
see if she can start earlier or if we can launch the campaign before she starts. defer to you on whether is practical or not. but need more marketing with price dropping due to these indiscriminate miner dumps.

@kushti let`s just put proposals on forum to vote on them


[10/30/2020 3:29 PM] kushti#0978
let's discuss details first )


[10/30/2020 3:29 PM] kushti#0978
I'm not sure such spending is needed


[10/30/2020 3:29 PM] kushti#0978
but why not to try


[10/30/2020 3:39 PM] mx#5165
ChainNews has much better ranking than 8btc so may be good


[10/30/2020 4:28 PM] kushti#0978
@mx when Cass returns ?


[10/30/2020 4:28 PM] kushti#0978
For PRs, they're asking for comparison with Eth etc


[10/30/2020 4:29 PM] kushti#0978
and also DEXes

[10/30/2020 4:35 PM] mx#5165
@kushtii think we need to present comparisons between utxo and extended utxo, additionally sigma protocols so Emurgo`s Research is the best material we have now


[10/30/2020 4:53 PM] mx#5165
hopefully with new year we will break the barrier of running full nodes and joining Ergo mining after HF, much better price discovery through regular miners should follow, they will create liquidity on their level, at the moment we have something like pos economics


[10/30/2020 4:57 PM] Robert K#0722
On the plus side no one can argue later on that miners hoarded a lot of tokens in the early days üòÖ


[10/30/2020 5:00 PM] kushti#0978
hard to say, in first months not so many tokens did reach exchanges


[10/30/2020 5:00 PM] kushti#0978
they also did not seat in miners' wallets


[10/30/2020 5:01 PM] kushti#0978
so some accumulation took place


[10/30/2020 5:01 PM] kushti#0978
with HF or no, with big exchanges or no still marketing is the key factor


[10/30/2020 5:01 PM] kushti#0978
there're no magic things which will bring us to the top


[10/30/2020 5:10 PM] mx#5165
regular miners are the main marketing for POW, they don`t wonder about otc, they just hit exchanges


[10/30/2020 5:12 PM] mx#5165
Ergo will appear in profitability stats, pools services etc


[10/30/2020 5:14 PM] mx#5165
that`s what brings other pow coins without features on top


[10/30/2020 5:17 PM] mx#5165
if you remember first few weeks with regular miners that`s what we should see again after HF


[10/30/2020 5:26 PM] mx#5165
after we get more or less to normal, marketing should boost it more for sure, marketing works much better with pow than with pos

[10/30/2020 8:30 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 miners are selling coins mined, not sure HF will fix it. Maybe orderbooks will have less walls though


[10/30/2020 8:38 PM] kushti#0978
@mx marketing around mining communities AHEAD of the HF is very much needed


[10/30/2020 8:38 PM] kushti#0978
are you in touch with Christian from SlushPool?


[10/30/2020 8:39 PM] mx#5165
nope, had to be someone else


[10/30/2020 8:41 PM] mx#5165
@kushti marketing around mining communities is for sure needed, the difference is we are not testnet like before and pool operators will need to do it by themselves, services like whattomine won`t promote in front


[10/30/2020 8:43 PM] kushti#0978
@mx uupool (York's pool , pretty known but involved in some scandals before as well) will support the fork


[10/30/2020 8:43 PM] mx#5165
yes, i remember and some other, don`t remember name


[10/30/2020 8:44 PM] Justin1000#9555
> @Justin1000 miners are selling coins mined, not sure HF will fix it. Maybe orderbooks will have less walls though
@kushti No there are like 1 to 3 miners selling coins mined! And they r certainly using shitty gpus next to hydro plants with no electricity cost. So why would HF not solve this? And also the sell walls and order books are HUGE issue. We need normalized order books and decentralize mining!


[10/30/2020 8:46 PM] mx#5165
@kushti so now the process will look like pools-software improvement-regular miners-better price discovery(top miners don`t provide it on exchanges otherwise they would bring Bitcoin to its knees)


[10/30/2020 8:51 PM] kushti#0978
btw let's add mhs to this chat?


[10/30/2020 8:51 PM] kushti#0978

@Justin1000 orderbooks will be better for sure. Total supply will be the same though(maybe less in first weeks by like 20-40%)


[10/30/2020 8:53 PM] kushti#0978
Miner do not accumulate much


[10/30/2020 8:54 PM] mx#5165
we are missing the factor that is happening above the top miners in other coins, that`s why they are running pools for regular miners


[10/30/2020 8:55 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah but if divided up as opposed to a few PIRATE miners using exploit huge difference. These fools are sitting on huge crappy GPUs next to hdro electricity and just mine for free and dump indiscriminately.


[10/30/2020 8:55 PM] Justin1000#9555
Got to get the pirates gone...


[10/30/2020 8:56 PM] mx#5165
it is needed so pools can start compete yes but if HF can come in 2 months then making two HFs doesn`t make sense


[10/30/2020 8:56 PM] Justin1000#9555
They are just using optimized software to exploit pow weakness and dumping erg to make some extra btc.


[10/30/2020 8:57 PM] Justin1000#9555
@mx Yeah just HF asap!


[10/30/2020 8:58 PM] kushti#0978
one HF then 1 SF


[10/30/2020 8:58 PM] kushti#0978
SF will be not painful at all


[10/30/2020 8:58 PM] kushti#0978
HF will be

Big I think...was focused on etc mining 3 years ago. I known chris for long time and told him about ergo pre launch but he flaked out and didnt meet me


[10/30/2020 9:02 PM] Justin1000#9555
Maybe ninja pool and the other pools support HF. Anyway I gotta go to bed. Talk later.


[10/30/2020 9:04 PM] kushti#0978
ninja pool is Cardano's stake pool I guess?


[10/30/2020 9:04 PM] kushti#0978
so what about mhs?


[10/30/2020 9:05 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 sleep well man we'll do it sooner or later )


[10/30/2020 9:05 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yes did cardone stake pool too  Think that was AFTER etc mining.


[10/30/2020 9:05 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah


[10/30/2020 9:06 PM] mx#5165
so basically we all agree on the same solution, just have different factors working inside in mind, that`s good, first pool operators will promote hard themselves to gain first mover advantage, we have one actually already with top optimizations, mhs is insisting he knows only about standard miners, similar with others, thats little strange but lets see


[10/30/2020 10:19 PM] kushti#0978
we need 2-3 pools at least at the moment of fork

Genesis for ETH 2.0, phase 0, the first step to moving to PoS will be Jan 3rd. Move to PoS is going to happen gradually in stages and PoW mining will continue for sometime. But this could offer an opportunity for Ergo marketing, right? As a alternative to mining ETH they can move to Ergo, a unique EUTXO smart contract DeFi platform with insane potential that will NEVER deviate from PoW. And fortunately this all coincides with our HF and inclusion of pools as well as other positive things happening around end of year. Its just a thought and I may be wrong. But if think this has merits, at some point soon probably want to start pushing this to people like Ergonauts, Coin Telegraph and mining pools etc.

Also might be interesting to Chinese ViaBTC mining pool which is same people and same CEO as CoinEx.  Coinex / ViaBTC is headquartered here in Shenzhen where I am also based and I went to their office and met their CEO on 17 July this year before we listed on Coinex.

@Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ yes, can be very good moment for Ergo as Ethereum going PoS, Grin / Ravencoin etc become tasteless , BCH and ETC are in total mess , so Ergo can be #1 high-potential PoW coin. 
On Coinex / ViaBTC, it would be good to find new partners among big Chinese miners.


[11/06/2020 2:02 AM] Justin1000#9555
Update on meetup last night
*Small meetup combined with Bitcoin meetup. Like 10-15 people there.
*But was good‚Ä¶was pumping Ergo hard for 3 hours. 
*BC Vault ‚Äì Met Dmitry Fedotov again. I have known him for like 2+ years since first started working on BC Vault HW wallet. I was really wary at first but have a little higher confidence now that is his the real deal. Since Jason davies is NEVER going to integrate ledger, I am talking with Dmitry about getting Ergo on. He is very positive. Told him first mover advantage, people want HW wallet, guy we sponsored for ledger not delivering‚Ä¶good for him to put it on. He seems quite keen! He is looking at docs he can find now. Maybe one of the devs can take a quick look at BV Vault to see if any red flags? Also, any links specifically related to wallets and HW integration I should point him to? He is looking for documentation now. Link to BC vault below. They also got twitter etc and are partnered with Changelly among others


[11/06/2020 2:02 AM] Justin1000#9555
*Dr Kent ‚Äì linkedin below. Doing medical data on hyperledger. Been looking at cardano but I think it is a functionality or cost issue that is preventing him from making too much progress there. He said Ergo looked really interesting because he could experiment and see if it could work for him cheaply because the transaction fees almost nothing. Said he had already been making money. Stores data on blockchain that can give user control over their medical data and then sell it or keep it private at their own discussion. I‚Äôve sent him links and stuff. He may want to join and build his thing out on Ergo. I told him most likely could get some support in understanding how to build on Ergo from Ergo devs since we want DAPP developers very bad right now. But we can see and I defer to you on that. 
*Jasmine ‚Äì China. Miner-related although didn‚Äôt say background. Probably knows China community very well. Got impression was part of something bigger than just herself. I told her all about Ergo  and asked her for help on China miners, pools, marketing. 
*James ‚Äì Some guy with a GPU ready to mine Ergo asap but needs the HF. He was already monitoring the mining channel. Not big though‚Ä¶haha like one gpu or a few‚Ä¶

Well, they are professional guys with integration experience, no freelancing enthusiasts like Jason Davies, who has the last mile problem it seems

Great, sounds good.


[11/11/2020 10:30 AM] kushti#0978
Cost can be about zero, if all the code is done (main concern of the guys is about the signature scheme) , and reportedly Jason Davies has the code needed. Trying to reach him

[11/18/2020 12:00 PM] Justin1000#9555
So we are going to start the mini China marketing ‚Äúcampaign‚Äù in like 1 week. Not entirely sure yet but seems it will be comprised of 3 or 4 articles. Each article will go to 2-3 wechat channels (we can reach 10 channels in total) and we are trying to find out the differences in the channels and their audiences so we can tailor the articles and decide exactly how many we need. the constraint and what we seem to be paying for is the number of channels we can post to.


[11/18/2020 12:00 PM] Justin1000#9555
My thinking is our 3 objectives in this campaign are 1) reach miners! Tell them hard fork is coming and ecosystem is opening up to miners big time; 2) reach developers ‚Äì tell them what they can build on  Ergo and where to go for tools. The tools and guides we‚Äôll just have to leave in English. Chinese developers shouldn‚Äôt have a problem with reading English technical stuff; 3) reach users and buyers so tell these guys what they can do with Ergo now and what they WILL be able to do in the near future.


[11/18/2020 12:00 PM] Justin1000#9555
Does that sound about right? I think these priorities and targets for marketing will change but for this particular campaign and where are in Ergo‚Äôs development, probably those are the priority targets in order.

{Reactions}
üëç (3) 

[11/18/2020 12:02 PM] Justin1000#9555
So I figure the way you can help is 1) Miners ‚Äì anything you have on how people can mine Ergo, guides, how it will work etc, please let @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ  and me know so we can incorporate links to these docs into the articles; 2) developer tools ‚Äì anything relevant here like the new stuff  @Robert K has been working on or stuff @kushti knows about to make things easier for developers, the playground all that stuff ‚Äì again links and any news etc so we can put in article(s) geared to developers. I myself have hard time keeping track of all those and which ones are most important to highlight.


[11/18/2020 12:02 PM] Justin1000#9555
That is main stuff. Probably for the articles given our man power constraints and Eva just getting settled, I‚Äôm thinking we rely heavily on the blog posts which have most all been translated to Chinese and incorporate those into the articles and then add on top of that some latest news, key developments and the links to the things above.


[11/18/2020 12:06 PM] Justin1000#9555
well Eva is thinking we need an intro to Ergo for Chinese users then go from there onto the more detailed stuff so we still need to talk more here and sort out some details...

[11/19/2020 11:32 AM] kushti#0978
but also interesting to know what holders do consider as important in China


[11/20/2020 3:06 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yep, @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ relayed York's contact. Have made contact. Not sure how much help he(she?) will be. But as you know already they will be running the testnet and giving feedback. Asked them for marketing points, intros etc and will look to stay in touch. Understand on the "ecosystem for decentralized finance with no strings attached". We'll discuss here with Eva.


[11/20/2020 3:33 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti Sure would be awesome to have Bitcoin gateways and able to tokenize bitcoin on Ergo, then use Ergo tools/apps on Bitcoin (like the mixer) and take the Bitcoin off. Bitcoin is pretty crap when it comes to any functionality and privacy but its looking more and more likely its going to remain as leading crypto as consensus seems to be forming among many leading fund managers and others that its a SOV and asset to be held at least small % in portfolio. And for a while the big story in crypto and focus may be on Bitcoin so if Bitcoin can be put on Ergo and Ergo can make up for some of Bitcoin's lack of functionality, could be key use cases that grab peoples' attention. Just some thoughts I had lately seeing the news flow and price moves on bitcoin. But imagine technical practicalities and timing of being able to do these things maybe not so ideal or easy.

[11/20/2020 5:30 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674

[11/20/2020 5:00 PM] Robert K#0722
New idea from Emurgo side for really getting a lot of excitement for the StableCoin/Ergo in general:


[11/20/2020 5:03 PM] Robert K#0722
We want to create a public event with a bunch of talks (aiming for 30 minutes each, 3-5 hours total) half explaining the Ergo ecosystem in general, and half explaining the stablecoin.


[11/20/2020 5:03 PM] Robert K#0722
We can likely get Bruno or someone from IOHK to do a talk about the stablecoin from a high-level equation perspective


[11/20/2020 5:03 PM] Robert K#0722
And that way we can get a lot of hype as well from IOHK/Emurgo marketing


[11/20/2020 5:04 PM] Robert K#0722
Other talks that would be important:
- An overview of the roadmap by someone on the ergo side


[11/20/2020 5:04 PM] Robert K#0722
- I can do a talk about the Ergo Protocol Framework and what it means for dApps


[11/20/2020 5:04 PM] Robert K#0722
- A talk about the implementation of the stablecoin in Ergo (Amitabh?)


[11/20/2020 5:05 PM] Robert K#0722
Some other more technical talks, maybe we could get Dionysis for NiPoPoWs?


[11/20/2020 5:06 PM] Robert K#0722
Maybe we can get Ollie(Sakata) to do a talk about the Ergo ecosystem from the community perspective


[11/20/2020 5:07 PM] Robert K#0722
And then I can probably do a closing segment for the event on the future of the Ergo & reiterate that I as a representatitve of the Ergo Foundation am inviting all developers to now come on into the ecosystem as we have just launched a new initiatve for giving out grants, and with the Ergo Protocol framework released, this is the opportune time.


[11/20/2020 5:08 PM] Robert K#0722
We don't have a lot of time to set this up, and we're starting to talk with our marketing people, but I think this is going to be important


[11/20/2020 5:08 PM] Robert K#0722
Otherwise the stablecoin release is just going to be another blog post/repo release


[11/20/2020 5:08 PM] Robert K#0722
And it's not going to get any attention just like Gravity


[11/20/2020 5:08 PM] Robert K#0722
Or gate.io


[11/20/2020 5:08 PM] Robert K#0722
Or half the stuff we release


[11/20/2020 5:09 PM] Robert K#0722
I'm not sure how open all the devs are to publicly speak, but we need to try and do our best to get as many interesting/technical talks so people can really see we have bright minds working on Ergo


[11/20/2020 5:12 PM] Robert K#0722
Could potentially also have a talk about "Headless dApps: A novel business model for the growing dApp Industry" which rolls off the idea of the EPF/releasing dApps with no front-ends and people monetizing creation of front-ends


[11/20/2020 7:36 PM] mx#5165

@mx I agree with you completely @mx . Robert is brilliant and the Ergonaut team is awesome too. But don't forget me and @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ . We remain dedicated to Ergo through the years. In China, got to build a parallel system. Can't just duplicate what we do internationally. we will do our best. haha, i was up all night pumping Ergo to some important people in HK (having fun too  üôÇ ) . But I go to mainland for 14 day quarantine in December. Anyway, lets make fireworks happen! The price is laughable! Waves is pumping...$6.92. I feel we are almost there. Someday Ergo will reach something approximating its potential and guess that will be insanely higher than today! And price does matter!! Need $ to fund stuff...we aren't boot strapping in 2009...its 2020!


[11/20/2020 7:58 PM] mx#5165

[11/20/2020 8:03 PM] Justin1000#9555

Like tonight while drinking Dom I didn't point out how superior Ergo was to Ethereum due to no need to have Ergs and no full predictability of cost before smart contract executes?

@Justin1000 It'd be awesome if you could do a talk. Pretty much on whatever topic you feel you'd be most comfortable/excited to tackle.


[11/20/2020 8:15 PM] Robert K#0722
> i am all for supporting all of the above by grants if possible, also with standard releases on a regular basis üëç  Robert seems the best marketing coordinator so far with Alex representing dev team while publicly speaking, don't see more people able explain Ergo to regular users, Sakata is nice support on high level and well english speaking
@mx I don't know what we could use grants for, but if anyone has any ideas we can brainstorm.


[11/20/2020 8:15 PM] mx#5165
@Justin1000 is also well speaking english, gave nice interview in the beginning


[11/20/2020 8:16 PM] Robert K#0722
Some topic ideas Nico came up with:


[11/20/2020 8:16 PM] Robert K#0722
```
Ergo (review of what has been done) or something like that
6:14
Ergo Roadmap 2021
(edited)
6:14
Ergo Stablecoin Launch and Roadmap
(edited)
6:15
Ergro <> Cardano Collaboration (basically how this benefit Cardano)
6:15
New Development tools (better name) but this is the release of some stuff for devs
6:15
Training Series for Devs
6:15
Grant Proposal for Developers
6:16
Special invite (someone from IOG like Bruno to talk about the stablecoin protocol)
6:16
Yoroi Ergo Integration and what‚Äôs to come
```


[11/20/2020 8:17 PM] Robert K#0722
One of our marketing people will help co-ordinate and work towards setting everything up


[11/20/2020 8:17 PM] Robert K#0722
For now I think if everyone here can brainstorm talk ideas, who could present, etc. that'd be super useful


[11/20/2020 8:18 PM] Robert K#0722
And we can start solidifying a plan as we enter next week (espeically with our call on Thursday @kushti )


[11/20/2020 8:20 PM] kushti#0978
@Robert K looks good, maybe also some talk on oracles? Latest developments, call for participation


[11/20/2020 8:20 PM] Robert K#0722
We'll have to deploy the new oracle pool before the talk


[11/20/2020 8:20 PM] Robert K#0722
But maybe we can do one on that too


[11/20/2020 8:21 PM] Robert K#0722
I'd just prefer to only do max 2 talks if we can help it, so let's see how it goes.


[11/20/2020 8:21 PM] mx#5165
@Robert K yes, that`s pretty much what you included in the post, Ergonauts are at the moment distributors as far i understand, they just drop content released randomly on 4chan, reddit, twitter etc


[11/20/2020 8:21 PM] Robert K#0722
Also we were thinking about maybe announcing the release of the stablecoin during the event.


[11/20/2020 8:22 PM] kushti#0978
Yes, maybe even 3 talks about stablecoin then?


[11/20/2020 8:23 PM] kushti#0978

@Robert K above supporting coordinating efforts and people involved like Bruno, Sakata, you, Alex, if there is stable connection for example with coin telegrapgh i think we should use it for important releases


[11/20/2020 8:26 PM] Robert K#0722
Sounds like a good idea


[11/20/2020 8:29 PM] mx#5165
free hype from IOHK/Emurgo marketing is great but we can boost it for sure with just Ergo releases

[11/22/2020 8:50 AM] mhs_sam#1471
What do you think about a dapp development contest, like a hackathon? It can be announced in the event. 
I mean a dev contest with three winners for example and some rules and maybe predefined goals. Also, with somehow big prizes for winners.
I think such a contest could attract lots of attention to ergo. This would also bring a lot of news and blog posts freely if the prizes are big enough to attract devs


[11/22/2020 12:55 PM] Robert K#0722
Great idea, I just think there isn't enough documentation to make that possible


[11/22/2020 12:55 PM] Robert K#0722
Which is what we have to solve first


[11/22/2020 12:55 PM] Robert K#0722
A new dev comes into the ecosystem, and then gets lost because there is no clear path for them


[11/22/2020 12:55 PM] Robert K#0722
This is why I've been pushing hard to address this


[11/22/2020 12:55 PM] Robert K#0722
With `EgroScript By Example` first


[11/22/2020 12:56 PM] Robert K#0722
And I'm writing tutorials for the Headless dApps as well


[11/22/2020 12:56 PM] Robert K#0722
But the barrier to entry is just way too high still, and I imagine if we try a contest no one will finish anything


[11/22/2020 12:57 PM] Robert K#0722
We need more friendly material, and not just random scattered documentation which has been more or less the standard


[11/22/2020 1:39 PM] mhs_sam#1471
I agree.


[11/22/2020 2:14 PM] Robert K#0722
I'm biased, but I think we should focus on the ErgoScript By Example repo as the go-to for learning how to write the on-chain smart contracts, and then continue writing material for the Ergo Headless dApp Framework (Rust) for the off-chain which I'm working on right now and will release by end of the month.


[11/22/2020 2:14 PM] Robert K#0722
The ergoscript playground + examples seems like the lowest time-sink for us to create instructional material for writing contracts.


[11/22/2020 2:15 PM] Robert K#0722
And I'm biased as I'm writing it, but I think this new headless dApp framework I'm developing will be the best off-chain experience for writing dApps. I've figured out a really simplified generalized interface for acquiring UTXOs that make developing front-ends a lot easier even for people who don't know too much about the underlying protocol.


[11/22/2020 2:17 PM] Robert K#0722
And the fact Rust is super portable, I think developing a dApp ecosystem around it is going to give us a lot of benefits as we narrow down from "here are 16 different ways to write your dApp", to, "To get started, learn ergoscript via these examples + whitepaper, and these tutorials for the off-chain code in rust".


[11/22/2020 2:22 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
> I'm trying to seduce ViaBTC / CoinEX guys to deepen our relationships, @Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ maybe we can reach their CEO also ?
@kushti yes. I think we would need  to approach him with a very detailed and specific proposal in mind, what would that be? Just educate him on the new algorithm and opportunity it presents for miners and pools? Anything else?


[11/23/2020 1:28 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti ViaBTC is already supporting HF right? So that is most urgent thing. I will be in mainland 2nd half of December. Maybe can get to know them better then or @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ could talk them earlier if already got some specific ideas.


[11/23/2020 1:29 AM] Justin1000#9555

[11/23/2020 11:10 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ from Darren (@Coinex):
"

We are looking forward to cooperating with ERG team again"


[11/23/2020 11:10 AM] kushti#0978

@mhs_sam I think apps contest is awesome idea. Let's plan it for February or March maybe ?


[11/23/2020 11:13 AM] kushti#0978
Much needed thing to attract devs is also to show how can they do a business on top of Ergo


[11/23/2020 11:14 AM] kushti#0978
So how to profit from contracts / UI


[11/23/2020 9:41 PM] kushti#0978

Hey Martin, how's it going?

This is a message from the head of marketing at Komodo
So they are doing a stress test on the 12th/13th and are doing a live stream for the duration. They have asked me to do a part, based on Ergo, which will be for 25-45 minutes.

My main concern was that the EF and the community would be unhappy with my appearance in their community, but if its on Ergo I guess its not too bad. However, I am looking for the EF's opinion for whether it is something that I should do or not.

We could market the summit there etc"

Eva seems enthusiastic so far. She's collecting materials and doing research. She will write a big article introducing Ergo to Chinese people that we will send to those 10 groups. Then she will manage the new people, wechat groups etc etc. This will be great way for her to get deep understanding of Ergo too. I'm going to just 1) provide her with some bullets of things we definitely want to cover in the article and 2) review the draft and give some comments. Rest will be up to her. Will see how she does.

normally we need someone from the ERGO team to run the gateway, and do the application for the ticker and the gateway. That's just to make sure that no bad player can create a proxy token for someone else.
If you want me to do it, i would need to get some sort of position within the ERGO team.
But let me discuss it internally with the rest of the core team and see what's the easiest way to do this.

Yes, I think absolutely mining is place to start. That is what we need most urgently. Also, I think that is ViaBTC's roots. What I recall about them is they were 100% or mostly controlled by Bitmain and were a big mining pool on BTC during 2017 and opposed segwit and I think they supported BCash. Sorry I can't write up a pitch to them but think the way I would approach it is 1) highlight current state of mining and problems - centralized, terrible order book, drag on price, lack of wide spread Ergo awareness among miner community; 2) how this HF will change everything in one shot; 3) details of hard fork and what they can help on - get on testnet, provide feedback, tell us if they are interested and how much hash power they can roughly commit at launch of HF; 4) make sure they know the opportunity - get in early as one of the first pools active on Ergo post HF. Ergo has huge catalysts in near term...things i can think of off top of head: 1) Hard fork, mass miner adoption, decentralization of mining; 2) oracle pools and stable coin to come out from Emurgo year-end/Jan2021; 3) new apps ‚Äì got 3-4 DAPPs only now ‚Äì really exciting ones but not many. Going to be tons more in next 6 months I think as Emurgo has been releasing a lot of developer tools and all the apps will be accessible via Yoroi; 4) marketing ‚Äì we are doing virtual Ergo summit on Dec 14th and a mini-China marketing campaign.


[11/27/2020 3:55 AM] Justin1000#9555
Even if they aren't williing to commit 100% right away, they should launch an official Ergo pool with ViaBTC branding or whatever on day 1 and make sure they are there so they can get in on the upside if things work out! And then there will be tons of other opportunities to work together on other stuff!

**DIGINEX: **Just had a call with their Sales Manager. These guys are serious operation. US$300mm market cap listed on NASDAQ now. Think their business has huge potential as they will be bridging the gap between traditional finance/investors and crypto. I met their most senior guys before...pretty cool people although they definitely aren't cypherpunk types. I pushed Ergo to him hard and sent him a bunch of info. he said would have his guys take a look. I told them anyone can build on Ergo and you can do it in a regulated transparent way if you like. And also what we need now most urgently would be working together on marketing to raise Ergo's profile. Will let you know if hear back more. Definitely think we should try and help them if they need anything or want to explore!

Supposed to have a call with this guy "Juwan" who apparently is the "US trade emissary for blockchain in Asia" and has full sales and marketing platform. Since we can't pay whatever huge fees they probably normally charge, my pitch will be for them to take a look at ergo and if like it buy some because it is so insanely cheap versus potential...then help us market it and incentives aligned that way. Not sure will work but seems only way. Let you know how it goes.

The story of the Hardfork? How first coin ever to try non-outsouceability, why tried it and problems with miner centralization which led to low miner adoption and bad order book. but this will all change soon with the first and hopefully only ergo HF and HF could be catalyst for massive growth in community and mindshare


[11/29/2020 4:01 AM] Justin1000#9555
But there is a lot else going on with app development side and making more accessible to developers. But not sure that as interesting to talk about as the HF. Or too much to put in one article  they should 2 spaced by a week!


[11/29/2020 4:02 AM] Justin1000#9555
Hope they do one at least.


[11/29/2020 6:06 AM] Justin1000#9555
I feel as though the HF needs to me marketed HARD. The price is so low (market cap 1/500th of Cardno!!!) and price chart bad - tough for people psychologically. Would be cool if can cast the HF as a Ergo "reborn" type catalyst making past price performance irrelevant. And it comes about same time as all these other catalysts I mentioned earlier then that is even more the case.

[11/29/2020 8:29 AM] Justin1000#9555
Anyway that is my recommendation its about article content. If about ways to contribute to cointelegraph, what about offering to have some Ergo core devs be technical contributors to CT? So when they run into hard to understand technical issues they can ask @kushti @Robert K dmitry @morphic etc. Then to extent you give some input on article they can site at bottom " with contribution from xyz, a core developer and board member at ergo foundation. I have seen this before for bitcoin magazine


[11/29/2020 8:29 AM] Justin1000#9555
Maybe even write occasional technical article for them on cutting edge developments in the space


[11/29/2020 8:30 AM] Justin1000#9555

[11/29/2020 8:32 AM] Justin1000#9555
But would have to be strictly impartial and avoid saying.anything bad about other platforms or good about ergo. Have to stay focused on technical stuff for whatever article writing or contributing to


[11/29/2020 5:45 PM] kushti#0978
agree very much. I think Jan 10-15th is best time for HF (after Western & Russian holidays and before Chinese New Year). Then before mid-December we're promoting Ergo Summit and stablecoin launch and after we promote HF. 

I propose to call HF the "hardening upgrade". With this fork we're improving PoW, opening mining for pools, fixing some issues, opening possibilities for sub-block confirmation protocols (Bitcoin-NG or Flux, topic for research in 2021 ) and improved ErgoTree in following-up soft-fork.

For PoW, we need for promotion among miners. Autolykos v2 is now targeting GPUs with 2+ GB RAM, the niche which is becoming more or less free now with ETH/RVN targeting top-level GPUs (ETC is targeting the same niche after the last fork, so we're going to compete with ETC and must win!)


[11/29/2020 7:49 PM] Robert K#0722
Maybe you could do a talk about the HF, titled, "A Breakdown Of The 2021 Ergo Hardening Upgrade"


[11/29/2020 8:27 PM] kushti#0978
Separate from the 2021 roadmap ?


[11/29/2020 8:49 PM] Robert K#0722
Yeah, if you think that makes sense.


[11/29/2020 8:49 PM] Robert K#0722

[11/29/2020 8:50 PM] Robert K#0722
And you focus on just what the hardfork would do/enable.


[11/29/2020 8:50 PM] Robert K#0722
Then the 2021 roadmap you can talk about the whole ecosystem's 2021 plan


[11/29/2020 8:51 PM] Robert K#0722
So that would be a list of things like the DEX, full stablecoin implementation, headles dApps, dApp competitions, hardening upgrade, etc.

And you touch on each one for a short period of time.


[11/30/2020 10:01 AM] kushti#0978
Sounds nice, so two talks for me ?


[11/30/2020 10:57 AM] Robert K#0722
Could you do one more?


[11/30/2020 10:59 AM] Robert K#0722
So:
- `Ergo 101: The basics` (first talk, would be good to have you do it as most people know you in Ergo)
- `The Upcoming Ergo Hardening Upgrade - How It Will Change The Ecosystem From Top To Bottom` (Potential new title, trying to make it more exciting)
- `2021 Ergo Roadmap Reveal` (Final talk)


[11/30/2020 11:20 AM] kushti#0978
ah alright )


[11/30/2020 11:21 AM] kushti#0978
@morphic sad you're not supporting us


[11/30/2020 11:45 AM] kushti#0978
@mhs_sam @Robert K @Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ @morphic @mx and after the fork , let's focus on developers acquisition: hackathon, grants for dapps, tutorials, showcases on how to do business on top of Ergo etc. 
It can be a topic for next Ergo Summit, which should be organized by EF & community

@kushti Did you ask the Gravity guys about doing a talk?


[11/30/2020 12:57 PM] kushti#0978
@Robert K yes, they agreed on


[11/30/2020 12:59 PM] Robert K#0722
Alright great!


[11/30/2020 1:00 PM] Robert K#0722
Did you mention we're aiming for the 7th to have the pre-recorded talks ready?


[11/30/2020 1:01 PM] kushti#0978
The guy is disappeared a bit after the agreement, so not yet


[11/30/2020 1:01 PM] kushti#0978
trying to reach him


[11/30/2020 9:25 PM] kushti#0978
CoinTelegraph CBDO was very supportive:
 - CT will cover Ergo Summit. However, he suggested to invite Charles or any other big stars in the space to get quotes on the stablecoin to publish. So let's try to invite Charles!
 -  There's a chance to get into HitBTC & Bitcoin.com (the same engine they shared). 
 -  He will connect me with their Chinese guy (Russian, but living in China for 9 years). They guy has a lot of connections with exchanges (Huobi, OKEX etc). 
 - He also suggested to establish a legal entity for Ergo Foundation in Liechtenstein . He has some connections there.


[12/02/2020 4:22 AM] Justin1000#9555
Why are we calling it Hardening Upgrade? Doesnt sound catchy to me. Not saying I have brilliant ideas myself though. I was  just thinking maybe "Ergo Reborn Upgrade". Make as big a deal as possible every single aspect like opening up to miners pools and every new thing enabled by the upgrade. Also gives a chance to market the whole platform all over again.


[12/02/2020 4:24 AM] Justin1000#9555
Want people to have another look at Ergo. To justify them buying in despite the not so attractive char. Cant recall details but Neo was originally called ant shares and was at like a dollar or less and shot up to like 50 dollars after their upgrade and rebranding


[12/02/2020 4:24 AM] Justin1000#9555
Not saying expect anything near that extreme but it does come to mind.


[12/02/2020 8:02 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti FYI by accident, I have made contact with CT guys in China. I contacted this guy Hank who was at our meetup in Shanghai and told him I would be in mainland soon and turns out he joined CT just 2 weeks ago! Now I am on Chat with their China CBDO (Tracy) and China CEO (Vadim). Vadim said just informed about Ergo recently by Sergey. Anyway, seems i'll be getting on a call with them and will have a dialogue. They have a summit on the 22nd in Sanya. I should be able to make it if they confirm I am invited. Maybe @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ can go too...guess find out when he comes down from the Kung Fu mountain.


[12/02/2020 9:12 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 we can't efficient marketing machine for rebranding, also, no need for it. All we can do in current situation is promotion around miners. 
HF is minimal, aside of PoW change, but opening up possibilities for future painless upgrades. Thus the name.


[12/02/2020 9:13 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ how Chinese marketing is going ?


[12/02/2020 9:19 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 yeah so I'm in touch Sergey (CT CBDO). Soon will be in touch with Vadim.


[12/02/2020 9:25 AM] kushti#0978
We badly need for new partnerships I guess. So let's try to get CT & ViaBTC / Coinex (so Bitmain) + some cryptofunds after these two.  Bitmain is pulling support from Bitcoin Cash now, ETH is starting switching to PoW so big chance to get into top5 PoW coins in 2021.


[12/02/2020 10:03 AM] Robert K#0722
I think we can try to spin it as a new Era for Ergo

{Reactions}
üëç 

[12/02/2020 10:05 AM] Robert K#0722
So the Ergo Summit 50/50 might be delayed due to the stablecoin running into legal issues last-minute.


[12/02/2020 10:05 AM] Robert K#0722
So what I'm thinking is that we might be able to time the Summit with the hard fork.


[12/02/2020 10:06 AM] Robert K#0722
And with the recent release of headless dApps + Ergo-lib rust + with yoroi dApp bridge being worked on + the tx assembler being available, we have the ability for us to move into a new era of dApps as well.


[12/02/2020 10:07 AM] Robert K#0722
And so I think we need to try and be serious here, and come up with a naming scheme denoting that up until this point, we were in the "bootstrap era"(come up with a better name, say something mythological or whatever)


[12/02/2020 10:07 AM] Robert K#0722
And now we're moving into the "build" era (new name)


[12/02/2020 10:09 AM] Robert K#0722
And with moving into this new era, I think we can stress 3 points:
- The HF is reinvigorating the Ergo mining community, allowing everyone to join in easily
- The dApp tooling and educational material is now at a point where it is accesible for new dApp developers to jump in
- The EF is creating a new dApp/ecosystem development initiative and handing out a lot of grants

[12/02/2020 10:09 AM] Justin1000#9555
yeah, rebranding is not what i mean for sure. New Era like Robert just mentioned sounds right though.


[12/02/2020 10:10 AM] Justin1000#9555
Eva is writing that long article. Seems to be working hard as far as I can tell on researching Ergo and is asking a lot of questions. Probably the article will be blasted out on the around Dec 10th then she will need to be very busy managing the chats as hopefully will be a lot of new joiners (as discussed before‚Ä¶for wechat‚Ä¶chat management takes lot more time).

@Robert K can I share stablecoin specs with anon devs and Vladimir? Vladimir will do marketing proposal and send to funds and partners. anons will start thinking about ecosystem around the stablecoin


[12/02/2020 10:51 AM] Robert K#0722
I'll ask Nico to get the OK, but I'm pretty sure yes.


[12/02/2020 10:52 AM] Robert K#0722
I think you can probably send to Anons/Vladimir right now, but maybe wait until I get the OK to start sending it to funds/partners


[12/02/2020 10:52 AM] kushti#0978
@Robert K I see, thanks!


[12/02/2020 10:53 AM] Justin1000#9555
I have wondered about this occasionally. He might like Ergo as alternative to Bitcoin and could potentially be hugely helpful. Downside risk I most concerned about is he is a very "loud" guy and not sure what direction he would take the community in. But probably he couldn't or wouldn't do anything harmful. Probably worth reaching out too...


[12/02/2020 2:09 PM] Robert K#0722
Nico said he wouldn't rush to send proposals to funds/partners.


[12/02/2020 2:10 PM] Robert K#0722
With the current legal uncertainty we're in right now, we kind of need to get to a stable point before we can move forward.


[12/02/2020 3:39 PM] kushti#0978
@Robert K so a guy Sven from Liechtenstein recommended by CBDO of CT may help reportedly with both things (legal and funds).  He worked for Ernst & Young and other big names, and also for long time in crypto. According to him, KYC requirements likely can be bypassed if there's no fiat gateway maintained.


[12/02/2020 5:08 PM] Robert K#0722
Hmm interesting.


[12/02/2020 5:08 PM] Robert K#0722
I'm talking with Nico in 1 hour and will let him know.


[12/02/2020 6:55 PM] Robert K#0722
@kushti Okay, so we are going to keep talking with the IOG lawyers from Emurgo's side to see how comfortable they are with going forward with different options.


[12/02/2020 6:56 PM] Robert K#0722
It seems like they really want to ensure we have the potential for the protocol to support KYC (even if we don't implement it), and so maybe just writing a spec for how KYC could be done would make them happy.


[12/02/2020 6:56 PM] Robert K#0722
We can talk tomorrow in our call with you/me/nico and get more clarity.


[12/02/2020 6:58 PM] Robert K#0722
The current plan from here that seems to make the most sense:
1. Figure out what IOG legal will be happy with by EoY.
2. Do a marketing campaign/release of Ergo StableCoin specs/high level overview + me doing videos explaining both
3. Release stablecoin Q1 2021 once we figure out legal/address that.


[12/02/2020 6:59 PM] Robert K#0722
----


[12/02/2020 7:00 PM] Robert K#0722
And in regards to the Ergo Summit, Nico made a good point that it might be best to have the Hard Fork happen approximately 1 week after the summit (even if we have to delay it)


[12/02/2020 7:01 PM] Robert K#0722
So the idea here would be to have the HF initiate the new "era", and the Ergo Summit is effectively an event that explains what we accomplished in the 1st era (bootstrap era) and what we can expect from the 2nd era.


[12/02/2020 7:05 PM] Robert K#0722
An idea that came about: maybe we can even come up with some sort of 3rd era as well for the farther future, and so we can give a super high-level scope vision to the projects in the form of "eras".


[12/02/2020 7:07 PM] kushti#0978
Ah yes


[12/02/2020 7:07 PM] kushti#0978
Next eras can be concluded:


[12/02/2020 7:17 PM] kushti#0978
1st era = mainnet launch, non-outsourceable pow experiment, first contracts and apps
2nd era = outsourceable pow, serious DeFi, nipopow clients
3rd era = sub-block confirmations, JIT costing

{Reactions}

[12/02/2020 7:21 PM] Robert K#0722
Random wacky idea: What if we name the eras in the context of building a spaceship that will fly into space to get to the moon? And so we can start with a "Launchpad Era", then have a "Rocket Era", then have a "Propulsion Era", then have a "Rocket Fuel Era", then have an "Escape Velocity Era", then have an "Space Voyage Era", then "Moon Colonization Era", then "Interstellar Space Travel Era", etc. etc.


[12/02/2020 7:21 PM] Robert K#0722
And what's cool with this is that we have a mascot now, an Ergonaut.


[12/02/2020 7:21 PM] Robert K#0722
And so for each of these eras we can create a graphic that represents that era, where the Ergonaut is drawn to be building/doing whatever that era is called.


[12/02/2020 7:22 PM] Robert K#0722
And so in the "Launchpad Era", we have an image of the Ergonaut finishing off a rocket launchpad.


[12/02/2020 7:22 PM] Robert K#0722
In the "Rocket Era" we have an image of the Ergonaut putting the finishing touches to a rocket/spaceship.


[12/02/2020 7:23 PM] Robert K#0722
"Propulsion Era" -> Ergonaut is adding propulsion rockets to the main part of the spaceship/rocket (the center one that would have a window).


[12/02/2020 7:23 PM] Robert K#0722
"Rocket Fuel Era" -> Ergonaut filling up the rocket with rocket fuel.


[12/02/2020 7:25 PM] Robert K#0722
"Escape Velocity Era" -> Rocket flying off the launch pad towards the sky (with the Ergonaut inside as seen through the window in the rocket/spaceship)


[12/02/2020 7:25 PM] Robert K#0722
"Space Voyage Era" -> Rocket flying through space towards the moon


[12/02/2020 7:25 PM] Robert K#0722
etc. etc.


[12/02/2020 7:26 PM] Robert K#0722
So we have both a narrative + visual representations + quirky/interesting names for each Era that make them memorable together with out mascot.


[12/02/2020 7:28 PM] Robert K#0722
And we can stuff whatever features/dApps/developments into each era as long as they sort of make sense of being at the part of the narrative (ex. don't focus on JIT costing when your in the escape velocity era as that doesn't really make sense, but in the Propulsion era where you are adding a propulsion system to the rocket)


[12/02/2020 7:33 PM] kushti#0978
sounds good


[12/02/2020 7:33 PM] kushti#0978

I took a look at NXT at some point like 7 years ago or so


[12/02/2020 9:23 PM] kushti#0978
What can be next dapps for our anons ?


[12/03/2020 7:27 AM] Robert K#0722
Hmm, related to this question, maybe for future DeFi projects, we can create the protocol/headless dApps, and anons deploy/produce frontends?


[12/03/2020 7:27 AM] Robert K#0722
It seems much of the legal impetus ends up being in the hands of the deployer, so just a thought to keep in mind when treading anything that seems controversial.


[12/03/2020 7:31 AM] Robert K#0722
Personally I think we need to work on marketing the current dApps 100x more, and building out the ecosystem to allow new devs to onboard as the highest priority.

{Reactions}
‚ù§Ô∏è 

[12/03/2020 7:32 AM] Robert K#0722
Would it be possible to ask one of the anons to create a simple headless dApp + a graphical frontend for it? (If they're willing to code in rust/learn the framework)


[12/03/2020 7:33 AM] Robert K#0722
I think it could be not too hard to convert the crowdfunding CLI I created in 2019 in Rust into a headless dApp.


[12/03/2020 7:54 AM] Robert K#0722
-------
I'd actually say it'd be better if we stop creating new dApps, and just spend Q1 2021:
- Marketing the **heck** out of every piece of tooling we have & dApps that are released (will help with the Sigmaverse being released). I mean creating overview videos explaining what each tool/dApp does, why it's novel and cool.
- Create explanatory guides for how to use **everything** we have released (ex. people are asking for guides for hosting auctions). It's cool we have like 30 different tools and a bunch of different dApps, but no one understands how to do anything. I think maybe using the idea `simgaverse.org` domain and creating an educational section like we thought about before, `edu.sigmaverse.org`, where we have all the explanatory material in one place could be a solid option.
- Creating a streamlined/guided approach for developers to enter into the ecosystem (and at least curosory explanation of all of the tooling we have available). I think we could use `dev.sigmaverse.org` for this potentially. And in this part of the website we could have 3 paths for users: 1. How to create dApps from 0 to finish (we can likely reuse my headless dApp tutorials for this, and keep adding on to them). 2. How to learn ErgoScript (Can be based on text from whitepapers + include link to ErgoScript by example) 3. Developer Tooling Repository (links to all developer tooling that exists)

And so maybe we can treat the `sigmaverse.org`  website as the "application-level" website for where people need to get to learn how to build/use the ecosystem on the application level, while `ergoplatform.org` is the "protocol level" website which talks about primarily everything about the blockchain itself/papers/etc.

{Reactions}
‚ù§Ô∏è 

[12/03/2020 12:01 PM] kushti#0978
@Robert K agree very much, what currently done in the protocol and apps ecosystem already is totally undersold


[12/03/2020 12:02 PM] kushti#0978
While folks are requiring for new things for the sake of getting hopium


[12/03/2020 12:03 PM] kushti#0978
New apps are also needed


[12/03/2020 12:03 PM] kushti#0978
But getting users and devs involved must be priority #1

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[12/03/2020 12:04 PM] kushti#0978
For getting devs I guess we need to create business stories


[12/03/2020 12:04 PM] kushti#0978
E.g. how mixer is doing profit


[12/03/2020 12:05 PM] kushti#0978
How UIs can profit from headless dapps and so on


[12/03/2020 12:11 PM] Robert K#0722
I think for getting devs currently the biggest hurdle is that it's kind of impossible to get started.


[12/03/2020 12:12 PM] Robert K#0722
It took me months to understand how contracts work, how data is encoded in registers, how you have to design txs in order for contracts to validate, what language/what the heck do you write everything in, how do you interact with a full node (and for what?), etc. etc.


[12/03/2020 12:12 PM] Robert K#0722
You guys deal with this stuff non-stop, so it may seem kind of obvious, but it's literally like a wall of information scattered in 20 different places for anyone just looking at the project.


[12/03/2020 12:14 PM] Robert K#0722
This is one of the reasons why I spent a lot of time writing the tutorials for headless dApps, and trying to come up with a unified interface for finding UTXOs (`BoxSpec` structs), so we can just sell people a single method of building dApps that is cross-platform, is streamlined, has good educational material, and wraps everything together.


[12/03/2020 12:15 PM] Robert K#0722
And since I also created the Ergo Node Interface lib in Rust, we have enough of the basic functionality to make this a viable path for people to come into the ecosystem.


[12/03/2020 12:16 PM] Robert K#0722
So imo, I think teaching people to create headless dApps is a good first step (they build off-chain code that interacts with a real node and understand how all of those pieces work). And then teaching ErgoScript on top of that allows them to move forward and build more complex contracts and escalate.


[12/03/2020 12:18 PM] kushti#0978
Yes. We also have ErgoAppKit by @morphic which seems to be abandoned these days, was used in building mixer / ZKT


[12/03/2020 12:19 PM] Robert K#0722
Ah right.


[12/03/2020 12:19 PM] kushti#0978
I will submit DEX contract with buyback guarantee into ErgoScript by the Example soon


[12/03/2020 12:19 PM] kushti#0978
and then will try to submit to there


[12/03/2020 12:19 PM] Robert K#0722
I think the problem is we didn't do any educational push for AppKit either, and since it's in scala too (not the most popular language), as such it's just not got much attention.


[12/03/2020 12:20 PM] Robert K#0722
It seems the reoccuring theme in the Ergo project is that stuff gets released and no one knows anything about it/does anything with it (other than a few dedicated people).


[12/03/2020 12:20 PM] Robert K#0722
Which is what happened to the ErgoScript playground until October when I came up with the ergoscript by example repo.


[12/03/2020 12:20 PM] kushti#0978
So let's update ESBtE and Headless Apps repo regularly


[12/03/2020 12:21 PM] kushti#0978
But devs also need to see why to create apps


[12/03/2020 12:21 PM] kushti#0978
so profit or social good


[12/03/2020 12:21 PM] Robert K#0722
Yep


[12/03/2020 12:22 PM] Robert K#0722
Which is I think one of the good parts of headless dApps, is that we can attract developers with profit motives from both smart contracts devs & frontend devs


[12/03/2020 12:22 PM] Robert K#0722
dApp devs -> You can get free marketing/other people to build your frontend for your dApp because they have a profit motive


[12/03/2020 12:23 PM] Robert K#0722
frontend devs -> You can get a % fee and earn some money if your frontend is used by users


[12/03/2020 12:23 PM] Robert K#0722
And frontend devs then have incentives to also do marketing in addition to the protocol devs.


[12/03/2020 12:25 PM] Robert K#0722
But this is also addressing my first point, I think we have to create a very user-friendly website that looks good and is a developer portal of sorts.


[12/03/2020 12:25 PM] Robert K#0722
Github repos work, but they look ugly and make the project seem unfinished to most people.


[12/03/2020 12:27 PM] Robert K#0722
We need to have a centralized place (like potentially the sigmaverse) where we can trivially forward everyone to, and they're greeted with a great visually pleasing UI that clearly has a section for them to get started building Ergo dApps.


[12/03/2020 12:28 PM] Robert K#0722
Until we have something like that, imo, we won't attract anyone, and saying there's profit potential won't mean anything when people can make shitcoins on Ethereum in 1 days work and potentially make thousands of dollars with a lot less work.


[12/03/2020 12:29 PM] Robert K#0722
We're in the early days, and I don't think we're going to attract anyone who's hyper-profit motivated from a developer standpoint, but I do agree that emphasizing that profit is possible too is enticing.


[12/03/2020 12:35 PM] kushti#0978
Yeah agree


[12/03/2020 12:37 PM] kushti#0978
so lets focus on polishing what we have now + Sigmaverse


[12/03/2020 12:37 PM] kushti#0978
anon-real is going to do a website where users can issue tokens etc


[12/03/2020 12:37 PM] kushti#0978
without a node


[12/03/2020 12:45 PM] Robert K#0722
Oh awesome


[12/03/2020 12:45 PM] Robert K#0722
That'd be really great.


[12/03/2020 12:47 PM] Robert K#0722
So does this plan make sense to expand Sigmaverse into an application-level website with lots of educational material?


[12/03/2020 12:57 PM] kushti#0978
to me yes


[12/03/2020 12:58 PM] kushti#0978
@mhs_sam @morphic @mx @Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ your opinion ?

Hell yes. Sigmaverse is great name and  its separate from the main website and brand. Role it out ASAP. Need these devs to start rolling out app after app. All on sigmaverse and integrated into yoroi etc. And hope they can make big money ASAP too!


[12/03/2020 3:08 PM] Justin1000#9555
Hope more anon devs appear soon!


[12/03/2020 3:09 PM] Justin1000#9555
Need more anon devs


[12/03/2020 4:07 PM] Justin1000#9555
Should get Roger Ver on this. I haven't talked to him for years. But I might be able to reach one of his lieutenants. Somebody needs to talk to him. We need some hype!! Ergo is ready to go right??? On protocol layer? After fork at least? Or I am missing something? If it is ready then we just need developers and hype and price going up like a rocket. everybody will flood in. Robert seems to be right...one big hurdle is developer tools not available so take care of that with Sigmaverse etc ASAP. Then @kushti telling people they can make money is right attitude but again...without the hype...it wont' be enough in this environment with all these crappy overhyped projects. We need a flood of people coming!!!! Its time!


[12/03/2020 4:15 PM] Justin1000#9555
Should try and get Roger in now before ERG price goes up. He will probably have same feeling he had when he bought Bitcoin at a dollar.


[12/03/2020 4:16 PM] Robert K#0722
That would be great if we could


[12/03/2020 4:24 PM] Justin1000#9555
hmmmm, yeah i still got his contacts. damn. met him like 5x and talked to him a lot in HK and Tokyo but problem is been 3+ years now since last time! will try to reach one of his lieutenants first probably.


[12/03/2020 4:51 PM] mx#5165
agree that Sigmaverse is very much needed for user friendly educational purposes for builders, in Ergo case even experienced devs need to be led like children from start to the end, self discovery could take forever otherwise, i think Sigmaverse could be also potentially a place to show some differences from other projects in dev or edu section, we have like one comparison with Chainlink so far, HF will help with standard marketing but devs still need to see why to build on Ergo, not on other 100 chains and spend lots time on learning first, in Ergo case they need to be social good + profit at the same time


[12/03/2020 5:35 PM] mhs_sam#1471
I am totally agree with what Robert said. Specially the part that he recommends stop creating news dapps. That's why I proposed the hackathon. I think the EF should work totally on the lower levels and the dapp creation should be incentivized for outside devs. 
Btw, creating some headless apps and teaching people on how to build on ERGO is our priority. so we can prepare the protocol and contract specifications, and even some headless PoC and motivate other devs to jump in and build on top. I guess something similar happened to mixer, when the very first anon implemented a simple mixer PoC and then the anon team appeared and built the ErgoMixer.
 Sigmaverse could be a good platform to start and focus on such things. however, I do not like its name personally. It's a great name on its own but how can someone can make a connection with ergo? btw, there could be some PoCs or even simple contracts to be used by others.
about the Roger Ver, I guess it's a big decision to make, since lots of people imagine him as a scammer (I'm not giving my opinion here), so FOMO from him may have a fast price raise and a lot of hype, but lots of people will keep away from ergo since he promoted it.

another thing to mention is that as mentioned above by Robert, the learning gap of ergo is large. One problem could be its fantastic extended UTXO model which was very new to me. Lots of devs cannot imagine building complex contract on UTXO model since their mind is biased with account based models like ETH. I think this one can be solved by the above idea of building headless apps and PoCs (likely replicating successful ETH dapps).
the second gap is due to ergo's languages, Rust and Scala. I can re-implement anything in python for example. so maybe, if desired, having libraries in other languages may lower this gap. As I said, I can do it in python.

[12/03/2020 5:47 PM] Robert K#0722
Python would be cool, but it will make the headless dApps less useful since you can't just compile to whatever target you want and use it in other languages. The nice part about Rust is we can go to WASM -> JS and then create web dApp frontends.


[12/03/2020 5:47 PM] Robert K#0722
But glad to hear you guys rae on board with the idea of the sigmaverse


[12/03/2020 5:47 PM] Robert K#0722
In regards to the name not having Ergo in it, I think it's fine personally. It makes things more interesting while still using a core concept of Ergo.


[12/03/2020 5:48 PM] Robert K#0722
In Cardano for example lots of projects are named random things


[12/03/2020 5:48 PM] Robert K#0722
And it's still relevant for most people


[12/03/2020 5:49 PM] mhs_sam#1471
the idea of sigmaverse is awesome and very needed at this point.
about the name, I agree, I just have a feeling and the name is very good on its own.


[12/03/2020 5:51 PM] mhs_sam#1471
ah, about the era, I like the idea, but I have some concerns about it.
the eras could not make people think that the product is not ready, even in these early eras. Having lots of eras may give that feeling that its a poc and it is not ready and we should wait to some later eras. btw, this can be managed well by good naming and mascots I guess


[12/03/2020 5:57 PM] Justin1000#9555
I think it is cool the name is totally different than Ergo in this case. People will be like "wow, this awesome, oh what is Ergo?" Or something like thatüôÇ

I think we should only ship with 3 eras, and the rest are for the farther future.


[12/03/2020 6:23 PM] Robert K#0722
And so the idea is we have a near-infinite number of eras possible, so even if we want to keep going with eras 10 years later, we can.


[12/03/2020 6:24 PM] Robert K#0722
I do agree throwing a lot of eras might startle people, so we just have the "launchpad era" which is up until the the hard fork, then the next era, and maybe a 3rd era for the farther future (ex. 1 year out)


[12/03/2020 6:27 PM] Robert K#0722
So then is there anyone we could give a grant to (in addition to DeadIT) who could help make these altenative sections of the sigmaverse?


[12/03/2020 6:28 PM] Robert K#0722
DeadIT is currently working on the original idea/"front page", which is effectively a dApp explorer.


[12/03/2020 6:28 PM] Robert K#0722
It would be good to ship with at least the dev section (and hopefully edu section as well) for the Summit


[12/03/2020 8:55 PM] kushti#0978
on protocol and protocol client level things are pretty much alright now, we'll work on improvements for years, but nodes are working pretty well now, %% of code documented and audited again grows every day, so yeah, things are going quite well here


[12/03/2020 8:56 PM] kushti#0978
Aside of PoW change, there will be some fixes and improvements in the protocol, but they are not visible to users / app devs


[12/03/2020 9:50 PM] morphic#4133
An year ago I thought Appkit was going to be a platform for dApps, but unfortunately GraalVM doesn't support ARM, so the pass to mobile was unclear (closed), as well as pass to Web. So user side UI is a problem with Appkit. 
It is however can be used on server side. 
And it might have been overlooked, but Appkit is not Scala based, it is Java based. All it's APIs is Java friendly and as a result they can be used from many different languages, but under GraalVM (everywhere one is able to run GraalVM)
Here you can find a Python example as well as Ruby, JS and evan C/C++. https://github.com/aslesarenko/ergo-appkit-examples


[12/03/2020 10:00 PM] morphic#4133
For Playground one thing can be done rather easily I think. An option to run scripts with real blockchain. This can easily be done by lowering the Playground object into Appkit API.

[12/03/2020 10:00 PM] Robert K#0722
If we were to write educational material for AppKit, I'd highly recommend we try to copy the BoxSpec design pattern so that we don't have to teach people how to manually get utxos themselves.


[12/03/2020 10:01 PM] morphic#4133
The programming abstractions of Playground are mostly the same as those in Appkit only expressed using Scala idiomatic way, rather then Java, but they are isomorphic so to say.


[12/03/2020 10:06 PM] morphic#4133
The goal of Appkit was to expose the UTXO model in its entirety in a more or less friendly way and general way (supporting everything possible in Ergo at lease potentially). Not to introduce new higher level programming abstractions. They can be added for sure as a new layer on top of  Appkit API.


[12/03/2020 10:10 PM] morphic#4133
Not sure this is the right place for this discussion. And to be clear, I don't think it make sense to put much efforts in Appkit now. It is better to have a robust and usable Rust library with ready to use project templates for every platform. So that ideally getting started instructions like: 
1) choose your platform 
2) clone example repository 
3) run `cargo run` 
4) replace example with your logic 
5) go to step 3) and iterate

Would be good to have it in order  to test timelocks


[12/04/2020 7:58 AM] Robert K#0722
Right, sounds good. I do think we need actual educational material past just templates, because the "replace example with your logic" part is very non-trivial to anyone entering the ecosystem.


[12/04/2020 9:00 AM] morphic#4133
Yes,  for sure. At the same time, the steps above can provide a "wow" effect. I think it will be highly motivating to spend up to 5 minutes and get working desktop App, another 5 minutes and the same App runs on mobile and so on. Basically putting aside all other prerequisites for Android, iOS, Web etc development. It is very encouraging experience if you can spend a couple of hours  and get a running app on ALL platforms. Good starting point. Then good documentation and tutorials come into play definitely.


[12/04/2020 9:10 AM] morphic#4133
BTW, this kind of experience Flatter is providing. You can run all the same UI code on all the platforms (except embedded ARM Cortex-M and the like).


[12/04/2020 9:14 AM] Robert K#0722
Hmm, interesting.


[12/04/2020 9:17 AM] Robert K#0722
Would be interesting if we could integrate rust + Flutter for dApp devs.


[12/04/2020 9:17 AM] Robert K#0722
Though I think web dApps are still probably going to be more popular of an approach.


[12/04/2020 9:20 AM] Robert K#0722
Anyways, the point that's clear is that we need to solidify a real vision for the project, creating a good on-boarding process for newbies, and do a lot of marketing of what we build, rather than the chaotic random developing and just doing 1 tweet about it.

There's just a severe lack of planning on any kind of marketing or grander idea of what to do with what we have.


[12/04/2020 9:27 AM] Robert K#0722
Even if we just made a 10 minute video every 2 weeks talking about the latest updates on the tooling/libraries, that would help everyone see stuff is going on.


[12/04/2020 9:28 AM] Robert K#0722
I think the failure to consider marketing what is being built (besides it being just an afterthought you throw 1 random tweet out about/post on telegram) is kind of why we've totally failed to build a community.


[12/04/2020 9:30 AM] Robert K#0722
We're not in early days crypto where random devs will just stumble on your project if you keep developing stuff. There's too many projects now so the space is quite cluterred and we can't be naive and keep moving forward like this.


[12/04/2020 1:26 PM] kushti#0978
Yes, very much agree with @Robert K .

IMHO, what do we need to do:

1) Do Open-Source 101 properly (told Denys about doing nice README, @morphic sigma-state readme is still from 2017). 
2) Put all the developments, tutorials etc into awesome-ergo for starters
3) Plan sigmaverse development
4) Plan headless app and ErgoScript examples for some time
5) Present developments (I plan to start with a video on 3.3.7 release)
6) Have some marketing tips, not random posting of something 
7) Have dates and people executing

[12/04/2020 2:19 PM] morphic#4133
@kushti sigmastate is internal library. I would discourage its uncontrolled usage by community because it doesn't have well defined public interface. A lot of internal details is publicly available which, if used externally, may limit our ability to evolve it. If one need to use sign transactions from JVM, Appkit can be used, in which public interface is limited and fully documented.


[12/04/2020 2:33 PM] kushti#0978
@morphic but I guess you're looking for contributors ?


[12/04/2020 2:43 PM] morphic#4133
@kushti yes, will write some repo description there, but sigma is not for dApp developers. 
From this perspective Sigmaverse name may create undesirable association with sigmastate repository.


[12/04/2020 2:47 PM] Robert K#0722
I think if you simply clearly specify in the readme that is an internal lib and not for dApp devs it'll be fine.


[12/04/2020 2:48 PM] Robert K#0722
And tbh, i don't think anyone is going to be actively searching to make their lives harder and try to use lower level tools when it's hard enough for people to get in as it is.


[12/04/2020 2:49 PM] Robert K#0722
So if there's no educational material i don't think we have to worry too much it'll be used in the near future


[12/04/2020 5:00 PM] Robert K#0722
@kushti So let's work on setting a date for the Ergo Summit/Hard Fork? Even if it's questionable when the HF will be ready, we could aim it a bit later in January.


[12/04/2020 5:01 PM] Robert K#0722
Maybe Saturday January 23rd for the Ergo Summit, and Monday February 1st for the HF?


[12/04/2020 5:02 PM] Robert K#0722
That should be sufficient time to 100% have the HF prepared (I imagine since you originally estimated mid-January), and so if we can set a hard date we can start to announce/advertise the Ergo Summit in a week or two to get people excited.


[12/04/2020 5:04 PM] Robert K#0722
I guess also we don't have to announce the HF date until the Ergo Summit, so we have a lot of flexibility there.


[12/04/2020 5:05 PM] Robert K#0722
We can even get people excited by saying publicly before hand that we'll announce the HF date during the Ergo Summit.


[12/04/2020 6:43 PM] kushti#0978
@Robert K activation date must be set in software few weeks ago the fork

@kushti @Robert K there is something to discuss before setting the HF date in stone https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/issues/1250
I think this should be done as part of v4.0 HF to allow scaling number of tx per block.

[12/07/2020 10:19 AM] morphic#4133
Once JIT costing is done, we will be able to 10x increase MaxBlockCost, which will allow (according to the current approach) existence of very costly transactions in the chain, which is exactly the problem described in "Demystifying Incentives in the Consensus Computer" paper.


[12/07/2020 10:20 AM] Robert K#0722
So with JIT we're still going to be assigning a cost for txs that fail?


[12/07/2020 10:21 AM] morphic#4133
Yes, but in a more granular fashion


[12/07/2020 10:21 AM] Robert K#0722
I thought that was decided on not being the case because it would require a user always provides an input they own


[12/07/2020 10:21 AM] morphic#4133
using MaxTxCost


[12/07/2020 10:21 AM] Robert K#0722
And so it would break the mixer and other use cases potentially


[12/07/2020 10:22 AM] Robert K#0722
Or am I understanding wrong?


[12/07/2020 10:22 AM] morphic#4133

[12/07/2020 10:23 AM] morphic#4133
This part was added after the initial EIP proposal, and it seems was never discussed.


[12/07/2020 10:24 AM] morphic#4133
However I think it is important


[12/07/2020 10:27 AM] morphic#4133
No breaking changes. It only adds additional limit on the transaction


[12/07/2020 10:27 AM] Robert K#0722
Right, so rather than just complexity limits, we have extra cost parameter limits as well?


[12/07/2020 10:27 AM] Robert K#0722
Or would they replace complexity limits?


[12/07/2020 10:28 AM] Robert K#0722
(I don't know very much about how this works currently so I'm a bit naive here)


[12/07/2020 10:29 AM] morphic#4133
Currently we have single limit on the whole block (MaxBlockCost), so a block can have one big transaction up to this limit.


[12/07/2020 10:30 AM] morphic#4133
If we grow MaxBlockCost like 10x then we will have a situation when one tx may cost like the 1000 of others.


[12/07/2020 10:32 AM] morphic#4133
MaxTransactionCost will limit this to something more secure.


[12/07/2020 10:33 AM] morphic#4133
We can define this MaxTransactionCost parameter conservatively and then increase via voting if necessary


[12/07/2020 10:35 AM] mhs_sam#1471
what's the problem with one huge tx that pay its fee?


[12/07/2020 10:36 AM] morphic#4133
The fees can be small, because we are not bounding fees with the cost


[12/07/2020 10:37 AM] morphic#4133
and the miner has no way of knowing the cost in advance


[12/07/2020 10:38 AM] mhs_sam#1471
the fee can be small, it's miner's choice to include or exclude


[12/07/2020 10:38 AM] morphic#4133
but how to decide?


[12/07/2020 10:38 AM] morphic#4133
small fee doesn't mean the cost will be small,


[12/07/2020 10:39 AM] mhs_sam#1471
oh, got it. so why changing the fee limits rather than giving the ability to miners to decide


[12/07/2020 10:39 AM] morphic#4133
and the miner will spend time executing the tx, just to know it is very costly.


[12/07/2020 10:40 AM] morphic#4133
so the attack is to craft a benign looking tx with small fees, which in reality is very costly up to MaxBlockCost limit


[12/07/2020 10:41 AM] morphic#4133
the miner will loose 2-5 seconds and will delay new block mining


[12/07/2020 10:42 AM] morphic#4133
this creates an incentive to bypass verification and just start mining


[12/07/2020 10:43 AM] morphic#4133
MaxTxCost will be at least 10x less than MaxBlockCost, so the incentive to bypass validation will be reduced


[12/07/2020 10:45 AM] mhs_sam#1471
thanks, got it. btw, i should read the ADT and JIT in detail. just another question: what if miners vote to increase the MaxTxCost to be equal to MaxBlockCost over time?


[12/07/2020 10:46 AM] Robert K#0722
@morphic I think this sounds like a decent solution that I'd be in favour of.


[12/07/2020 10:49 AM] Robert K#0722
I guess allowing that to be the case could be considered a good thing? If for whatever reason people want to turn MaxTxCost "off", then that's what they would vote for.


[12/07/2020 10:50 AM] morphic#4133
It will require @kushti to review existing verification logic, which I also not fully know of.


[12/07/2020 10:50 AM] mhs_sam#1471
I was thinking it would be okay since the tx will pay its real fee btw


[12/07/2020 10:52 AM] morphic#4133
I think we should also limit increase and to strictly require MaxTxCost * 10 < MaxBlockCost. So at some point in order to increase it you also need to increase MaxBlockCost.


[12/07/2020 10:54 AM] morphic#4133
But I'm not sure the current implementation of voting allows such constrants between parameters.


[12/07/2020 11:01 AM] Robert K#0722
I imagine MaxBlockCost could just be fixed then?


[12/07/2020 11:02 AM] morphic#4133
no, in contrast to ETH we will not have gas-like fees.


[12/07/2020 11:02 AM] Robert K#0722
`MaxBlockCost = MaxTxCost * 10`


[12/07/2020 11:02 AM] Robert K#0722
If you want to have a strict 10x relation always (as something that we can do if the voting doesn't allow otherwise)


[12/07/2020 11:02 AM] mhs_sam#1471
could be > instead of =


[12/07/2020 11:04 AM] morphic#4133
I'm not sure how strict it should be. In the paper they call such ratio parameter `epsilon` and hence `epsilon consensus`.


[12/07/2020 11:04 AM] morphic#4133
So, I would make it flexible, just in case.


[12/07/2020 11:05 AM] mhs_sam#1471
btw, as of Now, I do not see any problem with any MaxTxCost as long as the miner can calculate the cost and can decide to include it or not. Besides, i guess forcing a mutual limit could be hard


[12/07/2020 12:03 PM] morphic#4133
when you say "miner can calculate the cost" what do you mean?

as far as my understanding, in ADT miner estimates the cost but in JIT really evaluates it at time of execution, so I said the miner calculates the cost and so there might be no restriction for the cost up to the MaxBlockCost


[12/07/2020 12:43 PM] morphic#4133
yes, if we don't introduce MaxTxCost limit, then JIT may execute the contract up until MaxBlockCost is accumulated, which on average approximates the total time budget for block verification.


[12/07/2020 12:53 PM] morphic#4133
This will all make much more sense when we will have 1000 of tx per block (which is roughly 8 tx/sec). Imagine the miner have a pool of 1000 tx all with pretty much similar fees. The miner thus expects to fit them all in a block. He take the first from the pool, spend 2 seconds and learns it exceeds MaxBlockCost, throw it away, takes the second tx, spends another 2 sec and learns it is also overcosted, takes third tx, etc.  This way 60 txs will already be enough to spend 2 min time, and there is still more than 900 in the pool left and the miner still don't have block candidate.


[12/07/2020 1:01 PM] mhs_sam#1471
I see, and could you describe how JIT will help?


[12/07/2020 1:07 PM] kushti#0978
No, like now tx will be whether accepted or rejected.


[12/07/2020 1:12 PM] kushti#0978
1) not sure this channel is for tech discussions
2) MaxTransactionCost should be a client-side setting I guess, not part of a verification protocol


[12/07/2020 1:15 PM] kushti#0978
So miner can set MaxTransactionCost to avoid attacks mentioned, but this is an individual setting


[12/07/2020 1:15 PM] kushti#0978
So during verification every transaction which is in block limit is okay


[12/07/2020 1:16 PM] kushti#0978
We already have similar client-side setting maxComplexity


[12/07/2020 1:20 PM] kushti#0978
For the verification protocol, no any sense in limiting transaction cost.


[12/07/2020 1:20 PM] kushti#0978
And so #1250 can be done at any moment after (or before) 4.0


[12/07/2020 2:23 PM] morphic#4133
The attack I described can be done by miner. If we allow complex transactions, then any miner will be able to take advantage of it over other miners by submitting such transactions, which will require other miners to spend a lot of time, while the attacker can avoid verification at all.


[12/07/2020 2:35 PM] kushti#0978
@morphic so then other miners should set a stricter maxTxCost limit


[12/07/2020 2:36 PM] morphic#4133
if this limit is used for verification of mined blocks, then it is part of the protocol.


[12/07/2020 2:37 PM] kushti#0978
@morphic for verification, only block limit matters


[12/07/2020 2:38 PM] kushti#0978
Why should you care how this limit is split among transactions ?


[12/07/2020 2:58 PM] morphic#4133
huge transactions create asymmetry between author and the rest of the network. Since we don't connect the actual resources which are required for verification to the tx fees, an adversary (one of the mining pools, which are coming hopefully) can design a schema where he can force the whole network to spend a lot of computational resources basically for free, thus taking advantage in a long run. Once this strategy is discovered, we will have an instance of verifier's dilemma, and some pools may opt to randomly try to avoid verification of even design some more complex strategies. 
Any such advantage creates incentive for attack, which will be exploited sooner or later. And I think we can an should prevent this advantage in a first place.


[12/07/2020 3:05 PM] kushti#0978
@morphic yes, mempool improvements are needed, see https://www.ergoforum.org/t/protecting-mempool-from-computationally-heavy-transactions/231

But for now, let's confirm that we're on the same page? What are you describing is not a part of the verification (consensus) protocol, right?

Protecting mempool from computationally heavy transactions
In regards with a switch from AOT to JIT costing being discussed recently, a lot of talks on how to protect from computationally heavy (and possibly adversarial) transaction is going on.  In the first place, block validation (consensus-critical verification protocol) works in the same way regardless a costing procedure, if the procedure ensures ...


[12/07/2020 3:20 PM] morphic#4133
My point is that this statement of the post "...then there are no critical spam issues on this level..." about current protocol schema with single MaxBlockCost parameter is wrong. 
So my previous message describes why is think the current protocol will create attack incentive once JIT will allow to scale tx above 1000 per block (which is 100x with the current average)
Adopting Bitcoin by analogy is misleading IMO since we need to deal with complex and potentially costly contracts, where as bitcoin is not, so we cannot just copy their design and sleep well.


[12/07/2020 3:46 PM] kushti#0978
@morphic alright, then you need to describe an attack on the protocol level, which can be prevented with MaxTxCost


[12/07/2020 3:47 PM] kushti#0978
Your attack on miners is about mempools


[12/07/2020 3:53 PM] morphic#4133
What happens if I create a new block candidate and send it to the network?


[12/07/2020 3:55 PM] kushti#0978
emmm


[12/07/2020 3:55 PM] kushti#0978
what do you mean ?


[12/07/2020 3:56 PM] morphic#4133
Can I do it, or I need to mine the block first and can send only mined block?


[12/07/2020 3:56 PM] kushti#0978
Surely the latter only


[12/07/2020 4:02 PM] morphic#4133
ok, then what happens when the node receives such mined block? The node should accept it, to build maximal chain and start mining on top of it. 
In order to accept, the node should verify (then it will spend resources) or the node can accept without verification and start mining on top of potentially invalid block. All of this is part of the protocol?


[12/07/2020 4:04 PM] kushti#0978
Node should do verification of the block (protocol is trying to enforce it, but so-called SPV mining still possible to some degree maybe)


[12/07/2020 4:04 PM] kushti#0978
Or maybe not


[12/07/2020 4:05 PM] morphic#4133
We cannot enforce verification if there is incentive not to do that in a long run.


[12/07/2020 4:06 PM] morphic#4133
Thus the node need to decide, verify or not


[12/07/2020 4:06 PM] Robert K#0722
But if the verification is ignored by a given % of nodes, their chain that they build will be considered invalid by nodes/the protocol


[12/07/2020 4:07 PM] Robert K#0722
Those who mine on top of valid txs will end up being the true history.


[12/07/2020 4:07 PM] Robert K#0722
I guess you could end up with a fork of miners who just do SPV mining (or I guess the new up and coming NiPoPoW log-space mining without verifying)


[12/07/2020 4:11 PM] Robert K#0722
I imagine that would be a sufficient disincentive, where if you don't verify then the mining you do on top will have a chance of going to waste and you earn 0 Ergs in reality.


[12/07/2020 4:15 PM] kushti#0978
to get rewards, the node is needed to update the state tree
For that, verification is needed (at least, tree modification)


[12/07/2020 4:15 PM] kushti#0978
Ergo is better than Bitcoin then in regards with tacking with SPV mining


[12/07/2020 4:16 PM] morphic#4133
I'm not sure that there is stable strategy in the network when some miners don't do verification, but if such skipping is incentivised, then some miners may try to do this.
Actually this is much better described in the paper, and they refer to some precedents in ethereum.


[12/07/2020 4:16 PM] kushti#0978
@morphic how's SPV mining is related to MaxTxCost then ?


[12/07/2020 4:17 PM] kushti#0978
I'm lost at this point


[12/07/2020 4:17 PM] kushti#0978
on SPV mining, it was done by some pools in Ethereum during spam attacks in 2016, also there were incindends in Bitcoin about that


[12/07/2020 4:18 PM] kushti#0978
there were some proposals (e.g. by SDL), they're not fully preventing SPV mining in theory though


[12/07/2020 4:18 PM] kushti#0978
but again, that's different topic


[12/07/2020 4:19 PM] morphic#4133
it allows to prevent if, I'm refering the paper, where it is explained in details. More accurately, not to prevent but disincentivize


[12/07/2020 4:20 PM] kushti#0978
@morphic how?


[12/07/2020 4:51 PM] morphic#4133
by introducing MaxTxCost in addition to MaxBlockCost.


[12/07/2020 4:53 PM] morphic#4133
They prove theorem that the incentive to bypass validation is reduced proportionally to the ratio between this parameters, so can be reduced as low as necessary.


[12/07/2020 4:54 PM] morphic#4133
They also show that it doesn't limit the programability because any complex transaction can be split into a series of smallet sub-transactions.


[12/07/2020 4:56 PM] morphic#4133
All this can be nicely applied to Ergo, since we may have very complex scripts as well


[12/08/2020 8:02 AM] kushti#0978
@morphic can you cite the paper please? On the need of MaxTxCost

Reminder: we need to decide how to run TN / PolarityExchange gateways:

from mortimer :
"ok, you guys are pretty much all anon right?
normally we need someone from the ERGO team to run the gateway, and do the application for the ticker and the gateway. That's just to make sure that no bad player can create a proxy token for someone else.
If you want me to do it, i would need to get some sort of position within the ERGO team.
But let me discuss it internally with the rest of the core team and see what's the easiest way to do this.
mortimer11/25/2020
ok, first thing you (or someone from ERGO) will need to do is fill out this form: https://www.turtlenetwork.eu/turtle-network-ticker-assignment/ - all the information you want to keep private, you can keep private.
Turtle Network

FYI: Eva has done a 17 page doc on Ergo in Chinese. Going to review and provide comments. Guess go out within a week but need to schedule with the marketing company. Also, the final version that actually goes out will be significantly cut down in size but the rest of the materials should still be useful for 1) posting somewhere in entirety; 2) Eva mentions making a wiki of sorts using this as base; 3) serves purpose of getting her really familiar with Ergo up front.

but he has some family issues it seems


[12/09/2020 6:52 AM] kushti#0978

[12/09/2020 6:52 AM] kushti#0978
to work with


[12/09/2020 6:53 AM] mx#5165
in this case i think it should be grant for Mortimer, foundation has already treasury in control


[12/09/2020 6:56 AM] mx#5165
such gateway is still part of their exchange, if there is need he can be foundation member also i guess for whatever reason

[12/09/2020 7:01 AM] kushti#0978
On reworking marketing machine

[12/09/2020 7:14 AM] kushti#0978
@morphic checked the paper, Lemma 1 is quite weird. It is concluding with :
"Thus, the work required in verifying all transactions in a block is no greater than ŒµWblk.  By Definition 3, this an incentive-compatible strategy for Œµ-rational miners." 

However, given  Œµ and Wblk, you can limit work required in verifying all transactions in a block with no per-transaction limit, just by setting per-block limit to  ŒµWblk , getting the same result.

Also, per-Tx limit can be done via SF after 4,0, old clients will accept new blocks. But again, I see no any need for that.


[12/09/2020 7:15 AM] kushti#0978
Let's set HF date to Feb 1st ?

[12/09/2020 7:18 AM] mx#5165
@kushti i guess marketing coordinators should be new people like Sakata and his friends he can bring eventually, Ergo101 etc, Sordum promoting on reddit is ok, Cassius is ok, so they could basically create article for review and distribution by outlets, twitter is weak spot because it is being considered a task job by man doing the same for dozens, similar with deisgners from Carlos but still lack of coordinator is top problem now


[12/09/2020 7:19 AM] kushti#0978

[12/09/2020 8:29 AM] morphic#4133
The paper have different terminology from what we use, definitely, but however the lemma may look weird it still holds, so the question is how to interpret it and apply to our case.


[12/09/2020 8:30 AM] morphic#4133
@kushti Yes, we probably can introduce this MaxTxCost limit later as part of v5.0. However "old clients will accept new blocks" also means the old clients may be attacked with big transactions which they will pick up into blocks, mine them and get rejected by the network. 
Is it ok?


[12/09/2020 8:31 AM] morphic#4133
This doesn't sound like soft fork, at least it may be not so soft for v4.0 miners under attack.


[12/09/2020 8:34 AM] kushti#0978
@morphic still , I do not understand the attack you're talking about. Can you explain it as a scenario ?


[12/09/2020 8:34 AM] kushti#0978
Do you know what SF is ?


[12/09/2020 8:35 AM] kushti#0978
How's is it activated I mean


[12/09/2020 8:40 AM] morphic#4133
I believe it means the old clients can continue be part of consensus and update the chain head with the rest of the network. 
I'm not sure about nuances of the terminology though. 
If the old client can sometimes produce invalid blocks (rejected by the network) does it still count as soft-fork?


[12/09/2020 8:42 AM] kushti#0978
SF activated by 90+% miners support


[12/09/2020 8:42 AM] kushti#0978
So 90+% miners will be on 5.0


[12/09/2020 8:43 AM] kushti#0978
Back to the attack, what is this about? So you need to describe a scenario which can be prevented with MaxTxCost


[12/09/2020 8:43 AM] kushti#0978
I can't find any


[12/09/2020 9:00 AM] Robert K#0722
Maybe can we move this MaxTxCost discussion to another contributor channel?


[12/09/2020 9:00 AM] morphic#4133
My point is that because of the rich scripts Ergo is subject to verifier's dilemma described and analysed in the paper. To prevent it we can apply the solution proposed in the paper (adapted to our terminology). This is described in their abstract. 
ABSTRACT
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and the more recent Ethereum system allow users to specify scripts in transactions and con- tracts to support applications beyond simple cash transac- tions. In this work, we analyze the extent to which these systems can enforce the correct semantics of scripts. We show that when a script execution requires nontrivial com- putation effort, practical attacks exist which either waste miners‚Äô computational resources or lead miners to accept incorrect script results. These attacks drive miners to an ill- fated choice, which we call the verifier‚Äôs dilemma, whereby rational miners are well-incentivized to accept unvalidated blockchains. We call the framework of computation through a scriptable cryptocurrency a consensus computer and de- velop a model that captures incentives for verifying com- putation in it. We propose a resolution to the verifier‚Äôs dilemma which incentivizes correct execution of certain ap- plications, including outsourced computation, where scripts require minimal time to verify. Finally we discuss two dis- tinct, practical implementations of our consensus computer in real cryptocurrency networks like Ethereum.

[12/09/2020 9:01 AM] Robert K#0722

@morphic every cryptocurrency is


[12/09/2020 9:06 AM] morphic#4133
so you don't believe that it may lead to real attacks?


[12/09/2020 9:07 AM] kushti#0978
@morphic security is not about beliefs. On attacks, I've provided real examples already yesterday.


[12/09/2020 9:08 AM] kushti#0978
So yes, the issue is real and we're following best practices from around


[12/09/2020 9:08 AM] morphic#4133
no, we are not


[12/09/2020 9:12 AM] morphic#4133
anyway, I'm quite sure we need to add MaxTxCost parameter either in v4.0 or v5.0. I don't think we need to argue anymore about this.  
@kushti, since you are doing the final v4.0 release it is up to you to decide on whether to include MaxTxCost in it or not. Also time to market should be considered among other points.


[12/09/2020 9:14 AM] kushti#0978
@morphic alright, I'm waiting for description of attacks vector which can be prevented by MaxTxCost but not MaxBlockCost just, in private development. Without that, there's nothing to discuss really.


[12/09/2020 9:18 AM] Robert K#0722
Hmm, so the most useful part of using the HDF is that if we write an informal spec it'll be easier to translate into off-chain code using the HDF. Since the gateways are intended to be run on servers and not really be interacted with directly by users, the benefits are slightly diminished over most user-facing dApps.

I think for the server-side off-chain code that the oracles themselves use, there's not much benefit for using the HDF. But for the user-facing code for them to submit txs with their Ergs/tokens to Gravity oracles, it could be useful to write that as a headles dApp using the HDF so it's portable and easily reusable.


[12/09/2020 9:21 AM] kushti#0978
@Robert K maybe we can have headless dapp stub for multi-signing then ?


[12/09/2020 9:21 AM] kushti#0978
And it can be re-used in different contexts


[12/09/2020 9:28 AM] Robert K#0722
Ah, great idea.


[12/09/2020 10:15 AM] mhs_sam#1471
does it make sense to add another field to the rich list, like "known as", and tag the addresses with the relative owner? there could be some certainity status as well


[12/09/2020 10:46 AM] kushti#0978
@mhs_sam to mark exchanges ?


[12/09/2020 10:48 AM] mhs_sam#1471
yes even more. Some addresses will be known to be owned by some big players over time. e.g. if you got Roger Ver to invest, he might have a big holding. so hinting people on this relation would be interesting


[12/09/2020 10:48 AM] kushti#0978
but also speculative


[12/09/2020 10:49 AM] kushti#0978
also, motivating to use the mixer


[12/09/2020 10:49 AM] mhs_sam#1471
also, in the future some collaterals or contracts could be in richlist


[12/09/2020 10:49 AM] mhs_sam#1471
sure


[12/09/2020 10:49 AM] kushti#0978
but we already promoting mixer on the rich-list page


[12/09/2020 10:50 AM] mhs_sam#1471
mixer is for users to avoid this, but exchanges will not use it for example. so it is motivating mixer and is not in contract with ergo features btw


[12/09/2020 10:51 AM] kushti#0978
stablecoin contract will be there hopefully yes

@morphic for handling 1000 txs in a block on consensus computer, please note that verifier dilemma paper is using simplified model where block is fully validated on arrival. there are many proposals to have transactions mostly validated when a block got mined (see Bitcoin mempool, Graphene paper, Compact Blocks proposal,  https://www.ergoforum.org/t/protecting-mempool-from-computationally-heavy-transactions/231 etc).

I think to work on such things along with improved bootstrapping in 2021. Wallet /scans  API is more or less good now. Hopefuully we can get contributors for nipopow clients and utxo snapshot bootstrapping in 2021.

What are your plans for 2021 ?

In regards with a switch from AOT to JIT costing being discussed recently, a lot of talks on how to protect from computationally heavy (and possibly adversarial) transaction is going on.  In the first place, block validation (consensus-critical verification protocol) works in the same way regardless a costing procedure, if the procedure ensures ...

[12/10/2020 10:14 AM] morphic#4133
@kushti My plans for 2021 are mostly around v5.0:
1) finish new interpreter for v5.0 
2) extend testing harness to support cross-version test cases (this is a major time sink so far, but I don't know other way to guarantee backward compatibility of new releases while significant changes and refactoring has to be done)
3) get rid of old AOT costing code and other simplifications of sigma codebase
4) stop developing new features and switch to maintenance only mode
5) switch to working on something new

I'm fine with accepting this grant as long as we have someone who is physically able to take care of them/shipping them out.


[12/10/2020 9:28 PM] mhs_sam#1471
it is $40K actually


[12/10/2020 9:45 PM] mhs_sam#1471
have you ever considered coolwallet?
btw, I think such a price ($40k) is very high for integration. However it will be reasonable if the wallets can be sold later.

I think ledger and trezor, even the ledger alone, is sufficient right now, unless there is a good proposal for a less known HW.
instead we can pay money to be integrated with some well-known mobile wallets, like coinomi, **atomic**, **trust**, exodus, jaxx, since lots of people can used them.

Oh...didn't know we were talking to BC Vault. I met their COO again in early November and he seemed quite keen on integrating Ergo. 300 units/US$40k sounds way too much for us. In theory if you have someone to handle it all could be resold but I think would take long time as BC Vault not as popular as Ledger by far and would be huge hassle. Maybe 100 units. Or are we just back stopping 300 unit sale so people can just buy direct from BCVault over a certain time period but we need to pick up for short fall <300 units? That would be much better but still too much and I think would take long time for us to find the buyers. If that is the case 100 units would probably be fine as probably would get the money back within 6-12 months...


[12/11/2020 3:24 AM] Justin1000#9555
Agree Ledger should be top priority by far. Since Jason Davies is not delivering seems should just find someone reliable and give a new grant and get it done ASAP. Can't the Magnum guys do it?

I am just doing what we discussed.
1. Responding to all Eva's questions assisting her in writing the 20,000 character Chinese "article" (more like the basis for something bigger and a comprehensive non-technical intro to Ergo)
2. Reviewed the article...going to provide the comments today. 
3. It will be cut down and sent out by Eva after changes made. I told her do as soon as possible but I leave exact timing to her. Not as urgent as originally because pushed back fork and stuff. But hope goes out in ~7 days.
Coordination: not concerned about this at this exact moment. We are starting from zero in China so just need to get Eva up to speed, get the intro out there and start getting things warmed up. But yes, soon should see if Eva can get into the Ergonauts group/etc as will need to have closer coordination in new year.
Saw should ask York about mining materials/marketing etc in Chinese. Will check in with them when we send out the article. 
Lastly, we may need to give the translation role to Eva as well. Get the impression from her to justify full time she wants to do that too and get paid more. But we should defer any decision on this until end of month to see how she is working out. But seems good so far!
Regarding call, maybe we should resume our bi-weekly chat next week? @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ is back from the Kung Fu monastery...

Wallet integrations/exchanges haven't really done anything for us, and I don't see why they would, as we don't have a good way to genuinely on-board people so they understand the value of Ergo and devs understand how they can build on top

Exchanges are bringing users. HW wallets are needed for holding. But focus should be on bringing users (doing promotion) and devs (getting people with tech skills excited about Ergo vision and possibilities)


[12/11/2020 12:07 PM] Robert K#0722
But have exchanges really brought many users? Gate.io seems that even though it's a big exchange no one uses it and idk if we gained a single user from it.


[12/11/2020 12:07 PM] Robert K#0722
I think partnerships + events are the best way to get users.


[12/11/2020 12:08 PM] Robert K#0722
And then good quality tutorials so people can use dApps will help them stay


[12/11/2020 12:08 PM] Robert K#0722
And good quality educational material for devs will get them building


[12/11/2020 12:10 PM] mx#5165
looks like exchanges running own market makers only brought users so far


[12/11/2020 6:37 PM] mhs_sam#1471
I think now the only required exchange is binance. other exchanges are enough and adding more medium size exchange has no benefits. 
btw, at list one well-known wallet is necessary, atomic and trust are the tops right now.
also, ledger itself can be enough at HW level.
So, I suggest ledger/atomic or trust/binance. anything more than them could be at no or very low price


[12/11/2020 7:54 PM] kushti#0978

[12/11/2020 8:18 PM] mhs_sam#1471
I don't know, nicehash has a fixed list, maybe some others have more flexibility


[12/11/2020 8:19 PM] mhs_sam#1471

Guarda : 1.5 BTC + 1.5 BTC in erg


[12/12/2020 3:16 AM] Justin1000#9555
No Gate.io didn't help at all but they also did ZERO promotion and we're still pre-fork with miner centralization and bad order books. So agree with all that and Binance being far and above more important than other exchanges but still think listing on some more could be good. Need to only prioritize the ones that are going to do marketing and AMAs etc. Of the ones above Bitcoin.com seems most interesting. But I doubt need to bother with time and expense of Changelly, Coinomi, Gaurda, ZBX etc right now. Besides exchanges that could be partners/marketing then only other targets top ~15 exchanges (like HiTBTC) + always Binance #1 priority.


[12/12/2020 3:21 AM] Justin1000#9555
Would also REALLY like to get Ledger started. 2 BTC is a lot for us though given price of ERGs right now. Like 60% of one months rewards to the Foundation. So tough call on whether should pay for that right now. I am on the fence but the community has asked for it over and over again.


[12/12/2020 3:24 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah agree with Robert getting more devs probably top priority as they will lead to more apps and users (besides miners which we need even more pre-fork) . my big concern is that we are just so resource-constrained because of the low Erg price but anything that can be done on a low budget would be good to prioritize probably over some of these exchanges


[12/12/2020 3:27 AM] Justin1000#9555
hopefully the price goes up post the fork...if it just gets to like ~$2 probably enough for some real dev on-boarding / grants etc.


[12/12/2020 4:56 AM] Justin1000#9555
Probably ledger is too expensive for us right now at 2 BTC with current Erg price. Should save as many foundation ergs for later when price higher


[12/12/2020 8:05 PM] kushti#0978
Coinomi: 2 BTC or 3 BTC in erg


[12/12/2020 8:20 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 on pricing, currently it is not just about the newly minted ergs, some miners are selling ergs mined from July'19 till Feb'20 (and then sent from mining addresses to ordinary ones in April-May). In some days there're like 100+K erg withdrawals (in total from all the exchanges), so like 2x daily issuance, but pressure is still the same.


[12/12/2020 8:22 PM] kushti#0978
Good thing is, even under such double-pressure price is staying around 2K sats


[12/12/2020 8:36 PM] kushti#0978
Well, I have better channels for HitBTC / Changelly / Bitcoin.com, lemme try them

@Robert K so let's announce a grant for headless dapp on distributed signing?


[12/18/2020 8:33 PM] kushti#0978
I think this is a low-hanging fruit for Ergo


[12/18/2020 8:34 PM] Robert K#0722
But is there anyone who can do that?


[12/18/2020 8:34 PM] kushti#0978
Oh, likely Ergo Node Interface is needed


[12/18/2020 8:34 PM] Robert K#0722
Idk if we have enough of a community to just announce grants for specific things


[12/18/2020 8:34 PM] kushti#0978
Why not?


[12/18/2020 8:34 PM] kushti#0978
On devs, Gravity has some candidates atm


[12/18/2020 8:35 PM] kushti#0978
I found some devs around Twitter followers (some joined recently)


[12/18/2020 8:36 PM] kushti#0978
So we can talk and find 2-3 new devs maybe (including Gravity's) to teach


[12/18/2020 8:39 PM] Robert K#0722
Oh really? That's awesome to hear


[12/18/2020 8:39 PM] Robert K#0722

I assumed we had 0 candidates


[12/18/2020 8:39 PM] Robert K#0722
So announcing more grants wouldn't make a difference

[12/21/2020 12:52 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
This is a WeChat ("weixin") article actually, but  has the qq in the address since both WeChat and qq are owned by the same company, Tencent. WeChat is by far the most popular social media app in China.

Hey @morphic#4133 . We didn't think of this till eva just mentioned it but @morphic used to be at Huawei research lab. 6 plus years! We might be able to use that for china marketing. Maybe @morphic can do some amas or something üòÉ

@morphic any ETA towards 5.0 ? Let's create joint core dev plan for 2021


[12/30/2020 10:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
Update from me:
-Been out of quarantine in China for 1.5 weeks now. In Shenzhen. Been talking to people and pushing Ergo.
-Went to 2 conferences Eva got me invited to (@noah went to one as well). One was the Deep Chain year-end awards. DeepChain is apparently the biggest crypto media in China or near to it. They can help  market. They take the token of the project so incentivizes are aligned and then go all out. Proabably is pretty good. But I'm afraid too costly for us. But I asked Eva to have some informal talks with them to see the kind of terms might be needed.
-Went to a mining conference and made some mining contacts. Having some ongoing dialogue. One guy in particular is Grin miner and mining ETC. He seems quite keen on Ergo. Claims to know Huobi well. Also there is guy based in Nanjing with a 300 person investment club. can arrange big meetup there when @kushti comes back to China next year. 
-Havin a talk with WBF tomorrow. Some 2nd tier exchange. They said could help market. They know we don't want to pay for listings. Will hear what they have to say...
-Gonna find some more conferences. Also I been talking in our wechats more. Activity still low but picking up.


[12/30/2020 10:12 AM] Justin1000#9555
REGARDING EVA: Coming to month-end. @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ might be able to provide some more details but the pick up in wechat members wasn't so great. But the problem was with the media group we used. They weren't near as productive as the one we originally used 1.5 years ago (apparently that guy doesn't do it anymore though). So nothing to do with Eva. And we did get some results. Also for the tiny amount we payed, I think we can expect it to be hit or miss. Eva is doing research and going to come up with some alternative proposals and partners to try.


[12/30/2020 10:14 AM] Justin1000#9555
I strongly recommend getting Eva on full time. She is really enthusiastic, logical and seems hard working. And good to have a Chinese face. And she helps me and @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ be more productive for sure. Gets us invited to conferences, digs through the Chinese stuff and does due diligence etc. She could do more on chat stimulation but that should be easy. Also, we can always get rid of her if not working out for some reason although I'm pretty optimistic she will be great addition. But she is not a volunteer type so need to pay her.


[12/30/2020 10:17 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ can speak to her and see how much she needs for full-time. I think she should do all the China community management, be key China marketing person AND do all the translation. So one person for all this. I hope she will do it for $1500 a month. And just pay Erg equivalent every month. Its a relevant amount for us but it isn't that much really. Problem is Erg price is still so low! but anyway i still recommend doing it. So this would mean we could cut Gary out if she takes over all translation. I haven't been bothering to get him to do much translation lately anyway. So that is 750 Erg savings right there. But lets see what Eva needs first...guess @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ can revert.

Pretty huge Endorsement by Charles saying he only owns 3 coins: Ergo, Bitcoin and ADA. Can't believe Ergo's market cap is 1/500th of ADA. This industry is full of idiots I guess. Hope the hard fork and more marketing etc changes things. Need real use cases too! Things people can use Ergo for today!

Good to hear you're making strides in China.


[12/30/2020 10:52 AM] Robert K#0722
We need more marketing desperately, and with the upcoming HF this is probably a key moment to throw resources everywhere that we can to try and get some momentum, so I'd be happy to vote for putting Eva full-time (for at least the next 3-4 months and then asses the cost/benefit ratio)


[12/30/2020 1:35 PM] morphic#4133
I agree to have Eva full time.


[12/30/2020 1:39 PM] kushti#0978
"Maybe that's something the EF should do for the Ergo Summit as well? Create an ambassador program (just 1 page on ergoplatform.org with an email for people to submit their applications to) where we fund people on a monthly basis to represent Ergo/create videos/write articles/...
And we can announce the program at the Ergo Summit, so this really feels like a new era
Im 99% sure something like the above will be 100x better use of Ergs than getting another random exchange tbh"

[12/30/2020 1:39 PM] kushti#0978
let's discuss


[12/30/2020 1:41 PM] mhs_sam#1471
I'm also agree with this view and will vote for that.


[12/30/2020 1:42 PM] mhs_sam#1471
seems a good strategy


[12/30/2020 4:17 PM] mx#5165
nice idea, ambassadors from different countries would be great


[12/30/2020 7:53 PM] Robert K#0722
One point to add, though I suggested the idea I don't think I'll have enough spare time in 2021 to actually take responsibility for managing the program


[12/30/2020 7:53 PM] Robert K#0722
So if we want to push for it we need to clearly define responsibilities of who does what


[01/05/2021 1:30 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Eva has requested US$2,000 per month to be full time for Ergo as community manager and translator.


[01/05/2021 1:31 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
In this capacity, she would include translations not only of blog posts but relevant Tweets and other content that would be useful for China community, and some past translation work that should be re-done (for example the whitepaper, which was not done by Gary but by a translator I found on the internet who did a lousy job and seems to have just used Google translate but I failed to notice at the time).


[01/05/2021 1:31 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Acceptable?


[01/05/2021 5:54 AM] Justin1000#9555
Was hoping for lower but I think it is acceptable. We are going into a crucial period so need someone for China. And she is the only one familiar and ready to go. Moreover she does seem good and hard working. Lastly we can always get rid of her in a few months if not working out for some reason or we find the cost too much.


[01/05/2021 6:40 AM] mx#5165
in long term sounds reasonable, for next months i would propose +50% increase in ERG


[01/05/2021 10:31 AM] Robert K#0722
I generally agree with this perspective


[01/05/2021 10:31 AM] Robert K#0722
It'd be better if it was a bit less, but the next 2-3 months are kind of crucial


[01/05/2021 10:31 AM] Robert K#0722
So ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[01/05/2021 1:34 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah we will give her lots of work üòÄ    she does seem really solid tho. 2 years experience already in crypto for cardano. She worked hard on the 17 page article getting familiar with ergo from scratch. and has been following up aggressively on things.


[01/05/2021 2:08 PM] kushti#0978
What are results to the moment though?


[01/05/2021 2:08 PM] kushti#0978
Guys, it seems we have clearly execution problem


[01/05/2021 2:19 PM] Justin1000#9555
Thought @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ was going to summarize the results to-date to tie it off. Not much results. But as I mentioned before we didn't get much results from that media channel we used this time. Although they were cheap so hit or miss anyway.


[01/05/2021 2:19 PM] Justin1000#9555
Deep Chain said today they want 180k ergs...around USD 70k to cooperate.  I had eva talk to them.


[01/05/2021 2:20 PM] Justin1000#9555
There are a few others that contacted me. I met them at conferences. I may meet some. Will put rest in touch with eva to flush out.


[01/05/2021 2:21 PM] kushti#0978
Savo promised to help, he's in Ergonauts already , and want to have overview of Foundation and Treasury activities, let's allow that ?

This chat is comparable to Ergonauts, but for our team China sub-group (if you go to the chat, I think you'll see it doesn't make sense to include it in Ergonauts). Mostly in Chinese but WeChat has auto-translate feature.

[01/07/2021 1:14 PM] morphic#4133
Starting form 2021 crypto assets operations become regulated in Russia (very poorly, but still). Unfortunately the new law, which is effective as of 01.01.2021 forbids using crypto assets as compensation for work and services done by both individuals and companies staying in Russia for more than 181 days during any 12 months period. The consequences of violation is not specified and will be specified later during 2021. This means sending Ergs to the team members living in Russia it now illegal and we shouldn't do this.

In addition the existing AML and Financing of Terrorism law was amended to embrace crypto assets. It now requires a formal declaration of all ownership of crypto assets. Basically in 2022 I will have to inform Tax Agency with the list of my addresses and the amount of assets I have. The concrete details of such declaration (document form and amount of necessary information with supporting docs) will be defined during 2021. But, I'm sure the source of this assets should be fully uncovered and legitimate to make those assets also legitimate. Violation of this law falls under criminal code and punishable by up to 3 years in prison.
Happy new year!

@morphic in India they beg people to report gold holdings, sounds like fear campaign without any details or definitions so far, probably you will be able to send cryptoruble or different stablecoins and if you wish to report silver, gold or tomatoes, apples from your garden or Bitcoin from 2012 bought on exchange that doesn't exist or mined, that`s your choice, Happy new year


[01/07/2021 7:51 PM] mx#5165
usually you will report amount you sold for fiat in specific year if you want to support the state, hard to say what is connections between banks and state in Russia but in different countries, banks don`t report any personal balances or source of your fiat to tax institutions or state, they report specific transaction to check for laundering above specific limits, that's why centralized exchanges with KYC are tried being made or expected to report things to tax institutions


[01/07/2021 9:18 PM] morphic#4133
Unfortunately, It will not be enough to just sell crypto assets and report income. If the amount of income is more than 600000 RUB (~$8000) per in a year, the source of the assets should be disclosed as well (this is required by AML law). 
I'm looking for a legal way to continue receiving Ergs, so far I don't see an acceptable schema. Going against law is not an option for me. 
Maybe it is time for Foundation to create legal entity.


[01/07/2021 9:21 PM] mx#5165
@morphic so at the moment you are free lancer being rewarded by decantralized entity not registered anywhere?


[01/07/2021 9:23 PM] morphic#4133
yes, kind of. Formally speaking I'm unemployed.


[01/07/2021 9:25 PM] mx#5165
yes, and they need to include somehow digital currencies in regulations at the same time, also probably not only cryptoruble but the ones from different countries as well, their point is to make people to use and accept only them so probably it won`t be counted as income from "crypto asset" finally


[01/07/2021 9:30 PM] mx#5165
in Ergo case, making foundation legal entity will only make things worse imo, now there is lots of ways to bypass whatever they come up with


[01/07/2021 9:30 PM] morphic#4133
they included all crypto assets (doesn't matter where they are issued and how) in the law as "property". Once you declare the amounts of assets you have, they become your legitimate "property". After that you can sell them and get fiat to the bank account. You get income only when you sell the property.


[01/07/2021 9:31 PM] mx#5165
can you show me the definition of cryptoasset including stablecoins and cbds made by Russia?


[01/07/2021 9:32 PM] mx#5165
Bitcoin in China is property, stablecoin is not or any POS

e-CNY, while utilizing blockchain, is a centralized substitution for China's M0 money (banknotes, coins). The offline & anonymous payment ensures only PBOC can trace the money flow. In future, merchants can decline AliPay/WeChat Pay, but forbidden to decline payments in e-CNY.

[01/07/2021 9:45 PM] morphic#4133
maybe in future, it is nothing like this ATM, just basic definitions and restrictions in the law.


[01/07/2021 9:46 PM] morphic#4133
The law is more about allowing banks to both issue and process crypto assets.


[01/07/2021 9:47 PM] mx#5165
yes, from interesting things, libra is to launch early this year, they only thing so far they managed to limit is to make them to use only usd and forget about backing by foreign currencies


[01/07/2021 9:48 PM] mx#5165
banks probably will be also market makers officially


[01/07/2021 9:49 PM] morphic#4133
In the Russian low they define things like: registry of users, restoration of lost access to the user funds etc. This has nothing to do with public blockchains we know and love.


[01/07/2021 9:50 PM] morphic#4133
This looks more like a step towards what Square and PayPal is doing with their digital wallets.

we have cryptocurrency tax from from few years, it is enough if you can`t say the cost of your cryptocurrency income, you need to show fiat conversion for specific year with doc from exchange

while nothing from public blockchains, mining is regulated, so basically a good will


[01/07/2021 10:05 PM] mx#5165
this is my usual comment in tax from and from most people from Poland that don`t use companies for trading or mining etc, revenue received from the sale of bitcoins in 2012, no tax deductible costs - no confirmation of purchase possible


[01/07/2021 10:07 PM] morphic#4133
I hoped it was  the same here, but they prohibit using crypto as payment and require declaration of existing funds. It is still unclear how it will work in practice.

i guess i could even send RUB bank transfer from my Bitcoin prepaid card if needed, so let`s see what is the best way for now, looks like also crypto card is coming to you shortly https://advcash.gi/en/solutions/card/

then you can fund it with bitcoin or whatever

@mx when you do transfer in Scrill, can you get a receipt? 
since I already have an account in Alfabank, we can test this way (which seems optimal so far) using small amount (100 RUB) transfer, and then I will chat with the guys in the bank about this transfer, is it suitable for this tax schema.

With Skrill you can do more and pay less when you send and receive money. We keep our fees for online money transfers low and totally transparent.


[01/07/2021 11:47 PM] mx#5165
on my account it shows 4,99% hmm, will check

For transactions involving currency conversion Skrill adds a fee of 3.99% to our wholesale exchange rates. The exchange rates vary and will be applied immediately without notice to you.

@mx what about SWIFT transfer, can you do that?


[01/08/2021 9:28 AM] kushti#0978
I also think to declare Ergs got from EF (as transfers are not private anyway). However, I think to consider them as donations, as my contributions to Ergo are not depending on amount of donations from any entities nor existence of such entities, thus it is not appropriate to talk about work or services here. I need to consult with a lawyer though.


[01/08/2021 10:35 AM] morphic#4133
Interesting, looking forward to what is the lawyer's opinion.  It can also work for me as my situation is pretty much the same. However, if Erg is a "property" according to law, is it ok to donate property?


[01/08/2021 10:59 AM] kushti#0978
@morphic yes, donations can be in any form, taxation would be tricky though (there's a gift tax of 30%, not sure if it is applied though)


[01/08/2021 11:05 AM] morphic#4133
self-employment tax is applicable if total income - expenses is less than 2400000 RUB per year. In such a case it looks like the best legal solution, but I need to check with the bank. With the current Erg price $0.55 getting 5000 Ergs are equal to 200000 which is just right fit.

[01/08/2021 6:19 PM] mx#5165
however you will probably then need to use standard tax form, before new cryptocurency form appeard we had to use "Copyright" tax form for cryptocurrency

[01/08/2021 6:29 PM] mx#5165
@kushti if the trick you mention works, it will be nice way to avoid new forms at all, so they don`t really know still if you got anything from cryptocurrrency, with new forms i put there only small amounts, with old forms bigger as then they can't connect it with your holdings at all

[01/19/2021 9:12 AM] Justin1000#9555
Me and @Noah met with this guy (ÂÆâÈë´Èë´ An Xinxin) at this event today and talked to him for about 2 hours. He is CEO of Jinse, probably the biggest crypto media platform in China. I didn‚Äôt know this even a month ago but in China to promote successfully its necessary to have a partnership with a media group like Jinse. There are some other popular ones but the one that likes Ergo the most and has been most responsive and helpful has been Jinse - they are the ones who published that article for free that seemingly led to Saturday‚Äôs price boost. They also happen to be the biggest in terms of users.


[01/19/2021 9:12 AM] Justin1000#9555
Among other things, they like Ergo because:
-Eva got them to have their technical guys look at it and they liked what they saw
-Ergo has Western development team with people on the ground here. both Chinese and Westerners in China -> big advantage. Chinese prefer western projects because they have more confidence in the technical capability and believe them less likely to be scams


[01/19/2021 9:12 AM] Justin1000#9555
Can take a look at the PDF below for what they will do for us over 1 year. Its good list and maybe a game changer for our marketing and price of Ergs. Also, I think they will do a lot more than that. This is like the minimum. For example, the CEO told us we could send out a news release everyday and not be limited to 5 a month. This would be Eva translating a twitter post into Chinese and blasting out on their site.


[01/19/2021 9:12 AM] Justin1000#9555
So for the 1 year partnership they ask for 70-80k Ergs. No need for USDT. Presumably they will hold them at least for a while. He asked how they could get more‚Ä¶I told him 1) mining (they got mining pool and he seemed interested as next step); 2) develop app and monetize ‚Äì they have developers and this might work but they will probably be cautious on that‚Ä¶China isn‚Äôt on forefront of app development; 3) other future partnerships with the Ergo Foundation.


[01/19/2021 9:13 AM] Justin1000#9555
In comparison, Eva also reached out to a few other big media groups. They weren‚Äôt willing to take Ergs. Tuoniao asked for USDT 70k; Shenlian UDST 72k and a technical group which does detailed analysis of technology called Mima Jike is 300-800k RMB (but they would be separate from the Jinse/Tuoniao/Shenlian as technical focused‚Ä¶Eva is continuing to talk to them today). With the recent price rise in Ergo, the difference in the 70-80k Ergs versus what Tuoniao and Shenlian are asking for is not so great now but: 1) Jinse told us 70-80k Ergs when price was at 50 cents showing they are really bullish on Ergo and probably a large portion of price gains over past few days is their posting of the articles for free; 2) Jinse is willing to take Ergs; 3) all indication from talking to lots of people is that Jinse is the biggest and best single media group although Shenlian and Tuoniao are also good as well as a few others. I am keen on going with Jinse‚Ä¶especially given we now have a direct relationship with CEO and basis for a great partnership.


[01/19/2021 9:14 AM] Justin1000#9555
Not too much risk involved here but a couple things I thought of:
1)    Maybe Jinse doesn‚Äôt deliver what they say ‚Äì seems basically no chance of this though. They have a reputation to protect by delivering and they are really positive on Ergo and have already started helping. I think they will do a lot more than minimum, not less‚Ä¶especially with Eva aggressively getting the most out of them.
2)    Regulation ‚Äì some chance there is a regulatory change in China that makes marketing really hard. But this is always a risk in crypto and there is no indication of impending detrimental regulations. I raised this with the CEO‚Ä¶he said he also didn‚Äôt think was big risk but if something temporary did happen could always delay marketing for a short time until clarity then pick back up.


[01/19/2021 9:14 AM] Justin1000#9555
They also got a wallet coming out and he said could add Ergo to it.


[01/19/2021 9:15 AM] Justin1000#9555
Also, this guy was part of the team at Huobi in 2015. He wouldn‚Äôt make any promises on listing there but the connection could certainly help especially later when Ergo really starts taking off! He said many 2nd tier exchanges would definitely come find us as a result of partnership. But I still think to list at Huobi, Binance, OKEx, we need a lot more users and attention and this partnership with Jinse maybe a big part of that.


[01/19/2021 9:16 AM] Justin1000#9555
If the price goes up because of our marketing in China...then would finally have resources to do more marketing internationally especially marketing aimed at getting more developers in.


[01/19/2021 9:16 AM] Justin1000#9555

Nice work @Justin1000 and @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ on connecting with the CEO, definitely makes propositions like this much more attractive since we'll know we have a stronger relationship if we go forward with this.


[01/19/2021 9:46 AM] Robert K#0722
Imo I think doing something like this makes more sense than going for a new exchange for us right now. New exchanges have done effectively nothing to attract more users or get the price to rise, but one Jinse article literally added 40%+ to the price


[01/19/2021 9:47 AM] Robert K#0722
Exchanges are asking for funds within the same order of magnitude, but are only giving us 1 announcement and then effectively just diluting liquidity making it worse for people to buy Ergs.


[01/19/2021 9:49 AM] Robert K#0722
I'm in favour of doing this push in China, as we already have some proof its had palpable effects, and if we accept this 1 year partnership, that gives us a good period of time to test pushing Ergo into China.


[01/19/2021 9:50 AM] Robert K#0722
Being realistic we don't have any other good connections/options for doing marketing otherwise, and we really do need more marketing, so I think this is the right choice.

great work, @Justin1000 , @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ, and Eva. Something I did not get is they asked for 75K Erg (or $75k in Ergs) but the pdf indicates 2 or 5 BTC. Does they offer differs from pdf? or there is a discount for ergo?
btw, it seems it had a good result on price.
Development and even getting listed on exchanges requires price spike and people's attention. So, it would be wise to do such partnerships with big media.
also, approving this payment as a minimum, I wonder if we can negotiate with them to pay more on some conditions met. For example, if we can define some metrics (like price, listing on houbi etc, defined number of chinese followers in tw, tg, or wechat etc, or any other sensible metrics), we can agree to pay some ergs for each milestone.

[01/19/2021 12:55 PM] Justin1000#9555
70 to 80k Ergs not USD. So seems 2 BTC is special discounted rate for "quality" projects and they are giving a further discount for Ergo and accepting Ergs too. It does appear to me they like Ergo and want to partner with good projects for benefit of their platform.


[01/19/2021 1:28 PM] morphic#4133

@Justin1000 good job! I think this is very important sign that they're willing to get ergs, hopefully they will be concerned about improving liquidity and pricing, unlike services asking for BTC/ USDT

[01/20/2021 12:08 PM] Justin1000#9555
Still waiting Jinse contract. Maybe slight delay cuz last night had Eva start thinking of anything else we can ask from them now. She discussed with them already. Probably can add some things like 1) KOL friend group but not sure how well will work; 2) we can go to the Jinse hosted conferences for free but if we want to go on stage probably still need to pay; 3) probably can join the their hackathon with Polkadot but won‚Äôt put this in contract cause our fee is low; 4) Listing on Huobi ‚Äì Eva seems to think if we give technical help to Heco ‚Äì Huobi ECO ‚Äì then we can maybe get on Huobi. I don‚Äôt know anything about this but anyway seems the Jinse CEO agreed with her could work + some other stuff not worth mentioning.


[01/20/2021 12:08 PM] Justin1000#9555
They were helping us more today. Press release out on the summit on their page. Also Eva has written an article in Chinese on the hard fork they will post.


[01/20/2021 12:10 PM] Justin1000#9555
The price of Erg is moving around. Guess it could change by time we finalize agreeement but I'm not sure we should try to change the 70-80k Erg amount if price goes up because they made that offer at around 50 cents but then started helping us for free which has apparently helped the price a lot. Anyway, probably can finalize arrangement with them soon anyway.

By the way, we shouldn't publicly announce we are doing partnership...especially paid one. Probably not common to announce those with media groups. I won't even discuss it in Ergonauts any further.

I agree with pretty much everything you stated above.


[01/20/2021 4:24 PM] Robert K#0722
It's kind of in bad faith to change the terms (how many Ergs) at this point when the price increase was via their help.


[01/20/2021 4:25 PM] Robert K#0722
And publicly announcing is probably not a great idea, better to just shill Jinse a lot whenever they post about Ergo.

@kushti @Robert K @morphic Should we have a developer outreach plan? Something could be unrolled after sumitt but defer to you guys on what form this would take. Seems that could be biggest source of low hanging fruit as we have the best tech in crypto and a mature protocol ready for DAPPs and monetization. But developers need 1 ) be aware of Ergo and 2) know how to build on it. I recall way back in 2018 Blockstack was having 2 hackathons a year with prizes and had a app ecosystem already but it wasn't as mature as Ergo is now.


[01/22/2021 1:45 AM] Justin1000#9555
I was hoping price gets up to at least like $2 or $3 or something before spending money on this but not sure if will happen or not in near-term. Maybe with our marketing efforts and news flow. But probably regardless, we need to spend $75 to 100k in 1st half of 2021 on developer outreach and similar amount during second half. More if $ERG price finally goes up!

I agree we should have a developer outreach plan, but the biggest thing we are missing to have that be a reality is an actual on-ramp for devs.

We have lots of great tools, but almost no good documentation, let alone clear guides to help people onboard.

It took me months to understand the EUTXO model of Ergo + understand how registers work + how off-chain/on-chain relate, and most people aren't that motivated.


[01/22/2021 10:00 AM] Robert K#0722
Which is why I've been saying we need to stop creating new tools ad-hoc, and make a real plan for what we want to be the default go-to tools in the ecosystem and create a path for people to learn the tools with guides, so that they then have the ability to actually build something

That was my point in creating the ErgoScript by example repo, because literally the only response we had for people who wanted to learn to write on-chain contracts is to read the complex whitepaper tutorials/random code on the forum, and good luck.


[01/22/2021 10:01 AM] Robert K#0722
No one has bothered to keep writing examples for that repo, which goes to show we kind of suck at organization and need to actually create a plan and stick to it so we can have good material, not just scatter our efforts randomly everywhere.


[01/22/2021 10:02 AM] Robert K#0722
Furthermore this was also the point for creating the Ergo Headless dApp Framework, to have a go-to off-chain solution with solid tutorials (https://github.com/Emurgo/ergo-headless-dapp-framework/blob/main/tutorials/Math_Bounty/1-math-bounty-dApp-getting-started.md)


[01/22/2021 10:04 AM] Robert K#0722
Scalahub has created an alternative to the HDF called the Json dApp Environment in the past 2 months, which is fine I guess, but it exemplifies my point that it's just kind of stupid we have no ability to co-ordinate a larger plan so that we can have our efforts build on top of each other rather than redoing stuff and having this complex ecosystem thats fragmented and with little documentation/educational material.


[01/22/2021 10:06 AM] Robert K#0722
We need to be able to take a new dev who may have a good knowledge of programming, but is new to the UTXO model & Ergo in general, and give them a whole A-Z education on what everything means, what are the go-to tools to start with and how do you use them, and then how can you take everything you learned and post it on-chain into a real dApp.


[01/22/2021 10:07 AM] Robert K#0722
At the current moment such a plan isn't even close to existing, and I've had an extremely challenging time trying to get anyone to really push in this direction over the past few months since I spent my own weekend creating the ErgoScript By Example repo which no one from the core devs even cared about besides Kushti.


[01/23/2021 2:48 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti What Robert said seems to make sense to me. Developing on Ergo is very different from any other platfrom and understanding its tweaks and how to do things on it is challenging for new comers. Not to mention, they will lack incentives at first as the ecosystem is not build out yet. Seems we need a plan from you to fix this and resources devoted to it. Is this something the core team can handle? Maybe should put some other things on hold and focus on this. So 1) a plan; 2) detailed documentation on how to do different things in building on Ergo; 3) new developer tools; 4) video tutorials. If some protocol enhancements need to be put on hold while this is done, would probably be worth it because as open permissionless platform all those developers can build on their own and come up with amazing stuff while core team can go back to working on base layer or other priorities.


[01/23/2021 2:49 AM] Justin1000#9555
Too bad ERG price is still not up or maybe it would be practical to hire a developer specifically for this job?


[01/23/2021 2:51 AM] Justin1000#9555
Also, I feel as though we should have 2 hackathons this year and 2 more next year with apps reviewed probably by @kushti and @Robert K . I suppose to have a successful hackathon you would pretty much need to resolve the above issues else noone would want to participate.


[01/23/2021 2:51 AM] Justin1000#9555
If can do a successful hackathon then probably have the tools and tutorials in sufficient quantity for most developers...I guess (I am not a developer so maybe wrong)

@Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ let me put you guys into wechat group with CoinTelegraph China CEO


[01/26/2021 2:10 AM] Justin1000#9555
Sounds good! I am already in one with him though plus some of their other China team. But still good if you do another intro and invite us into this chat. I got in touch with those guys in December through someone who had attended our meetup in Shanghai in 2019. Had a call with them and they wanted 1 BTC for me to give a talk at their awards summit in Sanya! But anyway, would be good to try and get a real relationship going. I think they will be wanting to build out aggressively in China now...


[01/28/2021 1:32 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
With all the momentum we have going now I wonder if it might be a good time to consider putting out a paid promotion piece on Youtube now?  I had contacted some crypto Youtubers in Sept/Oct last year and around that time:
1) DataDash Youtube (376K subscribers) 5-7 minute review for US$4,000;
2) Chico Crypto (173K subscribers) 3-5 minute video for US$10,000;

Also van on Tech (340K subscribers) in Dec. 2019 offered 20 minute review video + 2 mentions (5 minutes each) in two other daily videos for US$13k.

Should we follow up with any of these guys now and put out a Youtube video?

[01/28/2021 1:42 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
And how about CoinTelegraph? They have not done much coverage of Ergo. Disappointing, but not surprising to me. Maybe it's time we should consider giving them some incentive to want to give Ergo serious coverage? Maybe a partnership similar to what we will have with Jinse?
@kushti are you or someone in contact with their CEO Jay Cassano or someone else on their management team?


[01/28/2021 4:43 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ I think it might be worth doing but we should probably wait till after 1) Hard Fork; 2) Some of the China press to come out. Both of these things could potentially boost price making paying these guys a lot more affordable in ERG. Do you still have the memo from last year? I remember it had some pretty strong evidence in favor of Chico...I don't have it here.


[01/28/2021 5:19 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674

[01/28/2021 5:30 AM] Justin1000#9555
Well the case for Chico is pretty strong based on the precedents analysis but probably he has to get really behind a project to get those effects and I think we contacted him and made the case for Ergo but he didn't seem enthusiastic. $10k for a 5 minute video is probably not going to work for us.


[01/28/2021 9:57 AM] Robert K#0722
Yeah, I'm definitely not in favour of spending that much money for a crappy video


[01/28/2021 9:59 AM] Robert K#0722
Tbh I think there's a lot of saturation in the market for random new projects and I don't feel like 1-off short videos that have 0 substantive information is going to gain any traction


[01/28/2021 10:01 AM] Robert K#0722
We're not selling bullshit of blockhain 10.0 or whatever, and 5-7 minutes by someone who doesn't know anything about the project is going to be pretty unappealing since we're starting from sound principles and building good tech, not shiny new toys


[01/28/2021 10:02 AM] Robert K#0722
If you guys want you can vote for it, but I'm very skeptical.

Yes. I suspect the paid media partnerships are unique to the China market. I also didn't know until I got to mainland and was talking to lots of people on the ground.  Things are always different in China. CT is excellent but haven't stepped up on Ergo yet at all.


[01/28/2021 4:35 PM] Justin1000#9555
Our articles coming out on Jinse may pressure them to start delivering actually. They are trying to build out in China. Was talking to them in December. But mainly the work you are doing and the explosion in the Ergo ecosystem should bring them around.

Obviously it's not popular or talked about a lot, but it is kind of stupid to have random devs just use "Ergo Wallet" which confuses people especially when it's in super alpha version and not safe at all to store funds or work with anything in the ecosystem.

however I understand the difference between a wallet and other dapps.


[01/29/2021 12:47 PM] Robert K#0722
Well for a long while it didn't save the wallet locally, and if such basic features aren't implemented I kind of doubt it's particularly secure in general


[01/29/2021 12:48 PM] Robert K#0722
I think for dApps it's fine because dApps aren't associated to be always tied with the core development of the project.


[01/29/2021 12:48 PM] Robert K#0722
But when you literally just have `Blockchain Name` + `Wallet`


[01/29/2021 12:49 PM] Robert K#0722

[01/29/2021 12:50 PM] Robert K#0722
I would probably recommend that we don't publish anything about said wallet publicly from us and we message the creator to change the name to something unique so they get the message.


[01/29/2021 12:51 PM] Robert K#0722
And maybe make it policy for us going forward that as soon as someone tries to spin up a project that is named/advertises itself in such a way that seems to lean on the credability of the EF or core devs without actually being related to us, we act quickly to message them and make sure the community knows that it's not us.

I think we should make the wallet page of the site more informative. for example, divide wallets into official and community driven, short description of their capabilities (tokens, contracts, main usage, type (HD,BIP type), etc.), their security and ease of use. This way we can differentiate between the wallets we propose and/or support and other wallets

@mhs_sam @kushti I don't understand how the difficulty was set wrong? This is not good. We were supposed to have a bunch of articles and press coming out talking about how Ergo is the most profitable coin to mine. Instead in the wechat mining group which we have 71 members now people are complaining and saying going back to mining eth.


[02/02/2021 3:19 PM] Justin1000#9555
Will see how things shape out.  Maybe its just a timing thing of connecting to pools etc? But its not a good start for sentiment from what I see from the Chinese miners. May take some time to recover if doesn't shape up quickly. We made a lot of progress with miners lately in China but they will be turned off for some time possibly!


[02/02/2021 3:30 PM] mhs_sam#1471
which pool these Chinese miners using?


[02/02/2021 3:34 PM] Justin1000#9555
Don't know. But if there is no blocks and crap profitably then people are going to be turned off. This will really bad for sentiment. Is there any really no blocks for an hour? It's too bad the difficulty appears to have been set too high.


[02/02/2021 3:57 PM] mhs_sam#1471
fork happend. all pools are seeing hashrate decrease, BUT nanopool is growing in hashrate (most hashrate is in nanopool)


[02/02/2021 3:58 PM] mhs_sam#1471
went from 20 to ~40 in the last 30 mins


[02/02/2021 3:59 PM] mhs_sam#1471
interestingly, nanopool did not find the last block (so it seems there is a bigger player here)


[02/02/2021 6:14 PM] Justin1000#9555
Much better to have blocks every 20 seconds for an epoch or two than wait hours for a block! please consider if can lower the difficulty drastically as soon as possible as the miners are suggesting. Please consider lowering it a bit more than appears necessary in an abundance of caution.


[02/02/2021 6:15 PM] Robert K#0722

above issues "articles and press coming out talking about how Ergo is the most profitable coin to mine" this will be for sure not true till optimized software is available and till lots of miners jump in from different coins, we are balancing here with situation where pools don`t have optimized software yet


[02/02/2021 7:29 PM] mhs_sam#1471
anyway this is the estimation of me and bigEvil, based on the estimated hashrates of bigEvil. nothing to do with @kushti


[02/02/2021 7:29 PM] mhs_sam#1471
seems some miner jumped in and the blocks are mining faster


[02/02/2021 7:33 PM] mx#5165
estitmation was correct for max optimizations yes


[02/02/2021 7:35 PM] mx#5165
even with fixes in place, situation for small miners would be pretty similar with their existing number


[02/03/2021 6:02 AM] Justin1000#9555
A few small miners in Wechat like Ergo enough that they are looking at ways to buy it instead of mining it given they discovered cant mine even after fork. Many others attitudes not so good about it though. To the extent the mining optimizations get incorporated by the pools in a few [weeks?] and it is mostly a level playing field then miners will get back in soon enough. But as mentioned this is very poor for sentiment and opposite of what we were hoping for. On the positive from what I can see it seems opening up to mining pools really is having the desired effect of increasing adoption as we have many many small guys and bigger guys get involved in mining discussions with some sharing mining advice. A big increase in activity and interest.


[02/03/2021 6:17 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti Jinse partnership agreement and ERG address in your email for handling. They emailed over last night at 640 PM HKT. Took a while to finalize because 1) translation to ENG; 2) them setting up and testing wallet. But they have been helpful in publishing stuff for us in this period despite that. Also, I got them down to 70k ERGs from the 75k amount we discussed and voted on. So only need to send 70,000 ERGs.


[02/03/2021 6:30 AM] mx#5165
"To the extent the mining optimizations get incorporated by the pools in a few [weeks?]" usually it takes few months at least till big miners and pools release let`s say 90% optimized software to community, it should be faster now


[02/03/2021 6:33 AM] Justin1000#9555
Thanks...noted...guess we'll find out how long in our case soon enough.


[02/03/2021 6:42 AM] mx#5165
if difficulty would be lower, solo miner would need to exit totally basically at the moment, they always work in proportion, in big coins just through own pools


[02/03/2021 11:41 AM] kushti#0978
Sorry guys just found time to  visit this room. Anyway, I think this is good that the forking mess got minimized. Difficulty was set too high, my bad sure, we had conversations for long time about its value though. I guess Ethereum pump also affecting negatively on attractiveness of Ergo mining.


[02/03/2021 11:43 AM] kushti#0978
At this point I guess it is better to leave things as is and let the ecosystem to find a solution.


[02/03/2021 11:44 AM] kushti#0978

[02/06/2021 11:50 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yes, I saw this a few days ago. It didn‚Äôt excite me much because 1) we have our own presence now in China with Jinse partnership, Eva, more active wechats etc...not huge but highly scalable so I don‚Äôt think we are so desperate right now for more media exposure in China; 2) until $ERG price goes up more, I doubt would want to spend that $100k+ on China marketing. Consider it more of a luxury item right now that we seriously consider if $ERG price goes up. But would need to do a lot more looking into their background and alternatives.


[02/06/2021 11:50 AM] Justin1000#9555
Anyway, the difference in our China presence between now and last November is HUGE. We are in pretty good spot if keep up momentum.


[02/06/2021 11:51 AM] Justin1000#9555
One IMPORTANT thing to note: China shouldn‚Äôt lead the marketing effort. We really have a short fall it appears in our international marketing. Not enough detailed articles covering Ergo and its tech. Eva was alluding to this recently in telegram. At some point Chinese will want to see more foreign interest, foreign articles and foreign activity. One of the reasons they like Ergo is because its an international team of top developers and people around the world behind it so they will be looking for validation given by continue international interest. So this I think is biggest possible thing holding us back in China in short-term.


[02/06/2021 11:51 AM] Justin1000#9555
So not sure what the solution is but key issue I see right now is gap in our intnl marketing/news coverage: need more good detailed English articles on ERGO (not Cardano/Ergo combined if possible) and with a LOT more eyes on them. Then we will just pump those out through our China channels and we will get both Intnl and China exposure which will feed on itself.

[02/06/2021 1:29 PM] Robert K#0722
The biggest problem imo is that we don't really have a specific person who is dedicated to reaching out and doing marketing which is why it just feels like an empty hole in the team


[02/06/2021 5:21 PM] morphic#4133
1) With the recent price surge we can reserve some USD budget for Intl Marketing Lead full time position roughly $2000 + some ERGs for 1 year. 
We now can secure  $2000 * 12 = $24000 (15K ERGs for the price of 1.6 at the time of writing) which I think not that hard with the current daily volumes.
If we have enough work for a full time marketing position, let's hire someone who will do it professionally. 
2) Once the price is above $3 I think we should create some legal entity, do professional accounting of our funds and be able to pay fiat salary.
3) We also need to hire  developers because current situation is not sustainable in a long term when only kushti knows how the node works and only I know how sigma works (well Denis will probably be able to substitute me to maintain sigma if something happens, but I doubt Ilya will be able to substitute kushti)
4) So basically we need to develop a plan how we are going to grow our organization as the price grows, in which marketing is one piece of the whole picture.

[02/07/2021 10:25 AM] morphic#4133
@kushti As an idea to solve the difficulty problem on the network. Instead of paying fixed percent for all blocks you can pay it only for blocks which are mined late in time, i.e. those which were delayed. In this way you are compensating for actual lack of hash rate. 
I see at the end the last epoch the block interval was less than 30 sec, so I think it doesn't make sense to encourage excess HR at the end of each epoch. 
Just an idea.

When I talked about Ergo node I really meant ergoplatform/ergo repository and codebase. 
Strangely, I was invited to https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger-labs organization, but they should probably invite you instead as I don't see you in the members list. Looks like mistake.

[02/07/2021 10:49 AM] morphic#4133
Regarding difficulty adjustment, it looks like the current algorithm maybe unstable (this is my gut feeling) with respect to ERG price drops. 
If miners can easily switch between coins (which is the case when the main power comes from pools) they can jump out exactly when they are most needed. The price drop thus will be amplified  by the drop in hash rate and the algorithm is very slow to adjust the difficulty.
Is there a reason to adjust the difficulty based on 8 previous epochs rather than say 2 epochs (or even just one epoch)?


[02/07/2021 9:18 PM] kushti#0978
you can start with the paper behind Ergo difficulty adjustment method https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/731.pdf , coin hopping was one of the motivations there


[02/07/2021 9:21 PM] kushti#0978
Our algo will adjust slowly yes, but it is also preventing from adversarial hopping.


[02/07/2021 9:31 PM] kushti#0978
Talking about practicalities of mining, it seems not much attractive options for 3gb and soon 4gb (as Ethereum DAG is growing). We will compete with ETC mostly for some time. Hard to say when FPGAs will enter the game and how competitive they would be. Seems good for observable future.


[02/07/2021 9:33 PM] kushti#0978
Then miners will be incentivized to play with clocks )


[02/07/2021 9:35 PM] Robert K#0722
Btw @kushti how much have you been paying out to pools for extra rewards?


[02/07/2021 9:36 PM] Robert K#0722
Want to make sure we repay you for that.

Don't have time to read the whole paper, could you point to the paragraph where I can find the explanation of why slow adaptation is better than fast adaptation of difficulty?


[02/08/2021 10:48 AM] morphic#4133
In a long term yes, but I doubt they will bother doing this, especially when the rewards are announced for each epoch and there is no long term guarantee of such rewards.


[02/08/2021 7:40 PM] Robert K#0722
Miners sure do complain a lot. Quite the annoying mercenaries to deal with lol


[02/08/2021 7:43 PM] kushti#0978
@morphic how do you define fast and slow, to start with ?


[02/08/2021 7:45 PM] kushti#0978
Ergo is already using epoch length of ~1.5 days (with normal block rate), not Bitcoin's 2 weeks. However, more epochs considered, but retargeting function is non-linear also, so may adjust sooner than linear function in certain popular scenarios.


[02/08/2021 7:59 PM] mx#5165
most of small miners at this stage after so many Bitcoin clones, small coins trying to survive without anything above some algo etc don`t read basically anything about a coin, they are checking profitability while being all the time surrounded and tricked by big solo miners with better software and mostly through pools created by them, and Ergo is like only not broken ASIC resistant coin at the moment additionally, not worth discussing even, they will still jump basically like every hour after new difficulty kicks in different coin


[02/08/2021 8:06 PM] kushti#0978
we'll see new wave after getting on WTM I guess )


[02/08/2021 8:09 PM] mx#5165
miners mining Ergo from the start weren`t for sure some random guys from the street, well even with pools dropping there is still solo power like 30% at the moment again supporting


[02/08/2021 8:12 PM] mx#5165
and basically that 3 TH/s quick check from yesterday could be them, that would fit new algo assumptions

tbh I am more worried about the next epoch now


[02/08/2021 10:56 PM] kushti#0978
it will be super-easy, so we can witness increased number of orphaned blocks and forks


[02/08/2021 10:57 PM] kushti#0978
so going to check P2P layer in coming days, maybe will provide pools with recommendations, would make sense to close biggest exchanges also


[02/08/2021 10:57 PM] kushti#0978
hopefully it will be around Sun, so less people will be around


[02/09/2021 9:49 AM] mx#5165
if there are quick improvements possible sure, it will be pretty standard situation with new discovery of Ergo price so closing exchanges doesn`t have much sense, anyway they will announce you told them to do it

This is one of the ~20 screenshots from Savo posted in telegram of a conversation between him and that RO Advertising guy. Savo is saying he got 5.4k ERGs per month salary on the "Ergo team". As far as I know, that is an outright lie. I am not saying anything in particular should be done about it. Just posting it here for reference when considering how to deal with him in the future. As I assume you guys probably wouldn't read all those screenshots...just FYI


[02/10/2021 10:21 AM] Robert K#0722
He is definitely a liability at this point üòÖ


[02/10/2021 10:23 AM] Robert K#0722
In the future let's please make sure to do better background checks for people we want to bring into the inner Ergo circle/EF, especially when someone who was expedited as fast as Savo. I assumed Savo was already a friend and was already known to be good, not quite sure how he was chosen/found.


[02/10/2021 11:01 AM] Robert K#0722
Just saw the whole Telegram stupid wall of screenshots with Savo


[02/10/2021 11:02 AM] Robert K#0722
Tbh we should just kick him from everything, it's clear he's either drunk and stupid half the time, or just immature.


[02/10/2021 11:03 AM] Robert K#0722
He seems to just be an attention seeker who care more about his image than helping the project and isn't really providing any value.


[02/10/2021 11:03 AM] Robert K#0722
This is related to ergo-wallet shenanigans, where we need to make sure we protect our image as the EF and we can't just have people running around doing whatever they want, we need to be more decisive.


[02/10/2021 12:31 PM] morphic#4133
I don't remember we voted for Savo to be on any board. Or I missed something?


[02/11/2021 12:54 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674

[02/11/2021 1:44 PM] Robert K#0722
Not sure if he understands this is supposed to be a real project and not a replacement for a twitter feed to get him attention.


[02/11/2021 2:23 PM] Robert K#0722
So I think we should now also push for getting ledger support


[02/11/2021 2:23 PM] Robert K#0722
It seems like with this much demand we need to actually move forward with this.


[02/11/2021 2:26 PM] Robert K#0722
In that regard I think we should:
1. Message Jason Davies directly, and send him an official message from us at the EF that he has failed to fulfill his Ledger Grant by over 10x the claimed duration of the grant proposal. Due to this failure to deliver anything and on such a long time frame, we are closing his grant proposal officially and requesting that he returns the Ergs which he has received if he expects to pursue any further grants from the EF.


[02/11/2021 2:26 PM] Robert K#0722
2. I think Alex was saying he may know someone who could do the Ledger implementation. Let's push for this in whatever way we can.

I'm agree with the whole thing, but just wanna ask a question.
is there any conditions for grants in case of delivery failure? do we have something predefined?


[02/11/2021 4:42 PM] Robert K#0722
No I don't think we have anything.


[02/11/2021 4:42 PM] Robert K#0722
I think going forward we could institute a new policy:
First time grant submitters get 0 Ergs upfront, but 100% on completion.


[02/11/2021 4:43 PM] Robert K#0722
Tbh it shouldn't be a big deal anyways since we can be trusted to pay out, and I know other grant programs that only by 100% on milestones or completion


[02/11/2021 4:44 PM] Robert K#0722
So yeah maybe from here-forward we never pay up-front, but if someone really wants to get Ergs before 100% finished if it's a big project, then we can have smaller milestones where they must release their work publicly.

Cool, so I'm starting to talk with one of the two leads for ledger support (the smaller team that will likely cost less) and they said they'll need a few days to scope out the project and see how much work it'll be.


[02/12/2021 9:01 AM] Robert K#0722

[02/12/2021 10:37 AM] Robert K#0722
In regards to Yoroi mobile support, it seems that the current status of sigma-rust for mobile is that it is in a very raw state.


[02/12/2021 10:38 AM] Robert K#0722
A lot of work needs to be done to flesh it out and do bindings specifically for react-native so that we can use it and provide Ergo support.


[02/12/2021 10:40 AM] Robert K#0722
This technically isn't part of wallet integration, as much as building basic tooling in the ecosystem, and as such from Emurgo's perspective it seems that the EF should fund the development of a mobile SDK that supports react-native.


[02/12/2021 10:41 AM] Robert K#0722
And so would you guys be fine with giving out a grant (potentially to the same guys who I'm talking with for ledger integration too, and they have a lot of mobile experience specifically) for them to write bindings for sigma-rust for react native?

yes, would be great, looks like we have one core developer for each huge part of Ergo what is for sure not enough


[02/12/2021 10:53 AM] mx#5165
@kushti eventually just tell him that grant has been passed to different developer and what he got he can keep for his previous help


[02/12/2021 10:57 AM] Robert K#0722
If he could at least provide us with whatever he has done at this point, that would probably be helpful in order to not redo everything.


[02/12/2021 10:58 AM] Robert K#0722
But otherwise it's just not worth waiting a single day longer for him, as he's proven his promises don't really mean much.


[02/12/2021 11:00 AM] Robert K#0722
And if we don't just tell him it's over, he's going to keep saying "soon" "soon" "soon". So best to just tell him up front the grant is done, if you want to help us out and give us your current code then great, otherwise oh well.


[02/12/2021 11:19 AM] mx#5165
yes, he is rather only sharing things that can bring him something, he was developing so many things that whole ecosystem should be already complete üôÇ hard to say if that few security fixes he did are being funded by someone else, he always appears in strange moments


[02/12/2021 11:25 AM] mhs_sam#1471
@Robert K I personally talked with the RO guy, which is persian like me. seems they were playing some gambling and savo refused to pay for his loss. This is not important at all to me. the important thins is the guy claiming to have deep connections with us AND claiming he is a hedge fund manager (the youngest on the earth). In fact, he is using this bullshits to rob people and RO might be not the first one.
I remember savo sent me some investment plans üôÇ
Actually we do not know how many peoples hurt because of him, btw needs actions from us. at least telling in some groups that he has no connections with EF or any Ergo stuff.
I was suspicious to his activities days ago and told @kushti about him. I heard he was also very offensive with AltcoinBuzz guys.


[02/12/2021 11:30 AM] mhs_sam#1471
On ledger, we need it ASAP. lots of people do not hold (trading is different) alts that cannot be kept on ledger (including myself).
on jason, I am not the fan of the idea to take the money back (if there was no agreement at the first place). depends on the amount thoughüòÜ

Oh wow.

[02/12/2021 12:19 PM] Robert K#0722
@kushti So I asked DeadIT and Savo does still has access to the public telegram groups. Should we ban him completely?


[02/12/2021 12:20 PM] Robert K#0722
I'm leaning with @mhs_sam to yes, because I don't really see any benefits at this point.


[02/12/2021 12:25 PM] mhs_sam#1471
I'm not sure but I remember I saw some messages from him even in this channel.


[02/12/2021 12:40 PM] Robert K#0722
And if we do ban him it might be a good idea for community transparency if @kushti goes on Telegram and tells everyone something like:


[02/12/2021 12:42 PM] Robert K#0722
"A small notice for the community. Savo was brought into the team to support us in our marketing efforts to get Ergo out to a wider audience. After a couple months trial we have decided to part ways and are now looking for someone new to fill in this role. If you know someone who would be a great fit for this position, feel free to reach out and contact us at ergoplatform@protonmail.com "


[02/12/2021 12:43 PM] Robert K#0722
Because if we ignored it it'll look bad, might as well make it look like an opportunity for the community to get hired.


[02/12/2021 12:45 PM] mhs_sam#1471
Not agree with the details of this message, since we are admit that he had something official to do with us and we hired him.


[02/12/2021 12:45 PM] Robert K#0722
Well the problem is everyone already thinks that


[02/12/2021 12:45 PM] Robert K#0722
Because Savo said stupid stuff like "I'm leading managing everything"


[02/12/2021 12:45 PM] Robert K#0722
And we didn't respond at all


[02/12/2021 12:46 PM] Robert K#0722
And let him say it


[02/12/2021 12:46 PM] Robert K#0722
Which is why we need to be on top of this stuff immediately


[02/12/2021 12:46 PM] mhs_sam#1471
we should say that he was a community member and nothing more


[02/12/2021 12:46 PM] Robert K#0722
But that doesn't make sense and will raise further questions


[02/12/2021 12:46 PM] Robert K#0722
Why was he in the Ergo Summit


[02/12/2021 12:46 PM] Robert K#0722
why did we not say anything for weeks when he claimed otherwise?


[02/12/2021 12:47 PM] mhs_sam#1471
btw, I am not aware if we had any stuff with him? do we?


[02/12/2021 12:50 PM] mhs_sam#1471
that's awful. actually I was thinking he is an important guy in ergo til I asked from @kushti . so anyway, if we had relations with him we should tell and make it clear that this relationship is at its end and accept the consequences. otherwise, it is much easier, just ban him and kick him off anywhere and publicly announcing that he was a community member and was not officially affiliated with Ergo, we think his actions is harmful to the community so we banned him.


[02/12/2021 12:51 PM] Robert K#0722
So I think Alex brought him in for doing marketing and managment, and so he was taking part for a month or two.


[02/12/2021 12:52 PM] Robert K#0722
And he was doing some stuff, so he was working with us, and so he wasn't strictly lying that was doing management work, just he sucked at it and screwed up everything pretty much


[02/12/2021 12:53 PM] Robert K#0722
So it makes more sense to be clear about that publicly and that it is the end of this relationship especially since he made it so public and he was at the Ergo Summit.


[02/12/2021 12:53 PM] Robert K#0722
Otherwise rumours will spread and it will be worse if we say he wasn't related to us and it'll just be a bigger problem.


[02/12/2021 12:55 PM] mhs_sam#1471
maybe you're right. anybody knows his relationship with ergo?
btw, being in Summit is the tricky part


[02/12/2021 1:36 PM] mx#5165
last part seems right as noone has any idea about it above that he was to be coordinator, rest is personal talks with Alex or someone else from Ergonauts channel and looks like he was additionally personally rewarded before to do some tasks and started talks with different parties and that`s why he says he is part of core team and still updating about exchanges etc

He came to me complaining every time he got reprimanded for fucking up, including when he slept it and his main job was directing the weekly call so we can stay organized and I was nice to him.

And he's too self centered to do anything but whine and make up stories.

Btw can we trust that Rohan isn't going to be a problem for us too? He seems good for now, but just a thought since he was recommended by Savo


[02/12/2021 6:13 PM] mx#5165
at least he is only in Ergonauts channel, Savo proposed him 0 money for trial so rather looked to him like worker than friend


[02/12/2021 6:14 PM] Robert K#0722
Right, should be fine. Plus he's really just going to be helping organize and he's not public so won't really have much leverage to try and lie about anything publicly.

"I don‚Äôt know what the story is around Savo. However, it would be a good idea for marketing and business development if the Ergo Foundation was indeed incorporated, if it is not. (One of his claims). 

For the opening I would recommend a friend of mine who is somewhat familiar with the project.

She is bilingual Russian/English.

She has a strong background in business development, analytics, advertising, strategic planning and customer service. 

She is currently working in Dubai and has been exploring alternative fields. 

She is aware I submitted this recommendation. Thank you for your consideration.

[02/13/2021 4:46 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
@morphic @kushti @Robert K 3) how can we proceed with hiring (a) developer(s)? 

1) Regarding marketing, I think that at least just as important as having a dedicated marketing person and regular new content (articles) is that we need to have a steady drip of new articles published regularly on 3rd party platforms such as CoinTelegraph (and/or Yahoo finance / Forbes / Etc. for example but probably CoinTelegraph is best, off the top of my head without having done any research).

In order to have regular content published on 3rd party platforms, I think we need at least either 1) A partnership with CoinTelegraph or similar platform; 2) Side partnership(s) directly with CoinTelegraph journalist(s) or writer(s). In this case someone from Ergo community could draft an article but our partner,  subject to his approving the content, would publish under his name on CoinTelegraph; or 3)  Regular "guest posts" by 3rd party writers published on 3rd party platforms and blogs.  This is similar to #2 but is done more ad hoc and a la cart. This I think can maybe be secured with agencies such as thehoth.com. 
By the way, I used https://www.thehoth.com/guestpost/. back in 2018 when I was trying to do marketing for my ayahuasca retreat center in Iquitos Peru (sold in mid 2019 before the plandemic thankfully).

Also since we actually already have a lot of good Ergo articles, I think it would make sense for us to use some kind of "Content Distribution & Syndication Service" where we could get our already existing content distributed on other media and platforms.

[02/13/2021 9:48 AM] Robert K#0722
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ What would be the minimum amount of funding we would have to commit to, in order to try HOTHSyndication? I think it's a good idea, but I tend to imagine such services just put out crappy ads and get clicked farmed by bots, which makes me not that trusting of it working.


[02/13/2021 9:50 AM] Robert K#0722
In regards to developers, if we end up giving the small dev team I know the ledger grant + a grant for building out a mobile SDK on top of sigma-rust, that is one way will allow us to have someone to outsource building some tooling to, so that's at least one path that is approachable going forward.


[02/13/2021 9:50 AM] Robert K#0722
In terms of attracting new devs more grassroots, then that is always very challenging because every blockchain has this problem.

Regarding marketing efforts

FYI, I went to cointelegraph.com under altcoin news https://cointelegraph.com/tags/altcoin and noticed a few of the writers, one of them named Jordan Finneseth. He (along with others) are not in the websites "About" section so I guess that they are freelance writers. I found Jordon on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/synchronisticawareness/ and just sent him the following LinkedIn message:
Hi Jordan, 

I'm Noah, a fellow crypto enthusiast and also a believer that crypto is on the brink of changing the world (for the better!). With my current involvement, I see what I believe should be breaking crypto news and stories that are currently under-reported in CoinTelegraph and other media. For example, new DeFi "OraclePools", AgeUSD stable coin and even something Charles Hoskinson calls "a technical marvel & thinks it should have a top 10 market cap." (https://twitter.com/luke_arnolds/status/1360681886633365510?s=20).

I hope to get this kind of news out to the people, and I think it would be invaluable to the writer who is early to publish it. Actually, I am aware of this content already written (on smaller blogs and forums), but just not yet published on large media platforms, something that I am keen to see happen!

Hope we can discuss further. Please feel free to reply to me here or contact direct by email at noah.hudson@protonmail.com

 Thanks,
Noah Hudson

I think after he replies I can start a private chat with him and also add everyone here in the foundation. Then we can all have the chance to vet him (or at least passively have a record of the process) as a team, and then maybe consider inviting him to Ergonauts or maybe even some specific role.


[02/15/2021 12:43 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Just noticed @mx 's addition of CoinTelegraph writer Antonio in Ergonauts shortly after I had already contacted Jordan. I was thinking of reaching out cold to even more writers, but I will pause for now. I think now since  we already have Antonio willing to help, he deserves the  chance to show what he can do, and if he can deliver then he deserves the spotlight as one of the early journalists to report on Ergo. Would be pretty heartless I think if  I were to now try to recruit more writers. I'll follow up with Jordan though if he replies since I had already contacted him.

"There are multiple viable jurisdictions to incorporate the Ergo Foundation. My personal recommendation is that the foundation sets its roots where it believes ERG has the greatest long-term potential. This may come from partnerships or areas of commercial adoption. I would recommend either the USA, Asia, or Switzerland. Caribbean countries are also a possibility, however more research would be needed to isolate the best choices. 

In the United States the best jurisdiction is Wyoming. This state is creating a strong reputation of backing the cryptocurrency industry. Some believe this may become the new Silicon Valley of crypto. Establishing in this jurisdiction early may assist in creating long term partnerships in the USA as this industry develops.

If Asian markets offer greater growth opportunity and partnerships for the EF, Singapore or Japan appear to offer the greatest opportunity. This may offer proximity to commercial partners that could be beneficial to the long term growth and adoption of ERG in Asia.  

There is also the possibility of incorporating in Zug, Switzerland. This is the mainstream, popular choice and tends to create a favorable reputation worldwide.

If the Ergo Foundation has a preference, discuss internally and let me know. I would be happy to donate time, talk to different firms and get some quotes.

Armeanio"

"A newer option that could also be beneficial to the long term financial health of the Ergo Foundation would be Dubai. This is not well known as it is a recent push to modernize. The Government has been pushing for Dubai to become a hi-tech hub . 

Dubai is working on establishing a cryptocurrency valley with special terms in the country's free zone where there is no personal or corporate income tax.

Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), a Dubai government-backed entity has teamed up with Switzerland's Crypto Valley Venture Capital to implement the idea. Here is more information regarding the UAE Blockchain 2021 Agenda.

Moving my messages here from @exchanges channel
1) If we now have $250K to spend, I suggest to spend them on incorporating a legal entity, hiring professional software engineers (maybe even through head-hunting agencies) and start paying USD salary when it is necessary


[02/16/2021 9:58 AM] morphic#4133
2) I need to remind that starting form 2021 I cannot accept ERGs legally for my work while being Russian tax resident, same as kushti and any other guys in Russia. So legal entity and USD salary is something I'm waiting for now.


[02/16/2021 9:58 AM] morphic#4133
3) For software engineering candidates we need a kind of universal soldiers (Denis can be a role model) who also have experience and are interested in scalable distributed databases (processing).


[02/16/2021 9:59 AM] morphic#4133
4) The candidates must pass coding interview and also design interview. I can do coding interview for relevant candidates (I did it a lot in Huawei). The design interview should be done by someone else (kushti, robert) just to have a different opinion on the candidate. Basically our requirements are very similar to what Google, Amazon and other big tech companies are looking for in candidates.


[02/16/2021 9:59 AM] morphic#4133
5) The hiring process is pretty standard: 
- search for candidates and initial HR interview/screening (can be outsourced)
- review relevant candidate CVs (get 2 opinions out of (me, kushti, Robert, Denis))
- give each candidate 2-3 weeks for preparation
- coding interview (me, Denis potentially)
- give each candidate 4-6 weeks for preparation
- design interview (me, kushti, Robert)
- bonuses negotiation (EF)
- contract signing (EF)
The hiring process above is widely accepted in the software development and with high probability provides good hirings.


[02/16/2021 10:00 AM] morphic#4133
6) I need to mention that we don't need blockchain experts. We need professional software engineers who can "do stuff": write quality code predictably, chase bugs, profile performance, do code review, proactively improve quality of the code, have problem-solving abilities and good clear communication style.


[02/16/2021 10:28 AM] mx#5165
"Hello there, I hope everything is well with you. I saw your message in the telegram group about parting ways with Savo RPC and you needed someone to fill up this role. I was following Ergo Platform since last summer and I've been learning about blockchain use cases, financial systems and monetary policies for almost a year. I participated in article competition last January and I've been awarded for 3rd place with my The Ergo Platform And What You Need To Know article. I'm a sociology student at Galatasaray University and I can speak/write English, French and Turkish(native). 

What I can offer is 

- I can manage public communication
- I can manage marketing organisation
- I can write consumer oriented articles
- I can make weekly/monthly recaps, videos, newsletters

Or if you have something else in mind you think that can suit me please let me know. I really like to work with you and I think that would be a fun experience for both of us as I'm funny and creative. I'm hoping to hear from you soon. Take care!

@morphic "So legal entity and USD salary is something I'm waiting for now."- for whom are you waiting ?


[02/16/2021 1:34 PM] kushti#0978
@morphic in regards with hiring, I guess we need to define scope specifically. In general I do not agree that we don't need for "blockchain experts", we had many issues already with professional devs which do not understand what they're doing, and a lot of bad experience around. But 1 dev like that would be good for helping us for sure.

Seems to me best for the Foundation to move to a DAO with on-chain proposals and voting etc. And not even do a legal entity. But I suppose this is not practical/possible at least in near-term. And seems to be possible need to pay people out of a legal entity.


[02/17/2021 5:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
Since Ergo is for the entire world and not targeted at a specific region, I would suggest NOT incorporating in a ‚Äúnon-neutral‚Äù location like the US. Maybe that applies to Asia as well including HK. So perhaps Switzerland is best option. But alternatives might be Caribbean like Caymans or possibly BVI. In making decision, factors include 1) long-term sustainability and regulator clarity; 2) tax issues; 3) cost to set up and maintain

For me, I have probably the best lawyers in BVI but from past discussions seems BVI didn‚Äôt have a pure non-profit entity (something called ‚Äúcharitable trusts‚Äù instead) and so probably won‚Äôt be helpful but I will check in with them anyway.

I think the big problem with EF and also ergonauts group is that for most of its members it is working like Department of Good Wishes. Someone is expressing some good thought and that's it. While expressing thoughts is very valuable, this is going to nowhere without actions.

I think this is a bad joke that a core developer is handling support requests, doing accounting, talking with exchanges, wallets, pool, partnerships, tweeting and so on. We've got to that state after mainnet launch unfortunately when catena left and his centralized and passive team got paralyzed and others were suppressed by low price and lack of public support it seems. Now things can be done differently. Even more, we can not continue to do things like now.


[02/17/2021 9:13 AM] Robert K#0722
Alright, so it's probably not worth me pushing for the guys I know for ledger implementation?


[02/17/2021 9:15 AM] kushti#0978
Happily we have very active community now, Chinese team is doing great job. For coordinating tech support etc I think to put Rohan into dedicated channels (new TG group, existing discord rooms, dedicated support email). Rohan is trying to organize marketing activities with Trello and regular calls, I think to put a secretary, maybe Rohan as well, on some other matters.


[02/17/2021 9:15 AM] kushti#0978
Let's see how it goes.


[02/17/2021 9:15 AM] Robert K#0722
I generally agree on this sentiment as well. Lots of good ideas but most don't willing take responsibility for a new idea and execute it themselves.


[02/17/2021 9:15 AM] Robert K#0722
Now is a good time to get order in place for sure.


[02/17/2021 9:19 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 actually we can do DAO , and then some small company may apply and get funds to pay devs. We need for UI and also to  add new sigs to the Treasury contract (doable). We have ZKT already as a raw sketch.

[02/17/2021 1:03 PM] morphic#4133
I don't think EF should execute tasks. I see it more like key decision making and strategical planning and funds spending and results assessment. 
Even more, I think execution MUST be separated from EF, so that the judgments and assessments are not rigged and are both independent and objective.
This means the execution MUST be delegated to some entity with CEO on top, reporting to EF.
If we don't have such CEO, we need to find him/her. Even if at the beginning he will be the only employee in the entity, we need to fill this gap in the team.
It is the gap, because nobody is willing to do this job full time and I think that is completely ok. 
Thus, we need to find a new person for the very specific role with potential and capabilities to grow into CEO, while also ready to do all the work alone at the beginning. 
We need to publish this position on a job market, generate a stream of relevant applications with relevant CVs, and ideally we need to being able to choose from around 10 suitable candidates and choose the best one. 
We followed a similar process in Huawei, but I was at the receiving part of the process starting from CV assesment and further to interviewing and hiring. 
I don't have experience in hiring for CEO position though.


[02/17/2021 1:36 PM] kushti#0978
@morphic alright, so what will you do ?


[02/17/2021 1:38 PM] kushti#0978
@mx are you publishing Nautilus' materials ?


[02/17/2021 1:40 PM] morphic#4133
the same I do now, I don't plan any changes until I finish with v5.0. 
I wrote about this already, nothing changed.


[02/17/2021 1:57 PM] kushti#0978
@morphic my question was about the text above, if you can search for CEO, will you do something different, from whom are you expecting to search for CEO etc


[02/17/2021 2:08 PM] morphic#4133
no, I will not search, this is a lot of work, and specific work actually, and I think this work should be outsourced to professional agency.


[02/17/2021 2:14 PM] Robert K#0722
So do you know such agencies and have connections to get this process started?

no, but I found this https://www.ceotodaymagazine.com/2019/01/hiring-a-ceo-how-does-it-work/ which resonates with what I wrote, we cannot do it without professional help. And the first step mentioned in the article is to understand and describe what we actually need.

[02/17/2021 2:56 PM] Robert K#0722
The problem is finding a blockchain CEO who isn't a scammy liar or actually knows something and doesn't just say useless platitudes & directs everything in a terrible direction because he has no idea how any of this works, thereby end up making everything 25x worse


[02/17/2021 2:58 PM] Robert K#0722
For most blockchain projects the CEO is effectively just a public talking head, better management is probably more of a needed addition currently, and a lot easier of a position to fill


[02/17/2021 3:28 PM] morphic#4133
I think we are under pressure of unfortunately bad experience with someone who found Ergo and sold himself to Ergo team. 
Based on the problems we need to solve it looks like we actually need a CEO who will organise everything: legal entity, hiring process, funds accounting, weekly operations, monthly planning, progress tracking etc. 
His main role is to transform money into resolution of tasks. It doesn't mean he should be able to do all this, but he will be the main driver of this. 
He/she should also be flexible enough to manage and plan work of me and kushti and other payed EF members (even push if necessary) to make current working plans a reality.
EF on the other hand should be ready to pay market price for such services. 
Until EF solves this key problem it will remain a "Department of Best Wishes" as kushti wrote, because nobody seems to willing to play this role, and this is completely ok, we need new team member, who is not on the board but "in the field" and "in business operation".


[02/17/2021 3:59 PM] Robert K#0722
I am telling you from personal experience with dealing with 15+ startups, hearing inside talk in the Cardano Foundation and the IOHK, talking with some blockchain people at parties when I use to work in NYC, most CEOs suck in blockchain and don't know very much past surface level of what the project does or how it works.


[02/17/2021 4:00 PM] Robert K#0722
Expecting us to find a CEO who can even understand a good chunk of Ergo and what is possible is going to be an impossible endeavour, let alone be able manage, plan work, and guide development.


[02/17/2021 4:01 PM] Robert K#0722
And the moment you put out an advertisement for "Blockchain CEO" you are going to get the most scummy applicants around


[02/17/2021 4:02 PM] Robert K#0722
Sure if we could find the perfect person who understood everything and we paid full time to lead us to a brighter future that would be great, but it's going to be a complete waste of time.


[02/17/2021 4:04 PM] Robert K#0722
I think the EF is much more likely to fulfill all of these needs by finding a good person to do each of these individual responsibilities and a manager to keep track of it all, rather than handing the keys over to someone who isn't going to understand anything and hope it goes well.


[02/17/2021 4:44 PM] kushti#0978
My experience is very much aligned with @Robert K . I knew Chainlink co-founders , first Cardano Foundation chair (he also opened first commercial bank in Dubai and did some business with coal tycoons in Kemerovo, Russia, back in 1993 lol), Waves top guys (public and not so) etc. From what I've seen, it would be hard to find even moderately shady guy (like John Matonis who lead Bitcoin Foundation). 

However, what @morphic describes sounds more like project manager, not CEO exactly (so controlling ops only, no vision etc). But such guys are not capable about transforming money into tasks being done, someone (i.e.CEO) needs to plan things overall.

There are a lot of other issues like how non-profit foundation can coexist with commercial entity, what could be a business model for the  commercial entity (just milking the Foundation?), is commercial entity needed at all etc


[02/17/2021 9:03 PM] morphic#4133
I don't have that much experience with CEOs, so what I really mean is the role of team manager (or administrator) probably


[02/18/2021 6:18 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Rohan has already informally been given the role of secretary in Ergonauts Telegram channel on 7 Feb.:
‚Äúto organize trello, calls and other means of coordination‚Äù;
‚ÄúAnd also connect incoming requests with proper people‚Äù;
‚ÄúThere is 3 months trial‚Äù.

Seems it was not defined secretary of what precisely. He could be considered Ergo Foundation secretary (I think not the best choice), Ergo secretary (too vague I think) or Ergonauts Secretary (sounds like a winner to me) or (other?).

Since Rohan is already acting as Secretary, I suggest we define the role of Secretary more clearly with more responsibilities (I could write up a draft and then post here for review) and then 1) ask him if is willing to do it, and if yes then 2) let him do it and we monitor his results.


[02/18/2021 6:20 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Does anyone have Rohan's resume or CV?


[02/18/2021 7:00 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
@kushti So it seems that you are working X different job positions and reporting to the ‚Äúboss‚Äù, who in this case is also you.

I think that in your role as "kushti's boss" you need to:

1.   break up all of your work into different Job Descriptions. Obviously you know better but for example.‚Ä¶
R&D
Answer questions in Ergo Telegram Channel;
Answer questions in Ergo Mining Telegram Channel;
Etc., etc.

Probably better to make the Job Descriptions as granular as you can. For example, ‚ÄúAnswer questions in all Ergo Telegram Channels‚Äù might be more difficult for someone to agree to than just ‚ÄúAnswer questions in Ergo Mining Telegram Channel‚Äù. Of course it would still leave the option for one person to do multiple Job Descriptions.

2.  For the Job Descriptions that you will not be doing yourself, think of who is qualified or who might be, if anyone (assuming that for most or all jobs it will make sense to try to use people you already know). Then ask that person (or the first person on the list) if he wants to do it. If they don‚Äôt want to do it, ask the second qualified person, or if no 2nd person then tell the first person it could be a paid salary position (or depending on the Job Description, the first time you ask them you might tell them it will be a paid position). Don‚Äôt promise them the job or the salary but you work out a proposal (specific job duties and salary) with the person and then you present this to the EF for a vote.

If no-one is qualified, think of who you might be able to train into the role (could be any programmers you know, Magnum guys, Ergonauts etc.)

Or for some jobs you might delegate the above to someone, but anyhow even in this case it would be up to you to delegate it. I don't think that anyone else can do this for you. You have to do it.


[02/18/2021 7:31 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Have to 1) identify qualified person/people and then 2) ask them directly if they are willing to do specific jobs. Can't just say what needs to be done and hope volunteers emerge.


[02/18/2021 7:37 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti I also think you have been doing too much and its too bad you have had to do the tech support and deal with minor issues with exchanges. I have been wondering if you can 1) reassign an existing developer to take responsibility for these tasks or 2) hire someone to take the lead on these and maybe do some other stuff. I certainly think it would be a good use of funds from the Foundation to reduce this excess work load on you and allow you to focus on other things.


[02/18/2021 7:43 AM] Justin1000#9555
Its basically volunteers. Thats good but it has become evident that if need consistent work and someone to be accountable for certain things, a full-time like position with material compensation is needed. Stating obvious but the huge problem with the Foundation has always been it never has had much funds to disburse which is the whole point of the Foundation in the fist place. Ergo is severely underfunded relative to other much much less promising platforms in the industry. We desperately need a higher ERG price so we can finally solve these problems and hire some people. Recently had a big improvement and climbed the rankings but $2 doesn't cut it. Hopefully we can get above $10 soon and sell ERGs gradually to raise $1mm USDT to use to pay salaries for full time people and other costs. So in short, we need to be laser focused on getting the price up especially in the bull market and post the hard fork, stable coin launch etc. So if you can get any help from big name external parties like Charles, Sasha etc now is the time!


[02/18/2021 7:46 AM] Justin1000#9555
Also, hopefully new apps coming out like the stable coin or whatever give a small amount of fee to the Foundation. I was hoping Foundation would become irrelevant soon but that is apparently not going to happen. The current realities of the industry demand a centralized point at least for some time so good if these guys making new apps has enough confidence in the foundation to give some amount of fees as the block reward is going to fall away soon.


[02/18/2021 7:48 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah I thought it was possible but afraid it might not be practical in the short-term because of time needed. Related to other problems we have of manpower/funding deficit. But I do think DAO would be ideal if could be done and would be compatible with our decentralized ethos.


[02/18/2021 9:21 AM] Justin1000#9555
Oh yeah...we can just raise sigmaUSD and forget about USDT...that will be great üòÄ.  Also if we got some visibility into fee revenue from dapps we could be more aggressive with foundation spending at a lower cost below $10.


[02/18/2021 9:51 AM] mhs_sam#1471
on legal entity, I think we have at least two options: 1) having a legal entity that manages Ergo 2) a legal entity that helps ergo. 
I guess the managing one is hard to deal with at this moment, also can brings some harms and burdens to development, since we have SigamUSD, mixer, which the entity would be somehow responsible for them at some points.
The better option I guess is the second one. We can start with a very small entity dedicated to marketing, R&D, and/or support (any combination of smaller tasks). So it is an entity completely independent and irresponsible or ERGO development, but can do any legal work we need at this point for a while.
the entity can be donated by Treasury, or we can do a partnership deal. It can buy or sell ERG at the markets or even do OTC. Almost all marketing and support tasks can be done in this entity as well. Fining a marketing CEO or whatever is likely much easier and the legal responsibilities of such entity is minimum. also, it can be a for profit entity while the foundation remains non-profit. this way, we can benefit from using either of profit and non-profit entities in each jurisdiction. also, this kind of entities can be replicated around the world and we can have more of them if required.

Hello, my name is John Patrick Acquaviva.

A couple of followers on my discord have mentioned your project, I checked you guys out and like what I see and I think there's a lot of overlap with my audience. I have worked with projects like Uphold, Brave, http://bitcoin.com/, Shapeshift, Algorand, etc and wanted to know if you would be interested in a promo video posted on all my social media accounts?

My social media channels are:
http://facebook.com/AcquavivaFS 200 thousand followers
https://twitter.com/JPAFS 170 thousand followers
https://youtube.com/channel/UCuTIiHyNqELu6RNtB4AahAA 195k subscribers 
https://youtube.com/user/AcquavivaOfficial 40k subscribers

The cost would be $5000, this would include a full 10-15 minute review for my lifestyle and cryptocurrency youtube channel, posts on my twitter accounts, and posts on my facebook pages and a 1 minute sponsored ad in my next video on my political channel 

You can contact me on any of my social media accounts to verify I am who I say I am.

And especially now when we are in a more of an up-tick I don't see the real benefit.


[02/22/2021 9:42 AM] kushti#0978
So my guys are asking for 1 BTC for Ledger + Trezor, to be done in 90 days.


[02/22/2021 9:46 AM] Robert K#0722
Hmm interesting.


[02/22/2021 9:46 AM] Robert K#0722
I'm having a call with them in a few hours, I'll ask how much it would cost to do Trezor as well so we can compare.


[02/22/2021 9:50 AM] kushti#0978
ok please keep us updated!


[02/22/2021 11:53 AM] Robert K#0722
But wait @kushti, as I mentioned a couple months ago Marek told me trezor won't support us even if we do all the dev work unless we're a top 50 coin


[02/22/2021 11:53 AM] Robert K#0722
And Marek knows because he used to work there


[02/22/2021 11:54 AM] Robert K#0722
And they've already closed PRs for coins which were too small who already did all the implementation work


[02/22/2021 12:44 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah, that is what I thought too regarding Trezor. I think the top priorities are 1) getting on ONE HW wallet and 2) getting done as soon as possible. Trezor specifically a far secondary concern - probably we should tackle it later after ledger and a lot of price appreciation. Blockstack was onTrezor but they are a mess now and moved everything over to Ledger. Probably is only good for top 20 or 30 coins...but I dunno


[02/22/2021 12:44 PM] Justin1000#9555
Also don't think the price difference between $20k and $50k is even that important as we really need a HW wallet. Just find the best guys who can do it the quickest most reliably.


[02/22/2021 12:54 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Well the contests can be a good idea but that is not what I am talking about here. What I am trying to do is find CT writers to write articles "So we can get there [CT] for free by providing some valuable content which is not selling Ergo too much". Tech related articles would work well. For example, Antonio (or other writer) could write an article on oracle pools (with mentioning Ergo).


[02/22/2021 1:24 PM] Robert K#0722
So I had the call with my guys and they'll be needing a 1 month run up to allocate resources, so realistically from our vote it'd probably take 130ish days for them to deliver ledger support.


[02/22/2021 1:25 PM] Robert K#0722
@kushti I think if you can convince your guys to just do Ledger support (skip Trezor), I imagine they can get that done in 30-60 days compared to their original estimate and for around half price, right?


[02/22/2021 1:26 PM] Robert K#0722
And if so they're probably the better option between the two.


[02/23/2021 12:20 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
As I understand, Antonio is writing a piece on Ethereum vs Ergo that will be published on Medium. It would be too much Ergo to be approved by the editors of CT etc.  But, Antonio could write a second edited version that could likely get approved by the CT editors and published on CT as an expert piece (with quotes from @Robert K and or @kushti) or technical article. And that is how we get "stealth" Ergo articles published on CT, etc. without having to pay CT (maybe send some Ergs to Antonio). I will also try to find more writers in addition to Antonio.

[02/23/2021 12:28 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Also we can likely get more articles published if we have more "experts" who are willing to do interviews or provide quotes on topics related to Ergo. For example, a CT writer could do an article on some other topic that relates to Ergo and quote Sasha and get it published on CT as an expert/tech article.


[02/23/2021 12:30 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
CT etc. editors love "expert" interviews  and quotes. So Stealth Ergo stories are more likely to get published on CT etc. if have quotes from an "expert".

After the fiasco with Jason, almost good to get both working independently but we don't have the money to throw around like that. Once we got a team and a timing we can announce to community so they know resolution is on the horizon.

My guys are good, but they are kind of annoying at the same time.


[02/26/2021 9:18 AM] Robert K#0722
They really really really would prefer to be paid in fiat, and we don't have a real method for making that happen currently.


[02/26/2021 9:18 AM] Robert K#0722
And they need a 1 month run-up before they even begin the project.


[02/26/2021 9:19 AM] Robert K#0722
So even if we have to pay for both ledger/trezor for $50k, if they accept USDT or whatever crypto method and can get started ASAP, then it's probably just a better option


[02/26/2021 4:08 PM] Robert K#0722

@deleted-role should EF print some SigUSD to stop the whale attacking it ?


[02/28/2021 12:22 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I don't know since I dont know.... could an attack be fatal? and if is yes, what is the likelyhood (or how much $ would the attacker need to deploy?


[02/28/2021 12:29 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
If attack can be fatal and EF defends by printing SigUSD, maybe it is a super whale and he counter attacks and crushes the defense and thereby not only only fatal result but also wipe out of EF funds. I am too ignorant regarding this, so I cannot form an opinion now on whether or not EF should start to defend.


[02/28/2021 5:29 PM] mx#5165
@Robert K please ask if they accept USDT or other crypto and submit a proposal on the forum if they agree, when you have some time this week


[02/28/2021 7:54 PM] kushti#0978
well, attacks exhausted to the moment it seems


[02/28/2021 7:54 PM] kushti#0978

[03/01/2021 12:57 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Ok, I understand more clearly now anyhow.


[03/01/2021 10:09 AM] Robert K#0722
@mx Asking for them to confirm if they are fine with USDT or whatever crypto they prefer, and once they confirm I'll post the proposal


[03/01/2021 10:10 AM] Robert K#0722
If the EF prints some SigUSD, there really isn't a "counter-attack" unless the whale drives up the price, which would benefit the ecosystem, but mean that we at the EF have fewer funds to use.


[03/01/2021 10:11 AM] Robert K#0722
But yeah, this is just how it works with whales + DeFi with oracles + low market cap


[03/01/2021 10:11 AM] Robert K#0722
I hope the whales aren't stupid enough to keep doing this to the point where people freak out and the price dumps


[03/02/2021 7:31 PM] kushti#0978
I am going to propose SigUSD as an alternative payment option to guys getting ERG


[03/02/2021 7:32 PM] kushti#0978
As it seems biz/ops side is still not good, let's try to put someone new in that?


[03/02/2021 7:32 PM] kushti#0978
How about Maximillian?


[03/02/2021 9:45 PM] kushti#0978
@Robert K can we delegate talks with your guys about Ledger to someone ? I guess you're overbusy these days


[03/02/2021 10:56 PM] Robert K#0722
Ah thanks, but I've known these guys for a couple years and they'd be offended if I delegated it to someone else. It's not a big deal I can manage it.


[03/02/2021 10:58 PM] Robert K#0722
They also asked if we can have some sort of formal documentation of them being awarded the grant so it is easier for them to file taxes next year, and I told them to just create a formal grant proposal to send to us, and we can send a format "grant acceptance letter" back where we specify exactly how much the grant is for so it's clear and simple.


[03/02/2021 11:02 PM] kushti#0978
Sounds good


[03/03/2021 12:45 AM] Justin1000#9555
What would qualify him for it and why would he be interested and motivated? My experience with him is limited to just the below:
*Hearing of him for many months from @kushti and how he has good knowledge, connections in Asia etc but then never saw anything come from any of it
*One call with him for Ergonauts, nothing more than a short chat with him - he did indeed seem to have some knowledge
*Sent him the stuff he asked for on OKEx but haven't heard back any feedback yet. He might be good but from my very limited interaction with him, its just not obvious.


[03/03/2021 3:08 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I think it would be better to recruit openly from the Ergo community. Announce in Twitter and Telegram and then we pick the best from a pool of candidates.
Also I think we need the role and the specific duties clearly defined (not sure whether you mean replacing Rohan or something else).


[03/03/2021 3:09 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Maybe Maximillian gets the job anyhow.


[03/03/2021 5:16 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
@mx I could not find @rootzolo user in Telegram. Can you forward that email to me noah.hudson@protonmail.com and I will follow up with him (with cc)?


[03/03/2021 5:17 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
He might be a good candidate for Ergonauts Coordinator (Rohan is failing in his role as coordinator in my opinion).


[03/03/2021 5:44 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
If we decide to  recruit for a new coordinator, I can take responsibility for recruiting unless someone else wants to. I would cc Ergo email on all email communications.
I think we should have a dedicated and competent coordinator.
I don't think we need a dedicated general Business Development (forming cooperations with outside parties) role. Anyone who can help with business development can form proposals and submit to Ergo. No need for a special role for them. I suppose it might make sense if we wanted to have very focused Business Development roles,for example if we wanted specifically to make cooperation with crypto media platforms, we could try to recruit someone for that specifically.


[03/03/2021 8:00 AM] Justin1000#9555
For potential serious roles working for the Foundation, we can't just go the community. That is for stuff like writing blogs, community organizer, lower level less sensitive jobs.


[03/03/2021 8:01 AM] Justin1000#9555
For serious Foundation roles, need to be targeted so get the exact position, the requirements and go out to people we know already first and then maybe broader or use a head hunter.


[03/03/2021 8:04 AM] Justin1000#9555
I know a lot of people from traditional finance etc for example, might make sense to approach for some roles down the road. One of my friends was CFO for a Japanese fashion list co, then became CFO of Shanghai Tang another famous fashion Company in HK-China. Now at another huge fashion company. He was previously at PWC. I already mentioned 6 months ago maybe someday he could possibly be CEO/CFO or something of the Foundation. He doesn't know too much about blockchain though but is totally trust worthy, ethical and very experienced with accounting and pristine reputation which does huge things for getting licenses, bank accounts, good lawyers etc. Those are the type of people need in major Foundation roles. Crypto expertise could be secondary perhaps cuz we already know so much ourselves. As long as they are able to learn...


[03/03/2021 8:08 AM] Justin1000#9555
I have exchanged some emails with Harneys, my BVI Lawyers. BVI probably not suitable for a legal entity. They actually got a partner in Caymans who is quite positive on Caymans but some VASP stuff now days. Apparently they did Dash's Foundation. They don't practice too much in Switzerland/Dubai. Anyway I will go through what they sent over and do some initial research. Initially thinking either Dubai, Switzerland, Caymans, DAO with no legal entity but other companies set up wherever to be employed by the DAO.


[03/03/2021 8:09 AM] Justin1000#9555
DAO is my preference but not sure @kushti and team have time to do that in short-term. Bigger priority in my opinion this year is getting the DEX done and done good and soon...

I think Rohan will act as kind of secretary for me and Ergonauts, he is will also do tech support oversight (pinging appropriate devs when problems reported). 

We also need some biz/ops-dev guy I suppose who will coordinate legal stuff, talking with exchanges, funds, establish partnerships, and so on. 

On top of that we can have CEO eventually.


[03/03/2021 8:38 AM] kushti#0978
Also, market making , collecting funds etc


[03/03/2021 8:38 AM] kushti#0978

[03/03/2021 9:05 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
@kushti  I am confused now about Rohan, is he doing two "jobs"?
1. Secretary for you and tech support (I don't know since I have no visibility if maybe you are assigning him tasks by PM one on one), and;
2. Ergonauts Coordinator, whose duties are:
-Manage and keep up to date Ergo Trello
-Manage and keep up to date Ergo Team Roles spreadsheet
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JeTIh9dKHLtJmR5y1wdzxrZ5Rp4PYvRIVPqtozVY0l8/edit#gid=0
-Schedule and host Ergonauts Zoom Meeting
-Make sure that all tasks proposed in Ergonauts are added to Trello. Remind people when they fail to meet a deadline.

I think Rohan is doing a lousy job as Ergonauts Coordinator as demonstrated in our chat group here https://t.me/joinchat/PqT7XN3Y62swODBl. 
I think we should get someone new as Ergonauts Coordinator. And then if you like Rohan as your secretary and tech support of course keep him at that?

[03/03/2021 9:08 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I think it makes sense for you to have a personal secretary and a different person as Ergonauts Coordinator. Can get messy if same person does both.


[03/03/2021 9:28 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Agree with @Justin1000  "For serious Foundation roles, need to be targeted so get the exact position, the requirements and go out to people we know already first and then maybe broader or use a head hunter."


[03/03/2021 9:29 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Public call for someone like Rohan but not for a major role.


[03/03/2021 10:28 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
In summary, it seems to me we need 3 people:
1. Ergonauts Coordinator. Needed now. Recruit someone new by public call; 
2. Kushti personal secretary. Needed now. Use Rohan or recruit new person;
3. Serious role(s) (biz dev, CFO and or CEO), can wait and not needed now. Recruit later first via @Justin1000  and other networking, and then if needed use professional head hunter.


[03/03/2021 10:29 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Does that sound right?


[03/03/2021 11:21 AM] kushti#0978
Yes, about right


[03/03/2021 11:21 AM] kushti#0978
Other guys in Ergonauts not better than Rohan


[03/03/2021 11:22 AM] kushti#0978
I think the problem often is that guys in Ergonauts do not know how to form small groups to solve problems


[03/03/2021 11:23 AM] kushti#0978
Thus they're coming to me or Robert or whoever tries to be active


[03/03/2021 11:23 AM] kushti#0978
So being active becomes a curse eventually as people are asking about anything


[03/03/2021 11:23 AM] kushti#0978
The table with roles Rohan started etc is a good first step


[03/03/2021 11:42 AM] kushti#0978
We can put Maximilian or other guy at one or two particular tasks for starters and see how it goes


[03/03/2021 1:46 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
The roles table was my idea, I asked Rohan to make it in the last Zoom call. Seems like a very basic and obvious thing that we need.  He made a version but I did not like it so I re did it into the current version. Basically most or at least many things he has done in Ergonauts the past week or two has been at my specific instruction to him in the "Coordinator Ergonauts" group we are all in (so you can all see). Have reminded him a second time in some cases. I even dictated exact messages for him to send to specific people in Ergonauts group (no PM'ing so it is all open).   So basically a lot or most of what "he has done" in Ergonauts the past week+ was actually done by me. And many more things that seem obvious that he should do but has not I have not even bothered to point out to him. He shows very little initiative and is not suitable for this role, in my view. 

Seems clear to me how to get Ergonauts organized and coordinated and running smoothly, I could do it myself but I am not willing to take on this role.

So unless any of you have  doubts, hesitations or objections to raise, I think I should take lead on recruiting for a new Ergonauts Coordinator. I would also set up a Telegram group with us and the new coordinator to "coach" and monitor him/her at the beginning like I have been doing with Rohan.


[03/03/2021 1:49 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Next step I think would be that in the Coordinator Ergonauts group with him, I tell him that we think it is not working out and so ask him to finish out this month as his last month as Coordinator. Then he can graciously announce in Ergonauts that he is moving on to other things (resigning) instead that we fire.


[03/03/2021 1:53 PM] kushti#0978
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ ok, we need to look for a new coordinator in private then ?


[03/03/2021 1:57 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Hard to do in private.
Problematic if we surprise Rohan and Ergonauts if we suddenly announce on Ergo Twitter that we are looking for a new Ergonauts Coordinator.
So I propose we first "encourage" Rohan for him to announce his resignation in Ergonauts Group (he can stay on till end of the month if he wants).
Then after he announces in Ergonauts group we thank him for his service in Ergonauts group. Then we can recruit new Ergonauts Coordinator publicly.
I think he owns our Ergo Trello but I took screenshots today so I think not hard to reproduce if he hijacks it.


[03/03/2021 1:57 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
That's what I'm thinking. Any other ideas or something I might have failed to consider?


[03/03/2021 2:21 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Or we talk to this guy first, maybe he would be good as new Coordinator. I can reply to him if @mx  can forward the email to me.


[03/03/2021 2:39 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
On 2nd thought, yes maybe better to first try to do in private. Maybe one of us can find someone.

We sent out article yesterday through Jinse on "what Ergo brings to Cardano"...>70k views last I looked. They help push them to the top to help insure we get maximum exposure. However, we sent another article today on the stable coin and they don't want to push any articles for now because the National People's Congress just started. So note that we will have a bit of a media black out in China for at least a few days...maybe week or slightly longer...gotta wait till Jinse is ready again. But in mean time, Eva will be doing other things and getting future articles ready (think we already got 2...) and she is saying we need to do some specific things targeting miners like AMA or broadcasts. Also will look to get Jinse active journalist coverage but that again will have to wait till after the National People's Congress stuff calms down.

1. "As such, all SigmaUSD holders can redeem their tokens immediately, which will also allow all SigmaRSV holders to redeem their tokens as well."
This could be emphasized more; easy to overlook at the end of a paragraph. Lots of people in Telegram confused and worried that maybe their funds are gone.
2. "The current plan is to launch the new oracle pool update within the next week"
Maybe deleting "update" will make it more clear since its a new oracle pool.

@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ so we had both Orhan and Rohan today ? Is Orhan going to be a coordinator ?


[03/10/2021 12:56 PM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Maybe. First I just invited Orhan into Ergonauts with no role. I'll give him nothing to do at first, let him just get familiar. Then I will probably start to just ask him to "help" with things in organizing Trello and coordination and see how he does.  I guess if he is good he will gradually take over for Rohan within 2 months. I will be monitoring.


[03/11/2021 2:07 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Seems we could use more Ergo original content writers and even a "articles team manager" to organize them. Never heard back from Jordan at CT so I just cold LinkedIn messaged 17 CT writers, including some editors.

For reference, I came across this add from Komodo, offering $1000-$1500 USD / Month for a part-time freelance writer.

[03/11/2021 2:52 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I'm chatting with Orhan (the 3rd place article contest winner just added to Ergonauts yesterday) in Telegram. He says he can do articles (for Ergo Blog and blockfolio.com) for us, asking for maybe "15-25 erg per content" but also willing to prove himself first. Also sounds like a good way to start, pay him by article and see how he is rather than a fixed amount per month. Let's offer him US$50 per article (paid in ERG) on trial basis for one month? What do you guys think?


[03/11/2021 2:57 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Maybe he does 15 articles per month x $50 = $750


[03/11/2021 2:58 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
And also hopefully he can take over as coordinator (I'll monitor him)

[03/11/2021 3:00 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Or maybe start at just $30 per article and then if he is decent after a month or so can raise to $50?


[03/11/2021 3:18 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Maybe in general we should try to limit writers to around 4 articles per month; quality might go down if one person is doing more than that. If aiming for more articles, just get more writers.

[03/11/2021 7:27 PM] kushti#0978
Just found now pretty old proposal from Jason Davies on vulnerability disclosure funding:
"
Something like:
- high severity: $10k
- medium severity: $5k
- low severity: $2k"


[03/12/2021 6:43 AM] Justin1000#9555
What are you trying to say? That this Jason Davies guy may have found some vulnerabilities we need to address and pay him? Or that we should announce bounties to the world and maybe go with these numbers? Seem a bit on high-end to me and prefer low $ in light of our continued constrained funding. But really I cant comment much on this so defer to you.


[03/12/2021 6:44 AM] Justin1000#9555
Not sure if worth considering a more detailed audit by Jean Philippe Aumasson or at a least more detailed write-up at some point.


[03/12/2021 7:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
***Apparently tomorrow can resume the Jinse articles. Might provide a price boost over next few days or at least hopefully some price support! But most important thing is going to be having a smooth roll-out of Sigma USD this time.


[03/12/2021 8:45 AM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 Jason Davies proposed to have a single framework to pay for vulnerabilities found. For ErgoMixer issues reported, I paid him from my personal ergs with no any principle in mind.


[03/12/2021 8:46 AM] kushti#0978
Having a single framework would be good, even if "severity" can be subjective sometimes.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/shiraz-jagati-23274619a/
https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-at-a-crossroads-ether-community-turmoil-over-miner-reward-fees

Seems he is totally unfamiliar with Ergo but he wants to try writing for our blog and see where it leads. His rate is USD0.12 per word which seems reasonable to me (I would just pay him out of my Ergs at the beginning). I think we should give him a try so I'll add him to Ergonauts Telegram if there are no objections.

Found a guy who did Ledger integration for Waves (tolsi, @mx knows him likely). He's free now and can do integration, Asking for an interaction with frontend devs.


[03/19/2021 9:07 PM] kushti#0978
Got grant proposal as well, will submit it to here later.

On core development, hopefully, @pragmaxim will join. Then we have 2-3 devs working with me on the node, so hopefully I will do just some critical things there (like improving p2p layer which is kinda Achiless Heel now I suppose) and mostly reviewing code done by others. 

I suggest to polish and finish what is started with other parts of codebase started or sponsored by EF / core members, namely:

* continue support for ergo-lib(sigma-rust), think how can we get ErgoScript improvements
* continue support for offchain tools, such as AppKit and HDF. AppKit should target for Java Virtual Machine, so no need for Graal VM there. Maybe it is worth to have a list of features to support (for both).
* more example apps on top of AK / HDF, more examples in ErgoScript by the Example, dapp templates like ergo-js by anon-real.

So I guess we should hire a Rust dev (to support codebase in Rust and help @greenhat), would be also good to find a Scala dev to help @morphic with Sigma. 

I also propose to organize a virtual hackathon. We can have some specific topics to propose (crowdfunding app, more multisig clients etc), also welcoming contributions in other areas.  We can put Angie here maybe (as a trial task).


[03/20/2021 10:33 AM] kushti#0978
Lemme publish a bit edited version of this


[03/21/2021 8:05 PM] mx#5165
he was solid and rather fast in the past


[03/21/2021 8:11 PM] mx#5165
he did leasing for Waves, mostly responsible for different integrations next


[03/22/2021 8:50 AM] morphic#4133
"AppKit should target for Java Virtual Machine, so no need for Graal VM there" There is nothing GraalVM specific in Appkit as GraalVM is a drop-in replacement for OpenJDK JVM. Also, I suggest to continue supporting both Scala 2.11 and Scala 2.12 because it doesn't involve any additional overhead.  
Scala 2.11 support was easy and almost free way to allow Appkit/Sigma to run on Android. There was some initial interest in this so I created this PoC project https://github.com/aslesarenko/ergo-android. 
Let's keep the existing capabilities at least for the time being, because as new people are joining development they might be interested.


[03/22/2021 9:09 AM] kushti#0978
Currently he's retired and trying to find a new himself it seems )


[03/22/2021 9:21 AM] mx#5165
he is good at reimplementing different solutions in scala, problems solver, cracking hackathons


[03/22/2021 9:21 AM] morphic#4133
"to find a Scala dev to help @morphic with Sigma." 
I think it is better to find someone who will be able to take full ownership of Sigma.
After v5.0 soft-fork I plan to remove all AOT based code and do other codebase simplification in a series of v5.x releases. Also v5.0 is a good candidate for full documentation because, hopefully, it will have sound implementation which can be documented.
However this work is more or less independent of many new requested features which can be done as part of v6.x. I think this is a good time for someone to join Sigma development and focus on new staff, rather than dealing with issues in the existing code.


[03/22/2021 2:13 PM] kushti#0978
Going to meet Angie in 2 hours


[03/22/2021 10:24 PM] kushti#0978
So let's proceed with Angie. She lead a team of 5 in CT, and at least knows  much more than me about marketing stuff. 
She's asking for 1500 EUR for starters, can pay from my ergs during some trial (2-3 months?). 

I am going to put her into structuring everything we have done to the moment, to free my head from that, so partnerships, channels, ergonauts actively contributing, local moderators, bloggers, journalists and media we did work and working with etc. She will spend this week on that. With that we can start planning new campaigns then. 

I guess even proper structuring will do a lot with no extra resources being spent.

@Robert K is it possible to have a SigmaRSV calculator/simulator? in which any one can calculate the gains/losses by changing some parameters and assumptions.


[03/30/2021 4:48 PM] Robert K#0722
@mhs_sam Yes it shouldn't be theoretically too hard to do that I believe, just not the most straightforward


[03/30/2021 4:49 PM] Robert K#0722
If you look at this file in the headless dApp, it has all the calculations exposed as methods (all are WASM compatible in JS), but you simply need to provide a UTXO with the bank state that you would want to simulate: https://github.com/Emurgo/age-usd/blob/main/ageusd-headless/src/bank.rs#L27-L29

[03/30/2021 4:51 PM] Robert K#0722
So if you create a fake UTXO with the correct registers/tokens that you want as the state at that point, you can then create a `BankBox` struct, and have all of the methods automatically calculate the current rc/sc price (well if you provide the oracle box too, but that can be fetched automatically for you), reserve ratio, how many sc/rc can be minted, etc.


[03/30/2021 4:52 PM] Robert K#0722
You'd have to create a fake oracle box to simulate different oracle prices too.

on Ledger: 

"1. Can you start immediately?
- Almost, we can start early next month. Meanwhile, we can do all the legal procedures if there are any required.
2. Do you have any milestones in mind? Can we pay per milestone? How much upfront?
- Best for us is if we could split into three equal payments: 1st - upfront, 2nd - upon completion of milestones 1 and 2, and the 3rd upon final delivery. Would this work for you?
3. Do we need to pay the total amount in USDT or can it be partially paid in ERG?
- Well, ideally we would prefer plain old USD if possible. If not - USDT can work. As for the ERG token - not yet ready for that. We hope, though, that it's just the first project we do with Ergo Foundation and we could reconsider it in the future.
4. When can we have an announcement?
- As soon as possible, I guess üôÇ We'd love to do an announcement from our side as well. How do you do the marketing with the grantees in general? Can we add your logo to our website? Do you do any kind of promotion?

We are ready and eager to move this forward."

In regards to ledger, looks like they're effectively ready to build just with the upfront delay, and everything besides that looks good to me.


[04/07/2021 6:21 PM] Robert K#0722
In similar note to @mx , I think it might also be best for me to be officially off as well. I haven't been doing anything in the past month so I didn't take Ergs for it, and I have a few too many overblown situations especially at work these days (and further personal responsibilities added on top) that I'm not really able to manage everything that is going on currently.


[04/07/2021 6:22 PM] Robert K#0722
Might be best to invite more new blood who are excited about Ergo and have the time to take on responsibilities and further provide more value to the ecosystem.


[04/08/2021 4:25 PM] mhs_sam#1471
So you wanna officially exit the EF?
I'm sure you have solid reasons and exhausted by lots of works, but personally I do not thinks it is a good decision to make right now.
It is completely okay, I think, If you want some time off, but exiting the EF after @mx and the community misunderstanding happened with Savo will result in very bad situation for Ergo.
You are one of the bests in this area and your presence in EF is very promising.
anyway, we can add new blood, in the lower levels and keep the EF as it is for a while. So I friendly suggest to be in EF and take your time being off for a while.

The way I see it, the main duty of being a good EF board member is to 1) be knowledgeable enough of what's going on to make informed and competent decisions when voting on EF proposals; and 2) have the best interest of Ergo's long term success at heart when voting on proposals. Just this is actually very valuable since good people are hard to find, especially in crypto.
Anything beyond that is optional, such as development,  community involvement, marketing and other activities.

so he is proposing the support of Ergo DEX. I don't know what he wants in return.
so I suggested that someone like Armeanio be in contact with him. 
actually, I do not know what to respond.


[04/23/2021 10:58 PM] mhs_sam#1471
My repsonse:
"Hi Jason, sorry for late response. As impersonating is common and easy in discord, I wanted to know that is actually you. Thanks for quick response and reaching out.
It would be my pleasure to be in contact with you and have support of ErgoDex on your side. 
Please let me know if you have any business opportunities and joint work. Also, I will have someone more available from the marketing and business team to be in contact with you."


[05/17/2021 10:23 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I think it's time we get our Content Team sorted out.

Reference to Angie‚Äôs Content Creation post:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XyJ1Jk9GQPcYSoQYyDHFJG3J2UGrB_WfWHcWH0lSDHA/edit

As far as I know for current writers (bloggers/copywriters) we have:
1. Orhan.  Not technical savvy, not that great a writer, not a published writer other than for us.
2. KPTX.  He did a great article but does not seem very active (I think he is doing some editing behind the scenes). Would be good I think if he can be writing more. He is not getting compensated at all as far as I know.
3. Glasgow. Great writer but already super busy with Reddit and social media, not a dedicated writer.
4. Armeanio. Same story as Glasgow, would be a great regular writer but already super busy with biz-dev and social media, not a dedicated writer.

So we might start with bringing in 4-6 people:

I. 1x Content Creator/ Editor. 
Chatting with Angie in Telegram she told me "I have an editor of news from Cointelegraph, he can make good content plan, edit texts and run a pipeline like it should be, he wants 25$ an hour but make it part time. I‚Äôm sure he can be good even spending three- four hours a day for it"

II. 1x SEO specialists.

III. 2x or 3x bloggers/copywriters.
Not sure but I guess these guys would be paid per word.

Very important, the bloggers/copywriters should be technically savvy so they can understand Ergo and write technically advanced and accurate writeups. Kushti does great short posts on the forum for topics that need multiple pages, so we need more TECHNICALLY SAVVY writers. 
Maybe Angie can get KPTX to do more here.

The team makeup would need to be fine tuned with Angie. But I think we are ready now to talk with Angie and get our Content Team sorted out. Also need to confirm with Angie if she can be in charge of all of this, the recruiting and overseeing the Content Team.

What do you all think?

[05/17/2021 10:28 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
We could ask Angie to put together a proposal for our Content Team .


[05/17/2021 12:37 PM] Justin1000#9555
My inclination would be for the Foundation to fund hiring who she thinks we need. But review their work after a couple months and if they are not suitable then probably should not keep them. But we shoudn't be too afraid of spending a little money right now in my view.


[05/17/2021 6:40 PM] mhs_sam#1471
I'm agree with that and what @Justin1000 says is reasonable. also, we need a good designer (Angie suggested that too).


[05/17/2021 9:14 PM] morphic#4133
I also agree with @Justin1000. 
You also mentioned the short posts from Kushti. This is very good point. When reading those posts I feel like the information and ideas are very compressed, every word counts. This is understandably economic for the writer, but hard for the reader, I never get it from the first read (sometimes even from the second). But it would be really valuable, if somebody can expand those posts into easy readable longer texts with examples and step-by-step explanations. And for such kind of work tech-savvyness need to be quite high, but I think we need just one such writer ATM.


[05/18/2021 10:32 AM] Robert K#0722
I agree, this is a good moment to use more money so that things can get snowballing further


[05/18/2021 10:34 AM] mhs_sam#1471
Do we need a sys admin or something like that? for nodes, exchanges and wallet's support. I think Alex is busy with them now.


[05/18/2021 10:45 AM] Robert K#0722
In that vein, I do think it is important now also to hire more people who can actually take work off of Alex's shoulders and writing job descriptions to make that happen rather than just conversing about it.


[05/18/2021 10:49 AM] Robert K#0722
Though I'm not sure if we have anyone who would like to potentially take that up?


[05/18/2021 10:51 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
This from Angie just now in Telegram:

In this case, I want to bring up a new editor for content plan creation and editorial 
His name is Aaron, he is current news editor at Cointelegraph 
He is ready to get on board ASAP 
The only thing is to organize administrative stuff 

His conditions would be as follows:  

a limited part-time basis, no more than like 10 hours a week;
He can consult on a general content strategy, edit content, and write copy/posts. From our discussion the most pressing need for PR right now.

He can't really consult on media relations, as that starts to get into some ethically murky territory for him as an editor, also he cannot make any pitches or announcements to media organizations, especially Cointelegraph, but I‚Äôm taking care of it separately 

25$/ an hour 

My question is if we all are okay with that conditions, I‚Äôd like to start working with him ASAP


[05/18/2021 10:52 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Totally agree. I think Angie can deal with the marketting and community stuff. I'm not qualified to do for the tech side.


[05/18/2021 10:52 AM] Robert K#0722
It seems it'd be good to have:
- Someone to deal with node/wallet support for exchanges
- (Not sure if everyone will agree with this) A general project manager to keep tabs on all of the projects and is able to coordinate everything as needed, and act as a unifying force between content creators/writers & the devs while making it easier to make roadmaps and so forth
- Someone for administrative purposes especially as we approach incorporating (can also function for talking with new partners potentially)

[05/19/2021 7:29 AM] Justin1000#9555
@deleted-role Can everyone read the above carefully and share any thoughts or concerns?


[05/19/2021 7:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
I just had a good call with Dentons for more than 1 hour. I don't see much reason not to make prelim decision to move forward with Singapore as location. 1) fast with 3-4 weeks to set up; 2) many crypto entities there already; 3) seem to have great lawyers already working with Ergo (Dentons); 4) pre-incorporation contracts seems useful; 5) cost probably reasonable and so on. Think the aspects are pretty well covered in the doc


[05/19/2021 7:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
They said the concerns I had with other jurisidictions like Wyoming and Cayman were similar to what they had heard before.


[05/19/2021 7:32 AM] Justin1000#9555
I like Caymans as mentioned as I have good lawyers there and had good experience in BVI with them. But they are saying need to assess Ergo for VASP issues, then if that is okay still need 4-6 weeks to set up and I haven't heard anything like pre-incporporation contracts for Caymans. Probably one advantage of caymans is less tax risk as it is well known tax haven.


[05/19/2021 7:34 AM] Justin1000#9555
Gating issues for Singapore are 1) I think should have another call with tax advisor referred by Dentons to see if any obvious major tax issues; 2) Dentons to confirm but they seem to think we need to get Ownership Attribution document signed by key devs certifying ownership over the treasury belongs to the Foundation legal entity. (this is mentioned in the doc above...)


[05/19/2021 7:35 AM] Justin1000#9555
We could certainly spend more time and talk to more people around the world to get a better feel but I think probably we should just go with Sing in interest of time. Worst case, we can move later.


[05/19/2021 7:38 AM] Justin1000#9555
For convenience, I am happy to pay the initial legal fees with Dentons myself for the setup and be reimbursed in equivalent ERGs when the monthly payments are made. If we decide to proceed with Dentons/Singapore.


[05/19/2021 8:31 AM] morphic#4133
what is the reason for Bank Account limitation "for small expenses and not transfers of 100s of thousands"?


[05/19/2021 8:31 AM] morphic#4133
Otherwise, sounds good.


[05/19/2021 8:43 AM] Justin1000#9555
No reason given but banking is always difficult for crypto companies. Probably this limitation is from his specific experience with this bank they want to refer us to.


[05/19/2021 8:44 AM] Justin1000#9555
I am cautiously optimistic we can get a solid bank account though without this limitation. I got one for my bvi fund after all and know a consultant for this. Good chance we could also just use the same bank I use. They are pretty solid and deal in all currencies.


[05/19/2021 8:49 AM] morphic#4133
Ah, ok, sounds good. We also need to make sure we will be able to pay salaries in USD/EUR via bank transfers.


[05/19/2021 8:57 AM] morphic#4133
The ability to pay legal salary is vitally important for example on Russian IT job market. From my prior experience in Huawei when hiring many employees, when it comes to job offer the "gray" scheme is not the way to go for many good candidates.


[05/19/2021 10:46 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Looks fine to me. Obviously not a must have at this point but maybe they have a "standard template" constitution and by-laws etc. for crypto foundations  that we can review for reference and see some of the fine print and how complicated the entity might be?


[05/19/2021 10:49 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
"Kenneth Lo owns 5% stake in a friends service provider Company. In 2017, they began servicing crypto companies."
I wonder if they can handle regular salary etc. payments? Maybe for example the Foundation would be able to just send them one payment a month all in one shot and then they make the individual salary payments and so on. Would save a lot of time and hassle for us.

Singapore seems like a good idea all in all, as long as the costs don't get out of hand for the EF.


[05/19/2021 11:24 PM] kushti#0978
agree


[05/21/2021 6:57 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti and @mx, what do you guys think on legal entity? @kushti, if you want me to proceed, just reply to the Dentons email chain with ‚ÄúHi Kenneth. We have decided to move forward with the Singapore incorporation of the Foundation legal entity. Please follow instructions from Justin and accept payment from him on behalf of the future Foundation. Thanks‚Äù


[05/21/2021 6:57 AM] Justin1000#9555
The process I anticipate going forward is:


[05/21/2021 6:58 AM] Justin1000#9555
Step 1:
*Talk to Singapore tax advisors with Dentons to understand potential tax implications.
*Contact my bank in Bahamas about prospects of a bank account and see if any issues due to Singapore incorporation.
*Look to get a draft of the attribution of ownership doc for Foundation funds and clarity on who exactly needs to sign it.
*Report back on above here before proceeding to Step 2. 
*There may be some expenses incurred in this step but expect it to be minimal.
*Also will ask Dentons for a quote for full process.


[05/21/2021 6:58 AM] Justin1000#9555
Step 2:
*Get all the incorporation docs and review them and provide comments.
*Put commented docs here for review and comments by anyone else before submitting back to Dentons.
*Probably 1 or 2 rounds of comments. Probably will not be too complicated.
*Appoint 3rd parties referred by Dentons to handle accounting, tax reporting, registered office and Singapore-based Director.
*Proceed in parallel to set up bank account if identify good bank that is willing (no guarantee on this one).
*Proceed to pay all expenses and set up the entity.


[05/21/2021 6:59 AM] Justin1000#9555
Guess will take 4 weeks total. Will drop receipts in the Fund chat for reimbursement when monthly payments are made. Can use whatever ERG:USDT exchange rate is when make payment.


[05/21/2021 6:59 AM] Justin1000#9555
Or if there are serious reservations about Singapore or you have another location you might prefer we can pursue that instead‚Ä¶


[05/21/2021 8:17 AM] mx#5165
receiving protocol rewards ends shortly so maybe just grant the final balance to new entity then, i won`t be part of it so whatever fits its members is fine with me, anon devs will take care of themselves


[05/23/2021 7:40 AM] Justin1000#9555
@mx Too bad you are leaving! You can consider staying on as a Member or its equivalent in whatever jurisdiction we choose if not Singapore instead of a Board Director. Its much more passive role I believe with most important aspect being appointing Directors.


[05/23/2021 7:40 AM] Justin1000#9555
Probably I want to stay on myself as Director (or whatever is same as current capacity) in new entity if possible. We might consider adding 1 or 2 people. Could be someone like Armeanio or Glasgow but I would point out that just because people are contributing hugely in the community, they shouldn‚Äôt necessarily be board members of the Foundation. Actually, seems to me the Foundation Board member is very much a part-time role and mainly about how treasury Funds are disbursed although there is big aspect of strategic planning. Someone working for the Foundation in a full-time or even part-time capacity and making big contributions could have a much higher ‚Äúsalary‚Äù than whatever the Board Member compensation is going to be.


[05/23/2021 7:41 AM] Justin1000#9555
To me, probably the traits generally want in Board Member of Foundation would be:
-Long-term commitment to Ergo and its principals
-Maturity and ability to think long-term and strategically
-Ethical and capable of fulfilling the Fiduciary duty
-Good reputation


[05/23/2021 7:41 AM] Justin1000#9555
Just my thoughts above. @kushti, you may consider offering CH or CFund (if they come in) to appoint a Director although I think they should fulfil the above requirements. Also, probably both CH/CFund should not be able to appoint more than 1 combined. Another consideration to appointing new people right now is that Funds, partners or big future stake holders may want to appoint a Board Member to Foundation instead.


[05/23/2021 11:03 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ @morphic @mhs_sam @Robert K how about to put Armeanio and Ilya to the EF ?


[05/23/2021 11:04 PM] kushti#0978
Not sure about CH/cFund, I need to reach CH first


[05/24/2021 10:48 AM] Justin1000#9555
Just my opinion below:
*Ilya: Should be good. He is super smart, worked on Ergo for years and worked for you for years so know him very well.
*Armeanio: I think is likely good choice. Seems competent, writes well and deals with the community very well. BUT it seems to me we should be vetting people a bit more especially after the Savo saga. Even more important now that price is up and we are anticipating incorporating a legal entity. So if you are proposing him, I would just suggest providing a resume or linkedin and confirming with him nothing in his background we should know about. Else it doesn‚Äôt seem we are doing our basic due diligence.
Its possible that someday in not too distant future the Ergo Foundation has many tens or even hundreds of millions worth of funds it needs to make decisions on. That is a lot of money to be determining how it is used and also could lead to a lot of scrutiny. So its unfortunately probably necessary to do at least some vetting of people first.
Another possible consideration is what I mentioned before about other stakeholders/partners wanting to appoint someone. But this is probably not a big deal and for CH at least if he hasn‚Äôt brought it up himself, presumably he is not concerned and just trusts you to handle things.

[05/24/2021 11:26 AM] Robert K#0722
Yeah I agree with @Justin1000 point of view here. And in either case we likely want to spread out adding new members to the EF rather than doing 2 at once, so if Ilya is added soon, then the next person (whether it is Armeanio or otherwise) should be added at least 1.5+ months later imo


[05/24/2021 11:26 AM] Robert K#0722
So it looks more reasoned and gradual.


[05/24/2021 1:25 PM] morphic#4133
I think Ilya can be a good addition to the foundation. Becides his skills, he also has beed with us through the hard times in 2019, 2020. For Armeanio, I don't really know him enough to judge. I like how he communicates with the community, he seems to be good at administrative things. Choosing between Ilya and Armeanio I would choose Ilya first. Agree with Robert, we need to put the candidates in queue and add them one-by-one. Also this can be a good marketing event and some kind of success story (positive story) spread out by marketing machine at a right time.

[06/01/2021 7:49 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti do you have a view yet on what we should do with the Foundation legal entity? Did you want to go with Singapore or still considering locations?


[06/01/2021 10:42 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 I am for any option


[06/02/2021 9:35 AM] Justin1000#9555
Okay. Well on May 19th and 21st I outlined why I thought Singapore was probably good choice based on prelim assessment. Its all above. As mentioned before,  if you want me to proceed, just reply to the Dentons email chain with ‚ÄúHi Kenneth. We have decided to move forward with the Singapore incorporation of the Foundation legal entity. Please follow instructions from Justin and accept payment from him on behalf of the future Foundation.

[06/02/2021 10:38 AM] Robert K#0722
I can also vouch for Dentons as they have worked with a number of projects that I know personally or friends of friends, and no gripes from what I've heard thus far.


[06/02/2021 12:00 PM] morphic#4133
@kushti please reply as Justin wrote above, this sounds like a reasonable move to me. If you don't have objections and agree to delegate this task to Justin, please do it ASAP. For me the Singapore variant also sounds quite reasonable.

Ergo Mining NTF proposal, by Nordic Colo

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/739896707013279885/851025274027769856/message.txt


[06/07/2021 3:06 AM] Justin1000#9555
Actually I know this group and did a conference call with them in Feb about Ergo. Their guy in HK, Chris, is friend of mine from ~5 years ago. Ex-ETC miner and they have ADA stake pool I believe.

This guy Jay was main guy talking to me on the call. Struck me as very smart and not just about mining but broader things as well. Think should take very seriously any proposals from him!

I think they have had thousands of GPUs mining ERG for at least 3 months ‚Äì I was talking to them about it way back in November when they were planning their GPU purchases. 

I think:
-‚ÄúGreen mining‚Äù should make great publicity and should be enouraged (personally I think the environmental concerns about mining are nonsense but it‚Äôs a very important negative narrative to counter anyway)
-This group made very favorable impression on me. I favor helping them to extent possible.
-Mining NFTs should demonstrate Ergo‚Äôs tech prowess, help decentralize mining, increase excitement in the ecosystem and probably get ERGs directly into hands of more long-term holders

That being said, not sure exactly what they want the Foundation to do here. I encourage helping them technically and encouraging them and helping to promote their venture but am doubtful we should be directly participating and signing any contract. Nor do I feel we should be seeking to make a profit in anyway ‚Äì probably Foundation should stick to strictly non-profit activities.

[06/17/2021 7:01 AM] Justin1000#9555
Just wanted to give an update that unfortunately have still not started the process of setting up the Foundation. This is due to the Denton's partner being unresponsive. He was sick last week after he got the covid vaccine. I think he is okay now but very slow to respond probably because he is super busy and behind after being sick. I have tried calling and been in touch via email and he said would send a scope of work. I am optimistic that this is temporary and everything will get on track ASAP and will have a better update soon on when we can get the legal entity set up. 

Separately my bank (Equity Bank in Bahamas) is now offering crypto custody and banking services. Probably we can custody some BTC and USDT/USDC with them and convert to fiat for fiat payments whenever we need. But I havent gone into depth with them yet as waiting for Dentons. If that bank doesn‚Äôt work then the consultant I know can probably intro to another one.

Hopefully will have better progress soon on this.

Looks like back on track. Gave $40k quote to set up entity and they provided a scope of work. Will talk to them about some details and report back before commencement. Probably things will get underway now.


[06/20/2021 7:30 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ Are we doing anything in China anymore? Eva has not been doing anything lately it seems except throwing some ideas out there on Ergonauts and maybe she is re-translating white paper and doing things when specifically asked. She was very motivated and self-starting before. I dont really want to talk to her on this and also do legal entity and other stuff.


[06/20/2021 7:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ paid her the $1800 monthly salary and then VERY predictably she started complaining and said she should get more. I think she is asking for RMB 20k which is like USD 3.1k. I knew that would happen as soon as saw Noah pay her $1800 as before we had been giving her bonuses out of our own ERGs because the $1500-1800 salary is too low (I gave her 1000 and Noah gave quite a bit more than me). She had accumulated 10k ERGs which makes $1800 a joke. So I was surprised when saw we just paid her $1800 and cancelled her bonus. Was obviously going to be a problem. She is important as she is representing Ergo for sometime already and is very proactive. So if it‚Äôs a pay problem, I think should either give her USD 3k equivalent or $1800 + 100 ERGs per month for rest of year as long as she is working on Ergo. I prefer latter option myself as is cheaper at current price but gives her upside so more motivating.


[06/20/2021 7:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
But she also raised issue of regulatory risk in China. But I have no idea what she is concerned about as shouldn‚Äôt be much risk for her. But before paying her more, should identify the problem and whether it is indeed pay.


[06/20/2021 7:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
What I want her to do or already asked her to do that isn‚Äôt happening includes:
1)    Articles: She stopped pushing us to send out articles on Jinse
2)    Update Chinese website: Have asked her repeatedly to sort this out. Nothing happening lately.
3)    Monthly report: I have asked repeatedly for her to do monthly reports based on quantative measures to Foundation. Haven‚Äôt seen template yet. Nothing happening! There should also be one to the Ergonauts (one to Foundation can include monthly payments of Ergs to all parties in China while one to Ergonauts just include the social media stats)


[06/20/2021 7:32 AM] Justin1000#9555
Anyway, guess will leave to @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ  to sort out if you can. Main thing is first to identify the problem I think. Probably just a salary problem but if it is fear of some regulatory issue or just unwillingness to do what we ask then should find out.

"Sichuan to Shutter Crypto Mining in Sweeping Crackdown
Another major cryptocurrency mining hub in China is moving to kick miners out of its territory as part of a sweeping clampdown amid regulatory concerns over the industry‚Äôs huge energy consumption and potential financial risks.

Several documents signed by government agencies in southwest China‚Äôs Sichuan province circulated online in recent days outlining plans to shutter all crypto mining sites in the province. One of the documents set June 25 as the deadline to complete inspections and cut power supply to the operations. It listed names of 26 projects that have been inspected.

The Sichuan provincial energy bureau told Caixin Friday that the agency was still verifying the authenticity of the documents. But separate industry sources said they are genuine."

Cryptocurrencies /
China dragoons banks, Alipay into crypto crackdown

China‚Äôs central bank called a meeting with several major banks and payment provider Alipay to reinforce a ban on cryptocurrency trading, the latest move in a sweeping clampdown on crypto speculation.

The People‚Äôs Bank of China summoned representatives from Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Postal Saving Bank of China, Industrial Bank and Alipay, the payment service of Ant Group, and told them not to provide crypto-related services, according to a statement issued Monday by the central bank.

Cryptocurrency activities ‚Äúdisrupt financial order and also breed risks of criminal activities like illegal cross-border asset transfers and money laundering,‚Äù the central bank said. All banks and payment companies must not provide services related to cryptocurrency transactions, it said."

The crackdown on Alipay could be significant in preventing Chinese from onboarding from fiat to crypto. I know for example that at least as of Sep last year, Hotbit would use Alipay for customers to send in Chinese yuan fiat to buy crypto.

[06/29/2021 2:36 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Just speculation, but I would not be surprised if there is a global conspiracy underway by big money to keep crypto prices down so they can accumulate before the next big leg up.


[06/29/2021 5:17 AM] Justin1000#9555
Haven‚Äôt really researched this but my view anyway:
*China has been researching Bitcoin and crypto since at least 2013 and has a very good grasp of it. There are probably different views in the government but generally guess they recognize its not going away and could be important technology for China in long run.

*But they are concerned about the scams, mindless speculation and possible disruption to the financial system. To be honest, I think we all know the vast majority of non-BTC alt coins are total garbage and so China doesn‚Äôt lose much to reduce speculation in these among its populace

*Mining was unregulated and using electricity they decided could be used elsewhere. I heard the ability of China now to get the cheap electricity from hydropower into the cities is better so mining is just taking away from this and bad for China‚Äôs reputation too. Also, I doubt they view much happening with the mining as being ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù as its just about cheap electricity and cost control

*China is rolling out its Digital RMB. They probably aren‚Äôt keen to have distractions right now

*China is extremely innovative now and is surging ahead in many technologies. But given the disruptive nature of crypto, I think the government has determined that they don‚Äôt want to lead innovation in this space at all and want the innovation and disruption to be abroad for now

*I don‚Äôt think China loses much by these measures. They can wait for a lot of the innovation to happen abroad and just invite the miners and integrate the technology back into China when they and how they see fit

Regarding us, attached is big report Eva did and gave to Angie on Ergonauts. A huge amount was done as you know but recently has been less. Eva has still been doing stuff but the three things I asked her to do not much progress lately:
1.    Jinse articles ‚Äì She doesn‚Äôt think they are that useful (I disagree)

2.    Website ‚Äì She said would update this when she gets her new phone working. Guess she will get started soon.


3.    Monthly report ‚Äì I wanted her to do monthly report highlighting situation in China but she sais its too hard. Not sure what the problem is. But the report above is pretty extensive anyway.


[06/29/2021 10:33 AM] Justin1000#9555
FyI: just submitted an article to jinse (ergo and bitcoin comparison ) . Guess Tango thought it was a good one


[07/02/2021 3:09 PM] kushti#0978
Guys I am off for one week (as said previously in development and ergonauts channels). I got pretty exhausted over the two years (and more, as before the launch we also had insane days), hopefully I will recover in this one week. I will check critical things like daily and also will moderate the weekly devs chat.

@deleted-role we need to decide about this new Android Wallet application https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/ergo-wallet-android which is developed by a community member. He is asking in #üõ†‚îÇdevelopment  about whether EF want this application to be published on Google Play Store under EF name. 
It would probably be desirable if: 
1) we had resources to maintain this application 
2) EF has plans about development team (under EF management)

I helped him with the initial development and added the missing features to Appkit and then also did code audit. So basically the App is ready to use and can be published.
We need to decide on our policy regarding such cases (we have similar application in progress for iOS by another community member).
I personally think that EF should focus on core platform maintenance (at least in the current state of the things). 
But let's discuss.

[07/13/2021 3:21 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I'm not clear what any potential risks might be. For example, in the future could someone outside of EF initiate updates or changes to the wallet, and if so, might such updates or changes possibly include bugs or even malicious code?


[07/13/2021 10:34 AM] morphic#4133
Publishing under EF name means EF takes ownership of the app and will have to maintain it (the same way we maintain Ergo Node, Appkit, sigma-rust, explorer etc.). Somebody (I don't know who can do this) should create Play Store account, pay membership fees, create singing keys, build and sign application release, publish it on the Play Store and pass through the google's audit process. After that EF (or someone on behalf of EF) can update the app with new releases. 
So basically we need to choose between two alternatives:
1) EF is involved. If we consider this app is important and is part of core Ergo ecosystem, we can on board this guy (if he is interested) and fund him on regular basis (My experience with him quite positive and I can surely recommend him for this role). In this case he will do all the development work and I can control the signing keys and releases on behalf of the EF.
2) EF is NOT involved. In this case we need to clarify our position why EF don't want to take ownership, what will be out message to MrStahlfelge and to the community, why EF don't support this project organisationally and only development support is provided. I don't want to say this is negative scenario, but we need to make it clear for the contributor. He has spent a lot of efforts and deserves some attention from EF.
If we decide to go this way OR if he rejects to ensure long-term support of the App, EF shouldn't take ownership of the App and publish it under EF name.


[07/13/2021 10:36 AM] morphic#4133
Anyone controlling the signing keys can publish new releases, this is similar to private keys, should be kept in secret.


[07/13/2021 1:27 PM] morphic#4133
It turns out MrStahlfelge wrote an email to the ergoplatform@protonmail.com email as suggested on our site, he is asking me about EF decision.


[07/13/2021 5:40 PM] Robert K#0722
Hmm, I think due to the limited extra resources in the EF it may be easier for him to take ownership of the wallet?


[07/13/2021 5:41 PM] Robert K#0722
I wouldn't be against giving him an Ergs grant for doing a great job in building it, and putting an EF seal of approval that the wallet has been audited by us (specifically you morphic).


[07/13/2021 5:42 PM] Robert K#0722
That way we don't have to have a further burden on the EF, the community can feel safe that the wallet is audited by us, the developer can get rewarded and have some extra clout in the community from having the wallet recommended by the EF, and overall everything should be good in said scenario


[07/13/2021 5:43 PM] Robert K#0722
Though if there could be a good use case to hire the dev, then the other option could be potentially worth it. I'm not up to date on the exact plans/roadmap currently.


[07/13/2021 7:40 PM] morphic#4133
Yes, this is something I also think we should do in the case EF don't have resource/plans to put wallet development into "core ecosystem" category. We should reward the dev for what he already have done and also encourage him to continue development


[07/13/2021 7:41 PM] morphic#4133
What about a grant in the range of 500-1000 ERGs?


[07/14/2021 8:37 AM] morphic#4133
Messages from MrStahlfelge he agreed to share here:

Ownership: There are three levels of ownership, Google Play entry ownership, GitHub project ownership, project ownership. I don't comment the latter ones here because you'll be familiar with these and the ups and downs, I have to stress the Google Play ownership again. There are two ways to go here, either the Foundation has the Google Play ownership or me. The foundation should do it theirself, because - and that's important - this ownership can't get changed later. Who has the key to sign the app controls the app updates, the only way around this is to deprecate an app and make a new one. To prevent misuse, Google bans apps (and developers) that are detected as impersonating. So having me as the owner has only downds here: probably no future control over the app for the foundation, and for me the danger of getting target of Google's ban hammer bots which usually can't be discusses with (Apple is usually less dangerous here).


[07/14/2021 8:37 AM] morphic#4133
Cross platform or not cross platform: From my experience, the "true" cross platform toolkits like Xamarin and Flutter have so many downs and restrictions while developing that the time they promise to save is wasted on problems you don't have when you don't use them. Additionally, the UI for Android and iOS should be different and use the typical native widgets - so I personally always opt for two apps, at least when it comes to the UI. As you audited the Android app's code, you have seen that the actual code is not so much. Having this code doubled for iOS is not so much effort. 
A difference is the actual business logic layer, that means appkit and the server request calls. I would always try to have that layer be a single code base, if possible. My first approach here would be to test if a iOS framework with RoboVM can be build and run. As we now have Java 7 compatibility and my experiences with RoboVM are very good, I am optimistic that this will work (but not sure). As I told you before I found RoboVM way more mature than Kotlin Multiplatform. 
When this works, there are still two ways to go: building a framework with iOS to use in a Swift app, or using RoboVM for the whole app. RoboVM can use the whole iOS SDK and I personally hate Apple's development tools every time I use them so I would prefer this if I would do it (this is also based on my experience at my work where we have double as many iOS developers than Android developers because they iOS devs need twice the time for everything because they usually fight their build tools), however, the downside is that the typical iOS dev can't step in. I am not afraid that RoboVM can't be used any more, on the contrary the project's maintainer is a genious committed to it and making a living out of it, so other as a company he won't turn it down for some political reasons.


[07/14/2021 8:37 AM] morphic#4133
This one is the easiest: If wanted, I would love to take over the mobile apps, developing and managing them. If it is paid, I would even use Apple's IDE and Swift for iOS when told to do so üòâ What could also be done and is exactly my field of interest is a desktop app (like Electrum) that might be needed, and the intersection of a desktop app with mobile apps should be very high regarding the shared code layer. I know this is probably not on agenda right now, but I saw users asking for it, too.
That being said, because you asked for a full time commitment - that's beyond what I can offer for multiple reasons. However, I think that the mobile apps don't need a full time developer. What I could offer is a part time position. My usual day job is also a remote position and I can arrange my time by my wishes, so it won't interphere, and based on what you offer I could reduce my worktime there. We can also start with task-level donations/bounties which is low risk for both of us, such a task could be "building the coin freeze app for ios" or adding other features.
I understand that the discussion need time on your part. I just asked because a month is already some time without no reaction.


[07/14/2021 1:16 PM] Robert K#0722
I am fine with giving a grant in this range. I haven't been able to see the quality of the results so can't say whether lower or upper bound of that range.


[07/14/2021 1:17 PM] Robert K#0722
I would also be fine to have him be "the mobile guy" and have him working part time for Ergs on a constant basis for the EF personally, as it would be good to have someone leading that.


[07/14/2021 1:17 PM] Robert K#0722
I think this needs more input though from people building out the roadmap/comparing with existing plans.

I think he is suitable to not only be a "the mobile guy" but also he will be able to maintain Appkit and potentially also ergo-wallet/sigma (basically everything needed for wallets and apps). Based on CV he seems to have necessary skills.

So I suggest to proceed in two steps:
1) I create a voting topic to decide (in principle) on whether EF want to onboard MrStahlfelge as permanent part-time (50% as he suggested) payed developer.
2) If the voting is passed, then I will ask MrStahlfelge for his expectations in compensation. Then we can negotiate.

Kalita is Ergo platform wallet


[07/20/2021 8:02 AM] Robert K#0722
Which will also be for mobile, so it'd be good to just get a feeling of what the underlying vision going forward this to have a good feeling of what to fund as the EF


[07/20/2021 8:04 AM] Robert K#0722
Granted they have a Q4 timeline and are not funded yet, so probably makes sense to still have MrStahlfelge to keep improving the android wallet and other parts of the ecosystem


[07/20/2021 9:20 AM] morphic#4133
"Wallet is in crowdfund phase, so nothing here yet" (source https://kalitawallet.net/docs/getting-started/download/)
So basically they created nice pictures (which looks really good) for crowdfunding, but don't have any code yet.
Their Q42021 deliveries "A basic wallet that can send/receive Ergo on Android devices. Encryption with Android Keystore system." is exactly what MrStahlfelge has done, so basically they can copy the code (ok, even rewrite is much easier).
So I think this two completely different cases: 
1) Kalita - is a crowdfunding-first community project which doesn't require EF support 
2) MrStahlfelge - is a community developer (no team behind) willing to join  Ergo development, found a way to demonstrate his skills by implementing ready to use application. I think we need such kind of developers to support core ecosystem.


[07/20/2021 11:11 AM] Robert K#0722
Yeah I agree it's worth funding him.

@morphic who will manage MrStahlfelge as a dev ?


[07/21/2021 8:49 AM] morphic#4133
I will be mentoring him to get up and running. He will hopefully lead the direction and report to dev chat himself. I will also do code review.


[07/21/2021 10:02 AM] morphic#4133
The message from MrStahlfelge
"we really need to get the google play release rolling if the EF is willing to. the planned ban of anonymous wallets in the EU is another reason why I should not publish myself (as I am EU based). I don't know how the EF works, but it would be good if someone in charge sets up a Google developer account soon. It is a one time US$25 charge for it"

I'm not sure if EF should create a google account. It probably make sense to do by EF Inc. once it is ready. This is organisational issue, not development.


[07/21/2021 3:17 PM] kushti#0978
Anyone has time for that ?


[07/21/2021 3:17 PM] kushti#0978
Also , lets consider new EF members? Armeanio, Ilya ?


[07/22/2021 2:08 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Previous comments about adding  Ilya and Armeanio started here


[07/22/2021 2:09 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
I'll vote yes if/when formally proposed.


[07/22/2021 5:01 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah thought we already agreed to add 2 people and Armeanio should be fine. 

Does Armeanio want to be on the board? Kushti if you haven't spoke to him about it guess you can just tell him "we are considering new board members and would consider adding you if you are interested and to supply your resume". Seems we should at least know the background of who we add.

The other question is timing. Guess doesn't make sense to add people before entity set up so maybe at same time.

But its taking a while so maybe just add them both when entity is set up. Or could still add Ilya on day 1 and wait a month or 2 after entity set up to add Armeanio like Robert suggested originally. Either way probably okay at this point...


[07/22/2021 10:46 AM] Robert K#0722
Yeah I would recommend adding them with some space in between, but doesn't have to be too long


[07/22/2021 10:46 AM] Robert K#0722
Once the entity is officially set up adding 2 people in succession just looks like good natural growth


[07/22/2021 10:46 AM] Robert K#0722
So I think that makes the most sense personally

The CEO of Jinse is on the chat with us


[07/24/2021 5:28 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think they are new wallet. 3.5k daily users. 30k users total.


[07/24/2021 5:29 AM] Justin1000#9555
They want our help with development and would like us to make it the "official ergo wallet".


[07/24/2021 5:29 AM] Justin1000#9555
It is closed source but they seemed liked would consider open sourcing it if we want


[07/24/2021 5:30 AM] Justin1000#9555
I don't think we could make it the only official wallet of course but guess we consider promoting its use if we were comfortable with it


[07/24/2021 5:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
In terms of development I doubt we have too much resources to dedicate to this but maybe Mr. Stalfelge could help if doesn't conflict with his own wallet too much


[07/24/2021 5:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
Anyway I am just throwing it out there to keep everyone informed..not sure what we should do on this


[07/25/2021 12:02 PM] Robert K#0722
I think it wouldn't hurt to add another wallet in the ecosystem, but definitely branding it "the official ergo wallet" is not going to work.


[07/25/2021 12:03 PM] Robert K#0722
If they do a decent job and it works well, I would be fine for the EF to do some promotion with an article, and maybe interviewing them, and potentially put a youtube video out how to use the wallet.


[07/25/2021 12:03 PM] Robert K#0722
But that's probably as far as we could go imo


[07/25/2021 12:48 PM] morphic#4133
One time open sourcing doesn't count. They should move development to open source and release new versions from there in order for us to consider "official ergo wallet". They may not be ready for this switch business-wise.


[07/25/2021 12:49 PM] morphic#4133
If this open source project contributing to Ergo ecosystem we can promote and support it as any other project we already support and promote.


[07/25/2021 12:59 PM] morphic#4133
The goal of MrStahlfelge, as I see it, is to push forward an open source implementation of The Wallet App, so that others can use it:
1) as a ready to use wallet App
2) as reference implementation to adopt in other wallets (like kalita)
He also came up with an idea of Ergo Cold Wallet App which seems feasible to implement. (Recently discussed in #deleted-channel)

Things have been moving very slow with Dentons. I think they are totally swamped with work. Its probably okay though as other things like exchange listings have been moving very slowly too.

But have done a few rounds of Q&A with them via email and they have solidified their recommendation. Probably they are ready to move forward more quickly now.

Attached above is the email summary from the Partner at Dentons. I have put some initial comments and questions in red.

Hope you can have a look though and if have any questions or comments can raise them. I will do a call with Dentons tomorrow afternoon.

I think this is clearly connected with what we need and discussed before. Also agree with your comments.


[08/09/2021 7:24 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think Armeanio was approved to join Foundation. Please add him to this group and also announce it to community. I think we should consider also adding additional members like Glasgow if he is interested and subject to getting more info on his background.


[08/09/2021 7:40 AM] Justin1000#9555
Had call with Dentons on Friday. Update on Foundation:

*CLG structure is best given non-profit nature of Foundation

*Incorporation Agent: He will provide us with contact who will set up entity and provide the local person Nominee.
 
*Tax rate: Same for CLG vs CLS. But CLG less likely to be determined to have tax domicile attached to persons who are controllers of CLG. This is because there is no avenue of distribution to the Members.

*Members vs Directors: If all the same then each Member will ‚Äúwear two hats‚Äù. Everyone who is a current Member should also be a Director. Kenneth seems to think this is optimal way to set it up. 

*Ring-fence Foundation: Kenneth suggests that certain activities only be conducted by subsidiary entity(s) of the Foundation. This might include development-related activities. In future announcements this would also need to be clearly stated. When finalized think we can get some guidelines from him on how announcements should be made.

*Dual Track ‚Äì Work with corporation agent at same time as finalize constitution. Use standard constitution with incorporation agent then drop in final version immediately upon set up. So can have everything done in 3-4 weeks (but I suspect will take longer given how slowly things have gone so far).

Thanks for taking the calls @Justin1000 .


[08/09/2021 10:02 AM] Robert K#0722
So the idea would be to also open a subsidiary entity via Dentons for development-related activities?


[08/09/2021 10:02 AM] Robert K#0722
Or would it be best for the EF to officially not do any development, and merely hand out funds to devs/teams in the ecosystem


[08/09/2021 10:03 AM] Robert K#0722
Though the question of who owns the Github org comes up I suppose.


[08/09/2021 10:04 AM] Robert K#0722
Would be worth asking them imo if we could get away without a specific entity for development and consider everyone working on the project to be paid as effectively contractors by the EF


[08/09/2021 10:04 AM] Robert K#0722
Having multiple entities adds extra work/problems/costs, but it is doable if needed I suppose.


[08/09/2021 10:13 AM] Justin1000#9555
Will check with them their thoughts on these alternatives


[08/09/2021 11:06 AM] morphic#4133
@Justin1000 I agree and hope single entity would be enough. Also there might be some potential issues with taxes for  Members (without taxable income) also being Directors (with some salary) also being Contractors (with monthly income). This can be interpreted as tax avoidance in Singapore as Contractors don't need to pay Singapore taxes.

Above is Brian O‚ÄôHearne‚Äôs linked-in. He is a close family friend. Was trail blazer in weather derivatives for decades and for at least part of that time was the #1 guy in the world at it. 

He was the guy that introduced us to Arbol I think last year and Robert and maybe Kushti had a call with them. He was at Arbol at time as he sold his business to them but he has since left them.

He is retired but looking for stuff to do part-time and is interested in working with Ergo somehow. VERY smart but I doubt he is crypto expert as that was not his background.  He should also be well connected in US and could be good for his maturity and resume. 

So I am not sure what he could do for us. But I wanted to let you know. If we do have something suitable for him to do, would be good to grab this opportunity and get him involved! 

Maybe could inform Armeanio. Brian lives in Kansas City but goes to Colorado quite often I think. And anyway they are both in US.

Hey üëã Seem to have been added here too so I figured I'd paste my cv and some background info. I'm also a director to a recently established non-profit in the uk (Community Interest Company).  Not sure if that's a positive or a clash but would love to be involved in the EF 

Not included in the CV - Grew up between Scotland/England/Belgium/US due to my Dads job (editor of the WSJ), didn't really know what was going on when I moved back and ended up floating about various IT/design roles before going back to get my degree (and a adhd diagnosis - to no ones surprise but mine).

Initial exposure via crypto-anarchism and privacy which led to me inadvertently co-founding the first darknet market. (before silk road/btc) but what Ergo is doing was always the end goal.

My thinking is we try to find an accountant in Singapore.

They can handle the foundation logistics, bookkeeping and reporting on the ground for the EF as well if needed.


[08/19/2021 4:19 PM] morphic#4133
I think there are two types of accountings we will need. 1) required by laws to run the entity 2) internal accounting of EF assets, monthly spendings both regular and one-time
This in principle can be done by different people, but if legal accountant can also do internal accounting this may be easier to manage.

[08/20/2021 8:19 AM] Justin1000#9555
From Le Yu, our likely accountant:  "1. We handle the entire General Ledger and Financial Statements accounting to the reporting. We do not do audit. That can be done by our Audit Partner firm.

2..For Crypto transactions, we work with our Crypto accounting software partner Cryptio. Clients can subscribe to their software which is interface with exchanges, custodians and digital wallets. Crypto transactions can be downloaded and link over to our Xero Accounting software G/L. So it becomes automated. Clients needs to purchase the Crypto software and Xero software. We will map out in the first set up and provide the full accounting services as a package.

After the company is incorporated we can table our Accounting and Tax Compliance Services etc. for your consideration. "

[08/24/2021 9:46 AM] Justin1000#9555
Had call with Le Yu. Please review the attached. Key things to takeaway:

-Should be ready for some troublesome process steps including KYC that needs certified true copies of passport/proof-of-address

-Need to be ready to pay $25-30k upfront to get Le Yu started. This can be done via USDT to Altonomy but also requires KYC to Altonomy (although apparently this KYC is easy)


[08/24/2021 9:46 AM] Justin1000#9555
Other things:
-Treasurer: I discussed with Le Yu and it seems the Foundation should appoint someone to the treasurer role. This person can take the lead on getting the Xero and Cryptio accounting software set up and do their best to take the load off @kushti going forward. They can in future liase with Le Yu and auditor to make sure they get what they need ‚Äì most likely this wouldn‚Äôt be too difficult as the accounting software should do all the heavy lifting

-Tax: In touch now with Dentons tax partner. This is still not clear but will try to get some clarity from them.

-Bank Account: 
Le Yu can get it for us with great bank but requires US$1mm minimum fiat balance. This would be ideal but seems too high.  

I have been in touch with Equity Bank in Bahamas‚Ä¶ http://equitybankbahamas.com/en/equitys_crypto_product_suite_lionpressspring2020
I had detailed email exchanges with them in early June and they are very clear on Ergo‚Äôs background. They said they can provide services to us. They said should have license by end of this month.
BUT I only consider this 50-50 of working out given the license from Bahamas is unpredictable and something else could go wrong

From my side, the only other solution I can offer is to pay a consultant who helped me find a crypto bank account before $3k or $5k IF he can find account for us. Up to you guys if we do this or not‚Ä¶if want to maximize chance of getting bank account in timely fashion, then I recommend doing it‚Ä¶only a few k extra anyway

Of course, if anyone else has bank account solution, that would be good too


[08/25/2021 11:43 PM] Armeanio#0321
I think it would be good to get guidance on pros cons of different jurisdictions.

If the Bahamas is ideal, let me know how I can assist.

The summary of my call with Dentons on tax. Dentons didn‚Äôt go so far as to make a formal recommendation but on the call they seemed to be guiding in the direction of filing and paying any applicable tax in Singapore. You can see the notes for details.


[09/03/2021 6:19 AM] Justin1000#9555
Redline says 10-15% is what they normally charge for cash out. Seems crazy high to me but they say they normally use sophisticated techniques like ‚Äúwave trading‚Äù etc in their MM activities and do more than other MMs. 

Unfortunately, I am having all the detailed conversations with them on this stuff (in Chinese so maybe not convenient for you to join) and I don‚Äôt know much about MM details. I told them max we would pay is probably 1%...they said would discuss internally but usually they provide a lot of resource-intensive stuff for MM, so charge more. The CEO mentioned they normally have 5 bots + 3 guys working in shifts 24/7 to do MM on one client. They want to do all exchanges for efficiency if possible.

Leave it you guys to keep Redline as MM or not. But when making the determination, I think you should consider 1) value of relationship ‚Äì they are a pretty big Chinese group‚Ä¶maybe good to stay friendly with them; 2) value in having more than one MM; 3) I think we paid them 3 months anyway. 

If want to try and get more from them, then tell them exactly what you want in telegram and ask for a proposal. I can separately follow up with them in Chinese to get the best offer. Then if still no good can drop them I suppose. Anyway leave it to you guys to decide.


[09/03/2021 6:25 AM] Armeanio#0321
My thinking is we should leave things as is. I think the relationship with Redline has value, I think having more than 1 mm has value as well. 

If Redline can't match Coinls at 1% then the question becomes is 1% worth @kushti taking the time/energy to set up how we are currently raising funds.

That is up to him.


[09/03/2021 6:29 AM] Justin1000#9555
By the way I think 1% is a totally reasonable amount to pay to save time for @kushti doing it himself.

Agreed


[09/06/2021 3:52 AM] Justin1000#9555
From Liongate (the crypto arm of Equity Bank, the Bahamas bank): ‚ÄúYes, you can apply to have a fiat account which is separate and apart from your crypto custody account. You can provide instructions for each account. The fiat account will likely be with Equity Bank Bahamas and the crypto custody account would be with our crypto financial company Liongate Bahamas. If you would like to liquidate the crypto that you have within your crypto custody account, then you would provide an instruction to Liongate Bahamas to do so, and then the fiat can be deposited to your fiat account with Equity Bank or wired to your account of preference. Liongate Bahamas would also be able to assist with making bill payments from your crypto custody account if the bills requiring payment will accept payment in crypto form. Support documentation would need to accompany crypto bill payment instructions.‚Äù

So strong indication they will provide us with bank account if we want. Probably could have say $500k to $1mm in USDT/BTC held with them and keep a fiat balance of say $100-200k. Then make fiat payments from the bank account and whenever needed to get additional fiat, could just ask Liongate to sell some BTC/USDT to replenish the fiat account. They could make crypto payments on our behalf so wouldn‚Äôt have to do ourselves all the time.

But I still recommend exploring other alternatives too. Also, as far as I know Liongate doesn‚Äôt yet have their Bahamas crypto license although it should be imminent.

@kushti Do you or anyone else have someone good to do the treasurer role? I think they would need to be technically capable and good attention to detail. But most important thing is they would need to be honest and discreet as would have access to monitoring all funds flows. Could advertise the role but might be best if you have someone you know well who could do it. They would need to track ALL funds flows and use the Cryptio software (which can connect to most exchanges) to track everything and upload it all to Xero (the accounting software used by accountants/auditors). They would also need to carefully track bank records. Then they would need to deal with the accountants and auditors for periodic reports (probably just insuring all the data tracked and uploaded to Xero would be most of this).

Can we incentivise mining in the testnet? for all aspiring devs it is a pita that it does not work all the time. Or just have the foundation run a mining rig?


[09/07/2021 12:45 PM] morphic#4133
I don't think EF should run the rig, it is not very easy if one doesn't do it professionally. 
As an idea, we can do the following:
1) since Testnet is also a public blockchain, we can create an incentive for pools and miners to allocate some percentage of their hashpower to the second Testnet network.
2) To make TERGs valuable, we can create a market of Testnet ERGs (TERGs) on ErgoDEX (TERG/ERG pair) and buyback using some fixed price. 
3) To not spend the treasury EF can even create a crowdfunding on Ruffle to collect ERGs which can later be used to buyback TERGs on DEX.
4) We will need to implement some swap of TERGs on the testnet into TERG tokens on the mainnet.
Again, just a rough idea.

üß† 

[09/07/2021 12:59 PM] glasgowm#9381
cool ideas, maybe even a ERGX/TERG pair? but might introduce additional legal complications.

but yeh I think Raffle + TERG/ERG would be great to get it working short-term - If that's the issue? I seen someone responded in #‚ùì‚îÇdev-support that there are miners right now - but tx's aren't being included in blocks.


[09/07/2021 1:13 PM] mhs_sam#1471
the issue is not due to miners, there is a bug to be patched in node. We did the patch by kushti on our node. Also, I'm running a miner on the testnet. sometimes I need that miner for my other local chains so I stop mining in the testnet for a while.
I do not think monetizing testnet mining is a good idea since it will takes a lot of time and resources to manage another network. 
There are three ideas I can think of. 1) changing the node to allow only 2-3 miners (even with cpu). Actually 1 is enough but 2-3 for availability is recommended.
2) renting some dedicated hash power for testnet
3) having someone with 1-2 gpu on testnet. I used to do that and it's simple. I said what's the problem with my miner, and I think I cannot add any other gpu to my setting (currently 3 gpus and a server) due to my power draw limitation

[09/07/2021 2:04 PM] morphic#4133
Some more thoughts. 
Yeah, I agree, better to keep it simple as long as it works. As I remember we already tried 2) and 3) points before and we are still there. So, yes, we can also try the point 1) above. But again who will run those miners?
I don't think the Testnet have to be our liability, it should be our asset. And better yet, a money generating asset. 
With TERG/ERG market we can also have TERG treasury on testnet (to fund testnet development) with some different tokenomics (different emission curve, always 15% goes to treasurey from every block until end of emission etc.)
Yes, this is like running another network.

@glasgowm , in more detail, I'm thinking that  after kushti and morphic write the dev job descriptions, you can  make sure they get posted on ergoplatform.org / twitter / etc. Should also try to post on some job/recruitment websites or other 3rd party channels (maybe ask @Robert K if he knows some good places to hunt for dev talent). Then you collect the resumes and put them all in one place for kushti and morphic (maybe make  Google drive folder). You could also screen out people who are clearly not qualified before passing them on to kushti and morphic, especially if we're getting a lot of resumes. What do you think?


[09/09/2021 9:16 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah pass them to me and I'll stick them on a spreadsheet and push them through.

We're putting out ones for an accountant and tech writer too right? I can start generic drafts of these to help


[09/09/2021 9:58 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah that sounds good.

Do we have a dedicated email for this? or could we set one up?


[09/09/2021 10:03 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
there is team@ergoplaform.org and ergoplatform@protonmail.com
Last I knew, only @kushti and @mx receive those, so maybe add you to the receiving list, or you can just set up a new email address I guesse.


[09/09/2021 10:10 AM] glasgowm#9381
can I get access to those too (or have them forwarded to me?) and I'll set up notifications and post to relevant channels. Heard a few complaints that they go unanswered. Could maybe automate a bit too (autopost to channel here / autorespond)


[09/09/2021 10:21 AM] glasgowm#9381
Think these are all the roles I've heard mentioned?

Please let me know an ETA @morphic @kushti so I can remind you 

Also really think we need someone to fix the node as it's a major point of frustration for people and @kushti also spends a lot of his time debugging node issues for people.

Needs to compare the height to the explorer and at least accurately inform the user it's corrupted. Or ideally be able to roll-back and fix itself. Ideal if someone could make it a 1-click thing like ErgoMixer. 

I'll bridge the support telegram to discord today as there's a few more people on here that usually help with debugging.

Finding good talent is challenging these days in general.


[09/09/2021 1:37 PM] Robert K#0722
We're primarily using a bunch of different job boards but nothing has worked better than just personal leads from people we knew


[09/09/2021 3:31 PM] morphic#4133
anon_br is ready to work on Yoroi half-time (~20 hours/week). 
I think he is suitable for the job (skill-wise), but we don't have an obvious evidence of it (e.g. solid open source project). 
I expect everything should be ok, but we can offer a probation period for a couple of month (Sept, Oct) and in November decide on a more long-term agreement. We will also get feedback from Yoroi team about his work.
I propose 10 USD + 1 ERG per hour rate to start with (which is 4800 USD per month when working full-time, current Ergo price)

He is really motivated to join Ergo development, and can also do server-side development.


[09/09/2021 3:46 PM] Justin1000#9555
Sounds good to me. I can't judge his qualification for it but will say if he can start right away then that is a big plus. Wallets are extremely important and an area I think Ergo is lagging in so if we can hire any other devs to work on Yoroi or other wallets, that would probably be a good idea too.


[09/09/2021 3:47 PM] morphic#4133
I have similar thinking about this. Will talk with him about this and create a post for the formal voting.


[09/09/2021 3:50 PM] glasgowm#9381
Seems good to me, enthusiastic and active across the community. Maybe if yoroi doesn't end up being a good fit he could build on that c# interpreter / manager platform Trovoslsky was working on (think he said he would release something about now)


[09/09/2021 3:54 PM] morphic#4133
Yeah, he mentioned 17 years of experience and solo development of ERP. This means he can solve problems across full-stack. Good sign to me.

Unless any objections from @kushti or @morphic , if you feel comfortable with it, I think you could try to recruit a debugger/node person from discord. Maybe you have someone in mind already. Could talk with them and work out a tentative proposal (obviously don't make them any promises).

Apologies for how long the entity is taking to set up. I finally just got the draft of key docs from Dentons. Just 2 docs. Never worked with lawyers so slow before‚Ä¶I think it is because we are a small client and they are extremely busy. I have provided a few basic comments and questions to them already. Will drop the docs and Engagement Letters from Le Yu here in the next few days with comments and next steps - biggest next step when everyone is okay will be paying Le Yu ~$30k and then doing KYC with them. Once we pay Le Yu, they will provide us with Registered Address.

I took a shot at drafting the Treasurer job description. Not entirely satisfied with it so others feel free to comment and improve and whoever is taking the lead on the search can get this published in the right places and applications collected. This is time sensitive as I think we need this before we start the operations of the incorporated entity. If @kushti or someone else know someone good for this role, then maybe can forego the whole public job search as I think the most important single attribute for this role is reliability and honesty so someone already know well could be best.

Attached above is:
1 ‚ÄìDeed of Confirmation. This is that ‚Äúownership attribution‚Äù doc I mentioned before. Same time Foundation is set up need to confirm the ownership of the assets is with the Foundation. I think this just need be signed by Kushti, Morphic and Catena

2 ‚ÄìBoard Resolutions. Resolutions at start that also reference the Deed of Confirmation and confirm ownership to the legal Foundation entity. It also resolves to set up exchange accounts in Foundation name etc. Think we can just do this as soon as practical (Treasurer should do it)

3 ‚Äì Le Yu EL for Professional services of incorporation ‚Äì this doesn‚Äôt include accounting which will come. Can‚Äôt recall for sure but think the accounting is like S$5k a year only. The auditor is separate and more expensive.

4 ‚Äì Le Yu EL for serving as Nominee Director ‚Äì S$15k per year with additional deposit of S$15k.

Pls review the above. If any comments or concerns can let me know so I can revert to Dentons or Le Yu. I put some of my own comments in the Dentons docs. But don‚Äôt think I see big problems with anything.

Above is no way conclusive in anyway. But @kushti mentioned on last call we should discuss what type of things the EF should be funding. So I just put some initial thoughts down on paper for consideration/discussion. People more familiar with other Foundations than me might have better insight.


[09/14/2021 6:32 AM] Armeanio#0321
This is a very solid start. I think the only area that is missing from this document is a focus towards education.

Developer Education
Community/User Education

Looks good. I'd lead more towards eventually moving towards community governance; especially as that appears to make you slightly less of a target for governments. Agree education should be a priority to lower the barrier for entry for devs (along with bug bounties)

Not sure of the practicality of mining subsidies. On a related note though - @mhs_sam was speaking to a private company that were planning a nft voucher mining rental thing on ergo which sounded interesting.

On the EF taking donations. we've had a few people try and set up raffles already to 'donate to marketing' but maybe we can just point them to the donation forum thread instead.


[09/14/2021 3:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
@kushti


[09/14/2021 4:36 PM] mhs_sam#1471
I need your thought about some questions:
1- Is it okay that I'm running the ergoraffle? both legal and EF side.
2- Raffle can be used to raise money for exchange listings. Is it good?
3- idk if this question suites here though. Ergodex on cardano has lots of benefits for Ergo, but mostly about advertisement and recognition. I was wondering if Ergodex on cardano takes the fee in wrapped_ergo or sth like that. It will increase the need for ergo. is it possible? or desired?


[09/14/2021 5:34 PM] morphic#4133
1) Don't know about legal part, but for EF I think this should be ok. Even in the case of any conflict of interests (like deciding on funding ruffle), your vote can be simple excluded from the counting, as the conflict resolution measure.
2) Interesting idea. I think it is ok, when EF have a concrete proposal from Exchange and the amount fixed and known. And if the exchange itself is agree to receive funds collected by ruffle. There may be some legal issues though. And maybe ruffle users should also sign some legally meaningful statements somehow.

I do not have access. It was supposed to be so?


[09/14/2021 6:10 PM] Armeanio#0321
1)    I don‚Äôt see an issue as long as you are able to recuse yourself when necessary. I think Morphic makes a good point about this. Regarding the legal aspect of a incentivized raffle, I would imagine the largest part to take into consideration is just what is on the disclaimer. 
2)    I have already spoken to a few smaller exchanges, as this is an interesting use case. There are two points. ‚Ä®The first is that is needs to be approved by the exchange itself as it discloses sensitive information (which smaller ones are open to so far in my discussions)‚Ä®The second is that they need to accept ERG for payment. ‚Ä®If you want to test this on a small tier exchange let me know I can set this up. 
3)    This is would probably need to be a decision made by ErgoDex. ‚Ä®My initial thinking is that if it was launched as a standard it might act to slow growth vs using ADA. I would think that it might be more useful once there is supporting infrastructure for wrapped_ergo on Cardano it would increase the use case and be positive.


[09/14/2021 6:11 PM] Armeanio#0321
Sorry this is quite important for you specifically to see.


[09/14/2021 6:11 PM] Armeanio#0321
The initial meeting went relatively well. This seemed to be a basic inspection to make sure we didn‚Äôt raise any red flags.

The next step the Ergo Foundation needs to do is make a donation to the Binance Charity Foundation. More information can be found in the following article I received from Justin.

https://insidebitcoins.com/news/binance-makes-updates-to-listing-fee-policy-to-donate-100-to-charity

They want us to donate to https://www.binance.charity

I will get more documentation on this tomorrow most likely. We will need to discuss the amount that we want to donate.

One interesting thing we can consider, and I will speak to the Binance Charity Foundation about is Raffle.

We can have a ‚Äúbase‚Äù donation from the Ergo Foundation.

We could also start a raffle since it is a nonprofit. Set the actual needed amount at 1 erg, have the lowest possible fee, and tell the community to donate if they want.

This would need to be made VERY clear in the raffle itself. We would need to disclaim heavily.

THIS IS FOR THE BINANCE CHARITY FOUNDATION, NOT A LISTING.

This may be a way to community fundraise and also ‚Äúshow off‚Äù some of the tooling our system has to offer.

I imagine that has never been done.

Since it is a nonprofit organization it does fit the raffle vision.

Let me ask the Binance Charity Foundation team. I will get their perception then we can discuss the possibility in-house. Either way, it is a nice way to start a conversation and make some contacts.

Spoke to anon_br and greenhat since I wasn't sure anyone was integrating ledger into a wallet. greenhat is writing the sigma-rust components and in touch with tessaract. 

anon_br said they're focusing on getting the dApp connector out at the moment, but it's almost there and he was thinking of moving onto the ledger integration next - says he will discuss with Ruslan. Maybe be worthwhile getting another person for it? or a 3rd party to handle the Ledger Live stuff? Sounds like it's going to take awhile still to get even basic functionality working.

[09/22/2021 5:46 AM] Justin1000#9555
Left out a couple points in notes: 

**Insurance:** Doesn't sound too bad. Probably cost $10-15k per annum and Le Yu can make intros to Marsh when convenient. Don't need this before entity set up so we can leave aside for now and just get done ASAP as soon as entity set up.

**Bank Account:** I think we should pay them the S$1800 for assistance with bank account. They said that they have some contacts in Switzerland and elsewhere with crypto friendly banks and could introduce us and seems these ones don‚Äôt have the minimum $1mm balance the Sing banks have. We get the money back if doesn‚Äôt work. I will pay them tomorrow for that if no objections.

Le Yu will drop everyones 5A.KYC info into the Company Incorporation Form. 

We will need to vote of Directors. 
Directors are outranked by Members and act on the consensus of a Member Vote. (Similar to how the EF is already structured)
Additional forms are required for the Directors once appointed.

I have two concerns I would like to bring to your attention. 

1) As you know, I'm Iranian and we are under US sanctions. I do not know if it's possible/suitable for a legal entity to have me on its board without any future problems. I do not want any harm to EF from my side.

2) I do not have a valid passport and cannot renew my passport. I have a passport actually but its date is expired. 
In Iran you have to go to Mil. Service in order to get/renew passport; two years ago I made a choice not going to service and work full time for Ergo and I'm really happy with this choice. Anyway, I cannot renew my pass due to my service situation. I cannot tell when this situation may or may not change.

Hey! Yeah I been thinking about you last day or so. I am also concerned about the Iran issue and unfair treatment you guys get and fact we don't want that to negatively impact Foundation. I actually don't know if it is a real problem or not myself but I do know some exchanges and potential partners especially in US will ask for background on all Members. So suppose could potentially be an issue. 

Regarding passport it might be possible to use national ID instead but I would have to check. KYC doc says passport though.

If it doesn't work maybe you can still stay involved in Foundation as observer or Advisor or something. Just maybe not part of the actual legal entity (if it is indeed a problem)


[09/22/2021 12:11 PM] glasgowm#9381
We have a couple people in DSUK who can't be legal directors due to conflicts of interest - but still participate the same. So shouldn't make any difference in day-to-day operations just means he couldn't participate in official votes. (I believe, only been incorporated a few months so will double-check)


[09/22/2021 12:50 PM] glasgowm#9381
Have you had a chance to look over Treasury role yet @kushti  ?

I figure I could just make this live and start pulling the feelers out if there's no objections since you'll have a chance to evaluate the candidates anyway?

Yeah sure, to be honest my priority is EF and Ergo. So, do whatever benefits the EF.
I do not seek any position or formal relationship. Anyway it is the best of my honor to work for Ergo in the next years as far as I have something to contribute. my partnership can be completely informal and without any affiliation (even honorary).

Longer term it is possible post integrations with US exchanges to add you as I doubt there is any DD post listing.

The structure upon incorporation will be similar to what exists, members vote and then directors act based on the quorum.

You will just be an "unofficial" official member of the Ergo Foundation. Off book but equally important.


[09/23/2021 11:13 AM] Justin1000#9555
I doubt I caught everything important but attached are my initial comments/questions on the Constitution to discuss more with Dentons. Finalizing the doc (just needs to be ready when entity is finalized in 3-4 weeks) is not urgent but I think important for everyone to have a read of the constitution to understand better how the whole entity is meant to operate. 

Members have final say because can appoint and remove Directors. But Director role is still important as they are the ones who would have ability to execute agreements, sign-off on disbursements and other actual conduct of Company ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù. 

The Constitution may imply Directors can do x, y, z without members sign-off but I think we would still stick to our practice to-date of having all members vote on anything important before we would want a Director to go and actually execute something important like an agreement for a new partnership, new big expenditure etc. In the unlikely case, a Director was routinuely violating this arrangement then the members could always remove them.

[09/23/2021 11:22 AM] Justin1000#9555
We can apply for ACRA as soon as the forms are filled out and sent in. ACRA takes 2-8 weeks to approve. But based on what I heard before it should only take 3 weeks.  

Seems we can start the ACRA application without the CTCs if absolutely necessary. So if for example @morphic has everything on hand like proof-of-address etc but just doesn‚Äôt have the CTC then he could send in everything else and just get the CTC done ASAP when done traveling. 

Unsurprisingly I am also having problems with CTC. Went to notary today but useless. Talking to HK lawyer but they don‚Äôt have solution yet either. Probably can solve it soon though‚Ä¶hopefully.

I will check with Dentons whether a contractor employment contract can be signed with MrStahlefege on a pre-incorporation basis. Otherwise probably looking at like a month unfortunately.

The other thing I am concerned could cause a delay is the Treasurer. Unless we can do careful recording and tracking, we probably should not start the entity without that role filled and someone up and running. Else it might be more difficult to insure accurate financial reporting from the day the entity is established. Seems we don‚Äôt have someone good in our immediate circle so you are probably right to start the job search.


[09/23/2021 11:27 AM] glasgowm#9381
Constitution looks good will read in more detail later. I'd opt for keeping privacy/decentralisation if possible and just rewording them. (ie, Promote the decentralisation of the protocol) 

Will reach out to headhunters and do some searching today - @MrStahlefege seen the draft listing in #ergonauts and said his old boss might be interested. Tons of people with a financial background in our community so maybe someone decent will come forward once it's up.


[09/23/2021 11:28 AM] glasgowm#9381
I've requested a notarised bank statement and will get my passport done in the next few days.


[09/23/2021 3:04 PM] glasgowm#9381
```Is that Treasurer role full time or can be done at evenings and weekends?```

Should be fine right? Or would we need them full-time for availability in meetings / to make one-off payments, etc?

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Corey Donahue and I'm interested in applying for the Treasurer position. I've attached my resume to this email for your convenience. A few things you won't find on my resume are also listed below for additional context. Please let me know the next steps if you find my resume suitable to your requirements.

Additional Points of Interest:
 - I've been a holder of ADA since 2017 and a more recent holder of ERG with a firm understanding of IOHK, Emurgo, Cardano and the Ergo Foundation.
 - I was the lead financial manager on an account worth approximately ~$1 billion in annual revenue with primary responsibilities of creating, editing and presenting financial updates to the C-suite of a Fortune 10 company.
 - I have extensive experience building, developing and managing financial reporting all the way through the lifecycle of new accounts.
 - I have worked with some of the largest public and private corporations in the world and utilized a robust suite of software for financial reporting, accounting and predictive capabilities. 
 - Most importantly, I believe cryptocurrency and more specifically blockchain, has the potential to revolutionize the world and would like to support that possibility to whatever extent I can.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon. 


Respectfully, 
Corey

[09/24/2021 6:45 AM] Armeanio#0321
We may need to vote on Directors before submitting 5A KYC, as this needs to be circled at the top.


[09/24/2021 8:06 AM] mhs_sam#1471
His resume and experience is amazing, but I'm not agree to have someone with "top secret clearance", "Special Force Command", and "Arts in Homeland Security" onboard.


[09/24/2021 9:39 AM] Justin1000#9555
I tend to agree. Anyway lets keep collecting CVs and see what the options are. Think we got to be careful with the choice on this role.


[09/24/2021 10:09 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah, probably need to decide who Directors are going to be in next few days. I am not too keen to be one myself. I don‚Äôt anticipate being involved in day-to-day execution to that extent. I think ideally would be 3 Directors. 2 MIGHT be enough at minimum. 4 would be fine too if there is that many people who want to be Director. 

I managed to get my CTC done. Anyway, if everybody is 1) confident can get CTC done in next 1-2 weeks and 2) has all the required docs on hand in non-CTC form like the Proof of address and passport scan then I think we could just schedule the video call to sign all the docs. Then that starts the ACRA process and we should be ~3 weeks out. So possibly we can do that call and signing next week sometime.


[09/24/2021 10:25 AM] glasgowm#9381
There's been a few other applicants but I didn't want to spam here. Tried to make a new channel but not got the perms to add you. Think @morphic and @Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ are the only ones missing from the new server if yous can join there I'll put them under #deleted-channel under the Foundation category. https://discord.gg/GMYACRG2Nr

Interestingly we got another applicant from the military. 3 in total now. 

Should be able to go get my CTC next week once the bank statement arrives, just making sure my address is consistent everywhere as I moved a few times past few years.


[09/26/2021 10:37 AM] Robert K#0722
Hey, just wanted to check in and bring up that it might be best for me not to join the official EF entity myself as I clearly have been one of the least contributing board members in the past few months. I know all of you here are working really hard on the project, and I wasn't even able to keep up with what was going on this week with the calls/forms for example because I've been swamped with stuff in dcSpark. I don't see that changing in the near future, so it may be best for me not to waste everyone's time by going through all the legal hoopla to be an official member of the entity who doesn't end up contributing sufficiently (and then opting-out of that role is going to be more costly in the future and an annoying process).


[09/26/2021 10:41 AM] Robert K#0722
I'm happy to continue being part of these chats if so desired/offering my opinion if so desired on whatever matters, and if for historical reasons you'd prefer to have me still part of the EF as some sort of honorary member (akin to what mhs mentioned) I'd be fine with that, I just don't think I can sufficiently contribute these days to warrant being part of the official entity and do the role justice.

The China ban seems serious this time. Quite disappointed‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt expect it to go so far. 
-Now basically everything illegal as announced by PBOC and going to be enforced my multiple agencies and the local governments

-Bunch of reasons for crackdown are listed including cryptos are disrupting economic order, encouraging gambling, illegal accumulation of assets, money laundering, scamming etc. And jeopardize national security ‚Äì so serious list of accusations against crypto and seems nothing positive to say about it

-Many national laws and regulations evoked and cited to enforce the crackdown

-Explicitly stated all forms of crypto transactions illegal and illegal for offshore exchanges to offer services to mainland Chinese residents

-Looks like going to be comprehensive effort with many national agencies and local governments all enforcing the crackdown


[09/27/2021 4:15 AM] Justin1000#9555
Some of this stuff has been implied or announced before but this is taking it to another level. Since it was announced a few days ago:
-Huobi and Binance said would stop all new account registrations for mainland residents
-Huobi is going so far as to force closure of all existing mainland accounts by year-end
-Binance and Okex claim they already don‚Äôt serve mainland residents
-USDT decoupled from RMB
-Wechat groups are already starting to disband


[09/27/2021 4:15 AM] Justin1000#9555
Given China‚Äôs household savings is ~$30-40 trillion, I think this is materially bad for crypto in general and Ergo in particular given our big progress in China this year.

Will be watching to see what Jinse does but Eva mentioned they had already disbanded their wechat group(s).  Don‚Äôt think I will be doing much in China myself in the meantime. Probably things to watch going forward:
-Level of enforcement (I wouldn‚Äôt doubt them though based on this announcement)
-Whether Chinese crypto wechat groups continue
-Jinse continuing to operate or not (they are based in BJ and should know whats acceptable or not)
-Conferences continuing to happen or not
-Chinese crypto investors willingness to take risk and trade crypto anyway on Dexes etc ‚Äì there is speculation that they will have ways to get around the rules. I am not so sure myself that most will want to take the risks though


[09/27/2021 4:16 AM] Justin1000#9555
Maybe it won‚Äôt be as bad as it seems. But I really don‚Äôt know why they would make such a strong announcement if they aren‚Äôt serious. 

Am considering whether we should shut down our wechat groups. Those were painstaking to build and I think we have like 10. Big loss. We are asking people to join Telegram and will need to have much better management of the telegram group going forward. Eva wants Up to manage it.


[09/27/2021 9:04 AM] Justin1000#9555
Seems P2P is still okay. So means should be reasonable amount of ongoing activity and movement to Dexes. But any business activity for transactions seemingly including OTC brokers seems illegal now. Will presumably be much harder from now on for mainland people to go on and off crypto via fiat. Guess will see how things start to play out in practice over coming weeks.


[09/27/2021 7:17 PM] Armeanio#0321
Unfortunate, please keep us up to date.


[09/27/2021 7:22 PM] Armeanio#0321
With the recent signaling from the US and increased scrutiny from China should the Ergo Foundation start considering longer-term jurisdictional arbitrage in our exchange listings?

What are everyone‚Äôs thoughts in seeking exchange partnerships in friendlier jurisdictions. If there is a larger regulatory tightening it is feasible that certain areas may see greater liquidity as a result.

For treasurer.

A friend of mine, trustworthy and reliable. 

Background is accounting, finance and management. 

Bilingual Russian and English. 

No experience with crypto software but I believe could pick that up quickly as she has experienced with other accounting tools. 

Could also act in a dual role as an executive assistant to Kushti, could take some of the tasks off his plate and let him do more development.

Based on the resume, looks like could do it. @kushti, didn‚Äôt you say you were going to Dubai? When? If very soon, you could meet her for quick chat to see your impression.

But in any case, probably should decide in next ~1 week to try her or not. If so, she may be able to spend ~3 weeks getting up to speed before the entity is incorporated.

@Justin1000 @Armeanio can I become director later.? Could be easier to start from early 2022


[09/29/2021 5:59 PM] Armeanio#0321
I think she is in Russia at the moment due to a death in the family. Krasnodar.


[09/29/2021 6:01 PM] Armeanio#0321
I don't know her plans, I can ask . Traveling to you if needed might be easier short term.


[09/29/2021 6:03 PM] Armeanio#0321
I think you are fine to be added as a director later if necessary. 

The one downside is a lack of ability to sign official documents/direct funds, as this is something you currently do.


[09/29/2021 6:05 PM] Armeanio#0321
Will I be the solo director in this case until 2022? Or will anyone else want to join?


[09/29/2021 6:07 PM] glasgowm#9381
I'm happy to join to fill a seat if it's easier for me due to UK law


[09/29/2021 6:08 PM] Armeanio#0321
I think it is better to have more than 1 director.


[10/06/2021 5:15 AM] Justin1000#9555
Sorry I don't want to be Director. I wasn't too keen on it to begin with for personal reasons but would do it if not for this recent China policy. This is far more severe than past ones and I think will even intensify so probably not a good idea for me to be on a executive role at a Defi platform right now unfortunately. Really too bad!


[10/06/2021 5:16 AM] Justin1000#9555
But if you guys are okay everything is ready go go with the entity it seems. Can sign the docs whenever and have it set up in a month.


[10/06/2021 5:17 AM] Justin1000#9555
We should look to add additional directors within next 6 months. Maybe 1 or 2 more is sufficient


[10/06/2021 5:18 AM] Justin1000#9555
I don't think absolutely necessary for you to meet her although would be good. Should meet her when possible anyway. Face to face meeting always good and she will be doing an important role.


[10/06/2021 11:24 AM] morphic#4133
I think @Armeanio  and @glasgowm can be our directors, if they agree. I personally need to have legal income ASAP, don't have one since 2019, which is not good for many reasons.


[10/06/2021 11:27 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yep happy to do so. 

Got all my documents now, first available appointment with a lawyer was Saturday so I will have my CTC ready after that.


[10/06/2021 12:00 PM] morphic#4133
Regarding CTC, it turned out to be more challenging than I could imagine. Still cannot find a lawyer who can sign the docs. They all suggest to go to notary and the notary cannot do this because of some low restrictions. One of the reasons is the Russian Passport is partially translated to English, and that makes it somehow uncertifiable by local notary.


[10/06/2021 3:12 PM] Justin1000#9555
Maybe you can find an international lawyer like an American or UK one. Will be expensive probably but would think they can do it. I got lucky because I have a friend who is an American lawyer based here who did it for free.


[10/06/2021 3:59 PM] Armeanio#0321
I can be a director.


[10/06/2021 5:04 PM] morphic#4133
It seems I found one company from legal500 list. They ask for 500 EUR for each document certification. Will try notary certification first with translation to English.

To start she would fly and stay near kushti for a week and work in person to sort/organize the books, payments etc. 

Duties would include 
Track funding/create budgets
Run payroll/expenses
Work with Li Yu in Singapore 
Act as an administrative assistant to Kushti 
Handle any Russian tax preparation/ paperwork for Russian members.

Anastasiia looks good to me, I think she is suitable. Diploma in Maths and programming skills is definitely a plus for money accounting role. üôÇ 
I suggest a probation period of 3 months without decreasing a compensation (basically just a chance to know each other better considering the delicacy of the role). 
The goals for probation period:
1) setup assets accounting and management workflows (get up to speed with software etc)
2) establish monthly internal and annual external reporting (version 1) 

If no red flags and she will still be willing to work on the role then a longer contract may be signed.

Hi all, I'm thinking to delay my membership in EF until second half of 2022 when I become TAX non-resident in Russia. The main reason is I don't want to deal with Russian TAX agency on this matter. The CTC documents I provided and signed will still be valid at that time. To make it easier for EF I can join with other new members in 2022.

sorry for the ping in #üí∞‚îÇjobs-bounties kushti but not sure how to price something like that. Sounds like something we'd want to fund anyway?


[10/27/2021 2:31 PM] kushti#0978
for Ergoscript-by-the-example entries, there's 500 SigUSD bounty per entry already


[10/27/2021 2:32 PM] kushti#0978
For apps, I propose to reward 3-5 first apps with 1K sUSD for command-line implementations, 2K for web-based UI

That'd be a great incentive to have. 

What he's wanting to do is write actual step-by-step tutorials though - not necessarily ergoscript. Something we also sorely need and should be incentivising to speed up imo. No real structure for this currently so I propose awarding 'upto 500 SigUSD' or something for them and then reward based on merit/quality?

what can we do regarding the ERG price? How much we have in our AMM account? is it sufficient? Does adding more in AMM account have any benefit for the price?


[10/28/2021 11:24 AM] kushti#0978
Sounds good


[10/28/2021 11:24 AM] kushti#0978
Sufficient funds I guess, not sure about strategy chosen by the MM


[10/28/2021 11:25 AM] kushti#0978
Had a call with CTO of IOG

Joint possibilities with IOG:

- There's Rosetta framework from Coinbase  , we can build on top of it to get into light wallet with contracts certification from IOG  (and Coinbase eventually)
- we can try to get Hydra working on top of Ergo
- there's R&D group working on trustless bridges, we can join it
- some R&D like mempool protection from spam scripts, implementing accounts in UTXO model  etc


[10/28/2021 2:04 PM] glasgowm#9381
I wrote notes for the last EF meeting so you can see discussions about MMs/treasury status/etc there. Not sure there's much we could do tho.


[10/28/2021 2:21 PM] mhs_sam#1471
yeah, I saw that yesterday. Actually, I was wondering if adding the AMM funds may help


[10/28/2021 2:22 PM] glasgowm#9381
not sure it's enough to make a difference. That whale pumped almost 10M in the other day and barely made a dent


[10/29/2021 5:34 PM] mhs_sam#1471
so I bought about $138k last night by putting order at $9 (Erg was 8.6 and only 2k Erg up to 9$), and it made a difference. 
The timing was also good, since we had some podcasts today.
So I think we need to do more on market making, maybe the first step is to take some advise from an expert. What do you think? and do you know someone?


[10/29/2021 6:08 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah good timing heh. Not personally but @Armeanio has been speaking to the MMs about increasing the volume I think. The MMs for changelly/btc seem pretty authentic but not much volume there. 

Think KuCoin is Redline which @kushti might've felt were a bit suspect. Not sure what that entails but this sell pressure has been unprecedented and the orderbooks are weird.


[10/29/2021 7:32 PM] Armeanio#0321
Kushti and I have a call next week with a market maker. You are welcome to join us.


[10/29/2021 8:30 PM] mhs_sam#1471

[10/30/2021 7:47 AM] Justin1000#9555
I doubt MM is the problem or the solution to the low price. I have heard a little over past couple years how can boost price through MM‚Ä¶maybe it is true but I suspect it 1) requires a lot of tokens and money that some other projects have because 30-50% is held by insiders and 2) is expensive. But yeah, good idea to check with CoinLS what they think. Maybe there is something that can be done at least.


[10/30/2021 7:48 AM] Justin1000#9555
I thought the price going down was highly predictable in light of no more exchange listings, slow news flow and ErgoDEX taking a while and other factors. The problem with the price is:
1)    Exchanges ‚Äì this is the #1 addressable problem in short-term. At least theoretically addressable although has proven very difficult. Getting listed on top exchanges will lead to an immediate big price re-rating and a boost to adoption in short and longer term. Ergo is not competing on remotely the same level for mind share as other layer 1s as long as it isn‚Äôt on the top exchanges

2)    Ergo adoption is still low ‚Äì TVL is next to zero. DEX roll out slow. Even when dex comes out, I doubt will lead to too much more adoption until it is integrated to other chains like Cardano, ETH etc or until the broader Ergo ecosystem develops which will take a little more time. This is coming along but it just takes time because Ergo is capable of so much and it is unique. Getting on top exchanges will speed up the process.

3)    Marketing ‚Äì This is still not good enough of course. But I don‚Äôt see it is as the major problem any more given the big progress in community driven marketing, reddit etc. 

4)    More wallets and better UIs and more functionality


[10/30/2021 7:48 AM] Justin1000#9555
Given the actual adoption is still low, Ergo price is driven by speculation and hype. Huge progress has been made on marketing and so many are willing to speculate on Ergo even before adoption. But I think this is a bit difficult for Ergo as its not centralized database dressed up as a block chain with fancy features, 1 million TPS etc and in a bull market the average intelligence level of the crypto investor goes to lows as hordes of new people join and most simply are unable to appreciate Ergo‚Äôs innovations. 

Tremendous gains in the price are possible as long as get on the exchanges and adoption starts taking off. Exchanges besides huge short-term boost to price will also boost adoption. Probably there is a tipping point where the Ergo ecosystem completely takes off along with the price. But the bar is probably high for Ergo given it is potentially such a vast ecosystem capable of so much.


[10/30/2021 7:48 AM] Justin1000#9555
Kucoin charges trading fee of 0.07% so I don‚Äôt think should boost volume there. If we got free trading fee on Gate.io and Coinex, then could consider having Coinls or Redline take over one or both of them and boost volume.


[10/30/2021 7:50 AM] Justin1000#9555
Maybe marketing is still a significant problem. Only ~40k twitter followers veruss 180k for Sundae swap...one project on cardano...weird

anyone heard of https://woo.org/ ? It's a trading platform with huge liquidity claims, introducing itself as a bridge between CEXes and DEXes.

[11/02/2021 10:42 PM] mhs_sam#1471
on bridges, the waves on gravity is almost done and is under test. The eth and other bridges should be based on wormhole (since we have gravity it will not take too much time). 
Anyway, these bridges are decentralized. But, as you can see the Conceal network is doing custodial bridges with ETH and other chains. I think we can do the same. We can provide custodial (and multisig) gateways to distribute wrapped-ERG on eth and BSC. Being on these networks will provide (at least but immediately) an opportunity to use their DEXes.


[11/03/2021 1:46 PM] kushti#0978
The biggest question is who will maintain the bridges


[11/03/2021 1:49 PM] mhs_sam#1471
who is maintaining the waves one right now? maybe the EF can do it? or a Msig with some famous entities on the target chains?


[11/03/2021 1:51 PM] mhs_sam#1471
or even EF and ErgoDex?


[11/03/2021 2:09 PM] morphic#4133
I think we can have an Infrastructure Grant which compensate operational expenses of the infrastructure servers. EF already funds some of such servers, but in order to scale we can support such work in the community.


[11/03/2021 2:11 PM] mhs_sam#1471
I think @kushti has concerns about trust and liability. 
on the costs, yes we can provide support for a while. However, I think the the bridges would be very profitable even with a low fee

Can we add Angie to this channel? Of course she is not a Foundation Member, but I think she should have a channel where she can present her ideas to all Foundation Members. I'm worried she might be coming up with plans and ideas that die in the cradle before being given consideration by all Foundation Members. Any objections to adding Angie to this channel?


[11/04/2021 7:12 AM] Justin1000#9555
I dont think she should be added to this channel. She is just working for the foundation not a member. Should we invite everyone to this channel? Defeats whole purpose


[11/04/2021 7:12 AM] Justin1000#9555
But I think her reporting should be clarified and maybe we need a new telegram group or something strictly limited to foundation members and the heads of key areas working for foundation

Concerned that in past maybe Angie has had some ideas and just bounced of kushti or something and haven't got any traction.  If she has ideas shouldnt just go to kushti.  Maybe adding Glasgow and Armeanio is enough or maybe a telegram group. But should think about reporting lines and structure. Kushti should mainly be focused on development and inspiration i think.

@kushti hope you can get your docs signed asap. Seems incorporating entity is a real issue for some exchanges from what we heard from Armeanio before so should get done asap. I will just tell LE Yu we are okay with @morphic joining.next August since they want some confirmation.


[11/04/2021 7:58 AM] morphic#4133
Yeah, this is a good point, if there is a fee component of the service we shouldn't fund it. However, if there is no way to collect fees, but the service (or server) is needed for the infrastructure (like faucet service, testnet etc) then it is better we have a grant so that people can apply. We can also encourage Good Whales to participate in such grants as sponsors which is even better then spending EF funds.


[11/04/2021 9:19 AM] morphic#4133
We used to have a lot of integration tests for ergo node running on the dedicated server (https://jenkins.ergoplatform.com/ which is not available anymore). This is another example where we need funding and systematic technical maintenance. So the Infrastructure Grant can include also DevOps position (at least part-time)


[11/04/2021 9:25 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Agree, so then  let's create a Foundation Telegram group where we can also add Angie so she can have a direct line with Foundation Members. Thoughts from others?

we can have a secondary foundation + key members in discord. I prefer discord for this, but tg is good too.

[11/04/2021 12:00 PM] Justin1000#9555
Sounds good. I think we should be careful to limit who is in there though. Should probably just be Foundation members and people in charge of certain areas like marketing, China ,exchanges. Dont need individual devs or others in there. basically Foundation members plus those who might bring proposals to spend Foundation funds.

[11/05/2021 12:22 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
Yeah, but the difference is that Ergonauts Telegram group now includes Ergo foot soldiers, and includes tactical planning and execution (and lots of discussion and chat). 
New Telegram group would be streamlined for Ergonaut generals, similar to the Discord fund-board channel, for high level strategic planning and proposals that need voting on for funding.  Purpose of the group would be to 1) allow Angie (can add others too if/when needed) to submit strategic/funding proposals to the Board, and; 2) Ensure privacy, since we don't need such funding proposals to go out to the entire Ergonauts group.

[11/05/2021 12:57 PM] glasgowm#9381
Should I just make a group here on Discord then? Angie's here too - easier than another telegram chat for me.

Ergodex is delaying for approx. 2 weeks. Yoroi and dApp connector are being combined now so waiting for that.


[11/05/2021 1:48 PM] morphic#4133

Maybe not a bad idea to ask. 

Luivatra has the tip-bot working on Discord with native tokens and tx chaining . He plans to use the same backend and make Tg/Reddit ones too. He was also working around explorer issues - I've asked Ilya to price bounties on the three issues people have came to me with.

Does anyone have any thoughts on Thorchain? I know a guy who is extremely close to one of the Founders and also very active in the Thor ecosystem. We could start to explore Ergo getting added to Thor and getting access to liquidity on Thorswaps. I took a prelim look at it and think its pretty interesting:
-Somewhere in between custodied wrapped assets and fully decentralized cross chain swaps
-Seems to have good community and excellent marketing
-#52 ranked with US$4bn market cap
-Only somewhat decentralized but possibly enough for what it does
-Ethos seems good
-In middle of adding Monero: https://twitter.com/monero/status/1457755811460128769?t=Tmk5V_bF-Vg3sQAS3m48ww&s=09
Probably Ergo-Thor would make a fairly good match ethos-wise, would add liquidity, be good marketing event and may lead to other things. I can talk to them more but if you have any thoughts or really are not interested then can let me know. We could start exploring cooperation probably and getting Ergo on there although I don‚Äôt know what costs and work that would entail yet.

Getting on Thor sounds like quite a process. Here is what I was told below.
-------------
‚ÄúAs far as integration with Thorchain goes the number one thing is for their dev team to join TC dev Discord and propose their chain: https://discord.gg/Spdvuu4b 
 In order to add a new chain to THORChain, there are a few changes the Ergo dev team will need to make: 
 - Thornode changes 
- Bifrost changes 
- Node launcher changes 
- Smoke test changes 
- xchainjs changes 
 Here is the link to the most comprehensive document that lays it all out for you:  
 https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode/-/blob/develop/docs/newchain.md‚Äù
‚ÄúNext, they need to rally their community to provide liquidity to the staged pool in order to win the slot and churn their pool in. Obviously, those are very broad strokes, but if they follow this process they should be doing well. Keep in mind that TC is designed for short tail assets, and it may be difficult to convince node operators to a dd a chain with no significant trading volume etc.‚Äù

Just FYI - seems ergodex solution won't end being so decentralised as someone (bearwhale?) is scanning mempool and changing their miner fee to win the tx.

would you please share some information about:
- what was our current strategy with tier one listing, which is failing now?
- What is the main issue with listing? fees, liquidity, contacts?
- I'm really eager to know why some shitcoins can be listed on binance immediately? Isn't it just pay the fee and be listed? (sorry if dumb question)
- how this hiring will affect our liquidity and how much?
- $10k or 10k erg?


[11/11/2021 9:06 PM] glasgowm#9381
All been approached, some ignoring - some got back and said specifically that volume wasn't good enough. 

shitcoins can be listed because they're ERC-20, so they'd rather ignore integrating native block-chains when they could do ten erc-20 tokens in that time.


[11/12/2021 1:31 AM] Armeanio#0321
Our current strategy has been to try to list on tier 1 exchanges without fully addressing the low liquidity ergo has. 

The main issue with listing is liquidity, exchanges sit in the middle and collect fees. This is their business model. Unfortunately exchange agents do not understand or care about the underlying technology. 

Ergo has two primary weaknesses at this point. The second is that it is a mainnet blockchain. This requires extra resources and integration time vs a native asset. 

Shitcoins are not mainnets so the Integration process into preexisting exchange wallets, that already support native tokens is a very simple process... and is also highly profitable. 
Low overhead/high return.

This puts us at a competitive disadvantage.


[11/12/2021 1:34 AM] Armeanio#0321
A market maker helps keep liquidity available in ranges which helps stabilize prices. 

A market maker will trade both sides of the spread and uses arbitrage and bot trading methods. Having the same MM on two exchanges allows for the market maker to also shift liquidity to take advantage of  price differences.


[11/12/2021 1:35 AM] Armeanio#0321
Hiring Kairon costs 12k usdt a month.

 10k for the initial exchange, and 2k per additional exchange.


[11/12/2021 1:35 AM] Armeanio#0321
I would recommend we put them on Gate and Kucoin.


[11/12/2021 1:42 AM] Armeanio#0321
This also opens the door to the Ergo Foundation to take a portion of the treasury, use it as liquidity, trade and potentially create a diversified portfolio. 

This could be a method of creating a "bear market fund" which I think would be a wise idea to always maintain.


[11/12/2021 1:47 AM] Armeanio#0321
I think creating a long term relationship with an mm that we can carry across multiple exchanges (which as we get new quality listings increases arbitrage potential) is the best way forward.

 It can grow to be a form of passive revenue for the treasury if done properly.


[11/12/2021 1:51 AM] Armeanio#0321
In the best case scenario we also get whales to start participating with liquidity pools on dexes and run MM on central exchanges.  

This boosts the overall volume, which is what exchanges watch and care about. This opens doors to new exchanges. 

If needed we can adapt as organic demand increases from greater market exposure.


[11/12/2021 7:11 AM] mhs_sam#1471
Thanks for clarification. One more question; Nervos for example, has a chain and it's not a token but it is available in almost all famous exchanges (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nervos-network#markets). Maybe it is helpful to be in contact with them and asking about their strategy/listing contacts/MMs. 
anyway, does proposing more listing fee works in our case?

Yeah not much money making focus in Ergo ethos unfortunately. And only a tiny award of $9k in hackathon while Solana had $5 million. Probably should have had ErgoHack award total at $100k at least. Going forward may want to think more about how to market Ergo more in light of how people can make money on it.

[‚Äì]Potices 1 point 5 minutes ago 
Really cool! Would actually be interesting to base my undergraduate thesis on something like this.

Just curious. Would there be a way to share profit to token holders by profit instead of revenue? You could of course calculate profit by subtracting some set amount of fixed expenses. But could that amount of expenses potentially be set by a DAO?

My friend introduced me to who he calls the ‚ÄúGodfather of Thorchain‚Äù and I had a call with him last night about ways to work together with Ergo. Seemed like really good call and I think we have his backing to explore integration with Thor on a step-by-step basis. Summary:

-A key theme for Thor was making the ‚Äúcommunity wealthy‚Äù (something Ergo needs to work on seriously)
-Community building, not so much marketing
-Have already integrated BTC and similar coins to Ergo so probably not too hard. But would need liquidity pool and this would be key challenge to overcome (told him we could look to solve the problem with combination of marketing, foundation and whale help). They also have some examples of incentivizing liquidity
-Can do marketing to make the Thorchain community aware of Ergo and get behind Ergo (same with Ergo for Thorchain)
-Thor has 5 financial primitives for smart contracts which can be used
-Has other ideas including NFT campaign to focus on 2 issues: 1) technical and 2) marketing
-Integration: 5 steps to integrate with Thor. He can outline all these to the appropriate Ergo devs to do.
-So can proceed on a step-by-step basis. First step is confirming our interests to take forward. Then need to form a team and start discussions. @kushti, can you form the team of devs? I think should also involve @Armeanio and @glasgowm  of course.
-I am already in telegram group with those 2 guys so can invite the appropriate people in when your ready. Thor is #60 ranked with >$3.5bn market cap and big community. I think would be a lot of upside working with them and their ethos seems solid too.

Separately, hope the next hackathon is soon. Also, I think should consider focusing it on 
‚ÄúMaking Money on Ergo‚Äù or ‚ÄúCommercialization of Ergo‚Äù or ‚ÄúTokenization of Ergo‚Äù and cover business models, profit sharing and ways to make money‚Ä¶next one after that can be about privacy‚Ä¶privacy less urgent to cover. Also the Hackathon reward should be SigUSD 100,000. $9k is WAY WAY too low in today‚Äôs crypto industry. Besides it is SigUSD which is easy for the Foundation to acquire.

Also, my friend who introduced me to Thorchain (he is a big community member in Thor) is crypto VC guy investing in seed rounds. Seems to do it in a real crypto style way though without contracts and stuff so maybe more compatible with Ergo ecosystem than normal VCs. Probably open to investing in anonmyous projects etc. Would probably be good to get people like that in the Ergo ecosystem as they can help guide project builders on how to make actual business models and tokenize things and give them funding for marketing. But need to do our part to get the community more focused on this and get the tools in place.

" Also the Hackathon reward should be SigUSD 100,000. $9k is WAY WAY too low in today‚Äôs crypto industry. Besides it is SigUSD which is easy for the Foundation to acquire."

on this part, I totally agree. I think we should reward 50-100k for each hackathon(up to 6 each year), and also we should announce a yearly big award ($500k for example). This big prize can be rewarded to the best dapps of the year (must be participated in the hacks?) in each ergo summit.


[11/27/2021 10:59 AM] mhs_sam#1471
this big prize also can have some categories, like best marketing campaign, best dapps, best social media influencer, ...


[11/27/2021 4:12 PM] Armeanio#0321
I agree, increasing the hackathon rewards and building partnerships would be good. It's easy to create marketing partnerships but actual commitment with joint development is a different animal. Time and dev resources are needed to get things done. 

Imo we also need to get more educational content together to onboard devs longer term. 

I am a big fan of the plutus pioneer program I think we should try ro replicate this for ergo. 

The turnaround and actualy value/dapp creation has a delay but it seems to be a solid foundation to build on.


[11/30/2021 6:54 AM] Robert K#0722
Hey, @kushti messaged me asking when would be best to announce I am not going to be part of the EF anymore. As you guys know I haven't been contributing much and have stated previously I won't be part of the legal entity, so at this point I believe it is primarily up to you guys/marketing to determine when would be best to time this so it doesn't cause any hiccups/issues with any announcements or otherwise.

Equity Bank in Bahamas seems okay with us subject to us sending in our passports and passing KYC. BUT they are saying $250k minimum balance. Seems too high for us at the moment.

[12/07/2021 5:09 PM] Armeanio#0321
In potentially bootstrapping a community dao I think it would be best for @mhs_sam to take point for the EF.

We want to create a framework to assist projects with a path to market, contacts for legal compliance in tokenomic frameworks, legal opinions for exchanges, potential funding (VC, seed investors or otherwise) and exchange contacts. Essentially clear the way for a path to market. 

There is at least a theoretical discussion in house about leveraging contacts, opening doors for projects and in return to try to create a community driven development DAO that accepted donations from projects for this service. 

Since I would be a point of contact, I wouldn‚Äôt actually participate in the DAO in the spirit of decentralization. 

The general idea is to create a community fund that primarily consists of different projects building on top of Ergo that can collectively fund marketing, R&D, basically whatever the ecosystem needs in parallel to the Ergo Foundation.

It is early and still in the concept stage. However, I think there is a lot of long term value in bootstrapping this concept.   

The general intent is infrastructure and collaboration between projects.

It is always easy to have empty marketing partnerships in crypro but productive collaboration always requires time, devs, resources etc.

Preface


[12/08/2021 8:01 AM] mhs_sam#1471
I was thinking about the investors after the meeting. Here are my thoughts:
- we do not have many assets for selling to investors
- by selling them some Erg we cannot obtain much money
- having investors is necessary
- Erg is very undervalued in comparison to other projects
- only 1 investor has some risks and drawbacks, at least 3 is more robust

So, I think a good strategy is to use investors as leverage.
- we can start with the first one, sell to him at max of 20% off
- use the fund to buyback the ERG in the market (buying strategy is needed)
- we will lose some ERG, but hopefully, at the new price of ERG our portfolio is more valuable.
- we can repeat this process for a while with likely up to 3 investors. Each new investor is buying at a higher price (even with a discount)
- The process may seem to be lossy, but I think selling to 3 investors at price tags under $10 will cause more damage in the future. Also, in the end, I think the total sold ERG will be lower with the same acquired fund.

- The investor can be informed that his funds will be used to buy back in the market, so the price will go up immediately. This can be considered as an extra discount to the investor. 
- This process without media coverage will cause only some pumps without any sustainable effect. So I think this process is better to be started with Harrington who has a media accelerator.


[12/08/2021 8:11 AM] mhs_sam#1471
This strategy may have some variants:
- as an example, we can have Harrington buy say $5m worth of ERG in the market in a period of time. to recompense, we will offer a pre-agreed amount of ERG for free.


[12/08/2021 9:07 AM] glasgowm#9381
I would not be opposed to trying it with some, I imagine the MMs can do it much more effectively though. Maybe putting $1m in their grids would be more effective. 

But I also think it's kinda futile at the moment and our price is dictated by BTC and ADA (essentially acting like leveraged ADA as shown in the img). I think we need to focus hard on the Wormhole partners + things like CCX and the privacy community to build up a broader base. (and those things mentioned in the ergodex link above)

But also think this should come after we have built up suitable reserves to sustain the ecosystem for 2 years. Could be throwing it away if we put it back into ERG and then BTC goes into a bear randomly. (I'm thinking we might extend until 2023 but best to play it safe)

I will speak to Anastasia and add in the missing expenses I know to try and push that forward. Can dig out some from the EF forum and discord chats. But ideally we should be increasing our spending rapidly to take advantage of the bull-run, and DCA'ing the treasury into SigmaUSD with price increases or something.

[12/08/2021 5:19 PM] Justin1000#9555
Seems okay to me...I guess that was already old as of Mar '21 so if the amounts need to be a higher now that would be understandable. Can pay SigUSD i suppose.


[12/09/2021 6:09 AM] Justin1000#9555
So great EF is finally incorporated. Maybe @Armeanio you can try pushing things with all those people that were waiting on this. Not sure we have all the docs yet but we do got the profile and confirmation so maybe that is enough to get things started while we finalize other stuff. Seems you have already started from what I see in telegram which is great!

We can explore getting on Indodax asap now too. No movement on exchanges for sometime so would be good to show community some results.


[12/09/2021 6:48 AM] Justin1000#9555
I don‚Äôt think I favor the EF buying ERGs myself. I tend to think the EF should focus on its core remit which is strictly the disbursement of ERGs for the advancement of Ergo. Buying Ergs would take us away from that and would consume time and resources.

I share concerns about current price of ERG and also think it is way undervalued. But that is what we think and the market is saying otherwise. We have obviously not succeeded yet in getting the ecosystem off the ground given how undervalued it is relative to other layer 1s.

So the purpose of getting in investors is to help on this. I have thought about it more and I support in principal selling 300k ERGs at 20% discount to the RIGHT investors even at today‚Äôs price. And there should be a 6-12 month lock-up which helps justify the discount (this could just go to a contract to be released right?).

What the investors could do is: 1) help build out tokenization of the ecosystem so help guide projects to how to tokenize and raise money and then those investors could lead investment rounds into those promising projects; 2) marketing‚Ä¶Harrington seems great here given Techcrunch; 3) provide funding ‚Äì even though the price is low, we are not giving these tokens away and the ~$1.5mm raised will be very useful; 4) provides a message to the entire ecosystem that VC funding is encouraged and projects should actively seek it out

Not sure about EF giving ERGs to them if they buy in secondary. In principal is okay with me. But seems more appealing to me to tell them we are more likely to be able to agree the sale of ERGs at 20% discount IF they also buy ERGs in market. I am thinking those investors will think a $1.5-2mm investment very small and might want to buy in secondary anyway.

[12/09/2021 6:53 AM] Justin1000#9555
Additionally:
*I am far more concerned about us not getting the ecosystem fully off the ground then I am of selling or spending too many ERGs at a cheap price. My reasoning is that if we do succeed in getting the ecosystem off the ground, then the price should easily be above >$100. Well, we still have 1.5mm ERGs in the treasury. Even if we disburse another 500k at today‚Äôs low prices, then that is 1mm ERGs which is $100mm+ if succeed. Given we have already gotten so far on such a tiny budget, I don‚Äôt think we will ever need $100mm so we are fine. 

*As to who the RIGHT investors are: I think Harrington is one. But ideally we would have 1 or 2 others in there with some geographical or other diversity. The problem is again I think they will see the investment as very small already so to further dilute it could be an issue.


[12/09/2021 6:58 AM] Justin1000#9555
**Ergopad: **Looks like they are doing a token sale starting today. I think is first one ever on Ergo right? If they are indeed going through with it and there are no obvious red flags, probably we should consider using our social media channels to get it some attention but I understand we don‚Äôt necessarily have 100% confidence in them so could add some disclaimer like they are not affiliated with EF and any investment at own risk or something.

But seems would be great to try and show them some support. Not only is first token sale (that I can recall) but is exactly what we need as they are going to help commericalize and tokenize the ecosystem! We need to move away from projects being done by hobbyists part time to one driven by people working full time for long term to make money.

I think we need to encourage and support more integrations. All kinds of integrations. Currently Ergo is present on Yahoo.finance, Trading View, CMC, coingecko, on different mining sites. But there are many other portals and platforms where Ergo is not among other tokens. 
Glassnode would be one such an example (https://glassnode.com/). 
It is good to have our own Ergo Watch project, but for bringing new people to Ergo it is much better to be present on Glassnode. And we can get off the ground only when more people start to notice Ergo, compare it with others etc.

Integrations is a whole direction of efforts and it will require a lot of money to push it forward. 
Basically, having a list of such platforms and an abundance of money we can spin-off separate integration project of each of them. And some of them may be quite expensive. To manage all this we need a lot of full-time people, and that means we  have to hire a lot, which will in turn increase our monthly payments. 
So, I don't think we have enough money even if ERG is $50 (10x from where we are) considering we no longer have ERGs from miners.

Thanks for sharing ideas!
I agree with what you said, how can I disagree? But, I think parts of my idea is misinterpreted by @Justin1000 and @glasgowm. I read my words again and seems it's my bad wording that resulted in that. So, let me try one more time to explain my point.

- I agree that we should be prepared for a 1-3 years bear market, and we should sell some Erg as soon as possible. Even at this price and even with discount (as @Justin1000 said).
- As you mentioned, investing of $1-2mm is a tiny investment for a big investor. That might result in less caring, attention, and effort from their side in the future too.
- The main point to my idea is that we are not the producer of ERG, miners are; also, selling EF Erg at bulk doesn't look like rug pulling? I think the fud on this can be painful. 
- we cannot absorb say $20mm of investment at all by selling Erg
- if we anticipate x amount of dollar by selling y amount of Erg at z ratio. Isn't it better to donate y/2 Erg to an investor who buys in the market, while selling the other y/2 in the market to him, probably at 2z ratio? 
- more advanced strategies can be useful here using the pairs of sigusd bank.
- Parts of this process can be done with the help of Kairon, like buying the ERG for the investor and selling EF coins.
- the whole saying of buying back Erg in the market for EF, was for the first investor. Considering we want 3 investors in a row, we do not have enough Erg to sell. unless we divide 300k Erg into 3 parts which does not make sense. At the end, we'll end up with selling 300k Erg and absorbing only $1.5mm.
- So in short, I think a good deal is to have the investor buy in the market while: donating him some Erg, selling the appropriate amount in the market, and using both sides of sigusd bank, at the same time.

Dear kushti
For purpose of compliance of Ergo Foundation now that it is incorporated, it is very important that Kim receives your couriered documents in the next 2 to 3 days.

Regulators need to record our (as Registered Filing Agent) obtaining of the CTC records within the given timeframe.¬† This is so as not to impact on Ergo Foundation as well.
¬†
Your action on this is very much appreciated.
¬†
Thanks,
Mr. Ching.

@kushti Please send this immediately overnight mail if possible.

This could be a issue for us incorporating.


[12/11/2021 4:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
**Need of Funding:** Yes, we definitely need funding as EF has very little USDT.

**Investment Size: **Yes, ~$1.5mm is small amount for investor. However, I am not so concerned that they will not be motivated. Else they wouldn‚Äôt make the investment in the first place and wouldn‚Äôt publicly announce it. Also, this is investment is just a high profile investment to get them into the door of the Ergo ecosystem so they can deploy many more millions in the coming years into projects built on Ergo. Whether we can have 2 or 3 investors in, probably have to see what the lead investor thinks. We should want this but if our top lead investor objects, then lets forget it and go with 1. If price gets to like $100 or whatever someday, we can do a bigger deal with more investors.

**Rug Pull: **I don‚Äôt think this is concern at all. We are just doing what we should for the ecosystem and it‚Äôs a tiny amount of money for crypto now days. Just need to explain the rational and the use of proceeds which given it isn‚Äôt that much anyway is easy‚Ä¶exchanges, marketing, salaries‚Ä¶etc. 

**Donation + Selling on Market: **Well if I understand correctly, then the idea is to give away some ERGs to investor and get them to build a bigger position on market and we sell into their buying and ultimately end up in a net better position. I don‚Äôt think I like this for multiple reasons:
-No lock-up
-Seems investor wouldn't like it and I think we should be fully transparent in what we are doing
-We should announce this whole deal and market it to the community. This structure seems difficult to market to them
-The investor can just do our deal and buy more on market to build a bigger position or just invest in projects on Ergo

I think we should just go with the tried and true sale to investor at good pricing with lock-up. So up to 300k ERGs, preferably 3 investors but only 1 or 2 if the lead objects, 20% discount. Ergs can go into a contract to be released to the investor gradually per block from 6 months to 12 months out so they got all the Ergs to do whatever they want with them in 1 year. And everything is announced and what they are going to do for Ergo is also announced and clearly communicated. So they are a partner and not just investor.

We can if armeanios discussions go well and harrington are interested.


[12/13/2021 7:46 AM] Justin1000#9555
I am really concerned about the soft fork myself. I think miners can be really short sighted and just plain stupid some times (thinking of some past Bitcoin experiences )  and may not come out in favor of it to extent necessary even though seems obvious to me its in their interest and important for long term network security too.

I saw Glasgow proposal for online voting which sounds good but concerned will backfire if we do it without having any idea result ahead of time as it will be public. If miners are really negative it will be hard to then reverse sentiment.

I am thinking the ideal situation would be to get a big mining pool out in favor publicly of the soft fork first. F2 pool would be the ideal one given their reputation and brand but they don't have much hashpower so I guess that makes nanominers the best choice. I think we should also be careful to just call this a "exploratory poll" or something and not imply this is a firm vote in case support is lackluster. 

If nanominers publicly supports it then it puts dissenters on defensive rather than proponents of soft fork.

[12/13/2021 11:06 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah the poll was posted as (non-binding/community sentiment) but I think it will struggle to pass as is. 

Results were that around a quarter of miners wanted to no-change to emission - and that's just from the ones that care enough to follow the community. 

From a network security perspective - would there not be plenty of time to pass this proposal? I imagine in the bear discussion is a bit more rational. 

From a price perspective - 100% of the mining rewards is ~10% of average daily volume, given that this is just a reduction of that, and a fraction of miners will hold. Seems like it'd be insignificant? 

At the moment it's unclear why 10 years was chosen initially (seems arbitrary?) and what changed to provoke these discussions. Armeanio made a comment about non-outsourceable puzzles being a factor but it's not clear how that would make storage rent less efficient. 

You'd also be diminishing one of the main appeals for a % of people and a bit of confidence. I think these discussions would go a lot better with the modelling kushti was talking about for storage rent with a re-emission contract with tx fees, etc bundled to smooth it along with some concrete numbers and charts.


[12/14/2021 4:27 AM] Justin1000#9555
Sorry, long winded thoughts on the soft-fork below‚Ä¶I think that:
-**Miners:** May not support it because of their short sightedness and fears over reduced profits ‚Äì good chance they would just look at fact the number of ERGs to them is lower in the short-term and not consider the likely higher price and positive feedback loop or even security threat.

-**Price Impact: **I think the reduced supply would have big positive impact on price, helping miners and the whole ecosystem tremendously. Yes, its not a huge amount as % of volume but a lot of that volume is fake and its also less ERGs outstanding so more $ chasing less Ergs and we saw from Bitcoin how big impact halving cycle has and the positive feedback loop.

-**Security Threat:** But I admit the price impact/feedback loop is not scientific and provable and is at best just a mitigant to some miner concerns. At end of day, everything revolves around the security issue - we should first determine if there is a network security issue and I think there is given adoption is not on track to be huge around year 4 which would correlate with the first storage rent payment at year 8. 

-If security issue, I think we and the community need to do something about it with or without the miners support but preferably with them through typical soft-fork mechanism.

-In hindsight 8 years was too short emission period but didn‚Äôt know how fast adoption would be at time and crypto market changing constantly.


[12/14/2021 4:28 AM] Justin1000#9555
-Would rather deal with this now than wait for bear market or something.

-If fork goes through, some miners may whine for a couple days but that is probably about all that would happen. Maybe I am overly pessimistic but I don‚Äôt trust them to do what is in interests of community and even themselves necessarily in relation to this kind of complicated soft fork but probably they will make best decisions on minor things like block size increases and block cost limits.

-We should not be too public about the security concerns I think so not a big fan of too many public graphs and detailed charts myself. It could send wrong message network is insecure and negatively impact sentiment, price and adoption. Rather we should just solve the problem.

-Your poll shows OVERWHELMING support at almost 90% for the soft-fork by the community. So I think we already got the mandate for us to aggressively pursue this fork whatever a few miners or mining pools think if there is indeed a security issue.


[12/14/2021 4:29 AM] Justin1000#9555
I am thinking the ideal way the Soft Fork would roll out would be:
-We establish there is a security threat or not.

-We go to Nanominers and tell them we need to adjust the admission to insure long-term security of the network and while it will reduce Ergs emitted in short-term, good chance it will have a ‚Äúhalvening effect‚Äù boosting price, adoption and long-term survability of network. In any case, we have no choice but to do it in order to address the security issue and that the community overwhelmingly supports it.

-We get their public support and signalling in favor of the soft-fork. With that in hand, go to the other pools and get them onboard. I think we need the top 5 pools. And try to get it done ASAP ‚Äì longer process goes on, more chance something derails. Think need 40+ days of voting just to get it through if I recall correctly.

-Proposal: We suggest to the miners the most conservative proposal of 12 ERGs / 18.55 years. I support a more aggressive one myself but this should at least mitigate the concerns of the <10% minority of general community who don‚Äôt support the fork and a higher % of miners don‚Äôt want to do it.


[12/14/2021 4:30 AM] Justin1000#9555
If miners don‚Äôt even support this conservative proposal despite overwhelming community support and the presence of security threat, then I think we should get the fork done another way, be it UASF or some other idea Kushti may have. Miners will bitch and moan for a day or two and that is about it. 

So hope we can get it done ASAP to resolve this overhanging issue and use the momentum of the community support.


[12/14/2021 4:33 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think we got pretty good relationship with 666 pool in China as we helped them resolve issues in past. Hopefully can get them on board. But everything probably needs to start with nanominers.


[12/14/2021 10:45 AM] glasgowm#9381
- I agree it will probably have a positive boost on my price, my concern is that in erg amounts I think the 20 year extension works out to about 5k erg less per day so that boost would be mostly from sentiment which is a bit fragile on the front-lines at the moment, especially in the mining community which is more emotive than the rest and still a bit salty from the difficulty which punishes loyal miners. 

```
Why would we want to cut 21 erg per block out of mining rewards to add onto a tail for 30 years when the idea of the blockchain is that transaction fees and storage fees are supposed to provide consistent returns after the 8 years are up. That's a crazy amount almost 30% reduction in yields...

Its like the whole mining difficulty thing all over again "this is better for you because we say it is even through the math says you'll make significantly less even before factoring compounding from hodling"
```

considering we've potentially got farms who got ahold of millions of erg before the HF, and potentially other vocal whales who may oppose this strongly (like chris ray from ergolend) - I'd be concerned one dump could negate any benefit.

But I think the miners could still be swayed. At the moment the issue is there is unanswered questions. Not clear how adoption has impacted this decision.  We can see the UTXO state growth is ~800k for this year, was this expected to be higher or were alternative solutions like ErgoData and sidechain fees expected to be more prominent by now? I think a detailed post by @kushti explaining this is needed - or alternatively, if the timing is mostly due to selling pressure and trying to increase price to try and capitalise on the bull run - the community would also be fine with that. Should also lay out a plan on further discussion that'll take place and highlight previous ones (to demonstrate these things are always in flux and not set in stone). 

Would also be interested in hearing @mhs_sam's opinion as he's closest to the mining community.


[12/14/2021 10:50 AM] glasgowm#9381
If worded correctly and the right investor I dont think there'd be too much pushback from the community on this. There's even some sentiment that the EF should've took a little bit of funding or more ergs to make it less of an uphill battle.


[12/14/2021 11:29 AM] mhs_sam#1471
I agree with Justin and you with a few comments:
- Miners (GPU holders) are not important in this case. The vast majority of them mine the most profitable coin and switch network easily. The ones who matter are the mining pools. They can dictate what to do and miners will obey.
- Miners cannot understand what's the result of this decision. Ones who do not obey the SF will go to other pools (pools not supporting the fork) or will leave the network for a while which is not concerning.
- it is not concerning since the price will go up with a good marketing on this decision and the mining profit will go up too. So, new miners will come. 
- The main difference with Bitcoin is that bitcoin miners use asic and ours use gpu. GPU miners mostly follow the best daily income. So, we might lose some current miners but we will obtain new ones. It depends on the mining profit not the mining reward in erg.

- to summarize, no need to hesitate for miner's decision. we should contact mining pools and obtain their support.
- I'm not sure if the starting point is nanominer since they was very aggressive in the previous hardfork. Any deal should satisfy nanominer but I think we should go to some pools at the same time.

- I think the time for gathering community opinions in past. We should decide on only and only ONE proposal without any options and market it to pools. (a proposal with different rewards and different emission period will signal hesitancy).
- some miners will oppose that and they might be a lot. but their hashrate might be much lower than their voices.
- So we should go confident and fast. the more time it takes the more hesitancy in the market. 
- at the end, I agree with justin that if it is good for network which it is, we should pass it even with something like UASF.

- at the end, it really depends on us and how to market it. we should be fast, confident, and with right signal to the community (holders and users, not miners)

Might be easier to convince multiple pool's if we first get support from a big lead pool like nanominer.  Pools B, C, etc. should be more likely to go along knowing that  we already have support from pool A.

To save time on call, here are the things occurred to me to mention on call:

**Wallets** - Yoroi was supposed to be "metamask" for Ergo but seems to be a big dissapointment and wallets are absolutely key for a smart contract platform. I would have thought Emurgo would have plenty of resources for Yoroi especially given its importance to Ergo but they don't seem to care enough. 

Should we look to expand support for other wallets to find a real "metamask" for Ergo and a good alternative to Yoroi? Should we consider a grant to Nautilus if they deliver a good first effort? If price goes >$20, perhaps we can find a big wallet Company to do a good wallet for Ergo and pay them a lot of money to keep it maintained.

**Privacy Hackathon marketing **- Should consider how to market this aggressively to get most uptake. Can we target privacy coin communities like Monero, Pirate Chain, ZCash etc? 

What are we going to make the $ award this time?


[12/21/2021 12:12 PM] Justin1000#9555
**ErgoDEX funding - Prelim thoughts:**
-I initially like Armeanio's idea (if I understand it correctly) of the EF giving them a grant and them awarding the community with a token issuance to a community-driven DAO. This kicks off the DAO, sets the precedent for other projects to follow and generates interest and discussion in the community. This way we also don't need to consider for now at least the investment policy issues.

-No problem in principal giving them a grant/investment given all they have done and fact we know them well and have high level of confidence in them.

-But I am not sure they are approaching this right. The proposal to the Foundation should be about assuring us after the grant funds them for 1 quarter, they are going to be in a position to fund themselves for the years to come and they may well need something like a million from VCs / seed investors etc over multiple rounds.

There is no point to the Foundation giving them a grant for development and marketing for 3 months so they can be broke at the end of it. So I would want to see the proposal more focused on:
-how they are going to get incorporated (if they need that for further funding)
-token sale plans and how funding for the 3 months is going to position them well for VC funding
-are they going to need to hire a lawyer for something?

Maybe they can work with Ergopad. 

They mention "fair" distribution which is okay but I don't think need to be overly focused on that. Just get the funding and get some good name backers for the dex so it gets off the ground and has money for marketing and development going forward! Nothing wrong with launching for-profit a business on Ergo. Should be commercial...


[12/21/2021 1:11 PM] morphic#4133
Regarding Wallets issues. We recently discussed plans for ergo-wallet-app with Benjamin. He is now moving it towards a truly cross platform app with single code base (for everything except UI). 
The first goal is to have 70-80% of the code fully reusable across platforms (Android, iOS, MacOS, Linux, Windows).
The second goal is to enable Plugins inside the wallet app and provide something like Wallet Plugin SDK for developers to implement dApp specific UI and logic.
The third goal, and probably most interesting, once the plugins are possible in the wallet app, Benjamin will implement what can be  called Universal Plugin, which will load the high-level declarative specification of how it should behave and implement it. This specification will be a high level domain-specific language for UI and transaction logic. This is not set in stone, but this would enable a wallet platform similar to metamask.

This however doesn't address the issue with in-browser wallet, which is necessary to have.

[12/22/2021 2:05 AM] mhs_sam#1471
"Each datapoint on the graph represents the preceding 24 hours, except for the last one showing current total since previous datapoint."

if accumulated from 26-27, seems to me that it is the accumulated amount of ERG in lots of failed tx for buying SigRSV/USD. I cannot remember why, but my wallet history shows successful SigRSV mint in the 3rd attempt. It means that I have send x ERG and received x ERG in each try, resulting in 6x value. It might be the same for lots of users.


[12/22/2021 2:07 AM] mhs_sam#1471

Now that we have published the soft fork, can we prepare a workaround for sth like UASF? @kushti


[12/23/2021 5:46 AM] Justin1000#9555
What is best way to get a professional ppt done for Ergo that we can use for potential investors and partners? I keep getting asked for one. Me and Noah can sponsor it if a community bounty or something would be good. I think should include comprehensive intro to Ergo and its ethos which we don't need to change on ongoing basis and in addition some easily updatable metrics. I got past presentations from '17-'19 but they are far from fit for this purpose.

[12/23/2021 6:45 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah, my opinion also we should have UASF solution given overwhelming support by community and I am still pessimistic miners will make this happen. So hopefully Kushti has some ideas there.

But first should we give the miners full chance to support it? It would be big win for Ergo governance if they can take a constructive long-term view and also get onboard with what the community wants.

I am thinking we should approach the 666 (the Chinese pool) and F2pool and get them to publicly support the soft fork. And other pools too of course. Even if we ultimately need to do UASF, it would be good I think to get miner public support for the fork as high as possible. Hopefully they will come around and pass it with onchain voting‚Ä¶afterall it isn‚Äôt in their interest for the community to do a UASF instead of them supporting what the community wants.

[12/24/2021 3:25 PM] Justin1000#9555
Would be great if F2pool could come out publicly in support and strongly. Would be good for them too because even though they are a smaller pool at moment they are great brand and this would help them gain visibility in the community

Eva thinks no problem for 666 to make announcement. She will draft one. She asked F2pool and didn‚Äôt get any pushback. Probably they will accept it but haven't got clear answer yet.

Can‚Äôt we just tell the other pools to support it and finish this off? The miners are not in a position to go against the will of the community or the core devs judgement. I don‚Äôt have contacts for the other pools.

This is not about reducing supply and pumping the price but about security. We need to insure the long-term security of the network. If not, people may not even wait for the end of 8 years to find out if the network is going to secure but will stop building on and investing in Ergo now.

Think the community discussions and polling are already sufficient if you guys can get the other pools on board. Should just tell them we need to do it for long-term security. Don‚Äôt think necessarily should be humbly asking the pools their opinion at this point.


[12/28/2021 4:14 PM] Justin1000#9555
Eva would prefer if nanopool and herominers would announce at same time as 666. she said didn't get any push back from 666 at all and doesn't think should be a big problem - I also don't see on what basis the miners are going to oppose the core devs and broader community on this. Better for everyone and a win for Ergo governance if they support it.

Hey guys, belated Merry (western) Christmas/happy new years. As I mentioned a month or so ago I chatted with @kushti about officially being out of the foundation. I think the new year is a good mark for me to be out, and since I am not contributing I don't feel like it's right for me to see behind the scenes and also vote on proposals any longer. I leave it up to you guys if you want to make it an announcement or have this be discrete and not mention it publicly loudly so as to not cause a stir (as I know you have enough problems with the fork already).


[12/28/2021 11:13 PM] Robert K#0722

My thoughts are to not make an announcement about it.


[12/29/2021 3:01 AM] Justin1000#9555
Probably no need to make an announcement. If do make one I think it should be part of a bigger announcement on Foundation stuff including something positive.  

Thanks for all the work with Ergo.


[12/29/2021 8:34 AM] Justin1000#9555
Eva started telegram chats with Woolypooly, 666, k1, HeroMiners, Leafpool, EnigmaPool, Getblok. She said Woolypooly also said they support the SF.

But I will hold off for now on discussions until there is some consensus on how we are approaching this.


[12/29/2021 8:48 AM] Justin1000#9555
So in addition to 666, Woolypooly and F2pool, need to get **nanopool + herominers **and either one of 2miners or flypool and that should be sufficient.


[12/29/2021 9:07 AM] Justin1000#9555
Herominers said "would continue to support Ergo" when Eva mentioned soft fork to them -> probably means will support soft fork. if so that means likely just need nanopool assuming can get either 2miners or flypool as well.


[12/29/2021 11:07 AM] glasgowm#9381
I've made a private channel #pool-operators (figure it'd be useful in future even if we approach individual this time) that has the following people.  (see image below)

Nano the main one missing obviously as they left the server when people were accusing them of hash inflation. Seems they were hostile to the last HF, running a private mining farm (?) - so maybe @kushti better speaking to them directly? 

We also need a place for people to delegate hash too in order to vote No or it'll be chaos. I've asked GetBlok if they think they'll be able to do PoW-backed voting in time for the vote. If not I guess one would appear naturally if there was demand? 

Still a bit unclear when the actual vote begins. Is it -40 days from that proposed block the change would be implemented in the EIP?

GetBlok.io said
```
Possibly. We‚Äôre testing payouts right now in test net with smart contracts integrated. Give me a day or two to get through that with the team and I will have a better idea.
```

Unrelated to this but if ErgoPads next round sells out they will have raised $1m SigUSD total. Then next step is putting some of that in LP on ErgoDex. So we should have some help on the development front soon. Their first IDO is being announced on the 2nd.


[12/29/2021 4:06 PM] Justin1000#9555
2miners probably will support as they said: "I don't understand exactly what are you asking for. Usually a coin developers just decide to make a hard/soft fork and don't give a f*ck what do miners think."

This response doesn't surprise me much...I don't think miners generally like to take a view on these things...


[12/29/2021 4:09 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah...ErgoPad could bring a lot. also this begs the question why ErgoDEX is having funding problems given they are the highest profile project on Ergo. But I don't envy them having to deal with regulations around token sale and stuff. Probably they can raise the funds they need easily but I would still support Foundation giving them some "bridging" funding especially if they fund the community DAO.


[12/29/2021 8:27 PM] Armeanio#0321
Cheers, if there is ever any overlap in the future let us know.


[12/29/2021 8:32 PM] Armeanio#0321
We are waiting for a final grant request from Ergodex. 

I have put them in touch with a firm to help guide them as they tokenize. 

Regarding VC Funding they seriously need to improve their offer and and message if they are going to be interesting. I am trying to work with them in this regard, mixed results so far.  

I proposed they put 2% of their allocation towards bootstrapping a community development DAO. Let's see what their latest writeup looks like when it comes.

Very indicatively already got 50% for the Fork. If Nanopool comes along, mostlikely will be ~90%. Eva is trying to add him to the Nanopool telegram group but he his privacy settings are hindering it.


[12/31/2021 7:57 AM] Justin1000#9555
We shouldn't be using that pool operators group chat to discuss the fork because the operators will feed off any doubts in their and make the chance of fork passing much lower. should pursue them in the telegram groups we got set up.


[12/31/2021 7:57 AM] Justin1000#9555
Should look to get basically all the pools on board with it. The "vocal" miners who really oppose it for whatever reason I guess can switch to getblok or something. Hopefully won't be too many of those.

[01/03/2022 5:36 AM] Justin1000#9555
Seems to have some reservations about methodology but in end I guess this means he will support the soft-fork. Will see if they have any other feedback. So this would be 90% but 1) we really need to get Flypool on board too I think; 2) everything is indicative to-date so when the soft fork is announced and voting instructions given we need to chase them up to get their firm committment and get it reflected on chain.


[01/03/2022 5:37 AM] Justin1000#9555
I really don't believe we should use the # pool operators for this because if any miner raises concerns, it might inspire the same concerns in the other miner or make the miner think the soft-fork won't go through so they shouldn't bother supporting it. We should speak to each miner individually in the telegram groups we have set up. We got groups with everyone but Flypool...still need them.

[01/03/2022 3:16 PM] Justin1000#9555
Flypool: "Hey, we have not had a moment to ask our miners what they would like, however we are generally in favor of the idea." - seems positive. F2pool has yet to confirm. But if all those prelim indications come out on-chain in favor, would be ~98% of hash power. But easily could have a reversal or two.

I understand you want to leave an outlet for the miners who feel strongly to vote no. I hope we don‚Äôt over promote that though myself so as to maximize the chance of the soft fork being adopted. I think pretty much all the major pools need to support it given the extremely high threshold of 90% to pass and allowing for some miners to switch to a no vote pool. I think it will be a huge win for all parts of Ergo ecosystem if the soft fork goes through successfully through on-chain voting by miners.

We now have telegram chats with all the major pools.


[01/03/2022 3:37 PM] glasgowm#9381
The sentiment is pretty much supermajority in agreement but not having an outlet for people to vote no could flip that (especially with ergo's audience). Thankfully looks like GetBlok will have some sort of token voting system ready so no pools will need to be opposed. 

I imagine they'll get some interest for the novelty but doubtful the subsection of people who would vote No and also care enough to switch pools would come near 10%

[01/03/2022 5:15 PM] Justin1000#9555
Well we will see what feedback comes back from pools but I am not expecting much. Miners may not even care that much and many will just flip from coin to coin mining where they see the most profit. They certainly almost never have the sort of dedication and involvement in a protocol the core dev team will have. Hence why miners should normally give huge weight to what the core devs think and I think why basically all the pools were predisposed to favor the fork.

I think can be viewed as a test of Ergo governance which gives a heavy weighting to what miners think. Can they put the long-term interest of the protocol above short-term calculations they plug into a model like the block reward #? If so, it not only largely solves the long-term security threat, but increases confidence in the protocol which matters big times to builders and investors. And it shows a promising future for miner driven governance. So I think miners need to step up here and vote to reduce their own short-term rewards which will be huge positive for the whole ecosystem.

I‚Äôve always been pessimistic because in my experience going back to segwit and UASF etc with Bitcoin. But overall seems better so far with this debate on Ergo but that 90% threshold is so high‚Ä¶I dunno.

Anyway, will see if more feedback but I am not expecting too much from them. Son of a Tech‚Äôs uninformed rant just now certainly will not help either!

The codebases of Ergo and Ada seems to be fully disjoint. I'm not 100% sure, but I expect them to be very different. So changes in Ergo code doesn't always translate directly to Ada changes. We don't want anon_br to jump into this rabbit hole.
I don't think it is reasonable asking to fix (or even investigate) possible Ada problems on the grounds of fixes done in Ergo.
And, this is not just about money, time is more important. We have a lot of tasks for anon_br to do on the Ergo part basically ASAP. 
It is better to let the Yoroi devs to know, that anon_br is working on Ergo code only, so they cannot ask him to do anything in Ada code. This was part of the initial agreement between EF and Emurgo. 
He can still do changes in the common code (which is used in both Ergo and Ada), but only to facilitate development of Ergo support.

However, conversely, one can also see an argument that each of the Howey prongs can potentially be satisfied for a negative outcome i.e. classification as a security:

miners expend energy and incur opportunity cost to mine the tokens, and secondary market investors spend money to buy them on exchanges, thus constituting an investment of money
because they token has a market price, and the incentives of the foundation and the users are aligned, there is most likely horizontal and vertical commonality
as the network grows, purchasers of the token might reasonably expect the tokens to grow in value, leading to profits, and
that profitability, at this point, is arguably dependant on the efforts of the Ergo Foundation to promote further development, the creation of applications, marketing, etc.
 

If we are to aim for classification of ERG as a non-security, we need to target the last prong, as that is the one angle that we normally go for in order to build our arguments. In order to build a valid argument, we will need as detailed a set of information as possible on how important the foundation is to the growth of the token's ecosystem. Please provide us with such information, after which we will be able to confirm whether:

 

We can deliver a final legal opinion on the basis of a ‚Äúbalance of probabilities‚Äù that ERG is not a security (the highest level of confirmation that we can provide for US-based legal opinions); or
We can deliver a final legal opinion stating that there may be a basis on which to conclude that ERG is not a security, but not to the level of a ‚Äúbalance of probabilities‚Äù

Current Block height is 658938.  
New emission rules will be applied on top of current emission at block height 699393
40,455 Blocks from right now until the SF would go into effect
Roughly 720 Blocks are found per day
40,455/720 = 56 Days remaining until SF initiates 
The voting for soft-fork lasts for 32 epochs (32,768 blocks ~ 46 days), 90+% support is needed to activate the protocol upgrade.
This means the Voting for Soft fork will start approximately 01.17.2022

sound about right?

also in the article by @Armeanio :

Why? majority is 50%+1 (or simply 51%), supermajority could be 75%.
btw, why even supermajority is needed and not majority?


[01/11/2022 10:52 AM] mhs_sam#1471
And it is vague somehow, the soft fork will be activate by majority(51%), right?
Getblock is doing an inside voting, so if +90% of its voters vote yes, getblock will vote yes? I'm a bit confused on that.
Also, I saw in the chats that this 90% is considered for activating soft fork, which I think is not right?

All your comments seem fair, I think 6% should be fine for VCs but probably best to check first. I don't think the community would make too much noise at 70-75% - probably have a harder time legally later on the less public tokens too I imagine?

Their plan is to rebrand yeah - not sure if the name is final. I think Spectrum was one of the better options but prepare for the autism jokes. To be fair to them they've got a telegram with a ton of community members in it going through potential names and there's just too many DeFi things in the space - every name is taken.


[01/11/2022 11:35 AM] glasgowm#9381
How's this looking now? Nanopool have said they'd support the devs regardless right?

More details in sheet above. This is very indicative! Just based on interpertation of their comments. I think I should go back to them and ask them to confirm now they have had time to consider more.


[01/11/2022 2:27 PM] Justin1000#9555
So vote will start approximately 1 week from now right? Block 666,625, 32,768 blocks before 699,393 mentioned in EIP as new emission start (I think the actual emission doesn't change till 32,768 blocks later though to account for activation period).


[01/11/2022 2:39 PM] Justin1000#9555
Think miners need detailed step-by-step instructions on how to vote. I see ‚Äúonly mining nodes will need to update‚Äù will need to update for soft-fork but I am unsure if that is during the voting period or during activation period (I guess activation). Anyway they will need details on voting and upgrading.

Yeah, 90% super high. But it is what is built-in I understand and what was in the Ergo white paper. Not sure anyway to reduce it. Above is just some of the old bitcoin discussions. Miner-led governance didn't work in 2017 so the users had to activate Segwit. Maybe in Ergo a little easier because community smaller or just smarter.

One other thing: is anyone aware of significant hash power of miners outside pools? If any we should approach them separately ahead of the fork.


[01/11/2022 5:29 PM] Armeanio#0321
I pulled that from one of the original ergo docs.


[01/11/2022 5:31 PM] Armeanio#0321
Can we make a similar document public?


[01/11/2022 5:57 PM] mhs_sam#1471
Yeah, that's clear now. I was missing that wp info.


[01/11/2022 6:28 PM] Justin1000#9555
That one is too tentative. Think need to circle back up with each one for a confirmation on their current thinking.


[01/12/2022 5:16 AM] Justin1000#9555
Hi @kushti -  The feedback above on the soft-fork from the pools is just tentative. I need to go back and ask the pools to confirm if they are voting in favor of the fork. But I can‚Äôt just ask them‚Ä¶I need to tell them some new info at same time. Just a few short bullets is fine. Can you confirm the below:
**
*Voting will commence on schedule on block 666,625 (699,393 ‚Äì 32,768) which is expected to start on next Tuesday (~6.6 days from now), correct?

*You will provide detailed specific instructions to pools on process, correct? On what day can you provide these instructions?**

That is probably all I need to know to ask them their final views. If you want, you can let me know if they will need to upgrade their node ahead of the vote? Or if they just need to upgrade their node between blocks 699,393 and 732,161 during the activation period? But these details not really needed for this purpose.


[01/12/2022 6:07 PM] Armeanio#0321
We have enough information to meet the balance of probabilities threshold of ERG not constituting a security under US law and can therefore proceed with the drafting of the legal opinion.¬†

[01/16/2022 4:13 AM] Justin1000#9555
Is the vote going ahead per schedule and do miners know how to vote? Don't think I have seen any update?

I asked Kushti above but didn't hear anything. Happy to ask miners in the telegrama to confirm though...


[01/16/2022 5:00 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti I just want to make sure everything is on schedule and miners either know how to vote or will be told before vote starts before we go back to mining pools and ask them to confirm their position. Else we can annoy them, lose credibility etc and make this all harder.  Some pools already asked before how to vote so apparently don't know.


[01/16/2022 5:39 AM] Justin1000#9555
Not the best way to be doing this but given running out of time I asked them anyway in the telegram chats. Lets see what they say.


[01/16/2022 3:12 PM] mhs_sam#1471
idk if this makes any difference but...
maybe we can arrange the voting in such a way that saying NO requires to do something. And if a miner wants to say Yes, he simply does nothing.


[01/16/2022 4:04 PM] Justin1000#9555
Might be good. Nanominers complained the process was too hard. 

But still...if any of the pools has strong feeling against fork they would still vote no so probably it is good idea as long as noone is strongly against fork else still have to convince them or it won't pass. Haven't heard back from Nanopool and 2miners...


[01/16/2022 4:41 PM] Armeanio#0321
The sooner we can get the voting info public the better imo.


[01/16/2022 5:52 PM] glasgowm#9381
That's what it'll probably end up being. Stay on your current pool to vote Yes - or switch to GetBlok and use the vote tokens there.

Might be a good idea if workable. Nanopool and 2miners haven't yet responded. Both seemed supportive of fork but not too keen on participating in a complicated process. Maybe they will give some feedback today.

[01/19/2022 3:47 AM] Justin1000#9555
Its "rough" but maybe the way needs to be done at this stage in Ergo's development. Miners are not accustomed to Ergo‚Äôs miner-led governance as other chains don‚Äôt do it. And they aren‚Äôt incentivized to heavily to participate given Ergo is still small and a small % of their business so they don‚Äôt care that much. 

All the pools basically said they support the fork to various degrees. Some like nanopool and 2miners and possibly Herominers etc basically implied they may not want to participate in actual vote though. Vote for yes by default is inline with community support for fork and addresses the miners‚Äô concern about actively participating in the process.

Miner-led governance will just have to be something to work on in future but going to be hard to make real progress until Ergo is much bigger.

So can see how this goes‚Ä¶ideally the miners do proactively vote yes‚Ä¶but if not I think what @mhs_sam  suggests does make sense in this case.


[01/19/2022 3:53 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think if get above 50% here probably just proceed with soft fork and ask them to update their nodes as we already discussed this with all the pools and they said okay with fork and seems they will all be happy to upgrade. If don't even get above 50%, shows miners are basically refusing to participate so should proceed with new vote with Yes by default.


[01/19/2022 5:38 AM] Armeanio#0321
I think if we don't reach consensus we shouldn't proceed. 

It would be interesting to start running a vote where miners have to vote in favor. 

If it fails we run a second vote where miners need to vote against. 

That would demonstrate engagement. 

Even if we fail the first vote, it also is a teaching moment about Ergo and miner driven governance. 

Luckily this isn't an immediately critical issue. 

If we just forced the soft fork without consensus we could take massive reputation damage most likely long term, and imo that loss of trust isn't worth the gain.


[01/19/2022 10:02 AM] glasgowm#9381
I think if it's just 2Miners who aren't even opposed but abstaining then the community would be okay with opt-in voting. Also feel like 2Miners could be convinced tho. 

It's nano that's the unknown tho - what mediums have we reached out over? Should I try and get in contact via their twitter ? 

GetBlok also hasn't fully implemented PoV yet so atm there's no option to vote No. Think anon_real is helping them out now.


[01/19/2022 12:09 PM] Justin1000#9555
We already have consensus as can be shown by community polling and feedback from mining pools which all seemed fine with it. Closest thing I saw to negative was 2miners last night and that was probably not well thought out and Kushti thought they would come around. Even Son of a Tech said had to do it in his last video because no choice! Doubt we will ever have more consensus about anything and that goes for a revised even more conservative proposal.

The problem is how to get that consensus reflected on to the blockchain via voting and then communicated to the community. But no surprise having difficulty. Segwit in Bitcoin in 2017 was also had broad community support (probably not as much as this Ergo SF though!) but at the time there was tons of fud and misinformation and miners for various reasons did not support it enough so the users had to activate it.

It seems some pools maybe are telling us to get lost and they don‚Äôt want to vote. If they continue to do that then will never get to 90% and maybe not even >50%. So asking the pools to vote no if they feel strongly is a pretty good compromise.


[01/19/2022 12:10 PM] Justin1000#9555
I think this is a critical and urgent issue indeed. Maybe if we hadn‚Äôt raised it to the community, could have ignored it for a while longer but now its out of the bag. This uncertainty about the long-term security and sustainability of the network will massively raise the risk premium for investing and developing on Ergo. This will in turn make the problem even more acute. And I am not optimistic there is another solution anyway:

-Even if take all the transaction fees, burns, storage rent, side chain fees to year 8 and put them into the re-emission contract, can we be sure that will be enough? If not for sure, then have same problem as above where people don‚Äôt know if Ergo will be around in a few years so why bother to build on it?

-More importantly, unlikely to have higher support for any alternative proposal then this one and will have same exact problem of getting the miners to vote! Basically the pools all implied supported the fork‚Ä¶but some are hesitant to vote because they don't want to take a view.


[01/19/2022 12:10 PM] Justin1000#9555
It would be great for this to work with the 90% threshold but it would also be surprising and I don‚Äôt see why Ergo should hold itself to some standard that even Bitcoin couldn‚Äôt meet.

And in future when Ergo is booming and secure and this problem is resolved, no one will care or talk about it negatively except a few random fud monsters!

You can check the telegram group Ergo+Nanopool - they seemed fine with it "Hello everyone and Happy New Year!
We do not mind changing the distribution of rewards to support longer mining, but we would like it to be done in an easier way. We are still researching information on the soft fork and its consequences.
In any case, we are going to accept any changes approved by the developers and published on the official ergo github site.

But i think Kushti said they don't even bother to update their node sometimes so might not be bothered to vote.

[01/27/2022 11:30 AM] glasgowm#9381
Hero seemed pretty supportive in the chat? Even indicated their support on the forum.


[01/27/2022 12:42 PM] Justin1000#9555
They communicated this to you separately? Based on what I see in the Telegram chats and forum:
*Nanopool: Don‚Äôt care about the fork. They said supported it but they wanted an ‚Äúeasier‚Äù way. This and fact they have not voted implies to me they are happy for fork to happen but don‚Äôt plan to do anything to show support because they don‚Äôt care.

*Herominers: Said would do what community and miners want. Posted this in the forum. While that implies they would vote for the fork, the fact they are not voting tells me likely they just want to make an ambiguous statement to deflect their responsibility and then do nothing (similar to nanopool).

*2miners: In the telegram they mentioned some misguided misgivings. 

We already got ~90% of community saying they support it? What more can they want?


[01/27/2022 12:42 PM] Justin1000#9555
In my opinion, while it was incredibly important to stimulate the impartial debate in the community and very good work everyone did there, we cannot be sure miners will vote to put into effect the community consensus. Should keep trying for now as it would be big win to get that miner vote at >90% but should also have a contingency plan to implement the soft fork even if miners don‚Äôt vote >90%. I don‚Äôt think there will ever be more community consensus for anything and this is EXTREMELY important for Ergo. The most important thing going on by far right now!

I actually suspect some of the long winded arguments against the fork were done by hostile backers of other PoW chains but I am just guessing. In any case I don‚Äôt see how we could expect to get higher consensus for another proposal as this is obviously the best option and people would probably be highly disappointed if we can‚Äôt even implement this!

Also I note all the problems with nodes and stuff miners are having. Given all that miners typically have to deal with, to expect them to step up and take proactive role in implementing the community consensus here may be a bit much.


[01/27/2022 2:33 PM] Justin1000#9555
Just based on what I see in the telegrams, the next steps would be to:
*Nanopool ‚Äì Push them to vote yes. They already said they would support it so we should pressure them heavily to get them to reflect this!
*Herominers ‚Äì Same as nanopool.
*2miners ‚Äì Address the concerns they raised and emphasize the community support and tell them to vote yes!

But I guess you have had separate conversations so perhaps above is not best approach?

For Getblock, it seems fine to publicize their voting tokens and make people aware of it but please do not imply in doing so it‚Äôs a good thing to vote against the fork!! Given the extremely strong community support and the importance of this fork, the best way forward here is a default yes vote achieved by all pools supporting it but a way to vote no for the miners who feel very strongly through Getblock.io as that will be good for Ergo‚Äôs long term governance and miner involvement.

If that doesn‚Äôt work should consider other ways to activate the fork although I admit it poses a PR challenge.

votes so far on GetBlok.io

Is making it opt-out going to bring a lot of FUD? Pools aren't explicitly opposed but are refusing to vote so this path seems reasonable to me and the most painless way for it to pass. 

Agree the issue is 'out' now and not sure prolonging discussions will help. But also feel the community is still a bit uneasy/confused. I've plugged in set growth to the storage rent formula and can see the need for the SF. But one questions i can't answer even after digging through all the chat logs is why 8 years @kushti ? Only response is that you wanted ~100M coins in ~10 years. But given the storage rent takes from -4 years, seems very ambitious lol. 

Was this based on BTCs historical growth and where you thought the crypto space / tech would be by now?

[02/08/2022 3:20 PM] Justin1000#9555
Probably given the overwhelming community support, there wouldn‚Äôt be much FUD from it. Maybe a few people would bitch and moan. Guess they can get lost and go to Ravencoin or some other garbage.

I feel as though the soft fork uncertainty is a depressing haze across the entire ecosystem. Price is crap despite all the good developments lately and surely adoption is being hindered even though there is a lot of encouraging progress. But hopefully can resolve this as soon as possible.

Kushti would have to answer as to why 8 years specifically. But I would note:
-Adoption probably been slower than expected. This can mainly be explained by centralized VC-backed layer 1s taking up the mindshare. Ergo was built for total decentralization and a hostile environment that hasn‚Äôt materialized at all yet (But seems inevitable ultimately)
-Ergo was meant to be adaptable. We are actually in a really enviable position here that can change the emission schedule with a soft fork and without increasing total supply! Bitcoiners don‚Äôt like to talk about it but BTC could be facing same but much more serious challenge as its not clear the transaction fees are going to be sufficient to maintain the network when the block subsidy reduces. Are they going to have to do a hard fork and break the sacred 21mm coin limit? I guess good chance they will in the end (maybe they can say the fork is supplying the ‚Äúlost‚Äù coins back to the market).


[02/08/2022 3:20 PM] Justin1000#9555
So I don‚Äôt know why people even care about the ‚Äúwhy 8 years‚Äù. Fact is Ergo was meant to be adaptable and is able to fix this situation and we have overwhelming support to do so.


[02/08/2022 3:20 PM] Justin1000#9555
The pools didn‚Äôt even respond to my telegram. If @kushti has no way to convince them then I think should either:

-Just implement the soft fork without a further vote on the back of the extreme support among miners and community despite a few pools not showing any willingness to participate in the process. Even Getblock has it at 94% support!


-Make vote opt out. Don‚Äôt need to make big deal about it‚Ä¶just announce it in the forum, post instructions and inform pools and then implement soft fork. Don‚Äôt even need to say a %. Probably opt out will be far less than 10% but at least if it happens to come out like 12 or 15% or something we can have some leeway to do soft fork anyway.

üíØ 

[02/08/2022 3:35 PM] mhs_sam#1471
I agree with almost any sentence. But I did not get what you mean by making vote opt out and the rest of it.
I think if the vote is Yes by default, we will overcome the pool's hesitancy and lack of support. So anyone that wants to say NO must do something, others should do nothing to vote yes.
I think if we go with default No, we will lose this voting even with 99% support.

At the end, pools simply don't care as much as we care about it. They are always being forced by the dev teams to activate forks without any chance of saying No. Things are different with ASIC mining coins (btc for example), since miners have skin in the game. But with gpu mining, miners regularly change the network without any commitment to a chain. 

Tbh, I have no regret if the vote is ending with No, IF we have an option to activate it by UASF. In this case, the fork will be more aggressive to miners.


[02/08/2022 3:42 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah I took "opt-out" to mean making YES for EIP27 the default vote and anyone who wants to vote no would have to adjust their config. Yes probably would be like 99%. Hope we can do it ASAP!

Yeah if some reason vote comes out no i would support a more aggressive UASF.

So we are on same page.

Crypto‚Äôs use as currency will only be possible following proper identity checks via the country‚Äôs banking system or licensed intermediaries while operations exceeding R 600,000 ($8,016) must be declared, according to the document.

Transacting outside those proposed legal parameters will be considered a criminal offense and fines are expected to be introduced for the illegal acceptance of cryptos as a means of payment.

Took a look and seems Herominers, woolypooly, 2miners still not supporting fork on chain. 2miners I presume just need a little more time.

For herominers and woolypooly I messaged them in telegram. Woolypooly said would do soon. Herominers hasn't responded.yet.

@kushti please stay on top of 2miners and get them to update config. Would be nice to get.to the >90pct threshold and these 3 pools should do it

So will be ~95% once Herominers, Woolypool and 2miners update config. current status:

-2miners ‚Äì have told Kushti will support. @kushti, please ask them to update as soon as practical.
-Woolypool ‚Äì said would support and would take a look at editing config later today.


[02/13/2022 11:59 AM] glasgowm#9381
Does this vote matter? Only indicative and likely failed since it's not been at above 90% the majority of the time? 

Might be better waiting until the real vote to get them to do things it it requires another update ?


[02/13/2022 12:29 PM] Justin1000#9555
Can't we just use this? Hard enough to get them to vote once. If reaches above 90 I would hope good enough when combined with the overwhelming community support. Think in interest of time we should just activate it after this vote when testing done.


[02/13/2022 6:43 PM] kushti#0978
I think after getting 90 percent in this poll we can provide a new release with EIP27 flag, and 1 epoch voting before activation


[02/13/2022 6:43 PM] kushti#0978
We need to postpone activation a bit likely

[02/15/2022 12:58 PM] Justin1000#9555
I don‚Äôt fully understand. But I would make following points:
-Completing whatever vote and locking in activation is the priority. The actual timing of the activation is less important but think we need to lock in the vote ASAP while have community support and focus.
-If the mining pools needs to vote again and change config again, then there is obviously some risk >10% don‚Äôt do it because of the hassle. Possible ways to mitigate this risk:

*Do the opt out voting where default is yes. Justification for this is not wanting to inconvenience the miners and the strong community support for fork. 

*If don‚Äôt want to do that then please make the voting as easy as possible AND in the next post and instructions regarding the soft fork, I recommend including the ENTIRE process. That way when we go back to the pools and ask them to vote one more time, we can at least tell them with confidence this is the last time and show them the entire process step-by-step to activation. You might consider posting it here for our review before posting to public.

Probably the risk of the pools not taking these extra steps to complete EIP 27 vote is not too high but even say 3-5% chance is pretty high in my opinion given its importance so we should do our best to mitigate this risk.

Thanks!

I just got out of the meeting, we got an offer from Huobi.

Putin invades... very bad timing

They want 500K usdt deposit and 300K in ERG for marketing etc.

500K usdt is beyond our budget.

I can offer an OTC to cover at least a chunk of the usdt to the EF maybe, need to check my siutation. 

Also Dan will see if he can negotiate that fee lower.

[02/24/2022 7:23 AM] Justin1000#9555
Got to make it happen. Will be huge. Although agree our luck on timing couldn't be worse. Alternatives I can think of:

-pay full price and scrape by - we got some btc and ERG price will almost certainly be higher soon

-negotiate them lower and/or pay in installments like 1/2 now and 1/2 in 6 months. We got good excuse for this given market afterall

-do otc sale to raise some USDT. I would also gladly do like USDT 100k if desired. However I have to say selling any ergs here ahead of tier 1 listing isn't attractive. But its an option for consideration if necessary.

We can get by with some combination of above. This will be huge step in legitimatizing ergo. I also read recently Huobi is expanding back to US.

Several years of tighter crypto regulation in China has given Huobi further impetus to expand into other parts of Asia with Europe and the U.S. next.

Just says are expanding in US. Not sure will actually be exchange or not.

Have to admit listing there isn't as attractive as it looked mid last year but still a great exchange.


[02/24/2022 8:32 AM] glasgowm#9381
I would put huboi in the same tier as kucoin. But has less volume/users and a dwindling share with having banned their main customers. 

So think the price is a bit mental unless it was binance/kraken/coinbase. Especially as it'd wipe us out of fiat with no clear plan for continued operation.

[02/24/2022 10:47 AM] Justin1000#9555
You might be right sadly. Since I was so excited about possibility on listing on Huobi last year, a lot has changed and Huobi has lost market share and Kucoin has gained it. Seems reasonable they are similar user base too. I still think Huobi is better but the difference has certainly narrowed.

And while the cost is not unreasonable for a top-tier exchange in my view, it is very expensive for our current resources.

Binance and Kraken would be better for us probably. I am not sure we have enough money to do Huobi right now
üôÅ


[02/24/2022 12:54 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah maybe better holding out to see if Kraken give us an in. Huobi might be our best option as a stepping-stone to get some volume if we don't meet their requirements but don't see how it could be feasible without a big reduction in the ask (or a big pump in price). Maybe they're coming to us now because nobody else will pay them though. 

Coinbase is the only one I dont have anything for. I know they're traditionally exclusive but they are opening the floodgates for new coins.


[02/24/2022 12:55 PM] glasgowm#9381
Done a quick poll in the community - but maybe just spending 100k on kucoin marketing would be better spent than going after anyone outside binance/coinbase/kraken

Dan Friedman:

The thing is Kukoin is nowhere near Huobi in terms of how people view markets in Asia. 

 Huobi, at least on this side of the world, is a tier 1 exchange. 

Binance will cost a lot more. Something line 1mil plus, unless you have a serious in or a huge amount of volume.


[02/25/2022 1:57 AM] Armeanio#0321
Dan  Friedman:

But like I said, a Huobi listing will open up a huge part of the Asian market for us. 

Plus, all those guys are connected. Kraken, Binance etc talk to each other. If we pass on this simply because it's too much money, other exchanges will not want to waste their time

Tier 1 listings are usually 1mil plus and usually in a stable


[02/25/2022 3:56 AM] Armeanio#0321
Please remember the deposit 500K is refundable after a period of 6 months. 

We will be rolling over the Kucoin deposit period soon.


[02/25/2022 3:57 AM] Armeanio#0321
So we should be recieving 200K usdt back soon from that initial listing deposit.


[02/25/2022 3:58 AM] Armeanio#0321
The 500K is basically a rug listing fee security deposit mechanism by Huobi. So this is a lockup period not money burnt from the treasury.


[02/25/2022 3:58 AM] Armeanio#0321
The actual cost/loss is the 300K $usd  in ERG.


[02/25/2022 4:10 AM] Armeanio#0321
Sorry for the lack of clarity it was late here.


[02/25/2022 4:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
Oh! I was just writing a long message saying how I actually agreed with Dan and we should do it and I was still assuming the $500k was a listing fee and not refundable. If it is refundable, we should DEFINITELY do it! We can scrape by one way or another before get the deposit back. Maybe do small OTC sale or sell some BTC to cover expenses in meantime. Also, I think @Armeanio is saying can get some MM funds back probably to help cover it.

I think we should try to reduce the $300k in ERGs given we are tight on funds now and not sure we will get much value back for that ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù. But if they insist on $300k, I think definitely should still proceed.

I do believe Huobi is better regarded than Kucoin and feel is better whatever volume may be now. Huobi is listed on HK stock exchange by the way‚Ä¶good sign for long-term.

As Dan is saying, we can‚Äôt turn down such tier 1 exchanges when finally get an offer to list unless their pricing is totally unreasonable which this certainly is not.

Yes 300k in erg potentially might be better so they have skin in the game. 

We could use the 200k from kucoin to fund the banking balance.


[02/25/2022 2:37 PM] Armeanio#0321
This would be the conservative approach here anyway.

I just want to remind everyone that despite the regulations, China is still hugely important ‚Äì recently I saw article it was the richest country in the world now in terms of accumulated wealth and savings. Also, Eva is doing a great job and has been getting Ergopad info translated and disseminated to the Chinese community as well as helping them with problems. I am optimistic Chinese interest will grow as the ecosystem builds out and there are more projects and tokens to speculate on. 

Very important to keep info flow going to China about Ergo. @kushti, no huge rush but please do sign the Jinse contract when you have time (and you need to change dates in contract too please).

[03/18/2022 6:58 AM] Justin1000#9555
I am not overly concerned about USDT or its reserves myself. But I think all the centralized stable coins have some regulatory and fraud risk even if minimal at this point. So it might make sense to diversify stable coin holdings into 2 or 3 (maybe USDC and BUSD?). But if its only a small amount or few % points of Foundation assets, doubtful that is worthwhile and can probably just keep in USDT and Fiat USD.

But after transferring the USDT to Liongate and accumulating more in the future, its something we should consider.


[03/23/2022 4:23 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti Jinse agreement is above this message I sent in early March. Please sign when possible. Eva is keen to get articles going again and Jinse keeps pushing us. Please just quickly change the dates to reflect 1 year period starting the day you sign. Thanks!

Yeah I was thinking of the two if there was no difference - USDC is at least backed? But I guess in a bank account it's insured anyway.


[03/29/2022 1:42 PM] glasgowm#9381
Are we going to be shooting ourselves in the foot a little reducing emissions so drastically just before the 'merge' (assuming it goes ahead - which it seems like from their last meeting it's good to go / live on testnet).

The two things that I want to bring up for the weekly meeting.

1. I am still unclear on the Huobi funding vote. please vote. 

2. We need to get some records from gate that shows the origins of our USDT for the Bank in the Bahamas.


[03/29/2022 3:09 PM] glasgowm#9381
1. Seems even at +150k it's still a decent deal. Bit of a dick move but I'd say still worthwhile to proceed with?

[03/29/2022 3:48 PM] Justin1000#9555
I don‚Äôt think so myself for the following reasons:
**1 Network Security and Risk Premium**: If the network is not as close to guaranteed secure as possible for long-term, it deters investors and developers from spending money/time on Ergo as they will need to demand a higher risk premium. I think this supersedes any issues in the short-term about reducing mining rewards.

**2 Inflation Rate Still High Post-fork**: Even after fork, Ergo inflation will be roughly 30% (if just use 50mm existing coins and assume 50 ERG / block). Ravencoin appears to be only 15% inflation. So in the short-term at least, the rewards as % of network to miners should remain competitive. 

**3 Already Decided**: I think for all intents and purposes the soft-fork has already been decided on by the community. Just implementation remains and has been delayed a bit due to testing etc. I think we would have to have a big reason to change now. Also I don‚Äôt feel we should let what ETH might or might not do effect our decision making on this. 

**4 Different Emission # Not Practical**: Could argue 12 is not the right reduction and should be 8, 9, 15 or something. But this is not exact science and we have already agreed 12 and not practical to reach a community consensus on something different I think.

**5 Price Remains Biggest Factor**: A ~20% reduction in rewards is nothing compared to the short-term price fluctuations. If the soft fork boosts price due to building confidence in the network and by creating a virtuous feedback loop driven by more limited supply, that way more than compensates for the reduction.


[03/29/2022 3:49 PM] Justin1000#9555
The only issue I see is the more longer-term one as we hit the really low emission rate sooner with the soft-fork. But based on quick calculations, looks like Ergo inflation rate post soft-fork won‚Äôt drop much below Ravencoin until 2026 when it hits 3 ERG /block. But we got this problem anyway, just one year later if we don‚Äôt do a soft-fork and then we also got the much bigger problem of no block reward subsidy at all post year 8. Just need to get the network really active by 2026 so the fees kick in. I think this is doable - more doable then building network usage without confidence inspired by soft-fork.

Could consider doing something where you keep rewards at say 6 / block for years 7-10 or something and then go to 3 for x years and then 2 for y years. But I am doubtful this is practical given we have already reached community consensus on the fork and its all quite arbitrary and predicting future network usage is impossible.


[03/29/2022 3:49 PM] Justin1000#9555
I hope we can activate the soft-fork ASAP. It has already been a while since we reached community consensus and small risk the longer things go on activation could become harder (for example if new mining pools start mining on the network!)

I agree with these but I was meaning more directly in the next few months as tons of hash will start looking for a new home and eip27 could drop us in the rankings for a bit (Based on the assumption that it usually takes a while to feel the impact with halvings on other chains)

But yeh we need a clear date/block/path forward as community is getting frustrated.

[04/03/2022 4:29 AM] Justin1000#9555
Can't say for sure. But I think that most likely when EIP27 is locked in, it will help the price and more than 20% so $ amt to miners will probably go up. It certainly SHOULD do that because of the lower risk premium that should get reflected in the ERG price. Different than a normal halving because in those you aren't resolving a fundamental security concern but just decreasing supply which I agree takes time to reflect in price.

That being said crypto markets are not known for being efficient so its possible the activation doesn't get reflected in price much at all. In any case I don't think it changes calculus at all for me in relation EIP27...just need to do what is needed for good of network as soon as possible. Also good for miner minds share will be more exchanges and market access.

I don't think there is any issue myself with ErgoDEX telling potential investors and partners the EF gave a grant to them. But let me know if any objections. I am working with them a little on their fund raising and they want to share info on Funding to date and what investors they have talked to so far.

I can also tell them though that they should not make any public announcement to this effect. Before a public announcement is made, the messaging needs to be agreed with EF.

[04/26/2022 4:15 PM] Justin1000#9555
Some things:
***Ergodex**: Closing seed this week. $517k of the $600k done at a $30mm valuation. The remaining $83k they will roll over to the next round if no one asks for it. Not sure on final investor list but from what I saw before it looked like a few funds such as Danxia Capital, Big Brain Holdings, Riviera Capital did come in. The big majority of Funds they met were not interested as size was too small and many don't know much about Ergo and their presentation skills still need work. But they are probably in a good position to get some more investors in during the next round if they keep making progress on the DEX and are flexible on terms and things go well for Ergo as a whole. 

***Exchanges for Ecosystem Projects:** I messaged Marty today about us helping him with exchanges for Ergopad. Maybe need to put more thought into this though. Maybe Ergopad should try to form a partnership with a really solid exchange like Huobi, Okex, Binance that does good marketing. Then Ergopad can funnel quality ecosystem projects onto this exchange. Epad is still small market cap and liquidity but I think they got a lot to offer an exchange as they will be the go-to launch platform for promising projects launching on Ergo so they can use that as leverage possibly to get a good partnership with an exchange. Gate.io was mentioned as one candidate by Eva but maybe Okex, Huobi or some other top exchange better. Anyway I think Epad team should take CEXs seriously given their role in the ecosystem and maybe we can help them out initially.


[04/26/2022 4:15 PM] Justin1000#9555
***Pace of Developments:** Although things are going great, I think the slow pace of exchange listings, EIP 27, cross chain etc is weighing on sentiment in the ecosystem. This slows the pace of attracting more developers and ecosystem build out. Probably not much we can do about it but be aware and if there are any exchanges we can start process with now then should probably not wait as it always seems to take longer than expected.


[04/26/2022 5:09 PM] glasgowm#9381
In a bit of good news we should have private ledger beta and website relaunch in next few days. Huobi integration seems to be going pretty quick too so hopefully not much longer. (They're up and running already, and now booting their own explorer instance).

My preference would be to just ask the pools vote in favor and us announce when they have all told us they will vote yes and announce when the vote is completed on-chain in favor so the community knows the activation is happening on June ~21. Sooner the better too. Thanks to your, Glasgow‚Äôs and Kushti‚Äôs efforts we already had a very public transparent process with public discussion across virtually all platforms. And even a onchain vote already. Called ‚Äúindicative‚Äù but that vote makes this vote basically a foregone conclusion meaning shouldn‚Äôt be a need for a public pressure campaign. I think for all practical purposes we are in the activation stage at this point and this last vote should just be a formality.

So yeah I am in favor of us just doing what we can to get it done and move on. If the pools don‚Äôt vote yes soon for some reason, then a twitter campaign to pressure them makes sense to me. I would just be worried doing another public campaign now could cause ppl to have fatigue over this whole issue, get distracted from other exciting things happening and increase uncertainty and its been so long already since we had all these public debates. Good to just get it locked and us all move on I think. Just my opinion anyway‚Ä¶

Great! I would guess Huobi will be good but not a game changer. Need other exchanges and cross chain. 

Given how long it takes for exchanges, it would be good to push forward with any other top exchanges we can now and not wait if we have any ins with any. I guess after Huobi is done can share the announcement with exchanges we had stalled discussions with like Bitfinex.

Great outcome for this year would be to get on OKEX, Kraken and Binance after Huobi!


[05/05/2022 7:22 AM] Justin1000#9555
Wish could happen quicker. I think Ergo will be successful even if it takes a lot of time but I feel Ergo is handicapped versus other chains in attracting dev mindshare and apps to the platform as long as its not on these big exchanges and doesn‚Äôt have cross chain. But things going great anyway...


[05/05/2022 8:01 AM] glasgowm#9381
Think the only in we have (Kraken) is conditional on additional volume that Huobi will bring. OKX need 5m vol too


[05/05/2022 8:04 AM] glasgowm#9381
Would be good to get any more regional exchanges under our belt (Coinspot, Swyftx, WarizX). CRO have also created a new listing page. Not sure if we've tried them

https://crypto.com/eea/listing (edit: looks like this url is fundraising/IDO specific actually)


[05/05/2022 8:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think liquidity will continue to increase organically as 1) ERG price rises; 2) ERG supply rises; 3) more DAPPs and ecosystem excitement. Think this will all happen and will get above $5mm/day but who knows when. Maybe we can do other things to get the volume up quicker.


[05/05/2022 8:32 AM] Justin1000#9555
Things off the top of my head MIGHT get more volume from:
*Add ADA:ERG pair onto Kucoin ‚Äì I think we should do this. Probably could be good arb pair to have too with the ADA:ERG pair on ErgoDEX to come. Can someone contact Kucoin and get it added ASAP? Think cost was $30k.

*Add Gate.io BTC:ERG Pair ‚Äì This would generate some extra volume. I guess I can also ask Gate.io if any other ideas to boost volume.

*Hotbit: I still get the daily market making reports from them. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt recall now for sure how the MM is done there but I think Hotbit does it for us. Maybe can ask them to boost volume by $100k per pair for another $300k a day. I think it is free. I can check if sounds okay?

*HitBTC: Not a fan of this exchange but they have a lot of volume and only $22k ERG:BTC volume. Maybe this can be boosted? Maye Kairon knows them and can handle this for us? Seems like long shot though as we didn‚Äôt even go through formal listing process there.
    
*Coinex: Volume really low despite being historically big exchange for Erg. Maybe some MM can be done there to get it closer to Hotbit numbers?


[05/05/2022 8:33 AM] Justin1000#9555
*MM activities: Can ask Kairon again. I think getting more reported volume would have to be done with zero fee MM accounts like those on Hotbit (I think) and maybe Coinex or some other smaller exchanges.

*List Binance first: Think will get us to >$5mm volume if they are willing to list and then can get straight on Kraken and OKex. IF Binance willing‚Ä¶

*Regional Exchanges: Can probably pick up some limited volume here but not sure how much.

*Crypto.com: I don‚Äôt know much about them but mentioned like a year ago they were big and we should apply so definitely support giving it a try.

*Bitfinex: Push them again after Huobi listing. I guess we would pick up some volume listing there.


[05/05/2022 8:33 AM] Justin1000#9555
Maybe we can just do some of the above in combination with Huobi listing to get enough volume to get on Kraken then we go to Okex and then to Binance.


[05/05/2022 11:14 AM] Justin1000#9555
But if Kraken lists after Huobi could already see $5mm a day soon, enough for OKX. I guess Kraken will bring a lot as must be a lot of potential US buyers who haven't gotten into Ergo yet due to lack of US exchange. Still think should consider some of the above steps to boost volume though.

Update on miner feedback on EIP-27 above. Nothing alarming, however, I was originally hoping we could announce ‚Äúall the pools supported it‚Äù or ‚Äúall the pools but x supported it‚Äù but some of the responses although implying strongly will vote yes are not conclusive so don‚Äôt think can make any such announcement right now.

Don‚Äôt feel I should trouble them more at the moment. Can we monitor closely onchain to see how the vote is going and reassess sometime next week to see if any pools not yet voting to follow up with?

Only one said didn‚Äôt want to vote Yes was F2pool but I suspect they didn‚Äôt spend anytime researching it or considering because Ergo is such a tiny amount of their business and they are only ~1% of network. 

Anyway should all be good but can‚Äôt tell for 100% sure at moment.

Sorry for delay but was May 1 holiday and stuff. Attached above is Jinse agreement. Eva confirmed address with them as well so think you can just send the $40k worth of Erg based on the Gate.io price whenever you send it to 9f561hnH4rgxcBCNFEuvxjn2bohjStLwbj9v2dzMD5masyy59nL


[05/08/2022 12:16 PM] Justin1000#9555
after pay let us know transaction confirmation and Eva can start pushing content again. Sadly going to be a lot of ERGs given low ERG price but have a lot of material to push through given all that is going on in the ecosystem.


[05/08/2022 12:22 PM] glasgowm#9381
2miners are the only ones voting so far. Mined 19 of the last 100 blocks


[05/08/2022 12:22 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah. I saw was only about 2-3 blocks in every 10 in support so far...


[05/08/2022 12:24 PM] Justin1000#9555
I hope we can push them to approve it ASAP somehow. Need good news in this bad market. And EIP-27 is biggest outstanding issue for Ergo in my opinion. Don't have much doubt they will approve it but good to get it approved asap so we can announce.

Maybe we can appeal to the miners self interest next week and ask them if they are going to vote yes anyway to please do so soon. That way we have positive news in the current bad market environment that MIGHT help the price a little and thus miner profits...


[05/09/2022 10:19 AM] Justin1000#9555
2miners take out the vote? Maybe I don't know how to read it but when I look in the explorer there is not "8" in votes anymore for any blocks.


[05/09/2022 10:34 AM] glasgowm#9381
I've just got a wee script that checks. Yep looks like they don't have it set up anymore. Or maybe they have multiple nodes and it's reverted to one where it's not set.

@kushti can you check with 2miners? Probably something just got messed up on their end. Need their vote back to yes soon as good chance the others are going to start voting now.

Oops, thought no meeting today, then missed the notification, sorry.


[05/10/2022 4:56 PM] Justin1000#9555
20 "8" votes in a row since block 746496 :). @kushti maybe just have a quick look to make sure everything in order. if any issues we should let the miner pools know ASAP so they can fix before next epoch. But looks to me EIP-27 will be approved this epoch!


[05/10/2022 4:59 PM] morphic#4133
so the pools are not using public release, right? 
I see EIP-27 PR is not merged yet and so not released


[05/10/2022 5:03 PM] Justin1000#9555
This is just voting to signal support and lock it in. I think they can do that with any node version. But with miner full approval and it locked-in, we can at least remove any remaining uncertainty around EIP-27.


[05/10/2022 5:08 PM] morphic#4133
yes, I understand the "signal support" part, but how it enables "lock in"? 
In order for the first reemission box to be created (or injected as in EIP27) the pool should use a version that support EIP27. 
So what if they vote now, and not update the version later?


[05/10/2022 5:19 PM] Justin1000#9555
Well then you would be talking about a real split. Shouldn't be much chance of that given the high threshold and public nature of the signalling. Can just announce EIP-27 is approved if meets the 888 yes votes required in this epoch then focus the pools on the update process before block 777,217.

After network problem last night, Herominers signalling for EIP-27 switched off. Unlikely to reach threshold until they turn it back on. I mentioned it to them but no response. Very good to get the onchain vote out of the way ASAP....so I hope they start signalling again.

[05/11/2022 5:20 PM] kushti#0978

[05/12/2022 7:48 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti Signaling was at ~97% support and it was set to go through last epoch before the network issue. If you want to register the onchain vote, I suggest you asking herominers again to signal and just get it out of the way. If they turn it on today, good chance can still get it done this epoch. Would also allow us to announce the successful passage of EIP-27. Not sure will make much difference with the overwhelming negative sentiment right now but would certaintly be a piece of good news...


[05/15/2022 3:52 PM] kushti#0978
Testing new version now which hopefully will fix that split issue finally. So will ping HM and others on release, tomorrow hopefully

FYI on signalling. Given changes in hash rate distribution, looks like could reach the threshold even if Herominers doesn't vote. Might keep an eye on it. Ideally though...Herominers will start signalling again.


[05/23/2022 1:55 PM] Justin1000#9555
FYI: All major pools signalling now except Woolypooly so threshold should be comfortably reached soon. Woolypooly was signalling before so I don't think they mean anything by not singalling now. Just stopped when network problem hit a week or so ago.

Woolypooly supports it...just stopped signalling after the May 11 network problem. Else would be over 90%. Think can just use the 888 blocks Kushti specified in the final post. More practical number for future forks too I think. And 888 is good number in China.

Guess vote went through. After confirmed, probably a good idea to announce. Not sure will make much difference but any good news is good to get out there in current bad market. Concerned about low price. Projects will have very hard time raising money for development/marketing in current environment and with the low ERG price/liquidity.

I am not sure it is worth it anymore given the terrible market and low ERG price but I think better pay Jinse ASAP since we already signed the contract and made agreement. They have been asking Eva when payment is going to be made. At least we are getting a really good deal from them and can push basically unlimited content. @kushti @Stacie

Ex-CEO of Jinse also just messaged me asking if we wanted intro to Huobi. I told him we already had contact but thanked him anyway. He said he still owned a lot of ERG and was wondering how things were going. I guess if you meet any more problems @Armeanio we can try and get him involved to help. Hope can list on Huobi ASAP.

[05/27/2022 6:46 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yes impossible to predict but I think we should start assuming will be a crypto winter like past ones and adjust spending and strategy to suit that. Maybe discuss on the next call. I think priority of spending should be on:
-Exchange listings
-Encouraging developers and projects building on Ergo ecosystem ‚Äì this is my biggest concern in bear market is that sources of funding like through Ergopad will dry up so maintaining the forward momentum is important
-Maintaining steady stream of content like the new youtube videos, Proof of Ergo, Ergo Prism, AMAs, Development etc


[05/27/2022 6:46 AM] Justin1000#9555
Less important I think is things like general press releases or expensive marketing activities geared toward more general audience. We don‚Äôt have the money and I think will mostly fall on deaf ears in current market.


[05/27/2022 6:47 AM] Justin1000#9555
Personally, I think the Fed is going to back off fairly soon and turn the money printer on like never before. Should lead in a boost to bitcoin/crypto but not sure the full-on Bull market will resume after all the scams and garbage in this industry. I think in the next upturn it won‚Äôt be just about making money anymore but people in many countries will be struggling for survival as their economies are in terrible shape. So hopefully this will lead to a focus more back on fundamental principals instead of ponzis/scams. If so, Ergo will be in an extremely good position especially with 60% of the supply issued, much lower inflation and developer tools and materials built out. Maybe FOMO can really take hold next time. Or maybe everyone will just go after scams and ponzis again‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know.

[06/10/2022 9:05 AM] Justin1000#9555
Eva sent me a bunch of messages. Brief summary:
-Lots of old miners in our groups. Focusing on getting some of them to move their ETH hash to Ergo.
-Many big holders >10k ERG.
-One guy acquired >500k Ergopad and is investing in new projects. But this guy only moved 10% of his holdings to ERG. The other 90% is still in ETH.
-She says lots of complaints in community that there hasn‚Äôt been any Jinse articles recently
-Also Tongtong at Jinse is still pushing for the payment
-Indicates that Chinese don‚Äôt like to read and watch stuff by other Chinese for crypto. So reading the blog posts and articles on Jinse of the original English materials written by foreigners is impactful.
-Eva is really big on Jinse. Says is biggest way to attract people to the community. I think it is useful too but not sure how much so. Anyway she should know best‚Ä¶I have noticed Jinse has been active‚Ä¶done twitter spaces, have active telegram etc.

Just thought I would share the above since I don‚Äôt think you have much insight into the Chinese community. 

I told her to consider doing monthly updates.

I do think China remains a very important market despite the regulations/lockdowns and all.

Just watched this. Think he makes some good points and glad he will be taking initiative on that. Guess we should help him where possible.

I am optimistic ERG price will start to outperform soon and hopefully we won‚Äôt have to spend too many ERGs at this low price and will have plentiful funds when the price is high. 

However, it isn‚Äôt certain so good to encourage more active community funding via raffles, community DAO, whale funds etc.


[06/10/2022 10:12 AM] Justin1000#9555
Eva thinks lots of Chinese in ergopad and will be big into funding new projects. She should know because been working directly with Marty and helping them promote and stuff (I originally suggested she do this a few months ago).

Any chance changing the epoch length is interesting? 

The difficulty retargeting could be sped up. 

I think shortening it 4 or 8 times would be good. 

The governance aspect is a lot different with pools vs autlykos1 so I don't think it would change much.


[06/23/2022 3:31 PM] Armeanio#0321
Miners would 100% support that.


[06/23/2022 3:48 PM] Armeanio#0321
128 or 256 blocks vs 1024 makes sense to me.


[06/23/2022 4:18 PM] Armeanio#0321
The question i have is what other potential dependencies that would be impacted in changing the epoch length. 

I don't think it's worth changing the retargeting mechanism just shortening the epoch length so difficulty targeting is more performant.


[06/23/2022 4:20 PM] Armeanio#0321
Not necessarily the highest priority atm but something we should start to consider/investigate.


[06/27/2022 4:05 PM] Justin1000#9555
FYI: Tongtong, the main working level contact at Jinse told Eva today we should pay before month end because she understands the cost of cooperation is going to go up 8-10x soon. Guess something the new CEO is doing.


[06/28/2022 12:03 PM] Justin1000#9555
Eva suggests we can offer Jinse to pay monthly or quarterly instead of the full amount in a lump sum. she can ask them if we are willing.


[06/29/2022 8:27 AM] Justin1000#9555
Eva spoke to Marty about ergopad paying part of jinse and them also being able to use it too. He seems willing to consider paying $12k worth but wanted to know if we would consider paying the other $28k before makes decision


[06/29/2022 2:56 PM] kushti#0978
We have abt $120K and 150K to pay Huobi

@Stacie Hi Stacie,

please send monthly salary to Eva:
USD1,800 / 1.9345 = 930 Ergs + 55 Ergs bonus = total 985 Ergs

Please send to Eva's same address, thanks:

[07/01/2022 8:21 AM] Justin1000#9555
I doubt any need for bonus anymore. The bonus was to retain her when market was really good. Now market is terrible. And she has probably accumulated enough ERGs by now to stay motivated without that small additional bonus.


[07/01/2022 10:41 AM] Stacie#8189
Please, let me know how much shall I send


[07/01/2022 10:55 AM] Justin1000#9555
Actually I suggest leaving the bonus for now. So 985 as Noah originally suggested. But we can consider removing it once the price goes back up a fair bit. Not the ideal time to cut it given has probably lost a lot on holding ERG and sends the wrong message. But she won't need it anymore once price rebounds I think.


[07/01/2022 8:51 PM] glasgowm#9381

Happy Ergoversary everyone! All the content was great and really seemed to have an impact.


[07/02/2022 7:22 AM] Justin1000#9555
But on the financial front we seem to have some issues! Not paying or not paying for months after contracts are signed is not acceptable ‚Äì Jinse for example was a great relationship made through face-to-face meetings in China (a country most people can‚Äôt even get into right now) that may go up in smoke and we could have used the visibility we got through pushing content there the past months since the contract was signed! Was a great deal too.


[07/02/2022 7:25 AM] Justin1000#9555
But I am more worried about Huobi. The above doesn‚Äôt seem very substantiated to me. We can‚Äôt eliminate all counterparty risk and what if it is Kucoin that goes down instead and we are still messing around with Huobi? We will be out our best exchange without even a replacement. Has the $300k in ERG for marketing been paid and we still owe the $150k listing fee and are short $30k? Well if so we just need to solve the problem, get the $30k and pay them and insure we have the necessary $USDT per month to cover the USDT ongoing outgoings.

I think we need more active financial management/strategy and to try and solve some of the operational bottleknecks in getting payments done. I suggest from now on the Foundation has a quarterly call on budgeting and financial strategy. We just need to have some detailed talks on this so everyone is on same page. We need both a short-term and a long-term strategy and attempt to solve any operational issues. We should be able to sort all this out now we have @Stacie to help. The first such call can be our bi-weekly foundation call next Tuesday and after that @Stacie  can make a calendar entry quarterly and remind us in advance.


[07/02/2022 7:28 AM] Justin1000#9555
If this is okay, I am going to make a one pager up of the potential issues and suggestions and some thoughts on what our strategy might be for everyone‚Äôs consideration and discussion. With 1.2mm ERGs left in the treasury and in the middle of a bad market, this is becoming very important.

[07/02/2022 10:20 AM] mhs_sam#1471
I agree with Justin. 
- I still did not get why we had not paid Jinse yet.
- Are we short $30k for paying Houbi? We should pay it soon since the community is waiting for it for a long time. I can lend $30k in USDT to EF (out of books) for 3-6 months or buy ERG from EF, if EF does not want sell in the market.


[07/02/2022 10:40 AM] mhs_sam#1471
Also, there are some rumors about kucoin insolvency.


[07/02/2022 10:57 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah I was also going to propose I could lend if needed. I am not entirely sure whether @kushti means we have $120k in and still need to pay $150 or we have $120k AFTER the $150 payment to Huobi. But anyway, yes we need to pay ASAP and get the listing done.

I will make up a few pages so we can have a productive discussion about budgeting and financial strategy going forward.

[07/02/2022 2:25 PM] Justin1000#9555
Above is rudimentary but probably good starting point can use to guide our discussion/thinking on this. Think we should discuss Tuesday. Hope you can read it ahead of time and have some ideas. I think my main takeaways from this exercise are:
-Should avoid deep immediate cuts for next 3 months as things could turn around soon. But should still have a look at where can cut back as probably doesn‚Äôt make sense for us to be spending as much in $ now as we were 6 months ago when market much better. I don‚Äôt really know where might be able to cut but you guys probably much better informed. Also, Angie should have a think as well.

-We all need to aim to get the 40-50k ERG/month fixed costs number down in the longer-term. Its just too high unless very strong revenue sources are identified. 20k is in this doc as a target but that is extremely rudimentary and will change. But on the other hand, the problem will completely solve itself if the ERG price goes up enough. But should probably plan for a more subdued scenario for next 2-3 years or so.

-Got some time‚Ä¶maybe 2+ years but may need community DAO going as a supplement or replacement to Foundation.


[07/02/2022 4:41 PM] glasgowm#9381
What's the hold up for Jinse? Seems to have been requested/confirmed a couple times in the chat. Some bottleneck/roadblock?

On spending, seems to be mostly wages; 

- Ilya (2-3k ERG?); very high wage considering he's part time (and the explorer has been struggling); know he's also training people up so unsure how many hours he's spending on ergo vs ergodex
- Carlos (1k ERG) - Parada? what are we paying him for? 
- anon_real (1k ERG); is running successful dApps so should be doing okay off fees? Also been waiting since Ergohack I for this DAO solution üò≠ 
- Rust (2-5k ERG) is mostly bounties so maybe that could be scaled back painlessly
- Agree we can cut most of marketing expenses as we're pissing against the wind until retail/sentiment returns
- Think Sean (Editor) and Andy (Youtube) are both on hourly rates
- I have a couple premium subscriptions I could scale down but I don't think we have much spending here

It would be good if we could get people to fill in time-sheets or something too, for clarities sake if anything as it's difficult to tell what's going on day-to-day.

Main concern is depleting all our reserves when the market could crash us to 20c and we start burning through the treasury at 10x the rate. Even cashing out a couple of grand each time the RR is above 400% on sigusd and putting that in a SigUSD/ERG pair would allow us to build up an emergency fund while earning a little.

I didn't cash out enough at the top - but am being taxed like I did, and currently earning less than the entry role I turned down so not really in a position to reduce in my rewards. As a brucey bonus found out I'm going to be a dad (on the day BTC lost structure no less). Wedding is next week, then I'll be off for the second half of July for the honeymoon - sorry for the late notice but weren't sure if we were going to go (and still not sure what we're going to do, but flights are non-refundable).

Alternatively if we get a bit of relief like Kairon suspects or get a handle on our planning I'd opt for giving people a raise to match inflation as you'd make it back in work ethic / price-appreciation.


[07/03/2022 6:28 AM] Justin1000#9555
Congrats on everything! I think July in a bad market should be perfect time to take some time off.

{Reactions}

[07/03/2022 6:32 AM] Justin1000#9555
In my idea of short-term plan the idea is not deep cuts but to:
*Cut waste and near-useless spending which some has probably accumulated
*Start thinking about the problem so we are not flying blind anymore
*NOT cut out any capabilities or do any permanent damage to what we have built for now

Need to keep in mind price is down so a lot of ERG people working on Ergo just lost a lot of $. To then also cut their rewards drastically isn‚Äôt a good strategy‚Ä¶especially when ERG may rebound very soon and we need them all. But we should remove waste or stuff inappropriate for current market.


I think everything is going to be fine. Just need to prepare to cut back so can survive for a while if market stays bad is all. Even sub $1 ERG shouldn‚Äôt be end of world although would need to make serious short-term cuts.


[07/03/2022 6:41 AM] Justin1000#9555
**Jinse**: I think at this point we should just hold off. The damage has been done already. My idea is to wait till the price improves then go beg for them to take us back. Maybe we offer them a little sweetener like $50k in ERGs or something if they will give us the same deal as before. Payment should have been made right away after contract signed but now damage is done and price is low and would be 20k ERGs even if could convince them to keep the old agreement we breached.
**Development Bounties**: Defer to @kushti . I think should cut all these out while price is low and reinstate them when price goes back up to save ERGs. But I dunno how essential they are in the short-term.
**Documentation/Education Bounties**: Same as above if any still around. Doubt should do it when price so low.
**Blog/Article Bounties**: If any, I think these can continue as regular content is essential.
**Marketing Bounties**: Should probably keep but please watch costs.


[07/03/2022 6:42 AM] Justin1000#9555
**Glasgow/Armeanio**: Both should be 1,500 I think (so Armeanio higher). Actually, both should be higher than this but I don‚Äôt know if practical when we are trying to manage costs.
**Anastasia**: I think should go up to 1,000 given lower ERG price. Again, maybe should be higher but I dunno how to do it right now. Hopefully ERG price rebounds soon and everyone is doing good.
**Oskin**: Sheet says 2,000. If 2,000, I don‚Äôt think should reduce right away since he has been doing such valuable work for Ergo since very beginning and while Ergodex raised some funds, its not that much and still very much in start-up mode. But @kushti may want to talk to him and warn him that reduction may come in 3 months and possibly another one in 6 months. If more than 2,000 should probably cut down to 2,000 now as long as he is okay with it.
**Carlos**: Should go to zero if not doing any defined work with deliverables. I think he is active member of community and saw he was working on some stuff with waves but at this point he should be happy to do that stuff for free just as a member of the community.


[07/03/2022 6:43 AM] Justin1000#9555
**Me**: I should be zero now. 
**Raffles**: I think this is @mhs_sam  team? I think we not long ago voted to support it with more ERGs. Again, I don‚Äôt think any need for immediate cuts but things do change fast in volatile crypto industry so maybe @mhs_sam  can try control costs and it may indeed be necessary to cut back next quarter if things don‚Äôt improve with ERG price.
**Amitabh**: Does super valuable work so don‚Äôt suggest any change. If I understand though, he is hourly and USD. @kushti, if there is anything he is doing that is not really high priority, you might consider asking him to slow down a little in this time while ERG price so low. NOT STOP ANYTHING IMPORTANT ‚Äì just no need to be working tons of hours on less priority stuff when ERG = $2 is all.
**Anon-real**: Defer to @kushti . If he is really making good money on DAPPs, maybe take him down to 500 or something‚Ä¶else just leave it at 1,000 for now.


[07/03/2022 6:47 AM] Justin1000#9555
**Benjamin**: Really important and good work. @morphic , guess no change here needed but if you think his hours can be moderated slightly while ERG price is low and market bad, then you can speak to him. Else just leave it alone is fine.
**CW**: Good to leave as is. Think the video content he is doing is really valuable even in bad market. Other regular video content that has been produced lately is also really good and should be kept.
**Dan**: Good to leave as is. Hope he stays as Advisor and continues doing what he is doing.
**Eva**: I might talk to her about bonus. But otherwise she is very important as our main China person. She also has a small budget for community management which should retain but keep costs low.
**Omer**: I think he does blog posts? Can‚Äôt remember. If he is the main blog producer, then I think important to leave as is. This regular content is very important.


[07/03/2022 6:48 AM] Justin1000#9555
**Irregular Marketing**: Seems ok to me. Even in bad market, we still got to do basic marketing of events like Ergohack. But if there is any high paid mass marketing professionals or other expenses like press releases I don‚Äôt know about, I think they should all be cut out. Very expensive and its not going to produce any results when the mainstream is not interested in crypto like now.
**Timesheets**: Maybe someday but I am doubtful we will even have time to review them if we ask people to put them together so not too keen to push it myself. 
**Raises**: Yeah, I wish we could. I think we just keep things humming while market bad and hopefully price recovers soon enough and everyone is good. Even if we concluded that ~20k/month ERGs is really the right medium/long-term budget goal, we don‚Äôt have to cut everyone immediately to get there if price rises so that can act as a sort of bonus. Just depends on market I guess.


[07/03/2022 6:49 AM] Justin1000#9555
Everything else looks okay to me‚Ä¶

**IMPORTANT POINT ON MESSAGING**: If anyone talks to people or anything about changes‚Ä¶make sure not to indicate anything is wrong and Foundation doesn‚Äôt have money or whatever. This is just normal financial planning we should have done already. We don‚Äôt want to alarm anyone. This is especially important for @kushti to remember as is always so modest.

I dunno if @Armeanio  wants to do the call on Tuesday as is July 4th weekend. I am okay with another time/day myself. Up to you.


[07/03/2022 6:57 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti @Armeanio Seems main priority right now is getting the Huobi listing done ASAP! If any issues, let us know so we can address. I am not sure what the result of listing there will be but it is possible will give us good boost and alleviate pressure so need to do it. Even if doesn't, its needed to show the community progress and show other exchanges Ergo is worth of listing!!


[07/03/2022 8:24 AM] mhs_sam#1471
Stacy wrote my team as Raffle. So this raffle thing is my team not in addition to that.


[07/03/2022 8:34 AM] mhs_sam#1471
I think it's possible for me to cut about 10% of my team's wages, maybe even more if the bear market continues.
one of the main reasons of funding was keeping the team while other blockchains have more attractive job proposals. I think if the bear market continues, other blockchains may have lower wages too and become less attractive. So it would be easy to cut to some degree.
On top of that, I can fire one dev after finalizing the Rosen bridge (next month) which will reduce the total amount by another 10% or so.
But, I recommend to keep it for at least one more month before any cut. If thing got worse we can talk about the cut.


[07/03/2022 9:01 AM] mhs_sam#1471
@Justin1000 I tend to agree with you to some degree. However, I'm afraid of a death spiral. We do not know when the market will melt up, it could be any moment. The community of Ergo have been built in a gras root way, which is the hardest but durable way. If we knock out the devs and community, we will absolutely lose the next bull market. I think the bear market is time to build and the bull market is time to harvest. So, we should be very careful about the signals we're sending to devs and community.

Anyway, the other side of these arguments is the Erg price and the budget. I think we should prioritize it over cutting for now. For example, can we get some loans, grants, paid partnership from anywhere? Specially, from IOHK? is there any way to pump the price using the legal ways for a short period of time, including our MM, to raise some USDT/SigUSD?

Personally, I think cardano and IOHK did not give us enough support and credit during the last years. Even in case of AgeUSD, the given credit is not satisfying. In their concurrency FUD, they could get more damage if there was not other EUTXO chains without this issue and it was not the ErgoDex's proposal and code to mitigate the issue for dexes. I can count a few more, including the data input paradigm (which will be included in the Vasil hardfork next month). I think we should work on this collaboration and receive at least some credit and community attention, even if they are not going to compensate this researches with grants, loans, etc.

[07/03/2022 9:18 AM] Justin1000#9555
Well that is basically what I am saying too though! No significant cuts needed right away just because the market is bad. Ergo fundamentals are better than ever and price could explode at any time and should protect what has been built and not reflexively cut spendings too much just because the "run-rate" is temporarily too high. For now, can just cut obvious waste and start being disciplined.

I think you make a good point on IOHK/Cardano. Maybe there is something that can be done there by @kushti / @Armeanio /Dan. EF has accomplished so much with so little and costs are so lean that even a relatively small amount of funding by Cardano standards could go a long way in this bear market. And Ergo has already done a lot pioneering DJED, having working UTXO smart contracts early etc etc and can do so much in future that might help, seems reasonable enough. Just listing on Binance alone might solve any problems at this point.

Lets have the next call focused on financial matters indeed. We need to consider how to make or fix SigUSD or USDT not just spend them.


[07/03/2022 9:40 AM] kushti#0978
Some listings can be cosponsored by good whale maybe, he promised to do that before at least


[07/03/2022 9:41 AM] kushti#0978
But negative media blast around Huobi making him afraid of this listing specifically

I agree with most of what @Justin1000 wrote. I myself already scaled down my work to the most important parts: basically v5.0 and supporting other devs (Benjamin, Koval, code reviews where my review is necessary, dev support in Discord). 
Regarding finances, I think we don't need to reinvent the wheel, we can follow standard accounting practices. 
EF as legal entity need to have Statement of Operations, Balance Sheet, Statement of Cash Flows and Payments Schedule for the next quarter. 
Creating this documents for 2022 Q2 will bring us all the necessary data to understand how long EF can survive with current assets, cashflows and market. Also we will be able to estimate what-if scenarios for extended bear market or possible market rebound. 
I think Anastasia should be responsible for this documents as she is dealing with accounting and payments already.
Here is a good tutorial on financial analysis with concrete instructions on how to prepare the above mentioned documents. https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU5mCJxo6JA6PW4ikI2dVOUoEOOWFkwLp

I don't know maybe XERO and the other software Anastasia is using for accounting already can generate such reports from entered transactions.

[07/05/2022 5:11 AM] Armeanio#0321
I think the one person who we should consider bringing onboard regularly, probably replacing Carlos P. is Allison. 

I have been funding things on out of my salary since december, Nautilus Wallet and the GraphQL explorer.

Also paying a second typscript developer to accelerate that as well.


[07/05/2022 5:17 AM] Armeanio#0321
Have a meeting tomorrow with catalyst about the potential to get funding for development.


[07/05/2022 5:19 AM] Armeanio#0321
My thinking is if we are going to reduce costs extra marketing is the place to start. I let the coinls contract expire that saves us a bit monthly. 

Paid articles and promotion can be replaced by community initiatives. 

I would personally rather cut my own pay than slow development as that is were sustainable value will ultimately come from.


[07/05/2022 5:23 AM] Armeanio#0321
Huobi is still saying list in mid-late July. 

Kraken is the next step that would be the first us exchnage with fiat bank transfers in the US. 

Imo it's a waste to pay for any more listings that don't offer direct banking, especially in current markets.

Fine with me


[07/05/2022 7:03 AM] Justin1000#9555
Looking at the budget data again sent by Stacie, its pretty clear that the problem here is not that we are spending too much but that our funds are not sufficient when ERG price drops a lot like now. We don‚Äôt spend much so I think there is limited gains to be had by cutting costs. Moving to more USD-denominated expenses when the ERG price goes a lot higher will yield the best long-term results in making the Foundation funds last.

So addressing the funding side could make biggest difference in short-term ‚Äì 1) higher price via exchange listings; 2) external funding via catalyst or some other sources.


[07/05/2022 7:04 AM] Justin1000#9555
If the Huobi -> Kraken path with exchanges is still viable over next 3 months or so, then I would say exchange situation is actually okay...anyway can talk about details on call.


[07/05/2022 7:25 AM] Stacie#8189
Unfortunately, I cannot join 1 hour earlier. What do you think to pushing the call for tomorrow, @everyone?


[07/05/2022 7:31 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think he means one hour LATER. So probably means 10 AM his time since the call was originally scheduled for 9 AM above.


[07/05/2022 7:49 AM] Justin1000#9555
So can still do today at 10 AM Mountain Time if that is okay with you.

@mhs_sam is there a latest update on rosenbridge ?  We need it now more than ever with the low ERG price. I understand Ergodex is launching on cardano late this month.


[07/13/2022 9:40 AM] mhs_sam#1471
pushing hard to be on testnet in a week. I'll provide more details by tonight.


[07/13/2022 10:50 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think it is highest priority we do whatever we can to help the Ergo price in the short-term. If the price stays at the current level or goes lower, I think some projects building on Ergo may give up or at a minimum continue to push plans back and work part-time. This will add to the negative sentiment. My proposed ideas to try and address this are below. 

I think we have 2 catalysts in near-term: 1) Huobi listing and 2) Rosenbridge cross chain with Cardano. And given low price we need to push to make absolute most of both.

[07/13/2022 10:52 AM] Justin1000#9555
* **Huobi ideas** (above is summary listing stuff @Armeanio  sent months ago):
-List ASAP and get marketing expenses lower ‚Äì it says ‚Äúfast track‚Äù above but that didn‚Äôt happen. In light of the slow listing and terrible market, hope they lower marketing fees to $100,000 in ERG.
-Coordinate with Huobi ahead of time to maximize marketing benefits
-AMAs ‚Äì its says 3 AMAs. Can we do all 3 of these in the 1 week after listing? Say one every 2 days after listing? First one could be the core team, then Ergopad Team, then Getblok.io. I doubt should wait as we need marketing now urgently so just do them all ASAP. And letting Ergopad team market will show Huobi people the ecosystem has a lot going on and also draw interest to their projects and already existing tokens which are struggling. People love to speculate and Huobi users will be more interested in Ergo if they know there are tokens and projects on Ergodex to trade.
-If that sounds interesting, good to start asking the Huobi team about it now. That will show to them we have interesting things to bring to their users and are keen to get the listing done. I can‚Äôt imagine Ergopad team wouldn‚Äôt jump at that opportunity.


[07/13/2022 10:53 AM] Justin1000#9555
* **Rosenbridge ideas**
-Get this done ASAP. Not only Rosenbridge team but also Ergodex team. @mhs_sam  do you need anything from them? If so, we should ask them now. And also, we should tell them that besides launching Ergodex on Cardano (I understand happening late July), their absolute #1 priority is getting Cardano-Ergo cross chain going via Rosenbridge. Ergo has supported them and we need their 100% support right now!
-As soon as goes live, think team should do a bunch of interviews with Cardano influencers to talk about Ergo, projects building on it and specifically cover Ergodex and purchasing ERGs on Cardano via Ergodex.
-The Ergodex team separately should also aggressively market this feature specifically among their Cardano community
-Someone should consider even asking Charles to briefly mention this feature if he feels comfortable (I am not sure‚Ä¶will it be the first cross chain swap on Cardano?)


[07/13/2022 10:54 AM] Justin1000#9555
The 2 biggest problems that have led to the low price is probably 1) lack of exchanges 2) lack of cross-chain. Both of these look like will be partially addressed in the short-term and we should make the absolute most of it. 

I am not saying we need to try and get the price to $10 in next 3 months in this terrible market. But if we can get it to say ~$3 with volume close to $1mm a day on average, everything will be just fine in the short-term. I think at these levels, Ergopad team can keep going strong and probably even bring a steady flow of projects. But ~$1.50 price and $300k/volume, things aren't good.


[07/17/2022 5:06 PM] mhs_sam#1471
message from Crypto Quokka:
"Hey mhs! Hope you‚Äôre doing well man. I‚Äôm messaging to ask if you know if the Ergo core team is looking for a frontend developer anywhere. I know I‚Äôm a fool for this but I quit my job a year ago to double down on Ergo and work on SkyHarbor so I took a big hit when the bear market occurred. And I guess being an anonymous dev doesn‚Äôt look good on a resume since jobs don‚Äôt seem to be responding to me lol. Just trying to stay afloat so I can keep working on skyharbor (and more ergo projects we have planned). Any help would be really appreciated"

idk what to say. we will see such messages more in the near future.

[07/27/2022 4:39 PM] mhs_sam#1471
what about creating a raffle for gathering some Erg while getting some community attention and social engagement?
maybe for 10-20k ERG (even more), while some funds are donated by goodwhale, Justin (I heard you want to donate), and community. I will donate 500-1k erg and will not charge for service fee. I guess for more engagement, winner's percentage should not be less that 5-7 percent.


[07/27/2022 4:53 PM] Justin1000#9555
I dont think we should complicate things this time myself. Rather just get the listing done immediately and move on.  This has already been outstanding so long and community just expects it to be delivered. And doing a raffle might raise concerns we don't have resources. 

That being said maybe could be a good idea at some point for reasons you mentioned. Armeanio had floated the idea before for Binance for example. Maybe should plan in advance though. For Huobi I think we should just get it done ASAP. Armeanio mentioned possibility of getting listing done on July 31.

We have the announcement set right now for July 31st so speed is probably an important factor in terms of a smooth rollout.


[07/27/2022 5:56 PM] Armeanio#0321
This is the current hurdle to plugging in with their marketing apparatus, we already have a gameplan in place but best to by in sync as things roll out. So speed probably is the most important factor here.

Unsurprisingly fed seems to be shifting. This could be the beginning of change in sentiment and better time than any in past 2 months to list on Huobi and start work on other exchanges. Don't expect a raging bull market but MAYBE worst is over.

@everyone


[08/18/2022 8:41 AM] morphic#4133
@everyone I have a problem which I hope EF and/or someone here can help me to solve. 
For my legal stay in Montenegro (the county I'm leaving in now) I had to register a new company and become its director, thus I have legal employment in the country. Based on this I have residence permit which will expire end of this year. 
Now, I have to make this company active (working contract and income) and profitable. If I will not make it profitable, I will not be able to extend my residence permit and my stay in the country will be questionable. 
 I have signed contract with EF, but EF cannot make USD transfer to my company's bank account.

I'm looking for ANY other company (legal entity) which can play the role of EF and which can pay USD for the work I do for EF. I need a signed contract and income payments via bank transfers based on invoices. 1.5-2K USD per month will be enough for this matter. 

If you can help with this or know someone in Ergo community who can help please help with contacting and signing the contract.


[08/18/2022 10:22 AM] glasgowm#9381
Presumably the Swift payments Stacie is able to make were not sufficient? Or not usable for some other reason?

I don't have the answer but I am also in this situation (I believe Armeanio mentioned greenhat is too) and need ~3mo of bank statements for a mortgage application. Maybe the EF could 'hire' ZenGate which in turn could employ us for some advisor role? I believe @Armeanio was wanting to create a IOHK-like entity to handle development for the EF at some point also.


[08/18/2022 11:53 AM] morphic#4133
The payment should come from business account of EF, Stacie did it, but then correspondent bank required EF to have IBAN, and according to Stacie, the IBAN opening application was rejected because EF have Russian resident among members.

The bank for my BVI entity was asking me a bunch of questions and generally being a pain (same bank that turned the EF down because had a Russian national) and since the Company hasn‚Äôt been active I told them I would close the account. So I probably can‚Äôt help as the account is expected to close soon. If I were to keep it open and say I was suddenly going to start paying a dev, might raise issues. Anyway, I will let you know if something changes but probably I won‚Äôt be able to help.

@Armeanio for adding members, when I tried to add filippounits along with mhs, we agreed to have like couple of months between addition. As you can see filippo is still not here


[08/21/2022 11:01 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think the Foundation‚Äôs central role is to deploy the funds from the Treasury. To the extent it is in a ‚Äúsad state‚Äù, I think it is mainly due to the lack of funds and that is due to us not liquidating ERGs when price was >$10. Need to make funds last (for years right?) so I don‚Äôt feel we have too much to deploy right now. 

But maybe you‚Äôre still right Foundation can do more and maybe Armeanio‚Äôs suggestion about adding new members and new responsibilities is a big step in right direction. Yes, exchange progress painfully slow. 

Overall I think things are going okay thanks to your, Armeanio‚Äôs, Glasgow‚Äôs and others hard work and the community is active on its own. The inflation rate is dropping, community building still despite bad market. Need to make sure when price goes back up, we don‚Äôt make same mistake on liquidations so this doesn‚Äôt happen again.


[08/21/2022 11:03 AM] Justin1000#9555
Regarding liquidations: price right now is low and I think short-sighted to do major liquidations here. Maybe best to just replace whatever USDT we are spending on a monthly basis for now. Then when price >$10, we should sell 100-200k ERGs for a more opportunistic liquidation so we have a war chest for future even if at time we are really optimistic about future price.

Regarding new members: I would think okay to add a member to legal entity if desired. Just seems risky to me to  add 3 at once as could be unforseen repercussions given its a legal entity after all. Maybe gradually as we feel comfortable. In meantime, can give people titles and responsibilities to get them more involved.

My thinking is just structure and roles for efficiency. All 3 are productive and have shown there isnt a need to babysit them and all have shown to be level headed. 

Ef is slowly improving but still messy in many areas. Marketing could be refined and more efficient we are always feeling reactive and behind things feel last minute still. 

With anon br the goal is to engage developers, lower the barriers of  implementation, sdks, and tools for building. More educational oriented. That helped drive a lot of community development this year.  Some level of developer advocate and support is needed I believe long term. 

Anastasia is just needed long term form payroll/secretarial/reporting purposes. Seems inefficient to not have that feedback present in decisions for every vote, budgeting and liquidation. Even if not voting power is given. 

Treasury management can be fixed. So far I think cutting usdt liabilities is a good short term step in current market conditions. 

I will work to improve market making and and setting better conditions for organic growth. 

Now I think is a good time to make the ef more efficient and put the system in place for when markets improve. 

To some degree we need to shift the mentality from a DAO to a company. That is my goal in the proposal.

Having additional members with refined roles/responsibilities that are doing well in this role already hopefully allows delegation of management in different areas. Makes command and control in different areas a lot more efficient. Inefficiencies seem to break down to the question who is in charge of what then things get less responsive when things feel leaderless.

Things tend to fall to Alex and well he is too busy for that. It's not a stress he needs.

Sounds great! Good job! And perfect timing ahead of the merge. I hope that we can pay ASAP. @kushti please help to arrange the payment as soon as you can (I guess immediately upon return from Dubai) so that the listing can proceed on Sep 8th. This has been outstanding for so long and after listing should be in good position to pursue other top exchanges. Probably with Huobi, we will be able to make good use of that balance $150k in longer-term especially if launch goes well. I guess @Armeanio will need to know when we can make payment so he can communicate this to Huobi ahead of time and manage their expectations.

Should it be paid from EF wallet or personal wallet is possible? I think when we have such a good deal we should not postpone it for a week since the price may change and it may affect their willingness.

We also need to pay 10K. This is for Kairon services this month.

I was not able to negotiate a lower fee for partial service unfortunately and did not want to pull liquidity from markets during recent price action as this could have led to unstable markets. 

I didn‚Äôt want to interfere with liquidity and momentum in the recent move, and didnt get things set up in time for a smooth handoff.

@MrStahlfelge wants us to decide on the naming for the mobile app.

@everyone 30 minutes


[09/08/2022 12:13 AM] Armeanio#0321
Dan and Charles had a meeting about Ergo. 

I guess Charles wants to try to take some big position in the Ergo ecosystem and plug in IOG Resources. 

Mostly an impossibly large position to capture, in terms of % which is unrealiatic.

Potential terms being a swap for ada. 

All kinds of promises in terms of listings, market access etc. @kushti has the most direct experience with these characters so I would default to his experience in considering this. 

An ada position would allow us to make part of the treasury a lot more liquid, if held in ada. 

Potentially we could also create some asks as well such as Rosen support, integrations, r&d etc.


[09/08/2022 12:16 AM] Armeanio#0321
On one hand it could potentially solve all market access and liquidity problems, on the other hand are the potential tradeoffs. 

Which @kushti might know more about having first hand experience there. 

Personally, I had to pause and ask myself what's the catch? But anyway passing this along to discuss.

Ill talk to the exchanges and see if they are interested in a swap in the meantime.


[09/08/2022 1:29 AM] CW#8500
Numerous potential positives as stated, R&D, resourcing, development, market access, networking, exposure and more. 

If an agreement is made to hold ADA then that also diversifies the treasury, more liquidity on ADA side and can provide ongoing funding from staking.

Now the questions arise, without too much detail yet... what's wanted in return? Governance control/majority in EF?


[09/08/2022 4:50 AM] Justin1000#9555
That‚Äôs good news. And not too surprising either as he has been big Ergo supporter and said himself ‚Äúsome day‚Äù he was going to take a position and build up the ecosystem. Also, Ergo‚Äôs combination of low market value, great community and best tech and devs in the industry (my opinion) does represent a tremendous opportunity for someone with lots of resources and a understanding of it. And can probably help Cardano too.

@kushti‚Äôs thoughts would be most important here. I see the benefits of him coming in as:
-Market access and exchange problem finally solved‚Ä¶just a matter of time
-A lot more users and new DAPP development
-Even more promotion by Charles
-More synergies with Cardano (a bigger ecosystem) that will aid in Ergo‚Äôs mass adoption
-Likely higher price and funding problems for EF solved


[09/08/2022 4:50 AM] Justin1000#9555
So big benefits. But I would say we need to be aware of the fact that from a market value perspective at least, IOG/Cardano and Charles are still much bigger than Ergo as a whole and many multiples bigger than the EF. We should try to mitigate any downsides. Possible ones include:
-Bigger misconception that Ergo is a Cardano project - already listed on Coingecko as ‚ÄúADA ecosystem‚Äù (this should be fixed‚Ä¶). I think Ergo should be distinct and open to all. 
-With such a big personality as Charles tied in with EF in major official way, may give impression he became the driving force of the EF and might hurt Ergo‚Äôs decentralization image.
-I doubt we should do large size swap for ADA. A significant position in ADA could lead to the EF having a conflict of interest. Also, ERG is very undervalued here in my opinion and we don‚Äôt have too much in treasury given how long it is meant to last. Charles should mainly get what he needs in the market.
-A too strong tie up with EF-Charles might make it harder for EF to cooperate with other ppl in crypto.


[09/08/2022 4:51 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yes, in theory given Ergo‚Äôs open permissionless decentralized nature, Charles can do whatever he wants without much from EF. But it would be good for us to help to extent we can without harming Ergo. Maybe he is wanting some comfort over direction of EF, wanting core dev focus on things he might think are important (and possibly so for ADA), establishing image of EF and IOG/Cardano working together. 


Anyway I for one WELCOME Charles into Ergo and I think we should be able to work with him in a way that addresses his concerns but also mitigates ours. Just need to establish 1) is there much validity to these concerns I raised; 2) what exactly is Charles concerns that a tie-up with EF helps address and 3) then how to work together to address both sides concerns and get something long-term and healthy started.

@kushti opinion most important on this since I think he has better grasps of potential upsides and downsides having worked with Charles so much. (I did meet him a few times myself btw).

It needs careful discussions and absolutely Kushti's opinion would be very important. 

one thing That I'm a little concerned about is ADA in our treasury. idk if ADA is security or not, or if they have legal opinion on that, but due to its ICO and PoS, it might be considered as a security in the future. 

If so, idk if holding ADA in our treasury will put EF in some unknown legal situations with SEC. 

My knowledge is very limited here, just saying my thoughts.

I am for working with Charles/IOG. But seems best for all to do it in a way that preserves neutrality and the perception of neutrality of EF. Things I can think of that might help with that include:
*Clearly defined scope of cooperation 
*Maybe make it time limited (say one year and can always extend anyway)
*Limited holdings of ADA by EF (we don't have many ERGs to "buy" them with anyway)

I think their acquisition of ERGs probably has to be mainly in the market (maybe they got started already in recent market weakness). We just don‚Äôt have that many in Treasury and has to last years.

[09/08/2022 12:07 PM] glasgowm#9381
This would be ideal. Or even CoinEx as they have a huge amount of ERG so would be good to decentralise it a bit.


[09/08/2022 1:42 PM] Armeanio#0321
Coinex wasn'interested, that was my first thought.


[09/08/2022 1:42 PM] Armeanio#0321
Kucoin has shows some interest.

For now lets sort out MM


[09/08/2022 3:40 PM] kushti#0978

Then can start transfer along with  @morphic


[09/08/2022 3:42 PM] Armeanio#0321
Ideally 5k usdt and 5k erg in volume in both. 

For mm account on huobi just erg. Maybe enough to raise the 200k proposal that passed.

I sent the login details yesterday

Will set up the volume account shortly.

Yes, we have usdt on gate only


[09/09/2022 10:23 AM] glasgowm#9381
@mhs_sam @Justin1000 do either of you have USDT at hand you could send quickly to open trading on Huobi?


[09/09/2022 10:24 AM] glasgowm#9381
or what is the alternative? They're waiting on USDT in the `Huobi <> Ergo` chat


[09/09/2022 10:31 AM] glasgowm#9381
Can we send half of this to Huobi and some more erg for them to cash out into USDT?


[09/09/2022 10:38 AM] Justin1000#9555
I got the USDT needed on two different exchanges. Guess could transfer in if needed.


[09/09/2022 10:39 AM] kushti#0978
Yesterday @Armeanio said no usdt needed


[09/09/2022 10:40 AM] glasgowm#9381
Unless there's another chat I'm not in they asked for 

`-Deposits for both accounts ($100k in USDT and $100k in tokens for mm account and $5k in USDT and $5k in tokens for the volume account))`


[09/09/2022 10:52 AM] glasgowm#9381
```
I don‚Äôt have the wallet address, a member of you team would need to provide that for you. 

Amount should be the equivalent to the amount you deposited in tokens: 

MM account
25k erg tokens 
100k+ in USDT 

Volume account 
1k erg tokens 
5k in USDT
```


[09/09/2022 10:52 AM] glasgowm#9381

$50k in USDT is the min amount


[09/09/2022 10:56 AM] Justin1000#9555
I have USDT 75k on Gate I could withdraw to them. The other exchange won't work I just saw.


[09/09/2022 10:57 AM] Justin1000#9555
But Gate can be slow to process withdraws sometimes. Not sure how long it would take to get there.


[09/09/2022 10:57 AM] glasgowm#9381
100 confirmations I think so ~2hrs+


[09/09/2022 10:58 AM] mhs_sam#1471
that's okay, I'll be in my office by then and will send the remaining amount

if min is $50k, are you willing to provide all of it? I'm fine with 50/50. No difference for me
lemme know and the quicker way would be if you send $50k and I'll send you $25k by night.


[09/09/2022 11:10 AM] mhs_sam#1471
actually $52.5 total


[09/09/2022 11:12 AM] Justin1000#9555

@glasgowm @Armeanio it is  disappointing that you guys are proposing spendings without considering current reserves. Please present now liquidation plan and timeline and work on it to understand how budgeting works. Consider ef debt before me due to usdt provided on kucoin. Please inform Anastasia about mm spendings.

[09/09/2022 2:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
wdym, I am considering current reserves. We've already agreed to Huobi so just doing what I can to get the listing launched on time as community not happy (and not a great look for us).


[09/09/2022 2:29 PM] Armeanio#0321
Trying to get us in a better position to fundraise. 

MM covered for a year, increased liqudiity on markets. Painful short term, yes but positioning for longer term stability is improving. 

This latest drama is unfortunate, but it doesnt change that end.


[09/09/2022 2:32 PM] Armeanio#0321
Sure  will work with Anastasia and Justin to structure repayment.


[09/09/2022 2:35 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah. I do recommend getting on CoinLS and making their top priority some liquidations and to tell us a concrete timetable. Not sure what is outstanding but if some is owed to Kushti, then probably priority of payments could be:
-First $50k USDT balance to EF (just to make sure we got enough to pay people that are owed salary payments in USDT...)
-Following USDT raised to pay Kushti until he is repayed in full
-Remaining to get EF to $200k minimum balance and pay me back

Given how dire the USDT situation is, good to do immediately. Not expecting price to dump but shouldn‚Äôt run any risk and volume is high enough I don‚Äôt think should be too difficult for them to do.

[09/11/2022 4:55 PM] Armeanio#0321
The initial request was completely unrealistic. They wanted like 5%.

I said impossible unless you visit markets, but I'll talk to exchanges about otc potential.


[09/11/2022 5:04 PM] mhs_sam#1471
5% of total supply? 5M Erg, or 5% of circ. supply? 3M Erg. 
both are impossible though. However, If otc didn't go well, can we have someone to buy this amount (or less) in the market and sell in otc to them? 
Might be an interesting opportunity for some guys.


[09/12/2022 3:52 AM] Armeanio#0321
@kushti do you have any opinion/insight to give here?

8 mst Tuesday @everyone


[09/13/2022 5:17 PM] Justin1000#9555
Regarding Le Yu, I paid a total of S$36,155 (was US$27,121 at exchange rates at time) for the set up. This included the Director fee of S$15,000 and the first year admin fees of ~S$2k. But it also included a S$15,000 Security Deposit that is meant to provide them a buffer in case of liability or unpaid fees. I was reimbursed already for this from EF.
I would note that:
-It is mentioned in the engagement letter the term is ‚Äú1 year from the date of incorporation‚Ä¶‚Äù
-In event any invoice remains unpaid for 5 working days, they can terminate the agreement
-Termination with 30 days notice
-The agreement maybe extended for a minimum of 6 months if mutually agreed

So probably:
-We will be getting back S$15,000 if all debts are paid so this should offset a significant amount of the cost associated with keeping the entity open for a little longer and winding it up. If this is repaid to an EF member (as EF still has no bank account), then they can reimburse EF in USDT equivalent at the time.
-Strictly speaking, the Term doesn‚Äôt begin until the entity was incorporated (Dec-2021 to Dec-2022). So probably we don‚Äôt owe them any right away. Although it is natural for them to invoice us now as it has been 1 year. And I would note they did a lot of work before the entity was set up.


[09/13/2022 5:17 PM] Justin1000#9555
I recommend:
-Doing everything by the book with the legal entity. Probably there will need to be accounting and financial statements for the period the entity was in Singapore. Should do our best to comply.
-Not getting rid of the Sing entity until an entity somewhere else is fully established even if we incur some additional costs. Probably the additional costs won‚Äôt be too much as the entity wasn‚Äôt even incorporated until December and Singapore isn‚Äôt too costly a jurisdiction. Something could always go wrong in new entity set up or some unexpected delays and we really need a legal entity in the interim.
-Try to keep Le Yu happy as we probably need their help to do a smooth transition.
-Hopefully can avoid paying them more director fees as term didn‚Äôt start until December. But if need to extend and pay more, 6 months should certainly be possible as implied by the Engagement Letter.


[09/13/2022 5:18 PM] Justin1000#9555
I sent the email with the Engagement Letters and expenses to @Stacie 's Yahoo email


[09/13/2022 5:20 PM] Justin1000#9555
Also, I would note that Jerald Siew from Dentons sent email on August 25th checking if we needed any further assistance and that they would proceed to render invoice if not -> Implies that the amount we paid them before they started work did not cover their actual hours used and they intend to invoice us for the balance.


[09/13/2022 5:37 PM] Stacie#8189
Thank you, @Justin1000. Well received. I will have a look and share a draft of email to Le Yu.

The EF has been offered a partnership with Waves Enterprise.

The details are a bit rough still beyond marketing on their side.

There is some potential for Oracle support/commercialization.

The EF could potentially run a node in their POS system and receive some incentive.

Wanted to run this by everyone and get initial feedback.


[09/13/2022 8:41 PM] glasgowm#9381
Don't we have an ongoing partnership with them already for this? or is this a different sector/team or something?

We would run a Node in their POS system and have some governance representation.

Spectrum launching token early to mid October. If we need to have any conversations with them about some tokens to EF or DAO now maybe last chance although I don't know their exact plans with the token.


[09/14/2022 11:37 AM] Stacie#8189
@everyone, I have read the Engagement letter and what I can add from my side:
- termination of the contract requires 30 days written notification. And in the event of termination, the fees already paid will not be refunded unless termination initiated by Client (EF) and the date of termination of the agreement is within first half of the term, they will refund such part of the fee as pro-rated in accordance with number of days remaining in the term.
- extension of the contact for minimum 6 months or such period as parties may agree too.

Due to aforementioned information, I suggest to ask below questions before any actions are taken:
1. Referring to the Agreement for Appointment of Nominee Director, the annual fees will be applied from 9th of December 2022. Hence, the payment needs to be completed by 9th of December 2022 despite the dates mention on the invoice. Is that correct?
2. Would it be possible to extend the Agreement of Nominee Director for 3 months? 
3. In case of company‚Äôs liquidation what would be the procedure and required documents?

Please, share your thoughts about the questions to Le Yu, so I can send an email to them.

Thank you

@mhs_sam made some rough calculations, there a lot of factors here so I may be wrong, but I think no more than 30-40 TH/s hashrate will come

Seems like a very small % of 'homeless' hash?

For ETH ASICs? I've seen 20-50% mentioned but yeah mostly unknown


[09/14/2022 12:37 PM] glasgowm#9381
Hash increase since Sept1, RVN 330%, ERG 200%, ETC 130%, FLUX 130%


[09/14/2022 12:45 PM] kushti#0978
that was in the long-term, hard to say about this moment


[09/14/2022 1:01 PM] mhs_sam#1471
30-40 Eth's TH/s? that means about 100-120 TH/s in Ergo. (current 25+120 influx)= 130-150 TH/s means 6-7x minimum for Ergo.

ref: 3060 makes ~40Mhs for Eth and ~120Mhs for Erg (depends on GPU, but for a rough estimation)

Or, you mean 30-40Ths for Erg? that's about 2x for Erg. I guess 5-7x is more realistic than 2x atm.


[09/14/2022 1:06 PM] mhs_sam#1471
Last time we survived a 10-20x misconfiguration, right? however with some additional subsidies.

What do you mean? It's not reactive to what we need?


[09/14/2022 2:30 PM] kushti#0978
5x is ok , as hashrate won't drop to the current level after spike. A lot will depend on how quickly hashrate will arrive


[09/14/2022 3:47 PM] Armeanio#0321
Hard to say anything clearly the merge and migration.


[09/14/2022 3:48 PM] Armeanio#0321
How would you like to see it in sync differently in the future?


[09/14/2022 3:59 PM] mhs_sam#1471
@glasgowm said: Does this problem potentially go away if we have a big price boost to sustain miners/difficulty?

my response: short answer Yes.
long answer, we might not have any problem at all. 
first we will have some influx, that will cause the blocks to be mined faster, that's not an issue. 
then the diff will be adjusted to rise block time to 2mins.
then the miner's income will be reduced, then they will leave for another more profitable chain.

here resides the potential issue. the blocks will be produced slower, depends on who much hashrate leaves. during this period if the price does not adjust properly, more miner will leave due to even lower income.

to my understanding, the probability of being stuck is very low. actually the initial influx is not much important as the leaving hashrate after that.  

if the hashrate reduces by around 5x-7x factor, we will not see any issue and the diff adjustment will kick it in the next epochs.

[09/14/2022 4:02 PM] mhs_sam#1471
in case of any issue, the very first response could be some bonus Erg from EF to the miners. like what @kushti did in the previous HF. That will solve any potential issue with a very good chance.


[09/14/2022 4:03 PM] Armeanio#0321
We have a certain flywheel where thing accelerate and delay too much with adjustments being slow. 

Let's see maybe this ethpow fork will act as a buffer. Hard to say. Ideally it does then implodes once we are larger/more stable.


[09/14/2022 4:04 PM] Armeanio#0321
If subsidies are needed we can vote on it. I think it maybe needed as an emergency measure but let's see.


[09/14/2022 4:05 PM] Armeanio#0321
@kushti I really need support with MM api in kucoin. 

Pinged you in that channel on telegram. I have no access to make the necessary changes.


[09/14/2022 4:05 PM] CW#8500
Yes agreed, a lot is currently reactive and responding to things in real time. 

Current aim internally is to get structure in place where our different marketing avenues are talking with each other. Had a good start with this in notion. 

Next is getting a long term focus in place so we can plan campaigns and be prepared for up coming announcements and events. Not leave things last minute and scramble to get information out. 

Importantly we need the head talking to the tail also to streamline this process. Have time to get all the ducks in a row so to speak. 

So at the moment quite focused on making this ErgoHack a success through previous decisions that have been made and then we can be a lot more focused on planning and paving a direction forward

[09/14/2022 4:25 PM] CW#8500
Regarding the Merge. This is just unprecedented times. Never has this happened in the industry, everyone has had the luxury to grow hash over a long period of time to where we see it today.

This is all going to be switched off in the coming hours and needs a home.

Taking ASICs out of the equation say 50% remaining is GPU's, that's ETH equivalent to 430TH (or 860TH in Ergo HR terms) that needs a home. 

There aren't many meaningful options here to absorb that HR. ETC will be smashed with ASICs, FLUX is reasonable but different use case than us, RVN is just well RVN. Outside of that is a number of smaller projects and miserable coins. 

Trying to take confirmation bias out of the equation here but Ergo on a fundamental bases is strong and well positioned in terms of miners making the switch 

As with all PoW projects, the sudden and immediate influx of HR with tank profitability. Going to all need a huge appreciation in price to make mining viable and profitable short term. 

We also have the difficulty adjustment to contend with. Like mentioned, we can prob absorb retail at this stage and see a 5x in hash rate. That is still a drop in the ocean to what's available out there when thinking about it in terms of ETH hash rate.

If the big players make the instant jump then I dont know what to say. Shit hits the fan? 

Ideally we see a small and gradual increase but with the hard flick of the switch there is a potential tsunami of HR coming, just hope the large players park their HR and allows difficulty to smooth over and not jump in and out of Ergo causing the difficulty to go haywire


[09/14/2022 4:26 PM] CW#8500
This is an important point and should be prepared for because it is unprecedented and should be prepared for all scenarios

We definitely need more people in charge of explorer servers, this area demands quick responses to issues, unfortunately this is not what we are seeing now.

The ideal solution would be to ask one of our devs to help on it, not sure if we have someone with DevOps experience. 

Any thoughts?


[09/15/2022 1:45 PM] anon_br#2282
@everyone


[09/15/2022 4:16 PM] morphic#4133
Ideally some community project take care of hosting and maintaining explorer either for free of for some donations (maybe even from community). 
EF can organise annual fundraising campaigns (the same way as ErgoHack is organised) to fund Explorer maintenance.


[09/15/2022 4:20 PM] morphic#4133
Explorer providers should  be somehow incentivised to provide good service in order to receive funding.


[09/15/2022 4:22 PM] morphic#4133
In general I think we need to find some decentralised way of running explorer business. Any centralised organisation will eventually fail.

Yes, indeed, that's a good goal and definitively something we should pursue.

[09/16/2022 4:47 PM] kushti#0978
I think now pricing becomes most important thing in short-term, to hold hashrate, and not absolute price even but relative to etc and rvn. So short term focus should be on aggressive promotion I suppose, there is real chance to get to top 100 now

I'm afraid so, we still have room for plenty of optimizations, some easy to do like index optimizations, caching, query rate limiting, et cetera.

Last time I heard, it was taking ~5 seconds to include a block, recent index optimizations will improve that.


[09/16/2022 11:54 PM] anon_br#2282

[09/17/2022 10:30 AM] morphic#4133

[09/17/2022 4:21 PM] morphic#4133
The problem with explorer is that it is perceived as a kind of second-class task in ergo ecosystem. It is not core protocols and it is also not concrete application, always some kind of supporting role.


[09/17/2022 4:23 PM] morphic#4133
Every node release or wallet release is widely advertised, I don't remember any advertising of explorer releases and how impressive new feature it brings to the community.

It is just an explorer.


[09/17/2022 4:25 PM] morphic#4133

[09/17/2022 4:28 PM] morphic#4133

There is indeed a lot of small things that can be done in explorer to improve the situation in a short-term, but in a long term someone from community need to show up and take ownership towards transforming explorer to something more decentralized.


[09/18/2022 11:20 PM] kushti#0978
Explorers are always very heavy, we tried to bootstrap some Bitcoin node with additional indexes used as an Explorer backend, back in 2015, and to get synced in reasonable time, 1 terabyte RAM instance was needed


[09/18/2022 11:21 PM] kushti#0978
Dunno how such things can be decentralized


[09/19/2022 9:30 AM] mhs_sam#1471
I think decentralization should be defined here.
AFAIK, there could be 3 proper definitions here:
1- having several instances of the current explorer. This avoids single point of failure. This is happening now and a few community hosted explorers are available.
2- having several implementations (at least one another). 
Again, this will avoid single point of failure. In the new implementations, different dbs can be used.
idk the requirements, but seems a quick way can be integrating with well-known explorers. I saw Cardano is being supported in some of them. Maybe there is a quick way to be integrated with them.
3- having some lightweight explorers to be used alongside each node or dapps. These explorers are not indexing the whole chain and probably will provide a limited but highly-used set of APIs.

maybe it's time to deploy some EF funds to defend the hashrate. At the time of writing, the remaining blocks to diff adj are 345 blocks, minting 16560 ERG. Probably deploying 4-5k Erg is needed. @everyone


[09/23/2022 8:20 AM] mhs_sam#1471
alternatively, or at the same time, we can rent some hashrate


[09/23/2022 8:33 AM] Armeanio#0321
I think it is a good idea to get through this epoch


[09/23/2022 8:34 AM] Armeanio#0321
Too much drama and negative pr around this.

Could be some positive marketing I think. Miners are kind of rallying in support. Best to support that effort.

I do not think we should sponsor miners this time


[09/23/2022 9:02 AM] mhs_sam#1471
can you elaborate the reasoning?


[09/23/2022 9:04 AM] mhs_sam#1471
I'm not sure if we can count on the current existing hashrate to remain in the network in the next 3-4 days. If they stay, the epoch will end in 3-4 days.


[09/23/2022 9:05 AM] mhs_sam#1471
however, if it drops again (50-60% drop in the past 3 days), it would be a loop of dropping hr and extension of epoch


[09/23/2022 9:07 AM] mhs_sam#1471
anyway, the vote is more of a subsidy fund to be in your hand, since the voting always take some time.
For any epoch we can do a quick chat here while the fund is still remaining.


[09/23/2022 9:11 AM] Justin1000#9555
I dont think we should do it unless really necessary. The community needs to be resilient and it's great to see some miners stepping up to get through this. The EF won't always be able to bail out the network when exogenous events happen. Especially given our funding situation. 

It sets a precedent we should avoid unless necessary. 

That being said we should monitor carefully and if looks like a real risk of hash rate death spiral happening then we should take action. I can't form an opinion on whether we are at that point yet or not as haven't run the numbers unfortunately but I see blocks are chugging a long still. If hash rate looks like is stabilizing at close to this level the network should be fine right?

Can deduct if from my rewards moving forward  if needed.


[09/23/2022 9:15 AM] mhs_sam#1471
If hashrate stabilize at ANY level we will go through this. However, we might go through a loop of decreasing hr and extension of epoch. The shit didn't hit the market fan yet, if it does, maybe the situation will be more dramatic.

I think the only precedent that matters is just post eth. That is a one time event.

I have pretty much the same arguments as Justin. Can change opinion in case of drastic hashrate drop maybe but that should be mean of last resort


[09/23/2022 10:04 AM] mhs_sam#1471
I see and agree. 
however, I think we are at that state. 
also, I think doing this is much disciplined and cleaner than begging the miners to stay:

actually, the situation could be quickly more dramatic if the price declines. Much harder to recover then.

As hashrate turns off or moves away from Ergo, block times increase thus extending an epoch.

To assist short-term, point hash rate towards Ergo to help reduce adjustment time

Erg is asking for help to bring the diff back down and get to the next epoch.
Twitter


[09/23/2022 10:06 AM] mhs_sam#1471
unless we can have some private deal with a few big miners.


[09/23/2022 10:07 AM] mhs_sam#1471
or, if we can do sth for price. A 20-30% rise will do the job for this epoch. But it looks harder to me.


[09/23/2022 10:11 AM] Armeanio#0321
At least in asking and putting skin in the game it shows some solidarity. Imo.


[09/23/2022 10:12 AM] Armeanio#0321
You can call that marketing or branding.


[09/23/2022 10:12 AM] Armeanio#0321
Also buys time. That might be most critical.


[09/23/2022 10:14 AM] Armeanio#0321
That's more political than practical. But builds confidence and buys time.


[09/23/2022 10:20 AM] mhs_sam#1471
In either cases we will be in a loop.
- a death spiral at the worse case could happen and recovery will be much much harder.
- a loop of subsidizing might happen. but it will buy us at least one month of time for a few thousands of Erg. during this time we can do the HF if necessary, which seems to be necessary.

since the price is lower than post merge, and since the diff is higher, the situation might be better in the next epochs. Probably we will not see another 10x influx here and then a 90% outflux.


[09/23/2022 10:24 AM] morphic#4133
According to https://ergolui.com/ergo_diff/ergo_diff.htm we are already in a death spiral unfortunately. The Time until the next epoch stays above 60h for 2 days already and the HR is dropping.


[09/23/2022 10:26 AM] morphic#4133
If we can buy hash rate it may be better option as we will return some coins back.


[09/23/2022 10:27 AM] mhs_sam#1471
I checked nicehash, only less than 3Ths available for about 0.03 daily. needs kyc though.


[09/23/2022 10:27 AM] morphic#4133
I'm quite sure now we need to fix the adjustment algorithm


[09/23/2022 10:30 AM] morphic#4133
Then we need to do both. The sooner we finish this epoch the less we lose.

Difficulty adjustment at regular time intervals
One observation about diff adjustment.  The main issue with the current diff adjustment is its asymmetry and not the algorithm (or specific formula).  It quickly adjusts to hash rate increase, but it is disproportionately long to adjust when miners leave. This is because the moment of recalculation depend on block number and the more miners leav...


[09/23/2022 10:36 AM] Justin1000#9555
Well, if we are at a real risk of a death spiral already, then I think we should do the subsidy to head it off the best we can. Like Kushti says, I would also prefer to wait until seems no choice but perhaps we are there already because unpredictable things can happen and the situation deteriorate rapidly if not addressed. MHS and Armeanio are closer to the miners so should have better feel of how they are reacting.

I can see how PR can matter here and is not just for marketing purposes. For example, we want to avoid losing pools which would just aggravate the situation. And better to do something before they leave then be reactive after they leave or threaten to leave.

But this is unfortunate. Would be better if was community led funding to split costs with loyal miners. But that seems highly unlikely to be practical, especially in needed time frame.

time is critical


[09/23/2022 11:54 AM] mhs_sam#1471
thanks for voting quickly. As it is voted yes rn, let's act accordingly asap. We agree on dedicating 20-30k Erg to this issue. The actual spending of this fund needs no voting anymore. Let's do a quick chat (if necessary) on discord and subsidize miners in each epoch that is necessary. 
For this epoch, I suggest waiting a few more hours and then act due to the situation.
we can do this things:
- buy hashrate from service providers like nicehash
- private deal with a few large enough miners
- subsidizing publicly using the pools (not limited to getblok)


[09/23/2022 12:13 PM] CW#8500
This is the purpose of my Tweet. While not a practical long term solution, it is rallying the community to contribute and feel involved. More PR than anything else. 

I haven't ask or begged any individual person, yet the engagement from miners has been encouraging, though not sustainable as majority are mining with losses.


[09/23/2022 1:45 PM] glasgowm#9381
Hash rate has regained a little ground. Think the calculator is a bit deceiving for time and slow to reflect current situation; if you plug in the numbers manually we should be fine even with a 5TH/s drop each day. But yeh it is pretty close to the edge and a price drop due to macro conditions is my main worry.  

I think around 1.8TH/s is available on NH and we should just grab that first if possible. How much TH/s do we have access to via private miners?


[09/23/2022 2:09 PM] glasgowm#9381
Miningrig rentals has 3TH/s


[09/23/2022 2:38 PM] mhs_sam#1471
seems way more expensive than NH


[09/23/2022 4:02 PM] Armeanio#0321
Vote passed @everyone we need to get the subsidy in place as hashrate is still stable


[09/23/2022 4:07 PM] mhs_sam#1471
it needs a good plan.
we should sound like we stand with miners, we know they are in loss, everything is in loss however, the situation with Ergo is a bit worse, so thank you for supporting ergo. While we're working on an appropriate solution we have your back and will cover a bit of your loss.

[09/23/2022 4:08 PM] mhs_sam#1471
btw, any miner you know with enough hr? if so, we can subsidize them privately

I don't know any farms already enough


[09/23/2022 4:10 PM] mhs_sam#1471
another solution is to subsidize only one pool, f2pool for example in private. They can use the fund and we can keep it private that the fund is from EF. Will look like that they are supporting the network.


[09/23/2022 4:10 PM] mhs_sam#1471
possible with any pool?


[09/23/2022 4:20 PM] Armeanio#0321
I can ask f2


[09/24/2022 10:36 AM] mhs_sam#1471
we're good for now it seems, the hashrate raised and stable. 
btw, f2 is on 3% fee. would be great if they can lower it somehow

And for doing a fork, execution is needed, communications with pools, getting them updated, doing voting maybe, notify exchanges, wallets, ecosystem dapps, enthusiasts running the nodes etc

awesome job tbh. I think we are in a good position of marketing and communication to accelerate the upgrade.


[09/24/2022 1:19 PM] kushti#0978

[09/24/2022 1:20 PM] kushti#0978

[09/24/2022 1:22 PM] mhs_sam#1471
based on the sentiment, another kind of vote can be if they upgrade or not. by definition Ergo will be chain with higher hashrate. so they can vote by upgrading or not. We should work on how to sell it as a miner voted upgrade by default.


[09/24/2022 1:24 PM] mhs_sam#1471
two more questions.
- what about the initial diff? does it matter?
- what about versioning? it should be 5.x or what? anyway nothing very important


[09/24/2022 1:26 PM] mhs_sam#1471
also, if we wanna vote like eip27. should it be during a fast epoch or a slow one?


[09/24/2022 1:28 PM] kushti#0978
Version will be 4.x, as 5.0 is reserved for jitc soft fork already


[09/24/2022 1:34 PM] kushti#0978
Manually set initial difficulty maybe not needed


[09/24/2022 1:34 PM] kushti#0978
Depends on activation height


[09/24/2022 1:55 PM] kushti#0978

[09/26/2022 1:48 AM] CW#8500
I'm of the opinion we should be proactive now with incentives, try to increase hash rate (or at a min, maintain current hash) to get through this epoch. 

Buy some time to get HF prepared and improve sentiment without it getting to the point of another HR bleed and increasing epoch time scenario

I'll dedicate all available time to assisting with HF

[09/26/2022 5:50 AM] Justin1000#9555
Sounds interesting. Before starting, I think we would need to have a strategy for how to use it and get the most out of it. 

A ‚Äúholy war‚Äù with ETC could generate a lot of noise but I tend to initially think it is not right way to go:
-ETC not really ‚Äúenemy‚Äù here‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt have much adoption besides speculation and at least tries to stick to the first principles of crypto ‚Äì I liked ETC a lot before losing hope it would ever get mass adoption (I actually traveled to some ETC conferences and saw Charles speak at one)
-A lot of pro-PoW and other key industry players are invested in ETC‚Äôs success
-Not really consistent with how we do things (although maybe Ergo team being so ‚Äúnice‚Äù has slowed down adoption)

Maybe can consider focusing on promoting Ergo to ETC crowd and others by highlighting how Ergo also sticks to first principles and PoW. ‚ÄúIf you like ETC, then you will love Ergo as it is next generation and solves a lot of ETH problems while sticking to principles ETC holds dear‚Äù‚Ä¶although would not sure how to balance that without highlighting too many deficiencies that ETC has at it inherited many of the fatal flaws from ETH. But can make it more of pro-ERG, pro-ETC, anti-ETH platform as ETH has abandoned PoW, is centralized in multiple ways, sets monetary policy by committee, etc. Primarily contrast Ergo to ETH rather than with ETC. I have no issue with attacking ETH hard.

Just some initial thoughts. I am no expert in managing a twitter account! In any case, if do attain control of it, should use it however benefits Ergo the most in short and long-term.

Yeah, number of different angles to approach any given way someone will be upset, the principles approach rings home and the direction I'll go with.


[09/26/2022 9:33 AM] mhs_sam#1471
ETC when it created is different from ETC now. To me ETC is a dead horse. Yes it was sth about first principles but as there was no active development there, it became a useless chain and only speculation. 
It's hard for me to believe that there are still a lot of people with hope/care about ETC. So I do not think we should care much about differences with ETC and that we have same culture.
CH did a vid about ETC and called it dead, choose ERGO. I think we should continue this narrative. ETC is dead, come to ERGO.


[09/26/2022 9:39 AM] mhs_sam#1471
Also, now almost all ASIC on ETC, I doubt if it's attractive for GPU miners. So, we're not going to attract ETC lovers to ERGO, if there is still sth like ETC lovers though.
We should sell it as a support from IOG, CH, Cardano.


[09/26/2022 10:08 AM] glasgowm#9381
Not sure how we could use the ETC account that wasn't in bad-taste tbh


[09/26/2022 10:19 AM] mhs_sam#1471
anyway, you sure about the this handle? I guess it is the one that ETC really has control over it.


[09/26/2022 10:33 AM] CW#8500
Yeah, I'm sure. Charles has always had ownership of the account. At the moment he has allowed some minor activity on there but he still has full control and ownership. 

Dan called about an hour ago to discuss this. Charles reached out to him this morning saying he wanted to hand over the account to us. 

Quick FYI... On Twitter, your following is tied to the account, not your handle. You're at liberty to change the handle as you see fit on your account.

Messaging is important. I'll discuss when they're available to do a hand over. I'm just waiting to hear from them


[09/26/2022 12:14 PM] CW#8500
So how it works, 
Delete etc_classic handle on the 600k account
Add ergoplatformorg handle and update the profile, clean up current etc tweets on 600k account

On our 64k account, we could update that to ergo foundation handle

Or for the time being I created ergo_platform to park there if needed

Need to discuss potential terms etc for a Charles H/IOG partnership prior to meeting him in Vegas and Denver.


[09/26/2022 3:57 PM] mhs_sam#1471
"I think an IOG partnership with rosen has much better optics. " @glasgowm in hard-fork group.

I think partnership should be general and not project specific, maybe area specific like bridging, sidechains, etc. But not project specific as rosen, spectrum,...


[09/26/2022 4:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
good point; but yeah partnering in regards to bridges is probably our best bet atm as it's fairly tangible for most people and a bit closer than sidechains.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[09/26/2022 4:13 PM] mhs_sam#1471
I agree, but partnering with Rosen benefits Rosen. We should put the benefits on EF side.
Based on an agreement we can pave the road for them to invest and partner with ergo projects like rosen, spectrum, exle, etc. All of these projects have their own tokens. 
Also, there is no official dapp here, failure or success of a project should be separated from EF. On the other hand, why they should partner with Rosen and not Aneta for example. It's against EF neutrality. 

btw, It's still unclear for me what's the partnership about. If it's not a grant which seems not, there should not be specific obligation here.

Simply, it can be that IOG wants to invest in Erg, so they can buy in the market. when they have a position in Erg it could benefits them when Ergo prospers. Based on that, we can work together in some specific areas of research and development like cross-chain, bridging, dapps, eUTXO researches, Oracles, stable coins. 

Also, seems they need some methods for trustless checkpointing (if I'm getting it right) using PoW. Researches like Minotaur and ofli are relevant. We can benefit them in this area.

Hi @everyone. Will try to join, but a bit later. Sorry for that. If I will not be able to make it, I will give a heads up in the group by writing


[09/29/2022 10:25 AM] Noah ~ Ë¥∫ËÉΩ#5674
ETC Twitter account; might be good to: 

1) Phase One, transition period (maybe a few days or weeks).  Keep the ETC name and branding. While it is still branded as ETC, the account promotes Ergo and essentially announces something to the effect that "CH did a vid about ETC and called it dead, choose ERGO."; but would have to be very careful not to piss off CH since the branding is still under ETC (if give control to Ergo in this Phase).  Then, maybe after waiting some period (days?), announce that the account will be changing to Ergo. 

2) Phase 2: Rebrand to Ergo. Full control to Ergo (if not already in Phase One).

Weird if followers wake up one day and see the account just suddenly switched to ERG. Just for consideration, I know nothing about Twitter marketing.


[09/29/2022 11:49 AM] glasgowm#9381
I think doing it like this would open us upto legal issues and probably lead to FUD too


[09/29/2022 1:25 PM] CW#8500
Its tricky and starting to work through details around it at the moment. Have a unified front regarding the background of handover. 

The handle itself will be returned to the etc community. 

The gents I'm working through this with are quite slow to respond but will keep everyone updated

We are looking to avoid mentioning anything through ETC, think like Mark mentioned it'll add fuel to the fire


[09/29/2022 4:08 PM] morphic#4133
I think we need to be honest with the followers and tell what happened (provided CH is ok to make it public, otherwise we better off using this account at all). 
And we want them to NOT press that Unfollow button.
We can tell them the account will have a new name and will tweet about UTXO blockchains. The name can be neutral and don't mention any concrete blockchain. 
Then we can use it to promote eUTXO, ADA, ERG, UTXO Alliance etc.
We can then measure the conversion of users from etc_classic to ergoplatform. (I'm not sure but it should be possible by comparing lists of users of both accounts and find the intersection)
Once conversion is done the etc_classic account can become silent.


[09/29/2022 4:32 PM] Justin1000#9555
The ETC user base is one of the best targets in all of crypto for Ergo. The transition for them will mainly be away from account model/solidity to EUTXO/ErgoScript. So some good entertaining education on that front early could be good to peak their interest and retain followers.

I hope the account is just for Ergo and Ergo promotion from now on. Only mentioning other blockchains to the extent it furthers that goal. Seems to be general idea from what I gather above and this could possibly replace our current main twitter account but leave details to CW.

[09/29/2022 10:43 PM] CW#8500
CH isn't wanting to much attention at this point, he will get that no matter the direction. We have had some progress over night.

I'm pushing for a short, concise message to convey the account transfer as simple as "IOG/Charles believes in our mission and is gifting ownership of the account to the Ergo Foundation" and IOG/CH releasing a short PR or CH vid explaining his/their reasons. 

1. After taking ownership, I will rebrand the account and change the handle to "@ergo_platform". 
2. Directly following this I will transfer the "@etc_classic" handle to a holding account and will transfer those details to Bob Summerwill
3. First tweet mentioning the above statement or similar
4. Tweet @etc_classic handle has been transferred to Bob
5. Start the community engagement -- education, polls, awareness, olive branch to ETC community etc.
6. Move forward with promoting Ergo and the ecosystem

Looks like we will be handed the account by the end of next week (at this stage)


[09/29/2022 11:37 PM] mhs_sam#1471
do ETC guys already know about this transfer?


[09/29/2022 11:40 PM] CW#8500
No, not yet


[09/29/2022 11:40 PM] CW#8500

[10/01/2022 3:06 PM] mhs_sam#1471
block time is going crazy high and hash rate is down to 20Ths (even sub 20). 
about 310 blocks remaining in this epoch (14,880 ERG), I suggest using/adding some funds to accelerate this epoch.
I think subsidizing chosen mining pools will not be effective because mostly current miners will migrate to them without any noticeable overall result. 
Maybe a bonus for all block finders? 

Or, a similar idea that I executed in the previous epoch? 
we can **randomly ** create txns with high fees for miners to treasure hunt them.


[10/01/2022 3:13 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah...this is frustrating. Maybe just a big subsidy to get this epoch done and keep it simple? Seems at end of epoch, HF should be done and can finally resolve this. I think that:
-should be generous enough to resolve the problem with high confidence
-should be made clear it is to Epoch-end only (a one-off)
-all pools
-pools and everyone should market it to get miners on


[10/01/2022 3:14 PM] mhs_sam#1471
yeah, simple and powerful


[10/01/2022 3:22 PM] Armeanio#0321
I think a subsidy would be good.


[10/01/2022 4:29 PM] mhs_sam#1471
@everyone  so let's do it. how many Erg?


[10/01/2022 4:54 PM] CW#8500
I can't see what the exact proposal on the forum, if 4-5k ERG was agreed upon that's roughly 1.33x the current block reward or 15 ERG addition per block up to the next epoch


[10/01/2022 4:56 PM] mhs_sam#1471
agreed on up to 20-30k Erg if necessary. That was before EIP37, so we do not need that much.


[10/01/2022 4:56 PM] mhs_sam#1471
so yes, 4-5k Erg is doable.


[10/01/2022 4:59 PM] Justin1000#9555
Probably should err on generous side to make sure problem resolved. Good to get it resolved quick too. But don‚Äôt want to make it look excessive. Would +48 / block be too much? So 100% bonus. 

If too much, maybe go with +50% bonus? (24 ERG)

The mining calculators online imply that may not even be enough to get miners to profitability but I don‚Äôt know what electricity costs for current miners are. If ~$0.05 kw/h, guess will be roughly sufficient.


[10/01/2022 4:59 PM] CW#8500
Possible to do 50% if that's the case. 7.5k ERG


[10/01/2022 5:00 PM] mhs_sam#1471
Also, I have bot in hand that is enable to create a self spending txn with any desirable fee. It is currently paying every other block, but I think it's possible to do it for every block. so no need for manual payment.


[10/01/2022 5:01 PM] Justin1000#9555
That sounds good to me...


[10/01/2022 5:04 PM] mhs_sam#1471
I think we need at least 30-50% hashrate increase. This means we need at least 30-50% bonus. However, when that 30-50% increase in hr occurs the profitablity for the whole miners will be like now. So I think for an X% increase in hr, we need at least 1.1X% bonus.


[10/01/2022 5:05 PM] mhs_sam#1471
what if we really use the bot as it is now, so it's X bonus minable in every other block? I think same effect of hr increase with half fund.


[10/01/2022 5:07 PM] mhs_sam#1471
example of it for the last blocks of previous epoch:


[10/01/2022 5:07 PM] mhs_sam#1471
https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/addresses/9gRqfAe8nsdT9FweH8U4SeyHP75op95qrmrxT2TwPkAjUdrkRDD


[10/01/2022 5:09 PM] Justin1000#9555
But they will factor that in if every other block right? So won‚Äôt be sufficient perhaps?

Maybe do +75% bonus per block to insure sufficient and get the epoch finished relatively quickly? Would cost around 10k ERGs. But presumably with the difficulty adjusting down + HF, the problem will be solved and just a one-off.


[10/01/2022 5:14 PM] mhs_sam#1471
they can factor that but how they can react? they have to stay an mine. one block has 48ERG and the next block has 48+48Erg for example. doable with about 7200 ERG.
the other issue is that, I have to check exactly if it's possible to do it for every block, without paying 2 fees for one block accidentally. I have to check.


[10/01/2022 5:15 PM] mhs_sam#1471
but yes, for pool mining it can be factored, but will be more attractive for solo miners.


[10/01/2022 5:17 PM] Justin1000#9555
Oh, I think I misunderstood. Yes, giving say 100% bonus every other block, I would think they should calculate as 50% bonus probably. Although maybe a little risk they could switch that quick given the longer block times and a little more muddled message but could be worth it to save hassle of paying each pool. 

I would tend to think to give a little more than we think needed is best strategy. So if we think +50% bonus should be enough, go with 75% probably.


[10/01/2022 5:18 PM] Justin1000#9555
Well if 50% is enough, I guess its enough. Just don‚Äôt want to have situation where we have to up it later or something goes wrong. And paying a little extra gets side benefit of faster resolution.


[10/01/2022 5:22 PM] mhs_sam#1471
okay, I found a solution. I can run two instances of the bot with one block delay. In each block one of them is paying bonus fee.


[10/01/2022 5:22 PM] mhs_sam#1471
so lemme know the percentage and method (all or every other)


[10/01/2022 5:23 PM] CW#8500
Yeah I agree. +75% (~11k ERG) is still conservative as to what was initially agreed upon

[10/01/2022 5:26 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah, I would say go with decisive solution‚Ä¶so +75%. Every block is better but if it‚Äôs a big hassle/delay to adjust the bots and you don‚Äôt think the switching chance is too high between blocks, guess every other block is okay too.

Yeah sounds good to me, whatever you think is best. Not many blocks to go


[10/01/2022 5:30 PM] mhs_sam#1471
paying with one bot is impossible in all blocks since I have to check if it's mined and when I've verified that the miner is already built his candidate.
but, it seems pretty feasible and easy to run two bots. I can confirm in a few minutes.


[10/01/2022 5:31 PM] mhs_sam#1471
okay then, so first options is to pay 75%*48=36 Erg fee in each block.

[10/01/2022 5:56 PM] mhs_sam#1471
yeah it's doble. there is tiny chance that two txns get mined in one block. I guess nothing to worry about. 
lemme setup the bots and I'll tell you @CW to tweet.


[10/01/2022 5:57 PM] mhs_sam#1471

Almost ready. sending funds to the bots now.
then I'll try to sync the bots with 1-2 smaller fee txns. Then start. 
I guess you can announce it, telling that it will start in a few blocks

not yet. funds sent but not mined. As I said, it takes 1-3 blocks in order to make sure of syncing them (with lower fee)


[10/01/2022 8:22 PM] mhs_sam#1471
not bad, we can announce and miners have some time to change the miners, hopefully

eip37 will be activated in that block?


[10/01/2022 10:15 PM] kushti#0978
Likely yes


[10/01/2022 10:16 PM] mhs_sam#1471

[10/01/2022 10:17 PM] kushti#0978
Not 77


[10/01/2022 10:17 PM] kushti#0978
Yes


[10/01/2022 10:17 PM] kushti#0978
Activation protocol set in 100


[10/01/2022 10:19 PM] mhs_sam#1471
so can we say that we'll continue this bonus till eip37 activation and not after it or 844799


[10/01/2022 10:22 PM] kushti#0978
Or whatever comes earlier


[10/01/2022 10:23 PM] kushti#0978
As on 844801 there will be lower diff anyway


[10/01/2022 10:23 PM] mhs_sam#1471
yeah, I meant that exactly


[10/01/2022 10:24 PM] mhs_sam#1471
@CW you can add another tweet and say this. In case of eip37 activation before 844799 the offer will end immediately.


[10/01/2022 10:24 PM] CW#8500
yeah on it


[10/01/2022 10:25 PM] mhs_sam#1471
please send it here first


[10/01/2022 10:27 PM] CW#8500
In the event of EIP-37 activation prior to block 844-799, the block bonus offer will cease immediately.


[10/01/2022 10:28 PM] mhs_sam#1471
seems good to me, anything else to add? @kushti


[10/01/2022 10:43 PM] mhs_sam#1471
please tweet, alex confirmed it


[10/01/2022 10:44 PM] CW#8500
sent


[10/02/2022 8:11 AM] mhs_sam#1471
FYI, I stopped the bots last night after a few blocks. mempool is full and new txns hit the mempool slow and unpredictable, resulting in missing some blocks.
I'm on a new method of payment (alex said it) that is pretty easier and deterministic. So, I'll send the 36 Erg to prior miners and current one soon.


[10/02/2022 12:01 PM] mhs_sam#1471
payment resumed with different method:
https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/addresses/9gRqfAe8nsdT9FweH8U4SeyHP75op95qrmrxT2TwPkAjUdrkRDD

the missed payments will be payed later manually.


[10/02/2022 12:22 PM] mhs_sam#1471
starting from block 844527 bots started creating txns paying 36Erg fees, some miners were unable to collect this box so we stopped the process.
starting from 844576 bot is paying 36Erg directly to the miner's reward adrs.
missed block b/w 844527-844576 will be paid manually later

A lot of people are complaining about the twitter. They are entitled to their opinion but the main point for me is we didn‚Äôt take the twitter for THEIR benefit! We did it for the benefit of Ergo as a whole and for the benefit of the people that haven‚Äôt heard about Ergo or barely have and will because of this. Marty seemed to be making a similar point.

So these people complaining think that the new people who are going to hear about Ergo solely because we did this don‚Äôt deserve to or should wait for who knows how long until it happens another way? If they got a better way to get hundreds of thousands of people to hear about Ergo now at no cost then they should tell us. 

Ergo is built for mass adoption. It‚Äôs not their toy to play around with in a small community.

Just my opinion...I think it would help if we can show them the Twitter account can be used to actually bring in new people into Ergo and educate them and is NOT just a number.

[10/07/2022 11:20 PM] CW#8500
Yes agreed, it'll take a little time on the education front and this initial noise to die down but long term it's a net win. 

Short term, the account has seen an increase of followers since we have taken control. 

Regarding account details, who in the foundation would like log in details? I can provide them but also have 2fa set up. If anything happens, I also created a separate email address registered for the account which I will also provide the log in details for


[10/07/2022 11:22 PM] CW#8500
Do we have a foundation bit warden account? If not I will create one with all the social account details in there


[10/08/2022 7:52 PM] mhs_sam#1471
we need to end that shit, getblok is calling for vote via miners, heh. ErgoNation is calling for onchain vote. A few ergonauts are ruining the possible gains for the transfer


[10/08/2022 10:35 PM] anon_br#2282
Yeah, pretty ridiculous reactions. At the moment, the best we can do is just wait and try to manage the situation as best as possible, drama will eventually pass when the community finds something new to talk about. It's matter of time and patience IMO


[10/08/2022 10:37 PM] mhs_sam#1471
Not sure if it's a matter of time actually. ETC has no community and no huge noises on tw but this is the ergonauts ruining the whole benefits and credit of this action.


[10/09/2022 1:07 AM] CW#8500
We knew some would be outspoken as expected, im surprised by some of the more predominant members' reactions tbh.  

Taking control of the account was a strategic decision, we have been mentioned in a coin telegraph article and others, and a lot of people are talking about it. The account is growing by followers and engagement metrics since taking control. From the guerilla point of view, it certainly has made an impression. 

People push for their individual moral or ethical persuasion which does not necessarily align with strategic business decisions

{Reactions}
üëç (3) 

[10/09/2022 10:14 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah, they don‚Äôt have responsibility for making any strategic decisions or being obligated to think long-term about what is good for Ergo and can say whatever they think feels good. And also not considering how challenging marketing is for Ergo on a shoe-string budget. I would think that:
-100 people could come to 100 different conclusions about who is right and who is wrong about the account history between Charles and ETC ‚Äì not our job to judge this and I think is irrelevant.
-As far as I can tell, Charles wouldn‚Äôt have utilized the account at all and it would have went to waste if not given to Ergo.
-So our decision should be if having the account is good for Ergo‚Äôs long-term or not. 
-Think Eva makes a good point. This account could be immensely beneficial for Ergo adoption in a bull market. 
-If we did return it, it would just be going back to Charles since it belonged to him and not ETC. They already have their handle.
So in actuality, Foundation didn‚Äôt do anything here except accept a gift that should be a valuable resource for Ergo. We didn‚Äôt do anything to ETC! They can take it up with Charles and stop whining to us.
At Ergo Foundation, we don‚Äôt have any Fiduciary Duty to do what is good for ETC or make moral judgements about stuff we have nothing to do with. Just a duty to do what is good for Ergo. So I think from our perspective it is simple analysis about whether this gift of property from a supporter of Ergo is good for Ergo or not long-term.


[10/09/2022 10:15 AM] Justin1000#9555
Also, the English telegram group is not the only community. The Chinese community is really happy about the Twitter account. They would think we were border-line crazy if we gave it back to Charles.


[10/09/2022 10:16 AM] Justin1000#9555
But I admit, I could be missing something and am not expert on twitter. For example, someone said Musk might get rid of all the bots and make the new twitter account of no value. Sounds like speculation to me and I am not even sure how much of the users are bots and how many are just inactive in a bear market.


[10/09/2022 10:35 AM] mhs_sam#1471
I'm sure we made the right decision, no doubt for me here. My main concern here is that so much ergonauts are against the EF decision. ETC community seems empty and no serious voices from them is heard, actually seems no one is there. Some ergonauts are doing their job.
I think we should hardly insist on our decision and somehow put an end to this debates. Any hesitancy here will put us in bad situation and makes challenging our future decisions easier.


[10/09/2022 10:38 AM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah. My biggest concern is what I see as their irrational backlash causing damage.

And also have thought maybe we should tell them the decision is final and to move on.

They don't have to agree with everything we do. The EF is just one part of the ergo ecosystem. And honestly not too huge either with only 1% of total token supply remaining in EF.


[10/09/2022 11:56 AM] glasgowm#9381
what about changing the twitter to ergo foundation and giving the old one to the sigmanauts?


[10/09/2022 12:12 PM] mhs_sam#1471

I think they will need Rosen.

 Sidechain collaboration is a potential as well


[10/12/2022 7:54 AM] Justin1000#9555
Guess is obvious but anything we can do to get the price up within next month or so would be most welcome. Either exchange listing, Rosen, announcements or something. Always hard. But the price at this level drains our treasury too fast and also makes it hard for ppl building on Ergo.


[10/17/2022 1:50 AM] CW#8500
Hi all, Dan has reached out looking for a detailed dev roadmap for the next 6-12 months in relation to a CH proposal - do we have something that extends passed 5.0 on the direction we want to head for say 6.0, any other improvements etc. whether public or otherwise?

@Armeanio @kushti , what do you think of doing the Spectrum call? If want to do the call Monday at 1030 PM HKT, I can circulate zoom details. Or would you prefer to discuss it on the weekly call amongst ourselves first? TGE date is Nov 21.

There are some issues with taking SPF tokens like custody we need to think about.

I thought best to catch up with them on a call and get on same page on everything. I wouldn‚Äôt be focused on the SPF tokens except for the fact that at this low ERG price the EF doesn‚Äôt have sufficient funds so any help can get is good.

Hey, quick update from what I've mentioned previously in EF meetings regarding Twitter accounts, we held a Sigmanauts meeting this morning and discussed numerous topics including the Sigmanuts group utilizing the "@ergoplatformorg" account to highlight their initiatives and ecosystem as a whole.

We have been in a holding pattern to see if anything negative were to unfold on that account from Twitter Support after receiving custody of @Ergo_Platform. 

The plan at this stage is to 
1. EF remain in custody of the account and allow access via TweetDeck to post Tweets, likes, retweets etc. as they see fit. I have spoke about the need to define a tone for messaging and consistency no matter who is providing content.
2. Change the handle from "@ergoplatformorg" to "@Sigmanauts" (already reserved)
3. Park "@ergoplatformorg" on an account directing all traffic to "@Ergo_Platform" and continue to build the audience
4. Treat @Ergo_Platform as more of an ecosystem update/educational/awareness tool.

The benefit of granting control to Sigmanauts is it gets the user base of that account informed and active once again, removes confusion of multiple Ergo handles and provides the Sigmanauts a significant platform moving forward.

Is this something we support?

In any case, we retain custody of the @ergoplatformorg account and handle


[11/07/2022 10:50 AM] Justin1000#9555
This sounds good to me. I do strongly recommend remaining risk averse in terms of what Twitter might do so the EF retaining custody of the old one but letting Sigmanauts use it sounds perfect. In unlikely case, Twitter at some point suddenly says we can‚Äôt use the new one, we should be able to reclaim the Sigmanauts account or otherwise decide the best way to use it for Ergo at that time.

@morphic have you informed jozinek on payments restructuring? The guy has sent an invoice again, luckily, @Stacie has not paid it. Please resolve the issue ASAP


[11/08/2022 11:29 AM] morphic#4133
I told him month ago and the termination date is 15.10.2022. 
I think we should send him an official letter of cancelation of contract.

I will hook shortly


[11/22/2022 1:26 PM] Justin1000#9555
I hope IOG is planning on doing something soon on the partnership. Ergo needs the support in the bear market and as we are working on the slides for introducing Ergo to Company/Funds etc, I realize even more Ergo represents a tremendous opportunity for them.

IOG can be first mover and get big advantage and best returns as a result but I think we can attract other larger groups and funds too (which will also add value to IOG's participation in Ergo), using the deck as an intro. At least, that is if IOG does indeed come on board in a major way. Else, probably still take time to attract an appropriate big player.

For our institutional targeting, probably in order of likelihood/probability/benefit, type of investors to target are below:
1) Companies/Funds with deep crypto experience and own development teams who will not only invest in Ergo but build on it and market it etc. Might devote their own developer resources even to build out infrastructure ‚Äì Ergo is HUGE opportunity for such groups. -> of course IOG is such a group
2) Crypto specialist VC funds who might be willing to invest in ERG and also fund projects building on Ergo and help promote Ergo
3) General crypto funds who just invest money and don‚Äôt build or participate too much in ongoing stuff
4) Family offices/institutional investors who might be willing to take a punt but not going to add much value otherwise


[11/22/2022 1:27 PM] Justin1000#9555
Without anyone from group 1, the other groups will be hard to attract and of lesser value if attracted. Although someone good in group 2 might also work as a start. 

In any case, at this point in Ergo‚Äôs development, I think top priority is targeting these types of ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù rather than the normal crypto users, non-crypto users and other individuals. Those guys have already had plenty of opportunity to get involved in Ergo like our existing community. And individuals tend to follow the big names anyway so we need to get some in and could use their relationships too.


[11/22/2022 1:30 PM] Justin1000#9555
Once the presentation is done, we can make a excel based list of targets and update it as we go along specifying such things as type of institution, basic description, whether we have sent deck or not, initial feedback, whether we have had a call or not, feedback from call, etc. We probably shouldn't immediately shoot the deck out to dozens of investors or institutions right away of course but start compiling a list and targeting by priority. If nothing else, hearing their feedback could be potentially valuable. And I think with us being spread around like we are, we are in good position to reach out to investors all over the world from Asia to Europe to Middle East to US.


[11/22/2022 1:44 PM] Justin1000#9555
And lastly...it might be good timing to start a dialogue with such institutions. Should be more clear than ever to smarter investors/institutions the value of real decentralization and ethics in crypto. They may look at Ergo much differently than they would have in 2021 with all the centralized garbage attracting billions of institutional inflow then now getting burned.

Hey all, sorry for missing the meeting last night, the fam is a little unwell atm.

Quick update on marketing side. 
Editorial - Number of articles in the pipeline
* ErgoHack V results/recap
* MultiSig
* Updated Ergo Handbook with eip27 tokenomics/projects/wallets etc
* Babel fees
* Ergo roadmap part 2
* Cex/Dex released targeting crypto novices (note the mistake not mentioning spectrum - being amended now)

Events
* Wrap up of ErgoHack V with release of article above
* Started prep for next ErgoHack. 
     - Targeting early Feb to take into account xmas/new years/chinese ny. 
     - Topic to be decided, a number of options, ZK/Sigma protocol products, green button solutions, education, addressing regulation, NFT utility, grassroots finance
* Amend judging rubric
* Discussed with Armeanio of creating a weekend ecosystem hack where a project is identified needing development of "nice to have features". Project main focus has mainly been on core functionality, running something like this where incentive is provided by the project to have a weekend to attract devs from all over the community to build out the "nice to have features" built out greatly improving UI/UX. Idea still being fleshed out

Socials
* Sigmanauts have been provided access to utilize the "Sigmanauts" account. They're still identifying who will take the lead here so i have been doing some likes/retweets on it for the time being. 
* Ergo_Platform - I was wanting to shift focus from for this to be more core orientated but with the ecosystem still needing exposure I will go back to my original strategy highlighting things going on in the ecosystem

Ecosystem
* I've reached out to numerous projects privately asking them to up their community engagement. Mentioned this publicly for the first time yesterday in Ergonauts channel. Many have/are relying on us to do a lot of the lifting for them. Many are doing well, some have started and others not so much.  We need the ecosystem to find its voice!

[11/26/2022 6:05 AM] Justin1000#9555
Its past time we began our institutional outreach. If nothing else, we need to do whatever we can to address the price issue. Ergo at $1.40 is an abomination and so something is wrong here. It is going to be a drag on the ecosystem and development, although Ergo is showing a lot of resiliency to the terrible price and the #240 ranking.

We need to keep a very organized process here of investor targeting and discussions. Essential everything is tracked in sheet above (please someone add to google docs for easy updating).

Process should be:
1)    Possible investor identification
2)    Contact investor and see if they want to get deck. Most will say yes. Few investors will turn down chance to look at an investment at all, especially if we have some relationship with them.
3)    After they get deck and have a look, we see their feedback and if they want to do anything more.
4)    Probably majority will want some sort of call or discussion at this point. 
5)    Do the call. Here need to make a judgement on who from EF needs to be on the call. If it is a Tier 4 investor and just a call with one member of team, then its likely can just be a one-on-one call with whoever from EF has the relationship. But if on the other hand, it‚Äôs a call with a big very experienced VC fund and they are bringing their technical team on, then we should have 3 or 4 guys from EF on including @kushti even if it is a first call.
6)    After call, get feedback. If first call was really just exploratory then might do a bigger call with more team members on. 
7)    For interested investors/Companies, we will then need to flush out how we can help them participate in Ergo and how they can help Ergo.


[11/26/2022 6:08 AM] Justin1000#9555
I started the targeting list. These are just my really initial targets. Just by myself, I expect to be able to gradually fill out a strong list of targets over time. I haven't focused on building such relationships lately but will do so now.


[11/26/2022 6:12 AM] Justin1000#9555
Already got some good names who want the deck like Hashkey and Draper.


[11/26/2022 6:13 AM] Justin1000#9555
Also:
-I think even Tier 4 is worth targeting early on. A smart financial investor if they see an opportunity might have a strong relationship with a Tier 1 or Tier 2 that they can then loop in. We don't want to persuade Tier 3 or 4s to throw money at Ergo. BUT if we get a good Tier 1 or 2 involved, then Tier 3-4 will be in good position to participate. And they maybe able to get the Tier 1 or 2 in themselves.

-What happened with JKL? Are they for real? If so, I should be put in contact with them ASAP.

-I will be thinking of more targets including Tier 1s. Eva is gonna do some research on domestic China players who might still be active. But main thing is getting some dialogues going ASAP because the people we reach out to may be the best source of other targets! And its going to take some time to flush out how interested institutions can get involved.


[11/26/2022 6:20 AM] Justin1000#9555
On presentation:
-I think it is looking excellent. Have a hard time believing that most investors who read it will not at least be intrigued. Although, going from interested to actually getting involved might not be that easy as we know Ergo is not set up so much for institutions by nature.
-We should get it done ASAP. @glasgowm  I recommend finishing the main prez (almost done!). I will look to do something on the valuation page ASAP. Then we should just do whatever can with appendix to make it presentable and lets start sending this out. Then work can continue on appendix to improve it and can make it better. But that doesn't have to be perfect for starting discussions.
-Appendix ‚Äì looking good but needs more flushing out (can do later!). Will be great to have as reference and during discussions, we might ask investors to flip to x page in appendix to check out individual project(s) on Ergo to illustrate a point. But this will depend on particular investor interest and how the discussion is going.
-I think prez can be sent to exchanges. Do we have contact at Binance? Just before sending, should check to see what slight alterations need to be made to avoid any weird things like opportunities to investors or whatever. I can look for new contact at OKEX because I believe Shirley left.
-Eva will translate into Chinese as soon as its done.


[11/26/2022 6:24 AM] Justin1000#9555
NOTE: the sheet above is important. not just targeting but a feedback sheet. so whoever conducts calls and reaches out to investors should update the sheet as it happens.

Thanks. Updated for Isola who also will take a look at deck. They aren't a great target for a standalone investment but could have some strong relationships. And will be good to get their feedback.

Message from Robert Kornacki: 

"Hey Alex, long time no talk. Hope all has been well for you in the past couple years
Just reaching out to see if there's potential interest from the EF for dcSpark to potentially get some grants to either:
1. Add Ergo support to both Flint Mobile/Flint extension
2. Build ecosystem infrastructure that's open source
We potentially have some available developers and as such we're currently looking at a few ecosystems to see where it makes the most sense to put their time and/or divide it between multiple ecosystems"


[11/30/2022 4:26 PM] kushti#0978
Does not sound good to me based on prior experience


[11/30/2022 4:30 PM] Justin1000#9555
What do they need grant for? He knows Ergo inside-out. If he thinks it is a real opportunity, they should just seize it and start building (and I am not sure why they didn't start earlier). Probably EF would be happy to help where we can from a dev/marketing perspective but if they see Ergo as so little potential they need money from EF to work on it, then I see no point. We don't have funds for it anyway.

Unlikely, shocking irresponsibility was shown in the beginning of 2021. 
At some point Nico told me they are jumping off as they did a lot for $XX,XXX , when I asked why 5 digits and not more he said they are using valuation from the moment of receiving the grant. Erg was about 20 cent back then. They held ERGs though, and during the talk ERG was like 50x more expensive. For many years in crypto and tech in general I never seen rubbish like that.


[12/01/2022 6:03 AM] Justin1000#9555
I think if IOG partnership happens we should have a group conference call with dcspark to discuss future cooperation. No EF grants though. But IOG could be catalyst to restart discussion.

But should have whole team on so including Armeanio, me, Glasgow. And their side. 

Robert knows ergo really well. I guess they lack vision though.

Wow, Arthur said would kick it to his head of investments to kick the tires on. I told him we would be ready to help if they need anything. Please everyone be very responsive to top investors like this if they have questions or need anything! Top priority I think right now.

Now I think about it...they might be perfect. They probably don't have the traditional pump-n-dump VC approach and Arthur has always been a out-of-the box thinker. Anyway, its just a first step but definitely a top priority as they will have great connections to investors, exchanges, third parties of all sorts etc. So if they do show some interest, should do whatever we can to get them over the line as they can solve a lot of problems...

Maybe you can have a quick look and see if it is worth your time to give some quick feedback on his paper and if his points are anything new to you. Sorry I put in telegram DM...just too many people I don't know who are in the Dexy chats and didn't want to clutter this up.

He may have some good investors contacts. One is liquibit but could be others. But I am a little sceptical he will turn out be useful though. But not sure.


[12/11/2022 11:52 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti Not sure what you are trying to accomplish by criticizing the EF in public? Or are you intentionally trying to make sentiment worst and make people lose confidence in the EF and also hurt the ERG price worse and make doing business on Ergo even worse? 

I am sure that is not the case so I suggest in the future when you feel the need to say something negative about the EF or the overall situation in general in public, you just don‚Äôt. Or at least moderate and add caveats and consider it carefully first. 

And am not sure what you are so disappointed with about the EF given the resources it has?

Lastly, @kushti @glasgowm I feel like I mentioned before but this is not the time to be overly ‚Äútransparent‚Äù unless you want to tell the community:
-EF has limited funds
-Didn‚Äôt raise any USDT when it should have
-Has debts etc etc

Does that sound like a good message to relay right now? What do we owe this Koutelier guy?


[12/11/2022 11:52 AM] Justin1000#9555
I thought EF was going out of its way to help Sigmanauts.


[12/11/2022 11:54 AM] Justin1000#9555
Best to get the situation favorable again then I'm all for transparency. But the EF has never been overly transparent. To choose now as the time to do it doesn't make a lot of sense!


[12/11/2022 11:58 AM] Justin1000#9555
Anyway, things are just fine for the moment:
-we have SPF funding (subject to confirmation exactly how much that is going to be)
-we can do moderate cuts
-most people seem motivated and working for low ‚Äúsalaries‚Äù anyway for the moment because believe in Ergo
-it‚Äôs a bad market and normal for things to be difficult

Can‚Äôt getblok.io just come back when the market returns? Everyone seems to be overreacting. I already mentioned that doing business on Ergo was going to be very difficult if price goes to $1 or so. So no one should be surprised and overreacting. Its crypto after all‚Ä¶


[12/11/2022 12:04 PM] Justin1000#9555
Worse than getblock.io I am sure is all the projects not coming to market or not functioning at close to 100% due to the bad conditions. Should be expected hence all our efforts to help things:
-Constant video content
-AMAs
-Reaching out to big names
-Setting up sigmanauts
-Partnerships
And other stuff.

Flux is also WAY down.


[12/11/2022 12:19 PM] glasgowm#9381
I think GetBlok would've shut-down regardless of a cash injection. They could've asked for a grant or done a raffle but seems they wanted to part ways with arohbe/cheese sticking about to continue work on SNIPs and on-chain smart-mining.


[12/11/2022 12:21 PM] Justin1000#9555
It seems the future of the EF is being decided in the Ergonauts chat spontaneously? This is ridiculous.


[12/11/2022 12:23 PM] Justin1000#9555
I blanked the EF targeting sheet. I don't want to be sharing confidential info about contacts and people we are reaching out to until I know what the status of the EF is.


[12/11/2022 12:23 PM] Justin1000#9555
Saved the info elsewhere.


[12/11/2022 12:24 PM] Justin1000#9555
And I think I won't be continuing conversations for now. When was the EF decentralized? I missed that part? The EF is a centralized point. That is the whole point of it. @kushti public criticism of the EF opened this whole line of conversation and then proposals are being made to radically change everything on a chat with 70 people?


[12/11/2022 12:25 PM] Justin1000#9555
I proposed possibly making the EF decentralized long ago. Its always a desirable thing but only in the right circumstances and those circumstances never arose. I fail to see how when the EF treasury is way down and are in bear market semi-crisis, now is the right time to make radical changes?????


[12/11/2022 12:26 PM] Justin1000#9555
I thought the plan was to have the sigmanauts gradually take over. GRADUALLY. maybe I am missing something. anyway i will wait for someone to clear this up.

[12/11/2022 1:58 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah the goal was to build up the structure of the Sigmanauts and slowly shift responsibility there (and funds if appropriate). Maybe retain the EF for a legal entity & core research. All being discussed and progressed in the Sigmanaut‚Äôs chats at a reasonable rate (considering lack of DAO tooling). But yeh a gradual process.

Not sure either what is to be unhappy about with EF performance. Communication certainly, maybe finances? But also restricted by communication there, give me or someone responsive to requests #deleted-channel  @kushti so I can let stacie in, set up more structures for community governance, etc. Please be clear and give us a heads up so we know wtf is going on.


[12/11/2022 2:13 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yes, the situation with the Sigmanauts seems straight forward to me:
-It‚Äôs an awesome initiative that is going to lead to great decentralization and a parallel org to EF and we can figure out how to pass it resources and responsibilities (i guess possibly most of those in the longer run if desired)
-But it is just getting started
-It has to get organized
-It has to prove it can operate to some degree smoothly and effectively before getting entrusted with a lot of funds
-Then it has to get funding. EF can maybe do a lot here if things turn around with price in short-term else the Sigmanauts are probably going to have to make due with limited resources for a while

In my opinion, the EF is performing fine. Kushti has gotten frustrated in the past about EF and he may have had good reason to be but now with Armeanio, Glasgow and CW all communicating well and putting out content and even the Sigmanauts coming along just fine, I see absolutely nothing to be overly concerned about except the things we can‚Äôt control which is the market and how investors perceive ERG. And we are doing what we can there as well.

Anyway, I am waiting for an explanation from @kushti  why he feels he needs to criticize EF in public and propose changes in public wihout any discussion within EF first and whether he wants to continue doing that. If that is the direction we are going in, I just don't know what is going to happen to EF. I guess we need to sort out what our plans are.

It's always been my understanding with the Sigmanauts and the EF involvement that we are here to assist/consult with Sigmanauts to help them set up but have 0 influence over the group. 

It is why, since joining the EF, I have taken a step back and watch what they're doing. Provide input when requested. 

They're a seperate, community-run organization from the EF. Different entities, a one-off $50k contribution from EF was floated a while ago when markets weren't so terrible for them to set up and manage.


[12/11/2022 7:04 PM] CW#8500
Regarding the public comments made of the EF or any of the members, it's disappointing. Raise it here. Make people aware


[12/11/2022 10:39 PM] mhs_sam#1471
It was a very long thread on tg so I read it briefly. One thing that I did not understand is that why there is a need to REPLACE/Decentralize EF. 
The plan was to create a DAO or Sigmanaut or etc that gradually takes the funds and the responsibility in a distributed manner. Koutelier's proposal can be considered as a way to fund that entity.
They can do whatever they want in parallel and it does not require the EF's approval.

[12/11/2022 10:49 PM] glasgowm#9381
Originally thought he meant a DAO to let users spend the EF by voting with ERG but what he's describing just sounds like a Raffle with predefined outputs so don't see how it'd gain significantly more use than the Raffle does.


[12/11/2022 10:50 PM] glasgowm#9381
what's the script with the dev updates @mhs_sam - will there be one this wk? Even if not much to report saying that and commenting on testing better than silence community starting to get a bit antsy. Can one of your team members not give it if you arent available?


[12/12/2022 3:01 AM] Justin1000#9555
Just from my side, I cannot continue to reach out to investors/Companies until got clarity on public criticism of EF and EF‚Äôs status going forward. Big reputation risk for me. Say get 1 or 2 big guys interested and they come in and see the lead core dev (who the community all looks up to) criticizing the EF publicly and a bunch of community members talking about wiping it out/turning it into a DAO or other nonsense, I will look like a fool after telling them how great Ergo is. Those guys want stability and will want to know the EF situation, funding, its plans etc. Before yesterday, think we had good answers to all that ‚Äì see my spread sheet on burn rate incorporating SPF tokens etc. 

-I guess like chance of ~20-25% of getting some good VC funds into the ecosystem in short term (60-90 days) - its a bad market and Ergo is not the most easy sell. **These guys might prevent things like what happened to Getblok and more importantly help get some of the projects that are on the sidelines off the ground.** 
-Probably ~50% chance in next 6 months or so depending on how other things go.
-Even if no success at all within ~6 months, could pay long-term dividends. The deck is already read by some big guys so that raises Ergo‚Äôs profile - then when Ergo starts taking off can re-approach and be like "I told you so" and they might come in big then and add a lot of value.


[12/12/2022 6:13 AM] Justin1000#9555
My friend is introing me to the Seed Round guys that came into Spectrum now. Just talking to Cogitent (LA based) and Riviera (think also California) so far. Seem welcoming as impressed with Spectrum! Anyway I will continue the conversations but good to get clarity on above.

Investor Update:
*So far: 25 targets identified (20 VCs, 1 crypto hedge fund, 2 tradfi funds, 2 other (mining pool and exchange).
*Have contacted 19 targets with deck sent to 12 targets. 
*Based on initial response or lack of response, have moved 7 parties to the low likelihood (low but they could still come around and longer-term still reasonable chance)
*At this stage, no advanced discussions I would say. Mainly a little back and forth on email/telegram and ppl reviewing deck. Probably initial discussions I will handle and then if still interest, bring in broader team. 
*Confident we will be able to reach out to quite a few more targets. Just today I have gotten intros via friends to 3 additional funds: GSR, Platinum Fund, Contango.
*But things are going to slow down after this week due to Christmas holiday. Most likely will be little activity/progress from Dec 19 ‚Äì Jan 5. Trying to get deck in hands as many as possible this week ahead of that.
*The odds might not be that bad of getting some involved in short-term. Just challenging because sentiment on the ecosystem is poor at this moment (#240 rank) and many investors surely dealing with big losses right now. If next 2 months, sentiment improves for Ergo, then odds go up a lot. And they will be impressed with Marty if they talk to him.
*I of course have not mentioned any potential upcoming partnership nor will I. Although if get to advanced stage of discussion with a big firm that can bring a lot to the table, I might just say there is a potential partnership with a development firm that could add value to the Ergo ecosystem. Strictly no-names and limited info until we all decide if we should take it farther.

@Armeanio, As mentioned ahead of time, I wanted to take a shot at reaching out to Wang Chun and seeing if he would support Ergo hence the direct telegram @. Obvious had some risk of annoying them but felt downside minimal. Anyway, feel free to blame everything on me so you can maintain good relations with Leon and I of course have no further intention of trying to reach them. 

Separately though, note that Tan knows half of their team of 30 in China. And knows Shen Yu (the other #1 guy along with Wang Chun). In theory, we could make a proposal on cooperation (say they help us with Exchanges/KOL/Investor Contacts and we help them with increasing their share of Ergo mining through marketing etc).

But 1) I suppose we would want to make that proposal first to US guys you built relationship with in the first place else risk pissing everyone off then only if they didn‚Äôt respond could go to Shen Yu. 2) I kinda doubt its all worthwhile. I am not sure exactly how much help f2pool can really provide so maybe we shouldn‚Äôt bother with any of this unless they show real enthusiasm for Ergo first. 

I will leave f2pool at that unless you think we should try something of the above.


[12/14/2022 2:56 PM] glasgowm#9381
Was EFYT sold? Was a discussion in Ergonauts but nobody responded me so not sure if I'm interpreting right. Don't want to be giving out bad info.

> Ergo-First-Year-Token was airdropped and distributed on Waves DEX, starting with a 100,000 EFYT airdrop in May 2017. EFYT served the dual purposes of helping build an early community of stakeholders and enthusiasts for Ergo and **raising a small number of funds for the platform before launch to fund development, promotion, etc.**

Guessing this was EFYT that was sold on the dex after it had gained some value? Did you write this @Justin1000 ?


[12/14/2022 5:22 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yeah, that was only post I ever made. Think at time just trying to add diversity to blog and no one ever reviewed it (there were like 10 ppl paying attention to Ergo on the planet at time!). Thought your answer was good already. Don‚Äôt think any basis for that comment on sales‚Ä¶suppose possible something minimal could have been done via dex‚Ä¶Catena managed the EFYT airdrop back then I think. Should edit it the post now? Or leave it? I am okay with either. Think post is good except for that. EFYT liquidity was always tiny‚Ä¶still waiting for Coingecko to fix the charts.


[12/14/2022 5:25 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeh think it's fine just making sure I wasn't missing something


[12/15/2022 6:56 AM] Justin1000#9555
Put the investor targeting data back in the sheet and updated (if anyone reaches out to potential targets pls update). Meeting PWC in January. Got communication with Big Brain (solid VC) and have briefed them on everything via telegram. Leave it to you guys but might consider making a new channel called ‚ÄúInvestor Relations‚Äù and can move all this there. 

But conscious maybe too many channels being created for Foundation. Maybe could consider combining Financial Planning/Fund Board/Treasury into one channel called Treasury and Finances or something.


[12/15/2022 7:05 AM] Justin1000#9555
If make the Investor Relations channel, I suggest calling it "Ecosystem IR"


[12/15/2022 9:39 AM] glasgowm#9381
Better using a post in #operational-ef I think, other channels can be collapsed into there too


[12/15/2022 1:25 PM] Justin1000#9555
Anything is fine with me as long as people pay attention. I believe this to be a very important initiative over next 6 months. And likely to need support from others including @kushti  if get to more advanced stage with any key guys.

I hope Marty plays ball else going to make things hard. He has been very positive on it but need to see him deliver.  

After a certain period I don't think we will need to focus too much on this (hopefully). Probably ecosystem handle it itself mostly and we will get everything in place. But initial reach out I think requires our best efforts.

[12/15/2022 2:01 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah I think keeping it minimal is the best bet so you dont have to guess which channel it's in. Can use tags in there & search. 

All EF members should have pings enabled for this section though. We could create a seperate EF server if that's easier to manage in terms of notifications for people?


[12/15/2022 2:03 PM] glasgowm#9381
Deliver what? Being responsive to the investors? If so I imagine he'd be fairly enthusiastic/engaged throughout.


[12/15/2022 6:35 PM] Justin1000#9555
No‚Ä¶not that simple. Marty might see VCs as competition. I just found out today my friend Thomas who helped put together the SPF seed round reached out to him in April-May and he sounded very positive but didn‚Äôt do anything in the end. This is his call and his business so won‚Äôt push him too hard.

But I hope he can find a way to incorporate VCs into the process into some high quality projects and then they will do more on Ergo later.

The VCs won‚Äôt want to see 2nd rate projects though. Waste of their time. So got to see if Marty can show them some good stuff but protect EPAD interests at same time. I think in-principal in the bear market he is willing to work with them but I would guess he still hesitant in general. Just speculation. Will continue to talk to him but he has to make his own decisions of course.


[12/15/2022 6:48 PM] Justin1000#9555
If we see quality projects we can also consider introducing them directly to VCs if we establish good relationships with those VCs. We should do what we can to make sure projects that want to build on Ergo get funding.


[12/16/2022 10:26 AM] Justin1000#9555
But for now will just plan to leave things in Marty‚Äôs hands. I‚Äôll encourage him to think of a long run strategy with VCs and maybe do short deck introing Ergopad and some of the higher quality projects in the pipeline if only on a no-names basis. Hopefully, he‚Äôll be enthusiastic but can‚Äôt say. Will just see how it goes. Myabe if VCs will get interested enough they will find ways to source their own deals for the ecosystem.


[12/17/2022 9:51 AM] glasgowm#9381
Still waiting for a response here @kushti you need to take this seriously. No point in the EF if you're just going to ignore it.

Addressing concerns I'm always onboard for. Need to provide context, nuance, etc though. There are some random influencers and other people in that chat and bad sentiment is deadly in this space.


[12/19/2022 12:05 AM] CW#8500
Talking to qx(), these recent criticisms stemmed from an extremely limited number of people in a sigmanauts call wanting the EF to subsidize project marketing and individual community member involvement which then spilled over to the Ergonauts channel. 

Providing clarification and assurance on EF processes (in Ergonauts channel) regarding EF voting members voting on funding proposals/spending, auditing/accounting, workflow tracking/accountability has put a lot of that to bed. There are a number of checks and balances in place and teams are managed. 

Reiterating the purpose of the EF, as I have always understood it (and summarized in the Transparency doc), stay neutral, build open source frameworks, raise awareness of the propocol/features and what not plus sharing my short experience as part of the EF has further provided that clarification.

Sigmanauts is a community run org, parallel entity to the EF and still has a way to go finding their structures and hierarchies within the group (roles, subcommittees etc.). It has been strongly publicized first and foremost, participating in Sigmanauts is a voluntary basis. In saying that they too will run into scrutiny regarding the management of their treasury in time once they have secured some sort of funding (who is incentivized, how much are they incentivized, quantifying work relative to other work flows etc.) I've been conversing in ways to help mitigate/manage that. I've also expressed it's very important as more members join and vote in Sigmanauts that funding isn't drawn into constant bureaucracy and infighting scrounging for money.

I'm happy to join Sigmanaut calls week to week (albeit 2am) I was frequently hosting and attending but withdrew after joining EF as to not influence direction or discussion making as Sigs is for/by the community. 

In saying that, having someone there from EF (if welcome), especially a couple of weeks ago, we would have been able to addressed the concerns raised above there and then.

As I mentioned in Ergonauts channel, providing clarity on how my team is managed. We do it through Notion and TG - Ergo core marketing (Mark and Armeanio also there from EF), editorial and events TG channels. 

Notion is being built up from scratch to include all marketing resources, guidelines and assets as many things are/have been run through many individual google drives/docs/sheets and are all over the place. 
https://www.notion.so/Marketing-19593835df2049a68a86acbaf1e78aa0

Anyone from EF is welcome to join, check progress, provide feedback and suggestions at anytime. We obviously have to be respectful of sensitive information for example listings/announcements/partnerships just to name a few which is why these groups are private to preserve relationship and reputation integrity (no front running of information/announcements etc)

As we are discussing how to get funds into Ergo ecosystem, I think, a possible solution is to offer a pack with different products of different risk profile but where contracts or prototypes are done and/or developers have proven record. For example, SigmaFinance UI + initial liquidity, Dexy UI + initial liquidity, Rosen, Lithos(SNISPs pool), decentralized grids. So pretty much like a ready fund with pretty low risk profile. Profit could be from tokens  or liquidity provided.

Yeah, I think this is good idea. There are challenges to investing in ERG from bigger guys including low liquidity, lack of typical VC deals and heavy reliance on Marty for flow of deals. To extent can show some sophisticated investors how they can get ‚Äúyield‚Äù from their ERG, would be worthwhile. This also seemed to be a key theme in Authur‚Äôs latest blog post PEMDAS: ‚Äú‚Ä¶start down the path towards finding the right asset to both participate in the upside and earn income while you wait for the return of the bull market, pull up a site like Token Terminal and look at which protocols generate actual revenue‚Ä¶‚Äù

There has been a lot of rumors in the Chinese social media/news that Huobi is having problems. Eva has been sending me info on it past day or two. Pionex (whoever that is) is reported to have withdrawn their funds. A list is circulating showing a whole bunch of cost cutting steps and layoff etc Huobi is taking to get profitable. 

Now some of the doubts is coming into the English social media.

https://twitter.com/ParrotCapital/status/1611147267775561729

Personally, I am always doubtful about such rumors. It seems they are constant about various exchanges, especially in bad market conditions. Pretty dumb of Justin Sun to buy it and blow it up months later. Probably more likely they are doing a ton of tough measures to keep costs under control and turn things around. Then people are using this as basis to spread rumors about their ongoing operation capability. 

BUT there is a more talk this time than usual. So if there is funds we can take out without impact market making, I would recommend doing so. If Huobi does go down, I think a much bigger loss than our funds will be our current most liquid exchange so hopefully nothing to these rumors.

Eva also tends to agree with my above view on all this for what its worth (although she also has no way of knowing).

[01/06/2023 1:45 PM] morphic#4133
I think it is quite unfortunate that with all our emphasis on decentralization, self-custody, and DeFi on Ergo, yet we still depend on exchanges.
Many use exchanges just to buy/sell ergo in exchange BTC/USDT/USDC/ADA.
With Rosen we have bridge with ADA, but what about BTC/USDT?
Can the Rosen tech be reused to create other bridges?


[01/06/2023 2:35 PM] Justin1000#9555
Just no way around need for CEXes for market access for now although I think gradually people will move toward dexes and things like Spectrum. Rosen has tremendous potential but probably the liquidity won't come overnight  except hopefully with exception of Cardano given the big community overlap and ease of marketing to Cardano community. 

Then I think can target bitcoin. Try to make Ergo a platform to use Bitcoin on and compete with Blockstack and ETH. Blockstack has a really powerful natural bridge with sBTC (BTC on block stack) coming. It has an on-chain oracle, one that should actually work given the Bitcoin to Stacks mining mechanism and STX are locked on-chain for mining (form of PoS mining but where you get BTC as mining reward) which effectively serve as collateral for the BTC locked in the BTC threshold signature wallet. So in terms of wrapping BTC, this should have advantage over even Rosen. But huge disadvantage is Blockstack‚Äôs inherent flaws like account model, non-turing completeness, lack of privacy functionality and I think its going to be under threat of censorship in general. Can make much better use of your Bitcoin if get them on Ergo assuming people finally start using all the Ergo apps like mixer.

And can target ETH and ETH tokens like USDT. 

Initially not sure should target anything else. Ergo still too small apparently looking at market cap so should focus on biggest most liquid chains outside of Cardano.

Yeah. For Huobi, wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about it. We can‚Äôt spend too much of our time guessing which exchange will go down next and which rumors are true. But if have excess funds there and easy to move off, might as well do so.


[01/06/2023 2:56 PM] morphic#4133
I think should bridge with BTC preferably and then ETH. 
BTC's Lightning getting adoption boost it seems. 
So that anyone with BTC assets can use them in DeFi on Ergo (as an alternative to ETH)
This is big and clear value proposition


[01/06/2023 3:22 PM] Justin1000#9555
That was my initial thinking too. If assume a near-perfect bridge, then Ergo can become a service center for BTC and basically give it all the functionality it is missing. That is what Blockstack is trying to do but I think while blockstack will have an exceptional bridge, it will lack the functionality and censorship resistance of Ergo. Maybe advantage to also focusing on ETH though is 1) getting ERG into the ETH dexes finally; 2) getting USDT on Ergo (I am assuming this can't be done from Bitcoin Omni via Rosen but I wouldn't know).

@mhs_sam, is it possible to reuse Rosen tech to bridge BTC?


[01/07/2023 7:09 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti If there is any way for you to prioritize Dexy-Gold over some other things to get it out earlier, I would recommend doing so. I continue to think there is higher than normal chance of a big gold rally (not prediciting it! Just higher chance!) and if it does happen, would be a shame to not have Dexy-Gold out before then. Dexy-Gold surging totally independent of the equity, bond and crypto markets could be a constant generator of good marketing news for Ergo. I realize its not simple and making it work properly is most important and there may be nothing you can do to move things faster but just want to point this out for your consideration.


[01/08/2023 5:16 AM] mhs_sam#1471

@glasgowm  I sent pushy follow-up email to Coingecko to finally get them to fix the chart and start it on July 1, 2019 and they asked me to send an email from an official Ergo email account to prove I am part of team. Therefore, I forwarded the email to team@ergoplatform.org.

You have access to the email account right? Can you respond to my forward sending the email to hello@coingecko.com and cc me (justinsimpson@protonmail.com). I suppose you could just say:

Hi Coingecko Team,
This is to confirm Justin Simpson is indeed a member of the Foundation and the pricing data before July 1, 2019 is not the ERG token but EFYT and is misleading and should be removed.
Thank you for your assistance!

Think quite important actually - when new people see the chart, they will think Ergo has been around a lot longer than it has implying it has made poor progress. Anyway, its just extremely misleading and at some point we got to get it fixed at CMC too but I am not going to try that for now.

@mhs_sam Yasha says technically still possible for now to distribute some tokens on Cardano side but it will be locked tomorrow and then not possible. Moreover they don't want to do it unless critical as they already assumed and made public the 3% of tokens to EF would be on the Ergo chain.

Definitely valid concern of price gap especially in early months but not clear to me how will play out actually especially in slightly longer term despite the Aneta example. There will be >4x token supply on Cardano.

40k ERGs to Treasury Wallet for Liquidation PENDING PRICE TARGETS [EF/Treasury Control]
Morphic suggested 1) chance of price spike (not clear but agree is possible) 2) we should liquidate some ERGs if happens and be ready in advance (agree). 
Therefore, I propose: 

Transfer of 40,000 ERGs to the Treasury Wallet held by Stacey.
Liquidation of 30,000 ERGs to USDT ONLY if ERG price goes >$3.00.
Liquidation of all 40,000 ERGs to USDT ONLY if ERG price goes >$4.00.


Process for Liquidat...

Not much from my side, was just going to pop by for a catchup if someone else wants to host - will be active more in coming days. We do have a proposal in from Godwoken to build a L2 EVM but figured probably not a priority atm. (Assuming it‚Äôs a grant request). I figure with such a thing you just end up inheriting a lot of problems from eth/account-model but probably has benefits I‚Äôm not considering (easier USDT/USDC integration maybe?).

Will ask them for more details and point to raffle - or put it up for a vote if they have a proposal to send us.

@DiarioBitcoin @brian_armstrong Ethereum staking is problematic. Temporarily giving up your assets to someone else to have them get a return looks a lot like regulated products. Slashing and bonds not so good. Non-custodial liquid staking on the other hand is like the mining pools we've used for 13 years

Hopefully another incentive for IOG to move quicker on Ergo. Should start building an alternative asap. Besides just having alternative in worst case, it also may give leverage in the whole regulatory game.

@kushti Yasha asked me if EF will provide liquidity for Dexy-Gold. And if yes, they would provide SPF YF incentive for this pool. I‚Äôm not sure your plans on how to bootstrap liquidity for Dexy-Gold. Maybe have a think and we can talk about it on the next call. We will have to get back to them so they can sort out their plans. I told Yasha I wasn‚Äôt sure but the idea of SPF YF incentive at the beginning to bootstrap liquidity sounded like a good idea to me.

FYI: Going to Dubai on Mar 6-13. Going to take a look at the Crypto Expo conference for one thing but generally just want to have first look now that can finally travel.
**Company**: If we want, then can look at finalizing Company details. Could do research before I go, make checklist of things to find out, coordinate with Anastasia, meet key 3rd parties while in Dubai etc. As usual, everything would be shared here and then we could decide what is best. But not going to start on that unless we think this is right course of action - Can discuss on next EF call what ppl think.


[02/12/2023 11:20 PM] kushti#0978
Big guys in the field are usually more corrupt and so "compliant", so I think we need to highlight privacy features, not to hide them cowardly right now, then there will be less incentives to "comply" in future

I think it would be good to have a mini-summit on privacy in 2023 also, a lot of interesting developments since the privacy hackathon


[02/13/2023 8:21 AM] glasgowm#9381
Sentence doesn't really make sense, but a big difference between privacy being possible and mixing actively promoted by the main entity behind the platform. The latter is likely to get us quickly blacklisted by centralised entities like banking especially if we're small and easily dismissed.


[02/13/2023 8:49 AM] glasgowm#9381
Whether we should be promoting dApps *at* *all* is debatable, we've already run into issues with anetaBTC. 

I've got this in the transparency report
> The marketing department highlights projects building in the ecosystem. However, these initiatives do not constitute an endorsement from the Ergo Foundation. The Foundation will always use best practices to vet projects and ensure that there is no risk for potential users. Still, in the early stages of development, it is often unknowable if anything of substance will ultimately be produced.

But ultimately how it's perceived by users is most important. ETH/TC works as they're seen as independent, ErgoMixer is seen as a 'product' of Ergo so we need to change that perception. Already had a handful of people from places like South Korea jump into the chats to tell us how daft it was to mention it on our site and said they were exiting erg due to it.


[02/13/2023 9:11 AM] mhs_sam#1471
Kushti is right and it really makes sense actually.
I'm in the middle of this debate however, I think we should let people know about privacy features and zk capabilities and we should not bind ANY dapp/project to EF at the same time.

It doesn't matter if it's a wallet/Raffle/Rosen/DEX/dexy/Age/ergopad/ergowell/any dapp or its a privacy enhancing dapp like mixer. 

ErgoMixer is a piece of art actually but EF should not promote it, EF should just promote Ergo's functionalities which resulted in creating such dapp as mixer.


[02/13/2023 9:36 AM] glasgowm#9381
That is also my view, scrub ergomixer not privacy features. Big guys set the standards so we don't want to deviate far beyond ETHs definition and give anyone an excuse to axe us. Don't think we have the luxury of being early enough to set it ourselves when places we're applying to are cracking down today.


[02/13/2023 10:09 AM] kushti#0978
But then we scrub all the other wallets and apps from the website ?


[02/13/2023 10:11 AM] kushti#0978
Checked bitcoin.org, it promotes privacy-friendly wallets (with inbuilt mixing) among with others


[02/13/2023 10:12 AM] glasgowm#9381
Ideally we wouldn't need to promote anything but just ones that constitute a risk imo are most important. Whether anetaBTC via investment or stuff like 'introducing ergomixer' which has led to the conflation from user base


[02/13/2023 10:13 AM] kushti#0978
Removing mixer just also will split the community


[02/13/2023 10:13 AM] glasgowm#9381
I doubt they'd notice tbh. On the apps page its probably fine. The issue is historic blog posts


[02/13/2023 10:14 AM] kushti#0978
There is no value in editing old posts, they are archived anyway and editing posts is highly controversial as well


[02/13/2023 10:18 AM] glasgowm#9381
The value is they'd vanish from the first results of google for 'ergomixer' and people would be pointed to the Git instead. Being written content it ties us it to more closesly and don't see how the blog post itself brings much value anyway

[02/13/2023 10:21 AM] kushti#0978
I guess we need to add proper attribution there just


[02/13/2023 10:24 AM] kushti#0978
If someone is thinking ErgoMixer was developed (or development was supported) by EF, that's history rewriting which does not seem respectful to authors of mixers (there were few iterations by different anons), so we need to fight with that, not with providing information about working applications on top of the Ergo blockchain


[02/13/2023 10:30 AM] kushti#0978
Or we are going to remove posts about all the apps ?


[02/13/2023 11:04 AM] glasgowm#9381
The issue is a subset of people do believe that, and it's a much more complex problem to solve than it first appears. That blog post has been problematic, not hugely but a few people over the past few years. So removing it was my way of combating that conflation as the blog is very public-facing, and people mix it up with 'official Ergo writings'. 

Just trying to be proactive as legislation is encroaching us. These next few years as critical as we need to figure out how to get mainstream use without centralised entities/govts realising they should absolutely be terrified of Ergo.

Open to other options here though; improving attribution, blocking crawlers? changing title? Opening up the blog to the community to post what they want under their own handles and making it a 'Community blog'?


[02/13/2023 11:08 AM] glasgowm#9381
Should be considered on a case-by-case basis depending on the risks/liability to the EF until we have a more established framework IMO. I can start drafting something with the sigmanauts.


[02/13/2023 11:39 AM] kushti#0978
The blog is already has contributors not associated with EF, e.g. Robert Wolf (https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_07_24_ergo_address/). https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-05-12-ergomixer/ is done by Curia Regis Crypto , I do not see any link to EF there


[02/13/2023 11:44 AM] kushti#0978
Sadly, attribution is missed there, as well as a link to the mixer


[02/13/2023 2:51 PM] glasgowm#9381
Who is Robert Wolf? was he rewarded by the EF? Curia is also Armeanio. What about changing it to 'Ergo Community' with a click-through going to a page saying how stories can be submitted by the community and are moderated by the Sigmanauts? Aswell as adding proper attribution and disclaimers/clarifications?


[02/13/2023 3:31 PM] kushti#0978
Robert Wolf is some guy from Deutsch community, he was not rewarded, Joe joined EF later? And also was not paid by ef for the post


[02/13/2023 10:11 PM] mhs_sam#1471
editing the history is not good. We can add some sentence at the end of blog post which clarifies if it's the EF opinion or community opinion.

[02/14/2023 1:24 AM] Justin1000#9555
Not sure. Could be a lot of factors at play plus the KYC cutting off at least half the planet. Plus I thought they will have YF supplemented with SPF on day 1 (not sure about this at all!) so incentive to sell maybe not high even if price up. We won't have long for first indicator tho as starts trading tomorrow. But first indicator isn't going to tell us much as will be illiquid with very limited supply. Probably going to have to wait longer, probably well into March and see how their ISPO and cardano development is going for some real indications. I am guessing we have to wait till March-April to have enough info to start basing budget decisions on the SPF price.


[02/14/2023 10:32 AM] Justin1000#9555
Didn‚Äôt expect much before the call but just had a great call with these guys! I met their rep before in HK. Basically like the Bahamas bank we were going to open an account with in early 2022 but 5-10x better. 
-Swiss-based
-Got Cardano custody and staking (so our problem of holding ADA under certain circumstances would be solved)
-No minimum bank limit
-Guy (Amir Hussein based in Switzerland) took a look at Ergo and likes it a lot
-Co. has clear development plan and seem to have full leadership backing to expand crypto business.
-**Dubai** AND Hong Kong office (have been added to the Govts Invest HK program)
-Could be long-term partner and add Ergo to trading etc when Ergo gets a bit bigger.
-One UNCERTAINTY: Didn‚Äôt get a clear answer if they would accept us if we have a Russian Director. I don‚Äôt think he knows for sure. Think we can ask the question when actually ready to open account which will be when setting up the Dubai entity. 
But also, I think we should have at least say $200-300k worth of fiat and crypto to deposit with them before opening account.
Anyway just want to put it on the radar as a potential partner to go after as soon as we are ready.

I guess Uniswap and other big dex's are our easiest route to more market access atm. Can we use Rosen in combination with the Milkomeda sidechain to get to Eth/Uniswap @mhs_sam ? ERG->RsERG->MilkRsErg?


[02/19/2023 5:00 PM] Justin1000#9555
BinanceUS is ranked #7 on Coingecko. Moreover, it would give US market access which could be huge (tons of ERG people in US and largest number of nodes there amongst other things). So we can do further research when we actually have terms from BinanceUS to consider but definitely not something we should be declining lighlty. Exchanges are all problematic. I preferred Kraken but weren‚Äôt they just attacked by govt too? And I presume they aren‚Äôt an option for Ergo as @Armeanio hasn't mentioned an offer from them? Ergo‚Äôs 24h trading volume is $300k. I consider us lucky to have an offer from BinanceUS. So anyway, not saying we definitely have to list at binanceUS but should be carefully considered once we got terms unless we have some better option that I don't know about.

Imagine very challenging to build any liquidity and interest on eth dexes for now. Doubt anyone there cares about Ergo. Probably the way is CEXes + cross chain with Cardano for now then go for them later once ergo is no longer ranked 280. But I am  not expert on this aspect for sure.

I spoke to Kras from duckpools about possibly making a donation or quack tokens to the EF as we talked about in our EF meetings. 

As suspected, due to having released their tokenomics and IDO underway they would now need to hold a community vote for this to occur.


[02/19/2023 10:14 PM] mhs_sam#1471
Not sure about how Milkomeda works, but probably yes if they can wrap ADA tokens. RsERG will be a cardano native token, however I'm not sure about the listing principles of them.


[02/19/2023 11:21 PM] kushti#0978
New listing will not boost liquidity automatically, as Ergo traders are already trading somewhere.  Thus I would like to propose to work on improving liquidity on current exchanges and get more free or cheap listings.


[02/20/2023 1:39 AM] Justin1000#9555
Well just my perspective below:
*New Liquidity: BinanceUS MIGHT be different and create liquidity. Americans don‚Äôt like giving their KYC info to Chinese exchanges like coinex. I have anecodatally heard of some buying really small amounts or not at all because of this. But with a US exchange with US bank transfers (assuming stay working) could be totally different story. Big Cardano community also in US with first access to US exchange. BinanceUS not the ideal one but maybe worth it. We want to bring in ppl not currently trading ERG, not the ERG traders which obviously don‚Äôt have money or it wouldn‚Äôt be rated #280. 
*Small Exchanges/Increasing liquidity: We talked about this months ago on the call. I thought it sounded like a good idea only as a means to end - boost volume so we can get on real exchanges like okex but I didn‚Äôt see anything happen after call. Doubt you have time for this with so much going on development-wise.  Also, basically same strategy we used from mid-2019 to mid-2020 that was mostly a failure except for Hotbit and maybe 1 other but back then it was the ONLY strategy we had to follow as no one else would list ERG. Those small exchanges disappear and have fake volume and their marketing campaigns attract no one.
*Building Liquidity: So for BinanceUS, to me it comes down to terms. Also, would be good to have a a marketing plan. Cardano is big in US and IOG is there. And we should do some basic research. If it is obvious they are about to be shut down (seems highly doubtful), well obviously we shouldn‚Äôt list there. But exchanges always have a lot of rumors and risk so we should have high risk tolerance in listings.


[02/20/2023 1:39 AM] Justin1000#9555
*Need VCs: Think we need VCs in the ecosystem. Right now only venue for funding is Ergopad. They don‚Äôt get enough funds and they don‚Äôt learn how to market. Projects attract users to L1s according to Big Brain. If VCs start funding $500k+ seed rounds and teach the projects how to market then we got NEW capital coming into Ergo ecosystem. As it is, projects raise limited funds on Ergopad in ERG from existing community and then is dumped to pay expenses and its not enough for marketing anyway.

#Ergo and #Cardano users... look at it again. Ergo only has access to roughly 3-10% of the cryptocurrency market (10 is being generous af). Rosen Bridge will be the opening of the flood gates.

[02/20/2023 1:41 AM] Justin1000#9555
he says 3 - 10% market access for Ergo with 10% being insanely generous. I totally agree. its probably like 3% for Ergo when account for not being on dexes.


[02/20/2023 4:06 AM] Justin1000#9555
Lot of overlap with gate,kucoin,huobi,coinex. BinanceUS would be purely additive as targeting US market. Obviously best thing would just list on binance given market share but guess still not option.


[02/20/2023 5:23 AM] Justin1000#9555
2 more points to keep in mind:
***Coin Storage:** Not many Americans comfortable keeping coins stored on a Chinese exchange on the other side of the planet! And many ppl still store at least part of coins on exchanges (most?). BinanaceUS has FDIC for up to $250k per this dated article!!! ‚Äì that is  huge for US-based ppl: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2019/10/binance-us-adds-fdic-insurance-on-usd-deposits/

Binance.US Adds FDIC Insurance on USD Deposits
Binance.US, the North American division of leading crypto exchange Binance, has announced FDIC insurance coverage for USD deposits on the exchange of up to $250,000.

[02/20/2023 5:25 AM] Justin1000#9555
***Legitimization**: Maybe more true before some of the negative recent news on US exchanges but this sets precedent for US listing and everyone knows that legal opinions and requirements needed for that.


[02/20/2023 5:27 AM] Justin1000#9555
So in summary: I think we should review latest news before making a decision but keep in mind the potential huge benefits of BinanceUS, our lack of other choices and the fact exchanges everywhere always have risks and problems. I feel there is some crackdown going on in US to make up for their oversight on FTX but am doubtful myself will go so far.


[02/20/2023 3:42 PM] kushti#0978
@Justin1000 I believe you know Gleb from waves? He is now Binance VP of Asia and mostly in Dubai, maybe you can meet him in the town?


[02/20/2023 4:34 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah absolutely lets see what Armeanio can get them down too, but from initial chats seems it'll be unaffordable and too much of the Treasury to risk without a decent rise in price first, or whale's paying for it. 

Not sure how much value smaller exchanges can bring vs spending it on development tbh. For Uniswap we'd just need to LP I guess, and has 1B in volume.


[02/20/2023 4:44 PM] Justin1000#9555
Yes...saw before he is VP of Asia and Dubai based. Would be great to meet him while there...

"The goodwhale" said that Binance US is a poor exchange with no liquidity in orderbooks during volatile days, no launchpad, no community etc


[02/21/2023 6:30 AM] Justin1000#9555
What about prospects with binance itself? Even if had to pay a LOT might be worth it given our neverending pain with exchanges and their huge market share. Would be good to meet Gleb. We would need all our community stats on hand and some reasons why they should list Ergo despite the low trading volume. We should modify the deck and customize for them if meeting actually can happen. Maybe can use quotes from deck what CZ actually said about listing on binance and how ergo meets criteria.


[02/21/2023 6:55 AM] Justin1000#9555
Should try and finalize a meeting time and then we can make pitch deck. Any ideas of anyone that we can offer binance in terms of cooperation that might benefit them should also be considered.


[02/21/2023 6:55 AM] Justin1000#9555

@kushti Dmitry M. Set up a call with me. I didn't know what it was about. But he went on and on about like 55k efyt he got. I implied maybe someday could be exchanged but present budget realities don't allow for it and would depend on EF as a whole anyway. Now he is messaging me again about doing something like eip27 to increase rewards to Foundation so has more funds for redemption. Guess I will ignore him.


[02/21/2023 9:58 AM] glasgowm#9381
Chancer. These are EFYT collected from Waves users right? Not an individual payment made to Dmitry?


[02/21/2023 10:47 AM] kushti#0978
Yes, he bought EFYT from Waves team.


[02/21/2023 10:49 AM] kushti#0978
@glasgowm have you seen a notice on EFYT swaps ends on July 1st 2021 ? Found only telegram references to this event.


[02/21/2023 11:00 AM] kushti#0978
Binance.com is totally different story, but it seems the offer is about US only, so looks like money grab


[02/21/2023 11:02 AM] glasgowm#9381
Could only see the one on Telegram, no reference to it on the blog. 

But it was an airdrop for users, one entity consolidating (and then selling them) is very against the spirit of the process whether we've explcitly stated so or not so I'd just tell him they're not reclaimable due to that and if he has a problem with that he should take it up with the community.


[02/21/2023 11:07 AM] kushti#0978
There's also issue with Waves team selling EFYT here I think

[02/22/2023 7:41 AM] mhs_sam#1471
I would like to raise my concerns about SigmaUSD protocol here. I'm thinking that one of the main reasons of Ergo's huge decline is this protocol. However it is a great protocol, it has very drastic economic effects on the price of the underlying asset.
As we have seen in the past, it is almost risk-free and profitable for a whale to mint SigUSD at a local top and dump the rest of his Erg in the market. 

The best strategy for him would be keeping the ratio above 100% at any time, while dumping and redeeming the SigUSD for more Erg to dump again. And this process can be continued for a while. Yes, he will probably pump the Erg again to reiterate the process but declines would be much deeper and stronger. 

Actually, we've provided one of the safest and most profitable shorting tools to the market which unfortunately is bound to Erg as an underlying asset.

What do you think about it? If you see my concerns as valid, can we do sth in this regard?

I think adding some long enough cooling time period in order for SigUSD to be redeemable can make this strategy less effective. However this has lots of technical complexities since the SigUSD will not be simply a stable coin anymore and would be more like a long term debt note probably with different valuation in the market. This makes it direct usage in the defi apps more complicated. 

Another way to look at this change is to have this time period between minting request and minting. For example, if I request SigUSD minting, my SigUSDs will be available for transfer after say 3 months.

[02/22/2023 11:57 AM] morphic#4133
I think that if there are technical shortcomings in the protocol, they must be addressed ASAP. SigmaUSD is a core feature (at least it is what advertised) so that any negative news will have huge overhang on the ERG price. The perception  "Ergo is not much different from LUNA, USDN, etc., it gonna fail eventually" is something we should avoid as the highest priority.


[02/22/2023 11:59 AM] morphic#4133
I suggest to declare a moratorium on the _new cool features possible on Ergo_ and focus on fixing/improving existing and eliminating technical debt.


[02/22/2023 12:02 PM] morphic#4133
I would instead encourage focusing of scaling of what we already have. Finishing what is not finished and adding more integrations.


[02/22/2023 12:05 PM] glasgowm#9381
The main shortcoming is that RSV isn't profitable in a sustained downtrend. Attacks with market manipulation are pretty difficult to pull off in practice so no huge risk IMO unless a much luckier trader starts trying. If price recovers problem might fix itself also. 

Few people pushing for improvement proposals, could be doing with more discussions on implementation strategy on that Git and #sips. But who could lead? SigmaUSD doesn't really have ownership so hard to get anything done.


[02/22/2023 12:22 PM] morphic#4133
We have a community culture in which creation of new things is highly welcomed and celebrated. This is good, as long as there is a back-office of devs doing mundane boring maintenance work. 
To solve the ownership problem EF should shop supporting (both financially and with publicity) projects/initiatives for which there is no clear long-term maintenance.
We should explicitly request and encourage people to start thinking long-term. Prototype is easy, long-term sustainability is hard.


[02/22/2023 12:23 PM] morphic#4133
Every student can create a "wow" prototype, get publicity and disappear.


[02/22/2023 12:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
We dropped anetaBTC pretty quickly once concerns were raised, but SigmaUSD is a bit of a special case as it was launched without governance and ideally governance is removed again once it's been improved a bit.  So there should be no long-term maintenance. 

I agree it's a corner-stone of the ecosystem and EF should direct efforts to help the community to improve it; but needs some Rust/ErgoScript devs to step up.


[02/22/2023 12:39 PM] morphic#4133
Yes, agree, but we should really do efforts in focusing on maintenance, as well as identifying and  paying technical debt. By default, without efforts, there is a natural tendency to do prototypes, publish ideas, propose new things because it is 1) easier 2) give quick publicity.

We can either invent our own approach to managing both creativity and long-term support, or better yet we can learn the best practices


[02/22/2023 7:24 PM] Justin1000#9555
I don't understand. Sigmausd seems like the least of ergos problems. It maintained the peg 1 to 1 the entire time! It has hardly been used. Ergo is a tiny self contained ecosystem. Moreover another model is coming in dexygold. Obviously if that works  better a dexyusd will replace sigmausd.


[02/22/2023 7:25 PM] Justin1000#9555
Real problems are lack of big leaders in Ergo, lack of VC funding and lack of market access #1. Ergo has like 3% market access


[02/22/2023 7:26 PM] Justin1000#9555
@kushti suggest you push gleb for a formal meeting at binance office where we can pitch why Ergo should be listed there. I can be there in person.  Good to start a formal conversation.


[02/22/2023 10:52 PM] morphic#4133
We don't have maintenance problem (at least now) for some parts (Ergo node is taken care by kushti, Sigma by me, Appkit and mobile wallet by Benjamin, JS sdk and wallet by anon-br, sigma-rust by greenhat). 
But when it comes to applications, people come and go. 
Who implemented SigmaUSD, and where he is now?


[02/23/2023 12:27 PM] glasgowm#9381
Rob K / anon_real


[02/23/2023 12:30 PM] morphic#4133
anon_real is still doing something, but is not very active now. 
However, I remember some updates about AH, but not about SigmaUSD. 
Maybe there is a perception that everything is ok and there is nothing to be done?


[02/23/2023 12:31 PM] morphic#4133
Then this may be just communication problem, when developers just don't know about the existing/potential problems.


[02/23/2023 12:32 PM] glasgowm#9381
He's not really interested in improving or using sigusd fees for bounties whenever I've spoke to him.


[02/24/2023 6:19 AM] Justin1000#9555
Sorry if came across as rude or whatever earlier in regards to SigmaUSD question, but in my view I don‚Äôt consider this a serious issue right now compared to other matters:
**-Lack of Use: **There isn‚Äôt much activity in terms of value traded in the Ergo ecosystem so not much use and liquidity for it. I was looking forward to Nightowl and other apps boosting demand/usage. Hasn‚Äôt happened yet. I think lack of real use and liquidity probably make it more vulnerable to manipulation and lead to more unpredictable returns with it but is not an issue right now for ecosystem as whole.
**-DexyUSD**: DexyGold is coming out. If it works and gets real popularity. Then I would think a DexyUSD naturally appears and can replace SimgaUSD worst case. Although maybe both competing/coexisting is possible. 
**-Minimal Impact from Whale Manipulation:** Haven‚Äôt looked at this scientifically but, while not good, I doubt the whale manipulation is having much impact. Except for once in Jan, I didn‚Äôt even see it happen lately but could have easily missed it. 
**-Simple Analysis: **For what it is worth, back in Jan, I saw it looked whale was trying manipulation again and got really concerned. Did a simple model to check if SigUSD was behaving roughly normal. Seems to me it has. See below. Obviously numbers not too consistent but except for one period, it offered leveraged returns vs ERG and I was pleasantly surprised by this overall given how little usage it has. I would hope things get better once it starts getting used.

[02/24/2023 6:21 AM] Justin1000#9555
So all these things make me not worry about this too much. But definitely no harm in trying to improve SigmaUSD if you see ways can be done now. I think our real problems now are the below and are all heavily interrelated:
**1. Market Access:** Ergo has like ~3-5% market access compared to top 10 coins.
**2. Lack of Big Leaders**: Guys like Charles (just one example) and other big names not yet taking active leading roles in Ergo. People follow big names. Just the way it is. 
**3. VCs**: Need them for 1) new capital into ecosystem; 2) teaching projects how to attract users and market; 3) provide funds for marketing; 4) Act as Leaders as in #2 - people will follow them; 5) Relationships.


[02/24/2023 2:23 PM] kushti#0978
Do you have his contacts ?


[02/24/2023 2:25 PM] kushti#0978
I agree, but that makes sense only where maintenance is needed. SigUSD at this point can be run without any maintenance, as there are multiple UIs for it


[02/24/2023 2:26 PM] kushti#0978
And that is how DeFi protocols should work I guess, nothing can guarantee long-term maintenance in this environment.


[02/24/2023 2:34 PM] kushti#0978
So I do not see any maintenance issue with SigUSD. Maybe it has design issues, but so far talks about it going to nowhere.


[02/24/2023 2:36 PM] kushti#0978
"Djed design was done by Bruno (IOG back then, now Djed Alliance), EF/Emurgo were in discussions also, there were alternative designs proposed (e.g. by Robert). Bruno also did some modeling code in Scala. Some IOG folks ("dkaidalov" and his team) contributed with simulations, formulas for minting and redemption etc. This early work is not visible to public, but some traces you can find in a private "stablecoin-project" repository.

Then Robert from Emurgo made specs, contract along with Amitabh (Amitabh made most of ErgoScript afaik), backend part. Amitabh did update functionality also .

UI was done by anon-real (Emurgo though about selling usds via Auction House initially heh). Deployment code and instructions were done by Amitabh. Deployment was done by DarkSide under my supervision. I had minor contributions and managed a lot of things around all that story.  
 
Also, Emurgo work was funded by EF grant."


[02/24/2023 2:42 PM] morphic#4133
Good team work, btw. But, now most of the team is not active.


[02/24/2023 2:50 PM] morphic#4133
I really don't know how to solve the problem of good projects done by great people and then abandoned by most of them to the point that those who keep maintaining now have N+1 projects to maintain.


[02/24/2023 3:16 PM] Justin1000#9555

@Justin1000 can we proceed with SPF token or anything else is needed?


[02/28/2023 10:48 PM] morphic#4133
one question about minotaur. Does it have a safety check of the token balance? Ergo's core protocol doesn't enforce the balance, so any number of tokens can be accidentally burnt if the wallet doesn't have sanity check, creates the transaction and forgets to return tokens in the change.


[03/01/2023 4:27 AM] Justin1000#9555
We can proceeds when your fine with the wallet. Sure they will just give us the tokens basically right away.

Originally, I was excited about making an announcement around it as it would alleviate concerns around EF funding. Now I am guessing no one will care as sentiment and price is so bad on Ergo. 

Anyway, some sort of announcement should still be made. Can attribute a market value to the 30mm SPF tokens using the DEX price but should qualify that as it is very illiquid and personally I think not sustainable with current Ergo sentiment unless they are successful with the Cardano ISPO etc. 

I am also slightly concerned some idiots who hold EFYT may read the announcement and suddenly think the EF is rich and should exchange EFYT.


[03/01/2023 4:47 AM] Justin1000#9555
Probably stating obvious but getting the tokens right now makes no difference to immediate budget situation as they are too illiquid and we have no idea yet what liquid price they will settle at. I would estimate May or even June before can begin liquidations - I think can basically follow that liquidation proposal with some minor adjustments I plan to make. Maybe some really minimal use of the tokens before then is possible.


[03/01/2023 10:56 AM] mhs_sam#1471
It uses sigma-rust 0.21 in which unintended token burning is being prevented. Anyway, the wallet checks if the sums are equal and shows burning warnings (for example if there is a unknown bug in sigmarust)
So, It will also show warnings for intentional token burning.


[03/01/2023 3:24 PM] glasgowm#9381

talked with greenhat, he created an issue some time ago, https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/issues/187
Unfortunately, the implementation requires some refactoring on Ergo side in order to make nipopow implementation available in Appkit.
I think such refactoring will be quite significant, so likely only kushti can do it. (asked greenhat what he thinks about it anyway)


[03/02/2023 11:16 AM] morphic#4133

[03/02/2023 11:20 AM] morphic#4133
However, we already have NiPoPoW implementation in Rust. Why not reuse it from Nautilus, same way as sigma-rust is now used?


[03/02/2023 11:30 AM] glasgowm#9381
wdym? Nautilus will implement it I imagine, but nobody really waiting for a light spv web wallet.


[03/02/2023 11:34 AM] morphic#4133
Nautilus can verify for each transaction that it is included in the blockchain using NiPoPoW proofs and show the special checkmark. I thought you meant this feature as well.


[03/02/2023 3:11 PM] anon_br#2282
Yeah, that's something I need to add to Nautilus, but first I will implement the transaction history tab which will be a pretty big change due to local UTxO handling.

Hey mate. I have no issue providing login details for any of the accounts. 2fa is setup so need to organise a time we are both online to provide the code 

The account that was associated with ergoplatformorg is now in the hands of the Sigmanauts.

The account that now holds the handle ergoplatformorg has 0 followers and is redirecting people to Ergo_Platform. It could become confusing running the two in parallel. 

An option could be to 
1. make Ergo_Platform comms for the foundation. 

2. Request the account back from sigmanauts and reinstate the ergoplatformorg handle. I don't think this is a good idea as they're starting to find their feet.

Or 3. Build ergoplatformorg account up from 0 again.

[03/03/2023 11:28 PM] CW#8500
In handing that account to Sigmanauts, the ergoplatformorg handle needed to be assigned to a new account.


[03/04/2023 12:28 AM] CW#8500
I should have worded this better, the sigmanauts handle was assigned to that account and they have access to it via TweetDeck. The EF still has custody of the account

@kushti Chain Cash came second (300 erg) in the ergohack community vote. Before I announce how would you like to proceed?

Here are couple of options for consideration  
- accept the prize as it was voted by the community 
- abstain from receiving award (3rd becomes 2nd etc)
- donate award 
- something else

**Hong Kong Digital Currency Academy** - https://hkdca.com/. Website unimpressive but have been running into their people a lot past couple months and they seem to building out and selecting curriculum. Also had booth at Alibaba event. Have pitched Ergo to them despite its market cap it does things differently and will be value add to their students. I will do call with their CEO and marketing manager next week. I just mention here because do we have anything on the curriculum being done for the Thai university? I already forwarded to them the DECO and other stuff I know of.

That is fine. Have pinged Dan on TG. If don't hear anything fine too...can feel them out first and  at least explain clearly why Ergo should be part of their curriculum. Will see if they are for real or a joke or want money.


[03/27/2023 3:54 AM] Justin1000#9555
**Regarding EF Call**: Things I wanted to discuss next call below. More info in notion week of mar 21.
**-Update on investor situation**. Have a lot of contacts now but nothing I can do with no deals and poor Ergo sentiment no help either. Suggested next steps: 1) Show deals to VCs when we have them; 2) Identify quality projects and make pipeline of potential deals that we can share with VCs; 3) Guide such projects to the VC route - Ergopad has 3 projects going to IDO reportedly - should any of these be approaching VCs first the EPAD after VC seed?
**-Rosen**: Update on tokenomics? Do we have a way to balance interests for VCs/Guards to make a deal VCs may go for? 
**-Gate.io** ‚Äì Should we pitch them to be Rosen Guard? Hit it off with Richard from Gate.io VC arm at event (but now I can‚Äôt find his card! Trying linkedin‚Ä¶). Could pitch both VC and Guard to them I would think.
**-Events Update**: Brief update on events I have attended and three more will attend in near-future. 
**-Pitching of projects** to move to Ergo or build on Ergo as well. Pitched 5 I met. Seems like should be new area to pay attention to given Ergo will be cross chain soon via Rosen.
**-Update on China: **1) Eva helping Spectrum; 2) Eva idea to do Ergo Chinese ecosystem website; 3) China/HK crypto booming big time.
**OPTIONAL to discuss now but am getting more excited about possibilities of leveraging Dexy in multiple ways so nice to discuss soon**: Marketing ideas around DexyGold, ideas on next versions of Dexy to maximize marketing appeal, pitching 3rd parties to make their own versions of Dexy or similar DeFi products etc.
**OPTIONAL to discuss**: New Company Set-up: Detailed docs in Operational-EF Dubai. Can discuss now or table for later after everyone has had time to read the docs and understand the implications. Also, treasury is so low right now‚Ä¶
**OPTIONAL to discuss**: SPF liquidation. Think can probably table for later though as YF on SPF further delayed and don‚Äôt have tokens.

@CW @Armeanio @glasgowm by any reasonable metric marketing efforts from EF are failing I suppose. Let's discuss ASAP how to reorganize things. I think it makes sense to open marketing planning for ergonauts and so move discussions and coordinate efforts there. For exchanges, better to have a table with exchanges in progress there as well.

Seems Huobi depsoits/withdrawals back online. But we should try to boost volume ASAP above the $50k/day level at least. Last week I ran into a lady from Huobi at an event who is apparently in charge of delistings and said they would be taking a look at anything below $50k/day. If we haven't heard any warnings from them yet then great but might be good idea to pre-empt anything. Can't the market maker boost the volume there @Armeanio ? The $10mm a day from a few weeks ago crazy but as high as practical would be good and certainly better than $50k if can be done. Or any way to boost organic volume there also good. Its one of ERG's primary listings...thanks

They should know the other account also belongs to EF, otherwise looks not very good.

What does not look good ?


[04/11/2023 10:17 AM] Justin1000#9555
**__My Agenda for Call:__**
**-An Xinxin, China and Sigmanauts: **I took An Xinxin to lunch today, ex-CEO of Jinse, biggest crypto media company in China ‚Äì he is in HK for this huge web3 festival with even Chief Exec of HK and China Liasion office kicking it off. He is long-term holder of ERG and has even added to position. Wants to join Sigmanauts and has a lot of ideas about marketing in China. Said Ergo won‚Äôt succeed without China. His English not so good but said isn‚Äôt a problem as he can get someone else to help him as needed with all translation and communication. Think could be huge asset given his network and skills. From my past experience, seemed mainly pay-to-play in China but I think his ideas are for organic adoption and we have earned his trust over time. The 2021 pump started with him and Jinse. Lastly I would point out all our main exchanges are Chinese exchanges and since no US listing seems forthcoming need more focus on China, especially with billions coming even from Chinese SOEs! Success could hinge on what he can bring to the table. Next step: Get him more info on Sigmanauts so he can confirm his interest and plan then hopefully get him started asap if its okay with everyone.
 **-Spectrum:** They seem frozen due to mainly concerns over regulation and challenges developing on Cardano and are asking their investors what to do. I told them to get on with it and probably they should launch ISPO and Cardano DEX ASAP and stop trying to anticipate every regulation that might happen anywhere in the world. Eva and I were also working on joint China marketing with Spectrum but that has also been frozen. I feel valuable time is being wasted here with also implications to EF budget.


[04/11/2023 10:17 AM] Justin1000#9555
**-Company Set-up in Dubai: **See operational EF for details. Seems can set up minimalist entity now if desired. Need 2-3 shareholders + Director/Manager. I can be shareholder if desired. Not sure who Director to be (maybe Stacie?). But up for debate if we should do this right away with low price.
**-VCs: **Nothing to do here until we have deals to show. Any available or ones we should identify early as potentials from recent hackathon? If don‚Äôt identify early and float idea to them, then may lose chance‚Ä¶besides good team and idea, token needs to have clear use case and economics. One thing I will be on the look out is some funds that can buy in the secondary since we still don't have any deals.
**-Rosen Guards: **Hope that is going well. Might consider asking An Xinxin his thoughts on it in relation to China and if it might make sense to approach any good Chinese firms/exchanges for it. 
**-Dexy Strategy:** Not urgent but curious about long-term strategy here and rough expected all-in costs per annum for users? It costs a lot to buy, store and insure physical gold. Is the product feasible for Oil, S&P etc? If so, could have Companies or financial firms develop and market Dexy products in future. If DexyOil feasible, maybe would make good marketing tool for places like Saudi Arabia. Probably should market Ergo in Riyadh under right conditions. Possibility of a DexyOil product along with developing DeFi tools like options/futures might make a good backdrop for that.


[04/11/2023 10:19 AM] Justin1000#9555
Think he means "unknown wallet" sounds bad. An uninformed person could think the funds maybe are being misappropriated. So for EF, maybe good to identify other EF wallets where larger size internal transfers might occur.


[04/11/2023 10:24 AM] glasgowm#9381
Eva is also in it now so maybe she can help him. I imagine he'll be admitted to a SigCan no problem - application form on the bottom of this page

[04/12/2023 4:52 AM] Justin1000#9555
@kushtiSpectrum wrote a long doc and asked their investors on April 7th what to do and I immediately responded but none of the investors have responded yet. Sent you my general advice to them in Telegram. Maybe this is something you don't want to get involved in but if you feel like you could make an impact you might consider discussing with them. Personally keen to see their ISPO get started so liquidity can start building and we can start using these tokens to alleviate EF budget issue gradually. I find it odd if they are trying to comply with some possible future regulations other projects doing ISPOs etc don't seem to be worried about. They are still awaiting some response from investors and are revising doc into one page summary to prompt investors to give some feedback.


[04/14/2023 11:06 AM] kushti#0978
where is the doc? cant find the chat


[04/14/2023 11:30 AM] kushti#0978
@Armeanio are you still checking the mailbox ?


[04/14/2023 9:19 PM] Justin1000#9555
https://sigmausd.io/#/ -> oraclesseems slow to update the price. at $1.87 but price ~$1.90-2.00 for hours. I can't recall how long it is supposed to take but FYI


[04/17/2023 3:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
Didn't notice it but it's at the minimum threshold for oracles (needs 4 Active) so if one drops off for a bit it can freeze. kushti is adding qx() and we have someone else who's keen to run one too so hopefully should help reduce the downtime.


[04/17/2023 3:01 PM] glasgowm#9381
Sorted and labelled all the emails back to 2021. Following up with any loose ends or anything we missed.


[04/17/2023 3:03 PM] glasgowm#9381
Also think we should make a pitch deck for exchanges. Can be used for both new listings and existing ones. Cover why it's in their interest to list and promote us.

Hi guys sorry, it's 420am and just jumped up out of bed thinking of the meeting. I woke up laying on my phone so don't know if I snoozed or flat out turned it off with the meeting was about to happen. 

A bit of background. Of late I've been back on the tools doing a lot of manual labour converting one of my warehouses for a tenant that has signed a significant lease. Makes joining meeting in the middle of the night a bit tough from a fatigue pov


[04/20/2023 5:34 AM] Justin1000#9555
@Armeanio how senior leon? He seems worthless. Sent you a telegram with some thoughts.


[04/20/2023 7:30 AM] Justin1000#9555
@glasgowm should try to get An Xinxin to highest level possible on sigmanauts in as short as time possible.


[04/20/2023 7:30 AM] Justin1000#9555
He needs something semi official to go full speed. He is already talking about doing developer event in bj. I can happily attend in person

Need to move fast on china. Last week was defining moment. The floodgates are opening.


[04/20/2023 8:50 AM] mhs_sam#1471
what can we do? can we start something monthly or on occasion with jinse or any other good media?


[04/20/2023 9:49 AM] Justin1000#9555
We need to do whatever An Xinxin says basically.  I will do my part. I told him can't allocate too much budget right away but once we start getting some tangible results and events and connections we can ramp up support. 

Jinse not so important at moment. I think An Xinxin by himself can do a lot more than jinse given  his current level of focus.


[04/20/2023 9:49 AM] Justin1000#9555
Eva working overtime on it

Awesome! Anything I can do to help from ecosystem development side?

What do you think about adding internationalization support to Nautilus, so Eva can jump in and translate it to Chinese? I'm busy with other tasks ATM but if it is something helpful I can take some time to work on it.


[04/20/2023 4:12 PM] Justin1000#9555

On plane. Can't seem to edit doc. Probably able to attend call... From me:
*Attended Hyfi conference. Might have some media leads.

*Main thing need to sort out is a wechat public account to more effectively market now regulations more relaxed. Lots of discussions on this...

*Discussed degen marketing and miners with chinese guys from shanghai who just happened to be in Vietnam too.


Got a lot of following up to do with recent contacts over next 2 weeks.

Waiting for a new PR to be accepted with a few additions which should reduce the dip at the end here a little, but thought this was pretty impressive anyway. Price overlain with developer activity.

@glasgowm I want to start pushing things forward on China as fast as possible now that I am back focused. Bunch of outstanding items. Want to udpate our China team on status and next steps on everything. Did you hear anything about his Sigmanauts app? I saw they did call last night. Maybe I should have joined to hear what they were saying.


[04/27/2023 7:03 AM] Justin1000#9555
just discussed with Eva. she joined the call herself. said not to worry about it too much so guess no need to rush this right now. fact is most of the action still in Ergonauts as Sigmanauts still getting off the ground.


[04/27/2023 9:45 AM] glasgowm#9381
9 yes votes so far, so should pass this wknd


[04/30/2023 5:35 AM] Justin1000#9555
Maybe what is happening with SigmaFi is most exciting thing I have seen since Ergo launch. Just thinking:
*Should make sure SigmaUSD doesn‚Äôt have problems. Glasgow had mentioned some potential problems with oracles before I believe. Now could be time to resolve if there are any.
*Suppose not so much we can do to get more SigRSV minted as we can‚Äôt do financial advice but that would be nice to see as lack of SigUSD might be biggest constraint right now to growth of SigmaFi.
*Eva is going to inform China community about it in detail.
