@jasondavies @benjyz @Robert K @morphic @scalahub  So initially blockchains provided rich functionality via features built into the protocol (Nxt, BitShares), then blockchains with generic Turing-complete languages appeared (Ethereum etc). With them DeFi is about platforms which are hard-to-produce, error-prone and have centralized interface. 
However, with templatizeable contracts attached to coins directly and interacting over blockchain transactions we now have protocolized DeFi where all the participants do create contracts (usually by picking them from templates and parameterizing) and they're interacting through transactions . 

Is it a good picture? 

Then this https://www.ergoforum.org/t/universal-dapp-interface-package-standard/153 can be a game-changer

Before I head off for vacation I thought it would be worth posting this publicly on the forum for anyone who‚Äôs interested. This is a potential standard that could make sense to work towards for dApps for Ergo, so I‚Äôm open to all feedback. You can find the original doc her...

I think that's a good way to describe the whole picture.


[01/24/2020 10:13 PM] Robert K#0722
There's most definitely a lot left to be developed compared to the current model of smart contracts, and the idea I outline in that piece is likely a solid first iteration forward for generalizing dApps so that they aren't simply funneled to centralized entities.

I would prefer the IDL to be a subset of Scala


[01/26/2020 9:06 AM] scalahub#2618
Is that possible?


[01/26/2020 3:47 PM] Robert K#0722
@scalahub It's defnitely possible, it just needs to be decided on. I think for our ecosystem aiming to make the IDL work with AppKit/GraalVM is probably the most sensible approach imo.

i have a question on ergo mixing,

when i mix it asking for multiple addresses


but magnum wallet has one wallet address for ergo


[08/10/2020 5:41 PM] kushti#0978
@Kst actually, Magnum allows for multiple addresses (derived from the same secret phrase, don't forget to back it up!), use "add wallet" button to add new Ergo wallet

@kushti how long does mixing take, its been more than several hours


[08/11/2020 8:08 AM] scalahub#2618
@Kst I guess it would depend on number of rounds, size of pool and token/fee boxes. Is it stuck at one status?

currently it needs basic coding skills ... as you see in the examples, this playground environment `import org.ergoplatform.playground._` from https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-playgrounds helps you  design your dapps but then one needs to get rid of it and replace the playground "calls" with real API calls (note that I'm a newbie in this, this is how I see it now) ...

Is ERGO looking for insurance solutions similar to NexusMutual or other risk transfer mechanisms?


[05/25/2021 3:45 PM] danandbeard#3509
I'm new to smart contracts and their capabilities - is it possible to lock/unlock portions of funds inside and address "quickly"

usecase: distributed exchange, everyone sends their coins to the DEX wallet but can only unlock coins they own - no transaction fees, so similar behavior to traditional exchanges, but protected from exchange exit scams


[05/25/2021 3:47 PM] danandbeard#3509
again, extremely ignorant on the subject, but it seems like it's unlikely you could do more than lock/unlock entire addresses which to achieve the same functionality would mean a trade would have to happen in even units and the DEX wallets would have to be a crap ton of addresses that effectively get locked/unlocked a bunch of addresses to represent an entire trade


[05/28/2021 11:07 PM] kushti#0978
@danandbeard not fully understand the usecase, but funds locking is possible in Ergo, some examples are in https://ergoplatform.org/docs/AdvancedErgoScriptTutorial.pdf (reversible addresses, cold wallets)


[05/28/2021 11:19 PM] danandbeard#3509
I think what I'm envisioning seems impossible, but I'm new to smart contract


[05/28/2021 11:20 PM] danandbeard#3509
but effectively I want to take a single address that has 2 ERG and lock 1ERG such that userA can unlock it and lock the other 1ERG such that userB can unlock it


[05/28/2021 11:20 PM] danandbeard#3509
the use case is this...an exchange is simply sending all coins to a single wallet - no transactions involved...then trading happens just by sending the keys around


[05/28/2021 11:21 PM] danandbeard#3509
so off-chain trading without ever having to worry about the "exchange" having access to your crypto


[05/28/2021 11:22 PM] danandbeard#3509
my somewhat trivial knowledge of cryptography would suggest that each address has keys such that you can unlock all or nothing, though


[05/28/2021 11:23 PM] danandbeard#3509
effectively I'd like to trade crypto without incurring on-chain transaction costs


[05/28/2021 11:25 PM] danandbeard#3509
so my next iteration on this idea is to just create a bunch of wallets with small units of coins and then you trade around the keys - again this can all be p2p trading keys around (and the "centralized" authority would just be a piece of software that can verify all addresses A-Z do in fact belong to user A, at which point the software would decrypt those keys such that userA wishing to move their funds away from the "exchange" now has decrypted keys to do so)


[05/28/2021 11:27 PM] danandbeard#3509
I suspect my use-case is poorly thought out and thus hard to envision though so I'll probably just read up on the capabilities here


[05/28/2021 11:29 PM] danandbeard#3509
but the overall goal would be that you can send ERG to a collection of addresses - these addresses represent the "exchange" - the off-chain software simply keeps track of which user owns which keys and only when a user who owns the keys to a collection of addresses decides to move off the "exchange" does the software decrypt those keys for the user wishing to "withdraw" from the "exchange"


[05/28/2021 11:33 PM] danandbeard#3509

[05/31/2021 10:23 PM] kushti#0978
there are some contracts like that, even for Bitcoin, with different use cases and assumptions, e.g. coinpools https://discrete-blog.github.io/coinpool/ . Pretty promising L2 solution actually

the 'artistic statement' part of it is mainly a way of generating buzz/marketing the idea


[06/03/2021 9:49 PM] gp#6635

you could auction off tokens worth, say, 3% of your income as a doctor or a lawyer (or whatever career you were shooting for - maybe even just your net income in general) to try and pay for it


[06/03/2021 9:55 PM] gp#6635
token holders are incentivized to support the individuals they have a stake in, because the more successful they end up, the greater the value of that token


[06/03/2021 9:55 PM] gp#6635
can be thought of as decentralized private lending, or a form of 'social investing'


[06/03/2021 9:57 PM] gp#6635
lets say that doctor you helped sponsor ends up making 200k/yr; as a token holder, you get 3% of that distributed to your wallet (aka. $500/month in passive income) for as long as that doctor is making money


[06/03/2021 10:02 PM] gp#6635
in theory, the platform would enable anyone to tokenize their income, allowing us to trade 'shares' in eachother via decentralized exchanges

how do you ensure payouts from the earner? tax records are private, correct?


[06/03/2021 10:14 PM] gp#6635
yes; that's where the infrastructure may have to be built; could potentially use something like OpenLaw to create decentralized legal contracts


[06/03/2021 10:15 PM] danandbeard#3509
how do you incentivize the people to build the infrastructure?


[06/03/2021 10:16 PM] danandbeard#3509
the person being educated has a strong disincentive to lie about their income so presumably you'd need a stronger incentive for people part of that transaction to disclose, and even then seems like laws would probably go against leaking income information


[06/03/2021 10:16 PM] gp#6635
that's a good question lmao


[06/03/2021 10:17 PM] gp#6635
in keeping with the idea of 'people becoming corporations', it may have to be that token holders are entitled to that information


[06/03/2021 10:21 PM] gp#6635
In the US, Federal and state laws grant shareholders the right to sufficient information about the corporation they've invested in to be able to make informed decisions re: the company/voting/etc, which would probably mean tax records in this case, but there are a whole bunch of limitations to inspection rights


[06/03/2021 10:23 PM] gp#6635
in any case, first step might be wrangling some grad students to hash out the legality of this


[06/03/2021 10:23 PM] danandbeard#3509
so the person, before becoming educated has to become a publicly traded company with the SEC?


[06/03/2021 10:24 PM] danandbeard#3509
that sounds more expensive than an education :p


[06/03/2021 10:24 PM] danandbeard#3509

crowdfunding education does sound really cool though

maybe instead of education you fund apprenticeship where the person is on contract to work for a company...you pay that persons wages and then after the apprenticeship that company is part of the contract to release their salary info?


[06/03/2021 10:29 PM] danandbeard#3509
that situation incentivizes everyone involved I think?


[06/03/2021 10:31 PM] danandbeard#3509
still some gaps to fill there, of course, but seems closer to plausible imo


[06/03/2021 10:31 PM] gp#6635
yeah i follow you there


[06/03/2021 10:35 PM] gp#6635
my only gripe is that it moves away from the educational aspect then; e.g. law firms will often 'court' law students from specific institutions for a year or two and then hire them as soon as they've graduated


[06/03/2021 10:36 PM] gp#6635
the barrier to entry in such cases can be the tuition cost of the more well-regarded universities


[06/03/2021 10:38 PM] gp#6635
banks will happily give you a juicy loan if you're accepted to harvard or wherever - but they'll also want you to hand over all your financial information, not to mention the predatory arrangements centralized institutions are often incentivized to make


[06/03/2021 10:39 PM] gp#6635

Btw I think global mutual credit system (trustless, so collateralized) can be perfectly combined with ErgoFund, so funds collected can be used to open credit-line basically to spend money for services in the mutual credit system

I've been investigating "community lending" for a bit and the LETS/mutual credit works well but is limited in scale and is very hard to get adopted. In a sense, you would have to convince enough people to have a working mini economy

My specialty is the economics of crypto, mining and marketing. 

With the help of a developer I was able to build and still operate a 3 Gh/s mining farm. 

I can manage a crypto project but I am desperately looking for a link on the ergo side to ask questions during the process of integrating sigusd to the Point of sale app.

There's no bridges currently, SOL soon


[01/16/2022 5:59 PM] Alien Œ£ Crypto#4489
There is project that Ergo, I believe should cross partner, is called Drip Network. The farm that is launched called L1 Manor Farm and next week The Animal Farm L2.
Their L3 project cross platforms and that should probably be the partnership. I believe it's amazing advertising for Ergo to be in partnership and eventually should do a liquidity pool like ergo stable coin and Drip.


[01/16/2022 6:00 PM] Alien Œ£ Crypto#4489
Also they have a bridge coming in to Sol this year.


[01/16/2022 6:05 PM] Alien Œ£ Crypto#4489
We are like #2 project on BSC and top 10 among entire difi community. I say we are is due to the fact that I'm on Drip Network and Farm and part of the community, however I'm not affiliated directly with dev team. I will have a very tiny part of ownership in the Animal Farm like everyone who is holding/staking Farm tokens.


[01/16/2022 6:05 PM] Alien Œ£ Crypto#4489
Anyways I'm mining ergo since may and I love the ergo tech it self.


[01/16/2022 6:08 PM] Alien Œ£ Crypto#4489
Maybe ergo foundation should contact Drip Network devs and arrange something  for L3 face in the Animal Farm
