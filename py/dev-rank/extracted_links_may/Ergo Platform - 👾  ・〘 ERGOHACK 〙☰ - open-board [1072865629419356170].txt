The team is just me currently, I want to build this project as a learning experience and the ergohack provided me with the opportunity. The high level building blocks planned are:
- function to put up a new pin on-chain. Remains to be seen if it will be in NFT standard format or simply registers attached to boxes
- editing an existing pin's text on-chain. Basically just changing the content register's text.
- fetch all on-chain pins to the local client
Front end:
- simple buttons to create and edit pins
- display fetched pins

Once this basic skeleton is set up, the front end can be improved (hopefully a more experienced UI/UX designer can help). Example features:
- block pin/author address
- Save pin as favourite, would easily see future edits by the author
- export/import local block/favourite lists

So life got in the way and I'll be travelling during most of the ErgoHack. I'll definitely keep working on OpenBoard, but as a regular small project and not within this Ergohack's timeline.

Enjoy your travels mate! Glad you're sticking at it as I think it could be useful tool (especially with some voting system added).
