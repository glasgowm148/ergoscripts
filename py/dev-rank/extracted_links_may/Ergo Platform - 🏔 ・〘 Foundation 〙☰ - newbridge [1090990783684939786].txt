Congrats to (supergeometry) for the launch of Ergold - Metaverse v0.1! This new version works on Android but the UI is not very touch friendly. Despite this, the potential of the Metaverse is clear and the team is receiving a lot of positive feedback. However, one unanswered question remains - could the hold-click camera be inverted? Check it out at https://www.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/comments/12wio7y/ergold_metaverse_v01/ and find out more!


ErgoClips recently released a video on quantum computing and resistance, raising interesting questions about the implications of quantum computing on current security systems. The video addressed the potential of quantum computing to break encryption, with its ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù capabilities compared to classical computing. It also discussed the potential defence against quantum computing, such as post-quantum cryptography, but the video did not go into the specifics of the technology. https://www.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/comments/12wjqrp/quantum_computing_and_resistance_ergo_clips/

Nebula866 recently posed a question on the subreddit /r/ergonauts about the best wallet to use for Ergo. They suggested Nautilus as a good option, but also mentioned Ergo Mobile and Satergo for desktop. They also mentioned Ergo mobile wallet for iOS, and that it could be used as a cold storage with an old phone without an internet connection. They also suggested Starego for a full node wallet to help the network, and Nautilus or SAFEW as a hot wallet. No answers were provided to the question of using Ergo wallet on an old Android.

Questions posed include how much can a bot generate in fees, how can a bot run by a single anonymous host be trusted, and what would prevent someone from running a bot to redirect funds to their own wallet. It has been clarified that revenue is dependent on volume, and that the worst malicious bots could do is choose the order in which transactions are processed, with all transitions checked on-chain by validation scripts.

**Found this somewhat old video where Dan talks about T1 listings, for those of you who keep on asking why not yet.**
- Fussednot has posted an old video of Dan talking about Tier 1 listings for Ergo. People have expressed frustration with exchanges charging high fees for listing the coin. It is pointed out that Satoshi did not pay any exchange to list Bitcoin. Despite the different circumstances, it is acknowledged that a comparison between Ergo and Bitcoin can be made. The crypto market is 1/10th the size of gold, and Dan noted in an interview that internet adoption took many years. Ergo will need to gain access and adoption through grassroots efforts, and will become easier to buy if motivated.

**What would Satoshi have thought of Ergo? by (fussednot)** /r/ergonauts/comments/12t9dxa/what_would_satoshi_have_thought_of_ergo/

Summary: Satoshi Nakamoto would view ERGO positively, appreciating its decentralized nature, financial contracts, privacy, openness, and longevity. He believes that ERGO and Bitcoin can coexist and serve different segments of the market, and that continued development and adoption of both platforms will contribute to the growth and maturation of the blockchain space.

@openai_bot what are ergo data inputs?


[05/01/2023 11:41 AM] openai_bot#6772
Ergo Data Inputs are a unique concept created by Ergo blockchain. Essentially, Ergo Data Inputs allow multiple transactions to share a data-input box, storing only a single reference to the box in the block. The benefit of this is that it reduces the size of the blockchain, allowing more transactions to be processed faster and more efficiently. Ergo's implementation of Data Inputs was later added to Cardano after the Vasil hardfork. You can read more about Ergo Data Inputs and their benefits in the Ergo documentation: https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/tree/master/docs/AdvancedFeatures/DataInputs

Ergo Data inputs are a unique feature created by Ergo which allow transactions to share a data-input box, storing only a single reference to the box in the block. This feature was added to Cardano with the *Vasil* Hardfork.

Data inputs can be used to store various types of data that might be relevant to the transaction. For example, a data input can be used to store information about an asset that a transaction is exchanging. The use of data inputs can reduce transaction size and fees, improve privacy, and enable new types of smart contracts.

To learn more about Ergo Data inputs, you can check out the Ergo documentation on GitHub:

@openai_bot Why does Ergo use 'Coll' instead of Array?


[05/01/2023 1:13 PM] openai_bot#6772
There are a few reasons why Ergo uses 'Coll' instead of 'Array'. First, 'Coll' is defined in ErgoTree's 'Contextful' class as a context-dependent collection type. It is designed to handle collections in various contexts, including those that are subject to large constraints, where 'Array' may be less efficient. Another reason for using 'Coll' is to remind developers that it is different internally from Scala's Array, as mentioned in a message from scalahub#2618 on 06/08/2021 at 5:59 PM. However, 'Coll[Byte]' is still ordered and functions similarly to Scala's Array[Byte] . If you would like to dig further, here is the link to the GitHub file containing ErgoTree's 'Contextful' class, where 'Coll' is defined: https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/blob/master/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/ergo/Contextful.scala

@openai_bot write an ergoscript contract that locks erg in a box and is only unlocked with a certain NFT


[05/01/2023 2:22 PM] openai_bot#6772
Here's an example ErgoScript contract that locks erg in a box and can only be unlocked by spending a specific NFT:

```
{
  val requiredAmount = 1000000 // 1 million erg
  val nftId = base64"your_nft_id_here".toColl

  OUTPUTS.size == 1 && // Only one output box
  OUTPUTS(0).value == requiredAmount && // The output box contains the required amount of ergs
  OUTPUTS(0).tokens.nonEmpty && // The output box contains at least one token
  OUTPUTS(0).tokens(0)._1 == nftId && // The output box contains the required NFT
  INPUTS.size == 1 && // Only one input box
  INPUTS(0).tokens.nonEmpty && // The input box contains at least one token
  INPUTS(0).tokens(0)._1 == nftId // The input box contains the required NFT
}
```

In this script, we first define the `requiredAmount` of Erg that needs to be locked in the output box, and the `nftId` of the required NFT token.

The script then specifies the conditions for spending the output box. Specifically, it requires that there is only one output box, that the output box contains the required amount of Erg, that the output box contains at least one token, that the first token in the output box is the required NFT, that there is only one input box, and that the input box contains at least one token and the first token is the required NFT.

This script will lock the specified Erg in a box and only allow it to be spent if the input box includes a specified NFT.

Please note that this is just one example of how to write an ErgoScript contract that locks Erg in a box. Depending on your specific use case, you may need to modify or customize the script.
