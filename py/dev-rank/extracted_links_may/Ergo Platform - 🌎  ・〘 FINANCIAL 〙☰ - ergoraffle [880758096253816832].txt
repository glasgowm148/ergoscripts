- Works great, does seem a bit slow to return tokens (15-30m) so maybe an indicator for the user here to wait
- % funded on homepage (and probably sorted by % funded to stop spam)


[08/31/2021 8:30 PM] mhs_sam#1471
Plz plz plz note that this is a beta. It works and already tested for days. But, it is beta. We would like to give it a chance in wild to figure out any bugs and issues.
Based on the findings there would be some changes in the dapp, including the contracts.

So, making a raffle with a 1 year deadline or donating to it is not a good choice.

@mhs_sam I could support with UI/UX design, but not with UI dev. So would still need a frontend dev. But let me know if I could be of any help.


[09/01/2021 12:30 PM] Legendonger#0662
Heya @mhs_sam 

I'm a professional web dev from New Zealand specializing in React. I've been looking for an opportunity to contribute to the Ergo ecosystem, and would definitely be keen to help with your UI. 

Message me if you'd like to chat :)


[09/01/2021 3:43 PM] Snipe#9798
I‚Äôm a backend / mobile developer but also have some experience with react and would love to help!


[09/01/2021 7:03 PM] retpumpz#6845
Hey, thanks for the invite. Quick intro : I raffled my house in 2017, sold 500,000 tickets for ¬£2 each, raised ¬£1 million, gave 40k to charity, hit the global news - skynews live worldwide, BBC etc I sort of found a loophole that stopped the gambling commission from shutting down your raffle here in the UK. This caused an avalanche of copcat raffles. I'm super interested in helping with the legal setup with ergo, also in extending raffles in perpetual raffles for ico style share and profits issuance, high frequency micro raffles etc what would be the best way to present my ideas to you guys? Also, I would be happy to answer any questions. To check out my raffle just Google "Melling Manor" cheers!

[09/02/2021 12:54 PM] pbr713#9954
@mhs_sam is it possible to put a creator section in the raffle? I all for supporting the driving forces of ergo but I also want to ensure legitimacy. Just a thought


[09/02/2021 1:00 PM] Snipe#9798

[09/02/2021 1:02 PM] mhs_sam#1471
Sure sure


[09/02/2021 1:17 PM] mhs_sam#1471
I like the idea but I will not do it. I think some community dev may create a raffle to raise fund and develop it. I will donate for sure to a legitimate dev with plan.


[09/02/2021 1:19 PM] pbr713#9954
@mhs_sam right on. Even if you just put the field in and not make it mandatory.


[09/02/2021 1:27 PM] mhs_sam#1471
Currently the raffle service fee is 5%, I'm thinking about decreasing to 1-2 percent in one year or so.
interestingly, this 5% or so, can be divided manually or even in the contracts.
so, I would be happy to see a very rich website with lots of features on top of the raffle. This way we can negotiate the developer fee for that website.
so, one can raise the dev costs by a raffle, and/or earn a portion of the fee for UI.


[09/02/2021 1:32 PM] retpumpz#6845
@mhs_sam cheers. I'm writing some notes that I have been working on to send over to you. Hopefully my experience can be of help here, it's great to see huge progress and interest so far. Ps I had intended to use www.synthesis.finance as a platform and there are some basic ideas sketched out over there. I would be happy to share/donate that domain/logo etc for a platform if anyone is interested

Take a look at dlapiper for legal ideas globally for raffles - see prize draw law. For reference you won't be able to do much with the existing system as it will need some additional functions, so in this case you would need to manually process elements of the raffle which would quickly make it complex. I'm hoping to help out on ideas for this soon but automating the legal side could be very complex.

[09/08/2021 9:23 PM] retpumpz#6845
Hey, sorry I haven't had time to note anything down as yet due to other commitments. I just wanted to say that obviously raffles on ergo would likely fly under the radar for a long time legally, however, perhaps the easiest way to legalise them with the most jurisdictions being applicable would be to add a simple skill based question requirement for entries. This could be a multiple choice question which should require a degree of judgement to answer. Beyond this free entries would be the other route but this would require more trickery - normally in a real world raffle you could allow entrants to enter for free by post with a paid stamp on it - a similar solution via  Blockchain message or transaction may be possible as long as the fees don't profit the person running the raffle and the free entry doesn't cost more than a paid entry - there are a few more requirements (please see dla Piper above). A mix of the two is also viable. Perhaps a postcard as a service/nft mashup on ergo would work for a free entry route! I think once this is solved then raffles can be massively modified for ico style perpetual raffles and also automated hi frequency mini raffles for such things as babbel fees and stable coins.  Back to free entries, obviously the transaction cost can be used to throttle the amount of free entries, but at the same time they should be no less convenient to use, it's an interesting problem to solve if keeping everything with the Blockchain eco system.


[09/08/2021 9:29 PM] retpumpz#6845
To quickly explain the ico/raffle idea - switch an individual prize to an ongoing prize, switch single use tickets to multi use tickets, switch from single large prizes to multiple smaller prizes. Use proceeds of ticket sales to invest in assets eg real estate / defi / other - pay profit out monthly as prizes to ticket holders.


[09/08/2021 10:36 PM] mhs_sam#1471
thanks for explanation! It takes some time to grasp it!
I took some notes and will research on the topics.


[09/09/2021 10:49 AM] nitram147#5106
For some raffle participants it could be beneficial to collect SigmaUSD instead of ERG (for example the dogfor the autism boy, dog has fixed price in the USD) üôÇ


[09/09/2021 10:50 AM] nitram147#5106
If I rember correctly how the raffle backend work, it should be easy to made this modification (participant should of course send also some nanoergs for future transaction fees)

I exchanged 110.5 Erg‚Äôs that were crowd sourced by using beta.ergo.raffle.

100.5 were raised through the raffle and 10 were donated by twitter user @ClayrgoNauts

Thank you to everyone who contributed.

The exchange was to USDT and after fee‚Äôs the amount is $1937.27

I then sent it to my coinbase account for a fee of 22 USDT = $1915.21 sent

Sold the USDT for $$s for a fee of $28.40 = $1877.81

Sent funds to my bank account with no fee.

$575.00 loaned on Kiva 9-16-21

Please feel free to advise me on what loans on Kiva I should put the rest of the funds towards, I will listen. üòä

I have a question about creating a raffle, sorry if it's a dumb question. I'm confused about the difference between the "charity wallet" and the "wallet" sections of the form. Is "charity wallet" where I want the money to go and "wallet" my wallet to pay the fee? Thnx and really cool project btw.


[09/17/2021 2:06 PM] zargarzadehmoein#2928

There are some raffles that are doubled, including one I made. It happened because I thought something went wrong after I paid the fee, so I tried again but not realizing it takes time. Would be good if there was a way to prevent this kind of thing from happening by accident lol.

i think it would be good to have some sortings (eg. trending, new, close to deadline etc), maybe even have some categories somehow since there are too many raffles going on and you currently need to go through all of them afaik

the current raffle dapp is working only with blockchain's data and there is actually no database on the backend. So, some features like tags and categories are not straightforward. It is possible but data needs to be stored onchain, increasing the tx size and fee. For now, we chose to avoid this.

Also, data is partially fetched from the explorer when you scroll the site. I mean we do not fetch all the raffles at once. So, sorting a partial data while scrolling provides new unsorted data is absurd. But, we are working on it to provide some levels of sorting.

I'm working to outsource building and managing of a subsidiary raffle site with all the centralized amusements, like user profiles, comments, fund tracking and reporting, vids,...
this website uses raffle apis and will act as a centralized bulletin board for raffle information, while raffle dapp is fully decentralized. Later, we can choose if the current raffle UI is still needed or not (it can be used as a raffle explorer though)

if raffle is successful, the total raised funds will be distributed as: charity%+prize%+fee%=100%. 
if a raffle is not successful, nothing is charged and the funds will be refunded. of course, there are mining fees to be paid for each tx.
there are no hidden fees.

currently the fee is 5% but it is configurable and I think we can decrease it over time.


[09/24/2021 1:20 PM] vegycslol#1714

i know as i have read on the previous messages this is a very simple first ui version, but would like to know if is in the plans having an ui to see all the transactions and tickets owners distribution and, after raffle is done see wich ticket and wallet have won. i think it would be great because it would give all the information about the raffle "statistics" to all the people making things fair for all (just my thoug). excuse my grammar english isnt my language.

@Dmitry Usov could you use an Oracle? Something like: CharityX could make a unique NFT and then publish the ID at a well known URI (ie, `charityx.org/ergo-identifier.txt`). Then an Oracle pool confirms the ID <==> `charityx.org` link).  Then you make sure the charity address of the raffle has the NFT?

Hey guys, when trying to create a raffle, I have an issue pasting my wallet address. I cannot even type in anything,  tried firefox and chrome...


[11/14/2021 12:57 AM] nitram147#5106
What it should be useful for?


[11/14/2021 12:57 AM] nitram147#5106
There's much more simple way for verification


[11/14/2021 12:58 AM] nitram147#5106
Each raffle attendee should decide whether the raffle is legit or not by his own reasoning.


[11/14/2021 12:59 AM] nitram147#5106
If the charity raffle want to make it more trustworthy it could do the following:


[11/14/2021 12:59 AM] nitram147#5106
1.) Post charity website into raffle description, ideally pointing into some article charity . xyz / article . php ? id = 123


[11/14/2021 1:00 AM] nitram147#5106
2.) Post raffle id (obtained from ergoraffle site), into this article


[11/14/2021 1:02 AM] nitram147#5106
User can now verify that when he opens website mentioned in raffle description he can see the same raffle id as the page on ergoraffle which has pointed him to the website. From this information he could be sure that the raffle owner had access to the charity website in the past (of course it could be also a bad hacker...). User have then to verify that this charity belongs to legit organization.


[11/14/2021 1:04 AM] nitram147#5106
This way is much more user friendly for the raffle creator and it doesn't require anything specific. Thanks to this vague specification it can be used even when for example user (charity employee) don't have access to create a file, but have access to make new article.


[11/14/2021 1:05 AM] nitram147#5106
Using oracle pool for such a things would be overkill and it would not introduce any advantages over the approach I mentioned here.

i dont understand the question


[12/03/2021 5:04 PM] mix#6733
All you have to do is buy at least one ticket to this lottery and wait, as the smart contracts here will handle the rest.


[12/03/2021 5:04 PM] mix#6733
how i can win a that lottery??


[12/03/2021 5:05 PM] quokka#1273
You buy one ticket (each ticket is worth 0.5 ERG) and as soon as the deadline happens (in 15 days) then a random person with a ticket gets the winning pool. The more tickets you buy the higher chance you have. The lottery refunds everyone if the 319 ERG minimum isnt reached


[12/03/2021 5:06 PM] mix#6733
then how they get the random person??


[12/03/2021 5:08 PM] quokka#1273
They use some sort of math in the smart contracts to randomly select a winner


[12/03/2021 6:30 PM] mhs_sam#1471

@mhs_sam if you have not set the wallet address with the button in top right corner, you are not able to type anything into the wallet address. Since it asks "what is your wallet address?" it feels that it is asking me to type it in here. This seems unintuitive to me.

Is anyone familiar with personal crowdfunding laws in the US and how you'd have to report donations from a raffle? I'm just curious! I'm a broke math student currently stuck with a computer that isn't capable of running nodes. I want to participate more into this ecosystem and thought this might be a good opportunity to crowdsource for a new computer if I successfully ran a raffle with an NFT + part of the donation pool as a prize. However, I'm not exactly trying to break securities laws by just going for it without prior knowledge üòÖ

Hey there, I was trying to learn some more about RNG on Ergo. I see Ergo raffle references Oracle Box Id which I see is supplied to the contract as a dataInput. I was wondering where this ID comes from? Is it from scanning the blockchain for any oracle it can find (how do you find oracles?).

HI


[02/05/2022 3:22 PM] TheStophe#8489
Hello, with the recent events of the GoFundMe and Canadian Truckers, it made me wonder if (regardless of cause) it would be possible to have a private raffle, where the recipients paste in their address (truckers), and the people fundraising would put in erg, or maybe wrapped btc neta.  The funders would win the lottery (50% of pot), and the other 50% goes to say recipient addresses, 1 transaction to many.  This was instead of the traceability of bitcoin, it is private with erg. Perhaps on the other side, if they prefer bitcoin, it is automatically "unwrapped". Just some thoughts.


[02/05/2022 3:22 PM] TheStophe#8489

[02/13/2022 9:26 AM] mhs_sam#1471
Hi, no need for a private raffle.
However raffle only supports one winner and one charity address, It is still doable. The charity address can be any address, so one can use a P2S address which distributes the funds between several user addresses (a proxy contract). More interestingly, ergo contracts are composable. So you can send your funds directly to the ergo mixer and no one can trace the funds.
