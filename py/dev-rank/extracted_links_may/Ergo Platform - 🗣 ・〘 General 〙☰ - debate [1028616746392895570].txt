First topic: Do we need a debate channel?


[10/09/2022 11:54 AM] ziggomatic#9335
nay. back to general we go


[10/09/2022 11:54 AM] mugen_mu#1660

Waiting for who says no.


[10/09/2022 11:57 AM] no1smove#0177
My take is this. 
The whole situation lumps us in with other generic L1s and shitcoins. The three key marketing advantages Ergo has are tech, decentralisation, principles. We were rugged of our principles, and as this was a top down decision maybe we've lost our decentralisation too.
So what are we left with. Tech? Every blockchain has tech


[10/09/2022 12:00 PM] ziggomatic#9335
i don't know if we're bridged to teleshit just yet, so we're losing based and valuable and based input from the based community that side. based.


[10/09/2022 12:00 PM] no1smove#0177
I guess the manifesto says something about hype marketing and cannibalizing other projects users.
But there's always been a certain morality in ergo that literally nowhere else in the crypto space has. That's what's been violated

It's etc's account. It's their story. Let's say you create a Facebook profile for grandma cos she's shit with computers. Sure you hold the login details but it's still her profile.
You don't just go give grandma's profile to someone to go try make money from it just because you two had an argument. That's wrong


[10/09/2022 12:06 PM] glasgowm#9381
@ChuckBird I said earlier i have no moral issue with it, and I'm no moral moral relativist.

Optics was why I was originally hesitant but yeah still worthwhile imo. Response has been much less critical than I expected tbh, outside tg/discord

My thoughts exactly  - it's just bad PR. It's not worth it in my opinion. It's going to sour the relationships withing PoW community for years to come ...


[10/09/2022 12:15 PM] phyro#7120
From what I've seen, people in Ergo community have very different principles. In fact, so much different that you guys never had an actual test to see if you think alike. Now that a test came, as an outside observer, it seems quite obvious you don't think anything alike. No one is going to make people suddenly get this issue, at least not many. It's either very obvious _because_ of your principles or it's not obvious at all. At the end, each person has to decide if they can look past this issue and move on hoping it won't repeat.

[10/09/2022 12:22 PM] no1smove#0177
Yes! This is what makes Ergo special. It's not a crowd of just degens and moonboys wanting pamp. We're the kind of project that is sustainable and will continue to attract new users. It really sets us apart.
Now we've gone and done some dirty shit we risk putting off the very people who would be attracted to Ergo and stay with us. 
What we had was soooo fucking rare in this space. We can't throw that away

[10/09/2022 12:26 PM] ChuckBird#9809
Well, the question is if adherence to these values wasn't an illusion and wishful thinking in the first place. Seeing the reactions here and on Twitter, it would seem that Ergo community is just as toxic and self-absorbed as everybody else in crypto space.


[10/09/2022 12:26 PM] mugen_mu#1660
I think this is charles crusade and we have been dragged into it, for better or worse. I just hope this is the end of this kind of shock marketing and we focus on attracting real value


[10/09/2022 12:27 PM] ziggomatic#9335
it generally (ergo community) wasn't. it has taken a turn recently

It is the same, the difference is just to what extent and from where these attempts come. I guess the bad part here is that you have a central entity that's integral to the project which made this move. I will agree with Glasgow though, I did expect more people to step up and say no to this.


[10/09/2022 12:39 PM] mugen_mu#1660
On chain, you're right, nothing has changed


[10/09/2022 12:40 PM] no1smove#0177
There's been practically no talk of this outside etc and ergo communities. All it's done is alienate passionate Ergonauts. Nothing is gained, only lost

Yeah, it's all democracy and shit, let's vote on every fart, but when somebody says something we don't like, it's whiners and moralists and lets move them somewhere to the basement. Human hypocrisy ...

[10/09/2022 12:48 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I would say through all the noise that I've seen some varied responses, and that the opinion doesn't seem particularly monolithic. So it's hard to generalize the entire community to be on one side or the other.


[10/09/2022 12:49 PM] ChuckBird#9809
I'm disappointed, but not entirely surprised ... my view of humanity is to pessimistic at this stage of my life ...


[10/09/2022 12:49 PM] phyro#7120
fun fact: this does remind me of ETH and the DAO hack in 2016. You had a very small minority consisting mostly of technical people that understood what was going on. The ETC you guys hate on was that small group that said "no" to the action made by a central foundation. The project some of you were hating on was actually made from a similar group of people that had higher standards.

Anyway, this isn't like the ETH DAO hack as this was a twitter account, not anything on chain


[10/09/2022 12:59 PM] mugen_mu#1660
If they pushed therough the Hard fork without a vote, for example, that would have been like the ETH DAO hack


[10/09/2022 1:00 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Sure, but that's a problem with most democracies in general. Most voters don't participate except on a few core issues, and I would be surprised to ever see that change to be honest. I'm guessing a lot of people couldn't care less about what's going on in twitter, much less the new charles drama of the week.  Personally I don't care much about what happens to the account either, though the discussions are interesting to say the least.


[10/09/2022 1:00 PM] phyro#7120
I was comparing the fact that two groups were identified that had very different values.

[10/09/2022 1:03 PM] mugen_mu#1660

[10/09/2022 1:04 PM] ChuckBird#9809
Agreed, sadly most people don't give a s**t about anything except their paycheck and full belly ... I'm pleasantly surprised about maintained high level of support for Ukraine in the US and EU, though. We'll see how it goes after the winter ...

[10/09/2022 1:27 PM] phyro#7120
A part of the strategy is to present ETC as an immoral project. Can you imagine what would happen if people believed ETC was a project with high integrity and a history of firm ethics? It's all just damage control over a petty action which you guys saw right through it.

I know many people who struggle with their paycheck and feeding their family - and yet, they care about right and wrong, basic morality and decency. So I guess the problem lies in the lack of good education and positive role models

Yeah, some lead personalities in the space are his buddies. When he started crapping on ETC and praising ERG few weeks ago, the ERG twitter reply was pretty smitten. A sensible person would distance themselves from this ...

Once again, using Charles as marketing for Ergo is totally the wrong move. 90% of the crypto space will not touch Cardano with a ten foot pole even though its a good project

That's why I stopped following him on Twitter and Youtube. He is an excellent orator and well-read, he has kind of philosophical overreach that's rare, but he is too much of a narcissist and toxic ...

Playing devil's advocate here , you are free to have an opinion but you don't speak for all. Your comment should say : "In My Opinion"  he is too much of a narcissist and toxic ...  but you make a blanket statement & wonder why mankind is where it is.

Reputation is important to your brand/organization, and I certainly don't want to be seen as Cardano is by many investors/users in the space


[10/09/2022 2:00 PM] phyro#7120
I think this is an apples to oranges comparison. The protocol doesn't have ethics, it has consensus rules and it just validates them and keeps running. People on the other hand, have ethics and a moral compass. If you're devoting your time to a project you might want to make sure you're at least somewhat aligned with the ethics of the group.

I understand why Charles is doing it he put a bunch of money into ETC and didn‚Äôt get what he wanted and has a lot of resentment towards ETC. But that‚Äôs between Charles and ETC.
    That said there are 3 types of people camps of people in this community when it comes to this situation. 
1: people who don‚Äôt care either way and will stay here regardless.
2: people who liked the exposure of the twitter account take over and will likely stay here regardless. (Here being in the community.
3: people who have an objection to the account takeover and are considering leaving the community and in some cases maybe have already left.
     So it would seem that if established members of the community are valued the right decision would be to give up the account.
 Thoughts?

Air conditioning, groceries stores, the technologies we‚Äôre communicating on right now, automobiles, and the highest rates of class mobility as apposed to being peasant farmers or suffering mass starvation due to poor centralized planning or being thrown into a gulag forced to slave labour because there‚Äôs otherwise not much incentive to work or innovate. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs better than our alternatives so far.

I've given this cultural aspect further thought, and at the risk of reading too far into it... - Perhaps a lot of us in the english speaking world are more cognisant of the consequences of colonialism. We understand the negativity that comes when you try to erase a people's history. What I've heard from supporters of the takeover sound a lot like the British in late 1700's Australia - The Aboriginals are slow to develop, they're backwards, no one cares about them anyway. They'd be better off joining us and our way of life. To hell with the culture and history they built, we'll make more money if we just take their shit instead of leaving them alone.


[10/09/2022 3:48 PM] no1smove#0177
and now only a few days later we fastforward to the late 1900's Australia "What's done is done. Let's just not talk about it anymore. Yeah, it's sucks for them but we can't wind back the clock. Just don't talk about it"


[10/09/2022 3:57 PM] ZOo M√®o#1809
I think you overthink too far...
The fact is they built their community on sand. They didn't manage the risk. They didn't act to move their members to a safe place when they were still active. That is the root problem... now many come shit with all possible nuisance on all our community as if we were all guilty of anything and responsible of an independant structure that can make their own choice (and that is good for many aspects)... and I don't see many loud voices of their side calling to keep cool heads
Now we have eat the shit and we should clean their own they never put a single effort to manage or be the bad guys... that's kind of funny...

Just for the record. I think the twitter hijack is abhorrent. Not because I believe the owner of the account should be censored in anyway. But because the account owner disrespected the followers of the account. People are saying its all bot followers but the truth is that noone knows whether that's true or not.  It's basically spam email marketing. That's no way to build a well regarded and long-term brand. It instantly puts Ergo in the scam category for anyone less familiar with the project. That's all I'm saying on this issue.

who is the dictator ? where was the democracy about managing the twitter account securely from its inception ? Who was the real owner of the account ? who was bothering about it ? 
if you ask questions then try to watch the whole context and not just a restricted one that suits your current feelings on the moment...
there are lessons to take for everyone, and it can be done in a contructive manner even if I see mostly the other way 

Anycase I just find that's kind of nerd bad joke going into drama... we got some funny memes at least, people like memes ^^

I think I'll draw the line here as well. At this point it seems pretty clear how this will play out. Out of those against, a few will leave and a few will find an excuse justifying it's not that bad of a move and stay. To each their own. I wish you well with your project and hope you don't have to deal with such things in the future (though I'm not holding my breath). Take care and rather than breaking each other, focus on building bridges, especially with the communities that share similar ethos and hold a higher standard than an average project in the space.

Kevin Lord had TweetDeck access for these six years and did most of the work.   He never **owned** the account.   He had been shafted as much as anybody else and it is understandable he is upset.   None of that changes the facts.  That Charles transferred the primary account to Ergo.

I know the history between IOHK & ETC my point is disagreements are nothing new , however who you choose to be you mouthpiece matters.


[10/09/2022 5:10 PM] ChuckBird#9809
I absolutely agree, I don't think they realise how much this can back-fire and how much this can haunt them in the future despite a few morons saying "Who cares" ...


[10/09/2022 5:10 PM] bobsummerwill#0773
Anyway.  It has all been said many times over.  It is down to the Ergo Foundation now.  Ball is in their court.

And there is also the question of how that foundation interacts with the Ergo community as a whole.  They make decisions and it impacts you all.

Man, I don't usually insult people, but you're literally the dumbest guy in this forum. It's hilarious that someone like you who attacks anyone with different opinions with such low level of rationality and high level of emotions is hurt by my post. It's ironic that I was mainly thinking of you when I was writing it and it's usually the people to whom it applies that come first squeaking like shot pigs. Please, just ignore me - I tried to block you but for some reasons it's not possible for unverified account ...

[10/09/2022 5:26 PM] ChuckBird#9809
I never call people names, not unless attacked first. I think your problem is total lack of self-reflection that comes with certain maturity. You always see in others what you yourself do. Never accepting responsibility, always blaming others. You're either immature kid, in which case hopefully wisdom comes with age, or you're just helplessly emotionally deprived adult in which case God help you. I know you'll always reply with new sets of excuses and distorted facts, I don't think any further discussion is fruitful, so like I said, please, just ignore me.

Pumping ETC is not the goal of the IRS-registered public charity which I run.  Its goal is to support the ETC ecosystem, not to pump the price.

But I have done plenty of public speaking and AMAs.

IOHK were engaged in the ETC system from 2016-2018 and 2020-2021.   They built a Scala client called Mantis.  It never got to production status really, either time, with only 2-3 nodes on mainnet at max.   He says they spent $2M on it first time around.   Also funded a podcast called Let‚Äôs Talk ETC for a couple of years and a part-time technical writer.  Hired a community manager for a few years.  So likely a few million spent all, in all.   Which is nothing to him as a billionaire.   They ragequit twice when his suggested protocol changes were rejected by the community.

Especially in blockchain where we are trying to build better systems to take power away from rich and corrupt central parties.   If it is just the same in our own projects then what is the point?    Is the Ergo Manifesto just bullshit?  Is coin go up all that matters?

What do you think the typical response someone would have if they were Charles. Putting millions of dollars and their time and energy into something and not get what they wanted out of that? Do you think most people after that would feel entitled to the twitter account they have authentication credentials to? Would you? Was there ever talks about trying to give him his investment back to get the twitter back and just be done with him?


[10/09/2022 5:58 PM] hellyea#2223
It doesn‚Äôt, but they do anyways, it‚Äôs a fact. There is no perfect human being with full of good deeds.

I came to crypto space thinking good about people having brains to follow the ‚Äúdecentralization‚Äù but I was wrong. There will be fights like wild pigs, this man is wrong, that women is a slut of monero, this fatso is curse to blockchain, skinny stick is greedy, people suck, this that, all BS.


[10/09/2022 6:00 PM] bobsummerwill#0773
His company‚Äôs voluntary investment in the ETC ecosystem in hopes of commercial gain is completely unrelated to his custodianship of the public good which is that Twitter account.

It was not verified based on that investment.  That work was done by a community member prior to Charles taking control.

I gave up the Ethereum Classic twitter account because I did not want to devote the time and work required. If the team running it now, doesn‚Äôt believe in the project, they should give it to someone that does want to put in the work.

They were not responses.
They were statements into the ether, because I did not even know who these people were.
Mark's response was lost in a see of millions of posts on this Discord, and you would have to know who "glasgowm" is for it even to make sense.

This is not good communication from the Foundation for something which is obviously big and important and controversial.

If it was me I would have written a blog post on the ETC Cooperative website and that would have been tweeted/reposted on all public channels.

It‚Äôs understood that investments come with risks but when an investment completely fails one that millions of dollars and your time has gone into do you not understand how someone could feel entity to a twitter account they have authentication credentials to? Does collective history garnish more entitlement than millions of dollars and time for nothing? If the ETC community didn‚Äôt contemplate recouping any of Charles investment to say here‚Äôs some of that money back give us our twitter and fuck off than clearly the twitter account is worthless or at least not worth much more than text on a screen no?


[10/09/2022 6:18 PM] bobsummerwill#0773
This line of thinking negates **all of the other ETC community members** who have put in years of unpaid voluntary work to support the protocol and build on it.   It negates the work of the ETC Cooperative for 5 years as a non-profit supporting the chain.   It negates the work of ETC Labs who spent years investing into the ecosystem too.

Is all the work they did to ETC gone or just the original twitter account? Listen bob I want to be clear I don‚Äôt think ergo should have the twitter account because we didn‚Äôt earn the followers I don‚Äôt like having things I don‚Äôt feel I‚Äôve earned. That said I don‚Äôt get to decide. And Charles may not need the money but ETC doesn‚Äôt ‚ÄúNeed‚Äù the original account this isn‚Äôt about necessity it‚Äôs about who‚Äôs entitled to what and why. And As far as I‚Äôm concerned the only party clearly not entitled to that account is ergo.

Loss of historical tweets is worse than the loss of followers.
With 600K there is obviously a load of inactive followers or bots or whatever.
But there a lot of real people in there built over years.
Some maybe just passively watching, but part of the ETC community nevertheless.
If Ergo had bought some random existing Twitter account to get the follower clout, that would be bad in itself.
The fact that this is the ETC community's own account is the worst thing.
This has actively hurt us, and that was an intentional action by Charles.

It's not hard to understand.

If Ergo's twitter account (60K organic followers) was given to another project by somebody in the Ergo Foundation who left Ergo and did something else, how would you feel?    Like, say CW, who appears to be in control, gets sacked and joins another project, and has the login.

Do you have multiple sauces? Cannabis in your state is crazy expensive. I was going to buy some passing back through a year ago or so and was immediately upset lol


[10/10/2022 3:35 AM] Others#3550
yes. I currently have 4 sauces of varying flavor profiles and heat levels. I like hot but I gear more towards good flavor that the heat compliments. I will see if I can find a pic real quick of all 4. As far as cannabis goes, not only is it expensive but the tax is insane.

    What‚Äôs the original? Scotch jerk sounds good so does mango habanero. Anything hotter the habaneros hurt my stomach


[10/10/2022 3:41 AM] Others#3550
Original is a Jalapeno and Serrano sauce. Medium heat (think sriracha heat, not flavor) has some red bell pepper, onion, garlic, and sweetened with a touch of pineapple. Scotch Jerk is a Jamaican Jerk style hot sauce and Hab mango kind of speaks for itself. The Ghost is quite spicy but not like hot ones level heat. About 200k Scoville

[10/10/2022 3:46 AM] Others#3550
yah. My website is currently the best place to order. Hoping to start amazon prime shipping Q1 next year.  I started making sauces because I grew too many peppers. My first year with a garden I just wanted to make homemade salsa. Ended up with a shit ton of extras so just started experimenting. I enjoyed it so I just ran with it. Used to sell just off Facebook to family and friends. Would whip up like 12 flavors, total of about 250 bottles, and post it up. It would sell out within a day so figured I was onto something.

I agree, however to just come into the ergo channel just to stir shit up was unnecessary. He got the Twitter handle, that's what he wanted, he should've just left it at that. but no, instead he insisted to continue crying about how links are broken and history lost blah blah blah. You can't have the best of both worlds some days.

kinda was. it was a bad look when he started dishing out the eth history books as some kind of hit piece. shoulda stuck to facts, as few as there are. seems no-one can prove anything, so it is a civil matter or disagreement. still a really shitty look, not sure why ergo wanted to brand themselves with this drama

where does it store stuff in that case?


[10/10/2022 5:22 AM] Code#9289
Telegram stores data across distributed data centers which are located in multiple jurisdictions. All the data is encrypted and non of the data is together with the keys.


[10/10/2022 5:22 AM] Code#9289
So no hacker nor government is able to actually gain access to the data on the servers


[10/10/2022 5:23 AM] Code#9289
If one dc goes down, some features become unavailable for example profile pictures might load 75% in some countries.


[10/10/2022 5:24 AM] Code#9289
And at 75% the data isn't even decrypted yet so it's just corrupt data until the dc comes back up

[10/10/2022 9:10 AM] no1smove#0177
Glasgow man I'm sorry but I must be honest, I've been so disappointed in the EF lately. All those hours Ive spent watching Deco YouTube and docs, mining Ergo when I could've been making more on Eth, brainstorming to follow my dream of launching a product on Ergo. Spending money stacking ERGs. I can't help that feeling coming like maybe I've been wasting time. That's on me though - I hadn't thought about how top-down an EF judgement could be. But I really hope you guys start talking to the community properly and we get a formal response about all this. The lack of proper communication/statement imo the biggest thing polluting sentiment.
I'm desperate to move on and contribute positively to the ecosystem but I just don't have the will for it until there's resolution

[10/10/2022 9:14 AM] glasgowm#9381
Fair enough but the foundations goal is to promote ERG, and it's power in the community is diminishing through our own actions. (ie; Sigmanauts program) Hopefully they will be running socials soon. Armeanio was away at cnftcon and is drafting something when he comes back. CW has a sick wife/kid to deal with and I'm a degree seperated so can't comment fully other than my opinion and that I approved the initial change


[10/10/2022 9:18 AM] no1smove#0177
Thanks Glasgow. I've expressed my opinions more than enough now so I won't be commenting about it any further. I'll probably just use this time waiting for Armeanio's statement to go touch some grass.
Good luck

I wanted to get phyro to contribute to ergo for some time. The guy is competent, understands tech and crypto and is as honest and respectful as they come online. It's pretty damn hard to find contributors like him. This kind of demolished all my effort towards getting him.

brigading a community isn't respectful, you don't see any Ergo people over there although many agree with the decision.

i don't see how one can claim such filter makes sense. That's basically "hello, we made a controversial decision, let's ban everyone who joined lately and hope the debates about that decision would stop". To me that's not a good solution. And my honest opinion is that the whole crap, that ergo is dealing with, is a result of ergo foundation not communicating well with ergo community. The debates started since ergo got that twitter account and have been splitting the community, yet we still have no official explanation from the foundation about why that decision was made and what can we expect in the future (regarding this tweet account). I know you've given some info on the discord but i would expect an official statement on the issue and i would expect that statement to be made long time ago


[10/10/2022 9:45 AM] glasgowm#9381
Most places have anti-brigading rules it's fairly established in moderation.


[10/10/2022 10:03 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
That's the thing about a debate like this, people who are adamant that this was a bad move (like myself) aren't going to be swayed to change their minds & those who see no issue with it think we're just being annoying drama queens at the minimum, or are ETC fanboys in disguise at the maximum. Lol. 

I'm not sure there's much to discuss at this point, I just hope for the sake of our community we can learn from this. 

Although I'm  unhappy with this choice, I think blaming the decision makers is counterproductive & not the way forward .

[10/10/2022 10:13 AM] vegycslol#1714
Most moderations warn people before they receive a ban. From my debates, and i've complained quite a bit about that, i got a feeling that part of existing ergo community is making it a bigger deal than the etc newcomers. Also some existing ergo community members behaved like crap towards people who are against what you've done, yet they didn't receive any punishment. Is it because it benefits ergo? The debates won't go away now that you've banned them. We can label this any way we want but this is textbook censorship

[10/10/2022 10:26 AM] vegycslol#1714
i think it's obvious to an objective outsider the foundation made mistakes here and i believe people should point them out. The tldr i see is that people were complaining, EF refused to respond and instead decided to censor that "brigade", even if they were a magnitude more respectful than some ergo community members. There's a big difference if people brigade and act like total jackasses (which is mostly the case imo) or if they just join the community and present their view in a polite way. The main people i saw from "etc brigade" were ronin, bob and phyro all of which raised the bar on this chat regarding respectful conversation through valid arguments.


[10/10/2022 10:29 AM] glasgowm#9381
Brigading is just any form of participation, that's why it's `np` on reddit. The discord was shared on the ETC server and ~10 joined

The ones that spammed copypastas got kicked straight away. Ones that were respectful were left to voice their opinion but not indefinitely


[10/10/2022 10:30 AM] vegycslol#1714
so how is that not censorship? you're using the "brigading rule" to justify censorship


[10/10/2022 10:30 AM] ChuckBird#9809
You can rationalize it all the way you want. It just makes you look week. Strong people can take criticism. It's not like there were armies of bots, it was one or two guys.

if the communities, led by the main people in ergo, are unnecessarily censored don't you think that tells a lot about people running this project? i feel more and more that EF has a problem admitting mistakes.

[10/10/2022 10:36 AM] crozillo#0000
In the last days there is coordinated fud attack against ergo foundation i think. Ok the community has different opinions, thats Normal. But some users, maybe from etc or another ergo hater, try to raise up the emotions and try to divide the community. We must keep together.  I think ergo team, foundation and community will find the right balance.   After years of researching different cryptocurrencies there is no alternative to ergo.

People with their own biases who distort the discussion. They made their points clear I don't think giving them free reign indefinetely is productive. Community should be allowed to discuss it amongst themselves especially on a medium like Tg/Discord which is so easily distorted.


[10/10/2022 10:45 AM] vegycslol#1714
It's incredibly convenient for EF to bring the "brigading rule" and get rid of opposing voices. If you weren't a part of the EF i think you would have a different opinion. I'm very disappointed by the EF and discord actions and whoever supports such actions seems to have a skewed view on the freedom aspect most are here for. That's all I have left to say.

"People with their own biases who distort the discussion." - that sounds like One party rule. Everybody is biased in their own way, including you and me. That's part of being human.

Everyone who joined after and was active in this chat was kicked after I read through the subreddit and seen how off-base this place had gotten.

Anyway, this is ridiculous in my eyes. Justifying these actions will only make you guys appear worse and I stand by that we're reaching new lows. We should do better. These guys didn't even get a proper response from EF and we banned them. That's not how things are handled in a civil discussion

Reddit spam accounts are really annoying, and I'm the slowest reddit mod at banning them too. üòÖ 

But basically if you're just saying the same thing over and over. And you're not willing to go talk in other channels about ANYTHING  else Ergo related, then you're not  really an Ergo community member are you?

More like a therapy session for us to come do our part and share our opinion, scream at the üß± feel like we've made progress, and GTFO. 

If you're a real grassroots Ergonaut, getting banned from here would be like a badge of honor. There's a process to appeal unjust mod decisions for any unlikely victims to the ban üî®,  

You whining over and over about the atrocities you've seen, is only taking us off topic of #debate

But some users, maybe from etc or another ergo hater, try to raise up the emotions and try to divide the community. We must keep together.

Of course but equating these values at their extremes doesn't make sense as context is important. The manifesto advocates for censorship resistant tooling, but that doesn't mean we don't need a content policy or rules in community spaces.

There is a large difference in putting content rules in place in discord vs burying/banning people that think the foundation made an ethical mistake.

I understand they weren‚Äôt members of the community but I welcome the differing opinions of others when they can be disgusted in a polite manner. Which is rare enough in real life not to mention online. I understand they aren‚Äôt members of the ergo community but I‚Äôm certain they took the conversations here and showed their own communities. How do we want others to view our community. As disrespectful, trolls, and/or overly censoring or stoic, reasonable, and/or forgiving? I understand censoring blatant shilling and harassment but I think people like bob really wanted to discuss his grievances with the people in charge of making the decisions and all he got was responses from people who have no real say in the matter.


[10/10/2022 4:01 PM] K√µpuz <Live Laugh Love Die>#2200

Well, Charles claims the account was his, ETC community says it's not true, that he was just given custody and wasn't even the original founder of the Twitter account. So we have an ownership dispute here. At best they've played useful idiots to Charles, at worst they are accessories to a theft. It's like accepting money with dubious origin that were possibly stolen and then saying it's not your problem. Moral cowardice at its worst.

You can‚Äôt steal something you were given. There‚Äôs and argument to be made for who‚Äôs entitled to what for both Charles and the ETC community and that‚Äôs not our problem. And if it were that important to you were you messaging Charles about giving up the account before ergo was involved or did you not know about it before this happened? Because if you knew before Ergos involvement and did nothing about it you have no moral argument to make.

I think there‚Äôs an expectation that the EF would follow the vision of the manifesto and for one reason or another there are people who feel as though this expectation was violated.


[10/10/2022 5:51 PM] mugen_mu#1660
Maybe the manifesto was just virtue signal marketing


[10/10/2022 5:52 PM] ziggomatic#9335
that does make a lot of sense. lure in a bunch of idealists, then harvest their tears to melt the snow in winter

We've turned a youtuber with an active follower base who was largely pro ergo against us for the sake of a dead ETC account followed by mostly bots. Top tier marketing . Everything surrounding ergo now will be followed by this etc drama like a fart in a room with no ventilation. We had a strong Twitter account with 60k plus actual ergo followers. wth was the foundation thinking..

He ended on his opinion which was against the move as he believed it was ‚Äúdeceiving to potential investors‚Äù and ‚Äúthe followers weren‚Äôt based on the merits of the project‚Äù roughly quotating.


[10/10/2022 6:04 PM] ziggomatic#9335

And I think I agree with @ZOo M√®o ‚Äúthink‚Äù that the actions of the foundation are not the actions of the whole of the community. However it can be hard for people to separate the two, and the foundation is clearly directly tied to the protocol so the actions of one can affect the perception of the other.


[10/10/2022 6:07 PM] Milk-Stout337#7586
True


[10/10/2022 6:08 PM] mugen_mu#1660

I've always taken "manifestos" in crypto full of noble sounding buzz-words bullshit with a grain of salt ... It's just like politicians ... Reality is usually much more grim ... when we pull down the curtain of idealism and "making world a better place" crap and have an honest look at naked reality, people mostly care and fight only about 4 things: money, land, power and pussy ... We can rule out land and pussy here (at least I think, you never know üòÜ ), so this is mostly about money and power (to the lesser extent). They wanted Charles to use his celebrity status to continue shilling their project, so they did his bidding ...

How can things published in the whitepaper before the mainnet launch be a secret? Yes, ERGs are locked up in contracts, unlike Bitcoin and its forks which do not have expressive contracts, and so emission hardcoded in client code (which is worse for many reasons, e.g. RVN fork)

Had potential to open ETC peoples' eyes. Could have discuss why they used Charles' Twitter account as their primary, how development on ETC will end now that they can't copy and paste from ETH to fix their problems, or why the split with IOHK happened in the first place. Last one is interesting, and may apply to Ergo in the future.


[10/10/2022 10:55 PM] Milk-Stout337#7586
How has this stunt affected the growth of the community? Positive, negative, or negligible. For example has there been rising rates of new wallet addresses, has there been more developers coming to ergo, more miners, or is it too early to tell how the Twitter acquisition has affected ergo?

i've seen plenty of ergo bashing around the internet lately - twitter, reddit, discords, etc


[10/10/2022 11:55 PM] MKUltraCorp#1953
but are there ergo people out there actively bashing etc?


[10/10/2022 11:56 PM] MKUltraCorp#1953
i think staying out of the mud will be of benefit to showing the natures of either side

also my mistake, i called them ergo people instead of ergonauts üòÑ


[10/10/2022 11:59 PM] Milk-Stout337#7586
I wonder. It‚Äôs likely at least a few people were put off of ergo from this but as of now it doesn‚Äôt seem like there‚Äôs less interest in ergo if you look at wallet growth. It‚Äôs likely just people of other communities being opportunistic and bashing another ecosystem for conformation bias.


[10/11/2022 12:00 AM] MKUltraCorp#1953
i know people were put off, but the reasoning they had was we didn't take a high enough road


[10/11/2022 12:01 AM] MKUltraCorp#1953
for them to turn around and start bashing ergo wouldn't be much of a high road for them to stand on


[10/11/2022 12:01 AM] MKUltraCorp#1953
so those are the least of my concern regarding bashing


[10/11/2022 12:02 AM] MKUltraCorp#1953
that would be like saying my shit doesn't stink while taking a dump on my dinner table


[10/11/2022 12:02 AM] Milk-Stout337#7586
Very true. I still think ergo shouldn‚Äôt have the twitter it didn‚Äôt grow on principle but I don‚Äôt think I put people off who aren‚Äôt maxis of a different technology. Just speculation.


[10/11/2022 12:04 AM] MKUltraCorp#1953
i honestly think finding a way to nuke the account would be the best option, nobody wins, everybody loses - can't get much more fair than that


[10/11/2022 12:06 AM] MKUltraCorp#1953

They had it for so long, that in some states, common law marriages would have taken effect.

It was like their common law Twitter account.


[10/11/2022 3:39 AM] Lingula#0929
What is the ETC community?  The fact that they continued to use an account owned by CH as the official ETC Twitter is symbolic of the lack of leadership and innovation there. Usually people in crypto pay more attention to things like passwords.


[10/11/2022 8:40 AM] vegycslol#1714
Afaik hoski bought it from an etc guy. Hoski was etc guy at the time and the seller wanted the account to go to someone who cares about etc. Hoski didn't like that etc didn't implement treasury (so he couldn't get paid for his (future) work - important to note that nobody ever said he will get paid). Because he didn't like the way things were moving in etc (strong opinions, some hoski-like famous people can't change their agenda) he decided to abandon the project and not return the twitter account. That's the story afaik and if true then it's obvious why etc community is mad at hoski and ergo

being real here, if hoski literally bought it from the guy and it wasn't just a case of stewardship then ETC is actually fucked. i can see why they were offering to buy it from him now, and as douchey as the whole situation seems, that's some serious foot shotgunning they're not coming back from

 Exactly. I think he‚Äôs brilliant in many areas but this has nothing to do with Ergo.
I‚Äôve followed him for years and have even met him. I truly believe that he wants to make the world a better place. But he believes that he should be in the top 1% of that new, free, world that he helped mold.
He‚Äôs so blinded by his narcissism that he doesn‚Äôt realize how hypocritical this rant is.

(re  : *<ziggomatic> what's he's said there isn't exactly wrong*)

but he didn't strike the match

I still support Charles‚Äô work and I‚Äôm still with ergo. 
I‚Äôm just bringing attention to how emotionally frail Charles can be at times.
I‚Äôm sure he respects Alex and the ergo community but I can‚Äôt help thinking that he wants to use it in the way Musk (one of his idols I‚Äôm betting) manipulates Doge.
If so, that‚Äôs his prerogative and right.   
It‚Äôs just something to be cognizant of


[10/11/2022 5:37 PM] ZOo M√®o#1809
in such case he's in jail but would that make convinced people innocent either ? no

 Could you go into more detail ? Don't get that vibe personally. He's a bullshitter and idealist, but I've known plenty of them, and they aren't narcissists. Maybe I'm missing something specific he's said though.

its halloween. you bought some candy at the store - payday bars, to be exact.
you hand them out to all the kids and everything is good until one of those kids decides to eat that payday bar and suddenly realizes - they are allergic to peanuts and tragically, dies.

(re @R : *Could you go into more detail ? Don't get that vibe personally. He's a bullshitter and idealist, but I've known plenty of them, and they aren't narcissists. Maybe I'm missing something specific he's said though.*) 
 
 Sorry‚Ä¶at work.
Ha well I‚Äôm just a rando sharing my opinion on the matter. I have no expertise on any of the subjects at hand.
I personally think Charles is a narcissist because of how frequently he responds so defensively to any form of criticism. He often seems arrogant and there tends to be a track record of professional relationships ending on bad terms.
Some very important, talented, and powerful people can both have amazing attributes but also be out of touch with how self involved they are.
Again, I admire the work he‚Äôs done and will continue to support ada. But he‚Äôs a complex person with a lot of influence on the crypto markets and I think his public interactions toward ergo should be analyzed and discussed!

(re  : *<MKUltraCorp> so defending yourself = narcissism, but the attackers are just fine and just keep doing what they do, yes?*) 
 
 Of course defending yourself doesn‚Äôt = narcissism.
I didn‚Äôt have enough time to write everything out so I was making a segue from my earlier posts as an example.
 In the video he posted today, Charles talks about toxic behavior and tribalism.
I stated that I agree with him 100%. But it‚Äôs hypocritical that he called etc a dead project and gifted their Twitter to ergo less than a week before he took to YT to complain about the xrp community.
I‚Äôm certain he knew doing so would piss of the etc community. 
Personally I consider that tribalistic and toxic. 
The fact that he did that, in my opinion, shows that he cares more about himself and his projects than he does with the ecosystem as a whole. 
I think that is narcissistic.

"For the rest of time, we'll just remember when we had a time where we could have made a difference but we chose not to. Because we let our pettiness, and divisiveness, and our egos get in the way. This is a perfect example of it. The leaders in your community should have stood up and said something about it. It was wrong. But they didn't. They stayed silent. They tried to take advantage of it for ratings and viewership, stoke fires. Are you happy now? Is that what you wanted?"

That's overly simplifying and mostly false in my opinion. Narcissists have excessive demand for attention and admiration, but that doesn't prevent them for saying and doing things that upset others. They lack empathy - you need empathy to be able to guess what others think and feel - key characteristics of narcissist are (see picture). I think he checks a lot of these characteristics.

Most of those traits are present in everyone to some degree ‚Ä¶ you even tick a few boxes. Narcissistic personality disorder is an extreme clinical diagnosis I do not think he meets. Maybe closer to a psychopath like many other CEOs or ‚ÄòA-Type‚Äô people if you need a label, but more of an impulsive troll than a bad actor. Or do you think ADA is a scam too? Is he some Patrick Batemen figure to you? 

Good summary and response here of all his crimes.

Forwarded from Armeanio: Yeah I'm back have been talking to Bob S from ETC. I have told him to pursue whatever he wants within Twitter to get some situational clarity. There is already a 3rd party with power in this case. 

Depending on that outcome I proposed some PoW Alliance that grants access to Twitter via tweetdeck for multiple projects. The goal to create some unified voice messaging around PoW, the benefits, and rebuilding the wreckage for miners that ETH left behind.


[10/13/2022 6:49 PM] glasgowm#0000

Forwarded from Armeanio: Twitter may have an issue and nuke the account.

If twitter makes a decision (no matter which one) then ergo will surely be seen as "the bad guys". If you turn it into a pow account then that also doesn't fix anything since it seems more like "we wanted at least something, even though we knew it was etc's account so we forced etc to go with this solution". The only good solution is to return it and say "we didn't know about the importance of this account to etc community but their community explained things to us and now we understand that that's the best way forward". This way you at least gain most of the respect back (not all, it's taking a bit too long for that) and your 600k followers have already heard about ergo so you don't lose much here either

Regarding turning the account into PoW. I'm a bit undecided on this. Overall I think it's a pretty good move IF we can convince other platforms to tweet on it. This could really backfire though if other projects want to take the high ground and refuse to use it. That could make us look even worse.
Best option imo is return to Charles, regardless of what he does with it. Wash our hands of it, this could only reflect on us positively. But we would need to do it soon.


[10/14/2022 12:29 PM] ady2333#0000

[10/14/2022 12:40 PM] Xegrilt#7685
It was sold to him so it should go back to him if ever. ETC got their handle back already at least so they can rebuild. Ultimately the existing follower can just unfollow, they're not mindless puppet.


[10/14/2022 12:48 PM] no1smove#0177
Charles didn't buy it off ETC they gave it to him to do the community management on their behalf. The deal was whoever controls the Twitter account does so for the benefit of the community, and hands it on to someone else in the community should he cease to be involved with ETC.
When he left ETC he refused to give it back, referring to it as his own personal memento. It still absolutely baffles me how a grown man could be so petty and immature. Anyway. Enough about Charles again, someone's gonna start talking about wanting to see his penis again

Can‚Äôt speak for everyone but yeh still think it was the better option, EF opinion(s) mostly the same afaik

Yes, so there is violation since the beginning. So let Twitter, the house owner, decide.


[10/14/2022 2:57 PM] R#0000
It looks like Twitter said itd be put under a temp name anyway so wouldn‚Äôt that violate their own ToS too?

So no real clarity there as Armeanio said, let Twitter decide first because they may have an issue with the account and nuke it anyway.

Even though I don‚Äôt agree with the decision I appreciate your honesty.


[10/15/2022 7:58 AM] vegycslol#1714
based on what do you believe it was a better option? the amount of bad PR ergo got from this is pretty high and, from what i can tell, all it gained was sending a "hello, here's ergo project" message to 600k followers who, when ergo started using that twitter account, also heard about the twitter account drama. So what exactly do you think makes that a worthy move?


[10/15/2022 8:01 AM] vegycslol#1714
also etc followers are the worst type of people to try and get that way, they're probably the chain with the most people who care about principles and your move is very much unprincipled

 ~3M impressions on the day, getting ergo infront of ~.5M people with related interests. Bad PR was actually very low in terms of reach and mostly from a small core group of fanatics.

also those "principled" people who disagree with me are not principled enough. It's not a binary thing and it's a shame the leaders lack this.


[10/15/2022 11:31 AM] Lingula#0929
Either the EF fear the wrath of CH, or they follow him intentionally. Either way, it drastically reduces the chance of serious investment from outside the Cardano cult. I had long hoped that Ergo would quietly distance itself from CH, ignoring him like serious investors do, but it really is becoming part of the "Cardano ecosystem" like it says in coingecko and elsewhere. Best tech doesn't always win. As long as it's seen as ADA's little brother, it will be a niche project at most. It's a shame, since it's design was clearly built to be #1.

 The sheer fact it's 'divisive' is because principled people disagree. Principles aren't binary, but they also certainly aren't universal, and not everybody needs to align themselves with your interpretation. We've had plenty of people here disagreeing with your perspective - Public polls show majority support, and the Chinese community thinks we'd be crazy to give it up. Are they all immoral? amoral? Your inability to see this nuance here demonstrates that you are in no place to be a moral adjudicator so give it a rest.

 It's the eUTXO ecosystem; it would be daft to ignore a top #10 project that we share this with. No fear of wrath, but yes - eUTXO seems like the best path forward.

[10/15/2022 11:53 AM] vegycslol#1714
let's be honest, most people want to pump their bags and feel that taking over that account increases the chances of that happening (big number of new followers etc). I claim that you have support mostly from selfish people. If you read debates on this discord you will find out that the ones who think you've made the right decision give arguments with basically 0 quality (i think it makes sense to ignore EF comments since you're obviously biased because you're the decision makers). Now sure, you can decide to keep those supporters but know that these are likely not long-term holders or can improve ergo ecosystem in any way (i'm judging this based on the quality of their arguments/replies).

I agree completely. Those arguments are very low quality. I can still appreciate well constructed argument even if I disagree with it, but this is mostly a display of red herrings, straw men and other logical fallacies. Not mentioning they sometimes sound like excuses of a five year old. I think the problem is the weak moral leadership of the community which enables people with low conscience. People who speak against it are often bullied, it may create a distorted image.


[10/15/2022 7:21 PM] ChuckBird#9809
On ergopad Twitter, I was pleasantly surprised majority of the people in comments were against it. But let's not kid ourselves here - all these noble slogan about "financial revolution" and "sovereign individual", at this point it's just marketing BS. And decentralization is the same BS, the structure may be decentralized, but developement and management of most of these projects are run like a centralized corporation. From the larger PoWs ‚Äì


[10/15/2022 7:21 PM] ChuckBird#9809
apart from BTC, the only ones that are decentrilized is RVN and maybe ETC. There are still people who believe in it I guess, but the majority of both investors and miners are in it for the money. The moment crypto was adopted by the masses it lost a lot of its grass roots values. After all - this is still a financial technology, and where there is a lot of money to be made, there is greed, selfishness and ruthlessness ...

[10/15/2022 8:37 PM] ChuckBird#9809
I did respond last time. I said it's hard to search for comments on discord from a couple of days back and not worth the effort to go through a pile of comments of people who are being dicks, it's like going through a heap of shit and I'm not a masochist. Plus I blocked those people which makes it even harder to search for. Also, it's not my style to go cry on mod's shoulder, I'll either tell them to F*-off or if I don't see any point in continuing, I'll just block them. But if I see them, I'll surely point them out to you. If I made it sound like people who are critical are being bullied all the time, I take it back, that would be unfair - I am able to express myself freely lately in here ...

Refining the analogy I'd say it's more like an older brother or an uncle who sold the kid. The rest of the family trusted the guy who bought him, thinking he'd be well looked after. But now they realise that was probably a bad idea.
Now the kid's been sent to a camp for reeducation so he learns what's good for him.


[10/17/2022 1:00 PM] R#0000
The mother sold the kid and said ‚Äòlook after him‚Äô, seems the mother might‚Äôve known something we don‚Äôt.


[10/17/2022 1:01 PM] R#0000
except instead of it being a kid with rights, it's a twitter account.


[10/17/2022 1:01 PM] no1smove#0177
I think that's a fair point


[10/17/2022 1:02 PM] no1smove#0177
But maybe the family have rights I guess


[10/17/2022 1:02 PM] no1smove#0177
Anyway I came in here looking for an advice, I was going to tag Ergo in a tweet about censorship on Ethereum but I'm still too conflicted to mention Ergo_Platform. ErgoBlockchain is too new, and looks like ergoplatformorg isn't being updated anymore. Dilemmas


[10/17/2022 1:03 PM] R#0000
tag the etc guys they have nothing better to do than concern troll other communities.

Jeeeeeesus are we comparing a Twitter page to slavery wtf lol


[10/17/2022 8:42 PM] Others#3550

Wondered where my daily dose of the twitter saga had gone, now I see there‚Äôs a channel dedicated to it!


[10/18/2022 11:25 AM] no1smove#0177
Welcome to debates! It's not all about twitter; topics range from child trafficking, tribalism, and yes even the smell of Charles Hoskinson's farts! Don't forget to screenshot your posts!

Guess we have to start talking about getting the ergo 'not-only-fans' people  to work with the Night Owl guys to come up with blockchain strip poker


[10/21/2022 5:12 PM] Milk-Stout337#7586
Hahaha ergo-fans live stream owl casino strip poker

[10/22/2022 4:37 PM] Xegrilt#7685
no one knows, but who even care tho, its not even ERG Twitter


[10/22/2022 4:37 PM] Xegrilt#7685
tho i'm sure some ppl there will find a way to blame this on either ERG or Charles or both.


[10/22/2022 5:38 PM] MKUltraCorp#1953
whoever made the @meth_classic handle on twitter to troll with is a genius


[10/22/2022 7:13 PM] Others#3550
Off to Twitter!  I wanted them to name the eth pow fork MEth for mineable eth


[10/23/2022 1:20 AM] Others#3550
Did you say you take crypto payments on your site?


[10/23/2022 1:22 AM] MKUltraCorp#1953
i do


[10/23/2022 3:34 AM] Others#3550
I got a quick question. You care if I shoot you a DM?


[10/23/2022 4:04 AM] MKUltraCorp#1953
Go for it


[10/28/2022 10:40 PM] Others#3550

Is this a tie breaker?


[11/01/2022 2:35 PM] K√µpuz <Live Laugh Love Die>#2200
I don‚Äôt think anyone ever really argued ownership. It was more a moral thing. Just because you can do something legally doesn‚Äôt make it moral.


[11/01/2022 3:19 PM] Xegrilt#7685
I think citing it as theft or robbery means arguing ownership tho. Otherwise, its like they're demanding other's possession while accusing the rightful owner of theft.. doesnt sound moral either


[11/01/2022 9:09 PM] K√µpuz <Live Laugh Love Die>#2200
I personally never looked at it as theft, just more of something that looks shady from the outside looking in. Regardless of legalities, perception is reality in the public eye. I think most peeps already forgot about it though so oh well haha


[04/08/2023 1:48 PM] Setvin#2532
yes bob may be part of a different project but he is honest and smart person we dont need to insult him. What he said was pretty reasonable, if I was in his position I would also have rejected the offer. ADA does not like ETC. That's a fact.


[04/08/2023 3:11 PM] glasgowm#9381
Huh? Respond to the wrong comment ?


[04/08/2023 3:30 PM] Setvin#2532
no


[04/08/2023 3:30 PM] Setvin#2532
you were talking about chuck being dismissive to bob


[04/12/2023 5:59 PM] Rishabh#7490

@gulliator The dev team and community have questionable morals. They also say dumb shit like this. Most of them I have zero respect for. You are an example
Twitter


[04/12/2023 6:23 PM] wombo22#5461
which part


[04/12/2023 6:23 PM] wombo22#5461
first sentence seems like he just sees stuff he doesn't agree with


[04/12/2023 6:25 PM] wombo22#5461
second part seems directed at the person, possibly annoyed people ask him to say good stuff about ergo when he just wants to mine


[04/12/2023 6:40 PM] filippounits#0000
(re  : *<Rishabh> Is he joking ?

        we should stop giving attention to this tripolar guy

Yes


[04/16/2023 10:56 PM] elazor#0115
that dude is like worthless .. no one watches him anymore lol


[04/19/2023 1:38 AM] deathgripson#2395
hes super hypocritical lately I feel like hes just taking the state of the market personally, he was part of why so many miners are idiots who dont understand how to participate in consensus though
