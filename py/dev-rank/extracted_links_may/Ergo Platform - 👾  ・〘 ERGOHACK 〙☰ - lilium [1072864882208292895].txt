[02/28/2023 7:42 PM] MGpai#4313
there is an index in register that must update by one each time the contract box is recreated


[02/28/2023 7:43 PM] MGpai#4313
then this index is used to access avl data


[02/28/2023 7:43 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Maybe a cool next step would be to try doing a random selection


[02/28/2023 7:44 PM] MGpai#4313
yes luca has this planned out
