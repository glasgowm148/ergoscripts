This thread is intended to describe and simplify one particular innovation on the #Ergo #blockchain: NIPoPoWs. 

#NiPoPoW stands for Non-Interactive Proof of Proof of Work. Let’s break this down one piece at a time.

 I def understand the maximalism aspect. But I would have to think, somewhere out there, BTC maxis would understand the value and benefit to themselves of continued exploration/research/guiding of the UTXO model.

 Also - does anyone know if Avax has been reached out to? I’m pretty sure they are UTXO.


[04/13/2022 12:02 PM] glasgowm#9381
Don't have much experience with Avax but "X and P chains are UTXO, C-Chain is running EVM, so it is account based."

Ergo is in process of developing a bridge framework that should make integration from other chains extremely easy once the bridge core is created. Just requires multisig wallets I believe. Would love to see Rosen bridge created to bridge to other UTXO Alliance projects. When it is ready and integrated on Cardano first I will share here for you guys.

Here is a video explaining: https://youtu.be/Xsiy-yPJQ6w

Dev Update March 29 | ROSEN BRIDGE | New Bridge Framework Explained
Ergo Business Manager Joseph Armeanio talks us though the new bridge framework - Rosen Bridge. In this first video in the new series of Dev Updates, Armeanio goes into more detail on a single 'core' feature of ergo. We hope you like it and find it educational. Let us know your feedback in the comments!

 For sure, with extra volume comes extra fees! People have been upping their fees to execute faster during times of high stress like an IDO so some execution bot runners have reported getting a few ERG for a single tx!


[04/14/2022 8:46 AM] HilooooYah#0000
> HilooooYah re @Gazza_ERG: For sure, with extra volume comes extra fees! ... 
 
 yes, and of course the price limited order commonly seen in a CEX, though evm model can realize this form, it is not beautiful or natural like utxo model.


[04/14/2022 8:48 AM] HilooooYah#0000
traditionally ,the higher executing fee is given to miner in the way of gas fee, but now it is the executing bot.


[04/14/2022 8:49 AM] HilooooYah#0000
hope more people engaged in this field know this.


[04/14/2022 8:51 AM] HilooooYah#0000
and of course, technical barrier is also higher than EVM AMM dex.


[04/14/2022 8:54 AM] Gazza_ERG#0000
Also eUTXO is basically designed for L2 from the start, it's not an afterthought after issues arise, this will make everything smoother in all our projects I think, luckily we already have L2 solutions on UTXO so the potential is known!


[04/14/2022 8:55 AM] HilooooYah#0000

hello,anybody knows about alephium? I read the dev docs, it seems that alph is using a on-chain smart contract to generate eutxo with lockscript. the smart contract is just like the off-chain code using by ergo and is not related to a transaction. Is it right?

 ergo smart contract on chain if you mean the ergoscript store in an eutxo.


[04/15/2022 3:01 AM] HilooooYah#0000
> HilooooYah re @C4lculista: idk about ETH 😅 
 
 but most of its code is off-chain for ergo smart contract, especially the logic to generate an output eutxo. But I see that the eutxo generating logic is on-chain for alephium.

I have launched a stake pool on Cardano this week. The purpose of the pool is to use the pool rewards to finance interchain porting and problem solving via bounties for EUTXO chains. Is it ok to promote the pool and website?


[04/15/2022 7:06 PM] Attila#0000
I have also applied for membership in the Alliance - I’ve been active in the ERG and ADA scenes as a miner and holder/community manager on a dex project, respectively.

I believe this is a functionality that is very well situated with all 3 major existing communities and naturally any UTXO based chain that can integrate into the concept.


[04/15/2022 8:21 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Cool, seems like alephium would be a good fit for you guys as well and they are in this chat too. I like the idea of the pool! Ill keep an eye on you guys

they arent eutxo but i dont think nervos is either technically?


[04/15/2022 8:22 PM] Attila#0000
I would love to hear feedback and constructive ideas as to what could be done to make this attractive to delegators (beyond lowering the fees but I would prefer to have delegators who understand the utility these fees provide)


[04/15/2022 8:22 PM] NoahErgo#0000
what are some initial bounty ideas?


[04/15/2022 8:24 PM] Attila#0000
I would like to have the communities propose problems that we could iterate on and price in, in terms of effort and reward. I would like to see the communities converge in this process and establish acceptance criteria. So the answer is it depends :)


[04/15/2022 8:25 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I think creating some initial bounties would help forming that initial community. Then once that is established could switch to voting


[04/15/2022 8:27 PM] Attila#0000
Yes, I will need to figure that out, I think I’ll be able to collect issues pretty fast. I’ll be asking around in these communities.

 BTC has a lot of forks that presumably use UTxO. 

Also Qtum is UTxO. I tried posting on Qtum's subreddit that they should join the UTxO alliance. But my post must have been filtered out by automod or something bc I never saw it land.

I operate the EUTXO pool on Cardano.

The utility of the pool is to put out bounties for porting solutions between EUTXO chains out of pool fees, and I would like to use pool rewards to extend bounties on existing unsolved programming problems on EUTXO chains that don’t need porting.

I have checked a few of such grants that the Ergo Foundation has out. Does anyone have a reasonable idea in a PM/PO capacity as to how to “bite-size” these, so that maybe I could more easily get interested devs involved? If that is feasible from the core devs’ perspective I think it would make sense to do so.

I’m thinking a smaller mental commitment may make it easier to find experienced devs who are willing to commit when a few hundred ADA is involved as a reward.

Also if anyone has suggestions regarding bounties let me know and of course, all delegations are welcome and appreciated so that we can start building up the reward pot.

we're currently working on defining the application process, i suspect it will be ready in the next few weeks. Next week we meet to discuss a rough draft and then the current members will vote on it. This way we can define the qualifiers for each new project and the responsabiliites that they will have as they join.

I like explaining UTXOs as piles of coins that you have spend entirely by aggregating piles of coins and/or splitting them. I am looking for an explanation that shows how UTXOs are created in first place by mining and creating a coinbase transaction.... was looking for what simple animation / explanations exists

“Spectrum reveals the true potential of ErgoDEX. First of all it will allow quicker and cheaper transactions. Secondly, it will have cross-chain liquidity and interoperability out of the box. Not only bridges for cross-chain transfers of assets, but truly cross-chain pools for native assets, where on one side is native ADA and on the other is native ERG. And finally, Spectrum opens the door for more sophisticated DeFi protocols such as Decentralized Lending or Option Vaults, which are impractical to build on top of many Layer 1 blockchains due to current design limitations.”

 Other than the fact they are both UTXO, I don’t think they’re really similar at all

Nervos has two layers, Layer 1 for security and Layer 2 for fast transactions.
Nervos also features bridges to other blockchains as well as the ability for dApp developers to port their existing dApps to Nervos with little configuration to its code

 Cardano has what I thought to be comparable layers. The Cardano Settlement layer (CSL) that acts as the ledger of account and the Cardano Computation Layer (CCL) that gives flexibility, scaling and speed.

 does that exist or is it just on paper?

 Exists. That’s how their network functions.

[05/31/2022 3:38 PM] jmjatlanta#0000
What problem are they solving that could not be solved by an HTLC-like contract and/or LN? I read it as if they are trying to be an oracle for chain interoperability, and there is nothing novel about that. I must be missing something.

Forwarded from Alephium - Official Announcement: *Get ready for the 1st  TTxOO *(Tech-Talks X Open Office)

❓Topic: *From Bitcoin to Alephium
*📅Date: *23th June 6pm CEST (4pm UTC)
*🧍🏻Speaker: *Hongchao,* Full-node developer at Alephium
*🙋🏾*RSVP here (https://discord.com/events/747741246667227157/984813375961841716) ⬅️

This will be the first of a regularly scheduled live event in an audio/video channel on our discord built around two distinct parts: 

  1. A presentation by one of our core-team members on topics they are interested in.
  2. An open-discussion where the audience is invited to exchange with the team live!

The first session will be held on 23rd of June 6pm CEST (4pm UTC) and feature a 20’ presentation by Hongchao titled “From Bitcoin to Alephium”, followed by the  open discussion with the team. 

Hongchao is a senior full node developer from China, based in Sweden with a passion for Bitcoin. He joined the project very early on as a part-time core developer and is now a full-time member of the team. Hongchao is not only contributing to the project as a technical wizard, his interest in philosophy and his  eloquence is highly appreciated among his fellow team-members, bringing balance and long-term perspectives to any discussion he is involved in. You can read his interview from the Core-team interview series that we published earlier this year on our Medium

 (https://medium.com/@alephium/core-team-interview-series-episode-3-64b6dacc1459#5753)Alephium’s aim with these regularly scheduled TTxOO sessions is to bring meaningful contributions to the community, maintain transparent communication between community members and the core-team, and open a regular forum for  live engagement with developers and users of all stripes! 

Hope to see you there!

Update on Rosen Bridge today:

On Rosen bridge, we got an issue with cardano asset's "figerprint" during the tests. Just found the solution and working on the fix.
The integration test is under progress. In the coming days I can provide some tangible results.

Destroying assets just sounds like a terrible idea no matter the circumstances


[06/29/2022 7:38 PM] curbsideprophetz#0000
For me personally doesn’t sound like a big deal moving once every 4 years but also someone did the math it would take 32 years to remove one whole coin (and not destroying but recirculating supply) (edit: but I guess destroy from your wallet)

Imagine you set something aside for family members and lose access for a decade (jail, disease, any major unforeseen reason really) and risk losing everything because you didn't prepare properly - once I store something on a blockchain I don't want to have to worry about it ever again, but that's me

 why?


[06/29/2022 9:07 PM] mattQuinn#0000
(re @glasgowm : *why?*) 
 
 I'd have to write it up, it seems pretty intuitive from my end


[06/29/2022 9:07 PM] mattQuinn#0000
Even the concept of utxo collection is such a back-end process, no client side thing is going to do that


[06/29/2022 9:08 PM] mattQuinn#0000
The apis that are presented by account model chains, just make sense. I'd be interested in the case for the converse that utxo chains can make useful dapps


[06/29/2022 9:12 PM] glasgowm#0000
ergomixer works pretty well) 

shared state in eth makes things easier but wouldn’t say it’s better. data-inputs, off-chain logic, etc make things a bit easier, but the account-model does have a bit of a head start


[06/29/2022 9:14 PM] mattQuinn#0000
Hmmm there's no concept of generalization with utxo dapps


[06/29/2022 9:15 PM] mattQuinn#0000
I'm bullish on utxo designs


[06/29/2022 9:16 PM] mattQuinn#0000
Similar to how accounts will never be a scalable as utxo's, I think there should also be assessments made around the fundamental constraints that keep utxos from ever being like accounts


[06/29/2022 9:16 PM] mattQuinn#0000
Assessments made or just acknowledgment/understanding, acceptance that kind of thing


[06/29/2022 9:22 PM] glasgowm#0000
(re @mattQuinn : *Hmmm there's no concept of generalization with utxo dapps*)

(re @mattQuinn : *Similar to how accounts will never be a scalable as utxo's, I think there should also be assessments made around the fundamental constraints that keep utxos from ever being like accounts*) 
 
 eutxo is an accounting model though - just not account/balance like eth. I don’t think there’s any fundamental constraints that make using a computational system over a verificiation one more practical for dApps


[06/29/2022 9:24 PM] mattQuinn#0000
(re @glasgowm : *eutxo is an accounting model though - just not account/balance like eth. I don’t think there’s any fundamental constraints that make using a computational system over a verificiation one more practical for dApps*) 
 
 What about the assumption that there's an originating account?


[06/29/2022 9:25 PM] mattQuinn#0000
Versus an unknown number of inputs/outputs


[06/29/2022 9:26 PM] mattQuinn#0000
I feel like a little bit of time with the infrastructure makes it clear where the delta is


[06/29/2022 9:28 PM] mattQuinn#0000
It seems like there will be a ton of fragmentation between dapp ecosystems on utxo chains


[06/29/2022 9:29 PM] mattQuinn#0000
Even on the same chain there will probably be different standards


[06/29/2022 9:34 PM] mattQuinn#0000
From a dapp devs perspective:

Reading data from and sending a message to an object (account) is very different from needing to query for all possibly relevant data then structure a call through functional programs (utxo)


[06/29/2022 9:38 PM] RennyHodler#0000
(re @mattQuinn : *From a dapp devs perspective:

 that last part sounds scary. 'all possibly relevant data' sounds like you would need to make assumptions or understand the entire schema perfectly.   Of course im also missing some hands on context..


[06/29/2022 9:39 PM] glasgowm#0000

 standards for what? is this a bad thing?

(re @mattQuinn : *From a dapp devs perspective:

Reading data from and sending a message to an object (account) is very different from needing to query for all possibly relevant data then structure a call through functional programs (utxo)*) 
 
 account/imperative make more sense at first / are easier to understand but don’t think they make sense for blockchain (and don’t think people put off by functional should be building the next generation of defi/economy)

 no doubt inexperienced devs will find tons of new weird and wonderful ways to mess it up especially as it matures. But will end up with a much more robust overall system

`query Addresses {
  addresses(addresses: ["9hY16vzHmmfyVBwKeFGHvb2bMFsG94A1u7To1QWtUokACyFVENQ"], atHeight: 689000) {

 Exactly - that's why the desperate ETH maxis really annoy me lately with their 'eth/evm won, everything that's happening in this space is going to revolve around eth' narrative. Any kind of maximalism is unproductive, but this short sighted arrogance is just weak af

 But but its sound money, it the internet, its turning POS, its this its that, it seems though most ETH maxis dont even understand blockchain IMO whats a VM again? the tide will turn at some point when they realise a lot of our chains arent coming to hook up to ETH, we're coming to wipe up its mess

https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1542861884965224450?s=20&t=ndRIp0mPBVqpqgqnkOwEBA*) 
 
 you'd still need to setup account, go through the process of config GCP, etc. so it's still dev focused just like every other explorer backend repo out there. 
with azorus you just hop on and start coding/visualizing the data right away and not have to worry about any of the backend setup
(pretty sweet share though will have to do one for ergo now)

Forwarded from Alephium - Official Announcement: 📢 *Cheng will be speaking at EthCC 5 

*📆 July 19th, 11:30am - 11:55am (CEST)
📍 Pontoise Room
❓ *"Account Model meets UTXO: a new paradigm for secure dApps & DeFi"

*_We propose a new model combining the expressiveness of account model and the security gains of UTXO model. We will show how a new paradigm could resolve/mitigate issues like unlimited authorization, reentrancy attack, MEV, etc. We built a brand new virtual machine and a smart contract language to make it easier and friendlier for developers to code securely.

_It'll be fascinating for you if you're about UTXO, dApps and DeFi

I am with the Ergo Foundation.  I wanted to drop an invitation to the BCH developer community to join the UTXO Alliance, a research-oriented group focused on research/collaboration between UTXO blockchains.    Ergo specifically at this point is interested in interop via sidechains, that is one of our development goals in 2022. Let me know if any...

 I think introspection is enabling Turing completeness, as shown in https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Self-Reproducing-Coins-as-Universal-Turing-Machine-Chepurnoy-Kharin/05c6514c671d380cb2aa02ffa504bb4faca7b92c , however that does not mean feasibility of certain applications. Sidechaining is another beast, would be good to think jointly what is needed there.

Emulating OP_EVAL using Bitcoin Cash Native Introspection Opcodes (...
The contract allows for two spending paths. It is a simple construction just to demonstrate the capability to emulate OP_EVAL …

op_eval would really be an optimization of functionality already available using the VM

So UTXO alliance now consists of Nervos, Cardano, Ergo and Topl, right? Are they all PoS and with centralized protocol development? How would BCH join this alliance when there's no "official" entity? I'm interested as individual. BCH has 6 node teams, I guess any one joining would count as "BCH" :D

I can share with you some BCH-specific research, some concepts I believe apply generally to all UTXO chains: the P2SH feature introduced to Bitcoin in 2012 is a more general "hash of a spending constraint" kind of thing, that can support multiple VMs for the underlying constraint on the utxo etc.. the section on quantum resistance may be interesting to broader audience: https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/announcements/-/blob/master/2022-06-09_bitcoin_cash_pay_to_script_hash_p2sh_past_present_and_future_EN.md#5-post-quantum-cryptographic-security-level

 Nervos and Ergo are PoW, there are efforts to decentrallize development in Ergo, but the core is pretty visible still

New layer 1 dex heading to Nervos. UTXO dex to be exact,  and not to be confused with our layer 2 projects etc people should take a look at this project with a decentralise SIRI to help make investment decisions and achieve passive incomes. Full autonomous too and looking for developers to learn our UTXO model for NervosNetwork

 Nervos first layer is POW


[07/26/2022 10:45 AM] Cr00kednervosness#0000
our layer 2 and gaming side chain are EVM compatible and no doubt will eventially be POS


[07/26/2022 11:28 AM] bitcoincashautist#0000
you have a L1 PoW UTXO and L2 PoW EVM? how did you bridge them? We have smartBCH in the pipeline as EVM side-chain but the bridge hasn't materialized yet.. it was supposed to be PoW/PoS but I think sBCH team will move to pure PoS with multisig on mainchain

 We also have bridged to ETH and BSC. So can move funds across, we have a layer one Cardano bridge in progress too

 The l2 is not POW. It’s POA currently until we move to POS on our layer 2 at a later date.

[07/26/2022 11:33 AM] Cr00kednervosness#0000
Layer one POW (Mirana),  Layer 2 POA (Godwoken) Gaming  side chain POA (Axon) (Coming soon). We are a modular system all built by the same team ;-) they all work in unison


[07/26/2022 11:33 AM] bitcoincashautist#0000
you'll probably be able to bridge with BCH at some point, token primitives are in the pipeline for '23 so you can have persistent state


[07/26/2022 11:34 AM] Cr00kednervosness#0000
soon in the future POA will turn into POS and the path to decentralisation  will be complete. Our layer one is BTC but improved consensus. And already is permissionless and no white list needed to launch on it. It’s exciting times for us.

(re @bitcoincashautist : *can you have "type script"-only cells? where anyone can spend it as long as he satisfies the program's requirements?*) 
 
 @mattQuinn can explain that deeper. But once you use up cells to deploy on layer one. Later you can get the tokens back. So if you was a dev and your project didn’t work even at a later stage if CKB grows in price you can make money like that too. CKB is a utility token that even in a bear market once projects are locked in. The token use increases security and accrues actual value. Not sure if any other token that accrues value like that. The more locked up, the more scarce, halvings every 4 years , unlimited supply to help grow the network. It’s scar with through infinity

oh yeah that reminds me, I'll c&p from elsewhere: the idea of a fee pool has been with me for a long time.. I don't know if anyone's tried to work it out but something like this: instead of claiming the whole block's fee, pass  on like 50% for the next block.. whomever mines the next block gets the 50% of the passed on fee + 50% of the current fees + passes on half of that block's fees... on average it  would be the same block reward BUT, in case of 1 block with a huge fee, there's no incentive to reorg it since you  can get the same amount by mining the next block, and then the next block..  and the massive fee from  that 1 block decays and is spread across future blocks


[07/26/2022 12:01 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000

 Wow this is amazing! Great theoretical framework, I think of UTXOs in exactly the same way. BCH was just the first payload for the cells, and the first "contract", hard-coded by C++ consensus code but still a contract enforcing rules over how the cell's state may evolve

>To own a cell, you need tokens. The number of tokens equals the size of the cell. 1 CKB = 1 Byte.

nice.. we kinda have that with the "dust limit" on UTXOs, but it's fixed at 546b/UTXO not 1sat/1b as you have there


[07/26/2022 1:13 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
turns out this is really important to have right incentives


[07/26/2022 1:13 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
our token UTXOs will still need BCH dust to exist, and that will give incentive to clean up UTXOs of zombie tokens


[07/26/2022 1:16 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
>The answer is simple: code is in another cell!

>We know that the data field of the cell can contain arbitrary data, so we can put the real code in the data field of another cell and implement this cell as a dependency to a transaction. This dependency cell is called “dep cell”.

>When unlocking a cell, we simply import the dep cell, and CKB will match the hash of the data in the dep cell with code_hash to find the corresponding code.

amazing, we call this "sidecar" contract design pattern, only made possible with May'22 upgrade, allows us to emulate OP_EVAL

>In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively. We present Extended UTXO (EUTXO), an extension to Bitcoin’s UTXO model that supports a substantially more expressive form of validation scripts, including scripts that implement general state machines and enforce invariants across entire transaction chains.

Damn, this sounds much like Group Tokens / Unforgeable Categories / CashTokens we have been working on


[07/26/2022 1:34 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
when I got involved I just wanted tokens but we figured out it solves a more fundamental problem of enforcing those invariants

(re @HL_Lysis : *Guess I'll have to dig into BCH a bit - tbh I've never looked at it again much after the fork*) 
 
 my conjecture is that most people see BCH as "pre-segwit BTC but with big blocks", and also there's a lot of bad PR due to war for the "Bitcoin" title


[07/26/2022 1:45 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
but with upgrades since the fork, and especially the '22 upgrade, BCH became much more, soon to have oracles and hedge contracts..


[07/26/2022 1:46 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
we still have missing pieces (to build those persistent entities, tx chain invariants), which '23 upgrade will hopefully activate

Hello CKB UTXO fam


[07/26/2022 2:52 PM] NPCcrypto#0000
People have their different motives to be here, for me it's the security standard that UTXO brings to the table


[07/26/2022 2:52 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Scalability is very natural with utxo too


[07/26/2022 2:53 PM] NPCcrypto#0000
Yeah I think all UTXOs at least share these two tenets


[07/26/2022 2:54 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
like... the soft-fork upgrade approach of BTC means that complexity of your node code only grows, and for what benefit, so some old nodes can be fooled into staying in consensus? and whatever soft-fork solutions will always be sub-optimal because they must be done in these convoluted ways... with taproot they now have 3 instances of a VM nested in each other you have "bare", then P2SH, then SegWit, then Taproot

hard-fork makes it possible to properly evolve the tech, the only thing to be careful about is breaking userspace... you break other nodes (non-upgraded fall out of netwok) but you MUST NOT break application APIs


[07/26/2022 2:55 PM] NPCcrypto#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *Scalability is very natural with utxo too*) 
 
 That's why I'm for including BTC even if it's dinosaur tech. It's the gold standard of security and relies on UTXO scalability methods as much as we do


[07/26/2022 2:55 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
I'm assuming you all have monolithic projects with centralized dev teams so I think it's easy to upgrade your consensus


[07/26/2022 2:56 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
BCH had to invent its own way to keep going, and had to fork a few more times (BCH/BSV and BCH/XEC splits) until things could stabilize


[07/26/2022 2:57 PM] NoahErgo#0000
(re @bitcoincashautist : *I'm assuming you all have monolithic projects with centralized dev teams so I think it's easy to upgrade your consensus*) 
 
 This is not true for ergo at least. Bootstrapped from zero using PoW. Tiny fraction of emission goes to treasury (4% or so) for development fund but otherwise everything fair launched and open source


[07/26/2022 2:58 PM] NoahErgo#0000

Well its a hard fork so they can continue to run it but it will be a dead chain


[07/26/2022 3:07 PM] NPCcrypto#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *Well its a hard fork so they can continue to run it but it will be a dead chain*) 
 
 BTC didn't run the new software of bch and it's not a dead chain


[07/26/2022 3:07 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
no, because the upgrade was contentious


[07/26/2022 3:07 PM] NPCcrypto#0000
Most are


[07/26/2022 3:07 PM] NoahErgo#0000
yes but i can assure you current cardano version will be a dead chain lol


[07/26/2022 3:07 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
but after '17, BCH had a few non-contentious "hard" upgrades


[07/26/2022 3:08 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
(re @NoahErgo : *yes but i can assure you current cardano version will be a dead chain lol*) 
 
 that's because everyone will upgrade, right


[07/26/2022 3:08 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
same like our scheduled BCH upgrades


[07/26/2022 3:08 PM] NoahErgo#0000
If a community of people arose around keeping a certain node version alive they could


[07/26/2022 3:08 PM] NPCcrypto#0000
(re @bitcoincashautist : *that's because everyone will upgrade, right*) 
 
 Which is easy to get people to do when they've already forked from majority consensus like bch


[07/26/2022 3:09 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
not so easy, BCH was split 2 more times, because those that forked BCH from BTC couldn't agree how to continue evolving it


[07/26/2022 3:10 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
right now it feels more stable, May '22 and May '21 upgrades went smoothly, only 1 chain resulted


[07/26/2022 3:10 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
and I'd argue May'22  is the biggest upgrade Bitcoin has seen since genesis - allow you to pass arguments to UTXO functions by reference (get data from other parts of the TX) and not just by value


[07/26/2022 3:12 PM] NoahErgo#0000
I think if you can find ways for bch to be collaborative with other chains that should be primary goal for this channel rather than us getting stuck in the weeds on which methodology is better. We all have our favorite chains and reasons xyz chain does things. But would be cool to see some ways we can bring bch into the fold in a productive way whether it be with cross chain collaboration or something else like wrapped bch


[07/26/2022 3:12 PM] NoahErgo#0000

 I think all in this channel share the same methodology, the "hard" upgrade methodology, BTC would be the only outlier :)


[07/26/2022 3:15 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
it's just that your projects were built from scratch so there were never controversial upgrades, hope that it stays that way, bch showed how ugly it can be and how it can set the project back for years


[07/26/2022 3:15 PM] NoahErgo#0000
We had one. Originally ergo was buit as mining pool resistant so solo mine only, and smart users found ways to bypass that with smart contracts


[07/26/2022 3:15 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
ETH had only 1 controversial upgrade: the DAO hack


[07/26/2022 3:16 PM] Cr00kednervosness#0000
(re @HL_Lysis : *Ah it's not meant for normal investors - imo it's one of the best tools we have to get devs excited about nervos without having to read a ton of docs or watch vids*) 
 
 Yeah exactly. So good for the autists lol


[07/26/2022 3:16 PM] NoahErgo#0000
It became more equitable to allow pool mining after that as it opened up doors to all miners rather than just a handful who could pool


[07/26/2022 3:17 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Would result in nasty hashrate consolidation if it didnt fork


[07/26/2022 3:17 PM] NoahErgo#0000
open to 51% attacks


[07/26/2022 3:18 PM] NoahErgo#0000
but yeah the ETH fork is egregious example of forking


[07/26/2022 3:23 PM] NPCcrypto#0000
(re @bitcoincashautist : *I think all in this channel share the same methodology, the "hard" upgrade methodology, BTC would be the only outlier :)*) 
 
 Not really, most chains in here have done hard forks at one point or another . I think both methods have obvious tradeoffs. Yeah a hardfork is fine when it's not contentious that's kind of the point, and more contentious things could come in the form of soft. but BCH formed from a very contentious hardfork


[07/26/2022 3:41 PM] NPCcrypto#0000
(re @bitcoincashautist : *I think all in this channel share the same methodology, the "hard" upgrade methodology, BTC would be the only outlier :)*) 
 
 I think Bitcoin became increasingly hard to upgrade as the user base grew and needed more consensus for major changes. Some think it's a victim of its own success, and others think it saved the decentralization of the network to not fork away with BCH camp


[07/26/2022 3:47 PM] NPCcrypto#0000
Some see both networks having their own advantages and the ability to coexist. I'd like to see Bitcoin and all its forks in this alliance if possible. Cuz this isn't the blockchain snob alliance, it's the UTXO alliance , so let's get every UTXO in here

 it's not just hard.. it's impossible.. they could've used the same SegWit hack to increase the blocksize more radically than moving just the witness over to the appendix.. you could soft-fork 32MB blocks into existence as extension blocks or w/e... they could've soft-forked token primitives too, let BTC have native tokens... plenty of possibilites even with the soft-fork method, but more technical debt down the line - still doable tho, and old nodes would happily accept 1MB blocks even though they'd just contain root hashes for actual blocks being processed by new nodes

 I could see Andreas type folks possibly being on board with it. I'd just think it would show a good sign of unity in an ecosystem of differing opinions. Like the unlikely way that BTC and Cardano folks can be brought together. It's interesting to consider

 Yeah I could see the cell model interacting w the layer 2


[07/26/2022 4:14 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
like,  what's the fundamental primitive of our blockchains? is there a hierarchy? imagine you strip utxos of all fields - that's the most fundamental primitive. Give it a satoshi amount and a spending constraint field and you have Bitcoin, give it more and you have a defi capable blockchain


[07/26/2022 4:14 PM] NoahErgo#0000
@bitcoincashautist ergo is working on a new bridge framework that could fairly easily be deployed to any chains that support multisig. Maybe you could drum up some interest in bch dev community when its ready to be deployed

(re @bitcoincashautist : *like... the soft-fork upgrade approach of BTC means that complexity of your node code only grows, and for what benefit, so some old nodes can be fooled into staying in consensus? and whatever soft-fork solutions will always be sub-optimal because they must be done in these convoluted ways... with taproot they now have 3 instances of a VM nested in each other you have "bare", then P2SH, then SegWit, then Taproot

hard-fork makes it possible to properly evolve the tech, the only thing to be carefu...*) 
 
 Soft forks seem quite elegant in practice, it's a major pain to get an ecosystem to upgrade


[07/26/2022 4:22 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
I'd say they're more convenient but not elegant, because SFs only need miner support and partial node support whereas "hard" upgrades need all nodes to upgrade. We recently realized that even with "hard" upgrades - breaking userspace is the thing where one needs to be careful, here's some research on upgrading our TX format in non-breaking way (still breaks nodes if HF, but not other tx-parsing software):  https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/announcements/-/blob/master/2021-12-23_evaluate_viability_of_transaction_format_or_id_change_EN.md

 we can really try to include as many chains as possible into the efforts. The alliance can get more awareness with camps like BCH, and they Can get more awareness with the alliance that's  trying to push forward the design paradigm which we're all a part of

Cross UTXO compatibility will have to be a group effort, but it will unlock so much security for the space. That's why I try to get bitcoin groups interested in the alliance, it seems like it can become a real large academic pursuit


[07/31/2022 6:12 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
Abstractly I look at it much like those "cells" described by Nervos docs. Fundamentally, UTXO is just a data row where what we call "outpoint" (txid+outputindex) is the row's database key - the only state of that fundamental primitive is exists/does_not_exist (spent/unspent). Then, we add a lock on that container to control permission, and we add some more state to the container, and consensus rules define how the state may transition from state to state. With '23 upgrade, we'll also be extending our UTXOs to carry more payload :D

(re @NPCcrypto : *Cross UTXO compatibility will have to be a group effort, but it will unlock so much security for the space. That's why I try to get bitcoin groups interested in the alliance, it seems like it can become a real large academic pursuit*) 
 
 and btw, a new coin launched recently, started from BCH codebase but launched with a new genesis block and different algo, by guys from Bitcoin Unlimited, which supports native UTXO tokens (Andrew Stone's "Group Tokenization"), too. They're designing a wallet with more abstract representation of UTXOs so it can more easily support both coins, but who knows, maybe it can support more:

"also, a new release of wally wallet is out. This release comprises a significant refactoring of the underlying blockchain and wallet library to create a general UTXO architecture blockchain representation and then to specialize these classes with both Nexa and Bch implementations."

I mentioned UTXO Alliance to them, too :)

Some progress on rosen bridge, hopefully will be able to bring some utxo chains together soon!


[08/10/2022 6:29 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Forwarded from ErgoBridgeBot: <mhs_sam> On Rosen:
- the bridge has been tested part by part (ergo watchers, cardano watchers, scanner service, payment service, guard service, p2p network, multisig and threshold sig, etc). bugs found and fixed.
- now it's time to deploy the whole bridge and do the final integration test. 
- This weekend, we're deploying the bridge in local ergo mainnet and cardano testnet.
- So, I can say that the development has been ended and we're in the final test stage. Sure there will be some bugs to be fixed and some changes to be made.
- I'll update the github repo in a few days.

meanwhile, there are some considerations that can affect the tokenomics. 
- For example, should we use the highest possible number of guards , e.g. 100 or 200 guards? or we should use much less guards, however a big enough number, say 15 guards for example, with more skin in the game? 
- We're testing the possible combinations to find out the technical limitations (max guard set number) and the impact on security and performance.
- Based on these experiments, we're discussing the economic incentives and other aspects of different configurations.

so EUTXO has 3 enhancements: 1. context 2. "datum" 3. time interval


[08/16/2022 3:24 AM] bitcoincashautist#0000
how is time interval enforced? Bitcoin has OP_CHECKLOCKTIME but that's only the lower bound, how do you enforce the upper bound?


[08/16/2022 3:26 AM] bitcoincashautist#0000
BCH got "context" in '18 but it was awkward, in '22 we added opcodes to access specific parts of TX context (opcode to retrieve any input/prevout/output's data from the local TX context) so we got context, right? In May '23 we'll activate CashTokens which will get us the "datum", and I'm wondering about 3. time interval, we already have half of it, how to get the other half?

 to clarify, this is transaction expiration?

(re @HL_Lysis : *utxo-alliance.org is a good place to start (and apply)

 hi @Kaspa_HypeMan  - have you checked the website? https://utxo-alliance.org/


[08/16/2022 3:04 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
(re @mattQuinn : *to clarify, this is transaction expiration?*) 
 
 yeah like "cannot be mined after time T2"


[08/16/2022 3:05 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
we have the opcode for "cannot be mined before time T1"


[08/16/2022 3:09 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
but the expiration one would be tricky, because it'd require mempool eviction... right now we have the first seen rule and allow long unconfirmed chains, if validity of some tx in the mempool would change because of block height, that would make mempool management less performant as nodes would need to evict not only the invalid TX but also all dependent TXes (the whole unconfirmed chain)


[08/16/2022 3:12 PM] mattQuinn#0000
(re @bitcoincashautist : *we have the opcode for "cannot be mined before time T1"*) 
 
 checking, we have "cannot be mined before time T1" but not sure how the opposite would be accomplished


[08/16/2022 3:15 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
"The third change is that we provide some access to time by adding a validity
interval to transactions. This is an interval of ticks (see Subsection 3.3) during
which a transaction can be processed (a generalisation of a “time-to-live”). Thus,
any scripts which run during validation can assume that the current tick is within
that interval, but do not know the precise value of the current tick"

(re @mattQuinn : *checking, we have "cannot be mined before time T1" but not sure how the opposite would be accomplished*) 
 
 it could be accomplished by hacking it using the "cannot be mined before T1"... you make it so that some alternative spending path (like refund or burn) can spend it after T2 but cannot be mined before T2, but that requires interaction and failing to produce the refund TX would let the other path go after T2

 Thanks Noah! The Rosen Bridge is definetely something already in our radar but our devs don't have much bandwith currently as we're working on our upcoming network upgrade and wormhole based-bridge. It would anyway be helpful to know the requirements so when we are ready to get started we can jump right in. 

We're also looking at non-technical collaboration opportunities like events, AMA, hackathons, podcasts, meet-ups, educational, etc to promote, emulate each other and the Alliance.

[09/03/2022 8:33 AM] bitcoincashautist#0000
oh yeah, you're using multisig on the other chain right... you can use bch's P2SH multisig, it'll be safe against collisions with activation in May because we will support 2 P2SH templates (the old '12 BIP16 one with HASH160, and new pattern with HASH256)


[09/03/2022 8:33 AM] bitcoincashautist#0000
and utxo native tokens can be bridged the same way, since they're essentialy dual-currency outputs (bch + token, locked with the same lock - the multisig)


[09/03/2022 8:35 AM] bitcoincashautist#0000
for BTC you gotta use segwit P2WSH to have 256-bit security (128 against collisions)

https://forum.cardano.org/t/why-do-we-need-ttl-time-to-live-when-creating-transaction/52288
Why do we need TTL(Time to Live) when creating transaction
Hi, I am going through the Cardano stake pool course, and part of building a transaction using the cardano-cli is to provide a TTL number which specifies the upper bound slot number that our transaction must be included in a block for it to be a valid transaction. What is the reason for this? Why do we need a TTL?


[09/10/2022 11:40 AM] bitcoincashautist#0000
but can you build unconfirmed chains on top of that? what happens when the TTL expires, you gotta evict the whole unconfirmed chain from mempool


[09/10/2022 11:44 AM] HL_Lysis#0000
(re @bitcoincashautist : *this I believe https://forum.cardano.org/t/why-do-we-need-ttl-time-to-live-when-creating-transaction/52288*) 
 
 great explanation 'we need it because we need it in some cases so might aswell make it mandatory' 👏


[09/10/2022 11:46 AM] bitcoincashautist#0000
we don't have that with BCH, but I know how we could emulate it, a "clock" covenant instanced for each contract that is time-sensitive, but requires interaction, someone^tm must advance the clock by posting new TXes


[09/10/2022 11:46 AM] bitcoincashautist#0000
anyway, one guy was rambling how BCH needs TTL or it will go to 0 lmao


[09/10/2022 11:47 AM] HL_Lysis#0000
it's already at 0 🤔


[09/10/2022 11:48 AM] bitcoincashautist#0000
but like.. we don't want TTL because it'd mess with descendant unconfirmed chains... and suggestion was to require maturation of outputs that come from TTL txes, but then you have to wait for X blocks for the next TX


[09/10/2022 11:48 AM] bitcoincashautist#0000
so I wondered, how other blockchains reasoned about this

[09/10/2022 11:57 AM] bitcoincashautist#0000
ok but once verified it can't become invalid after some time?


[09/10/2022 11:57 AM] bitcoincashautist#0000
you have the "since" which is equivalent to bch OP_CLTV


[09/10/2022 11:58 AM] bitcoincashautist#0000
but there's no "until"


[09/10/2022 11:58 AM] bitcoincashautist#0000
that would be equivalent to cardano TTL


[09/10/2022 12:03 PM] HL_Lysis#0000
not sure we have any cardano devs in here really - better to ask them directly


[09/10/2022 12:03 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
anyway, I feel like we don't need TTL, although then we can consider ourselves to be only 2.5/3 "e"UTXO haha

[09/10/2022 12:14 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
Forwarded from HeptaSean: There won't usually be other transactions building on a transaction, before it is included in a block. So, there is no chain to be evicted in most cases.

I think, there was just one wallet app up to now that experiments with chained transactions. Those have to be put into the mempool in the right order, so that the input UTxOs to the later transactions are there. If they are not (because TTL of previous transaction expired or for other reasons), the transaction will just be discarded as invalid.

In a way your “prohibit spending the outputs until they mature” has always been there: The input UTxOs of a transaction have to be in a previous block and they still have to be unspent. That is one of the basic requirements independently of the TTL feature.

ohhh sweet... BitcoinUnlimited was working on something like that, but simpler, never got implemented though.. I think Nexa (new coin launched by BU team) has it though: https://spec.nexa.org/nexa/sighashtype

I created this guide for those who lost their savings due to vile scammers, I also faced the fact that I lost my funds on investments in a fraudulent company, after which I began to persistently look for a way to get my money back and I found it, I spent a lot of time but I really found what works and I got my money back.

We’ll talk about the ErgoHack V organized with Flux, DjedAlliance & Alephium and exchange about Ergo & the fabulous community of Ergonauts, the UTXO Alliance, and so much more! 

If the name Alexander “Kushti” Chepurnoy tells you something, it’s because he’s a star! He's been in crypto since 2011, worked with Charles Hoskinson on Cardano after being a core-dev at NXT & Chainlink Labs!

[10/09/2022 1:34 PM] HL_Lysis#0000
there's been some confusion from projects about how to join and the general purpose/structure of the alliance (namely BEAM and GRIN) - do they require a central entity to join, what's the avenue for contribution from individual contributors etc


[10/09/2022 1:38 PM] HL_Lysis#0000

Thanks everyone who joined the *kick-off call* held on Oct 6. It is great to see conversations on various topics getting some forward movement. This is already a win!
To gain even more momentum join our new platform, where the bulk of new conversations will occur: 

👉 UTXO Alliance Discord [https://discord.com/channels/1028117152370274365/1028914218474422362].

*If you are too busy to read the whole message, please read the Actions Recap at the bottom.* Here are the meeting notes and next actions:


*1️⃣ Top objectives of the UTXO Alliance 
*i. Joint collaboration to solve instrumental questions on information processing in blockchains ie. the Blockchain Trilemma, operational energy & end-user costs.

ii. Importance of growing the presence of the UTXO model as a legitimate compute paradigm capable of meeting the demands of the industry.

*2️⃣ UTXO Alliance Workstreams
*Since our goals tap into different areas of work, during the call we validated five workstreams to structure our efforts. These are presented below and are subject to evolve:

1. Technical Leadership
2. Marketing & Community
3. UTXO Art Alliance
4. UTXO Meetups
5. Commercial Arm
.
*3️⃣ Kick-off call highlights
*i. We settled on a monthly cadence for an *All Hand Meeting*, ie. first Wednesday of the month (next call: Nov the 2nd). We unanimously regarded the existence of spaces for conversations with high importance. 

ii. On a similar note, we prioritized kicking-off the *Technical Leadership* workstream. We are gathering highly technical people from all teams in a call happening on Oct 25, meeting agenda coming soon by ignacio.calderondelab@iohk.io.

iii. As part of *Marketing & Community* WBL has already taken the initiative to collaborate on content creation in podcast-style that covers topics of interest of the Alliance. Glad to learn more about this from smacurdy@wolfram.com. 

iv. In the interest of growing a *Com <clipped message>

Hi, I wonder how coins other than BCH consider zero conf transactions. BCH doesn't have replace by fee (RBF) and it's generally acceptable to use 0 confirmation transaction for smaller amounts. They also implemented a double spend proof[1] in many nodes to make it safer.

I've also heard that the miners on BCH uses the first seen rule.

Reason why I'm asking is I would like to ask AtomicDEX team to allow zero confirmation transactions as it currently the minimum allowed confirmations is 1.

[10/31/2022 5:14 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
(re @mattQuinn : *Is it standing up something that's out there?*) 
 
 sry I don't understand this question. Some cryptos have their own stackexchange sites (like bitcoin, ethereum, cardano) but generally they're not so friendly towards other coins, especially the bitcoin site. And the staging site to create new communities apparently has the policy of not allowing new coin pages, but the're open to having a general crypto page so...

[10/31/2022 5:17 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
it's a few clicks to "apply" the hard part is to do the steps that come after


[10/31/2022 5:17 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
show there's enough community interest to bootstrap the site and keep it lively


[10/31/2022 5:17 PM] mattQuinn#0000
Got it


[10/31/2022 5:18 PM] mattQuinn#0000
I do think it being utxo focused is great


[10/31/2022 5:18 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
that was my idea but is not the direction if it'll be titled "cryptocurrencies" I guess everything would be welcome then, and we'd use labels to keep things tidy


[10/31/2022 5:19 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
it would be good to have a diverse bunch work their way up to high points so it doesn't happen that all moderators are from the same camp


[10/31/2022 5:20 PM] mattQuinn#0000
I think just make a new one


[10/31/2022 5:21 PM] mattQuinn#0000
If you get account model stuff in there it's such a different paradigm it shouldn't be mixed


[10/31/2022 5:22 PM] NoahErgo#0000
Utxo alliance stackexchange is a cool idea

This proposal is in:
Definition

The topic and audience are still being decided. It needs:

    59 more followers
    40 more questions with a score of 10 or more

to move to the next phase.

[10/31/2022 5:31 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
it can be a general crypto SE, no need to be utxo-alliance specific


[10/31/2022 5:31 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
but if we do the work, we'll be seeding it with q&as about our beloved coins


[10/31/2022 5:46 PM] mattQuinn#0000
Do you feel any concern about it getting overrun with people writing inline Solidity?


[10/31/2022 5:47 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
nah, they have ethereum SE for that, and besides it's not taking away anything from others.. you can filter your interests by using labels, and useless questions don't get good scores anyway


[10/31/2022 7:24 PM] melroyvandenberg#0000
(re @bitcoincashautist : *cardano has their own site so they don't give a/f*) 
 
 they will be merged together, together with Bitcoin, Solana and more crypto/blockchain projects on Stack Exchange.


[10/31/2022 7:24 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
I imagine they'd resist the idea of merging into a general site


[10/31/2022 7:25 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000

after all they decided to no longer accept new crypto specific SE sites


[11/01/2022 1:59 PM] melroyvandenberg#0000
so if there is a common SE site for cryptocurrency. When reading that post, I assume they should combine the different cryptos. And use labels instead.


[11/01/2022 1:59 PM] melroyvandenberg#0000
"Bitcoin" for BTC. "Ethereum" for ETH, etc. etc.

"Private Beta. The most important phase. This is the actual, live site set up on a "probationary" basis to see if people use it. It is very important to participate early. The earliest questions set the tone and topic of the site for a long time. This is also the time to spread the word via Twitter, blogs, and email far and wide. If the site does not establish a self-sustaining community and a healthy volume of high-quality questions and answers within up to 5 weeks, it will be deleted."

@bitcoincashautist fyi might have a simple way of doing expiring transactions on ckb

Generalized lock script to check conditions in witness args

Include a block height in witness args, attempt to load the header at that height, if call succeeds revert


[12/08/2022 6:12 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
oh you can load a header? cool, does it have to be mature or can you like load the header of a previous block?


[12/08/2022 6:13 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
on bch we can't load headers... so the only way to have expiry is to implement a covenant clock, and then there would be a spending path to require spending a clock utxo alongside the input and similarly revert


[12/08/2022 6:15 PM] mattQuinn#0000
(re @bitcoincashautist : *oh you can load a header? cool, does it have to be mature or can you like load the header of a previous block?*) 
 
 Nope, no maturity required


[12/08/2022 6:15 PM] mattQuinn#0000
Any previous block


[12/08/2022 6:15 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
right, then I guess your mempool somehow must be handling a reorg, in which case it would have to evict all txes that load the header


[12/08/2022 6:15 PM] mattQuinn#0000
Yep


[12/08/2022 6:15 PM] mattQuinn#0000
The header loads are included like inputs


[12/08/2022 6:16 PM] mattQuinn#0000
Explicit


[12/08/2022 6:17 PM] mattQuinn#0000
Actually it might invalidate the tx..


[12/08/2022 6:17 PM] mattQuinn#0000
Not sure.. @TannrA was saying you could error handle a failed header load


[12/08/2022 6:19 PM] TannrA#0000
Yeah, if you load a header that doesn’t get included, other dependencies that use it are thrown away


[12/08/2022 6:20 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
right, on bch we stick to a principle: the validity of tx can't change with time. The only TX that could change is the coinbase TX, and to avoid mempool mess we require it to mature for 100 blocks before it can be spent

why we like that principle? because then you can safely build huge unconfirmed chains of TXes.. now imagine if validity would change, then you'd have to potentially evict a huge number of descendant TXes in the mempool, which would increase complexity and reduce performance


[12/08/2022 6:21 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
do you allow unconfirmed chains? or does the header-referencing TX have to wait inclusion in a block before another TX can spend its outputs?


[12/08/2022 6:22 PM] TannrA#0000
You can chain together a bunch of unconfirmed txs


[12/08/2022 6:23 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
so I guess you optimized your mempool code so it can handle an ancestor becoming invalid (because the header it loads got reorged) and so efficiently pop all descendants from the mempool?


[12/08/2022 6:23 PM] TannrA#0000
While it doesn’t create need for sort of garbage collection, the dependencies rly just form a simple DAG so it isn’t too difficult to clean up


[12/08/2022 6:23 PM] TannrA#0000
Does *


[12/08/2022 6:24 PM] mattQuinn#0000
So header deps is referred to by hash

I was thinking you could do by height


[12/08/2022 6:24 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
yeah, that's how I'd have proposed it for bch... reference it by hash


[12/08/2022 6:25 PM] mattQuinn#0000
It makes sense


[12/08/2022 6:25 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
so you guys can handle unconfirmed chains and a whole DAG getting evicted if an ancestor becomes invalid due to reorg, that's pretty cool!


[12/08/2022 6:53 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000

Apparently Nervos (CKB) supports block header introspection and their mempool code can handle evicting a whole DAG of TXes if an ancestor becomes invalid due to reorg.    matt.bit 🐢, [12/8/22 7:11 PM]  @bitcoincashautist fyi might have a simple way of doing expirin...

 We discussed this a bit on the last town hall

We're going to start having working group meetings, people who are interested should attend those meetings and begin contributing

yea i would say being active in the working groups, it's hard to tell if town hall is intended to be closed doors


[12/09/2022 12:06 AM] mattQuinn#0000
the meeting is shared publicly


[12/09/2022 12:07 AM] mattQuinn#0000
but in the interest of time it can't just be open dialogue


[12/09/2022 12:07 AM] mattQuinn#0000
given you were already in the slack it's probably fair to be a bit bold


[12/09/2022 12:07 AM] mattQuinn#0000

Hey everyone! 

Ergo Platform is throwing ErgoHack VI: Cypherpunk Finance. Plenty of great tools and dapps have came out of our ErgoHacks. 

"Cypherpunks advocate the widespread use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies and are encouraged to explore the realms of Web3, stablecoins, DeFi, and more."

Currently taking in registrations and the event is over a two week period starting on Feb 8 and ending on Feb 22.

We create a channel for the team within the Ergo Discord. There, participants can chat with mentors and find other possible teammates (if looking for additional members).

Hackathon participants will be free to pursue and build projects that span a variety of DeFi use cases. Utilizing DeFi’s composable building blocks, developers can enjoy the ability to tap into their creativity and build entirely new financial services. If you are looking for suggestions, our judges have prepared some suggestions for products that could be built on Ergo. However, there are no limits and participants are encouraged to submit ideas that explore their inspirations.

Prize Pool:
1st: 10K SigUSD & 150K ErgoPad
2nd: 6K SigUSD & 100K ErgoPad
3rd: 2K SigUSD & 50K ErgoPad

We'd love your participation and if you'd like: help us spread the event!

 Hey Matt. Not sure what you mean by this. Could you dumb down a bit for a layman? Are you referring to the utxo set snapshotting?

(re @NoahErgo : *Hey Matt. Not sure what you mean by this. Could you dumb down a bit for a layman? Are you referring to the utxo set snapshotting?*) 
 
 yep i think that would be it. I'm assuming they're in the block header?


[02/08/2023 5:24 PM] NoahErgo#0000
(re @mattQuinn : *yep i think that would be it. I'm assuming they're in the block header?*) 
 
 That is my understanding


[02/08/2023 5:25 PM] NoahErgo#0000
We can prune the UTXO set, blocks and headers on a protocol level. In the node, UTXO set pruning is supported and enabled when ergo.node.stateType = "digest", then your node does not store UTXO set but retains full-node security guarantees. It is also possible to prune blocks in this mode (ergo.node.blocksToKeep parameter). Then you can run a node with full node security and min storage (it still keeps all the headers).

Currently, we are working on bootstrapping with a UTXO set snapshot. This enables you to have a node with a UTXO set and full-blocks pruned, and then on bootstrapping with NiPoPoWs (then headers can be pruned in any mode)

This makes it possible to get a verified UTXO set snapshot without checking ~95% of the blockchain.

Then bootstrapping with NiPoPoWs will be done. Hopefully, in Q1 2023, we will see a release with UTXO set snapshots + NiPoPoWs bootstrapping, giving full node security with bootstrapping in ~30-60 mins on an ordinary laptop.

Most full nodes will provide snapshots. Security is theoretically the same as for a full node.

So I scanned on-chain data for AnyHedge contract settlements, this is DeFi volume on Bitcoin Cash blockchain! (cumulative & daily plots, y-axis is settled contract value in BCH)

We (Alephium) just published the 4th entry in our "Tech-promenade" series. The aim of the series is to find help elevate the public knowledge about Alephium and blockchain in general balancing articles for both technical and non-technical audiences.

This one will be of interest to anyone who's ever wondered what the "Sharding" part of Alephium is all about.

- finally the bridge is working smoothly under a lot of txns per minute on both side. 
- During the stress test we discovered a few race conditions and bottlenecks. Almost all of them are resolved currently.
- We'll let the bridge work under pressure for a few days.

- We almost minimized the use of Koios due to its bugs, latency, and being out-of-sync issues, and now we mostly use Ogmios. However, it is important for us to have multiple channels, so we'll keep it in the code for a while till a better option is available.
- first draft of tokenomics is ready and I'm working with a few experts to finalize it.

Non-custodian derivatives contracts are happening on Bitcoin Cash blockchain (made possible by '22 introspection opcode L1 upgrades), I made some scripts to scan on-chain data for contract settlements and got some stats. Public beta launched in November, since then:

TVL about 5000 BCH, cumulative settled volume 45000 BCH

- Stress test passed successfully. 
- Some malicious and rare cases (e.g. a guard running two instances/ actively going on and off to interrupt the bridge processes, committing to sign but not signing, etc) are under test and almost finished.
- tokenomics has a good progress.
- ready for public test launch. hopefully, in 2 weeks since the deployment will take some time for configuring a bunch of servers.

🧪 - Public Beta (test) Launch: it's pending a fix in sigma-rust but the process is already started. We'll be live soon.
- Put the system under a new stress test and checked the events status. Some new bugs found and fixed.
- Worked on standardizing of the test tools (especially jest in our case), discussing different best practices, conventions, etc.

🛡️ @rosen-bridge/ts-guard-service:
- Worked on finding the cause of invalidation of some events (when the events are not meant to get invalid).
- Worked on finding the cause of a wasm/prover error which causes our multi sig subsystem to time out. We are still working on it, as it's non-deterministic and cannot be reproduced easily.

🛠️ @rosen-bridge/utils:
- Introduced a new package inside our utils repository. The new package is meant to serve as a container for different functions and apis which are used inside other Rosen bridge packages.
- The first function we worked on was downloadRosenAssets. It can be used to programmatically download Rosen bridge assets (including tokenMap and all chains addresses files) instead of doing it manually. The function is mainly implemented to be used in our upcoming @rosen-bridge/cli package.

🧐 @rosen-bridge/watcher
- Re-tested our migrations in postgres and fixed some bugs.

⛓️ @rosen-chains/abstract-chain
- Every blockchain supported by guard-service in the bridge requires some actions which are defined in abstract classes and structures in this project.
- The classes are implemented. 
- The Development document which is a guide about how-to-add new chain is in progress.

🪙 Tokenomics
- Working on the improvements after receiving some comments from the experts.

Forwarded from cculianu: ^ I believe they have communicated with im_uname and they did send me a list of bugs -- all of them were ancient Core bugs from circa 2014.  None of them affect BCHN.

What happened is DOGE was basically dead as a project in terms of code updates for like 8 years -- until Elon Musk got a hard-on for DOGE back in 2021. And then the devs started updating DOGE again.

But the DOGE devs were very behind and they had a bunch of bugs and vulns. in the DOGE node software codebase .. ones that were fixed long ago even before BCH forked from BTC.

I do not believe BCHN is affected by these things at this time.

I did ping Halborn again today at their security disclosure mailbox just to be sure. But my two cents guess is most of the stuff that they found are DOGE-specific bugs that are inherited bugs from BTC from like 2013 or whatever, and lots of other chains out there are forks of Core from that era and haven't been maintained properly.


[03/14/2023 5:44 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
Forwarded from cculianu: i mean they sent me a list of bugs like 3 weeks ago.. and all of them were ancient core bugs that affect DOGE but dont' affect us.

but just to be sure I pinged them again just now. since maybe the two things are unrelated (or maybe they are not). Who knows.


[03/14/2023 5:44 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
Forwarded from cculianu: i think what is going on is most chains out there are not adequately maintained and Halliburton & Thor basically assume every altcoin is unmaintained or something. Lol. So they found bugs in DOGE, maybe affected LTC too.. and ASS-U-ME'd that everyone affected.

That's my pet theory.

And it's not like they are hardcore C++ guys can and/or have the time to test all 280 chains they support to see.. so they just cast a wide panic net.

Also a bit of a CYA move since if they had to shut off service, blaming others is always tempting.


[03/14/2023 5:46 PM] bitcoincashautist#0000
tl;dr ancient Bitcoin Core bugs, most active Bitcoin-tech chains fixed them, lots of abandonware coins didn't


[03/14/2023 9:25 PM] TechAdept#0000
Reasonable. I'm awaiting details from them as they claim RDD is in fact vulnerable in some way. Of course our production wallet version is based of 0.10 BTC, so that might not be surprising, but I'd think our latest based off 0.22 BTC should not be. Again, awaiting details and thought I'd share as a heads-up.

🧪 Public test: Now collecting the addresses of Ergonauts, test tokens will be sent and then we'll start the Ergonauts-only Public test this week. Next week, tokens will be distributed to public. 


🔎 @rosen-bridge/scanner
- Worked on fixing a typeorm error causing our ogmios scanner to get stuck at a random height. We observed that typeorm doesn't support parallel transactions for sqlite and monkey-patched our own version of typeorm.

⛓️ @rosen-chains
- Ergo chain is completely implemented according to abstract classes. Implementing unit tests are almost done.
- More update and improvements to abstract classes
- Worked on unifying of Cardano transactions received from different data sources.

⚖️ @rosen-bridge/minimum-fee
- Another config added to minimum-fee config box, representing fee ratio per transferring asset (guard service has yet to be updated to use this config)

🛎️  @rosen-api
- Added observation and event scanner to the project (With the support of postgrsql)
- Create transaction view and its corresponding API, to fetch Rosen transactions with various filtering parameters.
- Refactored tests due to RIP-001.

Forwarded from bitcoincashautist: I'm working on a little contract to mint some NFTs actually backed by something:

User pays face value BCH to the contract and gets a NFT keycard and a NFT vault token.
The keycard NFT is free to move, it can be traded, and it will have an artwork associated with it.
The vault NFT will contain the BCH and will be encumbered by a contract which will hold the BCH for a minimum holding period.
Upon expiry, holder of the keycard NFT can open the vault whenever he wishes to.
When a vault is opened both the keycard NFT and the vault NFT will be burned, and BCH released.
Each keycard NFT has an unique serial number as the NFT commitment.
The associated vault NFT has the matching negative serial number.

Summary of the video:
and we'll get back to you as soon as possible

-The UTXO alliance is a partnership between blockchains that use the UTXO model of accounting with the purpose of developing, improving and accelerating the capabilities of the UTXO model for everyone that uses it. 
-The goal with this alliance is to tackle three areas of development starting with problems like interoperability between ecosystems. 
-Each blockchain ecosystem will bring new innovation to the space by allowing users of the UTXO model systems the ability to transition easily between ecosystems. 
-The entire space becomes more decentralized and elevated beyond that is scaling. 
-Being able to scale transactions in a UTXO model is a challenge that all blockchains will

Hi, I'm Nathan. I was a founding member of the blockchain village as seen at DefCon. I volunteered there for years while I organized at the IoT village. Eventually, I became head organizer of the blockchain village

DefCon has decided not to welcome back the blockchain village. My resolve to strengthen the bond between  infosec and blockchain goes unwavered

I'm working with some hackers and organizers to deliver a first-of-its-kind crypto adjacent, infosec event

We record the promo videos next week in Las Vegas

To establish some credibility I'd like to mention a few folks here that would vouch for me

@LtayLormath @TechAdept @polycryptoblog 

There are nearly 400 of you here so I suspect I know more of you


[04/28/2023 1:32 AM] NathanHauk#0000
We're working on a new economy. This means developing applicable skill sets. There is a great deficit in blockchain proficient security consultancies

Moreso, many consultancies are dropping their blockchain verticals in favor of more stable, trustworthy, and legally favorable verticals such a aerospace, medical devices, IoT, and countless web apps

Crypto enthusiasts are veracious learners and are well primed for learning basic pen testing. They know what a nonce is, self custody, basic merkle tree, how to mint an nft, etc...


[04/28/2023 1:40 AM] NathanHauk#0000
Further, we've seen a lot of nation state level attack that are, IMO, both persistent and malicious in nature. We intend on sharing education that goes deeper into privacy than typical

We deliver hands-on workshops that inform and empower the atendee, leaving then confident in their new skills. We maintain small class sizes to assure that individuals get the help necessary to keep them from falling behind

While designing this event product we remained focused on what could be the most valuable social good for crypto. I believe this has the most positive impact in the decentralized sector


[04/28/2023 1:51 AM] NathanHauk#0000
I'd like support from utxo chains that see the value and want to help us deliver this product

This will require that I field a lot of questions. Before I do...

In Las Vegas we will record 1 day of talks and 1 day of workshops

We will edit that into a 
30-60 second sizzle reel
3-4 minute promo
9-12 minute montage of interviews, testimonials, extended highlights

-This video will proliferate among meetup organizers in the USA (for now)
-Organizers will claim their city on our discord
-When criterias are met they'll be added to a list of eligible cities
-From this list we'll deliver regional tours
- Then wrap it up with a national conference


[04/28/2023 2:01 AM] NathanHauk#0000
Every chain that donates approx 5k in donations/gifts will; 
-Have their logo prominently displayed in the videos
-Will have a chance to host a meetup in Vegas (one of our organizers runs the meetup
-Will be championed as proponent of independent security education and research

Thank you for your consideration. I'll be available to answer questions intermittently throughout the weekend

        Are you working on a utxo-focused project?


[04/28/2023 2:11 AM] NathanHauk#0000
No, I work very broadly for blockchain and for security. I'm very passionate about these 2 technologies. IMO blockchains are exploit tools and therefore a byproduct of security.

I want to make this truth more commonly understood with the intention of more chains quickly and safely competing to achieve freedom faster


[04/28/2023 2:12 AM] NathanHauk#0000
I work for no chain, yet with many. I work for no consultancy or hacker group, yet with many

        This kind of solicitation isn't in line with the norms of the group here


[04/28/2023 2:21 AM] NathanHauk#0000
I understand. Thanks for hearing me out. Thanks for protecting the kind of messaging that goes through this channel.

        In discussing this event (or series) focused on general education rather than project promotion and with a strong aspect of security and protection for inexperienced users, we agreed we’d like to gather interested projects to be involved in whatever capacity might work. 

We’d thought as a point of both general interest, promoting education, this effort might draw support from some of the projects gathered here. Apologies if we guided @NathanHauk improperly, that’s on myself and @LtayLormath. ❤️
