This is correct, but also, difficulty algorithms (all of them) try to keep block time constant.


[05/31/2021 9:07 PM] Wolf9466#6211
They just vary in how good they are at it.

How it could be N fixed at 2143944600? If one multiply it by 31 byte, it would be roughly 66 gb of memory required for the table. Where am I wrong?


[06/01/2021 3:52 PM] nitram147#5106
You are highly probably simply not wrong.
4200000÷(30×24)÷365 = 15,981735159817


[06/01/2021 3:53 PM] nitram147#5106
Count of block / (blocks per hour * hours in day) / days in year


[06/01/2021 3:54 PM] nitram147#5106
It means that the size of 66GB as you calculated will be reached 16 years after the genesis block was mined.


[06/01/2021 3:54 PM] nitram147#5106
(That should be about 14 years from now)


[06/01/2021 3:55 PM] nitram147#5106
If you assume the moore law, nowadays have GPUs 25GB of memory, so 66GB shouldn't be a problem in 2035 🙂

[06/05/2021 10:06 PM] nosynq#1900
I don’t really think that such memory size will be available in gpu even in 15 years. It’s quite risky to rely on tech which is not yet exist. So strange approach for me.


[06/05/2021 10:49 PM] timoh#9775
amd just released professional card with 32GB vram and 48gb models exist... 66GB is farfetched but half of that possible... tech tends to get cheaper over time


[06/05/2021 11:36 PM] andee#4722
@nosynq soft fork a new limit, community vote, problem solved?

Maybe. IDK.


[06/06/2021 9:22 AM] andee#4722
I'm just thinking loud, 66GB in 14 years is a lot


[06/07/2021 4:09 PM] kushti#0978
Well, we didn't  have (and I still not have) anything smarter than hardcoded increase. Hard to say how hardware will adopt.


[06/07/2021 4:09 PM] kushti#0978
But as rules are defined, it somehow will.


[06/08/2021 5:55 AM] Kaven#6681
@kushti have you ever written anything about leaving PoS behind, so to speak


[06/08/2021 5:56 AM] Kaven#6681
or the specifics of the decision to make Ergo a PoW chain


[06/08/2021 5:59 AM] Kaven#6681
does it all boil down to the security problem when defi yield is greater than staking reward?


[06/08/2021 12:57 PM] kushti#0978
@Kaven not just, PoW is also about (fair) distribution, for PoS currency you need to make huge ICO for fair distribution. Also, PoW is about simpler security assumptions and protocols like NiPoPoWs.


[06/08/2021 3:47 PM] Kaven#6681
makes sense 🙂

https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/044.pdf

I've been reading this and trying to conceptualize what a decentralized "pool" would look like - this paper may already answer the question and I'm just not fully understanding it yet, but with block generation is there a way to verify that the puzzle solving happened using some identifying information?

The use-case (which doesn't appear to be unique, I just want to understand it) is that I want individual miners to attempt to mine blocks, but upon mining a block I want to verify those same miners send the rewards to a "pool" rather than themselves.  Therefore in order to join this pool you put up collateral the size of a block reward so a contract can then use that collateral to pay-out the pool if the miner decides to keep the reward rather than pay towards the "pool"


[06/11/2021 1:37 PM] danandbeard#3509
I believe the paper describes this type of system as a Type 1 non-outsourcable PoW scheme by making miners use a private key as part of the puzzle solution such that anyone else can verify the block was indeed solved using that unique identity (and thus the contract can spend the collateral if the miner doesn't send the pool reward to the pool address)


[06/11/2021 1:40 PM] danandbeard#3509
so the smart contract would effectively just hold some data identifying the pool participants and then the contract would also watch block generation to make sure any blocks mined by participants resulted in a corresponding "pool" payment


[06/16/2021 1:21 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647

[06/16/2021 1:22 PM] danandbeard#3509
I have, the most interesting paper is actually the ethereum smartpool paper


[06/16/2021 1:22 PM] danandbeard#3509
p2pool requires a sidechain which ideally could be avoided, but I need to learn more about state machines in ergo's sigma protocols


[06/16/2021 1:25 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Interesting. I'll give the above a read later. I find the idea interesting but feel it's not as efficient as a regular centralised pool, with the p2poool method. I setup a p2pool node for VTC to test it, but it's probably not something I would mine on myself, the rewards never seemed to add up for me.


[06/16/2021 1:26 PM] danandbeard#3509
presuming state machines in ergos sigma protocols aren't prohibitively expensive it really doesn't require many transitions


[06/16/2021 1:27 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I'd love to setup some kind of pool for ERG but am still in the learning phase. I've been playing about with some pool scripts/servers, and it's not too hard, but gets confusing when it's for coins not supported by default for me.


[06/16/2021 1:27 PM] danandbeard#3509
effectively you bundle up your shares and send them to the smart contract in large bundles - the contract validates only some subset meaning a contract spend to transition state could happen very infrequently and then the pool payout could be delayed by some 20 blocks or so such that if you bundle up your shares during that time period you'll get fair rewards


[06/16/2021 1:28 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I like the idea but would need to test it.


[06/16/2021 1:28 PM] danandbeard#3509
smartpool is conceptually quite simple, although implementation without stateful account models like in ETH is likely far more complex


[06/16/2021 1:29 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
The deal breaker for me with any decentralised pool solution is simply if we get what we should in the long run.


[06/16/2021 1:30 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I felt even after a long p2pool was giving me much less.. 20-30% less. Possibly extremely bad luck but I think not.


[06/16/2021 1:30 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
*long trial


[06/16/2021 1:31 PM] danandbeard#3509
interesting, losses that big are either crazy bad luck or perhaps someone was exploiting a flaw


[06/16/2021 1:36 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
The network was always getting stale shares and such, some people claimed it didn't matter too much as long as my node was not having loads.. but I setup this http://acidpool.xyz:9171/ and between four of us with quite a lot of hashrate, over 21 days we all got consistently lower amounts of coin than if we were to use a normal pool. One thing that might of made it worse, at the time there was one node that had hundreds of users and was producing loads more bad shares.. but other kept telling me it didn't matter as long as my node and miners were performing well, which they were. That overloaded node has vanished now, so I may try again at some point.

[06/16/2021 1:37 PM] danandbeard#3509
oh yeah huge stale shares can absolutely matter if they were divvying up rewards and counting stale shares


[06/16/2021 1:39 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
People who were advocating p2pool told me it didn't matter, but my results seems consistent. We felt like we were being punished for other people's poor setups/nodes/miners. while we had gone to the effort of putting the pool up on a fast fibre line, and all mining from a close location to it.


[06/16/2021 1:40 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
In an effort to improve this a p2pool list was made to direct people too, that orders the list by ping to the person viewing.


[06/16/2021 1:40 PM] danandbeard#3509
well that all depends on if stale shares counted towards prize distribution - it may not have mattered


[06/16/2021 1:41 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
That's my issue, I don't fully understand the inner workings of it so had to take people's word for it.


[06/16/2021 1:41 PM] danandbeard#3509
yeah, fair enough


[06/16/2021 1:42 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
It seemed like the busy node, one which was driving traffic to it for profit, was causing some issue on the network. Our guess was just hundreds of users with bad ping to the node etc..


[06/16/2021 1:43 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
We noticed some miners on that node were also just giving 100% rejected shares, so maybe a farm that has left something setup badly.


[06/16/2021 1:44 PM] danandbeard#3509
yeah I'm not terribly familiar with the economics behind pools - I somewhat understand the implementation


[06/16/2021 1:44 PM] danandbeard#3509
naively I would presume paying out for stale/rejected shares wouldn't happen


[06/16/2021 1:44 PM] danandbeard#3509
but there may be certain attack vectors introduced by not accepting some/all of those "bad" shares


[06/16/2021 1:45 PM] danandbeard#3509
definitely something I'll need to learn a lot more about before I ever market an ERG smartpool


[06/16/2021 1:46 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I'm still very much learning. I have a lot of similar website and tech experience but I'm slightly out of my comfort zone with pools. I do plan to have a public pool with some GPU mineable coins and XMR eventually though, so am just setting up pools locally and testing them with friends etc.. until I'm comfortable that I can handle any situation in production.


[06/16/2021 1:47 PM] danandbeard#3509
very cool, hopefully you'll be in a position to answer my questions when I get to that point


[06/16/2021 1:50 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
A big worry for me was security, but upon looking at some popular pool apps/scripts, a lot of them are very well equipped to deal with attacks of various kinds.


[06/16/2021 1:52 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I think keeping auto withdraws forced with a variable limit that doesn't go too high, and have the pool rewards pay to another address, keeping the wallet as slim as possible, should help it from becoming a huge target in the first place.


[06/16/2021 1:53 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I really don't like the idea of the wallet being sat on a rented server, but I guess there is no other option really.


[06/16/2021 1:55 PM] Nythain#6769

Goodnight.
I need help, I'm trying to create a pool, but I'm having some difficulties.

I think about creating a pool to mine with friends now, and it would be a test run to create an open pool in Brazil for ERGO miners.
Now, 3 friends and I have already mined together in a single wallet, we mining at Herominers.
The initial tests I'm doing here on a single machine, even IP running the StratumServer and the miner.
Mining is already enabled in my node settings.

[06/18/2021 5:02 AM] arokace#8057
When you're solo mining on your own node that's just how it is I'm pretty sure.  Any share submitted that is lower than the network difficulty isn't gonna net you a solution to get a block.  This is why it isn't recommended to solo mine unless you have a decent amount of hash, like personally I'd say at least 10 GH but probably more honestly.

NVMiner, not sure if that's been kept up-to-date with the times honestly.


[06/18/2021 5:05 AM] marcioglaser#3380
Tanks.
We hav 8.5 Gh/s, this hash power is for my personal computer. 
My final project is a pool to many miners, but i need tests and works fine first.


[06/18/2021 5:06 AM] arokace#8057
ah gotcha.  my b.  Thats awesome though, we can definitely use more pool (not sure if you are planning for it to be a public one though)


[06/18/2021 5:07 AM] marcioglaser#3380

[06/20/2021 12:56 PM] marcioglaser#3380
you could have created #pool inside - Development -.  Where it was created in - Mining - the conversation has already become unproductive, with silly complaints that are already dealt with in other conversations.  Now I saw a huge discussion about a 76 mh guy complaining about the pool calculator.  And our attempt to create a new pool is getting lost in the middle of irrelevant issues.  If it's possible to put #pool inside - Development - that would be great.  (or building pool, creating pool, etc.)


[06/21/2021 3:51 AM] marcioglaser#3380
Friends, Sam recommended me not to use NB Miner in the pool tests here for now (pool I'm trying to create), because there are some issues. I just thought that today my 7.5 GHs are mining solo on Herominers and all workers are running NB Miner. Could this affect my block found?


[06/21/2021 11:04 AM] nitram147#5106
How many GPUs do you have - just out of my curiosity, 7.5GHs sounds like a lot.


[06/21/2021 1:15 PM] marcioglaser#3380
It's me plus 3 friends together.
I have 17 GPUs. (2.2 GH/s)
Friend 1 + (1.6 GH/s)
Friend 2 + (2.85 GH/s)
Friend 3+ (880 MH/s)

Total 7.53 GH/s


[06/21/2021 1:31 PM] nitram147#5106
Phuuuh, that's a lot. 17 GPUs, so you are probably not a "hobby" miner 😄 What's the electricity cost where you live? In my home country it's like 0.2€/kWh, so everytime it's better to just buy crypto than to mine it.


[06/21/2021 5:20 PM] marcioglaser#3380
Here it is too expensive, Brazil is too bad for that.

My energy bill is around R$2,500.00 which would be about $500 but mining is still profitable enough to make good profits. My GPUs are all new and most are RTX 3070 which is very efficient. Among them 3080s and some 1660s but they are equally efficient.

[06/21/2021 6:21 PM] marcioglaser#3380
Good to know there's one more in this project. Join me at #pool right here.
I just got promising results here, in fact mining in my pool, more than 500 shares accepted. But only with NV_Miner (open source). It works as expected, and sets the diff as configured in the pool. At Nanominer and NB Miner there was no satisfactory result. The diff does not decrease.

[06/26/2021 11:09 PM] Licklobster#5542
Fork difficulty to update at 256 or 512 blocks, instead of the current 1024. The long difficulty update time opens windows to abuse, which we're already starting to see with nicehash power on the network.


[06/27/2021 2:44 AM] arokace#8057
This has been a concern of mine too.  But as for NH doing anything yet, not sure what you're talking about.  I don't see anything odd going on yet.

Block time presently at 3mins because the alg cant correct itself quickly enough. lol... this needs to happen.


[07/03/2021 10:37 PM] pragmaxim#0778
I'd like to hear your opinions regarding block size as currently there is a lot of blocks with just a coinbase tx. This is caused by node generating a block candidate from (often empty) mempool immediately after a new block is applied. The reason is that miners are polling for new block candidate in a tight loop so the node generates new candidate asap for them. In fact it does so by itself as miner would grab it asap anyway.
 - One solution to this might be to generate block candidates one after another (the later ones would have smaller chance of being empty) however question is what is the probability of miners grabbing the first, empty candidate or the following candidates. It still might reduce amount of empty blocks though.


[07/05/2021 4:55 AM] Wolf9466#6211
Changing work takes time, and we don't like wasting time.


[07/05/2021 4:56 AM] Wolf9466#6211
My solution would be the node keeping track of candidate transactions in the mempool, and puts them in all blocks generated


[07/06/2021 12:41 PM] pragmaxim#0778
each candidate for the same Height would have all TXs from the mempool, imagine we would be generating candidates every 20 seconds, the first one would be most likely empty and ideally not grabbed by miners ... it is still better than now when we generate just one candidate for the same Height right after previous block was applied ... that leads to many transactions being included into the next block


[07/07/2021 2:48 AM] Wolf9466#6211
yeah, true


[07/12/2021 8:36 PM] Darkdemon#1648
What about having the difficulty update every 512 blocks and let the difficulty be determined based on the last 16 blocks


[07/12/2021 8:36 PM] Darkdemon#1648
Instead of 8


[07/16/2021 9:01 AM] pragmaxim#0778
@kushti ^^^ I'm thinking we could grab last xx blocks from history, average the block mining time and number of transactions and make the candidate generation proportional to these averages, with reasonable defaults/boundaries ... this way it would be adaptive to the network throughput, difficulty, etc.


[07/17/2021 9:30 PM] pragmaxim#0778
count of block candidates for given height is important as miner immediately stops mining current block candidate if new one is available ... so in order to not waste miners time, we should generate just 2 block candidates for given height: one right after height changes (to avoid mining obsolete block candidate), timing of the second candidate generation would be driven by avg count of TXs in past xx blocks and average mining time ... ie. let's make a candidate that contains avg count of txs => this way TXs would be evenly distributed within blocks

just curious, why not?


[07/31/2021 11:12 PM] ProSavage#7131
Wolf's belief that people who run mining pools should actually care and know how it actually works.


[07/31/2021 11:13 PM] ProSavage#7131
I think its possible to give still, but would like need a lot of documentation on the specifics


[07/31/2021 11:13 PM] ProSavage#7131
like a damn crashcourse on the whole system and how it even works


[08/01/2021 6:29 AM] Canberry#7404
man this really do be where I can see closed source being a good thing


[08/01/2021 6:59 AM] ProSavage#7131
mine with ur FPGA on my pool wen ready :kekw:


[08/01/2021 2:31 PM] Nythain#6769
There are people who care and are fully capable of understanding how things work without the talent/time to crreate from scratch. I am on the fence with you opening up your pool, on one hand it could lead to some less qualified pool operators (though i believe the understanding and administration would be enough to turn away most of them), but on the other hand it could lead to more quality pools and exposure. Also a great learning tool for those just interested in the whole shebang.


[08/01/2021 2:32 PM] Nythain#6769
Maybe make one part of it crazy hard to implement, sort of a test/gate lol


[08/01/2021 3:03 PM] ProSavage#7131
yeah I think the OP strategy is to provide literally all the info in a single guide


[08/01/2021 3:03 PM] ProSavage#7131
like I had to wireshark miners to figure out how they work for some parts of protocol


[08/01/2021 3:03 PM] ProSavage#7131
So basically I can provide all the info you need, now u just write the code


[08/01/2021 4:43 PM] Nythain#6769
Thats a good idea actually. Way to contribute without blowing up the ecosystem lol.


[08/01/2021 4:51 PM] Wolf9466#6211

[08/08/2021 11:54 PM] Marty#4039
Do you plan to share that data at some point? I'd be interested to see what you found


[08/09/2021 6:41 PM] andee#4722
just connect with the different miners to a pool and use wireshark to capture the traffic

i got a question bout this, can anybody help me? most of the pools have fees of 1.0%-0.9%, is really recommended to have an own node? i mean cost-benefit


[08/16/2021 10:38 PM] Serotonina#2676
or its better to continue mining on a public pool, anyone here got an own node for mining?


[08/17/2021 2:33 AM] BuzzLiteBeer#8676
If you are patient your own node will be cheaper than a pool over the course of a year of mining.


[08/17/2021 4:24 PM] Serotonina#2676
how much RAM is the minium required to get the node working with no problems, and how many MBs/GBs it takes in the hard drive?


[08/17/2021 4:32 PM] BuzzLiteBeer#8676
8gb min ram. Im not sure on space requirements.


[08/17/2021 4:35 PM] Serotonina#2676
wow, thx ill keep it in mind, if i run it on a PC with 4 GB of RAM u think will be problems? i already tried it, in a VM with 2 GB of RAM too, but just to make a few tests, not to have a stable running node


[08/17/2021 4:36 PM] BuzzLiteBeer#8676
no it wont be stable. i tried and it crashed.

what do you mean by "making the memory accesses in Autolykos2 wider." ?

@kushti I would harbor a guess to resolve issues like this

[08/21/2021 11:37 PM] Wolf9466#6211
correct


[08/23/2021 5:46 PM] Nythain#6769
only really affects navi and big navi... not sure how increasing the chunk size would impact every other card if at all


[08/25/2021 2:50 AM] shinaolord#6633
I would think it'd make vegas EVEN faster, since there's no wasted bandwidth then?


[08/25/2021 2:50 AM] shinaolord#6633
Or is having double not affect performance, only >2x?


[08/25/2021 7:20 PM] Wolf9466#6211
It'd make the memory turnaround faster, yeah - if we read more at a time


[08/30/2021 8:04 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Anyone know why ERGO went from AKv1 to AKv2 and allowed pools? Was it to help include smaller miners get something from POW?


[08/30/2021 8:05 PM] andee#4722
to get better decentralization


[08/30/2021 8:06 PM] HelixEvo#2120
But your giving central power to big pools now though right?


[08/30/2021 8:06 PM] andee#4722
as long as the number of pools keeps increasing and people spread out I see no problem with that. there is also #🧠│smartpools in the works

Wow, that sounds like a great solution.. So people still get rewarded for their work load, but its also decentralised, no pool custody and possibly will improve block times.


[08/30/2021 9:44 PM] glasgowm#9381
couldnt they implement non-outsourceability since no smart contracts?


[08/30/2021 9:57 PM] andee#4722
the advantage of this approach is that you will get regular rewards just like at a pool but without any centralization and zero fees


[09/04/2021 7:42 PM] bbot#6878
Do the ergo developers care about energy efficiency when it comes to designing autolykos? Is there any way of implementing functionality that incorporates it?


[09/04/2021 7:43 PM] bbot#6878
Seems like a lot of people seem to bash bitcoin and ethereum due to their high energy usage. Curious to know how PoW can combat that stigma of using tons of electricity


[09/04/2021 8:47 PM] andee#4722
in the end transaction throughput will be what determines this. bitcoin gets bashed because it uses a ton of electricity for ~5TPS


[09/05/2021 3:10 AM] Wolf9466#6211
You can't make an "efficient" algorithm without doing something dumb, like making it slow. An efficient algorithm actually means it's well-implemented, and that will use more power.


[09/05/2021 3:10 AM] Wolf9466#6211
The reason is, you're not just doing x amount of hashes and then you're done. You want to do as many as possible, as fast as possible.


[09/05/2021 3:31 AM] bbot#6878
Are you able to block older/less inefficient cards by doing something like increasing the minimum memory size?


[09/05/2021 3:32 AM] Wolf9466#6211
PoW is always going to use massive amounts of energy, it's inherent in the design. You could increase the min needed memory size, but that doesn't stop less efficient cards, just cheaper ones.

I got an opinion on Autolykos2 from a career ASIC dev. He's really good.
```
Wolf9466 — Today at 7:54 PM
Hey, I want your opinion on something.
[7:54 PM]
Switch to ASIC mode for a second
[7:54 PM]
If you were implementing this on a decently modern process, would you say it'd be reasonable to generate the indices (that is, do 64 Blake compresses) on-the-fly?
[7:55 PM]
To me, it's balancing on the edge of "fuck it, we can do it on the fly" were I making an ASIC, but you know far more than I.

*censored* — Today at 7:56 PM
my gut says "yeah do it on the fly" just cuz the FPGA's HBM is not that different from what you'd get on an ASIC, while ASIC gates are 10X better than FPGA.

Wolf9466 — Today at 7:56 PM
I was feeling the same.

*censored* — Today at 7:58 PM
but it would also be interesting to think of other weird approaches to the memory problem.  Like doing a lot of 16-bit wide DDR4 chips.  Such a narrow channel would be good at 32B random reads, and DDR4 is so cheap you could put 64GB and have 32 copies of the table in there, so you could keep flipping between banks like crazy
```


[09/08/2021 3:45 PM] kushti#0978
@Wolf9466 so, in short, efficient ASIC is possible ?


[09/08/2021 3:46 PM] Wolf9466#6211
Oh, certainly. I thought that was sort of the point.


[09/08/2021 3:46 PM] Wolf9466#6211
For ASIC to eventually show up


[09/08/2021 4:02 PM] kushti#0978
ETH has ASICs also, but still GPUs are mining. What can be for ERG ?


[09/08/2021 4:12 PM] andee#4722
@Wolf9466 do you have any thoughts about how efficient an autolykos miner could be? I think the most efficient ethash miner is around 1MH per 1.25W


[09/08/2021 4:13 PM] Wolf9466#6211
I'm not certain on how much extra area it'd take up


[09/08/2021 4:13 PM] Wolf9466#6211
BUT


[09/08/2021 4:13 PM] Wolf9466#6211
It's like this:


[09/08/2021 4:13 PM] Wolf9466#6211
@andee Ethash perf is so shitty because they HAVE to include RAM


[09/08/2021 4:13 PM] Wolf9466#6211
They are also bottlenecked by it.


[09/08/2021 4:14 PM] Wolf9466#6211
For an ASIC which does it on the fly, it could conceivably pump out one hash per cycle.


[09/08/2021 4:14 PM] Wolf9466#6211
Then it becomes a question of "how many cores of this can we fit on a chip"


[09/08/2021 4:32 PM] Wolf9466#6211
This also neatly sidesteps the issue of needing more memory - as it wouldn't use memory in the first place.


[09/08/2021 6:07 PM] morphic#4133
Hi, you mean recomputing the hashes may be more power efficient than accessing them in memory?


[09/08/2021 6:07 PM] Wolf9466#6211
Of course.


[09/08/2021 6:08 PM] Wolf9466#6211
I mean, it's only 64 Blake compresses, and since we're pipelining it, we have many hashes being computed in parallel.

{Reactions}
👍 

[09/08/2021 6:08 PM] Wolf9466#6211
My Blake2B for hardware, for example, is 48 stages - so there's 48 hashes in the pipeline.


[09/08/2021 6:15 PM] morphic#4133
So, you can feed in a series of random data blocks (one per cycle) to the input of the pipeline and after 48 cycles you can get one hash per cycle on the output?


[09/08/2021 9:50 PM] Wolf9466#6211
Yup.


[09/08/2021 9:50 PM] Wolf9466#6211
I break it into quarter-rounds for timing.


[09/09/2021 10:18 AM] morphic#4133
@Wolf9466 Interesting. So, once it is possible technically, it is just a matter of time and profitability of the additional spendings to produce ASICs. At some point we might see ASICs for Ergo.


[09/09/2021 4:03 PM] SolReaper#7892
why Ergo markets itself as asic resistant then?


[09/09/2021 4:24 PM] Wolf9466#6211
They did not know.


[09/09/2021 4:53 PM] morphic#4133
It yet to be proven that the ASIC design (like the above) is economically profitable in a long term (i.e. not only for the first adopters). You often can trade storage for computation, but at what cost? If the power advantage of recomputation is not high enough, then ASICs may be unprofitable (while possible).


[09/09/2021 11:25 PM] Wolf9466#6211
It's definitely high enough. Blake is rather small in hardware. Sixty-four instantiations, if it was 16, for example, you could fit that on FPGA


[09/09/2021 11:26 PM] Wolf9466#6211
So 4x the amount is *no* issue for ASIC.


[09/09/2021 11:26 PM] Wolf9466#6211
This TMTO is valid, just only on ASIC hardware.


[09/13/2021 3:53 AM] Wolf9466#6211
ETH doesn't have this TMTO, by the way


[09/15/2021 7:44 PM] AggerGakker#4449
Have there been any proposals the increase the speed of difficulty adjustments ?


[09/15/2021 7:45 PM] AggerGakker#4449
For example now we are running the chain with 140s blocktimes even though hashrate has dropped again


[09/15/2021 7:45 PM] AggerGakker#4449

[09/16/2021 10:38 AM] glasgowm#9381
I'm not really sure that's something you can calculate. Up I'd guess.

Hello all.  Im attempting to implement Autolykos solution verification and Im in the process of testing my implementation.   I was wondering if it would be viable to use the ergo explorer to test? - I.e. is it possible to obtain a passing: message, nonce, boundary, and height from the Ergo explorer?  In particular, what fields would be the message and the boundary?

If hashrate continues to drop, maybe we'll never have a difficulty adjustment.  Ergo is too new and volatile for its current difficulty adjustment mechanism.   It causes a positive feedback loop within each epoch.  Positive feedback loops, in which a change in a given direction causes additional change in the same direction.

[09/28/2021 11:07 AM] glasgowm#9381
no need to spam across channels. 

Here's your original comment - more via search

```
Please revisit Ergo's difficulty adjustment mechanism.  It unintentionally encourages pool hopping to the point that it can cripple Ergo.  High difficulty & low hashrate = increased block times = delay in difficulty adjustment = feedback loop that pushes more miners out increasing divergence between difficulty and hashrate further delaying difficulty adjustment.  My confidence in Ergo is waning specifically because of the difficulty adjustment mechanism.  Makes me wonder what else was overlooked.  Please do not ignore this!!  Thanks for listening.

After reading a little more about it, I understand the reasoning behind how ergo adjusts difficulty,  but there has to be a better way to balance usability and security.  Perhaps by introducing some "circuit breakers" when pre-determined conditions are met, it triggers the "circuit breaker" that readjusts difficulty earlier than typical

There's a few suggestions in here and throughout if you search. The issue is that it would require a HF and it's not clear (to me at least) if the pros outweight the cons.

"Hardforking policy
Ergo is trying to avoid hard-forks. Emission, proof-of-work, basics of transactional model and other core things should not be changed at all as any change about core parts of design means another chain. However, developers may propose hard-forks within first 12 months if (and only if):

a hard-fork is about security fixes only. The only exception is about making cost of particular instructions adjustable via miners voting, which was planned but not delivered in the current mainnet.
a hard-fork is supported by 90+% of miners.
a hard-fork is not breaking old contracts, freezing or moving any funds."


“In the old generation of POW, hard forks usually lead to community splits. In Ergo, miners can change parameters on the fly in their configs and 50%+ of blocks mined within 1024 blocks epoch need to be for raising/lowering the limit of some parameter, then it will be changed by 1% in next epoch. It can be block size, computational cost, storage fee factor and many more. Above comment for the old generation doesn't mention that core developers are 3rd party also. With Ergo`s design, when all basic assumptions are correct, network should adapt in time to changing environment without the intervention of any trusted parties.” - mx

Pinned a message.


[09/28/2021 5:34 PM] VertErgo#5544
Right, this would not necessarily be a security issue, as security is currently higher than needed. Though, it is definitely a usability and viability issue, as being stuck at a high difficulty for prolonged times will drive up block wait times to the point that the blockchain may no longer be usable.  If there is a hard fork in the future, this issue should be included for resolution.


[09/28/2021 5:37 PM] VertErgo#5544
The only positive I see in the current state is that it increases ERG scarcity which may help increase the price to the point this problem resolves itself.  So, one can see these circumstances (high difficulty - low hashrate) as a buying opportunity!! Positive spin... 😀

{Reactions}
😆 

[09/28/2021 5:44 PM] glasgowm#9381
well, diff drop in 30 anyway. 

The positive in its current state is that it'll be useful later on - and whether 1 or 2 HFs to remove and re-add it would be better than a few days of slow-blocks when we're small.


[09/28/2021 7:55 PM] glasgowm#9381
```I would like to point out that, there are mathematical way of preventing a feedback loop with delays, that would only kick in if such a loop was observed.

the current issue is not a feedback loop, it is a delay in reaction time of the DA to an extent it is protecting the network at the expense of the individual miner/farmer.

at least it is not as bad as BTC with a 2 week adjustment, but an epoch should be shorter than it is. This would still prevent a feedback loop. A loop is inevitable, like rolling hills, until the network is much larger, but the length of those hills should be shortened until then.```


[09/28/2021 10:36 PM] VertErgo#5544
I was expecting a bigger drop 😕  This is going to exacerbate the problem, those holding out for the difficulty adjustment will start hopping away.

"Later on" you are just assuming that ERG will get BIG one day, right? But this problem right now is for real, its affecting the network. Its bothering miners. And this is happening for 2-3 months already. Please, consider a fix for this. Miners are crucial for the project success.


[09/30/2021 11:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ergo lost more than 50% of its hashpower in less than 4 days. We are sitting at just 18TH/s now. IDK, the situation is just not looking good.


[09/30/2021 11:39 PM] Supreme_Destroyer#5046
Indeed. I agree with that. Devs are assuming there will be a "later on". The issue is real, it's happening right now. Small miners are being punished really hard by it.


[09/30/2021 11:39 PM] Supreme_Destroyer#5046
When diff drops enough, whales will jump back in for sure and eat most of the epoch


[09/30/2021 11:40 PM] Supreme_Destroyer#5046
Then small miners will be asked to eat the cost of holding the network with high difficulty


[09/30/2021 11:42 PM] Supreme_Destroyer#5046
Right now, the algorithm claims decentralization, but the profits are concentrated in the farms that  jump in every week out of four

Thats it.


[09/30/2021 11:51 PM] glasgowm#9381
What farms? The # of miners has reduced about as much too


[09/30/2021 11:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Actually, it didn't about as much. It was about 50k and now its 38k. Less than 25%. And we lost about 50% hash.


[09/30/2021 11:54 PM] Supreme_Destroyer#5046
Just look at the difficulty and hashrate graphs and you will find them


[09/30/2021 11:55 PM] glasgowm#9381
See HF policy above - if you can get pools/90%+ of miners to agree then it's up to the community to shape it. Devs don't think this issue warrants a HF afaik - vote with your hash and leave. Why do the farms have an advantage here?


[09/30/2021 11:55 PM] Supreme_Destroyer#5046
Between 15 and 26 of September. Low difficulty, hashrate goes up, high difficulty, hash down, repeat


[09/30/2021 11:55 PM] glasgowm#9381
I seen it pretty close to 60, so not far off


[09/30/2021 11:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
What is close to 60?


[09/30/2021 11:56 PM] glasgowm#9381
the price also peaked


[09/30/2021 11:56 PM] glasgowm#9381
nr of miners was at 57k something


[09/30/2021 11:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
No, I considering the same window... It was about 51k when the hash was 45 Th/s


[09/30/2021 11:57 PM] Supreme_Destroyer#5046
Don't worry, people will. Difficulty graph looks like a sine function and devs don't see anything wrong with it? That's bad


[09/30/2021 11:59 PM] glasgowm#9381
the price went 18>12>16>10


[09/30/2021 11:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
so its up to US, small miners, do that? Not the devs, the foundation or whatever? Ur seeing a lot of ppl here and on reddit complaining, but do we have the "power" to do that? Maybe this is your duty, not?


[10/01/2021 12:00 AM] glasgowm#9381
Nope I don't know much about mining. Would be the pool operators I guess and any prominent miners


[10/01/2021 12:00 AM] Supreme_Destroyer#5046
I hope you're right, and I hope we won't see it happening again in the following days with the price (kinda) low


[10/01/2021 12:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
What's kushti opinion on this? Disregarding the HF issue.


[10/01/2021 12:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
Did you guys, that works directly with the project... did you agree that we have a problem, right? And that's a serious one. Imagine a spike on the network usage when a new dApp is released, while this situation persists... IDK, can the network handle that?


[10/01/2021 12:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
I mean, Autolykos is great, its the best. But this diff system is killing us right now. Its seems to even affect transfers between wallets


[10/01/2021 12:06 AM] glasgowm#9381
Not particularly, as this shouldn't happen with a steady hash which should probably come pretty soon with an influx of miners. Network would be a bit congested but fine.


[10/01/2021 12:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
Well, unless you guys are preparing something that we are not expecting at all, it seems we are not getting a steady hash anytime soon.


[10/01/2021 12:12 AM] VertErgo#5544
This can be a nightmare scenario... if hashrate keeps dropping, we'll never get out of this epoch.  Only thing that can fix this in the short-term is a large  price increase.


[10/01/2021 12:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
Anyway, thanks for your attention and patience Glasgow. I don't know if the big guys up there are aware of the issue, they are probably busy, as always. But maybe this issue needs a closer look from them.


[10/01/2021 12:15 AM] VertErgo#5544
I just put my my miners back on Ergo... hopefully I can help a little

State your reasoning?


[10/01/2021 12:16 AM] VertErgo#5544
Thanks Glasgow!  I believe in Ergo, that's why I'm vocal.  Want it to succeed


[10/01/2021 12:17 AM] glasgowm#9381
Not much else to mine, lotta spare hash

[10/01/2021 12:20 AM] Supreme_Destroyer#5046
So just gotta be hopeful that ergo is going to be good enough when no other options are available?

Why not grow now?


[10/01/2021 12:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
ETH will likely be still mineable for months. Ppl on their community don't believe that the final transiction will occur before 2022 Q2 or Q3, maybe even Q4.

[10/01/2021 6:39 AM] Wolf9466#6211
@Canberry The current diff adjustment algorithm is very much not suitable for the current situation, causing long periods of unintended high difficulty and long block times, and also reducing profitability for miners.

Any benefit of creating ergo node


[10/08/2021 6:55 AM] gnuion#3794
Hello guys! Came across this project, and I find the idea of multiple mining algorithms interesting! Also the idea of solo mining without having to set up a node is interesting! And maybe there is a way to implement a smart contract between miners so they can have continuous  rewards. Like a decentralized pool... We usually use smart contracts to eliminate 3rd parties. Isn't a mining pool a 3rd party we can eliminate?

I have question pertaining to the difficulty/ block time thing.
In a situation where there's a big influx of hashpower and the block time decreases significantly.
Does that theoretically mean that transactions are settled quicker?

yes.

💯 

[11/04/2021 6:13 AM] Dv#3650
Why?


[11/04/2021 6:14 AM] Dv#3650
seems like it'd be the best way to assure the most blocks are completed at the correct block time


[11/04/2021 6:14 AM] Wolf9466#6211
because you want an AVERAGE, so that the block time tends toward the target based on difficulty


[11/04/2021 6:14 AM] Wolf9466#6211
Changing it every hour also allows for attacks


[11/04/2021 6:14 AM] Dv#3650
yes, but with ergo I've noticed a huge lag when difficulty drops and or raises


[11/04/2021 6:14 AM] Wolf9466#6211
YES, and this is a major issue


[11/04/2021 6:15 AM] Wolf9466#6211
Which, IMO, the diff adjustment period should be less - but an hour would be too small.


[11/04/2021 6:25 AM] Dv#3650
well, it seems like it's small right now compared to something like btc as least

[11/04/2021 10:00 AM] StonedPenguin#3483
I believe an 8-10 hour diff adjust could potentially work


[11/04/2021 10:47 AM] FlyingPig#2854
Rvncoin adjusts at every block. In an interview Tron stated that they originally had a few days lag but that miners jumping on and off affected the blocktime too much. Hence they did a hardfork to ensure consistent 2 minute blocks. The more use cases a Blockchain has the more I believe blocktime should be as predictable as possible so that end users know what to expect.


[11/04/2021 2:07 PM] AggerGakker#4449
with Nethash stabilizing it will be less of a problem


[11/04/2021 2:07 PM] Wolf9466#6211

I could be wrong but also Herominers pool being PROP (rather than PPLNS) and having a sizeable share of total hash also makes it easier for hashrate to jump on/off

[11/09/2021 11:34 AM] apexpool#3878
the electricity will be much more expensive than what you mine.


[11/09/2021 11:34 AM] AggerGakker#4449
Yup

cpu mining is over-run with botnets


[11/09/2021 1:08 PM] apexpool#3878
most of the people are securing the network without knowing it 😂


[11/10/2021 3:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
a lot more decentralized than bitcoin


[11/10/2021 4:24 AM] Wolf9466#6211
No, he's not saying that's bad. That's *good*. Botnets are indeed decentralized - unless you think one person/group owns ALL infected machines.


[11/10/2021 4:25 AM] Wolf9466#6211
They're securing the network just like anyone else - for the purposes of the coin, there's nothing wrong here.

hi dear devs !
i am BSOD, a new dev [ not yet ocntributed to the platform but yeah :blobgrimacing: ] and i am working on my very own crypto currency !
i would love to know how to implement autolykos algorithm into it as far as i have seen, [ being a miner myself ], autolykos is very gpu friendly !


[11/15/2021 2:24 AM] bsod#0067
please ping upon reply :SarahPray:

i wonder if ddr5 memory would help in cpu mining?


[12/10/2021 8:32 PM] liquid_phase#4605
If you want to utilize the autolykos algorithm at the same time as support the blockchain of those who developed it you could mint your crypto as a token on top of ergo blockchain and just go that route

[12/11/2021 4:51 PM] AggerGakker#4449
@Wolf9466 have you looked into the efficiency of the SRB cpu miner for autolykos?


[12/11/2021 6:39 PM] apexpool#3878
he does not need to. cpu mining ergo does not make sense.


[12/11/2021 6:39 PM] AggerGakker#4449
That's not what i asked


[12/11/2021 6:39 PM] AggerGakker#4449
I asked what the efficiency was


[12/11/2021 6:40 PM] AggerGakker#4449
I know it doesn't make sense


[12/11/2021 6:40 PM] AggerGakker#4449
I was just curious


[12/11/2021 6:41 PM] AggerGakker#4449
I heard that doctor mad some progress on second gen ryzen


[12/13/2021 3:44 PM] andee#4722
@AggerGakker I might check it out later, desktop is running r5 3600. its a little undervolted so I might lose some hash


[12/16/2021 4:06 PM] Asura#7863
cause the 3070 is overall a very efficient card


[01/06/2022 5:52 PM] digdug#5494
3070 is a swiss army knife. Not the best at any one algo, but pretty damn good across the board on all of them
