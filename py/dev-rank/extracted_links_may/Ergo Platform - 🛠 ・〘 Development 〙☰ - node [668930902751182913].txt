look like @Buccooooo experience some trouble during running the node over OSX. Please @Buccooooo copy-paste here the log of your node!

[05/31/2020 6:26 PM] gtklocker#2347
anyone runs the node from docker?


[05/31/2020 6:26 PM] gtklocker#2347
even though I have the v3.2.5 tag, app version shows as --SNAPSHOT


[05/31/2020 6:27 PM] gtklocker#2347
plus the node does not sync at all for some reason, even "genesisBlockId" shows as null


[05/31/2020 6:27 PM] gtklocker#2347
I use the --mainnet option and no config


[05/31/2020 6:29 PM] gtklocker#2347
my logs are full of messages like

@mehran is your docker node synced? how do you run it ?


[05/31/2020 10:42 PM] mehran#0528
> @mehran is your docker node synced? how do you run it ?
@kushti Actually my node is isolated (starts its own chain) for testing purposes. so I can't say if it has problem with syncing.


[05/31/2020 10:51 PM] kushti#0978
@mehran well, the problem is about readers staying in the state (None,None,None,None), which effectively means that database is not ready


[06/01/2020 9:10 AM] kushti#0978
@gtklocker gotcha, the problem is with folder permissions, see readme:

"This command also would store your data in /path/on/host/to/ergo/data on host system, and open ports 9030 (node communication) globally and 9053 (REST API) locally on host system. The /path/on/host/to/ergo/data directory must has 777 permissions or has owner/group numeric id equal to 9052 to be writable by container, as ergo user inside Docker image (please refer to Dockerfile)."


[06/01/2020 9:10 AM] kushti#0978
chmod 777 solves the problem


[06/01/2020 9:48 AM] gtklocker#2347
Classic case of rtfm, sorry about that


[06/01/2020 9:49 AM] gtklocker#2347
Will change and report back


[06/01/2020 9:50 AM] gtklocker#2347
I'm always expecting container to run with root user so this escaped me

@gtklocker seems you can‚Äôt get assets. Can you show me your network console?


[06/02/2020 2:28 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
@kushti it is not this case


[06/02/2020 2:29 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
I think I know what is this


[06/02/2020 2:30 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
I will try to fix it today


[06/02/2020 2:33 PM] gtklocker#2347
@Dmitry Usov the html page is returned for every path requested which is the problem


[06/02/2020 2:33 PM] gtklocker#2347
Console shows parsing errors as both css and js files are html and thus unparsable


[06/02/2020 2:33 PM] gtklocker#2347
I'll send a screenshot when I get on


[06/02/2020 2:34 PM] gtklocker#2347
But the weird thing is that this intermittently happens and it's not clear how to reproduce


[06/02/2020 2:34 PM] gtklocker#2347
If you look at the pastebin I posted you can see it doesn't only happen from the browser

yeah yeah right, so I understand now hy that is


[06/02/2020 3:57 PM] gtklocker#2347
/panel/ doesn't work but /panel does


[06/02/2020 3:57 PM] gtklocker#2347
reason is wrong base url

[06/02/2020 3:59 PM] gtklocker#2347
so similarly if I go to /panel/wallet and hard refresh it will not work


[06/02/2020 3:59 PM] gtklocker#2347
but if I go there after successfully visiting /panel it does work because assets are cached


[06/02/2020 4:31 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
yes!


[06/02/2020 4:32 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
because panel is SPA


[06/02/2020 4:40 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
@kushti maybe we can change this behavior. Need to change settings in server config to: if request looks like /panel/* redirect it to /panel/index.html


[06/02/2020 4:54 PM] kushti#0978
@Dmitry Usov which config ?

Hi


[06/12/2020 2:19 PM] cryptodeveloper#6924
I installed full node on Ubuntu 18 Server. I am trying to access the panel using the apiKeyHash value in the sample config output. But an error is generated when defining api key in the Panel.

@cryptodeveloper you try to set apiKeyHash but need apiKey


[06/12/2020 3:02 PM] Robert K#0722
Hmm, maybe the hash is wrong in the documentation there? I'd recommend using the installer script which sets the api key hash for you based on whatever you give and it definitely works: https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/blob/master/ergo-installer.sh

Do you have integration documentation for exchanges?


[06/12/2020 4:15 PM] kushti#0978
@Dmitry Usov I guess it is right that @cryptodeveloper provided "hello". @cryptodeveloper how do you run the node? Maybe config is not provided ?


[06/12/2020 4:21 PM] kushti#0978
@cryptodeveloper I tried this apiKeyHash value and "hello", panel unlocked successfully


[06/12/2020 4:32 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
Oh, I didn‚Äôt see panel screen. Sorry


[06/12/2020 6:16 PM] Robert K#0722
I think in more recent versions the node seems to timeout?
```{
  "error": 500,
  "reason": "internal.error",
  "detail": "Ask timed out on [Actor[akka://ergoref/user/$c#-1663303779]] after [5000 ms]. Message of type [org.ergoplatform.nodeView.ErgoReadersHolder$GetReaders$]. A typical reason for `AskTimeoutException` is that the recipient actor didn't send a reply."
}```


[06/12/2020 6:17 PM] Robert K#0722
I'm on 3.3.0 latest release, and the above is from swagger, but when I try via panel with "hello" as api key then it delays for a lot longer than previously when accepting/rejecting the api key and then says bad api key.


[06/12/2020 6:17 PM] Robert K#0722
I'm guessing it's just timing out and returning the default error message.


[06/12/2020 6:31 PM] kushti#0978
@Robert K is it during the sync ?


[06/12/2020 6:36 PM] kushti#0978
will take a look to 3.3.0


[06/12/2020 6:42 PM] Robert K#0722
@kush02 Yes during sync.

> @Dmitry Usov I guess it is right that @cryptodeveloper provided "hello". @cryptodeveloper how do you run the node? Maybe config is not provided ?
@kushti I was doing reverse proxy with nginx. The api_key header key was not transmitted. The problem stems from this

How can I calculate transaction fee with API?


[06/13/2020 9:58 PM] cryptodeveloper#6924
To create a new address, I request the address /wallet/deriveNextKey and get the address. I sent some ERG to this address. I want to create a transfer to another address. How do I create the hash in registers-> R4 in the example on the Swagger page?

Is there anyone who can help me?


[06/14/2020 2:43 PM] scalahub#2618
@cryptodeveloper do you have some value to put in R4?


[06/14/2020 2:44 PM] scalahub#2618
and what is the type? You need to get the hex encoded value of the object you want to put in R4.


[06/14/2020 7:36 PM] cryptodeveloper#6924
I don't know what's put on R4. Do I need to fill?


[06/14/2020 8:16 PM] cryptodeveloper#6924
How can I calculate transaction fee ?


[06/14/2020 8:18 PM] scalahub#2618
No you don't need to put anything in R4. In Ergo, R4...R9 are optional data registers where one can store data for smart contracts. Its not needed for ordinary use


[06/14/2020 8:19 PM] scalahub#2618
and the node calculates tx fee automatically (I believe) but for default, I would recommend 0.001 Ergs or 1000000 nanoergs


[06/14/2020 8:21 PM] scalahub#2618
similarly you don't need to put anything for tokens. leave it empty data


[06/14/2020 8:21 PM] scalahub#2618
(tokens = assets)


[06/14/2020 8:21 PM] cryptodeveloper#6924
Thank you @scalahub 
Finally, I want to ask this. Do I need to use the "'/wallet/transaction/generate'" endpoint to create a transfer?

Generate will not broadcast. You need `/wallet/transaction/send`


[06/14/2020 8:24 PM] scalahub#2618
if you did use generate, you can paste it output in `/transactions/` to send it

both are equivalent

Can I fetch information for unconfirmed transactions from my node?


[06/14/2020 8:42 PM] scalahub#2618
yes you should be able to see unconfirmed transactions on the node.. 1 min


[06/14/2020 8:42 PM] scalahub#2618
`/transactions/unconfirmed` what does it show?


[06/14/2020 8:42 PM] scalahub#2618
can you paste the output if your tx is there


[06/14/2020 8:44 PM] cryptodeveloper#6924
This is response of /transactions/unconfirmed

[06/14/2020 8:46 PM] scalahub#2618
can you please reissue the request and this time use `/wallet/payment/send` with the following JSON

[06/14/2020 8:47 PM] scalahub#2618
if your tx is not in unconfirmed then something is wrong

Ok. I will try


[06/14/2020 8:48 PM] scalahub#2618
I recall I had some issue with the other endpoint and the above worked


[06/14/2020 8:49 PM] scalahub#2618

Currently there is tx in the /transactions/unconfirmed output. But I couldn't open it in explorer.

Hah. Ok. Thank you so much. I will wait for confirm


[06/14/2020 8:55 PM] scalahub#2618
will have to check if any issue with the other endpoint or we missed the documentation.. In my opnion it should have worked


[06/14/2020 8:56 PM] scalahub#2618
probably it didn't include a fee and so the tx was not accepted in mempool

[06/18/2020 4:53 PM] Robert K#0722
A small improvement for the node wallet: I'd recommend linking to the explorer now that unconfirmed txs are shown, rather than just supplying the tx id to copy.


[06/19/2020 2:40 PM] kushti#0978

Also, if possible/you find time, could you please fix the `/panel/` problem @Dmitry Usov?


[06/19/2020 8:24 PM] Robert K#0722
It's pretty counterintuitive that `/panel` works but `/panel/` doesn't, and if you move to the wallet section which is `/panel/wallet` and refresh it simply doesn't load.

@kushti The timeout issue still remains


[06/22/2020 4:30 PM] Robert K#0722
```
{
  "error": 500,
  "reason": "internal.error",
  "detail": "Ask timed out on [Actor[akka://ergoref/user/$c#-1263173111]] after [5000 ms]. Message of type [org.ergoplatform.nodeView.ErgoReadersHolder$GetReaders$]. A typical reason for `AskTimeoutException` is that the recipient actor didn't send a reply."
}
```


[06/22/2020 4:32 PM] Robert K#0722
I also tried `3.2.3` and `3.2.7` which I had both on my system, and tried launching both from 0 to see if I could replicate the timeout and if it was related to syncing, however to no avail. The issue seems to be only on 3.3.0 (i942) and not on any of the current released versions.


[06/22/2020 4:33 PM] Robert K#0722
Actually, let me try compiling `3.2.7` to see maybe it's something with my system/compilation process? I checked the `3.2.x` branches with the precompiled .jar


[06/22/2020 4:39 PM] Robert K#0722
@kushti Ah, yes it seems to also have happened when I assembled `3.2.7` myself, so this is on my side apparantly


[06/22/2020 4:41 PM] Robert K#0722
Sorry for getting you to try and track down a timeout issue in the codebase. Not sure what is casuing the problem nonetheless though.


[06/22/2020 4:50 PM] Robert K#0722
Alright, so I changed my system from default using java-8 now to java-11, and the issue is solved. I didn't read the documentation carefully so my bad if that was a requirement in the first place (I just attempted to compile with whatever I had on my system, and since it compiled I assumed it was fine... üòÖ )


[06/22/2020 4:51 PM] kushti#0978
@Robert K that's weird as I'm doing releases with Java 8 )


[06/22/2020 4:51 PM] kushti#0978
Do you use Oracle's or OpenJDK ?


[06/22/2020 4:51 PM] Robert K#0722
open-jdk on Ubuntu 18.04


[06/22/2020 4:54 PM] kushti#0978
even more weird. btw maybe you had old 3.3.0 db ?


[06/22/2020 4:54 PM] kushti#0978
running newer code over it


[06/22/2020 4:55 PM] kushti#0978

[06/22/2020 4:58 PM] Robert K#0722

[06/22/2020 4:58 PM] Robert K#0722
For each.


[06/22/2020 8:15 PM] Robert K#0722
Using 3.3.0 I keep getting this error when trying to test `/wallet/transaction/generate`:
```

[06/22/2020 8:21 PM] Robert K#0722
It happens with the basic example from swagger, and if I strip it down to a single request too.

Please refer to the above for the schema. Also why is there fee in the payment request as well as the request holder?


[08/10/2020 2:15 PM] kushti#0978
@scalahub amount is dynamic actually, an algorithm is trying to pay as little as possible in regards with current parameters.minValuePerByte value


[08/10/2020 2:15 PM] kushti#0978
@scalahub fee is per all the request,lemme check schema desc


[08/10/2020 10:22 PM] scalahub#2618
ok amount dynamic is fine.. but putting fee twice is confusing.. (the use of fee inside the `AssetIssueRequest` and also outside)


[08/11/2020 1:17 PM] kushti#0978
@scalahub yes, will be fixed in 3.3.1, thanks for reporting@


[08/13/2020 3:39 PM] scalahub#2618
looks like node is using deterministic signatures? (which is good)


[08/13/2020 4:18 PM] kushti#0978
@scalahub you mean a form of EdDSA, in contrast with ECDSA? then yes


[08/13/2020 4:21 PM] scalahub#2618
I meant that multiple times calling the sign results in same txid


[08/17/2020 10:08 PM] scalahub#2618
In the panel when sending payment

```Your payment successfully sent. Your transaction ID - 977397ff5a04e2838968ec4b073f4bce9f1e89c5a831a3feff1679e514d91841

@anon_real yes, payment/send is using default fee, for a custom fee, /wallet/transaction/send is needed


[10/28/2020 5:06 PM] anon_real#2768
@kushti Is it doable to have support for getting unconfirmed boxes in the node? for example `/scan/unconfirmedBoxes/{scanId}` and also sth like `/utxo/byIdBinary/unconfirmed/{boxId}` in the future?

@kushti why calling `/scan/register` with:

    "value": "10010101d801d601d17300ea0272017201"

results in the following scan when calling `scan/listAll`?:
```{
    "scanId": 13,
    "scanName": "assembler",
    "trackingRule": {
      "predicate": "equals",

@Dmitry Usov what about having a table of assets in the Payment Send section, where you can add/remove rows, and edit amounts. Then many assets can be sent in a single transaction.

Is the key hash definitely the right one?


[02/15/2021 12:28 PM] yamilife#9036
@Icarus I had a similar problem yesterday and I had to delete my `history` folder and let it sync again. Not's working as expected


[02/15/2021 12:28 PM] yamilife#9036
But seems to be a code problem from what I could understand


[02/15/2021 12:36 PM] Icarus#4508
So I need to wait for full snyc befor putting in my secret?


[02/15/2021 12:36 PM] Icarus#4508
I have not deleted history for now. How long does full sync take?


[02/15/2021 12:37 PM] Icarus#4508
Its definetly the right key hash /secret. No issues here.


[02/15/2021 12:39 PM] Icarus#4508
Would I just have to delete anything in history and thats  it?


[02/15/2021 12:43 PM] yamilife#9036
I deleted mine and went to sleep, I woke 7h after and it was synced


[02/15/2021 1:56 PM] kushti#0978
is your node synced? i.e. on the same height with explorer


[02/15/2021 1:58 PM] kushti#0978
how do you run the node? Likely it is not able to read the config and then reading some default value from default config. Will be improved in 4.0.5 coming, so the node will fail if no API key provided directly


[02/15/2021 1:59 PM] Icarus#4508
I run via command box start. Just like in the blog post described


[02/15/2021 2:02 PM] jdoerrerstl1977#4308

[02/17/2021 8:12 PM] gtklocker#2347
going back to 4.0.4 for now


[02/17/2021 8:14 PM] gtklocker#2347
is this necessary? I've been able to use the node with no config until now


[02/18/2021 10:18 AM] kushti#0978
@gtklocker yes from now you need to set API key. With default value a lot of issues we had when custom config was not parsed properly and then a user had confusing "Bad API key" message


[02/18/2021 1:13 PM] gtklocker#2347
is there a sample config? In general I've tried to avoid using one as parameters set are sometimes consensus critical and could become outdated


[02/18/2021 1:13 PM] gtklocker#2347
can I have a config with just the api key in this case?


[02/18/2021 1:14 PM] gtklocker#2347
I remember some wiki pages in the past with configs but is there any reference for all the options?


[02/18/2021 1:21 PM] kushti#0978
@gtklocker simplest config would be 
scorex {

 restApi {    
    # Hex-encoded Blake2b256 hash of an API key. Should be 64-chars long Base16 string.
    apiKeyHash = "324dcf027dd4a30a932c441f365a25e86b173defa4b8e58948253471b81b72cf"
  }

  }


[02/18/2021 1:21 PM] kushti#0978
and then you API key is just "hello" (with no quotes)


[02/18/2021 3:32 PM] gtklocker#2347
thanks


[02/18/2021 3:32 PM] gtklocker#2347
I'm also noticing some problem with running this on docker: the node does not respect the docker stop signal (sigterm) and needs to be sigkilled


[02/18/2021 3:32 PM] gtklocker#2347
so it doesn't exit cleanly


[02/18/2021 3:34 PM] gtklocker#2347
is this reproducible also outside docker? perhaps it has something to do with the image


[02/18/2021 4:06 PM] gtklocker#2347

[02/18/2021 9:40 PM] glasgowm#9381
Nothing in the wallet so don't care about keeping it - is there an easy way to un-initialise the wallet?


[02/19/2021 9:17 AM] Dmitry Usov#0134

Ok, I'm having trouble getting the Ergo node configured on my Windows computer for a wallet

I've been following this video to set up the node

**How to set up and configure a full Ergo node on Windows
** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpEDJ1CM6ns

And following these instructions to set up the node
**How to set up and configure a full Ergo node**
https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Set-up-a-full-node
**How to set up and configure a full Ergo node**
https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_02_how_to_setup/

I've set up the files and the** ergo.conf** file just like the video did and not the github page

**ergo {
    directory = "C:/Ergo"
    node {
        mining = false
    }
    wallet.secretStorage.secretDir = "C:/Ergo"
}**


[02/19/2021 11:58 PM] Fourieristic Fr‡ªê‡∫á#6571
However when I run 
**  java -jar ergo-4.0.6.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf**
I get

I turned off windows Firewall and added the site as an exception in my browser
I removed Java SDK and reinstalled again but still getting problems, any idea on what to do?


[02/20/2021 12:23 AM] Fourieristic Fr‡ªê‡∫á#6571
Nvm, went back and downloaded 4.0.4 jar and zip file and used
  java -jar ergo-4.0.4.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf
in powershell instead. Problem was similar to gtlocker

Got it all set up and going


[02/20/2021 2:11 PM] gtklocker#2347
is it expected that the panel says Version --SNAPSHOT?


[02/20/2021 4:59 PM] gtklocker#2347
anyone else having issues with the pure java leveldb implementation on Mac?


[02/20/2021 5:14 PM] gtklocker#2347
ok so it turns out leveldb for linux & leveldb for mac are incompatible


[02/20/2021 5:15 PM] gtklocker#2347
and if you bring your linux leveldb to mac it will be corrupted irreversibly


[02/20/2021 5:15 PM] gtklocker#2347
and not work


[02/20/2021 8:33 PM] kushti#0978
@gtklocker yes, native leveldb had problems, so for Mac (as well as some other platforms, like Raspberry Pi), pure-Java alternative is used


[02/20/2021 8:34 PM] kushti#0978
@Fourieristic Fr‡ªê‡∫á 4.0.4 is not solving your problem. now you probably have "Bad API key" ? Problem is in config, likely directories need to be provided  in another format @mx do you have windows example ?

if you are going to add/delete a different section in config, use for example notepad++, otherwise your config will be broken with standard editing tools

Actually everything looks like its working tho I haven't sent anything to the wallet


[02/21/2021 3:06 PM] gtklocker#2347
are you aware that that they are incompatible?


[02/21/2021 7:45 PM] gtklocker#2347
and that using one on the other's db corrupts it?


[02/22/2021 11:01 AM] kushti#0978
@gtklocker yes, but the node is using only one of them


[02/22/2021 12:38 PM] gtklocker#2347
ok

although initial sync did finish ok now opening the node results in it crashing within a few minutes

Running from the version built from source maxed out at 17.5GB of ram o.o


[02/22/2021 3:54 PM] anon_real#2768
@glasgowm  think you should run it with ```--mainnet -c /etc/myergo.conf```


[02/22/2021 3:55 PM] anon_real#2768
@glasgowm If you like to use docker-compose then I use it with the following content:
```version: '3.8'

services:
  node:
      image: ergo:4.0.7
      restart: always
      ports:
        - 9053:9053
        - 9030:9030
      command: "--mainnet -c /etc/myergo.conf"
      volumes:
        - ./.ergo:/home/ergo/.ergo
        - ./ergo.conf:/etc/myergo.conf
      deploy:
        resources:
          limits:
            cpus: '0.4'
            memory: 1400M```
So basically copy this in docker-compose.yml and run ```docker-compose up -d``` to run it.
Node's data will be saved in .ergo directory which you have to create beforehand and change its group like this: ```chown -R 9052:9052 .ergo```
Also your config file must be in the same directory with name ergo.conf


[02/22/2021 3:56 PM] anon_real#2768
Also, what I have sent will limit the memory usage of node to 1400MB and cpu to 40%.


[02/22/2021 3:59 PM] glasgowm#9381
thank you üôÇ - I tried that but was missing the `-c`


[02/22/2021 4:20 PM] glasgowm#9381
I had to change to this to get it to work

        - 9053:9053
        - 9030:9030
      command: "--mainnet -c /etc/myergo.conf"
      volumes:
        - ./.ergo:/home/ergo/.ergo
        - ./ergo.conf:/etc/myergo.conf
      deploy:
        resources:

[02/28/2021 10:06 PM] kushti#0978
@desmo you can try /wallet/rescan in Swagger as a mean of last resort


[02/28/2021 10:06 PM] kushti#0978
not sure wallet can skip the block though


[02/28/2021 10:11 PM] kushti#0978
did you initialize the wallet / added address before this block ?


[02/28/2021 10:42 PM] desmo#5851
yes i did set up the node before i started to mine some ERG at herominers, with swagger i can read out the header id and the block info for 420214 so i guess the wallet has it? Wallet/rescan means the whole chain will be lost and i have to sync from zero?


[03/01/2021 2:26 PM] kushti#0978
no, the wallet will rescan the chain from genesis

hi all, I just started a full node on my linux server more or less just for fun, but I am somehow confused by the config files. seems like some documentation is outdated or I am missing something?!

There is a very basic config here:

https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Set-up-a-full-node

And then there seems to be a much more in depth config for mainnet here:

https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/blob/master/src/main/resources/mainnet.conf

Is the first one deprecated? Seems like using the mainnet.conf (plus adding my api key which isn't in the mainnet.conf example) works just fine

Guys I've realized that some of you are running nodes (on Windows , following some tutorial, I guess) with directory = "c:/ergo" and secretDir = "c:/ergo" , and then wallet is not initialized after restart.

The problem is that the node assumes that the secret dir contains only one file (encrypted seed). Likely you have many JSON files in the secretDir folder. 
4.0.8 will be permissive to multiple files in secretDir. For versions we have now, copy JSON file(any of them if you used the same mnemonic) to a dedicated secretDir containing one JSON file only!

[03/12/2021 12:24 AM] cymatic#8185
I'm about to set up a full node and then an oracle and have some questions:

1. Does node/oracle run better on Windows or Linux?

2. If Linux, any distro preferred?

3. Minimum system requirement for RAM?

4. Any reason a VPS would not work for this? (I will have root access)

5. Any reason to NOT run the oracle on the same VPS as the node?

6. Once configured, is the node and oracle "portable". For example, let's say after a month I want to get off the VPS onto my own box, can I "move" the node/oracle or when I reinstall on my own box will the node/oracle look like a completely different instance to the network?


[03/12/2021 8:24 AM] kushti#0978
@cymatic both Windows/ Linux are possible, VPS could work, 2+GB RAM recommended, run with -Xmx flag please, e.g. java -jar -Xmx3G to cap RAM consumption at 3G


[03/12/2021 10:23 PM] cymatic#8185
If you don't run it with the -Xmx flag, will it overutilize the RAM? I forgot to use the -Xmx flag and have been seeing the node crash unexpectedly after it runs for a while. It restarts fine but never stays running for more than an hour before it crashes again.


[03/12/2021 11:17 PM] kushti#0978
@cymatic the node is crashing on some platforms with no -Xmx flag due to aggressive consumption of RAM by Java virtual machine during bootstrapping.


[03/13/2021 12:15 AM] cymatic#8185
I restarted the node with the -Xmx1G switch but it doesn't seem to be honoring it. The RAM usage keeps climbing...you can see in the picture that it's currently up to 1.6GB. Does the -Xmx switch work for 1G value? Or just 3G? (e.g., only -Xmx3G)

[03/13/2021 1:53 AM] cymatic#8185
Well some good news...I was running my node on a VPS with 1GB RAM to see how cheaply I could get away with, but the node was continually crashing within an hour (memory usage would climb steadily until it maxed out the VPS). I tried using the -Xmx flag with -Xmx1G but this didn't help (as would be expected since there was only 1GB available on the VM). I tried setting the memory limit to 0.5GB with -Xmx0.5G but the command didn't like that (not surprising) so it wouldn't even start. So I increased my RAM on the VPS to 2GB and restarted the node with the -Xmx1G flag. This time it seemed to work and the node has been running stably for a couple of hours now. Memory usage for the java process did climb steadily above 1GB but it has stopped at a steady 1.6GB, so while that is more than the 1GB I requested with the -Xmx flag, it is leaving enough headroom for the VPS to continue to run smoothly.

I still hope to fire up the oracle that I built today on this VPS alongside the node, so not sure how that's going to go with the 2GB total RAM.

@Groyal Did you modify ergo.conf to include apiKeyHash after getting the hash for your secret from swagger?


[03/13/2021 3:54 AM] Groyal#3647
@Garlic yes! I pasted the new 64 digit code but I didnt use ‚Äòhello‚Äô as the secret, I used another word. does that matter?


[03/13/2021 4:02 AM] Garlic#0808
That sounds correct. 'hello' is just a placeholder used in the documentation and you should come up with your own secret and use the hash generated by the Blake2b util in swagger. You're using the "-c ergo.conf" flag and have the config file in the same directory as the .jar file correct?


[03/13/2021 4:05 AM] Groyal#3647
thats is correct!


[03/13/2021 4:25 AM] Groyal#3647
I can send you screenshots if you would like @Garlic Im just not sure what‚Äôs wrong, ive tried using 4.0.4 as well


[03/13/2021 5:59 AM] cymatic#8185
I figured out that to specify a max JVM heap size of 0.5GB, instead of using -Xmx0.5G you use -Xmx512m. That works, but the max RAM usage of the node still climbs all the way to 1.3GB before leveling off

Still, the node seems stable and is continuing the synchronization process (has been synchronizing for about 6 hours so far)


[03/13/2021 9:09 AM] kushti#0978
You need to leave to some RAM to the operating system ) 1GB for the node with 2GB overall sounds good


[03/13/2021 9:10 AM] kushti#0978
did you run the node with something like "java -jar -Xmx3G ergo-4.0.8.jar  --mainnet -c mainnet.conf" ? You need to specify config file explicitly


[03/13/2021 4:55 PM] Groyal#3647
@kushti yes I ran it with that, My conf is named ergo.conf


[03/13/2021 4:56 PM] Groyal#3647
@kushti also tried from scratch in another directory. its running but using default config. almost like its not recognizing the config file type


[03/15/2021 11:02 AM] kushti#0978
@Groyal windows? likely config is broken because of folder names. Please show me your config


[03/15/2021 1:01 PM] anon_real#2768
@Dmitry Usov is it possible to increase the default ERG value in the node's panel from 0.001 to 0.01 ERG for the next version?


[03/15/2021 1:01 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
why?


[03/15/2021 1:02 PM] anon_real#2768
default ERG value needed for redeeming SigRSV and SigUSD is 0.01 ERG.


[03/15/2021 1:03 PM] anon_real#2768
As well as auctioning tokens.


[03/15/2021 1:05 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
what will happen if I send 0.001 erg and sigusd?


[03/15/2021 1:06 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
this value in ageusd contract?


[03/15/2021 1:08 PM] anon_real#2768
It won't work.


[03/15/2021 1:08 PM] anon_real#2768
User sends some token to an address, assembler then assembles the final tx from that address. So there must be at least enough ERG in that address for tx fee.


[03/15/2021 1:09 PM] anon_real#2768
Which is something like 0.002 ERG.


[03/15/2021 1:09 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
oh, understand

...update on the issue I was seeing with the -Xmx1G setting not being honored...

It looks like the 1GB limit *is* now being honored by the JVM and the node is now staying below the 1GB limit. The difference seems to be happening now that the node has fully synced. During the initial synchronization, the node was consistently consuming 1.6GB of RAM. Now that the node is fully synced though, it is staying below 1GB:

@cymatic after sync, no need to consume a lot of RAM at all )


[03/16/2021 2:46 PM] kushti#0978
Why the limit is ignored during the sync is more interesting


[03/20/2021 6:54 PM] george79#6437
Hi. My PC crashed and I could not initialise node because of corrupted or missing files in \history\objects folder. I decided to make a fresh start. The "old" folder size is about 5GB, the node and wallet was fully synchronised then. Now I can see my new folder size is about 250MB... How long does it take to get it full synchronised? I didn't count full synchronisation time previously...


[03/20/2021 7:06 PM] kushti#0978
@george79 4.0.8 should be 2-3 hours


[03/20/2021 7:09 PM] george79#6437
Hmmm... It will take 2-3 days in my opinion here... It's so slooooow. Am I doing sth wrong here? I just copied jar and conf files to new folder and started the node. It started OK, now it is running well, but the folder size is growing very slow. EDIT: Does the speed of a drive matter? I had the first folder on SSD drive, the second one is on HDD drive.


[03/20/2021 7:44 PM] george79#6437
Or maybe I should perform full startup procedure instead copying old files to new directory?


[03/20/2021 8:06 PM] kushti#0978
@george79 I have very weak and slowly dying HDD from 2016 on my testing machine, it is within 3-4 hours still


[03/20/2021 8:06 PM] kushti#0978
how much RAM do you give ?


[03/20/2021 9:06 PM] george79#6437
I didn't set RAM limit - just basic step by step instruction from the blog. It just stuck on 229MB. I'll perform full startup procedure.


[03/20/2021 9:22 PM] george79#6437
Ok, I fixed it. I had to execute "Running the node for the first time" thing first and then "Update config file with API key hash" from the procedure https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_02_how_to_setup/. Long story short first I had to run the conf file without the API key hash and then with the API key hash. Now the folder is getting bigger and bigger every minute. I don't know why it worked, but it did.

George, for comparison, I just recently set up a node on a smallish VPS that had only 2GB of RAM. It took my node 20-24 hours to fully synch (it crashed a couple of times so it had to pick up where it left off, so I don't know the exact amount of time, but it was finally completely done after about 24 hours)


[03/21/2021 12:26 PM] george79#6437
@cymatic I solved the problem. I had to follow the first steps of procedure instead just copying files one by one. The full sync time - it's about 3 hours.


[03/21/2021 12:50 PM] cymatic#8185
3 hours for your sync lines up with what kushti said should be expected...I guess my sync time being so long was the outlier for some reason. Glad you got it working!


[03/22/2021 10:56 PM] kushti#0978
@cymatic did you use -Xmx flag ?


[03/23/2021 12:05 AM] cymatic#8185
Yes, I used -Xmx1G

@cymatic if you can send me logs regarding crashes, would be great!


[03/23/2021 1:29 PM] cymatic#8185
Sure thing...where does the node keep its crash log files?


[03/30/2021 11:12 PM] kushti#0978
ordinary log is usually enough ergo.log

I set up my first node last month using the manual install option, and now I'm setting up a new one using Docker (first one was on a VPS but this one I'm running locally). On the manual install, the node UI showed how far it had gotten in the sync process, but now with the Docker install a couple things look different. Where does it show the currently-synced block height? Here's what it looks like now:

@cymatic some build process glitch, will check, can you please make a GH issue ?


[04/15/2021 4:33 AM] cymatic#8185
Added, issue #1331


[04/15/2021 4:36 AM] cymatic#8185
Also my new node that I built today synced in 7.5 hours which is much faster than the 17-20 hours it took on the VPS I used last month. For reference, the VPS node was running with 1 GB and a single CPU core, while the node I built on my local machine today had 3 GB and four cores.


[04/15/2021 4:39 AM] cymatic#8185
One really interesting thing I noticed was that at the beginning of the sync, the process was flying. At the rate blocks were syncing in the first couple of hours, I thought the node was going to fully sync in 3-4 hours. However as the sync progressed, the rate at which the block height was increasing began to slow down more and more. In the end, it took 7.5 hours to complete. Any idea why the block acquisition rate wasn't linear? (my machine didn't appear to be bogged down on resources during the sync and seemed to have headroom on CPU/RAM/bandwidth)


[04/15/2021 10:00 AM] morphic#4133
Hi, which version of the node you built?


[04/15/2021 1:06 PM] cymatic#8185
4.0.9


[04/15/2021 2:07 PM] MetaStakePool#0120
Hello, trying to send funds from a mining address to my main and I get this error:
reason: MaxInputsExceededError(240 boxes exceed max inputs in transaction (100))

How to work-aroud this?


[04/15/2021 3:33 PM] MetaStakePool#0120
ok i guess the answer is to: send the balance in small chunks


[04/15/2021 4:39 PM] morphic#4133
This version comes with accelerated Sigma. 
The script interpreter have special handling for simple P2PK addresses and also top 10 most frequently used scripts are always cached and hence processed 5x faster on average. This cover like 90% of the inputs in blocks before 200000, that is why you see much faster processing (provided the network in not a bottleneck)
After height 200000 many complex contracts (ErgoMixer and others) started to appear on the chain, and the current interpreter is not very efficient on them. 
Also UTXO size is growing, so maybe there is some linear overhead in UTXO handling.
In v5.0 scripts will be much faster, so further speedup on complex contracts is expected.


[04/16/2021 4:47 AM] cymatic#8185
So when the node is syncing it isn't just downloading blocks but is performing some kind of validation processing on each one, for example validating each contract? If so, why?


[04/16/2021 10:45 AM] morphic#4133
yes, by default the historical blocks are validated during sync. As an owner of the node you can bypass validation of historical blocks, but then how do you know you are on the valid chain? 
There is the config parameter to turn-off validation of the historical blocks before v2 protocol fork (see skipV1TransactionsValidation) which is true by default, and it may be another reason why you saw fast sync at the begining.

[04/16/2021 5:27 PM] cymatic#8185
I figured some type of validation would be necessary but assumed something like a hash could be used instead of inspecting the internals of each block and revalidating scripts. Just my lack of awareness though and I know that there was well thought out reasoning behind what is happening. Thanks for the responses!


[04/19/2021 11:29 AM] kushti#0978
@cymatic there's "light" regime where the node is not storing UTXO set, and can validate only limited in length suffix of full blocks . Such nodes are running on Raspberry Pi with 0.5 GB given even.


[04/20/2021 12:16 PM] pragmaxim#0778
is it possible that Node does not accept any new blocks while syncing? I'm talking about `SemanticallySuccessfulModifier(mod: ErgoFullBlock)`


[04/20/2021 12:20 PM] pragmaxim#0778
I'm testing some ErgoMiner changes I've done and it starts mining only when new block comes ... in case of  `mining = true & useExternalMiner = false`  ... however no block comes .... I will have to test it on some initialized node


[04/20/2021 12:46 PM] pragmaxim#0778
mmm, I think it is ignoring blocks that are much higher than current height ... oki, I have to test it on synced node


[04/23/2021 9:56 AM] LADOPIXŒ£L#6072
The height moves its value every so often without doing anything with the node, always running without stopping it.

this is deprecated I guess, you only need :

    mining = false
  }
}

scorex {
 restApi {
    # Hex-encoded Blake2b256 hash of an API key. 
    # Should be 64-chars long Base16 string.
    # below is the hash of the string 'hello'
    # replace with your actual hash 
    apiKeyHash = "324dcf027dd4a30a932c441f365a25e86b173defa4b8e58948253471b81b72cf"

[04/29/2021 1:24 PM] The Gamerzs#9062
When you have limeted resources like 0.5 Mb Ram, 64GB Storage, a full node will not work.
I'm assuming mine is not running in lite node due to it crashing on max heap size
and has only synced about to block #9000 within the last 4-5 days.

```

I've got him to try the full path for the conf file, but not sure what's going on - anyone on Windows able to assist?


[05/17/2021 9:56 AM] andee#4722
@glasgowm seems like there is no ergo.conf in working directory, so it looks for it in AppData\Local\Temp


[05/17/2021 9:57 AM] andee#4722
my guess would be that there is a hidden extension on both those files, and ergo.conf.txt will work


[05/17/2021 9:57 AM] The Gamerzs#9062
It does say Text document as the file type


[05/17/2021 9:58 AM] andee#4722

just started node sync myself, anyone know how many GB the chain uses?

5GB


[05/17/2021 10:01 AM] The Gamerzs#9062
It takes some time to sync


[05/17/2021 10:02 AM] andee#4722

[05/17/2021 10:03 AM] The Gamerzs#9062
I tried on my 10 thread laptop only got 20k synced after like 4-5 hoirs


[05/17/2021 10:06 AM] andee#4722
I have 4 cores and 8 threads, but it only uses 1 core


[05/17/2021 10:06 AM] The Gamerzs#9062
Why?


[05/17/2021 10:08 AM] andee#4722
no idea


[05/17/2021 10:29 AM] andee#4722
found the culprit. I am using podman, and the JVM doesn't get any information about resources available so it defaults to one thread


[05/17/2021 10:29 AM] andee#4722
added `-e JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS='-XX:ActiveProcessorCount=8'` to the run command


[05/17/2021 10:33 AM] andee#4722
hmm, don't think that fixed it either.. was +200% cpu for a little while only


[05/17/2021 11:34 AM] andee#4722
this is what I ended up with ```podman run --cpu-period=0 \
    -p 9030:9030 \
    -p 127.0.0.1:9053:9053 \
    -v $PWD/data:/home/ergo/.ergo \
    -v $PWD/myergo.conf:/etc/myergo.conf \
    -e MAX_HEAP=3G \
    -e JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS='-XX:ActiveProcessorCount=8 -XX:-UseContainerSupport' \
    docker.io/ergoplatform/ergo --mainnet -c /etc/myergo.conf```

Q&A on mining (for pool operators and solo miners)
This Q&A is for pool operators and solo miners mostly.  Why are mining rewards going to some strange addresses?   Mining rewards are going to UTXOs associated with special scripts which are locking rewards to miner public keys for 720 blocks (72 in the testnet). Examples of such scripts are mPdcmQkPPvyJZtvwyc2ZFboEue1X1uMw729UbUhe5ZoQJAQsWyKmLck...

As I've setup things 100% to the guide and seeing a BAD API error assuming I'm missing something in the conf.


[05/27/2021 10:38 AM] geezar#8187
Secret/installation and sync (not complete) AOK just the API section and initialising the wallet - so is the video correct or is the guide on the site correct or somewhere in between ? üôÇ


[05/27/2021 10:39 AM] geezar#8187
Perhaps missing something but the guide https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Set-up-a-full-node does not include this dir line thanks

Question: I was using /wallet/deriveKey to experiment with brute forcing discovery of derived keys, but now realize I just cluttered up my node state with all these keys. Is there a way to clean this up?

no need to explicitly set dirs now

If you want to leave only secret seed, remove wallet/registry and wallet/storage folders (derived keys are in the latter folder)

[05/30/2021 2:01 PM] glasgowm#9381
Try 

`java -jar -Xmx3G ergo-*.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf`


[05/30/2021 2:01 PM] glasgowm#9381
but I think you need to delete `/.ergo` and resync, that's what @Dmitry Usov recommended I try


[05/30/2021 2:02 PM] glasgowm#9381 (pinned)
https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/releases
for now you can download ergo full node
run it by command 
`java -jar -Xmx3G ergo-*.jar --mainnet -c setting.conf`
where ‚Äòergo-.jar‚Äô ergo jar file name
and setting.conf is 
```
ergo {
  
  node {
    mining = false
  }
}

scorex {
 restApi {
   
    apiKeyHash = "7dc54010ebabef20ee911d5da47ddae57f492cad6994d76bfa2b1f3b56edff77"
  }
}

its not something you need to have, its JDK arguments


[05/30/2021 2:16 PM] glasgowm#9381
It's just an option for the JDK - what OS are you on?


[05/30/2021 2:16 PM] Ali_G(not financial advisor)#0971

[05/30/2021 2:30 PM] Ali_G(not financial advisor)#0971

[05/30/2021 2:35 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
no


[05/30/2021 2:35 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
you need to wait when wallet is synced


[05/30/2021 2:35 PM] Ali_G(not financial advisor)#0971

thank @Dmitry Usov  you are very enthusiasm


[05/30/2021 3:16 PM] andee#4722
maybe someone using windows could write a powershell script for these things?

Just blank it


[05/30/2021 3:32 PM] andee#4722
@Ali_G(not financial advisor) that's the console output from the running node


[05/30/2021 3:32 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
No need to input


[05/30/2021 3:32 PM] Dmitry Usov#0134
It can be blank @teppi


[05/30/2021 3:34 PM] Ali_G(not financial advisor)#0971
it says it cant connect?!


[05/30/2021 3:34 PM] Ali_G(not financial advisor)#0971
failed to connect


[05/30/2021 3:34 PM] Ali_G(not financial advisor)#0971
change address not specified?!


[05/30/2021 3:36 PM] andee#4722
use the panel for checking the nodes state, to understand all the output in the console you will need to learn how the node works


[05/30/2021 3:36 PM] andee#4722
and that is outside the scope of using it as a wallet


[05/30/2021 3:36 PM] Ali_G(not financial advisor)#0971
Node is synced - Wallet is synced


[05/30/2021 3:37 PM] Ali_G(not financial advisor)#0971
So everything is ok then?


[05/30/2021 3:37 PM] teppi#8003
exactly


[05/30/2021 3:37 PM] andee#4722
as long as current height is correct, then yes @Ali_G(not financial advisor)


[05/30/2021 3:38 PM] Ali_G(not financial advisor)#0971
alright


[05/30/2021 3:50 PM] teppi#8003
finally to this problem


[05/30/2021 3:50 PM] teppi#8003
delete 2 file and folder

oh ok


[05/30/2021 4:05 PM] teppi#8003
yoroi has a problem


[05/30/2021 4:06 PM] teppi#8003
if yoroi's wallet connect to a miner to mine ergo


[05/30/2021 4:06 PM] teppi#8003
its become very slowly


[05/30/2021 4:06 PM] teppi#8003
even crash


[05/30/2021 4:07 PM] teppi#8003
so full node is a good other option


[05/30/2021 4:32 PM] Ali_G(not financial advisor)#0971
whys everyone complaining about yoroi wallet. I dont see any problems?!


[05/30/2021 4:39 PM] dapovoa#2043
Anybody knows how to configure the config.json?


[05/30/2021 4:39 PM] dapovoa#2043
I have mine as:
{ 
    "mnemonic" : "my_mnemonic_phrase",
    "mnemonicPass": "my_password",
    "node" : "http://127.0.0.1:9053", 
    "keepPrehash" : true 
    }


[05/30/2021 4:39 PM] dapovoa#2043
I'm getting three errors on miner:
current valid option are "node"
current valid option are "node"
current valid option are "node"


[05/30/2021 4:39 PM] dapovoa#2043
so, I'm guessing that the only option valid is "node" : "http://127.0.0.1:9053"


[05/30/2021 4:40 PM] dapovoa#2043
The node is synced, so how do I mine solo from my node?


[05/30/2021 4:40 PM] dapovoa#2043
Any help would be much appreciated!


[05/30/2021 4:52 PM] andee#4722
```ergo {
  node {
    mining = false
  }
}```


[05/30/2021 5:14 PM] teppi#8003
If you mine, u will see


[05/30/2021 6:44 PM] dapovoa#2043
maybe an unknown subject...


[05/30/2021 6:51 PM] andee#4722
@Ali_G(not financial advisor) because people were unable to send transactions and miner payouts was not reflected in the wallet


[05/30/2021 9:49 PM] geezar#8187
Same reason I run a node now - suggest if anyone has more issues you do the same


[05/30/2021 9:50 PM] geezar#8187
TBH they have resolved previous issues and the team seem to be responsive with an active GIT but personally.. I like the control of having my node üôÇ

right now people are working on things that are important for progress and have high priority, being able to run nodes on raspberry pi is probably not even on the list. As the community grows I am certain that someone will make it happen though


[05/31/2021 1:46 AM] teppi#8003
i have a question.


[05/31/2021 1:46 AM] teppi#8003
i created multiple addresses in yoroi's wallet


[05/31/2021 1:46 AM] teppi#8003
after restore to node, its only show 1 address


[05/31/2021 1:47 AM] teppi#8003
other addresses not view in list

@teppi I don't know if you have to derive from a path or not, but  `/wallet/deriveNextKey` generates extra addresses


[05/31/2021 6:40 AM] teppi#8003
I have 3 addresses in one private key, now i can only get 1 address

yes, and using deriveKey will give you another one


[05/31/2021 7:10 AM] andee#4722
but you need to use the same derivation path as in yoroi


[05/31/2021 7:11 AM] teppi#8003
no

[05/31/2021 8:46 PM] Admin (Fairhash.org)#6766
and one more question, how one can calculate hashrate of  the network from difficulty of the network at this moment?


[05/31/2021 9:03 PM] andee#4722
@Admin (Fairhash.org) Calculating current nethash based on the diff will be inaccurate. Why not use the API?


[05/31/2021 9:03 PM] Admin (Fairhash.org)#6766
there should be exact formula not?


[05/31/2021 9:04 PM] andee#4722
https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/731.pdf


[05/31/2021 9:11 PM] Admin (Fairhash.org)#6766
this is not exactly what I was looking for.


[05/31/2021 9:11 PM] Admin (Fairhash.org)#6766
I know difficulty of the last block


[05/31/2021 9:11 PM] Admin (Fairhash.org)#6766
and blockchain explorer shows hashrate of  the network too


[05/31/2021 9:11 PM] Admin (Fairhash.org)#6766
how they are related?


[05/31/2021 9:15 PM] andee#4722
You would probably need to dig into the source. My uneducated guess would be that the block time needs to be factored in


[05/31/2021 9:28 PM] andee#4722
seems like the explorer just adds together the diff from the blocks in the past 24 hours and divides it by numbers of seconds in a day + 1


[05/31/2021 9:28 PM] andee#4722
I think herominers calculation is more dynamic


[05/31/2021 9:29 PM] andee#4722
```dailyHashRate(difficulty: Long): Long = (difficulty / SecondsIn24H) + 1L
val hashRate      = dailyHashRate(blocks.map(_.difficulty).sum)```


[05/31/2021 10:13 PM] andee#4722
I think (current diff TH / average blocktime seconds) might be what herominers uses


[05/31/2021 10:24 PM] Ali_G(not financial advisor)#0971
What does actually running a node gives me?


[05/31/2021 10:28 PM] andee#4722

Hey everybody. Can anyone help me with how to change a password for your node wallet?


[06/02/2021 2:20 PM] andee#4722
@DenAce I think you would need to delete wallet folder and restore from seed

@andee thx, that worked... Is there a different way planned? Seems a little over the top for people who don't know that ^^ (or don't understand it even if explained)


[06/02/2021 2:27 PM] andee#4722
it will probably be implemented at some point, there are just so many things that are more important to get done


[06/02/2021 2:27 PM] andee#4722
most probably just use yoroi, unless they need a wallet controllable via API or supports multisig


[06/02/2021 2:54 PM] DenAce#1197
I tried generating more adresses now with derivatekey function. Do you know why 3 adresses are now shown and 2 of them have the same adress?

Is there any reason I can't manage a BTC ASIC miner from the same machine that I'm running an ERGO node on? (assuming I have the hardware req's)


[06/06/2021 12:07 AM] andee#4722
@Dergler not that I own any of those, but most just use a web GUI via the IP of the miner?


[06/06/2021 12:07 AM] andee#4722
node shouldn't interfere with that


[06/06/2021 2:21 AM] Dergler#0451
right on, I'm forging ahead to see what I discover. one linux machine with ERGO, Urbit, and a BTC miner running off the USB. lets see how it goes lol

guys I think this `ErgoReadersHolder` actor should be subscribe/publish to avoid the `ask` pattern all over the code base ... ie. it should notify subscribers of changes

@kushti the consumers are Actors so they could hold and update the state

[08/02/2021 5:40 PM] geezar#8187
When you mentioned the Pi idea, struck me its a good idea and in lieu of the alternatives... I pity those buying ledgers for other crytpo not knowing about the dangers (even new from Amazon) think if I control the wallet makes more sense - only myself to blame if it goes wrong due to bad management/exposing it to bad actors


[08/02/2021 5:41 PM] BuzzLiteBeer#8676
Yeah when I saw the online stuff it worried me quite a bit. I'm trying to figure out the stratum server thing now so I can start solo mining off my own node.


[08/03/2021 3:45 PM] geezar#8187
When you do would be interested to hear how you get on - not sure if there is a medium post or something or perhaps a wiki section on the GIT would help people try it - I've only mined solo on basic QT wallets in the past but assume not too challenging to setup - a sequential process/steps would reduce the centralisation on the chain which can only be a good thing IMO


[08/03/2021 4:23 PM] BuzzLiteBeer#8676
Just got a mining node running on my pi b3+, when I get home from work I'll try to start mining on it. Not sure what to do yet, gonna have to scrounge the net until I find some guides. I may just start making some Ergo content since there really isn't much out there right now. Even the official youtube guide he makes several mistakes in the code and if you follow it exactly you won't get a running node.

How to setup an Ergo node on a Raspberry Pi
Mute if you dont want to hear my vega64‚Äôs breathing in the background. I made this because the official one contains some errors and leaves out some useful information. If you follow along and do as I did, you will have a fully running node, it will take some time for it to fully sync the node on your pi. This process is nearly identical for set...

Nothing fancy follow along video I put up, if you follow it you will have a running node on your pi.

how do you open a port to mine?  miner is reporting the  port is closed by remote host, firewall is open


[08/08/2021 5:56 PM] sudo_scientist#4060
also, how to find ip of node to connect other machines?


[08/09/2021 2:13 PM] andee#4722
you have to open the port on the router

Hi folks, I'm struggling with issues getting the Windows (and Linux) nodes installed. I made a reddit post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/comments/p13jhl/windows_node_error_cant_continue_syncing/ This is affecting two both my windows and now my raspberry pi nodes. Neither can sync and I'm at my wits end, but I don't have an android device and hate web wallets, and really dislike holding funds on an exchange. Any help would be appreciated.

@WompYourFace just to clarify, emurgo does not have any way to get to your crypto when using yoroi. the wallet is still local on your device even if its a browser extension


[08/09/2021 10:55 PM] WompYourFace#5039
so Yoroi is as secure as a node would be?


[08/09/2021 10:59 PM] andee#4722
I use a separate browser for things like metamask and yoroi since one extension I use for vim shortcuts has access to just about everything I write etc.


[08/09/2021 11:33 PM] WompYourFace#5039
Alright, I've got yoroi set up for the time being. Thanks

Mine Ergo From Your Own Node, Zero Pool Fees
Follow along in this video to get a node going on your local network, followed by a stratum server, then mine to it! Avoid pool fees and help to further decentralize Ergo. This was all done on a fresh install of windows 10 pro that was fully updated.

We're working on improving DB consistency


[08/13/2021 11:59 PM] angrymoose#7520
How long does it normally take a new node to synchronize?


[08/14/2021 7:49 AM] andee#4722
depends on your computer, check what size .ergo folder is. It is a 6-7GB when fully synced


[08/14/2021 9:54 PM] angrymoose#7520
Thanks. Mine is 800M about 24 hrs in to syncing


[08/15/2021 4:39 AM] uyuck#1185
how do i get my current height on my node to catch up with explorer, for some reason its not moving, says its synced. also only shows part of my balance in my wallet, when i click my address it shows the actual amount i mined. my node height is 540135, explorer shows 554713?


[08/15/2021 5:54 AM] andee#4722
if the folder size is not increasing any longer the sync is stuck. 24 hours is way to long time


[08/15/2021 5:57 AM] andee#4722
the db has probably been corrupted. I think there is a fix upcoming in the next version of the node, but right now the only way of fixing it it deleting .ergo/history .ergo/state and resync


[08/15/2021 6:03 AM] uyuck#1185
ok i deleted that folder how do i get it to resync


[08/15/2021 6:05 AM] uyuck#1185
i did close and reopen the power shell after i removed the folder


[08/15/2021 6:15 AM] andee#4722
it should start syncing when you start the node again. if it does not it is probably because you deleted them while the node was running


[08/15/2021 6:24 AM] uyuck#1185
the node stops when you close the power shell or do i have to put a command line in?


[08/15/2021 6:34 AM] uyuck#1185
ok its in active sync will see once its done


[08/15/2021 9:06 AM] venoox#1937
why does my node keep doing this for hours

is it not syncing?


[08/15/2021 9:29 AM] venoox#1937
nope


[08/15/2021 9:30 AM] venoox#1937
on node interface it says it‚Äôs connected to 30 peers


[08/15/2021 10:04 AM] andee#4722
and height?


[08/15/2021 10:11 AM] venoox#1937
it doesn't show me the height


[08/15/2021 10:15 AM] andee#4722
stop node. delete `.ergo/{history,state}`


[08/15/2021 10:15 AM] andee#4722
start node


[08/15/2021 3:11 PM] uyuck#1185
@andee thanks for the assestance last night when i woke up it had finshed sync and found the 50 ergo i was missing from my wallet.

Hey guys. I have a Pi 4 just sitting idle, think I'll run an Ergo node. Would be benefit me alone or the project as a whole ?


[08/15/2021 6:21 PM] Inerthal#9602
And also, how does mining work ? I understand there is some sort of integration with the node and mining, from what I can see in the config file one has to create to run a node.


[08/16/2021 11:59 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
people trying the Android app when coming from Node say that the generated address is different. Doesn't the Node generates addresses with path m / 44' / 429' / 0' / 0 / 0 by default?


[08/16/2021 6:35 PM] user#4413
hello , im getting the following message all of a suden :
ERROR [ctor.default-dispatcher-7] scorex.db.StoreRegistry - Failed to initialize storage: org.fusesource.leveldbjni.internal.NativeDB$DBException: Corruption: 26 missing files; e.g.: *****\state\ldb_main/057179.ldb. Please check that directory state\ldb_main exists and is not used by some other active node


[08/16/2021 6:36 PM] user#4413
I must say that earlier today i deleted the db as some people suggested .. because of issues with sort-of-missing Ergo


[08/16/2021 6:43 PM] apexpool#3878
did you delete the ldb_main directory, or just the contents?


[08/16/2021 6:43 PM] apexpool#3878
if you deleted it, did you create it again after that?


[08/16/2021 6:49 PM] user#4413
its actually there ...


[08/16/2021 6:49 PM] user#4413
but i get this message


[08/16/2021 7:01 PM] apexpool#3878
did you stop the previous node daemon?


[08/16/2021 9:50 PM] user#4413
yes


[08/16/2021 9:56 PM] andee#4722
I have just deleted history and state folder, while node is not running ofc.


[08/16/2021 9:56 PM] andee#4722
it should then recreate the folders needed by itself when it starts to sync


[08/17/2021 7:35 AM] user#4413
I just emptied the contents of history and state folder once again . 
Gots to get to work now, i will update when im back


[08/19/2021 6:23 PM] CypherPet#3447
no, first address is the same but the derivation path when creating new one is different (m/1/2) , I managed to recover one of my yoroi "derivated" address by derivating with your path (which can also be found in the yoroi recieve tab) . And those " ' " are important. 
{
  "derivationPath": "m / 44' / 429' / 0' / 0 / 1 "
}

tbh üòÖ it's kinda hard to jump into all of this with the documentation being split out all over between discord, git, forum, blog, etc. I'm learning the hard way üí™


[08/19/2021 6:43 PM] CypherPet#3447
Also quick question, [tor.default-dispatcher-x]?  Does the node uses the tor network?


[08/19/2021 6:45 PM] andee#4722
agreed. hopefully someone that loves writing docs comes along üòÉ I fully understand that its hard to keep up with everything when the devs are working full time forwards


[08/19/2021 6:45 PM] andee#4722
no, its a little misleading. but it can be configured to


[08/19/2021 6:53 PM] CypherPet#3447
ok thanks. that could have explained my timeouts, tor is blocked at my office. testnet is running fine though (except for the faucet which only reply "null"..)  got a mainnet node running at home and found all my lost transactions from earlier. i<m almost ready to start playing around lol


[08/19/2021 7:01 PM] andee#4722
I can send you some testnet coins if you are unable to get through the faucet


[08/19/2021 7:05 PM] CypherPet#3447
that would be great!


[08/20/2021 2:08 PM] zennethx#3207
how do I restore my old wallet address? It has a different address on my node wallet than the one it had before.


[08/20/2021 2:51 PM] andee#4722
it should be as simple as restoring using your mnemonic. did you have more than one address on your previous wallet?


[08/20/2021 2:52 PM] andee#4722
and does the address you have now start with 9? one had a problem with the node running as a testnet node


[08/20/2021 3:25 PM] zennethx#3207
I restored by mnemonic but it doesn't seem to have worked... I'm not sure how to proceed. Yes, address starts with 9


[08/20/2021 3:33 PM] CypherPet#3447
is the wallet fully synced? it can take a while to scan through all the blocks to get the actual balance.


[08/20/2021 3:55 PM] zennethx#3207
It's the wrong wallet address


[08/20/2021 3:55 PM] andee#4722
have you checked the address you have now using the explorer?


[08/20/2021 3:55 PM] zennethx#3207
I mean yes but there was nothing I could see different it just has 0 transactions


[08/20/2021 3:58 PM] andee#4722
http://localhost:9053/swagger#/wallet/walletDeriveKey click 'Try it out'


[08/20/2021 3:59 PM] andee#4722
`  "derivationPath": "m/44'/429'/0'/0/0" `


[08/20/2021 3:59 PM] andee#4722
wallet needs to be unlocked, and you need to authorize on top right on swagger


[08/20/2021 4:00 PM] andee#4722
click execute and check the address you get in the response

[08/20/2021 4:04 PM] zennethx#3207
okay I deleted the directory and am going to start fresh... is that a bad idea?


[08/20/2021 4:05 PM] andee#4722
no problem as long as you have the right mnemonic


[08/20/2021 4:05 PM] andee#4722
have you tried the mnemonic on yoroi?


[08/20/2021 4:06 PM] zennethx#3207
I don't have yoroi


[08/20/2021 4:06 PM] zennethx#3207
this worked fine a few weeks ago but after reinstalling windows it's just being shitty


[08/20/2021 4:07 PM] zennethx#3207
I don't understand why it's giving me a different address than what my mnemonic is linked to


[08/20/2021 4:08 PM] andee#4722
yoroi is an easy way to check though


[08/20/2021 4:14 PM] zennethx#3207
check what?


[08/20/2021 4:15 PM] andee#4722
that you get your expected address and wallet balance


[08/20/2021 4:16 PM] zennethx#3207
I want to fix my node & wallet. I don't need to verify that address or wallet as I know it was mine.


[08/20/2021 4:17 PM] zennethx#3207
my problem now is it's not writing to my ergo directory despite it being set in my configuration file


[08/20/2021 4:17 PM] andee#4722
use minimal config


[08/20/2021 4:18 PM] andee#4722
```ergo {
  node {
    mining = false
  }
}```

you might also have some permission problem


[08/20/2021 4:25 PM] zennethx#3207
working directory? secret directory? Both in /windows/system32?


[08/20/2021 4:25 PM] zennethx#3207
what is going on here?


[08/20/2021 4:32 PM] zennethx#3207
the tutorial I was using is from this year and the one you linked is from two years ago... but the one you linked has that in the config file yet there is no mention at all in the updated tutorial


[08/20/2021 4:33 PM] andee#4722
the one I linked is the one that is updated


[08/20/2021 4:33 PM] andee#4722
last updated 9.Jan


[08/20/2021 4:33 PM] zennethx#3207
okay that's the one I was following the 9 Jan one


[08/20/2021 4:34 PM] andee#4722
follow the text, not the video


[08/20/2021 4:34 PM] zennethx#3207
my bad I forgot I had searched "ergo working directory secret directory" and that's what came up was the old tutorial


[08/20/2021 4:34 PM] andee#4722
.ergo folder should be in the same dir as you run the jar


[08/20/2021 4:35 PM] zennethx#3207
there is no mention of .ergo folder in that tutorial is why I asked


[08/20/2021 4:35 PM] zennethx#3207
there is no mention of any directories at all


[08/20/2021 4:36 PM] zennethx#3207
Create a dedicated folder (such as ~/ergo) for running the node. Denote by ergo_folder the folder where the jar is kept.


[08/20/2021 4:36 PM] zennethx#3207
that is the only mention but it has no example in the tutorial


[08/20/2021 4:36 PM] zennethx#3207
it just says "Denote by ergo_folder where the jar is kept"


[08/20/2021 4:37 PM] zennethx#3207
the older tutorial does go into detail but if I'm running a basic config it won't even have that


[08/20/2021 4:37 PM] andee#4722
.ergo folder is irrelevant for most users. there is no need to mention it in the tutorial


[08/20/2021 4:38 PM] zennethx#3207
so why is it not irrelevant for me?


[08/20/2021 4:38 PM] zennethx#3207
that's why I'm confused I created a new directory, have my config files in it as well as the jar file


[08/20/2021 4:39 PM] andee#4722
you were the one saying the node was not writing anything


[08/20/2021 4:39 PM] andee#4722
then its pretty essential to check the folder it actually writes to


[08/20/2021 4:39 PM] zennethx#3207
java -jar d:\.erg\ergo-4.0.13.jar --mainnet -c d:\.erg\ergo.conf
pause


[08/20/2021 4:39 PM] zennethx#3207
it *was* writing


[08/20/2021 4:39 PM] zennethx#3207
I didn't change anything in my config files or directories


[08/20/2021 4:39 PM] zennethx#3207
I simply reinstalled and copied it back over after installing JRE


[08/20/2021 4:39 PM] andee#4722
I am not very knowledgeable about windows, but I seriously doubt that is a valid path


[08/20/2021 4:40 PM] zennethx#3207
lol obviously there's a backslash missing


[08/20/2021 4:40 PM] andee#4722
and use a normal name, like ergo for the node folder


[08/20/2021 4:40 PM] zennethx#3207
but that's a recent change


[08/20/2021 4:40 PM] zennethx#3207
that just happened it was all left the same when it gave me the different address


[08/20/2021 4:41 PM] andee#4722
I would also cd to the folder where the jar is before running it


[08/20/2021 4:41 PM] zennethx#3207
java -jar d:\.erg\ergo-4.0.13.jar --mainnet -c d:\.erg\ergo.conf


[08/20/2021 4:42 PM] zennethx#3207
it's deleting that d:\.erg


[08/20/2021 4:42 PM] zennethx#3207
it's deleting the backslash and the period due to discord


[08/20/2021 4:42 PM] andee#4722
use backticks ``


[08/20/2021 4:42 PM] zennethx#3207
it's a valid directory that has nothing to do with how it runs


[08/20/2021 4:43 PM] zennethx#3207
that's my confusion because I had it in d:\ergo


[08/20/2021 4:43 PM] zennethx#3207
then I just changed it to "d:\.erg"


[08/20/2021 4:43 PM] zennethx#3207
or 'd:\.erg'


[08/20/2021 4:43 PM] zennethx#3207
anyway you know .erg is a valid directory regardless


[08/20/2021 4:43 PM] zennethx#3207
should have no affect


[08/20/2021 4:44 PM] andee#4722
the node has reacted on strange folder names for windows users. having a number in the beginning messes things up as one example


[08/20/2021 4:45 PM] andee#4722
dude, just follow the guide


[08/20/2021 4:45 PM] andee#4722
```Open a command prompt and cd to ergo_folder. Then issue the following command to run the node for the first time:

 java -jar ergo-<release>.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf```


[08/20/2021 4:45 PM] andee#4722
stop messing with paths in the java command etc.


[08/20/2021 4:45 PM] andee#4722
following the guide works


[08/20/2021 4:46 PM] andee#4722
.ergo folder will be created in the same folder as you have the config and jar


[08/20/2021 4:46 PM] zennethx#3207
I followed the guide 100%


[08/20/2021 4:46 PM] zennethx#3207
and guess what it still isn't


[08/20/2021 4:47 PM] andee#4722
no, when you use a bat that runs the node using paths instead of running it from the actual folder you are not following it 100%


[08/20/2021 4:47 PM] zennethx#3207
that's not specified so yes I am


[08/20/2021 4:47 PM] andee#4722
@zennethx


[08/20/2021 4:48 PM] zennethx#3207
so every time I want to run the node I have to open a command prompt to type that in?


[08/20/2021 4:48 PM] zennethx#3207
from that specific directory despite using a batch file running it from that directory?


[08/20/2021 4:48 PM] andee#4722
no, you could just cd to the folder before you run the jar


[08/20/2021 4:49 PM] andee#4722
if you run the bat from the same dir, why do you specify the path at all?


[08/20/2021 4:49 PM] andee#4722
I am not saying this is your problem, but don't add things that aren't needed


[08/20/2021 4:49 PM] zennethx#3207
I ran it fine this way previously which is where my questions arise


[08/20/2021 4:50 PM] zennethx#3207
I'll figure it out thanks for trying


[08/20/2021 4:50 PM] zennethx#3207
not trying to waste your time in any fashion truly


[08/20/2021 4:51 PM] andee#4722
have you enabled viewing hidden folders again?


[08/20/2021 4:51 PM] zennethx#3207
I'm sure your explanation is why I was having issues but it makes no sense to me


[08/20/2021 4:54 PM] zennethx#3207
it was all in how I ran the jar file


[08/20/2021 4:55 PM] zennethx#3207
running it from a batch script on my desktop caused it to freak out


[08/20/2021 4:56 PM] zennethx#3207
previously I simply had a shortcut to the script in the directory and this time I just created the file on my desktop and didn't know it would need to be started from within that directory


[08/20/2021 4:56 PM] zennethx#3207
I deleted that and just created another shortcut from the file in the directory and it works


[08/20/2021 4:56 PM] zennethx#3207
still gonna have to restore my wallet but I bet I should be good


[08/20/2021 5:10 PM] andee#4722
a cd to ergo_folder before running the jar would probably have worked


[08/20/2021 5:11 PM] CypherPet#3447

[08/20/2021 5:15 PM] CypherPet#3447
the .ergo folder is created by the node on the first boot. it shouldn't be there the first time you launch it.. otherwise you'll get some database issues


[08/20/2021 5:16 PM] CypherPet#3447
also, obviously you replace testnet by mainnet

Hi everyone, I create an Ergo Wallet, the Node Sync at a wrong Current height (542181) and the wallet don't sync.
Can someone guide me or explain how I can resolve this. Thanks

[08/21/2021 11:53 AM] andee#4722
@Tanck13 probably database error, fix upcoming in next release. stop node, delete `.ergo/{history,state}` start node again and wait for resync


[08/21/2021 11:54 AM] Tanck13#8473
thank you for answering. I will try it now


[08/21/2021 12:02 PM] Tanck13#8473
@andee  that didn't work, still the same Current height. 
Do you know how can I re-start a syn?


[08/21/2021 12:02 PM] andee#4722
refresh the page. if you deleted both those folders it will start syncing again


[08/21/2021 12:04 PM] andee#4722
if output on node says things like Got x modifers and Apply modifier its syncing


[08/21/2021 12:06 PM] Tanck13#8473
@andee  it work, thank you very much. I hope I can get my few ergo coin at the end.


[08/22/2021 5:40 PM] Deathswit#2208
Hello, I'm attempting to encrypt network traffic w/administering ergo Node and accessing wallet. I have the ergo node setup on my centos  box and assuming there's no way to enable that with the node software i can use TLS(https) so I setup a reverse proxy(nginx) which loads the site with cert and encrypts my lan traffic, which is good!.  BUT I Get a Bad API key when I try to load the wallet and/or dashboard --- API works when authorizing swagger though.  Any ideas/direction would be good. Don't want to run this on my windows machine, and sending my API key along with wallet password in clear text on my LAN makes me very nervous.


[08/22/2021 6:35 PM] andee#4722
I don't think swagger does any check on the key you input via the page. you need to run a call to see if it declines or accepts it


[08/22/2021 6:39 PM] Deathswit#2208
the same API key works if I don't use the reverse proxy. It's odd


[08/22/2021 6:48 PM] andee#4722
have you compared headers?

[08/24/2021 4:16 AM] CypherPet#3447
Did you initialize the wallet? I fixed some weird problems by deleting/renaming the wallet foler in the .ergo folder.


[08/24/2021 4:27 AM] BuzzLiteBeer#8676
Yes I recovered one on this node from mnemonic

[08/30/2021 5:01 AM] CypherPet#3447
if you mean "docker" setting up the full "synced" node, I don't think so.. sounds like a security concern if the node state was "compromised"..  but I might be wrong.


[08/30/2021 6:24 AM] andee#4722
there is a image on docker.hub, but you still need to sync

My local node is currently displaying the "Current height" as `568514`, and the "Best block id" is `8e83febc212053fed222e3b7e4a611be732b758b643a52b55703f056ddcff3c7`. According to the node interface, my node is fully synced, however that's about 3000 blocks behind the latest block (570847). Can't see anything particularly obvious in the logs. Has anyone got any ideas? I'm running the v4.0.13 Docker image.

note that, magnum wallet was not using this standard


[09/15/2021 8:19 AM] andee#4722
coinbarn uses the standard derivation path, but it seems like many miners chose the "miner" address and have addresses starting with 88

will check after node is synced. is the coinbarn extension not working at all?


[09/15/2021 8:56 AM] glasgowm#9381
not working, won't work after sync'd as the address is wrong. Just trying to figure out ergo utility now


[09/15/2021 9:00 AM] andee#4722
did you check ‚Äã/mining‚Äã/rewardAddress ?


[09/15/2021 9:01 AM] glasgowm#9381
wdym?


[09/15/2021 9:03 AM] mhs_sam#1471
address starting with 88 is not a regular p2pk address, it's p2s. in this case it's the rewardAddress which you can get it by /mining/rewardAddress in node. It's fund can be spent after 720 blocks.


[09/15/2021 9:04 AM] mhs_sam#1471
btw, I do not know what the user's problem really is. can you describe?


[09/15/2021 9:04 AM] glasgowm#9381
He is trying to access old coinbarn wallet which he selected 'mining address' from


[09/15/2021 9:05 AM] glasgowm#9381
when he restores in node, he doesn't get any addresses starting with `88` - but presumably if he goes to `/mining/rewardAddress/` he can access it from there?


[09/15/2021 9:08 AM] mhs_sam#1471
only if node and coinbarn use the same wallet path. he can check if the rewardAddress in the node is the same as coinbarn. If so, the rewards can be spent through node wallet after 720 blocks. if not, he should use the coinbarn.


[09/15/2021 9:08 AM] glasgowm#9381
Don't think coinbarn works anymore, I've asked him to check, but I imagine it's different


[09/15/2021 9:12 AM] glasgowm#9381
Doesn't seem to do anything for the `88` address 

```bash

but it is diiferent than coinbarn given address


[09/15/2021 9:51 AM] glasgowm#9381
Sending tx does not work from coinbarn - and address is different - what can be done here @mhs_sam  ?


[09/15/2021 10:04 AM] mhs_sam#1471
does he have the private key?


[09/15/2021 10:04 AM] glasgowm#9381
yes


[09/15/2021 10:04 AM] glasgowm#9381

That is an empty one, but I figured the derivation path would be the same


[09/15/2021 10:09 AM] mhs_sam#1471
he can simply spend the coins with his private key


[09/15/2021 10:09 AM] glasgowm#9381
elaborate? He can't spend from within coinbarn - transactions not sending


[09/15/2021 10:10 AM] mhs_sam#1471
no manually


[09/15/2021 10:15 AM] glasgowm#9381

what is his address? be careful, don't send the seed with it


[09/15/2021 10:39 AM] mhs_sam#1471
I have a code that reads all the boxes and sends all of them to to a new address. but, if there are lots of boxes, the code needs some improvements. Let me know its address to see if the current code is suitable or not. If not, I can provide a code by weekend.

did he proceed?


[09/15/2021 11:32 AM] glasgowm#9381
looks like he got it working, will ask how as there's someone else with the same issue.


[09/16/2021 12:52 PM] pragmaxim#0778
@weskinner @kushti Hi, I analysed the token spending issue, the possible solution would need a review : https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/issues/1448


[09/16/2021 4:59 PM] weskinner#4666
I fixed the example to use bobRequest and even with a 5 second delay I get the same error


[09/16/2021 5:02 PM] pragmaxim#0778
@weskinner mm, and is the node synced ? If so, I will keep digging


[09/16/2021 5:05 PM] weskinner#4666
Yes here's the successful alice transaction: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/70f349f6ab27a551301f0365e143010a064cdafb3812f2e2a2e352e9f0f7c7f5

[09/16/2021 5:07 PM] weskinner#4666
This looks like the issue: `out = ByteArrayWrapper[AE5B02D9B81562DAA123BF912AAF4880E87F99B2D7B9505BFD83B39521E92172]`,   `ae5b02d9b81562daa123bf912aaf4880e87f99b2d7b9505bfd83b39521e92172` is the tokenId created in aliceRequest


[09/16/2021 5:13 PM] pragmaxim#0778
with the 5 seconds delay I would expect `in = 1, out = 1` ... without it `in = -1, out = 1` but  `in = 1, out = 2`  ? ü§î Why is the `out = 2` ?


[09/16/2021 5:23 PM] weskinner#4666
Bug in the BoxSelector?


[09/17/2021 9:13 AM] pragmaxim#0778
I'm on it, I'm quite new to assets and the codebase around it ... I did not realize that it was about minting 2 unrelated assets, so yeah, mostly probably BoxSelector issue


[09/17/2021 3:59 PM] pragmaxim#0778
@weskinner imho the problem is that the UTXO created by the 1. Alice's request is used as one of the input boxes for the 2. Bob's request and it would not be used if it wasn't offchain ... this is tougher than it seems


[09/17/2021 4:07 PM] pragmaxim#0778
I'm trying to find some special rules in the node about these singleton-token UTXOs ... if it is treated differently than regular UTXO or not


[09/17/2021 4:08 PM] weskinner#4666
that makes sense.  It shouldn't be trying to use box `836f9a623504606319cd0cd18d8ff9286cebc870a0f2b66d9d7a3640ac4608ca` but it is showing up in the  inputs to the bobRequest


[09/17/2021 4:08 PM] pragmaxim#0778
but why it is not used if it is onchain ? This happens only if it is offchain I guess


[09/17/2021 4:08 PM] weskinner#4666
from the error:
```

[09/17/2021 4:09 PM] weskinner#4666
it should only need the `0754724caf18d5dc426b9e950d34f4311e6436f476f5e171a32a6d08d58ab9ed` output from aliceRequest to pay for the 2nd asset


[09/17/2021 4:09 PM] weskinner#4666
Sorry, can you elaborate on this.  I don't understand what is meant by offchain here


[09/17/2021 4:10 PM] pragmaxim#0778
I guess this would not happen if it disappeared from mempool, ie. became part of chain


[09/17/2021 4:11 PM] weskinner#4666
ahh ok I understand now


[09/17/2021 4:11 PM] weskinner#4666
yes when I wait until aliceRequest is confirmed, bobRequest works


[09/17/2021 4:12 PM] pragmaxim#0778
question is whether considering it as Input box for the Bob's request is valid or not ... if it is valid, then the fix would be in the TX validation code, to take this situation into consideration


[09/17/2021 4:14 PM] weskinner#4666
I think it's `in = -1 out = 1` when I send the assets to a different address, `in = 1 out = 2` when I send to my address.


[09/17/2021 4:14 PM] weskinner#4666
Not sure if that's a different issue or different case of same issue


[09/17/2021 4:17 PM] pragmaxim#0778
it can be LessThen in case of minting new token  `inAmount >= outAmount || (outAssetId == newAssetId && outAmount > 0)`  but the second condition fails due to the Alice box being used for Bob's request I think ... I will continue digging into this, it's deep üôÇ


[09/17/2021 4:29 PM] weskinner#4666
thanks! @kushti said the outputs from alice request can be used in bob request in the same block.  Or maybe I misunderstood..

[09/18/2021 3:16 PM] pragmaxim#0778
the old Alice's AssetId somewhat sneaks into the new Bob's UTXO ... instead of `inputBoxes.head.box.id` ... as a result, the Tx validation fails as the old assetId is twice in the outputs

@weskinner I cannot reproduce it myself, it works fine on testnet and 4.0.14 build, even without any delay .... however if you could `assembly` the jar with these 2 lines added here https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/blob/e68ce6180b13bffb024cf9e26c7c16a7be70a22c/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/nodeView/wallet/ErgoWalletActor.scala#L183

it could prove my theory that this operation does not happen before the Bob's request (which it must)

[09/20/2021 12:09 PM] joshu#5155

[09/20/2021 6:21 PM] weskinner#4666
Yes you're right I thought it was a different issue too

At least I was able to create a PR while researching the issue


[09/20/2021 6:21 PM] pragmaxim#0778
aye, no worries, at least I know how assets are handled under the hood


[09/21/2021 1:29 AM] joshu#5155
@andee I solved the nginx `proxy_pass` problem. The issue being that when "Set API Key" is sent, "Bad Api Key" is returned because the relevant header `api_key` has an underscore in it and is therefore dropped by NGINX.

still syncing? deleted the logs and restarted. any ideas?


[09/24/2021 8:51 AM] pragmaxim#0778
at first it is downloading Headers for like 40 minutes (depends on many factors), that's the "Active synchronization", then you start seeing the height grow which is when it starts fetching actual blocks or other persistent modifiers (like next 3 hours)


[09/24/2021 6:41 PM] Tidus#9660
after 16 hours still in active sync. is that normal?


[09/24/2021 6:42 PM] pragmaxim#0778
no that sounds a lot like some stuck, IDK about any in this phase, check logs for some errors perhaps

all im seeing in the logs i that the synchronizer is going to download some sort of modifiers


[09/24/2021 7:06 PM] pragmaxim#0778
try downloading the `4.0.14` released jar ... and then run it with `java -Xmx2048m` ... maybe it needs more memory on your system


[09/24/2021 7:07 PM] pragmaxim#0778
I've never had a problem on Linux but I believe it might be troublesome on Windows for instance


[09/24/2021 7:08 PM] pragmaxim#0778

what is the best way to check if your node is running on testnet or mainnet (via the API). I'm thinking to use the /info endpoint.


[09/29/2021 4:27 PM] Apextheory#6577
I am trying to fix the issue where the UI points to mainnet explorer if you click a testnet address.  it happens in a few other places too.


[09/29/2021 4:52 PM] Apextheory#6577
looks like I should add a "network" field to the NodeInfo class

@ghostrider you shouldn't have all those `null`'s, are you sure the node picks up the config file alright?


[10/12/2021 11:04 AM] kushti#0978
Likely config is not read, your node is not downloading and writing data

Yeah that is the one I am using normally


[10/26/2021 1:13 PM] glasgowm#9381
You can derive it but i think you need the private key. Why were they not generated with the default derivation path?


[10/26/2021 1:16 PM] Luivatra#9076
I did not generate them, it is just the changeaddress that was suddenly different, I can see now it happended when I switched to 4.0.15


[10/26/2021 1:16 PM] Luivatra#9076
you can see the change address under /wallet/status


[10/26/2021 1:25 PM] Luivatra#9076
So I have 2 nodes, one local and one on server, the one on the server was 4.0.15 the local one was 4.0.14. Both did not have the address in the list, but I could see the unspent boxes on the 4.0.15 one under /wallet/boxes/unspent and not on the local one. Updated local to 4.0.15 and now the address is listed under addresses there. I am mega confused but I think I recovered it... just cannot see the pool tokens that are on that address on the explorer so doing a wallet rescan


[10/26/2021 10:02 PM] kushti#0978
we're investigating


[10/26/2021 10:09 PM] Luivatra#9076
All assets and coins showed up after a rescan. So there is no issue right now, just confused about what happened. I did have that early version of 4.0.15 where swagger wasnt working

I see, need to check

[10/28/2021 4:21 PM] Wii#9265

  "detail": "Ask timed out on [Actor[akka://ergoref/user/$c#1415017220]] after [5000 ms]. Message of type [org.ergoplatform.nodeView.ErgoReadersHolder$GetReaders$]. A typical reason for `AskTimeoutException` is that the recipient actor didn't send a reply."

[10/28/2021 4:35 PM] Wii#9265
Oh nevermind.


[10/28/2021 4:35 PM] Wii#9265
I found a solution:


[10/28/2021 4:35 PM] Wii#9265
I made a new node and copied .ergo\wallet to it


[10/28/2021 4:36 PM] Wii#9265
Although now it only reports 1 ERG instead of 4 in my wallet. Though that might be due to needing to sync?


[10/28/2021 9:39 PM] Tyra#9992
The coins are accounted for on the network right... So any wallet with the same address and keys should be able to access them right?


[10/30/2021 11:40 AM] Wii#9265
I think so. Oh well, I'm gonna let the node sync

Hi! I initialize a ergo Node Wallet with Re-store wallet option with the 4.0.15 update. I'm using that address to receive $erg from mining. I received 1 $erg today from mining but it doesn't update my balance in the Node Wallet. When I look the address in the explorer I did see the 1 $erg updated balance. There's anything wrong with the sync of my Node Wallet?


[11/01/2021 8:16 PM] Wii#9265

[11/13/2021 12:15 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yeh, you can fix it but should just pass over it

Delete history and state in the hidden folder .ergo and resync


[11/13/2021 12:26 AM] CypherPet#3447
Will this resync everything from block0? My node running on Docker+WSL2 on windows 10 is kind of a pain to manage.. sometimes it's all good, sometimes it takes forever to resync after a week off. It's been stuck for about 20 minutes at "syncing" and "Send message spec" , "recieve message spec" without increasing the current height value.. I ctrl+c out of it and restarted it and now it's  syncing at around 0 to 10 blocks per seconds. is this normal behavior?


[11/13/2021 9:26 AM] glasgowm#9381
Yep, I don't use it because of this. Hopefully improved in future versions

I'm still struggling, you have a `docker-compose`?


[11/21/2021 11:39 AM] andee#4722
What part are you struggling with? I am not using docker but it should run using the same cmd that is in the readme of the node


[11/21/2021 11:40 AM] andee#4722

so you're using docker or not?


[11/21/2021 1:19 PM] andee#4722
Podman, but it should work just as well on docker. Used up to 1GB of swap far out in the sync


[11/21/2021 1:20 PM] andee#4722

Did you compile the node using the changes I did?


[11/21/2021 1:44 PM] andee#4722
Remember you have to do a clean shutdown of the node you are copying from, copying while running will most likely result in corruption


[11/21/2021 2:38 PM] andee#4722
I don't know if a transfer from x86 will work without compiling with leveldbjni-aarch64

[11/25/2021 8:52 PM] Crypto Cream#4657
there's several issues which have made the node almost impossible to run on the Pi, could there be some more attention on making it compatible? Feel the Pi is a powerful tool for decentralisation


[11/25/2021 9:10 PM] glasgowm#9381
I put a fan on my Pi and it's syncing fine now - but think v5 will make Pis infeasible

hmm, let me know if it makes it


[11/25/2021 9:25 PM] Crypto Cream#4657
why infeasible?


[11/25/2021 9:35 PM] andee#4722
temperature was never a problem for me, but I did also not have this problem from initial sync when I synced it the last time. has been syncing fine after adjusting penalty so those two nodes got blacklisted though

It's for if you want a wallet


[11/25/2021 11:10 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yeah, you can use swagger to generate the API key and then issue tx straight from cli if desired


[11/26/2021 4:01 AM] andee#4722
if the server is on your lan you can bind to 0.0.0.0 (make sure 9053 is closed externally), if remote server wireguard or ssh tunnel. without an API key anyone would be able to shut down public nodes

Hello, does anyone have an example ergo.conf for ergo-x..x.x.jar that had overriding log file settings... The defaults I wish to change like putting the log on separate drive. Googled but found no hits. Any help appreciated.


[12/01/2021 11:39 AM] glasgowm#9381
You don't set the logs on the .conf file, you can manage it in docker or do something with the output in terminal ie this would save it to `server.log` in the same dir

```
java -jar -Xmx3G ergo.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf > server.log 2>&1 & 
```

Node keeps crashing on me.  Syncs for a few minutes, maybe an hour and then stops. Here's a paste bin of the message, where it looks like it starts the error, though I'm not truly sure.  Ubuntu 18 if that matter

I'm not familiar with nohup? Any resources for me to figure that process out? Thanks kushti!


[12/02/2021 8:22 PM] kushti#0978
I'm doing just 

nohup ./start.sh &

on servers, where start.sh contains

java -jar -Xmx3G ergo-4.0.16.jar  --mainnet -c mainnet.conf


[12/02/2021 9:04 PM] wileyyy#7785
I'll admit though I am using linux on this machine that I don't really know what I'm doing.  The nohup ./start.sh & command was a bit confusing and I couldn't get the argument to work, but running 
java -jar -Xmx3G ergo-4.0.16.jar  --mainnet -c ergo.conf
seems to be working.  Blocks are syncing quickly and the wallet API worked and my wallet password was accepted. This machine is pretty old but I'm hoping it there aren't anymore issues.  Thank you Kushti ‚ù§Ô∏è


[12/02/2021 10:10 PM] glasgowm#9381
nohup - no hang up, it sends the output to a file so it wouldn't have shown in terminal


[12/02/2021 10:12 PM] wileyyy#7785
The output gets registered in the log file anyways right, so this just keeps the terminal less cluttered? Any hints on what the addition of "-Xmx3G" means? Google provided me with no results. 

BTW I'm at block 300000 sonar with no issues *fingers crossed*


[12/02/2021 10:13 PM] wileyyy#7785
So far *


[12/02/2021 10:24 PM] glasgowm#9381
Xmx3G sets the java heap max memory size to 3GB

nohups purpose is to execute a command such that it ignores the HUP (hangup) signal. ie = does not stop when you log-out/timeout.


[12/02/2021 10:25 PM] glasgowm#9381

Haha, it is a PIA - I've spent a bit of time making it a 1-liner, but not fully tested on windows yet. Lots of spam attacks in the past few weeks which has made syncing harder.

[12/05/2021 10:53 AM] g_w87#1147
haha ok great, will do that


[12/05/2021 10:53 AM] g_w87#1147
sleep mode is disabled


[12/05/2021 10:53 AM] g_w87#1147
ok so it syncs for 12 hourts and then finally stops


[12/05/2021 10:54 AM] glasgowm#9381
Normally it just needs a restart to kick it back into action. I *think* the spam attacks kinda mess up the height briefly - but when you do that, you need to usually kill the process/port manually before you start it back up. - or you'll get the `readers not ready (None,None,None)` error


[12/05/2021 10:55 AM] glasgowm#9381
```
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:9053/node/shutdown" -H "api_key: hellomyd"
```

for a safe shutdown I believe


[12/05/2021 10:56 AM] g_w87#1147
yes


[12/05/2021 10:57 AM] g_w87#1147
run this in powershell to boot it back up?


[12/05/2021 10:57 AM] g_w87#1147
hellomyd üòé


[12/05/2021 10:58 AM] g_w87#1147
yes that makes sense!


[12/05/2021 10:58 AM] g_w87#1147
ive had a few times where it says im missing blocks or headers or something and my logs or data is missing history and is almost corrupted


[12/05/2021 10:58 AM] g_w87#1147
and i just have to start over


[12/05/2021 10:59 AM] g_w87#1147
ill start over with your additional code added to my .cong


[12/05/2021 10:59 AM] g_w87#1147
.conf*


[12/05/2021 11:02 AM] g_w87#1147
just kicked it off again with your new lines of code added


[12/05/2021 11:16 AM] g_w87#1147
how long should it take to fully sync if i just started from scratch?


[12/05/2021 1:48 PM] glasgowm#9381
nah that's if you want to shut down the node safely


[12/05/2021 1:48 PM] glasgowm#9381
Did you set a heap size?


[12/05/2021 1:49 PM] glasgowm#9381
Depends, about 12-24hrs if all goes ok.


[12/05/2021 1:49 PM] g_w87#1147
Not sure what that is, I just copied your code and added it to conf file


[12/05/2021 1:49 PM] g_w87#1147
Running fine now


[12/05/2021 1:49 PM] glasgowm#9381
ah right ok


[12/05/2021 1:49 PM] g_w87#1147
Will report back in 12-24


[12/05/2021 1:50 PM] glasgowm#9381
You run it like this

```
java -jar -Xmx2G ergo.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf > server.log 2>&1 & 
```

`2G` = 2GB of ram, this can be any number depending on your comp's specs. 2-3GB is recommended but I have mine set to 14GB, and 2GB on my Pi


[12/05/2021 1:51 PM] g_w87#1147
In the conf file?


[12/05/2021 1:51 PM] g_w87#1147
Or that‚Äôs how I call the jar


[12/05/2021 1:52 PM] g_w87#1147
Like the new and improved way to call jar now that I have your additional lines of code


[12/05/2021 1:55 PM] g_w87#1147
I have 8gb ram mini computer dedicated to node - what should I set that to instead of 2?


[12/05/2021 2:17 PM] g_w87#1147
done! just restarted the node.. thanks for the help


[12/05/2021 3:06 PM] glasgowm#9381
that's how you call the jar - you set the avail memory


[12/05/2021 3:07 PM] glasgowm#9381
6 if dedi, or whatever it'll let you ^^


[12/05/2021 3:26 PM] g_w87#1147
6 worked


[12/05/2021 3:27 PM] g_w87#1147
6 worked... does your additional code silence powershell so it doesnt look like the matrix?


[12/05/2021 3:27 PM] g_w87#1147
this is great, really appreciate the support


[12/05/2021 3:35 PM] g_w87#1147
once my node syncs... is there any problem with just letting run continuously?


[12/05/2021 3:46 PM] glasgowm#9381
yeh it pipes it into server.log and takes any error/warn's out into error.log


[12/05/2021 3:47 PM] glasgowm#9381
nope!


[12/05/2021 3:49 PM] g_w87#1147
Good stuff, hopefully this seals the deal


[12/05/2021 8:51 PM] glasgowm#9381
Is there any downside to enabling this? Other than presumably not having access to transactions before that block?

```
# Skip validation of transactions in the mainnet before block 417,792 (in v1 blocks).
# Block 417,792 is checkpointed by the protocol (so its UTXO set as well).
# The node still applying transactions to UTXO set and so checks UTXO set digests for each block.
skipV1TransactionsValidation = true
```


[12/06/2021 9:52 PM] g_w87#1147
Still syncing over 24 hours later‚Ä¶ should I let it keep going?


[12/06/2021 10:08 PM] glasgowm#9381
Go to /info - what is the height at?


[12/06/2021 10:10 PM] g_w87#1147
I don‚Äôt have an info folder, but ergo node interface says 6600


[12/06/2021 10:11 PM] g_w87#1147
I don‚Äôt have an info folder, but ergo node interface says 6600 and is not changing


[12/06/2021 10:14 PM] glasgowm#9381
http://localhost:9053/info


[12/06/2021 10:14 PM] glasgowm#9381
If it's not changing then try a restart


[12/06/2021 10:15 PM] glasgowm#9381
If that doesn't work check the logs for any WARN/ERRORs - if you can't see any you need to delete `.ergo` and resync


[12/06/2021 10:33 PM] g_w87#1147
Is there a proper way to restart or just close out an try again?


[12/06/2021 10:38 PM] glasgowm#9381
```

[12/06/2021 10:38 PM] g_w87#1147
Ok thx


[12/06/2021 10:40 PM] g_w87#1147
Notepad++ wouldn‚Äôt open server.log because it was too big - what program do you use to open and read?


[12/06/2021 10:43 PM] andee#4722
tail and less are my gotos, you would need cygwin or use wsl to make use of those on windows though


[12/06/2021 11:31 PM] g_w87#1147
Ok thanks


[12/06/2021 11:32 PM] g_w87#1147
Seems like I just need to switch to Mint from windows to make this work


[12/06/2021 11:32 PM] g_w87#1147
Which isn‚Äôt a big deal


[12/07/2021 12:06 AM] soysor#6001
I had similar issues on windows when using docker/wsl, when running the node outside of any virtualization it sync'd way faster and without crashes


[12/07/2021 12:09 AM] g_w87#1147
I‚Äôm not compiling anything on my own, just following the directions from ergo‚Äôs blog post + Glasgow‚Äôs modifications


[12/07/2021 12:10 AM] g_w87#1147
You think I should do anything differently?


[12/08/2021 12:53 PM] kushti#0978
sorry that was my node running an experimental version of code


[12/08/2021 12:53 PM] kushti#0978
now should be fixed

[12/08/2021 11:40 PM] g_w87#1147
wow it worked and my node is finally sync'd... thanks for the help!! now onto ergo stats. 

your additional code in the ergo.txt file + the modifications to the powershell code should def be added to the node article thats on the site!


[12/09/2021 4:51 PM] Telefragged#8068
I'm having some memory issues when syncing the node running on docker. I've tried setting the java heap size to 4G via the `_JAVA_OPTIONS` environment variable (`-e _JAVA_OPTIONS="-Xmx4G"`) but that didn't seem to help, only made it consume the extra memory before it eventually threw the heap memory exception. My machine has plenty of memory available but I'm running docker via WSL2 so not sure if that is known to cause issues? Anyone have any experience with this?


[12/09/2021 4:53 PM] andee#4722
anything unusual in the log before it happens?


[12/09/2021 4:53 PM] andee#4722
I have synced with 1G heap on a pi, 3 should be enough under regular circumstances


[12/09/2021 4:54 PM] Telefragged#8068
Difficult to find anything in particular, only a bunch of block confirmations. I restarted the node but if it happens again I can send the full stacktrace

[12/09/2021 9:32 PM] ArqTras#1644
y i have 16 GB of 64 GB on system


[12/09/2021 9:33 PM] ArqTras#1644
well doing as you reccomend but it will sync again


[12/09/2021 9:33 PM] andee#4722
are you sure? startup says you have less

[12/09/2021 9:34 PM] andee#4722
that might be be because of the flag, but it does not match 16GB

ok change to 4 GB no issue


[12/09/2021 9:35 PM] ArqTras#1644
better for me :d


[12/09/2021 9:35 PM] andee#4722
because it will use more than 4, the setting is only for heap


[12/09/2021 9:35 PM] ArqTras#1644
ok


[12/09/2021 9:36 PM] andee#4722
from the looks of your log your database was corrupted, deleting those two folders will start sync from scratch


[12/09/2021 9:37 PM] ArqTras#1644
y it is


[12/09/2021 9:37 PM] andee#4722
repeated Got GetReaders request in state (None,None,None,None) and historyReader not initialized when processing syncInfo is a sign of this


[12/09/2021 9:38 PM] ArqTras#1644
y stuck at 600K block


[12/09/2021 9:39 PM] ArqTras#1644
well lets see how it goes , there is no bootstrap or shared repo to clone current bc?


[12/09/2021 9:40 PM] andee#4722
looks like there was 2 4.0.17 nodes in that log, those were the ones I had to get blacklisted to be able to sync


[12/09/2021 9:41 PM] andee#4722
if you have someplace I could upload one, but there is no download available


[12/09/2021 9:43 PM] ArqTras#1644
wetransfer.com but its only for desktop


[12/09/2021 9:43 PM] ArqTras#1644
nvm it is syncing so will wait a day more


[12/09/2021 9:43 PM] ArqTras#1644
mayby less


[12/09/2021 9:44 PM] ArqTras#1644
is there more documentation related to samples for ergo.config


[12/09/2021 9:44 PM] andee#4722
it should be pretty fast with with a decent cpu


[12/09/2021 9:44 PM] ArqTras#1644
like use priority node or something


[12/09/2021 9:44 PM] ArqTras#1644
30 k headers height atm


[12/09/2021 9:45 PM] ArqTras#1644
i started diging in to wiki and so on


[12/09/2021 9:45 PM] andee#4722
what do you mean by priority node?

Just wanted to add that my node seemingly got stuck around block 600000 but recovered after a while using the stricter penalty settings from andee


[12/09/2021 9:54 PM] ArqTras#1644
getting headers is not and issue


[12/09/2021 9:55 PM] ArqTras#1644
problem i had was with validation or dunno how to name it


[12/09/2021 9:55 PM] ArqTras#1644
when block height is presented in panel


[12/09/2021 10:23 PM] ArqTras#1644

[12/10/2021 8:25 PM] ArqTras#1644
same error with docker


[12/10/2021 8:26 PM] ArqTras#1644
so funny its only on vps , on metal server no issues


[12/10/2021 9:21 PM] andee#4722
this is on the latest release? never seen those crashes before


[12/10/2021 9:22 PM] andee#4722
are you running it using a service outside of the vps too?


[12/10/2021 9:31 PM] ArqTras#1644
ok nvm insetad of 2 G shoudl use 2048m


[12/10/2021 9:31 PM] ArqTras#1644

hmm, I am using `    -e MAX_HEAP=2G \`


[12/10/2021 9:34 PM] ArqTras#1644
for docker ?


[12/10/2021 9:34 PM] ArqTras#1644
im running it from bash


[12/10/2021 9:36 PM] andee#4722
yeah, also used 2G when I added -Xmx manually to JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS


[12/10/2021 10:26 PM] ArqTras#1644

[12/10/2021 10:26 PM] ArqTras#1644
testing now


[12/12/2021 12:17 PM] ArqTras#1644

When using Ergo Node's "deriveNextKey", it derives keys, that have already previously been derived from Yoroi. Is there any way I can change this to derive new keys only?


[12/12/2021 2:43 PM] andee#4722
@kushti might offer some help


[12/12/2021 2:45 PM] andee#4722
it adds 1 to the index for each time your derive, so you will get the same addresses as in yoroi until you pass the index you have in yoroi. you can derive keys with a custom path using `deriveKey`


[12/12/2021 7:06 PM] TikTokTok#7410
what is the collateral and profitability of running a node? I just want to know if it will cover VPS costs.

[12/12/2021 7:25 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
unless you are running a pool, no revenue to cover your cost


[12/12/2021 7:37 PM] g_w87#1147
hey, my node crashed and this is the error log... any idea whats going on i cant seem to keep my node up for too long

should i give that a go?


[12/12/2021 7:48 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
I would.  Also what java version are you using?

[12/12/2021 7:59 PM] g_w87#1147

that works for my nodes


[12/12/2021 8:06 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
its very process and memory intensive during block sync. then you can scale down afterwards


[12/12/2021 8:06 PM] g_w87#1147
ok


[12/12/2021 8:10 PM] g_w87#1147
i have an 8gb mini computer


[12/12/2021 8:10 PM] g_w87#1147
and dedicate 6gb to the node in my .conf file


[12/12/2021 8:10 PM] g_w87#1147
^this is wrong, dedicate 6gb in the powershell script


[12/12/2021 8:14 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
only need 4 GB heap Xmx, dont need 6 or 8. Actually didnt work well for me


[12/12/2021 8:16 PM] g_w87#1147
haha ok!


[12/12/2021 8:16 PM] g_w87#1147
let me change that to 4gb and refresh


[12/12/2021 8:16 PM] g_w87#1147
no i dont ill paste in what i have


[12/12/2021 8:18 PM] g_w87#1147
i modified my .conf file and updated the powershell code after speaking with glasgow

[12/12/2021 9:41 PM] ArqTras#1644
and still got same issue


[12/12/2021 10:26 PM] andee#4722
@ArqTras can you try deleting history and state folders, then try a resync with `mining = false` ?


[12/12/2021 10:27 PM] andee#4722
and m or g does not matter in heap, it supports both


[12/12/2021 10:27 PM] ArqTras#1644
well lest see


[12/12/2021 10:28 PM] ArqTras#1644
started with false

limited memory to 1024


[12/12/2021 10:28 PM] ArqTras#1644

[12/12/2021 10:31 PM] ArqTras#1644
i try this sync for at last few days with many different configurations


[12/12/2021 10:31 PM] ArqTras#1644
is there a way to limit process usage to let it be 4 cpus ?


[12/12/2021 10:31 PM] ArqTras#1644
i mean cores


[12/12/2021 10:31 PM] andee#4722
do you have the node output from before core dump?


[12/12/2021 10:33 PM] andee#4722
-XX:ActiveProcessorCount=4


[12/12/2021 10:33 PM] ArqTras#1644
y thought like that

popping my melatonin now, will soon be crashing


[12/12/2021 10:36 PM] andee#4722
how long did the node run before crashing?


[12/12/2021 10:37 PM] ArqTras#1644
different time


[12/12/2021 10:37 PM] ArqTras#1644
with low memory works better


[12/12/2021 10:37 PM] ArqTras#1644
problems starting when headers are synced and validation start


[12/12/2021 10:39 PM] andee#4722
I noticed that the latest version tried to assemble candidates before the node is fully synced, it maxed out my cpu and sync was slow


[12/12/2021 10:39 PM] ArqTras#1644
aand crashed


[12/12/2021 10:39 PM] andee#4722
damn


[12/12/2021 10:40 PM] andee#4722
could you termbin the output from start to crash?


[12/12/2021 10:41 PM] ArqTras#1644
thats normal log


[12/12/2021 10:42 PM] ArqTras#1644

and so interesting i did try also in docker with same issue


[12/12/2021 10:55 PM] ArqTras#1644
and log above is from 17 v its the same with 11


[12/12/2021 10:56 PM] andee#4722
docker image should run just fine, should be nothing else then jdk needed for running jar either


[12/12/2021 10:57 PM] andee#4722
could it be a java problem with having cores on different cpu's?


[12/12/2021 10:58 PM] ArqTras#1644
im actually syncing testnet on other server (metal one) without issues


[12/13/2021 12:12 PM] ArqTras#1644
does node 4.0.10 is good enuf to run own pool ?


[12/13/2021 12:12 PM] ArqTras#1644
looks like most stable for now


[12/13/2021 1:28 PM] alexandru#0679
after 5 fucking days of downloading the node and trying to install now it got stuck at height 500k and something,  i close the damn thing, I open it again and now I got this! It's almost a month  without accesing my erg wallet cause it's none working, my patience is gone. How should I solve this ? wait another week to download the node ?

A few fixes - changed ‚ÄúXmx6G‚Äù to ‚ÄúXmx4G‚Äù or ‚ÄúXmx4096m‚Äù


[12/13/2021 1:45 PM] g_w87#1147
Per @AllCloudy | GetBlok.io 4G is sweet spot


[12/13/2021 1:46 PM] g_w87#1147
I was also getting that error a lot when I was trying to run the node from my ssd external hard drive, Switched it to C drive


[12/13/2021 1:48 PM] g_w87#1147
And @glasgowm had another suggestion which was add a few lines of code to the .conf file and add the ‚Äú>server.log 2>&1‚Äù to the powershell code


[12/13/2021 1:49 PM] alexandru#0679
what lines ?


[12/13/2021 1:49 PM] g_w87#1147
@alexandru this is what I added to end of .conf file

Good luck - I‚Äôm by no means an expert but my node is syncing quickly right now and I spent 2 months battling with it


[12/13/2021 1:53 PM] pragmaxim#0778
it works on Linux but I often find people who can't sync on Windows or Mac

NTFS is not the most reliable filesystem, I would recommend running the node in WSL


[12/13/2021 2:23 PM] andee#4722
but as long as disk and ram in your system is ok, windows should work too


[12/13/2021 2:24 PM] alexandru#0679
if this doesn't work i'll try WSL,  thank you

what does that mean?!?!


[12/13/2021 2:53 PM] g_w87#1147
considering going the wsl path for chain grabber after my node syncs


[12/13/2021 3:14 PM] andee#4722
to not use NTFS, use the ext4 partition that belongs to the wsl instance


[12/13/2021 3:24 PM] g_w87#1147
great thanks (will google what that means üò¨ )


[12/13/2021 3:26 PM] andee#4722
using the windows partitions also causes (at least it did when I tried it a year ago) a lot of slowdown

if you stay inside your home folder in wsl you are good

51.79.229.232 looks like a problematic node, had to revert to aggressive blacklist settings

how'd you do that?


[12/13/2021 5:42 PM] g_w87#1147
sorry more appropriate question, is that something we need to account for in our nodes or nah?


[12/13/2021 6:41 PM] andee#4722
I use these settings: ```    network {

    # Misbehaving peer penalty score will not be increased withing this time interval,
    # unless permanent penalty is applied
    penaltySafeInterval = 20.seconds

    # Max penalty score peer can accumulate before being banned
    penaltyScoreThreshold = 5
    maxDeliveryChecks = 4

     }
```


[12/13/2021 6:41 PM] andee#4722
within scorex{}


[12/13/2021 7:26 PM] abchris#8522
Does peer discovery rely on 9053 (public api) or does it go through 9030?
Trying to get a snapshot of all active nodes.


[12/13/2021 7:46 PM] andee#4722
9030 is P2P port


[12/13/2021 7:49 PM] abchris#8522
Thanks. So 9053 does not need to be open to be discoverable, makes sense now I think of it.


[12/13/2021 7:49 PM] abchris#8522
Are you aware of any tooling that crawls the network to find all nodes?


[12/13/2021 7:50 PM] andee#4722
9053 should not be accessible from the outsideüëç


[12/13/2021 7:50 PM] abchris#8522
Guess I'll have to dive into Scala


[12/13/2021 7:51 PM] andee#4722
not any that I know of, would have to check out the protocol. depending on what you aim to do, there is an API call to get IP addresses of other known nodes


[12/13/2021 7:53 PM] abchris#8522
Right, but that's on 9053. I did query for connected nodes to all public 9053's I could find and ended up with 82 unique ip's. Hence my question. I guess doing it the protocol way through 9030 will be more reliable.


[12/13/2021 7:56 PM] andee#4722
is that 82 nodes with 9053 exposed or only 82 peers from the API?


[12/13/2021 7:57 PM] andee#4722
grepped my node: `19:52:12.729 INFO  [ctor.default-dispatcher-5] s.c.n.peer.PeerManager - 225 peers read from the database`


[12/13/2021 7:59 PM] abchris#8522
Found 11 public nodes and queried their `/peers/connected`


[12/13/2021 7:59 PM] abchris#8522
Yields 82 unique ip's


[12/13/2021 7:59 PM] abchris#8522
`/peers/all` yields much more of course


[12/13/2021 8:00 PM] abchris#8522
I just wanted to confirm the nodes were not relying on public api to discover each other, which you did üôÇ


[12/13/2021 8:01 PM] andee#4722
if you are looking for all, why go for only connected? I got 205 unique ip's by checking all on my node, the most I have seen on startup is +700 peers


[12/13/2021 8:02 PM] andee#4722
aah, I thought you were trying to get the IP of all nodes


[12/13/2021 8:02 PM] abchris#8522
Because I want a snapshot of active nodes. Could crawl using all to find more public nodes possibly, then query their connected...


[12/13/2021 8:03 PM] abchris#8522
But will see if I can cook something up closer to the protocol.


[12/13/2021 8:03 PM] andee#4722
not being connected != inactive from my knowledge though, most nodes run with the standard 30 (?) peer limit


[12/13/2021 8:05 PM] abchris#8522
Ah, that's good to know! One more reason to use the actual protocol.


[12/13/2021 8:05 PM] andee#4722
maybe just faking the handshake could be enought to query peers from all to confirm that they are online

Great resource, thanks!


[12/13/2021 8:10 PM] andee#4722
I saw that there was some discussion about this part of the wiki being outdated, should be searchable on the server. think it was related to capabilities. but that might be irrelevant to just get a handshake going


[12/13/2021 8:13 PM] andee#4722
might do a dump and fire up wireshark tomorrow, curious about how many nodes there are out there. havent checked, but if it is possible to get all known nodes through the P2P protocol it will be much easier to get a mapping


[12/13/2021 8:15 PM] abchris#8522
My goal is to track it over time and add that to ergo watch. Thanks for your help, you're a goldmine of info.


[12/13/2021 8:20 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
You can get a list of nodes in the swagger api of your node.


[12/13/2021 8:22 PM] abchris#8522
Yeh we were discussing that, but it‚Äôs not exhaustive and doesn‚Äôt tell wether nodes are online or not.


[12/13/2021 8:22 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
ah.  Yeah its weird and somewhat inefficient. A node will get that list and test connection to every single one


[12/13/2021 8:23 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
at least it seems from looking at logs


[12/13/2021 8:23 PM] abchris#8522
Guess i‚Äôll do the same then üôÇ


[12/13/2021 8:34 PM] andee#4722
I seriously doubt that there are just ~200 nodes online. I have seen +700 saved nodes on startup and my guess is that total node count is much larger than this


[12/13/2021 8:37 PM] kushti#0978
Port can be custom though


[12/13/2021 8:41 PM] abchris#8522
Indeed. One more reason to go the handshake route


[12/13/2021 8:47 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
There are lots of nodes out there that do not allow inbound connectivity.  This may be part of the metrics skew.  Honestly not clear how nodes discover eachother but I assume part of the p2p handshake process.  I mean, my nodes allow ZERO inbound connections originated from interwebs, so it has to be a handshake process. But handshake to who? someone has to start the handshake, so there must be public nodes which are internet facing on 9053


[12/13/2021 8:49 PM] andee#4722
9053 is API port, nodes communicate via 9030 (or custom port as kushti said). how is the node even keeping sync if you have blocked its ability to do P2P comms?


[12/13/2021 8:56 PM] andee#4722
so its not possible to do a handshake to your node, one would have to get your ip from a node you are already connected to


[12/13/2021 8:57 PM] andee#4722
which is exactly what me and abchris was talking about, using the protocol to talk to nodes to get their known peers without relying on nodes API to be exposed


[12/13/2021 9:48 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
That's a great point, regardless our nodes keep in sync successfully. How? great question.  It must be from outgoing p2p connection being initiated.  Versus allowing other nodes reaching to our nodes to initiate p2p. Which I suspect a large number of nodes out there are operating in similar fashion


[12/13/2021 9:49 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
So the bigger question - is there any detrimental behavior by not allowing 9030 inbound from big Internet?


[12/13/2021 10:36 PM] abchris#8522
Hmm, that would mean there is no way to crawl the whole network and handshake all nodes


[12/13/2021 11:00 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Probably not.


[12/14/2021 7:42 AM] andee#4722
I imagine it works the same way as a torrent client, that the node have to initiate connections to peers that are known to other nodes


[12/14/2021 7:49 AM] andee#4722
looks like 2miners have the p2p port exposed, my node is connected to two of their nodes. one at port 19030 the other at 9030

We are going to test opening port 9030 on testnet and run some vulnerability tests to see how it stands up.  May open up better p2p sync and block refresh if taht port is open.


[12/14/2021 5:45 PM] andee#4722
it might, torrenting also works without opening a port but it results in less seeders and speed

@andee  are you worried at all about facilitating people in launching DoS against nodes?   I suspect that is possible *now* but not sure how we can ensure protection against it in the future. Thinking Solana scenarios


[12/15/2021 5:15 PM] andee#4722
if someone wants to do that they don't really need any help from me, crawling nodes to get a list of unique IP's is the "norm" for trying to estimate number of active nodes in a network

True and I understand that.

Great Thankyou. Will it just be under one api key and password ?


[12/22/2021 6:35 PM] andee#4722
The new address is derived from your private key, which is derived from your mnemonic (seed). Make sure that you use deriveNextKey, not deriveKey since it by default uses a custom path and does not increment key index automatically

@AllCloudy | GetBlok.io  nice!. I am curious what is your setup for developmnet? you have a local tiny machine as a node running all time? or you just spawn your node in your development machine whenever you are going to test something?

for us, we just have a dedicated server with testnet node and stratum for testing our code.

openjdk 11


[12/27/2021 9:34 AM] pragmaxim#0778
@andee what ergo version is that ? Did you build the to-be-4.0.17 yourself?


[12/27/2021 9:38 AM] pragmaxim#0778
this exception used to cause the the syncing troubles ... so I made sure it won't anymore ... however I have not troubleshot the parsing problem yet


[12/27/2021 9:39 AM] andee#4722
I believe the log I posted is from a v4.0.16.2 node, not mine though. There has been a number of people that are unable to sync their nodes and the common thing has been that is has been failing to parse modifiers from 159.89.116.15 (which runs 4.0.17) before it shuts down without any alerts or runs out of heap


[12/27/2021 10:10 AM] pragmaxim#0778
mm, invalid modifier is coming even from 4.0.16 nodes, it must be some PR from 4.0.16+ releases perhaps


[12/27/2021 10:32 AM] HelixEvo#2120
This must be on fully syncing nodes from scratch, else there would be bigger problems?

[12/27/2021 12:40 PM] andee#4722
My 4.0.16 node that were shutting down is running on Linux, it only happened on initial sync and only after receiving modifiers from 4.0.17 node(s) for a little while. Testing again now, but has not received anything from '159.89.116.15' yet


[12/27/2021 12:41 PM] pragmaxim#0778
because invalid modifiers were causing a restart of a syncing Actor on 4.0.16 .. the node was choking


[12/27/2021 12:42 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Why are there some 169.254.x.x in logs as peers. That‚Äôs odd


[12/27/2021 12:42 PM] pragmaxim#0778
@andee 4.0.17 just reports that invalid modifier


[12/27/2021 12:44 PM] andee#4722
but this only happens when receiving modifiers from a 4.0.17 node though. happened right after connecting with it: https://termbin.com/6qxf5

yeah perhaps one of these PRs here https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/pull/1490


[12/27/2021 12:50 PM] pragmaxim#0778
the most suspicious thing is this https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/pull/1492 cc @knizhnik  ... as it is the only one related to serialization/deserialization ... maybe for this change to work it needs two 4.0.17 peers, but it does not work with 4.0.16 - 4.0.17

You can change it with the swagger page


[12/28/2021 3:26 PM] Lucas-Gaming#2484
If I understand what you want you can change it with this endpoint `/wallet/updateChangeAddress`


[12/28/2021 3:27 PM] Lucas-Gaming#2484
You can pass your main address in the body request


[12/28/2021 3:27 PM] Lucas-Gaming#2484
No need


[12/28/2021 3:27 PM] Lucas-Gaming#2484
Just check with `/wallet/status`


[12/28/2021 3:28 PM] Lucas-Gaming#2484

if you created it a long time ago, try `/deriveKey` with the path that is there as an example. Also, if you used a mnemonic password in addition to wallet password, you need to restore using that password

Well duh, where else do you download it from. Again, thought it was an announcement here on discord is all. I've been on 4.0.12 for a long time now. And nothing in the node running says "Hey... You need to update!" and if it does it didn't make it clear enough if you are like me who starts it then minimizes it.


[12/28/2021 5:33 PM] andee#4722
there is a node still running v3.3.6 out there, no need to alert users about updates really


[12/28/2021 5:35 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
They should ban nodes that are older like that


[12/28/2021 5:36 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
how do you expect the network to evolve if nodes are never being updated


[12/28/2021 5:37 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
now, the update process should, long term, be self updating.  Having to update jar files is not really efficient.  but not sure if its ever feasible.


[12/28/2021 5:51 PM] andee#4722
Why? A person running an old node that still works is better than not having one extra node


[12/28/2021 5:52 PM] andee#4722
If I were running a pool I would not want the node to do updates by itself. Not for regular usage either


[12/28/2021 6:22 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273

[12/28/2021 7:02 PM] DishBrain#1197
Forgive my ignorance, or if this has been asked before.  If I set up a full node on a windows machine, and mine from it as well, is there a way to point a HiveOS rig at that node on the windows machine(on the same local network) to solo mine along with it?


[12/28/2021 8:29 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
You have to setup a stratum to handle connection from miner.  Stratum connects to your node


[12/28/2021 8:29 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
There are a few open source options out there including ergos

Yep I see them too.


[12/29/2021 6:12 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Maybe node is binding to local interface


[12/29/2021 6:13 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Most nodes are not public facing I think so the local address is not the public address


[12/29/2021 6:13 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Is there a setting for node config to set the public address?


[12/29/2021 9:07 PM] andee#4722
yep, you find it in https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.conf


[12/29/2021 10:25 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Is there a way the process then can purge any 169.254.0.0/16 existing in the peer db on service start instead of relying on people to config the node and set a declared address? Or purge any private ranges on startup? Just thinking out loud.


[12/29/2021 11:08 PM] andee#4722
There is always a way üôÇ I have been getting local IP's back when running a crawler from node to node too


[12/29/2021 11:48 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Thanks for this very helpful.  Updating our nodes to declare some things.  Unfortunately won‚Äôt get rid of non-routable addresses being advertised


[12/30/2021 12:34 AM] andee#4722
I don't think it matters much though, the node tries to connect and if there is no response within 1 second it tries some other peer. It would be easy to add a check for this, but then nodes in private networks wont advertise each other etc. without adding more logic to it


[12/30/2021 9:27 AM] Andrius 11G#2333
can I copy ergo node folder to another computer?

what is basic mode?


[12/30/2021 11:21 AM] Andrius 11G#2333
I mean without any extra configuration just with basic setup


[12/30/2021 11:22 AM] andee#4722
minimal config is fine ```ergo {
  node {
    mining = false
  }
}```


[12/30/2021 11:23 AM] Andrius 11G#2333
yeah..I did that and added keyhash and recovered my wallet


[12/30/2021 11:26 AM] HelixEvo#2120
General question. I have a fully synced node now finally with mining = false. If I now set that to mining = true, then would I have to re sync or download any extra data?


[12/30/2021 11:28 AM] andee#4722
No, it will be ready to go right away


[12/30/2021 11:28 AM] andee#4722
should be anyway


[12/30/2021 11:29 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Setting mining to true then just binds some extra ports or something I guess?


[12/30/2021 11:29 AM] andee#4722
you can copy the whole .ergo folder + config, should be no need to recover if you already had the wallet initialized

Hey peeps, not sure if I'm sharing anything new but here's my (painful) experience with setting up a node on my mac
Macbook pro 2018 13' - 16gb ram - i5
java version 17
macOS Monterey
ergo-4.0.16.2

The program probably has a memory leak somewhere. In several tries, it would always crash validating modifiers, around height 400k-600k like this:
o.e.n.state.UtxoState - Valid modifier with header -hash- and emission box Some(-hash-) applied to UtxoState at height -whatever-

When I tried to re-run the program, it would get stuck in "historyreader not ready" or something like that, on a loop.

Ram *seemed* to be fine, the issue was the CPU. It would get almost 100% usage and the program seemed to get slower and slower, until the eventual crash. 

In a later try, I tried to interrupt the program when this happened (ctrl+C), but it straight up ignored it. It crashed a bit later (unsure if it's like the previous crashes or in response to my command). 

I started to suspect that these crashes were preventing the program from closing "history" or/and "state" properly, breaking them.

Today I tried to open and close the program on a loop every 50k heights. It worked, it's now fully synced üôè

You have had better success than me, most deny my connection üòÖ  But how did those local IP's get added? I have also encountered that, I just dont see how it can happen ü§î


[12/30/2021 11:27 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
NIce!


[12/31/2021 1:15 AM] Kurikun#6941
So, a node is running on a private IP address, and is making outbound connections to other nodes.  I connects to a node that is on an Internet IP, and the private node adds it to it's Peers list.  My app, or yours, connects to the public node and gets it's Peers list, which has the private IP guy.  And then I add that to the database.  That's my workflow at least!


[12/31/2021 1:18 AM] Kurikun#6941
Example, I'm running a node right now on WSL on my Windows machine, that is using IP 172.22.196.162.  It's connected to 30 other nodes, and I'm sure that my IP will get picked up the next time Node Spyder crawls one of those 30 nodes.


[12/31/2021 9:35 AM] andee#4722
I have only added peers after handshake, I forgot about version being included in peers message üòÖ  But some have still gotten in there for me, even though they are private IP's, and the name etc. does not match my own node. Will have to add a check for private IP's and set a breakpoint to see what is going on


[12/31/2021 2:11 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Is it not something to do with Upnp from the code notes? For ones that can‚Äôt use Upnp they have to state their public IP in config.


[12/31/2021 5:08 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Is there a way to define the node to publish the public facing address instead?


[12/31/2021 7:19 PM] Kurikun#6941
Yes, you use the declaredAddress field in scorex. network section of your conf file.  As in "172.22.196.162:9030".

[01/01/2022 2:14 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
trying to set the declared address to public internet ip, which is not the local ergo node interface ip


[01/01/2022 9:36 AM] andee#4722
you are setting port 9053, that is not the port you should be announcing to other peers


[01/01/2022 9:37 AM] andee#4722
Unless you bind to that port of course. Try 9030 and it should work


[01/01/2022 9:38 AM] andee#4722
You also have to bind to 0.0.0.0, not 127.0.0.1


[01/01/2022 7:36 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
I believe you mean i need to declare "bindAddress = "0.0.0.0:9030" correct?


[01/01/2022 7:40 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
and no luck, still have non matching to local interface address:

[01/04/2022 10:43 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
I've found that publishing your external IP for your node's P2P port has greatly increased the number of peers being sync'ed, and *knock on wood* eliminated common out of sync issues.  Also storage/disk space/disk speed has been something in the past that you need to consider, since P2P is written to disk so read/write I believe is of consideration.


[01/04/2022 10:49 PM] KJ#5769
Currently my node is v19, seems to max out at 30 peers.


[01/04/2022 10:50 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
You can change that. We have ours set at 200.   Put it under scorex section:

    network {
        maxConnections = X
    }


[01/04/2022 10:50 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273

[01/07/2022 6:25 PM] HelixEvo#2120
If most banks have ditched it, then I‚Äôd keep it. They are one of the worst in security when you dig down with their old systems.


[01/07/2022 6:26 PM] GunMuse#5469
they ditch it because it allows users to mimic keyboard controls not becuase of some left wing anti society movement


[01/07/2022 6:27 PM] GunMuse#5469
its best not to have it on a system for that reason


[01/07/2022 6:27 PM] HelixEvo#2120
They need to invest in some application security


[01/07/2022 6:27 PM] GunMuse#5469

Sorry but you‚Äôve lost me on what you are wanting to achieve. You saying you are looking to run a mining pool so people who want to mine but also give to the charity can use your pool? You then take a cut at pool level for the charity and the contributors also get a little kick back from the mining?


[01/07/2022 6:45 PM] GunMuse#5469
no kick backs but yes the charity becomes the pool owner


[01/07/2022 6:46 PM] GunMuse#5469
the individual lodges running a mining operation keep their funds. and the pool fee runs the national fund.


[01/07/2022 6:48 PM] GunMuse#5469
later we can tie other companies that work with charity into funds via the ergo to keep bank fees down as they stay in the network.

@GunMuse  If you are interested, DM me. I run GetBlok.io pool for ergo, have run through many of your questions when setting up our global architecture now in 5 countries. Lots of lessons learned when dealing with secure public facing web application.  Our infrastructure is pen tested daily, for emerging and existing threats.  Java is not your enemy, its all on the architecture design.


[01/07/2022 10:13 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Java is the code base for the reference client (node).  You dont have to expose the UI to anyone, nor should you.


[01/07/2022 10:15 PM] GunMuse#5469
@AllCloudy | GetBlok.io  thanks will do would be nice to have an experienced walk through


[01/08/2022 2:50 PM] Qu11n#6461
Is there any benefits of running a node apart from helping secure the network? Do you get paid for running one forinstance?


[01/08/2022 3:17 PM] Caike#9719
Had the same question and I believe the answer is no financial incentive unless you are mining.


[01/08/2022 3:19 PM] Qu11n#6461
well i am mining, would it the benefit me some by runningthe node?


[01/08/2022 3:44 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
No you do not get paid for running a node, like in flux.


[01/08/2022 3:45 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
You can mine to your node but you need a stratum and at that point you are solo mining, so unless you have lots of hash it‚Äôs just best to mine to a pool


[01/09/2022 10:56 AM] JCAP#8273
No, , but you can set one up and run bots for ergodex to win some fees (although right now you‚Äôre unlikely to win much, or anything at all, but someday it may get better)


[01/09/2022 1:41 PM] Ludovit#4957
hey guys we got some problems on our mining nodes, any ideas on how to "force" synchro of node without deleting all the blokchain data ?
We got nodes on 4.0.16 that "think" they are synchro but we cant force them to research new peers, even after reboot
Could we maybe delete /data/peers folder so that it researches new peers ? (we're like 20-30 blocks behind the mainnet)


[01/09/2022 2:32 PM] pragmaxim#0778
you might try starting the node with latest release https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/releases/tag/v4.0.20 ... the syncing problem was tackled recently


[01/09/2022 3:19 PM] Ludovit#4957
Allright many thanks for the quick anwser. We're already trying this. Updating an existing node didnt fix, so we're syncing from scratch.

Fast disk. Use SSDs and more CPU cores.

just updated to version 4.0.20.1 and I'm still running into issue trying to spin up a node. The issue happens when the height gets to 560,000ish the node will just crash. when I start it again the height will continue to grow but eventually it will still crash. I've been trying to get the node loaded for a while. started on a 2011 mac and then eventually moved to my new acer computer now. anyone have any advice?


[01/11/2022 7:58 AM] pragmaxim#0778

Make sure you have at least 16 gb memory and lots of cpu, and fast disk (ssd helps).  Java version matters, using java 11 has been solid.

We turned off the P2P port publishing to internet temporarily. But something is driving up cpu utilization hard on these nodes. We're scaling up the amount of cpu allocated, as historically the nodes dont do well when starved for cpu

Ours is at 667694 right now.. Closing off the P2P port and/or adding more cpu/mem solved getting hammered.  Not sure if its safe yet to open p2p port back up, but this time gonna be putting it behind another layer of protection

I can confirm, that node restarting every 10k blocks (after 600_000) helps to speed up syncing. Without that workaround it gets 1 block in  5+ seconds :(

[01/22/2022 10:53 PM] MGpai#4313
do I just set `mining = true`


[01/22/2022 10:53 PM] MGpai#4313
then connect my rig to the ip?


[01/23/2022 12:17 AM] Strider#6512
yes, use the local ip and port


[01/23/2022 12:17 AM] Strider#6512
It should be 127.0.0.1


[01/23/2022 12:18 AM] Strider#6512
Ensure that your node and wallet is fully synced


[01/23/2022 3:08 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
You need a stratum to connect to. Stratum connects to your node.


[01/23/2022 3:09 AM] MGpai#4313
even for just solo?


[01/23/2022 5:52 AM] blackinsecure#3693
yes


[01/23/2022 11:52 AM] ziggomatic#9335
solo mining will be unproductive unless you have considerable hash (multiple rigs)


[01/23/2022 4:46 PM] MGpai#4313
Thanks but I want to support decentralization


[01/23/2022 7:37 PM] DishBrain#1197
I spent a few hours the other day setting up a node and stratum server. 

I have T-Rex currently mining to it and getting valid shares, at least on the T-Rex console window.

If T-Rex shows valid shares, does that verify that everything is working as intended? or is there a way to verify on the Node, or Server console windows that things are correctly working?


[01/23/2022 7:48 PM] ziggomatic#9335
honorable. but you can still support decentralization and also your mining rigs by just mining to a smaller pre existing pool.


[01/23/2022 7:50 PM] ziggomatic#9335
you can leave your node running also, since they're not much of a burden


[01/23/2022 7:51 PM] DishBrain#1197
I think I just realized one thing, that I was working with the varDiff, and trying to dial in the difficulty so that I was seeing shares being submitted successfully.  But I should just be using the standard difficulty port so that it just uses the network difficulty. Then all I would see in the console is when a block is found, I would assume?


[01/23/2022 7:56 PM] DishBrain#1197
I get this when a worker connects though, not sure if it's anything to be concerned about:
Authorize <walletaddresshere>.worker1:@::ffff:192.168.1.222
debug: [Unknown stratum method from walletaddresshere.worker1 [::ffff:192.168.1.222]: mining.extranonce.subscribe] undefined


[01/23/2022 7:59 PM] DishBrain#1197
This is probably better to be asked in the solo-mining channel.


[01/24/2022 10:56 PM] Strider#6512
Do other people have acess to my stratum when I start it?


[01/25/2022 4:51 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Only if you let them


[01/26/2022 9:54 AM] kpolfi#7671
if I were to run a public node visible for example on this map: https://ergo.nodespyder.io/
is there some configs needed for that? scorex.network.declaredAddress was something i saw somewhere but node will not start with that set up.


[01/26/2022 6:05 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Dont think you need that set unless you are having Upnp issues or running on Cloud. A guess anyway


[01/26/2022 9:38 PM] cryptosafe#2323
Guys i have a issue im trying to setup solo mining on full local node but my node says synced at block 570180 and refuses to move.

Back story i tried this few months back followed some youtube tutorial that was overly complex for no reason guy made me install -big num package in java and i got confused and error at that point so i gave up today I went in and redid the api key, i downloaded latest node version and deleted the old node i didnt want to have to re sync from block zero am i forced to delete everything and start from scratch?

[01/27/2022 6:42 AM] kpolfi#7671
How do you know if connection is working both ways. Outgoing is quite clear, Synchronization state is Node is synced. But how about other way? Does the peers connected have anything to do with that?


[01/27/2022 8:04 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Redoing the api key and hash is no problem. Personally I‚Äôd start fresh. No need to do anything fancy. Just install the basics and use Java 11. You only need Java installed and use the pre packed .jar file. Barebones system setup other than that for me.

Most nodes don‚Äôt need inbound connections. They will connect to you from your initialisation out. It‚Äôs how p2p works


[01/27/2022 9:16 AM] kpolfi#7671
But doesn‚Äôt the network need certain amount of public nodes to work? Nodes that publish their ip for others to start the communication?


[01/27/2022 9:16 AM] cryptosafe#2323
I redid install still stuck on node syncing... i think i messed up the whole capability on my pc for it to do this I diwnloaded the new JAR release too and deleted most of the files to try act new


[01/27/2022 9:21 AM] cryptosafe#2323
Also i have no clue how to get the stratum stuff to work so i can mine with nb miner to my local node. 

Theres a video on youtube on how to but it skips critical steps and i cant trouble shoot my issues with the --big num  thing the first time i tried to do local node I got stuck on a error with big num and that was it i had already put some reasonable time in trying step by step but now im little more experienced and trying again and i cant get the node to just sync to the correct block hieght


[01/27/2022 9:31 AM] HelixEvo#2120
I'd imagine there are some master nodes out there.. Or its built into the code. I dont know that sorry.


[01/27/2022 9:33 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Not done anything with stratum to advise, but I would start fresh as in clean OS, but if its your main PC then maybe not best to run node on it and mine to it? Defo get java 11. I had issues with many other versions.


[01/27/2022 9:36 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Different people, different flavours... But I found what worked best for me was to run a barebones simple linux distro with java 11, ergo to run off seperate drive, 8GB RAM and that was it.

[01/27/2022 9:43 AM] cryptosafe#2323
I will try to change my java version to 11 tommorow  not sure what I have right now. 

All i know is my alephium node works good and wasnt to hard to setup solo mining im suprised at the difficulties to solo mine local node on ergo for how mainstream it is.

I would maybe do a clean install if I  knew how but my machine has no issues with anything else i have no clue how to setup linux sadly or  use it or anything of the sort even from a usb I tried mounting a partion to a usb once I think with OSF mount and I was just 100% lost. Because i wanted to use hive os. But never could figure it out and gave up.


[01/27/2022 9:45 AM] cryptosafe#2323
If i managed to setup linux on my other SSD in the system then got the ergo node synced on it i wouldnt have no idea how to get that to run off my windows NB miner. 


My main goal is just solo mine ergo with local node on my windows pc and use NB miner. No outside machines


[01/27/2022 9:45 AM] HelixEvo#2120

Node cannot sync
Hi there,  Yesterday i configured and started my node + wallet.  I tried to follow some posts already existing, but im affraid i was not able to fix it.   Currently i have my node and wallet running in a different machine from where im going to mine on a centOS machine.( on my first try i had at same machine, on windows 10)  Node version: 4.0.13...


[01/27/2022 9:13 PM] MGpai#4313

node db is configurable depending on what config you fed to it initially, but iirc $HOME/.ergo/ is the default. backup & move/wipe that to start fresh. java 17 oughta be fine. check your cmdline, should include -Xmx4g to assign 4gb ram to the node.

Azure


[01/28/2022 3:53 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Advice - node likes fast disks and plenty of cpu during sync. 4 cpu and 16 gb of ram with a 4 to 6 gb heap.

I'm in AWS...trying to find good way to get node going quick, but not quite there yet


[01/28/2022 7:01 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
@kushti I heard you may have some suggestions to copy .ergo folder to avoid full sync?  I'd like to create snapshots and restore to smaller instances on AWS and avoid the full sync if possible, but it keeps trying to rebuild much of the node...only once did it pickup where it left off properly


[01/28/2022 7:04 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
I've played around with a few configs...I'm having better luck with ARM vs x86 architecture.  Java seems to just die if anything happens on x86, but ARM tries to push through, but it doesn't stop nicely.  I can't sync with less than 8G total, 4G HEAP, although I'd like to just take a volume snapshot and restore to 4G T4g or something similar (perhaps a C* instance cause the CPU sometimes just gets throttled, although it's likely cause it's out of RAM).  Anyway, maybe that will help.  Have you found anything that works well?


[01/28/2022 7:51 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Hiya. Have you done snapshots of the machine or snapshots of the files/folders? Also did you snapshot the memory? Thanks.


[01/28/2022 8:06 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
I have tried a couple different options...snapshots of drives (wanted to test recreating with different iops although so far this seems to not be a big bottleneck), snapshot of the instance and I haven't really taken snapshot of memory yet...I've also tried to delete the LOCK files, but nothing consistently works yet


[01/28/2022 8:18 AM] cryptosafe#2323
Yout knowledge seems above me but as suggested by ziggomatic in the CMD line when starting your node use the -Xmx4g  example

Java -jar -Xmx4g ergo-4.0.21.1.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf


[01/28/2022 8:19 AM] cryptosafe#2323
I finaly got my node to start syncing also i found out you need to quickly after starting the node go to the ergo nod interface and put your api password and initialize the wallet


[01/28/2022 8:21 AM] cryptosafe#2323
Once i get my node synced im going to finaly be able to try figure out how to setup the stratum server so i can solo mine on my rig using nb miner that part i have no clue on but will cross that bridge when i get to it


[01/28/2022 8:26 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
Nice! I use the same startup, but -Xmx3g, although if I have at least 8G  RAM, the node typically syncs, I'm trying to get a 4G RAM EC2 running (even if I can sync with the bigger nodes).  I was able to get this EC2 to sync up to around 500k height...there seem to be some transactions that cause heap memory to overflow as best I can tell, it's happened on most of the nodes I've done a full sync on at same height.


[01/28/2022 8:27 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
I also typically run openjdk v.17, although considering trying v11 or oracle jdk (or whatever the other split is)


[01/28/2022 8:30 AM] cryptosafe#2323
Im syncing at 414000 right now il let you know if I as well hit the brick wall but I have 32 gb of ram on my pc, i got a little lost on some of your text excuse my ignorance haha


[01/28/2022 8:31 AM] cryptosafe#2323
I dont want to downgrade my java cause I solo mine Alephium via local node and there node setup  it works just fine they dont have a node interface for wallet its all in swagger instead the wallet is just a desktop wallet.


[01/28/2022 8:33 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
makes sense!  I typically run inside a docker although have tried outside to make sure docker isn't causing issues...I seem to have the same problems either way.  I also have used sysstat a bit to try and identify bottlenecks.  It seems mostly when RAM fills up, or the files are not cleanly shutdown.  Anyway, I hope you're able to fully sync!

[01/28/2022 8:39 AM] cryptosafe#2323
How do you cleanly shutdown a node? Also not sure what a docker is im learing here now. 

Side note
Recently today I did something new and cool im on ethernet and inhave a z170x g3 msi board that has a killer e2200 ethernet 1gb/s speed so i downloaded a neat piece of software for it called killer inteligence center the software stops all unnessesary services they may cause internet speed to slow down on your windows rig and i mean a huge list of stuff it shuts down. It basicallt overides windows 10 non sense on its own by simply making downloads of everything impossible by blocking it from the ethernet controller.


[01/28/2022 8:40 AM] cryptosafe#2323

nice! ya, the internet speed definitely affects how fast you can fully sync!  I just upgraded service and it made a huge difference, although requires barely any bandwidth once it is sync'd, so I'm trying to reconcile the EC2 systems based on whether its syncing or already sync'd...no need to pay for an 8G EC2 when it's already sync'd

Just tested on my machines.. I can clone my node and spin it up and it syncs straight off with log all looking good.


[01/28/2022 10:59 AM] HelixEvo#2120
This method looks to be handy if I ever want to quickly spin up multiple nodes in a few minutes depending on how long the drive snapshots were static for. Never need to do that but handy to know üëç


[01/28/2022 11:01 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
Ya! I'm hoping to automate snapshots so it's always current...would take 5 mins or so to spin up a full node if I can figure it out :)


[01/28/2022 11:01 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Is it worth creating VM importable files and disks for download you think? Save some people muddling through a guide. Just leave the wallet and api procedures to complete. Plus would give them a leg up on blocks already done

[01/28/2022 11:39 AM] Leif Erickson#8939
You could make a docker container available easily.  A daily snapshot could be put up on the docker hub and a script could verify it's shutdown properly and that it can spin up and fully sync pretty easy


[01/28/2022 11:41 AM] Leif Erickson#8939

It may be worth adding some documentation about setting up the attached volumes and permissions...just my opinion, and I'm pretty good with docker but it still took some effort to get going

Personal choice also I guess. I mean for things that are not too complex I‚Äôd go for native. Stuff That requires potch I‚Äôd use docker like with the executor bots. I‚Äôd be interested to see how much more hungry a docker node is compared to a native setup node.

I noticed that things stalled a few times during syncing... so I closed the program and restarted it to keep it going...


[01/28/2022 6:20 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
Same.  Even on mid tier AWS hardware, the client is very susceptible to CPU spikes.  And I‚Äôve tried a good amount of instance types at this point. On a local machine, I have to point the external air conditioning unit on the box to sync w/o overheating üò≥

Closing and reopening the client restarts the CPU spike cycle in my research.


[01/28/2022 6:24 PM] VertErgo#5544
The good thing is once it's synced,  CPU usage goes down to almost nothing.  But, yes I noticed all my PC fans were maxed out during the syncing process...


[01/28/2022 6:26 PM] glasgowm#9381
You're running a full node yes. It won't show on that website though as that's only nodes that are exposed to the web


[01/28/2022 6:37 PM] VertErgo#5544
The website should make that clear upfront (not in the fine print), as it may convey a negative message... 70 nodes isn't great.


[01/28/2022 8:06 PM] SirPlumPits#1760
I'm trying to consolidate the txs by sending all the utxos back to myself, however I'm getting an error message on the ergo node.
The error message starts with Bad request List(PaymentRequest(... with a huge string of text afterwards.

I've searched on this server for people who have the same problem, but I wasn't able to figure out what is the actual cause of this error.

I'm not very well versed on ergo, so I'm not very knowledgeable about what can be the issue. The wallet that I'm using received mining payments so I'm guessing the tx boxes are really "dusty".
I'm able to send small amounts of ergo but that doesn't really help much.

Does anyone know what could be going on?


[01/28/2022 8:55 PM] SirPlumPits#1760
I think I solved part of the problem.
I had to send myself smaller amounts, bit by bit.

I did an OVF for ERGO node which is running Fedora Server and up to date with block height from this afternoon. Vanilla build, but all service startups on boot etc all in place. Just needs API key procedure done to the conf and its good to go.. If anyone want me to upload, let me know. 30GB download.


[01/30/2022 7:44 PM] HelixEvo#2120
I did it to use as a fresh backup or if I want another node somewhere

Being able to access it via the external ip

ok thanks! so it is running as a public node now.


[02/01/2022 2:58 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Like including the wallet key store or conf file by accident.  Maybe specify what directories from the node are needed for a portable node copy explicitly to prevent a mistake.

@glasgowm my node stuck on -2k blocks from current 676418. Is there any way to bring it to life without full resyncing? Restarting doesn't help üòµ‚Äçüí´. openjdk 11, 4.0.22 and "-Xmx3G" flag


[02/01/2022 7:28 AM] pragmaxim#0778
can you give it more `Xmx`? We made syncing more eager to prevent akka message queue overflow which needs slightly bit more Mem at "spikes" (my guess)


[02/01/2022 7:56 AM] MarantzCube#4825
Already üò§ restarted from backup. But it is not right way to fix "stuck issue".


[02/01/2022 7:58 AM] MarantzCube#4825

No, you need a stratum proxy for miner connection. Even then it would be solo mining so for you to find blocks and receive rewards you need lots of hashrate

Does it take a good amount of time after you do that to sync?

Depends on when snapshot was done. But not using AWS, using Azure

either that, or how can I generate a new address for my existing wallet?


[02/05/2022 10:50 PM] 6directions#1089
looks like I can use `/wallet/init` endpoint to generate a mnemonic for a new wallet, and `/wallet/restore` to restore it.

but curious about which endpoint I can use to just generate a new address for the wallet I already have.


[02/05/2022 11:48 PM] 6directions#1089
nvm. figured it out. was able to generate new address for wallet by querying `/wallet/deriveNextKey`.


[02/06/2022 11:38 PM] MGpai#4313
@kushti Few ideas to implement in the node:

1) Have a parameter for TX fee while making a post api request
2) When rescanning all blocks after restoring wallet, there should be a parameter to start the scan at a specific block. 
For example if I only created the wallet at block 600k I should not need to scan starting from block 0

[02/06/2022 11:58 PM] pragmaxim#0778

I'm trying to get an Ergo node up and running on my Windows machine. Having followed the "Set Up a Full Node" guide. I'm running into a number of different issues.

Viewing the web GUI it appears to be syncing, I see the Block counter going up, getting ever closer to the current block, but after maybe 30 minutes it stops.

I see a number of messages in the console output, I don't think they're all related, but any one of them could be causing the issue.

```Declared address validation failed:
 /<externalIP>:9030 not match any of the listening address: Set(/127.0.0.1:9030, /192.168.1.222:9030, /<someotherInternalIP starting with 172>:9030)
 or Gateway WAN address: None```

```ErgoReadersHolder - Got GetReaders request in state (None,None,None,None)```

```s.c.n.DeliveryTracker - Stop expecting <some GUID> of type 102 due to exceeded number of retries 3```

and a lot of

```Message [akka.io.Tcp$Register] from Actor[akka://ergoref/system/Materializers/StreamSupervisor-0/<...>] to Actor[akka://ergoref/system/IO-TCP/selectors/$a/<...>] was not delivered. [6] dead letters encountered.```

I've tried searching in this channel for these errors but didn't find any solution. Anyone have any ideas what I can do?

I'm using the latest version, 4.0.23 and starting it with this command line:
```java -Dlogback.stdout.level=WARN -XX:ActiveProcessorCount=2 -jar -Xmx3G ergo-4.0.23.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf```


[02/08/2022 5:25 PM] DishBrain#1197
and here's my ergo.conf
```ergo {
  networkType = "mainnet"

  node {
    mining = false
    useExternalMiner = false
  }

  voting {
    4 = 8000000
  }
}

  network {
    declaredAddress = "<ExternalIP>:9030"
    bindAddress = "0.0.0.0:9030"

Does someone know how Node's utxo/withPool/byId API behaves when it gets asked for a box that is spent in mempool only? does it return an error or does it return the box?


[02/09/2022 7:27 AM] kpolfi#7671
Hi, question that might rise to a suggestion/issue:

I see quite many of these log messages in node log:
`[tor.default-dispatcher-15] s.c.n.peer.PeerManager - /169.254.191.146:9030 removed from peers database`

Shouldn't these 169.254.x.x ips be blocked from even entering the node peer db? Now it seems that a connection is attempted to these and it is never going to work. It is just waste of resources.


[02/11/2022 2:31 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
I would agree, maybe ensure an option to only include peers who have external address defined.  This is probably the local address to the node being broadcast out to the rest of the p2p network


[02/11/2022 2:31 AM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
or exclude private addressesed peers from being considered in a form of node conf


[02/11/2022 11:53 AM] glasgowm#9381

[02/12/2022 2:11 PM] glasgowm#9381
Fixed? Try with the minimal conf. No need for the voting if you're not mining. Doubt your need the bind address either. Should just be

```
    ergo {
      node {
        mining = false
      }
    }

    scorex {
     restApi {
        apiKeyHash = "324dcf027dd4a30a932c441f365a25e86b173defa4b8e58948253471b81b72cf"
      }
    }
```


[02/12/2022 2:15 PM] DishBrain#1197
Thanks for the feedback. I will be mining to the node. Was just interested in trying out solo mining to my own node. And figured I‚Äôd have the voting part in there for when the vote takes place.


[02/12/2022 2:19 PM] glasgowm#9381
Ah right, did you get it synced or same issue?


[02/12/2022 2:21 PM] DishBrain#1197
Same issue


[02/12/2022 2:25 PM] glasgowm#9381
Errors you sent don't say much. First one is due to you trying to define an address. GetReaders (None,None) can happen during the start or DB corruption. 

I was going to say try the `grep` commands in the pin but I don't think they have that in Win heh

Maybe install WSL and try? Re-run with minimal conf. I've not seen `-XX:ActiveProcessorCount=2` being used before but suppose it shouldn't hurt. You can also try the `kvsync` branch which fixed this issue for me on Mac - but it should be happening at the end rather than the start if that were the case.

I‚Äôm a software developer and I‚Äôm still having trouble.


[02/12/2022 8:03 PM] DishBrain#1197
There was a time that it did appear to be up and running, it was synced and all that, but it was still showing a bunch of errors in the console. Then in Cygwin I did nose start.js and had set it to varDiff. I noticed that it appeared to change difficulty in the opposite direction it should‚Äôve to target the number of shares per second that was set. So it ended up making my miner submit hundreds of shares per second. So I went in and rewrote the logic in there and after that is changed the difficulty correctly.


[02/12/2022 8:04 PM] DishBrain#1197
But I still wasn‚Äôt confident enough that the node itself was running correctly, even though I could see shares being submitted to it, and when the network moved on to the next block I could see that passing along. But all the random error messages didn‚Äôt I still confidence that it was in fact working correctly. I didn‚Äôt want to waste a bunch of time solo mining to it only to find that it was broken the whole time.

[02/13/2022 12:26 AM] DishBrain#1197
I had that happen, and the only way I was able to fix it was to backup my conf file and then delete the entire folder and start over. Seemed like a corrupt database issue or something.

Help with log settings in Ergonode. I tried to search... but I could not find any documentation. Is there a setting for log levels? The default logging is really using a lot a disk space...
I don't understand the reason why default settings logs 'INFO'. Expected behaviour would be for 'WARNING' and above.

In order to accept incoming txs and run a full node I had to add to the ergo.conf file under scorex:
network {
bindAddress = "0.0.0.0:9030"
declaredAddress = "my external IP address:9030"
}.  I also had to use port forwarding.

üòÖ Heh, if u scroll up this chat,  you'll see that I've been trying to run node since summer ü§™. One 100% way  is to sync once and make a backup. If the node gets stuck again later, you can start from that backup point instead of sync from scratch. Also u can check pinned comments, may help.


[02/17/2022 10:13 PM] Jeon#9687
Ok, I will back up the entire blockchain. This is a good tip and I will do this. It‚Äôs a bummer because I like the idea of a PoW coin with dapps but I‚Äôve got a node for another coin, only $2M market cap, been running for months zero issues. And it‚Äôs a novel native chain. No one should have to backup the whole chain to run a node.

@MGpai üëã I wanted to add the Fee to payment request, but it would be an API breaking change ... as the Body is an array of PaymentRequests that each turns into a TX ... and there is one Fee Tx for all of these


[02/18/2022 10:09 PM] pragmaxim#0778
`transaction/send` is like this : 
```
      "requests" -> holder.requests.asJson,
      "fee" -> holder.feeOpt.asJson,
```


[02/18/2022 10:09 PM] pragmaxim#0778
but `payment/send` is unfortunatelly just an array of those requests ... I would have to introduce something like `/v2/` endpoint


[02/18/2022 10:10 PM] MGpai#4313
thank you


[02/18/2022 10:11 PM] MGpai#4313
what is the difference besides the fee between `transaction/send` and `payment/send`?


[02/18/2022 10:12 PM] pragmaxim#0778
imho the reason is that the API was not designed well for `payment/send` ... and when the `transaction/send` endpoint was created, the `fee` was taken into consideration


[02/18/2022 10:13 PM] pragmaxim#0778
but breaking change is never good, to add the fee, I would have to create `/v2/payment/send` and design the POST body the same way as `transaction/send` is done


[02/18/2022 10:15 PM] MGpai#4313
ah ok


[02/18/2022 10:16 PM] pragmaxim#0778
payment is just json array `requests.asJson` whereas `transaction/send` is : 
```
      "requests" -> holder.requests.asJson,
      "fee" -> holder.feeOpt.asJson,
```


[02/18/2022 10:16 PM] pragmaxim#0778
I will ask around and consider doing the `/v2`


[02/18/2022 10:29 PM] MGpai#4313

I had similar issues. I increased memory to get the node to fully sync. It *believe* it helped to reduce the amount of logs also. This is what worked for me: "_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx8G -Dlogback.stdout.level=WARN -Dlogback.file.level=ERR". After the sync completed I could revert back to -Xmx3G

Hey folks, 
asked yesterday in TG. My nodes aren't syncinc properly anymore. When I check the log, it is filled with: 
07:52:20.273 INFO  [ctor.default-dispatcher-6] o.e.m.CandidateGenerator$ - Avoiding generation of a block without any transactions
07:52:20.273 WARN  [ctor.default-dispatcher-6] o.e.m.CandidateGenerator - Can not generate block candidate: either mempool is empty or chain is not synced (maybe last block not fully applied yet

I am running ergo within a docker container. For the docker daemon configuration I use docker-compose. in docker-.compose, i set -Xmx6G (VM has 8G of RAM). 

My redacted ergo.conf looks like this: 
ergo {
  node {
    mining = true
    useExternalMiner = true
    miningPubKeyHex = 0266[SNIP]7c8
  }
  chain {
    monetary {
      minerRewardDelay = 10
    }
    voting {
      4 = 8000000
    }
  }
}

scorex {
 restApi {
    # Hex-encoded Blake2b256 hash of an API key.
    # Should be 64-chars long Base16 string.
    # below is the hash of the string 'hello'
    # replace with your actual hash
   apiKeyHash = "37c4[SNIP]235"
  }
}


Where is my misstake? What am I doing wrong= Has the value on miningPubKeyHex to in "quotas"?


[02/25/2022 7:57 AM] Ianor#2769

primary for mining. the wallet node is another vm


[02/25/2022 8:17 AM] Ianor#2769
so there is no privkey on that node


[02/25/2022 8:18 AM] HelixEvo#2120
You should have the hash in that config I‚Äôd of thought. Not the key?


[02/25/2022 8:22 AM] HelixEvo#2120
I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôd probably strip back the file to barebones config and make sure that works, then build back into it


[02/25/2022 8:22 AM] Ianor#2769
i have the apiKeyHash in the config (even when not used) and have the miningPubKeyHex value from my wallet nodes http://127.0.0.1:9053/swagger#/mining/miningReadMinerRewardPubkey API endpoint

Unless someone sees issue with that config. I don‚Äôt use mine for mining currently, so don‚Äôt know the extras you have in there


[02/25/2022 9:10 AM] Ianor#2769
ergo {
  node {
    mining = true
    useExternalMiner = true
    miningPubKeyHex = 0266[SNIP]7c8
  }
}

scorex {
 restApi {
    # Hex-encoded Blake2b256 hash of an API key.
    # Should be 64-chars long Base16 string.
    # below is the hash of the string 'hello'
    # replace with your actual hash
   apiKeyHash = "37c4[SNIP]235"
  }
}

okey, this configuration is working. The problem now is, that I have to wait 720 blocks for confirmation when a block is found. How can I set this to 10?


[02/25/2022 9:20 AM] Ianor#2769
okey, as soon as my config looks like this
ergo {
  node {
    mining = true
    useExternalMiner = true
    miningPubKeyHex = 0266[SNIP]7c8
  }
  chain {
    monetary {
      minerRewardDelay = 10
    }
  }
}

scorex {
 restApi {
    # Hex-encoded Blake2b256 hash of an API key.
    # Should be 64-chars long Base16 string.
    # below is the hash of the string 'hello'

i have run testnet node, already send balance to my testnet wallet, and still not get any balance but in testnet explorer already done the transactions here is the conf
https://testnet.ergoplatform.com/en/addresses/3Wy9xWAMkhqYVMH15WWXgVRT83i7cEKsxZfnRTZho8GtxN8bJg8P here is the confirmations and my balance still 0 until now

okei maybe its time to sync, thank you for the solution, anw is mining=true required ? on the testnet, what if in mainnet ?, is it required too ?

hi what is different between fullheader and headerheight in /info endpoint ?


[03/08/2022 8:57 AM] jason#6142
can i get the balance of certain address in endpoint ?


[03/08/2022 2:01 PM] glasgowm#9381
Sorry don't have much experience with testnet - It's not required on mainnet, but on testnet you need to mine the blocks (But I think someone else might be doing this atm)

[03/08/2022 2:02 PM] glasgowm#9381
headers are sync'd before the blocks - so `headersHeight` will reach the latest height, then `height` should start synchronising. `fullHeight` should only display when it's done IIRC

[03/08/2022 3:24 PM] jason#6142
how about this, is there any endpoint to get balance for specific address ?? @glasgowm


[03/08/2022 3:27 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
node wallet address or any address?


[03/08/2022 3:27 PM] jason#6142
node wallet address


[03/08/2022 3:30 PM] jason#6142
n i want to know is ```isInitialized``` in /status can be false ?, or can i get out or disconnect to my init wallet ?, because i have already done restart the node and change the api key and the status of ```isInitialized``` still true


[03/08/2022 3:50 PM] glasgowm#9381
You need to delete the wallet to clear that


[03/08/2022 3:51 PM] glasgowm#9381
`rm -rf .ergo/wallet`


[03/08/2022 3:53 PM] jason#6142
ahh okei, thank you


[03/08/2022 3:54 PM] glasgowm#9381
You need to use `/wallet/deriveNextKey`


[03/08/2022 3:54 PM] glasgowm#9381
Don't think there is, not sure the best method here @Ilya | Spectrum ?


[03/08/2022 3:58 PM] jason#6142
got it, okay, thanks @glasgowm

[03/08/2022 8:45 PM] abchris#8522
Hey, am just getting started building the api around the new ergowatch backend. `/addresses/{address}/balance` should do what you're after. See <https://ergo.watch/api/v0/docs>.
It's still alpha and subject to change, so let me know if you rely on it for something non trivial.

[03/08/2022 9:41 PM] glasgowm#9381
How would you usually do this with the node? Get the addresses then query the explorer?


[03/08/2022 9:45 PM] abchris#8522
Summing the balance of all unspent boxes belonging to an address. The explorer has an api to yield unspent boxes for a given address. With the node I guess you'd have to use the scan api.

hi guys can you tell me step to make a transaction and send to address because i already tried this endpoint with the data and comes out with error
```    curl -X 'POST' \

and error

is there any wrong format of body request to send transaction ?


[03/09/2022 9:28 AM] jason#6142
or is there any docs/ blog to make transaction until done ?


[03/09/2022 9:53 AM] glasgowm#9381
You need to paste the `bodId` into `inputsRaw` I believe @kushti


[03/09/2022 10:01 AM] jason#6142
this is /transaction/send, is it requires inputs raw too ?


[03/09/2022 10:08 AM] glasgowm#9381
you can pass an empty array if you don't want to specify inputs yourself but it looks like you're passing `string`

{Reactions}

[03/09/2022 10:08 AM] jason#6142
well i think i get the result of transactionid with /wallet/transaction/send with empty array in inputsraw 
``` curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:9052/wallet/transaction/send' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'api_key: hello' \

      "value": 2500000000
    }
  ],
  "fee": 1000000,
  "inputsRaw": []}'```

and now im confuse whats the next step after payment send


[03/09/2022 8:43 PM] MGpai#4313
here is what I do on python


[03/09/2022 8:43 PM] MGpai#4313
```
def sendNft(address, tokenId):
    headers = {
        'accept': 'application/json',
        'api_key': API_KEY,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    out = [
        {
            "address": address,
            "value": 10 ** 6,
            "assets": [
                {
                    "tokenId": tokenId,
                    "amount": 1
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
    tx_id = requests.post('http://{}/wallet/payment/send'.format(NODE_IP), headers=headers, data=json.dumps(out)).json()
    return tx_id


def unlockWallet():
    headers = {
        'accept': 'application/json',
        'api_key': API_KEY,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    out = {
        "pass": PW
    }
    resp = requests.post('http://{}/wallet/unlock'.format(NODE_IP), headers=headers, data=json.dumps(out)).json()
    return resp
```


[03/09/2022 8:44 PM] MGpai#4313
you can just remove the assets portion if you only want to send ERG


[03/09/2022 8:44 PM] MGpai#4313
this api call does not require you to input a fee


[03/09/2022 8:44 PM] MGpai#4313
it uses the default of 0.001 ERG I think


[03/09/2022 8:45 PM] MGpai#4313
you must call the unlock wallet function once before sending the tx if you dont want to go to the web ui and unlock it manually


[03/09/2022 8:45 PM] MGpai#4313
and this only needs to be one in a while


[03/09/2022 8:46 PM] MGpai#4313
you dont need the inputs raw field btw

That means node/info returned another height than it accepted on the same time. anyone have an explanation for this? did we have an orphan block or some kind of rollback on the node on this height?

if the panel-ui does not show it, then it is still downloading the headers perhaps ... if it got stuck during block downloading, you would see the height there

Deleted it all, starting again.


[03/20/2022 12:58 PM] rustinmyeye#3722
Good luck! One thing I noticed is that the amount of system memory seems to have an effect on how easily the node syncs the first time. My systems with less than 16gb of ram had a really hard time syncing the first time. Once they do sync though they run well and re-sync easily if you have to shut the machine down for any reason.


[03/20/2022 1:04 PM] pragmaxim#0778
yeah memory is important for the initial syncing https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Set-up-a-full-node#running-the-node-for-the-first-time

Hi guys, I'm trying to run a node for the first time. I launched the ergo-installer script but it's stucked on "Executing ergo node to obtain API key hash...." How long should it take?


[03/20/2022 3:37 PM] gentilepaoli#0711
I'm on linux (wsl)


[03/20/2022 3:44 PM] jason#6142
i think you need to generate api key hash from current node, to access another api endpoint, generate api key with ```/utils/hash/blake2b'```
and put the result into config

The GetBlok testnet node is also stuck at this height. Maybe due to some of the soft-fork testing? Not really sure but I'm unable to use testnet at all because of it.

[03/21/2022 1:07 PM] kushti#0978
4.0.24 should be better, and more optimizations are coming in .25 and further


[03/21/2022 1:10 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
might be, but @glasgowm was concerned as well. that would mean that they either tried in the very same second, or (more probable) the situation lasted for some time. the user on twitter had the problem sending funds from the app, and the app fetches the nodeinfo, builds the tx and submits it without any pause, which also brings me to the assumption there was some time where the nodeinfo reported a block height that it did not accept for submission.
situation resolved by itself, but I wanted to let you know in case this happens again or already happened in the past.

After this block, we have two different chains: 
https://testnet.ergoplatform.com/en/blocks/bb03d56497a1a9a9d54de9a2bfcff8226e708ba89a8507edd86efea97f3df9b5

And looks like node fetch invalid chain. Any idea how to fix it?


[03/21/2022 6:07 PM] jason#6142
i just remove .ergo file and restart the node, not always success b cause already tried 4-5 times to re run that, and now already sync

I did that several times

Lmao that's crazy a fork!


[03/21/2022 6:41 PM] MGpai#4313
So are our nodes running the dead chain which isn't moving?


[03/21/2022 7:03 PM] Pulsarz#9208
the only solution is probably to get the latest release of the node and resync (I think)


[03/21/2022 7:14 PM] Yaroslav#5375
I use 4.0.23, which is the latest in dockerhub


[03/21/2022 10:05 PM] kushti#0978
are  you using headersHeight or fullHeight ?


[03/21/2022 10:08 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I think appkit uses the last header from blocks/lastHeaders/ for the new preheaders - @morphic will know exactly


[03/21/2022 10:13 PM] kushti#0978
@Yaroslav @MGpai try with this backup maybe 176.9.15.237:8000/testnet-back.zip

you can sync with master, for mining, use eip27-activation branch

I keep getting a timeout error


[03/23/2022 1:32 AM] stateanomaly#4764
I figured out what was happening with my bad api key issue. When I ran the node script, it was starting two instances of the process. I'm new to this so at first I thought that was normal, but then in my most recent try, I just let it sync for a few minutes and then it lost connection to the node and reconnected again. Now, there was only one ergo node process running and the api key worked. I'm not sure why this is happening. Sorry if this is a noob question. It could be because I'm running Ubuntu through WSL?


[03/23/2022 1:34 AM] stateanomaly#4764
I'm sure that it's starting two instances because I noticed this after killing all the processes, deleting the ergo directory and launching a fresh script.

hi guys i want to know, how to differentiate between sender(from), receiver(to) and fee from output of list wallet transactions response ?


[03/23/2022 8:28 AM] abchris#8522
Simple case: inputs are sender, outputs receivers and output with address starting with 2iH (or 2Hi?) is fees.
When  addresses appear on both sides, need to take diff of balances to see if they sent or received


[03/23/2022 10:19 AM] jason#6142
ok, thank you


[03/23/2022 5:50 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
Did you have both of the processes running to the same datadir? - if so, I suspect you may need to restart your chain download ;(.   The syncing process is very I/O intensive on your disk.  Expect a day or two at least before it's synced.  Also, I'm pretty sure the latest version of Ergo client (released a few days ago) will tell you if your node is "stuck".   In my experience, it means you have to redownload the chain.  Without that notification, it's pretty hard to tell that it's "stuck".


[03/23/2022 5:52 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
Thank you for checking!! - do you have mining set to true in your config by chance?


[03/23/2022 6:13 PM] MGpai#4313
no it is set to false


[03/23/2022 7:02 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
Is there anyway you could try it with it set to true? - I think it needs to be one to generate block candidates.


[03/23/2022 7:03 PM] MGpai#4313

I kinda wish nodes didn't come with wallets. So many of the instructions focus on the wallet and security of the node because it has a wallet... Just seems to make it all more complicated I think


[03/25/2022 12:38 PM] SoCool#6419
Valuable for solo mining if you're running a node but not a stratus server I guess, just seems it would be nice to not have that at all to worry about for setting up a node

Hi guys I'm syncing my ERGO node since yesterday, few questions for when I'm able to mine, what is the maturity time for the payouts? In order to mine should I use the node wallet or my own wallet and the node wallet will execute payouts? is there any way to look at each block I will be "wining" I'm ok if this is in the log with a grep but what would be the keyword?

Thanks for a quick reply. Do I receive more ERGO rewards if I run a local node wallet and mine on it? Or is the reward the same as mining on a pool (such as e.g. 2miners)?


[03/25/2022 9:41 PM] glasgowm#9381
Should be about the same, maybe less since you're competing against other people optimising their miners.

[03/26/2022 2:24 AM] Elemental#9509
gotcha. Thanks for that üôÇ Btw out of curiosity, would I be able to host a node off a vps (8 cores, 16gb ram, 160gb nvme), to test it? or would a dedicated server be required?


[03/26/2022 2:25 AM] Elemental#9509
also, anyone have any idea if latency between the stratum and node matter?


[03/26/2022 2:28 AM] Elemental#9509
also, would I be able to sync the node on my own (higher end pc) then just transfer the files to a (lower end) vps/dedicated and it keeps all the synced data? Or does it specifically have to be synced from scratch on a new machine?


[03/26/2022 5:44 AM] abchris#8522
Yes, more than enough. I have one running smoothly on 4 core 8GB and had it on 2 core 4GB just fine before that (was a while ago tho)

That‚Äôs not my field, but seeing getblok‚Äôs efforts, i would assume the answer is yes


[03/26/2022 10:33 AM] SoCool#6419
Historically the node could run on rPi. I believe it still can with a little tweaking.

It's explicitly meant to be usable by average folk, so no need for expensive hardware


[03/26/2022 10:34 AM] Elemental#9509
@abchris @SoCool gotcha. Out of curiosity, what specs would you guys recommend for a 24/7 node?


[03/26/2022 10:51 AM] SoCool#6419
I am not a node expert, but typically people recommend running a node on basically any hardware. The rPi thing isn't a joke, people do currently run nodes on them. The main bottleneck for ergo node is I believe disk IO, so faster disk will improve it. I can't speak to disk size necessary as I don't run a node. I don't think it's crazy though.

Ergo focus on decentralization means no need for thousands of dollars in hardware, otherwise it couldn't decentralize

How to setup an Ergo node on a Raspberry Pi
Mute if you dont want to hear my vega64‚Äôs breathing in the background. I made this because the official one contains some errors and leaves out some useful information. If you follow along and do as I did, you will have a fully running node, it will take some time for it to fully sync the node on your pi. This process is nearly identical for set...

Means the database can't be read - likely due to corruption in unexpected shutdown. Need to resync - latest nodes have checkpointing and other stuff to fix itself from this


[03/29/2022 8:25 PM] pragmaxim#0778
we changed this from WARN to INFO in latest release, it is just waiting to be initialized ... this is not a problem ... it might take longer on slow machines


[03/30/2022 1:00 PM] Ch1n3du#7350
Thanks, I wanted to know if I could upgrade by just replacing the jar file, or do I have to resync from genesis?


[03/30/2022 1:16 PM] pragmaxim#0778
stop, replace jar, start

I've been thinking about this for a little while. I'm not trying to be rude when I say this, but I think it might come off as such. I just want to give an honest opinion about the node software.

Have you guys ever thought about rewriting the node in a different programming language? I dont believe java would be stable enough for Ergo. I dont think java would be efficient either when it comes to running smart contracts. I've had a lot of experience running and working with java programs. I've seen that java isn't very good when it comes to scaling up over time. I've seen that it can become buggy fast when it comes to load on the program. 

I know it would be a monumental task to rewrite the node software entirely in a different language. I won't ever deny that. I know the amount of effort it had to take to write the node software in the first place. Would you guys consider using Rust to rewrite the node? I think Rust would be a good candidate for stability and efficiency. 

Again I know this task would be monumental and I can see why you may not consider it. I know how annoying it can be to have to rewrite an entire program that's already established. 

Would you guys think it's possible with the way ergo is already setup?


[03/31/2022 7:13 AM] WheezyBackports#7260
Again this is just a suggestion I'm not trying to be rude here. I want to know your thoughts.


[03/31/2022 7:16 AM] WheezyBackports#7260
I know the node uses swagger for the api interfacing. I'm not sure if that would be a deal breaker or not for Ergo to have to rework.


[03/31/2022 7:18 AM] WheezyBackports#7260
I do kinda like how you can use API calls on the node to get information about it. I'll admit it felt a bit weird at first to do, but I can see use cases for it.


[03/31/2022 9:53 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
not rude at all. I don't think Java is the problem though. Java has one of the best-engineered VMs the world has seen and is capable of heavy load.


[03/31/2022 11:37 AM] glasgowm#9381
The node is written in Scala, but yeh the issue is not the language but the embedded library (LevelDB) + growing pains


[03/31/2022 12:28 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I also think root cause for many issues is leveldb. I already discussed with @pragmaxim if we could add an abstraction layer to swap the db implementations


[03/31/2022 1:04 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
I wasn't quite trying to say it was the problem, but could be a problem in the future. I'm thinking mass adoption and heavy network usage.

As for Java having the best engineered VM I could disagree on that a bit from my personal experience, but I guess it could be chalked up to it being finicky too.


[03/31/2022 1:05 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
Alright


[03/31/2022 1:10 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
This is going to sound really dumb when I say it. I used to run a shit ton of Minecraft servers. Now to begin with Minecraft isn't programmed very efficiently. I've ran both spigot and paper spigot. I always noticed a lot of the issues I had was with the way plugins were loaded and how many you had loaded at a time. 
The more plugins you had loaded the more everything dropped efficiency wise.

I'm by no means an expert. I'm thinking in some abstract way something similar could happen with running smart contracts. Im just trying to apply some of what I know here. I would have to read through the node source code to get a better idea of what's going on.


[03/31/2022 1:11 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
I know Javas garbage collection has gotten a lot better in recent years, so I wouldn't be too worried about that.


[03/31/2022 1:14 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
The portability is a plus at least


[03/31/2022 1:14 PM] WheezyBackports#7260
I would assume you can run an ergo node on just about anything that supports java


[03/31/2022 4:40 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
This!  Look at the below usage for our nodes, it often is overpowered by the amount of short term disk I/O, which even with premium SSD drives, often causes the node to fall behind on synchronization.  1GB short bursts is unusual.

I'm trying to run a node on an orange pi zero and wondering if maybe that's not the best idea


[03/31/2022 7:35 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
for now probably want something with a little more power i am barely keeping up with an rpi4 4gb


[03/31/2022 7:38 PM] cheese#5545
I'm seeing an error in the logs that says its probably caused by being on ARM


[03/31/2022 7:39 PM] cheese#5545
I'm glad I tried! I'll go bigger.


[03/31/2022 7:42 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
The issue is initial sync, it will consume lots of CPU and be very disk I/O intensive.  If you can clone an already sync'ed node, the ongoing operation should be smoother.  4GB java heap is ok, 6GB is better.


[03/31/2022 9:22 PM] eratosthenessieve#8181
Hey all, working on setting up a node on the testnet, I pulled the latest docker tag and am running the image on a Mac that has 8GB mem. Every time I try to sync, it gets up to block 7feca496e2be164de5cedbb4300031fe1f6189c7029d64eb2f6322707fdf9348 and then stops. Has someone had this issue before? Also, set max heap as 3G initially. Happy to provide more info if needed!


[03/31/2022 10:50 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
When we get ledger integration, what is the trade off between running a node as a wallet vs using the ledger device ? I can‚Äôt really find any ?


[03/31/2022 10:50 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
Maybe dapp connection if you want to use ergodex ?

What issues are you having? Have you grepped the logs (see pinned msgs). JVM9/11? Syncing can be intensive (high disk I/O, RAM) so ideally SDD + `-Xmx4G`

2 just means your wallet isn't initialised and 1 is a common warning afaik (it'll just move on). 

No experience with testnet - what do you mean stops? Does it switch to displaying 'Synchronised' at the wrong height or crash?


[04/04/2022 4:11 PM] eratosthenessieve#8181
It doesn't display "Synchronised", just continued "active synchronization", but very clearly stops accepting new heights after that block id. Doesn't crash either, just seems to make outgoing connections to peers


[04/04/2022 4:16 PM] glasgowm#9381
hmm not sure, can you upload the full `grep 'ERROR\|WARN'`


[04/04/2022 4:25 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
I'm having the same issue on testnet.  I've tried from local and cloud machines and it get's stuck on header download - always that exact same block he mentioned "ae789db2eb855589cafacdaf246c357ece89b204cdda8ae76714f571c2d34ad9".  I've memorized the header ID at this point lol.


[04/04/2022 4:27 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
Also, I do have 2 other testnet nodes that are synced, but I made the bonehead move of restarting my mining node and it doesn't generate a block candidate after I did that.   It's keep saying "Miner has not started yet" even after 48 hours of running it.  I'm not sure what's going on, but it's been going on for a few days.


[04/04/2022 4:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
are they all hosted at the same place?


[04/04/2022 4:29 PM] glasgowm#9381
not sure about that specific block - think maybe pragmaxim is looking into it (and that's who you meant to tag the last time?)


[04/04/2022 4:32 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
Not necessarily, I tired generating block candidates on local machines running on a DD5 and NVMe and still no luck.  That one's synced and I'd prefer to not try to start fresh :). I'm not entirely sure if any dev's looking into it tbh.   Last time I meant to tag a friend who was helping me trouble shoot the issue.  I haven't tried syncing on the local machine though.  I should be clear - two possibly different issues 1) can't sync, get's stuck at header "ae789db2eb855589cafacdaf246c357ece89b204cdda8ae76714f571c2d34ad9" and 2) I can't generate a block canidate even on fully synced nodes.


[04/04/2022 4:36 PM] glasgowm#9381
@pragmaxim can you check out this block.

Also could the optional checkpointing introduced in v4.0.24 help here? 

```
This PR is generalizing optional checkpointing introduced after the hard-fork. In this PR, it is possible to set arbitrary checkpoint. Scripts in blocks before the checkpoint will not be validated, correctness of UTXO set is checked anyway. Thus bootstrapping can be significantly improved with no security issues.
```

Maybe some script validation causing issues in that block

for 2) if you describe in more detail maybe @mhs_sam can help - are you running ErgoStratumProxy/ErgoStratumServer alongside the node?


[04/04/2022 4:44 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
I do have Stratum between the node and my miner.  It's this API method that isn't working:

[04/04/2022 11:00 PM] eratosthenessieve#8181
Sorry, just catching up on this thread. You're saying that deleting the state and history folders fixed your testnet node sync issue? Or was that referring to the other problem you had w/ adopting candidates?


[04/05/2022 12:22 AM] DreamsMoney#1427
The testnet wasn't adding new blocks because no one was mining on it.  I'm mining on it now and the networks adding new blocks.  That seemed to have started syncing unsynced nodes as well a few hours ago. 

I have to report that the recovering node ultimately didn't sync however.  It's currently stuck.


[04/05/2022 12:27 AM] DreamsMoney#1427

Building the sync branch now. I'm going to try that on one of my stuck nodes.   Unfortunately, now even my synced nodes are "synced" at an earlier block than the explorer...


[04/05/2022 5:28 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
The documented headerChainDiff = 80 doesn't seem to catch it up either.


[04/05/2022 5:36 PM] cheese#5545
Silly question but how do you shut the node down? I see there's a post in the swagger API to shutdown the node after 5 seconds but that doesn't seem to work. I know I can always nuke the process but is there a more graceful way?


[04/05/2022 5:42 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
I'm not sure if it would help, but has anyone successfully made an unpublic node public? I.e from my understanding, a "non public" node throws this warning.
`WARN [tor.default-dispatcher-11] s.c.n.NetworkController - 
Unable to define external address.
Specify it manually in 'scorex.network.declaredAddress'. an "unpublic" node mentions `

Even when I set scorex.network.declaredAddress, it states: 

`09:35:43.338 ERROR [ctor.default-dispatcher-6] s.c.n.NetworkController - Declared address validation failed:
 <domain-name>/<external-ip>:9020 not match any of the listening address: Set(/<internal-ip>:9020, /127.0.0.1:9020)
 or Gateway WAN address: None`

I'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding the documentation, but I thought we needed to declare our external IP?  I know the docs say to ignore this, but I'd love to serve a public node if there's a possibility.


[04/05/2022 5:43 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
Not silly at all üôÇ The API is indeed the most graceful way to shut it down.  Make sure you click the padlock icon on the top right and set your api_key before you try to run the shutdown method.


[04/05/2022 5:54 PM] cheese#5545
Gotcha! That was super helpful. I also noticed that the API calls through 127.0.0.1 and I was hitting the node by LAN IP from another machine so that was also giving me an issue I think


[04/05/2022 6:15 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
aaaah.  Yes, that'll do it as well.  I've also noticed that the port mismatches if you're on testnet.  mainnet should be 9053 and testnet should be 9052.

[04/07/2022 3:05 PM] eratosthenessieve#8181
Hey man, sorry for the late reply on this. So even once you started mining on the testnet again, my node wasn't able to move past that prior height of 185121. Is this expected? I did reset the history and state directories, but same outcome. Was there something I missed that I had to do to move past that prior block? Or is testnet still having issues


[04/07/2022 4:00 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
It's okay! - I barely got a day off today, so I'm hoping to submit tickets today.  I'm actually experiencing the exact same results.  I have 3 test nodes, 1 local, 2 in the cloud.   The local one that previously synced still thinks it's "synced" but when I compare it against the testnet explorer, it's clearly off...  The second cloud node I cleared and tried to resync, and it's stuck.  At least with node 2 however it know's it's stuck as it produces clear output.  Glasgow did ask for people to test with a development branch - I'm going to compile that today and try it.   I'll report back, but you're welcome to test as well.

tldr; - from my experience, testnet is indeed still having issues.

tried for two weeks to run a node on a Raspi4 4MB. every little network hiccup, lost connection to PI and need to delete everything and try to resync. why is the Ergo node so poorly written? can't find anywhere a command to repair the corrupted blocks and continue syncing. I run a Ravencoin node and compared is a dream to administer... Or I am missing something...


[04/09/2022 6:32 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
Are you trying on mainnet?  Any chance you can share your logs for the Raspi4 node?


[04/09/2022 8:00 PM] dunarea-albastra#6108
mainnet. don't have anymore logs. deleted everything for the third time... I just need a CLI option to repair the damn thing. anyway the only reason I was trying to run the node is because of the official wallet. I always use official wallets for my coins.


[04/09/2022 8:47 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
I love Yoroi personally


[04/09/2022 9:05 PM] dunarea-albastra#6108
it bothers me the official node is unreliable. such neglect casts doubt about the future. RVN is inflationary, ERG has shitty software. is there another POW honest coin to hang on?


[04/09/2022 9:16 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
Honestly, I can't speak to those coins because I haven't tried or researched them.  I can tell you that most chains are very resource extensive on sync, Ergo's no exception.  Once Ergo syncs however, it takes up very little resources.  I have synced mainnet nodes running in the cloud and migrated them to magnetic hard drives for cheap, < $10 a month.  

But I'll admit, the syncing part is rarely enjoyable! üôÇ  Those production nodes took me weeks to sync as well.  Most of it was troubleshooting unfortunately. 

I've learned that it's best to sync blockchains on stronger machines.  You can then transfer to and run the chain on your Rasberry PI. I'd recommend that if you wanted to continue to use that.  I've had to use this method quite a few blockchains in the past.


[04/09/2022 10:18 PM] dunarea-albastra#6108
I already have the same synced on a windows machine. but for some reason the history file format generated on the Pi s different. .sst vs .ldb. different extension. and doesn't resume like it should. very bizarre.


[04/09/2022 10:42 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
ahhhhhh.  I've ran into this issue! üôÇ  From my experience, .ldb files are used in x86 CPU architectures, and .sst are used in ARM.  Unfortunately, I had so many issues trying sync on ARM machines, that I switched back to x86.. 

If you're into the dev side of things - from my understanding, the issue with those .sst files lays in the data engine itself, and not Ergo.  That's not practical help of course, but I managed to research that tid bit.


[04/09/2022 10:45 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
Oh man, and Rasberry PI 4 is ARM... Unfortunately, I never succeeded in syncing that. No matter what I tried.

I see... I'm not dev but asking other places only... crickets. 10x for pointing the problem. too bad the ARM side is not debugged, or solved... much energy is spent on NFTs but seems none on running on 4watt capable devices. having a full hardware wallet/node in your pocket would have been nice.


[04/09/2022 11:59 PM] cheese#5545
Is there a way to get the chains current height from a node while it is still syncing? I can see that /info from the swagger api will give the current synced height, but not the total height. I'm looking to generate a percentage representing the sync progress.


[04/10/2022 2:44 AM] cheese#5545
As a solution I ended up grabbing the largest height seen from peers

[04/12/2022 12:36 AM] eratosthenessieve#8181
@Cheese Enthusiast Hey, just saw the note in testnet documentation that faucet payouts are frozen. Any way to get some test erg?


[04/12/2022 12:42 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Issues with EIP 27 caused by old node clients, newer clients may have trouble syncing because of it. I am going to roll back to 4.0.23 to do some testing, and Ill let you know if it works. We might be contributing to the problem a little, but I think at this point testnet may need to be restarted from the beginning anyway.


[04/12/2022 12:42 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Once I roll back, Ill send your wallet 100 test erg, just lmk your address


[04/12/2022 12:44 AM] MGpai#4313
linux or windows?


[04/12/2022 1:12 AM] eratosthenessieve#8181
Okay thanks! Do you have an ETA on the rollback? I'll shoot ya a message once roll back happens üôÇ


[04/12/2022 4:25 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
I would be on board with restarting testnet if it solves the issue.


[04/12/2022 4:26 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
I can't sync my wallet chains for about two days now.


[04/12/2022 5:19 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Not up to me, so I guess we will see what happens. So far it looks like rolling back to 4.0.23 has worked, at least for the time being

learned from @DreamsMoney if known peers is provided and peer connections are restricted then the node will not get stuck


[04/13/2022 3:36 AM] MGpai#4313
I wrote a python script to aggregate all nodes that are synced and healthy

[04/13/2022 3:37 AM] MGpai#4313
which then gets put into the ergo.conf AUTOMATICALLY and starts the synced node


[04/13/2022 3:37 AM] MGpai#4313
its pretty cool


[04/13/2022 3:37 AM] MGpai#4313
and I updated all snapshots


[04/13/2022 3:37 AM] MGpai#4313
testnet should "sync" instantly


[04/13/2022 3:38 AM] MGpai#4313
and mainnet after a couple minutes

[04/14/2022 4:37 PM] cheese#5545
Would someone mind sharing an example json post request for posting to the node swagger API? I'm trying to send an http post request to shutdown the node but I keep getting a 403 with the error 'The supplied authentication is not authorized to access this resource'. 

This is the json I'm posting to the /node/shutdown endpoint: {"api_key":"test"}

This works in the swaggerUI though which is why I think my json is formatted incorrectly


[04/14/2022 4:45 PM] cheese#5545
Sorry, I figured it out. It seems the api_key should be set in the header object, not in the data of the post


[04/14/2022 7:33 PM] MGpai#4313
Thx


[04/14/2022 7:41 PM] dunarea-albastra#6108
can you do the same also for the linux variant? for the .sst file format?


[04/14/2022 10:29 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
Any chance you'd be willing to share your synced ARM data? :0) - I'm hoping to create an easy method for PIs to sync.


[04/14/2022 10:35 PM] glasgowm#9381
Sure, will upload when I'm back at desktop


[04/14/2022 10:36 PM] glasgowm#9381
I don't think it matters once it's synced though? I've restored from non arm sources previously


[04/14/2022 10:47 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
I could be mistaken on the ARM aspect..  I just know something triggers .ldb vs .sst files and PI seems to be .sst.


[04/15/2022 12:27 AM] glasgowm#9381
It's .sst I have, just catching up on latest blocks since last shutdown then will upload

are there any good tutorials for using a node for solo mining?


[04/19/2022 5:54 AM] bonfiggy#3939
I have my node fully setup and synced but was wondering how to use it for solo mining?


[04/19/2022 10:41 AM] flocki#0712
point your mining software at your node ip:port


[04/19/2022 10:42 AM] flocki#0712
but you need the stratum server as well

but that isn't saying much, i'm better with hardwarer vs software lol


[04/19/2022 10:47 AM] flocki#0712
It would be nice if someone in the Ergo space could make something like Kaspa's KDX, wallet/Node/Strat/console in all in one, make solo mining in windows a dream


[04/19/2022 10:48 AM] flocki#0712
if i could program I'd do it


[04/19/2022 10:48 AM] arkadias#4896
yes i wanted to solo mine and just ended up using wooly but if there was a simpler option I would love to solo on my own node


[04/19/2022 10:51 AM] flocki#0712
i found i had to leave the default "ergo_folder" path intact


[04/19/2022 10:51 AM] flocki#0712
then mod the stratum start.js file, and put the node's correct IP, not 127.0.0.1


[04/19/2022 10:51 AM] flocki#0712
then my external rigs could see it

how do i find my nodes ip/port? just the ip of whatever computer i have running the node?


[04/19/2022 9:36 PM] bonfiggy#3939
have u successfully setup and mined to your own solo node?


[04/19/2022 10:10 PM] flocki#0712
yes just the IP for the machine running the node/strat


[04/19/2022 10:10 PM] bonfiggy#3939
do i need to change to my address


[04/19/2022 10:11 PM] bonfiggy#3939
or only mess w the daemon part?


[04/19/2022 10:13 PM] flocki#0712
i would imagine it will depend on if your mining equip is local to the node or remote


[04/19/2022 10:14 PM] bonfiggy#3939
the node and my mining all on same network


[04/19/2022 10:14 PM] flocki#0712
yes


[04/19/2022 10:19 PM] bonfiggy#3939
so i just change both host to my node pc's ip?

[04/19/2022 10:20 PM] bonfiggy#3939
or only the top host part?


[04/19/2022 10:22 PM] flocki#0712
I only changed the daemon host address to match my subnet


[04/19/2022 10:25 PM] bonfiggy#3939
ok i just did that, do i need to mess with my ports or anything


[04/19/2022 10:26 PM] bonfiggy#3939
or do i just run it and use my subnet and the listed port to connect my miners to it?


[04/19/2022 10:27 PM] flocki#0712
give it a try, see if you miner can see the host


[04/19/2022 10:28 PM] bonfiggy#3939
gives me this when i try and run the start file

do i need to change difficulty or do anything about the network difficulty saying NAN


[04/19/2022 11:45 PM] bonfiggy#3939
or where peers says undefined


[04/19/2022 11:45 PM] flocki#0712
dunno


[04/19/2022 11:46 PM] flocki#0712
i googled the console alerts and got nothing back


[04/19/2022 11:46 PM] flocki#0712
i did change difficulty in the strat server setup


[04/19/2022 11:46 PM] bonfiggy#3939
how will i know if my miner is connected to my node and that it is mining solo okay?


[04/19/2022 11:47 PM] bonfiggy#3939
or if i find a block?


[04/19/2022 11:48 PM] flocki#0712
your miner will say its connected, if you config'd it right


[04/19/2022 11:48 PM] flocki#0712
and get jobs from the host


[04/19/2022 11:49 PM] flocki#0712
I dont know if it works for finding a block, cause I personally haven't got any further than where you are at with it


[04/19/2022 11:50 PM] bonfiggy#3939
so should i just put my 127.0.0.1 and the port at the bottom for like enter urls manually? or do i have to set it in the miner itself?

i dont really have the spare hash power to throw at it, only to find out it dosen't work


[04/19/2022 11:50 PM] bonfiggy#3939
i just wanna find a block on my own node


[04/19/2022 11:50 PM] bonfiggy#3939
thatd be sick


[04/19/2022 11:51 PM] flocki#0712
put the ip address of your node machine


[04/19/2022 11:51 PM] flocki#0712
in your miner


[04/19/2022 11:51 PM] bonfiggy#3939
in the video the guy set the ip as 127.0.0.1


[04/19/2022 11:51 PM] bonfiggy#3939
i should do my subnet instead?


[04/19/2022 11:52 PM] flocki#0712
for me, i had the node/strat running on a laptop, I had to use the network ip of the laptop to get my mining rig to see it


[04/19/2022 11:53 PM] flocki#0712
I would assume if the mining gpu was on the same machine as the node, then 127.0.0.1 would work


[04/19/2022 11:53 PM] flocki#0712
being a local loopback address


[04/19/2022 11:54 PM] bonfiggy#3939
ah i mean i am mining on the node but also couple other rigs as well


[04/19/2022 11:54 PM] bonfiggy#3939
so i should set it as subnet of the node machine then


[04/19/2022 11:54 PM] MGpai#4313
no what you are saying does not make sense


[04/19/2022 11:54 PM] bonfiggy#3939
my ipv4 then?


[04/19/2022 11:55 PM] MGpai#4313
1) you cannot set the hero miners ip as they are a stratum themselves


[04/19/2022 11:55 PM] bonfiggy#3939
yeah so id have to set it in the miner config itself then right?


[04/19/2022 11:55 PM] MGpai#4313
ok so we have to be clear


[04/19/2022 11:55 PM] MGpai#4313
where are you putting this ip?


[04/19/2022 11:55 PM] MGpai#4313
the start.js file?


[04/19/2022 11:55 PM] bonfiggy#3939
yes


[04/19/2022 11:56 PM] MGpai#4313
ok so you are looking for the node url


[04/19/2022 11:56 PM] bonfiggy#3939
under main daemon instance


[04/19/2022 11:56 PM] MGpai#4313
yeah


[04/19/2022 11:56 PM] bonfiggy#3939
yeah


[04/19/2022 11:56 PM] bonfiggy#3939
i have it set as 127.0.0.1 atm


[04/19/2022 11:56 PM] MGpai#4313
now are you using mainnet or testnet?


[04/19/2022 11:56 PM] MGpai#4313
and do you have your own node?


[04/19/2022 11:56 PM] bonfiggy#3939
yes have my own node


[04/19/2022 11:56 PM] bonfiggy#3939
and its synced


[04/19/2022 11:57 PM] bonfiggy#3939
and i guess mainnet im just trying to do solo mining on my own node


[04/19/2022 11:57 PM] MGpai#4313
how much hashpower do you have?


[04/19/2022 11:57 PM] bonfiggy#3939
almost 4ghs


[04/19/2022 11:57 PM] MGpai#4313
oh ok good lol


[04/19/2022 11:58 PM] bonfiggy#3939
almost 20 if i point the eth rigs üòâ


[04/19/2022 11:58 PM] MGpai#4313
for the url set it to 127.0.0.1


[04/19/2022 11:58 PM] MGpai#4313
and the port


[04/19/2022 11:58 PM] MGpai#4313
9053


[04/19/2022 11:58 PM] bonfiggy#3939
yeah thats what i got it as


[04/19/2022 11:58 PM] bonfiggy#3939
then do i use my subnet of the node to point the miners?


[04/19/2022 11:59 PM] MGpai#4313

[04/20/2022 12:00 AM] bonfiggy#3939
ive had it running like that on the cmd prompt


[04/20/2022 12:00 AM] MGpai#4313
then start the stratum with `node start.js`


[04/20/2022 12:00 AM] bonfiggy#3939
i did the node start


[04/20/2022 12:00 AM] bonfiggy#3939

[04/20/2022 12:00 AM] MGpai#4313
ok now open the mining software config


[04/20/2022 12:00 AM] bonfiggy#3939
this what it looks like now

[04/20/2022 12:01 AM] MGpai#4313
no


[04/20/2022 12:01 AM] MGpai#4313
put `127.0.0.1:3256`


[04/20/2022 12:01 AM] bonfiggy#3939
ok


[04/20/2022 12:02 AM] bonfiggy#3939
in between the % signs where it says %URL%? or just replace that with 127.0.0.1:3256


[04/20/2022 12:02 AM] MGpai#4313
idk


[04/20/2022 12:02 AM] MGpai#4313
what do you normally have


[04/20/2022 12:03 AM] bonfiggy#3939
i normally use a pool aha


[04/20/2022 12:03 AM] bonfiggy#3939
ill try both


[04/20/2022 12:05 AM] bonfiggy#3939
neither seem to work


[04/20/2022 12:05 AM] MGpai#4313
send me a screenshot with the working pool url inserted


[04/20/2022 12:06 AM] flocki#0712
127.0.0.1 is a local loopback address, and unless the node/start server is on the same machine as the mining software. it won't work


[04/20/2022 12:06 AM] flocki#0712
if you mining rig is a different machine, then you need to point your miner to the machine's ip address that has the start server


[04/20/2022 12:06 AM] MGpai#4313
oh yeah the is the stratum and the mining rig on the same machine?


[04/20/2022 12:06 AM] bonfiggy#3939
i have multiple rigs


[04/20/2022 12:07 AM] bonfiggy#3939
the node is one of them


[04/20/2022 12:07 AM] flocki#0712
what is the ip address of the machine with the node?


[04/20/2022 12:07 AM] bonfiggy#3939
should i use my ipv4 or subnet from the node?


[04/20/2022 12:07 AM] flocki#0712
the ipv4 address of the node machine


[04/20/2022 12:08 AM] MGpai#4313
is the stratum local?


[04/20/2022 12:08 AM] MGpai#4313
and are your rigs local?


[04/20/2022 12:08 AM] bonfiggy#3939
yeah


[04/20/2022 12:08 AM] bonfiggy#3939
all on same network


[04/20/2022 12:08 AM] MGpai#4313
ok what is the private ip of your stratum

[04/20/2022 12:09 AM] bonfiggy#3939
private ip of my stratum? the ip of the node?


[04/20/2022 12:09 AM] MGpai#4313
stratum


[04/20/2022 12:09 AM] flocki#0712
should be the same thing


[04/20/2022 12:10 AM] bonfiggy#3939
the 192 one right


[04/20/2022 12:10 AM] MGpai#4313
node is all set since stratum did not give any problem while connecting


[04/20/2022 12:10 AM] flocki#0712
yes the 192 address


[04/20/2022 12:10 AM] bonfiggy#3939
it said connection refused though


[04/20/2022 12:10 AM] bonfiggy#3939
ok so replace that under the daemon part then right? instead of the 127.0.0.1


[04/20/2022 12:10 AM] MGpai#4313
this looks good to me


[04/20/2022 12:11 AM] MGpai#4313
no


[04/20/2022 12:11 AM] MGpai#4313
use the private ip for the nb miner config


[04/20/2022 12:12 AM] bonfiggy#3939
ah ok but same 3256 port correct?


[04/20/2022 12:12 AM] MGpai#4313
yes


[04/20/2022 12:14 AM] bonfiggy#3939
hmm ok it said this when i tried to connect

[04/20/2022 12:14 AM] bonfiggy#3939
i mean my rig is mining to it i think?


[04/20/2022 12:15 AM] MGpai#4313
yeah I think this should be good


[04/20/2022 12:15 AM] MGpai#4313
but I recommend mining to Testnet first


[04/20/2022 12:15 AM] MGpai#4313
to see if everything is properly configured


[04/20/2022 12:16 AM] MGpai#4313
and its fast to find a block


[04/20/2022 12:16 AM] MGpai#4313
easily within 5 or 10 min with your hashrate


[04/20/2022 12:16 AM] bonfiggy#3939
idk how to switch to testnet


[04/20/2022 12:16 AM] bonfiggy#3939
i also havent gotten any accepted shares


[04/20/2022 12:16 AM] MGpai#4313
I can give you my testnet node to connect to


[04/20/2022 12:17 AM] bonfiggy#3939
ok


[04/20/2022 12:17 AM] MGpai#4313
`159.65.221.38`


[04/20/2022 12:17 AM] MGpai#4313
put that in `start.js`


[04/20/2022 12:18 AM] MGpai#4313
and for port use `9052`


[04/20/2022 12:18 AM] MGpai#4313
and for miner wallet put this `3WwdZXgrRZfsA4tXajYgS2hHgKQhejiewXy3ya4RdvbioGzxUnSM`


[04/20/2022 12:19 AM] MGpai#4313
to see if the funds get sent at all


[04/20/2022 12:19 AM] bonfiggy#3939
ok


[04/20/2022 12:19 AM] MGpai#4313
and you dont need to change anything else


[04/20/2022 12:19 AM] bonfiggy#3939
and then rig to 159.65.221.38:3256?


[04/20/2022 12:19 AM] MGpai#4313
nope


[04/20/2022 12:19 AM] MGpai#4313
dont touch that


[04/20/2022 12:19 AM] bonfiggy#3939
oh ok


[04/20/2022 12:19 AM] MGpai#4313
your stratum is the only thing that connects to the node


[04/20/2022 12:20 AM] MGpai#4313
then your mining software connects to the stratum


[04/20/2022 12:20 AM] bonfiggy#3939
i still dont rly get what a stratum is aha but i put what you told me to in my start.js


[04/20/2022 12:21 AM] bonfiggy#3939
says im connected and mining


[04/20/2022 12:22 AM] bonfiggy#3939
not getting any shares though

[04/20/2022 12:23 AM] bonfiggy#3939
accepted in 2ms dammm


[04/20/2022 12:23 AM] MGpai#4313
I think it should be fine


[04/20/2022 12:23 AM] MGpai#4313
mine for like 5 to 10 min


[04/20/2022 12:24 AM] bonfiggy#3939
im just wondering if my hive settings are messing with it because it makes me select a wallet to use


[04/20/2022 12:24 AM] bonfiggy#3939
but i already have the wallet address in the start.js


[04/20/2022 12:24 AM] MGpai#4313
because we have to make sure it goes to the proper wallet


[04/20/2022 12:24 AM] bonfiggy#3939
block found?

[04/20/2022 12:24 AM] MGpai#4313
yes


[04/20/2022 12:24 AM] MGpai#4313
thats good


[04/20/2022 12:24 AM] bonfiggy#3939
epic aha


[04/20/2022 12:24 AM] MGpai#4313
but I need to see where the rewards go


[04/20/2022 12:24 AM] bonfiggy#3939
ok


[04/20/2022 12:25 AM] bonfiggy#3939
they should go to the address you had me put in right?


[04/20/2022 12:25 AM] MGpai#4313
thats what I need to see...


[04/20/2022 12:25 AM] bonfiggy#3939
its said block found like 3 times now aha


[04/20/2022 12:26 AM] MGpai#4313
did you ever put this `3WwdZXgrRZfsA4tXajYgS2hHgKQhejiewXy3ya4RdvbioGzxUnSM`


[04/20/2022 12:27 AM] MGpai#4313
for wallet address


[04/20/2022 12:27 AM] MGpai#4313
because the node wallet did not get anything


[04/20/2022 12:27 AM] MGpai#4313
so I assume it goes to `3WwdZXgrRZfsA4tXajYgS2hHgKQhejiewXy3ya4RdvbioGzxUnSM`


[04/20/2022 12:27 AM] MGpai#4313
but I am not sure it did go to that when I checked


[04/20/2022 12:28 AM] MGpai#4313

I think it should say `3WwdZXgrRZfsA4tXajYgS2hHgKQhejiewXy3ya4RdvbioGzxUnSM.rig3080ti`


[04/20/2022 12:31 AM] bonfiggy#3939
yeah thats what i was saying about how hive makes me use my wallet


[04/20/2022 12:32 AM] MGpai#4313
can you add another wallet and use that?


[04/20/2022 12:32 AM] bonfiggy#3939
like this thats where the 9fza is coming from

lets see if that works


[04/20/2022 12:34 AM] MGpai#4313
dont see anything just yet...


[04/20/2022 12:34 AM] MGpai#4313
might need to wait a bit


[04/20/2022 12:35 AM] bonfiggy#3939
yeah if not maybe have to remove the wallet/worker name from hive somehow idk


[04/20/2022 12:37 AM] bonfiggy#3939
this is the node console

[04/20/2022 12:38 AM] MGpai#4313
by any chance did did you mine 206864?


[04/20/2022 12:39 AM] bonfiggy#3939
no


[04/20/2022 12:39 AM] bonfiggy#3939
206862 and 206863


[04/20/2022 12:40 AM] bonfiggy#3939
206860 and 206859


[04/20/2022 12:40 AM] bonfiggy#3939
is there a testnet explorer?


[04/20/2022 12:40 AM] MGpai#4313
yes thats what I am checking


[04/20/2022 12:41 AM] bonfiggy#3939
ah gotcha nice


[04/20/2022 12:41 AM] MGpai#4313
but after you changed address the rewards still went to the same address (before you changed)


[04/20/2022 12:41 AM] bonfiggy#3939
what address is it being sent to?


[04/20/2022 12:41 AM] MGpai#4313
thats what I am confused about


[04/20/2022 12:42 AM] MGpai#4313
so in ergo a special mining address is derived


[04/20/2022 12:42 AM] bonfiggy#3939
only thing i can think of is maybe it has to do with how its pulling the wallet and worker name from hive?

[04/20/2022 12:42 AM] MGpai#4313
so this one `mPdcmQkPPvyNAgWXf6HWTKdFDtyvgiDjupk1srLYsQam2dTtj9i39AR61wzCa7FRTdHvXHP34fpu9Zco`


[04/20/2022 12:42 AM] MGpai#4313
I assume this belongs to the 9z... address


[04/20/2022 12:43 AM] MGpai#4313
because it isnt showing up in my balances


[04/20/2022 12:43 AM] bonfiggy#3939
hmm thats weird it shouldnt be linked to that address at all anymore now


[04/20/2022 12:44 AM] MGpai#4313
here change the wallet to this `3Wy67MSRLvjQ4JdfJLoDzsYRAcyUEPCpYhL6kqk1ovLti1KBbqfV`


[04/20/2022 12:44 AM] bonfiggy#3939
the start.js and hive wallets are both set as yours


[04/20/2022 12:44 AM] MGpai#4313
lets see what happens


[04/20/2022 12:44 AM] MGpai#4313
yeah that should be correct


[04/20/2022 12:44 AM] bonfiggy#3939
u want me to change em both to 3Wy67MSRLvjQ4JdfJLoDzsYRAcyUEPCpYhL6kqk1ovLti1KBbqfV now?


[04/20/2022 12:45 AM] MGpai#4313
yes


[04/20/2022 12:46 AM] bonfiggy#3939
ok done


[04/20/2022 12:47 AM] bonfiggy#3939
i would think the rewards would go to whatever address is in the start.js tho no?


[04/20/2022 12:47 AM] MGpai#4313
I am not sure tbh


[04/20/2022 12:47 AM] MGpai#4313
but we need to be sure if you are mining to mainnet


[04/20/2022 12:48 AM] bonfiggy#3939
appreciate this help

[04/20/2022 12:50 AM] bonfiggy#3939

[04/20/2022 12:51 AM] MGpai#4313
tell me once you have a block


[04/20/2022 12:51 AM] bonfiggy#3939
just found 206877


[04/20/2022 12:53 AM] MGpai#4313
wth


[04/20/2022 12:53 AM] MGpai#4313
rewards still went to the same address as before


[04/20/2022 12:54 AM] MGpai#4313
you made sure to save the contents of start.js right?


[04/20/2022 12:55 AM] bonfiggy#3939
yes aha its set as this

[04/20/2022 12:55 AM] bonfiggy#3939
and its still going to mPdcmQkPPvyNAgWXf6HWTKdFDtyvgiDjupk1srLYsQam2dTtj9i39AR61wzCa7FRTdHvXHP34fpu9Zco?


[04/20/2022 12:55 AM] bonfiggy#3939
idk that address at all


[04/20/2022 12:55 AM] bonfiggy#3939
and its nowhere in my start or on my hive lol


[04/20/2022 12:58 AM] MGpai#4313
yeah set it as your worker name


[04/20/2022 12:58 AM] bonfiggy#3939
the wallet address?


[04/20/2022 12:58 AM] MGpai#4313
yeah like it was before


[04/20/2022 12:59 AM] MGpai#4313
3Wy67MSRLvjQ4JdfJLoDzsYRAcyUEPCpYhL6kqk1ovLti1KBbqfV.3080ti


[04/20/2022 12:59 AM] bonfiggy#3939
i could change the name of the worker from 3080ti to the wallet address maybe?


[04/20/2022 12:59 AM] MGpai#4313
something like this


[04/20/2022 12:59 AM] bonfiggy#3939
i got rid of the wallet address from hive so its just the worker name now which is rig3080ti


[04/20/2022 1:00 AM] bonfiggy#3939
i could change rig3080ti to 
3Wy67MSRLvjQ4JdfJLoDzsYRAcyUEPCpYhL6kqk1ovLti1KBbqfV


[04/20/2022 1:00 AM] bonfiggy#3939
maybe?


[04/20/2022 1:00 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
That's the address all mining rewards under your pk will go to. It's still under your wallet, it just goes there so that you can't spend your mining rewards until 72 confirmations have passed (720 on mainnet)


[04/20/2022 1:01 AM] bonfiggy#3939
so we just gotta wait 72 confirmations for it to be distributed then?


[04/20/2022 1:02 AM] MGpai#4313
you see how we changed wallets like 3 times and it still goes to this


[04/20/2022 1:02 AM] MGpai#4313
https://testnet.ergoplatform.com/en/addresses/mPdcmQkPPvyNAgWXf6HWTKdFDtyvgiDjupk1srLYsQam2dTtj9i39AR61wzCa7FRTdHvXHP34fpu9Zco


[04/20/2022 1:02 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
With a new mnemonic each time?


[04/20/2022 1:02 AM] MGpai#4313
yes


[04/20/2022 1:02 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
There's a node call to change what address your mining rewards go to


[04/20/2022 1:03 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
If you mess around with the wallet a lot you need to make that call, or else it will go to the wrong one


[04/20/2022 1:03 AM] bonfiggy#3939
its in the start.js folder tho no?


[04/20/2022 1:03 AM] MGpai#4313
wait does it go to node address by default?


[04/20/2022 1:03 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
It goes to the mining reward contract generated from your node's pk


[04/20/2022 1:03 AM] MGpai#4313
no matter what you change in stratum or mining conf right?


[04/20/2022 1:04 AM] MGpai#4313
because then that would make sense


[04/20/2022 1:04 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Stratum doesn't mean anything, that's just what's used to collect shares. Only way to change that address is to change your nodes pk or to do the api call. Usually changing your nodes pk works, but sometimes it bugs out a little and is stuck on the old one.


[04/20/2022 1:05 AM] bonfiggy#3939
how do i change my node pk?


[04/20/2022 1:05 AM] bonfiggy#3939
and what is a node pk lol


[04/20/2022 1:05 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Public key, or wallet address


[04/20/2022 1:05 AM] bonfiggy#3939
this?

[04/20/2022 1:05 AM] bonfiggy#3939
i only have one address on my node


[04/20/2022 1:06 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Okay so is this on mainnet?


[04/20/2022 1:06 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I would NOT change your pk then


[04/20/2022 1:06 AM] bonfiggy#3939
thats my mainnet address


[04/20/2022 1:06 AM] MGpai#4313
yeah leave it be


[04/20/2022 1:06 AM] bonfiggy#3939
we were testing on testnet tho


[04/20/2022 1:06 AM] MGpai#4313
you should be good to mine on mainnet


[04/20/2022 1:07 AM] bonfiggy#3939
ok


[04/20/2022 1:07 AM] MGpai#4313
all you need to do is change the stratum back to 127.0.0.1:9053


[04/20/2022 1:07 AM] MGpai#4313
and change wallet to your node wallet 9z... everywhere


[04/20/2022 1:07 AM] MGpai#4313
just to be sure


[04/20/2022 1:08 AM] MGpai#4313
although it should not matter


[04/20/2022 1:08 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Yeah make sure you're using the same pk on all your nodes that are being mined to


[04/20/2022 1:09 AM] bonfiggy#3939
so in hive just set the wallet address as my main node address


[04/20/2022 1:10 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
If you want yeah, but if you're not a mining pool then it doesn't really matter.


[04/20/2022 1:10 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
All that matters is the wallet on your node. Thats what gets the rewards, and if you don't have code to distribute the ERG to other miners then whatever you set in hive doesn't make a difference.


[04/20/2022 1:11 AM] bonfiggy#3939
ok yeah i just want the erg i get from a block to go to my node address anyways


[04/20/2022 1:12 AM] bonfiggy#3939

Then you're good, whatever rewards you get will be sent to an address like the one you showed above and will be unlocked after 720 confirmations. After that point it will automatically be included into your node wallet


[04/20/2022 1:13 AM] bonfiggy#3939
ok awesome and itll say block found like it did on testnet now if i find one on mainnnet?


[04/20/2022 1:14 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Yea itll say if you got a block


[04/20/2022 1:17 AM] MGpai#4313
everything should be the same


[04/20/2022 1:17 AM] MGpai#4313
but it will be much harder to find blocks


[04/20/2022 1:37 AM] bonfiggy#3939
how come it says undefined after like everything?

[04/20/2022 1:38 AM] bonfiggy#3939
and it says the diff is 1.90P isn't that way too high?


[04/20/2022 1:42 AM] bonfiggy#3939
im getting like no shares on mainnet


[04/20/2022 1:58 AM] bonfiggy#3939
any idea how to adjust diff?


[04/20/2022 1:59 AM] bonfiggy#3939
i tried messin w this stuff but port 3032 was way too low diff and i couldnt get it to change and 3256 seems to be way too high as im not gettting any shares

[04/20/2022 2:09 AM] bonfiggy#3939
because thats different from my node wallet address


[04/20/2022 2:09 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Yeah that's the mainnet version of the same contract on testnet


[04/20/2022 2:09 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
All your rewards will go there


[04/20/2022 2:09 AM] bonfiggy#3939
i dont have access to that tho?


[04/20/2022 2:09 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
You do, your node wallet automatically includes it


[04/20/2022 2:09 AM] bonfiggy#3939
how would i see it on my wallet


[04/20/2022 2:10 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
It's automatically added to your wallet balance

[04/20/2022 2:10 AM] bonfiggy#3939
so it doesnt matter then?


[04/20/2022 2:12 AM] bonfiggy#3939
also is there a way to change the diff for my miners? I am getting no shares at all on the 3256 port and way too many shares on the 3032 port


[04/20/2022 2:12 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Yeah, it doesn't show in your addresses because the info isn't really that necessary. For you as a user, all you really need to know is that your rewards go there. You can search that address up on the explorer to see exactly when your blocks were mined. Other than that, the node wallet takes care of the rest and adds ERG under that address to your wallet balance


[04/20/2022 2:12 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Are you a pool or solo mining?


[04/20/2022 2:12 AM] bonfiggy#3939
ok as long as it hits my node wallet and solo mining to my own node


[04/20/2022 2:13 AM] bonfiggy#3939
i tried changing these values but nothing changed

[04/20/2022 2:13 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
What stratum are you using?


[04/20/2022 2:13 AM] bonfiggy#3939
my ipv4 of my node and then port 3256


[04/20/2022 2:14 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I mean the software being used to host the stratum


[04/20/2022 2:14 AM] bonfiggy#3939
oh i think node js chocolatey?


[04/20/2022 2:15 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Hmm, haven't worked with that at all. If changing the settings didn't work I'd look it up I guess

[04/20/2022 2:16 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Make sure to restart the stratum and the node when you do it


[04/20/2022 2:16 AM] bonfiggy#3939
oh i wasnt restarting node


[04/20/2022 2:16 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Tbh node shouldn't be that important but try it and see if it helps


[04/20/2022 2:24 AM] bonfiggy#3939
diff still the same


[04/20/2022 2:25 AM] bonfiggy#3939
1.9P


[04/20/2022 2:25 AM] bonfiggy#3939
cant find a share lol


[04/20/2022 2:25 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Yeah 1.9P is crazy high


[04/20/2022 2:25 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I don't see that anywhere in your settings either


[04/20/2022 2:25 AM] bonfiggy#3939
the other miner is 1.898T


[04/20/2022 2:26 AM] MGpai#4313
you know you can solo mine without your own node and stratum right?


[04/20/2022 2:26 AM] bonfiggy#3939
yeah i just wanna find a block from my own node aha


[04/20/2022 2:26 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Yeah I'd just look up issues with the stratum software you're using


[04/20/2022 2:27 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Never worked with the chocolatey so can't really help

[04/20/2022 2:29 AM] bonfiggy#3939
but yeah im editing the start.js from the ergo stratumserver where the difficulty settings are


[04/20/2022 2:29 AM] bonfiggy#3939
but nothing changes


[04/20/2022 2:29 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Ah that makes sense. Well if its just ergostratumserver you can maybe ask mhs_sam. I believe he developed it


[04/20/2022 2:30 AM] bonfiggy#3939
could i possibly have to edit something from the lib folder?

@MGpai I was looking through your synced node repo and really like the idea you had to search for healthy peers! Would it be okay to add that functionality to my project as well? I'd be happy to credit you

@Cheese Enthusiast dont you have any getBlock stratums you can recommend?


[04/20/2022 2:33 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Yea you can use miningcore, its kind of annoying to set up though. You need a postgres db and its more made for pools rather than solo mining


[04/20/2022 2:34 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I think it'd be overkill for a solo-mining setup tbh, but if nothing else works then you could try it out


[04/20/2022 2:36 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I want to eventually make a scala based stratum, I think I could make it really fast and able to process a ton of shares from different connections if I set it up right. Until then, miningcore is pretty good on its own and gets the job done. Also pretty stable once I fixed some of the small errors it had.


[04/20/2022 2:38 AM] MGpai#4313

@bonfiggy turns out the testnet erg did go to my wallet but as  cheesy said, it had to wait 720 blocks to get to my wallet, so I was not aware!

do you know what this means when it says blockhashinvalid: false? and blockdiff:false? is that how its supposed to be or is that bad?

no idea @Cheese Enthusiast ?


[04/22/2022 6:40 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Now idk exactly how its supposed to look but judging by the context seems like its fine. BlockHashInvalid is something you definitely want to be false, and saying blockDiff is false may just be the fact that ur submitting shares and havent found a block candidate yet.


[04/22/2022 6:41 AM] bonfiggy#3939
how do you know what could qualify as a block canidate? like what is it based off of i thought it was completely random


[04/22/2022 6:46 AM] bonfiggy#3939
where do you see the nonce then?


[04/22/2022 6:46 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
When you‚Äôre mining your looking for a random number called the nonce. If the nonce is right, then the hash of the block will be lower than the network target (Essentially 1/netDifficulty). Its very hard to find the right nonce, but very easy to verify whether or not the nonce you have is correct.


[04/22/2022 6:48 AM] bonfiggy#3939
how do you see the hash of the block or the nonce and what it should be?

is it the msg part?


[04/22/2022 6:48 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Not sure if it shows it in your miner, but you can see the nonce used to find a mined block on explorer.


[04/22/2022 6:51 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Your miner probably goes through quite a bit of nonces so it‚Äôd be a lot to show. 1 H/s = 1 nonce per second I‚Äôm pretty sure, so it adds up quick


[04/22/2022 7:26 AM] bonfiggy#3939

no, it crashed just as it was found, so the strat server would not have broadcast it, I did read that node and stratum are pretty sketchy being run under windows, and really need a nix box to run proper.
I just dont have a spare box to spin up a nix instance just for an ergo node.


[04/22/2022 11:06 PM] flocki#0712
i did have a go at running with the same miner and setting as you, but Im still not getting a share response from the server and the server just randomly stops so clearly it not a clean install for some reason.


[04/24/2022 12:40 AM] bambi#6770

[04/24/2022 2:57 AM] MGpai#4313
bad api key means something is wrong with your node generally

The node interface appears to allow a transaction with 14 decimal places and provide a transaction ID. However, it doesn't appear to actually send the funds


[04/24/2022 11:25 PM] $aX#5658
Is there a max amount of decimal places in the amount that can be used


[04/25/2022 12:00 AM] $aX#5658
Can the node interface be coded so that an error message is given when using more than the max number of decimal places in Amount? Right now it gives a transaction ID and says funds are sent


[04/25/2022 12:17 AM] MGpai#4313
10^-9 I believe


[04/25/2022 10:40 PM] $aX#5658
Right, so there is definitely a bug here


[04/26/2022 8:12 AM] Krasavice Blasen#4574
You may be using a more relaxed endpoint like ``wallet/transaction/send``, try ``transactions/check`` to see if it still gives 200

This is a pretty good tutorial - https://docs.ergoplatform.com/node/install/


[04/29/2022 3:41 PM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Hey folks spent 2 days now syncing the node and it‚Äôs been going well but just today I am getting messages such as connection refused:no further information. Or not enough bytes in buffer 97 then it will do that and reconnect a bit and start syncing again.  I also get the unable to define external address warning occasionally. Is this normal? Or is something wrong?


[04/30/2022 1:09 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
How much memory does your machine have?  

Also, that "unable to define external address" may mean that your node can't accept internal connections (but not necessarily! lol)   Do you want your node to be a public node?


[04/30/2022 1:38 PM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Hi sorry for ping no I don‚Äôt want it to be a public node just a local node for me. And my machine has 8 gigs of memory. I also realized I might have mucked it up by force shutting it down.


[04/30/2022 1:42 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
Ah, in that case you can ignore that message.  It doesn't apply to your case üôÇ  

And hmmm, 8gb should be plenty.  I know the node is susceptible to memory spikes at the moment, so my best advice is actually this for the time being - https://discord.com/channels/889630082015043644/889630082015043647/964999115182325780


[04/30/2022 1:44 PM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Oh I see. Ya I wanted to create the node for my local network. So I could test pool creation to mine on. For context it‚Äôs running off of a laptop and I have desktop with my gpu in to mine. Oh I also what channel is that haha? And thank you.


[04/30/2022 1:51 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
That's pretty cool!!!  Let me know if you need pool software, @mhs_sam has a node.js open source version, and I'm hoping to release a Go open source version soon üôÇ

That discord server is the ErgoPi server.  I think you're already a member? - it's been a little slow on the responses there, but I've been trying to get people back on it.

I believe it's possible to run the node on PI, but 1) as a community, we need to figure out how to sync PIs again üôÇ and 2) depending on your needs, you may want to run your node on better hardware (especially if you want to run a pool!)  milliseconds matter in network applications.


[04/30/2022 2:05 PM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820

Always pros and cons when evaluating decentralisation and centralisation for resilience and performance


[05/17/2022 2:51 AM] cheese#5545
Do you know what some of the pros would be though? Would it make the network more decentralized or is that mostly done through mining distribution? Would more full nodes on the network make new nodes coming online sync faster?


[05/17/2022 10:40 AM] HelixEvo#2120
More nodes - More decentralised/More robust... I would not put faster in that sentence though.


[05/17/2022 10:42 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Node different to explorer.. Clients dont have p2p inbuilt, so like calls to api or website then that goes to the explorer I believe. Nodes are like part of the mining/consensus/blockchain layer. Explorer sits on top. Someone can correct me if im wrong


[05/17/2022 2:16 PM] cheese#5545
I was under the impression that the explorer was just a nice user interface on top of a full node. Meaning everything you can query through the explorer could also be done through a local full node.

[05/17/2022 5:30 PM] cheese#5545
I think that usually means the database got corrupted when you see that after stopping and restarting the node multiple times

windows through virtualbox. I just deleted my histroy/state folder and it's now synching


[05/17/2022 5:56 PM] cheese#5545
Nice! I'm running a couple nodes, one is on linux and another on windows. Both have been running very smoothly since full sync and haven't crashed. I have had issues though where my computer crashes while the node is running and that will corrupt the database. Did your node maybe crash or shutdown in a non-clean way?


[05/17/2022 5:57 PM] cheese#5545
I also wonder how much memory your virtualbox has. I see my windows node is currently just over 1.25GB of memory


[05/17/2022 6:10 PM] FlyingPig#2854
I've got it set up with 12gb...probably overkill üôÇ
I was going to run ergodex bots on it, but it looks like docker doesn't play nice with a VM... So i'll have to figure something out.


[05/17/2022 6:11 PM] FlyingPig#2854
I was also going to run a VM with ubuntu to run a cardano node (again, i want to run ergodex bots), but i couldn't get the node up and running, the cardano node instructions were not clear... They have instructions which states "you will see something like this and then you have to change it to something like that".....totally un-userfriendly :p


[05/17/2022 6:13 PM] FlyingPig#2854
And i think my node did crash and i had to restart it. That's probably why


[05/17/2022 6:18 PM] cheese#5545
I'm not as familiar with the cardano node but could you use their Daedalus wallet? That's a full node that's very user friendly but I don't know if it has an API or anything to be queried.


[05/17/2022 6:20 PM] cheese#5545
It might not be as useful to you but I'm currently working on bootstrapping the Ergo node into a windows (and later linux) application that functions similarly to cardanos Daedalus wallet to make it really user friendly for users to use. I have it acquiring all the necessary resources currently (JDK and ergo.jar) and I have it fully syncing. Now I'm working on implementing all the API calls into the user interface.

I have daedalus wallet....But I don't know if that will work with the ergodex (cardano version) bots once up and running. I'll have to look into that.

Bootstrapping an ergo node would be super beneficial! It can be a pain to set up. It would be great if we had an ergo node that was similar and as easy to set up as the daedulus wallet. I'm sure that will come in time.
Personally I can tinker with linux, settings, configs etc but I am NOT a developer, without instructions I fail. But others may want a simple to use node that "just works"

I was ~600k block into syncing and had to restart my computer. when i restarted i saw the new client 4.0.29 and downloaded that as well. 

now I am getting
" ERROR [ctor.default-dispatcher-7] scorex.db.StoreRegistry - Failed to initialize storage: org.fusesource.leveldbjni.internal.NativeDB$DBException: Corruption: checksum mismatch. Please check that directory C:\ergo\.ergo\state\ldb_main exists and is not used by some other active node"

getting a weird issue sending an airdrop-style tx


[05/29/2022 12:05 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
the tx is properly formed and is accepted by the node, but refuses to actually broadcast everything in the tx correctly


[05/29/2022 12:05 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
essentially just sending the miners' fee and none of the actual 'requests' in the transaction


[05/29/2022 12:05 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
on 4.0.30


[05/29/2022 12:06 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
no indication of error or issues, normal node response as it broadcasts the empty tx


[05/29/2022 12:07 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
thought it might be a case of fee being too low but no, even a 0.1 erg fee gives same issue


[05/29/2022 12:10 PM] HazeyOneKenobi#2091
forming a less complex tx (50 outputs, 50 unique assets being sent) instead of 100 of each didn't help either.

Hey. I'm currently running a node on it's own but looking to run an instant of explorer as well.
I'm using the ergo-bootstrap from github.

I have an up to date copy of the node. How can I add that to the node running in docker? I don't have the patience to wait days for it to download. And since it has a habit of crashing now and then I want to be able to restore it quickly.

I'm not very familiar with docker and how it all works.

Alternatively, where do i change the configs for explorer in the bootstrap version to point to a different node on my network?


[05/30/2022 6:36 PM] bombibus#2765
btw it is finally synced now, took 7 days lol

Don‚Äôt think it is maintained anymore. I‚Äôve documented my docker setup, see if it covers your needs: <https://github.com/abchrisxyz/ergo-setup>


[05/31/2022 9:26 PM] FlyingPig#2854
Great! I'll give this a go. 
Curbsideprophet was kind enough to provided a db dump (56gb!!) so that should cover the DB side of things as it looks like it's a mapped volume according to your notes.

I already have a node running so i should be able to point explorer to that.


[05/31/2022 10:37 PM] abchris#8522
To use the dump, you'll have to start the db container only at first, load the dump using `pg_restore`, and then start the grabber.

What OS? If you‚Äôre using something like Linux/Debian there is a package called ‚Äúscreen‚Äù to keep the program running


[06/26/2022 6:40 PM] about_moi#1135
For linux, ok thx dude i'll try it


[06/26/2022 7:18 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
so you can do something like this:
```
# install package
sudo apt install screen

# open a separate screen called "node" but you can name it whatever you want
screen -S node

# launch your node

# to exit screen but keep node running in background
ctrl + a THEN d

# to resume your screen session called "node"
screen -R node 
```

How to systemd enable your Ergo Node to auto start if system reboots and stay running if you disconnect your SSH session:

1) Create a systemd startup script /etc/systemd/system/ergonode.service like this:

`[Unit]
Description=Ergo Node
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=*ANYUSEROTHERTHANROOT*
ExecStart=/path/to/ergonode/ergo_node.sh start
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target`

 *ANYUSEROTHERTHANROOT* should be a non-privileged user that owns the directory and files for the ergo node. Please do not run ergonode as root. It does not need it. You can create a new user by running the following command:

`useradd -m *USERNAMEOFYOURCHOICE*`

2) Once file is created, enable it:

`systemctl enable ergonode`

3) Create the script file /path/to/ergonode/ergo_node.sh that looks like this:

`#!/bin/sh
cd /opt/ergo_node
java -jar -Xmx6G -Dlogback.stdout.level=WARN -Dlogback.file.level=ERR /path/to/ergonode/ergo-4.0.31.jar --mainnet -c /path/to/ergonode/ergo.conf`

Note that *-Xmx6G* is the maximum Java Heap size memory it will consume.  This depends on your machine's available memory, so please adjust accordingly. In this example, it is 6 GB of memory. 

4) Make sure the file you created is owned by the *ANYUSEROTHERTHANROOT* mentioned in step #1.

`chown *ANYUSEROTHERTHANROOT* /path/to/ergonode/ergo_node.sh`

5) Make it executable:

`chmod 755 /path/to/ergonode/ergo_node.sh`

There - your ergo node can be started/stopped manually as well as it will auto start if you restart your machine:

`systemctl start ergonode`
`systemctl stop ergonode`

Another question...I set discover peers to false and known peers to a few select peers I want to connect to. 
After compiling and wiping the peers folder the node still seems to connect and discover random peers that i did not specifiy.

If I add peers via swagger one by one i can force the peers but i wanted to set it in the app itself to only connec to the peers i select.

Am I missing something, how can i force the node to only connect to the peers i select.


[06/28/2022 6:26 PM] ‚≠êFanta‚≠ê#0315
Maybe if you set maxConnections to the number of peers you want it will not try discovering more


[06/28/2022 6:26 PM] ‚≠êFanta‚≠ê#0315
not sure though


[06/28/2022 8:38 PM] error#5683
I don't think you can via the config, but you could limit some outgoing connections via your os firewall, i.e. blocking outgoing connections on specific ports like 9030 except the ones you want to connect to. You might block most, but not all, as not everyone is using the default port.


[06/29/2022 3:29 PM] liquid_phase#4605
does this restart node on any failure including crashes? or just restarts


[06/29/2022 3:30 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Negative, it‚Äôs only for managing start/stop but maybe someone with more systemd experience could chime in.  You can probably Google some info on systemd to handle crashes and auto restart. I personally don‚Äôt know about it

yeah the last time i tested was for 4.0.31 node release and it depends on how much memory you have available. with 32gb microSD it took ~6 days but ~2 days with 256gb

[07/01/2022 9:02 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
I was wondering about the internal node miner, I'm aware of the flag for turning it on and off in the ergo.conf for using an external miner but was curious as if it can mine the main chain or a little more info on how it works and if the below would be possible.


[07/01/2022 9:03 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
Now I figure the hash a single node could probably do is extremely low, which is understandable, however I would be curious to know if these internal node miners could potentially combine their hashrate into a pool or in a smart contract and mine the main chain and be rewarded as such. Independently from a gpu mining pool or current solo miner.


[07/01/2022 9:03 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
If so, what this could potentially lead to or do is split any blocks mined by these nodes evenly between the participating nodes based on their uptime during each epoch (paid at the end of the epoch) that had this specific flag enabled within the conf file. People are always looking to add an incentive for node operators and a way to further make it harder for 51% attacks while increasing decentralization. Sometimes other chains may require you to stake coins to acheive this, not something I particullary agree with however I do agree with the potential (however small) for node operators to be rewarded for their contribution to the network and uptime.


[07/01/2022 9:05 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
Now I wouldn't expect the hash rate from the combined nodes to be too much so it wouldn't really be taking much rewards from the gpu miners (not by a specified % at all but rather just based on luck) since I would guess the node pool would maybe be able to find a block or 2 a month, however something is better than nothing. This would also incentivize people to operate nodes and join the node pool, simply by running a node, keeping it online and with the proper flag set in the ergo conf.


[07/01/2022 9:05 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
I would guess the current internal miner is somehow using the machines RAM and CPU so obviously a better machine may have slightly more hash rate. Would something like this even be possible? It's really not about the nodes being able to get a ton of blocks or being profitable, right now if you simply run a node it's not profitable so this isn't about changing that to make it profitable it would be more about a small potential incentive which could make 51% attacks harder, increase decentralization by onboarding more nodes and keeping them online and giving the nodes the potential to split any block rewards that they should find.


[07/01/2022 9:06 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
Now since these blocks would be split evenly through the nodes, if someone did decide to add additional hashrate to their node via CPU or GPU, the group of node operators may benefit as a whole, but the individual would not benefit directly as the reward is evenly split based solely on the nodes uptime during the epoch and not hashpower, or it would simply not be possible to add additional other than the installed internal miner as is. This may also help in times when the block rewards are small or if a time ever comes where it's simply not feasible to mine with gpu's due to various things like production or energy costs etc, while maintaining some level of security.

Hi, I'm running into a rather bizzare issue. Trying to register a scan, but once the scan is registered, the ergotree value seems to be messed up. I'm running v5.0 testnet.  When I list scans, it shows the "equals" predicate's value as 100404020400 instead of the actual full ErgoTree.  Here's the scan sent to /scan/register endpoint ```{
  "scanName": "Pool Box Scan",
  "trackingRule": {
    "args": [
      {
        "assetId": "f0aa270b0830411b94f41bc16c3ed89e345bc67e9d3328659881b9df237d390b",
        "predicate": "containsAsset"
      },
      {
        "predicate": "equals",
        "value": "1004040204000e20c97883afac2a5d97fa8ff3f08c069b351962217337c2ec00b80f7ba1094ee8f10e205868cee35f3f5dd0982abce2ba0796f385d4d7cd1c4862a1caa145fda3d09eafd801d6018cb2db6308b2a473000073010001d1ec93720173029372017303"
      }
    ],
    "predicate": "and"
  }
}

If anyone could try, please try registering this scan on your node, if it has same issue I can open an issue on ergo github

it seems so yes, my node is a bit behind and it's not syncing either, all the other nodes seem to be at 464842


[07/28/2022 2:08 AM] dusek#6153
my node seems to keep sending a Sync message to other nodes and then doesn't do anything


[07/28/2022 2:08 AM] dusek#6153
so maybe other nodes are also stuck?


[07/28/2022 5:57 AM] dusek#6153
the testnet started getting blocks again, but it seems to have died again. everytime i refresh testnet explorer the hashrate estimate keeps going down, so maybe nobody is mining right now


[07/28/2022 7:13 AM] dusek#6153
I was wondering, is there any mining pool for testnet? I could contribute 30-40 MH/s periodically, since blocks are taking quite a while right now. I wasn't able to get mining setup on my node though

for the running node i think 4g? but to sync you need a bit more i think, so "-Xmx8g" to the jvm oughta do it

hey, quick question, when setting up the node by mistake set up also a Mnemonic password, is there any way to remove it?


[07/29/2022 4:23 PM] MGpai#4313
stop the node and delete the wallet folder in `.ergo`


[07/29/2022 4:23 PM] MGpai#4313
and initiate the wallet again with seed


[07/29/2022 4:24 PM] MGpai#4313
btw mnemonic password and wallet password are two separate things


[07/29/2022 4:24 PM] MGpai#4313
if the mnemonic was created with a mnemonic password then you will have to generate a new mnemonic itself

What‚Äôs the difference between using port 9030 and 9053? The only one that works for me is 9053 when accessing node remotely.


[07/31/2022 8:54 AM] pragmaxim#0778
@kushti @greenhat I found a bug related to `publicUrl` https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/issues/1788 ... bit of a mystery to me, will fix eventually

The lower numbers are for P2P comms. The higher number ports are for front end comms to the node

[07/31/2022 9:37 AM] HelixEvo#2120
What‚Äôs the publicurl meant to be doing? A lot of the publicurl values if it does get the individual IPs correct won‚Äôt be usable from some nodes saying they are on reserved networks or the port 9053 not being open on firewalls


[07/31/2022 9:38 AM] pragmaxim#0778
nodes with rest api open to the world, so you can for instance use them to bootstrap something like explorer, etc.


[07/31/2022 9:39 AM] HelixEvo#2120
So any IP from the /connected page I should be able to get to the 9053 port?


[07/31/2022 9:40 AM] pragmaxim#0778
yeah you can use the `restApiUrl` if it is defined and it should be publicly accessible, others are not unless the deployer made a mistake and let the ports open somewhat intentionally


[07/31/2022 9:44 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Hmmm tried a few from that list. None work. Plus you have done 169.254 networks which will never work


[07/31/2022 9:45 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Maybe port scan the list of peers into final list of validated open peers?


[07/31/2022 9:57 AM] pragmaxim#0778
for me they work : 
https://ergo-mainnet.zackbalbin.com/peers/connected  
https://node.zoomout.io/peers/connected


[07/31/2022 9:58 AM] pragmaxim#0778
actually all work, so there is nothing unexpected


[07/31/2022 9:59 AM] HelixEvo#2120
You are going to http://168.119.146.45:9053 as an example?


[07/31/2022 10:01 AM] pragmaxim#0778
I go to here http://213.239.193.208:9053/peers/connected and grap those with `restApiUrl` defined and then use these addresses


[07/31/2022 10:05 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Ahhh I see the values on a few now. So the URL is not actually to the peer IP it‚Äôs just a value saying where an external endpoint is available

[07/31/2022 10:07 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Where is that set in the conf? I have an endpoint I can put in

[07/31/2022 10:13 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Ahh ok, so I‚Äôd have to compile my own jar file and not use the prebuilt I guess?  No way of putting in ergo.conf?


[07/31/2022 12:14 PM] HelixEvo#2120
I‚Äôve 4 endpoints available to me now, so if anyone wants to expose their node api port without having to open their firewall or port forward then let me know. You will need to run cloudflared on the node and I will supply a token ID. Let me know geo location of node also for better latency.


[08/01/2022 2:13 AM] Balvand#0653
what are the minimum requirements to run a full node?


[08/01/2022 6:36 AM] HipHopBlond#9606
a potato computer that will run 24/7, even a Pi can run the node, pretty lightweight, it does take 20-30GB's though after syncing


[08/01/2022 8:22 AM] pragmaxim#0778
you can add this config to ergo.conf, I was just passing a reference


[08/01/2022 11:11 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Great thanks. I‚Äôll look at the file to see if I can see where to put it


[08/01/2022 12:46 PM] HelixEvo#2120
This does not seem to work.. Any pointers? The ones advertising currently seem to be using their own built jar files I think..

        }


[08/01/2022 1:14 PM] pragmaxim#0778
this should definitely work, the ergo.conf overrides the built-in config ... I would remove the `/` from the end though


[08/01/2022 1:16 PM] pragmaxim#0778
it takes a while before your node syncs with others ... however https://ergonode.blocpow.io/info should contain `restApiUrl` in the output immediately after deploy as we just grab it from configuration ... if you query different node for `peers/connected`, it might not be there yet because they have not synced yet


[08/01/2022 3:28 PM] pragmaxim#0778
@HelixEvo let me know if it worked, it must be some kind of misconfiguration if not


[08/01/2022 3:45 PM] error#5683
you seem to be running an old version of the node: 4.0.31, try at least 4.0.35 or the just released version 4.0.36. It definitely works with just the config line, I run two of them of docker with just this config change

[08/01/2022 4:48 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Thanks both.. Looks to of been the version. Its 4.0.36 now. Tried the same on the testnet node, that does not seem to report it in /info... Maybe its not part of client v5.0?


[08/01/2022 6:21 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Out of interest. Is there a value returned in /info or /panel that will report on how far a node is synced? I‚Äôm thinking on the health check side of things. A flag to know if a node is fully synced or out of sync?


[08/01/2022 7:29 PM] error#5683
I've been comparing fullHeight with headersHeight in my healthcheck script. When fullHeight falls behind headersHeight by a two digit number, it is usually stuck and a node restart is required. It doesn't cover every scenario like a complete network outage where headersHeight will not get incremented, but it covers most of the node is stuck scenarios.


[08/01/2022 8:18 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Yeah.. I was thinking something similar, but will have to code a worker I think to get an intelligent health check back.


[08/02/2022 4:26 PM] pragmaxim#0778
but I can see the blocpow node in here http://213.239.193.208:9053/peers/connected so it worked


[08/02/2022 4:29 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Yes, I see it in local node /info now. Testnet works different I guess as same changes don‚Äôt show the public url in testnet node /info

[08/02/2022 8:50 PM] ebron99#4960
on Ergonodes.net it says, "*if you have the ability to host a node, please do so. And do not forget to port-forward it to become accessible for incoming connections.
The difference between reachable (port-forwarded, usually 9030) and other nodes are that when new nodes are joining the network, they can only connect to nodes that are reachable*."      Can someone explain to me what  that means, and how to do it for Mainnet node?  is that the same as setting "PeerDiscovery" Flag to true?


[08/02/2022 10:29 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Joining the network the new node has to initially make the first contact, so has to be to a node that accepts the connection, however, your first port of call will be to allow the connection to the server via your firewall/router


[08/02/2022 10:30 PM] HelixEvo#2120
You don't have to accept connections, nodes will be part of the network only using their outbound connections as long as a few seed nodes are available


[08/03/2022 12:12 AM] ebron99#4960
Thanks for the explanation. Appreciate it.


[08/03/2022 10:05 AM] pragmaxim#0778
it should be network agnostic, pls let me know if you are sure that it does not work on testnet


[08/03/2022 11:59 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Same conf file format. Deffo does not show the public url in testnet node /info


[08/03/2022 1:48 PM] pragmaxim#0778
I quadruple-checked that it is completely network agnostic ... `/info` Object literally contains `restApiUrl = settings.scorexSettings.restApi.publicUrl` and `--testnet -c ergo.conf`  sources the `ergo.conf` and overrides the defaults ... it works for me so I did not reproduce that

i have 2x 5900x and 2x m1 minis (had them for other purposes, but conveniently they are efficient miners but low power)


[08/09/2022 7:00 AM] Setvin#2532
with the tornado thing I think its almost time to not mention monero again lol


[08/09/2022 7:00 AM] Setvin#2532
I remember a day when people wouldnt put a monero bumper sticker on their car


[08/09/2022 7:00 AM] Balvand#0653

[08/10/2022 8:52 AM] Pgr456#1839
This is probably not a java issue. You are writing that you tried running the node on an old hard drive with only 30gb of space. It is more likely that your drive is corrupted or has bad sectors corrupting the block storage


[08/10/2022 4:34 PM] Setvin#2532
Have you taken a peek over at the issue tab on github


[08/10/2022 4:34 PM] Setvin#2532
This is a systemic issue

[08/10/2022 4:36 PM] Setvin#2532
Maybe an older version works better but the node has a huge memory leak

[08/10/2022 5:08 PM] Setvin#2532
Dont worry the best answer is you are doing it wrong and nothing wrong with the java


[08/10/2022 5:14 PM] Pgr456#1839
Java can in some cases be the issue but sometimes it can be hardware or system related issues as well. I have version 4.0.34 and 4.0.31 running stable for weeks now maybe you can try that version?


[08/10/2022 5:15 PM] Pgr456#1839
And if your node has any issues providing the logs could be helpful as well so one of the node developers can have a look at them. You can find them in the .ergo folder


[08/10/2022 5:17 PM] Setvin#2532

Probably not related.. But all who got a stuck node.. Do you use the pre-built jar file or build yourself?


[08/11/2022 12:00 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Do we know how many nodes it effected? @kushti Is it worthy of an RCA?

Is that a payout to miner for block from the contract holding remaining ERG?

This makes no sense. I've reverted ergo.conf back to default (mining = false) and I am still locked out. Changing the hash does not affect my API key.


[08/11/2022 9:55 PM] Balvand#0653
I fixed it. As with most things that "make no sense" it is user error: my problem was having the ergo {....} block in the config include the API section instead of having scorex{....restAPI{....hash...}} be at the top of the file.

[08/12/2022 4:56 AM] MGpai#4313
4) replace `.ergo`  folder in the node folder with the folder you just uncompressed


[08/12/2022 7:39 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Do you by chance have a .ergo folder for Linux available?

Repo is meant for linux


[08/12/2022 1:01 PM] ziggomatic#9335
java, or more specifically the jvm, can be problematic. however, many mission critical services worldwide are run on it, so i wouldn't point a finger at it specifically. the node does have some warts, for sure, and those are being ironed out gradually. i ran a sync yesterday to see if i experienced any issues


[08/12/2022 1:05 PM] ziggomatic#9335
seems i can't upload images to this channel. i started my sync at 20:48 and was done at 01:34, so ~5 hours for a complete sync.


[08/12/2022 1:09 PM] ziggomatic#9335
sync was run on a ¬£600 laptop i bought last year (ryzen 4600u + 16gb ram + nvme ssd), running opensuse tumbleweed, jdk 18 (not recommended), node 4.0.38. i passed -Xmx8g to jvm since sync is slightly hungry, but mem usage was consistent throughout


[08/12/2022 1:35 PM] ziggomatic#9335
what's also interesting is the db is only 12gb


[08/12/2022 2:46 PM] ziggomatic#9335
in the future it may be possible to run ergo node natively via graalvm instead of jvm, and perhaps a rust node will pop up at some point too. but this is just speculation

I know someone has some git available for node sync.. I was just playing about and put up this which, once unzipped contains a fresh .ergo folder you can just copy in. No wallet etc is setup on it, its just fresh sync. Block Height is approx 820000 (https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafybeignn6lc4shdlh6vngtmh5divgqm3zwqh2urkpgiaqz75paonzrbdy)

Make sure you use the latest testnet release: https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/releases/tag/5.0-RC2 and if you have set this according to the guide:
    peerDiscovery = false
remove it. The guide probably was not updated. Also remove the knowPeers section of the conf because the current testnet is not using p2p port 9020 (it is now 9021) anymore. Here is a example conf that should work for testnet:
ergo {
  node {
    mining = false
  }
}

scorex {
 restApi {
    # Hex-encoded Blake2b256 hash of an API key.
    # Should be 64-chars long Base16 string.
    # below is the hash of the string 'hello'
    # replace with your actual hash
    apiKeyHash = "324dcf027dd4a30a932c441f365a25e86b173defa4b8e58948253471b81b72cf"

Bascially I have one node and i'm running a PPLNS node on it and I would also like to run a solo pool on it, but i want each of them to have their own address.

I'm still having walletHeight/wallet sync issues on testnet. Even tried deleting whole .ergo folder, reimport wallet, and fully resynced node. Not sure what's up.

Don't think it should make any difference, but I've been doing all the wallet commands directly through the API instead of the UI (I'm on a headless server).

Update: I got it fixed. My node's headers were synced, but fullHeight wasn't yet synced.


[08/24/2022 9:57 PM] Prohashing-Steven#6510
Normally, does the wallet start syncing and gaining height after wallet initialization?

[08/26/2022 11:34 AM] mhs_sam#1471
block time in the current testnet is 5 seconds that is very low, resulting in lots of forks and being out of sync. @kushti any recommendations here?


[08/26/2022 11:35 AM] mhs_sam#1471
we have some plans to restart the testnet in the near future with more conservative block time but it will take some time.


[08/26/2022 11:36 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Where is the blocktime set? Is it in the v5.0 code?


[08/26/2022 11:38 AM] mhs_sam#1471
I'm not sure atm. Nothing to do with 5 however, since block time in mainnet will not change. It is just a configuration for current testnet in order to facilitate some tests. It will be changed in near future in the next testnet

[08/26/2022 11:40 AM] mhs_sam#1471
if you need testnet for your dev stuff, you can use the current testnet (5 sec blocks) or start your own local test or mainnet if necessary.


[08/26/2022 11:41 AM] mhs_sam#1471
also, if you mine on the public testnet nodes, the issues will be mitigated.


[08/26/2022 12:09 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Think it‚Äôs just good to have the testnet running smooth. To me I see it as a staging area for pushes to mainnet. I‚Äôm probably seeing it wrong though


[08/26/2022 12:10 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Like any node code updates, testnet should be where they are first then moved to mainnet after testing. But that‚Äôs just from where I come from


[08/26/2022 1:21 PM] HelixEvo#2120
On a rant day today, so please take this as a suggestion and nothing more, as the work you guys do is really tidy.. However what about this idea, bearing in mind I come from an older gen than some of you..

- Testnet in my view should be an iteration of code newer than Mainnet
- Doing this gives the devs a testnet to test their code and also load tests the proposed mainnet code
- This would be instead of running code changes and then that code going straight into mainnet
- Basically testnet being the staging area for next release of mainnet code
- All I see from the outside in is code proposed, signed and pushed for mainnet release instead of the flow, proposed code changes, released into the wild on testnet, given like a week or two of no issues, then that code is released for mainnet consumption.

Said it before, would like testnet provide two services - testing for devs for the tx's etc, but also footer for the mainnet releases. We have nothing to fully test releases before mainnet is exposed to new client code do we?


[08/27/2022 10:57 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I am pretty sure devnet is used for that and other small changes to the reference client


[08/27/2022 11:01 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I mean I could be wrong but what else would devnet be used for?


[08/27/2022 11:06 PM] HelixEvo#2120
How‚Äôs it working now? I generally see reference clients released. But they could be on mainnet before anyone puts it on testnet? I‚Äôm sure someone puts it on test net before public release?

Wondering if it could be locked to testnet initially then making public mainnet client if testnet showing no problems


[08/27/2022 11:07 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
There is another network called devnet, it has a specific config you can find in the repo. I assume that is what is used to test reference client updates.


[08/27/2022 11:07 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Like I said tho, could be wrong but idk what else it'd be used for


[08/27/2022 11:08 PM] HelixEvo#2120
But why would you not have the code tested where people are using the product. Like testnet? Surely that‚Äôs where most problems would be exposed?


[08/27/2022 11:09 PM] HelixEvo#2120
I don‚Äôt know either. I could be missing a big part of info. Just thinking out loud


[08/27/2022 11:12 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Keep in mind that unit tests also exist within the repo, and those must all pass before a reference client update is set out. That already ensures the majority of bugs (especially breaking ones) do not make it out. 

But I also don't know all of the info. I think that for smaller updates testing on a small, mostly private network would be fine though. Consensus-level changes are always put onto testnet which is where large scale public testing is needed the most.


[08/27/2022 11:19 PM] HelixEvo#2120

Hey. I'm deploying 3 nodes, 1 each in US, Asia and EU. All 3 share the same ergo.conf and have 9030 whitelisted on ufw. Telnet connects to the node correctly. However, on one node, namely the EU one I have 150-ish peers, incoming and outgoing. On the other 2 nodes I only have 30 outgoing and 0 incoming. Can anyone point me in the right direction with this? All nodes are fully synced


[08/28/2022 9:53 AM] Attila#3944
```telnet 89.58.50.104 9030```
```telnet 138.2.46.253 9030```
```telnet 129.146.113.238 9030```


[08/28/2022 9:54 AM] Attila#3944
EU, Asia and US respectively


[08/28/2022 10:50 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Are the IPs being reported out properly. I seem to recall some setting you have to do if on cloud to report out the public ip and not local


[08/28/2022 10:55 AM] Attila#3944
how do I do that?


[08/28/2022 10:55 AM] Attila#3944
the EU node is a root server with netcup, the other 2 are oracle always free instances


[08/28/2022 10:55 AM] Attila#3944
I mean the netcup server is a cloud instance too, albeit it has 100% dedicated resources in all aspects

```network {

[08/28/2022 2:04 PM] Attila#3944
I didn't use your script in the end. The issue got solved by setting up my ergo.conf like this:
```ergo {
    directory = "/home/attila/ergo"
    node {
        mining = false
    }
    wallet.secretStorage.secretDir = "/home/attila/ergo/wallet/keystore"
}


scorex {
    restApi {
        apiKeyHash = "<Api Key Hash>"
    }
    network {
        bindAddress = "0.0.0.0:9030"
        declaredAddress = "<ip of the node>:9030"
    }
}```


[08/28/2022 2:07 PM] MGpai#4313
This is great, I like using known Peers since you can connect to healthy, synced nodes which seems to be good for stability


[08/28/2022 2:09 PM] Attila#3944

[08/28/2022 2:21 PM] Attila#3944
If I can get ErgoMixer going on all these nodes I'll set up a proximity based load balancer for that


[08/28/2022 2:34 PM] MGpai#4313
I assume these are public, so anyone can use them?


[08/28/2022 2:53 PM] Attila#3944
yep, just let me set it up


[08/28/2022 2:56 PM] Attila#3944
you should be able to see the panel on https://ergo.eutxo.net/panel


[08/28/2022 2:57 PM] Attila#3944
I doubt it makes sense to expose this there but I 9053 should be good

on https://ergo.eutxo.net

[08/28/2022 5:07 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Diff is very low, I was using the default internal node miner, so shouldn't be hard to get it moving


[08/28/2022 5:07 PM] 6directions#1089
so could be done without a GPU?

So I changed all the chain settings, then run the node. It throws an error about genesisStateDigestHex being incorrect (to be exact it says `Assertion Failed`). Right before the exception, it prints out the correct genesis digest (as a hex string). Simply copy the digest, and paste it into `genesisStateDigestHex` in your config.


[08/29/2022 9:20 AM] HelixEvo#2120
How much potch to get this going?


[08/29/2022 1:32 PM] MGpai#4313
Takes like 2 min to do because it's all just docker


[08/29/2022 1:34 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Do you have compose file and the containers?


[08/29/2022 1:39 PM] MGpai#4313
Yes everything is done

1) this is incredible, thank you.
2) how do you change bloknet's node API to point to this or a self hosted explorer? cc/ @Cheese Enthusiast

[08/29/2022 2:06 PM] MGpai#4313
You have to change the master node(s) in that


[08/29/2022 2:08 PM] 6directions#1089
Ok hold on


[08/29/2022 2:08 PM] 6directions#1089
Is this for pointing the testnet explorer to the testnet Cheesey made?


[08/29/2022 2:09 PM] 6directions#1089
(I just took a look at the Readme)


[08/29/2022 2:12 PM] MGpai#4313
Yes, however you need to change the master nodes I just mentioned


[08/29/2022 2:13 PM] MGpai#4313
And then follow readme


[08/29/2022 2:15 PM] 6directions#1089
Ok that makes sense. But you know how from the node's panel there is a link to the explorer? Does this take care of that too or does that require a change in the node's config? Looking through this readme it  seems like this is just for configuring and setting up the explorer, but maybe I'm missing something?


[08/29/2022 2:16 PM] HelixEvo#2120
That link will be done in Cheesecakes git under the code of the node I‚Äôd imagine


[08/29/2022 2:17 PM] 6directions#1089
That's what I figured


[08/29/2022 2:17 PM] 6directions#1089

I'm just realizing how much functionality ErgoMixer has built in. I was thinking I would host the service on a node but as transaction history can be exported it would make the whole operation obsolete.


[08/29/2022 5:39 PM] Attila#3944

I cannot use my gpu to mine since it is not synced for some reason


[08/29/2022 6:06 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
You are almost done, the last thing needed is 1 other node to connect to the one you have. You can do this locally by running another node on the same computer, but be careful to change the restApiPort and the p2p port on the second node because two nodes cannot be using the same ports.


[08/29/2022 6:07 PM] MGpai#4313
let me try thanks


[08/29/2022 6:07 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
Also in the second node, set `knownPeers` to equal `0.0.0.0:P2P_PORT_HERE` before starting it so it autoconnects


[08/29/2022 6:07 PM] MGpai#4313
yes

[08/29/2022 7:20 PM] MGpai#4313
can you send me your config file with everything in it?


[08/29/2022 7:21 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
The mining part of your config seems incorrect then, that's the last piece pretty much. Check if what you have matches what I replied to


[08/29/2022 7:21 PM] MGpai#4313
well the first node has the complete config with all the chain rules


[08/29/2022 7:22 PM] MGpai#4313
I just copied it over for the second node with changes so I can mine


[08/29/2022 7:22 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
I wouldn't do that tbh. Take your config and copy it into one of the default ones in a forked Ergo repo, then build the jar.


[08/29/2022 7:23 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
`-c` is usually used for smaller configs that override the parts you need to change


[08/29/2022 7:24 PM] MGpai#4313
yes let me try building


[08/29/2022 8:16 PM] UnlikelyChungus#7656
Hi, I asked in one of the other channels but maybe this is a better spot. I'm trying to get solo mining started on my node but I think I'm having an issue with the config file. When I try to startup the stratum it gives me an issue with "paymentProcessing" and tells that the cluster cannot start


[08/29/2022 8:35 PM] HelixEvo#2120
What kind of resources you have to hand? Obviously the node is the starting point.


[08/29/2022 8:36 PM] MGpai#4313
@Cheese Enthusiast is this what you edit before building? https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/blob/5.0-testnet/src/main/resources/testnet.conf

I see. TIL üòÅ


[08/30/2022 4:05 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
So to bring it all together, I believe the fee address requires that the ERG goes to the miner reward contract, which itself depends on `minerRewardDelay` set in the config. And that's why we now have to restart the chain lol.

what is the purpose of the minerRewardDelay, anyways?

I see one pool has it at 72 instead of 720 -- does this have any other trade-off?


[08/30/2022 6:09 AM] MGpai#4313
this is the pool's off-chain choice


[08/30/2022 6:10 AM] MGpai#4313
the pool just uses their old, built up funds to pay the miners


[08/30/2022 6:10 AM] MGpai#4313
in reality the freshly mined ERG is only available after 720 blocks


[08/30/2022 6:13 AM] Balvand#0653
oh I see, so it is a network level delay but the pool can make the decision to be liquid enough for X amount of blocks


[08/30/2022 6:13 AM] Balvand#0653

[08/31/2022 9:57 PM] pragmaxim#0778
@kushti Guava cache wraps OOM exception into unchecked `ExecutionError` and it is then considered `NonFatal` so it triggers validation error -> invalid modifiers -> node gets stuck


[08/31/2022 9:59 PM] pragmaxim#0778
I finally found the reason behind node getting stuck for many people, it always happens when node ran Out Of Memory which usually happens in that Guava cache and some block gets incorrectly invalidated

@kushti we should consider different caching library as we'd have to have special handling for all cache calls and catch that `ExecutionError` and check if the `cause` exception is not OOM Error ü§¶

@MGpai if spinning up our own version of https://github.com/mgpai22/ergo-explorer-testnet, how do we make it point to the new bloknet testnet? is it with this value? https://github.com/mgpai22/ergo-explorer-testnet/blob/main/explorer-backend.conf#L8

also some clarification on this value https://github.com/mgpai22/ergo-explorer-testnet/blob/main/docker-compose.yml#L137-L138
is this the address where this explorer will be accessible to the public?

You point this to any bloknet node

kk, figured but thanks for validating!


[09/03/2022 2:34 PM] MGpai#4313
You point this to the bloknet explorer api

if the miner reward delay is 720 I dont think anyone has any yet? üôÇ

WHOOPS, good call out üôÉ


[09/03/2022 4:20 PM] 6directions#1089
So even without mining pools, the protocol manages keeping track of mining rewards and of distributing them every 720 blocks?


[09/03/2022 4:28 PM] Luivatra#9076
Tbh no idea


[09/03/2022 4:52 PM] MGpai#4313
720 blocks is protocol level not mining pool level


[09/03/2022 4:53 PM] MGpai#4313
mining pool can do whatever they want


[09/03/2022 4:53 PM] MGpai#4313
but even they will only get the freshly mined ergs after 720 blocks


[09/03/2022 4:53 PM] 6directions#1089
right


[09/03/2022 4:53 PM] 6directions#1089
the question is if the protocol automatically handles keeping track of who mined each block and distributing rewards accordingly every 720 blocks


[09/03/2022 5:33 PM] MGpai#4313
I think more so than getting distributed 720 blocks, it gets unlocked


[09/03/2022 5:33 PM] MGpai#4313
think of ERG sitting in a time lock contract which you can only access after x blocks


[09/03/2022 5:46 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548

no he said `min 30` ie 1m30s


[09/03/2022 7:41 PM] MGpai#4313
@Luivatra ^


[09/03/2022 7:46 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
1m30s is still quick enough to activate since voting starts 4096

But how many epochs before activation?


[09/03/2022 7:50 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
A voting epoch is 128 blocks, I think its 8 epochs?


[09/03/2022 7:51 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
A good way to check this is to see how fast 5.0 was activated on the original chain

Thats the ERG emission contract


[09/04/2022 1:08 AM] 6directions#1089
does that mean all ERG is already mined and just sitting in that contract, waiting to be released?


[09/04/2022 1:11 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
All ERG is already minted, and the contract allows spending the emission box if the transaction spending it is included in a mined block, and if the outputted miner reward is of the correct emission amount.

interesting, I didn't know that.
I've only ever mined with a mining pool that distributed rewards every X amount of time.
If mining solo, does the protocol automatically send you rewards, or do you have to initiate a tx to claim them?


[09/04/2022 3:00 PM] MGpai#4313
auto


[09/04/2022 3:01 PM] MGpai#4313

Ok random question....
I'm seeing this in the logs
`No fee proposition found in txs List`
it's from line 859 of CandidateGenerator
https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/blob/07f276894e3cf12940099ad015d7daaff3f0d16f/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/mining/CandidateGenerator.scala#L859

It doesn't look like a failure, but I don't know if it's failing into the loop where the else is 'current->invalidTxs'

The node is online and has been for 3 days, and in that time ( we've been mining to it) we've hit two blocks.

Hello, is here someone who knows how to make node start on startup in Ubuntu? I'm trying since yesterday and no progression yet.


[09/06/2022 7:26 PM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
I think you need to go google how to make a systemd unit file.


[09/06/2022 7:37 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
I think it‚Äôs pinned somewhere here. I shared this before. If you can‚Äôt find it give me till later today and I‚Äôll share the systems startup and associated script


[09/06/2022 7:50 PM] MGpai#4313
Use Docker


[09/06/2022 8:14 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Docker is a terrible medium for these nodes. Sorry. Apps highly dependent on Disk I/o are not best served in docker.  I know you guys use it, but it gives us continued sync issues over and over.


[09/06/2022 8:24 PM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
That's really interesting to hear.  I didn't know that there was a lot of file IO with the ergo node.


[09/06/2022 8:31 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
I guess everyone‚Äôs mileage varies. But during peak times you can see that

It‚Äôs these peaks that can cause sync issues


[09/06/2022 8:38 PM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
ok so i have to ask and if this too off topic just ignore it.  But (without giving away any trade secrets) how do you guys do high availability?  It's not like miningcore supports it.  If the master goes down with MC your toast.
Do you just have a bunch of ergo_nodes running behind a load balancer and one gigantic MC?


[09/06/2022 8:55 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
Hah. No trade secrets.  You can define multiple daemons in MC.  But I find that an internal load balancer is best. We always have one on same region as stratum and secondary in alternate closest region (eg east us vs west)


[09/06/2022 9:17 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
But the challenge is that MC knows if a node is out of sync. A load balancer doesn‚Äôt. It requires querying the api to know. Which you can if your load balancer has logic capability


[09/06/2022 9:28 PM] MGpai#4313
hmm, really? Was not aware of this


[09/06/2022 9:28 PM] MGpai#4313
thanks


[09/06/2022 9:30 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
You should look at using a different driver for i/o based activities. Again maybe its not a big issue once sync'ed, but those bumps in disk read/write are of concern.  But our findings is from a few months ago, maybe newest node versions dont have that much of an issue.


[09/06/2022 9:33 PM] MGpai#4313
I guess it should be fine for my synced node...


[09/06/2022 9:39 PM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
I understand exactly what you mean by  having multiple nodes and having the load balancer know whether the node is synced or not. ( kubernetes has a readiness probe, etc).
After digging around MC and MC's github, it seems that MC can have lots of "slaves", but only one 'master' MC instance and if that dude goes down.   Seems it's game over.  But once again I'm not running the scale you guys are.


[09/06/2022 10:41 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
From a globally distributed, you should be running relay clients and one relay master.  That relay master we have it running in docker, and if it dies another spins up.  All MCs are stateless except if relay clients are caching shares (which in case, goes to a local volume on the docker host).


[09/06/2022 10:42 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
if the master dies, and cant spin up in reasonable time to fetch the shares from relay clients, the clients will save the shares to local file system which you can then import into the shares table.


[09/06/2022 10:42 PM] AllCloudy | GetBlok.io#1273
so regardless - shares are safe. Which is what matters

its the only way to scale. otherwise multiple MC instances will step over eachother running statistics updates, and also clobber your db

What's a good way to calculate the total transaction fees for a given block? Or how to get the transaction fees for the non-wallet transactions in the block?


[09/08/2022 7:29 AM] Prohashing-Steven#6510
Looking on the explorer, it seems transaction fees get sent to a fee address  "2iHkR7CWvD1R4j1yZg5bkeDRQavjAaVPeTDFGGLZduHyfWMuYpmhHocX8GJoaieTx78FntzJbCBVL6rf96ocJoZdmWBL2fci7NqWgAirppPQmZ7fN9V6z13Ay6brPriBKYqLp1bT2Fk4FkFLCfdPpe" on mainnet? I didn't really see much documentation or info on this. One approach I thought of is sum up all the outputs going to this address (not sure if there's a more programmatic way of doing this)?

I tried doing GET /blocks/{headerId} which gives the boxId outputs for transactions in the block. However, I can't then do /wallet/transactionById because it's a non-wallet transaction. And /utxo/byId/{boxId} doesn't work, maybe because it's a non-wallet transaction? Say if I was the miner for the block, would it be considered an in-wallet transaction?


[09/08/2022 7:59 AM] abchris#8522
With a node, you can use `/blocks/{headerId}` to get all a blocks content - including transaction data. You can go through the block's transactions, on of which will spend all tx fees from the fee address to the block's miner.


[09/08/2022 8:01 AM] abchris#8522

The goal is to determine how much transaction fee rewards we obtained for each block we mine

[09/08/2022 10:03 AM] abchris#8522
They‚Äôre chained txs. Tx fees accumulated within a block get spent in the same block. There will always be a single tx spending from the fee address. That spending = block tx fees.

what does your config look like?  You might want to move to the solo-mining space, but happy to help.


[09/09/2022 12:41 AM] abchris#8522
You can get the diff from block headers, then divide by time it took to mine them. Better to smooth over some period. Eg sum diffs from all blocks mined in a 24h window and divide by 86400. That'll give you hashrate in H/s.

Where would I find that info?


[09/09/2022 1:37 AM] Prohashing-Steven#6510
I think I finally found the solution. 

I wasn't aware that `/script/addressToTree/{address}` can be used to convert an ergo address to ergoTree format, which is the format returned by `/blocks/{headerId}`.  I can check and sum up outputs sent to the feeAddress's ergoTree in `/blocks/{headerId}`.


[09/09/2022 1:37 AM] Prohashing-Steven#6510
It seems the feeAddress script on mainnet is "2iHkR7CWvD1R4j1yZg5bkeDRQavjAaVPeTDFGGLZduHyfWMuYpmhHocX8GJoaieTx78FntzJbCBVL6rf96ocJoZdmWBL2fci7NqWgAirppPQmZ7fN9V6z13Ay6brPriBKYqLp1bT2Fk4FkFLCfdPpe". Is this always the same, or can this ever change?

If it is constant, maybe I'll add a config / constant value in my program. If not, is there a way or api call to programmatically determine the feeAddress (and mining reward script)?

I initialized a new wallet on a node.
After mining, there is some amount on it.

I started another node and used the same seed phrase during wallet initialization.
Through this new node, I tried to send a transaction and got an error: There must be at least one input box.
I also noticed that now a different address is used on the new node.

How can I fix this? 
Should I use this method /wallet/updateChangeAddress and pass in body the address from the first node?
I tried to do this and I get this error: "The request content was malformed:\nexpected whitespace or eof got 'address...' (line 1, column 2)"

Thanks I do have that in my config file.  Unfortunately for me something happened to the database.  I kept getting a bad api key.  Now I'm resyncing the node.

@peachmufffin explain your problem here.  Someone will be able to help.  @AllCloudy | GetBlok.io @Cheese Enthusiast he has a node issue with his pool.  He restored his mnemonic on a second node and he‚Äôs getting an error  that one input box must be included also has a different address on the new node.  He‚Äôs trying to figure out how to fix it.

Here's our testnet bloknet config, sorry for taking long was out all day:

`scorex {
    restApi {
        # Hex-encoded Blake2b256 hash of an API key.
        # Should be 64-chars long Base16 string.
        # below is the hash of the string 'hello'

    },
    network {
        maxConnections = 100
        knownPeers = [ "<THIS IS ONE OF OUR NODES>:9026" ]
        peerDiscovery = true
        declaredAddress = "<YOUR IP>:9026"

        # NTP server address
        server = "pool.ntp.org"

        # update time rate

        timeout = 30s

A different mnemonic password results in different address, are they the same on both nodes?


[09/10/2022 4:06 AM] peachmufffin#8779
On init wallet form I pass same mnemoic phrase with empty mnemonic password on both nodes.
Or are you asking about something else? Then I did not understand your question.


[09/10/2022 8:42 AM] FlyingPig#2854
What determines how long a transactions stays in the mempool? (can I reduce it?


[09/10/2022 8:43 AM] FlyingPig#2854
Meaning, an invalid transaction that I submitted is stuck on my local node)


[09/10/2022 8:45 AM] FlyingPig#2854
Is there a "flush mempool" option? (I can restart the node, but that's not optimal)


[09/10/2022 10:15 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Thought mempool disregards invalid tx from internal checks? Is this not the case?


[09/10/2022 11:13 AM] FlyingPig#2854
Let me rephrase, it's valid but still stuck on my node (and not anyone else's).  I need to flush it out. I


[09/10/2022 11:14 AM] FlyingPig#2854
It's valid, but the same TX was mined by someone else. This is for ergodex/spectrum bots and I'm trying some things out.

Yeah that‚Äôs not up to date yet


[09/11/2022 7:10 PM] HelixEvo#2120
On explorer for your wallet the balance should be what you are expecting


[09/11/2022 7:18 PM] repoman1#7239
i thought it would have been up to date by now


[09/11/2022 7:18 PM] repoman1#7239

[09/11/2022 7:19 PM] repoman1#7239
for it to be up to date, just leave it the node running?


[09/11/2022 7:29 PM] repoman1#7239
its like the height doesn't want to progress at all


[09/11/2022 7:34 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Sounds a bit stuck. Runs on decent hardware I‚Äôm guessing? Maybe also set 4g in conf file to assign to jvm


[09/11/2022 7:41 PM] repoman1#7239
should have enough resources
8g ram
2 cores


[09/11/2022 7:41 PM] repoman1#7239
what are the parameters in the conf file i should add?


[09/11/2022 7:43 PM] repoman1#7239
i launch the node with this


[09/11/2022 7:43 PM] repoman1#7239
java -jar -Xmx4G ergo-*.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf


[09/11/2022 7:48 PM] repoman1#7239
when building the node, I had some issues that after like 20min of the command running it would get stuck and had to manually reload it


[09/11/2022 7:48 PM] repoman1#7239
other than that i did see at some point the green sync state


[09/11/2022 8:09 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Thats it


[09/11/2022 8:09 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Build from scratch or use files from another sync? It synced now?


[09/11/2022 8:10 PM] HelixEvo#2120
But basically, if you have 100% block sync and wallet has synced. Then you will see your balance properly


[09/11/2022 8:11 PM] repoman1#7239
nop


[09/11/2022 8:11 PM] repoman1#7239
but i believe the culprit is my firewall


[09/11/2022 8:11 PM] repoman1#7239
i saw some deny logs to the port being used by the node


[09/11/2022 8:12 PM] repoman1#7239
see many of these though in the console of the node


[09/11/2022 8:12 PM] repoman1#7239
Failed to connect to : /85.114.162.120:9030


[09/11/2022 8:13 PM] repoman1#7239
even peers being removed from peers database


[09/11/2022 8:16 PM] repoman1#7239
kinda odd cuz no changes were made on firewall since it reached the green state in sync state a few days ago


[09/11/2022 8:20 PM] repoman1#7239
kinda odd
i see it gets new peers lists, tries them but than removes them from peer list


[09/11/2022 8:22 PM] repoman1#7239
fuck it ill rebuilt the VM

@kushti how much potch to re-launch from your node testnet with better timings?

You don't need to run your own node, just use the links


[09/14/2022 10:58 AM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
and why that


[09/14/2022 11:03 AM] MGpai#4313
Because testnet is down?


[09/14/2022 11:12 AM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
u don't get what I mean. I run a node in testnet because I test all my conf in testnet. so the only thing that changes between testnet and mainnet in my deployment files is the docker image and the ports. this way I am almost certain that when I deploy something in production, my deployment will not go through some weird error that I wouldn't have catch in test if I don't have the exact same conf. Now u tell me that I don't have to run my conf in testnet. But for me this is not an option.


[09/14/2022 11:19 AM] ziggomatic#9335
the testnets are currently fractured. there is: official testnet, getblok testnet, and i guess now also paiNet? ihni. the official one is stuck 'cause block time was reduced too aggressively, hence other devs spinning up their own. i don't know much more beyond that

has anyone else experienced the full node wallet not accurately reflecting the wallet address balance as verified by the block explorer?

Ran into this yesterday. Wound up downloading Nautilus and recovering the wallet over there just to be able to check against other UIs. The $ERG is there so its gotta be something with the sync state.

Full node wallet showed the node in a constant state of active synchronization. Could that be contributing?

hey guys, i successfully synced my mainnet node the other day and have used it with no errors. i sent my local node wallet (mainnet) 0.15 ERG just to play around with.
I have now synced a testnet node however the testnet wallet was already initialised as all i needed to do was enter a spending password (same as my mainnet phrase). The testnet wallet has a balance of 0.15 ERG.
Im just very confused lol, ive ran /info and can see my current node is running testnet...
How and why is the testnet wallet showing my mainnet balance? Have i done something wrong or is it just a bug in the wallet panel?
Cheers guys

how many slots are available until node returns the "pool full" error?
and nother question, there might be a bug in the double spent error message node returns - I got the error for a box that had a double spent attempt, but the former transaction was invalidated and removed from the pool. yet I was not able to submit a new transaction.
@pragmaxim is that something for you, could you check if there is an issue?


[09/24/2022 9:25 PM] pragmaxim#0778
"pool full" error is thrown when `ergo.node.mempoolCapacity` is reached, ie. it literally contains that many transactions that queued up


[09/24/2022 9:26 PM] pragmaxim#0778
as a consequence of no new block being applied by this node ... that may happen most likely due to many transactions being broadcasted from other peers or submitted to this node and no block mined in reasonable time which would empty the pool


[09/24/2022 9:57 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yep. to the other problem, I am sure there is an issue. the invalidated transaction still blocks attempts to spend its box again


[09/24/2022 9:58 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I guess this will somehow resetted when a new block is found, but since this takes ages right now the issue comes up


[09/24/2022 10:03 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
okay, I have to correct myself now that a block is found: despite not being shown in mempool, the transaction was mined. this is the behaviour reported by flux folks


[09/24/2022 10:34 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
could it be that this is caused by mempools being full and therefore not synced through the network? the default setting of 50 tx in mempool might be too small


[09/24/2022 10:40 PM] pragmaxim#0778
maybe it used to be possible to outrun TXs when pool is full if it pays more https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/blob/3ef580f00266ba99863712e7cea3482bd02d71ea/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/nodeView/mempool/ErgoMemPool.scala#L176


[09/24/2022 10:41 PM] pragmaxim#0778
but currently this conditions https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/blob/3ef580f00266ba99863712e7cea3482bd02d71ea/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/nodeView/mempool/ErgoMemPool.scala#L200 imho drops all TXs if pool is full (or the tx was invalidated or is already present)


[09/24/2022 10:41 PM] pragmaxim#0778
it does not go further to the point where it could overrun them


[09/24/2022 10:43 PM] pragmaxim#0778
where do you see `mempoolCapacity = 50`  ?


[09/24/2022 10:46 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Did not see it, but most nodes I fetched mempool from have 50 transactions waiting.
But maybe my bad, should have set a higher limit for the API


[09/24/2022 10:54 PM] pragmaxim#0778
mm, the TX is rejected in 3 cases, pool is full, the TX is already present in the pool (by `id`) or it was invalidated before (besides validation of what it does but that is imo unrelated)


[09/24/2022 10:58 PM] pragmaxim#0778
otherwise I can't see anything suspicious, there is one problem with an invalid TX being present in a block where it was not invalidated in mempool and delivery tracker, which I attempted to fix here https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/pull/1803


[09/24/2022 11:48 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
since it was mined later, I guess it was not invalidated but not propagated to all nodes because of the full pool. which is the default pool size btw?


[09/25/2022 2:53 AM] NoahErgo#4349
Hi guys.

When miners are proposing governance changes within the node, how do they designate what they want to change a value to? I see that you can define parameter ID and also whether you want increase or decrease, but not so clear how you say how much to increase or decrease by


[09/25/2022 6:15 AM] Kaotic#4193
Any reason not to run a node in proxmox? Im thinking of adding a minimal debian box for an ergo node.


[09/25/2022 6:19 AM] Kaotic#4193
Also how much memory would I need to allocate for the node itself?


[09/25/2022 7:38 AM] pragmaxim#0778
I cannot find an evidence that this would be overriden https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.conf#L62 
I'd check the node like this http://localhost:9053/transactions/unconfirmed?offset=0&sortBy=size&sortDirection=desc


[09/25/2022 9:51 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
you are right, 1,000 is a lot and shouldn't get reached. however, the situation was like that pretty long (due to the long block times), my transaction stayed in the ergo.watch node I used to submit it but never showed up on explorer or other nodes I connected to. maybe keep it in mind, others reported some similar issues so there is something not working quite right with the sync probably


[09/25/2022 10:46 AM] pragmaxim#0778
@MrStahlfelge and how many unconfirmed TXs did you get from the API ? Is ergo.watch rest api accessible ?


[09/25/2022 10:50 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yes it is accessible, it was showing the transaction waiting


[09/25/2022 10:51 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
usually we had 30-50 transactions waiting during my tests, but maybe I should have given a higher limit to see more


[09/25/2022 11:54 AM] Pulsarz#9208
Indeed, had the same thing yesterday. Then all txes came in explorer after a new block (still unconfirmed) with same time.


[09/25/2022 11:54 AM] Pulsarz#9208
So it was somewhere queued


[09/25/2022 4:11 PM] pragmaxim#0778
this looks a lot like the Node behind explorer was not responsive


[09/25/2022 7:24 PM] abchris#8522

[09/25/2022 8:40 PM] NoahErgo#4349
@glasgowm do you know where this info originated from? where the rest of info for parameter steps might be?


[09/25/2022 9:45 PM] abchris#8522
That table comes from the yellow paper.
Parameters without an explicit step have a step of 1 or 1% of current value, whatever is higher. <https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/blob/272277bd93f2ac230ab7620bea752b4f26be13fc/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/settings/Parameters.scala#L153>

[09/26/2022 12:34 PM] ‚≠êFanta‚≠ê#0315
thats almost done, but the order of the transaction and box ids in addresses is not the same as the explorer


[09/26/2022 12:35 PM] ‚≠êFanta‚≠ê#0315
the explorer seems the order txs by their id, not their number

Hey guys, I'm in need of help. My synchronization state is "Active synchronization," but the altitude has been at the same value for several days. Can anyone help me troubleshoot or point me in the right direction? In PowerShell: WARN  [tor.default-dispatcher-12] o.e.n.ErgoNodeViewSynchronizer - Chain is stuck! Node already stuck when started

any other known open peers on paiNet/testnet besides 195.201.82.115:9021 and 213.239.193.208:9022?


[10/10/2022 8:34 AM] Balvand#0653
i only have those 2 peers and i think it's causing some funkiness


[10/10/2022 6:47 PM] HelixEvo#2120
They should be same ports I would guess


[10/10/2022 7:42 PM] Balvand#0653
yeah, i'm using the official peers in the provided config on Github (https://github.com/mgpai22/paiNet) 
not really sure where those 2 peers came from, but they're the only ones connected to my peer

[10/14/2022 10:38 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
the estimated fee result APIs give very weird results at the moment. could be since the hard fork. 
default wallet app node reports a wait time of 1,000,000,000 minutes right now http://159.65.11.55:9053/transactions/waitTime?txSize=1000&fee=1000000
can you take a look at it@pragmaxim


[10/14/2022 10:51 AM] pragmaxim#0778
and since when do you think this is happening ?


[10/14/2022 10:52 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
my feeling is it is happening since the hard fork


[10/14/2022 10:52 AM] pragmaxim#0778
the stats are being collected based on Txs added/removed from pool ... the dynamics obviously changed and to me it seems like a consequence of `remove` not being called https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/blob/1b41bdaf79a6ccbe0b5add5b2c371e11b8ac4455/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/nodeView/ErgoNodeViewHolder.scala#L624


[10/14/2022 10:53 AM] pragmaxim#0778
so the Stats collector sort of thinks the Txs are hanging there for a long time ... @kushti isn't it strange that the `mempool.remove` method is now called from this place ONLY ?


[10/14/2022 10:53 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
ah okay. don't know about the internals but problem is since 10-14 days now and that's why I thought about the hf


[10/14/2022 11:03 AM] pragmaxim#0778
I wasn't involved much in the work around this, so to find the needle in this haystack is not easy ... @kushti imho this might be a regression from https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/pull/1819/files


[10/14/2022 11:13 AM] kushti#0978
@MrStahlfelge what was previous version and api result?


[10/14/2022 11:14 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
usually it returns 0, even when we had 1 hour block times.


[10/14/2022 11:22 AM] pragmaxim#0778
@kushti this statement confuses the stats collector `mp.remove(utx).putWithoutCheck(utx)` + we don't call `mp.remove` method anywhere else anymore


[10/14/2022 3:41 PM] MGpai#4313
I know it was always a bit weird even before the fork

hello, what would be a good reason to configure a second node pointing to miningcore?


[10/18/2022 10:25 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
For backup.  If one node happens to go out of sync or service, the second one would ensure your pool continutes.


[10/18/2022 10:26 PM] DreamsMoney#1427
Is there any solution for the node thinking it's synced at the incorrect height?

but that wont help on big attacks


[11/24/2022 8:54 PM] essaias#5787
they are usually filtered on network level.


[11/24/2022 8:55 PM] essaias#5787
I operate my nodes on VPS servers that have ddos mitigiation on network level by the provider


[11/24/2022 8:56 PM] essaias#5787
this kills the traffic before it even reaches the vps / proxy


[11/24/2022 8:56 PM] MGpai#4313
oh thats nice


[11/24/2022 8:57 PM] essaias#5787
but that rate limiter will help for most attacks your private nodes will see

if you do not use nginx but apache to proxy the node api I think it also has some rate limiter


[11/24/2022 9:02 PM] MGpai#4313
I use trafik


[11/24/2022 9:02 PM] MGpai#4313
with docker


[11/24/2022 9:03 PM] essaias#5787
ok, i know it but dont know if it has such a limiter... would need some research

i'm trying to setup a node on my MacBook but the "run.command" file doesn't do anything when double clicked and so i start it from the "Satergo" icon in the bin file. It does start a wallet, then syncs the headers to 15.55% and it gets stuck there forever


[12/05/2022 6:39 AM] Cor#5422
any assistance to setup my node would be appreciated


[12/05/2022 9:33 PM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
So how bad is this in my node output.  I'm mining to this node and it's fully synced.  ( version 5.0.3)

[12/06/2022 3:03 AM] MGpai#4313
are you mining on testnet or mainnet?


[12/06/2022 3:03 AM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
mainnet


[12/06/2022 3:04 AM] MGpai#4313
hmmm


[12/06/2022 3:04 AM] MGpai#4313
Is your wallet unlocked and everything?


[12/06/2022 3:04 AM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
i've got production running  and for 3 days have had 16GH on it, just added another 4...


[12/06/2022 3:05 AM] MGpai#4313
@Cheese Enthusiast knows about mainnet mining


[12/06/2022 3:05 AM] MGpai#4313
@Reqlez can you check logs?


[12/06/2022 3:06 AM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
i'm running miningcore ( and in the past) I've put the clear password to the wallet and  node...


[12/06/2022 3:06 AM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
i also see this in the logs

even though it may be empty you still need to unlock

oh of course,


[12/06/2022 3:09 AM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
i have the api key unlocked  and the wallet unlocked.  I've run the same 'setup' in the past, but  now bringing ergo to a wider distribution instead of a closed beta from a few months ago


[12/06/2022 3:10 AM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
I've tried both v5.03 and v4.0.105


[12/06/2022 3:11 AM] MGpai#4313
yeah sorry unfortunately I don't know much about mainnet mining


[12/06/2022 3:13 AM] Reqlez#6611
"Trying to update prover's parameters, but prover is not initialized" don't u usually see that when the wallet is locked?  I wonder if the DB is corrupt or something üëÄ   ill check my logs in a bit, but i dont have a mining node on mainnet


[12/06/2022 3:14 AM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
That is the only thing i see in the log that is super unusual...


[12/06/2022 3:15 AM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
i did comment this out recently and the log messages have calmed down
```
actor.mailbox.requirements {
    "akka.dispatch.BoundedMessageQueueSemantics" = bounded-mailbox
  }

```


[12/06/2022 3:20 AM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
i am still seeing
```
 o.e.n.wallet.WalletVars - Trying to update prover's parameters, but prover is not initialized
``` 
in both v4 and v5 of the node.


[12/06/2022 3:24 AM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
I've verified through swagger api that running unlock with the wallet password does in fact work


[12/06/2022 3:26 AM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
@lgd  - do you have any contacts that can help with production node issues?

i've gotten that error message you are getting before but i have forgotten what causes it


[12/06/2022 7:48 AM] essaias#5787
is there any command to make a full node rescan and resync if its stuck?


[12/06/2022 7:48 AM] essaias#5787
deleting the chain and resyncing is somehow fast compared to other chains but yet not that effective


[12/06/2022 7:43 PM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
with the new v5.0.4 image and removing from the config  this:
```
actor.mailbox.requirements {
    "akka.dispatch.BoundedMessageQueueSemantics" = bounded-mailbox
  }
```

However the block that i hit before the fork won't confirm


[12/06/2022 8:59 PM] lgd#5847
tbh im the wrong guy to ask for this kind of stuff, i don't have my own node running 24/7 yet. i also don't mine yet since i lack the hardware.


[12/06/2022 9:11 PM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
Honestly, i just want to find out how i can get some support from the ergo 'team'.  Literally i'm not trying to do rocket science.

Existence of dead letters does not necessarily indicate a problem.

For miningcore there is this if you haven't seen it, but not clear what your issue is.

Probably best opening a comprehensive topic in #dev-forum with details as it'll get buried here. (Or #üõ†‚îÇhost-a-pool )

GetBlok have a repo that is a few dozen commits ahead with 'as-is' support. Not sure of anyone else who will know off-hand or uses miningcore. (excluding mhs_sam who made the stratum server after autolykos v2)

@MGpai  now i understand why u wanted the node, i have most endpoints exposed here: https://ergo-node-api.anetabtc.io/blocks/   as example.  ( nothing related to wallet, or node info tho )


[12/07/2022 12:05 AM] MGpai#4313
Awesome!


[12/07/2022 7:22 AM] essaias#5787
If you delete it manually and resync from the chain it currently takes like 20h to get up and working again. 
Rewinding to a known good local block and starting to sync from that again would speed things up in my mind.

Background: 
Yesterday (and today again üòñ) docker filled the disk of one of my vps and the node failed to write its data to disk. 
It seems it does not even notice that (and stop) and also cannot recover from that.

Have a block reward question. I had an old node (4.x) that had a wallet and I had a private mining stratum pool pointing at it. I upgraded it a couple days ago to 5.0.3 and I appear to have a popped a block last night. What is weird is the reward address in my mining config is set to my old address; but the block appears to have gone to a different address; and I have a new xxxx.json file in my keystore directory... any ideas?


[12/13/2022 5:40 PM] Donalddd#2998
Has anyone tried to deploy the node on Kubernetes?


[12/14/2022 12:55 PM] Kenial#1852
Hello, how exactly can I make sure my node is reachable, and what do I have to do to make sure my ports, etc. are configured properly? For context I'm running a node off a docker in unRAID and want to make sure that I'm properly contributing to the network. Thanks


[12/14/2022 7:39 PM] rustinmyeye#3722
Im not very technical, so I‚Äôm not sure what the correct answer is, but here‚Äôs what I do‚Ä¶ I change the node url to my own in Ergo Wallet App and make sure I can make transactions from cellular, and I also search ergonodes.net for my ip. On ergonodes you can see if your node is reachable or not.


[12/16/2022 4:30 AM] Kenial#1852
Thanks!


[12/16/2022 4:58 AM] MGpai#4313
if you want your node to be reachable outside your network you must port forward 9053 in your router settings


[12/16/2022 4:58 AM] MGpai#4313
you can use it just fine if you are connected to the same network the node is connected to


[12/16/2022 7:43 AM] Donalddd#2998
Is it safe to expose a node on the external network?


[12/16/2022 11:19 AM] MGpai#4313
should be fine as long as you have a strong wallet password and api key


[12/18/2022 2:00 PM] Hara'peko Suiren#3847
Is it possible that a node tells me that I mined blocks and that I have these rewards mined on my wallet balance but it is actually not?


[12/19/2022 10:00 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Its port 9030 is it not? 9053 is if you want to expose it for API calls etc? P2P external access is port 9030?


[12/19/2022 10:04 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Only port you want to forward initially is 9030 for the P2P layer. You will know if this is then external via site already mentioned or the amount of peers connected to you. If > than 30 tends to suggest its accepting connections inbound as well as just outbound. If you are looking to host API calls etc, then you also then have to forward port 9053. Preferably on SSL.


[12/19/2022 10:05 AM] HelixEvo#2120
If wanting to supply the API call options, then also edit your .conf file to advertise your API link.


[12/23/2022 2:43 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Is there a header or some value that can be referenced that just gives a true or false answer as to whether the header height and current block height of node is matching? Basically to see if its synced or not?


[01/03/2023 6:58 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
Hello , just now completed the installation / procedure to make Ergo Node , currently syncing blocks ,  but i have couple of question please : 1- into my hive flightsheet , i should add my <node ip>:9053 , is the port 9053 is the correct one ?  my second question is :  is it possible to use Zelcore wallet address once i do mining instead of swagger UI created wallet address ?  my last question what is the suitable hashrate you think it is worth to do solo mining with Ergo node , example 5 G/hash is good ?
Thanks in advance for your valuable info
appreciate your help


[01/03/2023 7:16 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Hiya... You are in the same boat as me. Going to use my node as solo mine. I think however we will need a stratum type service also on the node.


[01/03/2023 7:18 PM] R 3 B üö¨ .#9458
mmmm i didnt see anything talking about the stratum , you mean like a bridge ?


[01/03/2023 7:19 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Yes. I could be off on this, but I don't think its just setting MINING=TRUE and thats it.

You can still use a zelcore wallet address as long as its an ergo address.

Probably because you are trying something quite rare. most use some pool - even to solo mine.

[01/14/2023 5:33 AM] matty_19#4994
Though probably not the issue. Are you trying to mine to it?


[01/14/2023 5:36 AM] Repampanoz#4088
Wallet is unlocked, I am trying to mine to my addy
But that addy is an existing one, I used restore wallet and that was probably my issue
For a moment, it got fully synced and the funds of my wallet where not there (they show up in my actual wallet) plus the address is different than my wallet address


[01/14/2023 5:36 AM] Repampanoz#4088
I probably messed up by doing that, thinking on doing a full wipe and create a new wallet. Can't find anything on how to unlink wallet from actual node

I think you should be able to mine to an existing wallet but not 100% sure. Mining doesn't look like its enabled from your pic though. ergo.conf file should look something like:

ergo {
    directory = "C:/Users/owner/Documents/Miners/Ergo_Node"
      networkType = "mainnet"
      node {
       mining = true
    }

    chain {
     reemission {
      checkReemissionRules = true
     }
     }

    wallet{
      checkEIP27 = true
      secretStorage.secretDir = "C:/Users/owner/Documents/Miners/Ergo_Node/wallet/keystore"
     }
    }

scorex {
  restApi {
        ## Hex-encoded Blake2b256 hash of an API key. 
        ## Should be 64-chars long Base16 string.
        ## below is the hash of the string 'hello'
        ## replace with your actual hash 
        apiKeyHash = "YourApiKeyHere"
     
      }
    }

@Repampanoz assuming you have followed the node setup instructions, correct javascript version etc.

Hello there, did anyone already ask about stuck sync? Sorry if my question is repeated. It started 2 days ago. My node was synced, but current height didn‚Äôt change. I tried to update to version 5.0.6 from 5.0.4 - no changes, i removed all data from ergo folder and reinstalled the node - it stucked on some block from 2021. So then i changed client to version 5.0.5 and reinstalled the node again. This is current screen of my node

My node does not even appear as `unreachable` lol Can anyone tell me what i am doing wrong so far? Also, is it possible to use a domain name inside `declaredAddress = ""` instead of an IP?

[01/23/2023 6:11 AM] Reqlez#6611
As far as i know, you need to provide the declared address. Looking at that Class that is being used it seems you can indeed use a hostname? I have not tried personally: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/InetSocketAddress.html


[01/23/2023 6:12 AM] Reqlez#6611
"InetSocketAddress(String¬†hostname, int¬†port)" one of the constructors has a string here. so i think will work?

So indeed filling `declaredAddress = ""` does the trick, huge improvement, my node is now listed as `unreachable`. Though that function translated the domain i filled it with into an IP which is sadly the internal IP of the server in my local network, which is kinda sad since using the `domain + port` from the outside allows my node to be reachable.

[01/24/2023 4:49 AM] Reqlez#6611
oh man, that thing actually translates it to IP right on the local node  üòÖ   okay, what if you add an entry into your hosts file, that translates DNS to your external ip ?  I think that "may" work?


[01/24/2023 4:51 AM] Reqlez#6611
I think that declaredAddress needs some re-work. Especially to allow IPv6 and future Tor domains.   I was going to write a post about how to implement TOR, too... but I have been getting sidetracked. I will get back into that research soon üòÖ


[01/24/2023 4:53 AM] blackmennewstyle#8333
My external IP is not fixed, it changes from time to times. Using the domain would have be the best case scenario since i use `no-ip` services and it updates my IP on that domain every single time it changes.


[01/24/2023 4:53 AM] Reqlez#6611
that means u will have to write a script that put the new external IP in your hosts file and update it LOL  yes... not very ideal at all...


[01/24/2023 4:55 AM] Reqlez#6611
Again, i think declaredAddress needs some re-work.  I think FQDNs should be allowed to be advertised, imo. But this is not how it works right now, sorry.


[01/24/2023 4:57 AM] blackmennewstyle#8333

[01/31/2023 2:18 PM] Luivatra#9076
yes, blocks are getting more complex with higher blockchain usage


[01/31/2023 4:04 PM] Repampanoz#4088
Makes sense


[01/31/2023 4:06 PM] Repampanoz#4088
Also as time per synced block increases and there's new blocks added every 2 minutes, time increases even more lol

I'll make a snapshot once I'm on the current block level

Hello, 
testing the new indexes with node 5.0.7, I'm facing an issue to get the balance of a specific address: 9hfmJjrmeyhNgQZks1NzvrJyNgtHuMinnZbrupk6gGxTZWQQf87
    curl -X POST "http://213.239.193.208:9053/blockchain/balance" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "9hfmJjrmeyhNgQZks1NzvrJyNgtHuMinnZbrupk6gGxTZWQQf87"
returns:
{
  "error" : 500,
  "reason" : "internal.error",
  "detail" : "None.get"
}
Looking for the balance of that adddress on explorer, it is working:
https://api.ergoplatform.com/api/v1/addresses/9hfmJjrmeyhNgQZks1NzvrJyNgtHuMinnZbrupk6gGxTZWQQf87/balance/total

The same command is working for all other addresses for example:
    curl -X POST "http://213.239.193.208:9053/blockchain/balance" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "9g16ZMPo22b3qaRL7HezyQt2HSW2ZBF6YR3WW9cYQjgQwYKxxoT"

The issue is also visible for the same address on my node.

There are some limitations on the balance index that skip some addresses ?

is this the cause for internal error?


[02/28/2023 6:56 PM] ‚≠êFanta‚≠ê#0315
Since it causes blocks to be skipped, therefore transactions and boxes will be skipped aswell.

Which is bad


[02/28/2023 6:58 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042

Hello @kushti @error @Reqlez, dear nodes providers, 
I've just released SAFEW 0.7.0 that uses only the node to fetch the blockchain information.
The performance seems really good to me when the ping is low with the node.
The transaction list page, and more the transaction CSV export for large volume causes some high CPU consumption on the used node.
I've tried to limit it a bit, but let me know if this triggers some issues for you.

it seems there is a bug with the blockchain/balance endpoint. If I have spectrum LP tokens the endpoint errors out with a 500 error

{
  "error" : 500,
  "reason" : "internal.error",
  "detail" : "None.get"
}

I tried to tail the node's log file, but could not identify the 500 error in there.

Removing and readding the tokens leads to the same result each time. Without those LP tokens the endpoint delivers the correct amount of erg and non-LP tokens, otherwise the 500 error.

Understandable, it's not the wallet with the issue (also happens with a normal curl request to the node), just wanted to let you know. I think it's something maybe @‚≠êFanta‚≠ê can look at, when times allows it. Btw I had rebuilt the index from scratch after upgrading to 5.0.8.

@kushti curious about this as well


[04/30/2023 1:51 AM] FlyingPig#2854
Nothing?


I'm not a dev but I can read and understand some of it....so i dug into the code (almost got lost and didn't get back up!)

` val blacklistedTransactions = nodeSettings.blacklistedTransactions
    if (blacklistedTransactions.nonEmpty && **blacklistedTransactions.contains(tx.id)**) {
      val exc = new Exception(**"blacklisted tx")**
      this.invalidate(unconfirmedTx) -> new ProcessingOutcome.Invalidated(exc, validationStartTime)
    } else {
      val fee = extractFee(tx)
      val minFee = settings.nodeSettings.minimalFeeAmount
      val canAccept = pool.canAccept(unconfirmedTx)`

This seems like an ability to blacklist based on transaction id.

I don't get it, txids are random, what's the purpose of a blacklisting option.
Furthermore, we shouldn't blackilist anything really??

Probably kept around in case of any similar issues in the future

that makes sense. There were indeed some TXes that would get stuck in the past. I managed to generate a TX like that, that got stuck in everybody's mempools on mainnet üòÖ

Hello @‚≠êFanta‚≠ê  , several nodes indexers seem stuck on height "indexedHeight": 993100
{
  "indexedHeight" : 993100,
  "fullHeight" : 993466
}
Affected:
http://213.239.193.208:9053/blockchain/indexedHeight (5.0.8-12-5d2fabe8-SNAPSHOT)
https://ergonode-api.ergohost.io/blockchain/indexedHeight (5.0.9-0-5d2fabe8-20230419-1019-SNAPSHOT)
http://51.77.221.96:9053/blockchain/indexedHeight (5.0.9)

Working:
https://ergo-node.zoomout.io/blockchain/indexedHeight (5.0.9)

Maybe you could have a look at the issue ?
Should the index be dropped and recomputed to unlock ?

Hello guys, I am preparing to set up a home node. I have a dedicated VM at home for that and recently I have set up a test node to see if everything works fine, it seems to work fine indeed. But I have some questions:

1. First of all, I care a lot about my home security. When I follow the guide to run the mainnet docker image, are any ports of my system exposed online, or my router blocks all incoming traffic? I would like to be as secure as possible, but I can't understand if the nodeport opens the "vm" port to my local network, or the nodeport opens the port to the internet.

2. When updating node versions, it seems that I have to stop the docker image from running, and launching again. Does this mean that I have to go again to the initialization process, sychronize everything, set up my API password and import my wallet again?

my configuration is: I have one LAN and the VM has an IP from the same subnet as the rest of my devices


[04/30/2023 12:46 PM] Donalddd#2998
I don't have any dedicated networking setup, just a router and a server attached to it.


[04/30/2023 2:27 PM] error#5683
ergo-node.zoomout.io is working because indexedHeight is monitored and I reindexed after it went down


[04/30/2023 2:29 PM] error#5683
It would be great if there was another option than reindexing everything, maybe restart from a specific height if possible.

^ The only smart node operator around here üòå   i'm rebuilding mine too.


[04/30/2023 9:51 PM] ‚≠êFanta‚≠ê#0315
Uh oh, it seems like the rollback sometimes tries to update an already deleted address and crashing the indexer by doing so.


[04/30/2023 9:51 PM] ‚≠êFanta‚≠ê#0315
Should be fixed in 5.0.10

My own node does not have extraIndex enabled, because Im waiting until there are no more bugs...


[04/30/2023 9:55 PM] Pulsarz#9208
Hey, I look at it from the positive side, extraIndex is a blessing. I'd take the few bugs that might still popup over using explorer any day.
