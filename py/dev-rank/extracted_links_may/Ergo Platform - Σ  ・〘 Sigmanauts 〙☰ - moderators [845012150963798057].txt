@Ergonaut_Alpha I'll add the others here too but not sure their usernames. A comment automatically posts telling people to read the daily discussion, faq, and make sure their post doesn't belong in r/ergotrading or r/erg_miners


[05/20/2021 8:23 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
Like a PM that they receive when they follow the sub? Basically posting guidelines


[05/20/2021 9:01 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
Welcome message set . New adds will now receive a message asking them to 1) direct questions to the DD and FAQ section 2) direct mining posts to r/erg_miners 3) direct trading/buying posts to r/Ergotraders


[05/20/2021 9:29 PM] glasgowm#9381
I meant as a reply to the thread but that's an even better idea - thanks!


[05/21/2021 2:38 AM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
Ive set up the automod to remove any posts with mining or ELI5 in the title and gave it prompts to comment . I looked at the mod log and it was working already. Just need to get the timing right on the DD. I changed it to UTC +1

[05/21/2021 10:06 AM] glasgowm#9381
could you make the automod post the comment while the thread is still in the mod queue ?


[05/21/2021 10:06 AM] glasgowm#9381
cause this got removed, only noticed as I checked the mod log

[05/21/2021 12:57 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
I‚Äôll check it out and figure out why that happened today


[05/21/2021 2:24 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
The post was removed because I have flagged ‚ÄúELI5‚Äù in the tittle section in attempt to redirect questions to the DD and the FAQ section. Would we like to keep that action , remove , or edit? I‚Äôve let the user know what happened


[05/21/2021 4:00 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
Ok automod is completely set to post the DD automatically at 0:00 UTC . The template is located in Mod Tools‚Äî> scheduled posts ‚Äî> reoccurring posts


[05/21/2021 4:00 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
Comments will be sorted by *new*


[05/21/2021 5:02 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
I‚Äôll add a link into the DD for u/dejfson sigmaUSD ELI5 post . @glasgowm do you want me to add back in the dated news information going back a couple days now that I have it figured out?


[05/21/2021 5:32 PM] glasgowm#9381
eh the action itself is fine, but stuff will end up getting missed if it is removed from modqueue too


[05/21/2021 5:33 PM] glasgowm#9381
yeh whatever you think. How did you figure out the news?


[05/21/2021 6:06 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
Sorry misunderstanding I think. I had removed the section of your DD template that had the individual dates with the linked posts almost like a ‚Äúpast featured‚Äù because initially I was writing this all on the wiki page in CSS but come to find out they have recently just integrated a template for reoccurring scheduled posts . So good experience for me. Bad time management üòÜ


[05/25/2021 10:45 AM] glasgowm#9381
All seems to be running pretty smoothly, thanks üôÇ


[05/25/2021 10:46 AM] glasgowm#9381
I'm wondering if we can grab the top 5 posts in the past 24hrs and put them in the daily discussion? kinda auto-generating news


[05/25/2021 11:05 AM] glasgowm#9381
Can we add /r/ErgoNFTs to the autopost


[05/26/2021 1:17 AM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
I‚Äôll see what I can find on that


[05/26/2021 1:17 AM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
Yes


[05/27/2021 4:37 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
Updated the automatic DD post. Haven‚Äôt got a chance to look into automating the top post feature on it yet but I will ASAP

Did you turn the automod message off on new posts @Ergonaut_Alpha ?


[05/30/2021 3:31 AM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
@glasgowm no I didn‚Äôt do anything


[06/01/2021 3:55 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
I looked into the automod . Seems like since we have got things running Reddit has been changing the UI for controlling the automod features . Everything seems to be on the up and up . I added another filter for any post with question in the title to be removed and redirected . If they the anything in particular it‚Äôs doing that it shouldn‚Äôt be I‚Äôd be happy to look into it


[06/01/2021 4:01 PM] glasgowm#9381
nice one cheers, what do you mean by `Everything seems to be on the up and up` ?


[07/02/2021 10:30 AM] glasgowm#9381
@Ergonaut_Alpha could you change it to weekly for now - thinking we link to the FAQ in that too so we have 1 free pinned slot to use

I‚Äôm not sure why but it seems like every post and comment is requiring approval in the modque . I tried to look around the community settings to adjust it so that we don‚Äôt get a massive backlog of things to approval but it‚Äôs unclear if it‚Äôs been fixed


[07/02/2021 5:40 PM] glasgowm#9381
yeh I changed it to that as we were getting like 30 posts a day and the page was just spam. Can probably be disabled for now


[07/02/2021 5:40 PM] glasgowm#9381
unless we go up...


[07/02/2021 5:40 PM] glasgowm#9381
not comments though, just posts


[07/02/2021 5:41 PM] glasgowm#9381
comments that appear there are normally people that have either been shadow banned or removed by reddit's filters


[07/02/2021 6:00 PM] glasgowm#9381
i cant find the setting either now tho :/

[07/25/2021 9:43 AM] glasgowm#9381
should the weekly not be reposted by now @Ergonaut_Alpha

Begin by creating a new personal token on your GitHub Account here;
<https://github.com/settings/tokens>

If you do not trust this to your own account, its recommended you make a new GitHub account to act for the bot.
No additional permissions are required for public repositories, if you want to fetch from private repositories, you require full "repo" permissions.

Copy your newly created token and go to your DMs with the bot, and run the following command.
``[p]set api github token [YOUR NEW TOKEN]``

Finally reload the cog with ``[p]reload githubcards`` and you're set to add in new prefixes.

!!cc add oracles

There's a first generation hosted here https://nut.link/ by mmahut that uses metadata to get it on cardano. Article here https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-11-09-first-steps-towards-interoperability-with-cardano-oracles/

To work natively and utilise all the benefits of oracle pools ideally IOHK needs to add data-inputs to ADA as described here https://cardanoupdates.com/docs/255f71e1-458d-47e2-8504-3f25c729b44e by Robert K which seems like it would make DeFi in general a lot more practical on Cardano. Lots of startups trying to solve this problem atm - not sure what the current most likely is - and cardano itself is probably just focusing on getting alonso out.

!!cc edit oracles

See #oracle-pools 

There's a first generation hosted here https://nut.link/ by mmahut that uses metadata to get it on cardano. Article here https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-11-09-first-steps-towards-interoperability-with-cardano-oracles/

To work natively and utilise all the benefits of oracle pools ideally IOHK needs to add data-inputs to ADA as described here https://cardanoupdates.com/docs/255f71e1-458d-47e2-8504-3f25c729b44e by Robert K which seems like it would make DeFi in general a lot more practical on Cardano. Lots of startups trying to solve this problem atm - not sure what the current most likely is - and cardano itself is probably just focusing on getting alonso out.

!!cc add staking

Ergo is a Proof of Work blockchain, rather than Proof of Stake. However there is a staking solution being worked using the tokenisation of dApps that is almost complete. 

The first implementation of this will be on #ergomixer - more details available here

Be handy if they went to the mod-queue instead of straight removal


[12/29/2021 3:40 PM] glasgowm#9381
so seems that person was `justinbro430` - I've downvoted him more than he has comments in the subreddit so I'm guessing he deleted some.


[12/30/2021 6:38 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
ya probably is him. I saw that they had been removed via the spam inbox but I wanted to make sure he got responses to each and every post or comment he made to that he had no ability to say it wasn't addressed. I'm confident that if the user is dissatisfied with the responses and it is brought the community, they will feel that the due diligence was done and the outcome was reasonable. It's just 90 days lol if the user would have chilled out with the outbursts they could have campaigned with that user name all they want .. now unfortunately they have locked it up for 90 days and will have to come up with a new strategy to influence the upcoming vote üôÑ

@everyone I would like to purpose that we create a EIP-0027 Discussion thread and sticky it to the top of the reddit page until the vote concludes. We have another post from u/fantoboy that is loaded with factual errors and doesnt offer anything new to the conversation. my fear is that by denying the post his cries of censorship will increase along with the few additional posts that we denied over the past week.


[01/01/2022 5:11 PM] JOFLITO#9983
Happy new year! how about we pin u/fantoboy post and also pin a comment correcting the stuff that's wrong?


[01/01/2022 5:12 PM] Ergonaut_Alpha#1583
my fear is that by denying other posters and then pinning u/fantoboy we are giving some sort of celebrity status when the conversation should be owned by the community.

We can remove posts about eip-0027 that aren't within the stickied thread. That way whenever someone posts errors about the emissions changes in the thread they can be corrected by the community without everything getting too messy. I personally think that it's the best way to go about it, so all the pros/cons and the debacle that comes with it gets contained in one neat thread.

Hey guys, happy holidays! Going to update the banner with the latest iteration. Going to try and keep it updated as close to sigmaverse.io as possible in future as more dApps are developed. Only challenge posed so far is real estate for what is shown on the banner (especially on smaller resolutions - 1920x1080 is the minimum I'm aiming for the key elements to be displayed). Hoping to also have the banner display the newest *main* events for Ergo i.e. Ergohacks etc.

After seeing this (https://www.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/comments/skvtuy/i_found_you_guys/) I'm going to try r/RedditRequest and get mod permissions for r/Ergo. I tried a couple of months ago to no success so I'm going to do what the r/RedditRequest rules say and do the following:
1) PM'ing the mod team (it's just one person)
2) Wait 3 days for a response
3) Post to r/RedditRequest and request access to mod permissions. 

If we can get permissions, I can just redirect people to r/ergonauts with a sticky and restrict posts to try prevent further traffic being sent there and confusing more people.

Quick update regarding acquiring /r/ergo:

Request was denied as the admins said that their was mod activity within the subreddit itself within the last 60 days. Annoying stuff. Not much we can do apart from waiting for another request in a few months time. For now, I might just pop in once in a while to see if there are any lost ergonauts in r/ergo and forward them to r/ergonauts and we do have some community members already doing that which is a bonus.

After that, I had to move to PMs as thats the only way to get a manual check if the above fails:

Thanks for reaching out and sorry about the trouble! We've received similar reports from other users experiencing the same behavior, and this looks like a site-wide issue with Youtube links. We will be in touch to let you know when we have more information from the Youtube team.

Hello Admin & Mods!

Today, we have a new update for slash commands in your servers: **Permissions!** If you don‚Äôt know, slash commands are a new, easier way to use bots on Discord. You might already have some to use‚Äîtype `/` to find out!

With this new system, you can:
:dot:Control who can use slash commands in your servers
:dot:Control in which channels commands can be used
:dot:Sync or unsync commands like channels and categories, making mass management and special cases easy to handle

You can find these permissions in **Server Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Pick an app!** If the app supports slash commands, you‚Äôll see the UI.

‚ö†Ô∏è If a bot you use has integrated slash commands, the old way of denying the bot Read Messages **will not work to moderate commands usage.** You‚Äôll need to use this new system to control access.

Not sure if your bots support slash commands? Check out in **Server Settings ‚Üí Integrations**, or just **type `/`!**

Check out our blog post to learn more and see a detailed walkthrough: https://discord.com/blog/slash-commands-permissions-discord-apps-bots

I know at one point we wouldn't approve this post on r/ergonauts and would sometimes give a reason like "we ask that you keep posts regarding price discussion on r/ErgoTrading" or similar. 

Now we allow everything, but tag with appropriate redirect for either r/ErgoTrading or r/erg_miners.  Which I personally think is a good policy, at least at the moment.

BUT.... I still hesitate to approve really low effort posts like this. What does everyone else think?

Hey Admins & Mods,

Beginning Wednesday, 6/1 we‚Äôre rolling out **Text Chat in Voice Channels** to Discord. With embedded chat in voice channels, your community can send messages, GIFs, links, memes, etc. to everyone in the voice channel‚Äîno more clogging #deleted-channel.

**We are rolling out Text Chat in Voice Channels slowly to all servers throughout the week. Initially, it will not be enabled by default for servers that have greater than 200 members or are set as a Community Server.**

But once you have access‚Ä¶
:dot: You‚Äôll have a new Server Settings tab on the web or your client called *Text in Voice*.
:dot: Turn Text Chat in Voice Channels on for your community by selecting *Enable*.
:dot: Customize permissions for your community, like enabling in specific voice channels or disabling for certain roles. Most developers of your favorite moderation bots have already updated their instances to monitor Text Chat in Voice Channels!

For more details on *Text Chat in Voice Channels*, read our Help Center article here: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412085582359

In four weeks, Text Chat in Voice Channels will be automatically enabled for all servers while still respecting your prescribed permissions‚Äîbut we recommend you enable it early for all your server members to enjoy!

Meet AutoMod, your new best friend in moderation. Designed to reduce work and stress for moderators, AutoMod comes equipped with keyword filters to help keep your server clean and safe around the clock by automatically filtering out harmful or undesirable messages before they‚Äôre posted. Enjoy newfound peace of mind, even when you‚Äôre offline.

Enable AutoMod in **Server Settings > AutoMod**. Once the wheels are turning‚Ä¶

:dot: Choose from readily available keyword filters or customize your own with lists of words or phrases and the actions AutoMod will take when they‚Äôre found in your server.
:dot: AutoMod‚Äôs keyword filters can automatically detect, block, and alert you of messages containing harmful words or phrases‚Äîbefore they‚Äôre ever posted.
:dot: Receive alerts from AutoMod when members try to use words from your lists and assign actions like Timeout from the alert itself.
:dot: Add **Wildcards** to your keywords to detect variations of words that partially match those on your lists. 
     :bluedot: `bake*` ‚áí Today, we **bake**d some coffee cake
     :bluedot: `*milk` ‚áí I add soy**milk** to my coffee
     :bluedot: `*press*` ‚áí A Gibraltar is equal parts es**press**o and milk
:dot: It just works‚Ñ¢Ô∏è on any message sent (i.e., in #text-channels, Threads, Text chat in Voice channels). Check out our Help Center article for all your burning questions. <https://dis.gd/cu-automod-hc>

Working on a FAQ for r/ErgoTrading if anyone has anything to add.

Warning about burning tokens accidentally during a large (token heavy) transaction 

Q: Where can I stake my Erg?
Ergo is PoW, Link to yield page on ergonaut.space & mention upcoming dapps w/ link to sigmaverse.io 
Q: What's the contract address? 
A: Not erc-20 token, Ergo is a Layer 1 PoW chain that is pioneering the extended UTXO ledger model. 
Q:What wallets are popular and does ledger support ERG? 
Link to official wallet page possibly highlight popular options, definitely mention Yoroi being broken for most
Q: So how can I send my ERG to another wallet if Yoroi is unusable?
A: Restore from mnemonic seed phrase 
Q: I heard something about upcoming exchange listing?
A: link to official list of Ergo exchanges, explain NDA, recommend checking weekly AMAs
Q: Question about historical ERG price on CMC?
A: Mainnet went live on July 1 2019, link to EFYT info, link to CMC alternatives 

Thanks for any suggestions

[08/16/2022 5:49 AM] Community Updates#0000
Hey Admins and Moderators,

We've got an update on all things Community today!

If you haven't joined our Discord Admin Community‚Ä¶ what are you waiting for? Head over to **Server Setting > Community overview** and join us ‚Äî we've got a slew of exciting and fun stuff planned that you won‚Äôt want to miss out on.

ü™¥ __*Below is a sneak peek at the Stage events we‚Äôve got cookin‚Äô!*__

:dot: August 16th: Safety on Discord
:dot: August 25th: Utilizing Automod in your Community

To join our Discord Admin Community, your server will need to hit a few engagement requirements. Once your community reaches the requirements listed <https://dis.gd/DAC-FAQ>, any of your Admins or Moderators with the ‚ÄúManage Server‚Äù permission will be able to join the Discord Admin Community via Server Settings > Community.

üìö __**Community Resources**__
We recently released our Community Resources, a one-stop shop for learning how to build, engage, grow, and manage a space where anyone can belong. New articles, showcases, and more will be added in the future, so be sure to bookmark it for later. <https://dis.gd/Community_Resources>

If you haven't already taken a peek at some of our content, you can check out the latest video! https://dis.gd/H2M_Your_Discord_Community

ü§ñ **__Apps & Bots__**
If your server uses a **verified app**, the way you send commands has probably changed in the last year - if it hasn‚Äôt, it may very soon! Developers of verified apps have been migrating to Slash Commands. The deadline to finish migrating is the end of August, which means on Sept 1, any apps that haven‚Äôt finished may have reduced functionality.

If you haven‚Äôt tried out slash commands yet, type / in your server to see all the commands you have access to. If your favorite app isn‚Äôt listed, they may not yet have enabled slash commands. Or, you might need to check out the new permissions system in **Server Settings > Integrations.**

If you run across any issues, you can reach out to individual app developers to find out more. Learn more here: <https://discord.com/blog/welcome-to-the-new-era-of-discord-apps>

[08/17/2022 5:14 PM] Gstoiti#2984
I noticed that the bridge bot doesn't delete all messages which we delete in the  German telegram group. For example, some verification codes and scam messages are still visible in the discord channel. Although the majority of the German community uses telegram, I would like to keep the channel clean for new users joining in telegram (especially since the bridge bot messages are already confusing enough). Is that fixable with other bot settings? Or can I also be moderator for the discord channel to delete the messages manually?


[08/17/2022 5:17 PM] glasgowm#9381
Telegram API doesn't report deleted msg's - so not fixable( 

You should have mod rights there already due to the sigmanauts role I think

You're response was helpful! But still haven't figured it out TBH. Thought maybe it was because of a recent app update but after rereading your message you're using the official reddit app on Android as well so IDK. Frustrating but comes with the territory I'm learning lol.

Is there a ban on telegram links at the reddit admin level? Posts with tg links get stuck in the mod queue and can't be approved. I tried having u/_Geros_  resubmit the Sigma Valley treasure hunt announcement sans tg links, but adding them in after approval bumped the post right back to the mod queue @glasgowm


[08/26/2022 7:51 PM] glasgowm#9381
Yep sounds like blacklisted

üëÄ 

[08/27/2022 6:09 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
Reddit mods idk how many are in here üòÖ but I've seen some financial help subreddits (and probably others) that require links be posted in full plain-text format. Should we consider implementing a similar rule? I would think we could still use custom hyperlinks in wiki and sidebar ? just require links in posts and comments to be full links? Or is that stupid?


[08/27/2022 7:59 AM] dashmunn#0001
I don't think that would get around the blacklist. If it did, I would be surprised that reddit would implement such an easily bypassed filter.


[08/27/2022 8:00 AM] dashmunn#0001
I personally post raw links due to old reddit/3rd party app compatibility. Sometimes links get a random backslash added to urls but majority of traffic uses new reddit and those who use old reddit are usually tech savvy enough to know where to find the link being posted.


[08/27/2022 8:02 AM] dashmunn#0001
Yeah, that was annoying to see the mining telegram link blacklisted. Might be better to just direct people to our linktree if automod detects a ergo telegram link posted. Would have to look into it.


[08/27/2022 5:07 PM] Affable Villain#4533
That's a good idea. I'll start suggesting the linktree as a workaround. Thanks


[08/28/2022 8:25 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
There's telegram links on top menu of r/ErgoTrading ? I wonder how I got around that since telegram is blacklisted?

No I'm not referring to the blacklisting of telegram,  I think some subreddits have that rule I mentioned to reduce malicious links.


[08/28/2022 8:29 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
Or at least that's their goal


[08/28/2022 9:09 AM] dashmunn#0001
The blacklist only scans reddit comments to my knowledge. You can have any link you want on the custom frontend widgets. i.e. the top banner links


[08/28/2022 9:11 AM] dashmunn#0001
Message came through on my private channel.

Ill check out the subreddit automod rules to see if we have a blacklist rule once im at my computer*


[08/28/2022 10:45 AM] dashmunn#0001
No rules found. Its definitely a reddit blacklist.


[08/28/2022 11:03 AM] dashmunn#0001
going to try whitelist the telegram urls through an automod rule.

Telegram links in weekly discussion thread were triggering reddit filter. 

After manually trying to approve (didn't work), I went a different route and have removed the Telegram links from the Weekly Discussion body and have replaced it with a link to our LinkTree.

Changed the scheduled post config to trigger the automod to repost it and am now reverting it back to it's original scheduled time.

Very weird. It's hard to debug what could be causing the messages to not appear. I would just delete the channel and recreate it again to see if that changes anything.


[09/02/2022 7:34 PM] Rishabh#7490
Is there any other method to do this like any bot ?


[09/03/2022 10:34 AM] dashmunn#0001
not to my knowledge, this is the easiest way to follow a discord channel. using a bot would just complicate things imo as youd need admin permissions iirc

I've removed the obvious bots, hard to tell which ones are just old accounts and new ergo users vs old bot accounts.

Hard to tell, bots go after them on Twitter too but don't think it's the OP orchestrating it.

Do you want to be a mod for /r/erg_miners btw @TypoDaPsycho. It would make more sense to have all the moderators be able to access the related subreddits to help out in regards to keeping info updated. Not sure if Den_Ace is still active in the community. He hasn't posted in months (apart from the scheduled 51% reminder post he's set on his account)


[09/07/2022 10:24 AM] dashmunn#0001
Might reach out to Fathers_Folly as well as he's always active in the ergonauts subreddit.

I could be wrong, but doesn't that role require being in Sigmanauts program? ü§î

No, i was in contributors for a couple months before becoming sigmanaut


[09/08/2022 10:51 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
Hell yeah I didn't know that was possible. It only makes sense though now that I think about it. We want more contributors not less.  Satergo would be good for the role then I think! 

@glasgowm is this something we should create a thread for in main #sigmanauts-archive  ?


[09/08/2022 11:18 AM] glasgowm#9381

Hey Admins and Mods!

In our mission to help you keep your communities safe and lift some of that moderation work off your shoulders, we‚Äôve set our sights on helping you more easily detect and prevent spam and raids. Today's spotlight introduces new features that help keep your communities cleaner from spam, and a preview into our early plans on building tools to deal with raids.

:automod: **Keep your Community clean from spam with new AutoMod spam filters**
We know dealing with spammy messages sucks. If *only* there was a way spammy messages could be blocked from being posted in your channels and threads in the first place‚Ä¶ 

Thankfully, every community‚Äôs best friend in moderation - **AutoMod** - just got buffed with some new spam-cleansing abilities. Enable AutoMod in **Server Settings > AutoMod** to save hours of moderation work with these new filters:
:dot:**Block Mention Spam** - Detect and block mention spam and mention raids before they happen to keep chat clean and prevent members in your community from receiving annoying mention notifications and ghost pings. Set your own limit on the number of mentions a message may contain (up to 50). 
:dot: **Block Spam Content** - Detect and block messages containing text content that has been widely flagged as spam by user reports. Great for blocking unwanted spam like those pesky free Nitro scams, unsolicited advertisements, and invite spam that disrupt your Community's friendly conversations and game nights.
Check out our updated AutoMod FAQ help article: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4421269296535-AutoMod-FAQ

**Our early plans and progress to protect communities from raids**
We know being raided is one of the worst experiences you and your Community can go through which is why we‚Äôre giving you a heads up that we‚Äôre exploring ways to better detect and prevent raids before they take place, while making it easier to de-escalate a raid when they do happen.

While we‚Äôre in the earlier stages of progress here at Discord Labs‚Ñ¢, rest assured we‚Äôre eager to equip you with effective tools to more easily deal with raids as quickly as we can. So what can you do now?
:dot: **Report Raids**: You can now directly send us feedback reports when a raid is taking place in your server by going to your Server Dropdown and selecting Report Raid. If your Community is being raided, we encourage you to partner with us in our moderation efforts by reporting the situation as we‚Äôll be regularly reviewing your raid reports to develop tooling that combat raids. 
:dot: **Pause invitations** to your Community at anytime - You can now pause your invite links for when you want to temporarily prevent people from joining your server without having to revoking your invite links or vanity URLs - just head over to **Server Settings > Invites**. 
Because this cuts off the flow of new arrivals, you'll have an easier time halting a raid in progress. It also lets well-intentioned community members trying to join know that the stoppage is temporary, and that soon, they‚Äôll be able to come back to the same link and try again.
Learn more about pausing invites: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8458903738647

**How we‚Äôre protecting communities from suspicious links: **
To help y‚Äôall with the legwork in dealing with messages containing malicious links, we‚Äôve buffed every Community server with a proactive suspicious link filter designed to detect and block messages containing links that are verified to be harmful, such as those leading to malware or phishing sites that try to steal people‚Äôs personal or financial information. We‚Äôll be continuously working on identifying links that might mislead or redirect users by reviewing a regularly updated list of unsafe and phishing websites: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/7326747355159-Why-was-my-message-not-delivered-

Hey Admins and Mods,

Y‚Äôall ready for some of that ~ juicy ~ product news?

After a bunch of testing, we‚Äôre excited to begin rolling out Forum Channels across Community servers!

Forum Channels are a new type of channel that provide a dedicated, organized space for conversations. Since conversations are contained in individual posts, your members can browse topics before jumping in‚Äîwithout worrying about breaking up or getting in the way of other on-going conversations.

If you‚Äôve been waiting for this news in anticipation and are ready to dive right in, go right ahead and click that Create Channel button. You should see that forum channels are now an option for you. If it‚Äôs not, you may be part of a small group of users who will have to wait just a little longer. (:soontm:)

Want to do a bit more deep thonking and research around how to best use Forum Channels before diving in? The following article on our Community Resources site will guide you on your journey to reaching forum Valhalla: <https://discord.com/community/creating-value-with-conversation>

I added Medical-Result4453 to filter for mod review in automod settings, post history shows genuine (low quality) engagement in past but has devolved into generic "Ergo sucks" type comments. Should I have just banned instead of filtered?

I switched the link filter to 'all' on r/ergonauts so we'll have to approve links even in comments I think, there's a way to automod filtering only specific YouTube channels/ videos but filter all links probably isn't a bad idea anyway since we're a crypto sub? Idk tell me what you think

I believe so, it's just a matter of setting up a whitelist for urls akin to this: https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoModerator/comments/li2eez/whitelist_links_onlyhelp/

we'd just need a list of urls we want to allow, obvs ones being anything ergoplatform yt channel etc.

We pretty much already have to approve 99% of posts, this is just on comment level I'm referring to. And yeah my  punctuation isn't clear above I know there's a way, and if you want to do that it's probably the best choice I'm just being lazy


[10/14/2022 8:19 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
But I was taking the opposite approach and trying to auto filter certain channels or videos, but instead white listing makes more sense

Previously r/ErgoTrading was all one page in markdown format. But I wanted the idex to be an actual index with links. 

Initially created the new wiki pages under r/ErgoTrading/wiki/index/ which is wrong I guess.

 I can't delete wiki pages so tried to create new pages at correct r/ErgoTrading/wiki/  

Without  index/ 

And just make the index ones viewable by mod only


[10/27/2022 11:12 PM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
It worked for some of them. But for some reason, it created some pages at a totally different yet still incorrect location; I didn't knowingly set "about" as parent in this case? 

here's an example here: https://www.reddit.r/ErgoTrading/about/wiki/

I looked into it. Reddit doesnt allow you to delete wiki pages once theyve been created (very annoying that they dont have something so basic).

If you want the structure to be /ErgoTrading/wiki/ChildPage, you have to recreate them manually and then hide the old pages from being edited (and probably blank them entirely to indicate that theyre obsolete).


[10/31/2022 10:43 AM] dashmunn#0001
Thoughts on adding an English only rule? Only because its hard to moderate posts when we don't know what the OP is saying and having to use google translate becomes cumbersome. I also dont think other redditors would like to see posts they themselves cant read.

Awesome üôÇ I'll update the subreddit rules soon and I think there are some automod rules to detect non-english posts. If possible, I'll customise the automod message with a link to our linktree. (As telegram links are kind of a grey area with the filter)

Thinking about making a "posts must be tagged" rule on both- r/ErgoTrading (for organizational sake)  and r/ergonauts (to save time on moderation). 

What would everyone think about that?


[11/03/2022 12:02 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
I could start with Trading and then if there's no issues with that we could add the rule to r/ergonauts after


[11/03/2022 12:16 AM] dashmunn#0001
My only concern is that people mislabel posts but I think that can be easily resolve as most of the subreddit mods check the subreddits multiple times a day. Regardless, happy to see the change be implemented. @Affable Villain thoughts?

TBH I don't keep my eyes on r/ErgoTrading like I do r/ergonauts so the mislabeling issue could be worse on Trading sub. But the tag list is more extensive on trading so we can try it out. 

On r/ergonauts we approve and currently tag majority of posts, now we would have to approve and simply review tag. 

I'll  review and add more tags to r/ergonauts before adding the rule to it though.

Automod seems to remove any and all YouTube links now. Seems that could detract from productive discussion and limit a lot of legitimate posts/responses. For example, it just removed a link to the DeCo YouTube channel. Maybe we could change the automod action from "remove" to "filter" so we just catch the spam links before anyone sees/reports them. What do you think?


[11/05/2022 6:10 PM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
Sorry just now seeing this, I think the issue is did automod remove YouTube links in comments prior?


[11/05/2022 6:11 PM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
But either way, yes definitely I'll change it to filter when I get a second


[11/05/2022 6:33 PM] TypoDaPsycho#6307

[11/05/2022 6:33 PM] TypoDaPsycho#6307

[11/05/2022 6:33 PM] Affable Villain#4533
No, it never did. I figured if it's set to filter, it's an easy catch since the spam links are almost always posted 3-5 at a time


[11/05/2022 6:34 PM] Affable Villain#4533
Okay. Yeah, I think it might just be trading one headache for another


[11/08/2022 9:54 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
So what I've been doing on r/ergonauts is manually switching flair from 'Needs help' to 'Solved' once it seems appropriate. But then the sub goes from mostly "needs help", to mostly "solved" lol. So then after a day or so, I'm trying to switch flair to final & more specific flairs like '"wallets", or whatever is best fit. Anyone else doing similar?


[11/08/2022 9:59 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
But maybe I should make new flairs so that instead of "WALLET" we can choose "WALLET- SOLVED", or maybe we should just skip the "SOLVED" flair altogether... IDK

[11/09/2022 8:08 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
"I have two subs that I moderate that were getting a lot of YouTube channel spam. I set up Automoderator to remove the posts and then send modmail to myself to review the submission. If it's spam, I deal with it. If the content is relevant, I approve it."

standard: video hosting sites
action: remove
modmail: The submission by /u/{{author}} is a video. Please review for spam.

That would be good if it works correctly?


[11/09/2022 8:10 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
Probably be better if we also (or instead?) whitelist the few regular posters who share YouTube content


[11/09/2022 12:04 PM] Affable Villain#4533
I think most of the content creators are already approved users and wouldn't be affected. If you feel having mod mail notifications for video links is beneficial, we can try that, but I think we're pretty diligent about keeping the queue clear and just filtering would be sufficient

I would like a policy regarding moderator counts so we avoid ever being in a situation where one person can highjack the sub or do other scammy type things.

[11/10/2022 6:37 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
Awesome thanks we needed to do that!

But I also think we need to consider reworking the sub rules to better reflect what we are actually going to enforce. 

I'm conflicted because I like r/ergonauts being active and people getting access to help they need. But the quality of posts sometimes make the front page be half filled with one paragraph posts, talking about market conditions or price,  that would better on r/ErgoTrading.

But when we enforced the rules strictly, it wasn't worth the pushback and angry messages IMO. At some point when Ergo is bigger, we will have to start being stricter about what we allow.

The current matrix channels and space are on the matrix.org homeserver. 

Matrix documention and ettiquette recommend users and channel managers move off of the matrix.org homeserver as soon as possible after registering to reduce load on that server, and increase decentralization of the fediverse.

I dont hold much hope matrix will last/care about it's decentralisation - should really be built into the client already, seems switching entirely would also add inevitable downtime/maintenance. But if you add in the bridge bot (or create your own and send me the details - not sure how it works with other servers) can add it in a loop on the bridge

"I dont hold much hope matrix will last/care about it's decentralisation" Not with that attitude! Decentralization is built on effort, and education.

" should really be built into the client already" Which part? switching of channels and spaces from one homeserver to another is supported by both of the clients that I have tried:  Element (the most popular) and Cinny (the most similar to discord and my favorite)


[11/12/2022 9:41 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Regarding bridge bots: I intend to have the homeserver manage bridgebots between discord/ telegram/ matrix for any and all channels within whatever space ends up on the homeserver. Be that the existing space if you are willing to migrate, or any other if you are unwilling.

The homeserver doesn't have to be responsible for it's own bridgebots if you are happy to continue to maintain them üôÇ


[11/12/2022 9:44 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Regarding potential downtime: Currently I have only one server, and no users. If demand grows, the home server can be migrated to Kubernetes or Flux as needed to mitigate any downtime.

Once a matrix space is fully (every channel) bridged to discord and telegram, the consequences of eventual downtime can be mitigated as willing users could simply continue their discussion on one of those centralized services.


[11/12/2022 9:48 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
I also think it may be possible to have space/channels present on several homeservers simultaneously. Meaning migrating may not be a requirement, and duplication without the need for bots between matrix homeserver-homeserver would be possible further reducing the risk of any downtime. If this is true it would simply mean that the homeserver can serve as a method for reducing potential censorship of the ergo community which is the goal anyway üôÇ


[11/12/2022 9:50 PM] WilfordGrimley#0124
Here is an example of the way spaces can be used with the cinny client to replicated the subgrouping feature of discord.

Decentralisation will need to be effortless, or it won't work.

> Which part?

All of it. Looks like they are planning this for their next homeserver release tho; https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite

> Regarding bridge bots: I intend to have the homeserver manage bridgebots between discord/ telegram/ matrix for any and all channels within whatever space ends up on the homeserver. Be that the existing space if you are willing to migrate, or any other if you are unwilling.

Not sure what this means, how does the server manage bots?

Not sure the significance of being able to do it without bots, but that is possible via them anyway.

"Decentralization will need to be effortless, or it won't work."

I see your point. The end user shoudn't need to manually opt for decentralization, and to that end federated services without a method to automatically manage decentralization in some P2P way are doomed to fail.

To get to the point of effortless decentralization massive massive efforts will be required by developers and community leaders to educate users on the importance of decentralization. It will require effort to build decentralized systems, and effort to mitigate centralization as time passes.

The Decentralization heading of Ergo's social contract covers this well.



I will have to look further into dendrite, thanks for the link. üôÇ Always happy to see projects written in GO.

Regarding bots: the ansible playbook I am using at the moment to manage the homeserver runs many different services as docker containers on a single server and configures them to work with one another.

"Note sure the significance of being able to do it without bots, but that is possible via them anyway"

The advantage of using the native federation of Matrix over bots (for duplicating across homeservers) is a reduced memory load and increased confidence that the data has not been tampered with. Matrix enables users to verify one another. If I see glasgow:matrix.org comment in a channel in matrix and I have verified you, I can be more confident that it is you than if a bot duplicated your comment in a different channel/space.

Yes this is what I was getting at, sorry was very hungover) But Dendrite does look interesting

fair enough, lmk if you need anything from me. I have access to my own account and the bot one, but think I made the original a while back under an anon account then forgot the pw.

Hey Admins,

This year, we learned that a lot of new members have a tough time joining communities. Complicated verification gates, confusing bot commands, or seeing 27 million channels on their channel lists are all common reasons why new members say it‚Äôs challenging to join and become part of a community on Discord.

So we built a better way to welcome new members and grow your tribe heading into 2023: **Community Onboarding**.

With Community Onboarding, you can create the perfect starting experience for everyone:

:dot: Pick **Default Channels** every new member starts with
:dot: Ask **Customization Questions** that assign roles and additional channels
:dot: New members get a tidy personalized channel list so it‚Äôs easier to explore
:dot: Enjoy added protection from join-raids with new, automated **Raid Protection**

Community Onboarding is currently available to Partnered servers and Community servers with 5,000 or more people! Find it in** Server Settings** >** Onboarding**.  <https://dis.gd/Onboarding>

Learn how to set up Onboarding today: https://dis.gd/how-to-set-up-Onboarding

Stay cozy and enjoy the holidays everyone! :wumpuswave:

Can we remove the automod on new posts for now


[01/19/2023 2:52 AM] Affable Villain#4533
I'm not the most familiar with automod, but I can't see anything that should be filtering accounts older than 30 days. Until someone else can look at it, I just added Gazza and your alt account as approved users in automod


[01/20/2023 3:06 AM] dashmunn#0001
Only other filter rules are the "key word" filters that get triggered for the most common words that usually indicate the post should be redirected to r/ergotrading or r/erg_miners

I think that account must be white-listed or something since they never ban it.

These spambots are doing my head in. Got a bot on tg that catches them, but clicking into their profiles they don't even appear to be in the room so idk how they're sending messages. Maybe they leave straight away but nothing in the logs (Tg logs suck baws tho). 

AutoMod on Discord doesn't seem to work on webhooks, so be extra vigilant for bridged spam while I find another solution please

@T U L O (ErgoMinnow) was curious how many Reddit mods we have. also, when a post is created what the process is (ie if the post is about trading and should go into r/ergotrading, is this an automated process? or are mods able to message that person and let them know why the post was removed?)

Minnow, anything you'd like to add?


[03/14/2023 8:55 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Thats about the gist of it. Having our posts removed when we have no idea why makes us feel censored.


[03/14/2023 8:56 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
My post was removed. Even if some think it doesnt have 'substance', gatekeeping which comments are important enough to be posted is an awful way to run the subreddit.

[03/14/2023 8:56 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
If its the fact that it just belongs in trading, sure no problem.


[03/14/2023 8:57 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
I just didnt like having my post removed with no message of why.


[03/14/2023 8:57 PM] crandano#8951
this scenario is tough because it is about trading so for some people it's obvious why it doesn't belong in the main subreddit. but i get why someone would want a reply. would it help to have more moderators in this case?


[03/14/2023 8:57 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
People have been complaining that the subreddit is dead and this doesnt help.


[03/14/2023 8:57 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Theres also the problem of many ergonauts only knowing about the main subreddit and not knowing a trading one even exists.


[03/14/2023 9:07 PM] crandano#8951
Is the trading channel in the FAQ? If not, could be mentioned

Otherwise, it‚Äôs like most crypto communities. There‚Äôs main channels and trade channels. I get how a message why it‚Äôs removed would be nice


[03/14/2023 9:14 PM] T U L O (ErgoMinnow)#6385
Yeah r/cryptocurrency will tell you why a post is removed which is nice.


[03/14/2023 9:43 PM] Affable Villain#4533
Your post was removed by automod and an automated message reply was given within said post, asking you to direct it to r/ErgoTrading, since this particular post was 100% trading focused. Sometimes posts are more generally themed with some trading discussion thrown in, or traffic is slow that day and mods will override the automod

All of Reddit seems to be down at the moment, that's probably why the automod's reply isn't showing currently.

Can someone remove & can we get some more mods - @CW maybe? Anyone else keen? :)


[03/15/2023 12:18 PM] glasgowm#9381
Spend some time as a mod in the bull and you'll see why those filters are in place. Sometimes half a dozen of those posts in a day of remarkably low effort some times. During the bear the filters can probably be reduced though. Better the main sub is busier.

Investigated Collections, which function as Reddit's post playlists. Added onto the established Weekly Discussion Collection by w0mb022, and created two additional collections for Weekly Developer Updates and Weekly AMAs. In total, three collections have been set up.


[03/16/2023 4:35 AM] Affable Villain#4533
Added "airdrop" to the automod to filter for mod review as scam posts have been pretty steady for a few weeks now


[03/16/2023 5:35 AM] dashmunn#0001
Automod doesn't support collections, rip. Will have to just manually add them to their respective collections. üò™


[03/17/2023 3:23 AM] Affable Villain#4533
Also added "arbitrum" to the automod filter until this wave of nonsense ends

Looks like the sam phishing methods with the @KaspaCurrency discord community, it looks like the scammers are spreading and finding their way to other crypto-projects. @MiningRabid Another topic for your youtube channel i guess...

Hey Admins and Mods,

Beginning on March 31, over the next several weeks we will start to roll out a new feature called **Soundboard**. This feature will let users upload custom short sounds to their servers, and then use those sounds to communicate in Voice Channels. 

Click here to learn more about soundboard: <https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/12612888127767-Soundboard-FAQ#h_01GTYZSTZQV1GXSRVX1A420WPX>

To help you keep your server safe, we have already released some new permissions around Soundboard. You can now access and configure these permissions directly from Server Settings:
- **Use Soundboard:** Determines who in your server is able to use soundboard.
- **Manage Expressions:** Determines who in your server is able to upload and manage sounds.

Visit the help center article linked above to read more about Soundboard permissions!

Peace and Love,
Discord Team
