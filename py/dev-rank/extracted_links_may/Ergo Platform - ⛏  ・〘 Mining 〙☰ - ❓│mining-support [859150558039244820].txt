[06/28/2021 8:54 PM] Terremot#4855
Thanks.  I appreciate you posting that here


[06/28/2021 8:57 PM] andee#4722
I have seen people say that they need to keep the monitor turned on, is it the second or main GPU that drops?


[06/28/2021 8:58 PM] Terremot#4855
Yes, as soon as I disconnect teamviewer the hash rate drops


[06/28/2021 8:58 PM] Terremot#4855
I've just read that I may need to use Gen 3 for the 3060s


[06/28/2021 8:58 PM] Terremot#4855
so I'll try that in a while


[06/28/2021 9:00 PM] andee#4722
have you tried dummy plug on both gpu's?


[06/28/2021 9:01 PM] Terremot#4855
yup


[06/28/2021 9:01 PM] Terremot#4855
Gen 2 apparently not good enough and needs to be Gen 3


[06/28/2021 9:01 PM] Terremot#4855
next thing to try


[06/28/2021 9:02 PM] Terremot#4855
If that works, it's worth having that pinned as a 3060 support topic


[06/28/2021 9:05 PM] Terremot#4855
Essentially, the hash rate drops every time the screen becomes inactive


[06/28/2021 9:06 PM] Terremot#4855
and none of the settings in the NVidia control panel is below maximum power


[06/28/2021 9:06 PM] Terremot#4855
and adjusted all the windows power settings


[06/28/2021 9:07 PM] andee#4722
old or new type LHR?


[06/28/2021 9:07 PM] Terremot#4855
both are new type lhr


[06/28/2021 9:07 PM] Terremot#4855
one is 100% stable


[06/28/2021 9:07 PM] andee#4722
you could add your oc to the spreadsheet and add the extra information


[06/28/2021 9:08 PM] andee#4722
have you checked that device id is 2504? several people has claimed they have the new type, but then they check and its the earlier version


[06/28/2021 9:08 PM] Terremot#4855
interesting


[06/28/2021 9:09 PM] Terremot#4855
both are 2054


[06/28/2021 9:18 PM] andee#4722
disable automatic disabling of monitor and use a black screensaver üôÇ


[06/28/2021 9:19 PM] Terremot#4855
blank or black?


[06/28/2021 9:20 PM] Terremot#4855
I had the screensaver off


[06/28/2021 9:22 PM] andee#4722
I have no idea, just something dark so it looks like the screen is off. I just know that one guy bypassed it by making sure the monitor was on constantly


[06/28/2021 9:23 PM] Terremot#4855
I have no screensaver so it should technically be active


[06/28/2021 9:23 PM] Terremot#4855
I've set a screensaver to see if that makes a difference


[06/28/2021 9:24 PM] Terremot#4855
just wiggle the mouse to deactivate it


[06/28/2021 9:24 PM] andee#4722
I don't think it will. but when does the problem occur? usually monitors goes idle after x amount of time


[06/28/2021 9:24 PM] Terremot#4855
A minute or two after disconnecting from teamviewer


[06/28/2021 9:25 PM] andee#4722
so you have no screen connected?


[06/28/2021 9:25 PM] Terremot#4855
nope


[06/28/2021 9:25 PM] Terremot#4855
just HDMI plugs


[06/28/2021 9:25 PM] andee#4722
then keep teamviewer connected üôÇ


[06/28/2021 9:25 PM] Terremot#4855
That will be expensive


[06/28/2021 9:26 PM] andee#4722
how?


[06/28/2021 9:26 PM] Terremot#4855
If I use it constantly, it will be considered for professional use


[06/28/2021 9:26 PM] Terremot#4855
and it costs something like ¬£40 per month


[06/28/2021 9:33 PM] andee#4722
@Terremot try this maybe? https://www.amyuni.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3030

[06/28/2021 9:35 PM] andee#4722
or try remote desktop by microsoft


[06/28/2021 9:35 PM] andee#4722
the driver probably detects that there is no EDID from the monitor, as the dummys are usually just a resistor soldered on 2 pins


[06/28/2021 9:35 PM] Terremot#4855
yeah, that's the problem.  I don't want my PC left on all the time


[06/28/2021 9:35 PM] andee#4722
then try the other thing I posted


[06/28/2021 9:36 PM] andee#4722
you need to fake that a monitor is connected since the dummy seems to dumb for the driver


[06/28/2021 9:36 PM] Terremot#4855
I'll give that a try, thanks


[06/28/2021 9:38 PM] andee#4722
it may not work since it seems like it fakes a display connected via usb, but since a virtual monitor works via teamviewer it may work


[06/28/2021 9:44 PM] Terremot#4855
Just waiting to for the hash rate to increase to the proper level on the 3060 in question


[06/28/2021 9:47 PM] Terremot#4855
hmm


[06/28/2021 9:47 PM] Terremot#4855
it's now not even going up in hashrate


[06/28/2021 9:47 PM] Terremot#4855
will reboot my rig and see


[06/28/2021 9:55 PM] Terremot#4855
hmm


[06/28/2021 9:55 PM] Terremot#4855
okay...I've got the full hash rate of the cards and then closed MSI afterburner again


[06/28/2021 9:55 PM] Terremot#4855
without using that software, I'll see if it can stay the same


[06/28/2021 9:55 PM] Terremot#4855
if not, I'll use the software and see what happens


[06/28/2021 10:00 PM] Terremot#4855
this time, I got the hash rates up, then closed (rather than minimised) MSI Afterburner


[06/28/2021 10:00 PM] Terremot#4855
I'll see what happens


[06/28/2021 10:06 PM] Terremot#4855
Well fingers crossed, it seems to be working right now


[06/28/2021 10:06 PM] Terremot#4855
at 480mhs on my 4 card rig


[06/28/2021 10:07 PM] Terremot#4855
looks like closing afterburner keeps it stable


[06/28/2021 10:07 PM] Terremot#4855
but I'll keep an eye out watching it


[06/28/2021 10:15 PM] Terremot#4855
fail


[06/28/2021 10:15 PM] Terremot#4855
ok, I'll enable that screen and what happens


[06/28/2021 10:31 PM] Terremot#4855
nope


[06/28/2021 10:31 PM] Terremot#4855
no change


[06/28/2021 10:32 PM] Terremot#4855
there's a different way of disabling hardware acceleration of graphics via windows 21h1


[06/28/2021 10:32 PM] Terremot#4855
but can't remember


[06/28/2021 10:34 PM] andee#4722
can you connect your rig to itself using windows remote?


[06/28/2021 10:37 PM] Terremot#4855
That's the next thing I'll check


[06/28/2021 10:37 PM] Terremot#4855
I've just turned off hardware graphic acceleration


[06/28/2021 10:37 PM] Terremot#4855
as I don't know if that affects mining


[06/28/2021 10:39 PM] andee#4722
has never affected my desktop, but who knows


[06/28/2021 10:40 PM] andee#4722
on linux it takes a couple of minutes to add a fake monitor, seems difficult on windows


[06/28/2021 10:40 PM] Terremot#4855
This issue I have seems unique


[06/28/2021 10:40 PM] Terremot#4855
no-one else I know has reported it


[06/28/2021 10:41 PM] andee#4722
I know one other guy said he had the same problem, but he had a display connected so he just kept it on


[06/28/2021 10:42 PM] andee#4722
many don't even get past 70-90MH, so you are in a better situation than a lot of people I think


[06/28/2021 10:53 PM] Terremot#4855
oh, I'm surprised


[06/29/2021 1:29 AM] ysfbeck#3873
Hello, i need a guide on how to mine Ergo with nicehash please

{Reactions}
üí© (3) 

[06/29/2021 1:31 AM] tflynn#6411
Isnt nicehash only for earning bitcoin


[06/29/2021 1:31 AM] ysfbeck#3873
Yes it is


[06/29/2021 1:35 AM] tflynn#6411
Ahh so u dont believe in ergo as a platform then. Just btc. Do you want to rent or use your own gpu to mine. I cant help if its renting.


[06/29/2021 7:09 AM] ysfbeck#3873
I want to mine with my gpu


[06/29/2021 9:41 AM] andee#4722
@ysfbeck find their discord, I don't think there are many nicehash users here


[06/29/2021 10:20 AM] Terremot#4855
I gave up and switched the 3060 for a 3080


[06/29/2021 10:22 AM] Terremot#4855
getting 220mhs at a nice cool 55¬∞C, which is pretty good for a gigabyte card


[06/29/2021 10:24 AM] andee#4722
when you have that luxury there are no problems üòÜ


[06/29/2021 11:07 AM] Terremot#4855
I noticed that the MUtl is fluctuating wildly on the 3060

some have bypassed it by opening a browser and starting a video on youtube ü§î


[06/29/2021 11:22 AM] andee#4722
others have reported that fine tuning of clocks have made it better, but there was a problem with some auto boost kicking in


[06/29/2021 11:35 AM] Terremot#4855
switched to conflux instead on that card


[06/29/2021 11:35 AM] Terremot#4855
I've got 596mhs on my rig now


[06/29/2021 11:35 AM] Terremot#4855
so one malfunctioning lhr card isn't going to be a problem


[06/29/2021 1:30 PM] andee#4722
@Jason K difficulty does not affect your hashrate


[06/29/2021 1:31 PM] andee#4722
what you show on your screen is share difficulty, which is adjusted based on the performance of your rig


[06/29/2021 1:31 PM] Jason K#5020
Hmm


[06/29/2021 1:32 PM] andee#4722
does your 24H average not match?

[06/29/2021 1:34 PM] Jason K#5020
24 hr is very low


[06/29/2021 1:34 PM] andee#4722
stale shares, choose the server closest to you to have as low latency as possible


[06/29/2021 1:34 PM] andee#4722
and what does the miner report?


[06/29/2021 1:36 PM] Jason K#5020
The 24hr is about 3x lower than it should be on bottom miner


[06/29/2021 1:37 PM] Jason K#5020
It's 2 3060, 1 1070 and 1 1080 btw, the 111hash bottom line


[06/29/2021 1:39 PM] andee#4722
I need to see something from the actual miner

[06/29/2021 1:42 PM] Jason K#5020
1 1070 is off atm


[06/29/2021 1:43 PM] andee#4722
and where is the other erg worker?


[06/29/2021 1:44 PM] Jason K#5020
At a buddies far away, he's running 3x 3060


[06/29/2021 1:45 PM] andee#4722
without any output from the miner its impossible to guess at anything


[06/29/2021 1:46 PM] andee#4722
have you verified that the low hashrate worker is not the one with your friend?


[06/29/2021 1:46 PM] Jason K#5020
I don't think I can remote screenshot the miner from Linux,  I'll grab a Pic when home


[06/29/2021 1:47 PM] Jason K#5020
My worker is the low one, tho you can see it's at 300, but 100 reported


[06/29/2021 1:47 PM] andee#4722
seems you just started. look at what the 6 hour average says after 6 actual hours of mining


[06/29/2021 1:49 PM] Jason K#5020
Oh, the low uptime is cuz one 1070 got moved to pheonixminer algo.


[06/29/2021 1:49 PM] Jason K#5020
That's only 50 hash less tho, used to be 350


[06/29/2021 1:50 PM] Jason K#5020
But yeah, I should monitor miner screen for errors


[06/29/2021 1:52 PM] andee#4722
you could join herominers discord and have them take a look at it. 100% accepted according to hive interface


[06/29/2021 1:52 PM] Jason K#5020
Interesting ok


[06/29/2021 1:55 PM] Jason K#5020
Buddy has a poor connection most times, that's prob why he has high stale rate


[06/29/2021 1:56 PM] Jason K#5020
So that's 1 issue, thx


[06/29/2021 1:56 PM] andee#4722
I think herominers counts stale shares unless its really excessive


[06/29/2021 1:56 PM] Spheny#8442
why is my PL going above 150 even though I have it set

is PL even applicable to AMD cards?


[06/29/2021 2:01 PM] andee#4722
isn't core state and voltage the way to reduce W?


[06/29/2021 2:01 PM] Jason K#5020

[06/29/2021 2:09 PM] andee#4722
probably because vega has different options


[06/29/2021 2:10 PM] andee#4722
then my guess would be that the lower limit in bios is higher than the 150W you set


[06/29/2021 2:10 PM] Spheny#8442
so i need to find some bios?


[06/29/2021 2:11 PM] TSNP#1337
Someone having luck with 6900XT?


[06/29/2021 2:11 PM] TSNP#1337
Idk if this is normal, but my hashrate is just 110 MH/s


[06/29/2021 2:12 PM] TSNP#1337
When I can get up to 70 MH/s in ethereum at very low wattage


[06/29/2021 2:13 PM] andee#4722
that is the curse on the new gen amd's, they are not really good for autolykos2


[06/29/2021 2:14 PM] TSNP#1337
u.u


[06/29/2021 6:28 PM] Terremot#4855
Watching a video makes the hashrate stable as you said.  So now, with rig and PC, I've got a hashrate of 697mhs


[06/29/2021 6:28 PM] Terremot#4855
not too shabby


[06/30/2021 12:06 AM] Jason K#5020
Anyone have any ideas why my miners hashrate is 50%+ less than my pools reported rate?


[06/30/2021 12:07 AM] Jason K#5020
Sorry* pool reported rate is far lower than miner is reporting


[06/30/2021 12:08 AM] Nythain#6769
Depends on the pool, how lucky youve been with shares and which pool hashrate youre looking at.


[06/30/2021 12:10 AM] Jason K#5020
I have 2 small farms, mining to same pool same address, one is reporting correctly,  one is not


[06/30/2021 12:11 AM] Camellia#0001
that sounds like a rig problem rather than a pool problem


[06/30/2021 12:15 AM] Jason K#5020

[06/30/2021 12:16 AM] Jason K#5020
Yes, I'd agree, it's probably a rig problem.


[06/30/2021 12:16 AM] Jason K#5020
Any ideas where to start looking?


[06/30/2021 12:19 AM] Nythain#6769
Has that rig been offline at all when the other wasnt?


[06/30/2021 12:19 AM] Jason K#5020
Yes


[06/30/2021 12:20 AM] Nythain#6769
Well that will definitely skew the 6 and 24 hour averages. As for current, could just be some bad share luck.


[06/30/2021 12:21 AM] Jason K#5020
Consistently displaying a third of the hashrate for last 24 hours


[06/30/2021 12:23 AM] Nythain#6769
Its rather perplexing, wish i could help more but rig output looks good. And pools just calculate based primarily on share submission and some other factors.


[06/30/2021 12:23 AM] Jason K#5020
Would difficulty be at play?


[06/30/2021 12:24 AM] Jason K#5020
100% shares accepted


[06/30/2021 12:25 AM] Nythain#6769
Submission rate not acceptance % and i believe share difficulty is part of pool calculation but not 100% on that.


[06/30/2021 12:27 AM] Nythain#6769
Like if rig a only submitted 10 valid shares vs rig b 20, the pool would calculate rig a hashrate to be approximately half of b


[06/30/2021 12:28 AM] Nythain#6769
But it shouldnt be consistently 1/3 lol, which is why 24hr is usually pretty accurate.


[06/30/2021 12:28 AM] Jason K#5020

[06/30/2021 12:30 AM] Nythain#6769
That could be playing into the difference. Though it would only not rise to match the other if the pool thought it wasnt giving the same performance. Variable share diff is determined by worker performance.


[06/30/2021 12:31 AM] Jason K#5020
Would also affect worker hashrate display too right?


[06/30/2021 12:31 AM] Jason K#5020
This is like 60$ just disappearing lol


[06/30/2021 12:31 AM] Jason K#5020

Not sure. You could try asking hero, they are on this server and they have their own discord server.

[06/30/2021 12:34 AM] sol#4667
the reason is I registered in gate.io to keep my assets there, because before I had only wallet itself


[06/30/2021 12:35 AM] sol#4667
Awwww @Jason K can you provide strategy to change wallets without loosing much? I mean I still has to close 72 blocks before lock for the 73rd releases


[06/30/2021 12:36 AM] sol#4667
So best will be to wait for the next 1ERG to drop, then immidiately I abandon this address and switch it to new?


[06/30/2021 12:36 AM] Jason K#5020
I just mean, you might be telling the truth, but how would an admin know it belongs to you. A switch seems like a security breech


[06/30/2021 12:37 AM] sol#4667
If only they could do It. I can prove wallet is mine by simply transfering them the exact micro amount they'd request


[06/30/2021 12:38 AM] sol#4667
like 0.001337, you get me


[06/30/2021 12:38 AM] Jason K#5020
That's a good answer, good luck


[06/30/2021 12:39 AM] sol#4667
Thanks for the response anyway, glad we chatted


[06/30/2021 12:46 AM] Nythain#6769
Set your payout amount higher, then when you get over 1 erg, switch to mining new wallet address and once old wallet balance is all confirmed, set payout back to 1 so it sends entire balance. Then move those funds to new wallet.


[06/30/2021 12:53 AM] Nythain#6769
Its a lengthier solution but near lossless


[06/30/2021 12:53 AM] sol#4667
ok, so now it's set on 1ERG, I inrease it to 2?


[06/30/2021 12:55 AM] sol#4667
wait, do I need to mine through the same wallet address to cover those 72 blocks?


[06/30/2021 12:57 AM] Nythain#6769
No. Stop mining that wallet address when confirmed and unconfirmed total a little over 1 erg. Then switch to new wallet and mine with it. Once all old wallet is confirmed above 1 erg, set payout back to 1


[06/30/2021 12:59 AM] sol#4667
aaaaaaaaaa


[06/30/2021 12:59 AM] sol#4667
I finally got it


[06/30/2021 1:00 AM] Nythain#6769
So like set payout to 2 or 5 or whatevever. Then lets say confirmed is like .8 and awaiting or pending or unconfirmed or whatever its called on hero is like .3, you will stop mining that wallet address and start mining new wallet. Then when old wallet becomes 1.1 confirmed set payout back to 1 and it will send whole balance.


[06/30/2021 1:00 AM] sol#4667
It doesn't matter If I participate in mining these next 72 block, It's just I need to wait


[06/30/2021 1:00 AM] Nythain#6769
Yep


[06/30/2021 1:01 AM] sol#4667
Thank you sooo much @Nythain and @DenAce  for the help, much appreciate!


[06/30/2021 1:01 AM] Nythain#6769
You already got the reward for those blocks, just waiting on the confirmations for them to payout.


[06/30/2021 1:01 AM] sol#4667
fantastic strategy, thanks!


[06/30/2021 1:02 AM] sol#4667
mmhmm, got it

[06/30/2021 1:08 AM] andee#4722
@Jason K without miner output there is no way to verify anything. your miner could be resetting every minute for all we know


[06/30/2021 1:09 AM] sol#4667
And now it hit me why you were persistent on changing minimal payout, so I wouldn't lose that extra 0.050 from total 1.050 pending balance.


[06/30/2021 6:46 AM] gounry#2056
You will paid the total, event if it's 1.05 at the moment of the payout


[06/30/2021 6:59 PM] Camellia#0001
So I came across something weird‚Ä¶ I have an rx 480 that I scooped up for $100 listed as not working. However, I got it mining **but** only if it‚Äôs plugged into a full 16x slot‚Ä¶


[06/30/2021 6:59 PM] Camellia#0001
any potential reason for this?


[06/30/2021 7:41 PM] andee#4722
broken trace, broken riser, broken adapter, bad cable


[06/30/2021 7:44 PM] Camellia#0001
The riser works fine


[06/30/2021 7:44 PM] Camellia#0001
it has a different card in it


[06/30/2021 7:45 PM] andee#4722
then I would look at the pci-e traces, two cards I bought had been violently fitted and taken out, missing a lot of gold finish


[06/30/2021 7:46 PM] Camellia#0001
It‚Äôs mining perfectly fine in a 16x slot


[06/30/2021 7:47 PM] Camellia#0001
and it was listed as ‚Äúfor parts‚Äù so I guess it kinda is what it is lol


[06/30/2021 7:47 PM] andee#4722
then the lane that goes to the x1 adapter is probably toasted


[06/30/2021 7:48 PM] andee#4722
that buy was a win then üôÇ


[06/30/2021 7:49 PM] Camellia#0001
Yeah


[06/30/2021 7:49 PM] Camellia#0001

[06/30/2021 7:50 PM] Camellia#0001
also, even though this is probably the wrong place to ask, I‚Äôm trying to dual mine ethereum & ergo and 2 of my 3070s refuse to mine properly


[06/30/2021 7:51 PM] Camellia#0001
they just show up as n/a and not hashing at all


[06/30/2021 8:03 PM] andee#4722
its not possible to dual mine erg and eth


[06/30/2021 8:04 PM] andee#4722
unless you are talking about using 2 miners, and each has their own gpus


[06/30/2021 8:04 PM] andee#4722
which is not dual mining


[06/30/2021 8:04 PM] Camellia#0001
Not dual mining


[06/30/2021 8:04 PM] Camellia#0001
Just mining 2 coins


[06/30/2021 8:06 PM] andee#4722
have you chosen which gpu's the miners should use?


[06/30/2021 8:07 PM] Camellia#0001
Yes, I‚Äôm currently using a nominee for my 4 AMD cards for

*I know there are better miners for the AMD cards*


[06/30/2021 8:08 PM] andee#4722
and what miner are you using for the greens?


[06/30/2021 8:09 PM] Camellia#0001
Ethminer


[06/30/2021 8:09 PM] Camellia#0001
Been just trying anything to see if they work


[06/30/2021 8:12 PM] andee#4722
do you run it with `--cuda` ?


[06/30/2021 8:16 PM] Camellia#0001
Yeah


[06/30/2021 8:17 PM] andee#4722
and the gpu's work on nanominer?


[06/30/2021 8:18 PM] Camellia#0001
Totally fine


[06/30/2021 8:18 PM] Camellia#0001
now I got 1 showing up in ethmienr

And now giving only incorrect shares lol


[06/30/2021 8:23 PM] andee#4722
and you are certain the gpus is not used by nanominer?

@andee my bad. Didn‚Äôt see the node before. I‚Äôll move the convo there. Honestly I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs running or not


[06/30/2021 10:43 PM] andee#4722
@Pharotek use a multimeter to check how the power-on button turns it on


[06/30/2021 10:44 PM] andee#4722
if it grounds a pin that is pulled to +, then you use PS-ON + GND from the atx supply


[06/30/2021 10:46 PM] danandbeard#3509
oh that's smart


[06/30/2021 10:46 PM] andee#4722
if it is active high, then use whatever voltage is present (probably 5V) + GND


[06/30/2021 10:58 PM] andee#4722
if active high I would use a resistor in series just for extra comfort though. I don't think it provides any extra security if active low


[06/30/2021 11:30 PM] VoodooRush#4006

[07/01/2021 12:04 AM] andee#4722
my rig rebooted because of watchdog until it was in an infinite loop because the gpu never came back online. check cables, change riser and check power connector. maybe try stock settings if you see no problems


[07/01/2021 12:06 AM] andee#4722
strange that it came back for up to 2 hours at all, the basement reeked of burning plastic


[07/01/2021 12:11 AM] Licklobster#5542
i melted an 18ga splitter testing a vega on full power


[07/01/2021 12:11 AM] Licklobster#5542
turns out


[07/01/2021 12:11 AM] Licklobster#5542

guys how do the ergo mining pools work? Looking at the Node's code, there is basically a competitive environment for connected miners, they are competing for a block candidate to solve it ... so I suppose the pool is actually polling Node for the puzzle and splits the puzzle  between many miners ? I have a feeling that all the miners connected are solving the same puzzle, so it's just a big racing contest, nothing sophisticated


[07/01/2021 7:00 AM] Ancient Abysswalker#3546
I'm having some issues with setting up the precompiled AMD miner for Windows. I have the ERGO node running and up-to-date and set up the bat file for the miner, but when I run ErgoStratumProxy from the bat file and go to localhost:3000 it just says {"status": "fail"}. Is there some form of more verbose logging that can assist me in figuring out what part is failing?


[07/01/2021 2:28 PM] Pharotek#2932
really great idea, I will do do, if works i'll post here picture incase someone else wants to do it thanks!

think of mining puzzles as random number generators (RNG) for 1-10

think of difficulty as how many acceptable numbers in that range count as solutions
(e.g. a winning puzzle with difficulty 0 would be every solution works but difficult 1 only the number 10 is accepted)

mining pools make up a concept called "shares" shares are effectively useless, but they prove you're working towards real solutions, which is useful when deciding how to divvy up rewards

a pool may put difficulty at 0.6 for a share, while the blockchain requires a 0.9 for a solution

people solving the RNG will more often find 6, 7 or 8 than 9 or 10 - all of these numbers would count as shares, while only 9, 10 would be candidates to solve a real block, which earns rewards


[07/01/2021 7:39 PM] Leif Erickson#8939
Wow, great overview! Now I can actually explain this to my kids whose eyes typically glaze over about the time I say,"elliptical curve"

yo how tf do y'all change VDDC on linux for Vega


[07/01/2021 8:28 PM] Canberry#7404
i slightly lowered mem voltage and VDDC shot up 100mv and 50w higher power


[07/01/2021 8:34 PM] ziggomatic#9335

always s state 7, m state can go between 2 and 3


[07/01/2021 8:49 PM] ziggomatic#9335
so i am very new to this shit and haven't bothered with a mining os yet 'cause i tend to use the machine as a desktop still. anyways. i think you gotta piss around with p6 & p7, mem p 3, i used corectrl to disable some mem states, not sure that makes a damn bit of difference. rebooting between messing with them seems to help also


[07/01/2021 8:52 PM] Canberry#7404
yeah editing m 3 slightly made the VDDC jump


[07/01/2021 8:53 PM] Canberry#7404
im wondering if i need to edit s states 3-5


[07/01/2021 8:53 PM] Canberry#7404
but i dont see how that affects it if im at state 7


[07/01/2021 8:53 PM] ziggomatic#9335
yeah i've managed to ignore those i think


[07/01/2021 8:54 PM] ziggomatic#9335

[07/01/2021 8:54 PM] Canberry#7404
that weird jump was to 1050 then 1100


[07/01/2021 8:54 PM] Canberry#7404
hence me wondering about 3-5


[07/01/2021 9:05 PM] Canberry#7404
yeah that's not it


[07/01/2021 9:05 PM] Canberry#7404
still VDDC 1000 with all states under 1000


[07/01/2021 9:06 PM] andee#4722
that's how my 480's behave, they refuse to go under 1000mV


[07/01/2021 9:07 PM] Canberry#7404
is it entirely automatic?


[07/01/2021 9:07 PM] Canberry#7404
just annoying, tuning my card for lower power and VDDC increases to offset while having lower hashrate


[07/01/2021 9:07 PM] pragmaxim#0778
@danandbeard great to hear it is sophisticated and not just brute force ... ok, so from node's perspective, the mining pool acts as a regular miner, it just grabs a puzzle and returns solution


[07/01/2021 9:10 PM] andee#4722
@Canberry I haven't looked into it since they hash 69-70MH@120W, I think I was able to get them lower setting voltage for each DPM state but with the result of cards crashing after starting the miner


[07/01/2021 9:13 PM] Canberry#7404
that doesnt sound worth


[07/01/2021 9:13 PM] Canberry#7404

[07/01/2021 10:04 PM] danandbeard#3509
well I'm not sure what you mean exactly, but yeah pools try to divvy out work across some keyspace to prevent participants from solving the exact same puzzle - it's still bruteforce, just bruteforce with hopefully little to no overlapping work

ultimately, yes though, pools get the solutions from any worker and present that to the ledger as their own solution and put the block rewards into a pool of funds they distribute out to the participants

Hey everyone. I‚Äôve been having a nightmare of a time trying to get my 3060 mining properly. My 3060 is a KR version but it says it‚Äôs 2504 on device manager, so I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs a newer card that cannot have older driver 470.05 installed. 
I was directed here. Anyone have any insight on how to fix mine?


[07/02/2021 1:23 AM] andee#4722

Chrome stabilised mine for a while then after a few hours it dropped again. I also dropped power to minimum and that worked for a while. Playing a video on the 2nd screen worked for a while too


[07/02/2021 5:17 AM] shinyumbreon#2454
I can only do +187 mem


[07/02/2021 5:18 AM] shinyumbreon#2454
Any higher and it goes back down to 60 mh/s lol


[07/02/2021 5:18 AM] shinyumbreon#2454
I‚Äôm stable now at 105‚Ä¶

Anything specific you did?


[07/02/2021 5:49 AM] Licklobster#5542
you don't


[07/02/2021 5:49 AM] Licklobster#5542
you command the voltage and the clock and the wattage is the result


[07/02/2021 5:52 AM] Terremot#4855
It's odd. I changed which cuda cores are used in nvidia control panel and it didn't appear to work. I rebooted and it seems stable for now


[07/02/2021 6:07 AM] shinyumbreon#2454
Literally any memory higher than 187


[07/02/2021 6:07 AM] Terremot#4855
That's odd


[07/02/2021 6:07 AM] Terremot#4855

I undervolted


[07/02/2021 6:11 AM] shinyumbreon#2454
All of those lead to hashrate of 60 as soon as I implemented them


[07/02/2021 6:11 AM] shinyumbreon#2454

I‚Äôm not sure


[07/02/2021 6:58 AM] shinyumbreon#2454
I have the KR version according to EVGA not the KL (lhr)
But it says 2504
Maybe it‚Äôs a new non lhr?

So I see on evga website there is a 3655-KR and a 3657-KR

For the 3060


[07/02/2021 7:44 AM] shinyumbreon#2454
I guess it‚Äôs the black vs gaming version. The gaming has a higher memory clock. I wonder if there is a difference is mining

i have 2 msi ventus 3060 cards and 2 of gigabyte eagles
they all do 123-125 easily
but msi need -core while being very limited at mem oc
and gig's need +core and allow much higher mem clock
then the same at ethash
but at any cuckoo ver those msi's are 10+% faster than the gig's, no matter whatever oc adjustments be
all cards come from feb/march batches, well before the recent lhr kind

hi, i downloaded the wallet from ( https://ergowallet.io/ ) and im trying to figure out which address i am suppose to use for my mining address?

ERG
One wallet for whole Ergo.


[07/03/2021 12:06 AM] hwanzi#0721
bc there are like a ton of addresses


[07/03/2021 12:07 AM] hwanzi#0721
i downloaded the desktop version if that matters


[07/03/2021 12:26 AM] Nythain#6769
Whatever receiving address you have.

okay tyty @Nythain


[07/03/2021 1:57 AM] malincog#8689
I have a question! Why my miner use more cpu than the gpu? When i open the Task maker its says 30% cpu and 1%gpu


[07/03/2021 1:58 AM] malincog#8689
Im new in the mining thing, maybe it is a dumb question but if anyone can help me...


[07/03/2021 2:22 AM] arokace#8057
GPU usage won't necessarily show in Task Manager, or really anywhere.  GPU Usage is USUALLY a measure of your Core usuage and mining is usually pretty heavily focused on Memory (Not always but Ergo is certainly Memory dominant)

The CPU usage is probably just your OS and whatever programs you have going, GPU mining SHOULDN'T cause much cpu usage


[07/03/2021 2:24 AM] malincog#8689
so 20 to 40 cpu usage its ok?(in the task manager) √ß Or I did something wrong?


[07/03/2021 2:24 AM] arokace#8057
What CPU do you have?


[07/03/2021 2:26 AM] malincog#8689
amd ryzen 5 3500 6 core


[07/03/2021 2:28 AM] arokace#8057
Yea probably fine, but remember what I said, your CPU usage being that high probably has nothing to do with the miner.


[07/03/2021 2:28 AM] malincog#8689
ok, thanks


[07/03/2021 2:30 AM] arokace#8057
You know what I might have lied, Didn't realize the impact a miner can have on your CPU.  WIthout it runnign and I'm idle (not doing anything at the computer) I sit around 1-5%, with the miner running I sit around 8-15% (I'm on a 3800x, you're on a 3500, so your % being higher makes sense)


[07/03/2021 2:59 AM] malincog#8689
Ok


[07/03/2021 3:00 AM] malincog#8689
We need to install the NBMiner v38.1 if i have the

[07/03/2021 3:25 AM] arokace#8057
If I remember right, 38.1 said it fixed a high cpu usage.  I haven't updated to 38 yet and currently am testing out t-rex miner

Hey, I am facing some bios modding problems.
So I save the original bios than I open Polaris Bios Editor, open the original bios one time patching it and than saving it.
After this I open amdvbflashWin.exe, loading modded bios than program it. After this I reboot my PC.
Than I run atikmdag-patcher getting "driver successfully patched" and than the system reboots but when I go back to the device manager I get error code 3.
I am doing it with only 1 GPU.
I will be grateful if someone can help me 3 days in a row same thing.


[07/03/2021 5:03 PM] andee#4722
@T R A X E N are you certain you are using the latest patcher?

ver 1.4.10


[07/03/2021 5:05 PM] andee#4722

oh wait, hmm it appears to just be jumping for a moment and then settlign on expected numbers

it should settle where you command it

wouldnt recommend commanding the soc though


[07/04/2021 8:32 AM] Licklobster#5542
its largely tied to the core power state in the bios, and should be allowed to set itself

you in a hurry to not find a pool again?

I think all miners I have used has features for restarting both the miner and the computer. add a backup pool to the miner

[07/05/2021 7:24 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Do not use Molex or SATA for GPU/riser power *ever*.


[07/05/2021 7:24 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
That's how you start fires.


[07/05/2021 7:24 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
6 pin PCI-E is the safest and most stable way of doing things.


[07/05/2021 7:33 AM] pcfreak30#8526
im not? its  gpurisers + parallelminer


[07/05/2021 7:34 AM] AeonRemnant#3905

[07/05/2021 7:34 AM] pcfreak30#8526
im not using any molex or sata adapters on the risers. the molex/sata are for the mobo for power that it asks to put in for the pcie ports per the manual


[07/05/2021 7:34 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Right, those.


[07/05/2021 7:35 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Hmmmm. Lemme google.


[07/05/2021 7:36 AM] pcfreak30#8526
basically im running down every lead i can find atm. ive disabled csm (from hive), using gen2 (from hive), found theres an unreleased beta bios driver (from hive). uipdating to a beta amd driver. past 5 gpu's, it goes to hell. only etc runs stable.


[07/05/2021 7:36 AM] pcfreak30#8526
using mmpos


[07/05/2021 7:36 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Right, I have a 12 card rig working fine, my method is simply adapting 1x to 16x and powering everything via 6 pin cables off breakout boards. My main problem pushing so many cards was the BIOS itself.


[07/05/2021 7:37 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Can confirm I wasn't able to make it work through Hive, had to actually do it via BIOS.


[07/05/2021 7:37 AM] pcfreak30#8526
yea i cant even get 6 cards running on raven or ergo


[07/05/2021 7:37 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Weird.


[07/05/2021 7:37 AM] pcfreak30#8526
it doesnt matter the port, or the card i use


[07/05/2021 7:37 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
What's the behavior the cards show?


[07/05/2021 7:37 AM] pcfreak30#8526
im not a novice. im a dev/tech/other things


[07/05/2021 7:37 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Indeed, but what're they actually doing?


[07/05/2021 7:38 AM] pcfreak30#8526
so im used to the riodeo. i wasted a month on asus b250 and i wont even use my spares


[07/05/2021 7:38 AM] pcfreak30#8526
this is a new rig


[07/05/2021 7:38 AM] pcfreak30#8526
so i have nothing to compare on


[07/05/2021 7:38 AM] pcfreak30#8526
its amd power play tables failing in the driber


[07/05/2021 7:38 AM] pcfreak30#8526
per dmesg


[07/05/2021 7:39 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
5 AMD cards and an H110, yes. Hmmmm. 
The board should work fine, and the GPUs just aren't. What's the max cards that *do* work?


[07/05/2021 7:39 AM] pcfreak30#8526
it runs for no morte than 5 min, then dies


[07/05/2021 7:39 AM] pcfreak30#8526
no bioes mods, no oc settings


[07/05/2021 7:39 AM] pcfreak30#8526
mix of 470, 480, 580 4g


[07/05/2021 7:39 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
And how many cards can be in stable?


[07/05/2021 7:39 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
4?


[07/05/2021 7:39 AM] pcfreak30#8526
as i said max is 5


[07/05/2021 7:40 AM] pcfreak30#8526
ive tested then each one at a time, diff ports, then added them up with a cxold boot per change


[07/05/2021 7:40 AM] pcfreak30#8526
even put a 6th at the end for the hell of it and found a trouble port i skipped.


[07/05/2021 7:40 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Odd.


[07/05/2021 7:41 AM] pcfreak30#8526
its annoying b/c i have a LOT of cards coming in and this is a huge roadblock limiting me to 1 algo


[07/05/2021 7:41 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
CSM off, link speed gen 2, 4G encoding enabled.


[07/05/2021 7:41 AM] pcfreak30#8526
i have a lot invested buz wsise


[07/05/2021 7:41 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Add one at a time and mine for 2 minutes between boots.


[07/05/2021 7:41 AM] pcfreak30#8526
4G is enabled default i think


[07/05/2021 7:41 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Did you check?


[07/05/2021 7:41 AM] pcfreak30#8526
yea i do more than 2 min


[07/05/2021 7:41 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Some boards can be amazingly stupid.


[07/05/2021 7:42 AM] pcfreak30#8526
but thats basically what i tested


[07/05/2021 7:42 AM] pcfreak30#8526
and i bought 4 of these


[07/05/2021 7:42 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Ouch.


[07/05/2021 7:42 AM] pcfreak30#8526
trusting asrock wouldnt fuick me as they never have


[07/05/2021 7:42 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
I mean, if you want something that does work, MSI B360-F Pros.


[07/05/2021 7:42 AM] pcfreak30#8526
i have always had good exp with asrock


[07/05/2021 7:42 AM] pcfreak30#8526
asus wasted a month of my work time


[07/05/2021 7:42 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
I know those work with 12 cards, Nvidia or AMD.


[07/05/2021 7:43 AM] pcfreak30#8526
sigh ppl are scalping


[07/05/2021 7:43 AM] pcfreak30#8526
i got these at ~200 each


[07/05/2021 7:43 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
*rolls eyes* People scalp TPM modules now.


[07/05/2021 7:43 AM] pcfreak30#8526
so 800-900 vs 2k


[07/05/2021 7:43 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
There's no limit.


[07/05/2021 7:44 AM] pcfreak30#8526
i mean , whileb i can increase my rig count, that doubles expenses stupiudly


[07/05/2021 7:44 AM] pcfreak30#8526
rofl


[07/05/2021 7:45 AM] pcfreak30#8526
sigh, amd driver chafge did jack shit


[07/05/2021 7:45 AM] pcfreak30#8526
`failed to send message 171 ret is 65535 `


[07/05/2021 7:45 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
That's true, but all of my B360-Fs have worked flawlessly.


[07/05/2021 7:45 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
All I can say is they behave weirdly, but very predictably.


[07/05/2021 7:45 AM] pcfreak30#8526
i atleast know its not b/c some are itx minis


[07/05/2021 7:46 AM] pcfreak30#8526
i was concerned bulk buying that they would give issues


[07/05/2021 7:46 AM] pcfreak30#8526
i also have more risers i can try (boiught multipler orders)


[07/05/2021 7:46 AM] pcfreak30#8526
but my gut tells me risers arent the issue


[07/05/2021 7:47 AM] pcfreak30#8526
b/c it works in one ago but not others. i practically have an asic rig


[07/05/2021 7:48 AM] pcfreak30#8526
testing out vtc and seeing if it fails


[07/05/2021 7:48 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
It won't be the risers, GPUs, or board.


[07/05/2021 7:48 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Gotta be a config problem.


[07/05/2021 7:48 AM] pcfreak30#8526
well it crashes in 5 min on stock settings. you tell me üòÑ


[07/05/2021 7:49 AM] pcfreak30#8526
not sure ive heard of any gpu doing that. it also doesnt crash on ergo with less than 6 cards


[07/05/2021 7:49 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
No OC settings, you said?


[07/05/2021 7:49 AM] pcfreak30#8526
correct


[07/05/2021 7:49 AM] pcfreak30#8526
thats why im stumped


[07/05/2021 7:49 AM] pcfreak30#8526
ive been in the 2017 run, and ive roied from start of 2021 and am expanding. so not new to this


[07/05/2021 7:50 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Logically I'd have to say check with a new version of Hive for sanity checking.


[07/05/2021 7:50 AM] pcfreak30#8526
im on mmpos.


[07/05/2021 7:51 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Ah.


[07/05/2021 7:51 AM] pcfreak30#8526
im considering hive just to cross compare. but they all likrely use similar kernel configs


[07/05/2021 7:51 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Defo try Hive.


[07/05/2021 7:51 AM] pcfreak30#8526
in general i look at any advice from any distro as its all ubuntu 18.04


[07/05/2021 7:51 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
I know for a fact Hive works with 12 card configs on both Nvidia/AMD as stock, no mods for anything required.


[07/05/2021 7:51 AM] pcfreak30#8526
im a sys admin as well so im not ignoring any pointer


[07/05/2021 7:52 AM] pcfreak30#8526
yea mmpos has worked well and uses all custom code


[07/05/2021 7:52 AM] pcfreak30#8526
but the lack of bulk management or api REALLY limits them


[07/05/2021 7:52 AM] pcfreak30#8526
even if they perform


[07/05/2021 7:52 AM] pcfreak30#8526
ok.. vert hasnt crashed yet


[07/05/2021 7:53 AM] pcfreak30#8526
so eth and vtc work, ergo and rvn dont?


[07/05/2021 7:53 AM] pcfreak30#8526
-_-


[07/05/2021 7:53 AM] pcfreak30#8526
Question is, what are the algo differences b/c I know this cant just be isolated to me


[07/05/2021 7:54 AM] pcfreak30#8526
Ive already beat 90% of the bs hardware problems ive read


[07/05/2021 7:58 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
It‚Äôs weird. Give Hive a try, isolate the OS as a problem as well.


[07/05/2021 8:04 AM] pcfreak30#8526
switched to lolminer, crashed.


[07/05/2021 8:04 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Yeeh.


[07/05/2021 8:04 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
I'd just boot to Hive and see if that has the same issue.


[07/05/2021 8:04 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
If it does we know it's probably BIOS.


[07/05/2021 8:05 AM] pcfreak30#8526
bout to buy a TB250-BTC+ for the hell of it on an auction


[07/05/2021 8:05 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Just...


[07/05/2021 8:05 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
If you're buying new boards just get a B360-F.


[07/05/2021 8:05 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Can confirm it works fine.


[07/05/2021 8:05 AM] Muessig#0272
so what would be going wrong my end if I'm getting invalid shares?


[07/05/2021 8:05 AM] Muessig#0272
or some


[07/05/2021 8:05 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
@Muessig Idk, depends on your setup.


[07/05/2021 8:06 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Need to know it.


[07/05/2021 8:06 AM] Muessig#0272

[07/05/2021 8:06 AM] pcfreak30#8526
i have a spreadsheet for ebay to compute real price


[07/05/2021 8:06 AM] pcfreak30#8526
found it would be higher than from somedone selling with free shipping


[07/05/2021 8:06 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Yep, that's scalping for you.


[07/05/2021 8:07 AM] pcfreak30#8526
no.


[07/05/2021 8:07 AM] pcfreak30#8526
its my states sales tax


[07/05/2021 8:07 AM] Muessig#0272
It's errors its saying duplicate share


[07/05/2021 8:07 AM] pcfreak30#8526
they xharge tax on shipping so i have to compute the final price


[07/05/2021 8:07 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
@Muessig Where are you and where is the rig trying to mine to? Sounds like possible latency issues.


[07/05/2021 8:07 AM] pcfreak30#8526
(price + shipping) * 7%


[07/05/2021 8:07 AM] pcfreak30#8526
:/


[07/05/2021 8:07 AM] Muessig#0272
UK, mining to herominers in germany


[07/05/2021 8:07 AM] Muessig#0272
latency 42ms


[07/05/2021 8:08 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
*shrugs* Worth biting the bullet.


[07/05/2021 8:08 AM] pcfreak30#8526
umm there not a uyk location


[07/05/2021 8:08 AM] pcfreak30#8526
uk is pretty big for DC locations.


[07/05/2021 8:08 AM] pcfreak30#8526
most should have an eu/uk


[07/05/2021 8:08 AM] pcfreak30#8526
or eu and de


[07/05/2021 8:08 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
^ Have a switch of the pool to one closer.


[07/05/2021 8:08 AM] Muessig#0272
im using the address in the eu


[07/05/2021 8:09 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Also which miner are you using?


[07/05/2021 8:09 AM] Muessig#0272
the one that's closest to me


[07/05/2021 8:09 AM] Muessig#0272
nbminer


[07/05/2021 8:09 AM] pcfreak30#8526
or just run a poing test on them all


[07/05/2021 8:09 AM] pcfreak30#8526
pick the lowest ping


[07/05/2021 8:09 AM] pcfreak30#8526
sometimes a farther geo place ies faster due to how isps route shit


[07/05/2021 8:09 AM] pcfreak30#8526
weird but true


[07/05/2021 8:10 AM] pcfreak30#8526
ping is what matters


[07/05/2021 8:10 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Ping doesn't need to be amazingly low. I'm in Aus and have to mine US West pools sometimes, they all work fine and give me expected profits so long as the ping is under like 200.


[07/05/2021 8:10 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Remember, Aus has 150 minimum pings to damn near everywhere else. :P


[07/05/2021 8:12 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
With that said the performance tends to be *better* with less ping, but ping won't break everything.


[07/05/2021 8:12 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
@Muessig And what's your rejected ratio?


[07/05/2021 8:12 AM] Muessig#0272
46Kaccepted, 92 stale, 317 invalid


[07/05/2021 8:13 AM] Muessig#0272
Up until last week I had zero invalid


[07/05/2021 8:13 AM] Muessig#0272
I'm trying to figure out what's changed that  means its suddenly getting duplicate shares


[07/05/2021 8:13 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Could try t-rex or nanominer for sanity checking.


[07/05/2021 8:24 AM] pcfreak30#8526
@AeonRemnant switched to 5 cards, no crashes yet :/


[07/05/2021 8:25 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
What'd you switch?


[07/05/2021 8:25 AM] pcfreak30#8526
i unpugged the card at the end i added


[07/05/2021 8:25 AM] pcfreak30#8526
5 cards is the limit that works


[07/05/2021 8:25 AM] pcfreak30#8526
they can be hooked in everywhere, i just remove from pcie


[07/05/2021 8:26 AM] Camellia#0001
Invalid shares on nvidia cards are usually due to OCing the cards before the DAG is generated


[07/05/2021 8:26 AM] Muessig#0272
It's the same OC I've been using before but maybe I'll dial it down a touch


[07/05/2021 8:26 AM] Camellia#0001
no


[07/05/2021 8:26 AM] Camellia#0001
start your miner, let the dag generate


[07/05/2021 8:26 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Add an OC delay.


[07/05/2021 8:26 AM] Camellia#0001
^


[07/05/2021 8:26 AM] Muessig#0272
Oh i see


[07/05/2021 8:26 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
20 seconds or so is what I use. 12x 3070 on nbminer.


[07/05/2021 8:27 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
4.3k shares, 4 invalid.


[07/05/2021 8:27 AM] Camellia#0001
Its not a massive sample size but I never get invalid shares on these 3070s after

Makes sense if I've just applied the OC too early


[07/05/2021 8:27 AM] Camellia#0001
How do you do this in hiveos btw


[07/05/2021 8:27 AM] Camellia#0001
I just manually do it since I only have 3 3070s

so I quit nbminer, removed the OC and still on stock get 2 duplicate shares before I even apply the oc

Adjust individual cards after fully stable.

@Muessig Try using t-rex miner.

[07/05/2021 9:18 AM] pcfreak30#8526
somehow hive hasnt crashed yet.


[07/05/2021 9:18 AM] pcfreak30#8526
@AeonRemnant


[07/05/2021 9:18 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
With how many?


[07/05/2021 9:19 AM] pcfreak30#8526
which on one hand im happy i dont need a new mobo, on the other im going wtfh is going on here


[07/05/2021 9:19 AM] pcfreak30#8526
6 cards. its 4:30 so i really need to sleep üòÑ


[07/05/2021 9:19 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Yep, that's why we use Hive. :P


[07/05/2021 9:19 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Welcome in.


[07/05/2021 9:19 AM] pcfreak30#8526
i used mmpos b/c hive gave me issues before on perfortmance


[07/05/2021 9:20 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Really? It's been nothing but beautifully flawless for me.


[07/05/2021 9:20 AM] pcfreak30#8526
i did a week+ dig on all mahor oses and reversed them and saw who stunk and who had good code and how they did it


[07/05/2021 9:20 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Ah.


[07/05/2021 9:21 AM] pcfreak30#8526
mmpos uses custom c++ code for everything. they dont use open source tooling. they devs know their shit but they dont really scale for large management. if you mixed mmpos and hive it would be the perfect platform


[07/05/2021 9:21 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Ah yeah.


[07/05/2021 9:21 AM] pcfreak30#8526
hive aims for large farms ans stability


[07/05/2021 9:21 AM] pcfreak30#8526
but not always the max hash


[07/05/2021 9:22 AM] pcfreak30#8526
then you have smaller platforms and shitty ones


[07/05/2021 9:22 AM] pcfreak30#8526
minerstat os is dog crap node code and nice hash is well nicehash.


[07/05/2021 9:22 AM] pcfreak30#8526
those are like the godaddy (if you know who that is) for mining

didnt use it much, dont remermber why but saw they were revamping


[07/05/2021 9:24 AM] pcfreak30#8526
for mer, scale and an API is almost a deal breaker


[07/05/2021 9:24 AM] pcfreak30#8526
So i understand why farms use hive


[07/05/2021 9:24 AM] pcfreak30#8526
for some reason mmpos doesnt prioritize that or pxe boot


[07/05/2021 9:24 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Weird.


[07/05/2021 9:24 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Say, have you ever used Swarm for Hive?


[07/05/2021 9:25 AM] pcfreak30#8526
they could easily beat hive if they tried, but a core dev has never even used hive but speaks positive on raven os, which i think is shit


[07/05/2021 9:26 AM] pcfreak30#8526
and the only reason i dont make an os is i know it would be more effort than being a miner. not interested in getting into that competitive space


[07/05/2021 9:26 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
:LUL:


[07/05/2021 9:26 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Make Hive but faster and they'll flock to you.


[07/05/2021 9:26 AM] pcfreak30#8526
its like hosting, thin margins, high expectations and more upfront work


[07/05/2021 9:27 AM] pcfreak30#8526
my goal is to be financially free, not be tech support for nicehash pools


[07/05/2021 9:27 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
:LUL:


[07/05/2021 9:27 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Yeah, that's fair.


[07/05/2021 9:28 AM] pcfreak30#8526
i know b/c i used to do commercial hosting and game hosting


[07/05/2021 9:28 AM] pcfreak30#8526
So i have a lot of server background in general


[07/05/2021 9:28 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Same.


[07/05/2021 9:28 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Game hosting is especially awful.


[07/05/2021 9:29 AM] pcfreak30#8526
for me it was minecraft/java üòÑ


[07/05/2021 9:29 AM] pcfreak30#8526
try running 50+ instances of java on intel cpus


[07/05/2021 9:29 AM] pcfreak30#8526
with all the modpacks that exist


[07/05/2021 9:29 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
:KEKW:


[07/05/2021 9:29 AM] pcfreak30#8526
over openvz


[07/05/2021 9:29 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
That's tormented.


[07/05/2021 9:30 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
I was doing minecraft on way smaller machines.


[07/05/2021 9:30 AM] pcfreak30#8526
but i learned a lot more than i wanted to about buggy virtualization, ipmi, and kvm systems


[07/05/2021 9:30 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
I could almost smell the SQL and Java problems looming in the distance.


[07/05/2021 9:31 AM] pcfreak30#8526
upside is i know more sys admin and devops that i ever would otherwise


[07/05/2021 9:31 AM] pcfreak30#8526
Which means mining on the it side is simple


[07/05/2021 9:31 AM] pcfreak30#8526
when the hardware behaves...


[07/05/2021 9:31 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Lmao


[07/05/2021 9:32 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
I've always been heavily into the hardware side of things.


[07/05/2021 9:32 AM] pcfreak30#8526
I was using puppet to operates 19 boxes in 3 dc's


[07/05/2021 9:32 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Not proxmox?


[07/05/2021 9:32 AM] pcfreak30#8526
and that was years ago


[07/05/2021 9:33 AM] pcfreak30#8526
no. was solusvm. basically nitche where your limited in the software integrations so you have to use what you can get even if its trash


[07/05/2021 9:33 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Proxmox is absolutely delicious for minecraft servers.


[07/05/2021 9:33 AM] pcfreak30#8526
the only ones who cxan use proxmox are the ones who can hire a dev team to build integration or a panel around the API's


[07/05/2021 9:34 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Being able to roll one version of major programs like java and SQL and having copy pasted containers just accept it...


[07/05/2021 9:34 AM] pcfreak30#8526
b/c unless you buy support,  the dics are shit and you would prob be reverse engineering perl code


[07/05/2021 9:34 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
It makes rolling out mass updates just so much easier.


[07/05/2021 9:35 AM] pcfreak30#8526
Basically im glad im not in the hosting sector anymore, but im happy for the exp it helps me with


[07/05/2021 9:35 AM] pcfreak30#8526
I will run a DC with me as the customer, so only 3 am call is my system monitors üòÑ

the case fans are off


[07/05/2021 9:37 AM] pcfreak30#8526
but i atleast had it running and crashing for something else


[07/05/2021 9:38 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Could change BIOS to just ignore fans and set them all to max.


[07/05/2021 9:38 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
See if that doe something.


[07/05/2021 9:39 AM] pcfreak30#8526
fans are connected via molex to psu


[07/05/2021 9:39 AM] pcfreak30#8526
not mobo


[07/05/2021 9:39 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Ah.


[07/05/2021 9:39 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Right, uhh.


[07/05/2021 9:39 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Risers are all ok?


[07/05/2021 9:40 AM] pcfreak30#8526
now that i have progress i can reconfigure those again. i have limited molex/sata connectors and had to test the mobos power wuith its 2x molex, 1x sata.


[07/05/2021 9:40 AM] pcfreak30#8526
need extension, splitter for them all i think


[07/05/2021 9:41 AM] pcfreak30#8526
i have a shit $20-40 psu for mobo


[07/05/2021 9:41 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
O_O


[07/05/2021 9:41 AM] pcfreak30#8526
risers are gpurisers.com


[07/05/2021 9:41 AM] pcfreak30#8526
d/w, the cards are on parallelminer 1500w

[07/05/2021 9:41 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
I went with ubit risers and a 550W PSU for the mobo and 2 1200W HP PSUs.


[07/05/2021 9:42 AM] pcfreak30#8526
i just need a cheap route to kickstart things


[07/05/2021 9:42 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Not ever taking chances with power supplies ever again.


[07/05/2021 9:42 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
NEVER again.


[07/05/2021 9:42 AM] pcfreak30#8526
i got stupid today and blew a psu


[07/05/2021 9:42 AM] pcfreak30#8526

Lmao


[07/05/2021 9:43 AM] pcfreak30#8526

God no.


[07/05/2021 9:44 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
I'd cut my thumbs off before putting *that* near 20 grand of stuff.


[07/05/2021 9:44 AM] pcfreak30#8526
i havent gotten that far yet


[07/05/2021 9:44 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Silverstone has the sheer rep that makes me comfortable with putting it near expensive things.


[07/05/2021 9:44 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Silverstone and EVGA.


[07/05/2021 9:45 AM] pcfreak30#8526
but i wouoldnt trust that for the actual cards


[07/05/2021 9:45 AM] pcfreak30#8526
if that blew the rig, cpu, and ram, i would be out $300 prob


[07/05/2021 9:45 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Mm.


[07/05/2021 9:45 AM] pcfreak30#8526
But better that than the 8x $200 per cards


[07/05/2021 9:46 AM] pcfreak30#8526
I got a lot of them and i have a LOT of them at the post office


[07/05/2021 9:46 AM] pcfreak30#8526
cant pick em up due to holiday :/


[07/05/2021 9:46 AM] pcfreak30#8526
So heavy expanding


[07/05/2021 9:46 AM] pcfreak30#8526
om 4gb cards for the  next bull run


[07/05/2021 9:47 AM] pcfreak30#8526
b/c everything else price per hash is someone on drugs


[07/05/2021 9:47 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
I'm going 3070s at the moment since I can get them for halfway reasonable price.


[07/05/2021 9:47 AM] pcfreak30#8526
I was able to get 580 8gb for sub 200 in jan, and vegas sub 300.


[07/05/2021 9:48 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Impressive.


[07/05/2021 9:48 AM] pcfreak30#8526
My next targets honestly when I can afford the premium is VII and more vegas


[07/05/2021 9:48 AM] pcfreak30#8526
I WANT vii badly, but 2-3 vegas can beat on price


[07/05/2021 9:49 AM] pcfreak30#8526
But if i can get a rig of VII, will be a huge boost


[07/05/2021 9:49 AM] pcfreak30#8526
but expensive


[07/05/2021 9:50 AM] pcfreak30#8526
So atm getting a ton of 470, 570 and 580 4g old cards


[07/05/2021 9:50 AM] pcfreak30#8526
That will work for 1-3 years on many algos


[07/05/2021 9:50 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
ROI?


[07/05/2021 9:51 AM] pcfreak30#8526
and going from there. already got vegas , 580 8g,  5600xt, and a 1080ti i bought long ago


[07/05/2021 9:51 AM] pcfreak30#8526
I roied in 4-5 months.


[07/05/2021 9:51 AM] pcfreak30#8526
So looking at the sane of 6 moths


[07/05/2021 9:51 AM] pcfreak30#8526
Which is why im doing as much as I can b/c shits bout to happen


[07/05/2021 9:51 AM] pcfreak30#8526
with 1-2 months i think


[07/05/2021 9:52 AM] pcfreak30#8526
So I got ton get operational with all rigs, and cooling sorted


[07/05/2021 9:52 AM] pcfreak30#8526
i say all b/c im restructing my 2 rigs i got and possibly selling the cases


[07/05/2021 9:52 AM] pcfreak30#8526
12 gpu cases have not done well on cooling i think


[07/05/2021 9:53 AM] pcfreak30#8526
So considering putting them in open air and flipping the cases


[07/05/2021 9:54 AM] pcfreak30#8526
Was mineshop cases, and thought it was a good idea, but I really overpaid at 900 each.


[07/05/2021 9:54 AM] pcfreak30#8526
now i see others trying to sell similar at 1k+


[07/05/2021 9:54 AM] pcfreak30#8526
parallel mining is what im doing different this time though


[07/05/2021 10:31 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Open air is by far the best way.


[07/05/2021 10:31 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
The only real reason to use cases is when you *need* fast and direct flow for massive data centers.


[07/05/2021 12:00 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
I like the idea of server case with shroud and fans removed from GPUs. Assuming the heatsink is the right direction/style.


[07/05/2021 6:15 PM] danandbeard#3509
I'm slowly raising the memclk to see what I can get out of this vega 56 and some values make the cards hashrate do an expected growth followed by slowly growing in hashrate until it crashes...what causes that behavior?


[07/05/2021 6:53 PM] vvicky#6954
hi
i am facing a problem
my hash rate are not stable
on erg
its quite stable on eth


[07/05/2021 6:53 PM] andee#4722
that's normal for the algo


[07/05/2021 6:54 PM] andee#4722
hashrate drops on every dataset creation


[07/05/2021 6:55 PM] vvicky#6954
ok


[07/05/2021 6:55 PM] vvicky#6954
i am using vega56 and vega64


[07/05/2021 6:55 PM] vvicky#6954
its giving 160mhs per card


[07/05/2021 6:56 PM] vvicky#6954
and some time its droping to 145mhs


[07/05/2021 6:56 PM] vvicky#6954
its continously doing like this


[07/05/2021 6:56 PM] vvicky#6954
up and down


[07/05/2021 6:56 PM] vvicky#6954
le me share a graph of these hash rate


[07/05/2021 6:56 PM] danandbeard#3509
yes, that's normal

ow i c


[07/05/2021 6:57 PM] danandbeard#3509
every block mined builds a new graph - so you can expect to build a new graph (which will temporarily drop your hash) every 120s on average...in reality new blocks are found much higher or lower than 120s, though


[07/05/2021 6:57 PM] vvicky#6954
i was thinking may be it was the problem of my cards


[07/05/2021 6:58 PM] vvicky#6954
ow i c


[07/05/2021 6:58 PM] vvicky#6954
thanks a lot


[07/05/2021 6:58 PM] vvicky#6954
do u know good setting for vega series? i am using vega56 and vega64


[07/05/2021 6:59 PM] danandbeard#3509
I'm new to mining myself, there are a few people that have a lot of vega knowledge around occasionally though so maybe they're around or you can drop back by and catch them some other time


[07/05/2021 6:59 PM] danandbeard#3509
vegas with perfect settings can do 200+ but I've only managed that with 1/4 of my cards currently


[07/05/2021 7:06 PM] vvicky#6954
ok


[07/05/2021 7:07 PM] andee#4722
if you search for vega on the server you will find a ton of knowledge and settings


[07/05/2021 7:10 PM] vvicky#6954
on which server?\


[07/05/2021 7:12 PM] danandbeard#3509
this one, there will be a lot of noise, but if you read through chat history here and in #‚õè‚îÇmining you'll find a lot of vega knowledge


[07/05/2021 7:14 PM] andee#4722
@vvicky


[07/05/2021 7:14 PM] andee#4722
ok that didn't work..

just scroll a little up in this channel, there are vega settings, timings and even the bios on the cards

@Alien Œ£ Crypto use WALLET.WORKERNAME/FAKE@MAIL.COM but you need high enough worker rating for it to be able to edit payout


[07/05/2021 9:34 PM] Terremot#4855
play a video on the display of the affecting card, on loop


[07/05/2021 9:35 PM] andee#4722
that's a LHR bypass though. I think the problems come from the hashrate dropping every block, which is normal


[07/05/2021 9:36 PM] Terremot#4855
oh, hashrate is variable on every coin


[07/05/2021 9:36 PM] Terremot#4855
is never 100% stable


[07/05/2021 10:02 PM] Alien Œ£ Crypto#4489
It's the card I took out showing as an available so it's not working. Need to put it back but I'm enjoying my game too much atm even though I'm missing 167mh


[07/05/2021 10:09 PM] andee#4722
change worker name to the one with the highest rating, or just keep mining and after x amount of hours it will work as long as you added `/fake@mail.com` behind workername

Hello there, I'm a newcomer to all things ergo. I want to create an ergo wallet (desktop) and mine to it


[07/06/2021 6:33 AM] Stef#0241
I've seen the video explaining how to set up the wallet


[07/06/2021 6:33 AM] Stef#0241
And I've seen videos about how to mine


[07/06/2021 6:33 AM] Stef#0241
But none of them mine to the desktop wallet


[07/06/2021 6:33 AM] Stef#0241
And I've seen a guy on the forums that said his desktop wallet balance always remained zero even though he was mining on it


[07/06/2021 6:34 AM] Stef#0241
So If someone has a link to a proper guide for this I'll be glad

[07/06/2021 7:00 AM] Stef#0241
So, do I have to just change mining = false to mining = true in the config to make it compatible with mining?


[07/06/2021 7:00 AM] Stef#0241
My problem is not setting the wallet itself, but being able to mine to it


[07/06/2021 7:00 AM] andee#4722
are you going to solo mine?


[07/06/2021 7:01 AM] Stef#0241
Using a pool is better right?


[07/06/2021 7:01 AM] andee#4722
unless you have a ton of hashrate, yeah


[07/06/2021 7:01 AM] Stef#0241
Yep I have a single 3060


[07/06/2021 7:01 AM] andee#4722
then mining = false


[07/06/2021 7:03 AM] Stef#0241
So it will work this way?


[07/06/2021 7:03 AM] andee#4722
you only need an address for mining on a pool, I mine to yoroi as its easier to use


[07/06/2021 7:03 AM] Stef#0241
üëç


[07/06/2021 7:04 AM] andee#4722
good luck and please don't mine on nanopool as they have 60% of the hashrate


[07/06/2021 7:04 AM] Stef#0241
Yes I saw that too


[07/06/2021 7:06 AM] Stef#0241
Also, any recommendations on mining software to use?


[07/06/2021 7:06 AM] Stef#0241
I was using t-rex for eth and they have recently added support for ergo aswell


[07/06/2021 7:08 AM] andee#4722
since you are already using t-rex I would just try that, nbminer may have a little more speed but I doubt that will last long


[07/06/2021 7:36 AM] Stef#0241
üëç


[07/06/2021 7:36 AM] Stef#0241
Another question, do I have to run Windows powershell connected to my wallet all the time to have it work?


[07/06/2021 7:38 AM] andee#4722
the coins are stored on the blockchain, you only need to run the node to send erg, create a nft etc


[07/06/2021 7:39 AM] andee#4722
I recommend syncing every once in a while though so it doesn't take an hour before you are able to transact


[07/06/2021 7:40 AM] Stef#0241
Roger that


[07/06/2021 7:40 AM] Stef#0241
What does syncing practically do to my ergo folder though?


[07/06/2021 7:40 AM] Stef#0241
Like does it take up progressively more space


[07/06/2021 7:43 AM] andee#4722
it syncs the blockchain, I see my folder is ~5.6GB


[07/06/2021 7:43 AM] andee#4722
full node wallets keep a full copy of the blockchain on the computer


[07/06/2021 7:48 AM] Stef#0241
Ok I understand, thanks

Hi, I‚Äôm currently using a 3060Ti LHR. I can‚Äôt seem to get a hash rate beyond 90MH/s even after OC. What should I take note about?


[07/06/2021 4:51 PM] Licklobster#5542
your lhr card is producing lhr?


[07/06/2021 4:51 PM] Licklobster#5542
:Pepe_clown:


[07/06/2021 4:52 PM] JJx#4085
Hahahah, cause I thought LHR should only affect ETH and ETC, and not Ergo?


[07/06/2021 4:52 PM] Licklobster#5542
nope


[07/06/2021 4:53 PM] JJx#4085

I second wooly. Specially if 24/7 mining.


[07/07/2021 3:33 AM] arokace#8057
I've got to ask since someone on reddit are saying this.  Is your driver up to date. Supposedly nVidia fixed the issue with a driver update... At least that's what this person on reddit is saying.  I hope they're right but I honestly don't believe they are and are probably doing something else without realizing it.


[07/07/2021 3:36 AM] JJx#4085
I have used the latest driver at first then I switched to 466.77 but both didn‚Äôt help with the hashrate. I‚Äôll just switch to mining other coins while waiting for a possible fix hah (octopus algo doesn‚Äôt seem to be affected)


[07/07/2021 3:38 AM] arokace#8057
Cfx is definitely one of the very few left unaffected for sure.

And thank you.  I figured it wouldn't have worked but had to ask.  This LHR shot is really fucking weird from what I've gathered. It's effectiveness and how to maybe get around it is different with a lot of cards.  Besides the YouTube trick but you usually don't want YouTube running on your mining rig lol.


[07/07/2021 3:41 AM] JJx#4085
No worries, thanks for the help! Doesn‚Äôt really matter to me which coin also since I‚Äôm just mining for fun hahah


[07/07/2021 3:44 AM] arokace#8057
Best I can say, is mess with all aspects of the OC a bunch, including the curve. One thing that I have only heard once but has kind of stuck with me because I haven't heard anyone say otherwise.  Is the the "lhr" might be tied to which step of your core frequency you're at.  Said something for its every other step.


[07/07/2021 3:53 PM] danandbeard#2312
anyone here got a vega 56 nitro+ with hynix?


[07/07/2021 3:54 PM] danandbeard#2312
been tweaking it for days now and can't seem to get a stable strap/oc to go beyond 179 mh/s


[07/07/2021 3:55 PM] danandbeard#2312
also, does the bios switch matter for nitro+  I don't notice a difference when I switch it either way, I just assume amdmemtweak is overriding whatever bios is trying to set anyways


[07/07/2021 4:59 PM] Licklobster#5542
shouldnt


[07/07/2021 4:59 PM] Licklobster#5542
what are you setting it to


[07/07/2021 4:59 PM] Licklobster#5542
1400/890 should net 185ish


[07/07/2021 5:03 PM] danandbeard#2312
I've tried a _lot_ of things the typical `amdmemtweak --CL 20 --RC 37 --RP 11 --WR 14 --CWL 8 --FAW 12 --RAS 20 --REF 65535 --RFC 248 --RTP 5 --RRDL 6 --RRDS 3 --WTRL 9 --WTRS 4 --RCDRD 12 --RCDWR 12` strap won't even go past 800 MemClk without crashing


[07/07/2021 5:04 PM] Licklobster#5542
wow, might be a dud card


[07/07/2021 5:04 PM] Licklobster#5542
or hurt in its past


[07/07/2021 5:04 PM] danandbeard#2312
the crash is fairly unique to my other few cards (maybe not unique to more experienced miners) in that once I get to a certain instability, mainly thru raising MemClk - the hashrate slowly grows until about 250 mh/s and then it crashes


[07/07/2021 5:04 PM] Licklobster#5542
the soc isnt overheating in the miner is it? (check Tj readout)


[07/07/2021 5:05 PM] danandbeard#2312
temps are actually very low


[07/07/2021 5:05 PM] Licklobster#5542
the soc is unrelated to board temps

[07/07/2021 5:05 PM] Licklobster#5542

yours looks fine


[07/07/2021 5:06 PM] Licklobster#5542
thats a -O01 bios yes?


[07/07/2021 5:06 PM] danandbeard#2312
~180 mh/s isn't the worst thing in the world, but I had to play around with a lot of stuff to get it there

it doesnt/cant change amp limits or power targets

oh, nice - good to know


[07/07/2021 5:08 PM] Licklobster#5542
not saying thats your issue, but it looks like you're on a silent bios that will have a low amp limit/power target


[07/07/2021 5:09 PM] Licklobster#5542
so it might be fighting you


[07/07/2021 5:10 PM] danandbeard#2312

you will be hard pressed to get to 200 with hynix, but it might be doable


[07/07/2021 5:12 PM] Licklobster#5542
1440/930 or 1440/950 will be close.

often the biggest issue with the ref blowers is heat

as long as they stay under ~80-85* mem you're usually good. things start to get less stable at 85

how make out with your card? I had just installed a Vega 56, had heeps of crashing issues. I found it to be Power supply side. I grabed a spare PSU and put it on just that card and boom. ALso even though mines a Samsung  here is what I ended up at. I peaked at 195 but was little unstable

[07/07/2021 5:44 PM] Pharotek#2932
I found for "this" card, if I went to 1400 on core MH/s wen down and once below 1300 it went down more. ALso the more I dropped the CDDV MH/s went up and ended up with it most stable at 910


[07/07/2021 5:49 PM] Pharotek#2932
@andee I did some probing on that Breakout Board the momentary switch infact just grounds out 3.2v to trip the PSU on. I ordered a Different style Breakout board that has a "Static Switch".  so will see how that works. For now what I did is I took the right side and Soldered the Reset button on the case to the Right(3v) side and the other lead to a good ground. This way can be dont with a simple button out side the case vs opening it all the time.


[07/07/2021 5:50 PM] danandbeard#2312
not sure what you're asking me - I'm still learning how to tweak as well, but my understanding is with samsung memory it's usually possible to be stable ~200 mh/s


[07/07/2021 5:50 PM] danandbeard#2312
how to get to 200mh/s ? - well I have no idea really, I just tweak things until it works


[07/07/2021 5:50 PM] Pharotek#2932
it's possiable but also depend on the card


[07/07/2021 5:50 PM] danandbeard#2312

[07/07/2021 5:51 PM] Pharotek#2932
only 2 of my 4 can go above 200. 203 and 208, but days down the road became unstable

I run all my vegas currently at 195ish and this one I just got i keep it at 186

[07/07/2021 5:53 PM] Pharotek#2932
195 vs 203-208 for endless days of non stop farming is worth the few mh

patients for tweaking, just use that flash licklobster gave you, add that memory tweak line. and start with one setting go up in 25-50 units watching what MH does after 2-3mins each step

the thing with vegas is used ones are always a grab bag

out of the box they were mostly all dogshit thermally, especially the blower ones

when used in pcs for gaming


[07/07/2021 6:14 PM] Licklobster#5542
so depending on prior use, i think some of them have some degradation on the memory chips and/or cores


[07/07/2021 6:14 PM] Licklobster#5542
because they were probably run melty hot


[07/07/2021 6:14 PM] Pharotek#2932
Also to note, I've seen others say they had issues with different miners like NB vs TeamRed. I helped a guy the other day that couldn't get past 145 and changed to teamred and jumped right up too 178 for little thought.

@Licklobster  should i flash my other 56's with this rom or should i not worry about them?


[07/08/2021 2:02 AM] Nythain#6769
You cant calculate how long, could happen anytime. You can calculate expected time to find a block at 100% difficulty, but i dont know the site people keep posting ss and snips from.


[07/08/2021 2:02 AM] Spheny#8442
I think woolypooly has a calculator but im not sure how accurate it is


[07/08/2021 2:02 AM] Spheny#8442
at 1200 mhs it reports 17 days


[07/08/2021 2:06 AM] Nythain#6769
Sounds about right. And thanks for the spot, i couldnt find it there before but overlooked the link.


[07/08/2021 2:07 AM] Spheny#8442

[07/08/2021 3:14 AM] Lincoln#2624
im only having 2 of 6 vega 56 show up in hive yet all fans are spinning link is good


[07/08/2021 3:14 AM] Lincoln#2624
they all showed up for a second and now only 2 anyone know what could be up?


[07/08/2021 3:53 AM] Lincoln#2624
now they show up but are still being weird


[07/08/2021 3:53 AM] Lincoln#2624
idk hive doesnt seem to like them


[07/08/2021 4:03 AM] Spheny#8442
can u see them if you run lspci in shell?


[07/08/2021 4:40 AM] Lincoln#2624
i see them but i cant get them going with nanominer for whatever reason


[07/08/2021 5:15 AM] Lincoln#2624

what's the difference between this channel and 'mining' ? :)

this one supports mining üôÇ


[07/08/2021 5:20 PM] miner29#2975
I mean it is right there in the title ü§£


[07/08/2021 5:34 PM] Nythain#6769
This one was set up more for miner issue help and oc. Though most still oc in mining


[07/08/2021 6:58 PM] VoodooRush#4006
These are LHR 3070s. I can't get them to perform like my non lhr 3070s. 

I tried changing pci-e slots, running only one card at a time, increasing w, nbminer/nanominer/t-rex. 

They fluctuate between 70-105 mh/s. Only time I see 170 is when I restart the miner. 

What am I missing?

LHR affects autolykos


[07/08/2021 7:11 PM] VoodooRush#4006
I get 110-115 with 3060 v2. Thought it would be the same So I would get around 150-160.


[07/08/2021 7:12 PM] VoodooRush#4006
Do you know if 3080s the same too?


[07/08/2021 7:14 PM] Spheny#8442
unsure on 3080s most people use 3080s on eth instead of erg


[07/08/2021 7:15 PM] VoodooRush#4006
3080 lhr on eth?


[07/08/2021 7:15 PM] Spheny#8442
i just meant 3080s in general even b4 lhr


[07/08/2021 7:47 PM] Herk#6019
for lhr cards it seems like 3070ti is the way to go


[07/08/2021 7:48 PM] Herk#6019
since they should be similar in price to the 3070 but people seem to get the same hashrate as a non-lhr 3070


[07/08/2021 8:07 PM] Terremot#4855
Heat is an issue with them


[07/08/2021 8:08 PM] Terremot#4855
they use GDDR6X


[07/08/2021 8:08 PM] Terremot#4855
which runs hot in 3080 and 3090

Why PL?


[07/09/2021 12:43 AM] miner29#2975
i dont use hive but thought the same on mmpos we use pl for nvidia and voltage for amd

[07/09/2021 1:10 AM] Licklobster#5542
Where did you fine those settings lul


[07/09/2021 1:24 AM] Pharotek#2932
what Lick said, Only time I've had those error's on my Vega's are due to clock to high, Not enought Core voltage, or PSU couldn't keep up.  clocks look okay for most part, but like Lick said get ride of the PL setting and set your Core voltage to 910-930 on all cards if stays stable for 25mins.


[07/09/2021 4:27 AM] intuit#0229
Had a rig stable for 5 days just to crash every 3 hours. turns out one of my 3080s eifher had a bad riser or mem oc. i dropped mem oc by 300 and its stable now.


[07/09/2021 6:18 AM] Lincoln#2624

[07/09/2021 6:48 PM] QthulhU#6553
Ive just got a new 3060TI and I was expecting it to get similar hashrates to my 3070 but I cant get it above 137mh/s no matter what i try. My 3070 gets 171mh/s üôÑ


[07/09/2021 6:48 PM] QthulhU#6553
Does anyone else have this problem?


[07/09/2021 6:51 PM] Licklobster#5542
3060 will need a lot more core then a 70


[07/09/2021 6:51 PM] QthulhU#6553
Even the TI?


[07/09/2021 6:53 PM] Licklobster#5542
yes


[07/09/2021 6:53 PM] Licklobster#5542
waaaaaaaay more


[07/09/2021 6:54 PM] Licklobster#5542
memory will be the same, but whatever your 70 is running corewise your 60ti will need 3-400mhz more


[07/09/2021 6:55 PM] QthulhU#6553
I have my 3070 core set to -502


[07/09/2021 6:55 PM] QthulhU#6553
And memory 1200


[07/09/2021 6:55 PM] QthulhU#6553
Ill try increasing it to -100?


[07/09/2021 6:56 PM] Licklobster#5542
try -300 or -200 core on the 60ti


[07/09/2021 6:56 PM] Licklobster#5542
see where you end up


[07/09/2021 6:57 PM] Licklobster#5542
dont forget the 60ti is a higher base clock, so that represents a lot more mhz


[07/09/2021 6:57 PM] QthulhU#6553
Okay trying -300 core and 1200 memory


[07/09/2021 6:59 PM] Licklobster#5542

it's a different card..

[07/09/2021 7:09 PM] QthulhU#6553
I guess 136 is better than nothing


[07/09/2021 7:11 PM] intuit#0229
Yeah better than nothing


[07/09/2021 7:11 PM] intuit#0229
Maybe try raven


[07/09/2021 7:11 PM] Herk#6019
or sell it and buy the 3070ti


[07/09/2021 7:13 PM] intuit#0229
Yeah


[07/09/2021 7:13 PM] VoodooRush#4006
I have the same problem with 3070 lhrs. No matter what I do I can't get over 100 mh/s.


[07/09/2021 7:13 PM] VoodooRush#4006
They are worse than my v2 3060s.


[07/09/2021 7:13 PM] intuit#0229
Oh one of my rigs, I think 4 gpu out of 8 went offline for no reason. Not sure if it‚Äôs because of the splitter or not? Those 4 were on the same pcie 1-4 splitter


[07/09/2021 7:14 PM] VoodooRush#4006
But they get normal hashrate at raven. If you can't return it mine raven.


[07/09/2021 7:14 PM] intuit#0229
Only happened twice in 2 weeks but both happened today and yesterday


[07/09/2021 7:14 PM] intuit#0229
Oh wow that sucks


[07/09/2021 7:14 PM] intuit#0229
Hmm is it because of driver issues?


[07/09/2021 7:14 PM] intuit#0229
The 80ti was hash limited in the beginning too


[07/09/2021 7:15 PM] intuit#0229
Did you update to the newest 471 driver?


[07/09/2021 7:15 PM] VoodooRush#4006
haven't tried on windows, using on hive os, linux drivers are a little behind. Will do that tomorrow after I move some cards around.


[07/09/2021 7:16 PM] VoodooRush#4006
I expected 3070s to behave similiar to other lhr cards. They only lose around 20 mh/s


[07/09/2021 7:17 PM] VoodooRush#4006
3060s get 110-115 instead of 125. 3070tis get 180 instead of 215. 3080tis get 255 instead of 275.


[07/09/2021 7:17 PM] VoodooRush#4006
But these 3070s get half the hashrate.


[07/09/2021 7:17 PM] intuit#0229
Yeha it might just be driver issue


[07/09/2021 7:18 PM] VoodooRush#4006
hoping that is the issue


[07/09/2021 7:18 PM] QthulhU#6553
I want to support ergo - 136 isnt too off


[07/09/2021 7:19 PM] VoodooRush#4006
atm 3060 and 70ti/80ti lhrs are the best price/performance for ergo imo.


[07/09/2021 7:19 PM] VoodooRush#4006
same. not switching my 3080s to eth.


[07/09/2021 7:22 PM] Licklobster#5542

Also I meant lhr cards.


[07/09/2021 7:24 PM] VoodooRush#4006
if we are talking every card In Turkey 3070 non lhr's are the way to go.


[07/09/2021 7:25 PM] VoodooRush#4006
Vegas go for $950 used. 3070 non lhrs and Ti's go around ebay prices.


[07/09/2021 7:34 PM] Licklobster#5542
950?


[07/09/2021 7:34 PM] Licklobster#5542
seems... high.


[07/09/2021 7:34 PM] Licklobster#5542
by like $400

On a 30a circuit


[07/10/2021 2:38 AM] danandbeard#2312
mostly depends on how much wire you gotta run


[07/10/2021 2:40 AM] danandbeard#2312
the wire will be the most expensive part, but if you DIY 25ft run maybe $100ish if you already have the tools


[07/10/2021 2:40 AM] danandbeard#2312
quickly goes up with distance though as the wire is the most expensive part


[07/10/2021 2:42 AM] danandbeard#2312
huh, looks like big box store wire is way marked up - that crap is half the price online


[07/10/2021 2:43 AM] danandbeard#2312
let it be noted that I am not recommending you install this yourself though - it's not terribly difficult, but obviously a mistake can be lethal


[07/10/2021 4:26 AM] ‚≤§√§ùìõ√§‚≤ò‚≤í‚Ä†‚≤®#3054
depends on the length of the run and how much space is empty is your panel


[07/10/2021 4:26 AM] ‚≤§√§ùìõ√§‚≤ò‚≤í‚Ä†‚≤®#3054
wire prices are kinda out of control right now, like lumber üò¶


[07/10/2021 4:30 AM] ‚≤§√§ùìõ√§‚≤ò‚≤í‚Ä†‚≤®#3054
250ft roll of 10/2 romex is over $300, so you'd probably be looking a min of $500 unless it's really close to a panel


[07/10/2021 5:21 AM] danandbeard#2312
ebay has 10/2 250ft at $250 and the other supplies are incredibly cheap, no?


[07/10/2021 5:21 AM] danandbeard#2312
where's your other $200 coming from in that example?

doesn't seem liek you'd want or need to restart the entire miner - requests should just timeout and then start back up when you're connection is good - but your connection will never be good because you're connecting to nanopool :p

[07/10/2021 9:11 AM] WINNI#3324
thanks! this sound like a good plan


[07/10/2021 9:11 AM] where_cookie#3129
Can probably find a quick YouTube video on it, or a quick Google search might suffice


[07/10/2021 9:11 AM] where_cookie#3129
Either way a few b450s have 6 pcie slots if not


[07/10/2021 9:12 AM] where_cookie#3129
MSI B450 GAMING PLUS MAX AM4 ATX Motherboard


[07/10/2021 9:12 AM] where_cookie#3129
Has 6


[07/10/2021 9:15 AM] WINNI#3324
i will check the details if one pcie gets disabled if i use one of the 6

[07/10/2021 9:16 AM] WINNI#3324
if i use gen2 in bios, all of the 6 should work, if i understand the graphics correctly


[07/10/2021 9:32 AM] Herk#6019
b450 has only 1 m.2 slot?


[07/10/2021 9:33 AM] Herk#6019
if so, you can probably get 10 cards on the B450 gaming plus max


[07/10/2021 9:34 AM] Herk#6019
with m.2 to pcie adapter and pcie 1 to 4 splitter


[07/10/2021 9:37 AM] Andrius#5701
yes, they work. Recomended


[07/10/2021 9:37 AM] WINNI#3324
sick, but 6 would be the goal, because i want to build couple of 6s vega rigs


[07/10/2021 9:38 AM] Andrius#5701
you can add even 16 üôÇ


[07/10/2021 9:38 AM] Andrius#5701
if you have adapter üôÇ


[07/10/2021 9:38 AM] Andrius#5701
i'm running 8 at the moment on 6 slot MB


[07/10/2021 9:38 AM] WINNI#3324
how will it show in hiveos? Because gpu0 for example is bind to the first pcie slot. if i have 4 in that slot now, will they all be "gpu0" ?


[07/10/2021 9:39 AM] Andrius#5701
gpu10 or so


[07/10/2021 9:39 AM] Andrius#5701
let me check

[07/10/2021 9:41 AM] Andrius#5701

this should also work right? i just need usb from pcie


[07/10/2021 9:44 AM] WINNI#3324
or is it better if i get the one mentioned earliere


[07/10/2021 9:44 AM] WINNI#3324
could save up to 20 bucks ü§£


[07/10/2021 9:44 AM] Andrius#5701
i dont think so


[07/10/2021 9:44 AM] Andrius#5701
its just usb adapter


[07/10/2021 9:44 AM] Andrius#5701
you need pcie x1 to x4


[07/10/2021 9:45 AM] where_cookie#3129
Yeah, I just did a quick Amazon search


[07/10/2021 9:45 AM] where_cookie#3129
But, I don't know what a good price is


[07/10/2021 9:46 AM] WINNI#3324
cheapest i found was also 28


[07/10/2021 9:46 AM] WINNI#3324
without prime though


[07/10/2021 9:46 AM] Andrius#5701
They sell for 10-30 USD in Aliexpress


[07/10/2021 9:46 AM] WINNI#3324
aliexpress has it  for 18


[07/10/2021 9:46 AM] WINNI#3324
yeah ! üòÑ


[07/10/2021 9:47 AM] Andrius#5701
so double that for US price


[07/10/2021 9:47 AM] Andrius#5701
I paid 40EUR for Prime


[07/10/2021 9:48 AM] Andrius#5701
another one is coming on monday


[07/10/2021 9:48 AM] Andrius#5701
Will add 9th gpu to Z-490-A Prime MB


[07/10/2021 9:49 AM] Herk#6019
not sure, what adapter are you talking about?


[07/10/2021 9:50 AM] Herk#6019
for the 1 to 4 splitter, you can use only 1 per board afaik


[07/10/2021 9:54 AM] WINNI#3324
thanks guys, helped a lot

[07/10/2021 10:12 AM] Herk#6019
on a z490?


[07/10/2021 10:13 AM] Herk#6019
I can't tell how many cards do you have in each


[07/10/2021 10:14 AM] Herk#6019
on a z390 it works with 4 + 1, as soon as you plug the second card in the other adapter it just hangs


[07/10/2021 10:14 AM] Andrius#5701
maybe it depends on mb


[07/10/2021 10:15 AM] Andrius#5701
havent tried on 490


[07/10/2021 10:15 AM] Andrius#5701
it was on X570 AORUS Master


[07/10/2021 10:15 AM] Herk#6019
oh I see


[07/10/2021 10:15 AM] Andrius#5701
I will check and thanks üòâ


[07/10/2021 10:15 AM] Andrius#5701
i still have 1 pcie slot empy anyway


[07/10/2021 10:15 AM] Herk#6019
no probs, I'll have a look at that board as well


[07/10/2021 10:15 AM] Andrius#5701
plus i have same mb with 2x3060 and 3x3070


[07/10/2021 10:16 AM] Herk#6019
I don't mind switching to amd if it takes more cards üòÑ


[07/10/2021 10:16 AM] WINNI#3324
x570 aorus master is a beast, i had it for gaming ü§£


[07/10/2021 10:16 AM] Herk#6019
I tried with nothing plugged in pcie just the adapters... so it's not about pcie lanes for sure


[07/10/2021 10:16 AM] Herk#6019
maybe something to do with bifurcation, not really sure


[07/10/2021 10:16 AM] WINNI#3324
what you guys prefere server psu + pico adapter or server psu + atx psu for mb/cpu


[07/10/2021 10:16 AM] Andrius#5701
i just wanted to check if it will work with second x1 to x4 adapter


[07/10/2021 10:16 AM] Andrius#5701
have you tried to change to gen1.0?


[07/10/2021 10:17 AM] Andrius#5701
atx


[07/10/2021 10:17 AM] Herk#6019
oh yes the board is already running 11 gpus


[07/10/2021 10:17 AM] Andrius#5701
i use cpu adapters to pcie as well


[07/10/2021 10:17 AM] Herk#6019
all on gen1, using all pcie + m.2


[07/10/2021 10:18 AM] WINNI#3324
but the output from wall is way to high 
i have atx + psu and hiveos showed 800w for cards. output from wall 1180

Atx PSU = bequiet 500W (didnt had something beter)
Server psu: 94% hp 1200w


[07/10/2021 10:18 AM] Andrius#5701
I will try to post my test on Monday


[07/10/2021 10:18 AM] Herk#6019
thanks, looking forward to it


[07/10/2021 10:18 AM] Andrius#5701
Server psu most of the are loud


[07/10/2021 10:18 AM] Andrius#5701
true?


[07/10/2021 10:21 AM] Andrius#5701

[07/10/2021 12:23 PM] Herk#6019
very interesting, can't really find it anywhere besides at 1 seller from china with 0 feedbacks


[07/10/2021 12:24 PM] Herk#6019
what CPU are you using on this board?


[07/10/2021 12:25 PM] Herk#6019
on the one which has 2x 1 to 4 splitters in use I mean


[07/10/2021 12:56 PM] Andrius#5701
it's not mine but thry use AMD Ryzen 5600x


[07/10/2021 1:15 PM] Herk#6019
I see


[07/10/2021 1:37 PM] intuit#0229
I used 3 on a b450 and it worked fine


[07/10/2021 1:37 PM] Herk#6019
woah


[07/10/2021 1:38 PM] Herk#6019
time to switch to amd then üòÑ


[07/10/2021 1:38 PM] intuit#0229
Ah?


[07/10/2021 1:38 PM] intuit#0229
Oh the board


[07/10/2021 1:38 PM] Herk#6019
yes


[07/10/2021 1:38 PM] intuit#0229
I used 2 on a z490 and that worked fine too


[07/10/2021 1:38 PM] Herk#6019
well I'll try on a z490 first


[07/10/2021 1:38 PM] intuit#0229
Didn‚Äôt try three before


[07/10/2021 1:39 PM] Herk#6019
2 on my z490 would basically use a maximum of 14 out of a total of 16 pcie lanes that my cpu supports


[07/10/2021 1:39 PM] Herk#6019
would just make the system complete


[07/10/2021 1:40 PM] where_cookie#3129
Guess it would also depend on what CPU u using tho right


[07/10/2021 1:40 PM] where_cookie#3129
Needs to have enough lanes


[07/10/2021 1:40 PM] intuit#0229
Hmm I‚Äôm not even sure


[07/10/2021 1:40 PM] intuit#0229
I have an i9-10850k


[07/10/2021 1:40 PM] Herk#6019
well.. I tried 2 splitters with just 2 cards plugged in each on a z390 board


[07/10/2021 1:40 PM] Herk#6019
it doesn't turn on


[07/10/2021 1:40 PM] Herk#6019
otherwise the board works fine with 1 and all the pcie/m.2 slots filled with gpus


[07/10/2021 1:40 PM] where_cookie#3129
Yeah, cheap CPUs for mining rigs might not be enough tbh


[07/10/2021 1:41 PM] Herk#6019
so doesn't look like a cpu limitation in this case..


[07/10/2021 1:41 PM] where_cookie#3129
For running a lot


[07/10/2021 1:41 PM] where_cookie#3129
Just in general tho


[07/10/2021 1:41 PM] intuit#0229
I mean it should be enough lanes though


[07/10/2021 1:41 PM] intuit#0229
1-4 is just 4 lanes


[07/10/2021 1:41 PM] Herk#6019
yep


[07/10/2021 1:41 PM] where_cookie#3129
To run like 2-3 of those splitters?


[07/10/2021 1:41 PM] where_cookie#3129
What I'm referring to


[07/10/2021 1:41 PM] Herk#6019
yes, it's the total number of lanes that matters apparently


[07/10/2021 1:41 PM] intuit#0229
Yeah 3 of them is just 12 lanes


[07/10/2021 1:42 PM] Herk#6019
you could use a splitter in each of the 6 pcie ports, the actual pcie lanes are used when you plug something in the usb slots basically


[07/10/2021 1:42 PM] intuit#0229
Yeah


[07/10/2021 1:42 PM] intuit#0229
The splitter even works with the pcie x1 slot


[07/10/2021 1:43 PM] Herk#6019
yep it's really handy, no need to pay over the odds for "mining" motherboards


[07/10/2021 1:44 PM] intuit#0229
I just purchased a mining mobo combo just because I don‚Äôt want to use my i9 as a mining rig


[07/10/2021 1:44 PM] intuit#0229
Although I felt like it was a little expensive but it‚Äôs fine


[07/10/2021 1:45 PM] intuit#0229
TB250 BTC pro with Intel pentium and 4GB of ram for $170


[07/10/2021 1:46 PM] Herk#6019
oh that's really good though, that board would be around $350 here


[07/10/2021 1:46 PM] Herk#6019
and the 6 pcie slots one is $140+


[07/10/2021 1:47 PM] intuit#0229
Oh wow


[07/10/2021 1:47 PM] intuit#0229
I got mine on eBay


[07/10/2021 1:48 PM] intuit#0229
I was gonna get a x79, Intel 477*, 16GB of ram for around $180 yesterday but idk


[07/10/2021 1:48 PM] intuit#0229
I wanted to consolidate 2-3 of my rtx 3060s on there


[07/10/2021 1:49 PM] intuit#0229
Probably not worth it since I can just take a profit hit mining ergo instead


[07/10/2021 4:30 PM] Andrius#5701
try diferent usb riser slots


[07/10/2021 4:32 PM] intuit#0229
Hmm my nanopool still didn‚Äôt payout


[07/10/2021 4:33 PM] Andrius#5701
z-490-a prime can hold 2x3060, my cpu is 16 lance..so they use already all lanes from cpu...I have extra 6 gpus running on same motherboard


[07/10/2021 4:33 PM] Andrius#5701
x1x4 adapter should take only 1 lane


[07/10/2021 4:33 PM] intuit#0229
My z490 can only do 1 3060 I believe


[07/10/2021 4:33 PM] intuit#0229
But it causes instability with my other gpus


[07/10/2021 4:34 PM] Andrius#5701
maybe different model


[07/10/2021 4:34 PM] intuit#0229
So I just don‚Äôt use the 3060 with it


[07/10/2021 4:34 PM] Andrius#5701
Asus z490-A Prime


[07/10/2021 4:34 PM] intuit#0229
I know my main rig x570 aorus master can do 2


[07/10/2021 4:34 PM] intuit#0229
But I rather keep my 3090 in there


[07/10/2021 5:39 PM] andee#4722

$250 shipped? cause that roll of wire is going to be heavy, lol.  home depot and anywhere else is $300 for 250'.  the other parts are super cheap.  The other $200 I factored in if you were having someone else do the work for you.  If you're going to do it yourself, easy peasy. it's really not that hard.  But depending on where you want to run the wire you would have to cut drywall and fish it to where ever it's going unless you're just going to drop it below the panel

nethash drops


[07/10/2021 8:01 PM] intuit#0229
Since I only have 4 ERGs


[07/10/2021 8:01 PM] Licklobster#5542
because ergo diff adjusts too slowly


[07/10/2021 8:01 PM] Licklobster#5542
and there isnt enough power on the net to keep up with the log.

[07/10/2021 8:01 PM] intuit#0229
Does this mean it‚Äôs easier or harder to mine?


[07/10/2021 8:01 PM] Licklobster#5542
well its made harder to mine


[07/10/2021 8:01 PM] Licklobster#5542
then people leave because diff is too high


[07/10/2021 8:01 PM] Licklobster#5542
then hash drops


[07/10/2021 8:02 PM] Licklobster#5542
then its hard to mine AND the hash is lower.


[07/10/2021 8:02 PM] Licklobster#5542

use one of the remote access options, get in, put a generated password and set up ssh keys and disable password logins

you'd hope.


[07/10/2021 8:23 PM] danandbeard#2312
you can always bust out a multimeter and see if resistance/voltage under load is what you expect - given that is the case I can't imagine romex getting away with serving shittier wire products in different locations

books?  I don't think you need or want to understand electrical circuitry entirely - just lookup safety codes and why they exist and test your shit to make sure your hardware is rated for the use

All 3060 are lhr pretty much

Set power 60%
-350 core
+1200 mem should get you a good start

is it possible to derive the average number of attempts (nonces/hashes) for certain mining difficulty? Like `initialDifficultyHex = "01"`


[07/11/2021 5:07 PM] danandbeard#2312
yeah, it should be...inputs won't matter just look at hash space and figure out how many hashes would qualify as a solution and you've got your probability for one event


[07/11/2021 5:08 PM] danandbeard#2312
(inputs don't matter because hashing algos are typically designed strong distribution so even a single input bit being changed should produce a remarkably different output)

hi, i usually have a rough average of 60+ shares/hour @56mhs with a 1660s on hero and leaf. however the past 2 days im only getting a rough average of 30 something shares an hour which brought my earnings down quite significantly. The miner still runs at 56mhs but leaf 5h average showed 41mhs and hero 24h average 42mhs instead of the usual 54mhs-55mhs (no rejected shares reported). any reason why ive been finding lesser shares (hero and leaf running on default starting diff without change)?


[07/12/2021 10:14 AM] AeonRemnant#3905

thanks, could be yeah, shares still low but eh at least its better than nothing


[07/12/2021 1:11 PM] danandbeard#2312
are you sure earnings have gone down?  some pools do variable difficulty and your individual difficulty may have gone up - that wouldn't decrease earnings though, because a more difficult share would be worth more and (provided the pool doesn't have a bug) thus you'd earn roughly the same


[07/12/2021 1:17 PM] Andrius#5701
all good...second x1 to x4 adapter worked fine with 3070 on Z490-A Prime MB with all together 9 gpus and 16 lanes CPU

@danandbeard If varDiff increases difficulty, his accumulated shares would go up as well.


[07/12/2021 1:43 PM] dewyeyes#2992
yep, i noticed the reward proportion from a block is lesser. afaik hero is vardiff with a starting of 4g and i dont think my individual diff increased as always show 4g without change


[07/12/2021 1:59 PM] Herk#6019
so you have 2 and both filled with gpus?

[07/12/2021 2:00 PM] Andrius#5701

[07/12/2021 2:00 PM] Andrius#5701
it takes 1 lane anyway


[07/12/2021 2:20 PM] danandbeard#2312
you mean go down?


[07/12/2021 2:20 PM] danandbeard#2312
difficulty going up means you'll find less shares


[07/12/2021 2:21 PM] Erazor#9864
Yeah, but pools usually sum up the difficulty to account for this as the number of shares means nothing.


[07/12/2021 2:22 PM] danandbeard#2312
do pools typically alter the existing shares if they alter difficulty?  I would've assumed they just kept shares in different buckets according to their associated difficulty


[07/12/2021 2:23 PM] danandbeard#2312
I guess for reporting purposes that makes some sense to give end users a better idea of the rate of growth since many miners may not understand what a "share" actually represents


[07/12/2021 2:28 PM] Erazor#9864
A share has usually has just a difficulty value and a network difficulty value. Stuff like buckets is simply not necessary.


[07/12/2021 2:31 PM] danandbeard#2312
if you change a users share difficulty you'd need to know which shares were found using which difficulty to evenly distribute funds, there are other ways to solve it than using key/value pairs but I'm not exactly sure how most pools would want to report that, since not all shares are equal


[07/12/2021 2:32 PM] danandbeard#2312
so no you wouldn't need to keep up with it, but reporting shares across multiple difficulty settings would require that


[07/12/2021 2:33 PM] Erazor#9864
Yes, that's why you record the difficulty currently assigned to a miner with every received share along with the block's network difficulty.


[07/12/2021 2:33 PM] danandbeard#2312
right, that would be the buckets I was referencing


[07/12/2021 2:34 PM] danandbeard#2312
I just mean that some other data is associated with a share because not all shares are equal


[07/12/2021 2:34 PM] danandbeard#2312
which has me wondering how herominer is reporting my shares, I guess total shares is a useless report they give me just to look nice?


[07/12/2021 2:39 PM] Erazor#9864
Unless - like I said earlier - total shares is the sum of all share's difficulty value.


[07/12/2021 3:04 PM] danandbeard#2312
ah, I didn't understand that to be what you mean - I wouldn't suspect that is the case though since you'd likely want to move difficulty with a finer grain control than whole numbers


[07/12/2021 3:04 PM] danandbeard#2312
at least with herominer they don't show fractional shares


[07/12/2021 3:07 PM] danandbeard#2312
honestly pools should do a better job at explaining what a share is in the first place - if they're just obfuscating over all the details trying to give people back simple numbers - then the UX is pretty terrible

I have one gpu that periodically restarts
it doesnt seem to be from temp issues and the physical connectors look fine as well? im not sure what is happening

[07/12/2021 3:51 PM] danandbeard#2312
that seems like a very low VDD for a vega56


[07/12/2021 3:51 PM] danandbeard#2312
probably just unstable


[07/12/2021 5:31 PM] Herk#6019
should, it works for me with only one gpu plugged in the second splitter but no more üôÇ


[07/12/2021 5:34 PM] Andrius#5701
I will try to add 2 more gpus..maybe tomorrow

disable stuff like onboard audio to maximize available lanes


[07/12/2021 5:59 PM] Herk#6019
I disabled everything... including LAN


[07/12/2021 5:59 PM] Herk#6019
but it was on a Z390


[07/12/2021 6:18 PM] danandbeard#2312
don't do what I did and disable USB though...had to bios reset just to get my keyboard to work to enter bios LUL


[07/12/2021 6:18 PM] danandbeard#2312
I went a bit overboard with disabling I guess üòÇ


[07/12/2021 6:24 PM] Herk#6019
haha I was thinking of doing that the other day just to see if it would make a difference but I instead unplugged all other other gpus to free pcie lanes and it made no difference


[07/12/2021 6:24 PM] Herk#6019
so, in my case, it seems to be a mobo "issue"


[07/12/2021 6:58 PM] intuit#0229

what hashrate/ at the wall wattage are you getting?


[07/12/2021 8:01 PM] Lincoln#2624
155mh and software says 900w on 7x 56


[07/12/2021 8:05 PM] P1ro#0405
Hi, anyone else its mining with a nv1060 3gb here? i cant get more that 40Mh, its there anything i could try? thanks.


[07/12/2021 8:13 PM] danandbeard#2312
check pinned messages in #‚õè‚îÇmining theres a hashrate spreadsheet with some info on there


[07/12/2021 8:13 PM] danandbeard#2312
looks like 1060 3GB are getting around 48mh/s

enabled memtweak yet?


[07/12/2021 9:43 PM] P1ro#0405
@Nythain right now im only using OC atfer burn on windows with T-Rex, how i can enable it?


[07/12/2021 9:43 PM] P1ro#0405
@danandbeard i will, thanks


[07/12/2021 9:44 PM] Nythain#6769
```       --mt                       Memory tweak mode (default: 0 - disabled). Range from 0 to 6. General recommendation
                                   is to start with 1, and then increase only if the GPU is stable.
                                   The effect is similar to that of ETHlargementPill.
                                   Supported on Pascal GPUs with GDDR5 or GDDR5X memory only.
                                   Requires running the miner with administrative privileges.
                                   Can be set to a comma separated list to apply different values to different cards.
                                   Example: --mt 4 (applies tweak mode #4 to all cards that support this functionality)
                                            --mt 3,3,3,0 (applies tweak mode #3 to all cards except the last one)```


[07/12/2021 9:45 PM] Nythain#6769
basically add --mt 1 to your command in your bat file, then run as admin so the miner can install the memtweak driver and viola


[07/12/2021 9:54 PM] P1ro#0405
Thanks, yes im doing it right now, i was used to do it on hiveos panel, so far with --mt 3 im getting 8-9MH more


[07/12/2021 9:56 PM] P1ro#0405
if some1 know and can explain to me a bit better, if ergo is more core related and not vram why these nvidia with better core clock that amd are dont far worse ?!


[07/12/2021 9:57 PM] andee#4722
it is mainly memory. but needs more core than eth to utilize the memory to the fullest, probably a little card dependent though. older rx cards are impossible to max out without having high enough core


[07/12/2021 10:05 PM] danandbeard#2312
hmm, so I have a nitro+ vega 56 - had the OC switch (that most (all?)) vega cards have flipped away from ports and I flashed it first time - wouldn't detect the card...flipped towards the ports and it worked and even showed the updated bios

well I decided to try a different bios and flashed again - now neither switch positions detect this card - any troubleshooting tips for getting this cards bios hopefully flashed properly?


[07/12/2021 10:08 PM] andee#4722
force flash a known working bios


[07/12/2021 10:08 PM] P1ro#0405
or check bios switch


[07/12/2021 10:10 PM] danandbeard#2312
yeah I need to make sure linux sees the card - hiveos GUI doesn't show the card as detected though üò¨


[07/12/2021 10:10 PM] danandbeard#2312
if linux doesn't see the card I'm assuming it can't flash it


[07/12/2021 10:11 PM] andee#4722
ssh to rig and use atiflash manually

crap, atiflash doesn't show the card


[07/12/2021 10:13 PM] danandbeard#2312
gonna mess around with different risers/pcie slots and see what happens


[07/12/2021 10:14 PM] P1ro#0405
can you try to connect it without a riser ?


[07/12/2021 10:14 PM] danandbeard#2312
not easily, but I can try that as a last ditch effort


[07/12/2021 10:14 PM] P1ro#0405
ahhh 1060 its back at 48MH


[07/12/2021 10:15 PM] P1ro#0405
well play with riser a bit


[07/12/2021 10:16 PM] andee#4722
@danandbeard try to connect a monitor to the card in the main x16 slot


[07/12/2021 10:24 PM] andee#4722
@danandbeard you might need to use amdvbflash


[07/12/2021 10:34 PM] danandbeard#2312
yeah I think in hiveos atiflash might be aliased to amdvbflash


[07/12/2021 10:34 PM] danandbeard#2312
or at least the options appeared the same? I'll look into it


[07/12/2021 10:36 PM] danandbeard#2312
I think I may have done it - I suspect there's some damage to the card and I just got lucky that it's not totally bricked, but still playing around so there's time left to completely brick it xD


[07/12/2021 10:36 PM] danandbeard#2312
I kinda wouldn't even be mad - I want a chance to try and repair a card :p


[07/12/2021 10:36 PM] andee#4722
the interface is the same, but device support is different I think


[07/12/2021 10:37 PM] P1ro#0405
well you can always flash the bios with a spi programmer


[07/12/2021 10:37 PM] danandbeard#2312
nice, that may be what fixed it for me - it at least pretended to flash it this time so we'll see


[07/12/2021 11:02 PM] danandbeard#2312
lol now I can't get hiveos to boot from a known working card - RIP - I'll have to tinker with it later xD


[07/12/2021 11:45 PM] danandbeard#2312
is there a way to download bios from a card for backup?


[07/12/2021 11:45 PM] danandbeard#2312
I'm wanting to download bios from another card and try them on this broken card


[07/12/2021 11:46 PM] danandbeard#2312
(and also just wanna backup this bios to try other bios on this working card for tweaking purposes)


[07/12/2021 11:47 PM] danandbeard#2312
nvm I see the option in amdvbflash now


[07/12/2021 11:47 PM] danandbeard#2312
(amdvbflash -s)


[07/13/2021 12:29 AM] Licklobster#5542
you can also flash over bricked bioses on unrecognized cards


[07/13/2021 12:30 AM] Licklobster#5542
it takes some manual maneuvering and cleverness - but i've done it a few times


[07/13/2021 12:31 AM] danandbeard#2312
yeah, I think I managed to flash it a few times, but it's not booting still so I think there's some larger issues at play here


[07/13/2021 12:31 AM] Licklobster#5542
not all nitro bioses


[07/13/2021 12:31 AM] Licklobster#5542
work on all nitro+s


[07/13/2021 12:31 AM] Licklobster#5542

yeah I tried to boot it on a known working bios too - no dice


[07/13/2021 12:32 AM] Licklobster#5542
unless it was that cards' own bios - they generally enforce signature unless you use an unsigned bios


[07/13/2021 12:32 AM] danandbeard#2312
I'ma gonna open it up and see if I can find a short - been wanting a reason to learn to fix GPUs anyways, so maybe I'll get lucky and it'll be a busted cap or something xD


[07/13/2021 12:32 AM] Licklobster#5542
good luck


[07/13/2021 12:33 AM] danandbeard#2312
I was force flashing, would signatures cause no boot or just no flash?


[07/13/2021 12:33 AM] Licklobster#5542
no b oot

if its compatible or not


[07/13/2021 12:34 AM] Licklobster#5542
the silent side is usually write protected


[07/13/2021 12:34 AM] Licklobster#5542
the OC side is where you'd flash


[07/13/2021 12:34 AM] Licklobster#5542
if only one side boots its OK to flip the switch while card is on

@andee so I got into my breakout boards on my HP 1200 server psu. MY conclusion: The below breakout board style are junk. They make a 8/12/18 gpu board. It couldn't distribute power well and would cause crashes. Also have to manually power it up every time. I advise people to stay away from this style

[07/13/2021 3:30 AM] Pharotek#2932
If the switch is all way to left it will automatically power back up.. it also delivers power to all gpu better. I was able to remove the extra psu I needed for my latest card I added for the other board would crash it.

Tweaking the mem and core have only really been giving me marginal improvements and I *really* want to avoid allowing more voltage.

-500 on the core 130w PL & 65 fan


[07/13/2021 8:24 AM] Camellia#0001
Think you can push them a lot harder


[07/13/2021 8:25 AM] Camellia#0001
I‚Äôve heard people getting them up to 2700 or 2800


[07/13/2021 8:25 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
If I feel like running the voltage like crazy I can probably push 2800 or so.


[07/13/2021 8:29 AM] Camellia#0001
Well what do you get with 2600 on the mem?


[07/13/2021 8:29 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
171 to 173.


[07/13/2021 8:29 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
I'm pretty certain it was a reboot causing issues.


[07/13/2021 8:29 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
2700 is stable, checking 2800 now.

[07/13/2021 8:33 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Oh shit! They're actually booting at 2800.


[07/13/2021 8:33 AM] Camellia#0001
Booting maybe


[07/13/2021 8:33 AM] Camellia#0001

[07/13/2021 5:31 PM] WINNI#3324
hey, is it normal, that my rig pulls almost 1200W from the wall, while 5 x vega in hiveos shows 800. i waas excpeting around 900 - 1000 but not 1200


[07/13/2021 5:33 PM] Licklobster#5542
normal


[07/13/2021 5:33 PM] WINNI#3324
using 1200w with a serverpsu for gpus and 500w atx for mainboard/cpu


[07/13/2021 5:33 PM] Licklobster#5542
low power (750mv) vega is 130w each, high power vega is 200-220w each


[07/13/2021 5:33 PM] WINNI#3324
ok thank you, was jus worried because hiveos showed such small numbers


[07/13/2021 5:34 PM] WINNI#3324
is the 1200w psu enough for he cards?


[07/13/2021 5:34 PM] Licklobster#5542
1200w psu pulling 1200w?


[07/13/2021 5:34 PM] WINNI#3324
no 500w atx for mb/cpu and 1200w for he graphicscard


[07/13/2021 5:35 PM] WINNI#3324
total ouput from wall 1191


[07/13/2021 5:35 PM] Licklobster#5542
guess it depends on what your cards are actually pulling vs the chassis


[07/13/2021 5:35 PM] Licklobster#5542
probably a bit high on the psu


[07/13/2021 5:35 PM] Licklobster#5542
maybe run a single card on the 500w?


[07/13/2021 5:35 PM] WINNI#3324
ok, thats what i was worried too


[07/13/2021 5:36 PM] WINNI#3324
that is an idea which i should do i think


[07/13/2021 5:36 PM] WINNI#3324
oh its 400w the atx psu


[07/13/2021 5:37 PM] WINNI#3324
but should still be better 400W = MB/CPU and GPU and 1200W 4 Cards


[07/13/2021 5:39 PM] danandbeard#2312
I would suspect your mb/cpu in a mining rig is pulling very little so I would expect 1 card on the 400w to be fine, but you can always test it since you have a wall monitor


[07/13/2021 5:40 PM] intuit#0229
A 1200w server psu can pull 1260w easily

[07/13/2021 8:47 PM] arokace#8057
If you setup the wallet then you should be able to just create a new API.  The wallet you created should have had mnemonic seed that you saved somewhere.  Which will let you bring the wallet into the new API key.

ok so there is stuff in it. Then I don't want to give more advice because I forgot if when I created my wallet and had this similar issue if I was able to bring in my original wallet or just restarted the whole process.

The fact there's a mnemonic phrase tells me you should just be fine to restart the whole node process and you'll be able to bring the wallet in.


[07/13/2021 8:51 PM] Terremot#4855
lol.  I'm a dumbass


[07/13/2021 8:51 PM] Terremot#4855

and elsewhere ofc


[07/13/2021 8:52 PM] Terremot#4855
I seriously was doubting my own sanity


[07/13/2021 8:53 PM] arokace#8057
Well, maybe you should still be doubting that.  I think that's part of the human experience


[07/13/2021 8:54 PM] Terremot#4855
Do I need to leave the node on so that the erg transfers into the wallet?


[07/13/2021 8:54 PM] arokace#8057
No but I would still let it sync though


[07/13/2021 8:54 PM] Terremot#4855
I intended to


[07/13/2021 8:55 PM] arokace#8057
That way when you finally do care about checking, you will be able to without waiting long on updating the sync.  I leave it running all the time personally but that's just so there's another node out there too.


[07/13/2021 9:11 PM] Terremot#4855
It's all synched


[07/13/2021 9:11 PM] Terremot#4855
but since I'm constantly mining to the wallet, that's why it's always synching


[07/13/2021 9:12 PM] andee#4722
you don't need the node running to receive the mining rewards. but it has to be synced to reflect your latest balance and to be able to spend


[07/13/2021 9:12 PM] Terremot#4855
That's good to know


[07/13/2021 9:13 PM] Terremot#4855
transferred a massive 35 ERG into my wallet


[07/13/2021 9:13 PM] Terremot#4855

[07/13/2021 9:14 PM] andee#4722
I have seen a couple of coins where the wallet needs to be online for transactions to go through, strange concept


[07/13/2021 9:15 PM] Terremot#4855
a lot of wallets are actually online


[07/13/2021 9:15 PM] Terremot#4855
such as metamask


[07/13/2021 9:16 PM] andee#4722
it connects to a remote node but the keys are on your computer


[07/13/2021 9:17 PM] andee#4722
you can run a local node and connect metamask to it


[07/13/2021 9:26 PM] Terremot#4855
hmm


[07/13/2021 9:26 PM] Terremot#4855
interesting


[07/13/2021 9:29 PM] arokace#8057
Didn't know that about metamask.  that's kool


[07/13/2021 9:37 PM] Terremot#4855
so technically you could directly link it to a trezor


[07/13/2021 9:38 PM] arokace#8057
um, not sure.  But I know its generally not a good idea to mine directly to a hardware wallet.  or at least that's what I've heard before.


[07/14/2021 12:18 AM] danandbeard#2312
interesting, why would it matter what the wallet is you're mining to?


[07/14/2021 12:28 AM] arokace#8057
its what I've heard before.  Something about them being slow.  At least the older versions of the hardware wallets.  I don't know if this is accurate because I would think it wouldn't matter either. 

And after a quick search came across Ledger actually saying its not the best idea: https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165209-Receive-mining-proceeds

[07/14/2021 12:49 AM] Nythain#6769
Interesting


[07/14/2021 12:53 AM] arokace#8057
Yea, I don't really understand why it matters even though it does explain it there.  Maybe it depends on the coin.  Because if I send ergo to a wallet address, even one that hasn't been created/used yet... it's gonna send to it.


[07/14/2021 12:58 AM] Nythain#6769
What i gathered from the post is its mostly a hardware issue trying to comprehend too much at once.


[07/14/2021 1:36 AM] danandbeard#2312
Huh, post made no sense to me...you mine to a single address... there's nothing to construct there


[07/14/2021 1:36 AM] danandbeard#2312
It made it sound like miners are mining to a bunch of addresses, which maybe that's the case with other coins?  Sounds unlikely


[07/14/2021 1:40 AM] arokace#8057
I'm assuming why I don't understand it is because of a lack of knowledge on how hardware wallets work to begin with.  Say ledger had ergo already, it isn't like its running a full node on that little thing let alone competing with all the other coins you might have activated.  But it has to be running some kind of node though.  I still don't understand why a lot of transactions would screw that up but I'm thinking it has something to do with that


[07/14/2021 1:48 AM] danandbeard#2312
I mean I just assumed a hardware wallet was nothing more than they keys to your wallet with accompanying software that did w.e. syncing necessary


[07/14/2021 1:48 AM] danandbeard#2312
I don't know how it could be anything other than that


[07/14/2021 1:49 AM] danandbeard#2312
further, to create a transaction you simply need sign with your key and post that transaction to mempool - so no syncing involved there either - I would assume most hardware wallets probably have an online component that keeps your data up to date without having to sync much locally


[07/14/2021 1:51 AM] danandbeard#2312
yeah, looks like ledger is just a bluetooth dongle with private keys...wtf is it talking about "constructing transactions"?


[07/14/2021 1:52 AM] danandbeard#2312
weird.


[07/14/2021 1:54 AM] arokace#8057
I know Trezor has an online component and some people don't like that because its not a true cold wallet.


[07/14/2021 1:54 AM] arokace#8057
Ledger I think used to or still is a true cold hardware wallet though.  With no online component


[07/14/2021 1:55 AM] Nythain#6769
Fancy


[07/14/2021 1:56 AM] danandbeard#2312
right, but the key connects to software with an online component I imagine


[07/14/2021 1:56 AM] arokace#8057
maybe its literally just their software... ugh, I really can't wrap my head around why.  Maybe its an old article... nope it says that same thing on their most recent wallet too..


[07/14/2021 1:57 AM] danandbeard#2312
really makes me question how much ledger understands their own product LOL


[07/14/2021 1:59 AM] arokace#8057
The only other thing that's crossed my mind is that since hardware wallets are suppose to be the "be all end all of crypto wallet security" that they do some extra security shit, like verifying and stuff on every transaction that comes to that wallet address.


[07/14/2021 2:00 AM] danandbeard#2312
I don't think that's really possible....transactions are completely decoupled from their hardware wallet - it's entirely on the blockchain....nothing ledger could do to prevent anything


[07/14/2021 2:00 AM] danandbeard#2312
like if somebody has copied your keys - there's literally nothing ledger can do about that


[07/14/2021 2:01 AM] danandbeard#2312
like they could monitor the blockchain for transactions that they didn't initiate and email you I guess?


[07/14/2021 2:01 AM] danandbeard#2312
but that's not gonna really help - because any thief competent enough to steal your keys will move all coins in 1 transaction :p


[07/14/2021 2:01 AM] arokace#8057
And the article talks as if us miners are sending 10s,100s are transactions a day.  At best we are sending one to it


[07/14/2021 2:02 AM] danandbeard#2312
makes me wonder if they were just getting spammed with miners freaking out when pools weren't paying their fees so they made some shit up LOL


[07/14/2021 2:02 AM] arokace#8057
this doesn't happen with mining

[07/14/2021 2:03 AM] danandbeard#2312
well I guess some really privacy conscious person might split a bunch of tx's up, but I mean either way the hardware wallet is literally just a read only private key LOL

my stable settings are all over the place, took forever to get it stable and happy bc 12 cards - but i havent had to mess with it all week. if the cards responded to commanded core better it would be easier, but the output doesnt always follow the input so its a lot of back and forth with amd-info (since the miner will lie to you)

What is the deal with mobos with no integrated GPU? Can I use a GPU with a display port to install OS, setup remote access, then take the card out and swap it for cards with no display ports and get back in via RDP? Am I being crazy?

I'll just get cards with display ports actually. Would be a nightmare in the odd case you actually need to plug a monitor in.


[07/14/2021 1:18 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
This is what we will be working with, only blower type cards will do due to the shroud design, can't have hot air building up in there too much or it will get sucked through the north bridge and cpus.

[07/14/2021 2:30 PM] ASCiiDiTY#3647
Yeah will use one for the two cards, but can't go any further than that. Cards need to be no more than 70w pull really.

add it to your minimum payout. current_balance + unconfirmed


[07/15/2021 8:58 AM] Camellia#0001
so I make the minimum payout 2.105?


[07/15/2021 8:58 AM] Camellia#0001
because it seems the confirmed balance only gets paid out


[07/15/2021 8:58 AM] andee#4722
if you current balance is exactly 2, yes


[07/15/2021 8:58 AM] Licklobster#5542
switch pools


[07/15/2021 8:58 AM] Licklobster#5542
and then lower your payout


[07/15/2021 8:58 AM] Licklobster#5542
after all of your balance is confirmed


[07/15/2021 8:59 AM] Licklobster#5542

nanopool needs a certain rating to be able to change payout I think


[07/15/2021 8:59 AM] andee#4722
much easier to just set balance + unconfirmed as payout threshold

[07/15/2021 10:57 PM] danandbeard#2312
done - man pretty crazy how they put ergo on nicehash with less hash than their blog post states would compromise ergo...


[07/15/2021 10:58 PM] danandbeard#2312
literally all they would have to do to appease probably 99% of their clients without compromising coins would be to run a proxy for small nethash coins and whitelist pools


[07/15/2021 10:59 PM] danandbeard#2312
which of course is a decent chunk of work on their part, but like do you really want a malicious nicehash user fucking over ergo or some other coin and having a shit reputation in the crypto community?  can't be a good business move long-term


[07/15/2021 11:03 PM] danandbeard#2312
actually wouldn't even need a proxy since the malicious users aren't miners - the miners wouldn't mess with the intended use of nicehash so just whitelisting on the server would be hella simple - like a week long task at most


[07/15/2021 11:05 PM] danandbeard#2312
but I guess that would kill one legit usecase like oliver was using it for to put hash behind his startup pool to get some decently reliable blocks mined

[07/20/2021 9:12 PM] danandbeard#2312
your DNS resolution is broken - that should work, but it isn't a long term solution


[07/20/2021 9:12 PM] danandbeard#2312
you need to fix your dns resolver

fuck. networking is not my strength


[07/20/2021 9:13 PM] danandbeard#2312
yes, you have internet access, but your DNS isn't resolving that address for w.e. reason


[07/20/2021 9:13 PM] danandbeard#2312
I've given you a herominer IP address so you can copy/paste that and it should work until you figure out your DNS issues


[07/20/2021 9:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
u won‚Äôt believe this. but it won‚Äôt connect to that either.


[07/20/2021 9:14 PM] andee#4722
replace ISP DNS, I use cloudflare 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1


[07/20/2021 9:14 PM] danandbeard#2312
the reason it isn't a long term solution is that every now and then internet facing hosts will move to different servers or refresh their IPs as they expect people to use DNS to find their IP rather than use a static IP


[07/20/2021 9:15 PM] danandbeard#2312
`stratum+tcp://157.90.208.142:10250` should work though

looks like you're resolving IP just fine


[07/20/2021 9:20 PM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
can you do telnet herominers.com:10250

yeah, ping times out, but IP is still resolved you can see in your terminal it finds the IP

ICMPs?

`ncat ergo.herominers.com 10250`

I wouldn't wait more than 15 minutes...in the meantime just mine to woolypooly/coinfoundry/leafpool if I were you


[07/20/2021 9:22 PM] andee#4722

[07/20/2021 9:22 PM] danandbeard#2312

`nbminer -a ergo -o stratum+tcp://pool.coinfoundry.org:3036  -u <your wallet here>` could try this for a few minutes just to sanity check your miner/card is setup correctly


[07/20/2021 9:26 PM] danandbeard#2312
that's coinfoundry (a different new pool with low hashrate right now)


[07/20/2021 9:27 PM] danandbeard#2312
watch thsi lurker put up 3 shares and then mine a block immediately on coinfoundry LOL

[07/20/2021 9:29 PM] andee#4722
you would be cool if you stayed around, its a new pool. blocks takes some time, but you get bigger payouts. on average it will be the same, unless you are the one finding the block üôÇ

[07/20/2021 9:30 PM] danandbeard#2312
yeah, coinfoundry has enough hashrate that you should see roughly the same payout there as herominer over the course of a few weeks, but with low hashrate comes a lot more luck/volatility


[07/20/2021 9:31 PM] danandbeard#2312
interesting...try this `nbminer --verbose -a ergo -o stratum+tcp://pool.coinfoundry.org:3036  -u <your wallet here>`


[07/20/2021 9:31 PM] danandbeard#2312

[07/20/2021 9:39 PM] danandbeard#2312
yeah, never flash the standard bios, only flash the OC bios...they have switches - checkout the manual to see which position is which...some have three positions


[07/20/2021 9:40 PM] danandbeard#2312
keeping the standard bios in tact can save you a lot of pain when you accidentally brick your OC bios

also, this is just a shot in the dark but for the algorithm flag `-a ergo` do instead `-a autolykos2` just for kicks and giggles

[07/21/2021 1:15 AM] danandbeard#2312
another thought: are you copy/pasting your wallet?  try typing every single character - you might be copying from somewhere that has some weird ass character encoding that's breaking shit in unexpected ways?


[07/21/2021 1:15 AM] danandbeard#2312
again though - just throwing shit at a wall at this point


[07/21/2021 1:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
lol i‚Äôll try. But if that wallet address worked on your machine, it should on mine


[07/21/2021 1:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
It would cause same error no?


[07/21/2021 2:09 AM] danandbeard#2312
not necessarily, but probably


[07/21/2021 2:09 AM] danandbeard#2312
weird character encodings could get stripped by discord...so if you copy/paste what you put in discord you should have the same input as I have


[07/21/2021 2:15 AM] Deleted User#0000

what is TLS disabled? could that be issue?


[07/21/2021 2:44 AM] danandbeard#2312
show me full command you're executing


[07/21/2021 2:44 AM] danandbeard#2312
avoid tls if possible anyways - lets try to connect to stratum+tcp first and then later if you're brave you can try for stratum+ssl


[07/21/2021 2:45 AM] danandbeard#2312
on most machines they are equally easy, but you've got some unique issues going on

I think their min. payout is 1 ERG - so go to https://ergo.herominers.com/ and you'll see a field to enter your wallet and it'll tell you how much you've earned

once you hit min. payout (default is 1ERG you can change that though) it takes maybe an hour or so?  I forget how often they payout

If anyone can help, I have a 700W powersupply that is powering 3 cards. 3070, 1080ti & RX570. At the moment the 570 keeps dying after about 20 minutes of mining. Anyone have advice. Attached is all the detail.

[07/21/2021 5:09 AM] Camellia#0001
That sounds like the cards are starved for power


[07/21/2021 5:10 AM] Camellia#0001
My personal rule is the PSU needs to power the cards without issue *before* tuning


[07/21/2021 5:13 AM] HaychAU#7544
Shouldn't 700W be enough or am I calculating it wrong?


[07/21/2021 5:13 AM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
What about CPU and MB?


[07/21/2021 5:14 AM] HaychAU#7544
Isn't that calculated in the HIVEOS figure above?


[07/21/2021 5:14 AM] HaychAU#7544
125w + 130w for the 2 cards


[07/21/2021 5:14 AM] HaychAU#7544
without the 3rd card

[07/21/2021 5:56 AM] WeeklyOptions#5401
2 , 750 W psu‚Äôs should be good for 6 cards right? They are Vega 56‚Äôs


[07/21/2021 10:45 AM] danandbeard#2312
should be enough to power them, might not be optimal efficiency though


[07/21/2021 10:46 AM] danandbeard#2312
presumably 1 of those is handling 3 cards + mobo/cpu so depends on those variables, but I believe OC'd vega 56s pull something like 200-220w at the wall


[07/21/2021 11:15 AM] burnysizzz#0822
my oc Vegas pull around 200w if I want 200mh


[07/21/2021 11:43 AM] danandbeard#2312
at the wall or software reported?

these are great i use them also


[07/21/2021 5:45 PM] Marty#4039
You aren't supposed to say each card is 200 and the cpu/MOBO is 150, so that equals 750w which your ps can handle. It doesn't work that way

Rule of thumb is half of the power supply rating can be consistently maintained


[07/21/2021 5:45 PM] Marty#4039
There will always be power spikes and the ps won't run 100% efficiency at all times


[07/21/2021 5:47 PM] Marty#4039
You're already at 600w or so for the cards and that doesn't count the MOBO and everything else. You need at least a 1000w ps to handle this load. You can't just go right up to the number because the ps won't always output exactly 1000w.


[07/21/2021 5:47 PM] Marty#4039
Or 700w in your case


[07/21/2021 5:51 PM] danandbeard#2312
since I'm upgrading to 240v line a PDU with amperage reporting isn't hard to come by for semi-cheap but thanks for the suggestion!


[07/22/2021 10:07 AM] WINNI#3324
is there anyway to show the real wattusage of each card in hiveos? currently the system draws 800W  in Hiveos but 1.190W from Wall. id like to controll those stats and min/max with other cards


[07/22/2021 12:51 PM] danandbeard#2312
Not without external tools, no.


[07/22/2021 12:53 PM] danandbeard#2312
There are some PDUs that can report over a network that could possibly be useful there, though


[07/22/2021 1:37 PM] WINNI#3324
ok, thanks!


[07/22/2021 5:05 PM] r3drud#6083
Any tips or suggestions on a couple cards by anyone. Using HiveOS, two cards being a pain. EVGA 3060 rev1 card, the most stable setting is 0 core, 1395 mem, and PL 125 at 65 mh. The second card EVGA 3060Ti rev2, most stable setting is -200 core, 1500 mem, 135PL at 84mh. Using 465.31 drivers. Was using the 460 drivers and that was worse.


[07/22/2021 5:06 PM] r3drud#6083
oh and I've tried nbminer, lolminer and trex. nbminer has been the least problematic


[07/22/2021 6:23 PM] r3drud#6083
0 core, 0 mem I can get 102 mh on the 3060. 3060Ti is being a pain however


[07/22/2021 6:29 PM] Canberry#7404
PL 125%? you should lower not raise


[07/22/2021 6:54 PM] r3drud#6083
i have it down to 115 now


[07/22/2021 8:04 PM] Canberry#7404
i mean lower under 100%


[07/22/2021 8:20 PM] r3drud#6083
How do you assign PL percentages in HiveOS?


[07/22/2021 8:45 PM] Camellia#0001
You assign wattage limits

First time running HiveOS and while it's fairly intuitive, it's been a bit of a challenge.


[07/22/2021 10:21 PM] Pharotek#2932
you should be okay for power for just those 3 cards, do this, either back the core from 1150 to 1100 or CVdd go up to 930. Some of my 580 I had bump corPower up a little from others.


[07/22/2021 10:26 PM] HaychAU#7544
Thanks I got a second PSU and I'm still having issue with it. I think the mb has an issue. I'm gonna try something different

use the Gdoc of what others are using it's pin in mining channel

I think the general consensus is that basically all pools are good.  CF has more than enough hashrate for stable ish payout at this point.  I wouldn't say there's any real reason to move from any pool except nanopool which no one should be using


[07/23/2021 1:08 PM] danandbeard#2312
(until nanopool drops below 50% of nethash then nanopool is greta's well)

_sighs at this, but doesn't say anything, because the correct way to do it (simply changing voltage) seems to be above most miners' heads._


[07/23/2021 3:06 PM] Erazor#9864
The one thing that bothers me with Ergo as a pool op is the insanely long confirmation times. You basically have to fund the pool with multiple block rewards to satisfy today's impatient miners. Did that for one block, but that's not nearly enough for the current hashrate.


[07/23/2021 3:22 PM] danandbeard#2312
I can understand the frustration, but miners are your customers - I don't think anyone gets very far asking people to want their money later rather than sooner - the reality is that money in my hand today is worth more than money in my hand tomorrow

[07/23/2021 3:51 PM] Canberry#7404
if the difference is inconsequential then it is impatience. 
I don‚Äôt think a lot of miners care about the health and growth of the platform and instead only view crypto as an easy way to make money


[07/23/2021 3:52 PM] Canberry#7404
which it can be, but pool/algo hopping and wanting payouts a few hours quicker at the expense of people who run the pools and the platform altogether isn‚Äôt good imo


[07/23/2021 3:58 PM] Pharotek#2932
anyone on Coinfoundry have suggestions for Vega 56 Settings. My TeamRed settings with tweaks are not working the same


[07/23/2021 3:59 PM] Pharotek#2932
nvm i figured it out


[07/23/2021 4:05 PM] danandbeard#2312
let's say you're just getting into mining and you estimate one pool will have $100 or returns and the other will have $100.01 - which pool are you choosing?


[07/23/2021 4:08 PM] danandbeard#2312
for me I'm choosing the one with 1 penny more - it's not a big deal, but I don't owe ergo or ergo pools anything and I don't feel bad about chasing profit either.  I think everyone should chase profit as hard as they can until they are financially independent.  I'm of the philosophy that people can't truly help each other until they help themselves, which to me means that financial independence is the first goal and then once you get there you can live a much happier life by helping everyone else


[07/23/2021 4:09 PM] danandbeard#2312
that decision in isolation doesn't matter, but in aggregate optimizations can add up


[07/23/2021 4:09 PM] andee#4722
if the $100 one had a better UI, would you still choose the marginally more profitable one?


[07/23/2021 4:10 PM] Canberry#7404
I would choose based upon UI, pool size, community of each pool, etc. that‚Äôs a completely inconsequential difference and you‚Äôd save more by skipping out on starbucks. 
my point isn‚Äôt that chasing profit is bad, I specifically said that wanting money is fine, but harming the platform over it isn‚Äôt ok


[07/23/2021 4:10 PM] danandbeard#2312
maybe?  I've never changed pools based on UI, but I can imagine I might


[07/23/2021 4:11 PM] danandbeard#2312
sorry, I was elaborating on my philosophy I can see how that would seem like I was suggesting we have different philosophies


[07/23/2021 4:13 PM] Herk#6019
I would imagine most people just getting into crypto will go with the one paying more, even if by .01


[07/23/2021 4:16 PM] andee#4722
if I knew one pool was more profitable, I would chosen that pool too. but for a .01 difference I wouldn't take the time to change the rigs over, if we were talking several percentages of certain profits, sure


[07/23/2021 4:18 PM] TooDegenToQuit#6623
Agree! People get into crypto to make money. they invest with the sole intention of making a profit. Half or more do not even know how crypto work or the purpose of it. It is all about the money!


[07/23/2021 4:18 PM] Herk#6019

But 1 PSU has 2 Vegas and the mother board


[07/24/2021 12:47 AM] WeeklyOptions#5401
Other PSU has 3 Vegas


[07/24/2021 12:48 AM] Camellia#0001
750 watts probably isn‚Äôt enough for 3 Vegas


[07/24/2021 12:51 AM] WeeklyOptions#5401
Why ? Vegas will do what 150-200 watts each?


[07/24/2021 12:56 AM] Camellia#0001
If you have them set to run for speed, they‚Äôll be drawing ~200-210 each, which is about 80% of your PSU,


[07/24/2021 12:57 AM] Canberry#7404
80% PSU usage shouldnt shut it off


[07/24/2021 12:58 AM] WeeklyOptions#5401
Right I‚Äôm thinking it should be fine


[07/24/2021 12:59 AM] WeeklyOptions#5401
How many mega hashes should I expect? Near 200 right?


[07/24/2021 12:59 AM] Canberry#7404
for max hashrate each should do around 200 yeah


[07/24/2021 1:02 AM] Camellia#0001
But it‚Äôs less than ideal for extended periods of time


[07/24/2021 1:02 AM] Canberry#7404
sure, but not 5 minutes


[07/24/2021 1:02 AM] Camellia#0001
I run my PSUs closer to 50-60


[07/24/2021 1:31 AM] TooDegenToQuit#6623
running conservative 750 is enough

3070 TIi OC recommendations?
By adding more power the card is more stable, where at 140-150 watts it couldn't maintain its hashrate and dropped to 105-120 mhs, now it is still lagging.
Also my temps are starting to his 71 Celsius, should I increase the fan speed?

I paid something like $180 each set including cables.


[07/24/2021 3:16 PM] AeonRemnant#3905
You end up paying around the same amount for the 750W units, may as well over double your theoretical capacity if the alternative is saving $40 per PSU. :P


[07/24/2021 5:48 PM] WeeklyOptions#5401
Right but my thinking is on a 120v you can only pull like 1440 max 80% of the full. So that‚Äôs why I went the 2 750‚Äôs


[07/24/2021 5:48 PM] WeeklyOptions#5401
If I had a 220-240V I woulda gone higher

How hot can these AMD Vegas run? And what‚Äôs an ok range temp wise?


[07/25/2021 2:10 AM] Galactus#2156
I got the 3070 Ti up with more power, but it does consume more than the regular Ti's, plus it is quite sensitive to OC settings. 
The EVGA 3070 goes on its merry way, without needing to use the fan. Thing is impressive.

[07/27/2021 2:55 AM] Galactus#2156
Why is my rig crashing all of a sudden? I'm using HiveOS and learning the basic commands from setting up and basic troubleshooting is quite hard, because there are no detailed noted


[07/27/2021 3:34 AM] Camellia#0001
Can‚Äôt work on devices usually means an overclock is unstable


[07/27/2021 3:36 AM] Galactus#2156
So how do I check which one? I suspect it‚Äôs the 3080 ti. I‚Äôve set up logs on HiveOS but can work out how to get the info I need


[07/27/2021 5:32 AM] MrTon#1850
why -500? try -100 on your 3070's or increase power


[07/27/2021 5:40 AM] Canberry#7404
170MH/130W is legit

Try nbminer instead of Nanominer.


[07/27/2021 6:46 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
I've found NB to be a LOT more stable.


[07/27/2021 6:47 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Also be sure to run the hive kernel update. 
```hive-replace -y --stable```


[07/27/2021 11:41 AM] Terremot#4855
I get 174 mhs on 131W


[07/27/2021 11:53 AM] Muessig#0272
I've never had any issues with nbminer


[07/27/2021 1:37 PM] Galactus#2156
I am on the most recent kernal of 0.6-206@210723.
At what point can I switch mining pool, should I wait for my payout?
My temps are continuously running between 67-71c, but my fans are always at sub 50%, even though I allow them to get at either 75% or 100%, how do I force them to "wake up"?


[07/27/2021 1:38 PM] AeonRemnant#3905
Yeah uhh. The mining pool thing depends on the pool itself.


[07/27/2021 1:38 PM] Galactus#2156
I will try lifting the core a bit tonight, thanks


[07/27/2021 1:38 PM] AeonRemnant#3905
Have you reached minimum payout yet? Will you get paid eventually regardless of minimum payout reached, etc?


[07/27/2021 1:39 PM] AeonRemnant#3905
As for the fans? Under OC settings simply set the fan speed to a percentage. 65% is good.


[07/27/2021 1:39 PM] Galactus#2156
No payout since update to 720 blocks. 2.6 ergo balance, and 2.7 ergo unconfirmed


[07/27/2021 1:41 PM] Galactus#2156
I've tried, but they are still running hotter than what I would like

Card #2 is bugged, 0% speed. Check your connections.


[07/27/2021 1:41 PM] AeonRemnant#3905
Card #4 looks alright.


[07/27/2021 1:42 PM] AeonRemnant#3905
Cards #1 and #3 are a little weird, but they don't look in any real danger.


[07/27/2021 1:42 PM] AeonRemnant#3905
Show me the settings in your OC panel.


[07/27/2021 1:45 PM] AeonRemnant#3905
And uhh, apparently they're a wee bit bugged.


[07/27/2021 1:45 PM] AeonRemnant#3905
So I'd go ahead and reseat all the cards to start with.


[07/27/2021 1:49 PM] Galactus#2156

Connections are good. By resetting the cards you mean reboot the rig?


[07/27/2021 1:51 PM] AeonRemnant#3905
I mean take the cards out of the risers and put them back in.


[07/27/2021 1:55 PM] Galactus#2156
Ok - that's been done before a couple of time. Any other settings to look at within hive?


[07/27/2021 2:25 PM] Herk#6019
reduce the oc


[07/27/2021 2:30 PM] Herk#6019
but I'm biased, I like my cards efficient since kwh is expensive over here also don't want to worry about them


[07/27/2021 3:18 PM] Galactus#2156

[07/27/2021 3:26 PM] Herk#6019
you can do the same on the 3070ti's apparently


[07/27/2021 3:58 PM] Galactus#2156
Thanks Herk, I'll see how these go. I don't mind a slight drop in hashrate if it stays stable. The EVGA card still isn't using its fans.

your 3070ti should be around 140W


[07/27/2021 4:04 PM] Herk#6019
again slightly lower hashrate (similar to the non-lhr 3070's) but if you're paying for electricity it's worth it


[07/27/2021 4:05 PM] Herk#6019
I don't have the 70ti and 80ti's but @intuit seems to run them on those settings (1500/2400 and 1500/2200 as far as I can recall)

[07/30/2021 7:35 PM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
@MArkFIA You mean my settings. I've since updated them a bit but the purpose of the 54% PL was just to have the minimum amount of power to maintain a stable core clock at ~1000.

After trying a whole lot of settings, I've found there's very little that actually matters besides having the highest possible stable memory OC. In my case, that's a paltry +900. Point is every post I've seen suggests the 3060 Ti LHR will only do about 130 Mh/s


[07/30/2021 7:39 PM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
You should also see a small improvement if you lock the clock/voltage. My final settings are locked core at 1020 MHz and 706 mV, +900 memory. I had to reduce the memory OC from the initial +950 because I was getting crashes after a while.

I'm now getting 130.1 Mh/s at 107 W

because my stratum does not kick u yet when u give repeated invalids


[08/03/2021 2:39 PM] ProSavage#7131
it's still the miner's fault that they're invalid.
If it was stratum everyone would be screaming invalid.


[08/03/2021 2:39 PM] ProSavage#7131
stratums can kick on invalid forcing u to rebuild and recalc - generally fixes it. Or a manual restart.

Just want to mention, if anyone here is mining on nanopool you should switch to a different pool. Nano has 55% of the network hashrate right now and could attack the network if they wanted to

[08/05/2021 1:47 AM] Shol#2900
Hey guys, in need of some advice. I wanted to see how much I could get out of an old AMD Radeon R7 450 with  3GB memory. It's a crap card, but it's just for fun anyway. Only a few miners recognized it, and I was able to get it working on Nanominer for around 8 MHs. For some reason though, all of the shares are "rejected" and the message I receive is "Share denied: low difficulty share."I have tried underclocking and that does not resolve the issue. The address that it's mining is definitely the correct one. Any ideas?


[08/05/2021 2:42 AM] MrTon#1850

@MrTon thanks for the response. I have tried nano, hero, and wooly, all of which give only rejected shares. on wooly I get "share denied: low difficulty share:(6) minimum is 4000000000" and on hero I get "Share denied: invalid share."


[08/05/2021 4:05 AM] TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337
try 2 miners?


[08/05/2021 4:05 AM] TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337
they use 8.72GH share difficulty


[08/05/2021 4:05 AM] MrTon#1850
weird I thought wooly hae 3 GH diff setting


[08/05/2021 4:06 AM] TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337
hero the difficulty of the sharesz changes


[08/05/2021 4:06 AM] TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337
minimum is 4GH iirc


[08/05/2021 4:07 AM] MrTon#1850
try https://enigmapool.com/ ?


[08/05/2021 4:50 AM] Shol#2900
just tried engima pool and same thing, "share denied: low difficulty share." any other possible options?


[08/05/2021 9:12 AM] andee#4722
I think coinfoundry has 1G minimum


[08/05/2021 12:53 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Tried a different coin for testing?


[08/05/2021 12:53 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Try on kawpow or some other algo


[08/05/2021 6:46 PM] Shol#2900
the card has successfully mined etc, ubq, and vtc


[08/05/2021 6:52 PM] Shol#2900
@andee thanks for recommendation. Seems like their difficulty is lower but it's the only pool i'm having issues connecting with. when trying to connect, I just get spammed with "Ergo: trying to use "stratum" mining protocol... to disable this behaviour, specificy: protocol=JSON-RPC." When I use this protocol it reconnects and connects forever. this is on both ports btw


[08/05/2021 6:59 PM] Nythain#6769
so "share denied" will randomly happen on at least a couple pools. nothing to be too worried about unless it's every share. woolypooly min share diff is 3g, many others 4g, didn't know cf was 1g? that's awesome, and a couple can be as high as 8g


[08/05/2021 7:04 PM] Shol#2900
@Nythainthanks for the reply. it's literally every share. I will try wooly again with that 3g diff for longer and see if any get through, thanks. and still having issues with connecting to cf, tried on another pc as well with same messages and no luck


[08/05/2021 7:06 PM] Nythain#6769
if the problem persists on wooly, check out hero if you haven't already. min share diff is 4g variable up to whatever. 4g hurts if you're really low hashrate but it's nothing if you have more than like, 30MH/s lol


[08/05/2021 7:09 PM] Nythain#6769
@Shol also just confirmed enigmapool is static 4g so also an option though the block times are a bit longer than other pools since they're new (rewards average out, just takes a little longer to see them lol)


[08/05/2021 7:15 PM] Shol#2900
@Nythain haha well the card is a r7 450 3gb that gets about 8mh/s, a lot less than 30 :P. and seems like when I start wooly on miner it says share difficulty=4 gh


[08/05/2021 7:19 PM] TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337
yeah tbh i dont think your card is able to produce shares fast enough maybe?


[08/05/2021 7:19 PM] TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337
idk


[08/05/2021 7:19 PM] TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337
just a hunch


[08/05/2021 7:20 PM] TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337
are you paying for electricity? if you are it probably isnt worth using an 8MH/s card


[08/05/2021 7:22 PM] TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337
sell the card to a gamer who needs it and buy a 580/570/480/470 4gb for mining :hehehe:


[08/05/2021 7:24 PM] Nythain#6769
Ok, sorry i can't help ya more


[08/05/2021 7:24 PM] Shol#2900
haha i have a full rig of 30x stuff, this is more for fun as hobby on a couple old crap cards. yeah maybe the cards just simply cant go quick enough, but i'd like to be able to try cf pool before calling it. they run fine on etc, ubq, vtc


[08/05/2021 7:25 PM] TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337
hmm if it works on other coins its weird that its having issues on erg


[08/05/2021 7:25 PM] TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337

[08/05/2021 8:55 PM] Shol#2900
seems like nanominer just won't connect to coinfoundry. tried on another pc, could get there with t-rex but on nanominer it always fails. maybe because the miner doesn't allow "stratum+tcp://" before the pool? (for example pool1=ergo-us.leafpool.com:1111 works, but if stratum+tcp:// is included it auto selects nanopool). sadly nanominer is the only ergo miner that can mine the card


[08/05/2021 9:00 PM] Nythain#6769
ugh, use a different miner. aren't nanominers fees even higher than the alternatives?


[08/05/2021 9:01 PM] Shol#2900
@Nythain ive tried srb, teamred, and nb. all can detect the cards but cant mine them lol, nanominer is the only one i've had luck with (i use t-rex on main cards)


[08/05/2021 9:02 PM] Shol#2900
gminer/phoenix were able to mine etc/ubq, but they dont have autolykos so nano is all thats left (unless theres another miner i've missed)


[08/05/2021 9:03 PM] Nythain#6769
oh yeah, you got the ancient 3gb


[08/05/2021 9:03 PM] Nythain#6769
forgot about that


[08/05/2021 9:03 PM] Nythain#6769
that is where nanominer shines


[08/05/2021 9:04 PM] TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337
i use nanominer just because it supports both nvda and amd cards


[08/05/2021 9:04 PM] Nythain#6769
t-rex supports both now doesn't it?


[08/05/2021 9:05 PM] Shol#2900
@TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã i believe NBMiner also does both amd and nvda, maybe something to look at. pretty sure t-rex is still nvidia only?


[08/05/2021 9:06 PM] TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337
hmm i should look into switching


[08/05/2021 9:06 PM] TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337
i just dont wanna shut my rig down when difficulty is this low


[08/05/2021 9:06 PM] TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337
lol


[08/05/2021 9:07 PM] Nythain#6769
I cant rememer which new erg miner it was that supports both, too any choices lol. Im nvidia so nb for me


[08/05/2021 9:09 PM] Shol#2900
haha yeah so many choices, yet it seems like only nano will support that card üò¶ and i'm not ready to admit defeat yet haha


[08/05/2021 9:09 PM] TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337
on my pc i have amd and nvda and in my rig i have just amd


[08/05/2021 9:11 PM] Nythain#6769
yeah, stick with it. nano is the only one that will. same with the old nvidia 9xx cards (which in compute mode actually produce upwards of 20 MH/s)


[08/05/2021 9:19 PM] Shol#2900
@Nythain im not as familiar with amd cards so i just looked up turning on compute mode and the section of "GPU Workload" in the AMD program isn't there. maybe this card is too old for that üòÜ


[08/05/2021 9:19 PM] TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337

[08/05/2021 9:20 PM] Nythain#6769
yeah, not all cards support it. mostly for enterprise purposes.


[08/05/2021 9:28 PM] Shol#2900
@Nythain @TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã thanks so much for all the ideas, i think the only option is to find a way to make coinfoundry and nanominer work together, so i'll contact them both asking for ideas. thanks guys appreciate it :jrabraBottle:


[08/05/2021 9:29 PM] Nythain#6769
in theory you should be able to just ditch the stratum+tcp... ```If you would like to bypass GeoIP routing entirely, feel free to use either pool-eu.coinfoundry.org, pool-us.coinfoundry.org or pool-asia.coinfoundry.org as hostname.```


[08/05/2021 9:35 PM] Shol#2900
tried both na and eu, both 3036 and 3136, get this continuous spam. if i follow what it says and change protocol, it just spams connecting and reconnecting

yeah. well, worth a shot anyways i guess üôÇ


[08/05/2021 9:46 PM] Shol#2900
just to confirm, there is no other pool with lower than 4 gh diff?


[08/05/2021 9:48 PM] Nythain#6769
not that i know of. if you find another let me know, my 1050ti doesn't do so good at 4g and higher


[08/05/2021 9:48 PM] Shol#2900
how is your reject % with it on 4g?


[08/05/2021 9:50 PM] Nythain#6769
i don't get many/any rejects aside of the occasional stales due to latency. my biggest issue is actually getting submittable shares


[08/05/2021 9:50 PM] Nythain#6769
at 4g could go 10-20 minutes without a share at 27MH/s


[08/05/2021 9:51 PM] Nythain#6769
and now i poof to flee work


[08/05/2021 9:51 PM] Shol#2900

Anyone know what the optimal settings for 3070s and 1080s are? I'm pushing 170 on the 3070s and 47 on the 1080 which doesn't seem right.


[08/06/2021 8:17 AM] where_cookie#3129
3070 is accurate


[08/06/2021 8:17 AM] where_cookie#3129

[08/06/2021 1:40 PM] Salu#0001
yeah nanopool


[08/06/2021 1:40 PM] Salu#0001
meaning somone reported the same share before me?


[08/06/2021 1:41 PM] Salu#0001
how do stale shares work exactly?


[08/06/2021 1:42 PM] trex#6765
No, the miner found a solution and submitted it, but by the time it arrived to the pool, the pool had moved onto the new block effectively making that share stale


[08/06/2021 1:43 PM] Salu#0001
i see, fascinating

Just wait until the ethereum tweakers come along, remember that the 1080 & 1080ti were pretty bad for eth until the memtweaks & ethlargement came out

But it will unexpectedly later for no reason


[08/06/2021 5:37 PM] andee#4722
make the miner save logs with a debug flag if available and then let it run until it happens


[08/06/2021 5:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
How do you do that?


[08/06/2021 5:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
What do I type for trex


[08/06/2021 5:38 PM] andee#4722
`    -l, --log-path                 Full path of the log file.`


[08/06/2021 5:40 PM] rexthefex#1218
yeah true, but 2080ti should be at least slightly better than 1080ti, not the same


[08/06/2021 5:44 PM] MrFreeze#0650
2080ti get's 123-160 mh


[08/06/2021 5:44 PM] Nythain#6769
True, looks like 1080ti can push 100 while 2080ti can do 120ish


[08/06/2021 5:44 PM] MrFreeze#0650
123mh with 120w


[08/06/2021 5:44 PM] MrFreeze#0650
2080ti


[08/06/2021 5:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
By full path would that be the path for logs in like some sort of document

how are people getting 70mh with 1070?


[08/06/2021 6:08 PM] rexthefex#1218
have you got any offset enabled or just locking 1100mhz?


[08/06/2021 6:09 PM] rexthefex#1218
managed to get slightly more hashes by increasing memory, but that's about it


[08/06/2021 6:09 PM] rexthefex#1218
can't go lower than 140w otherwise the hash drops


[08/06/2021 6:09 PM] MrFreeze#0650
been working so not had chance messing with the overclocks yet


[08/06/2021 6:10 PM] rexthefex#1218

And the spacing


[08/06/2021 6:18 PM] Nythain#6769
Unless -l is to enable logging and --log-path says where but still shouldnt need a comma.

[08/06/2021 6:22 PM] Mitschud#7387
I am pretty much new to mining, currently using nicehash with daggerhashimoto and trex, getting 33.40mhs on mobile 2060 (lm'd so no thermal damage is inbound) and I want to go into pool mining with ergo (autolykos). I've set up android wallet, but I still dont know how would I withdraw the mined ergo to my bank account


[08/06/2021 6:23 PM] Mitschud#7387
Also I am pretty lost overall


[08/06/2021 6:23 PM] MrFreeze#0650
You transfer the ergo to another coin then use something like coinbase to your paypal/bank


[08/06/2021 6:23 PM] Mitschud#7387
How tho


[08/06/2021 6:24 PM] Mitschud#7387
I see send/recieve buttons and some adresses


[08/06/2021 6:24 PM] Mitschud#7387
Where do I get the adress to which I would sent coins


[08/06/2021 6:24 PM] MrFreeze#0650
the recieve address the the address you want to put in the .bat (if on windows)


[08/06/2021 6:24 PM] Mitschud#7387
Oh right, I'm stupid


[08/06/2021 6:25 PM] MrFreeze#0650
then the sender is the address you want to send it to


[08/06/2021 6:25 PM] MrFreeze#0650
üôÇ


[08/06/2021 6:27 PM] Mitschud#7387
So basically I will make coinbase wallet, use its adress as target and the adress from erg wallet will be mined to


[08/06/2021 6:28 PM] MrFreeze#0650
I wouldnt use coinbase as a main wallet due to them change the address after each transfer but they are good for withdraw into account.

[08/06/2021 6:31 PM] Mitschud#7387
I will use erg android wallet as primary wallet since I want to mine only erg (one gpu) and then use coinbase to withdraw


[08/06/2021 6:32 PM] MrFreeze#0650
you will need to exchange the coin to something else for coinbase as they dont support it atm


[08/06/2021 6:34 PM] Mitschud#7387

[08/06/2021 6:34 PM] Mitschud#7387
So basically I have to go thru 3 things to even get my money


[08/06/2021 6:34 PM] Mitschud#7387
Not worth it if I have 1.8‚Ç¨ a day with the shitty gpu I own


[08/06/2021 6:34 PM] MrFreeze#0650

Alright I have to try it
Let me get things straight otherwise my smooth brain wont work


[08/06/2021 6:36 PM] Mitschud#7387
I'll use trex, herominers pool, erg android wallet


[08/06/2021 6:36 PM] Nythain#6769
Its not bad. Could nix a step and just sebd to kucoin, trade for usdt then withdraw?


[08/06/2021 6:36 PM] Zergie#2017
I know your feeling, coinex(erg-> btc -> to coinbase -> sell BTC on market -> get USD/EUR -> paypal -> bank acc


[08/06/2021 6:37 PM] Nythain#6769
Wasnt that part of the appeal of kucoin, a usdt pairing?


[08/06/2021 6:37 PM] Mitschud#7387
Why tf is there so many sercices


[08/06/2021 6:37 PM] TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337
are you going to stay mining 24/7 or do you game occasionally on the card

[08/06/2021 6:38 PM] TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337

[08/06/2021 6:38 PM] Mitschud#7387
But my subzero iq is not cooperating


[08/06/2021 6:38 PM] TheWildJarvi„ÄäTHE SEMI SEER„Äã#1337
if you had another card always mining, and then you were on / off mining with that other card id reccomend a pplns pool over a prop pool


[08/06/2021 6:38 PM] Nythain#6769
Or join leafpool? Their hash is decent and pplns?


[08/06/2021 6:39 PM] Nythain#6769
Depending on card/hashrate, even on off mining pplns might be better


[08/06/2021 6:40 PM] Nythain#6769
Prop is a fickle bitch. But if hash is decent probably better option i agree


[08/06/2021 6:40 PM] Mitschud#7387
Alright, lets just say I want to mine and store erg, not withdraw it till I have like 50‚Ç¨ mined, if I use JUST trex, herominers pool and erg android wallet, will it work ? i mean if this setup is enough and no additional software/service is needed


[08/06/2021 6:40 PM] Nythain#6769
Yes


[08/06/2021 6:40 PM] Mitschud#7387

im using nano miner on my AMD-NVDA rig and i get what i should per card


[08/06/2021 7:14 PM] Nythain#6769
Also make sure any appropriate mem tweaks are being applied

check your stratum server. you are using mainnet address but I think you should receive work anyways

are you connecting directly to node without a stratum server?

I'm running into an issue where GPU 4 reports dead gpu and restarts the miner in teamredminer.  It'll run anywhere from 1 to 24 hours before reporting dead gpu. 
I've tried changing out the pci riser, unplugging pci cable/usb from the motherboard and plugging it back in, increasing VDD, reducing MEM, changing DPM/MDPM from 0-5, removing amdmemtweak. 

Issue also happens on phoenix miner and while mining ETH.

The rig was stable for 14 days on Windows and the issue started after switching to Hive. Any ideas on what else I can try?

I use NBMiner for Nvidia cards and TRM for AMD cards


[08/07/2021 5:18 AM] bbot#6878
I've been using NBMiner prior to t-rex's support of Ergo. I'm curious to know how t-rex performs against NBMiner


[08/07/2021 5:24 AM] massiATTACK#6450
i use T-Rex for ETH didnt tried it for ERGO yet


[08/07/2021 5:25 AM] massiATTACK#6450
still i can say NBminer outperform lolminer for ERGO

make sure you're using the latest version (0.21.5)


[08/07/2021 8:32 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
Yes but LHR does hurt Ergo mining performance. The 3060 Ti and 3070 LHRs all seem to do 130-135 Mh/s, down from the 170 Mh/s or so of the non-LHR cards

what mining software should I use for my Nvidia RTX Geforce 2070 card to mine Ergo?


[08/07/2021 10:24 AM] +LUFFY#1940
2 3070 using TREX and works super well ~170MH/s


[08/07/2021 12:25 PM] Stef#0241
I'm using t-rex on 3060 and it's running good for me, you can put oc settings directly in the miner .bat file so no afterburner required


[08/07/2021 12:26 PM] Stef#0241
But keep in mind it has 2% for autolykos

[08/07/2021 4:45 PM] Nythain#6769
On the ergo network, the dag file gets created with each new job, ie block. This brief time will result in a hash drop while your card is processing that. For ins and outs of what dag and dag file are, all i can say is google.


[08/07/2021 4:52 PM] callie#3352
that's pretty interesting. Let's see ergo become top 2 or top 3 in couple of years probably making 1 ergo = 300 usd or 1 ergo = 1k usd in the near future üòÑ


[08/07/2021 4:55 PM] Nythain#6769
I can easily see erg 100 in a year or two. Possibly more in that timeframe but the organoc growth of erg puts it at a slower pace than a lot of crapcoins which im ok with.


[08/07/2021 5:03 PM] callie#3352
yeah, I don't want to make mistake again when I mine eth last 2016 which only same price of ergo. If I hold that time I can be rich now but not now, I will hold ergo and easily see this become top crypto coin after eth upgraded to london fork eip 1559.


[08/07/2021 5:04 PM] U MAD?#4066
how much eth/100 mh did u make in 2016?


[08/07/2021 5:08 PM] U MAD?#4066
im just trying to put things in perspective since I'm a new miner


[08/07/2021 5:10 PM] Nythain#6769
From a veteran miner to a new miner, if you find a coin you can mine and the project is solid or you like it... HODL. Dont be one of us that blew or lost our coins years ago and regret not being millionares now lol.


[08/07/2021 5:11 PM] callie#3352
for what I remember I mine 100mhs/0.5 eth that time. Not sure if that's correct. I already forgot it, But I remember that eth is only 8 to 12 dollars that time.


[08/07/2021 5:13 PM] U MAD?#4066
thanks! that's what I'm planning to do!


[08/07/2021 5:13 PM] U MAD?#4066

i remember in 2015 going to a friend of a friend house and this guy was mining btc in his living room with 30+ gpus. I asked him all the basic stuff about it but at that time it seemed so crazy to me. I think he sold all his btc than bcz hes not rich now...


[08/07/2021 5:23 PM] callie#3352
that's sad. That's happen to me too. So if you want to be rich, hold is the key and you can do it now for Ergo. Large exchange listing also for ego like kucoin now.

HEy guys, quick question.
Today i stopped mining for a few minutes to change my payout wallet address to a different one. However, that was 4 hours ago and my workers are still showing as offline on hermoniers web page. But as i see the mining is going without any problems. Shares are here, Mh/s are in the green...everthing works as it should?

Any suggestions?


[08/07/2021 5:27 PM] Nythain#6769

I've also seen a couple of ads, people selling their used mining rigs, anything from 150 to 700 Mh/s (I presume that's eth hashrates), but I'm not sure that's a better deal than building a new rig...


[08/08/2021 8:04 AM] sh0x#6005
So, if it's hard to get a non-LHR, does it make more sense to go with AMD or it's not on par with even LHRs?

What should we do to pump erg? Everone seems just mining while price lagging behind though it made 2x in a week now.


[08/08/2021 8:57 AM] callie#3352
pump? it take years to make crypto price up. Check history of ethereum price. same price of ergo last 2016. We don't need to pump the coin. Just sit tight and wait couple of years if you want to be rich.


[08/08/2021 9:00 AM] gwapokoohyeah#6196
marketing team is lacking bro, I know whats the game in crypto and reason why prices go up. Erg is lacking some use case and marketing right now.


[08/08/2021 9:05 AM] gwapokoohyeah#6196
Binance smart chain and polygon had made some insane gains due to use cases, cheap fees and fast transaction.

I was only attracted with erg because of profitability but thats it. I know there are dexes coming soon but I dont know if it will gain some traction even auction house  has issues right now.
I also dont hear any news article about the team


[08/08/2021 9:32 AM] callie#3352
Binance smartchain was use by scammer too to pump and dump coin. They will create coin using bsc and then market it for pump and dump. Thats why the price of bnb got skyrocket. If ergo have a usecase like that example creating smart contract with fees and burn, that would be great. They will create large token like nft games, pump and dump coin, legit coin, etc


[08/08/2021 9:37 AM] gwapokoohyeah#6196
any blockchain have scammers like build and dump, pump and dump, rug pulls but that means that the blockchain is popular and great means many investors  to be  scam Usually only people that are uneducated or unfamiliar with dex, no research usually get affected with this specially with shitcoins.

 but overall many dapps are successful bakeryswap, pancakeswap, axie and many moreüòÇ

[08/08/2021 5:13 PM] Nythain#6769
more accurately, difficulty increase is result of increase in nethash and reduction in block time. increased nethash generally translates into more miners but even if not necessarily, it does mean more shares submitted in most pools which means each share worth less. otherwise put, more miners means smaller slices of pizza for everyone

Its specific to this GPU, just wondering if anyone on here has one of those to compare - does not want to push the higher numbers strangely


[08/08/2021 11:03 PM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
Didn't you write that you're getting over 120?


[08/08/2021 11:04 PM] geezar#8187
Yes


[08/08/2021 11:04 PM] geezar#8187
I suggested it was the only one not getting over 120 - this is the problem


[08/08/2021 11:26 PM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
Well if it makes you feel any better I have a Zotac 3060 Ti LHR that crashes at anything over +900 memory and refuses to break 130.5 Mh/s at stable memory overclocks


[08/08/2021 11:31 PM] geezar#8187
I know man... damn LHR @ChaoticKinesis I spent weeks getting a LHR V2 3060 to 119.4 MH/s - ANY change to the clocks in any way and the sucker fell off a cliff to 65 MH/s - initially I ran the thing bone stock at 107 MH/s - no tweaks on clocks - damn LHR


[08/08/2021 11:32 PM] geezar#8187
60ti is a beast too - thats annoying they nerf'd it so hard


[08/08/2021 11:37 PM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
I'm in a similar spot with my EVGA 3080 Ti FTW. I've spent over a month ripping out my hair trying to get the thing stable. I've hit 265 Mh/s at some settings but the core clock keeps spiking and the hashrate drops off a cliff into the mid-100s and stays there for a long time, sometimes indefinitely. Even at extremely conservative settings this is still happening.

I've tried the YouTube trick, to put a small load on the GPU, but that's not completely reliable and is not meant to be minimized. Playing videos locally doesn't seem to work all that much better and drops my max hash rate more.


[08/08/2021 11:40 PM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
The most annoying thing is if I don't constantly watch it, it drops. When I open the mining window to look at it, it goes back up again.


[08/08/2021 11:40 PM] geezar#8187
Nice GPU... but in all honesty it‚Äôs a lot of effort dealing with LHR, the comments about ‚Äòonly effects ETH‚Äô are far from true. I picked up the 3060 LHR couple months ago and been fighting with it ever since.. the ‚Äòwill not install on windows‚Äô and other BS...


[08/08/2021 11:41 PM] geezar#8187
Noticed same. 12 hours AOK small spike and half hash. We need an LHR channel haha


[08/08/2021 11:42 PM] geezar#8187
265MH/s btw... damn that‚Äôs nice


[08/08/2021 11:43 PM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
I actually went like 1-2 weeks seemingly stable with NBMiner. Last night I decided I want to try T-Rex again because it gave me a better hashrate but was less stable. After 30 minutes it was all over the place again and now I can't get the same thing I had before with NBMiner.


[08/08/2021 11:44 PM] geezar#8187
I use Lolminer lower hash than T but more stable (clocks for each need tweaking - same clocks on either miner will not play ball) worth trying it if you have not


[08/08/2021 11:45 PM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
I tried LolMiner but it was just as unstable as T-Rex and worst hash of all


[08/08/2021 11:45 PM] geezar#8187
NB for 10 series for sure to make use of the -mt that said same is available on T too


[08/08/2021 11:46 PM] geezar#8187
When you factor in the time/frustration and behaviour of LHR... wen eBay... Nvidia did a good number on miners with that one


[08/08/2021 11:47 PM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
I'm seriously thinking of just selling this card. I'm using it in my personal desktop so I can't be bothered with always open YouTube videos in the foreground


[08/08/2021 11:51 PM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
Like right now, just opened the window again and average hashrate over the last 5 minutes around 170, never broke 200. Miner in the foreground, immediately goes back up to 250


[08/09/2021 12:17 AM] Sojun#9092
tinkering with a 3070ti this weekend, i dont think it's LHR thats causing the issues of power dropping


[08/09/2021 12:17 AM] Sojun#9092
it seems to be a bios problem


[08/09/2021 12:18 AM] Sojun#9092
id rather just have a 3070

[08/09/2021 12:24 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
I had the same thing with my 3080 Ti until I tried not locking the core/voltage and the power fluctuations stopped. As long as I do it with offsets only, power does not fluctuate at all. However, core clock (and in turn hashrate) still does fluctuate for me


[08/09/2021 12:24 AM] Sojun#9092
yeah it does seem like something is different with the cards in terms of how that works. its likely a bug in the drivers


[08/09/2021 12:25 AM] Sojun#9092
some people are confusing it with LHR on ERGO but no, that isnt the case


[08/09/2021 12:27 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
I agree, this is not at all related to the LHR issues on the new cards, which have reduced hashrates but are perfectly stable. I believe this affects the 3070 Ti and 3080 Ti models


[08/09/2021 12:27 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
just not as many people posting about it with 3070 Tis for me to be sure but I've seen others with 3080 Ti


[08/09/2021 12:28 AM] Sojun#9092
yeah its the same thing. on some clock speeds its fine too, even fixed


[08/09/2021 12:28 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
Are you on Windows?


[08/09/2021 12:28 AM] Sojun#9092
so my guess is, if you dont guess 'allowed' values for the core, it goes into a lower power state


[08/09/2021 12:29 AM] Sojun#9092
im on hive right now but i started testing in windows


[08/09/2021 12:29 AM] Sojun#9092
check mem temps and such üòÑ


[08/09/2021 12:29 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
I'm not sure about that because the clock does 15 MHz intervals and I've tried just about everything possible in 15 MHz intervals


[08/09/2021 12:30 AM] Sojun#9092
3070ti is much like a 3080 in terms of having mem temp sensors


[08/09/2021 12:30 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
also locking anything in the curve editor/miner completely breaks power stability. I've confirmed this at just about every imaginable voltage/clock combination


[08/09/2021 12:30 AM] Sojun#9092
well just because it clocks 15 mh offsets doesnt mean its valid for the driver

thats about the most efficient i can do


[08/09/2021 12:31 AM] Sojun#9092
im kinda confused, i feel like a 3070ti should be able to crank out near 200 and compete with a 3080


[08/09/2021 12:31 AM] Sojun#9092
but thats what i get üòê


[08/09/2021 12:32 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
At this point I don't give a damn about efficiency even. I just want to find something that will get me stable at or around 1500-1600 MHz because that seems to be the sweet spot, though if I need to go lower for stability I'll take it


[08/09/2021 12:33 AM] Sojun#9092
well i think the dag generation has a lot to do with the variable in power/hash rates

[08/09/2021 12:33 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
The problem is it constantly shoots up to around 1700-1800 MHz and that completely kills the hashrate


[08/09/2021 12:33 AM] Sojun#9092
notice i get a low hash value, but then dag is done in 1927 ms and it hops back up to 16x

im using a fixed core here


[08/09/2021 12:34 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
If I fix core, I constantly drop from my current 207W down to 160W


[08/09/2021 12:34 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
same with fixed voltage


[08/09/2021 12:35 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
and then it can stay there


[08/09/2021 12:35 AM] Sojun#9092
ah


[08/09/2021 12:36 AM] Sojun#9092
well


[08/09/2021 12:36 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
And this is definitely not due to OC stability, I've tried with stock memory and very conservative OC


[08/09/2021 12:36 AM] Sojun#9092
whats your mem oc at?


[08/09/2021 12:36 AM] Sojun#9092
try core like 1750 and mem like...in windows 300, linux 600


[08/09/2021 12:37 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
It's not the best, I was doing +1000 but I'm down to +900 until I figure out the crashes I've been getting the last 2 days

[08/09/2021 12:37 AM] Sojun#9092
im at only +300 in windows here. ergo doesnt require lots of mem oc


[08/09/2021 12:37 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
I get a huge drop off in the hashrate if I drop memory like that


[08/09/2021 12:37 AM] Sojun#9092
i think the power controller is giving memory first dibs on power


[08/09/2021 12:38 AM] Sojun#9092
and so, when yours does the 207 to 160w i suspect its just decided the memory needs it first.


[08/09/2021 12:44 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
I'm going to try again for a bit and report back but I feel like I've experienced this even with memo OCs around there


[08/09/2021 12:45 AM] Sojun#9092
got my card tamed but i think id rather just have a 3070


[08/09/2021 12:48 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
I dropped mem to +300, core/voltage unlocked jumps from ~1600/875 to 1800 core


[08/09/2021 12:48 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
I lock core/voltage and it drops to 160W


[08/09/2021 12:50 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
I've considered your mem controller power theory before but I refuse to believe that such a low mem OC would trigger that


[08/09/2021 12:50 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
Also hashrate is now terrible at 240 Mh/s


[08/09/2021 12:51 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
and that's 100% due to the memory clock


[08/09/2021 12:51 AM] Sojun#9092
i think i figured it out


[08/09/2021 12:51 AM] Sojun#9092
just remove your power limit


[08/09/2021 12:51 AM] Sojun#9092
or, give a nice buffer for the power limit


[08/09/2021 12:52 AM] Sojun#9092
when the dag builds, the power pulled from the GPU core goes up a lot


[08/09/2021 12:52 AM] Sojun#9092
if its too much, as in the core lacks power to do the work, it just dumps into a lower power state


[08/09/2021 12:54 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
I've tried that too and it doesn't fix it. Normally my power is at 52% unlocked. I just raised it to 70%, and even 100%, and it's still dropping to 160W


[08/09/2021 1:06 AM] ChaoticKinesis#0163
Also, going back to the small GPU load trick, if I play a YouTube video in the foreground the fluctuations will stop for a while


[08/09/2021 1:15 AM] BuzzLiteBeer#8676

Can someone pinpoin there is a lot of rejected shares on my hiveos, 1 day eqaual of 12 invalid share


[08/09/2021 1:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Random question, will the 3060s with in built lhr still yield less hash for ergo than non lhr 3060s?


[08/09/2021 1:19 PM] CryptoMinerOS#1745
What is the ratio of your valid to invalid shares? It is normal to get invalid shares from time to time as long as it is not too much like less than 1%

You should also check what is the exact message on the invalid shares.

Stale job/Invalid job - This is acceptable as there will be a time that the pool sends a new job while you are submitting a share. 
Duplicate share/Invalid share -  Usually invalid shares is caused by too much overclock. You should make this type of invalid shares at a minimum or none at all.


[08/09/2021 1:30 PM] callie#3352
I'm mining 2 days now and I have ratio of 99.74%. Also I don't usually get invalid share on hiveos when mining ethereum not sure why, the overclock is the same for my eth settings to ergo settings.


[08/09/2021 2:57 PM] Nythain#6769

loathe to share a NH link but its a good breakdown. Linux does not have this hassle, lots of distro's available - consider looking at a mining OS (even if a gaming PC can boot from USB for mining and remove for gaming/productivity) appreciate will not work for all but a good way to remove windows out the equation..

It can be a hassle if your running low - in the past I've added a 2nd SSD or even a USB drive, mounted and used the space on there in the interim - you can adjust the location of the VM to get it to play ball - again, you don't have this hassle with Linux distro's


[08/09/2021 5:05 PM] geezar#8187
Becomes a bigger hassle if your boot drive is 120GB - and running a few GPUs + storage/windows OS ever increasingly bloatware... easy option is slap another dedicated SSD or something in the rig, then use that for the VM - bit of a hack OR remove redundant files to free up the space

do i set the size in mb to 8192? cuz 8 gb 3070 times 1024


[08/09/2021 5:07 PM] geezar#8187
yep you can adjust the location to D - assuming you have not maxed out the D drive right?

nope

Is there a way of checking if the GPU is non-LHR? Does GPU-Z provide this information? I've found an unused RTX 3070 Master 8G DDR6 (1050 eur) and an unused GAINWARD GeForce RTX 3070 Phoenix (890 eur) and both resellers claim they are non-LHR. Is there a way for me to make sure prior to buying? Thanks for your answers.

Yep, junction temps on Vegas will do that if pushed too hard or insufficient cooling the allure of 200+ MH/s gets old quick with heat and the excessive power usage - amazing hash for those old GPU's tho üëç throttle them back for a while and confirm what the cause is - ASIC for me is 45 and mem temp 55 nice and cool 2/3 max hash is a nice balance of hash/management for 24/7 mining IMO

hey just started mining for the first time in my life, and i chose ergo.  im using hiveos. I have a rtx 3070ti thats running great, getting 175mh out of it.  Im having a problem with my 2 vega 56s.  It seems i can only get 62mh out of each of them.  Ive seen people putting up much bigger numbers with them.  Every time i try new settings they seem to crash no matter what.  Is anyone in here experienced with the vega 56s that is willing to lend a helping hand it would be much appreciated

Just wanted to follow up on this thing because I know others have also struggled to stabilize their 3070/3080 Ti hashrates, and it seems this was spot on. Finally tried locking core at 1590, voltage at 775, and it is finally stable. No YouTube video bs, no babying it, just stable. I'm sure there are other stable settings but even the slightest change makes it jump around. I've confirmed that this persists over multiple reboots and regardless of whether other programs are running or not.

Assumed you proved it worked yesterday when you said thanks, OK so as suggested drop clocks to STOCK and dial in from there + any intensity/additional params set in your T-Rex config (basically run/test bone stock) also try an alternative miner like NB/Lolminer etc just in case


[08/10/2021 12:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
I have, they give less hash


[08/10/2021 12:57 PM] geezar#8187
The point of the test was to prove the GPU was not at fault cutting out T-Rex out of the equation


[08/10/2021 12:58 PM] geezar#8187
If another miner works.. then it is that installation/version or params being used

Providing both lock clock and cclock shouldn't happen. Also with lock clock you don't need PL.

[08/10/2021 10:13 PM] geezar#8187
Depends how much power you want to use but 156MH/s @  140w give or take - pushing it harder will see 171 MH/s but more power


[08/10/2021 10:16 PM] apexpool#3878
Thanks. I just bought today a NEW Radeon RX Vega 56 from ebay, it should do more with less power (and it's cheaper), can't wait to test it... in a few days.

[08/10/2021 10:21 PM] geezar#8187
Nice - only got mine today and still dialling in - locked core to 1500 and the power down to 135-140 - I'll check that out see if I can get it to hash more, EVGA is the king however


[08/10/2021 10:22 PM] paperkut#9249

1500 locked core no mem OC and dropping to 140 - need to mess around some more - T-Rex may give me a boost


[08/10/2021 10:27 PM] apexpool#3878
is this LHR or non-LHR?

All 3070 ti are LHR


[08/10/2021 10:29 PM] apexpool#3878
I didn't know... 174 seems impressive for a LHR


[08/10/2021 10:30 PM] apexpool#3878
and with that low power


[08/10/2021 10:31 PM] paperkut#9249
Definitely have to mess around to get that more than non LHR which seems to dial in quicker. NBMiner was easier to dial in than Trex but you can't use core or mem settings in NB. You have to use Afterburner which I don't like as much.


[08/10/2021 10:31 PM] geezar#8187
thats nice


[08/10/2021 10:32 PM] geezar#8187
day one of testing but for sure want to stay 135-140w


[08/10/2021 10:34 PM] paperkut#9249
Agreed that seems to be the power needed but could be more depending on card I presume


[08/10/2021 10:36 PM] geezar#8187
Best I've seen so far - maybe the EVGA special sauce


[08/10/2021 10:38 PM] paperkut#9249

3070 ti eagle mining is it useable? the only model that I can get for 1K USD

I am worry about cooling performance


[08/11/2021 12:15 AM] paperkut#9249
Ergo runs cool so should be fine. From what I‚Äôve read the eagle is basically the same as the founders card. 1K is high for eagle though.

TRM has a decent guide for tuning: https://github.com/todxx/teamredminer/blob/master/doc/AUTOLYKOS_TUNING.txt


[08/11/2021 9:15 AM] geezar#8187
He's still offering his unique blend of relentless support to people over on TRM - staggering how someone can mix extreme toxicity with an apparent willingness to help others, there are many others on there with a less aggressive approach many a member of the commutiy for many years now..


[08/11/2021 9:18 AM] geezar#8187
Agree @andee that is a good guide and 'place to start' not everyone is looking to max the GPUs and in turn face the high power consunption/heat generation the 'full send' approach entails. Impressive to see people pushing the envelope none the less - a bit of DYOR and testing reaps a lot of rewards not using 'mandated' settings..


[08/11/2021 10:17 AM] andee#4722
it will get people to a performance they can be happy with, it takes a lot of effort to understand all the parameters to tweak amd cards for maximum performance. amd rocks when finished tuning and they can hash away, but are usually way harder to push than nvidia


[08/11/2021 11:00 AM] geezar#8187
Agree - those settings are a 'safe baseline' never intended to be the most efficient nor the highest hashing - personally I spend weeks on GPU's and find my own best clocks


[08/11/2021 2:29 PM] Terremot#4855
I've got my cards tuned to a level I like, with less than 20 rejects after mining for 3 days after the reconfig of 4x3070


[08/11/2021 2:31 PM] Terremot#4855
I would personally suggest that approach as it doesn't kill the vram


[08/11/2021 3:31 PM] geezar#8187
@Terremot what do you run the 3070's at - asume non LHR?


[08/11/2021 3:34 PM] Terremot#4855
yeah, non-lhr


[08/11/2021 3:34 PM] Terremot#4855
one of my cards I've set to about 157mhs just because of fan noise


[08/11/2021 3:34 PM] Terremot#4855
and it was a good decision tbh


[08/11/2021 3:35 PM] Terremot#4855
as I get fewer rejects from all cards, by tuning them individually


[08/11/2021 3:37 PM] Terremot#4855
after power, I get $1.50 a day more mining ergo


[08/11/2021 3:37 PM] Terremot#4855

IM  mining ergo using herominers with just a 2 GPU setup and for whatever reason my computer will shut itself down after a few hours of mining if its not in use. I'm using windows 10 and have adjusted the sleep/power option and nothing seems to stop it from shutting down. I was using nicehash before switching over and never had any problems with my pc powering down. Any help would be great I dont want to use nicehash anymore lol ERGO for the win!

[08/12/2021 6:14 AM] andee#4722
you have to subtract time spent creating dataset and devfee from your miner reported hashrate


[08/12/2021 6:17 AM] Camellia#0001
I see


[08/12/2021 6:18 AM] andee#4722
some miners report more accurate than others


[08/12/2021 6:18 AM] Camellia#0001
I mean i knew the dev fee but I hadn't really considered DAG generation


[08/12/2021 6:18 AM] Camellia#0001
does ergo regenerate the dag every block?


[08/12/2021 6:19 AM] andee#4722
yes, the miner reports how many seconds it takes on each block


[08/12/2021 6:19 AM] andee#4722
higher core reduces the time it takes


[08/12/2021 6:19 AM] Camellia#0001
That seems inefficient


[08/12/2021 6:23 AM] andee#4722
probably part of the trick to fight of ASIC's


[08/12/2021 6:23 AM] Camellia#0001
are asics bad at generating dag?


[08/12/2021 6:26 AM] andee#4722
it just has to be made more like a gpu, which makes it less financially viable


[08/12/2021 6:27 AM] Camellia#0001
oooh


[08/12/2021 6:31 AM] Camellia#0001
so less of the design & budget is put directly into hashing & more into specifically to make sure the computer it's bundled with can generate the dag, therefore making it pretty useless to create a asic for it


[08/12/2021 6:54 AM] andee#4722
I am not knowledgeable about the subject, but a btc miner is pretty trivial compared to an eth miner or a potential ergo miner

hey guys,
does anyone have recommandations for cheap Mainboard/CPU combination for 4 - 5 cards? usally went with b450 am4 boards and a cheap ryzen/athlon which is compatible. with ram i usally paid around 120 euros


[08/12/2021 9:26 AM] geezar#8187
Cheapest setup I ran was a single PCI slot i5 2500 CPU and USB adapter PCI - I ran 4 GPU's on there (1st rig in 2017) - no need to invest heavy IMO on a rig unless you want to pay the 'mining' tax overhead


[08/12/2021 9:27 AM] geezar#8187

[08/12/2021 9:28 AM] geezar#8187
be aware... some of them simply did not work or failed to work on all slots but yet to see a lower cost way to get a rig up - any mobo can work even a single PCI slot - especially when using a linux bootable OS headless - the adapters DOA just get sent back (easier if bought via Amazon, not so much alibaba..)


[08/12/2021 11:47 AM] Indris#1721
Hi, i am new to mining Ergo and was thinking. Do i need to have the wallet node always up and running?


[08/12/2021 12:28 PM] Nythain#6769
If you are solo mining on it yes. If youre just using it as a wallet no. But longer its down longer it will take to sync when you start it back up

Key is you can only work within a budget - dedicated mining* gear is fine but you can still get in with a low-baller setup üëç


[08/12/2021 2:04 PM] geezar#8187
Alternative ofc to cut-out that adapter is pickup a board with at least 4 PCI lanes (x8/x16 if you intend to use 3060's for ETH etc but thats a different story - for ERG pickup a used board with as many pci lanes as possible IMO


[08/12/2021 2:05 PM] WINNI#3324
yeah my goal is only to run 4 - 5 vega 56/64 on each rig

[08/12/2021 2:07 PM] geezar#8187
nice plan - no point spending way OTT unless you need to use it as a non dedicated rig/cpu mining - I still use dual core celerons.. all in at the wall mobo power 42w - add in the atw per GPU and runs efficient, running a more powerful CPU even not under load is going to add watts so...

[08/12/2021 9:07 PM] geezar#8187
Only hassle (6 different ones at the time) was sometimes I only got 3/4 of the risers to play ball - sometimes they would fall off the rig for no apparent reason. If secured down will be ok but a small x1 connector and hanging off 4 USB cables was always going to be sketchy - if using them try to secure (even zip ties)


[08/12/2021 9:08 PM] geezar#8187
6600XT is arguably new and affordable.. just not sure entry around $450-$500 32 MH/s ETH and I saw around 60 MH/s on ERG - that said a $150-$200 Polaris will run 60-70 MH/s so....


[08/12/2021 9:09 PM] geezar#8187
Cheaper still 3GB 1060 48-57 MH/s 60w-75w so good cheaper options to get a rig going + using the USB riser approach IMO


[08/12/2021 9:10 PM] geezar#8187

Anyone has got oc for rtx3060 ti v1


[08/12/2021 10:17 PM] miner29#2975
running -350 core / 1250 on locked core and +2400 on mem pl=130w gets me 62-63mhs on eth


[08/12/2021 10:18 PM] unknowuser#8752
I have got lhr v1


[08/12/2021 10:19 PM] miner29#2975
ah sorry saw v1 thought you meant pre lhr...havent bought one since stupid price and stupid lhr...did get a $399 v1 3060 lhr ... get 38mhs from it


[08/13/2021 1:37 AM] stevo#4238
I'll tell ya guys what, the v1 nerfed 3060 is a total gem at mining

[08/13/2021 1:38 AM] stevo#4238
it hasn't been easy getting these cards at retail, and I very much consider myself lucky to have 4, I manage to grab about 1 a month


[08/13/2021 2:22 AM] r3drud#6083
I‚Äôm struggling with a v1 in HiveOS. I can only get 103 out of it, probably need to look at the driver version


[08/13/2021 2:51 AM] stevo#4238
absolutely, I will give hiveOS another go sometime, regardless you want to use those beta drivers-- what I found was that they nerfed ERG mining on v1 cards with the new drivers-- you can simply roll back. So give it a go with the 470.05 drivers


[08/13/2021 2:52 AM] stevo#4238
at least that's what I am using on windows


[08/13/2021 4:13 AM] r3drud#6083
Yeah on windows I‚Äôm getting almost the exact same hash rates as you.

use driver 460.39 for 3060v1 in hiveos. core 1540 memory 2500 power 130 fan 85%, t-rex, nbminer, lolminer. oc settings are estimated. check with your cards. but driver 460.39 is essentially to reach 12x mh/s

{Reactions}
üëç 

[08/13/2021 8:19 AM] geezar#8187
You can run 105-110w to get up to 125 but thats a great result for the power üëç


[08/13/2021 8:19 AM] stevo#4238
Oooo what settings, willing to give it a go!


[08/13/2021 8:22 AM] geezar#8187
@stevo use Dev driver and -200/2600/110 - depending on the GPU you can push to 2700 mem. play with the offset - some like -500 some -150


[08/13/2021 8:22 AM] geezar#8187
takes a lot of dialing in pushing past 122 but can be done


[08/13/2021 8:23 AM] stevo#4238
Now as I understand, 2700- on hive right? Not windows


[08/13/2021 8:23 AM] geezar#8187
or accept 100w and 122-123


[08/13/2021 8:24 AM] geezar#8187
windows works with dev driver, on linux 460.39 as @ThomasToka|Serverman Webhosting suggests yep

the mem needs good cooling... watch out anything over 70...


[08/13/2021 8:25 AM] geezar#8187
but if you can keep them cool at 2600 or higher.. will push past as high as 127.4 (silly high mem and not recomended)


[08/13/2021 8:25 AM] stevo#4238
Thanks for the tip- the 3060 really is a gem in this space I feel. Solid card for the money.


[08/13/2021 8:25 AM] geezar#8187
happy place for efficiency around 100w - 122MH/s


[08/13/2021 8:25 AM] stevo#4238
Yet so hard to obtain retail haha


[08/13/2021 8:25 AM] geezar#8187
it gets a lot of hate but the V1's are good


[08/13/2021 8:26 AM] stevo#4238
I think so too- I want more but I think I‚Äôm sort of at the end of the road of seeing these unless I can score another evga b stock.


[08/13/2021 8:26 AM] stevo#4238
I‚Äôm going to try a Vega 56 this weekend I am picking up for $500 locally


[08/13/2021 8:26 AM] geezar#8187
Only option is used - I scored an LHR - max and I mean MAX was 119.4 MH/s


[08/13/2021 8:26 AM] geezar#8187
after weeks (really) of testing incremental settings.. key with these is test and keep testing


[08/13/2021 8:26 AM] geezar#8187
no off the shelf magic settings work for all


[08/13/2021 8:27 AM] stevo#4238
Man, I grabbed a 3060ti LHR the other day, went straight to eBay the next day. What a joke of a card. So hard to tune.


[08/13/2021 8:27 AM] geezar#8187
ironically an LHR V2 will sit 88w at stock clocks at 115w doing 107 MH/s all day long so... perhaps thats the best place for them lol


[08/13/2021 8:27 AM] stevo#4238
That‚Äôs exactly what I found too, and it‚Äôs like forum threads are super inconclusive


[08/13/2021 8:27 AM] geezar#8187
Sold my LHR V2 - just too sketchy and got bored but had to prove I could get good hash


[08/13/2021 8:28 AM] stevo#4238
Yep you and I both, they are super unfriendly to work with


[08/13/2021 8:28 AM] geezar#8187
for me I do a quick search then do a lot of my own testing - only share if I can confirm and for good efficiency - one card will respond 100% different to others so always need to dial them in - total hassle LHR..


[08/13/2021 8:28 AM] geezar#8187
I love the 'it only affects ETH' comment


[08/13/2021 8:29 AM] stevo#4238
Total hassle for sure


[08/13/2021 8:29 AM] stevo#4238
Lololol right??


[08/13/2021 8:29 AM] geezar#8187
having tried a few now can confirm not the case


[08/13/2021 8:29 AM] geezar#8187
loool


[08/13/2021 8:29 AM] stevo#4238
So many of those, yeah right


[08/13/2021 8:29 AM] stevo#4238
Have you used Vega‚Äôs yet? I should be able to mix with my 3060‚Äôs on windows right?


[08/13/2021 8:29 AM] geezar#8187
60ti is a shocker on this algo tho... 135 MH/s - as you can see the 60 V1 can be cranked and get pretty close


[08/13/2021 8:29 AM] geezar#8187
Vegas are good but people only see the reported power...


[08/13/2021 8:30 AM] geezar#8187
people pushing '200 MH/s' get the magic number but the power at the wall can creep well over 200w... so...


[08/13/2021 8:30 AM] stevo#4238
Wait, original 3060ti will only do 135mh?


[08/13/2021 8:30 AM] geezar#8187
reported + power at wall... unlike Gigabytes that report the actual power consumption


[08/13/2021 8:30 AM] geezar#8187
the others usually do not


[08/13/2021 8:31 AM] geezar#8187
nvidia I've found report it acurately, again I measure using a wall meter no gpu then add them


[08/13/2021 8:31 AM] stevo#4238
Yeah I‚Äôll have to see what I can make it do.


[08/13/2021 8:31 AM] ThomasToka|Serverman Webhosting#5758
my best 3060v1 runs with 122,8mh/s at 93w. gigabyte oc.


[08/13/2021 8:31 AM] geezar#8187
@ThomasToka|Serverman Webhosting nice


[08/13/2021 8:31 AM] geezar#8187
would take that over the 'magic' high numbers as more efficient üëç


[08/13/2021 8:32 AM] geezar#8187
otherwise paying the 17w tax for 2-3 MH/s is nuts...

[08/13/2021 8:32 AM] geezar#8187
Original 165-170


[08/13/2021 8:32 AM] geezar#8187
LHR 135


[08/13/2021 8:32 AM] stevo#4238
Ohh okay just making sure


[08/13/2021 8:32 AM] stevo#4238
That‚Äôs what I thought


[08/13/2021 8:33 AM] geezar#8187
if you actually play out those numbers... damn impressive and more efficient that the 80 or 90 technically on this algo


[08/13/2021 8:33 AM] stevo#4238
Yeah the 3060 ti is an efficiency monster


[08/13/2021 8:33 AM] stevo#4238
Saw that too


[08/13/2021 8:33 AM] geezar#8187
alas... used market place to go for V1's

[08/13/2021 8:35 AM] stevo#4238
Secondary market or bot serverman?


[08/13/2021 8:35 AM] geezar#8187
locking core to 1000-1090 seems to vary - mem stock or even 2400... so many tweaks yield so little benefit


[08/13/2021 8:36 AM] stevo#4238
Haha


[08/13/2021 8:36 AM] stevo#4238
Im tempted to try the Amazon bot to nab a couple more cards. I don‚Äôt know what else to do haha.


[08/13/2021 8:36 AM] geezar#8187
,am @paperkut how did you manage 175 MH/s at 139w - running out of ideas lol


[08/13/2021 8:36 AM] ThomasToka|Serverman Webhosting#5758

3060v1 (650 euro), 3060v2 (550 euro), 3060tiLHR (650 euro), 3070tiLHR (850 euro)


[08/13/2021 8:39 AM] ThomasToka|Serverman Webhosting#5758
but depends on brand and you have to look dayly to get those prices.


[08/13/2021 9:04 AM] geezar#8187
nice prices @ThomasToka|Serverman Webhosting the supplier even knows which are V1/V2 - some GPU's there is no way of telling other than they fail with the Dev driver/460.39

[08/13/2021 11:49 AM] apexpool#3878
I bought from ebay a ASUS AMD Radeon Strix RX Vega 56 GPU 8GB OC Edition (90YV0B50-M0NA00), which is new (unused). I also bought a new PSU 850W Gold, because my PC had a 500W PSU. I bought it for mining Ergo.
I have issues with it... The PC starts (Linux, Windows, it doesn't matter) and after some time the monitor just stops (no signal), and after a few seconds the computer freezes. after reset, the on-board card (am have an AMD with integrated graphics CPU) takes over, and in Bios I see the PCI Express slot Empty, although the RX Vega is there. There comes no signal from the RX Vega GPU...
After some time and a few resets, it starts working again, and after a few minutes of working it crashes again. I've put it back in the box 4 or 5 times until now, then after a while I tried it again, the same happens. I also flashed the latest Bios for my Mainboard, a MSI A320M-A PRO MAX. No change. 
The PC is working perfectly with a GTX 1650 on the same slots (it's been running for months perfectly). 
Any idea what might be the problem?


[08/13/2021 11:51 AM] Herk#6019
are you sure it was a new, unused vega 56?


[08/13/2021 11:52 AM] apexpool#3878
the seller said so, the package was opened (he wrote that just to take pictures), but the plastic foil on the back was still there, and it looks new, no dust at all. I am not sure, of course.


[08/13/2021 11:53 AM] paperkut#9249
I thought core and power affected heat. Mem is only stability


[08/13/2021 11:54 AM] andee#4722
if I was selling a brand new gpu I would have used pictures of the box and shown the unbroken seal. I find it strange to open a box when there are plenty of stock photos


[08/13/2021 11:54 AM] Herk#6019
sounds like it is PSU related but 850W should be able to provide enough power to that card, I would contact the seller since it was opened though


[08/13/2021 11:54 AM] Herk#6019
99.837% used for mining

[08/13/2021 11:56 AM] Most.Wanted#4457
Reduce the components 

Use only the 850w if you have enough cables and whatever 

Then plug the card into the PCI x16 slot


[08/13/2021 11:56 AM] apexpool#3878
I find it strange, too.


[08/13/2021 11:57 AM] andee#4722
have you tried changing power cables?


[08/13/2021 11:57 AM] apexpool#3878
I don't have many other components (just a few HDDs).


[08/13/2021 11:57 AM] Herk#6019
well he mentions he bought a new 850W psu


[08/13/2021 11:57 AM] andee#4722
I just assume that the 1650 does not use 2 8 pins so you haven't tested them there


[08/13/2021 11:57 AM] Herk#6019
I assume the cables are new


[08/13/2021 11:57 AM] apexpool#3878
the MB has only one x16 and one x1 PCI Express


[08/13/2021 11:57 AM] apexpool#3878
yes, PSU and Cables are new

[08/13/2021 11:58 AM] Most.Wanted#4457
Just reduce to the minimum you need 

Mainboards
850w PSU

Plug the card into the pcix16

Connect your video cable and boot the PC


[08/13/2021 11:58 AM] apexpool#3878
no, no extra power cables for 1650.


[08/13/2021 11:58 AM] Herk#6019
I just doubt you'll be able to find a brand new vega 56


[08/13/2021 11:58 AM] Herk#6019
which is why I said contact the seller and be straight, ask him if he used it for mining since it's not working on your end


[08/13/2021 11:59 AM] Most.Wanted#4457
I bought one in March but was pretty lucky üòÖ

It's been from a local shop that didn't get it sold


[08/13/2021 11:59 AM] geezar#8187
lots of people selling abused vegas now, some OK some not so much.. some listed as parts.. some not... with the inflated prices and being scarce not impossible for a hacked repaired or abused one to cause issues perhaps


[08/13/2021 11:59 AM] Herk#6019
that I can understand, but vega 56 beasts for mining


[08/13/2021 11:59 AM] geezar#8187

doubt that will happen even with a faulty vega 56 üòÑ


[08/13/2021 12:04 PM] andee#4722
but do not wait to open a case, do it as fast as possible after receiving and confirming that there is a problem. then document it and complain


[08/13/2021 12:04 PM] geezar#8187
no


[08/13/2021 12:04 PM] geezar#8187
open a case you may be lucky


[08/13/2021 12:04 PM] geezar#8187
provide evidence/pics and a description of why you want your money back - for sure works

just give the seller a chance to explain first


[08/13/2021 12:06 PM] Herk#6019
he might be honest since now it's all in your hands

doesn't look tampered with but you never know until you open it


[08/13/2021 12:07 PM] Herk#6019
could be a $10 fix

[08/13/2021 12:07 PM] Herk#6019
I wouldn't risk it unless it was super cheap though


[08/13/2021 12:08 PM] apexpool#3878
it was not cheap, 550 Euro.


[08/13/2021 12:08 PM] apexpool#3878
used ones are sold for almost 500


[08/13/2021 12:08 PM] geezar#8187
pretty clean TBH


[08/13/2021 12:08 PM] geezar#8187
56 or 64 @apexpool ?


[08/13/2021 12:09 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, it looks very clean.


[08/13/2021 12:09 PM] apexpool#3878
56


[08/13/2021 12:09 PM] geezar#8187
550 Euro is about average, seen them a lot higher recently

[08/13/2021 12:09 PM] geezar#8187
Do you have another rig to test it on?


[08/13/2021 12:10 PM] Herk#6019
doubt these come with 3 months warranty üôÇ


[08/13/2021 12:10 PM] Herk#6019
so definitely not new


[08/13/2021 12:10 PM] geezar#8187
if its Samsung arguably they could have pushed a 64 BIOS but these days people generally stick with 56 BIOS - or is it Hynix? just wondering if anyone has messed with flashed - again you can try both BIOS switches to confirm


[08/13/2021 12:10 PM] apexpool#3878
no, unfortunately not, I don't have another PC


[08/13/2021 12:10 PM] apexpool#3878
Hynix


[08/13/2021 12:11 PM] geezar#8187
Strix bios switch is here unless you did not know

worth booting up with either and establish whats what


[08/13/2021 12:11 PM] Herk#6019
I wouldn't


[08/13/2021 12:11 PM] Herk#6019
it's best to not touch these things if you plan on returning


[08/13/2021 12:11 PM] Herk#6019
gives the seller less motives to complain


[08/13/2021 12:11 PM] Herk#6019
and risk your $


[08/13/2021 12:11 PM] geezar#8187
All I'm suggesting is to test in either location


[08/13/2021 12:12 PM] geezar#8187
not flash anything - that said, sure just send it back I guess


[08/13/2021 12:12 PM] apexpool#3878
what can I do with that switch?


[08/13/2021 12:12 PM] geezar#8187
the GPU comes with 2 BIOS settings - if someone has messed with it could be the issue, not really the case on Hynix TBF


[08/13/2021 12:12 PM] Herk#6019
understood, just saying, if he's planning on keep it might even be worth sending it for a check/repair ofc, up to him to decide if it's worth the $ and hassle


[08/13/2021 12:13 PM] geezar#8187
Yep totally with you @Herk would only take a scratch/accident when installing/messing with it for sure


[08/13/2021 12:13 PM] geezar#8187
Personally I would test it - but get your $$$ back


[08/13/2021 12:15 PM] Herk#6019
it's strange with this since it's still under warranty for a few months

[08/13/2021 12:15 PM] Herk#6019
I think they have transferable warranty even, not sure if you could RMA it even üòÑ


[08/13/2021 12:16 PM] geezar#8187
Was wondering the same actually RMA üôÇ


[08/13/2021 12:16 PM] apexpool#3878
I guess the sell price was a lot lower a few years ago


[08/13/2021 12:16 PM] geezar#8187
@apexpool just to confirm - it is seen in windows + linux, you can mine on both but it stops after a while? could be your OC settings?


[08/13/2021 12:16 PM] apexpool#3878
and probably they don't have others now


[08/13/2021 12:17 PM] apexpool#3878
not mining, just staying and doing nothing.


[08/13/2021 12:17 PM] geezar#8187
can you plug the monitor direct to the mobo or you going to use for gaming too and need to plug it in?


[08/13/2021 12:19 PM] apexpool#3878
I can try to put the monitor directly to the mobo, but it did not work with the GTX, I only had signal from GTX while it was mounted.


[08/13/2021 12:19 PM] apexpool#3878
I would use it for gaming, too (and my son, too üôÇ )


[08/13/2021 12:19 PM] geezar#8187
BIOS mobo need to reconfigure usually - it will detect the GPU and try to use that rather than on-board


[08/13/2021 12:19 PM] geezar#8187
hmmmm thing is


[08/13/2021 12:20 PM] geezar#8187
you should NOT have to deal with this hassle.... maybe call it once tested a little and get cash back - Vegas dont last long even for 550 Euro so the seller should know this too


[08/13/2021 12:21 PM] geezar#8187
FPS on newer 30 series GPUs would be significantly better, even a 3060 over the vega but for this algo agree Vega is made out of pure gold üôÇ


[08/13/2021 12:22 PM] apexpool#3878
I know, I wanted it for mining, because it seems very good for that. Better than anything else for the same price or eve much higher


[08/13/2021 12:23 PM] apexpool#3878
I was watching a second one, identical, used, but I'll pass.


[08/13/2021 12:23 PM] apexpool#3878
I'll write the seller, to see what he says. Thanks everyone for support!


[08/13/2021 12:23 PM] Herk#6019
good luck, maybe he refunds 50%


[08/13/2021 12:23 PM] Herk#6019
you never know


[08/13/2021 12:24 PM] apexpool#3878
you mean like 50% refund and keep the card?


[08/13/2021 12:24 PM] Herk#6019
yea


[08/13/2021 12:24 PM] Herk#6019
again only if you're willing to deal with it yourself


[08/13/2021 12:24 PM] Herk#6019
and get it RMA'd or repaired somewhere


[08/13/2021 12:25 PM] apexpool#3878
yea, I'll have to see first what he says.


[08/13/2021 12:25 PM] Herk#6019

I was wondering, too, because they are actually  supermarket

Is there a site which shows which bios i should download for max hashrate?

E.g. Gigabyte 64 with samsung and 56 gigabyte bios is performing worse then a gigabyte 56 hynix


[08/13/2021 2:39 PM] geezar#8187
Generally the BIOS is not the limiting factor more the OC and straps TBH @WINNI


[08/13/2021 2:40 PM] geezar#8187
As a general rule I choose the '56' version of the same GPU if going 64 > 56

[08/13/2021 2:41 PM] andee#4722
I think most of the advantages by using 56 bios is being able to set lower voltages


[08/13/2021 2:41 PM] andee#4722
but I don't own any, so I may be wrong


[08/13/2021 2:41 PM] geezar#8187
950 - 900 yep


[08/13/2021 3:45 PM] miner29#2975

see if that works?

have you tried running the rig without it?


[08/13/2021 11:18 PM] Lincoln#2624

I do like amd, but I have to say that nvidia has been a lot easier to clock for different algos


[08/13/2021 11:27 PM] Lincoln#2624
im never going to buy another AMD card again


[08/13/2021 11:29 PM] andee#4722
I will üòÑ but if you are building another 12gpu rig I would start with half of the gpu's first and get them stable before adding the rest


[08/13/2021 11:30 PM] Lincoln#2624
It‚Äôs just TRM


[08/13/2021 11:30 PM] Lincoln#2624
My nvidias have 0 problem


[08/13/2021 11:30 PM] andee#4722
have you tried a different miner?


[08/13/2021 11:31 PM] Lincoln#2624
Yeah they work fine on nanominer but get shit hash


[08/13/2021 11:31 PM] andee#4722
have you tried lolminer?


[08/13/2021 11:32 PM] Lincoln#2624
Same thing shit hash


[08/13/2021 11:32 PM] andee#4722
I went from 625 to 615 on lol on my amd rig, but poolside is correct. seems like you get a bigger loss though


[08/13/2021 11:33 PM] andee#4722
with srbminer its possible to adjust intensity


[08/13/2021 11:40 PM] andee#4722
I would try 1400 core @ 925vdd with stock memory voltage before selling though


[08/13/2021 11:43 PM] Lincoln#2624
i think i got it


[08/13/2021 11:43 PM] Lincoln#2624
idk


[08/13/2021 11:43 PM] Lincoln#2624
we will see


[08/13/2021 11:43 PM] Lincoln#2624
the miner is still bieing wier


[08/13/2021 11:44 PM] andee#4722
if you got 12 vegas that is one beast of a rig


[08/13/2021 11:48 PM] Lincoln#2624
ive got 24 3070s lol


[08/13/2021 11:49 PM] Lincoln#2624

Hey guys


[08/14/2021 7:03 AM] TSNP#1337
Can you recommend me


[08/14/2021 7:03 AM] TSNP#1337
A good PCIe extension? and good risers?


[08/14/2021 7:04 AM] TSNP#1337
Lately all my cables have been breaking or stopping working, it's not an electrical problem since I do have a special installation for the electricity of the mining rigs


[08/14/2021 9:28 AM] apexpool#3878
the sellers seems ok. I explained him the problem, he insists the card was never used. he saw online that the card has still warranty and he said I can take the card to Asus for warranty or send it back to him and he will take it to warranty. I sent it to him, and I'm waiting to see what happens. I have tracking number from DHL. I can make a claim at Paypal until February 2022, in case this is not resolved.


[08/14/2021 9:31 AM] Herk#6019
you opened a case on ebay?


[08/14/2021 9:34 AM] apexpool#3878
no, but I contacted him on ebay. should I open a case on ebay, otherwise I might lose the money?


[08/14/2021 9:36 AM] Herk#6019
yes, if you do it outside ebay you won't be protected...


[08/14/2021 9:37 AM] Herk#6019
if you open a case he would be forced to pay for return postage (since the card is faulty)


[08/14/2021 9:39 AM] Herk#6019
also he would need to refund you once he gets the item


[08/14/2021 9:39 AM] apexpool#3878
I don't find an option to open a case...


[08/14/2021 9:40 AM] apexpool#3878
only to return the item


[08/14/2021 9:40 AM] Herk#6019
well yes.. they changed the naming slightly


[08/14/2021 9:41 AM] Herk#6019
you are essentially returning it because it is faulty, that opens a case on ebay


[08/14/2021 9:41 AM] Herk#6019
it used to be called resolve a problem or something like that, my bad


[08/14/2021 9:42 AM] apexpool#3878
so I should do the return procedure on ebay because the item is faulty


[08/14/2021 9:42 AM] Herk#6019
basically sending it straight to the seller means you trust him to do the right thing, you have no protection from ebay... I guess you can always report him to the police if he refuses to refund you or whatever but imagine the pain


[08/14/2021 9:43 AM] Herk#6019
returning it via ebay ensures you go through their process and can ask ebay to step in if the seller is not helpful or whatever, I assume this is not the case here


[08/14/2021 9:43 AM] apexpool#3878
yes, I have his name and address and I am sure reporting him to the police is very bad for him, as I have the proof that I send the article back to him.


[08/14/2021 9:45 AM] Herk#6019
I don't know how it works in germany but over here in the UK you'd have to take him to court to get your money back (if he refuses to refund), which would be a PITA and extra cost

ebay is straightforward, as soon as the tracking number shows as delivered you instantly get a refund


[08/14/2021 9:46 AM] Herk#6019
sorry, don't want to make you worry for no reason but I never trust random people on the internet üòÑ


[08/14/2021 9:46 AM] apexpool#3878
I'm not sure how it works here, I'm not german, just living here for some years.


[08/14/2021 9:46 AM] Herk#6019
esp. with my money


[08/14/2021 9:47 AM] apexpool#3878
I don't see an option to give a tracking number for the return. I think I will do this (return) and see what happens next.


[08/14/2021 9:48 AM] apexpool#3878
I want the card, if the warranty replaces it or fixes it.


[08/14/2021 9:48 AM] Herk#6019
well.. good luck üëç


[08/14/2021 9:48 AM] apexpool#3878
thanks


[08/14/2021 1:33 PM] issie81#7666
does is matter with ergo to mine with usb stick or ssd?


[08/14/2021 1:44 PM] Pharotek#2932
nope i use both via Hiveos


[08/14/2021 1:48 PM] AeonRemnant#3905
Hey lads, mining Ergo with trex miner and MT on 6 with a 1080 and 1080Ti throws my server PSUs into screamingly loud noise territory for a few seconds only to reset and repeat, has anyone else had problems with that kind of thing?


[08/14/2021 1:48 PM] AeonRemnant#3905
MT *does* push the 1080Ti, for example, from 60MH/s up to 100MH/s, so I know it works.


[08/14/2021 1:48 PM] AeonRemnant#3905
My question is why is the server PSU freaking out so hard at it?


[08/14/2021 2:44 PM] Nythain#6769
Intermittent every 30 to 200 secs by chance?


[08/14/2021 2:46 PM] Nythain#6769
Sounds like cards pushing psu to limit during dag creation possibility.


[08/14/2021 6:01 PM] Galactus#2156
Anyone here actually running a 3090 drawing sub 300w power? I‚Äôm thinking of creating a 3090 rig. Thinking of setting up a rig of 4 or 5


[08/14/2021 8:19 PM] pbr713#9954
So I hooked up another gpu with a pci riser. Powered it back on but I‚Äôm getting no display on my monitor. Does that mean my power supply isn‚Äôt sufficient?


[08/14/2021 8:22 PM] andee#4722
most likely not as the gpu barely uses any power on idle


[08/14/2021 8:23 PM] pbr713#9954
@andee yeah I didn‚Äôt think so. Does it matter how I power it?


[08/14/2021 8:23 PM] pbr713#9954
Not a tech savvy guy so bare with me haha


[08/14/2021 8:24 PM] pbr713#9954
The power that I used had multiple connectors on it. Do i need to use the first one in the line?


[08/14/2021 8:27 PM] andee#4722
I don't get what you are asking. you need to power the riser and the gpu


[08/14/2021 8:27 PM] andee#4722
aah, are you thinking about 2x 6 or 8 pin on the same cable?


[08/14/2021 8:28 PM] pbr713#9954

What ever this is card


[08/14/2021 8:29 PM] pbr713#9954
I plugged into the second in line and not the first


[08/14/2021 8:29 PM] pbr713#9954
Gpu power is a 8 pin to the first card and a 6 pin to the second

It all powers up but no display. Fans were running


[08/14/2021 8:31 PM] pbr713#9954
Hopefully that makes some sense


[08/14/2021 8:32 PM] apexpool#3878
if you have multiple GPUs, you should have signal for monitor from all of them?


[08/14/2021 8:32 PM] apexpool#3878
I never had more than 1, but I thought you have signal only from one.


[08/14/2021 8:35 PM] andee#4722
the gpu is in a x16 slot on the motherboard though, right? not a riser?


[08/14/2021 8:36 PM] pbr713#9954
@andee yes


[08/14/2021 8:37 PM] pbr713#9954
I have a 3060 on the motherboard it self and the other is on the riser. When I remove the riser it works again


[08/14/2021 8:38 PM] andee#4722
how is the riser connected?


[08/14/2021 8:40 PM] pbr713#9954

[08/14/2021 8:42 PM] andee#4722
and you have powered both riser and gpu?


[08/14/2021 8:44 PM] pbr713#9954
Yes


[08/14/2021 8:45 PM] andee#4722
maybe the riser or x1 adapter is faulty


[08/14/2021 8:47 PM] pbr713#9954
@andee yeah I may try another one. But I am ok powering the second gpu from that 6 pin that comes off my first right?


[08/14/2021 8:48 PM] andee#4722
depends on power draw, its not optimal


[08/14/2021 8:49 PM] andee#4722
and sata for the riser is also not really great. if there is a glitch in power limit it may draw too much power for the connector to handle


[08/14/2021 8:50 PM] pbr713#9954
Right on. Yeah I‚Äôm reading now about this all. I think I need to give everything it‚Äôs own home run cables


[08/14/2021 8:51 PM] pbr713#9954

did you mention what is the "other gpu" ?


[08/14/2021 9:20 PM] Herk#6019
3090's aren't great for mining imo, so much maintenance for less efficiency than a 2060 super for example

ergo_white 

[08/14/2021 9:21 PM] Herk#6019
and other cards that you can still buy and aren't lhr


[08/14/2021 9:21 PM] Herk#6019
tbh same goes for the 3080, but that's just me


[08/14/2021 10:39 PM] pbr713#9954
Alright here‚Äôs another question. What is a good number in eff/watt on nbminer?


[08/14/2021 10:40 PM] pbr713#9954
Googled but don‚Äôt really find any answers


[08/15/2021 3:00 AM] ProfessorCA#0140
anyone have issues with trex rcognizing seperate rigs in hiveos?


[08/15/2021 4:46 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
I did consider that, but it's a 7 card rig with 5 3070s, a 1080Ti, and a 1080. It hits about 1KW or so usage and the PSU is a 1600W server PSU.


[08/15/2021 4:46 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
I should have near enough 200 extra watts that it can use before I'd be getting problems like that.


[08/15/2021 6:53 AM] andee#4722
how would t-rex know anything about other rigs?


[08/15/2021 8:53 AM] Lincoln#2624
Any nvidia card is solid


[08/15/2021 8:53 AM] Lincoln#2624
I can‚Äôt get more than 6x Vegas to run simultaneously


[08/15/2021 8:54 AM] Lincoln#2624
No matter mem strap whatever


[08/15/2021 8:54 AM] Lincoln#2624
Max Vega stable hash is 160


[08/15/2021 8:55 AM] Lincoln#2624
3070‚Äôs are worth it


[08/15/2021 8:55 AM] Lincoln#2624
Spend the extra


[08/15/2021 9:09 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
I do already have a 12 card rig of 3070s, it has heaps of issues.


[08/15/2021 9:09 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Namely between 2 and 4 GPUs just randomly dropping out.


[08/15/2021 9:09 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Been working on a fix for it.


[08/15/2021 9:10 AM] Lincoln#2624
Never had problems with mine


[08/15/2021 9:10 AM] Lincoln#2624
Literally never


[08/15/2021 9:38 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Hardware and settings?


[08/15/2021 9:43 AM] Herk#6019
I believe 3070s (non-lhr) should sit somewhere between 1.25-1.45, I'm not sure if there are any other cards that hit such high numbers - maybe Vega 56?


[08/15/2021 9:44 AM] Herk#6019
based on this, if the W is anywhere close to real power draw of those cards, these would be the most efficient (at least ones I've seen so far)


[08/15/2021 9:46 AM] Herk#6019
12 cards on what mb?


[08/15/2021 9:46 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
MSI B360-F Pro.


[08/15/2021 9:46 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
@Herk


[08/15/2021 9:47 AM] Herk#6019
ah, I tend to avoid "mining" stuff, got a few setups with Z390-P and more recently Z490-A


[08/15/2021 9:47 AM] Herk#6019
11 cards each (12 or even 13 might work too)


[08/15/2021 9:48 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
My issue is regardless of currency I'm getting cards dropping fan reporting and temp goes to like... 85c.


[08/15/2021 9:48 AM] Herk#6019
no problems whatsoever (1x PCIe 1x to 4 / 2x M.2 on the Z390 and 2x PCIe 1x to 4 on the Z490)


[08/15/2021 9:48 AM] Herk#6019
sounds like OC issues


[08/15/2021 9:49 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Defo not OC issues.


[08/15/2021 9:49 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
My 2nd rig with 7 cards runs beautifully.


[08/15/2021 9:49 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Same OC.


[08/15/2021 9:50 AM] Herk#6019
again can't talk about that specific mobo but number of cards shouldn't really make much of a difference


[08/15/2021 9:50 AM] Herk#6019
if you believe the OC is fine then the riser could be the next step


[08/15/2021 9:50 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Hmm.


[08/15/2021 9:51 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
On the GPUMining reddit they have a suggested hardware page, I use the same Ubit Risers that're there.


[08/15/2021 9:51 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
I can replace em, though. Have you heard problems with them?


[08/15/2021 9:52 AM] Herk#6019
I use the newer Ver009s ones, would be worth replacing, I haven't heard of this specifically


[08/15/2021 9:53 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Hmm. Mind linking me to them?


[08/15/2021 9:55 AM] Herk#6019
https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/284209541978

this is an example, I believe 009s plus are out now with 8 caps

like this https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/274889021028


[08/15/2021 9:55 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Hmm.


[08/15/2021 9:56 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
I did see some fancier looking ones from GPURisers, they're the white risers.


[08/15/2021 9:56 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
That just a scam, or are they worthwhile?


[08/15/2021 9:56 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
8 caps, so that looks like the 009 ones.


[08/15/2021 9:56 AM] Herk#6019
doubt the "brand" makes any difference to these


[08/15/2021 9:56 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Was more curiosity than anything else.


[08/15/2021 9:57 AM] Herk#6019
I would get the cheapest one as long as the version matches


[08/15/2021 9:57 AM] Herk#6019
forget about the brand in this case


[08/15/2021 9:58 AM] Herk#6019
maybe try one and see if it fixes your issue though before changing all


[08/15/2021 9:58 AM] andee#4722
could be silicon lottery.. one oc is not guaranteed to work on all cards of the same model


[08/15/2021 9:58 AM] Herk#6019
:peepoHide:


[08/15/2021 10:00 AM] Herk#6019
very sad but very true


[08/15/2021 10:02 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
I considered that as well and I've done my mapping.


[08/15/2021 10:02 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
It's not that.


[08/15/2021 10:03 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Cards 3, 5, 7, 9, and sometimes 10 drop out randomly with different degrees of OC, with and without.


[08/15/2021 10:03 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Never drop out at the same time either.


[08/15/2021 10:03 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
So idk. Possible OC, but I've done some pretty long term timing and OC mapping.


[08/15/2021 10:04 AM] Herk#6019
mind sharing your settings?


[08/15/2021 10:04 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Can't atm. Reset everything.


[08/15/2021 10:05 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Used to be around 1100 core, 2600 to 3000 mem depending on card.


[08/15/2021 10:05 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
They all function with 1100 core, but I've also tried 1050 and 1150 core.


[08/15/2021 10:05 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
All permutations of those settings on a per troublesome card basis. Always getting dropouts.


[08/15/2021 10:06 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Also one or two at 1075.


[08/15/2021 10:07 AM] Herk#6019
for ergo, mine sit at 1500/2400


[08/15/2021 10:08 AM] Herk#6019
for eth they‚Äôd be 1100/2400


[08/15/2021 10:08 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Should have mentioned that was Eth, my bad. 
Ergo my cards sit at -502 +2500 to +2800.


[08/15/2021 10:08 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Multi currency issue as well.


[08/15/2021 10:09 AM] Herk#6019
some gigashites don‚Äôt like more than 2400 on mem, having similar issues like the ones you‚Äôre describing


[08/15/2021 10:09 AM] Herk#6019
and I don‚Äôt see much of an improvement in hashrate anyway going above 2400


[08/15/2021 10:09 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Really now?


[08/15/2021 10:09 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Each card for me is pushing something like an extra 6MH/s minimums.


[08/15/2021 10:09 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
And a few of mine hit 180 with those settings.


[08/15/2021 10:10 AM] Herk#6019
well you can give that a try and see how it goes


[08/15/2021 10:10 AM] AeonRemnant#3905
Will test.


[08/15/2021 10:10 AM] Herk#6019
whatever works leave it high


[08/15/2021 10:12 AM] Herk#6019
but 2600+ seems high, not surprised some cards would act up


[08/15/2021 10:13 AM] Herk#6019
180mh on the other hand would be great‚Ä¶ :PepeHands:


[08/15/2021 10:21 AM] AeonRemnant#3905

[08/15/2021 9:48 PM] bbot#6878
I get an error saying the parameters are incorrect

@bbot seems correct to me


[08/15/2021 10:06 PM] andee#4722
did you copy paste the line? quotes seems strange


[08/15/2021 10:07 PM] bbot#6878
No, i typed it out


[08/15/2021 10:07 PM] bbot#6878
Let me try to delete the flightsheet and re-create it


[08/15/2021 10:07 PM] bbot#6878
I had some weirdness on my other rig using ‚Äúdevices‚Äù: and it would throw the same error


[08/15/2021 10:07 PM] bbot#6878
I eventually recreated the flight sheet and it started working


[08/15/2021 10:07 PM] bbot#6878
So odd..


[08/15/2021 10:08 PM] andee#4722
"memory-tweak": "5,5,1,5,5" is what I use


[08/15/2021 10:08 PM] andee#4722
but the quotes on your screen are not the same as I am seeing on my flightsheet


[08/15/2021 10:09 PM] bbot#6878
i‚Äôll try on my desktop


[08/15/2021 10:09 PM] bbot#6878
I tried this on my iphone hive app


[08/15/2021 10:16 PM] andee#4722
iphone default quote is not correct


[08/15/2021 10:16 PM] andee#4722
you need to press and hold then choose the correct one


[08/15/2021 10:18 PM] bbot#6878
that was the issue. i did it on desktop and it's working now

I only have a 3060Ti FE which I struggle to cool, 10-20C difference between that and some of my coolest 3070's

anyone know how to downgrade the driver on HiveOS?


[08/16/2021 4:56 AM] stevo#4238
like, if I want to run the best nivida driver for the 3060 cards?


[08/16/2021 4:58 AM] stevo#4238
I mean, is there something like the 470.05 driver for hiveos? seems when I attempt to overclock on hiveOS, I'm not getting my windows hashrates haha


[08/16/2021 5:07 AM] stevo#4238
nvm-- got it downgrading I think


[08/16/2021 5:07 AM] stevo#4238
now I just gotta figure out the best way to mine on a vega and nvdia at the same time


[08/16/2021 6:27 PM] apexpool#3878
I've got a refund from the seller today, after he received the Vega back from me!
Curious to see what happens with the warranty, he should offer it to me again if they replace it. I have to think if I want it (if they replace it, of course), or I will go with Nvidia...


[08/16/2021 6:34 PM] Herk#6019

Hi, I ask you a question ... Does anyone know how the rewards for mining ergo are related to the number of miners there are? For example, if ETH is no longer mineable, and everyone who was mining Eth goes to mining Erg, how is that going to affect the rewards?


[08/17/2021 1:57 AM] Alan Geisse#7016
Like, the difficulty will increase, but the rewards too? or the ERG price will bump up?


[08/17/2021 2:31 AM] ¬Æjoseph#0904

{\n  "error" : 500,\n  "reason" : "internal.error",\n  "detail" : "Invalid miner state"\n}
Our pool got this error response from node when we submited a solution, could anyone tell me what this error mean?


[08/17/2021 8:50 AM] neal#4344
@andee could you please take a look at this?


[08/17/2021 9:15 AM] geezar#8187
I run mine lower than @andee (less MH/s ofc) - 59-60 MH/s with 1090/1900/825 - power and heat is lower so may be worth trying lower core - some cards are comfortable 'full send' some do not like it - for example regardless what BIOS and straps I use on a specific 470 - will not run > 1240 well. All depends - if the rig is stable at the higher clocks (70-72 MH/s around 1300+ core great)

anyone know how to stop ur 3070ti from randomly kicking into lhr ?

For hours then randomly drop hash to 120


[08/17/2021 9:10 PM] geezar#8187
same, also 3060 LHR was the same - I stick to 175 MH/s 140w on this algo, never dropped for a week +


[08/17/2021 10:09 PM] Herk#6019
182 seems too greedy for that card

whats the difference beetwen mining on herominers or nanopool, 2miners, and mining for example on leafpool or enigmapool? is it better to connect to a big pool like herominers or nanopool, or its a good option leave them and join to leafpool or enigmapool?


[08/18/2021 2:42 AM] danandbeard#2312
y'all ever had and issue with the last card slot always being unstable? crashes every hour or so no matter which card or what clocks I use it seems


[08/18/2021 2:43 AM] danandbeard#2312
asrock b450 pro4 6 slots with 6 vegas


[08/18/2021 2:44 AM] danandbeard#2312
depends on your goals...over a long enough period of time all pools should theoretically payout roughly the same with fees/rewards differing - smaller pools often have little/no fees and some offer rewards to give incentive to use their pool


[08/18/2021 2:52 AM] Camellia#0001
Sometimes yes, I've had my 5700xt die for seemingly no reason because it was the last card in the bundle of 8


[08/18/2021 2:52 AM] Camellia#0001
moved it to the middle, works fine now


[08/18/2021 2:53 AM] danandbeard#2312
did the card you move to replace the last slot stay stable?


[08/18/2021 2:53 AM] danandbeard#2312
I'll try another card I guess, but so far I've tried 2 (maybe 3?) and every time it's the last slot crashing xD


[08/18/2021 3:06 AM] Camellia#0001
the card that is now in the final slot, an rx 480, a sketchy one too, runs fine

ETH and ERG are pretty close in profitability... so if you plan on holding your crypto like I do, don't worry about the .25 cent daily differences

You should do your  own research


[08/18/2021 5:49 PM] Camellia#0001
regarding that stuff, I'll offer advice but you should really do some googling

[08/19/2021 2:33 AM] Serotonina#2676
just when i set up that GPU i get that errors and dont works


[08/19/2021 4:50 AM] Camellia#0001
Card may not properly installed, could be dead PCIE 1x16  adapter, could be many things


[08/19/2021 5:30 AM] Serotonina#2676
its just that specific card, when i quit it the miner runs corretly, and this just happens with nvidia driver 460.39 for linux, if i install 460.80 the card works fine


[08/19/2021 5:31 AM] Serotonina#2676
i tried to reflash the BIOS with another version, 94.06.14.00.5D, for Zotac RTX 3060 12 GB Twin Edge no OC edition


[08/19/2021 5:31 AM] Serotonina#2676
but it says this


[08/19/2021 5:31 AM] Serotonina#2676
match the PCI Device ID of the adapter. Adapter PCI Device ID: 2504 Firmware image PCI Device ID: 2503


[08/19/2021 5:31 AM] Serotonina#2676
hiveos show me this error when i try to flash the BIOS with another version and no the stock version


[08/19/2021 8:01 AM] andee#4722
why are you trying to flash it? the error is very clear, you are trying to flash a bios that wont work


[08/19/2021 10:04 AM] geezar#8187
I only saw this when using **460.39 on LHR V2 3060's ** the V1's are the only GPU's that work, same is true for the WIndows DEV driver


[08/19/2021 10:05 AM] geezar#8187
basically you will not be able to run 460.39 - 460.84 I think I had to use


[08/19/2021 10:06 AM] geezar#8187
I would not be trying to flash that GPU... V2's will not work with that driver and suggests strongly its a V2 LHR model


[08/19/2021 10:09 AM] geezar#8187
I noticed this in a rig of V1's - the one V2 caused the rig to crash or use the later driver - this is due to the V2, as for flashing to a V1... never tried but if it was that easy have to assume everyone would do it - interesting if you get it to work but cannot see it being that easy (converting a V2 into a V1)

[08/19/2021 10:13 AM] geezar#8187
not sure I'm brave enough but depends if the hard coded LHR would brick the GPU - no BIOS switch backup either 2504 to 2503.... ü§î - I stuck with 119MH/s on the V2 on this algo - its annoying as hell not being able to use the .39 driver tho.


[08/19/2021 12:31 PM] nebula#0013
119mh on a v2 is not that bad


[08/19/2021 12:31 PM] nebula#0013
compared to a 125~ of a v1

LHR is too much hassle on the 3060's IMO


[08/19/2021 3:46 PM] nebula#0013
my v1 3060 gets 125 at 110w


[08/19/2021 3:46 PM] geezar#8187
Share your OC settings


[08/19/2021 3:46 PM] geezar#8187
Yep, 122-126 is average on V1's


[08/19/2021 3:47 PM] geezar#8187
even the gigabytes will run 126 MH/s at 110w - in all honesty 122 MH/s at 100w is much more efficient

[08/19/2021 6:21 PM] Camellia#0001
as long as the pool sees a consistent hashrate, what you see doesn't matter, since the pool is paying you, not your rig üòõ


[08/19/2021 6:22 PM] andee#4722
the dips happen every new block, every 120s on average


[08/19/2021 6:22 PM] andee#4722
some miners don't report the dip, but its there on all on them

looks all good poolside, just making sure I wasn't losing anything


[08/19/2021 7:21 PM] Serotonina#2676
with what driver u got that MH/s?


[08/19/2021 8:03 PM] miner29#2975
going to be current driver most likely...as v2s are recognized by older drivers


[08/19/2021 8:22 PM] Serotonina#2676
i tried using 465.31, but im having issues with my RTX 3060 V1 no LHR, im just gettin 103 MH/s with the OC

Page 1-9 of the Asus B250 mining manual shows that in order to get 19 gpus running its must be 8 P106 in the primary + next 7 slots.  Then the other 11 slots must be AMD cards.  Pages 1-9 ~ 1-14 show all the specifics including which high count cards and driver versions that are supported.  For this reason I only ever bothered to get 13 gpus running...and honestly the H110+ mining boards with 13 slots is MUCH more reliable than the B250+ 19 slot boards.  (have a dozen of the H110s in rigs and only 1 B250 left running (3 other B250s died)

12 would also work but for some reason would boot straight to bios which was obviously annoying

i run mainly 13 and 6 gpus rigs‚Ä¶a couple are 8 gpu rigs but those are built on rebtech blades‚Ä¶those are awesome wish i had grabbed more when they were $149 and still available.  (cpu/ram/board was $149 total..add a server psu and go‚Ä¶.mobo onlyuses a single pcie 6 pin!)

30% over power limit on memory is not good‚Ä¶hopefully its a discrete part (capacitor) if you are lucky as these are not a big deal to replace.  If you cant get it to mine remove fan/heatsink and post up a pic of the components.  Look for a part blown apart or just missing its body.  Much easier to fix then burnt traces.

I checked bunch of forums and discussions,  but failed to reach any conclusions. I realize they're locked against ethereum mining, but how many mhs of ergo can i squeeze from them?

Hi all I would like to find out some thing here if any one here with rig building skills can answer.

I have a nightmare rig and trying to trouble shoot but getting no where
So today I bought another motherboard and replaced it. Msi z390-a pro
I have 3070 X 6 on risers
My question is do these riders need to be powered? As who ever build it has only 2 risers powered and 4 on the inside don't but some how still power. Any ideas  if I need to plug them in?


[08/22/2021 2:12 AM] Marc the Shark#2053
Hey everyone looking to get some help on my Vega FE card, does this mean the gpu is dead? I am thinking it needs more voltsge and unable to give it the juice. I tried editting the xinit file in /home/user from hive shell in hiveos. any idea how I can manually set the voltage to the card on start up? or is it bricked?

[08/22/2021 7:59 AM] Camellia#0001
that means that if you lose more than .01% of your hashrate, you're better off with the rejected shares


[08/22/2021 7:59 AM] Jack#3324
First time mining autolykos tryed 3 miners, T-Rex is best with my settings


[08/22/2021 7:59 AM] Camellia#0001
aka, 1mh


[08/22/2021 8:11 AM] callie#3352
what should oc do? core clock or memory clock? or same oc like eth?


[08/22/2021 8:13 AM] Camellia#0001
Similar to ethereum, they usually don't care too much about core clocks and LOVE sky high memory OCs


[08/22/2021 8:17 AM] callie#3352
great so I can lower my core clock and use only memory


[08/22/2021 8:24 AM] Camellia#0001
Depends on the card but some of my 3070s like core more than others


[08/22/2021 8:26 AM] ThomasToka|Serverman Webhosting#5758
I think this is a t-rex bug as i have it also and there is a issue opened on t-rex github.~~ the rejected shares are only client side and not visible on the pool in the specific case.~~


[08/22/2021 8:28 AM] Jack#3324
Yes, I read someting too about T-Rex, I will let it with these settings for now.


[08/22/2021 8:48 AM] Terremot#4855
Better to increase core and lower memory. Better for the card


[08/22/2021 8:49 AM] Terremot#4855
And better heat levels


[08/22/2021 9:22 AM] trex#6765
It's not a t-rex bug. The miner simply conveys the information received from the pool.


[08/22/2021 9:25 AM] ThomasToka|Serverman Webhosting#5758
thx for clarification.. have just read your answer on github.

[08/22/2021 9:25 AM] trex#6765
Those could be stale shares, OC has no effect on them, better check the pool's dashboard


[08/22/2021 9:32 AM] Jack#3324
I checked shares looks like stale, thank you for info. Today I will add my second rig.


[08/22/2021 9:48 AM] callie#3352
is it good for longer term of video card also?


[08/22/2021 9:49 AM] Terremot#4855
Yes. Reduces the strain on the vram


[08/22/2021 10:05 AM] callie#3352
in eth, when I increase core clock and lower vram, the hashrate is the same but I see the accepted hash drops even though the hashrate is the same, is it ergo dependen of vram or on core clock?


[08/22/2021 10:09 AM] Terremot#4855
I have -200 core clock, +1300 mem clock and 58% power limit on 3070. Works nicely for me


[08/22/2021 10:09 AM] Terremot#4855
And after 2 weeks on that rate I have waay under 0.1% rejects


[08/22/2021 10:24 AM] callie#3352
what happens to inactive wallets? I'm planning to hold more than 4 or 6 yrs of ergo and so my wallet for sure inactive that time..

[08/22/2021 10:34 AM] callie#3352
I learn that every 3 month 3 ergo block reward reduce, so we will see block reward like 3 ergo in the future which will make the ergo value increase more likely 1k usd or 2k usd at that time üòÑ and we will be only rewarding 0.1 ergo every miner or even 0.01  just like ethereum haha.


[08/22/2021 10:34 AM] callie#3352
but I'm concern about the inactive wallet, what will happen with it. I'm still confused.


[08/22/2021 10:50 AM] Terremot#4855
I am still to understand it


[08/22/2021 11:09 AM] callie#3352
Yes please share it here if our wallet get destroyed after inactive


[08/22/2021 11:33 AM] Terremot#4855
I have no understanding yet


[08/22/2021 12:25 PM] GaryMcNeish#5547

[08/22/2021 1:42 PM] Terremot#4855
Wallets don't get destroyed, but coins that are out of circulation for more than 4 years get charged storage fees


[08/22/2021 1:42 PM] callie#3352
how many they charged?


[08/22/2021 1:42 PM] Terremot#4855
doesn't say


[08/22/2021 1:42 PM] callie#3352
is it like transaction inactive or opening the wallet?


[08/22/2021 1:43 PM] Terremot#4855
https://fc18.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/bitcoin18-final18.pdf


[08/22/2021 1:43 PM] callie#3352
how to know if wallet is inactive? is it 4 years of not opening the wallet or 4 yrs of transaction inactive?


[08/22/2021 1:43 PM] Terremot#4855
well, each coin has a unique identifier of a sort, I imagine


[08/22/2021 1:44 PM] Terremot#4855
so anything that's inactive in a wallet for more than 4 years will have fees charged


[08/22/2021 1:44 PM] Terremot#4855
all that needs to happen is for the coins to be moved from one wallet to another


[08/22/2021 1:44 PM] Terremot#4855
that's it


[08/22/2021 1:45 PM] Terremot#4855
so if there are any permanently lost coins, they eventually become recovered over time


[08/22/2021 1:45 PM] Terremot#4855
Just need 2 wallets, and shift coin from one to the other


[08/22/2021 1:45 PM] Terremot#4855
and pay the transaction fee


[08/22/2021 1:46 PM] callie#3352
great, so I will hold it on exchange then


[08/22/2021 1:46 PM] Terremot#4855
means there will never be permanently lost coin, like there is with bitcoin


[08/22/2021 1:47 PM] Terremot#4855
Exchange wallet is still a wallet


[08/22/2021 1:47 PM] callie#3352
but that wallet is not inactive


[08/22/2021 1:47 PM] callie#3352
exchange wallet always do transaction.


[08/22/2021 1:47 PM] Terremot#4855
there is always a risk that the exchange wallet can be hacked


[08/22/2021 1:47 PM] callie#3352
yeah true, maybe wallet is safe


[08/22/2021 1:47 PM] callie#3352
or I just need 1 transaction every 4 yrs haha


[08/22/2021 1:48 PM] Terremot#4855
I'm going to invest in 2 hardware wallets


[08/22/2021 1:48 PM] callie#3352
I will hold it on wallet then do 1 transaction then and wait again 4 yrs


[08/22/2021 1:48 PM] Terremot#4855
and switch from one to the other


[08/22/2021 1:48 PM] Terremot#4855
coin value isn't enough yet for me to need to do that


[08/22/2021 1:48 PM] callie#3352
sounds good. Me I only need the paper xD is there possible we can just send it to our another address?


[08/22/2021 1:49 PM] Terremot#4855
from the way it explains in the document, just transfer from one wallet to another before the 4 years are up


[08/22/2021 1:49 PM] Terremot#4855
and your erg are safe


[08/22/2021 1:50 PM] callie#3352
ok thats good, how about 1 transaction? like I will send only 0.001 ergo to exchange so that my wallet will have transaction. is that good also? that way they my wallet is not inactive since I have transaction


[08/22/2021 1:51 PM] Terremot#4855
"In Ergo, in addition to transaction fees, miners will also be able to collect storage rent fees on UTXOs that have not been moved for four years or more."


[08/22/2021 1:51 PM] Terremot#4855
sounds like it means the coin has to be active, not the wallet


[08/22/2021 1:52 PM] callie#3352
I think this is because the mining rewards reduce to 3 every 3 months so the miners will need to continue mining then. That's really good.


[08/22/2021 1:52 PM] callie#3352
I see the mining block rewards reduced every 3 months, so that miners will have compensation too to continue mining even the rewars is reduce every 3 months


[08/22/2021 1:53 PM] Terremot#4855
By 3, not to 3


[08/22/2021 1:54 PM] Terremot#4855
think the block reward decrease starts next year in earnest


[08/22/2021 1:54 PM] Terremot#4855
and by 2023, the block reward will be at around 54


[08/22/2021 1:54 PM] callie#3352
what do you mean by 3?


[08/22/2021 1:55 PM] callie#3352
I though mining rewards per every block every 3 months reduce 3 ergo coin


[08/22/2021 1:55 PM] Terremot#4855
current reward is 67.5


[08/22/2021 1:55 PM] Terremot#4855
next reward, if reduced by 3, it will be approx 64.5


[08/22/2021 1:56 PM] Terremot#4855
otherwise, block reward would be 67.5 now and then in January it would be 3


[08/22/2021 1:56 PM] Terremot#4855
which is extremely drastic


[08/22/2021 1:58 PM] callie#3352
see this live chart https://ergo.watch/emission

[08/22/2021 1:59 PM] callie#3352
right now we only have 41 days and the mining block rewards will decrease again to 3 ergo


[08/22/2021 1:59 PM] Terremot#4855
yes, that's "by" 3, not "to" 3


[08/22/2021 1:59 PM] callie#3352
so it will be 64.5


[08/22/2021 1:59 PM] Terremot#4855
it's a terminology problem


[08/22/2021 1:59 PM] callie#3352
I'm sorry I still not understand it.


[08/22/2021 1:59 PM] Terremot#4855
If you say the block reward is reduced to 3, then that means the next block reward is 3 ergo


[08/22/2021 2:00 PM] callie#3352
oh sorry about that, I get it now


[08/22/2021 2:00 PM] callie#3352
yes , by 3 not 3 xD


[08/22/2021 2:00 PM] callie#3352
sorry my bad english xD


[08/22/2021 2:00 PM] Terremot#4855
That's ok.  I wanted to make sure you understood


[08/22/2021 2:01 PM] callie#3352
Thank you for the explanation.


[08/22/2021 2:01 PM] Terremot#4855
If you said to someone else that the reward was dropping to 3, they'd be shocked


[08/22/2021 2:01 PM] Terremot#4855
that would be less than eth block rewards just before eip1559


[08/22/2021 2:02 PM] Terremot#4855
The approach from the devs is much better than the devs from Ethereum


[08/22/2021 2:02 PM] callie#3352
yes, I'm shocked too, I didn't see that xD anyway I don't understand it, when reducing it. What will happen if the reward is 0 since the reward every 3 months reduce by 3.


[08/22/2021 2:02 PM] Marc the Shark#2053
Yeah I did try running at stock with no OC with no luck


[08/22/2021 2:03 PM] Terremot#4855
You will still get ergo, just not the bonus amount


[08/22/2021 2:04 PM] Terremot#4855
the reward is shared between the miners that unlocked the block


[08/22/2021 2:04 PM] Terremot#4855
so on large pools, you get a small share of the block reward


[08/22/2021 2:04 PM] Terremot#4855
mining solo, you get the full share


[08/22/2021 2:05 PM] Terremot#4855
but you have to find the block first


[08/22/2021 2:05 PM] Terremot#4855
and that can take a month or more to find


[08/22/2021 2:05 PM] callie#3352
yes, but still I don't understand it about the reward, what I know is that when mining we get rewards for mining, what will happen if the rewars started to 0.


[08/22/2021 2:06 PM] Terremot#4855
a block is worth x amount of ergo


[08/22/2021 2:06 PM] Terremot#4855
plus at the moment, the reward is an extra 67.5 ergo


[08/22/2021 2:06 PM] Terremot#4855
when it goes to zero, you still get the value of the block


[08/22/2021 2:06 PM] Terremot#4855
just not the extra


[08/22/2021 2:07 PM] callie#3352
oh I get it now, so the block reward which is 67.5 is only extra or bonus reward


[08/22/2021 2:07 PM] Terremot#4855
yeah


[08/22/2021 2:07 PM] callie#3352
how about the true block reward, what is the stated block reward without extra bonus.


[08/22/2021 2:07 PM] Terremot#4855
I don't know


[08/22/2021 2:08 PM] Terremot#4855
aah...I might be wrong


[08/22/2021 2:08 PM] Terremot#4855
"The Ergo block interval is 2 minutes and for the first 2 years, each block will release a total of 75 Ergs to be shared between the miners and the Treasury (Treasury discussed below). But starting at year 2, the rate of emission will fall by 3.0 Ergs and thereafter further decline every 3 months by an additional 3.0 Ergs, which will result in an end to emission 8 years after launch."


[08/22/2021 2:08 PM] callie#3352
great, thanks for the answer, I get it now . But I'm excited on this one, I'm happy that ethereum going to POS 2.0 which we will have another candidate ergo to become the top mining coin.


[08/22/2021 2:09 PM] Terremot#4855
I am wrong and you were right


[08/22/2021 2:09 PM] Terremot#4855
when the reward becomes zero, there are no more ergo to mine


[08/22/2021 2:09 PM] callie#3352
yeah, that means on 2029, that time we will have 2 bull run, one for 2024 bull run and second bull run on 2027 haha


[08/22/2021 2:09 PM] Terremot#4855
ergo started in 2017


[08/22/2021 2:09 PM] callie#3352
wow, what will be the case then? who will be validating the transaction


[08/22/2021 2:10 PM] Terremot#4855
don't know, I haven't read that far ahead


[08/22/2021 2:10 PM] Terremot#4855
for now, I'm earning


[08/22/2021 2:10 PM] Terremot#4855
and learning


[08/22/2021 2:10 PM] Jack#3324
When transactions rise does the block reward rise too like eth?


[08/22/2021 2:10 PM] callie#3352
yeah, let's enjoy it now since the ergo is on low marketcap. soon we will have answer on this.


[08/22/2021 2:10 PM] Terremot#4855
not as far as I know


[08/22/2021 2:10 PM] callie#3352
no,


[08/22/2021 2:10 PM] Terremot#4855
there is no gas fee like eth


[08/22/2021 2:11 PM] Terremot#4855
just a small transaction fee


[08/22/2021 2:11 PM] Jack#3324
ok thanks


[08/22/2021 2:11 PM] Terremot#4855
relies mostly on trading pressure, as far as I'm aware.


[08/22/2021 2:11 PM] Terremot#4855
I may be wrong


[08/22/2021 2:11 PM] Terremot#4855
But that's what I have observed so far


[08/22/2021 2:12 PM] Terremot#4855
If I'm proved wrong, I will admit to being wrong


[08/22/2021 2:12 PM] Terremot#4855
as I already have done

[08/22/2021 4:29 PM] Alien Œ£ Crypto#4489
After 4 years of no activity your wallet will start paying tax/fees. This is done so that wallets with lost keys will never just sit like btc. Actually is smart idea.


[08/22/2021 4:32 PM] Dominator#2192
And what do you think about my settings ?

transaction fees and storage rent


[08/22/2021 6:34 PM] Terremot#4855

[08/22/2021 6:39 PM] Terremot#4855
So it in effect becomes PoS?


[08/22/2021 6:40 PM] andee#4722
how did you arrive at that conclusion?


[08/22/2021 6:40 PM] Terremot#4855
well, it can't be PoW once there's no more mining income


[08/22/2021 6:41 PM] andee#4722
yes it can. miners will be paid the transaction fees and storage rent


[08/22/2021 6:41 PM] Terremot#4855
This is what I'm trying to understand


[08/22/2021 6:41 PM] Terremot#4855
So miners will still need to mine to get the transaction fees and storage rent?


[08/22/2021 6:42 PM] andee#4722
yes, in the same way that if you don't mine now you wont get block reward or fees


[08/22/2021 6:42 PM] Terremot#4855
aah


[08/22/2021 6:42 PM] Terremot#4855
I see


[08/22/2021 6:42 PM] andee#4722
there is no end of mining


[08/22/2021 6:42 PM] andee#4722
only end of block rewards


[08/22/2021 6:43 PM] Terremot#4855
and the fees paid will depend on the amount of mining done


[08/22/2021 6:44 PM] andee#4722
say you lose the seed to a wallet you have 10ERG in, after 4 years of being inactive small amounts will be taken from that over time and paid to miners


[08/22/2021 6:45 PM] andee#4722
the fees depend on how congested the network is and how fast people want it confirmed. it has nothing to do with how many miners there are


[08/22/2021 6:45 PM] Terremot#4855
right


[08/22/2021 6:45 PM] Terremot#4855
I've understood as much as I can right now


[08/22/2021 6:45 PM] Terremot#4855
Probably will need more clarification later


[08/22/2021 6:46 PM] Terremot#4855
but later may be in a year's time or 5


[08/22/2021 6:46 PM] Terremot#4855
isn't too much to be concerned about right now


[08/22/2021 6:46 PM] Terremot#4855
thanks


[08/22/2021 7:12 PM] callie#3352
so the fees is like eth gas, that's good then, I'm supporting it and that would be on 2029, 2029 we will have reduce ergo block rewards and only transaction fees only send to miners and I predict that the price of ergo of 2029 might be around 5k usd or even more most likely 15k usd per ergo.


[08/22/2021 7:22 PM] andee#4722
there are ~6 more years of block rewards


[08/22/2021 11:13 PM] Andre05#9319
Hi everyone! I am ethereum miner. However, i am eyeing mining ergo right now because it's impossible to buy a non lhr videocard. I found statistics of 3060 ti lhr on minerstat, which looks quite promising. Maybe by any chance you know anybody who actually mine ergo on lhr videocard? How many mgs of ergo do you get from lhr card? I have read that there are two generations of those cards, and second is blocked against ergo. Is it true?


[08/23/2021 12:06 AM] aymanstake#0976
@Canberry @Camellia  thanks for your tips, I was able to get my vega 56 upto 200Mhz and the best I have seen is 205 but I don't want to push my card too hard but I still want to optimize to reduce power and temps a bit more if anyone has any suggestions

Hi everyone, I have just now started mining Ergo, for a change,  after having been on ETH until now.
One thing I am noticing is that the miner (TRM on HiveOS n my case) keeps recreating tables after every few minutes during which the Hashrate drops to almost half & then it gets back to its peak again. This is cyclical & I am pretty sure it is going to affect my overall average hashrate.
Is there something that I am doing wrong of is it just the way Ergo mining works?
Doesn't this mean that whatever daily earning data is shown on whattomine for ergo is going to be substantially more than actual earnings due to this constant recreation of tables & fall in hashrate?


[08/23/2021 5:31 AM] Camellia#0001
Nope! The dag gets recreated for every single block, this is an anti-asic measure to make sure the network is not dominated by asics


[08/23/2021 5:33 AM] kunal88del#9665
Thanks for the reply. So, the anti-asic measure of dag regeneration is NOT going to affect the average hashrate on the long run?
And the estimated earnings on whattomine are spot on for ergo?


[08/23/2021 5:35 AM] Camellia#0001
You aren't hashing while the dag is being created so you aren't mining. All ergo miners have to do this, but some don't report it


[08/23/2021 5:35 AM] Camellia#0001
TRM reports the dag generation as a dip


[08/23/2021 5:37 AM] kunal88del#9665
Since this is inherent to Ergo, so it wouldn't make a difference if some miner reports it or not, right ? And one can use any compatible miner for Ergo without any substantial difference in output?


[08/23/2021 5:41 AM] Canberry#7404
the only difference in output would be due to how well tuned the miner is


[08/23/2021 5:41 AM] Canberry#7404
like TRM is great at utilizing vega cards


[08/23/2021 5:41 AM] Canberry#7404
but they still need to stop for dag generation

Been working on fine tuning my 3070‚Äôs. Got them down to 120w at 171 mh/s. Has anyone gotten power lower without compromising hash power? Looks like a lot of the people in the pinned response page are running 130+ w

Anything below 120 you sacrifice hash

And why it's always fluctuate? Not stable like ethash. My 3070 fluctuate between 140 and 170mhs


[08/24/2021 9:49 AM] Dediou#0611
@fay hello, a good setting for 3060ti 3070 is 1600core 2450mem 135power, got a stable 170-171mh on all of them with TREX


[08/24/2021 9:50 AM] Dediou#0611
135power is just general overhead, they all have their sweet spot between 119 to 135 depending on the card


[08/24/2021 9:59 AM] fay#5512
Ok just switch to trex now. For few minutes it's better than lolminer. I'll wait for one hour


[08/24/2021 9:59 AM] fay#5512
My overall hashrate fluctuate between 900mhs-1.02ghs in lolminer


[08/24/2021 10:01 AM] Dediou#0611
there is a difference between what the miner shows and what the pool register. Maybe nothing is wrong with lolminer even if the readings are all over the place, i just find trex more stable and easier to read


[08/24/2021 10:36 AM] geezar#8187
pinned items contains a community driven google sheet with many GPU's compare yours good place to start


[08/24/2021 10:37 AM] geezar#8187
I use lolminer on 3060's - worth testing all of the miners IMO as all differ depending on the GPU's


[08/24/2021 10:58 AM] fay#5512
Thanks. Didn‚Äôt realise pinned message got all GPU ergo hashrate


[08/24/2021 10:59 AM] fay#5512

[08/24/2021 1:56 PM] geezar#8187
@apexpool would be very happy to be corrected but suspect thats a misleading 'V1' the community uses the V1/V2 to describe the 1st Gen 3060's... 130 give or take or 170 if its a true non-LHR which the site does not suggest, marketting - gotta love it


[08/24/2021 1:59 PM] geezar#8187
Windows issue - google will help if its related to that, as per my question however can you access your network/other apps have network access (only the miners not working?)


[08/24/2021 2:04 PM] apexpool#3878
it is LHR. So what community understand by "V1" is actually pre-LHR, not what Gainward understands here by V1. 
the V2 has the same estimated hashrate for ETH on this website. thanks!

[08/24/2021 3:56 PM] andee#4722
yes, I guess some miner devs smooth the values to make it seem like they are faster or more stable

[08/24/2021 6:50 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
what city/electricity provider?


[08/24/2021 6:50 PM] .Lily#8358
¬£0.193, greater manchester


[08/24/2021 6:50 PM] .Lily#8358
idk the provider name


[08/24/2021 6:51 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
yeah thats why im wondering if its even worth hooking up the old 1060 3gb


[08/24/2021 6:51 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389

[08/24/2021 6:52 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
whats the (dis)advantages of using different pools exactly?


[08/24/2021 6:53 PM] .Lily#8358
as far as i can tell, higher latency = more stales = less money
that, combined with different pool fees. 0-3% is normal, and honestly if ur on the scale of using ur gaming pc for mining, 3% is not noticable


[08/24/2021 6:53 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
well theres a couple pools for ergo with 0 fees rn

[08/24/2021 6:54 PM] .Lily#8358
oh thats another difference


[08/24/2021 6:54 PM] .Lily#8358
is like


[08/24/2021 6:54 PM] .Lily#8358
minimum payouts


[08/24/2021 6:54 PM] .Lily#8358
and uhh


[08/24/2021 6:54 PM] .Lily#8358
like time it'll take to get a payout


[08/24/2021 6:54 PM] .Lily#8358
you see the less populated pools have much more infrequent payouts


[08/24/2021 6:55 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
thing is that im not mining with nicehash, im mining ergo lol


[08/24/2021 6:55 PM] .Lily#8358
if the diference between 0 and 1% for you is the difference between like. ¬£1000 / ¬£990 at the end of the year, i'd just ignore it


[08/24/2021 6:56 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
i know. the 0% ones also have lower payout mins and much less total hashrate (ik that over time that shouldnt make much a different to earnings)


[08/24/2021 6:56 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
so it doesn't really matter then?


[08/24/2021 6:57 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
lower payouts sounds good i guess, takes 3/4 days of mining to get the min payout of herominers


[08/24/2021 6:57 PM] .Lily#8358
for you and i, i dont think it matters enough for us to bother with it


[08/24/2021 6:57 PM] .Lily#8358
but if u eventually scale up, you should read into it and minmax


[08/24/2021 6:58 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
is it even worth scaling up with stupid ass gpu prices nowadays?


[08/24/2021 6:59 PM] .Lily#8358
that descision is for you to gamble on :) personally im not scaling up until like. 40 series comes out, and my "scaling up" will simply be moving my 3080ti into the mining rig , and putting a 4090 into my main rig, and continuing to mine on both rigs


[08/24/2021 6:59 PM] .Lily#8358
hopefully i can score a 4090 at (or near) MSRP .


[08/24/2021 7:00 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
aye, i blew a months paycheck on the 3070 and a r7 5800x now though so i dont know how financially wise it would be for a uni student to be investing more several hundred in mining xd


[08/24/2021 7:00 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
ill invest in the coin next payday though i think..


[08/24/2021 7:01 PM] .Lily#8358
i bought a 3080TI at scalper prices and didnt even consider mining until a friend said that if i just ran nicehash until the 4090 comes out, i'd probably be able to afford it


[08/24/2021 7:01 PM] .Lily#8358
and then a couple weeks ago i bought   a 3060TI purely for mining (and keeping my bed warm at night <3 )


[08/24/2021 7:02 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
at scalper prices? fucking hell


[08/24/2021 7:02 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
its been dropped a few times in the last 2 months or so at rrp


[08/24/2021 7:02 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
got the 3070 rrp


[08/24/2021 7:03 PM] .Lily#8358
i mean, ¬£1700 for the 3080TI


[08/24/2021 7:03 PM] .Lily#8358
and


[08/24/2021 7:03 PM] .Lily#8358
¬£700 for the 3060TI


[08/24/2021 7:03 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
fuck


[08/24/2021 7:03 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
480 quid for 3070


[08/24/2021 7:03 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
mate youre being done


[08/24/2021 7:03 PM] .Lily#8358
ROI on the 3060ti: about 200 days probably
ROI on the 3080tI: in my dreams


[08/24/2021 7:03 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
to be fair you can only buy a card at rrp once


[08/24/2021 7:03 PM] .Lily#8358
ive been there spamming refresh on a bunch of sites for the launch of every card.


[08/24/2021 7:03 PM] .Lily#8358
and at restock times


[08/24/2021 7:03 PM] .Lily#8358

i was on every fgucking stockalert possible  i literally even joined some for ps5's for my brother because he wanted one, i managed to get him a ps5 before i got myself a gpu


[08/24/2021 7:05 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
doom is fast af, so low fps for what i think is minimal gains when youre in the heat of combat sucks


[08/24/2021 7:05 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
tbf i am playing power limited 65% still


[08/24/2021 7:05 PM] .Lily#8358
oh


[08/24/2021 7:05 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
but visually, its better but not amazingly so


[08/24/2021 7:05 PM] .Lily#8358
3080TI i dont put a power limit on it, 200+fps with RTX + DLSS


[08/24/2021 7:06 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
if you can get 100+ fps with rtx on then go for it


[08/24/2021 7:06 PM] .Lily#8358
RTX drops framerate from 220 to 90-110, 
DLSS increases it back to 200ish


[08/24/2021 7:06 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
i play doom eternal on hardest diff. and shit is fast as fuck, maybe its less fast on the normal ones where you can actually enjoy it and im just a niche player


[08/24/2021 7:06 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
what i will say..


[08/24/2021 7:06 PM] .Lily#8358
oh no i nightmare mode it

oh yeah you aint noticing shit when youre weapon switching like a mf then


[08/24/2021 7:06 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
but if you do 100fps rtx then fucking go for it üòÇ


[08/24/2021 7:07 PM] .Lily#8358
:doom_inc:


[08/24/2021 7:07 PM] .Lily#8358
when you press the glory kill button and ur fps goes from 200 to 400


[08/24/2021 7:07 PM] .Lily#8358
very cool :sunglasses:


[08/24/2021 7:07 PM] yumpoopsoup#1389
wait it does?


[08/24/2021 7:07 PM] .Lily#8358
yeah, i think glory kills are so much less intensive than actual gameplay


[08/24/2021 7:09 PM] .Lily#8358
anyway, best of luck with ur mining, try not to spend too much time minmaxing for 0.001%'s that you'll lose on a hot sunny day :) its much more rewarding to set and forget it and you check ur balance once a week ;)


[08/24/2021 7:09 PM] .Lily#8358

[08/24/2021 9:27 PM] Jack#3324
Would you use 2 cables from PSU to power one 3080ti? Corsair PCE cables have 2x 8 pin but I would rather connect 2 cables then one with 2x 8 pins.

And also 3070 diversify risk can be used to mine other shit just in case you wanna switch

you would have to try, most use gpu's

I think you can mine Monero with the CPU. It's pointless to try mining Ergo with the CPU.

yes I know, we need to divide by 2.  buy im using hiveos.


[08/25/2021 7:35 PM] andee#4722
then you just need to lower it since your card can't handle it

80ti - +175 Core /-200 Mem and PL 130 FOR 101 MH/s at 125w - 225w a little on the high side üò±


[08/25/2021 7:51 PM] callie#3352
do you mind explaining it to me, in ethereum I use negative core clock which is -502 and I got super heat, In ergo It's plus +1150


[08/25/2021 7:51 PM] callie#3352
what is the use core clock?


[08/25/2021 7:51 PM] callie#3352
coreclock and the memory clock is + to me, can you explain to me the usage of both on ergo


[08/25/2021 7:54 PM] geezar#8187
TBH there are more readme and support files in SRB than any other miner I've seen üôÇ

1150 is probably absolute core clock, not offset


[08/25/2021 8:02 PM] callie#3352
yes, absolute core clock, is that ok?


[08/25/2021 8:02 PM] callie#3352
my temp drastically drop


[08/25/2021 8:02 PM] callie#3352
and the power usage drastically drop too from 128 power usage to 98 power usage


[08/25/2021 8:14 PM] Ananas#9063
any idea what it means when a 16x slot can be set to 4x4x4x4 mode in the bios?


[08/25/2021 8:14 PM] Ananas#9063
All I know is if I do that, then it wont see the GPU inserted into it


[08/25/2021 8:15 PM] Terremot#4855
core clock is used for re-generating the dag, which happens a lot more than in eth.  Memory clock can also be used lower than eth too


[08/25/2021 8:18 PM] callie#3352
but is that ok on my core clock? my coreclock is higher now from -502 to +1020 and the memory clock is the same from the ethereum settings.


[08/25/2021 8:19 PM] Terremot#4855
core clock of +1020 would crash the card instantly


[08/25/2021 8:19 PM] callie#3352
oh, I will lower it now


[08/25/2021 8:19 PM] callie#3352
recommended core clock?


[08/25/2021 8:19 PM] Terremot#4855
if it's an aboslute of 1020, it could be different


[08/25/2021 8:19 PM] Terremot#4855
what card is it?

its 2060 super


[08/25/2021 8:20 PM] callie#3352
any recommended settings on this one


[08/25/2021 8:20 PM] Terremot#4855
ah, that's an absolute core clock


[08/25/2021 8:20 PM] callie#3352
my heat have decrease and the power usage is also decrease.


[08/25/2021 8:20 PM] Terremot#4855
might be ok at that


[08/25/2021 8:20 PM] Terremot#4855
try dropping the power


[08/25/2021 8:20 PM] callie#3352
great, If that's the case I will leave it since the heat gone drop and the power usage gone drop too.


[08/25/2021 8:20 PM] callie#3352
yeah the power drop from 125 watts to 98 watts


[08/25/2021 8:21 PM] Terremot#4855
20 series in my experience isn't as power efficient on erg


[08/25/2021 8:21 PM] Terremot#4855
had a 2080 super and could do 90mhs on 98W


[08/25/2021 8:21 PM] Terremot#4855
so sold it to an eth miner


[08/25/2021 8:21 PM] callie#3352
wow, my card can only hash 84 on 96 watts


[08/25/2021 8:22 PM] callie#3352
yep, I will try to sell it and buy lhr card.


[08/25/2021 8:22 PM] Terremot#4855
didn't get as much I would have liked but it was a gaming card originally


[08/25/2021 8:22 PM] Terremot#4855
and...it meant my ROI wasn't as high for my rig


[08/25/2021 8:23 PM] callie#3352
actually didn't have any roi yet xD


[08/25/2021 8:23 PM] callie#3352
maybe next year is my roi haha


[08/25/2021 8:23 PM] Terremot#4855
going to cash out my eth at some point


[08/25/2021 8:23 PM] callie#3352
already cash out eth and then swap it to ergo xD


[08/25/2021 8:24 PM] Terremot#4855
nah...just cash it out for ROI


[08/25/2021 8:24 PM] Terremot#4855
otherwise it gets too complicated for tax


[08/25/2021 8:24 PM] callie#3352
next time we will mine 1 ergo on 1 month


[08/25/2021 8:24 PM] callie#3352
yeah, in my country they will not know about the crypto tax.


[08/25/2021 8:24 PM] callie#3352
they can't implement it and they don't know how to track


[08/25/2021 8:25 PM] callie#3352
the only way they will know if we declare it on anual tax


[08/25/2021 8:25 PM] Terremot#4855
I could go under the radar for mining, but I'd prefer to declare it


[08/25/2021 8:25 PM] callie#3352
unfortunately here in my country they can't radar it and also my mining rig is not so huge, only little miner


[08/25/2021 8:25 PM] Terremot#4855
besides, this tax year, I'm highly unlikely to ROI


[08/25/2021 8:26 PM] callie#3352
that's sad on you're country, hope you can roi soon


[08/25/2021 8:26 PM] Terremot#4855
oh, that means I won't have to pay tax on my erg


[08/25/2021 8:26 PM] Terremot#4855
expenditure higher than income


[08/25/2021 8:27 PM] Terremot#4855
profits will happen after mining


[08/25/2021 8:27 PM] callie#3352
here I will hold ergo for 4 years, not going to sell.


[08/25/2021 8:27 PM] Terremot#4855
so will only have to pay capital gains tax


[08/25/2021 8:27 PM] Terremot#4855
tax on invested items only gets paid after it's cashed


[08/25/2021 8:28 PM] Terremot#4855
so if it crashes and is worthless, I pay no tax


[08/25/2021 8:28 PM] Terremot#4855
if it does really well, I pay 20% on the profit


[08/25/2021 8:28 PM] callie#3352
yes, thanks here they will not know about crypto, unless we declare tax here in my country , they will not know xD


[08/25/2021 8:28 PM] callie#3352
it's unlikely the ergo crash again .


[08/25/2021 8:29 PM] callie#3352
right now ergo is having spotlight on other people


[08/25/2021 8:29 PM] Terremot#4855
Always a possibility...either way, I won't lose a lot of money


[08/25/2021 8:30 PM] Terremot#4855
always look at the worst case scenario and be prepared for that


[08/25/2021 8:30 PM] Terremot#4855
that way, anything else is great


[08/25/2021 8:30 PM] callie#3352
yep, mine is I don't care about the money on my portpolio since that money is extra right now and the roi on my rig, I don't even think about it


[08/25/2021 8:30 PM] callie#3352
yes, I hope this ergo become like ethereum price, last time I encounter eth is 17 usd 2017 that time


[08/25/2021 8:31 PM] callie#3352
so this ergo, I will not sell it and hold it for years.


[08/25/2021 8:31 PM] Terremot#4855
nobody knows how this is going to work


[08/25/2021 8:31 PM] callie#3352
yep, but I trust this coin.


[08/25/2021 8:31 PM] Terremot#4855
hopefully I can sell a couple of erg next year to recover the cost of buying the rig


[08/25/2021 8:31 PM] Terremot#4855
so I'm hoping that erg will be at 1k by then.  Unlikely but possible


[08/25/2021 8:33 PM] callie#3352
that would be possible since the marketcap is low and the supply of coin is only 97 million and also the coin is not unlimited üòÑ


[08/25/2021 8:34 PM] Terremot#4855
the market cap can work for or against ergo


[08/25/2021 9:25 PM] Ananas#9063
@andee just got a new asus dual 580 4gb, but it refuses to go above 111 watts during mining, cant get it above 49 mh/s. memory load is only 50% compared to the sapphire nitro+ which is at 75% while doing 73 megahash. any ideas?


[08/25/2021 9:27 PM] andee#4722
if that 111W is driver reported that is very high


[08/25/2021 9:27 PM] Ananas#9063
gpu-z


[08/25/2021 9:27 PM] Ananas#9063
my nitro+ runs at 120 watts normall, 75 mh


[08/25/2021 9:27 PM] andee#4722
did you bios mod?


[08/25/2021 9:27 PM] Ananas#9063
i bought it used, but BIOS version is the same as the nitro +


[08/25/2021 9:27 PM] Ananas#9063
so i dont think it was modded


[08/25/2021 9:27 PM] andee#4722
again, 120W reported by driver is very high. that means 150-160W at wall


[08/25/2021 9:28 PM] andee#4722
you need to undervolt


[08/25/2021 9:28 PM] Ananas#9063
afterburner doesnt show voltage for either


[08/25/2021 9:28 PM] Ananas#9063
idk why. it does for nvidia cards


[08/25/2021 9:29 PM] Ananas#9063
any other way?


[08/25/2021 9:29 PM] andee#4722
I used radeon software on my desktop


[08/25/2021 9:29 PM] Ananas#9063
okay I will try that. can i ask which driver ur using?


[08/25/2021 9:30 PM] andee#4722
but how did you confirm the bios? did you compare the checksum?


[08/25/2021 9:30 PM] Ananas#9063
i just compared the bios number in GPU-Z


[08/25/2021 9:30 PM] Ananas#9063
it ended with something like 0002.0001


[08/25/2021 9:30 PM] andee#4722
not possible to compare that way


[08/25/2021 9:31 PM] Ananas#9063
how should I check? I will look into bios modding, never tried it dont know anything about it


[08/25/2021 9:31 PM] andee#4722
and I don't know what driver I use, I use whatever is the latest on my gaming pc


[08/25/2021 9:32 PM] andee#4722
you have to dump the bios, there are plenty guides out there


[08/25/2021 9:32 PM] Ananas#9063
yep i will defo look into it rn


[08/25/2021 9:33 PM] andee#4722
just dump the original as backup, then modify straps and flash back


[08/25/2021 9:33 PM] Ananas#9063
okay, thanks for the quick help, I will troubleshoot it and learn about modding bios

Polaris I run reported 74-76w (102w at the wall) for 65 MH/s as a comparison - 580s, 470 can run a lot lower more 90-95 at the wall depending on clocks in my experience


[08/25/2021 11:20 PM] geezar#8187
@andee is the Polaris guru around here however sure he can help get that power (+ heat) down

[08/25/2021 11:57 PM] bbot#6878
what absolute clock works well with 3070's? i see most people doing -500 offset, but is there an absolute clock setting that people found works well?


[08/26/2021 12:10 AM] andee#4722
I am sure you will get some pointers from the spreadsheet


[08/26/2021 12:35 AM] bbot#6878
I've tried a few of the absolute cores listed in the spreadsheet with very different results :\


[08/26/2021 7:22 AM] geezar#8187
Still testing, daily for 2 weeks... some like no offset, some do - locked ranges 1000-1400 seem common all a case of continued testing, when you find out let me know üòÑ

Cable management and making the rig easy to work on long term is a good idea, just basic cable ties / velcro straps to make the cable runs clean are a good idea too

Length and runs of the power cables (to all 6 GPU's eventually) are important - make sure you run them/cable management with enough to get there + never use SATA to power risers (I have had no issues but frowned upon) - also risers sometimes are a hit and miss, sometimes 1 out of a batch is DOA - nowadays this is less likely but just mentioning

just flashed this super tiny, one fan sapphire pulse mini ITX edition. should I flash it again and change some power options, or is it just that weaker of a card?


[08/26/2021 12:42 PM] Ananas#9063
with -30 PL it does 57 mh/s with 83 watts displayed


[08/26/2021 12:45 PM] andee#4722
undervolt amd cards, from what I see there its 119W at 65? max should be 80-90W reported from driver at those setting if undervolted


[08/26/2021 12:45 PM] andee#4722
except for when creating dataset


[08/26/2021 12:46 PM] Ananas#9063
can I undervolt in polaris?


[08/26/2021 12:46 PM] andee#4722
yes

are those gpu mV values right?


[08/26/2021 12:47 PM] Ananas#9063

[08/26/2021 4:24 PM] .Lily#8358
asking out of curiosity, whats the point in having a minimum balance for payment in mining pools?  does it benefit the pool in some way ?


[08/26/2021 4:29 PM] andee#4722
if there was no minimum the pool would be paying you every round of payments


[08/26/2021 4:30 PM] andee#4722
some pools runs payout every hour, so that would be 24 payments a day as long as the pool mines blocks consistently


[08/26/2021 4:32 PM] miner29#2975
depends on the coin and cost to send as well


[08/26/2021 4:32 PM] andee#4722
for sure


[08/26/2021 4:45 PM] Ananas#9063
tbh I'm sure a lot of them set a bit higher payout limit than they would need to, in order to get free money from the addresses that hobby miners use for a couple days then abandon


[08/26/2021 4:46 PM] Ananas#9063
so when they eventually shut down they have a bunch of addresses with 5-10 usd on them unclaimed, or even if they dont shut down it's good for having money in the hot wallet for big withdrawals


[08/26/2021 4:54 PM] Jack#3324

[08/26/2021 5:28 PM] Ananas#9063
as long as it's not nano its fine


[08/26/2021 5:29 PM] Lupus#3303
noted


[08/26/2021 5:29 PM] Lupus#3303
So hero says it will pay you every time you mine 1 ERG right?


[08/26/2021 5:29 PM] .Lily#8358
whats wrong with nano


[08/26/2021 5:30 PM] .Lily#8358
yes, you get paid your balance once per hour as long as its higher than 1ERG


[08/26/2021 5:30 PM] Lupus#3303
Okay


[08/26/2021 5:32 PM] Lupus#3303

[08/26/2021 5:40 PM] Ananas#9063
yep, their withdrawal limit is 1 ERG, so you automatically get paid when you reach that. it's considered very low as far as USD amount goes in mining


[08/26/2021 5:42 PM] Ananas#9063
cause of transaction cost being high


[08/26/2021 5:42 PM] Ananas#9063
but on erg its nothing so its fine


[08/26/2021 5:43 PM] .Lily#8358

[08/26/2021 6:29 PM] NotSnowden#9589
Anyone know why my CPU temps are spiking while running `auto.out` on linux? It's got integrated graphics, and I thought that it might be picked up but the log says "Using 1 GPU devices" and I can see my discrete GPU temps spiking so I know it's using the actual GPU. (Possible newcomer question, I'm happy to rtfm if you can link me to the answer) Edit: also CPU is only showing around 8% usage for auto.out process.


[08/26/2021 10:42 PM] callie#3352
what happen to the mining empty block? is that true?


[08/27/2021 1:54 PM] Jeremy B#1991

if you're very lucky, you can get 140mhs


[08/27/2021 7:45 PM] geezar#8187
@apexpool they reference the 'Rev2' - FWIW Gigabyte are one of the few vendors making it really obvious, many are now using 'V1' - perhaps a ploy to coax people into thinking its the same as 'V1/V2' 3060, perhaps I need to get a new tin-hat

[08/27/2021 7:47 PM] geezar#8187
So the 'Rev.1.0' Giga 3060 is still nerfed (all 3060's were) but the more extreme nerf came from the 'Rev.2.0'


[08/27/2021 7:47 PM] apexpool#3878
I bought this morning online this: Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3060 Ti EAGLE OC (rev. 2.0)


[08/27/2021 7:47 PM] geezar#8187
Yep LHR


[08/27/2021 7:48 PM] geezar#8187
100%


[08/27/2021 7:48 PM] apexpool#3878
good price. I know it's LHR.


[08/27/2021 7:48 PM] apexpool#3878
I am hoping to get 130 MH/s


[08/27/2021 7:48 PM] geezar#8187
Yep - they are around the same $$$ new as non Ti's


[08/27/2021 7:48 PM] geezar#8187
agree


[08/27/2021 7:48 PM] geezar#8187
Lots of supply flooding the market 3060's everywhere


[08/27/2021 7:49 PM] apexpool#3878
I am sorry I did not buy 2, I had 10% discount on the first buy in that website...


[08/27/2021 7:49 PM] apexpool#3878
and in one hour they were gone


[08/27/2021 7:49 PM] geezar#8187
Good FPS so longer term re-sale will be higher arguably than the 60-non


[08/27/2021 7:50 PM] apexpool#3878
5% discount, but it's something


[08/27/2021 7:50 PM] apexpool#3878
588 Euro with discount.


[08/27/2021 7:51 PM] geezar#8187
Good price - sounds like your going all in on this rig... I remember when it was a 'Single gaming rig GPU...'


[08/27/2021 7:51 PM] geezar#8187
this week a 30 series rig....


[08/27/2021 7:52 PM] geezar#8187
interesting to see the stats on the power/hash with your 70ti's once you dial it all in


[08/27/2021 7:52 PM] apexpool#3878
now 679 Euro on another website the same card (the website where my 2 3070 ti fe were bought from, a site with good prices)


[08/27/2021 7:52 PM] apexpool#3878

yeah, I hope so.


[08/27/2021 7:59 PM] apexpool#3878
is it possible that one day the LHR will be cracked and we'll see >200 MH/s from 3070 ti?


[08/27/2021 8:00 PM] apexpool#3878
maybe >250 I hope some day


[08/27/2021 8:00 PM] geezar#8187
So at the price you paid.. even with a full send V1 60 doing 126 MH/s at 110w... not a bad trade off - guess my view is with the 60ti if you accept the LHR is around the same (assuming you score one for a good price over the older/used V1 60) makes sense at least for this aglo, that said the V1 will run 49-50 MH/s on ETH so..

@andee any advice for flashing Sapphire Nitro+ 480/580 cards? They have the BIOS switch on them, I'm not sure what to look out for to not brick the cards


[08/27/2021 9:58 PM] andee#4722
keep a backup of the original, other than that not so much. try one click or copying 1500 or 1750 strap upwards


[08/27/2021 10:47 PM] Ananas#9063
does it actually have 2 bioses or is it just some marketing gimmick? Which way should the bios switch be turned on the card? or does it not matter


[08/27/2021 10:48 PM] andee#4722
if you mess up the bios flash you turn off your computer, flip the switch, boot again, then flip the switch and do a new flash


[08/27/2021 10:50 PM] andee#4722
its a feature, not a gimmick. on sapphire one bios is performance and the other is called "silence"

I have to lower the power limit I guess, the Watts from this PSU are stronger, it seems üòÇ


[08/28/2021 4:03 PM] apexpool#3878
and the rig consumes less than 400W, because the fan is not spinning. it only starts above 400W.

dropped to 126 MH/s. maybe we should have a script to change work intensity on the fly to fool the graphics card. change memory clock on the fly with a script.


[08/28/2021 6:41 PM] gnuion#3794
man I was so happy seeing 147 MH/s and now it dropped to almost 100MH/s.


[08/28/2021 6:42 PM] Tapas#6754
LHR kicking in i guess


[08/28/2021 6:45 PM] gnuion#3794
Maybe let some Machine Learning find a way to trick the GPU... there must be something we can do. I don't know the point of LHR. Even gamers can mine to compensate for the leveraged price... They wanted to have two product lines for more profitability I guess.


[08/28/2021 6:45 PM] andee#4722
the point of it is to sell more CMP cards


[08/28/2021 6:46 PM] gnuion#3794
yes, having diverse products so now you have to have two GPUs one for mining and one for gaming.


[08/28/2021 6:49 PM] andee#4722
its to avoid mining gpu's flooding the market and taking away sales from the next generation they launch


[08/28/2021 6:50 PM] andee#4722
it was never about the gamers, that's just marketing


[08/28/2021 7:00 PM] Jack#3324
I think this is the sweet spot, memory, core oc doesnt do much

[08/28/2021 10:24 PM] apexpool#3878
I have to limit one at 135W and the other at 137W, otherwise the hashrate drops

176 is a good place to be man, the damn watts however... LHR-Tax... (+30w) feels like over the old 3070 lol

@apexpool remember score a wall meter


[08/28/2021 10:27 PM] geezar#8187
ton of them around - varying degrees of quality.. seen some blown out so maybe not use it long term, for testing I run the mobo, monitor things then add a GPU 1 at a time to get the true usage

I will buy one, good idea


[08/28/2021 10:29 PM] geezar#8187
For example - Nvidia mostly* represent the true usage, older AMD GPU's do not - for example RX470 will show me 50w... but in reality its actually 95w 'at the wall'


[08/28/2021 10:29 PM] geezar#8187
Mobo+CPU etc.. get her up and running and establish your' base usage


[08/28/2021 10:29 PM] geezar#8187
then add 1 GPU at a time and dial things in - only way to really know


[08/28/2021 10:30 PM] geezar#8187
For me I run 80% max duty on the PSU for safety - some push it further some even less

[08/28/2021 10:31 PM] geezar#8187
worth it bro 100% @apexpool no way of knowing other than praying the miner/drivers telling you the truth - that said in Windows you can do much more analysis on true consumption


[08/28/2021 10:31 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, 800W is probably the maximum you want, there's also a graph on the manual, the efficiency drops after some point

@apexpool also you prob know but avoid molex/sata for the risers man - I have (a lot) and not had issues but recommended to run the 6 pin - some GPU's can suck a hell of a lot of juice out the riser...

As soon someone mentions wallet connects and üí© , Let them go


[08/29/2021 8:12 AM] apexpool#3878
block them


[08/29/2021 8:12 AM] iamneo#3112
Try the above OC settings and see the result you get


[08/29/2021 8:13 AM] iamneo#3112
Hope it helps, hope someone can share better specs for us on 3060 LHR and TI LHR

im switching to trex hold up


[08/29/2021 8:14 AM] apexpool#3878
I have the best results with t-rex so far on 3070 ti fe


[08/29/2021 8:14 AM] iamneo#3112
Yeah... But 3070 is another boat... Wish I could get one


[08/29/2021 8:16 AM] apexpool#3878
yes, but it's Nvidia and it's LHR.


[08/29/2021 8:16 AM] apexpool#3878
it works best with core locked as parameter to t-rex.


[08/29/2021 8:16 AM] SmoothBrain#9726
which one should i copy?


[08/29/2021 8:16 AM] SmoothBrain#9726
0 0 125


[08/29/2021 8:17 AM] SmoothBrain#9726
or 1400 2145 120


[08/29/2021 8:17 AM] iamneo#3112

why?


[08/29/2021 8:26 AM] iamneo#3112
The spec I gave you are for ERGO have no idea about ETH


[08/29/2021 8:26 AM] SmoothBrain#9726
i use nanopool for eth for ages


[08/29/2021 8:26 AM] SmoothBrain#9726
its running ergo


[08/29/2021 8:26 AM] andee#4722
because nanopool has been over 50% of the nethash for a long time, and are still at +40%


[08/29/2021 8:26 AM] SmoothBrain#9726
it just says eth because i was mining it before


[08/29/2021 8:27 AM] apexpool#3878
it is too large and it is a threat to the network, having such a large slice of the hashing power.


[08/29/2021 8:27 AM] SmoothBrain#9726
ah alright.


[08/29/2021 8:27 AM] SmoothBrain#9726

so pretty bad for a 3060ti. okay by 50 core or 10 watts?


[08/29/2021 8:28 AM] iamneo#3112
I get so better values....


[08/29/2021 8:29 AM] iamneo#3112
135 mh


[08/29/2021 8:29 AM] SmoothBrain#9726
did both on both cards.


[08/29/2021 8:30 AM] apexpool#3878
limit the power to 107W

[08/29/2021 8:30 AM] SmoothBrain#9726
i changed one to 110 and the other to 1450

i will lower the power level to 1070 and lower the core to 1350

honestly, once i get my 3080s LHR tomorrow, i might just sell these :\

but i will try it again


[08/29/2021 9:05 AM] iamneo#3112
Put everything stock and go from there. First all zeros, and see what you find on watts usage. Second, keep lowering core values in -100, +100 values and see what you can get the most in MH. Third, the same with mem clock. When you fine tune it to a value you like, block pl and save. This will take you at least a couple of hours. No other way, when template values are not working for us. That's how I found my values... Each GPU acts differently....


[08/29/2021 9:10 AM] SmoothBrain#9726
am i modifying the mem and the core at the same time?


[08/29/2021 9:10 AM] SmoothBrain#9726
im pretty sure the work together so i can just lower one and when i get the hash,  play with the other


[08/29/2021 9:13 AM] SmoothBrain#9726

pull power to that rig and the other rigs comes online, wifi works again etc


[08/29/2021 9:56 AM] gnuion#3794
do you have them connected to the same power source, the router and rig?

Node* and yes mining enabled


[08/29/2021 11:58 AM] andee#4722
this could cause intermittent problems like this? its so strange that it only happens after a gpu crashes and takes the rig down. but it is a "smart" switch down there... so wouldn't surprise me that's the culprit


[08/29/2021 12:01 PM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
Yes, all packets on the LAN are broadcast out from the switch.  GPU crashing could be causing broadcast storm.

seems like the script I wrote to try to fix this automatically has been removed from cron, damn hiveos

Linux needs minimum 460.84 - earliest supported driver and the one I used to crack 119.4 MH/s - V2 LHR - not sure about Hive as not a user but that for sure works, 460.39 - will fail to load/cause problems

Follow along in this video to get a node going on your local network, followed by a stratum server, then mine to it! Avoid pool fees and help to further decentralize Ergo. This was all done on a fresh install of windows 10 pro that was fully updated.

[08/29/2021 4:53 PM] geezar#8187
All relative - people with a few 100 MH/s have scored blocks within hours solo... some with 10 GH/s have waited 10 days... the rewards are compelling...


[08/29/2021 4:53 PM] gnuion#3794
is it possible to solve part of the block and get rewarded instead of the full block? that way even small miners could earn? just a stupid theory of mine heheh

Pool is more regular 100% and some argue without a ton of hash no point solo... but it does and can yield great results

Google ergo stratum server and just get that runnin, its easier than getting the node going. then it will connect.


[08/29/2021 8:03 PM] newtoetn#3388
Sorry to sound like a broken record, but I am still trying to figure out this Node-Stratum server stuff.  The video was great but  for some reason I am having an issue with the DIFF and miner.  So I am trying TREX and NB and with Port 3056 the diff defaults to the network diff of 3.8PH which is way too high for my test rig of 150MH - no shares subbed and it times out after awhile.  Port 3032 VARDIFF code ends up lowering the diff so low that it floods the server and the BANNED code kicks in to stop the miner.  Anything come to mind as to what could be off?  As a side note-Wooly Solo has worked out well with 2 blocks in a month which is around the same as pool mining according to the calc, but trying the node route is just something that sounded intriguing.


[08/29/2021 8:19 PM] andee#4722
try raising minimum diff


[08/29/2021 8:19 PM] andee#4722
and to be honest, there is no point in having low diff shares when you are solo mining


[08/29/2021 8:19 PM] andee#4722
mine at netdiff, if you get a share you found a block


[08/29/2021 8:47 PM] newtoetn#3388
Thanks, I'll have to revisit that option.   So with Solo mining, it would be better to set a static or min diff to some higher value than vardiff would yield since it's not about the number of shares submitted, but getting lucky with a correct share.


[08/29/2021 8:54 PM] andee#4722
share count only matter when you pool mine for showing you statistics and calculating your payment


[08/29/2021 8:55 PM] andee#4722
if you solo mine at netdiff a share equals a block. so if you see a share on your miner you know you found a block

@trex are you mining eth as devfee? because the miner seems to be crashing consistently every 3-4 hours. and my clocks are too high for eth


[08/30/2021 6:54 AM] trex#6765
no, it's mining the same algo as the user, and for ERG it's ERG


[08/30/2021 6:55 AM] trex#6765
The miner usually tells you which GPU caused the crash. If it's the same GPU most of the times, trying dialing the clocks down.


[08/30/2021 9:01 AM] geezar#8187
LHR is hard to get your head around... I had the same testing V2 60 non ti - sweet spot (power wise) got me 88w for 107 MH/s


[08/30/2021 9:07 AM] geezar#8187
@trex The 30 series generally defaults to intensity 24 - have you done B2B testing on the different intensities on your miner?  (next on my list) damn LHR sweet spot is hard to dial in as each GPU differs, just curious as that would be another test tweak to try with the clocks and under-volt. swear I will never get this time back testing LHR cards..... üò¶


[08/30/2021 9:10 AM] trex#6765
Testing it as we speak actually. It seems reducing intensity helps against LHR at a cost of lower hashrate.


[08/30/2021 9:10 AM] geezar#8187
Was thinking same - running 24, will post up if I find anything too üëç  the variance between locked core by as little as <5 or >5 is nuts too


[08/30/2021 9:15 AM] trex#6765
Thanks.
I've got a 3060 (not sure which revision) and it's doing 104.5Mh in stock. As soon as I set mem clock to anything greater than zero, the limiter kicks in. However, if I run the miner with `-i 18` it lets me set mem clock to as high as +600 and get 111Mh as a result, for example.


[08/30/2021 9:17 AM] geezar#8187
Nice result - makes total sense too, if you can check the GPU in windows you will know if it's a V1 or V2

2504 = 'V2' or 'More nerfed' as opposed to 'V1' - normal nerf - the V1's will work with 460.39 ofc - minimum for V2 is 460.84


[08/30/2021 9:19 AM] geezar#8187
The intensity setting could be a game changer for 3060ti LHR GPU's - anyone tested? (lower intensity)


[08/30/2021 9:20 AM] trex#6765
Mine is 2503, must be V1 then?


[08/30/2021 9:20 AM] geezar#8187
yep - should work with 460.39 and run 49-50 MH/s on ETH no problem too


[08/30/2021 9:20 AM] geezar#8187

[08/30/2021 9:52 AM] apexpool#3878
I would be a nice feature to change --lock-cclock value without restarting t-rex. 
this seems to work better that setting the core clock externally (in hiveos), but restarting the miner every time stops me from doing as many tests as I wish, to find the ideal value.


[08/30/2021 9:57 AM] andee#4722
@apexpool run the miner without it and try different values using nvidia-smi. then when you find the value use it to run the miner


[08/30/2021 9:58 AM] geezar#8187
Tell you guys - nuts - running no offset and seeing much better results on the 70ti... no massive gains but with no offset and just using locked core lower power and more consistent results

270 is impressive - post your findings on the pinned community hash google sheet üëç the drops are common on LHR


[08/30/2021 10:00 AM] geezar#8187
the sweet spot generally is the point that does not happen - max hash for 20 mins or so is fine, but consistent hash is a different story


[08/30/2021 10:00 AM] BloodyTwin#3170
Ok. But are the drops something that fixes itself or something that I have to constantly restart


[08/30/2021 10:01 AM] geezar#8187

are you limiting the power? when this happens to my 3070 ti cards, the solution is to limit the power a little more, and then it is very stable.

Everytime it‚Äôs dropped to 180 so far it automatically goes back to 268-270 without further input

I moved it down to 1375. Seems to drop less often but will automatically go back up to speed when it does. 1400-1425 gives me 271 or above

287 for me, but idk how to undervolt or I could get it down to 220 according to some forums


[08/30/2021 10:08 AM] geezar#8187
Locked core is a good way to drop the power and remain high hash rates - T-Rex does this in miner

[08/30/2021 4:17 PM] andee#4722
I have no expertise in this, but I think you want the stratum server. unless you are running the open source miner

Yes agreed i need the Stratum server but it won‚Äôt talk to the node here on the same machine.  I can talk to herominers if i set -s to it. Just can‚Äôt talk to my own node

I like these, with some of the content about the plug in meters burning out recently. TBH I only use when setting up new clocks and configuring - position on a desk close to the rig and monitor changes to the wall power -  those are sweet however. Always meant to find out where BBT got his from his Test Rig TBH but never looked into it

@glasgowm as above - a lot of threads on this, not really a dupe of #node as its specifically related to solo mining - @BuzzLiteBeer and a few others have created some great supporting content too - another Channel OK?


[08/30/2021 5:40 PM] apexpool#3878
no more --lock-ccore on command line for t-rex, just intensity 20 (instead of 24 as it was before).


[08/30/2021 5:40 PM] apexpool#3878
still experimenting


[08/30/2021 5:41 PM] apexpool#3878
I crashed the rig earlier with too high memory clock


[08/30/2021 5:41 PM] geezar#8187
damn.... see your pushing to 3300 and holding well - 140w...... I'm not even close... 1550/2900/150 for 174 MH/s.... intensity 24


[08/30/2021 5:41 PM] apexpool#3878
it also worked with 3500, it crashed with 3550


[08/30/2021 5:42 PM] geezar#8187
TBH Not seen any real gains other than extra heat pushing the mem maybe 0.5 MH/s per increment of 100 or so but your settings are very good


[08/30/2021 5:42 PM] apexpool#3878
I'll try to decrease them, too, once I see how much it can go


[08/30/2021 5:42 PM] apexpool#3878
the second card now cannot do more than 141W, hashrate drops.


[08/30/2021 5:43 PM] geezar#8187
strange thing is when I tested 2000-2300 range LHR kicked in - the irony at much higher clocks was more stable


[08/30/2021 5:44 PM] apexpool#3878
also 2900, 3100 and 3200 are good values, but I only tested with -400, -500 and -502 cclock with good results.


[08/30/2021 5:44 PM] geezar#8187
never tried as low as -i 20.. interesting guess the hunch was right - could be a win for LHR, wish I had a 60ti to test that theory out on too (dropping from 24 to sub 20 etc)


[08/30/2021 5:44 PM] apexpool#3878
now I'm setting cclock at the 1770, which is the OC in specs


[08/30/2021 5:44 PM] geezar#8187
I've stopped using offset now completely just locked core... the search continues


[08/30/2021 5:45 PM] apexpool#3878
@trex suggested lower intensity and higher mem clock, he must know something üôÇ


[08/30/2021 5:45 PM] geezar#8187
for sure, -i 18 - worth a shot will keep checking in until we hit the stable 180 Range üòÑ


[08/30/2021 5:46 PM] apexpool#3878
I'll still experiment and post the results, in case they are better.


[08/30/2021 5:46 PM] geezar#8187
Annoying with only one GPU - easier with a few to test out and reduce test times assuming they are producing similar results


[08/30/2021 5:46 PM] apexpool#3878
now it stays constantly over 178 no both cards.

159W


[08/30/2021 5:54 PM] geezar#8187
what actual core are you setting? 1770 but not locked right?


[08/30/2021 5:55 PM] apexpool#3878
it is absolute value, when you go over a certain value it is not relative anymore, it is absolute (in hiveos)


[08/30/2021 5:55 PM] apexpool#3878
so I guess it is locked, but not as parameter to t-rex.


[08/30/2021 5:55 PM] apexpool#3878
and t-rex does not display it, like nbminer.


[08/30/2021 5:56 PM] apexpool#3878

but... 159w.... kill me...


[08/30/2021 6:02 PM] apexpool#3878

good price, same for 3060 non ti

is it possible I bricked my non-lhr 3080 by overclocking to 1800 MHZ memory in msi afterburner? started it on nbminer eth, it crashed and since then it's been code 43-ing, 100% not driver issue. it's less than 2 weeks old, so not sure if it was just a matter of time, i really dont think this would brick a card, ever


[09/01/2021 8:21 AM] geezar#8187
Never yet bricked any GPU by OC - had a few fail and need to be RMA'd but not at any extreme clocks - usual rules apply if on Windows DDU the driver, re-install and run the GPU stock settings and determine, you'll know quickly if using any of the outputs into a monitor if working, usually the image on the screen shows signs/blue bars and random characters


[09/01/2021 8:22 AM] geezar#8187
I use Linux but as a good way to test DDU (sharing in case anyone not used it) - cleans all the reg entries and cleans things up before re-installing. On AMD rigs in Windows used to do this almost weekly with some miners..

A simple test rig is always handy, even running a USB bootable OS to run (mobo+psu - basic setup just to test GPU's) I've seen RMA after a week but also after 2 years) mostly never had any issues from OC - BIOS modding, possibly not OC


[09/01/2021 8:32 AM] Ananas#9063
I did a bunch of DDU, with internet disconnected, on two different windows setups, on my main PC the motherboard is unable to boot when the GPU is inserted through either PCIE 16x or on a riser. On the mining rig it just shows code 43 in device manager, did a bunch of DDU there as well, device manager has no issues with 3070 ti, 1060, amd cards, just the 3080.

[09/01/2021 8:35 AM] Ananas#9063
but yea I didn't do any sketchy shit to it, it was mining erg on +1800 mhz memory for a week at 200 watts, then it became non-functional when I started it on eth with 230 watts, 0 core, +1800 mhz - meanwhile everything was the same, same riser same cables etc

which makes 0 sense because it was happy mining at 230 watts, 0 core, 1500 mhz eth at 102 mh, doubt this additional 300mhz OC would fuck it up, I guess it was a matter of time

why are you flashing it doe


[09/01/2021 5:19 PM] andee#4722
@Ananas how is the card messed up?


[09/01/2021 5:20 PM] geezar#8187
I'm really not sure this is going to end well..  üôè


[09/01/2021 5:20 PM] Ananas#9063
Ah andee the flashing god is here i should wait a min


[09/01/2021 5:20 PM] Ananas#9063

could try the oven if this fails


[09/01/2021 5:21 PM] Ananas#9063
I turned off mining ergo with it, turned on eth miner


[09/01/2021 5:21 PM] geezar#8187
bios on the mobo?


[09/01/2021 5:21 PM] geezar#8187
tried the GPU on a different board?


[09/01/2021 5:21 PM] Ananas#9063
PC crashes, when it reboots all cards are recognized, the 3080 too but it has a code 43 error


[09/01/2021 5:22 PM] Ananas#9063
Tried DDU a bunch, etc


[09/01/2021 5:22 PM] Ananas#9063
Did 6 hours of troubleshooting


[09/01/2021 5:22 PM] Ananas#9063
Nothing


[09/01/2021 5:22 PM] geezar#8187
How about a simple DOS boot drive


[09/01/2021 5:22 PM] andee#4722
I have never messed with nvidia bioses


[09/01/2021 5:22 PM] geezar#8187
establish if the card can be seen in DOS no OS

did you check dmesg output in hiveos


[09/01/2021 5:23 PM] Ananas#9063
Idk what that is


[09/01/2021 5:23 PM] geezar#8187
460.91 should be OK but its still an early driver


[09/01/2021 5:23 PM] andee#4722
did it work in hiveos before that? if not tested before, update driver


[09/01/2021 5:23 PM] geezar#8187
480.84 was minimum for the V2 60


[09/01/2021 5:23 PM] Ananas#9063
Ok ill try these before flashing


[09/01/2021 5:23 PM] Herk#6019
ssh into that hiveos box, type "dmesg"


[09/01/2021 5:24 PM] Herk#6019
paste output somewhere and link it or check for errors


[09/01/2021 5:24 PM] Ananas#9063
Give me 2 min im doing the piss ive been holding back for 2 hours cause of this card


[09/01/2021 5:25 PM] miner29#2975
make sure you have the slot the 3080 in is set to Gen3...seeing lots of reports of error 43 being gen4 or auto slots....cant hurt to try


[09/01/2021 5:25 PM] Herk#6019
is it on a riser


[09/01/2021 5:25 PM] Herk#6019
?


[09/01/2021 5:25 PM] geezar#8187
All support 3080 but is it a LHR one?

it's not LHR


[09/01/2021 5:25 PM] geezar#8187
agree @miner29 bios on the mobo possibly - can you not try it on another mobo?


[09/01/2021 5:25 PM] Ananas#9063
it does 102 mh on ETH


[09/01/2021 5:25 PM] Ananas#9063
i tried on both a riser and directly in the mobo


[09/01/2021 5:26 PM] Herk#6019
same port?


[09/01/2021 5:26 PM] geezar#8187
ah so only on ERG there is a problem?


[09/01/2021 5:26 PM] Ananas#9063
no


[09/01/2021 5:26 PM] geezar#8187
ETH it mines ok?


[09/01/2021 5:26 PM] Herk#6019
so it's not the mobo


[09/01/2021 5:26 PM] Ananas#9063
@Herk no @geezar no


[09/01/2021 5:26 PM] Herk#6019
doubt it mines at all


[09/01/2021 5:26 PM] Ananas#9063
me too


[09/01/2021 5:26 PM] Herk#6019
it's not initialized at all


[09/01/2021 5:26 PM] andee#4722
cross your fingers and do a bios flash üôÇ


[09/01/2021 5:26 PM] Ananas#9063
it gives code 43 on both windows mobos i tried


[09/01/2021 5:26 PM] geezar#8187
If it was me - would be botting into a USB bootable OS


[09/01/2021 5:26 PM] Herk#6019
doubt you can even flash a bios on it


[09/01/2021 5:26 PM] geezar#8187
pre bios flashing


[09/01/2021 5:26 PM] geezar#8187
on a different mobo


[09/01/2021 5:27 PM] Ananas#9063
i can @Herk i just made a backup of the current bios with nvflash


[09/01/2021 5:27 PM] Ananas#9063
it sees it


[09/01/2021 5:27 PM] Herk#6019
hmm interesting


[09/01/2021 5:27 PM] geezar#8187
even something like the old Hirens boot (many much newer but easy to boot and DL)

i can do that


[09/01/2021 5:27 PM] geezar#8187
Take the OS out of the equation


[09/01/2021 5:27 PM] andee#4722
as long as its made for that device id its no problem to flash greens. its just impossible to edit them and flash since it has to be signed by nvidia


[09/01/2021 5:27 PM] Herk#6019
in hiveos, dmesg, you should see if the driver complains about anything


[09/01/2021 5:28 PM] Ananas#9063
ok ill do hiveos dmesg right now


[09/01/2021 5:28 PM] geezar#8187
in DOS for some AMD GPU's I can only 'see' them and recovered that way but in this instance maybe it can be seen* so not as bad

Gen 3, but not on main 16x


[09/01/2021 5:32 PM] Ananas#9063
Ill try now on main 16x


[09/01/2021 5:32 PM] geezar#8187
I would remove and try on a different mobo + make sure that mobo is up to date with the mobo bios from the vendor


[09/01/2021 5:32 PM] geezar#8187
afk good luck !!!


[09/01/2021 5:32 PM] Ananas#9063
Will do that too, cheers!


[09/01/2021 5:34 PM] andee#4722
have you tried the card in a x16 slot? no riser


[09/01/2021 5:36 PM] Ananas#9063
Doing that now, will go through all the things u guys just suggested even if im up till midnight haha


[09/01/2021 5:36 PM] Ananas#9063

[09/01/2021 8:11 PM] bbot#6878
hopefully you have warranty on it


[09/01/2021 8:11 PM] Ananas#9063
i do, its less than 2 weeks old


[09/01/2021 8:11 PM] bbot#6878

[09/01/2021 8:11 PM] Ananas#9063

inno3d 4 fan edition

been sticking with EVGA, fe's, msi and asus and have had pretty good luck so far


[09/01/2021 8:34 PM] bbot#6878

[09/01/2021 8:34 PM] bbot#6878
and i have 16 3070's from all the brands above without issue and have been mining 24/7


[09/01/2021 8:48 PM] geezar#8187
sorry to hear that - even after the BIOS flash - refund the way to go then


[09/01/2021 8:49 PM] geezar#8187
I had to RMA a 1660s after 2 weeks once, some GPU's die, some keep going for years - sure nothing you actually did @Ananas good luck with the RMA


[09/01/2021 9:04 PM] Ananas#9063
Yea p sure it was close to DOA in this case. It ran with perfect wiring, good riser, and 200 watts on ergo on less than 50c. On eth it was never above 96 mem junc. So ye, just shit card unfortunately. Luckily theres an EU law that says if ur electronic device died within 6 months of purchasing it, it qualifies as a DOA and ur entitled to a refund or a replacement


[09/01/2021 9:05 PM] Ananas#9063
So not even warranty is needed fortunately


[09/01/2021 9:06 PM] Ananas#9063
Although while i was looking up flashing nvidias, i noticed ppl are flashing asus rog 3080 bioses onto their other brand 3080 for an mh/s improvement


[09/01/2021 9:06 PM] Ananas#9063
Ppl were reporting 5-10 mh increase :o


[09/01/2021 11:15 PM] geezar#8187
Flashing an old Polaris I'm good with but that takes some big balls to flash the 3080 üôÇ


[09/01/2021 11:16 PM] geezar#8187
Principle the same as the 1660s now pushing 35-35 MH/s on ETH but would rather brick a 1660 than a 3080 üôÇ


[09/01/2021 11:20 PM] Herk#6019
it‚Äôs not such a big deal but could be frustrating and not sure if warranty is still a thing if you flash say a different brand‚Äôs bios

[09/01/2021 11:23 PM] Herk#6019
latest nbminer should detect when lhr kicks in apparently


[09/01/2021 11:23 PM] Herk#6019
I run them at 1500/2400


[09/01/2021 11:23 PM] geezar#8187
Depends if RMA process check the BIOS on the now bricked GPU.. all a gamble but could pay off it you see 5-10 MH/s perhaps


[09/01/2021 11:23 PM] Herk#6019
very stable, no issues with them


[09/01/2021 11:23 PM] geezar#8187
similar cranked mem as high as 3400 on them locked core 1500 works well

with trex, with the previous nbminer they‚Äôd be +10W per card extra


[09/01/2021 11:27 PM] geezar#8187

Also high usage cpu by service host: diagnostic policy service and system interupt


[09/02/2021 12:33 AM] andee#4722
have you tried updating the driver?


[09/02/2021 12:34 AM] acadian.eth#2222
yes tried uninstall and reinstall, will try the DDU


[09/02/2021 12:35 AM] acadian.eth#2222
not sure what this process is though


[09/02/2021 12:37 AM] andee#4722
which of them? nvidia-smi is for monitoring and managing gpu's


[09/02/2021 12:37 AM] acadian.eth#2222
yes that too, not sure why that is being shutdown


[09/02/2021 12:37 AM] acadian.eth#2222
this all started when I pushed the mem clock too high, it shutdown and then booted to blackscreen


[09/02/2021 12:37 AM] acadian.eth#2222
so will try DUU maybe corrupt driver


[09/02/2021 12:38 AM] acadian.eth#2222

You can combine on  any Nvidia together, as long as the drivers are supported for the GPU.


[09/02/2021 4:17 AM] pbr713#9954
@robotü§ñarmpitsüí™ thanks man. I got it. I didn‚Äôt realize I need to make a change in afterburner to see the other one

All is well

I don‚Äôt have a 3070 but I have a 3070ti which I run at 174w. 135w seems low. Have you tried increasing it?


[09/02/2021 7:03 AM] acadian.eth#2222
It's not a power issue, I am back on windows now


[09/02/2021 7:03 AM] acadian.eth#2222
If I have one card plugged in I can get 169 mhs no problem


[09/02/2021 7:04 AM] acadian.eth#2222
If I plug in the second, windows throws high CPU usage through system interrupts and diagnostic process


[09/02/2021 7:05 AM] acadian.eth#2222
This is regardless of clock


[09/02/2021 9:08 AM] geezar#8187
My power is bad on this GPU - 145w up to 155w way too much IMO

[09/02/2021 2:19 PM] miner29#2975
Depending on miner you may need to disable cpu check of shares.  Should reduce cpu load.  Usually done through command line argument on miner‚Ä¶but i dont use hive but i do use linux.


[09/02/2021 2:28 PM] John RealFi_lm#4322
Hi Guys,
I have the possibilities to get three of them, each 670‚Ç¨. anybody experience that cards from msi?
MSI GeForce RTX 3060Ti Ventus 2X OCV1 LHR 8GB GDDR6

Thanks üôÇ


[09/02/2021 2:44 PM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
With my experience on a EVGA 3060ti LHR, you would have to run a youtube video.  Supposedly a low resolution vlc could work, and also a script to left click dragging the mouse.  I hit 130-138m/h avg


[09/02/2021 2:56 PM] John RealFi_lm#4322
130-138m/h is not to bad. Thanks buddy

I am setting it in overclocking to 1770, which is the OC max, and I have the best results, but it shows what you see in my screenshot: 1575 for the first card (1575 is the max clock without OC) and 1545 for the second

What settings you use for that?  I'm at 171 mh at 155W but I'm running my cards a little conservatively. I've got it locked at 850mV which for mine puts it at 1605MHz on the coor. And just +800 on the memory (in Afterburner in windows, so equivalent would be +1600 in HiveOS)


[09/02/2021 8:33 PM] apexpool#3878
compared to 179 MHz 141w it is not good, too.


[09/02/2021 8:34 PM] apexpool#3878

Depends on goals, I run 120-125 at the wall or 79w-87w reported - only 150 MH/s but run cool


[09/03/2021 8:19 AM] geezar#8187
Key is lowering the mv - stability comes usually around 750mv or lower for around 140 MH/s - max hash 200 MH/s will report a lot higher, depends on how you want to set them up - the TRM guide is a great place to start IMO - some on here have gone 200 MH/s + consistently at very high core (1500) the downside is high power + heat

personally I never run more than 80% of the max for the PSU - having blown 3 PSU's from inexperience in the past tend to stick to that rule now


[09/03/2021 1:29 PM] acadian.eth#2222
ever use three+ psus on one rig? how many times can you safely split the 24 pin lol


[09/03/2021 1:50 PM] CryptoMinerOS#1745
I believe you can use as many as you like as it is just switching on the PSUs. I am using like add2psu.com on my own rigs or you can just manually short the pins to start the PSUs.


[09/03/2021 2:02 PM] miner29#2975
I have a couple of triple psu rigs.  Using a W power cable adapter.  Only one psu is powering the mobo & 24pin.  The other two are only being switched on in sync through the 24pin W plug.  So 1 mobo does a couple of cards & risers and all mobo.  The pther two do only card/riser sets.  3 - 750w psus all loaded around 50% have worked great for last 4 years.


[09/03/2021 2:03 PM] miner29#2975
nice thing about using a Y or W cable for 24pin is single psu turnon point‚Ä¶.works well with a smartplug to remote power cycle rig. üòâ


[09/03/2021 2:08 PM] andee#4722
@miner29 are you saying that you connect all atx supply rails together?


[09/03/2021 2:09 PM] geezar#8187
I've picked up some mining mobo's that directly attach the 24 pin the the board or come supplied with the 24 pin splitter allowing 2 or more to be connected


[09/03/2021 2:09 PM] geezar#8187
Sure the AS Rock came with such a cable


[09/03/2021 2:09 PM] andee#4722
I have a couple mobo's that has 3 atx connectors to, but I doubt that anything else than ground and ps_on is connected from con0 to 1-2


[09/03/2021 2:12 PM] andee#4722
connecting voltage rails of 3 switch mode power supplies together is not something I would gamble on


[09/03/2021 2:12 PM] geezar#8187
Correction Asus - only have one of these, nice GUI at post indicating health of the risers

[09/03/2021 2:13 PM] andee#4722
but they are not wired in parallel, that's my point. connecting 3.3,5,12v from three power supplies together is not the way to go


[09/03/2021 2:14 PM] andee#4722
for the same reason as you don't power the riser from one psu and the gpu from another


[09/03/2021 2:14 PM] geezar#8187
sure some of the boards from Gigabyte comes with these too

if you look closely, the upper connector is wired just like I said. two wires. GND + PS_ON

I run the 'btc miner' generic chinese PSU's now, never missed a beat - 1800w-2400w range, not the most efficient but bullet proof so far


[09/03/2021 2:17 PM] geezar#8187
so seldom run dual or triple PSU's


[09/03/2021 2:17 PM] geezar#8187
server PSU's are tempting but the noise... not sure may revisit


[09/03/2021 2:17 PM] gnuion#3794
best I got with 3060ti lhr is 137MH/s using the docs sheet:

if I were aiming for +10TH it wouldn't matter, server psu's ftw


[09/03/2021 2:20 PM] andee#4722
102W is pretty sweet


[09/03/2021 2:32 PM] geezar#8187
Yep - Cosrairs from 550 up to 1200 I've used and retain many but bang for buck the generic china PSUs have been bullet proof (if a little noisy) üôÇ


[09/03/2021 2:32 PM] geezar#8187
damn thats nice.... is that not the best we've seen yet for efficiency/hash?


[09/03/2021 2:34 PM] andee#4722
what price are those?


[09/03/2021 2:37 PM] geezar#8187
Picked them up for around $30 - the mining Mobo's were around the same some time back - same are now circa $140 for the PSU, still low price and alarmingly good for what they are


[09/03/2021 2:38 PM] geezar#8187
Would recomend sticking to known premium brands however as only a matter of time before....

[09/03/2021 2:42 PM] andee#4722
thanks, will check it out. if I get started on a new rig I can put this cheapo on my 4gb rig and move the evga and corsair psu to the new rig


[09/03/2021 2:52 PM] geezar#8187
totally, that 60ti... 102w for 137 MH/s must put that right up to the top of the efficiency scale or close?


[09/03/2021 2:53 PM] geezar#8187
keep us posted on how you get on - assume 99w-100w will not hold that hash?


[09/03/2021 2:54 PM] geezar#8187
have you messed with the -intensity settings on T-Rex also?


[09/03/2021 2:54 PM] andee#4722
pretty far up there, the non lhr may be a bit better. but this is just from random numbers I have in my untrustworthy head üòÜ


[09/03/2021 2:55 PM] geezar#8187
even a throttled back Vega... non ti V1 60 will do 99w 123 MH/s or so V2 - 119 again at 99w damn impressive


[09/03/2021 2:57 PM] geezar#8187
Lots of them around and available too


[09/03/2021 3:00 PM] andee#4722
most efficient I see is a 3060ti at 156MH@108W


[09/03/2021 3:01 PM] andee#4722
not the most efficient, most efficient of that card


[09/03/2021 3:01 PM] andee#4722

its in the spreadsheet, but its probably an early version 3060ti


[09/03/2021 5:26 PM] gnuion#3794
hello geezar, yes it is very efficient, but electricity here is only $0.07  so I'd love to see more hashrate... no I didn't try that fancy stuff... maybe I will...


[09/03/2021 5:26 PM] gnuion#3794
okay, I thought it was for LHR


[09/03/2021 5:28 PM] andee#4722
I will try all the tricks I can think of next week when I get mine, do you have a routine when clocking? core first, memory, then power limit? or is it a mix?

[09/03/2021 5:29 PM] andee#4722
my goto on normal cards has been maximize memory, reduce core, then limit power/undervolt. but seems like that may not work well on these cards


[09/03/2021 5:29 PM] gnuion#3794
Not really, I just wrangle the numbers no Idea what I am doing. The spreadsheet helped me the most...


[09/03/2021 5:30 PM] arokace#8057
That's OCing for you, get an idea of what the goal should be then fiddle with b the numbers and learn.  :P


[09/03/2021 5:30 PM] apexpool#3878
not working for me... same card I assume.


[09/03/2021 5:31 PM] gnuion#3794
mine is 3060ti LHR 2.0. it should work... using nanominer but should work with others also...


[09/03/2021 5:32 PM] andee#4722
the problem with offsets is that it depends on the baseclock


[09/03/2021 5:32 PM] andee#4722
so -500 on two different models may be different

did you set the powerlimit to 102?


[09/03/2021 5:36 PM] apexpool#3878
but I am very happy with 135 at 100w


[09/03/2021 5:36 PM] apexpool#3878
100 first


[09/03/2021 5:37 PM] apexpool#3878
then increased to 110w


[09/03/2021 5:37 PM] apexpool#3878
and hashrate increased with 1 MH/s


[09/03/2021 5:37 PM] apexpool#3878
so not good


[09/03/2021 5:37 PM] apexpool#3878
trying now 102w


[09/03/2021 5:39 PM] apexpool#3878
do you have exactly the same card? or it is not Eagle OC?


[09/03/2021 5:40 PM] apexpool#3878
it doesn't like 102, 100 is much better.


[09/03/2021 5:40 PM] apexpool#3878
102 -> 85 MH/s, 100 -> 136 MH/s now.

and I payed 588 Euro


[09/03/2021 5:42 PM] gnuion#3794
i think with 136 you are good. 1 or 2 MH/s don't matter. let me know if you crack 140MH/s on LHR please!


[09/03/2021 5:42 PM] gnuion#3794
I paid 750 Euros


[09/03/2021 5:42 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, sure, but I think 135-136 is the best I can hope


[09/03/2021 5:43 PM] gnuion#3794
However, I need it anyways for 3Drendering and stuff... so not  a bad deal. I could sell it for profit, because now it's trending at  850Euros...


[09/03/2021 5:45 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, I see many of them on ebay at 750 Euro or more


[09/03/2021 5:45 PM] apexpool#3878

its insanely energy efficient, but not sure if the extra price is worth the extra efficiency compared to the 3060 v2


[09/03/2021 6:18 PM] geezar#8187
tend to agree I list out increments of OC clocks and move up/down step at a time on a notepad, including intensity for T-Rex - only way to really dial in the GPU


[09/03/2021 6:18 PM] gnuion#3794
you can get great efficiency with 3060ti LHR but they are too expensive now...


[09/03/2021 6:19 PM] apexpool#3878

it increased from an unstable 80-95 to 135


[09/03/2021 6:19 PM] geezar#8187
You nailed it with 99w for 119 - depends if you can score the 60ti cheap enough, the 60ti will hold its value more longer term (arguably)

How do I find the best value


[09/03/2021 6:20 PM] Ananas#9063
the greatest downfall of the 3060 v2 is that you cant run it on linux at the best efficiency


[09/03/2021 6:20 PM] Ananas#9063
the linux driver cant do 99 watt


[09/03/2021 6:20 PM] Ananas#9063
just 100


[09/03/2021 6:20 PM] apexpool#3878
best values for me are 1770 of -550


[09/03/2021 6:20 PM] Ananas#9063
and at 100 watts LHR activates and ur hash is fked


[09/03/2021 6:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Gotcha


[09/03/2021 6:20 PM] apexpool#3878
but with 1770 it doesn't work anymore after adding the 3060 ti


[09/03/2021 6:20 PM] gnuion#3794
I dont care at that point.


[09/03/2021 6:21 PM] apexpool#3878
100w is the minimum value you can set for power for 3060 ti


[09/03/2021 6:21 PM] apexpool#3878
between 100w and 220w I think


[09/03/2021 6:22 PM] Ananas#9063
the issue I'm saying is that the v2 is bad on linux, you need windows


[09/03/2021 6:22 PM] Ananas#9063
otherwise it's not that efficient


[09/03/2021 6:22 PM] Ananas#9063
you need 15 more watts


[09/03/2021 6:22 PM] Ananas#9063
on linux


[09/03/2021 6:22 PM] Ananas#9063
to reach 119


[09/03/2021 6:23 PM] gnuion#3794
what about those windows backgound processes that drain a lot of power? and how is 138@102  not efficient?


[09/03/2021 6:23 PM] Ananas#9063

im talking about 3060

[09/03/2021 6:29 PM] apexpool#3878
for the first 2 cards 3070 ti about 65-70 Euro per month.


[09/03/2021 6:29 PM] apexpool#3878
now 100w extra with the 3060 ti


[09/03/2021 6:29 PM] gnuion#3794
maybe it can make sense to install some used solar panels for the day. electricity is cheaper during the night I think...


[09/03/2021 6:29 PM] apexpool#3878
so another 22 Euro/month


[09/03/2021 6:31 PM] apexpool#3878
but hoping to get >$400/month at the current conditions (difficulty, ergo price)


[09/03/2021 6:31 PM] apexpool#3878
or close to $400


[09/03/2021 6:32 PM] gnuion#3794
I think that after RVN halving and ETH 2.0 mines will target ERG more and more.


[09/03/2021 6:33 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, but hopefully the price will also increase then.


[09/03/2021 6:33 PM] gnuion#3794
That means a smaller piece of the cake for everyone, however ERG will also increase in value by then, because of the increased difficulty.


[09/03/2021 6:35 PM] apexpool#3878
if it is not worth mining, they will leave.


[09/03/2021 6:35 PM] gnuion#3794
Sometimes it's just more worth buying the crypto and holding if you can afford it...  I wish I'd bought ERG at $4 instead of investing in mining equipment... either way, at least I can heat my apartment in the winter for free!


[09/03/2021 6:37 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, heating in the winter is an advantage. I have to find the coldest room for the rig, I guess üôÇ

do you need to open the GPUs and renew the thermal paste?

I need it for my rx470


[09/03/2021 6:45 PM] gnuion#3794
it's getting too hot 70 degrees at 70W


[09/03/2021 6:45 PM] geezar#8187
used old GPU's like Polaris if they have not been done... years of gaming/mining will be impacting their performance for sure


[09/03/2021 6:46 PM] geezar#8187
RX470 love them - still 110w at the wall (47 reported) love them for what they are tho


[09/03/2021 6:46 PM] apexpool#3878
I cleaned the PS4 Slim 2 weeks ago... BIG difference now.


[09/03/2021 6:47 PM] geezar#8187
See the PS5 content about the reduced size cooler...


[09/03/2021 6:47 PM] geezar#8187
caught the vid before it went viral lol


[09/03/2021 6:47 PM] gnuion#3794
Same cards, same settings the one is getting hotter. I used a not so great thermal paste on that so I will try artic next...

The New PS5 is Worse üò¨
The Sony PS5 has already been updated...or should I say downgraded.
Subscribe to @PSReady! https://www.youtube.com/c/PSReady/
I put Windows on an Xbox Series X: https://youtu.be/Fuq8MWpq6KI

For reference the updated PS5 model number is CFI-1100B 01 which is for the PS5 Digital Edition compared to the launch PlayStation 5 Digital model CFI-1015B...

all this talk about cooling... check that if you wanna see how the big guys do it


[09/03/2021 6:48 PM] apexpool#3878
I switched the position of my 3070 ti cards today, to be sure they are performing identical. they do. the cooler one is cooler and has better hashrate because it is the first one, no warm air from another card on it.


[09/03/2021 6:49 PM] apexpool#3878

for the V1 versions


[09/03/2021 6:51 PM] gnuion#3794
The value of W/mK matters. I used a thermal paste with only 1.8W/mK. Artic has 5.6W/mK and grizzly has 12.5 W/mK


[09/03/2021 6:51 PM] deezick#3187

and no one is gonna use those cards for gaming anymore


[09/03/2021 6:53 PM] deezick#3187

great man. happy you made good profit


[09/03/2021 6:54 PM] apexpool#3878
can you fix them? or only if they have 2 bioses?


[09/03/2021 6:54 PM] deezick#3187
great thing about 570 or 580 is that you could unbrick by shorting pins 1 and 8 on one of the chips lol


[09/03/2021 6:55 PM] deezick#3187

I mostly used mining to pay for food and rent when I was in university


[09/03/2021 6:58 PM] apexpool#3878

I might make a 3070ti rig

because I got a computer engineering degree

that's a good choice, I would say.


[09/03/2021 6:59 PM] deezick#3187

[09/03/2021 6:59 PM] deezick#3187
if I can get it under 6 then it might be worth it

Isn't it constantly doing read and write cycles?


[09/03/2021 7:03 PM] gnuion#3794
IPFS is for storage


[09/03/2021 7:03 PM] apexpool#3878
the blockchain should stay as small as possible.


[09/03/2021 7:03 PM] deezick#3187
memory has a limited number of R/W cycles that it can handle before you get bit corruption and degredation


[09/03/2021 7:04 PM] apexpool#3878
SSDs too, especially the RIs


[09/03/2021 7:04 PM] gnuion#3794
on ram it doesn't matter. only the encryption and file generation takes a lot of IO cycles. I still have to learn more... ERG is my favorite PoW crypto though....

MSI RX Vega 56 Air Boost thermal pad thickness.
Hello,

A friend of mine bought an MSI RX Vega 56 Air Boost. The seller said that the thermal paste was replaced but once the GPU reaches 80 Celsius it shuts down the PC.
So I opened it and to my horror instead of puting thermal pads on the mosfets and inductors the seller used thermal paste...

I was not sure a celeron will be good enough for more cards, that's why I payed 35 Euro extra for the i3. now I am glad, because I can also mine Monero with it, the celeron would have not worked so well...

Yep - 4GB and Celeron dual core 13 GPU rig, no issues


[09/03/2021 7:55 PM] Ananas#9063
@geezar you think 3080 LHR for $1200 is a good price?


[09/03/2021 7:55 PM] apexpool#3878
what can you configure about it? it's a linux


[09/03/2021 7:56 PM] andee#4722

[09/03/2021 7:56 PM] apexpool#3878

[09/03/2021 7:56 PM] geezar#8187

[09/03/2021 7:57 PM] Ananas#9063
@geezar cause of the shortage or what? lately i noticed all stores all sold out of every gpu here. the mining gold rush started again


[09/03/2021 7:58 PM] andee#4722
ryzen's get really sucky with slow ram though


[09/03/2021 7:58 PM] apexpool#3878
16 GB on that one, too.


[09/03/2021 7:58 PM] apexpool#3878
and my laptop (where I am now) is also a Ryzen 5 with 16 GB RAM. but I did not try mining on it.


[09/03/2021 7:58 PM] geezar#8187
Seen some content recently suggesting the reduced production and knock on impact post covid... suggesting even at current prices demand will continue to outstrip capability of the factories.. so that super x2 MSRP card could be worth a lot more in 6-12 months time


[09/03/2021 7:58 PM] apexpool#3878
I should try, to see the difference on Monero.


[09/03/2021 7:59 PM] andee#4722
what matters is the speed of the ram, I run 3600 on my desktop


[09/03/2021 7:59 PM] geezar#8187
always found CPU mining dialing in the cores in use/threads - on the older CPU coins the difference was huge, that said the older miners did not auto configure the threads in use - usually -t 4 etc


[09/03/2021 7:59 PM] apexpool#3878
mine has only 2166 I think, the mainboard is cheap.


[09/03/2021 7:59 PM] andee#4722
any ryzen at 2166 will suffer performance wise


[09/03/2021 8:00 PM] geezar#8187
remember to use the wall meter some new CPU's use a lot more power than you think


[09/03/2021 8:01 PM] geezar#8187
if mining 24/7


[09/03/2021 8:01 PM] geezar#8187
+ your total GPU power at the wall


[09/03/2021 8:01 PM] gnuion#3794
is 3200 a good speed?


[09/03/2021 8:01 PM] geezar#8187
all cores/threads working flat out will heat it up too, good cooling is a must for CPU mining


[09/03/2021 8:02 PM] andee#4722
especially if its intel inside üòÖ


[09/03/2021 8:03 PM] andee#4722
if its a newer gen ryzen I would say that is the minimum recommended for proper performance ( depending on workload also ofc)

40w less without mining Monero.


[09/03/2021 8:14 PM] apexpool#3878
I started doing it because the Hashrate for Ergo increased while mining also Monero.


[09/03/2021 8:15 PM] apexpool#3878
now it is the same. I think I will stop mining Monero.

Samsung are a hassle but even on a 470 will do 65 MH/s 1150/1950/881mv and run REF 30 as @andee suggests - I have actually run higher REF for a small lift

it's also a chinese 470 ming card, no fan

and based on your wattage, they might not be running at what you set them at

Anyone got a fix to this? My rig it‚Äôs running an atx psu for the pc and a server psu for the GPU. When i turn on the atx psu (atx psu connected to server psu btw) the server psu spins fans really loud  then shutoff then stops, then spins fans really loud then shutoff then stops again, then spins fans and finally boots up.


[09/04/2021 12:23 AM] Al_NFT | oak.bet#9014
The example from GitHub shows that you may only need one lock-cclock:

Example: --lock-cclock 1000,1300,0 (applies clock 1000Mhz to GPU #0, 1300MHz to GPU #1, ignore GPU #2) not sure if same applies to mclock

don't forget 1000W is always peak. I read on some PSU 1000W peak and 300W operating üòÇ

I am getting less reward in herominers as compared to nanopool nanominer anyone having this issue


[09/04/2021 8:46 AM] andee#4722
PROP vs PPLNS. its also not possible to compare properly without mining at several pools at a time


[09/04/2021 8:46 AM] andee#4722
but please change to another pool than nano


[09/04/2021 9:08 AM] Peeved#0730
Try woolypooly maybe? it's PPLNS like nano


[09/04/2021 9:31 AM] chad NIETZSCHE#0912
Ok now I will change to woolypooly bro

I have a 3080 ti and while mining it's temps are 65¬∞C on core temp and 90¬∞C on memory is this temps are safe for my card


[09/04/2021 2:11 PM] apexpool#3878
I would increase the fan speed to 60% to see what happens with the temperatures.


[09/04/2021 2:11 PM] chad NIETZSCHE#0912
I am running fans at 95%


[09/04/2021 2:12 PM] chad NIETZSCHE#0912
So should I change fan speed to 60% @apexpool

no.

my cards are running much cooler with 60% fan speed, but they are 3070 ti

and 80% for a 3060 ti for 56c (but a 3070 ti blows warm ait to the 3060 ti)


[09/04/2021 2:14 PM] chad NIETZSCHE#0912
I have read many articles on 3080 ti temps all of them say while gaming card touch 73-75¬∞C

True, but if a PSU goes faulty it can send out a spark or smth

it would need to be glowing red of heat, a spark wont ignite anything

The 1-4 pcie splitters work in any system but there may be other limitations imposed to a specific mobo.  No drivers are needed for it regardless of system as it works with the pcie bus directly.  Best to get your system up and running first with the gpus then add the 1-4 in an x1 or better slot (only uses x1 but works with any pcie slot).  Add a gpu at a time and boot and run. Most. ive gotten to run was 3 in a single system (3 slot board) for 12 gpus.


[09/05/2021 2:19 PM] miner29#2975
i agree as well that using a server psu and breakout board for the gpus would be better than that suspect unknown psu brand.

[09/05/2021 4:11 PM] miner29#2975
You can get kits that you use a regular ATX to power motherboard and a few gpus then add their kitted server psu and have tons of pcie 6+2 or you can get the all in 1 units that have all the motherboard connections plus lots of PCIE 6+2.  They also sell micro psus for the mother board that can be used then with a server psu / breakout with just pcie 6+2.


[09/05/2021 4:11 PM] gnuion#3794
Okay, thank you, wish I had known this stuff before. I always had issues with power supplies...


[09/05/2021 4:12 PM] miner29#2975
The important rule is this...a gpu must be powered both at the riser and gpu connections by the SAME psu.  So if using atx + server...if the card is in a physical mobo slot then it MUST be powered by PSU that is powering motherboard.  If you are using risers then the gpu and the riser need to get power from same PSU...(never mix psus to riser/gpu)

@geezar 36 mh/s on flashed hynix memory


[09/05/2021 6:07 PM] Ananas#9063
ill keep tuning it a bit, but thats insane.


[09/05/2021 6:07 PM] Ananas#9063
it was 31 before.

36.1 was unstable, now it settled on 35.7 at 93 watts.


[09/05/2021 6:22 PM] Ananas#9063
3-4 mh/s increase with the flash


[09/05/2021 6:41 PM] morbes#6686
Is there anywhere to calculate taxes for mined ERG?


[09/05/2021 6:42 PM] gnuion#3794
what taxes?


[09/05/2021 6:42 PM] morbes#6686
It's taxable income in the US


[09/05/2021 6:43 PM] gnuion#3794
No it's not, you are not earning legal tender money... only if you sell ERG you have to report. And if you hold ERG for more than one year you pay long term capital gain which is less and can be 0%.


[09/05/2021 6:44 PM] Ananas#9063
or u can just pay with crypto when ur shopping


[09/05/2021 6:44 PM] morbes#6686
crypto miners have to pay taxes on the fair market value of the mined coins at the time of receipt. Mined cryptocurrency is taxed as income, with rates that vary between 10% - 37%. The IRS classifies mining income as self-employment income, and taxpayers may be responsible for self-employment taxes on mined income.


[09/05/2021 6:44 PM] Ananas#9063
and return the items unopened, and the shop will give the refund to you via bank transfer


[09/05/2021 6:45 PM] gnuion#3794
If I hated you, I could pump a coin and send it to you. After you pay taxes, I'd dump it.


[09/05/2021 6:46 PM] morbes#6686
Well its in the IRS tax laws so you might want to relook at it if you're mining in the US. Staked crypto is taxed too.


[09/05/2021 6:47 PM] gnuion#3794
Move out of U.S. Come to Europe!


[09/05/2021 6:47 PM] geezar#8187
damn man so it worked! nice !


[09/05/2021 6:48 PM] Ananas#9063
yeah, although the consumption is a bit higher than I'd like, but i think its just an unlucky card. at the lowest afterburner setting it did 83 watts


[09/05/2021 6:48 PM] geezar#8187
RMA'd my Hynix so was unable to test - nice result

[09/05/2021 6:49 PM] geezar#8187
agree - sure Samsung was 71w-75w for 32 MH/s sometimes 2400 mem would produce 33.2 (ETH - what you seeing on ERG man?


[09/05/2021 6:49 PM] Ananas#9063
so basically a 4 mh/s increase along with 8 watt increase, very nice.


[09/05/2021 6:49 PM] Ananas#9063
let me test


[09/05/2021 6:49 PM] Ananas#9063
u got settings for it with the modded bios?


[09/05/2021 6:49 PM] geezar#8187
Hynix used to be the 'one you did not want' lol - with that flash now the one to look out for - you still need to use negative mem on that right?


[09/05/2021 6:49 PM] Ananas#9063
nope


[09/05/2021 6:49 PM] geezar#8187
so instead of +2000 - something like -1800 ?


[09/05/2021 6:49 PM] Ananas#9063

64 was what I see on Samsung - fire her up on ERG - sub 75w would be win-win

i honestly might refund the guy lmao


[09/05/2021 6:52 PM] Ananas#9063
if this card does well on ERG then its a good one


[09/05/2021 6:52 PM] Ananas#9063
problem was with 1660s it sucks on erg raven, most other coins apart from ETH, despite having a great 6 gig memory


[09/05/2021 6:53 PM] Ananas#9063
sucks as in compared to its price


[09/05/2021 6:53 PM] Ananas#9063
70 mh at 85 watts


[09/05/2021 6:53 PM] Ananas#9063
ERG


[09/05/2021 6:54 PM] gnuion#3794
not bad, similar to my rx470


[09/05/2021 6:55 PM] Ananas#9063
i dont like it.. i can buy 3 gig 1060 for 1/3 of the price and that does 55-60 mh


[09/05/2021 6:55 PM] Ananas#9063
or even a 1060 6gb costs 60% less, and does 55-60 mh with same 6gb mining lifespan


[09/05/2021 6:56 PM] Ananas#9063
ill try to tweak for higher core clock


[09/05/2021 6:58 PM] geezar#8187
This is true... the 3GB I tested P106 will run 55 MH/s - trade off really 70 MH/s is a 'full send' Polaris GPU basically at less power, the 470s generally use less so.... for me the 1660s is a great GPU and never had issues


[09/05/2021 6:59 PM] geezar#8187
sure it has more in her @Ananas mess with core - will need more than your ETH clocks prob


[09/05/2021 6:59 PM] Ananas#9063
the guy i sold it to paid $600

[09/05/2021 7:00 PM] gnuion#3794
I think over time you need more ram for ERG also... DAG file size increases...


[09/05/2021 7:00 PM] Ananas#9063
yea but u can mine with 3gb until 2023 summer.. and the 1060 3 gigs im buying ROI in 5 months


[09/05/2021 7:04 PM] geezar#8187
1660s residuals are strong - $600 for one... damn.... are they going for that much now!!


[09/05/2021 7:07 PM] Ananas#9063
yep, but i think only in my country

if LHR need min 460.84


[09/05/2021 7:23 PM] geezar#8187
if non 460.39 way to go -200/2600/100-110 PL all day long


[09/05/2021 7:23 PM] WeeklyOptions#5401
its LHR i assume


[09/05/2021 7:24 PM] WeeklyOptions#5401
says nvidia driver - N460.91.03


[09/05/2021 7:25 PM] geezar#8187
that will work - check pinned @Ananas found a sweet spot for sure - sometimes you need to hard reboot the rig if the clocks did not take - try lower than max settings initially and keep the PL a touch higher just to test her


[09/05/2021 7:25 PM] Ananas#9063
it wont work on hive


[09/05/2021 7:26 PM] Ananas#9063
linux drivers arent able to do 99 watts, only windows drivers


[09/05/2021 7:26 PM] Ananas#9063
if u have multiple 3060 v2s i'd set up a rig for them, or put them all on ur main pc

[09/05/2021 8:03 PM] fay#5512
Hi. Wanna ask which card is doing best for ergo in term of efficiency between these:
- 3060ti LHR
- 3070 LHR
- 3070ti LHR


[09/05/2021 8:07 PM] apexpool#3878
3070ti -> 1.29 MH/W
3060ti -> 1.37 MH/W


[09/05/2021 8:09 PM] geezar#8187
@apexpool 147w 1530 locked btw... nothing close to 141w yet but progress


[09/05/2021 8:09 PM] geezar#8187
-i 20 as we suspected


[09/05/2021 8:09 PM] apexpool#3878
for me more than 140w is bad.


[09/05/2021 8:10 PM] apexpool#3878
this is my PL


[09/05/2021 8:10 PM] apexpool#3878
-i 20


[09/05/2021 8:10 PM] geezar#8187
rare - most are running higher but will continue to test


[09/05/2021 8:10 PM] apexpool#3878
how much should I do on ETH or ETC?


[09/05/2021 8:11 PM] apexpool#3878
I tried ETC for 20 minutes and I did 45-46 MH/s with 3070ti and 33-34 MH/s with 3060 ti


[09/05/2021 8:11 PM] geezar#8187
ETH is pumping but LHR will be a disadvantage big time with LHR


[09/05/2021 8:12 PM] fay#5512
Thanks. What about 3060 LHR? From GPU Monkey I see the hashrate is higher than those two

[09/05/2021 8:12 PM] geezar#8187
Polaris RX580 full send at 2300 mem will run 34-35 MH/s (sill high power) but 32-33 all day long and a much cheaper option


[09/05/2021 8:12 PM] geezar#8187
would not use the LHR on ETH unless something like an 80ti for 80 MH/s + - that said ETH is pumping so..


[09/05/2021 8:12 PM] apexpool#3878
right now

140w... man thats nice


[09/05/2021 8:14 PM] apexpool#3878
combining absolute with offset is not working well, it seems


[09/05/2021 8:15 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, it seems very efficient


[09/05/2021 8:15 PM] apexpool#3878
fortunately the 3060 ti is working with 100w, it is the minimum I can set in hiveos.


[09/05/2021 8:15 PM] apexpool#3878
and 101 is already too much, LHR kicks in and drops to 80-90


[09/05/2021 8:17 PM] apexpool#3878
I can also set memory 3500, but when starting sometimes it is too high. but there is no significant difference between 3400 and 3500.

would anyone have idea why my hashrate on teamredminer is only about 15mh? on SRBMiner i have about 132MH, and wanted to switch over to teamred for more hashes instead of significantly less

i'm using Vega56 with latest drivers, mining to herominers pool. i'm really new to mining and haven't fiddled with any settings, just trying things out on my normal PC


[09/06/2021 7:44 AM] DA#5185
anyone experience trex miner hashrate drops?


[09/06/2021 7:44 AM] DA#5185
my 3070 ti keeps dropping from 180mhs down to 110-130mhs all of a sudden


[09/06/2021 7:45 AM] DA#5185
and i have to just set the oc settings back even tho nothing changed for it to go back to 180 mhs. but sometimes i just need to turn on my monitor and it would be enough to get 180mhs back


[09/06/2021 7:53 AM] apexpool#3878
what is you power limit? it works for me with 140w power limit without dropping.

on windows it worked the best for me with core locked at 1500


[09/06/2021 8:07 AM] apexpool#3878
you can also lock memclock on windows, on hiveos it's not possible.


[09/06/2021 8:07 AM] apexpool#3878
it is different.

from gigashite/asus/msi only one msi card likes those settings and sits around 175-176mhs

~~is gigabyte bad?~~

Over the years ive had more issues with msi then gigabyte, is why im aksin


[09/06/2021 10:37 AM] apexpool#3878
probably not so easy to find the best settings.


[09/06/2021 10:37 AM] Herk#6019
there's various things you can do to make sure your setup is safe(r?)


[09/06/2021 10:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
Ahhh tbf, the 3060 settings that are pinned worked splendidly with some alterations here and there


[09/06/2021 10:38 AM] Herk#6019
proper cables, risers, good quality psus, insurance and automatic fire extinguishers

Alright then thr only thing i truely should add is a better quality psu

a bit all over the place


[09/06/2021 10:51 AM] Herk#6019
that last card doesn't like it at all.. but was running at 150W before with 1500/2400


[09/06/2021 10:54 AM] Herk#6019
that asus needs a new riser but for now -550/1400 ... wish they'd all run like that üòÑ


[09/06/2021 11:52 AM] geezar#8187
@Herk now we know where all the 70ti's went lol - testing atm as it happens too - still find locked 1500-1530 sweet spot but no where near 180


[09/06/2021 11:56 AM] Herk#6019
:KEKW:


[09/06/2021 11:56 AM] Herk#6019
increasing power slowly but it's definitely not stable


[09/06/2021 11:56 AM] Herk#6019
I prefer -550/1400 for 170 lol


[09/06/2021 11:59 AM] geezar#8187
184 at a crazy 170w lol


[09/06/2021 11:59 AM] geezar#8187
170 seems to be the norm/achievable


[09/06/2021 11:59 AM] Herk#6019
10-15mhs for another 30w.. not for me


[09/06/2021 12:00 PM] geezar#8187
exactly


[09/06/2021 12:08 PM] andee#4722
probably depends on where you live, as long as temp is still fine I'd do 15MH for 30W. almost $10 profit a month for me


[09/06/2021 12:09 PM] geezar#8187
true - looking at an old 1080ti - will hold 100 MH/s at 130w but 115-120 MHs at 140w - when I consider running a polaris for 65 MH/s for 100w all relative


[09/06/2021 12:10 PM] andee#4722
for me $10 extra profit a month pays over 5% of the electricity for my 1GH


[09/06/2021 12:10 PM] Herk#6019
30w per card.. is a lot


[09/06/2021 12:10 PM] Herk#6019
I'd rather put another card in


[09/06/2021 12:12 PM] geezar#8187
remember the 30 series is super efficient, all relative each miner has different needs/tolerances for power


[09/06/2021 12:14 PM] andee#4722
$10 extra per card each month is also quite a bit üôÇ great for you if you have good access to cards, but that is not the reality for a lot of us


[09/06/2021 12:15 PM] Herk#6019
it is, if it's easy to fix electrics and stuff then it still pays off I guess


[09/06/2021 12:16 PM] andee#4722
if I pushed $10 extra a month when I started mining erg, that $10 would be worth $50 now üôÇ


[09/06/2021 12:16 PM] Herk#6019
when you're limited to just a few kW and can get cards it's a bit different, at least in my case


[09/06/2021 12:17 PM] Herk#6019
but overall you're right, still a profit even at $0.25/kwh

i saw ppl putting balls above the rig


[09/06/2021 4:05 PM] Ananas#9063
what i would do is get one of the balls, put it above the rig. and also get a wifi smoke alarm. that way the alarm will go off sooner than the ball


[09/06/2021 4:06 PM] Ananas#9063
you make hiveos turn off the rig if the alarm goes off, so even if water is used as an extinguisher inside the ball, the rig is sfae

ill try to tune mine v2s tomorrow, cheers!


[09/06/2021 9:18 PM] Deathmumi#1369
have fun, there is small spot point you need to catch it try 1100mhz on core first then raise it slowly where it drops hashes


[09/06/2021 9:18 PM] Deathmumi#1369
at least you will 115mhs easily


[09/06/2021 9:18 PM] Deathmumi#1369
power may between 90-110w


[09/06/2021 9:19 PM] Deathmumi#1369
best performs samsung mem cards


[09/06/2021 9:23 PM] Ananas#9063
i found 1300 core to be the spot where it's the highest before LHR kicks in


[09/06/2021 9:23 PM] Deathmumi#1369
yeah generally 1300 max point


[09/06/2021 9:23 PM] Ananas#9063
can you undervolt on hiveos?


[09/06/2021 9:23 PM] Deathmumi#1369

i' m using win

my best is 121mh at 99 watts on windows


[09/06/2021 9:24 PM] Ananas#9063
v2


[09/06/2021 9:25 PM] Deathmumi#1369
yes it can be windows always have good option about oc/driver options


[09/06/2021 9:26 PM] Ananas#9063
especially cause linux driver cant do 99 watt PL, only 100 watt


[09/06/2021 9:26 PM] Ananas#9063
which is terrible cause 100 w kicks in LHR, 99 doesnt


[09/06/2021 9:26 PM] Deathmumi#1369
yes linux uses inbuild power conditions


[09/06/2021 9:51 PM] apexpool#3878
I'm lucky, for me 100w is good, 101w LHR kocks in (Gigabyte 3060 ti Eagle OC V2)

Does anyone know why Hiveos overclocking is double in windows? Like how 500 memory clock in windows is 1000 on hiveos, any reason besides for more specific numbers?


[09/07/2021 4:11 AM] Sojun#9092
you end up at the same overclock. i think windows just expects the double-data rate


[09/07/2021 4:12 AM] Sojun#9092
while linux doesnt. you still end up at the same 10000mhz memory clock or w/e for ddr6x


[09/07/2021 4:12 AM] Sojun#9092
linux isnt faster.


[09/07/2021 4:12 AM] Sojun#9092
often a bit slower, often a bit more power and almost always less tools to diagnose.

I might buy a 3080 FE in a few days... I don't know the price yet, waiting for the seller to receive the card and decide üòÇ 
how much should I pay for it, he sold me a 3070 TI FE with 800 Euro.


[09/07/2021 8:55 PM] apexpool#3878
(maximum price that I should pay)


[09/07/2021 11:35 PM] Ananas#9063
u paid great money for that 3070 ti


[09/07/2021 11:41 PM] apexpool#3878
great as in good price or expensive?


[09/07/2021 11:42 PM] apexpool#3878
I believe it's a good price, seeing what people ask on ebay for them.


[09/07/2021 11:58 PM] Ananas#9063
good price


[09/08/2021 12:34 AM] danandbeard#2312
yeah, that's well below ebay prices - which means it's always a good buy - cards fly off the shelf at ebay prices

looking for help, I talked to someone here few days ago about a  RAIJINTEK MORPHEUS cooler for my pain in ass Vega. Which one is it that I get? Online reddit ppl just say RAIJINTEK MORPHEUS II, but they have a core edition and a superior High-End VGA Cooler.  If anyone has experiance with these much appreciated in advance for suggestion.


[09/08/2021 1:25 AM] Canberry#7404
the morpheus ii is a VGA cooler


[09/08/2021 1:25 AM] Canberry#7404
core edition is just black


[09/08/2021 1:25 AM] Canberry#7404
they have a vega version that, afaik, is the same rebranded


[09/08/2021 1:33 AM] Pharotek#2932
yea the Vega one I cannot find anywhere. I've found a few threads that just say morpheus ll, .... not what version


[09/08/2021 1:34 AM] Canberry#7404
theyre all the same


[09/08/2021 1:34 AM] Pharotek#2932
wondering if the core edition or superior will work


[09/08/2021 1:34 AM] Pharotek#2932

ok, I was not 100% sure if this is what you meant. I'm curious how much he will ask for the 3080 FE.

`Firmware image updated.

So basically the Zotac Twin-Edge OC (V1 3060) was flashed with the same BIOS (albeit from TechPowerUp) and MH/s in line with the others - well worth flashing


[09/08/2021 10:45 AM] geezar#8187
The problem was ANY clocks would run 2-3 MH/s lower than same model, flashing the BIOS (care to be taken) with the same model on this occasion worked, no need to force flash - if anyone has same problem could be worth it but DYOR


[09/08/2021 10:45 AM] geezar#8187

I don't see many or any on sheet, anyone use rx 460 4gb cards for ergo yet? Have option to get 3 for 100$ a pop


[09/08/2021 3:07 PM] Canberry#7404
I feel like any GPU nowadays at $100 is a steal


[09/08/2021 3:07 PM] Canberry#7404
but I haven‚Äôt used a 460 before so idk


[09/08/2021 3:11 PM] Canberry#7404
well after looking around, people with 560s on here seem to do 30-35MH


[09/08/2021 3:11 PM] Canberry#7404
so you‚Äôd do like 90-105MH at $300


[09/08/2021 3:34 PM] Pharotek#2932
Thats goodbway to look at it! Thanks for looking!


[09/08/2021 3:44 PM] andee#4722
any theory about how that could happen? I have tripped one of my breakers many times when the capacitors in the psu has been drained after shutdown. never had any hardware problems because of it ü§î


[09/08/2021 4:19 PM] Pharotek#2932
Was the psu meant for 220v or 110v? A lot of 1200w + psu require 220v


[09/08/2021 4:28 PM] geezar#8187
Agree with this - hell even the RX550's (30 MH/s or so) are expensive now... nuts


[09/08/2021 4:28 PM] andee#4722
even broken ones go for +$100 here üòÜ


[09/08/2021 4:29 PM] geezar#8187
@andee its insane.... the price for 'parts vegas' used to be $100-200 - now its more than the original working prices!


[09/08/2021 4:29 PM] andee#4722
"non functional rx580, no led when turning on, fans not spinning" $200 please


[09/08/2021 4:29 PM] geezar#8187
in fact I've seen many 'parts' GPU's for more than the average selling prices 6 months ago!

[09/08/2021 5:45 PM] andee#4722
I like nb's reporting of mutl and clocks, but it lacked faster reporting of stats so I ended up with trex


[09/08/2021 5:45 PM] andee#4722
doesn't really matter when finished tuning though


[09/08/2021 5:45 PM] geezar#8187

lolminer I've had a lot of success with, number of shares submitted too - need to do 24 hours on each with same conclusions but combo of them all I test with which is a total hassle


[09/08/2021 5:46 PM] andee#4722
its something that should be added, I like seeing those stats. some of my crashes when close to 8k mem clock was because the gpu somehow decided to boost clock +200


[09/08/2021 5:47 PM] geezar#8187
Get a notepad - increment the -intensity on T-Rex too - try as low as -16 up to -25

plus the usual clocks... time consuming af.. lol

47c and stable here


[09/08/2021 7:28 PM] apexpool#3878
if the temperature is lower, the card is more efficient and I should decrease the power limit, otherwise LHR kicks in. but 100w is the minimum power limit.


[09/08/2021 7:28 PM] apexpool#3878
so I have to decrease the fan speed to increase the temperature.


[09/08/2021 7:29 PM] apexpool#3878
at least this is how it happens and this is my explanation why it happens like this.


[09/08/2021 9:12 PM] gnuion#3794
travel in time and get non-LHR cards ü§™... consider just trading some ERG and maybe learn design software to make some NFT. You got the hardware for making cool 3Drenderings...


[09/08/2021 9:14 PM] apexpool#3878
I might buy a 3080 FE in the next days, too. that should be even better.

time travel... I would know what crypto to buy and I wouldn't need a mining rig now üòÇ


[09/08/2021 9:15 PM] gnuion#3794
In my calculation ergo could reach $1000 in 5 years. That is possible because ERG has a low cap. So consider just buying and holding some ERG because electricity is expensive in your country... However 3080FE is a good investment. It has a good hashrate and low energy consumption.


[09/08/2021 9:16 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, I am trying to accumulate ERG by mining and buying.

where in the .bat file do I include the fan options? I assume to run the fan at 100% I just set

Wonder if the negative mem trick would work on that - probably not but on the 1660s Hynix you had to run negative, maybe worth a shot


[09/08/2021 10:11 PM] andee#4722
I'll try it tomorrow, wrestling a 580 trying to get it mining eth right now

Annoying, I run 1215/2250/875-900 on ETH pretty high but the Microns hold 33.5 (34-35 with 1300/2300 lol but silly power and heat

[09/08/2021 11:27 PM] Salu#0001
Guys, I'm a gamer and I mine about 12 hours a day, what pool should I use? For most consistent revenue, cause I've heard that by turning off my miner I actually lose revenue on my 12 hours mined


[09/08/2021 11:27 PM] Salu#0001
Currently switched to leaf from hero cause of pool latency,


[09/08/2021 11:44 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Pps pools are probably best for you


[09/08/2021 11:45 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389

[09/08/2021 11:45 PM] Salu#0001
ergo doesnt have any pps pools does it?


[09/08/2021 11:45 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
There is one in china


[09/08/2021 11:46 PM] Salu#0001
fuck...im in NA the latency would murder my stale rate, also i dont know how to read mandarin


[09/08/2021 11:46 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
I would try ravencoin. They have a lot of pools and some do pps


[09/08/2021 11:47 PM] Salu#0001
nah i love ergo


[09/08/2021 11:47 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
The benefit of pps over pplns is that you dont wait hours for the pool to get your hashrate


[09/08/2021 11:47 PM] Salu#0001
partially due to the fact that its kind on gpu temps


[09/08/2021 11:53 PM] Salu#0001
eh whatever ill just settle for 2 miners, i like the ui more anyways


[09/08/2021 11:53 PM] SnowPea#7485
Why not go for nicehash?


[09/08/2021 11:53 PM] Salu#0001
never used them, i like trex


[09/08/2021 11:56 PM] SnowPea#7485
I used nicehash for about a month, income was pretty stable, then i switched to erg cuz i want to actually mine the coin


[09/08/2021 11:58 PM] Salu#0001
nice


[09/09/2021 12:00 AM] SnowPea#7485
Been mining ergo for a bit over a week and getting my 3rd coin in a few hours. If you are selling for immediate profit, i recommend doing nicehash as they pay you in btc and you can make more than mining ergo


[09/09/2021 12:04 AM] Shadolance#8254
What's your setup?


[09/09/2021 12:04 AM] SnowPea#7485

[09/09/2021 12:13 AM] SnowPea#7485
Im using nbminer and i noticed something interesting a few days ago. I used to set my fan to auto, and its always on 3x%, with that setting, my mem clock could never get pass +900


[09/09/2021 12:15 AM] SnowPea#7485
Then one day i set the fan on manual and set it to 75%, and i was able to get to +1050 (not very stable tho), so now i went back to +950 and its been very stable with ~126mh/s


[09/09/2021 12:15 AM] SnowPea#7485
I also underclocked my core to -400


[09/09/2021 12:23 AM] Shadolance#8254
okay so maybe underclock my core by a little, then try boosting my memory clock further? Maybe 800?


[09/09/2021 12:24 AM] SnowPea#7485
I dont have the same card, but i think you can play around, lower core and up the fan, once its stable then try upping the mem and lower the power

Anyone have a 3080 ti that keeps spiking core clock, even with afterburner on?


[09/09/2021 5:39 AM] MikeyMike87#9350
Fellow gamer here. I'm on a PPLNS pool and leave my miner running even when gaming. I will sightly lower the OC (15%) and depending on what game I play i go from regular 170mh/s to 60-140mh/s well gaming. Been going strong for close to 10 days now and still maintain a 24hr average of 158mh/s with roughly 4 hours of gaming each day. I only have a 3060ti (non LHR) so I cant see actual memory junction temp but GPU when mining is 49C (62C hotspot) and gaming 55C (69C hotspot). I could cool it down more but triple fans scream once I go past 70%


[09/09/2021 5:44 AM] Salu#0001
thanks for the reply, i have a 2080ti and a 2070 super, id rather not stress my psu when gaming by having my 2070Super going at the same time, i dont want to push my system past 550 with a 750watt psu, i know its safe for a short burst but i dont want to age my system since its my baby and all, as for miner pools i guess im SOL since the only PPS pool is in china and i cant read mandarin lol, so i guess ill tough it out with hero miner even tho i lose connection to them once perday, (im in canada) what really sucks is that the time i do spent mining is deprecated by not having a miner on 24/7 my 2080ti sits at 60c while mining and 75 on mem, kinda hot if you ask me, but during gaming itll touch 95 on mem and 75c on core after i deployed a ghetto fan right next to it, i just hope a PPS pool comes around soon enough


[09/09/2021 5:49 AM] MikeyMike87#9350
ahh ya that is a tad on the warmer side. I'm also in Canada. I was on hero for a while before I switched when I was doing the same thing as you. I would tough it out for until you get a bigger psu and can run full time or a english PPS pool comes around. Good luck my fellow canuck


[09/09/2021 5:55 AM] MikeyMike87#9350
Could also give www.666pool.cn a try. The website translates very well and instructions on how to connect are very clear. Plus you don't need to register for an account even though the option is there


[09/09/2021 5:57 AM] Salu#0001
cheers broski i got into erg mining cause i wanted to explore, if i wanted money id mine eth, (still bullish af) yolo im gonna try 666 pool see what happens, cheers bud buy me a timis when ergo hits 1k? üòÑ

likewise my roommate offered me 10Eth (2016) for rent payment but i said id take cash, yeah im kicking myself now hoping to undo that in ergo

i was, my experiment with 666pool was unsuccessful so i heading back to hero even tho when i game i lose rewards, man i wish there was a a gamer friendly pool


[09/09/2021 8:15 AM] geezar#8187
Power hungry but `125/800/ PL135` will give you arounf 108 MH/s with Micron mem


[09/09/2021 8:15 AM] geezar#8187
`150w will do 115-120 MH/s` from testing but a lot of power IMO, that said impressive for a 10 series


[09/09/2021 8:16 AM] geezar#8187
`125/-200/PL 135` (from the google sheet) produced 101 MH/s


[09/09/2021 8:17 AM] geezar#8187
As ever mileage may vary with some not holding these clocks or using less/more power by 10-20% the clocks need set for the specific GPU as there are no 'common' settings, using the google sheet as a guide is recomended

[09/09/2021 10:15 AM] DenAce#1197
720 blocks means 720*2minutes so 1440 minutes = 24 hours


[09/09/2021 10:41 AM] Salu#0001
Does fly pool cover the transaction fees?


[09/09/2021 10:48 AM] andee#4722
it really doesn't make for much of a difference whether they do or don't. tx fee is like 1.5 cents


[09/09/2021 10:49 AM] Salu#0001
It'll make a difference when one ergo is worth 10k and that 0.1 fee you pay is is a few hundred each day


[09/09/2021 10:49 AM] Salu#0001
But what's the transaction fee it's tiny right?


[09/09/2021 10:50 AM] andee#4722
if erg was 10k a tx would cost $10 with the current fee level


[09/09/2021 10:53 AM] geezar#8187
Much discussion over on twitter on this one - before I move to a pool always confirm basics and you own level of risk appetite/clear on payment terms - some like hero pay with 72 blocks, some take the full 720.

[09/09/2021 10:54 AM] geezar#8187
All pools make fee structure clear - simple case of DYOR + check socials or basic due dilegence IMO


[09/09/2021 10:54 AM] geezar#8187
Same as you would any purchase, using your power, time and hash power is up to the individual

My 3060ti only does 166mh with 123w, my current mem clock is at +1350, got 1 rejected in 17 hours. Rejected share goes up when i set the mem clock to 1400 or more


[09/09/2021 3:50 PM] MikeyMike87#9350
Since my last restart 10 days ago I've had 73 rejects out of 33000


[09/09/2021 3:52 PM] MikeyMike87#9350
Try dropping your power to 50-55% and see if it's still stable. And ya no need to push the mem another 50 points for a couple mh.


[09/09/2021 3:56 PM] SnowPea#7485
My hashrate drops as the power drops, PL 55% would only have 150ish mh


[09/09/2021 4:11 PM] SnowPea#7485
At PL50%, hashrate dropped to 137mh, power at 99w, mem clock +1400

[09/09/2021 4:26 PM] MylesAbove#3307
Just bought 6 3060 Ti LHR, hoping a workaround comes up in the future


[09/09/2021 4:27 PM] SnowPea#7485
Nice, lhr is still the best bang for the buck imo


[09/09/2021 4:28 PM] MylesAbove#3307
Yeah seems that way, otherwise you pay heaps for second hand non-LHR


[09/09/2021 4:28 PM] MylesAbove#3307
What pool you guys like/using?


[09/09/2021 4:28 PM] SnowPea#7485
Hero


[09/09/2021 4:30 PM] MylesAbove#3307
I suppose pool mining is still optimal if you are not a larger miner?


[09/09/2021 4:32 PM] SnowPea#7485
Im a new miner and only have 2 cards, so i think its better for me to stick with a pool with low payout rate


[09/09/2021 4:34 PM] MylesAbove#3307
My brother just bought a 4 card rig second hand, with 4 vegas!
I see vegas are great at mining ERGO


[09/09/2021 4:39 PM] SnowPea#7485
Just out if curiosity, whats the avg life span of a mining gpu?


[09/09/2021 4:42 PM] MylesAbove#3307
Not sure, prob depends on: luck, temps, OC settings, what ur mining, etc


[09/09/2021 4:42 PM] MylesAbove#3307
would want at least 2 years personally out of my gpus but honestly not sure


[09/09/2021 4:47 PM] SnowPea#7485
True, i tried not to push my cards too much and hope it'll prolong their life

Damn impressive, 3070 FE same hash does not get close 115w - you running any specific intensity settings - what miner are you using?


[09/09/2021 7:23 PM] MikeyMike87#9350
Using nbminer and not sure what intensity settings are. Just applying OC in afterburner and been tweaking the power lower and lower to get the best efficiency. I float in-between 1.54 - 1.62 hash/watt


[09/09/2021 7:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
Instead of rejected shares i get "illegal memory usage" or something alike when putting memory higher then 1400 on my 3060 is this a normal warning? I knoe rejected shares happen but i havent seen this one before


[09/09/2021 7:45 PM] andee#4722
that happens when clock is too high


[09/09/2021 7:54 PM] SnowPea#7485
Did you set up virtual memory? That could be a reason too


[09/09/2021 7:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
Clock works finr when memory is beloe the 1400


[09/09/2021 8:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hmm I think i did yea, will check it out tomorrow


[09/09/2021 8:01 PM] andee#4722
2300 works for me, 2350 is instant crash


[09/09/2021 8:07 PM] Cody#9591
anyone know why my vegas would crash after its loading autolykos table?


[09/09/2021 8:07 PM] Cody#9591
no overclocks nothing


[09/09/2021 8:07 PM] Cody#9591
in hiveos


[09/09/2021 8:16 PM] andee#4722
first guess would be psu


[09/09/2021 8:16 PM] Cody#9591
psu?


[09/09/2021 8:16 PM] Cody#9591
how so?


[09/09/2021 8:18 PM] andee#4722
unstable voltage, not able to supply the surge current needed


[09/09/2021 8:20 PM] andee#4722
power draw spikes every block, psu should be oversized by at least 30%


[09/09/2021 8:21 PM] Cody#9591
yeah so it crashed on srb miner as well


[09/09/2021 8:21 PM] Cody#9591
hmm


[09/09/2021 8:21 PM] Cody#9591
it is quite oversized tho


[09/09/2021 8:21 PM] Cody#9591
even if all were pulling 200


[09/09/2021 8:21 PM] Cody#9591
should i set a vdd for the core for them?


[09/09/2021 8:21 PM] Cody#9591
and try again?


[09/09/2021 8:21 PM] andee#4722
my polaris cards report +-80, hash at 124, spike at 180W when creating dataset


[09/09/2021 8:22 PM] Cody#9591
its a 900 watt for 3 vegas


[09/09/2021 8:22 PM] Cody#9591
and a 650 watt for board/fans/vega


[09/09/2021 8:23 PM] MikeyMike87#9350

[09/09/2021 8:25 PM] Cody#9591
could that do anything?


[09/09/2021 9:04 PM] Pharotek#2932
So my trouble Vega 56 REF card i disassembled again today. Thing I found what could be causing the high HMB2 temps. The plate has a bulge in it.

Anyone with a spare parts bin for these looking to sell one?


[09/09/2021 9:27 PM] apexpool#3878
I was happy to early, the 3080 FE order was cancelled, they probably sold more than they had üò©


[09/09/2021 10:47 PM] geezar#8187
was going to suggest picking up a 'parts only' purchase but people are selling those even for $$$$


[09/09/2021 10:50 PM] Pharotek#2932
yea, i'm kinda hoping @andee or @licklobster may have "extraparts"??


[09/09/2021 10:50 PM] Pharotek#2932
huh odd lick name thing didn't work


[09/09/2021 10:52 PM] andee#4722
sorry, nothing here üò¶ but.. do a search on the server, if my memory isn't messing with me there was someone that bought 4 vega's and 1 was broken

[09/09/2021 10:54 PM] rav1986#4319
It any good? Is a mini card


[09/09/2021 11:01 PM] Pharotek#2932
oh wow, I know he has lots of spare parts i'll pm him too then


[09/09/2021 11:02 PM] Pharotek#2932
if not mistaken, that is the Dell version nexus gamer did a review of it


[09/09/2021 11:03 PM] rav1986#4319
@Pharotek by chance you know where I can see the review results?


[09/09/2021 11:03 PM] Pharotek#2932

im assuming bios settings would solve this but a touch clarity on which ones would be nice, i cant seem to do this in desktop or do i use nvidia control panel?

WELLL! That was pure F*&^King hell!


[09/10/2021 7:05 AM] Pharotek#2932

[09/10/2021 7:05 AM] Pharotek#2932
and it was down for count


[09/10/2021 7:05 AM] Pharotek#2932

[09/10/2021 7:06 AM] Pharotek#2932
Okay GPU5 is smoked


[09/10/2021 7:06 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Im stuck at work with my rig down for the past 3 hours


[09/10/2021 7:06 AM] Pharotek#2932
removed it nope still won't boot


[09/10/2021 7:07 AM] Pharotek#2932
okay, maybe overloading PSU, removed 2 more GPU's nope


[09/10/2021 7:07 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Its going to be a mystery what caused the crash until i get home


[09/10/2021 7:07 AM] Pharotek#2932
Luckly I had a spare PSU installed that


[09/10/2021 7:07 AM] Pharotek#2932
NOPE


[09/10/2021 7:07 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Could be the psu?


[09/10/2021 7:07 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Nope


[09/10/2021 7:07 AM] Pharotek#2932
Thought was the board check CPU


[09/10/2021 7:07 AM] Pharotek#2932
nope


[09/10/2021 7:07 AM] Pharotek#2932
ram nope


[09/10/2021 7:08 AM] Pharotek#2932

IT WAS THE DAM FLASH ON THE USB STICK!!! Mother FErrrrr


[09/10/2021 7:10 AM] Pharotek#2932
took the usb stick to my main PC and it showed 7 partions


[09/10/2021 7:10 AM] Pharotek#2932

[09/10/2021 7:11 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Ouch. Still better than my troubleshooting experience for the past couple of days. The conclusion i found was that im an idiot and forgot half the power plugs when i threw the rig back together 30 min before work


[09/10/2021 7:13 AM] Pharotek#2932
ouch, i can relate, my 1st rig i built I used an BTC-37 board. Had no idea until a day later after talking to someone, that the 8 PCIE ports on the front of the board needed to be plugged in too LOL


[09/10/2021 7:15 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Yeah everything is working again now one bios flash later and one look into the case.


[09/10/2021 7:15 AM] Pharotek#2932
man alive that sucked, glad it was bad flash on usb stick though and not a smoked motherboard. I don't have a spare for them yet. been builidng spare parts latley lol


[09/10/2021 7:15 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Except thw rig crashed recently for some reason


[09/10/2021 7:15 AM] Pharotek#2932
do have the hive app on smart phone?


[09/10/2021 7:16 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Yea, it says no signal. So either the power went out or the internet was dropped


[09/10/2021 7:16 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
I still have to go back into the bios and re enable boot after power loss


[09/10/2021 7:18 AM] Pharotek#2932
some times will still give you the last error message. Hope for the best for you.


[09/10/2021 7:18 AM] Pharotek#2932
a little side tip, once get that enabled


[09/10/2021 7:18 AM] Pharotek#2932
if it's on a 110 outlet


[09/10/2021 7:19 AM] Pharotek#2932
I have all my PSU that are on alexa smart outlet


[09/10/2021 7:19 AM] Pharotek#2932
then I can cycle power to the rig when not home


[09/10/2021 7:19 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
120v 20amp it should support the rig easily


[09/10/2021 7:19 AM] Pharotek#2932
yea they do


[09/10/2021 7:19 AM] Pharotek#2932
i use kasa app for them all

[09/10/2021 7:22 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
Yeah i just use the house ac until winter then i vent the sub zero air from outside to the rig


[09/10/2021 7:23 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389

directly in the shell

[09/10/2021 11:16 AM] Ananas#9063
It doesnt register keyboard input, maybe the keyboard is the issue?


[09/10/2021 11:17 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
@AnanasI use "run command"


[09/10/2021 11:18 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
you need to select the worker you want to give script to and this will be one of the options in a bar


[09/10/2021 11:19 AM] Ananas#9063
Ah so i need to launch the shell/cmd via the hive dashboard from my mobile/other pc, and only then i can type?


[09/10/2021 11:19 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
it depends on what you want to do


[09/10/2021 11:20 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
if you just want easy commands like sreboot, or miner stop you can do this easily from the run command icon


[09/10/2021 11:21 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
you can type anything here you can type on the terminal


[09/10/2021 11:21 AM] Ananas#9063
I wanna setup my wifi router using the rig's keyboard, so the pc doesnt have internet


[09/10/2021 11:22 AM] Ananas#9063
Like the issue is i dont see a terminal on the rig's display monitor, just that black screen


[09/10/2021 11:22 AM] Ananas#9063
Am I retarded?


[09/10/2021 11:22 AM] andee#4722
you don't seem to have a running shell


[09/10/2021 11:22 AM] Ananas#9063
Yes


[09/10/2021 11:22 AM] Ananas#9063
How do i start that


[09/10/2021 11:22 AM] andee#4722
it should start by itself


[09/10/2021 11:22 AM] andee#4722
try ctrl +alt + f2


[09/10/2021 11:23 AM] Ananas#9063
Ah that is it, my bios has user pass combo that i need to enter here


[09/10/2021 11:23 AM] Ananas#9063
Thank you


[09/10/2021 11:24 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
probably best to take the password off if you plan on doing a 24/7 rig

What is your OC settings?


[09/10/2021 12:09 PM] geezar#8187
still testing, not willing to accept needing to run it > 140w has become a challenge - key for this GPU 1400-1500 locked core, mem anywhere from zero to 3200 - others on here have achieved some nice findings

it's stable for days now at this 73 watts


[09/10/2021 1:17 PM] Ananas#9063
i know driver under-reports and it's higher in reality, but the rest of my 570s do 85watts minimum


[09/10/2021 1:34 PM] Fir3#0726
Hey guys, atm I have an OC on my 3080 LHR that is working very well, 160watt 220mhs, the thing is to achieve it I had to lock the mV and the core clock.
As such, when I demand a bit more of the GPU it crashes because the voltage and clocks are locked, aswell as a pretty low wattage for this card(can go up to 400w)
Can someone help me setup a miner (any miner) that would limit my hashrate to 5-10 shares every hour so that I can game for a couple hours gaming session  and not get triggered by PPLNS?
Trying to limit the miner without it affecting the card performance, so that I can game as usual


[09/10/2021 1:38 PM] andee#4722
use t-rex and set a lower intensity


[09/10/2021 1:40 PM] andee#4722
when I have been mining and gaming at the same time I have not used my mining oc, I used a different profile


[09/10/2021 1:41 PM] Fir3#0726
Is there a FAQ page to help set the intensity? I'm already using t rex

--low-load                 Low load mode (default: 0). 1 - enabled, 0 - disabled.
                                   Reduces the load on the GPUs if possible. Can be set to a comma separated string to enable
                                   the mode for a subset of the GPU list (eg: --low-load 0,0,1,0)


[09/10/2021 1:54 PM] Fir3#0726
im guessing this is it?


[09/10/2021 1:54 PM] Fir3#0726
so if I just use a diff batch file with this command and no OC settings i should get what i want, going to test


[09/10/2021 1:54 PM] andee#4722
`--intensity`


[09/10/2021 1:55 PM] andee#4722
low-load may also work, never tried it


[09/10/2021 2:00 PM] Fir3#0726
trying with both


[09/10/2021 2:00 PM] Fir3#0726
intensity 9, low-load active


[09/10/2021 2:14 PM] Fir3#0726
i think this works for me, 1 share every 10~ minutes

double check address, did you use `ADDR.WORKERNAME` as format for the miner?

@Monarchyeah the TI card is a bit tricky. I couldn't get anything above 180mh/s without upping the core clock and mem clock. not sure why they do this but it seems like the lhr is on a curve


[09/10/2021 6:20 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
@geezarI gave up on the lower wattage. I figured it wasn't really a whole lot cost to the performance since the electricity here is not terribly expensive.


[09/10/2021 6:26 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
It was the network that failed. and for w/e reason the rig wouldn't reconnect until i did a reboot

well, it depends on the price you buy the card.

2 vega 56 makes 380 and a 3080 ti makes 250mh..


[09/10/2021 8:05 PM] rav1986#4319
3080 ti is 1800e

[09/10/2021 8:05 PM] rav1986#4319
A vega 56 consumes 200w?

[09/10/2021 8:07 PM] apexpool#3878
of course, it depends on the electricity price, too. where I live 1 KWh is 0.31 Euro. I know that where you live is is much cheaper.

Same - accepted 165 MH/s at 140w - on this card 1400-1450 core 2200 mem - full send will do 185 but way up to 170w+


[09/10/2021 11:16 PM] geezar#8187
Depends mine run 125 at the wall with 79w reported - many push them hard some run more sensible OC


[09/10/2021 11:17 PM] geezar#8187
254 MH/s for 215w during testing so far, power hungry and runs hot. I've seem some run 199w for around the same or full send power will see you into 280+ MH/s but a lot more power

Going to experiment with different OC software because it makes a way bigger difference.on the 3080 than on 3070s


[09/10/2021 11:34 PM] Marty#4039
What core and mem clock?


[09/10/2021 11:35 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
core (absolute) 1800 mem 2800


[09/10/2021 11:36 PM] Marty#4039
Absolute meaning it's locked there?


[09/10/2021 11:39 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
@Martyyep and it helps lock power limit


[09/10/2021 11:40 PM] Marty#4039
What software do you use to achieve that? I haven't been able to find something yet


[09/10/2021 11:40 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
HiveOS


[09/10/2021 11:41 PM] Marty#4039
Oh cool, was planning to try that next. I like that Ill have remote control


[09/10/2021 11:41 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
it's applied after you add a certain number to core


[09/10/2021 11:41 PM] Marty#4039
I've been using windows with MSI afterburner


[09/10/2021 11:41 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
so instead of 200 you would add 2000 and it will change to absolute


[09/10/2021 11:42 PM] Marty#4039
Oh so you type the total value instead of +200 or -200 or whatever


[09/10/2021 11:42 PM] Blitzkrieg#5389
i mined for a little bit on windows really glad i went went with a linux os

you need 4 digits not 3


[09/10/2021 11:43 PM] Marty#4039
Like if I'm in afterburner I type -400 and it sets to 1200mhz, so in hive I'd just type 1200?

hii, im mining on nbminer with a 1650, i was running the core clock at 2067 (+100) but i saw someone suggest underclocking by 400mhz, so i tried it and my hashrate seems to have stayed exactly the same (~31.8MH/s). is it ok to just leave it like that? underclocking just seems a little counterintuitive


[09/11/2021 3:11 AM] soupy#1015
should probably add that my memory is overclocked to 4640mhz (+640)


[09/11/2021 3:11 AM] karola#0001
autolykos2 is a memory heavy algorithm, mining with higher memory clocks and better memory timings would help you to get more hashrate. im running my rx 570 with -200 core clock and power consumption went around 76W to 60W which decreased my temps 70 to 60. Less heat, less watts, less pressure on the card.


[09/11/2021 3:12 AM] soupy#1015
oh cool, does that mean i can push the core clocks as low as i want until it starts affecting hashrate?


[09/11/2021 3:15 AM] karola#0001
Of course you can until your hashrates aren't effected. Mine can do -%17 less core clock and stay at the same hashrate. It's a silicon lottery. Memory is more important in this algorithm.


[09/11/2021 3:16 AM] soupy#1015

nice numbers @Blitzkrieg guessing locked core at 1700 working well, I usually run 1500 around the same power with mem 2600 but 2-3 MH/s lower


[09/11/2021 8:34 AM] geezar#8187
That said 1450 with less mem will have you 168 for 120-125 - depends on the GPU for sub 130w if best place to be IMO


[09/11/2021 8:36 AM] fay#5512
I found that mining ERG on 3060 isn‚Äôt affected by limitation. To get 50mhs on ETH, 3060 need to use 470.05 driver and must be on PCIe 16x lane. But not on ERG, can run full 125mhs on riser without the need of 470.05 driver. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong


[09/11/2021 8:39 AM] geezar#8187
Generally V2 60 will do circa 119 MH/s on this algo, V1 will run 124-126 - all 3060's are LHR, the more aggressive LHR on the more recent cards


[09/11/2021 8:40 AM] fay#5512
Mine is V1. It can run 125mhs on riser on HiveOS


[09/11/2021 8:40 AM] geezar#8187
As there was never a non LHR - we'll never know what it could have done on ERG


[09/11/2021 8:41 AM] geezar#8187
yes 460.39 - all day long -200/2700 and 100PL - 110PL - I've seen as high as 127.50 but at higher mem

But the power is quite high tho. 125mhs at 129W


[09/11/2021 10:24 AM] geezar#8187
Never had to run any higher than 110 PL - 100 PL is most efficient @fay 100% you do not need that much power


[09/11/2021 10:24 AM] geezar#8187
on Linux 99w-110w max (V2 + V1)


[09/11/2021 10:25 AM] geezar#8187
Windows same - even on ETH at 50-51 MH/s 110-115w some months back


[09/11/2021 10:25 AM] fay#5512
My card is shit then. When I limit to 115W it lowered down to 75mhs. Lol


[09/11/2021 10:58 AM] geezar#8187
Tell me its a V1 correct? @fay ?


[09/11/2021 10:58 AM] geezar#8187
what driver/exact OC settings are you using dude


[09/11/2021 11:25 AM] fay#5512
Yes V1


[09/11/2021 11:25 AM] fay#5512

[09/11/2021 4:45 PM] geezar#8187
Core 1600? most of mine run -200 offset core usually sits around 1250-1300 for 105-110w - 125-126

Hello ErgoFriends, i'm very new and want to start to mining Ergo, I wish you could help me with this question, i have some nvidia 3060s and a couple of 3070ti's, What Nvidia Driver and Miner software is the best ?


[09/11/2021 5:08 PM] oSHINSAo#9027
i've seen that to score the highest MHs i have to use N: 460.39 is this still to date the best Driver versions ?


[09/11/2021 7:24 PM] geezar#8187
@oSHINSAo all documented extensively - the 3060's are they V1 or V2? 3070ti will not work with 460.39 - V1 3060's only - so a mixed rig is not an option (confirm if they are V1's and people here will be able to help you) üëç


[09/11/2021 8:26 PM] Anjaneyyyy#2882
i accidently changed my coinex wallet deposit address while i was mining on the old address and i still have some erg on the old address will i still recieve the erg in my wallet after mining?


[09/11/2021 8:26 PM] oSHINSAo#9027
Thank you @geezar i've just downgrade Nvidia to 460.39, but rig seems to no respond, btc-s37 is making Reboot sounds constantly, is this normal ? is it ok if i hard restart the motherboard or should i wait ?

Anyone know if it‚Äôs possible to setup a node and mine solo on hive os?


[09/11/2021 9:37 PM] shinyumbreon#2454
If rather do that than mine on a solo pool


[09/11/2021 9:48 PM] geezar#8187
It will not boot with an LHR GPU on 460.39


[09/11/2021 9:48 PM] geezar#8187
Suggest remove the LHR GPU and spin it up with just the V1 3060


[09/11/2021 9:48 PM] geezar#8187
If you mix them (even one) will not book


[09/11/2021 9:48 PM] geezar#8187
Boot*


[09/11/2021 9:49 PM] geezar#8187
Other option is newer driver, downside is .39 nice on the V1‚Äôs


[09/11/2021 9:50 PM] geezar#8187
FWIW will not matter what mobo is used. The 70ti/80ti or anything other than the V1 3060 will stop it booting


[09/11/2021 9:52 PM] geezar#8187
I split V1 3060 and newer LHR of different rigs. (1 with 460.39 - 1 with LHR compatible build) let me know how you get on and good luck


[09/12/2021 12:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
Stupid question, do you have to turn off your hive OS rig to add another gpu?


[09/12/2021 1:23 AM] MasterG#9359
Hello.  How can I find out the full history of my mining to the pool.  Looks like the page only shows last 7 days, and nothing before that. Thanks


[09/12/2021 2:44 AM] callie#3352
Anyone use 2060 super? Any oc settings?


[09/12/2021 3:59 AM] Stealthmatt#1196
Can I use the same OC settings as eth


[09/12/2021 7:16 AM] apexpool#3878
yes, don't try to do it without switching it off and even better removing the power from the PSU (or setting the switch to 0 on the psu near the power cable, if the psu has one).


[09/12/2021 7:48 AM] geezar#8187
@oSHINSAo did you try as I suggested - working now?


[09/12/2021 4:20 PM] chad NIETZSCHE#0912

do you see any improvements on ergo?


[09/12/2021 5:54 PM] SnowPea#7485
Interesting, i used lolminer before, the only problem i had was that when the miner crashed/restarted, it cleared out my oc settings in msi afterburner


[09/12/2021 5:56 PM] apexpool#3878
let us know if you see any improvement please

miner firing up.. ü§û


[09/12/2021 6:15 PM] andee#4722
no difference, changing driver to see if that helps


[09/12/2021 6:16 PM] apexpool#3878
they are recommending a specific version, maybe it helps.


[09/12/2021 6:17 PM] andee#4722
5% on the way to one of the recommended ones, would be so cool if it actually works on autolykos


[09/12/2021 6:25 PM] andee#4722
performance dropped.. hmm

465.31 now


[09/12/2021 7:20 PM] geezar#8187

now it is too late.


[09/12/2021 7:23 PM] geezar#8187
also if you have to RMA even in 2-3 years if it has been messed with (obvious signs of tampering) could void it..


[09/12/2021 7:23 PM] apexpool#3878
he was trying to make a rig for eth and bought a few 3070 ti, not knowing about LHR


[09/12/2021 7:23 PM] geezar#8187
the positive is - they are selling for much $$$


[09/12/2021 7:23 PM] geezar#8187

parameter "intensity" improves hashrate on autolykos with t-rex miner? or what it does exactly?


[09/13/2021 3:34 AM] Serotonina#2676
wtf

[09/13/2021 5:43 AM] apexpool#3878
yes, it seems so. different intensity leads to different hashrates with the same overclocking values. I tested many values for hours until I found out the optimal values. lower intensity values (default was 21.1 if I remember correctly) was suggested by the t-rex developer. I tried different values between 16 and 24 until.


[09/13/2021 5:50 AM] Serotonina#2676
my rig is x5 RTX 3060 NVIDIA driver 460.39, r the first version of the RTX 3060 that runs with driver 460.39, u think ill get better hashrates with t rex miner? rn im using NBMiner 38.2, im gettin 122-123 MH/s on each one


[09/13/2021 5:55 AM] Serotonina#2676
my settings r 2600 of memory clock on hiveos, 105 w


[09/13/2021 5:58 AM] apexpool#3878
I tried different miners, and other people, too, and t-rex had the best results for NVidia cards. you should try it, too.


[09/13/2021 5:59 AM] apexpool#3878
not a big difference, 1-2 MH/s more, but it seems more stable, at least with LHR cards (in my case).

[09/13/2021 6:01 AM] Serotonina#2676
werent*


[09/13/2021 6:05 AM] apexpool#3878
yes, because lolMiner reports the real hashrate, not an average like NBminer or t-rex.


[09/13/2021 7:58 AM] Dv#3650
if you want to see your true hashrate go look at what the pool is reporting


[09/13/2021 8:23 AM] Dv#3650
alright


[09/13/2021 8:23 AM] Dv#3650

same for t-rex, also after a reboot, high cpu usage by xorg(?)

Good content this - for some miners with smaller budgets or finding the barrier of entry too high - good to see. I started with a single PC like this and expanded with risers, very small build to get into mining for less than a new 30 series single GPU is a great way to start

struggling with my new 3060 ti Eagle LHR, using HiveOs and NBminer, trying to do the locked core as posted. But it just hits the LHR straight away and drops.

Is this correct command to run: nvidia-smi -i 0 -lgc 795
The ID of the GPU is 0 right (I have only one card atm).
or do I just do absolute core clock, what do i set that to while using the lgc command?


[09/15/2021 3:46 PM] apexpool#3878
I have the Eagle OC LHR, and I am using -625 for cclock in hiveOS directly and 2650 for mclock. -625 was the magic that raised the hashrate from 80-90 to 135 MH/s.


[09/15/2021 3:46 PM] MylesAbove#3307
Thanks, and your PL?


[09/15/2021 3:47 PM] apexpool#3878
100w


[09/15/2021 3:47 PM] apexpool#3878
101 is too much.


[09/15/2021 3:47 PM] MylesAbove#3307
lol


[09/15/2021 3:47 PM] apexpool#3878
an 100 is actually the minimum possible


[09/15/2021 3:47 PM] MylesAbove#3307
ill try now, so u didnt use the -lgc command?


[09/15/2021 3:48 PM] apexpool#3878
I am playing with fan lock to keep the temperature at about 56-58C. if it drops (lower temperature), LHR kicks in.


[09/15/2021 3:48 PM] apexpool#3878
no. I am using t-rex with intensity 20, and the rest of the options at overclocking in hiveos.


[09/15/2021 3:49 PM] MylesAbove#3307
oh mine might be too cool


[09/15/2021 3:50 PM] MylesAbove#3307
so if it gets cool it triggers LHR?

yes.

[09/15/2021 3:50 PM] apexpool#3878
probably lower the power would help, but you cannot set lower than 100w


[09/15/2021 3:51 PM] MylesAbove#3307
i think u can cant u


[09/15/2021 3:51 PM] MylesAbove#3307
i hit 135 but its dropping slowly


[09/15/2021 3:51 PM] apexpool#3878
no, 100w is the lowest possible in linux / hiveos. try and it will tell you.


[09/15/2021 3:51 PM] MylesAbove#3307

[09/15/2021 3:51 PM] apexpool#3878

your card is the non-OC version, maybe it is a little different.


[09/15/2021 3:52 PM] MylesAbove#3307
my PL is at 95W on OC, but the card is at 100W i see


[09/15/2021 3:52 PM] apexpool#3878
mine is Eagle OC


[09/15/2021 3:52 PM] MylesAbove#3307

[09/15/2021 3:52 PM] MylesAbove#3307
we have the exact same card


[09/15/2021 3:52 PM] MylesAbove#3307
so the LHR doesnt fully trigger with temp? mine went from 135 to 128?


[09/15/2021 3:53 PM] MylesAbove#3307
i might try trex with intensity 20

the first thing I would do is just look at the output when the miner starts, you will probably be able to read what causes the problem

[09/15/2021 4:22 PM] andee#4722
you have to watch that 1 minute until it decides to restart, usually its something like GPU x DEAD, RUNNING WATCHDOG SCRIPT

ill let it run for a bit


[09/15/2021 4:22 PM] apexpool#3878
if they manage to unlock the LHR, 3060ti can do a lot more, I guess.


[09/15/2021 4:22 PM] MylesAbove#3307

[09/15/2021 4:24 PM] apexpool#3878
decrease the pl with 1w at a time, until you find the right one


[09/15/2021 4:25 PM] MylesAbove#3307
will do


[09/15/2021 4:25 PM] apexpool#3878
and watch the temperature, too.


[09/15/2021 4:25 PM] username.io I OCM5937#7228
It just works as normal and then the computer restarts without any notice.


[09/15/2021 4:34 PM] MylesAbove#3307
how do you see how much you have mined on HiveOS?


[09/15/2021 4:52 PM] geezar#8187
Nice I'm running much lower hash - 165 for around 142w now - may revisit chasing higher on this card later


[09/15/2021 5:38 PM] specter#2802
Hi guys, have any of you experience using GeForce RTX 3070 GAMING Z TRIO 8G LHR for mining?


[09/15/2021 7:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sheeesh


[09/15/2021 7:23 PM] geezar#8187
Yep sometimes the power is not worth it, for some less of a concern but 15 MH/s for 30w - we'll see - this GPU does not like to hash well


[09/15/2021 7:24 PM] geezar#8187
Up to 170w it will sit at 180+ but trying to get them down - some run 131w for 156 MH/s - all depends on goals for efficiency


[09/15/2021 7:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
I see


[09/15/2021 7:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Problem is with my card

[09/15/2021 7:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
And now I‚Äôm doing 102 hash at 150 watts


[09/15/2021 8:57 PM] Ananas#9063
is there a general overclocking/tuning rule you can set up in HiveOS to always set the same overclock settings to all X model cards?


[09/15/2021 8:58 PM] Ananas#9063
For example I do the settings for 3070, and no matter when or how many 3070s I add the tuning settings get applied to them on the condition of their model name


[09/15/2021 8:59 PM] Ananas#9063
my issue is I swap my cards daily, and today for example I swapped my 3060 to a 1060, and the 3060's settings got automatically applied to the 1060, so the rig insta crashed. i would like to avoid this, even if it's not though the above solution


[09/15/2021 9:00 PM] andee#4722
why are you swapping cards daily? ü§î


[09/15/2021 9:00 PM] andee#4722
I dont think there is anything like that built in, would have to DIY a solution


[09/15/2021 9:02 PM] Ananas#9063
hmm I'll look around


[09/15/2021 9:02 PM] Ananas#9063
I have a rig that only mines with cards that are only here for short-term


[09/15/2021 9:03 PM] Ananas#9063
I sell/buy cards constantly


[09/15/2021 9:03 PM] Ananas#9063
card arrives, i put it on the mine, someone buys the card, I get it off basically


[09/15/2021 9:03 PM] andee#4722
would be easier to just set stock clocks, shutdown and swap


[09/15/2021 9:04 PM] Ananas#9063

ya, i will try that


[09/15/2021 9:05 PM] Ananas#9063
i just get confused cause the numbering on HiveOS makes it a bit difficult to know which card is in which pcie split


[09/15/2021 9:05 PM] Ananas#9063
slot*


[09/15/2021 9:05 PM] Ananas#9063
cause of the 1-4 pcie splitters


[09/15/2021 9:05 PM] Ananas#9063
but i guess im retarded for not thinking of your solution first


[09/15/2021 9:06 PM] andee#4722
set 100% or 1% fan


[09/15/2021 9:06 PM] Ananas#9063
i found that some cards refuse to do 1% fan, or was that an exception?


[09/15/2021 9:06 PM] Ananas#9063
almost like they have a minimum setting like 20% or stmh


[09/15/2021 9:07 PM] andee#4722
0 in hive sets it to auto, might be a limit on how low they go also


[09/15/2021 9:07 PM] Ananas#9063
ah ye


[09/15/2021 9:07 PM] Ananas#9063

the miners that have LHRtuning, have you guys tried see if it helps with ERGO mining on LHR RTX?


[09/16/2021 3:42 AM] Canberry#7404
--lhr only works on eth

{Reactions}
ü•≤ 

[09/16/2021 4:40 AM] MylesAbove#3307
anyone try BIOS flashing to earlier LHR versions?


[09/16/2021 4:40 AM] MylesAbove#3307
new RTX are like v3 LHR now arent they


[09/16/2021 4:53 AM] MylesAbove#3307
@apexpool howd you go setting fan speeds? I am currently using HiveOS autofan set to 55c, fluctuates 54-56. Interesting to know what triggers LHR - the low temp? or change in PL


[09/16/2021 6:07 AM] apexpool#3878
I'm setting the fan at 55% if the room's windows is open or 60% - 70% if the window is closed, depending on the temperature. I'm not using autofan.


[09/16/2021 6:08 AM] MylesAbove#3307
autofan working for me


[09/16/2021 6:08 AM] apexpool#3878
I assume the card is more efficient at lower temps, and the LHR kicks in because it detects mining


[09/16/2021 6:09 AM] MylesAbove#3307
i just tried set temp at 50c and it hits 138 Mhs, then drops then goes back up


[09/16/2021 6:09 AM] MylesAbove#3307
so its PL but not full LHR trigger


[09/16/2021 6:09 AM] MylesAbove#3307
yeah


[09/16/2021 6:09 AM] apexpool#3878
I have 1 x 3060 ti and 3 x 3070 ti, the settings and temperatures are different, I cannot use autofan.


[09/16/2021 6:09 AM] MylesAbove#3307
so odd


[09/16/2021 6:09 AM] MylesAbove#3307
oh fair enough


[09/16/2021 6:09 AM] apexpool#3878
I keep the 3070s at lower temperatures.


[09/16/2021 6:09 AM] MylesAbove#3307
i bought 6 eagle OC so i will autofan whole thing


[09/16/2021 6:10 AM] MylesAbove#3307
ok i think i found the temp limit


[09/16/2021 6:10 AM] apexpool#3878
I'm sorry I did not buy more than 1 Eagle OC, and they were out of stock in minutes.


[09/16/2021 6:10 AM] MylesAbove#3307
49C is the limit


[09/16/2021 6:10 AM] MylesAbove#3307
i believe


[09/16/2021 6:10 AM] MylesAbove#3307
with my PL


[09/16/2021 6:11 AM] MylesAbove#3307
yeah i initially preordered the Gigabyte OC Pro but got these instead


[09/16/2021 6:12 AM] apexpool#3878
what hashrate do you get now?


[09/16/2021 6:12 AM] MylesAbove#3307
138


[09/16/2021 6:12 AM] MylesAbove#3307
solid for the time being


[09/16/2021 6:13 AM] MylesAbove#3307
so weird it went down then back up initially


[09/16/2021 6:13 AM] MylesAbove#3307
its like u have a few moments before it fully triggers LHR


[09/16/2021 6:14 AM] apexpool#3878
I'm at 137.8 now, fluctuating a little, now 137.95


[09/16/2021 6:14 AM] MylesAbove#3307
def feels like 49C is the limit


[09/16/2021 6:15 AM] apexpool#3878
the 3070ti cards are more sensitive


[09/16/2021 6:15 AM] MylesAbove#3307
low-mid 50s might be best


[09/16/2021 6:15 AM] MylesAbove#3307
more than this?


[09/16/2021 6:15 AM] apexpool#3878
my Eagle OC works best at 56-58C, I cannot set it lower


[09/16/2021 6:15 AM] MylesAbove#3307
do u think we will get a LHR bypass eventually for ergo?


[09/16/2021 6:16 AM] MylesAbove#3307
yeah maybe they are individual which will be annoying


[09/16/2021 6:16 AM] apexpool#3878
the 3070 ti are working better at lower temperatures, and they need lower power, which is possible, so I can keep them cooler.


[09/16/2021 6:16 AM] MylesAbove#3307
should i do testing on each individually?


[09/16/2021 6:16 AM] apexpool#3878
I hope so.


[09/16/2021 6:17 AM] apexpool#3878
do you have more cards?


[09/16/2021 6:18 AM] MylesAbove#3307
i have all 6


[09/16/2021 6:18 AM] MylesAbove#3307
all eagle oc


[09/16/2021 6:21 AM] apexpool#3878
I thought you have one and just ordered the rest.


[09/16/2021 6:21 AM] MylesAbove#3307
nope


[09/16/2021 6:21 AM] MylesAbove#3307
preodered all 6 back in Feb lol


[09/16/2021 6:22 AM] apexpool#3878
you can try different settings, but the difference won't be too much. I am using different settings for each 3070 ti to maximize the hashrate.


[09/16/2021 6:22 AM] apexpool#3878
different PL actually


[09/16/2021 6:22 AM] apexpool#3878
OC settings identical


[09/16/2021 10:12 AM] MylesAbove#3307
@apexpool Ok, interesting follow-up, second Eagle is requiring 110W PL


[09/16/2021 10:13 AM] apexpool#3878
same hashrate?


[09/16/2021 10:13 AM] MylesAbove#3307
little bit less at 135.5


[09/16/2021 10:13 AM] MylesAbove#3307
havent changed anything but the PL so far


[09/16/2021 10:14 AM] apexpool#3878
once you find the best OC settings, you only need to adjust PL, I guess.


[09/16/2021 10:14 AM] MylesAbove#3307
seems that way


[09/16/2021 10:14 AM] apexpool#3878
and maybe fan


[09/16/2021 10:14 AM] MylesAbove#3307
yeah


[09/16/2021 10:14 AM] MylesAbove#3307
hoping all require same fan so i can not worry about ambient temps


[09/16/2021 10:16 AM] MylesAbove#3307
ok 115W too much lol


[09/16/2021 10:29 AM] MylesAbove#3307
111W getting 138MH/s


[09/16/2021 10:35 AM] Fir3#0726
Can't u set the target temp on fans? That way it regulates alone


[09/16/2021 10:36 AM] Fir3#0726
Also o suggest using the curve controller, a bit more time intensive to test, but better results


[09/16/2021 10:36 AM] Fir3#0726
Lock the mV and the core clock on curve controller


[09/16/2021 10:36 AM] MylesAbove#3307
curve controller on HiveOS?


[09/16/2021 10:36 AM] Fir3#0726
Oh, nvm didn't read that part


[09/16/2021 10:36 AM] Fir3#0726
Which miner are u using then?


[09/16/2021 10:36 AM] MylesAbove#3307
Trex


[09/16/2021 10:37 AM] Fir3#0726
Great


[09/16/2021 10:37 AM] Fir3#0726
That's the only one that supports proper control of the OC


[09/16/2021 10:37 AM] MylesAbove#3307
if i get 135-138 MH on LHR 3060 Ti, I'll be happy


[09/16/2021 10:38 AM] Fir3#0726
I get 220mhs on 3080 with 160 watt

{Reactions}
ü•≤ 

[09/16/2021 10:39 AM] Fir3#0726
It's 1350 ish efficiency


[09/16/2021 10:39 AM] Fir3#0726
But I can only achieve that by locking the mV and cclock


[09/16/2021 10:41 AM] Fir3#0726
Looking at that excel from reddit 3060 ti can be very efficient, try and see a baseline for cclock locking and mV lock


[09/16/2021 10:41 AM] Fir3#0726
If you need the commands for t rex I can copy mine here in a bit, and you adjust


[09/16/2021 10:42 AM] MylesAbove#3307
sure that'll be great!

[09/16/2021 10:48 AM] Fir3#0726
Try a setting like that, and adjust until stable


[09/16/2021 10:49 AM] Fir3#0726
I would be happy with 150mhs at 110 watts


[09/16/2021 10:50 AM] Fir3#0726
That very efficient


[09/16/2021 10:51 AM] MylesAbove#3307
don't think it's possible to get 150 on LHR 3060 ti


[09/16/2021 11:08 AM] Fir3#0726
I wouldn't know, don't have one


[09/16/2021 11:09 AM] Fir3#0726
My point still stands, you can check that excel table and try your own OC


[09/16/2021 11:09 AM] Fir3#0726
üòÖ


[09/16/2021 11:17 AM] geezar#8187
if that is LHR its amazing result, for non - should be closer to 170 MH/s low 120w üëç


[09/16/2021 11:25 AM] MylesAbove#3307
Yeah I'm happy with it, thanks to @apexpool for the OC settings!


[09/16/2021 11:36 AM] geezar#8187
Apex has some of the lowest power settings around - nice


[09/16/2021 11:37 AM] apexpool#3878
maybe it's the mainboard quality, I don't know


[09/16/2021 11:38 AM] geezar#8187
not sure, I've been chasing your settings for weeks lol and failing üôÇ


[09/16/2021 11:42 AM] apexpool#3878
there's difference even between my cards, one is hungrier, it's eating 2w more than the others for the same hashrate


[09/16/2021 11:44 AM] geezar#8187
Yep - 10w differential is common, I'm settling for the lower power and hash TBH


[09/16/2021 11:44 AM] geezar#8187
Lower for this* GPU that is

anyone on wooly that knows how the pplns system works? If I have 3 gpus mining on wooly, then I decide to switch it to 1 gpu, will that reset my participation/effort?


[09/16/2021 6:02 PM] bbot#6878
been mining on wooly a while and from my understanding, long term miners are rewarded higher


[09/16/2021 6:03 PM] bbot#6878
just want to make sure i don't lose that long term miner status


[09/16/2021 7:58 PM] miner29#2975
pay per last N shares (dont know value of N but maybe the site tells you in faq).  Meaning you have your full credit but you dont get paid anything until a block is found by pool.  Then your payment will be based on your % of the last N shares submitted by all miners to the pool.


[09/16/2021 8:04 PM] andee#4722
you have a 2 hour window to get worker back online. reducing hash on a worker should not affect it from my understanding

I believe so.

Shame, seen some reasonable deals on the lhr v2, no sense in risking it

I will stick to TI cards


[09/17/2021 10:50 AM] woundedgoat#1454
I managed to get a 3070 evga, was listed as a TI, even got a part refund. 172mhs and 120w


[09/17/2021 10:50 AM] woundedgoat#1454
Would love 6 more of them üòÖ


[09/17/2021 10:51 AM] apexpool#3878
good numbers


[09/17/2021 10:51 AM] woundedgoat#1454
And cost ¬£650, can hardly get a 3060ti for that right now


[09/17/2021 6:54 PM] geezar#8187
You will get circa 85-90 or 125-130w for around 150 on the Hynix, as some have pushed much harder to 200+ but at a penalty for a lot more power - all in the pinned clock google sheet üëç

[09/18/2021 1:06 PM] MylesAbove#3307
Nice numbers, I'm also building a 3060 Ti LHR rig.
The LHR is annoying as low temps, too much PL triggers mine.
I have a very different OC profile compared to yours;
most around (so far): 104-110 PL, -625 core, 2650 Memory with temps set at 52c (under 50 the hashrate slowly drops). Mine are Samsung memory so will perform differently. Average 135-138 MH/s on Trex using HiveOS.


[09/18/2021 1:10 PM] Rene P#1090
138 seems like pretty much max anyone can get with 3060ti lhr in general. as much as i gather.


[09/18/2021 1:13 PM] MylesAbove#3307
Seems that way, i swear it knows if it is hashing above 138 and triggers LHR


[09/18/2021 1:14 PM] Rene P#1090
lol, probably


[09/18/2021 1:14 PM] MylesAbove#3307
I could possible tweak couple of my better ones to get more, maybe even 139 but now need look for stability


[09/18/2021 1:16 PM] Rene P#1090
i've been tweaking since morning, took up to 20minutes for some cards to fail. 45minutes in and no errors this far


[09/18/2021 1:17 PM] MylesAbove#3307
nice


[09/18/2021 1:17 PM] MylesAbove#3307
do they trigger if you reboot? sometimes mine did


[09/18/2021 1:17 PM] MylesAbove#3307
im setting the OC to be delayed in Hive


[09/18/2021 1:20 PM] Rene P#1090
nope. haven seen that yet. this core is a confusing a bit. i have it set as absolute 1365. you have -625. checking the spec says base clock is 1410. does yours mean 1410-625? and i have 1410-45 ? as i have absolute 1365


[09/18/2021 1:25 PM] MylesAbove#3307
yeah not sure tbh, i do think it's an aggressive offset


[09/18/2021 1:25 PM] MylesAbove#3307
not sure about the core mV either


[09/18/2021 1:25 PM] MylesAbove#3307
i assume if PL is low and the offset is low the core voltage would be too?


[09/18/2021 1:30 PM] Rene P#1090
when i started i didnt use the power limit at all , setting absolute core like 1300 limits the powerdraw , i added power limit after, didnt have any effect


[09/18/2021 1:31 PM] Rene P#1090
with 1300 wattage was 110ish

[09/19/2021 3:10 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
@SaluI cant recommend much but in my opinion the nvidio 30xx ti cards seem to be the next best option since all the non lhr cards are sold or going for over 3x msrp


[09/19/2021 3:11 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
you could wait but there is no guarantee many will hit the market


[09/19/2021 3:11 AM] Salu#0001

Thoughts?


[09/19/2021 3:37 AM] Blitzkrieg#5389
probably worth it to wait for old cards. could be that the large farms are trying to sell their old cards now while the price is high.

i picked up a HP Omen with a 3090 today. gonna do some mods to help keep the gpu cool and then get in on ergo mining


[09/19/2021 7:28 AM] MazeraDeville#2303
I'm new to mining.  Been putting gaming PCs together for years.

I'm using a Z270 Pro and if I have 1 gpu in it, it works fine.  No issue.

But as soon as I plug in 4x 1080ti on risers into it I get problems. I can't even load into windows. 

I can plug the 4 (on risers) + 1 (directly into the motherboard) gpu and navigate board explorer to show me that all cards are connected but as soon as I try to load into windows I am stuck in a black screen forever.

I'm not even close to maxing out the pcie lanes yet I'm getting issues with windows loading.

I've tired that mining mode and changing the pcie to gen 2 and still nothing. 

The furthest I've made it is that I got windows to detect the gpus only to go into a black screen after restarting. 

I'm trying to figure out why I'm having issues running these 4 1080ti on risers. 

Any help would be appreciated.

For some reason since installing my 3090 I am getting CUDA _ERROR_LAUNCH_FAILED errors on my two other slave gpus while trying to use my mining rig under some 3d graphic use. The 3090 is replacing a 1080ti under the same config. Its two 3070s that are taking turns at momentarily crashing while using 3D software with the 3090 .. Any ideas why?


[09/20/2021 7:21 AM] acadian.eth#2222
Having used two other different cards as main graphics cards before the 3090 while mining, the main card would be the card to crash because of the mining + clock + load, not the secondary cards that are mining

Don't let your card boost, that is when the algorithm start limiting your hash rate. Limit your power draw to just before the boost start kicking in.

Is it possible to run 10 cards off one PSU? Seems like the limiting factor is the amount of ports on the PSU. I have a 1500 watt PSU and ATM can only run 4 cards; two 3080tis and two 1060s(no more pcie connector ports left). Is it safe or okay to use pcie splitters? I'd like to make a 10-12 1060 (70-75~ watts) rig, but it seems most psus don't have enough ports for all the cables needed.

[09/22/2021 12:13 PM] andee#4722
try setting absolute core. if you are on hiveos run `watch nvtool` while you are tracking the miner output to see what happens with the clocks when hashrate drops


[09/22/2021 12:15 PM] Herk#6019
there is no such thing as a non LHR 3080ti, just FYI


[09/22/2021 12:18 PM] Herk#6019
as for the 3080ti settings, if you are after stability you can try 1500 core / 2200 mem with no PL, for hiveos that is, however it sounds like you are on windows

it seems to work fine with the ETH pools


[09/22/2021 5:06 PM] apexpool#3878

[09/22/2021 5:31 PM] E!ghtball#8231

[09/22/2021 5:32 PM] E!ghtball#8231
works fine doing that with the eth pool


[09/22/2021 5:33 PM] E!ghtball#8231
not using hiveos though.


[09/22/2021 6:01 PM] E!ghtball#8231
ok i figured it out. Instead of doing -w <worker name> like for eth you seem to have to put it at the end of the wallet address in the command line. So its <Wallet address>.workername


[09/22/2021 6:15 PM] apexpool#3878

It is but the psu must support the connections.  What make/model 1500w psu ?  The 1060s can probably get by sharing a pcie plug..the 3080tis would be a no.  Post up the make model of psu and can tell you more.

Be quiet dark power pro 12


[09/22/2021 7:03 PM] Dv#3650
I figured not for the 3080ti because they take so much power


[09/22/2021 7:08 PM] miner29#2975
I have a couple BeQuiet psus‚Ä¶they hold up well.  So yeah you can split a pcie to the two 1060s and use the peripheral connections on those two.  Should leave you 4 for the 3080tis beyond that not much you can add/split.  Consider adding a server psu for go more cards‚Ä¶just be sure that a riser/gpu stay powered by the same psu.  If you want to stay quiet then you will need a Y or W 24pin cable to link the psus.

if it is working, that is not a bad price. consider you will pay double that for a 1660 Super and have the same hashrate.


[09/23/2021 4:02 PM] geezar#8187
IMO about average (some go for more) 138 day ROI (not including power) so there are worse options, its an older Polaris GPU and depends if 4GB or 8GB really - 60-70 MH/s achievable on most of them

if it goes above 775mv then you're getting 80MH/s

Hi guys im mining ERGO on hiveos but its paying out to nicehash, my profitability on nicehash shifts from ¬£4-16 but tends to sit ¬£10 or under. after checking a hashrate calculator, i hit 750 hashrate i should be earning around ¬£13.5-14 Any advice? For example every 2 hours i should be mining ¬£1.12 roughly but currently after 2 hours worth of mining i have earned around 80p. Please @ me if you're messaging me as ive asked in a few other discords


[09/23/2021 6:55 PM] andee#4722
stop using nicehash is my only advice


[09/23/2021 6:55 PM] Hand_Sanitizer#0261
right so just direct mine to a wallet?


[09/23/2021 6:56 PM] andee#4722
it also depends on what pool you are using, if you only have been mining for 2 hours it could just have been a window of bad luck


[09/23/2021 6:57 PM] Hand_Sanitizer#0261
im using the nicehash pool i just use hiveos to basically house and run my setup


[09/23/2021 6:57 PM] Hand_Sanitizer#0261
would it just be better to find a way to find a better pool and a direct wallet to mine to


[09/23/2021 7:03 PM] andee#4722
I think that it is a better option, but you will have to decide that. I have always mined what I want directly, pool + miner devfee is enough fees for me üôÇ

which one is worse between molex and sata?


[09/24/2021 11:07 AM] acadian.eth#2222
from my understanding sata is worst and should never be used


[09/24/2021 11:07 AM] acadian.eth#2222
although TIL that molex shouldnt be used either


[09/24/2021 11:10 AM] geezar#8187
People often used both and on much lower GPU's 'got away with it' when the GPU's were pulling <100w in totality - these days with 30 series GPU's pulling 250+ and people pushing vegas well beyond 250w Sata/Molex for sure not recomended


[09/24/2021 11:10 AM] Herk#6019
never heard of bricking because you used sata or molex


[09/24/2021 11:10 AM] Herk#6019
it's generally not recommended because you'll burn your house down


[09/24/2021 11:11 AM] geezar#8187
Only time I've bricked a GPU is via a bad BIOS flash and had to recover it - a power spike could do the same but having blown 3 PSU and melted a few risers never had that happen

Hey what card would you recommend for the 200-400 price range?


[09/24/2021 11:15 AM] acadian.eth#2222
my understanding is that the 250w is coming from the 2pcie 8 pin connectors on the card?


[09/24/2021 11:15 AM] acadian.eth#2222
Is the card also supplementing from the pcie power?


[09/24/2021 11:22 AM] Herk#6019
yes, you should assume the riser would pull maximum it can


[09/24/2021 11:22 AM] Herk#6019
which is technically 75W

[09/24/2021 11:35 AM] Herk#6019
it's the same


[09/24/2021 11:40 AM] Pulsarz#9208
yes, pcie slot delivers up to 75w


[09/24/2021 11:40 AM] Pulsarz#9208
but some cards pull <= 50W from  it, depends on the card


[09/24/2021 11:52 AM] geezar#8187
One thing to note is using a meter to test some recent 30 series GPU's - whilst the reported numbers suggest for example 140-150w the reality (+ riser) often far exceeds that) for example if the actual draw of the GPU (high end 30 series) reports 200w.... the mobo and base system = 50w and the wall meter is reporting 350w... that can only mean that riser is pulling a lot of power (exceeding the max 75w)


[09/24/2021 11:52 AM] geezar#8187
suggest always measure rig base (no GPU's) at the wall


[09/24/2021 11:53 AM] geezar#8187
then add a GPU - measure reported v actual (+ riser) and try to determine - in windows this is easier using HWInfo

thanks guys just switched my rig over to pcie from molex. lots of info out there saying molex is safe but no warnings about the 3000 series cards haha


[09/24/2021 11:55 AM] acadian.eth#2222
hopefully my rig is happier on 6pin. its a crazy amount of pcie connectors to be expected from a normal PSU. my 1500w modular psu maxes out at 10 pcie connectors. 

I guess the server psus are the way to go when powering multiple gpus/risers


[09/24/2021 11:56 AM] geezar#8187
many on here have a ton of experience, maybe post up your config/setup and sure people will chime in - some larger miners on here with a ton of experience üëç


[09/24/2021 11:57 AM] geezar#8187
safety tho... those high powered GPU's and the fact people often push them hard to reach the 'golden numbers' as opposed to lower power efficiency... only a matter of time before we hear some bad news..

add in the mix 'non premium' PSU cables, poor quality components or simply bad luck... not a nice smell either having blown a riser due to incompetance and a PSU smell on fire stays with you. Rig was set for ETH then x16r came out, did not modify the settings and the GPU's at points on the algo used x2 the power... lesson learned - these days I never max out any setups and always aim for 80% max duty on the PSU's

yikes. so realistically the only cards that should be on risers with molex are cards that use less than 75w?


[09/24/2021 12:04 PM] acadian.eth#2222
3 hours ago thanks I will push the update to trex


[09/24/2021 12:05 PM] andee#4722
connector quality, crimping and cabling varies from manufacturer to manufacturer and even between different models from the same manufacturer


[09/24/2021 12:07 PM] andee#4722
I am only using sata and molex and according to many my house should have burned down many times by now, there is just no simple answer. the only thing that has melted was a pci-e splitter


[09/24/2021 12:07 PM] andee#4722
but I have also been checking temperatures on connectors and cables with a IR thermometer for every new algo and tuning


[09/24/2021 12:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sata, just don‚Äôt use either please


[09/24/2021 12:10 PM] Deleted User#0000

[09/24/2021 12:36 PM] acadian.eth#2222
my temps are all 2-3c lower since switching to 6 pin, odd


[09/24/2021 12:36 PM] acadian.eth#2222
heat probably hasnt built up for 24+ hours yet lol.


[09/24/2021 3:38 PM] SnowPea#7485
Thank you! i just updated trex and im not sure if the power is displaying correctly, but my 3060 is doing 117mh with only 90w (sometimes drops to 88w)!

Hello everyone, just joined the discord. I‚Äôm very interested in mining ERGO and really don‚Äôt know where to start. I‚Äôm reading about it on their site and have funds allocated for gpu‚Äôs. Any resources you all could provide to get me started would be greatly appreciated.


[09/24/2021 4:50 PM] geezar#8187
nice!


[09/24/2021 5:02 PM] apexpool#3878
I've got another Vega 56 Asus Rog Strix, identical to the first one that was not working, and this wan also seems to have problems üò¢


[09/24/2021 5:03 PM] apexpool#3878
arrived a few hours ago.


[09/24/2021 5:04 PM] apexpool#3878
on the mining rig it crashes when starting to mine, on a windows computer it works for a while (games), but from time to time a message from "AMD Software" appears that there is a problem.


[09/24/2021 5:05 PM] geezar#8187
Has it been flashed? maybe worth switching the BIOS switch over as a quick test


[09/24/2021 5:05 PM] geezar#8187
DDU the drivers ofc too just in case


[09/24/2021 5:06 PM] apexpool#3878
I will try, just waiting to finish the job


[09/24/2021 5:06 PM] apexpool#3878
I had a few meetings, just finished one that lasted more than 2 hours


[09/24/2021 5:06 PM] geezar#8187
nice - I've seen people unable to find the switch before - damn silly small switch too lol

I've modded my Asus with 56 BIOS  assuming its a Samsung or Hynix?


[09/24/2021 5:07 PM] apexpool#3878
I guess I must shutdown the computer before switching that


[09/24/2021 5:07 PM] apexpool#3878
Hynix


[09/24/2021 5:07 PM] geezar#8187
2 hours... value usually goes after 20mins surely... screw that


[09/24/2021 5:07 PM] geezar#8187
56 Then - people hate on the Hynix but they can run low power and hash well


[09/24/2021 5:08 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, planned 1 hour, but this one Fridays almost always takes 2 hours.


[09/24/2021 5:08 PM] geezar#8187
"sorry your breaking up... wifi problem" (assuming not in a face to face meeting) works well


[09/24/2021 5:08 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, it's 56, identical to the first one I had for short time


[09/24/2021 5:09 PM] geezar#8187
They hash lower than Samsung on ETH (52 MH/s or pushing out to 53 is possible but too much power) on ERG all day long 150-175 at good levels


[09/24/2021 5:09 PM] SnowPea#7485
It didnt help much on the non lhr 3060ti and lhr 3060ti, but definitely a boost to my 3060


[09/24/2021 5:10 PM] geezar#8187
awesome - funnily enough I did notice (maybe placebo) but a slight lift on a V1 3060


[09/24/2021 5:11 PM] SnowPea#7485
Mine is v2, im still tweaking the Tis tho, hope i'll have some break through


[09/24/2021 5:27 PM] geezar#8187
@SnowPea some of the V2 60 guys have managed 119 MH/s all day and 134-137 on 60ti  seems common on the ti what are you seeing?


[09/24/2021 5:28 PM] geezar#8187
Rene posted these up in this thread - pretty good spread IMO

[09/24/2021 5:44 PM] SnowPea#7485
Wow thats awesome, i couldnt get the mem clock over 1000, it crashes in a few minutes at 1050, crashes immediately at 1100


[09/24/2021 5:53 PM] geezar#8187
spot the non LHR 60ti @SnowPea üòâ


[09/24/2021 5:54 PM] geezar#8187
TBH bro - those numbers are not the higest but far from the worst - 117 is not too far away from 119 but 90w??!!! üôÇ


[09/24/2021 5:54 PM] SnowPea#7485
Just tried to up the mem clock to 1075, crashed right away lol


[09/24/2021 5:55 PM] SnowPea#7485
Yea, that 3060 is really doing a great job


[09/24/2021 5:55 PM] geezar#8187
for sure


[09/24/2021 5:55 PM] geezar#8187
what clocks for 90w man thats awesome!


[09/24/2021 5:55 PM] SnowPea#7485
It bounces between 86w to 93w from time to time


[09/24/2021 5:55 PM] geezar#8187
locking core?


[09/24/2021 5:56 PM] SnowPea#7485

[09/24/2021 5:57 PM] geezar#8187
so 90w.... I would be damn happy with that for 117 MH/s


[09/24/2021 5:57 PM] SnowPea#7485
I had to set the fan to target core temp to 52, otherwise if i set the fan to 70%, it's too cool during the night and lhr will kick in, if i set to 60%, it'll be too hot during the day


[09/24/2021 5:57 PM] geezar#8187
1400 is 2800 in linux - some do 2900... but most sit much better 2600-2700 so you are pushing hard on the mem tbh


[09/24/2021 5:58 PM] SnowPea#7485
Yea, im very happy about it too, before update, i could get 117mh with 93w, it dropped to 90w after the update


[09/24/2021 5:58 PM] geezar#8187
walk away from the rig... slowly and don't mess with anything... you know the drill when you hit the magic numbers... dont fk with it üòâ lol


[09/24/2021 5:58 PM] SnowPea#7485
I saw the pinned post, i thought ppl are pushing it to 1500 mem clock


[09/24/2021 5:58 PM] geezar#8187
runs way too hot IMO


[09/24/2021 5:59 PM] SnowPea#7485
But lhr kicks in at 48c


[09/24/2021 5:59 PM] geezar#8187
same as the 60ti you have - 2600/1300 is a good place to be IMO


[09/24/2021 5:59 PM] geezar#8187
The LHR kicks in depending on the heat? more the OC no?


[09/24/2021 6:00 PM] SnowPea#7485
Mine is the temp


[09/24/2021 6:00 PM] geezar#8187
wow mind blown


[09/24/2021 6:00 PM] SnowPea#7485
Let me show you


[09/24/2021 6:00 PM] geezar#8187
mem will hold for a while higher but often causes bad shares so watch out for that I guess


[09/24/2021 6:01 PM] geezar#8187
90w gotta be around the lowest - if you check a few months back the 1st LHR V2 60 I landed 88w but only 107 (stock clocks) thats nice power..

[09/24/2021 6:03 PM] SnowPea#7485
As soon as it hits 48c,  hashrate drop, and if it gets cooler like 43c or so, hashrate drops to ~60 and will never come back up until it gets about 49c


[09/24/2021 6:04 PM] geezar#8187
nuts more likely to be thermal throttling but that looks low


[09/24/2021 6:05 PM] SnowPea#7485
Its a brand new card, only been mining for a week or so


[09/24/2021 6:05 PM] geezar#8187
85-90c usually and the core will drop dramatically - as we know LHR is a pain... should not occur that low tho - strange man!


[09/24/2021 6:06 PM] geezar#8187
if it was me I would drop that locked core some "just under max hash" and see if it keeps happening


[09/24/2021 6:06 PM] geezar#8187
afk


[09/24/2021 6:07 PM] SnowPea#7485
Ic, that is indeed very strange, but i never get any rejected share from the 60 and 60ti lhr, only from the non lhr 60ti, thats what Ive been tryimg to fix


[09/24/2021 6:07 PM] SnowPea#7485
I tried, anything lower or higher than 1280 the hashrate will drop to 10x


[09/24/2021 6:10 PM] SnowPea#7485
And i just tried lowering the mem clock to 1300, lhr kicks in even at 55c


[09/24/2021 6:12 PM] geezar#8187
nuts 0 out of interest running stock with just a lower PL does it still trigger?


[09/24/2021 6:15 PM] SnowPea#7485
I didnt set the PL now that i locked the core clock, but as i remembered i had the PL at 55% (lowest in msi afterburner) before and it didnt trigger, only the core clock is below or above 1280~1282 or the temp is lower than 48c


[09/24/2021 6:16 PM] SnowPea#7485
Just tuned up the core clock for my Tis and looks like its working

i take no credit ... taken directly from the old Ethos Distro OS (which still works for my older rigs) was very helpful back in the day.


[09/24/2021 7:47 PM] geezar#8187
All good, many new to mining will benefit from that üëç


[09/24/2021 7:53 PM] miner29#2975
The top line of his screen pic seems CPU#4 thread is locking up.... wonder what cpu he has in board?


[09/24/2021 7:59 PM] apexpool#3878
I3


[09/24/2021 8:01 PM] miner29#2975
which i3?


[09/24/2021 8:03 PM] apexpool#3878
8 √ó Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-10100F CPU @ 3.60GHz AES


[09/24/2021 8:04 PM] apexpool#3878
after "optimizing" bios settings it's not booting anymore, I have to reset it.


[09/24/2021 8:06 PM] miner29#2975
are you using the m.2 for any drives?  looking at lanes cpu has 16 lanes  trying to find if manual shows how they are spent


[09/24/2021 8:09 PM] miner29#2975
manual shows PCIEX_16-1 as 16x and PCIEX_16-2 as 4x


[09/24/2021 8:10 PM] miner29#2975
Are cards on risers?  Assume PCIEX_1-1 ~ 1-4 are but are the long slots also on risers...if not try them on risers which will force pcie x1 lanes on those slots


[09/24/2021 8:10 PM] apexpool#3878
I only have a USB stick for hiveOS

üëç 

[09/24/2021 8:10 PM] apexpool#3878
all 6 slots have risers


[09/24/2021 8:11 PM] miner29#2975
if you remove 1 card does it work / behave?


[09/24/2021 8:11 PM] apexpool#3878
that's what I'll do next... after I make it boot again. I reset the bios and set less options, but still not booting / no video. but it beeps once.


[09/24/2021 8:14 PM] miner29#2975
may have to drop back to single card to get boot then add one at a time until pop.  Found in manual x16 on primary slot is from cpu....the other 5 slots are from z490 chipset...only thing funny there is the bifutrication mode for the second long slot for raid card...dont want that on.


[09/24/2021 8:14 PM] andee#4722
looks like gpu/driver crash is flooding cpu with interrupts


[09/24/2021 8:16 PM] miner29#2975
ya first line is where trouble starts on that screen shot


[09/24/2021 8:29 PM] miner29#2975
@apexpool if you need you can borrow my üî® of rig fixin.....violence is never the answer....except when it is

I am not violent with my investment :)


[09/24/2021 8:30 PM] apexpool#3878
It seems CSM is what he does not like


[09/24/2021 8:37 PM] SnowPea#7485
Does anyone know if gpu risers (say 4 cap vs 8 cap) could possibly affect hashrate?


[09/24/2021 8:39 PM] andee#4722
the gpu already has the caps it needs. I don't know what they are there for, it might be for the 3.3V regulator


[09/24/2021 8:41 PM] SnowPea#7485
So it doesnt matter if i use a $6 riser vs a $12 one in terms of performance?


[09/24/2021 8:43 PM] miner29#2975
wont make a difference...its either work or no work...there is no try


[09/24/2021 8:43 PM] miner29#2975
(weres the yoda emoticon)


[09/24/2021 8:43 PM] SnowPea#7485
Got it, thanks


[09/24/2021 8:44 PM] miner29#2975
but get them with pcie6 power plug...the sata direct are NFG


[09/24/2021 8:46 PM] SnowPea#7485
Yes, powering all risers with pcie :)


[09/24/2021 9:09 PM] CheeseEatingBrit#6845
i'm getting about 80-90 with occasional jumps up to 105-ish at 115W


[09/24/2021 9:09 PM] CheeseEatingBrit#6845
tried playing around with several of the different afterburner settings on the google doc but none really improve it above that


[09/24/2021 9:32 PM] Herk#6019
always CSM


[09/24/2021 9:33 PM] Herk#6019
it's pretty much csm since I feel like 4g decoding is already enabled on most recent bios versions


[09/24/2021 9:33 PM] Herk#6019
what board do you have with that i3?


[09/24/2021 9:33 PM] apexpool#3878
Asus Prime Z490-P


[09/24/2021 9:34 PM] Herk#6019
ah right, thought you mentioned that the other day


[09/24/2021 9:34 PM] apexpool#3878
yes.


[09/24/2021 9:34 PM] apexpool#3878
and 4G decoding is enabled by default


[09/24/2021 9:34 PM] Herk#6019
üëç


[09/24/2021 9:34 PM] apexpool#3878

[09/24/2021 9:34 PM] Herk#6019
CSM disabled


[09/24/2021 9:34 PM] apexpool#3878
now testing with the 2 Vega cards


[09/24/2021 9:34 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, CSM disabled, because otherwise it does not start.


[09/24/2021 9:35 PM] Herk#6019
yep


[09/24/2021 9:35 PM] apexpool#3878
it crashed a few times because of the new Vega (Asus Rog Strix), but not it seems stable


[09/24/2021 9:35 PM] Herk#6019
so it's not bios settings


[09/24/2021 9:35 PM] Herk#6019
just read up now


[09/24/2021 9:36 PM] apexpool#3878
this card does not like higher memory clock. running stable with 877.


[09/24/2021 9:36 PM] apexpool#3878
the Sapphire Pulse likes 960.


[09/24/2021 9:36 PM] geezar#8187
Hynix I used to run 930 or so, sometimes higher but many do not like it


[09/24/2021 9:37 PM] geezar#8187
If it was me I would disconnect all GPU's and get the board to boot into the OS and start adding 1 at a time


[09/24/2021 9:37 PM] geezar#8187
playing catch-up but assume it boots


[09/24/2021 9:37 PM] Herk#6019
it's definitely the OC on the new card, he's been running the rig for a while


[09/24/2021 9:37 PM] geezar#8187
800 is default and 900 is usually the limit, I've had them at 960 but seldom


[09/24/2021 9:37 PM] Herk#6019
no amd's here though so


[09/24/2021 9:37 PM] Herk#6019
:shrug:


[09/24/2021 9:38 PM] geezar#8187
56 800-900 range on Hynix is good - higher, not so much


[09/24/2021 9:38 PM] apexpool#3878
the Sapphire Pulse likes 960, that is for sure.


[09/24/2021 9:38 PM] apexpool#3878
Samsung


[09/24/2021 9:38 PM] geezar#8187
yep some do, some do not


[09/24/2021 9:38 PM] geezar#8187
Hynix remember


[09/24/2021 9:38 PM] geezar#8187
56's on Samsung I've ran 1040+


[09/24/2021 9:39 PM] apexpool#3878
now increasing the core clock...


[09/24/2021 9:39 PM] geezar#8187
if it was me I would get the rig stable on safe clocks - all GPU's up and available and take things from there just my view


[09/24/2021 9:41 PM] apexpool#3878
I'm trying to find the settings for the new card, then I'll add the NVidia cards one by one.

[09/24/2021 9:41 PM] apexpool#3878
strange, the new card has better hashrate now, even if the mem clock is lower


[09/24/2021 9:42 PM] geezar#8187
847 SOC and mem is a good place to be


[09/24/2021 9:42 PM] apexpool#3878
SOC is 960, I did not touch it

[09/24/2021 9:43 PM] geezar#8187
Many straps out there - not sure what Hive offers, I go for the lower end on the Vegas - which ones are there for Hynix?


[09/24/2021 9:44 PM] apexpool#3878
I don't know where I could change the SocMHz


[09/24/2021 9:45 PM] geezar#8187
Don't have hive - Hynix are nice, not fully stable but held 725mv-731mv


[09/24/2021 9:45 PM] SnowPea#7485
Have you try downloading the new trex miner? it seems pretty good with core lock


[09/24/2021 9:46 PM] geezar#8187
Vega tuning lots of pinned and ton of experience over on TRM Discord  Apex - learned a lot from the dudes over there especially some of the older posts - lots of straps shared too üëç


[09/24/2021 9:47 PM] geezar#8187
From my testing too - from base the reported numbers on Vegas I need to add 40-45w on top of reported


[09/24/2021 9:48 PM] geezar#8187
To see the true usage - so that 121w will in reality be closer to 166w in case your working out your tolerances on the PSU


[09/24/2021 9:51 PM] SnowPea#7485
Im gettimg 129mh with 111w power, i have hynix memory, if you have the same memory, try these settings in trex, 25 core clock, lock core clock at 1365 and mem clock 980


[09/24/2021 9:53 PM] SnowPea#7485
@geezar my rig just restarted after running for almost 4 hrs, i didnt catch the error msg, but i guess it went blue screen and then restarted itself, i had the monitor turned off all these time

{Reactions}
üëç 

[09/24/2021 9:55 PM] SnowPea#7485
Everything seems to be running fine after the restart tho, trex fired up automatically and the numbers are still stable. There were 2 rejected shares when i pushed the 3060ti lhr, but no more rejected share after i tuned it back down


[09/24/2021 9:58 PM] apexpool#3878
I saw that 107w is actually about 165w on the wall.
Now I'm trying to find some stable settings, and then add the other cards one by one.


[09/24/2021 9:59 PM] apexpool#3878
it seems I found them.


[09/24/2021 9:59 PM] apexpool#3878
I will try to improve later.


[09/24/2021 9:59 PM] CheeseEatingBrit#6845
i've got samsung, though i switched to t-rex during testing yesterday and got +20-30 mhs over NBMiner. not seeing any difference with LHR mode though


[09/24/2021 10:08 PM] SnowPea#7485
So you're able to get around 120mh in trex?


[09/24/2021 10:08 PM] SnowPea#7485
Trex doesnt have lhr mode


[09/24/2021 10:12 PM] CheeseEatingBrit#6845
the 80-90 is with trex, i was getting 60-70 with NB


[09/24/2021 10:12 PM] CheeseEatingBrit#6845
and i meant the "--lhr-tune" command line for trex


[09/24/2021 10:15 PM] SnowPea#7485
I think that only works for eth, whats your core, mem and temp? from what i see, lhr kicked in


[09/24/2021 10:17 PM] CheeseEatingBrit#6845

tried -400 and up on the core but not much difference


[09/24/2021 10:18 PM] SnowPea#7485
Try open up curve edit and local the dot where the y-axis is 1365


[09/24/2021 10:18 PM] SnowPea#7485
Then press L, oh also set the PL to 65 for now


[09/24/2021 10:22 PM] CheeseEatingBrit#6845
750 mV, it has been locked


[09/24/2021 10:22 PM] SnowPea#7485
Whats the hashrate and power?


[09/24/2021 10:25 PM] CheeseEatingBrit#6845
down to about 75-85 mh, power down from 115W to 89W or so


[09/24/2021 10:27 PM] SnowPea#7485
Ok, now try to increase the mem clock to 900


[09/24/2021 10:29 PM] SnowPea#7485
And then try to lock the mV at somewhere between 750 to 800 and then adjust the core clock so that the dot stays at 1365


[09/24/2021 10:34 PM] CheeseEatingBrit#6845
hashrate is still high 80s, but the power fluctuates every other log, from ~95 to ~120


[09/24/2021 10:34 PM] CheeseEatingBrit#6845

[09/24/2021 10:36 PM] SnowPea#7485
Yea, you just need to work your mV up one point at a time while keeping the y-axis at 1365 to try to get to the sweet spot


[09/24/2021 10:37 PM] SnowPea#7485
If you get to like 850mV and still didnt change, then go back to 750mV, but this time lock the y-axis to 1350


[09/24/2021 10:38 PM] SnowPea#7485
At some point you should at least get over 110mh


[09/24/2021 10:38 PM] CheeseEatingBrit#6845
üëç cheers mate, very new to this


[09/24/2021 10:43 PM] SnowPea#7485
Good luck, i just started this less than 2 months too lol and i just literally figure out how to use the curve editor last night


[09/24/2021 10:46 PM] CheeseEatingBrit#6845
should i be keeping the mem / fan settings the same while im tinkering with the curve?


[09/24/2021 10:55 PM] SnowPea#7485
You can set the fan at 70 or so, as long as the temp stays between 50 to 60, thats good, lhr will kick in if temp is too low in some cases


[09/24/2021 10:56 PM] SnowPea#7485
As for mem, you can keep it at 900 for now until you found the mV and core clock that will push the hashrate to over 110, then you can start working on the mem clock


[09/24/2021 10:58 PM] SnowPea#7485
Different card is different, especially your card is not hynix memory, so the core clock may be different than mine, mine only works at 1350~1365, lhr kicks in too low or too high


[09/24/2021 11:34 PM] geezar#8187
good luck - monster rig you got there


[09/24/2021 11:36 PM] geezar#8187
@SnowPea after the crash is there not a T-Rex log file - it would tell you perhaps the reason for the crash or windows log/event log - Windows is a hassle with Linux worth considering


[09/24/2021 11:52 PM] SnowPea#7485
I dont see any log file for trex, and i dont know how to find window log file. Whats worse was that the rig would run find without me touching it, but when i tried to launch msi afterburner (i no longer use it now that im using the config file instead) it went blue screen and restarted again


[09/24/2021 11:52 PM] SnowPea#7485
Its been 1.5 hr since then and i didnt touch the rig again after the last restart, just monitoring it remotely, everything seems working fine


[09/24/2021 11:59 PM] geezar#8187
News to me over on #‚õè‚îÇmining Hynix 3060's on the market... hopefully we'll see some clocks on the google sheet as expect more of these I guess

@geezar just got another blue screen, do you think OC would be causing it?

Where did u get those 56s from


[09/25/2021 1:52 AM] SnowPea#7485
I think i found the problem. I set the fan to be based on core temp 53c, but after a while, the miner would throw an error saying that it couldnt do auto fan because core temp was not available, then the system will get a blue screen...i just tried setting the fan to 65% instead to see if it helps

nice work @apexpool


[09/25/2021 8:10 AM] geezar#8187
settled finally for 140w on the 70ti myself but much lower hash 173 but solid (seen anything up to 155w to get it close to 180 MH/s but happy for the moment!


[09/25/2021 8:11 AM] geezar#8187
1500 core and 2600 mem - I saw zero difference moving from that to 3400 - in fact lower hash lol - they all like different things it seems


[09/25/2021 8:13 AM] geezar#8187
Consider using a Linux OS for mining, a dedicated OS will take a LOT of hassle out of mining - most have free use and with much content online and discords not hard to setup - scenario is a productivity/gaming rig when in windows, reboot into USB and manage the rig from a mobile device - often much more stable - windows can* be made more resilient but many more factors at play IMO to keep it running 'well' maybe consider looking at some of them, many use Hive but others out there too


[09/25/2021 8:14 AM] geezar#8187
Interesting when you factor in the hash power v price - to achieve such hash with a much newer GPU would cost a lot more Euro's to achieve the same ... arguably the residuals and demand for the newer GPU is the longer play but as of 'now' the Vega is hard to beat for sure


[09/25/2021 8:17 AM] geezar#8187
damn impressive - what core clock are you locking to?


[09/25/2021 8:41 AM] apexpool#3878
same as before


[09/25/2021 8:41 AM] apexpool#3878
now I have a problem with the heat


[09/25/2021 11:09 AM] apexpool#3878
Thanks for the help, @miner29 
The rig is running now pretty stable. I had to arrange the cards in a specific order to make them stay at a good temperature, but in the end I have now over 1 GH/s with 6 cards for 935w.


[09/25/2021 11:11 AM] apexpool#3878
935w real power on the wall.


[09/25/2021 11:13 AM] apexpool#3878
I had to put some aluminium foils as a temporary solution to deflect the hot air blown by the 3070Ti cards, so that the next card can have a lower temperature and run with a lower fan rpm. So far is has very good results, I have to think about a better and permanent solution for that...

Hey miners boys, every 10mn the GPU fans up to 100% for no reason (temperature is correct, not overclocked) and decrease rapidly to a normal speed. Any idea ? (NBminer 39.4)


[09/25/2021 2:46 PM] geezar#8187
Heat with rigs is always a concern, especially clocking them for the higher power levels - a small grow tent could be the answer depending on your ultimate goals and potential to increase your farm


[09/25/2021 4:51 PM] SnowPea#7485
Guys i need some help


[09/25/2021 4:52 PM] SnowPea#7485
My rig kept crashing yesterday even if i reinstall windows 10, so i moved to hiveos


[09/25/2021 4:52 PM] SnowPea#7485
Then it starts mining a bit and the 3060 would throw an error

run it at stock clocks with only power limit first


[09/25/2021 4:57 PM] SnowPea#7485
Let me try


[09/25/2021 4:57 PM] SnowPea#7485

[09/25/2021 5:00 PM] SnowPea#7485

[09/25/2021 5:15 PM] SnowPea#7485
With stock clock and only power limit


[09/25/2021 5:18 PM] geezar#8187
I had to RMA a 1660s once - 2 weeks old, then again abused GPU's for years and never had issues - if you have constant problems could be an option (even at stock clocks and still seeing issues) - if using it to power a display worth checking for any visual problems with the output too


[09/25/2021 5:19 PM] SnowPea#7485
Maybe i pushed it too much at 117 with 90w


[09/25/2021 5:19 PM] SnowPea#7485

[09/25/2021 5:20 PM] geezar#8187

It ran for a bit longer then same thing

[09/25/2021 5:21 PM] SnowPea#7485
It said err here and the temp and hashrate disappeared


[09/25/2021 5:23 PM] SnowPea#7485
Im going to install a fresh window and start everything fresh again


[09/25/2021 5:23 PM] SnowPea#7485
If that happens again, im gonna rma it


[09/25/2021 5:50 PM] geezar#8187
If windows - just keep things simple @SnowPea - DDU Drivers, install a known good version you've had good hash with and even try using the Windows version of the miner as a stand-alone test. If its T-Rex install it and spin up with just that GPU selected (--devices / -d 0 or whatever) RMA can and does take a while unless the store will honour the deal and simply return you $$$ or replacement. Also RMA will only trigger if there is a problem. For example if the GPU powers up, displays on each of the ports and generally is not overheating/working as expected... they will not RMA - they will clearly not be RMA ing based on poor mining performance - total hassle but strip things back to bare bones - boot up windows using that GPU to power a display - determine if any defects/errors in the display output etc././. could save you some hassle / rejected RMA


[09/25/2021 5:51 PM] geezar#8187
Still messing with a 70ti - basically 150w (reported)

[09/25/2021 5:52 PM] geezar#8187
so on the basis of that 10w is the 5-6 MH/s worth it... ü§î


[09/25/2021 6:13 PM] apexpool#3878
if you click on that error messages, what message do you see?


[09/25/2021 6:14 PM] apexpool#3878
same message appears when you try to set the power limit outside of the allowed range


[09/25/2021 6:14 PM] apexpool#3878
and that's not a problem with the card.


[09/25/2021 6:14 PM] apexpool#3878
most likely your OC settings are causing the problem.


[09/25/2021 6:32 PM] SnowPea#7485
Im doing a fresh window install


[09/25/2021 6:33 PM] SnowPea#7485
I just reinstalled window, will report back in a bit


[09/25/2021 6:34 PM] apexpool#3878
that's only on hiveos


[09/25/2021 6:34 PM] apexpool#3878
you can install hiveos on a 8 GB usb stick, that's what I do.


[09/25/2021 6:46 PM] alyjay#6176
im trying to see which pool i should mine i have a 3080 LHR


[09/25/2021 7:00 PM] SnowPea#7485
Just finished installing everything, running trex now, will report back if crashes


[09/25/2021 7:01 PM] SnowPea#7485
Last night it ran for 7 hrs then it crashed


[09/25/2021 7:02 PM] SnowPea#7485
Hope it'll work this time


[09/25/2021 7:02 PM] miner29#2975
whatever ritual you must perform to get it to mine and be stable.  i tend to use phases of the moon and which side of the equator im on to start with then move up to holding my tongue right‚Ä¶what ever it takes ü§£üëç


[09/25/2021 7:04 PM] apexpool#3878
It's stable now, already 8h 40min uptime, mining just above 1 GH/s


[09/25/2021 7:06 PM] SnowPea#7485
@geezar @apexpool if the card crashes again, do you suggest doing a rma or anything else such as reflashing the bios?


[09/25/2021 7:07 PM] apexpool#3878
I would try to lower the OC settings


[09/25/2021 7:07 PM] SnowPea#7485
It crashed in hive with stock clock


[09/25/2021 7:07 PM] apexpool#3878
I thought my second Vega received yesterday was not OK, but I found the right settings


[09/25/2021 7:08 PM] apexpool#3878
lower the power limit


[09/25/2021 7:08 PM] SnowPea#7485
Ok, the it just crashes


[09/25/2021 7:08 PM] apexpool#3878
also on windows?


[09/25/2021 7:08 PM] SnowPea#7485
Yes


[09/25/2021 7:08 PM] SnowPea#7485
Blue screen, restarted


[09/25/2021 7:09 PM] apexpool#3878
try to play a game


[09/25/2021 7:09 PM] apexpool#3878
or it crashes without mining, too?


[09/25/2021 7:09 PM] SnowPea#7485
I dont have any games on my rig lol


[09/25/2021 7:10 PM] SnowPea#7485
How about play a video?


[09/25/2021 7:10 PM] apexpool#3878
try that


[09/25/2021 7:10 PM] apexpool#3878
I thought it's a normal PC, since you install Windows üòÇ


[09/25/2021 7:11 PM] SnowPea#7485
It was a normal pc, but now that i just reinstalled windows, nothing is on it


[09/25/2021 7:11 PM] SnowPea#7485
Let me try to do a benchmark test


[09/25/2021 7:18 PM] Kulo29#1657
Hi, I can't seem to get my 3060 mining erg using any miner on hive os. Works fine for eth, but won't start the miner for ergo. Why?


[09/25/2021 7:38 PM] SnowPea#7485
@apexpool just tried watching a video, its fine, vmem test was fine, but when i started a miner, the card will just "turn off" after a few minutes


[09/25/2021 7:39 PM] SnowPea#7485
Seems like i broke the card...


[09/25/2021 7:39 PM] apexpool#3878
temperature before crash?


[09/25/2021 7:39 PM] SnowPea#7485
51


[09/25/2021 7:40 PM] SnowPea#7485
I plugged the monitor to the card, the display just turned off


[09/25/2021 7:40 PM] SnowPea#7485
But the cards are still running


[09/25/2021 7:40 PM] apexpool#3878
reset it


[09/25/2021 7:41 PM] apexpool#3878
try t-rex with core lock 1500 and power limit 56% or about that. it's 3060 the card?


[09/25/2021 7:42 PM] SnowPea#7485
I need to go out now, will try again tonight, thanks!

[09/25/2021 7:58 PM] geezar#8187
@SnowPea key is if you are going to RMA it - confirm the GPU is not working - if its not hashing 'well' that is not rationale for a RMA to be a success. Get it working/prove it outputs to a display without artefacts etc - the RMA will just be a boomerang and come back to you unless you confirm its proven to be faulty


[09/25/2021 7:59 PM] geezar#8187
Mining on any GPU attached to a display too IMO not a great move - good luck


[09/25/2021 8:07 PM] SnowPea#7485
Thanks, my mb doesnt have an onboard display, so i had to attach one to a monitor, but i used to connect to the 3060ti lhr, never used this 3060 as display


[09/25/2021 8:07 PM] SnowPea#7485
I may download a game just try to play it to see if the display will turn off


[09/25/2021 8:07 PM] SnowPea#7485
But probably gotta do it tomorrow, i'll be out all day today


[09/25/2021 8:08 PM] SnowPea#7485
Also, im going to try switching to a new riser, maybe a bad riser could cause this? i dont know...


[09/25/2021 8:39 PM] geezar#8187
As the guys have suggested anything intensive/demanding on the GPU HD content etc - anything to make it fail basically


[09/25/2021 9:37 PM] apexpool#3878
I have a question about powering the risers...


[09/25/2021 9:37 PM] apexpool#3878
can a cable like this one

[09/25/2021 9:38 PM] apexpool#3878
because the risers have 2 x 6-pin connectors


[09/25/2021 9:38 PM] apexpool#3878
and the second one is powered by the first one.


[09/25/2021 9:40 PM] Herk#6019
yes


[09/25/2021 9:40 PM] Herk#6019
but it doesn't mean you should


[09/25/2021 9:41 PM] Herk#6019
it all depends on the total power usage (for the card/s)

[09/25/2021 9:42 PM] apexpool#3878
I don't have enough 6-pin connectors for all my risers, and I am using also molex for a few. and I think this might be actually better than using the molex.


[09/25/2021 9:42 PM] Herk#6019
the picture above is a good one to base your math on


[09/25/2021 9:42 PM] Herk#6019
and combine those numbers with the 80% rule


[09/25/2021 9:42 PM] Herk#6019
to avoid problems


[09/25/2021 9:43 PM] apexpool#3878
216w is much better than 54w a molex can provide...


[09/25/2021 9:43 PM] Herk#6019
molex can provide a lot more, the problem with molex is that there is no standard


[09/25/2021 9:43 PM] Herk#6019
so you never know


[09/25/2021 9:43 PM] gnuion#3794
Hello guys, have you tried a AMD Radeon Vega Frontier Edition?


[09/25/2021 9:43 PM] Herk#6019
so yes, you're better off avoiding it


[09/25/2021 9:44 PM] gnuion#3794
you mean the AMD Radeon Vega Frontier Edition?


[09/25/2021 9:44 PM] apexpool#3878
no, what I asked


[09/25/2021 9:45 PM] gnuion#3794
Okay, I got a deal for AMD Radeon Vega Frontier Edition for 550Euros. It has 16GB of RAM. It looks between vega 56 and 64 performancewise in gpu benchamark.


[09/25/2021 9:46 PM] gnuion#3794
But I am not sure how modding goes as how much hashrate I can get for how much power...


[09/25/2021 9:46 PM] apexpool#3878
there are 2 in the spreadsheet and they seem to be fine for mining ergo


[09/25/2021 9:46 PM] apexpool#3878
or maybe too hungry...


[09/25/2021 9:48 PM] gnuion#3794
Maybe there can be found nice settings as with other vegas....


[09/25/2021 9:48 PM] gnuion#3794
I wonder how modding goes...


[09/25/2021 9:52 PM] gnuion#3794
I will download original bios and try to mod with one click... RAM is different though HBM2


[09/25/2021 9:55 PM] gnuion#3794
saw this on the forum. not so great

[09/25/2021 10:21 PM] geezar#8187
@gnuion there is no one click bios mod for the vega. Your best path is to use the straps (amdtweaktool) in windows or now native in many of the Linux mining O/S.


[09/25/2021 10:22 PM] geezar#8187
TRM discord a good path to follow


[09/25/2021 10:24 PM] gnuion#3794
Okay, I see Vega FE specs slightly better than vega64 on paper, however it's a rare card and It's harder to find community support...


[09/25/2021 10:25 PM] BreadTheGood#3277
i just started mining ergo but i dont get accepted shares often. here its cmd after 10 mins and 0 shares but ive tried by hours and only got around 30 shares

[09/26/2021 11:21 AM] geezar#8187
166w per GPU then less whatever draw the Mobo etc is pulling so realistically in the 150w range per GPU I guess right?


[09/26/2021 5:35 PM] SnowPea#7485
Hi guys, just want to report back, i swapped out a new riser and let the 3060 ran in lhr mode (below 48c) the whole night (about 10hrs) and it didnt crash, im going to try to oc it again and hope it'll work


[09/26/2021 8:00 PM] geezar#8187
Thing is... that GPU would in realty be driven very hard in games and other applications... no way that 48c is by design - I‚Äôve seen errors 80c+ on V1‚Äôs but only testing silly high mem clocks (2900 and 127 MH/s but not stable)


[09/26/2021 8:01 PM] geezar#8187
You could crack it open but that could void your warranty to check paste/pads... if it was me I think I would consider a replacement worse case


[09/26/2021 8:14 PM] SnowPea#7485
I think its a bad riser, i just tried tuning down the fan to 55%, the hashrate went right up to 117 at 51c and it went all the up to 58c and still working fine


[09/26/2021 8:14 PM] SnowPea#7485
I didnt try to push it to 60c, but i just left the fan at 60% and now the temp stays around 55c and its been up for 2hrs after my last restart


[09/26/2021 8:15 PM] apexpool#3878
try 56-57c


[09/26/2021 8:15 PM] apexpool#3878
that's the sweet spot for my 3660ti card


[09/26/2021 8:16 PM] SnowPea#7485
It works fine at 57c too, when i had the old riser, it would crash when its over 56c

[09/26/2021 8:18 PM] SnowPea#7485
Ive contacted the seller, they said i had to return the whole bundle (gpu, a psu, a mouse and a 3 months xbox gamepass) altogether even if i just want a replacement for the card


[09/26/2021 8:20 PM] apexpool#3878
I believe the card is ok, if it was stable for 2 hours.


[09/26/2021 8:22 PM] SnowPea#7485
It ran at lhr mode for 10hrs since last night without crashing, then i tuned up the oc this morning to get it back to 117mh and ran for 2 hrs, so it ran about 12hrs straight without crashing now


[09/26/2021 8:22 PM] SnowPea#7485
Thank God its a bad riser


[09/26/2021 8:25 PM] SnowPea#7485
Anyhow, thank you @apexpool and @geezar , you guys been a great help!


[09/26/2021 8:27 PM] apexpool#3878
you are welcome, I didn't do much


[09/26/2021 8:28 PM] SnowPea#7485
It meant a lot to me already :)  btw, if you are mining on windows, how do you monitor the rig when you are outside of the network?


[09/26/2021 8:30 PM] apexpool#3878
hiveos here. and linux on the laptop I'm writing from.


[09/26/2021 8:30 PM] apexpool#3878
I'm not a windows user.


[09/26/2021 8:32 PM] SnowPea#7485
Ok, thats okay, i'll do some more research


[09/26/2021 8:32 PM] SnowPea#7485
I tried hiveos, but the oc setting was so different from windows, the same oc just wont get the same result

true


[09/26/2021 8:39 PM] SnowPea#7485

[09/26/2021 9:31 PM] Wii#9265

70%


[09/26/2021 9:31 PM] apexpool#3878
my 3060ti does 137 MH/s. I saw more than 150 MH/s whan it starts, then LHR kick in.

I‚Äôm confused, please excuse me


[09/26/2021 9:32 PM] apexpool#3878
it says it has lhr unlock, but it performs similar to t-rex


[09/26/2021 9:32 PM] apexpool#3878
which does not claim that.


[09/26/2021 9:33 PM] Wii#9265

[09/26/2021 9:33 PM] Wii#9265
I‚Äôm on trex anyway


[09/26/2021 9:33 PM] apexpool#3878
nbminer will display that lhr kicked in and decrease the lhr limit


[09/26/2021 9:33 PM] apexpool#3878
but the best result will be similar to t-rex or a little worse.


[09/26/2021 9:34 PM] apexpool#3878
at least for the few people that tested yesterday and today and wrote here about the results.

Ouch, thats worse than california here


[09/26/2021 9:36 PM] apexpool#3878
California is the most expensive?


[09/26/2021 9:37 PM] SnowPea#7485
Im on a time of use rate, 45 cents between 4pm to 9pm, 18 cents all other hours


[09/26/2021 9:37 PM] SnowPea#7485
I dont know where is the most expensive but i know california is not cheap


[09/26/2021 9:40 PM] apexpool#3878
for sure not, I heard other people saying they have around $0.10


[09/26/2021 9:40 PM] apexpool#3878
10 cents for 1 KW/h


[09/26/2021 9:40 PM] apexpool#3878
so cheap


[09/26/2021 9:41 PM] Wii#9265
I think it‚Äôs like 8 cents in Serbia (my mother‚Äôs home country)

(Yes I came back, I cannot sleep‚Ä¶)


[09/26/2021 9:43 PM] SnowPea#7485
Yea, heard ppl saying that too, i work for the utility company so i get 25% off of electricity, but still, its about $190 for me a month and I only have 3 cards


[09/26/2021 9:44 PM] SnowPea#7485
Well, to be fair, the cards use about $70~75 a month, but i still need to keep my ac on a lot more often now


[09/26/2021 9:45 PM] Wii#9265
I just keep my window open to cool the room with my computer  (Swedish summer)


[09/26/2021 9:45 PM] SnowPea#7485
Its like 105F here in summer lol

[09/26/2021 9:47 PM] Wii#9265
Yea if you count -2 degrees celsius


[09/26/2021 9:47 PM] Wii#9265
(31 F or somethin)


[09/26/2021 9:48 PM] apexpool#3878
that's not cold.

(73 F)


[09/26/2021 9:50 PM] SnowPea#7485
Thats not too cold, california would get to low 40f in winter, but its so hot in summer


[09/26/2021 9:51 PM] SnowPea#7485
But we dont have much rain, which is nice, i dont like rain


[09/26/2021 9:51 PM] Wii#9265
Sadly there is like 1 snowy day in winter nowadays


[09/26/2021 9:51 PM] Wii#9265
5 years ago it was so much snow and maybe -10 celsius


[09/26/2021 9:58 PM] SnowPea#7485
I dont like snow, i mean i like to go up to the mountain to play snow and stuff, but i dont like snowy days


[09/26/2021 10:44 PM] andee#4722
there are people getting up to 145MH on 3060ti's, so it does something

Im a bit disappointed at this round of lhr unlock, hope it'll be better next round


[09/27/2021 1:37 AM] SnowPea#7485
I saw someone got his 3060ti to 145mh, but it used 125w power, with the same power, the non lhr 3060ti can do 170mh


[09/27/2021 1:40 AM] Elemental#9509
what non lhr 60ti settings?


[09/27/2021 1:41 AM] SnowPea#7485
Mine is -185 core, lock at 1365 core clock, 1350 mem clock, 170mh at 123~125w power


[09/27/2021 1:46 AM] McGrubber#6265
any settings for 3080 lhr ?


[09/27/2021 1:49 AM] SnowPea#7485
I only have 3060 and 3060ti


[09/27/2021 1:51 AM] MasterG#9359
Hello everyone!  Can someone please share their OC settings in Hive, for a 3080 LHR. Thanks!


[09/27/2021 1:52 AM] Elemental#9509
oh. forgot 60ti and 70 were different for non eth algos


[09/27/2021 1:54 AM] SnowPea#7485
Yea, the oc is probably different, but their performance are very similar


[09/27/2021 5:40 AM] apexpool#3878
they do that only with nbminer?


[09/27/2021 5:40 AM] apexpool#3878
I guess you found it


[09/27/2021 5:43 AM] SnowPea#7485
Yea, only nbminer for now, but i think other miners will be able to do it sooner or later


[09/27/2021 5:45 AM] apexpool#3878
I mean, they get 145 MH/s only with nbminer? I know that only nbminer has this option, but it seems it does not do much, only automatically updating the settings when lhr kicks in. if you have the right settings, you can get the same results without the lhr option, at least this is what it looks like.


[09/27/2021 5:47 AM] SnowPea#7485
I just saw someone got 140~144mh with only less than 110w, looks like ppl are figuring it out


[09/27/2021 5:50 AM] apexpool#3878
I am getting 137 with 100w with t-rex. this is the best one I've seen so far.

[09/27/2021 5:51 AM] apexpool#3878
it's usually around 136 MH/s.


[09/27/2021 5:51 AM] SnowPea#7485
I know, your number is epic


[09/27/2021 5:51 AM] SnowPea#7485
Im only getting 131mh with 111w


[09/27/2021 5:52 AM] apexpool#3878
100w for me, I corrected.


[09/27/2021 5:52 AM] apexpool#3878
I wrote 110w by mistake.


[09/27/2021 5:53 AM] SnowPea#7485
So nice


[09/27/2021 5:53 AM] apexpool#3878
at 101w LHR kicks already in. even at 100w if the temperature is lower than 55c


[09/27/2021 5:53 AM] apexpool#3878
and 100w is the minimum I can set


[09/27/2021 5:54 AM] SnowPea#7485
Thats very nice


[09/27/2021 7:33 AM] Ananas#9063
@apexpool i'd flash that gigabyte's bios on your other 3060tis if u have a lot of them

Whilst its the same GPU the low hashing Zotac I had - simply re-flashing the same BIOS I obtained from Techpowerup - gained 2-3 MH/s (same GPU but newer BIOS) remains problem free and hashing well


[09/27/2021 8:53 AM] andee#4722
maximum I have seen before this release is around the hashrate you get, but in the last days I have seen two that claim the -lhr hashes 145


[09/27/2021 8:55 AM] apexpool#3878
this is running with nbminer (started 5 minutes ago), with lhr 100 for 3070ti cards and 85 for 3060ti

so close to t-rex for 3070ti, but much worse for 3060ti

you 60ti guys seem to have a good option with NB -lhr 85, 70 and 80's does not seem (atm) to be any better with -LHR 100 but all needs testing, my personal testing only a short time and not validated shares on the pool etc TBF

[09/27/2021 9:02 AM] apexpool#3878
the 3060ti can do over 140 MH/s, but with a lot more power


[09/27/2021 9:03 AM] geezar#8187
117w is still good but agree


[09/27/2021 9:03 AM] apexpool#3878
I'll try now with core clock 1500 instead of -625


[09/27/2021 9:03 AM] Sam2Can#6957
That's what got the power down for me


[09/27/2021 9:03 AM] apexpool#3878

[09/27/2021 9:03 AM] geezar#8187
I've stopped using core lock now - offset only giving much better results


[09/27/2021 9:04 AM] apexpool#3878

I noticed starting at -lhr 100 - was stable then started to drop on auto but unless I see higher hash/lower power sticking with T for the moment

```[10:04:23] INFO - | 1|3060ti| 141.9 M|    29|     1|  0|  98|  54|    | 90|1500| 8100|  36| 1.448 M|
``` for a short time...


[09/27/2021 9:05 AM] Sam2Can#6957
Quite stable after 3 hours. But what on earth is going on with the different power. I have 3 GB Eagles and 3 GB OC Gaming. Each card is using a different amount of power.

85* is the basis for testing - TBH all GPU's will vary so makes sense to try auto - some may be 82, some 87

`When mining lock is detected during ERGO mining, miner will automatically decrease -lhr value by 0.5, and continue mining. max decrease times is 10, which sums to 5.0`


[09/27/2021 9:07 AM] geezar#8187
so if you set say 100 it will drop on auto until the lock does not occur


[09/27/2021 9:07 AM] apexpool#3878
now testing absolute values for 3070ti, too. 1770


[09/27/2021 9:07 AM] Sam2Can#6957
Yeh ok makes sense so set it to 95 and it will drop down as low as 90


[09/27/2021 9:08 AM] geezar#8187
My thoughts are too the core will vary/GPUs will all respond differently so keep that one as it is and mess with the others only (when applying the clocks do them individually) damn nice low power tho


[09/27/2021 9:08 AM] geezar#8187
dont have one to test but you 60ti owners have a pay day üôÇ

now ERG along with my FHR 3070's.


[09/27/2021 9:09 AM] geezar#8187
@Sam2Can 8100 is very low - what happens if you crank that up?


[09/27/2021 9:09 AM] geezar#8187
not very* but I know they will hold 2700/8150 - just curious


[09/27/2021 9:10 AM] geezar#8187
8650 on ERG does well on V1's


[09/27/2021 9:10 AM] Sam2Can#6957
When I was using TRex I had them on 2700 with a few rejects. When I tried 2700 on NBMiner LHR kept on kicking in.


[09/27/2021 9:10 AM] geezar#8187
yep some hold, some kick seems


[09/27/2021 9:11 AM] geezar#8187
either way damn nice - I would mess with that core/offsets further - wonder without the core lock what would happen


[09/27/2021 9:11 AM] apexpool#3878
it seems so far that for 3060ti nbminer is working better, but for 3070ti still t-rex has the best results.


[09/27/2021 9:12 AM] geezar#8187
agree with that


[09/27/2021 9:12 AM] Sam2Can#6957
It will be interesting to see what TRex comes up with for ERG and LRH.


[09/27/2021 9:12 AM] apexpool#3878
trying again -550 core cloch for 3070ti, 1770 and 1500 ar enot good


[09/27/2021 9:18 AM] apexpool#3878
still not good.


[09/27/2021 9:18 AM] apexpool#3878
now trying t-rex for 3070ti cards, nbminer for 3060ti and trm for Vega56.


[09/27/2021 9:18 AM] apexpool#3878
I guess this is the final setup for now


[09/27/2021 9:19 AM] Sam2Can#6957

[09/27/2021 9:21 AM] Sam2Can#6957
I checked these figures at the wall as well. A lot of the LHR unlocks so far for other algos have consumed way more power at the wall than reported in the software. In the case of NBminer 39.5 the software matches what the power draw is at the wall. So I'm pretty happy with that.


[09/27/2021 9:22 AM] Ananas#9063
inb4 i mess around with an lhr 3060 and it gets more hash with lhr unlock than the 3060 v1 KEKW


[09/27/2021 9:22 AM] geezar#8187
Good point - we're assuming at this point the T findings are consistent... gminer I think the reported power was way lower from some 80ti testing good idea @Sam2Can


[09/27/2021 9:23 AM] geezar#8187
so just because its reporting lower does not = actual (maybe) Apex best do that test back to back with the meter


[09/27/2021 9:23 AM] Herk#6019
do you also measure these at the wall?


[09/27/2021 9:23 AM] apexpool#3878
92 was temporary, it stays at 98 now


[09/27/2021 9:23 AM] Deleted User#0000

[09/27/2021 9:23 AM] geezar#8187
we need a back to back with both miners - same clocks and keep as many variables as consistent as possible - also shares at the pool... sadly this is 24/48 test needed 'really'


[09/27/2021 9:24 AM] geezar#8187
maybe a dedicated google sheet for the LHR 60ti lol


[09/27/2021 9:24 AM] apexpool#3878
yes. just as -625 did the trick for t-rex, 1500 does the trick for nbminer with lhr 85, it seems.

the 40 watt difference accounts for my system at idle

me too, the power decreased a few Watts at the wall


[09/27/2021 9:30 AM] apexpool#3878
I guess the AMD driver only counts the power from the extra 8-pin cables and not from the slot


[09/27/2021 9:30 AM] apexpool#3878
but NVidia counts all


[09/27/2021 9:30 AM] geezar#8187
interesting - we need actual pull at the wall however - dont rely on the applications even in windows - less the base mobo etc - non the less damn impressive so far if the numbers stack up


[09/27/2021 9:30 AM] Sam2Can#6957
There are YT videos that show either miner software or driver software are way off (reporting much lower) for ETH LHR unlocks in the past.


[09/27/2021 9:30 AM] apexpool#3878
otherwise I cannot explain the difference


[09/27/2021 9:30 AM] geezar#8187
agree - wall meter only proven evidience


[09/27/2021 9:31 AM] geezar#8187
for that to be accurate you need b2b and consistent testing for both miners/environment and all the other variables


[09/27/2021 9:31 AM] geezar#8187
damn if I had one I would run a single 60ti - same mobo - run the tests before/after using both of the miners

[09/27/2021 10:52 AM] geezar#8187
55-60 MH/s on this algo with --mt 4 I think did not generate too much heat even with the single Fan and fact they have been mining for years in a China farm - watch out for surface corrosion and DOA GPU's - most will have been re-pasted but testing* depends on the seller..


[09/27/2021 10:54 AM] Dv#3650
Interested in how they get 55-60 on ergo though


[09/27/2021 10:54 AM] geezar#8187
--mt was the key


[09/27/2021 10:55 AM] Dv#3650
I know they're not exactly the same as 1060 3gbs but I have 4 1060s running atm and the highest I've been able to get is 47 mhs with a card that has samsung mem

interestingly the non mining ones did much lower power lol


[09/27/2021 10:59 AM] geezar#8187
all miners have a readme - this is an example for NB..


[09/27/2021 10:59 AM] geezar#8187
`--mt, --memory-tweak <mode> Memory timings optimize for Nvidia GDDR5 & GDDR5X gpus. range [1-6]. Higher value equals higher hashrate. Individual value can be set via comma seperated list. Power limit may need to be tuned up to get more hashrate. Higher reject share ratio can happen if mining rig hits high temperature, set lower value of -mt can reduce reject ratio. Under windows, a custom driver need to be installed when using -mt, can installed manually by option --driver, or run nbminer.exe with admin privilege to perform auto-install. Under linux, admin priviledge is needed to run, sudo ./nbminer -mt x. OhGodAnETHlargementPill is not needed anymore if -mt is enabled when mining on 1080 & 1080ti GPUs.`


[09/27/2021 10:59 AM] geezar#8187
P106 was using GDDR5 hence flew using this option


[09/27/2021 11:00 AM] geezar#8187
Same as a 1070 - will run 50's but with --mt will soar to 70-80.

just add "--mt 3" into your string to test - all vary

different straps might make it better


[09/27/2021 11:01 AM] geezar#8187
depending if the miner supports it - NB/T-rex for sure

T-Rex
` --mt                       Memory tweak mode (default: 0 - disabled). Range from 0 to 6. General recommendation
                                   is to start with 1, and then increase only if the GPU is stable.
                                   The effect is similar to that of ETHlargementPill.
                                   Supported on Pascal GPUs with GDDR5 or GDDR5X memory only.
                                   Requires running the miner with administrative privileges.
                                   Can be set to a comma separated list to apply different values to different cards.
                                   Example: --mt 4 (applies tweak mode #4 to all cards that support this functionality)
                                            --mt 3,3,3,0 (applies tweak mode #3 to all cards except the last one)`


[09/27/2021 11:01 AM] Dv#3650

[09/27/2021 11:02 AM] geezar#8187

ETH for sure has seen a nice pump


[09/27/2021 1:00 PM] Dv#3650
lol I tried it, and I've spent the last 2 hours trying to revert it and get my rig to run stable


[09/27/2021 1:00 PM] Dv#3650
idk what the deal is but whenever I change anything it fucks up


[09/27/2021 1:01 PM] Dv#3650
even if I got back to the exact same settings as before


[09/27/2021 1:02 PM] geezar#8187
Start low with it - add the --mt 1 for example - if you do ALL GDDR5 GPU's will have it applied


[09/27/2021 1:03 PM] geezar#8187
for non compatible GPU's it will not make any difference


[09/27/2021 1:03 PM] geezar#8187
seems between --mt 3 - mt 5 seem best


[09/27/2021 1:04 PM] geezar#8187
I run --mt 6 on an older 10 series GPU - higher power usage but good for what it is TBH

try lhr 99 etc


[09/27/2021 2:20 PM] WhoDey#4382
I‚Äôm getting about 260 on my 3080ti ‚Ä¶ does NB allow even more? Or does it just fix cards with more aggressive LHR?

[09/27/2021 2:25 PM] Deathmumi#1369
you may drop your power usage

don' t sure if it can go more over 260mhs


[09/27/2021 2:25 PM] Deathmumi#1369
nb informs that v2 cards can get more hashes


[09/27/2021 2:26 PM] Deathmumi#1369
if you have 3080ti first release they already mine at max :=)


[09/27/2021 2:26 PM] Deathmumi#1369
you need to try yourself

[09/27/2021 2:46 PM] Sam2Can#6957
Is there any brand / model pattern to 3060ti LHR hynix memory based cards? Or is it pure luck.


[09/27/2021 2:47 PM] Sam2Can#6957
All Gigabytes I have are Samsung (3060ti / 3070's)

older driver gets more result on older releases

Someone pls tell me what has been working so for with the lhr mode on ergo and 3070tis


[09/27/2021 3:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
Made no difference to me but I think I‚Äôm doing it wrong


[09/27/2021 3:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
Not sure


[09/27/2021 3:47 PM] Deathmumi#1369
simple


[09/27/2021 3:47 PM] Deathmumi#1369
feature: ergo new LHR mode for mining ERGO, enable it by manually adding -lhr option

    Same as LHR mode in ethash, -lhr value represents expected hashrate to reach value percent of non-LHR GPU's hashrate, supports comma-seperated list to indicate -lhr value for each GPU, and -lhr -1 to disable.
    For GPUs with Hynix GDDR6 memory, LHR mode is not recommended for the poor performance.
    For GPUs with non-Hynix GDDR6 memory, e.g. 3060 3060ti 3070, start trying with -lhr 85
    For GPUs with GDDR6X memory, e.g. 3070ti 3080 3080ti, start trying with -lhr 100
    When mining lock is detected during ERGO mining, miner will automatically decrease -lhr value by 0.5, and continue mining. max decrease times is 10, which sums to 5.0

optimize: ergo Lower power consumption on Nvidia GPUs.


[09/27/2021 3:47 PM] Deathmumi#1369
if you are using hiveos make sure command type like these


[09/27/2021 3:48 PM] Deathmumi#1369
"lhr": "85,100,95,-1"


[09/27/2021 4:06 PM] apexpool#3878
it made no difference for me, too. actually t-rex has better results than nbminer with lhr 100 option.


[09/27/2021 4:06 PM] apexpool#3878
but it makes a difference for 3060ti with Samsung memory


[09/27/2021 4:07 PM] geezar#8187
Whats you efficiency Apex on the 60ti - thinking that must be the most efficient on this algo so far


[09/27/2021 4:07 PM] apexpool#3878
5 MH/s extra and 2w less


[09/27/2021 4:08 PM] apexpool#3878
it was 1.452 for a long time, then decreased to 1.442


[09/27/2021 4:08 PM] apexpool#3878
141.3 MH/s for 98w now


[09/27/2021 4:08 PM] geezar#8187
Not seen a gpu get close to that so far


[09/27/2021 4:08 PM] geezar#8187
60ti are flooding the market too


[09/27/2021 4:09 PM] apexpool#3878
I looked on ebay for other Gigabyte Eagle OC to see if I can get some


[09/27/2021 4:09 PM] geezar#8187
Wonder how the Hynix is doing using same approach


[09/27/2021 4:10 PM] apexpool#3878
probably will not work


[09/27/2021 4:10 PM] apexpool#3878
``` For GPUs with non-Hynix GDDR6 memory, e.g. 3060 3060ti 3070, start trying with -lhr 85```


[09/27/2021 4:10 PM] apexpool#3878
```For GPUs with Hynix GDDR6 memory, LHR mode is not recommended for the poor performance.```


[09/27/2021 4:11 PM] geezar#8187

174-175 and 258-261 vary but regardless


[09/27/2021 4:12 PM] apexpool#3878
one of my 3070 ti cards is a little better than the other two


[09/27/2021 4:13 PM] geezar#8187
NB and T-Rex report the same power at same clocks from my testing so seems legit - shares submitted to the pool have increased I wonder running that increase


[09/27/2021 4:13 PM] apexpool#3878
1.31 MH/W, the others 1.30 MH/W


[09/27/2021 4:13 PM] apexpool#3878
shares submitted have increased with nbminer?

Yeah I did, I messed with lhr and messed with OC


[09/27/2021 4:19 PM] Deathmumi#1369
if your lhr 100 not working try 95 then 90 or 85


[09/27/2021 4:19 PM] Deathmumi#1369
my 3060 working at lhr 98


[09/27/2021 4:19 PM] Deathmumi#1369
3060ti ones lhr 84


[09/27/2021 4:20 PM] Deathmumi#1369
generally fix coreclock around 1500-1600mhz


[09/27/2021 4:20 PM] Deathmumi#1369
mem depends how your oc goings


[09/27/2021 4:20 PM] apexpool#3878
Vega56 are very good, but they also need a lot of power.


[09/27/2021 4:20 PM] apexpool#3878
even if the driver is reporting low power, if you measure it, you will see that it is actually a lot more.


[09/27/2021 4:21 PM] Deathmumi#1369

[09/27/2021 4:26 PM] apexpool#3878
it can also do more if you push the memory clock


[09/27/2021 4:27 PM] Deathmumi#1369
for 3060tis pushing over 1300(2600) risking card lifespan

hynix have also low overclocking


[09/27/2021 4:28 PM] Deathmumi#1369

[09/27/2021 4:28 PM] Herk#6019
?!


[09/27/2021 4:29 PM] Deathmumi#1369
That means adding +1400mhz to your mem (linux 2800mhz)

this cause damage over time

but do you have something to back that up?


[09/27/2021 4:32 PM] Deathmumi#1369
overclocking so much damages your items not matter what was it


[09/27/2021 4:33 PM] Herk#6019
that shows if you overclock but your temp is in range you're actually doing damage to.. something


[09/27/2021 4:33 PM] geezar#8187
Gaming arguably does more damage they say - high/low constant irratic volrages and spikes - the average miner sets the clocks and leaves, usually keeping an eye on temps and not stressing them too hard


[09/27/2021 4:33 PM] Deathmumi#1369
back up for what _ ? i have burned some gpus in time doing extreme overclocking


[09/27/2021 4:33 PM] apexpool#3878

never because of OC


[09/27/2021 4:34 PM] geezar#8187
"waits patiently for Apex to hit 150 MH's using extreme OC...."


[09/27/2021 4:34 PM] Herk#6019
it was really the temp that killed it, caused by shitty cooling

[09/27/2021 4:35 PM] Deathmumi#1369
while gpu temps shows 60c on eth or autolykos it's also think that your memory works +15-20c more

max 15


[09/27/2021 4:36 PM] Deathmumi#1369
air condition not means you can push your card clock even normal overclock to +200 +300 +400 +500 more


[09/27/2021 4:36 PM] Deathmumi#1369
they have some limits each others


[09/27/2021 4:37 PM] Deathmumi#1369
in normal signal output you see artifact


[09/27/2021 4:37 PM] Deathmumi#1369
while computing it rejects


[09/27/2021 4:37 PM] Deathmumi#1369
if you see so much rejects while you mining that means some trouble on your card overclock

Cooling is important and air flow


[09/27/2021 4:40 PM] Deathmumi#1369
3000 series not like older cards they have more smaller die cast gpus and designed to work more lower temps safely

I have some FE's which really suck at cooling, a 120mm 2000rpm fan is all it took to drop 10C


[09/27/2021 4:41 PM] SnowPea#7485
Lol


[09/27/2021 4:41 PM] geezar#8187
lol


[09/27/2021 4:41 PM] Herk#6019
anyway, I think it's hard to kill an nvidia gpu on OC alone


[09/27/2021 4:42 PM] Herk#6019
if you keep it in a shoebox


[09/27/2021 4:42 PM] Herk#6019
and it stays constant on high temps, yes, it's a different story


[09/27/2021 4:42 PM] Deathmumi#1369
man i have rtx3070 in my hand which gaves 64,5mhs on eth but with rejects and card works 45c, did you understand what i mean ? üòÑ


[09/27/2021 4:42 PM] Herk#6019
or maybe you get creative and hack the vbios etc, sure


[09/27/2021 4:43 PM] Deathmumi#1369
even same card can bump up to 176mhs starts to give sudden rejects more


[09/27/2021 4:43 PM] geezar#8187
I stick to 163 range 125w or lower


[09/27/2021 4:43 PM] geezar#8187
1080/2600/125 a sweet spot IMO


[09/27/2021 4:44 PM] geezar#8187
No rejects


[09/27/2021 4:44 PM] Deathmumi#1369
depends your card. my sweetspot 116w 173mhs


[09/27/2021 4:44 PM] Deathmumi#1369
while this is asus tuf but gigbayte 129w 171mhs


[09/27/2021 4:45 PM] Deathmumi#1369
everycards silicone voltage limits differs


[09/27/2021 4:45 PM] geezar#8187
I've had some sit 111w some 10w higher annoying yep


[09/27/2021 4:45 PM] Deathmumi#1369
need to find theirs


[09/27/2021 4:45 PM] geezar#8187
full send you can see much higher - on ERG they sit well 170 but 165 was much safer and lower power IMO


[09/27/2021 4:46 PM] Deathmumi#1369
surely for 3070 sticking around 165-170 good


[09/27/2021 4:46 PM] Deathmumi#1369
from one point its later takes so much power to add hashes


[09/27/2021 4:46 PM] geezar#8187
yep, depends on the rejects 173 with 2700-2800 mem but touch too high


[09/27/2021 4:47 PM] geezar#8187
yep exactly


[09/27/2021 4:47 PM] geezar#8187

[09/27/2021 4:47 PM] Deathmumi#1369
under 90w ? üòÑ it maybe around 125mhs


[09/27/2021 4:48 PM] geezar#8187

@SnowPea you need to try Apex config


[09/27/2021 4:57 PM] geezar#8187
-LHR 85 seems sweet spot for your 60ti


[09/27/2021 4:58 PM] SnowPea#7485
In trex or nbminer?


[09/27/2021 4:58 PM] geezar#8187
Deathmumi too as above - scroll up dude


[09/27/2021 4:58 PM] geezar#8187
some very nice numbers


[09/27/2021 4:58 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, lhr 85 as start, and it decreases to 84.5 and stays there


[09/27/2021 4:58 PM] apexpool#3878
where is that?


[09/27/2021 4:59 PM] SnowPea#7485
This is in the new trex web ui setting

[09/27/2021 5:02 PM] geezar#8187
assuming you do not have Hynix ofc
`For GPUs with non-Hynix GDDR6 memory, e.g. 3060 3060ti 3070, start trying with **-lhr 85**`


[09/27/2021 5:02 PM] SnowPea#7485
I have hynix lol


[09/27/2021 5:03 PM] SnowPea#7485

[09/27/2021 5:03 PM] geezar#8187
fk..


[09/27/2021 5:03 PM] SnowPea#7485
Its alright, just hope they'll find something for hynix in the next update


[09/27/2021 5:03 PM] geezar#8187
`For GPUs with Hynix GDDR6 memory, LHR mode is not recommended for the poor performance.` but you know that already..


[09/27/2021 5:04 PM] SnowPea#7485
Yes, i read that, but just want to give it a try


[09/27/2021 5:04 PM] SnowPea#7485

[09/27/2021 5:22 PM] ercovero#0957
you can push it til l2700 on memory clock ,it works for me


[09/27/2021 5:24 PM] ercovero#0957
trex got lhr mode too?


[09/27/2021 5:45 PM] apexpool#3878
not for ergo for now, I believe


[09/27/2021 5:46 PM] ercovero#0957
ok ok


[09/27/2021 5:50 PM] Deathmumi#1369
Trex only have for eth for now and works well beyond nbminer


[09/27/2021 5:50 PM] Deathmumi#1369
i hope trex new ergo lhr release will go more good too


[09/27/2021 5:54 PM] apexpool#3878
we are all waiting for t-rex lhr version for ergo


[09/27/2021 5:54 PM] apexpool#3878
I guess üôÇ


[09/27/2021 5:59 PM] Deathmumi#1369
Ah! üòÑ i am not enemy for other developers yet i found trex more stable and usefull


[09/27/2021 6:00 PM] apexpool#3878
me too, but now I have to admit that the nbminer lhr unlock for 3060ti is really good.


[09/27/2021 6:01 PM] Deathmumi#1369
of course getting 20mhs more is good option while trex done better for me üòÑ


[09/27/2021 6:01 PM] geezar#8187
Some other miners including lolminer worth checking out guys - I always test the others too, lolminer in particular was my go-to on 3060's


[09/27/2021 6:01 PM] Herk#6019
nbminer is definitely easier to use atm


[09/27/2021 6:02 PM] Herk#6019
does most of the heavy work with LHR for you


[09/27/2021 6:02 PM] geezar#8187
pretty sure lol was the 1st to release the tweaks.. may be wrong


[09/27/2021 6:02 PM] geezar#8187
`Changes over 1.31
Beta Feature: Added RTX 3000 series semi-unlock for LHR v2 cards giving up to 30% more performance then in locked state. Use --mode LHR2 to call it (and --mode LHR1 for 3060 LHR1 cards). Also added a low power LHR mode for V2 cards (--mode LHRLP). See below for more details. Recommended drivers for LHR2 and LHRLP: 470.63.01 or 465.31 - others could be more unstable. Most tests were done in Linux. Use --lhrtune to improve either performance or stability. Read the guide for configuring here: https://github.com/Lolliedieb/lolMiner-releases/wiki/Nvidia-Mode-Switch-&-LHR-Semi-Unlock (2)
Improved performance of RTX 3060 LHR v1 semi-unlock by 2-3% depending on configuration - at same low consumption!`


[09/27/2021 6:02 PM] Herk#6019
so if you don't know how to or like easy settings then it's the way to go


[09/27/2021 6:03 PM] geezar#8187
Yep - I just had lower reported power using T recently so opted for that


[09/27/2021 6:03 PM] Deathmumi#1369
I' m more windows user so, trex more stable i think


[09/27/2021 6:03 PM] Deathmumi#1369
under linux based other ones good when they call for more tweak too


[09/27/2021 6:03 PM] geezar#8187
24/7 mining those fee's stack up too - Lol is 1.5%


[09/27/2021 6:04 PM] geezar#8187
2% for T - I have no issue paying a fee but it's worth consideration with your yield


[09/27/2021 6:06 PM] geezar#8187
nano on 2.5%....


[09/27/2021 6:07 PM] geezar#8187
agree with this - weeks of testing settings with clocks and pretty much out of the gate NB does well, hope newer releases make the same different to 70/80's too


[09/27/2021 6:09 PM] Deathmumi#1369
as spoke for dev cuts ok but lolminer not mining well where trex comes more hashes


[09/27/2021 6:10 PM] Deathmumi#1369
also lolminer always gives late releases of windows


[09/27/2021 6:14 PM] andee#4722
its important to check poolside, not only what the miner reports. lolminer includes the dips for dataset creation and also subtracts devfee in the displayed hashrate from what I gathered


[09/27/2021 6:19 PM] geezar#8187
I used lolminer for many months, it represents the actual hash as opposed to smoothing things out - little more of a rollercoaster to monitor the hash but really good results - for me I test all of the new releases - AMD only really TRM but there are others too


[09/27/2021 6:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
If I do that my lhr goes crazy and my hash drops to 150-160 stable or 102 crash


[09/27/2021 6:43 PM] Deleted User#0000

[09/27/2021 6:45 PM] apexpool#3878
what card?


[09/27/2021 6:46 PM] Deathmumi#1369
Than you need to try it lower lhr mode


[09/27/2021 6:48 PM] Deathmumi#1369
Lhr mode means exaple %85 mean lower your card power so it feels like not reach to limit where it drops hashes

for me too, over 140w kicks in for 2 of 3 cards. sometimes 140, too.


[09/27/2021 7:53 PM] apexpool#3878
135 is "safe"


[09/27/2021 7:53 PM] geezar#8187
I can vouch for those settings @Deleted User one thing however 1w on the PL either way and hash drops off a cliff... very small increments are needed


[09/27/2021 7:53 PM] geezar#8187
141 rock solid either side... no go

can you tell me what 3070 ti you buy?

do you still have the box you buy on 3070 ti?

EVGA blacks or FTW gives 180

Sup guys im quite new to this mining and im only using my pc for it.

I wonder if someone else uses the evga 3080ti ftw3 ultra graphic card and with my OC of +1000 mhz on mem. -600 mhz on core and PL 80% voltage set +15% and I get a stable 258MH/s.
Im using evga p1 for OC and is my hashrate good or bad


[09/28/2021 7:40 AM] SchermaN#3518
Oh and I run NBminer with a eff/watt 0.950


[09/28/2021 7:45 AM] apexpool#3878
hashrate is good, but efficiency is bad, according to the spreadsheet in the pinned messages 
you should be able to stay around 215w, someone even got 261 MH/s with 190w. try limiting the power more, and check different OC settings from that spreadsheet, too.


[09/28/2021 7:46 AM] SchermaN#3518
Aight, i will go back and tweek it some more:)


[09/28/2021 8:35 AM] SchermaN#3518
A litte uppdate.
Mem.clock +1148 (10400mhz)
C.C -650 (1215mhz)
Voltage 20% (975mV)
P.L 58% 

With this i get around 254MH/s 
While using 230W 
Eff/wat is not 1.102

good day. just got 2nd card, is it possible to use amd memory tweak on multiple cards?


[09/28/2021 10:48 AM] apexpool#3878
which os? I am using it on 2 different cards on hiveos.


[09/28/2021 10:56 AM] Swim#4211
Ahh I'm using windows atm. getting about 198 as the bottom left reading


[09/28/2021 10:56 AM] Swim#4211
Just got a new card, waiting new psu to fit it. AMD tweak tool seems to have 1 tab for my cards settings so when I can add the other I'm guessing a new tab will pop up?


[09/28/2021 10:57 AM] Swim#4211
Luckily I can use the same settings for both & seem to get the same rate


[09/28/2021 11:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
Generally higher end 3070ti so base line asus and evga and up will get you that consistently

Morning guys, so my rig was up for almost 2 days (1 day 21hrs) and it just had a bsod, the event id was 1001, i tried to google it and it said it could be a lot of things, do you guys have any experience on this?

Hello guys, I just installed a 3rd gpu 3060ti ftw3 on my 750w PSU. Every time I mine for one hour my pc crashes and reboots. Looking at the reliability monitor i am getting this code: Live Kernel Event Code 141. 

It shows up as hardware error.

[09/28/2021 8:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
3060tis can pull upto 200w, maybe the 750w isnt enough


[09/28/2021 9:00 PM] apexpool#3878
for Erg it should use about 100w, if the settings are optimized.


[09/28/2021 9:35 PM] Wii#9265
Let‚Äôs say the rig base (fan, CPU etc) draws 20 W


[09/28/2021 9:35 PM] Wii#9265
Each card 300


[09/28/2021 9:35 PM] Wii#9265
So 320W


[09/28/2021 9:35 PM] Wii#9265
Then assume that the cards sometimes get quick spikes of 200-250W


[09/28/2021 9:36 PM] Wii#9265
Worst case scenario the PSU gets over the limit


[09/28/2021 9:36 PM] Wii#9265
That‚Äôs what I have heard at least


[09/28/2021 10:24 PM] geezar#8187
My dual core celeron and 4GB with mining mobo pulls 42w at the wall. Some gaming mobo‚Äôs and CPU‚Äôs pull a lot more... unless you have the PL set low and fully configured properly that 750w @enricoxg could quickly become a fire hazard worse case. Also when using the reported in mining power it can be misleading. Depending on the rating too it will be running well over efficiency levels personally aim for 75-80% max peak power usage on PSU‚Äôs


[09/28/2021 11:47 PM] Herk#6019
his issue is somewhere else imo, might be oc or something else dying, having a system and 3x 3060ti‚Äôs on a 750W isn‚Äôt so bad as long as you manage the power usage on them


[09/28/2021 11:48 PM] Herk#6019
even with a 100W usage for the system itself you should still be well below the golden 80% with them with proper settings


[09/28/2021 11:48 PM] Herk#6019
more like 50%ish


[09/28/2021 11:49 PM] Herk#6019
as long as you have a decent psu ofc


[09/28/2021 11:50 PM] Herk#6019
also if it is a decent quality and you spike over, it should trigger some protection and actually stop it - not bsod on you


[09/29/2021 12:11 AM] SnowPea#7485
Quick question, am I not suppose to use a riser on a pcie x4 lane on the mobo?


[09/29/2021 12:26 AM] andee#4722
that works just fine


[09/29/2021 12:32 AM] SnowPea#7485
Thank you, so maybe i have a bad slot or something. I had 3 cards, the one that plugged into the x4 slot is recognized as gpu#0 in trex and it was the one that kept crashing, then i swapped another card into the slot and  it crashed again (different error code)


[09/29/2021 12:47 AM] enricoxg#4264
Thank you the help! I will try and see if the problem still occurs if I change that gpu to a second psu.


[09/29/2021 12:48 AM] enricoxg#4264
Thanks for the feedback. I don‚Äôt think I got any bsod, it just mines for an hour and then my 3rd gpu just stops and crashes my computer and then automatically restarts to my login page.

guys i have a 2070 super 2x8pin a rx570 1x8pin and a vega 64 sapphire nitro 3x8pin sadly the psu i bought 750w g3 evga only have 4 VGA ports. what do? i need 6 total i hope to use team red miner to limit power consumption to around 450w also i dont plan on using risers i just wanna build in a normal pc case was thinking thermal takes p3 cause it looks nice and seems to have good air flow, any idea on the case and wether i should go for a diff psu, only one i could find with 6vga ports is a 1200 or 1300 psu and that bitch costs 250% more, please help üò´


[09/29/2021 2:21 AM] SnowPea#7485
If i were you, i would get a 2nd psu and  use a jumper board to connect it, then use risers and build everything on a wire rack Ziyituod Add2PSU Multiple Power adapters, ATX 24Pin to SATA Multiple PSU Power connectors BTC Miner's Dual sync Start Card (Power Supply for Bitcoin Coin Mining) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0948TJFTK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apan_glt_fabc_VMRV20DDQA1R5H0WVW6J?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

I know you said you dont plan on using risers, but i think the air flow is better on a rack


[09/29/2021 2:23 AM] Salu#0001
nah man ive seen enough horror stories on bad risers, appreciate the advice tho


[09/29/2021 2:23 AM] SnowPea#7485
If you really have to keep it in a case, then getting a new 1000w psu is the only choice


[09/29/2021 2:23 AM] Salu#0001

[09/29/2021 2:23 AM] Salu#0001
thats all i needed to hear


[09/29/2021 2:24 AM] SnowPea#7485
Ive been looking at some evga psu too


[09/29/2021 2:24 AM] SnowPea#7485
This one has 6 vga ports https://www.evga.com/products/product.aspx?pn=120-G2-1000-XR


[09/29/2021 2:25 AM] Salu#0001
are g2 and g3 compatible, no right?


[09/29/2021 2:25 AM] Salu#0001
but yes ive used en evga psu for years theyre reliable


[09/29/2021 2:25 AM] Salu#0001
cheers man


[09/29/2021 2:26 AM] SnowPea#7485
You can use a single psu right?


[09/29/2021 2:26 AM] SnowPea#7485
With enough ports


[09/29/2021 2:27 AM] Salu#0001
meaning? yeah im torn between these two cases either the thermal take p3 or this piece of shit

yeah thats the plan


[09/29/2021 2:29 AM] SnowPea#7485
I mean if you get the 1000w one, you can only use a single psu for all cards, so there shouldnt be compatibility issue


[09/29/2021 2:29 AM] Salu#0001
i mean under mining load i will not be pulling more than 400+ watts


[09/29/2021 2:30 AM] Salu#0001
this just removes all fear that somthing might burn or some shit


[09/29/2021 2:30 AM] SnowPea#7485
Im using a wire rack, cant help you with cases lol


[09/29/2021 2:30 AM] Salu#0001
lol an opinion is all i need but i guess ill go with the diy shitbox


[09/29/2021 2:32 AM] SnowPea#7485
Ahh, im sorry, i should take a step back, what are the tdps for those cards? Even if you are planning to limit the power at 400w, there might be chances where the cards will use max power, and when they do, you want to make sure your psu can take the load


[09/29/2021 2:32 AM] Salu#0001
thats another thing im scared of


[09/29/2021 2:33 AM] Salu#0001
so the 2070 215w the rx570 is 150w and the vega 64 i think is 375?


[09/29/2021 2:33 AM] Salu#0001
my cpu is a 3000g and thats 35w


[09/29/2021 2:33 AM] SnowPea#7485
If you're gonna use the open frame diy box, why not just use a wire rack with the cards plugged onto the mobo?


[09/29/2021 2:33 AM] Salu#0001
define wire rack

[09/29/2021 10:29 AM] geezar#8187
?


[09/29/2021 10:29 AM] Salu#0001
Yeah it looks like a nodded bios I think


[09/29/2021 10:30 AM] Salu#0001
Yes


[09/29/2021 10:30 AM] Salu#0001
Then I unistalled it in device manager


[09/29/2021 10:30 AM] geezar#8187
so 2 GPU's displayed correct?


[09/29/2021 10:30 AM] Salu#0001
Well to be honest I'm. Not sure I just got it today used


[09/29/2021 10:30 AM] Salu#0001
Correct


[09/29/2021 10:30 AM] geezar#8187
Ok so BIOS modded GPU's often are not seen unless you have run the patcher tool


[09/29/2021 10:30 AM] Salu#0001
Now after the ddu and reinstall block chain drivers both show with green ticks


[09/29/2021 10:30 AM] geezar#8187
key here is getting Windows to recognise the GPU


[09/29/2021 10:31 AM] geezar#8187
block chain driver not needed


[09/29/2021 10:31 AM] geezar#8187
native windows driver is OK to get up and running then see if you need to go back to much older driver


[09/29/2021 10:31 AM] Salu#0001
Yeah HW nor msi after burner see the gpu


[09/29/2021 10:31 AM] geezar#8187
so native (default) drivers for both the Nvidia + AMD GPU is OK


[09/29/2021 10:31 AM] Salu#0001
Like they see it but no clocks


[09/29/2021 10:31 AM] geezar#8187
Step one - DDU Nvidia + AMD


[09/29/2021 10:32 AM] geezar#8187
Step two - Let Windows Update re-install the native driver


[09/29/2021 10:32 AM] geezar#8187
Step three - Confirm both AMD + nVIDIA GPU's can be seen in the Device manager (no errors)


[09/29/2021 10:32 AM] geezar#8187
Ignore blockchain driver etc...


[09/29/2021 10:32 AM] geezar#8187
Do that and ping back here


[09/29/2021 10:33 AM] geezar#8187
Remember DDU twice - BOTH drivers


[09/29/2021 10:33 AM] Salu#0001
No no I have a 2080ti in my system that I plan to use for gaming.... Does that complicate things?


[09/29/2021 10:33 AM] Salu#0001
Well it's the end of the night I really appreciate the help but it's 5am here I'm nodding off


[09/29/2021 10:33 AM] geezar#8187
No - it will have the driver later for gaming - default drivers are OK for the moment


[09/29/2021 10:33 AM] geezar#8187
ok... good luck


[09/29/2021 10:33 AM] Salu#0001
I'll ddu it again in the morning but I'm only going to do the amd card


[09/29/2021 10:34 AM] Salu#0001
Second step let device manager update driver from there? Or download most recent amd drivers?


[09/29/2021 10:34 AM] Salu#0001
Really appreciate the help my man


[09/29/2021 10:38 AM] Salu#0001
Thank you

[09/29/2021 3:04 PM] Ananas#9063
i can return the cards if they are shit, but the ones i got from them in the past were fine


[09/29/2021 3:06 PM] Ananas#9063
also might be an issue with their bios, luckily the cards have 4 bioses


[09/29/2021 3:09 PM] SnowPea#7485
It's a msi ventus 2x 3060ti lhr, the stock fan was broken so i replaced it two 120mm fans


[09/29/2021 3:26 PM] Sazzik#9402
is this good, if not, any suggestion on how to make it better? Its a Asus ROG Strix 11G 1080ti

I would try lowering power


[09/29/2021 3:29 PM] Ananas#9063
ok thankfully the BIOS was the reason TRM said GPU is dead


[09/29/2021 3:29 PM] Ananas#9063
switched BIOS to default one, it's now doing 49 mh at base clocks


[09/29/2021 3:30 PM] Ananas#9063
andee any idea what makes a modded bios break a card?


[09/29/2021 3:30 PM] Ananas#9063
They manually set the overclock settings for the cards in BIOS, I think that may have been an issue


[09/29/2021 3:30 PM] Sazzik#9402
if  Ido that, go from PL:80 to PL:60  I lose like 10MH/s


[09/29/2021 3:31 PM] andee#4722
voltage set too low in bios maybe?

[09/29/2021 3:32 PM] andee#4722
and how many watts less? if you use 50W for 10MH, thats pretty inefficient


[09/29/2021 3:32 PM] geezar#8187
Sometimes on the mining GPU's they struggled to hold over 1100 @Ananas 100% worth dropping down the clocks


[09/29/2021 3:32 PM] Ananas#9063
yea idk why they would BIOS mod the clocks


[09/29/2021 3:32 PM] Ananas#9063
that's just asking for trouble


[09/29/2021 3:32 PM] Sazzik#9402

mby trouble is the wrong word, more like pain in the ass. if they are bad settings you have to remod the bios, just extra work


[09/29/2021 3:33 PM] Ananas#9063
that looks better imo @Sazzik


[09/29/2021 3:33 PM] andee#4722
pretty normal in bigger operations, put in tuning rig, tune card, flash bios, put in rig


[09/29/2021 3:34 PM] geezar#8187
Sure you can get the power down on that bad boy


[09/29/2021 3:34 PM] Ananas#9063
just weird how their BIOS makes the card dead no matter what settings/algo I tried


[09/29/2021 3:34 PM] geezar#8187
those old girls can still hash well for sure


[09/29/2021 3:34 PM] Ananas#9063
mby motherboard diff can cause that, idk


[09/29/2021 3:35 PM] geezar#8187
@Ananas when I have had this - stock BIOS is the way to go


[09/29/2021 3:35 PM] geezar#8187
you have no idea if someone messed with the straps + the power/undervolt etc


[09/29/2021 3:35 PM] Sazzik#9402

hmmm


[09/29/2021 3:35 PM] Ananas#9063

@Sazzik OC is too high


[09/29/2021 3:37 PM] Ananas#9063
this error pops up when you tune the card too high


[09/29/2021 3:37 PM] geezar#8187

make sure your memory type matches if youre gonna copy changes


[09/29/2021 3:38 PM] andee#4722
reduce memtweak and/or mem oc


[09/29/2021 3:39 PM] geezar#8187
Micron seems to really like the high mem clock


[09/29/2021 3:39 PM] geezar#8187
so I run 200/1700/140


[09/29/2021 3:39 PM] geezar#8187
yes... I know sounds high but as above not rejects


[09/29/2021 3:39 PM] geezar#8187
so I guess in windows half the mem


[09/29/2021 3:39 PM] Sazzik#9402
hm you have it in hiveOS right?


[09/29/2021 3:39 PM] geezar#8187
set PL to something like 150 to start


[09/29/2021 3:39 PM] Sazzik#9402
yeah okej


[09/29/2021 3:39 PM] geezar#8187
Not a Hive OS user but should be the same


[09/29/2021 3:40 PM] geezar#8187
TBH any higher on the power and would not run it - 141w reported is as far as I want to go but for 120 MH/s seems OK for what it is


[09/29/2021 3:41 PM] geezar#8187
By comparison a 3060 LHR will run the same for < 99w.. but a lot newer


[09/29/2021 3:41 PM] geezar#8187
125/-200/150 was posted on the google sheet - that was an easy 100 MH/s all day long too but to get more I found the mem clock needed a push


[09/29/2021 3:42 PM] geezar#8187
@Sazzik Micron mem right?


[09/29/2021 3:42 PM] Sazzik#9402
I think so, not 100% sure


[09/29/2021 3:44 PM] geezar#8187
Ok T-Rex and see if she will hold with  `--mt 6 --intensity 25` also a good idea is `--validate-shares` as you can see couple days shares, no rejects or crashes


[09/29/2021 3:44 PM] Sazzik#9402
nice ill try that.


[09/29/2021 3:48 PM] geezar#8187
Keep us posted - had 115 MH/s around 135w but think 140-150w is where you will end up dude


[09/29/2021 3:48 PM] Sazzik#9402
I get this error when i add --mt 6

[09/29/2021 3:49 PM] geezar#8187
you need to right click open as admin when you launch or add the admin privs to the exe


[09/29/2021 3:49 PM] geezar#8187
`--mt                       Memory tweak mode (default: 0 - disabled). Range from 0 to 6. General recommendation
                                   is to start with 1, and then increase only if the GPU is stable.
                                   The effect is similar to that of ETHlargementPill.
                                   Supported on Pascal GPUs with GDDR5 or GDDR5X memory only.
                                   Requires running the miner with administrative privileges.
                                   Can be set to a comma separated list to apply different values to different cards.
                                   Example: --mt 4 (applies tweak mode #4 to all cards that support this functionality)
                                            --mt 3,3,3,0 (applies tweak mode #3 to all cards except the last one)`


[09/29/2021 3:50 PM] geezar#8187
`Requires running the miner with administrative privileges.`


[09/29/2021 3:50 PM] Sazzik#9402
aaah, i tried to run the .bat file in admin didnt work! Now it started give me a sec üôÇ


[09/29/2021 3:51 PM] geezar#8187
Longer term you can change the security on that executable but up to you if you want to do this, closed source and all that


[09/29/2021 3:51 PM] Ananas#9063
sometimes the miner wont launch in admin priviliges when you do it through a bat file, might need to give admin priviliges for the .exe file in the miner folder


[09/29/2021 3:51 PM] Ananas#9063
but afaik only trex needs that, i dont remember nbminer needing it


[09/29/2021 3:51 PM] Ananas#9063
nvm nbminer needs it too


[09/29/2021 3:52 PM] Ananas#9063
just set nbminer.exe to run this program as an administrator in compatibility settings


[09/29/2021 3:54 PM] geezar#8187
Only suggesting using T as I had good results TBH - NB still messing with these LHR settings and not seeing much difference TBH


[09/29/2021 3:56 PM] Ananas#9063
yep, trex is gigachad, def use that on nvidia cards.


[09/29/2021 3:56 PM] Ananas#9063
and i think nbminer doesnt have -mt setting either


[09/29/2021 3:56 PM] Ananas#9063
afaik -mt is a trex only thing, i might be wrong though

[09/29/2021 4:16 PM] SnowPea#7485
I set the core at -245 and also lock the core clock at 1282, mem at 1350


[09/29/2021 4:17 PM] Ananas#9063
which OS is that?


[09/29/2021 4:17 PM] SnowPea#7485
Windows, this is the trex web ui


[09/29/2021 4:17 PM] Ananas#9063
ah


[09/29/2021 4:17 PM] SnowPea#7485
I cant get the same number in hiveos


[09/29/2021 4:17 PM] SnowPea#7485
It wouldnt even go pass 110 somehow, so i siwtched back to windows


[09/29/2021 4:17 PM] Ananas#9063
linux driver can be set to 100w, windows can be set to 99w without modifying voltage


[09/29/2021 4:18 PM] Ananas#9063
you cant set linux driver to 99 PL


[09/29/2021 4:19 PM] SnowPea#7485
I didnt set power limit, when i locked the core, the power just went down, some times it'll fluctuate between 88w to 92w, but stay at 90w most of the time


[09/29/2021 4:19 PM] Ananas#9063
ah interesting so no voltage or PL changes at all


[09/29/2021 4:19 PM] SnowPea#7485
Nope


[09/29/2021 4:20 PM] SnowPea#7485
But the temp has to be 50 and above, if it hit 48c, lhr mode kicks in and it will keep cooling down and has rate drops to 60~70


[09/29/2021 4:21 PM] SnowPea#7485
So i set the fan at tc: 52


[09/29/2021 4:22 PM] SnowPea#7485
And it used to crash when it went above 56c, but now that i put the riser on a different slot (pcie x4 before, pcie x16 now), it wont crash even at 60c


[09/29/2021 4:32 PM] Ananas#9063
interesting, have you tried fan at fix 90%?


[09/29/2021 4:32 PM] Ananas#9063
higher fan usually means less chance of LHR kicking in from my exp


[09/29/2021 4:35 PM] Sazzik#9402
how do I apply mt 6 in hive os?


[09/29/2021 4:36 PM] Ananas#9063
overclock settings, then on the bottom there is "advanced options" or something like that


[09/29/2021 4:36 PM] Ananas#9063
it will have an information icon, click that, it will tell you


[09/29/2021 4:46 PM] SnowPea#7485
No, interestingly, lhr kicks in when this card is too cold, i used to fix the fan at 75% last week when it was hot, when it got cooler on one night, the temp dropped below 48c and lhr kicked in for the whole night


[09/29/2021 4:47 PM] Sazzik#9402
im blind üòõ cant find it haha

I think you can to set it in miner config

[09/29/2021 4:54 PM] SnowPea#7485
You also got it down to 90w too right?


[09/29/2021 4:54 PM] geezar#8187
@Sazzik GDDR5 Mem responds well with it - not just the GDDR5X, try adding mt 4 for the 1070 you have and maybe mt 3 for the 3GB 1060's


[09/29/2021 4:54 PM] geezar#8187
no.....


[09/29/2021 4:55 PM] geezar#8187

[09/29/2021 4:55 PM] SnowPea#7485
Is your 3060 evga?


[09/29/2021 4:55 PM] Sazzik#9402
how do i do that? Im not that familiar with hiveos


[09/29/2021 4:55 PM] geezar#8187
V1 and does 126 MH/s but at 100w not 90w


[09/29/2021 4:56 PM] geezar#8187
Not using Hive - must be custom miner params or something


[09/29/2021 4:56 PM] SnowPea#7485
Yea, thats true


[09/29/2021 4:56 PM] geezar#8187
basically an entry field that will allow you to edit the string


[09/29/2021 4:57 PM] geezar#8187
90w is nuts... well worth looking at LHR's for that power


[09/29/2021 4:57 PM] Ananas#9063
yea i havent tried what snowpea did


[09/29/2021 4:57 PM] geezar#8187
Same as Apex - his GPU's are created by the angels of low power


[09/29/2021 4:57 PM] Ananas#9063
ill mess around with it a bit next time i have my hands on a 3060

[09/29/2021 4:59 PM] SnowPea#7485
Apex is the God of OC, i wish he could get a 3060ti with hynix mem and figure out how to get it to 145mh at 100w lol


[09/29/2021 4:59 PM] geezar#8187
lol agree been chasing his low 70ti for weeks.... (and failed...)


[09/29/2021 5:00 PM] geezar#8187
You know he's going to end up with one sooner or later when he builds that 2nd rig...


[09/29/2021 5:01 PM] SnowPea#7485
Nice, cant wait to see that

now it started! Thx! 
Still the same MH/s but now it run haha


[09/29/2021 5:23 PM] Ananas#9063
does lolminer zombie mode still allow you to mine with 4gb cards on ETH?


[09/29/2021 5:24 PM] Ananas#9063
googled around and saw some posts from 3-4 months ago


[09/29/2021 5:24 PM] Ananas#9063
not sure if its still good


[09/29/2021 5:24 PM] andee#4722
probably very slow even with x16 slot and fast system ram

Hi


[09/29/2021 5:58 PM] caxlero#1075
I have a mining script, but I don't understand much.


[09/29/2021 5:59 PM] SnowPea#7485
Did you read the readme file?


[09/29/2021 6:00 PM] caxlero#1075
Nop


[09/29/2021 6:00 PM] caxlero#1075
why?


[09/29/2021 6:01 PM] SnowPea#7485
Ok, so whats your question?


[09/29/2021 6:01 PM] caxlero#1075
I just want to change my miner from t-rex to nanominer


[09/29/2021 6:01 PM] caxlero#1075
but I don't know how to do it


[09/29/2021 6:02 PM] SnowPea#7485

[09/29/2021 6:04 PM] Swim#4211
Hey can anyone help me? I just got my 2nd card, both give 197 Mh/s individually but when I run them both my primary GPU (0) gives only 175 but the secondary (1) gives 203. I don't know what im missing or doing wrong. its on windows btw, 4g mode enabled, crossfire off, is this normal?


[09/29/2021 6:06 PM] SnowPea#7485
When you download nanominer, it should come with some pre-populated bat files like trex, just update the bat file using the same info from be trex bat file, replace the pool address and your wallet address and that should do it


[09/29/2021 6:10 PM] caxlero#1075
I will try here

Oh, thats an HP 3060ti non lhr


[09/29/2021 6:47 PM] SnowPea#7485
I bought a hp pavilion two months ago


[09/29/2021 6:48 PM] SnowPea#7485
Many ppl predicted its gonna be a lhr but it turned out to be non lhr


[09/29/2021 7:07 PM] geezar#8187
last time I tried couple months back was 12 MH/s or so... technically possible but no longer as good as it was


[09/29/2021 8:32 PM] miner29#2975
and with each passing epoch will only be less and less MH/s


[09/29/2021 9:09 PM] Ananas#9063
what could be the reason for 470 4gb cards to intermittently drop to ~40 mh, then back up again?


[09/29/2021 9:09 PM] Ananas#9063
consumption doesnt change

you will have to search for it, or check if your card has a bios switch


[09/29/2021 9:23 PM] andee#4722
the one I linked was released 7 hours ago, probably supports the newest driver


[09/29/2021 9:24 PM] Salu#0001
okay so flash bios > new driver > patcher, correct?


[09/29/2021 9:24 PM] Salu#0001
could you recoomend a tool for bios flashing?


[09/29/2021 9:25 PM] andee#4722

Dear @mhs_sam  . We really appreciate your contribution to the development of the ERGO infrastructure, but we would like to solo mine on our own node, the node is installed without problems, it synchronizes well, but when you install the one developed by you
ErgoStratumProxy  https://github.com/mhssamadani/ErgoStratumProxy errors occur and it is not clear how to fix them. Please help us with the ErgoStratumProxy code so that everything works well. With deep respect to you.

Hey, you should use the stratum server not the stratum proxy.
Proxy is used when you want to mine with open source miner (client side app)


[09/30/2021 2:28 PM] caxlero#1075
any of you mine using linux?


[09/30/2021 3:00 PM] Alex | WoolyPooly.com#8134
Could you pls move to nbminer for checking that issue?

Whats the diference on ergo for lhr 3 cards vs lhr 2 cards ?


[10/01/2021 5:34 AM] Sam2Can#6957
Difficulty is going to take quite some time to level off as more hashrate is dropped. TBH pools can help mitigate this for little cost. There is a pool (I won't mention it by name) for RVN that offers bonus rewards based on time online. These rewards come, I guess from the operator's wallets. It's small but it does aide in encouraging people to stick around.


[10/01/2021 7:56 AM] Salu#0001
Guys I have a budget of around 800-1000 whats the best cards I can buy with this? I don't mind going used


[10/01/2021 8:34 AM] DukeHG#6485
You should find whatever higher cards with that price then you should be ok


[10/01/2021 9:13 AM] Elemental#9509

Is it better to use the AMD blockchain driver or the adrenaline driver for windows? Using vega 56


[10/01/2021 10:26 AM] Swim#4211
I'm suffering major hashrate loss after adding 2nd card & still not fixed it. I'm trying workarounds


[10/01/2021 10:30 AM] Swim#4211
Don't have access to compute mode with vega 56. Bios pcie gen settings dont change anything

Not used the block chain driver for years - newer drivers are fine on the Vegas

[10/01/2021 12:33 PM] apexpool#3878
is it normal for Vega 56 cards to have different versions of Bios on the 2 positions? do they come like this from the factory, or it means the bios was flashed if they are different?
I noticed the power cap is different between the 2 positions on both my cards.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[10/01/2021 2:25 PM] Swim#4211
I think they come with the same bios on both sides but one is limited in power. You can overwrite one with a 64 bios of your card type and have the other as a backup but I just left mine since it's red dragon & has no 64 version


[10/01/2021 2:26 PM] apexpool#3878
they seem identical, except the power limit.


[10/01/2021 2:26 PM] Swim#4211
So... I should probably try make a hiveOS boot usb & try again?


[10/01/2021 2:26 PM] apexpool#3878
I would not write a Vega 64 on my Vega 56 cards, I guess all I could get is higher power usage.


[10/01/2021 2:27 PM] Swim#4211
I use the rightside position. Too bad this wierd thing has come up on my windows miner where I cant pass 177 on 2nd card or change 1st card's mV on clock or memory without 20mh loss


[10/01/2021 2:27 PM] Swim#4211
same


[10/01/2021 2:28 PM] Swim#4211
What Generation PCIe settings do you use on your mobo bios?


[10/01/2021 2:28 PM] Swim#4211
They dont seem to change anything for me, I think my problem is there is no compute mode for vega 56 on windows or idk but I dont want this loss on every new card


[10/01/2021 2:29 PM] apexpool#3878

kernel panics when loading the NVidia driver...

I changed a few options in Bios and this was one of them.

yes, the cards can go over 200 MH/s, but with 165+ w, and I don't like it.


[10/01/2021 2:32 PM] Swim#4211
Ah i see, i have this other option called "Chipset Gen Switch" thats prob the 2nd one


[10/01/2021 2:32 PM] apexpool#3878
it is around 165w real anyway


[10/01/2021 2:32 PM] Swim#4211
Im sure I tried this but il give it another go


[10/01/2021 2:32 PM] Swim#4211
There is one more option to do with Lane Configuration


[10/01/2021 2:33 PM] Swim#4211
the choices are: Auto or 8x8 or 4x4x4x4


[10/01/2021 2:33 PM] Swim#4211
does this one matter?


[10/01/2021 2:33 PM] apexpool#3878
how many pci-ex slots do you have? I would pick the second option.


[10/01/2021 2:34 PM] Swim#4211
I have 2 fullsize ones and another 3 or 4 little brown ones


[10/01/2021 2:34 PM] Swim#4211
I have a card in each full size slot


[10/01/2021 2:34 PM] Swim#4211
the HDD connector is in the way a little so I tried a ribbon riser but no difference


[10/01/2021 2:34 PM] Swim#4211
it must be full connected either way


[10/01/2021 2:35 PM] Swim#4211
my mobo is a MSI b450m-A MAX pro

I didnt want to get anything too fancy as long as it worked to get me started


[10/01/2021 2:36 PM] Swim#4211
but now im thinking its either put a card in old machine and run 2x indi or get a hiveOS usb


[10/01/2021 2:36 PM] Swim#4211
im down 20+ Mh/s for the wattage


[10/01/2021 2:36 PM] apexpool#3878
I am using hiveos usb


[10/01/2021 2:36 PM] apexpool#3878

[10/02/2021 1:09 PM] Fir3#0726
Can I connect my second GPU on the small PCI e slot and skip the x16 slot?


[10/02/2021 1:09 PM] Fir3#0726
My card is recognized in windows, but miners or afterburner can't pick it up


[10/02/2021 1:13 PM] Fir3#0726
If I connect in the x16 big slot it crashes the PC, and tries to uninstall my main GPU


[10/02/2021 1:32 PM] andee#4722
check device manager. should work just fine


[10/02/2021 1:40 PM] andee#4722
majestic, tons of them around here


[10/02/2021 1:41 PM] andee#4722
are you running the leaked drivers and trying to run a v2 lhr?


[10/02/2021 1:42 PM] geezar#8187
even a single V2 on a non LHR rig will crash with pre 460.84 driver I've found for sure


[10/02/2021 3:30 PM] Swim#4211
hey guys im thinking of changing pool from hero prop to a 0% fee PPLN is this a bad idea & will I lose my shares if internet cuts out?


[10/02/2021 3:37 PM] andee#4722
depends on how long you are offline


[10/02/2021 3:52 PM] geezar#8187
PPLNS rewards staying on the pool 24 hours + - that said I did test Fly and Yield was significantly lower than other pools... too many variables and testing them out is the key - low fees are nice, even nicer is 0% as are increased speed of payouts (shorter than the standard 720 Transactions to mature)


[10/02/2021 3:55 PM] apexpool#3878
woolypooly has a lucky period


[10/02/2021 4:00 PM] Swim#4211
Thanks I'll prob just stick to Hero for now. It's actually concerning the top 2 have so much hashrate


[10/02/2021 4:01 PM] Swim#4211
I'd like to switch to safehash with its 0% fee & low population but the different operating method & potentially less reward bugs me


[10/02/2021 4:11 PM] andee#4722
I'm currently testing flypool, around `0.0013725` ERG per MH a day


[10/02/2021 4:14 PM] andee#4722
will probably switch 50% back to wooly, but had 3 very bad days there even though effort tracker said it should have been above average


[10/02/2021 4:14 PM] Swim#4211
How much is that per day per card?


[10/02/2021 4:15 PM] Swim#4211
i get a little over 190mh/s on average but 180w


[10/02/2021 4:15 PM] andee#4722
multiply it with your cards hashrate


[10/02/2021 4:15 PM] Swim#4211
ok


[10/02/2021 4:34 PM] SnowPea#7485
Thats actually very good, 2 days ago, my avg on hero was 0.000957 and yesterday was an extremely lucky day but the avg was still 0.001340 only


[10/02/2021 4:36 PM] andee#4722
went from a little over 1.4ERG a day on prev diff to ~1.64 now with 1.2GH


[10/02/2021 4:36 PM] andee#4722

[10/02/2021 4:37 PM] SnowPea#7485
Thats very nice


[10/02/2021 4:39 PM] SnowPea#7485
I had 0.4 erg on the prev diff and 0.56 now


[10/02/2021 4:39 PM] andee#4722
it has consistently been over herominers calculator, also over wooly's calculator


[10/02/2021 4:39 PM] SnowPea#7485
With 419mh


[10/02/2021 4:40 PM] SnowPea#7485
Herominer's calculator is always more than expect


[10/02/2021 4:41 PM] andee#4722
that was my experience while mining there. one of the reasons I use them to check when I am mining on other pools


[10/02/2021 4:58 PM] Dv#3650
This isn't true, it's a common misconception. We only need roughly 2 days of energy storage


[10/02/2021 4:59 PM] andee#4722
thats not massive for the whole world?


[10/02/2021 5:00 PM] andee#4722
where I live 90% of power comes from hydro and 10% from wind turbines. sometimes it can go weeks without any significant wind, even months


[10/02/2021 5:02 PM] andee#4722
I know of one project here where they will be using excess wind energy to pump water to the top of a mountain to use it as a "battery". but its impossible to use this method for all excess wind and sun power


[10/02/2021 5:05 PM] Fir3#0726
I got them to minings once, it's a 1070 ti and a 3080 LHR


[10/02/2021 5:06 PM] Fir3#0726
Before I assembled everything, I got it working on the x16 port to see if it worked, and no problems


[10/02/2021 5:06 PM] Fir3#0726
Then turned off computer, did some cable management and connected everything again


[10/02/2021 5:07 PM] Fir3#0726
And the PC just keeps blue screening


[10/02/2021 5:07 PM] Fir3#0726
Then I swapped to the other PCI lane, and the OC tries to uninstall de 3080


[10/02/2021 5:07 PM] Fir3#0726
PC*


[10/02/2021 5:07 PM] Fir3#0726
Starts lagging eventually I manage to get it up


[10/02/2021 5:08 PM] Fir3#0726
1070 ti shows on the device manager, but MSI ab can't pick it up, or the mining sodtware


[10/02/2021 5:08 PM] Fir3#0726
It's a really weird behaviour, I'm about to format the whole thing and try a-new


[10/02/2021 5:09 PM] Fir3#0726
I just ordered this riser to get my old card to mining instead of just laying around


[10/02/2021 5:10 PM] Dv#3650
Not really

It's usually driver related.  No exclamation marks in Device Manager?  Can I see a screenshot?


[10/02/2021 5:14 PM] andee#4722
my country is very small, but produces on average 153TWh every year of hydro and wind energy. how many tesla batteries are needed to store 2 days worth of energy?


[10/02/2021 5:15 PM] Dv#3650
Please watch that video, it's very informative


[10/02/2021 5:16 PM] andee#4722
I will. but even the people that are in charge of our hydro,wind and sun power infrastructure don't know how to store excess energy on large scale, so I doubt that some random dude on youtube has a solution for it


[10/02/2021 5:16 PM] Fir3#0726
There was on the 3080, which was installed and working before


[10/02/2021 5:16 PM] Fir3#0726
When I get home I'm gonna clean the whole mess and start again


[10/02/2021 5:17 PM] Dv#3650
You'd be surprised, I don't trust any government to properly handle much of anything. Must governments are extremely incompetent. I'm willing to discuss further after we've both been subjected to similar data


[10/02/2021 5:18 PM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
If drivers are installed.  Any new cards, or change of placement, give the OS time to load drivers to the correct hardware bus.


[10/02/2021 5:19 PM] Fir3#0726
Yes, but in this case it gives me blur screen


[10/02/2021 5:19 PM] Fir3#0726
Blue*


[10/02/2021 5:19 PM] Fir3#0726
And then bootlops until I have to restore the OS


[10/02/2021 5:19 PM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
hmm


[10/02/2021 5:19 PM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
try DDU the drivers and do each video card 1 by 1


[10/02/2021 5:19 PM] Fir3#0726
The weird shit is that it was working before


[10/02/2021 5:20 PM] andee#4722
Norway has handled hydro and wind turbines pretty well, we already have one water "battery" being built to utilize excess wind energy. using lithium ion is not a long term solution


[10/02/2021 5:20 PM] Fir3#0726
Only opened the slots to send the PCIex8 cables and data for the riser


[10/02/2021 5:20 PM] Fir3#0726
And it fucks up


[10/02/2021 5:22 PM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919

cables, power, etc


[10/02/2021 5:25 PM] Fir3#0726
It's got to be the PCI


[10/02/2021 5:25 PM] Fir3#0726
With power connected there is no issue


[10/02/2021 5:25 PM] Fir3#0726
As soon as I connect the PCI oorblem starts


[10/02/2021 5:26 PM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
PCI as in a riser or cable?

You're using a SATA cable to power the risers?


[10/02/2021 5:27 PM] Fir3#0726
Yeah, for the riser


[10/02/2021 5:28 PM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919

[10/02/2021 5:28 PM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
you'll see gorgeous pictures of burnt cables


[10/02/2021 5:30 PM] Fir3#0726
Yes, I'll check if this could be the reason


[10/02/2021 5:30 PM] Fir3#0726
I can connect it with another PCIe


[10/02/2021 5:31 PM] Fir3#0726
I got an extension here that can go from the cable to the entrance


[10/02/2021 5:31 PM] andee#4722
sata to 6 pin? that's way crazy


[10/02/2021 5:32 PM] Fir3#0726
Yeah, it's what came with it


[10/02/2021 5:32 PM] Fir3#0726
I've used it before, for watercooling parts, but the energy needed is nowhere near the same


[10/02/2021 5:32 PM] Fir3#0726
My pump is 5watt


[10/02/2021 5:32 PM] andee#4722
if it was 2x sata to 6 pin, okay


[10/02/2021 5:32 PM] andee#4722
but not like this


[10/02/2021 5:33 PM] Fir3#0726
Ok, so before I start


[10/02/2021 5:33 PM] Fir3#0726
From one PCIe cable with 2x8 exits


[10/02/2021 5:33 PM] Fir3#0726
Can ti can ECT the x6 to the riser and the X8 go the GPU?


[10/02/2021 5:33 PM] Fir3#0726
PCIe has no problems with that load right?


[10/02/2021 5:33 PM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
yes


[10/02/2021 5:34 PM] Fir3#0726

I connect the 1070ti and the 3080 gets messed up


[10/02/2021 6:10 PM] Fir3#0726
I have disabled fast boot aswell, so the card are properly picked up during boot


[10/02/2021 6:10 PM] Fir3#0726

[10/02/2021 6:19 PM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
You might need a couple of reboots


[10/02/2021 6:19 PM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
Check your bios, there are some settings to changed, like set everything to Gen2 and above 4G encoding enabled.


[10/02/2021 6:20 PM] Fir3#0726
Both cars to gen 2?


[10/02/2021 6:22 PM] Fir3#0726

Seems to be working fine now


[10/02/2021 6:39 PM] apexpool#3878
I have also set Gen2 in bios when I added the 6th card, it did not recognize them all otherwise, and I had kernel panics. since then it is running fine.


[10/02/2021 6:40 PM] Fir3#0726
Now to find the right OC for the 1070ti


[10/02/2021 6:59 PM] andee#4722
I use +200 core, +1500 mem, -mt 0-6


[10/02/2021 7:00 PM] andee#4722
90W PL


[10/02/2021 7:08 PM] Fir3#0726
90w a bit too much


[10/02/2021 7:08 PM] Fir3#0726
I just managed 66mh with 69w


[10/02/2021 7:08 PM] Fir3#0726
Pretty eficient


[10/02/2021 7:09 PM] Fir3#0726
I got can it to 70mhs, 4 mhs for 20w doesn't seem worth it


[10/02/2021 7:10 PM] Fir3#0726
As it stands, I'm using 232Watt for 286Mhs

90W is minimum power limit on linux, mine run at +77


[10/02/2021 7:15 PM] geezar#8187
Never yet managed 69w on a 70ti - minimum was 90w in fact usually closer to 100w - impressive

more efficient that the 80ti running 120 MH/s at 140w

Lock mV


[10/02/2021 7:17 PM] andee#4722
it puts it at about the same efficiency as my 1070, never been able to get the Ti's to match though


[10/02/2021 7:23 PM] Fir3#0726
Gonna try and up the voltage a bit


[10/02/2021 7:24 PM] Fir3#0726
See if it goes up a bit


[10/02/2021 7:26 PM] Fir3#0726
What does the cou consumption amount to in those Linux rigs?


[10/02/2021 7:26 PM] Fir3#0726
Cpu*


[10/02/2021 7:31 PM] apexpool#3878
my rig is using about 40-50w extra to what the GPUs are using.


[10/02/2021 8:20 PM] Fir3#0726
Going out for dinner and can't mess with the 1070ti for now but I managed 71w 69mhs


[10/02/2021 8:20 PM] Fir3#0726
Upped the voltage to 725 mV


[10/02/2021 8:20 PM] Fir3#0726
To support the 800mclock


[10/02/2021 8:21 PM] Fir3#0726
But I think I can do 1000 m lock with some more voltage


[10/02/2021 8:21 PM] Fir3#0726
Needs fine-tuning


[10/02/2021 8:22 PM] andee#4722
are you using memtweak?


[10/02/2021 8:22 PM] Fir3#0726
I'm on trex


[10/02/2021 8:22 PM] Fir3#0726
I do it manually


[10/02/2021 8:22 PM] Fir3#0726
Otherwise it's a mess to lock voltage


[10/02/2021 8:22 PM] andee#4722
how do you change straps manually?


[10/02/2021 8:23 PM] Fir3#0726
Which straps?


[10/02/2021 8:23 PM] Fir3#0726
Trex on windows let's you set everything


[10/02/2021 8:23 PM] andee#4722
```  --mt                       Memory tweak mode (default: 0 - disabled). Range from 0 to 6. General recommendation
                                   is to start with 1, and then increase only if the GPU is stable.
                                   The effect is similar to that of ETHlargementPill.
                                   Supported on Pascal GPUs with GDDR5 or GDDR5X memory only.
                                   Requires running the miner with administrative privileges.
                                   Can be set to a comma separated list to apply different values to different cards.
                                   Example: --mt 4 (applies tweak mode #4 to all cards that support this functionality)
                                            --mt 3,3,3,0 (applies tweak mode #3 to all cards except the last one)```


[10/02/2021 8:23 PM] Fir3#0726

[10/02/2021 8:24 PM] Fir3#0726
But it uses way more energy like that


[10/02/2021 8:24 PM] apexpool#3878
on hiveos, using amdmemtweak for the Vega 56 cards increases the hashrate with about 24 MH/s


[10/02/2021 8:26 PM] Fir3#0726
Different beasts really


[10/02/2021 8:27 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, but it should do something on your cards, too.


[10/02/2021 8:27 PM] andee#4722
I'm at almost 1MH/W on my 1070 using memtweak, it shouldnt be any worse for you


[10/02/2021 8:29 PM] andee#4722
your 69MH/71W is around the same efficiency as mine, a tiny bit better than my 76.33/80W


[10/02/2021 8:33 PM] Fir3#0726
But it's not as good for the 3080


[10/02/2021 8:33 PM] Fir3#0726
But I doubt the memtweak does anything I can't do controlling the voltages


[10/02/2021 8:35 PM] andee#4722
memory timings has nothing to do with voltages. there is a reason bios modding is a thing on amd cards, because tighter timings is beneficial for hashing


[10/02/2021 8:35 PM] andee#4722
for the same reason tighter timings is beneficial for ram on a computer


[10/02/2021 8:41 PM] Fir3#0726
ic


[10/02/2021 8:41 PM] Sojun#9092
higher mem voltage can help with timings/mhz on mem, tho.


[10/02/2021 8:42 PM] Sojun#9092
and with that idea, start with more power on mem, tweak it so it's fast, then lower the power until crash...then bump up a bit


[10/02/2021 8:42 PM] Sojun#9092
then youve got a well oiled mining card so to speak üòÑ (literally if its gigabyte!)


[10/02/2021 8:50 PM] andee#4722
sure, but it wont change timings by itself

Were you able to check that video out?


[10/03/2021 1:19 AM] Fir3#0726
Ok, I managed to use memtweak


[10/03/2021 1:20 AM] Fir3#0726
Had to adjust voltage a bit


[10/03/2021 1:20 AM] Fir3#0726

Has anyone use evga p3 1000w psu? Want to see if anyone had any issue with it


[10/03/2021 7:38 AM] Raul Banea#6094
Anyone here mines with 3060 ti founders ?


[10/03/2021 7:39 AM] Raul Banea#6094
It does not come with lhr ?


[10/03/2021 7:50 AM] apexpool#3878
I don't have one, but I see many being sold on ebay. 3060ti founders edition are non-lhr.


[10/03/2021 7:51 AM] apexpool#3878
and this is why they are usually being sold around 1100 Euro...


[10/03/2021 8:24 AM] Raul Banea#6094
Yea a bit more expensive


[10/03/2021 8:24 AM] Raul Banea#6094
But for ergo mining it is not worth it


[10/03/2021 8:24 AM] Raul Banea#6094
That what i was wondering , from where this price diference


[10/03/2021 10:38 AM] geezar#8187
The 3070 FE is around the same in terms of efficiency - 115-120w on average for 173 MH/s / 63 MH/s ETH - very overpriced IMO now - 60ti still demands a premium when in reality longer term resale with the increased FPS on the 70 technically would be more desirable long term.


[10/03/2021 4:46 PM] miner29#2975
Ive got 10 of these on a friends farm and work solid no issues several years comes with 10 yr warranty would recommend if you can get cheap enough.  Prefer the 1200/1600 w units but only cause more POWER!


[10/03/2021 7:00 PM] SnowPea#7485
Thanks! i was eyeing on the 1000w g2 for lower price with 6 vga ports but that one is out of stock, so the p3 is my next choice


[10/03/2021 7:22 PM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
May I entertain you on server PSU with breakout board?


[10/03/2021 7:24 PM] SnowPea#7485
Haha, im good for now, thank you. I know server psu is much cheaper but i only have a few cards now, dont need something that powerful yet


[10/03/2021 11:36 PM] Minde#4633
Hi All, today I have updated to latest NBMiner version 39.5 and roughly every 10 min i get this "Socket error: The remote host closed the connection Logout" error and miner restarts. Is this something on my end or??

Why dont you use hp server psu?


[10/04/2021 4:16 AM] SnowPea#7485
I keep my rig in my living room, so noise would be an issue. Also, i have a 40% discount on evga site, i need to use it before it expires in early december. I dont think I could get a gpu before that, so I thought I would just get a psu for now, then when I get notified for a gpu, I can still buy it at msrp


[10/04/2021 4:17 AM] ercovero#0957
ive got 2 psu server and make no noise at all


[10/04/2021 4:17 AM] ercovero#0957
the fan never needs to be on


[10/04/2021 4:18 AM] ercovero#0957
ofc, using 3amp on each psu


[10/04/2021 4:18 AM] ercovero#0957
how da hell you will get notified for a gpu


[10/04/2021 4:18 AM] ercovero#0957
elite member or what?


[10/04/2021 4:19 AM] SnowPea#7485
Elite member, just joined earlier this month, but they removed the queue last week


[10/04/2021 4:20 AM] ercovero#0957
are you already been notified?


[10/04/2021 4:20 AM] ercovero#0957
ive been there 2 months and not a single gpu


[10/04/2021 4:20 AM] ercovero#0957
over 18 gpu owned and register


[10/04/2021 4:20 AM] ercovero#0957
just got warranty for 2 evga psu


[10/04/2021 4:21 AM] SnowPea#7485
Wall outlet is another challenge for me, i only have one spot thats good for placing a rig, and that spot only has two wall outlets that supply power to a modem, a router, a hub, a network cloud drive, a printer, an alarm system,  3 monitors and a laptop


[10/04/2021 4:22 AM] ercovero#0957

[10/04/2021 4:22 AM] ercovero#0957
you wanna catch some fire?


[10/04/2021 4:23 AM] SnowPea#7485
No, i only started to queue for a few weeks, i dont think i'll get notified anytime before december (maybe even december 2022 lol)


[10/04/2021 4:23 AM] ercovero#0957
where do you queue?


[10/04/2021 4:23 AM] SnowPea#7485
I only have 3 cards now, should be ok for now


[10/04/2021 4:24 AM] SnowPea#7485
I used the auto notify option on their site

It's a long Q


[10/04/2021 4:26 AM] SnowPea#7485
My rig is only using less than 400w (including other parts of the pc), so at this rate, a 1000w psu should be more than enough for me


[10/04/2021 4:26 AM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
Wait til next year if you just Qed


[10/04/2021 4:27 AM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
Depends on the PSU


[10/04/2021 4:27 AM] SnowPea#7485

You're good!


[10/04/2021 4:29 AM] SnowPea#7485
As for now, im using a 700w and a 650w psu for 3 cards, so if i get a 1000w, i can swap them out for a single psu


[10/04/2021 4:30 AM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
until this hobby becomes a business and you daisy chain the psu

is it better than herominers?


[10/04/2021 11:13 AM] Runstyle#5968
Higher hash= Faster payout. Flypool has more hashrate. But payout amount should be the same


[10/04/2021 11:38 AM] apexpool#3878
are you sure?


[10/04/2021 11:39 AM] Runstyle#5968
@apexpool yeah based from my understanding. i guess i should've included it in my message :MonkaChrist:


[10/04/2021 11:39 AM] apexpool#3878
6.15 TH/s for herominers seems bigger than 1.32 TH/s for flypool @Runstyle


[10/04/2021 11:40 AM] apexpool#3878
and there's also a difference between PPLNS and PROP

ah sorry

ah i mistook FLYPOOL as NANOPOOL. lmao, i stand corrected


[10/04/2021 11:42 AM] Runstyle#5968
as for FlyPool, it takes quite sometime to get payout due to blocktime and poolhashrate. rest assured u still get paid roughly the same

The thing with herominers is that I get an average share rate of 2-4 shares/m


[10/04/2021 11:50 AM] OrangeR#0829
flypool ave 15 s/m

why is that?


[10/04/2021 12:15 PM] Runstyle#5968
@OrangeR It could be what the pool set their "Share difficulty" at... 
maybe flypool is giving u more share difficulty than hero miners

herominers are just to inconsistent with the shares compared to my hash rate


[10/04/2021 1:21 PM] Sazzik#9402
I have a question about the MH/s.
Why does it differ between what my t-rex show on my PC and what the pool website show? T-rex show me 108MH/a and Herominers "Workers" shows 56MH/s...?? How does that work?

really? what region?


[10/04/2021 1:30 PM] andee#4722
flypool uses static diff, herominers vardiff


[10/04/2021 1:33 PM] OrangeR#0829
is that why the pool hash rate so inconsistent


[10/04/2021 1:34 PM] andee#4722
where? current hashrate is just useful as a indicator that your rig is online. look at average


[10/04/2021 1:40 PM] OrangeR#0829
yes sometimes i will get 700mh/s and sometimes 1100mh/s


[10/04/2021 1:48 PM] andee#4722
that's normal. always use average when mining


[10/04/2021 1:49 PM] OrangeR#0829
Well okay then, just looking for the best pool atm but will give both a go

what's the best way to mine eth to buy ergo with, when the network hashrate spikes again and the difficulty follows?

maybe kucoin pool(?) can't seem to find their minimum payout tho


[10/04/2021 6:36 PM] apexpool#3878
what card do you have? the ETH hashrate seems too good compared with the ERG hashrate, I guess.


[10/04/2021 7:07 PM] SnowPea#7485
Im a smaller miner too (420mh on ergo and 130 mh on eth), im planning to go back to nicehash when erg diff spikes again. The main reason is that if i mine eth directly with my hashpower, i wouldnt be able to make the minimum payout (0.01 eth) 2 to 3 days, it'll actually take me 8~10 days to get the minmum payout and not to mention the gas fee when trying to transfer it to and exchange company. With nicehash, i get paid with btc with i can put it directly on coinex and exchange to erg. (it takes about 6 days for my hashrate to get paid in nicehash)


[10/04/2021 7:10 PM] SnowPea#7485
However, i saw some conversation about crypto tax and someone mentioned if i switch to mine eth and buy erg with it, it may trigger two tax events, so there's a chance that i'll get double taxed (but different countries have different tax law, so this may not affect you), so at this moment, im trying to find out how would i be taxed if i mine at nicehash and use that btc to buy erg

thanks @robotü§ñarmpitsüí™


[10/05/2021 12:10 AM] SnowPea#7485
For electricity, you need to look at your electric bill to see what rate plan you are on and if there's different rates when you exceed certain usage level. You can check the pinned oc settings spreadsheet and look for the gpu you are looking to buy and see how much power it consumes. For example if you are planning to get a 3060ti lhr gpu, the average power consumption is about 110~120w, then you can take this wattage, add 50w to it and multipy it by 24, that way you will get an estimate daily usage. Then multiply that by 31 to get a monthly usage and divide it by 1000 to get monthly usage in kw. So in my example, my monthly usage is around 122.4kw. Then multiply it by your electricity rate. Keep in mind that if you are in a tiered rate plan and you are currently on tier 1, you may possibly be going to tier 2 once you start mining


[10/05/2021 12:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
Thanks for the detailed reply! @SnowPea  I appreciate it. 
Why do I need to add 50w to my computation? 

I'm also finding it hard to justify to myself why i should mine erg....why should i when i can just buy directly in the market?


[10/05/2021 12:24 AM] SnowPea#7485
The 50w is for other components on the rig like motherboard, ssd, fans and so on


[10/05/2021 12:27 AM] SnowPea#7485
In terms of why you should or should not mine it, there's no right or wrong answer, to me, its just like some people like to grow their own vegetable, not saying the erg you mined is healthier or something, but for me, i just think mining is interesting, it literally took everything i knew about computer to the next level, so its more of a fun factor for me more than trying to make profit out of it (of course it'll be better if i can make profit lol)


[10/05/2021 12:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
Fair enough, I do have that interest as well so sure...I know it will be fun. but it would be great if it were profitable AND fun. 

I suppose if ERG price goes up a certain value then it will become highly profitable. Add the fact that it is ASIC resistant now then this means less time for it to be difficult to mine like btc?

[10/05/2021 2:45 AM] SnowPea#7485
I guess its the efficiency, the cost of a 3080 is more than three 3060/3060ti and the hashrate is not 3 times more than them

Not sure about hive but it should allow you to ssh onto the actual rig - then running the miner to open up the actual miner to display what its hashing + the core clocks (not the set ones in the console)


[10/05/2021 2:59 PM] geezar#8187
Monster GPU's - your seeing really low power on them - I tested ETH and the 280w got old quick... as did the huge spikes in power up and down...

Big fan of those 3GB 1060's I had the P106's + some other non mining GPU's - great hash - sure the PL could be clocked lower around 60 maybe but hard limit on the P106's I recal


[10/05/2021 3:02 PM] geezar#8187
325/1400/75 with --mt 4 or 5 I think gave 55-59 MH/s - for what they are and $100 - great buy

mem tweak was a well known parameter to many TBH can't take any credit for that - messing with the intensity and mt settings (T-Rex/NB) always worth a look at too. 
1.2 GH/s then on ERGO assuming an average of 55 MH/s per GPU
1650w (reported)
Typical buy in USD say $100 a piece $2,200


[10/05/2021 3:42 PM] geezar#8187

$932 per month yield at such low market price + the lower diff ofc. not bad - work out your power costs from that 1650w still a nice profit I would think


[10/05/2021 3:45 PM] geezar#8187
3-4 Month ROI - realistically this could extend to 5-6 but not bad for what they are inc $800 budget for PSU etc + misc parts - Per GPU ROI 2-3 months (broadly speaking on a basis of $1.41 base yield on 55 MH/s) but when you stack up the other costs longer clearly

@WeeklyOptions do you have molex to plug into mother board as well (one closest to cpu)?  do you have a momentary switch hooked up to the power on pins?  or is this video when you hit it you get that?


[10/05/2021 8:53 PM] WeeklyOptions#5401
Yeah the video is when I hit the power button for the MOBO that‚Äôs what happens


[10/05/2021 8:56 PM] miner29#2975
that generally indicates a short state.  the psu is shutting back down.  Do you have a regular atx to confirm if its mobo or psu....ie stick an atx just to see if it spin up..if it does then its something with breakout/hp psu...if it doesnt then you know to look at mobo/cpu/ram/ shorting to ground etc.


[10/05/2021 8:56 PM] WeeklyOptions#5401
Figured it out


[10/05/2021 8:56 PM] miner29#2975

Hello everyone, I am new to this channel and I would like to start mining Ergo with 6 x RX 570 4gb, can anyone please share how much coins would that setup get in a month?


[10/05/2021 11:32 PM] ercovero#0957
about 16 ergo


[10/05/2021 11:33 PM] ercovero#0957
but it can be more or less, the dificulty has been moving so much


[10/05/2021 11:42 PM] Deksa#0709
16 with 6 cards? That is low :(


[10/06/2021 12:02 AM] Dv#3650
What's the MH for a 570

[10/06/2021 12:35 AM] ercovero#0957
get 6 3080ti and you will get 16 every week


[10/06/2021 12:35 AM] ercovero#0957
55 ms


[10/06/2021 12:35 AM] ercovero#0957
and ergo is the best algo for 570 4gb


[10/06/2021 12:35 AM] ercovero#0957
i rather sell them and get all the 3060 ti to msrp that  i could get


[10/06/2021 12:36 AM] ercovero#0957
there you can see every gpu and his profit by day


[10/06/2021 1:46 AM] Isoxls#1260
people in telegram have been saying 570 can do higher than 55 w polaris mod


[10/06/2021 1:46 AM] Isoxls#1260
8gb


[10/06/2021 1:47 AM] Isoxls#1260
i have an armor one w samsung mem it does 55 tho id like to tweak it


[10/06/2021 5:13 AM] Dv#3650
Yea good luck, the MH per $ on 3080tis even at msrp is about twice as expensive as used 570s


[10/06/2021 6:04 AM] WeeklyOptions#5401
Hmm


[10/06/2021 2:06 PM] andee#4722
65-72


[10/06/2021 2:24 PM] geezar#8187
All Polaris from 470's will achieve as Andee suggests


[10/06/2021 2:27 PM] geezar#8187
Good place to start is around 1150/1950/850 if the mv will hold. BIOS modding will unleash the hash and will give you around 60-70 MH/s with reported power anywhere between 45w to 80w but at the wall 100-110w range (4GB Polaris)


[10/06/2021 2:27 PM] geezar#8187
Higher core of 1200-1275 - will get you high 60's for sure


[10/06/2021 2:31 PM] ozyw#4076
Rx 570 does about 60-62 with elpida at 85-90W from the wall. The hynix does about 59-60, with bios mods and all tweaks.


[10/06/2021 2:37 PM] geezar#8187
Never had any polaris that would not do 70 - Elpida, Samsung, Hynix and Micron


[10/06/2021 2:37 PM] apexpool#3878
how do you do BIOS modding?


[10/06/2021 2:38 PM] geezar#8187
Same as straps on your vegas but you apply the strap to the bios, replacing the one on the GPU

[10/06/2021 2:41 PM] apexpool#3878
so you download the bios image, you edit it with this program, and then flash the new one?


[10/06/2021 2:41 PM] apexpool#3878
like chiptuning for cars?


[10/06/2021 2:42 PM] geezar#8187
You need to extract the bios on the GPU - this can them be moddifed (many settings but most common are the mem straps - copying the straps from 1750 up being common place)


[10/06/2021 2:42 PM] geezar#8187
Yes same principle - so instead of changing cam timing, boost, fuel duty on the injectors etc


[10/06/2021 2:42 PM] geezar#8187
You then upload back to the GPU


[10/06/2021 2:43 PM] geezar#8187
Best practice is to extract the BIOS safe.. and be cautious of any changes DYOR üôÇ


[10/06/2021 2:44 PM] geezar#8187
Lots of content on YT https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=BIOS+MOD+POLARIS


[10/06/2021 2:44 PM] apexpool#3878
I guess for Vegas is safe, because they have 2 BIOS images


[10/06/2021 2:45 PM] geezar#8187
So you would not edit the BIOS on the Vega, you apply the mem straps via the tweak tool - same principle - in fact you can do the same for Polaris too (without needing to bios mod the BIOS) - so probably safer üôÇ


[10/06/2021 2:45 PM] geezar#8187
Many of the linux distro's have embeded this tool (--REF 30) but background reading check out

I noticed that the power cap is different for my Vega cards


[10/06/2021 2:46 PM] apexpool#3878
even for the same card between the 2 positions


[10/06/2021 2:46 PM] apexpool#3878
I guess this can be altered if you edit the bios and flash it again


[10/06/2021 2:47 PM] geezar#8187
Sounds like your on a mission Apex - the Mem tweak tool will allow you to do this but without the danger (reboot and will be removed)


[10/06/2021 2:47 PM] apexpool#3878
I am using amdmemtweak, it has big influence on hashrate

100% makes total sense never had them stable at 800 damn impressive


[10/06/2021 3:55 PM] ozyw#4076
800 only for the elpida, for the hynjx 820


[10/06/2021 3:56 PM] ozyw#4076
Elpida for me it's the best performer and at lower power. Samsung it's sometimes worse than hynix for some reason


[10/06/2021 4:02 PM] geezar#8187
Same, Samsung are silly - even 893 I've found problems with only 1150 core - nice and low power for sure on your Elpidas

hey, does someone know how the counter from gpu 0 - 3 works on a pcie quad adapter?


[10/06/2021 4:15 PM] WINNI#3324
like is the first on the slot on the top or the one from the bottom


[10/06/2021 5:10 PM] miner29#2975
@WINNI usually the one closest to the slot is 1st on the 1-4 pcie splitter board.  Then 2 is right above it 3 is on top and 4 is on top closest to the back metal slot cover.  It can vary but all of mine are in that form


[10/06/2021 5:11 PM] miner29#2975

I guess you can start without the rig.conf file if you think it causes problems


[10/07/2021 5:59 AM] apexpool#3878
or with a new image of hiveos written on the usb stick


[10/07/2021 6:00 AM] Attila#3944
That‚Äôs the plan, I actually ordered an ssd-usb adapter, coming tomorrow, I‚Äôll just go that route


[10/07/2021 6:01 AM] apexpool#3878
I would get the smallest M.2 SSD possible for my rig, if I wanted to use different storage.


[10/07/2021 6:01 AM] apexpool#3878
the mainboard has 2 slots for M.2 SSD


[10/07/2021 6:12 AM] Attila#3944

I just need a usb adapter so that I can flash it on my mac


[10/07/2021 6:13 AM] apexpool#3878
I see. Why don't you try with a USB stick? you need a 8 GB stick.


[10/07/2021 6:13 AM] apexpool#3878
this is what I am using.


[10/07/2021 6:13 AM] apexpool#3878
actually upgraded to 16 GB, but only 8 GB are allocated.


[10/07/2021 6:14 AM] Attila#3944
But there you‚Äôre stuck with the stick always being stuck into the rig, aren‚Äôt you?


[10/07/2021 6:14 AM] apexpool#3878
yes. but it's cheaper and easier to update.


[10/07/2021 6:15 AM] apexpool#3878
or troubleshoot.


[10/07/2021 6:15 AM] Attila#3944
That‚Äôs true. Lesson learned, though I hope when I can make this work I won‚Äôt need to operate out the ssds anytime soon üôÇ


[10/07/2021 6:16 AM] apexpool#3878
yes, if you make it work, you probably do not need to work with the ssds.


[10/07/2021 6:17 AM] apexpool#3878
but until you have your adapter, you can still test with a USB stick - I assume you have one you can delete temporarily

as opposed to AMD cards, my 1060 doubles in hashrate during new blocks


[10/07/2021 8:12 AM] Ananas#9063
the GPU going idle 77 times overnight probably has something to do with it :thonk:


[10/07/2021 8:32 AM] trex#6765
unreal hashrate is a known bug but hopefully will be fixed in the next version


[10/07/2021 8:32 AM] Ananas#9063
I see, thanks!


[10/07/2021 9:18 AM] Attila#3944
I got myself 2 pendrives, I etched Hiveos on one of them and it bricked the drive immedieately - made it read only, couldn't even add a rig.conf


[10/07/2021 9:18 AM] Attila#3944
I'll try with the other one at home with my windows device


[10/07/2021 9:18 AM] Attila#3944

[10/07/2021 9:29 AM] Attila#3944
I ordered 12 cards, when I went to collect the store manager said they're only allowed to give out 3 on each invoice so they have to cancel my order, still haven't got my 9k eur back


[10/07/2021 9:30 AM] Attila#3944
I bought 5 yesterday and I can still make some money available but you know at this point I'd like to see my investment working for me


[10/07/2021 9:30 AM] apexpool#3878
yes, completely understandable


[10/07/2021 9:31 AM] Attila#3944
Also, the insanity, I mean nothing stopped me from putting 12 cards into my cart and paying upfront


[10/07/2021 9:32 AM] Attila#3944
and when I go there they're like "you're a miner! you can't do this! but we can split it into 4 bills with 3 each and you can take it rn"


[10/07/2021 9:32 AM] Attila#3944
as if everyone had an extra 9k laying around


[10/07/2021 9:34 AM] apexpool#3878
they are probably somehow verified, I guess, but not thoroughly.


[10/07/2021 9:34 AM] apexpool#3878
if they do that.


[10/07/2021 9:48 AM] Attila#3944
It's not illegal by any means, so I don't understand what's going on


[10/07/2021 9:48 AM] Attila#3944
but in any case, how should this be my inconvenience?


[10/07/2021 9:48 AM] Attila#3944
at this point they have 12.5k euros from me and I only have 5 3060tis


[10/07/2021 9:49 AM] Attila#3944
and the guy shouted with me in store


[10/07/2021 9:49 AM] Attila#3944
basically how dare I order 12 cards


[10/07/2021 9:54 AM] Dv#3650
Should've got them on separate invoices, if they offered? @Attila


[10/07/2021 10:04 AM] woundedgoat#1454
Report them to Nvidia and say you did not know that you couldn‚Äôt buy 12 cards.
At the end of the day they took the order, took the funds from you, that‚Äôs a contract. How the fuck they can insult you for an error they made is beyond me.


[10/07/2021 10:05 AM] woundedgoat#1454
Get your refund, then go into the store, approach the person who was rude to you. Read out the email you will send to Nvidia to him, then say ‚Äúsend‚Äù and walk away


[10/07/2021 10:38 AM] Attila#3944
Yes, but I had paid by bank transfer and that has to be sent back - I don't have an extra 9k lying around


[10/07/2021 10:38 AM] Attila#3944
still haven't got the money back btw


[10/07/2021 10:38 AM] Attila#3944
I wrote to the managing director of the company on linkedin, he apologized and will look into what's going on


[10/07/2021 10:39 AM] woundedgoat#1454
Good for you, that staff members needs sacking


[10/07/2021 10:40 AM] Attila#3944
I suspect that there are store rules in place whereby stores are not allowed to sell cards to insiders in bulk. But nowadays cards are not scarce, albeit they sell them at scalper prices. So what happened is that I ordered 12 MSI cards from the webshop with instore pickup, and 2 days later I changed the order to 4x asus and 8x zotac cause they had just got listed at a substantially lower price, and the customer service guy changed the order for me over the phone


[10/07/2021 10:41 AM] Attila#3944
His name showed up on the order memo and I suspect the store manager thought that the CS guy was using the store as a pickup point for an insider deal with me as the courier


[10/07/2021 10:41 AM] Attila#3944
He literally told me to not try to think he's so stupid


[10/07/2021 10:42 AM] Attila#3944
and eventually I showed him the original order and the email communication we had with company central


[10/07/2021 10:42 AM] Attila#3944
which is when he changed his tone and said that I could take the cards 3 per invoice if I want immediately


[10/07/2021 10:43 AM] Attila#3944
So TLDR guy must have thought I'm playing company rules and went turbo police


[10/07/2021 10:57 AM] Ananas#9063
even if you were playing company rules he has no right to demean you or raise his tone, report that guy to the company


[10/07/2021 10:58 AM] Ananas#9063

Yes


[10/07/2021 3:46 PM] andee#4722
then double check the driver. GA104 was what it said for me until I had a new enough driver


[10/07/2021 3:47 PM] andee#4722
first install failed when using flashdrive


[10/07/2021 3:47 PM] andee#4722
you need to expand filesystem to have enough space for the install


[10/07/2021 3:47 PM] andee#4722
`disk-expand`


[10/07/2021 3:50 PM] Attila#3944
ah cool


[10/07/2021 3:50 PM] Attila#3944
that looks reasonable


[10/07/2021 3:50 PM] Attila#3944
thanks, will try


[10/07/2021 3:50 PM] Attila#3944
`disk-expand` and then `nvidia-update-driver`?


[10/07/2021 3:50 PM] andee#4722
yep, might have to do a reboot after expanding. not sure about that one


[10/07/2021 3:51 PM] andee#4722
I think install was "successful" for me even if there wasn't enough space, so it might have fooled you too


[10/07/2021 3:51 PM] Attila#3944
yes, that might be the case


[10/07/2021 3:53 PM] Attila#3944

there is /var/log/syslog, and I believe you can also configure other logs, but I did not do it, since I am using a USB stick.


[10/08/2021 9:23 AM] Dv#3650

[10/08/2021 9:23 AM] apexpool#3878
for /var/log/syslog you have to login with ssh, I assume. this is what I am doing.


[10/08/2021 9:24 AM] apexpool#3878
for the others... I don't know, since I don't have them, but I would assume yes.

@trex trex keeps restarting, is there anyway to see what's causing this to happen on hiveos?


[10/09/2021 7:15 AM] apexpool#3878
```tail -f /var/log/miner/t-rex/t-rex.log 
```


[10/09/2021 7:15 AM] apexpool#3878
it will show you the output from t-rex, just like watching it on your monitor.


[10/09/2021 7:21 AM] Dv#3650
I figured it out, was able to download all the logs and see@apexpool


[10/09/2021 7:22 AM] Dv#3650
GPU 0 was causing a cuda error

I just bought gpurisers because I want to replace my cheap alibaba ones that failed. What is the best to replace? Should I get replace all risers in one shot? And then boot up my mining rig? What do you guys think?


[10/09/2021 2:38 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, replace all.


[10/09/2021 3:22 PM] enricoxg#4264
Should I replace one by one? Then boot up rig? Or replace all of them and then boot up rig


[10/09/2021 3:22 PM] apexpool#3878
I would replace them all once.

ofc, each card is different, so it can be tweaked but it should be a good baseline

it might be because of the Vega64... when I change something at one card, the other is also influenced, I guess Team Red Miner has some issues...


[10/09/2021 8:06 PM] apexpool#3878
lower the core clock


[10/09/2021 8:06 PM] Terremot#4855
I'll use the same settings on the 64


[10/09/2021 8:06 PM] Terremot#4855
and see what happens


[10/09/2021 8:07 PM] apexpool#3878
and connect with ssh to hiveos and run "amd-info" to see the clocks and power usage


[10/09/2021 8:08 PM] apexpool#3878
I am setting core voltage to 793 instead of 800, because with 800 sometimes it increases to 835 and the power usage increases a lot.

I was hoping to get some help from someone..... I'd like to setup my 3060's to mine Ergo through Hiveos. Am I able to run them at full hash rate on a a motherboard with pcie 8/16 lanes with riser or is it like ETH and i can't mine on full hash rate on pcie 8/16 pcie with riser?   I have 4 non LHR, version 1 asus 3060, I get full hash rate when theyre are pluged directly into the motherboard on a pcie16 lane but its not cost effective to run them on 4 PC"s. I appreciate all the help and my apologies if this question has already been addressed.


[10/10/2021 1:44 AM] Salu#0001
is 600 usd a decent price for the going rate for a vega 64?


[10/10/2021 3:23 AM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
On Windows, they get full hash rate even with 1x PCIE

every card will have the full hashrate on 1x, no matter what OS you are using. don't avoid linux for that reason.

TL-WN822N (not sure if there are multiple versions)

is a bit bigger, but again plug and play


[10/10/2021 5:26 PM] Herk#6019
or find one you like and google it, see what chip it has, avoid ones like the RTL8821XX since they'll most likely need a driver compiled for your kernel


[10/10/2021 5:29 PM] geezar#8187
Try to avoid Wi-Fi 100% but I did pick up some generic ones from Ali-express for around $1 a piece.. alarmingly once you locate the driver (usually on a china FTP link sourced from much searching...) worked perfectly (this was on Windows 10) never tried on Linux TBH - less hassle I would stick with branded items but the generic ones have been fine


[10/10/2021 5:34 PM] apexpool#3878

[10/10/2021 5:51 PM] Herk#6019
much easier to expand as well with less cables, it's pretty reliable if done properly, guess you could alternatively get a usb to ethernet adapter and still be able to disable the onboard ethernet port üòÑ


[10/10/2021 5:56 PM] apexpool#3878
why disable onboard adapter, is it also using a pci express lane?

everything is

still need to find some time to see how many lanes disabling usb gets you


[10/10/2021 5:57 PM] Herk#6019
I bet some boards use more than 1 lane for usb

[10/11/2021 5:44 AM] MylesAbove#3307
i noticed on my cards - 3060Ti LHR (samsung mem): If i set the offset core of -625 they work well and run at around 900MHz core clock, but if I try to lock the core clock at 900 they don't utilise all the PL ive set? locking core clock uses less power?


[10/11/2021 7:19 AM] Wii#9265
Hey so I was wondering a thing. i mine at herominers, and yes, I know decentralisation but I only mine parttime with one card so sue me. Anyways when I mine it says difficulty 4G. Then someday my GPU out of luck found a 6T share, and then the min. difficulty skyrocketed to 16G. Is that a coincidence or result of the luck?


[10/11/2021 8:15 AM] apexpool#3878

Hi, want to start mining for ERGO. I read instructions. Unfortunately, I dont have any space in apartment for installing so I want to rent a server with Vultr. 1. Can I do it? 2. For mining do we need specifically vRAM or RAM would be the same? Thank you


[10/11/2021 11:37 AM] apexpool#3878
you will not be able to mine on a rented server. you need GPUs to mine.


[10/11/2021 11:39 AM] geezar#8187
@Nutopia instead of using a VPS and a GPU (very expensive) consider renting hash, NH or MMR are good options

[10/11/2021 9:54 PM] SnowPea#7485
Never used one before but according to the spreadsheet in the pinned message, 5700 is only about 10~20mh lower than 3060 v2 with the same power consumption, if you can get them at such a low price, it looks like a good deal to me

card 0 is 3060ti, cards 1, 2 and 3 are 3070ti


[10/12/2021 8:24 AM] apexpool#3878
and this is in the overclocking settings for them:

[10/12/2021 8:24 AM] apexpool#3878
I have more than 20 flight sheets now, I'm testing many settings


[10/12/2021 8:25 AM] woundedgoat#1454
What are you managing to get on 3070ti‚Äôs


[10/12/2021 8:25 AM] apexpool#3878
174-175 with this.


[10/12/2021 8:25 AM] woundedgoat#1454
Awesome work, I‚Äôm going to tinker a lot today


[10/12/2021 8:25 AM] apexpool#3878
but they can do 180 with different settings, but more power.

3500 for memory clock and higher power limit


[10/12/2021 8:26 AM] apexpool#3878
what cards do you have @woundedgoat ?


[10/12/2021 8:27 AM] woundedgoat#1454
I have 33 total. I‚Äôm getting around 179 with most already, 3070tis that is. I do have 3 3070ti FE that only get 156 though


[10/12/2021 8:28 AM] apexpool#3878
mine are 3070ti FE


[10/12/2021 8:28 AM] apexpool#3878
so the settings should help


[10/12/2021 8:32 AM] woundedgoat#1454
Thanks I am going to try them out, we thinking that around 180 is max regardless of auto tune on any LHR 3070ti, no matter the make model of the GPU


[10/12/2021 8:33 AM] apexpool#3878
probably, I could not get anything more with lhr unlock on them, only less üòÇ


[10/12/2021 8:33 AM] apexpool#3878
but lhr unlock works very well on 3060ti with Samsung memory.


[10/12/2021 8:34 AM] woundedgoat#1454
That‚Äôs good to know, how about Hynix? Would this cause that a failure for the GPU to work?


[10/12/2021 8:34 AM] woundedgoat#1454
Because I just set one rig to it and it won‚Äôt do anything lol


[10/12/2021 8:34 AM] apexpool#3878
I don't have Hynix memory on other cards than a Vega 56. but other people tried and 0 results.


[10/12/2021 8:35 AM] apexpool#3878
for now only Samsunt, as trex said on the other channel.

Ok so it‚Äôs not liking that 93 setting on Hynix at all, just won‚Äôt post at all. I think I‚Äôm going to be having a day of switching cards around my rigs


[10/12/2021 8:41 AM] apexpool#3878
I guess having identical cards (or at least with the same memory) on the same rig is the way to go.


[10/12/2021 8:42 AM] woundedgoat#1454

[10/12/2021 8:51 AM] andee#4722
need to hold on it a little, should work. I only use phone to check stats though, configuring rig would be a nightmare


[10/12/2021 8:52 AM] apexpool#3878
it is on by default. you just start t-rex 0.24.2 without parameters and it is active, I think.


[10/12/2021 8:52 AM] woundedgoat#1454
I updated to it and everything is exactly the same. No card any different in terms of MH/S

Yes, quite a few


[10/12/2021 8:54 AM] apexpool#3878
it is working for me, I tested yesterday, but from command line, because I was already using t-rex in hiveos for the 3070ti cards.


[10/12/2021 8:55 AM] apexpool#3878
but the best results I had without auto-tune mode, just testing different lhr values until I found the one working

@woundedgoat you have your Gigabyte/Samsung 3060ti cards set with different (lower) core clock. can you try 1485 or 1500?


[10/12/2021 9:02 AM] woundedgoat#1454
Yeah ill try, they are so picky though. Get GPU not found errors a lot when i change them for some reason


[10/12/2021 9:02 AM] apexpool#3878
I am half on woolypooly and half on flypool, compensating this way for pool luck.


[10/12/2021 9:03 AM] woundedgoat#1454
Didn‚Äôt think to split, ill give that a go, its just when the difficulty hit around 4.9, i was barely cutting even on other pools


[10/12/2021 9:03 AM] apexpool#3878
how much is your electricity?


[10/12/2021 9:04 AM] Herk#6019
I try to squeeze as many cards as possible in one system, you could easily get 12 in 1


[10/12/2021 9:04 AM] Herk#6019
that‚Äôs some less W and $ paid to hiveos


[10/12/2021 9:04 AM] woundedgoat#1454
$0.26 and will be hitting $0.34 next month when my current 2 year deal ends


[10/12/2021 9:05 AM] apexpool#3878
still cheaper than mine, I'm paying now about 0.32 Euro per kwh, and increasing slowly üò¢

[10/12/2021 9:06 AM] apexpool#3878
I like the Vega 56 cards, 3rd coming in 1-2 days, but I guess it will also be the last one. they are using more power.


[10/12/2021 9:06 AM] woundedgoat#1454
I only have the one rig that could take 12 cards sadly


[10/12/2021 9:06 AM] apexpool#3878
if I buy more, I should only buy 3060ti cards.


[10/12/2021 9:07 AM] woundedgoat#1454
I‚Äôm finding the 3080ti‚Äôs are good for power/mhs ratio


[10/12/2021 9:08 AM] woundedgoat#1454
But power draw is a major concern going forward thats for sure, i am trying my hardest to not sell any ERG that i mine

lower the power limit I guess


[10/12/2021 9:22 AM] apexpool#3878
or is it already at the minimum possible?


[10/12/2021 9:22 AM] woundedgoat#1454
Have you ever found that if you lower the power limit you get overclock errors? I was getting them at one point


[10/12/2021 9:22 AM] woundedgoat#1454
It‚Äôs set at 125w


[10/12/2021 9:23 AM] woundedgoat#1454
But runs at 100w


[10/12/2021 9:24 AM] apexpool#3878
with older versions ot t-rex, I was setting the power limit to 100w to avoid lhr kick-in. and temperature had to be 56c or higher for the same reason.


[10/12/2021 9:25 AM] Herk#6019
yours runs at 150mhs right?


[10/12/2021 9:25 AM] apexpool#3878
now it works with lower temperatures and higher power limits.


[10/12/2021 9:25 AM] apexpool#3878
153-155 MH/s with the latest t-rex.


[10/12/2021 9:26 AM] woundedgoat#1454
We can‚Äôt get any improvement in Hynix though can we?


[10/12/2021 9:26 AM] Herk#6019
damn that's basically another 150mhs right there


[10/12/2021 9:27 AM] woundedgoat#1454
What MEM do you use on the gigabyte Samsung‚Äôs?


[10/12/2021 9:27 AM] apexpool#3878
nothing for the moment. I guess about 137 MH/s is the best you can get for now.

sounds like you have some work to do @woundedgoat


[10/12/2021 9:30 AM] woundedgoat#1454
Yeah I do haha, I think first port of call is to reconfigure the cards into the rigs. Seems like my Hynix cards don‚Äôt want anything to do with auto tune


[10/12/2021 9:47 AM] woundedgoat#1454
Hey @apexpool quick question what version on the Nvidia drivers are you running? And do you update the bios on your cards?


[10/12/2021 9:48 AM] apexpool#3878

I did not update bios on any card so far.

the cards behaves like it is a non-lhr card, very stable, but with poor performance.

and when LHR kicks in, usually kernel panic and I have to reboot. happened a few times yesterday.


[10/13/2021 11:52 AM] Attila#3944
Yep, exactly


[10/13/2021 12:06 PM] andee#4722
never got kernel panics, haven't tested tuning on the driver I am using now though

what settings are you using, if that's a Hynix? I see that you are using t-rex 0.24.0

upgraded driver and t-rex at the same time, so not sure what caused it but guessing its the driver. were using t-rex 0.21.6 before the upgrade üòÑ


[10/13/2021 12:38 PM] apexpool#3878
what driver?


[10/13/2021 12:38 PM] andee#4722
the gpu is still running P2, so I guess the higher core combined with PL stops the memory from boosting and causing memory error


[10/13/2021 12:38 PM] andee#4722
470.74

upgrading now the driver...


[10/13/2021 12:41 PM] andee#4722
were using 465.31 in the beginning, then lost a little speed by upgrading driver and miner


[10/13/2021 12:44 PM] apexpool#3878
so better try 465.31?


[10/13/2021 12:55 PM] andee#4722
try both üôÇ its not like a massive amount lost on the newer driver, the card is still stable +- .4


[10/13/2021 12:56 PM] apexpool#3878
is it normal too take a long time to change the driver in hiveos?


[10/13/2021 12:56 PM] andee#4722
if using usb flash drive it can be problematic


[10/13/2021 12:56 PM] apexpool#3878
I've been waiting for more than 10 minutes


[10/13/2021 12:57 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, flash drive, should be usb3, but who knows


[10/13/2021 12:57 PM] andee#4722
I am using old harddrives on usb sata, and one ssd. tried flash drive but it became annoying because of needs to reflash and sticks dying


[10/13/2021 12:57 PM] apexpool#3878
I'm seeing progress now


[10/13/2021 12:59 PM] apexpool#3878
I guess at some point I'll switch to M.2 ssd, I have 2 slots on-board.


[10/13/2021 1:02 PM] Attila#3944
M2 ssd is awesome


[10/13/2021 1:02 PM] Attila#3944

yes, for sure they are.


[10/13/2021 1:10 PM] apexpool#3878
but it would fit so well on the mainboard, no need for extra cables or place to mount the sata hdd üòÇ I guess I know what I'll buy for black friday


[10/13/2021 1:10 PM] apexpool#3878
the cheapest M.2 ssd possible

tried to get that to 150?


[10/13/2021 1:47 PM] andee#4722
nope, might try later. last time I tried to get more speed the card never went above 116W even with 135W PL

Samsung 3060ti is poor for ergo while it gives 45mh in ETH so hynix is good so far

with trex 0.24.2 3060ti lhr can achieve 161 mhs ergo by tuning 93

Easier on Windows to determine - there are a lot of indicators using a few tools to determine

[10/13/2021 9:16 PM] Attila#3944

[10/13/2021 9:29 PM] geezar#8187
Suggest you dial those in and we can share how we get on lhr 90 upwards - problem is the PL - way too high... but a start


[10/13/2021 9:29 PM] SnowPea#7485
Do you lock the core?


[10/13/2021 9:29 PM] geezar#8187
no locked core at the moment until we dial it in

not yet


[10/13/2021 9:30 PM] geezar#8187
offset only (until we do more testing)


[10/13/2021 9:30 PM] SnowPea#7485
Ok, let me try too


[10/13/2021 9:30 PM] geezar#8187

‚Äúlhr-tune‚Äù: ‚Äú0 93 75 0‚Äù for example where  the numbers are the setting for each card. So if you have 4 cards of which you want to set the first to off, the second and third to 90 and the fourth to 75, you would write ‚Äúlhr-tune‚Äù: ‚Äú0, 90, 90, 75‚Äù


[10/14/2021 6:51 AM] MangDefi#4978
I think it's not real hashrate yet. The miner said 160 mhs, but the pool said average only 125 mhs. I'll wait for the fix, back to nbminer at real 147 mhs for now.

üëç 

[10/14/2021 7:36 AM] trex#6765
The hashrate reported by the miner should be "real" unless there's a bug.
Could you please run the miner with `-l trex.log` , PM me a link to your pool's dashboard, and then we can check it against the log file after the miner's found at least 3k-5k shares?


[10/14/2021 8:48 AM] geezar#8187
@MangDefi thanks for coming back to us - personal testing has shown 151 MH/s but at very high power. To achieve your 160 MH/s is staggering üëç


[10/14/2021 8:49 AM] geezar#8187
Prior to this Hynix achieved 136 MH/s at peak but usually fell to around 133-134


[10/14/2021 8:52 AM] andee#4722
8451 memclock is quite wicked. thats 401 over my current clock. platinum silicon ü§£


[10/14/2021 8:55 AM] andee#4722
what clocks did you run for 151MH?


[10/14/2021 9:32 AM] geezar#8187
Testing again now - offset only no locked core but it was silly high PL 150 - also -500/2000/150 lhr 92


[10/14/2021 9:32 AM] geezar#8187
no way my mem freaks out 7800... lol if you have a good GPU maybe you can hit those numbers lol


[10/14/2021 9:35 AM] andee#4722
have you been watching the clocks when trying to maximize it? what I saw was that it was stable at e.g 7850, but if I increased it to 7900 it suddenly started boosting memclock randomly causing memory error and miner restart


[10/14/2021 9:36 AM] geezar#8187
7800 and above does not play ball

I was not able to get the card to draw more than 116W the last time I tried the unlocker ü§î  ran 1600 core, 2500 mem and 135W PL

Thanks. I will try it. Your miner really amazing for this lhr card, stable at 160 mhs for hours. I don't know why Leafpool reports average hashrate is only 125 mhs. I'll pm you.


[10/14/2021 12:59 PM] MangDefi#4978

Max I can achieve is 2300 mem and it fails - that is a Hynix GPU @MangDefi ?


[10/14/2021 2:11 PM] Attila#3944
mclock +1650 would be 3300 on hiveos?


[10/14/2021 2:37 PM] geezar#8187
Yep - would need to test the same on Windows, same driver and same clocks - no where near on Linux 2200 max

Chasing that hash got my Hynix stable at 146 so was worth spending the time chasing lol

I still couldnt get pass 132 on windows lol and i almost thought i broke my cards because even my 3060ti lhr and 3060 started throwing invalid shares and miner restarted a few times due to illegal memory


[10/14/2021 6:30 PM] SnowPea#7485
The thing is that i didnt change any settings on the 3060

I was able to go close to 160 with Samsung, but Hinyx is stubborn.

just above 134.


[10/14/2021 6:58 PM] Canberry#7404
what are people doing with v2 3060s here? im getting 108MH at 89w on trex without any LHR stuff


[10/14/2021 6:58 PM] Canberry#7404
on NBminer and trex with LHR modes i tend to lose hash


[10/14/2021 7:04 PM] FlyingPig#2854
How do you get 133 on Hynix? (hiveos)?


[10/14/2021 7:11 PM] apexpool#3878
yes


[10/14/2021 7:18 PM] FlyingPig#2854
Which miner and what settings? I can only get 120 using any miner. 1000 core and 1600 mem (hiveos)


[10/14/2021 7:25 PM] apexpool#3878
wait a moment


[10/14/2021 7:25 PM] geezar#8187
`**Hynix** 3060ti 
1400-1500 Core
No offset
2000-2200 Mem 
PL 120-125
--LHR 90-96 
Driver 470.74
Linux
T-Rex 24.2
Lots of testing is needed but as above will yield 140-145 MH/s .. each GPU is different so take these as the basis for your own testing ofc.`

Pure ETH same GPU 42.5 MHS/s  119w - more profit in ETH currently but hashes OK for what it is - dual 21 MH/s ETH/82 MH/s ERGO - Hynix

[10/15/2021 12:16 AM] Fabio1402#4525
my 3060tis will not go above 120MH on ergo! any ideas! tried many many many many over clock settings, is there something else i need to look at


[10/15/2021 1:33 AM] Canberry#7404
thanks, gonna try that out tonight


[10/15/2021 6:49 AM] Paktra#9695
Can anybody walk me through setting my NBMiner? I can't get mine to run. Currently operating Nanominer on Windows.


[10/15/2021 8:04 AM] apexpool#3878
Samsung or Hynix? Any of them should go easily over 130, and Samsung over 155.


[10/15/2021 8:47 AM] geezar#8187
Hynix stable at lhr 96 seems - 119w - high but best I can find so far

[10/15/2021 8:49 AM] apexpool#3878
mine is running without issues with LHR 100
```GPU #0: RTX 3060 Ti - 133.71 MH/s, [LHR 100<>] [T:52C, P:114W, F:55%, E:1.17MH/W], 1/1 R:0% I:0%
```


[10/15/2021 8:49 AM] apexpool#3878
but lower hashrate...


[10/15/2021 8:49 AM] apexpool#3878
1320 / 2300 / 115W


[10/15/2021 8:53 AM] geezar#8187
Same up until locked core of 1100 - then LHR kicks in


[10/15/2021 8:54 AM] geezar#8187
Same as 70ti - I run -550/1590/3000 for 176 MH/s but only stable at 145 PL - no where near as low as 131w - happy its hashing and stable üëç

[10/15/2021 8:55 AM] andee#4722
same thing happened for me ü§î


[10/15/2021 8:56 AM] geezar#8187
Samsung - did you try those clocks to get to 160 MH/s Apex?


[10/15/2021 8:56 AM] geezar#8187
Must be variants in the BIOS revision on the Hynix GPUs


[10/15/2021 8:57 AM] geezar#8187
over a week to get it stable at those clocks - leaving it well alone... 135 was max for many days that said


[10/15/2021 9:00 AM] apexpool#3878
I did get 160 a few days ago, but only in cli, not directly in hiveos


[10/15/2021 9:00 AM] geezar#8187
Good result either way


[10/15/2021 9:02 AM] apexpool#3878
yes. it was with 2800 for memory, not good long term, rejected shares (not many, but some)


[10/15/2021 9:40 AM] geezar#8187
Damn impressive - the FE Non LHR's will run 170-175 depending how hard you push them 115-125w range


[10/15/2021 9:41 AM] geezar#8187
So makes the 60ti Samsung's very desirable


[10/15/2021 9:44 AM] Fabio1402#4525
one of each to be fair! i am finding the overclocks are so sensitive...  move up 50mhz and it drops to half hash rate


[10/15/2021 9:46 AM] apexpool#3878
I also have both. 
my settings:

[10/15/2021 9:47 AM] Fabio1402#4525
il try these or move closer to them! but i just it so sensitive, what  miner you running there?

LHR set to 100 is that right?


[10/15/2021 9:51 AM] Fabio1402#4525
ive copied your gigabyte settings like for like... just seeing if it helps


[10/15/2021 9:53 AM] apexpool#3878
t-rex


[10/15/2021 9:53 AM] Fabio1402#4525
drops to 95MH ;/


[10/15/2021 9:53 AM] apexpool#3878
yes, LHR 100 for the Hynix card.


[10/15/2021 9:54 AM] apexpool#3878
what card do you have? power limit set, too? what is the current temperature of the card?


[10/15/2021 9:55 AM] Fabio1402#4525
Gigabyte 3060TI
ANd MSI 3060TI

Temps are at 45 right now, power limit copied yours for now - 110


[10/15/2021 9:55 AM] apexpool#3878
t-rex? it will not work with any other miner with the same settings


[10/15/2021 9:55 AM] Fabio1402#4525
il try trex now


[10/15/2021 9:55 AM] Fabio1402#4525
your LHR is set to 100 si that right


[10/15/2021 9:55 AM] apexpool#3878
100 for Hynix and 92 for Samsung now


[10/15/2021 9:56 AM] apexpool#3878
you need to test for your cards, but I guess they should be similar.


[10/15/2021 9:56 AM] Fabio1402#4525
oh can you set different LHR rates for dif cards?? (sorry bit new to this)


[10/15/2021 9:56 AM] apexpool#3878
yes, they are completely different because of the memory


[10/15/2021 9:58 AM] Fabio1402#4525
does the LHR autotune not exist on ERGO that already exists on ETH?

Usually LHR autotunes its self on eth

And sorry to ask so many qs, does it not show LHR locks on TREX for ERGO? do you just need to find the right figure that works?


[10/15/2021 9:59 AM] apexpool#3878
LHR autotune exists and it shows the values and locks in t-rex 0.24.2


[10/15/2021 9:59 AM] Fabio1402#4525
so u let it auto tune... then kind of hard code them figurres to save time


[10/15/2021 10:01 AM] apexpool#3878
yes, you can let it autotune. but once you know the values, it is quicked to specify them as parameters.


[10/15/2021 10:01 AM] Fabio1402#4525
trying trex now....


[10/15/2021 10:11 AM] Fabio1402#4525
could you share your miner config setup on hiveos for TRex, doesnt seem to work out the box for me


[10/15/2021 10:12 AM] Fabio1402#4525
oh discard! its running now


[10/15/2021 10:14 AM] Fabio1402#4525
do i need to set LHR-auto-tune on? or does it do it by default

it's on by default, you can disable it if you want


[10/15/2021 10:15 AM] Fabio1402#4525
just not seeing any mention of LHR anyway


[10/15/2021 10:15 AM] Fabio1402#4525

try to set it with "lhr-tune": "100,93" for example


[10/15/2021 10:16 AM] apexpool#3878
in extra config parameters


[10/15/2021 10:17 AM] Fabio1402#4525
on it now


[10/15/2021 10:17 AM] apexpool#3878
maybe it's not enabled by default... I thought it is.


[10/15/2021 10:17 AM] Fabio1402#4525
it is when i do eth


[10/15/2021 10:17 AM] Fabio1402#4525
for sure


[10/15/2021 10:17 AM] Fabio1402#4525
so wonder if i been hitting lhr locks all this time :/


[10/15/2021 10:17 AM] Fabio1402#4525
hence the 120 figure max


[10/15/2021 10:17 AM] Fabio1402#4525

you need that space after ":"


[10/15/2021 10:21 AM] Fabio1402#4525
Thank you..well spotted, trying that now


[10/15/2021 10:24 AM] apexpool#3878
any updates?


[10/15/2021 10:24 AM] Fabio1402#4525

i changed it to gloablf or al l cards 95 to see if it worked


[10/15/2021 10:31 AM] apexpool#3878
you are using the 0.24.0 version in this screenshot


[10/15/2021 10:31 AM] apexpool#3878
not the latest


[10/15/2021 10:31 AM] Fabio1402#4525
Yeah sorry i dropped a version and retried to see if it made any differnce, il go back to latest again


[10/15/2021 10:33 AM] Fabio1402#4525
oh i am seeing LHR now....

I see the new version was downloaded here


[10/15/2021 10:33 AM] apexpool#3878
give it a few minutes to see it work


[10/15/2021 10:34 AM] apexpool#3878
if it is not changing, start with higher values


[10/15/2021 10:34 AM] Fabio1402#4525
why higher? (out of interest)


[10/15/2021 10:34 AM] Fabio1402#4525
i thought ud want to bring lhr down?


[10/15/2021 10:34 AM] apexpool#3878
you want LHR tune value as high as possible


[10/15/2021 10:34 AM] Fabio1402#4525
arr higher as in...its not locking


[10/15/2021 10:34 AM] Fabio1402#4525
so move it up


[10/15/2021 10:34 AM] apexpool#3878
95 meams 95% of the capacity of the card used for mining


[10/15/2021 10:35 AM] apexpool#3878
moving automatically up is slow


[10/15/2021 10:35 AM] Fabio1402#4525
just these figures seem so poor


[10/15/2021 10:35 AM] Fabio1402#4525
your getting 160+ :/


[10/15/2021 10:35 AM] apexpool#3878
no, but close to 160.


[10/15/2021 10:36 AM] apexpool#3878
for Samsung


[10/15/2021 10:36 AM] apexpool#3878
and close to 140 for Hynix


[10/15/2021 10:37 AM] Fabio1402#4525
so LHR isnt my problem then üò¶ Thought it may of been that


[10/15/2021 10:39 AM] Fabio1402#4525
oh!


[10/15/2021 10:39 AM] Fabio1402#4525
im getting 128 now with some new OC figures


[10/15/2021 10:39 AM] Fabio1402#4525
this is good....


[10/15/2021 10:39 AM] Fabio1402#4525
looks like i can start to fine tune this! not seen anything over 120 for weeks of trying so this is a step in the right direction!


[10/15/2021 10:40 AM] Fabio1402#4525
Thank you so much @apexpool ! i can crack on with the usual OC routine now!


[10/15/2021 10:40 AM] apexpool#3878
you are welcome!


[10/15/2021 10:45 AM] Fabio1402#4525
if LHR is set to 95.... i assume it will auto tune down if it hits locks?


[10/15/2021 10:45 AM] apexpool#3878
yes.


[10/15/2021 10:46 AM] apexpool#3878
and up if it's running stable for a longer period


[10/15/2021 10:46 AM] apexpool#3878
but down is quicker than up.


[10/15/2021 10:46 AM] Fabio1402#4525
just waked it to 100 and i will see what it comes down to then set it

[10/15/2021 10:47 AM] Fabio1402#4525
may i ask about power... with ergo power seems to be a dit different...in that sometimes lower power can incrase HASHRATE, have i read this right?


[10/15/2021 10:49 AM] apexpool#3878
yes, very high power is not efficient. but lowering power will also lower the hashrate, starting from a certain point


[10/15/2021 10:49 AM] apexpool#3878
you have to find the best balance


[10/15/2021 10:49 AM] apexpool#3878
and high power triggers LHR


[10/15/2021 10:50 AM] apexpool#3878
I did some test yesterday with my Zotac 3060ti / Hynix card, and for certain settings, increasing the power did not modify the hashrate at all


[10/15/2021 10:51 AM] apexpool#3878
for example with 120w, 130w and 140w I was reaching the same hashrate.


[10/15/2021 10:51 AM] Fabio1402#4525
so you think higher power can trip the LHR's sometimes?


[10/15/2021 10:52 AM] Fabio1402#4525
so....100-130 is about the ball park playground with 3060TI's then?


[10/15/2021 10:52 AM] Fabio1402#4525
il have a play, but results are promising!


[10/15/2021 10:52 AM] apexpool#3878
yes, 100-130.


[10/15/2021 10:52 AM] apexpool#3878
if the miner does not have LHR tune, higher power will always trigger LHR


[10/15/2021 10:53 AM] Fabio1402#4525
130 now....getting there.....


[10/15/2021 10:53 AM] apexpool#3878
only newer miners, from the last weeks, can deal with higher powers and LHR, it seems.


[10/15/2021 10:53 AM] Fabio1402#4525
ohh this is such a relief, i have spent days on end stressing with this


[10/15/2021 10:53 AM] Gytis#3049
I havent confirmed it but some cards of mine had lower accepted shares rate compared to others (0 rejected). Increasing voltage/power limit fixed it. 
It may have only seemed that way, did not do any proper testing to validate this theory


[10/15/2021 11:02 AM] Fabio1402#4525
i see what you mean.... 5watt difference between LHR 90 & LHR 97


[10/15/2021 11:04 AM] Fabio1402#4525
dont have a 3080 do you @apexpool aswell? wanted to sneak your settings, i have ended up very close to your 3060Ti settings for best HRate


[10/15/2021 11:05 AM] apexpool#3878
no, I have 3070ti FE cards and Vega 56 cards


[10/15/2021 11:07 AM] Gytis#3049
just today i was looking at 3080 lhr for 1300eur, considering buying it


[10/15/2021 11:07 AM] Gytis#3049
not sure if its worth it


[10/15/2021 11:08 AM] Fabio1402#4525
i got mine for ¬£800 @Gytis


[10/15/2021 11:08 AM] Gytis#3049
also one for 1.2k, tho blower design


[10/15/2021 11:08 AM] Fabio1402#4525
just keep making silly offers on ebay!


[10/15/2021 11:08 AM] Gytis#3049
please elaborate?


[10/15/2021 11:08 AM] Fabio1402#4525
i have a 3080 waterboard version that i bought by accident


[10/15/2021 11:12 AM] Fabio1402#4525
i keep making stupid offers on ebay, eventually it pays off


[10/15/2021 11:13 AM] Gytis#3049
you just message seller?


[10/15/2021 11:13 AM] Gytis#3049
im not aware of different way


[10/15/2021 11:13 AM] Fabio1402#4525
sometimes it gives you option to make an offer


[10/15/2021 11:14 AM] Gytis#3049
:tuxThonk:


[10/15/2021 11:14 AM] Gytis#3049
ill keep it in mind


[10/15/2021 11:15 AM] Fabio1402#4525
if u see a card for ¬£1400, offer ¬£600

he might come back with a counter offer

best bet is try get cards as soon as they go up on ebay before everyone flocks them with offers


[10/15/2021 11:15 AM] Fabio1402#4525
i got my 3080 waterboard version for ¬£800 :/

Didnt realise it was bloody waterforce though, needs a pump


[10/15/2021 11:15 AM] Fabio1402#4525
and its NON LHR too to add insult to injury! lol


[10/15/2021 11:15 AM] Fabio1402#4525

would be happy to get it off you for that price :KBBQ_kek:


[10/15/2021 12:33 PM] Herk#6019
¬£800 is a steal for a 3080 non-lhr, but being a watercooled version you need to invest another ¬£400 on top to actually be able to use it


[10/15/2021 12:34 PM] Herk#6019
which is why those sold very very hard

since only a handful of people have custom watercooled pcs given the risks involved and cost


[10/15/2021 12:35 PM] Fabio1402#4525
just wish i could convert it back to fans!


[10/15/2021 12:35 PM] Herk#6019
it doesn't have any kind of fan header on it?


[10/15/2021 12:51 PM] Gytis#3049
i do have unused liquid cooling gear üëÄ probably should look into this kind of deals


[10/15/2021 12:52 PM] Herk#6019
well, if you have it, it was definitely worth it at some point... a decent pump can probably cool a lot of cards


[10/15/2021 12:52 PM] Herk#6019
I'd imagine 6+


[10/15/2021 2:17 PM] Gytis#3049
Oh yeah, i got a solid pump


[10/15/2021 2:17 PM] Gytis#3049
also i got 360 radiator and one thicc 280


[10/15/2021 2:17 PM] Gytis#3049
so basically im all set for something like this


[10/15/2021 5:26 PM] SnowPea#7485
Did you get any error? miners are usually very similar, the most basic settings are algorithm (-a) , pool address (-o)  and wallet (-u) , try to set these up and see if it runs

@geezar my 3060 has been super stable at 117mh at 90w for at least two weeks. A few days ago when i was messing with my 3060ti lhr, the 3060 started to giving me problems like random cuda illegal memory error that caused the miner to restart, and also started throwing invalid shares, do you have any thoughts what might have caused it?


[10/16/2021 12:24 AM] Paktra#9695

4gh*

check out the solo pools previous blocks, 2 miners is a good example - watch out for people adding rented hash to bump up their overall hash but some - are pretty impressive (lucky)


[10/16/2021 11:01 AM] CH#6305
Hey, I‚Äôve been mining with a server psu but thinking about switching to an atx to reduce noise. Just wondering what you guys would recommend for say a rig of 6 5700xts? I can‚Äôt find one high wat or two lower watt that would have enough pcie 6+2pins cables to power all risers + cards. Thanks all


[10/16/2021 11:36 AM] apexpool#3878
how much power are you using (real power)? or you don't have a wall meter?


[10/16/2021 11:37 AM] CH#6305
About 1100


[10/16/2021 11:37 AM] CH#6305
I could get 2 750 watts I‚Äôd guess? it‚Äôs the extra pcie cables and splitters I can‚Äôt find


[10/16/2021 11:39 AM] apexpool#3878
I have a Corsair RM100x and a Aresgame ASG850, and my rig is using 1250w.


[10/16/2021 11:39 AM] apexpool#3878
Corsair is much better, more PCIe cables


[10/16/2021 11:39 AM] apexpool#3878
but a bigger one is much more expensive from Corsair


[10/16/2021 11:39 AM] Dv#3650
How many ports does it have?


[10/16/2021 11:40 AM] apexpool#3878
6 PCIe ports, but one is used by CPU. You just gave me an idea, I can move the mainboard to the other PSU and free one PCIe


[10/16/2021 11:40 AM] apexpool#3878
(the Corsair)


[10/16/2021 11:41 AM] apexpool#3878
and it comes with 4 PCIe cables, but I bought another 2


[10/16/2021 11:41 AM] apexpool#3878
the other one is semi-modular, I should have bought a different one.


[10/16/2021 11:41 AM] apexpool#3878
but I bought it first for my PC, it was more than enough


[10/16/2021 11:42 AM] apexpool#3878
now the PC has its 500w PSU back.


[10/16/2021 11:42 AM] Dv#3650
I know that the EVGA 1600w psus have I believe 8 ports?


[10/16/2021 11:42 AM] apexpool#3878
that would be perfect for @CH I guess


[10/16/2021 11:44 AM] Dv#3650
Actually it's 9

[10/16/2021 11:48 AM] Dv#3650
True, but ideally you spend as little as possible within a certain regard while building rigs to lessen your roi


[10/16/2021 11:49 AM] apexpool#3878
of course, me too. I am using a usb stick for hiveos, I could buy a M.2 SSD, but it costs a few tens of Euro üòÇ


[10/16/2021 11:50 AM] apexpool#3878
and I think I will wait until black friday to spare a few


[10/16/2021 11:50 AM] apexpool#3878
but it's not required. PSU is important.

[10/16/2021 12:05 PM] Moog#9672
is it weird trying to mine with a AMD R9 290X? üôÉ


[10/16/2021 12:13 PM] Herk#6019
I usually do it by TDP, so you have 6 cards that have a TDP of 225W


[10/16/2021 12:13 PM] Herk#6019
that would put you literally at the 80% of a 850W psu


[10/16/2021 12:13 PM] Herk#6019
so instead of spending a lot of money on a 1600W (with which you'd be over the 80% if your cards would sit at 225W each)


[10/16/2021 12:13 PM] Herk#6019
you can get 2x 850


[10/16/2021 12:13 PM] Herk#6019
and put 3 cards on each


[10/16/2021 12:14 PM] Herk#6019
I don't have 5700XT but depending on how much power they actually draw (assuming it's a lot under that 225W) you might even be able to put 4 on one psu etc. or the system and 3 cards and so on


[10/16/2021 12:15 PM] Herk#6019
also, plenty of psus with 4 pcie ports so you would have no issues there (EVGA 850 GQ comes with 4x 2x8 cables as well which is very nice)


[10/16/2021 12:17 PM] Herk#6019
seasonic is another option since they sell the pcie cables for very cheap, at least in europe (I think it's about ‚Ç¨2-3 each and if you buy bulk that includes delivery)

[10/16/2021 1:26 PM] acadian.eth#2222
on one


[10/16/2021 1:29 PM] acadian.eth#2222
they only pull 900W while mining eth but cant add more, no more pcie lol


[10/16/2021 2:11 PM] Ananas#9063
if u guys have loud server PSUs you are using them wrong


[10/16/2021 2:12 PM] Ananas#9063
if noise is an issue, only draw ~950 watts from them max


[10/16/2021 2:12 PM] Ananas#9063
then they are no louder than a regular ATX PSU


[10/16/2021 2:49 PM] Pharotek#2932
could also do the HP server PSU awith a breakout board...... LOL whole package is like 130$. 1200w on a 220v line super easy to do with a double pull breaker

Brand new NVIDIA CMP 90HX Mining Card

Overclocked performance with optimized power settings (Based on our experience running these CMP 50HX)
98MH/s ETH
320W Power Consumption

Performance (Default Settings)
98MH/s +/- 5% ETH
1000 Sol/s +/- 5% ZEC
1250H/s +/- 5% XMR
320W Power Consumption +/- 10%‚Äã


[10/16/2021 7:20 PM] geezar#8187
So FE 70 on ETH pushing 62 MH/s for 115-120w x2 blows that 90HX out of the water, even 2 V1 3060's running the Dev driver... $1600 is nuts for that card


[10/16/2021 7:21 PM] geezar#8187
320w for a mining GPU is insane


[10/17/2021 4:07 PM] Fabio1402#4525
am i right in saying, you are better with 2 X 3060Tis, then you are a 3080


[10/17/2021 4:07 PM] Fabio1402#4525
3060TI = 150 ish
3080 = 210

3080 nearly double the cost

for most its probably whatever is cheap and have many pci-e slots


[10/19/2021 8:20 AM] Fabio1402#4525
ha, and thats the bit i struggle with, they only tend to have 6 slots!


[10/19/2021 8:20 AM] Fabio1402#4525
if that, then it jumps to 12+ slots


[10/19/2021 8:21 AM] andee#4722
some (most?) work with expanders, so you can get more slots on a 6 slot board


[10/19/2021 8:21 AM] Fabio1402#4525
PCI expanders?


[10/19/2021 8:21 AM] andee#4722
yep

you on about these?


[10/19/2021 8:22 AM] Fabio1402#4525
are these a standard/used thing by miners?


[10/19/2021 8:23 AM] andee#4722
impossible to tell if that is just a usb hub or an actual expander, many sell usb hubs marked at mining accessory

thats the actual link sorry


[10/19/2021 8:24 AM] andee#4722
they are not uncommon as an alternative when expanding


[10/19/2021 8:24 AM] andee#4722
but its not the norm


[10/19/2021 8:24 AM] andee#4722
that looks like a usb hub


[10/19/2021 8:25 AM] Fabio1402#4525
what you mean a usb hub sorry!

[10/19/2021 8:26 AM] andee#4722
I dont see chip name, so no way to check. but since risers are in the same ad they "should" be expanders


[10/19/2021 8:26 AM] Fabio1402#4525
i just want sure if these cause problems or they are quite reliable


[10/19/2021 8:26 AM] Fabio1402#4525
the method i mean, not this product


[10/19/2021 8:27 AM] andee#4722
from what I have seen if they work, they work. but might not be able to use all slots


[10/19/2021 8:28 AM] andee#4722
and +13 gpu's is not achievable unless there has been some changes the last few years


[10/19/2021 8:28 AM] andee#4722
on stock gaming cards at least


[10/19/2021 8:28 AM] Fabio1402#4525
so its ok for an extra 3-4 but nothing past that realy


[10/19/2021 8:29 AM] andee#4722
you might be able to use more of them, but I have also seen someone only getting 2 slots  on 1 expander working


[10/19/2021 8:30 AM] andee#4722
if all of these are costing $30 now I would put that money towards a MB


[10/19/2021 8:30 AM] andee#4722
they were $8-10 last time I checked them out


[10/19/2021 8:30 AM] Fabio1402#4525
more of a cpu/raw/ frame sort of presepctive!

These are $50 as they come with 4 risers to i beleive


[10/19/2021 8:33 AM] andee#4722
the one you linked is only an expander, no risers


[10/19/2021 8:33 AM] andee#4722
aah, 30 pounds.. even more expensive

what are the power connectors for they they have so much of?


[10/19/2021 8:38 AM] Fabio1402#4525
is that if your not using risers to deliver more power to the pci slot


[10/19/2021 8:41 AM] andee#4722
these boards are made for putting gpu straight to motherboard


[10/19/2021 8:42 AM] andee#4722
made for cases like this

[10/19/2021 8:44 AM] Fabio1402#4525
arr i really prefer the ones that break out


[10/19/2021 9:19 AM] Dv#3650
I think it depends on the chipset and how many pcie lanes it supports


[10/19/2021 9:21 AM] Dv#3650
I'm running 12 cards on asus prime z390-a boards, it only has 6 pcie slots, 3 16x and 3 1x, i have two 1 to 4 splitters and all the other slots are filled as well


[10/19/2021 9:22 AM] Fabio1402#4525
how do the pci lanes work

Is it one lane per gpu?


[10/19/2021 9:22 AM] Fabio1402#4525
what splitters do you use?


[10/19/2021 9:24 AM] Dv#3650

[10/19/2021 9:24 AM] Fabio1402#4525
oh is the pci lane thing a CPU thing then, not a mobo thing


[10/19/2021 9:24 AM] Dv#3650
I believe, but could be wrong, that when using risers the cards are only using 1 lane as they are being ran in 1x


[10/19/2021 9:25 AM] Fabio1402#4525
Pentium(R) Gold G6400 CPU  - so this is my cpu

it's both but yea

I think the board might need to support it as well from a bios level


[10/19/2021 9:26 AM] Fabio1402#4525
how do you read that?

as 16?


[10/19/2021 9:26 AM] andee#4722
there are still compatibility problems


[10/19/2021 9:26 AM] Dv#3650
yea probably with bios


[10/19/2021 9:27 AM] Dv#3650
think it means it can use a max of 16 at any given time


[10/19/2021 9:27 AM] Fabio1402#4525
i have a z490 which seems to support 16 lanes from a gogle


[10/19/2021 9:27 AM] Fabio1402#4525

there's also some bios settings you have to change as well


[10/19/2021 9:28 AM] Fabio1402#4525

In this video I show what BIOS settings I use on my Z390-P motherboard in order for my rig to support more than 4 GPUs, it took me a whole day to figure out these settings, and the motherboard is very picky, so you have to put them in exactly.

[10/19/2021 8:40 PM] Ananas#9063
The card was working completely fine, only thing I really did was repaste and disconnect-reconnect the 4pin blower fan


[10/19/2021 8:40 PM] Herk#6019
ouch


[10/19/2021 9:10 PM] andee#4722
did you fix the fan cable properly? fans should move on startup as one indicator that it has power


[10/19/2021 9:10 PM] andee#4722
my polaris cards spins the fans a little then they stop


[10/19/2021 9:48 PM] Swim#4211
Any of you guys find success using just 1 of the two 8 pins on a vega 56 ? or is that dangerous?


[10/19/2021 9:49 PM] Swim#4211
They sure use alot of pcie cables


[10/19/2021 9:49 PM] Swim#4211
but they wattage is dialled back alot


[10/20/2021 2:52 AM] Ananas#9063
Gonna test just the fan itself tomorrow. But pretty sure it's fine. It's an OEM Acer 1060 6gb blower card. But I think the fan not being connected shouldnt be an obstacle in recognizing the card either way, maybe im wrong

Hey whats the average price for a vega 56


[10/20/2021 4:51 PM] geezar#8187
varies - best bet is check the used 'sold' prices on eBay in your location 600-800 or even higher depending on the demand... with the market popping likely to go higher..

hey is mining pretty much 24/7 for months bad for my pc, i know there is a lot of variables about it but my pc temp is around 40


[10/21/2021 4:35 AM] apexpool#3878
it cannot be bad, the GPU temperatures are much lower than while playing games. there are are some coins like RVN which are causing higher temperatures, you have to be careful with that, but for ERG it should not be a problem.


[10/21/2021 4:54 AM] Bloody Mojo#4610
Sweet, so if i was to mine different coins what temp should i be worried about long term. soz for the rookie questions mining with my own pc and looking into mining rigs


[10/21/2021 4:54 AM] apexpool#3878
it depends on the card. read the specs.

[10/21/2021 5:10 AM] darwin#0019
mining instructions on ErgoPlatform Org website seem incomplete: how does the mining pool you choose get your wallet address after running the stratum then (AMD) miner?  It'd also be good if there were some examples of commands with real syntax, not just variables in '<>'.


[10/21/2021 7:51 AM] andee#4722
those instructions are for mining to the node wallet, so there is no need to set any address


[10/21/2021 7:52 AM] andee#4722
99% use the closed source miners which most pools have instructions for


[10/21/2021 7:52 AM] andee#4722
or the miner includes examples


[10/21/2021 7:52 AM] darwin#0019
well they didn't say you have to run a node on the mining computer

I'm low on pci-e rails..


[10/22/2021 11:12 AM] Swim#4211
Also, does the riser & GPU have to connect to the same PSU?


[10/22/2021 11:14 AM] apexpool#3878
it's not the best way, but it works. I am also doing this for the moment with a card for the same reason.


[10/22/2021 11:15 AM] apexpool#3878
yes, they should be connected to the same PSU, I would not risk otherwise.

Curiosity, if building your mining rig ontop of your existing gaming pc. So lets say u use mobo, cpu, ram from that pc into your rig and add a couple of gpus with risers, the typical. Would it be bad to use it to game on 1 card whilst the others are mining? Anyone experience eith this?

why wold it be bad?


[10/22/2021 12:06 PM] apexpool#3878
you can use it to mine with all GPUs while gaming, but the first one will have a low and variable hashrate


[10/22/2021 12:22 PM] Swim#4211
You can easily pause the mining on your primary card & game while the other mine then unpause later

I have a "Tester" that shorts the pins for me, it came with the PSU


[10/22/2021 1:50 PM] apexpool#3878
so when the power stitch on the PSU is On, the PSU is On.


[10/22/2021 1:50 PM] apexpool#3878
and you have to start the second PSU before the one with the mainboard, otherwise the cards powered by it will not be recognized.

Mostly because games do often ask more of the card, especially the power it pulls. Ive heard of a friend who's msi afterburner settings auto reset when playing games causing the other cards to also lose their oc/uv... That was mostly my main concern

I never tried with msi afterburner settings, when I tried I was only using command-line OC settings.

On the sapphire's pc, a non mining card is in the primary slot & ive ignored the 2nd pcie full 16x slot (wont fit cards) and used a 009s riser instead, is this why is it hashing poorly?

are there any dedicated mining machines that i can use for Ergo ?


[10/25/2021 3:52 PM] miner29#2975
GPUs are what mine Ergo.  need to build or buy a rig.  Good luck.


[10/25/2021 3:54 PM] Canberry#7404
we out here CPU mining ergo


[10/25/2021 4:09 PM] miner29#2975
You can do lots of things....doesnt mean you should.  So how many Mhs are you managing on your cpu?


[10/25/2021 4:10 PM] miner29#2975
I see 10700K gets around 8Mhs or about 0.5 Ergo per month....


[10/25/2021 4:11 PM] miner29#2975
A single 1050ti gpu does 3x that.....

Hello. Long time lurker...first time poster. Can someone break down pros/cons of mining Ergo for someone like me who has zero experience/expertise? I read things that make it sound easy but get lost when reading about technical specs. Looking for advice. Im willing to invest around $5000US for a dedicated mining rig if I think it's something i could handle.


[10/25/2021 6:47 PM] SJW22#1017
Or perhaps there are some sources for novices someone could direct me to? Thanks


[10/25/2021 7:27 PM] Canberry#7404

quick question


[10/27/2021 2:32 PM] skoenman#9556
what would happen if you mine and try and use the gpu for something else???


[10/27/2021 2:33 PM] skoenman#9556
like game and mine??? hashrate will drop but will it auto adjust the memory used??


[10/27/2021 2:33 PM] apexpool#3878
hashrate will drop and fluctuate.


[10/27/2021 2:34 PM] skoenman#9556
but it should be ok ??


[10/27/2021 2:35 PM] apexpool#3878
I guess it depends on your OC settings, the game might change them. you should watch the temperatures to be sure it is safe.


[10/27/2021 2:36 PM] skoenman#9556
ok cool just wanna test and see what it does...

Hey guys I got an extra sapphire vega 56 but it only pulls 170 even with timing edit & OC, What gives? 
Put it in my housemate's pc (ASUS m5a97 could not find any mining settings in bios) It's connected by a riser with an older card is in primary slot to run the system & an empty 2nd slot (extender cable too short) The Vega is on a 009s riser connected to a 1x slot. Is this what's causing the problem or did I miss something?


[10/28/2021 12:28 PM] Swim#4211
It's on win10 with the virtual memory up


[10/28/2021 12:28 PM] Fabio1402#4525
isnt 170 good??


[10/28/2021 12:28 PM] Fabio1402#4525
what to mine says it would pull 155


[10/28/2021 12:28 PM] Swim#4211
My 2x red dragons pull just under 200. It's good if your watching your wattage yes


[10/28/2021 12:28 PM] Swim#4211
I like to give mine 180 ish Watts


[10/28/2021 12:29 PM] Swim#4211
or just a touch more


[10/28/2021 12:29 PM] Swim#4211
On my other vega's there is a blockage at 175-177 that you need just the right setup & oc to break


[10/28/2021 12:30 PM] Swim#4211
perhaps It's the AMD tweak timings that are different from the red dragon one I'm using?


[10/28/2021 12:34 PM] apexpool#3878
I was able to go over 200 MH/s with my Sapphire Pulse Vega56. The key is increasing voltage and core clock, and of course the amdmemtweak parameters. I did not save the OC settings, I was just doing a test, I am currently using some settings for low power usage, for about 160 MH/s.


[10/28/2021 12:51 PM] Swim#4211
Thank you Sir. 
Are there are any bios settings that would elude a newcomer & help with rates on an old m5a97? I didn't really see anything to do with 4g or mining. The pci settings may have gone over my head but there were few & not like my new pc


[10/28/2021 12:51 PM] Swim#4211
Also, how much voltage is safe to add to the core and memory voltage?


[10/28/2021 12:51 PM] apexpool#3878
what settings are you using now?


[10/28/2021 12:52 PM] Swim#4211
I was trying to just increase the power but no dice


[10/28/2021 12:52 PM] apexpool#3878
you should increase the core clock.
the idea is to have the lowest voltage possible for a core clock that will not crash the mining rig.


[10/28/2021 12:53 PM] apexpool#3878
I only did changes in Bios to be able to use more than 5 cards on the mainboard. they did not help me increase the hashrate.

[10/28/2021 12:55 PM] Swim#4211
Thanks for all this


[10/28/2021 12:56 PM] Swim#4211
If its core clock needed is just sub 1600mhz ok?


[10/28/2021 12:56 PM] apexpool#3878
I don't think I increased core clock that much


[10/28/2021 12:57 PM] apexpool#3878
the settings look ok


[10/28/2021 12:57 PM] apexpool#3878
how much are you getting?


[10/28/2021 12:57 PM] Swim#4211
The settings are really funny. One day I was playing with slot 2 settings for a long long time. I decreased and increased then it wierdly allowed me to hash 205/6 but after a needed reset it would never let me there again> idk what I did to trick it lol. This was on the red dragon


[10/28/2021 12:58 PM] Swim#4211
On the sapphire about 168 after fee


[10/28/2021 12:58 PM] Swim#4211

[10/28/2021 12:59 PM] Swim#4211
again, empty slot 2 16x and using sapphire a 009s riser


[10/28/2021 12:59 PM] Swim#4211
Does using a molex instead of another pcie cause hashrate drop?


[10/28/2021 12:59 PM] Swim#4211
I didnt have extra slots on my psu


[10/28/2021 1:01 PM] apexpool#3878
I am getting 175 MH/s with: core clock 1261   /  mem clock 847  /  core voltage 793 (on hiveos)
```amdmemtweak --CL 20 --RC 36 --RP 14 --WR 14 --CWL 8 --FAW 12 --RAS 22 --REF 65000 --RFC 249 --RTP 5 --RRDL 6 --RRDS 3 --WTRL 9 --WTRS 4 --RCDRD 14 --RCDWR 12```


[10/28/2021 1:02 PM] Swim#4211
nice slim build


[10/28/2021 1:02 PM] apexpool#3878
that's the highest hashrate I saved. But I was able to go over 200 MH/s with 960 memory clock, same amdmemtweak settings, and higher core clock and core voltage - but I did not save the settings.


[10/28/2021 1:03 PM] Swim#4211

OverVolting spooked me a little too much to try


[10/28/2021 1:04 PM] apexpool#3878
I don't know, but increasing core voltage will not help you


[10/28/2021 1:04 PM] Swim#4211
ok good


[10/28/2021 1:04 PM] apexpool#3878
you increase it only if it crashes because it is too low.


[10/28/2021 1:04 PM] Swim#4211
ive noticed dropping it is good. one of my red dragon hashes great at 950mV


[10/28/2021 1:05 PM] apexpool#3878
I don't think I ever increased it over 850 mV


[10/28/2021 1:05 PM] apexpool#3878
but I don't remember exactly for the test over 200 MH/s.


[10/28/2021 1:05 PM] apexpool#3878
I am now at 756 mV.


[10/28/2021 1:05 PM] apexpool#3878
the lowest I could set without crashing the rig.


[10/28/2021 1:07 PM] apexpool#3878
this is what I am using now. the last card is the Sapphire Pulse. The first 2 are Asus Rog Strix Vega56, identical, but very different at mining.

[10/29/2021 5:52 PM] SnowPea#7485
The wire is inside the wall....


[10/29/2021 5:52 PM] geezar#8187
what model is your PSU snow?


[10/29/2021 5:52 PM] ercovero#0957
There you can see it too


[10/29/2021 5:52 PM] geezar#8187
check the ratings/stats and work out your full load + some headroom (ideally 10-20%)


[10/29/2021 5:52 PM] ercovero#0957
Pull some inches and you can check the kind of wire do you use and whats the rate on it


[10/29/2021 5:52 PM] SnowPea#7485
I have a evga 650w G5 and a very old OCZ 700w psu


[10/29/2021 5:53 PM] geezar#8187
wall meter to check the actual pull too


[10/29/2021 5:53 PM] ercovero#0957
Thats key‚òùÔ∏è


[10/29/2021 5:53 PM] SnowPea#7485
I dont have a wall meter, maybe its time to get one


[10/29/2021 5:54 PM] ercovero#0957
Also you can get a ampe meter clamp and check the power draw direct from the wire


[10/29/2021 5:54 PM] geezar#8187
100% - example being AMD - very different at the wall - best to be safe and PSU's are not $$$... could be time to consider a server PSU or good quality branded one Snow


[10/29/2021 5:54 PM] ercovero#0957
This can work out too


[10/29/2021 5:54 PM] ercovero#0957
Yeah, never trust power draw calculated by software

these are dirt cheap and available globally - good investment (better ones out there but this is the minimum for knowing the actual pull Snow)

Best tool to check everything


[10/29/2021 5:56 PM] SnowPea#7485
Ok, i was looking at this one too


[10/29/2021 5:57 PM] geezar#8187
Thats nice @ercovero - 100% safety is key - as is making sure... you put a safe PL on the GPU's - running them all without a PL would be well over your current max so always be careful especially when adding a new GPU if your already close to your max


[10/29/2021 5:57 PM] SnowPea#7485
Is it safe to leave this one plugged in all the time and then plug my power strip tower on it?


[10/29/2021 5:57 PM] ercovero#0957
Not where i live


[10/29/2021 5:57 PM] ercovero#0957
Got it too


[10/29/2021 5:57 PM] geezar#8187
I tend not to leave them 24/7 - seen too many melted examples... more resilient versions available


[10/29/2021 5:58 PM] SnowPea#7485
Ok, got it


[10/29/2021 5:58 PM] ercovero#0957
Also whatch dog seeking for power limit on the rig


[10/29/2021 5:58 PM] geezar#8187
But for the price - Amazon click away

On hive os you can schedule power cycles

bitten me before - adding a GPU with stock settings without realising.... make sure the miner is not auto starting and get that sucker dialled in


[10/29/2021 5:59 PM] geezar#8187
key is.... is it Samsung or Hynix @SnowPea ... üôè

[10/29/2021 6:00 PM] ercovero#0957
Btw with this


[10/29/2021 6:00 PM] ercovero#0957
I use some and they are rated to hold 15 amp and they dont


[10/29/2021 6:00 PM] ercovero#0957
Dont even 13 amps 24/7


[10/29/2021 6:00 PM] ercovero#0957
I make my own cord


[10/29/2021 6:00 PM] SnowPea#7485
Should be samsung, i got the same evga 3060 last month and its samsung


[10/29/2021 6:01 PM] geezar#8187
going now but SNow - as Ercovero suggests check the ratings/quality of the cables.. mixing random PSU's and pushing them hard... good luck bro


[10/29/2021 6:01 PM] SnowPea#7485
Ok, is it better to have two same brand psus?


[10/29/2021 6:02 PM] ercovero#0957
I bought 750w x2 hp server psu and use for 4-5 amps i dont wanna maxe out of those, they. Start to get loud when get hot


[10/29/2021 6:02 PM] SnowPea#7485
Ok, i'll keep an eye on that, thanks!


[10/29/2021 6:03 PM] SnowPea#7485
So i have a 700w and a 650w but if im only using ~500w total, is that about 4.2amp?


[10/29/2021 6:04 PM] ercovero#0957
No


[10/29/2021 6:04 PM] ercovero#0957
The outlet power draw is rsted by the efficiency of the psu


[10/29/2021 6:05 PM] SnowPea#7485
Ok, so i just need the wall meter to measure whats the actual power draw, then convert it to amp


[10/29/2021 6:05 PM] ercovero#0957
If you use bronce they are rated to 80% so, if you get 1000w power draw from psu the outlet power draw will be 1250
As it 1000/0.8


[10/29/2021 6:05 PM] ercovero#0957
Thats the reason you should get a wlal meter o


[10/29/2021 6:05 PM] SnowPea#7485
One is bronze and one is gold


[10/29/2021 6:05 PM] ercovero#0957
And the server psu are rated platinium, 94% efficiency


[10/29/2021 6:05 PM] SnowPea#7485
Got it


[10/29/2021 6:05 PM] SnowPea#7485
I'll get another gold psu soon


[10/29/2021 6:07 PM] ercovero#0957
So if you have platinium them it will be 1000/0.94 thats 1063 watts to the wall


[10/29/2021 6:07 PM] ercovero#0957
But it may vary, so do your math and double check it with the wall amp meter


[10/29/2021 6:07 PM] SnowPea#7485
Does it draw 1063 even if you are only using...say 700w?


[10/29/2021 6:08 PM] ercovero#0957
Is an example for 1000watts power draw usage


[10/29/2021 6:09 PM] ercovero#0957
So no, use 700/0.8 and 700/.94 for your case


[10/29/2021 6:09 PM] ercovero#0957
For the example


[10/29/2021 6:10 PM] SnowPea#7485
I understand, but if you have a 1000w psu, does it always draw the max power from the wall or does it only draw the power you use?


[10/29/2021 6:10 PM] ercovero#0957
Nope


[10/29/2021 6:12 PM] SnowPea#7485
Sorry, i really have no idea about these things


[10/29/2021 6:12 PM] ercovero#0957
Is about efficiency if you use 500w on 850 watts psu is ok, but if is rated bronce you should do the math
500w/0.8 (because is rated for 80% efficiency) thats 625w on the outlet then 625watts /120 volt thats  5.2 amp


[10/29/2021 6:13 PM] SnowPea#7485
Got it


[10/29/2021 6:13 PM] SnowPea#7485
Then is it better to use one psu, like one 1000w for 4 gpus (500w), or is it better to split them into two psus?


[10/29/2021 6:14 PM] SnowPea#7485
If split is better, then is it better to use two exact same psu or same brand but different model or it doesnt matter if the two psus are different brands?


[10/29/2021 6:15 PM] ercovero#0957
It doesnt matter check the 8pin outout on the psu and how many of them you need


[10/29/2021 6:15 PM] SnowPea#7485
Got it


[10/29/2021 6:16 PM] SnowPea#7485
I was planning to get a 1000w psu to replace both of my psu


[10/29/2021 6:16 PM] apexpool#3878
I have 2 PSUs, 1 x 1000w and 1x850w, different brands. I would prefer a bigger PSU (more power) and more 8 pin connectors


[10/29/2021 6:16 PM] ercovero#0957
The only thing it matters is the same psu should power the same mobo/cpu/sata/molex conectors and pcie slots


[10/29/2021 6:16 PM] SnowPea#7485
The 1000w has 6vga slots, more than enough for 4 cards


[10/29/2021 6:16 PM] ercovero#0957
I rather server psu with atx board, you can plug as many 6pin to 8pin as you need


[10/29/2021 6:17 PM] ercovero#0957
And cheaper way cheaper


[10/29/2021 6:17 PM] SnowPea#7485
Yes, i understand this part


[10/29/2021 6:17 PM] ercovero#0957
2x150w with 16 wires is on 150$ but not good for mobo. Only for gpu and raisers


[10/29/2021 6:18 PM] ercovero#0957
Gtg rn anything just dm good luck be safe

[10/30/2021 6:34 AM] Swim#4211
Perhaps this includes your rate resets when the miner find a new hashing job


[10/30/2021 6:34 AM] CarterCat04#4253
That could make a lot of sense, anyone else use 2miners?


[10/30/2021 6:35 AM] Swim#4211
See if you can view it on a longer timeframe chart


[10/30/2021 6:36 AM] Swim#4211
I'm trying to figure out if my stock USB cable that came with a 009S riser is causing me hash loss.
Is "20276" type bad?


[10/30/2021 6:56 AM] Attila#3944
In #‚õè‚îÇmining there is an excel in the pinned files where there are a ton of oc settings. Even with a Hynix card you‚Äôre supposed to be above 130. Can‚Äôt you run HiveOS on your rig?

the 3060ti, but it's not the best choice. a Gigabyte 3060ti Eagle OC would be better

[10/30/2021 10:56 AM] apexpool#3878
the spreadsheet is very good, but it does not have values for the latest miner version, I think.

Hi guys, i am trying to change my payout level at https://ergo.herominers.com/#settings, but the site does not accept the IP: "Error: We haven't seen that IP for your address." It definitely is the IPv4 Address of the Machine the Miner runs at.

What can i do?

I needed tor restart my miner. Now it works!

Send help


[10/30/2021 6:47 PM] Terremot#4855
@DenAce Don't know what happened, can you help? I got locked out of quite a few channels for reasons I don't understand


[10/30/2021 6:48 PM] Anjaneyyyy#2882
Same here


[10/30/2021 6:49 PM] Terremot#4855
all I can do is wait and find out


[10/30/2021 6:50 PM] Terremot#4855
@apexpool Thanks for your help with the tuning.  Can't get back into the overclocking channel to thank you

seems quite decent to me


[10/30/2021 6:53 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
Alrighty


[10/30/2021 6:53 PM] Terremot#4855
RX470 is usually around 63mhs


[10/30/2021 6:54 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
Hope ERG will have a mobile wallet for iOS soon.. i dont like that yoroi chrome wallet


[10/30/2021 6:54 PM] Terremot#4855
could always make a desktop node


[10/30/2021 6:54 PM] Anjaneyyyy#2882
It's ight


[10/30/2021 6:54 PM] Anjaneyyyy#2882
My 570 gives around 65-70 too


[10/30/2021 6:54 PM] Anjaneyyyy#2882
Try increasing core clocks on the 570 it helps aswell


[10/30/2021 6:54 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
Alright good to hearüëåüèº


[10/30/2021 6:55 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
Ya but also want not much energy consumption, and if I go higher in core clock, they probably crash


[10/30/2021 6:56 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
But can try to up a bit ofc untill its stable, but since I started like 2 hours ago, ill check first if this keeps it up and running


[10/30/2021 6:56 PM] Terremot#4855
good plan


[10/30/2021 6:56 PM] Terremot#4855
and keep a note of the settings


[10/30/2021 6:56 PM] Terremot#4855
so easy to think "I can tweak that and remember"


[10/30/2021 6:57 PM] Terremot#4855
and 5 minutes later "what the hell did I change?"


[10/30/2021 6:58 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
I know, had that alot of times when tweaking rvn üòÇ


[10/30/2021 6:58 PM] apexpool#3878
indeed. I was writing them on paper, now I am using google spreadsheets


[10/30/2021 6:59 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
I always ss it and then next up the cores and stuff so it dont have to crash for same mistake again and so on


[10/30/2021 6:59 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
Ive looked at that, but that was a shitload of text haha and I just prefer a wallet i can access and check whenever I want


[10/30/2021 7:00 PM] Terremot#4855
once you've made one it's not that hard to do


[10/30/2021 7:00 PM] Terremot#4855
i keep the passwords and activation info on an external source


[10/30/2021 7:00 PM] Terremot#4855
so the node isn't running all the time


[10/30/2021 7:01 PM] Terremot#4855
Got a nice 183mhs on a vega 64 rn


[10/30/2021 7:01 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
The reason I never mined ERG before was the wallet what i didnt like but ive read that the ios wallet should be here soon


[10/30/2021 7:02 PM] apexpool#3878
I did over 200 MH/s with the Sapphive Pulse card when testing OC settings


[10/30/2021 7:02 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
But whats the reason theres such low wallet available, is it that hard for the ERGO team to accomplish it?


[10/30/2021 7:02 PM] apexpool#3878
Vega 56 with Samsung memory


[10/30/2021 7:02 PM] apexpool#3878
but high power usage, I don't remember exactly how much


[10/30/2021 7:04 PM] Terremot#4855
154W


[10/30/2021 7:04 PM] Terremot#4855
so not that bad


[10/30/2021 7:04 PM] Terremot#4855
I don't pay power, just pay for the location where I have my rig


[10/30/2021 7:05 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
Wish i had somethinng like that


[10/30/2021 7:06 PM] Terremot#4855
have to make sure that my power cost isn't more than the cost of renting the place


[10/30/2021 7:06 PM] Terremot#4855
and with 1.3Ghs on ergo now, I'm earning enough to pay the rent


[10/30/2021 7:06 PM] Terremot#4855
and more


[10/30/2021 7:08 PM] Terremot#4855
I only went onto a discord to get a new graphics card, and ended up a miner lol


[10/30/2021 7:08 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
Haha


[10/30/2021 7:09 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
I pay now ‚Ç¨0,25 energycosts per kw, and in january it goed up to ‚Ç¨0,47, so I can shutdown my rig for atleast half a year


[10/30/2021 7:09 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
And then hope, that the next half year the energy prices are lower again.. but pff so fked up these prices


[10/30/2021 7:10 PM] Terremot#4855
I got my unit just before the electricity prices went up


[10/30/2021 7:10 PM] apexpool#3878

problem is that they closed all the power stations without a plan of what to replace them with


[10/30/2021 7:16 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
So you pay right now, ‚Ç¨0,3190 for 1 kwh, and in december ‚Ç¨0,4708 per kw?


[10/30/2021 7:17 PM] apexpool#3878
yes.


[10/30/2021 7:17 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
Damn and you mine now?


[10/30/2021 7:17 PM] apexpool#3878
yes. and in December, too.


[10/30/2021 7:17 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
Or do you have solar ?


[10/30/2021 7:17 PM] apexpool#3878
when i was not mining, it was 24 cents.


[10/30/2021 7:17 PM] apexpool#3878
no, I am not, unfortunately.


[10/30/2021 7:18 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
Then you wont make profit at all right


[10/30/2021 7:18 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
You pay more energy then what you get in crypto?


[10/30/2021 7:18 PM] apexpool#3878
I am not selling.


[10/30/2021 7:18 PM] apexpool#3878
no, I do not pay more on energy.


[10/30/2021 7:19 PM] apexpool#3878

[10/30/2021 7:19 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745

[10/30/2021 7:21 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
Well i had this for example: I mine RVN, i make (energy costs) $122 per month. Then I (earn) $84 in RVN per month.


[10/30/2021 7:21 PM] Herk#6019
I don't think there's a place in the world right now where electricity would mean you're not profitable


[10/30/2021 7:21 PM] Herk#6019
at least if you've got a decent card


[10/30/2021 7:22 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
This, makes no profit it only costs more, for examole the energy price costs me more then what I earn


[10/30/2021 7:22 PM] apexpool#3878
then don't mine RVN, except if you want to keep it for a long time.


[10/30/2021 7:22 PM] apexpool#3878
I am mining on low power settings


[10/30/2021 7:22 PM] Herk#6019
well... if you mine rvn maybe, my bad

{Reactions}
ü§£ 

[10/30/2021 7:22 PM] Herk#6019
I don't understand why anyone would, you could just buy it if you believe in the project and mine the most profitable with your card


[10/30/2021 7:23 PM] Terremot#4855
ergo is the most profitable for me apart from eth


[10/30/2021 7:23 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
I do want to keep it, I keep all. But when you look at that example, and instead buy the crypto and not mine, its better


[10/30/2021 7:23 PM] Herk#6019
yes, it's the example that's the problem though


[10/30/2021 7:23 PM] Herk#6019
until kwh hits like $1.5 mining will still be profitable


[10/30/2021 7:24 PM] Herk#6019
or more even


[10/30/2021 7:24 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
Yeah and when I started mining, i made profit with raven, but then difficulty went up and got less RVN each day haha


[10/30/2021 7:24 PM] Herk#6019
:PES_JesusChristAlt:


[10/30/2021 7:24 PM] Terremot#4855
As long as my unit doesn't charge me for power, I'm making a profit


[10/30/2021 7:24 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
Weird, not for me with my 2x RX 470 and 3x RX 570


[10/30/2021 7:25 PM] Terremot#4855
RVN won't be profitable when it halves


[10/30/2021 7:25 PM] Terremot#4855
unless the price goes up


[10/30/2021 7:26 PM] Herk#6019
that should tell you something


[10/30/2021 7:26 PM] Herk#6019
you're either a) mining the wrong coin or b) should sell the cards


[10/30/2021 7:26 PM] Herk#6019
it's pretty simple


[10/30/2021 7:27 PM] Herk#6019
it doesn't make sense to mine at a loss in this market


[10/30/2021 7:27 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
Yes but ERG neither, if I look for ERG, and put in ‚Ç¨0,47 per kw, i pay $216 in energy and make $31 lol, thats like nothing


[10/30/2021 7:27 PM] Terremot#4855
mining at a loss should happen during a crypto winter


[10/30/2021 7:27 PM] Herk#6019
yes.. and we're nowhere near that


[10/30/2021 7:28 PM] Herk#6019
then sell the cards and just buy crypto with your electric bill $ instead


[10/30/2021 7:29 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
Yeah i will do that when I shutdown my rig for a half year


[10/30/2021 7:29 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
‚Ç¨0,47 my ass, never make profit on that high energy price


[10/30/2021 7:30 PM] Herk#6019
there's people paying more than that


[10/30/2021 7:33 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
I mean i do make profit with that energy price on ERG when i check whattomine, but yeah, only $30 so can better shutdown rig in that time and spin it up again when energy is lower, and then in the meanwhile just buy crypto what I normal would spend ‚Äúextra‚Äù in energy for my rig haha


[10/30/2021 7:41 PM] Kylobayd | JUNGLE#2745
Which mining pool do you guys use?


[10/30/2021 7:46 PM] andee#4722
making $31 with $216 is over 14% return


[10/30/2021 7:48 PM] andee#4722
my old polaris rig goes to 0 profit at $0.9, if I take the heat into the calculation the electricity could cost even more before its real 0 profit


[10/30/2021 7:51 PM] Attila#3944

Moved my rig to trex latest from 0.24.2 - my hashrate dropped on both rigs to 50%. Reverted of course, but alarming. Who‚Äôs the trex rep here?


[10/30/2021 8:30 PM] Attila#3944
Looks like a hiveos thing - when setting up the flight sheet choosing ‚Äúthe latest‚Äù produced poor hashrate results, manually picking 0.25.5 gives good hashrates

Is there a way to view my ERGO wallet (Yoroi in Chrome) on my iPhone?


[10/31/2021 1:36 AM] johnlop8#9735
Hi! I initialize a ergo Node Wallet with Re-store wallet option with the 4.0.15 update. I'm using that address to receive $erg from mining. I received 1 $erg today from mining but it doesn't update my balance in the Node Wallet. When I look the address in the explorer I did see the 1 $erg updated balance. There's anything wrong with the sync of my Node Wallet?

current hash rate looks like just 2 cards on 1 of my machine even tho im running a 3rd on another pc but the averages all have  a higher value like 3 cards


[10/31/2021 5:50 PM] hellyea#2223
It looks like the gpu‚Äôs i m getting is new + expensive + lhr.


[10/31/2021 5:50 PM] hellyea#2223
How come people mine now?


[10/31/2021 5:57 PM] Swim#4211
Some people have found ways to get around the LHR limiter. Others just buy AMD


[10/31/2021 5:58 PM] Swim#4211
I dread when eth2 gets complete & Eth miners come here to dilute the rewards


[10/31/2021 6:04 PM] hellyea#2223
So it‚Äôs best idea to buy cheaper version of gpu now?


[10/31/2021 6:05 PM] hellyea#2223
Since mh will cap at 30-40 anyways?


[10/31/2021 9:35 PM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
You need different workers.


[10/31/2021 11:09 PM] Swim#4211
How do I do this & am I losing hashrate by using the same pool & deposit address on 2 pc's?


[11/01/2021 12:02 AM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
Look at your miner command line format.  It should be <wallet address>.worker


[11/01/2021 12:03 AM] robotü§ñarmpitsüí™#2919
How else big farms farmed to the same address?


[11/01/2021 12:05 AM] Swim#4211
Thanks, I'll rename them in the morning. Pool stats seem ok tho. Always 500-600


[11/01/2021 7:07 AM] Raul Banea#6094
How can you find out your ip in hiveos ?


[11/01/2021 7:12 AM] apexpool#3878
it is on the first page below, but it's your private IP. It is for ssh to the machine.


[11/01/2021 7:40 AM] Salu#0001
Hey guys I got a safety Question, can I power a 2070 super on a single cable? So y cable one end split into gpu and the other to the riser (3 connections on one gpu), my 2070 super pulls 90 Watts and I'm assuming the riser will pull another 75 Watts at max, I plan to do the same on my rx570 4gb  I have a evga 1000w and plan to use 4 of the total 6 of the vga power slots my two vega 64s on the mobo directly so they don't need risers, any help appreciated


[11/01/2021 7:42 AM] Salu#0001
I'm using hiveos and I have safety measures in place for max power draw, should I be concerned of max tdp since theres hiveos watch dog that will limit power well below if by some chance my OCs fail?


[11/01/2021 7:47 AM] DenAce#1197
What kind of channels?


[11/01/2021 7:56 AM] Terremot#4855
It's sorted now thanks.  There was some kind of issue with the captcha bot

dont play with power and get the full conections


[11/01/2021 10:44 PM] ercovero#0957
also dont know how the power is distributed along the gpu, it should draw equaly


[11/01/2021 11:06 PM] Wii#9265
It will draw max 215 W (I checked). You have power limits and stuff but if they aren‚Äôt enabled (e.g. they crash) the GPU may draw more than 95 W. Assuming it hits 215 W, it will pull 75 W from riser, and 75 W from the 6-pin. That‚Äôs 150 W which fits in a single cable. For the rest, use a single 8 pin connector


[11/02/2021 1:00 AM] Salu#0001
thanks but my psu only has 6 vga ports


[11/02/2021 1:00 AM] Salu#0001
and 4 are taken by my two vegas


[11/02/2021 1:01 AM] Salu#0001
so either i retire my rx 570 or my 2070super


[11/02/2021 2:34 AM] Salu#0001
on second thought the best thing i can do is just upgrade my psu right? that way i wont have to split anything correct?


[11/02/2021 2:34 AM] Salu#0001
guess ill just save my 1000w psu, and get a 1200 watt,


[11/02/2021 2:35 AM] ercovero#0957
server psu are grreat


[11/02/2021 2:35 AM] Salu#0001
arent they loud as all hell


[11/02/2021 2:35 AM] Salu#0001
id rather get one that fits in my case


[11/02/2021 2:35 AM] Salu#0001

[11/02/2021 2:36 AM] ercovero#0957
lol


[11/02/2021 2:36 AM] ercovero#0957
b5 evga 850watts is enought for 2 cards and 2 raisers


[11/02/2021 2:36 AM] ercovero#0957
each port can be splitted


[11/02/2021 2:36 AM] ercovero#0957
i run those on my mining rig as well 2 3080ti and 2 raisers for each


[11/02/2021 2:37 AM] Salu#0001
how many vga ports does that one have?


[11/02/2021 2:37 AM] ercovero#0957
3


[11/02/2021 2:38 AM] Salu#0001
interesting


[11/02/2021 2:38 AM] Salu#0001
i could just sell my rx 570


[11/02/2021 2:38 AM] Salu#0001
and recover some of the cost of the new vega i just got


[11/02/2021 2:40 AM] Salu#0001
man i wish there was a way to power vga with another port from my psu


[11/02/2021 2:40 AM] Salu#0001
i just need one more vga port damn it


[11/02/2021 2:45 AM] ercovero#0957
you have only 1 port?


[11/02/2021 2:45 AM] ercovero#0957
why do you need a raiser?


[11/02/2021 2:45 AM] Salu#0001
no i need one more


[11/02/2021 2:46 AM] ercovero#0957
you running 2 gpu?


[11/02/2021 2:46 AM] Salu#0001
4x vgas for 2 vega 64s


[11/02/2021 2:46 AM] ercovero#0957
oh okok


[11/02/2021 2:46 AM] Salu#0001
the 2070 requires 2 vga ports


[11/02/2021 2:46 AM] Salu#0001
and the rx 570 i dont mind splitting into one vga port


[11/02/2021 2:47 AM] Salu#0001
but i could just burn the bank and get that 1600 watt psu...


[11/02/2021 2:47 AM] Salu#0001
that has 8 vga ports...


[11/02/2021 2:49 AM] Salu#0001
fuck it im not tempting fate


[11/02/2021 2:49 AM] Salu#0001
thanks for being the voice of reason


[11/02/2021 9:56 AM] Wii#9265
@Salu you can combine 2 psus


[11/02/2021 9:56 AM] Wii#9265
with an add2psu that costs like 10 bucks


[11/02/2021 9:56 AM] Wii#9265
then get some cheap corsair 550 W for the card


[11/02/2021 9:59 AM] Herk#6019
actually, I would avoid things like that, just use a psu jump starter, that's what I do


[11/02/2021 10:00 AM] Herk#6019
super cheap and reliable, just power your cards and risers only off that psu


[11/02/2021 10:00 AM] Wii#9265
That works too


[11/02/2021 10:00 AM] Herk#6019
definitely muuuch cheaper than buying a 1600W psu imo


[11/02/2021 10:00 AM] Herk#6019
and it's also easier to split power across multiple sockets etc.


[11/02/2021 12:04 PM] andee#4722
jumped psu's might make a power cycle unable to get certain amd gpu's back again. but that is really only a concern during tuning


[11/02/2021 12:10 PM] Herk#6019
if they are overloaded maybe?


[11/02/2021 12:10 PM] Herk#6019
I've never experienced that but I try to keep them under 80%


[11/02/2021 1:06 PM] andee#4722
when maxing out rx series cards they can stop responding and a normal system reset does not bring them back. had problems with this when tuning for max hash, had to use the rtc to start the computer 10-30 seconds after shutdown


[11/02/2021 1:07 PM] andee#4722
nvidia have a reset line via pci-e that fixes problems like this on driver level, amd might have added on the latest series but I haven't checked


[11/02/2021 1:40 PM] ercovero#0957
Nanominer inprove over 60% on amd vega they claim, you should try that miner


[11/02/2021 3:27 PM] miner29#2975
Check newegg has it for $379...i prefer the 1600 T2 or 1600 P2 but both are more expensive $600+ / $499+


[11/02/2021 9:05 PM] Salu#0001
Damn really? I get 190mhs on team red


[11/02/2021 9:05 PM] Salu#0001
Thought that was the best


[11/02/2021 9:10 PM] Salu#0001
I've decided to let one of my gpus retire


[11/02/2021 9:10 PM] Salu#0001
And hook up the vega yeah I'm losing hash rate but fuck any power concerns I have


[11/02/2021 9:16 PM] ercovero#0957
Try, ive hot an update on hiveos


[11/03/2021 1:09 AM] Canberry#7404
60% increase on garbage


[11/03/2021 5:21 AM] Salu#0001
huh?


[11/03/2021 5:21 AM] Salu#0001
i get 190 on my vega 64 is that bad?


[11/03/2021 5:22 AM] Salu#0001
oh you meant that miner is garbage..yeah i tried sbminer its shit in terms of hash rate, heard team red is the best for amd cards and yeah can say it is.


[11/03/2021 5:25 AM] Canberry#7404
lol yeah i mean a nanominer 60% increase isnt the same as a TRM 60% increase


[11/03/2021 5:25 AM] Canberry#7404
nano was hashing wayyy lower


[11/03/2021 2:15 PM] Tre#7086
Hi I‚Äôd just like to ask a question. Is ergo mining more profitable or Phoenix miner when eth switches to Pos what to do with gpus?


[11/03/2021 2:17 PM] Tre#7086
I‚Äôm completely new to this and currently mine on Phoenix


[11/03/2021 2:37 PM] Terremot#4855
Pretty decent, I'd say


[11/03/2021 2:37 PM] Terremot#4855
I get 182 on mine.  if I push it further, my rig crashes


[11/03/2021 2:41 PM] Terremot#4855
Not a certainty that ergo will be most profitable when eth goes PoS


[11/03/2021 2:41 PM] Terremot#4855
it's likely the profitability will switch between 3 or 4 coins as people constantly switch coins


[11/03/2021 2:49 PM] Terremot#4855
It all depends if people suddenly start buying up ergo like there's no tomorrow


[11/04/2021 5:04 AM] Sonship#6219

[11/04/2021 8:36 AM] Terremot#4855
It has a section saying "fan speed"


[11/04/2021 8:36 AM] Terremot#4855

[11/04/2021 9:21 AM] Terremot#4855
oh sorry, had just woken up


[11/04/2021 3:40 PM] Sonship#6219
Yes, it is through HeroMiner, and it is currently set to default.


[11/04/2021 6:54 PM] Sonship#6219
The system updated all oft he failed transactions to High, so it looks like we are back up and normal.  Appears it was just a system sync or lag or something, as the blockchain for ERGO had the accurate information even though the wallet wasn't reflecting the same.

should sit above 140 I think


[11/04/2021 9:01 PM] apexpool#3878
I could only do 135 MH/s with 130W


[11/04/2021 9:02 PM] WeeklyOptions#5401
ahhh gotcha


[11/04/2021 9:02 PM] apexpool#3878
no, with 120w


[11/04/2021 9:02 PM] WeeklyOptions#5401
lemme crank the power to 120


[11/04/2021 9:04 PM] apexpool#3878
t-rex, lhr-tune 100
1695 / 2300 / 120w => 135.5 MH/s
1320 / 2300 / 115w => 133.85 MH/s 
-400 / 2300 / 115w => 135.5 MH/s
it might crash with mem clock 2300, you can try 2100 or 2200


[11/04/2021 9:05 PM] WeeklyOptions#5401

hey guys, just wanted to say thank you for the amazing help ive had from this discord, my first mining rig is complete, the first card is a Vega 64 sapphire founders edition with a Morpheus the second is a Vega 64 sapphire nitro+ both flashed to 56s, while the cute one is a asus rx 570 oc, im planning to reapply thermal paste and pads on the nitro and add 120 regular fans (currently running slim ones)

[11/04/2021 11:20 PM] apexpool#3878
no.


[11/04/2021 11:21 PM] apexpool#3878
you should spin the fans a lot more than 33%


[11/04/2021 11:21 PM] Swim#4211
Looks like great specs for power draw. My red dragon eat much more getting 200


[11/04/2021 11:21 PM] apexpool#3878
60% - 70%


[11/04/2021 11:22 PM] apexpool#3878
power draw is much higher in reality, you should add maybe another 60W


[11/04/2021 11:22 PM] Salu#0001
thank you, i was to keep my rig efficient but ambitious, as for thermal head room will reapply and clean paste and pads on the nitro sooner and get bigger fans on the first one

Hey guys, just started mining on my laptop. Recently a few of my shares have been rejected with the error: didn't subscribe. What is the reason for this, and is there a way I can fix this?


[11/05/2021 7:24 PM] SnowPea#7485
If the rejected share rate is lower than 1%, i wouldnt be bothered about it. If its higher, try to lower your OC settings


[11/05/2021 7:27 PM] nadjritzcalod#4055
How can I see the percentage of rejected shares


[11/05/2021 7:30 PM] SnowPea#7485
What miner are you using?


[11/05/2021 7:30 PM] SnowPea#7485
It usually shows R: x%


[11/05/2021 7:31 PM] nadjritzcalod#4055
NBminer


[11/05/2021 8:45 PM] SnowPea#7485
I forgot if the miner shows the percentage, if not, you can also take the total shares and divide it with the rejected shares and you'll get a percentage

He's right, Desktops far outperform laptops. Temps, shrinking every part, different memory etc makes a big diff
Most laptops have very low spec gpu chips not a good dedicated card needed to mine.
Don't fall for marketing traps "X.XX ghz cpu X Gig Ram wow XXXX vRAM" without any mention of more important specs defining trash or treasure

I'd say the best budget cpu on the market is a ryzen 5 1600. Compare that and say, a vega 56 to what your laptop provides on this website. It should make clear the difference by using a point system

[11/08/2021 5:40 PM] andee#4722
Nono, that is over my head üòÖ did it affect performance much on your FPGA?


[11/08/2021 5:41 PM] Wolf9466#6211
Currently, the FPGA miner is broken; it needs a modification for the new epoch. Performance shouldn't be affected, and after it's fixed, it should be good for many more epochs.


[11/08/2021 5:43 PM] Wolf9466#6211
We made height configurable


[11/08/2021 5:43 PM] Wolf9466#6211
But right now, the modulo is an AND mask...


[11/08/2021 5:43 PM] Wolf9466#6211
So yeaaaaah...


[11/08/2021 5:44 PM] Wolf9466#6211
However, a modulo operation, while it will probably increase latency, it should not affect throughput if pipelined well.


[11/08/2021 5:56 PM] apexpool#3878
tell it to the TRM developers please üòÇ 
we are suffering here with the HBM cards


[11/08/2021 5:56 PM] Wolf9466#6211
You can't do it on a GPU. Further, I believe the hit they took on hashrate has little to do with the modulo


[11/08/2021 5:57 PM] Wolf9466#6211
I believe the optimizations which were hurt on GPU using TRM has to do with them (probably, this is speculation) using four copies of the dataset in memory, which they are no longer able to do in an 8GB space.


[11/08/2021 5:57 PM] apexpool#3878
do you think they can optimize in a future release?


[11/08/2021 5:57 PM] Wolf9466#6211

[11/08/2021 5:58 PM] Wolf9466#6211
People don't realize - hashrate is going down for EVERYONE - not just you. What happens when nethash drops? Difficulty drops.


[11/08/2021 5:59 PM] Wolf9466#6211
Hence, while profitability has taken a short-term hit - that's exactly what it will be: short-term.


[11/08/2021 5:59 PM] apexpool#3878
it did not go down for non-HBM cards.


[11/08/2021 5:59 PM] Wolf9466#6211
That interes- oh.


[11/08/2021 5:59 PM] Wolf9466#6211

[11/08/2021 5:59 PM] Wolf9466#6211
They don't have enough core power to service four copies, maybe...


[11/08/2021 6:00 PM] Wolf9466#6211
Still, MANY people are mining with Vega GPUs, and I believe diff will fall some. Also, have you seen the price? xD


[11/08/2021 6:01 PM] apexpool#3878
yes, but that's probably because of 1. ErgoDEX and 2. BTC (more because of 1.)


[11/08/2021 6:01 PM] Wolf9466#6211
And this should raise profitability if it holds, and I think it will.


[11/08/2021 6:03 PM] apexpool#3878
they should release ErgoDEX ASAP on Cardano. That would be HUGE.


[11/08/2021 6:03 PM] apexpool#3878
if they do it before other DEX projects.


[11/08/2021 6:04 PM] apexpool#3878
people cannot wait for a DEX. if ErgoDEX will be the first one and if it will have success, the ERG price will rise.

[11/08/2021 8:23 PM] Swim#4211
This whole memory over 8 gig issue... 
Does this mean my Vega 56's were a bad investment & are now nerfed vs cards with more than 8GB vRAM?


[11/08/2021 8:24 PM] Swim#4211
Are high vRAM cards uneffected by this?


[11/08/2021 8:50 PM] Wolf9466#6211
Not really, it's applying to many cards.


[11/08/2021 8:51 PM] Wolf9466#6211
I have a VII, and my hashrate with TRM dropped from 280MH/s -> 225MH/s

as you can see, each card is different. the first 2 are identical, but very different while mining.


[11/08/2021 10:50 PM] apexpool#3878
I'm not sure how much you can get from a Vega 56 on ETH, but I am happy with this.

you can see all the values in the picture


[11/08/2021 10:52 PM] apexpool#3878
coreMHZ is Core Clock, MemMHZ is Memory Clock, VDDC is Core Voltage.


[11/08/2021 10:53 PM] apexpool#3878
and the amdmemtweak the default ones for Hynix / Samsung (Asus Rox Strix -> Hynix, Sapphire Pulse -> Samsung - that's why it takes higher memory clock)


[11/08/2021 10:53 PM] apexpool#3878
I tested more than 6 hours today to get there.


[11/08/2021 10:54 PM] apexpool#3878
higher core clock and core voltage will slightly increase the hashrate.

[11/08/2021 10:58 PM] apexpool#3878
it is too hot and it uses way too much power because you give them too much voltage.


[11/08/2021 10:58 PM] apexpool#3878
when you change the settings, you should stop the miner first.


[11/08/2021 10:58 PM] apexpool#3878

they will be fine.  Not much force with those fans.  The duct tape has the issue of the adhesive softening due to the gpu heat generation.  But the weight is not much and the force of the fan will be substantially less than the tinsel strength of the zip ties.  üòâ

did you try powering it with the cables from the other gpu?


[11/12/2021 10:19 PM] Swim#4211
I think so but I'll have to double check. The main problem is the fans dont spin on the broken one, but they do on the working red dragon yet they both still light up

The GPU end of the pcie cable's lower 3 pins were darkened & a little bit of plasic was melted on the corner pins


[11/13/2021 11:19 AM] Swim#4211
Lucky for me I've saw many threads where people buy different cables to their stock PSU's cable & end up breaking expensive things so I know to buy the manufacturers only


[11/13/2021 12:24 PM] andee#4722
I had the same thing happen once, but on PSU side. I suspect the pin in the corner that started to melt was poorly seated

per the mining guide, Ergo Stratum Proxy is listed as a prereq. When I go to download the EXE for v1.2.1, my antivirus marks it as containing a virus (Trojan-PSW.Win32.Disco.ctp). Is this potentially a case of my antivirus being overly exuberant? Or did a trojan somehow end up in that EXE? (I have also logged an issue on the github itself: https://github.com/mhssamadani/ErgoStratumProxy/issues/23;  but figured pinging here would be helpful as well)

thank you for response. yes im running up to date program. so I dont think that is the cause.


[11/15/2021 2:20 AM] andee#4722
does it say why they are rejected? is it because they are stale or invalid? looks like nanominer only shows accepted/rejected

[11/15/2021 5:32 AM] Salu#0001
guys what are some good longevity temps for Vega 64s? i know safe is below 80c on mem but i just want to be anal about this, what a beyond safe temp measure, i can get 65c on mem and 45c on core but i have to max fans
15 November 2021
so my solution is let core rise to 53 and let mem sit the same at 65c this is auto fan in hiveos
what do you guys think, i want to run my vegas "cold" to ensure theyll run for many years to come
the top one cant run past 42% since the noctua fans on it only max at 2k rpm, so please correct my logic if im wrong...set temp higher> if room gets warmer> fans have more head room to cool> keeping gpu temp consistent in the event of heat build up
any advice appreciated

you need to update to the latest version, and it will work, but with 25%-30% lower hashrate.

I redirect people here when I notice it. if you were here during the real rush of new people you would have seen that it was impossible to even read what was written in #‚õè‚îÇmining because it was a wall of questions and answers going on constantly making actual talk about mining impossible in between people answering the same questions over and over

[11/16/2021 12:47 AM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
Here's my problem. I have flashed hiveos, hooked up everything except video cards. Hiveos won't boot up properly on my mining rig but still shows it connected in hiveos. Basically I changed bios settings that I was supposed to change and when I go to boot I get the blue screen on computer with the 4 options including boot hiveos. Once thats selected the screen times out and goes black then the check cable on monitor pops up. I am successfully seeing it connected in Hoveos on other computer.


[11/16/2021 12:48 AM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
I was told to go ahead and hook up the video card. And to even have hdmi go directly in back. Same exact issue and now it shows in hiveos that I have my videocard recognized. Why am I unable to get hiveos booted up properly on rig? I'm using a ATA Kingston 120GB SSD


[11/16/2021 3:49 AM] tictacpat#2117

[11/16/2021 8:30 AM] andee#4722
its specific to hiveos, so you are much better off asking there. but if the rig is online and the gpu is recognized, why dont you just start filling the rig and start mining? you dont manage it through a screen and keyboard connected to the rig

Something like this should work. You don‚Äôt need to mine on nanopool though, it‚Äôs just my preference that will most def draw some heat üôÇ for the extra config arguments in the last screenshot you *must* input exactly as many parameters as many cards you have. So if you have 1, it should be 92. If you have three, then 92,92,92 etc.


[11/16/2021 12:07 PM] Attila#3944
Also if you have an iphone and type in the ‚Äú character it‚Äôs not gonna be accepted by hiveos. See the difference: ‚Äú vs " - use the latter. If you use desktop to access hiveos or android, this won‚Äôt be an issue.

Fluctuation is fine


[11/16/2021 11:24 PM] Attila#3944
My gigabyte cards mine between 150-157


[11/16/2021 11:24 PM] Attila#3944
Depending on what they are doing in the mining cycle


[11/16/2021 11:25 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
So how long until I see ergo go into wallet? Need to make sure that's set up properly too


[11/16/2021 11:26 PM] Attila#3944
Where are you mining, which pool?


[11/16/2021 11:27 PM] Attila#3944
If you go to your pool‚Äôs website and search there for your wallet address you‚Äôll find a way to see and set your payout limits


[11/16/2021 11:28 PM] Attila#3944
I mine to nanopool so I have to go to ergo.nanopool.org


[11/16/2021 11:28 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
That's what I did nanopool on east

[11/16/2021 11:30 PM] Attila#3944
Once there you click settings


[11/16/2021 11:31 PM] Attila#3944
And there, once your miner has some rating, which might take around 20-30 minutes, you‚Äôll be able to set a payout limit


[11/16/2021 11:31 PM] Attila#3944
I think it‚Äôs maybe 1 by default


[11/16/2021 11:31 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
I'm on desktop


[11/16/2021 11:31 PM] Attila#3944
You can do that on desktop too


[11/16/2021 11:31 PM] Attila#3944
No difference


[11/16/2021 11:31 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
I don't see settings though


[11/16/2021 11:31 PM] Attila#3944
Ctrl+f on the page and type settings


[11/16/2021 11:32 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
Connection settings. Shows Europe usa other pools


[11/16/2021 11:33 PM] Attila#3944
Are you on ergo.nanopool.org/account/your_wallet_id?


[11/16/2021 11:33 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
I see it


[11/16/2021 11:34 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
So click on settings it wants an email and min payout


[11/16/2021 11:34 PM] Attila#3944
Yes


[11/16/2021 11:34 PM] Attila#3944
The email has to be the same that you inputted on your flight sheet


[11/16/2021 11:35 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
Don't think I put an email


[11/16/2021 11:35 PM] Attila#3944
Then leave it blank


[11/16/2021 11:35 PM] Attila#3944
And just set the payout limit to whatever you see fit


[11/16/2021 11:36 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
Ok.


[11/16/2021 11:36 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
It wants a password(email) so just type a password there?


[11/16/2021 11:36 PM] Attila#3944
Just leave it blank


[11/16/2021 11:37 PM] Attila#3944
What you inputted on your flight sheet


[11/16/2021 11:37 PM] Attila#3944
Governs this field


[11/16/2021 11:37 PM] Attila#3944
If you want to make changes the two have to match - whether they‚Äôre blank or not


[11/16/2021 11:37 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
So I think I just put kdawg5884 as "wallet"


[11/16/2021 11:37 PM] Attila#3944
Did you not input a wallet address?


[11/16/2021 11:38 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
So it gave wallet address then name (enter wallet name)


[11/16/2021 11:38 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
Yes and a name of kdawg5884
Source I put yoroi even though it wasn't an option


[11/16/2021 11:38 PM] Attila#3944
That‚Äôs fine


[11/16/2021 11:38 PM] Attila#3944
That‚Äôs not relevant now


[11/16/2021 11:39 PM] Attila#3944
On your flight sheet when setting up nanopool there is an email field


[11/16/2021 11:39 PM] Attila#3944
You don‚Äôt actually need to input an email in there, you can write anything


[11/16/2021 11:39 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
I see it.


[11/16/2021 11:40 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
So that I put email and match to account in ergo nanopool


[11/16/2021 11:41 PM] Attila#3944
Exactly


[11/16/2021 11:41 PM] Attila#3944
So then on your account website you can change payment frequency


[11/16/2021 11:41 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
Maybe not. Now it says incorrect password. So I put in the email though right? The one I just set on flight sheet under pool?


[11/16/2021 11:42 PM] Attila#3944
There might be two reasons for that


[11/16/2021 11:42 PM] Attila#3944
One is that your workers don‚Äôt have a rating yet


[11/16/2021 11:43 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
My flight sheet now shoes my email address in it


[11/16/2021 11:43 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
As long as I get paid in wallet it doesn't matter lol


[11/16/2021 11:43 PM] Attila#3944
The website actually tells you that if your worker hasn‚Äôt been working long enough then its rating is low and it will show incorrect password


[11/16/2021 11:43 PM] Attila#3944

are these hashrates before the dag change? I can only get to 132 when i try them


[11/17/2021 12:50 AM] Pharotek#2932
do mind shareing your tweak config with me?


[11/17/2021 12:59 AM] Pharotek#2932
they changed the dag file, so vegas are nerfed it seems a lot ppl are chaning over to low power setting, i'm experimenting now too with it

Test vectors for increased N values
On block 614,400 memory requirements of Autolykos2 will be increased. Miners are talking about ‚ÄúDAG size increase‚Äù, however, in case of Ergo this is not about a DAG, rather, a table.  Dear miner software developers, please check the following test vector for valid PoW solutions for height 614,400 (with low diff of 16,384):   height: 614400 N: 70...


[11/17/2021 7:14 AM] Wolf9466#6211
IMO, that's... not a great test vector from a miner-side view


[11/17/2021 7:29 AM] andee#4722
I just posted it because of the continued talk about DAG. what makes it not great as a test?


[11/17/2021 7:32 AM] Wolf9466#6211
Well, two things bug me - I dunno wtf b, pk or n is (I know the whitepaper describes it, but honestly, I was never able to understand the exact notation of the whitepaper, and I've implemented Autolykos v2 four or five times), it doesn't have any intermediate values (if you look at the test vectors for, say, AES - they have outputs for every round, to ease developer debugging), and I don't see a full hash result (unless that's pk, but it doesn't look like it has enough leading zeros...)


[11/17/2021 8:13 AM] Wolf9466#6211
With my test vector, I tried to provide this by giving test outputs: http://docs.ergoplatform.org/dev/protocol/autolykos/#test-vectors-for-solution-verification


[11/17/2021 1:07 PM] Pharotek#2932

Top 3 are rx cards


[11/17/2021 1:10 PM] Pharotek#2932
Still double the hash at lower power cost then having rx cards, but dam i miss that extra 40-55hashrate


[11/17/2021 2:08 PM] andee#4722
I dont think your undervolting is applied to those cards if it was not during a spike.  <900mV should not be 90W

[11/17/2021 2:12 PM] Swim#4211
Thanks. It's prob very obvious but it's good to make 100% certain.


[11/17/2021 2:13 PM] Swim#4211
Thinking of getting this unit, but the voltage is a bit low even thought its Gold rated. How many vega 56 cards do you think it could hande? Im guessing 3 only maybe just 4


[11/17/2021 2:14 PM] Swim#4211
Also is gamemax a cancerous brand? I've had a gamemax burn out a pcie cable & unable to get a spare


[11/17/2021 2:17 PM] andee#4722
no idea, all I know is that my RX xxx cards pull around 30% extra when creating table for new block


[11/17/2021 2:20 PM] apexpool#3878
I have 3 Vega56 cards on a 850w PSU. I don't have cables for more. I am sure 4 will be OK.


[11/17/2021 2:20 PM] Swim#4211
I don't have electronics to measure yet but im guessing if my cards pull 165w and the slot pulls another 50w thats already 215 per card plus the board and fans & HDD. I think going 1k minimum is probably best


[11/17/2021 2:20 PM] Swim#4211
Nice but you also have famously low wattage per card right?


[11/17/2021 2:21 PM] apexpool#3878
does your card really pull 165w?


[11/17/2021 2:21 PM] Swim#4211
I mine on windows OS & that's what the miner & amd driver says


[11/17/2021 2:21 PM] apexpool#3878
it also depends on the card, 2 of my cards have the power cap at 220w, the third at 165w.


[11/17/2021 2:21 PM] Swim#4211
Althought I get frustrated spending all day trying to fiddle and find the best effeciency for the wattage


[11/17/2021 2:21 PM] Swim#4211
I sort of gave up and used some stock straps & general oc


[11/17/2021 2:22 PM] Swim#4211
cards are so sensitive and different on each level of power


[11/17/2021 2:22 PM] apexpool#3878
you only need to spend half a day once üôÇ


[11/17/2021 2:22 PM] Swim#4211
Any pro tips?


[11/17/2021 2:22 PM] apexpool#3878
correct. I have 2 identical cards that are so different...


[11/17/2021 2:23 PM] Swim#4211
I was thinking maybe getting it to the right power level first, then trying to change things in a confusing order


[11/17/2021 2:23 PM] Swim#4211
Maybe I should just cave and install hiveos


[11/17/2021 2:24 PM] apexpool#3878
just spend time with an google sheet docs in front of you and write down all the settings. start from 750mv and 900 core clock and increase them little by little when it crashes, and write the results in the spreadsheet.


[11/17/2021 2:25 PM] Swim#4211
ok but what about memory and memory voltage

thanks il give it more of a go


[11/17/2021 2:27 PM] apexpool#3878
you are welcome. and always stop the miner when changing settings and restart it after

Will an invalid shares error go away once I get oc settings right? Or do I go somewhere to clear it out?

3 max... dont push ur psu too hard...


[11/17/2021 2:43 PM] Swim#4211
So it's probably worth it to spend the extra ¬£20 on a 1k watt PSU

ah nvm its ¬£45+ more minimum


[11/17/2021 2:44 PM] Pharotek#2932
I would say so, all the cards in my screen shot are all on a 900w psu


[11/17/2021 2:45 PM] Swim#4211
You need to update your miner Sir


[11/17/2021 2:46 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
It's like 16 hrs old so do I need to update daily?


[11/17/2021 2:47 PM] Pharotek#2932
No you don't, keep turning


[11/17/2021 2:47 PM] Pharotek#2932
It will show the old invalid but you should stop getting new ones


[11/17/2021 2:47 PM] Swim#4211
Ah my mistake. That's the only time I was getting invalid shares


[11/17/2021 2:48 PM] Pharotek#2932
Rebooting the miner will clear the old invalids


[11/17/2021 2:48 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
But when you get the card / rig right does error go away immediately?


[11/17/2021 2:49 PM] Pharotek#2932
Once it completed a job yes


[11/17/2021 2:49 PM] Pharotek#2932

They are pretty much the same 5x 6+2 or cpu modular slots both gold rated

Get a breakout board for 15$ and 1200w hp server psu for 65$, it will need 220v for full 1200w otherwise its only 900


[11/17/2021 3:09 PM] Pharotek#2932
In end it depends on how many card plan to run if less then 8 and plan to undervolt and motherboard+extra fans need

[11/17/2021 3:11 PM] Swim#4211
It seems like a great idea. My only concern is buying a used one & it being the old silver kind


[11/17/2021 3:11 PM] Pharotek#2932
Yep, and if need their are other boards with 24pin


[11/17/2021 3:11 PM] Swim#4211
So I could use an old psu with no pcie to run the system but plug all cards into this bad boy?


[11/17/2021 3:12 PM] Pharotek#2932
I use those and BTC-S37 BOARD riserless I love it


[11/17/2021 3:12 PM] Swim#4211
Thanks for the insight. Im using a b450m a pro max board


[11/17/2021 3:12 PM] Pharotek#2932
Yes, those boards alao have 4 pin plug so whwn your atx psu kicks on ut trigger it to power on


[11/17/2021 3:14 PM] Swim#4211
Where do I get the cables for the hp server psu to connect to the cards?


[11/17/2021 3:14 PM] Swim#4211
I was warned about using other brand cables


[11/17/2021 3:17 PM] Pharotek#2932
I get them from Amazon


[11/17/2021 3:18 PM] Pharotek#2932
Parallelminers makes a really nice board+24pin+cables but its like 65


[11/17/2021 3:18 PM] Swim#4211
ah yes, I see them on ebay too black and yellow


[11/17/2021 3:19 PM] Pharotek#2932
Yep can get splitters also for cards that have 2-3 hookups


[11/17/2021 3:19 PM] Pharotek#2932

[11/17/2021 3:20 PM] Pharotek#2932
If go that route use these boards, don't use ones with a on/off button. They don't self power on well at all say after power outtage


[11/17/2021 3:20 PM] Swim#4211
Looks v good but cant shake the worry of buying a used psu


[11/17/2021 3:21 PM] Swim#4211
I only have 3 vega 56 atm but it sure would future proof


[11/17/2021 3:21 PM] Pharotek#2932
Just cheaper, is all


[11/17/2021 3:21 PM] Pharotek#2932
How many cards do plan on that board?


[11/17/2021 3:22 PM] Swim#4211
With this thing you would connect 1:1 two cables per vega right?


[11/17/2021 3:22 PM] Swim#4211
I can get up to 6 and also have another older pc I can connect another 3 or 4


[11/17/2021 3:22 PM] Swim#4211
but in time. I'd need to use some mining rewards on purse.io to get it with crypto


[11/17/2021 3:23 PM] Pharotek#2932
That 1000w would be ideal for you ut seems


[11/17/2021 3:23 PM] Swim#4211
I thinking of just getting the CM at the moment to run my pc and then a server 1200 in future when I have more cards


[11/17/2021 3:23 PM] Swim#4211
whats ut?


[11/17/2021 3:23 PM] Pharotek#2932
With hp server, will need access to 220v


[11/17/2021 3:23 PM] Pharotek#2932
To get full power


[11/17/2021 3:24 PM] Swim#4211
my country is 220v standard


[11/17/2021 3:24 PM] Pharotek#2932
Ah


[11/17/2021 3:24 PM] Swim#4211
at least I think thats the way it goes


[11/17/2021 3:24 PM] Swim#4211
UK resident


[11/17/2021 3:24 PM] Pharotek#2932
Could also get  two psu and on one use the 24pin jumper


[11/17/2021 3:25 PM] Pharotek#2932
But that 1000w should do everything you need


[11/17/2021 3:25 PM] Swim#4211
its bad to get another 850w for now? its almost 50% cheaper


[11/17/2021 3:25 PM] Pharotek#2932
Nope


[11/17/2021 3:25 PM] Swim#4211
I could buy 2x 1000w or 3x 850w for same price


[11/17/2021 3:26 PM] Swim#4211
almost


[11/17/2021 3:26 PM] Pharotek#2932
Can latter on get a cheapo 650, jumper the 24pin and use pcie cables


[11/17/2021 3:26 PM] Swim#4211
Yes


[11/17/2021 3:26 PM] Swim#4211

I will gave say though, the riserless boards I have are epic for small time mining, no falling risers


[11/17/2021 3:28 PM] Pharotek#2932
And fit nicely in server case


[11/17/2021 3:28 PM] Swim#4211
That was one of my first problem. Had to hammer out my case for red dragons to fit


[11/17/2021 3:29 PM] Swim#4211
They are weak aluminium rivets that come off easy when hammered with a pin but its very scary with my stuff inside


[11/17/2021 3:29 PM] Swim#4211
then when i got 2nd card, side case did not fit anymore, needed thin fans

[11/17/2021 3:32 PM] Pharotek#2932
I've had my btc-s37 for years no issues, I tried the ondaga board it sucked


[11/17/2021 3:33 PM] Pharotek#2932
Noctia fans are best fans on market in my opinion


[11/17/2021 3:33 PM] Swim#4211
Looks like a nice board, I'll have to remember it If I get the chance to snowball onto a new rig in future


[11/17/2021 3:33 PM] Pharotek#2932
There are 3 versions


[11/17/2021 3:33 PM] Swim#4211
I wanted to have a board I could use as a normal pc too. Not too smart considering I just use my laptop mostly for that


[11/17/2021 3:33 PM] Swim#4211
Nice to have the potential to max spec game tho


[11/17/2021 3:33 PM] Pharotek#2932
D37 needs 24 pin and spacing is only 55mm


[11/17/2021 3:34 PM] Swim#4211
That's close


[11/17/2021 3:34 PM] Pharotek#2932
S37 doesn't need 24pin and 65mm spacing, why I use the hp server pau with breakout board.


[11/17/2021 3:35 PM] Swim#4211
Sounds like the superior board. So how is it powered if not by 24 pin

You will have invalids very likely no matter what. I personally don‚Äôt care until at least 99.5% of the shares I mine are valid. No big deal.

[11/17/2021 5:27 PM] Attila#3944
If a card spits out a ton of invalid shares it‚Äôs a good idea to bring down its memory clock. So if it‚Äôs 2650 for example get it down to 2600. If it‚Äôs still producing a ton of invalid shares go down to 2550. Maybe add a few watts to power limit.

Anyone know the Linux command to allow Nvidia cards to overclock beyond normal setpoint? Hiveos let's me overclock memory to something like (at least) 10800, but if I use nvidia-settings on the CLI it seems stuck at 9800 or so..

This is what I did after reading a bit about it. I lowered my memory clock and core each down 50. So I've only had the 1 invalid and it's been running 18 hrs now so no big deal? Should I put setting back?


[11/17/2021 6:46 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
Also when will the red error be removed?


[11/17/2021 7:16 PM] Attila#3944
Don‚Äôt worry about it. If you start getting invalid shares to an extent that your percentage goes below 99% I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a significant loss already


[11/17/2021 7:16 PM] Attila#3944

Hi, developers, please help me figure out the situation. How can I figure out if I got the block in solo or not? Mined ERGO on the pool woolypooly.com the logminer showed the accepted share, the complexity is higher than the network. At the same time, another miner found the block.

block 621836


[11/18/2021 9:25 AM] andee#4722
it was mined by wooly, but someone else could have submitted the solution first


[11/18/2021 9:27 AM] vlad555#4636
then I would have a reject? is not it so?


[11/18/2021 9:31 AM] andee#4722
it would not be rejected, but if the pool had moved on to the next block it would have been stale


[11/18/2021 9:33 AM] andee#4722
if your solution came 1ms after the one who found the block you will get accepted share, but only the first will be rewarded


[11/18/2021 9:33 AM] vlad555#4636
Are you a moderator here? do you know how the timred miner works?


[11/18/2021 9:34 AM] andee#4722
you will have to ask the dev about that. I know how to use it, I dont have the source


[11/18/2021 9:38 AM] vlad555#4636
That's why I'm asking for developers' help. I wrote to the developer in the miner of timred, he explained to me if the share is recorded in the top statistics, it is not stale and not rejected. You still look at the time of the block and my share, the share are taken up to a second before the block, that is, in fact, there is a block that I have been assigned dishonestly.

Andy, I don't want to offend you, you're wasting your time, I myself don't understand how ERGO mining works in detail, the developers will explain more precisely, the mining goes with a shift of 1, see the time of block 37th


[11/18/2021 9:42 AM] andee#4722
this block is around the time of your share, but was found by nanopool

[11/18/2021 9:42 AM] vlad555#4636
look at the time of the next block, and if you are interested, ask the developers about it, the developer timred miner explained it to me, I can't re-transmit


[11/18/2021 9:43 AM] andee#4722
what about it? it was accepted one second after you submitted your share


[11/18/2021 9:43 AM] andee#4722
probably less, since the miner does not show ms


[11/18/2021 9:45 AM] vlad555#4636
let the developers answer if it's not difficult for them, I don't want to argue with you, because of this second.


[11/18/2021 9:46 AM] andee#4722
what do you expect them to answer? someone submitted the solution before you, nanopool mined the block you found a solution for


[11/18/2021 9:46 AM] andee#4722
#621836 was mined 56 seconds before you found the share


[11/18/2021 9:46 AM] vlad555#4636
that's where you're right, maybe less. perhaps my ball was 12 sec 900 m s, and the block was announced 13 sec 050 ms

nanopool may have extracted the 35 block, why so ask the developers, I myself do not understand why the numbering is going like this


[11/18/2021 9:51 AM] andee#4722
how does this not match what I said? I said that wooly mined that block. look at the timestamp in the explorer

[11/18/2021 9:52 AM] andee#4722
minute is rounded up to 47. block was mined at 46:16


[11/18/2021 9:53 AM] andee#4722
so its impossible that you mined it unless the clock your miner is using is wrong


[11/18/2021 9:53 AM] vlad555#4636
I'll repeat myself again if you don't know (as in other things I do) do not argue better, but ask the developers about the numbering of blocks. Right now I'll send a quote


[11/18/2021 9:56 AM] andee#4722
I know what the explorer and your screenshot says. your share was submitted 56 seconds after the block wooly mined


[11/18/2021 9:56 AM] vlad555#4636
well, the timestamp is snapped when the previous block was accepted
no pool wants to change the block header after that since then miners would need to rebuild the ergo pad on gpus more often
Right now the top block is 622053, but if you start a miner, you'll see that you build the pad for height 622054.
So, when you found that share, you were working on height 621836. One second after you submitted the share, a new pool job is sent out building the pad for height 621837.


[11/18/2021 9:58 AM] vlad555#4636
it's useless, you're probably a representative of this pool üòÇ


[11/18/2021 10:16 AM] andee#4722
I was wrong about the timestamp, sorry


[11/18/2021 10:17 AM] vlad555#4636
it's okay, it's much more unpleasant that I may have been assigned a block worth about 500-600 dollars


[11/18/2021 10:18 AM] vlad555#4636
I hope the developers will say their opinion. it is very unclear to them who the money for this block went to.


[11/18/2021 10:19 AM] andee#4722
if you are serious about solo mining you should try setting up your own node, then you will only need to trust that you are able to keep it running. zero fees and no one can take it from you


[11/18/2021 10:19 AM] andee#4722

I have too few cards, it was more of a roulette game, and I was "lucky" to get a block, about luck was 16-18%

consistently one of the better pools IMO


[11/18/2021 9:31 PM] SnowPea#7485
Hi guys, its been a while. I've recently bought a pcie splitter and hooked four gpus to it. It worked well right away and went for about 15 days without any issues. Then one morning i found that 3 of the gpu fans were not spinning but the rig was still on. I restarted the rig and connected a monitor to the one thats still spinning and found that the other 3 gpus went "not recognized" in device manager.


[11/18/2021 9:32 PM] SnowPea#7485
Tried a few things but at the end the splitter only recognized 3 out of 4 gpus so I put the 4th one on its own riser. It was working fine for the past 29 hours. Just want to see if anyone had similar experience with your splitter?


[11/18/2021 9:34 PM] SnowPea#7485
This is the splitter I got, if you have any other recommendations like another brand of splitter, I'm all ear.

[11/18/2021 10:28 PM] miner29#2975
I would test each gpu and riser with the splitter one at a time.  Then try it with 2 and then 3 and then 4.  As soon as one doesnt work.  (say gpu4) shut down and plug 4 into the 1 position and 1 into the 4.  Restart and see if you still only see 3 and that the one now on the 4 position is not there.  By doing this process with each piece (splitter / cables / risers / gpus) you can get down to whats failing.  Could be splitter....could be cables or a riser or a gpu....


[11/18/2021 10:28 PM] miner29#2975
Ive not had one fail since i started using them in 2018...but is possible.  May also be a riser or cable (no edge cards here but they fail too).


[11/18/2021 10:29 PM] miner29#2975
Be sure you also try swapping power plugs around as a single plug with a faulty pin can cause same problem.


[11/18/2021 11:02 PM] SnowPea#7485
Thanks for the recommendations, I will spend some time to test them out tonight!


[11/18/2021 11:05 PM] miner29#2975
find the bad part by process of elimination.  Then get rid of it and replace it.....not worth the trouble of faulty piece.


[11/18/2021 11:06 PM] SnowPea#7485
Yea, its such a headache trying to hunt down the bad part in a rig


[11/18/2021 11:07 PM] SnowPea#7485
Oh one other question, i know that its very important to use only the cables that comes with the psu, but how about the 8pin splitters? my psu doesnt come with any 8 pin splitters, and i bought one to connect to a single 8pin cable came with the psu


[11/19/2021 6:37 AM] andee#4722
the pinout will match as long as there has been no errors during manufacturing. its easy to check that its correct though. depending on how you use it they can melt or start a fire


[11/19/2021 7:08 AM] geezar#8187
@SnowPea agree with miner. I first used these in 2018 also to start a basic rig based on an office PC. I had one DOA, one that would only ever detect 3 GPU and one that recognised 4 then would drop a GPU intermittently.  Lost count of the time lost trying to determine what combo would work. The newer splitters may work better but I accepted 3/4 worked and moved on. Lost many hours - just sharing as I had the same experience.


[11/19/2021 8:15 AM] andee#4722

The Black one looks to have a MUCH better heat sink on the plex chip.  The blue ones i have all are marked V002 the black ones dont appear to have that marking but do make a nice kit.  At least the one on Amazon.  At $21 its cheaper than most of them...but ive had good luck with the S-Union stuff both these boards and break out boards and cables.  YMMV.  I paid $7.99 for mine back in 2018/19....now $21-$36 for the same things.


[11/19/2021 5:41 PM] Swim#4211
If you use multiple PSU, does it matter which one you power the risers from?


[11/19/2021 5:41 PM] Swim#4211
I heard off one guy that the risers need to be powered from the same psu running the system but idk if its true or not


[11/19/2021 5:42 PM] apexpool#3878
I am powering each riser from the same PSU as the card in it.


[11/19/2021 5:44 PM] Swim#4211
Ok, my plan is to run the system, 1 card & 1 riser  from a good 550w , then have my other cards run from a much more powerful PSU so I can add more easily later. Is this viable?

Make sure you only edit exactly the address & your wallet. If in doubt re download TRM or whichever miner your using & try again


[11/22/2021 11:51 AM] Swim#4211
If the pool is playing up or to iron out the possibility, try hero miners address. I've had np since I started with them


[11/22/2021 11:53 AM] Swim#4211
Alternatively, the majority of security software do like to flag miners as a false positive. Go into windows firewall & all your anti malware security software and create an exception for TRM's folder on the whitelist

[11/25/2021 12:40 PM] apexpool#3878
ETH and ERG have different algorithms, you will not be able to convert an eth miner (assuming that's a device) to mine ergo.


[11/25/2021 12:45 PM] FiveHive#7633

[11/25/2021 1:25 PM] andee#4722
pandaminer looks like a gpu miner, so that would work


[11/25/2021 1:46 PM] geezar#8187
Yep same principle as a server rack case - if memory serves me those came with very loud intake/exhaust fans due to the GPU's not having native fan shrouds - so whilst being good for airflow, would be loud for domestic applications - the 4GB and 8GB RX470's would just hash the same as a standard polaris build They were just sold as a complete unit with OS - no different to a rig build.


[11/25/2021 1:47 PM] geezar#8187
Same build could be achieved with a server rack case, riserless mobo and a couple of GPU's - if you can score one at a good price quick way to have a full rig but not different to a DIY build


[11/25/2021 1:47 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289

[11/25/2021 2:00 PM] geezar#8187
Basic heat management and making things work in a domestic situation hard to beat - there comes a point when you add more GPU's it gets a bit silly - basic 4" ducting with non active intakes even for a single rig 1KW to 2KW will make life a lot easier - even a single 400 CFM exhaust fan. Feels a lot of hassle but 24/7 mining and heat management start to become a pain, sure some on here have much larger requirements but heat management even in a cold climate can get old quick


[11/25/2021 3:13 PM] andee#4722
~2KW of GPU's keeps 130m2 of my basement at 23-25c, and its -1 Celsius outside now

14-1500 core and as high as memory goes


[11/27/2021 4:12 PM] geezar#8187
Best place for them is ETH IMO due to the fact they will hash in the 44-46 MH/s range. but 2 examples below - most will run 132-136 range on this algo - some will hit early 150's (Hynix) as andee suggests. Crank the mem until it BSOD's or crashes.. annoying GPU's for sure

[11/27/2021 8:40 PM] andee#4722
if you are willing to sacrifice a couple MH you can probably drop wattage by 25-35W


[11/28/2021 11:11 AM] geezar#8187
If your looking for efficiency the 1150/2100/110 range works well - LHR can be tricky but 92 to around 94 seems a sweet spot. That said on some you can disable LHR mode and they still hash well.. annoying and better sold on lol


[11/28/2021 11:13 AM] geezar#8187
133MH/s around 1150/2050/110 but they all differ, the 150 MH/s take 135w.. so no where near as good as Samsung but hell... life sucks especially with Hynix GPU


[11/28/2021 11:32 AM] andee#4722

you should always run a miner with 1 or more failovers


[12/01/2021 12:44 AM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
So I just shutdown my miner to install a 6th vid card. One of my cards had stayed steady at 48-50 degrees lower than all the others by about 3-4 degrees. It's fan was also lower than the rest. Anyway once I got new card installed and fired up that same card has since shot up to 60 degrees with no changes made to that card. What's the reasoning behind this?


[12/01/2021 6:33 AM] andee#4722
where does the exhaust of the newly installed card go? more heat and different airflow


[12/01/2021 7:35 AM] Herk#6019
don't be afraid to increase your fan speeds


[12/01/2021 11:21 AM] shinyumbreon#2454
Shoulda gone to wooly


[12/01/2021 12:50 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
The 6th one is 2 cards away from the one mentioned above. I would think it would affect the one next to it before it affected others.


[12/01/2021 12:51 PM] Attila#3944
More cards, less space for the air to go away. Normal


[12/01/2021 12:52 PM] Attila#3944
Just fire your new arctic fans up and enjoy the silence üôÇ I could reduce most of my cards to 70% fan speed after I got my rig fans going


[12/01/2021 12:52 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511

[12/01/2021 12:55 PM] Attila#3944
I might actually flip my two rigs. Unfortunately they‚Äôre situated in a corner where one blows its heat on the other. The one with the two ‚Äúweak‚Äù thermal cards is the one that gets the brunt of the heat


[12/01/2021 1:09 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
So after 9 days of running well one of my cards stopped working and had 3 red z's stacked on eachother I'm assuming means sleeping. I powered down and back up and all fine. What causes this? How do I prevent it?  I tried looking online and didn't get any info about it.


[12/01/2021 1:10 PM] Attila#3944
That‚Äôs part of the game, don‚Äôt worry too much about it


[12/01/2021 1:10 PM] Attila#3944
If it happens all the time then reduce memory overclock a little and/or increase power limit

[12/01/2021 1:11 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511

Is that set through watchdog?


[12/01/2021 1:12 PM] Attila#3944
That‚Äôs kind of the point - if it crashes it just recovers


[12/01/2021 1:13 PM] Attila#3944
In watchdog you set failsafes for when your hashrate drops below a threshold


[12/01/2021 1:13 PM] Attila#3944

Try setting the GPU fan on that GPU to 10 to identify it, maybe the bus order has been altered. Either way the airflow and added heat can cause this

looks like ill hit Roi somtime before june, not bad tbh


[12/02/2021 4:59 PM] andee#4722
use memtweak, nb and t-rex has this built in but it has to be enabled


[12/02/2021 5:55 PM] Salu#0001
gonna try that when i have the gpu in hand

What causes a mining rig to just go offline. I've had it happen I think 4 times now. First time was after a minute and a half after booting up. Another time was after about 5-6 min after booting up and this last time it was around 30 min after booting up.


[12/03/2021 2:07 AM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
I've been on same os version and it's ran for 9 days and 5 days straight before needing to add extra fans and added extra video card another time


[12/03/2021 3:08 AM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
So I just reset again and lowered my OC settings (never had issues at current oc settings before after running days and with 5 less fans). About 4 min after upping my oc settings it went offline again this time at 45 min online mark.


[12/03/2021 3:10 AM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
Maybe I set the qfan settings in my bios wrong? I basically maxed them all out 100%


[12/03/2021 3:25 AM] Dv#3650
@Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand what os


[12/03/2021 3:32 AM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
Sorry. Hiveos


[12/03/2021 3:32 AM] Dv#3650
Turn logs on, it'll tell you why


[12/03/2021 3:32 AM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
Just unplugged new fans I hooked up and started up and didn't last 2 min and went offline but I didn't do anything in bios with turning off fan settings


[12/03/2021 3:33 AM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
Never turned on logs before. Are they self explanatory when you load them up?


[12/03/2021 3:35 AM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
Can I turn on logs via hiveos on phone when rig is turned off currently?


[12/03/2021 3:41 AM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
.


[12/03/2021 3:53 AM] Dv#3650
It's under send command yea you can turn them on from mobile


[12/03/2021 3:53 AM] Dv#3650
I'm at work currently so can't really walk you through, are you still in the hiveos discord?


[12/03/2021 5:31 AM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
I am..also currently I'm bed and will try to check it out in morning in 6 hrs


[12/03/2021 7:56 AM] andee#4722
anyone have any tips? gpu dropped out after 7-8 hours on lower voltage and core, tried upping voltage and core again but unable to get it kicking again

How did it go offline?


[12/03/2021 10:35 AM] Jack#3324
Noob question, these solo calculations are based on 100% effort per block right? So if you for example hit one block with 100%, second with 50% and third block 300% then you avg. effort is around 150% which is a lot worse then pools like flypool where avg. block around 100%. Then the next problem is ofc. rising difficulty. Overall pool>solo should be better, you can outperform pool only if you lucky.

Good question. I have no idea. It's done it 5 times or so. I guess DV said check the logs which I've never opened. So I'll try that here in a bit. Hopefully it works because I have issues at times as well with the miner not shutting down or rebooting when I command it to.


[12/03/2021 11:26 AM] Attila#3944
What does your hiveos client say?


[12/03/2021 11:28 AM] Attila#3944
Yes, theoretically they should be equal but diff makes it not be so to my understanding


[12/03/2021 12:51 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
Well, I fired it back up and been up and running just over an hour now with no issues. So I'm playing the waiting game to see if it goes offline.


[12/03/2021 12:59 PM] Attila#3944
Do you use the phone app?


[12/03/2021 1:00 PM] Attila#3944
If there‚Äôs an error I always get a notification


[12/03/2021 1:00 PM] Attila#3944
You can also set up Discord to notify you


[12/03/2021 1:00 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
I do get a Gmail email saying rig has gone offline. Doesn't specify why though in email


[12/03/2021 1:01 PM] Attila#3944
That‚Äôs from nanopool


[12/03/2021 1:01 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
Yeah


[12/03/2021 1:01 PM] Attila#3944
Do you have the hiveos app?


[12/03/2021 1:01 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
No. Just go to website from my mobile and log in


[12/03/2021 1:02 PM] Attila#3944
The notifications should be there too


[12/03/2021 1:02 PM] Attila#3944
But I suggest getting the app


[12/03/2021 1:02 PM] Attila#3944
It‚Äôs really handy


[12/03/2021 1:04 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
What differences are there between app and just going on website?


[12/03/2021 1:05 PM] Attila#3944
I personally find the app more ergonomic and convenient


[12/03/2021 1:05 PM] Attila#3944
Does the same


[12/03/2021 1:05 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511

[12/03/2021 1:06 PM] Attila#3944

[12/03/2021 1:06 PM] Attila#3944
Don‚Äôt you see like GPU are lost, restarting or something?


[12/03/2021 1:06 PM] Attila#3944
Or GPU drive error, no temps


[12/03/2021 1:06 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
Hour and a half in still running well. So I guess restarting it for a 4th time was what did the trick lol


[12/03/2021 1:07 PM] Attila#3944
I mean on the hiveos website


[12/03/2021 1:08 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
So I hooked up my fans initially. I got a 1 to 5 fan hub. Plugged 4 fans into that and 1 fan in a separate fan port. I then went to bios and changed qfan settings to 100%. I then booted up. I immediately got an error in yellow saying something about gpu Temps not set or something like that. I them powered down and back up and never saw that message again


[12/03/2021 1:09 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
Then it kept going offline randomly 1 min to 45 min between times. Now it's running so can't see what issue was now that it's running fine


[12/03/2021 1:10 PM] Attila#3944
I doubt it has anything to do with the fans


[12/03/2021 1:11 PM] Attila#3944

That's what I'm going with. Can I ask another question. I have issues with shutting down through hiveos. Like I can stop miner ok. But most of the time when I shutdown, restart, shutdown and reboot in 30 it just doesn't work. I need to then power down manually on rig with switch which I think may be bad.


[12/03/2021 1:23 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
As long as the miner is turned off and the cards have cooled off properly is it OK to power down via power switch on rig?


[12/03/2021 1:33 PM] Attila#3944
That‚Äôs weird, it should work. Powering down manually is also ok if the cards are cooled down


[12/03/2021 1:41 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
Yeah. I've had rig shut down in a matter of 15 seconds after I command it and ended up waiting 20 min after commanding it and it still runs other times. No worries if i can power down other way.


[12/03/2021 1:42 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
Thanks alot for the insight üòÄ


[12/03/2021 1:45 PM] Attila#3944
Sometimes it happens, still you should try switching it off via hiveos when possible


[12/03/2021 1:49 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
I'll try esch time and give it 10 min or so and if it doesn't then go with 2nd option

That isn't true if the miner is sending errors


[12/03/2021 7:46 PM] Dv#3650
I had to enable miner logs and check the log after it was rebooting a lot. Ended up one of the cards being too high oc


[12/03/2021 7:47 PM] Dv#3650
@Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand if you go to the hiveos discord and search for messages from me containing logs, you should be able to figure out how to enable and check them. If not if you ask in there someone should help you


[12/03/2021 7:49 PM] Attila#3944
Yeah, I meant rig-related errors


[12/03/2021 7:50 PM] Dv#3650
Yea if it were rig related the notifications would just be in hive, but clearly that isn't the case for them


[12/03/2021 8:29 PM] Swim#4211
Anyone ever get a "Critial process died" BSOD chain error from adding card to a system?


[12/03/2021 8:30 PM] Swim#4211
Seemed to detect them fine at first but I had to manually re turn off crossfire in AMD driver then it wont startup even on safe mode after cmos reset

Nope no luck from  sfc /scannow or chkdsk c:

Is it ok to fresh install with 3 cards off the bat?

[12/04/2021 5:06 PM] andee#4722
pools should just default to static, looks like a ton of new miners use this as a metric to compare pools


[12/04/2021 5:07 PM] Wolf9466#6211
no, they should NOT


[12/04/2021 5:07 PM] Wolf9466#6211
if a large farmer joins, his diff will start out fuck low, resulting in him flooding the pool with shares


[12/04/2021 5:08 PM] Wolf9466#6211
Conversely, a very slow miner might get disconnected for not sending anything before the server times out the connection cause the diff was too hard for them.


[12/04/2021 5:08 PM] andee#4722
large farms should know about this though.. looks like static works fine for nanopool


[12/04/2021 5:08 PM] Wolf9466#6211
Nano has LOADS of money to waste on servers.


[12/04/2021 5:09 PM] Wolf9466#6211
They don't need to worry about being temporarily overloaded.


[12/04/2021 5:09 PM] Wolf9466#6211
And their diff is rather high, for slow miners... again.


[12/04/2021 5:10 PM] andee#4722
they could have 4, 8 and vardiff. not just one or the other


[12/04/2021 5:10 PM] andee#4722
flypool defaults to 4 but offers custom diff through password field


[12/04/2021 5:10 PM] Wolf9466#6211
This I find reasonable.


[12/04/2021 5:11 PM] Wolf9466#6211
If a large farmer hits it, ban his ass for flooding; he deserves it for having more money than sense.


[12/05/2021 3:37 AM] ProSavage#7131
Yeah idk 4 Gh diff seems to work great for us but we‚Äôre a small pool


[12/05/2021 3:37 AM] ProSavage#7131

Hello I would like to know if it's possible to get mining reward on any address other than the node itself
Let's say that I have my `node 1` where I mine and I have an other node `node 2` when I want my mining reward
Can I link my node 1 with my node 2 into my ergo.conf file to get the mining rewards directly ? 
Thansk in advance


[12/06/2021 5:11 PM] greenpanther#2309
Wouldn't your mining reward be based on the address that you add in the conf. 

If you have the same address in both nodes, it should do. Right?


[12/06/2021 6:59 PM] case#9295
is there a link somebody could send me to to help me set up my pc for mining?

Does anyone know how I can tune nvidia gpu's in an ubuntu environment? I'd rather be on linux but stuck on windows because greenwithenvy only allows one gpu to be tuned and I can't tune the cards using the miner itself since that's only a windows feature.


[12/07/2021 6:01 AM] Wolf9466#6211
nvidia-smi


[12/07/2021 7:20 AM] Steel#8070
thank you, that's exactly what I was looking for! I was able to tune gpu 0 without a hitch, now to figure out why gpu1 doesn't want to apply my settings.


[12/07/2021 7:31 AM] andee#4722
if you dont have a screen connected you probably have to add a fake one


[12/07/2021 7:32 AM] Steel#8070
hmm, I guess i'll try that. I can change pl through terminal but that's about it. for gpu0 I can use terminal or nvidia-x-server settings.


[12/07/2021 7:32 AM] andee#4722
and 4-5 years ago you also had to add coolbits to unlock clocks

X server on NVIDIA card with no screen
I have a rather unique situation where I have a server with an NVIDIA graphics card installed that we need to have X server running on however the server lives on a rack with no monitor. The reason...

I had to reinstall my windows mining rig but now I get a "driver does not support" error when trying to run AMD memory tweak. Am I on the wrong version of AMD Adrenalin?


[12/07/2021 10:57 AM] andee#4722
don't you have to run developer mode or something like that to run tweak on windows?


[12/07/2021 10:57 AM] andee#4722
allowing unsigned drivers


[12/07/2021 11:12 AM] Swim#4211
I don't know any dev mode but I was running it just fine for months on end 2 cards no problem. My mistake was adding another card without resetting or uninstalling the GPU driver that crashed my hard drive


[12/07/2021 11:13 AM] Swim#4211
I managed to get AMD Tweak working by using an older version but now my system is unstable & I just don't get why


[12/07/2021 11:13 AM] Swim#4211
I'm guessing too new AMD driver & i need to revert to old. Windows is such a pain


[12/07/2021 11:14 AM] Swim#4211
Or maybe that I turned off all the extra options like smooth frames when disabling crossfire


[12/07/2021 11:14 AM] Swim#4211
I'm missing days of mining =/


[12/07/2021 11:14 AM] Swim#4211
Ohh you reminded me, "run as admin" il try this I guess before messing with versions


[12/07/2021 11:24 AM] Swim#4211
I think my OC is bad for 1 card perhaps. I have 2 vega 56 red dragons that were mining ergo then eth no problem. Last on Eth with around 1015 clock & memory. I tried to set this again plus on the 3rd card too, a sapphire
Now my windows crashes on every start up, presumably after setting these


[12/07/2021 11:24 AM] Swim#4211
Any clues what's wrong? I'm guessing Driver version should be same as in TRM


[12/07/2021 11:24 AM] Swim#4211
Set virtual memory no problem, added the reg files in TRM's folder for eth


[12/07/2021 11:38 AM] andee#4722
I guess you are using this computer since you insist on using windows? easiest route would be to flash hiveos on a flash drive


[12/07/2021 12:09 PM] geezar#8187
Agree as above using dedicated mining OS but DDU the drivers and start over - removing any OC or settings for the miner to autostart - windows can be reliable but a hassle... you'll never look back moving to one of the Linux distro's


[12/07/2021 12:31 PM] Swim#4211
Thanks for the support guys I appreciate it


[12/07/2021 12:32 PM] Swim#4211
The issue was incompatable versions of the drivers & an OC that worked before but seems to crash the primary.
Everything is working now, I just need to gently tweak the OC


[12/07/2021 12:33 PM] Swim#4211
Lucky I had the working AMD driver from my first install. They update so often & don't have drivers up from early this year


[12/07/2021 2:08 PM] Swim#4211
Um I have a new problem. When I install the driver I can no longer detect card 3, even if I system restore it's disabled again when installing gpu drivers


[12/07/2021 2:08 PM] Swim#4211
There's a little green light on the sapphire. spins and lights up just fine until windows is loaded


[12/07/2021 2:12 PM] Swim#4211
Turned off my machine & drained all power. This time it came on during windows np
But when I turned cross fire off the lights went out & cannot detect =/


[12/07/2021 2:14 PM] Swim#4211
This is the second version of amd adrenalin to do this


[12/07/2021 2:46 PM] andee#4722
swap power cables and see if the problem moves to a different gpu


[12/07/2021 5:41 PM] Swim#4211
It came back on, everything seemed to be working. Set virtual memory, miner seemed to work. Set overclock & got Clock_Timeout_Error then my HDD wont start up again


[12/07/2021 5:50 PM] andee#4722
its not booting at all?


[12/07/2021 7:07 PM] geezar#8187
Always take things back to the bare minimum if some components are not playing ball. If the mobo has onboard graphics just use that and remove the GPU‚Äôs and validate any bios changes you may have made . Diagnosis of rigs on windows are such a hassle


[12/08/2021 10:54 AM] greenpanther#2309
Is dev fee same as pool fee?


[12/08/2021 10:55 AM] apexpool#3878
no. different fees.


[12/08/2021 11:09 AM] greenpanther#2309
so where does dev fee go? To dev of the miner app?


[12/08/2021 11:11 AM] greenpanther#2309
Or the Coin devs


[12/08/2021 11:24 AM] apexpool#3878
dev of the miner app.

Hello. I went from 2 cards mining at max speeds to 3 cards with the primary at max but the other 2 are a bit slower. Any ideas what could be wrong? Had to wipe & reinstall machine so its a new w10 setup


[12/08/2021 10:50 PM] Swim#4211
Tried changing bios from auto to both gen 2 but no difference. I made sure to set virtual memory up & change amd tweak too


[12/08/2021 10:50 PM] Swim#4211
some old low power settings I used to use are no longer useable without a crash


[12/09/2021 5:15 AM] Runstyle#5968
@Swim 
what are those cards?
what speed were they mining at before and now?


[12/09/2021 9:53 AM] Swim#4211
3x vega 56 running atm. Originally it was just 2x red dragons on my rig that were in full 16x pcie slots. 
They were doing 150mh on Erg, changed to Eth (more  $) to mine n' sell it for erg. Was running both at 51-53MH no problems. 
I got a better power supply & decided to add on the Sapphire vega 56 I had running on another pc to my mining rig via a riser. Had to reinstall OS, Now the primary runs at 51-52 but the 2 others wont break 45-46 with similar settings. I just don't get it


[12/09/2021 9:54 AM] Swim#4211
The only thing I have not done that I may have before is download the "Mining.Bat" file people recommend but it seems sketchy, all sources go to a megaupload


[12/09/2021 9:56 AM] Swim#4211
The riser connection is molex but that shouldn't be a problem considering the sapphire is running at the same speed as the secondary pci slot red dragon


[12/09/2021 10:00 AM] Swim#4211
The last difference I can think of is using a newer WHQL Driver. All optional features on the cards via driver are switched off but no difference


[12/09/2021 10:03 AM] Swim#4211
Could it be a voltage thing? I'm using a Cooler Master Gold 850w PSU w 5 case fans but it's got pci slots for 4 cards +1 cpu


[12/09/2021 10:34 AM] andee#4722
if you are running them at max 850W is too small


[12/09/2021 10:34 AM] andee#4722
undervolted etc should be fine


[12/09/2021 10:37 AM] andee#4722
I dont know about vegas, but on RX xxx cards you have to enable compute mode, is it enabled on all of them?


[12/09/2021 10:38 AM] andee#4722
`--enable_compute` on trm, might have to run as admin


[12/09/2021 10:45 AM] Runstyle#5968
@Swim 
I don't have a specific solution for you but I can only suggest some testing and questions that may help isolate the problem.

Can you try mining on the gpus one by one and confirm the hashrate?
Try using pcie connector to power the risers
How much power are the cards using invidually?
Are the overclocks running the same for all during mining?

It could be that the .bat file had some extra parameters which were giving some boost in hashrate?


[12/09/2021 12:11 PM] Swim#4211
Thanks for the reply. I had a good look and there is no compute mode for these cards & I need the primary as a monitor


[12/09/2021 12:15 PM] Swim#4211
Thanks for the suggestions
1. I tried disabling them in a variety of combinations but no luck
2.I will try this next but using a spare PSU to power both the sapphire & the riser connected to my rig's board if this is ok 
3. The primary 140w the other 2 around 130w each. I have some problems on the sapphire if I undervolt the cpu too much
4. For the most part yes. I've had them running at the same for some time too which was a little unstable
5. I could try but it's really bad opsec & I'm not too comfy about it


[12/09/2021 12:15 PM] Swim#4211
I'll try the psu thing & get back to once Ive finished a few installs there


[12/09/2021 12:52 PM] andee#4722
Graphics work just fine in compute, but if you don‚Äôt need it that‚Äôs great. Do you have another computer? If so just try hiveos to eliminate OS as a problem


[12/09/2021 12:55 PM] Swim#4211
Thanks I will try as a command if not perhaps make a partition for hive


[12/09/2021 2:21 PM] Swim#4211
Ok tried it with another PSU, Wattage is not the problem same results.
I cannot test with PCI-e instead of molex as I need to run both Riser & card from the same psu but one psu Has 2x pcie 8 pin only (runs one card only no riser 6 pin) and the other has 3x double pcie 8 pin (runs 3 cards no riser) & 2 cpu 8 pin

hey lads quick question, if i mine eth on ethermine how would i convert my eth to ergo?


[12/09/2021 10:44 PM] Salu#0001
also theres a way to avoid gas fees right?


[12/09/2021 10:47 PM] Salu#0001
me think just swap on coinex


[12/09/2021 11:27 PM] Dv#3650
Payout in nano


[12/10/2021 12:11 AM] Salu#0001
how do i do that on ethermine?

At the moment gas fees are pretty good. I just did a swap of ETH to ERG through coinex. Gas fee was 39gwei so just aroun $3.5


[12/10/2021 10:54 AM] FlyingPig#2854
If gas prices are high then the 2miners nano payout is a good option. By buying you are also supporting the price. Mining is cool (i do that as well), but trading also supports the coin.


[12/10/2021 11:42 AM] Herk#6019
polygon is the way to go if you're on eth


[12/10/2021 12:35 PM] andee#4722
yes, we need more traders right now. nethash is decent


[12/10/2021 2:48 PM] Salu#0001
so i used polygon if im using ethermine?

you can use polygon if you mine eth on ethermine or flexpool

[12/10/2021 3:49 PM] Pharotek#2932

[12/10/2021 5:32 PM] geezar#8187
ETH the best play TBH if you do want to continue with ERG I've found 133 MH/s around 92w reported or in reality 145w - makes more sense to mine ETH and buy back into ERG


[12/10/2021 5:33 PM] geezar#8187
Pushing higher for efficiency play does not make sense but you should still hit around 155 MH/s but at more power


[12/10/2021 7:14 PM] Pharotek#2932
Yea I saw same mine are around 136@ 110-120.

today my miner went offline after 6 days running. powered down and back up and shutsdown after 1 min 30 sec. It has done this in the past and to remedy it i left it sit overnight and powered up in am and has ran 6 straight days no issues. For some reason my watchdog doesnt seem to reset it when it goes offline like i think it says to. i was told before to check mining log which i couldnt do at the time. For some reason a lot of the time when i send commands they just sit and think with the 3 bubbles and then just disappear. occasionally ill get lucky and one of them sticks and does the proper operation i want it to do. currently i cant get my miner log to stick to read it but the time i did see it it just looked like the t rex miner shut itself down. Any ideas on why its doing this?


[12/10/2021 10:34 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
I do want to mention i tried upping my OC a bit on a couple GPUs and then a couple min later is when it went offline. would going out of the threshhold cause the whole rig to go offline?


[12/10/2021 11:05 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
If you were adjusting OC while mining it could cause the GPU and in turn the rig to crash even if the setting is ok.  If it keeps crashing your settings are probably too high.


[12/10/2021 11:35 PM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
Good to know. What are near max OC settings for 3060 ti eagles?


[12/11/2021 12:28 AM] Dv#3650
Every card is different


[12/11/2021 12:34 AM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
I realize that but there has to be a min max threshold right? I just don't know how high I can really go. Or do I just increase each card some until rig crashes/goes offline then back off and repeat with next card?


[12/11/2021 12:37 AM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
I currently have a range between 6 cards at Cores between 1800-2000 and MEM between 2500-2700 PL all at 120W with temps ranging from 49-53 degrees fan speeds at 90-95


[12/11/2021 12:57 AM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Kind of a loaded question when ‚Äúover‚Äù clocking.   Technically youre going outside of the spec range per say.  When I adjust my cards I usually adjust in 100 intervals push to crash then back down 100 then up 50.  From there I usually adjust in intervals of 5-10 til crash again then back down 5.


[12/11/2021 1:01 AM] Kdawg5884 | Queens Right Hand#0511
so i was on the right track. i up mine by 100 each time. thanks for the input üôÇ


[12/11/2021 1:44 PM] Attila#3944
1; make a kucoin account or somewhere where you can trade btc for erg 2; get your btc deposit address there 3; start mining eth on 2miners and for wallet address simply add this btc address 4; every day at 12:00 UTC they‚Äôll pay you out in btc for a fee of a few cents 5; trade your btc for erg


[12/11/2021 1:45 PM] Attila#3944
Anything more is too complicated in my opinion - from polygon you‚Äôd still have to jump a few hoops to get erg


[12/11/2021 3:17 PM] Salu#0001
thanks!


[12/11/2021 3:20 PM] Attila#3944
Np. A lot of moving parts though - if price action is favorable, big gains over the trades. If not, not so much üôÇ


[12/11/2021 3:21 PM] Salu#0001
yeah thats the annoying part


[12/11/2021 3:21 PM] Salu#0001
i guess whats easiest for me to understand is just mine to an exchange wallet and swap lol..


[12/11/2021 3:25 PM] Attila#3944
Yeah, back to square one then - eth gas fees are often outrageous. Unless you have high enough hashrate it just eats up your gains. I find the above described method most convenient for my goals. Today my transfer fees were 0.03USD over 36 USD worth of ETH mined and I could buy 6.24 ERG out of what I made instead of 4.9ERG that I usually mine in 24 hours at a difficulty of 2


[12/11/2021 3:26 PM] Salu#0001
oh damn


[12/11/2021 3:27 PM] Salu#0001
so getting paid in btc you dont pay gas?


[12/11/2021 3:27 PM] Salu#0001
but dont they screw you on how much you are owed?


[12/11/2021 3:27 PM] Attila#3944
If eth price goes down and btc and erg/btc price goes up though, then it sucks. Cause you‚Äôre mining ETH, which gets swapped to BTC, which you use to buy ERG


[12/11/2021 3:27 PM] Salu#0001
also if price btc eth ratio changes?


[12/11/2021 3:27 PM] Salu#0001
how often are mining rewards updated


[12/11/2021 3:28 PM] Attila#3944
Never had the impression


[12/11/2021 3:29 PM] Attila#3944
BTC transfer fees are a lot lower. 2miners batches all mining rewards into 1 tx when they send it to an exchange, so there there‚Äôs only one gas fee payment that the pool just takes over. When withdrawing BTC from the exchange they also do it in one fell swoop and thus the tx fee is truly minimal


[12/11/2021 3:33 PM] Attila#3944
If you‚Äôre mining ERG and can get 156-157 on lower OC then it really doesn‚Äôt make a difference in theory if you overclock further cause you‚Äôll be limited by LHR and not memory clock speeds or power. The ‚Äúmost‚Äù you‚Äôre likely to get out of it is instability of the card and higher wattage, either of which can hardly be called a win


[12/11/2021 3:41 PM] Salu#0001
nice, ill defo look into this


[12/11/2021 3:41 PM] Salu#0001
@Aboodaka


[12/11/2021 3:42 PM] Attila#3944

In my opinion


[12/11/2021 3:46 PM] Salu#0001

[12/14/2021 4:33 PM] Terremot#4855
I've put a screenshot for maximum hash rate that I've managed on 3080Ti in the overclocking channel

with the core and memory clock settings

huh looks like trex doesnt support flypool yet


[12/14/2021 5:04 PM] andee#4722
how so? t-rex works just fine on flypool


[12/14/2021 5:04 PM] Babakinush#4237
which option do i choose?


[12/14/2021 5:04 PM] Babakinush#4237
i see Ergo-2miner, nanopool,woolypooly,herominers


[12/14/2021 5:05 PM] Babakinush#4237
Or does it not matter?


[12/14/2021 5:05 PM] andee#4722
I dont what options you are talking about, but t-rex mines at whatever pool you configure it to mine to


[12/14/2021 5:06 PM] Babakinush#4237

so weird, when i play a youtube video my hashrate goes back to 260

[12/14/2021 9:57 PM] Terremot#4855
Depends on the level of heat.  Higher is generally better, unless you're in a very cold room


[12/14/2021 9:57 PM] Babakinush#4237
if you run above 70% - do you run a risk of wearing out your fans?


[12/14/2021 10:32 PM] Babakinush#4237
whats the best way to do that?

Does ergo also need core or just mem?


[12/15/2021 7:18 AM] Dv#3650
both


[12/15/2021 7:19 AM] uros#2054
So whats a good starting point with the core for 3060ti?


[12/15/2021 7:19 AM] uros#2054
Lhr


[12/15/2021 7:43 AM] apexpool#3878
it depends if it has Samsung or Hynix memory.


[12/15/2021 7:44 AM] uros#2054
Samsung


[12/15/2021 7:44 AM] uros#2054
And hynix üòÑ


[12/15/2021 7:45 AM] apexpool#3878
for me, 92 for Samsung and 100 for Hynix.


[12/15/2021 7:45 AM] uros#2054
Ok and at what you got your core locked?


[12/15/2021 7:46 AM] apexpool#3878
1550, but it works pretty similar with a few other values.


[12/15/2021 7:46 AM] uros#2054
A ok,then 1450 is also ok üòä


[12/15/2021 7:46 AM] uros#2054
Are you getting any invalids?


[12/15/2021 7:47 AM] apexpool#3878
yes, 1450 should also be ok.
I don't get invalids, because I decreased memory clock until I did not have anymore invalids.


[12/15/2021 7:48 AM] uros#2054
I just got 2 in the past day


[12/15/2021 7:48 AM] apexpool#3878
2300 for Samsung, 2100 for Hynix


[12/15/2021 7:49 AM] apexpool#3878
it works with higher values (especially the Samsung), but I get invalids from time to time, and the difference in hashrate is not that big.


[12/15/2021 7:49 AM] uros#2054
Ok i will try with 2300 on samsung


[12/15/2021 7:49 AM] uros#2054
On the hynix i allready have 2000,cant go higher


[12/15/2021 7:50 AM] uros#2054
I will see with the core at 1450 if i get some,then also change the mem


[12/15/2021 7:51 AM] uros#2054
Does it make a difference with hynix if the tune is set to 100?i dont have it set and getting 132mh


[12/15/2021 8:29 AM] apexpool#3878
you will have to test, I guess. you should be able to get 135 MH/s at least, some people are reporting more.


[12/15/2021 8:30 AM] uros#2054
@apexpool tested it before and the hash was the same for me üòÑ


[12/15/2021 8:30 AM] apexpool#3878

[12/15/2021 8:30 AM] uros#2054
Yes


[12/15/2021 8:58 AM] andee#4722
for me setting lhr value made no difference, got 135 without it


[12/15/2021 9:03 AM] apexpool#3878
I guess you have to set it if you have different cards.


[12/15/2021 9:04 AM] Attila#3944
Either 0 or 100, the same with hynix in my experience


[12/15/2021 9:19 AM] andee#4722
nothing over 76 worked for me, same with eth. think it switches between 75-75.5


[12/15/2021 9:21 AM] apexpool#3878
on ETH for me: 73.9 Samsung, 74.4 Hynix.


[12/15/2021 9:21 AM] apexpool#3878

not very common here, if it has not been banned it will probably be soon


[12/15/2021 9:35 AM] andee#4722
paraffin burners were banned some years back


[12/15/2021 9:37 AM] andee#4722
and wood is cheaper, since I cut it myself. using gas is still ~‚Ç¨0.15 per kWh


[12/15/2021 9:38 AM] apexpool#3878
cheaper, but more inconvenient. my parents have heating with wood.


[12/15/2021 9:41 AM] andee#4722
if its really cold I have to do some refills, but today its probably enough to fire it up once


[12/15/2021 9:45 AM] andee#4722

Costs 3200 Euros in Austria. Doesn‚Äôt really make sense at this price. If you can get it under 3060ti price then it might, if the 45mh/s is right, but then you have no resale value once eth goes proof of stake

[12/18/2021 5:37 AM] Dv#3650
it's close but if you believe in ergo it's a no brainer, my 80tis are getting 44.5 MH/s Eth & 173.5 MH/s Ergo @ 245~ Watts


[12/18/2021 8:43 AM] geezar#8187
Tend to agree for daily profit but not all miners will be cashing out each day, ETH does make more sense currently 
3080ti around 230w average 270 MH/s on ERG will yield around $4.13 or 90 MH/s pure ETH at 270w $6.01
Dual mining with that 245w will $2.94 with 44.5 MH/s and $1.54 with 173.5 MH/s $4.48 - so $1.53 down over the same period. 
Too many variables and its up to the individual, potential market conditions and risk appetite but ETH remains the smart play purely for profit 'today' IMO - the extra power consumption aside and confidence in ERG future all up to the individual - same for Vegas 50-56 MH/s ETH makes a lot more sense that 130-150 MH/s on ERG

I‚Äôve been mining eth for btc on 2miners for a couple weeks now. I usually get 0.008 eth a day that goes to btc which I immediately trade for ERG. Today was my best mining luck day ever, already at 0.014 eth and there‚Äôs still an hour until cashout for today. Gains will be made today üôÇ

[12/18/2021 2:19 PM] geezar#8187
Nice, at current prices the ETH will generate $31.51 USD and in turn allow you to buy 5.5 or perhaps 6 ERG per day give or take luck / other variables. Wonder back to back with your hash what you‚Äôr mined ERG would have been as a comparison (suspect ETH play is allowing your to bag more) buys will help volume and in turn help the project so makes a lot of sense


[12/18/2021 5:43 PM] Attila#3944

As soon as ERG starts climbing and BTC closes back on ETH it can easily happen that straight up mining erg gets a lot better in output. Been there once where an unfortunate price action ate away at 20% of my daily gains

I think one of my vega 56 maybe done for üò∞ Does not boot alone in primary slot (black screen) & gives VGA mobo error light solid but fans spin up & it lights up no problem. Same with both dual bios
Putting it in 2nd slot or a riser it will actually boot up, load windows & recognize it in device manager but causes crashes installing amd adrenalin or loading windows after, sometimes random crash.
Any advice? tried opening it up but nothing looked wrong so just replaced thermal paste. It's very expensive for me since I only had 3 cards starting up & still owe on them

Yes I did burn a cable on amd adrenalin but had a spare psu to use


[12/19/2021 2:21 PM] Swim#4211
too high wattage mining ergo but learned the lesson


[12/19/2021 2:22 PM] Swim#4211
The cards were all fine, just that cable burned. This time I woke up to a black screen, hit reset and had boot / crash issues with one of the cards that used to be the primary


[12/19/2021 2:23 PM] Swim#4211
this time mining Eth with 1050 core 850 core voltage and 960 mem clock. Sort of odd since its undervolted


[12/19/2021 2:24 PM] apexpool#3878
how much power does it use with those settings? and what hashrate do you get?


[12/19/2021 2:25 PM] apexpool#3878
you can set core voltage to 775 for those clocks and save some Watts.


[12/19/2021 2:26 PM] apexpool#3878
and even increase mem clock to 975, if it does not crash üòâ


[12/19/2021 2:29 PM] Swim#4211
about 106w normally for 49/50 MH/S except the primary drew about 124w
I figured since it was displaying the system too


[12/19/2021 2:29 PM] Swim#4211
I set the 2 survivors to 980. Seems stable & nice too bad about the other. So hard to snowball early


[12/19/2021 2:30 PM] Swim#4211
I guess finding a repair guy & writing down the serial codes is prob my only option


[12/19/2021 2:30 PM] apexpool#3878
Samsung memory, I assume.


[12/19/2021 2:30 PM] Swim#4211
Yes


[12/19/2021 2:31 PM] apexpool#3878
I was getting 52.27 MH/s with the settings above (1050 core clock 975 mem clock 775 core voltage) for 101w reported power usage with my Sapphire Pulse Radeon Vega 56


[12/19/2021 2:32 PM] apexpool#3878
now I am using even lower power settings.

[12/19/2021 2:34 PM] Swim#4211
Pretty good. I need to trick my power slider to -50 then back to 0 in amd adrenaline to get it to reduce the voltage


[12/19/2021 2:35 PM] apexpool#3878
my Sapphire Pulse card does not want lower than 768 core voltage üôÇ


[12/19/2021 2:35 PM] apexpool#3878
the others can go to 756.


[12/19/2021 2:37 PM] Swim#4211
I actually have a pulse so il try it


[12/19/2021 2:38 PM] apexpool#3878
I like it a lot more than the other 2, it takes a lot more overclocking


[12/19/2021 2:39 PM] apexpool#3878
the second one is strange, always using more power (although identical to the first one) and takes less overclocking than the first one.


[12/19/2021 2:39 PM] apexpool#3878
it will be the first sold üòÇ  when the time comes.


[12/19/2021 2:39 PM] apexpool#3878
even if it is almost new


[12/19/2021 2:41 PM] Swim#4211
Strange as it sounds I think the screen power off thing may have caused me some pain. Before this it would mine all day fine but in the morning after not checking it in a while I'd sometimes get a black screen or a rare crash using it normally


[12/19/2021 2:41 PM] Swim#4211
maybe it was on its way out


[12/19/2021 2:42 PM] Swim#4211
Also when are you selling? I'm guessing eth 2.0?


[12/19/2021 3:07 PM] apexpool#3878
I'm selling my Vega 56 cards when I find other Nvidia Cards at good prices to replace them. preferably 3060ti with Samsung memory.


[12/19/2021 3:07 PM] andee#4722
have you tried swapping cables to confirm that it has not happened again?


[12/19/2021 3:08 PM] Swim#4211
Yes Sir, tried with multiple cables only that card


[12/19/2021 3:09 PM] Swim#4211
tried with other psu on a rise still issues


[12/19/2021 3:15 PM] andee#4722
not much to do then. maybe check gpu power connector and check if bios checksum is correct


[12/19/2021 3:16 PM] andee#4722
try running hiveos or something like that to confirm its not something driver related


[12/19/2021 3:19 PM] Herk#6019
if lucky it could be a simple fix, just hard to find the right person to do it


[12/19/2021 4:34 PM] geezar#8187
If you don't find some one local there is a guy I can recommend over on Panda's discord that offers his services fixing GPU's - based in the US but ships (can get expensive quickly.. so local for you would be better)


[12/19/2021 4:36 PM] geezar#8187
Good power - the Hynix usually hold in the 731mv range max 750mv if your looking to carve off some more power


[12/19/2021 4:46 PM] Herk#6019
tech cemetery's discord has a bunch of recommendations that cover pretty much all parts of the world, however northridgefix would be my 1st choice if in the US


[12/19/2021 6:56 PM] Swim#4211
Thanks for the reply guys. I'm in Scotland so I was just thinking to call up a few places in the city & ask around if they do board repair & the prices.


[12/19/2021 6:57 PM] Swim#4211
I'll maybe play with it some more first, worth a try but was playing with it all day yday & no dice on different cables & psu that work for other cards


[12/19/2021 7:33 PM] geezar#8187
If you can see the GPU in a DOS session always a good fail safe - I've used BIOS flash tools on the PCB too with some success - just boot a USB key using rufus an freedos and run the tool - if you can see the GPU there could be some hope, if its another component would need the traces/components checked over - worth a look if you've not tried it before **amdvbflash_dos_4.68.zip** https://www.techpowerup.com/download/ati-atiflash/

Please point me somewhere that shows LHR effects Autolykos as I legitimately never seen other algorithms effected besides ethash


[12/24/2021 7:34 PM] apexpool#3878
they do not care so much about other algorithms to mention them, because ethash is much more mined.

[12/25/2021 1:11 PM] Attila#3944
I‚Äôll come again here. Mining on HiveOS but their discord seems pretty dead. I have two issues popping up. One is that one of the cards just disappears from the rig, only the red square remains as if I had removed it on the fly. A reboot solves it, but it is concerning as it‚Äôs been repeating each 24 hours or so. I suspected a bad riser and changed it to a new one but it still happens.


[12/25/2021 1:14 PM] Attila#3944
The second issue is one of my two rigs going offline and not rebooting even though I have the watchdog set up. This happened after 16 days uptime but of fucking course today when I‚Äôm still supposed to be out of country for close to 2 weeks. I‚Äôm traveling back to the country tomorrow just to reboot the rig and catch an afternoon train to catch the evening‚Äôs festivities. It is what it is but I‚Äôd love to have the system to force reboot when any significant parameter is knocked out.


[12/25/2021 1:20 PM] Attila#3944
Has anyone an idea as to how I can force a rig reboot if the system gets knocked off in any capacity?

[12/25/2021 2:03 PM] Herk#6019
make sure you change the riser and the mobo adapter and cable and that it‚Äôs plugged correctly, shouldn‚Äôt be any other reason but you could check ‚Äúdmesg‚Äù if you are able to ssh into the box


[12/25/2021 2:04 PM] Herk#6019
this sounds like a kernel panic or some bug in the driver which could prevent it from rebooting, but can‚Äôt tell w/o more info - however you could work around it with a ‚Äúsmart plug‚Äù and reboot it remotely


[12/25/2021 2:22 PM] andee#4722
depends on what the problem is. if the system freezes you need an external watchdog


[12/25/2021 2:22 PM] andee#4722
other stuff can be fixed with cron and a bash script


[12/25/2021 3:49 PM] Attila#3944

[12/25/2021 3:50 PM] Attila#3944

Is anyone familiar with these breakout boards? If so how accurate is this reading? From my calculations, this should be 868.69 watts. (Hive is reporting 916~ watts) If the 868.69 is accurate to the the board, and my PSUs are 93% platinum how would I calculate what the power draw from the wall is? Psus are rated for 1200 watts @ 220v

[01/04/2022 9:42 AM] andee#4722
868.69/0.93


[01/04/2022 9:43 AM] Dv#3650
Thank you, but is the reading accurate? Or do you know?


[01/04/2022 9:52 AM] Andrius 11G#2333
every psu loose some W


[01/04/2022 9:52 AM] Andrius 11G#2333
so you are loosing 7%


[01/04/2022 9:52 AM] Andrius 11G#2333
but it still depends on the load


[01/04/2022 9:54 AM] Andrius 11G#2333

[01/04/2022 9:54 AM] Andrius 11G#2333
this is as example of 1000 P5 model.


[01/04/2022 9:56 AM] Andrius 11G#2333
and 93% is the max efficency on 50% load


[01/04/2022 9:57 AM] Andrius 11G#2333
so on 100% you should be wasting more eletricity


[01/04/2022 9:57 AM] Dv#3650
Yes I know, you lose w because it's ac to dc


[01/04/2022 9:57 AM] Dv#3650
What are those 3 lines representing? Is it the same PSU?


[01/04/2022 9:57 AM] Andrius 11G#2333
top right explanation


[01/04/2022 9:58 AM] Dv#3650
Yea still confused


[01/04/2022 9:58 AM] Dv#3650
Is it the same PSU with different input voltages?


[01/04/2022 9:59 AM] Andrius 11G#2333
top 2 is how much they take from diff input


[01/04/2022 9:59 AM] Dv#3650
If not then it seems like apples to oranges


[01/04/2022 9:59 AM] Andrius 11G#2333
red how much is given to psu


[01/04/2022 9:59 AM] Dv#3650
Oooh okay


[01/04/2022 9:59 AM] Dv#3650
So red is output


[01/04/2022 10:03 AM] Andrius 11G#2333
yep


[01/04/2022 10:03 AM] Andrius 11G#2333
every psu have diff characteristics


[01/04/2022 10:04 AM] Andrius 11G#2333
so you need to find you psu chart


[01/04/2022 10:04 AM] Andrius 11G#2333
but more or less should be simillar

[01/04/2022 10:12 AM] Dv#3650
They're only at about 80% load


[01/04/2022 10:15 AM] Andrius 11G#2333
ok..so should be 93%


[01/04/2022 10:15 AM] Andrius 11G#2333
on full load eff is 92%


[01/04/2022 10:21 AM] Dv#3650
So then assuming the reading on the breakout board is accurate for output power, input power from the wall should be 944.22 - 934.07. 92% & 93%


[01/04/2022 10:21 AM] Dv#3650
Hmm they're actually closer to 73.4% load


[01/04/2022 11:06 AM] Andrius 11G#2333
well...its better to have power meter if you want to be 100% sure


[01/04/2022 11:07 AM] Andrius 11G#2333
and its never the same...it's always goes up and down...my electricity +-5% goes up or down on the day


[01/04/2022 9:32 PM] miner29#2975
note you need to be on 230-240v to get the ratings from the report...if you are on 110-120v its not going to be as efficient.


[01/05/2022 1:13 AM] Dv#3650

anyone able to send me a bio's flash for PowerColor Red Dragon Vega 56?  Got a new card and the flash that is on it is very screwy, any help would be great


[02/04/2022 9:28 PM] liquid_phase#4605
which country taxes mining?


[02/04/2022 9:28 PM] Dv#3650
Many


[02/04/2022 9:33 PM] liquid_phase#4605
i thought they did not tax mining, but selling of crypto of the difference between what you bought/mined it for versus what you sold it for, ex: capital gains tax


[02/04/2022 10:01 PM] Dv#3650
They do both


[02/04/2022 10:50 PM] liquid_phase#4605
how would they associate the miners address to the person since there is no KYC


[02/05/2022 2:01 AM] Dv#3650
they don't have too


[02/05/2022 2:01 AM] Dv#3650
it's tax evasion, aka fck around and find out


[02/08/2022 10:38 PM] Qu11n#6461
problem is when you dont tax your mining in my country is that in 4-5  years when ergo booms and i sell some they're gonna come and ask me where i got all the money from üôÇ so personally im skipping tax evasion and i plan to tax all my gains

They don‚Äôt care about the address, only what you convert to fiat is generally considered taxable


[02/09/2022 11:15 AM] Attila#3944
So that‚Äôs where they look

Hi ! I have an issue with one of my rigs, can someone help please. My rigs run for few mins then reboots itself without any error. Changed cables ram psu everything but still having the same problem. Please help


[02/11/2022 11:58 AM] Wic#2498
Im mining ergo on nano pol, but reward is cant payout


[02/11/2022 3:39 PM] Qu11n#6461
Do you have any more information? Are you running windows? Hiveos? What cards? What overclocks? Are the cards you are running getting enough power?


[02/11/2022 3:45 PM] Nikhil khurana#9439
Hey man thanks for the reply. I got it sorted. There was an issue with one of my cards.


[02/11/2022 3:53 PM] Qu11n#6461
gucci! happy mining!


[02/14/2022 3:14 PM] Swim#4211
I have a cooler master v850 gold v2. Is it dangerous to run a 3rd vega 56 off it? 
If I do, I cannot use a pcie cable to power it only molex to power the riser


[02/15/2022 3:12 AM] Dv#3650
I'd personally never run risers off of anything besides pcie. But that's just me. I'd really rather not risk the fire


[02/22/2022 5:59 PM] Swim#4211
I'll probably take your advice next time around. Unfortunately this psu only have 3x pcie id need 4x for both the 3rd card and riser so I'll just daisy chain another psu instead so the card on the riser is the same psu as what runs the riser


[02/22/2022 5:59 PM] Swim#4211
is this ok on the same system?


[02/23/2022 1:30 AM] fqv#2223
Hey everyone. Is it a problem if my T-Rex miner restarts in HiveOS every 12 hours (approximately) due to the Nonce error (associated to over clocking)? The rest of the time it works pretty well and I get 100% of shares.


[02/23/2022 1:34 AM] Gainzez#4967
Its not really a huge "issue" IMO as your system is setup to restart, just means your likely pushing it about 1-2% beyond what it should. In theory your MINER setup should NEVER restart, given good voltage and proper OC settings

As you can see above, mine has been 31+ hours non-stop, no issues, its clocked at this as I was swapping out some riser, and it is happy as clam. Running it off of WIN 10

Tinker my friend! And keep a journal! of what WORKS!


[02/23/2022 1:37 AM] fqv#2223
Yeah I‚Äôm doing that!!! I got a notebook beside my rig haha


[02/24/2022 8:46 PM] fqv#2223
Just wanted to say that I decreased the MEM offset in Hive OS from 3300 to 3290 (literally only a 10 difference) and now it‚Äôs *solid as a rock*, with literal null effect on MH/s. The rig has been up for 30 hours with no problem at all


[02/27/2022 8:59 AM] Ananas#9063
just to clarify, did you decrease the mem overclock from 3300 to 3290 mhz?


[02/28/2022 8:38 AM] WINNI#3324
Hey guys, does someone has expierence with DPS 1200 SB-A? I only used DPS 1200 FB-A so far (Both are HP 1200W Server PSU)

How come vega 56 are so much cheaper now? Is it a bad buy

All cards are dropping. But the Vegas got nerfed on ergo


[03/02/2022 9:08 AM] Big Mac | Small Minerüòé#0538
You can get 200mhs on ergo?


[03/02/2022 9:08 AM] Big Mac | Small Minerüòé#0538
On a 56


[03/02/2022 3:14 PM] Swim#4211
I think this isnt limited to vega 56 but anything 8gb or less If I'm correct which is unfortunate but still good for Eth


[03/02/2022 6:30 PM] Dv#3650
Don't think so. My 3gb cards never lost hash


[03/02/2022 6:30 PM] Dv#3650
@Swim


[03/02/2022 6:31 PM] Swim#4211
oh then its not a DAG file size thing


[03/02/2022 6:33 PM] Dv#3650
It is a Dag file size thing


[03/02/2022 6:33 PM] Dv#3650
But it only effected the Vega cards


[03/02/2022 6:34 PM] Swim#4211
Did it effect 5700 / xt / 6800 / 6900s?


[03/02/2022 6:34 PM] Swim#4211
genuinely curious, I got 3x vega 56 but managed to fry one so im down to 2. id like to get more


[03/02/2022 6:35 PM] Swim#4211
I went 200 > 150 with mine


[03/02/2022 6:57 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
It didnt seem to impact any of these.   Basically the optimization's in TRM that brought the vegas to 200 was lost


[03/02/2022 6:58 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
And was only for ergo afaik.   Other mineable coins were not impacted

hi, possobly the wrong channel, i have 3 3060ti LHR, 2 on hive, 1 on windows, the hive ones are getting 120MH/s, the windows one only 44MH/s, has anyone had this before.  sureuly this isnt right.  ive tried NBMiner, TREX and LOL all with similar results.  im lost now


[03/23/2022 2:26 AM] frajeris70#9848
Hi, so i came across blog post on ergoplatform, about mining on windows. sure enough, it looks just complicated as i am willing to continue with it, actually setting it up. 
But, yeah it does not work. 
GPU is GTX 1070 ti. ive downloaded T-Rex soft. saved edited file ERGO_mining.bat in startup folder. but nothing is happening when i check HWMonitor or TaskManager. Anyone here willing to help out? Thanks!


[03/23/2022 4:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
uh did you edit the bat file


[03/23/2022 4:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
bro i dont know what they got goin on there, but its as simple as this.  get trex, unzip to folder, edit the bat file with your wallet address and pool info.  open the bat and you are good to go.


[03/23/2022 2:36 PM] Pharotek#2932
They did get needed, but, I get 128-138mh @ 130w per card. And right now they are same price in us as rx580 8g card. Vegas are still a 100% win for hasrate to cost to me.


[03/23/2022 2:40 PM] Pharotek#2932
I love my Vegas, ive found msi boost and powercolor red devils are beasts.

[03/23/2022 9:10 PM] Terremot#4855
you can do a bit better üòâ


[03/23/2022 9:10 PM] Qu11n#6461

mine is 1011


[03/23/2022 9:11 PM] Terremot#4855
2.4KW overall


[03/23/2022 9:11 PM] Qu11n#6461
i did 174 on them earlier, but the rig started crashing with downtimes that i had to hardreboot them


[03/23/2022 9:11 PM] Qu11n#6461
so i tuned down abit and now its been running for 17 days


[03/23/2022 9:11 PM] Terremot#4855
each card has slightly different mem clock settings

lol


[03/23/2022 9:12 PM] Terremot#4855
my determination to get max hashrate won't let me keep them all the same


[03/23/2022 9:12 PM] Qu11n#6461
you running -500 CC or 1600?


[03/23/2022 9:13 PM] Terremot#4855
depends on card


[03/23/2022 9:13 PM] Terremot#4855
1750 to 1850


[03/23/2022 9:13 PM] Terremot#4855
to make sure it has enough power


[03/23/2022 9:13 PM] Terremot#4855
the 3080Tis all have 1800CC


[03/23/2022 9:14 PM] Terremot#4855
and different mem clocks


[03/23/2022 9:14 PM] Qu11n#6461
i run mine at 1600 cc and 130w max


[03/23/2022 9:14 PM] Qu11n#6461
some drop down to 120w


[03/23/2022 9:14 PM] Terremot#4855
I don't pay power, so I can afford to go for max hashrate


[03/23/2022 9:15 PM] Qu11n#6461
i pay for power now, i went for 172-173 earlier when i didnt


[03/23/2022 9:15 PM] Terremot#4855
fair enough


[03/23/2022 9:16 PM] Qu11n#6461
but i also run 1070's and 1080ti's x)


[03/23/2022 9:16 PM] Terremot#4855
but power efficiency is really good on ergo


[03/23/2022 9:16 PM] Qu11n#6461
ye they are

I can see the temptation on flux tbf

ye thats fair, im 50-55% ROI'd

[03/23/2022 9:22 PM] Terremot#4855
yeah, I'm only going to sell half at max from now on


[03/23/2022 9:22 PM] Qu11n#6461

[03/23/2022 9:26 PM] Terremot#4855

[03/23/2022 9:34 PM] Qu11n#6461
i use the VPN when im at work cuz they blocked everything


[03/23/2022 9:34 PM] Qu11n#6461
like youtube, netflix, crypto stuff


[03/23/2022 9:35 PM] Terremot#4855
my work definitely didn't block youtube


[03/23/2022 9:35 PM] Qu11n#6461
and i get past that by sitting in sweden instead of norway x)


[03/23/2022 9:35 PM] Terremot#4855
but I am IT support, so I can always say I need youtube for my work


[03/23/2022 9:35 PM] Qu11n#6461
Well its blocked at rigs due to lack of coverage


[03/23/2022 9:36 PM] Qu11n#6461

Ouch, even on ebay the cost of card vs Hashrate is nuts for that card.... 1500-1800 for that card.... 280/130=2.1 Vegas. vegas are 400-450. 900-1000$ for 2 vegas for same hash rate nope not me.


[03/24/2022 3:15 AM] Dv#3650
Vegas not as power efficient though, no?


[03/24/2022 3:15 AM] Dv#3650
I found out really quite how efficiency can fuck you in a bear market


[03/24/2022 6:40 AM] Terremot#4855
I dropped my Vegas when they could no longer do 200mhs


[03/24/2022 10:00 PM] Salu#0001
Guys, I just plugged in my atx psu and there's a faint buzzing noise coming from both of them from the same outlet


[03/24/2022 10:00 PM] Salu#0001
Is that bad?


[03/24/2022 10:01 PM] Salu#0001
I kinda don't want to use this outlet since its a little scary


[03/24/2022 10:01 PM] Salu#0001
When I hook my power meter into the outlet and run my psu off that the noise is gone


[03/24/2022 10:02 PM] Salu#0001
Is the (feed back I think it's called) noise being filtered by the meter?


[03/24/2022 10:02 PM] Salu#0001
Never mind the noise is still there when I use my meter


[03/24/2022 10:38 PM] Terremot#4855
I can have more cards on one rig.  Vegas have lost their appeal as they're old and can no longer do 200Mhs.  I paid no more than 1250 for each of my cards, so they're value for money


[03/25/2022 12:23 AM] Pharotek#2932
Power is cheap for me, but that is draw back. Run around 125watt


[03/25/2022 12:25 AM] Pharotek#2932
That us correct, imo, 1700 for 1 card to do 200mh vs 1 card to do 130mh for 400-480$....


[03/25/2022 3:31 AM] SoCool#6419

[03/25/2022 1:09 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289

One thing you can try is use and industrial extension cord (rated at 15amps) and plug one PSU into a different outlet on a different line. Will rule out the overloading theory

Anybody mining in Linux with Nvidia can say how to knock power max down?


[03/28/2022 12:46 PM] SoCool#6419
I have an Nvidia x configuration thing which exposes core and mem clock when I fiddled a bitmask in the x config, but I don't see anywhere to change voltage


[03/28/2022 1:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
@SoCool is it a mobile card?

[03/28/2022 2:36 PM] Herk#6019
you want to set the power limit in linux?


[03/28/2022 2:37 PM] SoCool#6419
I read about miners tuning down the power usage of their GPUs, I don't see how or where to touch a power curve in Nvidia settings though in Linux


[03/28/2022 2:38 PM] Herk#6019
dunno if that's possible, if you just want to change the power limit you can use "nvidia-smi", something like this would do if you have just 1 card installed:

nvidia-smi -pl 140


[03/28/2022 2:38 PM] Herk#6019
that would set the power limit to 140W, or if have more cards, you can specify the card with "-i"


[03/28/2022 2:40 PM] SoCool#6419
Woot, thanks! I'll give such a try.. Yeah I just have a gaming computer with an rtx 3070, I don't game a ton so I play minig with it üôÇ


[03/28/2022 2:42 PM] SoCool#6419
While I'm asking - can afterburner easily change voltage too in windows? I boot back and forth depending whether I'm coding on things or not.


[03/28/2022 2:51 PM] SoCool#6419
...Dude! You rock! power just popped down from 160 constant to 130 per nbminer, and hashrate didn't change, thanks a bundle!! I been wondering how I can do that forever..


[03/28/2022 2:52 PM] SoCool#6419
(or for a couple months, and vaguely caring because I'm too lazy to read docs)


[03/28/2022 2:53 PM] SoCool#6419
With lower power limit can I get a higher LHR number now? Hmm.. I think I need to play with it which will likely waste the rest of my day now hah


[03/28/2022 3:04 PM] Herk#6019
well, not sure about that, depends on the card and settings you use, sure needs some tweaking to get it right


[03/28/2022 3:05 PM] Herk#6019
pretty sure the miner can help too, you'd need to go through the docs and see if nbminer allows you to set the core/memory clocks


[03/28/2022 3:05 PM] Herk#6019
and start off with some settings from maybe https://www.hashrate.no/


[03/28/2022 3:07 PM] Herk#6019
otherwise you can try nvidia-smi, "-lgc" is for core clocks and "-lmc" is for mem clock, so something like

nvidia-smi -lgc 1500
nvidia-smi -lmc 8000

should do, haven't done this manually in a while though


[03/28/2022 3:07 PM] SoCool#6419
Awesome, yeah - with nbminer I *think* it can do some overclock stuff if you use its driver support things but I've been hesitant to fiddle with that.

Nvidia settings UI however lets me bump so I'm at -450 and +2500 in there (gets to same memory clock as +1200 in afterburner, not sure why the numbers shift in linux)

With nbminer I have it set starting at 90 and bouncing down .1 every time it gets LHR locked at most 70 times until it gets to 83 (which I know to be absolutely constant)


[03/28/2022 3:07 PM] Herk#6019
oh great then


[03/28/2022 3:08 PM] SoCool#6419
The nvidia settings UI is working alright - just didn't have any voltage stuff


[03/28/2022 3:08 PM] SoCool#6419
or wattage or whatever


[03/28/2022 3:09 PM] Herk#6019
that makes sense, however with the nvidia-smi -lgc command about you'd be able to lock the core clock


[03/28/2022 3:09 PM] Herk#6019
which means you don't need to set a power limit


[03/28/2022 3:10 PM] SoCool#6419
Cool, that's great to know - plus I can pop that into place with a simple shell script and run this in `init 3` then which may have zero impact but lets me play with it heh


[03/28/2022 3:10 PM] Herk#6019
should be better, you'd have to test both ofc


[03/28/2022 3:14 PM] SoCool#6419
Oh and nvidia-smi can do fan power too; I lock it to 70% in UI, will set that with smi too in script..


[03/28/2022 3:22 PM] SoCool#6419
it may not; c'est la vie


[03/28/2022 3:28 PM] Herk#6019
nvidia-settings can but you'd need X running for that


[03/28/2022 3:42 PM] SoCool#6419
Aye, well I'll take it. It's all just a simple little shell script now with nvidia-settings setting fan speed and smi locking memory and core down and power limit of 122 - nbminer gives me the 144mh/s I was getting before and reports ~118w vs the constant 160 I had. Thanks a ton for your help!

I feel like a dummy for running at 160w for months only to decide to finally fiddle with power the other day and get my power down to constant 107w with my rate going from 144mh/s to 142mh/s.

It's been going non-stop stable as a rock at low-ass temp of 39 now for a couple days like this. Fiddling with power limit should have been step 1.. 3080 ti showing up tomorrow, and glad I know now how to meddle with power limit..

[04/01/2022 3:57 PM] vexorg#0768
when trying to mine ergo with an rx470 4gb, I get tons of errors about rejected shares due to low difficulty, any suggestions on how to fix this?


[04/01/2022 10:01 PM] SoCool#6419
@Cheese Enthusiast I was curious if you could shine a light on which to believe about hash rate: NBMiner/whatever miner, or what the pool says? I used to mine to 2miners then moved to GetBlok, both of them report numbers well higher than what nbminer tells me.

I know others have seen this before, I tend to assume that nbminer is more accurate but I don't know, so which one should miners believe to be more correct - in terms of expected earnings calculator (so for a longer period is maybe the distinction between the two?)


[04/02/2022 1:02 AM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
In general, mining software gives you a more accurate view of what your hardware is actually doing. 

Pools calculate hashrate by extrapolating the number from the shares you submit, they have no idea exactly how many hashes your machine is doing because that would be too much data to send over a stratum connection.

In general, your pool hashrate is more relevant for your payouts as its calculated from shares, while your software hashrate is more accurate to the number of hashes being performed.


[04/02/2022 1:04 AM] SoCool#6419
Thanks! So using the GetBlok hashrate in the calculator for payouts is more rational for that vs my miner - but for tuning and OC rely on my miner of course


[04/02/2022 1:04 AM] SoCool#6419
Much appreciated for the clarity!

run it without overclocks and see if you get the error.  if you still get error its the pool.  if no error, its your settings.

hi, if i dual mine ergo and zil, would my rig be mining both at the same time or does it stop mining ergo when zil start?


[04/02/2022 8:22 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
stop and start, haven't done ergo but thats how it is for eth it doesn't mine them at the same time.


[04/03/2022 12:17 AM] Dv#3650
That's false


[04/03/2022 12:17 AM] Dv#3650
A certain % of the gpu mines one coin while the remaining % mines the other.


[04/03/2022 12:29 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
Zil is mined for 1 minute every 2-3 hours.. while you earn coins at the same time, they aren't  mined at the same time (not by splitting gpu %). Unless something recently changed it switches.


[04/03/2022 12:30 AM] Dv#3650
That's doesn't sound accurate to dual mining then.


[04/03/2022 12:30 AM] Dv#3650

Zilliqa Dual Mining vs Ethereum Regular Mining. 2Miners Pool...
The 2Miners pool lists 19 cryptocurrencies with 10 thousand online members. There is Ethereum with at least 4 thousand miners, Ravencoin, Bitcoin Gold, Zcoin, Ethereum Classic, and other popular cryptocurrencies. However, the pool often gets requests about adding Zilliqa that supports dual...

I think it works differently with LHR cards because part of the gpu isn't being utilized so if you mine eth and alephium it is both at once (% dedicated to each algo). Could be wrong but that's what I recall. Could depend on the mining software used as well.


[04/03/2022 12:45 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
yeah because with Zil, it's not really dual mining since it switches, they just call it that.


[04/03/2022 12:51 AM] Rasgem√ºt#8093
Hello, I would like to switch to Ergo after ETH, as this currency offers many advantages and is more ecological for the cards.

 I'm now just considering it would make more sense.  Switch to Ergo straight away or wait and see how the market develops after ETH.

 Ravencoin makes no sense, too much power.  So it fits in very well.  I compared many cards with benchmarks at Ravencoin and Ergo, and Ergo was always better.


[04/03/2022 12:55 AM] Dv#3650
You could switch to dual mining eth and ergo in the mean time


[04/03/2022 6:40 AM] blackinsecure#3693
maybe split your cards for like a week or so just to test it out


[04/03/2022 1:08 PM] .Lily#8358
with 2 psu's does it matter if im plugging in the risers with the same or with different psu?
current setup would be 1 psu has all risers + motherboard stuff
other psu has all the gpus


[04/03/2022 1:53 PM] vexorg#0768
thanks for the help, turns out it was the pool. switched it from woolypooly to getblok, no more problems üôÇ


[04/03/2022 5:21 PM] Terremot#4855
Use the same psu for riser and gpu. Do not split, otherwise you risk a fire.

What do you think, will Ergo become significantly more profitable than ETH at some point?


[04/03/2022 7:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes sir, ERGO will be 100% more profitable than ETH when the ETH merge happens üê∏

How can you be so sure? What makes Ergo so special?

well ERGO is guarantee to be 100% more profitable than ETH because you won't be able to mine ETH üòÑ

that will assign the flight sheet to the worker


[04/03/2022 8:16 PM] .Lily#8358
and that should make it start mining automatically?


[04/03/2022 8:16 PM] Terremot#4855
if the flight sheet is set up properly, yes

20xx cards are just bad for mining ergo, why? no idea unfortunatly, it feels bad to say 1080ti‚Äôs do better than a 2080ti but its unfrotunatly a fact‚Ä¶

just bought a mining PC and all my friends at Cardano tell me I should mine ERGO is there an all in one place I read up on how to go about setting everything up. Complete noob here in the mining game sorry for my ignorance.


[04/13/2022 7:46 AM] Terremot#4855
reduce voltage


[04/13/2022 7:47 AM] Terremot#4855
reduce power to between 50-60%


[04/13/2022 7:47 AM] Terremot#4855
and it will become much more efficient


[04/13/2022 7:48 AM] Terremot#4855
on a 2080S, I would get approx 95mhs


[04/13/2022 8:39 AM] MeHow#3154
@Terremot yea the voltage is low when i mine eth


[04/13/2022 8:39 AM] MeHow#3154
since more volt does nothing

Yeah, the 20 series is better for mining cfx


[04/13/2022 8:43 AM] MeHow#3154
but ergo is logically better

[04/13/2022 10:57 PM] coltrain#5970
In a nutshell you need to download a miner (the software, I personally use Trex), identify a pool to point the miner to (I use Woolypooly for solo mining) and get an Ergo wallet (I use the mobile one). There are youtube videos and articles to explain how to do this and this is also the process you'd follow to mine any gpu coin really.

[04/13/2022 10:58 PM] coltrain#5970
You can ask more specific questions once you go through some of the steps above and I'm sure someone will help further, there's probably a ton of info on the official ergo website too in the mining section

[04/14/2022 2:29 AM] ADA Astronaut#2926
have a 800 watt power supply think that's enough power to run both?


[04/14/2022 2:55 AM] coltrain#5970
Yeah, but is it in a closed case? If you are mining 24/7 in a PC you should take the side off and get some air in there. Also since you're flirting with idea of multiple gpus you may just want to move to an open air rig so you can expand later (would need a bigger psu soon though ofc). If it's a PC though vice a dedicated rig suggest u mine for a while you'll probably get miner fomo üòâ and the rest takes care of itself lol


[04/14/2022 2:58 AM] coltrain#5970

Anyone know commands on WIN 11 to get MSI afterburner to re-map after the display adapter have installed in device manager?

My issue is that some of my GPUS are getting error 31 for the driver install so MSI never "sees them" reboots are wonky too with the mobo, most times i'll have to rest to CMOS to get it to reboot into windows OS

[04/23/2022 7:33 PM] Squelch#2324
I have a question for any experienced miners out there mining the autolykos algo for some time now. I cannot find much information on people using 8gb variants of RX cards for this Algo. I know it is very core dependent, and does not rely on memory as much, so is it just an unknown rule to not mine with these 8gb cards? Should i just rely on using the 4gb cards instead? To anyone that has any insight i would very much appreciate it!


[04/23/2022 11:34 PM] flocki#0712
there is no real difference on polaris 4gb or 8gb cards, core/mem settings are the same for the same model e.g. rx580 4/8, and ERG is happy being mined on either model. the ERG DAG file is less than 4gb so it can be mined on any card with 4gb or more.


[04/25/2022 1:08 AM] Dv#3650
It can be mined with 3Gb or more


[04/25/2022 3:07 AM] Squelch#2324
thank you guys so much for the explanation seriously


[04/25/2022 3:10 AM] flocki#0712
Yes, just couldn't remember the current DAG size off top of my head, so just played the safe mark


[04/25/2022 3:21 AM] flocki#0712
are there any 3gb cards that are worth mining ergo with?


[04/25/2022 3:41 AM] Dv#3650
Maybe not now


[04/25/2022 3:42 AM] Dv#3650

I've got an old 290x in my second rig that I was trying to get mining (may switch out the card for a later model when I find something on market place , also can i run 2 different cards for mining since there just computing )

I've tried the latest nb miner i get "algorithm 0 not supported on device"

i tried nano miner but get "gpu 0 open cl call error-4(121)"

srb multi (latest and 7.0) return "couldent return dataset on gpu 0 [Autolykos v.2] .

Have i set up something wrong (ive tried googling nothing relevant comes up) , I've debloated windows 10 , installed amd drivers (the latest stable version)

 one of the miners(i believe nb) did ask if i wanted to switch the gpu to compute mode and i selcted yes not sure if thats what did it

Hi guy's 
i'm pretty new to mining 

I've go a 3080ti mining  in one rig , 2 3060'(lhr)son my 2nd rig, and I have a 2060 12 gig that I'm looking at plugging into my main pc 2nd slot via a riser , should i be looking at solo mining for better returns then a pool ?
If so what resources should i be aware of and what should I read/watch

Any one ran 2 different gens of cards on their daily driver for mining while not gaming ? 
what was your experience ?


also both of my 3060's are lhr , and wont accept the dev 470.05 driver , would i be better to switch the second one in that rig rig for my 12g 2060 ?
Thank you üôÇ

Mining rig has been dropping out sporadically a few times a week. Had been running flawless for a few months now. 

Looks like card 3 just drops to 0 hash and then starts the reboot which this time around failed saying 

t-rex exited (exitcode=1), waiting to cooldown a bit

Skipping miner log rotation due to execution time < 30sec

20220505 10:48:41 ERROR: Can't start T-Rex, number of specified LHR tuning values in config doesn't match the number of GPUs

I'm completely new at troubleshooting. Perhaps I need to update T Rex miner and OS version since it's been about 6 months?

I‚Äôve been trying to solo mine Ergo for a while but I can never get the mining software compiled properly. There isn‚Äôt any reliable links on the mining section of ergoplatform.org‚Ä¶ what gives? The mining handbook link doesn‚Äôt take me to something mining related, and the only blog post related to solo mining I could find is the one from 2019 called ‚ÄúMining Ergo For Fun And Profit‚Äù. I thought there might be a more recent version of Autolykos because the one linked in that post was last updated two years ago: https://github.com/ergoplatform/Autolykos-GPU-miner

So I googled and found a ‚ÄúV2‚Äù here, but it looks sketchy and when I downloaded the source code my Windows Defender detected a trojan and immediately deleted the file: https://github.com/mhssamadani/Autolykos2_NV_Miner. Also, Ergo's official Github has 10 allowed contributors, and mhssamadani is not in it. Does a V2 even exist? Is that 2 year old repo the most up to date? Is there a precompiled version of Autolykos I could just download and run?


[05/09/2022 7:34 PM] carllittle1#3740
Use an off the shelf miner like trex or Lolminer  and point it at your full node address. Just make sure you've got your .bat file configuration right


[05/09/2022 7:35 PM] Forested#2064
You mean to say the official github miner is bad?


[05/09/2022 7:36 PM] carllittle1#3740
The V2 is the right one. Most of the miners out there can mine Autolykos


[05/09/2022 7:36 PM] carllittle1#3740
It's just easier now that the miner devs have added it to the miners they created. No point in trying to reinvent the wheel

As for the Trojan detection that happens with every miner I've tried on windows. A mining program is something that can override the OS and make changes to your system without you even knowing. It's called a DEV FEE

[05/09/2022 7:47 PM] carllittle1#3740

I understand, but if the V2 is the correct one I‚Äôm just surprised there‚Äôs not a link to it on the front page of the website. It seems rather basic to onboard newcomer solo miners‚Ä¶


[05/09/2022 7:52 PM] carllittle1#3740
I don't know what kind of hash rate your attempting to solo with. Most miners use a pool for that like 2 miners or woolypooly where they have a solo option. From there everything is pretty straight forward


[05/09/2022 7:56 PM] Forested#2064
I get that there‚Äôs a way most solo miners are doing it, but I‚Äôm just concerned the only way for people to figure this out is asking members of the community and there‚Äôs no clear onboarding process on the official website except for an article from 2019 that I had to dig for in old blog posts.


[05/09/2022 7:59 PM] Forested#2064

[05/09/2022 8:19 PM] carllittle1#3740
There used to be links to it but this has become commonplace now and as such all the miner devices have implemented it into their programs. And there's no place in any of the miners I've EVER used where I needed to input my private keys.


[05/09/2022 8:21 PM] carllittle1#3740
The difference between Autolykos and V2 is opening it up for "pool" mining


[05/09/2022 8:22 PM] Forested#2064
The config file I used to run the V1 miner required a seed phrase to mine. You‚Äôre saying V2 doesn‚Äôt require this?

I have not tried to complie the miner from source myself. I'm not the technical with things. But the miners I've used like NB miner, LolMiner, Trex,TRM and so on I have not needed to put them in


[05/09/2022 8:26 PM] Forested#2064
Okay, this is good to know! I suppose if I never have to store my keys on my machine or use it for anything else there‚Äôs little risk even if a trojan was present.


[05/09/2022 8:28 PM] carllittle1#3740
Might I ask how much h hashrate you're trying this with?

[05/09/2022 9:10 PM] Forested#2064
I found the V2 repo by MHS via google. I can‚Äôt find any links to it from the mining handbook (what I referred to as official materials). Also, just a gentle critique, but the handbook has a lot of non-mining related content that is confusing to a newcomer. I spent a week going down a dead end trying to compile the V1 miner from source unsuccessfully because I didn‚Äôt find the correct article upfront. I almost gave up entirely and I‚Äôm glad I reached out to the community before leaving.


[05/09/2022 9:13 PM] glasgowm#9381
The `Autolykos2_NV_Miner` one? It's under the Solo Mining section. Could move that up nearer to the top though

[05/09/2022 10:05 PM] Forested#2064
Thank you for updating it! One last question. It looks like t-rex miner and the one by MHS have trojans in them to extract ‚Äúdev fee‚Äù time. Is their no official miner from the foundation that doesn‚Äôt take a dev fee by force? It seems really contradictory to the ethos of ‚Äútrustless and decentralized‚Äù if I have to trust that the trojan I‚Äôm willingly installing isn‚Äôt going to take more than advertised, or is rigged to mine the block in the exact 1% of time they are taking as a fee.


[05/09/2022 10:19 PM] glasgowm#9381
Foundation is more about kickstarting and passing to the community as it'll all ultimately be community-ran. mhs_ published his miner to shorten the gap between public and private; but the trustless and decentralised aspect is anyone having the ability to do this, not that the foundation ensures the public miner beats all private customisations.

Not sure about the technicalities re:trojan. AFAIK this classification was automatic for mining software and not due to code obfuscation. But sure @mhs_sam can clarify any concerns.


[05/09/2022 10:28 PM] Forested#2064
Right, good answer. Cardano has that same approach and I very much appreciate the efforts of the foundation to pass power into the hands of the global community. I‚Äôm not really asking for a guarantee that a public miner would beat private optimizations, but I am expressing a desire to a have an official, less optimized miner from the foundation where no trust, no fees, and no trojans are required. Idk if that‚Äôs how this space works though. I guess I assumed Satoshi him/herself provided a way for people to mine Bitcoin without trust via open source code and most blockchain founders did likewise?


[05/09/2022 10:29 PM] Forested#2064
I‚Äôll definitely ask @mhs_sam directly. If there‚Äôs no fees to run his software or hidden trojan then great! I‚Äôll compile his V2 and get mining right away. So just to be absolutely certain, his `Autolykos2_NV_Miner` is the only official Nvidia miner from the foundation, correct?


[05/09/2022 11:05 PM] glasgowm#9381
Well he built it as a community member originally but is part of the EF now yes. His miner is open source - doubt there's a Dev fee but never actually used it


[05/09/2022 11:42 PM] Forested#2064
Alright, I needed to know that! Just waiting for a response from him now. Thanks for all your help Glasgow üòÑ


[05/10/2022 3:30 AM] mhs_sam#1471
No fees at all! Code is open and anyone can build it himself. 
yes, it is the only official Nvidia miner from the foundation.
Also, I have an optimized version on my hand (not as efficient as closed ones however). I got no time to upload it though. I'll update it soon.

So everything has gone much smoother now with the V2 miner, the only thing I‚Äôm having issues with now is that it can‚Äôt find a certain header file. I re-cloned the latest openSSL from their github repo just to be certain it wasn‚Äôt out of date, but now I‚Äôm wondering if the directory structure has changed since the 1.0.2 release. Your step 3 under Install (Windows 64-bit) that asks you to download OpenSSL 1.0.2 from slproweb.com leads to a 404 not found page üòÖ I‚Äôll try finding a 1.0.2 release somewhere and attempt the build again.

Trying to understand the limits of powering my GPUs with my current cables from my PSU. I have a 3080 ti with 3 x 8 pins. Is it possible to use just 2 PSIe cables from PSU (one w/a splitter) or will I need to use 3? My cables are 18 gauge and my understanding is they have three 12v pins.

"Should" be fine with 2. 18AWG conductor size should allow you for 250W. However, watch for cheap cables as they cheap out on the thermal isolation which is arguably the most important part

[05/26/2022 2:43 PM] Babelfish24#2887
With that hash power it could be months before you hit a block...  It just depends are you willing to wait that long to see any return?  IMO, you should pool mine.

You have to configure the node for mining.  It's not as simple as just firing up the node and directing the miner to the node.

Have you ever ran a miningcore server?  I think I have it all setup now, but I haven't hit a block yet and I'm just sitting here with my fingers crossed that it's all setup correctly...  I have about 12 gh/s and usually hit a block every 24-36 hours. When I was soloing to Woolypooly.  I'd just hate to waste a few days mining to my server and there be a problem... LOL

If you are solo mining to your own node you wouldn't receive shares, that's typically sent from the pool you're mining to even if your solo mining in a pool you just don't get paid on the shares only when you find a block. mining to your own node wont produce "shares".


[06/08/2022 1:57 PM] zzzkky#1782
hi, i have set up the testnet, and solo  mined some blocks, but with different address, prefix with 'm', like this block
https://testnet.ergoplatform.com/en/blocks/ea3dc3df94ef6b1a14c769d9ef1996c53248912e2f7575452af065d18f29425f
and the node wallet shows my address with prefis '3', with 0 balance.
so what't the relation between these two addresses? how can i use the balance from block coinbase?
and what the prefix of mainnet? is there any different?


[06/13/2022 5:22 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
I believe that is your nodes mining public key that starts with m on the testnet, I think on the mainnet it starts with 88 or something. Maybe someone can give you a better explanation on how they communicate with your wallet, but the number that starts with 3 looks like your wallet address.

maybe im to impatient

I dont have that card, but I have 3060TI, 3090, 3090TI. I use MSI afterburner, and found that power limiting and OC the ram gave me the best HR


[06/20/2022 1:36 PM] GeoMax65#0566
My cards are running super cool and using about 40% less power than when I was mining ETH. It's super stable. Rigs have been up for 6 days without any issues mining via nanopool


[06/20/2022 1:39 PM] GeoMax65#0566
I also found that max HR isnt as important as maximizing eff. Tune the power and OC the ram to get the best hash per watt. It's far more profitable that way.


[06/20/2022 1:42 PM] GeoMax65#0566
For example: My 3060TI rig is tuned to PL 57, fans 100%, Core Clock at 0, and memory clock at +1000. I am using t-rex miner. with 6 cards in this rig I am getting 811.34 HR, 678w, and avg eff of 1.20 MH/W


[06/20/2022 1:47 PM] GeoMax65#0566
I found a decrease in hash rate when I pushed the ram higher or added more power. the core clock left alone seemed to give best rate.


[06/20/2022 3:07 PM] Tswift#4005
why would you mine ergo with all those cards right now instead of just mining eth when eth profitability is significantly higher than ergo again right now. you could buy more ergo than mine by far


[06/21/2022 6:32 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
You're right, it's the driver. The 512.95 nerfed the LHR tweak. If you use the older drivers, previous to 512.95 it should be better.


[06/21/2022 6:59 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
Support the network, Less stress on the cards, less heat, less power consumption, maximum efficiency (potentially longer GPU life). Many reasons.


[06/21/2022 7:00 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
A month or 2 ago, you're right you could buy more erg by selling eth than mining erg directly however recently that hasn't been the case.


[06/21/2022 6:58 PM] Tswift#4005
i dont know how you came to that math considering i have the best gpus on the market for ergo (170hx) and they're still calculated at $2.44 per day on eth and $2.02 per day on ergo

[06/22/2022 2:44 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
This is from whattomine a 3060ti @ 15cents per kwh.. I would spend 3 cents more in energy making just 2 cents more profit on eth to me that's not worth the diminishing return or hassle to convert, to mine eth. For me.


[06/22/2022 2:46 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
Besides the fact, GeoMax explained he is currently using 40% less power mining ergo, not everyone is mining and selling everyday also depending on what cards you have the results are different


[06/22/2022 3:21 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
I just watched this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nZDB0gw5rI so it looks like 170hx does 415 mhs at 245w on ergo and 160mhs @ 220w on eth.

[06/22/2022 3:22 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
I can get 6 3060ti's for the price of one of the used 170hx cards @ the current prices $600 vs $4,000 used. Basically build a 6gpu rig that does 1GH/s on ergo for that price of one card... with 2 - 170hx and $8,000 out of pocket on just 2 gpu's nothing else you don't even hit 1 gh's on ergo.. I guess if you're a mining company with a lot of funds to lay out upfront its fine, but for $8,000 I can build 2 6 gpu rigs and have 2gh/s on ergo easily, reselling 3060ti's is also easier. idk those 170hx aren't for me, would never buy one personally but to each his own.


[06/22/2022 3:50 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
So for your card 170hx, yeah it's most profitable to mine eth. For me with 3070's or 3060ti's I'm better off mining ergo.


[06/22/2022 7:26 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
Now that the block reward decreased to 51 erg from 63, of course these numbers are now more in ETH favor again.


[06/22/2022 11:22 PM] Terremot#4855
with my cards, CFX is more profitable, even after power costs


[06/22/2022 11:22 PM] Terremot#4855
Frustrating because I like the ergo project


[06/23/2022 12:25 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
yeah the profitability is going to be changing a lot, at the time ergo yielded more coin and eth yield went down so it was an easy switch.. if you mining for yield and eating electric costs its easier


[06/23/2022 12:27 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
now ergo yield is less but it's still more now than it will be in 3 months so... who knows things going to be changing a lot it seems, not going to be easy and everyone will navigate it differently based on their cards and situation.. personally I eat my electric bill  and just hodl the coins so thats not everyones situation


[06/23/2022 5:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
those 170hx won't be 8k for long lol, wait till nasdaq miners start liquidating

that guy in the video has bad cooling so hes getting throttled


[06/25/2022 4:14 AM] Tswift#4005
170hx is also discontinued now, final batch already shipped from foxconn


[06/25/2022 4:14 AM] Tswift#4005
i also paid under 3k/unit for them back in 2021 so break even was easy


[06/25/2022 4:55 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
Yeah, those cards are good performance wise, they just never pop into my head because I rarely hear about them or consider them. Mostly just base things off of typical consooomur grade hardware, since most of us normies use that.


[06/26/2022 9:07 AM] GeoMax65#0566
ETH mining may make a bit more, but ERG is much easier on my rigs. I hate the heat more than anything. 

All the buying and selling is a pain to track for taxes. I am holding everything anyway. I am paying my electric out of pocket. 

I think Ergo will be a goto for many to mine after ETH, particularly when they figure out how nice it is to mine. 

I mined XEQ, RVN, and SERO for a bit as well. Ergo is my favorite.

I'm using the SRBminer


[07/02/2022 1:02 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
pending balance will go up when the pool finds a block and it gets confirmed, they are a PROP pool not PPLNS so you get a portion of each block based on your hashrate % / Pools overall hashrate at the time the block is mined as opposed to getting a portion based on shares you submit within a specific period of time (PPLNS)


[07/02/2022 1:07 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
Your reward will first become a unconfirmed balance, then move to your pending balance after 72 confirmations

That's perfect my dude


[07/07/2022 4:41 PM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
From what I know if you keep it at those temps your fine


[07/07/2022 4:42 PM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
The hottest mine card ran for a 3060TI if I believe you might have then that should be ok.


[07/07/2022 4:42 PM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
If it hits any higher than like 60 then I would figure another cooling method


[07/07/2022 4:46 PM] nox071218#1778
Yeah 3060ti... The hotest I've seen is 65 but it won't stay there long


[07/07/2022 4:47 PM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
Yea I only have one 3060TI and it slowly ups in temperature. I notice. Plus like It all depends your setup too like my room just gets hot so my temps are higher but they do sit constant at times.


[07/07/2022 4:57 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
You can setup your node on the test net, then just mine it like you normally would. https://docs.ergoplatform.com/dev/start/testnet/


[07/07/2022 4:58 PM] nox071218#1778
So shoot to keep them all under 60 if possible. Ok


[07/07/2022 4:58 PM] 0xMNITY#6979
Getblok also has a testnet : ergo-testnet.getblok.io:3056


[07/07/2022 4:59 PM] C&D Cardboard Games#9820
I mean anywhere above 70 is a problem but like but if your higher then 65 I would start to keep  eyes on it.

you'll needa rebuild the binary for your distro


[08/09/2022 12:46 AM] Setvin#2532
so uninstall u mean?


[08/09/2022 12:48 AM] ziggomatic#9335
uninstall? no. but the binary is currently seeking a different libssl, so probably best to just rebuild it by following the (Linux) parts of https://github.com/mhssamadani/Autolykos2_AMD_Miner#requirements-linux

oh so make from source?


[08/09/2022 12:49 AM] Setvin#2532
no i was using the included thing


[08/09/2022 12:50 AM] Setvin#2532
so i should try to make from source basically


[08/09/2022 12:50 AM] ziggomatic#9335
yeah, that's the part i mean by rebuild


[08/09/2022 12:50 AM] ziggomatic#9335
yep


[08/09/2022 12:50 AM] Setvin#2532
can you tell im new lol


[08/09/2022 12:50 AM] ziggomatic#9335
we all start somewhere


[08/09/2022 12:50 AM] Setvin#2532
im trying to challenge myself to learn linux though


[08/09/2022 12:50 AM] Setvin#2532
most people try to tell you not even to try which not only do I have to learn but also convince people im worth teaching lol


[08/09/2022 12:50 AM] Setvin#2532
alright so let me remake


[08/09/2022 12:51 AM] Setvin#2532
it makes sense to me now why it might now work because the included premade thing is old


[08/09/2022 12:51 AM] Setvin#2532
so theoretically I could clone this and put in my made version


[08/09/2022 12:51 AM] Setvin#2532
and proclaim myself a hero


[08/09/2022 12:51 AM] Setvin#2532
lol


[08/09/2022 12:51 AM] ziggomatic#9335
hehe. yeah it'd be an accomplishment


[08/09/2022 12:52 AM] Setvin#2532
i tihnk im getting ahead of myself let me get it running first


[08/09/2022 12:52 AM] Setvin#2532
i think his documentation could be a bit more clear


[08/09/2022 12:53 AM] Setvin#2532
that is something I could improve on


[08/09/2022 12:53 AM] Setvin#2532
like what got me was I was just following the "quick start guide"


[08/09/2022 12:53 AM] Setvin#2532
which will actually quickly start you on failure since its outdated


[08/09/2022 12:54 AM] Setvin#2532
and the make part says "cd to ubuntu"


[08/09/2022 12:54 AM] Setvin#2532
which for a new user is cryptic


[08/09/2022 12:55 AM] Setvin#2532
it would help to clarify that this is using the source code lol


[08/09/2022 12:56 AM] Setvin#2532
ok making right now

Hi guys , couple of questions .
getting rigs's stable , seems once you go over 4 cards , if you have 4 or more different types (3090,3080ti,3080ti,3060ti. runs fine, but I add 2 1660 supers or a 2060 12GB or a 3070, and good luck getting it going more then 12 hour's, more often 1-4 hours) of card the rig will crash/lock up regularly. 
solutions? or just 2 types of cards per rig the way to go?
Who here has run rigs in a server cabienet , and a custom box , what was your experience ?


[08/09/2022 2:32 AM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Are you running on windows?


[08/09/2022 3:50 AM] blackinsecure#3693
power supply?


[08/09/2022 3:51 AM] deadmanjack#7418
Yep windows 10


[08/09/2022 4:01 AM] deadmanjack#7418
Had the same issue on a parrel miner break-out board with 1400 w power supply,2 750 watt PSU's , and 1650 w silverstone.
Power draw for all circumstances has never set up to draw more than 80% of circuit(240v10a 2400w(1920w continues )  or 80% of power supply rated draw .
on a q270 btc+ board
got a biostar board im setting up tomorrow to see if itll run a mis match of cards


[08/09/2022 4:03 AM] deadmanjack#7418
I've noticed ERGO likes to return more invalid shares,i know there are efforts to make it anti ASCI , should i try on ETH and see if it runs more stable ?


[08/09/2022 4:05 AM] blackinsecure#3693
that's probably some OC issue you're having


[08/09/2022 4:06 AM] blackinsecure#3693
not really supposed to happen without OC or with a well-balanced OC


[08/09/2022 4:06 AM] blackinsecure#3693
it's actually a great indication that something's not right


[08/09/2022 4:16 AM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Yeah that or just windows in general doesn‚Äôt like too many different cards especially when you are overclocking.  With that many cards you may want to try hive.  It‚Äôs free for Ergo.


[08/09/2022 4:18 AM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
You can load it on a flash drive to test it out and just leave your standard hard drive as secondary boot.  Making hive the primary.


[08/09/2022 4:18 AM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
This way if you want to revert back to windows no harm no foul.


[08/09/2022 9:03 AM] deadmanjack#7418
I'll try reducing all mem oc's to stock and see what happens , Thank you üôÇ


[08/09/2022 9:04 AM] deadmanjack#7418
I'll actually give that a crack first, are there any other Linux based mining OSs i should also make myself familiar with?


[08/09/2022 9:07 AM] deadmanjack#7418
A question about 5nm oversupply and hbm being back in production, whats to stop nvidia or amd just making high-performance mining cards ,they have no incentive to not burn there mining customers,the end result for us all will be more out lay whilst difficulty adapts to the new hash power , same for intel alchemist ,coudl move a lot of shit if the memorys fast right ?


[08/09/2022 9:08 AM] deadmanjack#7418

[08/09/2022 9:08 AM] deadmanjack#7418
as well*


[08/09/2022 11:35 AM] blackinsecure#3693
Do that and PL @ 50-60%


[08/09/2022 1:22 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Simple mining, MinerOS, and RaveOS are some of the others.  No personal experience though.

[08/15/2022 11:33 PM] Grimmjow#3983
Hi, I have some questions about ergo mining. In your opinion, is it worth mining with an rtx 3050 laptop?


[08/16/2022 5:24 AM] HippiePyro#9777
hello, ive been trying to use lolminer and nanominer to mine ergo, but they both result in 30% lower hashrate then when i use trex or nbminer with the same settings. im using hives os, do these miners require extra parameters?
i looked through the readme's and dont see anything im missing


[08/16/2022 5:53 AM] blackinsecure#3693
Maybe some LHR shenanigans idk


[08/16/2022 5:53 AM] blackinsecure#3693
I only use NBMiner


[08/16/2022 5:58 AM] HippiePyro#9777
well its not an lhr card, its a p106-90 3gb mining card. maybe something in the code tho. i use nbminer and trex for other ergo subpool coins, but can only run one instance of them, so if i want to mine more than 2 coins with this rig, i need to figure out another miner to use.


[08/16/2022 6:18 AM] HippiePyro#9777
tried an lhr card and had the same results


[08/16/2022 6:13 PM] blackinsecure#3693
you're running two miners on the same card at the same time?


[08/17/2022 4:50 AM] HippiePyro#9777
no, trying to get 3 miners on 3 cards.


[08/17/2022 4:51 AM] HippiePyro#9777
one for each ergo subpool


[08/17/2022 4:52 AM] HippiePyro#9777
but nbminer and trex miners on the only ones delivering full hashrate


[08/17/2022 4:56 AM] HippiePyro#9777
and its not an issues of using multiple miners, because even if i just use lolminer or nanominer as the only miner, neither will produce full hashrate


[08/17/2022 10:41 AM] Elemental#9509
Trex and (Ig now nbminer) are the only ones that fully support ergo mining


[08/17/2022 12:18 PM] HippiePyro#9777
Well that's just dumb on the parts of lolminer and nanominer. Why half-ass support an algo


[08/18/2022 2:47 AM] fasenlo#6222
Is lolminer hitting the full hashrate, but then dropping low then goes up, but not all the way then hits the full again?


[08/23/2022 2:24 PM] lgd#5847
how do i solo mine on testnet with my own node?


[08/23/2022 2:46 PM] divantqc#6850
Is that normal that the hasrate fluctuate so much ?


[08/24/2022 3:21 AM] HippiePyro#9777
no, it goes straight to 2/3 of the potential hashrate and stays there


[08/24/2022 6:20 PM] Terremot#4855
try 1350 core and 1800 mem


[08/24/2022 6:27 PM] Elemental#9509
3060 ti / 3070 hash?


[08/24/2022 6:28 PM] Terremot#4855
I use 1550core and between 2000 and 2600 mem depending on the card


[08/24/2022 6:29 PM] Terremot#4855
3060Ti Hynix is about 135mhs


[08/24/2022 6:29 PM] Terremot#4855
and 3070 is 170-172mhs


[08/24/2022 6:29 PM] Terremot#4855
you can get more if you up the core to 1600 on the 3070


[08/25/2022 5:51 AM] Gainzez#4967

[08/25/2022 1:06 PM] Katrioxx#9256
Is lhr?


[08/25/2022 2:43 PM] JacobMichael#8318
I think I figured this out - the hdmi is running through that gpu. When remote accessing the unit, the hashrate plummets. When not actively viewing the screen it heads back to what I expect to see. We need to move the hdmi to one of the 3060s - they don‚Äôt have as big of a hashrate fall off - because unfortunately the pc is a dell and they have a stupid igx kill switch when a gpu is connected.

From my experimentation I had better MH/s and wattage stability by locking the PL and setting core clock to 0

How CPU intensive should mining ERG be via NBMiner?

I've got two gaming computers with good chips and single cards running at 0-1% CPU usage, but I also have a 6-card rig, LGA1511, with a 3.2GHz Celeron that's maxing out.  99%.

Sounds to me like something is off, or maybe the CMD prompt really does take up that much usage?


[09/02/2022 2:26 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Seems off.  I run a similar CPU on one of my rigs and CPU mine with it while mining erg and get no where near that much utilization.  Also 6 GPUs


[09/02/2022 2:27 PM] √Ör√ñhB√™#8289
Intel(R) Celeron(R) G5905 CPU @ 3.50GHz


[09/02/2022 4:14 PM] Menesenha#9395
Hey! Found it. Took a bit more digging, but turns out I needed to turn HAGS off (hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling). That dropped the CPU usage from 99% to 8% without affecting the hashrate.


[09/02/2022 4:14 PM] Menesenha#9395
Thanks for the confirmation. That helped me dig into it more.

I'm curious if a lot of ETH miners come to ERG will it make it harder to mine and we as miners will mine less hashrate? Sorry if this seems like a completely idiotic question.

50-60% PL and no OC usually give over 1MH/W for the wholw RTX 30 series


[09/08/2022 4:35 AM] Balvand#0653
this is what i run my 3070/3080 founders at:

not my experience, you can push them a little bit and get more, but depends on the gpu

couple example rigs


[09/08/2022 4:37 AM] benzo#8640
i included PLs when migrating rigs from ETH to prevent tripping surge protectors/breakers with power spikes


[09/08/2022 4:38 AM] benzo#8640
which happened when I didn't at least once


[09/08/2022 4:39 AM] benzo#8640
i found that dropping core from 1700 to 1600 saves a good bit of wattage, but YMMV


[09/08/2022 4:40 AM] benzo#8640
but don't get me wrong, loving the temps and the low OCs compared to ETH. it's a plus


[09/08/2022 4:41 AM] blackinsecure#3693
I prefer solving for efficiency than for max nominal HR, and all my cards are set up that way


[09/08/2022 4:41 AM] benzo#8640
same - but i try to maximize the potential of each card. across my 75 GPUs, power went down 10%


[09/08/2022 4:41 AM] benzo#8640
that's good


[09/08/2022 4:42 AM] blackinsecure#3693
out of my 15 cards, only ones that can't get to 1MH/W are the two that came OC'd by default


[09/08/2022 4:42 AM] blackinsecure#3693
never was able to figure them out


[09/08/2022 4:42 AM] benzo#8640
strix or something?


[09/08/2022 4:42 AM] benzo#8640
there's some more power hungry cards, but they're also more capable of OC to account for the extra wattage


[09/08/2022 4:42 AM] benzo#8640
those are the ones to push. i don't push 90% of cards

Hello I am trying to set up minign rig but cannot get a display on monitor. 

I have an i3 Intel chip in an ASUS Z390-P mobo. GPU plugged in directly to thr board with no riser. Buzzer is hooked up and when turned on.. the buzzer beeps one long and 3 short. 

This indicates it‚Äôs a Graphics error. 

Troubleshooting already done: 
- replaced RAM with different RAM stick (multiple times)
- moved GPU to other PCIe slots
- tried 2 other GPUs in other PCIe slots with and without risers


[09/08/2022 5:43 AM] MrRager#9930

if your processor has graphics, try activating it on Bios

variable probably called iGPU

That is a Great Question!!! You may have to enter your Motherboards BIOS and disable PEG (Powered External Graphics) and enable IGFX or INtegrated Graphics so that your motherboard will be your source of HDMI  does that make sense?

Anyone ever heard of an issue where updating the driver software on AMD bricks your GPUs? 

Pre-update - my GPUs were mining just fine, but I couldn‚Äôt overclock them because I needed the AMD software. 

I download software + drivers - now, only 1 of 3 GPUs are mining and only 1 of 3 are showing up in device manager. 

Can someone pls assist? Thank you in advance üôèüèª

I got these rigs second hand and getting rid of Chinese power supply , i was going to use the zsx break out board .
The motherboard get's it's power via pcie plug's, will the breakout board  still power on without the mother board cable being used ?


ignore the card's there my current test cards

Note: also the board takes power THROUGH the pcb from one plug to another plug behind where the cards are intended to be plugged in for neater cable run's , is this safe ?

Hi all. I'm new to mining, but I like Ergo a lot. I bought a boat load of this digital asset as I believe in its bright future. Now, I'm considering mining Ergo (and possibly Flux). But I'm pretty much starting from scratch. I allocated a budget of $1000 total for all hardware/software needed to setup a functioning mining system. My question is I need specific recommendation for the hardware to buy and the step by step procedure to set it up. What would be the most straight forward option for me hardware wise? Any specific links? Thanks.


[09/15/2022 2:52 AM] benzo#8640
you should not consider buying anything for at least a week, maybe a month. see how the market settles, then reevaluate.

I would assume it's an overclock setting problem if hashrate is low. Possibly try different software.

How do I do that? Sorry new to this type of mining


[09/17/2022 5:40 AM] DJN 69#1607

[09/17/2022 10:21 AM] blackinsecure#3693
use Ergo Wallet or Nautilus or Satergo

Ok thanks will try. Got yorio because I could swap to ADA


[09/17/2022 10:23 AM] blackinsecure#3693
yeah for long it was the only wallet but they stopped developing and others became much better


[09/17/2022 10:26 AM] DJN 69#1607
Which one is the better out of the 3 you suggested


[09/17/2022 10:30 AM] blackinsecure#3693
I use Ergo Wallet most of the time


[09/17/2022 10:31 AM] blackinsecure#3693
Nautilus if I wanna interact with a DEX


[09/17/2022 10:31 AM] blackinsecure#3693
but both are fine


[09/17/2022 10:33 AM] DJN 69#1607
Thanks I'll try them out.


[09/17/2022 10:57 AM] DJN 69#1607
How do I add the new wallet so I don't lose my last payment and am then able to remove yorio?


[09/17/2022 11:48 AM] blackinsecure#3693
just use the same seed phrase on the different wallet app


[09/17/2022 11:49 AM] blackinsecure#3693
all of them are just UIs


[09/17/2022 12:36 PM] DJN 69#1607
So open another wallet in say Nautilus and use my seed phrase from yorio? Or I don't understand


[09/17/2022 1:58 PM] schmaudog#1565
yes exactly that

So I'm not sure if I'm an idiot or not. But I'm trying to get one of my rigs up and running on hiveos. Have been mining ETH for over a year and a half and haven't touched it. I've watched videos on YouTube on how to mine ergo. And basically it is set up a new wallet on hive OS. Then create a flight sheet with a pool. And then hit the little rocket ship. Everything looks like it's applied but when I open up the mining rig itself on hive os. It's up and running but the miner will not start mining. So I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, any suggestions?


[10/02/2022 12:42 AM] digdug#5494
not sure if it will let you, can you screenshot waht you see on hiveos

there is my flight sheets. I see one difference in my old ETH flight sheet where it shows more are the " URL " under teamredminer. other than that.  its all correct, in my eyes


[10/02/2022 12:45 AM] digdug#5494
Im guessing you have only AMD cards in your rigs?


[10/02/2022 12:46 AM] Sgtfluffy16#5007
correct


[10/02/2022 12:46 AM] Sgtfluffy16#5007
and ive tried it with 2 different wallets and 2 different mining pools. same result


[10/02/2022 12:47 AM] digdug#5494
Im sure you've tried rebooting the rigs too


[10/02/2022 12:49 AM] Sgtfluffy16#5007
yes, through the dashboard. no hard reboots though


[10/02/2022 12:51 AM] Sgtfluffy16#5007
could it be something with missing the " Pass "  or the URL is just show as " %URL% "  which is different from the ETH flight sheet


[10/02/2022 12:52 AM] digdug#5494
Mmmm I dont think so, as long as you did the default drop-down choice in HiveOS while making your flightsheet, it looks like mine.
@herominers.com not sure if you're here.


[10/02/2022 12:53 AM] Sgtfluffy16#5007
yes, i used everything in the dropdown boxes other than inputting my wallet address as a copy and paste


[10/02/2022 12:53 AM] digdug#5494
Should be working, then.  I'd try changing miners and rebooting first, start there. Rule out TRM.

the OC i have in here other than for my 5700XT's are all tried and true workings. the 5 RX580's are identical. so if one works they should all work.

is the memtweak still there? I had an issue like that on my Vega 56's a while back, where even when I deleted the memtweak, it was still present


[10/02/2022 1:57 AM] Sgtfluffy16#5007
i see it on the one 5700xt... but i don't even have an option to remove it oddly enough


[10/02/2022 1:59 AM] Sgtfluffy16#5007
i found a way to remove it... i had to click on the "all" config button. and removed it that way


[10/02/2022 2:00 AM] Sgtfluffy16#5007
this is VERY slow to get up and running compared to ETH. I guess i will just keep doing reboots until they all start mining. they are all seen just not mining


[10/02/2022 2:05 AM] Sgtfluffy16#5007
@digdug got them all up and running... any suggestions on OC's? i will let it run for a bit. the 580s 5 and 6 i need to change some more. but no clue what to change the 5700xt to

Hey guys, I tried getting one of my old rigs to getblok.io.
I get regularly connection time outs.
I used EU and the main address. 
Other pools work OK. Anyone can confirm that?

[10/02/2022 4:20 PM] essaias#5787
alright, ignore that. the miner drops the connection bcs it thinks its dead. (but actually it is alive, guess slow block times and/or my low hash rate :-D) - increased timeout setting, and working now

I'm mining Ergo on herominers using Lolminer 1.61. I have 4 different rigs, 3 with 6 RX580s and 1 rig with just 1 Rx580. The rig with 1 card keeps stopping. When i say stopping i mean Lolminer keeps running but the card drops to 0 hash rate. It's not overclocked at all and running on windows using Afterburner. The temps are low so it's not overheating. Any ideas?


[10/22/2022 3:24 PM] schmaudog#1565
My first guess would be to try teamredminer for this one card, see how it goes.


[10/22/2022 3:26 PM] schmaudog#1565
I've had issues with lolminer not playing nice with other mining software, or if you are trying to mine just one card, and omitting others. Not sure what your setup is like


[10/22/2022 4:08 PM] vectisitch#8900
This rig only has the one card directly into the pcie slot. No riser. It mined flux OK with lolminer. Very odd


[10/22/2022 4:17 PM] schmaudog#1565
That is odd. Same drivers as other rig? Maybe play with OCs. Monitor hooked up? Lower mem ocs, raise core ocs? I did have a card I just returned, would not mine flux. Any algo fine, flux gave errors


[10/22/2022 5:15 PM] vectisitch#8900
I've underclocked it same drivers. I'll dismantle the rig tomorrow  and rebuild it. The drivers are the old amd mining specific drivers I used when mining eth on claymore. I'll update them to latest too


[10/22/2022 5:45 PM] vectisitch#8900
Well i can't update the drivers as i'm using win 10 enterprise but i'm trying TRM now


[10/22/2022 6:02 PM] schmaudog#1565
Hopefully it's just something like lolminer doesn't play nice with that driver version...


[10/22/2022 6:57 PM] vectisitch#8900
My other 3 rigs with 6 cards seem OK though. I think it could be a dodgy card maybe.


[10/23/2022 9:26 AM] vectisitch#8900
Happy to report TRM has stayed working all night on the rig with one card. Hash rate is a little better than Lolminer too. So I'll move the other rigs onto TRM


[10/23/2022 2:11 PM] schmaudog#1565

[10/24/2022 4:23 PM] DishBrain#1197
Hey there, I set up a solo node and have been mining to it from my rig getting valid shares and everything looked peachy keen. 
Last night I hit a block, my log files shows the block number.
But when I go look at that block in the list of latest blocks on ergo explorer, it shows that it was mined by some other address completely. Anyone know what might be going on?  

Edit: Answered below!


[10/24/2022 7:45 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
This is likely your specific mining reward address, where your ERG will go for 720 blocks. After that point, your node wallet will automatically spend ERG from this wallet and include it in your balance. There should be an api call to verify your mining reward address on the node.


[10/24/2022 9:17 PM] DishBrain#1197
Ahhh, ok, that makes sense. Thanks! I'll go run that API call and see if that matches up. Appreciate it!


[10/24/2022 9:20 PM] DishBrain#1197
Yup! That was exactly it, did the /mining/rewardAddress API call and it matched up. üëç  Thanks again!


[10/24/2022 11:39 PM] EPaZ#6901
so in case someone hit a block the reward is sent to a reward address where it stays 720 blocks before reaching the solo miner wallet?


[10/25/2022 5:42 PM] DishBrain#1197
A couple of follow up questions. in ErgoStratumServer start.js I have the address set as my personal wallet address. The same one I've been using while mining to pools. I've imported this wallet into my Node, so when I unlock my wallet, this is the one I see details about. I also have that as my address in the config on my rig that is mining to my node(same as I would have when that rig would've mined to a pool). Should that address in start.js be my mining specific reward address instead, while leaving the rig configuration as is?  I'm asking because the transaction of 57 ERG to my mining specific address now shows over 900 confirmations now, but it hasn't transferred any to my personal address.  However, in my Node UI, the total balance does show a combination of my personal wallet balance, plus 45 ERG, which I know is the block reward after the 12 ERG re-emission. Do I need to make an API call from within Swagger to initiate the transfer to my personal wallet manually?  Thanks!


[10/26/2022 6:49 PM] DishBrain#1197

Can even i host non asic machines at data centers ?


[10/28/2022 8:01 PM] DishBrain#1197
Just for funsies I just tried sending funds from the Node Wallet GUI, to my personal address, the same one show. As my wallet in Node. I tried sending 5 ERG, then looking at the transaction on Ergo explorer, it shows my rewardAddress sending both the 5 ERG I told it to send, and the other 40 ERG to my personal wallet all in one transaction.  As well as the. 12 ERG remission fee to wherever that goes. So, all good I guess!

I'm moving my GPU farms into cabinet's , i've brought some nice sotrage lockers ,about 400 mm deep ,1500 wide ,1000 tall , perfect for putting GPU mining racks in (im building them custom for the box) along side the hardware to run em.
I intend to cut 120mm/140mm/200mm holes on the back plate depending on where i end  place hardware ,and leaving the front storage doors open, and getting a fiber board or albumin sheet for the front and cutting 120mm/140mm/200mm holes into for fans on the front/  air filter panel.

The over engineering is required as these 2 unit's are for the shared rental i live at , so space/noise/easy heat magmeant (dumping it outside via window with ducting).

  is there something I've overlooked in my build 
and
 what options exist for managing  20~30 fans , i would use the break out boards for fan power and spreading's the fans out amongst the psu's  but will be using atx supplies for noise reasons ,i know i can split them out from Molex and sata  but if there is another way ?

Would one or two larger exhaust fans make more sense than 20-30 little pc fans?


[11/24/2022 1:58 AM] Jpow#2124
should prob look for a 10-12 inch duct turbine or high CFM fan. 20-30 case fans with high CFM is gonna cost you a bundle and probably will struggle to exhaust air through the window.

Hi guys i'm having some problems with my ergo node paying out.  I've asked in a couple different rooms here and I haven't been able to get any support.

Airflow is always a bit hit or miss. Intake you won't need fan, just screen.

any one else having trouble connecting to 2 miners and nanopool
EDIT: seems to just be my local network , what could cause that and what should i investigate ?


[12/08/2022 3:31 AM] DiscoCryptos#9513
Youre SOLO mining to your own node??


[12/08/2022 3:34 AM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
Well not really... when i have a pool and i need to jump start it. I guess it's solo mining.... lol

I believe I have the power but i really cant afford to mine for literally nothing


[12/08/2022 5:02 AM] iotapi322 vipor.net#9019
But next run it should be worth more than nothing


[12/08/2022 5:11 AM] DiscoCryptos#9513
Agreed but I am talking Nothing as in mining solo and NOT hitting blocks. Id rather poo, for pennies than solo for possibly nothing


[12/08/2022 4:12 PM] cannon#3541
From what I've seen in discussions and videos one fan should be able to handle most GPUs, are you using inline fan to exhaust or what?


[12/08/2022 10:37 PM] deadmanjack#7418

[12/13/2022 3:44 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
@Cheese Enthusiast I mined a block a day and a half ago. The balance on my node wallet shows 45 ergo but the available balance shows 0. Is this because the block is not validated yet or is there something I need to do to release the funds?


[12/13/2022 3:45 PM] Cheese Enthusiast#0548
If it hasnt been 720 blocks yet, then balance hasnt been validated yet either. If it has, then it may be an orphan or your node wallet may need to be resynced.


[12/13/2022 3:52 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
@Cheese Enthusiast if it was an orphan it wouldn't show the balance of 45 ergo in the node wallet would it? I'll wait a few more hours and if it doesn't show I will try resynchronization of the node. Thanks


[12/14/2022 2:01 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
I mined a block 2 days ago. Balance shows in my wallet but when I go to available balance it shows .02 available. It has been over 720 confirmations.

[12/14/2022 3:03 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
@glasgowm yes. I will give you some background on what's going on. The 3 previous blocks found came in and paid out on the pool just fine. Someone hacked into the server and they deleted the pool frontend and postgres database. The block in question was found before the hack but was only halfway through confirmation when they deleted the database and frontend. They deleted the node so I resynced the node with a backup of the wallet. The wallet shows a balance for the block but when I go to available balance it showed .02 balance. I sent a payment to the wallet of .3 erg and the wallet received the payment just fine.

What's showing on-chain? On the explorer. Do you have the re-emission tokens?


[12/15/2022 3:26 PM] miningcrypto.live#1846
@glasgowm that's my biggest problem. I don't know what block number or the transaction. The server was wiped when the block was waiting for confirmation.. I'm guessing it's going to be a loss even though the wallet shows a balance of 45 ergo.


[12/15/2022 3:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
Try `/scan/unspentBoxes/9` ?


[12/15/2022 3:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
And can you see the erg/anything else on the mining rewards address?


[12/15/2022 3:28 PM] glasgowm#9381
`/mining/rewardAddress`

[01/29/2023 10:37 AM] ivchobow#6030
Which miner?


[01/29/2023 5:02 PM] Jpow#2124
@KangaRoo You got 3 gpu and 6 vga port on ur PSU, no reason to use spliters to power the risers. Use the auxilary ports to power up the risers with either molex or 6 pin.


[01/29/2023 5:06 PM] Jpow#2124
if the splitters are decent gauge you prob wont have any problems, but with that setup you're letting the rig pull 225 watts from that splitter so you better be sure.


[01/31/2023 8:44 PM] KangaRoo#2527
I‚Äôm working on this with the guy I bought the frame from. We are able to get the miner working with only 1 GPU (the Hive OS boots, the miner connects, and everything works).


[01/31/2023 8:45 PM] KangaRoo#2527
However, when multiple GPUs are connected, the OS doesn‚Äôt boot


[01/31/2023 8:46 PM] KangaRoo#2527
We‚Äôve been troubleshooting and can‚Äôt figure out what could be the problem


[01/31/2023 8:47 PM] KangaRoo#2527
We swap cables, swap risers, swap power cables, swap PCI slots


[01/31/2023 8:58 PM] Drago Calta#6755
Check the settings in the mainboard BIOS - the item "above 4G encoding" has to be enabled, CSM support has to be disabled, all PCI slot speeds should be set to Gen1

This sounds like CSM Mode to me, its in the bios settings, my rig often will turn it on by its own so Ill have to go in with one card and turn CSM off, generally I dont have to do it more than a few times a month if Im restarting my rig a lot that month

[02/02/2023 11:06 PM] KangaRoo#2527
I don't think I'm gonna touch the rig before my Colombia trip, but I do want to learn how to optimize my mining. It is clear that one of the cards was optimized in its BIOS for mining, as it is more efficient than the other two (it's doing 110W for a 155 Mhz hashrate). 

I have 3 Radeon VIIs running on Hive OS, which I think is linux. Do we know what settings I should use on Hive OS? Resources on this topic seem scant (though hopefully y'all know of one or two I could browse).  

My other two cards are getting 125W for 165 Mhz hashrate.  Supposedly Radeon VIIs can get 150W for 250 Mhz hashrate. I don't care if I am that efficient, but I'd like to narrow the large delta between my current performance and that optimum performance.

Hey, I want to start mining but I never mined before

I am very familiar with defi however


[02/04/2023 6:56 PM] Bullskey#6363
can anyone please guide me through ? First I am wondering whether I should join a mining pool or mine on my own. I heard that on Ergo mining difficulty is way lower so I can just use my laptop. I am worried however on whether or not my laptop will break? I use it everyday.


[02/05/2023 5:19 AM] KangaRoo#2527
I can tell you right now that you shouldn't mine with a laptop. Sounds like a bad idea.

üíØ 

[02/05/2023 5:19 AM] KangaRoo#2527
I'm new too, but there's no way you'll be efficient unless you just mine at a coffee shop all day while you're working


[02/05/2023 6:03 PM] deathgripson#2395
ergo difficulty is not that low at the moment, you will need at least a decent discrete GPU to mine. 3060ti for example does pretty well but not a laptop kind, one with good cooling. Laptop mining very well could fuck up your laptop so I would only do it with ones  you consider dead / free power usage. Mining to a pool wont make you a lot but it will at least make you some Ergo. Pick one of the smaller pools, not too small and not the biggest but a pool that is hitting blocks consistently. Reason laptop mining is bad is because the entire laptop motherboard and all absorbs the heat from the GPU, in a mining rig the GPU is completely separated from other parts leading to good cooling, performance, and no heat degradation.

[02/06/2023 1:36 PM] deathgripson#2395
no problem, it is possible some CPU algorithms wont kill a laptop but youll have to do research on that yourself. you could theoretically just CPU mine and swap into Ergo or use unmineable as a service to do that for you, but yea otherwise you may have to buy in. For the upcoming hackathon I am working on atomic solutions for crosschain swaps so people can swap in from chains they are already on

Can it be any type of gpu?

like putting the cable in a different gpu

because if its not getting into hive and no display, imo it may be csm mode is turned on and you gotta turn it off

also cmos reset may be in order if this type of stuff is happening randomly to bios but that might just be my experience

I'd say do a completely fresh HiveOS install on a Flash Drive and try to boot from there.  If that doesn't work, we can rule out a decent amount of things


[04/06/2023 10:33 PM] deathgripson#2395
yea thts a good idea, only other things i can think of are try hitting bios hotkey on startup, or maybe cmos reset

I did a fresh hive on a new flash from the beginning. He was running windows. He suggested maybe clearing the hard drive? I know exactly dick about computers so my learning curve is steep.


[04/07/2023 3:35 AM] deathgripson#2395
are you sure it installed correctly? is it on a usb? if so make sure its in a main motherboard slot, make sure to hit the relevant bios hotkey when starting up from there you can verify that more things are working


[04/07/2023 3:38 AM] deathgripson#2395
try a cmos reset as well


[04/07/2023 3:38 AM] deathgripson#2395
also what hard drive does it have? it should only have one drive which is the usb or ssd you put hive os on, reinstalling that may be good to do


[04/09/2023 11:41 PM] dissentralize#5971
So it's not supposed to have a hard drive and a USB?


[04/09/2023 11:42 PM] deathgripson#2395
it could i guess but technically u just need enough to run hiveos i think


[04/10/2023 12:09 AM] dissentralize#5971
Cool, I'll disconnect the hard drive and try again. Digging in again tomorrow, Easter w the fam today. Also just want to say thank you for all of the time and insight you've provided. Super cool to find help on something I know absolutely dick about. I figure the only way to learn is to jump in but I've never been a computer guy so learning curve is steep.

I have been getting invalid shares rather frequently when mining ERGO.  It is showing up in HiveOS.  Even the number of shares is increasing in some instances.  It is happening across a few cards some fairly new gpus, some a bit older.  What can I do to prevent invalid shares?

The invalid shares have been happening on Nvidia 3000 series cards, my AMD cards rarely get invalid shares

one of my breakout boards for a  server power supply seems to have died even though it has zero signs of failure very strange, i replaced it with an extra (always buy 3 lol) and its working just fine, theres no signs of damage on the broken one and even the standby light works

I seem to be getting more invalid shares in the past month or so.  Should I be rebooting my rig as invalid shares accumulate? Any else having this issue?

I'm not getting any invalid shares on my AMD cards - only Nvidia 3000 series.  Might look into updating Nvidia drivers if I can.  I've updated miner and HiveOS version

Interesting, my amd rigs had this issue for a little while but it stopped happening randomly, it may have had to do with the pool setup, im running my own pool so i can just restart the stratum but maybe changing pool servers would wor otherwise. With nvidia I had the issue that it was dropping to low hashrate randomly I upgraded to nvidia driver:  525.85.05 and since then it has been up for several days at consistent hashrate
