This channel is going to be for user feedback for people testing the ergo android wallet. 

We will set up a group of users, and fund their testing via the telegram tipbot.


[07/02/2021 3:32 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I will take a look into this channel regularly üôÇ

How To Sideload Apps
Android apps come in the form of a file called an APK. Let‚Äôs say you want to get an APK of the Google Play store. If you have an Android TV device, it will have a very limited version of the Play store if it even has one at all. So what you‚Äôll want to


[07/02/2021 3:46 PM] glasgowm#9381
Installed fine on mine without sideloading


[07/02/2021 3:49 PM] CypherPet#3447
Same,  installed fine and looking good üî•ü•∞


[07/02/2021 3:50 PM] glasgowm#9381
beautiful, seems to work perfectly


[07/02/2021 3:50 PM] glasgowm#9381
It said 7(02) USD on a fresh wallet though


[07/02/2021 3:51 PM] CypherPet#3447
It's the price


[07/02/2021 3:51 PM] CypherPet#3447

[07/02/2021 3:51 PM] glasgowm#9381

Got me confused for half a second too lol


[07/02/2021 3:52 PM] glasgowm#9381
I'd use the orangey logo on the settings page - quite hard to see the black one


[07/02/2021 3:53 PM] CypherPet#3447
Which logo?

The logo is black on white for light mode and white on black for dark for me. It's pretty easy to see.


[07/02/2021 3:59 PM] CypherPet#3447
Love the syncing animation too


[07/02/2021 4:00 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
it's the same ergo explorer has üôÇ


[07/02/2021 4:09 PM] CypherPet#3447
Why is there an"amount" and "reason" on the recieved tab? I might understand the "reason" but is this stored anywhere?

[07/02/2021 4:12 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
it is a feature from ergo explorer. it is not stored but encoded in the qr code. if you tap the share button you'll see the generated url and will understand

ok I will check. it seems you can't switch to light mode?


[07/02/2021 4:14 PM] glasgowm#9381
it changes but they are both dark


[07/02/2021 4:14 PM] glasgowm#9381

Just tried with Sigmausd and yup, it's not working


[07/02/2021 4:42 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
most important is that it is not working gracefully, so you as a user know what is the problem


[07/02/2021 4:43 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
what version are you all using btw? release or debug?


[07/02/2021 4:43 PM] CypherPet#3447
Release


[07/02/2021 4:44 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
cool, thanks for trusting me. testing the minified version is most important to me because minification can introduce problems


[07/02/2021 4:45 PM] TheArabicCowboy#6071
Just downloaded it without sideloading as well, looks good so far

It depends if you're on testnet or mainnet.

Does the wallet talk directly to the blockchain or does it use an external node?


[07/02/2021 4:50 PM] DenAce#1197
Nice work!it's showing 7 08 USD though


[07/02/2021 4:50 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
for sending, it talks directly to the blockchain. for showing balance, it uses ergo explorer api. so not directly with the blockchain, but not over a third party server

[07/02/2021 4:51 PM] TheArabicCowboy#6071
Should we be testing both the testnet and the mainnet wallets?


[07/02/2021 4:52 PM] DenAce#1197
ahh that explains it


[07/02/2021 4:52 PM] DenAce#1197
maybe 1 ERG = ... USD?


[07/02/2021 4:52 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
maiinnet release is the most important for me. it depnds on how much you trust me. if you don't want to test real ERGs use testnet


[07/02/2021 4:54 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yeah, will change it that way


[07/02/2021 4:55 PM] FrankyThreeFingers#6488

I have noticed the problem but i am not sure if BTC as comparison makes any sense. It is just shown because Coingecko supports it and the app does not filter

Okay, to have some more overview how many people tested, I would like to have the testers click a reaction here on two questions:
If you tested the RELEASE apk and sucessfully send funds, please click your Android version number here (plus for 11/12)

Restoring an Android wallet to a node works fine. Node to Android gives me an unusable adress. I have used derive key for my node wallet though. maybe that does something?

[07/02/2021 11:06 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Yeah, derived keys are not (yet) supported on the android wallet. Only the first address can be used


[07/02/2021 11:07 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
The address should be usable nevertheless


[07/02/2021 11:07 PM] DenAce#1197
But don't you restore all adresses at once by entering mnemonic sentence?


[07/02/2021 11:08 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
But what is the intention of watching the wallets without seeing a thing? ü§î


[07/02/2021 11:08 PM] DenAce#1197
for yoroi only my last adress created was displayed


[07/02/2021 11:09 PM] XupEdd#4749
Like making a video for internet tutorials, or showing another person but only the interface and operations.


[07/02/2021 11:10 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Only the first one is restored. There is more or less an indefinite list, and Android Wallet just uses the first list entry at the moment


[07/02/2021 11:10 PM] DenAce#1197
The one restored for testing with node wallet wasn't a correct one.


[07/02/2021 11:11 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042

That's true, I can't send an Erg either. How did you restore it, you entered a mnemonic? As it is on testnet, maybe you can pm me the mnemonic that creates such an unusable address


[07/02/2021 11:17 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I also think so, but should be optional. Activating it suppresses some other stuff, for example screen shots

Right, something like that.

Yes you have to replace it.
Note that the 0.6 versions can't send payments on testnet at the moment I forgot to add the hint on the latest release


[07/03/2021 7:29 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Yes, good idea


[07/03/2021 8:23 AM] QT#5620
Hi new guinea here slight suggestion can you add some sort of symbol to denote a read-only wallet. It is probably redundant since you can rename said wallet to the name of the wallet in yoroi or better yet can maybe just hide the send button on read-only wallet and center the receive button


[07/03/2021 9:16 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
At the moment send button is grayed out but maybe that's not as apparent, so hiding it is a good idea


[07/03/2021 9:17 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
In my opinion the naming "read only" could be improved too, but i couldn't come up with a better wording.

My new wallet has 12 words for mnemonic password (The one created automatically by Telegram's tipbot)


[07/03/2021 4:29 PM] JOFLITO#9983
it would be cool to add 12 word password wallets, since I can't restore it in this new app


[07/03/2021 4:34 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
12 words? I can check if that works but i have no way to validate if the generated address is correct. Can't compare because the two existing wallets use 15 words. Or was there an option on Yoroi


[07/03/2021 4:35 PM] JOFLITO#9983

Now it's pretty easy since the fee is 0.001ERG, but maybe it's a good idea to add an option to send "all funds"


[07/03/2021 6:34 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Thought about that, but it is really needed when the wallet is not used just for testing?


[07/03/2021 7:00 PM] QT#5620

Oh ok, my bad!


[07/04/2021 7:00 AM] QT#5620
Ok so send with biometric verification on Android 10 is not working at least not for me. Keeps returning security error: user not authenticated. Will reinstall and recover wallet and see if it fixes itself.


[07/04/2021 7:02 AM] QT#5620
Armeanio eventually got to me


[07/04/2021 7:13 AM] QT#5620
So somehow it allowed me the first time to create the wallet with biometric verification but this time went to recover and it wouldn't let me add the wallet via biometric. When choosing that option got the same error above. Will try once more and then chalk it up to something with the app as I use biometric verification to both unlock my phone and with other apps.


[07/04/2021 7:29 AM] QT#5620

[07/04/2021 10:07 AM] QT#5620
@MrStahlfelge transactions smaller and moved to the right of the fiat value of the wallet, the erg value synced text more centered in relation to the ergo logo up top, and the add wallet button bigger and centered in relation to the ERG Logo and lined up with the edit symbol on each wallet. Since the transactions text is smaller and moved can reduce the screen space that each wallet takes up in the app so I cut some space out of the area between the wallet symbol and the view transactions button.  You could further remove more space and prob allow for 2 wallets to be visible completely buttons and all. The aesthetics might suffer because of that. I tried cutting more space out there and it just looked off.  I think the size of each wallet in the above mockup kind of resembles the wallet symbol. As for the authentication problem I'm on a Pixel XL.


[07/04/2021 12:13 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Sometimes it helps to switch off authentication and reset it in android settings.


[07/04/2021 6:42 PM] DenAce#1197
@MrStahlfelge what do you think about moving the sending overview up so you can see everything when inputting adress and amount?

I probably need to remove the transaction label completely as next version of ergo api does not return it. I think it is not that important anyway. 

as for the overall size of a wallet, I have no idea how much wallets typical users probably use. my guess is: many only use a single one, while some use a whole bunch. difficult to satisfy both needs.


[07/04/2021 10:33 PM] XupEdd#4749
For more vertical space efficiency, maybe we can unify the send screen according to the receive screen.
1. Move the send text and QR code scanning icon to the top banner. (or the QR code icon in the right side of the address input field.)
2. Remaining cell of content can now goes just beneath the banner. (And highlighted the wallet name just like the receive's one.)
3.(Optional) Make the send button with Android floating button style which can stay constantly at the bottom-right of the screen.


[07/04/2021 10:34 PM] XupEdd#4749
If we get the address book in the future, that icon can goes beside where QR code icon at.

oh that's encouraging to hear! I thought it was pretty good that you offered to improve the grammatical problems on the sheets, because in most cases the native speakers don't do that because it is viewed as being impolite to correct such mistakes. however, we non-native speakers can only learn that we made a mistake when we get corrected so I actually admire when it is done. thanks!


[07/05/2021 9:06 AM] iamlindoro#0491
I think the urge to help is never impolite, but nitpicking grammar is generally seen as petty, as though you were looking for reasons to find faults. That's why I wanted to be 110% clear that my goal is to help give a strong first impression, and not to be an annoyance.


[07/05/2021 9:07 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
another question regarding this one: do you use fingerprint or face recognition? does it happen when you save the wallet or did saving work and the error comes up when you want to pay or show the mnemonic?


[07/05/2021 9:07 AM] iamlindoro#0491
Wish I had an android device to see the strings in context (to check things like capitalization) but I can try


[07/05/2021 9:09 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
if you are really willing to invest some time and because you said you are a developer, Android Studio is one of the easiest experiences to get something to run. Download the IDE and clone the repo, and if you are on Mac or Linux that will be all you have to do to get the app to run on the provided emulator


[07/05/2021 9:10 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042

@MrStahlfelge Pending outgoing is the only thing not shown ;).


[07/05/2021 7:03 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
that bothers me, too. to get better, the app has to save and handle transactions in app. that's the topic "In app transactions list and details" which is some more effort. 
after a short period of time, when the network processed the transaction, the outgoing balance can be seen because an unconfirmed balance is shown. however, the amount is wrong in most cases... which I can't change, it is the explorer api returning the amount.


[07/05/2021 7:04 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042

Is it safe to store my erg on this wallet? With China fud and coinex based in China, there's a real need for this


[07/06/2021 12:20 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
the keys are safed either password-encrypted (AES128) or encrypted by user authentication on your local device and never shared elsewhere. Safety of encryption by user authentication depends on your device manufacturer and Android version. It is also an AES encryption, but instead of using the password the data to decrypt your secrets is stored within a special area of the Android OS or the device. I would say if you are concerned about governments, better use password encryption with a long password. Both methods are safe against brute force attacks by today's standards, but at the moment there is still no code audit given to my implementation (code is here: https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/ergo-wallet-android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/api/AesEncryptionManager.java)
Safest method is of course to use a cold wallet: Generate the wallet with the app, store the mnemonic on a paper but not in app, copy the P2PK adress and use it.

that's a serious issue, thanks for reporting.

I did not think of non-English users or such phrase recommendations. I can turn of automcomplete for the field

@MrStahlfelge looking into the code, looks really good. One problem though, the dependencies are being downloaded without source jars, so I cannot jump to the sources of the Android SDK. Any idea how to resolve it?


[07/07/2021 9:30 AM] morphic#4133
The same for Kotlin std libs, cannot see sources. At the same time Appkit sources can be resolved and downloaded on demand.


[07/07/2021 9:34 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yeah unfortunately there is no way to look into Android SDK conviniently. It is annoying, especially because the code is not on GitHub but on Google sources, but I think the reason is that the code might be no Java code but native code. I usually rely on the Android documentation.
I had no need to look into Kotlin yet, but some classes can be decompiled by the IDE in my experiences when you turn on decompilation feature of Android Studio.

in my opinion it is up to the user if he wants that, some people might want to save the screenshots or print it even when it is not as secure as writing it manually. so this could be added as an optional setting.

@MrStahlfelge I wonder what is the database schema of the app, I found 3 entities, but only single Dao class with queries referencing 2 tables?


[07/07/2021 2:27 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
the third (https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/ergo-wallet-android/blob/dbcb8cde413937ca97757a7b78bb100d279925a7/app/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/android/wallet/WalletDbEntities.kt#L25) is no "real" db entity (no @Entity annotation), but the logical db entity of the wallet configuration and state. So, yes, there are two tables present. There are two ways to see the schema: when you compile, room generates the actual implementations - you can find a AppDatabase_Impl file containing the code to create and access the db there. More easy and with the actual data shown is to use the database inspector with the emulator: https://developer.android.com/studio/inspect/database


[07/07/2021 2:52 PM] morphic#4133
thanks, the Inspector is cool. From wallet_states I infer there may be many states for one wallet, but publicAddress is PrimaryKey (not ForeignKey), so it is actually 1-to-1 relation, right?


[07/07/2021 2:54 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yes, at the moment it is. the idea between having two tables is 1) the sync only needs to write to state and thus it is made sure no config data is lost (access is handled by Room so I wanted to play absolutely safe), and 2) the state table is already prepared for when addresses can be derived.

no problem. storing on device is linked to the class I already linked, the AesEncryptionManager. Search for the calls to its methods to find where the mnemonic is encrypted and decrypted.
Mnemonic generation is exactly here https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/ergo-wallet-android/blob/989b2548e413e3bfd12377dbabc08076adca9c07/app/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/android/wallet/CreateWalletFragmentDialog.kt#L45

will 12-words wallets be restorable in the future version? (Like the one Erg tipping bot creates.)


[07/13/2021 7:57 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I don't know how the keys are derived on this 12 word wallets and if appkit can handle that - @morphic do you know about this?


[07/13/2021 12:32 PM] morphic#4133
No, I have no idea what tipping bot is doing. But for Appkit the mnemonic is just a String, so any string should work.


[07/13/2021 12:39 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yep, that will work but based on what derivation is used the wrong address will get calculated. as far as I know the tipbot uses the same derivation as yoroi when you restore a 12 word mnemonic. I will try eip3 and old derivation way against yoroi and see if the same address is generated

[07/20/2021 9:59 PM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
I restored one of my Yoroi wallets, and it only restored one wallet address from the mnemonic phrase (the first address I used to receive funds). 
So it only restored a fraction of the Erg that wallet holds in Yoroi.
Feature? Bug? Or am I just doing something wrong?


[07/20/2021 10:46 PM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
Just did the same thing with my other Erg wallet, restored only the first address I used to receive funds in Yoroi.


[07/20/2021 11:10 PM] morphic#4133
@MrStahlfelge ^


[07/21/2021 6:53 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Missing feature. At the moment, only the first address is available. Deriving more addresses from the same key is on the to do list.
Speaking about the topic, I am not sure which UI approach is better: the other wallet addresses could be displayed the same way your current address is displayed, or all wallet addresses could be listed under a single wallet. Both approaches have ups and downs and which one is better probably depends on how the derived addresses are used and how many are used.


[07/21/2021 8:41 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
How many derived addresses do you use? Do you use more than one wallet with derived addresses? Do you need to send ERG in a single transaction from many of your addresses?


[07/21/2021 10:23 AM] glasgowm#9381
I think keeping it simple and bundling under one is probably best. But the ability to send from a derived address would be handy. I don't use them much in yoroi because you can only receive to them and can't control when erg comes out of it. But it'd be good for making 'pots' you could ear-mark funds for.


[07/21/2021 10:38 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Ironically, simple in terms of implementation effort and UI design is the other way around. There just had to be added a derivation index to the database and a way to derive more addresses from an existing wallet, done. The main downsides here: it could get clunky when a lot of addresses are used, and sending from many addresses in a single transaction is not possible (so opposite problem of what Yoroi does).
For bundling the derived addresses in a single wallet, send screen and receive screen has to be changed in a way the derived addresses can be used. For making pots, a very good use case for the derived addresses, a way to name the derived addresses need to be added as well. and the logic that calculates the overall wallet balance need to be changed. and where to show the balances of the single addresses?


[07/21/2021 12:00 PM] morphic#4133
A user can touch the wallet icon (next to the balance) and move to the wallet details screen where the list of pots is shown. For each pot: - name; - balance; - address (partially) and copy icon; - recieve/send buttons


[07/21/2021 12:02 PM] morphic#4133
And "default" pot can be created automatically when the wallet is created.


[07/21/2021 12:03 PM] morphic#4133
The existing Receive/Send buttons can be either removed, or work with the default pot.


[07/21/2021 1:50 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
like the idea, the existing buttons should stay for users only using the primary address. About the naming, we sayed "pot" here but correct terminology is "address", isn't it?

I am open for better words, but as far as I have seen "wallet" (= a mnemonic) and "adresses" (many related to a wallet) is what most wallet applications do?


[07/22/2021 10:51 AM] glasgowm#9381
I guess it depends on the chain but I don't think many know the difference


[07/22/2021 10:53 AM] glasgowm#9381
I'd still list it as an address, but I think some branding like 'make a savings pot' would make it more tangible for people.

[07/28/2021 11:29 AM] morphic#4133
@MrStahlfelge why "there is no way to use PUSH notifications"?


[07/28/2021 11:33 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
a push notification is pushed from a server to Google's and Apple's background services and wakes up a device immediately or near time. to use this, there has to be the following done:
* register a end-user device with a token and corresponding PK addresses at a backend server
* server needs to watch the addresses and trigger a request to Apple/Google by giving the device token
* Apple/Google push to end user device

This is probably not what we want, it is the opposite of decentralization. So instead of getting a push, end user device have to pull information regularly. Main downside is that information won't come in immediately, as continuous requests would drain device battery.


[07/28/2021 11:37 AM] morphic#4133
ah, agree


[07/29/2021 1:59 PM] IPS-DeFi-State-Of-Mind#1223
So when I'm using read only wallet, it only shows the erg I've got received at that specific receive address ( I've had yoroi create a few so far)  and when I put in my actual wallet address it show 0.  Is the answer to this to just recover the wallet instead of read only? 

Great app and wallet by the way, super smooth and didn't give me any API errors like Yoroi has


[07/29/2021 2:15 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Thanks!
For read only wallets, it can only display exactly this address. So if you have other derived addresses, add them as a seperate read-only wallet.
For restoring, the app actually can only handle the first address. Enhancement to support derived addresses is suggested here: https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/ergo-wallet-android/issues/10

Hi MR Stahlfelge. I love your new android wallet and have left you a five star review. However when I try to send ERG I get an error message saying not enough funds . There are 37.3743 ergs in wallet but error says found only 22155815756. Please advise how to fix this. Thanks again for a wonderful wallet.


[08/04/2021 11:06 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
someone had this problem before and it worked after waiting some time. but instead of waiting, I would send the amount in two chunks - most likely the amount is saved in a lot of small amounts so that the list of boxes is too big to issue.


[08/05/2021 8:50 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
We have a new release 1.1.2111
Changes: 
* Can restore 12 word mnemonics (add your Telegram tip bot wallets)
* P2SH and P2S payments supported

* Suppresses screen grabbing on creating new wallets
* Node URL configurable

Download from https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/ergo-wallet-android/releases/tag/v1.1.2111 or by joining the Open Beta on Google Play. Rollout to stable channel in around 10 days

Has anyone experienced problems using the ERGO Android wallet with ERGO Auction House?


[08/15/2021 2:21 AM] Chaos Pixie#4033
Says the address I am trying to send a bid too is not a P2PK address

you need to use version 1.1 - that version is now in rollout to all users


[08/16/2021 1:12 PM] IPS-DeFi-State-Of-Mind#1223
Btw I get the same issue others are having.  When I put in my seed phrase it throws me a completely new address.  0.00 ERg in. I made no typos and entered all correctly.  Loads in Yoroi.


[08/16/2021 2:44 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
with version 1.1?


[08/17/2021 7:01 PM] IPS-DeFi-State-Of-Mind#1223
This is with the current app store version. Have not tried the new release outside of app store


[08/17/2021 7:01 PM] IPS-DeFi-State-Of-Mind#1223
Does 1.1 address this and the multiple address issue? @MrStahlfelge


[08/17/2021 8:27 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
1.1 verifies that you have no typos in mnemonic


[08/17/2021 8:42 PM] IPS-DeFi-State-Of-Mind#1223
Mnemonic was entered correctly, entered the same one on a different browser and it loaded right into Yoroi.

Maybe the issue is my wallet has balance on multiple receiving addresses


[08/17/2021 8:43 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
That's an explanation for the balance, but the first address should be the same


[08/18/2021 5:34 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042

Hey @MrStahlfelge, do you consider to derivate addresses from an extended public key in your wallet's read-only mode?


[08/19/2021 6:36 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I've read your suggestion. Most users aren't very aware of the keys and only know their mnemonic. I am not sure if yoroi can export the key


[08/19/2021 6:48 PM] anon_br#2282
It does! Just go on Yoroi's settings > wallet and export button. I'll also provide one on the paper wallet. So, it would be great if the android wallet could work together with the paper one (and yoroi) by reading this key.

@MrStahlfelge is there a way to reset your wallet send password.... its not working with what i had listed for the password


[08/23/2021 3:59 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yes, there is indeed a tweak: restore the wallet again by tapping add new wallet (the + icon) and enter the mnemonic again. You'll be asked again how you want to secure the secrets, so you can enter a new password and it will change whatever it was before.

Hey guys, quick question  on the android wallet. When I send ERG to an address does the wallet automatically add the network fee onto of the sent amount? Or does it subtract it from the amount I typed to send?


[09/03/2021 7:07 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
it is added, you can see that the amount next to the send button is higher than what you entered


[09/03/2021 7:08 PM] silencedgummy#7401
Mmm that is odd as I tried to participate in an Ergo raffle and I needed to send 4.003 ERG to the address, but everything only 4.0029 arrived there, causing it to be rejected for the raffle as it wasn't the full amount and got sent back to me minus network fees.


[09/03/2021 7:09 PM] silencedgummy#7401
So I figured oh maybe the wallet does not add network fees ontop


[09/03/2021 7:12 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
no it is added

do you have the tx id?


[09/03/2021 7:16 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
got it by pm - yeah I can understand that you suspected it being substracted, but it is not. this is the transaction on testnet I made with the screenshot above https://testnet.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/44eb40cce9d0581528e0f5efe7d6c32d69f310768993ab9805b768dc72316387


[09/03/2021 7:17 PM] silencedgummy#7401
Then I don't know why it would only send 4.0029 I'm like 100% sure I typed 4.003 not 4.0029. And I tried it twice


[09/03/2021 7:18 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I have an idea wait


[09/03/2021 7:21 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
okay you are right. the current released version has an issue with exactly this amount


[09/03/2021 7:23 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I am sorry that it hit you. the reason why I could make this successfully is that I made a change to the wallet to improve rounding issues... yesterday


[09/03/2021 7:24 PM] silencedgummy#7401
No harm done, problem is just my entries i  Ergo raffles get rejected. Also Ergnomes series 1 is dropping later so not sure if I can get in on that


[09/03/2021 7:24 PM] silencedgummy#7401
Would it fix it if I send 0.001 ERG more?


[09/03/2021 7:25 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I am not sure how the rounding will be affected, it could happen that it sends 4.004 then and I don't know how raffles react on that. I used the wallet a lot and I never had the rounding issue, the reason I made the change is that I suspected it could sometimes happen. you've found the exact amount to make it happen


[09/03/2021 7:26 PM] silencedgummy#7401

[09/03/2021 8:21 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
what you've wrote some moments ago (only taking 4 decimals into account) is intended behaviour


[09/03/2021 8:29 PM] EddNorris | FishFight.app DEV#1111
So our ERGnomes store will not work on the Ergo wallet, because we currently use the 4-6 decimal places for unique ids for handling sales?

Floating-point error mitigation, because 100000.29037895793 would produce floating point errors (probably) I've decided to cap the decimals that wouldn't be needed at the current price


[09/04/2021 3:29 AM] CypherPet#3447
I've been testing the wallet, here's a few possible upgrade suggestions:
1-On the main screen, it feels like there should be a "copy address" function. Sending assets between wallets would be smoother.  Maybe tapping the wallet symbol on the left could do it?

2-When sending assets, the balance is hidden behind my keyboard (image), maybe sticking the box to the top instead of it being centered could help for UX. 

3-I don't know if the "value" is stored in the QR code when sending the "request payment" image but scanning the QR code should autofill the "amount" to transfer. Only address is transfered. This could be great for interacting with the Minting/Auction House contract. A single QR code creating the transaction to send the ASSET+ERGS to the contract address could be quite simple and friendly for the users.

Hi, thanks for your input :-)
3. is already supported. It should fill the amount input when the qr codes contains it. Tokens are also supported, but I haven't seen an application using this yet.
1. is a good idea, for now you can go over receive (I know, it is one tap more)
2. This bothers me as well, but I've tried with many different layouts and having the amount at the top was never satisfying so I settled with this one.

[09/04/2021 4:17 PM] CypherPet#3447
For 3 I was thinking about the auction house. To set the auction you have to send the token you want to auction and X amount of ergs to the contract, same address for both. I was thinking this could be done in a single transaction, but I'm not sure the auction house supports it yet.. this could be a nice upgrade because sometimes it takes a few minutes for each transaction to process. üî•


[09/04/2021 4:27 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Oh, don't know about having a single transaction, auction house is @anon_real 's estate. As said, reading a token from a qr is already supported by the wallet app, as soon as for example auction house integrates it it will work.


[09/04/2021 4:49 PM] CypherPet#3447
Dapp connector for browser transaction and qr code for mobile ones would be great for the users.  it's nice to see the progress that's been done on the last few weeks ü•∞

it does it that way, if you have many boxes you need to scan many qr codes üòÑ


[10/23/2021 2:02 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
there are different definitions of safety. the safety you describe makes sure you don't loose access. other people are more concerned that others could get access, and spreading to many devices is of course more risk for that.


[10/23/2021 2:03 PM] timoh#9775
yeah I dont have that much ergo to worry someone stealing it
it is more of backup lesson, to have multiple access -> if it were more valuable, I woudlnt want some usb stick get lost or paper eaten by dog, and thus loose access

I think for ERG the biggest problem is social engineering attack and no malware attacking the wallets at the moment anyway. but that might change.


[10/23/2021 2:05 PM] timoh#9775
biggest looks to be that exchange is hacked and lots of ergo or other coin stolen with master keys.... ofc if someone knows your address and how much you have, they might do social engineering "attack" to gather enough info and try access your wallet
For a cold wallet that should be very hard to do tho, when followed instructions


[10/23/2021 2:08 PM] timoh#9775
ERGO until now has been relatively small platform so biggest hurdle was ease of use with wallets


[10/23/2021 2:08 PM] nitram147#5106
Ok, that sound great. CSR - means cold wallet sign request? ü§î  Have you thought about using something like CBOR instead of json, or some other type with better compression. For example europe use this https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/default/files/ehealth/docs/digital-green-certificates_v3_en.pdf for issuance of QR codes containing QR codes with proofs of covid vaccination


[10/23/2021 2:09 PM] nitram147#5106
It could decrease the size of QR codes which will improve the speed of scanning them - and also they can be scanned from bigger distance or with more blurry camera


[10/23/2021 2:10 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
the content held in the json, the reducedtransaction and inputboxes, are already compressed. it is just the outer hull that is using json and don't really add up


[10/23/2021 10:13 PM] nitram147#5106
Which algorithm is used for compression?


[10/23/2021 10:15 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
As far as I know no compressing algorithm, it is compressed in terms of being binary packed. @morphic can probably tell more about the serialization code


[10/23/2021 11:36 PM] nitram147#5106
the cryptographic signature cannot be compressed of course (because of entropy theory), however all additional data which are included around could be compressed


[10/23/2021 11:38 PM] nitram147#5106
then it's about how big part (percentage) of the signed transactional data is made of signature/user_address/etc and what part is made by column_names etc.


[10/23/2021 11:39 PM] nitram147#5106
also if the serialized value is in some base64 or other encoding, it's wasting space, because if it would be in pure binary bytes it would consume less space...


[10/24/2021 7:59 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
True but base64 is due to qr code encoding. It's 2900 chars available but only when using 7 bit. Using binary data it is less available so nothing gained. A simple tx has around 400 chars. I got pages only for tx with lots of boxes, and only when sending the input box information. This is needed only towards the cold device, the signed tx only contains the box IDs and therefore is much smaller.
If you are interested best is to check it out, you can check the qr code payload with the camera app or if no device present in emulator with the debugger.


[10/24/2021 11:30 AM] morphic#4133
Yes, the serialised bytes of ReducedTransaction can be compressed, for example when there are many input boxes with the same P2PK address.


[10/26/2021 9:07 PM] FlyingPig#2854
Would it be possible to have a setting in the android wallet that makes the Token the primary display unit?
I've got a few wallets that I will be using where the # of tokens is the primary purpose. They will only contain a fraction of an ERG in order to facilate transactions between said wallets. The users of the wallets won't need to see the ERG at all (meybe in TINY font).


[10/26/2021 9:17 PM] FlyingPig#2854

@MrStahlfelge Recently trying to redeem some sigmaUSD back to Erg, since Android wallet couldn't input 0 Erg amount (solely sending sigmaUSD with calculated fee), I manually input some small numbers which results only failures, all the time...

Maybe the smart contract was expecting a specific value of Erg, with manual input Erg amount it breaks itself. I don't know...

Does UTXO really need to contain greater than zero amount of ERG? ü§î


[11/08/2021 8:42 PM] nitram147#5106
(I'm not talking about paying the fee for transaction. But I would be quite surprised if all of the newly created UTXOs by transactions has to contain non-zero ERG amount)


[11/08/2021 9:47 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
more of a general discussion - I don't know if an empty box would make any sense


[11/09/2021 4:13 PM] nitram147#5106

Also I did experienced a problem like 3-4 hours ago, on the testnet version - application told that transaction was send and also showed transaction id, however testnet explorer mempool seems to be empty. But in new block transactiob was mined


[11/09/2021 4:16 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yeah I also have it blocked on some connections, whyever that is made. you can set the node to connect to in the settings


[11/09/2021 4:16 PM] nitram147#5106

[11/09/2021 4:17 PM] nitram147#5106
I don't like centralized solutions, however it could be good to make  a community relay to relay transaction to some full node, which would listen on 443 or 80, so it would be accessible even in restricted connections


[11/09/2021 4:19 PM] nitram147#5106
Another thing - maybe it would be better to use just full node instead of explorer. There are a lot of full nodes, however only one explorer - it's then single point of failure to rely on one website


[11/09/2021 4:22 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
that's true, but in theory there could be more explorers and its API is needed. indeed, when explorer went down we had it up again within no time, and it is designe to be under pressure with load balancers. so I actually would prefer to extend its functionality. the relay to a node you recommended is something that would be good to have on explorer


[11/09/2021 4:24 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I know this is the opposite of decentralization, but it is easier to keep a single address running for the users that don't care while in theory everyone can set up an own explorer and switch to it in the apps options


[11/10/2021 2:24 AM] nitram147#5106
@MrStahlfelge Maybe if the app try to request explorer and node once in the while (after start of application and later each 30 seconds for example) it could show warning that even when there is internet connection (could be checked by sending request to google and a few more website and if sufficient amount of them work we can assume that there is internet connection available) the node or explorer is not accessible at the moment


[11/10/2021 2:25 AM] nitram147#5106
This wouldn't fix the case when testnet explorer mempool is broken as of now, however it could prevent some other cases - user will be informed that something is wrong about the connection to node/explorer, so he will be able to decide whether it wouldn't be better to use the app later or on some other internet connection...


[11/10/2021 2:26 AM] nitram147#5106
This had to be quite easy to implement, and in my humble opinion it could make user experience much better in the "stressful" situation when he couldn't use the app...


[11/10/2021 8:06 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
sure, for the explorer api it is that way already (test by using flight mode, the app will show you a broken cloud symbol when refreshing). for node connection I will try to push your suggestion with a proxy, as I am not developing the backend I need to get others do this.

In case that the app is using full node only for sending transaction to network


[11/11/2021 3:24 PM] nitram147#5106
Is there anything else that you are using full node for at the moment?


[11/11/2021 3:24 PM] nitram147#5106
In case there isn't this should be sufficient solution


[11/11/2021 3:25 PM] nitram147#5106
Otherwise we would maybe still need the proxy for the remaining operations until they get implemented into explorer

[11/11/2021 3:25 PM] nitram147#5106
Maybe there would be a great point to have also peer discovery function implemented into explorer


[11/11/2021 3:25 PM] nitram147#5106
So your app can fetch a few peers


[11/11/2021 3:26 PM] nitram147#5106
And can relay transaction via more than one full node so user can be more assured that it will be really propagated over the network

That is interesting, originally in appkit I hoped to not use explorer at all (because it is centralised component)


[11/11/2021 4:19 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yeah it is good to support both with appkit. we always have this tradeoff with centralisation. but we need it for getting users on board that want to do it the easy way. on the other hand, it is possible to roll an own explorer backend, isn't it?


[11/11/2021 5:09 PM] morphic#4133
Explorers is only used for requesting unspent boxes. The same method can be implemented by the node, and then explorer is not necessary


[11/11/2021 5:11 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yep, would be good to have both possible. can the node fetch the necessary data as quick as explorer is able to do it?


[11/11/2021 5:17 PM] morphic#4133
The full node is creating and validating blocks, but doesn't have an index for querying of boxes belonging to the given address.


[11/11/2021 5:18 PM] morphic#4133
However all the boxes are there, so only index is missing


[11/11/2021 5:18 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
it would be a cool feature to have either connect to explorer for the average user, or to an own node for users running one.


[11/11/2021 5:19 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
could be set with a switch on the context which one should be used


[11/11/2021 5:21 PM] morphic#4133
Even if implemented in Ergo Node, this is optional feature, so wallet need to be able to query node for this specific capability.


[11/11/2021 5:22 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
you mean query it to check if the feature is supported?


[11/11/2021 5:22 PM] morphic#4133
If in addition the wallet can discover nodes with indexed addresses, then explorer will be unnecessary and we will have decentralized wallet.


[11/11/2021 5:22 PM] morphic#4133
yes


[11/11/2021 5:23 PM] morphic#4133
centralized wallet is fragile


[11/11/2021 5:23 PM] morphic#4133
and doesn't have to be


[11/11/2021 5:25 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
that is possible, but we might run into the situation that users have problems that we can't reproduce or solve. the blocked port is a good example, I can't send transactions on my work place but can fetch balance because that works over http(s). So probably to reduce problems, it comes down to such nodes support http requests as an option. I don't know how complicated it is to set up explorer backend, maybe decentralizing the explorer is the easier way?


[11/11/2021 5:29 PM] morphic#4133
The connectivity problem can be solved by special API method, this can be probed to test connectivity. The method just responds with the original request, which means the connection is good.


[11/11/2021 5:30 PM] morphic#4133
the wallet tests the connection during discovery of nodes to work with.


[11/11/2021 5:39 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Yeah, that is feasible.
What is with other Apis like token information?


[11/11/2021 7:20 PM] morphic#4133
yeah, that is harder üôÇ


[11/11/2021 11:50 PM] nitram147#5106
The best way would be if there will be some way for peer discovery. There are lot of decentralized (not only cryptocurrency) projects which use various techniques to achieve this. For example we can have hardcoded list of 10 full nodes, also have dynamic peer discovery via 2 or more domains which are independent on each other. Than the wallet workflow will be as follows:
1.) Try to connect to the last discovered peers (this step will be done if wallet was already connected to some peers in the past, if the wallet is clean install, we can jump to the step no.2 and store discovered peers for future)
2.) If step 1 failed or wallet is opened for the first time, try to connect to peers obtained from peer discovery domains (randomly choose which domain to balance traffic)
3.) If step 2 failed, try to connect to one from the hardcoded list of full nodes, if successful ask full node for other peers (there should be already existing api endpoint for that)
Once we had a few (more than one) working full nodes, we can proceed to randomly selecting one from them and use it for current wallet session.
In case that all previous attempts failed, we can switch to use explorer (or multiple explorers). This can be useful in the case of restricted internet access (port blocking), but shouldn't be done by default. Everything should be tried before switching to this backup way.

[11/12/2021 7:08 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Yes, that would work. I just want to throw in that on mobile, this could also lead to things getting really slow when a user has an unreliable connection. There is no way to decide if a connection can't get made because the other side does not exist or because we just have a network hickup because user's GSM connection just dropped. So the search for a connectable node might get confused when on mobile.


[11/12/2021 7:09 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Can you send me a screenshot of the code


[11/12/2021 8:37 AM] nitram147#5106
This could be user selectable. With opt-out option for using just explorer. By default it would show bootstrapping proccess with progressbar, and maybe ask if it detects that it's on mobile data and connection is unreliable (ping known websites such as google) whether to switch to more centralized way.


[11/12/2021 8:38 AM] nitram147#5106
If there would be a lot of adoption, it isn't wise to point all the people to one specific website.


[11/12/2021 8:38 AM] nitram147#5106
Better way would be to maxime decentralization and stability


[11/12/2021 8:40 AM] nitram147#5106
I remeber that year ago like in 2016, when I was using bitcoin electrum wallet it took a while to synchronize, it was SPV wallet but it uses full nodes to fetch transactions info via bloomfilter technique. At least I remember that it was done that way.


[11/12/2021 8:40 AM] nitram147#5106
I don't even know whether we have something like bloom filter feature in ergo


[11/12/2021 8:41 AM] nitram147#5106
Maybe @kushti could answer


[11/12/2021 8:42 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I hope the nipopows will give us something here, too. my personal concern is not an unreliable server - dimitry makes a good job in holding the server reliable, and there are already load balancers in place -, but instead that it is a trusted connection.


[11/12/2021 8:48 AM] nitram147#5106
It could always be censored even in case that dimitry keep doing good job. It's true that even connection to full nodes could be defaultly censor (until we develop something like ssl tunnel for nodes communication). In my opinion when user see a progressbar he would be calm and willing to wait for bootstrap process. See how it's done in the tor browser mobile (UI of that process).


[11/12/2021 8:49 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
okay, if censor is the concern, I can understand that. Unfortunately, censoring is the default on mobile platforms. On iOS, there is no way to use an uncensored app. On Android, users can sideload but 95% don't do it.


[11/12/2021 8:50 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
that means, if you live in a country where access to explorer is blocked, it is most likely you can't install the app anyway


[11/12/2021 8:51 AM] nitram147#5106
NIPoPoW could help with trustless validation. Something like bloom filter is useful to hide your address from full nodes. So fullnodes don't know which address balance you are asking. For example it would be like send me balances for addresses starting with 9abc, of course in reality it's a bit more complex. In current scenario if somebody intercept traffic to full node (your ISP), the spy could know your addresses. That a bit protected if you use explorer for fetching of balance (cause it's TLS encrypted), however still the explorer owner could associate your ip with addresses.


[11/12/2021 8:52 AM] nitram147#5106
In android you can install it as standalone apk and tunnel your traffic via vpn. It's being done by a lot of people. If you have iOS you are unlucky, I don't like such a closed one platforms.

Hi, I wanted to ask a query as I have tried to restore my Yoroi wallet in Android Wallet but when I put in the words it shows ANOTHER wallet number, not my usual one. Is there something I am doing wrong? Is there anything else I should do?


[11/12/2021 1:48 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yoroi can use many addresses, it shows them in the receive tab. Android restores the first as default, to use the other ones go to wallet settings -> addresses


[11/12/2021 1:50 PM] ERGkleure#7076
I understand. I have only 1 address, I have no more and the default one of mine is not the one the app was showing me.


[11/12/2021 1:52 PM] ERGkleure#7076
In the read-only wallet function it did fine, but in the other restore option it did not.


[11/12/2021 2:05 PM] ERGkleure#7076
I just tried it again and the same thing happens to me. With my words it restores a wallet that is not mine. Nor is it my number and also the balance is 0.


[11/12/2021 2:10 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
does the android wallet give you a warning that your seed phrase seems invalid when you restore it?


[11/12/2021 2:15 PM] ERGkleure#7076
Below it says that the Mnemonic validation has failed. If you are sure it has been entered correctly, you can tap again to continue.

Mobile Ergo wallet should ultimately be unstopable. So all the censorship resistance and connectivity techniques should be considered and adopted over time.


[11/12/2021 5:04 PM] morphic#4133
One interesting tech to consider is libp2p


[11/12/2021 5:04 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
that is feasible for android. on ios only when apple ultimately is forced to allow sideloading

you can only install via app store, no sideloading possible.

Ah, I didn't mean this kind of censorship. I mean in some countries internet is partially blocked (like in Russia). In this case VPN is often the acceptable workaround. In China the firewall is more total and not every VPN is available. Then a dynamic discovery may be necessary.

But, this is about future. The minimum requirements is that the wallet can at least survive when individual explorer or node disappears.


[11/12/2021 5:13 PM] morphic#4133
As the next step, the wallet can discover more than one alternative connections and select the best one of them and reconnect if necessary.


[11/12/2021 5:16 PM] morphic#4133
So, basically, connectivity component of the wallet is a subsystem which can become more and more sophisticated over time. And it is good if can abstract this under well defined interfaces early on, and isolate this complexity from the rest of the application logic.

@MrStahlfelge Wouldn't be better to introduce some additional step with transaction recapitulation before really sending out funds? That user will see full recipient address (not only it's part in the input dialog) and amount of erg. Many banking apps do it like this and I'm use to this intermediate step of verification that everything was entered correctly. Especially in cryptocurrency platforms where transaction cannot be reversed (canceled) this should be required. "Measure twice, cut once" üôÇ

Technically no problem, not sure if it is needed since it just repeats the information. I'll think some more about it

It's always better to double check than to facepalm later when funds went to the bad address.

I check your code. 
you use Gson to work with json.
Gson has default value of setting htmlSafe=true. 
this is used when you want to display json string in html or use it for url query.
but in binary qrcode you can use all ISO 8859-1 characters.

A QR code (an initialism for Quick Response code) is a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode) invented in 1994 by the Japanese automotive company Denso Wave.

```    public ReducedTransaction parseReducedTransaction(byte[] txBytes) {
        SigmaByteReader r = SigmaSerializer$.MODULE$.startReader(txBytes, 0);

java.nio.BufferUnderflowException

maybe there is an incompatibility between JS and appkit implementations of ReducedTransaction. @morphic and @greenhat may shed some light here


[11/23/2021 9:06 AM] minotaur#0852
the only different between these two implementation is transaction cost. sigma-rust does not implement transaction cost but appkit implement it. 
@morphic can it cause this error?


[11/23/2021 9:07 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
FWIW, I have added to improve error handling to issue #58 so user gets a message


[11/23/2021 9:08 AM] greenhat#6562
That's weird. I did serialization in sigma-rust exactly as it's done in Scala.


[11/23/2021 9:09 AM] minotaur#0852
I check serialization in both packages. the only different is sigma-rust set cost to zero


[11/23/2021 9:17 AM] greenhat#6562
@MrStahlfelge wait, why do you read cost after parsing the tx? I did not write it after the tx.

don't use it later, it is read at the marked line above when parsing

[11/23/2021 9:31 AM] greenhat#6562
I'm pretty sure buffer underflow exception is caused by missing cost after the tx. How should we fix this? Seems like the tx cost is not strictly needed and could be summed from reduced inputs.


[11/23/2021 9:33 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
is the field missing? what about just giving 0?


[11/23/2021 9:36 AM] greenhat#6562
Yep, there is no cost written after the tx on sigma-rust side (according to eip-19).


[11/23/2021 9:41 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
ah okay, since it is the last field it could be omitted and we could use a default value. I am not opinionated if we should change parsing in appkit or serializing in rust, which one is better should be decided by you two (morphic and greenhat)


[11/23/2021 10:57 AM] morphic#4133
@MrStahlfelge @greenhat Yes, it seems the root cause of exception is missing cost in the bytes. The cost is not necessary now, but may be useful in future to have an estimation tx cost before sending it. This may by useful once there will be some pool prioritisation in future based on txCost/txFee ratio. 
So, maybe we should extend EIP with the cost field, and also update sigma-rust serializer.

Finally getting around to this.
How would I go about restoring my wallet? Deleting it?


[12/16/2021 7:24 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
No need to, just go to new wallet, restore and enter the mnemonic


[12/16/2021 10:29 AM] nitram147#5106
Is there any reason why to have separate testnet wallet? There could be option hidden in the settings available to add testnet wallet. So with the same app it would be possible to have:
1.) Mainnet only (default)
2.) Testnet only
3.) Both mainnet and testnet
This way testnet version of app doesn't have to be installed from github & it would be consuming less space in the phone (no redundant code app twice times)


[12/16/2021 10:29 AM] nitram147#5106
I know that testnet is used only mainly by the developers however I think this could make better UX


[12/16/2021 10:30 AM] nitram147#5106
Even normal users could try ergo on "dry run" with testnet before using it with real money on mainnet


[12/16/2021 10:31 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
short reason, it is a lot more effort that is not justifiable as the general interest in testnet is pretty low. additionally, testnet is often buggy or does not work so having it in the official product will only lead to support cases

{Reactions}

[12/16/2021 10:38 AM] nitram147#5106
Right know it isn't demanded but I can imagine that each dApp could have it's testnet version so people could try it without real money so they will get used to it and then move to mainnet. It would  probably help many people avoid errors which are quite expensive - when we imagine ergo's target "ordinary human" user without technical knowledge and ergo blockchain experience. Of course this update would be low priority and it could be hidden somewhere in settings under "advance user or development mode" same way as are android developers settings hidden inside of setting app. Last argument with testnet instability is correct - it's a shame. I've been showing beta version of sigmastamp dApp to my non-blockchain friend on testnet and the experience was thank's to the testnet horrible. She asked me whether somebody could trust with their money to such an unstable system. Same way for testnet fullnode synchronization. The developer onboarding experience on testnet is also bad than to before mentioned reasons. I know it's not your fault, I'm just agree with your argument üôÇ


[12/16/2021 10:40 AM] nitram147#5106
This update shouldn't be a lot of work (correct me if I'm wrong, I haven't read your code base and don't know how you designed the workflow...), even user who could try to send money between two phones with testnet could try how just basic transactions work so they will be more brave to use it on mainnet <-- this is future update when we onboard new "ordinary" people.


[12/16/2021 10:45 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I agree what you've said about the testnet and that every dapp should have a testnet version. That's not the case now, another reason why testnet is pretty unimportant. I can assure you I will continue to support testnet with all my work. üôÇ

Unfortunately, it is not as easy as you think. At the moment, testnet/mainnet is a global variable set on app start. this could be changed by adding a param to all accessing methods and adding a db column to the wallet config if it is testnet and mainnet, a switch would be needed for wallet creation and restore which might confuse users... I just don't think it is worth it, at least at this point of time, and most devices should have 25 mb of free storage. üôÇ

I gave it a thought again because of ios as there is no way to sideload, but I dropped a testnet release on ios because of the mentioned reasons as well. (but testnet is supported when you compilie your own ios version)


[12/16/2021 3:08 PM] t.gig#9675
Got it! That worked, thanks!
I have a couple of requests. Shall I post them here or where is best for you?


[12/16/2021 3:24 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
If you think it is something to discuss here is good. You can also open an issue on GitHub after checking if there's already one open


[12/16/2021 11:13 PM] t.gig#9675
Ok thanks! I don‚Äôt see any of these featured on GitHub:

Global Biometric Lock 
Must use Face/Touch ID to open app if enabled

‚ÄúShow‚Äù Password
Have an eye logo so we can see what we type in the password field 

2FA
Consider optional 2FA when restoring a wallet or withdrawing funds  

Text Suggestions
Not from a seed database or anything, just the generic iOS suggestion box when typing. It‚Äôs great that the app can tell if you misspell a seed but the suggestions will make it even faster!

Lock Orientation
Ability to lock or disable landscape orientation


[12/17/2021 9:01 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Thanks for the input!
1. not present yet, correct, you can add an issue
2. not present as well, but has security implications obviously, you can add an issue
3. the wallet already is 2FA. First factor is access to the device that holds the secrets, second factor is either knowledge of password you've given or biometric authentification
4. this has massive security implications. It means to disable security features for the text field. The keyboard might save the given phrase, suggest  it in other applications etc
5. not present, but I am curious: when you don't like rotation, why don't you disable it system-wide?


[12/20/2021 9:48 AM] Strupf#5194

[12/22/2021 11:54 PM] enakki#3288
I appreciate all the work and effort, but I'm finding lack of this feature quite serious for v 1.0 .. don't get me wrong but this may be confusing for many people trying to use the wallet. I personally use to use "new address" feature pretty often (on Cardano too) and from my perspective the wallet as a product is incomplete from the functional perspective. Again, nothing wrong with that, just v.1.0 may be confusing as many may expect full-feature product.. Any idea when the address management can be implemented? Anyway, thanks for the wallet app. I'm trying to test it.

Hello, just to give a feedback, either I am missing something or the wallet doesn't have a whitelist feature, and honestly I think that is one of the most simple yet one of the best UX feature, maybe something for the future? :thonk:


[12/30/2021 3:33 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
What do you want to whitelist?


[12/30/2021 5:17 PM] Hamilton#4703
List of address, do we have that? And I'm being really dumb and not seeing lol


[12/30/2021 5:19 PM] Hamilton#4703
One thing that I think everyone has experienced when moving crypto around is the "stress" that comes with sending stuff to a new address, so usually, what I do on exchanges and wallets, is to add addresses to a whitelist and of course, the first time I use it, I send a test transaction, but after that, I know that I don't need to check that address again


[12/30/2021 5:21 PM] Hamilton#4703
It is there, saved on the application and I just have to select that, based on wtv name I put, like "MrStahlfelge's wallet", so I don't have to check the address again


[12/30/2021 5:21 PM] Hamilton#4703
Exchanges call it a whitelist, but it is more like a contact list or address list


[12/30/2021 5:44 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042

@MrStahlfelge is there any chance ergo wallet gets some biometric/pin requirements for logging in . Right now you can just open the app and see everything; also it would be nice to be able to rearrange wallets manually on my home screen

You can rearrange by renaming, sorting is alphabetically.

Many exchanges and even crypto wallets have this feature. Reasoning could be as simple as, that you unlock your phone and open youtube video and then give this phone to your child/nephew/whoever. You trust the person you are giving your phone but however unprobable, he could accidently open the exchange and for example close some trade by randomly clicking... If the person you gave the phone is older he can even see the amount of money located in the wallet...


[01/01/2022 4:36 PM] nitram147#5106
Most of crypt exchanges, cryptowallets and even internet banking apps have this feature


[01/01/2022 4:42 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
As said feel free to add the issue. It was requested in the past as well, it is just my personal opinion that it's not really needed and I hate apps enforcing it. I would not hand out my phone without screen pinning but others might be less restrictive.
But to be precise, there's no way in signing trades with the current version, only information publicly available can be seen.


[01/01/2022 4:56 PM] nitram147#5106
If I'm right there android api for doing this, so it will request you to place your finger on the fingerprint sensor or to enter the security pattern


[01/01/2022 4:57 PM] nitram147#5106
Option could be by default deactivated and there would be voluntary activation of this feature in the settings


[01/01/2022 4:57 PM] nitram147#5106
But from my point of view there are much more important features to be implemented than this one üôÇ


[01/01/2022 5:01 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
That's already used for storing the secrets.
Indeed there's no real API to secure the app itself. It's always a kind of a hack with overlaying stuff on app resume callback. you can notice that with the usual banking apps. When you switch back to the app you can see the old screen flickering and then the login screen appearing shortly after. Anyway if users want the feature I am not opposing it

Hi, I just had a quick question about the Android wallet. I sent Ergo from kucoin to my wallet 15hrs ago and it came in the wallet as "unconfirmed" (which has been normal for all my other transactions) but stayed like that for 8hrs then now has gone away without the ergo actually entering the wallet. Does this sometimes take a long time or could I have done something wrong? (I have sent to this wallet quite a number of times no issue) thanks for any help or advice.

in the Ergo android wallet I noticed that if your transaction fails for lack of sufficient balance, you have to leave the app and come back again to try making a transaction with the correct balance. Just staying with the app open and changing the inputs to a correct balance isn't enough

A couple of general questions.

1. If someone had my seed phrase, would they also need my spending password to restore my wallet.

2. Is there an option within the app to change spending password?

I should add that I have no reason to suspect anyone has either, I‚Äôm just curious.

Thanks in advance


[01/13/2022 3:18 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
You only need the seed phrase to restore the wallet. To change the spending password, restore the wallet with your seed phrase and save it by using the new spending password.

First impressions about receiving and sending funds from ergo wallet.  
Receiving funds from Kucoin exchange is smooth and overall pretty fast. However I don't understand the fields ''Amount'' and ''Purpose''. It's confusing because I thought at first I had to complete the fields to receive funds. Sending funds is pretty simple as well and the spending password works well with password vault. However, I had a strange feeling when sending 1 Erg I saw all of my funds were ''unconfirmed''. I guess it has something to do with EUTXO but on the end user side, it's a little bit frightening at first.  All in all it's a great wallet and I look forward using it to buy nfts!


[01/14/2022 6:12 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042

So there's the Sigma Valley metaverse auction going on. I've been trying to connect my Yoroi wallet (it requires yoroi extension + dapp connector). The dapp connector seems non existent in the extension app store. Either way, I was finally able to bid by sending a min bid amount to the address mentioned in the auction details. The transaction did go through, and it is in the confirmation phase. I'm starting to worry that  Yoroi might not support NFT's. Is this the case? I might have just wasted some ERG

Or am I jumping the gun and this is still in development??

New features added to Ergo Wallet Android
Benjamin Schulte talks us through the new features of Ergo Wallet Android 1.4, which is now released on GitHub and Google Play Beta. An important new feature is the cold wallet functionality which is a valid alternative to hardware wallets. Because it is not obvious how this works, he has prepared a demonstration video for this feature for easie...

Thank you!


[01/16/2022 4:27 PM] blackinsecure#3693
In the PT telegram group there is a guy insisting he's trying to recover his wallet created with yoroi on the Ergo Wallet but when he does it shows a zero balance. Is that even possible?


[01/16/2022 4:28 PM] blackinsecure#3693
and by that I mean theoretically having a balance but it not being shown after recovery


[01/16/2022 4:30 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
the app only sets up the main address automatically. yoroi uses a phletora of derived addresses without people even noticing. his funds will be stored on one of the other addresses. he can derive them on the wallet settings -> addresses


[01/16/2022 4:33 PM] blackinsecure#3693
thank you very much. I'm gonna spread that word


[01/16/2022 4:47 PM] blackinsecure#3693
but will this function add a new address or recover the ones already created by Yoroi?


[01/16/2022 5:05 PM] blackinsecure#3693
Also I just saw an update on the app store mentioning Spanish support but I couldn't find an option to change language settings, just currency


[01/16/2022 5:06 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
when your ios is set to Spanish, the app will show Spanish


[01/16/2022 5:06 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yes it will recover the same addresses


[01/16/2022 5:07 PM] blackinsecure#3693
Android here, same thing?


[01/16/2022 5:07 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yes


[01/16/2022 5:07 PM] blackinsecure#3693
hmmmm

are these the only two languages?

I can help with PT support as I've been doing with the website

and my French and my Arabic are not good enough just yet, so I'll let other people help you with those


[01/16/2022 5:08 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
PT = portugese?
app is in spanish, chinese and english right now


[01/16/2022 5:09 PM] blackinsecure#3693
yes, Portuguese


[01/16/2022 5:09 PM] blackinsecure#3693
Especially Brazilian Portuguese, but I can make more neutral translations for my friends from Portugal and Angola and other places

If a derived address has been deleted what is the best way to add it back? I think I may have had something sent to such an address and even though I have added -200 addresses I don‚Äôt think the deleted one has been added back yet. Cheers


[01/17/2022 5:22 AM] blackinsecure#3693
I see it, thanks


[01/17/2022 5:22 AM] blackinsecure#3693
than it's done already


[01/17/2022 6:51 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Best is to double check if your mnemonic was right? Did you get any earnings when entering it?


[01/17/2022 7:10 AM] jjd#0470
Thank you, just to clarify what do you mean by earnings? I think I removed the address after I copied it but before some transactions were sent to it although I am now double checking


[01/17/2022 7:14 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Typo, meant warnings


[01/17/2022 7:20 AM] jjd#0470
Ah got it, no warnings. Other expected transactions are there although I needed to add about 50 address for them to appear. I removed a number of the unused addresses afterwards but can‚Äôt quite remember if the address I shared was one of the ones deleted or from Yoroi.


[01/18/2022 10:38 AM] Hamilton#4703
So, is there a plan to make the wallet usable in DeFi? Just so I can get my hopes up to drop Yoroi forever :[


[01/18/2022 12:01 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042

I added 5 wallets to Android Ergo Wallet. Is there a way to rearrange the order of my added wallets?


[01/19/2022 7:00 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
They are ordered alphabetically so a trick is to use numbers as prefix

@MrStahlfelge Offtopic question - I've seen that you had proposed multiple EIPs. Is there some "standard" way to propose an EIP? What about the numbering - there a few EIP numbers skipped (when looking through all branches in eip repo). Thanks :)


[01/21/2022 9:12 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
For the skipped numbers there are already PRs open.
Standard way is open it and invite others to review on the Wednesday developer's chat

Is TestFlight iOS wallet is final which will be realised in AppStore, or you are planning to make changes?


[01/22/2022 11:59 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I do changes all the time, at the moment implementing ergo pay. So it's more a matter of when we'll get the dev account for ergo. If we would get it now, I would release the current version on the app store. If it is in two weeks, I would go with build 2203. And so on

@MrStahlfelge I‚Äôm on 1.5.2203 of the iOS wallet and my transactions are failing to send. Debug logs show a nullpointer exception. Does TestFlight send the stack trace to you, or would it be valuable if I sent it?


[01/26/2022 1:05 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Seems to be an issue with the node the wallet connects to by default. You can go to Settings -> Expert settings and give another public node


[01/26/2022 1:06 PM] Meltpool#9999
Thanks for the swift response! I‚Äôll give it a try


[01/26/2022 1:13 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
this is a list of public nodes. note that the port in the list (9030) is not to be used by the app, must stay at 9053. https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/blob/e68ce6180b13bffb024cf9e26c7c16a7be70a22c/src/main/resources/mainnet.conf#L43


[01/26/2022 1:46 PM] Meltpool#9999
I have tried a few different nodes from that list. Two were down and could not be connected to. Another four were up, but I still got the same nullpointerexception and the transaction couldn‚Äôt be done. Port remained 9053 as specified.
I‚Äôll look into this further when I‚Äôm off work tonight.

[01/26/2022 8:50 PM] shinyumbreon#2454
both of those images are the same wallet. One is restored seedphrase the other is simply a read address


[01/26/2022 8:51 PM] shinyumbreon#2454
and yes i added the read address to the seedphrase wallet address already


[01/26/2022 8:51 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
you can't have the same main address added twice, it will automatically merge to one wallet. so I assume you have a wallet with multiple addresses, and not all addresses set up


[01/26/2022 8:52 PM] shinyumbreon#2454
I only use one address though


[01/26/2022 8:52 PM] shinyumbreon#2454
mainly


[01/26/2022 8:52 PM] shinyumbreon#2454
which is that bottom account (read only)


[01/26/2022 8:53 PM] shinyumbreon#2454
the top portion is backed up seed phrase. I already added all the addresses to the seedphrase wallet


[01/26/2022 8:53 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
so the bottom one is one of the derived addresses of the upper one?


[01/26/2022 8:53 PM] shinyumbreon#2454
correct


[01/26/2022 8:54 PM] shinyumbreon#2454
and the bottom address is listed as an address on the upper one


[01/26/2022 8:55 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
please show the address list for both wallets (wallet settings -> addresses)

Hello everyone, presenting first version of SAFEW, chrome/opera extension Wallet with a dApp connector. 
Still in development for the Ergohack but the features are working for me and I'm waiting for feedbacks.
https://github.com/ThierryM1212/SAFEW/releases
To use the extension, it needs to be loaded as "unpacked extension" in your browser, enabling developer mode in the extension screen.
To use the dApp connector, for example with Ergodex, you needs also to disable Yoroi as it implements the same interface.

[02/03/2022 2:11 PM] SoCool#6419
Using the same mnemonic in Android wallet as yoroi nightly gave me, and I got a different address and it doesn't have the balance yoroi nightly has.

Is this a matter of an address derivation difference? Is it correctable? I just sent everything from yoroi nightly to the new one so it doesn't matter, but I'm curious if they are the same private key and I can do something to get them to recognize and access each other's balances.

Or, is it more likely that the private keys are different? Say I mistakenly entered a typo in the mnemonic, would it have still created a valid private key, but a different one?


[02/03/2022 2:14 PM] SoCool#6419
Having done swaps on yoroi nightly wallet, perhaps in the future some project will airdrop to its address - would be nice to have access to that address from android mobile wallet for such case


[02/03/2022 3:06 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
if you had a typo, you would have a different private key. but if you do so, there's a warning shown on restore that the mnemonic seems invalid.
most likely you used another derived address. you can derive addresses on the wallet in wallet config -> addresses. you can double check your mnemonic in wallet config, it can be displayed.


[02/03/2022 3:17 PM] SoCool#6419
Yeah, I verified the mnemonic using the display in the app as you mention, was correct, I got no warning about mnemonic seeming invalid either.

Can I specify the derivation somewhere in the wallet config -> addresses ? I just see a slider to create new derivations but I don't see where I can manually enter the derivation yoroi nightly used


[02/03/2022 3:18 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
it's an index counting on, and when you add some addresses you can tap on it and the derivation path is shown


[02/03/2022 3:44 PM] SoCool#6419
Hmm, just verified by restoring yoroi nightly and mobile again from my written mnemonic, and same behaviour.

Different address on android with blank wallet, yoroi got the previos wallet with the full transaction history.

Yoroi gave me restore option of  12, 15, or 24 keys, it had given me 15 keys when it made the wallet - is android mobile using only 12? Is this perhaps a piece of it? Address derivations look similar

This is the derivation yoroi nightly used (given the same mnemonic, resulting in different address)
m/44'/429'/0'/0


[02/03/2022 3:48 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I don't know why yoroi lets you choose between different words counts. It makes no difference how many words you have. every factor of 3 is valid. 

The derivation path is not complete, Yoroi doesn't tell you what the address really is. I suggest you derive 20 addresses on Android and I am sure the one you are looking for is in the list


[02/03/2022 3:49 PM] SoCool#6419
Derived 21 and not seeing it :/


[02/03/2022 3:50 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I don't have an explanation for this. but if you tap on a derived address the full path is shown, it's the same with an index that is incremented.


[02/03/2022 3:51 PM] SoCool#6419
I'm curious if it's yoroi nightly having some new changes breaking compatibility


[02/03/2022 3:51 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I doubt it, they won't change the derivation path


[02/03/2022 3:52 PM] SoCool#6419
Yeah, I see the derivations for the generated addresses.

When you have time - perhaps get the latest yoroi nightly and create a new wallet in it, then use the mnemonic in android wallet and see if it reproduces transparently for you as well. I'll create a new wallet right now to see if the same behaviour occurs again..


[02/03/2022 3:58 PM] SoCool#6419
Yeah, didn't reproduce with the creation of a new wallet. So, I must be...repeatedly incorrectly entering the mnemonic on my android device, while entering it correctly on my PC..


[02/03/2022 3:59 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
that should trigger the warning, but it could happen by coincidence that the other mnemonic is valid, too. can happen but is highly unlikely


[02/03/2022 4:02 PM] SoCool#6419
The mnemonic android displays back to me matches perfectly with what I wrote down too. I feel like perhaps there's an oddity occurring with a word somewhere in this. The only distinction I can identify is that yoroi makes me tab complete each individual word on restore while I type space between them in android mobile but that can't meaningfully matter


[02/03/2022 4:03 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yeah space is correct, it's what yoroi uses internally, too


[02/03/2022 4:16 PM] SoCool#6419
Yeah, the restore is definitely identical, just tried again - it's *this* mnemonic that's providing a different result in yoroi nightly vs. android mobile. Consistently.


[02/03/2022 4:17 PM] SoCool#6419
a new wallet creation did not have that result, but restoring this mnemonic on yoroi and android mobile multiple times now ends up with different addresses between them, double and triple checking my eyes I'm getting the mnemonic right on both of them


[02/03/2022 4:21 PM] SoCool#6419
Aside from possible future airdrops, the wallet is worthless - I emptied everything from it to other android mobile wallets. I'm happy to DM you the specific mnemonic, or other ergo devs who might be interested in reproducing / testing to see what the deal is with this mnemonic (maybe I'm crazy but I'm relatively confident I'm reproducing a legitimate issue)


[02/03/2022 4:31 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
if you are willing to DM it, do it and I'll look at it later.


[02/03/2022 4:32 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042

i am using test flight as read only on my iphone and my cold store is an android device not connected to the internet. i have never before had issues with signing transactions, but today i am not able to successfully scan the QR code with my signing device/cold storage wallet. it scans the QR code, makes a noise, and then goes back to an empty send screen with no values inputted


[02/06/2022 9:08 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yeah unfortunately we had to change the interchange format. that means version 1.5 and up are not compatible to versions 1.3/1.4. probably your ios device has updated to 1.5+ while your cold wallet device is still on an older version. you can upgrade the cold wallet device by sideloading


[02/06/2022 9:25 PM] liquid_phase#4605
ah, thanks for that - im glad it's a known bug and its not something weird .

[02/06/2022 9:27 PM] liquid_phase#4605
second question: will sideload upgrading the app reset the wallet contents and cause me to need to reload from mnemonic ?


[02/06/2022 9:28 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
It's not a bug but was unfortunately needed to be changed 
Updating will not reset the data, no need to do anything.

Thanks @MrStahlfelge !!


[02/06/2022 11:42 PM] MGpai#4313
@MrStahlfelge a couple things I noticed with the wallet

If I restore my Ergo mobile wallet to nautilus everything works well, Nautilus picks up the various address.
However, if I go back to my mobile wallet, it does not pick up any of the new address that were generated by
Nautilus. So if I made a tx and all my tokens moved to a different box, mobile wallet does not realize that and 
shows the token balance as zero


[02/06/2022 11:43 PM] MGpai#4313
2) If I want to use ergopay is there a feature that lets me paste the url rather than scanning the qr?


[02/06/2022 11:43 PM] MGpai#4313
It can get difficult if I want to share the qr to another user if they only have one device


[02/06/2022 11:43 PM] MGpai#4313
then how could they scan the qr which is displayed on their phone itself


[02/07/2022 2:24 AM] SoCool#6419
Perhaps wherever the QR is shown, a link may be under it to link out to the URI which would launch the mobile app as the ErgoPay handler, so it would be something the app creator can handle where they put the QR

[02/07/2022 2:26 AM] SoCool#6419
New addresses are just derivations of the base with indexes. Go into your mobile wallet app and create new addresses through the add address UI and it should just start deriving the addresses Nautilus did

{Reactions}
üëç 

[02/07/2022 2:27 AM] SoCool#6419
They're generally just derived with an incrementing seed so any wallet you use will be able to derive the same ones in the same order. However no wallet knows another wallet derived addresses or what it did because the wallets aren't connected, they're just keys to the chain

in the iOS application, the color of the header /top bar is unfortunately blocking the color of the low battery - so it is not possible to see if the battery is critically empty or just in the red (the battery was at 19% in this picture)

no. using comma is suppressed by intention so that users living in regions where comma is used as decimal separator don't confuse it and accidently send 2,050 tokens instead of 2.05

@MrStahlfelge the mainnet node used by the mobile wallet is stagnating in its last 10 blocks all morning - that's not right is it?

What does that mean, stagnating?


[02/24/2022 10:20 PM] SoCool#6419
I was able to send ErgoPay transactions from SAFEW to it this morning, then it kept rejecting them saying my TX creation height was greater than it was supposed to be - this is the `height` for the last of the last 10 block headers on that node:

"height" : 693246

It's been that height all morning. I used another node and was able to send a TX and I can see their last 10 block headers have heights increasing:


[02/24/2022 10:20 PM] SoCool#6419
You're using http://213.239.193.208:9053/blocks/lastHeaders/10 where the height isn't increasing


[02/24/2022 10:20 PM] SoCool#6419
Pulled this node from the spyder and I can see the height increasing http://147.182.220.251:9053/blocks/lastHeaders/10


[02/24/2022 10:22 PM] SoCool#6419
Not sure who owns or manages that node, just been presuming it's run by the main ergo folks since it's what you have hard coded into the mobile wallet


[02/24/2022 10:22 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042

[02/24/2022 10:22 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042

[02/24/2022 10:23 PM] SoCool#6419
Righto. Will it cause issues for mobile wallet users while its not syncing? ErgoPay being out of band will have issues, but what about other TX run through mobile wallet?


[02/24/2022 10:24 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Not sure of tx will deliver to the network if it is not syncing. Apart from that it could work out as long there are boxes to spent for the users

Hey, What is the best and safest ergo wallet you guys think?


[02/27/2022 10:19 PM] SoCool#6419
They're all good for different things, except Yoroi which is slow and inconsistent. Try each and choose for yourself, they're all open source as well so regarding security concerns you're absolutely welcome to read the code as many of us have to assuage our own concerns


[03/02/2022 6:21 PM] Get Syked#7710
Anyone know if the Nautilus wallet has been audited yet? Am a bit wary to use it before an audit has been done...


[03/03/2022 10:42 PM] SoCool#6419
No audit, though it's open source, as is SAFEW and rather easy to read through. Little comfort if you can't read the code.

If you're really uncomfortable about these things, just use SAFEW with an ErgoPay wallet - you don't have to put a mnemonic in it, you use the mobile app (made by a core dev) to execute the transactions by QR code.

In this way, the wallet actually can't access your funds, it just shows what's at an address and presents transactions for you to sign with the wallet on your phone that can access them

came across an issue/bug with the ios app, not sure where it is best to report/seek assistance. holding a small amount of erg, two nfts, two lp tokens, and two other tokens in the wallet in question. moved a token from a different wallet to this wallet (using ergo ios app) and simultaneously swapped a small amount of erg for the same token today in ergodex (used nautilus), since the transactions processed i am only able to view 0.001 erg and the tokens i had transferred in the ios app. I confirmed that all of the assets are still readily viewable and accessible via the nautilus extension (and the lp is accessible in ergodex), but the assets no longer appear in the ergo ios app. I do not have privacy mode turned on in nautilus. any thoughts?

so it looks like you want to send ALL your erg, but not your token. but you need to keep some erg to hold the token, or you need to send the token


[03/23/2022 1:34 PM] Canto#6710
how many minimum erg i need to hold?


[03/23/2022 1:34 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
you have to hold 0.001 - you got that amount with that mi goreng

I had an issue restoring a wallet in the android app - I originally created a 15word mnemonic wallet in Yoroi Chrome Extension and when I tried restoring in the Android app, it created a wallet with a different address and none of the derived addresses were correct either. I must've tried 3 times with the mnemonic with the same result (even tried again now - same thing). I ended up restoring the wallet on a different computer under Yoroi Chrome and it worked so I was able to move the coins. Not sure what happened...


[03/25/2022 7:06 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
For certain mnemonics derivation in node/wallet app is wrong. The fix is already done but waiting for approval.
This might be the problem but I could only check that by knowing the mnemonic.


[03/25/2022 5:35 PM] shadx#8137
Got ya, I can check again when it gets incorporated, thanks!

@MrStahlfelge how would ergopay/ergowallet work with a proxy contract?
im imagining a physical store that sells physical goods like food. i want the user to send money to a proxy contract using ergopay with a qr code, so that they could trust that the funds could only be spent in a specific way. how could someone do this with ergopay? and what if, in order to generate the proxy, it also required extra information from the user, like their pk and some other p2s address?


[03/28/2022 8:19 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
there is no difference. when you built the transaction the user is presented to sign, you have to build it with outputs for the proxy contract. you can even set registers


[03/28/2022 1:40 PM] nitram147#5106
Good job @MrStahlfelge ‚ù§Ô∏è  Today I tried new version of wallet and I was really glad to see import/export of xpub key feature and it's working like a charm üëç


[03/28/2022 1:41 PM] nitram147#5106
What is the reason to ask for spending password when deriving new addresses? (in non-read only mode) Are xpub key also stored encrypted?


[03/28/2022 1:43 PM] nitram147#5106
And as a feedback, I've seen that keyboard isn't trying to auto-correct words üëç , however it would be still probably better (even if it's a bit worse user experience) to use in-app keyboard - app will have buttons for each keys and user will tap those buttons (for inspiration see coinomi wallet).


[03/28/2022 1:43 PM] nitram147#5106
Another thing - app allowed me to make screenshot during entering the seed phrase - this should be disabled.


[03/28/2022 1:45 PM] nitram147#5106
Also I know that app can detect whether there is some app running in the "foreground" and could alert user about it or even disable access to app - many banking apps do so. So there wouldn't be any android application which would be silently recording user screen - this is useful not only during entering or showing (from the settings) of the mnemonics phrase, but also can be good for privacy (account balance when user is viewing the app) üôÇ


[03/28/2022 1:48 PM] lgd#5847
in this example, would this require two tx (one to make the proxy and send user funds to it, with the second to use the funds in the proxy for the sale) or could it all be done with just one tx?


[03/28/2022 1:49 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
banking app usually use promon shield or something like that, a paid security guard doing all that stuff - not a big fan of this, as it often bites back by restricting legit use cases for recording or using password manager as keyboard. source: before ergo I maintained a banking app üòÑ

Spending password is ask on deriving addresses because app does not store xpubkey outside encrypted data when mnemonic is available


[03/28/2022 1:50 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
with ergopay you don't need any proxy address unless you need it for delayed excution. if there is delayed execution, you need two tx, of course.


[03/28/2022 1:59 PM] lgd#5847
but then are we not just trusting that someone's backend executes the tx in the right way?


[03/28/2022 2:10 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
it can't get executed in the wrong way, user signs it exactly like you generated it. the tx id is a hash of the contained data


[03/28/2022 2:11 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
it can get lost/never executed, but that is the same when sending to a proxy


[03/28/2022 2:11 PM] lgd#5847
but if im just presented a qr code, how do i know?


[03/28/2022 2:12 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
did you never try what happens when you scan a qr in the app?

[03/28/2022 4:18 PM] lgd#5847
when the mobile wallet makes the request by scanning the qr code, is it possible to make a request that asks the wallet to provide more information than just the PK? could another standard like the #P2PK_ADDRESS# be made, but for a p2s address as well for example?


[03/28/2022 4:19 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
it is possible to exteend the specification, but what p2s address should be used? the wallet only holds p2pk addresses


[03/28/2022 4:20 PM] lgd#5847
im thinking what if someone wants to make a dapp integration with the mobile wallet, and a p2s address comes from the dapp integration but p2pk from mobile wallet. so both could be used for a qr code request


[03/28/2022 4:20 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
please give an example


[03/28/2022 4:25 PM] lgd#5847
for example, let's say someone wants to make a identity solution dapp that integrates with the wallet. license/id/certification information is stored in boxes each with their own p2s script. the dapp integration can track these p2s addresses and that's how the app would show the different ids to the user. let's say someone wants to buy alcohol at a store, but needs to verify the id to make sure you are 18+. you could imagine a tx that asks for the pk to spend money but also for p2s of some id from the dapp integration so the store backend could verify information. the store would want to make a tx request that asks the wallet to provide a pk to pay for beverage, but also the p2s from the dapp integration for the persons id. this is what i was thinking, not sure if it makes sense/possible


[03/28/2022 4:27 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
just sending the p2s address to the backend is no authentication, a user can fake such a request without any problems.


[03/28/2022 4:32 PM] lgd#5847
right, but the point is the information stored in the box at that p2s could somehow be verified


[03/28/2022 4:33 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
the dapp knows the information about the p2s box, so what is the point in having such information sent by the app itself which knows nothing about this box? you can add this param to your qr code that is generated from your dapp


[03/28/2022 4:35 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
it is somehow similar to my burning tokens example which adds the id of the token tu burn to the qr code. the app routes this to the backend without actually knowing what that means, backend can build the transaction to burn the token. instead of token id, you can send p2s address, tx id, box ids... anything you want.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[03/28/2022 4:36 PM] lgd#5847
yeah that is what i meant. but you had to insert that manually for your example. i guess using your token example, could this be done from within the wallet app with a dapp integration possibly, like on the phone? in the case of an id, it would be automatic perhaps.


[03/28/2022 4:38 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
the app does not contain any logic of your dapp, so it can't calculate and give you information it is not aware of


[03/28/2022 4:40 PM] lgd#5847
ok i thought in the future the mobile wallet was doing something like minotaur for dapp integration. to have additional screen within app. my bad for confusion

yes, that is planned but not available for now

if you don't update the app won't start when it is expired. as long as you keep your seed phrase safely stored, then you will be able to restore your wallet on another wallet application

@MrStahlfelge would it be possible to add an option for manually adding sub addresses to read only wallets? atm the only option is just adding a new read only wallet per sub address, which leads to a bloated wallet list. It would be great to consolidate sub addresses also for read only wallets.


[04/02/2022 5:27 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
You can do that by adding the wallet with its xpubkey. Then you can derive addresses even for read only wallets üëç

Yoroi is very problematic, also SAFEW let's you use the mobile app to sign so your browser never has your signing key. Nautilus is also a well made wallet for browser that people are mostly using. Yoroi is unstable and problematic

Something interesting happened to me today, which made me question the security of the cold storage on an old android phone.

I have couple year old phone, never been connected to the internet since a reload, has no sim card or carrier. It is usually also Off unless i need it to sign something, which is never. I happened to have it on today while it was charging, and suddenly it received an emergency alert about a missing senior citizen in my local area. I received the same alert on my phone which is my daily driver.

How is it possible that the phone received an over the network update ?


[04/05/2022 3:51 AM] 0xMNITY#6979
the emergency broadcast channel is configured into the phone to be able to receive those alerts. It's separate from the carrier I believe. Did you have airplane mode on? I usually leave my airplane mode on even though the phone is off.

[04/13/2022 10:55 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
wallet config -> addresses -> add more

Awesome, thank you! Still don't understand how my funds end up in derived addresses. I haven't used them (knowingly).


[04/13/2022 12:02 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
nautilus uses them automatically afaik, causes a lot of trouble

change node to http://159.65.11.55:9053/ the default one is stuck or out of sync


[04/13/2022 2:07 PM] JOFLITO#0000
thanks kind sir


[04/13/2022 10:06 PM] nitram147#5106
Right now are settings also centralized (via default values in the app). Maybe it would be better to provide user with option to automatically retrieve information about which node & explorer to use from some centralized server - it would not increase nor decrease the centralization, however in case that the default node would be stucked, you as the author can switch default node for all users wallets which has this feature enabled. User would be always able to switch this feature off and manually select node & explorer of their choice üôÇ


[04/13/2022 10:10 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yeah I also thought about it today.
for now, I still hope that https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/issues/1652 moves forward so it is not needed.

Hi, cannot seem to send transactions. Two things i tried.
1. Using ergopay for the ergogames IDO. That gives me - "could not prepare transaction" - "Cannot load utbox xxxxxxxxx
2. Transfering the tokens to my hot wallet (they are in a cold wallet). That returns "400:( bad request. Malformed transactoin Outputs should have creation height not exceding block height. 728577 <= 728532 is not true


[04/15/2022 2:11 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
second problem can be fixed by changing node to  http://159.65.11.55:9053/


[04/15/2022 2:11 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
probably first problem is fixed by this, too, please check

what is the place to go if I want to create a QR with a transaction?


[04/15/2022 3:08 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
what do you mean? what transaction should be in the qr?


[04/15/2022 3:08 PM] JOFLITO#0000
I want to put an asset on a box, and the first user to find the "hidden QR" to be able to claim it


[04/15/2022 3:09 PM] JOFLITO#0000
like an egg hunt


[04/15/2022 3:10 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I see. problem here is that the transactions in the qr codes are unsigned and are signed on device by user. if you want to do that, you need to store the asset in a box that is secured by a pin or something, otherwise everyone can claim it


[04/15/2022 3:10 PM] curbsideprophet#5083

he really needa support


[04/15/2022 3:12 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
the cold wallet support is for Android devices that have no internet access (flight mode, tablet without wifi) - that's why it is cold. you can use your ios device to exchange data via qr code with the device without internet access.


[04/15/2022 3:13 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
ah, wallet app is only for ios 13 up, sorry. as long as the app is only on testflight it can't be used for cold storage on ios anyway. testflight app need internet access to be granted to run


[04/15/2022 3:15 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
Ok so for iOS users I only need TestFlight ergo wallet and that‚Äôs it? I can sign read only wallets TX? Sorry for basic questions lol

Is that 3rd component what I am missing to make this work?


[04/15/2022 3:20 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yes. you need a device that can sign your transactions (the math involved is a bit too much for a normal human to do)

Ok. Do you think an old android device would work for cross platform compatibility? My assumption is yes


[04/15/2022 3:24 PM] curbsideprophet#5083
I guess that is where I was confused but if just reading QR then not a problem


[04/15/2022 3:24 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yes you can mix it, Android and iOS can work together and I hope we have a desktop component in the future as well


[04/15/2022 3:25 PM] curbsideprophet#5083

 1.- I want the first person to find an egg, to be able to claim it as an NFT


[04/15/2022 3:32 PM] JOFLITO#0000
I thought about putting the egg on an unprotected box


[04/15/2022 3:32 PM] JOFLITO#0000
and use a QR with the transaction that claims the egg


[04/15/2022 3:32 PM] JOFLITO#0000
so the first guy that finds it, scans the QR and gets the egg


[04/15/2022 3:33 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
problem here is, this unprotected box would have the address for SigmaBoolean "true" (= everyone can spent), and I bet there are already scanners for this address immediately claiming boxes

so bots don't claim it


[04/15/2022 3:34 PM] JOFLITO#0000
still


[04/15/2022 3:34 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yes, and when building the reducedtransaction for the qr code you can set the pin on your server


[04/15/2022 3:35 PM] JOFLITO#0000
imagine I set the pin to "ergoPay"


[04/15/2022 3:35 PM] JOFLITO#0000
how would I create the qr


[04/15/2022 3:35 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
oh you don't need a server. you can build the reducedtransaction locally with appkit, serialize it, create the qr code and save it for someone to find it


[04/15/2022 3:36 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
ah no... that does not work because you don't know the address it should be sent to üòÑ

Would be really nice


[04/17/2022 9:00 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Yes I can do this when there is an open API to use for me that returns the erg value for these tokens. At the moment only ergodex API is integrated but I can add others.
Best is if you contact Ergopad team if they are interested and want to contact me

Hey again, picked up a really cheap mobile device today, not sure I'm doing this right but you scan the qr code using the scam icon top right and it should prepare to sign ?

exactly


[04/21/2022 4:25 PM] OlNick#0000
is the scanning sometimes tempremental, its not a very high spec camera


[04/21/2022 4:26 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
if the camera is not good the displaying device has a small icon on the top right to lower the qr code resolution

indeed


[04/21/2022 4:31 PM] OlNick#0000
So heres the issue


[04/21/2022 4:32 PM] OlNick#0000
this is on the ANETA for BTW - assume it makes no difference


[04/21/2022 4:32 PM] OlNick#0000
the offline device shows 0 as the balance, which I expected as it cant synch


[04/21/2022 4:33 PM] OlNick#0000
the online version has the same wallet address showing as the restored offline one

it actually scanned the small version that time


[04/21/2022 4:35 PM] OlNick#0000
but same message


[04/21/2022 4:38 PM] OlNick#0000
that suggests to me that the signing wallet isnt the same as the hot wallet - public keys do match, I just checked


[04/21/2022 4:40 PM] OlNick#0000
Any ideas?


[04/21/2022 4:40 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
sorry, don't understand what exactly is the issue. my suggestions: try with the ergo wallet app first. no problem to use aneta wallet but the UI changes they've made might have introduced issues


[04/21/2022 4:40 PM] OlNick#0000
ok, can do that

@MrStahlfelge Love to hear your thoughts on NFC integration.


[04/23/2022 7:28 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
so far most people suggested to have an address transferred via NFC, I think you suggested to do some kind of auth?

 Yes, I was thinking it would be a nice security feature to use nfc for confirmation when signing tx's.


[04/23/2022 7:36 PM] theta_decay#0000
Not as a password replacement, but in addition to.


[04/23/2022 7:59 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I think you mentioned the security keys that are existing? Probably could be a password replacement/addition but this would be a third factor when it is addition. And when it is replacement the two factors are both of type possession (you possess the mobile device and the NFC key)

 If you made a swap, and haven't received the coins you expected, can you please go to recent transaction page by clicking on the clock icon up the top right of the page. In here, if your transaction is pending, you need to refund by clicking on 3 dots and selecting refund. Once it has refunded, you will need to repeat the swap, but set the slippage to a higher value. I would recommend 5% as our pools have quite low liquidity!

Hi, it would be great if native speakers of a localization the wallet app already provides could check and add missing translations to the translation string files. to check what items are missing, compare the english file https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-wallet-app/blob/develop/android/src/main/res/values/strings.xml with the translated file /values-<languagecodehere>/strings.xml

no, this feature caused a lot of trouble in yoroi. but you can send everything by using the down button in the amount fields

Is it possible for the mobile wallet to have a native dapp connector? I used a mobile wallet on algorand some time ago, and it connected to the tinyman DEX.


[05/06/2022 9:08 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
The mobile wallet has a dapp connector integrated, dapps need to support it though. Some dapps integrated it, some did not.

 It does not work the way safew uses it because safew uses a way that is meant for small transactions. That's not SAFEW's fault though, the other way is that the wallet directly requests the data from the dapp. Which obviously only works if the app itself supports it.

Can they use the same solution as the mobile wallet? Where it creates several QR codes for larger transactions?

@MrStahlfelge Could you elaborate a bit? I'm working on the EIP (it's actually done and tested) which would extend your EIP-0029 with a new type. This new type (next free code 3) is a bit more complicated so it required it's own EIP. However, I did done everything there is only a few grammar correction needed, but to be my EIP compatibile with yours (https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/blob/eip29-tx-purpose/eip-0029.md) I need to export the data in format you have speficied. However even after reading about the ErgoTree serializatio format in it's paper I did not get it from your eip.

Let's have an example (text with type code 2):
```
"Your loan January"
3c0e400e035052500411596f7572206c6f616e204a616e75617279

[05/07/2022 12:15 PM] nitram147#5106
So from this I can deduce that your code could be next splited as follows:
``3c0e400e035052500411 - 596f7572206c6f616e204a616e75617279``

[05/07/2022 12:16 PM] nitram147#5106
So it means it could be split further as follows:


[05/07/2022 12:16 PM] nitram147#5106
```3c0e400e0350525004 - 11 - 596f7572206c6f616e204a616e75617279```


[05/07/2022 12:17 PM] nitram147#5106
And from this we can assume that:


[05/07/2022 12:18 PM] nitram147#5106
second part means length of the data, third part is data, but what about the first part

[05/07/2022 12:18 PM] nitram147#5106
in your EIP you have mentioned magic bytes as:


[05/07/2022 12:19 PM] nitram147#5106
``3c0e0e0350525``


[05/07/2022 12:19 PM] nitram147#5106
This isn't even bytes because the number of the character is odd


[05/07/2022 12:19 PM] nitram147#5106
Thus this mean it's only 6bytes and one nibble (4bits)


[05/07/2022 12:20 PM] nitram147#5106
By your description "fixed bytes .... which can be used to recognize the register" I assume they should be fixed


[05/07/2022 12:20 PM] nitram147#5106
However in your example there isn't your fixed bytes anywhere


[05/07/2022 12:21 PM] nitram147#5106
Based on your description I would assume the following shape:


[05/07/2022 12:21 PM] nitram147#5106
something - magic_bytes (one after another) - something else


[05/07/2022 12:21 PM] nitram147#5106
But in your example


[05/07/2022 12:21 PM] nitram147#5106
It's like following:


[05/07/2022 12:23 PM] nitram147#5106
3c0e (first 2 bytes from the magic bytes) - 40 (some strange value) - rest of the magic bytes - another 4bits (hex value 0) - 04 (another value) - lenght of the data - data


[05/07/2022 12:23 PM] nitram147#5106
What does the "40" and the "04" value means?


[05/07/2022 12:23 PM] nitram147#5106
Where is the type code 2 encoded?


[05/07/2022 12:23 PM] nitram147#5106
I couldn't figure it out


[05/07/2022 12:24 PM] nitram147#5106

[05/09/2022 4:25 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
you've stumbled over a part of the EIP that was not updated when we changed details of the encoding. `3c0e0e03505250` is outdated, the prefix is `3c0e400e03505250` (probably 04 as well). The magic bytes are 50,  52, 50 and `3c0e0e03` is added by the ergo value encoding for Tuple(Coll(Byte), ...)


[05/09/2022 4:37 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
updated, please check

Ergovalue has a encoding and prefix determines type of the element that follows. I don't know if there is a complete documentation but you can play around with appkit converting different ergovalue to hex


[05/09/2022 6:42 PM] nitram147#5106
Based on this it should mean that the int is following but that's simply not true

[05/09/2022 6:47 PM] nitram147#5106
Also if it is only for the purpose of symbolizing what is comming next, it means that the information about "content_type = 2" isn't encoded in it


[05/09/2022 6:47 PM] nitram147#5106
Shouldn't the information about the content_type value be encoded in the output bytes somehow?

@MrStahlfelge


[05/09/2022 6:50 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I think @morphic can shed some light here, I think he implemented it


[05/09/2022 8:10 PM] morphic#4133
General logic is like this
1) each register can contain any data type
2) each register is serialized as Constant value because each constant contains data type descriptor
3) each constant is serialized using ConstantSerializer
4) register format is the same as Constant format
5) constant format starts with <type bytes> followed by <data bytes>
6) type descriptor (sigmastate.SType) is deserialized first using TypeSerializer which consumes prefix of the bytes stream
7) having type descriptor one can continue reading data bytes (see DataSerializer) from the stream
8) The encoding of types is optimized for storage size so that in most cases it takes 1-2 bytes.


[05/09/2022 8:29 PM] morphic#4133
3c - tuple `(_,_)`
0e - first Coll[Byte]
40 - second tuple (_, Coll[Byte])
0e  - second Coll[Byte]
then data bytes start
03 - length of magic bytes array
505250 - magic bytes
04 - first component of the second pair (corresponds to content type)
11 - length of second Coll[Byte] component
then bytes itself of second Coll[Byte] component


[05/09/2022 8:39 PM] nitram147#5106
Why does than the content type has value of "0x04" if it is supposed to be 2 (dec) = 0x02 (hex), based on the EIP


[05/09/2022 8:40 PM] nitram147#5106
@morphic


[05/09/2022 8:40 PM] nitram147#5106

[05/09/2022 8:41 PM] nitram147#5106
@MrStahlfelge I suppose the reason for encoding the attachment like this is that it's content could be easily read via smartcontract (in ErgoScript) if it's done this way. Am I right?


[05/09/2022 8:42 PM] nitram147#5106
Because my EIP is about encrypted messages which only the sender and receiver could read, encoding it via this scheme doesn't make much sense - smartcontract reading the data will not be able to deduce anything from the data (because the smartcontract cannot decrypt the data).


[05/09/2022 8:44 PM] nitram147#5106
So I think that it would be maybe better to use custom encoding which would not add so much bytes overhead to the data and thus save not negligible amount of block space üôÇ


[05/09/2022 8:45 PM] nitram147#5106
What do you think about it? üôÇ


[05/09/2022 8:46 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
No. Registers are always ergovalue. So needs to be an ergovalue. 
The overhead is not so much, the data representation used here is hex encoding but this is not the way it is saved on the blockchain


[05/09/2022 8:50 PM] nitram147#5106
Yes, but it could be saved just as Coll[Byte]


[05/09/2022 8:51 PM] nitram147#5106
Where first n-bytes (for example 5), would be used as "magic bytes", and next bytes would be for the content


[05/09/2022 8:51 PM] nitram147#5106
This would mean it will look like:


[05/09/2022 8:51 PM] nitram147#5106
0eXXdata


[05/09/2022 8:51 PM] nitram147#5106
where XX - is length of data in hexa


[05/09/2022 8:52 PM] nitram147#5106
So the overhead of encoding all the tuples will be skipped


[05/09/2022 8:52 PM] nitram147#5106
@MrStahlfelge


[05/09/2022 8:54 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
That was the first approach, but we updated it because now it is more flexible with different types.
Of course you can make a suggestion using another header and using another format. But this will only save a few bytes for the disadvantage that it is not compatible with the current approach


[05/09/2022 8:56 PM] nitram147#5106
Current approach also store the value in register R9, which means that there need to be added 5 additional bytes


[05/09/2022 8:56 PM] nitram147#5106
Current "basic" transaction size (1 input, two outputs) have about 300bytes


[05/09/2022 8:57 PM] nitram147#5106
So only the 1byte overhead to reach R9 would mean 1.6% increase of transaction size


[05/09/2022 8:57 PM] nitram147#5106
But yeah, this could be probably viewed as negligible


[05/09/2022 8:57 PM] nitram147#5106
So to be compatibile with your EIP-0029 how should my data looks like


[05/09/2022 8:58 PM] nitram147#5106
``a02d035a40ad4debb3``


[05/09/2022 8:59 PM] nitram147#5106
This is the data which I would like to store (in hex format)


[05/09/2022 8:59 PM] nitram147#5106
How it would like with a corresponding header with content_type = 3


[05/09/2022 8:59 PM] nitram147#5106

[05/09/2022 9:05 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Maybe a good opportunity to start.
More interesting than the actual encoding was the idea how to encrypt the data... If you create the EIP we can complete example encoding etc later, the idea is the most important thing to have


[05/09/2022 9:06 PM] nitram147#5106
The EIP is completed (and it is from friday)


[05/09/2022 9:07 PM] nitram147#5106
However the EIP also contains reference implementation in Python


[05/09/2022 9:07 PM] nitram147#5106
And I would like to also include a real onchain transaction from alice to bob where will be some message encrypted


[05/09/2022 9:08 PM] nitram147#5106
And provide both alice and bob mnemonic into the eip so wallet developers could try their decoding implementation when they import these mnemonics...


[05/09/2022 9:08 PM] nitram147#5106
But I wanted to upload EIP as ready to merge - final. And to do so I want to have stable output format encoding - the correct "preamble" bytes which will go to the register R9

Can we have a positive sign for a confirmed transaction instead of a exclaimation mark? Like a tick or some other which denotes "success"

cool, thanks. we should move to #üó£‚îÇeips  and #‚ùì‚îÇdev-support . for the encryption, someone else than me should check if this introduces any security issues.

The core capability is already in Appkit and/or underlying Sigma. The missing part is how to implement secure communication between cosigners. For example when they want to spend a box protected by 2-out-of-3 signature (see CTHRESHOLD class of SigmaBoolean tree in Sigma). 
Each cosigner need to generate partial signature using pre-sign data from other cosigners, so communication should be organized. 
Once the cosigner obtains the required data he/she can use ErgoProver and give is the right "hints" to generate partial signature and send it to other cosigners.
So even for simple 2-out-of-3 signature this is at least 3 step process involving 2 cosigners. 
Keeping this in mind, what can be added to Appkit is higher level API (builders) which generalise in two dimensions: 
1) support spending many multisig inputs 
2) Support co-signing general SigmaBoolean proposition (not only simple k-out-of-n)
And because parties may use different wallets, the communication protocol and data formats should be described as EIP

[05/16/2022 4:50 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
at the moment for me there is more information missing. why is secure communication needed? what is the output when only one out of n signed a transaction? is it an `UnsignedTransaction` or a `SignedTransaction`? Best was if we had a unit test/spec demonstrating how signing with multiple keys is done. such a test would not need secure communication and would serve as a demonstration

[05/17/2022 11:09 AM] morphic#4133
In general the workflow is:
1) create UnsignedTransaction (basically the bytes which needs to be signed)
2) scatter it among cosigners
3) collect data from cosigners
4) create SignedTransaction using the data collected
5) send it to blockchain
The details are tricky and TBH I also don't have clear picture. 
I can do it only after v5.0.1 is out.

I don't see anything which would prevent just frontend implementation


[05/22/2022 8:57 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
because the data it transfers to the wallet is a complete prebuild transaction that the user has to sign. depending on the number of input and output boxes, this data can exceed any restrictions for URLs and QR codes. that's why the direct transfer of the transaction within the URL or QR code is only meant for very small transactions. The way that always should be preferred is the ergopay URL to a server that sends the data via https


[05/22/2022 8:58 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
additionally, a simple "connect wallet" functionality cannot work in frontend only because the reply from the wallet application has to be sent to a backend server.


[05/22/2022 9:00 PM] nitram147#5106
If I was sure that the entire transaction would fit into the QR code, I could just show QR code to the user and in background watch mempool for expected signed transaction (no need to "connect wallet" functionality)


[05/22/2022 9:00 PM] nitram147#5106
Everything can run on the frontend so no need to have backend (can be easily hosted on github pages for example...)


[05/22/2022 9:01 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yes. but how can you be sure?


[05/22/2022 9:02 PM] nitram147#5106
If I know that I want user to sign transaction which would consume 1 to 3 of his UTXOs (if he have only small UTXO I would ask him to consolidate his funds) and create for example 3 outputs, I should be able to guess the resulting length in advance


[05/22/2022 9:03 PM] nitram147#5106
(Because everything is of fixed size and isn't dependent on user's address)


[05/22/2022 9:06 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yeah if you ask for consolidation first you can do this. but this is not an optimal solution - hence it should be done on a backend server, but you can work in frontend entirely

@MrStahlfelge Based on your observation (https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-wallet-app/issues/5) does the Ergo's mempool really work in that way that it discards any transaction using the same UTXO as some transaction which already exists in the mempool? I would expect that both of those transactions will be included in the mempool and miners will then choose themselves which one to include in the block (If I'm right Bitcoin's mempool support containment of "double-spend" transactions, so you can always broadcast many transactions spending same UTXO (obviously only one will be included in the block, however you are able to see all in the mempool before one from them is mined))

[05/24/2022 12:18 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
The transaction is accepted and not rejected, but one of the two vanishes so quickly that it does not make a big difference.
For me it looks like the node discards one of the transactions. In the end, the node is what the miners use. As long as only one implementation of the node exists, "miners choose" translates to "node implementation does" in practice

@MrStahlfelge Hello sir, sorry to bother you again. I have another query. When I try to create a wallet through restore option by putting my randomly selected more than 24 words to restore/generate a wallet, the app creates a wallet but it gives a warning that 'mnemonics validation failed' but if I proceed nevertheless it creates/restores the corresponding wallet. So I would like to know why that happens? Is it related to checksum? and could it be a trouble in future?


[05/27/2022 3:05 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
yes, it is a checksum validation. in mnemonics last word is a checksum word to check typos, so when you manually selected this does not fit. 
It will prevent you from restoring in some applications, but mobile wallet app will remain like it is and restore everything after showing a warning.

Quick question regarding the iOS wallet in testflight: after I restore the mnemonic, I could only see a part of my ergs. I tried to derrive like 100 addresses but the balance doesn‚Äôt change. The settings of the wallet are on default. Am i doing smth wrong?


[05/29/2022 6:59 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Are you sure that your other addresses are derived addresses?


[05/29/2022 7:17 PM] alin#1301
Is they are not derrived, is there a possibility to display them or should i send everything to one main address?


[05/29/2022 7:17 PM] alin#1301
If*


[05/29/2022 7:18 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
with what wallet did you create the addresses the funds are now distributed on?


[05/29/2022 7:18 PM] alin#1301
Yoroi


[05/29/2022 7:18 PM] alin#1301
And maybe nautilus as well


[05/29/2022 7:19 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042

[05/29/2022 7:19 PM] alin#1301
Yup


[05/29/2022 7:19 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
that is weird. but you can send them to one address.

Wat's the best node to use in the mobile wallet?
I'm using the default one but it's been synching really slow lately. I have to wait 10 minutes between sending transactions whilst is syncs....


[06/05/2022 9:14 PM] Flying Pig#0000
Also tried to enter my own node (on local lan). That's slow too :)


[06/05/2022 9:14 PM] Flying Pig#0000
Unless it's explorer that's slow


[06/05/2022 9:14 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
it had a hiccup right today, was reliable the last days.
You can always check this list which nodes are on the latest blocks https://api.tokenjay.app/peers/list


[06/05/2022 9:15 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
(re @Flying Pig : *Unless it's explorer that's slow*) 
 
 yeah explorer is slow the last days for me. but this affects the time it needs to send a transaction, should not make you wait 10 minutes in between


[06/05/2022 9:16 PM] Flying Pig#0000
maybe it's the node. Weird my local one doesn't work...i'll try one of the ones in the list.


[06/05/2022 9:19 PM] Flying Pig#0000
nope, still not synching. Got the red broken cloud icon (last synched 2 hours ago :))


[06/05/2022 9:19 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000

 I think it is not a feature for the main app as most users are not deep into the model and would not understand the purpose.
But with ErgoPay and with the new plugin system is possible to implement this as an add on for power users.
The ergopay showcase features a screen where you can paste a box id that should be spent to demonstrate that ErgoPay is capable to do this

I see. yes, we are aware that the situation is not perfect and armeanio does what he can to change it. from my side, I can assure the wallet is stable and safe to use as it is and we will update it every time before it will get out of order due to the time limit set by Apple

@MrStahlfelge I would like to ask is the mobile wallet safe to use when connected using a public WiFi connection? If the mnemonic is authentication-protected, is it stored on the device anywhere? Can it be viewed in any way by 3rd parties? Thank you

(re @Jay : *@MrStahlfelge I would like to ask is the mobile wallet safe to use when connected using a public WiFi connection? If the mnemonic is authentication-protected, is it stored on the device anywhere? Can it be viewed in any way by 3rd parties? Thank you*) 
 
 type of connection is not a problem, and as long as the mnemonic is stored in the app and not accessed it is stored with a encryption that is too hard to get decoded by someone without your authentication.
the security problems lay in the level when the mnemonic is entered the first time via the device keyboard, or when it is displayed on wallet creation. in theory, malware can access it at that points of time by screenrecording. the risk is pretty low as the modern smartphone OS prevent such behaviour, but of course there are security flaws in Android and iOS. if you are afraid of that, you should use a cold device.

 You mean TokenJay? Changing suggested fee is no problem. Address is a problem. I can set it to the one connected in tokenjay, but if it is set this way it can't get changed any more later.

 Ergodex has the option to choose a default address. Would that work on Tokenjay?


[06/18/2022 11:32 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *Ergodex has the option to choose a default address. Would that work on Tokenjay?*) 
 
 No, the reason lies in wallet app: it does not provide a way to have a preselected address that can be changed. It either has no address set and shows the selection, or one is set and then it can't be changed.


[06/18/2022 11:34 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Hm, it could be done by letting more addresses to be connected to TokenJay. But I don't know if this does not get too complicated for users


[06/18/2022 11:41 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Personally, I scan from within a wallet, and it asks me to select an address, if memory serves. So may be fine as is, just maybe needs some indication on the info pages.

 Then switch to mobile, which doesn't have those limitations.

I‚Äôm Just saying why we don‚Äôt address that. Future planning

[06/19/2022 7:06 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re  : *<HelixEvo> I‚Äôm Just saying why we don‚Äôt address that. Future planning*) 
 
 The problem is how do you address it? It would mean tunneling through ports 80 or 443, which is not something a wallet does. That's something you set your VPN or other network software to do.


[06/19/2022 7:07 PM] cafebedouin#0000
This is how you get feature creep. A wallet connecting to a dApp is in the realm of what a wallet does. Tunneling through ports? Not wallet functionality.


[06/19/2022 7:11 PM] HelixEvo#2120
It‚Äôs a node call. So call to one of the nodes that is https port


[06/19/2022 7:18 PM] HelixEvo#2120
So instead of to http://<node public>:9053 have the value https://ergonode.blocpow.io as one example


[06/19/2022 7:22 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I would gladly do that, but at the moment nodes cannot report on which url they are listening. 9053 and http is just a guess from the p2p port that is reported. we have an issue to enhance the node: https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/issues/1652 - I hope this one gets solved anytime in the future. when it is, I can add a node detection to wallet app and of course https urls are preferred


[06/19/2022 7:31 PM] HelixEvo#2120
So does this get nodes public IP from the config file or


[06/19/2022 7:37 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
the wallet app has an harcoded one at the moment. once the issue #1652 is resolved, it will try to fetch other nodes from this node to have fallbacks


[06/19/2022 7:38 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Just thinking, if it‚Äôs getting the IP put into config by the node operator, then what happens with people running nodes personally where they have dynamic IPs.


[06/19/2022 7:38 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Won‚Äôt you end up with a list of shitty IPs


[06/19/2022 7:39 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
they either don't put any in there as the node can't be used, or they put their dyndns name in


[06/19/2022 7:39 PM] HelixEvo#2120
Ahh right. So aslong as people know what they are doing and not putting in statics when their ISP is dynamic it should be fine


[06/19/2022 7:46 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
guess that is not much of a problem. most people do not expose the http api anyway. the ones that want to do it will know


[06/19/2022 8:28 PM] cafebedouin#0000

Hey guys for the Ergo wallet on the iOS app store, do we know when it will exit the TestFlight? Kinda concerned using it since it expires in XX days


[06/20/2022 10:25 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
No need to be concerned, we push updates regularly. You can use the seed phrase on other platforms as well to restore your wallet.

The actual app store listing is depending on ergo foundation getting a duns number


[06/20/2022 10:49 PM] elazor#0115
cool thanks man .. duns took me about 1 hour hopefully they can work it out soon üôÇ

@MrStahlfelge How are you sending (relaying) transactions? Transactions sent from your testnet wallet are shown in the testnet explorer mempool, while transactions sent from the nautilus are not. Probably one of you relay them via explorer and another one via node üôÇ


[06/23/2022 4:41 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Submitted via node while Nautilus is using explorer

[06/23/2022 7:21 PM] nitram147#5106
Nautilus seems also to be using node to relay transactions (testnet ones)


[06/23/2022 7:32 PM] nitram147#5106
I've been playing with it and tried to manually send transaction via same endpoint as Nautilus use and I goes to the mempool. From this observation I deduced that Nautilus must send the transaction in some strange format which is OK for the node but Invalid for the explorer (so the transaction is not shown in the explorer's mempool).


[06/23/2022 7:54 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
not sure but nemo will know more. I remember him saying that he uses explorer api, weird


[06/23/2022 9:06 PM] nitram147#5106
For the testnet it was changed before the hackathon because the explorer relay was not working (or maybe still isn't working?) reliable so nemo made a quick fix for it


[06/23/2022 9:06 PM] nitram147#5106
(but just for the testnet)

I can't send now I'm worried


[06/26/2022 5:41 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Probably you've changed something on device authentication settings. That invalidated all saved secrets. Restore from mnemonic.


[06/26/2022 9:20 AM] HaychAU#7544
Ok thanks I'll give it a go


[06/26/2022 9:21 AM] HaychAU#7544
Yeah I use fingerprint now. Seems once you change that the app fails.


[06/26/2022 9:41 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Change in authentication -> hardware bound secrets are deleted. So the app can't access them any more

(re @MrStahlfelge : *No. Can you give me the full error that is shown in settings -> debug (on the page bottom)*) 
 
 Yes, i will ask for the full error details. This is from another user.


[06/26/2022 8:40 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
If it is not the latest version, ask to update the app


[06/26/2022 8:42 PM] theta_decay#0000
(re @MrStahlfelge : *If it is not the latest version, ask to update the app*) 
 
 Will do, thank you Mr. Stahlfelge.


[06/27/2022 5:04 PM] nitram147#5106
If you can detect that this happened, maybe you can show popup with the error together with hint with text like: "This usually happens when you change your device security settings eg. set-up of new fingerprint etc. If it's your case, please remove this wallet and restore it again from mnemonic seed". It would improved UI a lot. I assume that many people are frequently changing fingerprints and etc. so this can happen to many people, while a lot of them do not have discord to ask for a help üôÇ


[06/27/2022 5:06 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
true. I have to play around with it. Unfortunately, Android just gives a "SecurityException" and all the information is in the describing text. but the "SecurityException" is even thrown when the user just cancels the authentication. api is not so well designed on that side.


[06/27/2022 5:07 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
so I have to check what exceptions I get that hint to the problem, but it might be different explanation messages for other manufacturers and android versions üòï


[06/27/2022 5:11 PM] nitram147#5106
Maybe a list of possible scenarios which could lead to the same error will be ok - user will go through the list and will know whether he changed fingerprints or canceled the authentification dialog üôÇ


[06/27/2022 5:12 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
simple help message. good idea


[06/28/2022 6:49 AM] arkadias#4896
@MrStahlfelge any chance we could have an optional setting for the wallet app to have a pin/pattern/fingerprint to access it for privacy? that way details remain hidden until its unlocked.

Hi!  I am using the ergo mobile wallet on my phone.   When I send ergo to an exchange with it, what network does it use?


[06/28/2022 10:12 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
wdym? wifi? mobile data? which ergo node?


[06/28/2022 10:13 PM] BuckSkin#6730
I sent some ergo to Coinex, and it arrived there.  However it is frozen until a certain number of block confirmations occur.  What block chain did the ergo use to get to Coinex?


[06/28/2022 10:15 PM] BuckSkin#6730
Once I hit send, did it use erc20?


[06/28/2022 10:28 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
It used ergo main net


[06/28/2022 10:36 PM] BuckSkin#6730
thanks!  so how many blocks to do a block confirmation?


[06/28/2022 10:57 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Depends on coinex. Kucoin used 10


[06/28/2022 11:00 PM] BuckSkin#6730
it says it needs 10 and has 5


[06/28/2022 11:00 PM] BuckSkin#6730
but it has been 10 hours, and no increase in block confirmations


[06/28/2022 11:00 PM] BuckSkin#6730

 lol not to obvious for most people . Would be nice to see a design proposal for the mobile wallets


[07/17/2022 6:01 PM] üçÄTheZiküáØüá≤#5382
I just want to improve the design, and if design will suits mrstahlfege, I want to finish it. I do a mock-up 1st and we will see if he wants to continue

Here are two options that match ergo new website. It‚Äôs extremely rough draft and I would like to know what the community thinks, which option should I continue to work with? Should I continue with the design? Do you like it?

 Imo I would prefer to choose the wallets and then they appear like in the second opinion


[07/17/2022 10:34 PM] koutelier#0000
The slide tab may confuse people


[07/17/2022 10:35 PM] koutelier#0000
Or make it difficult to slide through 10 wallets

Really noice looking design

I have huge experience in various designs and I want ergo wallet to look as better as possible.  
We can discuss any other designs I just need someone to talk to so we can discuss all the little details of the app, I guess I should talk to MrStahlfelge
We can discuss whenever you are ready.

 Use Java 11 to run the stuff


[07/18/2022 11:31 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I like them both. I would recommend you to start implementing the mockups before doing more mockups to get a feeling for the efforts for some of the suggested changes. For example, moving the bottom nav items to the positions in the design is not possible with the system widgets, reimplementation of the bottom nav bar is needed to make it happen. Integrating a graph need to check out graph libraries and if they support skinning etc


[07/18/2022 1:26 PM] üçÄTheZiküáØüá≤#5382
There are several options for how we can proceed:

1. I can slightly change an existing design.  Change colors, slightly change the location of the buttons, place information more informatively.  

2. I make a new design and we work together.  To adapt the design and implement it into the code.

Once again I want to say that I am not a developer, I am a designer, so for my part I can only provide layouts. Tell me what do you think and we can proceed.


[07/18/2022 7:05 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
We had a discussion in the general channel yesterday, that's basically what I've said:

For me, I'll focus on the actual functionality and that the wallet app works smooth, that's why I am using system-provided UI in the first place.  The system UIs are provided by the operating systems to get a UI done without spending efforts for building UI elements, but just use them. In my experiences, not using them drives up efforts depending on what is needed a lot. I don't have time to do that. If someone is willing to overhaul the iOS UI and does a PR, I'll gladly review it and merge it (when it works for all situations).


[07/18/2022 9:21 PM] üçÄTheZiküáØüá≤#5382
People eat with their eyes, so if a product looks more attractive, they will want to use it. The wallet is the first thing the user interact with when joining the ecosystem. In any case, if you ever want to change the design, I will be glad to participate üôÇ
Also, if someone wants to help me with the code and do the PR I‚Äôm ready to work on the design and we can make the wallet more attractive üôÇ

 Another thought, you might reach out to Frosty of AnetaBTC. They are forking the mobile wallet to add functionality and change the design a bit. They might have someone that can code the design that can then be rolled back into the original wallet.

@Frostyausty


[07/19/2022 6:50 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
And yet another thought, maybe minotaur is also a thing to reach out to. Their ui is a non-native web UI and might be more easy to tweak

 I totally agree with you. It‚Äôs not that I will not use a less beautiful product which offers more benefits; but - I will always prefer a better looking product. Intuitively- the beauty of the UI also says to me something about the quality of the product. Think apple or dyson. Good looks says good design.


[07/19/2022 8:43 AM] koutelier#0000
$COMET Team will for mobile wallets to change the UI maybe we could make a comet one work with you for the new design

It's my "second language". Even with 330 million speakers, it's probably not enough of a problem for the bot creators to worry about yet.

Is this the proper channel for a wallet mishap. sent my ergo to the private key extension instead of the regular address and lost the ergo. But Iv been told it‚Äôs recoverable. Just no one has told me how yet. Keep hitting a road block and then that person doesn‚Äôt answer(on Reddit) I posted in developer here and was told to post it here.


[07/23/2022 8:48 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
It is the right channel. Already answered on Reddit. Since the transaction was never executed, you should ask the tradeogre support to refund


[07/24/2022 12:54 AM] AMD780#4603
Thank you. I did t know which support to contact. I appreciate the help.

For now you can use an offline Android or desktop device as a cold wallet

 I find it very satisfying to do my regular vesting claims using the offline capability.
There's something about that very subtle "beep" when scanning the QR code.

Any chance of nested transactions support? Ergopad supports it now but it doesn't work with the mobile wallet.

 It is unfortunately depending on an issue of explorer that I already opened an issue for some time ago.
Just checked seems to be resolved without a notice will try


[07/29/2022 4:02 PM] Flying Pig#0000
Cool, I'll try tonight as well. Hopefully i don't need to update the app on my offline device since i try to keep that squeeky clean and not connect it to any other device.

 You can also transfer apks, either via USB or Bluetooth with something like F-Droid.


[07/29/2022 4:07 PM] Flying Pig#0000
I actually just disconnect the internet and transfer via usb to from my "safe" laptop.
Works great and probably very secure and unlikely anyone has tampered with it.

I've not updated the offline app in months and since it only signs transactions i would think it doesn't need to be updated.

@Deleted User May I ask where did you get the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cold wallet to sign transactions? It seems to me one of the best features that your wallet has and that any wallet can have, however I do not know of other wallets with this feature. Only Bitcoin's Electrum which has something similar, but the wallet is quite ugly. It would be great to have this feature in a Cardano wallet. Congratulations for the app, I have tried many different wallets of different currencies and it is the best!

Hi, i noticed when i scan the signed QR codes from my cold device to my hot device in order to send a transaction, the ui in the hot device do not show the number of qr scanned. i mean, when i scan the qr to sign form the hot device to the cold device it shows in the cold device the number of current QR scanned and how much the total are in a format of qrnumber/totalqrcodes , when i scan the signed qr codes it does not show that info on the hot device who is scaning them but all works fine you scan all of them and it send the transaction perfectly, its only an "visual/ui" issue


[08/09/2022 9:39 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
on ios or on android?


[08/09/2022 9:43 PM] uli.pkm#0359
as a suggestion, my cold device is old and the display is not the best, when i started using the cold device had trouble to scan the signed qrs because the qr codes was "high resolution" to scan from that old display, i realised there was a button in the upper right corner wich  give you the same with in "low resolution" qr codes wich work perfect, i feel like it is not much intuitive/clear and it would be better if it (the button) is better pointed


[08/09/2022 9:44 PM] uli.pkm#0359
in android


[08/09/2022 9:45 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I agree, but using a big buton with text is not really good in my opinion. the pictogram was the best I've found (although it is far from perfect). do you have any specific suggestions?


[08/09/2022 9:46 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
I will check. I am not sure anymore if it is not integrated, which could be because it is less likely for the route back that many qr codes are needed

Hello. Having trouble signing a tokenjay transaction to buy sigusd from cold wallet‚Ä¶ am i doing this right?
- build tx on tokenjay.app

But it doesn‚Äôt recognise the qr code.

Any ideas?

I've never had problems signing with the cold wallet. The only problem is doing it fast enough. I also think the bank only does one transaction per block.

(re @cafebedouin : *I've never had problems signing with the cold wallet. The only problem is doing it fast enough. I also think the bank only does one transaction per block.*) 
 
 Do you sign directly on the pc with the cold wallet, or do you use an ‚Äúonline‚Äù mobile device in the middle?

 At the top right of the qr code is a small icon. If you tap it, it will lower the resolution of the qr code.

Have discovered something i believe its not supossed to, when was restoring a wallet of 24 words seed phrase i made a mistake and wrote wrong a word, when taped on restore it said me that they were invalid words, checked it and didnt realised where was the error, tap again and it acepted it like all was right and display the adress but i noticed that didnt match with the adress of that seed, so i go back check again carefully and noticed i missed a letter on one word.

Hi @MrStahlfelge some feedback for you. As mentioned i had some trouble scanning SC transaction using cold wallet QR code method.

I have now done it, but I had to use the 8x low-resolution barcodes - quite cumbersome and it takes some time to get the focus right.

My concern is that the device is not particularly old - a Samsung galaxy S20 FE (12MP camera).  Using my ‚Äúhot‚Äù wallet device (iphone 12) going back the other way the code scans instantly.

(re @Gazza_SP : *Might be worth loading a qr code scanner APK onto the cold device, the inbuilt one on Samsung is shit*) 
 
 Update on this. Played around with it more - Normal p2p transactions are easy & work quickly without problems.

The issues are with p2s transactions. I can get it to work with some difficulty on some ergopad transactions, but some don‚Äôt work at all (eg staking transaction).

So i think it has more to do with how the qr code is generated than the quality of the camera/software - but i could be wrong.

Has anyone else had issues using cold wallet with staking transactions?


[08/13/2022 12:59 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
p2s addresses contain the whole smart contract and are much longer than p2pk addresses, so QR code has to hold much more content for such addresses.

(re @MrStahlfelge : *p2s addresses contain the whole smart contract and are much longer than p2pk addresses, so QR code has to hold much more content for such addresses.*) 
 
 Makes sense - thanks. I guess i will just have to send tokens back to a hot wallet for staking transactions for now.

If you find a scanner app that works better that would be interesting for me. There are different libraries to scan qr codes around for Android. I went with the one that is most popular, but there might be others around that have better detection rate. Or maybe the built in camera app has a better detection as well by using the hardware.

 I tried side loading a QR code app and a different camera app but it didn‚Äôt seem to make a difference. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because the Samsung software is so locked down (can‚Äôt change default camera app)?

 I think I‚Äôve figured out that it‚Äôs a specific issue with this generation of samsung software - it looks for a large area of white around the qr code and won‚Äôt read unless it finds this

yes, that's true. the margin is a silence zone. thinking about it, are you using an ipone in dark mode as hot device?

Yes!

[08/15/2022 10:01 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
it is indeed a good point. the iphones do not generate the silence zone because they don't need it to scan. I will open an issue on the repo and will try to find out if there are parameters to set to make them use it or if I have to make a white margin

[08/18/2022 3:37 AM] uli.pkm#0359
i kept thinking about and had an idea wich could be good without changing the current pictogram or ui. my idea is if you can detect that the phone is trying to read a qr code and fails a few times in a row, then a message might pop up suggesting try less dense qr codes and showing the pictogram, this way will learn and directly do next time


[08/18/2022 4:49 AM] cafebedouin#0000
(re  : *<GarbageGamer> I'm trying to send a transaction from my cold wallet device and scan the QR code on my readonly online device*) 
 
 Works the other way. You do the transaction in the read-only hot wallet. It will give a QR code for your cold wallet to scan. You sign the transaction. Then scan the QR again with the signed transaction with the hot wallet.


[08/18/2022 7:59 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
it is a good idea but some more effort to do. currently I am not presenting an own scanner screen but a predefined one that can't get changed. showing hints would mean to implement an own scanning screen dealing with camera etc. I will look into it

Every token is shown now with its current value on Spectrum.Dex - can the wallet show the value of NFTs (e.g. average for the tier)?

 I just imagine there is (or could be) some database you could go to‚Ä¶ at least for Neta (angels) NFTs you could look at SkyHarbor

I imagine that such DB would be easy with Azorus


[08/20/2022 6:55 AM] cafebedouin#0000
Like Spectrum, the wallet would need an api. Clearly skyharbor has information on "floor price" and "previous sales" but I don't know if they are making the information accessible via an api.


[08/20/2022 6:56 AM] odiseus_me#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *Like Spectrum, the wallet would need an api. Clearly skyharbor has information on "floor price" and "previous sales" but I don't know if they are making the information accessible via an api.*) 
 
 Agreed. I just think it‚Äôs a useful piece of information that future wallet users would appreciate.


[08/20/2022 6:56 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I can integrate other price sources if they provide an API. Best is if you contact skyharbor about it.
That said, hard to determine the price for an NFT before selling


[08/20/2022 6:56 AM] cafebedouin#0000
@HazeyOneKenobi is a price api available from skyharbor?


[08/20/2022 6:56 AM] cafebedouin#0000
I don't know if I can @ someone in a channel they aren't in.

(re @MrStahlfelge : *I can integrate other price sources if they provide an API. Best is if you contact skyharbor about it.

 Clearly - floor price, or purchase price, until one is sold.

Azorus on my question of NFT prices


[08/20/2022 9:12 AM] odiseus_me#0000
Forwarded from curbsideprophetz: it would definitely be possible. depends on where/how you currently find that data. for example, if skyharbor/AH comes up with their own backend it's an easy integration for us and someone can write to that data and join with TX data.

Is it possible to add a specific derived address in the wallet app? Mobile wallet doesnt show the address that I have set on Nautilus as a default address and adding more addresses just seems to generate new ones.


[08/22/2022 9:49 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
the derived addresses are indexed, starting with 0. wallet app always uses index 0 as the main address, and derive new addresses with incrementing indices. I would suspect nautilus is doing the same, using random indices would be very weird


[08/22/2022 9:53 AM] Sayos#7465
Hmm, so if I just keep on adding the addresses it should eventually pop up


[08/22/2022 9:54 AM] Sayos#7465
If so, there are some place for ux improvement since then I'd have dozens of empty addresses in the app that I should remove one by one. Is it possible to add a functionality for the wallet to iterate through the addresses and show every address that has balance greater than zero?


[08/22/2022 9:57 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
the use case for using derived addresses in the wallet app is different than on nautilus. nautilus uses it to add privacy. in wallet app, addresses are a way to organize your funds. For example your funds acquired in a certain year, or from a certain pool, etc. it is meant to add addresses on purpose, and not in masses


[08/22/2022 9:58 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
that's why you can exactly specify which address is used when you send funds or interact with ergopay


[08/22/2022 10:00 AM] Sayos#7465
Sure, that sounds logical. But even so, if you do use nautilus on desktop and mobile in parallel you can end up in situation where your mobile wallet shows zero balance since nautilus has generated a new default address.


[08/22/2022 10:01 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
true, but if the newly generated address is not the next one, I would ask nautilus how the new address is derived and if there is a way to just use the next index. this is the easiest for all and does not put the users in the situation to look for their funds


[08/22/2022 10:02 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
one time there comes the situation that you have to restore your wallet and if the addresses are on random indices, there is no way to find them


[08/22/2022 10:16 AM] RondyETH#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *You can use Spectrum with SAFEW browser extension as a read only, and sign the transaction with Ergo Mobile Wallet.*) 
 
 Thanks buddy, i appreciate it


[08/22/2022 10:42 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
Maybe nautilus can show the index of the address so you can know for sure what it is

{Reactions}
üëç 

[08/22/2022 11:18 AM] Sayos#7465
That could be one solution, but then there should be a way to add an address using a specific index without the need of adding all addresses in between


[08/22/2022 11:21 AM] Sayos#7465
I suppose, but in these cases it'd be helpful to automatically add the addresses that already contain funds/assets to the view. 

And maybe if you want to add/use a specific derived address you could select it from a list of the indexed addresses rather than yet again, having to iterate through every address to find it.

(re @ShelbyZR1 : *I guess if it's confirmed in the blockchain, it's bye-bye funds, right?*) 
 
 Correct. The question is to figure out how it happened. Did someone have access to your device? Did you leave the seed out on paper? Did you type it into a website? These are the normal routes funds get compromised.


[08/22/2022 7:25 PM] ShelbyZR1#0000
Phone with me all the time
The paper copy is in my desk(secure)
The only time I used my seed phrase was when I opened my mobile wallet because yoroi on my desktop was always giving me problems...

 Explain please...newbie here


[08/23/2022 5:35 AM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @ShelbyZR1 : *Explain please...newbie here*) 
 
 I actually confused myself. I was looking at the previous transactions in the wallet it was sent to, which appear to have had the previous balance piped through the mixer. the transaction from your wallet is still in there. But, there have only been three transactions in that wallet. The first sat in the wallet for six weeks and then was piped through the mixer, which is a way to obfuscate where the Erg came from.


[08/23/2022 12:07 PM] odiseus_me#0000
Would it be possible to split the Details ‚Äútab‚Äù to two?: one which will be *tokens* and beneath it *transactions* ? I rarely look for the two together; I either check my wallet to see which transactions went through, or check for the balance of my tokens; right now, when I press Details I always get information that I do not need/look at.


[08/23/2022 12:12 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
you can collapse the tokens view, it is remembered per wallet. transactions is always restricted to the last 5.
I thought about using two columns on tablets, but this introduces new challenges

 Actually collapsing the tokens view is great, my wallet looks smarter now and I am happy.

Gave up waiting on official iOS release. So installed Test flight. Great wallet, although the red hurts my eyes a bit and the token icons would be cool

Is there road map for mixing?


[08/24/2022 9:06 AM] HelixEvo#2120
Is ergo pay the qr code thing?


[08/24/2022 9:12 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
mixing will never be part of the app itself due to legal problems. the mixer developers can write a plugin themselves though

yes you can use ergo pay on tokenjay.app or here are some showcase examples https://golfgl.de/ergopayshowcase/
ergopad also supports it


[08/24/2022 9:15 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
qr codes are not necessarily needed, you can use it on the same device

[08/24/2022 1:26 PM] navip#4838
@MrStahlfelge will it be possible in future to sort transactions by date asc/desc. I think it sorts them now latest at the top. But the thing is I have one tx that got doubled, one went through one is left in submit status and always at the top of tx list and will not go away


[08/24/2022 1:28 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
it will go away, it is set to cancelled after some while and then will eventually slide down.
or you can reset the list by going scrolling down completely and tap the download all button
sorting descending is not really possible with the current version of explorer api


[08/24/2022 1:49 PM] navip#4838
I think I messed up something when sending. I have exact same tx in canceled state minute after this one that is stuck in  submitted status. This was 9 days ago.
I will reset the list.


[08/24/2022 2:04 PM] navip#4838
I really like cold wallet option. For people having old phones lying around it is no brainer. Sending few erg your way. Had to dig your donation address from git. Just want you to stay with it and keep developing this wallet.  Will be one of a kind in crypto space one day. Probably is right now

@MrStahlfelge apologies if this has already been asked, but when might we see the mosaik sigusd/directly in app on ios?


[08/25/2022 10:08 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
no problem to ask more than once. :)
My sort order for the different platforms is the following: Android - Desktop - Web - iOS.
This due to the following facts: Android has the most users. Desktop can reuse Android code. Web because ever platform can use it. iOS last because less users. But it will come. As said, Web can be used. You can visit tokenjay.app/app/#ageusd to make the swap, it can interact with the app

 Nice one. It‚Äôs 100% a convenience item so happy to wait, but it‚Äôs an awesome feature to have - perhaps when nipopows are more developed one might be able to interact directly with the blockchain sans api/external node?

a node will always be needed, but I hope one day it can be done without explorer api

Explorer is unreliable again at the moment, try again later


[08/26/2022 1:44 AM] cafebedouin#0000
Added tokenjay.app to the dApps. Your Token Sales and the Purchase tokens button gives the error:  "This app needs a Mosaik executor capable running Mosaik apps version 1 Please check for an update to your application or use the website." Wallet 2.0.2214.

Probablty could change the error message to: "This app needs a Mosaik executor capable of running Mosaik apps version 1. Please check for an update to your application or use the website." as well.


[08/26/2022 7:07 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Will improve the message.

It is correct, 2214 runs Mosaik version 0 and escrow service app needs some features of version 1 which comes with 2215. The web version is already updated though.

Will post here when 2215 is released to beta

Might need some kind of functionality to remove dApps. Right now they all fit on the screen, but if Spectrum does a version. it might get to be a lot and people tend to trade a more limited set of tokens.

Tried several times - doesn't work. How to fix ?


[08/27/2022 1:05 AM] TypoDaPsycho#6307
@MrStahlfelge have you considered rebranding/ or renaming your Ergo wallet? Especially with desktop version coming . Seems like a good time for a big rebrand, or just a simple name change...

 What is the missing part? Of the message.

Chances are high that you have to many boxes on your address. In the first error message is stated that already 340 boxes were collected. This is too much for a single transaction anyway, keep it restricted to around 100.

 Yes, when I split a 1k transaction into two of 500 erg each, it worked.  Incoming were 5-6 erg x many. I think this feature should be described in faq, because it's absolutely not obvious thing and seems that default node or some functionality does not work.

 How many inputs did these transactions have? 
Node has a costing cap that is the reason for this, but I don't know where exactly the threshold is

(re @MrStahlfelge : *How many inputs did these transactions have?

 There should be about 100-130 inputs per one 500 ergo transaction


[08/27/2022 8:29 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I also figured 100 is a good threshold to use

[08/27/2022 2:47 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Yes, just make sure to have not too little payouts or consolidate from time to time to not have too many unspent boxes


[08/27/2022 2:48 PM] WHALE#9260
Okayy


[08/27/2022 2:48 PM] WHALE#9260
So big payouts maybe monthly are fine right ?


[08/27/2022 2:58 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Sure, weekly is good to. See a transaction can have up to around 100 input boxes. So you should not have more than 100 payouts between sending to exchange or consolidating

Might try using light mode or different QR scanning software. If you are trying to buy SigmaUSD, sometimes signing with a cold wallet isn't fast enough.

Any plans to make the Ergo Mobile Wallet interactive with dapps (Skyharbor, Spectrum etc)?


[08/30/2022 10:29 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
the plugin system is currently under heavy developement and already ships with the android version for users to try and developers to start working on it. currently, the only productive dapp using this plugin system is tokenjay.app (as it is my own demonstration project)

apart from the plugin system, the mobile app can interact with dApps with ergopay. this works on ios as well, you can try it on tokenjay of course, ergopad and ergosapiens did also implement it.


[08/30/2022 11:49 AM] kaktus#1810

Honestly, haven't put much thought towards a specific name. Something that isn't just "Ergo Wallet", is memorable , and can work well for both the mobile and desktop versions.

@bennyk2 how do you change the node your wallet points to?  I'm using nautilus and the official ergo mobile wallet.  Both sends are failing.

What is your problem sending ERG


[08/31/2022 5:58 PM] IncrementalWisdom#6648
@MrStahlfelge Starting yesterday, I was no longer able to send ERG using nautilus.  It would say the transaction was successful, but would never show up on Ergo Explorer ("Transaction with this ID was not found, or it has not entered Mempool yet)".   I thought maybe something was down on nautilus, so I installed the Ergo's official mobile wallet and tried to send my ERG with it instead.  However when I send ERG with the official mobile app I get a long error that includes words such as "Could not send transaction" "Error executing AP request" "Error 400" "Reason: Bad Request" "Detail: Malformed transaction"  "has too high cost".   I even tried to send to a different destination address, but still have the same problems with both wallets.  None of these issues started until yesterday. Any ideas???


[08/31/2022 6:08 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I already said too many input boxes. You need to send less at once

(re @Tchitombam : *My hot wallet, an iOS

 I think the wallet building the transaction, which would be Android in this case, needs to be the hot wallet.


[09/03/2022 7:59 AM] cafebedouin#0000
You could use the tokenjay website, scan on iPhone, then sign with android.


[09/03/2022 7:59 AM] AHMED#0000
is it safe ? that I read it expire in about 2 months


[09/03/2022 8:01 AM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @AHMED : *is it safe ? that I read it expire in about 2 months*) 
 
 It's the same code as on Android. It's only in Beta on iPhone because they require a DUNS number to officially list an app.


[09/03/2022 8:02 AM] cafebedouin#0000
I have used it for months. I've done multiple transactions using the new dapps feature. It all works great. @MrStahlfelge  is awesome.


[09/03/2022 8:03 AM] AHMED#0000
I feel it is with low security that no 2 FA enabled feature in it


[09/03/2022 8:05 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
It is 2fa


[09/03/2022 8:06 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
First factor: possession of device it is set up on
Second factor depending on your choice: you with your biometrics or knowledge (password you've given)

Always two factors needed to access


[09/03/2022 8:37 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000

(re @koutelier : *Same wallet but because ergo foundation can‚Äôt sort things out with Apple and publish it zen gate did*) 
 
 Well, it requires a DUNS number, which means you are a business. Easy for a business to get one, not so easy for a foundation or an individual.

@MrStahlfelge i discovered that using an iOS wallet device and android as cold storage, sometimes there is issues scanning the QR code - i realize this is a known bug between the two OS wallet versions, but may have discovered a workaround:

It appears that if you begin scaning the QR code where the code is sideways (rotated 90 clockwise or 90 ccw from the correct 'upright' orientation) and if you turn the code 90 degrees while it is located in the barcode scanning area of the phone camera, the QR reader seems to pick it up.


[09/03/2022 5:09 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
It should be better with iOS 2.0.2215

Hi..
I wonder how much it cost sending ergo to another wallets?


[09/03/2022 5:41 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
(re @AHMED : *Hi..

 0.0011 ERG minimum


[09/03/2022 5:44 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @AHMED : *Hi..

 But, if it is your wallet using sat Nautilus or Ergo Mobile Wallet, you can just restore the seed


[09/03/2022 5:59 PM] odiseus_me#0000
@MrStahlfelge is there a way to migrate the wallet/s from the TestFlight app to the newly released Terminus (rather than create from seed on Terminus)


[09/03/2022 6:00 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *@MrStahlfelge is there a way to migrate the wallet/s from the TestFlight app to the newly released Terminus (rather than create from seed on Terminus)*) 
 
 Only by restoring from seed unfortunately. The app is published by another developer and apps can't access data from other apps


[09/03/2022 6:00 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
That's the security mobile systems grant


[09/03/2022 6:02 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Terminus is a good name. Makes me think of the Helsinki Bus Station theory.


[09/03/2022 6:16 PM] elazor#0115
There‚Äôs an option in the app to copy the seed. I just downloaded terminus then copied seed to clipboard(from ergo wallet test flight) ‚Ä¶ then pasted into the new terminus app‚Ä¶ confirmed then deleted ergo wallet test flight version


[09/03/2022 6:17 PM] elazor#0115

 Payouts do not happen until confirmed.


[09/03/2022 6:32 PM] AHMED#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *Payouts do not happen until confirmed.*) 
 
 So it depend on which item? See that ( unconfirmef = 0.149) & ( pending balance = 0.517)


[09/03/2022 6:33 PM] AHMED#0000
On which number I expect my payments?


[09/03/2022 6:34 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Pending balance is probably both confirmed and unconfirmed. If you subtract out the unconfirmed, you are below threshold. Here's how it looks on GetBlok

 Depends on your needs. For mobile, Ergo Mobile Wallet on Android and Terminus on Apple.

[09/04/2022 7:58 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Looks like there are many unspent boxes on the address and explorer API has problems trying to find the box containing a token.
Recommended consolidating the boxes and now we need someone with a good explanation what that means :-)


[09/04/2022 8:24 PM] gytis_ivaskevicius#0000
or just step by step guide how to 'consolidate boxes' :D


[09/04/2022 8:26 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Send some erg to yourself. The error message indicates you have more than 350 boxes. So to get around 100 consolidated, send your balance / 3.5 to yourself.

Are you a miner with a small payout?


[09/04/2022 8:27 PM] gytis_ivaskevicius#0000
yeah


[09/04/2022 8:27 PM] gytis_ivaskevicius#0000
i sent 100 erg to myself, now that it got confirmed trying a proper transaction


[09/04/2022 8:27 PM] gytis_ivaskevicius#0000
we will see how many boxes are left


[09/04/2022 8:28 PM] gytis_ivaskevicius#0000
offset=260

(re @MrStahlfelge : *Send some erg to yourself. The error message indicates you have more than 350 boxes. So to get around 100 consolidated, send your balance / 3.5 to yourself.

 We need the explorer to start being able for large box amount wallets, with UTXO people will always have a huge amount over time unless consolidation is done regularly


[09/04/2022 8:28 PM] gytis_ivaskevicius#0000
i guess ill send myself 260erg?


[09/04/2022 8:28 PM] gytis_ivaskevicius#0000
that should fix it, right?


[09/04/2022 8:28 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
(re @gytis_ivaskevicius : *i guess ill send myself 260erg?*) 
 
 Basically you need to try make a few transactions that include all your assets, this will convert possibly hundreds of boxes into a small few


[09/04/2022 8:29 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
Then the wallet can read easily


[09/04/2022 8:33 PM] gytis_ivaskevicius#0000
i cant send it to myself now :/


[09/04/2022 8:33 PM] gytis_ivaskevicius#0000
will try it again in a while


[09/04/2022 8:34 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
(re @Gazza_SP : *We need the explorer to start being able for large box amount wallets, with UTXO people will always have a huge amount over time unless consolidation is done regularly*) 
 
 It would help if the explorer was just not unreliable as heck. Every now and then it times out without a reason. The more requests needed the more probability of an action not succeeding


[09/04/2022 8:34 PM] gytis_ivaskevicius#0000
what db is being used there anyways? sounds like a super simple query


[09/04/2022 8:35 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
(re @gytis_ivaskevicius : *what db is being used there anyways? sounds like a super simple query*) 
 
 It is a PostgreSQL but that can't be the problem.
It is planned to add the functionality to the node so that there is no centralized component any more


[09/04/2022 8:36 PM] gytis_ivaskevicius#0000
well api is centralized anyways, it might as well use db as a cache


[09/04/2022 8:36 PM] gytis_ivaskevicius#0000
and you guys sure that there are no indexes lacking? üòÖ


[09/04/2022 8:36 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
It is more a problem that one of the instances seem to struggle


[09/04/2022 8:37 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
It is random if you get a very fast response or a timeout


[09/04/2022 8:38 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è yeah I think it could be better, but this is what we have. Hope the node will have the capability to do it anytime soon, will switch the wallet asap then


[09/04/2022 8:43 PM] gytis_ivaskevicius#0000
just curious, how is ergo as a company doing? You guys seem to have no job offers so I assume it's in the stage of just a couple of nerds hacking on it? How many if that's not a secret?


[09/04/2022 8:55 PM] elazor#0115
Take a look at the ergo foundation page. Sheds a bit of light on who is involved if you scroll down. But there are obviously other developers not listed.

(re  : *<elazor> Sounds like your mostly trolling, but you‚Äôll need some sort of derivative to short. There is an ergo project that will help you achieve this.  #tensile*) 
 
 You can buy SigmaUSD, which works like a short, e.g. you buy SigUSD at $5 and sell at $2.5, you've doubled your Erg, minus 4% to cover transactions.

So many things to appreciate about this amazing wallet but one question, how on earth does it display a pending tx INSTANTLY after submission and LONG before it was even registered on the Ergo Explorer?!?


[09/06/2022 1:14 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
because it saves it as submitted when it submits it


[09/06/2022 1:31 PM] Storyoflight23#0000

Yes

100% sure

Since i use for crypto


[09/06/2022 1:34 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
the app can only show what the operating system tells it.
in any case, you can get it back to work by restoring from mnemonic


[09/06/2022 1:35 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
but this error usually means something changed with the device credentials. Android invalidates everything stored with biometrics then.


[09/06/2022 1:35 PM] Storyoflight23#0000
I did an ios update recently


[09/06/2022 1:35 PM] Storyoflight23#0000
Maybe has to do with it

Anyway thanks for fast answers


[09/06/2022 1:36 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
system update could make this happen if they changed anything on the biometrics. it should not but manufacturers might handle that differently.


[09/06/2022 1:39 PM] Storyoflight23#0000
I deleted my face data


[09/06/2022 1:39 PM] Storyoflight23#0000
And use finger only


[09/06/2022 1:39 PM] Storyoflight23#0000
And it worked


[09/06/2022 1:40 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
interesting. the phone might handle face recognition as not secure enough


[09/06/2022 1:40 PM] Storyoflight23#0000
well it worked before like that


[09/06/2022 1:40 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
yes, but they could have changed that with the update. maybe they thought that their technique is safe before

 You have to either enter a wallet-specific password, enter in the password to unlock your device to sign a transaction or sign it using a different phone and QR codes, what would locking the app do that isn't already being done?


[09/07/2022 4:25 AM] cafebedouin#0000
I guess there's the issue of displaying the values of the wallet.


[09/07/2022 4:25 AM] cafebedouin#0000
But, if you are letting someone else use your phone, you can always pin that app.

[09/07/2022 7:29 AM] Tchitombam#0000
Ok guys, feedback:

1. When u change ur Ergo Node URL (image above), there is 3 options. Everytime u press the little wand the next option comes up. Save and retry a tx but it may not work on the first attempt even with the correct option selected (for me it was the "https://ergo-node.zoomout.io/")

2. Scan doesnt work in high res, even on light mode if iOS hot device. U need to do low rez for a tx to go thru

That said, cant stress enough, this is an amazing, truly decentralized, super secure, private cold wallet


[09/07/2022 7:33 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
High res depends on camera


[09/07/2022 7:34 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
The error you got above is because too many time went by between the creation of the transaction and the submission of the signed one. Nothing to do with the node

 Aha, no need to amend on the Node URL field?


[09/07/2022 8:57 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
(re @Tchitombam : *Aha, no need to amend on the Node URL field?*) 
 
 no, in case of ageusd it is usually that someone else made a bank transaction in the meantime or the oracle posted a new rate.
The hint with the node in the error message is generic because such things could also be caused by a node that is not synced.


[09/07/2022 8:59 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
so AgeUSD transfer and cold wallet is something to be very fast. I heard some people do it and you eventually managed it as well, but unfortunately the more you wait for the exchange the more probable it is to fail.
TokenJay prints out a little warning in the hints at the top when there is already a new oracle rate waiting in mempool. When that happens you really have to submit immediately or wait some more and refresh


[09/07/2022 11:06 AM] Tchitombam#0000
Got u thanks. I was immediate but i do understand how transactions can still interfere or rates change while ur scanning


[09/07/2022 11:11 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
actually by exactly reading the error it is clear that the oracle rate changed (it says all DATA inputs have to be utxo, and the oracle is the only data input)

 Use a cold wallet for signing.


[09/07/2022 6:32 PM] RelatXX1#0000
This is what I am going to do, to buy ERG on an exchange and move it to my Ledger or Trezor wallet.


[09/07/2022 6:33 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Have an old phone? This wallet allows to use it to sign. Keep it somewhere safe. Sign transactions with it. Carry the read only wallet in your pocket.


[09/07/2022 6:34 PM] cafebedouin#0000
By all means use Ledger, when it is supported. Right now, you have to sideload on a few models. Trezor doesn't support Ergo.

There's a password for my authenticator app, same idea.

It is open source. I wonder if some code could be easily ported that way.

*the feature request is there so will be done eventually. technically absolutely doable, although a bit hacky because the mobile SDKs do not support it out of the box probably because of the same reason.

(re @MrStahlfelge : *you can find it on app store when searching for terminus*) 
 
 A silly question. If you add a read-only wallet, then decide you want to restore the same wallet with keys, adding that wallet just replaces the read-only wallet? It looks it did, but I thought I'd ask to confirm.


[09/10/2022 1:51 AM] cafebedouin#0000

Is it possible to add derived cold wallet addresses to the same read only wallet? Or would each derived cold wallet address have to be displayed via it's own read only wallet?

(re @theta_decay : *Is it possible to add derived cold wallet addresses to the same read only wallet? Or would each derived cold wallet address have to be displayed via it's own read only wallet?*) 
 
 I think read only is by address.

But, good question

(re @theta_decay : *Is it possible to add derived cold wallet addresses to the same read only wallet? Or would each derived cold wallet address have to be displayed via it's own read only wallet?*) 
 
 You can add the wallet via its extended public key. Then you can derive addresses even for read onlys

 it is on mobile, that's what his use case is. I think it is valid that some people just want to hold erg and are not interested in more features. just not the target audience of wallet app which is to showcase what ergo is capable of


[09/12/2022 9:30 AM] bennyk2#0000
Ok just found zelcore on ios app store - one thing I find strange is that it only requires you to put in your ‚Äúlogin‚Äù and ‚Äúpassword‚Äù (twice strangely) to restore your wallet on a new device.

This makes me think it‚Äôs a custodial wallet as there‚Äôs no seed phrase/mnemonic required. 

Is this accurate?

 Zelcore doesn‚Äôt work with Dex 
It works on both OS for cell
It‚Äôs not a cold but it‚Äôs very secure and has d2FA
BUT now you can hold ERC20 tokens including FLUX and KDA and has some parallel assets

 Yeah that convenience factor is pretty big for a lot of people- i definitely get that!


[09/12/2022 9:35 AM] bennyk2#0000
I think any successful crypto ecosystem has numerous wallet options as everyone wants different things out of them. Now that we have more options it‚Äôs definitely a good thing!

But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to replace the ergo mobile wallet app / terminus any time soon.


[09/12/2022 9:35 AM] Resist_Defy_Prevail#0000
In time I‚Äôd say it will connect to Dex as it connects to KDA Dex‚Äôs


[09/12/2022 9:38 AM] Resist_Defy_Prevail#0000
It‚Äôs like ATM Zel holds KDA NFT but you can‚Äôt view them. More features will come in time

Does the mobile wallet support chained transactions now? 
Specifically for the offline part


[09/13/2022 2:49 PM] FlyingPig_69#0000
Just read the updates...and it seems it now does. Time to update the cold wallet :)


[09/13/2022 2:49 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
chained are supported for a long time, it was only missing for ergopay


[09/13/2022 2:50 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
you don't need to upgrade the cold part, it only signs the transaction. the hot part builds it


[09/13/2022 3:01 PM] FlyingPig_69#0000
DIdn't work though...."error executing APi request....."


[09/13/2022 3:02 PM] FlyingPig_69#0000
(I have a bunch of keys in my cold wallets so wanted to send all transactions in one go...rather than wait for each tx to be confirmed)


[09/13/2022 3:03 PM] FlyingPig_69#0000
Does ergopad need to update something on their end for this to work?


[09/13/2022 3:04 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000

2217


[09/13/2022 3:04 PM] FlyingPig_69#0000

got it! I did just execute the transaction again which now worked.


[09/13/2022 3:07 PM] FlyingPig_69#0000
still want it or should I wait to next time i try a chained tx?


[09/13/2022 3:08 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
still want it. that it worked now is normal because it is not chained any more when the first one got confirmed. :)


[09/13/2022 3:08 PM] FlyingPig_69#0000
(when say it worked, it's because previous TX was confirmed....chained still didnbt work)

DMd iot


[09/13/2022 3:10 PM] theta_decay#0000
For chained tx's, doesn't the previous tx have to enter the mempool prior to signing the second tx? Or is that my misconception?


[09/13/2022 3:10 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
yes, it needs to be on the mempool.


[09/13/2022 4:03 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000

Sure there will b a period of consolidation that will give rise to the next cycle. Value, quality, they cant hide for too long

[09/14/2022 10:33 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
welcome. looks like you have the testflight version. you are good with that one, but there's already a version on App Store called "Terminus". It is the same app released by Zengate Global


[09/14/2022 10:34 AM] KingOfWarrr#0000
I see. So may I which one should I use? This one or Terminus?


[09/14/2022 10:35 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I would recommend Terminus since it is not time restricted and more easy to install. If you already set everything up in Ergo Wallet, there is no hurry to do it though. You can mine to the address and restore it in Terminus with your mnemonic


[09/14/2022 10:35 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
And what do you mean with a fee keeping your mining payout?


[09/14/2022 10:36 AM] KingOfWarrr#0000
Is it this? Can i use same password to login in this new terminus app?

[09/14/2022 10:37 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
it is this one, yes. you can restore with your mnemonic, the 15 words you noted when creating the wallet.


[09/14/2022 10:37 AM] KingOfWarrr#0000
(re @MrStahlfelge : *And what do you mean with a fee keeping your mining payout?*) 
 
 Just curious if theres any fee to use this wallet for every transaction send out & send in


[09/14/2022 10:38 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
(re @KingOfWarrr : *Just curious if theres any fee to use this wallet for every transaction send out & send in*) 
 
 ergo has a transaction fee of at least 0.001, that's it. the wallet is funded by Ergo Foundation so it does not keep anything from you. recommend you to join the general channel for general talk!

have fun, ergo has the best community around


[09/14/2022 10:40 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
and just another tip, don't set your pool payout too low. ergo is based on utxo model, so every payout is a box. a transaction can move around 100 boxes. so if you set your payout to 0.1, you can only move 10 erg at once.


[09/14/2022 10:41 AM] KingOfWarrr#0000

Is it possible that a tx is marked as "Pending" on the wallet without actually having been posted on the Ergo Explorer even after about 10 minutes?

[09/14/2022 5:00 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
when it is marked pending, it was in mempool. if it was removed from mempool it is shown as pending for some time because mempool is not 100% reliable, transactions can disappear and reappear.


[09/14/2022 5:01 PM] Erg0sphere#0000
Thanks. How long before its clear usually?


[09/14/2022 5:01 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
since it is an ageusd swap it is probably cancelled though, by another one doing the swap with a higher fee at the same time or oracle posting a new rate box


[09/14/2022 5:02 PM] Erg0sphere#0000
Yea looks like its bot going thru


[09/14/2022 5:02 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
(re @Erg0sphere : *Thanks. How long before its clear usually?*) 
 
 it is set to cancelled after more than 10 minutes, should happen now. you don't need to wait for it to try again


[09/14/2022 5:03 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
the ageusd bank made another swap at 6:52 your time with a fee of 0.03 so most likely that one bid you out


[09/14/2022 5:06 PM] Erg0sphere#0000
Do i have control over the fee from the mob wallet app?


[09/14/2022 5:07 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
there's a choose box below the "buy"/"sell" button


[09/14/2022 5:09 PM] Erg0sphere#0000
Ok, Great

this last attempt did go thru. As feedback my Android does not read the hi rez qr (light mode or dark). Could a better camera Android fix this?


[09/14/2022 5:10 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
will improve the situation but it won't work as smooth as iphone. the iphones have the decoding built into the hardware making best use of it


[09/14/2022 5:31 PM] Erg0sphere#0000
Got it

Last question. Why do different txs have different confirmation on the wallet? Is it just the difference btn a agusd protocol tx and a simple tx?

It is not only AgeUSD but any ergopay transaction that looks like the right one. For example staking on ergopad

 To update, you could delete the app, connect to the internet, download the new version, and go offline again.


[09/16/2022 10:14 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
The important thing is that you generate your wallet not before you put the device offline and that you never connect again

 Yes, but if there is anything that grabbed your mnemonic while being offline, it might have saved it itself and has the chance to send it to a bad actor when you go online.

You have to place the APK file in Downloads. Then on the phone go into the downloads app and start it. Cw made a tutorial video

No problem. Thing is, the different manufacturers do it a bit different. You seem to have a Xiaomi. Best is to search for tutorials how to sideload on your specific device


[09/16/2022 12:09 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Some devices don't recognize sideloaded files immediately for example, restart or waiting helps.

How does the offline device know to generate the correct QR code for a restored wallet, when it did not have reception after the Mob Wallet app was installed?


[09/16/2022 1:29 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
It is all calculated from your mnemonic

[09/16/2022 3:25 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Because you never have to connect the device and still be able to update. That's just more handy.

It is the Plugin system for ergo wallet apps.

 Not the oldest. Also, starting with Netscape means you missed the BBS era.

I would appreciate everyone waiting for changed balance notifications to jump on the test track and use this version as this feature was hard to test for me.

 Please explain


[09/25/2022 4:38 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Payouts only happen when you hit an threshold. If there hasn't been a payment, that's often the reason. The difficulty on Ergo is high right now, so there are fewer blocks, fewer rewards and fewer payments.

 You actually don't have to wait. Ergopad has a bot that stacks transactions. Seems to bork above 3 at a time though.

 It didn't work for offline/cold mobile wallet. I provided the debug info to Mr Stahlfelge and he fixed it last week.


[09/25/2022 8:05 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Yes chained with cold wallet and ergopay was not working

Try again. If it doesn't work, try a different node from this list. https://api.tokenjay.app/peers/list?unreachable=false&limit=50


[09/25/2022 8:52 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
That won't help, the message means that you try to spend a box that you can't spend. When does it happen?


[09/25/2022 8:53 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
It can't be a normal send tx, must be ergopay


[09/25/2022 9:15 PM] cafebedouin#0000

You need a small amount of erg on the address, 0.003 for the swap to work. 
The error message is not quite correct, need to fix it.


[09/26/2022 5:41 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Probably you have only 0.001 erg or have chosen the wrong address accidentally?

(re @malakmagdy666 : *Yes, or convert it to usdt and withdraw it to any wallet supported by the dollar*) 
 
 You cannot send erg to binance because they do not support it
You can change it to usdt in a few exchanges such as Gate, CoinEx or KuCoin


[09/28/2022 8:10 AM] MDMTXO#0000

ergo is not listed on Binance yet, so you cannot withdraw to binance, 

huobi

are your other best alternatives

[09/28/2022 1:02 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
You can only use 100 input boxes and your pool payout is 0.1. so you can only send in 10 erg chunks

 try sending 0.5 erg sir

So I can't sweep and need to leave something in it?


[09/28/2022 9:35 PM] theodork#3746
The utxo originally had 0.018 erg + tokens and I received the same error. So I sent 1 ERG to it and am now trying to essentially "send all"


[09/28/2022 9:37 PM] JOFLITO#0000
(re  : *<theodork> The utxo originally had 0.018 erg + tokens and I received the same error. So I sent 1 ERG to it and am now trying to essentially "send all"*) 
 
 IDK sir, my guess is that the fees are not being calculated right so you need more than what it says


[09/28/2022 9:37 PM] JOFLITO#0000
so if you had 0.18 or 100 and use send all you are having the same amount for fees


[09/28/2022 9:37 PM] JOFLITO#0000
but that is just a guess lol


[09/28/2022 9:56 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Do you have unconfirmed transactions outgoing? That would explain why your balance shows but nothing is available


[09/29/2022 1:10 AM] theodork#3746
No unconfirmed or outgoing txns. I did have a lot (~100) of derived address, a few of which had assets but would not even show in Nautilus.

 if notification is set to 1 hour , shouldn't the wallet sync every 1 hour ?


[09/29/2022 10:00 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
the background sync does not set the time stamp that is used to show that info because in background it does not sync all data, only what's necessary to know if balance changed


[09/29/2022 10:13 AM] MDMTXO#0000
ok will keep you updated if it works. also is it possible to add 30 min, or a way that user can choose whatever they like ?


[09/29/2022 10:18 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
android defines a minimum of 15 minutes, but giving that option would probably make users expect some immediate on time notification. it is important to understand what this background check is. to not drain the battery, it is a soft request to the system that the app wants to work every hour. android decides if battery and connection state are okay and will make the app work when it decides it is feasible to do so. for example, at night when the phone dozes, it will probably never run until your alarm wakes the device at the morning.
so it is more meant for users to not miss balance changes completely.

Hello!
With this question, you should contact the support team of your wallet and your pool.
Unfortunately, we are not involved in the exact configuration of users' equipment, overclocking, flight sheets, etc. I can only provide support on Hiveon's products and services.

If you need any help with these configurations, you can check out our community channels for advice.


[09/29/2022 11:33 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
You have to check if your pool made any payout

(re @MrStahlfelge : *Is the node synched and on the current block?*) 
 
 Yes and yes. Synced on 844267. I can make other txns with the same wallet, it is just that the three utxos holding ~1erg + tokens each are not "working" for some reason.

Hi, i lost my coins in my mobile wallet 2 days ago. Can i find out where does it actually go? Or am i missing something on the updates? Because my wallet isn't active from May this year (no transaction made) .

 What does "lost my coins" mean? You installed Ergo Mobile Wallet on Android. It worked. Then, two days ago, your wallet showed a zero balance?

 Transactions don't happen by themselves. Either you or someone else with access to your wallet initiated and authorized it.

 If there is a transaction that you didn't complete on your own, then I would suggest you secure your funds immediately in another wallet. However, if there is no transaction and some ERG is "missing" perhaps something else is going on.

it seems to be a problem on kucoin's end, many users complaining about it

 It likely just never actually occured since they are upgrading their node!


[10/01/2022 9:32 AM] FlyingPig_69#0000
I think they will wait until EIP37 has gone through. 
With block time being 10+ minutes tt looks like a lot of TXs are stuck and never get mined because miners/nodes select the ones with highest fees leaving some txs to never get mined.

At least that's what I've noticed, i've had a tx stuck for 2 days...:)


[10/01/2022 7:31 PM] odiseus_me#0000
Could you make the tx id clickable? It would help to see the tx on the explorer

 Normal send


[10/02/2022 3:37 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
(re @odiseus_me : *Normal send*) 
 
 it is clickable, just tap to get the share screen


[10/02/2022 3:40 PM] FlyingPig_69#0000
Agree with this, i'd rather it open directly in my browser than clicking share.
When you click share (at least on my phone) chrome doesn't come up as an option, just email, whatsapp and a few others.
i have to copy the URL and then paste manually in the browser


[10/02/2022 3:42 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
it is preference what is better. if I change it, probably others will say they can't share the link but have top open safari and copy from there :)


[10/02/2022 3:44 PM] FlyingPig_69#0000
Agree, preference is different depending on the user :)
I'd be happy to click share and then chrome, but chrome does not come up as an option when I click share. Maybe it's my phone


[10/02/2022 3:45 PM] FlyingPig_69#0000
I guess it's because the URL does have .html/l


[10/02/2022 3:49 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Interesting. Same here. It doesn't show my default browser, but it does show others I've installed, such as Duckduckgo, Tor, etc.

Question guys
Once a tx has been submitted by Wallet AND posted on the blockchain (orange tag), can it subsequently be rejected by system for whatever reason?


[10/02/2022 9:49 PM] Erg0sphere#0000
I have a ergo/sigusd swap showing up on the explorer then vanishing on off on off


[10/02/2022 9:50 PM] Erg0sphere#0000
1 minute its there, next it disappears


[10/02/2022 9:55 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
A bot tried to outbid your transaction. Some nodes on the network preferred it, others did not. Explorer uses three nodes, apparently even these three were not of the same opinion who should win.
Looks like you were the lucky one. üòâ


[10/02/2022 9:57 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
That's one of the reasons why a tx not in mempool is not immediately set to cancelled by the app. It still can get executed

Can't say for sure. The first one says that a box that was used in the transaction was spent in the meantime.

 That makes sense. Probably cos i was attempting without the prior tx having clear


[10/02/2022 11:14 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
If that was the case, the last one saying you don't have the SigUSD could be caused by that too. Because the sigusd were blocked by the waiting tx


[10/02/2022 11:15 PM] Erg0sphere#0000
That no cos there was enough Sigusd for both txs

The mobile UI was already on our DEX but there were no mobile wallets available. ErgoPay integration will fix this!

Try Spectrum on mobile using Ergopay! Any feedback is appreciated!

[10/09/2022 2:12 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Curious. I like Spectrum's mobile implementation. However, can it also be integrated into the wallet using Mosaik?


[10/09/2022 2:15 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
sure. if they will ever do it?
my bet is not before mosaik is released on ios, since they waited with ergopay all the time until the terminus release. and it looks like apple will not allow mosaik


[10/09/2022 2:16 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
but a swap screen is not so much difference from the swap screen for ageusd.

(re @Dudebythepoool : *Restored fingerprint and pattern don't work*) 
 
 Did you delete this wallet and restore it with your seed phrase?


[10/12/2022 4:03 PM] Dudebythepoool#0000
No just tried to add with seed phrase let me delete and retry


[10/12/2022 4:05 PM] Dudebythepoool#0000

[10/12/2022 4:08 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @Dudebythepoool : *Now have no ergo in it and wallet address is different ?*) 
 
 It means you put in the seed phrase incorrectly, wrote it down originally incorrectly, or are using a seed from a different wallet.


[10/12/2022 4:12 PM] Dudebythepoool#0000
Tried again same thing üò≠


[10/12/2022 4:16 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Not sure what to tell you. Without the correct seed phrase, you don't have the keys to the wallet.


[10/12/2022 4:26 PM] theta_decay#0000
(re @Dudebythepoool : *Tried again same thing üò≠*) 
 
 Possible the seed phrase is correct and you have no erg in this first address. Try adding 10 addresses and see if you recognize any of the added addresses.


[10/12/2022 4:32 PM] Dudebythepoool#0000
Got it to work copy pasting address space at top was messing it up for some reason typing it in worked and fingerprint works now thank you for all your help I appreciate it

Done any upgrade on the wallet recently? SigUSD-ERG swap Tx went through immediately


[10/13/2022 6:30 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
No, that was just some luck


[10/14/2022 3:46 AM] cafebedouin#0000
Strange behavior that I notice, and I think it's exclusive to using Ergo Mobile Wallet and ErgoPay. I'll have one transaction. It will get into the memepool, confirmed, and then a duplicate gets puts in the mempool. Same tx id and everything. The chain eventually clears it out, but it can be a little annoying when using something like Spectrum because it keeps resetting the interface as pending, for as long as the dupe is in the meme pool.


[10/14/2022 7:58 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
ergopay does not do something different when submitting a tx, the difference to nautilus is to where it is submitted an the difference to a normal send is that the transactions tend to be more complex.
both could be something to do with the issue, it looks like the mempool propagation and cleanup does not work correct

 yes always a bit hard to get "good" error messages, will take a look at it. at the moment it is a generic message that can also come up when the app itself has an error.

so i have the mobile wallet and nautilus, both with the same seed phrase. i generated an extra address in nautilus and received coin with it. however its not showing the new address or balance in the mobile wallet. Is there a way to add it manually?


[10/19/2022 11:39 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Wallet config -> addresses


[10/19/2022 11:41 AM] HippiePyro#9777
yeah i tried that any it just generates new addresses


[10/19/2022 11:43 AM] HippiePyro#9777
I imagine I need to specify the derivate path for the address I want to add, but I don't see an option to do that in the mobile wallet


[10/19/2022 12:22 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
It just adds the indices that are not present. Do you know the path for the address you are missing?


[10/19/2022 5:29 PM] HippiePyro#9777
yeah its 0'/0/4. which got me thinking, there was a few addresses not showing. So I generated a few addresses until I got far enough down to the one I was looking for. Thanks for your help

The user has to manually confirm with a check box that they stored the mnemonic in a safe place and know that loosing it means loosing access to the wallet.

 Did it have anything to do with averting bot frontrunning? Last AgeUSD tx went through immediately


[11/04/2022 11:25 AM] Erg0sphere#0000
Anyone experienced easier camera scanning during a tx with an iOS device as the offline signing device (vs an Android)? As an example, no need to blow up the qr image, therefore much faster scanning?


[11/04/2022 11:43 AM] Erg0sphere#0000
I would appreciate feedback as im preparing to buy a iOS device. AgeUSD txs take too long when u have to scan 10-11 images instead of a couple and i usually get frontrun by bots which drops the request


[11/04/2022 12:01 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
the ios devices scan better, yes


[11/04/2022 12:02 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
it is built in the hardware while on android it is a software analyzer

(re @Erg0sphere : *Did it have anything to do with averting bot frontrunning? Last AgeUSD tx went through immediately*) 
 
 no that was just coincidence. usually it should go through immediately :D


[11/04/2022 12:14 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Btw, of you consolidate your boxes you'll probably end up with less qr codes when you actually do the swap


[11/04/2022 3:17 PM] Erg0sphere#0000
Consolidate, as in send entire amount to another wallet and then back?


[11/04/2022 3:18 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
simply send entire amount to same wallet. check with the consolidate boxes mosaik app if you have many boxes. the app will say you everything alright, but having 5 boxes involved for a swap means already a lot of data for the qr codes


[11/04/2022 3:38 PM] Erg0sphere#0000
I didnt know u could do that, send to the same wallet


[11/04/2022 3:50 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
it is basically what the consolidate boxes app does, nothing else :)

[11/10/2022 2:25 AM] bennyk2#0000
@MrStahlfelge just looking over the p2p escrow service on tokenjay. Have you thought about expanding this to create a p2p on/offramp like binance p2p?


[11/10/2022 8:04 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
fiat on/offramp is not only a technical obstacle, but mainly a legal and organizational one


[11/10/2022 8:13 AM] bennyk2#0000
(re @MrStahlfelge : *fiat on/offramp is not only a technical obstacle, but mainly a legal and organizational one*) 
 
 What are the main obstacles as you see them?


[11/10/2022 8:19 AM] bennyk2#0000
From my brief study of binance p2p, the on chain side is relatively simple. The challenge is creating a system that generates enough trust between users for the fiat transaction to take place.

From a custodial perspective, no fiat ever needs to come under the management or ownership of the protocol owner / dao / contract. Perhaps some liquidity requirement could be used on the crypto side to incentivise users to good behaviour. This would obviously exclude users who are brand new to crypto and don‚Äôt have any to stake‚Ä¶ but maybe that‚Äôs a protocol refinement to make later


[11/10/2022 8:21 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
no matter if it is escrow or not, you are selling crypto currency or buying it. offramp seems to be even more complicated because of regulations regarding money laundry. in many countries you would need a bank license for these services (even ebay needs it in many countries since they are acting like an escrow provider). so the obstacle is to find a region where it is easy to set up a company for this and do it. it is more or less a crypto exchange anyway.
next is how to accept payments and do payments. not sure if paypal is working with crypto exchanges, but it does not seem so. so you have to establish partnerships with banks, like kraken partners with fidor bank in europe for using sepa payments.


[11/10/2022 8:22 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000

 no the technical obstacle is not high as this is a cex servie anyway. centralized services are more or less "easy", the hardest is to make a cex safe against hacks of any kind.


[11/10/2022 8:23 AM] bennyk2#0000
No but to my point - you don‚Äôt need a company/trust/partnership with banks. You don‚Äôt ever need to take or hold cash.

The users transact the fiat directly between themselves. This could be wire transfer, paypal, cash in person‚Ä¶ anything!


[11/10/2022 8:24 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
then it is not escrow


[11/10/2022 8:26 AM] bennyk2#0000
And that‚Äôs better right? No escrow, no central service to be censored‚Ä¶ it can exist on chain / hosted on a decentralised network, be owned by a dao etc


[11/10/2022 8:27 AM] bennyk2#0000
The ‚Äúpseudo-escrow‚Äù  is just a contract on chain that holds coins until users agree the fiat transaction has been completed


[11/10/2022 8:28 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
and when the crypto seller takes the payment, says buyer never paid and keeps the crypto coins?


[11/10/2022 8:28 AM] bennyk2#0000
Yep - that‚Äôs the sticky part.


[11/10/2022 8:30 AM] bennyk2#0000
There‚Äôs got to be a way to solve it ‚Ä¶ maybe cryptographically? Or incentivising a third party user?


[11/10/2022 8:32 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
that third party would act like an attesting notary. but again, not a technical obstacle - an organisational one


[11/10/2022 8:33 AM] bennyk2#0000
Many transactions use an element of trust - in this case, the main risk falls on the fiat seller.

But Who are likely to be the primary crypto sellers? Miners!

And of course it would be in miners best interests to be able to continue liqudating their coins‚Ä¶


[11/10/2022 8:34 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
what you are intending is a system of seller reviews like ebay had. before ebay did escrow, the base of trust was mainly the review system.


[11/10/2022 8:35 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
beginners not having any reviews usually got less bids but had to accept that to earn their trust.


[11/10/2022 8:35 AM] bennyk2#0000
Which they would do on a regular basis.

So if you can somehow kick-start it with  number of trusted parties‚Ä¶ eventually you would have an array of miners with strong good reputation (think ebay style feedback)


[11/10/2022 8:36 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I think it is an interesting suggestion, something worth to do for an ergohack


[11/10/2022 8:37 AM] bennyk2#0000
Anyway, it‚Äôs been kicking around in the back of my head for a while and I wanted to at least get it out there. It might have legs, it might not, but hey better than these ideas make it to the community than not

*bette thaT


[11/10/2022 8:42 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I like it, but it is a risk to buy for sure.


[11/10/2022 8:43 AM] bennyk2#0000
I feel like it‚Äôs a risk people will take - for small amounts.

It would be useful to get some hands on experience with binance p2p and see how that is working.
I know people locally who use it as they get a better rate and lower fee than other onramps


[11/10/2022 8:44 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
small amounts are interesting anyway when we want mass adoption. it is a problem that many fiat on ramps have a min amount to pay


[11/10/2022 8:46 AM] bennyk2#0000
I guess you could always lower the risk for users by using tranches‚Ä¶ ie i want to buy $1k so it goes through in 10x $100 lots. Each lot is verified individually.

Scammers might be happy to take $100 at a time, but they would lose their reputation very fast. You could implement a ‚Äúcool down‚Äù mechanism to prevent simultaneous transactions


[11/10/2022 8:59 AM] bennyk2#0000
To the motivation, there are three main aspects-

1) short term: give users access to erg in areas without current CEX option

2) long term: create censorship resistant / kyc-less method 

3) puts erg in the centre as the key infrastructure of an onramp option - pair this with rosen bridge / spectrum and it becomes a permissionless onramp into to any crypto asset!


[11/10/2022 12:43 PM] cafebedouin#0000
With Rosen Bridge, don't you already have an on ramp with BTC ATM machines? All of them require a phone number and in larger amounts, driver's license in my country. But, you put your money into the machine, get BTC. BTC to wBTC via Rosen Bridge, wBTC to Erg. The current escrow contract does P2P that allows tokens to Erg.

One feature that could be useful is tokens to tokens, say wBTC for SigUSD, since we are throwing out ideas here.


[11/10/2022 12:45 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Be interesting to see how the escrow contract gets used once we are out of a bear.


[11/10/2022 12:46 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Also, I think Glasgow mentioned bisq. That's another model that can be looked at if you want to do fiat p2p.


[11/10/2022 12:48 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
it would be great to have it on erg, it is a good use case for ergo's smart contracts. we would not need another layer like bisq needs.


[11/10/2022 12:48 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
it is really a good project for an ergohack


[11/10/2022 3:25 PM] cafebedouin#0000
New behavior for the wallet. Using tokenjay for SigmaUSD contract. I sign the transaction. It lists as pending in wallet. Goes on for 10 minutes or so. Check explorer, and it doesn't show unconfirmed at that address. I'd guess it has something to do with chained transactions?


[11/10/2022 3:27 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Eventually just lists as cancelled, which I assume means the contract rejected. Used to know that when block was done, but now there is a delay when the wallet reports it.


[11/10/2022 3:30 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
That delay was always there, it is 10 minutes before wallet shows as cancelled. I made it that way because both explorer and node unconfirmed transactions sometimes "flicker", unconfirmed transactions vanishing and coming back later.


[11/10/2022 3:31 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
You are right that sometimes you can notice better with your background knowledge, but there was a decision to make and showing as cancelled too early could lead to newbies accidentally sending out funds twice


[11/10/2022 3:31 PM] cafebedouin#0000

[11/10/2022 4:22 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Thanks, might need to lower the high res resolution as well


[11/10/2022 4:25 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Also, I think I had a delay due to messing with settings. At 30 minutes, reset to default and it immediately cleared.


[11/10/2022 4:35 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Pardon, don't understand?


[11/10/2022 5:23 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @MrStahlfelge : *Pardon, don't understand?*) 
 
 The delay was longer than 10 minutes. At 30 minutes, I reset explorer, node, etc to default and it cleared. I might had have a node, explorer or something that was down, slowing the update.


[11/10/2022 5:23 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Maybe getblok.


[11/10/2022 5:55 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Hm, could be


[11/11/2022 4:52 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Perhaps a dumb request. Would it be possible to create a low fee, medium fee, high fee option for babelfees that factors in cost of transaction, ui fee, and some minimal level of profit? 

Right now, let's say I have 10 Flux I'd like to make into a Babelbox. Trying to figure out the appropriate pricing, what should I price it at to make it worthwhile? That's significant cognitive load to figure it out.


[11/11/2022 4:53 PM] cafebedouin#0000
In fact, looking at these inputs, I have no idea what I should be doing here...


[11/11/2022 5:13 PM] cafebedouin#0000
So, let's say Erg to Flux ratio is 1 = 3.59300440


[11/11/2022 5:14 PM] cafebedouin#0000
From spectrum.


[11/11/2022 5:18 PM] cafebedouin#0000
So, am I putting in 0.0000000025 Erg per 0.00000001 Flux?


[11/11/2022 5:20 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Maybe it would be helpful to have it auto populate from Spectrum with then low, medium, high could be some premium for Erg, like 5%, 10% and 15% or more?


[11/11/2022 5:21 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Ok, realizing my first comment was dumb. This is for selling Erg for Flux.


[11/11/2022 5:22 PM] cafebedouin#0000
But, still same problem of figuring out the rate, and doing it in nanoergs is making the calculation harder to understand.


[11/11/2022 5:22 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Be better to have a straight Erg to Flux rate with Spectrum as a Benchmark.


[11/11/2022 5:23 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Then, you figure out how much profit should be added, which means you might need a sense of what other Babelboxes for this token there are.


[11/11/2022 5:24 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Also, I'd like it to be how much Erg I'm willing to sell at that rate.


[11/11/2022 5:24 PM] cafebedouin#0000
So, set the rate 1 Erg for 4 Flux. I'm willing to drop 3 Ergs in that box, and then that's it.


[11/11/2022 5:25 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Sorry, just working through this here, I'm dumber on maths than most programmers.


[11/11/2022 5:30 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Also, I think Erg has only 6 decimals, so can I even offer this level of fractionation?


[11/11/2022 5:31 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Ok, changing to SigRSV, which has no decimals.


[11/11/2022 5:35 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Spectrum has 1779.2. So, ERG per 1 SigRSV is 0.0005 is the rate and 2,000 tokens would be 1 Erg?


[11/11/2022 5:37 PM] cafebedouin#0000
In any event, it's complicated. Also, can someone just poach these boxes? SigRSV is going to have large swings, any reason someone can't write a bot to get the babelfees when it hits some economical threshold?


[11/11/2022 6:44 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Yeah you could write a box.
The UI to get a good rate is a big tricky. The one at the moment is "technical view".
To determine a price, I went the following route. SigUSD is at the moment at 0.55 ERG. So buying it for 0.4 ERG is indeed a good rate. I've entered 0.004 for 0.01 SigUSD.
Because the amounts are very small, Babel fee users will accept bad exchange rates. It does not really make any difference overall for them.


[11/11/2022 6:48 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Maybe people will come up with bots or great suggestions. I aimed to give layman's a way to provide Babel liquidity right from the beginning. And it is also a token buy order with a limit.


[11/11/2022 6:49 PM] cafebedouin#0000
I appreciate it. I'll probably cash out some SigUSD and add boxes for every non-meme coin. I just don't understand it well enough to do that yet.


[11/11/2022 7:11 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Also, wanted to say a quick word of thanks about Ergopay. Now that Spectrum is using it, prefer to use mobile because it's a much better experience.


[11/11/2022 7:59 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Ok, did boxes for SigUSD, SigRSV, and Ergopad.  I don't think it is possible to do Flux in a way that makes sense price wise since it has 8 decimals and Ergo has only 6. If you can figure it out, please let me know. Happy to add babel fees there. Now, going to try Neta.


[11/11/2022 7:59 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Ergo has 9 decimals


[11/11/2022 7:59 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Yeah, same problem with Neta, it's a fraction of the worth of Erg so no way to add babelfees there without it being a loss.


[11/11/2022 8:00 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Hmm. ok, I'll try again.


[11/11/2022 8:00 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
It should accept 9 decimals and with the 10th fraction get red


[11/11/2022 8:00 PM] cafebedouin#0000

I figure 10 to one since we are just dealing with small amounts is alright and I don't want to have to think too hard about the math.


[11/11/2022 8:03 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Ah I see! My bad it accepts 9 decimals but need a min value of 0.000001. need to change that.


[11/11/2022 8:03 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Red turns off when I take away two zeros.


[11/11/2022 8:04 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
But interesting thought is that Babel fee contract might not be suitable for tokens with too many decimal places


[11/11/2022 8:04 PM] cafebedouin#0000

Also, like the change to display box ratios for bablefees, this will help to know when to withdraw if the prices change a lot.


[11/12/2022 7:17 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Added it to the new box confirmation screen as well to better spot mistakes

(re @MrStahlfelge : *Added it to the new box confirmation screen as well to better spot mistakes*) 
 
 I had to go through a trial and error process for each box to get it right, scanning the QR before I could see the proposed tx. Being able to see everything befire hand like you do with the SigmaUSD would be good.

 I think you can use it, if you'd like. It'll need updating both as more wallets support Babel Fees, make the prices relevant when those change. But, perfectly usable as is.

(re @MrStahlfelge : *thanks, made two remarks which you can or cannot compile into the text. let me know when you think it is good to add to tj help pages. thanks in advance!*) 
 
 Curiosity question. Instead of Google Docs, would it be easier for you if this was worked on directly in the repo? Say, you create a stub with the name and in the directory you want, you point me to it here. I clone or fetch/pull, do a draft and submit a PR. You make comments. I change it. Then, you can merge? It seems that process would be easier and integrate with your workflow. But maybe not. Thought I'd ask.

 So, I've been having a problem where I do a transaction, it'll execute. Then, the exact same transaction will appear with a different time stamp in the wallet. I thought it was a Spectrum problem. But, I just did a transfer between two wallets and saw it happen there. Not sure it is a problem, per se, it eventually gets cancelled. But, counting back the last 60 transactions, it happens about 10% of the time.

Check the word list to find out which of your words is wrong.
I will probably add a last update the next days since a lot of users didn't store their mnemonic as it seems. So don't uninstall the non working app.

It is 15 words. And i had to check the 2048 list of words again. Just to make sure i did not put in wrong letters. Your 1st or 16th word could be your signing password to do transaction


[11/28/2022 2:03 PM] MaesterPoohBear#7443
Start from a to z. Making sure that your words are correct letter by letter. For an example.. you might hv noted in ‚Äúdive‚Äù instead of ‚Äúdove‚Äù

 Thanks! Yes, it is easy :-)

(re @cafebedouin : *@MrStahlfelge: Another new thing that is happening, trying to use Ergopay, I get the following error message: An error occurred: Not a JSON Object: null with a Retry button. 

Weird part is that it happens when trying to scan a QR code from a monitor. But, when I switch to the Ergopad.io site, works without any problems. I probably should mention to @Luivatra.*) 
 
 Yep that looks like a problem on ergopad's side. I could give you some more information to check yourself if interested, but that's more for developers

Hi! What if ergo wallet Beta ended and i dont have private key to my wallet because it was saved on ergo wallet. Now I don‚Äôt have access to my found.


[11/29/2022 10:58 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
when you created your wallet, you confirmed that you stored your mnemonic phrase in a safe place. what would you have done when you lost your device?


[11/29/2022 10:59 AM] Michal#0000
So there is No option to renew the Beta version?


[11/29/2022 11:01 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I already did it because you are not the only one. which surprised me to be honest. storing your funds in a single place is dangerous.


[11/29/2022 11:02 AM] Michal#0000
How can I renew beta?

 When u closed the beta, that‚Äôs when I learned the hard way that these words MUST be written down on actual paper and put them in an actual safe. üò¢


[11/29/2022 11:19 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I did not close it! It was stated that it is time-limited all along.
Please, take everything serious that you confirm. we all know that saving a mnemonic is inconvenient and creating a wallet without that would be easier without the extra confirmation screen. but it is there for an important reason.


[11/29/2022 11:21 AM] Gazza_SP#0000
(re @Mr. Nu : *When u closed the beta, that‚Äôs when I learned the hard way that these words MUST be written down on actual paper and put them in an actual safe. üò¢*) 
 
 But it says you must save the words when originally creating the wallet? Why did you not take this seriously with real money


[11/29/2022 11:24 AM] Mr. Nu#0000
(re @Gazza_SP : *But it says you must save the words when originally creating the wallet? Why did you not take this seriously with real money*) 
 
 I did save it (digitally) various places. But, it turned out I got extra words (16 instead of 15). Now, I wrote down all those correct 15 words and put them in a safe. No more digital saving. Lesson learned.


[11/29/2022 11:25 AM] Gazza_SP#0000
Oh man never save a seed phrase digitally üòÖ


[11/29/2022 11:25 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Now that you could compare, do you know where the extra word came from?


[11/29/2022 11:26 AM] Mr. Nu#0000
(re @Gazza_SP : *Oh man never save a seed phrase digitally üòÖ*) 
 
 Well, it‚Äôs easier for searching.

Yeah very risky though


[11/29/2022 11:26 AM] Mr. Nu#0000
(re @MrStahlfelge : *Now that you could compare, do you know where the extra word came from?*) 
 
 Not the first or last word. I haven‚Äôt check which one is the extra one yet. Somewhere in the middle.


[11/29/2022 11:27 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
how could that happen lol


[11/29/2022 11:28 AM] Mr. Nu#0000
I did ask the same question. All other 15 words are correct.


[11/29/2022 11:28 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
hm, so at least you would have found out with only 15 tries ;)


[11/29/2022 11:29 AM] Mr. Nu#0000
Exactly but it was still scary when I found out that I got 16 instead of 15 üò™

(re @MrStahlfelge : *I already did it because you are not the only one. which surprised me to be honest. storing your funds in a single place is dangerous.*) 
 
 Do u think storing all funds in a single wallet even if the seed phrase is safe, is still dangerous?


[11/29/2022 6:11 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
(re @Erg0sphere : *Do u think storing all funds in a single wallet even if the seed phrase is safe, is still dangerous?*) 
 
 No. With single place I was referring to storing the seed phrase only in a single place (the phone). You should have it on two places. Highly unlikely that both are destroyed at the same time.

 Yes

 I use pin for locking the screen

When enter the pin after ergo wallet request this error appears


[12/01/2022 11:23 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I will check with pin, only used with biometrics so far


[12/02/2022 9:10 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
checked. it does not work when no biometrics are set up, seems to be needed for the system to use the hardware secret storage


[12/02/2022 9:10 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I will improve the error message

(re @MrStahlfelge : *checked. it does not work when no biometrics are set up, seems to be needed for the system to use the hardware secret storage*) 
 
 Can't the wallet have its own password and not the device password? like trustwallet app


[12/02/2022 10:58 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
sure, simply use the option to protect by password, not by device encryption


[12/02/2022 10:59 AM] Cryptography313#0000
(re @MrStahlfelge : *sure, simply use the option to protect by password, not by device encryption*) 
 
 It is spending password, i mean password to enter the app


[12/02/2022 11:02 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
next version will get an optional app lock screen with biometrics. usually you only need to set it up if you share your device with your next ones, give it to children. but in that case a password does not help because anyone can see you enter it.


[12/02/2022 11:15 AM] Cryptography313#0000
(re @MrStahlfelge : *next version will get an optional app lock screen with biometrics. usually you only need to set it up if you share your device with your next ones, give it to children. but in that case a password does not help because anyone can see you enter it.*) 
 
 If i share my device with other one he can enter the app and see wallet balance and address That's why spending password does not have complete privacy


[12/02/2022 11:16 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
that's why next version will get an optional app lock screen with biometrics.
but not recommended to use it, instead do not share your device with others


[12/02/2022 11:16 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
or use different users on your device for different people, that is also safe

they don't provide an app plugin, you have to use their website


[12/02/2022 11:33 AM] Cryptography313#0000
(re @MrStahlfelge : *they don't provide an app plugin, you have to use their website*) 
 
 Ergo wallet browser works differently from metamask and trustwallet? Because they open any site apart from the connection


[12/02/2022 11:34 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
yes, works different. you can use wallet app plugins on that site. the connection to websites work from any other web browser, you don't need to open dapps on websites from within the wallet


[12/02/2022 11:45 AM] Cryptography313#0000
(re @MrStahlfelge : *yes, works different. you can use wallet app plugins on that site. the connection to websites work from any other web browser, you don't need to open dapps on websites from within the wallet*) 
 
 Anyway I think this feature is not user friendly


[12/02/2022 11:48 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
It is very user friendly if dapps support is. Then it is a native and adapted UI.
But I guess it comes down to taste what's better

 How do I check index?


[12/02/2022 2:42 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
depends of the software used showing the address. it is not wallet app as you've said, so what did you use for generating the address?

Forwarded from cafebedouin: Not sure if it is a Spectrum problem or Ergo Wallet problem, but when providing LP on Spectrum using the Ergo Wallet on mobile, clicking 100%, after transaction leaves 0.0001 of the token in your wallet. Happened with two different pools.


[12/03/2022 3:09 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Spectrum builds the transaction


[12/03/2022 3:40 PM] cafebedouin#0000

Wallet App 2.3.2223 is now available on Google Play Beta and GitHub https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-wallet-app/releases/tag/v2.3.2223

* Added biometric app lock on iOS and Android
* Can show detailed boxes information on transaction confirmation screens
* Targets Android 13
* Choose app language on desktop and Android 13
* Cold wallet data can be interchanged via clip board, not only QR codes

Would be great when everyone using Android 13 or having requested one of the features could test

Works on Android 13 here (Samsung XCover 6 Pro).

**About biometric login:**
In general works well. 

- I dislike that I have to press that "Unlock" button b4 it asks for the finger print upon launch. Other wallets just start the ID when opened.
- If you do not force close the app, will it auto lock after some time?
- What happens if the finger print sensor stops working or my finger is not recognized for some other reason? I wont be able to unlock my wallet, right?
- - I think you may need to add another auth type like a PIN or something to enable emergency unlock üòâ
- Deactivating finger print ID  should require the finger print or a PIN once more to approve. (Eg anyone can disable it atm if I leave it unlocked but open)


[12/06/2022 4:24 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Works fine on Android 13, Pixel 6, GrapheneOS. The only comment I'd make is you might want to compress the settings page and give the detailed description as part of a confirmation sub-screen. So, settings with Tokens and NFT settings with only the activate/deactivate button, click then display message with confirm at bottom.


[12/06/2022 4:25 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Given it's kind of set and forget, the one time for extra steps is probably not burdensome.

[12/06/2022 6:12 PM] MrStahlfelge#0042
to answer your questions:
- yes, will auto lock after 2 minutes
- you should already have a "use pin" button shown in the fingerprint screen which you can use. if you disable fingerprint auth system-wide the app lock will get disabled


[12/06/2022 6:15 PM] essaias#5787
aye, you are right. can use the other auth types I set up in android. never saw that button, till now üôÇ

so only the confirmation when disabling it would remain

There is no check for a rooting but of course you put your secrets at a risk by using a rooted phone


[12/14/2022 7:57 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
The biometrics use the hardware chip to store the secrets. Could be that your custom rom or rooting does not support that chip because, well, it is secured. Use password instead


[12/16/2022 4:07 PM] cafebedouin#9837
So, weird behavior I think may be wallet related. Lately, preferring your wallet and have been adding to Spectrum liquidity pool. It's been flawless.

Yesterday, tried adding, per usual, and tx gets locked. Switched to Nautilus, after three tries, which locks first time then goes through on second. The weird thing is that now the pool has different valueds depending if I look at it through Ergopad/mobile or browser and mobile. When I click on the pool info, the values are the same in both. However, in the Ergo Mobile Wallet I'm seeing an error of "Could not fetch requested information." when clicking on the pool.


[12/16/2022 4:40 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Where you can see pool information in wallet app?


[12/16/2022 6:52 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Wallet -> Details then touch any of the LP tokens to bring up balance, minting tx, etc. It's the last part that throws the error.


[12/16/2022 6:52 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Not on LP tokens, but most.


[12/16/2022 6:53 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Ah. When you got the error please go to settings and copy the debug information

 this indicates r6 for the token is not set which is a must for eip4

[12/18/2022 4:42 PM] Gazza_SP#0000

[12/18/2022 4:50 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Not a transaction. In wallet, going to details, click on token for more information. This is when the error occurs.


[12/18/2022 4:53 PM] cafebedouin#9837
This is assuming the error message is for last action in wallet.


[12/18/2022 5:26 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
That's my confusion the tx is built correctly?


[12/18/2022 5:30 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
(re  : *<cafebedouin> Not a transaction. In wallet, going to details, click on token for more information. This is when the error occurs.*) 
 
 When a token is minted, the minting transaction has to set registers 4 to 6 of the issuing box to hold the token metadata (name, description, decimal count). The stack trace indicates that R6 is not set but r4 and R5, which means this is not an eip-4 token but also not a non-eip-4 token. Hence showing information fails.
Whoever minted the token built the tx. The tx is correct but the eip-4 token information is not.


[12/18/2022 5:31 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Or this is not an eip-4 token so no information is present but r4 and R5 are set for other reasons, I can't know that without the token id


[12/18/2022 5:39 PM] cafebedouin#9837

[12/18/2022 5:41 PM] Gazza_SP#0000
I don't think there's anything that can be done at this point though unless they mint another token and fill R6 and airdrop to current token holders, not sure if it's worth it just to show correctly for LP tokens in wallet though


[12/18/2022 5:43 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Well, Nautilus shows the information for transaction, token ID and so forth - which is how I got them. So, it is possible to reconfigure, and show those details. But, it is currently not doing it in Ergo Mobile Wallet, and there's the question about, moving forward, whether Spectrum LP token minting needs to address this issue.


[12/18/2022 6:02 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
I will check the IDs tomorrow. In any case the error handling in wallet app needs to be improved as a failure on eip-4 metadata should not render the token data information useless as a whole


[12/18/2022 6:06 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Thanks for looking into it, MrStahlfelge and @Gazza_SP. Appreciate it!

It is minted with only R4 set which is not valid since R4-R6 are mandatory


[12/18/2022 8:49 PM] cafebedouin#9837
@Gazza_SP , above. Maybe something to look into on the minting and pool initialization contract.

 So just before I go back to Ilya, is this an issue with token generation first day or with our LP token generation on pool creation?

Smart Send Option
Hi.  First of all, I‚Äôm not a developer but I have an idea. An idea that might help in terms of speed in adoption. But please let me know if this idea is already existing in our blockchain.  Problem: it is always scary to send large amount of Erg to another wallet no matter how pro you are. Okay, test sending a small amount prior to full sending ...

Repeating here: It's utxo. So, you can check the address to see what happened. The most common problem is people put in the wrong seed phrase (such as by misspelling something) and get a different wallet

[01/10/2023 11:07 PM] gl#2103
It's strange it's two transactions. If I am an attacker and I get your seed why would I make two transactions, especially bigger amount for the first one (I might be making a small test transaction, but that would mean the first transaction is the smaller, not the second).


[01/10/2023 11:08 PM] Bib#0000

[01/10/2023 11:09 PM] gl#2103
I mean you had a bit over 300 ERG, if I am an attacker I take all 300 in one go, or I make a tiny first transaction just to see all is OK and then take the rest.


[01/10/2023 11:09 PM] gl#2103

[01/10/2023 11:13 PM] gl#2103
Yeah, not much to say here unfortunately. Unless someone found an iOS vulnerability to bypass the sandbox the only other option is that somehow someone found your paper seed and knew what to do with it. 

The iOS vulnerability is weird too because if someone can do that, there is very little chance they would go after Ergo wallets, let alone Ergo wallets with such a small amount. I mean if someone can do this they would go after large amount of BTC in other iOS wallets, etc.


[01/10/2023 11:13 PM] gl#2103
Remind me, is Terminus on iOS have a pin/password you set up?


[01/10/2023 11:14 PM] gl#2103
(if yes, then that is used to encrypt your locally stored seed, so even if the sandbox is bypassed somehow all the attacker would have is an encrypted seed)


[01/10/2023 11:15 PM] gl#2103
Let me say it this way: if I were a bad actor and I found a zero day vulnerability in iOS I wouldn't tip my hand off going after 300 Ergo.


[01/10/2023 11:15 PM] gl#2103
I would use my knowedge and opportunity to strike some big bucks before the attack is known and people take countermeasures.

There is a transaction data limit size. You have a lot of small boxes of Erg. So, you either need to send them in smaller increments or consolidate your Erg so it gets into a smaller number of utxo boxes and gets a smaller transaction.

In believe this is it


[01/25/2023 3:26 PM] Sonngrard#7422
The desktop wallet app doesnt show this transaction at all, just the mobile.


[01/25/2023 4:45 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Is it already shown as cancelled?


[01/25/2023 6:02 PM] Sonngrard#7422
In the desktop wallet, it doesnt even show up.


[01/25/2023 6:02 PM] Sonngrard#7422
Still shows as pending in the mobile wallet.


[01/25/2023 6:03 PM] Sonngrard#7422
And does reccur several times. But always the same with repeated -nft x y z.


[01/25/2023 6:43 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
you can delete and redownload the saved transactions on the transaction list screen if you scroll to the bottom. maybe that helps


[01/25/2023 8:03 PM] Sonngrard#7422

Is it an idea to move 'load the transactions' upwards? Or to settings?


[01/25/2023 8:41 PM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Normally there should be no such glitches as you experienced and it is only needed to load more into the past - that's why it is at the bottom

Could not prepare transaction

 I can't change the fee.


[02/01/2023 10:59 AM] MrStahlfelge#0000
Tap on fee amount, tap into the input field with the fee.
If you still have no execution, you can also try submitting to another node. Settings -> expert settings > wand button. 213 server seems to have problems at the moment

Try swiping from top of app down, this will have it sync.


[02/03/2023 11:16 PM] cafebedouin#9837
If it still doesn't match, check to see if the address matches.

 That‚Äôs not so bad. I‚Äôve been mining Ergo since ETH went bust in September and I would lose much more. Just don‚Äôt give access to your wallet to anyone.

 Hi, thank you. I did drag down and resync a number of times, still shows 0 balance. I did confirm public addresses match on yoroi wallet and ergo wallet


[02/04/2023 2:02 AM] cafebedouin#9837
If addresses match, then you have the correct seed. Does the address show coins in explorer, or some activity that the wallet has been drained?


[02/04/2023 2:07 AM] mdubsc#0000

[02/04/2023 3:56 AM] cafebedouin#9837
Check it in explorer:

 Ok, I'm sorry but I was wrong, the address isn't the same :(
I used my 15 word phrase with spaces in between each word and the wallet was created and the words match but it created a different address in the ergo wallet :/ I was able to scan the public key and I have access to the read only wallet but not a live wallet. Can u help?


[02/04/2023 6:12 AM] cafebedouin#9837
I'd recommend trying nautilus. When typing in seed phrases, nautilus will allow you to pick words from a drop down list. Do that, without adding spaces, and see if it connects you to the wallet that has your assets. If so, you can then create a new wsllet and transfer to it.

Your coins are gone, you will never see them again, ever. You fell for the most basic scam, never, ever give out your seed phrase. There is nothing anyone can do to get your coins back, at all, ever, Sorry but it sounds like you need to hear it.

Maybe I don't quite understand. There were no transactions, I just want to see that I'm mining than updating the browser a hundred times.


[02/19/2023 3:54 PM] biozon777#0000
Tatyana, where are you mining? What‚Äôs the mining payout threshold? What‚Äôs the maturity of ERGO at the pool you‚Äôre mining at? For example, Flypool matures ERGO before paying out. Check your pool settings and see your pool mining page for more info


[02/19/2023 4:04 PM] go_away69#0000
Cryptex pool, now 2miners. The payout is at least 1 ergo. I did everything according to the settings as specified in cryptex.


[02/19/2023 4:38 PM] biozon777#0000
So what does your pool say about immature balance?


[02/19/2023 4:38 PM] biozon777#0000
This is not like ETH used to be, Tatyana


[02/19/2023 4:52 PM] go_away69#0000
I just started doing this and I don't really understand, I did everything according to the instructions, so I'm writing here


[02/19/2023 5:04 PM] biozon777#0000
Ok. If you just started, wait a bit for a payout.


[02/19/2023 5:04 PM] biozon777#0000
What‚Äôs your public wallet address? Make sure you never tell anyone your pass phrase.


[02/19/2023 5:05 PM] go_away69#0000
I am interested in monitoring the coins in the wallet, where 0 is indicated, and 0.03 on the cryptex


[02/19/2023 5:11 PM] biozon777#0000
It really depends on what your hardware is


[02/19/2023 5:12 PM] biozon777#0000
There is a threshold that you set at your mining pool that pays out


[02/19/2023 5:12 PM] biozon777#0000
This means until that threshold is reached, there is no payout


[02/19/2023 5:16 PM] go_away69#0000
The threshold costs 1 unit. I just thought that what is being mined would automatically fall into the wallet


[02/19/2023 5:17 PM] biozon777#0000
Ok, I looked up your address from your screenshot


[02/19/2023 5:17 PM] biozon777#0000

[02/19/2023 6:16 PM] biozon777#0000
With 120 MH/s it‚Äôs going to take you a while to mine anything meaningful. I average 2 ERGO daily on a 2 GH/s farm. You should expect something like 0.12 ergo daily if you mine 24/7.  Not sure if it‚Äôs worth it for you with your electricity costs.


[02/19/2023 6:17 PM] go_away69#0000

Hello 
Who can answer to my following question?
Why ERG wallet will be deleted from yoroi extension?
Is ERG in cardano ecosystem?
With best regards


[02/23/2023 6:09 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Yoroi no longer supports Ergo. Ergo is its own block chain and has nothing to do with Cardano beyond it's creator worked with people at emurgo.io


[02/23/2023 6:10 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Nautilus is an Ergo wallet that is a web extension wallet like Yoroi and is better in every way.


[02/23/2023 6:10 PM] biozon777#0000
Or Terminus


[02/23/2023 6:12 PM] cafebedouin#9837
Terminus / Ergo Mobile Wallet if you want a mobile wallet, right.

So I finally downloaded Terminus today but for some reason my seed phrase didn‚Äôt match up with the correct address of my BETA wallet. Is there anyway to get a redeem code to go back in that data - I can view only the BETA wallet with the address


[03/10/2023 4:16 PM] Manny#0000
Data = BETA


[03/10/2023 4:19 PM] Manny#0000
Or is it possible I just put words down incorrectly in the seed phrase and it created a new wallet?


[03/10/2023 4:24 PM] Manny#0000
NVM figured it out it was above one of the words was wrong because I can‚Äôt read my own writing - corrected it and it brought in the correct wallet - the incorrect phrase appears to have created a new wallet with zero balance

Donc, je suppose que vous voulez dire que vous avez un portefeuille existant. Vous essayez de restaurer ce portefeuille √† l'aide de l'application Ergo Mobile ou Terminus (Apple). Et, vous n'obtenez pas le bon compte avec vos actifs. Si c'est vrai, la premi√®re question est de savoir si vous avez copi√© votre graine et l'avez saisie correctement.

Would it be possible and better if the app checks the node/api connections at start up and then sets the one to use for the app to which ever node comes back with the https connection, lowest latency and also the best block height?


[03/16/2023 8:17 AM] MrStahlfelge#0042
yes, but as long as we have no nipopows I am reluctant to set the api connections automatically as there is some level of trust to the servers involved

What does partner mean? Some cross-platform dapps like Spectrum. Some shared protocol implementations, like SigmaUSD and Djed. But, they are separate chains.
