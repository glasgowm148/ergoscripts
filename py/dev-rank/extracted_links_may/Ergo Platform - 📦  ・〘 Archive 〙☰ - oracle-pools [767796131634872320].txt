@Hedges Let's continue the conversation in here about oracle pools.


[10/19/2020 6:08 PM] Robert K#0722
So what it sounds like is that your `connector` is not able to find your `oracle-core`


[10/19/2020 6:09 PM] Robert K#0722
How are you starting your oracle?


[10/19/2020 6:19 PM] Hedges#0781
I'm running the sh run-oracle.sh command inside of the erg-usd-oracle-deployed sub directory


[10/19/2020 6:21 PM] Robert K#0722
Are you on linux?


[10/19/2020 6:21 PM] Robert K#0722
And do you have `screen` installed?


[10/19/2020 6:22 PM] Robert K#0722
The `run-oracle.sh` script effectively just opens screen and runs two commands:


[10/19/2020 6:23 PM] Robert K#0722
1. `./oracle-core`
2. `./erg-usd-connector`


[10/19/2020 6:23 PM] Robert K#0722
You can also just open two terminal windows in the folder and run each of those commands separately


[10/19/2020 6:40 PM] Hedges#0781
I'm running Windows subsystem for linux. I have screen installed and thought I was swapping between the two using the ctr + a - n command but I'll open up two to see more clearly


[10/20/2020 5:48 AM] scalahub#2618
Can you try what Robert suggested (run two commands in two different terminals without screen)?


[10/20/2020 5:48 AM] scalahub#2618
I had some issues and doing that sovled it for me


[10/20/2020 8:18 AM] Robert K#0722
@Hedges Do you have an ergo node running as well that is configured?


[10/20/2020 8:18 AM] Robert K#0722
I've never tried WSL for this kind of stuff, and I'm not sure how well the local networking works if there's any issues there.


[10/20/2020 8:19 AM] Robert K#0722
Effectively how it works is that the Connector talks to the Oracle Core which talks to the Ergo Node.


[10/20/2020 1:43 PM] Hedges#0781
yeah I ran the ./oracle-core separately and got the same thing. I have my node configured and it is synced. So is the oracle-config.yaml used between the oracle core and the ergo node? Which would mean that a configuration issue in that file wouldn't cause the issue that I am seeing?


[10/20/2020 1:59 PM] Hedges#0781
"ERROR  thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: The configured node is unreachable. Please ensure your config is correctly filled out and the node is running.': src/oracle_state.rs:122" this is the full log


[10/20/2020 3:27 PM] Robert K#0722
the config file is used by the `Connector` and the `oracle core`.


[10/20/2020 3:28 PM] Robert K#0722
So it sounds like your config file is not set up correctly


[10/20/2020 3:28 PM] Robert K#0722
Is the IP/port/api key correct in your `oracle-config.yaml`?


[10/20/2020 3:28 PM] Robert K#0722
Because it is either that those are incorrect, or WSL has some weird local networking problems most likely.


[10/20/2020 7:49 PM] Hedges#0781
yep you're right its definitely because I am running my node in windows and the oracle core in WSL. I'll look into a work around


[10/21/2020 8:40 AM] Robert K#0722
You should be able to run the node in wsl or the Oracle core + connector in windows.


[10/21/2020 8:40 AM] Robert K#0722
The code is in rust which should compile on windows, though it hasn't been tested.

@Robert K yes


[10/21/2020 11:15 AM] Robert K#0722
That test pool is currently in the Epoch Prep stage so maybe your node is not getting new blocks?


[10/21/2020 11:16 AM] Robert K#0722
You should be seeing something like

Seems to be working now. I wonder what could have caused node "disconnect".


[10/21/2020 11:24 AM] Robert K#0722
Indeed, good question. What version are you on?


[10/21/2020 4:03 PM] greenhat#6562
I built it from the develop branch last week. 🙂

Finally got back around to this. I'm on the bootstrapping step. I created the pool token and oracle token but where do I get there IDs?

{Reactions}
👋 (2) 

[11/13/2020 9:04 AM] Robert K#0722
How did you bootstrap Keith? Manually or using the cli


[11/13/2020 9:05 AM] Robert K#0722
Either way, you can check your address on the Ergo explorer and find the tokens inside of the outputs in each respective transaction.


[11/13/2020 2:02 PM] Hedges#0781
Okay I found the IDs.  I was going down the manual route but decided to restart using the cli but currently my requests are timing out when trying to hitting the endpoints in the cli though.


[11/13/2020 2:02 PM] Robert K#0722
Is your node accesible?


[11/13/2020 2:02 PM] Robert K#0722
@scalahub Any ideas?


[11/13/2020 2:03 PM] Hedges#0781
yes node is up and fully synced


[11/13/2020 2:06 PM] Hedges#0781
I was able to create my first oracle and pool tokens fine using swagger but step 3 of the manual process seemed a lot more intimidating than using the cli so I switched over. I can continue down the manual route and see how things go


[11/13/2020 2:10 PM] Robert K#0722
Did you configure your CLI to use your node ip/port & api key?


[11/13/2020 2:16 PM] Hedges#0781
oops good call I copy and pasted my node ip in my application.conf incorrectly let me fix that and try again


[11/13/2020 2:38 PM] Hedges#0781
alright now when I do the bootstrap pool command I get


[11/13/2020 2:38 PM] Hedges#0781
Error: Could not find or load main class bootstrapPool


[11/13/2020 3:40 PM] Robert K#0722
@scalahub , any ideas?


[11/13/2020 3:40 PM] Robert K#0722
@Hedges are you sure you typed in the command properly?


[11/13/2020 4:03 PM] Hedges#0781
I am noticing when I run the "java -jar oracle-pool-bootstrap.jar" command the output for that task is:


[11/13/2020 4:03 PM] Hedges#0781
java -cp <jarFile> boostrapPool <oracleTokenId> <poolTokenId> <initialDataPoint_serialized>


[11/13/2020 4:03 PM] Hedges#0781
its spelled "boostrapPool" but I tried that and am getting same result


[11/13/2020 4:05 PM] Robert K#0722
Ah, thanks a lot for testing this out @Hedges. We've used it a few times but haven't had many others give it a go yet.


[11/13/2020 4:05 PM] Robert K#0722
@scalahub Will jump in at some point when he's next on and help you out since he wrote the bootstrap CLI.


[11/13/2020 4:08 PM] Hedges#0781
yeah no problem! So are oracle pools in a testnet phase? and incentives and disincentives will be added on later?


[11/13/2020 4:10 PM] Robert K#0722
Incentives are currently in place already.


[11/13/2020 4:10 PM] Robert K#0722
The next release will implement deviation checking consensus.


[11/13/2020 4:11 PM] Robert K#0722
And in the future we will be looking into adding disincentives on top of that.


[11/13/2020 4:32 PM] Hedges#0781
sweet, and that Cardano interoperability development is exciting. A lot to learn!


[11/13/2020 6:57 PM] Hedges#0781
btw it was named wrong it needs to be "bootStrapPool"

@Hedges can you give the error details? is that the error in the image?

yeah that was the last line. here's the whole thing

[11/13/2020 7:17 PM] scalahub#2618
is the token tx confirmed?


[11/13/2020 7:17 PM] scalahub#2618
It should print a json. Did you try posting the json to swagger?


[11/13/2020 7:18 PM] scalahub#2618
to `wallet/transaction/send`


[11/13/2020 7:18 PM] scalahub#2618
Are you using the same node for oracle pool? (as an existing pool member)


[11/13/2020 7:19 PM] scalahub#2618
I have run into issue like this when the same node is used for oracle pool. it seems that the box with token may be currently use in one of the oracle transactions.. best to try on a different isolated node


[11/13/2020 7:21 PM] scalahub#2618
> its spelled "boostrapPool" but I tried that and am getting same result
@Hedges yes its a typo.. good catch.


[11/13/2020 7:24 PM] scalahub#2618
for now you can try again after sometime and if still getting error, shut down oracle core, wait for several minutes and try again


[11/13/2020 7:28 PM] Hedges#0781
yes tx is confirmed, I haven't tried swagger. The node I specified in the application.conf was my own. Is that what you are referring to?


[11/13/2020 7:37 PM] scalahub#2618
yes if that node is also participating in some dapp (like oracle pool) then the tokens will be locked up and you will get this error


[11/13/2020 7:37 PM] scalahub#2618
try now


[11/13/2020 7:38 PM] scalahub#2618
and if still getting error then shut down the oracle core for sometime before trying


[11/13/2020 7:47 PM] Hedges#0781
okay tried and got same error. To shut down the oracle core do I have to do something else besides kill the screens?


[11/13/2020 7:48 PM] Hedges#0781
nevermind


[11/13/2020 7:49 PM] Hedges#0781
so what is the most sustainable solution for this? Create another node and point my application.conf to that?


[11/13/2020 9:14 PM] Robert K#0722
Yeah, just kill the screens.


[11/13/2020 9:14 PM] Robert K#0722
Having 1 node (wallet) per oracle is the cleanest solution to not override each other in spending the same boxes


[11/13/2020 9:15 PM] Robert K#0722
And so yes, point your conf at the new node


[11/13/2020 10:12 PM] Hedges#0781
okay but can't I bootstrap into the erg-usd pool that is already out there rather than creating my own pool?


[11/14/2020 5:05 AM] scalahub#2618
> okay but can't I bootstrap into the erg-usd pool that is already out there rather than creating my own pool?
@Hedges The pool is already bootstrapped, so you cannot bootstrap it again. Now bootstrapOracle is possible but even for that you need the oracle tokens (which I guess you don't).. I can send some if you need. please paste wallet address 
`java -cp oracle-pool-bootstrap.jar bootStrapOracle`


[11/14/2020 5:07 AM] scalahub#2618
even for that, can you run a separate wallet indepent of current oracle pool? The issue is the node using the token box for oracle transactions and not letting the box be free for our use


[11/14/2020 8:07 AM] Robert K#0722
It's not that vital to have two node wallets to get it to work.


[11/14/2020 8:07 AM] Robert K#0722
It's helpful, but not vital.


[11/14/2020 1:13 PM] Hedges#0781
Is there a good spot to read more about the token box? Basically a node runs into issue if it's token box is being used for oracle transactions and for validating blocks, correct? Let me look into creating another node


[11/14/2020 1:41 PM] Hedges#0781
also what is specified in the --mainnet argument in the jar command? Trying to figure out how to run new node on new port


[11/15/2020 4:56 AM] scalahub#2618
The command is `java -jar ergo-x.y.z.jar -c <configfile> -mainnet`  (no argument for mainnet)


[11/16/2020 8:21 AM] Robert K#0722
What error are you getting specifically @Hedges ? It might be related to spending the same box, and it might be not, but need more info.


[11/16/2020 4:32 PM] Hedges#0781
This was the main error I was receiving. I haven't had a chance to create another node yet

[11/16/2020 4:42 PM] Robert K#0722
And this error came from the oracle-core?


[11/16/2020 4:42 PM] Robert K#0722
Or the CLI?


[11/16/2020 4:43 PM] Robert K#0722
(I imagine the oracle-core, and you didn't bootstrap your oracle properly)


[11/16/2020 4:43 PM] Robert K#0722
And using a second node wouldn't help in that case.


[11/16/2020 5:06 PM] Hedges#0781
java -cp oracle-pool-bootstrap.jar ergo.oraclepool.BootStrapOracle <oracleTokenId> <poolTokenId> <oracleAddress>
It came from this CLI command


[11/16/2020 5:55 PM] Robert K#0722
Did you already mint the Oracle participant tokens?


[11/16/2020 5:55 PM] Robert K#0722
The Oracle token you are using for Oracle token id


[11/16/2020 6:03 PM] Hedges#0781

[11/16/2020 8:58 PM] Hedges#0781
yep that was it. I am seeing the bootstrap pool and bootstrap oracle transactions now


[11/16/2020 9:06 PM] Hedges#0781
but still getting this error: The UTXO-Set scans have not found all of the oracle pool boxes yet.

Error: No Boxes Found For Local Oracle Datapoint Scan


[11/16/2020 10:13 PM] Robert K#0722
Ah, glad to hear that was it.


[11/16/2020 10:13 PM] Robert K#0722
So you will have to trigger a rescan via swagger for your node wallet


[11/16/2020 10:14 PM] Robert K#0722
Since you launched the Oracle core after you bootstrapped the pool, the scans weren't registered until after you created the boxes.


[11/16/2020 10:14 PM] Robert K#0722
So you have to rescan for your node to find the boxes so the Oracle core can act.


[11/17/2020 3:36 PM] Hedges#0781
okay so looking at swagger using the wallet/boxes/unspent get request I see one box with  "onchain": true, but the rest are false. To confirm, there is a box for each stage in the epoch but we are only bootstrapping the epoch preparation box and the oracle datapoint box? Is there a way for me to verify which of these boxes is on chain and which one is not?


[11/17/2020 3:46 PM] Robert K#0722
You have to use the /scan/ endpoints for checking scans


[11/17/2020 3:47 PM] Robert K#0722

[11/17/2020 3:47 PM] Robert K#0722
Check your scanIDs.json, and use the ids via that endpoint to see if your node found the boxes


[11/17/2020 3:48 PM] Robert K#0722
Otherwise use the rescan endpoint and wait for your node to rescan the whole history to find them

[11/17/2020 4:18 PM] Hedges#0781
good to know. Looks like it is the epoch preparation box. I'll rescan again to see if I get same result and then troubleshoot it later today when I get some more time


[11/17/2020 4:41 PM] Hedges#0781
okay cool looks like node is able to find epoch preparation and datapoint boxes. Do I now simply wait for the epoch to reach the live epoch scan stage?


[11/17/2020 6:41 PM] Robert K#0722
Indeed, the oracle core should move the oracle pool from epoch prep -> live epoch


[11/17/2020 6:41 PM] Robert K#0722
You need to keep the oracle core running


[11/17/2020 6:41 PM] Robert K#0722
And the connector as well, so that your oracle can post datapoints


[11/19/2020 10:28 PM] Hedges#0781
to confirm, the assets listed in our wallet are also used for the pool token id and oracle token id, correct?


[11/19/2020 10:30 PM] Robert K#0722
No, both of those tokens are held in P2S (smart contract) addresses and so they don't show up by default in the wallet


[11/19/2020 11:04 PM] Hedges#0781
okay so https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/8f3d4ed262702caad89f33309322997a006581ffc29bba62b2041911fe2a6062 in this transaction would "fa46f43fab1712d392997ca49bda9a2678a2e0671be3d2e1e8ad882c8c7112da" be considered the token id

@Robert K 
Hi

I have a problem for start orcle-core
after run `sh run-oracle.sh` i get:

```
UTXO-Set Scans Have Been Successfully Registered With The Ergo Node
```
so press enter for continue but in oracle-core i get this error:

```
The UTXO-Set scans have not found all of the oracle pool boxes yet.

Error: No Boxes Found For Local Oracle Datapoint Scan
```
And in connector:

```
Erg-USD Connector
===========================================
Current Blockheight: 430105
Current Oracle Pool Stage: Epoch Preparation
Submit Datapoint In Latest Epoch: true
Latest Datapoint: 0
===========================================
```
after that i called rescan endpoint in node(4.0.7) but the error did not change.

do you know what is the problem?
I think should send token oracle pool to my oracle address ?


[02/23/2021 10:54 AM] Robert K#0722
Have you bootstrapped your own oracle pool @zargarzadehmoein ?


[02/23/2021 10:55 AM] Robert K#0722
You need to create your own pool, then with the oracle participant tokens from that pool, you need to send 1 to the address of your ergo full node which you have configured in your oracle core config file


[02/27/2021 11:21 AM] JamesKelley#2466
Hello! I'd like to run the oracle pools. I'm a Cardano stake pool operator and know my way around Linux and servers but I'm new to these oracle pools. Do I start with installing the oracle-core? I wasn't real clear on how to bootstrap the ERG-USD and ERG-ADA oracles, any hints/tips?


[02/27/2021 11:23 AM] Robert K#0722
Hi there @JamesKelley You can start your own oracle pool by following the instructions in the oracle core repo.


[02/27/2021 11:24 AM] Robert K#0722
The current erg-usd and ada-usd oracle pools are not open for absolutely anyone to join, as that would be insecure (open to sybil attacks).


[02/27/2021 11:25 AM] JamesKelley#2466
I see. Would there be an advantage to my getting involved if I were able to convince you that I'm safe? I'm better known on the Cardano side of things.

I'd love to be pointed in the right direction so I can learn what would be best for the ecosystem regarding pools as well. Based on what you said I take it that I could start an ADA-BTC  pool, but I want to develop a deeper understanding of what would be useful before trying to jump into anything.

Actually, there were other build components missing as well. They all seem to have been resolved by running the following:

sudo apt install build-essential

After that, I was able to fully run the prepare script in Step 3 successfully.


[03/12/2021 10:26 PM] cymatic#8185
I have my new oracle fully configured except for editing the oracle-config.yaml file.

The instructions tell you to enter "your oracle address (address that was used for bootstrapping the pool & is inside of your Ergo Node wallet), and other relevant pool information".

I guess this is the point where you have to be invited to the pool as a trusted member...so someone can provide you with this info?

Cheers! I'd like to run an oracle for USDT and/or ADA using an existing pool.

I already have the software build and running, but I am unsure what to put into the config of the oracle...

I see all the fields on https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/oracle-pool-state/ergusd but am not sure if I just can copy them?

2nd question: Are ports to open in the firewall?

Thx in advance.

[04/19/2021 1:42 PM] essaias#5787
Alright @scalahub and @kushti ... 😉

I'd like to run an Oracle and when I understood right, I can just operate the oracle and use an already existing pool: https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/oracle-pool-state/ergusd

So  I followed this "guide" https://github.com/ergoplatform/oracle-core and have the oracle core and USDconnector build.

Both do run, but I only see this message in the connector:
```
The UTXO-Set scans have not found all of the oracle pool boxes yet.

Error: No Boxes Found For Local Oracle Datapoint Scan```

The connector output:
```Connector: Erg-USD Connector
===========================================
Current Blockheight: 470914
Current Oracle Pool Stage: Epoch Preparation
Submit Datapoint In Latest Epoch: true
Latest Datapoint: 0
===========================================```


[04/19/2021 1:44 PM] essaias#5787
(and yes I had the wallet do a rescan)

I think that my oracle-config.yml is wrong... But its hard to find any valid information on what values to get from where...

My oracle-config.yml:
```#### Local Oracle Parameters ####

I assume just copying the values from the pool is wrong. But how / where do I get the right credentials?


[04/19/2021 3:34 PM] scalahub#2618
You cannot run your own oracle and join an already existing pool. You can, however, run your own oracle pool.
You can use the existing pool only to read the data and not write data to it.. hope that helps


[04/19/2021 3:35 PM] essaias#5787
Ok, then the text "The majority of oracle operators will only need to focus on setting up their own oracle core to work with an already bootstrapped oracle pool." in the guide mislead me somewhat...


[04/19/2021 3:35 PM] essaias#5787
That means I'll set up a bootstrapped pool as well


[04/19/2021 3:36 PM] scalahub#2618
yes probably needs a bit of rewording. This is assuming that the operator is joining an already bootstrapped pool


[04/19/2021 3:37 PM] essaias#5787
ok, so does every oracle need its own pool? thought several could use one?


[04/19/2021 3:37 PM] scalahub#2618
so this guide will be for an operator who wants to join your bootstrapped pool 🙂


[04/19/2021 3:38 PM] essaias#5787
ok, then other way: are there existing pools to join, and if so: where / how? 🙂


[04/19/2021 3:39 PM] scalahub#2618
well there are two existing pools but they don't have free slots AFAIK .. but best to check with @kushti in this regard


[04/19/2021 3:40 PM] scalahub#2618
Since pool data has lot of external dependencies, its not possible for anyone to join the pool adhoc.. only selected few have the right to post rates 🙂

I have a question about Oracle pools. Want an Oracle that will give me temperature and rainfall details. I want to be able to guess if the ground is saturated based on how how much it has recently rained. I only need the data for some areas, not the entire globe, but I'd like the option of expanding the number of areas as needed.


[04/26/2021 9:51 AM] JamesKelley#2466
Let's say I start with five areas and I can pull the data from known weather sources. Will I be able to accomplish that with one Oracle pool or will I need many?


[04/26/2021 3:23 PM] amsk#6884
Hello... I'm doing some researches on oracle pools. I want to use this oracle pools's solution for some other issues than creating an stable coin etc. as @JamesKelley said. For example I want to provide some football matches odds or results using this protocol...I read oracle core and connectors (frontend and backend) rust codes and also oracle pool's smart contracts...For doing this I need to submit an string as datapoint in first place...So I think I should make changes in connectors libraries, oracle core source codes and also smart contracts...Generally I should rewrite many parts of the library to achieve this, but before start i want to ask if this issue is practical?...Can I use oracle pools to provide such data ever?...
@scalahub @kushti 
PS: I know oracle pools does not provide data on demand so I plan to provide some specific data like Premier League last week of matches results...(or simpler at the begging a specific team last match result)


[04/26/2021 8:34 PM] scalahub#2618
yes as far as I recall you just need to write a new connector for the data source


[04/26/2021 9:44 PM] amsk#6884
thank's....It seem's to be more places to change, cause all variables that hold datapoint are numeric type (Int > in smart contracts and u64, f64 in connector and oracle core source codes)...I want to implement an oracle pool to provide more flexible data, for example fixed length strings (Hash of raw data) and raw data store in some other place not in tx registers...I guess this way oracle pool can provide much more complex data (e.g. JSON string)...But then some concepts like deviation checking and datapoints average calculating makes no sense...


[04/27/2021 1:04 AM] JamesKelley#2466
Also, multiple data points, such as the temperature in London and Paris. A smart contract might only need one of those, so will it need to read both?


[04/27/2021 5:46 AM] scalahub#2618
oh sorry I assumed you will be posting Long..  the smart contracts are designed for Long data point. so as long as the data you want to submit ls long you will just have to write a connector.. otherwise need to change both smart contracts and the offchain code (both connectors and oracle-core)


[04/27/2021 8:14 AM] amsk#6884
To achieve this, I think you can concatenate these temperatures and submit all of them as a single data point (Stored in a single register of your oracle pool's live epoch box)...But to doing such things as Scalahub said, you will have to rewrite offchain code and smart contracts in order to support  your data type (e.g BigInt or Array of Bytes)...


[04/27/2021 8:22 AM] JamesKelley#2466
I'm guessing this doesn't scale well if we wanted temperature or rainfall data from every city. That's what I need for one project, the ability to calculate if the ground is saturated in about 5 to 10 different locations. I know Wolfram will be available on Cardano at some point but I'm looking for something I could implement now if possible.


[04/27/2021 9:27 AM] amsk#6884
In your case I think you can even run an oracle pool for each city you want to have it's humidity and temperature data and each smart contract or dApp need these data, can use relevant oracle pool...Generally I think the oracle pools can be more scalable and cover more dApp needs for data and provide more complex data later...


[04/27/2021 10:15 AM] nitram147#5106
@JamesKelley If it's not a secret what will be your project about? I can imagine only some type of insurance dApp against dry periods which would calculate  insurance fee based on the probability that there will be dry period. However it doesn't make a sense for me 🙂


[04/27/2021 10:22 AM] JamesKelley#2466
I am in discussions with a former International Insurance Commissioner to get him on board with designing insurance products that will pass as many regulatory regeimes as possible but in this case I'm wanting it for an unannounced project. The two different ideas are related, so you're on the right track.

Rainfall and saturation aren't always consistent.


[05/16/2021 12:47 AM] JamesKelley#2466
For sure, which is why I'm also asking about other data points being added. There are different directions I can take the rainfall data, from not enough to too much rain affecting different things differently, but then you also have to deal with the locations which means there will be many different sets of the same data.

Since the time I wrote the question I have started to realize a more sophisticated oracle system will need to be developed but I haven't settled on anything yet.

Where are you in your process?


[05/16/2021 3:31 AM] QU₳Z₳R#0436
It may also be necessary to consider the human element, water-main break, construction accident, runoff routing, downfield pollutants; it may not rain at all and the ground be saturated and flood. If you find the right insurance carrier, they'll provide reinsurance and fronting paper which is often already filed/approved on a multi-national, international level.


[05/16/2021 3:35 AM] QU₳Z₳R#0436
The oracle system may need to be more sophisticated or perhaps less, considering the potential power of pools of oracle pools of oracles.

The biggest edge we have over chainlink that I've seen so far, and I'm only really starting to get into the dev side so don't know much specifics is that we don't have to use a seperate token to pay to use the Oracle, every customer can just pay in erg. The link token is basically unnecessary and it's now been proven by the ergo Oracle and further by the Oracle pools.

[06/04/2021 12:18 AM] Kaven#6681
okay so do i understand correctly that the game theoretic lynchpin of oracles is collateral and slashing for deviation?


[06/04/2021 12:18 AM] Kaven#6681
like this is _the_ model for making oracles work right?


[06/04/2021 12:24 AM] arokace#8057
Can someone explain what these Oracle Pools are?  Are these some kind of pool someone can make ergo from or does it have a different meaning in this context.  I see they have something to do with dApps and the UTXO model.  Granted I don't understand the UTXO model very well either.  dApps is just the apps built on top of the Ergo network right?

dapp means one or more smart contracts and typically implies some kind of ui, like a web ui


[06/04/2021 5:06 AM] Kaven#6681
dapps consume oracle data if they need off chain data, which is most interesting/complex use cases


[06/04/2021 5:06 AM] Kaven#6681
so like exchange rates is the biggest use case for oracle data probably, but could be sports scores, weather data, court rulings, etc


[06/04/2021 5:23 AM] Kaven#6681
i'm trying to get my head around oracle frameworks and game theoretic security myself. its a tough subject for the layperson.


[06/04/2021 5:25 AM] Kaven#6681
my impression so far in my admittedly limited research is that chainlink has been pretty slow to implement collateral requirements, and for ergo's oracle framework, there are robust collateral requirements baked in. but this is precisely where i need to research more.


[06/04/2021 5:26 AM] Kaven#6681
i guess the idea is oracles must put up in-kind collateral that is more valuable than the rewards they're earning, so if they are sloppy or malicious, their collateral is lost, at least partially


[06/04/2021 5:27 AM] Kaven#6681
one of the main things i cant get my head around is the game theoretic or cryptoeconomic approach to collusion


[06/04/2021 5:29 AM] Kaven#6681
so its well and good that we have some algo that detects a certain deviation, or incentivizes reporting of deviations, from the norm, but then what prevents collusion where many oracles agree secretly, off-chain, to lie and game the contracts the supply data to.


[06/04/2021 7:33 PM] danandbeard#3509
what part are you struggling with?  to prevent malicious behavior you have to incentivize good behavior enough and/or penalize bad behavior enough to make it a losing proposition to be malicious


[06/04/2021 7:39 PM] danandbeard#3509
chainlink (according to the article you linked, I've only read a bit on it) appears to only give incentive to behave "implicitly" which is to say there's no immediate incentive, just that bad behavior would get them removed from the oracle pool and they'd lose future earnings

ERG appears to pay top down with multi-stage contracts which I don't understand but the penalties make total sense - to be an oracle in an oracle pool you have to stake something of value that can be taken from you if you misbehave...that was the penalty is immediate and direct and you don't rely on "implicit" loss of not getting future funds by being a good oracle


[06/04/2021 7:40 PM] danandbeard#3509
act bad in a chainlink pool?  you get kicked
act bad in an erg pool?  you lose your stake and get kicked


[06/04/2021 8:44 PM] Kaven#6681
i understand collateral and slashing, i'm just looking for cryptoeconomic guards against collusion

Does anyone have any pointers on how I would go about querying the erg-usd oracle historical values. I see https://github.com/bdkent/sigmausd-history/blob/main/src/process.ts (line 28) uses them, however it seems to be from a file produced by code not in the repo.
Can it be done through the api on https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/api ?
Do I need to run a full local node (ergo-bootstrap)?
Would I be able to use ergo-appkit?
Any pointers to tutorials or working code would be great.

[06/14/2021 12:09 PM] Snax#3268
Here is my understanding of how the oracle pool contracts included in Oracle Core (https://github.com/ergoplatform/oracle-core) work. Please correct me if I got anything wrong, I am trying to wrap my head around oracle pools.


Each oracle uses a "datapoint" contract to store what they think the datapoint should be, which basically just takes the last box protected by itself, and consumes it to create a new one with a new datapoint. 

The pool consists of:

- The contract used to protect deposits into the pool, which can only be spent to create a box protected by:
- The "epoch prep" contract, which collects the pool's funds and checks whether a new epoch can begin. It can be spent to create a new epoch box protected by:
- The "live epoch" one, which stores the latest pool datapoint, and the spending transaction of which must include the datapoints of the oracles in the pool as data inputs, and creates a new box protected by itself storing the next pool datapoint. A box protected by it always stores the latest pool datapoint.

[06/23/2021 4:28 AM] abchris#8522
@Snax, I think the individual data postings are collected at the epoch prep stage. So they're data-inputs for the tx producing he new epoch prep box, not the live one. The epoch prep box contains the new aggregated datapoint and is then spent to produce the new live epoch box. During the live epoch each oracle can post to his data box, etc...


[06/23/2021 4:30 AM] abchris#8522
Question:
If data boxes can only be spent by their respective oracle (whose address is encoded in R4), then what is this tx doing? Seems 9iDs7k is spending 9fzRcc's data box?

Did you ever figure this one out? Was hoping the Ergo Oracle pool solution was going to be something smaller-time IT or SMB folks could participate in. It reads like it publicly, but then still seems like you need to invest heavily in the coin and/or be your own customer.

Hi guys, hope you don't mind me asking a question. I've just recently found out about Ergo and Oracle Pools. My question is, for the Oracle Pool to Cardano. Will there be a new coin for it, or will the Oracle Pool run off the ERGO blockchain's PoW and use ERG? Or will there be a new coin to be mined/staked for Oracle Pools? I either can't seem to find the answer anywhere or I'm just bad at searching.

It practically means close to nothing. So it is very possible :)


[07/15/2021 9:16 PM] blale#5355
theoretically, wouldn't this still be possible? have some kind of JSON schema registry maintained by Ergo Governance process. People could submit new schemas for approval that support new complex datapoint response types...if schema is followed and validated at the node...and yeah, some kind of weighted deviation check per json property? (I'm spitballing here)..then store largish (>2kB ?) payloads to a separate "payload blockchain" whereas the primary ergo blockchain just stores references to this?


[07/23/2021 9:44 PM] danandbeard#2312
how does cardano utilize ergo oracle pools? presumably their smart contracts will have some way to reference on-chain data from ergo, right?


[07/24/2021 4:27 PM] glasgowm#9381
There's a first generation hosted here https://nut.link/ by @mmahut that uses metadata to get it on cardano. Article here https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-11-09-first-steps-towards-interoperability-with-cardano-oracles/

To work natively and utilise all the benefits of oracle pools ideally IOHK needs to add data-inputs to ADA as described here https://cardanoupdates.com/docs/255f71e1-458d-47e2-8504-3f25c729b44e by @Robert K which seems like it would make DeFi in general a lot more practical on Cardano. Lots of startups trying to solve this problem atm - not sure what the current most likely is - and cardano itself is probably just focusing on getting alonso out.

[07/24/2021 8:43 PM] abchris#8522
If Cardano ends up supporting data input boxes, they could just have their own oracle pools, right? No need to interact with Ergo.


[07/24/2021 8:58 PM] glasgowm#9381
Maybe? They'd need to port it all to Plutus, not sure if there's any other blockages. But the issue is you can't read data in cardano's eUTXO without spending a box. So you can't reference anything (ie, prices from an oracle) easily.


[07/25/2021 2:14 AM] abchris#8522
Hmm, I need to read up on it. I thought the reason Ergo was jumping in as oracle solution for Cardano was precisely because Cardano chose not to support read-only boxes.

[08/15/2021 8:05 PM] Microproofs#4407
Hi,
I was wondering if there is any need for running an oracle pool that adds random entropy into the system via RNG. I’d love to add more oracle data points to ergo. The only concern I’d have is how the oracle pool would consolidate multiple RNG providers.


[08/17/2021 9:07 PM] nitram147#5106
Why should anybody trust that the numbers were really generated randomly? It doesn't make sense.


[08/17/2021 9:08 PM] nitram147#5106
If somebody want to have access to random numbers there are many better ways to obtain them on ergo rather then to blindly believe to some pool.


[08/17/2021 9:09 PM] nitram147#5106
And even the pooling concept doesn't make sense - how do you want to aggregate random numbers into a one number? Even if you xor them, there will be still a  place for cheating by the last entry in specific round.


[08/17/2021 9:13 PM] Microproofs#4407
Right now Ergo does not have outside entropy to help with applications like lottery systems. As is a miner could take advantage of the pseudo randomness to win that lottery. There is more on this subject on the ergo forum under the lottery thread


[08/17/2021 9:16 PM] nitram147#5106
If you make a contract that way, that you will require specific hash of block in advance (before it's known), to be able to 100% cheating, every miner should cooperate and mine only block (with that specified height) which hash will result in winning of the cheaters party. However nobody knows who would be lucky to get to mine specific block. And miner isn't incentivized to help cheating someone for free. So there has to be an extremely large bet and every miner should cooperate with cheater party to be able to 100% succeed by cheating.

This was the topic btw


[08/17/2021 9:18 PM] Microproofs#4407
Merely curious about creating a new source of data. And a new piece of information might add the needed randomness anyway


[08/17/2021 9:19 PM] nitram147#5106
I know what do you want to achieve, however I'm almost sure that it cannot be easily achieved by ordinary oracle pool concept.


[08/17/2021 9:20 PM] nitram147#5106
Best way to aggregate random numbers from multiple parties would be to xor them together.


[08/17/2021 9:20 PM] nitram147#5106
However the numbers had to be choosen without a knowledge of other choosen numbers.


[08/17/2021 9:21 PM] nitram147#5106
And this part cannot be achieved, because oracle posting datapoints don't happen in one specific moment.


[08/17/2021 9:21 PM] nitram147#5106
Some pool participant will post them earlier, which means somebody will post it as last participant.


[08/17/2021 9:22 PM] nitram147#5106
He can then based on the previous numbers manipulate his own number to make the outcome number he want to make.


[08/17/2021 9:23 PM] Microproofs#4407
Yeah lack of synchronization is a major issue. And pools can only output an aggregated piece of data correct?


[08/17/2021 9:24 PM] nitram147#5106
Even if the random enetering rties were separate, if somebody knows the logic how your smartcontract will aggregate these numbers, he can always cheat.


[08/17/2021 9:25 PM] nitram147#5106
So from my point of view, the mining block hash or the super hashes would be much better solution.


[08/17/2021 9:25 PM] nitram147#5106
Maybe it will be worth looking how does cardano's verifiable random function for choosing of staking pools work

I've forked `ergo-node-interface` too and fixed the version of `ergo-lib` in dependencies...It seems this library just used `chain` module and there was no differences between v0.4.1 and v0.13.3 in this module...So I've just edited `ergo-lib` version and it built successfully...

[09/25/2021 10:46 PM] amsk#6884
Also I faced a major issue in current implementation of ERG/USD oracle pool...
Now the oracle who perform datapoint collection operation, pays about 0.011 ERG as tx fee in return he receives only 0.005 ERG as reward...
I think the collector should be paid more than double of paying price...And I think there will be an issue with transaction fees...
I was developing an oracle pool that supports string data type (or boolean, etc...) but in that case the transaction fee for `collect datapoints` operation will be much more and thus the cost of using this service will be high for smart contracts...


[09/26/2021 12:36 AM] abchris#8522
This is addressed in V2 it seems. The collector will get at least 5x more rewards than for a single datapoint posting.

What is the cost per transaction for ergo oracle vs chainlink oracles?


[09/29/2021 6:23 PM] amanadlakha#1734
Also if anyone could provide info on why to choose ergo oracle over chainlink  for development purpose


[09/29/2021 6:25 PM] glasgowm#9381
In the OP model, oracle providers all submit their data via a regular transaction, including the datapoint in some agreed format, such as within Cardano's transaction metadata.

The cost of providing this datapoint is a single transaction, but as we stated above each transaction in a EUTXO model can reference other UTXO's. The oracle provider references the entire pool's EUTXO when they submit their data (you can think of this as the pool's funds, or treasury), and this is how they get paid later, as described below.

Lastly, the oracle provider that accumulates and aggregates all the other oracles' data into a finalized transaction gets paid double. This incentivizes timely delivery and a reward for minting what can be thought of as a "mini-block".

[09/29/2021 10:04 PM] abchris#8522
If you were asking about the cost of using a datapoint, it's free. Once a pool produces a datapoint, anyone can include it in a transaction. There's no pay-per-query like in Chainlink.


[09/29/2021 10:05 PM] amanadlakha#1734
So how a developer or a smart contract pays for oracle?


[09/29/2021 10:07 PM] abchris#8522
With V1 the pool must be funded. If a dev's app generates revenue and relies on a certain oracle pool, he'll be incentivized to contribute to the pool funding.


[09/29/2021 10:08 PM] abchris#8522
With V2, same logic, except the oracles will redeem a token in exchange for ERG.


[09/29/2021 10:09 PM] amanadlakha#1734
Also is ergo oracle interoperable with other block chains as chain link is. If not are there any plans for it to become one?

Chainlinks 'Chain Agnostism' seems to be that they don't prefer any blockchain on a ethical level - but it still needs APIs coded so the fees can be paid I think for new chains.

Chainlink also uses same logic as oracle pool for it's price feeds...There are some sponsors that pay for oracles and every one can use data that exists in `latestAnswer` freely...


[09/30/2021 10:55 AM] amsk#6884
Also there is another issue in V1...It seems there is not any way to ensure the collector folded all successful boxes in `collecting transaction`...Am I right?...
In other words, the collectors can fold only a limited number of successful boxes in `collecting transaction` (equal to minimum consensus) and ignore other successful boxes...So they pay less transaction fee for this action...

ADA is integrating ETH feeds for their developers - was always the plan. Oracle Pools is a eUTXO design for oracle pools which will be available on ada yes.

With the eth bridge coming up I was thinking it could be good "advertising" to have an eth/usd oracle up and running? I was amazed at how easy and well documented the oracle-core repo is so my hands are itchy to try and bootstrap an eth/usd oracle. How much does it cost to keep an oracle running? I figured maybe we could keep it running with community funding through a raffle.

I don't think so...It's seems there is no schedule to update `latestAnswer` in price feeds...


[10/15/2021 4:47 PM] amsk#6884
That will be a nice idea...This will encourages the collector to fold all valid datapoints to earn maximum reward...
Then the only restricting factor would be the cost of service...In chainlink minimum fee for each request to get  currency price (Prices that are not exist in price feed) is 0.1 LINK I think...

[10/31/2021 1:43 AM] weirdhousenoisesat837pmeveryday#4778
For instance, if I had a smart contract that needed eth/usd and btc/usd, would you save on transaction fees by looking at a single oracle containing both rates rather than looking up each rate individually in separate oracles?

Don't think you need such an oracle as you can just include the boxes of multiple oracles (in your case eth/usd and btc/usd) into a single transaction.

[11/01/2021 1:21 PM] weirdhousenoisesat837pmeveryday#4778
But wouldn’t it become impractical once you start talking about tens or hundreds of data points? The eth/usd and btc/usd was just an example. What about for instance 5-minute  real time energy prices, would you need an oracle for each 5 minute interval in a day?


[11/01/2021 1:22 PM] weirdhousenoisesat837pmeveryday#4778
Or could you set up a single oracle to pull an array of 5 minute prices at the end of a day (or hour, or 15 minute interval, etc)?


[11/01/2021 8:11 PM] abchris#8522
I don't see how it is impractical, it's not like you have to do it manually or something 🙂

In any case, the problem remains. Someone has to to merge those 100 boxes into a single tx. It's either gonna be you or a higher level oracle.

Also, if going the oracle route, you'd have to modify the current oracle pool smart contracts to support arrays instead of single values and come up with deviation checking for arrays.


[11/01/2021 8:58 PM] weirdhousenoisesat837pmeveryday#4778
Thanks for elaborating. I have a lot to learn 😬 For deviation check of arrays of discrete numbers perhaps a hash of the numbers in the array could be used.


[11/01/2021 9:04 PM] abchris#8522
True if you need all arrays to be identical. Oracle pools typically allow for some deviation, which a hash wouldn't allow. But I guess identical arrays make sense if your only aggregating stuff that's already on chain.

Another thought is that if your smart contract doesn't actually require the full array but just a statistic derived from it, you could move the aggregation off-chain into each oracle's connector.


[11/01/2021 9:46 PM] weirdhousenoisesat837pmeveryday#4778
Since the underlying data points that I have in mind are not subjective, but rather a reported number from a trusted source, I think intuitively I would be OK not allowing for any deviation.

[11/15/2021 7:33 PM] abchris#8522
The current tooling isn't there yet, so you'd have to build it yourself. But not sure if oracles are the best way to go here, you'd still have the risk of double booking rooms. NFT's can probably help in that regard.

@Luivatra Can you bootstrap me to the ethusd pool？

I was doing research in oracles, just to see if I understand, I can make a oracle(inside the oraclepool or wtv) that straight up pull data from an API like the CoinGeckoAPI and that is it?


[11/22/2021 7:48 AM] andee#4722
that is a basic example of an oracle, I dont get what you are really asking though. it is not limited to querying one API and publishing (if that was your questions)


[11/22/2021 12:14 PM] Hamilton#4703
My question was about the minimum effort to make the oracle, cause I was wondering why we don't have more than 2 pools, lack of demand? Also, this brings me to 2 other questions, imagine that I have a stock API and I get the prices of Microsoft and Apple, are these two different oracles or this information can be put in one?


[11/22/2021 12:15 PM] Hamilton#4703
And, about the transactions, running the oracle would be free and the application running the oracle would pay for transactions? I am little confused on the money part


[11/22/2021 12:43 PM] glasgowm#9381
- Lack of demand when you can usually pull from a centralised source for free
- v2 solves some issues and bugs which make v1 not worthwhile (can cost you more to run than you receive back in fees)
- Documentation/frameworks - while the oracle cool documentation is thorough - it's not been simplified yet and there aren't many connectors premade (ada/erg/eth are available) 
- Running the oracle is free, dApps querying the price pay a small fee each time I believe

Thanks, oracles are my new favorite thing in crypto and I'm trying to understand the possibilities and possible making it, although, for now, I'm just understanding the technicals


[11/22/2021 12:56 PM] glasgowm#9381
Forgot to answer your microsoft one - I suppose you could put an array but every other oracle in the pool would need it too


[11/22/2021 1:06 PM] Hamilton#4703
I see, I imagined that would be inconvenient, if people wants one data, they would need to request all and then just use one


[11/22/2021 7:13 PM] abchris#8522
About fees, a pool will keep running as long as it's funded. Once a datapoint is live, anyone can use it for free (i.e. include it in a tx). Anyone can fund a pool, so if you have a dapp that relies on one, you'll be incentivised to fund it.

[11/22/2021 7:15 PM] abchris#8522
If there's a Microsoft and an Apple pool, you can just include the datapoints from both pools into a single tx. You could but don't need to have a dedicated pool that aggregates those into an array first.


[11/23/2021 12:09 AM] Hamilton#4703
I see, a little bit different than I thought


[11/23/2021 12:09 AM] Hamilton#4703
Understood


[12/08/2021 6:33 AM] M. Zuiko#5537
Hey quick question is there an example of settings for an oracle that's bootstrapped on the testnet. Can someone DM me the  person who did the ETH/USD oracle.


[12/08/2021 6:40 AM] abchris#8522
@Luivatra


[12/08/2021 7:22 AM] Luivatra#9076
I dont think there is any difference other than using a testnet node rather than a mainnet one


[12/09/2021 3:02 PM] M. Zuiko#5537
I’ve been on the road for work but tonight I might have a couple questions if you don’t mind @Luivatra


[12/09/2021 3:49 PM] Luivatra#9076
Just hope I have the answers 🙂

is the oracle pool mainly CPU based, which means you could run it in parallel to the GPU mining rigs?


[01/04/2022 10:16 PM] abchris#8522
Yes, oracle cores don't need much resources really, all they do is fetch data and post transactions


[01/04/2022 10:27 PM] TCAPLLC#0897
So why are not more people that are already mining running oracle nodes? The only thing preventing me from doing that is that I haven’t found a guide to set one up yet


[01/05/2022 5:38 AM] nox071218#1778
i just came to this section to find out how i can help out. i'm currently tryign to spin up my own node, have miners going, but i've always been interested in helping the pool


[01/05/2022 5:57 AM] nox071218#1778
so i can run on a pi?


[01/05/2022 5:59 AM] nox071218#1778
https://github.com/ergoplatform/oracle-core this might help. I'm going to try and spin one up over the weekend if you try and run into issue let me know... maybe we can help each other out

The oracle core alone, sure, but it needs access to a node as well. Pretty sure a node will run smoothly on an 8GB pi, and I think some have had success on a 4GB pi with some tweaks.


[01/05/2022 7:18 AM] abchris#8522
Because they aren't needed, yet.
The oracles contributing to a pool are determined upon pool creation, so you can't just join a pool that is already running. Anyone is free to create a pool and distribute tokens to whomever they want to contribute as individual oracles, but if there's no need for the pool, no one is going to fund it.
As dapps flourish, the need for additional oracle pools will increase


[01/05/2022 7:23 AM] abchris#8522
I've been pondering the idea of some kind of platform to bring together people wanting to run oracle cores and others wanting to spin up pools and looking for oracle operators. That and some other things related to oracle pools (lowering technical barrier, implementing missing features etc.). Need to put some more thoughts on paper but might post something in #🤝│i-need-a-team  for the next hackathon.

I'll have to dig in but I was thinking I'd set my nose up on an older computer and connect via the pi to do oracle things.. have to dig in like I said


[01/05/2022 8:14 AM] abchris#8522
That should work fine


[01/09/2022 2:43 PM] Luivatra#9076
Agree, but just so you know what is decided upon pool creation is how many oracles there should be in the pool as a minimum and how many oracle tokens are minted (max possible oracles). Actual onboarding of oracles into the pool happens later

Hello,

I am trying to setup a erg-usd pool to learn some more about the details of oracles. Ive bootstrapped multiple times but the create new epoch tx keeps failing. 
Does anyone have any suggestions as to what could be going wrong? 
Ive set the pool up such that I am the only datapoint provider.

I've been reading about oracle-pools for an editorial post. Super interesting stuff. I also found this recent Rekt article: https://rekt.news/inverse-finance-rekt/

Am I right in thinking that Ergo Oracle-Pools would have prevented this attack as it would have been much more difficult for the attacker to inflate data from multiple oracles?

Is this a 'good' example of the security issues behind point-to-point oracles and the need for oracle-pools?
