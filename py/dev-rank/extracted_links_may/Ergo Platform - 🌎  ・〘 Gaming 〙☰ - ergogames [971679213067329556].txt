Did you guys airdrop some EGIO? I can see 1000 in my wallet even though I haven't redeemed anything yet


[05/11/2022 3:19 PM] AlexisE#0000
[thread]: I guess you were one of those who registred for the airdrop

Send the vesting key and some erg back to your main wallet

Let's draw attention guys let's make noise on Twitter if we collaborate as a community we do something

 The power of marketing is done by users, not money

Staking for $EGIO is live and can be found here: https://ergopad.io/staking/egio

The first emission date will be Saturday, June 25, 2022. You can read more about staking and our tokenomics on our whitepaper here: https://ergogames.gitbook.io/ergogames.io/token/usdegio-token

There are several benefits to staking your $EGIO including:
üí∞ Get some great APY on your staked $EGIO tokens.
üèÖ Qualify for a Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum staking tier to qualify for Tiered Exclusive NFT Airdrops, private access game keys, white listings, exclusive events and many other perks to come. 
üñºÔ∏è The first Exclusive Tiered NFT Airdrop will occur on July 2nd, with a snapshot occurring 24 hours prior to the drop. The higher your tier, the higher the rarity of NFT dropped.
üñ•Ô∏è Staked $EGIO will have voting power in the future and staked users can use their staking keys to shape ErgoGames.io‚Äôs vision, future projects and other key issues.

Some important notes you should know!
1Ô∏è‚É£ Staking will lock your $EGIO tokens into a smart contract for 8 weeks with an early unstaking penalty that decreases over time. After 8 weeks there is no penalty for unstaking.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Even if you don‚Äôt qualify for a Staking Tier (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) you will still get the same APY on your staked $EGIO.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Once you stake, make sure your transaction is confirmed and you receive your staking key. If multiple people try to stake at the exact same time, often one of the transactions will fail to process and the $EGIO will need to be restaked. If this happens, you will not lose any tokens but simply will have to try to stake again.

[06/24/2022 10:10 PM] Daedalus#0000
looking at the egio page, we cant add new tokens to the current ongoing stake key, only create a new stake key


[06/24/2022 10:10 PM] Daedalus#0000
does this affect the staking tiers?


[06/24/2022 10:11 PM] Daedalus#0000
if multiple stake keys are hold to achieve any of the tiers?


[06/24/2022 10:11 PM] Daedalus#0000
or should we unstake and restake


[06/24/2022 10:30 PM] theta_decay#0000
Because egio has unstaking penalties, it's not possible to add stake to pre existing keys. Multiple keys at the same address will be counted together to help reach the highest tier possible. Keys at different addresses will not.


[06/24/2022 10:31 PM] theta_decay#0000
When unstaking egio, please be aware of what penalties apply at that time.


[06/24/2022 10:32 PM] Daedalus#0000
Just saw that, apologies haha!
Thanks for explaining tho üòÑ


[06/26/2022 2:29 PM] Betquity#0000
So We need to unstake now? otherwise our coins are stuck?


[06/26/2022 2:30 PM] Betquity#0000
Eat the fees, then ask for a rembursemtn?


[06/26/2022 2:49 PM] Betquity#0000
@theta_decayDo you advise everyone to unstake? Is the current program unrecoverable?


[06/26/2022 3:42 PM] theta_decay#0000
Yes, that's correct. The current staking contract cannot distribute emissions.


[06/26/2022 3:59 PM] Betquity#0000
@theta_decay okay so what are the expectations here for the 25% penalty?


[06/26/2022 3:59 PM] Betquity#0000
How are we going to get rembursed and whats the wait?


[06/26/2022 4:01 PM] theta_decay#0000
Will be reimbursed via airdrop. Don't have a time frame. Did you see the medium article? There's a link in #üì¢-announcements-üì¢


[06/26/2022 4:01 PM] Betquity#0000
can you just fwd the clock on the database running the staking and then automatically unstake everyone?


[06/26/2022 4:01 PM] Betquity#0000
I did read the article.


[06/26/2022 4:01 PM] Betquity#0000
but since things are very fluid here now days I figured a direct conversation would be best.


[06/26/2022 4:02 PM] theta_decay#0000
No objection to that.


[06/26/2022 4:03 PM] theta_decay#0000
The smart contract for staking is immutable.


[06/26/2022 4:04 PM] theta_decay#0000
So we have to switch over to the v2 contract.


[06/26/2022 4:05 PM] Betquity#0000
I'll wait till the contract is ready before unstaking


[06/26/2022 4:05 PM] theta_decay#0000
Yes, this is no problem.


[06/27/2022 7:12 PM] Daedalus#0000

[06/27/2022 7:51 PM] theta_decay#0000
Do you have enough erg for the tx fee?


[06/27/2022 8:52 PM] Daedalus#0000
The error shows up without the nautilus password request opening


[06/27/2022 9:21 PM] theta_decay#0000
Ok, but the same question still applies.


[06/27/2022 9:25 PM] theta_decay#0000
Assuming you have enough erg, please send the stake key you wish to unstake, plus a few erg to yourself in one tx. This will consolidate the key & your erg into one utxo. Then retry your unstaking tx. Please let me know if for some reason the unstake does not work for you after doing this utxo consolidation. Thanks very much.


[06/28/2022 7:43 AM] Daedalus#0000
Did have some ergo, tried sending the keys to myself and this seemed to have fixed it. thanks alot!


[06/28/2022 10:20 AM] zackbeaven#0000
Gonna jump on and stake my egio in a min, anyone know if I can stake vested tokens?


[06/28/2022 1:50 PM] AlexisE#0000
Staking is not available for EGIO yet


[06/28/2022 6:50 PM] Szabber#0000
Hi there! Should i need to unstake my egio with penalties, and stake later when new contract is ready? Thanks


[06/28/2022 6:58 PM] theta_decay#0000
Yes, please do. You will be reimbursed the penalty amount via airdrop.


[07/01/2022 12:28 AM] Betquity#0000
Hey, The staking page is still up and going it looks like? Is the reason because everyone needs to be able to unstake?


[07/01/2022 12:28 AM] Betquity#0000
I'm a just bit confused...


[07/01/2022 3:41 AM] theta_decay#0000

[07/01/2022 3:43 AM] theta_decay#0000
It's disabled for me.


[07/01/2022 12:09 PM] Betquity#0000
I see that it is disable. I also see there still is still almost 10 millions coins locked. Do you think you guys can create a url portal that allows for those who have unstaked to claim their penalized coins in an official and organized manner?


[07/01/2022 1:20 PM] AlexisE#0000
It some of them unstakes, we'll track it by our script and reimburse their coins the day after.


[07/01/2022 4:33 PM] theta_decay#0000
No need to claim the burnt tokens from unstaking. We airdrop them to you. 2 rounds of refund tx's have already been distributed. If you have not unstaked, you can do so now & you will see your burnt tokens refunded as Alexis mentioned within a day or two.


[07/01/2022 5:37 PM] Kevin leo#0000
Are the ones still staking are they getting 300% APY right now..any idea or time frame when can start staking again for the ones that are unstaked already


[07/01/2022 5:47 PM] theta_decay#0000
The v1 staking contract is not emitting rewards. That is why we're moving over to v2 staking. So people who are still staked using the v1 contract are receiving 0% apy.


[07/01/2022 5:48 PM] theta_decay#0000
v2 staking for egio is being tested. Official launch will be soon.


[07/01/2022 5:58 PM] Kevin leo#0000
Awesome thanks


[07/02/2022 12:18 PM] Tostibrand#0000
was wondering why no emissions, just unstaked. would be nice if you put a message on the egio ergpad staking page not to stake atm


[07/02/2022 2:43 PM] theta_decay#0000
Sorry about that Tostibrand. There is a message on the egio ergopad staking page stating that staking is disabled . We also posted announcements here in discord & in telegram. Additionally we publishing a medium article describing what the problem was. But you're right perhaps the note on the staking page could be more noticeable & clearer.


[07/02/2022 2:44 PM] Tostibrand#0000
no harm done, spend 1 erg to swap to egio to rty out

yeah i only really check the staking page to see how its doing once i stake


[07/04/2022 8:43 PM] Dilly Dallier#0000
I was looking at the tokenomics section for EGIO on the Ergopad website.  It seems like the total distribution states 850 million tokens, but when adding them up I got closer to 580 million tokens.  Not sure if this was clarified already, but I couldn't find an answer here.  What is the total number of EGIO when they are all distributed?


[07/04/2022 9:23 PM] theta_decay#0000
Sorry about that Dilly, this is an oversight on our part. These were updated long ago & should be reflected as so on our platform. We'll correct this right away. In the meantime let me give you the correct tokenomics.

@theta_decay If I unstake my broken egio coins now how do I go about getting back me penalized coins?


[07/07/2022 2:12 AM] theta_decay#0000
We run a script that records all unstake tx's from ergio staking v1.


[07/07/2022 2:14 AM] theta_decay#0000
Then every 48hrs we send out reimbursement tx's to everyone.


[07/07/2022 2:14 AM] theta_decay#0000
Then every 48hrs we send out reimbursement tx's to everyone who unstaked.


[07/07/2022 2:16 AM] theta_decay#0000
If you unstake now you'll probably get your reimbursement tomorrow, if I'm not mistaken.


[07/07/2022 2:43 AM] Betquity#0000
@theta_decay is it automatic, or will I need to submit some proof to you directly of the amounts?


[07/07/2022 3:19 AM] theta_decay#0000
We are tracking it. You can save your tx ID & screen capture your unstaking, for your own piece of mind. I did. But it's not required.


[07/07/2022 3:19 AM] Lgmeister#0000
thanks for clearing all this up @theta_decay !

@newn No problem. Yes you can try to unstake both. They are the same amount, but the keys have different token id's. Please let me know if you have any trouble.

During the holiday charity stream, not only will we be giving away prizes, but we'll also be creating the fastest ever community built video game. From the ground up we'll be creating a video game built by you the Ergonaut community. 

100% of the proceeds will be donated to DirectRelief.org

Donations get you into the raffle drawings, and let you affect the way the game is built.

The Charity Live Stream is just a few short days away! Again I'm crossing my fingers for Dan Friedman to show up during the stream. We spoke last week and he did want to attend but it would be 3AM in Thailand so his words were "We'll see what happens."

 Aside from that hopeful news, there will also be many exciting prizes given out during the live stream.

:trophy:Raffle Prizes Include:
- 3 @ErgoPadOfficial Rocket Boy NFTs
- @PixelyErgo Mummy NFT
- @CyberVerse_io NFT
- @ERGoatWineClub NFT
- Total of 700,000 $EGIO

This and several more prizes including a piece of art created during stream will be raffled with 100% of the proceeds going to charity!

Live Stream Poll:

We are building a game with input from all the ErgoGames.io members during the stream. Visit the Discord and vote on what type of game youd like to see made. Votes can be made in the #Poll channel. Hope to see everyone at this exciting event. CHEERS.ü•Ç

If any of you folks get a moment, please upvote the Charity live stream Reddit post. A lot of people within the crypto community converse on reddit, and this is one of the best ways to get exposure outside of the Ergo space. We appreciate all your support.

It's almost here! Many guests will be attending, and we're all playing a community game of CS:GO. We'll have a game during stream with all of your favorite Ergo devs, and later open it up to the community. If you want to participate in the fun please download "Counter Strike Go." The game is free and only requires a steam account and a working internet connection.

Note: We all live in very different regions so latency may be an issue for some. We may switch around servers, but we currently plan to play on US WEST servers. This stream is of course all for fun so latency or not, I'm sure we'll all have a great time.

If you havn't already, get your vote in for the game build in the #‚è≥poll channel on discord. Let's raise some money for a good cause! Hope to see everyone on stream. CHEERS

Ergonauts, The "Empire of Pixely Ergo" Alpha is coming in January!

If you haven't checked them out, Pixely Ergo is the creator of Ergo mummies and have been developing an Ergo blockchain game for about a year now. The team has done some incredible work and now its time to show it off to the community!

We've teamed up with Pixely Ergo to bring the alpha experience to $EGIO stakers. Platinum, and Gold tier stakers will have access to the very first public build of the game. Stake your tokens, the snapshot will be taken within the next week.

everyone enjoy this alpha event by Pixely Ergo. Myself and a couple other Ergonauts had a chance to see an early build of the game during our holiday charity stream the other week. The team @ Pixely Ergo has been working hard and it shows. We're really looking forward to playing the most current build, and we hope you are too.

Forwarded from ErgoGames.io Annoucements: Quick update on the Pixely Ergo Alpha key NFTs. The snapshot has been made as stated earlier, and will be distributed before the release. 

Lgmeister had a child several days ago and as you can imagine, he‚Äôs been busy these last couple of days with the baby. 

We are happy to see this upturn in the market as I think we‚Äôve all been hurting a bit. With this influx more eyes are looking at viable blockchains to move over to, and Ergo is bringing a lot to the table. 

If you‚Äôre on Twitter please support Ergo and make yourself heard.  Like and retweet posts you find informative about our blockchain and try to start conversations with groups from other blockchains. This will ultimately do wonders for Ergo.

Thanks for your support Ergonauts.

 So far platinum stakers have received audio NFTs, ergo mummies in a raffle we held, and an alpha key that will be dropped this week. There will be future NFTs as well. Possibly something Cyberverse.


[01/17/2023 8:57 PM] MDMTXO#0000

Can‚Äôt guarantee at the moment but we have worked close with them over the past 6 months or so and do want to do something special with their team.

will there be any announcement before the snapshot ?

yeah we'll always have announcments before we take our snapshots. We dont specify exact time and day so people dont stake then unstake just to get NFTs. The most recent snapshot for the Ergo Mummies Alpha has already been taken. Distribution will happen this week.

 I think someone from Ergopad team can answer you. 
AFAIK you can‚Äôt see separately the rewards. It just tops up with what you already have. 
Just compare the picture you sent today with the picture you sent some time ago, and you will see the difference. You can see your total staked EGIO is bigger and each stake key has more tokens. I‚Äôm comparing your pictures before your recent purchase of 600,000

 Yes platinum tier have received NFTs in past drops and will get more in the future.


[01/18/2023 5:13 PM] MDMTXO#0000
which NFT


[01/18/2023 5:17 PM] Ergogames#0000
(re @Gazza_SP : *Most chats are dead these days, it's painful to try get engagement going during the bear! I feel their pain!! üòÇ*) 
 
 Yes, it is unfortunate, but during the bear market people aren‚Äôt as vocal, which is understandable.

We do have a wonderful community the ‚ÄúScreaming ERGoat Wine Club,‚Äù which has regular interaction daily in the discord server. Definitely check it out if you‚Äôre on discord, and want to chat with some of your fellow Ergonauts about crypto related things or really anything. The ERGoat community has been solid and vocal through these tough times.


[01/18/2023 5:22 PM] Ergogames#0000
(re @MDMTXO : *which NFT*) 
 
 The next drops will most likely be Monster Pub Brawl or Digigoats because they are our own properties and we can‚Äôt guarantee NFTs from other projects at this time. We work very closely with Empire of Pixely Ergo and Cyberverse and they are both interested in future collabs, but at this time it‚Äôs to early to determine the next NFT drop.

are diggigoats and screaming ergoat the same ?


[01/18/2023 5:31 PM] MDMTXO#0000
(re @Ergogames : *The next drops will most likely be Monster Pub Brawl or Digigoats because they are our own properties and we can‚Äôt guarantee NFTs from other projects at this time. We work very closely with Empire of Pixely Ergo and Cyberverse and they are both interested in future collabs, but at this time it‚Äôs to early to determine the next NFT drop.*) 
 
 yeah i just wanted to make sure that platinum are guaranteed and not raffle or a draw or something


[01/18/2023 5:31 PM] Ergogames#0000
(re @MDMTXO : *are diggigoats and screaming ergoat the same ?*) 
 
 Yeah Digigoats is the game being built for Screaming ERGoat Wine Club.


[01/18/2023 5:33 PM] MDMTXO#0000
aren't ergoat sold out ? if yes than what kind of drop the diggigoat be ?


[01/18/2023 5:37 PM] Ergogames#0000
(re @MDMTXO : *yeah i just wanted to make sure that platinum are guaranteed and not raffle or a draw or something*) 
 
 Yes plat have gotten NFTs and will continue to do so for our titles, and maybe from other projects if we happen to do a collab. For instance we have been entertaining ideas with the Cyberverse guys.

Many games are set to release this year and as these games release on Ergo there will be more NFTs as there will be games that can utilize them.


[01/18/2023 5:48 PM] Ergogames#0000
(re @MDMTXO : *aren't ergoat sold out ? if yes than what kind of drop the diggigoat be ?*) 
 
 Yes all 1003 have been minted, but there will be on full release, NFTs associated with the game. We will not be minting more goats at this time, but we do have a community voting system that utilizes ERGoats, and it allows our community to sway project decisions. A vote will be made at some point deciding whether to mint and drop a different kind of goat that may have different uses within the game when compared to an ERGoat NFT. 

When the market picks up and we have more eyes on  Ergo we may decide to mint Gen 2 ERGoats, but this would be a vote that NFT holders will make not just a decision made solely by our team.

(re @Joabisaza : *Guys, any plans for the future to list it in some cex*) 
 
 I was looking into Hotbit and sent in applications and all the appropriate processes, but they were having issues that at this time I can‚Äôt recall in what way. I have waited for responses but haven‚Äôt heard anything. Their Telegram is filled with bots and we are not sure they are a group we want to work with. We will continue in the future to get on a CEX, but in this market it is not priority number one.

 Clearly in a bear market it is not a priority, the priority must be the growth of products and projects and developments. but my question is, have you raised this issue for the bull market?

 Preach Gazza. The crypto winter freezes more than just market cap.  With this rally maybe more engagement comes. The team here has been great about updates. Appreciated.

 It is in our sights yes, and it‚Äôs somewhat of a matter of finding an appropriate CEX that will help grow ErgoGames.io. When the market recovers there will most likely be a direction that will make sense for the company based on public sentiment and what aligns with Ergo‚Äôs development. While I do want to get all the prerequisites in order to get on a CEX in a brisk manner, I don‚Äôt want to make the decision haphazardly just to say our token is on one.

I feel Ergo hyped the tier one exchange listing a bit too much to the detriment of our blockchain.

 I‚Äôm very happy to hear our work has not gone unheard. Thanks for the support, and please this goes to everyone, share the project and tell them about what we‚Äôre doing here. The gaming industry is booming, and we believe there are many ways blockchain utilization can and will further enhance the gaming space.

 This often happens due to pressure from investors. What I do believe is that it is necessary to find a list so that there is more support for the project at an economic level as long as there is

 I am very aware of that and the truth is that it is what I liked about this project that despite everything they continue working, I know of better-known projects that had a lot of popularity and today


[01/18/2023 10:50 PM] Joabisaza#0000
Administrators do not even say hello and many closed the channels, for example LOVELACE that had such a boom in cardano But they ended up being a SCAM and they have a large audience that expects something from them.

And I appreciate that you, being smaller and less known and with less capital, are working and updating that makes one feel like continuing to accumulate and support the pr


[01/18/2023 10:52 PM] Joabisaza#0000
I hope that when the time comes they will make themselves known to many people and use the multi-chain to also promote themselves with Cardano. It would be a good idea to take advantage of that great community to promote the project.In due course, although I also hope that ergo becomes bigger along with cardano, thank you very much for answering that you are well and cheers are going very well

2023 is shaping up to be a fantastic year. In 2022 Ergo saw an incredible amount of development within the community, and we expect as much if not more development in this new year. Everyone's had their own struggles with the market being what it is, and we appreciate the continued support.

It's with the help of the community that Ergo will get itself on the map in 2023. We are seeing more interactions within the community, and with the recent uptick in the crypto market this has been even more apparent. That being said, Ergo has lots to offer and it's up to us to give the information needed to bring new people into our blockchain.

Please share this post w/ friends, and let's show everyone the power of the Ergo blockchain.

Morning ErgoGames.io Members. The market has seen a bit of a shift, and the NFT market has seen some increased interest. We expect a lot more movement very soon as big names like Blitz TCG, Cyberverse, ERGoat Wine Club's Digigoats, and our very own Monster Pub Brawl video games release. This is a great time to get in as once the games release we see prices skyrocket, Ergo Mummies being an example of this.

Skyharbor.io has been a huge player in the NFT scene here on Ergo and we encourage you to please Like RT the following post to further extend the reaches of our blockchain.

it is not hard accusation if in 15 days it drops 50% and apparently the team is selling


[02/08/2023 8:48 AM] MDMTXO#0000
but don't mind me it seems this week i have an aggressive way the share my thoughts


[02/08/2023 8:57 AM] Lgmeister#0000
We def did not cause a 50% drop, we did not sell very much.


[02/08/2023 8:58 AM] Lgmeister#0000
we make sure that what we sell doesn't impact the price to the point of hurting people


[02/08/2023 8:59 AM] Lgmeister#0000
We will try and be a little more transparant I suppose in what we do with our funding


[02/08/2023 8:59 AM] Lgmeister#0000
we still have to pay the bills


[02/08/2023 9:01 AM] MDMTXO#0000
last week of January it was 9 to 10k per 1 erg
3 selloff of about 7.4 million Egio happened a total of about 21M 
each sell dropped the amount by 2K


[02/08/2023 9:03 AM] Lgmeister#0000
I will have to look at the numbers. We will try and be much more conscientious of the price

The move is several days out, and will take another couple days to get the internet service up and running at the new place. Thanks for understanding, we look forward to where the next bull market takes us üìà
