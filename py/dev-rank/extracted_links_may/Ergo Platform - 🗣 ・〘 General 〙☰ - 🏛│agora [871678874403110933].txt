[08/03/2021 12:05 AM] ErgoBridge#8937
[telegram] <Ron> i'm defnitely on the opposite spectrum of marxism, but people regularly get wrong what marx was describing. he was describing what will happen to society when capitalism collapses. we haven't experienced this yet (re @TIMRŒ£G7: The manifesto is worth reading. It's an interesting exercise to read something like that and then figure out why it's not appropriate)


[08/03/2021 12:05 AM] ErgoBridge#8937

[telegram] <Paul1903> Thats a reasonable philosophy, i try go by the same, probably have a spritz of wokeness but am big on freedom, respect peoples right to expression and freedom even if i strongly disagree, aslong as its not infringing others.
Those conversations are always the messiest and dirtiest, tho are somewhat needed but on level of reason, not like us talking politics and religion is particularly productive here anyway.
A mix of personal experience and my understanding of history leaves me a little more sceptical of catholicism then others.

[matrix] <turadh> The money printing will slow down, Consumer credit is maxed out and many are keen to borrow no more until debts are paid off. If inflation rises too highly interest rates may rise to combat this. Credit is key in this debate, we wont get hyperinflation without a boom in credit.

Worst case scenario: inflation spikes, triggering an economic depression, markets crash, businesses fold, money has no value and people begin trading only valuable assets mainly food and we walk round with crossbows on our backs. Crypto currency is forgotten about.
This scenario is the extreme and unlikely but cant be ignored all the same.

Best case Scenario: (more likely IMO) Inflation goes up but not too fast, workers and institutions diversify and adapt to post COVID life. The dollar is protected by global markets, in particular the Chinese manufacturing might which relies heavily on the dollar. People look for alternatives to the Dollar based markets and adopt Crypto as part of their lives, which in turn strengthens the economy and becomes a safety net for times when other markets and currencies falter.

[telegram] <TypoDaPsycho> You think some things don't belong in the free market? or cryptocurrency market? (re @TIMRŒ£G7: I think we are just recognizing that some things don't belong in the market and trying to find that balance. Healthcare & insurance are potential examples. More broadly tho, I think crypto is a good response to improving access to the economy)

[telegram] <glasgowm> TAX AND REGULATION
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knjRukXxDuU&t=6113s
Tax and regs are hugely current as we see the SEC (securities and exchange commission) investigating XRP and Tether and now we see Binance under huge pressure to comply with regs.
Now lets be straight this is nothing but bullish for Crypto Currency in general. There would not be tax and regs for something that was going away, its a sign of mass, mainstream and institutional adoption, and it stops the fear and guilt many have of using Bitcoin due to imagined consequences. I know people in the UK who still believe Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining is illegal!!
The Binance issue is very current, suddenly Binance futures is shutting down in Europe, (Germany, Netherlands and Italy) and this will surely spread to the UK sooner rather than later. Now Im gonna be highly speculative and give my opinion on this (buy the rumour, sell the news) I reckon Binance has been asked to comply and share information with governing bodies to avoid laundering and fraud and allow trading to be taxed. Binance have shit themselves and have started a retreat until they can figure a way to comply and keep the wolf from the door. Coinbase being American seems to have no issues (other than it being crap to trade on) and seems to be the pet of the SEC.
So currently we have capital gains tax where in UK profits over ¬£12.5k are taxed. This counts for Crypto gains, but Crypto gives the ability to avoid this tax and currently get away with it. This looks set to change, especially in terms of trading on exchanges and we are likely gonna see exchanges regulated and taxed just like stock market exchanges. What the governments want is to tax and monitor trades like they do with Paypal.
The linked video (Uponly TV, one of my goto) features an interview with a new SEC director who is on the case to get Crypto regulated. Hes not anti Crypto as such, but mainly just wants his s <clipped message>

[telegram] <fruittree> I have been wondering if we could see survey options or some kind of decentralized governance management incorporated into the LETS. I think surveys could be almost enough as LETS relies on the users to vet users, and then this facilitates communication about governance topics within a community as well as the trading of value as the main purpose of LETS.

Gensler's statement to the Senate tomorrow:

1. Crypto exchanges are selling what we believe are securities;
2. "Make no mistake," we are coming after crypto exchanges;
3. There will be no warning shots or "clarification" first.

The glove was thrown, and now... the Gauntlet.

Only a country ran by lobbyist and crony capitalism could come up with a such a ridiculous list of "commodities".

[telegram] <glasgowm> ‚ÄúIn the old generation of POW, hard forks usually lead to community splits. In Ergo, miners can change parameters on the fly in their configs and 50%+ of blocks mined within 1024 blocks epoch need to be for raising/lowering the limit of some parameter, then it will be changed by 1% in next epoch. It can be block size, computational cost, storage fee factor and many more. Above comment for the old generation doesn't mention that core developers are 3rd party also. With Ergo`s design, when all basic assumptions are correct, network should adapt in time to changing environment without the intervention of any trusted parties.‚Äù - mx

[telegram] <glasgowm> "Hardforking policy
Ergo is trying to avoid hard-forks. Emission, proof-of-work, basics of transactional model and other core things should not be changed at all as any change about core parts of design means another chain. However, developers may propose hard-forks within first 12 months if (and only if):
a hard-fork is about security fixes only. The only exception is about making cost of particular instructions adjustable via miners voting, which was planned but not delivered in the current mainnet.
a hard-fork is supported by 90+% of miners.
a hard-fork is not breaking old contracts, freezing or moving any funds."

[telegram] <Autolykos> Miami‚Äôs mayor wants to turn his city into the world‚Äôs crypto capital. ‚ÄúMagic City‚Äù made history this month by accepting $7M (and counting) in gift contributions generated by MiamiCoin (‚Äú$MIA‚Äù), a blockchain-based currency operated by nonprofit CityCoins. 
Not to be outdone, a mayor in Tennessee is advocating for local government to ‚Äúlead the way in #Bitcoin adoption.‚Äù 
Across the country, the mayor of Reno, Nevada, is a self-professed Chainlink ‚Äúmarine‚Äù and is betting big on blockchain. Entrepreneurs in that state are proposing a modern day utopia entirely run on blockchain technology.
In California, San Francisco is expected to be the next launch for CityCoins (which is also eyeing New York, Austin, Singapore, and Seoul). And the city of Berkeley is considering issuing bonds on blockchain.
Elsewhere in the world, Seoul‚Äôs mayor floated the idea of creating its own digital currency, called S-coins, that could fund social welfare programs; two Belgian cities allow people to pay parking tickets with Bitcoin; and Bitcoin ATMs are opening across Latin America.
Countries are also getting into action. 
El Salvador‚Äîwhere citizens sending money home from abroad account for up to a fifth of the country‚Äôs GDP‚Äîbecame the first to adopt Bitcoin as a national currency. Now, a long list of other countries are exploring whether to follow their lead.
Dubai, The Bahamas, Sweden, and Nigeria have all launched their own digital currency, called ‚Äúcentral bank digital currency‚Äù (CBDC). Now, 81 countries are exploring doing the same.
Not all is rosey in crypto land, though. 
China, which has its own digital currency, issued a clampdown on all crypto transactions and mining, and Iran banned crypto mining following power outages.
U.S. regulators are also starting to ask questions about stablecoins, concerned they could...disrupt the financial system (after all, isn‚Äôt that the point?).

His claim about NiPoPoWs is wrong.
They've been shown to work for variable difficulty in future work after the original NiPoPoW paper (he's just quoting the Fly Client paper)
In our Ergo Cast episode on NiPoPoWs there's a lot of info about the benefits/tradeoffs between NiPoPoWs and FlyClient (they're both technically NiPoPoWs)

[10/02/2021 3:07 PM] ErgoBridge#8937
[telegram] <Kramerica Industries> takeaways seemed to be (1) NiPoPoWs can also handle variable difficulty and (2) as the blockchains grow in size, LightClient will become slower


[10/02/2021 3:57 PM] ErgoBridge#8937
[telegram] <kushti_ru> Nipopows formal security for variable difficulty is even better these days afaik. Flyclient also requires for a new data structure to be supported. But then it is done, flyclient is simpler and takes less space in blocks.

Ergo is fairly mined, PoW - and likely more resistant to being labelled a security. Team doesn't and won't own a significant % of the tokens like most other DEXs

Rather than scaling to a global community, we designed methods for small communities to exchange, merge or separate. The interexchange module combined with multi hops provides several options for clearing external and internal payments. With a polycentric economic design paired with an interexchange module, members are able to transact with anyone while keeping the local benefits ."

Ergomixer's income (in ERG and other tokens) is currently received by its creator, aka 'anon2020s', since it has only one stakeholder at the moment.

[11/01/2021 9:54 PM] ErgoBridge#8937

[11/01/2021 9:56 PM] ErgoBridge#8937
[telegram] <Autolykos> They're committing $10 billion to it. Although watching some feedback from the gaming community it seems clear that VR is not going to be moving fast any where soon (its already been here for decades), also Meta is just copying other existing games and services which means it may not fully get what current gaming leaders are doing. But we'll see (re @ron_629: but its going to need huge money)


[11/01/2021 10:00 PM] ErgoBridge#8937
[telegram] <Autolykos> Maybe, but all the discussion keeps mentioning crypto, its uses and its decentralised structure as the ideal model. Crypto may still have a big role to play in the Metaverse space. Its like AOL waking up one day and saying, we're rebranding to "Nets" because we want to be the internet for everyone tomorrow. The growth of technology ecosystems I don't think grow the way facebook is imagining (re @ron_629: they have unlimited money to crush everyone)


[11/01/2021 10:01 PM] ErgoBridge#8937
[telegram] <ron_629> they will either make their own blockchain or use existing ones for their metaverse


[11/01/2021 10:01 PM] ErgoBridge#8937

[telegram] <SloppySmurf> No way. Facebook is dying a slow death, hence the rebranding. Their main user demo is boomer and gen x moms.

[telegram] <glasgowm> Forwarded from vitacolumbia: Why untraceable cryptocurrencies are here to stay - COPENHAGEN BUSINESS SCHOOL
The research points out that even if regulators tried to ban these privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies, it would be extremely hard to enforce across all jurisdictions - given the decentralised nature of these projects.
They recommend regulators and criminal investigators need to begin planning for the future possibility of exchanges which could ultimately mean identity linkable transaction records may not exist.

Why untraceable cryptocurrencies are here to stay
Financial regulators have a wait and see approach to decentralized privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies, letting them mature before deciding how to regulate them. Yet they assume there will be some way for oversight in the future to track extraordinary transactions linked to organized crime, terrorism financing and money laundering.

Personally I would prefer a monero type setup where every transaction is anonymous or something like secret network where you need a viewing key to view details of the transaction.  Mixers are great, but default 'always on' privacy is better imo


[11/09/2021 7:22 PM] ErgoBridge#8937
[telegram] <Kramerica Industries> right, but that risks being deemed illegal for sales, trading, and transactions in countries with large clienteles


[11/09/2021 7:24 PM] ErgoBridge#8937
[matrix] <Luten> but tbh that might happen anyway - dash got banned from exchanges for still being a 'privacy coin' even though they removed any ability to do any privatesend from all their wallets ages ago and have emphasised they're no longer privacy focussed etc.


[11/09/2021 7:24 PM] ErgoBridge#8937
[matrix] <Luten> ergo is listed as a 'privacy coin' on coin gecko


[11/09/2021 7:24 PM] ErgoBridge#8937
[matrix] <Luten> that, and having mixing services on the roadmap could be enough for delistings if big privacy crackdown were to happen


[11/09/2021 7:26 PM] ErgoBridge#8937
[matrix] <Luten> I dont think they would increase their risk of delisting by enabling fully private transactions, plus there will always be so much traffic coming from cardano and other ecosystems in future when more regulations come in that it wont matter what centralised exchanges do, they're on their way out anyway

Big Tech is Targeting You
Big Tech is collecting information on your every thought. Google has created belief maps that can actually pinpoint exact locations of people with particular viewpoints. And if you happen to fall into a classification that they consider a danger to society, you will be targeted.

Gensler refused to comment on whether Ethereum is a kind of security.
SEC has ruled that XRP is a security in a case against Ripple Labs.
Refused to comment on Etherium (after SEC classed it as a commodity previously i believe) and reiterates XRP is a security. (re @glasgowm: https://thenewscrypto.com/sec-chairman-gary-gensler-shed-light-on-crypto-regulation-for-2022/)

Monero also has avenues for exposure, the early wallets, CEX wallets KYC withdrawls etc. I'm sure there is some mapping software for monero transactions. None the less I agree with you that financial privacy is essential for freedom.
Just that monero is not the pinnacle of privacy in crypto.

It's a tradeoff between transparency and privacy. Ergo is private because with the mixer nobody knows which addresses belong to you. However it is transparent so we know how much an individual address holds.

Stealth Address Contract
Another solution for improving privacy is using stealth addresses. A stealth address preserves recipient privacy without per-transaction interaction needed (so receiver published an address e.g. on its website, and then sender can obtain some unique one-time address from it). This could be useful for privacy-preserving commerce, private donation...

> Fungibility is not a binary property of money; certain goods can be more or less fungible than others. As a borderless, apolitical money, Bitcoin has achieved significant fungibility, and usually trades at roughly the same price across the globe. However, government interference, criminal activity, and technological differences have occasionally led to certain bitcoin being more or less valuable than others.

I find value focusing on weather or not something is effective in it's uses. If monero keeps users information private, that is good. Same for Ergo. I think in both cases users will sooner be exposed through other means like IP addresses, meta data etc. 
All i see working in that area is Nym.. I'm not up to date on that project though.

[01/30/2022 1:27 PM] glasgowm#9381
It just 'hops' it through several normal looking addresses so you can't tell someones used the mixer by looking at their wallet


[01/30/2022 8:00 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I see. Could the tokens themselves be identified as having gone through the mixer? (re @ErgoBridgeBot: <Glasgow> It just 'hops' it through several normal looking addresses so you can't tell someones used...)


[01/31/2022 9:25 AM] glasgowm#0000
Yeah ofc what else could they be identified as? (re @TIMRŒ£G7: I see. Could the tokens themselves be identified as having gone through the mixer?)

non binary (re @glasgowm: Yeah ofc what else could they be identified as?)


[01/31/2022 10:02 AM] glasgowm#0000
lol. It obfuscates it from someone checking manually but since ergo is not private by default but unless you managed to pass it through mining rewards or launder it through an exchange - would go back to the mixer if you went enough ‚Äòhops‚Äô back


[01/31/2022 10:08 AM] Seedubya#0000

If addresses are randomly generated through multiple hops (and not reused), how is utilising the mixer traceable?


[01/31/2022 10:44 AM] glasgowm#0000
because if you wrote a script to check back x hops it‚Äôd take you back to mixed ergs


[01/31/2022 10:59 AM] Seedubya#0000
also have not looking deeper into stealth/covert addresses, withdrawing into these could potentially help?


[01/31/2022 11:14 AM] glasgowm#0000
withdrawing to a covert address would just mix it again. Not sure exactly how stealth addresses differ as the description looks the same


[01/31/2022 11:14 AM] glasgowm#0000
But you could generate stealth addresses from any wallet rather than from within the mixer

My home is an asset class report in European Parliament is quite an important subject, and will likely be the subject of policy discussion. We are seeing housing and land increase in value and become more concentrated/ centralised into the hands of a few landlord institutions. 
My Question: how can blockchains like ergo help new home and building ownership systems to disintegrate the stronghold of institutional landlord. And create more Democratic means of living for the everyday person where it affects them most: land and housing.


[02/01/2022 6:00 PM] fruittree#0000
I see two answers,
1. Educate people and motivate individuals to invest in non monopolistic enterprises, we as individuals focus on counter big business economic choices and make it easier for non tech based users to do the same.
2. DAOs that permit small investors to compete with big business in these investment realms.

If you use the money for good. Nothing to worry I guess (re @Jimmy Bleh Bleh: But if you give up fungibility, you give up privacy, and ultimately freedom)

Don't mix between FUNGABLE IN TERMS OF VALUE vs FUNGABLE IN TERMS OF TRACEABILITY. State which of them. (re @Jimmy Bleh Bleh: only with specialized tools, that the CIA certainly have. There are people in prison because btc is not fungible)


[02/04/2022 1:18 PM] Jimmy Bleh Bleh#0000
fungible simply means one unit is indistinguishable from another. If you can distinguish two units in any way, the currency is no longer perfectly fungible.


[02/04/2022 1:30 PM] Jimmy Bleh Bleh#0000
home price will continue to increase as long as the population keeps growing. In nominal terms it grows much faster, but that's just because of fiat inflationnary policy. Houses are becoming cheaper if you pay in btc. Honestly the best way to buy a house is to save your money in non-fiat currency imo (re @louis_berlin_style: My home is an asset class report in European Parliament is quite an important subject, and will likely be the subject of policy discussion.

Crypto‚Äôs use as currency will only be possible following proper identity checks via the country‚Äôs banking system or licensed intermediaries while operations exceeding R 600,000 ($8,016) must be declared, according to the document.
Transacting outside those proposed legal parameters will be considered a criminal offense and fines are expected to be introduced for the illegal acceptance of cryptos as a means of payment.

One could also attack the network by reducing the staked stake of normal/uneducated users via FUD campaigns about staking or regulation...
Not saying that it is realistic to make a sufficient impact, but there are many things one can do to get for a short period of time more power without owning a lot stake. That's all I want to say.

no idea (re @Gstoiti: What's the difference between Christian healthcare and normal healthcare?)


[02/21/2022 11:22 PM] fruittree#0000
maybe something with the philosophical approach like how most healthcare only support allopathic philosophies.. not sure though

hmm, thanks (re @fruittree: maybe something with the philosophical approach like how most healthcare only support allopathic philosophies.. not sure though)

Start with four camps.

1) The US is not in decline

2) The US is in decline, but it can be reversed

3) The US is in decline, and it can‚Äôt be reversed

4) The US is in decline, and it can‚Äôt be reversed, but we can blunt the impact and build a new liberal order on the other side

[02/26/2022 7:30 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I'm somewhat in camp 4. I'm ready for a more radical individualism and a move away from such powerful federal government


[02/27/2022 10:13 AM] fruittree#0000
what new system can we build? (re @TIMRŒ£G7: I'm somewhat in camp 4. I'm ready for a more radical individualism and a move away from such powerful federal government)


[02/27/2022 3:51 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Technology already enables so much independence... I think it's more of a refusal than building new systems. People have to stop giving power to central authorities. Perhaps the first step is the rise of local governments. (re @fruittree: what new system can we build?)


[02/27/2022 5:16 PM] Ile#0000
So, Ergo attracts ideologically oriented people along the lines of the manifesto. That community is committed, and contributing out of passion. Much stronger than any Solana profit chaser communities out there.
Privlidging whales is in direct contradiction to the manifesto. It is tradfi 2.0. It turns off the intrinsic willingness for people to contribute, and leaves only the money making motivations. Thereby, killing the ethos in manifesto, and replacing it with greed. This might pump price in short term, but it does not produce long term success. 
Supporting whale privlidges vocally or financially is a vote for tradfi.
Change my mind.


[02/27/2022 5:17 PM] fruittree#0000
I think so, i try to imagine what are the necessary functions or services for people and society that governments provide. 
Then make it like a free for all of services like cryptocurrency ecosystem. Like LETS.
Hopefully there is more awareness of scams etc by comparison. If not then I think people need to turn back to local community as much as possible for some time.


[02/27/2022 5:26 PM] fruittree#0000
I don't want to change your mind.. What I want is yo understand how that combines with ergo roadmap/ mission statement and competing with the ecosystem to remain relevant.. Like does ergo have an endgame or just run like a perpetual business.. 
Idk if I want to hear a direct answer as much as I want to hear various opinions/options going forward. (re @Ile: So, Ergo attracts ideologically oriented people along the lines of the manifesto.

[02/27/2022 5:27 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
The way I look at it is that ergo is just building the tools for people, it can't decide what way people choose to use them, I would like to think that people who have invested in starting a project on ergo at this early point care about first principles and from what I've seen they all do. There is no real way to control whales in Blockchain or any form of investment unfortunately, they will always have a larger control of the ecosystem next to a small holder


[02/27/2022 5:30 PM] Ile#0000
Yeah, it is up to the dapps how they use the tech.
However, they can ride the Ergo ethos in marketing, but then do something else in practice. Just like Solana is riding crypto and decentralization hype, even though its a complete lie. (Ergo projects do this to a much smaller degree, so I dont want to be too harsh.) (re @Gazza_ERG: The way I look at it is that ergo is just building the tools for people, it can't decide what way people choose to use them, I would like to think that people who have invested in starting a project on ergo at this early point care about first principles and from what I've seen they all do.

[02/27/2022 5:32 PM] Ile#0000
In my view, keeping up the culture vocally and through our actions is the only way to promote Ergo values. 
With Gazza's view, that is not part of the package. Its just tech, no values attached. (Except in the core)
In that case, I don't see what is the point of outlining any values in a manifesto at all.
Is that the way to go, or trying to affect change in the culture?


[02/27/2022 5:39 PM] fruittree#0000
I kind of always think the solution is alternative forms of governance latley, but to me it seems like the in depth answer to Ile is what Tim and I were discussing. Governance basically..


[02/27/2022 5:41 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I think that creating tools that operate fairly at a basic level is the only sustainable effort. EF cannot and should not audit every project's tokenomics to see if they agree with it or not. I think the community can and should respond to scams and questionable tokenomics, but as soon as EF starts acting like police it spoils the meaning of the manifesto. I was going to end this by saying some version of what snowman just wrote... We could have some community dao to speak on the reputation of different projects, but not police them and definitely not EF.


[02/27/2022 5:47 PM] Ile#0000
I am not suggesting EF to do anything. I am talking about the community being vigilant. (re @TIMRŒ£G7: I think that creating tools that operate fairly at a basic level is the only sustainable effort.

[02/27/2022 5:51 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Yep. Create a dao that issues something like a credit score. I think it would be fair so long as it was transparent and community funded (i.e. not for profit). Perhaps have some sort of rubric that would objectively evaluate projects and give like a trust score or something like that (re @Ile: I am not suggesting EF to do anything. I am talking about the community being vigilant.)


[02/27/2022 5:53 PM] fruittree#0000
I think for profit DAOs are fine if they have a clear end point, and follow what they claim to do. And have some plan for the remaining assets besides paying the team.. Unless that's a fair pay etc. But paying dao token holders or donating it to EF etc would be better.


[02/27/2022 6:09 PM] Gazza_ERG#0000
Definitely agree with this, it is up to us really to question things that seem wrong (re @Ile: I am not suggesting EF to do anything. I am talking about the community being vigilant.)


[02/27/2022 6:14 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I don't have a problem with for profit daos in general. I would just be cautious of the people responsible for evaluating projects having the wrong kind of incentives (re @fruittree: I think for profit DAOs are fine if they have a clear end point, and follow what they claim to do. And have some plan for the remaining assets besides paying the team.. Unless that's a fair pay etc. But paying dao token holders or donating it to EF etc would be better.)

I think it would need to be a small monetary stipend given to a range of community actors. Then they have to get 90%+ agreement on things before they publish. Perhaps it starts as a small group of trusted individuals, then expands to include delegates from projects that have already been evaluated


[02/27/2022 6:20 PM] fruittree#0000

spreading this amongst eUTXO Alliance would be nice, or having a sharing event of different ideas.

[02/27/2022 6:24 PM] Ile#0000
I was just thinking in terms of personal influence. Whether we want or not, we are continuously influencing people around us.
Accepting whale privlidges is silently supporting it, and cucking yourself in the process. I try to shift myself more into not supporting things I dont like.
Dont get me wrong, I take part in tradfi and crypto defi like any other degen out there. However, Ergo inspires me to do things right. So, I think I will try to keep my actions according to my values in Ergo. Then bring more and more of my life into that Ergo sphere. (re @TIMRŒ£G7: Yep.

[02/27/2022 6:29 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I agree that people should generally speak up and shun the shady projects, but it get's tricky when they flirt with lines that haven't been defined clearly. That's why I say create a dao and use a ojective rubric. It puts everyone on the same playing field and let's average consumers compare the various projects they might invest in (re @Ile: I was just thinking in terms of personal influence.

[02/27/2022 6:50 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
but you're right. idk that it would be neccessary


[02/27/2022 6:50 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
I just generally try to pay people for their time


[02/27/2022 6:54 PM] Ile#0000
Objective rubric is quite hard.
If an anon team produces open source code, then all good. If a doxxed team does not produce OS code before selling, then what is the criteria? You need to evaluate background of the team for example. Objectivity becomes hard.
If we only measure objective things, like OS/not or anon/doxxed, then we have to discourage legit non-OS teams. 
Can be done, but there is a lot of weeds on the way of creating and maintaining that scoring for sure. Especially, if teams start adapting to it. (re @TIMRŒ£G7: I agree that people should generally speak up and shun the shady projects, but it get's tricky when they flirt with lines that haven't been defined clearly.

[02/27/2022 6:56 PM] Ile#0000
Yeah, it is fair. Not necessarily against it. Maybe just donations.
No pay would simplify some stuff, but not sure if that is feasible if there is a lot of work. (re @TIMRŒ£G7: I just generally try to pay people for their time)


[02/27/2022 6:57 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Well i make rubrics for a living haha. They're not perfectly objective most of the time, but it's much better than just having an opinion about something. I think things like open source and doxxing would be a box to check, contributing to an overall score.


[02/27/2022 6:58 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
Other items could be tokenomics, fair launch, code audit

[02/27/2022 6:59 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000

what are the necessary components to a parallel economy or free market? I get the suspicion that anything which is not based on in person trade or production is just a parasitic aspect of economies. (yes most of crypto trading, governance etc.)


[03/06/2022 8:01 AM] Ile#0000
I agree. True decentralization, resilience and freedom from outside pressure needs to be tied with personal trust. That is lets. 
However, I think we will need a global system in parallel. At least in the transition phase. (re @fruittree: what are the necessary components to a parallel economy or free market?

If they can't win via market forces but are useful to some, there is at least an option.

For that, I was thinking more about the on chain identities.
I think they need to be on-chain only. Encourage no doxxing. My idea would be as follows:
1. Make new address. Get ERG from faucet. Announce it as on chain id by interacting with a platform owner address. You receive 1 erg and 1 000 000 tokens in return. 
2. Every month, there is an event to prove that you are a unique person. The platform owner address mints an NFT, that includes a link to a website. On that website there is a game that takes 10 min activity to complete. At the end, you get instructions to send X tokens to platform address. X is for example the three first numbers in your own address. Txs sent after 15 min do not count as successful. This ensures that one person can only complete the game with one address. The instructions, player actions, and result are verifiable on chain (publish X logic as NFT after game).
3. Now we have a list of unique people in Ergo community. Invite projects to use them for governance (or airdrops). Projects can issue contributor NFTs for those who take part. 
4. Over time, projects have a good idea who they want to include in community led governance. Gov tokens cant achieve this. 
5. Make sure all is OS. Including front end. Anyone can copy it and announce new platform address, in case old becomes inactive. 
I would be up for working on this. ID allows for better gov models. On chain with privacy is missing currently. Could apply for dark or good whale fund to hire dev.

the game or certified games would need to be easily accessible for most devices or browsers..
If someone was to game the system.. I wonder what would stop/encourage them. I think someone would try to make a lot of accounts and sell them..  but that happens with national IDs even more easily because they are somewhat permanent.. where this is like bi annually activated.


[03/06/2022 12:26 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Very interesting. Could you explain the motivation behind each step? For example, why do you want to send a nft with a link? Why don't you just announce the link on the website of the platform? One could get the link in the nft from the explorer anyways. And why does one need those tokens? Wouldn't it suffice to let people play the game within 15 minutes (so that one person can only play it once) and then show them an address and a very very small amount of Erg (either address or amount unique, like nft drops do it) and the address which sends the amount to this address is verified for the next period.

With my question I think i was wanting more broad/specific points... Like.
digital banking
communications
Governance  or mediation
Marketplaces
???
Agorism/free markets/counter/parallel economies anarchy etc all seem to need to achieve these foundations for societal change, but so few get to the point  of having tangible options/tools.
I think outlining the main functions needed or capable of being effectively run in a counter economic approach and then building it will have a good impact on people.


[03/06/2022 12:35 PM] Ile#0000
Yes. The game can be very simple. Minimize failure due to devices. There is just one shot at it per month.
To stop selling accounts, bribing and coercion, we could encourage partner projects to exclude all addresses that are sold/doxxed. 
We cant verify this on chain, but we can encourage community to stay vigilant. (re @fruittree: the game or certified games would need to be easily accessible for most devices or browsers..

The tokens are used to communicate the right answer, which is different for every participant. So X can be for example 123 for you, and 456 for me. Then you send that amount to platform address. (re @Gstoiti: Very interesting. Could you explain the motivation behind each step? For example, why do you want to send a nft with a link?

NFT because announcing on website is not verifiable on chain. We can of course simultaneously add it on the webpage (re @Gstoiti: Very interesting. Could you explain the motivation behind each step?

[03/06/2022 12:41 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Yeah, sure, but that could also be done with Erg. One person sends 0.000456 and a second person 0.000342.

[03/06/2022 12:42 PM] Ile#0000
If the small amount of erg is only communicated on the game, then the history is not verifiable. 
It could just be erg instead of token for sure (re @Gstoiti: Very interesting. Could you explain the motivation behind each step? For example, why do you want to send a nft with a link?

[03/06/2022 12:43 PM] Ile#0000
Yes. Right. Wanted to save ergs, but the token is unnecessary as long as the addresses get some erg from faucet (re @Gstoiti: Yeah, sure, but that could also be done with Erg. One person sends 0.000456 and a second person 0.000342.)


[03/06/2022 12:44 PM] Ile#0000
One nft to announce the game website. Second nft 15 min later to leave a record what logic was used to create the game results. (re @Gstoiti: Ok, makes sense. But then one nft would suffice, because everyone could check this nft in the explorer.)


[03/06/2022 12:45 PM] Ile#0000

Game design/choice is also an interesting topic, because it should be easy, so that everyone who tries can solve it, but on the other hand it should be complicated enough, so that one person can't play two or more games at the same time. And obviously the duration of the game must be approximately fixed.


[03/06/2022 1:09 PM] Ile#0000
Yes, easy but needing full attention. Can be different game every time.
I though a quiz could be a good start. Give text that includes an answer. 30 sec to read, 20 sec to answer 10 sec wait for next question. Ten questions, and anyone with 5 right answers  gets the information on the amount to send for passing the test.
Later, as we learn and there comes more malicious attempts, the game needs to get smarter.

Thinking a bit out there, one potential use case could be a decentralized way for generating NFTs that represent an identity for 1st/2nd layer protocols that inherently provide sybil attack resistance natively.

It‚Äôs like a free-for-all global USENET hierarchy that anyone can curate or contribute to, complete with decentralised ACLs. Or like DMOZ but for chatrooms. We haven‚Äôt published a ‚Äúroot‚Äù space as Matrix.org yet (as the ‚Äúsubspace‚Äù hierarchy feature is still in beta), but I cannot wait to kill off the public room directory for Matrix.org (which is a total tirefire atm) and replace it with decentralised hierarchies of rooms that the community can moderate and curate like any other content.

I mean I don't think the difficulty is high enough, far from it. You make it sound like we have too many miners. But according to crypto51.app, it only cost $5k to 51% attack ergo for 1 hour. Even if this estimate is off by a factor of 100x, it is still very low. We need more hashrate and more profit at the same time, hence my question.

I'm not saying we have too many miners that's not really possible, I'm saying we have to let the marketing move the price up before we can attract more miners, miners usually only look at profit, and the best way to increase Blockchain profitability is technology and marketing. Both are being worked on.

The NiceHashable amount is only 8% so it‚Äôs not feasible no matter the amount without buying a farm worth of rigs - even then there isn‚Äôt much incentive as exchanges would shut it down, etc. 
Profitability will vary over time - smaller miners will leave and bigger miners with lower costs will join and hold


[03/10/2022 5:07 PM] glasgowm#0000
> Mining pools offer a buffer against such network attacks as the hash rate is distributed across thousands of individual miners.
The memory hardened aspect of ergo also makes this vector of attack more expensive as there is no ASIC support to rent. With the collective rentable rigs at the moment this isnt a viable path to a 51% attack. In theory, someone could build a massive GPU farm to try to launch such an attack. If a bad actor can rent a warehouse of ASIC and mine on a small chain with 51% attacks are a viable option... if there is an offramp.
Usually, this attack is done for profit and there is massive dumping that occurs on an exchange as it is occuring. Meaning the attacker is going to dump tokens on an exchange then "double-spend" them back into their wallet. The current exchange situation doesn't provide the liquidity for a viable offramp. The rentable ASIC support isn't an option. So is it possible, in theory, yes, practical or likely I dont think so at all.
Ethereum classic is perhaps a bad example, as it shares the same mining algorithm as Eth. One could buy more than 100% existing hashrate of eth classic on NiceHash. It's not the same case for Ergo. Ergo also believes in the 'Good Miner' principle, In the case of Bitcoin - it was a good thing 51% existed.

nano gains more support as the price goes down / retail leaves market. As they re-enter the pools move to being more decentralised again. No quick solution for this just a lot of old rigs running nano passively


[03/10/2022 5:10 PM] Jimmy Bleh Bleh#0000
Yeah I agree it would not be a for profit attack, I am more afraid of some project looking to destroy the ergo project by giving it a bad reputation. For many people, suffered a 51 attack = shitcoin, even if there are no real consequences (re @glasgowm: > Mining pools offer a buffer against such network attacks as the hash rate is distributed across thousands of individual miners.

this also dictates that lowering price isn‚Äôt really an attack vector here either

i think his point/concern is more that of anti censorship and not pro-privacy in this specific instance

and real people spread misinfo either intentially with malace/ as an alt motive or not. whats believed or seemingly objectively best for somone/something or just on paper and by numbers/statistics,etc could likely not align with how majority of humanity want or are willing to live (re @glasgowm: yeh I doubt those ones will be spreading misinfo tho)

We‚Äôve been engineering spam and algorithms to convince people to do that for decades. People have always chatted shite but now theres industries pumping out nonsense and flooding search results with their pish.

no censorship is fine when both parties are on equal ground (human). People stand 0 chance against bots and algos

The problem with self-hosted search engine is that they make you very unique: you‚Äôre the only client of the engine with that (static and non-NATed) IP. You‚Äôre also now one of the small group of people with hosting IPs. 
Using an instance hosted by someone else is marginally better, if you trust the owner of the server, which is probably not what you want for privacy-centered search engine.

(re @Jimmy Bleh Bleh : *I was thinking about a WTI (oil futures) backed token but I don't see how people could mint it*) 
 
 at least this way we don't need to manage actual barrels of oil but how to prove ownership without a trusted party ?

 Commodity pegged, erg backed (or maybe anetaBTC) is possible in a decentralized way.


[05/21/2022 3:35 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
Real backing with gold in a decentralized way could be people holding gold, and promising to redeem at a price that they post daily. That would work as an oracle too. 
Get slashed from profits, if deny service. This would just run into a problem with local laws in many places. The gold backer list would have to be public.
Something like that could be a decentralized version of paxg.


[05/21/2022 3:37 PM] KalloShaman#0000
Maybe we should leave idea of physical gold to the past. Thats why we have limited supply of coin (erg, btc...) This could be new digital gold.

(re @KalloShaman : *Maybe we should leave idea of physical gold to the past. Thats why we have limited supply of coin (erg, btc...) This could be new digital gold.*) 
 
 I dont think gold is going anywhere. Btc and erg wont have the same level of store of value credibility anytime soon.
Erg is not even aiming for that


[05/21/2022 3:44 PM] KalloShaman#0000
I am not saying that gold will lose value, i am saying that physical thing can hardly be part of decentralized economy. Someone has to hold physical property amd you have to somehow force them to keep the deal. Law is one way to do it, but thats always centralised


[05/21/2022 3:47 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
But I somehwhat agree. Using btc as the stablecoin would bypass most of the need for stablecoins. Some demand will be there as a financial instrument.

(re @Ile : *But I somehwhat agree. Using btc as the stablecoin would bypass most of the need for stablecoins. Some demand will be there as a financial instrument.*) 
 
 Some sort of community credit, asset backed or hawala type system seems like a good idea on top of a lets. Bootstrapping trust is difficult.


[05/21/2022 3:51 PM] KalloShaman#0000
I believe that as production will be more and more automated we will see that physical part of goods will be smaller part of value. I see it already for example in clothes. If you buy expensive clothes you dont pay for something physical, you pay fpr brand which is "virtual" value

 But even for slashing how would that work ? The protocol sends a commando taking the gold in the vaults ?

(re @Jimmy Bleh Bleh : *But even for slashing how would that work ? The protocol sends a commando taking the gold in the vaults ?*) 
 
 Yeah.. Not very thought through. 
Could be profits going to a vested contract on-chain. If I promise to sell 1oz at some price, and then dont, then take those vestings away.
But how to control fake reports of no-sale?

 Synthetic assets using collateralized debt pisitions are one approach. But in my opinion they are more a tool for trading commodities than for holding them.

 Check out hackathon project Ergo Nation. It is doing decentralized pseudonymous IDs. Holders of those IDs are encouraged to act in defense of anonymity and decentralization. Projects that care about those ideals can draw on the community for governance, and other engagements. 

If it works, then the incentives will be radically re-aligned. The community only has value, if it acts according to the ideals. The projects have an option of utilizing that community. The line between speaking and acting for decentralization would become much more salient.

 Interesting idea. What is the advantage to direct voting? 

I guess more time to deliberate, and follow gets people to think more carefully, but it also causes more overhead. Can't have attention for hundreds of ongoing votes. 

For some recurring votes, like base fee or something, this could be an ongoing vote. Think of a dapp dashboard, where you have many ongoing votes, and your vote on them. If you change mind, you could switch the vote.

 I actually started thinking of several ways (more or less democratic, recurring or one-off, etc), and this would be just one of them.

 What do you think about the advantage of anonymity in the process? 

In the bee example, the most vigorous bee wins, while a very good hive detective with bad dancing skills would lose. That is analogous to politicians winning not based on an argument, but rhetorics and influence. Those traits can be applied for selfish/croynist monetary gain, instead of what is best for the swarm. (Also people with certain personal traits become self-selected in positions of power, which means that the people wont be well represented)

If the arguments could be made anon, then the voters could focus on the content, instead of the dance. It would also save all the overhead going into campaigning, lobbying and fundraising that politicians like to do. 

There are probably downsides to it too. I just feel like it is a promising area for experimentation. Anonymity is already a tool in the traditional elections (voting booth). Blockchain allows moving that into representative levels and trying completely new models.

 Bees must have evolved this system over many millions of years, so it must well for them; and as an analogy - it may work for us, if we will understand how to implement it in a way that fits our needs.
When a bee roots for a specific hive (or in our case - a specific answer/decision), it has no personal gain/benefit; it just tells its sisters ‚Äú I think this would be a great place for us‚Äù and that‚Äôs it. I think that this decision making process should work well in occasions where the questions/decisions to be taken relate to the greater good (of a project, a community, etc.). 
Anonymity in this situation is not critical in my mind. Could someone benefit personally from supporting a specific option? Perhaps; but this is a one bee one vote system, and every bee (of voting age) can participate. 
Having a unique, and possibly anonymous ID could help more people join in the process, while making sure no one gets to influence by more than his fair share.

 They have evolved to make this same decision. I suppose you are right, that the selection process has aligned dancing, and picking the best option.

For humans, the votes would be on varying new topics. You are right that the fit needs to be carefully thought. Maybe the human dancing, and good for all is not so well evolved to align.

 More thoughts on the bee model.

To answer my own question about advantages, I think this model discovers and presents many available options. 

Direct vote is more about yes/no on a well defined question.

So your example about naming is great. Brings in creativity into the process.

 Practical example in crypto/Ergo now. 

Ergodex, auction house, skyharbor... All have a problem of verifying no-scam tokens/collections. 

If you have a group of people with IDs  who care about the project and the ecosystem, then the on-going voting would work very well for this purpose. Also, some standards can be pre-defined.

Aren't bees a lot more dependent on their swarm and its well beeing (<- couldn't resist üòÖ) than we are in our society atm? Sure, most of us need other humans to survive, but in a way more abstract way (buying food and other goods in a store, without the requirement of social contact or caring about others) than bees need other bees, hence, they are maybe trained to care about the greater good in some sense.

 Bees - if they are cut off from the swarm, may die in a day or two, unless they find a beehive nearby, and manage to get into it bearing a load of nectar as a gift (otherwise the guards would normally not let it in). So you are right. But this does not mean we cannot establish voting protocols that learn something from the way bees do it!

 Just read it once and probably have to read it again, but it seems the main arguments that DAOs aren't corporations are that they are metalegal (because of geographic decentralization) and pseudonymous. But are they really metalegal or is there just no enforcement (and clear regulation) at the moment? Companies can also be joined by people from different countries, but the company has to decide where it resides because of regulation and enforcement. Wouldn't something similar to the EU regulation proposal and its consequences for non-custodial (including multi-sig) wallets lead to DAOs losing both properties, because one legal entity (with its real name and location) would be connected to the wallet? Would DAOs then be no DAOs anymore? Are DAOs just a concept to avoid regulation or are there also organizational/structural differences (which are independent of regulation) to companies?


[06/03/2022 12:23 AM] Gstoiti#0000
Tbh I am not happy with defining DAOs to be metalegal. That can change within a year. If being metalegal is a defining property, then DAOs are probably only a meme and they will vanish when regulation catches up.


[06/03/2022 12:24 AM] Gstoiti#0000
Although the author of the thread wants to convince me that DAOs are fundamentally different, he reached the opposite.

What are your thoughts?


[06/03/2022 12:28 AM] Gstoiti#0000
Also what's the difference between multi-sig wallets and multi-sig bank accounts from an organizational perspective? Only regulation and regulation will catch up.


[06/03/2022 1:00 AM] louis_berlin_style#0000
My perspective is DAOs are rooted in ownership logic, and therefore implicitly are a legal notion. 

In many cases, the token represents the a bundle of rights that a share in a software company would otherwise have. 

Because the law is programmed into a tamper proof smart contract, it reduces many areas a lawyer might have been needed. For example: arbitrated contractual agreements. This reduces the requirement for complex beuracracy to uphold it.

However, I would argue that blockchains are not metalegal, rather they are a form of automated legal instrument. 

There is a famous philosophical paradox: when claim they are beyond an ideology are often actually at the very heart of that ideology because their position is fully informed by an understanding of those parameters. And because their response is wholly informed by a particular ideology, this ultimately means their critical response results as a peice of progress the ideology.

 Yeah, that resembles my views to some extent. However, do DAOs necessarily need to own something? E.g. a DAO could only make recommendations about concepts like the Ergo Nation DAO plans to do. Also there are DAOs without token.

[06/03/2022 1:12 AM] louis_berlin_style#0000
There is the ‚Äòbundle of rights‚Äô analogy that explains ownership a lot like a bundle of sticks tied together.  But you can untie them and give particular rights to different people.

For example, a home owner can give rights of use to the tenant. But keep the other ‚Äòsticks‚Äô for themselves. Like ability to ask for rent. Or apply for planning permission.

In a same way the token represents a right, or a particular set of rights in relation to something.

In this sense it is always a notion of ownership accompanying a token. Even if they are just an ability to express some power over having any value as wealth. 

 Does a bundle of sticks stop being a bundle of sticks If there are less sticks in the bundle? or if the sticks are different to another much larger bundle with lots of different sticks?No because there are still some sticks there.

Bundle of rights
The bundle of rights is a metaphor to explain the complexities of property ownership.  Law school professors of introductory property law courses frequently use this conceptualization to describe "full" property ownership as a partition of various entitlements of different stakeholders.The bundle of rights is commonly taught in US first-year law...

There is definitely a governance power structure in the group. 

For example I don‚Äôt have the right to remove people, whereas an admin does. I would argue that indicates some ownership capacity, like the admin has one stick I don‚Äôt have.


[06/03/2022 1:21 AM] Gstoiti#0000
Yeah, but imagine nobody could ban or remove people.

Btw it would be nice if someone from Paideia would join the discussion.


[06/03/2022 1:26 AM] louis_berlin_style#0000
In engaging in the group I enter into a social contract. 

In many cases a social contract is I mplied but not explicit.

 There‚Äôs are two layers of law. The harder law and softer law. So more the law of the land, and a more mailable and plastic social layer. 

For example I enter into a cafe that is owned by a person. In the street I have just come from the law of the land states that theft is illegal. However, this cafe owner says things inside are all free. So the social contract changes because the owner has announced to me how he is allowing people to interact with the things within the space that are distinctly different from the outside.


[06/03/2022 1:31 AM] louis_berlin_style#0000
In the same way, there are social normative behaviours that are moulded by the ownership logic in the ergo agora.

Eg: somebody decided the key principals of this particular internet social space because they had ownership power to inform the rules for us. And therefore provide the boundaries of our social interaction.

(re @Gstoiti : *Tbh I am not happy with defining DAOs to be metalegal. That can change within a year. If being metalegal is a defining property, then DAOs are probably only a meme and they will vanish when regulation catches up.*) 
 
 Legal touches on the decentralized and autonomous part of the DAO.

If a DAO chooses to be regulated, then it will have less of both. Arguably its almost centralized, because law makers/enforcement can change it anyway they like.

If anonymity can be protected, then it enables people from everywhere to participate. That can enable a more ethical organization of people from around the world. Two countries might have strictly opposing laws, which would make a law abiding ethical choice impossible. 

I guess you can call legal DAO a DAO too, because the terms are so flexible. However, I think I agree with you on that it is nothing new if they are legal.

So how about metalegal that is devoted to staying that way? Is your that they cant stay metalegal?

(re @Gstoiti : *Another question: do DAOs necessarily need blockchain technology? Or is it only one way of realizing a DAO? Btw I think the Ergo Nation DAO doesn't need blockchain tech, although Ergo Nation needs/uses it.*) 
 
 I think DAO can exist without blockchain. Ergo Nation is already showing first signs of people contributing and organizing toward some vague ideals without being asked to. And nothing happened on chain yet. 

The chain part is going to be a database of the EN history. That strenghtens the decentralization. Anyone can look up the ID records later. No reliance on people to maintain the data. Not fully necessary, but improvement I think.

 I guess my point is that they will move from metalegal to either legal or illegal when regulation catches up (at least those which deal with large funds and wallets).

 In theory, simplifying the laws and automating them via smart contracts sounds cool, but I don't know how we could "impact the real world" with it. There seems to always have the need for stupid loopholes like this one to get actual work done (here protect the bees).

 A DAO is a global entity that supercedes specific countries' laws, except in situations where the DAO is operating within a country's borders. So there's no international tax law, but any member with a majority stake may cause a DAO to be considered a legal entity in their country. Or, if more than one member is from a single country and a government can prove that the majority of a DAO is owned by citizens of their country, they may be able to impose securities laws and things like that.

 Thanks for your comment. Is that your opinion? Or that of someone else (institution, expert,...)? 

Btw what is a DAO in your opinion? How would you define it? What are necessary and sufficient conditions to be a DAO? Probably that should be discussed first. W

Since you probably thought a lot about DAOs, how would you define a DAO (not necessarily from a legal perspective)? The twitter thread posted by Ile above basically reduces a DAO to a multisig wallet. In my opinion a DAO doesn't need to own funds or a wallet. What's your opinion?


[06/04/2022 10:16 PM] Gstoiti#0000
And do you think DAOs need to be related to blockchains in some way to be a DAO?

 Decentralized Autonomous Organization, it's right there in the name. The problem is that practically any organization will need funds to do whatever that organization does. It doesn't matter whether it is a church, sport club, or group of friends throwing a party, money comes into the picture.

 why do you think is executing automatically important?


[06/04/2022 11:07 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
- Ownership must be decentralized
- decisions must automatically execute after a vote in some way
- it must be a group of people organized toward a common aim

 So basically, many normal companies with many shareholders (noone owning more than 49%) are DAOs if they manage to automate execution of shareholder votings?

(re @Gstoiti : *So basically, many normal companies with many shareholders (noone owning more than 49%) are DAOs if they manage to automate execution of shareholder votings?*) 
 
 No because the vote doesn't have an automated outcome


[06/04/2022 11:12 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
You vote for the leadership team who then executes plans, with virtually no oversight, until the next vote


[06/04/2022 11:12 PM] marty_ergopad#0000

I misread "no one owning more than 49%"


[06/04/2022 11:13 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Yeah I mean if it's 3 people with 33% control and their decisions are voted on, then executed automatically in some way with some code, then you have a DAO


[06/04/2022 11:14 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Sorry, I know I am annoying, but I just want to get a feeling for what a DAO is.


[06/04/2022 11:14 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
And if all 3 people live in different countries, that DAO is a global entity that doesn't have to register itself as a corporation under any one jurisdiction.


[06/04/2022 11:14 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
If you want to operate in the USA, you have to follow US laws, for example


[06/04/2022 11:15 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
But you don't have to register a corporation there or pay corporate income tax


[06/04/2022 11:15 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
If you're a US citizen and a beneficiary of the DAOs profits then you better tell the IRS, and the SEC may take interest. But I'm not a lawyer or a US citizen, so it's just an example of some potential pitfalls

(re @Gstoiti : *Yeah, but what are necessary and sufficient conditions to call something

 This is mostly a semantic argument. Depending on your criteria, you could include or exclude anything based on definition, no true scotsman style. For example, is anything really autonomous, able to make decisions without consideration of a legal jurisdiction, such as international law? If voting is only equitable and not equal, does that count as "decentralized"? Is my three friends and I an "organization"?


[06/04/2022 11:16 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Many "DAOs" have votings, but no automatic execution. Instead a leadershop team, e.g. devs implement votings.


[06/04/2022 11:16 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
Well, with Paideia we'll build the tools to automate execution


[06/04/2022 11:17 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
It would be like "budget $10k of ergo from our treasury for marketing and hire 3 YouTube influencers. Person A will receive the funds and follow through"


[06/04/2022 11:17 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
The smart contract would tally the votes and send the funds to person A who would then be responsible for spending them


[06/04/2022 11:18 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
You could have one youtube influencer as the recipient of funds for a proposal, which would cut out the middle man..somebody still has to talk to them though and organize it

[06/04/2022 11:18 PM] marty_ergopad#0000

[06/04/2022 11:18 PM] marty_ergopad#0000
In Paideia we allow for remittances I think it's called..like you can come back and add a receipt or some evidence of execution


[06/04/2022 11:19 PM] marty_ergopad#0000

[06/04/2022 11:22 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @Gstoiti : *Which terms?*) 
 
 The first task of an argument is to outline your definitions. Then, your premises based on those definitions. Then, a logical argument, where true premises are in a valid logical format. That's if we want to argue using deductive reasoning. If we want inductive, then you could provide examples of DAOs and then we could try to tease out what makes those examples DAOS and build the argument backward.


[06/04/2022 11:23 PM] cafebedouin#0000
So, either definitions or examples. Then we can have a conversation.


[06/04/2022 11:33 PM] Gstoiti#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *So, either definitions or examples. Then we can have a conversation.*) 
 
 I think you missunderstand my intention.

I am looking for a definition of the term DAO. I am doing that by proposing definitions (at the moment that's Marty's part) and then discussing examples that fit or don't fit that definition (e.g. companies with votes on department budgets). If an example fits the definition, but we agree that it shouldn't be called a DAO, then we must change the definition. If we find an example that we want to call DAO, but that doesn't satisfy our definition, we also should change the definition.

Honestly, I don't see any problem with this method and philosophers are doing that for 1000s of years.

Above I was just asking for a more precise definition (conditions to call something decentralized, autonomous, organization) so that we can start to evaluate whether examples fit or don't fit the definition.


[06/04/2022 11:36 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Basically, I want to use contradictions to characterize DAOs.


[06/04/2022 11:37 PM] fruittree#0000
Decentralization or decentralisation is the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision making, are distributed or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group. 

autonomous
1a: having the right or power of self-government
an autonomous territory
b: undertaken or carried on without outside control : SELF-CONTAINED
an autonomous school system

An organization, or organisation (Commonwealth English; see spelling differences), is an entity‚Äîsuch as a company, an institution, or an association‚Äîcomprising one or more people and having a particular purpose

would be good to clarify what can be done by code and what needs people to organize it.

(re @fruittree : *would be good to clarify what can be done by code and what needs people to organize it.*) 
 
 True, also in combination with "decentralized", because many people would argue that many large companies where department heads can spend budgets how they want and make decisions without asking the board (compared to the company board as a central authority making all decisions) are as decentralized regarding decision making as most DAOs atm.


[06/04/2022 11:46 PM] fruittree#0000
like the quotes above i guess I'd say a DAO is a group of people with a like minded goal/ purpose, that agree to operate in a fair non hierarchal  manner. 

They could be criminals, kids in a playground, business men etc. I'd say they all employ similar approaches as a DAO.. In theory..

I see more value in exploring what can be done for us like with paideia and what still needs to be done individually etc. where does the real energy come from..

Money, community, products, services, assets..?

 What I really want to know is whether "DAO" is just a blockchain buzzword without a lot behind it or whether they are really a "new" concept which is really different from traditional organizations and structures.


[06/04/2022 11:51 PM] Gstoiti#0000
But there seems to be no real consensus what a DAO is.


[06/04/2022 11:51 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Other than more vague words.


[06/04/2022 11:52 PM] fruittree#0000
it's is another step towards automating business/community governance as i see it.

potentially combining a handful of services into 1 which is provable, secure, etc etc.


[06/04/2022 11:53 PM] fruittree#0000
defining one word the same way between a few people is very hard. a new word like a DAO is harder.

I wouldn't waste time trying to create a echo chamber.

zoom out and see what needs and services are fullfilled, what is still needed. why people are too lazy to fullfill them if code/blockchain helps or complicates it more.. beware of losing security via over reliance on blockchain.. some real world meetings for DAOs etc would help that.

[06/05/2022 12:02 AM] Gstoiti#0000
I completely agree. We should focus on usecases and tools and not on differentiation to the traditional/non-crypto world. But with words like "DAO" we are doing that. 

As you said many NPOs, foundations, for profit companies and other organizations could use tools provided by Paideia.

marketing isn't easy and to just say open source coded websites using triple entry bookkeeping software run on somewhat decentralized servers may not be as effective as.. "DAPPs on a decentralized blockchain"

I'd like for it to be reduced down to no ego wording to help me zoom out and see what is the real use case.

 Sure, I can understand that from a marketing perspective and that's totally okay for me. I just want to know whether there are only marketing reasons to use new words or whether it really is something different or new.

Can't be both, because I said "ONLY marketing reasons" or "...". So, the second case would include marketing + something new üòÖ


[06/05/2022 12:20 AM] fruittree#0000
I see both, there are some genuinely new aspects and some words used just for marketing or more so written for the crypto investor audience. 

what is new for crypto moving forward  is mostly how much people use it and give significance to it.

It used to be impressive to use it as a decentralized bank.. now nobody cares..

then it was cool to have high TPS. now nobody cares.. i hope.

Something new vs a new name imo isn't the biggest aspect, i think it is more so what we do with what we have and how accurate we aim at what is needed.

Some aspects of the DeFi will become more well built and user friendly but nothing stops us from being radical and living fully in an alternative society, fully embracing the governance and banking tools.. besides the possible violent police paid by trust worthy local and global governments...

so the water slowly boils..

(re @Gstoiti : *I think you missunderstand my intention.

I am looking for a definition of the term DAO. I am doing that by proposing definitions (at the moment that's Marty's part) and then discussing examples that fit or don't fit that definition (e.g. companies with votes on department budgets). If an example fits the definition, but we agree that it shouldn't be called a DAO, then we must change the definition. If we find an example that we want to call DAO, but that doesn't satisfy our definition, we also ...*) 
 
 Maybe I haven't looked back in this conversation far enough. But, I see neither definitions or examples. Perhaps you can point to them?

For my part, I think anyone that wants to call themselves a DAO is a DAO, until we have enough examples to start eliminating types. If I were to try for definitions, I'd say decentralized implies people that do not necessarily know one another. Autonomous is being able to act independently of some other organization. Organization implies more than one person.

If we accept those three definitions as a starting point, then they imply some purpose. Organization implies some kind of software above the Dunbar number of 150. Software implies some way to make decisions and coordinate activity among disparate, unknown-to-each other actors. 

Based on those definitions, is old-school moot era 4chan a DAO? Then, you start fleshing your definitions out, or find other examples. That would be a useful conversation. 

Right now, there's a lot of abstractions. Abstractions can be useful, but right now, in this conversation, I don't think they are.

[06/05/2022 1:00 AM] cafebedouin#0000
A Quaker Meeting is its own thing and it sends a representative to a larger group to which they affiliate, such as the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting.


[06/05/2022 1:01 AM] cafebedouin#0000
So, it would work, just as a committee within a Meeting is not a new meeting. But Yearly Meetings are Meetings, just larger.


[06/05/2022 1:38 AM] Gstoiti#0000
Hmm, I guess that depends on how one looks at it and how one defines sub-unit (e.g. subset, element, something more complicated) and being the same thing (e.g. same structure, same level in hierarchy, same type of elements, ...). For me it doesn't matter what quakers officially call "quaker meeting" or "committee".

But I just realized I am probably thinking in a completely different way than you about what a unit and a sub-unit is.

But I can see your point now (although I view things differently and would not agree from my original perspective).

A DAO can be anything you want


[06/05/2022 5:35 AM] odiseus_me#0000
I would like to advance a different perspective; one of  possible few; and it is a perspective rather than a definition. I believe we are trying to invent and create a *virtual entity* (which we like to call a DAO, I think we can agree on that), which will provide *certain* *benefits* to its *participants* (one or more legal persons, I think that could also be agreed; ai, in the future, may or may not count as participant).
We can agree and disagree on what one or another attribute of the DAO, but I propose that we discuss *what it is not*. I think that understanding and agreeing on what it is not will help us understand what we need to to be. So, as one [1] example - we do not want it to reside in a legal territory, under any jurisdiction. [2] we do not want anyone living in a jurisdiction that, because he owns or can influence part of the DAO (how big would that be?) would make the DAO subject to said jurisdiction. 
Anyone cares to continue?

(re @marty_ergopad : *A DAO can be anything you want. It's just a decentralized organization where people agree on actions and then they're automated in some way*) 
 
 I think that this very broad definition is a good starting point for Paideia, which is developing tools that could serve many types of organizations, DAOs included. 
And perhaps when we discuss here the question of what is a DAO, we will never reach a single broad set of common definitions. 
Another way to move forward is for us to discuss what would be a useful definition. Saying a DAO could be anything you want - is less useful in my mind, in this forum, than saying it is it Decentralized, or than saying it is Autonomous, and that is an organization that exists, as an entity, on the blockchain (and therefore it has at least one multisig wallet). What other attributes could be useful?

 Although, I dont think the automated exectuion has to be the definition.

As a decentralized autonomous (in traditional meaning) organization, we could vote on-chain about our logo. Nothing gets executed, but it informs social consensus.


[06/05/2022 7:57 AM] Gstoiti#0000
I think many groups of people who understand themselves as DAO don't use automated execution atm. But I guess the majority of them plans to use it.

I still got the feeling that a lot of people associate DAOs with some sort of management of shared funds. Automating execution of fund spending votes is easy on a blockchain. If a DAO doesn't have any funds (like for example Ergo Nation), then having automated execution of votes (like logo choice or appproval votes) seems a lot harder or at least more abstract.

(re @Ile : *I mean, is that an established characteristic of a dao? If yes, then maybe autonomous is not the best word to describe it*) 
 
 I agree with this point. To me, autonomy means self governed and not influenced by people outside of the organization. Automation is a cool feature that can be applied to some processes, but not everything needs a smart contract or blockchain, and not having those things shouldn't mean that the organization is not autonomous.


[06/05/2022 5:33 PM] liquid_phase#4605
I agree with looking into the wording here - though my thoughts are that the difference between a real DAO and a layer 2 project is that a DAO could be run entirely by automated functions without people based on it's given goals of operation.

 I agree that if you want a dao to be unstoppable, the more automated functions it has, the better. You'd need a large enough organization to make your voting mechanism robust, and then a system that could actually execute whatever was voted on. The problem is that many functions require action irl. If the dao was governing action in the metavers, that is a different story, tho

(re  : *<liquid_phase> I agree with looking into the wording here - though my thoughts are that the difference between a real DAO and a layer 2 project is that a DAO could be run entirely by automated functions without people based on it's given goals of operation.*) 
 
 Based on this idea, what would be the difference between a DAO and just a smart contract?


[06/05/2022 6:15 PM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *Based on this idea, what would be the difference between a DAO and just a smart contract?*) 
 
 Perhaps that it requires member interaction to execute. So not just a multi sig wallet, but multi sig contract (or a system of them)


[06/05/2022 6:27 PM] liquid_phase#4605
I think that a DAO could be an amalgam of different types of smart contracts working together with other types of automated WEB 2.0 systems.

(re  : *<liquid_phase> I think that a DAO could be an amalgam of different types of smart contracts working together with other types of automated WEB 2.0 systems.*) 
 
 Weird. When I think of DAO, I think people. Abstracting out the people seems like something else to me. But, maybe the problem is my preconception?


[06/11/2022 4:40 PM] liquid_phase#4605
I see what you mean - and dont think that you‚Äôre wrong - just that the two aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive - that a DAO could be run by people but also not and still be completely the same

 Suppose it were possible to upload your consciousness into a computer of some kind. It's you in terms of your experience and consciousness. Why would that entity not be a person, simply because it didn't occupy some kind of biological space?

It's a thought experiment. If your thoughts and feelings could be imported into a machine in some way, say by creating a synthetic brain that maps one to one with your own neurons, housed in a robot body, on what grounds would that consciousness not be considered a person?


[06/12/2022 8:08 PM] chucked1993#0000
I do not know what I am outside of my context. If I was a brain in a jar, would I be a person? I know if my world is simulated to a brain in a jar, my personness is a result of that simulation, which in some sense gives me physicality.

On another topic, more in-line with our common ergo-centric interests, I am working with a company that is a leader in human ID systems. They have the most advanced technologies under their fingertips, alas - nothing that is blockchain related. I would like to introduce them to the potential benefits of adding blockchain (ideally ergo-based) ID to their toolbox; however, I am no expert in this area. Would be great if anyone here, that has some knowledge or understanding or any relevant references would be able to either post them here or DM me.

After years of studying it, I believe that cryptocurrency is an inherently right-wing, hyper-capitalistic technology built primarily to amplify the wealth of its proponents through a combination of tax avoidance, diminished regulatory oversight and artificially enforced scarcity.

 I dont cross paths with the non-active retail and doge imvestors. 

Otherwise, from my groups about half of the people actually care about some vision. The speculation, profits and influencers just catch all the attention. Catching attention is often their business. 

From the ideologically motivated bunch most are building something they don't intend. They just build without thinking the socio-economic dynamics. 

A smaller set are the ancaps who know, and prefer it the way it is. 

Then the smallest set is the Ergo type. Those are rare in other groups.

 Construction makes up somewhere between 25-30% of China's GDP. When that finally corrects, it'll be a 2008 Great Recession. Xi was going to try to unwind it, felt the pain, then decided to hold up until he gets his third term as General Secretary or Chairman position locked up. He might try again after a year or two, since he is a man of few ideas.

 The simple fact is that China is uncapable of taking Taiwan. Bombarding it into oblivion is possible. But, amphibious assault? They have an army of 2 million, 80% aren't able to operate outside their home districts and they are lucky if they have 100,000 with any kind of experience with amphibious assault. Probably need a million to do it, and even then, massive casualties. Makes D-Day look like a joke.

The SARS-CoV-2 furin cleavage site is yet again in the news - this time because of a quote by Nobel laureate David Baltimore.

The site is not a "smoking gun", nor does it "make a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin".

Quite the opposite, so a little science üßµüëá

Yea, the furin cleavage site codon sequence was patented by Moderna, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that Moderna/Wuhan leaked it purposefully or accidentally. Just a hypothesis based on what the researchers find highly unusual. It will be almost impossible to prove any view definitively

That's the point of the exercise. Flood the information space with bullshit because when one talks about Wuhan labs, you link it to Modesta or U.S. weapons lab or whatever to get people chasing their tails. All of it is speculation based on politics and worldview. Facts, if they are present at all, are irrelevant.

 It doesn't rule out a lab leak in the *scientific* sense, but there is also no reasoned argument for it. The paper you posted, other than the strangely worded conclusion - gives tons of evidence for how it actually happened but is complex enough to be used as a misinformation talking point (most discussions of this paper are on conspiracy sites) and preys on people not understanding just how not-unusual it is.

Huh? I just run BLAST (blastn, specifically) with that nucleotide sequence and found several eukaryotic genomes containing it in non MutS-like contexts, aligning sense and anti-sense strands, with 100% coverage and 100% identity. Besides, there is no ‚ÄúBLAST‚Äù database (I used the non-redundant -nr- one, for instance; BLAST is just the name of the tool). One possible reason they didn‚Äôt find the sequences is that BLAST, by default, only returns the first 100 hits, which in their case might have been prokaryotic ones. I didn‚Äôt check viral genomes but might later.

Disclaimer: I know and have used BLAST since my undergrad years, about a decade and a half ago.

 Yeah, the dialogue between speculation and operation is an ancient one. It was a huge discourse in the medieval craft guilds. And speculation was eventually completely divorced from the operative practices because of the two camps.

In real terms, speculation is an aspect of all new in technologies. Even as they were emerging in previous centuries like the weaving loom or the railway. In any venture there is always a degree of forecasting: what is coming next: like what could happen if we did x, y or z, and then speculation: the future this would produce a, b or c. So the heart of any form of technological progress is a degree of speculation.

For the forecasts that are true, speculation can help build some confidence in order to achieve the goals needed to overcome problems that have been identified. but a narrative that is false and speculate on can cause harm. 

I do think speculation can be good and bad. it's important not to throw the baby put with the bathwater. For example, if Noah can forecast a great flood, it's not a bad thing for him to advertise this, and share it widely as well as him building the boat. He might save some lives by doing that. So if speculation is rooted in some truth then it has the potential to help a lot of people.

 I agree that the speculation is inevitably tied to new technologies. 

I suppose I am trying to argue that in crypto the value proposition is different than what came before. There is the usual part of blockchain tech that can make things more efficient. The ownership can be decentralized or not. 

Then there is the value (for user) arising from not having middleman. That is a fee reduction that for-profit projects cant beat long term. Compared to a traditional coop, the difference is that you don't need the large structures to maintain user ownership. A smart contract could be without any maintenance. 

Now if you are a dev building a project, it is much more lucrative to make a token, slap a fee on the service, and raise money for marketing and liquidity. If you succeed, the network effect and liquidity concentration can consolidate the market for you. However, that is temporary. There can always come the next one, where a new game with the speculative token is just starting.

Or a free one, if the dev is in it for cutting out the middleman. With blockchain the effort to remove value extraction from users is lower than before.

 Sry, didnt have time to write a proper feedback yet, but here are some notes I made:


[07/20/2022 7:50 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
- the "free mint" is defined as 1% of dexy in LP in the draft. LP is supposed to be a metric of protocol health. That number can be manipulated, if a whale goes in and out of LP.

A better metric would be protocol owned dexy and erg in LP + ERG in bank. That is the actual protocol owned liquidity. I would tie that 1% free mint to that.


[07/20/2022 7:50 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
- payout could be gamed if it is just going to LPs. A whale could enter just before payout. It could be weighted by time spent in the LP. Or by time spent in LP when withdraw was locked.


[07/20/2022 7:51 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
- The large risk at start is the only major problem that I see. Otherwise I think it is a great design. Thank you for the acknowledgement.

[07/20/2022 9:22 PM] kushti#0000
Panic bank run would mean redemption with loss basically, for most of traders, due to nature of constant product LP. Here the protocol would be similar to Fei and Gyroscope. Massive bank run actually makes bank job easier, in comparison with worst case scenario.

 Yes. Lets assume,
- erg price 1$.
- protocol owned liquidity (POL) in LP worth 100 dexy(usd) and 100 erg.
- reserve in bank 100 erg.
- circulating supply on dexy(usd) is 600. 

Now total POL is 300, which means collateral ratio is 300/600=50%.

If no-one enter fresh capital, then one dexy should be worth 0.5 erg. Rational actors would sell until that point, and panickers might sell below. Selling below actually improves the health. 

Still, the point is that anything below 100% CR is a risk. And that can easily happen if there is a price drop after a lot of minting.


[07/21/2022 7:51 AM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
I am very busy atm, but I hope I find time to dig into the simulations. 

If there was some mechanism that ties total circulating supply to POL, then it would be possible to control for everything.

[07/21/2022 8:23 AM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
(re @kushti_ru : *Means stopping trading in the pool?*) 
 
 No. 
Bank intervenes if r<0.98
Withdrawing liquidity stops if r<0.98
Trading open all the time

If the goal of withdraw stop is to lock liq providers in at time of dexy dumping, then the intervention is in conflict with that goal. LPs can simply withdraw after an intervention, even if dumping cycle is still on. 

If withdraw is stopped at r<0.98 AND 1h after intervention, then the lock is more efficient in a scenario, where traders would immediately dump back to 0.98.

Labor unionism is a natural part of the market dynamic. It‚Äôs just not been excersized much in recent years.

It‚Äôs the same for a worker to down tools and ask for higher pay as it is for a sellers in commodities market to collectively to hold and choose not to sell at a lower price, and restrict demand until market price is suitable.


[08/08/2022 8:15 PM] louis_berlin_style#0000
It‚Äôs about time there was organised unionism too. Things getting a bit too silly with organised capital. Labour needs to get some equilibrium.

[08/08/2022 8:23 PM] louis_berlin_style#0000
There is an argument that much of the drastic swings in prices in commodities are due to overt speculation, and derivatives in the oil and wheat market. So the scarcity punch being felt is an artificial one brought about by overt profiteering through derivatives. This is the argument unions are taking as true.


[08/08/2022 8:29 PM] fruittree#0000
pay rise(be your own boss or be a wage slave), reduced energy bills(end centralized energy monopolies), an end to food poverty(grow a garden) and decent(by whose standards) homes for all(modern communism?).


[08/08/2022 8:45 PM] louis_berlin_style#0000
I see Unionism as different from communism. Often people that don‚Äôt like unions lump them into the same box as communists. But a market needs bargaining power from both ends- sellers and buyers.

If having capital is the power to buy work and goods, unionism is the method by which payment for work is decided. One of the most important parts of the market dynamic. Without it you arguably just have capital oppression, not free choice. People don‚Äôt like unions because increased unionism raises prices, also lowers the purchasing power of capital as people will demand for more in exchange for their work. 

But it also means that pricing for services and goods is more realistically priced according to costs of production, lowering exploitation. In an economy with organised Labour you have a strong currency, with lower debt. Each dollar is spent more wisely because the cost is more. 

Right now there is an overextended derivatives market, which is making people with capital have an excess of capital, and pricing people out of basic goods and necessities.

The housing market is one example, with the debt economy meaning you can‚Äôt have a decent career and just buy a nice house. You need to do some insane speculative investing backflip (god knows we all know what that feels like) 

but in an economy with higher labor power, you should be able to work and pay off a mortgage in fewer years. As it should be.


[08/08/2022 8:47 PM] louis_berlin_style#0000
also agree with ending monopolies generally. I don‚Äôt think that those ideas and unionism are mutually exclusive

 Problem is affordable housing, multi-unit, high-rise is incongruent with luxury. Another problem is that manufacturing processes haven't had inroads into home construction. Move from bespoke to more pre-fab and cost will go down, but that moves the market into commodities, reduces home prices, etc. All things building companies don't want.


[08/08/2022 9:01 PM] cafebedouin#0000
The other thing about capitalism is appropriating "surplus value" is how the system works. That's largely the difference between the value of workers labor in the final product and the wage they are paid. Much of the communist critique rests on this point.

I have bought land, materials, tools and built my own house. I think it is more about preferences or standards and location than access.


[08/08/2022 9:06 PM] louis_berlin_style#0000
Yeah. it‚Äôs a complex issue housing. 

Lot of the problems with housing are about insurance systems too.

But housing is integrally connected with employment and economies of scale you get in cities. So in a city where workers need to live(because they create value within that industry) workers should afford that housing.  So there should be some peg. 

A lot of it is to do with monopolies controlling supply and influencing lending conditions and supply conditions. 

U.K. for instance 5 house builders build like 95% of housing and have made it so that any ‚Äònon standard‚Äô construction (not brick) can‚Äôt be insured and you can‚Äôt get a mortgage on it.


[08/08/2022 9:06 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @fruittree : *you can buy a house in foreign countries pretty cheap*) 
 
 Cheap, from your perspective, because the same process works at the geopolitical level. Labor is comparitively "cheap" when you can make $200,000 as a physician in the United States when physicians in India make a fraction of that. Not to mention differences in exploitation from migrant labor, lack of infrastructure (water treatment, building codes, etc.) and so forth. Apples to oranges along a number of dimensions.

 in S.A. it is also cheap in their salaries, it is more so that the standards of what is a suitable home is a bit exaggerated. still most homes don't even get built to heat or power themselves, just to look modern..

I think these big businesses use leverage/bribery of government policies to corrupt the society into a warped reality. We need to spend our time and energy effectively to see results otherwise we end up just fighting with a moving goal post.

Often we expect solutions to come from within the systems, but I see the solutions to come from outside, where people build counter structures and use them. Then comes subversion into those projects like the lust for profit in crypto and suddenly the movements get derailed. 

So it is important to outline fundamentals.

 How are they going to target private repos? Crawl the internet looking for specific bits? Even if you find something, how do you take it offline when the server is in, say, Switzerland? Or hosted in a torrent? Or as a Tor Hidden Service?

U.S. has extradition treaties with most countries, but it I think you have to commit the crime in that jurisdiction. There are places that don't have an extradition treaty with the U.S., such as The Maldives, Morocco, Laos, and so forth. But, probably the best approach is not to rely on states but be anonymous.

(re @ady2333 : *I think it's more to set an example and reduce usage or people making privacy coins*) 
 
 I think this time the regulatory push will go further than that. FATF laid down the plan last year.

Financial action task force (FATF) is an international organization that makes guidelines on anti money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing. They did guidelines for crypto last year. Those guidelines are now being pushed through national legislations and enforcement.

Governance token holders, liquidity providers, code deployers, community organizers, and even miners can be categorized as Virtual asset service providers (VASP). They will be legally responsible for maintaining KYC, AML and other regulatory compliance.

This creates a great wall of surveillance. One side is regulated and centralized. The other is illegal and decentralized. They won't have cababilities to enforce everything for a few years, but just the fear of illegality will be enough to make privacy a fringe activity.


[08/12/2022 7:13 PM] chucked1993#0000
It depends on how many people use platforms that allow for privacy, like ergo. If it‚Äôs too widespread, it is harder to control and as long as there are countries that permit it, there will be a class of people utilizing it.


[08/12/2022 7:14 PM] chucked1993#0000
I think/hope decentralized private crypto will undermine the ability of centralized entities to control


[08/12/2022 7:18 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
This will not only be applied to mixers. DEXes, NFTs, etc. Will all need to answer to regulators.

Projects should think of a strategy on how they want to respond. 
1) team is responsible and ready to meet any demands.
2) DAO is responsible and ready to meet any demands.
3) everyone related to a project do top notch privacy, and don't meet any regulatory demands.

It will be easy for law enforcement to justify going after any project. Just play one of the many cards like AML, terrorism, russia sanctions...

At that point, any team member, code deployer, code writer, organizer, maintainer (including LP) may be held liable.

We don't know how hard the regulators will push, but I would not expect anything less than the FATF outlines.

If something is open source and outside jurisdiction it‚Äôs hard to control. I mean, piracy and the dark web exist and are difficult to take down.

 Such projects are being built with zk proofs. This requires approval from regulators.

A government could themself be the entity that grants a KYC wallet. Then you could prove that with zk proof, while operating with the approved platforms.

This would be an improvement to every single service storing your data.

 I looked at urbit. So, I set up a planet, then what? Seems like an effort to have people run their own servers. I cannot even get the nontechnical people around me to use a password manager or 2FA. I don't see what it fixes. Can you clue me in?

we have a book club on urbit you are welcome to come hang out with us

It's either 

A single-threaded interpreter running as a unix process that speaks udp protocol to a meshed network (and http to your browser).

Or a social experiment to see how much vague nonsense people are willing to take and how long it would take for people to reach that consensus.

Problems: Big business, and government over reach, corruption and coercion, use of tech to increase control.

Solutions I see: locally focused economies to prevent corruption through local person validation, not using technology, using private focused tech which is now considered a crime it seems. ; mixers, monero, maybe Ergo, conceal, nym?, ??

Daos are an attempt but no evidence of successful governance confronting corruption yet imo.

Anytime you say GNU/Linux you are channeling RMS. But, agree, you can like what someone has done and still think the person is an asshole.

(re @cafebedouin : *Anytime you say GNU/Linux you are channeling RMS. But, agree, you can like what someone has done and still think the person is an asshole.*) 
 
 But the correct term is GNU/Linux, Linux is just the kernel. I don't call a Mac OS "darwin", I don't call a windows system "windows NT" nor do I call Android "linux"


[08/15/2022 7:24 PM] Satergo#0000
GNU the OS already existed but they made a bad choice of kernel architecture (GNU Hurd) so it didn't get finished. Instead Linux came and they decided to use it. Free software philosophy is cool and when you just say "Linux", there is none of that. GNU is the free & open source software part.


[08/15/2022 7:25 PM] Satergo#0000
But I understand that Richard Stallman is the one who says this a lot and that it would make me seem like I like him for thinking the same on this


[08/15/2022 7:40 PM] cafebedouin#0000
I understand all of that. I've been using Linux since Slackware  circa 1998 and wrote my grad school papers using Applix because I couldn't be bothered to learn LaTeX. Agree with the general thrust of it, but I'm not going to use GNU/Linux because that is awkward af.

 It sounds a little awkward but I sometimes use it sometimes don't. Though when I'm searching for help with commands it hurts a little to write linux instead of gnu/linux


[08/15/2022 9:22 PM] Satergo#0000
I guess an appropriate compromise for those who don't want to say GNU is to append distro, at least this way the point of referring to the kernel as the OS is solved. Not the free software and all the GNU credit getting lost part though


[08/15/2022 9:24 PM] cafebedouin#0000
(re @mewtoshi : *It sounds a little awkward but I sometimes use it sometimes don't. Though when I'm searching for help with commands it hurts a little to write linux instead of gnu/linux*) 
 
 I think part of the issue is semantic. When I use Linux, I'm typically thinking of ecosystems. If there were more kernels, it might make sense to segment by kernels. As it is, you segment by distribution. So, you talk about Debian, Fedora, Arch derivatives.


[08/15/2022 9:26 PM] cafebedouin#0000
And it becomes weird too. Should we put OpenBSD in front of a lot of distributions because of ssh and all the other tools they created that aren't GNU?


[08/15/2022 9:26 PM] Satergo#0000
OpenBSD, FreeBSD etc have always confused me honestly


[08/15/2022 9:26 PM] Satergo#0000
And yeah there is also the argument of it all not being from GNU


[08/15/2022 9:29 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Also, I've tried Parabola with non-free excluded, and it had so many problems. Some of that was because I was using the ARM architecture, but I'm pretty sure it would have been a hot mess regardless.


[08/15/2022 9:31 PM] Satergo#0000
I'm not one of those that avoids proprietary software at all costs. If there are open-source alternatives, I absolutely use them instead but right now on my computer I have a proprietary GPU driver, and I don't mind it. There is an open source implementation, but I rather not spend time on that and do not want to risk having bugs


[08/15/2022 9:32 PM] Satergo#0000
Drivers are a special case. As are some very popular programs, but in those cases I can accept a worse program for it being free (price and philosophy) & open source


[08/15/2022 9:35 PM] cafebedouin#0000

 I used to be a bit of a zealot about it, although never cared about the GNU/Linux credit issue. The main thing, for me, is it has to work. Just to reach for an example top of mind, on ChromeOS, Citrix is brain-dead simple to install and use. Try the same on Ubuntu and be prepared to have a bad time.

 Ergopad has their DAO software Paideia that they are working on. They are also working on other projects such as some kind of fair NFT generation contract, doing the contracts for Blitz, etc. Spectrum seems like it is holding for the Vasil fork infrastrcuture. It's not clear what they are working on at the moment, but probably L2. Spectrum and Ergopad also have some kind of working agreement, but I'm not sure what it involves.

 Cheap, from your perspective, because the same process works at the geopolitical level. Labor is comparitively "cheap" when you can make $200,000 as a physician in the United States when physicians in India make a fraction of that. Not to mention differences in exploitation from migrant labor, lack of infrastructure (water treatment, building codes, etc.) and so forth. Apples to oranges along a number of dimensions.

What is the defence mechanism of Ergo, if mining pools or mining companies are forced to censor blocks? Users (nodes?) doing a soft fork?

On the most basic level, is the decentralization always dependent on the individuals who want to keep it up? The financial incentives and political structure just support it better (pow) or worse (pos).

Starting on the first principle, why not give the concensus in the hands of the people, instead of wealth by computational power or stake bags? For example, anon individuals getting to mine a block randomly. Give non-censoring users means to slash censoring users. If the censoring users take control, then we are back to user soft fork situation.

How does this improve the financial and political support for decentralization? Financially, there might always be a way to employ a lot of individuals to gain control, but it might be more difficult than accumulating hash power or stake. Politically, the rules to discourage censoring could be more explicit. Make incentives that promote that basic principle of users wanting decentralization. 

As an added benefit, emissions would go to users. The network could even shut out users that dont have IDs. To protect anonymity, the ID that takes part in keeping up concensus could be used to create other wallets with zk-proofs. This way, the chain would be exclusive to people who actively support decentralization.

The most obvious problem is decentralized ID verification. National IDs or social media is centralized, even if decentralized oracle brings it on-chain. Proof via network of friends and biometrics seem difficult to scale without gatekeepers. Idena and ErgoNation type synchronized captcha looks promising, at least until AI beats human efforts to identify AI.

What other pitfalls are there in unique people validating a chain? 

@kushti_ru  ,  you have thought a lot about pow vs pos consensus. Have you also done research <clipped message>

 People as validators is centralization and leads to an easy bottleneck for governments to target. The U.S. regularly sanctions individuals it believes is working against its interests. If these are anons validators you'd probably need DIDs for it, and a government with the resources of the U.S. could probably figure out who is who.

AFAIK, there is no way to screen out addresses at the protocol level with Ergo. The screening would happen at the CEX level and dapp level that would face legal liability.

 US could most likely de-anon anything given the resources.

But does this not apply to pow and pos to a stronger degree? Large miners or stake pools are easier target than equal set of validators?

 If you take out large miners, it increases the appeal for smaller pools. If getblok presents a trend, how do you take out a pool that is governed by on chain smart contract? There's infrastructure there, but harder to target. Easy to imagine that getting back to the original vision but with pools, people hosting infrastructure locally and mining to a on chain smart contract pool.

 The same applies to DID validators? Take out some, more imcemtive for new to enter. Just more difficult to have a.big impact on one go.

The smart contract pool might be different. I dunno enough about it. If yes, then it is pretty awesome.


[08/18/2022 4:35 PM] chucked1993#0000
The variable cost of mining makes the network makes it more resilient against attack/centralization. There will always be costs associated with energy and equipment. And competition between mining pools is more transparent.

Smart pools add a layer to miner anonymity, and give PoW networks more versatility. 

In Proof of Stake just capital is sufficient to secretly control a network.

Anonymous ID based nodes can eventually be gamed by those who have resources in a more permanent way. Getting more IDs gives centralized parties an edge

 I think maybe it is easier to accumulate mining power than accumulate DIDs. Not sure.

The other side of the coin is flexibility as you mention. Miners can faster jump in and out. DIDs, especially with reputation requirements, would be sticky.

 I think you may be right. But creating a DID validator system requires people to do the Work instead of the miner. Will people take part in monthly events? 

It‚Äôs stickier if people start doing it, but it‚Äôs harder to get people to do it.

Mining is an automatic process with continuous costs. DID validation is a manual process with continuous costs

 DID validation does not have much costs at all. The work part is not needed. Just time and manual effort.

Mining probably takes more activity per month?

The fact that it does not tie real world assets (pow) or virtual assets (pos) is a really big difference. 

Maybe the DID and reputation could be seen as the 'stake'. Losing it would mean loss of future block rewards.


[08/18/2022 6:28 PM] chucked1993#0000
Yea, DID and reputation is a stake that needs ongoing manual effort (monthly verification), similar to the ongoing cost of securing PoW.

Ongoing effort (manual or mining) for
ownership of a network is necessary for long term security.

Fixed effort (stake) giving permanent ownership in a network is a security flaw, which leads to centralization/attack vectors

 Thanks. I see that without the financial stake, the sybil / clickfarm become larger threats.

The stake would have to be reputation and future financial gain.

Then the problem is defining the rules so that the reputation cannot be gamed. That would be very difficult in an automated way without gatekeepers at scale. 

ErgoNation type of reputation design always leaves the ability for the social layer (projects and community) to adapt in defence of sybil. There  human interaction can be used as reputational markers, which identifies sybil/clickfarm. The same might not be applicable to blockchain consensus, which would probably have to be pre-defined.

 I, too, don't have a high opinion of mass decision-making, but it still seems better in every way to the autocracy, with its loyalty to an individual and a faction above all else.


[09/08/2022 9:16 PM] chucked1993#0000
We are here to build a better system that hopefully increases/improves mass decision-making. Churches and monarchies are vestigial, virtue signaling institutions. Hopefully their power continues to plummet

ok but my statement included the notion that at least there could be seen who was actually in charge ... whereas today it seems no one knows... to who to we redress pur grievences !? and also , the notion that a proper monarchy is only oriented to itself is a pretty contemporary view and ignores the most important part of the equation which is the Sovereign... i should be clear that modern monarchies like the current one are long gone and I am referring to times and a character type long gone from our age....

and just curiously , what is it that the modern system is "oriented toward" ? i cant see anything except sentimentality and gynocratic safety prioritization on the plastic surface whilst underneath teems and heaves a wretched pit of occult forces that far surpasses the vilest imaginings of the lowest among us... an orientation of apathy and nihilism seems to be , up until now , the worst of all the cosmologies humanity has passed through... what could be worse ? we will surely see !

 In charge, most corporations have someone "in charge", yet it doesn't seem to work like you think it does. There's always someone to scapegoat.

the atheistic forces of modernity just in 100 years caused more death and destruction than all religions combined over millenia ... this is no apologia for the problems with institutional religion and what MEN have done with it ... anyway go read the crisis of the modern world by rene guenon 

medieval peoples were far more "civilized" than this age ever will be .

anyway , has anyone leads or info or even thoughts on the btc maxi arguments in the context of this project ? has it been discussed ? 

does erg team think as one on this ? are we really gonna have a multi chain world or will btc eventually implement everything through layers 2 and 3 and then everyone goes there because of network security ?

[09/08/2022 11:04 PM] chucked1993#0000
Spirituality and economics are not mutually exclusive. There is post-religion spirituality and there were market forces in medieval times. Modernity just has made markets and spirituality more frictionless. The dogma of old institutions are melting away. Religion and chivalry are old control mechanisms, not a requirement for spirituality. I will read Rene Guenon though, thanks for the suggestion


[09/08/2022 11:08 PM] sunshadow#0000
at any rate , anyone actively thinking about what i said and not wanting to be pedantic can deduce that at the very least , the ratios were very different ... back then most people EVERYWHERE , had a much greater depth and experience of some kind of faith and tradition ... this offsets, informs and even replaces some of those economic concerns by virtue of the qualities of the tradition and what is emphasized - family bonds and the security that provides,  for instance... 

hold this in contrast to the absolute absense of these qualities of the modern isolated individualist nihilist big banger whacker offer,  frantically trying to survive in a giant industrial machine whilst hurtling through a meaningless and infinite vaccuum toward a black hole to be dismembered for eternity , atom by hypothetically-constructed atom ... lmao no thanks im going with the planck satellite CMB discovery exit

"not a requirement for spirituality" ... maybe not for you ... but do you ever think that maybe there are some for whom their constitution simply REQUIRE such stable exoteric forms to engage in ... ? 

is it perhaps to bold to suggest that everyone is ready for such "freedom" ? is it freedom ? is there such a thing at all ?

imo you are always trading prisons so best be very careful probably best to sit silent and watch even (alas , i speak now and i know this - maybe i shall fall silent later) ... also imo history/time is a fall and a disintegration, not an ascent or an evolution, simply because the greater cannot proceed from the lesser ... the perfection was "back there" at the beginning ...
if anyone has "scientific" qualms about evolutionism or current year cosmology and wants to witness a most calm and diplomatic destruction of both neo-darwinism and bigbootybang cosmology , might I recommend https://bit.ly/3x6dxwk

 We are all downstream Adam eating the apple from the Tree of Knowledge, isn't it? Yes, definitely worth some thought. History moves from thesis -> antithesis -> synthesis.

I think to main questions are how to avoid the problems that come from outside the benevolent intentioned systems. The larger the system the faster and stronger the corruption of the main actors.

This leads to smaller more decentralized government systems being one aspect to help reduce corruption because the number of bad actors goes up relative to the number of local systems and their diversity in defensive mechanisms.

Main topic I see is how to avoid the corruption of governing roles. Socialism, communism, dictatorships etc are more centralized to start with and then lead faster to a corruptible centralized result. Democracy still has it's issue of forcing majority on the minority instead of allowing the minority freedom of government, or general universal rights.

I think agorism, anarchy are some clear winners as there would be an approach like universal rights/ constitution/ primary values which the people regard like laws, then people go into private contracts for the rest of the sub-governing rules. Hopefully people would heavily focus on ways to avoid corruption and centralization in this model also.

 The problem with corporations, and other organizations built around that model, is the layers of "management". Also, C-level executives making +7 figures with golden parachutes is bullshit.

 The problem with anarchism and agorism is it doesn't scale and capitalism destroys alternatives through an embrace, extend, extinguish strategy.

Matter is essentially multiplicity and division; and this, be it said in passing, is why all that proceeds from matter can beget only strife and all manner of conflicts between peoples and between individuals. The deeper one sinks into matter, the more the elements of division and opposition gain force and scope; and, on the other hand, the more one rises towards pure spirituality, the nearer one approaches to that unity which can only be fully realized by consciousness of the universal principles.

 I don't see that necessarily connected with those two models, nor capitalism. I mainly see the freedom from force involvement as an important pillar of anarchism / agorism. 

Voluntarism is another term for similar models and further shows where I am going with this point of saying these are superior systems because they are voluntary and based on voluntary private contracts.

Alternatively many of these other system use violence and military or police to force taxation or market manipulation, centralization etc.

I would like to reiterate that imo the importance is firstly on avoiding corruption and coinciding with individuals rights and freedoms, whichever system comes there after will be generally acceptable.


[09/09/2022 3:24 PM] fruittree#0000
I've read a lot of literature about anti corruption in open government systems but haven't seen it practiced in large scale. Anytime these principles were to be applied at a national or global scale, I am pretty certain the society will flourish under almost any governing model.

[09/09/2022 3:33 PM] fruittree#0000
The past predicting future is not always true. The army can be the individual and the weapons can be the information, coin, pen and dogmas or ideologies. I think the strongest militaries etc have been based on beliefs however inaccurate they were to outsiders.  An idea of an enemy is usually only that.

I have been thinking about governance lately and noticed that one governance mechanism, whistleblowing, is ignored by many ecosystems and projects. Many projects have bug bounties and offer bounties to whitehats, but that's only focusing on bad code and not bad people. Since in comparison to tradfi companies, DAOs financial actions are neither audited nor regulated and supervised, there is a lot more space for fraud and insider activities. Of course there is a lot crypto whistleblowing activity on Twitter, but I don't think that's optimal and not all whistleblowers are confident enough to risk making it public themselves (or dm someone else without knowing his reaction).

There are websites like https://cryptowhistleblower.com/,
but they are run by US lawyers who want to report to the SEC and US authorities (and probably don't care about DAOs and projects on Ergo). Also my main concern is not prosecution, but protection of users.

That's why I am thinking about creating an "ecosystem agency for whistleblowers". For the start I am just thinking about a twitter account and email where people can anonymously submit evidence. Additionally, one would probably need a few people who are informed about the ecosystems, but aren't member of any (for profit) project team to check the evidence and accusations. I don't think there would be a lot work (I hope none), but imo one should form the "team" before the first accusation, because searching for team members once there is an accusation might attract again people with bad intentions.

Later we could think about bounties for whistleblowers, which might cover their losses from damaging the project they are involved in.

What do you think about it? Does anyone want to become part of the team? I am asking here, because here are many people not involved in projects who are active and knowledgeable and this group is public.

 Makes sense. Most of the stuff is not actually trustless, and insider dealings are rampant. Even hacks are often insiders or auditors who detect the vulnerabilities.

 Another way of looking at it, a better stablecoin.

Better in this case meaning a counter-cyclical asset.

(re @cafebedouin : *Another way of looking at it, a better stablecoin.*) 
 
 Yes. Gold beats usd as a stable asset.

I mean for the health of the protocol. Ignoring all the technicals, there is erg as the backing. If gold goes up strong relative to erg, then that backing might not hold.

 I don't really understand how Dexy works, but what I've gathered is that the incentives are set to correct from deviation from the peg, and it isn't backed by anything. Also, gold itself is a volatile asset, so the protocol is going to be stressed tested because two volatile assets are involved.

 Not only incentives. A larger deviation from the peg triggers correction using erg. That erg is gathered from minting and fees.

 It is a liability isn't it. Property is expensive, illiquid, and not really divisible.  Yea, the risk is high because it is capital intensive making it harder to diversify. This is a good post

The trick with all law is enforcement. If you can't enforce it, it effectively doesn't matter. Governments will co-opt crypto, but the prohibition of alt forms that they don't like is a different task.

The DCCPA greatly threatens DeFi innovation.

The proposed bill: 

- gives CFTC new powers to regulate spot markets
- forces human intermediation 
- forces projects to sacrifice decentralization

It favors centralized incumbents and kills startups.

 It depends on how it‚Äôs enforced. Harder enforcement will lead to less social participation: Jail > fines > Letters telling you to stop. 

Harder forms of enforcement in crypto will be difficult to justify and may illicit more public resistance. It‚Äôs more obvious to call for enforcement against drugs/piracy because of the health/social consequences or how they relate to moral traditions against stealing/murder. What makes crypto  inherently immoral is less clear.

Even now we are seeing increasing lenience in some nations with the decriminalization of drugs and softer  enforcement.  For there to be a shift in policy to have a hard stance against crypto, then we are going to be living in a very different kind of society.

 Terrorism, money laundering, criminal markets, dodging financial regulation etc. Those have been already used, and they warrant harder enforcement. That can be applied to anyone who does not identify and comply


[10/21/2022 11:54 AM] chucked1993#0000
But that‚Äôs not crypto specific, so targeting platforms specific to those crimes are more likely than anything widespread. Depends on the % of non-criminal population participation in crypto. We think of worst cases, but I think we underestimate difficulty or overestimate the ability of regulators to deal with this (especially in a timely manner), especially when they have bigger issues to deal with.

 Law enforcement is not easy.

Writing scary regulation, regulator awareness on the topic, and its time of delivery is underestimated imo. Or more precisely, people and projects dont pay attention beyond headlines.


[10/21/2022 12:05 PM] Vesi Hiisi#0000
From financial regulation point of view it is straightforward. There is a technology-independent principle of "same risk, same rules". 

I dont see how true defi could comply with that, and I dont see how the regulator would make exception.

 Is that type of gearing directed toward users taking responsibility for understanding the infrastructure they are using? When it comes to new developments in "dapps", what would be the correct point of view? 

Considering direct finances and software is really interesting to me. People have been able to share and create on a global scale for a long time now thanks to open licensing and software development. With blockchain development, will users look towards projects that openly support bug bounties as a form of security / protection?

It's interesting to think about. If there is no one to essentially be held accountable, where will users feel safe? Decentralization doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that accountability should not be held, but rather no one to blame? It‚Äôs almost like an endless game of pong.


[10/23/2022 5:42 AM] Bobatoshi#0000
It's nice to think about bug bounties for decentralized projects, but the real issue is funding. It usually takes some kind of reward to sway someone away from being malicious and towards being positive. I wonder if it would be possible to reward people based on recognition, that would be neat to think about.

 System of responsibility and blame has been done already. That path would probably just re-create tradfi.

Immutability is the unique difference that blockchain enables. Deploy, hack, fix, re-deploy is an evolutionary process that can over time produce a new, more secure system.

Bug bounties could maybe speed up that process.

* as a caveat, changes in early phase maybe ok. Also, accoubtability in local systems is ok and decentralized as a whole.

 I think this is specialized knowledge. The advantages of those places is they don't have state income taxes. But, regulations are probably state specific and probably the average person in the state isn't going to know those rules.

 Yeah, you'd better consult a lawyer or CPA from the state you want to go into. There might be a tax for importing business related assets, and there will certainly be steps to take to optimize your tax bill after making some money here. Someone there would be able to tell you what to to specifically. Maybe something like establishing an LLC in that state, then selling yourself the equipment on paper.

 Yeah, there is still a lot room for improvements with respect to warnings.

E.g. the UI warning for token burning which was introduced in Nautilus after Noah burned his assets. 

Or a warning that one sells a nft for x% under floor price and asking for a second confirmation if x is large.

 It can be a sore point. Personally, I just use anarchist because then the conversation turns to what anarchy means, which can be a useful dialogue with those that equate it with "law of the jungle". Yes, it's possible to have programs by large organizations, even states, that work on an anarchic model, which drives people to think you are either a madman or someone with a novel idea they haven't heard before. But, libertarian? Then, I have to explain that I'm one of those libertarians. It's already hard enough to break those associations being associated with crypto.

Forwarded from Robin Monotti + Dr Mike Yeadon + Cory Morningstar: Personally I don‚Äôt draw a hard distinction between totalitarian (absolute) tyranny and depopulation. Life is not worth living in an environment where freedom is permanently extinguished. 

So it‚Äôs time (while continuing to care for the injured & hold the perpetrators to account) to refocus our gaze on the next steps to tyranny that the perpetrators have planned.

If we don‚Äôt, if we continue to fight yesterdays battle, we will lose this war.

Global warming is a lie.

The idea that the world is overpopulated is a lie.

Neither statement is ‚Äúdenialism‚Äù. Self appointed elites have invested hugely over at least 50 years to get to the position that most people believe we‚Äôre destroying the climate & that there are too many of us. 

One of the absolutely crucial tools that the elites will use to impose absolute control is CASHLESS, DIGITAL MONEY.

It‚Äôs very important that people understand that our current online banking is in no way equivalent to central bank digital currency (CBDC). 

When you spend now using a bank card or an app, all that happens is that the merchants computer asks if you‚Äôre good for the transaction. The bank isn‚Äôt evaluating what you‚Äôre proposing to buy, or where, nor is it integrating its assessment using all other transactions you‚Äôve made. The reconciliation of credits & debts which have arisen between the banks serving the consumers and merchants is run just once daily. This system is hopelessly unsuitable for exerting high level control over every transaction to be made by every person in real time. It cannot do so. While there‚Äôs no question that these non real time systems can be set up to make certain categories of transaction difficult, it‚Äôs a blunt instrument. 

By contrast, in a cashless CBDC world, each individual transaction is assessed in real time & is highly specific & personal. Y <clipped message>

Michael Yeadon is a British anti-vaccine activist and retired pharmacologist who attracted media attention for making false or unfounded claims about the COVID-19 pandemic and the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. The Times has described him as "a hero of Covid conspiracy theorists" and "a key figure in the antivax movement".

you can always resort to devaluing sources or characters like the climate change skeptic / historian last time when we talked on That issue. That historian guy had a lot of sources and there is a lot to look at, which I found rather convincing.

I‚Äôm devauling them because they‚Äôve shown to be worthless, manipulative sources‚Äî Peddling out of context lines from studies to people who don‚Äôt have the tools to interpret them. 

Not sure why you‚Äôre linking the above study, seems to be mostly what you‚Äôd expect. Some bad conclusions drawn from the data on the smaller groups. Unfortunately a large majority of scientists does not understand what they can and cannot do with data, and how they are supposed to interpret the results with respect to their studies biases and weakenesses. This seems to be one such case.

There are no ‚Äògotcha‚Äôs‚Äô. There is what what the data shows and what it doesn‚Äôt show. Depending on your setup and control of variables the data can have different strengths/weaknesses. It might be possible to find reasons for anomalies depending on design. If none you can assume the data is correct and look for either agreement or dissagreement in other studies with similar design that can strengthen or weaken the hypothesis. 

We have hundreds of thousands of independent people doing that in universities, and lots of open discussion. Then you have crackpots peddling ‚Äòvax is control, climate change is BS- we‚Äôre being cancelled!‚Äô, and you end up with hundreds of thousands extra dead & people and can‚Äôt go outside for 2yrs because it‚Äôs became acceptable to lie and never accept that you‚Äôre wrong.

 I was thinking a potential positive could be that cbdc's would make it easier for people to access crypto. If they are already using a digital currency, they would be more likely to use another one like btc or erg. I imagine the fiat onramps would have fewer hurdles since the cbdc assumes kyc and you don't need to do it again through coinbase or whatever

[10/27/2022 12:27 AM] fruittree#0000
i think it will be harder, they would just not allow any transaction they don't want and if it is crypto they won't want it.


[10/27/2022 12:29 AM] TIMRŒ£G7#0000
There will be a transition period. If it came to a point of total control, then sure, it would be difficult. I think people are going to hit the brakes on cbdc's when it makes its way to america

 Mr. Rodgers has this story/saying that people only change their minds when they are engaged in conversation with someone that loves them. I think that's true because an opinion often is part of a worldview, and the opinion changes only in so far as our worldview changes. But, I'd say that all of us are committed to our point of view. Few people want to change themselves. And strangely, many of us think it is easier to change the world than it is to change ourselves.

 I think this approach only fits if the outcomes have little in real world applications or when the people have little physical interaction. In these cases it is simple to say essentially let's not talk about it. This fits for the topics above somewhat well. Neither of us have an influence on these topics and we are not required to involve with one another. 

In other situations like where choices are being made with real application this approach you linked to is not applicable, and I think that is why we see people often debating online because it is like a training ground for the realer world.

That often results in the better debater and not the truth being followed.. and maybe that's what people imaginarily train their minds to prevent or become..


I think Marshall Rosenberg would have a skilled approach of trying to paraphrase and empathize to get beyond the talking points and into the individuals needs and desires.

"hearing oneself talk" is more nicely said as a need for communication or connection with others. 

If all our goals were to just Isolate and be alone, we would not have any debates or communication and would not be in these chat rooms. But here we are, even entering texts into the box.
You are a good example, of being uncertain what to say if anything. but certainly wanting to say something, I think what you said was nice maybe besides the roses part. :)

A fundamental difference I see is that following the mainstream narrative empowers action through force and coercion, 
like glasgows sarcasm (or not) about CBDCs limiting antivaxers. 

The biggest issues are levels of theft are at the top positions of business and government immediately syphoning from these choices being made and i think we agree but are on opposite ends that this results in massive amounts of misinformation. Glasgow thinks the misinformation ends with right wing dark internet media outlets, I think it extends to the paid for science incl. vaccine and climate models and temperature recording alterations etc. 

I think part of the reason for pushing our opinions online or debating is that we want a unified voice to further to reduce the overall issues in society. First obstacles are reaching consensus.

 CBDCs is just the next logical step in monetary-driven totalitarian control, which is already slowly going on over everything due to MMT (modern monetary theory) based practices. While MMT looks flawless per se in its reasoning about nature of money, taxes, debts and govt accounting (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5JTn7GS4oA for introduction), it inevitably puts govt in control of basically everything money can control, in the long term, so basically everything in a capitalist society, but also without (direct) responsibility (at least as a govt does not need for taxes anymore in order to survive).  

And for sure, there will be no privacy with CBDCs, and they will be used to control behavior of masses and  oppress individuals, financial systems already doing that.

I can also respect having reservations about mRNA as a vaccine platform, which we don't have a lot of experience with. At the same time, it shows a lot of promise.

The problem, in my view, is that most people look for information after they've made up their minds. And minds tends to be made up around different orthodoxies and identities. If you are Catholic, you tend to have a set of beliefs that go along that identity. And that's true of the vast majority of beliefs: religion, politics, social characteristics, etc. And intersectionality, often used for overlapping oppressions of minority groups, is also relevant here. If you consider yourself "a life-long Republican", it implies that you are U.S. citizen (with some kind of nationalist baggage that at its worse believes the U.S. is the "greatest country on earth") and that you are probably white, straight, believe in some form of Christianity and have some views about society that is looking backward, i.e., socially conservative.

That's the ground base for your truth. If you want to talk about abortion, you're going to talk about souls. And for a topic like climate change, the bitter  <clipped message>

The vaccine efficacy has dropped with omicron. Omicron is more transmissible and less virulent. But people weren‚Äôt certain that future variants would necessarily carry these characteristics.

 Think of it like this. Newtonian physics -> Einstein physics -> unified physics. This is a change that is a product of skepticism and incompleteness. Better frameworks of understand allow us to build and manipulate our surroundings better. That is, absolute truth isn‚Äôt required for meaning to exist. The pursuit is sufficient to derive value from. That is, if we later find the limit on the speed of light is a local phenomenon (to our universe or otherwise), and that new truth expands our understanding it will be integrated. More precisely, there is only relative truth/morality and that‚Äôs okay. This is the process that drove us to becoming somewhat symmetrical sentient apes who knows where it takes us.

 Problem is that people want 100% truth. As far as science goes, speed of light is as close as it gets, and there's reason to doubt. Where there's doubt, people will fill the space with their ideas, which drives the truth value down further.

 The majority of scientists probably doesn't ask such questions like "do laws of nature change with time" or "are there laws of nature". Kuhn would probably say they do mop-up work. I think that's okay. Otherwise, there probably would be no engineering done ever. We need those people for "progress". But I would love to see scientists talk more about philosophy of science. 

For me 100% truth comes only in if - then statements. That's okay for me, because I am used to it from mathematics. But I think for most people that is pretty hard to accept. And I think for most scientists as well. On the one hand, because if you move away from philosophy and mathematics in the direction of science, the number of implicit assumptions increases and basically makes it impossible to be aware of all of them and on the other hand, because they want to show more than if-then statements afer working for years on the same topic.

 In binary logic, every proof that something is false is also a proof that the negation is true ü•≥

But even useful proofs by contradiction are impossible in basically every scientific discipline, because of the Duhem-Quine thesis.

So, for science one probably has to aim for confirmation (which is again a very difficult concept) instead of truth or falsehood.

 Sure was thinking more a general truth Vs disproving a specific (flawed) hypothesis. But as far as consensus goes for anthropogenic climate change I believe it's now way more robust than our understanding of gravity. 99.9% in agreement

[10/27/2022 8:57 PM] chucked1993#0000
Let‚Äôs say that burning coal was necessary for us to advance as an industrial society and that is generally a good thing. Now we have alternatives such as nuclear that can produce necessary amounts of energy. So knowing the costs of burning fossil fuels we should switch methods of energy production, while reabsorbing carbon back into sinks. Fight deforestation/promote biodiversity


[10/27/2022 8:57 PM] glasgowm#0000
One of the most compelling to me is we can look at atomic "fingerprints" in the gasses in the atmosphere. CO2 coming out of coal plants is different in atomic composition than CO2 coming out of volcanos.

The only way the delta-C-13 ratios in the atmosphere can be what they are is from Carbon emissions from fossil fuel sources burned on the surface. That is a smoking gun that has no other explanation.


[10/27/2022 8:58 PM] chucked1993#0000
The problem with denying climate change is that it‚Äôs essentially promoting burning fossil fuels, which isn‚Äôt necessary at this point. Humanity is causing existential risk to line some people‚Äôs pockets


[10/27/2022 8:59 PM] ady2333#0000
I'm not denying climate change


[10/27/2022 8:59 PM] ady2333#0000
I do think it's real


[10/27/2022 8:59 PM] ady2333#0000
I just think it's early in terms of research


[10/27/2022 8:59 PM] ady2333#0000
Most of research seems to be on fossil fuels


[10/27/2022 8:59 PM] ady2333#0000
Yet there's factors like urbanisation that also play a role


[10/27/2022 8:59 PM] chucked1993#0000

Climate change denial is a boon for Big Oil. So you have to see the downstream effects of you not believing in it. All it really does is prevent civilization from using better energy sources. We are smoking cigarettes even though we know it causes cancer.

Yep we need to do everything and hope its enough. But main problem is our current output is causing cascading micro system collapse and on the verge of macro system collapse; so carbon sinks wont cut it.

(re @cafebedouin : *Deductive logic has very limited explanatory power, particularly in complex systems where all variables are not known, which is practically everything human beings care about it.*) 
 
 I would say it has basically 0 explanatory power (since all you end up with was already contained in the assumptions), but one can talk about truth without waving hands too much.


[10/27/2022 10:03 PM] Gstoiti#0000
I view deductive logic and mathematics as a game: you agree on rules (axioms) and then you can play. Nobody knows whether the rules are true, but if they are true your moves also produce truth. Actually I think there are some people who care about this (like me).

Then some people might argue that some rules resemble some things "human beings care about". That's where one substitutes aiming for truth with aiming for confirmation and consensus. That's probably what most people care about.

Yes but they know this, and know the reasons; it's not some unknown or hotly debated topic. It's a cherry picked data point that has been reposted and spread as misinformation
`one location and temperature variations seen in ice core records may not be characteristic of global temperatures. `

And, using GISP2 data within the larger picture of climate science demonstrates that our scientific understanding is good, supports our expectation of global warming, but raises the small-chance-of-big-problem issue that in turn influences the discussion of optimal human response.

[10/28/2022 4:48 PM] chucked1993#0000
The impact isn‚Äôt only how many will die or not. But creating a situation which moves from equilibrium (with increases in natural disaster and destruction of arable land etc.) will have a cost. We will not be able to react to the economic costs, leading to a more chaotic system. 

The shock doctrine is used but politicians as a means to maintain control. So people, maybe rightly, think the alarm by politicians now is just a means of gaining control. But the researchers have been saying this for a century and it‚Äôs fallen on relatively deaf ears. 

If a person gets treatable cancer, they have a choice to receive treatment from an expert or not. If you choose to ignore the expert, don‚Äôt be surprised if you end up dying. 

I don‚Äôt fully understand the purpose of not taking climate change as a serious threat. Dealing with a threat has the upside of future survival.

just give it 1 generation and i'm certain billions of people will die


[10/29/2022 9:23 PM] ady2333#0000
But what would cause it?


[10/29/2022 9:23 PM] Amine#5231
old age


[10/29/2022 9:23 PM] ady2333#0000
Lol


[10/29/2022 9:24 PM] ady2333#0000
Yeah apparently average age is rising


[10/29/2022 9:24 PM] ady2333#0000
Soon we wont have enough workers to support the population


[10/29/2022 9:24 PM] Amine#5231
tbh i'd rather die healthy than live 30 years with all sorts of dysfunctions


[10/29/2022 9:25 PM] Amine#5231
yeah


[10/29/2022 9:25 PM] Amine#5231
cuz birth rates right?


[10/29/2022 9:25 PM] ady2333#0000
(re  : *<Amine> tbh i'd rather die healthy than live 30 years with all sorts of dysfunctions*) 
 
 Same


[10/29/2022 9:25 PM] ady2333#0000
(re  : *<Amine> cuz birth rates right?*) 
 
 Yeah birth rate reducing in developed economies


[10/29/2022 9:25 PM] ady2333#0000
And people living to older age


[10/29/2022 9:26 PM] Amine#5231
what is it about developed economies that underdevelopped don't have


[10/29/2022 9:26 PM] ady2333#0000
Not sure probably a mixture of things


[10/29/2022 9:26 PM] Amine#5231
developed economies got more money and stuff so if anything they should be banging more


[10/29/2022 9:26 PM] ady2333#0000
Education being one


[10/29/2022 9:26 PM] ady2333#0000
Yeah but things cost more aswell


[10/29/2022 9:27 PM] ady2333#0000
More expenses


[10/29/2022 9:27 PM] Amine#5231
true


[10/29/2022 9:27 PM] Amine#5231
4 years before i graduate and i'll probably still be bitchless


[10/29/2022 9:27 PM] ady2333#0000
And usually more busy with work


[10/29/2022 9:27 PM] ady2333#0000
I mean even in developed economies seems like the poor procreate more than the rich


[10/29/2022 9:28 PM] Amine#5231
really?


[10/29/2022 9:28 PM] ady2333#0000
I dunno but I live in a shitty area and u see alot of jobless people with kids


[10/29/2022 9:28 PM] ady2333#0000
Government kinda incentives it


[10/29/2022 9:29 PM] Amine#5231
yeah so that draws a clear link between beeing poor and raising more kids


[10/29/2022 9:30 PM] ady2333#0000
Lol


[10/29/2022 9:30 PM] Amine#5231

[10/29/2022 9:30 PM] Gstoiti#0000
I guess also on average richer people get better sex education, better access to birth control and abortion,...


[10/29/2022 9:30 PM] Amine#5231
if ur educated


[10/29/2022 9:31 PM] Amine#5231
why on earth would u come to the conclusion that having less children is good


[10/29/2022 9:31 PM] ady2333#0000
(re  : *<Amine> why on earth would u come to the conclusion that having less children is good*) 
 
 I guess it's different priorities


[10/29/2022 9:31 PM] ady2333#0000
If u are educated u are going to probably a better career


[10/29/2022 9:31 PM] ady2333#0000
Which might be prioritised over having kids


[10/29/2022 9:32 PM] Amine#5231
yeah better career means better life means u can raise more kids


[10/29/2022 9:32 PM] ady2333#0000
(re  : *<Amine> yeah better career means better life means u can raise more kids*) 
 
 Raise kids to do what?


[10/29/2022 9:32 PM] ady2333#0000
What's the end goal


[10/29/2022 9:32 PM] Amine#5231

(re  : *<Amine> why on earth would u come to the conclusion that having less children is good*) 
 
 Why would you come to the conclusion that having kids is good?

I think on average richer people are better educated and have more time to allocate freely (although some allocate it to work), so they might think more about the purpose of life and are less caught in the traditional role model of families. Also more money means you have to rely less on your children once you get older.


[10/29/2022 9:34 PM] ady2333#0000
I think relying on kids when u older is good


[10/29/2022 9:34 PM] ady2333#0000
Even if you are rich


[10/29/2022 9:34 PM] Amine#5231

(re @ady2333 : *I think relying on kids when u older is good*) 
 
 A long-term care insurance policy strikes me as a cheaper and better bet.

bruh imagine ur on ur deathbed and the room is filled with kids who are successful and all thankful for you helping them through life


[10/29/2022 9:35 PM] Gstoiti#0000
(re @ady2333 : *I think relying on kids when u older is good*) 
 
 I don't know. I had to take care of my parents and grandparents and it wasn't fun once they were very ill. For both sides.


[10/29/2022 9:35 PM] Amine#5231
but if u have a lot of kids it's a lot less harder right?

(re @Gstoiti : *I don't know. I had to take care of my parents and grandparents and it wasn't fun once they were very ill. For both sides.*)

 If you have money, someone who is trained in taking care of ill people can do that. And kids can visit to have fun together

 That's why I say that good, well paid people who are educated to do that are the best case. Then people who like the person can visit and talk about the good times.

if being more educated leads to you having less kids then i think we could say that we are being brainwashed instead of being educated since education should laed u to the conclusion that having more kids is better

 Oldest man is currently 116 years. Also, in the United States, 40% of the people over 80 have some form of serious cognitive impairment in the form of dementia, Alzheimer's, etc. Also 20% of people over the age of 65 have no teeth in the U.S. I'd bet that's a mortality indicator. Probably have some longevity improvements before you are above 100, but 130 is probably optimistic.

 Certainly optimistic. But I am intentional about protecting my brain health and have spent a good deal of effort learning how to increase my longevity. I will accept my fate when it comes, but my good habits and anti-aging science have about 60 years to work before I reach the age that my granparents died.

 Yep. I use IF regularly and have extended fasts a few times per year. Keep body fat low, cardio up, moderate muscle mass, and 8 hours of sleep is manditory. I eat basically zero sugar and very little processed foods, meditate regularly, and take my vitamins.

Isn't stem cell stuff old technology?*) 
 
 yeah, they are using stem cells on wound sites to just tell the organism that a limb is supposed to go there and the organism takes care of the rest.

 First stage is because young men are stupid. The second stage is due to the fact you lose something like 4% of your strength every year once you hit your 30s, unless you work to keep it. Adaptation response, and if your body is adapting to sitting and Netflix, you'll slowly kill yourself with a slip in the bath, stair or whatever.

 Yep. A sub goal is to be able to do a proper squat into old age. Peter Attia has this idea of the 'centenarian olympics', where old people do events that simulate meaningful life events like bending down to pick up your great grand child (goblet squat).

(re @cafebedouin : *Problem is that people want 100% truth. As far as science goes, speed of light is as close as it gets, and there's reason to doubt. Where there's doubt, people will fill the space with their ideas, which drives the truth value down further.*) 
 
 The majority of scientists probably doesn't ask such questions like "do laws of nature change with time" or "are there laws of nature". Kuhn would probably say they do mop-up work. I think that's okay. Otherwise, there probably would be no engineering done ever. We need those people for "progress". But I would love to see scientists talk more about philosophy of science. 

For me 100% truth comes only in if - then statements. That's okay for me, because I am used to it from mathematics. But I think for most people that is pretty hard to accept. And I think for most scientists as well. On the one hand, because if you move away from philosophy and mathematics in the direction of science, the number of implicit assumptions increases and basically makes it impossible to be aware of all of them and on the other hand, because they want to show more than if-then statements afer working for years on the same topic.

 MSM, "activist" businessmen (like ones profiting from hysterical European schoolgirl Greta) and others involved in climate business are surely doing fear mongering as usually, 

For actual predictions on models, the only way to check them is to record predictions for some moment of time and then wait and check. Which could be unfair btw, as a model could be blind in the short-term but produce accurate long-term predictions. Backtracking could also be used. This is not my field, to be honest, and I do not know any model with proven predictive power.

The story behind humanity's greatest environmental success is too rarely told and too often taken for granted. This is how humanity fixed the ozone layer and why it matters.

I think a big problem is we aren‚Äôt seeing an optimized response to the possible disaster, such as transition to nuclear power. Instead we see a shill response that serves to line pockets and fear monger. That probably reduces public trust

 I think there is a big difference between how much governments talk about climate change and the actual policy action. I think government promotes more external fear than internal action.

 Maybe due to religion I guess


[11/01/2022 6:23 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Also, that in some sense evolution implies devolution, which implies value judgment.


[11/01/2022 6:23 PM] ady2333#0000
But I don't see any firm proofs of it either


[11/01/2022 6:23 PM] chucked1993#0000
(re  : *<sunshadow> its quite clear that man is DEVOLVING*) 
 
 So individually devolving maybe, well at least in the sense you mean

And at a smaller scale as well. The vital question by nick lane is a good read


[11/01/2022 6:25 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Culture is all about repackaging and evolving current forms. So yeah, agree.

[11/01/2022 6:27 PM] chucked1993#0000
(re @cafebedouin : *Culture is all about repackaging and evolving current forms. So yeah, agree.*) 
 
 Example would be just look at Olympic performance in the 50s to now. Mostly just cultural evolution, but big changes in performance.

>With odds standing at 1 chance in 10164 of finding a functional protein among the possible 150-amino-acid compounds, the probability is 84 orders of magnitude (or powers of ten) smaller than the probability of finding the marked particle in the whole universe.

(re @glasgowm : *Neanderthals were and there's lots of research there, and they're in our DNA now. Know less about the others, some fairly recent discoveries.*) 
 
 Same way as we could have evolved. Is there not a chance that by coincidence we have similar DNA and are not related?

"The ‚ÄùThe Ecology of Money‚Äú book by Richard Douthwaite 5 states the following
questions about a currency:

    Who creates the money?
    Why do they create money?
    How do they create money?
    When do they create money?
    What gives money its value?
    Where is the money created?
    How well does the money work?
    Is the money compatible with sustainability?

So I start this topic to gradually collect all possible answers on all the questions."

Would be good to analyze fiat as well as cryptocurrencies with a framework like this one


[11/02/2022 8:52 AM] fruittree#0000
maybe involved withh "how do they create money" but I think an important one with crypto and CBDCs is distribution and inflation, emission etc aspects that can seem subtle and unimportant but in the end have a major role.

But, clearly cbdc will focus on interbank transfers, cross-border payments and financial instruments. Trying to broaden that in a cash equivalent probably not a tradeoff they will want to make.

 Efficiency. Legacy systems for ACH and stock transfers take days instead of minutes. Also, the problem with dollars is there aren't enough of them to support the global financial system. So, having a common platform to increase supply above the central bank system seems like something else you'd want if you were in change of it.

 Eu is focusing on "retail cbdc"

Wholesale is what you describe. Those are just current focus, they are all undecided.

 But, that's my point. Wholesale vs retail has different objectives and has different tradeoffs. As a global reserve currency, it makes more sense to focus on wholesale.

 Banks or some others will stay as intermediaries.

They flashed the option of CBs bypassing them, but there was too much pushback, so now they promise to keep the same structure.

 Cbdc is most likely programmable, like cryptos. That opens a lot of opportunities.

Current digital dollars on your bank account cant be shut off, or sent to smart contracts.

Those things work wether the database is centralized or decentralized.

 What these people say beyond topics where they have direct control is largely irrelevant. What Jerome thinks needs to happen to control interest rates is one thing. His ideas about cbdc and what will actually be implemented is quite a different matter. Also, it behooves him to keep it open-ended. So, no expectation of truth on this front.

 Yeah. Might be trending that way.

Dabbling with btc is still long way from opting out.

I still think cbdc might not be a trigger. People who dont care atm will think its a good idea. Maybe even a saviour out of the current mess. Then again, they might drop the narrative ball, and trigger escape as you say. In my view the first option is more probable.

 People have different tolerances for inconvenience. Why aren't more people using Linux on the desktop? Why don't more people run their own servers? Why don't more people barter for goods and services? Why don't more people do their own: cooking, home repair, etc.? Because all of these things have costs in capital, time and ultimately, convenience. Also, there are relationships to consider. I'm happy to use Linux, my wife wants a back-up machine in case hers fails for work. Is it easier to dual boot, run WSL on Windows or use her machines with a USB drive and TailsOS? Everything is like this and subject to context.

@r32a_ @lightning For what it's worth, I also noticed this bug and disclosed it to @roasbeef about two weeks ago. The btcd repo doesn't seem to have a reporting policy for security bugs, so not sure if anyone else working on btcd found out about it.

Hey guys this is not related to Ergo but I wanted to share.

Taday is remembrance day in Canada. A day marked for us to remember those that died fighting for what is left of our freedom in Canada. 

Below is a poem by John McRae, a Canadian soldier who fought during WWII. Flanders Field is the site of a large battle where many Canadian lives were lost and where the soldier were burried.

"In Flanders fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row,
    That mark our place; and in the sky
    The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.

We are the Dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
    Loved and were loved, and now we lie,
        In Flanders fields.

Take up our quarrel with the foe:
To you from failing hands we throw
    The torch; be yours to hold it high.
    If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
        In Flanders fields."

I like this point made in this video that people will cry for more legislation for crypto because of FTX but those people forget that there is already sufficient laws that should stop these kind of things. 

But they don't stop them. So obviously the solution is not more government.

 I assume we refer to both, legislation and enforcement, as "goverment". Both are complex, so there doesn't only exist "more" and "less", but also "different". So maybe we need different goverment. Or different and more. Or more, but different...

But even if there were only more or less government, then we would map the amount of government to two outcomes, "something like the FTX story happens" or "... doesn't happen". You argue that because amount x maps to "...happens", also amount x+y maps to "...happens". That's neither obvious nor necessarily true.

Let's look at a different situation. Imagine someone drives his car with 50 km/h against a wall and dies. Then one could use the same argument and say "he reduced his speed from 100km/h to 50km/h, so obviously the solution is not more speed reduction". That's probably wrong.

Furthermore, in reality we aren't talking about binary outcomes like "does happen" and "does not happen", but many different outcomes like "happens very often", "happens often",...

So, maybe, with a stricter speed limit of 30km/h people still crash and die, but that happens less often and if it happens less people die (e.g. only people in front row).

So more goverment might help to reduce the number of incidents as well as the severity. Maybe it wouldn't, I don't know.

I just think that even if you think that more goverment doesn't help, using wrong, oversimplifying arguments doesn't help.


[11/13/2022 8:40 PM] fruittree#0000
I figured people could fall into two main categories. They would assume what i intended accurately or they would completely disagree and we wouldn't meet eye to eye anyhow so i oversimplify to save time and effort.

I'll assume you are asking what I would suggest for more specifics, so i will answer that.

I think people can go with improving governments and succeed eventually but as it is now there are many layers of corruption blocking this process from evolving as it was intended to. Has been for decades at least imo.

My preference is to empower the individuals. Give the humans the freedom, knowledge and power to get educated and make the choices that result in as much solutions to coercion and corruption as can be done on that level of interaction.

Where that fails, let people choose from an array of solution and not legitimize the tyranny model where people are forced into a "government of the land" through violence and coercion by the "peace keepers" police of the systems in place. I just see this as a faulty foundation. So I say less of that which most people consider government.

 
Like how ergo empower individuals to become responsible for their own funds and global banking etc. We can also create simple solutions for private contracts, mediators, b2p, education, supply chains( Edit, I want to add in Justice systems cuz that is more fun than most topics)etc. Yeah there may be more risk and responsibility in the short term.


[11/13/2022 8:47 PM] chucked1993#0000
I agree, there must be something outside the Nation and regulation to better balance power between governments/aristocrats/plutocrats and peoples. Decentralization and knowing your assumptions are important aspects of the new emancipation and sovereignty movement in crypto.

 Ideally, so far that someone who doesn't share your view can follow your reasoning.

For example, why do you think that more goverment in form of more audit, disclosure, transparency and reporting requirements for very large centralized exchanges and better (more often, more and better trained people) regulatory supervision of that processes wouldn't mitigate the problem?

Do you think more transparency, disclosure and reporting requirements for very large centralized exchanges wouldn't empower individuals with knowledge to make better decisions?

Isn't it possible to develop simple solutions for private contracts,... even if there are more disclosure,... requirements for large centralized exchanges?

"why do you think that more goverment in form of more audit, disclosure, transparency and reporting requirements for very large centralized exchanges and better (more often, more and better trained people) regulatory supervision of that processes wouldn't mitigate the problem?" 

Corruption is the big obstacle and then the speed at which current systems apply growth and to do this while avoiding the corruption that the centralized governmental systems have become a hive for.


"Do you think more transparency, disclosure and reporting requirements for very large centralized exchanges wouldn't empower individuals with knowledge to make better decisions?"

If it was displayed in a digestible form to users and is all done correctly without corruption it could. Would this be the ideal form though I would ask myself since this will require a lot of input, more imo than creating new foundations and guidelines.

for example new systems where this is done voluntarily by centralized exchanges as a response the FTX fiasco. Additionally with some non biased peer review etc. or better yet grass roots formation of these with easy to digest summaries.

 Hmm, I think even if regulators define templates for disclosure and reporting exchanges will use their leeway to deceive receivers, so I think this will be even more problematic if there is no template. 

Actually, I think many of the points you probably want to see are also what regulators/standard setters want. For example, atm standards for ESG disclosure are missing. Companies publish sustainability reports, which are usually very long, use non-standardized and non-audited performance measures and tell cute stories. But the problem is that they are hard to compare between companies and don't give an objective overview. Hence, regulators want to introduce standards.

There are accounting reasearchers around the globe discussing disclosure and publishing peer-reviewed papers. They are discussing with and advising regulators and auditors. I know that, because I know some of them. Furthermore, regulators are pretending to aim for digestible and useful reports.

I think it really boils down to the corruption and bias argument. Are researchers at universities around the globe trustworthy? Is their peer review biased? Is the majority of standard setters corrupt? I don't think so. Not every step is great, but I am not sure alternative systems are better protected against corruption and bias.

(re @ady2333 : *I think to your first  point it will become the only option eventually*) 
 
 Probably depends on whether regulators distinguish between centralized and decentralized actors/protocols or at least size (so that small decentralized protocols are excluded). But yeah, that's one risk.

It's about severity and frequency, not only about examples when something went wrong. No system is perfect.

Unregulated defi failed many times as well. Hacks, scams, economic collapse. No system is perfect. What counts is utility versus cost and frequency and severity of failure.

Maybe with crypto being a new industry it has too many loopholes to avoid regulation


[11/13/2022 11:09 PM] chucked1993#0000
Dude, there are loopholes in traditional finance


[11/13/2022 11:09 PM] chucked1993#0000
Why do you think Bitcoin was made


[11/13/2022 11:09 PM] ady2333#0000
(re @chucked1993 : *Dude, there are loopholes in traditional finance*) 
 
 Ik but it's been around so long that it's easier for regulators to regulate


[11/13/2022 11:10 PM] chucked1993#0000
I‚Äôm saying regulators fail at regulating traditional finance


[11/13/2022 11:10 PM] ady2333#0000
Loopholes are to help the rich and are there on purpose ik


[11/13/2022 11:10 PM] ady2333#0000
(re @chucked1993 : *I‚Äôm saying regulators fail at regulating traditional finance*) 
 
 Not as badly as they are failing at crypto


[11/13/2022 11:11 PM] chucked1993#0000
Then you want a revolution that creates competent regulators?


[11/13/2022 11:11 PM] chucked1993#0000
(re @ady2333 : *Not as badly as they are failing at crypto*) 
 
 No they are, just crypto isn‚Äôt backed the same way by a central bank and a country


[11/13/2022 11:11 PM] ady2333#0000
I don't think will be instant will take time


[11/13/2022 11:12 PM] ady2333#0000
Maybe one of the issue is that it's global


[11/13/2022 11:12 PM] ady2333#0000
Different rules depending on where company is based


[11/13/2022 11:12 PM] chucked1993#0000
I‚Äôm skeptical on that, so I won‚Äôt push for more regulation that will inevitably helps the rich and screws the poor. But if the system changes then, yea, I would be open to it


[11/13/2022 11:12 PM] chucked1993#0000
(re @ady2333 : *Different rules depending on where company is based*) 
 
 Yea, why regulation is some weird fantasy word


[11/13/2022 11:13 PM] ady2333#0000
I think it's weird that ftx had their own token as their reserves


[11/13/2022 11:14 PM] ady2333#0000
Something like that shouldn't really happen


[11/13/2022 11:14 PM] ady2333#0000
At least not for a centralised entity


[11/13/2022 11:15 PM] ady2333#0000
If you are holding someone else's funds there must be rules of what you can and can't do with those funds?


[11/13/2022 11:15 PM] chucked1993#0000
(re @ady2333 : *Something like that shouldn't really happen*) 
 
 And yet American regulators let it happen


[11/13/2022 11:15 PM] chucked1993#0000
Wait till you learn about naked shorting and FTDs. Mountains of corruption


[11/13/2022 11:15 PM] ady2333#0000
(re @chucked1993 : *And yet American regulators let it happen*) 
 
 The problem starting with ftx global didn't it?


[11/13/2022 11:16 PM] chucked1993#0000
It did


[11/13/2022 11:16 PM] chucked1993#0000
This is not a problem just in crypto.


[11/13/2022 11:17 PM] ady2333#0000
Well if regulators allow these loopholes on purpose maybe we do need a regulatory revolution


[11/13/2022 11:17 PM] chucked1993#0000
It just cleans itself out faster in crypto


[11/13/2022 11:17 PM] chucked1993#0000
Which imo is a good thing


[11/13/2022 11:17 PM] ady2333#0000
It is but people are dumb


[11/13/2022 11:18 PM] ady2333#0000
While ftt was collapsing Luna was going up 30 or 40%


[11/13/2022 11:18 PM] ady2333#0000

[11/13/2022 11:19 PM] chucked1993#0000
(re @ady2333 : *Well if regulators allow these loopholes on purpose maybe we do need a regulatory revolution*) 
 
 If Ergo/Bitcoin deliver on the vision of defi and sovereignty. Then maybe they will be forced to regulate properly to compete.


[11/13/2022 11:20 PM] chucked1993#0000
(re @ady2333 : *It is but people are dumb*) 
 
 So the real goal is fix this


[11/13/2022 11:20 PM] ady2333#0000
(re @chucked1993 : *So the real goal is fix this*) 
 
 Unfortunately I don't think it can be fixed


[11/13/2022 11:20 PM] chucked1993#0000
People should be accountable for their actions, right?


[11/13/2022 11:20 PM] ady2333#0000
Which is why I think regulation the "easier" option


[11/13/2022 11:20 PM] ady2333#0000
But like u say current system isn't right


[11/13/2022 11:20 PM] chucked1993#0000

 That's gonna affect way too many people. I'm of the opinion most are dumb


[11/13/2022 11:21 PM] chucked1993#0000
I will try to educate, not control


[11/13/2022 11:21 PM] ady2333#0000
Crypto kind of proves it


[11/13/2022 11:21 PM] chucked1993#0000
(re @ady2333 : *That's gonna affect way too many people. I'm of the opinion most are dumb*) 
 
 Most people aren‚Äôt dumb, they don‚Äôt have the time to think


[11/13/2022 11:22 PM] chucked1993#0000
But I think, some will learn why decentralization and knowing your assumptions is important


[11/13/2022 11:22 PM] ady2333#0000
Maybe too conditioned


[11/13/2022 11:24 PM] ady2333#0000
If I'm honest I think ergo will go the same way


[11/13/2022 11:24 PM] chucked1993#0000
I think it‚Äôs an upward battle, we have to start with helping those around us. You know, not be too abrasive and explain why some projects are good and others are bad. But at the end of the day the choice is up to them


[11/13/2022 11:24 PM] ady2333#0000
Right now it's small so decentralisation wins


[11/13/2022 11:24 PM] ady2333#0000
Once it gets more adoption it will slowly shift


[11/13/2022 11:24 PM] chucked1993#0000
(re @ady2333 : *Right now it's small so decentralisation wins*) 
 
 Yes, scale is the final test isn‚Äôt it


[11/13/2022 11:24 PM] ady2333#0000
Yea


[11/13/2022 11:25 PM] chucked1993#0000
It‚Äôs actually kind of sad, isn‚Äôt it


[11/13/2022 11:25 PM] chucked1993#0000
Hahah


[11/13/2022 11:25 PM] chucked1993#0000
Cardano has relatively good culture at scale


[11/13/2022 11:25 PM] chucked1993#0000
Hopefully we can be better


[11/13/2022 11:25 PM] ady2333#0000
Yeah hopefully


[11/13/2022 11:26 PM] chucked1993#0000
We just have to be what we want to see, they will copy the culture they find


[11/13/2022 11:26 PM] ady2333#0000
Maybe growing slower is actually good in a way


[11/13/2022 11:26 PM] chucked1993#0000
That‚Äôs the hope at least


[11/13/2022 11:26 PM] ady2333#0000
Getting a bigger core


[11/13/2022 11:26 PM] ady2333#0000
Maybe harder to corrupt in the future


[11/13/2022 11:26 PM] chucked1993#0000
(re @ady2333 : *Maybe growing slower is actually good in a way*) 
 
 Yea, we have to keep having discussions


[11/13/2022 11:30 PM] ady2333#0000
You know in terms of price this exchange crash could be good


[11/13/2022 11:30 PM] ady2333#0000
Firstly gets rid of bad actors


[11/13/2022 11:31 PM] ady2333#0000
Second it will help educate users to keep funds off exchanges


[11/13/2022 11:31 PM] ady2333#0000
Less funds on exchanges to crash prices

 What's the story here? No doubt Zelenskyy is corrupt but with the FTX stuff I haven't seen anything besides vague allusions to money laundering being thrown around on twitter


[11/17/2022 11:55 AM] chucked1993#0000
Zelenskyy is laundering American tax payer money for the American military industrial complex through this war. Not too sure how FTX is involved


[11/17/2022 12:00 PM] glasgowm#0000
I would guess SBF donating to the democrats is the connection made by the artist

[11/17/2022 12:10 PM] Calum#0000
Forwarded from Calum: 'The end of crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs FTX.com exchange may also wipe out two major US political donors.

Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, threw more money at Democrats this cycle than anyone but George Soros, according to OpenSecrets data. One of his top lieutenants, Ryan Salame, has been bankrolling Republicans at almost the same pace as Steve Schwarzman and Peter Thiel.

The two men spent a combined $61.3 million in this election cycle. But on Election Day, when they might‚Äôve been watching to see how their investments in the political process were playing out, FTX found itself caught in a firestorm of speculation and outflows. That culminated in a bombshell announcement from Bankman-Fried: FTX was being bought by rival crypto exchange Binance.'

[11/17/2022 12:11 PM] Calum#0000
The MSM reaction to the FTX stuff is bizarre given how anti-crypto they usually are. Most outlets seem to be going with 'how could anyone have seen this coming?'


[11/17/2022 12:15 PM] chucked1993#0000
The establishment wanted FTX to be their CEX. Kevin O‚ÄôLeary said he would still invest in SBF.


[11/17/2022 12:16 PM] chucked1993#0000
Lots of weird stuff going on. For instance tokenized stocks which were not collateralized were used to short traditional market stocks


[11/17/2022 12:19 PM] Calum#0000
(re @chucked1993 : *The establishment wanted FTX to be their CEX. Kevin O‚ÄôLeary said he would still invest in SBF.*) 
 
 Yeah that's the impression I've got but not clear on whether the agenda was to assimilate crypto or slowly smother it


[11/17/2022 12:19 PM] chucked1993#0000
Assimilate


[11/17/2022 12:20 PM] chucked1993#0000

Hard to know exact plans. Probably shift to tokenized stock market as well + CBDC.

"Alongside the tokenization of USD, Emurgo will soon enable the conversion of other stablecoins, such as USD Coin (USDC) and tether (USDT) to USDA, with long-term plans to enable conversion and swaps of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies."

Redeeming Tether strikes me as setting yourself up for serious counterparty risk.

@statelayer Their policy needs to be updated to say:
As soon as you unlock your account, Infura will collect your IP address and *all* of your addresses.  Also, when you connect a ledger it will send all of those addresses to Infura as well.

From the publication's About page: "our journalism is always politically committed; rather than seeking to moderate between two sides of a debate, our output actively intends to feed back into political action."

Totally. Kushti made a post earlier today stating "politics (or media-driven simulation of it)". Still thinking about what that fully represents, but it seems related

In short, "what useful thing do blockchains do?" And a variation, "what useful thing does Ergo do?" What I think is interesting about these questions is if you think of some goal, say providing financial services to people without access to them via Internet connectivity and cell phones, it raises questions about whether this could be provided in some other way, as happens in Africa, using centralized services? Pick any topic you like, providing a deed to digital assets to creating new kinds of assets, such as a digital gold based currency, or automating certain types of transactions. There are many uses we could point to, but I don't know enterprise solutions well enough to say that they are better than, say, what a major bank could roll out with a distributed database system or whatever. Same question applies to Ergo. If block chains aren't solutions looking for problems, what is the problem space and what unique things does Ergo bring to solve these problems. I'm not as clear about these answers as I'd like to be, so I thought I'd drop this in here as food for thought.

 The author seems too biased to see the other side of the argument. Dismissing all except VC - AWS arguments as an automation.

Centralized database is more efficient than decentralized database. What you get from the latter is removing the middleman.

The middleman (finance, politics) has been growing in terms of control (hard to live without a bank account), and fees (financial industry is a growing parasite on the real economy). 

At some point, the cost of a middleman became larger than the cost in efficiency.

 I think the argument he might make: 1) cost / efficiency is a political problem, not a tech problem, 2) you cannot disintermediate trust, 3) the economics need to work, and blockchains will be coopted if they meet a need, such as a digital dollar. So, what need is being filled by decentralized solutions when faced with a digital dollar? I think this is a hard question.

 If 2) is false, then it changes everything. 

I have doubts if POW can do that. Maybe it ends up centralized, but it is making a difference already.

It enables people to opt out, which works as a check on the centralized powers. Also, it provides a lifeline in places, where centralized services have failed people (e.g. Turkey, Venezuela).

Digital dollar is not an option for those who want to opt out.

https://humantraffickingsearch.org/resource/modern-slavery-the-true-cost-of-cobalt-mining/

'More than half of the world‚Äôs cobalt is mined in the DRC, and the country‚Äôs government estimates that 20% of all cobalt production in the country comes from so-called artisanal mines that rely on human muscle (they would be better described as manual mines). In the DRC, there are at least 100,000 artisanal cobalt miners, and according to UNICEF, approximately 40,000 of those miners are children. But despite being a naturally resource-rich country, DRC is also the second poorest economy in the world. Life expectancy there is just 47 years for men, and 51 years for women. That compares to 81.2 years for the average UK citizen.

While some observers suggest that the expected surge in cobalt demand provides a much-needed source of income for people in the DRC, in reality artisanal miners are barely being paid enough to survive. Recent research by Amnesty International found that children as young as seven are working in cobalt mines, often for less than $2 a day.'

> A more controversial aspect of the policy of the Whig government in 1846 was their decision not to continue Peel‚Äôs policy of importing Indian corn to Ireland but to leave food importation to market forces, despite the fact that the shortfall in food supply was far higher than in the previous year. This decision was due to a mixture of ideological and practical considerations. Peel‚Äôs intervention in the market place in 1845 had angered many merchants and grain producers. One of the first actions of the new administration was to assure this powerful interest group that only a limited number of government food depots would be opened in the west of Ireland. Instead, food imports were to be left to the workings of the market. Inevitably, merchants were tempted to seek high profits outside Ireland and the food shortages in the rest of Europe, including Britain, ensured that there was a ready market for their goods.

But the "real value of labor" is the market price for that labor. While it feels bad to compare a factory workers wage to that of someone in the US, that wage has a substantial positive impact on their lives and the factory as a whole benefits their community. Not to apologize for shitty practices at any particular factory or whatever- we should all absolutely abide by what we learned from the history of industrialization and unionization... But just saying that everyone deserves the same amount of pay is flat out wrong

Yea, i'd really like to know where the world would be today had the world let the US default in 71 instead of going full blown ponzi. It'd be so much easier to measure what's an impact of capitalism, whats an impact of imperialism, and whats and impact of ponzi dollars.

 Raising wages to a threshold whereby people can afford to live isn't artificially inflating it imo, I'd argue much of our current system is set up to artificially push down wages - prohibition of unions/strike action, artificially enforced scarcity etc.

If iPhones can't be built sustainably without slave labour in the supply chain then maybe they shouldn't exist, I have heard that life was okay without them.

Of course it's a lot harder once the jack is out of the box with new technologies and standards of living. And yes I'm a total hypocrite as I own a smartphone

 All else being equal I'd agree but oftentimes the only reason that work is the only thing left is because of larger economic (imperialist) powers seizing land and introducing protectionism that kills off their exports.

E.g. Mexico after NAFTA

Not to mention, if we return to the iPhone example, does Tim Cook create more value for Apple than the miners who extract the essential mineral components? Sure I'll grant that, but to the extent that he's a multimillionaire and they're essentially trapped in indentured servitude? Nah I don't think that's a reflection of value

They took other countries gold, gave em USD, than they printed themselves USD (leverage) and used that to buy goods overseas. When they got called out in the 60s it created a bank run on US reserves, and the US had to stop honoring the convertibility of the dollars because they didnt have the reserves they claimed to have.

Artificial Intelligence influence on governing systems is a bit blurry in my crystal ball but i think similarly, if it is designed without negative influence it will be benign and beneficial to humans generally, or say peace out and fly away.

There're many ways to organise society along either axis but I think it's probably the most important distinction to make re: economics

 I think it could be used to inform decision making but ultimately the future is too dynamic to govern things based on past data alone. Intuition and *gulp* some form of ideology will always have to fil in the gaps unfortunately

(re @fruittree : *Do you guys think these capitalism or communism governing models summarize all the options available? It seems like people debate them because these are the only options and people believe we are at a cross roads in society.. or what? 

Are you guys aware of open government models? basically full transparency. I've said it before and I'll say it again. I think first obstacle is avoiding corruption, coercion and keeping the systems actions in line, not to mention freedom for people to opt out. 

...*) 
 
 First, it's important to draw distinctions between politics and economics. We don't have good models of what alternative economic models look like at scale. They don't exist, probably because capitalism is driven by growth and profit, and anything that threatens those because it values something else is summarily destroyed. You can use forms of capitalism in non-typical ways, such as an employee owned corporation that distributes shares. But, it is hard to imagine what the world would look like if that were the norm, just as it is hard to imagine any other kind of economic system at scale.  

Just to point to one example, if we imagine a post-scarcity world, a la The Culture, production would likely be under the gift economy.

And, of course, this gets to the central question: who owns the means of production? What obstacles can be used to influence decisions along certain lines, say OPEC and having the hand of the spigot of energy might give you in larger geopolitical conversations.

The only thing I am sure about is any change will have a high body count because it means someone is eating someone else's lunch, which of course begs the question of that conversation about whose lunch is really is that underpins these conversations.


[12/05/2022 8:03 PM] fruittree#0000
I just figure Real AI would be good intentioned..

The Government/Economic model ideas, I just think they both historically failed many times over. What else can we do, seems sticking to simple rules and avoiding putting individual people in positions of excess power is the starting point that hasn't happened yet. Yeah natural resources would need to be managed carefully but almost anything is likely better than our current situation.

Yeah people don't want to actually do much activism because that might result in prison time or worse.. but YOLO lol.


[12/05/2022 8:04 PM] cafebedouin#0000
Also, AI isn't going to save us. The Culture is a good example of that issue too. Reasonable people, and machines, can look at the same set of facts and come to radically different conclusions depending on what they value.

 I don't see the value in reducing the aspects to capitalism in your first paragraph. I would replace the first capitalism with rampant corruption. I find it unnecessarily confusing to the readers.*

I can imagine the alt systems at scale pretty well. I can also imagine multiple systems co-existing on the same land bodies.. people free to enter one system and experience it, leave some assets in that system and choose to live in another model. Not so different than how crypto Defi works. Diff chains have their rules, they interreact under strict rules. People have the freedom to use what chain or system they want to. Sure if they stole and killed in one system their Public aspects of a ID would show that and they would be held responsible etc. we can also imagine other aspects of course.

..no change also has a high body count, so it seems change is essential. What is your preferred route?

 You seem to think of politics and economics as somehow identical. Normally, I think of big business and big government as two different things with sometimes competing interests. Corruption is how you can get those interests to align better, from the point of view of big business. Alternative systems will emerge in places where the market cannot discipline them and there are incentives to create them. For example, a colony on Mars where everyone needs everyone else to survive. Or, places where potable water is scarce, which will be common problem everywhere in the coming decades.

My preferred route is not to get killed by it. I don't have any illusions the world will ever conform to my ideas. It's one of the advantages of being a home rule, anarchist without adjectives, you never get to believe your way of thinking will ever be the norm. Even communists will put you up against the wall in their revolution.

In short, "what useful thing do blockchains do?" And a variation, "what useful thing does Ergo do?" What I think is interesting about these questions is if you think of some goal, say providing financial services to people without access to them via Internet connectivity and cell phones, it raises questions about whether this could be provided in some other way, as happens in Africa, using centralized services? Pick any topic you like, providing a deed to digital assets to creating new kinds of assets, such as a digital gold based currency, or automating certain types of transactions. There are many uses we could point to, but I don't know enterprise solutions well enough to say that they are better than, say, what a major bank could roll out with a distributed database system or whatever. Same question applies to Ergo. If block chains aren't solutions looking for problems, what is the problem space and what unique things does Ergo bring to solve these problems. I'm not as clear about these answers as I'd like to be, so I thought I'd drop this in here as food for thought.

 The author seems too biased to see the other side of the argument. Dismissing all except VC - AWS arguments as an automation.

Centralized database is more efficient than decentralized database. What you get from the latter is removing the middleman.

The middleman (finance, politics) has been growing in terms of control (hard to live without a bank account), and fees (financial industry is a growing parasite on the real economy). 

At some point, the cost of a middleman became larger than the cost in efficiency.

 I think wrapped assets is a good idea helping to isolate risks. Overcollateralization is also good, if we are talking about building secure and resilient financial tools, and with transparency of on-chain operations we also can quickly obtain knowledge on what is going on in the system.

And in 2022 crypto, centralized offchain part of "crypto" failed (3AC, FTX / Alameda, DCG) among with protocols having centralized components (Serum) or not targeting resilience (Terra, USDN)

Depends on how you think of what a wrapped asset means. For example, a deed on a house is a wrapped asset. It's s legal document, but what you are really buying is the house. Most of traditional finance is stacked in this way. I buy an annuity, the insurance company puts into index funds, guarantees a certain rate of return over some period, and they make money on the difference between guaranteed percent and actual. So, many wrapped layers in that kind of product: cash -> synthetic annuity -> buying indexed stock fund, which buys stocks -> etc. It's easier to deal with representations and to keep abstracting. There was a time people used stock certificates, bearer bonds and the like. But, physical security is hard.

Is using AI as part of a DeFi protocol compatible with "know your assumptions"? 

Imo AI is a black box and if AI makes decisions it doesn't satisfy KYA. If it only acts as an advisor, then the protocol is probably not really decentralized.


[01/13/2023 8:23 PM] wombo22#5461
Doesn‚Äôt AI only know what you feed it?


[01/13/2023 8:26 PM] wombo22#5461
So could you say that It does satisfy it  considering you know what your giving it?


[01/13/2023 8:36 PM] Gstoiti#0000
(re  : *<wombo22> So could you say that It does satisfy it  considering you know what your giving it?*) 
 
 I always understood KYA as the ability to know how the protocol reacts/works in a given situation. Since AI usually uses machine learning, which uses randomness, that's not really possible if (such an) AI is involved, even if I know the inputs.

AI just seems like a blackbox to me. You put something in and get something out, but have no real idea which input will generate which output.


[01/13/2023 8:49 PM] wombo22#5461
That makes sense

(re  : *<Glasgow> Struggling to think where youd use AI in a protocol. If it's to generate some parameter, as long as it's within predefined bounds it should be fine?*) 
 
 For example, to predict markets (price, volatility,...). I don't think "within predefined bounds" is a good criterion, because the range could be very big. Furthermore, then some guy generating the parameter within predefined bounds would be okay as well.


[01/13/2023 9:07 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Are AIs rational? I am just thinking about the difference between AI components in protocols and human components like arbitrage trading. For humans we usually assume rationality and profit-maximizing and that allows us to predict outputs for given inputs. Can we do the same for AI? Is knowing the objective function of an AI sufficient?


[01/13/2023 9:33 PM] glasgowm#9381
We do understand what ai is doing mathematically and theoretically. We just don't understand the patterns they've found immediately without doing a little bit of extra investigative work. The dangers are of course, if you don't know what patterns your model has learned, it can make decisions based on things you didn't expect, e.g. by racially profiling people via some highly correlated variables when you're deciding if somebody can take out a loan.

But generally it's just a big statistical model that counts probabilities in data to figure out the best choice(s) in future on similar data. 

A badly designed defi protocol could set a huge dangerous range of course,  but for simple and narrow decisions it's fairly 'knowable' and controllable. Don't think you loose anymore autonomy here than you would with a defi protocol that used a random number generator.

 Yeah, sure, AIs are based on algorithms and statistics.

But isn't the fact that we don't know exactly what patterns the AI has learned the point of using AI? Once I know what the AI would do in every situation, I don't need it anymore and can just use a "normal" algorithm/mapping.


[01/13/2023 9:56 PM] glasgowm#9381
The point is to derive mappings from large datasets. You can then use those mappings on new data. Not knowing the working isn't the point it's just not that interesting if you're getting expected results. 

If it had too much autonomy i could see it being a risk but for something small like optimising trading strategies you could certainly know enough to kya imo

 I see. My reasoning was:
- small decision where I can guess what the AI will do ex ante -> use my guess directly instead of AI (probably still use the AI for marketing üòÖ)
- big decision where I can't guess ex ante what the AI will do -> KYA fails.


[01/13/2023 10:11 PM] glasgowm#9381
Benefit is you don't need to pick. As I said struggling to think of actual useful things you'd do on a protocol level. But let's say someone trained a model on kushtis decentralised grid bots after a year. That model could then be used to adjust your buying and selling levels slightly depending on price action, volume, etc to maximise profits. 

Worst case scenario it's slightly less efficient than the strategy you would've picked. But no real risk thatd make me avoid the protocol (unless they hadn't controlled for edge cases e.g. selling all for a fraction of the price by accident because spectrum goes down and messes up the price feed)


[01/13/2023 10:17 PM] Gstoiti#0000
Yeah, I can't think of any useful things with big impact as well. But I didn't look into what all those AI defi projects do.

The problem I see is that the AI might be trained live, hence one would basically need to check edge cases in real time.

I think it's interesting that crypto people always think about crypto when talking about CBDCs, although I don't see any really convincing reason why they should use blockchain technology.

I think of it as the same problem as the Internet. With payments, and currency more generally,  there are advantages to a decentralized system and not having a single point of failure. Depends on the use case though, makes more sense to have centralization if you are talking interbank, stocks and other types of institutional settlements.

 Yeah, although I think that even for retail cbdcs there are better options for central banks to avoid single points of failure and reduce vulnerability to outside attacks than blockchain technology. Imo marketing/hype is the only reason for central banks to consider blockchains.

But it will be interesting to see what countries do and what strategy they choose (first mover advantage or waiting and learning from the problems of others).

I have a theory:
Regulators let the bad guys get big and blow up because it serves their agenda.

1. destroy capital/resources in crypto ecosystem
2. burn people, deter adoption
3. give air cover to attack good actors

The bad guys are actually on-side. Good guys are the enemy.

 The interviewer guy is not too smart. I don't think Rachel-Rose really had any good responses to use POS besides that it is more sustainable.. 

The response to punich by burning after a 51% attack would also have major negative impact in real world and many innocent users would get punished in such a move. the chain would lose a lot of trust in that event.

she did not address the competition of Lending rewards competing with staking and politic games affecting governance more easily in POS vs POW.

I think we need @glasgowm to interview her on video and give some real questions and we can then get a good comparison of who has the stronger accent.

[02/25/2023 9:03 AM] crandano#0000
Forwarded from crandano: Will have to check this out 
‚Äúwritten by Major Jason Lowery, an active-duty US Space Force astronautical engineer and US National Defense Fellow at MIT tasked with advising senior US military leaders about the national strategic implications of Bitcoin. In this thesis, Lowery presents a novel theory to the US Department of Defense that Bitcoin doesn't just represent a peer-to-peer cash system, it also (and more importantly) represents a new form of digital-age warfare that will transform national security, cyber security, and possibly even the base-layer architecture of the internet. Using scientific concepts from biology, evolution, anthropology, political science, and computer theory, Lowery summarizes the dynamics of power projection in human society and provides an argument for why emerging proof-of-work technologies (namely Bitcoin) will have a dramatic impact on how humans organize, cooperate, and compete on a global scale by empowering populations to project physical power in, from, and through cyberspace. Major Lowery concludes that Bitcoin represents a national strategic imperative that the US should support and adopt as quickly as possible, else it risks losing its lead as a global superpower in the 21st century.‚Äù

HCPP22 | Paul Rosenberg - Who Are We Shooting At... And Why?
What, to us, is ‚Äúwinning‚Äù? And how do we attain it? We must have a clear and coherent vision of victory, and an effective path to it. Strategy, philosophy, and passion must rise together. Make no small plans.

Apparently applies to city infrastructure growth as well, as size increases, gas stations, road surface area, electrical cables, etc. They all tend to grow according to Kleiber's law.

 Probably connected to the law governing cell size. Since the volume of a sphere grows faster than it's surface area, cell size is limited to how effectively the surface can take in nutrients and expel waste

Who else will want to do it? The bottom line is that a global reserve currency has to absorb savings from other countries which means either: higher debt or higher unemployment for the nation that's currency is used as the reserve. If you peg it to a stable store of value, then you have boom/bust cycles as savings turns to investment, which eventually gets funneled into unproductive assets because everything has limits. See China's economy, right now. https://twitter.com/michaelxpettis/status/1630071421987880960

 I love dalio and agree that inflation is necessary. I just worry that the power to print money is abused and ruins the relationship with people that are supposed to be allies.

Or inflate away other countries savings in USD?


[02/28/2023 4:50 PM] cafebedouin#9837
This is the key point from the above. Most people don't consider the other side of the equation. What happens when other countries rely on the U.S. to absorb their excess savings, particularly when these non-U.S. governments are engaged in policies that are designed to give their industries a competitive advantage in particular industries. Manufacturing all went to China for a reason, and eventually, the equation has to balance.

"Although inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy. 

As I mentioned, the latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated."

- The speaker highlights the need for the free software movement and Linux to innovate and stop following the footsteps of competitors. They suggest that the community should focus on creating a unique computing paradigm that diverges from the surveillance capitalism model, which prioritizes user data extraction for profit.

- The talk pays tribute to Peter Hintjens, a developer and theorist who advocated for the elegant abstraction approach in software development. Hintjens emphasized the importance of free software as a philosophy that goes beyond merely having accessible code, focusing on creating composable and less complex software.

- Zero Knowledge (ZK) proofs are cryptographic techniques that enable the verification of computations without revealing the inputs used. They offer three main benefits: succinctness (small proof size), computational savings (faster verification than actual computation), and anonymity (hiding input values).

- The mathematical foundations of ZK proofs include the homomorphic properties of functions, polynomial commitments, and the ability to construct any NP-complete program within a ZK proof. These principles allow for secure and private computations.

- Multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption are techniques that facilitate secure computations on secret values, even in shared or public environments. They allow for collaborative processing of encrypted data without exposing the underlying information.

- Merkle trees can be employed to prove the membership of a value within a set without revealing the actual value. This property enables the implementation of anonymous voting systems, where users can vote without disclosing their identities or choices.

- Anonymous cryptocurrencies can be designed using ZK proofs, homomorphic encryption, and atomic swaps to facilitate secure and private transactions. These tech <clipped message>

Forwarded from Narodnik: # Agorist Parallel Society

There are two legacies within technology. What Lewis Mumford calls monotechnics vs ecotechnics: https://wiki.polytech.barcelona/index.php?title=File:Mumford_authoritarian_vs_democratic_technics.pdf

The authoritarian technics (monotechnics) is the state civilization tendency, which is technology that serves power, domination and mechanisation of society. It is a tool to extract wealth from society, for example surveillance capitalism, much of the AI research and automated weapons.

Look how Wikipedia defines civilization: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization

> "Civilizations are organized densely-populated settlements divided into hierarchical social classes with a ruling elite and subordinate urban and rural populations"
> "Civilization concentrates power, extending human control over the rest of nature, including over other human beings."

The other major legacy in technology, is the democratic technics (ecotechnics) tendency. Technology which expands the realm of human activity, or empowers movements within society. It allows people to resist power and act freely in their own parallel spaces. These parallel spaces nurture new thought and are the seeds from which intellectual movements spring forth.

Crypto will make people more autonomous than ever before. And however ruthlessly states behave in the transition period, combining the IRS with the CIA will have no effect. They will be more and more forced to bargain with autonomous society on their terms.

People through DAOs and anonymous crypto-finance will declare their economic independence. When the people conduct their own economic policies over the internet, it will cease to matter that the state controls the industrial-era money-printing. Their importance for controlling the world's wealth will be transcended by mathematical algorithms. Cryptocurrency controlled by anonymous online  <clipped message>

Why, just why are they more and more turning web browsers into operating systems?


[04/07/2023 12:28 AM] Satergo.com#0000
In my mind a web browser exists for two things and two things ONLY: browsing and sharing information. Web applications are a terrible concept and waste so much performance, processing power, and more. This terrible growing mess of a web standard is a massive privacy nightmare and I don't even know where it will go


[04/07/2023 12:30 AM] Satergo.com#0000
Please can somebody tell me why people get excited about running AI models in their browser. About running computer software in their browser. What is the goal here? We could already do these things, why do we need to explode the constraints of the web to include these things... I am just so annoyed.

That's an aspect I missed in that rant of mine, indeed web applications give you 0 control. I can still play unpublished games from many years ago because I have the installation files but good luck doing that with websites. (The internet archive is not helpful in this case)

Chatgpt bros,

Scientific research has a problem created by the journal publishing system. Name, status and network might matter even more than research quality in getting to best journals. Those then get publicized and cited most.

That means, that there may be groundbreaking results or ideas lurking in some never-read-journal pile. 

Chatgpt cant produce science yet, but do you think some prompts could reveal such hidden gems?

I think it's a little extreme:

Disable sticker loop animation! Animated Stickers = danger.
-
Never activate (via */start*) any telegram bot! Do not even touch telegram bots (only public chat bots are considered safe, you can operate them in a public chat via commands), never DM a Telegram bot! (any button can contain a SQLi vulnerability or even worse)!

[04/24/2023 2:42 PM] glasgowm#0000
Note: only open source Matrix clients like Element or SchildiChat can connect to a self-hosted system at this time. Beeper clients require a Beeper account and use Beeper‚Äôs infrastructure.

I'm gonna say some things about that project of mine but it was basically just a test and I haven't worked on it so probably never coming out, but

My idea was to make a super modular instant messaging client, where everything can be switched out. Examples of modules (think of them like puzzle pieces) that make up the app:
- Chat service client implementation (tg, matrix, nostr, etc)
- Navigator interface
- Conversation interface 
- Input interface
- Uploading handler (for example, compression, removal of private data, etc)
- Theme
It was an ambitious project, to say the least.

There‚Äôs some stuff kinda like that, ie https://meetfranz.com/ or more generally https://rambox.app/

but yeh lots of them have fallen to the wayside for being overcomplicated and usually suffer from a small userbase.

Element is fairly developed though, could be a viable unifying replacement if they get bridging right. Or maybe just starts gaining market-share after a few more iterations

Rambox seems like just a collection of different applications, the experience does not look streamlined. Haven't checked the source availability.

Meet franz seems to be limited in the free version, probably not open source either.

Neither of those, not Element either, has the modular application interface/experience aspect.
